Inhibition of TXNRD or SOD1 overcomes NRF2-mediated resistance to β-lapachone

22

Abstract

23

Alterations in the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway result in the constitutive activation of NRF2, leading to

24

the aberrant induction of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes, including NQO1. The NQO1

25

bioactivatable agent β-lapachone can target cells with high NQO1 expression but relies in the

26

generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are actively scavenged in cells with

27

NRF2/KEAP1 mutations. However, whether NRF2/KEAP1 mutations influence the response to

28

β-lapachone treatment remains unknown. To address this question, we assessed the

29

cytotoxicity of β-lapachone in a panel of NSCLC cell lines bearing either wild-type or mutant

30

KEAP1. We found that, despite overexpression of NQO1, KEAP1 mutant cells were resistant to

31

β-lapachone due to enhanced detoxification of ROS, which prevented DNA damage and cell

32

death. To evaluate whether specific inhibition of the NRF2-regulated antioxidant enzymes could

33

abrogate resistance to β-lapachone, we systematically inhibited the four major antioxidant

34

cellular systems using genetic and/or pharmacologic approaches. We demonstrated that

35

inhibition of the thioredoxin-dependent system or copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1)

36

could abrogate NRF2-mediated resistance to β-lapachone, while depletion of catalase or

37

glutathione was ineffective. Interestingly, inhibition of SOD1 selectively sensitized KEAP1

38

mutant cells to β-lapachone exposure. Our results suggest that NRF2/KEAP1 mutational status

39

might serve as a predictive biomarker for response to NQO1-bioactivatable quinones in

40

patients. Further, our results suggest SOD1 inhibition may have potential utility in combination

41

with other ROS inducers in patients with KEAP1/NRF2 mutations.

Introduction

50

It is estimated that 38% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 18% of lung

51

adenocarcinomas (LuAD) harbor mutations in Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2),

52

or its negative regulator Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)1-3, making this pathway

53

one of the most commonly mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The transcription

54

factor NRF2 acts as the primary cellular barrier against the deleterious effects of oxidative

55

stress by regulating the expression of cytoprotective genes. In healthy tissues, KEAP1 binds to

56

and harnesses the activity of NRF2, thereby promoting NRF2 ubiquitination and destruction by

57

the proteasome4-6. Loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1 and gain-of-function mutations in NRF2

58

found in NSCLC abolish this control and lead to constitutive NRF2 activity1,7-9. Cancer cells that

59

hijack NRF2 activity are equipped with a reinforced cytoprotective system through the induction

60

of antioxidant and drug detoxification pathways, thereby rendering them resistant to oxidative

61

stress and chemo/radio-therapy10-12.

62
63

High expression of the detoxification enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a

64

distinct biomarker of NRF2/KEAP1 mutant NSCLC tumors. NQO1 is a cytosolic flavoprotein that

65

catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinones into hydroquinones in an effort to hamper

66

oxidative cycling of these compounds13,14. Although NQO1-dependent reduction of quinones

67

has been historically defined as a major detoxification mechanism, a number of quinones induce

68

toxicity following NQO1 reduction15-19. The mechanism behind this paradox relies on the

69

chemical properties of the hydroquinone forms. Unstable hydroquinones can be reoxidized to

70

the original quinone by molecular oxygen, which leads to the formation of superoxide radicals.

71

As the parent quinone is regenerated, the cycle continues, which amplifies the generation of

72

superoxide radicals, initiating a cascade of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

73
74

The ability of NQO1 to generate cytotoxic hydroquinones has been utilized as a strategy to

75

target cancer cells with high NQO1 levels. To date, β-lapachone and its derivatives are the most

76

studied NQO1-bioactivatable quinones, and the molecular mechanisms by which they promote

77

cytotoxicity have been thoroughly characterized20-24 (Figure 1A). NQO1 has been proposed as

78

a target for NSCLC therapy, as it is overexpressed in lung tumors but not in adjacent normal

79

tissues25,26. Thus, systemic delivery of β-lapachone would spare healthy lung tissue while

80

inducing robust cytotoxicity in tumor cells. Remarkably, a large fraction of NSCLC with high

81

NQO1 also harbor sustained NRF2 activation, which in turn could hinder the cytotoxic effects of

82

β-lapachone through the active scavenging of ROS. Therefore, although high levels of NQO1

83

could be exploited with a therapeutic intent in NRF2/KEAP1 mutant cancer cells, it is unclear

84

whether actions of NRF2 could limit β-lapachone efficacy. In this study, we aim to clarify

85

whether NQO1 represents a druggable strategy for NRF2/KEAP1 mutant NSCLC or,

86

conversely, these alterations promote resistance to β-lapachone.

Results

89

Aberrant activation of NRF2 in NSCLC promotes resistance to B-lapachone

90

We compared the mRNA levels of NQO1 in healthy lung tissue, adenocarcinoma (LuAD) and

91

squamous cell carcinoma (LuSC) patients using the TGCA dataset (Figure 1B). NQO1

92

expression in lung tumors was further subdivided according to the NRF2/KEAP1 mutational

93

state. Both LuAD and SCC tumors had significantly higher NQO1 levels compared to normal

94

lung tissue. Further, tumors harboring NRF2/KEAP1 mutations displayed significantly higher

95

expression of NQO1 than those lacking mutations in this pathway. Remarkably, a number of

96

KEAP1WT

97

overexpression in KEAP1/NRF2WT tumors can also result from alternative mechanisms of NRF2

98

activation (i.e. epigenetic silencing of KEAP127,28, oncogenic activation of NRF229) or through

99

NRF2-independent mechanisms.

To examine the influence of KEAP1/NRF2 mutations on NSCLC response to β-lapachone

102

treatment, we assessed the cytotoxic efficacy of β-lapachone in a panel of sixteen NSCLC cell

103

lines, seven of which harbor characterized inactivating mutations of KEAP1 (Figure 1C, S1A).

104

In line with the mRNA data of LuSC and LuAD patients, KEAP1MUT cell lines displayed uniformly

105

high NQO1 protein levels, while protein levels of NQO1 in KEAP1WT cells were highly variable.

106

To determine the range of doses of β-lapachone that promote cell death in a NQO1-dependent

107

manner, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of β-lapachone alone or in

108

combination with the NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol30,31 (Figure 1D). Additionally, we included in

109

the study Calu-3 cells, which harbor a polymorphic variant of NQO1 (NQO1*3) that results in

110

95% lower enzyme levels32-34 (Figure S1B). To recapitulate β-lapachone in vivo half-life

111

conditions35, cells were treated with β-lapachone for two hours and cell viability was analyzed

112

forty-eight hours after treatment. Our results showed that doses ranging from 1-6 µM induced

113

cell death in a dose-dependent and NQO1-specific manner. Remarkably, KEAP1 mutation

114

conferred resistance to β-lapachone treatment (Figure 1D).

116

To test the ability of KEAP1WT and KEAP1MUT cell lines to promote redox cycling of β-lapachone,

117

we monitored the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using the seahorse bioanalyzer. Basal OCR

118

was monitored prior injection of β-lapachone, and OCR was followed for 2 hours after β-

119

lapachone addition. To validate whether changes in the OCR were a consequence of NQO1-

120

dependent redox cycling of β-lapachone, we also monitored the OCR of cells co-treated with β-

121

lapachone and dicoumarol. Treatment with β-lapachone resulted in a significant increase of the

122

OCR in both KEAP1WT and KEAP1MUT cells, which was precluded by the addition of dicoumarol

123

(Figure 1E). Further, there was no significant difference in the OCR between KEAP1WT and

124

KEAP1MUT cells after β-lapachone treatment, indicating that protein levels of NQO1 in KEAP1WT

125

NSCLC cells are not limiting for redox cycling of β-lapachone. Hence, both KEAP1WT and

126

KEAP1MUT cancer cells are capable of NQO1-dependent redox cycling of β-lapachone at

127

comparable rates.

128
129

To determine whether β-lapachone resistance was NRF2-dependent, H1299 cells (KEAP1WT)

130

were infected with virus encoding for an inactivating mutation of KEAP1 (C273S) or a gain-of

131

function NRF2 mutation (T80K), to promote the aberrant activation of NRF27,36,37. In agreement

132

with our previous findings, overexpression of KEAP1C273S and NRF2T80K but not KEAP1WT led to

133

the accumulation of NRF2, which promoted resistance to β-lapachone exposure (Figure 1F).

134

Consistently, NRF2 silencing by shRNAs markedly reduced resistance to β-lapachone in H460

135

cells (KEAP1MUT) (Figure 1G). Additionally, we compared the β-lapachone sensitivity of NRF2-

136

knockout A549 cells38 infected with a control vector or with virus coding for NRF2 expression

137

(Figure S1C, S1D). In agreement with our previous data, NRF2-knockout cells exhibited

138

increased sensitivity to β-lapachone compared to cells reconstituted for NRF2 expression.

139

Collectively, these results indicate that aberrant activation of NRF2 in KEAP1 mutant lung

140

cancer cells confers resistance to β-lapachone exposure.

141
142

Activation of NRF2 promotes active scavenging of β-lapachone-induced ROS and

143

attenuates DNA damage

144

Given the established role of NRF2 in protection against ROS through the transcriptional

145

regulation of antioxidant enzymes, we evaluated whether KEAP1MUT cells harbor an increased

146

capacity to detoxify β-lapachone-induced ROS. We monitored ROS generation after β-

147

lapachone exposure in our panel of NSCLC cell lines using the fluorogenic probe CellROX

148

Green, as previously described39 (Figure 2A). We found that KEAP1WT cells displayed a

149

significantly higher fold-induction of ROS after 1-hour β-lapachone treatment compared to

150

KEAP1MUT. To confirm whether β-lapachone promotes cell death via induction of ROS, we

151

supplemented the media with exogenous catalase to increase the antioxidant capacity of the

152

cells (Figure 2B). Consistent with prior studies22,40, addition of exogenous catalase abrogated β-

153

lapachone-induced cell death. Next, we assessed whether KEAP1MUT cells were protected

154

against β-lapachone-induced DNA damage32,39. We monitored levels of phosphorylated H2A.X

155

(γ-H2AX), a sensitive molecular marker of DNA damage. We observed a time-dependent

156

accumulation of DNA damage in H1299 cells (KEAP1WT), while A549 cells (KEAP1MUT) did not

157

exhibit increased γ-H2AX following 2-hour treatment with 3 µM β-lapachone (Figure 2C). We

158

extended these analyses to a larger panel of cell lines, and we found that KEAP1WT cells, but

159

not KEAP1MUT cells, accumulated γ-H2AX following β-lapachone exposure (Figure 2D).

160

Accordingly, ectopic expression of KEAP1C273S or NRF2T80K in H1299 cells also promoted

161

resistance to β-lapachone-induced DNA damage and decreased accumulation of ROS (Figure

162

2E,F and S2A).

163
164

We next assessed whether depletion of NRF2 could exacerbate β-lapachone-induced DNA

165

damage in KEAP1MUT cells (Figure 2G). Indeed, shRNA-mediated silencing of NRF2 in H460

166

and HCC15 cells increased γ-H2AX levels following β-lapachone exposure. Lastly, we

167

interrogated ROS and DNA damage levels in NRF2-KO A549s infected with NRF2WT or an

168

empty control vector after β-lapachone treatment (Figure S2B, S2C). Consistently, NRF2-

169

knockout cells exhibited greater production of ROS and accumulation of DNA damage markers

170

compared to cells expressing NRF2. Together, these results demonstrate that constitutive

171

activation of NRF2 in NSCLC protects cells from β-lapachone exposure by decreasing ROS-

172

mediated DNA damage.

173
174

Inhibition of thioredoxin-dependent systems but not catalase and glutathione overcome

175

NRF2-mediated resistance to β-lapachone

176

To sensitize KEAP1MUT lung cancer cells to β-lapachone treatment, we sought to identify and

177

inhibit key NRF2-regulated antioxidant pathways. Given the major role of hydrogen peroxide in

178

mediating β-lapachone toxicity, we tested whether inhibition of individual peroxide detoxification

179

systems could overcome β-lapachone resistance (Figure S3A). First, we tested the relevance

180

of catalase in the sensitivity to β-lapachone by using shRNAs (Figure 3A, 3B). We observed

181

that depletion of catalase did not affect the β-lapachone sensitivity of NSCLC cells, regardless

182

of KEAP1 mutational status. Of note, we found that H460 cells did not express detectable

183

catalase protein (Figure 3B, S3B).

184
185

NRF2 is a major upstream transcriptional regulator of enzymes involved in the thioredoxin- and

186

glutathione-dependent antioxidant systems, which share certain redundancy in detoxifying

187

hydrogen peroxide. We tested whether individual inhibition of the thioredoxin (TXN)- or

188

glutathione-dependent systems could overcome NRF2-mediated resistance to β-lapachone. To

189

inhibit glutathione synthesis, we used buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a well-characterized

190

inhibitor of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL)41. Twenty-four-hour treatment with 100 or 200 µM of

191

BSO depleted >95% of the total pool of glutathione (Figure S3C). To inhibit the TXN-dependent

192

system, cells were treated with 1-5 µM auranofin, a pan-thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD)

193

inhibitor for 2 hours42. We observed a dose-dependent inhibition of both the cytosolic and

194

mitochondrial TXN-dependent systems in KEAP1WT cells, as seen by oxidation of peroxiredoxin

195

1 and 3 (Figure S3D). Interestingly, KEAP1MUT cell peroxiredoxins were resistant to oxidation,

196

and KEAP1WT NSCLC cells are more sensitive to auranofin-induced cell death in the absence of

197

exogenous oxidants (Figure S3E). We next examined the effect of these inhibitors on β-

198

lapachone sensitivity. Depletion of glutathione did not increase the sensitivity to β-lapachone

199

treatment, while auranofin significantly increased β-lapachone-induced cell death and DNA

200

damage in KEAP1MUTcells (Figure 3C and 3D). Similarly, auranofin but not BSO increased

201

sensitivity of KEAP1WT cells to β-lapachone exposure (Figure 3E).

202
203

These data suggest that although inhibition of the TXN-dependent system increases sensitivity

204

of KEAP1MUT cells to β-lapachone, the inherent reinforcement of this antioxidant pathway in

205

KEAP1MUT cells might represent a challenge in vivo. Further, single inhibition of the glutathione

206

or catalase it is not sufficient to increase sensitivity to β-lapachone treatment, suggesting that

207

inhibition of these pathways is compensated by other antioxidant mechanisms.

208
209

Inhibition of SOD1 potentiates β-lapachone anti-tumor efficacy in KEAP1/NRF2MUT NSCLC

210

The inherent redundancy in the peroxide detoxification systems represents a major challenge to

211

sensitize KEAP1MUT cells to ROS generators, as inhibition of one of these pathways may be

212

compensated by other antioxidant enzymes. In contrast, SOD1 has a unique role in catalyzing

213

the dismutation of cytosolic superoxide radicals generated by β-lapachone (Figure 4A). Given

214

this unique role of SOD1, we interrogated the effects of SOD1 inhibition on β-lapachone

215

efficacy. We infected KEAP1MUT cells with virus coding for shRNAs against SOD1 or a non-

216

targeting shRNA (Figure S4A). Depletion of SOD1 markedly increased β-lapachone-mediated

217

cell death in KEAP1MUT cell lines and increased DNA damage (Figure 4B, 4C, S4B).

218

Importantly, β-lapachone treatment did not change SOD1 activity (Figure S4C).

219
220

To validate these findings, we sough to test the effect of pharmacological inhibition of SOD1 on

221

β-lapachone efficacy. However, direct inhibitors of SOD1 that have been shown efficacy in cell-

222

based assays or in vivo are lacking. Importantly, the cytosolic (SOD1) and the extracellular

223

(SOD3) superoxide dismutases require copper and zinc to function, while the mitochondrial

224

isoform (SOD2) relies on manganese. Thus, indirect inhibition of SOD1 can be achieved

225

through copper chelation43,44, while the mitochondrial SOD activity should remain intact.

226
227

First, we validated whether we could achieve SOD1 inhibition in cell culture using the copper

228

chelator ATN-224 (Figure S4D). We observed that most of SOD1 activity was inhibited after

229

twenty-four-hour treatment using 2.5-5 µM. As expected, copper chelation did not affect SOD2

230

activity. Inhibition of SOD1 resulted in increased sensitivity of KEAP1MUT cells to β-lapachone-

231

mediated cell death and DNA damage (Figure 4D and 4E). Of note, SOD1 inhibition had little to

232

no effect in KEAP1WT cells (Figure 4D). We also examined the protein levels and activity of

233

SOD1 across our panel of NSCLC cells to evaluate whether KEAP1MUT cells have higher

234

capacity to detoxify cytosolic superoxide (Figure S4E). KEAP1 mutant cells did not exhibit

235

significantly higher levels of SOD1, suggesting that inactivation of KEAP1 does not confer a

236

reinforced capacity to detoxify cytosolic superoxide radicals through SOD1 upregulation.

237
238

To confirm whether copper chelation sensitizes KEAP1MUT cells through SOD1 inhibition, A549

239

cells were engineered to express an Escherichia coli manganese-dependent superoxide

240

dismutase enzyme (SodA) to rescue SOD activity. Importantly, SodA expression significantly

241

rescued the effects of copper chelation on β-lapachone treatment (Figure 4F and 4G).

242

Altogether, these data demonstrate that inhibition of SOD1 selectively increases β-lapachone

243

efficacy in KEAP1MUT NSCLC cells.

244
245

Discussion

246

Aberrant NRF2 activation promotes resistance to therapeutics that rely on the production of

247

ROS, including multiple chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy. In this study, we find that

248

NRF2 activation also promotes resistance to the NQO1-activatable prodrug β-lapachone, which

249

relies on the generation of superoxide for its efficacy. While direct NRF2 inhibition could

250

potentially reverse this resistance, NRF2 inhibitors identified to date either lack specificity or

251

potency. Further, the effects of NRF2 whole-body inhibition as anti-tumor strategy remain

252

unclear, as NRF2 activity in necessary for normal functioning of immune cells45,46.

253
254

Consequently, we have evaluated whether inhibition of the cellular antioxidant systems can

255

reverse the resistance of NRF2 active cells to ROS. We find that inhibitors of the TXN-

256

dependent peroxide detoxification system and SOD1, but not glutathione or catalase depletion,

257

can reverse the resistance of KEAP1MUT cells to β-lapachone. Surprisingly, we find that

258

KEAP1MUT cells were highly resistant to auranofin compared to KEAP1WT cells, which raises a

259

concern about the toxicity of the required auranofin doses to healthy tissues. The resistance of

260

KEAP1MUT cells is likely explained by the redundancy of the thioredoxin- and glutathione-

261

dependent antioxidant systems, which can both detoxify H2O2 and protect from excessive

262

oxidation. Indeed, even at the highest doses of auranofin, KEAP1MUT cells exhibited no

263

peroxiredoxin oxidation in the absence of exogenous oxidants. This redundancy of the

264

antioxidant program, particularly in cancer cells, represents a major challenge47. Although

265

concomitant inhibition of the GSH and the TXN-dependent systems has been shown to abolish

266

such redundancy in vitro, this strategy appears to be highly toxic and potentially lethal in vivo.

267

Elias Arnér’s laboratory recently previously reported that combination of auranofin and BSO in

268

mice, at concentrations that are tolerable as single agents, was lethal after the first round of

269

administration48.

270
271

While previous studies demonstrated an important role for H2O2 in mediating β-lapachone

272

cytotoxicity, we uncovered a surprising role for SOD1 in the protection against cell death in

273

KEAP1MUT cells. The selectivity of SOD1 inhibition for KEAP1MUT cells may be a consequence of

274

the enhanced peroxide detoxification capacity of these cells, while KEAP1WT cells may be

275

equally sensitive to both peroxide and superoxide. Importantly, our results suggest that

276

antioxidant inhibition may sensitize NRF2/KEAP1 mutant cells to other ROS-generating

277

therapeutics to which these cells are generally resistant. Importantly, a recent study found that

278

SOD1 deletion or modulation of copper availability sensitized Jurkat cells to the superoxide

279

generating compound paraquat49. Interestingly, SOD1 inhibition alone could target NSCLC cells

280

in a study using A549 and H460 cells, which are KEAP1 mutant50. This study also found SOD1

281

inhibition was synergistic with glutathione depletion, suggesting that alternative combinations to

282

inhibit the antioxidant capacity of KEAP1 mutant cells may be possible.

Auranofin and ATN-224 join the growing list of agents that can sensitize cells to β-lapachone.

285

These agents converge on DNA damage and repair (PARP and XRCC1)32,39, NAD+ availability

286

(NAMPT)51, and ROS (GLS1 inhibition)52. Recently, more potent NQO1-activatable compounds,

287

including the deoxynyboquinones (DNQs) have shown equivalent efficacy to β-lapachone at 6-

288

fold lower dose22. Isobutyl-deoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) is being developed for clinical use53,

289

and lacks the issues with stability, solubility and red blood cell toxicity that β-lapachone

290

demonstrates. Our results suggest KEAP1MUT cells would be resistant to IB-DNQ as well, and

291

KEAP1/NRF2 mutation status should be considered in addition to NQO1 levels when predicting

292

in vivo response to these agents.

Stable cell line generation. Stable cell lines were generated via lentiviral transduction. For

473

lentivirus production, Lenti-X 293T cells (Clontech) were transfected at 90% confluence with

474

JetPRIME (Polyplus) or Polyethylenimine (PEI). Packaging plasmids pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr

475

(addgene # 8455) and pCMV-VSV-G (addgene #8454) were used. Cells were transduced for 6

476

hours by recombinant lentiviruses in growth media using polybrene (8 µg/ml). Twenty-four hours

477

after transduction, puromycin (1 µg/ml) was added to the growth medium for 72 hours to select

478

for infected cells.

479
480

Cell viability assays. NSCLC cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2,500-5,000

481

cells/well in a 200 µl final volume. The following day, the media was replaced with 150 µl of

482

fresh media containing the indicated concentrations of β-lapachone or vehicle (≤ 0.1% DMSO)

483

for two hours, after which media was replaced. Two hours after treatment, medium was

484

replaced by 200 µl fresh medium. Cell viability was assessed 48 hours after treatment with

485

CellTiter-Glo (Promega) or crystal violet staining. To stain surviving cells with crystal violet, cells

486

were washed in ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet

487

solution (0.1% Crystal Violet, 20% methanol), washed with H2O and dried overnight. Crystal

488

violet was solubilized in 10% acetic acid for 30 minutes and the OD600 was measured. Relative

489

cell number was normalized to vehicle treated cells.

490

For experiments using the copper chelator ATN-224, cells were pre-treated with 1-5 µM of ATN-

491

224 for 24 hours prior β-lapachone treatment. To ensure that no copper was added back with

492

the media when cells were treated with β-lapachone, additional ATN-224 containing medium

493

was prepared the day before β-lapachone treatment and stored at 4°C. After 24 hours, β-

494

lapachone was prepared in ATN-224 containing medium and 150 µl were dispensed in each

495

well. Similarly, cells were pre-treated for 24 hours with 100-200 µM of BSO prior β-lapachone

496

exposure, which was prepared in BSO containing media to prevent the recovery of glutathione.

497

Auranofin was added to the media in combination with β-lapachone for 2 hours.

Protein extraction and Immunoblotting. Lysates were prepared in RIPA lysis buffer (20 mM

500

Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium

501

deoxycholate) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. To assess total/gamma-H2A.X

502

levels in whole cell lysates, cells were lysed in boiling 1% w/v SDS RIPA lysis buffer

503

supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at

504

70-90% confluence. After drug treatment (β-lapachone +/- ATN-224 or auranofin) cells were

505

washed in PBS and 300 µl of pre-warmed lysis buffer (90°C) was directly added to the wells.

506

Cell lysates were transferred to a microcentrifuge tubes, incubated at 90°C for 5 minutes,

507

followed by sonication to shred the DNA in a water bath sonicator (Diagenode). Samples were

508

centrifuged at 13,000 x rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C to precipitate the insoluble fraction. The

509

supernatant was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube. Alternatively, total/gamma-H2A.X levels

510

were monitored in nuclear extracts (see protocol below). Cell lysates were mixed with 6X

511

sample buffer containing β-ME and separated by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris

512

gels (Invitrogen), followed by transfer to 0.45µm Nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare).

513

The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T, followed by immunoblotting.

514
515

Nuclear isolation. Cells were plated in 6-cm dishes at 70-90% confluence (5x105 cells/well).

516

The following day, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, collected in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS,

517

transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 × rpm for 1 min

518

at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 µl of ice-cold of the low-salt buffer A (10 mM

519

HEPES/KOH pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA and protease/phosphatase

520

inhibitors). After incubation for 10 minutes on ice, 10 µl of 10% NP-40 was added and cells were

lysed by gently vortexing. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 seconds at 13,200 rpm. The

522

supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction while the pellet containing the cell nuclei

523

was washed 4 times in 400 µl buffer A. Cell nuclei was lysed in 100µl high-salt buffer B (20mM

524

HEPES/KOH pH7.9, 400mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA and protease/phosphatase

525

inhibitors). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 4°C for 15 minutes at 13,200 rpm.

526

The supernatant representing the nuclear fraction was collected and protein concentration of

527

both fractions was determined using the DC protein assay (Biorad). Cytosolic and nuclear

528

fractions were further diluted to the desired protein concentration using the corresponding lysis

529

buffers. One volume of 5X sample SDS loading buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl [pH 6.8], 10% [v/v] SDS,

530

40% [v/v] glycerol, and 0.1% [w/v] bromophenol blue, 15% [v/v] β-mercaptoethanol) was added

531

to 4 volumes of the lysate and subjected to SDS-PAGE.

532
533

In-gel SOD activity assay. Cells were plated in 35 mm diameter cell culture dishes at a density

534

of 3.5 x 105 if assayed the following day or 3.5 x 105 cells/well if 24 hours of ATN-224 pre-

535

treatment was required. Cells were collected by scraping with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for

536

30 min in 100 µl of SOD lysis buffer (8.96 mM Na2HPO4, 0.96 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1% Triton X-100,

5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaCl, 10 % Glycerol). Samples were centrifuged for 15

538

minutes at 13,000 x rpm at 4°C, and supernatant transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Protein

539

concentration was determined using the DC protein Assay (Biorad). Protein samples were

540

diluted to 0.7-1 µg/µl using the SOD lysis buffer and 1/5th volume of 5x native loading dye [0.31

541

M Tris pH 6.8, 0.05% bromophenol blue (w/v), 50% glycerol (v/v)]. Samples were subjected to

542

native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%) at 90V for 2 hours at 4°C in a buffer containing

543

25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine. The gel was stained in SOD staining solution (0.22 M K2HPO4,

544

0.02 M KH2PO4, 1% [w/v] Riboflavin, 1.3% [w/v] Nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.1% TEMED) in the

545

dark for 1 hour, after which the gel was washed in dH2O and exposed to light until developed to

546

dark blue/black (1 hour approximately). Achromatic bands correspond to SOD1 and SOD2.

547
548

Reactive oxygen species measurement. Reactive oxygen species were measured using the

549

CellROX green reagent (Thermofisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In short,

550

cells were plated in 24-well plates at 70% confluence. The following day, cells were treated with

551

the indicated concentrations of β-lapachone in a 400 µl/well final volume for 30 minutes at 37°C.

552

CellROX green reagent was added to a final concentration of 5 µM to the cells without replacing

553

the media, and incubated for additional 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were washed in PBS,

554

trypsinized and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 20

555

seconds at 13,000 x rpm, and resuspended in 300 µl of ice-cold PBS. The Green fluorescence

556

of dye-loaded cells was determined by flow cytometry using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer

557

(BD Biosciences) and the acquisition software CellQuest Pro. The mean fluorescence intensity

558

of 10,000 discrete events was calculated for each sample.

559
560

Glutathione measurement. H1944 and HCC15 cells were seeded on flat, round bottomed 96-

561

well plates at a density of 1x104 cells/well. The following day, media was replaced with media

562

containing 100-200 µM of BSO or fresh media (negative control). The following day, the GSH-

563

Glo™ Glutathione Assay (Promega, Cat# V6911) was used to measure the intracellular reduced

564

glutathione pool (GSH). Data were normalized by percentage relative to the control non-treated

565

sample.

566
567

Redox western blotting. The protocol for determining the ratio of reduced and oxidized

568

peroxiredoxin 1 and 3 was adapted from Prof. Mark Hampton’s lab57. One-day prior to the

569

assay, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 70-90% confluence (~5x105 cells/well). The

570

following day, cell culture media was replaced with 1ml of media containing 1, 3 or 5 µM of

571

auranofin or fresh medium. Final DMSO concentration was 0.013% (V/V). Two hours after

572

treatment, media was aspirated and cells were gently washed with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. 1

573

mg/ml of bovine catalase was added to the alkylation buffer (40mM HEPES, 50mM NaCl, 1mM

574

EGTA, complete protease inhibitors, pH 7.4) 30 minutes prior collection. Immediately prior

575

sample collection, 200 mM of N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) were added to the alkylation buffer and

576

the lysis buffer was warmed to 42°C for 1-2 minutes to dissolve the NEM. To lyse the cells, 200

577

µl of alkylation buffer were dispensed in each well, followed by 10 min incubation at room

578

temperature. A solution of 10% CHAPS was added to the lysates to a final concentration of 1%

579

CHAPS (20 µl/sample). Cell lysates were transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, samples

580

were vortex and incubated on ice for further 30 minutes, followed by 15 minutes centrifugation

581

at 13,000 x rpm, 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.

582

These redox western samples were mixed with a 4X non-reducing buffer prior to separation by

583

SDS-Page.

584
585

Analysis of NQO1 mRNA expression in patient samples. Patient normal lung, LuAD and

586

LuSC data mRNA data was obtained by combining the data available in cBioportal and the

587

MethHC databases. Patient LuAD and LuAD data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),

588

with associated KEAP1 mutation status (Illumina HM450 Beadchip), was obtained from

589

cBioPortal58,59. Patient IDs were matched with the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)

590

via the MethHC database60, and expression of NQO1 in normal lung tissue data was included in

591

the study.
