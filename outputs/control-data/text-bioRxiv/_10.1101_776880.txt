Abstract

24
25

Penicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (PSSA) may occasionally be

26

encountered as a cause of complicated S. aureus infection, such as endocarditis

27

or bloodstream infections. Clinicians may choose to treat these patients with

28

penicillin over a semi-synthetic penicillin derivative, such as flucloxacillin or

29

oxacillin, due to a favourable Pk/Pd profile. In this study, we prospectively

30

evaluated the penicillin disc (1-IU) method for detection of blaZ, with

31

interpretation of the penicillin edge according to EUCAST recommendations.

32

472 PSSA isolates were collected between September 2014 to December 2015

33

from three clinical microbiology laboratories in Queensland, Australia. Initial

34

antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the Vitek 2 system. Real-

35

time PCR for blaZ was performed following phenotypic testing with the 1-IU

36

penicillin disc and the PCR used as the gold standard for detection of

37

penicillinase. The prevalence of blaZ amongst the isolates was 7%. The

38

sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of

39

the penicillin disc method was 97%, 95%, 61% and 100% when compared to

40

blaZ PCR. In summary, the penicillin disc zone size and edge interpretation is a

41

reliable method for detection of blaZ in S. aureus isolates that otherwise test

42

susceptible to penicillin by Vitek 2 AST.

Introduction

44

Penicillin is commonly used to treat patients with complicated infections with

45

invasive penicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (PSSA) infections.(1) Key

46

advantages of penicillin treatment include a lower MIC distribution compared with

47

other beta-lactam agents active against S. aureus, as well as the ability to achieve

48

higher free non-protein-bound plasma drug concentrations.(1)

49

recently updated American Heart Association guidelines on infective endocarditis

50

do not recommend the use of penicillin for PSSA endocarditis.(2) This decision is

51

primarily based on concerns raised over the ability of laboratory methods to

52

accurately detect certain forms of penicillin resistance in S. aureus; specifically,

53

current evidence indicates that screening methods for the blaZ penicillinase gene

54

are insensitive.(2)

However, the

55
56

Two key mechanisms are responsible for resistance to penicillin in staphylococci;

57

the blaZ gene which encodes for penicillinase, a serine beta-lactamase which

58

hydrolyses the β-lactam ring resulting in the production of penicilloic acid, and the

59

mecA gene which encodes for penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2A.(3, 4) While the

60

presence of mecA can readily and accurately be detected through the use of the

61

cefoxitin disk diffusion test, there are well-recognized difficulties with detection of

62

blaZ.(5)

63

method for penicillinase detection amongst S. aureus, has been shown to produce

64

false negative results.(6-10) Molecular methods (including PCR) may be more be

65

accurate, but are typically too expensive and slow compared to the phenotypic

The nitrocefin hydrolysis test, previously a widely used phenotypic

66

methods to be a suitable alternative for routine use. Molecular assays may also be

67

impeded by the nucleotide variations in sequence targets associated with the

68

different blaZ types.(10) At present, both CLSI and EUCAST recommend

69

phenotypic testing via a penicillin disc.(11) By utilizing the penicillin disc method,

70

isolates harbouring blaZ may still appear sensitive according to the zone size, but

71

blaZ presence may be identified by closer inspection of the zone edge, and is

72

indicated by the appearance of a straight edge or cliff. Although being the current

73

recommended method, limited prospective data is available to confirm the validity

74

of penicillin disc detection of blaZ in clinical microbiology laboratories. In fact,

75

experiences at our laboratory suggest that scientists, particularly those

76

infrequently performing the method, struggle to appropriately interpret the zone

77

edges.

78
79

The study was designed to address two aims. The first aim was to use PCR to

80

examine the prevalence of the blaZ beta-lactamase amongst PSSA isolates across

81

3 microbiology laboratories in Queensland. The second aim was to prospectively

82

evaluate the 1 IU penicillin disc test for detection of penicillinase in PSSA isolates

83

compared to the nitrocefin test, using real-time PCR for blaZ as the gold standard.

Methods

85
86

Overview

87

This project was performed in a clinical microbiology laboratory in the city of

88

Townsville, located in the state of Queensland, Australia. From September 2014

89

to December 2015, isolates (total = 472) were prospectively collected for the

90

study from 3 laboratories (Townsville Hospital, Gold Coast Hospital, Princess

91

Alexandra Hospital).

92
93

For isolates collected in Townsville (n = 207), the interpretation and report of the

94

penicillin zone size and edge was performed by scientific staff as part of the

95

routine standard operating procedure; note that this zone test was the sole

96

method used for routine detection of blaZ when the Vitek 2 demonstrated

97

penicillin susceptibility. Isolates were then stored and later batch-tested as part

98

of the research study using the nitrocefin test and blaZ PCR and retested using

99

the penicillin disc test by the investigators (supervising scientist and microbiology

100

registrar). Isolates collected in the Gold Coast Hospital (n = 65) and Princess

101

Alexandra Hospital (n = 200) laboratories were stored and later transferred and

102

batch-tested as above (nitrocefin, blaZ PCR and penicillin disc tests) by the

103

investigators at the Townsville laboratory. It should be noted that all penicillin

104

disc tests were performed independently of and without knowledge of the

105

nitrocefin or blaZ PCR test results. Where isolates demonstrated discrepant

106

results between blaZ PCR and the penicillin disc test or nitrocefin results, the

107

isolate was repeated by all 3 tests and interpreted by two investigators blinded to

108

each other’s interpretation.

109
110

S. aureus identification and susceptibility testing

111

Identification of S. aureus was performed at all three laboratories via a

112

combination of latex agglutination for coagulase activity, presence of DNase

113

(DNase test agar, Oxoid, Thermo Fisher Scientific), Vitek 2 (bioMerrieux)

114

identification and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (bioMerrieux). All S. aureus

115

isolates underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing, performed with the Vitek 2

116

automated broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) system,

117

with susceptibility interpreted against EUCAST criteria.(11) Only isolates with

118

penicillin MICs ≤ 0.125 μg/ml (EUCAST penicillin breakpoint) were included in

119

the study.

120
121

Penicillin disc test

122

A 0.5 MacFarland suspension was made from a single colony of S. aureus for

123

Kirby Bauer disc diffusion test on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA, bioMerrieux), with a

124

30 μg cefoxitin disc and 1 μg penicillin disc incubated at 35 degrees Celsius in

125

atmospheric oxygen for 24 hours. Zone sizes were measured and interpreted

126

according to EUCAST criteria. Isolates with a zone < 26 mm, or with a sharp

127

zone edge were considered resistant.(11)

130

Phenotypic beta-lactamase activity was performed on all isolates using nitrocefin

131

(SR12C; Oxoid) by the paper disc spot method, according to the manufacturer’s

132

instructions. A sweep of colonies were taken from the edge of the cefoxitin disc,

133

which was incubated for 24 hours at 35 degrees Celsius, and applied to the

134

nitrocefin impregnated region. A change in colour of the paper from yellow to red

135

indicated a positive result and this was read after 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1

136

hour.

137
138

blaZ PCR

139

Bacterial DNA was extracted from pure colonies growing on Columbia horse

140

blood agar by the boiling lysis method as follows. Two to three colonies of S.

141

aureus were suspended in 0.5ml of sterile demineralised water and immersed in

142

a water bath at 100 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes. After this, the suspension

143

was centrifuged at 15000 x g for 30 seconds. 50 µl of supernatant was stored at -

144

80 degrees Celsius, in preparation for performing nucleic acid amplification

145

testing (NAAT).

146
147

Real-time PCR amplification of the blaZ gene was performed with the previously

148

described primers and Taqman probe by Pereira, et al. (10), with some

149

modifications. Briefly, the reaction mix contained 0.5 µM forward primer (5’-GCT

150

TTA GAA CTT ATT GAG GCT TCA-3’), 0.5 µM reverse primer (5’-CCA CCG

151

ATY TCK TTT ATA ATT T-3’), 0.2 µM Taqman probe (5’-FAM-AGT GAT AAT

153

QuantiTect Probe PCR buffer mix (Qiagen, Australia) and 5 µl of nucleic acid

154

extract in a total volume of 25 µl per test. The primers and probe were sourced

155

from Integrated DNA Technologies. Amplification was performed using

156

RotorgeneQ real-time thermocyclers (Qiagen, Australia), with reactions run under

157

the following conditions: 95 oC for 10 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95 oC for

158

15 seconds and 60 oC for 60 seconds. Fluorescent probe signals were read

159

during the 60 second extension step of the cycling program.

160
161

Statistical analysis

162

All statistical analysis was performed using R (R Project for Statistical

163

Computing, http://www.r-project.org/). Graphs were created though the ggplot2

164

package with the exception of the receiver operator curve for zone size and blaZ

165

detection, which was created through the pROC package.(12) Cohen’s Kappa

166

score was used to determine the agreement between scientific staff and

167

investigators for interpretation of the penicillin zone edge for the isolates

168

collected in Townsville. McNemar’s test was performed to compare sensitivity

169

and specificity, whereas weighted generalized scores were performed to

170

compare positive and negative predictive values for paired isolates (13, 14). A p-

171

value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

173
174

The overall prevalence rate of blaZ amongst the combined 472 PSSA isolates

175

was 7.3% (n = 34, 95% confidence interval 5.3% - 10.1%) according to the blaZ

176

PCR results. This result was similar amongst the 207 isolates from the

177

Townsville Hospital laboratory (prevalence = 6.8%, 95% CI 4.0 - 11.0%), the 65

178

isolates from the Gold Coast Hospital laboratory (10.8%, 95% CI 0.8% - 13.2%)

179

and the 200 isolates from the PA Hospital laboratory (6.5%, 95% CI 3.8% -

180

10.6%).

181
182

Table 1 demonstrates the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values calculated

183

for the penicillin disc test and nitrocefin test for blaZ detection (using the blaz PCR

184

as the gold standard). In comparison to the penicillin disc test, nitrocefin performed

185

poorly at detecting blaZ amongst PSSA isolates. The sensitivity of nitrocefin (15%,

186

95% CI 5 – 31%) was lower than the penicillin disc test (97%, 95% CI 85 – 100%)

187

for detection of blaZ, with the difference in sensitivity between the penicillin disc

188

test and nitrocefin found to be statistically significant (p < 0.01). Despite the low

189

prevalence rate of blaZ amongst the isolates, a statistically significant difference

190

between the negative predictive value (NPV) of nitrocefin and the penicillin disc

191

test was detected (94% versus 100%; p <0.01)

196

of zone size for detection of blaZ and is demonstrated in Supplementary Table 2.

197

For isolates with a Vitek 2 MIC of ≤ 0.03 μg/ml, blaZ was detected in 4/83

198

isolates, compared to 8/275 and 22/114 with MICs of 0.06 μg/ml and 0.12 μg/ml

respectively.

201

Two isolates were found to have penicillin zone sizes less than 26mm (EUCAST

203

populations of growth within an outer zone of inhibition to the penicillin disc that

204

measured greater than 26 mm. The edge of the outer zone appeared fuzzy,

205

indicating absence of beta-lactamase. In addition, both isolates (inner and outer

206

populations) tested negative for penicillinase activity by nitrocefin.

population colonies growing inside the outer zone were confirmed to be S. aureus

Overall, 25 isolates produced initial discordant phenotypic results when compared

Discussion

227
228

In this study, we investigated beta-lactamase detection amongst PSSA isolates

229

in a routine clinical microbiology laboratory following the recent introduction of the

230

penicillin disc test to replace the nitrocefin test. The results of our study, along

231

with other recently reported studies, confirm that the penicillin disc test (using

232

EUCAST methodology) is a reliable predictor of phenotypic activity of blaZ.(8-10)

233

Notably, only 1 isolate that was positive for blaZ by PCR was not detected by the

234

penicillin disc test. This isolate was tested by scientists as part of routine

235

practice and was incorrectly reported as susceptible to penicillin. The isolate was

236

subsequently confirmed as penicillin resistant by the investigators when the test

237

was repeated and the discrepancy was considered to be caused by human error,

238

rather than a problem with the penicillin disc test. Consistent with previous

239

studies, we also found the nitrocefin test to be highly insensitive and re-enforces

240

the decision of our local laboratories to move away from the nitrocefin test as per

241

the updated EUCAST recommendations.(6, 8, 9)

242
243

Overall the prevalence rate of blaZ detected in PSSA from the three laboratories

244

was 7%. This rate is lower than from recently reported SAB data in 2013, in the

245

Australian setting, where 332 (20.4%) isolates initially tested susceptible to

246

penicillin from 1342 episodes of MSSA bacteraemias and beta-lactamase was

247

detected in 69 (20.8%) of the PSSA isolates.(15) These rates support the

248

recommendation made by EUCAST to screen for blaZ amongst PSSA in our

12

249

region prior to reporting isolates as susceptible to penicillin.(11) Although there

250

are theoretical advantages to using penicillin over other agents for PSSA

251

infections, the use of penicillin for this indication needs to be considered against

252

the capacity of the laboratory to detect blaZ. Importantly, the NPV of the

253

penicillin disc test was 99% when performed by the routine scientists and 100%

254

by the investigators. These high NPVs suggest that if clinicians were to treat

255

patients with penicillin on the basis of a negative penicillin disc test result then

256

the use of use penicillin would be appropriate in at least 99% of cases. In

257

contrast, the significantly lower NPV of the nitrocefin test (94%, p < 0.01) would

258

result in approximately 6% of patients (infected with blaZ-harbouring strains)

259

inappropriately receiving penicillin treatment. Although the positive predictive

260

value (PPV) of the disc test was lower than the nitrocefin method (76% vs 100%),

261

this issue (reporting of false resistance) was not considered a major limitation of

262

the disc test as it would only limit treatment options, rather than leading to

263

incorrect treatment. Also, clinicians may otherwise choose to use flucloxacillin

264

over penicillin regardless of the laboratory reporting penicillin as susceptible.(16)

265

As such, it is our opinion that the potential benefit of the PPV of nitrocefin should

266

not be relied upon when laboratories make a decision in regards to the choice of

267

test for blaZ detection.

268
269
270

An unusual finding in this study was the identification of 2 subpopulations of

271

MRSA that were blaZ negative. Heterogenous expression of methicillin

13

272

resistance was able to be identified by induction of sub-populations expressing

273

resistance through prolonged beta-lactam exposure using penicillin discs. A

274

likely explanation for this is the presence of two distinct S. aureus populations

275

(hetero-resistance), one carrying the mecA gene and one without, but with both

276

populations negative for blaZ. It is possible that mecA expression was altered in

277

the absence of blaZ given that mecA induction occurs at a much slower rate than

278

that of blaZ induction, with a recent study demonstrating that expression of mecA

279

relies upon an intact blaZ system.(17) Optimal expression of methicillin

280

resistance, occurring when both regulatory systems are present, is due to the

281

formation of BlaI:MecI heterodimers that weakly bind to the mecA operon and are

282

then more susceptible to BlaR1 preoteolysis and inactivation, thereby resulting in

283

transcription of mecA.(17)

284
285

Although our study demonstrated a reliable method for phenotypic detection of

286

beta-lactamase in PSSA isolates there are some limitations.

287

exclude that blaZ variants may not have been detected by the primers and probe

288

used in this study. Similarly, we did not perform any sequencing of the real-time

289

PCR products to confirm the specificity of the assay. In addition, many laboratories

290

only perform beta-lactamase testing in PSSA on isolates from blood culture, or

291

sterile sites, where a long phase of intravenous and/or oral antibiotics may be

292

required. Therefore, for laboratories that perform the test on an ad-hoc basis,

293

accurately discerning the edge of the penicillin disc may prove more challenging.

294

This may explain why the specificity result was shown to be lower for scientists,

Firstly, we cannot

295

than for the investigators (93% versus 97%).

This point is reinforced in the

296

EUCAST guidelines for clinical breakpoints.(11) A clear instruction is given to err

297

on the side of caution and to report isolates as resistant if the result of the test is

298

not clear to the observer.(11)

299
300

In summary, for clinicians to confidently use penicillin for the treatment of PSSA,

301

we recommend laboratories consider the penicillin disc test over nitrocefin.

302

Notwithstanding this, laboratories performing the penicillin disc test on an ad-hoc

303

basis run the risk of reduced sensitivity and specificity given interpretation of the

304

disc edge may be dependent on the experience of the scientist.
