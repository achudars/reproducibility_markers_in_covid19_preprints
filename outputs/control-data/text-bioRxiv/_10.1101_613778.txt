Abstract
Vocal communication accounts for dominantly percentage within animal species.
The information of vocal samples contains not only the amplitude of objects, but also
the emotional states behind it. However, to extract the emotion state behind the sound
remains controversial. Here we introduce an artificial network method, the Back
Propagation Neural Network, BPNN, to classify the emotional states behind the
sound. The results disclosed the behaviour categories, including alarm, flight, begging
and singing which has been successfully classified. This artificial intelligence
classification may aid us to distinguish the ecological categories via animal vocal
communication and to discover its significance of evolution and nature.
Key words: vocal communication, raven, artificial intelligence, Back Propagation
Neural Network, emotional states.
Background
The sound is one of universal phenomenon, which does not only exist in
numerous nature phenomenon [1-3], but also appear in animal communication in
species or across species [4, 5]. From the perspective of physics, the sound is
generated by the amplitude of object, which determines the frequency and intensity
[6-8]. According to evolution, the ability of adaption and survival skills of species had
been constructed and strengthened for surviving, for example: track the life source,
avoid the harmful events and defend the territory [9, 10].
With respecting the animal communication, there are three domain categories,
sound, behaviour and the order [11-14]. The pronunciation process of animal depends
on a series of muscles interaction, including breathing muscles, mouth muscles and
throat muscles and the amplitude of vocal cord [15, 16]. Vocal communication
accounts for dominant percentage in species [17, 18]. Sound response on the
stimulation is the best indicator of sender’s emotional state under the specific
circumstances, such as nervousness, sadness, happiness, repulsiveness, angriness and
afraid [19, 20].
Interestingly, the raven, an intelligent avian, has been used in many specific mind
and brain studies for decades [21-23]. For example, the raven’s memory predict future
[24], sequence tool used to get the award [25], the awareness of density of article[26],
and so on. Ravens’ call often appears frequently during their foraging[27], defend the
territory[28], rutting and mating[29], infant parenting[30]. Even though we can hear
various different callings, however, to classify the emotional states behind the sound
remains unclear. Here are four behaviour validated related calls of raven are
hypothesized to be directly different among acoustic parameters, providing cues to

emotional category recognition. Therefore, we use the method, termed as “Back
Propagation Neural Network, BPNN”, to disclose the emotion behind the sound. This
may be helpful to us to understand each other better, not only in same species, but
also across species.
Method
Data Source
Total 851 sound samples of raven have been downloaded from the website
(https://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Corvus-corax ) and their detail information
sorted into excel file, totally 11 variables included: “Common name, scientific name,
recording duration, recording person, date and time of recording, country, location,
altitude, tweet type, behaviour marker, audio file classification number”. The variable
“type” described the behaviour profiles according to the current situation, including
alarm, fighting, flying, begging, and singing. Furthermore, the “Remarks” listed the
detail raven’s behaviours. Aim to reduce the noise impact and enhance the
discrimination effect, the sound samples, which contain more than 2 raven’s sounds,
have been excluded. Four different categories of sound samples (alarm, singing,
fighting and begging) have been selected. Consequently, there were only 100 sound
samples recruited in the final data analysis.
Acoustic Parameters Extraction
Here we use the MATLAB script to extract the acoustic parameters [31, 32].
Including: (1) Mean fo(Hz), (2) Maximum fo(Hz), (3) Minimum fo(Hz), (4) Range
fo(Hz), (5) Start fo(Hz), (6) End fo(Hz), (7) fo at the half of call duration (mid fo Hz),
(8) slope from fo start of the call to the fo maximum (slope S-M; Hz/s), (9) Slope
from maximum fo to the end of the call (Slope M-E; Hz/s), (10) Inflection rate
(number of frequency changes/s), (11) Harmonicity (HNR, dB), (12) Jitter (the
absolute ; fo difference between consecutive fo measurements/ the average period),
(13) fo variation (sum of all fo changes measured/ call duration, Hz), (14) amplitude
range (maximum dB-minimum dB).
Data Analysis
According to the raven’s call recorded under the different circumstances, the
biological meanings may be presented differently. Therefore, we selected Back
Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) method [33-35]. A typical BPNN consists of
the input layer, hidden layer and output layer (Figure 1).

By meaning of BPNN method, the biological meanings of raven’s call have been
classified. Firstly, we have selected the training samples: 14 sound parameters were
used. We tested first 100 sound samples. Namely, all data imported training dataset.
Secondly, pre-processing: Due to realistic complexity, we used the standard process
of deviation normalization (x. std. = (x-min) / (max-min)) to perform the better neural

network and to reduce the negative effect of over fit. The new data was constructed
via dimensionless processing. Thirdly, primary parameter selection: The number of
input layer units was 14. There was only one output layer neuron. Then, the number
of hidden layer neurons was 12. Details please see Figure 2.

Figure 2. Neural Network Pattern
The unique purpose of BPNN construction is to classify. Double transfer sigmoid
function and linear were used. The results were presented well when used “tansig”
function in the input layer-hidden layer and linear function in the hidden layer-output
layer. Furthermore, the “trainlm” method (combined gradient descent method with
Newton method) was used for training, which terminated when achieved the best
effect. The details of training performance process please see Figure 3.

Figure 3. Training Process
Fourth, Validation the prediction effect: the training network was used to predict the
types of raven calls, to detect the prediction and promotion ability of the network, and
to get the classification of network simulation and actual classification. The detail
comparison results please see figure 4.

The overall trend of the predicted value was close to the actual value. It can be
inferred that the prediction of the model is more accurate, while it has a certain
reference value. The results disclosed that the average absolute error and the average
relative error of the actual classification and the predicted classification were 1.0e-09
and 1.0e-10, respectively.
Discussion
The sound is the best indicator to reflect the property of the object [36, 37]. From
the physical perspective, the size of sound depends on the frequency of object, and the
pitch of sound depends on the amplitude of object [38, 39].
With respect to the animal communication, the pronunciation is not only
depending on a series of pronounced organ coordination work [40-42], but also
depending on the control of central nervous system [43]. The animals have been
adapted to the environment after a long time evolution process via a series of
successful constructed conditional reflexes [44]. It is obvious that the emotional
information maybe hide behind the vocal communication.
The raven is recognized as the most intelligent avian [45, 46]. It was being used in
mind, sequenced tool used test, awareness, learning and memory researches. More
interestingly, Markus et al distinguished the gender and age of raven [47], and
reported that ravens can predict future via their memory [24].
There are four behaviour categories of raven’s call, including alarm, begging,
flighting and singing. It is necessary to distinguish the specific behaviouristic
category. Thanks to BPNN method, their behaviour categories have been classified
successfully.
The abundance information is contained within the sound in animal
communication. There is not only the amplitude information of object, but also

embedded emotional state. For example, professional police can distinguish the
criminal suspects via sophisticated conservation due to their unstable irregular
speaking [48]; experienced hunter can determine the degree of hunger of animal [49].
To distinguish the emotional state behind the sound is of great significance.
Through the emotion information behind the ravens’ sound, we can get better
understanding of their biological meanings. For instance, the alarm call often occurs
on the occasion of dangerous events approaching, it is good for avoiding the harmful
events and surviving [50, 51]. The flight call occurs on the situation of fighting
process; the failure subject presents submission to dominant subject to avoid the
further damage on its body or relationship [52, 53]. Moreover, the begging call
happens when sub-dominant subject paying / begging for the life sources, such as the
food, resting place etc [54, 55]. As for the singing; this may arise on the situation of
pleasant animal communication, as for the specific motivation remains controversial.
Taken together, this artificial network could be helpful of trying to distinguish the
behaviour categories of different raven’s sounds. It can strengthen our understanding
on their biological and evolution meanings.
Conclusion
Taken together, we herewith disclose the method of BPNN could be the promising
candidate to classify the category of raven’s call. Furthermore, this may help us to
investigate more in-depth of neurobiology of raven’s mind.
