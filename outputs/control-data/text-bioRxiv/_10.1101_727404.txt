Abstract
The placenta promotes fetal growth through nutrient transfer and selective barrier systems. An optimally developed placenta can
adapt to changes in the pregnancy environment, buffering the fetus from adverse exposures. We hypothesised that the placenta
adapts differently to suboptimal maternal diets, evidenced by changes in placental morphology, developmental markers, and key
transport systems. Mice were fed a control diet (CON) during pregnancy, or undernourished (UN) by 30% of control intake from
gestational day (GD)5.5-18.5, or fed 60% high fat diet (HF) eight weeks before and during pregnancy. At GD18.5, placental
morphometry, development, and transport were assessed. Junctional and labyrinthine areas of UN and HF placentae were smaller
than CON by >10%. Fetal blood space area and fetal blood space:fetal weight ratios were reduced in HF vs. CON and UN.
Trophoblast giant cell marker Ctsq mRNA expression was lower in UN vs. HF, and expression of glycogen cell markers Cx31.1
and Pcdh12 was lower in HF vs. UN. Efflux transporter Abcb1a mRNA expression was lower in HF vs. UN, and Abcg2 expression
was lower in UN vs. HF. mRNA expression of fatty acid binding protein Fabppm was higher in UN vs. CON and HF. mRNA and
protein levels of the lipid transporter FAT/CD36 were lower in UN, and FATP4 protein levels were lower in HF vs. UN. UN
placentae appear less mature with aberrant transport. HF placentae adapt to excessive nutrient supply. Understanding placental
adaptations to common nutritional adversities may reveal mechanisms underlying the developmental origins of later disease.

Introduction
The placenta is an active participant in pregnancy, acting as a
conduit between the mother and fetus. In this capacity, it can
promote fetal growth through nutrient and oxygen transfer1-3, and
minimise adverse exposures from reaching the fetus via efflux
transporters and other barrier systems4. When its function is
optimal, the placenta can adapt to changes in the pregnancy
environment and buffer the fetus from adverse exposures1,5. But
if the placenta’s ability to respond to environmental stimuli is
compromised, perhaps due to altered placental development
and/or function, adaptation may be insufficient or absent, and fetal
growth and development may be adversely affected1,5. Poor fetal
growth is problematic: it is associated with suboptimal growth
trajectories in early life and increased risk for chronic diseases
long-term6,7. Yet, it remains unclear how the placenta adapts to
altered pregnancy environments in a manner that could shape fetal
growth and possibly underlie early origins of later disease.
In order for the placenta to function optimally, it first needs to
develop appropriately. Key aspects of placental development
include differentiation of cell types and placental structures8,
which are involved initially in the establishment and maintenance

of pregnancy, and later in nutrient and gas exchange between
mother and fetus. Placental morphology is exquisitely regulated
by molecular events, with some of the best studied placental
differentiation and development markers identified in the
trophoblast lineage in the mouse placenta8-10. In the junctional
zone (JZ), the major endocrine layer of the mouse placenta, the
trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) (in part identified by expression of
the gene Prl3b1) are differentiated cells that maintain contact with
the maternal environment throughout development11 and are
critical for many maternal adaptations during pregnancy. This
includes regulation of blood flow and synthesis of placental
lactogen hormones12. Spongiotrophoblast cells (identified by
expression of Tpbpa), situated between TGCs and the inner
labyrinth layer, make up the JZ of the mouse placenta, providing
structural support for the growth of the labyrinthine villi and limit
fetal endothelium overgrowth13. Within the spongiotrophoblast
layer, glycogen trophoblast cells (in part identified by expression
of Cx31.1 and Pcdh12) develop and migrate into the decidua from
mid gestation and assemble around spiral arteries to provide
endocrine and/or structural support to exchange structures9,14,15.
Substantial expansion of these glycogen cells16 between E14.518.5 results in a significant increase in glucose storage for the

fetus, likely contributing to fetal growth in late gestation and
providing a source of energy for the fetus during delivery14,16,17.
In the labyrinth zone, the major murine placental exchange layer,
there exists a layer of sinusoidal giant cells (with some level of
exchange function11, identified by Prl3b1 and Ctsq gene
expression), and two layers of syncytiotrophoblast that are
connected by gap junctions18. When genes regulating placental
differentiation and development are absent or nonfunctional10,12,19, placental development is impeded, and fetal
development can be altered20-22.

hypothesised that the placenta could adapt differently to maternal
UN and HF diets, through changes in its development and
function, and these adaptations would explain why offspring of
UN and HF mothers grow differently in utero, and could reveal
mechanisms underpinning developmental origins of later disease.
To address this, we assessed select placental developmental
markers, and ABC and fatty acid transporters at the end of
pregnancy in dams fed a normal diet, UN, or fed a HF diet, and
determined the effects of these diets on maternal metabolism and
fetal growth.

Secondary to structure, the selective permeability of the placenta
is critical to fetal growth and development1. The fetus is reliant on
transport of nutrients, particularly glucose, amino acids, and fatty
acids, via the placenta through nutrient transporters and blood
flow regulation2,23. Fatty acids are particularly important for fetal
brain development, cellular signalling24, and adipose tissue
expansion, and their transfer to the fetus increases with advancing
gestation, such that peak adipose deposition occurs at term25.
Fatty acids are shuttled across the placenta typically down a
maternal-fetal concentration gradient via membrane fatty acid
transport proteins (FATPs), CD36, and fatty acid binding protein
plasma membrane (FABP-pm)26-28. Additionally, throughout
pregnancy, placental efflux transporters (namely ATB-binding
cassette transporters, or ABC transporters) are critical for
removing waste and limit the accumulation of maternally-derived
exogenous substrates in the syncytiotrophoblast barrier, thereby
serving to protect the fetus against factors in the maternal
circulation4,29. They do this by transferring endogenous substrates
from the cytosol to the extracellular space, or from one side of a
barrier to another30. Placental P-glycoprotein (P-gp, encoded by
the ABCB1 gene) and breast cancer related protein (BCRP,
ABCG2) are two major ABC transporters in the placenta and show
opposing expression profiles across human gestation: ABCB1
mRNA and P-gp protein levels are high in first trimester,
decreasing towards term31, whilst BCRP protein levels increase
towards term, with mRNA levels not changing across
gestation32,33. Some ABC transporters are critical for lipid
transport, and many are sensitive to the effects of lipids, which
appear to influence ABC transporter activity34, although these
relationships are poorly defined in pregnancy. These selective
barrier functions of the placenta have been described in isolation
in normal pregnancy33,35-38 and in response to various adverse
exposures including malnutrition39-41 and maternal infection or
(meta)inflammation29,42. However, the impact of adverse
exposures on the function of nutrient supply and xenobiotic efflux
has not been assessed concomitantly. It is important to
comprehensively understand how the placenta functions as a
conduit to regulate fetal development, since there are many
situations wherein adverse exposures like malnutrition,
infection/inflammation and/or medication use coexist43-47.

Methods
Animal model
All experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee at
Mount Sinai Hospital. In brief, male and female C57BL/6 mice
were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and housed in a single
room under constant temperature of 25°C with a 12:12 light-dark
cycle and free access to food and water. Females were randomised
to one of three nutritional groups48,49: i) mice fed a control diet
(Dustless Precision Pellets S0173, BioServe, Frenchtown, NJ,
USA) ad libitum before mating and throughout pregnancy (CON,
n=7); ii) or mice fed a control diet ad libitum before mating and
until gestational day (GD) 5.5, and then undernourished (UN)
restricting food intake by 30% of control intakes50 from GD 5.517.5, after which females were fed control ad libitum for the
remainder of the study (n=7); iii) or mice fed a high fat (HF) diet
(60% kcal as fat, D12492, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ,
USA) ad libitum from 8 weeks before mating and throughout
pregnancy (n=8). All breeding males were fed control diet ad
libitum for the duration of the study. Mating occurred at ~10
weeks of age, at which time pregnant females were housed
individually in cages with free access to water and their respective
diets. This day represented day 0.5 of pregnancy (GD0.5; term =
19 days). All dams were weighed and food intakes recorded
weekly before pregnancy and daily during pregnancy.

Not all fetuses exposed to adverse environments in utero show
signs of compromised growth, which may be explained by the
placenta’s adaptive capacity, influencing its ability to act as a
selective barrier for trophic factors and other xenobiotics. We

Biospecimen collection and processing
At GD18.5, the period of peak fetal growth and just following
attainment of peak placental volume, maternal blood space, and
fetal capillary development51, dams were killed by cervical
dislocation. Immediately following, tail glucose was measured
using a commercial glucose meter (Roche Accucheck). Dams
were decapitated and trunk blood was collected into heparincoated tubes to isolate plasma. Fetuses and placentae were rapidly
dissected from the uterus and weighed, and tissues were flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C, for later molecular
analyses, or rinsed with ice-cold 1X PBS, then fixed in 10%
neutral-buffered formalin, followed by storing in 70% EtOH at
4°C before being embedded in paraffin for later histological
analyses.
Histological analyses
5 µm paraffin embedded placental sections were stained
according to standard protocols with haematoxylin and eosin Y
(H&E), Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), or with specific primary and
secondary antibodies as described below. H&E and PAS-stained
slides were digitally scanned at 5x or 20x magnification,
respectively, using a Hamamatsu digital slide scanner at the
Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute Optical Imaging
Facility. The resultant images were viewed using ImageJ and the
ImageJ NDPITools plugins52. Measures of placental junctional

and labyrinth zone areas were calculated as described by Bloise et
al.53 (2012). PAS-positive cells were counted in the entire
placental section and expressed as the number of PAS-positive
cells/spongiotrophoblast area or /JZ area. Placental area and
image analysis scoring was conducted on one male and one
female placentae from each dietary group where each sample
selected represented the average fetal and placental weight for that
dietary group53,54. One observer blinded to the experimental
groups performed the image analysis.
Sections from each placentae were also stained for Ki67 P-gp and
BCRP. For Ki67 staining, sections were first rehydrated and then
quenched using 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Fisher, Toronto, ON,
Canada) in methanol for 30 minutes at room temperature. Sections
underwent antigen retrieval first by boiling in 1X unmasking
solution (DAKO, Mississauga, ON, Canada) for 30 minutes and
next by boiling in 10 mM sodium citrate solution for 8 minutes.
Sections were blocked using serum-free protein blocking solution
(DAKO) for one hour at room temperature and incubated
overnight at 4°C with 1:200 dilution of mouse anti-Ki67 antibody
(Novocastra, Concord, ON, Canada) in antibody diluent (DAKO).
Next, a 1:100 dilution of goat biotinylated anti-mouse antibody
(Vector Labs, Burlington, ON, Canada) in antibody diluent
(DAKO) was applied for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by
a 1:2000 dilution of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase
(Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) in 1X PBS for 1 hour at room
temperature. DAB peroxidase substrate (Vector Labs,
Burlingame, CA, USA) was applied for 1 minute 30 seconds to
visualise the antibody signals. Between all steps sections were
washed 3 times with PBS with 0.1% Tween20. Sections were
counterstained with Gill’s #1 haematoxylin. Monoclonal mouse
IgG1 antibody (DAKO) served as the negative control. Six images
were randomly captured at 40X magnification (Leica DMIL LED
inverted microscope and QCapture Pro software) in each of the
following three placental regions for each placenta: chorionic
plate, spongiotrophoblast, labyrinth zone. Image analysis was
conducted by a single observer blinded to the experimental groups
by counting the number of immunoreactive Ki67-positive cells
per image.
Placentae were stained for P-gp (1:500, D-11 Santa Cruz,
Mississauga, Canada) and BCRP (1:200, Calbiochem, Etobicoke,
ON, Canada) as described above with the following changes:
sections were quenched using 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in 1X
PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature; secondary antibody was
goat biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (1:200, Vector Labs); and
DAB peroxidase substrate incubation time to visualise antibody
signals was 30 seconds for both P-gp and BCRP. From stained
sections, six images were randomly captured at 20X
magnification (Leica DMIL LED inverted microscope and
QCapture Pro software) in the spongiotrophoblast and in the
labyrinth zones. Semi-quantitative analysis to score staining
intensity in each image was undertaken by a single observer
blinded to the experimental groups as described previously55.
Staining was scored as absent (0), weak (1), moderate (2), strong
(3) and very strong (4). Mean staining intensity across the six
images for each placental zone for each placenta was calculated.
in situ hybridisation
Placental architecture at GD18.5 was analysed using the
Visiopharm NewCAST software program (Horsholm, Denmark)
following in situ hybridisation using the following probes: Ctsq,
Prl3b1, Pcdh12, and Tpbpa as described previously19. 20% of the
area per placental section was randomly counted at 20x
Connor et al. | bioRχiv | Aug 6, 2019 |

magnification (using an Olympus BX61 microscope) with 20
points per visual field, representing 8.9 mm2 per point/count. A
total of 3 or 4 sections per placenta were analysed from 4 female
and 4 male placentae per dietary group. Total or relative areas for
specific structures were calculated for each section and averaged
per placenta. Structures of interest included glycogen cells, PASpositive cells, sinusoidal TGCs, TGCs, interstitial glycogen cells,
maternal blood space, fetal blood space, maternal blood space in
the JZ, labyrinthine trophoblast and spongiotrophoblast area. JZ
size was calculated by summing spongiotrophoblast, TGC and JZ
sinus areas. LZ size was calculated by summing fetal blood space,
labyrinthine sinus and labyrinthine trophoblast areas.
Plasma biomarker measurements
Commercially available mouse-specific plate assays were used
according to manufacturer’s instructions to measure biomarkers
in maternal circulation. Plasma insulin (Ultrasensitive Mouse
ELISA, ALPCO, Salem, NH, USA), leptin (Mouse ELISA,
Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL, USA), adiponectin (Mouse
High Molecular Weight ELISA, ALPCO, Salem, NH, USA), and
triglycerides (LabAssay Triglyceride Kit, Wako, Richmond, VA,
USA) were measured in plasma. Free fatty acids (Free Fatty Acid
Quantitation Kit, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were
measured in maternal erythrocytes pooled for each dietary group
due to the small volume of erythrocytes available from each
animal making individual animal measures impossible.
mRNA isolation and expression in placenta
Total RNA was extracted from placenta29 using TRIZOL reagent
(Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA purity
and concentration were assessed by spectrophotometric analysis
(Nanodrop) and RNA integrity was verified using gel
electrophoresis. 1 µg RNA was reverse transcribed using 5X
iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (BioRad, Mississauga,
ON, Canada). A non-reverse transcription (NRT; absence of
enzyme) sample was reverse transcribed to provide a negative
control for the RT reaction in downstream PCR applications.
Real-time quantitative (q) PCR (Bio-Rad CFX384, Hercules, CA,
USA) was used to measure relative expression of the following
ABC and fatty acid transport genes: Abcb1a and Abcb1b
(encoding P-gp), Abcg2 (encoding BCRP), Fatp1, Fatp4
(encoding fatty acid transport proteins [FATP], part of the solute
carrier family 27 [SLC27A]), Fat/Cd36 (fatty acid translocase),
Fabppm (encoding fatty acid binding protein plasma membrane),
the placental lipases56,57 El (encoding endothelial lipase) and Lpl
(encoding lipoprotein lipase), and for placental developmental
markers: Ctsq, Prl3b1, Pcdh12, Tpbpa, Cx31.1. Primer sequences
for genes of interest and three stably expressed reference genes
(β-actin, Hprt-1, Gapdh for ABC and fatty acid genes; Tbp, Hprt1, Gapdh for developmental genes) are listed in Supplementary
Table 1). A non-template control (NTC; absence of cDNA
template) was prepared as a negative control for the PCR reaction.
Each real-time qPCR reaction mix was prepared with SYBR
Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada)
and forward and reverse primer mix (3 µM) for each gene.
Standard curves for each gene were run. Standards, samples and
controls were run in triplicate under the following cycling
conditions: 95°C for 20s; 40 cycles of 95°C for 5s and 60°C for
20s and a melt curve at 65°C→95°C with a 0.5°C increment every
5s. Relative gene expression for each sample was calculated using
the Cq value of the gene of interest relative to the geometric mean
of the reference genes’ Cq values using Pfaffl’s relative ratio58.

Protein isolation and expression in placenta
Total protein was extracted from placenta using RIPA buffer with
cOmpleteTM protease inhibitor (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada)
and 100mM sodium orthovanadate. Protein concentration was
determined using BCA assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher,
Mississauga, ON, Canada).
For western blot experiments, 75 µg of each protein was separated
by electrophoresis (100V, 1 hour) using 9% SDS polyacrylamide
gels and then transferred to a 0.2µM polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membrane over 10 minutes (Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo).
Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in 0.05% TBS-T for
1 hour. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies used were: rabbit antiFATP1 (1:250, abcam); rabbit anti-FATP4 (1:1000, abcam),
rabbit anti-FAT/CD36 (1:500, abcam,) rabbit anti-FABPpm
(1:1000, abcam); goat anti-b-actin (1:500 used to normalise
FATP1, FATP4 and FAT/CD36, or 1:1000 used to normalise
FABPpm, Santa Cruz). PVDF membranes were subsequently
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with donkey HRPlinked anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000 for FATP1,
FATP4, FAT/CD36; 1:10000 for FABPpm, GE Healthcare, BioScience, Baie d'Urfe, QC, Canada) or donkey anti-goat secondary
antibody (1:5000 for b-actin, Santa Cruz). Protein-antibody
complexes were detected following incubation of the membrane
with
SuperSignal
West
Femto
(Thermo
Fisher).
Chemiluminescence was detected under UV (VersaDoc, BioRad). Intensity of the bands of interest were quantified using
Image Lab software (Bio-Rad), where the percent intensity for
each band (for proteins of interest and b-actin) was calculated
from the volume intensity of each band, and percent intensity of
the bands from the proteins of interest signals were normalised
against those from the b-actin signal.

transformed to achieve normality, where possible. Differences
between dietary groups for outcome measures were determined
by ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc, or Welch ANOVA with
Games-Howell post hoc, or Kruskal-Wallis test with Steel-Dwass
for non-parametric data (p<0.05). Data are presented as means ±
standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR),
with 95% confidence interval diamonds in figures. Data
transformed for analyses are presented as untransformed values.
Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to assess the effect
of maternal diet on weight gain across pregnancy, and differences
between groups at each gestational age were evaluated by Welch
ANOVA (p<0.05).
Results
Malnutrition impacts maternal metabolism
There was an overall effect of maternal diet on weight gain across
pregnancy (p=0.002). HF mothers were heavier than UN
throughout pregnancy (p<0.05), and maternal UN resulted in
weight faltering from E9.5 to the end of pregnancy (p<0.05 vs.
CON and HF). HF fed mothers did not gain more weight than
CON (Figure 1). In addition to weight faltering, UN mothers had
lower glucose, insulin, leptin and triglyceride concentrations and
leptin:adiponectin ratio at GD18.5 compared to CON (p<0.05;
Table 1). HF dams, despite not weighing more than CON, had
increased leptin concentrations and leptin:bodyweight and
leptin:adiponectin ratios, and reduced triglycerides and
adiponectin concentrations at GD18.5 compared to CON (p<0.01;
Table 1).

For placental LPL protein levels, a mouse-specific ELISA was
used (Cusabio, Houston, TX, USA) according to manufacturer’s
instruction. All protein samples were normalised to the same
concentration in sample diluent prior to assay. Samples were run
in duplicate and mean (SD) %CV between duplicates was 6.98 ±
4.58%.
Placental cytokine measurements
Protein isolated from placental homogenates were assayed for
cytokine levels according to manufacturer’s instructions using the
Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-Plex Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA) and the Luminex system (Bio-Rad; software v6.0). All
protein samples were normalised to the same concentration in
sample diluent prior to assay. Cytokine concentrations are
expressed as pg/mg protein. Cytokines with values above or
below the standard curve range were excluded from analyses
leaving 16 cytokines for analysis in placental samples.
Additionally, placenta from female fetuses exhibited levels of IL17a and G-CSF below the assay’s lower limit of detection, and
therefore data presented for these cytokines only reflect values in
male placentae. Samples were run in duplicate and mean %CV
(range) between duplicates across all 16 cytokines was 5.7 (3.749.65).
Statistics
Outcome measures were tested for normality and unequal
variances (Levene test). Data that were non-normal were

Figure 1. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy. There was an overall
effect of maternal diet on weight gain across pregnancy (p=0.002). HF
mothers were heavier than UN throughout pregnancy (p<0.05), and
maternal UN resulted in weight faltering from GD9.5 to the end of
pregnancy (*p<0.05 vs. CON and HF). Data are mean +/- SD.

Poor maternal diet has little effect on placental inflammatory
markers
There were no major differences in placental inflammation
between dietary groups across a panel of cytokines and
chemokines, although TNF-a levels were slightly elevated in UN
placentae (p=0.04; Supplementary Table 2).
Poor maternal diet impacts fetoplacental growth and is
associated with altered placental architecture

Maternal diet did not alter litter size or number of fetal resorptions
at GD18.5 (Table 2). However, fetal weight, placental weight and
fetal weight to placental weight ratio were significantly lower in
UN compared to both CON and HF pregnancies (p<0.01, Table
2). When stratifying analyses by fetal sex, patterns in
fetoplacental weights remained: both male and female fetuses of
UN mothers were significantly lighter than CON and HF fetuses;
placental weights of UN male fetuses were significantly lighter
than CON male placentae (p<0.05, Table 2).
Both the junctional and labyrinth areas of UN and HF placentae
were smaller compared to controls; differences were greater than
10%, where UN placentae had significantly reduced JZ area
compared to CON (p=0.03; Figure 2). In-depth analysis of
placental architecture revealed significantly smaller calculated
labyrinthine size in HF placentae compared to CON (p=0.03,
Figure 3). There was no effect of maternal diet on placental JZ

size or JZ size:labyrinthine size ratio. Additionally, analysis of
placental architecture revealed significantly reduced fetal blood
space area in HF placentae compared to CON and UN placentae
(p=0.003, Table 3 and Figure 3). Sex-stratified analyses of
placental architecture showed similar trends in both male and
female placentae, but results were only significant in males
(p=0.001, Table 3). Fetal blood space:fetal weight ratio was
significantly reduced in HF fetuses compared to CON and UN
(p<0.0001, Figure 4); sex-stratified analyses showed reduced fetal
blood space:fetal weight ratio in both male (p=0.004) and female
(p=0.001) HF placentae compared to CON (Figure 4).
Poor maternal diet impacts placental differentiation markers
We next evaluated impact of maternal diet on key placental
differentiation markers (Figure 5). Secondary trophoblast giant
cell marker Ctsq, but not Prl3b1 (Pl2), mRNA expression level
was lower in UN placentae compared to HF (p=0.009). mRNA
expression of glycogen cell markers Cx31.1 and Pcdh12 were
lower in HF placentae compared to UN (p=0.002) and CON
(0.0003),
respectively.
mRNA
expression
of
the
spongiotrophoblast marker Tpbpa was not different between
groups (Figure 5). In situ hybridisation for placental
differentiation marker genes (Ctsq, Prl3b1, Pcdh12 and Tpbpa)
showed no obvious visual differences in their expression and
localisation between dietary groups (Supplemental Figure 1).
Ki67-positive cells were present in the chorionic plate,
spongiotrophoblast and labyrinth regions of the placentae
(Supplementary Figure 2). The proportion of Ki67-positive cells
(to total number of cells) were significantly reduced in the
chorionic plate of UN placentae compared to CON and HF
(p=0.007; Supplementary Figure 2), but there were no differences
between groups in other placental regions.
Poor maternal diet differentially affects placental expression of
ABC transporters
To determine whether placental permeability and transport was
altered following maternal malnutrition, we first examined
expression and localisation of placental ABC transporters.
Abcb1a, but not Abcb1b, mRNA expression was lower in HF
placentae compared to UN, whist Abcg2 mRNA expression was
lower in UN placentae compared to HF (Figure 6A). At the
protein level, P-gp was localised to cellular membranes in both
the spongiotrophoblast layer (JZ) and the labyrinth layer, with
some faint and diffused staining within the cytoplasm of
spongiotrophoblasts (Figure 6B). BCRP localisation and staining
intensity was similar to that of P-gp, with somewhat more
cytoplasmic staining in the labyrinthine layer and
spongiotrophoblasts (Figure 6B). There were no differences in
mean staining intensity for either protein in the
spongiotrophoblast or labyrinth layers by semi-quantitative
assessment (Supplementary Figure 3).

Maternal malnutrition is known to impact fetoplacental growth,
the extent of which is dependent on the type and timing of the
nutritional adversity59-61. We found that fetal and placental
weights in late pregnancy were only affected by maternal UN,
whilst some aspects of placental size and structure, including
junctional and labyrinth zone areas, were influenced by both UN
and HF diet. Overall, data from our mouse model suggest that by
late pregnancy, the placenta adapted to maintain fetal growth in
the face of a high fat/high calorie diet, but placental adaptations
to maternal UN were insufficient to protect against fetal growth
restriction. This idea is consistent with previous reports showing
that maternal underweight and UN typically result in smaller
fetuses/newborns, sometimes with growth restriction, and is
associated with reduced placental weight and changes in placental
structure62,63. The data are less consistent for the effects of
maternal lipids64, increasing BMI65-67, and HF/high calorie
diets61,68 on fetal growth and development: some studies report
growth restriction, some report large for gestational age, and
others, no effect on fetal/newborn size. We suggest that in these
HF models the phenotypic outcome is largely determined by how
the placenta adapts to the dietary challenge, which is in part

Discussion
Appropriate placental development and function is essential to
support fetal growth and development. Adequate maternal
nutrition before and during pregnancy is also critical for
establishing and maintaining a healthy pregnancy. Yet, it remains
unclear how the placenta adapts to altered pregnancy
environments, such as suboptimal maternal nutrition, in a manner
that could shape fetal growth and possibly underlie early origins
of later disease. We therefore undertook an approach that
examined the effects of two nutritional contexts, undernutrition
and overnutrition, in parallel, on placental development, and
additionally sought to understand how key placental transport
systems were impacted by these exposures. We hypothesised that
the placenta would adapt differently to maternal UN and HF diets,
through changes in its development and efflux/influx transport,

and these adaptations could explain why offspring of UN and HF
mothers grow differently in utero.

restriction69,70, although it is not clear if these functional deficits
can be traced to earlier morphological deficiencies in the
development of the chorionic plate, including changes in cellular
differentiation, proliferation, or apoptosis, that have been studied
only to a limited extent across gestation71,72.

dependent upon the timing, duration and composition of the high
fat/high calorie diet relative to conception and fetal development.
To examine how the placenta may have adapted to maternal
malnutrition, we took a two-pronged approach, first measuring
characteristics related to its architecture and morphology. We
found that UN was associated with reduced area of the JZ
compared to CON. As the JZ is the major endocrine-producing
layer of the mouse placenta and the TGCs help to maintain contact
with the maternal environment12, our findings suggest that the
maturation of UN JZ may be delayed, possibly impacting
placental endocrine communication with the mother, including
blood flow12. In the labyrinth, Ctsq, mRNA expression was
reduced following UN, which may also indicate a degree of
labyrinthine immaturity, with implications for exchange function.
Additionally, we observed a reduction in the number of Ki67positive cells in the chorionic plate. Reduced proliferation may be
consistent with a delayed or slower growth on the fetal side of the
placenta due to UN, which may compromise the flow of oxygen
and nutrients to the fetus, contributing to growth restriction.
Studies have found altered function, including vascular tone, in
chorionic vessels of human placentae with intrauterine growth

8

Maternal HF diet altered the size of the labyrinthine, but not
junctional zone, layers, which is in agreement with findings from
another study where decidual and labyrinthine layers were
reduced in placentae from HF pregnancies73. That study employed
a somewhat different model; female mice were obese well before
mating, whereas in our model, HF-fed mothers were not heavier
than controls at the time of mating or throughout pregnancy. It
may be that pre-pregnancy obesity has the most detrimental effect
on placental architecture, which is likely to influence placental
function. We also observed a significant reduction in the fetal
blood space area in HF placentae, and compared to UN, reduced
mRNA expression of the glycogen trophoblast cell markers
Pcdh12 and Cx31.1. Additionally, fetal blood space to fetal
weight ratio was significantly reduced in HF placentae (in both
males and females). Collectively, we believe these changes
represent positive adaptations to the effects of HF diet exposure,
where early and excessive growth should be avoided in the face
of nutrient oversupply. As such, the HF placenta may be limiting
substrate availability to the fetus by reducing the area for
exchange at the level of the syncytiotrophoblast or fetal
endothelial cells, the latter which may play an important, but often
overlooked, roll in transplacental transport74. This is a hypothesis
that requires further investigation. Additionally, substrate
availability may be controlled through adaptations in glycogen
cells, possibly due to excess nutrient supply in these HF
pregnancies (and thus, reduced need to store this energy source
for later use by the fetus or placenta).
Second, we measured key aspects of placental function: proinflammatory biomarker levels and its transport capabilities.
Metainflammation, or metabolic inflammation, is thought to be a
mechanism underlying developmental programming, and the
placenta is a likely target for inflammatory exposures which could
compromise placental development and function, and thus,
impact fetal growth. Increasing maternal BMI or obesity during
pregnancy has been associated with some alterations in
inflammatory pathways in the mouse73, and human75-77, but not
the rat78 placenta, but the effects of maternal underweight or
undernutrition on these pathways is far less understood3. Our data,
obtained using a comprehensive panel to measure a series of proinflammatory biomarkers, suggests there is no effect of maternal
HF diet, and little effect of UN, on levels of pro-inflammatory
molecules in the placenta near term. Our finding of increased
TNF-a levels in UN placentae is consistent with increased TNFa production79 and an increase in differentially expressed
immune- and inflammatory-associated genes80 in human
placentae with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), although
we cannot definitively say that increased TNF-a in UN placentae
contributes to the growth restriction seen in our fetuses. The lack
of a placental inflammatory response in HF is interesting, since

we have shown increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
the circulation and small intestine in HF mothers48. Placental
adaptations to maternal UN and HF diet in our model may
therefore be dependent on the effects of systemic
metainflammation, but independent of the effects of local
(placental) inflammatory output, which may be relevant in the
human context for the increasing number of pregnancies
complicated by maternal overweight and increased weight gain in
pregnancy, even independent of obesity81-83. As we did not
measure inflammatory markers or gene pathways in the fetus,
including organs, like the brain, known to be sensitive to
inflammatory stimuli84, our findings do not rule out an indirect
link between changes in maternal inflammatory processes with
altered placental function that can drive poor fetal development.
Previous studies investigating maternal obesity or HF diets on
placental inflammatory pathways73,75,76,78 have used different
models, examined fewer inflammatory markers, and/or only gene
signalling pathways in the placenta, making interpretation across
studies difficult. Yet, the findings from these groups and others
are filling an important knowledge gap on how inflammation
influences placental physiology and possibly, underlies placental
pathologies. Future studies should build on the work of Kim et al.
and Sureshchandra et al. to interrogate placental inflammatory
pathways throughout gestation using multi-system/mulit-omics
approaches in pregnancies complicated by all forms of
malnourishment, not just maternal obesity.
The importance of the placenta as a conduit essential for fetal
nourishment and protection is indisputable. However, most
studies only investigate one aspect of its selective barrier function.
Here, we investigated both, assessing select aspects of xenobiotic
efflux and nutrient supply pathways. Our rationale for a more
global view of transport is grounded in the reality that all forms
of malnutrition often coexists with other adverse exposures like
infection or inflammation, and/or medication/drug use43-47.
Additionally, ABC transporters are sensitive to the effects of
lipids34, but their response to undernutrition, especially in
pregnancy, has been minimally investigated. Consistent with our
hypothesis, transport capabilities of the UN and HF placentae
were different, suggesting that at a functional level, placental
adaptations may depend on the type of nutritional exposure. At
the level of efflux transporters, despite that UN fetuses and
placentae were smaller than CON and HF in our model, placental
expression of the gene encoding the P-gp protein, Abcb1a, was
lower in HF placentae vs. CON and UN placentae. This is
inconsistent with previous findings that associated lower P-gp
expression in preterm small for gestational age humans85 and in
smaller placentae in mice29. However, it may be that UN placentae
have adapted to provide continued protection to the UN fetus in
late pregnancy, and/or these placentae remain functionally
immature, given that expression levels are still high at E18.5
despite that P-gp expression has been reported to decline with
advancing gestation in normal pregnancy31,37. That the late term
UN placenta may be functionally less mature is consistent with
our architectural and differentiation marker findings. Expression
of the gene encoding the BCRP protein, Abcg2, was lower in UN
Connor et al. | bioRχiv | Aug 6, 2019 |

vs. HF placentae, which is consistent with findings in human
placenta with IUGR86. In that study, the authors also found when
using a potent inhibitor of BCRP and at higher concentrations,
other ABC proteins87, there was an increase in TNF-a and IFNginduced apoptosis in primary trophoblast and BeWo cells, which,
taken with the reduced expression levels in IUGR placentae
suggests that BCRP may play an important role in placental cell
survival, contributing to placental dysfunction and fetal growth
restriction.
The fetus, and particularly the brain, is dependent on
transplacental transport of fatty acids in the later part of pregnancy
to support and optimise its development, yet the exposures that
influence fatty acid transfer, and how these affect fetal
development, are only beginning to be understood. Here we found
that malnutrition did not affect expression levels of EL and LPL,
which may indicate that there is no dysfunction at the level of
placental lipoprotein hydrolysis, which is required for the release
of free fatty acids so that these can be taken up by the placental
syncytiotrophoblasts88,89. However dysfunction may be occurring
at the level of fatty acid transport: we found that maternal UN was
associated with reduced placental FAT/CD36 mRNA and protein
expression (a translocase located on both maternal and fetal sides
of the trophoblast90) but increased Fabppm mRNA expression
(located only on the maternal side). As we were unable to measure
fatty acid levels in the fetus, we cannot determine at this time
whether these changes in placental fatty acid transport are
associated with altered circulating levels in the UN fetus or
metabolism in the fetal liver, which could influence fetal growth.
Still, it is likely that there is some maladaptation to maternal UN,
which may prevent sufficient transfer of fatty acids to the
undernourished fetus in late pregnancy, contributing to its reduced
growth. In the human placenta, Chassen et al.91 showed that
syncytiotrophoblast microvillous plasma membrane protein
expression of FATP6 and FAT/CD36 was increased in IUGR
placentae, associated with an increase in the concentrations of n6 and n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which may be a
result of impaired fatty acid efflux transport across the basal
plasma membrane on the of the fetal-facing syncytiotrophoblast.
Maternal HF diet was associated with reduced placental FATP4
protein expression (located on both maternal and fetal sides).
Similar to our findings on placental architecture and development,
we believe the HF placenta has appropriately adapted to the
excessive nutrient supply by restraining the passage of some fatty
acids in an effort to prevent fetal overgrowth, particularly excess
adipose deposition41,64. It is important to note that our findings are
limited because we investigated transporter expression in whole
placental homogenates, rather than isolating the trophoblast
plasma membranes. Whilst we would have had to pool multiple
placentae to obtain sufficient sample for localised assessments,
limiting our ability to look at individual placentae and sex
differences, this is a method used in many elegant nutrient
transport studies61,92,93, and is worth considering for future studies
to truly tease apart the placental transport phenotypes associated
with maternal malnutrition.

As our study is cross-sectional in design, we are unable to
determine the point during which fetoplacental growth (and
likewise, structure and function of the placenta) began to be
impacted by these nutritional exposures, and whether the
trajectory for placental development and function diverged in UN
and HF pregnancies at the same time during gestation. Early
placental phenotypes are important to characterise, because how
the placenta responds to secondary challenges later in gestation
will no doubt be influenced by how, and the rate at which, it adapts
to early pregnancy exposures, and this is particularly true when
speaking of its transport and selective barrier functions41. Future
studies should examine the impact of UN and HF diets on the
placental longitudinally, and relate changes in its development,
structure, and function to detailed longitudinal assessments of
fetal growth, body composition, and circulating lipid and
inflammatory levels, when possible.

In conclusion, we have used an innovative approach to
characterise and understand placental adaptations in mice to two
common nutritional adversities, undernutrition and high fat/high
calorie diet, in an effort to explain why fetuses grow differently
depending on the environments they are exposed to in the womb.
Our study fills important knowledge gaps by assessing placental
architecture, development, and function, and the spectrum of
malnutrition, which can impact fetoplacental development
independent of maternal body composition. Additionally, our
assessment of both nutrient and xenobiotic transport is critical to
understand the many pregnancies globally in which multiple
adversities exist, including poor nutrition, infectious disease and
inflammation, and use of medications or drugs. By uncovering the
relationships between adverse nutritional exposures and placental
development and function, we can better understand why some
fetuses are at risk for, or are protected from, compromised
development. This may inform tailored nutritional approaches for
women before and during pregnancy to optimise fetal
development and in the longer term, postnatal growth and lifelong
health.

Data are mean ± SD or median (IQR). Groups with different letters are significantly different (Steel-Dwass post hoc). *For these
inflammatory markers, only data from male placentae included because data from all female placentae were below the limit of detection
of the assay. IL = interleukin; G-CSF = granulocyte-colony stimulating factor; CXCL1 (KC) = chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1; MCP1 = monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; MIP = macrophage inflammatory protein; TNF = tumor necrosis factor.
