Abstract
Single-cell transcriptomics has sensitivity limits that restrict low abundance transcript identification,
affects clustering and introduce artefact. Here, we describe Constellation DropSeq (C-DropSeq), a
molecular transcriptome filter that delivers two orders of magnitude sensitivity gains by maximising
read utility while reducing sequencing depth and costs. The simple and powerful method is broadly
compatible with library preparation routines and was demonstrated by identifying and characterizing
the activation of rare dendritic cell sub-populations.

Main
The dramatic uptake and expansion of single-cell transcriptome analysis tools has transformed
biological research, enabling reconstruction of population architectures and underlying processes to
be revealed. The tools rely on compartmentalisation of single cells with the introduction of unique
genetic barcodes during library preparation1. Though formidable, not unexpectedly these methods
have sensitivity limits, with associated transcript absence events (dropouts) that restrict the faithful
delineation of cell subtypes and especially overlook low abundant transcripts such as transcription
factors, receptors and signalling molecules that are often pivotal for accurately describing cell
processes and fate2,3. This is a consequence of high abundance transcripts occupying the available
NGS read space and exacerbated by exponential PCR-directed library preparation routines.

Targeted approaches forgo global transcriptome screens, preferring to select transcripts of known
utility and are especially favoured for mechanistic studies. Diverse targeted strategies have emerged;
physical recovery of transcriptome subsets4, coupling custom primers to poly(dT) capture beads
(DART-seq)5 and panel selection by PCR as with the Rhapsody workflow (BD)6. These methods are
technically challenging and introduce substantial costs. Here, we describe Constellation DropSeq (CDropSeq), a remarkably simple, inexpensive and scalable (e.g. >200 targets) approach, introducing a
linear amplification stage in advance of conventional library preparation. Superior performance is

demonstrated with two orders of magnitude sensitivity gains using only a 1/10th of the sequencing
depth for describing system architectures and processes with unprecedented resolution.

The DropSeq beads support 1010 probes5 indicating that sensitivity losses arise from the restricted
NGS read space (~104–6/cell) and also from exponential PCR amplification during library preparation,
where abundant and more efficiently replicated transcripts dominate the available reads. In contrast,
linear (single primer) amplification provides an unbiased route to enrichment across transcripts7,8.
Therefore, in our C-DropSeq approach we have used linear amplification following cDNA synthesis for
the targeted enrichment of transcripts of interest. The method involves replacing the template
switching oligo (TSO) with hybrid primers containing a transcript-specific region adjacent to a
universal handle to select and barcode desired transcripts in a single linear amplification (Fig. 1A;
supplementary Fig. 1). We introduced this linear targeted amplification step to the DropSeq pipeline

to provide a direct comparison that is amenable to cost-effective, large-scale cell screening campaigns
albeit with recognised dropout limitations1.

Figure 1. Characterisation of Constellation DropSeq.
A) C-DropSeq protocol: A hybrid primer (14-18 bp specific sequence, black, adjacent to a common 14
bp handle 2, red) binds to a specific target sequence of cDNA captured on Macosko beads9. A panel of
such hybrid primers can be introduced to standard DropSeq pipeline following cell encapsulation and
generation of STAMPS. Linear amplification of 500-1000 bp stretches of target transcripts allows
selective enrichment of targets of interest, and the inclusion of the cell barcode and UMI sequences,
leads to generation of constellation library, ready to use in Next Generation Sequencing. The initial
template copy number Xo multiplied by the replication efficiency E and the cycle number n. B-F) CDropSeq was compared against DropSeq using a panel of 52 targets with control beads. B) C-DropSeq
UMI counts per bead are 2.7-fold greater than with DropSeq. C) Scaled individual target transcripts
counts show ~100-fold sensitivity gains for genes selected in C-DropSeq. D) A trackplot showing the
data structure in a head to head comparison. Each bar represents a gene expression signal from a
single cell. Full Trackplot is included as Supplementary Fig. 4. E) The fraction of expressing beads as a
function of the mean expression was used as the comparator, error bars represent SD. F) Dramatic
reduction in dropouts achieved by C-DropSeq compared with DropSeq. At 2K UMI counts per bead
32/49 genes were detected in half of the beads (3 negative controls were not detected) in C-DropSeq
whereas only 1 was detected with the same threshold in DropSeq.
Assay development first involved a panel of 20 primers applied to control beads9,10 bearing a bulk RNA
sample to exclude biological variation. Sensitivity was compared between single primer linear
amplification and dual primer exponential amplification (PCR, requiring a SMART-Seq reverse primer)

akin to state of the art methods (e.g. Rhapsody, BD)6. The primer panel contained high, medium and
low expression level transcripts specific for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and
activation traits (Supplementary Table 1). C-DropSeq is amplification cycle and primer concentration
dependent method (Supplementary Fig. 2), with straightforward optimisation enabling the selective
capture of desired transcripts which produce a characteristically spiny tapestation plot (Fig. 1A).
Critically, at 12K reads/bead, linear amplification has a low, 6.8 duplication rate, producing 1,818
UMIs per bead to enable the detection of 17/20 transcripts using a 50% dropout cut-off. In contrast,
exponential amplification has a 24.1 duplication rate, reducing the UMI number to 467 and resulting
in only 13/20 transcripts attaining the 50% dropout cut-off (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Next, C-DropSeq was scaled to 52 targets including 3 negative controls and compared with standard
DropSeq(Supplementary Table 2). Using 15k reads/bead, we demonstrated efficient use of the read
space (93.5% reads) and increasing the average UMI counts/cell at 2.7-fold (Fig. 1B). Individual target
transcript counts from C-DropSeq were on average 83-fold higher (Fig. 1C), dramatically reducing the
dropout rate and providing a uniform gene expression distribution to accurately rank expressed
transcripts (Fig.1 C,D; Supplementary Fig. 5). Standard DropSeq only detected 41 of the targets, while
C-DropSeq detected all 49 targets and none of the control genes (Fig. 1E). The 8 transcripts
exclusively detected by C-DropSeq had average expression levels ranging from 0.03–2.60 counts per
ten thousand (CPTT), without length correlation. In practical terms, when using a 50% dropout cutoff, 32/49 are detected by C-DropSeq and only 1/49 by standard DropSeq at a sequencing depth of 8k
reads/bead (Fig. 1F). Of merit, the sensitivity of C-DropSeq cascades directly into significantly lower
read requirements; the 32/49 transcripts above 50% cut-off are detected when reducing the depth to
4k reads/bead, with losses (28/49) only evident at 2k (Supplementary Fig. 5). This striking feature of
C-DropSeq presents the option to reduce the sequencing depth and associated experimental cost, or
increase the scale of the experiment.

To explore the ability of C-DropSeq to measure gene expression changes in response to perturbation
in a cellular system, we challenged human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a super
antigen Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB, 100 ng/mL, 16 hours). To compare methods 1000 cells per
treatment were sequenced (DropSeq: 200K reads/cells C-DropSeq: 20Kreads/cell, Fig. 2A). In this
context, C-DropSeq consistently detected low copy transcripts such as GZMB, IRF4 and SOCS1 with
reduced dropout and increased UMI counts at 10-fold lower sequencing depth. Differential gene
expression was compared between control and stimuli for both standard DropSeq and C-DropSeq.
The fold change measurements correlated well between the methods (r=0.62, p-value=8e-5, Fig.
2B,C). Importantly, C-DropSeq was 1.6 times more sensitive (assessed by gradient) to gene

expression changes (Fig. 2B), improving the resolution of typical activation features such as
NFKB1/NFKBIA while maintaining comparable expression levels for stable transcripts unperturbed by
stimulation (e.g. CD74). In summary, the linear amplification step in C-DropSeq retains the authentic
biological response, while measuring responses with greater sensitivity and resolving greater detail in
the underlying process (Supplementary Fig. 5).

To demonstrate the applicability of C-DropSeq for the analysis of specific cell subtypes within complex
cellular systems, we designed a primer panel targeting 127 transcripts (Supplementary Table 3) using
a recent molecular classification11 for the identification of dendritic cell (DC) subpopulations and their
activation states. 4000 Human PBMCs were cultured with Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin
lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 µg/mL for 4 hours), a potent inflammatory mediator inducing DC activation
via TLR4. While standard DropSeq was able to segregate the blood cell types, including DCs and
monocytes (Fig. 3A), the technique was not sufficiently sensitive to detect DC sub-populations. In
contrast, the sensitivity of C-DropSeq allowed the classification of expression markers for two DC
subpopulations (DC1: CLEC9A, and DC2: FCERIA11 Supplementary Fig.6, Fig. 3B), Furthermore, CDropSeq provided greater insights into LPS-induced transcriptome remodelling, including the
identification of activation markers (CCR7), cytokines (IL1B) and low abundance transcription factors
(IRF7,) in the DC1 subpopulation (Fig. 3C), and up-regulation of CD83, CCR7 and PSMA1 in DC2
(Supplementary Fig. 6).

using 10X and C-10X. At 1.5K UMI counts per cell, C-10X shows more granularity than normal 10X at

Next the constellation approach was reconfigured for use with the popular Chromium 10x Genomics
technology using 6000 CD14 enriched monocytes. Constellation-10X (C-10X) greatly improved the
detection of transcripts of interest (Fig.3D). C-10X showed 22-fold greater sensitivity allowing
reduction of the sequencing depth from 70k to 1.5K reads/cell, while distinguishing 5 clusters and

identifying rare dendritic cells (FCER1A) and an activated monocyte sub-population (CXCL8). In
comparison standard 10X at 1.5K reads/cell failed to resolve these sub-populations and activation
states (Fig. 3E, Supplementary Fig.7). Indeed, standard 10X requires 70k reads/cell to obtain the same
results, inflating the experimental costs 46-fold (Supplementary Fig. 7) demonstrating both the
sensitivity and financial gains achieved using the Constellation approach.

The simplicity of the Constellation method allows inclusion in almost any single cell transcriptome
library preparation pipelines involving SMART-Seq primers (DropSeq, Seq-Well, 10x and potentially
InDrop). The multiplex scaling capacity is governed by available volume; a 300-plex assay is feasible
for a 50 µL reaction volume (without affection the normal library preparation pipeline;
Supplementary Fig. 8). The highly multiplexed selection of transcripts of interest is at the expense of

global transcriptome coverage, yet benefits from maximising the efficient use of the NGS space to
enable ultra-sensitive investigations. In this manner, the architecture of cellular systems can be
understood with unprecedented resolution and biological processes can be mapped in exquisite
detail. Central to C-DropSeq is prior knowledge of the cellular system, where specific target selection
lends strength to mechanistic studies or allows the prioritisation of targets for targeted perturbation.
Additionally, C-DropSeq can be implemented efficiently in drug discovery, and preliminary toxicity and
efficacy screens for pharmacological compounds of interest. To gain entry to new biological scenarios
and to define the targeted primer library for C-DropSeq, various standard scRNA-seq approaches or
bulk transcriptome analyses can first be applied to provide a global screen of the defining molecules
and pathways of interest.

C-DropSeq builds on standard DropSeq, an already cost-effective single cell transcriptomics approach
for large-scale experiments, while addressing the issues of sensitivity and dropout. With C-DropSeq
further savings emerge from shrinking the required sequencing depth to allow substantially larger
experiments or simply more experiments. The experimental economies, including time-finance trade-

offs, of C-DropSeq and C-10x are compared with standard DropSeq and 10x approaches in
Supplementary Table 4 to inform method selection by end-users. Beyond this, C-DropSeq is accessible

to resource limited laboratories, overall representing a step towards the democratisation of single-cell
transcriptomics and the broad-scale expansion of our understanding of biological systems.

Methods
Primer Design
Primers targeting genes of interest were designed using Beacon Designer primer design software
(PREMIER Biosoft, California US). The last 14 bases from the SMART primer sequence
(TATCAACGCAGAGT) were added to the 5’ end of the designed primers. Desired features of primers
included: a length between 28-32 base pairs, 40-60% GC content, a primer melting temperature
between 52-58°C, and with minimal chance of secondary structures being produced.

Negative control beads
RNA from fresh PBMC was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). Control beads were
generated by adding a solution of PBMC RNA at 10 pg/bead, making the RNA content in each droplet
equivalent. 200 μL of reverse transcriptase mix (75 μL water, 40 μL Maxima 5x RT buffer, 40 μL 20%
Ficoll PM-400, 20 μL 10 mM dNTPs, 5 μL RNase inhibitor and 10 μL Maxima H- RTase) was added to
each bead sample. 10 μL of 50 μM TSO was added to the DropSeq controls, whereas for C-DropSeq
no TSO was used. Samples were incubated with rotation at room temperature for 30 minutes
followed by 90 minutes at 42°C with continuous rotation. Beads were washed with 1 mL TE-SDS (10
mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 5% SDS) and twice with 1 mL TE-TW (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA,
0.01% Tween-20). Finally, beads were washed with 1 mL 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, and stored at 4C.

Human blood was collected from donors with written consent and ethical approval (study number:
17/EM/0349). PBMC were extracted immediately using Lymphoprep™ (STEMCELL Technologies) and
incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. For SEB stimulation experiments cells were cultured in 24 well plates
at 2x106 cells/mL for 16h with or without SEB, using a final SEB concentration of 100 ng/mL. For LPS
stimulation experiments cells were cultured in 24 well plates at 2x106 cells/mL for 4h with or without
LPS, using a final LPS concentration of 1 µg/mL. Following the incubation period cells were harvested,
washed in PBS and counted. 180,000 cells were taken for encapsulation. CD14+ monocytes for the
10X experiment were purchased from Tissue solutions (Glasgow, UK).

DropSeq
Drop-Seq library preparation and sequencing was performed as described previously9. Briefly, single
cells were co-encapsulated with beads in droplets using the microfluidic design provided by Macosko
et al9. After cell lysis, cDNA synthesis was carried out (Maxima Reverse Transcriptase, Thermo Fisher),
followed by PCR (Kapa Hotstart Ready mix, 15 cycles: 4 at 67C, 11 at 65C). cDNA libraries were
tagmented and PCR-amplified (Nextera tagmentation kit, Illumina). Finally, libraries were pooled and
sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq500, (paired end 20x50 bp reads).

Constellation DropSeq
For Constellation DropSeq, experiments were processed as normal from encapsulation through to
extraction and purification of beads from the droplet emulsion. During reverse transcription however,
the template switching oligo (TSO) was absent from the reaction*. This resulted in cDNA fragments
without SMART primer binding sites at the 3’ end of the Macosko bead primers,. Hybrid primers were
pooled at 10 µM. A 50 μL amplification mix was added (25 μL 2X Kapa HiFi Hotstart Readymix, 10 μM
primer pool, 24.6 μL water) to aliquots of 2000 beads (~100 STAMPs). 20 rounds of linear
amplification (at 60℃) were first performed before continuing the standard Drop-Seq protocol for
library preparation with PCR amplification and tagmentation. cDNA libraries were purified twice using

AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) (1:0.6) and libraries assessed using Agillent bioanalyser
(KIT) before tagmentation and Next-seq sequencing.
*Standard reagents including the TSO can be used with the caveat of transcript noise generated by
the reverse SMART primer.

10X Genomics
Single cell libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell 3ʹ library and gel bead kit v3.1
from 10x Genomics. Briefly, 10,000 cells were loaded onto a channel of the 10x chip to produce Gel
Bead-in-Emulsions (GEMs). This underwent reverse transcription to barcode RNA before clean-up and
cDNA amplification followed by enzymatic fragmentation and 5ʹ adaptor and sample index
attachment using the Nextera XT Library preparation kit (Illuumina). Libraries were sequenced on the
MiSeq500 (Illumina) with 28x60 bp paired-end sequencing.

Constellation 10X
For Constellation 10X, 395 pg of cDNA were used for linear amplification comprising 20 rounds of
linear amplification (60°C) using a pool of primers at 10 µM. A 40 μL amplification mix was added (20
μL 2X Kapa HiFi Hotstart Readymix, 10 μM primer pool) to 10 μL of cDNA library. cDNA libraries were
purified twice using AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) magnetic beads (1:0.6) and libraries assessed using
a bioanalyser before tagmentation and Next-seq sequencing on an Illumina Nextseq500, (paired end
28x60 bp reads).

Real Time PCR
Control beads were used to assess the specificity of C-DropSeq. 400 control beads per well were used
as starting material. C-DropSeq libraries were produced by linear amplification using two control
primers (CFL1 and UBB from IDT ) for 5, 10 or 20 cycles. Libraries were purified twice using 0.6X
AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) and eluted with 20 µL 1xTE, pH 8.0. C-DropSeq

libraries were tested using specific primers designed within the amplicon region including a negative
control, CD74. 2 µL of the C-DropSeq library was amplified in iTaq™ Universal SYBR (Bio-Rad)
containing 200 nM of CFL1, UBB or CD74 primers. Amplification was undertaken in technical
triplicates on a HT7900 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Quantification was achieved
against a serial dilution calibration curve of the pool of samples in each plate. Ct values were
thresholded at 0.1 relative fluorescence units (RFU).

Bioinformatic pipelines
Alignment, read filtering, barcode and UMI counting were performed using kallisto-bustools12. High
quality barcodes were selected based on the overall UMI distribution using emptyDrops13. All further
analyses were run using the Python-based Scanpy14. To remove low quality cells, we filtered cells with
a high fraction of counts from mitochondrial genes (20% or more) indicating stressed or dying cells9.
In addition, genes expressed in less than 20 cells were excluded.
Cell by gene count matrices of all samples were concatenated to a single matrix and values log
transformed. To account for differences in sequencing depth or cell size UMI counts were normalized
using quantile normalization. The top variable genes were selected based on normalized dispersion.
This output matrix was input to all further analyses except for differential expression testing where all
genes were used.

Visualization and clustering
A single-cell neighbourhood graph was computed on the 50 first principal components that
sufficiently explain the variation in the data using 20 nearest neighbours. Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was run for visualization. For clustering and cell type
identification Leiden-based clustering 15 at 0.5 resolution was used. Cell types were annotated based
on the expression of known marker genes.

Figure S1. Comparison of the standard DropSeq with C-DropSeq and other targeted methods.
The methods use the same capture probes, with the exception of the DART-Seq method that have
probes extended with target-specific capture sequences (multiplexing is illustrated with shapes).
Following cDNA capture DropSeq and DART-Seq methods progress directly to PCR library
preparation, whereas targeted PCR and the Constellation Drop-Seq methods first involve PCR and
linear amplification cycles, respectively. The amplification behaviour, exponential or linear, is
described by the initial target number Xo, the efficiency of replication E and the cycle number n.

Figure S2 Expression analysis of a C-DropSeq library containing CLF1 and UBB primers.
The library generated from control beads using linear amplification, at primer concentration10 nMol
and 65°C annealing temperature was tested with qPCR for expression of CLF1 and UBB as targeted
genes and CD74 as a negative control. Error bars represent standard deviation (SD).

Figure S3 Head to head comparison of detection of 20 targets using linear vs targeted approach.
A) Expression levels (Normalized UMI counts) detected by linear amplification (orange) and PCR
(blue). B) Drop-out rate vs mean expression levels in linear amplification. Red dots represent genes
included in test library. C) Drop-out rate vs mean expression levels in targeted PCR. Red dots
represent genes included in the library tested.

Figure S6 Two dendritic cell populations uniquely identified by C-DS
Top: UMAP plot showing DC1 cells, control (blue) and LPS (orange) stimulated, (Leiden r=0.5,
n_neighbours = 20). While CLEC9A+ expression is uniform in control and LPS stimulated cells, CXCL8
and IL1B and JAK3 expression can be detected exclusively in LPS stimulated cells. Bottom: UMAP plot
showing DC2 cells, control (blue) and LPS (orange) stimulated. While subset marker, FCER1A+
expression is high in control cells, the expression of CD83, CCR7 and PSMA1, encoding DC activation is
upregulated by LPS. Colour denotes gene expression level, as indicated by the heat-map legend
(normalised UMI counts).

Figure S8 Optimization of Library preparation in C-10X
Typical plot from the bioanalyser (Agilent) showing the library input and primer concentration effect
on library preparation for C-10X. Top: library input – 34 pg/mL, bottom – library input 340 pg/mL.
Left: Primer concentration c= 0.4 𝜇Mol, right: Primer concentration c= 10 𝜇Mol. Y axis shows
fluorescence units (FU) indicating signal intensity and product concentration. The spikes in the plot
are characteristic for Constellation method due to the selection of targets with distinct molecular
weights.
