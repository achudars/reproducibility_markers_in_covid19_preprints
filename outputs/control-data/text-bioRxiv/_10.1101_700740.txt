Abstract

31

Despite knowledge that seasonality and plant phenology impact soil microbiota,

32

farming system effects on soil microbiota are not often evaluated across the growing season.

33

We assessed the bacterial diversity in wheat rhizosphere soil through the spring and

34

summer of 2016 in winter wheat (Triticum aestivium L.) in Montana, USA, from three

35

contrasting farming systems: a chemically-managed no-tillage system, and two USDA-

36

certified organic systems in their fourth year, one including tillage and one where sheep

37

grazing partially offsets tillage frequency. Bacterial richness (range 605 – 1174 OTUs) and

38

evenness (range 0.80 – 0.92) peaked in early June and dropped by late July (range 92 –

39

1190, 0.62-0.92, respectively), but was not different by farming systems. Organic tilled

40

plots contained more putative nitrogen-fixing bacterial genera than the other two systems.

41

Bacterial community similarities were significantly altered by sampling date, minimum

42

and maximum temperature at sampling, bacterial abundance at date of sampling, total weed

43

richness, and coverage of Taraxacum officinale, Lamium ampleuxicaule, and Thlaspi

44

arvense. This study highlights that weed diversity, season, and farming management

45

system all influence rhizosphere soil microbial communities. Local environmental

46

conditions will strongly affect any practical applications aimed at improving soil diversity

47

and functionality, especially in semi-arid regions where abiotic stress and seasonal

48

variability in temperature and water availability drive primary production.

1 Introduction

51

Microbial communities in agricultural soil are influenced by myriad factors,

52

broadly including seasonality and local environmental conditions, and management

53

practices, and the interaction of these influences is understudied. In a dryland agricultural

54

system, we investigated the interaction of farming system and environmental variables,

55

such as soil moisture and temperature, on the bacterial community associated with the roots

56

of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at various points along a growing season.

57

Seasonality may result in variations in temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and

58

solar radiation, all of which drive rates of soil microbial metabolism and respiration, as

59

well as taxonomic composition (Koranda et al., 2013; Orr et al., 2012; Prevost-Boure et al.,

60

2010; Wu et al., 2016). Likewise, environmental conditions alter plant phenology which,

61

in turn, can impact changes in soil microbial communities within a growing season (Donn

62

et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2018; Sayer et al., 2017). Moreover, management practices,

63

particularly those in agricultural systems, are strongly tied to seasonality (Morrison-

64

Whittle and Goddard, 2015), yet the interplay of time and management on microbial

65

community dynamics in soil has not been well described (Bossio et al., 1998).

66

Farming practices such as use of pesticides and fertilizers, tillage, crop rotation,

67

irrigation, and the integration of crop and livestock operations directly select for specific

68

microbial communities in soil (Chaudhry et al., 2012; Ishaq, 2017; Lori et al., 2017).

69

Farming practices also indirectly influence soil microbial communities by influencing

70

weed diversity and biomass, soil compaction, soil moisture and permeability, and

71

arthropod populations (Cregger et al., 2012; Lennon et al., 2012; Ponce et al., 2011; Roger-

72

Estrade et al., 2010). Root-associated soil microbial communities can dramatically affect

73

trophic interactions in natural and agricultural settings, by cycling organic material or by

74

interfacing directly with plants to modulate plant growth, root exudates, and health status

75

(Ishaq, 2017; Mariotte et al., 2017). Greater soil microbial phylogenetic diversity is

76

generally considered beneficial for soil and plant health, as it allows for functional

77

redundancy in the provision of ecosystem services, and for the stability and resiliency to

78

disturbances (Bérard et al., 2011; Kuan et al., 2006; Orwin and Wardle, 2004).

79

Previous studies determined that in comparison with conventional (chemically-

80

managed) no-till and conventional till systems, organic systems have higher soil bacterial

81

cell density and total taxonomic diversity (Chaudhry et al., 2012; Ishaq et al., 2017;

82

Pershina et al., 2015). Yet, many organic systems rely on mechanical tactics like tillage to

83

control weeds. However, tillage use in dryland systems could result in soil erosion,

84

moisture loss, and a change in the community structure of soil microbiota (Ishaq, 2017;

85

Lehnhoff et al., 2017). While there are benefits and limitations of integrated crop-animal

86

production systems (reviewed in (Thiessen Martens and Entz, 2011)), little has been

87

reported on the effect of livestock grazing on soil microbiota. Futher, much of that research

88

has been in pasture-based systems where light stocking increases carbon and nitrogen, and

89

sometimes increases bacterial but not fungal biomass (reviewed in (Ishaq, 2017)).

90

In the northern portion of the Great Plains of North America, wheat (Triticum

91

aestivum L.) is the most widely-planted crop, but production is threatened by insects,

92

climate change, and herbicide-resistant weeds (Keren et al., 2015; Lanning et al., 2010;

93

Menalled et al., 2016). Begininng in 2012, a study has been conducted at the Montana

94

State University Fort Ellis Research and Teaching Center, 3 km east of Bozeman, MT, to

95

compare wheat production challenges across three dryland farming systems: 1) a

96

chemically-managed no-till, 2) an USDA-certified organic system utilizing tillage to

97

manage weeds and terminate cover crops, and 3) an USDA-certified organic system where

98

sheep (Ovis aries) grazing is used to manage weeds and terminate cover crops with the

99

goal of reuducing tillage intensity.

100

In this study, we evaluated patterns in bacterial diversity across the three farming

101

systems described above to elucidate the relative effects of management systems, soil

102

moisture, nutrient content, wheat yield, as well as weed abunandace and diversity on the

103

wheat rhizosphere soil bacterial communities. We hypothesized that 1) date within the

104

growing season be the strongest determinant of bacterial diversity and community structure,

105

2) farming systems would select for different bacterial communities over the entire

106

growing season, and that 3) farming system would modulate the response of the bacterial

107

community to environmental variables such as low moisture, high temperature, and plant

108

senescence.

2 Materials and methods

111

2.1 Site description

112

Beginning in July 2012, a long-term agricultural field experiment was located at the

113

Montana State University Fort Ellis Research and Teaching Center (45.652664056 N -

114

110.97249611 W) to assess agronomic and ecological challenges of chemically-managed

115

(i.e. ‘conventional’) and USDA-organic farming systems, as well as the integration of

116

livestock into organic farming systems. Soils at the Fort Ellis site are a Blackmore silt loam

117

(a fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Arguistoll) with 0 to 4% slopes and consistent

118

ratio of 1 part sand, 2 parts silt, 1 part clay by weight (Miller and Menalled, 2015). Monthly

119

air temperature in Bozeman in 2016 was higher than historic maximum and minimums

120

from 1981 – 2010, and mean monthly precipitation (Table S1) was lower by 18 mm in

121

May, 16 mm June, and 14 mm in July (“PRISM Climate Group,” 2018).

122

The experiment followed a randomized split-plot design; using farming system as

123

the main plot (90 x 75m) with three field replicates per farming system, and crop identity

124

as the split-plot (90 x 13 m). Farming systems consisted of 1) chemical no-till system

125

(CNT), in which synthetic inputs were used in the form of fertilizers, herbicides, and

126

fungicides, 2) USDA-certified till organic (OT), and 3) USDA-certified organic with

127

grazing (OG), which integrates sheep grazing to terminate cover crops and manage weeds,

128

with the overall goal of minimizing tillage intensity in organic production. Split-plots were

129

randomly assigned to a starting crop of a 5 yr crop rotation: year 1 – safflower (Carthamus

130

tinctorius L.) under-sown to yellow sweet clover (Melilotus oficinalis (L.) Lam.), year 2 –

131

sweet clover cover crop, year 3 – winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), year 4 – lentil (Lens

132

culinaris Medik.), and year 5 – winter wheat (Lehnhoff et al., 2017).

133

Chemical inputs utilized in the CNT system included 2,4-D, bromoxynil, dicamba,

134

fluroxypyr, glyphosate, MCPA, pinoxaden, and urea for winter wheat rotations [see Tables

135

2.7 and 2.8 in (Johnson, 2015)], which are reflective of typical farm management practices

136

in the Northern Great Plains region. Both organic treatments began the organic transition

137

process in July 2012, making crops harvested as of 2015 USDA-certified as organic. In

138

the OT system, tillage was accomplished using a chisel plow, tandem disk, or field

139

cultivator, as needed for weed control, seedbed preparation, and to incorporate cover crops

140

and crop residues. Weed control was enhanced with a rotary harrow. In the OG system,

141

targeted sheep grazing was used to reduce tillage intensity for pre-seeding and post-harvest

142

weed control and to terminate the cover crops, with duration and intensity of grazing based

143

on weed biomass (Lehnhoff et al., 2017). Grazing was supplemented with tillage as

144

necessary, based on soil conditions and weed pressure. Seeding was done with a low-

145

disturbance no-till double-disk seeder. Further details of the management practices used

146

within each system and farming history prior to planting of these crops can be found

147

elsewhere (Barroso et al., 2015; Johnson, 2015; Lehnhoff et al., 2017). Outside of normal

148

farm management activities, soil disturbance and compaction was minimized during

149

sampling procedures.

150
151

2.2 Soil measurements and collection

152

In the present study, soil was sampled in the year 3 winter wheat split plots of each

153

faming systems. Soil moisture was measured weekly using gypsum blocks (Friis Dela,

154

2001) buried in the center of each sample area to a depth of 7.5 cm and a Delmhorst soil

155

moisture tester (Model KS-D1, Delmhorst Instrument Co.). Every four hours between

156

April 14, 2016 (one week prior to the first sampling) and July 25, 2016 (final sampling

157

date), soil temperature was recorded within sample areas using an iButton (Maxim

158

Integrated) buried at 7.5 cm.

159

To characterize soil microbial communities, rhizosphere soil cores were obtained

160

from each one of the nine year 3 winter wheat split-plots, within an 0.75 m2 area, situated

161

randomly along the length of each 90-m split-plot. Three soil cores were obtained to a

162

depth of 15 cm using a 2-cm diameter core sampler, which was sterilized with 70%

163

isopropanol and air-dried between sample areas. and from each sample area. Soil (50 mL)

164

was homogenized and placed on ice until transport back to Montana State University,

165

where they were stored at -20°C until analysis. Each area was repeatedly sampled five

166

times during the 2016 growing season: April 21, May 12, June 1, June 22, and July 25

167

(prior to wheat harvesting). Additional soil samples were obtained on July 25, and stored

168

at 4°C until shipped to an independent laboratory (Agvise Laboratories, Northwood, North

169

Dakota, US) for analysis of organic matter, nitrate, phosphorous (Olsen), potassium, and

170

pH (Table S2).

171
172

2.3 Plant community measurements and collection

173

Aboveground biomass of all weed species present within sampled areas was

174

harvested by hand in late June, when most weeds and wheat had matured. Weeds were

175

visually identified and separated by species, dried in an oven at 55° C for two weeks, and

176

weighed. Total wheat biomass was harvested from sampled areas by hand from 1.5 row

177

meters on July 25, 2016, immediately after soil samples had been collected. Wheat biomass

178

was dried in an oven for a week at 55° C, weighed, and then mechanically threshed to

179

remove grain. The grain was submitted for protein analysis to the Montana State University

180

Grain Quality Lab (Bozeman, MT).

181
182

2.4 DNA extraction and sequencing

183

DNA was extracted using 0.25 g of a 15 -30 g soil sample homogenized from at

184

least 3 soil cores within the sample area and processed following protocols described in

185

Ishaq et al. (2017) using the PowerSoil 96-well Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio

186

Laboratories, Inc.). Following extraction, an additional cleaning step was added: a 10%

187

volume of 2M sodium acetate was added to each sample, followed by a 200% volume of

188

100% ethanol. Samples were vortexed and refrigerated overnight at -20°C to precipitate

189

DNA, after which they were centrifuged at 16,000 x G for 5 min, supernatant was poured

190

off, and sample tubes were air-dried. Pellets were washed with 100% ethanol, allowed to

191

air dry again, and eluted into 100 µl of molecular-grade water. The V3-V4 region of the

192

16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified using the KAPA HotStart PCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems,

193

Wilmington, MA) with 10 µL Kappa HotStart Mastermix, 6 µL molecular-grade water, 1

194

µL of each forward and reverse primer at 10 mM concentration, and 2 µL sample DNA.

195

PCR protocol was as follows: 95º C for 3 min; 5 cycles of denaturation at 98º C for 20 sec,

196

annealing at 52º C for 30 sec, elongation at 72º C for 45 sec; 25 cycles of denaturation at

197

98º C for 20 sec, annealing at 60º C for 30 sec, elongation at 72º C for 45 sec. Primers

198

included the MiSeq adaptors (A for forward, B for reverse), the sample index/barcodes, the

199

two-nucleotide linker, and primers 341F (5’-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3’) and 806R

200

(5’-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’) (Caporaso et al., 2011). High-throughput

201

sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and a 500-

202

cycle V2 kit, with PhiX used as a positive control at a 10% spike-in, and molecular-grade

203

sterilized water as a negative control. Sequencing output data can be found in the Sequence

204

Read Archive (SRA) at NCBI under BioProject PRJNA383161.

205
206

2.5 DNA data processing and analysis

207

Bioinformatics were performed similar to previously described protocols (Ishaq et

208

al., 2017) with a few exceptions. Forward and reverse DNA sequence fragments were

209

assembled into contigs using PANDAseq (Masella et al., 2012) with > 15 nucleotide

210

overlap and default quality parameters, then processed using mothur ver. 1.38 (Schloss et

211

al., 2009). Sequences that contained ambiguous bases, homopolymers > 8 nt, < 300 nt or

212

> 580 nt, were discarded. Sequences were aligned to the Silva nr 119 database (Quast et

213

al., 2013) using Needleman-Wunsch alignment (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970), after

214

which all-blank columns and unaligned sequences were removed. Samples with > 50,000

215

sequences were subsampled down to 50,000 to improve analysis time. Chimeras were

216

identified and removed using mother-integrated UCHIME (Edgar et al., 2011), and then

217

taxonomically classified with the Wang algorithm/Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)

218

Classifier (Wang et al., 2007) and Silva reference database. Sequences identified as

219

unknown, mitochondria, chloroplast, or Eukaryotic (< 500 combined) were removed.

220

Sequences which were identified to genera known to contain nitrogen-fixing species in soil

221

were identified from previous literature. The number of seqences per sample which passed

222

QA ranged from 1,305 – 157,761.

223

Sequences were subsampled (normalized) to the size of the smallest sample (n =

224

3232 sequences per sample), removing nine samples with fewer sequences each from

225

downstream analysis. Distance was calculated considering consecutive gaps to be one

226

event, and sequences were clustered into presumptive species-level operational taxonomic

227

units (OTUs) using the nearest neighbor algorithm at a 0.03 cutoff. OTUs which only

228

contained singletons or doubletons were removed. One sample sampled in July in OT

229

(OT_725_114) contained a dramatically different microbial community than its replicates

230

as it had more Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and far fewer of any other phyla represented

231

than other samples (included in Fig 4, S2), and was removed from all group-based

232

statistical analysis.

233

Diversity was assessed using the mothur-integrated versions of Shannon Diversity

234

(Segata et al., 2011), and multivariate analysis and data visualization was performed in R

235

(RCoreTeam, 2018). Diversity data did not meet normality distribution assumptions via

236

Shapiro-Wilks test, thus comparisons of means were conducted with non-parametric

237

Conover tests (Dinno, 2017) using Bonferrroni p value correction for multiple comparisons.

238

Classification-based random forest trees with permuational analysis (rfPermute) were used

239

to identify discriminant taxa, based on “mean decrease accuracy” or the importance of a

240

factor in predicting the microbial community, as measured by randomly re-assigning factor

241

levels and comparing to the original tree of microbial community distribution. Regression-

242

based random forest trees were used to identify important factors for Shannon diversity of

243

abundance of specific taxa (Breiman et al., 2018). The number of trees which minimized

244

the out-of-box error rate was used, typically ntree = 500.

245

Unweighted Jaccard distance (uJ) and Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity (BC) were

246

calculated to compare community membership (presence/absence) and community

247

structure (presence/absence and

248

permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with the Adonis function in the vegan

249

package (Oksanen et al., 2012), or pairwise in the RVAideMemoire package (Herve, 2019),

250

with Block to stratify data, split-plot as a repeated measure, 1,000 permuations, and

251

Bonferroni p-value correction. There was heterogeneity in samples by replicate block,

252

indicating a spatial difference in the soil conditions, which significantly affected bacterial

253

communities (PERMANOVA, uJ, F = 4.498, p = 0.001; Bray-Curtis, F = 3.6676, p = 0.001),

254

thus, all permutational calculations of distance included field replicate block as a

255

stratification. Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling Plots (NMDS) based off Bray-Curtis

abundance), respectively, and assessed using

256

Dissimilarity were calculated in mothur and were visualized using ggplot2 (Wickham,

257

2009). A heatmap of significant Pearson’s correlations between treatment parameters and

258

OTU abundance was created using corrplot (Wei et al., 2017), which generated correlations

259

and tested significance.

260

Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) was conducted using Helligner-

261

transformed community data (Legendre and Gallagher, 2001) and the capscale function of

262

the vegan package, using Block as a condition.

263

categorical treatment levels; soil moisture at soil sampling; the minimum, maximum, and

264

mean soil temperature on the day of soil sampling; the minimum, maximum and mean soil

265

temperature averaged over 3 and 7 days prior to sampling. Biotic and abiotic (meta-) data

266

also included bacterial Shannon diversity; total weed species, total weed coverage,

267

individual weed species coverage, and wheat coverage the previous fall (October 25, 2015),

268

early spring (April 8, 2016), and mid-summer (June 14, 2016), as well as weed biomass in

269

mid-summer (June 14, 2016) and wheat biomass in late-summer (July 25, 2016).

270

Additional significant variables were removed from the original model to create a reduced

271

model, as they were co-linear aliases of included variables, including the biomass in June

272

2016 of C. pastoris, C. arvense, Melilotus spp., and T. arvense, the plot coverage in April

273

2016 of C. album, G. aparine, L. serriola, and T. arvense plot coverage the previous fall in

274

October 2015.

The environmental data included

3 Results

288

The bacterial community in soil was comprised of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria,

289

and Acidobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadates,

290

Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes, and several low-relative-abundance phyla (Fig. 1).

291

Within each sampling date, the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria,

292

Armatimonadetes,

293

Fibrobacteres, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, as well as the candidate

294

phyla BD1-5, BRC1, SHA-109, SM2F11, TM7, WCHB1-60, and WS6 differed among

295

farming systems (Fig. 1; Table S3, p < 0.05). There was an increase in the mean coefficient

296

of variation for the relative abundance of each phylum over the growing season (Fig. S1),

297

indicating that there was more variation in field replicates as bacterial abundance was

298

divergent across individual sample areas when soil was hottest and driest in July.

Chlorobi,

Chloroflexi,

Cynaobacteria,

A total of 8,547 OTUs (97% cutoff) were identified, including many common soil

300

genera which were abundant throughout the growing season in all plots, including

301

Blastococcus, Arthrobacter, Skermanella, Sphingomonas, as well as unclassified genera

302

from several different families (Fig. S2). Other OTUs were specific to system, including

303

Bacteroides which was prominent in OT sample 202 during July, and the insect-associated

304

Wolbachia which was abundant only in a single CNT sampled area in May (Fig. S2).

305
306

3.1 Seasonal effect

307

The effect of sampling date was manifested by the unimodal trend of soil bacterial

308

richness over the 2016 growing season. Across the three farming systems, observed OTU

309

(97% cutoff) richness peaked in early June, when it was greater than in April, May, or July

310

(Fig. 2 A, B; Conover, p < 0.05 each, Bonferroni corrected (BF)). Richness was also

311

greater in late June than in July (Fig. 2 A, B; Conover, p < 0.05 each, BF). Similarly,

312

Shannon-Weiner diversity index of soil bacteria peaked in early June when it was

313

significantly higher than in April, May, late June, and July (Fig. 2C; Conover, p < 0.05

314

each, BF). This change in Shannon diversity over the growing season was driven by

315

changing richness, rather than changes in evenness (Fig. 2D) which was only significantly

316

increased in early June as compared to April (Conover, p = 0.004, BF).

317

Sampling date significantly affected bacterial community similarity based on

318

member presence/absence collectively across the growing season (Table 1, uJ), but was

319

not significantly altered in any pairwise sampling date comparison (uJ, p > 0.05 BF),

320

contrary to our first hypothesis. Sampling date similarly affected bacterial community

321

similarity in relation to relative abundance (Fig. 3; Table 1, BC, p = 0.0001), and was driven

322

by significant differences between June and July (Table S4) when richness was low: early

323

June - July (p = 0.014), and late June-July (p = 0.022).

325

3.2 Farming system

326

Farming system had an equivocal effect on community membership to sampling

327

date during the growing season, and significantly affected both OTU presence/absence

328

(Table 1, uJ), and membership with respect to relative abundance (Table 1, BC). The

329

collective effects that farming system exerted upon soil bacterial communities was

330

observed between CNT and OG plots (Table S5), both in presence/absence (uJ, F = 1.387,

331

p = 0.01), and weighted community structure (BC, F = 1.676, p = 0.014), indicating a

332

difference in presence/absence as well as relative abundance, respectively. OG and OT

333

contained significantly different communities by presence/absence (uJ, F = 1.41, p = 0.011).

334

CNT and OT had only equivicoally different presence/absence composition (uJ, p = 0.051).

335

Richness, evenness, and Shannon Diversity were not significantly different

336

between farming systems at any time point, or averaged across the growing season

337

(Conover, p > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected (BF)). Thus, there was no significant difference

338

on a pairwise basis between each farming system within each time point (Fig. 3;

339

PERMANOVA uJ and BC, p > 0.05). However, there was more variability in soil bacterial

340

communities at the end of the growing season (betadisp, uJ and BC, p < 0.01), there was

341

no significant interaction between sampling date and farming system (PERMANOVA, uJ

342

and BC, p > 0.05; Table 1). There was no significant interaction between sampling date

343

and farming system in soil microbial community clustering (PERMANOVA, BC and uJ,

344

p = 1 BF).

345

Within the CNT and OG farming systems, a large number of OTUs were commonly

346

sampled across the growing season: CNT samples shared 4,530 (53.0% of total OTUs),

347

OG shared 4,536 (53.1% of total OTUs), and OT shared 4,207 OTUs (49.2% of total

348

OTUs). All farming systems shared 3,555 OTUs in April (54.3% of total), 3,086 OTUs in

349

May (47.2% of total), 2,973 OTUs in early June (45.4% of total), 3,025 in late June (46.2%

350

of total), and 2,043 in July (23.9% of total).

351

Random forest classification was not able to predict bacterial communities based

352

on farming system (Fig 4; OOB estimate of error rate: 48%) or time point (not shown;

353

OOB estimate of error rate: 69%) with reliably high accuracy. OT plots contained more

354

putative nitrogen-fixing bacterial genera than OG or CNT (Fig. 5A). Arthrobacter was

355

more abundant in organic plots across all time points, and particularly OT plots, though

356

CNT plots contained more Flavobacterium and an unclassified 97%-cutoff OTU in the

357

Bradyrhizobiaceae family (Fig. 5A). All but the least abundant genera were significantly

358

(p < 0.05) differential for farming system (Fig. 5B). Soil moisture, soil temperature, and

359

total and individual weed species biomas were important predictors of Arthrobacter

360

abundance (Fig. 5C).

361
362

3.2 Plant community and environmental variables

363

Biotic and abiotic variables affecting the soil bacterial communities included

364

farming system, sampling date, minimum and maximum temperature on the day of

365

sampling, total weed diversity on both April and June 2016, Taraxacum officinale percent

366

coverage the previous fall in October 2015, Lamium ampleuxicaule percent coverage in

367

April 2016, and T. arvense percent coverage in April 2016 (ANOVA, p < 0.05; Fig. 6).

368

Only weak (-0.4 to 0.4) Pearson’s correlations existed between bacterial Shannon

369

diversity and various bacterial and weed species (Fig. S3, p < 0.05), likely because most

370

samples maintained a high Shannon Index (range 5.2 - 6.6). When separated out by

371

sampling date, the strength of the correlations between the top soil bacterial OTUs in early

372

June (Fig. S4) and late June (Fig. S5, p < 0.05) increased. Total Shannon diversity and

373

abundance of many of the most-abundant bacterial OTUs were negatively correlated with

374

increased soil temperature at respective date of sampling (Fig. S6, p < 0.05). However,

375

Arthrobacter, Skermanella, Sphingomonas, Comamonadaceae, Bacteroides, Arenimonas,

376

and Microvirga were positively correlated with soil temperature (Fig. S6, p < 0.05). Soil

377

moisture on the day of sampling was positively correlated with the most-abundant bacterial

378

OTUs, but showed a weakly-positive correlation with Shannon diversity (Fig. S6, p < 0.05).

379

Soil pH was negatively associated with a number of bacterial genera, as was wheat

380

protein (Fig. S7, Pearson’s corelations, p < 0.05). Soil pH was lower in CNT than OG

381

(ANOVA, p < 0.05); CNT (mean 5.9), OG (mean 7.00), OT (mean 6.77). Nitrate was

382

negatively associated with the putative genus 480-2, an unnamed clade in the

383

Actinobacteria phylum (Fig. S7). Organic matter was not correlated with any of the most-

384

abundant bacterial OTUs identified in July soils, but nitate was strongly negatively

385

associated with the putative genus 480-2 (order Solirubrobacterales, phylum

386

Actinobacteria) (Fig. S7).

4 Discussion

389

Agricultural production in the Great Plains of North America is strongly tied to

390

seasonality, which alters temperature, moisture, solar radiation, and plant phenology.

391

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most widely-planted crop, and understanding the

392

dynamics between production, soil microbial communities, and farming system, separately

393

and with respect to seasonality, is important to continued sustainability. This research

394

assessed the impact of management systems and time within the growing season on the

395

status of bacterial communities in three contrasting dryland farming systems: a chemically-

396

managed no-till system and two organic farming systems that were maintained for four

397

years under USDA-organic prescribed conditions.

398
399

4.1 Farming system over the growing season

400

Farming systems selected for different bacterial communities, which has been well-

401

established at single time-points, however we did not find significant farming system x

402

time effects. Transitioning a farm to a USDA organic-certified system takes just three

403

years to complete legally, yet it has been noted that soil microbial systems may take years

404

to decades to transition to a new, stable community (Chaudhry et al., 2012; Hartmann et

405

al., 2015; Sayer et al., 2017; Stagnari et al., 2014). Thus, the studied soil bacterial

406

communities can be considered to be in transition, but, to our knowledge, the changes in

407

soil microbial communities occurring during that transition or in recently certified organic

408

system are unknown. However, the relevance of our study resides in the fact that the

409

sampled organic fields represent certified systems from which farmers could perceive a

410

significant economic premium (Lawrence et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2007). Variations in

411

the soil bacterial community, including a reduction in total taxonomic diversity and a shift

412

in abundance towards particular taxa, resulting from a change in management system

413

occurs on a shorter time scale, (Lupwayi et al., 2004; Stagnari et al., 2014) compared with

414

soil fungal communities (Stagnari et al., 2014). Nevertheless neither soil bacterial and

415

fungal communities may reach a steady state for a long time, if ever, depending on the

416

specific disturbance regime associated with in the agricultural system where they occur.

417

Further, even after just four years under these management practices, we saw changes in

418

the soil bacterial community.

419

In this study, soil from the OG system exhibited less variation between plots in

420

bacterial species richness and moisture later into the growing season than the plots from

421

the OT system, and a neutral pH compared to the CNT systems. In July, more dispersion

422

was observed in community clustering, and in particular, OT plots had highly variable

423

mean evenness and richness between field replicates in July. This suggests a random

424

divergence of the bacterial community rather than a selective pressure in those plots at that

425

time. These differences may suggest that farming system may mediate the effects of the

426

environment, per our third hypothesis. Yet, the lack of strong community divergence by

427

farming system would suggest that the effects of environment may supersede the selective

428

effects of farming, or else that the farming systems, though past USDA certification, had

429

not been implemented long enough to significantly alter bacterial communities in the soil.

430

However, many of our time x farming system comparisons lacked significiance, possibly

431

due to the variability in OT plots, or too few replicates. The effect of time within the

432

growing season on soil microbial community dynamics is not well studied (DeBruyn et al.,

433

2011; Marine et al., 2015).

434
435

4.3 Plant community and environmental effects over the growing season

436

July in Montana is very hot and dry, so much so that all three farming systems

437

exhibited similarly low moisture levels. The unimodal nature of bacterial richness and

438

eveness in all systems coincides with peak crop growth, and the reduction is July

439

corresponds with both the weather and crop senescence, both of which would affect

19

440

microbial communities. Bacterial community structure in soil varies seasonally, reflecting

441

seasonal changes in plant phenology, solar radiation, moisture or temperature, all strong

442

drivers of bacterial species richness (Prevost-Boure et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2016). Bacterial

443

activity, such as nitrogen fixation, is also strongly tied to soil moisture (Koranda et al.,

444

2013; Orr et al., 2012). In our study, soil moisture was not a significant factor structuring

445

the entire soil bacterial community, which may reflect the prevalence of relic DNA in soils

446

(Carini et al., 2017). However, moisture was an important predictor of the abundance of

447

the genus Arthrobacter, some members of which are nitrogen-fixers (Westerberg et al.,

448

2000), and which are reported to thrive in adverse conditions, including low moisture and

449

high radiation conditions (Mongodin et al., 2006; SantaCruz-Calvo et al., 2013). Futher,

450

numerous Arthobacter species are adept at using various carbon sources, including

451

pesticides (Hagedorn and Holt, 1975). This is in contrast to other nitrogen-fixers, which

452

are susceptible to pesticide toxicity (Orr et al., 2012).

453

Changes in weed diversity has been found to correlate with soil bacterial diversity

454

throughout the year (Aguilera et al., 2017; Cardinale et al., 2015; Grayston et al., 1998;

455

Ishaq et al., 2017; Whiting et al., 2001). Contrary to previous studies, (Flohre et al., 2011;

456

Kubota et al., 2015) though, bacterial richness was positively correlated with total weed

457

diversity only in April and weakly negatively correlated with total weed diversity in June,

458

which was driven by the interaction between bacteria and several plant species. In

459

agreement with the present study, T. arvense has been found to be associated with low

460

bacterial diversity in soil (Whiting et al., 2001), possibly because members of the

461

Brassicaceae family of plants produce a number of glucosinolates and other antimicrobial

462

compounds (Pal Vig et al., 2009), which may inhibit microbial growth in the rhizosphere.

20

463

Similarly, and in accordance with (Cardinale et al., 2015), L. serricola was associated with

464

low soil bacterial relative abundance.

465

Previous studies have shown that some weed species are better at recruiting

466

beneficial microbiota than domesticated crops, allowing them to be more competitive

467

(Aguilera et al., 2017; Massenssini et al., 2015; Trognitz et al., 2016). Recent discussions

468

have examined the possibility that weed species are more dependent on plant-microbial

469

connections, while crops only need them under non-ideal growing conditions (Trognitz et

470

al., 2016). Also, it has been shown that plants will reprioritize microbial interactions under

471

stressful conditions (Fuchslueger et al., 2014). However, seasonal changes in moisture or

472

nutrient availability, as well as plant phenology, dictate the need for plants to form

473

symbiotic relationships with soil microbiota (Fuchslueger et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2018),

474

thus the interaction between plant species and microbial species may be uncoupled at

475

certain points of the year, i.e. at plant senesence.

476
477

4.4 Summary

478

In the context of these receent studies, our results raise speculative but interesting

479

questions for the sustainability of managed systems; how does soil bacterial diversity

480

impact crop-weed competitive interactions under stressed and ideal environmental

481

situations? Does the degree of these dependeces vary across farming systems (Johnson et

482

al., 2017)? What are the mechanisms driving the impact of soil microbial communities on

483

plant growth and multi-trophic interactions? Local environmental conditions strongly

484

affect any practical applications aimed at improving soil diversity and functionality,

485

especially in semi-arid regions where abiotic stress and seasonal variability in temperature

486

and water availability drive primary production. Thus, it is imperative to incorporate

487

seasonality into studies on the microbial ecology of agricultural systems.
