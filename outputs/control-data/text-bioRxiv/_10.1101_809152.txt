Abstract

22
23

Virus resistance genes carried by wild plant species are valuable resources for plant

24

breeding. The Rysto gene, conferring a broad spectrum of durable resistance, originated from

25

Solanum stoloniferum and was introgressed into several commercial potato cultivars,

26

including ‘White Lady’, by classical breeding. Rysto was mapped to chromosome XII in

27

potato, and markers used for marker-assisted selection in breeding programmes were

28

identified. Nevertheless, there was no information on the identity of the Rysto gene. To begin

29

to reveal the identification of Rysto, fine-scale genetic mapping was performed which, in

30

combination with chromosome walking, narrowed down the locus of the gene to

31

approximately 1 Mb. DNA sequence analysis of the locus identified six full-length NBS-LRR-

32

type (short NLR-type) putative resistance genes. Two of them, designated TMV2 and TMV3,

33

were similar to a TMV resistance gene isolated from tobacco and to Y-1, which co-segregates

34

with Ryadg, the extreme virus resistance gene originated from Solanum andigena and localised

35

to chromosome XI. Furthermore, TMV2 of ‘White Lady’ was found to be 95% identical at the

36

genomic sequence level with the recently isolated Rysto gene of the potato cultivar ‘Alicja’. In

37

addition to the markers identified earlier, this work generated five tightly linked new markers

38

which can serve potato breeding efforts for extreme virus resistance.

Introduction

42
43

For sustainable intensification of crop production, disease control should, when

44

possible, be achieved using genetics rather than using costly recurrent chemical sprays. Wild

45

relatives of crop plants are a good source of genes for disease resistance. Potato (Solanum

46

tuberosum), the world’s fourth most important food crop, following maize, wheat and rice,

47

can be crossed with a number of wild Solanum species. Nevertheless, classical breeding for

48

resistance is time-consuming, and it is extremely difficult to recover the parental combination

49

necessary for beneficial alleles in the progeny. Thus, there is great value in genetic

50

approaches that can improve disease resistance in potato varieties without disrupting

51

favourable combinations of alleles [1].

52

One of the major factors adversely affecting potato production worldwide is virus

53

infection. Viruses such as Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) and Potato virus Y (PVY) can affect

54

yield substantially, with up to 80% losses, while viruses producing mild or latent symptoms,

55

such as Potato virus X (PVX) and Potato virus S (PVS), show yield losses of at most 10 to

56

20% [2]. Host plants can exhibit compatible or incompatible interactions with a virus. In a

57

compatible interaction, potato plants can be either tolerant, accumulating high titres of the

58

virus without symptoms, or sensitive, responding to viral infection with development of

59

disease. In an incompatible interaction, the plants respond to viral infection with a

60

hypersensitive reaction (HR) or an extreme resistance (ER) response. The HR is accompanied

61

by programmed cell death and restricts virus multiplication and spreading. It manifests as

62

necrotic lesions on inoculated leaves and leads to the induction of systemic acquired

63

resistance. The HR is strain-specific and affected by environmental factors (e.g. heat),

64

whereas ER acts against a broad spectrum of virus strains by limiting their accumulation, and

65

only a few or no visible symptoms appear [3]. In potato, HR correlates with the presence of N

66

genes, while ER is manifested by R genes [4].

67

Although a relatively large number of virus-resistance genes have been mapped to

68

various chromosomes in potato [5], only a very few of them were isolated and characterised at

69

the DNA sequence level. The first one was the dominant gene Rx1, controlling ER to PVX,

70

followed by Rx2. Despite their different origins (S. andigena and S. acaule) and chromosomal

71

locations (XII and V), Rx1 and Rx2 share 95% sequence identity [6-8]. At the chromosome

72

XII Rx1 locus, there are at least three homologues of Rx1 and the potato cyst nematode-

73

resistance gene Gpa2, which is highly similar to Rx1 [9]. Rx was identified as a protein with a

74

conserved nucleotide binding site and a leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR or, shortly, NLR)

75

belonging to the largest class of plant R proteins that can mediate both HR and ER responses

76

[10].

77

ER against PVY is conferred by Ry genes. As early as 1970, five Ry genes had been

78

described [11], and three Ry genes have already been mapped on potato chromosomes. One of

79

them originates from the wild species S. tuberosum ssp. andigena (Ryadg) and was mapped on

80

chromosome XI [12]. Another one, derived from S. chacoense (Rychc), is located on

81

chromosome IX [13], while the third one, derived from S. stoloniferum (Rysto), was mapped to

82

chromosome XII [14-16]. A gene, designated Y-1, co-segregating with Ryadg, was cloned and

83

found to be structurally similar to gene N that confers HR to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in

84

Nicotiana spp. and belongs to the Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-type NLR genes [17]. A Ry

85

gene similar to Y-1 was isolated from the Korean potato cultivar ‘Golden Valley’ and

86

introduced into the ‘Winter Valley’ cultivar which is susceptible to PVYO infection. The

87

transgenic ‘Winter Valley’ showed resistance to PVYO infection [18]. In contrast, leaves of

88

transgenic potato plants expressing Y-1 under the control of the CaMV-35S promoter

89

developed necrotic lesions upon infection with PVY, but no significant resistance was

90

observed, and plants were systemically infected with the virus [17].

91

Both the environment and evolution modulate viral pathogenesis in plants and R genes

92

are in many cases overcome by resistance-breaking strains [19,20]. Rysto was introgressed into

93

S. tuberosum almost 60 years ago, and various European potato cultivars currently bear Rysto

94

[21]. Rysto was also introduced into S. tuberosum at the Potato Research Centre, Keszthely,

95

Hungary. There has been no indication so far that even the most aggressive PVY strain, NTN,

96

could overcome the ER of Rysto-bearing potato cultivars [22], including the Hungarian cv.

97

‘White Lady’ [23]. This phenomenon of unusually durable resistance of Rysto-bearing potatoes

98

prompted us to map Rysto on a fine scale and characterise the Rysto locus at the DNA sequence

99

level.

106

Four hundred fifty-seven genotypes of the tetraploid F1 population described by [23]

107

from a cross between cv. ‘White Lady’ and ‘S440’ were tested for segregation of the Rysto

108

gene. The parents and 81 hybrids were obtained from the Potato Research Centre, Keszthely,

109

Hungary, as in vitro plants, while the others were grown from seeds. Seed surfaces were

110

disinfected with 20% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min and rinsed with sterile water three

111

times. Seeds were germinated on 1% water-agar Petri plates and placed into 35-ml tubes

112

containing 7 ml RM medium (MS medium without vitamins) [24] containing 2% (w/v)

113

sucrose, solidified with 0.8% agar. Tubes were closed with paper plugs. In vitro culturing was

114

performed at 24°C under a light regime of 16 h of light at 75 µmol m-2 s-1 intensity and 8 h of

115

darkness. Propagation of the plants was carried out in vitro.

Potato transformation

118
119

For transformation, the potato cv. ‘Désirée’ was propagated in vitro in 500-ml jars in

120

MS medium [24] containing 2% (w/v) sucrose and solidified with 0.8% agar (5 plants/jar).

121

The recombinant vectors from Escherichia coli were introduced into Agrobacterium

122

tumefaciens strain C58C1 containing pGV2260 [25] by triparental mating [26]. Transgenic

123

‘Désirée’ lines were generated by leaf transformation according to [27], with 50 µg ml-1

124

kanamycin added to the selection media.

125

In the case of the potato breeding line ‘S440’, tissue culture-derived sterile

126

microtubers were used for transformation as described by [28] with the exception that the

127

shoots were regenerated and rooted in the presence of 50 µg ml-1 kanamycin in the media.

128

Total DNA of putative transgenic plants grown in tissue culture was isolated by the method of

142

plants were dusted with carborundum powder, and 100 µl of sap prepared from PVYNTN-

143

infected tobacco plant leaves was dropped and dispersed with a micropipette tip onto each

144

leaf. The sap was rubbed into the leaves using a pestle. Non-inoculated upper leaf samples

145

were collected three weeks after inoculation. Detection of the virus was performed by RT-

sequence (S1 Fig.). The YES3-3A marker [33] was also amplified from ‘White Lady’, cloned

214

Fine-scale genetic mapping of the Rysto gene

215
216

According to the previous result obtained by [31], the tetraploid potato cultivar ‘White

217

Lady’ carries the Rysto gene in simplex form. In this study, among the 457 tested F1 genotypes

218

derived from a cross between ‘White Lady’ and ‘S440’, 220 resistant plants and 237 plants

219

sensitive to PVYNTN infection were identified. The segregation ratio of 1:1 confirmed the

220

presence of a single, dominant gene for extreme resistance to PVYNTN in simplex state in the

221

tetraploid parental variety ‘White Lady’.

222

Molecular markers co-segregating with Rysto, e.g., STM0003, YES3-3A, Cat-in2 and

223

ST1, were identified earlier [16,31-33,40]. The closest markers to Rysto in the genetic map of

224

‘White Lady’ were STM0003 and ST1 in a distance of 2.95 and 0.53 cM, respectively [31].

225

Since STM0003 seemed to be too far from Rysto to start chromosome walking towards the

226

resistance gene a fine mapping was carried out by testing the co-inheritance of the above

227

listed four molecular markers with the virus resistant/sensitive phenotype in 400 genotypes

228

derived from the ‘White Lady’ x ‘S440’ cross. Seven recombinants between STM0003 and

229

Cat-in2 were identified. Thus, the genetic distance between the two markers was estimated to

230

be 1.75 cM. STM0003 at the proximal site and Cat-in2 at the distal site surrounded the Rysto

231

gene. Based on the recombinant events detected in the seven recombinants (Fig. 1), the order

232

of the four markers, STM0003, YES3-3A, ST1 and Cat-in2, was established as shown in Fig.

233

241
242

The availability of the S. tuberosum Group Phureja genome sequence (Potato Genome

243

Sequencing Consortium 2011) provided the possibility for physical mapping of the Rysto

244

locus. Browsing the PGSC database, we found the STM0003 marker on the supercontig

245

PGSC0003DMB000000114. To position additional markers of the Rysto locus on

246

supercontigs, the ST1 and YES3-3A PCR fragments of ‘White Lady’ were cloned and

247

sequenced (S1,2 Fig.). DNA sequence comparison localised YES3-3A to the same

248

supercontig as STM0003, while ST1 identified PGSC0003DMB000000034.

249

The tomato (S. lycopersicum) genome sequence was also available in the database

250

(The Tomato Genome Consortium, 2012), and we found that a large number of markers were

251

localised to the tomato region orthologous to the identified potato supercontigs. Based on

252

these tomato markers, 16 primer pairs were synthesised and tested; however, only one of

253

them, designated SGN-U256066, showed polymorphism between ‘White Lady’ and ‘S440’.

254

This marker was located between STM0003 and YES3A (Fig. 1 and 2).

258

CadInd and Cat-in2 were calculated from recombination frequencies between DNA markers

259

and resistance loci, whereas localisation of 1.156, DisRes, 1.110, ST1, and 1.109 were based

260

on the Phureja genome sequence. Published markers are red-coloured.

261
262

Isolation of BAC clones overlapping the Rysto locus

263
264

A BAC library was constructed from the genomic DNA of ‘White Lady’. Physical

265

mapping started with screening the BAC library using the ST1 marker by which five positive

266

BACs were identified (Fig. 3). In a subsequent experiment, YES3-3A identified one BAC

267

clone (Fig. 3). The ends of the six positive BACs were sequenced. Sequences were mapped to

268

the S. tuberosum Group Phureja genome sequence. The comparison localised the Rysto locus

269

to the 57-59 Mb segment of chromosome XII in Phureja. The obtained sequences were used

270

for new marker development. A screen for markers in the intergenic regions successfully

271

identified a polymorphic marker designated 1.365. Genetic mapping of 1.365 reduced the size

272

of the Rysto locus and localised Rysto between Cat-in2 and 1.365 (Fig. 1, 2 and 3). To close the

273

genetic window, further PCR primers were designed based on the Phureja genome sequence

274

and tested for polymorphism between ‘White Lady’ and ‘S440’. Three new markers were

275

found in this way: CadInd, Sec15 and DisRes. Testing the six lines bearing recombination

276

between Cat-in2 and 1.365 with the new markers, the Rysto locus could be narrowed to the

277

Sec15-1.365 fragment between 58 and 59 Mb (Figs. 1, 2 and 3). BAC walking was continued

278

with Sec15, DisRes and 1.365 markers and resulted in the isolation of five new clones, two by

279

DisRes and three by 1.365 (Fig. 3). No BACs were isolated by Sec15 in the 48 pooled

280

samples tested. To close the gap between the isolated BAC clones, an attempt was made to

281

identify new polymorphic markers based on the end sequences of BAC inserts. This attempt

282

resulted in the identification of markers 1.109, 1.110 and 1.156 (Figs. 1 and 2). In comparison

283

to the Phureja genome sequence, isolation of one BAC clone by 1.109 and another clone by

284

1.110 closed the gap between the BACs overlapping the Rysto locus (Fig. 3).

the S. tuberosum cv. ‘White Lady’ corresponds to the 58-59-Mb region on chromosome XII

in the genome-sequenced S. tuberosum Group Phureja DM1-3 516R44. This region of

Phureja has sequence gaps probably due to its highly repetitive nature. Markers used for

Six presumably overlapping BAC clones, namely, 443B9, 109D9, 154G1, 164H4,

301

156F6 and 626B1 (Fig. 3), were sequenced. The reads were de novo assembled both pooled

302

and individually by the A5-miseq pipeline. The pooled BAC reads gave 49 contigs, which

303

were greater than 3 Kb. The sum length of these contigs was 0.97 Mb out of which 0.38 Mb

304

could be aligned to the ~1 Mb region of Phureja corresponding to the Rysto locus in ‘White

305

Lady’ (S3 Fig.), while 243 Kb mostly repetitive sequences were mapped to other regions of

306

the Phureja genome. Interestingly, 313 Kb did not map at all to the Phureja reference genome.

309

corresponding BAC clone sequences and only 1-2 bp difference was detected in the case of

310

the other three primers (S5 Fig.) indicating that all six BAC clones were originated from the

311

Rysto-bearing chromosome.

312

The end regions between the six sequenced BAC clones were examined pair-wise. As

313

expected, the 443B9, 109D9 and 154G1 BAC clones showed 100% identity in the

314

overlapping regions. Unfortunately, the overlapping region between the 154G1 and 164H4

315

BAC clones was restricted only to 8 bp including a HindIII site, which served as the cloning

316

site during generation of the BAC library. In order to demonstrate the adjacent position of the

317

two BAC clones a primer pair complementary to the corresponding ends of 154G1 and 164H4

318

was designed and used in PCR with ‘White Lady’ genomic DNA as a template. The reaction

319

resulted in an approximately 0.45 kb PCR product as it was visualised on an agarose gel. The

320

PCR product was cloned and Sanger-sequenced. Clones representing all four chromosomes

321

were obtained with no additional sequences compared to the 8-bp overlap between 154G1 and

322

164G1 (S4 Fig.) indicating that 154G1 and 164H4 represent a continuous fragment of the

323

Rysto locus. On the other side, the end of the 164H4 BAC clone showed 100% identity with

324

the overlapping 156F6 contigs. The 156F6 BAC clone, however, did not overlap with the

325

626B1 contigs. Although, the BWA-MEM alignment showed high similarity between the two

326

BAC ends (S3 Fig.), the NCBI BLAST revealed that the similarity was due to the presence of

327

NLR homologous sequences of truncated genes on the tested scaffolds, while their very ends

328

were different.

329

Based on DNA sequence comparison to the annotated Phureja genome and searches in

330

the NCBI database, eight genes were assigned to the NLR family. Seven NLR genes were

331

located on the BAC clone 156F6 and one on 626B1. NLR genes can be divided into two

332

subclasses: one includes genes whose proteins contain a coiled-coil (CC) motif at their N-

333

terminus, and the other includes genes whose proteins resemble the Toll-interleukin receptor

334

(TIR) domain at the N-terminus [10]. One out of the eight NLR genes that we identified was a

335

CC-type disease resistance gene encoding a protein 97% identical to the predicted disease

336

resistance RPP8-like protein 2 of potato (S6 Fig.). Since this gene carried the DisRes marker

337

we kept the name DisRes for the RPP8-like gene located on BAC clone 156F6. The other

338

seven putative resistance genes belonged to the TIR-type NLR genes. These included four

339

genes encoding proteins similar to the phloem protein A5-like. Nevertheless, one out of the

340

four genes that we identified (Phloem3) may not be functional because it encodes an N-

341

terminal-truncated protein and involves four stop codons. The other three genes, Phloem 1, 2

342

and 4, encoded 77-87% identical proteins (S7 Fig.). The other three TIR-type NLR genes were

343

similar to the N-like TMV resistance gene isolated from tobacco (S8 Fig.). Thus, these genes

344

were designated TMV1, TMV2 and TMV3. The predicted proteins TMV2 and TMV3

345

possessed 80% identity at the amino acid sequence level. TMV1, however, similar to

346

Phloem3, may not be functional because it encodes an N-terminal-truncated protein (S8 Fig.).

347

Vidal et al. [17] cloned and characterised Y-1 that co-segregated with Ryadg, a gene for

348

ER to PVY on chromosome XI and found it also structurally similar to the N-like TMV

349

resistance gene isolated from tobacco. Therefore, we tested the similarities between Y-1 and

350

the TMVs isolated from ‘White Lady’. The highest identity, 42%, was detected between Y-1

351

and TMV2 (S9 Fig.). Recently, Grech-Baran et al. [42] published the genomic sequence of a

352

TIR-NLR immune receptor identified as Rysto in a dihaploid clone of the cultivar “Alicja”,

353

which has PVY resistance also from S. stoloniferum in its ancestry. Comparison of the two

354

genomic sequences from the putative start and stop codons of the genes revealed 95% identity

355

between TMV2 and Rysto (S10 Fig.).

potato cultivars ‘Désirée’ and ‘S440’. Six genes of interest with 0.4-1.9 kb untranslated 5’

362

regions were PCR-amplified with a high fidelity DNA polymerase and inserted into pBin19.

363

TMV2, TMV3 and DisRes were cloned separately, resulting in the constructs T2, T3 and DR,

364

while Phloem genes were cloned in pairs, resulting in the constructs P1-2 and P3-4 (Fig 4).

377

derived from the transformation with P1-2 and P3-4 each, and 20, 24 and 30 plants from the

378

transformation with TMV2, TMV3 and DisRes, respectively, were isolated. To test for the

379

presence of ‘White Lady’-derived genes in the putative transgenic plants gene-specific

380

primers were developed (Table 1 and Fig. 5). DNA was isolated from in vitro grown P1-2,

381

P3-4, DR and T3 plants and the gene-specific primers were used for PCR amplification of

382

NLR fragments. In this way, 10 P1-2, 12 P3-4, 27 DR and 18 T3 lines were selected. In the

383

case of TMV2 no primer pair distinguishing between the corresponding ‘White Lady’ and

384

‘Désirée’ gene could be identified. Nevertheless, with a primer pair designed for TMV2 cDNA

385

(Table 1) a difference in expression level of the gene was detected (Fig. 6). Thus in the case

386

of T2 lines, RNA was isolated from the leaves, and RT-PCR was used to identify the 17

387

‘Désirée’ transgenic lines expressing TMV2. Attempts were made to detect the expression of

388

the other transgenes as well, however, due to the high level of homology (S6,7 Fig.) no

389

cultivar-specific primers for the phloem protein-like and DisRes transcripts could be designed,

390

while in the case of TMV3 the level of expression was very low even in ‘White Lady’.

Discussion

423
424

The Rysto gene from S. stoloniferum was originally introgressed into the widely used

425

breeding clone MPI 61.303/34. Rysto-based virus resistance has proven quite durable and is

426

used in breeding programmes throughout the world. For example, this gene provides

427

resistance against several viruses in the cultivars ‘Bzura’, ‘Forelle’, ‘Pirola’, and ‘White

428

Lady’ [43], the last of which is the object of this study.

429

Our result supported the previous finding [16] that the Rysto gene in ‘White Lady’ is

430

located on chromosome XII and linked to STM0003 and YES3-3A, the markers widely used

431

for marker-assisted selection in breeding programmes [44,45]. Because Ry-fsto mapped by Flis

432

et al. [14] and Song et al. [15] is also linked to STM0003 and YES3-3A, there is a possibility

433

that the Rysto gene in ‘White Lady’ and Ry-fsto have the same source.

434

In addition to the abovementioned publications, some other studies also supported the

435

location of Rysto on the distal end of chromosome XII [21,46,47]. To the best of our

436

knowledge, however, the genetic map presented in Fig. 2 is the most detailed map of the Rysto

437

locus published so far. Sequencing the PCR fragments of ‘White Lady’ generated by ST1 and

438

YES3-3A primers identified two supercontigs as a putative region surrounding Rysto and

439

resulted in the isolation of a new marker, SGN-U256066, located between STM0003 and

440

YES3-3A. Combining the genetic map with genomic sequence data of the S. tuberosum

441

Group Phureja, the size of the Rysto locus was narrowed down to approximately 1 Mb. BAC

442

clones of ‘White Lady’ overlapping the Rysto locus were isolated by chromosome walking.

443

Markers 1.365, 1.156, 1.110 and 1.109 were designed to the BAC clone ends and used in

444

walking. For the identification of two additional markers, Sec15 and DisRes, the intron

445

targeting (IT) method was applied. This method is based on the observation that intron

446

sequences are generally less conserved than exons, and they display polymorphism due to

447

length and/or nucleotide variation in their alleles. Effective strategies for exploiting this

448

information and generating IT markers have already been developed and successfully applied

449

for many plant species, including potato [31,48].

450

By annotating the Rysto locus sequence, one putative CC-type and seven TIR-type NLR

451

genes were identified, of which five appeared to encode full-length proteins. A genome-wide

452

genetic mapping of NLR disease resistance loci in the diploid potato clone RH89-039-16 (S.

453

tuberosum ssp. tuberosum) resulted in the detection of 738 partial- and full-length resistance

454

gene homologues [46]. A very similar result was obtained by resistance gene enrichment

455

sequencing (RenSeq), which detected 755 NLRs in the sequenced S. tuberosum genome [49].

456

Nevertheless, the function of most of these genes is unknown. In our case, however, the CC-

457

type NLR was similar to RPP8, a gene of Arabidopsis thaliana providing resistance to

458

Peronospora parasitica [50]. In addition, three genes encoding full-length proteins similar to

459

phloem protein A5-like were identified. It was shown earlier that many phloem proteins have

460

roles in wound and defence responses [51]. Two genes encoding full-length proteins were

461

similar to TMV resistance proteins in tobacco [52] and Y-1 characterising an ER with S.

462

andigena origin in potato [17]. One of these genes, TMV2, showed 95% identity with the

463

recently isolated Rysto gene of the dihalpoid clone dH ‘Alicja’ at genomic DNA sequence

464

level [42].

465

Implication of the CC-type NLR gene DisRes and the five TIR-type NLR genes,

466

Phloem 1, 2, 4 and TMV2, 3, in ER was tested by introducing the genes into the PVY-

467

sensitive potato cultivar ‘Désirée’ and expressing the genes using their own putative

468

promoter. The presence of the NLR genes derived from ‘White Lady’ was demonstrated in

469

transgenic lines selected for virus resistance testing; however, the expression of TMV2 only

470

could be tested in transgenic plants due to the absence of phloem protein-like and DisRes

471

cDNA-specific primers and the very low level of expression of TMV3 in ‘White Lady’. None

472

of the transgenic lines, however, became PVYNTN resistant. A similar result was obtained by

473

[17] while testing Y-1, the gene that co-segregated with the ER gene Ryadg. The transgenic

474

potato plants of line v2-134 expressing Y-1 under the control of CaMV-35S promoter

475

developed necrotic lesions upon infection with PVYO, but no significant resistance was

476

observed, and plants were systemically infected with the virus. Thus, it was hypothesised that

477

the function of Y-1 is merely to cause a PVY-specific cell death response.

478

In contrast, introduction and expression of a TIR-NLR gene derived from ‘Alicja’ and

479

mapped to the same 58-59-Mbp region of chromosome XII as the TIR-NLR genes we

480

identified transferred ER to two sensitive potato cultivars, ‘Russet Burbank’ and ‘Maris

481

Piper’. This gene, which was identified as Rysto in ‘Alicja’ [42], is 95% identical with TMV2

482

in ‘White Lady’ at genomic sequence level. Even the primer pair used to clone Rysto from

483

‘Alicja’ may be suitable for cloning TMV2 from ‘White Lady’ (S10 Fig.). Therefore, it is

484

highly probable that TMV2 is the Rysto gene in ‘White Lady’. Nevertheless, expression of

485

TMV2 did not confer ER neither to transgenic ‘Désirée’ nor to ‘S440’ lines. Although a high-

486

fidelity DNA polymerase was used to amplify TMV2 from the ‘White Lady’ genome a

487

mismatch caused by the enzyme could result in the loss of function of the gene. An alternative

488

explanation might be the high frequency of chimera formation generated by Agrobacterium-

489

mediated transformation and regeneration from calluses [53]. Since a slightly different

490

transformation technique was used by Grech-Baran et al. [42] and us, and the frequency of

491

chimera formation may be different in various potato cultivars, these factors could result in a

492

difference in the frequency of chimera formation. Since chimeras have untransformed cells

493

the viruses could spread and multiply in these cells masking the resistant phenotype of the

494

transgenic cells when testing the plants for the presence of the virus by RT-PCR. It should be

495

noted, however, that based on DNA sequence analysis there is a gap between the BAC clones

496

156F6 and 626B1 in our map. Thus, the presence of a functional gene corresponding to Rysto

497

and located in the uncovered region cannot be excluded either.

498

Marker-assisted selection (MAS) has already been routinely employed in crop

499

breeding programmes to accelerate cultivar development. With selection for virus resistance

500

in the juvenile phase and parental selection prior to crossing, breeding time and costs can be

501

reduced. In this work, we discovered five new markers very tightly linked to Rysto, which

502

showed polymorphism between the Rysto bearing potato cv. ‘White Lady’ and the virus

503

sensitive ‘Désirée’ and ‘S440’ (Fig. 5 and 6). In addition to the markers identified earlier,

504

these markers can serve potato breeding efforts for extreme virus resistance.
