Abstract

23

Forests are a mosaic of light spectra, and colour signal efficiency might change in

24

different light environments. Local adaptation in Heliconius butterflies is linked to

25

microhabitat use and the colourful wing colour patterns may also be adapted for signalling

26

in different light environments. These butterflies exhibit conspicuous colours as a

27

warning to predators that they are toxic and should be avoided, but also find and choose

28

potential mates based on colour signals. The two selection pressures of predation and

29

mate preference are therefore acting together. In this study we analysed the contrast of

30

two Heliconius mimicry rings in their natural habitats under varying degrees of forest

31

fragmentation and light conditions. We used digital image analyses and mapped the bird

32

and butterfly vision colour space in order to examine whether warning colours have

33

greater contrast and if they transmit a consistent signal across time of the day and habitat

34

in a tropical forest. We tested conspicuousness using opponent colour channels against a

35

natural green background. For avian vision, colours are generally very stable through time

36

and habitat. For butterfly vision, there is some evidence that species are more contrasting

37

in their own habitats, where conspicuousness is higher for red and yellow bands in the

38

border and for white in the forest. Light environment affects Heliconius butterflies’

39

warning signal transmission to a higher degree through their own vision, but to a lesser

40

degree through avian predator vision. This work provides insight into the use of colour

41

signals in sexual and natural selection in the light of ecological adaptation.

Introduction

53

The success of a signal is related to its effectiveness in a specific environment and

54

how strongly it influences the behaviour of the receiver (Endler 1978). Forests are a

55

mosaic of light colours, and the same colour pattern can have an altered appearance in

56

different light environments (Endler 1993). If an individual shows high reflectance of a

57

specific wavelength, but the environment lacks light in that part of the spectrum, the

58

region of high reflection will be unimportant as a signal (Stevens et al. 2007). Ambient

59

light spectra also vary from dawn to dusk, hence species that signal only at certain times

60

and places are expected to evolve characteristics and predictable combinations of colours

61

for particular environments (Endler 1993). Therefore, ambient light characteristics should

62

be included together with the receiver visual system to understand the microhabitat choice

63

and behaviour of animals.

64

Signals depend on the habitat where animals live in, since light conditions can

65

alter colour perception by filtering wavelengths and altering visual backgrounds (Endler

66

1993; Lovell et al. 2005). Sensory drive explains the process of adaptation of signalling

67

and sensory systems to the local environment (Endler 1992; Endler and Basolo 1998).

68

Environment tuned spectral sensitivity is better known in aquatic habitats, such as in

69

guppies (Endler 1980) and cichlid fish (Seehausen et al. 2008), as compared to terrestrial

70

light environments. On land, colour depends on the reflection of the surroundings and has

71

greater variability over time (Boughman 2002). Habitat signal transmission can favour

72

diversification of mating signals through local adaptation, leading to reproductive

73

isolation. Distinct Anolis lizards male dewlaps are found in different microhabitats

74

(Fleishman et al. 1997). Male dewlap colours are more conspicuous in their own habitat

75

than in other habitats, mainly because of the contrast against the background in the

76

ultraviolet (UV) range (Leal and Fleishman 2002). Perception of colours in different light

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/662155; this version posted June 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

77

conditions can also influence attacks by predators, for example among butterflies in an

78

environment with high UV light, birds aimed at the butterfly wings, more specifically the

79

marginal white eyespots that have UV reflectance, instead of the head (Olofsson et al.

80

2010).

81

Local adaptation in Heliconius butterflies commonly involves adaptation to

82

specific microhabitat use (Estrada and Jiggins 2002; Elias et al. 2008; Jiggins 2008).

83

Mimicry rings are groups of unpalatable species that share the same warning colour, and

84

these tend to be found in different microhabitats such as forest or open areas. The

85

Heliconius habitats are associated with the use of larval host-plants, adult food plants,

86

sexual behaviour and gregarious roosting (Mallet and Gilbert 1995). Species that lay eggs

87

on Passiflora species that occur in second growth tend to be seen in open areas, while

88

species that lay eggs on canopy Passiflora vines are seen flying high in the forest. The

89

choice of microhabitat also might be connected with light differences between those

90

environments, such as the choice of using shady areas in communal roosting (Mallet and

91

Gilbert 1995; Finkbeiner 2014).

92

Therefore, different light environments should create microhabitats where

93

butterfly signals would be more efficient. Although mimicry rings differ in their

94

microhabitat, the light environment has not been measured to verify whether colour

95

patterns could be specifically adapted to particular light environments. The colourful

96

wing colours of Heliconius butterflies may also be subject to evolution caused by sensory

97

drive due to their potentially conflicting roles in predation and mate preference. Many

98

species exhibit Müllerian mimicry (Müller 1879), in which two or more species share the

99

same conspicuous colour as a warning to predators that they are toxic and should be

100

avoided (Benson 1972). Also, these butterflies find and choose potential mates based on

101

colour signals, which can lead to reproductive isolation (Jiggins et al. 2001; Sweeney et

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/662155; this version posted June 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

102

al. 2003; Kronforst et al. 2006). Furthermore, communication between conspecifics might

103

be based on UV signals, since H. erato females express the duplicate UV opsin gene,

104

which allows a greater degree of discrimination of the UV-yellow wing patches (Briscoe

105

et al. 2010; Bybee et al. 2012; McCulloch et al. 2016; Dell’Aglio et al. 2018).

106

This microhabitat structuring allows mimicry rings to remain distinct. This may

107

be because there are sets of predators in different habitats, each of which perceive a

108

different mimicry ring as the most abundant pattern (Joron and Mallet 1998). Although

109

little is known of the specific predators that attack Heliconius, it seems likely that their

110

aposematic signals are directed at several predators with different visual abilities and

111

spectral sensitivities (Dell’Aglio et al. 2018). Ambient light together with predator

112

sensitivity can interfere with the interpretation of the information perceived from colour

113

signals.

114

Warning coloration should, therefore, be easy to detect and memorize even in

115

heterogeneous environments and light conditions (Guilford and Dawkins 1991; Endler

116

1992). Warning signals are often dominated by red, yellow and orange, frequently

117

contrasting with black, which are the main colours in Heliconius. The reason why these

118

long-wavelength colours are widely represented in aposematic coloration is that they are

119

highly conspicuous against natural backgrounds, are more stable across light conditions,

120

allowing long distance discrimination and detectability, and influence memorability

121

(Guilford and Dawkins 1991; Stevens and Ruxton 2012; Arenas et al. 2014; Dell’Aglio

122

et al. 2016).

123

Perception of colour depends on several neurophysiological mechanisms, such as

124

the presence of opponent colour channels. This chromatic mechanism involves

125

comparisons of receptors outputs, in which opposite neural pathways are either activated

126

or inhibited depending on the stimuli reaching the eye (Kelber et al. 2003; Renoult et al.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/662155; this version posted June 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

127

2015). This mechanism is useful especially regarding colour stability against spatial and

128

temporal variation in illumination (Lovell et al. 2005; Renoult et al. 2015). For example

129

birds, the major predator of aposematic butterflies, have tetrachromatic vision and

130

seemingly have at least three opponent channels, as found in domestic chicks (Vorobyev

131

et al. 1998; Osorio et al. 1999). Opponent channels have also been described for insects

132

(Chittka et al. 1992; Chittka 1996) and butterflies (Kelber 1999), and have been

133

hypothesized for Heliconius butterflies although more behavioural analyses are needed

134

to confirm which opponent channels are actually used (Swihart 1971, 1972; Bybee et al.

135

2012). Butterflies in the genus Papilio have duplicate LW opsin genes to see in the red

136

and green range (Kelber 1999; Briscoe 2008), while Heliconius has only one LW opsin

137

to see red and green, and differences in sensitivity are associated with the presence of red

138

filtering pigments in the ommatidia (Zaccardi et al. 2006; McCulloch et al. 2016). Thus,

139

we expect avian predators and butterflies to rely on these high-contrast systems to process

140

information under a changing light environment.

141

The aim of this study was to analyse Heliconius warning colouration under

142

different light conditions in their natural habitats. In particular, to test conspicuousness of

143

the wing colouration against a natural green background, encoded by opponent colour

144

channels. Using digital image analyses, butterfly wings were photographed and mapped

145

to UVS and VS avian predator vision and to Heliconius erato vision (Figure 1). Our

146

predictions are that (1) signal contrast and conspicuousness for avian predators should

147

have constancy, that should be stable throughout the day and in different light

148

environments (Stevens and Ruxton 2012; Arenas et al. 2014). Warning signals might be

149

honest indicators of prey unprofitability to predators, and if signals fluctuate through the

150

day and between light environments, we would predict that this could delay learning by

151

predators and be costly to the prey. Similarly for internal contrasts (i.e. contrast between

152

black and the coloured bands), therefore conspicuousness would not rely totally on

153

background contrast but also on internal patterns which account for close-distance

154

conspicuousness (Endler 1978; Aronsson and Gamberale-Stille 2009). (2) From a

155

Heliconius butterfly perspective; we predict that signal contrast and conspicuousness

156

should show habitat-specific maximum background contrast and higher colour

157

differences in their own habitats (Table 1), which would facilitate detection and species

158

identification. We therefore predict that selection for signal constancy will be much

159

stronger in the avian visual system as compared to the butterfly visual system.

Material and Methods

175

Study site and species

176

Fieldwork was performed during the dry season, along Pipeline Road, a tropical

177

lowland rainforest in the Panama Canal Zone (Parque Nacional Soberanía, 9º7’33”N,

178

79º42’90”W). Pipeline Road makes a transect through the forest, creating a

179

heterogeneous habitat with open sunny areas and close canopy exceeding 30 m in height.

180

All specimens were collected in the area. Two pairs of co-mimics that live in sympatry

181

were selected, H. erato demophoon (n = 8) and H. melpomene rosina (n = 8), H. sapho

182

(n = 5) and H. cydno (n = 5), belonging to two different mimicry rings, red and yellow,

183

and white, respectively (Figure 1 and Table 1).

184
185

Digital photography

186

The general approach and methodology for this work was based on previous work

187

with colour stability using opponent signals (Lovell et al. 2005; Arenas et al. 2014). The

188

spectral reflectance of mimetic pairs was investigated using digital photography. This

189

provides a way to control for natural variation in luminance intensity (shadowing) that is

190

not captured by spectrometry, and also allows non-invasive colour measurements easily

191

applied in the field (Stevens et al. 2007; Troscianko and Stevens 2015). Therefore,

192

through this method we could obtain colour measures under the sensitivity of all receiver

193

photoreceptors (300-700 nm) in the actual viewing conditions of conspecifics and avian

194

predators.

195

Fresh wings of each specimen were photographed following the same methods of

196

image collection in Dell’Aglio et al. (2018). The camera was fitted to a tripod and pointed

197

towards the ground (90º) at a height of approximately 80 cm. Each photo setup included

198

two individuals, one of each species of the co-mimic pair, a 40% grey standard

199

(Spectralon® Labsphere) used for calibration and a leaf freshly collected to make

200

background measures. The species used was Guazuma ulmifolia (Sterculiaceae), a small

201

abundant shrub across all Pipeline Road, which facilitated the collection of fresh leaves.

202

Photos were taken under three different arboreal canopy conditions, forest border,

203

closed forest, and open area, where those butterflies are usually seen (Table 1). All photos

204

were taken under sunny to part-cloudy days, with three replicates in each habitat making

205

sure that the amount of light was similar. In order to standardize the replicates, light

206

measures were taken with a digital light meter (Digital Lux meter, Tondaj LX-1010B),

207

which measures the total amount of LW (555 nm) per square meter (Lux) (Figure 2). Also

208

photographs of the canopy were taken in order to measure vegetative cover, which was

209

81.5% (SE ± 0.2) for closed forest, 59.8 % (SE ± 3.4) for forest border, and 0% for open

210

area. The aim was to analyze how colour signals are perceived throughout the morning

211

when butterflies are most active. Therefore, photos were taken at dawn (7 am), morning

212

(9 am) and noon (12 pm) during a short period of 15min as light conditions change

213

rapidly. Open area photographs were taken only at 12 pm because of high sunlight

214

incidence (Figure 2) and to represent a highly used environment by butterflies at this

215

period of day.

Image analysis and visual modelling

224

All images were processed and analyzed into the imaging software ImageJ

225

(Rasband, 1997-2012). RAW human-visible and UV images were linearized and aligned

226

following the methodology of Troscianko and Stevens (2015) and Arenas et al. (2014).

227

Normally, photos would be normalized to the grey standard, which removes effects of

228

light conditions (Arenas et al. 2014). Since our main interest was to measure how

229

coloration changes in different light environments, the images were not normalized.

230

Instead, an average grey standard value was obtained from all photographs. Photon catch

231

values were obtained for each colour using the entire patch from linearized photos, and

232

subsequently these values were multiplied by each photo exposure time and normalized

233

with the average grey standard. With this methodology we were able to calculate how

234

particular environment and time varies from the natural average light, and also assume

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/662155; this version posted June 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

235

colour constancy, a neural mechanism that compensates for changes in illumination

236

(Stevens et al. 2007; Arenas et al. 2014). We used the average photon catch results from

237

the three habitats replicates. Predicted photon catch values were obtained using spectral

238

sensitivity for each cone type of the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) for the UV-sensitive

239

vision (UVS) (Hart et al. 2000), peafowl (Pavo cristatus) for the violet-sensitive vision

240

(VS) (Hart 2002) and Heliconius erato (Briscoe et al. 2010; McCulloch et al. 2016).

241

Background of many terrestrial habitats is dominated by greenish vegetation;

242

therefore, a green leaf was chosen to make contrast calculations. Differences between

243

light environment and time of the day were calculated using the contrast of warning

244

colours against an average green leaf. Channel activation in avian vision was calculated

245

using the Red-Green (RG), Blue-Yellow (BY) and Blue-UV opponent channel (Osorio et

246

al. 1999; Lovell et al. 2005; Stevens et al. 2009). For the achromatic signal, we used avian

247

double cones (DBL). Using a ratio-based approach suggested by Lovell et al. (2005), we

248

calculated the opponent channel responses as follows:

249

RG = LW – MW / LW + MW

250

BY = SW – (LW + MW) / SW + (LW + MW)

251

Blue-UV = SW – UV / SW + UV

252

Achromatic = DBL

253

Opponent channels for Heliconius were based on existing bird opponent channels

254

and on what has been proposed in earlier studies (Swihart 1971, 1972; Bybee et al. 2012).

255

The H. erato compound eye has red filtering pigments that shift LW photoreceptor

256

sensitivity from green to red and as the physiological mechanisms underlying these two

257

LW photoreceptors are not known, sensitivities in Green (560 nm) and Red (600 nm)

258

were used (McCulloch et al. 2016, 2017). To investigate differences between co-mimic

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/662155; this version posted June 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

259

species, we calculated opponent channel activation based on the prediction that

260

Heliconius mating system might use UV2-UV1 and RG contrasts for mate choice (Bybee

261

et al. 2012; McCulloch et al. 2016, 2017). Channel activation in Heliconius vision was

262

calculated using the opponent channels as follows:

263

RG = Red – Green / Red + Green

264

BY = Blue – (Red + Green) / Blue + (Red + Green)

265

Blue-UV2 = Blue – UV2 / Blue + UV2

266

UV2-UV1 = UV2 – UV1 / UV2 + UV1

267

To examine whether warning colours have greater contrast against green

268

background we calculated the Weber Contrast (Whittle 1994), which takes into account

269

the image value of the objects of interest as a fraction of background appearance using

270

the formula:
C = (object − background) / background

271
272

Where background corresponds to the green leaf opponent channel values, and

273

object corresponds to warning colour opponent channel values. This measure is suited to

274

comparisons between small objects against larger backgrounds, such as butterflies against

275

the green forest. For internal contrast, achromatic values of the warning colours were used

276

against the black of each individual wing as background (Arenas et al. 2014). We plotted

277

the mean absolute contrast of each colour signal as a function of time and light

278

environment for the three vision models.

279
280

Statistical analyses

281

All statistical calculations were processed in the software R 3.5.3 (R Core Team

282

2019). Our approach was to model colour contrasts over the course of a day and under

283

different habitats in term of both predator and butterfly vision. Normality tests showed

284

that contrast data were not normally distributed, therefore data were transformed to

285

normality using square-root transformation and the transformed data were used in all

286

statistical analyses. Raw data was plotted to illustrate the results. To test our predictions,

287

general linear mixed models were performed using Satterthwaite approximations with

288

random effects (packages lme4 and lmerTest) and Tukey’s post-hoc (package multicomp).

289

The models were fitted accordingly to the predictions outlined above. Analyses were

290

carried out using contrast values as the dependent variable, and fixed and random factors

291

varied depending on the question. Factors were individuals, colour (red, yellow, white),

292

habitat (border, forest, area), time (7am, 9am, 12pm), and bird vision (UVS, VS). For

293

Heliconius vision, we also added side of the wing (dorsal, ventral) because this trait might

294

be more important for butterflies than for their avian predators.

295
296

Results

297

Signal contrast and conspicuousness for avian predators

298

Red was generally the most contrasting colour against a green background in the

299

RG opponent channel as compared to yellow (z = -11.10, P < 0.001, Table S1) and white

300

(z = -18.0, P < 0.001, Table S1). In contrast, white had higher contrasts against a green

301

background in the BY channel, as compared to red (z = 22.88, P < 0.001, Table S1) and

302

yellow (z = -31.47, P < 0.001, Table S1) (Figure 3). Colours in open areas showed a

304

no difference between border and forest (z = -0.31, P = 0.94, Table S2) (Figure 3). In the

305

Blue-UV opponent channel, UVS and VS birds could perceive red and yellow with less

306

stability, and yellow showed higher contrast early in the morning than at noon (7 am: z =

307

12.15, P < 0.001; 9 am: z = 14.24, P < 0.001, Table S3).

308

Internal achromatic contrast was higher for yellow, compared to red (z = 41.89, P

309

< 0.001, Table S1) and white (z = 12.42, P < 0.001, Table S1). Moreover, yellow has

310

more contrast in the border, which is the preferred habitat of yellow band butterflies, than

311

in the forest (z = -3.42, P = 0.001, Table S4) (Figure 3).

Signal contrast and conspicuousness for Heliconius conspecifics

314

In some cases, contrasts followed our prediction that species would be more

315

contrasting in their own habitats (Figure 4). The yellow colour was more contrasting in

316

the border in the UV2-UV1 channel, especially early hours such as 7 am (t = -23.1, P <

317

0.001, Table S5) and 9 am (t = -13.3, P < 0.001, Table S5). White was more contrasting

318

in the forest than in the border at 7 am in the UV2-UV1 channel (t = 2.32, P = 0.014,

319

Table S5) and also at 7 am in the Blue-UV2 channel (t = 6.12, P < 0.001, Table S5). Also,

320

in the Blue-UV2 channel, while white colour contrast decreased during the day in the

321

forest, it increased at 12 pm in the border (z = -4.11, P < 0.001, Table S5) (Figure 4). The

322

red colour showed large differences in the RG channel between dorsal and ventral side,

323

with dorsal side with the higher contrast (t = -40.04, P < 0.001, Table S6). Same results

324

were found for red in the Blue-Yellow and Blue-UV2 opponent channel (Table S6)

325

(Figure 4).

Discussion

347

The bright and contrasting Heliconius wing patterns appear well adapted for

348

signalling distastefulness to predators. However, their colour constancy and appearance

349

in different light environments remains poorly studied. Here we have shown that colours

350

are indeed very stable for avian predator vision, but somewhat less so for Heliconius

351

vision. This is consistent with the idea that wing patterns are primarily selected for their

352

role in signalling distastefulness to predators.

353
354

Signal stability and conspicuousness to avian predators

355

Generally, warning signals involve combinations of long-wavelength colours such

356

as red, orange, and yellow which are highly conspicuous against natural backgrounds and

357

stable under different natural conditions (Lovell et al. 2005; Stevens and Ruxton 2012).

358

In our results, Heliconius red colouration has higher detectability against average green

359

background in the RG output and these results are consistent regardless of habitat and

360

time of the day. Previous work has investigated colour stability through opponent colour

361

channels and also showed that red coloration is more contrasting and stable against green

362

backgrounds over the course of a day and across light conditions to the bird visual system

363

(Lovell et al. 2005; Arenas et al. 2014). Moreover, the Heliconius yellow colouration also

364

is highly conspicuous against its internal black pattern in the achromatic output.

365

Achromatic information is one of the main cues used for motion detection (Hämäläinen

366

et al. 2015). Therefore, our results suggest that red and yellow signals work together and

367

are likely effective in stimulating avian opponent channels in order to be conspicuous in

368

all light environments.

369

There is evidence that red and yellow colouration serve as reliable warning signal

370

to avian predators (Ham et al. 2006; Svádová et al. 2009; Arenas et al. 2015), but that this

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/662155; this version posted June 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

371

is less true of white colouration. One explanation is that white is more variable across

372

time and habitat, so provides a less reliable signal under varied light conditions (Stevens

373

and Ruxton 2012; Arenas et al. 2014). As an example, field and aviary experiments with

374

polymorphic yellow and white wood tiger moths, Parasemia plantaginis, showed that

375

yellow males are avoided more than white males by predators, but white males have

376

higher mating success (Nokelainen et al. 2012). Our results showed that white contrasts

377

against green background were lower and rather variable for avian vision. The co-mimics

378

H. sapho and H. cydno also contain iridescence blue that was not measured with this

379

methodology. However, the lack of high contrast in white colouration might be balanced

380

with the fact that polarized light might act as a signal, especially in forest habitats

381

(Sweeney et al. 2003; Douglas et al. 2007; Pegram et al. 2015).

382

Highly conspicuous warning signals are expected to evolve to be stable in their

383

appearance throughout the day and between light environments, in order to remain honest

384

indicators of prey unpalatability (Blount et al. 2009; Cortesi and Cheney 2010; Stevens

385

and Ruxton 2012; Arenas et al. 2015). If warning signals fluctuate through time and space

386

this could alter bird foraging experiences and reduce the effectiveness of the aposematic

387

signal. The final decision on whether or not to attack a prey results from a combination

388

of information reaching the predator brain, and for greater efficiency, aposematic

389

coloration needs to be easy to remember (Endler 1988). Our results support this

390

prediction, as colours were generally stable through time and light environments in all

391

opponent systems with only a few exceptions. Notably these occurred where contrasts

392

were higher in open areas and in the early morning. This might also be favourable as the

393

prey would be more conspicuous when they are most vulnerable to predation, since birds

394

are more active and forage early in the morning (Buskirk et al. 1972; Poulin et al. 2001;

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/662155; this version posted June 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

395

Steiger et al. 2009). In agreement with this, Heliconius predation and roost disturbance

396

has been observed in the early morning (Mallet 1986; Finkbeiner 2014).

397
398

Habitat and time influence conspicuousness in Heliconius conspecifics

399

Butterflies belonging to the two mimetic rings studied here tend to be segregated

400

between habitats, corresponding to areas where the photographs were taken, although

401

there is considerable overlap (Estrada and Jiggins 2002). We showed that the colours

402

were more unstable when seen through Heliconius vision as compared to avian vision and

403

some colours tend to be more contrasting in their respective habitats.

404

Our results provide some evidence that co-mimic rings are more conspicuous in

405

their own habitat as seen through Heliconius vision, reinforcing the idea that ecological

406

adaptation leads to spatial segregation to where detection would be facilitated. Some

407

colours had higher contrast against green backgrounds in their respective habitat, such as

408

yellow in the border and white in the forest. Nonetheless, red showed the opposite trend

409

and was generally more contrasting in the forest. Differences across light environments

410

could affect mating preferences by altering search costs for a specific colour pattern, and

411

perhaps changing the fitness of different colour patterns. Adaptation in different

412

microhabitats within the forest might have an influence on how closely related species

413

commonly differ in pattern, while convergence in pattern occurs between more distantly

414

related species (Joron and Mallet 1998). Ecological adaptation is attributed to habitat

415

preference and leads to assortative mating (Jiggins 2008). The two sister species studied

416

here, H. melpomene rosina and H. cydno, are known to rarely hybridise in the wild, hence

417

microhabitat segregation reduces potential mating encounters between these two species

418

and reduces gene flow (Mallet et al. 1998; Merrill et al. 2013). Subtle environmental

419

conditions could affect recognition in mating behaviour as seen in the jumping spider,

420

Habronattus pyrrithrix, which red males were more successful in approaching females in

421

the sunlight (Taylor and McGraw 2013).

422

The activation of opponent channels was often higher in the early hours of the

423

morning, at the time when the butterflies are more active and leave their roost or perches

424

to forage (Mallet 1986; Finkbeiner et al. 2012). This was especially the case for

425

Heliconius white and yellow wing colours in the UV channel, which might act in

426

intraspecific communication (Briscoe et al. 2010; Bybee et al. 2012). There is evidence

427

that distinct UV colour signals are being transmitted between co-mimics, which may

428

reduce costs of mating confusion (Dell’Aglio et al. 2018). Similarly, in two species of

429

newt, belly colour is distinct in the UV range and females often made mistakes choosing

430

the wrong males in the absence of UV light (Secondi and Théry 2014).

431

In this context, the duplicate genes encoding two distinct visual pigments with

432

sensitivity peaks in the UV range in H. erato females offer the potential for enhanced

433

spectral discrimination in light environments and time of the day where UV is more

434

prominent. A UV2-UV1 opponent channel was proposed by Bybee et al. (2012), who

435

showed that this receptor combination would have lower error rates for discrimination

436

between Heliconius and Dryas yellows. There is no direct evidence for such a mechanism

437

yet, but the fact that males and females show differences in the expression of the two UV

438

proteins suggests that UV2-UV1 contrasts could be an important opponent channel for a

439

female specific behaviour, perhaps mate recognition or host plant finding (McCulloch et

440

al. 2016, 2017). There is similarly no direct evidence for a Red-Green opponent channel,

441

although the presence of red filters in their eyes means that this is a possibility

442

(McCulloch et al. 2016). Differences between species in Red-Green channel activity for

443

red colouration might have a role in mate recognition since Heliconius tend to be attracted

444

to red (Merrill et al. 2011).

445

The sensory drive hypothesis describes evolutionary relationships among visual

446

systems, conditions of the light environment and mating preferences (Endler and Basolo

447

1998). Heliconius mating preference is highly linked to colour and in H. melpomene, the

448

gene responsible for red colour pattern is genetically linked to the preference for the same

449

pattern (Jiggins et al. 2001; Naisbit et al. 2001; Merrill et al. 2011). Visual sensitivity data

450

used here is only from H. erato whereas it might differ for other species in their visual

451

systems and perhaps match with colour preference or habitat (Frentiu et al. 2007; Briscoe

452

et al. 2010; McCulloch et al. 2017). In addition, mating behaviour might benefit from

453

some habitats in maximizing conspicuousness, such as in tropical dwelling birds and

454

wire-tailed manakins which visual contrast is increased during display by habitat choice

455

(Endler and Théry 1996; Heindl and Winkler 2003). Nevertheless, our results suggest that

456

selection for conspicuousness in the preferred habitat could explain in part the divergence

457

in colour pattern in these species.

458
459

Conclusion

460

In conclusion, the transmission of Heliconius warning signals varies due to light

461

environment to a much greater degree through their own visual system, but to a smaller

462

degree through avian predator vision. Selection for signal detectability under different

463

habitat conditions is a mechanism that is proposed to lead to evolution of signal diversity,

464

as seen in species of Anolis lizards that occupy habitats that match their visual system and

465

signal design (Leal and Fleishman 2002), in species of warblers which different cone

466

opsin gene expression correlate with sexual selection and habitat use (Bloch 2015) and

467

also colour patterns of guppies are more conspicuous to guppies at the times and places

468

of courtship and relatively less conspicuous at times and places of predator risk (Endler

469

1991). Heliconius butterfly warning colours are highly contrasting against the forest

470

background and stable through time and habitat in terms of predator avoidance but also

471

conspicuous to attract the attention of conspecifics. However, more extensive studies

472

considering spectral sensitivities of different Heliconius species and their responses to

473

environmental changes in their signal visibility are needed to confirm the

474

conspicuousness to mates. Opponent channel colour contrasts can predict behaviour of

475

perceivers, however, additional behavioural experiments on how light environment

476

influences prey detectability, such with poison frogs (Rojas et al. 2014), are necessary to

477

verify our results.
