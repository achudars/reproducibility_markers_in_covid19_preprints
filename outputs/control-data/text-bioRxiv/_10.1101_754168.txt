Abstract

19

Circadian rhythm is an endogenous, self-sustainable oscillation that participates in regulating

20

organisms’ physiological activities. Key to this oscillation is a negative feedback by main clock

21

components Periods and Cryptochromes that repress transcriptional activity of BMAL1/CLOCK

22

complexes. In addition, a novel repressor, CHRONO, has been identified recently, but details of

23

CHRONO’s function during repressing the circadian cycle remain unclear. Here we report that a

24

domain of CHRONO mainly composed of α-helixes is critical to repression through the

25

exploitation

26

co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, genome editing and structural information analysis

27

via circular dichroism spectroscopy. This repression is fulfilled by interactions between CHRONO

28

with a region on the BMAL1 C-terminus where Cryptochrome and CBP bind. Our results indicate

29

that CHRONO and PER differentially function as BMALA/CLOCK-dependent repressors. We

30

further suggest a repression model of how PER, CRY and CHRONO proteins associate with

31

BMAL1, respectively.

Introduction

Most organisms have evolved an endogenous circadian clock to adjust their metabolic

38

activities to anticipate daily environmental events, such as day/night switches or temperature

39

changes. In mammals, circadian clocks exist in almost every cell and organ. The clock

40

consists of a transcriptional and translational feedback loop (TTFL) in which transcription

41

factors brain and muscle arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1) and circadian locomotor output cycles

42

kaput (CLOCK) form hetero-dimer complexes (B/C complexes in the following text) and

43

then activate transcription of clock controlled genes (ccgs), including genes encoding PER

44

(PER1, and PER2, and PER3) and CRY proteins (CRY1, and CRY2) (1-3). After translation

45

and post-translational modifications, PERs and CRYs translocate into the nucleus to repress

46

BMAL1/CLOCK complex function (4,5). With such repression, a full clock cycle is

47

completed. A second loop composed of circadian components, such as rev-erb (6) and ror (7)

48

and their coding products is involved in regulating transcription of the arntl1 gene, which

49

encodes the BMAL1 protein. Other clock genes, such ascsnk1d, csnk1e, fblx21, and fblx3,

50

contribute to setting the clock speed (8-11) or in entraining the clockwork (12).

51

Recently, a novel clock gene was discovered using ChIP-seq (and computational analysis)

52

and subsequently analyzed in mammals. It was named ChIP-derived repressor of network

53

oscillator (chrono) (13), or computationally highlighted repressor of the network oscillator

54

(14), or circadian associated repressor of transcription (ciart) (15). chrono is under control of

55

the clock and its translation product, CHRONO (CHR in the following text), is reported to

56

repress transcriptional activating B/C complexes in a histone deacetylase (HDAC)- dependent

57

manner (13). chrono deficient mice had longer period of the locomotor activity, similar to

58

some other negative clock components such as cry, indicating it is a core circadian component

59

(14). In summary, negative components required to complete a full clock cycle include PERs,

60

CRYs, and CHR as well.

61

Negative repression is critical to the circadian clock and some means of repression have

62

been identified. First, repressors PERs (PER1 and PER2) were found to remove B/C

63

complexes from chromatin and then inactivate transcription (16,17). In contrast, ChIP assays

64

to map chromatin association by PERs indicated that PER forms large complexes on

65

chromatin during early repression phase (18,19). Studies revealed that PER2 and CRYs bind

66

to different domains of the BMAL1 protein in order to function as repressors (20). The

67

photolyase superfamily protein CRYs are more potent than PER proteins for repressing B/C

68

complexes (21, 22, 25). Partch lab demonstrated that besides binding to BMAL1, CRY1 also

69

associates with CLOCK as a repressor (24). During the repression phase, CRYs bind to B/C

70

complexes at the C terminus of BMAL1 on chromatin, sequestering the binding site from

71

transcriptional co-activators, CBP/p300 (25). Biochemical and cell-based complementation

72

assays suggest that an α-helical domain of CRY1 is required for feedback repression and that

73

the C-terminal domain of CRY1 is dispensable for complementation of the circadian clock in

74

cry1/cry2 double knockout cells (22). Repression of B/C complexes by CHR has been studied

75

and CHR is reported to be similar to CRY1 with regard to circadian clock regulation, via

76

interacting with the BMAL1 C terminus (23). Anafi et al. reported that CHR functioned at an

77

independent region from (but adjacent to) CRY proteins on the BMAL1 C terminus (14).

78

However, how repression during the cycle of the circadian clock happens remains unclear, for

79

example, how CHR fulfills its repressor role is elusive. We do not know which region of CHR

80

associates with BMAL1 or the structure of CHR. Thus, to understand how CHR represses

81

B/C complex transcriptional activity, we purified a predicted helical domain of the CHR

82

protein and extended helical domains. Then, we used circular dichroism spectroscopy to

83

confirm secondary structures. We found that the helical domain of CHR is necessary to

84

repress B/C complexes in vitro. Immunoprecipitation and Immunofluorescence revealed

85

interactions between the middle area of CHR containing rich α-helices and the C terminus of

86

BMAL1, indicating that CHR repressed B/C complexes via its middle area containing an

87

α-helix rich region. Collectively, characterizations of the helical domain of CHR tell us more

88

about how CHR represses B/C complex transcriptional activity, compared to the other two

89

negative components (PERs, CRYs).

Materials and Methods

93

Strains and Constructs

94

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to make constructs described in this study. Optimized

95

sequence coding for CHR-H and CHR-H3 were amplified and inserted into the V28-E4 plasmid

96

(from Dr. Ge lab, Anhui University) between NotⅠ and XhoⅠ restriction sites, resulting in a

97

maltose binding protein (MBP) tag and 6XHis tag fused to the 5’ and 3’ ends respectively.

98

MBP-CHRH (or H3) was expressed in the E. coil BL21 (DE3) strain. For the Luciferase reporter

99

assay, various versions of chrono as indicated in the text were cloned into pcDNA3.1(+)/Hygro

100

(Invitrogen, UntiedStates). For immunoprecipitation, sequence of 5Myc-6His-hBMAL1

101

(5M6HA1) was cloned and inserted into pcDNA3.1 via BmaHⅠ and EcoRⅠ sites (named

102

pcDNA3.1-5M6HA1 afterwards). And on the one hand, a series of chrono with cpVenus tag

103

followed sequences were cloned and inserted into pcDNA3.1(+)/Hygro plasmid between HindⅢ

104

and XhoⅠ sites, on the other hand, we built series of bmal1 with 5XMyc-6XHis-tag, using two

105

EcoRⅠ sites on the mutated pcDNA3.1

Site-directed Mutagenesis

108

To make L06A/L607A double mutations in the bmal1 coding region, the whole plasmid

114

were used for the mutagenesis. After the amplification, DpnⅠwas used to digest the template

115

plasmids. Then the product was transformed into the DH5α competent cells. To obtain the

116

site-directed mutagenesis plasmids, the plasmids from the transformed E.coli colonies were

Results

232

The helical domain of CHR represses the transcriptional activity of B/C complexes.

233

Since there were neither homologous proteins nor similar protein structures being reported,

234

assessment of CHR amino acid sequences was used to predict its secondary structure.

235

PredictProtein (27) and PSIPRED (28) were used to predict that CHR contains an α-helix rich

236

region in the middle (Fig. 1A) and both ends of CHR are flexible regions. Thus, CHR was

237

separated into three domains: the N-terminus (CHRN, 1-110), the helical (CHRH, 111-196), and

238

the C-terminus domains (CHRC, 197-385).

239

CHR was identified as a circadian clock component that functions as a transcriptional repressor of

240

B/C complexes (13,14). However, details of the binding regions of CHR to B/C complexes, in

241

other words the functional domains of CHR, are unknown. Then, we searched the area of CHR

242

that functions as an inhibitor to the transcription activator B/C complexes using the luciferase

243

reporter assay. Based on the prediction, luciferase reporter assays were used to test domain effects

244

including CHRN, CHRH and CHRC with respect to transcription activation by the B/C complexes.

245

In this mammalian reporter system, both mPeriod-2 (mPer2) and full-length CHR as positive

246

controls repressed the B/C complexes using a reporter pPPK2::Fluc (pR2.8) that contains E-box

247

(CACGTG) elements in the promoter region and a reporter pPCMV::Rluc(R-luc) as the internal

248

reference (29). However, these separate domains were unable to repress transcription activation by

249

the B/C complexes individually (Fig. 1B), which indicates the repressive domain is larger than any

250

individual part. Therefore, we performed the assays using the combinations of individual parts

251

(CHRNH and CHRHC represent the combinations of CHRN, CHRH and CHRC) to find the

252

inhibition part of CHR. CHRHC has been regarded as the functional area via showing

253

repression as strong as the PER2 protein on the B/C complexes (Fig. 1C).Furthermore, a

254

series of the extended constructs, CHRH2 (111~262), CHRH3 (111~264) and CHRH4

255

(111~298), were made on the basis of the CHRH and CHRHC. Then, CHRH2, CHRH3 and

256

CHRH4 were applied in the luciferase reporter assay. As the data indicate, CHRH3 and

257

CHRH4 prevented the activation by the B/C complexes, while CHRH2 was not able to

258

repress the activation (Fig. 1D).According to these results, the functional domain of CHR

259

protein is in the middle of CHR whose significant part is predicted to be an α-helix rich region.

Secondary structure of MBP-CHRH/CHRH3 measured by CD spectroscopy.

262

Since we constructed those truncations on the basis of the secondary structure prediction, we

263

further carried out experiments to confirm our prediction. Thus, we first attempted to acquire its

264

tertiary structures through protein crystallization. We tried different tags (GST, 6XHis or MBP)

265

and series of truncations to purify CHR proteins. Eventually, we chose MBP as a tag to purify

266

truncated CHR proteins. However, we were not successful to get information of CHR’s tertiary

267

structure through crystallization by now. Based on our luciferase reporter assays, we decided to

validate the predicted secondary structure by means of CD spectroscopy. In view of yield and

269

purity, MBP tagged CHRH and CHRH3 were chosen to carry out the CD experiments,

270

MBP-CHRH yielded ~ 40 mg per liter culture, while MBP-CHRH3 merely had 2 mg per liter

271

which may be due to the increase of flexible region (Figs. 2A& 2B). According to the prediction,

272

CHRH is α-helix rich, while the component of CHRH3’s elongated part is mainly flexible (Fig.

273

2C).We supposed MBP-CHRH’s ratio of absorption peak at 222nm and 208nm, which

274

characterizes the percentage of helicity (30), should be larger than that of MBP-CHRH3. Based on

275

the result of measurement, MBP-CHRH (ratio: 1.2506) exhibited higher percentage of helicity

276

than MBP-CHRH3 (ratio: 1.0862) (Fig.2D), and MBP-CHRH fusion did not change the helicity

277

percentage of MBP (ratio: 1.2849) as MBP-CHRH3 did. Consistent with secondary structure

278

prediction, CHRH is an α-helix rich region.

279
280

The helix-rich domain is necessary for CHR/BMAL1 combining.

281

In light of above luciferase reporter assays, we sought to confirm the interaction between CHR

282

and BMAL1 using co-immunoprecipitation(co-IP). HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with

283

BMAL1 which is fused to a 5Myc-6His tag (5M6HA1, for short of 5Myc-6His-BMAL1) on the

284

N-terminus and CHR which is fused to cpVenus on the C-terminus (CHRV, for short of

285

CHR-cpVenus). The C-terminus fusion with a cpVenus tag did interfere with its cellular

286

localization (Fig. 6A). In consistent with previous reports that CHR interacts with BMAL1

287

(13-15), CHRV could be co-immunoprecipitated from extracts of HEK-293T cells together with

288

BMAL1 proteins using an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3A). Subsequently, we tested the possible

289

direct interactions between BMAL1 and series of CHR constructs as shown in Figure 1. In line

290

with previous luciferase reporter assays, the co-IP results indicated that CHRN, CHRH or CHRC

291

alone fused to cpVenus (CHRNV, CHRHV or CHRCV) was not able to interact with 5M6HA1

292

(Fig. 3B). Again, in agreement with the reporter assays, the detection of CHRHC-cpVenus

293

(CHRHCV) in the co-IP products using anti-Myc antibodies indicated that CHRHC carries the

294

repressive function and the helical domain of CHR is necessary for BMAL1/CHR combining (Fig.

295

3C). Moreover, in the same system, shorter CHRHC truncated variants (CHRH3 and CHRH4)

296

could be immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc antibodies from extracts of HEK-293T cells

297

co-transfected with 5M6HA1 (Fig. 3D&3E), while CHRH2, merely two amino acids shorter than

298

CHRH3, could not be detected (Fig. 3F). These results signify that the middle region of CHR

299

(111~264) is the minimum area for BMAL1/CHR binding. In summary, it is vital for CHR to

300

perform as a transcriptional repressor that its middle area containing a highly helical domain

301

combining to BMAL1 directly.

302
303

The C-terminus of BMAL1 that is responsible for binding with CHR.

304

A previous study had found a region (514~594) of BMAL1 adjacent to the CRY1 interacting

305

terminus using sequence alignment between C-terminal domains of BMAL1 and BMAL2

306

(14).The full-length CHR was reported to interact with this region, causing interference with

307

binding between B/C complexes and CRE binding protein (CBP) or p300, the transcriptional

308

co-activator of circadian clock pathways (14). However, they did not furnish evidence that the

309

unique region alone has an interaction with CHR by means of immunoprecipitation or other

310

reliable interaction assays. To better understand how CHR interacts with BMAL1 to repress the

311

activity of B/C complexes, we decided to confirm the interaction between CHR and BMAL1C.

312

However,

313

co-immunoprecipitate with the full-length CHR protein (Fig. 4A).In addition, to solidify our

314

evidences, we also carried out immunofluorescence (IF) assays to test the interactions (Fig. 4H).

315

As a transcriptional repressor, exotic expressed CHRV located to the nuclei, as detected by the

316

fused fluorescent protein. Our IF assay using anti-Myc antibodies indicated that BMAL1-C

317

located to the cytoplasm. The merged image implied that CHRV and 5M6HA1-Cwere not able to

318

interact with each other (Fig. 4H), consistent with our co-IP results (Fig. 4A).Under such

319

circumstance, we believed that there is no sufficient evidence that the right domain of BMAL1

320

C-terminus has been identified for BMAL1/CHR combination. Since we knew that the last 43

in

our

data,

5Myc-6His-hBMAL1-C

(5M6HA1-C,

514~594)

failed

to

321

amino acids of BMAL1 are required for transcriptional activation (23)and CBP also combines to it

322

(25), we hypothesized that CHR disturbed CBP’s co-activation by combining to the last 43 aa of

323

BMAL1(583~626)as well. To test our hypothesis, firstly, we tested whether CHR interacted with

324

the C-terminus of BMAL1. Indeed, 5Myc-6His-hBMAL1-N (5M6HA1-N, 1~490) was not

325

capable of co-immunoprecipitating with CHRV together from extracts of HEK-293T cells (Fig.

326

4B), while 5Myc-6His-hBMAL1-C longer version (5M6HA1-Cl, 490~626) succeeded (Fig.4C).

327

Then, we used 5Myc-6His-hBMAL1-C shorter version (5M6HA1-Cs, 579~626), containing the

328

last 43 aa, to pull CHRV down, and it also succeeded in precipitating the CHRV protein (Fig. 4D).

329

What’s more, owing to the fact that CRY1 and CBP compete for BMAL1 TAD domain binding

330

(31, 32), and the fact that IxxLL motif in the TAD α-helix is the major binding site for both

331

CRY1and CBP (25), we constructed L606A and L607A double mutated 5M6HA1 (mut5M6HA1),

332

which destroyed the IxxLL motif (25), to exam whether CHR competes with CBP by combining

333

to TAD domain directly. And the data illustrates that under the ruin of the IxxLL motif in the TAD

334

domain, interaction between BAML1 and CHR disappeared (Fig. 4E).In other words, CHR, like

335

CRY1,also has a competition with CBP for BMAL1 TAD binding. Since CHRH3 retains the

336

repression function of CHR (Fig. 1D), we used 5M6HA1-Cs to pull CHRH3V down. Although

337

CHRH3V has been precipitated, compared with the combinations between CHR and BMAL1-Cs

338

and between CHRH3 and BMAL1, there is much weaker combination between CHR3 and

339

BMAL1-Cs (Fig. 4F). It is probably that the functional domain may need extra parts to stabilize

340

the combination. Therefore, we tested the combination between 5M6HA1-Cs and CHRH4V,

341

which is capable to repress the transcriptional activity evoked by B/C complexes and be

342

immunoprecipitated by BMAL1 as well (Figs. 1D & 3E). Then, a stronger binding, compared with

343

CHRH3, has been found between CHRH4 and the C-terminus of BMAL1 (Fig. 4G). In terms of

344

these data, we suggested that CHRH3 is the minimal domain to exercise as a repressor via being

345

attached to BAML1-Cs, and the coils adjacent to its C-terminus might be regarded as an additional

346

stabilizing part to maintain the binding. Similarly, we confirmed the combination between CHR

347

and the C-terminus of BMAL1 via IF (Fig. 4H).Consistently, the short construct CHRH3 showed

348

less co-localization, compared to the full-length CHR (Fig. 4H, bottom V.S. middle). Thus, the

349

repressing domain, CHRH3, is important for interactions between CHR and B/C complexes

350

through the TAD domain at BMAL1’s C-terminus..

351

CRISPR knocking-out of CHR disturbs the circadian timekeeping.

352

As one of the core components of mammalian molecular circadian clock, BMAL1’s C-terminal

353

TAD domain determines circadian period (25). Since CHR interacts with BMAL1’s TAD domain,

354

we proposed that CHR also contributes to generating the 24 hr period. Previous studies have

355

demonstrated that knocking-out chrono in animals could lengthen the circadian period (13-15),

356

which agrees with our proposal. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether KO of chrono in cultured cells

357

would interfere with the circadian period. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (33), the highest score

358

of a 20-nt guide sequence targeting exon 1 of chrono gene was selected as the sgRNA, which

359

is described in the M&M. The chrono gene was knocked out in U2-OS cells which harbor a

360

luciferase reporter under the control of bmal1 promoter, generating chrono-/-bmal1Luc U2-OS cells.

361

We PCR-amplified the target region from chrono-/-bmal1Luc genomic DNA, followed by

362

sequencing. The results showed that both chrono alleles were modified, with one allele losing 4 bp

363

and the other allele having 1 bp insertion at the Cas9 cleavage site (Fig. 5A). These frameshift

364

mutations created premature translation stop codons, which eventually knocked out chrono in

365

U2-OS cells (Fig. 5B). Comparing to the wild-type U2-OS cells (WT, 22.18  0.068 hr),

366

chrono-/-bmal1Luc cells (24.47  0.453 hr) exhibited lengthened circadian period of ~2 hours (Figs.

367

5C&5D). Our cell based results were in consistency with previous animal studies. Overall, these

368

data suggested that CHR plays a role in maintaining the 24 hr periodicity via interacting with the

369

C-terminal TAD domain of BMAL1.

370
371

cpVenus fused to the N-terminus of CHR interferes with its nuclear localization.

372

We have identified the domain of CHR that interacts with BMAL1 to repress the transcription

373

activation of B/C complexes. This domain contains the predicted helix domain and a partial

374

extended coiled region in its C-terminus. These facts make us wonder what the N-terminus of

375

CHR functions. Thus, we constructed two plasmids that cpVenus conjugated at CHR’s C-terminus

376

(CHRV) and the N-terminus (VCHR) separately to study the cellular localization of CHR. At first,

377

we checked the location of those proteins in the U2-OS cell line, because CHR is a transcriptional

378

factor located in the nuclei (13), and these two fused proteins were supposed to enter nuclei, too.

379

However, VCHR not CHRV tended to stay at cytoplasm (Fig. 6A). On account of this

380

phenomenon, we hypothesized that a nuclear localization signal (NLS) may lie in the N-terminus

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/754168; this version posted September 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

381

of CHR and cpVenus as a rather huge tag (26KD) may block the nuclear importin via covering the

382

NLS or interfering with its importing partner. However, existing NLS prediction algorithms did

383

not help us find any obvious NLS motif: although CHR is a nuclear protein, there is no specific

384

sequence being rendered as a NLS. Perhaps there is a novel NLS in the N-terminus, so we sought

385

to test whether CHRNV located in the nuclei. Later, we checked the expression of these cpVenus

386

fused truncations via immunofluorescence microscopy. In Hela cell line, we found CHRNV was

387

inclined to locate in the nuclei as much as CHRV, while CHRHV and CHRCV spread evenly in

388

whole cell (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, we used NIH 3T3 cells to check distributions of these

389

truncations. Compared with distributions of CHRHV and CHRCV, CHRNV has s strong

390

accumulation in the nuclei (Fig. 6C). Noteworthy, expression of CHRNV was obviously higher

391

than CHRHV and CHRCV’s in both cell lines, and these data are consistent with the western blot

392

results (Fig. 3B). Perhaps, the nuclear-entrance protected CHRN from being degraded. Based on

393

the statistics, we suggested that N-terminus of CHR leads itself to enter the nuclei, though we have

394

not identified the exact NLS signal yet.

Discussion
Analysis of “ciart” or “chrono” in the Uniprot website suggested that this gene appeared in

399

vertebrate during evolution. No homologous gene has been reported, and no structures are

400

described. Thus, to learn about CHR protein, we optimized codon usage to obtain high-yield

401

recombinant proteins (Figs. 2A& 2B), and then performed circular dichroism spectroscopy

402

experiments. CD spectra analysis confirmed predictions of the helical domain and we purified the

403

helical domain of CHR with high yield. We could not crystalize the region which may need more

404

length optimization. Then, we showed that the domain of CHR mainly composed of this helical

405

domain associates with the C-terminus of BMAL1 and represses transcriptional activity of B/C

406

complexes. And the N-terminus could help CHR located in the nuclei without any known NLS

407

sequence. Nonetheless, in the CHRN sequences, there are ten arginine and four lysine, which have

408

a potential to compose a novel NLS. Although CHRC had no obvious effects on B/C complex

409

activity, this flexible domain may stabilize the interaction between CHR and BMAL1 or may form

410

complexes with other proteins.

411

Recently, biochemical analysis and cell-based functional assays have helped us understand

412

how negative factors inhibit the B/C complex-dependent transcriptional activation. Duong and

413

colleagues reported that PERs form large complexes with more than ten other proteins, including

414

many known clock proteins BMAL1, CLOCK, CRY1/2,CK1δ/ε, and NONO and other proteins

415

such as PSF, SIN3, and HDAC around the E-box region on chromatin (34). The large protein

416

complex deacetylates histone 3 and 4, and then represses B/C complex transcription. In contrast,

417

the molecular PER-PSF-SIN-HDAC axis antagonizes acetyl transferase activity of CLOCK,

418

offering another way that PER2 functions as a repressor (16). Ye and colleagues found that

419

binding of PERs to the BMAL1/CLOCK/CRY complex removed BMAL1 from the E-box

420

containing promoter regions of ccgs, resulting in loss of the transcriptional activation. Thus, PER

421

proteins could act both ways to repress transcription (Fig.7). Differences in PER protein activity

422

may depend on specific proteins PERs interacting with, and more work is required to understand

423

these differences.

424

CRYs function as a repressor independently of PER proteins. CRY1 is a stronger repressor

425

than CRY2 during negative feedback (22), while CRY2 may repress transcription cooperatively

426

with PER proteins. CRY1 competes with the transcriptional activator, CBP/p300 for binding to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/754168; this version posted September 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

427

BMAL1 on chromatin (25). Early studies identified that the last 43 aa of BMAL1 (632 and 626 aa

428

for mouse and human BMAL1, respectively) are required for association with CRY1 (23), and Xu

429

and colleagues found that an L606A/L607A mutant at the BMAL1 C-terminus not only disrupted

430

the association between CRY1 and BMAL1, but also abolished circadian cycling (25). The

431

extreme end of BMAL1 is sequestered by CRY1 from transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300.

432

Therefore, CRY1 proteins repress transcription differently than PER proteins.

433

Using co-IP, we reported that the 579-626aa region of hBMAL1 associates with the helical

434

domain of CHR. Unlike previous reports that CHR binds to a different region of BMAL1 from

435

where CRY proteins bind (14), our data supported that CHR and CRY associates to the same TAD

436

domain of BMAL1 (Fig. 4).Goriki et al. reported that repression of CHR is HDAC-dependent (13).

437

Collectively, we proposed a model by which PERs, CRYs, and CHR repress B/C transcriptional

438

complexes (Fig. 7). In brief, PER can either form large complexes to recruit HDAC or displace the

439

B/C complex away from chromatin; CRY and CHR interact with the extreme C-terminal end of

440

BMAL1 to block it from transcriptional co-activators;CHR also recruits HDAC to disrupt the

441

activation. PER proteins associate with the PAS domain of BMAL1 and CLOCK proteins (23),

442

and CRY1 and CHR bind to the C-terminus of BMAL1(Fig. 7). Under such interacting modes,

443

PER, CRY, and CHR differentially act as transcriptional repressors to regulate clock functions.

444

From the model we summarized above, it remains undetermined whether CHR can replace

445

CRYs in the mammalian circadian clock. Studies from genetically modified animal models

446

indicate abolished locomotor rhythms in cry1/cry2 double knockout mice (35,36). However, SCN

447

slices from neonate cry1/cry2 mice had robust circadian luminescence rhythm (37,38). It is

448

conceivable that CHR may compensate for loss of CRY proteins during early development, but

449

later ciart expressed specific tissue. More work with CHR expression, especially the SCN in the

450

cry1/cry2 adult mice may provide important clues to solve this puzzle.

Figure 1.CHR repression domain that contains an α-helix rich region.(A) Predicted secondary

576

structures show an α-helix rich region in the middle of CHR, with flexible regions in the N- and

577

C- termini. Pie charts show that CHR containing a large proportion of flexible composition and a

578

lot of regions are exposed. (B)Based on predicted secondary structures, CHR was divided into 3

579

separate parts: CHRN, CHRH, and CHRC. In the classical luciferase reporter assay which uses

580

B/C complexes to activate an E-box containing promoter (pR2.8 in this experiment), each

581

individual part of CHR lost the repressive activity of CHR. (C)However, the combination of the

582

predicted helix region plus the C-terminus is able to function as a repressor, rather than the

583

combination of the helix region plus the N-terminus.(D) Luciferase assaysin dicate that CHRH

584

plus extended regions at its C-terminus(CHRH3 and CHRH4) could repress the transcription

585

activation by B/C complexes. Since CHRH3 is 2 amino acids longer than CHRH2 that did not

586

perform the repressive function, this indicates that the helix containing H3 is the minimal domain

587

that functions as a repressor to B/C complexes. At least three independent experimental repeats

588

were done for each luciferase reporter assay. Graphpad Prism 5 was used to generate graphs/plots

higher than MBP-CHRH3’s. We gathered proteins at the peak area for subsequent

595

from 111~196, is mainly composed of α-helix motifs; CHRH3,from 111~264,has extra coils and

609

at CHRH3’s C-terminus, failed to be immunoprecipitated by 5M6H-BMAL1.At least two

610

independent experimental repeats were done for each co-IP experimental set.

Figure 4. Co-IP and IF suggest that the C-terminus rather than other region of BMAL1

613

interacts with CHR (A) The unique region of BMAL1 reported by previous study (14), from 514

614

to 594, could not pull CHR down in HEK 293T cell extracts. (B)The N-terminus of BMAL1 is not

615

able to co-immunoprecipitated with full-length CHR either when both were co-transfected in HEK

616

293T cells. (C)However, a construct of the intact C-terminus of BMAL (from 490 to 626) named

617

as BMAL1Clong (BMAL1Cl) is able to precipitate full-length CHR in HEK 293T cells.

618

(D)BMAL1-C short (BAML1Cs, from 579 to 626),the distal C-terminal domain of BMAL1, is

619

sufficient to immunoprecipitate CHR from HEK 293T cell extracts when both BMAL1Cs and

620

CHR were co-transfected. (E)Via disruption of the IxxLL motif in the TAD domain at BMAL1’s

621

distal C-terminus via Leucine-to-Alanine mutations at 606 and 607 sites, full-length CHR was not

622

able to be precipitated using anti-Myc antibodies that successfully pulled down 5M6H tagged

623

BMAL1 proteins. (F)BMAL1s could weakly precipitate with the minimum repressing domain of

624

CHR (CHRH3) using anti-My cantibodies, which agrees to the luciferase reporter assays. (G)In

625

comparison to CHRH3, more CHRH4 was precipitated by BMAL1Cs.(H)In line with these IP

626

results, immunofluorescence (IF) confirmed the interactions between BMAL1-Cs and full-length

627

CHR and the minimum repressor CHRH3, while CHR failed to co-localize with BMAL1-C

(514~594).Note that an unspecific band appeared when the short forms of BMAL1 C-terminus

was used in the IP assays. Asterisk marks in panels A, D and F designate unspecific precipitated

it from transcriptional co-activators; CHR binds to BMAL1 to either recruit HDAC or disrupt the

CHR bind to the TAD domain in the distal C-terminus of BMAL1. Under these different

CHRV (cpVenus on the C-terminus of CHR) and VCHR (cpVenus on the N-terminus of CHR) in
U2-OS cell line. CHRV mainly localized in the nuclei, while VCHR mainly stayed in the
cytoplasm. (B) Different CHR constructs were expressed to study their cellular distributions in
Hela cells. (C) Different CHR constructs were expressed to study their cellular distributions in
NIH 3T3 cells. CHRV was used as a control to show the nuclear localization of CHR, while EGFP
was used as a control to show universal localization of GFP. According to the data presented in
panels B and C, the N-terminus of CHR determines the nuclear localization. Representative
images are presented.

Figure 7.A molecular repression model of how CHR functions as a repressor in the
mammalian circadian clock. During repression, PER2 can form large complexes to recruit
HDAC or displace the B/C complex away from chromatin; CRY interacts with BMAL1 to restrict
it from transcriptional co-activators; CHR binds to BMAL1 to either recruit HDAC or disrupt the
recruitment of co-activators. PER proteins associate with the PAS domain of BMAL1; CRY1 and
CHR bind to the TAD domain in the distal C-terminus of BMAL1. Under these different
interacting modes, PER, CRY and CHR function differentially to repress the circadian clock.
