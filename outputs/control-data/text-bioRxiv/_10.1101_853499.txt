Amyloid-β aggregation at the cell-membrane of neruonal cells is
implicated as a source of toxicity for Alzheimer’s disease. Small
molecules have been studied for their ability to supress amyloid
aggregation and toxicity, but the presence of membranes negate
their activity. Here, we have identified 5 small molecules that are
active at the membrane interface.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a deadly and debilitating ailment
that currently affects 50 million people worldwide.1 Early
research into AD focused on the presence of indicative protein
amyloid-beta (Aβ) fibrils due to their prominence in
postmortem examination of patients’ brains. However, it is now
hypothesized that small, toxic, intermediate species, known as
oligomers, are the predominant toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ40)
species in AD.2 Aβ peptides are produced from the cleavage of
amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the extracellular membrane
by β and γ-secretases. Cellular membranes have been
implicated to be a site of potential toxicity and can act as a
catalyst for amyloid aggregation.3 Some oligomers are
proposed to impart their toxic function by interacting directly
with the cell membrane of neurons then disrupting and
permeabilizing the membrane. As a result, non-selective ion
channels and large pores are created which, in turn, ablate the
charge gradient necessary for neuronal function.4 Many studies
suggest that lipid membranes are able to accelerate the
aggregation of Aβ as well as facilitate the formation of unique
structures of Aβ species that are specific to lipid bilayer
disruption.5
There has been extensive investigation into small molecules
with the ability to modulate the aggregation of Aβ in solution.6
However, the search for modulators of Aβ aggregation has
relied heavily on serendipity; often times, a novel class of

inhibitors is accidentally discovered, and improved analogues
are subsequently synthesized.7 Relying on accidental
discoveries is unlikely to generate a diverse enough chemical
portfolio to successfully generate a drug candidate that can
demonstrate clinical efficacy. Thus, it is essential to identify new
and novel chemical species which may be specifically capable of
modulating membrane-assisted Aβ40 aggregation for use as
toxic Aβ oligomer probes.2 Here, through the usage of a small
molecule library, 5 compounds have been identified that
modulate the formation of Aβ40 aggregates in the presence of
lipid membrane. These small molecules represent an avenue for
the development and further investigation of Aβ40 and
membrane interactions.
Using a library of over 1,800 compounds, selected for their
chemical diversity and biological activity, the screening was
performed by the addition of biologically obtained Aβ40 in the
presence of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of a
mixture of 7:3 molar ratio of DOPC:DOPG, which represents the
charge distribution of eukaryotic membranes (Figure 1A). To
probe the interactions between the lipid bilayer, small
molecules, and Aβ40, we used a fluorescence readout assay
regularly employed in amyloid studies using Thioflavin-T (ThT)
dye. ThT assays provide insights into the kinetics of amyloid
formation, which facilitates the identification of compounds
that are able to inhibit the formation of β-sheet rich amyloid
aggregates. Signal intensity can be proportional to the fibers
present and decreases in intensity can be indicative of a
decrease in overall fiber content (Figure S1). We optimized
screening conditions, achieving a Z-score of 0.46 (Figure 1C). 40
reproducible hits were selected after ruling out initially
fluorescent compounds and compounds which did not give a
matching read-out in twin sets of plates. These 40 compounds
were then used for a concentration response curve (CRC)
titration screen to determine the activity of the compounds in a
range of concentrations (Figures S2 and S3). Results from the
CRC screen helped us to narrow down the 40 initial hits to 21
primary hits based on the calculated IC50 values and the

exclusion of known compounds with PAINS properties (Figure
1D, Tables S1 and S2).7
The selected 21 compounds were initially subjected to full
ThT kinetic profiles with measurements taken every 5 minutes
(Figure S4). Each compound was tested at 10, 5 and 2 molar
equivalencies in respect to the concentration of Aβ40 while in
the presence of 500 μM LUVs. Initially by the ThT assay, many
appear to be promising and robust inhibitors, with many
compounds negating the aggregation fully at all the
concentrations tested. However, while as critical as the ThT
assay is to studying amyloid aggregation, it is also subject to
fluorescent quenching, overlap, or displacement by other
compounds. Because of this, secondary confirmation not
relying on fluorescence was performed to further narrow down
the hit compounds. To do this we used the dot blot assay
utilizing the OC anti-amyloid fiber antibody, which is known to
bind to the general amyloid fiber β-sheet epitope (Figures 2A
and S5).9 While many of the compounds looked to be complete
inhibitors by the ThT assay, the strong antibody reactivity
observed for Ab in presence of these compounds indicated that
they do not inhibit fiber formation. After identifying compounds
that interfere with ThT, we then examined the compounds that
gave 50% or less reactivity by the dot blot assay by examining
them via Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (Figure 2B).
Out of the 15 compounds investigated, 5 of them inhibited Aβ40
fibers, thus AQ-4, THQ-1, BF-3, DHQ-1 and DHQ-2, which were
selected for a deeper investigation. Of the other 10 compounds
that had fiber formation identified at this stage, many of them

exhibited very interesting and distinct fiber morphologies,
which could be of interest for further investigation, as some of
them have been reported to be amyloid inhibitors in the
absence of membrane.
Understanding the secondary structure transitions is
important for amyloid investigation, as there is a known shift
from a random-coil monomer to β-sheet fiber. To study the
compounds’ effects on Aβ secondary structure, the 5 nonwater-soluble compounds were incorporated in the lipid
bilayer, which was confirmed by UV-Vis (Figure S6). Upon
incorporation of the compounds in the lipid bilayer at a 10:1
lipid to compound molar ratio, we monitored the Aβ structural
transitions by circular dichroism (CD) experiments as well as by
ThT kinetics (Figures 2C, S7, S8). After 24 hours, AQ-4 and BF-3
still exhibited a random-coil structure. DHQ-2 and THQ-1
showed a minor helical conformation, while DHQ-1 showed a
strong β-sheet conformation for Ab. Up to 7 days, AQ-4
maintained random-coil conformation, whereas BF-3, DHQ-1,
and DHQ-2 showed β-sheet conformation. THQ-1, however,
showed poor signal and showed some slight β-sheet
characteristics for Ab but was not fully interpretable at 48
hours, but appeared more clearly β-sheet after 7 days.
Using NMR, we investigated the interaction of 15N-labeledAβ40 with the reported compounds both with and without the
presence of loaded LUVs using 2D 1H/15N SOFAST-HMQC
experiments (Figures 3, S9, and S10). This experiment is useful
in determining the level of peptide aggregation (or monomer
depletion) in solution. Because large aggregates such as amyloid
fibers tumble slowly on the NMR timescale they do not
contribute to the observed signal and any signal is conferred to
be fast tumbling oligomers or monomers. The volume of each
peak as well as the signal-to-noise ratio were analyzed (Figures
3 and S11-S13). In the presence of loaded vesicles, Aβ40 showed
15 well resolved peaks at time zero, with only 4 peaks with poor
S/N were observable after 96 hours. For three of the
compounds (DHQ-1, DHQ-2 and BF-3), the observed NMR
resonances was found to be distributed throughout the amino
acid sequence of Aβ40 at time zero and after 24 hours, which

was also the case in the samples without lipids. For AQ-4, 5
peaks from the C terminus of Aβ40 were seen even after 96
hours of incubation, which was also seen in the sample without
lipids, indicating some sort of conserved similarities which could
signify that the compound is both interacting with the lipid
bilayer as well as Aβ40 itself. A possible explanation to this is that
the N terminus is bound inside an oligomer or to the membrane
with a solvent exposed C terminus tail. Spectra of Ab with THQ1 and lipids showed very little signal intensity at time zero, with
no visible peaks after 96 hours. The opposite was seen in the
THQ-1 sample without lipids, in which well resolved peaks of
Aβ40 were seen at both time zero and at 96 hours. This indicates
that ThQ1 interacts and inhibits Aβ40 aggregation but does not
interact well in presence of lipids, at least when loaded with
lipids, since it appeared to be a strong inhibitor in the assays
prior to loading the compounds in LUVs. It is also probable that
some of the signal loss and poor S/N could be due to Aβ40
binding to 100 nm LUVs that decreases the tumbling rate of
LUVs. Experiments utilizing smaller membrane mimetic such as
nanodiscs and implementing paramagnetic quenching NMR
experiments could be an enlightening next step to understand
these systems.
After the NMR measurements, the samples in presence of
lipids were analyzed using Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)
(Figures 4 and S14). Three distinct peak areas were seen and the
area under each curve was quantified to determine the
distribution of aggregates within the sample. Peak area 1

(between 5 and 8 mL) consisted of multiple peaks most likely
made up of LUVs and Aβ40 amyloid fibers. Peak area 2 (15 mL)
most possibly corresponds to an oligomer of 4 monomers (~17
kDa) or an oligomer of 3 monomers with each bound to 2
compounds (~16 kDa). Lastly, Peak area 3 could correspond to
monomer and dimer of Aβ40, eluting at 21.5 and 20 mL
respectively. Since, these samples contain lipids, it is possible
that a portion of the intensity of the peaks is also lipids that have
been fragmented from the LUVs. For AQ-4, DHQ-1 and BF-3,
over 50% of the eluted sample was either in peak area 2 or 3,
indicating the presence of a small amount of fibers. While the
control, THQ-1, and DHQ-2 samples had 60% or more of the
total signal in peak area 1. The control samples showed no signal
inside of peak area 2. Additionally, there was a very small peak
seen at 11 mL which could indicate a very large oligomer or
protofibers. Inside peak area 1, three distinct peaks were
observed: one for LUVs at 7.5 mL, one for fibers at 6.5 mL, and
in between them; there is also a less resolved peak that may be
Aβ40 bound to LUVs, which is also not well resolved with the
control sample of Aβ40 in LUVs. For the control LUVs sample, a
small percentage of the total sample eluted in peak area 3,
which could correspond to small lipid micelles. This could
indicate that some of the signal in the other samples may also
contain micelles or lipids that have been fragmented from the
bilayer as the result of the peptide aggregation on the
membrane.

A high-throughput screen has led to the identification of 5
membrane active Aβ40 amyloid inhibitors, with a brief summary in
Table 1. Among them, DHQ-1, DHQ-2 and THQ-1 were found to be
the least robust as shown by NMR, SEC and CD results, whereas BF-3
and AQ-4 exhibited the most evidence that they are able to stop the
aggregation (or trap the aggregates) at the membrane interface. AQ4 showed the highest ratio of oligomers by SEC, a constant randomcoil signal from CD as well as the same 5 residues maintaining signal
intensity in samples with and without membrane. This could indicate
that even though AQ-4 interacts with the membrane, it is also able
to directly interact with Aβ40. BF3 showed similar results as that
observed for AQ-4. It showed no aggregation by ThT, maintained
observable NMR signal intensity but induced an overall loss in
intensity for every residue and also showed smaller species by SEC;

this observation could indicate that while BF3 does not allow Aβ40 to
aggregate, some Aβ40 population is still binding to the membrane
surface. While DHQ-1 DHQ-2 and THQ-1 are less membrane active,
they are still novel scaffolds for the inhibition of Aβ40. Although DHQ1 and DHQ-2 showed some differences in activity, they may be a
good starting point for developing derivatives. Given their similar
architecture and sites for potential for synthesis, they could be used
in an interesting study for structure activity relationship (SAR)
analysis. The initial investigation and subsequent rule out of THQ-1
demonstrates the need for deep characterization for amyloid and
small molecule interactions.
Given the similarity of membrane activities of AQ-4 and BF-3, it
is possible that this may be due to their planar structure and lack of
free rotation among the aromatic groups. However, many
compounds initially investigated as part of the 21 primary hits
produced prominent fibers; so clearly there must be unique
properties possessed by these two compounds and their interplay
between Aβ40 and the membrane which render their inhibitory
activities. With the presented results as a starting point, NMR would
be a robust tool to further investigate the structure of the Aβ40
compound structure as well as in conjunction with the membrane.
