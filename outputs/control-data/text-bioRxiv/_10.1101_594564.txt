Abstract

29

Bacterial colonization of the urogenital tract is limited by innate defenses, including the

30

production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) resist

31

AMP-killing to cause a range of urinary tract infections (UTIs) including asymptomatic

32

bacteriuria, cystitis, pyelonephritis, and sepsis. UPEC strains have high genomic diversity and

33

encode numerous virulence factors that differentiate them from non-UTI causing strains,

34

including ompT. As OmpT homologues cleave and inactivate AMPs, we hypothesized that

35

high OmpT protease activity-levels contribute to UPEC colonization during symptomatic

36

UTIs. Therefore, we measured OmpT activity in 58 UPEC clinical isolates. While

37

heterogeneous OmpT activities were observed, OmpT activity was significantly greater in

38

UPEC strains isolated from patients with symptomatic infections. Unexpectedly, UPEC

39

strains exhibiting the greatest protease activities harboured an additional ompT-like gene

40

called arlC (ompTp). The presence of two OmpT-like proteases in some UPEC isolates led us

41

to compare the substrate specificities of OmpT-like proteases found in E. coli. While all three

42

cleaved AMPs, cleavage efficiency varied on the basis of AMP size and secondary structure.

43

Our findings suggest the presence ArlC and OmpT in the same UPEC isolate may confer a

44

fitness advantage by expanding the range of target substrates.

1 Introduction

46

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common cause of bacterial infections

47

requiring antibiotic treatment (Flores-Mireles, Walker, Caparon, & Hultgren, 2015; Foxman,

48

2014; Hooton & Stamm, 1997). The majority of community acquired UTIs (70-95%) and

49

recurrent UTIs are caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) (Flores-Mireles et al.,

50

2015; Nielubowicz & Mobley, 2010). The human gut acts as a reservoir for UPEC strains

51

where they form part of the fecal flora (Kaper, Nataro, & Mobley, 2004; Moreno et al., 2006).

52

Following colonization of the periurethral area, UPEC infect the urinary tract in an ascending

53

manner, resulting in diseases ranging from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU), cystitis,

54

pyelonephritis and sepsis (Hooton, 2012). UPEC strains have high genomic diversity and

55

encode numerous virulence factors that differentiate them from non-UTI causing strains

56

(Johnson, 1991; Lloyd, Rasko, & Mobley, 2007; Najafi, Hasanpour, Askary, Aziemzadeh, &

57

Hashemi, 2018; Norinder, Koves, Yadav, Brauner, & Svanborg, 2012). These virulence

58

factors contribute to disease progression allowing UPEC to colonize the uroepithelium,

59

produce toxins, scavenge metabolites, and evade the host immune system (Schwab, Jobin, &

60

Kurts, 2017; Terlizzi, Gribaudo, & Maffei, 2017).

61
62

Bacterial colonization is limited in the upper urogenital tract by several mechanisms including

63

urine flow, chemical properties of urine, epithelial cell shedding, influx of immune cells

64

including neutrophils upon bacterial stimulation, and secretion of soluble proteins and

65

peptides by epithelial cells (Spencer, Schwaderer, Becknell, Watson, & Hains, 2014;

66

Weichhart, Haidinger, Horl, & Saemann, 2008). Secreted proteins and antimicrobial peptides

67

(AMPs) form part of the innate immune defenses of the urogenital tract and act through

68

immunomodulation, indirect anti-colonization activity or direct bacterial killing (Kai-Larsen

69

et al., 2010; Zasloff, 2007). AMPs are small (12-50 amino acids), cationic, amphipathic

70

peptides that exert bactericidal action by interacting with anionic bacterial membranes to form

71

pores resulting in bacterial lysis (Jenssen, Hamill, & Hancock, 2006). Two types of AMPs are

72

detected in the urogenital tract: defensins that form small disulfide bond stabilized ß-sheets

73

and the α-helical cathelicidin LL-37 (Chromek et al., 2006; Lehmann et al., 2002; Valore et

74

al., 1998). In addition, the urogenital tract produces large structured antimicrobial proteins

75

called ribonucleases (RNase) (Spencer et al., 2011; Spencer et al., 2013). Human α-defensin 5

76

(HD5), human ß-defensins (hBD) 1 and 2, LL-37 and RNase 7 are thought to prevent

77

bacterial colonization as they are constitutively expressed in the urinary tract (Kjolvmark,

78

Akesson, & Pahlman, 2017; Spencer et al., 2012). During UTIs HD5, hBD2, LL-37 and

79

RNase 7 production increases, suggesting an active role in bacterial clearance (Chromek &

80

Brauner, 2008; Chromek et al., 2006; Nielsen et al., 2014; Spencer et al., 2012; Spencer et al.,

81

2013). Remarkably, increased cathelicidin expression and LL-37 secretion is triggered a few

82

minutes after bacteria encounter uroepithelial cells. This suggested role for AMPs in UTI

83

immune defense is consistent with reports that UPEC strains are generally more resistant to

84

AMPs than commensal E. coli strains that do not colonize the urogenital tract (Chromek et al.,

85

2006).

86
87

Gram-negative bacteria use several mechanisms to resist killing by AMPs, including capsules,

88

efflux pumps, LPS modifications, and proteases (Gruenheid & Le Moual, 2012). Omptin

89

proteases are found in the Gram-negative outer bacterial membrane and have a conserved

90

active site with features of both aspartate and serine proteases (Kramer et al., 2001;

91

Vandeputte-Rutten et al., 2001). With their active sites facing the extracellular environment,

92

omptins contribute to virulence by cleaving a variety of proteins and peptides (Haiko,

93

Suomalainen, Ojala, Lahteenmaki, & Korhonen, 2009). Both substrate specificity and amino

94

acid identity are used to classify omptins into Pla-like and OmpT-like subfamilies. Pla readily

95

cleaves the proenzyme plasminogen into active plasmin to promote bacterial dissemination

96

during both bubonic and pneumonic plague (Lathem, Price, Miller, & Goldman, 2007;

97

Sodeinde et al., 1992; Zimbler, Schroeder, Eddy, & Lathem, 2015). OmpT rapidly cleaves

98

and inactivates AMPs, including LL-37, protamine, and a synthetic peptide optimized to have

99

maximum antibacterial activity called C18G (Brannon, Thomassin, Desloges, Gruenheid, &

100

Le Moual, 2013; Stumpe, Schmid, Stephens, Georgiou, & Bakker, 1998; Thomassin,

101

Brannon, Gibbs, Gruenheid, & Le Moual, 2012). OmpT-mediated AMP inactivation is

102

thought to support host colonization by some pathogenic E. coli strains (Thomassin, Brannon,

103

Gibbs, Gruenheid, & Le Moual, 2012). In addition to OmpT, two OmpT-like proteases have

104

been described in E. coli strains (Kaufmann, Stierhof, & Henning, 1994; McPhee et al., 2014;

105

Zhuge et al., 2018), these genes, called ompP and arlC (ompTp) encode proteins that have

106

approximately 74% amino acid identity to OmpT. While the physiological substrates of

107

OmpP and ArlC are unknown, OmpP has been shown to cleave the AMP protamine and ArlC

108

is associated with AMP resistance (Hwang et al., 2007; McPhee et al., 2014).

109
110

The ompT gene is present in the genome of 85-97% of UPEC clinical isolates and is used in

111

epidemiological studies to identify virulent UPEC strains, yet its function across clinical

112

isolates remains unclear (Foxman, Zhang, Palin, Tallman, & Marrs, 1995). As OmpT and

113

OmpT-like omptins play roles in resistance to host-produced AMPs, we hypothesized that

114

high OmpT protease activity-levels contribute to UPEC colonization during symptomatic

115

UTIs. To test this hypothesis, we detected ompT and measured OmpT activity in a collection

116

of 58 UPEC clinical isolates from groups of patients with infections of differing clinical

117

severity (fecal, ABU, UTI [cystitis and pyelonephritis] and sepsis). Heterogeneous OmpT

118

activity was observed and in some isolates high protease activity was correlated with the

119

presence of an additional ompT-like gene called arlC (ompTp). The presence of two OmpT-

120

like proteases in some UPEC isolates led us to compare the substrate specificity of the three

121

E. coli omptins (OmpT, OmpP and ArlC). We found that OmpT, OmpP and ArlC all cleave

122

AMPs, although cleavage efficiency of different AMP-types varied. Our results suggest that

123

the presence of multiple omptins allows UPEC to cleave at least two major subsets of AMPs

124

encountered during infection.

2 Material and Methods

126

2.1 Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions

127

58 ExPEC isolates originating from patients diagnosed with extraintestinal infections or from

128

the urine or stool of healthy individuals were obtained from the Manges collection. Included

129

isolates were randomly selected from the E. coli category to ensure they were representative.

130

Isolates were divided into 4 groups based on disease type. Fecal isolates (n = 12) were

131

recovered from the feces of healthy subjects in Québec Canada (2009-2010), ABU isolates (n

132

= 10) were from patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria in California USA (2005-2006)

133

(Manges, Johnson, & Riley, 2004), UTI isolates (n = 24) were recovered from patients with

134

cystitis in Québec Canada (2005-2007) (Manges, Tabor, Tellis, Vincent, & Tellier, 2008) and

135

cystitis or pyelonephritis in California USA (1999-2000) (Manges, Dietrich, & Riley, 2004),

136

and sepsis isolates (n = 12) were from patients with sepsis in California USA (2001-2003)

137

(Manges, Perdreau-Remington, Solberg, & Riley, 2006). Bacterial strains used in this study

138

are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were routinely cultured in lysogeny broth (LB; 10% (w/v)

139

tryptone, 5% (w/v) yeast extract, 10% (w/v) NaCl) or in N-minimal medium (50 mM Bis-

140

Tris, 5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mM K2SO4, 0.5 mM KH2PO4, 0.1% casamino

141

acids) adjusted to pH 7.5, supplemented with 1.4% glucose and 1 mM MgCl2 (UPEC isolates)

142

or with 0.5% glucose and 1 mM MgCl2 (all other strains). Bacteria were cultured at 37°C with

143

aeration (220 rpm).

144
145

2.2 Multiplex PCR of UPEC Virulence Genes

146

Total DNA (genomic and large-plasmid DNA) was isolated using the Puregene Yeast/Bact.

147

kit (Qiagen). Phylogenetic groups were determined as described in (Clermont, Bonacorsi, &

148

Bingen, 2000), using primer pairs listed in Table 2. To detect virulence genes present in the

149

isolates, primer sequences were obtained from previous studies (Johnson & Stell, 2000) or

150

designed de novo for this study (Table 2). Three multiplex PCR experiments were performed

151

as follows: pool 1: hylA (1177 bp), papAH (720 bp), fimH (508 bp), kspMTIII (392 bp), and

152

papEF (336 bp); pool 2; papC (200 bp), sfaS (240 bp), cnf1 (498 bp), fyuA (880 bp), iutA (300

153

bp), kpsMTII (272 bp); pool 3: arlC (852 bp), ompT (670 bp) and fimH (508 bp); ompP (648

154

bp).

155
156

2.3 Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Activity Assay

157

The FRET substrate containing a dibasic motif (RK) in its center (2Abz-SLGRKIQI-K(Dnp)-

158

NH2) was purchased from Anachem. Bacteria were grown in N-minimal medium to mid-

159

exponential phase and normalized to an OD595nm of 0.5. Bacterial cells were pelleted and

160

resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Bacteria (~ 2.25 x 107 CFU in 75 µL) were

161

mixed in a 96-well plate with 75 µL of the FRET substrate (final concentration 3 µM).

162

Fluorescence (λ Ex 325 nm, λ Em 430 nm) was monitored for 1 h at 25°C using a Biotek FLx

163

800 plate reader. Data were normalized by subtracting the background fluorescence of the

164

FRET substrate in PBS.

165
166

2.4 Plasmid construction

167

The ompT and arlC genes were PCR-amplified from DNA isolated from the UPEC UTI

168

clinical isolate 6, also called cystitis 6, using their respective primer pairs ompT_cf/ompT_cr

169

and arlC_cf/arlC_cr (Table 2). PCR fragments were treated with XbaI and SacI and ligated

170

into plasmid pWSK129 treated with the same enzymes, generating plasmids pWSKompT and

171

pWSKarlC (Table 1). The ompP gene was PCR-amplified from XL1-Blue DNA using primer

172

pair ompP_cf/ompP_cr. PCR-products were treated with XbaI and PstI and ligated into

173

pWSK129 treated with the same enzymes to generate plasmid pWSKompP. The pla gene

174

under control of the croP promoter was subcloned from pYCpla (Brannon, Burk, et al., 2015)

175

using XbaI and SacI and ligated into pWSK129 previously treated with the same enzymes,

176

generating pWSKpla.

177
178

2.5 Southern Blotting

179

Total DNA was isolated and treated with EcoRV. Southern blotting and hybridization were

180

performed as previously described (Taylor, Ouimet, Wargachuk, & Marczynski, 2011) using

181

Hybond-XL membranes. Probes for ompT and arlC were PCR-generated using primer pairs

182

ompT_sf/ompT_sr and arlC_sf/arlC_sr, respectively (Table 2). Probes were radiolabelled with

183

dATP [α-32P] using the RadPrime kit (Invitrogen). The pWSKarlC plasmid was used as the

184

positive control for the arlC probe.

185
186

2.6 Quantitative RT-PCR

187

Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) was performed as previously described (Thomassin, Brannon,

188

Gibbs, et al., 2012). Briefly, bacterial strains were grown to an OD595nm of 0.5 in N-minimal

189

medium. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen) and treated with

190

TURBO DNase I (Ambion) to remove residual DNA. The absence of DNA was confirmed by

191

qPCR using the primer pair rpoD_qf/rpoD_qr. RNA (100 ng) was reverse transcribed using

192

Superscript II (Invitrogen) with 0.5 µg of random hexamer primers. A reaction mixture

193

without Superscript II was also included and was used as the negative control. qPCR reactions

194

were performed in a Rotor-Gene 3000 thermal cycler (Corbett Research) using the Maxima

195

SYBR Green qPCR kit (Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

196

Primers used are listed in Table 2. The relative expression levels were calculated by

197

normalizing the threshold cycle (CT) of ompT and arlC transcripts to the CT of rpoD using the

198

2-ΔCT method (Livak & Schmittgen, 2001).

2.7 Whole genome sequencing

201

Sequencing was performed on a PacBio platform (Pacific Biosciences). Genomic DNA

202

samples were purified using the Gentra® Puregene® kit (Qiagen) and sheared to 20 kb using

203

g-tubes (Covaris). Libraries were prepared using the template preparation kit from Pacific

204

Biosciences. A single SMRT cell was sequenced to generate data sets including unique sub-

205

reads with a minimum length of 3 kb. Genome assemblies of sequence reads were generated

206

using

207

recommendations. The complete chromosome and plasmid sequences were submitted to

2.8 Preparation of whole-cell lysates and outer-membrane fractions

211

Bacteria were grown in N-minimal medium until mid-exponential phase and normalized to an

212

OD595nm of 0.5. For whole-cell lysate samples, bacterial cells were pelleted and resuspended

213

in 1/10 volume of 2X ESB (Thomas et al., 2005). Outer-membrane fractions were isolated as

214

follows: bacterial cultures were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min and pellets were

215

resuspended in 1.5 mL low-salt buffer (100 mM NaPi buffer [pH 7], 5 mM EDTA and 10%

216

glycerol). Samples were supplemented with 10 uL PMSF and sonicated. Samples were then

217

centrifuged at 5500 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 65000

218

rpm for 30 min at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in 2 mL sarcosyl buffer (10 mM Tris [pH

219

7.5], 5 mM MgCl2 and 2% sarcosyl) and incubated for 30 minutes at 10°C. Samples were

220

then centrifuged for 60 min at 45000 rpm and the pellet containing outer membranes was

221

resuspended in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 10% glycerol). Outer membrane samples

222

were combined 1:1 with 2X ESB and boiled for 10 minutes prior to loading samples on an

223

SDS-PAGE gel.

2.9 Western blotting

226

Whole-cell lysate and outer-membrane fractions were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and

227

transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris-

228

buffered saline (TBS) supplemented with 5% skim milk and incubated overnight with the

229

polyclonal anti-CroP antibody (Thomassin, Brannon, Gibbs, et al., 2012). Membranes were

230

washed extensively with TBS and incubated for 1 h with a goat anti-rabbit secondary

231

antibody conjugated with HRP. Membranes were washed and developed using

232

chemiluminescent HRP substrate.

233
234

2.10 Plasminogen activation assay

235

Bacteria were grown in N-minimal medium to mid-exponential phase and normalized to an

236

OD595nm of 0.5. Bacterial cells were pelleted and resuspended in ½ volume of phosphate-

237

buffered saline (PBS; final 6 x108 CFU/mL). In a 96 well plate, 178 µL of bacteria and 20 µL

238

of 45 mM VLKpNA (Sigma Aldrich) were combined. Baseline assays were performed at

239

OD405nm. After 5 min, 4 µg of plasminogen substrate was added and absorbance (405nm) was

240

measured every 10 min for 400 minutes at 37 °C with agitation before every reading.

241
242

2.11 Proteolytic cleavage of AMPs

243

Bacteria were grown in N-minimal medium to mid-exponential phase, washed and

244

normalized to an OD595nm of 0.5 in PBS. Aliquots of bacteria (107 CFU) were combined 1:4

245

(v/v) with 2 µg/µL LL-37, mCRAMP, C18G or Magainin II (BioChemia) or 1 µg/µL RNase

246

7 and incubated at room temperature for various time points. Bacteria were separated from

247

peptide cleavage products by centrifugation and supernatants were combined 1:1 with 2X

248

ESB then boiled and frozen at -20°C. Peptide cleavage products were resolved on 10-20%

249

Tris-Tricine gels (BioRad) and RNase 7 samples were resolved on 20% SDS-PAGE gels.

2.12 Circular dichroism spectroscopy

255

Experiments were performed on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD). AMPs (200

256

µg/ml in PBS) were placed in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm and spectra were

257

recorded from 260 to 195 nm. Samples were scanned three times at 20°C using a bandwidth

of 1 nm, a time response of 2 sec and a scan rate of 100 nm/min. Spectra were corrected by

259

subtracting the background spectrum of PBS and values were converted from ellipticity to

260

mean residue ellipticity (MRE; degree × cm2 × dmol−1).

2.13 Statistical Analyses

263

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. Normality was verified using

264

D’Agostino-Pearson normality test. Fisher’s Exact test was performed to compare incidence

265

of virulence genes within severity groups of UPEC clinical isolates. FRET activity was

266

assessed using a two way ANOVA with Tukey’s post test. P value ≤ .05 being significantly

267

different.

3 RESULTS

269

3.1 Phylogenetic and virulence profile of UPEC isolates

270

UPEC isolates from patients with different disease severities were obtained from the Manges

271

collection (Manges, Dietrich, et al., 2004; Manges et al., 2001; Manges, Johnson, et al., 2004;

272

Manges et al., 2006; Manges et al., 2008). Although UPEC strains are heterogeneous, clinical

273

isolates from UTIs predominantly belong to E. coli phylogenetic groups B2 and D (Johnson,

274

Delavari, Kuskowski, & Stell, 2001). To confirm that our isolates are generally representative

275

of UPEC clinical strains we determined the phylogenetic grouping of our 58 clinical isolates

276

categorized into the fecal (n=12), ABU (n=10), UTI (cystitis and pyelonephritis; n=24), and

277

sepsis (n=12) groups. Most isolates from the ABU and UTI groups associated with UTIs

278

belong to the phylogenetic group B2 and, to a lesser extent, D (Table 3). In contrast, isolates

279

from the sepsis group were predominantly from group D (Table 3). Finally, isolates from the

280

fecal group had the most variable phylogenetic grouping with 5/12 isolates belonging to

281

phyogenetic groups A and B1 (Table 3). Overall, this distribution is in agreement with

282

previous reports showing that UPEC strains mainly belong to E. coli phylogenetic groups B2

283

and D (Johnson et al., 2001).

284
285

The 58 isolates were further characterized using multiplex PCR to detect 12 recognized UPEC

286

virulence genes (Table. 4). Our data showed variations consistent with previous studies

287

reporting that UPEC is a heterogeneous pathotype (Marschall et al., 2012; Maynard et al.,

288

2004; Norinder et al., 2012; Poey, Albini, Saona, & Lavina, 2012). The fimH gene, involved

289

in UPEC adherence, was present in all but 2 ABU isolates (Table 4). There was a difference

290

in the distribution of virulence genes fyuA and ompT for which the incidence was significantly

291

higher in symptomatic (i.e UTI and sepsis) groups than asymptomatic (i.e. fecal and ABU)

292

groups (Table 4). No other genes showed a significant difference in incidence between

293

asymptomatic and symptomatic groups. In agreement with previous studies, we found that

294

ompT is present in 89% of the UPEC isolates associated with symptomatic infections (Table

295

4).

296
297

3.2 Variability of omptin proteolytic activities among UPEC isolates

298

OmpT preferentially cleaves substrates between two consecutive basic residues (Dekker, Cox,

299

Kramer, & Egmond, 2001; McCarter et al., 2004). Therefore, to assess OmpT proteolytic

300

activity we measured cleavage of a FRET substrate (2Abz-SLGRKIQI-K(Dnp)-NH2) that

301

contains a dibasic motif in its center (Brannon, Burk, et al., 2015; Brannon et al., 2013;

302

McPhee et al., 2014; Thomassin, Brannon, Gibbs, et al., 2012). Cleavage of the substrate by

303

the 58 UPEC isolates was monitored by measuring fluorescence emission over time and

304

compared with substrate cleavage by the previously characterized reference UPEC strain

305

CFT073 (Brannon et al., 2013). As shown in Fig. 1A, omptin activity of the isolates was

306

heterogeneous between groups. Isolates for which the ompT gene was not detected by PCR

307

showed basal activity levels (red triangles in Fig. 1A), whereas isolates harbouring the ompT

308

gene showed a wide range of omptin activity. The omptin activity of the isolates of the fecal

309

group was significantly lower than that of the 2 symptomatic groups (UTI and sepsis) (Fig.

310

1A). The mean activity of the isolates from the fecal group (0.75 ± 0.5) was lower than that of

311

strain CFT073. In contrast, the activity means of the symptomatic groups (1.54 ± 0.66 and

312

1.71 ± 0.66) were higher than that of CFT073. Extensive variability in omptin activity was

313

also observed within groups (Fig. 1A). The UTI group exibited the most heterogeneous

314

omptin activity and some isolates from the UTI group had 3-fold higher omptin activity than

315

CFT073. Together, these results indicate that omptin activity is variable among fecal and

316

UPEC clinical isolates.

3.3 OmpT-like proteases in UPEC

319

In addition to the chromosomally-encoded ompT gene, plasmid-borne ompT-like genes ompP

320

and arlC are present in several E. coli strains (Kaufmann et al., 1994; McPhee et al., 2014;

321

Zhuge et al., 2018). These OmpT-like proteins are approximately 74% identical to OmpT. To

322

determine whether the presence of ompT-like genes in some isolates may account for the

323

heterogeneity of OmpT activity observed in Fig. 1A, multiplex-PCR screens were performed

324

to detect ompT, ompP and arlC. The ompP gene was not detected in any of the isolates (data

325

not shown). In contrast, the arlC gene was present in 8 of the 58 isolates (Fig. 1B). Strikingly,

326

arlC was only present in symptomatic isolates, which was statistcially significant according to

327

a Fisher’s exact test (P = .0445). Most isolates harbouring the arlC gene also contained ompT

328

and generally had higher proteolytic activity (green circles, Fig. 1A) than CFT073. This is

329

consistent with the report that ArlC cleaves the FRET substrate (McPhee et al., 2014). Isolate

330

18 from the UTI group did not have ompT but harboured arlC (Fig. 1B); this isolate exibited

331

moderate proteolytic activity (purple triangle in Fig. 1A). Together these data show that

332

among commensal and clinical isolates, higher omptin activity is associated with symptomatic

333

disease and isolates with the greatest omptin activity harbour both the ompT and arlC genes.

334
335

3.4 Variability of ompT and arlC expression among select UPEC cystitis isolates

336

To further understand omptin activity among UPEC isolates, we selected 12 isolates from the

337

UTI group (Table 1) for further analysis because they have the most heterogeneous omptin

338

activity. The presence of ompT genes in these isolates was confirmed by Southern blot

339

analysis (Fig. 2A). This analysis also indicated that two ompT genes may be present in

340

isolates 7, 8 and 11. Consistent with the multiplex PCR results, arlC was detected in UTI

341

isolates 1, 6 and 11 (Fig. 2A). Next, qPCR was used to measure the expression levels of ompT

342

and arlC. In agreement with our activity assay, ompT-levels were heterogeneous among these

343

UTI isolates (Fig. 2B and 2C). Only three isolates (2, 10 and 11) had similar expression levels

344

as the reference strain CFT073, whereas all other isolates had higher ompT expression levels

345

than the reference strain. As expected from the multiplex-PCR screen and Southern blot, arlC

346

expression was only detected in UTI 1, 6 and 11 isolates. UTI isolates 1 and 6, which showed

347

the highest ompT and arlC expression levels also had the highest omptin activity-levels (Fig.

348

2C). Although both ompT and arlC are present in UTI isolate 11, they have low expression

349

levels, which is consistent with the low omptin activity observed (Fig. 2C). These data

350

indicate that heterogeneous omptin activity-levels are associated with both the presence and

351

the different expression levels of the ompT and arlC genes.

352
353

3.5 arlC is present on plasmids

354

To determine the genomic context of the ompT and arlC genes, isolates 1, 6 and 11 of the UTI

355

group were sequenced on a PacBio platform. These isolates were then renamed cystitis 1,

356

cystitis 6 and cystitis 11. Detailed descriptions of genomes and gene features are found in

357

Appendix (Appendix Figs. 1AB, 2AB, 3). In all three isolates, ompT was located within the

358

bacterial chromosome and arlC was part of large plasmids (79-200 kbp; Appendix Fig. 1A

359

and 2A). In addition, the ompT gene was invariably located downstream of nfrA and ybcH

360

(Fig 3A). Some differences were noted in the genomic context of ompT among the clinical

361

isolates. In cystitis 1 and 6 the envY gene, encoding a transcriptional regulator of porin

362

synthesis, is inserted between ybcH and ompT (182 bp downstream of ybcH, 512 bp upstream

363

of ompT). The appY gene, encoding a transciptional activator, is located 249 bp downstream

364

of the ompT gene in cystitis 1, whereas ymcE, encoding a putative cold shock gene, is located

365

186 bp downstream of ompT in cystitis 6. In cystitis 11 the ompT gene is located 657 bp

366

downstream of ybcH and 272 bp upstream of ybcY; this is the same genomic context as that in

367

UPEC strains CFT073, UTI89, 536, J96 ABU83972 and EPEC strain e2348/69, all of which

368

were reported to have low omptin activity (Fig. 3A, (Brannon et al., 2013; Thomassin,

369

Brannon, Gibbs, et al., 2012; Thomassin, Brannon, Kaiser, Gruenheid, & Le Moual, 2012)).

370

For all isolates, the predicted amino acid sequence of ArlC is 100% identical to ArlC

371

identified in adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) strain NRG857c (McPhee et al., 2014).

372

Although the three plasmids harbouring arlC were different (Appendix Fig. 2A and B), arlC

373

was present in all cases as part of pathogenicity island PI-6 previously reported to play a role

374

in AMP resistance (Fig. 3B, McPhee et al., 2014).

375
376

3.6 Comparative analysis of OmpT, OmpP and ArlC

377

With the unexpected detection of arlC among the UPEC clinical isolates, we hypothesized

378

that the presence of a second or even a third omptin protease within a single species may

379

provide an advantage by expanding the potential range of substrates cleaved. Therefore, we

380

sought to compare the substrate specificities of these proteases. As OmpT undergoes auto-

381

cleavage during purification (Kramer, Zandwijken, Egmond, & Dekker, 2000; Vandeputte-

382

Rutten et al., 2001) and mutagenesis of residues to stabilize the protein results in a significant

383

decrease in FRET substrate cleavage ((Kramer et al., 2000); unpublished data Thomassin JL

384

and Brannon JR) it was not possible to purify these proteases and directly compare their

385

activities. Instead, we produced OmpT, OmpP and ArlC in E. coli BL21, a laboratory strain

386

that lacks omptin proteases. To test their production and correct localization in BL21, omptin

387

proteins were detected by western blot analysis from both whole cells and outer-membrane

388

preparations (Fig. 4A). To determine if the proteases were active in BL21, FRET substrate

389

cleavage was monitored over time. As expected, BL21 with empty vector did not cleave the

390

FRET substrate, whereas the three omptins readily cleaved the FRET substrate (Fig. 4B). This

391

demonstrates that when produced in BL21, ArlC, OmpP and OmpT are found in the outer

392

membrane and are proteolytically active.

393
394

Omptin proteases are generally subdivided into OmpT-like or Pla-like subfamilies. These

395

subfamilies differ in their ability to cleave plasminogen to activate it into active plasmin, with

396

Pla-like omptins producing active plasmin more readily than OmpT-like omptins (Haiko et

397

al., 2009; Kukkonen et al., 2001). To verify that the three omptin proteases belong in the

398

OmpT-like subfamily, we tested their ability to cleave plasminogen into plasmin. Consistent

399

with their presence in the outer membrane, all three omptins cleaved plasminogen to a greater

400

extent than BL21 alone (Fig. 4C). There was no difference in their ability to activate

401

plasminogen. Compared with the positive control, Pla produced in BL21, the E. coli omptins

402

converted significantly less plasminogen into plasmin. These data are consistent with previous

403

publications (Brannon, Burk, et al., 2015; Kukkonen et al., 2001; McPhee et al., 2014) and

404

suggest that all three omptins found in E. coli belong to the OmpT-like subfamily of omptin

405

proteases.

406
407

Omptin proteases belonging to the OmpT-like subfamily have been associated with AMP

408

cleavage (Le Sage et al., 2009; Stumpe et al., 1998; Thomassin, Brannon, Gibbs, et al., 2012).

409

Previous work has shown that OmpT from EPEC, EHEC, and UPEC cleave the human

410

cathelicidin LL-37. Although ArlC was shown to play a role in AMP-resistance (McPhee et

411

al., 2014), and OmpT and OmpP are reported to exhibit similar substrate specificities (Hwang

412

et al., 2007; McCarter et al., 2004), their ability to cleave different AMPs has not been

413

directly compared. Therefore, we investigated the ability of the E. coli omptins to cleave the

414

synthetic cationic peptide C18G and various cathelicidins Magainin II (Xenopus laevis),

415

mCRAMP (Mus musculus) and LL-37 (Homo sapiens). As expected, AMPs incubated with

416

BL21 did not show any degradation or cleavage products, indicating that BL21 does not

417

contain intrinsic proteases that cleave these AMPs (Fig 5A). OmpT cleaved all peptides by the

418

first time point tested (2 min C18G; 15 min mCRAMP, Magainin II and LL-37; Fig. 5A).

419

Similarly to OmpT, OmpP readily cleaved C18G and Magainin II within 2 and 30 min,

420

respectively. In contrast, OmpP only cleaved small amounts of mCRAMP after 60 min and

421

did not appear to cleave LL-37 (Fig. 5A). ArlC cleaved mCRAMP, C18G and Magainin II by

422

the first time point tested (2 min C18G; 15 min mCRAMP and Magainin II), but only a small

423

amount of LL-37 cleavage was observed after 60 minutes. Substrate properties, such as size

424

and secondary structure are known to influence omptin activity (Brannon, Thomassin,

425

Gruenheid, & Le Moual, 2015; Hritonenko & Stathopoulos, 2007). Given that all three

426

proteases readily cleave the FRET substrate and C18G, the striking differences in ability to

427

cleave Magainin II, mCRAMP and LL-37 are likely due to intrinsic differences between

428

OmpT, OmpP and ArlC. Although all peptides tested contain sites with two consecutive basic

429

residues, they range in size from 18-37 amino acids (Fig. 5B). OmpP cleaved smaller peptides

430

such as C18G and Magainin II more readily than the larger mCRAMP and LL-37. As ArlC

431

cleaved mCRAMP more rapidly than OmpT, peptide length might not be the limiting factor

432

for this protease. Peptide secondary structure also influences omptin activity (Brannon,

433

Thomassin, et al., 2015), therefore, we used circular dichroism spectroscopy to determine the

434

secondary structure of these AMPs (Fig. 5C). Under our experimental conditions, only LL-37

435

is α-helical, while mCRAMP, C18G and Magainin II are unstructured (Fig. 5C). While

436

peptide structure did not affect OmpT activity, ArlC did not appear to cleave the only α-

437

helical AMP (Fig. 5BC). Together these findings suggest that OmpT, OmpP and ArlC have

438

differences in substrate cleavage specificities.

439
440

We previously reported that disulfide bonds present in defensins render them resistant to

441

OmpT-mediated proteolysis (Thomassin, Brannon, Kaiser, et al., 2012). Yet ArlC was shown

442

to contribute to bacterial survival in the presence of human defensins (McPhee et al., 2014),

443

suggesting that unlike OmpT, ArlC might cleave AMPs that are stabilized by disulfide

444

bridges. RNase 7 contains four disulfide bridges, three dibasic sites (Fig. 6A) and is abundant

445

in the urinary tract (Spencer et al., 2011; Spencer et al., 2013). The presence of dibasic sites

446

suggests that RNase 7 might be an omptin substrate; therefore, we sought to investigate if

447

there was a difference in omptin-mediated cleavage of this peptide. Under our experimental

448

conditions, OmpT and OmpP did not cleave RNase 7 (Fig. 6B). After 60 min incubation with

449

ArlC, an RNase 7 cleavage product appeared, with more cleavage product appearing after 90

450

min. While cleavage appears limited, ArlC was the only OmpT-like omptin able to cleave

451

RNase 7. Taken together, these data indicate that ArlC, OmpP, and OmpT have different

452

substrate specificities, suggesting that the presence of multiple omptin proteases in a single

453

bacterial strain may enhance AMP-resistance by increasing the range of substrates cleaved.

4 DISCUSSION

455

Detection of specific genes, including ompT, is often used to characterize virulent clinical

456

UPEC isolates (Johnson et al., 2001; Najafi et al., 2018). Previous studies have suggested that

457

OmpT from the UPEC strain CFT073 is involved in adhesion, invasion and/or inactivation of

458

AMPs (Brannon et al., 2013; He et al., 2015). While the presence of ompT is associated with

459

virulent strains, its precise contribution remains unclear, as UPEC clinical isolates have highly

460

variable genetic sequences (Schreiber et al., 2017). In addition, we previously observed large

461

differences in OmpT protein activity due to differential ompT expression (Thomassin,

462

Brannon, Gibbs, et al., 2012; Thomassin, Brannon, Kaiser, et al., 2012) suggesting that the

463

presence of the ompT gene may not entirely correlate with its activity levels in different

464

UPEC clinical isolates. In this study we hypothesized that OmpT activity correlates with

465

increased disease severity among UPEC clinical isolates. To test this hypothesis, we

466

systematically measured omptin activity in 58 E. coli isolates representing colonization and a

467

range of clinical outcomes. Increased omptin activity was correlated with clinical UPEC

468

strains isolated from patients with symptomatic UTIs (UTI and sepsis groups).

469
470

Omptin activity was heterogeneous among the clinical isolates, and could be related with

471

differential ompT expression and the presence of a second OmpT-like protease, arlC. For

472

example, a 20-fold difference in ompT expression was observed between isolates 5 and 11 of

473

the UTI group (Fig. 2B). This finding is not unprecedented, since it was previously shown

474

that ompT expression was 32-fold higher in EHEC than in EPEC (Thomassin, Brannon,

475

Gibbs, et al., 2012). Differential ompT expression-levels in EHEC and EPEC were attributed

476

to differences in distal promoter sequences found more than 150 bp upstream of the ompT

477

start codon (Thomassin, Brannon, Gibbs, et al., 2012). An EPEC-like ompT distal promoter

478

sequence and genomic context was also correlated with low OmpT activity in UPEC

479

reference strains (Brannon et al., 2013). Therefore, it was not surprising that the EPEC-like

480

promoter in cystitis (UTI) isolate 11 resulted in low ompT expression and OmpT activity. The

481

insertion of envY in the intergenic space between nfrA and ompT correlated with the increased

482

ompT expression and OmpT activity levels observed in cystitis (UTI) isolates 1 and 6 (Figs.

483

2BC and 3A). These data further suggest that variations in distal promoter sequences are

484

responsible for differential ompT expression and, in turn, proteolytic activity observed. It is

485

also possible that in addition to differences in the promoter regions, transcription factors or

486

post-transcriptional factors regulating ompT expression are absent or differentially expressed

487

in some isolates. Another explanation for heterogeneous omptin activity observed in this

488

study can be attributed to the presence of a second plasmid-encoded omptin, arlC, in some

489

isolates. The arlC gene was first identified as part of a large virulence plasmid of the AIEC

490

strain NRG857c (McPhee et al., 2014). BLAST searches in the NCBI database revealed that

491

arlC can also be found on plasmids harboured by various human ExPEC strains isolated from

492

patients with meningitis and sepsis, as well as avian E. coli strains (Appendix Fig. 2B). While

493

we did not detect ompP in our study, ompP is present in some UPEC strains that were

494

collected and sequenced by the Broad Institute ("E.coli UTI Bacteremia initiative," 2019).

495

This opens the possibility that any combination of ompT-like omptin may be present in a

496

given UPEC strain.

497
498

Omptins belonging to the OmpT-like subfamily are known to have subtle differences in

499

substrate specificity (Brannon, Thomassin, et al., 2015; Hwang et al., 2007; McCarter et al.,

500

2004). Studies using peptide libraries to compare OmpP and OmpT activity showed both

501

omptins preferentially cleave substrates between two consecutive basic residues, but that

502

OmpP appears to have a slight preference for Lys in the P and P’ sites (Hwang et al., 2007).

503

In addition to subtle differences in amino acid motif preference, peptide size and secondary

504

structure also impact substrate specificity (Brannon, Thomassin, et al., 2015; Haiko et al.,

505

2009; Hritonenko & Stathopoulos, 2007). For example, AMP α-helicity was shown to be a

506

determining factor for proteolytic activity of the OmpT-like omptin, CroP, from Citrobacter

507

rodentium (Brannon, Thomassin, et al., 2015). While ArlC, OmpP and OmpP all readily

508

cleave small unstructured substrates, such as the FRET substrate and C18G, differences in

509

cleavage efficiency were noted for larger or more structured AMPs. OmpP did not cleave

510

Magainin II as efficiently as C18G and did not cleave larger substrates such as mCRAMP,

511

LL-37 and RNase 7 (Figs. 4A, 5AB, 6B). These findings suggest that larger peptides might be

512

excluded from the OmpP active site. While OmpT and ArlC cleaved the FRET substrate,

513

C18G, Magainin II and mCRAMP relatively efficiently, there was a striking difference in LL-

514

37 and RNase 7 cleavage (Figs. 4A, 5A, 6B). Given the similarity in size of mCRAMP and

515

LL-37, and the ability of ArlC to cleave RNase 7, it is unlikely that the 3 amino acid size

516

difference accounts for the marked difference in cleavage efficiency. It is possible that ArlC

517

does not cleave α-helical AMPs, but instead cleaves unstructured and disulfide bond-

518

stabilized peptides. While this possibility requires further study, it is supported by the finding

519

that an arlC deletion strain is more susceptible to killing by human defensins (McPhee et al.,

520

2014). Altogether, these findings suggest the presence ArlC and OmpT in the same UPEC

521

isolate may confer a fitness advantage by expanding the spectrum of target substrates.

5 Conclusions

524

Here we show that increased omptin activity is associated with UPEC strains causing

525

symptomatic UTIs. Extensive heterogeneity of omptin activity among UPEC clinical isolates

526

was is due to variations in ompT expression and to the presence of a plasmid-encoded ompT-

527

like gene arlC. Our findings support current profiling practices of UPEC strains that include

528

the ompT gene (Johnson & Stell, 2000), but suggest that additional screening for arlC should

529

be considered as both genes were exclusively harboured in UPEC strains associated with

530

symptomatic infection. Altogether our findings suggest that the presence of two different

531

omptins in a UPEC strain may provide an additional fitness advantage by expanding the range

532

of AMPs cleaved during UTIs.

Figure 4. ArlC, OmpP and OmpT are functional in BL21. (A) BL21 containing empty

832

vector (ø) or plasmids encoding arlC, ompP or ompT were grown until mid-log phase and

833

normalized to OD595 0.5. Proteins from whole cell preparations or isolated bacterial outer

834

membranes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Omptins

835

were detected by western blot using anti-CroP polyclonal antibodies. (B) A synthetic FRET

836

peptide containing a dibasic motif (RK) was incubated with BL21 (open circles; control) or

837

BL21 expressing arlC (filled squares; ArlC), ompP (filled circles; OmpP) or ompT (filled

838

triangles; OmpT). Peptide cleavage, indicated by increased fluorescence, was monitored over

839

time. Data show the mean ± SD from triplicate samples and are representative of at least three

840

independent experiments. (C) Plasmin activation by ArlC, OmpP and OmpT. Glu-

841

plasminogen and VLKpNA (plasmin substrate) were incubated with BL21 (open circles;

842

control), BL21(ppla) (open triangles; Pla), BL21(parlC) (filled squares; ArlC), BL21(pompP)

843

(filled circles; OmpP), or BL21(pompT) (filled triangles; OmpT) strains. Absorbance at 405

844

nm was monitored over time. Data were normalized by subtracting initial absorbance from all

845

values. Data represent mean ± SD and are representative of at least three independent

846

experiments.
