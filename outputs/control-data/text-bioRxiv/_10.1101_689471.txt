Abstract
The insomniac (inc) gene is required for normal sleep in Drosophila and encodes a

26

conserved BTB protein that is a putative adaptor for the Cullin-3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase. Here

27

we test whether Inc serves as a Cul3 adaptor by generating mutant forms of Inc and assessing

28

their biochemical properties and physiological activity in vivo. We show that the N-terminal

29

BTB domain of Inc is necessary and sufficient for Inc self-association and interactions with

30

Cul3. Inc point mutations that weaken interactions with Cul3 impair the ability of Inc to rescue

31

the sleep deficits of inc mutants, indicating that Cul3-Inc binding is critical for Inc function in

32

vivo. Deletions of the conserved Inc C-terminus preserve Inc-Inc and Inc-Cul3 interactions but

33

abolish Inc activity in vivo, implicating the Inc C-terminus as an effector domain that recruits Inc

34

substrates. Mutation of a conserved C-terminal arginine similarly abolishes Inc function,

35

suggesting that this residue is vital for the recruitment or ubiquitination of Inc targets. Mutation

36

of the same residue in the human Inc ortholog KCTD17 is associated with myoclonic dystonia,

37

indicating its functional importance in Inc family members. Finally, we show that Inc assembles

38

into multimeric Cul3-Inc complexes in vivo and that depleting Cul3 causes accumulation of Inc,

39

suggesting that Inc is negatively regulated by Cul3-dependent autocatalytic ubiquitination, a

40

hallmark of Cullin adaptors. Our findings implicate Inc as a Cul3 adaptor and provide tools to

41

identify the targets of Inc family proteins that impact sleep and neurological disorders.

Introduction
Sleep is a conserved animal behavior regulated by genetic and molecular mechanisms

45

that remain elusive. Elucidating these mechanisms is a longstanding goal in biology, given that

46

the purpose of sleep is still not well understood and because alterations in these mechanisms may

47

cause sleep disturbances, including those associated with neurodegenerative and

48

neurodevelopmental disorders. Various genes that strongly influence the duration and

49

characteristics of sleep have been identified by unbiased genetic screens in flies (Afonso et al.,

50

2015; Cirelli et al., 2005; Koh et al., 2008; Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012; Rogulja and Young,

51

2012; Stavropoulos and Young, 2011; Toda et al., 2019), zebrafish (Chiu et al., 2016; Singh et

52

al., 2017), worms (Iannacone et al., 2017), and mice (Funato et al., 2016). While many of these

53

genes function in pathways governing neuronal excitability or neurotransmission (Chiu et al.,

54

2016; Cirelli et al., 2005; Koh et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2017; M. Wu et al., 2014; M. N. Wu et

55

al., 2010), others influence sleep by mechanisms that remain poorly understood.

56

insomniac (inc) mutations strongly curtail the duration and consolidation of sleep but do

57

not alter its circadian regulation (Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012; Stavropoulos and Young,

58

2011). inc activity is required in neurons for normal sleep, and conversely, restoring inc solely to

59

neurons is largely sufficient to rescue the sleep deficits of inc mutants (Pfeiffenberger and

60

Allada, 2012; Stavropoulos and Young, 2011). While these findings indicate that inc influences

61

sleep primarily through neurons, the molecular mechanisms by which inc functions remain

62

poorly defined. inc encodes a conserved protein of the Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, Broad Complex

63

(BTB) domain superfamily (Stavropoulos and Young, 2011), which comprises more than 80

64

proteins in Drosophila (Stogios et al., 2005). The BTB domain mediates protein-protein

65

interactions including homomeric self-associations and binding to heterologous proteins (Stogios

66

et al., 2005). BTB-domain containing proteins cluster into distinct subfamilies based on sequence

67

variation within the BTB domain and the presence of additional domains that underlie diverse

68

cellular functions (Stogios et al., 2005). BTB proteins include transcriptional regulators (DiBello

69

et al., 1991; Godt et al., 1993; Harrison and Travers, 1990), ion channels (Butler et al., 1989;

70

Papazian et al., 1987; Pongs et al., 1988; Wei et al., 1990), auxiliary subunits of GABAB

71

receptors (Schwenk et al., 2010), and adaptors for the Cullin-3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase (Furukawa

72

et al., 2003; Pintard et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2003).

73

Indirect evidence suggests that Inc may serve as a substrate adaptor for the Cul3 ubiquitin

74

ligase complex (Li et al., 2017; Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012; Stavropoulos and Young,

75

2011). BTB proteins that function as Cul3 adaptors form homomultimers that bind Cul3 and

76

recruit substrates to Cul3 complexes for ubiquitination (Furukawa et al., 2003; Geyer et al.,

77

2003; Pintard et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2003). In cultured cells, Inc is able to bind Cul3

78

(Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012; Stavropoulos and Young, 2011) and to self-associate (Li et al.,

79

2017; Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012), but whether these molecular interactions occur in vivo

80

or are necessary for the physiological activity of Inc is unknown. Neuronal depletion of either inc

81

or Cul3 causes short sleep (Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012; Stavropoulos and Young, 2011),

82

consistent with the notion that Cul3 and inc influence sleep through a common pathway, yet the

83

modular nature of Cul3 complexes leaves unclear whether Cul3 impacts sleep through Inc. Cul3

84

assembles with tens of different BTB adaptors to ubiquitinate hundreds of substrates (Emanuele

85

et al., 2011), and may impinge upon sleep through multiple adaptor and substrate pathways. In

86

the absence of functional evidence linking Inc and Cul3 in a concerted mechanism that

87

influences sleep, the role of Inc as Cul3 adaptor remains speculative.

88

Here, we have generated mutant forms of Inc to test the hypothesis that Inc impacts sleep

89

by functioning as a Cul3 adaptor. Analysis of these Inc mutants in cultured cells and in vivo

90

reveals that Inc has the biochemical properties and molecular interactions expected of a Cul3

91

adaptor. The N-terminal BTB domain of Inc mediates interactions with Cul3 and homomeric

92

self-associations. Weakening Cul3-Inc associations impairs Inc activity in vivo, indicating that

93

Inc function requires the assembly of Cul3-Inc complexes. Deletion of the conserved C-terminal

94

domain of Inc abolishes Inc function in vivo, as does a missense mutation of a conserved,

95

disease-associated arginine residue in the C-terminal domain. These findings identify the Inc C-

96

terminus as a putative substrate binding domain and define a region within the C-terminus likely

97

to bind substrates. Mutation of the same residue in KCTD17, a human ortholog of Inc, is

98

associated with myoclonic dystonia (Mencacci et al., 2015), indicating its functional importance

99

across Inc family proteins. Our findings reveal that Inc influences sleep by functioning as an

100

adaptor for the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex. More broadly, our studies provide structural and

101

functional insights into Inc family proteins and tools to identify their substrates that impact

102

neuronal function and behavior.

Results

106

The Inc BTB domain mediates Cul3 binding and Inc homomultimerization

107

Inc and its orthologs have two conserved domains, an N-terminal BTB domain and a C-

108

terminal domain unique to Inc family members (Figures 1A and S1A) (Dementieva et al., 2009;

109

Stavropoulos and Young, 2011). The BTB domains of Cul3 adaptors mediate Cul3 binding and

110

adaptor multimerization, while distal domains recruit substrates (Furukawa et al., 2003; Geyer et

111

al., 2003; Pintard et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2003). To test whether Inc domains have the biochemical

112

properties expected of a Cul3 adaptor, we generated a deletion series in which Inc is truncated

113

progressively from its N- or C-terminus (Figure 1A). We first assessed the stability of these Inc

114

derivatives and their associations with Cul3 by expressing epitope-tagged forms of these proteins

115

in S2 cells and performing co-immunoprecipitations. Deleting residues preceding the BTB domain

116

(Inc22-211) did not significantly alter interactions with Cul3 or the stability of Inc (Figure 1B). In

117

contrast, removing part of the BTB domain (Inc31-211) or deleting the BTB domain entirely (Inc124-

118

211

119

terminal truncations of Inc did not alter Cul3 binding or Inc stability. Inc proteins lacking 25 C-

120

terminal residues (Inc1-186), most of the C-terminal domain (Inc1-156), or all residues following the

121

BTB domain (Inc1-123) associated with Cul3 similarly to full-length Inc (Figure 1B), indicating that

122

the Inc C-terminus is dispensable for Inc-Cul3 interactions. The isolated Inc BTB domain (Inc22-

124

of Inc1-123 (Figure 1B), suggesting that Inc N-terminal residues contribute to Cul3 binding.

125

Alternatively, weaker binding of Inc22-123 to Cul3 might reflect an inhibitory effect of fusing the

126

3×FLAG tag to the isolated BTB domain. Together, these results indicate that the Inc BTB domain

is necessary and sufficient for Cul3 binding, a key property expected of a Cul3 adaptor.

128

Next, we assessed the ability of truncated Inc proteins to associate with full length Inc.

129

Partial deletion of the Inc BTB domain (Inc31-211) or its complete removal (Inc124-211) abolished

130

Inc-Inc interactions (Figure 1C). The reduction in Inc stability caused by truncating the BTB

131

domain (Figures 1B and 1C) suggests that Inc is an obligate homomultimer and that Inc monomers

132

are intrinsically unstable. In contrast, C-terminal truncations of Inc did not detectably alter Inc-Inc

133

associations (Figure 1C), indicating that the Inc C-terminus is dispensable for Inc multimerization.

134

The Inc BTB domain (Inc22-123) was sufficient to bind Inc (Figure 1C), albeit more weakly than

135

Inc1-123, suggesting that N-terminal Inc residues contribute to Inc-Inc interactions or that

136

interactions of the isolated BTB domain are occluded by the 3×FLAG tag. We conclude that the

137

Inc BTB domain mediates Inc self-association and Cul3 binding and that the Inc C-terminus is

138

dispensable for these interactions.

139
140

Identification of Inc point mutants that selectively weaken Inc-Cul3 and Inc-Inc interactions

141

We next sought to identify Inc point mutants that selectively perturb Inc-Cul3 and Inc-Inc

142

interactions, in order to test the necessity of these interactions for Inc activity in vivo. Our efforts

143

to mutagenize Inc were informed by the crystal structure of human KCTD5, an Inc ortholog that

144

forms homopentamers (Dementieva et al., 2009), and by the structures of Cul3 complexed with

145

BTB-MATH and BTB-BACK-Kelch adaptors (Canning et al., 2013; Errington et al., 2012; Ji and

146

Privé, 2013), in which adaptors form homodimers and assemble with Cul3 in a 2:2 stoichiometry

147

(Canning et al., 2013; Errington et al., 2012; Ji and Privé, 2013). While Inc and its orthologs are

148

divergent from BTB-MATH and BTB-BACK-Kelch adaptors and likely bind Cul3 with a different

149

mechanism and stoichiometry (Balasco et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2015), comparison of these structures

150

suggested a region of Inc that may bind Cul3. We selected eight residues in the Inc BTB domain

151

that are conserved between Inc and its three human orthologs and that reside on the solvent-

152

accessible surface of KCTD5 (Figures S1A and S1B), reasoning that these residues may contribute

153

to Cul3 binding. We mutated these residues individually to alanine (F47A, D57A, D61A, F105A,

154

Y106A, N107A) or to oppositely charged residues (R50E, E104K), and assessed the consequences

155

for Inc-Inc and Inc-Cul3 interactions in cultured S2 cells. Most mutants did not detectably alter

156

Inc self-association or Cul3 binding (Table 1). Two mutants, F47A and F105A, weakened

157

interactions with Cul3 but did not significantly affect Inc self-association or stability (Figures 2A

158

and 2B). A double mutant combining F47A and F105A behaved similarly and selectively impaired

159

Cul3 binding (Figures 2A and 2B). These phenylalanine residues cluster in a hydrophobic patch

160

on the surface of KCTD5 that may be buried upon Cul3 binding (Figure S1B). This patch is distinct

161

from the interface of adjacent KCTD5 subunits, consistent with the lack of a measurable impact

162

of mutating F47 and F105 on Inc-Inc interactions (Figure 2B).

163

To identify Inc mutants that impair Inc-Inc homomultimerization, we mutated seven

164

conserved residues that form a network of polar and charged interactions between adjacent KCTD5

165

subunits (Dementieva et al., 2009) (Figures S1A and S1C). We mutated these residues to alanine

166

(T36A, D71A, D73A, N82A) or to oppositely charged residues (R85E, K88D, E101K) in single

167

and double mutant combinations. None of these single or double mutants significantly altered Inc

168

self-associations in S2 cells (Table 2). We reasoned that Inc may form homopentamers, like

169

KCTD5, and that cooperative interactions between Inc subunits might limit the effects of these

170

mutations. We therefore generated a triple point mutant predicted to disrupt interactions of Inc

171

subunits with both flanking neighbors in a putative Inc pentamer (T36A, D71A, R85E) (Figure

172

S1C). This triple mutant exhibited significantly weakened interactions with both Inc and Cul3 and

173

a markedly reduced stability (Figures 2C and 2D), resembling the consequences of deleting the

174

Inc BTB domain (Figures 1B and 1C). These findings support the conclusion that multimerization-

175

deficient Inc proteins are unstable and suggest that Inc multimerization is required for efficient

176

Cul3 binding. These results furthermore suggest that Cul3 binds cooperatively to adjacent Inc

177

subunits and that Cul3-Inc complexes have an architecture distinct from Cul3-adaptor complexes

178

formed by BTB-MATH and BTB-BACK-Kelch proteins (Canning et al., 2013; Errington et al.,

179

2012; Ji and Privé, 2013).

180
181

The assembly of Inc-Cul3 complexes in vivo is required for the function of Inc

182

Inc mutations that selectively impair Cul3 binding represent key tools to assess whether

183

Inc impacts sleep by functioning as a Cul3 adaptor. To assess the physiological activity of Inc

184

mutants in vivo, we generated UAS transgenes expressing 3´FLAG-Inc or -Inc point mutants that

185

weaken Cul3 interactions: IncF47A, IncF105A, and IncF47A/F105A. We integrated these transgenes at the

186

same genomic site (attP2) and backcrossed them to generate an isogenic allelic series, enabling

187

careful comparisons of their activity. We first assessed the expression of these proteins using inc-

188

Gal4, a driver that fully rescues the sleep deficits of inc mutants when used to restore inc

189

expression (Li et al., 2017; Stavropoulos and Young, 2011) and which therefore recapitulates inc

190

expression in cells relevant for sleep. Inc and Inc point mutants were expressed at similar levels

191

under inc-Gal4 control in inc mutants (Figure 3A) or inc+ animals (Figure S2A), indicating that

192

these point mutants do not alter Inc stability in vivo, recapitulating findings from cultured cells

193

(Figures 2A and 2B). Next, we assessed the impact of expressing Inc point mutants on sleep-wake

194

behavior. Because adaptor proteins deficient for Cul3 interactions might sequester substrates and

195

thus function as dominant negatives, we first tested whether the sleep of inc+ animals was altered

196

by the expression of Inc point mutants. Animals expressing Inc point mutants under the pan-

197

neuronal elavc155-Gal4 control slept indistinguishably from those expressing wild-type Inc and

198

from control animals lacking UAS transgenes (Figure S2B). Thus, expression of Inc point mutants

199

in neurons does not elicit dominant negative effects or antagonize endogenous Inc function.

200

We next tested whether Inc-Cul3 interactions are required for Inc function in vivo. If so,

201

attenuating these interactions should impair the ability of Inc to rescue the sleep phenotypes of inc

202

mutants. While Inc expressed with inc-Gal4 fully rescued the short sleep of inc1 null mutants, Inc

203

mutants that weaken Inc-Cul3 interactions provided only a partial rescue (Figures 3B and 3C),

204

supporting the interpretation that Inc activity in vivo requires binding to the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase

205

complex. Rescue was more strongly impaired for IncF105A and IncF47A/F105A than IncF47A (Figures

206

3B and S3A-D). Because these Inc mutants are expressed at similar levels in vivo (Figure 3A), we

207

speculate that the F47A mutation might impair Cul3 binding in vivo to a lesser degree than in S2

208

cells. Collectively, the impaired rescuing activity of this trio of Inc mutants suggests that Inc

209

activity requires the assembly of Cul3-Inc complexes in vivo and that disruption of these

210

complexes inhibits sleep.

211
212

The conserved C-terminal domain of Inc is essential for Inc activity in vivo

213

While the Inc C-terminus is dispensable for Inc-Inc and Inc-Cul3 associations (Figures 1B

214

and 1C), its evolutionary conservation suggests an essential function. If Inc serves as a Cul3

215

adaptor, its C-terminus is predicted to bind substrates and recruit them to the Cul3 complex for

216

ubiquitination. To test whether the C-terminus is required for physiological function of Inc in vivo,

217

we generated UAS transgenes expressing 3×FLAG-tagged Inc C-terminal truncations: Inc1-186,

218

Inc1-156, and Inc1-123. These proteins were expressed at similar levels under inc-Gal4 control in inc

219

mutants (Figure 4A), indicating that these proteins are stable in vivo, as in cultured cells (Figures

220

1B and 1C). Neuronal expression of Inc C-terminal truncations using elavc155-Gal4 did not

221

significantly alter sleep, indicating that these proteins do not elicit dominant negative effects or

222

antagonize endogenous inc function (Figure S4).

223

To determine whether the Inc C-terminus is essential for Inc function, we tested whether

224

C-terminally truncated Inc proteins rescue the sleep deficits of inc mutants. Wild-type Inc

225

expressed under inc-Gal4 control fully rescued the sleep deficits of inc1 mutants (Figures 4B and

226

4C). In contrast, animals expressing Inc1-156 or Inc1-123 slept indistinguishably from inc mutants,

227

indicating that these proteins failed to rescue the inc phenotype (Figures 4B and 4C). Expression

228

of Inc1-186 partially rescued the sleep phenotypes of inc mutants as assessed by several sleep

229

parameters, including total sleep duration (Figure 4B), nighttime and daytime sleep (Figures S5A

230

and S5B), and sleep bout duration and number (Figures S5C and S5D). These findings indicate

231

that the Inc C-terminus is essential for Inc activity in vivo and that removing the terminal 25

232

residues of Inc curtails Inc function. The stability of C-terminally truncated Inc proteins and their

233

ability to engage normally in Inc-Cul3 and Inc-Inc interactions (Figures 1B and 1C), supports the

234

hypothesis that the Inc C-terminus recruits Inc binding partners including substrates whose

235

ubiquitination influences sleep.

236
237

Mutation of a conserved disease-associated arginine in the Inc C-terminus abolishes Inc

238

function and defines a region of Inc likely to recruit substrates

239

To further dissect the function of the Inc C-terminus, we mutated several conserved

240

residues whose attributes suggested they might contribute to Inc function. A missense mutation of

241

a conserved C-terminal arginine in the human Inc ortholog KCTD17 (R145H) is associated with

242

a dominant form of myoclonic dystonia, a neurological movement disorder (Mencacci et al., 2015).

243

We reasoned that this arginine residue might be critical for the function of Inc and its orthologs.

244

In particular, the analogous residue in KCTD5 (R159) resides on a lateral solvent-accessible

245

surface of the C-terminal domain that might bind and orient substrates for Cul3-dependent

246

ubiquitination (Figure S1D). We therefore generated the analogous mutation in Inc (IncR135H) to

247

assess whether it impacts Inc function. We also mutated three conserved Inc residues (N167, Y168,

248

G169) to alanine (IncAAA), reasoning that their location within a surface-exposed loop on the

249

bottom surface of the KCTD5 C-terminus and their conservation amid flanking non-conserved

250

residues (Figures S1A and S1D) might reflect an important function. In cultured S2 cells, both

251

IncR135H and IncAAA were stably expressed and associated with Cul3 and Inc indistinguishably from

wild-type Inc, indicating that these mutations do not alter Inc multimerization or Cul3 binding

253

(Figure 5).

254

To determine whether IncR135H and IncAAA alter the physiological activity of Inc, we

255

generated UAS transgenes to express these mutants in vivo. As in cultured cells, IncR135H and

256

IncAAA were stably expressed in vivo (Figure 6A). Expression of IncR135H and IncAAA with elavc155-

257

Gal4 did not alter sleep in inc+ animals, indicating that these proteins do not have dominant

258

negative activity or inhibit endogenous Inc function (Figure S6). Next, we tested whether IncR135H

259

and IncAAA were able to rescue the sleep deficits of inc mutants. IncR135H was unable to restore

260

sleep to inc1 mutants, indicating that the R135H mutation abolishes Inc function (Figures 6B-C

261

and S7A-D). In contrast, IncAAA completely rescued inc1 mutants and behaved indistinguishably

262

from wild-type Inc (Figures 6B-C and S7A-D). These data indicate that R135 is critical for Inc

263

function and suggest that mutation of this residue impairs the recruitment of Inc binding partners

264

including substrates. The analogous mutation in KCTD17 may similarly alter its ability to engage

Inc exhibits properties of a Cul3 adaptor in neurons in vivo

269

Neuronal depletion of inc or Cul3 shortens sleep, indicating that the activity of both genes

270

is required in neurons for normal sleep (Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012; Stavropoulos and Young,

271

2011). We performed a series of experiments to determine whether Inc exhibits the properties of

272

a Cul3 adaptor in vivo. First, we tested whether Cul3-Inc complexes assemble in vivo, by co-

273

expressing epitope-tagged Inc and Cul3 in neurons using the elavc155-Gal4 driver and performing

274

co-immunoprecipitations. We observed that Cul3 and Inc associate in neurons in vivo (Figure 7A).

275

Second, we tested whether Inc homomultimerizes in vivo, by co-expressing HA-Inc and Myc-Inc

276

in neurons and assessing their physical interactions. We observed strong self-association of Inc in

277

neurons (Figure 7B), indicating that Inc forms homomultimeric complexes in vivo, as in cultured

278

cells (Figure 1C) (Li et al., 2017; Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012). Third, we tested whether Inc

279

abundance is regulated by Cul3 in vivo. Cul3 adaptors are often regulated by autocatalytic

280

ubiquitination and degradation in Cul3 complexes (Djagaeva and Doronkin, 2009; Geyer et al.,

281

2003; Hudson and Cooley, 2010; Pintard et al., 2003; Wee et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005). To test

282

whether Inc abundance is regulated by Cul3 activity, we expressed neuronal RNAi against Cul3

283

and assessed Inc levels in head lysates. We observed an increase in Inc protein levels upon

284

depletion of Cul3 (Figure 7C), indicating that Cul3 negatively regulates Inc in adult neurons. qRT-

285

PCR revealed that neuronal Cul3 RNAi did not increase inc transcript levels, indicating that

286

elevated Inc levels arise by a post-transcriptional mechanism (Figure 7D). We conclude that Inc is

287

regulated endogenously in neurons by Cul3-dependent autocatalytic ubiquitination and subsequent

expected of a Cul3 adaptor in neurons, a cell type through which inc influences sleep

Discussion

293

The neuronal activity of Insomniac is vital for sleep, yet the molecular mechanism

294

underlying its function has remained speculative. Our analysis implicates Inc as a Cul3 adaptor in

295

vivo and provides insight into the mechanism by which Inc binds Cul3 and recruits substrates to

296

ultimately impact behavior. Inc has a modular organization and conserved domains that fulfill the

297

properties expected of a Cul3 adaptor (Furukawa et al., 2003; Geyer et al., 2003; Pintard et al.,

298

2003; Xu et al., 2003). The Inc BTB domain mediates the homomeric assembly of Inc and

299

interactions with Cul3, while the Inc C-terminus is dispensable for these interactions but is vital

300

for Inc function in vivo, consistent with its putative function in recruiting substrates to Cul3-Inc

301

complexes for ubiquitination. Inc assembles into Cul3-Inc complexes in neurons and importantly,

302

reducing the affinity of Inc-Cul3 associations impairs the activity of Inc in vivo. These findings

303

link the biochemical associations of Cul3 and Inc to prior findings that normal sleep-wake cycles

304

require the activity of both proteins in neurons (Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012; Stavropoulos and

305

Young, 2011). The negative regulation of Inc by Cul3 in neurons is characteristic of autocatalytic

306

degradation exhibited by Cul3 adaptors (Djagaeva and Doronkin, 2009; Geyer et al., 2003; Hudson

307

and Cooley, 2010; Pintard et al., 2003; Wee et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005), providing further

308

support for the function of Inc as a Cul3 adaptor in cells through which Inc impacts sleep.

309

Our data and prior studies (Balasco et al., 2014; Dementieva et al., 2009; Ji et al., 2015)

310

suggest that Inc forms an obligate homopentamer in which neighboring Inc subunits interact

311

cooperatively. Consistent with a pentameric structure for Inc, a triple mutation altering opposite

312

sides of Inc and thus its interactions with both neighboring subunits severely compromised Inc

313

multimerization. Inc multimerization is furthermore required for efficient Cul3 binding, suggesting

314

that Cul3 binds cooperatively to the BTB domains of neighboring Inc subunits. Such a mechanism

315

is consistent with the consequences of mutating conserved phenylalanine residues (F47 and F105)

316

near this interface, which impair Cul3 binding and Inc function in vivo. It is perhaps surprising

317

that Inc mutants that impair Cul3 interactions do not elicit dominant negative phenotypes when

318

overexpressed, although we note that these mutants retain some ability to bind Cul3. Similarly, Inc

319

overexpression might be expected to sequester substrates but does not alter sleep (Li et al., 2017;

320

Stavropoulos and Young, 2011). We speculate that robust Inc homomultimerization may buffer

321

Cul3-Inc complexes against perturbations in Inc abundance and contribute, along with additional

322

mechanisms that regulate Inc activity, to the permissive influence that Inc exerts on sleep.

323

Our functional analysis of the Inc C-terminus provides insight into the mechanism by

324

which Inc is likely to bind substrates and orient them for ubiquitination in Cul3 complexes. The

325

Inc C-terminus is dispensable for Cul3 binding and Inc multimerization, yet is absolutely essential

326

for Inc function in vivo, implicating it as a substrate recruitment domain. We furthermore

327

identified a conserved, surface-exposed arginine residue (R135) within the Inc C-terminus

328

required for Inc activity in vivo. Mutation of this residue is behaviorally indistinguishable from

329

deleting the Inc C-terminus and does not alter Inc stability, suggesting that it does not disrupt the

330

structure of the C-terminal domain. While our results do not exclude the possibility that this residue

331

is essential for Inc trafficking or other mechanisms that might regulate Inc activity, the simplest

332

possibility suggested by its position on the lateral surface of the Inc C-terminus is that it contributes

333

directly to binding targets that impact sleep. A missense mutation of the same residue in the human

334

Inc ortholog KCTD17 (R145H) is associated with myoclonic dystonia (Mencacci et al., 2015),

335

suggesting a similar functional importance for substrate recruitment in Inc orthologs. The partial

336

functional impairment of Inc caused by removing C-terminal residues (Inc1-186) is consistent with

337

the possibility that they contribute to substrate binding. These residues are not resolved in the

338

KCTD5 crystal structure (Dementieva et al., 2009), suggesting that they are flexible in the absence

339

of substrates and may become structured upon substrate binding. While a parsimonious model is

340

that Inc directly binds substrates, our findings do not rule out more complex models of substrate

341

recruitment that require co-adaptor proteins, analogous to the mechanism recently described for

342

KLHL12, a BTB-Kelch family adaptor (McGourty et al., 2016). Further studies are required to

343

elucidate Inc substrates and distinguish among these models.

344

Our recent findings revealed that orthologs of Inc can substitute for Inc in flies and

345

restore sleep to inc mutants, suggesting that the functions and targets of Inc and its orthologs are

346

evolutionarily conserved (Li et al., 2017). Our present studies provide evidence for the function

347

of Inc as a Cul3 adaptor in vivo and the foundation for identifying Inc substrates. While

348

substrates for Inc orthologs have been recently described in cultured cells (Brockmann et al.,

349

2017; Kasahara et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2017), whether these targets or other proteins mediate the

350

impact of Cul3 and Inc on sleep remains unknown. Elucidating Inc substrates and the

351

downstream pathways will advance our understanding of how protein ubiquitination pathways

352

contribute to the regulation of nervous system function and mechanisms underlying behavior.

pUASTattB–Myc-Inc (pNS346) encodes an N-terminal Myc epitope

477

(MEQKLISEEDLAS) fused to Inc, as previously described (Li et al., 2017).

478

pUASTattB–Myc-IncR135H (pNS428) was generated by ligating a HindIII-XhoI digested

479

pNS346 backbone and a HindIII-XhoI IncR135H fragment. The IncR135H fragment was liberated

480

from the fusion PCR amplification product of primers oNS1126 and oNS1127 and an equimolar

481

mix of overlapping 5’ and 3’ IncR135H fragments as template. The 5’ and 3’ fragments were

482

generated by PCR amplification of pNS346 template with primers oNS1126/oNS1555 and

483

oNS1127/oNS1554, respectively.

484

pUASTattB–Myc-IncAAA (pNS429) was generated similarly as pNS428, substituting a

485

HindIII-XhoI IncAAA fragment. The IncAAA fragment was generated similarly as IncR135H,

486

substituting primers oNS1126/oNS1557 and oNS1127/oNS1556 for generating the 5’ and 3’

487

IncAAA fragments, respectively.

488

pUAST–Inc-HA (pNS273) encodes Inc fused to a C-terminal HA epitope

489

(GSYPYDVPDYA) and was generated by three piece ligation of pUAST BglII-XhoI, a BglII-

490

EcoRI inc fragment liberated from pNS272 (Stavropoulos and Young, 2011), and an EcoRI-

491

XhoI HA fragment generated by phosphorylating and annealing oligonucleotides oNS191 and

492

oNS192.

493

pUASTattB–3×FLAG-Inc (pNS404) encodes an N-terminal 3×FLAG epitope

494

(MDYKDDDDKGSDYKDDDDKGSDYKDDDDKAS) fused to Inc and was generated by three

495

piece ligation of EcoRI-XhoI digested pUASTattB, an EcoRI-NheI 3×FLAG fragment liberated

496

from the PCR amplification product of pNS311 template and primers ACF and oNS241, and a

497

NheI-XhoI inc fragment liberated from pNS351.

Cell culture and biochemistry
S2 cells were cultured in S2 media containing 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin,

585

and were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen) as described previously (Stavropoulos and Young,

586

2011). Transfections were performed in 6 well plates for ~24 hr, after which liposome-

587

containing media was replaced with fresh culture media. 400 ng of total DNA was used for each

588

transfection. For transfections involving two plasmids, an equal amount of each was used. Empty

589

vector lacking insert was used to equalize DNA amounts as indicated in Figures . Cells were

591

NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40) containing protease

592

inhibitors. Protein extracts were quantitated in duplicate (BioRad, 5000111).

593

For co-immunoprecipitations of truncated Inc proteins from S2 cells, 700-1000 µg total

594

protein was incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:100 anti-FLAG (Sigma, F1804) or anti-Myc

595

(Sigma, C3956) antibody. Complexes were precipitated by incubation with Gammabind G

596

sepharose beads (Life Technologies, 10-1243) for 1 hr at 4°C on a nutator, washed 4×5 min at

597

4°C with lysis buffer, and denatured in SDS sample buffer, separated on Tris SDS-PAGE gels,

598

and transferred to nitrocellulose. For co-immunoprecipitations of Inc point mutant proteins from

599

S2 cells, 450-1000 µg of total protein was immunoprecipitated overnight with 20 µl (50% slurry)

600

of anti-FLAG (Sigma, F2426) affinity gel at 4°C on a nutator. Samples were then washed 4×5

601

min at 4°C with lysis buffer, denatured in SDS sample buffer, separated on Tris SDS-PAGE

602

gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked for 1-1.5 hr at room temperature

603

in LI-COR Odyssey buffer (LI-COR, 927-40000). Membranes were subsequently incubated in

604

blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and the appropriate primary antibodies for 1-2 hr at

Crosses were set with five virgin females and three males on cornmeal, agar, and

651

molasses food. One to four day old male flies eclosing from LD-entrained cultures raised at 25°C

652

were loaded in glass tubes containing cornmeal, agar, and molasses food. Animals were

monitored for 5-7 days at 25°C in LD cycles using DAM2 monitors (Trikinetics). The first 36-48

654

hours of data were discarded and an integral number of days of data (3-5) were analyzed using

655

custom Matlab code. Locomotor data were collected in 1 min bins. Sleep was defined by

656

locomotor inactivity for 5 min or more; all minutes within inactive periods exceeding 5 min were

657

assigned as sleep. This definition classifies more sleep than the definition used in our prior
