Abstract

17

Wild relatives of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) are the reservoirs of novel allelic

18

diversity with great potential to improve many agronomic traits in wheat. Here, we

19

investigated the genome-wide patterns and efficiency of Aegilops tauschii allele introgression

20

into the winter wheat cultivars. The introgression population of 351 BC1F3:5 lines was

21

selected based on phenology and development characteristics from crosses between six

22

hexaploid wheat lines and 21 wheat-Ae. tauschii octoploids. Complexity reduced genomic

23

library sequencing was used to develop SNP markers and infer the regions of identity-by-

24

descent and the boundaries of the introgressed segments. Using a diverse panel of 116 Ae.

25

tauschii accessions, it was possible to infer that introgression lines had single or multiple IBD

26

segments from accessions of diverse geographic origin. Introgression frequency was high at

27

the ends of chromosomes and low in the large pericentromeric 2/3 of the chromosome arms

28

characterized by low crossover rate. While the effect of selection for free-threshing genotypes

29

was evident around the domestication gene Tg, reduction in the frequency of introgression

30

was limited to relatively small regions flanking the gene. These results suggest that the

31

effects of phenotypic selection on the introgressed wild relative’s alleles at the early

32

generations of population development are strongly influenced by the distribution of

33

crossover frequency across genome, consistent with the Hill-Robertson effect. Our study

34

offers insights into the introgression population development to ensure retention of genetic

Introduction

40

Wheat production is constrained by several biotic and abiotic factors, yet the demand

41

for wheat is expected to double by 2050. A yield increase of ~2.4 % per year has been

42

projected as required to close the gap between the current production level and an increasing

43

demand (Ray et al. 2013). While this goal can be achieved by improving agronomic

44

practices, expanding the production area and/or deployment of high-yielding wheat varieties,

45

the first two alternatives are unsustainable because land is a limited resource and most

46

effective agronomic practices are costly. Accelerated wheat improvement through extensive

47

deployment of available genomics tools and genetic resources, including close and distant

48

wild relatives of wheat, is viewed as the most effective and sustainable alternative to

49

increasing yield.

50

Allohexaploid wheat, Triticum aestivum (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) resulted from

51

hybridization of Triticum turgidum (2n = 4x = 28, AABB) and Aegilops tauschii ssp.

52

strangulata (2n = 2x = 14, DD) (Kihara 1944; Luo et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2013).

53

Domestication of wheat followed by continuous selection by early farmers led to the

54

‘domestication syndrome’ that resulted in fixation or loss of alleles from the populations of

55

wild relatives (Peng et al. 2003; Haudry et al. 2007; Dvorak et al. 2012). The wild diploid

56

and tetraploid relatives that carry homoeologous genomes such as Triticum turgidum ssp.

57

dicoccoides (AB genomes), T. monococcum (A genome), T. urartu (A genome), Ae. tauschii

58

ssp. tauschii (D genome), and Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata (D genome) are the primary

59

sources of genes for improvement of common wheat (Gill and Raupp 1987; Qi et al. 2007).

60

Secondary sources of resistance genes are close relatives of hexaploid wheat such as T.

61

timopheevii (2n = 4x = 28, AAGG) and Ae. speltoides (2n = 2x = 14, SS). Introgression of

62

beneficial alleles from these wild relatives was achieved by homoeologous recombination

63

between the chromosomes of common wheat and wild relatives in the absence of Ph1 gene

64

controlling the pairing between homoeologs (Sears 1977). Introgression involves either direct

65

crosses between common wheat and wild relatives or crosses between common wheat and

66

synthetic wheat lines that are generated by hybridizing tetraploid wheat and wild diploids (Qi

67

et al. 2007; Ogbonnaya et al. 2013).

68

Direct crossing of wild relatives to common wheat followed by backcrosses to the

69

recurrent common wheat parent has been reported as a faster approach for introducing traits

70

(Alonso and Kimber 1984; Gill and Raupp 1987). This approach was successfully used to

71

transfer resistance to Hessian fly, greenbug and leaf rust into wheat (Gill and Raupp 1987).

72

The D genome from Ae. tauschii has been associated with important adaptation traits such as

73

drought and salinity stress tolerance, increased yield by influencing various yield components

74

as well as grain, flour and dough quality (Ogbonnaya et al. 2013; Jones et al. 2013). Several

75

genes that confer resistance to stem rust and leaf rust have been identified on D chromosomes

76

in bread wheat landraces or their relatives (Liu et al. 2013; Periyannan et al. 2013). Other

77

members of the Triticeae family have been utilized as a tertiary genetic pool for wheat

78

improvement via non-homoeologous recombination (alien introgression). Many major

79

disease resistance and environmental adaptation genes have been introgressed into wheat by

80

translocation of chromosome segments and addition of full chromosomes or chromosome

81

arms from rye, Agropyron, Ae. ventricosa and other species (Ayliffe et al. 2008; Liu et al.

82

2011; McIntosh et al. 2015; Cruz et al. 2016).

83

Improvement of wheat via alien genome introgression and homoeologous

84

recombination can be challenging due to linkage drag of unwanted alleles from the wild

85

relatives’ genomes that can negatively impact agronomic traits (Anugrahwati et al. 2008).

86

Genes affecting plant growth, development and domestication traits, such as dwarfing gene

87

Rht1, photoperiod response gene Ppd-D1, tenacious glume gene Tg, and domestication gene

88

Q have been mapped on chromosome arms 4DS, 2DS, 2BS and 5AL (Peng et al. 1999;

89

Jantasuriyarat et al. 2004; Simons et al. 2006; Beales et al. 2007; Sood et al. 2009).

90

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) from chromosome 4A, 4B, 6B and 7B have also been reported

91

to confer free-threshability in wheat recombinant inbred lines (Jantasuriyarat et al. 2004;

92

Peleg et al. 2011). The analyses of SNPs around genes affecting domestication traits showed

93

substantial reduction of genetic diversity, which was indicative of strong positive selection

94

for the domesticated allelic variants (He et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019).

95

Genotyping approaches based on next-generation sequencing of complexity-reduced

96

genomic libraries substantially accelerated analysis of genetic diversity in large crop genomes

97

(Elshire et al. 2011; Saintenac et al. 2011; Poland et al. 2012; Saintenac et al. 2013; Jordan et

98

al. 2015, 2018). The high proportion of missing data in low-coverage sequencing datasets

99

was compensated by the availability of the whole genome sequence (The International Wheat

100

Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) 2018) that facilitated accurate genotype

101

imputation. Imputation of ungenotyped SNP markers from a reference panel into a target

102

population takes advantage of regions of identity-by-descent (IBD), thus allowing the

103

interpolation of SNPs into the target population (Browning and Browning 2013). The power

104

and resolution of association studies have been shown to improve after imputation (Browning

105

and Browning 2012; Jordan et al. 2015; Nyine et al. 2019).

106

In this study, we developed the populations of winter wheat lines carrying

107

introgression from a diverse set of Ae. tauschii accessions selected to represent broad genetic

108

and geographic diversity of the species. The boundaries of introgressed segments in wheat

109

genome were detected using the IBD analyses based on the SNP datasets generated by

110

complexity-reduced sequencing of 378 introgression population lines and 116 Ae. tauschii

111

accessions. The distribution of introgressed segments across the genome was investigated to

112

assess its overall effect on genetic diversity, and evaluate the impact of recombination rate

113

variation and early selection for uniform phenological and developmental characteristics on

114

the introgression frequency in different parts of the wheat genome. The effect of selection

115

against non-adaptive traits contributed by Ae. tauschii was investigated around the

116

domestication gene Tg controlling tenacious glume trait (Sood et al. 2009).

117
118

Materials and methods

119

The study population consisted of 351 BC1F3:5 Ae. tauschii introgression lines

120

developed by crossing synthetic Ae. tauschii-wheat octoploid lines with hexaploid wheat

121

recurrent parents. The octoploid lines were developed by crossing six hexaploid wheat

122

parents with 21 Ae. tauschii accessions (Supporting Information Table S1). The resulting F1

123

hybrid plants regenerated from rescued embryos were treated with colchicine to generate the

124

synthetic octoploids (Dale et al. 2017). The synthetic octoploids were then backcrossed once

125

to the respective hexaploid wheat parents or to another wheat line. The BC1F1 plants were

126

selfed and advanced by single seed descent to the BC1F3 generation. Seeds from individual

127

BC1F3 plants were bulked and grown in single rows in the field at the Kansas State University

128

Ashland Research Farm near Manhattan, KS in the 2016-17 growing season. Thirty-one

129

families were represented in this material. The number of lines per family ranged from 42 to

130

137 and resulted in a total of 2,861 lines that were planted. The 351 lines used in this research

131

were selected from this set of materials. Selection criteria included production of sufficient

132

seed to allow yield testing, general fitness, threshability to allow mechanical harvest and

133

phenology similar to the elite hexaploid parent(s). In addition, 116 diverse Ae. tauschii

134

accessions representing Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii and Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata from

Sequencing complexity-reduced genomic libraries

140

DNA from Ae. tauschii introgression population and the reference panel samples was

141

extracted using DNeasy 96 Plant DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) following the manufacture’s

142

protocol. The quality and concentration of the DNA was assessed using PicoGreen® dsDNA

143

assay kit (Life Technologies). Input DNA was normalized to 400 ng (20ul of 20ng/ul) using

144

Qiagility robot (Qiagen). Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) libraries were constructed using

145

the modified protocol previously described by Saintenac et al. (2013), and subjected to size

146

selection using Pippin Prep system (Sage Scientific) to enrich for 270-330 bp fragments. In

147

total, five libraries were produced, representing 80 barcoded accessions each. Each library

148

was sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 using a 1 x 75 bp kit for the introgression lines and

149

1 x 100 bp kit for the reference panel following the Illumina protocol. TASSEL 5.0 GBS v2

150

pipeline (Glaubitz et al. 2014) was used to generate SNPs from the fastq files of the

151

introgression lines and the reference panel. In brief, the raw GBS sequence reads were

152

aligned to the Chinese Spring reference sequence v1.0 (The International Wheat Genome

153

Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) 2018) using Burrow’s Wheeler Alignment (BWA)

154

software. TASSEL 5.0 GBS v2 default parameters were used in all steps (Glaubitz et al.

155

2014).

157

SNP genotyping and imputation

158

SNPs for the reference Ae. tauschii panel with minor allele frequency (MAF) less than

159

0.02 and maximum missingness greater than 70 % were filtered out using vcf-filter tools. The

160

missing SNPs were imputed using the program Beagle v.5.0 (Browning and Browning 2013)

161

with default parameters (File S1). SNPs from Ae. tauschii derived introgression population

162

were filtered in two steps. First, SNPs from all subgenomes (A, B and D) with minor allele

163

frequency (MAF) less than 0.05 and maximum missingness greater than 30 % were filtered

164

out using vcf-filter tools. The missing SNP were imputed using the program Beagle v.5.0

165

with default parameters. In the next step, all A and B genome SNPs, and D genome SNPs

166

with MAF less than 0.01 were excluded from the raw vcf file using vcf-filter tools. The

167

program conform-gt (https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/conform-gt.html) was used to

168

check the concordance of D genome SNP positions between the introgression population and

Missing and ungenotyped SNPs in the D genome of the introgression population were

Principal component analysis (PCA)

175

The population structure of the diverse Ae. tauschii accessions and the introgression

176

population was analyzed using the 11,624 D genome SNPs segregating in both populations

177

(File S3, S4). SNP dataset was converted to the hapmap format and imported into TASSEL

178

v.5.0, which was used to calculate the principal components. The first two components were

179

plotted to show the distribution and clustering of the reference panel accessions in relation to

180

the 21 parental Ae. tauschii accessions and the entire introgression population. In addition, a

181

total of 13,719 SNPs (File S5), including 4,016, 4,142, 5,112 and 449 from A, B, D genomes

182

and unanchored scaffolds, respectively, were used to evaluate the distribution of Ae. tauschii-

183

derived introgression lines on the first two principal components using wheat parents as

184

grouping factors.

186

Genetic diversity

187

To evaluate the effect of introgression on genetic diversity, the mean number of base

188

differences for each SNP site in all pairwise comparisons () among Ae. tauschii accessions,

189

introgression lines and hexaploid wheat lines were calculated using vcftools and summarized

190

in R (R Development Core Team 2011). The  values for each chromosome were interpolated

191

using the R function ‘approx’ (method=’linear’, rule=1) and plotted using R package

192

‘ggplot2’.

193
194

Recombination hotspots

195

The imputed D-genome SNPs were split into subsets based on families. A

196

combination of custom Perl and R scripts (Nyine et al. 2018), were used to convert the SNP

197

alleles to 0, 1, and 2, of which, 0 is homozygous major allele, 1 is heterozygous and 2 is

198

homozygous minor allele. Regions containing monomorphic SNPs were eliminated by the R

199

script. A total of 16 families each having at least 10 progenies plus the respective parents

200

were used in this analysis. A separate custom Perl script was used to count the number of

201

allele phase transitions in each chromosome per individual and recode the flanking SNP

202

positions as break points (Jordan et al. 2018). The number of recombination breakpoints

203

(RBP) per 10 kb sliding window in each chromosome per family was obtained using bedmap

204

option from BEDOPS v2.4.35 (Neph et al. 2012). The total RBP per 10 kb window across the

205

16 families was obtained and the 99th percentile plotted using R-package ggplot2. All

206

windows with total RBP below the 99th percentile of recombination events were masked by

207

adding 0 before the line plots were generated. The centromere position in each chromosome

208

was marked based on the Chinese Spring reference genome (The International Wheat

209

Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) 2018; Su et al. 2019). Kruskal Wallis test was

210

used to test for significant differences in the distribution of recombination breakpoints in each

211

family.

212

In order to investigate the effect of sequence divergence and structural re-

213

arrangements on recombination, we compared hexaploid wheat (Chinese Spring) and the

214

diploid relative, Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata (AL8/79) D genomes at protein level. High

215

confidence D genome gene protein sequences from Chinese Spring v.1.0 and Ae. tauschii

216

v.4.0 (Luo et al. 2017) were used. The annotation of the Ae. tauschii genome was

217

downloaded from http://aegilops.wheat.ucdavis.edu/ATGSP/annotation/. Local protein

218

BLAST databases were created for each dataset using BLAST2+. Reciprocal blastp was

219

performed between the two species’ genome proteins using default parameters. A Perl script

220

was used to filter out blast hits with percent identity less than 95 and gap opens greater than

221

0. A file consisting of species chromosome identity, gene name, gene start and end positions

222

was generated from the respective gff3 file. MCScanX software (Wang et al. 2012) was used

223

to generate the dot plot and dual synteny plot that were used to compare the structural

224

differences between the genome of T. aesitvum and Ae. tauschii.

225

The difference in recombination rate between Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata and Ae.

226

tauschii ssp. tauschii introgression lines was ascertained by the pairwise comparison of

227

families derived from each subspecies using equal number of SNPs from the same genomic

228

loci. The correlation between total RBP and genetic distance was calculated between the

229

introgression lines and their respective hexaploid wheat and Ae. tauschii parents. Scatter plots

230

for genetic distance versus total RBP were generated for each family using ggplot2.

231
232

Identity by Descent detection (IBD)

233

Introgression of Ae. tauschii genome in hexaploid wheat was inferred using IBD.

234

SNPs from each chromosome were separated and used as input genotype (gt) data for IBD

235

detection. The program Beagle v.4.1 was used to detect IBD segments between introgression

236

lines, hexaploid wheat and Ae. tauschii parents using default parameters. The R-package

237

ggplot2 was used to generate a density plot of IBD segment start per chromosome to show

238

the distribution pattern. All chromosomes were scaled by dividing the IBD values by the

239

individual chromosome length and then multiplied by 100. Using a sliding window of 0.5 Mb

240

and a 1 % fraction of overlap between features, IBD segments shared between introgression

241

lines and Ae. tauschii parents were counted in each window using the bedmap tool provided

242

in BEDOPS v2.4.35 and a line graph was plotted using ggplot2.

243

The efficiency of introgression was estimated as a percentage of observed proportion

244

of Ae. tauschii genome in the introgression lines as inferred by IBD to the expected

245

proportion of Ae. tauschii in BC1F3:5. Assuming that recombination events between Ae.

246

tauschii and hexaploid wheat D genomes occurred normally in each chromosome, the

247

expected proportion of Ae. tauschii genome in the BC1F3:5 introgression lines was

248

approximated at 25 %. The observed proportion of introgression was obtained by dividing the

249

total length of IBD segments from Ae. tauschii shared with each line by the genome size of

250

Ae. tauschii (4.3 Gb) and multiplied by 100. The result was then divided by 25 and multiplied

251

by 100 to get the percentage introgression efficiency. The average, standard deviation,

252

minimum and maximum IBD length shared between introgression lines, introgression lines

253

and hexaploid wheat, introgression lines and Ae. tauschii parents were determined, and

254

divided by the chromosome size.

255

The relationship between IBD and the domestication gene tenacious glume (Tg) on

256

chromosome arm 2DS was explored. The IBD count per 1 kb sliding window was used to

257

compare the frequency of introgression in the Tg region. Genes within the Tg region (21.8

258

Mb to 23.3 Mb) and their functional annotation were extracted from the Chinese Spring

259

reference gene annotation file. Introgression lines were phenotyped for tenacious glume trait.

260

The results were used to confirm the presence or absence of wild type alleles depending on

261

whether the introgression segment spanned the Tg gene region or not. Genome-wide

262

association analysis of tenacious glume trait with the 11,624 SNP markers was done using

263

GAPIT function in R. A mixed linear model was used and the population structure was

264

controlled using the first three principal components calculated from the markers. A

265

Manhattan plot of negative log10 of false discovery rate (FDR) transformed P-values from the

266

D chromosomes was generated in R using ‘qqman’ package.

Genotyping and SNP imputation

273

A total of 314,783,044 high quality NGS reads with barcodes were generated with an

274

average of 2,713,647 reads per sample from the diverse Ae. tauschii accessions (Supporting

275

Information Table S2). Eighty-six percent (86 %) of the reads were aligned to the Chinese

276

Spring reference sequence v.1.0 (The International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium

277

(IWGSC) 2018) with an average of 2,336,299 reads per sample. The number of SNP sites

278

generated from the TASSEL v. 5.0 GBS v.2 pipeline was 120,877. After filtering out SNPs

279

with MAF less than 0.02, and maximum missingness greater than 70%, the number of

280

retained SNPs was 86,031.

281

Similarly, 1,080,452,138 high quality reads with barcodes were generated with an

282

average of 2,904,441 reads per sample from the introgression population (Supporting

SNPs generated by the TASSEL v.5.0 GBS v.2 pipeline was 275,286. A total of 58,932 SNPs

286

from the A, B, and D genomes were retained after filtering out SNPs with MAF less than 0.05

287

and maximum missingness greater than 30%. The number of SNPs from the D genome was

288

37.6 % of the filtered SNP dataset. The second filtering performed on the D genome SNPs to

289

remove sites with MAF less than 0.01 resulted in 41,228 SNPs, out of which, 7,749 also

290

segregated in the diverse set of Ae. tauschii accessions (henceforth, reference panel). Using

291

the program Beagle v.5.0 (Browning and Browning 2013), 78,282 SNPs were imputed from

292

the reference panel into the Ae. tauschii-derived introgression population.

Principle component analysis

295

Population structure of Ae. tauschii and introgression populations based on genetic

296

markers reflects the allele diversity in the species. The 137 Ae. tauschii accessions formed

297

three distinct clusters when the first two PCs calculated from 11,624 SNPs were plotted (Fig.

298

1). One cluster consisting of accessions known to belong to Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata or

299

lineage 2 (L2), was clearly distinct from the rest (Wang et al. 2013). The remaining two

300

clusters belonged to Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii or lineage 1 (L1a and L1b). Cluster L1a was

301

the most heterogeneous with accessions coming from Afghanistan (AFG), Turkmenistan

302

(TKM), Iran (IRN), Pakistan (PAK) and Tajikistan (TJK), (Table S3). Fifteen of the Ae.

303

tauschii parents used to generate the introgression population belonged to this cluster. More

304

than two thirds of the accessions in cluster L1b were from Turkey (TUR) with only a few

305

admixtures from Armenia (ARM), IRN, TJK and PAK. Three parents of the introgression

306

population were present in this cluster. Cluster L2 consisted of Ae. tauschii accessions mostly

307

collected from Iran (IRN), although a few accessions from Azerbaijan (AZE), Turkmenistan

308

(TKM) and TUR were present. Three parents of the introgression population parents

309

clustered in this group and two of them (TA1642, TA2378) are known to belong to Ae.

310

tauschii ssp. strangulata or lineage 2 (Wang et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2019).

311

The broad geographic distribution of Ae. tauschii accessions used to generate the

312

introgression population increases the chances of transferring alleles adaptive to different

313

agroecological zones. When the introgression lines were plotted on the first two PCs together

314

with Ae. tauschii accessions and hexaploid wheat parents, cluster L1a and L1b collapsed into

315

one cluster (Fig. 2). Cluster L2 remained independent while the introgression lines and

316

hexaploid wheat parents formed another cluster. The introgression lines showed a wide

317

distribution on the two PCs relative to the Ae. tauschii and hexaploid wheat parents. Many

318

introgression lines clustered closer to hexaploid wheat parents indicating that the greater

319

proportion of genome in the BC1F3:5 lines comes from hexaploid wheat. This trend is likely

320

associated with the loss of the introgressed segments as a result of backcrossing to the

321

hexaploid parents and selection during population development. When the introgression lines

322

were compared with the hexaploid wheat parents using 13,719 SNPs from all three sub-

323

genomes, clustering was consistent with the pedigree (Fig. 3). In each cluster, admixed

324

introgression lines were observed because of the shared Ae. tauschii parents.

325
326

Genetic diversity

327

While most domesticated species experienced loss of genetic diversity due to

328

population bottleneck and selection for alleles controlling domestication traits, their

329

respective wild ancestors often maintain high levels of genetic diversity (Akhunov et al.

330

2010; Xu et al. 2012; Hufford et al. 2012). To assess the effect of wild relative introgression

331

on genetic diversity in wheat, we estimated SNP diversity (π) in the populations of Ae.

332

tauschii, hexaploid wheat parents and the introgression lines. The average  value for the

333

diverse Ae. tauschii accessions was 0.33, suggesting that these accessions represented a rich

334

allelic diversity that could be valuable for wheat improvement. A cross-population diversity

335

comparison showed a low average genetic diversity in the wheat D genome across all

336

chromosomes (Table 1). The lowest diversity was found in the hexaploid wheat parents with

337

the chromosome mean ranging from 0.004 to 0.014 as compared to Ae. tauschii parents that

338

ranged from 0.108 to 0.114. For most chromosome regions, the levels of genetic diversity in

339

the introgression population were intermediate between the levels of diversity in the parental

340

populations of wheat and Ae. tauschii but tended towards the Ae. tauschii with maximum

341

mean  of 0.12 on chromosome 4D (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2). Analysis of variance showed

342

significant differences in  values between Ae. tauschii, hexaploid wheat and introgression

343

lines (P < 0.001), but not between chromosomes (P = 1). The genetic diversity of the

344

introgression lines for most regions of chromosome 4D and 5D were higher than those of Ae.

345

tauschii parents (Fig. S2). Taken together, these results indicate that Ae. tauschii introgression

346

lines substantially increased the genetic diversity of the recurrent hexaploid wheat parents.

347
348

Effect of recombination rate on introgression

349

One of the factors affecting the distribution of recombination events across genome

350

are structural re-arrangements (Stapley et al. 2017). Using the comparative dot-plot analysis

351

of gene order along the chromosomes, we observed that more than 99% of the genes from T.

352

aestivum were perfectly collinear to those of Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata suggesting lack of

353

major structural re-arrangements between the D genomes of bread wheat and its diploid

354

ancestor (Fig. 5A). However, some small-scale inversions were observed on chromosomes

355

2D, 4D and 6D in the regions near the centromeres, and four genes were found in non-

356

syntenic positions between the wheat (1D and 5D) and Ae. tauschii (1D, 4D and 5D)

357

chromosomes (Fig. 5B).

358

Efficiency of introgression could also be strongly influenced by the distribution of

359

recombination rate along the chromosomes. Consistent with previous observations (Jordan et

360

al. 2018), a high frequency of recombination events was observed towards the telomeres but

361

the patterns were chromosome specific. Kruskal Wallis test showed that across all families,

362

the number of recombination breakpoints (RBP) was significantly different between

363

chromosomes (P < 0.001) at 95 % confidence level. At 99th percentile, chromosome 2D, 5D

364

and 7D had the highest number of regions with elevated recombination rate, while 1D and 5D

365

had the highest total RBP per 10 kb window (Table 2, Table S4). Most chromosomes showed

366

no evidence of recombination in the regions near the centromere, except for chromosomes 1D

367

and 6D (Fig. 6).

368

The frequency of recombination points between two different species are determined

369

by the genetic distance or sequence diversity between them. It is expected that, as the genetic

370

distance between hexaploid wheat and the Ae. tauschii accessions increases, the total RBP

371

should reduce within the introgression lines resulting from such a cross. All families showed

372

negative Pearson’s correlation coefficients for total RBP and genetic distance between

373

introgression lines and Ae. tauschii parents (Fig. 7). As expected, introgression lines with

374

many introgression segments from Ae. tauschii had many total RBP and were genetically

375

closer to Ae. tauschii than wheat. A reduction in the total RBP was observed in families

376

FAM92, FAM93 and FAM96 derived from wheat and Ae. tauschii parents TA1642 and

377

TA2378, which belong to Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata. This observation was contrary to

378

what was expected. Further analysis comparing FAM93 derived from Ae. tauschii ssp.

379

strangulata to seven Ae. tauschii ssp. tauchsii-derived families (FAM97, FAM98, FAM99,

380

FAM106, FAM109, FAM112 and FAM116) and FAM92 derived from Ae. tauschii ssp.

381

strangulata using same and equal number of SNPs that were segregating between the

382

parental lines also showed the same trend (Fig S3). The t-test statistics did not reveal

383

significant difference in recombination rate between FAM93 and FAM92 (P = 0.469) at 95 %

384

confidence level. However, significant differences were observed between Ae. tauschii ssp.

385

strangulata-derived family FAM93 and all Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii-derived families (P <

386

0.001). These observations can be explained by the low level of SNP diversity between the

387

wheat D genome and Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata, which is considered to be the donor of the

388

wheat D genome (Dvorak et al. 1998), resulting in underestimation of the total number of

389

crossovers in the FAM92, FAM93 and FAM96 families. It is also possible that increase in the

390

levels of interhomolog polymorphism can stimulate recombination. In Arabidopsis, increase

391

in crossovers was observed when heterozygous regions are juxtaposed with homozygous

392

regions (Ziolkowski et al. 2015), suggesting that the genomic distribution of interhomolog

393

divergence have substantial effect on distribution of recombination rate.

395

Identity by descent analysis shows low introgression frequency in the pericentromeric

regions

397

The proportion of wild relative genome in the elite wheat lines can influence many

398

traits but the location of introgressions is key in determining the effects. In this study, IBD

399

was used to infer introgression of Ae. tauschii genome into hexaploid wheat lines. A density

400

plot of IBD segments along the chromosomes of the introgression population showed a U-

401

shaped distribution (Fig. 8). The frequency of IBD segments positively correlated with the

402

distribution of recombination rate (Jordan et al. 2018) and increased from the centromeres

403

towards the telomeric regions of the chromosomes. There was no chromosome preference

404

during introgression. Variation in the number of introgressions per line were observed across

405

chromosomes with the percentage proportion of Ae. tauschii genome in the introgression

406

lines ranging from 0.075 % to 13.5 % (Table S5). The efficiency of introgression as inferred

407

by IBD ranged from 0.3 % to 54.1 % based on the expected 25 % Ae. tauschii genome in the

408

BC1F3:5 lines. Some lines had single or multiple introgression per chromosome. The IBD

409

segments shared between the introgression lines and wheat parents were on average 2.4 folds

410

longer than those shared with the Ae. tauschii parents (Table 3), but not significantly different

411

at 95% confidence level based on the t-test statistics (P = 0.066). The average percent length

412

of IBD segments shared between introgression lines and Ae. tauschii parents varied from

413

2.69 % to 6.98 % with a minimum of 0.28 % and a maximum of 41.33 %. Similarly, the

414

average percent length of IBD segments shared between the chromosomes of introgression

415

lines and hexaploid wheat parents ranged between 6.16 % and 26.63 % with a minimum of

416

0.44 % and a maximum of 86.18 %. The IBD segments shared between introgression lines

417

reached up to 100 % on chromosomes 3D, 4D and 6D.

418
419

Relationship between IBD segments and tenacious glume gene

420

Free-threshing is one of the traits that led to the domestication of wheat and it is

421

controlled by Q and Tg genes (Jantasuriyarat et al. 2004; Simons et al. 2006). In-depth

422

analysis of chromosome 2D was carried out to understand the relationship between IBD

423

segments and domestication gene Tg (Sood et al. 2009). The analysis was based on the

424

hypothesis that introgression lines that were free-threshing had shared IBD segments with

425

wheat on 2DS where Tg gene is expected and no shared IBD segments with Ae. tauschii. To

426

test this hypothesis, the sequences of microsatellite markers Xgwm455, Xgwm296, Xgwm261

427

and Xwmc503 linked to Tg were aligned to the Chinese Spring reference v.1.0 to determine

428

their location on 2DS. Marker Xwmc503 closest to Tg gene mapped at 19.6 Mb on 2DS

429

(Table S6). Based on Sood et al. (2009) genetic map, the Tg gene is located 2.2 cM away

430

from marker Xwmc503, implying that the Tg gene is located approximately at position 21.8

431

Mb. A count of IBD segments within 1-kb sliding windows showed a sharp decline in IBD

432

segments shared between introgression lines and Ae. tauschii parents within the Tg gene

433

region (Fig. 9A). The IBD segments shared between the introgression lines and hexaploid

434

wheat parents increased in the Tg gene region indicating a selection pressure for free-

435

threshing trait during population development. The lowest decline in IBD segments count

436

was observed at 23.3 Mb. There were 40 high confidence genes within the 21.8 Mb to 23.3

437

Mb interval (Table S7) including two transcription factors from the bZIP and GRAS families.

438

To verify the impact of introgression on free-threshing, we phenotyped the

439

introgression lines for tenacious glume trait and compared the results with IBD map. All lines

440

that had introgression segments spanning the Tg gene region on 2DS were positive for

441

tenacious glume trait (Table S8). Some lines, which had the introgression segment boundary

442

close to the Tg region also scored positive for tenacious glume trait (false negative), but a

443

majority were negative as expected. The presence of some false negatives could be explained

444

by the inability of the Beagle program to accurately determine the exact boundary of the

445

introgression in some cases.

446

Genome-wide association studies are used to determine the non-random association of

447

marker alleles to the trait of interest. Using a mixed linear model while controlling for the

448

population structure, we observed that majority of the significant SNPs associated with

449

tenacious glume trait in the introgression population were located on chromosome arm 2DS

450

(Fig. 9B), which was consistent with IBD analysis. At a threshold FDR q-value of 0.05, 31

451

SNPs near the Tg locus on 2DS showed significant association with the trait and the closest

452

SNPs to the Tg locus were chr2D_19242994 and chr2D_22955732 located downstream and

453

upstream of the locus, respectively (Table S9).

455

Discussion

456

Wheat improvement through breeding is a continuous process that delivers new

457

varieties to the farmers to ensure sustainable food production under changing environmental

458

conditions and increasing world population. For several decades, breeding efforts have been

459

directed towards improving agronomic, yield and disease resistance traits but of late climate

460

change is becoming one of the major crop production constraints. Wild relatives adapted to

461

various agroecological climates are the sources of alleles that can protect wheat by making it

462

resilient to climate change. In this study, we tracked the introgression of diverse Ae. tauschii

463

subspecies genome segments in hexaploid wheat and assessed its impact on genetic diversity.

464

Loss of genetic diversity associated with domestication and breeding (Haudry et al.

465

2007; Akhunov et al. 2010; Ozkan et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2012; Hufford et al. 2012) can

466

potentially reduce the adaptive potential of cultivated wheat. Wild relatives of wheat were

467

shown to be valuable source of allelic diversity for improving disease resistance, drought

468

tolerance and quality traits (Uauy et al. 2006; Sohail et al. 2011; Saintenac et al. 2013;

469

Periyannan et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2015). The wild diploid ancestor of the wheat D genome,

470

Ae. tauschii, was shown to have two main lineages that experienced limited contact (Wang et

471

al. 2013). The level of D genome genetic diversity in the wheat lines derived from crosses

472

with Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata from lineage 2 was shown to be lower than in the lines

473

derived from Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii from lineage 1, consistent with the origin of the wheat

474

D genome from Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata (Dvorak et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013).

475

Therefore, the introgression lines developed in our study carry genomic segments from Ae.

476

tauschii accessions coming from geographically diverse locations that represent different

477

climatic conditions and biotic pressure under which wheat grows. These lines present a

478

valuable genetic resource for breeding climate resilient, disease resistant and nutritionally

479

high-quality wheat.

480

Introgression from wild relatives into wheat is challenged by hybrid incompatibility,

481

embryo abortion and infertility (Gill and Raupp 1987), and was successfully accomplished

482

from the direct ancestors of the wheat D and AB genomes using synthetic hexaploids or

483

octoploids (Miranda et al. 2006; Dreisigacker et al. 2008; Dale et al. 2017). High density

484

genotyping data generated by sequencing now permits high-resolution haplotype analysis of

485

diverse populations and accurate imputation of missing data using reference panels (Jordan et

486

al. 2015; Nyine et al. 2019). In this study, imputation with the reference panel of Ae. tauschii

487

accessions was used to increase the number of SNPs on the D genome of the introgression

488

lines. This resource enabled identification of introgression segments from a wild relative by

489

inferring IBD regions. A similar approach was used in maize to identify 23 regions showing

490

IBD with the foundation parents using MaizeSNP50 BeadChip (Liu et al. 2015).

491

The lack of major structural rearrangements differentiating the wheat D genome from

492

its diploid ancestor underlies successful gene and trait transfer from Ae. tauschii into bread

493

wheat. The high level of structural similarity between these two genomes facilitated the

494

hybridization and recombination between them (Gill and Raupp 1987; Dvorak et al. 1998;

495

Akhunov et al. 2010; Luo et al. 2017), with our results being consistent with the previously

496

made observations. Relatively small inversions near the centromeric regions of chromosomes

497

2D, 4D and 6D had little impact on introgression efficiency compared to other centromeric

498

regions without inversions. The low frequency of crossovers in these regions does not allow

499

for estimating the effect of structural rearrangements on recombination and introgression.

500

The frequency of IBD regions along the chromosomes showed a U-shaped

501

distribution with lower incidence of regions derived from Ae. tauschii in the pericentromeric

502

regions. The introgression frequency correlated negatively with the length of IBD regions and

503

positively with the frequency of crossovers indicating that longer introgressed segments in

504

the low-recombining pericentromeric regions had lower chance of being inherited in the

505

progeny of crosses between Ae. tauschii-derived octoploids and wheat. These chromosomal

506

patterns of introgression efficiency and length suggest that introgression was strongly

507

affected by the distribution of recombination rate along chromosomes. This outcome was not

508

expected as we assumed that selected lines in the BC1F3:4 generation plants should have equal

509

probability of inheriting introgressed regions across entire genome. However, it is likely that

510

selection applied at BC1F3:4 generation to maintain uniform phenology, threshability,

511

flowering time and developmental characteristics inadvertently eliminated many lines

512

carrying large introgressed regions in the pericentromeric regions. According to theory,

513

introgressions that carry alleles having a negative impact on the selected traits will be

514

removed from the population, with the size of the affected region defined by the

515

recombination rate (Hill and Robertson 1966). It appears that negative interaction between

516

alleles located within large introgressions in the low-recombining pericentromeric region and

517

alleles of the adapted recurrent parent affected targeted phenotypes resulting in removal of

518

these plants during population development. The limited number of recombination events at

519

the BC1F2 generation, especially in the large pericentromeric regions of wheat chromosomes,

520

resulted in linkage drag that affected substantial proportion of the genome.

521

On the contrary, terminal regions of wheat chromosomes showed the high rate of

522

introgression consistent with the theoretical predictions of the effect of selection on linked

523

variation (Hill and Robertson 1966). The importance of recombination in separating the

524

negatively selected alleles from the background was clearly demonstrated for the Tg locus

525

controlling free-threshing trait in wheat (Jantasuriyarat et al. 2004; Sood et al. 2009). Since

526

this gene is located in the high-recombining terminal region of chromosome, we did not

527

observe substantial effect of selection against the wild-type allele on the frequency of

528

introgression from Ae. tauschii. The high recombination rate even allowed for mapping the

529

Tg gene locus to the 1.5 Mb genomic interval, which was confirmed by genome-wide

530

association analysis. Taken together, these results indicate that the unintended consequence of

531

selection applied during the early stages of introgression population development is the low

532

rate of introgression in the low-recombining regions of the wheat genome.

533

With the development of new genomic resources for wheat and its wild relatives (Ling

534

et al. 2013; Avni et al. 2017; Luo et al. 2017; The International Wheat Genome Sequencing

535

Consortium (IWGSC) 2018; Arora et al. 2019), the importance of introgression populations

536

for wheat improvement is increasing. Recombination will be one of the main factors that will

537

influence the efficiency of introgression in these populations. Our study suggests that any

538

form of selection applied during population development quickly eliminates large portions of

539

the donor genome, especially in regions of low recombination. The loss of the wild relative’s

540

alleles in the pericentromeric regions in this study was somewhat surprising given that

541

phenotypic selection was only applied at the BC1F3:4 stage and field conditions for selection

542

were poor. This clearly suggests that multiple genes with strong combined effect on adaptive

543

traits are present in these regions and identification of any beneficial alleles in these regions

544

will be complicated by linkage drag.

545

It is common practice for germplasm development programs to subject material to

546

selection pressure from early stages of population development. This is consistent with the

547

goal of identifying high performing materials relatively quickly to support commercial

548

breeding. The application of early selection allows rapid exploitation of beneficial alleles in

549

the regions of high recombination. This is a worthy objective but the current results are a

550

clear justification for a two-tiered approach to germplasm development if such programs are

551

to fully exploit the diversity present in donor material.

552

Exploration and exploitation of diversity in regions of lower recombination requires a

553

parallel approach to germplasm development that complements the efforts to rapidly exploit

554

diversity present in the highly recombining regions. The first step is to ensure that maximum

555

diversity is maintained in the introgression materials. This could be achieved by genotyping

556

early generation populations to select subsets of lines carrying introgressions covering the

557

genome. Low selection pressure and marker-assisted population management will retain

558

introgressed regions. The drive toward fixation that occurs with additional selfing generations

559

calls for methods to maintain heterozygosity, such as random mating through the use of

560

genetic male sterility or chemical hybridizing agents, that are warranted in self-pollinated

561

species. This would enhance effective recombination and increase the probability of freeing

562

beneficial alleles from the influence of linked deleterious alleles in regions of low

563

recombination. Failure to engage such strategies will result in the near-immediate loss of

564

introgressed diversity, reducing the potential long-term impact of germplasm development

565

programs. Recently, genetic factors controlling crossover frequency across genome and in the

566

pericentromeric regions of wheat chromosomes have been identified (Jordan et al. 2018;

567

Gardiner et al. 2019). The discovery of these genetic factors could also facilitate strategies to

568

further increase the efficiency of introgression, and selection for favorable introgressed

569

alleles in the low recombining regions.
