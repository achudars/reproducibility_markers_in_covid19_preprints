Abstract

8

DRB1 (HYL1) is a double-stranded RNA binding protein involved in miRNA processing in plants.

9

It is a core component of the Microprocessor complex and enhances the efficiency and

10

precision of miRNA processing by DCL1 protein. In this work, we report a novel function of

11

DRB1 protein in the transcription of MIR genes. DRB1 co-localizes with RNA Polymerase II and

12

affects its distribution along MIR genes. Moreover, proteomic experiments revealed that

13

DRB1 protein interacts with many transcription factors. Finally, we show that the action of

14

DRB1 is not limited to MIR genes as it impacts expression of many other genes, majority of

15

which are involved in plant response to light. These discoveries add DRB1 as another player

16

of gene regulation at transcriptional level, independent of its role in miRNA biogenesis.

Introduction

20

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ~21nt RNA molecules that play vital role in post-transcriptional

21

regulation of gene expression (Bartel 2004). miRNAs are involved in a vast range of metabolic

22

processes and hence act as regulatory molecules in overall plant development, for example in

23

processes like determination of leaf shape, flowering time and response to environmental

24

conditions (Palatnik, Allen et al. 2003, Chen 2004, Kruszka, Pieczynski et al. 2012,

25

Barciszewska-Pacak, Milanowska et al. 2015). miRNA genes (MIR) are transcribed by RNA Pol

26

II (Xie, Allen et al. 2005) and the primary transcripts (known as primary-miRNAs; pri-miRNAs)

27

contain a stem-loop region. The pri-miRNAs are then cleaved to release mature miRNAs by

28

a complex of enzymes known as the Microprocessor. Notably, the stem-loop region of pri-

29

miRNAs serves as a mark for the Microprocessor to recognize and start processing the pri-

30

miRNAs (Kurihara and Watanabe 2004, Dolata, Taube et al. 2018). Microprocessor is

31

a complex of three core proteins, Dicer Like 1 (DCL1), Double-stranded RNA Binding protein 1

32

(DRB1) (also known as Hyponastic Leaves 1 (HYL1)) and Serrate (SE) (Yang, Liu et al. 2006,

33

Fang and Spector 2007, Dong, Han et al. 2008, Dolata, Taube et al. 2018). DCL1 is a RNAse III

34

type enzyme that cuts and releases miRNA/miRNA* from pri-miRNAs in a two-step reaction

35

(Park, Li et al. 2002, Reinhart, Weinstein et al. 2002). DRB1 and SE assist and increase the

36

accuracy of pri-miRNA cleavage by DCL1 (Kurihara, Takashi et al. 2006). All three of these core

37

components are necessary for proper functioning of Microprocessor and in mutants of any of

38

these proteins, pri-miRNAs accumulate and mature miRNAs are downregulated (Laubinger,

39

Sachsenberg et al. 2008, Szarzynska, Sobkowiak et al. 2009, Zielezinski, Dolata et al. 2015).

40

Two modes of Microprocessor mediated pri-miRNA cleavage have been described: base to

41

loop (first cut at the base, second closer to the loop structure) and loop to base (first cut in

42

the loop and second closer to the base), depending on the directionality of DCL1 cleavage

43

(Kurihara and Watanabe 2004, Bologna, Mateos et al. 2009).

44

DRB1, a double stranded RNA binding protein, contains two double stranded RNA binding

45

domains (dsRBDs) in its N-terminal region followed by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and

46

an unstructured C-terminal region (Yang, Chen et al. 2010). DRB1 is considered to form

47

a homodimer and bind the miRNA/miRNA* duplex region of pri-miRNA (Burdisso, Milia et al.

48

2014, Yang, Ren et al. 2014). DRB1 knockout has a pleiotropic impact on the phenotype of

49

plants (among the others defects in leaf shape and late flowering time) and their response to

50

auxin and ABA (Lu and Fedoroff 2000, Vazquez, Gasciolli et al. 2004). So far, no ortholog of

51

DRB1 has been identified in mammalian cells. However, similar to plants, mammalian RNA

52

nucleases (Drosha and Dicer) also require proteins containing dsRBDs: DiGeorge syndrome

53

critical region 8 (DGCR8) and transactivation response element RNA-binding protein (TRPB),

54

for proper functioning (Han, Lee et al. 2004, Chendrimada, Gregory et al. 2005, Haase,

55

Jaskiewicz et al. 2005). Both, DRB1 and DGCR8 are nuclear proteins involved in first step of

56

pri-miRNA maturation i.e. cleavage by RNAse III (Gregory, Yan et al. 2004). However, like TRBP,

57

DRB1 can be phosphorylated which affects its activity (Paroo, Ye et al. 2009, Manavella,

58

Hagmann et al. 2012, Achkar, Cho et al. 2018).

59

miRNA production in mammalian cells is co-transcriptional as Drosha and DGCR8 have been

60

shown to bind regions in the proximity of many gene promoters (not just MIR genes) and

61

consequently Drosha knockdown in HeLa cells negatively impacts gene transcription (Gromak,

62

Dienstbier et al. 2013). Similarly, in plants, co-transcriptional processing of plant pri-miRNAs

63

has been proposed through the association of DCL1 with the chromatin and Elongator

64

complex (Fang, Cui et al. 2015). However, presence of pri-miRNA transcripts is necessary for

65

the association of DCL1 with chromatin. Since the interaction between DCL1 and DRB1 has

66

been established, here we ask whether it possible that DRB1 is also involved in the

67

transcription of MIR genes?

68

Results

69

DRB1 is a positive regulator of MIR gene transcription.

70

To investigate the possibility that DRB1 protein is involved in the transcription of MIR genes

71

we used a GUS reporter line system. We independently crossed two reporter lines with GUS

72

under two different MIR gene promoters (pMIR393A:GUS and pMIR393B:GUS (Parry,

73

Calderon-Villalobos et al. 2009)) in the wild type (Col-0) background with hyl1-2 mutants

74

(DRB1 knockout mutants). We observed that the expression of GUS protein driven by MIR

75

gene promoter was remarkably lower in hyl1-2 background as compared to Col-0 (Fig. 1A). We

76

measured

77

pMIR392A:GUSxhyl1-2, and

78

observed a significant decrease in the level of GUS transcripts in pMIR392A:GUSxhyl1-2, and

79

pMIR392B:GUSxhyl1-2 plants. Additionally, we also tested the levels of pri-miRNA393A and

80

pri-miRNA393B in the obtained lines and as expected, these pri-miRNAs were upregulated in

81

the hyl1-2 mutant background (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that DRB1 which is involved in

82

pri-miRNA processing may also regulate the transcription of MIR genes. However, it is also

83

possible that the strong downregulation of GUS expression in the hyl1-2 background is caused

84

by a feedback mechanism in which the global downregulation of miRNAs in hyl1-2 results in

85

an upregulation of a yet unidentified transcriptional factor(s) that in turn inhibits MIR393A

86

and MIR393B transcription. To address this question, we decided to restore the miRNA levels

87

in the reporter lines within hyl1-2 background. For this purpose we crossed these lines with a

88

DCL1 mutant: dcl1-13 (Tagami, Motose et al. 2009). dcl1-13 mutant has a point mutation in

89

the DCL1 gene which promotes DCL1 activity in absence of DRB1. The point mutation in DCL1

90

gene results in an amino acid substitution of Glu to Lys in the ATPase/DExH-box RNA helicase

91

domain. Hence, the expression of dcl1-13 allele in the hyl1-2 background restores the level of

92

miRNAs and rescues plants from the developmental abnormalities associated with lower level

93

of miRNAs. We prepared a hyl1-2/dcl1-13 transgenic line carrying genomic sequence of

94

mutated DCL1 gene under its native promoter. We obtained four independent transgenic lines

95

and confirmed previous results showing that the expression of dcl1-13 allele restores the

96

levels of pri-miRNAs and mature miRNAs in hyl1-2 background (Fig. S1). We then crossed our

97

reporter lines with hyl1-2/dcl1-13 transgenic plants. Analysis of GUS staining in the offspring

98

clearly showed that GUS protein is still inefficiently expressed in the hyl1-2/dcl1-13 mutant

99

background (FIG. 1A, right panel). Additionally, we also performed RT-qPCR analysis to

100

measure the GUS transcript level and like in hyl1-2 mutant, in hyl1-2/dcl1-13 mutant plants,

101

GUS transcript was downregulated in comparison to wild type plants (FIG. 1B, right panel).

102

Hence, our data shows that DRB1 is a direct positive regulator of MIR gene transcription.

103

DRB1 colocalizes with RNA polymerase II

104

The observation that DRB1 is required for a proper transcription of MIR393A and MIR393B

105

prompted us to test the stage at which it affects transcription. We tested the co-localization

106

of DRB1 with RNA Pol II at different stages of transcription. We performed immunolocalization

107

in fixed nuclei from wild type plants and observed strong colocalization of DRB1 and total RNA

108

Pol II (Fig. 2). We used antibodies specific for Serine5 (transcription initiation) and Serine2

109

(transcription elongation) of RNA Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) independently to further

110

characterize the nature of these interactions. The results showed that DRB1 is associated with

111

RNA Pol II already at the transcription initiation stage (Ser5) and remains associated with RNA

112

Pol II during the elongation step (Ser2). Since DRB1 is a part of Microprocessor core complex

113

we considered the possibility that DRB1 is brought to RNA Pol II by another member of

114

Microprocessor. Recently it was shown that SE is directly associated with specific regions of

115

Arabidopsis chromatin (Speth, Szabo et al. 2018). Apart from its role in miRNA biogenesis, SE

116

is involved in many processes connected with RNA metabolism like splicing, 3’-end formation,

117

RNA transport and RNA stability (Laubinger, Sachsenberg et al. 2008, Raczynska, Stepien et al.

118

2014). To exclude the possibility of SE mediating DRB1 and RNA Pol II co-localization, we

119

investigated the interaction of DRB1 with RNA Pol II in the se-2 mutant plants. (Fig S2). Similar

120

to our previous experiment, these results were also obtained for total RNA Pol II and for RNA

121

Pol II phosphorylated at Ser5 or Ser2. We did not see any decrease in co-localization of DRB1

122

and RNA Pol II in the absence of SE, thus showing that the association of DRB1 with RNA pol II

123

is not SE dependent. We also addressed the question whether DRB1 is involved throughout

124

the whole process of transcription. For this purpose, we performed immunolocalization

125

studies for DRB1 and RNA Pol II using antibodies against DRB1 and antibodies which recognize

126

RNA Pol II phosphorylated at threonine 4 (Thr4) of its CTD domain (mostly associated with

127

transcription termination or 3’ end processing events) (Hintermair, Heidemann et al. 2012,

128

Nojima, Rebelo et al. 2018). Our co-localization results showed that DRB1 did not co-localize

129

with RNA pol II phosphorylated at Thr4 in either wild-type or se-2 mutant plants. These data

130

show that DRB1 is involved in transcription process from initiation to elongation, but not at

131

the termination stage and DRB1’s role in transcription stimulation is not mediated by other

132

proteins, at least not by SE.

133

DRB1 protein interacts with transcription factors

134

Since we found that DRB1 acts as a positive regulator of MIR gene transcription and co-

135

localizes with RNA Pol II we decided to test whether it also interacts with other known

136

transcription factors. For this experiment, we used a transgenic line containing DRB1 tagged

137

with HA epitope (pDRB1:DRB1:HA) and anti-HA antibodies to co-immunoprecipitate with its

138

potential protein interactors which were later identified by Mass Spectrometry analysis.

139

As a benchmark for our experiment, we searched for previously published data regarding

140

DRB1 interactors and compared with our data. We were able to identify bona fide DRB1

141

partners KETCH1 and CDC5 in our data (Fig 3). (Zhang, Xie et al. 2013, Zhang, Guo et al. 2017).

142

KETCH1 is a karyopherin enabling the transport of DRB1 to nucleus and CDC5 is a MYB-

143

transcription factor. Interestingly CDC5 was showed to be involved in the transcription of MIR

144

genes (Zhang, Xie et al. 2013). Similar to DRB1 mutant plants, in the CDC5 knockout mutant

145

the GUS reporter which was under the control of MIR gene promoter was downregulated.

146

However, cdc5 mutants showed no enrichment in pri-miRNA level, which can be explained

147

that CDC5 is involved in transcription of MIR genes but not in the processing of pri-miRNA like

148

DRB1 (Vazquez, Gasciolli et al. 2004, Zhang, Xie et al. 2013). Interestingly, in our co-IP results

149

we found that DRB1 was associated also with transcription factors from the Topless

150

transcription factor family (Fig 3). However, the interaction between Topless transcription

151

factors and DRB1 requires more detailed investigation.

152

Distribution of RNA polymerase II is affected in hyl1-2 mutant

153

In light of our data showing that DRB1 and RNA Pol II co-localize, we tested whether this co-

154

localization also affects RNA Pol II occupancy on MIR genes. For this purpose, we performed

155

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using antibody against total RNA Pol II followed by

5

156

qPCR in wild-type and hyl1-2 mutants. We compared the occupancy of RNA Pol II on selected

157

MIR genes (~200 bp upstream of transcription initiation start site) in hyl1-2 and wild-type

158

plants (Fig. 3B). We selected the MIR genes which were tested previously in the cdc5 mutant

159

plants (Zhang, Xie et al. 2013). The results showed that RNA Pol II distribution is affected at

160

several MIR genes promoter regions. Our data showed an increased accumulation of RNA Pol

161

II at the region approximately 200 base pair upstream from the transcription initiation site

162

(TSS) for few tested MIR genes in the hyl1-2 mutant when compared to wild type plants. This

163

observation is opposite to what was reported in cdc5 mutant plants. Additionally, we

164

examined the RNA Pol II distribution in detail on MIR393A and MIR393B genes (Fig. 3C). The

165

higher occupancy of RNA polymerase II in these regions may suggest that, in the hyl1-2

166

mutant: 1) transcription of selected MIR genes is more efficient; or 2) transition

167

initiation to transcription elongation is deregulated. Keeping in mind our previous results

168

where transcription of GUS reporter was downregulated in a hyl1-2 mutant when compared

169

to wild-type plants we suggest that the accumulation of RNA Pol II on the promoter region of

170

MIR genes in hyl1-2 is a result of RNA Pol II’s inability to transition from initiation to elongation.

171

Furthermore, we performed ChIP-seq experiments using antibodies against total RNA pol II in

172

wild-type and hyl1-2 mutant plants for a global analysis of RNA pol II distribution along MIR

173

genes. For the global ChIP-seq analysis we selected only MIR genes which are independent

174

transcriptional units with determined TSS (Bielewicz, Dolata et al. 2012, Zielezinski, Dolata et

175

al. 2015). Results clearly show increased RNA Pol II occupancy in the region of TSS as well as

176

in the gene body of MIR genes in hyl1-2 mutant in comparison to wild-type plants (Fig. 3D).

177

ChIP-seq data also confirmed the results obtained for MIR393A gene (Fig. S3A). Our data

178

suggests that DRB1 acts a positive factor for RNA Pol II to transition through initiation to

179

elongation.

180

Knockdown of DRB1 affects gene expression of many genes.

181

We were interested whether DRB1 could also affect transcription of other genes transcribed

182

by RNA Pol II. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed publicly available transcriptomic data

183

obtained from wild-type and hyl1-2 mutant plants. Theoretically, in hyl1-2 mutant, a generally

184

low level of miRNAs should be accompanied by a general upregulation of miRNA targets. On

185

the contrary, we noticed that approximately half (1531 genes) of differentially expressed

186

genes (DEGs) (3036 genes) in hyl1-2 mutants are downregulated as compared to wild-type

from

187

plants (Fig. 4A). We then compared these results with the transcriptomic data obtained from

188

se-3 mutant. Our analysis showed that almost half of the DEGs are common between se-3

189

mutant and hyl1-2 mutant, indicating that the functions of DRB1 and SE proteins overlap (Fig.

190

4B). Interestingly, there is a big group of DEGs which are specifically downregulated in hyl1-2

191

mutant plants (769 genes). In agreement with our ChIP-seq data, RNA Pol II occupancy (on TSS

192

and gene body) was markedly increased in genes (not limited to MIR genes) whose

193

transcription was affected only by DRB1 (Fig. 3E). Gene ontology analysis showed that proteins

194

encoded from these genes localized mostly in chloroplasts (Fig. 4C). Additionally, the biggest

195

group of genes downregulated in hyl1-2 mutant is involved in biological processes of ‘plastid

196

organization’ according to our gene ontology analysis (Fig. S3B). It was known that light is an

197

important factor for DRB1 maintenance in the cell (Cho, Ben Chaabane et al. 2014). In the

198

night DRB1 is degraded by yet unidentified protease which results in downregulation of

199

mature microRNA level. However, our analysis suggests that DRB1 may be involved in plant

200

response to light independent of its role in the miRNA pathway. Our data regarding the role

201

of DRB1 outside of miRNA biogenesis is further supported by a recently published work that

202

uncovered a novel function of DRB1 connected to skotomorphogenesis independent of its role

203

in miRNA biogenesis (Sacnun, Crespo et al. 2019). Taken together, our data point towards

204

a role of DRB1, outside of miRNA biogenesis, where it acts as a general transcriptional factor,

205

though a lot more work needs to be done before we can completely elucidate the mechanism

206

of transcriptional gene regulation by DRB1.

207

Discussion

208

The DRB1 protein plays a major role in the processing of pri-miRNAs. But it was also reported

209

that without DRB1, in case of intron containing MIR genes both forms of pri-miRNA (before

210

and after splicing) accumulate to high levels in Arabidopsis thaliana (Szarzynska, Sobkowiak et

211

al. 2009). Therefore, it seems that DRB1 may have an additional function in microRNA

212

biogenesis. It appears that the recruitment of DRB1 to the miRNA biogenesis machinery takes

213

place at the very early stages of pri-miRNA processing, possibly before splicing occurs. For

214

protein-coding genes, a direct connection between gene transcription and further co- and

215

post-transcriptional processing of nascent pre-mRNAs has been shown (Bauren and

216

Wieslander 1994, Li, Wang et al. 2019). It is known that almost all plant MIR genes are

217

transcribed by RNA Pol II (Xie, Allen et al. 2005). In addition, similar to pre-mRNAs, primary

7

218

transcripts of MIR genes also undergo further processing, including cap structure formation,

219

polyadenylation, splicing and m6A methylation. (Xie, Allen et al. 2005, Bielewicz, Kalak et al.

220

2013, Schwab, Speth et al. 2013, Knop, Stepien et al. 2017, Bhat, Bielewicz et al. 2019).

221

The results presented in this manuscript show that a GUS reporter under the control of a MIR

222

gene promoter is expressed at a lower level when DRB1 is missing (hyl1-2 and hyl1-2/dcl1-13

223

background). Moreover, evaluation of the occupancy of RNA Pol II on MIR genes in hyl1-2

224

showed an accumulation of total RNA Pol II in the region approximately 200 base pair

225

upstream of the transcription initiation site. This phenomenon was observed in the cases of

226

MIR393A, MIR393B, as well as MIR159A, MIR163, MIR166A, MIR170 and MIR775A in the hyl1-

227

2 mutant. While the distribution of RNA Pol II in a variety of complex genomes is correlated

228

with gene expression, the presence of RNA Pol II at a specific locus does not necessarily

229

indicate active expression from this locus. The higher occupancy of the RNA polymerase II at

230

the analyzed MIR promoter regions, together with results from the GUS reporter assays,

231

suggest that transition of transcription from initiation to elongation is impeded in the hyl1-2

232

mutant. This suggestion is supported by the results showing that DRB1 colocalized with total

233

RNA pol II and also specifically and individually with RNA Pol II phosphorylated at Ser5 and

234

Ser2. It is known that the phosphorylation status of the CTD domain of RNA Pol II is very

235

important in transcription (Komarnitsky, Cho et al. 2000) and the interplay between kinases

236

and phosphatases acting on RNA Pol II can modify gene expression. One of the proteins that

237

is able to dephosphorylate the CTD of the RNA Pol II at Ser5 residue is a protein phosphatase

238

called CPL1 (Koiwa, Hausmann et al. 2004). Similarly, it was reported that the phosphorylation

239

status of DRB1 is also important in microRNA biogenesis (Mendoza, Du et al. 2005, Manavella,

240

Hagmann et al. 2012, Raghuram, Sheikh et al. 2015, Su, Li et al. 2017, Yan, Wang et al. 2017,

241

Achkar, Cho et al. 2018). It was shown that the DRB1 protein needs to be dephosphorylated

242

for its optimal activity and this is also maintained by the CPL1 protein. Fully phosphorylated

243

DRB1 exclusively localized in the nucleus, is not active in pri-miRNA processing, however this

244

does not exclude it role in the transcription of MIR genes. More importantly, phosphorylation

245

status of DRB1 could be a factor that distinguishes its role from acting in transcription and

246

processing of pri-miRNAs. An alternative model suggests that the C-terminal region of DRB1

247

which displays tendencies to bind dsDNA may interact with chromatin (Bhagat, Verma et al.

248

2018). Our data presents new possibilities regarding DRB1’s role in the plant cell but to put

Material and methods

251

Plant material and growth conditions

252

Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 plants were used as wild-type plants, insertion

253

mutant SALK_064863 as knockout of DRB1 (hyl1-2) and insertion mutant SAIL_44_G12 as se-

254

2. pMIR393A:GUS and pMIR393B:GUS reporter lines which were used in this study were

255

described previously (Parry, Calderon-Villalobos et al. 2009). hyl1-2/dcl1-13 and

256

pDRB1:DRB1:HA transgenic lines were obtained by floral dip transformation of hyl1-2 (Clough

257

and Bent 1998). Genomic sequences of DCL1 and DRB1 with around 2kb promoter region were

258

cloned into pENTR-D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Next, site directed mutagenesis was

259

performed to introduce DCL1-13 point mutation. Finally, LR reaction was used to subcloned

260

DCL1-13 and DRB1 sequence into pEarlyGate301 plasmid followed by Agrobacterium

261

transformation (Earley, Haag et al. 2006).

262

Arabidopsis plants were grown in soil (Jiffy-7 42 mm; Jiffy Products International AS, Stange,

263

Norway) or on ½-strength MS media with 0.8% agar square plates in growth chambers

264

(Sanyo/Panasonic, Japan) that had a 16-h day length (150–200 µE/m2s), a constant

265

temperature of 22 °C and 70% humidity. Seeds were sterilized before sowing in 10% sodium

266

hypochlorite in 70% EtOH solution.

267

GUS staining for reporter lines analysis:

268

14 days old Arabidopsis seedlings which were grown in ½ MS medium were incubated in

269

staining solution containing 1 mM X-Gluc in 100 mM Na3PO4 (pH 7.2), 0.1% Triton X-100, 5

270

mM K3Fe(CN)6 and 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6 for 24 h at 37°C. Seedlings were then cleared in 70%

271

ethanol for 2 days and mounted in 50% v/v glycerol before observations. After GUS staining

272

the pictures were taken using the Leica M60 stereo microscope.

273

RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and qPCR.

274

Total RNA from three-week-old or 14-day-old plants was isolated using the TRIzol™

275

reagent (Invitrogen) and a Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research). The RNA was then

276

cleaned with Turbo™ DNase (Invitrogen) according to the provided protocol.

277

transcription reaction was performed with Superscript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen)

278

and oligo-dT primer. qPCR was performed with Power SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (Applied

279

Biosystems) using a QuantStudio™ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The

280

expression levels were calculated with the 2-ΔΔCt method. The Mann-Whitney U test was used

281

for statistical analyses.

282

Chromatin Immunoprecpitation

283

Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using nuclei isolated from crosslinked (1%

284

formaldehyde) 21-day old leaves, as described in (Bowler, Benvenuto et al. 2004) with minor

285

modifications. Sonic and IP buffer were prepared as described in (Kaufmann, Muino et al.

286

2010). Chromatin was sonicated at 4°C with a Diagenode Bioruptor Plus at high intensity for

287

30 min (30 s on/30 s off) to obtain 200-300 bp DNA fragment size. Antibodies against total

288

RNA Pol II (Abcam ab817) were used with Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Scientific). Protein–

289

DNA complexes were eluted from the beads as described in (Rowley, Bohmdorfer et al. 2013)

290

and DNA was purified using a column-based method. DNA libraries were obtained using

291

MicroPlex Library Preparation Kit (Diagenode) and sequenced on HiSeq HO 125 SE (Fasteris).

292

Reads were trimmed to 50bp and aligned to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10) using Bowtie

293

(wit parameters -M1 –n2) (Langmead, Trapnell et al. 2009). Duplicate reads were removed by

294

SAMtools (Li, Handsaker et al. 2009). Remaining sequences were extended to 200bp according

295

to ChIP fragment length. Plots of RNA Pol II distribution were made using ngs.plot software

296

(Shen, Shao et al. 2014). Genomic coordinates of MIR genes were taken from mirEX2 data base

297

(Zielezinski, Dolata et al. 2015).

298

In situ immunolocalization of DRB1 and RNA polymerase II

299

The double immunodetection experiments were performed according to the protocol

300

described in (Bhat, Bielewicz et al. 2019). For HYL1 localization primary rabbit antibodies

301

(Agrisera, AS06 136) diluted to 1:200 were used. After the double labeling assay, the slides

302

were stained for DNA detection with Hoechst 33342 (Life Technology, USA) and mounted in

303

ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies).

304

Co-immunpreciptation of partner proteins of DRB1

305

For each co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), nuclear extract was prepared like described above.

306

Proteins were extracted from nuclear pellet by resuspending it in nuclear lysis buffer (10%

307

sucrose, 100mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 5mM EDTA, 5mM EGTA, 300mM NaCl, 0.75% Triton X-100,

308

0.15% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 1mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1x cOmplete™ EDTA-free

309

protease inhibitor (Roche)) and sonicated 2 cycle x 30 second ON/ 30 second OFF using

310

Bioruptor® Plus (Diagenode). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation (5 min, 16000g, 4

311

°C) the cleared supernatants were diluted 1 time using water containing 1x cOmplete ™ EDTA-

312

free protease inhibitor (Roche). Protein extract was incubated overnight with anti-HA

313

antibodies (Roche). After over-night incubation, Dynabeads with protein G were added and

314

samples were incubated for 1h. After incubation, beads were washed 2 times with low salt

315

buffer (20mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 2mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), 1 time

316

with high salt buffer (20mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 2mM EDTA, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1%

317

SDS), 1 time LiCl buffer (10mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 1mM EDTA, 250mM LiCl, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS,

318

1% sodium deoxycholate) and twice with TE (100mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 1mM EDTA). Beads

319

containing proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Control IPs were performed in Col-

320

0 using anti-HA antibodies.

321

Mass spectrometry analyses were performed by IBB PAS, Warsaw. Magnetic beads

322

containing proteins were suspended in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, reduced using

323

100 mM DTT for 30 min at 57 °C and alkylated in 50 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min at RT in the

324

dark. In the next step proteins were digested overnight using 100 ng/µl trypsin (Promega) at

325

37°C. Peptide mixtures were separated using Nano-Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograpy

326

coupled to Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo). Peptides were identified with Mascot

327

algorithm (Matrix Science, London, UK) and searched against the TAIR10 database. The total

328

number of MS/MS fragmentation spectra was used to quantify each protein from at least

329

three independent biological replicates. Biological replicates consisted of plants of the same

330

genotype grown at different dates and in different growth chambers. For the statistical

331

analysis we compared the data from three independent experiments for pDRB1:DRB1:HA.

332

Statistical analysis was perform with DESEq2 R-package (Love, Huber et al. 2014).

333

Analysis of RNA-seq data

334

RNA-seq data from wild type, hyl1-2 and se-3 was downloaded from published dataset under

335

the accession number ERP001616 (Manavella, Hagmann et al. 2012). Raw reads were trimmed

336

(first 20 nucleotides) with FASTX-Toolkit, adapters were removed using Trimmomatic and

337

rRNA sequences where removed with Bowtie (Langmead, Trapnell et al. 2009, Bolger, Lohse

338

et al. 2014). Clean reads were aligned to the Arabidopis TAIR10 reference genome using

339

HISAT2 (Kim, Langmead et al. 2015). The overall alignment rate was 98-99% for each sample.

340

Next, prepDE.py script was used to extract count information from StringTie output and
