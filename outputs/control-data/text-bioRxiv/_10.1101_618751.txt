Abstract
To accelerate the shift to bio-based production and overcome complicated functional
implementation of natural and artificial biosynthetic pathways to industry relevant organisms,
development of new, versatile, bio-based production platforms is required. Here we present a novel
yeast platform for biosynthesis of bacterial aromatic polyketides. The platform is based on a
synthetic polyketide synthase system enabling a first demonstration of bacterial aromatic polyketide
biosynthesis in a eukaryotic host.

Introduction
An increasing number of chemicals are being produced by environmentally-friendly biobased synthesis1,2 to overcome the problems of low-yielding chemical synthesis or solvent-heavy
extraction from natural resources, for achieving a sustainable way of life. Unfortunately,
development of microbial cell factories for the bio-based production of desired chemicals often
requires significant amount of time, resources and efforts to meet industrial demand, hence the shift
towards bio-based production is slow. Also in many cases native hosts are not suitable for industrial
conditions due to low production level and/or complicated culturing conditions, necessitating the
use of a heterologous hosts such as Escherichia coli or yeast3,4. However, production of natural
products, such as polyketides, in heterologous hosts has proven difficult or even impossible5–7. To
overcome these limitations, standardized, versatile and programmable biosynthesis platforms in
genetically traceable, and robust hosts are desired.
Polyketides are a large class of bioactive natural compounds found widely in fungi (type I
iterative and type II ), bacteria (mostly type II, but also type I modular and type III) and plants (type
III), possessing a variety of biological activities, including antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal,

antiviral and many more8–11. As a consequence, polyketides have been, and still are, major leads in
drug discovery programs11–14.
The most diverse and widely studied polyketides are originating from bacteria11. Complex
bacterial aromatic polyketides can be produced through non-reducing polyketide pathways, where
two-carbon units (-CH2-CO-, ketides) are polymerized into linear polyketide chains of various
length by multicomponent enzyme complexes known as polyketide synthase (minimal PKS), and
then can be folded to form aromatic structures15–17. Folding in most bacterial systems is facilitated
by aromatases and cyclases, and the resulting products are further modified by other classes of
tailoring enzymes that closely interact with the minimal PKS18. From the bioengineering point of
view, bacterial type II PKS systems offer flexibility in terms of choice from vast amount of
aromatases, cyclases and tailoring enzymes to allow for the rational engineering of pathways to
form desirable aromatic compounds19 and to develop programmable polyketide production
platforms. Development and optimization of such a production platform in native bacterial hosts
can be troublesome due to the lack of genetic tools, production of unwanted toxic metabolites,
complicated culturing conditions, and low or conditional production of desired compounds3,4,20.
Unfortunately, bacterial type II PKSs have not yet proven possible to express in eukaryotes15. In
contrast, plant (type III) PKSs, that ultimately form aromatic compounds, via linear non-reduced
polyketide intermediates, consist of a single enzyme21 and can be expressed in heterologous
eukaryotic hosts to form a polyketide chain of varied length, yet the lack of characterized cyclases,
aromatases and tailoring enzymes in plant PKS systems limits the use of type III PKSs for versatile
polyketide biosynthesis22,23. Although, recently it was demonstrated that it is possible to
functionally combine the activity of plant type III PKS with bacterial type II PKS related cyclase
and aromatase in plants and filamentous fungi23,24

Here, we describe a first-of-its-kind programmable polyketide production platform in the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, based on combining the synthesis of a polyketide (octaketide) by
plant-based type III octaketide synthase (OKS) from Aloe arborescens to produce type II polyketide
products from benzoisochromanequinone antibiotic - actinorhodin pathway (Act) from
Streptomyces coelicolor.

Results
Expression of Act gene cluster in yeast
First, we reconstructed a widely studied actinorhodin pathway25 by integrating required
codon optimized genes into the yeast genome together with its bacterial minimal PKS (Figure 1A).
Gene assemblies and genomic integrations were performed in 2-3 steps by first performing in vivo
assembly of expression units in Escherichia coli, and second by using our recently developed
CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering techniques to integrate the assembled gene expression units into
the yeast genome (Supplementary Table 1)26,27. Since actinorhodin and other intermediates in the
pathway have color28, successful production through the pathway was initially expected to be
assessed by visual inspection of engineered yeast. However, from the first designs, no apparent or
very modest color was observed in yeast cells harboring actinorhodin pathway (Supplementary
Figure 1; TC-140, TC-156). To mitigate the lack of (or modest) visual phenotypes we next
investigated if all proteins from the Act pathway were successfully expressed using whole cell
proteomics. From this analysis it was evident that most of Act proteins were detected except for
ActVI-2 (dehydrogenase) and ActI-1 (3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase), the latter of which is needed for
the first committed step of the minimal ActPKS (Supplementary Figure 2). Further, we aimed to
elucidate which metabolites, if any, are produced from first generation Act pathway design. Since
none of the reported pathway metabolites are commercially available as standards, we performed

comparative LC-MS metabolite profiling using wild type S. coelicolor whole cell extract as a
standard. This analysis indicated that none of the described intermediates from the Act pathway or
Act itself were detected in the engineered yeast strains (Figure 1B; TC-140, TC-156), hinting that
the Act - type II PKS indeed was not functionally expressed or correctly assembled into a functional
PKS in yeast.
Replacement of Act minimal PKS with AaOKS
To overcome the lack of function of type II PKS we replaced the Act minimal PKS with a
type III octaketide synthase from plant A. arborescens (AaOKS)29, which was described to produce
a polyketide product with an identical chain-length as Act. Hence, the second generation production
strains were created by replacing the actinorhodin minimal PKS with AaOKS, but retaining the rest
of the actinorhodin pathway (Figure 1a). The first strain design expressing AaOKS indeed displayed
pigmented colonies indicating the production of Act cluster metabolites (Supplementary Figure 1;
TC-158). We further investigated expression optimization of AaOKS by integrating either a singlecopy of the AaOKS gene into the genome or expressing the AaOKS from a high-copy plasmid. As
judged from phenotypic inspection, only the Act pathway strain expressing AaOKS from a highcopy plasmid gave rise to pigmented colonies potentially derived from Act pathway metabolites
(Supplementary Figure 1; TC-160 vs. TC-158). Further, from comparative metabolite profiling, the
four main products (bicyclic intermediate, (S)-chiral alcohol, (S)-hemiketal, dihydrokalafungin)
from the Act pathway were tentatively observed in this strain (Figure 1b; TC-158), while no
production was observed in the wt control (TC-3), or strains i) expressing Act pathway without a
PKS (TC-156), ii) expressing Act pathway and single-copy of AaOKS (TC-160), or wt control
expressing AaOKS in either single- or high-copy (TC-179 or TC-180) without the Act pathway
(Figure 1b). The other major intermediate (S)-DNPA from the Act pathway could not be detected or
confirmed reliably, most likely because this product was metabolized rapidly by Act pathway

enzymes. By comparative LC-MS analyses, based on known mass and published UV data30, and
direct comparison to S. coelicolor metabolites, we observed accumulation of a compound expected
to be dihydrokalafungin (DHK), as a final product (Figure 1b; TC-158). DHK is known to possess
anticancer, antifungal, antiparasitic properties, and it is a potential drug target31,32. To further
investigate the compound putatively identified as DHK, we performed more thorough analysis
including LC-MS/MS, as no standards were commercially available. These results indicated that
DHK was indeed being produced in the engineered yeast strain as its MS/MS fragmentation pattern
was the same in both engineered yeast strain and S. coelicolor (Supplementary Figure 3).
Optimization of aromatic polyketide production platform
To optimize the platform strain further for production of type II polyketide compounds, we
next integrated a second copy of each of the four genes encoding ActVI-3, ActVI-2, ActVA-6,
ActVB (Figure 2a), all showing low abundances as evaluated from whole cell proteomics analysis
(Supplementary Figure 4). Upon overexpression of the four genes, the colonies became more
intensely colored (Supplementary Figure 1; TC-167). To investigate if this phenotype could be
correlated with increased DHK production, we performed comparative metabolite profiling by LCMS, and noted that production of the DHK was indeed increased (Figure 2b; TC-158 vs. TC-167).
Next, we aimed to produce one of the most widely studied model antibiotics, actinorhodin,
(a dimer of DHK) in both non-optimized (TC-158) and optimized (TC-167) yeast platform strains.
DHK dimerization, as previously described30, is potentially catalyzed by the enzyme ActVA-4
(Figure 2a), which initially was not introduced into the yeast platform strains. Introduction of the
dimeraze should allow for dimerization of DHK and production of the actinorhodin. However, as
judged by the color of yeast colonies (Supplementary Figure 1; TC-171 with the non-optimized Act
pathway and TC-172 with the optimized Act pathway), no significant changes were observed after
introduction of the dimerase. Further analysis by comparative LC-MS corroborated the phenotypic

result revealing no detectable actinorhodin in the yeast strains (Supplementary Figure 5). In
addition, actinorhodin and its intermediates can also be toxic to yeast, and accumulated amounts
could inhibit cell growth, and potentially compromise actinorhodin production. We tested this
hypothesis by growing wt yeast in serial dilutions of conditioned medium where S. coelicolor had
previously been grown. According to our LC-MS analysis (Figure 1b), this medium contained Act
pathway metabolites together with actinorhodin. Here it was observed that growth of yeast cells was
completely inhibited in 2x and 4x diluted conditioned medium, and even modestly compromised in
8x diluted conditioned medium (Supplementary Figure 6), while yeast cultivated in standard ISP2
medium displayed normal growth behaviour, thus indicating toxicity of Act pathway metabolites.
Further, it was also observed that engineered yeast strains, producing DHK, showed reduced
growth, as judged by colony size and growth profiling (Supplementary Figure 1; strains: TC-158,
TC-167, TC-171; Supplementary Figure 7).
Versatility and programmability of the system
The main goal of this study was to create a versatile and programmable platform for
production of bacterial aromatic polyketides. To prove that our polyketide production platform can
be engineered to express different polyketide synthesis modules, we replaced several key Act
enzymes with enzymes from other Streptomyces species to achieve production of desired products
(Figure 3a). For this purpose, we reconstructed the Act pathway in yeast so that ActVI-2
(dehydrogenase), ActVI-4 (dehydrogenase), ActVA-5 (hydroxylase) and ActVB (flavin:NADH
oxidoreductase) from the Act pathway were replaced with enzymes Med-9 (dehydrogenase), Med29 (dehydrogenase), Med-7 (oxygenase) and Med-13 (oxidoreductase), respectively, from the
medermycin biosynthesis pathway (Med pathway)33 (Figure 3a). Next, we first phenotypically
assessed the reprogrammed yeast strains (Supplementary figure 1; TC-175, TC-177), which
provided an indication if the enzymes can be functionally replaced in the platform strains. Further,

we investigated production of desired compounds with comparative metabolite profiling by LCMS. LC-MS analysis revealed that detected metabolites are indeed the Med pathway intermediates
in both strains with 2-4 enzymatic steps replaced by enzymes from Med pathway (Figure 3b; TC175, TC-177). These results indicate that the developed platform system can be reprogrammed and
employed for production of diverse bacterial polyketide compounds.

Discussion
In summary, we have developed a functional first-of-its-kind eukaryotic production platform
for bacterial polyketide derived products by employing a plant type III polyketide synthase to
produce compounds originally found only in bacteria. As a proof-of-concept we engineered and
optimized our platform in S. cerevisiae to successfully produce a compound identified as bioactive
bacterial polyketide DHK. Finally, we further demonstrated versatility and programmability of our
system by replacing key enzymes in Act pathway with enzymes from different Streptomyces
species to produce desired products. Such characterisation confirms ability of the system to
functionalize and produce octaketide derived products in a well-described, eukaryotic production
work-horse. We envision our platform to be useful for production of many novel compounds,
including novel antibiotics, characterization and functionalization of them, and moreover,
sustainable production through cell factories.

Strains, plasmids and media
The yeast strains used here were isogenic to CEN.PK2-1C. Strains and plasmids are listed
in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Yeast cells were grown in complete medium (YPD)
with 2% glucose and synthetic complete (SC) from Sigma, supplemented with 2% glucose. E. coli

strains were propagated in LB medium supplemented with 200 mg of ampicillin, Streptomyces
strain was grown in ISP2 medium with 4% glucose.
All primer names and sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 4.
Plasmid and strain construction
To create polyketide expressing strains large set of genes were integrated by using advanced
CRISPR/Cas9 technology26,27. To create expression cassettes, respective genes were codon
optimized for yeast and ordered (Integrated DNA Technologies) as gene blocks. Gene blocks were
amplified using corresponding primers (Supplementary Table 4) and first USER cloned with single
or bi-directional promoters to yeast integrative plasmids as described in previously published
method27. All created integrative plasmids with corresponding expression units are listed in
Supplementary Table 3. By employing previously detailed procedure27, all integrative plasmids
were linearized and with their corresponding gRNA plasmids transformed to yeast expressing Cas9
for integration of desired genes to the genome. Due to large number of genes to be integrated, this
has been processed in 2-3 steps. In a single transformation 4-6 genes were introduced and created
strain used for the next round of transformation until all pathway genes were integrated. All the
other plasmids and strains were created in the same way as previously described27.
Metabolite extraction
Yeast cells were cultured in 50 ml SC selective or YPD medium for 168 hours at 30oC,
shaking 250rpm. Streptomyces cells were grown in ISP2 medium for 168 hours at 30oC, shaking
250rpm. Cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in ethyl acetate, which was
acidified with 10% acetic acid. Resuspended cells where mixed with 0,5 µM acid washed glass
beads (Sigma) and bead beated to break the cells. Lysates were centrifuged and upper ethyl acetate
layer with extracted metabolites was collected. Ethyl acetate was evaporated and extracts
resuspended in methanol for further analysis by LC-MS.

Whole cell proteomics
The yeast cultures were grown in YPD medium in triplicates. Exponentially growing cells
were harvested (totally OD600 - 20) and cell pellets flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
To prepare for protein lysis and precipitation, the yeast cell pellets were treated with 0.5 uL
(2.5 U) of Zymolyase in 200 uL of 1 M Sorbitol 0.1 M EDTA at 37 ºC for 30 min to digest cell
walls and centrifuged at 20,817 x g for 1 minute. The supernatant was removed before continuing
with a chloroform-methanol extraction as described previously, which was achieved by the addition
of 80 µL of methanol, 20 µL of chloroform, and 60 µL of water, with vortexing followed by
centrifugation at 20,817 x g for 1 minute to induce phase separation. The methanol and water layer
was removed and then 100 µL of methanol was added and the sample with vortexing briefly
followed by centrifugation for 1 minute. The chloroform and methanol mixture was removed by
pipetting to isolate the protein pellet. The protein pellet was resuspended in 100 mM ammonium
bicarbonate (AMBIC) with 20% methanol and quantified by the Lowry method (Bio-Rad DC
assay). A total of 100 µg of protein was reduced by adding tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)
to a final concentration of 5 mM for 30 minutes, followed by alkylation by adding iodoacetamide at
a final concentration of 10 mM with incubation for 30 mins, and subsequently digested overnight at
37 ºC with trypsin at a ratio of 1:50 (w/w) trypsin:total protein.
Peptides were analyzed using an Agilent 1290 liquid chromatography system coupled to an
Agilent 6460QQQ mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) operating in MRM
mode. Peptide samples (10 µg) were separated on an Ascentis Express Peptide ES-C18 column (2.7
µm particle size, 160 Å pore size, 50 mm length x 2.1 mm i.d., 60 ºC; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) by using a chromatographic gradient (400 µL/min flow rate) with an initial condition of 95%
Buffer A (99.9% water, 0.1% formic acid) and 5% Buffer B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid)
then increasing linearly to 65% Buffer A/35% Buffer B over 5.5 minutes. Buffer B was then

increased to 80% over 0.3 minutes and held at 80% for two minutes followed by ramping back
down to 5% Buffer B over 0.5 minutes where it was held for 1.5 minutes to re-equilibrate the
column for the next sample. The data were acquired using Agilent MassHunter, version B.08.02,
processed using Skyline version 4.1, and peak quantification was refined with mProphet in Skyline.

available via ProteomeXchange with identifier: PXD013388.
Comparative metabolite profiling by LC-MS and data analysis
LC-MS analysis was performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 ultra-high-performance
liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to a UV/Vis diode array detector (DAD) and a highresolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). UV-Vis detection was done using a DAD-3000 in the range 200 –
700 nm. Injections of 5 µL of each sample were separated using a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C-18 column
(2.1 × 100 mm, 1.8 µm) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min, and a
temperature of 35.0 °C. Mobile phases A and B were 0.1 % formic acid in water and acetonitrile,
respectively. Elution was performed with a 17 min multistep system. After 5 % B for 0.3 min, a
linear gradient started from 5 % B to 100 % B in 13 min, which was held for another 2 min and
followed by re-equilibration to 5 % B until 17 min. HRMS was performed in ESI-, with a spray
voltage of 2,750 V respectively, in the mass range range (m/z) 100-1,000 at a resolution of 120,000,
RF Lens 50 %, and AGC target 2e5. Before analysis, the MS was calibrated using ESI Negative on
Calibration Solution (P/N 88324, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, USA).
LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out using data-dependent MS/MS analysis by analyzing the
most intense ions form the full-scan using a master scan time of 1.0 s. Dynamic exclusion was used
to exclude ions for 20 s after two measurements within 30 s. Fragmentation was performed using

expressed in yeast, including enzymes and chemical compounds produced through the pathway.
Enzymes are listed in blue and green, blue arrows depict chemical reactions catalyzed by listed
enzymes and produced compounds are depicted in blue or red shade. b, Chromatograms from
comparative LC-MS metabolomics showing investigated metabolites in yeast. The main products or
intermediates investigated by LC-MS were bicyclic intermediate, (S)-chiral alcohol, (S)-hemiketal,
(S)-DNPA, dihydrokalafungin (DHK). Metabolites from the natural actinorhodin producer S.
coelicolor were used as a standard (positive control) for comparing metabolites produced in wt and
engineered yeast strains: TC-3, TC-140, TC-160, TC-156, TC-158, TC-179, TC-180. Red vertical
lines on chromatograms depict the peaks of listed compounds based on known mass and positive
control. Intensities of the peaks and elution times are shown on the corresponding axis.
