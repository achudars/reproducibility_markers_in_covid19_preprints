Abstract
Invasion of, development within, and exit from hepatocytes by Plasmodium is essential for the
parasite to establish the malaria-causing erythrocytic cycle. Identification of signaling pathways
that operate during the pre-erythrocytic cycle provides insights into a critical stage of infection and
potential targets for chemoprevention of disease. Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPK)
represent a kinase family that is present in Plasmodium but absent in mammals. We demonstrate
that P. berghei homologs of CDPK1, CDPK4 and CDPK5 play overlapping but distinct roles in
sporozoite invasion and parasite egress from hepatocytes. All three kinases are expressed in
sporozoites. All three are required for optimal motility of sporozoites and consequently their
invasion of hepatocytes. Increased cGMP compensates for the functional loss of CDPK1 and
CDPK5 during sporozoite invasion but cannot overcome CDPK4’s loss. CDPK1 and CDPK5
expression is downregulated after sporozoite invasion. CDPK5 reappears in a subset of late stage
liver stages and is present in all merosomes. Chemical inhibition of CDPK4 and depletion of
CDPK5 in liver stages suggests that these kinases play a role in the formation and/or release of
merosomes from mature liver stages. Furthermore, depletion of CDPK5 in merosomes
significantly delays a merosome-initiated erythrocytic cycle without affecting the infectivity of
hepatic merozoites. These data suggest that CDPK5 is required for the release of hepatic
merozoites from merosomes. Our work provides the first evidence that sporozoite invasion
requires CDPK1 and CDPK5 and that the release of hepatic merozoites is a regulated process.

Significance
The malaria-parasite Plasmodium begins its mammalian cycle by infecting hepatocytes in the liver.
A single parasite differentiates into tens of thousands of hepatic merozoites which exit the host
cell in vesicles called merosomes. Hepatic merozoites initiate the first round of erythrocytic
infection that leads to disease symptoms. We show that optimal invasion of liver cells by
Plasmodium requires the action of three closely-related parasite kinases, CDPK1, 4 and 5. Loss of
any of the three enzymes in the parasite significantly reduces infection of liver cells. CDPK5 is
also required for the release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes and therefore for initiating the
erythrocytic cycle. A better understanding of how these kinases function could lead to drugs that
prevent malaria.
Introduction
Parasite genomes are generally small in size with a great deal of functional optimization. The
presence of gene families suggests that in some cases, structurally related proteins play redundant
or complementary functions. One such gene family in the malaria-causing parasite, Plasmodium
encodes Calcium Dependent Protein kinases (CDPK) that in addition to Apicomplexan parasites
is found only in plants, protists, green alga and oomycetes (1). CDPKs are serine-threonine kinases
that are activated by the direct binding of Ca2+ to EF-hand domains in their regulatory region. The
ability to bind Ca2+ directly enables CDPKs to act both as sensors and effectors of intracellular
Ca2+.
The human-infective species, P. falciparum encodes at least 7 members (2). The rodent-infective
species, P. berghei encodes orthologs for all members except for P. falciparum CDPK2. The
function of different CDPKs have been extensively examined in the asexual cycle in erythrocytes
and during parasite transmission to and development within mosquitoes. These studies have
revealed distinct and overlapping roles for different CDPK members during merozoite invasion
and egress, gametogenesis and ookinete invasion. In the asexual cycle, CDPK5 is required for
merozoite egress (3, 4), and CDPK1 and CDPK4 play non-essential roles in merozoite invasion
(5, 6). Although invasion by P. berghei merozoites is reduced when CDPK4 is lost together with
decreased function of cGMP dependent protein kinase (PKG) but the loss of CDPK4 alone does
not affect asexual growth of P. berghei or of P. falciparum (6). Similarly, in the background of
simultaneous decrease in PKG and CDPK4 functions, CDPK1’s loss decreases merozoite invasion
(6, 7) but its individual loss is tolerated in the asexual cycle (6, 8, 9). CDPK2, CDPK3 and CDPK6
do not appear to play significant roles in the asexual cycle (10-13). During the parasite’s sexual
cycle in the mosquito midgut, CDPK1, CDPK2 and CDPK4 are essential for male gametogenesis
with CDPK4 regulating at least 3 distinct cell cycle events (13-18). Ookinete motility requires
CDPK3 (10, 11) as it regulates the secretion of adhesins required for motility. CDPK1 and CDPK4
also contribute to ookinete motility: simultaneous loss of both reduced ookinete speed in vitro (6).
These studies of different CDPK family members in the mosquito transmissive stages has provided
biological validation for targeting P. falciparum CDPK1 and CDPK4 to chemically block parasite
transmission from mammalian host to mosquitoes.
Sporozoites and liver stages express several CDPKs (8, 12, 19) but, in contrast to our knowledge
in asexual and sexual cycles, little is known of CDPKs’ functions during the pre-erythrocytic cycle.

CDPK4 and CDPK6 function in invasion by P. berghei sporozoites since their loss reduces the
percentage of sporozoites that enter hepatocytes (12, 19) while deletion of CDPK1 in sporozoites
did not reveal a significant defect in parasite invasion of or egress from hepatocytes (8). These
results suggested that other CDPKs could play a compensatory and complementary role during
sporozoite invasion and parasite exit from hepatocytes.
Here we examine the role of CDPK1, CDPK4 and CDPK5 in sporozoite motility, traversal
through, invasion of and egress from infected hepatocytes, using conditional protein depletion in
the rodent model, P. berghei. P. berghei offers the distinct advantage of an experimentally
accessible pre-erythrocytic cycle. We demonstrate that in P. berghei sporozoites, CDPK1
(PBANKA_0314200), CDPK4 (PBANKA_0615200) and CDPK5 (PBANKA_1351500) are
individually required for motility. The loss of each kinase decreases sporozoite motility and
consequently significantly reduces their invasion of hepatocytes. CDPK5 is required for parasite
egress from hepatocytes and for release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes. Our study is the
first demonstration of CDPK1’s and CDPK5’s role in sporozoite invasion. Furthermore, it
provides evidence that release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes is a regulated process that
requires CDPK5.
Results
CDPK1, CDPK4 and CDPK5 have dynamic expression patterns during the pre-erythrocytic
cycle. Since CDPK1, 4, 5 have essential roles in the asexual and sexual cycles, genetic analyses of
their functions in pre-erythrocytic stages requires conditional mutagenesis. We adapted a method
for conditional protein degradation previously described in P. berghei asexual stages and
ookinetes. Here, a target protein is tagged with an Auxin-induced degron (AID) in Ostir1expressing transgenic P. berghei (20). The tag targets the protein for rapid proteasomal degradation
upon the addition of the plant hormone, auxin (Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We constructed parasite
lines, CDPK4-aid-HA and CDPK5-aid-HA, in which either CDPK4 or CDPK5 were fused with
an AID domain and tagged with an HA2x epitope (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B). These two parasite
lines and a previously reported CDPK1-aid-HA line (20) were transmitted to mosquitoes for
recovery of sporozoites from salivary glands.
Microscopic examination of midguts revealed fewer oocysts in mosquitoes infected with CDPK1aid-HA or CDPK4-aid-HA parasites compared to mosquitoes infected with an isogenic control
(data not shown). Oocyst numbers in mosquitoes infected with CDPK5-aid-HA were equivalent
to control (data not shown). Since genomic deletions of CDPK1 and CDPK4 abolish male
gametogenesis (15, 16), decreased numbers of oocysts in CDPK1-aid-HA and CDPK4-aid-HA
lines suggest that the AID-HA2x domain either interferes with the activities, expression or
localization of CDPK1 and CDPK4 and therefore, partially impairs gametogenesis in these lines.
Consistent with reduced midgut infection in CDPK1-aid-HA and CDPK4-aid-HA and normal
midgut infection in CDPK5-aid-HA, there was a significant decrease in the average number of
salivary gland sporozoites in CDPK1-aid-HA or CDPK4-aid-HA lines but the decrease in ones
infected with CDPK5-aid-HA was not significant (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Despite reduced
numbers of CDPK1-aid-HA and CDPK5-aid-HA sporozoites, we obtained sufficient parasites to
conduct our analyses. Due to the low numbers of CDPK4-aid-HA sporozoites, their analysis was
more limited.

We began functional interrogation of CDPKs in the pre-erythrocytic cycle by examining their
temporal and spatial protein expression in sporozoites and liver stages. We previously reported the
presence of CDPK4 in sporozoites and intracellular liver stage parasites formed 24-65 h post
infection (p.i.) of HepG2 cells (19). Here we demonstrate that CDPK1 and CDPK5 are also present
in sporozoites (Fig. 1) and are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In liver stages, expression of
the three kinases is dynamic. CDPK1 and CDPK5 were not detected in early liver stages 24-48 h
p.i (Fig. 1). At 65 h p.i., when liver stages are close to exiting the hepatocyte, CDPK5 was detected
in a subset of liver stages where it sometimes partially co-localized with P. berghei PKG (PbPKG)
at the periphery of the infected cell (Fig. 1B). CDPK5 expression correlated with developmental
maturity since, in the same culture, liver stages that express it were significantly larger in size
compared to those that did not have detectable CDPK5 (Fig. 1C). CDPK5’s appearance in mature
liver stages suggested its expression may coincide temporally with parasite egress from the
infected hepatocyte. Therefore, we examined its expression in merosomes and detached cells
released at 65-67h p.i. CDPK5 was detectable in all merosomes/ detached cells and localized to
the merosomes periphery, most likely at the membrane (Fig. 2). PbPKG was also present in at the
merosome periphery but the two kinases did not display significant co-localization.
We have previously shown that PbPKG is required for merosomes formation or release (19, 21).
To obtain a better understanding of the subcellular localization of PbPKG in developing liver
stages, we colocalized it with Exp1, a resident protein of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane,
HSP70, a cytoplasmic protein and MSP1, a resident protein of the parasite plasma membrane (Fig.
3). PbPKG colocalized with Exp1 but not HSP70 or MSP1. Taken together, these data suggest that
in developing liver stages, PbPKG associates with the vacuole membrane. After membrane
breakdown in mature liver stages, PbPKG becomes associated with the hepatocyte membrane and
is in close proximity to CDPK5. During merosomes formation, the two proteins are associated
with the hepatocyte membrane that envelops hepatic merozoites as they are released from the
infected cell in the form of merosomes.
Validation of AID-mediated conditional protein degradation in pre-erythrocytic stages. The
unique expression profiles of CDPK1, 4 and 5 in pre-erythrocytic stages suggested some
overlapping but also distinct roles. We tested the function of the three kinases in the preerythrocytic cycle using conditional protein depletion. We tested the efficiency of IAA-mediated
protein degradation in CDPK1-aid and CDPK5-aid sporozoites. In both cases, Western blot
analysis of protein lysates demonstrated an almost complete loss of AID-tagged proteins (Fig. 4A).
Since CDPK5-aid-HA protein migrated faster than its predicted molecular weight, we confirmed
its loss in IAA-treated sporozoites using immunofluorescence assays (Supplementary Fig. 1D). In
addition, we confirmed its loss in released merosomes treated with IAA (Fig. 4B).
Next, we examined if conditions required for protein degradation of AID-tagged proteins
have non-specific effects on parasites. We tested IAA’s effect on motility, invasion, infectivity
and egress of isogenic control sporozoites that lack AID-tagged proteins, Ostir1 (20). Motility was
quantified by live imaging sporozoites after treating with IAA or vehicle (Movie 1-2). The
percentage of Ostir1 sporozoites that moved in complete circles was similar in both conditions 36% of vehicle-treated (n = 175) and 33% of IAA-treated (n =165). Sporozoite invasion was
determined by quantifying the percentage of IAA- and vehicle-treated sporozoites that enter
HepG2 cells within 90 min. Their intracellular development was assessed by quantifying the

number of liver stages present in HepG2 cells after addition of IAA or vehicle to sporozoiteinfected HepG2 cultures 2-14 p.i. (Fig. 4C). There was no significant effect of IAA treatment on
sporozoite invasion or on liver stage development as the fraction of sporozoites that entered cells
and the number of liver stages was similar in sporozoites treated with IAA or vehicle (Fig. 4C).
Effect of IAA on parasite egress from hepatocytes was examined by quantifying the number of
merosomes present in media of control-infected HepG2 cells treated with IAA 48-65 h p.i. IAA
treatment did not significantly affect merosome release, demonstrating that it does not affect egress
of control parasites. We conclude that IAA treatment specifically targets aid-HA proteins and does
not have a deleterious effect on sporozoites. Therefore, IAA-mediated conditional degradation of
proteins is a powerful tool for studying protein function in Plasmodium’s pre-erythrocytic cycle.
CDPK1, CDPK4 and CDPK5 are required for sporozoite motility. In vitro, sporozoites display
a variety of movement patterns – moving in continuous circles (gliding), waving with one end
attached to the substrate, attached with no movement or a combination of the previous three (22).
Motility is accompanied by dynamic changes in intracellular Ca2+ (23). Ca2+ flux regulates
secretion of adhesins onto the sporozoite surface that mediate attachment to the substrate, and
turnover of adhesion sites between the sporozoite and substrate during movement (23, 24). To
examine the role of CDPK1, CDPK4 and CDPK5 as Ca2+effectors during motility, we examined
the effect of their loss on sporozoite motility.
Depletion of CDPK1, CDPK4 or CDPK5 had no significant effect on sporozoite
attachment to the substrate but sporozoites no longer demonstrated circular movement (Movie 38, Fig. 5A). Instead, they stayed attached to the substrate with either one pole (‘waving’) or both
poles attached (22). These results suggest that the formation and efficient turnover of attachment
sites between the sporozoite and the substrate, and consequently sporozoite motility, requires a
threshold of Ca2+ signaling that is reached through the combinatorial function of each of these
kinases. Each kinase can partially but not completely compensate for the loss of another.
In vivo, motility enables sporozoites to disseminate from the site of bite in the skin by
traversing through cell layers, entering a blood vessel and invading a hepatocyte in the liver.
Therefore, we examined if decreased motility that results from CDPK1, 4 or 5 depletion has any
functional effect on cell traversal by sporozoites and their eventual invasion of hepatocytes.
Depletion of CDPK1 or CDPK5 did not decrease cell traversal by sporozoites (Supplementary Fig.
1E). We were unable to test cell traversal in CDPK4-aid-HA sporozoites due to insufficient
sporozoites. Invasion of HepG2 cells decreased by approximately 50% in all IAA-treated
sporozoites (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that CDPK1, CDPK4 and CDPK5 are required for
sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes and they have partially overlapping functions in the process.
Optimal invasion by sporozoites requires all three kinases. The ability of sporozoites to invade
cells despite depletion for CDPK1 or CDPK4 or CDPK5 and an apparent complete loss of circular
motion in vitro likely suggests that motility on glass coverslips is likely an incomplete
representation of sporozoite motility on extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix might
provide a greater number or variety of adhesins using which sporozoites can achieve sufficient
motility.
Decreased invasion by CDPK1-depleted sporozoites is expected to diminish the number of
liver stages formed by these sporozoites. However, previous studies did not find a significant
difference in the number of liver stages formed by sporozoites in which the CDPK1 gene was
deleted using stage-specific DNA excision (CDPK1 cKO) (8). To reconcile these seemingly
contradictory results, we examined the possibility that CDPK1 protein is not significantly reduced

in CDPK1 cKO sporozoites, using immunofluorescence assays (Supplementary Fig. 2). Protein
was clearly detected in these sporozoites and its presence was entirely consistent with the normal
infectivity of CDPK1 cKO sporozoites. In contrast, IAA-mediated CDPK1-aid-HA protein
degradation is more efficient (Fig. 4A). Therefore, conditional degradation of CDPK1 uncovered
its function in sporozoite motility and by extension, in host cell invasion for which motility is a
pre-requisite.
To determine the effect of simultaneous loss of CDPK1 and CDPK4, we generated a
parasite line in which both kinases are tagged with AID-HA (CDPK1-aid-HA/CDPK4-aid-HA)
(data not shown). CDPK1-AID-HA/CDPK4-AID-HA parasites were viable in the erythrocytic
cycle and were transmitted to mosquitoes through a blood meal but they failed to form any salivary
gland sporozoites (data not shown). This negative interaction between modified alleles of CDPK1
and CDPK4 confirms previous reports of epistatic interactions between the kinases during
gametogenesis (6).
As an alternative, we utilized a CDPK4-specific bumped kinase inhibitor compound 1294
(19, 25) to test the effect of simultaneously inhibiting CDPK4, and CDPK1 or CDPK5. Addition
of 1294 (2 µM) to IAA-treated CDPK1-aid-HA and CDPK5-aid-HA sporozoites at the time of
invasion significantly decreased the number of intracellular liver stages present at 48 h p.i.,
compared to liver stages formed by sporozoites treated with IAA or 1294 alone (Fig. 5C-D). We
tested the possibility that 1294’s effect was partly through off-target inhibition of PbPKG, which
has a small amino acid at the gatekeeper position. P. berghei sporozoites expressing PbPKG with
a gatekeeper substitution (T619Q) remain sensitive to 1294 demonstrating that PbPKG is not a
major target of the compound (Supplementary Fig. 3A). Together, these data suggest that CDPK1,
CDPK4 and CDPK5 act together to provide optimal sporozoite invasion.
Since CDPKs act downstream of PbPKG during merozoite invasion of erythrocytes
(CDPK4 and CDPK1 (6, 7) and egress (CDPK5 (4)), we tested if increasing cGMP levels, and
consequently PbPKG signaling, during sporozoite invasion could overcome the loss of CDPK1,
CDPK4 or CDPK5. Zaprinast, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, reversed the effect of depleting either
CDPK1 or CDPK5 individually (Fig. 5C-D). The number of liver stages formed by CDPK1depleted or CDPK5-depleted sporozoites in the presence of zaprinast was indistinguishable from
vehicle-treated sporozoites. However, zaprinast could not overcome simultaneous inhibition of
CDPK4 and either CDPK1 or CDPK5 sporozoites (Fig 6C-D). These results suggest that PbPKG
acts upstream of both CDPK1 and CDPK5 during sporozoite motility and that CDPK4 functions
in a pathway that is at least in part independent of PbPKG.
CDPK5 is required for parasite egress from hepatocytes and from merosomes. Plasmodium’s
entry into the blood stream after exiting the liver is a two-step process. First, merosomes are
extruded from the infected hepatocyte into the blood stream (26, 27). Second, merosomes are
carried intact into the lung microvasculature where they disintegrate and release free hepatic
merozoites that initiate the first round of erythrocytic infection (27). Egress from hepatocytes
requires the activity of parasite PKG (27) and SUB1 (28) but there is little information on processes
required for the release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes.
The presence of CDPK4 and CDPK5 in late liver stages suggests a possible function during
parasite egress from hepatocytes. However, a conditional deletion of CDPK4 gene in sporozoites
did not demonstrate a clear effect on the number of merosomes released in culture (19). We
attempted to confirm these results using IAA-mediated depletion of CDPK4-aid protein in liver
stages but the small number of CDPK4-aid-HA sporozoites made these assays unfeasible. As an

alternative, we tested the effect of chemical inhibition of CDPK4 on merosome formation.
Addition of 1294 to sporozoite-infected HepG2 cells at 48 – 66 h p.i. decreased merosomes
released into media at 66 h p.i (Supplementary Fig. 3B). The different effects of genetic and
chemical inhibition of CDPK4 suggest that parasites can adapt to genetic ablation of CDPK4 in
sporozoites but cannot do so in response to chemical inhibition. Since chemical inhibition of kinase
activity is rapid, it may not allow sufficient time for upregulation of compensatory pathways that
can be upregulated in mutant parasites during their development from sporozoites into merosomes.
Depletion of CDPK5-aid in liver stages, starting 48 h p.i., also reduced the number of
merosomes formed at 65h p.i. Similar treatment of CDPK1-aid-HA-infected HepG2 cells had no
significant effect consistent with the lack of CDPK1 expression in liver stages (Fig. 5E). These
results demonstrate that Ca2+ signaling through CDPK5 is required for parasite exit from
hepatocytes. Since CDPK5 is detected in free merosomes (Fig. 2), we investigated its function in
the release of hepatic merozoites. CDPK5-aid-HA merosomes treated with either IAA or vehicle
prior to being injected intravenously into mice. In order to detect infection by hepatic merozoites,
blood parasitemia was monitored at 24 h p.i. This time-period enables the initiation and completion
of a single asexual cycle in P. berghei. None of the mice infected with CDPK5-depleted
merosomes (n = 20) demonstrated parasitemia at 24 h p.i. while all mice infected with vehicletreated merosomes were positive (Figure 5F). Mice infected with CDPK5-depleted merosomes
became patent on day 3 p.i. (n = 20) and the growth rate of asexual parasites was similar in the
two groups (Supplementary Fig 3C). We conclude that CDPK5’s loss in merosomes does not affect
replication of asexual stages.
The longer pre-patent period and the lower parasitemia at 24h p.i. from CDPK5-depleted
merosomes suggested that CDPK5 plays an important role in the release of hepatic merozoites
from merosomes and/or in their invasion of erythrocytes. To distinguish between these two
possibilities, we tested the effect of CDPK5 depletion of the infectivity of hepatic merozoites. We
manually ruptured vehicle- or IAA-treated CDPK5-aid-HA merosomes prior to their injection into
mice. In this case, all mice were patent at 24 p.i. and the difference in average parasitemias of the
two groups of mice was much smaller (Figure 5F). Together, these results are consistent with a
model in which CDPK5 functions in the rupture of merosome membrane and release of hepatic
merozoites.
Discussion
Initiation of the erythrocytic cycle by hepatic merozoites is possibly the least-understood
step of the malaria infection cycle. Hepatic merozoites have a single opportunity to infect host
cells and their release at the wrong time or place, for example in a non-vascular environment,
would prevent or severely debilitate the launch of the erythrocytic cycle. While there is significant
understanding at the molecular level of events leading to the release of merozoites from infected
erythrocytes, almost nothing is known of how hepatic merozoites are released from merosomes.
We provide strong evidence that release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes is a parasiteregulated process. The breakdown of the merosome membrane is likely a response to
environmental cues that result in Ca2+ flux in merosomes, activation of CDPK5 and release of
proteolytic enzymes.
Depletion of CDPK5 from merosomes does not impair the ability of hepatic merozoites to
invade erythrocytes since manually-released hepatic merozoites from CDPK5-depleted
merosomes initiate erythrocytic infection normally. In contrast, intact merosomes depleted for
CDPK5 exhibit a significant delay in initiating erythrocytic infection as demonstrated by the

significantly lower blood stage parasitemia in mice 24 h p.i.. It has been suggested that a lungreceptor mediated mechanism arrests merosomes in lungs where infection of erythrocytes by
hepatic merozoites is facilitated by the low macrophage density and reduced shear forces in the
pulmonary capillary bed from lower blood velocity (27). We hypothesize that interaction between
merosomes and a tissue-specific receptor could trigger CDPK5-mediated release of hepatic
merozoites. Another mechanism that could account for delayed patency of CDPK5-depleted
merosomes is better clearance by the host immune system. Testing these models requires
development of quantitative assays for release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes. In addition,
it will be interesting to explore if CDPK5’s function during hepatic merozoite release requires
CDPK5 to localize to the merosome membrane.
CDPK5 is also required for the formation of merosomes. The relatively modest effect on
merosomes formation could suggest that CDPK5 primarily functions after merosomes have been
released from the hepatocyte i.e. in the release of hepatic merozoites. Alternatively, CDPK4, which
is also present in liver stages at 65 h p.i., could have a redundant role with CDPK5 in merosome
formation. It is also possible that CDPK5 function in merosome formation is compensated by
PbPKG. We cannot rule out the possibility that IAA-mediated depletion of CDPK5-aid-HA in
intracellular and intravacuolar parasite stages, such as liver stages, is less efficient compared to its
depletion in sporozoites or released merosomes. Incomplete depletion of CDPK5 in liver stages
could provide sufficient protein for close-to-normal function in merosome formation.
The relative dearth of knowledge about the function of CDPKs in pre-erythrocytic stages
can be attributed, in part, to the difficulties faced in functional analyses in pre-erythrocytic stages
of kinases that have indispensable functions in the asexual and sexual cycles. Despite these
challenges, it is important to understand functions of CDPKs in these stages because they
constitute the first step of the mammalian infection, and the study of CDPKs’ in these stages could
identify targets for malaria chemoprevention. In addition, it will provide a fuller view of the stagespecific and stage-transcending functions of different family members. The relative contribution
of different family members in different parasite stages may be determined by the threshold of
Ca2+ signaling required for different cellular processes, the sensitivity of specific kinases to Ca2+
level, their expression level and subcellular localization.
Our work reveals nuances of CDPK signaling in different parasite stages. First, our results
demonstrate a new stage-specific role for CDPK5 - in sporozoite motility and consequently
parasite invasion of hepatocytes. CDPK5 has not been implicated in RBC invasion by merozoites
(4). In contrast to invasion, CDPK5’s role in parasite egress is stage-transcending as it is required
for egress from both erythrocytes and hepatocytes. During the erythrocytic cycle, CDPK5 triggers
micronemal secretion leading to merozoite egress from schizonts (4). How CDPK5 enables release
of hepatic merozoites from merosomes remains to be investigated. Based on its localization to the
merosomes membrane, it is tempting to speculate that CDPK5 could activate a spatially-restricted
protease cascade close to the merosome surface.
Second, our results demonstrate that while different invasive stages may require the same
set of CDPK kinases, the relative contribution of specific kinase members can vary at different
stages or during specific processes. These differences may reflect the different host environments
encountered by the different stages. We show that CDPK1, CDPK4 and CDPK5 have distinct roles
in sporozoite motility and that these functions are only partially overlapping. Depletion of any of
these kinases significantly reduces sporozoite motility. Since IAA-treated sporozoites attach to
the surface, we speculate that their defective motility is likely due to dysregulation in turnover of
adhesion sites that is required for the sporozoites to move forward (24). In contrast, in ookinetes,

individual depletion or inhibition of CDPK1 and CDPK4 does not affect motility in vitro and only
simultaneous loss significantly reduces ookinete speed (6). The implication is that each kinase can
fully compensate for the other during ookinete traversal (6). As shown previously, ookinete
motility and traversal through the midgut epithelium relies more heavily on CDPK3 (11).
We were surprised to find that, despite the loss of continuous movement, sporozoites
depleted of CDPK1 or CDPK5 maintained the ability to traverse through cells albeit being
significantly attenuated in invasion. Sporozoites traverse through cells by forming a transient
vacuole without the formation of a tight junction between the sporozoite and hepatocyte
membranes (29). Productive invasion requires the formation of a tight junction and sporozoites are
contained within a parasitophorous vacuole. Since loss of CDPK1 and CDPK5 reduces only
invasion, it implies that residual motility in depleted sporozoites is sufficient for traversal. We
suggest that CDPK1 and CDPK5 could regulate the formation of the tight junction or another
process specific to the form of cell entry that is accompanied by the formation of a permanent
vacuole.
Optimal invasion by sporozoites requires a network of CDPKs – CDPK1, CDPK4 and
CDPK5, as shown here, and CDPK6 as shown previously (12). We posit that, in vivo, reduced
motility that results from inhibition or loss of CDPK1, CDPK4 or CDPK5 will severely impair
cell entry by sporozoites, thereby attenuating hepatocyte infection. In contrast, during invasion by
asexual stages, the loss of CDPK1 or CDPK4, individually or together, has no significant effect.
The role of CDPK4 in erythrocytic invasion is seen only in the background of reduced PKG
activity (6). CDPK1’s role in invasion is uncovered only in the background of simultaneous
reduction in PKG and CDPK4 activities. It is possible that erythrocytic stages adapt to the loss of
CDPK1 and CDPK4 by upregulating another CDPK member or PKG activity.
We have also determined that CDPK4 and CDPK5 play a role in merosome formation (Fig.
5E and Supplementary Fig. 3B). Although conditional deletion of the CDPK4 gene in sporozoites
(CDPK4 cKO) did not result in a significant decrease in merosome formation (19), its chemical
inhibition did. We consider it unlikely that 1294-mediated reduction in merosomes is due to offtarget effects on PbPKG because 1294’s IC50 against PfPKG is a fold higher than its IC50 for
PfCDPK4 and P. berghei sporozoites carrying a gatekeeper mutation in PbPKG remain sensitive
to 1294 (Supplementary Fig 3A). The lack of merosome reduction in CDPK4 cKO parasites may
be attributed to upregulation of compensatory pathways. To test these models, we wanted to
determine the effect on merosome formation of rapid reduction in CDPK4 protein. We were unable
to do so because CDPK4-aid-HA sporozoites are not produced in sufficient numbers for robust
merosome assays. Further studies using alternative methods for depleting CDPK4 exclusively in
liver stages and compounds with greater specificity for CDPK4 will address this issue.

Immunofluorescence assays for protein detection in sporozoites, liver stages and merosomes.
Primary antibodies used were: anti-HA (Biolegend, 1:200 -1:400), anti-PKG (1:1000 (19)), antiCS (3D11, 1 µg/mL), anti-HSP70 (2E4, 1.0 µg/mL (31)), anti-Exp1 (1:1000, kind gift of Dr.
Volker Heussler) and anti-MSP1 (1:400, kind gift of Dr. Anthony Holder). Secondary antibodies
(anti-mouse Alexa488, anti- rabbit Alexa594 and anti-chicken Alexa 594, Molecular Probes) were
used at a dilution of 1:3000.
Sporozoites (0.5-1 x 106) were purified as previously described(32), air-dried at room temperature
on poly L-lysine coated glass slides. They were fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min at RT, permeabilized
with 0.5% TritonX-100 for 15min at RT before blocking with 3% BSA in PBS for 1h. Primary
antibodies diluted in blocking solution were added at the appropriate dilutions and incubated either
for 1h at RT or overnight for 4°C. Secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were
incubated for 1h at RT. Washes with PBS were performed after incubation with each antibody.
Protein expression in liver stages was examined by infecting HepG2 cells, at 70% confluency,
with sporozoites (2x104 – 4 x104). At the appropriate time post-infection, cells were fixed in 4%
PFA for 20 min, permeabilized with cold methanol for 15min and blocked in 3% BSA/ PBS for 1
h. For MSP1 staining, cells were permeablized with 0.1% TritonX-100. Primary antibodies diluted
in blocking solution were added at the appropriate dilutions and incubated either for 1 h at RT or
overnight for 4°C. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS. Secondary antibodies diluted in blocking
solution were added at the appropriate dilutions and incubated for 1 h at RT.
Protein expression in merosomes was examined by infecting HepG2 cells, at 70% confluency,
with sporozoites (8x104 – 10 x104). Medium was replaced every 12h. Detached cell-containing
cell culture supernatant was collected at 65 – 67h p.i. and treated with either IAA (500 µM) or

Motility Assays. Sporozoites dissected in DMEM (1x104) were incubated at RT for 90 min with
either IAA (500 µM) or vehicle (1% ethanol), in a volume of 25 µL. After addition of equal volume
of 6% BSA, they were transferred to a 96-well plate with an optical bottom and centrifuged for 3
min at 4°C. Sporozoites were filmed on a Nikon A1R laserscanning confocal microscope using a
20X/NA0.75 objective at 37°C. Movies were recorded over 90 frames at 1 Hz. Image acquisition
and analysis was performed using NIS Elements software from Nikon. Fluorescence intensity

Sporozoite Invasion Assays. Sporozoites (4 x104/well), in plain DMEM medium, were treated with
either IAA (500 µM) or vehicle (1% ethanol) in a volume of 75 µL. After incubation for 90 min
at RT, 75 µL of 2% BSA in DMEM was added along with either IAA (500 µM) or vehicle (1%
ethanol). Sporozoites (150 µL/ well) were added to confluent HepG2 cells plated in 8-chamber
LabTek slides. Invasion assays were performed as previously described (33). Briefly, 90 min after
sporozoite addition, cells were fixed with 4% PFA, blocked with 3% BSA in PBS and incubated
with 3D11 (1µg/ mL) for 1h at RT. After washes with PBS, cells were incubated with anti-mouse
Alexa594 (1:3000) for 1h at RT. Cells were permeablized with cold methanol for 15 min, blocked
and incubated with 3D11. After washes, cells were incubated with anti-mouse Alexa488 (1:3000)
for 1h at RT. The number of sporozoites that became intracellular were determined by calculating

Images were captured using a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal microscope using 60X/NA1.4
oil objective. Image deconvolution was performed using the Nikon NIS Elements Advanced
Research software. For measuring the diameter of liver stages, images were taken at random using
a 100x objective on an Olympus BX61 microscope. The area of a region-of-interest was measured
using Olympus CellSens software.
Western blot analysis for protein detection. Sporozoites (0.5x106 CDPK1-aid-HA/ treatment and
5x106 CDPK5-aid-HA/ treatment) were lyzed in Laemlii buffer in the presence of protease
inhibitor. Protein lysates were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF
membrane using standard wet transfer. The membrane was blocked in 3% BSA in PBS containing
0.1% Tween20. Anti-HA (Biolegend, 1:1000) and anti-GFP (a kind gift of Dr. Conrad Beckers,
1:1000) antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies conjugated to Horse
Radish Peroxidase (GE HealthSciences) were incubated for 1 h at RT. The membrane was washed
(3 x15 min) after primary and secondary antibodies in PBS containing 0.1% Tween20. Membrane

Sporozoite Infection Assays. Sporozoites, pre-treated with IAA (500 µM), vehicle (1% ethanol),
1294 (2 µM) and zaprinast (50 µM), were added to HepG2 cells, for a final volume of 200 µL.
Sporozoite-containing medium was replaced with complete DMEM at 2 h p.i. and 24 h p.i. Cells
were fixed with 4% PFA at 48 h p.i., permeablized with cold methanol for 15 min, blocked for 1
h with 3% BSA in PBS before incubation with the anti-HSP70 and anti-mouse Alexa488
antibodies as described above. The number of liver stages was determined through microscopic
examination.
Liver stage development. Sporozoites (2 - 4 x104/well), in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
were added to HepG2 cells plated in 8-chamber LabTek slides. To determine its effect on liver
stage development, IAA or vehicle was added to infected HepG2 cells 3 h p.i.. Medium was
replaced at 14 h p.i. and cells fixed for immunofluorescence analysis using anti-HSP70 as
described above.
Merosome formation. Sporozoites (8 - 10 x104/well) were added to sub-confluent HepG2 cells
plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Medium was replaced every 12 h. To determine its
effect on the development and release of merosomes, IAA was added to infected HepG2 cells 48
h p.i.. The number of merosomes present in the medium was quantified in a hemocytometer at 65
– 67 h p.i..
In vivo infections. Merosomes were treated with IAA (500 µM) or vehicle (1% ethanol) for 90 min
at RT in DMEM. Following treatment, they were injected intravenously into Swiss-Webster
female mice (4-5 mice/group, 6-8 weeks) either immediately (200 intact merosomes/mouse) or
after passaging 10 times through a 23G needle (5000 ruptured merosomes/mouse) as previously
described (34). Blood was collected from mice 24 h p.i. and analyzed by flow cytometry for the
number of GFP-positive events as previously described (35). A total of 1x105 events was counted
per sample. Parasitemia was confirmed through daily microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained
blood smears.

Figure 1. Spatial and temporal localization of CDPK1 and CDPK5 during the preerythrocytic cycle of P. berghei. A) Representative images of CDPK1 localization in preerythrocytic stages of CDPK1-aid-HA parasites was determined using anti-HA or anti-P.
falciparum CDPK1 (PfCDPK1) antibodies. Sporozoites were co-stained with CS and liver stages
with either Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) or cGMP dependent protein kinase (PbPKG). CDPK1
was present only in sporozoites B) Representative images of CDPK5 localization in preerythrocytic stages of CDPK5-aid-HA parasites determined using an anti-HA antibody. CDPK5
was present in all sporozoites and in a subset of mature liver stages (65 h p.i.). Its expression was
undetectable in early liver stages (24 h p.i.). C) Diameter of individual CDPK5-aid-HA liver stages
(µM + SEM), that either displayed staining with anti-HA antibody at 65h p.i. (+) or not (-) was
determined. Data were analyzed using an unpaired t-test, **** P value < 0.0001.
Figure 2. CDPK5 and PKG are present in the periphery of merosomes. Representative
deconvolved images and optical sections of immunostained CDPK5-aid-HA merosomes.
Figure 3. PbPKG is associated with the parasitophorous vacuole membrane of liver stages.
Representative images of PbPKG’s spatial expression in liver stages of P. berghei parasites
expressing luciferase (PbLuc). Exp1 is a resident protein of the parasitophorous vacuole
membrane, HSP70 is a cytoplasmic protein and Merozoite Surface Protein (MSP1) is a marker of
the parasite plasma membrane.
Figure 4. Conditional degradation of AID-tagged proteins is efficient in pre-erythrocytic
stages. A) Western blot analysis of protein lysates from CDPK1-aid-HA and CDPK5-aid-HA
sporozoites treated with IAA or vehicle. CDPK1-aid-HA and CDPK5-aid-HA were detected using
an anti-HA antibody. GFP was used as a loading control. CDPK1-aid-HA and CDPK5-aid-HA
have predicted molecular weights of approximately 90 kDa. B) Depletion of CDPK5-aid-HA
protein in merosomes was examined using immunofluorescence. Representative images of IAAor vehicle-treated merosomes stained with an anti-HA antibody. Parasite nuclei were visualized
using DAPI. C) Effects of IAA treatment on Ostir1 pre-erythrocytic stages were examined by
quantifying sporozoite invasion of HepG2 cells, the number of liver stages detected at 48 h p.i.
and the number of merosomes released into the media at 66-70h p.i., in the presence or absence of
IAA. Results shown are average of 2-4 experiments with 3 technical replicates (+ SEM),
normalized to vehicle-treated samples for each assay. Data were analyzed using an unpaired t-test,
not significant (n.s.) P value > 0.05.
Figure 5. CDPKs have partially overlapping but distinct roles during the pre-erythrocytic

Interaction between CDPK1, CDPK4 and PKG in sporozoites was studied by determining the
number of liver stages formed by sporozoites in which CDPK1 and CDPK4 functions are inhibited,
when PKG is activated. Results shown are average of 3 experiments with 3 technical replicates (+
SEM), normalized to vehicle-treated samples. D) Interaction between CDPK5, CDPK4 and PKG
in sporozoites was studied by determining the number of liver stages formed by sporozoites in
which CDPK5 and CDPK4 functions are inhibited, in the presence of increased cGMP. Results
shown are average of 3 experiments with 3 technical replicates (+ SEM), normalized to vehicletreated samples for each assay. E) Merosome formation and release was determined by quantifying
the number of merosomes present in media of infected cells at 65-67 h p.i. Results shown are
average of 2 experiments with CDPK1-aid-HA and 3 experiments with CDPK5-aid-HA, with 3
technical replicates (+ SEM), normalized to vehicle-treated samples. F) Infectivity of CDPK5-aidHA merosomes and hepatic merozoites was quantified by FACS detection of GFP-positive events
in 100,000 events at 24 h p.i. (iRBCs + SEM). The experiment was performed 4 times with intact
merosomes (5 mice/each group/experiment), and 2 times with ruptured merosomes (4-5 mice/each
group/experiment). Data were analyzed using an unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s
multiple comparisons test, non-significant (n.s.) P > 0.05, * P value < 0.05, ** P value < 0.005,

hepatocytes. A) Off-target inhibition of PbPKG by 1294 in sporozoites was interrogated using
parasites expressing either HA-tagged wild-type PKG (PKG-HA) or its gatekeeper mutant (T619QHA). Liver stages were quantified at 48 h p.i. The number of liver stages (+ SD) formed in each
condition was normalized to vehicle-treated controls. The experiment was performed once with 4
technical replicates. B) Dose-dependent inhibition of merosome formation by 1294. Merosomes
and detached cells were quantified at 65-68h p.i. with PbLuc sporozoites. Compound was added
to infected HepG2 cultures at 48 h p.i. and refreshed every 12 h. The number of
merosomes/detached cells (+ SEM) formed in each condition was normalized to vehicle-treated
controls. The experiment was performed twice with technical triplicates. C) Growth rate of
CDPK5-aid-HA parasites in erythrocytes. Parasitemias (+ SD) of mice infected with vehicle- or
IAA-treated CDPK5-aid-HA merosomes were determined daily. Data are from a representative
experiment (5 mice/group). Data were analyzed using an unpaired t-test, non-significant (n.s.) P >
0.05, * P value < 0.05.
