ABSTRACT

37

The recent re-emergence of yellow fever virus (YFV) in Brazil has raised serious concerns due to the

38

virus’ rapid dissemination in the southeastern region. To better understand YFV genetic diversity and

39

dynamics during the recent outbreak in southeastern Brazil we generated 18 complete and near-

40

complete genomes from the peak of the epidemic curve from non-human primates (NHPs) and human

41

infected cases across Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro states. Genomic sequencing of 18 YFV

42

genomes revealed the timing, source and likely routes of yellow fever virus transmission and

43

dispersion during the one of the largest outbreaks ever registered in Brazil. We showed that the recent

44

YFV epidemic spillover southwards several times from Minas Gerais to Espírito Santo and Rio de

45

Janeiro states in 2016 to 2019. The quick production and analysis of data from portable sequencing

46

could identify the corridor of spread of YFV. These findings reinforce that real-time and continued

47

genomic surveillance strategies can assist in the monitoring and public health responses of arbovirus

48

epidemics.

IMPORTANCE

51

Arbovirus infections in Brazil including Yellow Fever, Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya result in

52

considerable morbidity and mortality and are pressing public health concerns. However, our

53

understanding of these outbreaks is hampered by limited availability of real time genomic data. In

54

this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and spatial distribution of YFV during the current

55

outbreak in southeastern Brazil. To gain insights into the routes of YFV introduction and dispersion,

56

we tracked the virus by sequencing YFV genomes sampled from non-human primates and infected

57

patients from the southeastern region. Our study provides an understanding of how YFV initiates

58

transmission in new Brazilian regions and illustrates that near-real time genomics in the field can

59

augment traditional approaches to infectious disease surveillance and control.

INTRODUCTION

62

Yellow fever (YF) is a vector-borne disease that is endemic in tropical areas of Africa and South

63

America (1). The aetiologic agent is the yellow fever virus (YFV), a single-stranded positive sense,

64

RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family (2). YFV diversity can be classified into four distinct

65

genotypes, which have been named based on their geographical distribution: East African, West

66

African, South American I, and South American II genotypes (3-6).

67

In the Americas, YFV transmission can occur via two main epidemiological transmission

68

cycles: the sylvatic (or jungle) and the urban (domestic) cycles. In the sylvatic cycle non-human

69

primates (NHPs) are infected through the bite of mosquito vectors such as Haemagogus spp. and

70

Sabethes spp. (7, 8). However, in the urban cycle, humans can be infected by Aedes spp. mosquitoes

71

biting (9). YFV infection in humans shows a wide spectrum of disease severity including

72

asymptomatic infection, mild illness with dengue-like symptoms, including fever, nausea, vomiting

73

and fatigue, and severe disease, including fever with jaundice or hemorrhage and death (10).

74

While eradication is not feasible due to the wildlife reservoir system, large-scale vaccination

75

coverage provides considerable protection against the re-urbanization of YFV transmission (11).

76

However, despite the availability of effective vaccines, YF remains an important public health issue

77

in Africa and South America. In late 2016, a severe re-emergence of YFV epidemic has been reported

78

in southeastern Brazil. The epidemic has evolved to become the largest observed in the country in

decades, reaching areas close to the Atlantic rainforest (11, 12). YFV 2016-2017 epidemic in Brazil

80

accounted for 1,412 epizootics, 777 YF human confirmed cases, most of which in southeast Brazil

81

(Minas Gerais n=465; Sao Paulo n=22, Rio de Janeiro n=25; Espírito Santo n=252 confirmed cases),

82

and 261 human deaths (13). Following this epidemic new cases were reported between 2017-2018

83

and in that period 864 epizootics, 1,376 YF human confirmed cases and 483 human deaths were

84

registered, with the southern states among the most affected by the YFV epidemic (Minas Gerais

85

n=532; Sao Paulo n=377, Rio de Janeiro n=186; Espírito Santo n=6 confirmed cases) (14). The

86

epidemic persisted in 2018-2019 and accounted for 1,883 NHP notified cases (n=20 confirmed NHP

87

cases) and 12 human confirmed cases, including 5 human deaths from the state of São Paulo. Most

88

of the confirmed epizootic cases was registered in the southeastern states (95%) (São Paulo (n=10);

89

Rio de Janeiro (n=8) and Minas Gerais (n=1) (13-15).

90

Although there is currently no evidence that urban transmission has occurred, the outbreak affected

91

areas highly infested by Ae. aegypti and Ae. Albopictus where yellow fever vaccination was recently

92

introduced in routinely of immunization program. This condition or behavior raises concern that, for

93

the first time in decades, there might be high risk of YFV urban transmission in Brazil (16). New

94

surveillance and analytical approaches are therefore needed to monitor this threat in real time.

95

Even so, there is limited information from genomic surveillance studies about the genomic

96

epidemiology and the dissemination dynamics of 2016-2019 YFV circulating in Southeast Brazil.

97

Previous studies have shown the spatial and evolutionary dynamics of the current YFV outbreak in

98

different southeastern states, (11) and shed light regarding the possible co-circulation of distinct YFV

99

lineages (17). Nevertheless, there is still limited information about the genomic epidemiology of YFV

100

circulating in Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro states from genomic surveillance studies, impairs our

101

understanding of the virus re-introduction, establishment and dissemination in those regions.

102

Thus, to better understand the re-emergence of the recent YFV epidemic in those regions, we analyzed

103

a larger and updated dataset of recently released data of the YFV 2016-2019 epidemic in Brazil,

RESULTS

108

Molecular diagnostics and genome sequencing from clinical samples

109

Liver, spleen, kidney and blood samples from 14 NHPs and liver and serum samples from 4 human

110

infected cases collected in Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo states, Southeast Brazil, between January

111

2017 and April 2018, were tested for YFV RNA using the RT-qPCR assay (18, 19) at the Flavivirus

112

Laboratory at FIOCRUZ Rio de Janeiro (LABFLA/FIOCRUZ).

113

Most confirmed cases in NHPs were from animals of the Alouatta genus (42.9%; 6 of 14), followed

114

by Callithrix (35.7%; 5 of 14), Sapajus (7.1%; 1 of 14) and Leontopithecus rosalia (14.3%; 2 of 14).

115

PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were on average 12.23 (range: 7.2 to 22.4) (Table 1).

116

To investigate the source and transmission of YFV and the genetic diversity of the virus circulating

117

in human and NHPs across Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo states, we used the MinION handheld

118

nanopore sequencer to generate 18 complete and near complete genomic sequences (average

119

coverage = 89.9%; Table 2) using a previously described MinION sequencing protocol (11, 20).

120

New sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers: MK882599-

121

MK882604; MK882607-MK882613; MK882615; MK882617-MK882619; MK882621. YF samples

122

sequenced in this study were geographically widespread across 6 municipalities of Rio de Janeiro and

123

7 municipalities of Espírito Santo, (Figure 1A).

124

Figure 1 panel B shows the number of YFV confirmed cases in the Espirito Santo and Rio de Janeiro

125

states respectively. Epidemiological data revealed two distinct YFV epidemic waves. The first

126

epidemic wave (wave 1) is represented by the YFV cases mainly registered in the Espírito Santo state,

127

during the first semester of 2017 (January to April, n= 252 cases), although some sporadic cases were

128

reported in the following year (Figure 1B). The second wave (wave 2), in turn, is represented by YFV

129

cases registered in Rio de Janeiro state during first semester of 2018 (February to May; n=220 cases)

130

(Figure 1B). Although majority of cases in Rio de Janeiro occurred between February and March

131

2018, we can see that the re-emergence of YFV in that state was detected around March 2017, during

132

epidemic wave 1 that mainly affected Espírito Santo state.

133
134

Genetic history of YFV in Southeastern Brazil

135

To investigate the phylogenetic relationship of YFV strains circulating in the southeastern states of

136

Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro we estimated a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree for a

137

dataset of 181 reference sequences comprising the four YFV lineages. Our ML phylogeny revealed

138

that, as suspected, the newly generated YFV sequences belong to the South American I (SAI) lineage

139

with high statistical support (bootstrap = 100%), clustering with other Brazilian isolates from the

140

2016-2019 epidemic (Supplementary Figure 1).

141

Subsequently, to investigate the dynamic of the YFV infection within the Southeast region, genetic

142

analyses were conducted on a second dataset (dataset 2, n = 137), including recently published

143

sequences from the YFV 2016-2019 epidemic in Brazil, belonging to the SA1 lineage. The time-scale

144

of our phylogenetic estimates was consistent with recently studies (17, 21, 22) and confirmed the

145

presence of two distinct lineages circulating in the current YFV epidemic, named hereafter as SA1

146

lineage 1 and SA1 lineage 2 (Figure 2). The SA1 lineage 1 comprises sequences from the northern

147

and eastern regions of Minas Gerais, Bahia, Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro states and the time of

148

the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of this lineage was dated back to September 2016 (95%

149

BCI: July to November 2016). Meanwhile the SA1 lineage 2 comprises sequences from the southern

150

municipalities of Minas Gerais state and sequences from the southeastern state of Sao Paulo and the

151

TMRCA of this lineage was dated back around July 2016 (95% BCI: June to December 2016) (Fig.

152

2). Moreover, our time-scaled phylogeny showed that the sequences generated in this study clustered

153

together with high support (pp=90 %) within SA1 lineage 1 (Figure 2).

154

In order to understand the transmission and the spatio-temporal evolution of the SA1 lineage 1,

155

subsequently we analysed a subset of 81 (Dataset 3) sequences from this lineage (Supplementary

156

figure 2). We performed a regression of genetic divergence from root to tip against sampling dates

157

that confirmed sufficient temporal signal (r2=0.70) in this dataset. A time-scaled phylogenetic

158

analysis using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework (23) was then performed

159

to investigate the time of introduction of the YFV into the Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro states

160

(Figure 3 A). Figure 3A showed a zoom of our Bayesian time-scaled phylogeny highlighting the

161

SA1 lineage 1 comprising the 2017-2019 YFV strains from Minas Gerais, Bahia, Espírito Santo and

162

Rio de Janeiro states. Our analysis showed that samples from Espírito Santo were intermixed with

163

sequences from Rio de Janeiro. This suggests that the YFV epidemic in Espírito Santo and Rio de

164

Janeiro was not caused by a single introduction event, as observed in Sao Paulo (17, 21), but resulted

165

from multiples introduction over time.

166

We next used a continuous diffusion model to investigate how the SA1 lineage 1 has been spreading

167

over space and time. We found evidence that YFV disseminated through southeastern Brazilian states

168

using two distinct paths with an average dispersal rate of 0.12 km/day (95% HPD: 0.09 – 0.14

169

km/day). From the northern region of Minas Gerais state, YFV spread to the south region of Bahia

170

state around January 2017 (95% BCI: December 2016 to February 2017) (Figure 3), and from the

171

eastern region of Minas Gerais state YFV moved towards Espírito Santo state, (pp=0.99) with

172

introductions estimated around January 2017 (95% BCI: November 2016 to January 2017) (Figure

173

3 Panels A, B). Since its introduction in the Espírito Santo state, the virus widespread through the

174

neighboring state (Figure 3). Our analyses revealed that YFV was likely introduced in Rio de Janeiro

175

state several times between January (95% BCI: December 2016 to February 2017) and March 2017

176

(February 2017 to May 2017), spreading southward from the border with Espírito Santo state and

177

reaching Angra dos Reis municipality, which is located in the southern region of Rio de Janeiro. Our

178

data further suggests that after its first introduction in Rio de Janeiro the virus persisted until 2019,

179

as indicated by the isolate MK533792 sampled, in the municipality of Casimiro de Abreu, in January

180

2019 (12) (Figure 3 Panel A).

DISCUSSION

183

In this study, we generated and analysed 18 new YFV complete and near-complete genomic

184

sequences from samples from humans and non-human primates collected in several municipalities in

185

Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro states, in 2017-2018.

186

Despite previous studies have already shown the spatial and evolutionary dynamics of the current

187

YFV outbreak in Brazil (11, 12, 17, 21), the shortage of genomic data from Espirito Santo and Rio

188

de Janeiro states hampered the possibility of shed light on the re-emergence, establishment and the

189

corridor of spread of the YFV transmission in those regions.

190

The generated genomic data provides a more detailed understanding of the introduction and

191

progression of YFV SA1 lineage 1 and reveals the timing, source and likely routes of yellow fever

192

virus transmission and dispersion during the largest outbreak in Brazil in decades.

193

According to the Ministry of Health epidemiological bulletin, the YFV re-emergence in the states of

194

Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro was confirmed in these states in January and February 2017

195

respectively (13-15).

196

Our estimates indicated that YFV strains from the epidemic first emerged in Espírito Santo

197

state from Minas Gerais around January 2017 (95% BCI: November 2016 to January 2017), which is

198

consistent with epidemiological data (13-15). From the state of Espírito Santo, YFV spread

199

southwards to the great metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro state. Moreover, our data indicated that

200

the circulation of YFV in Rio de Janeiro may have resulted from multiple and independent

201

introductions events from Espírito Santo state, highlighting a complex dispersion dynamic of the

202

current YFV outbreak in Brazil occurred between January (95% BCI: December 2016 to February

203

2017) and March 2017 (February 2017 to May 2017). Our data further suggest that after its first

204

introduction in Rio de Janeiro the virus persisted until 2019, as indicated by the isolate MK533792

205

sampled in the municipality of Casimiro de Abreu in January 2019 (12). This estimation suggests

206

the YFV have persisted in Rio de Janeiro state for approximately 24 months. This suggest that Rio de

207

Janeiro state possesses the ecological conditions to maintain YFV outside the period of transmission

208

(Dec to May) (12). Ultimately, given the abundance of sylvatic competent vectors (12) and non-

209

human primates (21, 22), this data could indicate that there is some potential for the establishment of

210

an enzootic transmission cycle of yellow fever in Mata Atlantica.

211

Epidemiological data also indicated two distinct YFV epidemic waves (13, 14). The first epidemic

212

wave is represented by the YFV cases mainly registered in Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo state

213

during the first semester of 2017, while the second wave is represented by the YFV cases registered

214

in Rio de Janeiro state during first semester of 2018. Transmission of YFV in areas with susceptible

215

NHPs species typically occurs in time periods characterized by environmental conditions suitable to

216

support higher mosquito abundance (12, 24).

217

As previously suggested (17), we found evidence regarding the circulation of two distinct YFV

218

lineage, that might have been spread to distinct evolutionary and diffusion rates. Using YFV genetic

219

data, we estimate that the YFV SA1 lineage 1 spread at rate of 0.12 km/day (95% HPD: 0.09 – 0.14

220

km/day), that is slightly lower than previously estimates (11, 17). The substantial difference between

221

previously estimates (11, 17) and ours might reflect the larger dataset analyzed in this study, that

222

might explain differences in the rate of YFV spread among different areas as well as different lineage.

223

These findings reinforce that continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to assist

224

in the monitoring and understanding of arbovirus epidemics, which might help to attenuate public

225

health impact of infectious diseases.

226

In this study we also demonstrate that by analyzing heterochronous datasets with samples

227

collected in different time points and/or locations, phylodynamics becomes a powerful tool to prevent

228

and identify the viral lineage movement, describe trends in epidemic spread and to improve

229

intervention strategies (11, 25, 26).

230

Continued surveillance in human and non-human primates (NHP) in non-epidemic periods in the

231

southeast region will be important in order to quantify the risk of new outbreaks and the establishment

232

of new YFV transmission cycles in the region. In conclusion, our study shows that genomic data

Sample collection

239

Human and non-human primate samples were collected, under the guidelines of a national strategy

240

of YF surveillance, for molecular diagnostics by the Flavivirus Laboratory (LABFLA) at Oswaldo

241

Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which is a Brazilian Ministry of Health Regional

242

Reference Laboratory for arboviruses. The majority of samples were linked to a digital record that

243

collated epidemiological and clinical data such as date of sample collection, municipality of

244

residence, neighborhood of residence, demographic characteristics (age and sex) and date of onset of

245

clinical symptoms.

cDNA synthesis and whole genome nanopore sequencing

260

Sequencing was attempted on the 18 selected RT-PCR positive samples regardless of Ct value as

261

previously described (11, 20, 26). All positive samples were submitted to a cDNA synthesis protocol

262

(11, 20) using ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. Then, a multiplex tiling PCR was

263

attempted using the previously published YFV primer scheme and 30 cycles of PCR using Q5 High-

Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) as previously described (20). Amplicons were purified using 1x

AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter) and cleaned-up PCR products concentrations were measured

266

using Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit on a Qubit 3.0 fluorimeter (ThermoFisher). DNA library

267

preparation was performed using the Ligation Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and

268

the Native Barcoding Kit (NBD103, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Sequencing

269

library was generated from the barcoded products using the Genomic DNA Sequencing Kit SQK-

270

MAP007/SQK-LSK208 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Sequencing library was loaded onto a

271

R9.4 flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies).

272
273

Generation of consensus sequences

274

Consensus sequences for each barcoded sample were generated following a previously published

275

approach (20). Briefly, raw files were basecalled using Albacore, demultiplexed and trimmed using

276

Porechop, and then mapped with bwa to a reference genome (GenBank accession number JF912190).

277

Nanopolish variant calling was applied to the assembly to detect single nucleotide variants to the

278

reference genome. Consensus sequences were generated; non-overlapped primer binding sites, and

279

sites for which coverage was <20X were replaced with ambiguity code N. Sequencing statistics can

280

be found in Table 1. Accession numbers of newly generated sequences are: MK882599-MK882604;

281

MK882607-MK882613; MK882615; MK882617-MK882619; MK882621.

Collation of YFV complete genome datasets

286

Genotyping was first conducted using the phylogenetic Yellow fever typing tool available at

287

http://www.krisp.org.za/tools.php. The genome sequences generated here were combined with a

288

dataset comprising previously published genomes from the 2016-2019 YFV epidemic in Brazil

289

(11,12, 17, 21, 22). Two complete or near-complete YFV genome datasets were generated. Dataset 1

290

(n = 199) comprised the data reported in this study (n = 18) plus (n = 181) complete or almost

291

complete YFV genomic sequences (>10,000 bp), retrieved from NCBI in June 2019 and covering all

292

four existing genotypes. Subsequently, to investigate the dynamic of the YFV infection within the

293

Southeast region, genetic analyses were conducted on a smaller dataset (dataset 2) including a larger

294

and updated dataset of recently released data of the YFV 2016-2019 epidemic in Brazil belonging to

295

the SA1 lineage (n = 137). Thus, to understand the transmission and the spatio-temporal evolution of

296

the YFV SA1 lineage 1, from this dataset, we generated a subset (dataset 3) that included all identified

297

sequences from that lineage (n = 81). Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were estimated

298

using RAxML (27) under a GTR + 4 nucleotide substitution model. Statistical support for

299

phylogenetic nodes was estimated using a ML bootstrap approach with 1000 replicates.

300

In order to investigate the temporal signal in our YFV datasets 2 and 3 we regressed root-to-tip genetic

301

distances from this ML tree against sample collection dates using TempEst v 1.5.1

302

(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk) (28).

303
304

Dated phylogenetics

305

To estimate time-calibrated phylogenies dated from time-stamped genome data, we conducted

306

phylogenetic analysis using a Bayesian software package (23). Here we used the GTR + 4 nucleotide

307

substitution model and Bayesian Skygrid tree prior (29) with an uncorrelated relaxed clock with a

308

lognormal distribution (30). Analyses were run in duplicate in BEASTv.1.10.4 (23) for 50 million

309

MCMC steps, sampling parameters and trees every 5000th step. A non-informative continuous time

310

Markov chain reference prior on the molecular clock rate was used (31). Convergence of MCMC

chains was checked using Tracer v.1.7.1 (32). Maximum clade trees were summarized using

312

TreeAnnotator after discarding 10% as burn-in.

313
314

Phylogeographic analyses

315

To investigate the spread of YFV in Southeast Brazil, we analysed in more detail the SA1 Lineage 1

316

that includes the n=81 sequences (Figure 2). We used a skygrid coalescent tree prior (33) and a

317

continuous phylogeographic model that uses a relaxed random walk to model the spatial diffusion of

318

lineages. Dispersal velocity variation among lineages was modelled using a Cauchy distribution (34,

319

35). Virus diffusion through time and space was summarized using 1000 phylogenies sampled at

320

regular intervals from the posterior distribution (after exclusion of burn-in). Sampling location of

321

each geo-referenced YFV sequences from Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro state are listed in

322

Supplementary table 1. Georeferenced and time-stamped sequences were analysed in BEAST

323

v.1.10.4 (23) using the BEAGLE library (36) to enhance computational speed.
