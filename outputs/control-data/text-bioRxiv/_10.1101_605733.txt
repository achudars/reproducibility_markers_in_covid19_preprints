Abstract

16

Sustained perturbations are relevant for environmental biotechnology as they can lead systems to

17

alternative stable states that may not be reversible. Studies assessing these concerns are scarce as

18

robust replication is required. Here, we tested the effect of sustained organic loading variations (food-

19

to-biomass ratio, F:M; carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, C:N) on both structure and function of activated

20

sludge bacterial communities, focusing on nitrification and nitrifiers. Two sets of replicate 5-liter

21

sequencing batch reactors were operated at two different, low (n=4) and high (n=3), F:M (0.19-0.36

22

mgCOD/mgTSS/d) and C:N (3.5-6.3 mgCOD/mgTKN) conditions for a period of 74 days, following

23

53 days of sludge acclimation. The inoculum was taken from a full-scale treatment plant. Resilience

24

was tested during the last 14 days by operating all seven reactors at low F:M-C:N. Samples were

25

analyzed using metagenomics, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and effluent characterization.

26

High F:M-C:N reactors exhibited different ecosystem functions and nitrifier abundance compared to

27

the ones at low F:M-C:N. Perturbed high F:M-C:N reactors displayed quantifiable and initially

28

variable functional resistance. Stable nitrite accumulation (77%) was achieved through high F:M-C:N

29

loading with concurrent suppression of Nitrospira, revealing a new partial nitrification strategy for

30

nitritation-denitritation systems. Subsequently, only two of the three reactors experiencing a switch

31

back from high to low F:M-C:N recovered the nitrification function, with an increase in Nitrobacter

32

(r-strategist) abundance as the predominant NOB replacing the niche initially occupied by Nitrospira

33

(K-strategist). Overall, the AOB community was more diverse and resilient than the NOB community.

34

We showed that functional resistance and resilience can vary across replicate reactors in a closed

35

system, and that nitrification resilience need not coincide with a return to the initial nitrifying

36

community structure.

1. Introduction

38

Improving stability and optimizing performance of wastewater treatment processes are central

39

tenets of environmental engineering and biotechnology, to help achieve the sustainable development

40

goal of guaranteeing availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for everyone

41

[1]. In ecology, perturbations or disturbances are believed to have direct effects on the stability of

42

ecosystems by altering community structure and function (Table 1) [2]. For engineered systems like

43

activated sludge bioreactors, it is important to identify the effect of different disturbances on the

44

microbial community structure so as to relate them to changes in process performance [3]. However,

45

disturbance is also deemed to affect underlying mechanisms of community assembly [4] which, if

46

predominantly stochastic, could drive microbial communities to divergent trajectories in terms of

47

composition and function [5]. Therefore, robust replication is required to properly assess the effect of

48

perturbations in the stability of sludge bioreactors.

49

Sustained perturbations or press disturbances that impose a long-term continuous change of

50

species densities through an alteration of the environment [6, 7], are relevant since they can lead a

51

system to alternative stable states that may or may not be reversible in terms of both community

52

composition and function [8]. Press disturbance studies on wastewater treatment systems often

53

employ harsh perturbations like toxic aromatic pollutants [9] or washout of organisms through sludge

54

discharge [10, 11]. However, alterations in the environment that are not directly detrimental for

55

organisms but still provide opportunities for low abundance members within the community are also

56

considered a disturbance [12]. In bioreactors, a switch in the substrate feeding scheme employed

57

could then elicit changes in community structure and function. Such perturbations can occur in the

58

form of organic shocks within activated sludge [13-15] and anaerobic reactor systems [16, 17]. In

59

wastewater treatment, the food-to-biomass ratio (F:M) or sludge loading rate is an important

60

parameter as it determines the growth type and settleability of sludge microorganisms [18]. Moreover,

61

the F:M is also related to the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) as both depend on the amount of organic

62

carbon in the feed. However, the few studies describing the effect of alterations in F:M on sludge

63

microbial communities often neglect uncontrolled covariations in C:N [19, 20], despite the fact that

64

C:N variations are known to affect nitrification [21]. This is also overlooked in studies where F:M

65

values change through modifications in solids retention time (SRT) [10, 11] and organic carbon

66

loading rate (OLR) [22, 23].

67

Partial nitrification is an important stage in biological nitrogen removal from wastewater via

68

nitritation/anammox [24], for which the accumulation of nitrite is desired by promoting the growth of

69

ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) while suppressing nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) [25]. Different

70

strategies have been employed towards this goal, like varying temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO),

71

pH, SRT, and substrate concentrations [26]. Influent manipulation in particular has been reported to

72

yield contrasting results in terms of C:N [27]. Low influent C:N values (2-3 mg COD/mg TN) have

73

been shown to prevent [28], but also promote [29-31] nitrite accumulation in different sludge systems.

74

Other studies have reported nitrite accumulation at high (10 mg COD/mg NH4+-N) [32] and also

75

fluctuating influent C:N values (2.5-8 mg COD/mg NH4+-N) [33, 34]. Additionally, although

76

adjustments in C:N also impact F:M values by altering the available carbon for heterotrophic growth,

77

none of these studies accounted for covariations in F:M, and hence there is a knowledge gap about

78

system performance when both factors are controlled simultaneously. For better nitrite accumulation

79

strategies, more research is needed to understand the effect of variations in influent C:N together with

80

controlled variations of other important operational parameters like F:M and SRT.

81

The aim of this work was to test the effect of a sustained perturbation (press disturbance) of

82

doubling F:M and C:N values in a set of replicated lab-scale bioreactors after an acclimation period,

83

with controlled parameters to avoid loose covariations. The focus was on the nitrification function and

84

the nitrifying microbial community. Dynamics in community function were monitored throughout the

85

study by periodic analysis of reactor effluent, as well as detailed temporal studies of reactor cycles at

86

seven different time points. Nitrite accumulation was also tracked due to its relevance for practical

87

applications. Changes in composition of nitrifying organisms were assessed by metagenomics and

88

16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The resistance of relevant functions and specific nitrifier

89

abundance was evaluated by monitoring their transition to a different steady state after the

perturbation. We further tested resilience by shifting the F:M and C:N back to the original pre-

91

perturbation state.

92

2. Materials and Methods

93

2.1. Experimental design

94

The experiment was conducted using seven 5-liter bioreactors inoculated with activated sludge

95

from a water reclamation plant in Singapore and operated as sequencing batch reactors (SBR) on

96

continuous 12-h cycles with intermittent aeration. Initially, four reactors were acclimated to lab

97

conditions and fed with complex synthetic wastewater for 53 days. The complex synthetic feed was

98

adapted from Hesselmann [35]. At the start of the experiment (d54), the sludge of the acclimation

99

reactors was thoroughly mixed and redistributed across seven reactors. From these, three were

100

randomly selected and designated as high F:M and C:N

reactors, receiving double the carbon

101

substrate in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) amount in its feed as a press disturbance for 60

102

days. The remaining four reactors were operated as before at low F:M and C:N. During the last two

103

weeks of the study (d114-d127), the feed for the high F:M and C:N reactors was adjusted to equal that

104

of low F:M and C:N reactors (Table 2). For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to both F:M and C:N

105

as F:M-C:N. A schematic representation of the experimental design (Fig. S1) and details about sludge

106

inoculum, acclimation phase and complex synthetic wastewater preparation are available as

107

supplementary information.

108

2.2. Operational parameters

109

The reactor temperature was maintained at 30°C and sludge was continuously mixed with a

110

magnetic stirrer. In each cycle, SBR phases were: 5 min feed, 200 min anoxic/anaerobic react, 445

111

min aerobic react, 50 min sludge settle, and 20 min supernatant drain. The DO concentration was

112

controlled at 2 – 6 mg/L during the aerobic phase. The pH ranged from 6 – 9, owing to alkalinity

113

provided in the feed. Two cycles per day corresponded to a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 h.

114

Effluent and influent compositions were measured 2-3 times per week in accordance with Standard

115

Methods [36]. The targets were soluble COD, total alkalinity, and nitrogen species (ammonium,

116

nitrite and nitrate) in the liquid phase using colorimetric tests and ion chromatography. Nitrite

117

accumulation percentage in the effluent was calculated as the ratio of nitrite concentration and the

118

sum of nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Total organic carbon and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) were

119

also measured in the influent. To control the F:M, sludge biomass was measured as total (TSS) and

120

volatile suspended solids (VSS) twice a week, after which sludge wastage was done to target 1500

121

mg/L of TSS. Sludge volume index (SVI) was calculated from the liquid and sludge volumes

122

measured in the reactors after 30 min settling and the TSS values obtained in the same cycle.

123

Microbial community function was also investigated in the form of intensive sampling (every 30 to 60

124

min) over seven 12-h cycle studies conducted throughout the experiment. Detailed equations and

125

explanations for F:M, C:N and SRT calculations, as well as analytical methods, are available as

126

supplementary information.

127

2.3. Bioreactor arrangement

128

Each of the SBRs employed in this study was equipped with: a magnetic stir plate to ensure

129

mixed liquor homogeneity, a pair of EasySense pH and DO probes with their corresponding

130

transmitters (Mettler Toledo), a dedicated air pump, a dedicated feed pump, a solenoid valve for

131

supernatant discharge, and a surrounding water jacket connected to a re-circulating water heater. The

132

different portions of the cycle were controlled by a computer software specifically designed for these

133

reactors (VentureMerger, Singapore).

134

2.4. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reads processing

135

Bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was done in two steps (for details see

136

Supplementary Information). Primer set 341f/785r targeted the V3-V4 variable regions of the 16S

137

rRNA gene [37]. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform (v.3) with 20% PhiX

138

spike-in and at a read-length of 300 bp paired-end. Sequenced sample libraries were processed

139

following the DADA2 bioinformatics pipeline [38] using the version 1.3.3 of the dada2 R-package.

140

DADA2 allows inference of exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) providing several benefits over

141

traditional OTU clustering methods [39]. Illumina sequencing adaptors and PCR primers were

142

trimmed prior to quality filtering. Sequences were truncated after 280 and 255 nucleotides for forward

143

and reverse reads, respectively, length at which average quality dropped below a Phred score of 20.

144

After truncation, reads with expected error rates higher than 3 and 5 for forward and reverse reads

145

were removed. After filtering, error rate learning, ASV inference and denoising, reads were merged

146

with a minimum overlap of 20 bp. Chimeric sequences (0.18% on average) were identified and

147

removed. For a total of 104 samples, 19679 reads were kept on average per sample after processing,

148

representing 49.2% of the average input reads. Taxonomy was assigned using the SILVA database

149

(v.132) [40]. Adequacy of sequencing depth after reads processing was corroborated with rarefaction

150

curves at the ASV level (Fig. S2).

151

2.5. Metagenomics sequencing and reads processing

152

Libraries were sequenced in one lane on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer in rapid mode at a

153

final concentration of 11pM and a read-length of 250 bp paired-end. In total, around 325 million

154

paired-end reads were generated, with 3.4 ± 0.4 million paired-end reads on average per sample (total

155

48 samples). Illumina adaptors, short reads, low quality reads or reads containing any ambiguous

156

bases were removed using cutadapt [41]. High quality reads (91.0 ± 1.4% of the raw reads) were

157

randomly subsampled to an even depth of 4,678,535 for each sample prior to further analysis.

158

Taxonomic assignment of metagenomics reads was done following the method described by Ilott

159

[42]. High quality reads were aligned against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein database (March

160

2016) using DIAMOND v.0.7.10.59 [43] with default parameters. The lowest common ancestor

161

approach implemented in MEGAN Community Edition v.6.5.5 [44] was used to assign taxonomy to

162

the NCBI-NR aligned reads with the following parameters (maxMatches=25, minScore=50,

163

minSupport=20, paired=true). On average, 36.8% of the high-quality reads were assigned to cellular

164

organisms, of which 98.4% were assigned to the bacterial domain. Adequacy of sequencing depth was

165

corroborated with rarefaction curves at the genus taxonomic level (Fig. S2).

3. Results

167

3.1. Dynamics in bioreactor performance

168

During the acclimation phase, the F:M-C:N values were maintained at 0.21 (mg COD/mg

169

TSS/d) and 3.5 (mg COD/mg TKN), respectively (Table 2). Ammonium concentrations in the effluent

170

decreased gradually while nitrate concentrations increased (Fig. 1). Sludge related parameters like

171

settleability (SVI) and biomass fraction (VSS:TSS) varied during this acclimation period (Fig. S3).

172

Most of these variations decreased after 30 d and trends were stable after 45 d.

173

During the perturbation phase of the study (d54 onwards), sludge was wasted more often to

174

better control the TSS and thus the F:M (Fig. S2), which is the reason why the SRT for the low F:M-

175

C:N reactors is lower than during the acclimation phase. The average F:M and C:N values for the low

176

F:M-C:N reactors were similar to those during the acclimation phase (0.19 and 3.5), while the ones

177

for the high F:M-C:N reactors were controlled to be almost double (0.36 and 6.3). As expected

178

(details in supplementary information), controlling for a higher F:M resulted in a lower SRT in

179

reactors subjected to this treatment (Table 2). This period showed a clear distinction between high and

180

low F:M-C:N reactors in terms of nitrification and organic carbon removal, with the high F:M-C:N

181

reactors displaying nitrite accumulation with high NO2--N and COD effluent concentrations (Fig. 1).

182

To ensure that the partial nitrification was due to different F:M-C:N values and not a lack of available

183

dissolved oxygen, we increased the aeration rate from 1 to 4 L min-1 from d97 onwards without

184

observing significant changes in effluent compounds. The last two weeks of the study involved

185

shifting operational parameters in the high F:M-C:N reactors to match those of the low F:M-C:N ones

186

(Table 2). During this period a transition towards recovery of the nitrification function was observed,

187

with high variability of effluent values for NO2--N, NO3--N and COD across reactors (Fig. 1).

188

3.2. Dynamics in nitrification and nitrifiers

189

Nitrite accumulation was found in the effluent of high F:M-C:N reactors, together with a higher

190

residual COD (Fig. 1). The acclimation phase (d1-d53) displayed negligible nitrite accumulation at

191

0.3% (± 1.5%). Low F:M-C:N reactors had zero percent nitrite accumulation after d61 and only 1.1%

192

(± 2.0%) during the first week (d54-d60). Conversely, high F:M-C:N reactors showed an initial

193

transient nitrite accumulation of 18% (± 21%) on d54-d60, which subsequently increased and

194

stabilized at 77% (± 6.0%) during the d61-d113 period. Finally, after shifting from high to low F:M-

195

C:N conditions, nitrite accumulation decreased to 55% (± 29%) in the first week (d114-d120), and all

196

the way to zero in the second week (d121-d127) for two of the three reactors (Fig. 1).

197

Among nitrifiers, the three most abundant bacterial genera detected through DNA sequencing

198

were Nitrospira, Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter. During the perturbation phase, Nitrospira was

199

suppressed in high F:M-C:N reactors, while Nitrosomonas remained at around half the abundance

200

levels observed for low F:M-C:N reactors (Fig. 2). This coincided with the accumulation of nitrite in

201

high F:M-C:N reactors during the d54-d113 period of the study (Fig. 1). Similar patterns of nitrifier

202

abundance across low and high F:M-C:N replicates were observed for metagenomics and 16S rRNA

203

gene amplicon sequencing datasets (Fig. 2).

204

Following the shift from high to low F:M-C:N it was Nitrobacter that rose to be the dominant

205

NOB instead of Nitrospira, but only in two of three reactors (Fig. 2). Variations in performance

206

among replicate reactors were also evident from cycle study profiles before (d110) and after (d124)

207

the shift in feeding regime for the high F:M-C:N reactors (Fig. 3). Two weeks after the change, only

208

two high to low F:M-C:N reactors displayed functional profiles similar to those of the low F:M-C:N

209

reactors. The reactors which recovered functionality were the same as those that registered around 1%

210

of Nitrobacter abundance (Fig. 2).

211

The higher resolution of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing allowed us to taxonomically

212

identify four ASVs as Nitrospira, twenty-one as Nitrosomonas, and one as Nitrobacter (Fig. 4). From

213

these, only two ASVs were identified at the species level. The genus Nitrospira was dominated by the

214

N. defluvii species, with the other three ASVs detected only at low abundances across the low F:M-

215

C:N reactors after d97, the day the aeration rate was increased. The dominant Nitrosomonas ASVs

216

during the perturbation phase were different from the initial ones. Furthermore, N. europaea and

217

Nitrosomonas ASV-70 saw their relative abundances increasing with time across high F:M-C:N

218

reactors (Fig. 4).

4. Discussion

220

4.1. Function stabilization and nitrifier dynamics during acclimation phase

221

Sludge acclimation served to stabilize important functions like nitrification, organic carbon

222

removal, and sludge settling capacity across reactors (Fig. 1, Fig. S3). The most abundant nitrifying

223

genus was Nitrospira, which increased around 50% after the acclimation stage. The next most

224

abundant nitrifier, Nitrosomonas, increased sixfold (Fig. 2) and the changes in abundance of different

225

Nitrosomonas ASVs suggested a succession of organisms within this genus (Fig. 4). Additionally,

226

through the use of exact sequence variants [39] we could observe that Nitrosomonas was the most

227

diverse nitrifying genus with twenty-one different ASVs being detected (Fig. 4).

228

4.2. Disturbance leads to stable partial nitrification unveiling system’s resistance

229

Ecosystem function in terms of COD removal, ammonia removal, and complete nitrification

230

was optimal and stable for the low F:M-C:N reactors, particularly towards the end of the study (Fig.

231

1). On the other hand, press disturbed reactors (high F:M-C:N) experienced a reduction in nitrate

232

production and COD removal. The shift in function was not immediate as the first seven days

233

registered transient nitrite accumulation, which was variable among replicates, before stabilizing with

234

little within-treatment variability for the rest of the perturbation phase. The increase in residual nitrite

235

likely had a negative effect on COD removal due to the known toxicity of NO2- to bacteria [45].

236

Nitrification was not completely inhibited because 23% of the NOX--N products still consisted

237

of nitrate during the d61-d113 period. This percentage constitutes a quantitative measure of resistance

238

for the nitrification function, as it shows the degree to which this particular function was insensitive to

239

disturbance [46]. The higher variability in function among replicates during the first seven-day

240

transition period is an example of the stochastic effects that a disturbance initially triggers in

241

ecosystems [4]. Since the disturbance was sustained in this case, selective pressure likely promoted

242

deterministic mechanisms resulting in a less variable function over time (Fig. 1). This is similar to

243

what has been previously reported for studies on sludge bioreactors under sustained 3-chloroaniline

244

perturbation [5].

245

4.3 Dynamics of nitrifiers during the perturbation phase

246

Understanding community and activity dynamics of nitrifying bacteria is essential for

247

improving design and operation of wastewater treatment biological processes [47]. The suppression of

248

Nitrospira in the high F:M-C:N reactors (Fig. 2) was likely due to competition for DO with

249

heterotrophs and Nitrosomonas that possess a higher affinity for DO [48, 49]. The same competition

250

for DO occurs between Nitrosomonas and heterotrophs, which explains the observed lower abundance

251

of this genus in high F:M-C:N reactors. It is known that AOB have a higher oxygen affinity than NOB

252

[50]. Still, the increase in aeration rates from d97 onward did not prevent nitrite accumulation,

253

indicating that a low DO in the system was not the main reason behind our observations. DO

254

concentrations higher than 1 mg/L are enough to achieve optimal nitrification performance [51],

255

which was the case for the reactors in this study (Fig. 3). However, nitrifying communities grow in

256

stratified biofilms where AOB are located closer to the water interface and NOB are in the interior

257

zone [52, 53]. The concentration of oxygen deep inside a biofilm or floc is lower than in the mixed

258

liquor. Moreover, stratification in AOB biofilms due to an increase in C:N has been reported [48],

259

highlighting that increases in biofilm thickness due to heterotrophic growth further reduce oxygen

260

diffusion inside, which is detrimental to the growth of NOB. In our study, the period during the

261

aerobic phase of a cycle when almost all ammonia had been removed and COD concentrations were

262

either low or remained constant (around 400-500 min, Fig. 3) implies that heterotrophs and AOB were

263

not competing with NOB for oxygen anymore. Although this should have provided sufficient oxygen

264

to NOB to be active during the remainder of the aerobic phase, an increase in nitrate production was

265

not observed. A possible reason for this could be nitrite accumulation, which was reported to be toxic

266

to NOB at high concentrations [54]. In summary, the observed NOB suppression at high F:M-C:N

267

could have been due to a combination of competition for DO with heterotrophs and Nitrosomonas,

268

reduced oxygen diffusion into the nitrifier biofilm due to heterotrophic growth, and nitrite

269

accumulation due to AOB activity.

270

AOB growth rates are normally higher than those of NOB at 30 °C, which implies that the

271

SRT can be reduced to achieve partial nitrification [55]. In our study, increasing F:M while keeping

272

TSS constant implied an SRT reduction of 35% in the high F:M-C:N reactors compared to the low

273

F:M-C:N reactors. It is conceivable that part of the observed reduction in nitrifiers was due to washout

274

given their low growth rates. It was suggested based on mathematical modelling that a reduction in

275

SRT has a stronger effect on NOB than on AOB [56]. However, the SRT of 8.2 d (aerobic SRT of 5.1

276

d) used to operate the high F:M reactors is common in activated sludge processes performing

277

complete nitrification [18, 57], and well above the operating SRT of 5-6 d at the full-scale plant that

278

provided the sludge inoculum for this study. SRT values of 4-8 d have been suggested as optimum for

279

nitrification in practice [57, 58], while complete nitrification has been reported for SRT values as low

280

as 2 d [59]. Thus, our observed changes in nitrifiers and nitrification function were driven by

281

controlled changes in F:M and C:N values and not by washout of NOB due to a low SRT.

282

4.4 Importance of assessing F:M, C:N and SRT simultaneously for nitrification studies

283

We showed that a combined high F:M-C:N approach led to stable and reproducible nitrite

284

accumulation (77%) after seven days of transition. This finding holds promise as a new partial

285

nitrification strategy to achieve biological nitrogen removal from wastewater via partial

286

nitritation/anammox [27]. A comparison with earlier studies where either F:M or C:N was the

287

parameter of interest reveals conflicting and inconclusive outcomes. For example, similar to our

288

results, conditions at high F:M resulted in higher nitrite accumulation compared to low F:M in studies

289

on full-scale sludge systems that focused on the effect of varying F:M directly [60] or indirectly

290

through changes in SRT [10, 23]. Likewise, nitrite accumulation was found at high influent C:N (10

291

mg COD/mg NH4+-N) in a pilot-scale study using a CSTR [32]. However, contrary to our results, low

292

influent C:N values (1-3 mg COD/mg NH4+-N) in high-strength industrial wastewaters were reported

293

to yield partial nitrification in a review of full-scale anammox processes [55]. Also, nitrite

294

accumulation was reported at low C:N values in studies using a 35-L SBR (~2 mg COD/mg TN) [29],

295

a lab-scale 6.3-L SBR (3.33 mg COD/mg NH4+-N) [31], and a pilot-scale continuous-flow A/O/A

296

reactor (3.19 mg COD/mg NH4+-N) [30]. On the other hand, there was complete nitrification without

297

nitrite accumulation at low influent C:N (3 ± 1 mg COD/mg TN) in pilot-scale membrane batch

298

reactors [28], similar to our results. Increasing C:N molar ratios from 2 to 5 was shown to

299

significantly reduce nitrification rates in a laboratory denitrification-nitrification system [61], although

300

the study did not mention whether this caused nitrite accumulation. Moreover, nitrite accumulation

301

was even reported for fluctuating low and high influent C:N values (2.5-8 mg COD/mg NH4+-N) in

302

two different pilot-scale studies using SBRs [33, 34]. These multiple opposing findings in the

303

literature imply that other factors in addition to C:N affect nitrification, which need to be accounted

304

for. Changes in C:N also affect F:M values by altering the available carbon for heterotrophic growth.

305

As neither of the aforementioned studies controlled the covariations in F:M when changing the C:N,

306

their respective roles cannot be disentangled. Hence, we emphasize the need to evaluate these

307

interconnected parameters simultaneously.

308

In practice, control of TSS is critical to operational control strategies based on either F:M or

309

SRT [57, 58]. In our study design, doubling the amount of COD in the influent almost doubled both

310

F:M and C:N values, as operational TSS and influent TKN were controlled to remain close to

311

constant. Doubling the influent COD also doubled the OLR, and higher COD concentrations also

312

increased the biomass produced per unit time; thus more sludge had to be wasted to keep the TSS

313

constant, reducing the SRT as a consequence (details in supplementary information). This point serves

314

to illustrate that important operational parameters like SRT, C:N and OLR also co-vary with F:M

315

[57], which is precisely why they have to be evaluated simultaneously during experimentation. Our

316

literature review suggests that this interrelationship has not received the attention it deserves. For

317

example, a recent study on the effect of reducing the SRT from 30 to 3 days in a full-scale plant [10]

318

reported a washout of Nitrospira and an associated decrease in nitrogen removal efficiency and nitrite

319

accumulation, but this happened at the expense of a ten-fold increase in F:M (0.03-0.33 mg COD/mg

320

TSS/d). The C:N values in this study were not controlled. This seems to be common practice as

321

several recent studies, using sludge bioreactors to test the effect of varying SRT on nitrification and

322

nitrifiers, neither controlled covariations in F:M nor accounted for changing C:N values [59, 62-64].

323

One of the studies, however, highlighted the importance of F:M covariations with SRT for assessing P

324

removal [62]. We posit that experimental changes in SRT, without also controlling for covariations in

325

F:M and C:N, can lead to erroneous conclusions about dynamics of nitrifying communities and the

326

nitrification process due to confounding factors.

327

4.5 Resilience of ecosystem function and nitrifiers

328

Since perturbations often occur in biotechnological systems, it is desirable to understand the

329

mechanisms of recovery after disturbance [65], for which experimental replication is paramount to

330

ensure reproducibility [66] and capture fluctuations in process instability [67]. Several recent studies

331

on variations of C:N and SRT in sludge bioreactors could not make such an assessment because their

332

designs did not include replication [10, 30-34, 56, 59, 68, 69]. Hence, we tested the effect of returning

333

the high F:M-C:N to their previous low levels on the functional resilience of the replicated perturbed

334

reactors. The switch back had noticeable effects on nitrifier communities (Figs. 2 and 4) as well as on

335

the nitrification function (Figs. 1 and 3). Relative abundances of Nitrosomonas genera recovered

336

quickly after returning to pre-perturbation conditions. High F:M-C:N reactors exhibited variable

337

functional resilience because after ten days of returning to pre-perturbation conditions only two of

338

three reactors completely recovered the nitrification function. This inconsistency among independent

339

replicate reactors could be due to the stochastic growth after disturbance typically associated with r-

340

strategists [70] and ruderal organisms [71]. According to the r/K ecological framework (Table 1),

341

early niche colonization stages should favour r-strategists, whereas K-strategies should prevail at a

342

later stage when many organisms attempt to colonize [72]. In our study, the variable nitrification

343

recovery after removing the high F:M-C:N perturbation seemed to be due to stochastic colonization

344

by r-strategist NOB (Nitrobacter), replacing the niche initially occupied by K-strategist NOB

345

(Nitrospira) before perturbation. Besides having a fast growth rate [73] and prevailing at alternating

346

conditions [74], Nitrobacter has been shown to thrive at higher DO [75] and nitrite [60]

347

concentrations, which explains why its abundance increased in the previously high F:M-C:N reactors

348

after the shift to low F:M-C:N conditions. However, as part of a secondary succession process after

349

disturbance, it is possible that Nitrospira would have recovered as a dominant NOB if more time had

350

been allowed in the study.

351

Our reactors constituted a closed system, which implies that the Nitrobacter colonizers came

352

from low-abundance seed-bank populations (Table 1). It was proposed that disturbance opens niches

353

for bacterial colonization in open sludge systems [76], but we showed that recruitment of organisms

354

from the seed-bank is also possible. Moreover, as immigration of nitrifiers into sludge systems has

355

been shown to alter the local community composition and function [77, 78], studies of nitrification

356

resilience in open sludge systems [10] cannot disentangle the effect of immigrating populations from

357

their observations.

358

Here we showed that functional resilience greatly differed from nitrifying community

359

resilience. Reactors with recovered function after returning to low F:M-C:N conditions (Fig. 3)

360

remained distinct from the control reactors in terms of NOB composition (Fig. 2). The fact that an

361

altered community can perform the same functions as the original one supports the idea of functional

362

redundancy [79] and the insurance hypothesis [80]. This finding is similar to what was found in a full-

363

scale sludge system after a press disturbance [10], but contrary to what was reported for lake

364

microbial systems after a pulse disturbance [81]. These contrasting reports highlight the complexity of

365

assessing disturbance-diversity-function relationships [82], as they depend not only on the system

366

assessed but also on the disturbance frequency (i.e., pulse or press). Finally, the variability in the

367

recovery of the nitrification function and fluctuations in nitrifier populations could only be captured

368

thanks to the replication employed in the design of our study. As we move towards stable operation

369

for microbial resource management [65], future perturbation studies on sludge bioreactors should be

370

robustly designed to ensure process reproducibility and highlight operational ranges where functional

371

variability can be encountered.

372

5. Conclusions

373

•

A combined high F:M and C:N approach for NOB suppression can be used to achieve stable

374

and reproducible nitrite accumulation (around 77%) in activated sludge at tropical

375

temperatures. This approach is relevant to nitritation-denitritation systems, particularly for

376

industrial wastewater treatment applications.

377

•

Variations in interconnected operational parameters in bioreactors (such as F:M, C:N, OLR and

378

SRT) should be assessed simultaneously to better understand their effects on nitrification and

379

nitrifiers, as well as on general microbial community function and structure.

380

•

381
382

Functional resistance and resilience can be variable across identically operated reactors,
highlighting the importance of replication for perturbation studies.

•

Resilience of the nitrification function can differ from nitrifying community structure resilience,

383

as reactors with recovered function after returning from high to low F:M and C:N conditions

384

remained distinct from the low F:M and C:N reactors in terms of the predominant nitrite

385

oxidizers present.

386

•

The partial recovery of nitrite oxidation after removing the high F:M and C:N perturbation

387

seemed to be due to stochastic colonization by seed-bank r-strategist NOB (Nitrobacter),

388

replacing the niche initially occupied by K-strategist NOB (Nitrospira) before perturbation.

389

Hence, immigration of new taxa was not required.

390
391
392

•

Controlled perturbation studies on sludge communities using parameters within the range of
plant operation can lead to not only ecologically but also practically meaningful insights.

Table 1. Glossary of key microbial ecology concepts
Concept

Definition

Community

A group of populations of two or more different microbial taxa (e.g. nitrifiers) occupying the same geographical space (e.g. bioreactor) at a
particular time [2].

Community structure

The composition and relative abundance of different microbial taxa within a community at a given time [2].

Disturbance

An event that significantly alters the environment of a community, creating opportunities for individuals to grow and reproduce [12] (e.g. a
change in feeding strategy). Also referred to as perturbation.

Ecosystem

A community of living organisms in conjunction with the abiotic components of their environment, interacting as a system [2] (e.g. a
bioreactor).

Ecosystem function

Outputs of functional processes at a whole ecosystem level [83] (e.g. ammonia removal within a bioreactor).

Immigration

Large-scale movement of members of a species to a different environment [84] (e.g. bacteria within the feed entering a bioreactor).

Niche

The abiotic and biotic conditions that a microbial taxa need to grow, survive and reproduce [85].

Press disturbance

A long-term or continuous disturbance [7] (e.g. a sustained change in organic loading).

r- and K- strategists

Classification given to organisms under the r- vs. K-strategies ecological framework. Among nitrifiers, Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter are rstrategists able to grow fast under high substrate concentration conditions, while Nitrosospira and Nitrospira are K-strategists that grow slowly
but are adapted to low substrate concentrations [70, 72].

Resilience

The capacity of a community and/or function to return to a pre-disturbance condition [86].

Resistance

The degree to which a community and/or function is insensitive to a disturbance [86].

Seed-bank population

Refers to the members within a community that are present in low abundances, but are able to grow when given the appropriate conditions [87].

Stability

The response of a community to disturbance [12]. It is comprised of resistance and resilience, which are two quantifiable metrics useful for
comparing community disturbance responses [79, 88]. The stability of a community can be studied in terms of functional and/or compositional
parameters [7].

Stochastic growth

Refers to growth under conditions that are not deterministic but random in nature [4]. Examples are priority effects (i.e. colonizing first, by
chance, a recently open niche) and ecological drift (i.e. random events of birth and death).
