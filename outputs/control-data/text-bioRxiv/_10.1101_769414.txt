Abstract

Wrist posture impacts the muscle lengths and moment arms of the extrinsic finger muscles that cross
the wrist. As a result, the electromyographic (EMG) activity associated with digit movement at different
wrist postures may also change. Therefore, we sought to quantify the posture-dependence of extrinsic
finger muscle activity. Fine-wire bipolar electrodes were inserted in the extrinsic hand muscles of ablebodied subjects to record EMG activity during wrist and finger movements in various postures. EMG
activity of all the recorded finger muscles were significantly different (p<.05, ANOVA) when performing
the same movement in five different wrist postures. EMG activity varied by up to 70%, with the highest
levels of activity observed in finger extensors when the wrist was extended. Similarly, finger flexors were
most active when the wrist was flexed. For the finger flexors, EMG variations with wrist posture were
most prominent for index finger muscles, while the EMG activity of all finger extensor muscles were
similarly modulated. The extrinsic finger muscles also showed significant activity during wrist
movements with the digits held still regardless of finger posture, suggesting that they may play a role in
generating torque during wrist movements. Finally, we developed a pair of generalized classifiers that
show that finger muscle EMG can be used to predict wrist posture. These results may impact the design
of biomimetic control algorithms for myoelectric prosthetic hands, but further work in transradial
amputees is necessary to determine whether this phenomenon persists after amputation.
Introduction

The human hand is a complex biomechanical system which relies on intrinsic active and passive forces to
maintain postures and perform movements. The movement of a single finger alone generates torque at
the wrist that must be counteracted to maintain wrist posture. Single digit motion also generates
torque in neighboring digits , a phenomenon known as force enslavement, which must also be
counteracted by other finger muscles. The force enslavement effect has been suggested to be a
combination of passive mechanical coupling driven by tendinous connections between digits as well as
active coupling from higher order motor commands . While there has been an effort to characterize
the resulting electromyography (EMG) activity in these scenarios, prior work has primarily used surface
EMG recordings and/or examined only a single muscle at a time , leaving an incomplete understanding
of how the many extrinsic hand muscles coordinate for single and multiple digit movements.
Intramuscular EMG is an alternative method of recording EMG signals by placing fine-wire electrodes
through the skin directly into muscles. Intramuscular recordings have been used for over 50 years to
characterize muscle activity and provides focal recording from a single target muscle that is difficult
or impossible to achieve with standard surface EMG. Fine-wire electrodes can also record distinct signals
from deep muscles and the different compartments of the multicompartment finger flexor and extensor
muscles .
Extensive work has demonstrated that coupling between the digits is composed of mechanical and
neural components
, although the influence of inter-digit coupling on the coordination of single

and multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) movements is not well understood. Experiments in humans have
shown that electrical stimulation induces more focal and independent finger forces compared to
volitional movement, suggesting that neural coupling does in fact result from cortical motor control
strategies . The influence of coupling is also visible during EMG recordings; an example may be seen in
the work by Leijnse et al. , which shows phasic EMG activity in the extensor digiti minimi during a thumb
tapping task. However, EMG activity of other muscles which appear to be functionally unrelated to the
actuation of a joint may contain unique information that is relevant for prosthetic control. Improved
EMG decoder performance was observed by Smith et al. when all recorded extrinsic hand muscles
were included in the decoder regression equations for each DOF.
Wrist posture is known to have mechanical effects on the fingers, the most direct being motion of the
relaxed fingers while the wrist is flexed and extended. For example, when the wrist is extended the
fingers naturally curl into a tenodesis grasp . This occurs because the extrinsic finger flexor muscles
span the wrist and are subject to lengthening based on wrist angle, which in turn causes an increase in
passive tension in the flexor muscles . The resulting increase in force has also been shown to affect the
EMG activity necessary to maintain the static pose of a digit . Grip force is also affected by wrist
posture, which may be observed through alterations in EMG activity . Duque et al. quantified this
relationship between grip force and EMG as a series of nonlinear models for flexed, extended, and
neutral postures, demonstrating that wrist posture alters the relationship between grip force generation
and EMG, but it is unknown whether the posture/EMG relationship is effected in low force movements.
In addition, a further motivation to study the relationship between extrinsic finger muscle EMG activity
and wrist posture is the potential impact on the design of biomimetic-inspired musculoskeletal modelbased control systems for prosthetic hands. Dexterous prosthetic hands exist, but a significant barrier to
adoption is a lack of control algorithms which may take advantage of the high degree-of-freedom
control that is offered . Biomimetically-inspired control algorithms could possibly improve control ,
thus we sought to improve the understanding of the relationship between extrinsic finger muscle EMG
activity and wrist posture.
In this study we used intramuscular EMG to target the compartments of the flexor digitorum profundus
(FDP), flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor digitorum (ED), as well as the extensor digiti
minimi (EDM) and the extensor indicis proprius (EIP) muscle, and sought to characterize the effect of
changing wrist joint angles on EMG activity of the extrinsic finger muscles during structured hand
movements. We also examined how the extrinsic finger muscles may assist in wrist movements
themselves.

Experimental Summary
11 healthy, able-bodied subjects (7 males, 4 females) were included in this study. Subject ages ranged
from 25-32 with an average age of 28.2±2.7 years. All subjects provided informed consent prior to any
experimental procedure and all procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh and Army
Research Labs Institutional Review Boards. Sixteen percutaneous EMG electrodes were implanted in the
extrinsic hand muscles that control the major finger and wrist flexion and extension movements.
Subjects wore a glove fitted with electromagnetic trackers to capture hand kinematics. Subjects then
performed an extensive series of single joint movements with varying finger and wrist postures while
EMG and kinematics were recorded.

Percutaneous EMG Recording
Percutaneous fine wire bipolar electrodes (30 and 50 mm long paired fine wire needle electrodes,
Chalgren Enterprises, Inc.) were placed in sixteen of the following muscle locations and compartments
under ultrasound guidance by an experienced physician: the 2 and 4 compartments of the extensor
digitorum (ED2, ED4), the extensor digiti minimi (EDM), flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS2-4), flexor
digitorum profundus (FDP2-5), flexor pollicis longus (FPL), abductor pollicis longus (APL), extensor
pollicis longus (EPL), extensor indicis proprius (EIP), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), flexor carpi radialis (FCR),
extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), pronator teres (PT), and supinator
(SUP) muscles. The 2 and 4 compartments of the extensor digitorum were selected for the greatest
separation between signals. We broadly targeted the extrinsic hand muscles during implantation to
achieve a representation of the extrinsic hand muscles which controlled the major degrees of freedom
of the hand. Muscle locations were identified using palpation and ultrasonographic visualization
techniques during instructed movements to guide electrode insertion . Intramuscular EMG recordings
were digitized with a multichannel neural recording system (Grapevine Neural Interface System with
Surf S2 headstage, Ripple, Inc) at 30 kHz.
Kinematic Motion Tracking
Hand and arm kinematics were recorded using an electromagnetic tracking system (trakStar, Ascension
Technology, Inc.) integrated into the MotionMonitor (Innovative Sports Training Inc.,
http://www.TheMotionMonitor.com) recording software. The tracking sensors were attached to a
glove, and located over the proximal, intermediate, and distal phalanges of the index finger; the
proximal and distal phalanges of the middle, ring, and little finger; the metacarpal and phalanges of the
thumb; and the dorsal center of metacarpals (Fig. 1a). Tracking sensors were also placed over the distal
portion of the radius and lateral aspect of the biceps to track the position of the arm. Subject-specific
arm and hand segments were then created using the digitization process in the MotionMonitor
software. The OpenSim v3.3 Inverse Kinematics tool was then used to extract the joint angles from the
.trc files using a scaled musculoskeletal model .
Experimental Tasks
Subjects were asked to follow the movements of a virtual hand displayed on a computer screen (Fig.
1b). Each movement exercised a single DOF of the fingers or wrist for ten repetitions at 1 Hz. D2-D5
flexion/extension and wrist flexion/extension movements were tested. For D2-D5 movements, subjects
were asked to produce coupled motions of the metacarpal phalangeal joint along with the proximal and
distal interphalangeal joints, with a focus on moving the metacarpal phalangeal joint through 90
degrees. All fingers motions were repeated while the subject maintained the wrist in a neutral posture
(hand aligned with the forearm and thumb pointing up), or with the wrist in a flexed, extended,
pronated, or supinated position at the limit of the wrist range of motion. During wrist movements, the
fingers were held in either flexed or extended positions and the exercises were performed while the
wrist was held neutral, pronated, or supinated. Pronation/supination movements were only performed
during neutral wrist postures. The initial posture for D2-D5 movements was with all fingers extended
and the wrist in one of five positions. For wrist movements, the initial starting pose was with the wrist
held neutral and the fingers either flexed or extended, depending on the trial. A list of all performed
trials is provided in Supplementary Table S1.

Data Processing
Kinematic and EMG signals were processed offline using Matlab (The Mathworks, version 2016b).
Kinematic data were smoothed with a 4 order low-pass Butterworth filter at 10 Hz to remove noise.
Single-ended intramuscular EMG recordings were differenced, then high-pass filtered with a 4th order
high-pass Butterworth filter at 10 Hz before undergoing a pre-processing step (see below) to remove
electromagnetic noise generated by the kinematic motion tracking system (Fig 2a). Following this, EMG
data were band-pass filtered with a 4 order Butterworth between 100 to 4000 Hz to remove
movement artifacts, line noise, and high frequency noise. Potential extrinsic finger muscle recordings
were excluded during the data analysis phase if the EMG activity from an electrode was not modulated
by single digit movement, or if the electrode recordings were significantly contaminated by artifacts due
to the fragility of the fine-wire electrodes. Artifacts were identified based on signal amplitude and
shape. Events with peak voltages much greater than those occurring during a maximal voluntary
contraction, or events with large instantaneous changes in amplitude or that did not resemble typical
EMG activity or motor unit action potentials were considered artifacts. If multiple electrodes were in the
same muscle or muscle compartment for a subject, we included only a single electrode with the highest
signal-to-noise ratio.
The Ascension trakSTAR motion tracking system provides the ability to track the location of a sensor in
space by creating a pulsed electromagnetic field in the workspace. This enables sensors to be tracked
even when obscured. However, the changing electromagnetic field was also captured by the EMG
recording system as a series of pulses occurring at the pulse frequency of 100 Hz. We removed this noise
from recordings offline while preserving the EMG signals by generating a template pulse train, and then
subtracting it from the data. An example of the EMG signal before and after electromagnetic noise
removal is shown in Fig. 2a.

Data Analysis and Statistics
We divided the EMG data for every trial into flexion and extension phases using the kinematic
recordings (Fig. 2b). The angular velocities were low-pass filtered with a zero-phase digital filter at 10 Hz.
We detected the movement phases by first identifying the positive and negative peak velocities.
Movement onset was then detected based on the first zero velocity point preceding each peak, while
the end of a movement was the first zero velocity point after a peak. The filtered EMG data were
integrated over the relevant movement windows and divided by the duration of the movement to
quantify the EMG activity over the period. For example, the flexor digitorum superficialis was integrated
during flexion movements and the extensor digitorum was integrated during extension movements.
Finger Movements

Integrated EMG activity for single digit movements were grouped across subjects based on the muscle in
which electrodes were placed. For the muscles with multiple compartments (ED, FDS, and FDP),
integrated EMG data were separated based on the compartment and digit actuated. A list of each
muscle analyzed and the number of subjects per muscle are shown in Supplementary Table S2. The
mean integrated EMG activity for each muscle and subject was calculated for the five postures: neutral,
flexed, extended, pronated, and supinated (Fig. 2c). The integrated EMG data were then normalized to
the highest of the means. The normalized integrated EMG activity of each muscle and compartment
were tested for significant differences using a two-way ANOVA with subject and wrist posture (neutral,
flexed, extended, pronated, and supinated) as factors. Post-hoc pairwise testing to identify differences

in EMG activity for movements in the postures assessed was performed using Tukey’s honest significant
differences (HSD) test for multiple comparisons.
Wrist Movements

For each subject and electrode, the mean integrated EMG activity for each finger muscle was calculated
for the four combinations of finger postures and wrist movements: fingers extended (‘flat’) during wrist
flexion and extension and fingers flexed (‘fist’) during wrist flexion and extension. For the four
movements, the EMG activity of each muscle and subject was normalized to the maximum activity to
compare across subjects. The normalized EMG activity of ED, EDM and EIP muscles were combined into
a single ‘extensors’ group, while FDS and FDP were combined into a ‘flexors’ group. Since the data were
not normally distributed (p<.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,) a Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted on the
EMG activity of the extrinsic finger flexors and extensors to detect whether EMG activity of finger flexors
and extensors differed based on finger position. Post-hoc pairwise testing was performed using Dunn’s
test with a Bonferroni correction.
Classifying Wrist Posture from Extrinsic Finger Muscle EMG Activity

To investigate whether extrinsic finger muscle EMG signals might contain information about wrist
posture, we developed a classifier to examine the capability of predicting wrist posture based on finger
EMG activity alone. We trained two linear discriminant analysis classifiers, one for the extrinsic finger
extensors and the other for the flexors, to predict if the movement of a digit was performed when the
wrist was held in a flexed, neutral, or extended wrist posture. Each classifier was cross-validated using kfolds, with k = 5.
Results

Finger Movements at Different Wrist Postures
Finger Extensors

For all the finger extensor muscles, both posture and subject had a significant main effect on EMG
activity (p<.0001, ANOVA). Further, the EMG activity of every finger extensor muscle was highest when
the wrist was held in an extended posture. This activity was significantly higher than all other postures
assessed (p<.001, Tukey’s HSD, Fig. 3). In contrast, when the wrist was flexed, the finger extensors
generated the lowest level of EMG activity during the extension phase of the motion, ranging from
mean levels of 30 ± 13% to 53 ± 30% of their maximum activity level with the wrist was extended. This
strong pattern of EMG activity in response to wrist posture was consistent across all of the extensor
muscles with the highest levels of EMG activity occurring when the wrist was extended and the lowest
levels occurring when the wrist was flexed. EMG activity for the finger extensors with the wrist in the
neutral, pronated, and supinated postures was at an intermediate level and varied depending on the
muscle. When the wrist was held neutral during digit extension movements, average EMG activity
ranged from 47 ± 22% to 61 ± 35% of its maximum value with the lowest activity occurring in the D2
extensors (ED2, EIP) and progressively increasing for ED4 and ED5. Average EMG activity when the wrist
was pronated ranged from 50 ± 28% to 67 ± 21%. Notably, the two index finger extensor muscles were
differentially modulated when the wrist was pronated. While the ED2 and EIP activity was similar when
the wrist was in the neutral, extended or supinated postures, the average EMG activity for ED2 and EIP
was 50 ± 28% and 61 ± 26%, respectively when the wrist was pronated. This effect may be driven by the
differing origin and insertion points of the ED and EIP muscles, which are accentuated during wrist
pronation. With the wrist supinated, EMG activity across all the finger extensors varied the least, with all
muscles having average activity levels between 49 ± 33% and 59 ± 31% of their maximum.

Of the extensor muscles assessed, ED4 showed the greatest difference in activity based on wrist
posture. Of the ten possible pairwise comparisons (e.g. neutral vs. flexed, neutral vs. extended), all but
neutral vs. supinated postures showed significant differences (p<.01, Tukey’s HSD). ED2 and EDM were
affected the least by changing wrist posture; only pairwise comparisons testing extension against the
other postures showed statistical significance (Fig. 3e).
[Figure 3]

Finger Flexors

Similar to the finger extensors, wrist posture had a significant effect on the EMG activity of all of the
finger flexor muscles (p<.001 for all muscles except FDS4, p<.05, ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD). The finger
flexor muscles were most active when the wrist was held in the flexed posture, with the exception of
FDS4 and FDP4, which were most active in a neutral posture with EMG activities of 87 ± 25% and 95 ±
26%, respectively. With the wrist in the neutral posture, the other flexor muscles had average activity
levels that were much lower and ranged between 54 ± 18% to 73 ± 22% (Fig. 4). For FDS4 and FDP4, the
mean EMG activity when the wrist was flexed was 86 ± 29% and 87 ± 36% respectively, while the other
finger flexors ranged from 86 ± 33% to 100 ± 22%. This result was unusual compared to the typical
behavior of the finger flexors and may be due to anatomical differences in how the muscle lengths are
affected by wrist posture. In contrast to the finger extensors, the individual finger flexor muscles
showed little difference between extended, pronated, and supinated postures. Interestingly, the overall
effect of wrist posture on EMG activity appeared to decrease for digits further away from D2 (Fig. 4).
[Figure 4]

Inter-Subject Variance

For all muscles that were assessed, excluding FDS2, the individual subject had a significant effect on how
wrist posture effected extrinsic finger muscle EMG activity (p<.05, Tukey’s HSD). This main effect
response was primarily driven by high responders, which were subjects that had high levels of finger
EMG activity when the wrist posture matched the action of the finger muscle (e.g. wrist extension for
finger extensors). Subject 4 in Fig. 3a is an example of this. Similar to the other ED2 muscles, Subject 4
showed the highest level of activity when the wrist was held in the extended posture. However, unlike
the other subjects, ED2 was much less active in all other wrist postures. Other examples of this
phenomenon are EIP in Subject 9 (Fig. 3d) and EDM in Subject 10 (Fig. 3c). This effect was less
pronounced in the finger flexor muscles.
Extrinsic Muscle Finger EMG Activity During Wrist Movements
The extrinsic finger extensor muscles were highly active during wrist extension regardless of the finger
posture. In fact, finger extensor EMG activity was significantly higher when the fingers were fully flexed
and the wrist was being extended than when the fingers were extended and the wrist was being flexed
(p<.001, Dunn’s, Fig. 5a). In the four combinations assessed (wrist extension/flexion with fingers
extended/flexed), the extrinsic finger extensor EMG showed a wide range of activity levels. The highest
EMG activity occurred during wrist extension when the fingers were held extended where the median
normalized EMG activity from the finger extensors was 98% (IQR 85%-111%). When the wrist was
extending and the fingers were held flexed, the median normalized EMG for the finger extensors
declined to 52% (IQR 35%-77%). During wrist flexion movements, EMG activity was the lowest for the
finger extensor muscles. When the fingers were held extended, median normalized EMG activity was
28% (IQR 16%-44%) and was even smaller at 18% (IQR 9%-33%) when the fingers were held flexed. The

results showed significant differences in EMG activity for all pairwise comparisons of movement/posture
combinations (p<.001, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc test). Overall, we found that the finger
extensor EMG activity changed by more than a factor of three when the fingers were held extended
based on whether the wrist was moving in extension or flexion.
The EMG activation patterns of the finger flexor muscles showed a similar pattern to that observed in
the finger extensors, with finger flexors significantly more active during wrist flexion movements than
wrist extension movements, even when extension was performed with the fingers in a fist (Fig. 5b). The
highest EMG activity of the movements and postures assessed occurred during wrist flexion when the
fingers were fully flexed at a median normalized EMG activity of 96% (IQR 82%-111%). The next highest
level of EMG activity was during wrist flexion with the fingers extended with a median normalized value
of 49% (IQR 21%-72%), nearly half of the highest value. Even when the fingers were being actively held
in extension, finger flexor muscles were active during wrist flexion movements. EMG activity for the
finger flexors was lowest during wrist extension movements; during extension movements with the
fingers flexed, the median normalized EMG activity was 29% (IQR 15%-47%). When the wrist was
extended and the fingers were extended, median normalized EMG activity was the lowest at 15% (IQR
7%-27%). The difference in activity levels were all significant (p<.001, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s
post-hoc test) and varied by more than threefold depending on whether the wrist was flexing or
extending when the fingers were fully flexed.
[Figure 5]

Classifying Wrist Posture from Extrinsic Finger Muscle EMG Activity
Since we found that that extrinsic finger muscle EMG activity was often highly modulated by wrist
posture, we asked whether wrist posture itself could be classified simply from the flexor or extensor
finger muscle EMG activity. Overall, using just finger extensor muscles, the classifier accuracy was 63.5%
± 4.0% (99% confidence interval) and using just finger flexor muscles, the classifier accuracy was 47.4% ±
4.3% (99% confidence interval), both which were significantly above the chance level of 33%. True class
prediction accuracy varied depending on the posture but followed the same pattern for both classifiers
(Fig. 6). The most accurate true class predictions occurred when the wrist was held in the same posture
as the finger action: wrist extended for the finger extensors (86.9%) and wrist flexed for the finger
flexors (66.4%). When the wrist was in a neutral posture, true class accuracies were lowest for both
classifiers at 32.7% for the finger extensors and 22.5% for the finger flexors. The confusion matrices and
true class accuracy for both classifiers are shown in Fig. 6, and additional information on precision and
recall is provided in Supplementary Table 3.

Discussion

In this study, we found that there were wrist posture-dependent effects on extrinsic finger muscle EMG
activity, which is consistent with previous reports
. We also expanded on this work by
investigating EMG activity from the individual muscle compartments of the FDS, FDP and ED muscles, as
well as using low-force movements that have not been previously studied. An important issue is that
using intramuscular electrodes instead of surface electrodes increased the likelihood that the recorded
signals were indeed from the same muscle in all postures. With surface EMG, there can be significant
motion of the muscles under the skin, making it difficult to ensure that recordings at all wrist postures
would be from the same muscle .

In these experiments, we found that during single digit motions, both the finger flexors and extensors
exhibited significant changes in their EMG activity based on the posture of the wrist, and in some cases
varied by as much as 70% of the normalized value. We have also shown evidence that the extrinsic
finger muscles have higher levels of activity during wrist movements that are performed in the same
direction of action regardless of finger posture, which suggests that these muscles assist with unloaded
wrist movements. These muscles may therefore also play a role in maintaining static wrist postures.
Posture dependent activation levels may be attributed to the altered tension of the extrinsic finger
muscles caused by lengthening of muscles and tendons during different wrist postures, which change
the force necessary to make such movements. The increased passive force of the extrinsic finger
muscles when the is wrist extended and flexed has been previously documented . For example,
when the wrist is extended, the FDS and FDP muscles are lengthened, which generates an increased
flexion torque on the digits. The extensor digitorum and other assisting muscles must therefore
generate more force, and thus EMG activity, to counteract the increased tensions of the flexor muscles
both to maintain finger position and to perform extension movements. During finger flexion movements
while the wrist is still held extended, the lengthened finger flexor muscles generate substantial passive
forces that assist in flexion movements and therefore require less EMG activity to make a flexion
movement. This may also explain why the flexor compartments of the radial digits (FDS2, FDS3, FDP3)
had the lowest activation in the supinated posture, while the flexor compartments of the ulnar digits
(FDS4, FDP4, FDP5) were substantially more active in the same posture.
Despite the muscle compartments showing consistent patterns of responses, such as elevated EMG
activity of the finger extensors when the wrist was extended and lower activity when the wrist was
flexed (Fig. 3), there were differences in the magnitude of those responses across fingers. This may be
explained in part by the differences in passive forces generated by the individual compartments during
hand postures. The study by Keir et al. showed that passive muscle force differences of up to 200%
may occur between compartments of the same muscle, such as in the case of FDS2 and FDS4. It is
therefore plausible that the extrinsic finger muscle compartments exhibit some differences in response
magnitude based on wrist posture, but that the overall pattern of responses is maintained.
The accuracy of the classifiers used to determine wrist posture based on the integrated finger EMG
activity were significantly above chance, demonstrating that information regarding wrist posture can be
obtained from the extrinsic finger muscles. The high level of classifier accuracy for wrist postures in the
agonist direction (wrist extended for the finger extensors, flexed for the finger flexors) suggests that
information on wrist state can be gathered from the extrinsic finger muscles. However, information is
limited to this preferred direction, due to the poor performance in predicting neutral posture. The
performance of the classifiers is a reflection of the results reported in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4; all muscles
assessed showed at least some overlap between EMG activity in the neutral posture and the posture in
the opposite direction of the action (flexed for the finger extensors, extended for the finger flexors),
which caused difficulty in differentiating between these postures. Of the 11 muscles assessed, only 3
showed significant differences between EMG activity occurring in the neutral and antagonist postures,
making it difficult to effectively distinguish between those postures when all muscles are taken into
consideration. We chose to use separate classifiers rather than a single classifier to highlight the
strengths of the flexors and extensors for predicting wrist posture in the flexed and extended postures
respectively.
The shortcomings of the classification may also be attributed to using EMG activity of only extensor or
flexor muscle groups for prediction. Motor control of the hand requires the coordination of multiple

muscles for movements and stabilization of other joints. This holds direct implications for prosthetic
control algorithms and was experimentally shown by the increased performance of the regression
models that Smith et al. used for prosthetic control when they switched from using
agonist/antagonist muscle pairs for dual-site control to including all recorded muscles in every degreeof-freedom calculation. If the activity of more than just an agonist/antagonist pair is not taken into
account, there may be potential challenges in performing movements that use multiple degrees of
freedom. For example, the dual-site formula by Smith et al. with ED4 and FDS4 as inputs would see
three drastically different movements performed when the wrist was held extended, neutral, or flexed.
Depending on where the threshold was set, the predicted movement could be a quick burst or no
movement at all despite user intent of making a minor adjustment.
EMG activity was subject-dependent and found to be significant for nearly all muscles examined due to
high responders. Interestingly, the EMG activity patterns of high responders appeared to be limited to a
single muscle. For example, EDM of subject 10 showed high EMG activity during the extended posture
but low activity during the other postures (Fig. 3c). In the other muscles and movements of subject 10,
the EMG activity showed a range of responses similar to other subjects (Fig 3a-b, Fig 4a,f). Although high
responders had less pairwise differences in EMG activity due to posture, their performance still
demonstrates that EMG activity for movements is affected by wrist posture.
A core limitation of our work was that we were unable to determine how much the change in extrinsic
finger EMG activity based on posture was due to the necessity of overcoming mechanical coupling
effects, such as the changing passive forces of antagonist muscles lengthening, or a motor control
strategy in which the fingers assist in maintaining wrist posture. We are therefore unable to directly
ascribe whether this phenomenon is a reaction to passive forces or a method of control that uses
multiple muscles for force generation. Electrode placement was also a significant hurdle. Certain
muscles were more difficult to target due to anatomical constraints and we were ultimately unable to
successfully implant an electrode in ED3 due to the location of the posterior antebrachial cutaneous
nerve. Electrode placement in FDS4 and FDP4 also proved challenging. Four electrodes that were
targeted to FDP4 penetrated too deeply and were believed to be located in the flexor carpi ulnaris
muscle in post hoc experiment data analysis, as the electrodes showed no response to finger movement
but were active during wrist flexion and adduction. We were unable to determine whether this was due
to the small size of these muscles or electrode migration that may have occurred when subjects moved
their hands before testing. Only two electrodes generated high quality data from these muscles.
Another limitation on our work was the testing of pronation and supination postures. While we did test
finger movements in these wrist postures, we did not explore activity during pronation and supination
movements as thoroughly as Mogk et al. and it was difficult to draw meaningful conclusions on these
postures, as there did not seem to be a consistent behavior across the muscles examined.
Biomechanical models of the arm and hand may assist in understanding these postures, as the EMG
activity of the extrinsic finger muscles may be impacted by the changing muscle lengths and moment
arms which can be modeled in simulation software.
In this study we demonstrated that wrist posture significantly influences the necessary action of finger
muscles as demonstrated by the large changes in EMG activity of the extrinsic finger muscles in ablebodied subjects. Indeed, in certain cases, a three-fold change in finger muscle activity was required to
produce the same finger kinematics when the wrist was held in different postures. For the finger flexors,
these effects were most pronounced for muscles controlling the index finger. Future work could look to
investigate whether the effects of wrist posture on finger muscle activity are still present in traumatic
transradial amputees where these mechanical influences are removed, which could clarify whether

during rest before (left) and after (right) electromagnetic noise removal. Blocked in red are examples of
electromagnetic artifacts introduced by the kinematic tracking system and the signal after removal. Left: EMG
activity after high pass filtering to remove DC offset and motion artifacts. The artifacts may be observed boxed in
red. Right: The same EMG activity after electromagnetic noise removal. A scaled signal has been subtracted from
the signal while preserving the EMG activity present during the same time period. b) D2 MCP joint velocity and

Figure 5. Normalized integrated EMG activity for a) finger extensors (N=22) and b) finger flexors (N=28) during

wrist extension and flexion movements in flat and fist postures. For each subject, 10 repetitions were performed
for movements in each posture. The red line shows the median, and the outer boxes are the first and third
quartile. Error bars represent the 5-95% confidence interval. All posture and movement combination showed
significant differences (p<.005, Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn post-hoc testing).

Figure 6. Confusion matrices and true class accuracy for the linear discriminant classifiers for the a) finger
extensors and b) finger flexors. The diagonal of the matrices shows the percent of correct predictions (true positive
rate); the other percentages in each row are the incorrect predictions of other hand postures (false positives). a)
The finger extensors show the highest accuracy (86.9%) for detection of the extended wrist posture, and the
lowest accuracy (32.7%) for neutral posture. The most common misclassification for the neutral posture was for
the wrist flexed posture. For the finger extensors, the differences in EMG activity for flexed and neutral postures
were minor and only significant for ED4, which may be the driving cause of this error. b) The finger flexors show
similar results as the extensors, but with lower overall accuracy. Prediction of the flexed posture was the highest at
66.4%, followed by extended posture at 54.8%. Neutral posture classification had the lowest accuracy at 22.5%.
