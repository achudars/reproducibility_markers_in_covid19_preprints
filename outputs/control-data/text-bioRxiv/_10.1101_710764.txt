ABSTRACT
A single dose of potassium iodide (KI) against repeated exposure to radioactive iodine, such
as the one of the Fukushima accident, might not be effective enough to protect the thyroid.
Our group showed that repetitive dose of KI for eight days offers efficient protection without
toxic effects in adult rats. However, the effect of repetitive KI on the developing foetus still
unknown especially on brain development, but a correlation between the impaired maternal
thyroid status and a decrease in intelligence quotient has been observed. In this study, gene
expression analysis of the progeny of repetitive KI-administered pregnant rats performed by
our group showed distinct gene expression profile from two different organs: thyroid and
cortex. To understand how these differentially expressed genes are implicated in the observed
behaviour change, a systems biology approach was used to construct networks using three
different techniques; Bayesian statistics using ShrinkNet, sPLS-DA on the DIABLO platform
using mixOmics and manual construction of a Process Descriptive network. For each organ,
we were able to construct gene expression network, to select genes that are most contributing
to either control or KI-treated groups, respectively, and to construct the PD network from
differentially expressed (DE) gene enriched with data from publications. Furthermore, we
were able to connect DE genes from both organs into one network with genes from both
organ participating in the same cellular processes that affect mitophagy and neuronal
outgrowth.
This work may help to evaluate the doctrine for using KI in case of repetitive or prolonged
exposure to radioactive particles upon nuclear accidents.

1 INTRODUCTION
During a nuclear emergency, large quantities of radioactive particles may be released in a

plume

contaminating

the

environment

and

populations

likely

to

be

exposed.

Isotopes

present in the discharges include radioactive iodine-131 (

I). Exposure of populations to

radioactive iodine may be responsible in the absence of appropriate protective measures for

the increase in risk for late-onset thyroid

cancers, particularly in children, such as been

observed in the territories most affected by the fallout from the Chernobyl accident

1

or the

2

Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing .

To

prevent health consequences, protective actions

during the early phase of a nuclear

emergency are recommended, including population sheltering, Iodine Thyroid Blocking (ITB)

3

provision, evacuation and restrictions on the consumption of water or agricultural products .

The objective of this ITB is to saturate the thyroid gland with non-radioactive iodine and thus

avoid the fixation of radioactive iodine (Wolff-Chaikoff effect) .

They were housed individually upon arrival and allowed to recover from transportation for

one week. Rats were kept in regular light/dark schedule (12h/12h), at 21 ± 2°C and 50 ± 10%

humidity. Food 0.3 mg I / kg of pellet (A04-10 SAFE, Augy, France) and water were freely

accessible. After birth and weaning, male pups were randomly separated from their mother

almost one pup from each mother to avoid inbreeding bias. After that, they were divided

into control progeny not exposed in utero to KI, and treated progeny exposed in utero to KI,

each group include fourteen animals. Thirty days after the weaning, thyroid and cerebral

cortex progeny were collected and instantly deep-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored

at -80°C.

. DIABLO constructs components across the cortex and thyroid transcriptomics

matrices, maximizing their covariance given a control or KI treatment group as a response

variable. These components are defined as linear combinations of transcriptomics variables

and a L1 penalization ensures their sparsity. In all the analyses (inter and intra organ), Leave-

One-Out Cross validation was used to determine the model parameters including number of

components and number of features per component.

The results were carried out in order to obtain a relevance network (Correlation threshold =

0.82) using the “network” command and permits the selected features representation and

highlight positive or negative association in the within/between organ connections.

Colouring molecules in the PD network according to gene expression:

The genes that are differentially regulated (transcriptomic analysis) and are present in the

PD network can be coloured according to their log2 FC values by using the Cytoscape plugin

with Cytoscape v2.8. With the BiNoM plugin the CellDesigner file can be loaded into

Cytoscape environment and colours can be assigned to genes and proteins according to their

fold change.

3 RESULTS
Gene expression profile for the thyroid and cortex:

Transcriptomic analysis revealed 60 and 94 annotated transcripts for the thyroid and cortex,

respectively (t-test, Q-value < 0.05) (Figure 1). Certain functions could be associated to these

genes including site-specific DNA binding, ATP binding, transcription from the thyroid and

transcription regulation, DNA, RNA and ATP binding, nucleotide binding and neurogenesis

for the cortex (Table 1 in the supplementary materials). These lists of transcripts or genes

were used to construct a network to attempt finding a molecular mechanism. The heat map

showed a distinct difference in gene expression between the control and the KI-exposed

group.

thyroid (1A) and the cortex (1B). The progeny have been divided into two groups; one group
exposed i n utero to KI treatment while the control group was not exposed to KI i n u t e r o .
Figure 1A shows a heat map of DE genes and some of their associated function and cellular
localisation of genes obtained from the thyroid. Figure 1B shows a heat map of DE genes and

Network inference for the thyroid upon repetitive KI treatment:
Bayesian statistics showed that the 60 transcripts/genes from the thyroid can be connected
into four major sub-networks and few genes (nodes) that connect to many other nodes,
many nodes that connect to a few nodes (Figure 2A).
This inferred network gave indications for constructing a PD network e.g. which proteins
might interact with other molecules. How many different un-related processes might be
present? The colour code indicated a log2 fold change of the genes in the KI-treated group
compared to the control. Genes for the constructing the PD network were prioritised: sPLSDA method was applied to obtain genes that contribute to the different phenotypes (control

corresponding protein (coloured-code boxes) were present that could be associated with

ATP- and DNA-binding, transcription function and gene products that could be associated

with membrane and mitochondrion (Figure 2A). Other DE genes and their proteins were

a

was

constructed (Figure 4C). The networks showed a process descriptive diagram constituted of

genes that were differential regulated in either the cortex or thyroid. One process that was

of particular interest was the activation of Chrm2/3 complex by acetylcholine that lead to

activation of the ERK transcription factor (TF) which in turns increased transcription of the

Sox9 TF. Sox9 induced the transcription of gas7 and the GAS7 protein with the WASL protein

In

in mitochondrial function and mitophagy.

Figure 4A. ShrinkNet network of DE genes obtained from thyroid and cortex respectively.
There are edges present that show correlation between expression of genes within the same
organ (thyroid or cortex) but there are also edges present showing correlation between genes
from both organs. In addition, there are genes present from one organ that either do not have
edges to genes of the other organ or do not have edges to genes that have edges to genes of
the other organ (nodes that are outside the circle).

Figure 4B. The DIABLO inferred gene network is represented as a circle where the red part of
the circle represents the thyroid with genes that contribute strongly to the separation of the
control group and the KI exposed group. The purple part of the circle represents the cortex
with genes that contribute strongly to the separation of the KI group and the control group.
The edges show correlation (with a cut-off of r=0.82) between genes that can be either
negative (black colour) or positive (orange colour). These genes can be used as a starting
point for creating the PD network (figure 4C).

the interaction between these genes and their corresponding proteins and the interaction
with other molecules is obtained from published articles. This figure demonstrates molecular
mechanisms between genes from two different organs that impact neuronal outgrowth, and
action potential in neurons and mitochondrial function and mitophagy (Ochre coloured

4. DISCUSSION
The Fukushima disaster with repetitive release of radionucleotides in the atmosphere has

revealed the limitation of a strategy based on a single ITB may not be sufficient to protect

the thyroid. The established doctrine of single ITB needs to be evaluated in case of repetitive

releases of radionucleotides and indeed repetitive or multiple doses of ITB protects against

The molecular mechanisms that drive these AO are currently unknown and need further

investigation to propose adapted/optimised KI administration. The application of systems

.

In this study we have focussed on the thyroid and cortex as these organs are the major

32,33

target organs during embryonal development

. Indeed, for the cortex and thyroid, distinct

gene expression profiles between the control and KI-treated groups have been observed

even at 51 days after birth, while in adult rat no difference in gene expression between the

The gene expression profile for the cortex has shown that DE genes are associated with DNA

Indeed, network construction is a well-established method to asses patho-physiology

We have taken advantage of different methods for constructing a network i.e. ShrinkNet and

sPLS-DA/Diablo.

are

Due

less

to

its

complexity (many more connections compared to the thyroid network) it is more difficult to

find genes that may lead to synthetic lethality

43

and therefore this network is more robust

against deregulation of homeostasis than the thyroid one. Because the thyroid network is

less robust, it is easier to modulate this network e.g. a low dosage KI may have a major

impact on thyroid hormone synthesis and this has in turn a major effect on the development

of the cortex

44

.

The obtained networks show connections between genes in terms of statistical correlations.

The CellDesigner software permits to add a plausible and biochemical interpretation to the

inferred network. The PD network of the thyroid has shown that the observed DE genes may

the DE genes from both the cortex and the thyroid into one network which suggests: (i)

cortex to thyroid connection through chrm2 to gas7; (ii) thyroid to cortex through tomm70a
