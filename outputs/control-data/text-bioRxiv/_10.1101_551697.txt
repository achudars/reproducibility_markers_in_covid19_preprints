Abstract
Microglia rapidly respond to changes in neural activity and inflammation to regulate synaptic
connectivity. The extracellular signals, particularly neuron-derived molecules, that drive these
microglial functions at synapses remains a key open question. Here, whisker lesioning, known
to dampen cortical activity, induces microglia-mediated synapse elimination. We show that this
synapse elimination is dependent on the microglial fractalkine receptor, CX3CR1, but not
complement receptor 3, signaling. Further, mice deficient in the CX3CR1 ligand (CX3CL1) also
have profound defects in synapse elimination. Single-cell RNAseq then revealed that Cx3cl1 is
cortical neuron-derived and ADAM10, a metalloprotease that cleaves CX3CL1 into a secreted
form, is upregulated specifically in layer IV neurons and microglia following whisker lesioning.
Finally, inhibition of ADAM10 phenocopies Cx3cr1-/- and Cx3cl1-/- synapse elimination defects.
Together, these results identify novel neuron-to-microglia signaling necessary for cortical
synaptic remodeling and reveal context-dependent immune mechanisms are utilized to remodel
synapses in the mammalian brain.

INTRODUCTION
Microglia are constant surveyors of their extracellular environment and dynamic
regulators of synaptic connectivity. Among the recently identified functions of microglia at
synapses is developmental synaptic pruning, whereby microglia are, in fact, ‘listening’ to circuit
activity and engulfing synapses from less active neurons1,2. There has also been recent work in
the context of the inflamed central nervous system (CNS) where microglia engulf and eliminate
synapses during neurodegeneration3-5, suggesting that similar developmental mechanisms are
upregulated at the wrong time and place during disease. Mechanisms regulating this process of
microglia-mediated synapse elimination in health and disease have largely focused on surface
receptors expressed by microglia. Whether there are neuronal cues that instruct microglia to
eliminate synapses remains an open question. Given the large array of neurological disorders
that implicate microglia-mediated synapse elimination as a regulator of synaptic connectivity,
understanding the underlying neuron-microglia signaling will be critical going forward.
Two of the major molecular pathways identified to modulate microglia function at
synapses are phagocytic signaling through complement receptor 3 (CR3) and chemokine
signaling through the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1). In the developing mouse visual thalamus,
complement proteins C3 and C1q localize to synapses and microglia engulf synapses via CR3
expressed by microglia1,6,7. Blocking this synaptic engulfment in C3, C1q, or CR3-deficient mice
results in sustained synaptic pruning defects. Similar complement-dependent mechanisms of
synapse elimination have been identified in mouse models of neurodegeneration3-5. CX3CR1 is
a G-protein coupled chemokine receptor highly enriched in microglia8. While CR3-dependent
phagocytic signaling regulates synaptic pruning in the developing visual system, studies have
demonstrated that these effects are independent of CX3CR19,10. Instead, in the developing
hippocampus and barrel cortex, CX3CR1-deficient mice exhibit a transient delay in microglial
recruitment to synapse-dense brain regions and a concomitant delay in functional maturation of

synapses11,12. Long term, CX3CR1-deficient mice demonstrate defects in social interactions
and functional synaptic connectivity13. How CX3CR1 deficiency is exerting these effects and the
relative involvement of its canonical ligand fractalkine (CX3CL1) are unknown.
In the current study, we used the mouse barrel cortex system to identify mechanisms by
which neurons communicate with microglia to regulate synapse remodeling. Sensory endings
from trigeminal neurons innervate the whisker follicles on the snout. Sensory information from
each whisker is then transmitted to the brain stem, then to the ventral posteromedial (VPM)
nucleus of the thalamus, and ultimately to the cortex via thalamocortical (TC) synapses, which
terminate largely in layer IV of the barrel cortex. This is a particularly powerful system for
studying synapse remodeling as each whisker corresponds to an individual bundle of TC inputs
(i.e. barrels) separated by septa, which, despite being several synapses away, are highly
sensitive to manipulation of the whiskers14,15. Indeed, removal of the whiskers in this system
results in dampened activity in the cortex and elimination of TC synapses16-28. However, the
mechanism(s) by which changes in activity elicit TC synapse remodeling is in an open question.
To address these open questions, we used whisker cauterization and trimming in
developing mice, paradigms known to reduce activity in the corresponding barrel cortex16-28. We
identify synapse elimination within 1 week of whisker removal and robust microglia-mediated
synaptic engulfment. Unlike the developing visual system, synapse elimination in the barrel
cortex is CR3-independent. Instead, we identify profound defects in TC synapse elimination in
mice deficient in CX3CR1 enriched in microglia or its ligand CX3CL1. Using single-cell
sequencing, we further uncover that CX3CL1 is enriched in cortical neurons, but its transcription
is not modulated by sensory lesioning. Instead, ADAM10, a metalloprotease known to cleave
CX3CL1 into a secreted form is increased in layer IV neurons and microglia. Strikingly,
pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 phenocopies defects in sensory lesion-induced TC
synapse remodeling in CX3CL1 and CX3CR1-deficient mice. This suggests that post-

translational modification of neuronal CX3CL1 by ADAM10 following loss of sensory input
directs microglia to eliminate synapses. Together, these data provide new insight into molecular
mechanisms by which neurons communicate with microglia and direct them to engulf and
remove synapses. Our single-cell RNAseq further provides an unbiased approach to identify
novel mechanisms regulating neuron-microglia communication in response to sensory
perturbations. We also demonstrate that distinct immune signaling pathways are engaged by
microglia to remodel synapses in different contexts and, in the process, uncover a new
molecular pathway regulating remodeling of TC synapses.
RESULTS
Whisker lesioning induces rapid and robust elimination of thalamocortical inputs in the
barrel cortex
To interrogate neuron-microglia signaling regulating synapse remodeling, we performed
two different manipulations in separate cohorts of postnatal day 4 (P4) mice, unilateral whisker
trimming and unilateral whisker lesioning by cauterization (P4; Fig. 1 and Supplemental Fig.1ab). These paradigms are known to reduce activity in the barrel cortex and maximize robust TC
remodeling in the neonate while avoiding the critical window (P0-P3) where sensory loss
disrupts initial TC input wiring and can induce neuronal apoptosis in the barrel cortex16-18,28.
Also, each model has its own internal control as the whiskers are left intact on the other side of
the snout. Using anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) immunostaining, we observed
a decrease in TC presynaptic terminals within layer IV of the barrel cortex by 17 days-post the
beginning of the whisker trimming paradigm (Supplemental Fig.1a-b). These results are
consistent with previous work showing decreased TC inputs within the barrel cortex following
whisker trimming in neonates and adults21,22,27. This decrease in presynaptic terminals was
accelerated in the whisker lesioning model where, within 6 days, VGluT2 immunoreactivity was

decreased by ~75% in the deprived compared to the control barrel cortex within the same
animal (Fig. 1b-c). Demonstrating that these results were not due to a downregulation of
VGluT2, we observed similar effects in mice that express a fluorescent reporter in thalamic
neurons and their cortical projections (SERT-Cre; Rosa26LSL.TdTomato/+) (Supplementary Fig. 1cd). To note, presynaptic terminals and axons are labeled with tdTomato as well as other cortical
projections besides TC synapses in SERT-Cre;Rosa26LSL.TdTomato/+ mice, resulting in less robust
detection of synapse elimination compared to analyses with VGluT2, a more specific marker for
TC presynaptic terminals.
To determine if TC synapse elimination induced by whisker lesioning was an indirect
effect, due to neuronal damage and loss, we also assessed cell death, axon degeneration, and
cell stress. We observed no significant increase in cleaved Caspase3+ neurons or amyloid
precursor protein (APP) accumulation in axons within the barrel cortex circuit following whisker
removal (Supplementary Figure 2d-f). These analyses included neurons within the VPM nucleus
of the thalamus, cortical neurons within the barrel cortex, and trigeminal neurons, which
innervate the whisker follicle. However, an increase in the stress marker ATF3 was observed in
trigeminal neurons (Supplementary Fig. 2a-b), but not in cortical or VPM neurons
(Supplementary Fig. 2c). To further characterize the system, we performed bulk RNAseq of the
barrel cortex following whisker lesioning. Consistent with decreased activity in the barrel cortex,
immediate early genes such as Fos and genes related to neurotransmitter signaling were
decreased in the deprived barrel cortex with no apparent increase in genes related to cell stress
or death (Fig. 1d-f; Fig. 8j-k). Instead, there was an increase in genes related to axon growth
and phagocytic signaling. These data are most consistent with synapse loss resulting from
decreased activity in the barrel cortex circuit vs. injury-induced inflammation and degeneration.
Given the rapid and robust presynaptic terminal loss elicited in the absence of significant

neuronal cell death or degeneration, we proceeded with whisker cauterization-induced sensory
lesioning in P4 mice as a model for the remainder of the study.
Whisker lesioning induces microglial engulfment of TC inputs within the barrel cortex
independent of complement receptor 3 (CR3)
In the developing visual system, microglia engulf and remove synapses in response to
dampened neural activity1,2,29. Therefore, we next explored whether microglia similarly engulf
and eliminate TC synaptic inputs in the barrel cortex following whisker lesioning. Microglia were
labeled using a transgenic mouse that expresses EGFP under the control of the fractalkine
receptor (Cx3cr1EGFP/+)30 and TC presynaptic terminals were labeled using an anti-VGluT2
antibody. Using fluorescent confocal microscopy and structured illumination microscopy, we
detected an ~2-fold increase in the volume of engulfed TC inputs within microglia in the
deprived barrel cortex within 24 h of removing the whiskers (Fig. 1g-o and Supplementary Fig.
3a)1,31. These inputs were largely localized within the microglia, but not yet significantly
associated with lysosomes (Fig. 1g-i). Interestingly, at 5 days-post whisker removal, microglia
had a more phagocytic morphology, with a more rounded and enlarged soma, and most
engulfed TC inputs were completely localized within microglial lysosomes in the deprived barrel
cortex (Fig. 1k-o). In contrast, minimal TC inputs were detected within microglia or microglial
lysosomes in the control barrel cortex of the same animal at any time point assessed (Fig. 1h,j).
In addition, we observed, not only an increase in the amount of synaptic material engulfed, but
the percentage of highly phagocytic microglia (phagocytic index >1% at 24 h and >2% at 5d)
was also increased in the deprived cortex (Supplementary Fig. 3). This increase in phagocytic
activity was further reflected in our RNAseq data (Fig. 1e-f). These data provide the first
evidence that microglia engulf and eliminate TC inputs in the cortex several synapses away
from a peripheral sensory lesion known to reduce activity in the cortex.

One of the best characterized mechanisms utilized by microglia to engulf and remodel
synapses is complement-dependent phagocytic signaling1,6,7. During synaptic pruning in the
developing mouse visual system, complement proteins C1q and C3 localize to synapses.
Microglia subsequently engulf and eliminate these synapses via the microglial phagocytic
receptor complement receptor 3 (CR3/CD11b). To determine whether this pathway also
regulates microglia-mediated synapse elimination in the barrel cortex following whisker
lesioning, we assessed microglial engulfment and elimination of TC inputs in CR3-deficient
(CR3-KO) mice. Surprisingly, TC inputs were eliminated appropriately by 6 days-post whisker
removal in CR3-KO mice (Fig. 2a-c) and engulfed TC inputs were detected within microglia in
the deprived barrel cortex (Fig. 2d-f), as described above for wild-type mice (Fig. 1). Together,
these data demonstrate that CR3 is dispensable for sensory lesion-induced microglial
engulfment and elimination of TC synapses in the barrel cortex.
CX3CR1-deficient mice have profound defects in structural and functional synapse
remodeling following whisker lesioning
Because of the surprising result that microglial engulfment and elimination of TC inputs
in the barrel cortex was CR3-independent, we next explored other candidate mechanisms.
Besides CR3, the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1), a G-protein coupled chemokine receptor
highly enriched in microglia, has also been implicated in regulating microglial function at
developing synapses11-13. We, therefore, sought to assess whisker lesion-induced TC synapse
remodeling in Cx3cr1-/- mice. Remarkably, unlike CR3-KO mice (Fig. 2), elimination of VGluT2positive TC presynaptic inputs and structural synapses (co-localized presynaptic VGluT2 and
postsynaptic Homer puncta) 6 days-post whisker removal was completely blocked in Cx3cr1-/mice compared to Cx3cr1+l- or Cx3cr1+l+ littermates (Fig. 3). This was largely a presynaptic
effect as the density of postsynaptic Homer-positive immunoreactivity was relatively unaffected
6 days-post whisker removal, even in wild-type animals (Fig. 3h-i,l). This is consistent with

previous work demonstrating that microglia preferentially engulf presynaptic inputs1,32. We
further measured macrophage recruitment to the whisker follicles following whisker lesioning as
well as immunostaining for ATF3 in Cx3cr1-/- mice (Supplementary Fig. 4). All these responses
were comparable to Cx3cr1+l- controls (Supplementary Fig. 2). Last, we assessed TC input
elimination following whisker trimming and found that TC input elimination elicited in this
paradigm was also CX3CR1-dependent (Supplementary Fig. 4f-g). Together, these results
suggest that synapse elimination defects in Cx3cr1-/- mice were not secondary to changes in
injury, wound healing, or neuronal stress responses.
To further determine if CX3CR1-dependent defects in TC input elimination are longlasting, we lesioned whiskers at P4 and then assessed structural and functional remodeling at
≥6 weeks of age (Fig. 4). Similar to 6 days post-whisker removal, we observed a significant
decrease in structural TC inputs in the deprived adult (P90) Cx3cr1+/+ barrel cortex (Fig. 4a),
which was blocked in Cx3cr1-/- mice (Fig.4b). To determine whether structural synapse
remodeling defects translated to changes in functional connectivity, we next performed
electrophysiological recordings in ≥6 week Cx3cr1-/- and Cx3cr1+l+ mice. We observed a
significant decrease in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) frequency and
amplitude in layer IV stellate neurons within the deprived cortex in Cx3cr1+/+ mice (Fig. 4c-d),
which is consistent with a decrease in the number and strength of functional synapses in the
deprived cortex. We then assessed the same parameters in Cx3cr1-/- littermates. Consistent
with our assessment of structural synapses, remodeling of functional synapses following
whisker lesioning was blocked in Cx3cr1-/- mice (Fig. 4c,e). There was no longer a significant
decrease in sEPSC frequency or amplitude in the deprived cortex compared to the control
cortex in Cx3cr1-/- mice. Interestingly, there was also a decrease in baseline sEPSC frequency
and amplitude in Cx3cr1-/- mice compared to Cx3cr1+/+ littermates, suggesting that CX3CR1
signaling may modulate this aspect of functional synapse development within the barrel cortex.

This is similar to previously published work showing that CX3CR1 deficiency results in a delay
in the functional maturation of synapses11,12. These data establish that microglial CX3CR1
signaling is critical for long-term remodeling of structural and functional synapses in the barrel
cortex several synapses away from a peripheral sensory lesion.
CX3CR1 signaling regulates microglia-mediated engulfment of TC synapses
While microglial CX3CR1 signaling has previously been identified to play an important
role in regulating synaptic connectivity11-13, the mechanism by which CX3CR1 exerts these
effects is largely unknown. It has been suggested that CX3CR1, a chemokine receptor, is
necessary for microglial recruitment to synapses. Similar to previously published work in the
barrel cortex12, we found that microglia in neonatal Cx3cr1+/- mice were concentrated in barrel
septa and infiltrated the barrel centers at P6-7 (Fig. 5a-b and Supplementary Fig. 5). This
recruitment to barrel centers was delayed in Cx3cr1-/- mice until P8 (Fig. 5a-b). There was no
overall difference in the total numbers of microglia in the Cx3cr1-/- vs. Cx3cr1+/- barrel cortices
(Supplementary Fig. 5). We then assessed whether microglial recruitment to barrel centers was
affected by whisker lesioning and identified that recruitment and overall density of microglia
were largely unaffected in Cx3cr1+/- and Cx3cr1-/- littermates (Fig. 5a-b, Supplementary Fig. 5).
There was still a transient delay in recruitment of microglia to barrel centers in Cx3cr1-/- barrel
cortex in both control and deprived barrel cortices; however, numbers of microglia within barrel
centers were indistinguishable from Cx3cr1+/- mice by P8. Given that the bulk of TC synapse
elimination occurs after P8 in the current paradigm (Fig. 1a-c), the delay in recruitment of
microglia to the barrel centers in <P8 Cx3cr1-/- mice likely does not explain the sustained defect
in synapse elimination in Cx3cr1-/- mice.
To more closely assess microglial-synapse interactions in Cx3cr1-/- mice in response to
whisker removal, we next analyzed microglia-mediated TC input engulfment. Unlike CR3-KO

mice (Fig. 2), loss of CX3CR1 completely blocked TC input engulfment by microglia in the
deprived barrel cortex (Fig. 5c-h). This engulfment was blocked at both P5 and P9. Together,
these data demonstrate that CX3CR1 signaling modulates microglia-mediated synaptic
engulfment and blockade of this engulfment results in sustained defects in structural and
functional synapse elimination following a peripheral sensory lesion.
The CX3CR1 ligand, fractalkine (CX3CL1), is necessary for microglial TC synaptic
engulfment and elimination following whisker lesioning.
We next sought to understand the signals upstream of CX3CR1 necessary for TC
synapse elimination by microglia and first assessed a role for fractalkine (CX3CL1), the
canonical ligand of CX3CR133. Unlike CX3CR1, the role of CX3CL1 in microglia-mediated
synapse development is largely unknown. Similar to Cx3cr1-/- mice, we observed significant
defects in the elimination of TC inputs 6 days post-whisker removal in the Cx3cl1-/- barrel cortex
(Fig. 6a-f). This synapse elimination defect was accompanied by a blockade of TC input
engulfment by microglia (Fig. 6g-i) in Cx3cl1-/- mice, which phenocopies defects in Cx3cr1-/mice. These data identify CX3CL1 as a novel regulator of TC synapse remodeling and
microglia-mediated engulfment of synapses and strongly suggest that microglia eliminate TC
inputs through CX3CR1-CX3CL1 signaling.
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that CX3CL1 is highly enriched in neurons in the
barrel cortex but its transcription is not modulated by whisker lesioning
To further explore the mechanism by which CX3CL1 signals to CX3CR1 to regulate TC
synapse elimination, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing in the deprived and nondeprived barrel cortices of Cx3cr1+/- and Cx3cr1-/- mice. Cx3cr1+/- mice were used as controls as
these were the animals used for initial synaptic remodeling and engulfment analyses (Fig. 1). 24

by microglia (Fig. 1), deprived and control barrel cortices were microdissected from each animal
and single-cell RNAseq was performed using inDrops34. Following principal component
analysis, we identified 27 distinct clusters of CNS cell types within the barrel cortex, which were
reproducible across biological replicates with an average read depth across biological replicates
of 8,815 reads per cell. (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Figs. 6-7). In agreement with a recent singlecell transcriptomic study in the adult visual cortex identifying changes in gene expression of
neuronal and non-neuronal cells in response to visual stimulation, we observed gene
expression changes in neurons and glia (Supplementary Figs. 8-9)35. To our knowledge, this is
the first analysis of sensory lesion and CX3CR1-dependent gene expression in the developing
somatosensory cortex at single-cell resolution. From this data set, we identified some
potentially interesting differences in glial cell, including microglial, gene expression following
whisker lesioning (Supplementary Fig. 9), which were largely blocked in Cx3cr1-/- mice
(Supplemental Fig. 9a,h). To note, compared to neurons, the numbers of glial cells sequenced
was relatively low for individual genotypes (Supplemental Fig. 9g). Therefore, future
investigation to validate gene expression in changes in glial cell types is necessary. Going
forward, we focused our analyses on whisker lesion-induced changes in gene expression in
neuronal populations.
Similar to previous work33, we observed enrichment of Cx3cl1 mRNA in neurons
compared to non-neuronal (Fig. 7b-c). However, despite CX3CL1 being necessary for TC input
remodeling following whisker lesioning (Fig. 6), we found no significant difference in Cx3cl1
mRNA in the deprived vs. control barrel cortex in any cell type (Fig. 7c). These data were
confirmed by in situ hybridization (Fig. 7d-e). This was further confirmed by RNAseq of whole
barrel cortex (Fig 1e) and qPCR from the barrel cortex and VPM nucleus of the thalamus (Fig
7f-g). These data demonstrate that CX3CL1 is neuron-derived, but its transcription in the barrel
cortex and thalamus is unchanged following peripheral sensory lesioning.

ADAM10, a metalloprotease that cleaves CX3CL1, is increased in neurons and microglia
within the barrel cortex following whisker lesioning
CX3CL1 can exist in a membrane or a secreted form33. The latter is produced upon
cleavage of the membrane-bound form by metalloproteases36. Therefore, we hypothesized that
this post-translational processing of CX3CL1, versus its transcription, was modified upon
whisker lesioning. After analyzing gene expression in all 27 cell clusters within our single-cell
data set, we identified Adam10, a metalloprotease previously shown to be regulated by
neuronal activity37 and known to cleave CX3CL136,38 (Fig. 8a), as specifically increased in Rorb+
layer IV neurons and microglia upon whisker lesioning (Fig. 8b-c and Supplementary Fig. 8). No
other cell populations within our single-cell data set showed significant changes in Adam10
expression. We validated these single-cell data and demonstrated that Adam10 mRNA
increases in Rorb+ layer IV neurons in the deprived barrel cortex relative to control by in situ
hybridization (Fig.8d-e). We then assessed microglial Adam10 expression by in situ in the barrel
cortex (Fig. 8g-i). Similar to analysis of Rorb+ neurons (Fig. 8e), we averaged the data across
all the microglia, but this analysis revealed no significant difference in total microglial Adam10
expression following whisker lesioning (Fig. 8h). However, we observed a subset of microglia
within our images that appeared to have high Adam10 in the deprived cortex (Fig. 8g).
Therefore, we binned the data based on Adam10 puncta per cell and found that microglia with
the highest expression of Adam10 (>15 puncta/cell) were significantly increased in the deprived
vs. control barrel cortex (Fig. 8i). To further validate this upregulation of Adam10, we performed
qPCR from whole barrel cortex and observed a similar increase in total Adam10 mRNA 24 h
post-whisker lesioning (Fig. 8f). Analysis of bulk RNAseq from whole barrel cortex (Fig. 1d-f)
showed a similar effect (Fig 8j-k). These RNAseq data also revealed increases in molecules
known to interact with and regulate ADAM10 activity at the membrane (e.g., tetraspanins
(Tspn5 and Tspn14); Fig 8k). These data demonstrate that ADAM10, a protease that cleaves

CX3CL1 into a secreted form, is induced largely in layer IV excitatory neurons and a subset of
microglia within the barrel cortex upon sensory lesioning.
Pharmacological inactivation of ADAM10 phenocopies TC synapse elimination defects in
Cx3cr1-/- and Cx3cl1-/- mice
To then determine if induction of Adam10 in response to whisker lesioning translated to
circuit level changes in TC synapse remodeling as observed in Cx3cr1-/- and Cx3cl1-/- mice, we
pharmacologically inhibited ADAM10. Whiskers were lesioned at P4 and a pharmacological
inhibitor of ADAM10 (GI254023X , 25 mg/kg), which has been previously been demonstrated in
vivo to cross the blood brain barrier and specifically inhibit ADAM10 vs. other ADAMs39-41, was
administered intraperitoneally (IP) daily starting at the time of whisker lesioning (Fig. 9a). TC
synapse engulfment and elimination were subsequently assessed in the control and deprived
barrel cortices. Identical to Cx3cr1-/- and Cx3cl1-/- mice, daily administration of the ADAM10
inhibitor (25mg/kg) by IP injection (P4-P10) resulted in profound disruption of TC input
elimination following whisker cauterization (Fig. 9b-c). This was concomitant with a blockade of
microglia-mediated engulfment of TC inputs (Fig. 9d-i). These data suggest a mechanism by
which post-translational modification of CX3CL1 by ADAM10 is increased in neurons following
sensory lesioning, which is known to decrease activity in the barrel cortex. This secreted
CX3CL1 then signals to microglia via CX3CR1 to eliminate synapses.
DISCUSSION
We have identified a novel mechanism by which neurons signal to microglia to remodel
synapses in response to a changing sensory environment. Following whisker lesioning,
microglia engulf TC inputs in the barrel cortex, which is blocked in CX3CR1 and CX3CL1deficient mice. Importantly, loss of CX3CR1 signaling, but not CR3, results in sustained defects
in the elimination of structural and functional synapses following whisker lesioning. Using single

cell RNAseq analysis, we then identify that Cx3cl1 is expressed primarily by neurons. Moreover,
Adam10, a gene encoding a metalloprotease known to cleave CX3CL1 into a secreted form, is
specifically induced in layer IV excitatory neurons and a subset of microglia upon sensory
lesioning. As the first single-cell transcriptomic study in the developing barrel cortex, this is a
rich dataset and likely a valuable resource for assessing gene expression in glia and neurons.
As validation of one gene hit, we demonstrate using 3 additional methods that Adam10 mRNA
is increased upon whisker lesioning, the mRNA of known regulators of ADAM10 are also
modulated following whisker lesioning, and pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 phenocopies
TC synapse elimination defects observed in CX3CR1 and CX3CL1-deficient mice. Together,
our data suggest a mechanism by which post-translational processing of CX3CL1 in neurons by
ADAM10 is regulated by changes in network activity following a peripheral sensory lesion and
subsequently cleaved CX3CL1 signals to microglia to engulf and eliminate synapses via a
CX3CR1-dependent mechanism. These data suggest an active process of microglia-mediated
TC input elimination as blocking engulfment results in defects in sustained increases in
structural and functional synapses. Importantly, we have identified a novel mechanism of
neuron-microglia communication that, upon a peripheral sensory lesion several synapses away,
leads to the remodeling and elimination of thalamocortical synapses.
Published studies have identified that microglia contact and/or engulf synaptic elements
and these interactions are activity-dependent1,2,29,42-49. However, the mechanisms underlying
these activity-dependent microglia-synapse interactions and the neuron-derived signals driving
this process remain largely unknown. Another transcriptional profiling study has demonstrated
that, under basal conditions, microglia express a number of transcripts for sensing endogenous
ligands and microbes, which was termed the ‘sensome50.’ Our data provide a role for one key
microglial ‘sensome’ gene Cx3cr1 in microglia-mediated synapse elimination following
manipulation of circuit activity via whisker lesioning or trimming. This is consistent with previous

work demonstrating roles for CX3CR1 in modulating microglial function at synapses during
development and after seizures11-13 49. Our work provides important mechanistic insight into how
CX3CR1 is regulating microglial function at synapses and identifies a new role for neuronderived CX3CL1 and ADAM10 in this process. Going forward, it will be important to elucidate
precisely how ADAM10 is modulated in neurons and microglia following sensory lesioning. Also,
developing new tools to monitor CX3CL1 cleavage in specific cells will be another important
future direction.
This study also raises a new question regarding how downstream CX3CR1 signaling is
regulating microglial engulfment and synapse elimination. Our single-cell data set provide some
evidence that there is a downregulation of genes related to phagocytosis in Cx3cr1-/- microglia,
even without whisker lesioning (Supplementary Fig. 10). This raises the possibility that CX3CR1
signaling could modulate basal phagocytic state of microglia through changes in gene
expression. In addition, by our single-cell analyses, microglia, as well as other glia, appear to
modify their gene expression in response to sensory lesioning. While these gene expression
changes require further validation, this is an exciting first step in understanding how microglia
respond to a changing sensory environment. We have evidence that these lesion-induced
microglial gene expression changes are dramatically modified by loss of CX3CR1. Therefore,
another exciting future direction is to further elucidate these CX3CR1-dependent gene
expression changes.
Another important theme that emerges from our data is that different neural-immune
signaling mechanisms are utilized by microglia to engulf and remodel synaptic connections and
these mechanisms appear to be engaged in a context-dependent manner. One recent study in
the developing rodent spinal cord has shown a role for astrocytic IL-33 in mediating microglial
synapse engulfment through IL1RL151. Work in the developing mouse retinogeniculate identified
complement-dependent phagocytic signaling as a key regulator of microglial engulfment and

elimination of synapses undergoing developmental pruning1,6,7 and microglial P2RY12 was
identified as a key regulator of ocular dominance plasticity in the visual cortex29. These findings
are in line with seminal work discovering that MHC class I molecules, another immune pathway,
are critical regulators of synapse development and plasticity in the visual system52-54.
Interestingly, retinogeniculate pruning and ocular dominance plasticity occur independent of
CX3CR19,10. In contrast, we show that sensory deprivation-induced elimination of synapses in
the barrel cortex is regulated by CX3CR1-CX3CL1 signaling, but not CR3. These data
demonstrate that distinct immune mechanisms are utilized to regulate synaptic remodeling
depending on the circuit and/or paradigm used for manipulating activity. For example, the
whisker lesioning paradigm used here induces injury to the peripheral sensory endings in the
snout several synapses away from the barrel cortex. Therefore, this may be an injury vs.
activity-dependent response. However, there are several lines of evidence arguing against this
being an injury response. First, there is no change in neuronal cell death or degeneration
following whisker lesioning. Second, there is a similar, albeit delayed, CX3CR1-depenedent
synapse elimination following whisker trimming. Last, our RNAseq data demonstrate there is a
downregulation in genes related to neural activity, but, besides genes related to phagocytosis,
no genes associated with injury or inflammation. These data are most consistent with cortical
activity modulating CX3CR1-CX3CL1 signaling via ADAM10 and microglia-mediated synapse
elimination.
A broad range of neurological disorders from autism and schizophrenia to traumatic
injuries causing loss of eye sight, cutaneous sensation, olfaction or hearing all result in changes
in sensory inputs and TC connectivity55-60. Further, defects in CX3CR1-CX3CL1 signaling and
ADAM10 have been identified to either enhance or suppress neurodegeneration in a variety of
neurological disease models depending on the disease, insult, brain region, etc.38,61-66. Here, we
identify that neuronal ADAM10 is modulated in the cortex by sensory lesioning and disruption of

ADAM10, CX3CL1 (an ADAM10 substrate), or CX3CR1 results in profound defects in microglial
synaptic engulfment and synapse elimination following a peripheral sensory lesion known to
dampen activity in the cortex38,64-66. This mechanism is particularly intriguing in light of recent
data in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease where changes in neural activity modulates
microglial morphology, Aβ, and amyloid plaques67,68. One exciting possibility is that activity
dependent CX3CR1-CX3CL1-ADAM10 signaling could be involved in modulating plaque
pathology via microglia. Together, our findings have strong implications for advancing our
understanding of how microglia and CX3CR1-CX3CL1-ADAM10 signaling affect brain circuits
and provide novel insight into how TC circuits remodel in the cortex. These insights are
important for our basic understanding of how neurons communicate with microglia to modulate
neural circuits and have significant translational potential for a variety of neurological disorders
with underlying changes in synaptic connectivity, microglia, and fractalkine signaling.

Materials and Methods

Animals
SERT-Cre mice were a generous gift from Dr. Mark Ansorage, Columbia University and
provided by Dr. Sacha Nelson, Brandeis University. Cx3cl1-/- mice were provided by Dr. Sergio
Lira (Ichan School of Medicine, Mount Sinai). Rosa26-TdTomato mice (Ai14; stock #007914),
Cx3cr1-/- mice (Cx3cr1EGFP/EGFP; stock #005582), CR3-KO mice (stock #003991), and C57Bl6/J
(stock #000664) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).
Heterozygous breeder pairs were set up for all experiments and wild-type and heterozygote
littermates were used as controls with equal representation of males and females for each
genotype. All experiments were performed in accordance with animal care and use committees
and under NIH guidelines for proper animal welfare.

Whisker Removal
For sensory lesioning, whiskers were unilaterally removed at P4 with a high temperature
handheld cautery kit (Bovie Medical Corporation; Clearwater, FL) applied to the right whisker
pad of anesthetized pups. After whisker removal, pups were placed on a heating pad before
animals were returned to their home cage. For long term whisker deprivation, whiskers were
removed at P4 and assessed for whisker re-growth weekly. For whisker trimming experiments,
whiskers were unilaterally trimmed from the right whisker pad starting at P4. Whiskers were
trimmed twice daily to minimize whisker growth up to P21.

Immunohistochemistry
Animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB) prior to brain
removal. In order to visualize the entire barrel field in one plane, the midbrain was dissected
from each brain hemisphere and the cortex was then flattened between two slides in 4%

paraformaldehyde overnight. Sections were placed in 30% sucrose in 0.1M PB for 24 hours
before 50µm (P5-P11) and 40µm (>P40) tangential sections were prepared. Sections were
blocked in 10% goat serum, 0.01% TritonX-100 in 0.1M PB for 1 hour before primary
immunostaining antibodies were applied overnight. For analysis of synaptic engulfment within
microglia, anti-CD68 (AbD Serotec; Raleigh, NC) and anti-VGluT2 (MilliporeSigma; Darmstadt,
Germany) were used. Microglia were labeled either using transgenic expression of EGFP
(CX3CR1EGFP/+) or immunostaining for anti-Iba-1 (Wako Chemicals; Richmond, VA). For
analysis of synapse density, anti-VGluT2 (MilliporeSigma; Darmstadt, Germany) and antiHomer1

(Synaptic

Systems;

Goettingen,

Germany)

were

used.

For

markers

of

neurodegeneration, cell death, and cell stress, anti-APP (ThermoFisher Scientific; Waltham,
MA), anti-Cleaved Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology; Danvers, MA), and anti-ATF3
(Sigma-Aldrich; Darmstadt, Germany) were used. Anti-NeuN (MilliporeSigma; Darmstadt,
Germany) was used as a marker for neuronal cell bodies. Peripheral monocytes/macrophages
were labelled with anti-CD45 (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA).

Fluorescence Intensity Analysis
For fluorescence intensity, single plane 10x epifluorescence images were collected at the same
exposure time with a Zeiss Observer microscope equipped with Zen Blue acquisition software
(Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). Fluorescence intensity within each barrel was quantified similar
to what has been described previously22. Briefly, each image was analyzed in ImageJ (NIH)
where first all image pixel intensity thresholds were set to the full range of 16-bit images before
quantification to ensure a consistent pixel range across all images. To sample fluorescence
intensity, a circular region of interest (ROI) 75µm in circumference (4470.05 µm 2 area) was
placed within the center of 15-20 barrels per 10x field of view. A background ROI outside of the
barrel field was also taken for each image. The raw integrated density of pixels within each ROI
was measured and each barrel intensity value was background-corrected by subtraction of the

26
background ROI pixel intensity. Average intensity over all barrel ROIs was quantified for each
image and then normalized to the control hemisphere within each animal. All data analyses
were performed blind to genotype.

Engulfment Analysis
Engulfment analysis was performed according to previously described methods1,31. Briefly,
immunostained sections were imaged on a Zeiss Observer Spinning Disk Confocal microscope
equipped with diode lasers (405nm, 488nm, 594nm, 647nm) and Zen acquisition software
(Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). For each hemisphere, three to five 63x fields of view within the
barrel field were acquired with 50-70 z-stack steps at 0.27 µm spacing. Images were first
processed in ImageJ (NIH) and then individual images of 15-20 single cells per hemisphere per
animal were processed in Imaris (Bitplane; Zurich, Switzerland) as previously described. All
image files were blinded for unbiased quantification. All data was then normalized to the control,
spared hemisphere within each animal. Note, Cx3cr1+/- littermates were used for comparison to
Cx3cr1-/- mice as microglia within both sets of mice are labeled with EGFP and show similar
changes in TC synapses (Fig 2).

Synapse Density Analysis
Synapse density analysis was performed blind to condition and genotype as described
previously

1,3

. Briefly, immunostained sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM700 scanning

confocal microscope equipped with 405nm, 488nm, 555nm, and 639nm lasers and Zen
acquisition software (Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). Synapse density analysis was performed
on single plane confocal images in ImageJ (NIH). Three 63x fields of view per hemisphere per
animal were analyzed. Sample images for each genotype and condition were manually
thresholded by eye, and a consistent threshold range was determined (IsoData segmentation
method, 85-255). Each channel was thresholded and the Analyze Particles function with set

27
parameters for each marker (VGluT2 = 0.2-infinity; Homer1 = 0.1-infinity) was used to measure
the total pre- and postsynaptic puncta area. To quantify total synaptic area, Image Calculator
was used to visualize co-localized pre- and postsynaptic puncta and then the Analyze Particles
function was used to calculate the total area of co-localized puncta. Data for each hemisphere
was averaged across all three fields of view and then normalized to the control hemisphere
within each animal.

Bulk RNA sequencing
Mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation at indicated ages, and brain regions of interest were
dissected. Brain tissue from one mouse was immediately homogenized with a motor-driven
Teflon glass homogenizer in ice-cold polysome extraction buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150
mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma) 100 μg/mL cycloheximide (Sigma), EDTAfree protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 10 μL/mL RNasin (Promega) and Superasin (Applied
Biosystems). Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000g, 4 °C, to pellet large cell
debris. NP-40 (EMD Biosciences, CA) and 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti
Polar Lipids, AL) were added to the supernatant at final concentrations of 1% and 30 mM,
respectively. After incubation on ice for 5 min, the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at
13,000g to pellet insoluble material. RNA was purified from the lysate using RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was assayed using an RNA
Pico chip on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and only samples with RIN > 9
were considered for subsequent analysis. Double-stranded cDNA was generated from 1–5 ng of
RNA using Nugen Ovation V2 kit (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Fragments of 200 bp were obtained by sonicating 500 ng of cDNA per sample
using the Covaris-S2 system (duty cycle: 10%, intensity: 5.0, bursts per second: 200, duration:
120 s, mode: frequency sweeping, power: 23 W, temperature: 5.5–6 °C; Covaris Inc., Woburn,
MA). Subsequently, these fragments were used to produce libraries for sequencing by TruSeq

DNA Sample kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
quality of the libraries was assessed by 2200 TapeStation (Agilent). Multiplexed libraries were
directly loaded on NextSeq 500 (Illumina) with high-output single-read sequencing for 75 cycles.
Raw sequencing data was processed using Illumina bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software v2.17.
Raw sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) using the TopHat2 package
(v2.1.0). Reads were counted using HTSeq-count (v0.6.0) against the Ensembl v67 annotation.
The read alignment, read count, and quality assessment using metrics, such as total mapping
rate and mitochondrial and ribosomal mapping rates, were done in parallel using an in-house
workflow pipeline called SPEctRA. The raw counts were processed through a variance
stabilizing transformation (VST) procedure using the DESeq2 package to obtain transformed
values that are more suitable than the raw read counts for certain data mining tasks. Principal
component analysis (PCA) was performed on the top 500 most-variable genes across all
samples based on the VST data to visually assess whether there were any outliers. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering was used to assess the outliers once again to protect against false
positives/negatives from PCA, and the outliers were further justified by the aforementioned
quality control metrics as well as experimental metadata. After outlier removal, all pairwise
comparisons were performed on the count data of entire gene transcripts using the DESeq2
package (v1.6.3). A cutoff of adjusted P value < 0.05, and mean expression > 3.5. MA plot was
made using R (v3.1.1; https://www.R-project.org). For the heatmap, expression of each gene in
log2(RPKM) was normalized to the mean across all samples (z-scored). Heatmap with
hierarchical

(v.10.2; http://www.tm4.org/) with Pearson correlation by average link clustering. Bar graphs

made on GraphPad Prism v5.01 (https://www.graphpad.com).

Single-cell transcriptomics experimental design
Non-deprived, control and deprived barrel cortices from a total of 8 mice served as the
input for single-cell sequencing studies, equaling 16 samples total. The capture and barcoding
of single cells was performed across four separate experiments on two different days. Per
experiment, one littermate each of the genotypes Cx3cr1+/- and Cx3cr1-/- underwent unilateral
whisker cauterization at P4 and their deprived and non-deprived cortices were then processed
in parallel at P5, yielding 4 samples per experiment. 3,000 cells were collected from each
hemisphere of each mouse, equaling a total of ~48,000 cells collected overall. All libraries were
prepared in parallel then pooled and sequenced together across two sequencing runs, as
described below.
Generation of single-cell suspensions
Single-cell sequencing of mouse cortex using inDrops was performed as previously
described35,. Mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold choline solution containing 2.1 g
NaHCO3 per liter, 2.16 g glucose per liter, 0.172 g NaH2PO4∙H2O per liter, 7.5 mM MgCl2∙6H2O,
2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 15.36 g choline chloride per liter, 2.3 g ascorbic acid per liter, and
0.34 g pyruvic acid per liter (all chemicals, Sigma). A caveat of sequencing techniques that
involve mechanical and enzymatic dissociation is that the dissociation itself induces neural
activity-dependent and injury-induced gene transcription35. Therefore, because we were
interested in analyzing sensory experience-dependent changes in gene expression across all
cell types, a number of drugs that block neuronal activity and transcription were included in the
perfusion solution. These included 1 μM TTX (Sigma), 100 μM AP-V (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
5 μg actinomycin D (Sigma) per milliliter, and 10 μM triptolide (Sigma). Following the 5 minute
perfusion, deprived and non-deprived, control somatosensory cortices were microdissected and
each sample was transferred to a tube with 1.65 mL of pre-incubation solution containing HBSS
(Life Technologies), 10 mM HEPES, 172 mg kynurenic acid (Sigma) per liter, 0.86 g

MgCl2∙6H2O per liter, and 6.3 g D-glucose (Sigma) per liter, pH 7.35, which was saturated with
95% O2 and 5% CO2 previously but was not bubbled after the sample was added. The drugs
contained in the perfusion solution were also present in the pre-incubation solution at the same
concentrations. After 30 minutes on ice, 1.65 mL of papain (Worthington) was added to a final
concentration of 20 U per milliliter. Samples were moved to a rocker at 37° C and gently rocked
for 60 minutes.
Following the papain incubation at 37° C, a series of triturations in increasingly small
volumes were performed to fully dissociate the tissue. In between each round of trituration, the
tissue was filtered through the corner of a 40 μM nylon cell strainer (Corning). The cells were
then centrifuged at 300*g for 5 minutes and the pellet resuspended in 1 mL of trypsin inhibitor
(Worthington) plus DNAse (Sigma) in preincubation solution without drugs (dissociation media,
DM). The cells were washed by resuspension in DM adjusted to 0.04% BSA (Sigma) three
times, then resuspended in DM containing 0.04% BSA and 15% Optiprep (Sigma) to a
concentration of 100,000 cells per mL and transferred to the Single-Cell Core at Harvard
Medical School for inDrops collection (see Acknowledgements).
Single-cell RNA sequencing via inDrops
For each sample, approximately 3,000 cells were encapsulated into microfluidic droplets
containing polyacrylamide gels with embedded barcoded reverse transcription primers. Reverse
transcription was carried out in intact droplets to generate barcoded cDNA from a single cell.
Following droplet lysis, inDrops libraries were prepared as previously described34,

69

. All 16

libraries were indexed, pooled, and sequenced (Read 1: 54 cycles, Read 2: 21 cycles, Index 1:
8 cycles, Index 2: 8 cycles) across 2 runs on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) with an average read

depth across biological replicates of 8,815 reads per cell.

Sequenced reads were processed according to a previously published pipeline70. Briefly,
this pipeline was used to build a custom transcriptome from Ensembl GRCm38 genome and
GRCm38.84

annotation

using

Bowtie

1.1.1,

after

filtering

the

annotation

gtf

file

(gencode.v17.annotation.gtf filtered for feature_type=”gene”, gene_type="protein_coding" and
gene_status="KNOWN"). Read quality control and mapping against this transcriptome were
performed. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were used to link sequence reads back to
individual captured molecules. All steps of the pipeline were run using default parameters
unless explicitly stated.
Quality control and clustering of cells
All cells were combined into a single dataset. Nuclei with >10% mitochondrial content
were excluded from the dataset. Cells with fewer than 400 UMI counts were excluded. Cells
were then clustered using the Seurat R package71. The data were log normalized and scaled to
10,000 transcripts per cell. Variable genes were identified using the following parameters:
x.low.cutoff = 0.0125, x.high.cutoff = 3, y.cutoff = 0.5. We limited the analysis to the top 30
principal components. Clustering resolution was set to 0.6. The expression of known marker
genes was used to assign each cluster to one of the main cell types. Tubb3/Snap25 was used
to identify neurons, Gad1/Gad2 was used to identify inhibitory neurons, Rorb was used to
identify excitatory cortical layer IV neurons, Aldoc/Aqp4 was used to identify astrocytes,
Mbp/Plp1 was used to identify mature oligodendrocytes, Pdgfra/Matn4 was used to identify
immature oligodendrocytes, and P2ry12/C1qa was used to identify microglia. The analysis
reported here focused on the glial population and layer IV neurons, for which the following
numbers of cells per condition passed quality control filters and were included in subsequent
analyses. For cell numbers see Supplemental Figure 9g.
Identification of differentially-expressed genes

32
Differential gene expression analyses were performed in pairwise fashion between each of
the four groups using the R package Monocle272. The data were modeled using a negative
binomial distribution consistent with data generated by high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq
platforms such as inDrops. Unlike deep single-cell sequencing, inDrops probabilistically
captures/samples the transcriptome of each cell and retrieves only a small fraction of all the
present transcripts. Genes whose differential gene expression false discovery rate (FDR) was
less than 0.10 (FDR < 0.10) were considered statistically significant.
Cell Counts
For microglia cell counts, single plane 10x epifluorescence images were collected within
the barrel cortex at the same exposure time with a Zeiss Observer microscope equipped with
Zen Blue acquisition software (Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). Images of entire barrel fields from
10x images were quantified blind to genotype in ImageJ (NIH). Each individual barrel per field of
view was outlined and grouped as a single ROI. The same ROI was transposed to the
thresholded microglia channel where the number of microglia in the barrels was quantified by
counting the number of cells within the total barrel ROI. The entire perimeter of the barrel field
was then outlined and the number of microglia over the entire barrel field area was analyzed.
The number of microglia within the septa was quantified by subtracting the total number of
microglia within the barrels from the total number of microglia within the entire S1 ROI. The level
of microglia infiltration into the barrel field was quantified by calculating a ratio of the total
number of microglia in the barrels divided by the total number of microglia within the septa for
each time point. Note, Cx3cr1+/- littermates were used for comparison to Cx3cr1-/- mice as
microglia within both sets of mice are labeled with EGFP and show similar changes in TC
synapses (Fig 2). Similar results were obtained in wild-type mice labeling microglia with Iba-1
(data not shown).

33
For ATF3/Caspase-3/APP positive cell counts, single plane 20x (for trigeminal nerve
ganglia) and single plane 10x (for thalamic VPM and primary somatosensory cortex) were
taken. The number of NeuN positive and ATF3/Caspase 3/APP positive cells for each plane
were counted and divided by the total number of NeuN positive cells and normalized to the total
field of view area. For peripheral macrophage infiltration to the whisker follicles following
cauterization, single plane 20x images were taken. The number of CX3CR1-EGFP positive and
CD45 positive cells within a given whisker follicle were counted and normalized to the total area
of the whisker follicle.

In situ RNA hybridization
In situ RNA hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer’s specification with
slight modifications (ACDBio; Newark, CA). Briefly, mice were perfused with 4% PFA and brains
were post-fixed for 24 hours. 10μm cryo-sections were prepared and stored in -80°C. Prior to in
situ hybridization, cryo-sections were equilibrated to room temperature for 1 hour, then were
dehydrated in a serial dilution of ethanol. Sections were incubated in hydrogen peroxide for 10
minutes and rinsed with RNase free water. Sections were treated with “Protease Plus” for 15
minutes at room temperature and rinsed with phosphate buffered saline. In situ probes were
added and incubated for 2 hours at 40°C. Subsequent amplification steps were performed
according to the manufacturer’s specification. Slices were immunostained following in situ
hybridization. Sections were washed in 1X PBS for 10 minutes and blocked in 0.01% TritonX100 and 2% normal goat serum for 30 minutes. Primary antibody (NeuN; Millipore) prepared in
0.01% TritonX-100 and 2% normal goat serum and slides were incubated overnight at room
temperature. Secondary antibody was prepared in 0.01% TritonX-100 and 2% normal goat
serum and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. For Cx3cl1 in situ quantification,
fluorescent RNA signal was localized to DAPI and NeuN positive or DAPI and NeuN negative
cells with a MATLAB script (vR2016b). Individual channels were segmented with a set threshold

for dilating the masked signal around the NeuN positive or DAPI positive channels. For Adam10
in situ quantification, fluorescent RNA signal was co-localized to NeuN positive or Cx3cr1EGFP
positive cells and the number of puncta co-localized to either signal was measured with Image J
(NIH).

Structured Illumination Microscopy imaging
Immunostained sections were prepared as described above. Images were acquired on a GE
Healthcare DeltaVision OMX microscope for structured illumination microscopy. Images were
then processed in Imaris (Bitplane; Zurich,Switzerland) in order to 3D reconstruct the cell and
visualize engulfed material.

Slice Preparation and Electrophysiological Recordings
Male mice (~3 months old) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium
pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) and then were decapitated. The brain was quickly removed and
placed in an oxygenated ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM): 2.5 KCl, 1.25
NaH2PO4•H2O, 20 HEPES, 2 Thiourea, 5 Na-ascorbate, 92 NMDG, 30 NaHCO3, 25 DGlucose, 0.5 CaCl2•2H2O and 10 MgSO4•7H2O. Brain slices (200 μM) were made using a
Leica VT1200 vibratome (Leica Biosystems Inc.). The brain slices were immediately transferred
into an incubation chamber containing oxygenated cutting solution at 34°C for 20 minutes.
Slices were transferred into oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at room
temperature (24°C) for recording. ACSF solution contains (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2
NaH2PO4•H2O, 1.2 MgCl2•6H2O, 2.4 CaCl2•2H2O, 26 NaHCO3, 11 D-Glucose. Slices were
left in this chamber for at least 1 hour before being placed in a recording chamber at room
temperature. Single slices were transferred into a recording chamber continually superfused
with oxygenated ACSF (30 - 32°C) at a flow rate of ∼2 ml/min for recording. Cells were
visualized using infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) imaging on an Olympus BX-

50WI microscope. Electrophysiological recordings were recorded using an Axon Multiclamp
700B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices). Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current
(sEPSC) was acquired in the whole cell configuration and gap-free acquisition mode in Clampex
(Axon Instruments). Neurons were held at a membrane potential of -70 mV. Signals were
filtered at 1 kHz using the amplifier's four-pole, low-pass Bessel filter, digitized at 10 kHz with an
Axon Digidata 1440A interface and stored on a personal computer. Pipette solution contained
(in mM) 120 K gluconate; 5 KCl; 2 MgCl2•6H2O 10 HEPES; 4 ATP, 2 GTP. sEPSCs were
recorded in the presence of bicuculline (20 μM) in the bath solution to block GABAA
receptors.After recordings stabilized, 1 min duration of recording was taken for sEPSC analysis.
sEPSC frequency and amplitude was detected using Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft Inc.
Fort Lee, NJ). All recordings and quantification were performed blind.

Pharmacological Inhibition of ADAM10
C57Bl/6J (fluorescence intensity analysis) or Cx3cr1EGFP/+ (microglia engulfment analysis) mice
were daily injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg GI254023X (Millipore-Sigma, Darmstadt,
Germany). The drug was prepared daily in 0.1M carbonate buffer/10% DMSO vehicle. Control
littermate animals were vehicle injected following the same drug schedule for both fluorescence
intensity and microglia engulfment analyses.

Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism 7 (La Jolla, CA) provided the platform for all statistical and graphical analyses.
All data sets were first tested and found to be normally distributed and parametric stats were
subsequently run. Analyses included Students t-test when comparing 2 conditions or two-way
ANOVA followed by Sidak’s or Tukey’s post hoc analyses (indicated in figure legends). For
population data (percentage of cells expressing or binned data) a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test
