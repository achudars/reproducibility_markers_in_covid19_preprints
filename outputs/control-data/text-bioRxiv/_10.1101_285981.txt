Abstract:

61

Background: Although habituation is one of the most ancient and fundamental forms of learning, its

62

regulators and relevance for human disease are poorly understood.

63

Methods: We manipulated the orthologs of 286 genes implicated in intellectual disability (ID) with or

64

without comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) specifically in Drosophila neurons, and tested

65

these models in light‐off jump habituation. We dissected neuronal substrates underlying the

66

identified habituation deficits and integrated genotype‐phenotype annotations, gene ontologies and

67

interaction networks to determine the clinical features and molecular processes that are associated

68

with habituation deficits.

69

Results: We identified more than 100 genes required for habituation learning. For the vast majority

70

of these, 93 genes, a role in habituation learning was previously unknown. These genes characterize

71

ID disorders with macrocephaly/overgrowth and comorbid ASD. Moreover, ASD individuals from the

72

Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) carrying damaging de novo mutations in these genes exhibit

73

increased aberrant behaviors associated with inappropriate, stereotypic speech. At the molecular

74

level, ID genes required for normal habituation are enriched in synaptic function and converge on

75

Ras‐MAPK signaling. Both increased Ras‐MAPK signaling in GABAergic and decreased Ras‐MAPK

76

signaling in cholinergic neurons specifically inhibit the adaptive habituation response.

77

Conclusions: Our work supports the relevance of habituation learning to autism, identifies an

78

unprecedented number of novel habituation players, supports an emerging role for inhibitory

79

neurons in habituation and reveals an opposing, circuit‐level‐based mechanism for Ras‐MAPK

80

signaling. This establishes habituation as a possible, widely applicable functional readout and target

81

for pharmacologic intervention in ID/ASD.

83

Introduction:

84

Habituation is one of the most ancient and fundamental forms of learning, conserved across the

85

animal kingdom (1). It causes an organism’s initial response to repeated meaningless stimuli to

86

gradually decline. Learning to ignore irrelevant stimuli as a result of habituation is thought to

87

represent a filter mechanism that prevents information overload, allowing for selective attention,

88

thereby focusing cognitive resources on relevant matters. Habituation learning has been proposed to

89

represent an important prerequisite for higher cognitive functions (2–4). In line with this, habituation

90

in infants correlates better than other measures with later cognitive abilities (5). However, key

91

players and molecular mechanisms underlying habituation are poorly understood (6).

92

In humans, deficits in habituation have been reported in a number of neuropsychiatric and

93

behavioral disorders. In particular, defective cortical filtering of sensory stimuli and information

94

overload, as expected to arise from habituation deficits, are thought to represent mechanisms

95

contributing to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (7, 8). A decreased ability to habituate has been

96

described in a fraction of ASD individuals (9–11), but has not been connected yet to specific genetic

97

defects, with a single exception. Recently, two independent studies demonstrated habituation

98

deficits in patients with Fragile X syndrome, the most common monogenic cause of intellectual

99

disability (ID) and ASD (12, 13), confirming previously reported habituation deficits in Fmr1 KO mice

100

(14, 15). Habituation deficits have also been reported in a limited number of other ID or ASD

101

(ID/ASD) disease models (16–19).

102

Because assessing human gene function in habituation is challenging, we utilized a cross‐

103

species approach. We apply light‐off jump habituation in Drosophila to increase our knowledge on

104

the genetic control of habituation and, at the same time, to address the relevance of decreased

105

habituation in ID and in comorbid ASD disorders. Since ID is present in 70% of individuals with ASD

106

(20), monogenic causes of ID provide a unique molecular windows to ASD pathology (21). Drosophila

107

is a powerful, well‐established model for ID (22–24) and offers genome‐wide resources to study gene

108

function in large scale (25, 26). Several forms of habituation have been established in Drosophila (27–
5

109

31). Deficits in light‐off jump habituation have already been reported in several ID models (23, 32–

110

36) and in classical learning and memory mutants (28, 31). Moreover, this form of habituation can be

111

assessed in a high‐throughput manner. In the light‐off jump paradigm, the initial jump response to

112

repeated light‐off stimuli gradually wanes, as has been demonstrated not due to sensory adaptation

113

(a decrease in detecting the stimulus) or motor fatigue (a decrease in the ability to execute the

114

response) but as a result of learned adaptation of the startle circuit (31). This behavior meets all

115

habituation criteria (37), including spontaneous recovery and dishabituation with a novel stimulus

116

(31, 38).

117

Here, we use inducible RNA interference (RNAi) in Drosophila to systematically assess the

118

role of Drosophila orthologs of 286 genes that are well‐established to cause ID in humans when

119

mutated (hereinafter referred to as ID genes). 68 of them (20%) have also been implicated in ASD

120

(39, 40) (Table S1), hereinafter referred to as ID plus ASD‐associated genes.

Methods and Materials

123

Investigated ID genes

124

A systematic source of ID genes and their Drosophila orthologs is available online (SysID database,

125

sysid.cmbi.umcn.nl (41)). We investigated the Drosophila orthologs of 286 human ID genes from the

126

SysID category primary ID genes (Table S1) (containing mutations with robust published evidence for

127

causality, see Supplemental Methods (SM)). SysID inclusion criteria and in/exclusion criteria of

128

experimentally investigated genes are indicated in the SM). In brief, the vast majority of genes are

129

from the first data freeze of the SysID database (status of mid 2010). Genes have been included

130

based on conservation in Drosophila, available tools (RNAi) from large‐scale resources and viability as

131

a prerequisite for behavioral testing. No selection was performed.

3‐ to 7‐day‐old flies were subjected to the light‐off jump habituation paradigm in two independent

135

16‐unit light‐off jump systems (manufactured and distributed by Aktogen Ltd.). After 5 min adaption,

136

flies were simultaneously exposed to a series of 100 light‐off pulses (15 ms) with 1 s interval. The

137

noise amplitude of wing vibration during jump responses was recorded. An appropriate threshold

138

(0.8 V) was applied to filter out background noise. Data were collected by a custom‐made Labview

139

Software (National Instruments). Flies were considered as habituated when not jumping in five

140

consecutive light‐off trials (no‐jump criterion). Habituation was quantified as the number of trials

141

required to reach the no‐jump criterion (Trials To Criterion (TTC)).

Results:

151
152

Systematic identification of habituation deficits in Drosophila models of ID

153

To identify novel genes implicated in habituation, we systematically investigated the role of 278

154

Drosophila orthologs representing 286 human ID genes in the light‐off jump habituation paradigm.

155

We induced neuron‐specific knockdowns of each ID gene ortholog by RNAi (25) using 513 RNAi lines

156

fulfilling previously established quality criteria (41, 42), with two independent constructs per gene

157

whenever available. These were crossed to the panneuronal elav‐Gal4 driver line (see SM).

158

Knockdown is a suitable approach for modeling of the here‐investigated human disease conditions

159

since (partial) loss of function is considered to be the underlying mechanism in the vast majority of

160

these disorders (42) (Table S1). Restricting gene knockdown to neurons eliminates potential effects

161

on viability or behavioral performance originating from an essential role of genes in other tissues and

162

establishes neuron‐autonomous mechanisms.

163

Knockdown and control flies of identical genetic background were subjected to a series of

164

100 light‐off stimuli, hereinafter referred to as trials, in the light‐off jump habituation paradigm. The

165

screening procedure and paradigm allowed us to distinguish the following parameters: viability,

166

initial jump response (percentage of flies that jumped in at least one of the first five trials), and

167

premature and reduced habituation, with the latter representing the learning‐defective phenotype

168

category of main interest. Genotypes with an initial jump response ≥50% but premature habituation

169

were subjected to a secondary assay to exclude fatigue as a confounder of premature habituation

170

(see SM, Table S2 and Figure S4). Based on these parameters, genes were assigned to at least one of

171

four phenotype categories (Figure 1A): (1) “not affected”: (both) tested RNAi lines targeting such

172

genes were viable, showed good initial jump response, and had no significant effect on habituation

173

(based on the FDR‐corrected p‐value (padj), see SM); (2) “non‐performers”: at least one RNAi line led

174

to lethality, poor jump response (<50% initial jumpers), or premature habituation because of

175

increased fatigue; (3) “habituation deficient”: at least one RNAi line showed good initial jump

176

response but failed to suppress the response with the increasing number of light‐off trials (based on

177

padj); and (4) “premature habituation”: at least one RNAi line showed good initial jump response

178

followed by faster decline (based on padj), without fatigue being detectable in the secondary assay.

179

Still, this latter phenotype category can result from other defects than improved habituation, and will

180

be investigated elsewhere. In this study we focus on habituation deficits (3), corresponding to the

181

phenotype that has been shown in ID and ASD (9–13).

182

We validated the experimental approach to identify genes which, if manipulated, cause

183

habituation deficits (hereinafter referred to as habituation deficient genes) by recapitulating

184

published habituation deficits of Drosophila ID null mutant models G9a (23) and Synapsin (43), and of

185

the classical learning and memory mutant dunce (28, 44, 45) (Figure 1B,C,D). This demonstrated that

186

light‐off jump habituation upon RNAi can efficiently identify genetic regulators of habituation

187

learning. We also validated the technical accuracy of the automated jump scoring methodology by

188

comparing automated and manually assessed jumping of controls and a number of ID models (SM,

189

Figure S1).

190

In our screen, we found that the Drosophila orthologs of 98 human ID genes (35% of all

191

investigated orthologs) are required, in neurons, for habituation learning. This phenotype represents

192

a highly specific defect in behavioral adaptation to the stimulus; flies keep on jumping in response to

193

the repetitive light‐off stimulus, illustrating that they do not suffer from broad neuronal transmission

194

deficits (which would disable jumping), fatigue, sensory or other deficiencies. No excessive

195

locomotion was observed when handling the flies, and no stimulus hypersensitivity or random

196

jumping was found (see SM and Figure S2, S3 for validation of light‐off jump habituation assay

197

specificity). 27% of ID gene orthologs had no effect on habituation, 41% fell into the category of

198

“non‐performers”, and 8% showed “premature habituation” without detectable fatigue. The

199

complete list of habituation screen results and distribution of human ID genes in phenotype

200

categories can be found in Table S2, S3. The screen thus identified nearly a hundred orthologs of

201

disease genes controlling habituation learning.

202
203

Habituation deficits characterize ID genes with synaptic function

204

We first asked whether genes characterized by habituation deficits in Drosophila converge on specific

205

biological process. ID genes are known to be enriched in a number of biological processes, but which

206

are important for habituation? Performing an enrichment analysis of ID‐enriched Gene Ontology‐

207

based (GO) categories (see SM) against the background of the investigated ID genes, we found that

208

“habituation deficient” genes are significantly enriched in a sole GO‐based category: processes

209

related to the synapse (22/44 ID genes, E=1.59, p=0.024, Figure 2, Table S4). No enriched GO terms

210

were found in the “not affected” category. Together, our results support synaptic processes to be

211

crucial for habituation, as previously shown for other forms of this behavior (46, 47).

212
213

Drosophila habituation deficits characterize ID genes associated with macrocephaly

214

To understand whether habituation deficits in Drosophila represent a proxy of specific phenotypes in

215

human individuals, we performed enrichment analysis among ID‐associated clinical features (41). We

216

found that orthologs of ID genes characterized by habituation deficits in Drosophila are specifically

217

enriched among ID genes associated with macrocephaly/overgrowth (Figure 3, E=2.19, p=0.018,

218

Table S4). In contrast, ID genes characterized as “non‐performers” show enrichment in different,

219

severe ID‐associated features such as endocrine, limb and eye anomalies, brain malformations and

220

obesity (Figure S5, Table S4). Moreover, ID genes not giving rise to habituation deficits (“not

221

affected” category) did not show any enrichment among ID‐associated clinical features (Figure 3,

222

Table S4).

223
224

Habituation deficits characterize ID genes associated with ASD and deficits in specific ASD‐relevant

225

behavioral domains

226

There is a long‐known relationship between macrocephaly and autism (48). For this reason and

227

because of the potential relevance of habituation deficits to ASD (9–11), we decided to further

10

228

investigate the relationship of Drosophila habituation and human ASD. We used the Simons Simplex

229

Collection (SSC) (40), a genetically and phenotypically well‐characterized cohort of sporadic ASD

230

individuals. We matched genes with likely gene‐disrupting (LGD) and likely damaging de novo

231

mutations (49, 50) in this ASD cohort to those included in our experimental Drosophila habituation

232

approach. 47 ASD individuals carried mutations in 33 of the investigated genes (Table S5). We first

233

asked whether these ID plus ASD‐associated genes preferentially fall into a specific Drosophila

234

phenotype category. They are significantly enriched among the genes that in Drosophila caused

235

habituation deficits (Figure 4A, E=1.64, p=0.029, Table S4, ASD SSC). Independently, significant

236

enrichment was obtained for high‐confidence ID plus ASD‐associated genes identified from the SFARI

237

database (39) (38 investigated genes, Figure 4B, E=1.65, p=0.016, Table S4, ASD SFARI), suggesting a

238

relationship between Drosophila habituation deficits and human ASD.

239

To further characterize the relationship between Drosophila habituation and human

240

phenotypes, we divided the SSC individuals into two distinct clusters based on their habituation

241

phenotype in the corresponding fly models: habituation deficits (N=22 individuals, 17 genes) and no

242

habituation deficits (N=12 individuals, 9 genes) (Table S5; another N=13 individuals, 7 genes fall into

243

the non‐informative phenotype groups “non‐performers”/“premature habituation”). We compared

244

both groups across five broad quantitative measures of behavior and cognition: cognitive ability (full‐

245

scale IQ); Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS); depression and anxiety (Child Behavior Checklist

246

Internalizing Disorders, CBCL‐Int); impulsivity, attention and conduct (Child Behavior Checklist

247

Externalizing Disorders, CBCL‐Ext); and atypical behavior (Aberrant Behavior Checklist, ABC). There

248

was no significant difference for IQ (p=0.61), SRS (p=0.62), CBCL‐Int (p=0.59) or CBCL‐Ext (p=0.37),

249

but a trend for ABC (p=0.04; Figure 4C, Table S6). This effect is mainly driven by the ABC subdomain

250

of inappropriate, stereotypic speech (p=0.0003), not from the subdomains of irritability (p=0.1),

251

hyperactivity (p=0.86), lethargy (p=0.54) or stereotypy (p=0.91) (Table S6). In summary, these data

252

indicate that habituation deficits in Drosophila are relevant to ASD‐implicated genes. They also

253

suggest that SSC individuals carrying de novo mutations in genes associated with habituation deficits

11

254

in Drosophila show a higher rate and/or severity of atypical behaviors associated with inappropriate

255

and stereotypic speech.

256
257

Molecular networks and modules underlying habituation

258

With the rich repertoire of nearly a hundred genes required for habituation that moreover show

259

specificity for ASD and synapse function, we set out to determine the molecular pathways these

260

genes are operating in. ID gene products are significantly interconnected via protein‐protein

261

interactions (51, 52). Consistent with previously published findings (41), ID genes investigated in our

262

screen are 1.69 times enriched in interactions compared to 1000 randomly chosen protein sets of the

263

same size and number of known interactions (physical interaction enrichment (PIE) score (53) =1.69;

264

p<0.001). To identify biologically relevant modules, we resolved this network into communities with

265

even tighter interconnectivity using unsupervised community clustering (54). This analysis resulted in

266

26 communities containing 109 proteins (Figure 5A, Table S7). Their proximity and specificity for ID‐

267

enriched GO‐based processes are depicted in Figure S6. Mapping “habituation deficient” genes onto

268

the communities (Figure 5A, red circles) highlighted modules with high incidence of habituation

269

deficits (Figure 5A).

270
271

A key role for ID and ASD‐associated Ras signaling in habituation

272

Five communities form a large, interconnected module with high incidences of habituation deficits.

273

However, the tightly interconnected hub at its center is characterized by the absence of habituation

274

deficits (Figure 5A, square). This hub represents the key proteins of Ras‐MAPK signaling (Figure 5B).

275

This pathway, best known for its role in cancer, underlies a group of disorders collectively referred as

276

Rasopathies. Importantly, while 92% of the modeled ID disorders are thought to result from loss of

277

function of the underlying genes, Rasopathies are caused by gain‐of‐function mutations in the core

278

pathway (Figure 5C, Table S1). The utilized RNAi approach, despite addressing gene function, did

279

thus not recapitulate the molecular pathology of these specific cognitive disorders. However,

12

280

Rasopathies can also result from loss of function in negative regulators of the pathway. We therefore

281

asked whether the same genetic mechanisms that cause Rasopathies in humans also hold true for

282

habituation deficits in Drosophila. In our screen, we tested habituation of two negative regulators of

283

Ras: NF1 (Drosophila Nf1) (55) and SPRED1 (Drosophila Spred) (56, 57). Panneuronal knockdown of

284

either regulator caused strong habituation deficits (Figure 5D, in red). We therefore tested a

285

constitutively active Ras mutant, Ras1R68Q (58). Heterozygous Ras1R68Q flies showed strong

286

habituation deficits compared to the control flies with the same genetic background (p=3.56x10‐9;

287

Figure 5D, in green). The same was true when we overexpressed, specifically in neurons, Ras1R68Q

288

allele from an inducible transgene (p=1.96x10‐6; Figure 5D, in green). We conclude that increased

289

activity of Ras, causing Rasopathies and associated cognitive deficits in humans, causes habituation

290

deficits in Drosophila.

We next aimed to identify in which type of neurons the habituation‐inhibiting function of Ras‐MAPK

295

signaling resides. Because the well‐characterized neurons of the giant fiber circuit controlling the

296

light‐off jump response are cholinergic (59), just as the majority of excitatory neurons in Drosophila,

297

we first tested whether increased Ras‐MAPK signaling activity would induce habituation deficits

298

when directed to cholinergic neurons. For this, we adopted the knockdown of negative Ras

299

regulators (Nf1, Spred), expressed constitutively active Ras1 (Ras1R68Q), and tested expression of a

300

gain‐of‐function allele of Raf (RafGOF), a downstream mediator of Ras signaling. None of these, when

301

driven by the cholinergic Cha‐Gal4 driver, recapitulated the panneuronally evoked habituation

302

deficits (Figure 6A).

303

Because of the recently established role of GABAergic neurons in Drosophila olfactory and

304

proboscis extension reflex habituation (29, 60, 61) and the emerging importance of GABA inhibition

305

in autism (62), we next targeted GABA neurons using the Gad1‐Gal4 driver and the same toolbox.

306

This consistently induced habituation deficits in all tested conditions (Figure 6B). We conclude that

307

the habituation‐inhibiting function of increased Ras‐MAPK signaling maps to GABAergic neurons.

308
309

Ras‐MAPK signaling in cholinergic neurons is essential for habituation learning

310

Impaired jump response/increased fatigue associated with Ras, Raf and Mek knockdown in the

311

screen could potentially mask an essential role for Ras signaling in habituation, in addition to the

312

habituation‐inhibiting function of increased Ras‐MAPK signaling. In fact, our screen also identified

313

habituation deficits upon RNAi of the positive Ras‐MAPK regulators Sos and Csw. We therefore

314

downregulated Ras‐MAPK activity by crossing the UAS‐based RNAi lines targeting Sos and Csw, but

315

also RNAi lines targeting Ras, Raf and Mek, to the GABAergic driver Gad1‐Gal4. We did not observe

316

any detrimental effect on habituation (Figure 6D). In contrast, downregulating Ras‐MAPK signaling in

317

cholinergic neurons consistently prevented normal habituation learning (Figure 6C). We conclude

318

that Ras‐MAPK signaling is essential in cholinergic but not in GABAergic neurons. Thus, Ras‐MAPK

319

signaling plays a dual, opposing role in inhibitory versus excitatory neurons in habituation learning.

Discussion:

322

Drosophila screen demonstrates that genes implicated in ASD are important for habituation

323

learning

324

To

325

neurodevelopmental disorders, we investigated 286 ID genes with a clear Drosophila ortholog in

326

light‐off jump habituation. Panneuronal knockdown of the orthologs of 98 ID genes specifically

327

suppressed the adaptive habituation response to repeated stimulation without affecting organismal

328

health or jump ability. Follow‐up work on the Ras‐MAPK pathway raised this number to 104. 93 of

329

these are novel regulators of habituation, substantially exceeding the sum of previously known

330

regulators of habituation across species and paradigms. Stringent criteria for RNAi specificity and

331

correction for multiple testing (see SM) in our experiments ensured a minimal level of potential false

332

positive discoveries. Of thirteen previously identified ID genes with habituation deficits, our screen

333

confirmed ten (Table S8). Our approach and data, although based on experiments in another species,

334

suggest that deficits in habituation learning are a widely affected mechanism in ID. Habituation

335

deficits might be a hallmark of even more ID genes than determined here. In particular, the

336

phenotype category of “non‐performers” is likely to contain genes with promiscuous functions

337

masking a specific role in habituation learning.

338

Enrichment analysis of ID‐associated clinical features revealed that “habituation deficient” ID

339

genes are preferentially characterized by macrocephaly/overgrowth, associated for long with ASD

340

(48). Strikingly, we found that mutations in genes associated with Drosophila habituation deficits are

341

significantly overrepresented among ID genes that are also implicated in ASD (52% (SSC cohort); 53%

342

(SFARI database)). In comparison the frequency of habituation deficits among ID genes not

343

associated with ASD is 24%. SSC individuals carrying mutations in these genes show a high rate

344

and/or severity of aberrant behaviors associated with stereotypic speech. Habituation deficits thus

345

represent a common phenotypic signature of ASD in Drosophila and highlight specific behavioral

346

subdomains affected in ASD. Future work has to establish whether habituation deficits are a direct

347

basis for these clinical features, or are one of many factors involved.

348
349

Synapse‐related processes and Ras‐MAPK signaling play a key role in habituation

350

Synapse biology has been proposed to play a central role in ASD (63). Our data show that among the

351

investigated disease genes, “habituation deficient” genes are specifically enriched in genes with

352

synaptic function. This is in line with habituation representing a measurable form of synaptic

353

plasticity (7, 47, 64).

354

Analyzing the distribution of “habituation deficient” genes in ID‐specific molecular

355

interaction networks, we discovered that they accumulate in a multiple‐community module and

356

connect to the Ras‐MAPK pathway core proteins Ras, Raf and Mek (Figure 5A,B). We observed

357

habituation deficits upon panneuronal knockdown of Ras negative regulators and panneuronal

358

expression of the constitutively active Ras allele Ras1R68Q (Figure 5C), demonstrating that increased

359

Ras‐mediated signaling causes habituation deficits. Moreover, proteins encoded by “habituation

360

deficient” genes form a significantly interconnected module (Figure 7). The coherence of this module

361

further supports the validity of the chosen RNAi approach to identify genes and molecular processes

362

regulating habituation learning. The module contains a number of synaptic proteins (Figure 7) with

363

not yet investigated roles in Ras signaling. It would be interesting to determine whether some of

364

these enlarge the spectrum of diseases caused by deregulated Ras signaling.

365
366

Ras‐MAPK signaling exerts a dual but opposing role in inhibitory versus excitatory neurons, a novel

367

systems‐level mechanism

368

Identification of neuronal substrates in which specific ID genes are required to warrant habituation

369

learning is important fundamental problem. Restoring the function of affected neurons might also

370

represent a suitable treatment strategy. The light‐off jump startle circuit of Drosophila is relatively

371

simple and its cholinergic nature is well described (59). However, it is not known how habituation of

16

372

this circuit is regulated. The commonly accepted view regards synaptic depression in excitatory

373

neurons, induced by repetitive stimulation, as the underlying mechanism (46, 65). This has recently

374

been challenged by Ramaswami and colleagues who showed that plasticity of inhibitory, GABAergic

375

neurons drives two non‐startle types of habituation (60, 61). We found that increased activity of our

376

identified key pathway, Ras‐MAPK, in GABAergic but not in cholinergic neurons causes deficits in

377

light‐off jump habituation. Our results thus support inhibitory circuits as crucial components of

378

habituation learning across different paradigms and sensory modalities. Further experiments are

379

needed to establish the direct involvement of GABAergic signaling. At the same time, we identified

380

that also decreased Ras‐MAPK signaling activity can lead to habituation deficits. Yet, the neuronal

381

substrates of these deficits are different and map to excitatory, cholinergic neurons. Although our

382

experiments do not distinguish between developmental effects and acute circuit plasticity, the

383

opposing role for Ras‐MAPK signaling on habituation may provide new insights into mechanisms of

384

neural plasticity in health and disease. It may also have crucial implications for treatment of

385

Rasopathies. Future clinical trials, as opposed to those that broadly decreased Ras activity and failed

386

(66), may need more attention towards restoring circuit function and balance.

387
388

Translational value and application of cross‐species habituation measures for diagnosis and

389

treatment of ID and ASD

390

Based on our findings that habituation is widely affected in Drosophila models of ID, and that

391

habituation deficits are particularly common among genes also implicated in ASD, we propose that

392

disrupted habituation may be one of the mechanisms that contribute to ID/ASD pathology.

393

The emerging importance of inhibitory inputs for habituation ((29, 60) and this study) and

394

sensory information filtering in the cortical centers of the brain (67, 68) suggests the existence of an

395

overarching circuit‐based mechanism responsible for prevention of inappropriate behavioral

396

responses (7). Though our findings that habituation deficits in Drosophila correlate with increased

397

rate and/or severity of atypical ASD‐related behaviors compared to ID genes without habituation

398

deficits should be replicated, we speculate that disrupted habituation arising from GABAergic defects

399

may contribute to these ASD features. If future work can establish a substantial contribution of

400

deficits in habituation learning to patient outcomes, cross‐species habituation could become an

401

attractive mechanism‐specific functional readout—a pressing need for efficient personalized

402

(pharmacological) treatment in the field of neurodevelopmental disorders. Implementing suitable

403

low‐burden protocols for habituation measures in clinical research and diagnostics of ID/ASD, such as

404

those developed for investigation of habituation deficits in Fragile X syndrome (12, 13), will help to

405

further delineate the affected cognitive domains that may correlate with or arise from deficient

406

habituation. In future clinical trials, these could serve as objective and quantitative readouts for

407

patient stratification in mechanism‐based treatment strategies and for monitoring of drug efficacy.

408

Dissection of the underlying defective mechanisms in Drosophila can at the same time identify novel

409

targets for treatment, with high‐throughput light‐off jump habituation serving as a translational

410

pipeline for drug testing.

(A) Procedure, phenotype categories and phenotype distribution of the light‐off jump habituation

screen. Knockdowns that resulted in lethality, no jumper phenotype (defined as less than 50% flies

592

jumping in at least one of the first five light‐off trials) or premature habituation plus increased fatigue

593

were assigned to the category “non‐performers” and their habituation was not further analyzed.

594

Other phenotype categories are “habituation deficient”, “not affected”, and “premature habituation”

595

(the latter if no fatigue was detected in secondary assay, see example in Figure S4). Drosophila

596

orthologs of 34% of the investigated human ID genes were associated with defects in habituation
