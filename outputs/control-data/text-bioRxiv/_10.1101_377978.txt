Introduction
Over the past 75 years, a number of statisticians have
advised that the data-analysis method known as
null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) should be
deprecated ​(Berkson, 1942; Halsey et al., 2015;
Wasserstein et al., 2019)​. The limitations of NHST have
been extensively discussed, with a broad consensus that
current statistical practice in the biological sciences
needs reform. However, there is less agreement on
reform’s specific nature, with vigorous debate
surrounding what would constitute a suitable alternative
(Altman et al., 2000; Benjamin et al., 2017; Cumming and
Calin-Jageman, 2016)​. An emerging view is that a more
complete analytic technique would use statistical
graphics to estimate effect sizes and evaluate their
uncertainty ​(Cohen, 1994; Cumming and Calin-Jageman,
2016)​. As these estimation methods require only minimal
statistical retraining, they have great potential to shift
the current data-analysis culture away from dichotomous
thinking towards quantitative reasoning ​(Claridge-Chang
and Assam, 2016)​.​ The evolution of statistics has been
inextricably linked to the development of quantitative
displays that support complex visual reasoning ​(Tufte,
2001)​. We consider that the graphic we describe here as
estimation plot ​is the most intuitive way to display the
complete statistical information about experimental data

sets. However, a major obstacle to adopting estimation
plots is accessibility to suitable software. To lower this
hurdle, we have developed free software that makes
high-quality estimation plotting available to all. Here, we
explain the rationale for estimation plots by contrasting
them with conventional charts used to display data with
NHST results, and describe how the use of these graphs
affords five major analytical advantages.
The two-groups design is fundamental
While NHST limits the analyst to the ill-conceived
question of ‘Does it?’ ​(McCloskey, 2002)​, estimation
instead draws the analyst’s attention to the question of
‘How much?’ — the very topic that defines quantitative
research. A fundamental research tool is an experiment
that uses control and intervention samples: the
two-groups ​design. Two-groups data are traditionally
analyzed by Student’s ​t​-test and its variants. We will use
a series of visualizations of two-groups data to illustrate
the progression from NHST to estimation-oriented
analysis.

Figure 1. The evolution of two-groups data graphics
A.​ Two-groups data presented in a bar chart. Control (C) and test groups (T) are shown as blue and
orange bars, respectively.
B. ​The same data presented as a box plot.
C. ​A scatter plot (with jitter) allows for all observed values to be visualized (alongside
appropriately-offset crossbars to indicate the mean and standard deviation for each group), but
does not illustrate the groups’ comparison (ie. the effect size).
D.​ A visualization of the two-groups comparison from the null-hypothesis significance testing
perspective. The filled curve on the difference axis indicates the null-hypothesis distribution of
the mean difference. By definition, this distribution has a mean difference of zero. The area of the
red segment indicates the ​P ​value (for one-sided testing).
E. ​An estimation plot uses the difference axis to display on an effect size, here the mean
difference (∆). The filled curve indicates the resampled ∆ distribution, given the observed data.

Horizontally aligned with the mean of the test group, the ∆ is indicated by the red circle. The 95%
confidence interval of ∆ is illustrated by the red vertical line.

Significance tests obscure two data aspects
The Student’s ​t​-test makes the assumption that two
groups have identical means (i.e. it proposes that the
effect size is zero). It then challenges this null hypothesis
with the observed data, by calculating the chance of
seeing the observed effect size (or greater) within the
hypothesized null distribution—this is the ​P​ value. If the
probability falls below a certain threshold (typically ​P ​<
0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected. The analyst then
plots the two groups’ means in a bar chart and denotes
‘significance’ by marking it with a star (​Figure 1A​). This
visualization has two important deficiencies. First, by
displaying only the means and width of their errors, a bar
chart obscures the observed values ​(2014)​. Second, NHST
plots show only the test result (as indicated by a star or a
P​ value), while omitting a diagram of the null distribution
itself. The omission of the full dataset and distributional
information in ​t​-tests is a reflection of how NHST—by
focusing on an accept/reject dichotomy—diverts
attention from effect quantification.
The transparency of bar charts is only modestly improved
with box plots (​Figure 1B​); although they do outline more
distributional information, box plots do not display
complex attributes (e.g. bimodality) or the individual
values ​(Matejka and Fitzmaurice, 2017)​.
Data-transparency is facilitated with the use of dot plots
that show every datum ​(Cleveland and McGill, 1984; 2017)
(​Figure 1C​). Dot plots are best drawn as beeswarm plots,
which convey histogram-like information about the
distribution while still displaying every observation
(Ecklund, 2015; Waskom et al., 2016; Wilkinson, 1999)
(​Figure 1D​).

Even when fully visualized, significance tests are
misleading
An NHST plot can be made more informative by including
a second axis to the side of the observed values ​(Gardner
and Altman, 1986)​. This ​difference axis​ appropriately
draws the viewer’s attention to the magnitude and
variability information in the two groups’ comparison
(Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016)​. We can use this axis
to diagram NHST (​Figure 1D​). This design has three main
features. (1) The mean of the null is the difference-axis
origin, zero. (2) The origin is flanked by a ​sampling-error
distribution​; this null distribution can constructed with
permutation ​(Pitman, 1937)​. (3) The ​P​ value is visualized
as the tail segment of the distribution that is more
extreme than the observed effect size. If this tail segment
is smaller than a predefined significance level,
traditionally α = 0.05, an analyst will reject the null.
While visualizing the null distribution is an improvement,
this picture nevertheless illustrates the flawed logic of
NHST: in order to prove that the null hypothesis is false,
the analyst must invoke the existence of something (the
tail segment) that the hypothesis predicts ​(Berkson,
1942)​. NHST has been criticized for this fallacy, as well as
its misleading dichotomization ​(McShane and Gal, 2017;
Yildizoglu et al., 2015)​. Even the premise of NHST is
incorrect: any intervention to any system will produce
some (at least infinitesimal) effect, thus a hypothesis of a
precisely zero effect size is inevitably false ​(Cohen, 1994)​.
Estimation plots combine transparency and insight
As interventions always have effects, the analyst’s
appropriate task is to quantify the effect size and assess
its precision. First introduced by two biostatisticians over
30 years ago ​(Gardner and Altman, 1986)​, the best design
for the analysis of two groups is an estimation plot that

visualizes observed values and the effect size
side-by-side. In this graphic, the difference-axis origin is
aligned with the mean of the test group, making it easy to
relate observed values to the ​difference of means, ​∆
(​Figure 1E​). Around ∆, the analyst plots an indicator of
precision known as the 95% ​confidence interval ​(CI)
(Altman et al., 2000)​. The current design updates the
Gardner-Altman plot by diagramming the sampling-error
distribution as a filled curve.
Five key advantages of estimation plots
Estimation plots possess five key advantages over
conventional NHST plots. First, as mentioned above, the
difference axis affords transparency of the comparison
being made. Second, while ​P ​values conflate magnitude
and precision in a single number, the relative size of a CI
provides a specific measure of its precision. Third,
plotting the full sampling-error curve of the effect size
prevents dichotomous thinking and draws attention to
the distribution’s graded nature. Fourth, deriving this
sampling-error curve with bootstrapping makes the
method robust and versatile. Fifth, and most importantly,
by focusing attention on an effect size, the difference
diagram encourages quantitative reasoning about the
system under study. Such reasoning empowers scientists
to make domain-specific judgements on whether an
effect magnitude is noteworthy and relevant to their
research question.
Estimation plots are accessible
As two-groups analysis is the most frequently used
statistical method in experimental research ​(Chochlac,
2018)​, the broad adoption of estimation for this type of
analysis would greatly advance its acceptance more
generally. However, while every major data-analysis tool
can perform a Student’s ​t​-test and chart NHST plots, very

few software packages offer estimation plots. To improve
the accessibility of estimation plots, we developed Data
Analysis with Bootstrap-coupled ESTimation (DABEST),
available in three open-source libraries for ​Matlab​,
Python​, and ​R​. DABEST calculates the sampling
distribution and the CI with bootstrapping: resampling
with replacement from the observations several
thousand times (​ Efron, 1979; Efron and Tibshirani, 1994)​.
Compared to parametric methods, bootstrapping is more
robust for data sets with non-normal distributions ​(Efron,
1981, 1987)​. We have also used DABEST to build a free,
user-friendly web application: ​estimationstats.com​. Data
is input via a spreadsheet, summary statistics are
downloadable as text tables, and plots can be saved in
image formats suitable for publication (PNG and SVG).
The default CI can be easily re-specified to accommodate
other interval sizes ​(Benjamin et al., 2017)​. With the web
application and open-source libraries, DABEST caters to
both scripting and spreadsheet workflows, empowering
all researchers to rapidly adopt better data-analysis
practices.

Figure 2. The estimation approach can accommodate a range of experimental designs
A.​ Estimation plots can effectively display datasets with large numbers of observations.
Shown here is a plot of the mean differences between two groups, each with 1000
observations. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of each group is plotted as a gapped line
(the ends of the vertical lines correspond to mean ± SD, while the mean itself is depicted as a
gap in the line) alongside all data points. Even larger samples are easily handled with related
designs: the ​violin plot ​(Hintze and Nelson, 1998)​ which shows the density of observed values;
or the sinaplot ​(Sidiropoulos et al., 2017)​ which controls the jitter width of the data points
according to each group’s density function.
B. ​An estimation plot with a slopegraph ​(Tufte, 2001)​ depicting the pairs of within-subject
observations and the ∆.

C. ​A multi-group estimation plot with multiple two-group comparisons plotted together. The
lower panel—which shows the effect sizes (Δs)—is analogous to a forest plot, summarising the
results of several comparisons. We propose multi-group estimation plots be named
‘Cumming plots’ after their originator ​(Cumming, 2012)​.
D. ​A shared-control plot. This is analogous to an ANOVA with multiple comparisons, where
several groups (in this case, three groups: Test 1, Test 2, and Test 3) are compared against a
single common control or reference group.

Estimation plots are versatile
DABEST can be used to visualize large samples (​Figure
2A​), paired data (​Figure 2B​), multiple groups (​Figure 2C​),
shared-control designs (​Figure 2D​), and to display
standardized effect sizes such as Hedges’ g. More
generally, estimation-focused plots can be used for
linear regression (​Figure 3​), and meta-research (e.g.
forest plots) ​(Borenstein et al., 2009)​. Thus, the
estimation approach is broadly relevant ​(Claridge-Chang
and Assam, 2016)​.
Conclusion
Estimation plots constitute an ​elegant, robust framework
for presenting data. The three software packages and
accompanying web application offer non-statisticians a
way to analyze their data without recourse to NHST,
which derails analysts from quantification and misleads
them to settle for superficial dichotomies. ​By visualizing
effect sizes and their precision, estimation plots help
analysts focus on quantitative thinking, enabling better
scientific practice.

Figure 3. The estimation approach to linear regression.
The principle of showing both observed values and effect size applies to other types of
estimation plots. Shown here is the example of a linear regression plot. A best-practice
visualization should include the following: (1) a scatter plot that shows all observations; (2) a
fit line with its confidence-interval band; (3) the slope effect size (​m​ in ​y​ = ​mx​ + ​c ​of the
regression fit line) with its confidence interval; and (4) the coefficient of determination effect
size (R​2​) with its confidence interval. These features of a regression plot are the counterparts
to the key aspects of estimation graphics for grouped data: dot plot; difference axis; ∆ value;
and standardized effect size (e.g. Cohen’s ​d​ or Hedges’ g) ​(Cohen, 1988; Hedges, 1981)​. Both ​m
and ∆ express a change in the dependent variable in terms of the independent
variable—continuous or categorical, respectively. Both R​2​ and ​d​ are indicators of the effect
size as a proportion of variance; indeed, there are formulas for the interconversion of R​2​ and
d-type effect sizes ​(Borenstein et al., 2009)​.
