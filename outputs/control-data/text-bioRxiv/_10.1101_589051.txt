Abstract

48

Background

49

Chagas disease (CD), typically confined to the Latin America (LA) region, is emerging

50

as a global health problem. In Japan, as in the rest of world, the under-diagnose rate of

51

CD is alarmingly high. Various studies have highlighted the importance of informed

52

knowledge in the seeking behavior. Educational integrative activities, with

53

consideration for socio-cultural factors, can help increase the knowledge of the

54

participants. There has been no studies that analyze the difference in knowledge, before

55

and after these educational activities. This study aimed to qualitatively and

56

quantitatively investigate the knowledge, behavior and attitude toward CD among LA

57

migrants in Japan and to evaluate the effectiveness of the community educational

58

activity in increasing knowledge of CD.

59

Methodology

60

This cross-sectional study involved two questionnaires to analyze the knowledge of the

61

LA migrant participants before and after the community activity (CA) in four cities in

62

Japan (Oizumi, Suzuka, Hadano, and Nagoya).

63

Principal Findings

64

A total of 75 participants were enrolled, predominantly Bolivians from hyperendemic

65

areas. The baseline knowledge of CD was low. However, most of them were familiar

66

with the disease although less than 10% of them had been tested for CD before. Living

67

in Japan for more than 10 years and previously being tested for CD were the factors

68

associated with better knowledge. The conducted CA significantly improved the

69

knowledge of the participants. They associated the term “Chagas” mostly with fear and

70

concern. In contrast to other studies, the level of stigmatization was low. The barriers in

71

care seeking behavior were language, migration process and difficulties to access to the

72

healthcare system.

73

Conclusion

74

Educational activities with integrative approach are useful to increase knowledge of

75

CD. The activity brings the possibility to explore not only the level of knowledge, but

76

also to reveal the experience and to understand the needs of the people at risk.

77

Author Summary

78

Though the incident rate of Chagas disease (CD) has fallen, more than 7 million people

79

are affected worldwide. The CD prevalence is under-estimated because just 1% of these

80

affected people can access to the diagnosis and treatment. This situation is maintaining

81

mainly for the lack of implication of socio-cultural factors in the interventions to

82

decrease the burden of the disease. Educational activities with integral approach are

83

useful to increase the knowledge of the people at risk. People that have being tested for

84

CD before or living in Japan for more than 10 years have better knowledge about the

85

disease, suggesting the importance of knowledge in the seeking behavior. The authors

86

recommend the implementation of educational activities with integral approach as a

87

strategy to improves the knowledge of Chagas disease among Latin America migrants

88

in Japan.

Introduction

90

It has been more than 100 years since the discovery of Chagas disease (CD) and although

91

the number of incident rate has fallen, more than 7 million people are affected worldwide.

92

The prevalence is under-estimated because just 1% of these affected people can access to

93

the diagnosis and treatment [1]. Each year 39,000 new cases occur of which 9,000 results

94

from congenital transmission [2]. In Latin America (LA), CD presents as one of the

95

tropical disease with the highest burden, which is measured in 806,170 disability-adjusted

96

life-years (DALYs). The economic impact is about 627 million dollars in health

97

expenditure worldwide [3].

98

As a result of increasing migration in the last few years, the disease silently

99

spreads into the United States, Europe and the Western Pacific region [4]. Japan ranks

100

third in the world for migrant population from LA. Brazilian, Peruvian and Bolivian

101

population represent the majority of the Latin American migrants living in Japan. In

102

Japan, there is an estimate of 3000 cases of CD. Nowadays, blood transfusion control

103

is implemented as the only one measure to control CD in Japan [5]. There is an

104

important gap in epidemiological data and cases reports, with most of the population

105

affected undiagnosed [6]

106

The fact that CD is an emerging disease in non-endemic countries, along with

107

the lack of awareness of the health personnel and its silent course, makes it difficult

108

for detection. In addition to this challenging situation, migrant population are exposed

109

to many barriers to access to the health system.

110

The migrant population has a disadvantageous situation compared with the native

111

citizens of the of the host country. Language, lack of adaptability of the health system

112

and priorization of their migratory goals in the process of care seeking behavior are

113

described as main barriers. Currently less than 10% of the people affected by CD are

114

diagnosed in non-endemic countries [1,7,8]. Some studies pointed it out that the lack

115

of knowledge of the people at risk have strong influence in the care seeking behavior.

116

It is important for the population at risk of contracting CD to have the necessary

117

knowledge to be able to combat it through their daily activities. However, to have

118

better outcomes, this knowledge should not be presented as information provided by

119

the scientific community. Such knowledge should be incorporated with the population

120

beliefs and conceptions [9]. Conceptions are the knowledge that each one must explain

121

and situate themselves in their environment. These are result of their history, their

122

environment, their cultural context, their reality and the interactions between all these

123

elements. Thus, the conceptions of who learns should become the starting point of any

124

educational project [10]. Furthermore, we know that the emergence and persistence of

125

CD associated with socio-cultural factors [11] . These are the reasons why educational

126

activities to improve the knowledge should involve an integrative approach and

127

consider the affected people as main actors. However, most of the interventions do not

128

combine all clinical, environmental, sociocultural aspects together. Incorporate the

129

experience of people affected can be an important tool for developing program with

130

better outcomes. An activity presented by the group Conicet “Hablamos de Chagas”

131

is an example of integrative approach where Chagas is considered in all aspects

132

(epidemiological, biomedical, political and sociocultural) [12]. To our knowledge

133

there is no study that analyze the improvement in knowledge of CD after these

134

educational activities.

135

The primary objectives of our study are to reveal the current knowledge and attitudes

136

towards CD in LA migrant population living in Japan; to analyse the factors associated

137

with better knowledge and to evaluate the effectiveness of a community activity in

138

increasing the knowledge of CD. The secondary objective is to identify possible

139

strategies to overcome existing barriers for the migrant population to access care.

140
141

Methods

142

Study design

143

This cross-sectional study involved both quantitative and qualitative methods. The

144

quantitative part was based in two questionnaires administered pre (first questionnaire)

145

and post (second questionnaire) an educational activity where CD was covered in an

146

integrative approach.

147

More than half of the questionnaire were based on two previous studies, one

148

conducted in United States to assess the awareness among LA migrant population living

149

in Los Angeles [13] and other in Geneva, Switzerland [14]. The qualitative part was based

150

on one of the educational activities proposed in the book “Hablamos de Chagas” by the

151

Conicet group “Taller I: Construcción colectiva del caleidoscopio”. We decided to

152

modify the videos proposed originally by Conicet group of this activity. Three of the

153

videos of Juana and Mateo: “Salud y Enfermedad”, “Pregnancy” and “Ciudad” were

154

chosen to adapt to the necessities of the migrant population living in non-endemic country

155

[12].

156

Study areas and study population

157

The activity was held from March to June of 2018 in four cities in central Japan:

158

Oizumi (Gunma prefecture), Hadano (Kanagawa prefecture), Nagoya (Aichi prefecture)

159

and Suzuka (Mie prefecture). They were selected for the high number of LA migrant

160

population. We sought 100 participants. Inclusion criteria were LA migrant adult

161

population (18 years old or more) who are residing in Japan.

163

Recruitment method

164

We collaborated with the Bolivian embassy who worked with the leader of the

165

community to recruit the participants. The activity was also informed by different media

166

directed to Latin-American migrant population living in Japan: radio, magazine and

167

social network. During the day of the activity, the people that came to the embassy for

168

other issues were invited to participate.

169

Data collection

170

After having signed the written informed consent, the first questionnaire was

171

administered to the participant after enrollment. Then the educational activity was

172

conducted. Finally, the second questionnaire including similar questions to the first

173

questionnaire was given. All the communication and education activities with the

174

participants were conducted in Spanish by a native speaker.

175

The discussion of the educative activity starts with the question “What is the first

176

thing that came to your mind when you hear the word “Chagas”?”. The participants wrote

177

what came in their mind in a piece of paper. It would be pasted in a mural divided in the

178

four dimensions of CD: biomedical, epidemiological, political and socio-cultural.

179

Constructing a kaleidoscopic image of the multidimensionality of CD helps discuss about

180

the problematic in a focal group discussion (FGD) format. Then, some videos of Juana

181

and Mateo was projected and recap of ideas from the videos was conducted [15]. The

182

activity followed with a discussion about barriers that migrant population found in Japan

183

and their suggestion to overcome these problems.

184

Variables

185

The first questionnaire contained 33 questions, 10 of them related to knowledge in the

186

disease. The first questionnaire included questions with regards to demographic

187

information: age, sex, education level, country and city of origin and place of residence.

188

There were questions related to the risk factors of CD: age, living in rural area, living in

189

adobe house, hearing about CD, having a family member who has CD, knowledge of the

190

vector, the risk of being infected by blood transfusion and any information for blood

191

transfusion in LA countries. In addition, there were question related to the risk of

192

transmission: risk of congenital and blood transfusion transmission and risk during the

193

time living in Japan. There were question related to the level of vigilance and policies for

194

CD, in their previous resident areas: living in another country, previously tested for CD

195

and previously treated. There were questions related to knowledge about CD: the

196

magnitude of the problem, severity, routes of transmission, existence of treatment,

197

epidemiology of the disease, symptomatology, difference between disease and positive

198

result of CD diagnostic test and efficacy of the treatment. Questions regarding barriers to

199

access the Health system in Japan and stigmatization were also included.

200

Data analysis

201

The total punctuation was 14.5. To analyse the quantitative data, cross tabulation was

202

conducted for questions not related to knowledge with Stata 2015. For the ones related to

203

knowledge, we calculated the total point of the first questionnaire and divided in 2 groups

204

with a cut off in 60%. To analyse the knowledge of the participants we use R core Team

205

(2018) R. Bivariate analysis was conducted for factors between two groups. The factors

206

with p value less than 0.2 were include in the multivariable analysis. Paired t-test was

207

conducted to analyse if there was improvement after the CA by comparing the total point

208

of people before and after. The FGD was transcribed verbatim in Spanish and translated

209

into English after for publication. Transcription were grouped into categories and by

210

groups to analyse. ArcGIS online was used to create the map that illustrate the Cities of

211

residence of the participants.

Description of the participants

222

A total of 75 participants were recruited into the study. The participants age ranged

223

between 20 and 70 years old, with a mean of 44.5 ± 13.2 years old. There were slightly

224

more women than men, 54,1% and 45.8%, respectively. Almost 95% of the women had

225

children. Most of the participants had secondary education (62.1%). The Bolivian

226

migrant population represents 95.5% of the participants. More than half of the

227

responders (57,6%) came from endemic areas for CD. The most common city of origin

228

was Santa Cruz in Bolivia (44%), followed by Riberalta (22%). Most of the participants

229

have been living in Japan for more than 10 years (81.1%). Mie prefecture and

230

Kanagawa prefecture had the highest number of participants (Fig. 1). In addition, 9.6%

231

of the participants came from other prefectures including Tokyo (n=8,8 %) and

232

Ishikawa (1.6%) (Table 1).

241

Most of the responders had heard about CD (82.2%). However, just five responders

242

(7.2%) had been tested for Chagas before. More than half of the responders came from

243

rural areas (60.3%). Nearly a third of the responders have lived in an adobe house

244

(31.67%). Most of the responders did not recognize the vector (63,5%). Out of the

245

people that saw the insect (n=27), 12 of them saw it at home.

246

In our study, 22.7% of the responders had at least one family members infected by CD.

247

Just two participants referred that their mothers were infected by CD. Regarding blood

248

transmission, 10% of the responders received blood transfusion in LA countries. Nearly

249

30% of the participants had donated blood previously (Fig. 2).

250
251

Stigmatization of the disease

252

Most of the responders would like to be tested (94.4%) and treated (97.2%) for CD, if

253

they had the opportunity. Nearly 30% would be worried if another person knew that

254

they had CD (Fig 2).

266

Baseline knowledge of the participants on Chagas disease. Our results showed that

267

the total score of knowledge was low with the average at 6.7 ± 2.5. However, the

268

participants could identify important points of the disease: epidemiology, transmission,

269

symptomatology and treatment of CD. Most of the participants identified CD as a

270

problem in LA countries (85.7%) and also in Japan (71.6%). Nearly 80% of them

271

believed that CD was a severe disease (79.4%) (Fig. 2).

272

Most of the responders knew that CD was endemic in LA (n=27, 42.2%) with slightly

273

difference in a second group that identified it worldwide (n=25, 39,0%). Nearly two

274

thirds of the responders were familiar with the vector-borne transmission in first place

275

(n=38). Most of the women (n=28, 84.8%) considered that the disease can affect their

276

children if they are infected, just (n=12, 38.2%) of them answered vertical transmission

277

as a possible route. Low knowledge about the oral transmission was reported between

278

the participants. No misidentification of person to person route as hugs and kisses were

279

answered by the responders.

280

A majority of the responders identify cardiac disease as a symptom of CD (n=53,

281

91.4%). Cardiac disease alone was the most popular answer with 58.6% of the answers

282

(n=34). The next most answer was heart and digestive problems, both as part of the

283

symptom of CD (n=17, 29.3%).

284

Two third of the responders considered a positive result to be interpreted as sick

285

(n=40, 66,6%). Just 20% (n=12%) of the responders differentiated between infection

286

and disease. Most of the responders (n=53, 79.1%) knew that there was treatment for

287

CD and 69.2% (n=36) of them know that is not useful in severe cases.

288

Factors associated with better knowledge. Bivariable analysis showed that

289

participants who had been living longer in Japan, heard about the disease, and had been

290

tested for Chagas were significantly associated with the higher knowledge (P-value ≤

291

0.2). Our multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that longer living in Japan

292

and prior test of Chagas were independently associated with the higher knowledge.

293

Participants who lived in Japan for more than 10 years were 8 times (OR = 8.42,

294

95%CI: 1.56-48.62) more likely to be knowledgeable on CD than those who lived for

295

shorter time. Participants who had been tested for CD were eleven times (OR. 11.32;

296

95%CI. 1.52-105.9) more likely to be knowledgeable on CD.

Knowledge improvement after community activities. Sixty-one participants (out of

307

75) participated the CA (81.3%), while three people left the activity earlier and 11

308

arrived late to the venue. Among 61 participants participated in the CA, 50 (82%) of

309

them performed the Questionnaire 1 and 2 (Fig. 3).

314
315

Our paired sample t-test indicated an improvement in total knowledge of participants on

316

CD (mean knowledge score: post-activities 9.8 ± 2.6 vs. pre- activities 6.7 ± 2.5, P-

317

value < 0.0001; 95% CI: 2.32-3.84).

318

Before the community activities, only 32% of the participants (n=16) exhibited a high

319

knowledge, however, 70% of the participants (n=35) had the high knowledge after the

320

CA. As a result, more than 80% of the responders improved their punctuation after the

321

activity (n=43, 86%). Just 2% (n=1) had worse punctuation after the CA and 12% (n=6)

322

did not improved. Among the group that improved, the increase in points ranged from

323

0.5 to 10. Among the group that decreased their punctuation, the average reduction in

324

point was 2.5.

325
326

Qualitative analysis

327

Baseline knowledge. The responders were familiar with the disease and had prior

328

knowledge about the epidemiology, vector-borne transmission and cardiac problems

329

(S1 Table). Most of the participants were familiar with the word “Chagas”. They

330

located the disease in their countries and their habits related to the high-attitude tropical

331

areas. None was familiar with the flow of the disease into non-endemic areas (PC1 and

332

2).

333

The vector-borne transmission was most frequently identified as the only way of

334

transmission. Some people who recognized blood transfusion as a way of transmission

335

had the experience of a relative that was diagnosed during blood donation. Since they

336

couldn't donate blood, they associated the transmission with blood transfusion. Other

337

routes as mother to child, organ transplantation or oral route were not considered before

338

they were given information about it (PC3-4).

339

The participants identified the symptom of the disease mostly with cardiac

340

problems. Digestive problem was less recognized but also was commented during FGD

341

(PC5-7).

342

What is the first word that came to your mind when I say “Chagas”? The most

343

frequent answer was related to the feelings of fears, worries and memories.

344

Fear. The fear was linked to CD for many participants. They expressed to have it for

345

lack of information, for the severity of the disease and the belief fast death. Other

346

participants manifested the fear of being ill out of their country of origin as a migrant

347

(PC8-9).

348

Worries. Concerns were expressed for the transmission of the disease to their relatives.

349

Women expressed more the concern when they learnt about the possibility of mother to

350

child transmission (PC10-11).

351

Memories. The memories expressed during the FGD were related to the recent cases of

352

CD that they experienced and were linked to feelings as fear or pain (PC12-13).

353

They also associated with the vector “vinchuca” and related with symptoms. The

354

symptoms described were non-specific, related with pains or heart problems (PC14-15).

355

Attitudes

available under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

356

Normalization. Most of the participants never had been tested and they did not ask for

357

the diagnosis test of Chagas. They represented a situation of normalization

358

/naturalization of the disease (PC16). The fact of being sick or having some difficulties

359

in the day life after the age of 50 was considered normal by the participants (PC17).

360

Stigmatization. During the FGD, the stigmatization of the disease did not become as a

361

topic or commentary. When asked directly if they think that stigmas existed around CD

362

or what they thought about the fact that some communities expressed stigma of

363

CD, they denied the existence of stigmas. However, two participants thought

364

differently. A participant expressed a situation of stigmatization, because of misbeliefs

365

related to the route of transmission (PC18-19).

366

Resignation. Commentaries of resignation in front of a situation where death is

367

inescapable had been described during FGD. This participant described the resignation

368

in front a possibility to be infected linked to severe development of illness (PC20).

369

Barriers

370

Even most of the participants were satisfied with the health system in Japan.

371

Participants identify barriers related to the language, the cost of healthcare and

372

familiarity with the health system in Japan that may affect the care seeking behavior of

373

the participants. Also, their prioritization of the job as the main tool of support in a

374

foreign country hindered them from getting care (PC21).

375
376
377

Language was described as one of the main barriers. They complained about the
accuracy of the official translations and lack of intimacy (PC22).
They expressed prioritization other issues related with their migratory goals and

378

not related to health if it was not necessary. Keeping the job position was one of the

379

most important priorities (PC23-24).

380

The participants expressed problems in access to the health services. They were

381

asked for more information if they wanted to make the diagnostic test of Chagas. They

382

expressed the need to have the information in Spanish (P25).

383

Participants proposals to overcome the actual problematic

384

Most of the participants claimed that more information should be provided. The

385

participants considered that the spread of information in Spanish and by different media

386

was an intervention that could improve the situation of CD in Japan. They proposed

387

using the Internet as the most effective way to transmit information and offered a

388

development of a website in Spanish with translated information. Furthermore, it is

389

suggested to perform distribution of brochures or activities like the one held in our

390

study in venues where LA migrant population tended to gather such as church, Latino

391

meetings or health centers (PC26)

392
393
394

They expressed the importance to distribute information not just for people at
risk, but also between the health sector personnel (PC27).
The participants highlighted the importance to have enough information before

395

having the Chagas test. They remarked the need for accessible diagnosis, treatment and

396

system of care (PC28-29).

397

Discussion

398

To our knowledge, no study has analyzed the effect of educational activities in CD

399

related to the knowledge of the participants. The fact that this activity included the

400

participants as the main actors by sharing their knowledge and experiences, could have

401

an important impact on the improvement of knowledge.

402

One of the factors that clearly had a significant influence on acquiring a high

403

knowledge was being tested for CD in the past. People that had been tested before

404

for CD had more information about the disease resulting a change in their care

405

seeking behavior. One study conducted in Spain described that knowledge about the

406

treatment efficacy could influence the decision to get the test of CD [16]. In our

407

study, all participants who had been previously tested for CD were women, except

408

one. This can be influenced by their reproductive role, as it was explained in other

409

studies [17,11]. Living in Japan for more than 10 years also enhanced the knowledge

410

probably due to the decrease of infested houses in the recent years in Bolivia and the

411

urbanization of the population, along with the lack of prevention and care

412

interventions [18,19]. This population migrated more than 10 years ago was more

413

familiar with the vector. The urbanization of the population was proposed as a

414

phenomenon that affected the awareness of the disease for its visualization in an area

415

far from the traditional ruralism [20,11].

416

Similar to the result of other studies about CD knowledge of LA migrants, the baseline

417

knowledge of our participants was low [21-24]. Due to high representation of Bolivian

418

population recruited, results of our study were more similar to Blasco- Hernandez et al.

419

study, conducted in Madrid in a group of Bolivian women [16]. The participants of our

420

study had knowledge of CD including vector habitat, epidemiology, transmission by

421

vector-borne and the cardiac problems associated with CD. The knowledge of blood

422

transfusion transmission was achieved from previous experiences of having a relative

423

diagnosed by CD during blood donation. Low knowledge of mother-to-child

424

transmission was found in the women of our study. Therefore, this area required

425

essential improvement to reduce new cases. Oral transmission was rarely considered as

426

a way of transmission, which was indicated in another study [25]. Endemic countries

427

have focused on reduction of the infestation by the vector; however, there are still lack

428

of programs to control other ways of transmission, which can influence the awareness

429

of the people.

430

Knowledge about symptoms and significance of a positive diagnosis were not achieved

431

as baseline knowledge, as in the study of Blasco-Hernandez [16]. Many participants

432

clarified the symptom as suffering for unspecific pain. The association with pain was

433

also expressed in children in endemic area [25]. This may be influenced by the non-

434

specificity of the CD clinic. The course of the disease is not well-known and it is

435

irremediable associated with high mortality. The main difference with the study of

436

Blasco-Hernandez et al., is that our participants were not CD-diagnosed population.

437

Despite the prior knowledge about the disease, only 7.2% of the participants had been

438

previously tested for CD. Most of the studies explained the low rate of diagnosis by the

439

implication of socio-cultural factors on the representation of the disease. The most

440

common factors are the stigmatization and the normalization of the disease

441

[11,12,16,17, 20,21,26,27].

442

Dissemination of the information about CD was considered one of the most important

443

strategies for improving the seeking for care. It was remarked by other studies

444

conducted in non-endemic countries [24]. As in other studies, religious meetings, social

445

association and graphic materials was proposed for disseminate information. However,

446

it was proposed that the Internet was the most effective way to provide the information.

447

Most of the population at risk of CD are highly stigmatized and have experienced

448

discrimination. However, our participants showed a low level of stigmatization. One of

449

the possible explanations is that most of them migrated at the age of 30 years-old. They

450

remembered cases of CD of old relatives, but not proximal generation. This might make

451

them less familiar to the reality of CD in their socio-cultural context and feel less

452

vulnerable. Another possible explanation is that most of our participants were not

453

diagnosed with CD, in contrast with other studies that shows a high level of

454

stigmatization [28]. As in most of the populations analyzed for CD, our participants

21

455

showed a high level of normalization/naturalization of the disease. The un-specificity of

456

symptoms and the lack of impact on day-to-day activities as described in many studies

457

contributes to the normalization of the disease. Also, similar to the study by Blasco-

458

Hernandez et al, the participants of our study were normalized to be ill at the age of 50.

459

The low social-relevance of CD was influenced by the low expected age of life in

460

Bolivia in the last decade. However, this data is changing nowadays [28].

461

The representation of the disease for the participants were similar to the one

462

described previous studies. They presented a disease caused by the “vinchuca”, an

463

insect that affects the heart and leads in a high mortality. The reactions and associations

464

with CD after this representation, were predominated by feelings of fears, worries, and

465

memories of affected relatives. As previously described, this emotional burden led to

466

the attitudes of resignation until the irremediable in some participants. The long period

467

asymptomatic and a late diagnosis contributed to the maintenance of this representation.

468

This study was conducted in Japan, a country that has an important gap in

469

epidemiological data for CD. The literature of CD in Japan is limited to cases report and

470

one study of prevalence in the Brazilian population [29]. This is the first study to

471

analyze the LA migrant population living in Japan, as a population at risk of CD.

472

However, most of participants were Bolivians. This representation could cause a

473

recruitment bias, since the Embassy of Bolivia was the only embassy to be part of the

474

study. Santa Cruz was the most popular area of origin. This was expected because the

475

migration in the Japanese citizens to Bolivia after the second world war II. They were

476

installed in the district of Santa Cruz, a high endemic area. Two Japanese colonies near

477

the city of Santa Cruz were founded in the 50s, “Okinawa Colony” and “San Juan of

478

Yapacaní Colony”.

479

As migrant population, several barriers were identified in the process of seeking

480

for health care in Japan. Preconceptions conceived in the country of origin may act as a

481

barrier in the host country. The barriers found in Japan included language barrier,

482

migratory process, and difficulties to access the health care system. These results are

483

similar to the barriers experienced by the LA migrant population in other non-endemic

484

countries [30, 11, 17, 31].

485

Barriers of accessing to the health system for migrants are highly documented

486

in different studies. The lack of adaptability to facilitate the access of migrant

487

population is constant in host countries [17, 21, 31, 32, 33]. In our study, most of the

488

participants had not known where to seek for care in case of desire to be tested for

489

CD. This can be responsible by the organization of the Health System in Japan,

490

where the role of family doctor is uncommon, which adds difficulties for the people

491

at risk to find the integrative care for a disease such as Chagas.

492

On the other hand, there has still not been study conducted in Japan to

493

analyze the knowledge of Japanese doctors about tropical diseases. However, this

494

knowledge is expected to be low as happening in most of the non-endemic countries

495

[34].

496

The understanding of the implications of social and cultural factors described

497

in care seeking behavior of the migrant population is a key for designing policies,

498

control and preventive interventions. These interventions should avoid the traditional

499

specific disease-centered due to the low impact on the population [11].

500

One of the main strengths of this study is the transnational approach. Most of

501

the participants were not tested for CD before. It provides a naïve vision of the

502

knowledge, conceptions and representations of the disease in the population at risk.

503

The study was conducted in Spanish by a native speaker to ensure the cultural

504

competence and the feasibility of the data in the qualitative part.

505

We did not identify the most successful gathering method. However, most of

506

the participants coming to the venue had some other issues to resolve with the

507

Embassy of Bolivia. It leads in a low representation of other LA countries with high

508

representation in Japan such as Brazil, Peru and Argentina. This can lead to a

509

possible recruitment bias. Also, the activities were held on Saturday, which is a

510

working day in Japan. The questionnaires used in this study were mostly based on

511

previous studies. However, it has not been validated. This activity demonstrates an

512

increase of knowledge. However, it could have a memory bias and we did not

513

identify the impact of the impact of knowledge on care seeking behavior. The

514

population that did not participate in the community activity were much younger

515

than the participated ones. Improvement should be designed to reach to young

516

population. A virtual format in networks, a more actual way of communication or

517

approaches in venues which are more familiar to teenagers such as schools or

518

activity clubs should be considered.

519

In conclusion, educational activities with integral approach are useful to

520

increase the knowledge of CD. This activity brings the possibility to explore not only

521

the knowledge but also the characteristic, experiences, opinions and needs of those at

522

risk. This information is essential in order to guide the efforts to improve the CD

523

problem, considering the people at risk as part of the improvement and development.

524

However, the effectiveness of this activity should be evaluated in different

525

geographical areas. Longitudinal research will bring more information on how the
