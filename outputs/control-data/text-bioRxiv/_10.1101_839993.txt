Abstract
Understanding factors contributing to individual differences in vulnerability to opioid
addiction is essential for developing more effective preventions and treatments, yet few reliable
behavioral predictors of subsequent opioid self-administration have been identified in rodents.
Sensitivity to the acute effects of initial drug exposure predicts later addiction vulnerability in
both humans and animals, but the relationship of sensitivity to withdrawal from initial drug
exposure and later drug use vulnerability is unclear. The goal of the current study was to
evaluate whether the degree of anhedonia experienced during withdrawal from early opioid
exposure predicts subsequent vulnerability to opioid addiction. Rats were first tested for
withdrawal sensitivity following acute injections of morphine (i.e., “acute dependence”),
measured as elevations in intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) thresholds (anhedonia-like
behavior) during naloxone-precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal. Rats were then tested for
addiction vulnerability using various measures of i.v. morphine self-administration (MSA)
including acquisition, demand, extinction, and reinstatement induced by morphine, stress,
and/or drug-associated cues. Greater naloxone-precipitated withdrawal across repeated
morphine injections and greater peak spontaneous withdrawal severity following a single
morphine injection were associated with lower addiction vulnerability on multiple MSA
measures. Withdrawal-induced anhedonia predicted a wider range of MSA measures than did
any individual measure of MSA itself.

These data suggest that high anhedonia during

withdrawal from initial opioid exposure is protective against subsequent opioid addiction
vulnerability in rodents, thereby establishing one of the first behavioral measures to predict
individual differences in opioid SA.

This model promises to be useful for furthering our

understanding of behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms underlying vulnerability to opioid
addiction.

1. Introduction
Opioid addiction poses a substantial burden on public health [1, 2]. Identifying behavioral
and neurobiological factors contributing to the marked individual differences in opioid addiction
vulnerability is essential for developing more effective preventions and treatments [3, 4].
However, few behavioral measures have been identified in preclinical models that reliably
predict individual differences in i.v. opioid self-administration (SA). SA is often considered a
“gold standard” for modeling addiction in animals because it involves volitional drug
consumption as occurs in humans.
Sensitivity to the initial acute effects of drugs (e.g., euphoria, aversion) is a key predictor
of addiction vulnerability in humans [5 - 7]. Furthermore, several preclinical studies indicate that
sensitivity to the initial effects of acute drug injections (e.g., locomotor activity or depression,
antinociception) predict voluntary drug intake in an i.v. SA model [8 - 10]. Acute drug injections
also produce negative affective (emotional) states (e.g., anhedonia, or diminished reward
sensitivity) during withdrawal. These withdrawal effects are induced even after a single drug
exposure in both humans and animals (“acute dependence”; [11, 12, 13]), and often become
more severe with repeated drug exposures [14 - 16]. Some authors have proposed that greater
sensitivity to the negative affective consequences of withdrawal may be protective against
addiction [17 - 21], and that anhedonia may reduce the motivation for reward-seeking [22].
Consistent with these predictions, we found that saccharin-preferring rats, which exhibit greater
SA of opioids and other drugs [23], exhibit lower anhedonia during morphine withdrawal as
measured by increases in intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) thresholds (i.e., withdrawalinduced anhedonia, WIA) [19]. Nevertheless, the relationship between sensitivity to withdrawal
from acute opioid exposure and opioid SA has not been directly tested within the same animals
or in outbred rats, which can differ from selectively bred rats in terms of determinants of
addiction vulnerability [24, 25].

The goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of WIA to predict individual differences
in subsequent i.v. morphine SA (MSA) in outbred rats. Several different measures of MSA (e.g.,
acquisition, demand, reinstatement) were used because they model distinct aspects of addiction
and can be differentially associated with other behavioral predictors of drug SA [26, 27]. It was
hypothesized that greater WIA severity would be associated with lower MSA vulnerability.

2. Materials and Methods
Overview of experimental protocol
Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats (see Supplementary Material for additional information)
were tested under the experimental protocol shown in Figure 1. Rats were first tested for WIA
during naloxone-precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal from acute morphine injections
(Phase 1). Rats were then tested for opioid addiction vulnerability using several measures of
i.v. MSA including acquisition, elasticity of demand, and reinstatement (Phase 2). Finally, WIA
was again tested after the completion of the MSA protocol to provide a preliminary
characterization of the relationship between MSA and withdrawal sensitivity during a more
advanced stage of dependence ("late-stage dependence", Phase 3). All procedures were
approved by The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Hennepin Health
Research Institute in accordance with the 2011 NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and the 2003 National Research Council Guidelines for the Care and Use of Mammals
in Neuroscience and Behavioral Research.

Acute dependence
Rats (N = 61) were prepared and trained on a discrete-trial ICSS procedure (see
Supplemental Material) in daily sessions conducted Mon-Fri until ICSS thresholds were stable
(<10% variability over 5 days) and habituated to saline injections as described previously (see
[28]). On the first test day, rats were injected with morphine sulfate (MOR, 0 or 5.6 mg/kg, s.c.,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/839993; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

expressed as the salt). One hour and fifty minutes later, rats were injected with the opioid
antagonist naloxone (NX, 0 or 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) and tested for ICSS 10 minutes later. These
morphine and naloxone doses and this pretreatment interval produce significant negative
affective morphine withdrawal signs, including WIA [12, 15, 19]. Immediately after ICSS testing,
somatic withdrawal signs were assessed as a secondary withdrawal measure (see
Supplementary Material). There was a total of 4 groups in a 2 (MOR dose) x 2 (NX dose)
factorial design. The MOR + NX group (n = 29) was larger than the MOR + SAL, SAL + NX,
and SAL + SAL groups (n = 10-11/group) in order to have adequate power for correlation
analysis (see below). These procedures were repeated each day for 5 consecutive days.
Animals were then tested for ICSS under drug-free conditions for at least one week and until
ICSS thresholds were stable (same stability criteria as above).
To test spontaneous withdrawal, rats received a single injection of 5.6 mg/kg MOR
(MOR+NX and MOR+SAL groups) or 0 mg/kg MOR (SAL+NX and SAL+SAL groups) and ICSS
was tested 2, 6, 26, 30, 50, 64, 74, 98, and 170 hours later. The purpose of the 2 hour time
point was to detect any reinforcement-facilitating (ICSS threshold-lowering) effects of morphine
itself (see [29]). The selection of subsequent time points was based on the time course of
spontaneous withdrawal from acute morphine exposure determined using ICSS and other
measures [11, 30, 31]. Somatic withdrawal signs were recorded after ICSS testing at only the
26 hour time point. ICSS testing was then suspended.

Locomotor activity
Within 48 hours after the final ICSS test, locomotor activity in a novel environment (i.e.,
“sensation-seeking” [32 – 34]) was tested for 2 hours as a secondary predictor of MSA (see [35]
for detailed description of the apparatus).

MSA
Approximately 24-48 hours after completion of the locomotor activity test, animals from
all groups were implanted with i.v. catheters using our standard procedures [34]. Rats from the
control groups (SAL + SAL, etc.) were included in this phase to determine whether a history of
withdrawal testing impacted subsequent MSA in the MOR + NX group. Following a 7-10 day
recovery period, all rats were allowed to acquire i.v. morphine SA (0.2 mg/kg/inf) during daily 2
hr sessions conducted Mon-Fri using our standard apparatus and procedures (see
Supplementary Material). Rats were tested under a fixed ratio (FR) 1 schedule for at least 10
sessions and until acquisition criteria were met (≥5 infusions per session, ≤20% coefficient of
variation, and ≥ 2:1 response ratio on the active lever to inactive lever) across 3 sessions. To
test elasticity of demand (reinforcing efficacy), the FR requirement was increased every 3-4
sessions as follows: FR 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, and doubled thereafter until infusion rates during the last
2 sessions at a given FR were reduced by 90% compared to baseline (FR 1). Morphine
consumption under this protocol is well described by the current exponential demand function
[35]. Data from Mondays were excluded from data analysis due to spontaneous recovery of
responding after the weekend, which was often observed at high unit prices. Therefore, if one
of the three sessions at a given FR occurred on a Monday, rats were tested in an additional
session at that FR.
After completion of demand testing, rats were allowed to reacquire MSA under an FR1
schedule for at least 5 sessions and until MSA was stable (same stability criteria as above).
Extinction conditions were subsequently introduced in which the morphine dose was replaced
with saline and the drug-associated cue light was no longer presented upon infusion. Extinction
was tested for at least 10 sessions and until animals exhibited a 75% reduction in active lever
pressing for 2 consecutive sessions.
To test morphine- and cue-induced reinstatement, rats were injected s.c. on separate
days with either saline or morphine (1.0 mg/kg) 10 min prior to the SA session. This morphine

dose and pretreatment interval reliably reinstated drug-seeking in our lab (data not shown) and
others [36]. Responses on the active lever resulted in a saline infusion and either presentation
of the drug-associated cue light (“cue” condition) or no programmed consequences (“no cue”
condition). Reinstatement testing was therefore conducted using a 2 (morphine dose) x 2 (cue
condition) design, resulting in a total of 4 reinstatement tests. These tests were conducted on
Tuesdays and Fridays, provided that active lever pressing returned to extinction levels during
the preceding session, and the order of reinstatement conditions was counterbalanced.
Following completion of morphine- and cue-induced induced reinstatement testing, rats were
tested under extinction conditions for at least 5 sessions and until extinction criteria were again
met. To test stress- and cue-induced reinstatement, the above procedure was repeated except
that rats were injected i.p. with either deionized water or the stress-inducing α2-adrenergic
antagonist yohimbine (2.5 mg/kg) 30 min prior to each SA test. This dose of yohimbine and
pretreatment interval reliably reinstate extinguished SA [37].

Late-stage dependence
Following completion of all MSA procedures, rats were again tested for ICSS until
thresholds were stable. Rats (N = 26) were subsequently tested for precipitated (MOR + NX: n =
14, n = 4/group for other groups) and spontaneous (MOR + NX: n = 11, n = 2-4/group for other
groups) morphine withdrawal as described above. The small group sizes for this exploratory
phase reflect the considerable attrition rate by this stage of the protocol (see below).

Statistical analysis
ICSS.

ICSS thresholds (a measure of brain reinforcement function) and response

latencies (a measure of non-specific motoric effects [38]) during naloxone-precipitated and
spontaneous withdrawal were measured as percentage of baseline (average of the last 5 days
prior to onset of withdrawal testing). To provide a composite measure of naloxone-precipitated

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/839993; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

withdrawal severity for each animal, standardized composite z-scores were determined based
on average and peak ICSS thresholds during all 5 precipitated withdrawal tests, as well as
degree of sensitization of WIA (the difference score in ICSS thresholds between test days 1 and
5). Pearson’s correlation was used to confirm that composite z-scores correlated significantly
with all individual measures of WIA [see 39, 40].

Spontaneous withdrawal severity was

measured as peak withdrawal severity during hours 6 – 98 after morphine injection.

This

measure accounts for the considerable individual differences in the time course of changes in
ICSS thresholds during spontaneous withdrawal [see 41]. In the few cases where rats failed to
respond for any ICSS current intensity, we arbitrarily assigned ICSS threshold and latency
values based on those obtained in the animal achieving the highest ICSS threshold in that
phase of the experiment [see 42, 43].
MSA. MSA acquisition was measured as the mean number of infusions per session
during the first 10 days of acquisition. To determine opioid reinforcing efficacy during FR
escalation, exponential demand curve analyses were conducted as described in detail
elsewhere [35, 44]. Our primary demand measure, α, refers to the rate of change in
consumption with increases in unit price (elasticity of demand), with higher α values indicating
lower reinforcement efficacy. Zero values in consumption were replaced with 0.01 (1/10th of our
lowest non-zero consumption level) to provide better curve fits and more accurate parameter
estimates of demand for individual rats [see 33, 45, 46]. α values were log-transformed due to
non-normal distribution. Extinction was measured as mean number of infusions per session
during the first 10 sessions of extinction. Degree of reinstatement was defined as the difference
between active and inactive lever responses during each reinstatement test. To control for nonspecific active lever pressing, reinstatement scores during the control condition (Vehicle + No
cue) were subtracted from the reinstatement scores for the other conditions (Morphine + Cue,
etc.) for correlational analyses.

All statistical analyses and graphing were performed in GraphPad Prism 7 or R 3.4.3,
with significance level set at α = 0.05 for all tests. In general, data were analyzed using ANOVA
followed by Holm-Sidak’s or Dunnet’s multiple comparison tests (see Results for more details).
Relationships between ICSS and MSA measures were assessed using Pearson’s correlation.
3. Results
Attrition
Several animals were lost to attrition during the course of the protocol due to loss of
ICSS headcap, loss of stability of ICSS thresholds, failure to acquire MSA, loss of catheter
patency, health issues, or other problem. Data for these animals are analyzed only for those
phases they completed.

Acute dependence
Precipitated withdrawal: ICSS. Baseline ICSS thresholds did not differ between groups
(Table S1). A two-way ANOVA on ICSS thresholds during precipitated withdrawal revealed a
significant main effect of group (F (3, 54) = 36.62, p < 0.0001), a marginally significant main
effect of session (F (4, 216) = 2.34, p = 0.06), and a significant interaction between group and
session (F (12, 216) = 3.181, p = 0.0003). Dunnett’s multiple comparisons indicated that ICSS
thresholds were significantly elevated in the MOR+NX group compared to SAL+SAL controls
during all 5 sessions (all q ≥ 3.162, all p ≤ 0.005). In contrast, thresholds in the MOR+SAL and
SAL+NX groups did not differ from the SAL + SAL group during any session (Figure 2A). A
repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of session in the MOR+NX rats (F
(2.863, 77.30) = 18.40, p < 0.001), with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons indicating significantly
higher ICSS thresholds during sessions 2-5 compared to session 1 (all q ≥ 4.68, all p ≤ 0.001).
In contrast, there was no effect of session in any of the control groups (all p > 0.05).

No significant differences were observed in baseline ICSS response latencies between
groups (Table S1). Latencies also did not differ between groups during precipitated withdrawal
testing (Figure 2B), indicating the absence of non-specific (e.g., motoric) effects.

Spontaneous withdrawal: ICSS. Baseline ICSS thresholds did not differ between groups
(Table S1). ICSS threshold data during hours 2 (i.e., acute effect of MOR itself) and hours 6 –
98 (i.e., withdrawal period) of spontaneous withdrawal did not differ between the two groups
receiving MOR (MOR + NX and MOR + SAL groups) or between the two groups receiving SAL
(SAL + SAL and SAL + NX groups). Therefore, data from these groups were combined into
single MOR (n = 37) and SAL (n = 20) groups for further analysis. Welch’s corrected t-test
showed no significant difference in ICSS thresholds between MOR and SAL rats 2 hours after
injection (MOR: 107.7 ±5.35%; SAL: 100.4 ± 2.50%), indicating that MOR iself did not affect
ICSS. Two-way ANOVA on ICSS thresholds during spontaneous withdrawal 6-98 hours after
morphine injection revealed a significant main effect of time (F (7, 385) = 4.831, p < 0.0001) and
group (morphine vs. saline) (F (1, 55) = 4.012, p = 0.05), but no significant interaction (Figure
2C). After correcting for multiple comparisons, ICSS did not significantly differ between groups
at any individual time-point post injection. However, peak ICSS threshold values between hours
6 and 98 (regardless of the time point at which they occurred) differed significantly between the
morphine (117.1 ± 2.15%) and saline (110.4 ± 1.63%) groups (Welch-corrected t(54.9) = 2.50, p
= 0.02).
No significant differences were observed in ICSS response latencies between groups
during baseline sessions (Table S1), 2 hours after injection (MOR: 103.2 ± 3.01%; SAL: 96.43 ±
1.82%), or during spontaneous withdrawal (Figure 2D).

Precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal: Somatic signs.

Somatic withdrawal signs

were significantly elevated in the MOR + NX group during precipitated withdrawal, and in the
MOR condition during spontaneous withdrawal (Supplementary Material, Figure S1).

MSA in the Mor + NX Group
Acquisition (n = 29). Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of lever (active
vs inactive) (F (1, 28) = 58.38, p < 0.0001) and session (F (9, 252) = 2.896, p = 0.003) on
responses during the first 10 days of acquisition (Figure 3A). Sidak’s multiple comparison test
showed significantly higher responses on the active lever during all acquisition sessions (all t ≥
4.88, all p < 0.0001).
Demand (n = 25). Increases in FR requirement resulted in a progressive reduction in
morphine consumption (Figure 3B). A one-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a
significant effect of FR on number of morphine infusions (F (3.59, 82.63) = 79.43, p < 0.0001). A
post-hoc Dunnett's multiple comparisons test showed that infusions at all subsequent FRs were
significantly lower than at FR 1 (all q ≥ 4.23, all p ≤ 0.002). Morphine consumption during
demand testing was well-described by an exponential demand function, with R2 values typically
≥ 0.80 for individual animals (Table S2) and R2 = 0.94 for rats as a group, with considerable
individual variability in elasticity of demand (see Figure 3C).
Extinction (n = 24). Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of session
on infusion rates during extinction (F (3.64, 83.61) = 38.12, p > 0.001; Figure 3D). A post-hoc
Dunnett’s test showed that infusions at all sessions after session 1 were significantly reduced
compared to pre-extinction (baseline) levels (all p < 0.01).
Morphine- and cue-induced reinstatement (n = 23). A one-way repeated measures
ANOVA of reinstatement scores during morphine- and cue-induced reinstatement showed an
overall effect of treatment (F(1.12, 24.73) = 18.18, p < 0.001) (Figure 3E). The Holm-Sidak’s
multiple comparisons test revealed that the MOR + NO CUE, VEH + CUE and MOR + CUE

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/839993; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

conditions all resulted in significantly higher reinstatement scores compared to the VEH + NO
CUE condition (all t ≥ 4.82, all p < 0.001). MOR+CUE resulted in significantly higher
reinstatement than VEH + CUE (t = 3.83, p = 0.002) and MOR + NO CUE (t = 3.80, p = 0.002).
Stress- and cue-induced reinstatement (n = 22). There was an overall effect of treatment
on reinstatement scores during stress-and cue-induced reinstatement (F(1.68, 35.35) = 8.92, p
= 0.001) (Figure 3F). The Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test revealed that VEH + CUE (t =
5.98, p < 0.001) and YOH + CUE treatment (t = 3.75, p = 0.006) resulted in higher reinstatement
scores than the VEH + NO CUE control condition, whereas the YOH + NO CUE condition did
not. Responding during YOH + CUE reinstatement was significantly higher than during the
YOH + NO CUE condition (t = 3.17, p = 0.02), but did not differ from the VEH + CUE condition.

Correlations in the MOR + NX group
Composite z-scores for ICSS thresholds during precipitated withdrawal were significantly
correlated with all individual measures: peak ICSS threshold (r = 0.92, p < 0.001), average ICSS
threshold (r = 0.86, p < 0.001) and degree of sensitization of WIA (r = 0.54, p = 0.003). This
validates our use of z-scores to measure cumulative precipitated withdrawal severity [see 39,
40].

Pearson’s r revealed that greater composite WIA severity during precipitated withdrawal

correlated with lower infusions during acquisition of MSA and higher elasticity of demand (i.e.,
lower reinforcing efficacy) (Table 1, Figure S2). Greater peak ICSS threshold elevation during
spontaneous withdrawal was associated with lower acquisition and reinstatement induced by
morphine alone or morphine + cue (Table 1, Figure S3), and marginally correlated with elasticity
of demand (p = 0.06, Figure S3). Most MSA measure correlated significantly with at least one
other MSA measure (Table 1). However, no individual MSA measure correlated with as wide a
range of other MSA measures as did WIA (Table 1).

Secondary correlations in the MOR + NX group

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/839993; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

There were no significant correlations between any of the secondary predictors (i.e.,
somatic signs during acute dependence testing, locomotor activity) and any measure of MSA
(all p-values > 0.05, data not shown).

MSA in control groups
Rats in the control groups did not differ from the MOR + NX group on any primary MSA
measure (see Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).

Late-stage dependence
ICSS thresholds were significantly elevated during precipitated withdrawal during latestage dependence (Figure S5), while somatic signs were significantly elevated during
spontaneous withdrawal (Figure S5). However, these effects were not correlated with most MSA
measures (see Supplementary Materials)

4. Discussion
Greater WIA during antagonist-precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal in an acute
dependence model was associated with lower vulnerability on multiple measures of subsequent
i.v. MSA (e.g., elasticity of demand, reinstatement). In fact, WIA predicted a wider range of MSA
measures than did any individual measure of MSA. These findings are consistent with the
principle that initial drug sensitivity is an important predictor of subsequent drug use [e.g., 1, 2,
3], and also support the notion that drug withdrawal sensitivity may be protective against drug
addiction [17, 19, 47]. Our findings with outbred rats also complement findings of lower WIA in
rats bred for high saccharin consumption [19], a line that exhibits greater SA of opioids and
other drugs [23]. Together, these data identify WIA as a potential target for understanding
behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the emergence of opioid addiction.

Several features of WIA during acute dependence distinguish it from other behavioral
measures of addiction vulnerability. First WIA is unique in that it reliably predicts individual
differences in opioid SA in outbred rats, whereas numerous established behavioral markers of
individual differences in stimulant and alcohol SA (e.g., sensation-seeking as measured by
open-field locomotor activity, impulsivity) do not [35, 48, 49]. Indeed, open-field activity was not
correlated with any measure of MSA in this study, consistent with our previous findings using a
more limited set of MSA measures [35]. WIA also differs from other behavioral predictors of SA
of other drugs in that it predicted a variety of measures of drug SA rather than just a limited few
[e.g., 4, 5]. An additional unique feature of WIA is that it is an outcome of early opioid exposure,
as opposed to a preexisting disposition. Therefore, WIA may represent a neuroadaptive
mechanism underlying addiction vulnerability, as opposed to only a behavioral indicator. As
such, WIA promises to provide unique information on addiction vulnerability to complement
findings obtained using existing behavioral markers of addiction vulnerability.
In contrast to WIA, somatic signs during acute dependence did not predict any primary
MSA measure. These data complement previous findings indicating that affective/emotional and
somatic withdrawal signs are mediated by distinct neurobiological mechanisms [50, 51], and
supports the notion that the former have greater relevance to addiction vulnerability [52].
The current findings contrast with some studies reporting a positive relationship between
withdrawal sensitivity and addiction vulnerability [52-55]. Numerous methodological differences
between studies could account for this discrepancy (e.g., drug class studied, etc). In addition,
the current acute dependence model isolates the earliest stages of dependence, while prior
studies involved subjects in which dependence had already been established. As such,
withdrawal sensitivity may shift from being a protective factor to a vulnerability factor for
addiction as dependence develops [56]. The fact that WIA during late stage dependence was
associated with greater resistance to extinction (see Supplemental Materials) may be consistent
with this possibility. The lack of correlation between WIA during acute dependence and late-

stage dependence (Supplementary Material) also suggests that each of these stages may
provide unique information. Use of larger group sizes in order to provide adequate statistical
power is needed to further address this issue, which was not a primary goal of this study.
Comparison of MSA in the MOR + NX and control groups suggests that a prior history of
morphine exposure and/or withdrawal had limited effects on subsequent MSA. These data
contrast with findings that repeated, experimenter-administered acute drug injections (and
presumably spontaneous withdrawal episodes) enhance subsequent drug SA [33, 57, 58].
However, this phenomenon has been reported using stimulants rather than opioids and has
involved a larger number of experimenter-administered injections than were used here. These
or other methodological differences across studies (e.g., duration of interval between the final
acute injection and onset of SA) may account for the similar MSA across groups in this study.
Behavioral economics has been useful for understanding individual differences in
addiction vulnerability in both humans and animals, but has not been applied extensively to
MSA.

Consistent with our previous study [35], an exponential demand function generally

provided a good fit for morphine consumption under an FR escalation procedure. There were
also considerable individual differences in α (reinforcing efficacy) that were correlated with
severity of WIA during precipitated withdrawal, and a similar trend was observed for
spontaneous withdrawal.

Together, these data further support the utility and sensitivity of

behavioral economics to study individual differences in opioid addiction vulnerability.
In conclusion, this study establishes WIA as one of the first behavioral measures to
reliably predict individual differences in future opioid SA.

Future studies characterizing the

neurobiological mechanisms underlying WIA will allow for identification of addiction-related
effects (i.e., those uniquely related to severity of WIA) from other, corollary effects of opioids.
Hence, further use of this model in rats promises to provide fresh insights into neurobiological
mechanisms

underlying

vulnerability

and/or

resilience

to

opioid

addiction.

Higher anhedonia during withdrawal from initial opioid exposure is protective against
subsequent opioid self-administration in rats.

Supplementary Material
Animals
Male adult Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan/Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 276-300 g at
arrival were used. All rats were individually housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled
colony room with unlimited access to water under a reversed 12-h light/dark cycle (lights off at
10:00 hr). All behavioral testing occurred during the dark (active) phase. Beginning one week
following arrival, food was restricted to 18 g/day to facilitate operant performance, avoid
detrimental health effects of long-term ad libitum feeding, and limit catheter migration.

Apparatus
Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). Rats were tested in operant conditioning chambers
(29×26×33 cm; Med Associates, St. Albans, VT, USA) placed inside sound-attenuating cubicles.
A 5-cm-wide metal wheel manipulandum was fixed to the front wall. Brain stimulation was
administered with constant current stimulators (model #PHM-152, Med Associates). Rats were
connected to the stimulation circuit through bipolar leads (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, USA)
attached to gold-contact swivel commutators (Plastics One). MED-PC IV software was used to
control stimulation parameters and for data collection.

Morphine self-administration (MSA). MSA sessions were conducted using 16 standard
operant conditioning chambers (model ENV-007, Med Associates, Inc).

Each chamber

contained two response levers, a white stimulus (i.e., cue) light located 2 cm above each lever,
and a house light that provided ambient illumination. Each chamber was placed inside a soundattenuating cubicle equipped with an exhaust fan that provided masking noise. An infusion
pump (model PHM-100-15, Med Associates) placed outside each cubicle delivered infusions in
a volume of 0.1 ml/kg over approximately 1 second. MED-PC IV software (Med Associates)
was

used

for

operating

the

experimental

apparatus

and

recording

data.

Surgery
ICSS. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg/kg, i.m.) and dexmedetomidine
(0.5 mg, i.m.) and implanted with a bipolar stainless steel electrode (Plastics One) in the medial
forebrain bundle at the level of the lateral hypothalamus as described in [1]. Animals were
allowed to recover for at least 1 week prior to ICSS training. During the first 2 days of recovery,
all animals received injections of the antibiotic ceftriaxone (5.25 mg, i.m.) and the analgesic
buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.).
MSA. Each rat was implanted with a chronic indwelling catheter into the right jugular vein
under isoflurane (1-3%) anesthesia, using general surgical procedures described in detail
elsewhere [2, 3].

The catheter was externalized between the scapulae and attached to a

connection to a fluid swivel via a tether for morphine administration. Animals were allowed to
recover for one week after surgery, during which time they received daily i.v. infusions of
heparinized saline, ceftriaxone antibiotic (5.25 mg, first three days only), and s.c. injections of
buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg; first two days only) for analgesia. Infusions of methohexital (0.1 ml,
10 mg/ml, i.v.) were administered to check catheteer patency post-session on Fridays. If a

sec after methohexital infusion), another catheter was implanted into the ipsilateral femoral vein.
Failure of this second catheter resulted in removal of the animal from the study.

General testing procedures
ICSS. Each trial was initiated with presentation of a non-contingent stimulus (0.1-ms
cathodal square wave pulses at a frequency of 100 Hz for 500 ms) followed by a 7.5-s window,
during which a positive response on the wheel manipulandum produced a second contingent
stimulation identical to the first. Lack of responding during the 7.5-s window was considered a
negative response. Each positive or negative response was followed by a variable inter-trial
interval averaging 10 s (range, 7.5–12.5 s), during which time additional responses delayed the
onset of the subsequent trial by 12.5 s. Stimulus intensities were presented in four alternating
descending and ascending series (step size, 5 μA), with five trials presented at each current
intensity step. The current threshold for each series was defined as the midpoint between two
consecutive intensity steps that yielded three or more positive responses and two consecutive
intensity steps that yielded three or more negative responses. The overall ICSS threshold for
the session was defined as the mean of the current thresholds from the four alternating series.
To assess performance effects (e.g., motor disruption), response latencies (time between onset
of the non-contingent stimulus and a positive response) were averaged across all trials in which
a positive response was made.
MSA. During each 2 hr session, responding on the left (“active”) response lever resulted
in an i.v. infusion of morphine sulfate (0.2 mg/kg/inf) that was accompanied by offset of the
house light and the onset of a white cue light above the active response lever. Following a 30second timeout period, the cue light above the active lever was extinguished to signal
availability of the next infusion. Responses on the other response lever (the “inactive” lever)
were recorded but had no programmed consequences. This unit dose and access duration
support reliable MSA in the absence of self-mutilation associated with higher unit doses and

longer sessions [32]. On the first day of MSA (always a Friday), food powder was placed on the
active lever to facilitate contact with the lever. Data from this session were not included in the
data analysis.
Somatic withdrawal signs. Rats were placed in a clear plastic circular chamber and
recorded with a digital camera for 10 min. Recordings were later scored for somatic signs by a
blinded trained observer using a validated checklist [41]. Individual categories of withdrawal
signs included eye blinks, wet dog shake, escape jumps, abdominal constrictions, swallowing
movement, facial fasciculations, abnormal posture, ptosis, penile grooming, chromodacryorrhea,
salivation and diarrhea.

Supplementary Results
Acute dependence: Somatic withdrawal signs
One-way ANOVA on total somatic signs during the 5th session of naloxone-precipitated
withdrawal indicated a significant effect of group (F (3, 52) = 11.51, p < 0.0001). Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test revealed significantly higher scores in the the MOR + NX group
compared to the SAL + SAL group (q(52) =2.62, adjusted p = 0.03). In contrast, neither the
MOR + SAL or SAL + NX group differed significantly from the SAL + SAL group (Figure S1A).
During spontaneous withdrawal, somatic sign scores did not differ between the two
groups receiving MOR (MOR + NX and MOR + SAL groups) or between the two groups
receiving SAL (SAL + SAL and SAL + NX groups). Data from these groups were therefore
combined into single MOR (n = 37) and SAL (n = 20) conditions. T-tests showed that scores
were significantly higher in the MOR condition compared to the SAL condition (Welch-corrected
t(51.31) = 2.25, p = 0.03) (Figure S1B).

Correlations in the MOR + NX group

Figures S2 and S3 show scatterplots portraying the relationship between composite
precipitated WIA (Figure S2) and peak spontaneous WIA (Figure S3) during acute dependence
testing and various MSA measures.

Comparison of MSA in the MOR + NX and control groups
Rats in the MOR + NX group and control groups (MOR + SAL, SAL + NX, SAL + SAL)
did not differ on most measures of MSA. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA on infusion rates
between the MOR + NX and the control groups during the first 10 days of acquisition indicated a
significant overall effect of session (F (9, 468) = 2.20, p = 0.02) but no effect of group or
interaction between group and session (Figure S4A). Two-way ANOVA on group and FR during
demand testing showed a significant main effect of FR (F (6, 246) = 152, p < 0.001) and
interaction between group and FR (F (18, 246) = 2.144, p = 0.005). but no main effect of group
(Figure S4B). The MOR + NX had significantly lower infusions at FR 2 and FR 3 compared to
the SAL + SAL group (all p < 0.01). However, a one-way ANOVA comparing elasticity of
demand (α) (i.e., the primary outcome) indicated no significant difference between groups
(Figure S4C). The MOR + NX and control groups also did not significantly differ in three
secondary behavioral economic measures: intensity of demand (Q0), maximal response output
(Omax) and the unit price at which maximal response output occurred (Pmax) (Table S2).
Additionally, the groups did not differ in infusions during extinction, as a two-way repeated
measures ANOVA revealed a significant overall effect of session (F (10, 410) = 79.53, p <
0.0001) (Figure S4D) but no effect of group or group x session interaction. Finally, two-way
ANOVAs showed a main effect of reinstatement condition on reinstatement scores during
morphine- and cue-induced reinstatement (F (1.291, 51.65) = 28.95, P < 0.0001) and
yohimbine- and cue-induced reinstatement (F (1.747, 65.79) = 22.68, P < 0.0001), with
responses significantly elevated during all drug (morphine or yohimbine) and/or cue conditions

compared to the VEH + CUE control condition (Figure S4E-F).

However, there was no

significant main effect of group or interaction during either morphine- and cue-induced
reinstatement testing or yohimbine- and cue-reinstatement testing.

Late-stage dependence
Precipitated withdrawal: ICSS. Baseline ICSS thresholds and response latencies for
late-stage precipitated withdrawal did not differ between groups (Table S3). Two-way ANOVA
on ICSS thresholds during precipitated withdrawal revealed a significant main effect of group (F
(3, 22) = 6.2, p = 0.003), but no significant effect of session or interaction. Holm-Sidak’s multiple
comparison showed significantly higher ICSS thresholds in the MOR + NX group compared to
the SAL + SAL control group during all sessions (all t(22) ≥ 3.71, all p < 0.05) (Figure S5A).
There was no significant effect of group, session, or group x session interaction on ICSS
latencies during precipitated withdrawal (data not shown).
Spontaneous withdrawal: ICSS. Baseline ICSS thresholds and response latencies did
not differ between groups (Table S3). ICSS thresholds during hours 2 (agonist effect) and hours
6 – 98 (withdrawal period) of spontaneous withdrawal did not differ between the two groups
receiving MOR (MOR + NX versus MOR + SAL groups) or SAL (SAL + SAL versus SAL + NX
groups). Data from these groups were therefore combined into a single MOR (n = 15) and SAL
(n = 5) group. Welch’s corrected t test showed no significant difference in ICSS thresholds
between MOR (118.4 ± 14.03%) and SAL (102.6 ± 2.58%) groups during the 2-hour session.
Two-way ANOVA on ICSS thresholds during spontaneous withdrawal 6-98 hours after morphine
injection revealed no significant main effect of time, group (morphine vs. saline) or interaction
(Figure S5B). However, comparison of peak ICSS threshold values between 6 hours and 98
hours (regardless of the time point at which they occurred) differed significantly between the
morphine (121.7 ± 4.78%) and saline (106.8 ± 2.04%) groups (Welch-corrected t(17.54) = 2.85,

p = 0.01). No significant difference in ICSS response latencies was observed between groups 2
hours after injection (agonist effect) or 6-98 hours after injection (withdrawal effect) (data not
shown).

Precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal: Somatic signs. One-way ANOVA revealed a
significant overall difference in somatic signs scores between groups during the 5th session of
precipitated withdrawal during late stage dependence (F(3, 23) = 4.57, p = 0.01). However,
Dunnett’s multiple comparison indicated that none of the groups differed significantly from the
SAL + SAL group (Figure S5C).
During spontaneous withdrawal, somatic signs did not differ between the two groups
receiving MOR or between the two groups receiving SAL. Data from these groups were
therefore combined into single MOR (n = 15) and SAL (n = 5) conditions, respectively. Total
somatic signs in the MOR condition were significantly higher than in the SAL condition (Welchcorrected t(21.44) = 2.19, p = 0.04) (Figure S5D).

Correlations during late-stage dependence
In MOR + NX rats, ICSS thresholds or somatic signs scores during late-stage
dependence during precipitated or spontaneous withdrawal did not correlate with any MSA
measure, except for a significant correlation between higher composite z-score for ICSS
thresholds during precipitated withdrawal and higher infusions during extinction (i.e., greater
resistance to extinction; r = 0.61, p = 0.04).
Comparison of withdrawal severity during acute dependence and late-stage dependence
in rats that completed both phases suggested that these measures were largely independent.
Thus, ICSS thresholds during precipitated or spontaneous withdrawal during late-stage
dependence did not correlate with these same ICSS measures during acute dependence (all r: -

0.16 ≤ r ≤ -0.04, all p ≥ 0.57).

Somatic signs during spontaneous withdrawal correlated

significantly between late-stage dependence and acute dependence (r = 0.73, p = 0.007), but
this correlation was not observed during precipitated withdrawal (r = 0.13, p = 0.45).
