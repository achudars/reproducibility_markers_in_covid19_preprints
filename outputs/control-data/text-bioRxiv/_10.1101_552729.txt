Summary

54
55

As organisms age, they often accumulate protein aggregates that are thought to be

56

toxic, potentially leading to age-related diseases. This accumulation of protein

57

aggregates is partially attributed to a failure to maintain protein homeostasis. A variety of

58

genetic factors have been linked to longevity, but how these factors also contribute to

59

protein homeostasis is not completely understood. In order to understand the

60

relationship between aging and protein aggregation, we tested how a gene that

61

regulates lifespan and age-dependent locomotor behaviors, p38 MAPK (p38Kb),

62

influences protein homeostasis as an organism ages. We find that p38Kb regulates age-

63

dependent protein aggregation through an interaction with the Chaperone-Assisted

64

Selective Autophagy complex. Furthermore, we have identified Lamin as an age-

65

dependent target of p38Kb and the Chaperone-Assisted Selective Autophagy complex.

Introduction

68
69

Protein turnover is critical for maintaining tissue health as many proteins become

70

damaged or misfolded during normal tissue functions. Therefore, the cell utilizes a

71

variety of protein quality control mechanisms to refold or degrade these damaged

72

proteins, including the ubiquitin proteasome system and macroautophagy. During aging,

73

protein quality control mechanisms become less efficient leading to the accumulation of

74

damaged or misfolded proteins that begin to form protein aggregates1. It has been

75

hypothesized that these aggregates are toxic and may lead to the deleterious

76

phenotypes associated with normal aging, such as impaired tissue function1.

77

Furthermore, decreased protein aggregation has been associated with longevity. For

78

example, over-expression of Foxo leads to an increased lifespan but also a concordant

79

decrease in protein aggregation in C. elegans, Drosophila, and mice 2–6, suggesting that

80

lifespan and protein aggregation are tightly linked processes. However, the molecular

81

mechanisms that underlie the relationship between aging and protein homeostasis have

82

not been fully characterized.

83
84

One pathway that has been linked to both aging and protein homeostasis is the

85

stress response p38 MAPK (p38K) pathway. In mammals, there are four p38K genes (α,

86

β, γ, and δ), and p38Kα has been linked to both the inhibition 7,8 and induction 9,10 of

87

macroautophagy, in particular in response to oxidative stress 11,12. In addition, p38Kα

88

has been linked to regulating macroautophagy in cellular senescence 13–15. However,

89

how p38K signaling may contribute to protein homeostasis in response to natural aging

90

is not well understood. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has two canonical p38K

91

genes (p38Ka and p38Kb), and we have previously reported that p38Kb acts in the adult

92

musculature to regulate aging. We found that over-expression of p38Kb leads to

93

increased lifespan while loss of p38Kb results in a short lifespan and age-dependent

94

locomotor behavior defects 16. In addition, oxidatively damaged proteins accumulate in

95

the muscle of p38Kb mutants with age 16, and loss of p38Kb leads to increased

96

polyubiquitination of insoluble proteins and alterations in oxidative stress dependent

97

translation 17, suggesting that these oxidatively damaged proteins may be aggregating in

98

p38Kb mutants. Furthermore, p38Kb has been shown in a Drosophila cell culture system

99

to pull down with the HspB8 homologue CG14207 18, which plays a role in the muscle by

100

regulating protein homeostasis as a part of a protein quality control mechanism called

101

BAG-3 Mediated Selective Autophagy pathway or the Chaperone-Assisted Selective

102

Autophagy (CASA) complex in flies 19,20. The CASA complex also includes the

103

chaperone Hsc70 and the co-chaperone BAG-3 (starvin in flies). BAG-3/starvin binds to

104

specific damaged or misfolded protein substrates and brings them to the CASA complex

105

where it binds to Hsc70 and HspB8. Those substrates that cannot be refolded by the

106

complex are polyubiquitinated and targeted to the autophagosome through a handover

107

between BAG-3/stv and the autophagy adaptor protein p62 (ref(2)p in flies), and

108

subsequently degraded through the autophagosome-lysosome system 21–25.

109
110

Here, we report that p38Kb regulates age-dependent muscle protein

111

homeostasis through an interaction with the CASA complex. We find that p38Kb acts as

112

an intermediary between BAG-3/starvin and p62/ref(2)p in targeting damaged or

113

misfolded proteins for degradation. This interaction is not only important for maintaining

114

protein homeostasis but also for lifespan extension. In addition, we find that the

115

Drosophila homologue of the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria protein, Lamin A/C, is a target

116

for p38Kb and CASA complex mediated protein turnover, suggesting that the p38Kb

117

aging phenotypes may be a result of impaired Lamin degradation.

Indirect flight muscles were prepared as described above from 9 individual flies per

158

genotype. Protein aggregates were identified using mouse anti-polyubiquitin 1:1000

159

(Enzo Life Sciences). Three muscles from each individual fly were imaged as z-series

160

and flattened into a single image as a max projection using confocal microscopy for a

161

total of 27 muscles per genotype. Images were analyzed using Image J “Analyze

p38Kb regulates age-dependent protein homeostasis.

231

p38Kb null mutant animals (p38KbΔ45/Δ45, a deletion of the p38Kb gene) exhibit age-

232

dependent locomotor behavior defects and have a 48% lifespan reduction. In addition,

233

biochemical analysis suggests that p38Kb null mutants have increased levels of

234

insoluble polyubiquitinated proteins in the thoracic musculature of aged animals as

235

observed by immunoblot analysis 17. However, protein aggregate size and distribution

236

have not been visualized in the p38Kb mutants, nor is it known whether augmenting

237

p38Kb activity in muscles leads to a change in protein homeostasis. Therefore, we

238

analyzed how p38Kb expression influences protein aggregation. We find that p38Kb null

239

mutants have an increased number of protein aggregates in the adult indirect flight

240

muscle at 1 week and 3 weeks of age (Figure 1A-B and E-F, Table S1) and increased

241

aggregate size with age (Figure 1G-H, Table S1) as compared to a genetic background

242

control (p38KbEx41/Ex41, a precise excision allele). Furthermore, transgenic inhibition of

243

p38Kb in the muscle using a dominant negative kinase dead construct (p38KbKD, 16) also

244

results in a significant increase in aggregate number, however aggregate size was not

245

affected (Figure 1I-L and Table S2). Conversely, as both strong and moderate levels of

246

p38Kb over-expression lead to an increased lifespan (37% and 14% extension,

247

respectively) 16, we tested if p38Kb over-expression also affects protein aggregation. We

248

find that both strong over-expression of p38Kb in the adult muscle using the Mef2-GAL4

249

driver (Figure 1C-D and M-P, Table S3) and moderate over-expression of p38Kb using

250

the MHC-GAL4 driver (Figure 1Q-T and Table S4) leads to decreased protein aggregate

251

number and size throughout the lifespan. It has been hypothesized that protein

252

aggregate accumulation and increased size may be toxic, potentially explaining the

253

decreased lifespan and age-dependent locomotor abnormalities in p38KbΔ45 null mutants

254

and the increased longevity in the p38Kb over-expression animals.

255
256

p38Kb mediates age-dependent phenotypes through autophagy

257

In order to determine what mechanism plays a role in the clearance of polyubiquitinated

258

protein aggregates, we first tested what type of ubiquitin linkage is present in the

259

aggregates in wild type flies. In particular, K63-linked ubiquitination has been shown to

260

facilitate the formation of aggregates 28–30 that are cleared through autophagy 30–32. We

261

find that a subset of aggregates from aging flies contain K63-linked ubiquitinated

262

proteins (Figure 2A-C), suggesting that these muscle protein aggregates are degraded

263

through autophagy. Polyubiquitinated protein aggregates can be degraded through

264

selective autophagy in which the adaptor protein p62 (ref(2)p in flies) promotes the

265

packaging and delivery of polyubiquitinated proteins to the autophagosome 33. If p38Kb

266

requires selective autophagy to mediate protein homeostasis, then loss of ref(2)p will

267

block the p38Kb mediated decreased aggregation phenotype. We find that loss of a

268

single copy of ref(2)p results in fewer aggregates (Figure 2D-E and Table S5), which

269

may reflect compensation by other protein clearance mechanisms with aging, especially

270

as homozygous ref(2)p mutants are viable. When a single copy of ref(2)p is removed in

271

the p38Kb over-expression background, this prevents the reduced protein aggregation

272

observed in the p38Kb over-expression animals at both young and old ages (Figure 2D-

273

E and Table S5). This dominant interaction suggests that ref(2)p acts downstream of

274

p38Kb to promote the degradation of protein aggregates.

275
276

p38Kb colocalizes with the CASA complex in the adult flight muscle.

277

In order to better understand the role of p38Kb in protein homeostasis, we first

278

determined where in the muscle p38Kb localizes and find that a FLAG-tagged p38Kb

279

(green) colocalizes with the Z-disc marker alpha-actinin and is also present at the M-line

280

(Figure 2F). The muscle Z-disc is an area of high protein turnover, and one protein

281

quality control mechanism that localizes to the Z-disc in mice and adult flies is the

282

Chaperone-Assisted Selective Autophagy (CASA) complex 19,34. In adult Drosophila

283

muscle, the CASA complex has been reported to consist of the Hsc70 homologue,

284

Hsc70-4, the HspB8 homologue CG14207 and the BAG-3 homologue starvin (stv) 19.

We find that p38Kb colocalizes with all the CASA complex members at the Z-disc and

288

p38Kb physically interacts with the CASA complex in the adult flight muscle.

289

In order to further determine if p38Kb physically interacts with the CASA complex in the

290

adult muscle, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In Drosophila cell

291

culture p38Kbwt was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the HspB8 homologue

292

CG1420718, therefore, we tested if this interaction also occurs in adult indirect flight

293

muscle. As the interaction between p38Kb and its targets may be transient, we utilized a

294

FLAG-tagged p38Kb kinase dead construct (UAS-p38KbKD Mef2-GAL4) that is able to

295

be activated and bind to a target but cannot phosphorylate it, leading to a delayed

296

release of the target35. We expressed p38KbKD in the adult flight muscle of a fly that also

297

endogenously expressed GFP tagged HspB8, in which GFP is spliced in as a new exon

298

of the endogenous gene. This results in a GFP fusion protein that is expressed in the

299

same pattern as endogenous HspB8 (19 and Figure 2H’). We find that p38KbKD was able

300

to pull down HspB8 (Figure 2J) as compared to the HspB8-GFP control background. In

301

addition, expression of p38KbKD in a wildtype background was able to pull down un-

302

tagged endogenous stv (Figure 2K). We then performed reverse IPs in which we

303

immunoprecipitated each endogenously GFP tagged CASA complex protein (Hsc70-4,

304

HspB8, or stv) and probed for FLAG tagged p38KbKD and found that p38Kb co-

305

immunoprecipitates with the CASA complex (Figure 2L-N) with stronger binding at

306

younger ages than older ages. Interestingly, we found no significant difference in the

307

expression levels of Hsc70-GFP, stv-GFP, and over-expression of p38KbKD with age

308

(Figure S1A-B, D) while levels of HspB8-GFP increased with age (Figure S1C). These

309

data suggest that the age-dependent interaction between p38Kb and the CASA complex

310

may be due to changes in the physical interactions between these proteins rather than a

311

reduction in protein levels.

312

To verify that endogenous p38Kb can interact with the CASA complex, we

313

performed co-immunoprecipitations with muscle lysates from flies expressing either

314

endogenously GFP tagged Hsc70-4, HspB8 or stv in a wild type background and probed

315

for endogenous activated p38K that is dual phosphorylated on the TGY motif. We find

316

that all three members of the CASA can co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous

317

phosphorylated p38K in the muscle (Figure 2O). These results suggest that p38Kb is

318

able to physically interact with the CASA complex.

319
320

p38Kb acts downstream of the CASA complex.

321

As p38Kb physically interacts with the CASA complex, we next tested if p38Kb is

322

acting upstream activity of the complex to promote the initial recognition of misfolded

323

proteins or the downstream activity of the complex to direct un-foldable proteins to the

324

autophagosome. As BAG-3/stv provides both the specificity to the CASA complex and is

325

involved in the handoff of damaged proteins to p62/ref(2)p for autosomal degradation 21–

326

25

327

impaired locomotor functions, muscle degeneration and early lethality 19,36. Due to the

328

severity of these null phenotypes, we utilized stv RNAi lines to generate an allelic series

329

of stv loss of function in the muscle. We find that weak inhibition of stv (UAS-stv

330

RNAi34408 MHC-GAL4) had no effect on protein aggregation (Table S6). However,

331

moderate inhibition of stv (UAS-stv RNAi34409 MHC-GAL4) results in increased protein

332

aggregate number and size (Figure 3A-B and Table S7) and results in a decrease in

333

lifespan particularly in the first half of life as compared to outcrossed controls (Figure 3C

334

and Table S8). Strong inhibition of stv (UAS-stv RNAi34408 Mef2-GAL4) leads to a

335

severely reduced lifespan of ~4 days on average (Figure 3D and Table S9).

336

If p38Kb acts to regulate the downstream activity of the CASA complex, then over-

337

expression of p38Kb should rescue these stv RNAi phenotypes. We find that over-

338

expression of p38Kb rescues both protein aggregate number and size in the stv

339

moderate inhibition background (Figure 3A-B and Table S7) and also rescues the

340

lifespan defect (Figure 3C and Table S9). Furthermore, p38Kb over-expression is able to

341

partially rescue the decreased lifespan exhibited by strong stv inhibition increasing

342

average lifespan from 4 days to 13 days (Figure 3D and Table S10). To further test if

343

p38Kb acts downstream of the CASA complex, we combined loss of p38Kb with CASA

344

complex over-expression. If p38Kb acts downstream of the CASA complex, then over-

345

expression of the CASA complex members in the p38Kb mutant background will not be

346

able to rescue the p38Kb mutant phenotypes. We find that over-expression of stv in the

347

p38Kb mutants not only fails to rescue the p38Kb mediated short lifespan defect but

348

reduces the lifespan further (Figure 3E and Table S11). This is particularly striking as

349

over-expression of stv in a wild type background does not significantly affect lifespan

350

(Figure 4H and Table S12) as compared to the outcrossed transgene control (p value =

351

0.195). This suggests that p38Kb may be a limiting factor in regulating the downstream

352

activity of the CASA complex in which it hands the poly-ubiquitinated misfolded proteins

353

to ref(2)p for degradation through the autophagosome.

354
355
356

p38Kb regulates the activity of the CASA complex in protein homeostasis.
If p38Kb is a limiting factor for stv function, then the combined over-expression of

357

p38Kb and stv may result in a further beneficial effect. We find that over-expression of

358

stv alone results in fewer aggregates at young and old ages (Figure 4A-B and Table

359

S13) and smaller aggregates with age (Figure 4D and Table S13) as compared to

360

outcrossed controls. However, co-over-expression of p38Kb and stv does not result in a

361

further reduction in aggregate number as compared to over-expression of p38Kb or stv

362

alone (Figure 4A and Table S13). By 5 weeks of age, co-over-expression of p38Kb and

363

stv flies have comparable aggregate number to controls (Figure 4B and Table S13).

364

Conversely, p38Kb and stv co-over-expression results in a reduction in aggregate size at

365

a young age compared to over-expression of stv alone (Figure 4C and Table S13, p

366

value < 0.001), suggesting that p38Kb is a limiting factor for stv function in regulating

367

aggregate size. Unlike with aggregate number, the aggregates remain significantly

368

smaller in size as the flies age in the combined over-expression background (Figure 4D

369

and Table S13). We also find that co-over-expression of p38Kb and stv leads to an

370

additional 5% increase in lifespan relative to p38Kb over-expression alone (Figure 4H

371

and Table S12). Interestingly, the co-over-expression animals show a very similar

372

lifespan to the p38Kb over-expression alone animals until ~day 50, when the p38Kb

373

alone animals begin to die at a faster rate (Figure 4H). One explanation is that co-over-

374

expression of p38Kb and stv provides beneficial effects in early adulthood that continue

375

throughout adulthood leading to increased lifespan despite the presence of protein

376

aggregates. Another possibility is that aggregate size is a reflection of aggregate

377

content. If the CASA complex can only target a subset of proteins for refolding or

378

degradation, then increasing CASA complex activity could lead to smaller aggregates as

379

the CASA targets are effectively degraded through an interaction with p38Kb and ref(2)p

380

rather than aggregating. Therefore, size and/or content may play a more important role

381

in determining lifespan as compared to overall aggregate number.

382
383
384

p38Kb is required for proper localization of stv in the muscle.
Since we find that p38Kb acts between stv and ref(2)p in regulating protein

385

aggregation, we hypothesize that p38Kb plays a role in stabilizing the transfer of

386

misfolded proteins primed for degradation from the CASA complex to ref(2)p. If so, then

387

over-expression of p38Kb would lead to increased efficiency in targeting misfolded

388

proteins to the autophagosome (Figure 1M-T), and inhibition of p38Kb would lead to an

389

increase in protein aggregation (Figure 1E-L). In addition, loss of p38Kb may lead to a

390

failure of stv to maintain its interaction with the CASA complex or to interact with ref(2)p.

391

Therefore, we tested if stv is still able to localize to the Z-disc in the absence of p38Kb.

392

We find that in p38Kb null mutants, stv is more diffuse throughout the muscle but is still

393

able to localize to the Z-disc and M-line in (Figure 4E-G), suggesting that its localization

394

is partially impaired in the absence of p38Kb. Furthermore, we find that the localization

395

of the CASA complex member HspB8 in the muscle is unaffected by loss of p38Kb

396

(Figure S2). These data indicate that p38Kb may play a role in stabilizing the interaction

397

between the CASA complex and stv that allows stv to direct misfolded proteins to

398

ref(2)p.

399
400

Lamin protein binds to the CASA complex and accumulates in stv RNAi and

401

p38Kb mutants.

402

In order to determine if p38Kb might be playing a role in the targeting of

403

misfolded proteins from stv to ref(2)p, we first needed to identify a protein target of both

404

stv and p38Kb. Therefore, we focused on proteins associated with Limb-Griddle

405

Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD), which is caused by mutations in either BAG-3 (stv) or

406

HspB8 37–39. In addition, p38K signaling has been implicated in LGMD 40–42. Drosophila

407

have 19 orthologues of LGMD proteins, one of which is Lamin A/C (Lamin or Lamin Dm0

408

in flies). Lamin is of particular interest since mutations in Lamin A/C also result in the

409

accelerated aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria 43–45, and Lamin has been shown

410

to aggregate under oxidative stress conditions 46. Mutations in Lamin A/C are also

411

sufficient to induce Lamin aggregation and abnormal nuclear morphology in human cell

412

culture, C. elegans, and Drosophila systems 44,47–54. Furthermore in Drosophila, Lamin

413

knockouts have similar phenotypes to p38Kb and/or stv mutants, such as reduced

414

locomotor function and increased activity of the Nrf-2/Keap-1 pathway 49,55,56.

415

If Lamin is a target of the CASA complex, then decreased activity of the CASA

416

complex should result in an accumulation of Lamin protein. We find that Lamin levels do

417

not change with age (Figure 5A), however, inhibition of stv results in a significant

418

increase in the total amount of Lamin protein regardless of age (Figure 5A-B, p value

419

0.028). Interestingly, loss of p38Kb leads to an age-dependent increase in Lamin protein

420

as compared to age matched controls (Figure 5C-D, p value = 0.006643). As the

421

association between p38Kb and the CASA seems to decline with age (Figure 2L-N),

422

these data suggest that p38Kb activity later in life is important for maintaining protein

423

homeostasis and lifespan.

424

To investigate if Lamin is accumulating in the protein aggregates, we performed

425

fractionation experiments in which we find that Lamin is predominantly found in fractions

426

5-7 in controls with the majority concentrated in faction 6 (Figure 5E). Interestingly, we

427

also find a high molecular weight from of Lamin mainly restricted to fraction 5 (Figure

428

5E). In addition, we also observe that both the main and high molecular weight Lamin

429

species are in the aggregate containing pellet (Figure 5E). We next tested how loss of

430

p38Kb affects the aggregation of Lamin and find that p38Kb mutants have decreased

431

Lamin in fractions 5-7 with a concurrent increase of both the main and high molecular

432

weight species of Lamin in the pellet (Figure 5E). This suggests that Lamin is a target of

433

p38Kb and that loss of p38Kb results in increased aggregation of Lamin.

434
435

Of interest is this high molecular weight form of Lamin, which is present in

436

fraction 5 and the aggregates (Figure 5E). One important protein domain in Lamin is the

437

CaaX box, which is farnesylated and required for Lamin localization to the inner nuclear

438

membrane57–60. To test if this might be a farnesylated form of Lamin, we utilized the

439

LamA25 mutant which has a frameshift that results in the loss of the C-terminal CaaX

440

box61. We find that the high molecular weight form of Lamin is lost in the LamA25 mutant

441

whereas the predominant 75kDa band of Lamin is still present (Figure 5F). These data

442

suggest that the high molecular weight Lamin we observe is the farnesylated form.

443
444

In addition to farnesylation, Lamin can also be phosphorylated by a variety of

445

kinases that can change the solubility of Lamin 54,62. For example, in a Drosophila cell

446

culture system, a phospho-mimic mutation at Ser45 (the equivalent of Ser22 in humans)

447

results in Lamin aggregation in both the nucleus and cytoplasm 54. This serine residue is

448

phosphorylated by the cd2 kinase 63, but also happens to be a potential p38K

449

phosphorylation site. Therefore, we tested if the levels of phospho- Ser45 Lamin are

450

altered in p38Kb mutants. We find that phospho-Lamin levels are not significantly altered

451

in the p38Kb mutants (Figure 5G-H p=0.09), suggesting that p38Kb is not required for

452

Ser45 phosphorylation. We next examined if phosphorylated Lamin is also present in the

453

aggregates. We find that in controls, phosphorylated Lamin is present in factions 5-7

454

with low amounts in the pellet (Figure 5I). We also observe a low molecular weight

455

phospho-Lamin form that appears in the pellet (Figure 5I). In the p38Kb mutants,

456

phospho-Lamin expression is reduced in fractions 6 and 7 and accumulates in the pellet

457

(Figure 5I). Furthermore, increasingly smaller low molecular weight species of phospho-

458

Lamin are present in the p38KbΔ45 mutants including the pellet (Figure 5I), suggesting

459

that loss of p38Kb prevents the effective clearance of these Lamin cleavage forms.

460

Interestingly, loss of the Lamin CaaX box does not affect these lower molecular weight

461

forms, however, it does result in an increase in the phosphorylation of full-length Lamin

462

(Figure 5F). Additionally, we do not detect phosphorylation positive high molecular

463

weight forms of Lamin (Figure 5F), suggesting that farnesylated lamin is not

464

phosphorylated at Ser45. These data combined with our finding that full length Lamin is

465

phosphorylated, suggest that when Lamin is unphosphorylated it is prone to

466

farnesylation that may lead to aggregation.

467
468

To determine if Lamin is a direct target of p38Kb and the CASA complex, we

469

tested if Lamin can bind to the CASA complex. We immunoprecipitated endogenously

470

GFP tagged HspB8, Hsc70-4 and stv from adult Drosophila muscle and probed for

471

endogenous Lamin. We find that full-length Lamin co-immunoprecipitates with all three

472

members of the CASA complex (Figure 6A), but do not detect binding with either the

473

higher or lower molecular weight forms of Lamin found in the fractions (Figure 5E and I).

474

Furthermore, we expressed either a nuclear localization signal tagged GFP or Lamin

475

tagged with GFP in the muscle and found that endogenous stv co-immunoprecipitates

476

with Lamin (Figure 6B). These data suggest that the CASA complex is able to bind to

477

misfolded forms of full-length Lamin for targeting to the autophagosome.

478
479

As we hypothesize that p38Kb is interacting with the CASA complex at the point

480

in which the misfolded targets are handed over to ref(2)p for degradation, we tested if

481

p38Kb also binds to Lamin. We find that p38KbKD expressed in the muscle co-

482

immunoprecipitates with both high and low molecular weight forms of Lamin (Figure 6C).

483

Interestingly, p38Kb physically interacts with the aggregate prone low molecular weight

484

species of Lamin as opposed to the predominant full-length form of Lamin (Figure 6C).

485

More striking is that p38KbKD physically interacts with increasingly larger forms of Lamin

486

(Figure 6C), suggesting that p38Kb is interacting with the poly-ubiquitinated forms of

487

Lamin.

488
489

We have developed a model in which misfolded proteins are targeted by stv to

490

the CASA complex. Those proteins that cannot be refolded are then tagged with poly19

491

ubiquitin. These poly-ubiquitinated proteins are handed off to ref(2)p in a process

492

mediated by p38Kb. This model predicts that in p38Kb mutants these poly-ubiquitinated

493

proteins accumulate and then form aggregates. It additionally predicts that over-

494

expression of p38Kb would lead to increased efficiency of the poly-ubiquitinated proteins

495

being targeted to the autophagosome. This model would also predict that misfolded full-

496

length Lamin would bind to the CASA complex for refolding. If Lamin cannot be refolded

497

it is then poly-ubiquitinated and transferred to ref(2)p through an interaction with p38Kb.

498
499

Discussion

500

We find that the aging gene p38Kb regulates age-dependent protein homeostasis

501

through an interaction with the CASA complex and is acting at a step between the poly-

502

ubiquitination of a un-foldable target and its transfer to ref(2)p for autolysosomal

503

mediated degradation. Interestingly, we find that p38Kb is important for the proper

504

localization of stv to the Z-disc but does not affect the localization of other complex

505

members. This suggests that p38Kb may play a role in maintaining the interaction

506

between stv and the CASA complex which may be necessary for target transfer to

507

ref(2)p. stv has a conserved MAPK docking site as well several potential conserved

508

p38K phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, mammalian p62 has been shown to bind to

509

p38Kb in vitro through two domains 64, which are partially conserved in flies. Therefore,

510

one possibility is that p38Kb mediated phosphorylation of stv facilitates the localization of

511

a functional CASA complex to the Z-disc, where damaged proteins are rapidly turned

512

over. Another possibility is that p38Kb binds to stv and ref(2)p and that the

513

phosphorylation of stv is required for target hand-over to ref(2)p so that in the absence of

514

p38Kb, stv cannot transfer targets to ref(2)p. A consequence of this may be that stv and

515

the protein target together are released from the CASA complex, leading to

516

mislocalization of stv. As we don’t detect a decrease in phospho-Lamin in the p38Kb

directly phosphorylating the target proteins as a part of the stv-ref(2)p hand-over

519

process.

520
521

How protein aggregation contributes to aging and disease has been an area of

522

great interest. One outstanding question is if protein aggregation is a consequence or

523

cause of aging. It has been hypothesized that protein aggregates accumulate with age

524

as the amount of damaged or misfolded proteins increase. However, it is not clear

525

whether or not these aggregating proteins are toxic leading to tissue dysfunction and a

526

disease state. Previous studies have found that long-lived fly strains such as over-

527

expression of Foxo or parkin result in reduced protein aggregate formation 4,65.

528

Therefore, we hypothesized that decreased protein aggregation would lead to improved

529

measures of healthspan, while increased protein aggregation would lead to reduced

530

measures of healthspan. As expected, we find that the short-lived p38Kb mutants, which

531

exhibit premature locomotor behavior defects 16, have large and numerous protein

532

aggregates. Similarly, inhibition of stv results in increased aggregation and decreased

533

lifespan. We also find that over-expression of p38Kb leads to decreased protein

534

aggregation and increased lifespan. However, over-expression of stv leads to decreased

535

aggregate number but does not extend lifespan. One possibility is that decreasing

536

aggregation alone is not sufficient to promote lifespan extension. Another possibility is

537

that aggregate number is not as critical as aggregate size and/or content, particularly

538

early in life, for lifespan extension. We find that stv over-expression only results in

539

decreased aggregate size in older animals, however, co-over-expression of p38Kb and

540

stv leads to reduced aggregate size at a young and old ages and leads to a further

541

increase in lifespan. Thus, the turnover of specific toxic protein or subset of proteins

542

early in life may lead to a reduction in the exposure to these toxic species and a lifespan

extension. We find that Lamin, which is mutated to an aggregation prone protein form in

544

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria 44,53,62,66, is a target of p38Kb and the CASA complex.

545

Interestingly, p38Kb and Lamin mutants share similar phenotypes such as age-

546

dependent locomotor impairments 16,55,56 and upregulation of the Nrf-2/Keap-1 pathway

547

16,49

548

toxic to the cell, leading to impaired locomotor function, increased stress and decreased

549

lifespan. Thus, we have found that one aging gene (p38Kb) regulates a second,

550

unrelated aging gene (Lamin) via the CASA complex. These data suggest a new link

551

between aging pathways and how they may converge through the regulation of protein

552

homeostasis.
