ABSTRACT
The double strand break (DSB) is a highly toxic form of DNA damage that is
thought to be both a driver and consequence of age-related dysfunction.
Although DSB repair is essential for a cell’s survival, little is known about
how DSB repair mechanisms are affected by cellular age. Here we
characterize the impact of cellular aging on the efficiency of single-strand
annealing (SSA), a repair mechanism for DSBs occurring between direct
repeats. Using a single-cell reporter of SSA repair, we measure SSA repair
efficiency in young and old cells, and report a 23.4% decline in repair
efficiency. This decline is not due to increased usage of non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ). Instead, we identify increased G1-phase duration in old cells
as a factor responsible for the decreased SSA repair efficiency. We further
explore how SSA repair efficiency is affected by sequence heterology and find
that heteroduplex rejection remains high in old cells. Our work provides
novel quantitative insights into the links between cellular aging and DSB
repair efficiency at single-cell resolution in replicatively aging cells.

INTRODUCTION
DNA damage has long been hypothesized to be both a driver and consequence of
aging1, 2. Old tissues and cells accumulate DNA damage and mutations3, 4, 5. Such
mutations can negatively impact tissue homeostasis and organismal function, and
may even increase the risk of cancer6, 7, 8. The DNA double strand break (DSB)
represents a major category of DNA damage. Inability to repair a DSB can lead to
cell death or genomic instability9. Even when a DSB is repaired, there are
mutagenic repair mechanisms that can both increase genetic variability and impact
cellular fitness10. Whether cellular aging impairs DSB repair efficiency in single
cells remains unknown.
A useful model system to understand how cellular aging affects DSB repair
efficiency is that of replicative aging of the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae11. Replicative lifespan is the number of times a yeast mother cell produces
daughters11. This number varies across genetic backgrounds and growth conditions,
and is connected to several metabolic pathways12, 13. The connection between DSB
repair and replicative lifespan is important for several reasons. To avoid
chromosomal instability, most cells that cannot repair a DSB will halt division, and
thus have a limited replicative lifespan14. In the other direction, continued cell
division after mutagenic DSB repair results in propagation of these mutations to
future generations with potentially negative consequences on cell fitness.

Multiple mechanisms exist to repair double strand breaks and their efficiency
and ability to function properly could change with replicative age. Among these
mechanisms, the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway involves ligation of
the free ends flanking the double strand break15. The other main class of DSB
repair mechanisms are the homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanisms, which
make use of sequence homology between the break-site and a repair template.
Regulation of homology-directed repair can have significant consequences for the
genome. This is due to the ability of different HDR mechanisms to change allele
copy numbers and lead to recombination between chromosomes. The relative usage
and efficiency of different DSB repair mechanisms depend on factors including cellcycle stage, ploidy, and cell type15, 16, 17, 18. Previous studies have detected changes in
repair pathway usage between chronologically old and young tissues, that could
indicate age-related changes in repair efficiency19, 20. However, how the repair
efficiency of specific DSB repair pathways longitudinally changes in mitotically
aging single cells remains unexplored.
Here we assess whether the efficiency of DSB repair via the single-strand
annealing (SSA) pathway changes with the age of the host cell. The SSA pathway
repairs double strand breaks occurring between direct repeats of an identical
sequence, resulting in deletion of the intermediate sequence (Fig. 1a)15. Repetitive
sequences play important roles in cellular function, with the rDNA locus being one
prominent example21, 22. An age-related change in the efficiency of SSA, which
would lead to differences in the copy numbers of the repeated sequence, would be
expected to have important consequences for the cell. Since SSA and other
homology-directed repair pathways share regulatory aspects such as end-resection
and Rad52 recruitment to the repair sites, understanding how SSA efficiency
changes with age can provide key insight into whether the efficiency of other
homology-directed repair mechanisms would also change with age. Using a singlecell longitudinal approach23 in a haploid genetic background, we measure the
efficiency of single-strand annealing repair in young and older cells. We further
explore age-related changes in SSA repair efficiency as they relate to age-related
changes in cell cycle, non-homologous end joining pathway activity, and in terms of
the amount of heterology between the SSA repeats.

RESULTS
Developing a single-cell SSA repair reporter and experimental design
Cells were aged in a microfluidic chip (Fig. 1b) to obtain either young or old cells in
which to measure SSA efficiency. To control the age at which SSA repair is

assessed, we used a haploid strain in which the endonuclease I-SceI is expressed
under the doxycycline-inducible PTETO4 promoter. To measure SSA, we developed an
SSA reporter containing an I-SceI cut site between two nonfunctional YFP repeats
integrated at the chromosomal ura3 locus. If SSA repair occurs using the two YFP
repeats of the reporter, then a functional YFP is formed and detected in single cells
aging in real-time (Fig. 1c). For direct detection of whether cutting occurred or not,
an RFP reporter is constitutively expressed from the genomic region between the
two non-functional YFP repeats; cutting is detected by the dilution of RFP
concentration that results from a halt in RFP expression during continued cell
growth. The I-SceI cut-site consists of two adjacent 18 bp I-SceI recognition
sequences in inverted orientation so that after two I-SceI cleavages the DNA ends
flanking the break are incompatable24. This situation is more representative of
naturally occurring DSBs24. We also used a control strain identical to the strain
carrying the SSA repair cassette, except for the absence of the I-SceI cut site.
For inducing I-SceI expression and cutting, we chose a 4-hour time window
during which cells were exposed to doxycycline (dox). SSA repair efficiency was
measured in separate experiments targeting young or older cells. Repair efficiency
was quantified using the fraction of initially YFP- cells that became YFP+ within the
9 hour period (4 hours of dox treatment plus 5 hours of post-dox inspection) after
addition of dox. A cutoff-based approach was used to determine whether a cell was
YFP- or YFP+ at any given time (Fig. S2). Only cells that were observed to be alive
within the 5-hour post-dox time window were considered. For the SSA repair
experiments in young cells, the average age of those cells was 2.6 generations at the
beginning of the dox treatment. In the experiments with old cells, the average age
was 18.1 generations at the beginning of the dox treatment (Fig. 2a, Fig. S1), which
is close to the average age of the haploid yeast at ~23 generations25. The two
expected phenotypes of YFP appearance, or its absence, were observed and
quantified across individual cells longitudinally (Fig. 2b, Fig. S3a,b, Fig. S4).
Measuring SSA repair efficiency in young and old cells
The SSA repair efficiency for the old cells was significantly lower than that of the
young cells (71.8% vs. 93.8%), indicating an age-associated decline in SSA repair
(Fig. 2c; P-value 0.003, Fisher’s exact test). The fraction of unrepaired old cells that
were repaired in the subsequent 5-hour time window after dox removal was also
found to be low (1/11) (Fig. S5). Therefore, the absence of repair at the 9-hour time
point was not simply due to a small reduction in the speed of repair. Additionally,
the average time after dox addition at which YFP first appeared was similar
between the old and young repaired cells, indicating that aging does not

significantly affect the speed of SSA repair in cells that are able to carry out SSA
repair (Fig. S4). To assess whether cells were arresting their cell cycle due to
cutting by I-SceI, we calculated the average budding time experienced by cells in
the 4-hour time interval before dox addition, and the 9-hour time interval after dox
addition. We compared this to the corresponding average budding times calculated
for the control strain lacking an I-SceI cut site. In the time window prior to
doxycycline treatment, the two strains show similar average budding times (Fig. 2d)
for the same age groups. Consistent with I-SceI cleavage resulting in cell-cycle
arrest, average budding times after dox addition are higher in the strain containing
the cutsite, compared to the control strain without the cutsite. After dox addition,
the strain containing the cut-site had an average budding time of 153±23 min in old
cells compared to 112 ± 1min for the old cells of the control strain (Fig. 2d).
Therefore, induction of the DSB leads to longer cell-cycle durations on average.
To determine whether the unrepaired YFP- cells were arrested in their cell
cycle consistent with cutting and failure to repair, we considered the time that had
passed since these cells last started forming a daughter bud. Since the first
appearance of a daughter bud corresponds to early S-phase, the amount of time
since the previous bud initiation can include the G1 phase of the subsequent cell
cycle. If the cells are arrested in G2/M phase, on the other hand, this time period
only includes the S/G2/M phase of the same cell cycle. Compared to the YFP+
repaired cells, cells that were YFP- at the 9th-hour time point after doxycycline
addition had not budded for a longer period of time (Fig. S6). These unrepaired cells
are therefore either arrested for a long time in G2/M or went through mitosis before
experiencing a long G1 in the subsequent cell cycle.
To determine whether the cells that failed to produce YFP by SSA repair
exhibited any cell cycle delays consistent with a DSB-induced cell cycle arrest, we
measured the average budding interval of each cell in three non-overlapping time
windows: the 4-hour window prior to doxycycline treatment, the 4-hour window
coinciding with doxycycline treatment, and the 5-hour window after doxycycline
treatment. The old YFP- cells exhibited slightly longer average budding intervals
prior to doxycycline addition compared to the old cells that were eventually repaired
(Fig. S7a). During the 4-hours of doxycycline exposure and the 5-hour period after
doxycycline exposure, both YFP+ and YFP- cells showed an increased average
budding interval compared to the control strain (Fig. S7b, S7c). Average budding
intervals in the 5-hour post-doxycycline time window for young YFP- cells were far
longer than those for young cells of the SSA control strain lacking a cutsite (Fig.
S7c). These results suggest that cutting efficiency is 100% efficient in young cells.
For old cells, on the other hand, the considerable overlap in average budding

interval for YFP- cells and control cells lacking a cutsite makes budding interval a
poor measure of cutting efficiency (Fig. S7c), necessitating the use of more direct
approaches – such as the RFP reporter used in this study – for determining cutting
efficiency.
Direct measurement of I-SceI cutting efficiency in old cells
The age-associated decline in SSA repair efficiency could be due to several factors.
First, the cells could be cut and failing to complete repair using SSA. Second,
weaker induction of I-SceI in old cells could result in a lower rate of cutting. A third
possibility is that the cells in which YFP fails to appear are actually cut by I-SceI,
but repaired by a different repair pathway like NHEJ or MMEJ (Microhomology
Mediated End Joining) that does not generate functional YFP. To address the
possibility of decreased cutting efficiency by I-SceI in old cells, we constructed a
strain in which the RFP originally introduced between the two non-functional YFP
repeats was further tagged with a degron. The degron tag we used is a truncation of
the C-terminal destabilization motif from the cyclin protein Cln2 and it leads to the
fast degradation of Cln2 and RFP. The stability of the original non-tagged RFP
results in poor detection of any cutting due to the longer time and continued growth
requirement for the detection of RFP loss after cutting. In the strain carrying the
degron-tagged RFP, a halt in RFP transcription due to cutting by I-SceI is expected
to result in a rapid and prolonged decline in RFP transcription. At the 9th-hour time
point after doxycycline addition, we measured the length of time that each cell had
been RFP- using a fixed cutoff for RFP (Fig. 3a, Fig. S8). Soon after addition of
doxycycline, young and old cells of this strain showed a rapid and lasting decline in
RFP expression that did not occur in old cells of a control strain containing the RFPdegron fusion, but without a cutsite (Fig. 3b, Fig. S3h,i,j). Since old cells of the
cuttable and control strains, both containing the SSA cassette and degron-tagged
RFP, have similar RFP expression levels prior to the decline in RFP expression, we
conclude that the difference in the metric of “RFP- duration” is not due to
differences in promoter activity (Fig. 3c). Only one of 58 (1.7%) old cells of the
cutsite-free strain containing the RFP degron lost RFP expression for over 4.5
hours. 98% of all old, initially YFP- cells from the SSA strain carrying degrontagged RFP showed either a decline in RFP signal to background levels for over 4.5
hours, or production of functional YFP. Based on these results, we concluded that ISceI cutting in old cells was very efficient. Therefore, the observed decline in SSA
repair efficiency in old cells compared to young cells is due to either decreased SSA
repair efficiency or increased efficiency of competing repair pathways.

Measuring age-associated SSA repair efficiency in the absence of NHEJ
We hypothesized that the age-related repair deficiency in the SSA repair strain was
due to increased competition from the non-homologous end joining repair pathway
in old cells. Previous work performed in young cells has shown that DSB repair is
more biased towards NHEJ during G1 phase when there is no identical sister
chromatid for homology-based repair26. Deletion of the key NHEJ proteins Ku and
Dnl4 has also been shown to increase DSB end-resection, an important step of
homologous recombination based repair pathways27.
If the decline we observed in the fraction of YFP+ cells was due to NHEJ
outcompeting SSA in old cells, and SSA itself is still fast and efficient, then
inhibition of NHEJ would increase the SSA repair efficiency in old cells back to that
of young cells. To test for this possibility, we generated a perfect-homology SSA
repair strain identical to the previous strain except with the non-homologous endjoining gene DNL4 deleted. The Dnl4 protein is a DNA ligase that is an essential
component of the NHEJ mechanism. Deleting DNL4 does not affect replicative
lifespan28. Using this strain, we performed the same type of doxycycline-induction
experiments by targeting young (average age of 2.4 generations) or older cells
(average age of 19.3 generations) (Fig S1), and measured the fraction of cells with
YFP fluorescence as a sign of SSA repair (Fig. S3e, S3f). SSA repair efficiency in
young dnl4Δ cells was 90.4% (Fig. 4a), essentially unaffected by the deletion
compared to the non-deleted strain’s 93% repair efficiency. In old dnl4Δ cells, we
measured a 65.0% SSA repair efficiency compared to the 70.0% SSA repair
efficiency in the old cells of the non-deleted strain (Fig. 4a). As with the DNL4
intact strain, only a small fraction of the dnl4Δ cells that were unrepaired at the 9hour post-doxycycline time point were repaired in the subsequent 5 hours (Fig. S5).
In the 9 hours after doxycycline addition, the average budding time was 156±16
min for old cells and 102±18 min for young cells, similar to the corresponding
values for the strain with intact DNL4 (Fig. 4b). In this strain, the ratio of the
repair efficiency in old cells to the one in young cells was 0.719, very similar to the
ratio measured in the SSA strain with intact DNL4 (Fig. S11). Consistent with this,
the ratio of average budding interval in the 9-hour post-doxycycline time window
between old and young cells of this strain was also similar to the ratio for the strain
with intact DNL4 (Fig. S12). The lack of increase in the SSA repair efficiency when
the NHEJ repair mechanism is inactive suggests that increased usage of NHEJ is
not the cause of the age-specific inefficiency in SSA-based repair.
The role of changes in cell-cycle progression on SSA repair efficiency in
young vs old cells

Since eliminating Dnl4 did not restore SSA repair efficiency in old cells to the levels
observed in young cells, we next considered whether some aspect of SSA repair
itself was deficient in old cells. SSA falls under the class of homology-directed repair
mechanisms that are normally inactive in the G1 phase, and activated during other
phases of the cell cycle. It has been shown that several generations prior to the end
of their replicative lifespan, cells undergo a lengthening of the cell cycle29, 30, 31. This
increase in cell cycle duration correlates at the single-cell level with an increase in
the duration of G1 phase, and lower expression of key G1/S transition proteins
including the cyclin Cln230. Outside of G1 phase, the cyclin dependent kinase
subunit Cdc28 is activated by S- and G2-phase cyclins (Clbs) to promote homologydirected repair. Clb-activated Cdc28 promotes HDR by inhibiting the binding of the
NHEJ-promoting Ku proteins to the DSB break site and by promoting end-resection
and recruitment of HR proteins to the site10, 26, 27. An age-related increase in G1
phase duration could result in a decrease in SSA repair efficiency due to reduced
levels of Clbs that activate Cdc28’s HDR-related activities10. Since the Ku complex
prevents end-resection in the absence of Cdc28 activity, deletion of DNL4 under this
scenario would be expected to fail to activate homology-directed repair by SSA,
which was observed (Fig. 4a). Consistent with this hypothesis, we saw that old cells
containing the SSA cassette that failed to repair YFP had longer average budding
intervals in the 4-hour time window prior to doxycycline treatment compared to old
cells that were able to repair YFP (Fig. S7a, S9).
Interestingly, we observed that SSA repair efficiency in old cells of the SSA
strain containing the degron-tagged RFP was 83.6%, a number higher than the
efficiency observed in the old cells of the SSA strain containing the stable RFP
without the degron (Fig. 4c). Additionally, the speed of SSA repair in old cells of this
degron-carrying strain was fast – YFP was detected sooner in old cells of this strain
than old cells of the SSA strain with stable RFP (Fig. S4). The fractional increase in
average post-doxycycline budding interval measured for this strain was also
reduced compared to the increase in budding intervals measured for the strains
containing stable RFP, which is consistent with reduced cell-cycle arrests induced
by DSB (Fig. S12). We attribute these observations to the presence of the degron we
tagged to the RFP. The degron we used is a truncated Cln2 C-terminal
destabilization sequence found in cyclin Cln2. Cln2 is one of three G1 cyclins which
together with Cdc28 activate the transcription factor SBF32, leading to expression of
genes involved in the G1/S transition. Once the cell is out of G1 phase, the
expressed S and G2 cyclins activate Cdc28 to promote HDR26. The Cln2 C-terminal
destabilization sequence encodes protein domains that allow Cln2 to be recognized
and targeted for proteasomal degradation by the SCF E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex

containing F-box protein Grr133. Given the low abundance of Grr133, constitutive
expression of the Cln2 degron tagged to RFP could lead to competition with
endogenous Cln2 for recognition by Grr1 and subsequent degradation, which would
be expected to result in higher levels of endogenous Cln2. Indeed, deletion of Grr1
has been shown to result in increased Cln2 levels34. A higher level of Cln2 in the
degron-carrying strain would be expected to speed up the G1/S transition, resulting
in a greater percentage of cells with HDR-promoting Clb-Cdc28 activity. This would
explain the higher SSA repair efficiency observed in the strain containing the
degron-tagged RFP.
Given the above mechanism, and the previously-observed single-cell level
correlation between G1 phase duration and total budding interval in old cells30, old
cells expressing the degron-tagged RFP would be expected to have shorter budding
intervals than old cells expressing stable RFP. To assess whether this was the case,
we compared average budding intervals in two strains carrying the SSA reporter
cassette and lacking the I-SceI cutsite. One strain contained the RFP without the
degron tag while the other strain contained the degron-tagged RFP. During the 9hour post-doxycycline time window, old cells from the two strains displayed similar
average budding intervals (Fig. 4d). However, at the time of doxycycline exposure,
the average age of the degron-tagged RFP containing strain was two generations
greater than that of the stable RFP containing strain (Fig. 4e). To take into
consideration this age difference, we next compared average budding intervals
between the two strains by using old cells going through more similar ages. For
this, we measured the average of all budding intervals occurring after the 15th
generation for each cell, and saw that cells of the degron-containing strain had
shorter budding intervals (Fig. 4f). At the single-cell level, the right tail of the
average budding interval distributions we measured after the 15th generation was
longer for the stable RFP containing strain compared to the strain carrying the
degron-tagged RFP (Fig. S10). Therefore, the difference in SSA repair efficiency
between the two strains can be attributed, at least in part, to the changes in Cln2
levels.
Assessing age-associated SSA repair efficiency using a reporter with
imperfect sequence homology
Homologous recombination is dependent on there being a high degree of homology
between the DSB site and repair template. In the context of SSA, strong homology
between the direct repeats flanking the DSB is important for repair. Previous work
showed that, in the presence of as little as 3% heterology, there can be a six-fold
reduction in the ability of cells to complete SSA repair, a phenomenon called

heteroduplex rejection35. Several mismatch repair proteins and the Sgs1 helicase
play an important role in heteroduplex rejection35. An age-related change in the
rate of heteroduplex rejection would have consequences for the mutation rate in
older cells, since heteroduplex rejection prevents recombination between
homologous sequences with high levels of sequence heterology.
To determine whether the efficiency of heteroduplex rejection changes with
age, we modified the single-strand annealing reporter to have 3% heterology
between the non-functional YFP repeats. To assess if the SSA repair sensitivity to
this level of heterology changes with age, we measured the rate of YFP repair in
young and old cells as before (Fig. S3,f,g, Fig. 5a). As with the strain containing
perfect homology (Fig. 2c), the repair efficiency in old cells was lower than it was in
young cells (27.5% vs. 34.9%, P-value 0.2787, Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 5a). Among
the young and old cells that were unrepaired at the 9-hour post-doxycycline
addition time point, only a small fraction repaired within the next 5 hours (Fig. S5),
consistent with robust heteroduplex rejection in cells from both age groups. In fact,
despite the expected reduction in the absolute fraction of repaired cells in this strain
relative to the strain with perfect homology, the ratio of the repaired-cell fraction in
old age to the one in young age (0.789) was very similar to the same ratio measured
in the strain with perfect homology (0.766) (Fig. S11). Consistent with the decline in
repair efficiency when there is sequence heterology, the average budding time of the
3%-heterology strain in the 9-hour interval after doxycycline addition was increased
to 192±4 minutes for old cells and 190±19 minutes for young cells (Fig. 5c). The
ratio of post-doxycycline budding intervals between old and young cells of this
strain was also reduced relative to the ratio measured in the strain carrying perfect
sequence homology in the SSA repair reporter cassette, indicating that the cell-cycle
delays experienced by the young cells are not matched by a proportional increase in
the delays experienced by the old cells (Fig. S12). These results indicate that there
is no replicative age-related decline in heteroduplex rejection in the context of
single-strand annealing. The processes normally responsible for heteroduplex
rejection work just as well in old cells as they do in young cells.

DISCUSSION
Repairing DNA double strand breaks is essential for cells to maintain genome
stability and homeostasis. Repair pathway dysfunction can have drastic
consequences on a variety of phenotypes in both young and old cells. Despite this,
we have very limited understanding about if and how much the efficiency of specific
DNA repair pathways change in an age-dependent manner in single cells. The lack

of extensive knowledge on this topic is in part due to the historical challenges
associated with longitudinally tracking aging cells and simultaneously measuring
repair events in them. In this study, using a reporter for detecting single-strand
annealing repair in replicatively aging yeast cells, we compared the efficiency of
SSA repair for young and old cells, and discovered an age-dependent decline in SSA
repair efficiency. Measurement of SSA repair efficiency in strains lacking a key nonhomologous end-joining protein or expressing RFP fused to a CLN2-PEST degron
provided additional insights into repair pathway usage and efficiency in the context
of aging. Finally, we further characterized the change in SSA repair efficiency
between young and old cells, in the presence of 3% sequence heterology.
An aging-related decline in the efficiency of single-strand annealing based
repair has several important implications. Since the single-strand annealing
mechanism shares molecular steps, such as end-resection, with other homologybased repair mechanisms, the molecular reasons behind the reduced SSA efficiency
in old cells are expected to affect the efficiency of other homology-based repair
mechanisms, as well. The fact that the deletion of the NHEJ protein Dnl4 fails to
increase the efficiency of SSA repair suggests that the age-dependent decline in SSA
efficiency is not due to increased competition between NHEJ and SSA mechanisms.
Given that the repair templates are located close to one another in SSA repair (2.6
kb for the YFP reporter), deficient homolog search cannot easily explain the
observed age-related decline in SSA efficiency either. The observation that old cells
of a strain containing an SSA repair reporter with RFP fused to a Cln2 degron have
higher SSA repair efficiency compared to the degron-free RFP lends support to the
mechanism that an increase in G1 duration is partly responsible for the decline in
SSA repair efficiency. The single-cell level correlation shown30 between the overall
cell-cycle duration and G1 phase duration, and our observation of shorter budding
intervals for the old cells of the degron-carrying strain, further support the
mechanism in which shorter G1 durations are behind the higher repair efficiency
measured in the old cells of the degron-carrying strain. Taken together, the agedependent decline in SSA repair efficiency (Fig. 2c) is due to the old cells’
experiencing longer G1 durations resulting in their inability to activate the steps of
the SSA repair mechanism that normally occur outside of G110, 15, such as endresection, annealing, flap cleavage, gap-filling, or ligation. While our results and the
model we propose are novel elucidations of DSB repair in the context of replicative
aging of single cells, the broad idea of cell cycle-dependent regulation of DSB repair
and the potential role of cyclins had been previously proposed in non-aging
contexts26.

Our experiments with an SSA strain containing 3% heterology between the
direct repeats showed a repair efficiency decline (between young and old cells)
similar to the decline observed in the cells of the SSA strain containing perfect
homology (Fig. S11). Since heteroduplex rejection in SSA is dependent on both
recognition of mismatches by mismatch repair proteins Msh2 and Msh6, and
unwinding of the heteroduplex by the Sgs1 helicase, this result implies that these
three proteins do not show a significant decline in activity in old cells35. Given that
an increased mutation rate from recombination between non-allelic sequences
would be detrimental to cellular fitness, it is not surprising that heteroduplex
rejection does not decline with replicative age. For the cells of the SSA strain
containing 3% heterology, the similar drop of repair efficiency in the old cells
relative to the young cells is also consistent with a model in which the factor that is
responsible for the general decline in SSA efficiency acts independently of
heteroduplex rejection.
The relationship between replicative aging and genomic stability has great
relevance to our understanding of human health and disease. An increase in
genomic instability with age has been hypothesized as a potentially reason for the
increased rate of cancer in older individuals4. In this study, we used a simple
eukaryotic model system to learn whether replicative aging actually coincides with
defective DNA repair. We show that replicative aging results in a cell-cycle
progression-related decrease in the efficiency of SSA repair, but not heteroduplex
rejection. These results raise the possibility that, while old cells show a decline in
the efficiency of homology-based repair, they do not show a decline in the efficiency
of the mechanisms that prevent aberrant recombination. The age-associated decline
we observed in SSA repair efficiency also raises questions about the repair outcome
in old cells that are unable to perform SSA repair, since alternative outcomes like
MMEJ repair or checkpoint adaptation in the absence of repair36, could adversely
affect the genome and limit replicative lifespan. Determining what repair outcomes
increase in frequency at the expense of SSA and other HDR repair pathways is
therefore an exciting research area for future exploration.

MATERIALS and METHODS
Construction of plasmids and yeast strains
All strains in this study were constructed in a BY4742 haploid strain background
with MET15 deleted and LYS2 intact. Table S1 shows the complete strain
descriptions and genotypes.
For all SSA repair reporter constructs, the 5’ non-functional mCitrine repeat
consists of the 5’ 195 bp of mCitrine followed by a TAG stop codon. The 3’ nonfunctional mCitrine repeat consists of the full 717 bp mCitrine sequence except for
the start codon. A 420 bp TEF1 promoter drives expression of the 5’ non-functional
mCitrine, with a 507 bp TEF1 terminator. A 455 bp segment of DNA from the
pRS401 plasmid (lacking homology to the rest of the repair cassette) lies between
the TEF1 terminator and I-SceI cutsite. In total, 1 kb separates the 5’ mCitrine and
the I-SceI cutsite. Directly downstream of the I-SceI cut site, a 720 bp ADH1
promoter drives mCherry with a 207 bp ADH1 terminator. Immediately
downstream of the ADH1 terminator is the 3’ ATG-less mCitrine followed by a
CYC1 terminator. Altogether, 1.6 kb separates the I-SceI cutsite from the 3’
mCitrine. The TEF1 and ADH1 promoters, and TEF1 and ADH1 terminators are
all from the S288C strain background. While mCitrine and YFP may be used
interchangeably throughout the paper, they both refer to mCitrine. Also, while
mCherry and RFP may be used interchangeably throughout the paper, they both
refer to mCherry.
The mCitrine repeats described in the above paragraph were derived from the
yeast codon optimized mCitrine on plasmid pKT021137. pKT0211 was a gift from
Kurt Thorn (Addgene plasmid # 8734). The mCherry was also yeast codon optimized
and amplified from plasmid pFA6-link-yomCherry-CaURA338. pFA6-linkyomCherry-CaURA3 was a gift from Wendell Lim & Kurt Thorn (Addgene plasmid
# 44876).
The SSA control construct is identical to the SSA repair reporter construct
described above, except that each 18bp I-SceI sequence has been replaced with the
sequence TTGACAATTATTAGTACA. The SSA repair reporter construct carrying
3% heterology is identical to the SSA repair reporter except for 6 wobble position
changes in the 5’ non-functional mCitrine. These changes occur at positions 27, 54,
81, 111, 132, and 174.
The mCherry degron (abbreviated ‘RFPdegron’) variants of the SSA reporter
constructs contain a 426 bp CLN2-C-terminal destabilization sequence tagged to the
C terminus of mCherry. This sequence is a truncation of the CLN2-C-terminal

destabilization sequence found in a plasmid containing dsGFP39. It encodes amino
acids 368-487 of Cln2 immediately followed by amino acids 525-546 of Cln2. The
truncated sequence still contains the PEST and D domains of Cln2 that are involved
in Cln2 degradation. The plasmid containing dsGFP, PTEF1-yEGFPCLN2PESTpRS406, was a gift from Claudia Vickers (Addgene plasmid #64406).
All SSA constructs were constructed in pRS306 plasmids carrying the URA3
marker. The SSA construct was located at the multicloning site with a reverse
orientation relative to the URA3 marker. For integrating the construct, long
homologies to the ura3 locus were cloned upstream of the URA3 and upstream of
the SSA reporter (distal to the URA3 marker). A 1280 bp ura3 upstream homology
with a natural BseRI cutsite at the end was cloned upstream of the plasmid’s URA3
marker. A 669 bp ura3 downstream homology with a natural AatII cutsite at the
end was cloned after the PTEF1 driving the 5’ mCitrine repeat. Digestion at the ends
of these long homologies using BseRI and AatII generated a linear fragment
containing [URA3 marker + SSA reporter] that was gel-purified and transformed to
the ura3 locus. Integration of the SSA construct was confirmed by colony PCR and
sequencing.
Regarding the system of doxycycline-inducible I-SceI expression, a variant of
rtTA (rtTA-SEG72P) was used with a less leaky PTETO4 promoter40. The yeast strain
used to amplify the rtTA variant and PTETO4 were provided by Mads Kaern. I-SceI
driven by PTETO4 contains an N terminal NLS and HA tag. The I-SceI DNA sequence
was codon optimized for yeast and designed to produce the protein sequence
described in previous work41.
Microfluidic chip construction and operation
Detailed information about the PDMS chip construction and its operation is
provided in a previous paper from our laboratory25.

Measurement and comparison of age-related changes in SSA repair
efficiency
Only cells that were initially YFP- (below threshold) before doxycycline treatment
were kept for determination of SSA repair efficiency. Cells obtained from the
experiments targeting the old age were required to be >= 15 generations old at the
beginning of the doxycycline exposure. Cells obtained from the experiments
targeting the young age were required to be <= 5 generations old at the beginning of
the doxycycline exposure. Only cells that were alive (un-bursted) and observable at

or beyond the 5-hour time window after doxycycline removal were included in
analysis. For each experimental replicate, the SSA repair efficiency was calculated
as: [(the number of cells repaired within 5 hours after dox removal) / (total number
of cells in analysis)].
For each strain, statistical significance of the observed age-related SSA repair
efficiency differences was assessed using Fisher’s Exact Test with the R function
fisher.test. Single cells from the young cell replicates were pooled together; the
same was separately done for the single cells from the old cell replicates. Fisher’s
Exact Test was applied to the 2x2 contingency table, with the rows specifying
whether the cell was in an old or young SSA repair experiment, and the columns
specifying whether the cell was repaired or not repaired based on YFP. The default
arguments of the fisher.test function were used, including a two-sided alternative
hypothesis.
An estimate for the ratio of old cells’ SSA repair efficiency to young cells’ SSA
repair efficiency was obtained by taking the ratio of the old repaired cell fraction to
the young repaired cell fraction42. Let ro be the number of repaired old cells out of no
old cells, and ry be the number of repaired young cells out of ny young cells. The
estimate is then given by the Metric: [(ro / no) / (ry / ny)]42. Assuming that the log of
this metric is approximately normally distributed, we obtain a 95% confidence
interval (CI) for it42. To calculate the standard error (SE) of the log of the Metric, we
assume that the old cell outcomes arise from a binomial distribution with no trials
and the probability of repair pold(repaired)42. Similarly, we assume that the young
cell outcomes arise from an independent binomial distribution with ny trials and the
probability of repair pyoung(repaired)42. Then our log(Metric) is an estimator for
log(pold(repaired) / pyoung(repaired)). Applying the delta method to estimate the
variance of our estimator for log(pold(repaired) / pyoung(repaired)), we obtain a
approximate variance of 1/ro + 1/ry - 1/no - 1/ny42. The square root of this approximate
variance is the standard error(SE). The 95% CI for the log(Metric) is then given by
[(ro / no) / (ry / ny)] ±1.96*SE. The error bars on Figure S5 show the antilog of this CI.

DSB induction experiments in aging cells
To study the effect of replicative age on SSA repair, cells were aged in a microfluidic
chip (Fig. 1b) designed to trap virgin mother cells and wash away budded daughter
cells. The day before each experiment, a single colony of the strain to be tested was
picked to 2 ml CSM 2% glucose and vortexed. 30 𝜇l of the suspended cells was added
to 5 ml CSM 2% glucose. After 14 hours of growth in a shaker-incubator (225 rpm)
set to 30 C, the culture was diluted and grown further so that at the time of loading

the chip, the OD600 was between 0.25 and 0.3. For strains carrying an I-SceI cut
site, the cultures were also FACS’d to determine which culture had a large fraction
of unrepaired, YFP- cells. Immediately prior to loading cells to the microfluidic chip,
the cultures were diluted to OD600 0.1. Per lane of the chip, 50-70 𝜇l of the OD600 0.1
culture was loaded at 20 𝜇l/min media flow speed. The base media used throughout
the shaker-growth phases and the microfluidic-chip experiments were always CSM
minimal media containing 2% glucose as the carbon source. After starting the
movie, media flow rate was set to alternate between at 30 𝜇l/min for 2 min and 2.0
𝜇l/min for 8.05 min.
To test SSA repair in young cells, the cells were aged for 7 hours before I-SceI
induction. For old cells, the cells were aged for 28 hours before I-SceI induction. Due
to differences in cell-division rate, a range of replicative ages are present in the chip
before I-SceI induction. Nonetheless, most cells at 7 hours are less than or equal to
5 generations old, and most cells at 28 hours are greater than or equal to 15
generations old (the average age of cells are given in the main text). Only cells in
these age ranges are selected for age-based comparison of SSA repair.
After the initial aging period without doxycycline, cells are treated with 10
ug/ml doxycycline media for 4 hours. Doxycyline-free media is restored for the
remainder of the movie. SSA repair in each cell is assessed by comparing YFP levels
prior to doxycycline treatment and after doxycycline treatment; the assessment is
made based on whether or not the YFP level of each cell increases over the
threshold level during the 9-hour time period after the addition of doxycycline (4
hours of doxycycline treatment and 5 hours afterwards).
To avoid differences in photo-toxicity prior to I-SceI induction, old and young
cells are subjected to the same period of fluorescence snapshots before doxycycline
treatment. The fluorescence part of the movie is started 140 minutes before the
addition of doxycycline-containing media. YFP/mCitrine (5% Sola intensity, 50 ms
exposure time) and mCherry (5% Sola intensity, 200 ms exposure time) snapshots
were taken every 30 minutes for the remainder of the movie. PhaseG images were
taken every 10 minutes throughout the entire movie. For the degron-tagged
mCherry containing strains (referred to as ‘RFPdegron’), the same imaging protocol
was used except that for mCherry the Sola intensity was 4% with a 200 ms
exposure time.

Cell-by-cell assessment of YFP repair
After YFP background correction, SSA repair was assessed. A YFP cutoff was first
defined, so that cells crossing and remaining above this threshold could be classified

as repaired. To determine the cutoff, cells from the SSA control strain were aged to
young or old ages (Fig. S1), and imaged by microscopy using the protocol described
in the relevant sections above. The mean and standard deviation of YFP levels in
the cells of the control strain (not having a cut site) was measured for the 5 timepoints prior to dox treatment, to determine the YFP signal due to autofluorescence.
This procedure was carried out separately for 2 replicates of young or old cells. The
mean + 5*SD was calculated and it less than 6 AU (arbitrary units) for each of the 4
replicates. Based on this, we chose a YFP threshold of 7 AU, values above which
indicate the presence of functional YFP.
An R-script was used to identify cells that crossed this 7 AU threshold and
remained above it for the remainder of the movie, and the times at which this
occurred. The script also recorded cells that crossed and remained above a 300 AU
threshold, and the times that this occurred. Cells that crossed and remained above
this 300 AU threshold were automatically classified as repaired. Since bright
neighboring cells can push the YFP signal of a cell above the 7 AU threshold, cells
in which only the 7 AU threshold was crossed were manually inspected movie-bymovie. If no bright neighboring cells were nearby the cell to analyze, the cell was
confirmed as repaired. For cells for which the crossing of the threshold was assessed
to be likely due to a bright neighbor, the later time points were inspected. If at some
later time point, YFP was above the threshold and no bright cells were nearby, then
the cell was classified as repaired and this time was recorded. If not, the cell was
recorded as unrepaired.
Additionally, the distribution of lag times between crossing of the 7 AU and
300 AU threshold was measured. Based on this distribution, lags > 4 fluorescent
measurement durations (120 min) were considered abnormal. For such cells, the
crossing of the lower threshold was considered a possible false-positive, and
manually inspected to make sure no bright neighbors were nearby. If the crossing of
the threshold was due to bright neighbor cells, the later time points were manually
scanned to find the first above-threshold YFP measurement that was clearly due to
the cell of interest’s internal fluorescence.

Cell-by-cell assessment of RFP absence in the degron-carrying strain
To determine a cutoff for detecting the absence of mCherry (abbreviated ‘RFP’)
expression in cells containing the the degron-tagged RFP within the SSA repair
reporter cassette, we measured single-cell RFP levels by quantifying average RFP
pixel intensities in YFP+ cells. Formation of functional YFP is contingent on loss of
the mCherry+degron cassette after cutting. RFP measurements from these cells

provide a measure of the intracellular RFP signal as well as cellular
autofluorescence and background fluorescence. The RFP cutoff was chosen to be the
95% quantile of the single-cell RFP measurements pooled from the cells that were
always observed to be YFP+ (Fig. S5). Any RFP expression level below this cutoff
was treated as RFP negative while any level above the cutoff was treated as RFP
positive.

Average budding interval measurements
To have a measure of I-SceI DSB-induced cell-cycle arrests, the average budding
interval for 3 different time windows was measured: the 4-hour window prior to
doxycycline addition (‘pre-dox’), the 4-hour window during doxycycline treatment,
and the 5-hour window after doxycycline removal. The average budding interval for
the 9-hour time window after doxycycline addition (including the 5-hour time
window after doxycycline removal) was also measured. Here, budding interval
refers to the difference in time between the appearances of consecutive daughter
buds from the same mother cell. For each cell, the budding intervals fully contained
within the time window of interest were measured. The full budding interval
beginning before, but ending within, the time window of interest was also
measured. For each cell and time window of interest, the final partial budding
interval was defined as the time between the appearance of the last daughter bud in
the time window of interest and the end of that time window. The purpose of
measuring this partial budding interval was to be able to detect cell-cycle arrested
cells. The average of the final partial budding interval and the full budding
intervals measured in the time window of interest was then calculated.

Image processing
Fluorescence frames were aligned based on non-fluorescent PhaseG images using
NIKON NIS Elements software’s image-alignment method, and exported as tifs. A
custom Matlab script was used to automatically draw a standard polygon within
each trap of the microfluidic chip and save the corresponding binary masks. Masks
were manually inspected to make sure the polygons were placed correctly within
each trap, so that they would fall within the tracked cells. The masks were applied
to the fluorescent images to obtain average mCitrine (‘YFP’) and mCherry (‘RFP’)
pixel intensities within each polygon for all time frames in the movie. For situations
in which the polygonal region of interest was not fully contained within the cell, a
polygon was manually drawn within the cell of interest.

Background fluorescence was subtracted from the cell-specific fluoresence
measurements to obtain a more accurate measure of RFP and YFP levels in the cell.
Due to spatial and temporal homogeneity in background fluorescence, background
fluorescence was obtained for a local, rectangular region around each cell of
interest. A custom Matlab GUI was written to identify any non-background region
(cell or PDMS) in each rectangle for all time-points of observation. These pixels
were excluded in calculating the local background. The average pixel intensity of all
background pixels in the local rectangle was defined as the background signal.
A source of error would be present when very bright cells/objects are directly
adjacent to the cell of interest. This is not accounted for by the local background
pixel average method described above, which includes further away pixels not
influenced by the fluorescence of the bright object. To identify these situations,
adjacent, non-daughter objects were circled manually using a custom Matlab GUI.
If the average pixel intensity of these adjacent objects was greater than 200 AU and
if the objects were less than 15 pixels away from the center of the polygonal region
of interest, then the local background quantification method described above was
not used. Instead, if possible, a test ROI to measure the effect of the bright neighbor
object on background was drawn at the same relative distance as the trapped cell
ROI. Then, for a given mother cell, the average pixel intensities of these test ROIs
was averaged and used as the background to be subtracted.

Figure 1. Schematics of the experimental system and SSA repair
measurements. a. Diagram showing the steps of single-strand annealing based
repair. The direct repeats are highlighted in blue. The upper row shows the
situation immediately after the double strand break. b. Schematic showing the
setup of the experiment. The yeast replicator device allows replicative aging of yeast
to be observed using a microscope. Fresh media is supplied, and waste removed over
the course of the movie. A microscope image of a trapped yeast cell is shown above
the chip. c. Genetic constructs used to measure SSA. rtTA is expressed from the
constitutive PMYO2 promoter. In the presence of doxycycline, rtTA activates
expression of I-SceI from a non-leaky PTETO4 promoter. I-SceI cutsite consists of a
pair of inverted 18 bp I-SceI sites placed within the SSA reporter. The nonfluorescent 5’ YFP repeat contains only the 5’ 192 bp of YFP. The 3’ YFP repeat is
not expressed because it consists of the entire YFP ORF except for the start codon.
Between the TEF1 terminator and 3’ YFP repeat is a 2.1 kb stretch of DNA (dotted
line), with inverted I-SceI cut sites at a distance of 0.5 kb from the TEF1
terminator. Between the I-SceI cutsite and the 3’ non-functional YFP is an ADH1
promoter driving mCherry (abbreviated by ‘RFP’). Degron-tagged RFP expression
below a threshold was used as a reporter for DNA cutting. After SSA repair occurs
between the repeats, the resulting product is a full length YFP with a start codon.

with the red trajectory representing successful SSA repair. c. The fraction of cells
with successful SSA repair was calculated for each experimental replicate. Shown
are mean+/-SEM (N=2) by age group for the fraction of repaired cells. The old cell
replicates had a mean repair efficiency of 71.8% compared to a mean repair
efficiency of 93.8% for the young cell replicates. The p-value of 0.003 is for a twosided Fisher’s Exact Test for association between repair and age on pooled data. d.
Shown are the mean+/-SEM (N=2) of the average budding intervals measured from
individual cells of the two replicates before and after doxycycline addition. Pre-dox
corresponds to the 4-hour time window before doxycycline addition. Post-dox
corresponds to the 9-hour time window after doxycycline addition. At both young
and old ages, the strain carrying the SSA repair reporter exhibits increased budding
interval relative to the control strain, indicative of DNA damage-induced cell-cycle
arrest (from 74+/-1 min to 102+/-8 min in young cells with the cutsite; from 84+/-9
min to 153+/-23 min in old cells with the cutsite).
Figure 3. Directly measuring I-SceI cutting efficiency using a degrontagged mCherry (‘RFP’) in the SSA repair cassette. a. An RFP cutoff was
applied to cells from two strains containing a degron-tagged mCherry (abbreviated
‘RFP’) within an SSA repair reporter: one strain contained an I-SceI cutsite while
the other lacked the cutsite. For each cell analyzed, the duration of RFP absence
was quantified between the first occurrence of below-cutoff RFP level and the end of
the 9-hour post-doxycycline time window. b. The duration of RFP absence is shown
for old and young cells of the strain containing a degron-tagged RFP within an SSA
repair reporter and old cells of the same strain missing the I-SceI cutsite. 43 of the
58 old cells (corresponding to 74%) analyzed from the second strain missing the
cutsite had a duration of RFP absence quantified as 0 min, compared to 1 out of the
79 old cells from the first strain carrying the cutsite. Using pooled data from two
independent experiments, the box plots show the distribution of the single-cell RFPdurations for each cell. c. For each cell that was missing RFP (expression below the
cutoff) at the 9th hour time point after doxycycline addition, the RFP values of each
cell measured prior to their being below cutoff were measured and averaged for
each cell. Using pooled data from two independent experiments, the box plots show
the distribution of the single-cell-averaged RFP values corresponding to each cell’s
RFP+ period. The RFP values corresponding to the RFP+ period are similar between
old cells of the two degron-tagged SSA reporter strains, with and without the
cutsite.

Figure 4. The age-associated decline in SSA repair efficiency is due to
changes in cell-cycle progression in old cells. a. dnl4∆ cells fail to show an
increase in SSA repair efficiency when old. The mean repair efficiency for old cells
(N=2 replicates) was 65.0%, while for young replicates (N=2), it was 90.4%. The
mean and SEM (N=2) of these replicate-based statistics are shown. The p-value of
0.0016 is for a two-sided Fisher’s Exact Test to test for association between repair
and age. b. Shown are the mean+/-SEM (N=2) of the average budding intervals
measured from individual cells of the two replicates during the 4-hour predoxycycline addition, and 9-hour post-doxycycline addition time window. The dnl4∆
strain shows a large increase in budding interval after doxcycycline treatment
regardless of age (from 71+/-1 min to 103+/-16 min in young cells; from 77+/-1 min
to 156+/-16 min in old cells). c. The strain containing a degron-tagged mCherry
(‘RFP’) within the SSA repair reporter has higher SSA repair efficiency in old cells.
d. Average budding intervals (‘times’) during the 9-hour post-doxycycline time
window are similar in old cells of the SSAcontrol strain (no cutsite) carrying degrontagged mCherry (‘SSAcontrol+RFPdegron’), and old cells of the SSAcontrol strain
carrying stable mCherry (‘SSAcontrol’). Shown are mean+/-SEM (N=2) of the
average budding intervals measured from individual cells of two replicate
experiments, pre-dox (during the 4-hour time window before doxycycline addition)
and post-dox (during the 9-hour time window after doxycycline addition). In old
cells, the average post-dox budding interval was 115+/-6 min for the RFPdegroncarrying control strain, and 111+/-8 min for the stable-RFP-carrying control strain.
e. Single-cell ages at the start of doxycycline treatment for the old age groups of the
SSAcontrol strains (no cutsite) with stable RFP or degron-tagged RFP (for which
average budding intervals were calculated in this panel). Mean+/-SEM (N=2) of
replicate-based averages are overlaid on single-cell age values pooled from two
replicates; the average age is 18.5 generations for the strain with stable RFP, and
20.3 generations for the strain with the degron-tagged RFP. f. Average budding
intervals measured for old cells of the SSAcontrol strains (no cutsite), with stable
RFP or degron-tagged RFP. Only generations larger than 15 were considered for
cells of age 15 generations or older at the time of doxycycline addition. Mean+/-SEM
(N=2) of replicate-based averages of single-cell-averaged budding intervals are
shown. The mean values are 117+/-1 min for the strain with the stable RFP, and
96+/-6 min for the strain with the degron-tagged RFP.

mean and SEM (N=2 or 5) of these replicate-based statistics are shown. The
replicates (N=5) of the old cells had a mean repair efficiency of 27.5%, while the
replicates (N=2) of the young cells had a mean repair efficiency of 34.9%. The pvalue of 0.2787 is for a two-sided Fisher’s Exact Test to test for association between
repair and age. b. Shown are the mean+/-SEM (N=2) of the average budding
intervals measured from individual cells of the two replicates during the 4-hour
time window before, and the 9-hour time window after doxycycline addition. Cells
exhibit an especially large increase in cell-cycle duration after doxycycline
treatment (from 75+/-7 min to 161+/-18 min for young cells; from 74+/-3 min to
169+/-7 min for old cells).
