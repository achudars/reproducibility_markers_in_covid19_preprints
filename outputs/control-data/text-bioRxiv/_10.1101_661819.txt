Objective

20

Obesity is associated with telomere attrition – a marker of cellular and biological aging. The US

21

has the highest proportion of obesity and is comprised of a racially/ethnic diverse population.

22

Little is known about the relationship between obesity and telomere attrition according to

23

race/ethnicity in the US. Our objective is to examine the differential association.

Design and setting

25

The effect of body mass index (BMI), % total body fat (TBF) and waist circumference (WC) on

26

leukocyte telomere length (LTL) were examined as adiposity measures according to

27

race/ethnicity and sex specific race/ethnicity using separate adjusted linear regressions on a

28

sample of 4,919 respondents aged 20-84 years from cross-sectional 1999-2002 data using the US

29

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Mediation analyses assessed health

30

behaviors associated with relationship between adiposity measures and LTL.

Results

34

African Americans (AA) experienced a 28% and 11% decrease in LTL associated with

35

increasing BMI and WC, (p=.02 and .03) respectively. Mexican Americans (MA) experienced a

36

33% decrease in LTL associated with increasing %TBF (p=.04). Whites experienced a 19%,

37

23%, and .08% decrease in LTL associated with increasing BMI, %TBF, and WC, (p=.05, .003,

38

.02) respectively. White men experienced a 26% decrease in LTL due to increasing BMI (p=.05).

39

AA women experienced a 41%, 44%, and 16% decrease in LTL due to increasing BMI, %TBF,

40

and WC, respectively (p=.007, .02, .04). White women experienced a 29% decrease in LTL

41

associated with increasing %TBF (p=.006). Selected health behaviors were associated with the

42

relationship between adiposity measures and LTL.

Conclusion

44

Overall, AA and Whites have worse cellular and biological aging related to collective adiposity

45

measures. According to sex, AA women experienced more deleterious cellular and biological

aging. Findings suggest tailored interventions to improve adverse behaviors that contribute to

Introduction

49

Secular rates of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been

50

declining among US adults across all racial/ethnic groups.[1] Obesity rates, on the other hand,

51

have increased. [2] Worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975.[3] The US has the highest

52

proportion of obesity.[2] More than one-third of US adults are obese.[4] Prevalence rates differ

53

by race/ethnicity and by sex according to race/ethnicity.[4] Obesity is a major risk factor for

54

many age-related CVD chronic conditions such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes and

55

dyslipidemia which increases the risk for heart failure, heart attack and stroke.[5] It is the leading

56

cause of preventable deaths globally and occurs, in part, due to adverse modifiable lifestyle

57

behaviors such as sedentary physical activity and unhealthy diet.[3]

58

Telomeres are the DNA-protein complex at the ends of chromosomes.[6] It consists of

59

highly conserved tandem hexameric nucleotide repeats (TTAGGG). Telomere are needed for the

60

replication of DNA and provides protection to chromosomes from nuclease degradation and

61

cellular senescence which promotions the integrity and stability of chromosomes. During the

62

cellular process, telomeres progressively shorten with each cell division. When telomeres shorten

63

to a critical length, replicative senescence is triggered resulting in cell-cycle arrest.[7] In human

64

peripheral leukocytes, telomere shortening has been demonstrated to be a maker for cellular and

65

biologic aging as well as a biomarker for age-related diseases such as CVD.[8] Evidence shows

66

that the pathways through which obesity promotes morbidities include increasing systemic

67

inflammation and oxidative stress; inflammation and oxidative stress have also been linked to

68

telomere attrition.[9-11] Studies have investigated the relationship between adiposity and

69

telomere length. Such studies have produced equivocal results [12-20]. Studies have also

70

examined the association between adverse lifestyle health behaviors and telomere length with

71

similar mixed results. [19, 21-26] One factor that may account for these conflicting findings may

72

be inadequate statistical power due to small sample size, study design, and sample

73

characteristics. Little is known about racial/ethnic differences between adiposity and telomere

74

length. In addition, we are unaware of any studies that have investigated adverse health

75

behaviors as a pathway associated with adiposity and telomere length. The objective of our

76

research was to examine a large US representative, socioeconomically and racially/ethnic diverse

77

population. This represents the first study to examine adiposity and telomere length according to

78

race/ethnicity, sex according to race/ethnicity and mediating pathways due to adverse lifestyle in

79

the US. We hypothesize that the association between telomere length and adiposity will be

80

moderated by race/ethnicity and sex. We further hypothesize that adverse health behaviors will

81

have a mediating effect between adiposity and telomere length. Findings will provide important

82

information about the rate of biological aging due to telomere length and adiposity across major

83

race/ethnic groups in the US and according to corresponding sex; as well as the implications

84

associated with adverse health behaviors.

85

Materials and Methods

86

Study design and sampling procedures

87

Data was collected from the 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 cycles of the National Health and

88

Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This is a nationally representative cross-sectional

89

survey and physical examination of civilian, noninstitutionalized US population conducted by

90

the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since 1960.[27] NHANES utilizes a

91

4- stage sampling design which includes 1) primary sampling units (PSUs) consisting of single

4

92

counties, 2) area segments within PSUs, 3) households within segment areas, and 4) persons

93

within households. On average 2-3 individuals per household were sampled. NHANES 1999-

94

2002 oversampled low-income individuals, African Americans and Mexican Americans to

95

obtain more accurate estimates in these populations. All respondents aged >20 during this period

96

were asked to provided DNA specimens to establish a national probability sample of genetic

97

material for future research. DNA from the most recent NHANES is only available in the form

98

of crude lysates of cell lines thereby precluding the assay of leukocyte telomere length (LTL).

99

However, DNA collected during 1999-2002 is purified from whole blood thus facilitating the

100

assay of LTL. Pooled data were available for public download

101

(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes_questionnaires.htm).

102

Of the 10,291 respondents eligible to provided DNA, 7,825 provided DNA and consented

103

to future genetic research. We excluded 653 respondents whose self-reported race/ethnicity was

104

“other” or “other Hispanic,” since our goal was to examine more discrete self-reported

105

race/ethnic groups (i.e. White, African American, Mexican American). We also excluded 225

106

respondents aged >85 because of survival bias among the extreme elderly.[28] An additional

107

2,037 were excluded due to missing data on one or more variables in the models - resulting in a

108

final sample size of 4,919. There were no significant sociodemographic differences between the

109

full sample and the final sample. Sampling weights were used to address oversampling and non-

110

response bias and to ensure that estimates are representative of the general US population.

111

Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Human subject approval was

112

provided by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the CDC and the study protocol was

113

approved by the IRB of the National Institutes of Health.

115

Aliquots of purified DNA were provided by the laboratory of the CDC. DNA was

116

isolated from whole blood using the Puregene (D-50K) kit protocol and stored at -800. The LTL

117

assay was performed in the laboratory of Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn at the University of California,

118

San Francisco, using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to measure

119

telomere length relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio).[29] The single-copy gene was

120

used as a control to normalize input DNA was human beta-globin. Each sample was assayed

121

twice. T/S ratios that fell into the 7% variability range were accepted; the average of the two was

122

taken as the final value. A third assay was run for samples with greater than 7% variability and

123

the average of the two closest T/S values was used. The inter-assay coefficient of variation was

124

4.4%.

125

Body mass index (BMI), estimated % total body fat, and waist circumference were

126

analyzed separately as measures of adiposity. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided

127

by height in meters squared (kg/m2) using a calibrated electronic digital scale and a stadiometer.

128

Estimated % total body fat was assessed using duel-energy X-ray absorptiometry of the whole

129

body that lasted 3 minutes (Hologic scanner, QDR-4500, Bedford, MA, USA). Total % body fat

130

was calculated as total body fat mass divided by total mass x 100. Waist circumference was

131

measured in centimeters using a tape measure around the trunk, at the iliac crest, crossing at the

132

mid-axillary line. The details of these assays have been described elsewhere.[30]

133

Adverse health behaviors were assessed as pathway mediators between adiposity

134

exposures and LTL outcome; these include smoking, drinking, physical activity, and diet.

135

Smoking was measured a cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke in pack-years, calculated as the

136

average number of cigarettes smoked per day times the number of years smoked divided by 20

137

(number of cigarettes in one pack).[31] Dummy variables were 30-=>59 pack years, <30 pack

138

years, and never smoked was coded as the reference. Drinking was based on daily alcohol

139

consumption defined as heavy, moderate and abstainer.[27] Heavy drinkers were defined as

140

women reporting having drunk >2 alcoholic beverages in the past 12 months per day and men

141

reporting having drunk >3 alcoholic beverages in the past 12 months per day. Moderate drinkers

142

were defined as women reporting <2 drinks per day in the past 12 months and men reporting <3

143

drinks per day in the past 12 months. Men and women reporting no alcoholic beverages in the

144

past 12 months per day were the reference and defined as abstainers. Physical activity was based

145

on guidelines provided by the Department of Health and Human Services.[32] Respondents met

146

or exceeded recommended guidelines if they reported >150->300 minutes per week of physical

147

activity, such as brisk walking, gardening, and muscle-strengthening based on total number of

148

minutes reported for each activity. Those reporting <150 minutes of physical activity per week

149

were below the recommended guidelines. Diet was based on The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)

150

developed by the US Department of Agriculture in 2005.[33] The score is the sum of 10

151

components representing different aspects of a healthy diet. Each component of the index has a

152

maximum score of 10 and a minimum score of zero. The maximum overall score for the 10

153

components combined is 100. An overall index score > 80 implies a “good” diet, an index score

154

between >51and 80 implies a diet that “needs improvement,” and an index score <51 implies a

155

“poor” diet.

156

Race/ethnicity was based on self-reported non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black and

157

Mexican American thereto referred to as White, African American and Mexican American.

158

Confounding demographic variables that may affect the relationship between adiposity and

159

telomere length included age in years at the time of the survey, age2, sex, socioeconomic status

160

based on Poverty Income Ratio (PIR), adiposity related health outcomes, markers of

161

inflammation and oxidative stress, and characteristics of the blood from which DNA was

162

extracted. PIR was calculated as the ratio of income to the poverty threshold for a household of

163

a given size and composition. PIR values below 1.00 are below the official poverty threshold as

164

defined by the US Census Bureau.[34] Adiposity related health status was based on respondents

165

answer to the questions “have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that

166

you had hypertension, also called high blood pressure and “have you ever been told by a doctor

167

or health professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?” Markers of inflammation and

168

oxidative stress included C-reactive protein (CRP) and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT)

169

measured from serum. Characteristics of the blood samples from which DNA was extracted

170

included white blood cells (µL), lymphocytes (%), monocytes (%), neutrophils (%), eosinophils

171

(%), and basophils (%).

172

Statistical methods

173

Descriptive analysis was performed stratified by total sample, African American,

174

Mexican American and White according to study variables. Continuous variables are presented

175

as means + standard deviation based on ANOVA and categorical variables as percent based on

176

chi-square. Leukocyte telomere length was log-transformed by natural logarithm prior to

177

modeling. Multivariate linear regression models were fitted to assess the relationship between

178

LTL and each adiposity measure. We report the percentage change in the average value of

179

telomere length for a one-unit change in a predictor variable based on the beta estimate for

180

telomere length as the outcome. All regression models accommodated the complex sampling

181

design of NHANES by incorporating strata and PSU indicators, as well as sample weights for the

182

genetic subsample.[35] We first compared the association between LTL and each adiposity

183

measures stratified by each race/ethnic group. We then stratified separately by sex according to

8

184

race/ethnic group. The models for stratified race/ethnic groups was adjusted for age, age2, sex,

185

PIR, hypertension status, type 2 diabetes status, CRP, GGT, white blood cells, lymphocytes,

186

monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Sex, hypertension status and type 2 diabetes

187

status were entered as categorical variables. Age, age2, PIR, CRP, GGT and the characteristics

188

of blood was entered as continuous variables. The use of age along with a age2 term is important

189

when analyzing LTL given the strength of its association with age and the potential for

190

nonlinearity in this association. The models stratified by men and women according to

191

race/ethnicity included the same adjustments as those for the race/ethnicity models – excluding

192

sex.

193

To assess the moderating effect of race/ethnicity and sex, we entered an interaction term

194

for each adiposity measure in a total aggregate model. We also examined moderating effects by

195

assessing stratified models separately according to race/ethnicity and sex by comparing

196

corresponding parameter estimate across race/ethnic groups and sex using z-test (African

197

American versus White, African American versus Mexican American, White versus Mexican

198

American, men versus women). A significant z-test suggest moderating effects of race/ethnicity

199

and sex.[36] The mediating effect of each adverse behavior between adiposity measure and LTL

200

was tested separately with a series of regression models using methodological extensions to

201

accommodate categorical mediators.[37, 38] Models included confounding variables adjusted in

202

the aggregate total model. We calculated Arioan test using standardized coefficients of the

203

indirect effects of adiposity on LTL through smoking, drinking, physical activity, and diet. A

204

significant Arioan z test suggests a significant indirect effect of adiposity measure and LTL via a

205

candidate mediator. [38] We calculated the proportion of each of the mediators associated with

the individual adiposity measure and LTL.[39] We also fitted all 4 mediators as covariates in the

207

final regression model. The mathematical equation formula for Arioan z test is:

𝑍𝑎 𝑍𝑏

Descriptive results in Table 1 reveal African Americans have longer mean LTL (1.13

213

T/S) compared to the total sample, Mexican Americans, and Whites (1.06, 1.04, 1.05 T/S,

214

respectively). The average mean age for the total sample and Whites was somewhat similar (46

215

versus 47 years) with younger age observed in African Americans and Mexican Americans (42

216

versus 38 years). The distribution of women and men was also comparable in the total sample

217

and among Whites (51% versus 49%). African Americans had a higher proportion of women; a

218

lower proportion was in Mexican Americans (53% versus 46%). The prevalence that lived

219

below poverty was lower in the aggregate sample and among Whites (18% and 14%) and a

220

higher prevalence was among African Americans and Mexican Americans (32% and 31%).

221

Mean body mass index and mean waist circumference was slightly higher among African

222

Americans (29kg/m2 and 96cm) compared to the other groups; mean % total body fat was similar

223

across all groups. A lower prevalence of African Americans and Mexican Americans smoked 30-

224

>59 pack years of cigarettes (3.3% and 1.9%); prevalence of non-smokers was also higher in

225

these groups (61% and 62%). The prevalence of all groups smoking <30 pack years of cigarettes

226

was somewhat similar. A lower prevalence of African Americans were heavy drinkers (18%)

229

abstainers was higher among African Americans (44%). A higher prevalence of African

230

Americans and Mexican Americans were below the recommended level of physical activity per

231

week (56% and 53%). The aggregate sample and Whites had a higher prevalence that

232

met/exceeded the recommended guidelines (61% and 65%). The mean HEI score was somewhat

233

comparable across groups, except slightly lower in African Americans. However, the prevalence

234

of hypertension was higher among African Americans and lower among Mexican Americans

235

(33% versus15%) but comparable in the total sample and in Whites (25%). Mexican Americans

236

as well as African Americans had a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (7% and 8%) compared

237

to a comparable lower prevalence in Whites and the total sample (5%). Mean CRP and GGT

238

was higher among African Americans (0.51mg/dL and 42U/L). White blood cell count was

239

lower in African Americans and higher in Mexican Americans compared to the other groups

240

(6.4µL versus 7.30µL). The % of lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils was higher in African

241

Americans (35%, 8.5%, .68%, respectively). However, percentages of neutrophils and

242

eosinophils were higher among Whites and the total sample (59.3% and 2.7%).

Discussion

355

The objective of our study was to assess the association between adiposity measures and

356

LTL in a representative US sample population comprised of major racial/ethnic groups and

357

demonstrate mediation effects based on adverse health behaviors. As a group, African Americans

358

experienced shorter telomere length associated with BMI and waist circumference. Whites, on

359

the other hand, experienced shorter telomere length for each of the measures. Only % total body

360

fat correlated with shorter telomere length in Mexican Americans. This finding may reflect how

361

adiposity is concentrated in Mexican Americans. We observed a steeper decline in telomere

362

length associated with BMI in African Americans compared to Whites. It has been demonstrated

363

that regional and whole-body adiposity, including skeletal muscle and bone, differ by

364

race/ethnicity and may not adequately reflect adiposity measures when comparing one

365

race/ethnic group to another.[41] Our stratified findings may support this theory.

366

When analyzed separately by sex, we found no association with any of the adiposity

367

measures and telomere length in African American or Mexican American men. African

368

American and Mexican American men tend to be leaner compared to African American and

369

Hispanic American women. [42] Only BMI was associated with shorter telomere length in

370

White men. The fact that only one adiposity measure was correlated with shorter telomere

371

length is consistent with this group having a lower overall prevalence of obesity.[42]

372

We observed opposite findings for women. For instance, African American women

373

experienced shorter telomere length related to increases in each of the adiposity measures. This

374

finding is not surprising given African American women have the highest prevalence of obesity

375

compared to men and women in other racial/ethnic groups.[42] One theory suggests African

376

American women are a unique group susceptible to obesity due to mechanisms associated with

377

dietary preferences and early childbearing.[43] It may also be due to differences in metabolism

378

and perceptions about an ideal body.[44] As with Mexican American men, we found no

379

correlation in Mexican American women associated with any of the exposure measures and

380

telomere length. We were surprise to find the lack of association in Mexican American women

381

given the high prevalence of obesity in Hispanic women.[42, 45] National prevalence rates are

383

differences within Hispanics. Our findings on Mexican American women may reflect such

384

heterogeneity and may not be indicative of obesity status in Mexican American women. Only %

385

total body fat was correlated with shorter telomere length in White women. This is not a unique

386

finding given White women have an overall lower prevalence of obesity. [42] The difference in

387

the association by sex that we observed may be due to several factors – including environmental

388

and hormonal.[11, 19]

389

Our findings regarding adverse health behaviors as mediators revealed physical activity

390

per week below the recommended guideline was a mechanism associated with the relationship

391

between BMI and shorter telomere length. 30-=>59 pack years smoked was a pathway between

392

% total body fat and shorter telomere length while an improvement in diet was associated with

393

an increase in telomere length and % total body fat. Inadequate weekly physical activity was

394

also a causal pathway between waist circumference and shorter telomere. An improvement in

395

diet was a mechanism between longer telomere length and waist circumference. Level of

396

drinking per day was not a mediator between any of the adiposity indices and telomere length.

397

There are conflicting findings regarding the relationship between adiposity and telomere

398

length in the literature.[26] Lee and colleagues, for instance, studied 345 White individuals in the

399

greater Dayton, Ohio and demonstrated individuals with higher total and abdominal adiposity

400

have shorter telomere length.[12] Findings from two studies using national NHANES data

401

similarly revealed an increase in BMI, waist circumference and % total body fat was associated

402

with a decrease in LTL in the aggregate sample which reflect our findings.[14, 15] An

403

investigation of the Cardiovascular Health Study, on the other hand, found no association

404

between telomere length and BMI and waist circumference.[16] A study by Maceneay et al of

405

67 middle-aged and older adults also revealed no correlation between normal and

women residing in Seattle, Washington revealed no association with BMI and % body fat.[19]

408

Few studies have compared the association between adiposity and telomere length

409

according to race/ethnicity and concomitant sex. We could find only one study of 317 White and

410

African American adults residing in South Carolina.[17] The investigators found no relationship

411

between BMI and visceral fat in Whites, African Americans or by sex.

412

Other studies with a racial/ethnic homogenous sample population also produced mixed

413

results. A Swedish study show selective adiposity measures were associated with a decrease in

414

telomere length only in women.[46] An investigation in Denmark revealed an inverse association

415

between BMI and telomere length.[47] A recent study found obesity was related to shorter

416

telomere length in Latina women.[48] However, a study sample of Koreans showed waist

417

circumference was negatively associated with telomere length.[49] These conflicting findings

418

between adiposity and cellular aging as measured by telomere length may be due to several

419

factors -including study design, participant characteristics, a small study sample and other

420

limitations.

421

Obesity is a major risk factor for chronic morbidities and is due, in large part, to adverse

422

modifiable lifestyle factors.[5] The predominant mechanism through which obesity may shorten

423

telomere length and increase risk of aging-related diseases include increased oxidative stress,

424

which increase telomere erosion, inflammation and accelerates leukocyte turnover.[9-11] A non-

425

biological mechanism contributing to telomere attrition may also include adverse behaviors

426

factors.[26] Several studies have established a parallel relationship between adverse lifestyle

427

factors and telomere length. Patel el al, for instance, found lack of physical activity resulted in

428

shorter telomere length among US adults.[24] A national sample of US women likewise found

429

smoking, unhealthy diet and lower physical activity was correlated with telomere attrition.[25]

430

Other investigations fail to establish a correlation.[19, 21, 22] None have assessed the

431

relationship associated with adverse lifestyle between obesity and telomere length. Our

432

investigation was designed to examine health behaviors as mediators between adiposity and

433

telomere length. Findings demonstrate selective lifestyle behavior factors as a potential causal

434

pathway. Such a relationship suggest improvements in lifestyle may reduce biological aging and

435

prevent telomere cell senescence due to obesity.

436

Limitations

437

There are some caveats to our study that require consideration. First, we do not know the

438

direction of the relationship between adiposity and LTL. Some researchers argue that selective

439

adoption may be a causal factor related to telomere length.[50] Selective adoption could occur

440

either because telomere length directly affects behavior or because behavior affects telomere

441

length, or both are affected by a third variable – such as exposure to early-life adversity. In

442

addition, telomere senescence occurs overtime and may present in some cases with a U-shaped

443

pattern.[51] The NHANES is a cross-sectional survey and changes in LTL may come before

444

exposure. Therefore, the correlations we observed should not be interpreted as causal. One way

445

to address these important issues is to design longitudinal analysis to measure the bi-directional

446

effect of differences in LTL and adiposity overtime before obesity event. Second, although we

447

adjusted for potential confounders – other unmeasured confounding factors may exist resulting in

448

“omitted variable bias” such as heritability, ancestry, menopausal status, adiposity biomarkers

449

(i.e. leptin and adiponectin) and sex-hormones that may affect our findings. Third, we measured

450

telomere length only in leukocytes. Whether our findings can be extrapolated to other tissues is

451

unclear. However, studies have demonstrated robust correlations between LTL and telomere

452

length in other tissues.[52, 53] Fourth, our mediation measures are subject to measurement error

453

even though they have been validated and proven to be accurate in other studies.[54-56]

454

Despite, these limitations, our study has many strengths. It is comprised of a

455

representative major racial/ethnic sample of US adults from which findings can be extrapolated.

456

It is among the largest and first study to investigate the association of adiposity and telomere

457

length according to race/ethnicity and sex specific race/ethnicity. Finally, we investigated the

458

causal pathway between adiposity and telomere length based on potential modifiable lifestyle

459

behavioral factors. Our detailed measurements of lifestyle and dietary factors enabled us to make

460

categories that were consistent with current guideline on lifestyle and diet which can

461

subsequently be translated into public health intervention messages.

462

Conclusion

463

Telomere length is a measure of biological and cellular aging.[11] Obesity is increasing

464

at an epidemic rate and is associated with several age-related health conditions.[5, 57] Several

465

studies have investigated the relationship between adiposity and telomere length.[12-19] Ours is

466

the first to assess such a relationship in a US representative sample according to race/ethnicity

467

and corresponding sex. Our findings reveal that African Americans and Whites have a worse

468

overall profile regarding the association between collective adiposity measures and telomere

469

length. White men experienced decreased telomere length due to increasing BMI and there was

470

no relationship observed in African American and Mexican American men. White women only

471

experienced shorter telomere length due to increasing % total body fat. African American

472

women experienced shorter telomere length associated with increases in each of the adiposity

473

measures and have a more deleterious health profile based on sex. Our findings also reveal

474

selective adverse lifestyle factors as a mechanism underlying the relationship between adiposity
