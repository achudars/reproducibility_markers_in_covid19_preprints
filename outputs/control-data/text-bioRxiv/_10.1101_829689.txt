Abstract
SMN functions via recognition of arginine symmetric-dimethylated proteins by its Tudor
domain, and scarcity of SMN leads to Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Here we report a potent
and selective antagonist targeting the Tudor domain of SMN. This compound could inhibit the
interaction between SMN and R1810me2s-POLR2A mimicking the SMN depletion results, thus
this SMN antagonist could be used as an efficient tool to better understand SMN’s biological
functions and molecular etiology in SMA.

SMN is a core component of the SMN complex, which is essential for biogenesis of small
nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) by assembling the heptameric Sm ring onto spliceosomal
snRNA1. The Tudor domain of SMN (Fig. 1a) binds to arginine symmetric-dimethylated (Rme2s)
Sm proteins, and this interaction plays a critical role in snRNP assembly2,3. Homozygous
deletion or mutation of SMN coding gene is responsible for SMA4, the most common genetic
cause of infant death with a frequency of 1 in ~10,000 births5. In addition to its role in snRNP
assembly, SMN is also involved in regulation of nuclear architecture6,7, local axonal translation
in neurons8 and transcription termination9. SMN interacts with symmetric-dimethylated R1810 at
the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) subunit POLR2A (R1810me2sPOLR2A) via its Tudor domain to regulate transcription termination9. In the SMA patients,
abnormal transcription termination such as pause of RNAP II and R-loop (DNA-RNA hybrids)
accumulation in the termination region may facilitate neurodegeneration9. All in all, SMN
functions in different biological pathways, and the Tudor domain of SMN plays a critical role in
executing these functions by mediating arginine methylation dependent interactions.

In spite of the extensive study of SMN and its associated SMA disease, it is still unclear how
SMN protects motor neurons in the spinal cord against degeneration. To this end, we set out to
design SMN-selective chemical probes that would specifically occupy the methyl-arginine
binding pocket and disrupt the Tudor domain-mediated and arginine methylation-dependent
interactions. In this study, we obtained an SMN-selective antagonist by serendipity when we
tried to screen inhibitors against the histone H3K9me3 binding tandem Tudor domain (TTD) of
UHRF1 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1a). In this fluorescence-based peptide displacement
screen for UHRF1, we found 5 hits, among which compound 1 was confirmed by Isothermal

Titration Calorimetry (ITC) (Kd ~16 µM, Supplementary Fig. 1b and 1c). As we know, many
proteins bind to lysine and arginine methylated histones/proteins, including the Tudor Royal
superfamily (Tudor, Chromodomain, PWWP and MBT) of proteins and some CW and PHD
domain containing proteins10-13, and all of these proteins utilize an aromatic cage to recognize the
methyl-lysine or methyl-arginine residue. In order to investigate the binding selectivity of
compound 1, we screened it against selected methyl-arginine or methyl-lysine-binding Tudor
domains and methyl-lysine-binding non-Tudor domains (Fig. 1c). UHRF1_TTD was the only
assayed methyl-lysine binder that measurably bound to compound 1. Intriguingly, compound 1
bound more tightly to the Tudor domains of SMN, SMNDC1, and TDRD3 than to UHRF1_TTD
(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). SMN, SMNDC1 and TDRD3 are the only three known
methyl-arginine binding single Tudor proteins. Moreover, the highly homologous Tudor domains
of SMN and SMNDC1 bound to compound 1 with a ~4-fold selectivity over that of TDRD3 (Fig.
1c).

In order to understand the structural basis of the compound 1 recognition by these reader proteins,
we determined the crystal structures of compound 1 in complex with SMN, TDRD3 and UHRF1,
respectively (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs. 3/4 and Supplementary Table 1). In the SMNcompound 1 complex structure, compound 1 bound to the aromatic cage formed by W102, Y109,
Y127 and Y130, which otherwise accommodates dimethyl-arginine (Fig. 2a-2c). W102 and
Y130 sandwich the compound 1 rings. In addition, compound 1 forms a hydrogen bond between
its imine group and the side chain of N132. This hydrogen bond boosts the ligand binding ability
of SMN because mutating N132 to alanine significantly reduced its binding affinity (Fig. 2e). In
the TDRD3-compound 1 structure, the binding mode is largely conserved (Supplementary Fig.

3), but Y566 of TDRD3 might not stack against the compound as effectively as W102 in SMN
(Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5), which may explain weaker affinity of TDRD3 (Fig. 1c).
Although we did not determine the corresponding complex structure of SND1, structure-based
sequence alignment revealed that the W102 position of SMN corresponds to F740 of SND1 (Fig.
2d and Supplementary Fig. 5). The W102F SMN mutant, like SND1, bound to compound 1 only
weakly (Fig. 2e). In addition, W102A and Y130A mutants of SMN did not bind to compound 1
(Fig. 2e). This lack of binding is consistent with our failure to observe binding for the other
tested proteins. Additional considerations apply to UHRF1 and will be discussed later. On the
other hand, cage mutations Y109A and Y127A weakened, but did not abrogate binding to
compound 1 (Fig. 2e). Hence, the sandwich stacking interactions of compound 1 by W102 and
Y130 play a critical role in the compound 1 recognition.

To uncover the specific interaction between UHRF1_TTD and compound 1, we also solved the
complex structure of UHRF1_TTD-compound 1 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Two UHRF1_TTD
molecules are present in each asymmetric unit of the UHRF1-compound 1 complex structure
(Supplementary Fig. 4a), but we only observed the expected disc-shaped electron density of
compound 1 in the histone H3K9me3-binding cage of one UHRF1_TTD molecule, while we
found a differently shaped blob in the aromatic cage of the other protein chain (Supplementary
Fig. 4b). In the complex structure of UHRF1_TTD-PHD and an H3K9me3 peptide (PDB code:
3ASK), the arginine residue R296 in the linker between the TTD and PHD of UHRF1 is found in
a pocket formed by D142, E153, A208, M224, W238 and F278 from both TTDN and TTDC14
(Supplementary Figs. 1a and 4c). R296 is fixed in the pocket by forming two salt bridges with
D142. Intriguingly, we found the expected disc-shaped density peaks consistent with compound

1 in the arginine-binding pockets of both UHRF1_TTD chains. The compound 1 molecule is
stacked between the indole ring system of W238 and the guanidinium group of R209
(Supplementary Fig. 4d).

Several lines of evidence suggested that the arginine binding pocket is the major binding site and
the methyl-lysine-binding aromatic cage is just a minor or non-specific binding site: 1. When we
mutated the aromatic cage residues that have been shown to be critical for histone H3K9me3
binding to alanine, the binding affinity is not affected significantly. In contrast, when we mutated
the arginine binding pocket residues, the binding is totally disrupted (Supplementary Fig. 4e). 2.
The electron density inside the H3K9me3 aromatic cage is either smear and can be modelled in
multiple orientations of compound 1, which implies that compound 1 does not bind to the cage
specifically, or is of no defined density shape (Supplementary Fig. 4b). 3. The aromatic cage has
a propensity to accommodate small molecules non-specifically. For instance, some buffer
molecules have been found in the aromatic cage of TDRD315. For the case of UHRF1_TTD,
some ethylene glycol molecules from the crystallization buffer are found in the H3K9me3
aromatic cage and the arginine pocket of the apo-UHRF1_TTD structure16 (Supplementary Fig.
4f). 4. In the SMN-compound 1 complex structure, compound 1 is stacked between the aromatic
rings of W102 and Y130. However, the three aromatic residues in the aromatic cage of UHRF1
are perpendicular to each other, which could not stack the compound like SMN does
(Supplementary Fig. 4g). Taken together, UHRF1 used the arginine binding pocket to
specifically bind to compound 1, and this arginine binding pocket could serve as a novel
therapeutic venue for designing potent small molecule allosteric regulators of the UHRF1
functions.

To explore structure-activity relationship between SMN and compound 1-like compounds, we
procured commercially available analogs that include single, double and triple ring molecules
and measured their affinities toward SMN and UHRF1, respectively (Fig. 1d). SMN bound to all
four triple-ring compounds with affinities between 2.6 μM to 31 μM (Fig. 1d and Supplementary
Fig. 6). The ligands have a 4-aminopyridine core in common, and none of these analogs are more
potent than the original hit. A plausible orientation of compound 1, given the electron density,
would entail a hydrogen bond between the 4-amino group and N132. Due to the electronic
similarity between the N-methyl and 4-amino sites on the 4-aminopyridine core, we did not
expect to resolve the orientation of compound 1 based on electron density alone, and could not
exclude the possibility that the amino group would instead protrude into the solvent. Binding of
1-substituted pyridine cores to SMN would confirm that N132 does interact with the amino
group and substituents on the pyridine nitrogen would point away from the Tudor domain, as
larger 1-substituents would otherwise clash inside the aromatic cage. Indeed, our crystal structure
of SMN in complex with compound 4 confirms that the imine group of compound 4 forms a
hydrogen bond with N132 (Supplementary Fig. 7a and 7b).

In addition to compounds 1 and 4, SMN also bound to two of twelve double ring compounds,
compounds 5 and 6 (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 6). Both compounds retain the amino/imino
group, which pinpoints the importance of the amino/imino group-mediated hydrogen bond in the
compound binding and is consistent with our crystal structures of SMN in complex with
compounds 1, 4, and 6 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 7). None of the single ring compounds
bound to SMN, which may not be able to provide strong enough π-π stacking interactions to hold

the compounds. UHRF1, however, did not bind to any other three-ring compounds, because the
substituents on the pyridine nitrogen of these compounds are too large for the more enclosed
arginine binding pocket of UHRF1.

We previously showed that R1810 in the CTD of the mammalian RNAP II subunit POLR2A is
symmetrically dimethylated by PRMT5 and the R1810 methylated CTD directly recruits the
Tudor domain protein SMN, which might contribute to the assembly of an R-loop resolving
complex on the RNAP II CTD9. Hence, we asked whether these small molecule antagonists
might be able to disrupt the interaction of SMN with RNAP II in vivo. To test this possibility, we
treated the HEK293 cells with 20 to 40 µM of either compound 1 or compound 2 for 72 hours,
and then performed immunoprecipitations using the cell extracts, which showed decreased levels
of interaction between POLR2A and SMN, whereas no significant effect was observed for the
cells treated with DMSO as a control (Fig. 3a). These results demonstrate the inhibitory effects
of the SMN-RNAP II interaction by the SMN small molecule antagonists. Since 20 µM of either
compound 1 or compound 2 is enough to show significant inhibition of the interaction between
SMN and POLR2A, we used this concentration in the following assays.

Our previous ChIP study has shown that SMN occupies the ACTN (β-actin) gene from its
promoter to the termination regions with the highest level of occupancy at the 3′-end of the gene9.
PRMT5 depletion or POLR2A R1810 mutation leads to a decreased SMN occupancy9. To
examine whether the SMN small molecule antagonists have any effects on the SMN occupancy
at its target genes during transcription, the SMN ChIP assay was performed using the primers
along the ACTN gene (Fig. 3b). Similar to the effects of PRMT5 depletion or POLR2A R1810

mutation, treatment of either compound 1 or compound 2 significantly reduced the levels of
SMN along the ACTN gene (Fig. 3c). Given that POLR2A CTD R1810A mutation or depletion
of SMN leads to the accumulation of RNPA II at genes9, SMN antagonists might have similar
effects. To address this issue, we performed RNAP II ChIP experiments and found that adding
20 µM of either compound 1 or compound 2 (72h) significantly increased the occupancy levels
of RNAP II at the promoter regions and 3′-end of the ACTB gene as detected by quantitative
PCR (qPCR) (Fig. 3d). These results indicate that SMN antagonists could cause the
accumulation of RNAP II at both the promoter and 3′ pause site of its target genes.

Our previous studies demonstrated that PRMT5 or SMN depletion, or POLR2A R1810 mutation
leads to the R-loop accumulation at the ACTB gene9. Here, we further confirmed that
CRISPR/Cas9 mediated SMN knock-out increased the global R-loop accumulation in HEK293
cells as detected by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3e and 3f). Over-expression of RNase H1
significantly decreased the levels of R-loops in SMN knock-out cells, validating the authenticity
of the R-loop signals (Supplementary Figure 8). Similar as SMN knock-out, treatment of either
compound 1 or compound 2 significantly increased R-loop levels in comparison to the DMSO
controls (Fig. 3g), indicating the global effects of SMN antagonists in R-loop accumulation.
Consistently, treatment of either compound 1 or compound 2 significantly increased the R-loop
signals at the 3′-end of the ACTB gene (Fig. 3h).

In summary, in this study, we identified some low micromolar antagonists of SMN, and
compound 1 shows >4-fold selectivity over other tested methyl-lysine or arginine binding
domains. Our structural and mutagenesis studies provide mechanistic insights into the selectivity

of compound 1 for SMN. Our cellular results display that SMN antagonists prevent SMN
interaction with R1810me2s-POLR2A, resulting in the over-accumulation of active RNAP II and
R-loop, mimicking the SMN depletion results. Thus, in addition to the antisense, RNAi and
CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, these potent SMN antagonists may be used as efficient tools in the
study of SMN biology and its related neurological diseases.

Methods
Protein expression and purification
The coding DNA fragments of following Tudor domains were cloned into pET28-MHL vector:
SMN (aa 82-147), UHRF1 (aa 126-285), SMNDC1 (aa 53-130), TDRD3 (aa 540-620), SND1
(aa 650-910), TDRD2 (aa 327-420), PHF1 (aa 28-87), SGF29 (aa 115-293), JMJD2A (aa 8971101), 53BP1 (aa 1483-1606). The coding regions of chromodomain of CBX7 (aa 8-62), PWWP
domain of DNMT3A (aa 275-417), and CW domain of ZCWPW2 (aa 21-78) were also
subcloned into pET28-MHL vector to generate N-terminal His-tagged fusion protein. The
recombinant proteins were overexpressed in E coli BL21 (DE3) Codon plus RIL (Stratagene) at
15 °C and purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen) followed by
TEV protease treatment to remove the tag. The proteins were further purified by Superdex75 or
Superdex200 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). For crystallization
experiments, purified proteins were concentrated to 18 mg/mL for SMN, 23 mg/mL for UHRF1
and 10 mg/mL for TDRD3 in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 1
mM DTT. All the mutations were introduced with the QuikChange II XL site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, 200522) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant proteins were
also overexpressed in E coli BL21 (DE3) Codon plus RIL (Stratagene) and purified using the

same procedures described above. The molecular weight of all protein samples was checked by
mass spectrometry.

Small molecule fragment based screening of UHRF1 tandem Tudor domain
A small molecule fragment library with 2040 compounds was screened against tandem Tudor
domain of UHRF1 by fluorescein polarization-based peptide displacement assay according to
previous reports17. Briefly, the screening was performed in 10 μL at a protein concentration of 20
μM premixed with a 40 nM FITC-labeled H3K9me3 peptide (aa 1-25, Tufts University Core
Services, Boston, MA), and then adding a single concentration of 2 mM compound in a buffer of
20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.01% Triton X-100. The hits were
further confirmed by dose response analysis. All the assays were performed in duplicate in 384well plates, using the Synergy 2 microplate reader (BioTek), with an excitation wavelength of
485 nm and an emission wavelength of 528 nm.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
For the ITC measurement, the concentrated proteins were diluted into 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl (ITC buffer); the lyophilized compounds were dissolved in the same buffer, and
the pH value was adjusted by adding 2 M NaOH or 2 M HCl. The compounds that could not be
dissolved in the ITC buffer were dissolved in DMSO with the accessible highest concentration.
Compound concentrations were estimated from the mass. For the ITC assay with compound
dissolved in DMSO, the protein was diluted by ITC buffer containing same final concentration
of DMSO. All measurements were performed in duplicate at 25 ºC, using a VP-ITC (MicroCal,
Inc.) or a Nano-ITC (TA, Inc) microcalorimeter. The protein with a concentration of 50-100 μM

was placed in the cell chamber, and the compounds with a concentration of 0.5-2 mM in syringe
was injected in 25 or 20 successive injections with a spacing of 180 s for VP-ITC or 120 s for
Nano-ITC. Nano-ITC data should be consistent with those from the regular ITC instrument,
based on ITC results of SMN-compound 1 using both regular and nano-ITC instruments. Control
experiments were performed under identical conditions to determine the heat signals that arise
from injection of the compounds into the buffer. Data were fitted using the single-site binding
model within the Origin software package (MicroCal, Inc.) or the independent model within the
Nano-Analyze software package (TA, Inc.).

Protein crystallization
For the complex crystal of SMN-compound 1, compound free crystals were crystallized in a
buffer containing 2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M potassium/sodium tartrate, 0.1 M sodium citrate,
pH 5.6 and soaked with compound 1 at a molar ratio 1:5 for 24 h. For the complex crystals of
UHRF1-compound 1, SMN-compounds 4/6 and TDRD3-compound 1, purified proteins were
mixed with the compounds at a molar ratio 1:5 and crystallized using the sitting drop vapor
diffusion method at 18 ºC by mixing 0.5 μL of the protein with 0.5 μL of the reservoir solution.
The complex of UHRF1-compound 1 was crystallized in a buffer containing 20% PEG 3350, 0.2
M magnesium nitrate; SMN-compound 4 was crystallized in a buffer containing 1.8 M sodium
acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 M Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0; SMN-compound 6 was crystallized in a buffer
containing 2 M sodium formate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0; and TDRD3-compound 1 was
crystallized in a buffer containing 1.2 M sodium citrate, 0.1 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.5. Before flashfreezing crystals in liquid nitrogen, crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant consisting of 85%
reservoir solution and 15% glycerol.

Data collection and structure determination
The program PHASER18 was used for molecular replacement (MR) when needed. Models were
interactively rebuilt, refined and validated using COOT19, REFMAC20 and MOLPROBITY21,22
software, respectively. MarvinSketch (Chemaxon.com) was used for the calculation of some
SMILES strings during preparation of small molecule geometry restraints. PDB_EXTRACT23
and CCTBX24 library were used during preparation of the crystallographic models for PDB
deposition and publication. Diffraction data and model refinement statistics for the structures are
displayed in Supplementary Table 1. Some structure determination details for specific structures

Cell Culture
HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM (SLRI media facility) plus 10% FBS (Sigma, F1051). For
analysis of SMN chemical antagonists, HEK293 cells were treated with different concentration
(0, 2, 6, 20, and 40 μM) of DMSO, compound 1 or compound 2 for 72 h. CRISPR-mediated
SMN1 gene knockout was performed according to our previous study9. Briefly, 2 μg of

BD FACSAria flow cytometry (Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto) 24 h after transfection
and single GFP-positive cells were seeded into a 48-well plate. The expression levels of SMN in
each clone were detected by immunofluorescence. The transfection of GFP-RNase H1 R-loopbinding domain (GFP-HB) for R-loop detection into HEK293 cells was performed with the

Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blot
Immunoprecipitation was performed with RIPA buffer (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH7.6-8,
1% Triton, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Roche,
05892791001) and Benzonase (Sigma, E1014) as described previously9. Briefly, 1-2 x 107 cells
were lysed on ice for 25 min by vortexing and forcing them through a 27 gauge needle. After
centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with 25 μL (1:10
dilution) protein G beads (Invitrogen, 10003D) and 1-2 μg of antibodies for 4 h to overnight. The
samples were washed three times with RIPA buffer and boiled in 1 x SDS gel sample buffer. The
input and IP samples were run on 4-12 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (BioRad, 162-0177) using Trans-Blot® SD Semi-Dry Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (BioRad, 1703940). After transference, the membranes were blocked overnight in 5% BSA in RIPA buffer.
Primary antibodies (POLR2A, Abcam monoclonal antibody, ab5408; SMN, Santa Cruz

dilutions for incubation overnight followed by three times washes with RIPA buffer, and
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, 211-032-171 or 115-035-174) were used at 1:10,000 dilutions for incubation 1
h followed by three times washes with RIPA buffer. Blots were developed using SuperSignal
West Pico or Femto (Thermo Scientific, 34079 or 34094).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP was performed using the EZ-ChIP™ A - Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore,
17-371) according to manufacturer’s instruction. Antibodies were used with a range of 1-2 μg,
and IgG (Millipore polyclonal antibody, 12-370) was used as a background control. After

immunoprecipitation, genomic DNA was de-crosslinked in ChIP elution buffer containing 5 M
NaCl at 65 °C overnight and purified with the Qiaex II kit (Qiagen, 20021) and eluted in water
for PCR amplification. Immunoprecipitated and input DNAs were used as templates for qPCR.
The qPCR primer sequences for ACTB gene are the same as described earlier9.

Immunofluorescence and microscopic R-loop quantification
Global nuclear R-loop detection was ascertained via R-loop immunofluorescence using S9.6
antibody for R-loop (Kerafast, ENH001). 24 h prior to immunofluorescence, 40,000 cells were
seeded on to Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) coated coverslips. Cells were fixed using 1% formaldehyde
for 15 min, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and then
washed again three times with PBS. Coverslips were blocked using 5% BSA for 1 h at room
temperature and transferred to humidified chambers for antibody incubations. Coverslips were
incubated with 60 μL of S9.6 (1/500 concentration) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing
with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h in a dark chamber. Following
further washing and DAPI staining, coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using
DAKO fluorescent mounting medium and then sealed with nail polish. For RNaseH1
overexpression analysis, scramble and SMN knock-out cells were seeded in 6-well plates and
transfected 24 h later with 0.9 μg pcDNA3-Empty or pcDNA3-RNaseH1. 48 h post-transfection,
cells were harvested and re-seeded onto PLL-coated coverslips, which were processed for
immunofluorescence 24 h later using S9.6 and anti-RNaseH1 (Proteintech, 15606-1-AP) to
quantify R-loop and confirm RNaseH1 overexpression, respectively. For analysis of SMN
chemical antagonists, HEK293 cells were treated with DMSO, compound 1 or compound 2
(final concentration of 20 μM) for 72 h, before being processed for S9.6 immunofluorescence.

We employed a Nikon C2+ Confocal microscope coupled to NIS-elements AR software (Nikon).
For R-loop microscopy in HEK293 cells, random fields identified by DAPI staining were
captured at 100X magnification. For any given image, 5-6 2D imaging planes were acquired
along the z-axis to generate 3D confocal image stacks. DAPI was used to create masks of nuclei
and S9.6 intensity values for individual cells were obtained as maximum intensity planes via the
NIS-elements AR (Nikon) software. Representative single-plane images from z-stacks adjusted
for background and contrast in Photoshop (Adobe) are shown.
