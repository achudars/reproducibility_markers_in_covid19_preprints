Abstract
Human Tim8a is a member of an intermembrane space chaperone network, known as the
small TIM family, which transport hydrophobic membrane proteins through this
compartment. Mutations in TIMM8A cause a neurodegenerative disease, Mohr-Tranebjærg
syndrome (MTS), which is characterised by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia and
blindness. Nothing is known about the function of hTim8a in neuronal cells and consequently
how lack of hTim8a leads to a neurodegenerative disease. We identified a novel cell-specific
function of hTim8a in the assembly of Complex IV, which is mediated through a transient
interaction with the copper chaperone COX17. Complex IV assembly defects in cells lacking
hTim8a leads to oxidative stress and changes to key apoptotic regulators, including
cytochrome c and Bax, which primes cells for cell death. Alleviation of oxidative stress using
Vitamin E rescues cells from apoptotic vulnerability. We hypothesis that enhanced sensitivity
of neuronal cells to apoptosis is the underlying mechanism of MTS.

Introduction
Mitochondria are fundamental cellular organelles governing many metabolic
processes including fatty acid oxidation, the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS), and fatty acid ß-oxidation (Kasahara and Scorrano, 2014; McBride et al.,
2006). Organelle dysfunction is associated with a broad spectrum of diseases,
including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease (Gorman et al.,
2016; Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012), and mitochondrial diseases that are genetic,
often inherited disorders associated with energy generation defects (Frazier et al.,
2017). The health and functionality of the mitochondrial network relies on the
biogenesis of >1500 nuclear encoded proteins, which are imported into the organelle
using sophisticated translocation machines (Chacinska et al., 2009; Endo and
Yamano, 2009).

The small TIM proteins form an intermembrane space chaperone network that shield
and transport hydrophobic membrane proteins (outer membrane beta-barrels and
inner membrane metabolite carriers) as they passage the aqueous intermembrane
space to membrane-localised translocation machines (Curran et al., 2002a; Curran et
al., 2002b; Endres et al., 1999; Hoppins and Nargang, 2004; Wiedemann et al., 2004).
Yeast have five small TIM chaperones, Tim8, Tim9, Tim10, Tim12 and Tim13 (Koehler
et al., 1999b; Stojanovski et al., 2012), which assemble into hexameric complexes in
the intermembrane space (Tim9-Tim10 or Tim8-Tim13) or at the inner membranelocated Translocase of the Inner Membrane 22 (TIM22) complex (Tim9-Tim10-Tim12)
(Koehler, 2004; Koehler et al., 1999a; Koehler et al., 1998). Humans have six small
TIM proteins that have been poorly characterised, these include: hTim8a, hTim8b,
hTim9, hTim10a, hTim10b, and hTim13 (Bauer et al., 1999; Gentle et al., 2007). Why
human mitochondria have two Tim8 isoforms is unclear, but hTim8a is predominately
expressed in brain (Jin et al., 1999), suggesting tissue specific functions. In line with
this, mutations in TIMM8A cause Mohr-Tranebjærg syndrome (MTS), an X-linked
recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive sensorineural

hearing loss, dystonia, cortical blindness and dysphagia (Jin et al., 1996; Koehler et
al., 1999a; Tranebjaerg et al., 1995).

We set out to investigate the function of hTim8a in human cells to gauge insight into
the pathomechanism underlying MTS. To do this, we performed CRISPR/Cas9genome editing of TIMM8A in: (i) SH-SY5Y cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line
often used as an in vitro model of neuronal function; and (ii) the widely used HEK293
cells as a comparative control so we could dissect cell-specific functions (if any) of
hTim8a. SH-SY5Y cells lacking hTim8a have defects in the assembly of Complex IV
(cytochrome c oxidase), with associated loss of mitochondrial function and metabolic
pathways that are specifically elevated in neurons, including the Aspartate/Malate
shuttle. We show that hTim8a feeds into an interaction web of Complex IV chaperones
and assembly factors, including the copper chaperones, COX17 and SCO1. Oxidative
stress and changes to key apoptotic regulators, including cytochrome c and Bax,
sensitises cells lacking hTim8a to intrinsic cell death and alleviation of oxidative stress
using Vitamin E rescues cells from this apoptotic vulnerability. This data provides a
molecular explanation for previously reported neuronal cell loss in MTS patients
(Tranebjaerg et al., 2001) and suggests that early intervention with antioxidant could
represent a treatment strategy for mitochondrial neuropathologies like MohrTranebjærg syndrome.

Results
A novel and neuronal cell-specific function of hTim8a in Complex IV biogenesis
If hTim8a functions analogous to its yeast counterpart, Tim8a, we hypothesised that
depletion or removal of the protein should have an impact on hydrophobic proteins of
the inner and outer membranes (Hoppins and Nargang, 2004; Kang et al., 2016; Kang
et al., 2017; Wiedemann et al., 2004). Therefore, we first set out to establish the
substrate spectrum of the hTim8a-hTim13 complex, and utilised the hTim9-hTim10a
complex as a comparative control. The TIMM8A and TIMM9 genes were targeted

using CRISPR/Cas9 in HEK293 to modify their expression. Genomic sequencing of
the edited cells confirmed the presence of a 1-bp insertion in TIMM8A (Supplemental
Figure 1A), while the TIMM9 edited cells revealed two indel variants bearing a 1-bp
deletion or 13-bp deletion, causing frame-shift mutations in the two alleles and new
stop codons at 2 or 4 aa beyond the wildtype hTim9 stop codon (Supplemental Figure
1B). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis on mitochondria isolated from these cells
revealed the presence of a slower migrating hTim9 mutant protein that was significantly
reduced at the steady-state level (Figure 1A, left panel). To the contrary mitochondria
from the TIMM8A modified cells showed complete loss of the hTim8a protein (Figure
1A, middle panel). Given this, we refer to these cell lines as hTim9MUT (MUT, mutant)
and hTim8aKO (KO, knockout). Given the neurological pathologies associated with
mutation in TIMM8A, we also targeted TIMM8A in the neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cell line.
We observed a mixture of modified and wild-type alleles in the isolated clone
(Supplemental Figure 1C), however isolated mitochondria had no hTim8a visible by
western blot (Figure 1A, right panel) and on mass spectrometric analyses (Figure
1B, right panel). It has been reported that the expression of hTim8a can be altered by
skewed X-chromosome inactivation (Plenge et al., 1999), thus we hypothesise that the
observed wild-type allele of TIMM8A is located on an inactive X-chromosome in these
cells. As this cell line is not a complete knockout, we refer to it as hTim8aMUT.

Having these tools in place, we addressed the functional implications of depleting
hTim9 in HEK293 cells and hTim8a in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells. Mitochondrial
from hTim9MUT cells resulted in a reduction in the steady state levels of TIM22 complex
subunits (hTim22 and Tim29) and TIM22 substrate proteins (ANT3, GC1 and hTim23)
(Figure 1A, left panel), and displayed severe assembly defects of the TIM22 complex
and the ANT3 dimer on BN-PAGE (Supplemental Figure 2A). To the contrary, lack
of functional hTim8a in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells had no obvious impact on
the TIM22 complex or substrates when analysed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1A, middle
and right panel) or BN-PAGE (Supplemental Figure 2B and 2C). It has previously

been suggested that that defects in hTim23 import and assembly into the TIM23
complex underlies MTS (Leuenberger et al., 1999; Paschen et al., 2000; Rothbauer et
al., 2001). However, both hTim8KO HEK293 and hTim8MUT SH-SY5Y cells had no
obvious impact on the TIM23 complex or Tim23 protein, suggesting an alternative
pathomechanism. Taken together this data demonstrates that hTim9 is firmly
embedded in the TIM22 complex biogenesis pathway, like its yeast counterpart, while
hTim8a does not to influence the TIM22 complex or pathway and may have alternative
function(s) within human mitochondria.

We performed label-free quantitative mass spectrometry on mitochondria isolated from
hTim9MUT, hTim8KO (HEK293) and hTim8MUT (SH-SY5Y) to obtain a global view of the
impact of their depletion on the mitochondrial proteome and mitochondrial health.
hTim9MUT mitochondria had reduced levels of hTim9 itself and its partner protein
hTim10a, as small TIM are stable as hexameric units and not as monomers (Baker et
al., 2012). In addition, TIM22 complex subunits, Tim29 and hTim10b, and numerous
mitochondrial carrier proteins (SLC25 family), including ANT1 (SLC25A4) and the
Phosphate Carrier (SLC25A3) were significantly reduced (Figure 1B, left panel and
Table 1). Conversely, hTim8aKO HEK293 mitochondria showed a decrease in the
levels of: (i) hTim13 and hTim8b; (ii) the Apoptosis Inducing Factor, AIF; (iii) the
Complex IV assembly factor, COX17; and (iv) two proteins belonging to the SLC25
family, SLC25A5 (ANT2) and SLC25A14, a previously described mitochondrial
uncoupling protein (UCP5), also known as the brain mitochondrial carrier protein 1
(BMCP1) (Kim-Han et al., 2001; Sanchis et al., 1998) (Figure 1B, middle panel and
Table 1). Mitochondria from hTim8aKO cells also displayed upregulated levels of the
pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member, Bax. The changes to AIF and Bax were not
evident in hTim9MUT mitochondria, suggesting a specific cellular response due to the
lack of hTim8a and a potential increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Looking at the
proteomic changes in hTim8aMUT SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 1B, right plot and Table 1),
we noted only two substrates were commonly reduced in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y

cells lacking hTim8a: (i) ISOC2, and (ii) COX17 (Figure 1B). COX17 is a copper
chaperone that delivers copper to Complex IV subunits, a crucial process for
subsequent Complex IV assembly (Oswald et al., 2009). In line with this, hTim8aMUT
cells displayed a striking change to both mitochondrial and nuclear encoded Complex
IV subunits and assembly factors (Figure 1B, right panel). Specifically, reduced levels
of mitochondrially-encoded COX2 (MT-CO2) and COX3 (MT-CO3) and nuclearencoded COX6A1, COX6B1, COX6C and COX7A2 were observed, while two putative
assembly factors COA5 and COX15, were upregulated. This data suggested a cell
specific function of hTim8a in neuronal-like cells in Complex IV biology. Given this, we
set out to establish if the hTim8b isoform could be performing this role in HEK293 cells
and indeed, hTim8bKO HEK293 cells (Supplemental Figure 1D) showed reduced
COX17 levels (Figure 2A and 2B and Table 2), in addition to Complex IV assembly
factors COA4, COA7 and COX16 (Figure 2B and Table 2). A quantitative analysis of
the proteomic data from both cell line models (Figure 2C) highlights a role for hTim9
(in HEK293 cells) in the biogenesis of respiratory chain complexes, in particular
Complex I. Although hTim8a seems to have little impact on respiratory chain subunits
and complexes in HEK293 cells, it has a prominent impact on Complex IV biogenesis
in SH-SY5Y cells, highlighting a cell type-specific function of hTim8a in Complex IV
biogenesis in neuroblastoma cells. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report
of a cell specific function of a protein belonging to the mitochondrial protein import
network.

hTim8a transiently interacts with COX17 under high respiratory demand to
promote Complex IV biogenesis/maturation in neuroblastoma cells
The common impact on COX17 in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y lacking hTim8a,
suggested a COX17-dependent process was being impacted in the absence of
hTim8a. Mitochondria isolated from control and hTim8aMUT SH-SY5Y cells were
analysed by BN-PAGE and confirmed the lack of hTim8b-hTim13 complex, reduced
levels of Complex I-containing supercomplex (probed with NDUFA9), and reduced

levels of Complex IV (immunoblotting with COX4 antibodies) and preferential
interaction of COX4 with supercomplexes in hTim8aMUT mitochondria (Figure 2D). We
investigated if hTim8a is required for the import and/or assembly of COX17 using in
vitro import analysis. 35S-COX17 import into mitochondria isolated from hTim8aMUT and
control SH-SY5Y cells showed normal kinetics by SDS-PAGE (Figure 2E), which was
expected given that COX17 is an established Mia40 substrate (Banci et al., 2010).
However, analysis of invitro import reactions by BN-PAGE to monitor assembly if 35SCOX17 did suggest that COX17 assembly was severely perturbed in the absence of
hTim8a (Figure 2F; ~40% less COX17 assembly compared to control).

Previous reports have indicated that growth of cells on galactose enhances their
oxidative capacity and that these cells exhibit increases in Complex IV activity and
expression (Aguer et al., 2011; Rossignol et al., 2004). We cultured control and
hTim8aMUT SH-SY5Y cells in glucose or galactose-containing media (Figure 2A, left
schematic) and analysed mitochondria isolated form these cells by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting. Both control and hTim8aMUT cells increased COX4 protein expression
(Complex IV subunit) (Figure 3A) when cultured in galactose. However, this trend was
also apparent for COX17 in hTim8aMUT cells (Figure 3A compare lanes 3 and 4),
suggesting that COX17 biogenesis is perturbed in cells lacking hTim8a. We set out to
investigate if hTim8a was interacting with COX17 to accommodate a COX17dependent process in mitochondria. hTim8aFLAG was re-expressed in hTim8aMUT SHSY5Y cells and these cells were cultured in galactose prior to mitochondrial isolation,
cross-linking with dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate (DSP) and immunoprecipitation
using FLAG antibodies (Figure 3B). Using this approach, we captured an interaction
between hTim8aFLAG and COX17 (Figure 3B). Label free quantitative mass
spectrometry analyses of the hTim8aFLAG cross link fractions revealed enrichment of
multiple Complex IV metallochaperones (SCO1), assembly factors (CMC1, COA4,
COA6, COA7 and COX6B1) and core subunit (COX4l1) (Figure 3C and Table 3),
which are all involved in the early stage of Complex IV assembly. Strikingly, we

detected a significant enrichment of SCO1 (Figure 3C and Table 3), a
metallochaperone that is known to directly transfer copper from COX17 to the core
component, COX2 of Complex IV (Leary et al., 2009). Collectively, these observations
support a novel role of hTim8a in the maturation of Complex IV through an interaction
with COX17 in SH-SY5Y cells.

Given the protein interaction profile of hTim8a in SH-SY5Y cells we questioned if it was
functioning in the copper transfer pathways mediated by COX17 and SCO1. However,
both COX17 and hTim8a are also MIA substrates that contain cysteine motifs that form
disulfide bonds in the mature proteins (Stojanovski et al., 2012). To interrogate the
nature of the hTim8aFLAG-COX17 interaction and whether it is reliant on copper or
disulfide bonds, we pre-treated isolated mitochondria with either: (i) the copper
chelator, bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS), or (ii) reduced glutathione (GSH) to reduce
the disulfide bonds prior to crosslinking/immunoprecipitation (Figure 3C). This
revealed that the transient interaction between hTim8a and COX17 was not influenced
by BCS suggesting that copper is not critical for the protein association. However, there
was a pronounced reduction in the interaction of COX17 with COX4 upon copper
chelation (Figure 3C, compare lanes 5 and 6), showing the validity of the approach.
Importantly, pre-incubation of mitochondria with GSH significantly compromised the
interaction of hTim8aFLAG with COX17 (Figure 3C, compare lanes 4 and 5), indicating
that the oxidation status of the cysteine residues in these proteins is crucial to maintain
their association within mitochondria. Together, these data show that hTim8a interacts
with COX17 in a redox sensitive-manner, and disruption of the hTim8a-COX17
interaction perturbs the downstream Complex IV assembly. The presence of COX4 in
the control eluate fraction together with COX17 (Figure 3C, lane 5) suggests that
hTim8a is binding to the COX17 pool participating in copper delivery to Complex IV
(Figure 3C) and loss of this interaction perturbs maturation of Complex IV.

Loss

mitochondrial metabolism
Complex IV dysfunction is linked to increased mitochondrial ROS and cellular toxicity
(Srinivasan and Avadhani, 2012), thus we assessed mitochondrial membrane potential
and oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y lacking hTim8a. We used hTim8KO HEK293 cells as
a control to compare the levels of mitochondrial dysfunction, if any. Incubation of cells
with the membrane potential indicator, TMRM, indicated a compromised membrane
potential in both SH-SY5Y and HEK293 cells lacking hTim8a, which was slightly more
severe in the neuronal-like cells (Figure 4A). This was not due to perturbed
mitochondrial biogenesis as citrate synthase activity, which is used as an indicator of
mitochondrial content, showed mitochondrial volume was greater in hTim8aKO cells
(Supplemental Figure 3A). To assess oxidative stress, controls, hTim8aKO and
hTim8MUT cells were either left untreated or pre-treated with the oxidative-stress
inducing agent, menadione prior to H2O2 ROS level measurement. ROS levels were
significantly elevated compared to controls in both SH-SY5Y and HEK293 cells
(Figure 4B) confirming enhanced oxidative stress in the absence of hTim8a.
Intriguingly, in spite of this mitochondrial dysfunction, both SH-SY5Y and HEK293 cells
lacking hTim8a grew at a rate comparable to wild-type cells (Figure 4C).

We looked at mitochondrial metabolism as an additional measure of mitochondrial and
cellular health. Global changes in cellular and mitochondrial metabolism by metabolite
profiling revealed a total of 200 metabolites by gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry using a targeted MRM approach in both control and hTim8aKO HEK293
cells. Fifty-nine of these metabolites were significantly altered (BH-adjusted p<0.05) in
hTim8aKO cells suggesting a distinct metabolomic footprint of these cells compared to
control HEK293 (Table 3). Analysis of detected metabolites depicted as a heatmap
with the top 40 most-significantly altered metabolites and as a pathway map
(Supplemental Figure 3B and 3C), suggested significant changes in the central
carbon metabolism of hTim8aKO cells, indicated by decreases in the levels of almost

all detected TCA cycle intermediates (including citrate, fumarate, malate), decreases
in intermediates in lower glycolysis (DHAP, GAP, 2/3PGA, lactate) and a concomitant
increase in intermediates in upper glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway
(glucose, Glc6P, Rib5P, Ru5P). These results indicate that loss of hTim8a leads to
specific defects in mitochondrial metabolism and alterations of non-mitochondrial
pathways of central carbon metabolism in HEK293 cells.

Metabolite profiling indicated that the metabolic response of SH-SY5Y cells to loss of
hTim8a, differed from that of hTim8aKO HEK293 cells (Figure 5A - 5D). In particular,
levels of many intermediates of the TCA cycle (citrate/isocitrate, fumarate, succinate)
and interconnected pathways (glutamine) were significantly elevated, rather than
reduced, in the hTim8aMUT cells (Figure 5A and 5C). Exceptionally, both malate and
aspartate were significantly reduced in hTim8aMUT cells (Figure 5A-5C). The latter
intermediates are involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle (Figure 5B, the most
affected pathway in hTim8aMUT), which is responsible for transferring NADH reducing
equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondria, and is very active in brain tissues
(McKenna et al., 2006). Another important feature that was apparent in hTim8aMUT
cells was the significant accumulation of epinephrine and striking changes in multiple
metabolite intermediates of catecholamine pathway (metabolites/pathway coloured in
pink in Figure 5A and 5C; phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism in Figure 5B), a
unique footprint observed in neuroblastoma cells lacking hTim8a but not in HEK293
cells. To further investigate whether loss of hTim8a in SH-SY5Y cells was associated
with a defect in mitochondrial metabolic fluxes and the malate-aspartate shuttle, control
and hTim8aMUT SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in glucose-DMEM supplemented with [U13

C]-glutamine, or glutamine-DMEM supplemented with [U-13C]-glucose for 2 hours,

and the time-dependent incorporation of

C into the TCA cycle and related

intermediates was quantified by GC-MS (Figure 5D). The catabolism of
and

catabolized in the TCA cycle (Figure 5D). Levels of

13

C-enrichment in different

intermediates in the two 13C-glucose labelled cell lines were similar, with the exception
of glycerol-3-phosphate, which was more highly labelled in the hTim8aMUT SH-SY5Y
line (Figure 5D).

Significant differences were observed in the levels of 13C-enrichment in 13C-glutaminefed control versus hTim8aMUT SH-SY5Y cells. Glutamine feeds into the TCA cycle via
the glutamine-glutamate-a-ketoglutarate pathway and can be used to drive
mitochondrial respiration, and the synthesis of precursors for lipid and nucleotide
biosynthesis, and neurotransmitters in neurons (Plaitakis et al., 2017). While levels of
uptake of

13

C-glutamine were not affected in the mutant line, levels of 13C-enrichment

in intermediates in the oxidative TCA cycle, starting from a-ketoglutarate (as reflected
in glutamate labelling) to malate/oxaloacetic acid were decreased by ~30% compared
to control cells (Figure 5D). Strikingly,

13

C-enrichment in citric acid was almost

completely repressed in the 13C-glutamine-fed hTim8aMUT cells, indicating that most or
all of the oxaloacetic produced in the mitochondria is exported to the cytosol as part of
the malate-aspartate shuttle. Loss of hTim8a in SH-SY5Y cells therefore appears to
lead to a decrease in the rate of utilization of glutamine, the major carbon source driving
the mitochondrial TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to decreased
production of malate and oxaloacetate and the pool of intermediates for the malateaspartate shuttle. These analyses indicate that loss of hTim8a in SH-SY5Y cells leads
to dysregulation of mitochondrial metabolism and redox balance, indicating a vital role
in neuronal cell biology.

Loss of hTim8a sensitises cells to intrinsic cell death
We set out to determine the cellular consequences of the observed mitochondrial
dysfunction and changes to mitochondrial metabolism. The proteomic data (Figure
1B) of HEK293 cells lacking hTim8a highlighted changes to apoptotic regulators,

including down-regulation in the levels of the Apoptosis Inducting Factor (AIF) and
upregulation in the pro-apoptotic Bax. Changes to AIF and Bax were not evident in
hTim9MUT mitochondria, suggesting a specific cellular response due to the lack of
hTim8a and a potential increased susceptibility to apoptosis. We confirmed changes
to the levels of AIF and Bax by western blot and also uncovered a significant
upregulation in the levels of cytochrome c (Supplemental Figure 4A). These changes
were not off-target or clonal effects, as hTim8aKO cells complemented with a
tetracycline-inducible wild-type hTim8a (hTim8aKO+WT) restored the steady-state
protein levels of Bax, cytochrome c and AIF (Supplemental Figure 4B). Alterations in
the abundance of cytochrome c and Bax were not due to large changes in their gene
expression as measured by qPCR (Supplemental Figure 4A), while the impact on
AIF was due to transcriptional regulation. Treatment of control and hTim8aKO cells with
staurosporine, resulted in a faster release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in
hTim8aKO cells (Supplemental Figure 4C), suggesting these cells were indeed more
sensitive to apoptotic induction compared to control cells (Supplemental Figure 4D).
Given that the steady state viability of hTim8aKO cells was not markedly compromised
(Figure 4C), we propose that HEK293 cells lacking hTim8a are primed for cell death
such that they can undergo a faster death upon cellular insult.

The implications of a primed for death state in neuronal cells would have greater
implications than HEK293 cells as higher organisms including humans are limited in
their ability to regenerate neuronal cells. We assessed if SH-SY5Y cells lacking hTim8
were adopting the same primed for death state. Mitochondria isolated from hTim8aMUT
cells had a significant increase in the level of cytochrome c relative to control cells
(Figure 6A), but only modest changes in the steady-state levels of AIF and Bax were
observed (Figure 5B). However, hTim8aMUT SH-SY5Y cells were more vulnerable to
staurosporine-induced apoptosis compared to control cells (Figure 6B). Apoptosis
induction is usually accompanied by remodelling of the Bcl-2 family of proteins and
caspase activation. To test if loss of hTim8a specifically leads to mitochondrial-

mediated apoptotic cell death, we challenged the cells with ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic
inhibitor of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w. Cell death and the rate of apoptosis were
significantly increased in hTim8aMUT cells and these effects were reversed when cells
were pre-treated with a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor QVD-OPh prior to addition
of ABT-737 (Figure 6C). In agreement with this, we observed increased Caspase-3
cleavage in hTim8aMUT SH-SY5Y cells when treated with STS or ABT-737. Caspase3 processing was completely inhibited in the presence of QVD-OPh (Figure 6D,
compare lanes 6 and 8 to 10 and 12), consistent with the inhibition of apoptosis.
Given that both apoptosis and ferroptosis are associated with ROS accumulation, we
also examined whether loss of hTim8a increased vulnerability to this iron-dependent,
lipid peroxidation-mediated form of regulated cell death (Dixon et al., 2012; Simon et
al., 2000; Wu et al., 2018). Treatment with specific ferroptosis inducers, including: (i)
Erastin, an SLC7A11 inhibitor; (ii) (1S,3R)-RSL3, which inhibits glutathione peroxidase
4 and (iii) buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which depletes glutathione (GSH), did not
enhance cell death of hTim8aMUT SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 6E). We conclude that loss
of hTim8a sensitises SH-SY5Y cells to Bcl-2-regulated and caspase-dependent,
intrinsic cell death.

Given the Complex IV defects in hTim8aMUT cells, we examined if the apoptotic
vulnerability of cells lacking functional hTim8a was due to the observed oxidative
stress. Challenging the cells with menadione alone increased the apoptotic
vulnerability of hTim8a-deficient SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 7A), indicating that ROS
accumulation and an impaired capacity to deal with ROS are contributing to the
heightened apoptotic vulnerability in hTim8aMUT cells. We wondered if attenuating the
oxidative stress in hTim8aMUT SH-SY5Y cells with anti-oxidants like Vitamin E (atocopherol; Vit E), an essential lipid soluble antioxidant that prevents lipid peroxidation
in cellular membranes (Traber and Atkinson, 2007; Traber and Stevens, 2011), could
lower their threshold to cell death induction. Although Vitamin E treatment did not
restore the abundance of Complex IV subunits and assembly factors, MTCO1 and

COX17 (Figure 7B), or monomeric Complex IV (Figure 7C) in hTim8aMUT
mitochondria, it did did reduce the levels of cytochrome c (Figure 7D), which was
accompanied by lowered sensitivity of these cells to apoptotic insult (Figure 7E). This
was a Vitamin E specific response as treatment with Vitamin C, which functions as a
water-soluble antioxidant (Traber and Stevens, 2011), did not rescue hTim8aMUT cells
for cell death vulnerability.

Discussion
This is the first study to comprehensively analyse the function of TIM chaperones
across cell models and our findings highlight the functional specialisation of
mitochondrial chaperones in different tissues, and open new opportunities for targeted
nutritional therapies. Comparative analysis of neuronal-like and non-neuronal cells
suggested that hTim8a facilitates the folding and/or transport of a number of substrate
proteins, although this isoform was not required for assembly of the TIM22 complex or
TIM22 protein import. In contrast, loss of hTim9 resulted in profound disruption of the
TIM22-biogenesis pathway. Importantly, we also showed no impact to the biogenesis
of hTim23 or the TIM23 complex, which has been suggested to be the underlying basis
of MTS (Rothbauer et al., 2001).

Depletion of hTim8a in SH-SY5Y cells (hTim8aMUT) had a profound impact on the
mitochondrial proteome, with a clear effect on Complex IV assembly. Complex IV is
the terminal electron acceptor of mitochondrial respiratory chain and dysfunction of this
complex is invariably associated with increased mitochondrial ROS and cellular
toxicity. Complex IV deficiency causes a clinically heterogeneous variety of
neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular disorders in childhood and adulthood and can
result from either nuclear or mitochondrial mutations (Frazier et al., 2017). Complex IV
is unique among the respiratory chain complexes as it has tissue-specific subunit
isoforms, which are believed to have regulatory roles in adaptation of tissues to specific
metabolic demands (Wallace and Fan, 2010). Six isoforms have been described for

the nuclear-encoded COX subunits: three liver/heart-type specific pairs of isoforms
(COX6A1/COX6A2, COX7A1/COX7A2, and COX8-1/COX8-2), the lung-specific
isoform COX4-2, and two testes-specific isoforms, COX6B and COX8-3. The liver
isoforms are found in tissues like brain that contain fewer mitochondria and we
observed reduced levels of COX6A1 and COX7A2 in SH-SY5Y cells, but no changes
to these subunits in the HEK293 background (hTim8aKO). COX17, which delivers Cu(I)
to the assembly factors SCO1 and COX11 that in turn deliver Cu(I) to mt-DNA-encoded
COX2, was one of few proteins reduced in all three hTim8a cell lines generated in this
study: hTim8aKO (HEK293), hTim8bKO (HEK923) and hTim8aMUT (SH-SY5Y) and
hTim8bKO, hinting at a COX17-dependent process. Our data identifies a copperindependent but redox-sensitive interaction between hTim8a and COX17, which
supports Complex IV biogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells. The presence of multiple Complex
IV metallochaperones (SCO1), assembly factors (CMC1, COA4, COA6, COA7 and
COX6B1) and core subunit (COX4l1) in the hTim8FLAG-COX17 cross-link suggests that
hTim8a is binding to the COX17 pool participating in copper delivery to Complex IV,
important for the maturation of Complex IV. In line with this, loss of functional COA6,
which is also thought to be required for delivery of Cu(I) to COX2 (Pacheu-Grau et al.,
2015; Stroud et al., 2015), results in a >1.5-fold increase in the levels of COX17,
hTim8a, hTim8b and hTim13 (Stroud et al., 2015). Intriguingly, a similar pattern of
Complex IV subunit turnover is observed in cells lacking COA6 to that observed in
hTim8aKO SH-SY5Y cells (Stroud et al., 2015), suggesting the proteins impact
Complex IV at a similar stage of its assembly.

Cell lines lacking hTim8a display heightened vulnerability to apoptotic induction due to
oxidative stress. We propose that cells lacking hTim8a are "primed" for cell death. The
term “priming” is used to describe the proximity of cells to the apoptotic threshold (Ni
Chonghaile et al., 2011) and the primed for death state is a continuum as the
magnitude of BH3 proteins priming the mitochondrion can vary continuously until the
anti-apoptotic reserve is overwhelmed and the cell commits to apoptosis (Certo et al.,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/725655; this version posted August 5, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

2006). The apoptotic sensitivity of cells lacking hTim8a was selectively rescued by
treatment with the lipid-soluble Vitamin E, but not the water-soluble Vitamin C. Vitamin
E plays a major role in protecting membranes and nervous tissues from oxidative
stress, where it scavenges peroxyl radical to maintain the integrity of long chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes (Traber and Atkinson, 2007; Traber
and Stevens, 2011). Our results therefore suggest lipid peroxidation as a potential
oxidative pathway modulated upon hTim8a loss, leading to oxidative stress-induced
apoptosis. Importantly, MTS is characterized in its end-stage by widespread and
severe neuronal cell death in the central nervous system (Hayes et al., 1998; Merchant
et al., 2001; Tranebjaerg et al., 2001). In agreement with this, cells lacking hTim8a
have significant defects in glucose catabolism and mitochondrial metabolism, both of
which are evolutionarily linked to the regulation of cell death (King and Gottlieb, 2009).
In SH-SY5Y cells, loss of hTim8a was associated with defects in glutamine catabolism
and the operation of the malate-aspartate shunt, which may underlie global changes
in redox balance and ROS production, further contributing to the acute severity of loss
of hTim8a on neuronal function (Mergenthaler et al., 2013). Changes to the malateaspartate shunt coincides with work showing that citrin and aralar1, calciumresponsive aspartate-glutamate carriers that function in the malate-aspartate shuttle,
are substrates of the hTim8a-hTim13 complex (Roesch et al., 2004). Strikingly, loss of
hTim8a in SH-SY5Y also skewed the levels of epinephrine (elevated levels) and
dopamine (lowered levels), two principal neurotransmitters, which are synthesised by
the catecholamine biosynthesis pathway, a reaction unique and essential to the central
nervous system and brain (Kobayashi, 2001).

Our data demonstrates a cell-specific function for hTim8a in the assembly of Complex
IV the SH-SY5Y cell model, an in vitro model for neuronal cell function. Previous work
by Tranebjaerg et al. highlighted neuronal loss as a prominent feature in MTS patients
(Tranebjaerg et al., 2001) and we now provide insight into the molecular features
eliciting this cell loss and show cells lacking hTim8a are sensitised to an oxidative-

stress induced intrinsic cell death. Importantly, our data highlights a strategy for early
therapeutic intervention using Vitamin E for mitochondrial neuropathologies like MTS.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culturing, siRNA transfection, transient protein expression and
stable cell line generation
Cell lines used in this work were HEK293T, Flp-In T-REx 293 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and SH-SY5Y. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Gibco) containing 5% or 10% [v/v] fetal bovine serum (FBS; In vitro
Technologies) and 0.01% penicillin-streptomycin [v/v] under an atmosphere of 5% CO2
and 95% air. Stable tetracycline inducible Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cell lines were
generated using the T-Rex system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described
(Kang et al., 2016). Briefly, cells plated overnight at 37 °C were transfected with
pcDNA5/FRT/TO-(ORF) (plasmid encoding the ORF of interest) and pOG44 (encoding
the Flp recombinase) at a 1:9 ratio (ng of DNA) using Lipofectamine 2000 prior to
selection using 200 μg/ml of Hygromycin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for positive
clones. To induce protein expression, cells were cultured in media supplemented with
1 μg/ml of tetracycline for the desired time.

CRISPR/Cas9-gene editing and screening
pSpCas9(gRNA)-2A-GFP containing guide RNA against (i) TIMM8A, (ii) TIMM9 or (iii)
TIMM8B were transfected into Flp-In T-REx 293 or SH-SY5Y for generation of
CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells (Ran et al., 2013). Cells were subjected to single cell sorting
for GFP positive expression prior to expansion and screening for CRISPR/Cas9 gene
editing using: (i) western blotting with antibody against specific protein; (ii) allele
sequencing to identify specific mutations introduced into the gene of interest and (iii)
complementation of CRISPR/Cas9-edited cell line with wild type protein to ensure no
off-target effects.

Mitochondrial isolation and cell lysate preparation
Mitochondria were purified from tissue culture cells using differential centrifugation as
previously described (Johnston et al., 2002; Kang et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2017). Cell
pellets were homogenised in isolation buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 220 mM
mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 1mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2 mg/ml BSA) before
centrifugation at 800 g to isolate cellular and nuclear debris. The supernatant was
centrifuged at 12,000 g to obtain the mitochondria pellet. For preparation of whole cell
lysate, cells were isolated and washed once in PBS prior to cell lysis in RIPA buffer
(150 mM NaCl, 1 % Triton-X100, 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 % SDS, 50 mM TrisCl, pH 8.0). Protein concentrations were quantified using PierceTM BCA protein assay
kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and desired amount of protein was TCA precipitated for
SDS-PAGE analysis.

Gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis
Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE was carried out as described previously (Kang et al., 2016;
Kang et al., 2017; Schagger and von Jagow, 1987). A 10-16% gradient was created
using a gradient mixer. 16% and 10% acrylamide solutions (49.5% acrylamide: 1.5%
bisacrylamide) were made up in tricine gel buffer (1 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.45, 0.1% [w/v]
SDS) with 13% [v/v] glycerol added to the 16% mix. A stacking gel (4% acrylamide in
tricine gel buffer) was overlayed onto the polymerised 10-16% gradient gel. Samples
to be analysed were made up in SDS-PAGE loading dye (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100
mM dithiothreitol, 2% [w/v] sodium dodecyl sulphate, 10% [w/v] glycerol, 0.1% [w/v]
bromophenol blue). Electrophoresis was performed using Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE
cathode buffer (0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M Tricine, pH 8.45, 0.1% SDS) and anode buffer (0.2
M Tris-Cl, pH 8.9).

Blue-Native-PAGE was performed as previously described (Ryan et al., 2001;
Schagger, 1995). 4-16% or 4-13% gradient gels were typically utilised. Acrylamide
solution (49.5% acrylamide: 1.5% bisacrylamide) consisting of 13% [v/v] glycerol in BN
gel buffer (66 mM α-amino n-caproic acid, 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7.0) was used to
generate a gradient gel, which was polymerised using TEMED and APS. A 4% [v/v]
acrylamide solution in BN gel buffer was overlayed onto the gradient gel. Samples
were solubilised in solubilisation buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM
EDTA and 10% [v/v] glycerol) with 1% [w/v] digitonin and incubated on ice for 30 min.
1:10 volume of 10X BN loading dye (5% [w/v] Coomassie blue G250 (MP Biomedicals,
LLC), 500 mM α-amino n-caproic acid, 100 mM Bis-Tris pH 7.0) was added to the
clarified supernatant prior to loading. Electrophoresis was carried out using BN
cathode buffer (50 mM tricine, 15 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 0.02% [w/v] Coomassie blue G
250) and anode buffer (50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7.0).

Following electrophoresis, gels were transferred onto 0.45 μm PVDF membranes
using a semidry transfer apparatus before being subjected to immunoblot analysis

using specific primary antibodies and secondary antibodies (Sigma). Protein detection
was performed using ECL chemiluminescent reagent (GE Healthcare) on the
ChemiDocTM MP imaging machine (BioRad). Quantification of western blot signal was
performed following the manufacturer’s instructions using the Image Lab software
(BioRad). Details of primary antibodies used for western blotting analyses are
described in the resource table.

Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation
Mitochondria were resuspended in import buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 250
mM sucrose, 5 mM magnesium acetate and 80 mM magnesium acetate)
supplemented with 0.5 mM ATP at 1 mg/ml and incubated with the amino-group
specific homobifunctional and cleavable cross-linker, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate)
(0.2 mM) (DSP; Thermo Fisher Scientific) end-over-end for 1 hr at 4 °C. The reaction
was quenched with 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 for 30 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C and solubilised in lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1% [w/v] SDS) with boiling at 95 °C for 5 min.
Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 5 min at RT before being
diluted in 1% TritonX-100-containing buffer (1% [v/v] TritonX-100, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH
7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 X complete protease inhibitor (Roche)). The sample was added
to pre-equilibrated FLAG-resin and incubated end-over-end for 1 hr at 4 °C. The resin
was isolated by centrifuging at 2,400 g for 3 min at 4 °C and unbound proteins were
isolated. The resin and bound proteins were washed X4 in 1% TritonX-100 buffer
before resuspending into 2X loading dye for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses.

In vitro protein import and autoradiography
In vitro mRNA transcription and protein translation was performed using mMessage
SP6 transcription kit (Ambion) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega)
respectively. In vitro translation was performed in the presence of

35

S-methionine.

Mitochondrial in vitro protein import assays were performed as described (Ryan et al.,

2001). Radiolabeled proteins were incubated with isolated mitochondria resuspended
at 1mg/ml in import buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM
magnesium acetate and 80 mM magnesium acetate) supplemented with 10 mM
sodium succinate, 1 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol and 5 mM ATP. Protein import was
performed at 37 °C for the desired amount of time in the presence or absence of
membrane potential. To dissipate the membrane potential, a final concentration of 10
μM of Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; Sigma-Aldrich)
was added to each import reaction. Import reaction was stopped at 4°C followed by
incubation with 50 μg/ml of PK and subsequent treatment with 1 mM PMSF.
Mitochondria were re-isolated and TCA precipitated for SDS-PAGE analysis or
resuspended into digitonin-containing buffer for BN-PAGE analysis. Autoradiography
was performed to visualise the radioactive signal using a Typhoon Phosphor Imager
(GE Healthcare). Radioactive images were processed using Image J software.

Quantitative mass spectrometry and data analysis
For mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, isolated mitochondrial protein pellet (200 μg)
was solubilised in sodium deoxycholate (SDC) containing buffer (1% (w/v) SDC; 100
mM Tris-Cl, pH8.1; 40 mM chloroacetamide, 10 mM Tris(2-carboxyethy)phosphine
(TCEP) followed by boiling at 99 °C for 15 min and sonication (Powersonic 603
Ultrasonic Cleaner, 40 KHz on high power) for 10 min at RT. Overnight digestion with
1:100 [w/w] of trypsin was performed at 37 °C. Samples were incubated with another
1:200 [w/w] trypsin for an additional 2 hours and tryptic peptides were extracted using
100 μl of ethyl acetate, 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and the entire volume was loaded
onto 3MTMEmporeTM SDB-RPS stage tips (Kulak et al., 2014). The stage tips were
washed twice using 200 μl of ethyl acetate, 1 % TFA followed by two washes with 200
μl of 0.2 % TFA. Peptides were eluted with 100 μl 80% acetonitrile, 5% ammonium
hydroxide. All spins were performed at 1,500 x g at RT. Eluates were dried using a
SpeedVac concentrator and peptides reconstituted in 15 μl of 2% acetonitrile (ACN),

0.1% TFA with sonication as above for 10 min. Samples were clarified at 16,000 g for
5 min at RT and soluble peptides transferred to autosampler vials.

Peptides were analysed by online nano-HPLC/electrospray ionization-MS/MS on Q
Exactive Plus instruments connected to an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo-Fisher
Scientific). For cell lines generated in the HEK293T background, peptides were loaded
onto a trap column (Acclaim C18 PepMap nano Trap x 2 cm, 100 μm I.D, 5 μm particle
size and 300 Å pore size; ThermoFisher Scientific) at 15 μL/min for 3 min before
switching the pre-column in line with the analytical column (Acclaim RSLC C18
PepMap Acclaim RSLC nanocolumn 75 μm x 50 cm, PepMap100 C18, 3 μm particle
size 100 Å pore size; ThermoFisher Scientific). The separation of peptides was
performed at 250 nL/min using a 128 min non-linear ACN gradient of buffer A [0.1%
(v/v) formic acid, 2% (v/v) ACN] and buffer B [0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 80% (v/v) ACN].
Data were collected in positive mode using Data Dependent Acquisition using m/z 375
– 1575 as MS scan range, HCD for MS/MS of the 12 most intense ions with z ≥ 2.
Other instrument parameters were: MS1 scan at 70,000 resolution (at 200 m/z), MS
maximum injection time 54 ms, AGC target 3E6, Normalized collision energy was at
27% energy, Isolation window of 1.8 m/z, MS/MS resolution 17,500, MS/MS AGC
target of 2E5, MS/MS maximum injection time 100 ms, minimum intensity was set at
2E3 and dynamic exclusion was set to 15 sec. For the cell line generated in the SHSH5Y background, peptides were loaded onto a trap column (PepMap C18 trap
column 75 µm x 2 cm, 3 µm, particle size, 100 Å pore size; ThermoFisher Scientific)
at 5 μL/min for 3 min before switching the pre-column in line with the analytical column
(PepMap C18 analytical column 75 μm x 50 cm, 2 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size;

Raw files were analysed using the MaxQuant platform (Tyanova et al., 2016a) version
1.6.1.0 searching against the Uniprot human database containing reviewed, canonical
and isoform variants in FASTA format (May 2016) and a database containing common
contaminants. Default search parameters for a label-free (LFQ) experiment were used
with modifications. Briefly, “Match between runs” were enabled with default settings
however .raw files from the two different instruments were given fraction numbers of 1
and 3 respectively to avoid spurious matching of MS1 peaks. Only unique peptides
were used for quantification, using a LFQ minimum ratio count of 2. Using the Perseus
platform (Tyanova et al., 2016b) version 1.6.1.1, proteins group LFQ intensities were
Log2 transformed. Values listed as being ‘Only identified by site’, ‘Reverse’ or
‘Contaminants’ were removed from the dataset, as were identifications from <2 unique
peptides. Annotations were imported from the IMPI Mitochondrial Proteome database
(http://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/impi) and ‘known mitochondrial’ proteins used for
normalization of columns by row cluster. Experimental groups were assigned to each
set of triplicates and a modified two-sided t-test based on permutation-based FDR
statistics (Tyanova et al., 2016b) was performed. The negative logarithmic p-values
were plotted against the differences between the Log2 means for the two groups. A
significance threshold (FDR < 0.05, s0 = 0.5) was used for all experiments. Profile plots
were generated as per Lake et al. (2017) (Lake et al., 2017). Briefly, mean and
standard deviations were calculated for each experimental group in Perseus. Values
from a group with a standard deviation > 0.3 were invalidated by conversion to “NaN”
and rows were filtered to contain at least 2 valid values in both experimental groups.
Tables were imported into Prism 7 software, following which a two-tailed ratio paired t-

Metabolite extraction and GC-MS analysis
For steady-state metabolomics, cells were washed using phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and frozen in liquid N2 directly in the tissue culture plate. Metabolite extraction
was performed using methanol:chloroform (9:1; [v/v]) in the presence of 0.5 nmol 13CSorbitol and 5 nmol 15C5, 15N-valine as internal standards. Cells and supernatant were
collected and centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4 °C for 5 min. Clarified supernatants were
subjected to polar metabolite derivatization and analysis using a Shimadzu GC/MSTQ8040 system (Best et al., 2018). Comprehensive targeted metabolite profiling data
was processed using Shimadzu GCMS Browser software to generate a data matrix
and was statistically analysed (Kang et al., 2017). Differences between the test and
control samples were calculated using Student’s t-test to generate p-values that were
further adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control for false-discovery
rate (BH-adjusted p-value). To identify the relative flux of substrate into cells,
glucose or

13

C6-

13

C5-glutamine labelling was performed as described (Kang et al., 2017;

Kowalski et al., 2015). Briefly, cells were grown in glucose or glutamine-free media
supplemented with 5 mM of 13C6-glucose or 4 mM 13C5-glutamine for 2 hours. Samples
were then harvested for GC/MS and statistical analyses to determine the % of
metabolite labelling as previously described. For metabolomic analyses, heatmaps
and pathway mapping were generated using publicly available analysis tools:
MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (Chong et al., 2018) or Vanted (Rohn et al., 2012).

Gene expression with quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin® RNA kit (Macherey-Negal), cDNA was
synthesised from 1 µg of RNA using High-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems) and gene expression was determined by SYBR-green RT-PCR
on the Lightcycler 480 (Roche). Gene expression was normalised to GAPDH and
analysed using the DDCt method. Primer sequences are detailed in the table below:

Cellular viability measurements
Cell viability was assessed using trypan blue staining. 6 x 105 cells were seeded and
allowed to grow at 37 °C for 24 hours. Cells were harvested and stained with 0.4%
trypan blue solution (ThermoFisher Scientific). Total number of cells and those stained
blue were scored, and the number of viable cells was calculated by subtracting bluestained (dead) cells from the total cells numbers. Conversely, % of viable cells was
determined using the following formula: 1 - (Number of blue cells/Number of total cells)
x 100%. Statistical significance of triplicate experiments was determined using twotailed Student’s t-test.

The alamarBlue® assay was carried out as previously described (Liu et al., 2015). This
assay quantifies the conversion of non-fluorescent resazurin to fluorescent by
mitochondrial metabolic activity. For these experiments, SH-SY5Y cells were seeded
in 96-well plates (1.5 x 104 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day,
these cells were treated with ferroptosis inducers: BSO (Sigma-Aldrich), Erastin or
(1S,3R)-RSL3 (SelleckChem). Following 72 hours of drug treatment (at the indicated
concentrations), 20 µL of 20% (v/v) alamarBlue® reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific)
was added to each well without removing the pre-existing media. Cells were incubated
for 2 h at 37°C, and fluorescence was measured using a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate
reader (BMG Labtech) at an excitation of 540 nm and an emission of 590 nm. The

Apoptosis Assays
Apoptotic cell death was measured using RealTime-Glo™ Annexin V Apoptosis and
Necrosis Assay (Promega), which measures phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the
outer plasma membrane as a measure of apoptosis. 4 x 104 cells were seeded onto a
96-well plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next day, cells were (i) incubated
with fresh media supplemented with or without staurosporine (1.5 μM; Sigma-Aldrich);
(ii) pretreated with or without QVD-OPh caspase inhibitor (20 μM; Sigma Aldrich) for
20 minutes before incubated with ABT737 (1 μM); (iii) incubated with fresh media
supplemented with or without menadione (10 μM; Sigma-Aldrich); or (iv) pretreated
with Vitamin C or E (0.2 mM; 0.01 mM; Sigma) for 24 hours before staurosporine
incubation. The detection reagent was added to a final concentration of 1X according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative fluorescence (necrosis) and
luminescence (apoptosis) units were measured using FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate
reader (BMG LABTECH) at the desired time interval following the different treatments.
Differences in relative luminescence and fluorescence intensity between control and
test samples were examined statistically using two-tailed Student’s t-test.

Reactive Oxygen Species Measurement
Reactive oxygen species, H2O2 were measured using ROS-Glo™ H2O2 Assay
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). 4 x 104 cells were seeded onto
a 96-well plate. Following 24 h of growth, H2O2 dilution buffer and substrate (provided
by the manufacturer; to generate luciferin precursor) with or without 10 μM menadione
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cells and was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h incubation.
ROS-Glo™ detection solution was added to the cells followed by a 20-min incubation
at RT in the dark. Luminescence signals were measured using FLUOstar OPTIMA

microplate reader (BMG LABTECH). Data generated from independent replicates of
the experiment were analysed statistically using two-tailed Student’s t-test.

Mitochondrial membrane potential measurement
Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using Tetramethylrhodamine,
methyl ester (TMRM; ThermoFisher Scientific) staining using a microplate reader.
Briefly, cells were seeded at 4 x 104 cells onto a 96-well plate and allowed to grow at
37 °C for 24 hours. Cells were treated with 75 nM TMRM stain, containing either DMSO
(untreated), 20 μM FCCP or 20 μM Oligomycin for 30 min at 37 °C prior to incubation
with the FCCP alone for another 30 min. The fluorescence signal of TMRM stain was
detected at 590 nm with an excitation at 544 nm using FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate
reader (BMG LABTECH).

Citrate Synthase Assay
To measure citrate synthase (CS) activity, cells grown in triplicate flasks were
homogenized and centrifuged at 600 g. CS activity was determined in the post-600 g
supernatants

as

described

earlier

(Frazier

and

Thorburn,

2012)

using

spectrophotometry. This assay measures the rate of free sulfhydryl group production
using the thiol reagent 5,5-ditio-bis-(2-nitronenzoic acid) which reacts with the
sulfhydryl group to form a free thionitrobenzoate anion. Briefly, CS buffer was loaded
into the cuvette (50 mM KPi, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid);
equilibrated to 30 °C) prior to the additional of the sample and Acetyl-CoA to a final
concentration of 0.1 mM. The reaction was initiated with the addition of oxaloacetic
acid (0.1 mM final concentration). Absorbance of thionitrobenzoate anion produced
was measured at 412 nm using spectrophotometer and the linear reaction rate was
obtained for about 3 mins. Spectrophotometric trace was then analysed and linear
regions was selected for calculating initial rates of enzyme activity in nmol/min/mg
protein.
