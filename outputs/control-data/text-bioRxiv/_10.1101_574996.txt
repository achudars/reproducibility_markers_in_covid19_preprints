Abstract

32

Secretion of specific proteins contributes to pathogenesis and immune responses in tuberculosis and

33

other bacterial infections, yet the kinetics of protein secretion and fate of secreted proteins in vivo are

34

poorly understood.

35

secreted protein, Ag85B, and used them to establish and characterize a sensitive ELISA to quantitate

36

Ag85B in samples generated in vitro and in vivo. We found that nutritional or culture conditions had

37

little impact on secretion of Ag85B, and that there is considerable variation in Ag85B secretion by

38

distinct strains in the M. tuberculosis complex: compared with the commonly-used H37Rv strain

39

(Lineage 4), M. africanum (Lineage 6) secretes less, and two strains from Lineage 2 secrete more

40

Ag85B. We also used the ELISA to determine that the rate of secretion of Ag85B is 10- to 100-fold

41

lower than that of proteins secreted by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. ELISA

42

quantitation of Ag85B in lung homogenates of M. tuberculosis H37Rv-infected mice revealed that

43

although Ag85B accumulates in the lungs as the bacterial population expands, the amount of Ag85B

44

per bacterium decreases nearly 10,000-fold at later stages of infection, coincident with development of

45

T cell responses and arrest of bacterial population growth. These results indicate that bacterial protein

46

secretion in vivo is dynamic and regulated, and quantitation of secreted bacterial proteins can

47

contribute to understanding pathogenesis and immunity in tuberculosis and other infections.

48

Importance

49

Bacterial protein secretion contributes to host-pathogen interactions, yet the process and

50

consequences of bacterial protein secretion during infection are poorly understood. We developed a

51

sensitive ELISA to quantitate a protein (termed Ag85B) secreted by M. tuberculosis and used it to find

52

that Ag85B secretion occurs with slower kinetics than for proteins secreted by gram positive and gram

53

negative bacteria, and that accumulation of Ag85B in the lungs is markedly regulated as a function of

54

the bacterial population density. Our results demonstrate that quantitation of bacterial proteins during

55

infection can reveal novel insights into host-pathogen interactions.

We generated new monoclonal antibodies that recognize the M. tuberculosis

Introduction

58

Mycobacterium tuberculosis employs secretion of specific proteins (estimated to include up to

59

~25% of the bacterial proteome (1)) to survive, interact with host targets during infection (2, 3),

60

manipulate its intracellular niche (2-7), and induce protective and pathogenic immune

61

responses (8). Among the proteins that are most abundant in M. tuberculosis culture

62

supernatants are members of a family of three closely related proteins, the antigen 85 (Ag85)

63

complex consisting of Ag85A, Ag85B, and Ag85C (9). All three of these proteins exhibit

64

enzymatic activity as mycolyl transferases, in which they catalyze transesterification reactions

65

to synthesize trehalose monomycolate (TMM), trehalose dimycolate (TDM), and mycolated

66

arabinogalactan (10, 11). Because of these enzymatic activities and their importance in

67

constructing the mycobacterial envelope, Ag85A, Ag85B, and Ag85C have been considered

68

potential drug targets for treatment of tuberculosis (10).

69

Due to their ability to induce adaptive CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte responses in a broad range

70

of vertebrate hosts, Ag85A and Ag85B have been investigated as antigens for tuberculosis

71

vaccines, and are prominent components of at least seven candidate vaccines in various

72

stages of development (http://www.aeras.org). Quantitative assays of mRNA have revealed

73

that the genes encoding Ag85A and Ag85B (fbpA and fbpB, respectively) are expressed at

74

high levels by bacteria in the lungs early after aerosol infection of mice, but their mRNA

75

expression decreases markedly after the recruitment of antigen-specific effector T cells to the

76

lungs (12-14). Consistent with the results of bacterial RNA quantitation, CD4 T cells specific for

77

Ag85B are activated in the lungs between two and three weeks after infection of mice, but their

78

activation markedly decreases concurrent with decreased bacterial expression of the fbpB

79

gene (12, 15).

80

Despite considerable knowledge of the properties of the fbpA and fbpB genes and the

81

antigenicity of their products, there is less information on the secretion, in vivo expression, and

82

trafficking of the Ag85A or Ag85B proteins. Because of interest in Ag85B as a vaccine and/or

83

diagnostic antigen, we generated new monoclonal antibodies to Ag85B and used them to

84

establish a highly sensitive and specific ELISA. We then employed the ELISA in studies of

85

secretion and trafficking of the Ag85B protein in vitro and in vivo.

Results

88

Generation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to Ag85B

89

Monoclonal antibodies were generated using standard methods (16), from mice immunized

90

with purified recombinant M. tuberculosis Ag85B (rAg85B), expressed in E. coli. Three

91

monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), termed 710, 711, and 712, were selected for characterization.

92

When examined by direct ELISA using wells coated with purified rAg85A, rAg85B, or rAg85C,

93

and varying concentrations of antibody, all three mAbs recognized Ag85B, and yielded

94

equivalent signals (Figure 1A). The three mAbs also recognized Ag85A in the direct ELISA,

95

although recognition of Ag85A required higher antibody concentrations and reached lower

96

maximum signal intensity than with Ag85B. mAb 710 generated a higher signal intensity, and

97

at lower antibody concentrations compared with mAbs 711 and 712; the latter two mAbs also

98

exhibited detectable binding to Ag85A when used at concentrations ≥ 1 µg/ml (Figure 1B). In

99

contrast, mAbs 711 and 712 did not bind to Ag85C in direct ELISA at any antibody

100

concentration examined, while mAb 710 bound Ag85C at antibody concentrations as low as

101

0.01 µg/ml (Figure 1C). Testing of the mAbs at a fixed concentration of 1 µg/ml on a dilution

102

series of recombinant protein in direct ELISA, revealed that mAb 710 bound to Ag85A, Ag85B,

103

and Ag85C at lower antigen concentrations than did mAb 711 or 712; mAbs 711 and 712 were

104

indistinguishable in this assay.

105

concentrations than required for binding to Ag85A or Ag85C (Figure 1D-E). Together, these

106

results indicate that mAbs 710, 711, and 712 preferentially recognize Ag85B, although each of

107

the mAbs also binds Ag85A and Ab85C when these antigens are present at high

108

concentrations.

112

highest sensitivity for detection of Ag85B was obtained when mAb 710 was used as the

113

capture antibody (Figure 2A). Although the differences were slight, sensitivity appeared to be

114

greater when mAb 711 rather than mAb 712 was used as the detecting antibody. Compared

115

with Ag85B capture by mAb 710, mAb 711 capture allowed detection of bound Ag85B by mAb

116

710 but not by mAb 712. When mAb 712 was used for capture, mAb 710 was able to bind

117

Ag85B, but mAb 711 was not. Together, these data indicate that the epitopes recognized by

118

mAbs 711 and 712 overlap or may even be identical, while the epitope recognized by mAb710

119

is distinct from those of mAbs 711 and 712. Despite detectable binding of all three mAbs to

120

Ag85A in the direct ELISA (Figure 1B), none of the combinations of capture or detecting

121

antibodies yielded a signal when Ag85A was used as the antigen in the sandwich ELISA

122

(Figure 2B). Likewise, despite binding of mAb 710 to Ag85C by direct ELISA, none of the

123

capture or detecting antibody combinations resulted in a detectable signal in the sandwich

124

ELISA when Ag85C was used as the antigen (Figure 2C). Together, these results suggest that

125

the epitope recognized by mAb 710 is at least partially shared by Ag85A, Ag85B, and Ag85C,

126

while the epitope(s) recognized by mAbs 711 and 712 is more specific to Ag85B.

127

To confirm specificity of the ELISA with the combination of mAbs 710 and 711 using native M.

128

tuberculosis proteins, we examined culture filtrates of wild-type H37Rv and of our previously-

129

characterized Ag85B-deficient (fbpB null) mutant strain of H37Rv (12). This yielded no

130

detectable signal in the ELISA when culture filtrates of the Ag85B-deficient bacteria were

131

examined, despite the detection of an abundant signal when wild-type culture filtrates were

132

examined (Figure 2D). Since the Ag85B-null bacteria retain the capacity to synthesize and

133

secrete Ag85A and Ag85C (17), these results provide further evidence that the sandwich

134

ELISA with mAbs 710 and 711 is highly specific for Ag85B.

135

The assay in this form, with mAb 710 as the capture antibody and HRP-coupled mAb 711 as

136

the detection antibody, has been run in our laboratory >30 times to determine Ag85B content

137

in various samples. Each assay comprised at least one standard curve with rAg85B per ELISA

138

plate, starting at 10 ng/ml or above and including 2-fold dilutions to loss of signal (generally,

139

≤20 pg/ml). Three representative assay standard curves are shown in Figure 2E. Ag85B in

140

samples was quantitated based on either a dose-response sigmoidal regression curve or a

141

linear regression in the linear proportion of the curve (0 ng/ml – 2.5 ng/ml). With both methods

142

regression curves had R2 values > 0.99. When necessary, samples were diluted for ELISA to

143

be in linear range of the standard curve and either at least two technical replicates or biological

144

replicates (when available) were run.

145

Carbon source effects, strain-dependent variation, and kinetics of Ag85B secretion

146

We used the ELISA to examine whether Ag85B secretion is governed by bacterial growth

147

conditions. When grown in rich broth (Middlebrook 7H9 medium with 10% albumin-dextrose-

148

catalase), a 10-fold difference in Tween 80 concentration (0.5% vs 0.05%) did not affect the

149

amount of Ag85B secreted by M. tuberculosis H37Rv in over a 24 h period (Figure 3A). When

150

H37Rv was grown in minimal defined media (Sauton's medium, with 0.05% Tween 80, 0.5%

151

BSA with 0.05% tyloxapol), or 7H9 broth with the addition of 0.2% acetate, dextrose or glycerol

152

as carbon sources, the addition of acetate or glycerol did not alter Ag85B secretion, whereas

153

0.2% dextrose increased Ag85B secretion approximately 2-fold (Figure 3A). These results

154

indicate that bacterial metabolism as dictated by alternative carbon sources can affect the rate

155

and/or amount of Ag85B secretion, but that the concentration of Tween 80 had little

156

measurable effect.

157

We previously reported that M. africanum expresses lower levels of Ag85B than M.

158

tuberculosis H37Rv, as detected by immunoblotting and by the magnitude of in vivo antigen-

159

specific CD4 T cell responses (18). To verify this result and determine whether other strain-

160

dependent variation in Ag85B secretion exists, we used the Ag85B-specific ELISA to assay

161

culture filtrates from phylogenetically distinct bacterial isolates. This confirmed that M.

162

africanum secretes significantly lower quantities of Ag85B compared with M. tuberculosis

163

H37Rv (Figure 3B). We also found that two distinct isolates of M. tuberculosis from Lineage 2

164

(includes the Beijing family) secrete significantly higher quantities of Ag85B than H37Rv

165

(Figure 3B). These results indicate substantial variation in secretion of Ag85B, according to the

166

bacterial strain, possibly in a lineage-dependent manner.

167

To further characterize the properties of Ag85B, we determined the kinetics of its secretion by

168

M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Washed mid-log phase bacteria were suspended in fresh 7H9 media

169

at 108 CFU/ml, and culture filtrates were harvested at multiple intervals and assayed by ELISA.

170

The rate of accumulation of Ag85B in culture filtrates was linear (r2 = 0.93) during the 24-hour

171

period of sampling, at 1.8 ± 0.2 ng/ml/hr (Figure 3C). Since the mature Ag85B protein has a

172

molecular weight of 34,580, this is equivalent to 52 fmol per 108 CFU/hr, or approximately 300

173

molecules secreted per bacterial cell/hr.

174

Cell-free Ag85B during infection in vivo and in vitro

175

Despite their biological activity and roles in pathogenesis and immune responses, little is

176

known of the in vivo fate or distribution of secreted M. tuberculosis proteins, especially during

177

infection. Therefore, we examined supernatants of lung homogenates obtained at various

178

intervals after infecting C57BL/6 mice with M. tuberculosis H37Rv by aerosol. We found that

179

Ag85B was detectable in lung homogenate supernatants in some, but not all, mice as early as

180

4-8 days post-infection, followed by a progressive increase between 14 and 21 days post-

181

infection (Figure 4A). Since the samples for assay were taken during the progressive growth

182

phase of the bacteria in the lungs, the quantity of Ag85B detected is a function of the amount

183

secreted by each bacterium and by the number of bacteria, which increases progressively until

184

approximately 21 days post-infection (19). Therefore, we normalized the concentration of

185

Ag85B in lung homogenates by the number of bacteria present in the lungs at each time point

186

sampled. This revealed a progressive decrease in the amount of Ag85B relative to the

187

bacterial population size, commencing between 8 and 11 days post infection (Figure 4B). This

188

result is consistent with results of Ag85B RNA quantitation on bacterial populations in the lungs

189

of immunocompetent mice (12-14), and with results of studies indicating that activation of

190

Ag85B-specific CD4 T cells in vivo decreases markedly after 2-3 weeks of infection, due to

191

limited availability of antigen (12, 15).

192

There are several potential sources of free Ag85B in the lungs. First is that some of the

193

bacteria may be extracellular and may secrete Ag85B directly to the intercellular spaces in

194

lung tissues. Second is that, as we have recently reported, Ag85B and other secreted

195

mycobacterial proteins can be exported from infected cells by a vesicular transport pathway

196

(20, 21). A third potential mechanism is release of Ag85B associated with bacterial membrane

197

vesicles (22) and/or exosomes shed by infected cells (23, 24). A fourth possible mechanism is

198

that Ag85B synthesized by intracellular bacteria may be released from dying infected cells. We

199

investigated the latter possibility, using bone marrow-derived dendritic cells infected with M.

200

tuberculosis H37Rv. Under conditions of the multiplicities of infection, bacterial strain, and time

201

points used, we observed a range of loss of cell viability as reflected by luminescence assay of

202

ATP in cell lysates, after harvesting conditioned medium for assay of Ag85B by ELISA. This

203

revealed a correlation between loss of cell viability and the quantity of Ag85B in conditioned

204

media (r2 = 0.5777; p < 0.0001) (Figure 5), indicating that Ag85B can be released from dead

205

and/or dying infected cells in a form that remains detectable by ELISA. This suggests that

206

death of infected cells can be a source of the Ag85B detected in cell-free homogenates of the

207

lungs of infected mice, as in Figure 4.

209

Discussion

210

In this work, we developed three new murine monoclonal antibodies by immunizing mice with

211

recombinant M. tuberculosis Ag85B, and used them to develop a sensitive and specific ELISA

212

for quantitation of Ag85B in various biological samples. We found that, compared with the

213

H37Rv strain from the M. tuberculosis complex lineage 4, two isolates from lineage 2 secreted

214

greater quantities, while a lineage 6 (M. africanum) isolate secreted lesser quantities of Ag85B.

215

Since Ag85B plays a role in synthesis of trehalose dimycolate, and trehalose dimycolate is a

216

potent proinflammatory mediator during M. tuberculosis infection (25-28), the results suggest

217

that differences in Ag85B secretion may contribute to strain-dependent differences in the

218

proinflammatory properties of distinct strains and lineages in the M. tuberculosis complex (29).

219

Strain variability in secretion may also influence the frequency and magnitude of T cell

220

responses to Ag85B, which may provide an explanation for the finding that fewer human

221

subjects exhibit detectable responses to Ag85B compared with other antigens such as ESAT-6

222

and/or CFP-10 (30, 31). Likewise, bacterial strain-dependent variation in secretion of Ag85B

223

may influence the protective efficacy of TB subunit vaccines that include Ag85B: even if a

224

vaccine generates immune responses to Ag85B, vaccination may provide little protection

225

against infection with mycobacterial strains that express and secrete lesser quantities of

226

Ag85B.

227

characterize Ag85B expression and secretion in the isolates of M. tuberculosis from subjects

228

that develop breakthrough infections despite apparently-appropriate immune responses to the

229

vaccine antigen.

230

We also used the ELISA to determine the rate of secretion by M. tuberculosis H37Rv in broth

231

culture as approximately 300 molecules of Ag85B per bacterial cell per hour. This is 10 to

232

100-fold lower than the rate of translocation of E. coli proOmpA (4.5 mol/min) (32), or the

233

secretion of Staphylococcal toxic shock toxin (1.1 x 104 molecules/CFU/hr) (33).

In studies of subunit vaccines that include Ag85B, it may be informative to

234

understand the basis for this difference will require determination of the rates of protein

235

synthesis in M. tuberculosis compared with that of other bacteria, and characterization of the

236

factors and mechanisms that determine the rate of protein secretion by distinct secretion

237

systems in bacteria. Given the important roles of secreted protein virulence factors in M.

238

tuberculosis and other bacterial pathogens, better understanding of protein secretion may

239

reveal new targets for therapeutic modulation and reduction of disease and pathogen

240

transmission.

241

A third major finding in these studies is that M. tuberculosis Ag85B can be found in

242

homogenized lung tissue supernatants from infected mice. This finding has several potential

243

implications. If data from studies in human subjects provide supportive data, then detecting

244

Ag85B in respiratory secretions may provide a rapid and economical approach to diagnosis of

245

pulmonary tuberculosis and may also be useful in monitoring responses to treatment. Another

246

is that the presence of extracellular Ag85B in lung tissue may make Ag85B available for

247

uptake and processing and presentation by uninfected dendritic cells and macrophages in the

248

lungs. Since we have reported that direct recognition of infected cells is required for optimal

249

CD4 T cell control of intracellular M. tuberculosis (34), acquisition and presentation of Ag85B

250

by uninfected cells in the lungs may provide antigen-loaded decoys for Ag85B-specific CD4 T

251

cells that reduce the frequency of recognition of infected cells by those T cells.

252

consistent with our recent finding in mouse lungs (35) and the finding in lungs of M.

253

tuberculosis-infected rhesus macaques (36) that only a small fraction of the T cells in the lungs

254

are in close contact with M. tuberculosis-infected cells. Our associated finding in this work that

255

death of M. tuberculosis-infected host cells can be associated with release of Ag85B to the

256

extracellular space indicates that the presence of Ag85B (and other mycobacterial proteins) in

257

extracellular tissue compartments in the lungs may be the consequence of secretion by

258

extracellular bacteria, vesicular transport from infected cells (21), carriage by exosomes (37,

38), and release by dying or dead host cells. Since Ag85B (39, 40), ESAT-6 (41) and other

260

mycobacterial proteins have been reported to act on host cells to modulate inflammation, our

261

findings provide additional evidence for the plausibility that extracellular mycobacterial proteins

262

contribute to the pathogenesis of TB, and may be susceptible to therapeutic modulation.

Direct ELISA for characterization of individual mAbs

287

Ag85A (BEI Resources NR-14871), Ag85B (our purified recombinant), or Ag85C (BEI

288

Resources NR-14858) were used to coat wells at 0.5 µg/well in PBS and incubated overnight

289

at 4°C. The plates were washed 3 times with PBS pH 7.4 with 0.05 % Tween 20, and blocked

290

with PBS containing 1.0 % BSA for 1 hour. A starting concentration of 5 µg/ml of mAb 710,

291

711, or 712 was serially diluted and 200 l/well incubated at room temperature for 2 hours.

292

Plates were washed 5 times and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (MP Biomedicals)

293

for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed 7 times and developed with TMB

294

substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD). The reaction was stopped with 2M

295

sulfuric acid and absorbance read at 450 nm with a Synergy H1 micro plate reader (BioTek).

296

Mycobacterial culture filtrates

297

M. tuberculosis strains H37RV, 4334, and HN878, or M. africanum strain 1182, were

298

inoculated from a 1 ml frozen stock of approximately 3x108 CFU/ml into 10 ml of Middlebrook

299

7H9 media supplemented with 0.5 % albumin, 0.2 % dextrose and 0.3 mg/100 ml catalase (in

300

the text, termed 7H9) and grown to late log phase. The cultures were then passaged and

301

grown once to mid log phase. Cultures were then collected and spun at 150 x g. The collected

302

supernatant was then spun at 3,750 x g for 5 minutes and washed with PBS. The pellets were

303

then resuspended in fresh 7H9 media and grown for 24 h. The cultures were pelleted and the

304

media was sterile filtered.

305

Sandwich ELISA development and optimization

306

Individual mAbs were used at 2.5 µg/ml in 50 µl 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer to coat

307

wells overnight at 4° C. The plates were washed 3 times with PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.5% Tween

308

309

conjugated to HRP according to manufacturer’s recommendations (Abcam). Briefly, 1 µl of

310

Modifier was mixed with 10 µl of antibody and then added to a vial of HRP Mix. The vial was

311

incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, 1 µl of Quencher was

312

added and mixed. The conjugated antibodies were diluted to 0.5 µg/ml in PBS with 1% BSA

313

and stored in aliquots at -20 °C until first use. Upon thawing, conjugated antibodies were

314

stored at 4 °C.

315

For ELISA, samples were added to plates coated with the designated antibody and incubated

316

at room temperature for 2 hours, then plates were washed 5 times. The labeled, detecting

317

antibody was added and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates

318

were washed 7 times and developed with substrate according to the manufacturers’

319

instructions (BD). The reaction was stopped with 2M sulfuric acid and absorbance read at 450

320

nm.

321

Sandwich ELISA application

322

The routine sandwich ELISA used the procedures as described above, with mAb 710 as the

323

capture antibody used to coat wells, and HRP-conjugated mAb 711 used to detect bound

324

antigen. Signal generation for the HRP reaction used TMB substrate (Thermo Scientific).

325

Effects of medium and carbon source

326

After washing in PBS, bacteria were resuspended in 6 ml of distilled water and split among 6

327

bottles. 10 ml of media was added to the bottles. The media were Middlebrook 7H9 with 10%

328

ADC and either 0.05% or 0.5% Tween 80; or Sauton’s broth with 0.05% Tween 80, 0.5% BSA,

329

and 0.05% tyloxapol, with 0.2% (w/v) acetate, glycerol, or dextrose (adapted from (45)), and

330

bacteria were incubated for 24 h prior to preparation of culture filtrates.

331

Preparation of lung homogenate supernatants from M. tuberculosis-infected mice

332

C57BL/6 mice were infected by the aerosol route with ~60 CFU/mouse of M. tuberculosis

333

H37Rv; lungs were harvested and single-cell suspensions were prepared as previously

335

aliquot of each sample was sterile-filtered, and Ag85B concentration determined by ELISA.

336

Culture, infection, and analysis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cell death and release of

337

Ag85B.

338

Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC), generated as previously described (20), were

339

seeded in 96-well tissue culture treated plates (Corning) at 2x106/well and rested for 2 hours,

340

then infected overnight with different multiplicities of infection (1, 2, 4 and 8) with M.

341

tuberculosis H37Rv, treated with Amikacin (200 g/ml, 40min) in BMDC medium (RPMI1640

342

supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1x

343

-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES and 12 ng/ml recombinant mouse GM-CSF), washed three

344

times in PBS and further cultured in fresh BMDC medium. CM was harvested 16, 24, 34 and

345

48 hours later, sterile filtered and Ag85B in CM quantified by sandwich ELISA. At each harvest

346

time point infected BMDC were assayed for cell death by CellTiter-Glo (Promega) according to

347

the manufacturer’s instructions and signal read as Luminescence with a Synergy H1 micro

348

plate reader (BioTek). For each harvest time point signal from uninfected cells was considered

349

as 100 % viability for determination of loss of viability of infected cells.

350

Statistical analyses

351

All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7 (Graphpad). The specific tests used for

352

data analysis are specified in the individual figure legends.

Figure 1. Recognition of Ag85A, Ag85B, and Ag85C by monoclonal antibodies 710, 711,

502

and 712. Panels A-C: Wells of 96-well plates were coated with Ag85B (panel A), Ag85A

503

(panel B), or Ag85C (panel C), each at 0.5 µg/ml. Monoclonal Abs 710, 711, or 712 were

504

added at the indicated concentrations, and binding was detected after washing, using

505

horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and TMB substrate. Data

506

shown in Panels A-C are representative of three independent experiments with one technical

507

replicate per experiment per condition. Panels D-F: Individual wells were coated with a dilution

508

series of Ag85B (panel D), Ag85A (panel E), or Ag85C (panel F), starting at 20 µg/ml.

509

Monoclonal Abs 710, 711, or 712 were added at a concentration of 1 µg/ml, and binding was

secretion. A) Effects of media composition and carbon source on Ag85B secretion. Mid-log

532

phase bacteria (A600 = 1.0) grown in 7H9 medium were washed 5 times, then diluted 10-fold

533

into the indicated media. After 24 h, the A600 was determined for each culture, and sterile

534

filtrates were prepared for analysis by mAb 710-711 ELISA. Results of Ag85B quantitation by

535

ELISA were normalized by the A600 of the individual culture. 7H9 0.05% T80: Middlebrook 7H9

multiple comparisons. B) Mycobacterial strain-dependent variation of Ag85B secretion. Mid-log

543

phase cultures were collected and the bacteria from each strain were washed and

544

resuspended in fresh 7H9 broth. After 24h, the bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and

545

Ag85B in culture filtrates was quantitated by ELISA. Show are mean (bar) and standard

546

deviation (error bar) of biological triplicate values. The adjusted p values shown are for

547

comparison of each strain with H37Rv, and were determined by one-way ANOVA with

Figure 5. Death of M. tuberculosis-infected primary dendritic cells releases Ag85B. Bone

561

marrow-derived dendritic cells were infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv at different

562

multiplicities of infection (1, 2, 4 and 8). At designated time points (12 h grey dots, 16 h

563

medium blue dots, 24 h red dots, 36 h light blue dots, 48h dark blue dots), medium was

564

removed for quantitation by ELISA, and dendritic cell viability was assessed by luminescence

565

assay of ATP of cell lysates. Results of the two assays on a given sample were plotted as a

566

data point, and Pearson correlation was determined for the whole dataset. Shown are

567

representative results of two similar experiments.
