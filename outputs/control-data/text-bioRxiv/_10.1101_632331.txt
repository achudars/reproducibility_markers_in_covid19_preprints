DDX28 negatively regulates HIF-2α
19

ABSTRACT

20

Hypoxia occurs when there is a deficiency in oxygen delivery to tissues and is connected to

21

physiological and pathophysiological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing,

22

heart disease and cancer. The master regulators of oxygen homeostasis in mammalian cells are

23

the heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2. The oxygen-labile

24

HIF-2α subunit has not only been implicated in transcription, but also as a regulator of eIF4E2-

25

directed hypoxic translation. Here, we have identified the DEAD-box protein family member

26

DDX28 as a novel interactor and negative regulator of HIF-2α that suppresses its ability to

27

activate eIF4E2-directed translation. We demonstrate that stable silencing of DDX28 via shRNA

28

in hypoxic human U87MG glioblastoma cells caused an increase, relative to control, to: HIF-2α

29

protein levels, the ability of eIF4E2 to bind the m7GTP cap structure, and the translation of select

30

eIF4E2 target mRNAs. DDX28 depletion elevated both nuclear and cytoplasmic HIF-2α, but

31

HIF-2α transcriptional activity did not increase possibly due to its already high nuclear

32

abundance in hypoxic control cells. Depletion of DDX28 conferred a proliferative advantage to

33

hypoxic, but not normoxic cells, which is likely a consequence of the translational upregulation

34

of a subset of hypoxia-response mRNAs. DDX28 protein levels are reduced in several cancers,

35

including glioma, relative to normal tissue. Therefore, we uncover a regulatory mechanism for

36

this potential tumor suppressor in the repression of HIF-2α- and eIF4E2-mediated translation

37

activation of oncogenic mRNAs.

DDX28 negatively regulates HIF-2α

INTRODUCTION

39

The procurement for oxygen is a fundamental aspect of survival for aerobic organisms in all

40

domains of life. Mammals have evolved complex circulatory, respiratory, and neuroendocrine

41

systems to satisfy the need for molecular oxygen as the primary electron acceptor in oxidative

42

phosphorylation, which supplies energy in the form of ATP [1]. The ability of a cell to acclimate

43

to low oxygen (hypoxia or ≤ 1% O 2 ), which usually arises due to an imbalance in supply and

44

demand, is essential from the earliest stages of life [2, 3]. Hypoxia plays a role in several

45

physiological and pathophysiological conditions such as embryonic development, muscle

46

exercise, wound healing, cancer, heart disease, and stroke [4]. Prior to the establishment of

47

uteroplacental circulation, embryonic cells receive only as much as 2% O 2 , and following

48

oxygenation by maternal blood, the embryo still contains discrete regions of hypoxia [2, 5]. This

49

form of physiological hypoxia helps govern the process of development through cell fate

50

determination, angiogenesis, placentation, cardiogenesis, bone formation, and adipogenesis [3, 6-

51

10]. Hypoxia is also a feature of the tumor microenvironment, and plays a key role in several

52

cancer hallmarks toward tumor progression [11, 12]. The major cellular response to hypoxia is

53

mediated by hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF-1 and HIF-2). The HIFs are

54

heterodimeric, composed of an oxygen-labile α-subunit, HIF-1α or HIF-2α, and a constitutively

55

expressed HIF-1β subunit [11]. HIF-1 and HIF-2 activate the transcription of hundreds of genes

56

(some shared and some unique), including those involved in metabolism and erythropoiesis, in

57

order to simultaneously reduce the activity of energy-expensive processes and promote the

58

increased uptake of nutrients and oxygen [13]. Further investigation into the unique roles of HIF-

59

1α and HIF-2α, and how they might be differentially regulated, will reveal novel insights into

60

hypoxic gene expression.

DDX28 negatively regulates HIF-2α
61

Unlike HIF-1α that is more involved in acute hypoxia (< 24 h), HIF-2α is linked to

62

chronic hypoxia [14]. Further, HIF-2α accumulates in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [15].

63

Indeed, HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α, participates in the recruitment of select hypoxia-response

64

mRNAs to the translation apparatus [16], not only in hypoxia but in the low-range of

65

physiological oxygen (< 8% O 2 ) [17]. Hypoxia is a potent inhibitor of mammalian target of

66

rapamycin complex 1, suppressing canonical cap-dependent translation by sequestering the cap-

67

binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) [18-21]. Alternative modes of translation

68

initiation are utilized during hypoxia including cap-independent mechanisms as well as non-

69

canonical cap-dependent translation mediated by the eIF4E2 cap-binding protein. HIF-2α and

70

RBM4 recognize select mRNAs by binding to RNA Hypoxia Response Elements (rHREs) in

71

their 3’ UTRs and initiating their translation via the 5’ cap through eIF4E2, eIF4G3 and eIF4A

72

[16, 22]. HIF-2α and eIF4E2 are essential for embryonic development [3, 23], and important

73

contributors to tumor progression [24, 25], both hypoxia-driven processes. The protein levels of

74

eIF4E2 do not change between normoxia and hypoxia [16, 17]. HIF-2α, on the other hand, is

75

constantly degraded in normoxia via a family of prolyl hydroxylases that are inhibited by

76

hypoxia [11]. In hypoxia, it is mostly unclear how the activities of eIF4E2 or HIF-2α are

77

regulated with respect to translation initiation. A greater understanding of these mechanisms will

78

shed light on how gene expression is coordinated in physiological and pathophysiological

79

processes that are linked to hypoxia.

80

Here we demonstrate that the DEAD box protein DDX28 is a negative regulator of HIF-

81

2α protein levels in a human glioblastoma cell line. DDX28 has been detected in mitochondria,

82

cytoplasm and nuclei [26]. However, known functions of DDX28 are limited to its RNAi-

83

mediated silencing disrupting mitoribosome assembly [27, 28], which is also an outcome of

DDX28 negatively regulates HIF-2α
84

hypoxia [29]. While it is known that hypoxia increases HIF-2α levels, our data show that DDX28

85

protein levels concurrently decrease. We also show that DDX28 interacts with HIF-2α, but not

86

HIF-1α or the m7GTP cap structure. We demonstrate a link between these two observations by

87

depleting DDX28 levels in hypoxia whereby an even greater increase to HIF-2α levels was

88

observed along with its effect on eIF4E2-dependent translation activation. Hypoxic depletion of

89

DDX28 caused eIF4E2 and its mRNA targets to associate more with the m7GTP cap structure

90

and polysomes, respectively. Furthermore, hypoxic depletion of DDX28 caused a significant

91

increase to cell proliferation only in hypoxia. While HIF-2α increased in both the nucleus and

92

cytoplasm upon DDX28 depletion, there was no increase to its transcriptional activity. We

93

propose a model where DDX28 reduction in hypoxia plays a role in HIF-2α stabilization, but

94

some DDX28 is still useful to restrain the HIF-2α/eIF4E2 translational axis, which can be

95

oncogenic [24, 25].

96

RESULTS

97

DDX28 interacts with HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α or eIF4E2

98

U87MG human glioblastoma cells were used in this study because they have previously been

99

characterized as models for hypoxia research and the interaction between HIF-2α and eIF4E2 in

100

non-canonical cap-dependent translation [16, 17, 22, 24, 25]. When U87MG were exposed to

101

hypoxia (1% O 2 ) for 24 h, we not only observed an increase in HIF-2α, but a concurrent

102

decrease in DDX28 levels (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, when DDX28 was stably depleted via two

103

independent shRNA sequences to produce two unique cell lines, the hypoxia-dependent increase

104

in HIF-2α was further increased relative to controls expressing a non-targeting shRNA (Fig. 1B).

105

We next investigated whether DDX28 was directly involved in HIF-2α regulation by performing

106

a co-immunoprecipitation. Exogenous tagged proteins were used due to the lack of specificity of

107

the antibodies for the endogenous protein or its low abundance. In hypoxic U87MG cells,

108

exogenous GFP-HIF-2α, but not GFP alone, co-immunoprecipitated with DDX28 (Fig. 1C).

109

Since HIF-2α is a known interactor of eIF4E2 at the 5’ mRNA cap in hypoxia [16], we tested

110

whether DDX28 was part of this complex. However, exogenous eIF4E2 co-immunoprecipitated

111

with HIF-2α, but not DDX28 (Fig. 1D). Further, to demonstrate specificity for the HIF-2α

112

homolog, HIF-1α did not co-immunoprecipitate with DDX28 (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that

113

DDX28 interacts with a distinct pool of HIF-2α that is not associated with eIF4E2.

114

Depletion of DDX28 enhances the association of eIF4E2 with m7GTP and polyribosomes

115

We performed m7GTP cap-binding assays to test whether the increased HIF-2α levels in DDX28

116

depleted cells had an effect on the translation initiation potential of eIF4E2. In hypoxia, eIF4E2

117

bound more to m7GTP by 1.6 ± 0.1 and 1.5 ± 0.2 fold in two DDX28 depleted cell lines relative

118

to control (Fig. 2A-B). Surprisingly, depletion of DDX28 in normoxia had an even greater effect

119

on eIF4E2 binding to m7GTP with 2.9 ± 0.4 and 2.5 ± 0.1 fold increases relative to control (Fig.

120

2C-D). These data are also in support of Fig. 1D that DDX28 does not bind the m7GTP cap.

121

m7GTP association of a cap-binding protein like eIF4E2 does not necessarily imply an

122

increase in translation initiation [30]. Therefore we performed polysome fractionation to test

123

whether eIF4E2 had a greater association with polysomes isolated from DDX28 depleted cells

124

relative to controls in normoxia and hypoxia. Using densitometry to quantify total eIF4E2

125

associated with monosomes (low translation; fractions 1-3) and polysomes (medium to high

126

translation; fractions 4-9), we show that 5 ± 1.2% of total eIF4E2 in normoxic control cells was

127

associated with polysomes (Fig. 3A). In DDX28-depleted cells, the proportion of polysome-

128

associated eIF4E2 increased to 23 ± 3.2% (Fig. 3B). Hypoxic control cells displayed 22 ± 5.1%

129

eIF4E2 associated with polysomes (Fig. 3C), an increase relative to normoxic control cells (5 ±

130

1.2%; Fig. 3A). Hypoxic DDX28-depleted cells had an even greater proportion of eIF4E2

131

associated with polysomes (41 ± 4.1%) relative to hypoxic control cells (Fig. 3D). The polysome

132

association of the canonical cap-binding protein eIF4E did not change in any condition (Fig. 3E).

133

Our data show that hypoxia, or knockdown of DDX28 in normoxia, increased the proportion of

134

polysome-associated eIF4E2 relative to normoxic control cells (Fig. 3F). However, DDX28

135

depletion and hypoxia together significantly increased the polysome association of eIF4E2

136

relative to normoxic control cells (Fig. 3F).

137

Depletion of DDX28 increases the translation of eIF4E2 target transcripts in hypoxia

138

We performed qRT-PCR on monosome and polysome fractions in normoxia and hypoxia to

139

measure the DDX28-dependent association of eIF4E2 and eIF4E target transcripts. We chose

140

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R)

141

mRNAs, previously characterized as eIF4E2-dependent transcripts due to the presence of an

142

rHRE in their 3’ UTR [16, 17], and Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factor 2 (EEF2) and Heat

143

Shock Protein 90 Alpha Family Class B Member 1 (HSP90ab1) mRNAs previously

144

characterized as eIF4E-dependent transcripts due to the presence of a 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine

145

motif [17, 31]. We observed a significant increase in the association of EGFR mRNA with

146

polysomes relative to monosomes from 4.5 ± 0.9-fold in controls to 11.3 ± 1.6-fold in DDX28

147

depleted cells in hypoxia (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the polysome association of IGF1R mRNA

148

significantly increased from 3.2 ± 0.3 in controls to 5.4 ± 0.7 in DDX28-depleted cells in

149

hypoxia (Fig. 4A). In normoxia, there was no difference in the polysome-association of EGFR

150

mRNA relative to monosomes between controls (3.5 ± 0.5-fold) and DDX28 depleted cells (3.8

151

± 0.5-fold) (Fig. 4B). Similarly, there was no statistical difference in the polysome-association of

152

IGF1R mRNA relative to monosomes between controls (5.6 ± 0.8-fold) and DDX28 depleted

153

cells (3.5 ± 0.5-fold) (Fig. 4B). Moreover, EGFR protein levels (Fig. 4C), but not total EGFR

154

mRNA levels (Fig. 4D), increased in hypoxic DDX28-depleted cells relative to control. Neither

155

of the eIF4E-dependent transcripts displayed significant changes in polysome-association in

156

normoxia or hypoxia between DDX28-depleted and controls. The one exception was EEF2

157

mRNA, which displayed a small significant increase in normoxic polysome-association relative

158

to monosomes in DDX28-depleted cells (1.52 ± 0.04) compared to controls (1.05 ± 0.06) (Fig.

159

4E). These data suggest that DDX28 depletion significantly increases the translation of eIF4E2-

160

dependent, but not eIF4E-dependent, transcripts in hypoxia.

161

Depletion of DDX28 in hypoxia increases cytoplasmic and nuclear HIF-2α levels, but not its

162

nuclear activity

163

Hypoxic cells were fractionated into cytoplasm and nuclei to measure the effects of DDX28

164

depletion on HIF-2α levels in both compartments. In accordance with the abovementioned

165

observations that DDX28 depletion increases total HIF-2α protein levels and its cytoplasmic

166

activity (translation), we show that DDX28 depletion increased cytoplasmic HIF-2α levels

167

compared to control (Fig. 5A). However, we also observed an increase in the nuclear levels of

168

HIF-2α. Therefore, we investigated whether DDX28 depletion in hypoxia also increased the

169

nuclear activity of HIF-2α (transcription) by measuring the mRNA abundance from its gene

170

targets relative to control. We chose six genes that contain Hypoxia Response Elements in their

171

promoters that are more dependent on HIF-2α than HIF-1α [32-35]. None of the six genes

172

displayed a significant increase in mRNA abundance in DDX28 depleted cells relative to control

173

(Fig. 5B). In fact, two genes displayed significant decreases in mRNA abundance, albeit by two-

174

fold at most. These data suggest that while both nuclear and cytoplasmic HIF-2α levels increase

175

in response to DDX28 depletion, the effect on HIF-2α transcriptional activity is minimal.

DDX28 negatively regulates HIF-2α
176

DDX28 depletion causes an increase in cell viability and proliferation in hypoxia but not

177

normoxia

178

We next investigated whether the increase in eIF4E2-directed translation in DDX28 depleted

179

cells provided a benefit to cells by measuring their viability and proliferation in normoxia and

180

hypoxia. To assess this, we monitored the number of viable DDX28 depleted and control cells

181

over 72 h at 24 h intervals using crystal violet staining. We observed no significant differences in

182

viability at 24, 48, or 72 h between normoxic DDX28 depleted and control cells (Fig. 6A).

183

However, both hypoxic DDX28 depleted cell lines had significantly increased viability

184

compared to control at each time interval (Fig. 6B). To measure proliferation, we monitored the

185

incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the DNA of actively dividing cells via

186

immunofluorescence. In normoxia, one DDX28 depleted cell line displayed a significant

187

increase in BrdU incorporation relative to control (Fig. 6C). However, following 24 h of

188

hypoxia, both DDX28 depleted cell lines displayed significant increases in BrdU incorporation

189

relative to control (Fig. 6D). To test whether overexpressing exogenous DDX28 would have the

190

opposite effect (decreased viability, proliferation, and HIF-2α levels) in hypoxia, we generated

191

two stable clonal U87MG cell lines expressing FLAG-DDX28 and a control expressing FLAG

192

alone. We did not observe any significant differences in viability, proliferation, or HIF-2α levels

193

between the overexpressing cell lines relative to the control (Fig. S1A-E). The one exception was

194

a decrease in viability after 24 h of hypoxia in one of the overexpressing cell lines relative to

195

control, but this difference ceased at 48 h and 72 h. Since hypoxia appears to reduce the levels of

196

exogenous DDX28 (Fig. S1E), it is possible that the overexpressing cell lines do not overexpress

197

DDX28 enough in hypoxia to suppress HIF-2α or that DDX28 is already suprastoichiometric to

198

HIF-2α. Our data suggest that depletion of DDX28 provides an increase to cell viability and

200

other unidentified pathways.

201

DISCUSSION

202

HIF-2α and eIF4E2 contribute to the ability of a cell to adapt to hypoxic conditions through

203

selective gene expression by transcriptional and translation regulation. We have previously

204

shown that eIF4E2 knockdown represses hypoxic cell proliferation and survival, migration and

205

invasion, and tumor growth [24, 25]. Furthermore, eIF4E2-directed translation is active in the

206

low range of physiological oxygen where HIF-2α, but not yet HIF-1α, is stabilized (3-8% O 2 )

207

[17]. Total levels of eIF4E2 protein are minimally altered upon hypoxic exposure [16, 17, 25,

208

36], so how is it regulated? Post-translational modifications of eIF4E2 have been identified such

209

as ISGylation [37], as well as protein interactors such as eIF4G3 and eIF4A [16, 22]. However,

210

the stabilization of HIF-2α is essential for eIF4E2 hypoxic activity [16] and is likely a more

211

upstream regulatory step for eIF4E2-directed translation to be functional.

212

We have uncovered a new mode of HIF-2α regulation that affects the activity of hypoxic

213

translation via eIF4E2. HIF-2α co-immunoprecipitated with DDX28 and eIF4E2 (Fig. 4C), but

214

eIF4E2 did not co-immunoprecipitate with DDX28 (Fig. 4D). This suggests that DDX28

215

interacts with a different pool of HIF-2α than the one that interacts with eIF4E2. In agreement,

216

DDX28 did not interact with the m7GTP cap structure (Fig. 2). However, the depletion of

217

DDX28 did significantly increase the ability of eIF4E2 to associate with m7GTP, suggesting that

218

its effect on HIF-2α influences eIF4E2 activity. Indeed, eIF4E2 did associate more with

219

polysomes upon DDX28 depletion (Fig. 3F). Mechanisms were initially proposed where HIF-2α

220

acted at the 3’ UTR rHRE of select mRNAs along with RBM4 to mediate joining of the 5’ end

221

and eIF4E2 [16, 22, 38]. It is important to note that cap-binding assays are performed with

DDX28 negatively regulates HIF-2α
222

m7GTP bound to agarose beads and not to an mRNA [39]. Therefore, these data suggest that

223

HIF-2α could act directly on eIF4E2 to regulate its cap-binding potential (Fig. 7).

224

While depletion of DDX28 significantly increased the ability of eIF4E2 to bind m7GTP

225

in both normoxia and hypoxia, it was surprising that this increase was greater in normoxia than

226

in hypoxia (Fig. 2). This could indicate that DDX28 has increased relevance as a suppressor of

227

eIF4E2 activity in normoxia, but while the polysome-associated eIF4E2 increased in DDX28

228

depleted normoxic cells, it was not statistically significant (Fig. 3F). Further, the polysome

229

association of eIF4E2 mRNA targets EGFR and IGF1R did not increase in normoxic DDX28

230

depleted cells relative to control (Fig. 4B). In hypoxia, the effects of DDX28 depletion were not

231

only observed on eIF4E2 m7GTP and polysome association, but here EGFR and IGF1R mRNAs

232

were significantly more associated with polysomes relative to control (Fig. 4A). We speculate

233

that depleting DDX28 in normoxia may increase the very low levels of HIF-2α to levels still

234

undetectable via western blot, but enough to significantly increase the cap-binding potential of

235

eIF4E2. The relative increase in HIF-2α in normoxic DDX28 depleted cells relative to control

236

may be greater than that in hypoxic cells, but there could be an unmet requirement in normoxia

237

for a threshold amount of total HIF-2α protein to efficiently activate eIF4E2 and the translation

238

of its mRNA targets. Unexpectedly, the increase in nuclear HIF-2α upon DDX28 depletion in

239

hypoxia did not produce subsequent increases to the transcription of its target genes (Fig. 5). We

240

speculate that perhaps in hypoxic control cells, the HIF-2α DNA binding sites are saturated.

241

Conversely, the cytoplasmic HIF-2α targets (i.e. eIF4E2, DDX28) are likely not saturated due to

242

the much lower levels of HIF-2α in this compartment relative to the nucleus.

243

Hypoxia decreases total DDX28 protein levels, but our data suggest that the remaining

244

DDX28 is important to restrain the HIF-2α/eIF4E2 translational axis. This brings into to question

DDX28 negatively regulates HIF-2α
245

why a negative regulator of this pathway would be in place, given that the expression of rHRE-

246

containing mRNAs contributes to hypoxic survival [25]. Dozens of eIF4E2 mRNA targets have

247

been identified such as EGFR, IGF1R, PDGFRA, CDH22 [16, 17, 22, 24], and these have all

248

been characterized as oncogenes [24, 40, 41]. Therefore, while important for hypoxic adaptation,

249

tight regulation of this pathway is likely required to prevent neoplastic transformation. Indeed,

250

mining the data in The Pathology Atlas within The Human Protein Atlas, we found that DDX28

251

is present in most tissues, but lost in the majority of cancers (n ≥ 3 patients per cancer type;

252

available from v18.proteinatlas.org and https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000182810-

253

DDX28/pathology) [42]. Conversely, the presence of DDX28 is listed as a favorable prognostic

254

marker in cases of renal cell carcinoma. More than 80% of all clear cell renal cell carcinomas

255

(CCRCC), the most common form of renal cancer, contain inactivating mutations in the VHL

256

gene that stabilize the HIF-α subunits in a hypoxia-independent manner [43]. The normoxic

257

stabilization of HIF-2α and activation of its oncogenic pathways that occurs in CCRCC could be

258

antagonized by the presence of DDX28. This study was performed in U87MG glioblastoma

259

cells, but since DDX28 appears to be expressed ubiquitously, it could function similarly in other

260

tissues. We provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of HIF-2α and eIF4E2-directed

261

hypoxic translation, and support for DDX28 as a tumor suppressor and prognostic marker to

262

deepen our understanding of cancer progression.

263

METHODS

264

Cell Culture

265

U87MG human glioblastoma cells (HTB-14) were obtained from the American Type Culture

266

Collection and maintained as suggested. Normoxic cells were maintained at 37 °C in ambient O2

267

levels (21%) and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Hypoxia was induced by culturing at 1% O2

HypOxystation.

270

Generation of Stable Cell Lines

271

Two unique OmicsLink™ shRNA expression vectors (Genecopoeia) were used to target the

272

coding sequence of human DDX28 [HSH014712-3-nU6 sequence 5’-ggtggactacatcttagag-3’,

273

HSH014712-3-nU6 sequence 5’-acgctgcaagattacatcc-3’]. A non-targeting shRNA was used as a

274

control. U87MG cells stably expressing C-terminal 3x FLAG tagged DDX28 were generated by

275

transfecting cells with the OmicsLink™ pEZ-M14 EX-A3144-M14 expression vector encoding

276

the human DDX28 coding sequence (Genecopoeia). Selection was initiated 48 h post-

277

transfection using 1 μg/mL puromycin or 400 μg/mL G418, respectively, and single colonies

278

were picked after seven days.

279

Western Blot analysis

280

Standard western blot protocols were used. Primary antibodies: anti-eIF4E2 (Genetex,

281

GTX82524), anti-DDX28 (Abcam, ab70821), anti-eIF4E (Cell Signaling, C46H6) anti-GAPDH

282

(Cell Signaling, D16H11), anti-RPL5 (Abcam, ab137617), anti-HIF-2α (Novus, NB100-122),

283

anti-FLAG (Sigma, F1804), anti-α-tubulin (GeneTex, GT114), anti-lamin a/c (Cell Signaling,

284

2032), anti-GFP (Abcam, ab290), anti-HA (Santa Cruz, Y-11), anti-β-Actin (Genetex, GT5512),

285

and anti-EGFR (Proteintech, 18986-1-AP).

286

Polysome Profiling and analysis

287

Performed as described previously [17]. The total eIF4E2 or eIF4E signal was quantified by

288

densitometry using Bio-Rad Image Lab software, and the percentage of eIF4E2 or eIF4E present

289

in monosome and polysome fractions relative to the total signal was calculated.

Dr. Stephen Lee (Miami), HA-HIF1alpha-pcDNA3 was a gift from William Kaelin (Addgene

315

plasmid # 18949; http://n2t.net/addgene:18949; RRID:Addgene_18949), and FLAG-eIF4E2 was

316

a gift from Dong-Er Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 17342 ; http://n2t.net/addgene:17342 ;

317

RRID:Addgene_17342). Control vectors were of the same backbone and tag without a gene

318

insert. Cells were transfected with 4 μg DNA complexed with 20 μg polyethylenamine (PEI)

319

diluted in 600 μL of lactate buffered saline (20 mM sodium lactate and 150 mM NaCl, pH 4.0).

320

The DNA/PEI complexes were diluted in 2.4 mL DMEM without FBS or antibiotics and added

321

to cells at 37 °C for 8 h followed by replenishing with complete media. Cells were lysed after 48

322

h in 200 μL lysis buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-

323

40, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (New England Biolabs)]. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000

324

rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and diluted with 500 μL of dilution buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),

325

150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail]. Protein (1 mg/mL) was

326

incubated with 25 μL of GFP-Trap magnetic micro beads (ChromoTek), or anti-FLAG M2

327

magnetic beads (Sigma), or anti-HA magnetic beads (Pierce). Only GFP-Trap required pre-

328

blocking with 3% BSA in TBS [50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4] and washed as per the

329

manufacturer’s instructions. Immunoprecipitation was carried out for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation.

330

The GFP beads were washed four times with a more stringent wash buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH

331

7.4), 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40] while FLAG and HA beads were washed four

332

times with TBS. Proteins were eluted at 95 °C in 1X Laemmli sample buffer. Whole cell lysate

333

(25 μg) was used as the input.

334

Analysis of Cap-Binding Proteins

335

Performed as previously described [39]. The eIF4E2 signal in input and cap-elution lanes was

336

quantified by densitometry using Bio-Rad Image Lab software. The eIF4E2 signal in the DDX28

337

knockdown cap-elution lane relative to control was normalized to the eIF4E2 input signal ratio.

338

Cellular fractionation

339

After 24h of hypoxia, cells were lysed in 400 μL harvest buffer [10 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl,

340

500 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 2 mM NaF, 0.5% Triton-X100, 1X protease

341

inhibitor cocktail]. Lysates were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. The

342

supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction and the nuclear pellet was washed twice

343

with 800 μL nuclear wash buffer [10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA,

344

10 mM DTT, 2 mM NaF, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail] centrifuging at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5

345

and 10 min following washes. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 400 μL RIPA buffer [20

346

mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM

347

EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 2 mM NaF, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail] and rotated at 4 °C for 15 min.

348

Insoluble proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the

349

supernatant was collected as the nuclear fraction. Equal volumes of cytoplasmic and nuclear

350

samples were mixed with 1X Laemmli sample buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 90 sec for western

351

blot analysis.

352

Viability assay

353

For each indicated time point, 10,000 cells per well were plated in triplicate in a 24-well plate.

354

The following day (day 0), cells were incubated at their indicated oxygen concentrations, and

355

following each 24 h increment, cells were washed once with PBS and stained with 400 μL of 1%

356

crystal violet solution prepared in 20% methanol, with gentle rocking for 20 min at room

temperature. Cells were gently washed with water to remove excess stain. Plates were air-dried

358

overnight, and 400 μL of 10 % acetic acid was added to each well and incubated on a shaker for

359

20 min at room temperature for de-staining. The absorbance at 595 nm was measured using the

360

ThermoMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).

361

Cell proliferation assay

362

Cells (250,000) were seeded on coverslips and incubated at their indicated oxygen

363

concentrations for 24 h prior to treatment with 10 μmol/l bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cell

364

proliferation labeling reagent (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in cold

365

methanol for 10 min. Excess methanol was removed by washing for 5 min with PBS, and

366

coverslips were incubated with 1:100 primary anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody (RPN202; GE

367

Healthcare) in the dark for 1 h. Coverslips were washed three times for 5 min with PBS and

368

incubated with 2 μg/mL goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555 secondary antibody (Invitrogen,), in

369

the dark for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were counterstained with Hoechst (1 μg/mL) for 5 min, and

370

coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent

371

(Invitrogen). Cells were imaged with the Nikon eclipse Ti-S inverted microscope. An average of

372

200 cells were assessed for positive BrdU labeling per biological replicate.

373

Statistical analyses

374

Results are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m) of at least three independent

375

experiments. Experimental data were tested using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test when only

376

two means were compared, or a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD test when three or

377

more means were compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant using GraphPad

Figure 7. Model of HIF-2α regulation via DDX28. (A) In situations of low DDX28 such as 1%

581

O 2 hypoxia or shRNA depletion of DDX28 in normoxia, HIF-2α becomes more stabilized and

582

shifts the balance toward complex formation with eIF4E2 and a higher affinity for the m7GTP 5'

583

cap structure. This, along with the binding of known interactors eIF4G3, eIF4A and RBM4,

584

induces the translation of transcripts harboring RNA hypoxia response elements (rHRE) in their

585

3'UTR. (B) Steady-state or “normal” DDX28 levels observed in normoxia contribute to the

586

normoxic decrease in HIF-2α protein levels through binding with DDX28 and shifts the balance

587

away from the formation of an activating complex with eIF4E2, repressing this non-canonical

588

cap-dependent translation pathway. Since depleting DDX28 in hypoxia activates eIF4E2-

589

dependent translation even further, we propose that some DDX28 is required in hypoxia to

590

restrain this oncogenic pathway.
