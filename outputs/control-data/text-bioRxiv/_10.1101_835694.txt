Abstract

17

Bacterial genetic material can be horizontally transferred between microorganisms

18

via outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by bacteria. Up to now, the application of

19

vesicle-mediated horizontal transfer of “degrading genes” in environmental remediation

20

has not been reported. In this study, the nirS gene from an aerobic denitrification

21

bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri, was enclosed in a pET28a plasmid, transformed into

22

Escherichia coli (E. coli) DH5α and expressed in E. coli BL21. The E. coli DH5α

23

released OMVs containing the recombination plasmid pET28a–nirS. Moreover, the

24

amount of released OMVs-protein and DNA in OMVs increase as heavy metal

25

concentrations and temperature increased. When compared with the free pET28a–nirS

26

plasmid’s inability to transform, nirS in OMVs could be transferred into E. coli BL21

27

with the transformation frequency of 2.76×106 CFU/g when the dosage of OMVs was

28

200 µg under natural conditions, and nirS could express successfully in recipient bacteria.

29

Furthermore, the recipient bacteria that received OMVs could produce 18.16 U ml-1

30

activity of nitrite reductase. Vesicle-mediated HGT of aerobic denitrification genes

31

provides a novel bioaugmentation technology of nitrogen removal.

Importance

Previous studies have reported that bacterial genetic material can be horizontally

35

transferred between microorganisms via outer membrane vesicles(OMVs) released by

36

bacteria. However, the application of vesicle-mediated horizontal transfer of “degrading

37

genes” in environmental remediation has not been reported. In this study, we found that

38

OMVs could mediate horizontal transfer of pET28a–nirS plasmid between E. coli under

Introduction

47

High nitrogen concentrations in water result in water eutrophication and pollution.

48

Traditional bio-treatment processes for nitrogen removal involve autotrophic and

49

heterotrophic denitrification under aerobic and anoxic conditions, respectively (1).

50

Because of their different oxygen requirements, these two steps are separated spatially

51

and temporally. Recently, more researchers have focused on nitrogen removal using

52

aerobic denitrification bacteria. Unlike traditional anaerobic denitrification mechanisms,

53

aerobic denitrification occurs via co-respiration or co-metabolism of O2 and NO3 .

54

Additionally, nitrification and denitrification can occur in the same aerobic denitrification

55

system (2, 3). Nitrate reductase (napA), nitrite reductase (nirS), nitric oxide reductase

56

(norB) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) are four key enzymes in the aerobic

57

denitrification process of aerobic denitrifying bacteria. The aerobic denitrification

58

bacteria or microbial consortium can be added into wastewater for promoting the removal

59

efficiency of nitrogen (4). In addition, gene bioaugmentation is considered to be a

60

promising biological enhancement process, which also promotes pollutant removal by

61

horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (5).

-

62

HGT is common and important in microorganisms because it enables the bacteria to

63

accept exogenous functional gene fragments to obtain new metabolic functions and then

64

present a new ecological phenotype (6, 7). Artificially constructed plasmids with

65

degradation genes to accelerate the horizontal transfer of these genes in contaminated

66

areas have become a research hotspot (8, 9). HGT provides a new idea for

67

bioaugmentation technology in the field of environmental remediation; indigenous

68

microorganisms in a contaminated system obtain degradation genes from self-apoptosis

69

of recombinantly engineered bacteria or the natural release of bacteria to improve the

70

pollutants’ degradation efficiency. However, free-DNA in the environment is easily

71

degraded by DNase I enzyme, and high temperatures cause the DNA to break down

72

naturally.

73

In the past 30 years, studies have found that a wide variety of Gram-negative

74

bacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli (10), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (11), Pseudomonas

75

aeruginosa (12),

76

Acinetobacter baumannii (15) and Helicobacter pylori (16) can release outer membrane

77

vesicles (OMVs), a kind of spherical nanometer-sized proteolipids. The analysis of

78

vesicle components revealed vesicles contained outer membrane proteins (i.e., OM-

79

anchored lipoproteins, OM phospholipids and LPS), inner membrane proteins,

80

periplasmic components (i.e., periplasmic protein and hydrolase), signaling molecules,

81

virulence factors, DNAs and RNAs (17-22). Most research indicates that vesicles play an

82

important role in bacterial life activities. Vesicles can be used as carriers for transporting

83

signaling molecules (20, 23, 24), virulence factors(25, 26) and resistance genes (11, 27)

84

to other bacteria. Reports suggest that genes can be transferred via OMVs. S. Fulsundar et

85

al. (28) found that exposure to OMVs isolated from plasmid-containing donor cells

86

results in HGT to A. baylyi and E. coli at transfer frequencies ranging from 10-6 to 10-8,

87

with transfer efficiencies of approximately 103 and 102 per g of vesicular DNA,

88

respectively. C. Rumbo et al. (29) provided evidence that carbapenem resistance genes

89

OXA-24 were delivered to surrounding A. baumannii bacterial via vesicles. In addition,

90

chromosomal DNA presented in OMVs was found to transfer between P. gingivalis at a

91

frequency of 1.9×10-7 (30). S. Yaron et al. (25) showed vesicle-mediated transfer of

92

plasmid and phage DNA from E. coli O157:H7 to E. coli JM109 and phage DNA to S.

93

enterica serovar Enteritidis ATCC 13076. H. X. Chiura et al. (31) revealed that the

94

highest gene transfer frequencies were up to 1.04×102 via vesicles harvested from

95

seawater.

96

However, research on horizontal transfer of genes via vesicles focuses mainly on the

97

horizontal transfer of antibiotic genes via vesicles on global bacterial resistance (11, 28,

98

32) or vesicle-mediated virulence genes in bacterial pathogenesis (25). There are few

99

studies on the horizontal transfer of “degradation genes” via vesicles in repairing

100

environmental pollution. With the rapid development of chemical, petroleum, synthetic

101

ammonia and cooking industries, a slew of nitrogen-containing substances is discharged

102

into bodies of water, resulting in eutrophication.

103

In this study, the nirS gene cloned from an aerobic denitrification bacteria,

104

Pseudomonas stutzeri was inserted into a pET28a plasmid, and thereby transformed to E.

105

coli DH5α. We evaluated the characteristic of OMVs released from the recombinant

106

strain and studied the vesicle-mediated HGT of the nirS gene to enhance the

107

denitrification efficiency of microorganisms in nitrogen-containing wastewater. We hope

108

to explore a novel bioaugmentation technology using HGT for biological denitrification

109

technology.

Results

Cloning and analysis of the EGFP and full-length nirS

113

EGFP, the green fluorescent protein gene, was cloned from a laboratory preservation

114

solution, and the sequencing results were consistent with the NCBI database (GenBank

115

Accession: AFA52650.1). The gene nirS is one of the four aerobic denitrification genes,

116

which can convert NO2- to NO by a reduction reaction. The full-length DNA (1713 bp) of

117

nirS was amplified from P. stutzeri by PCR and deposited into GenBank under accession

118

number MN199166. The open reading frame (ORF) encodes a protein of 570 amino

119

acids. The molecular weight of nirS was approximately 63 kDa and was consistent with

120

the estimated molecular weight of the enzyme. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences

121

of the full-length DNA are shown in Fig. S1. The sequence similarity of the nirS gene

122

from P. stutzeri BNCC 139708 with the homologous strains P. stutzeri CCUG 29243, P.

123

stutzeri CGMCC 1.1803, P. stutzeri R2A2 and P. stutzeri 19SMN4 was 99.47%, 98.07%,

124

95.80% and 94.83%, respectively. The similarity of their amino acid sequences was

125

100%, 99.79%, 95.80% and 94.92%, respectively. The secondary structures of their

126

proteins encoding nirS were similar, and there was no difference except for the N-

127

terminus of P. stutzeri 19 SMN 4 (Fig. S2). The proportions of alpha-helix, extended

128

strand, beta turn and random coil in the five P. stutzeri were approximately similar. These

129

results indicated that P. stutzeri BNCC 139708 was highly homologous with other four

130

species of P. stutzeri, and the nirS gene was conservative in the evolution process.

131

The analysis of signal peptide sequence in the nirS showed that the C and Y value

132

were the highest and the S value was steep at the 24th amino acid where was the

133

predicted signal peptide cutting site (Fig. S3). The 1- 23 amino acid was the position of

134

the nitrite reductase signal peptide. The number of transmembrane helix amino acid

135

residues in the nirS was 2.83622, and the amount of transmembrane helix amino acid in

136

the first 60 amino acids was 2.83343. Fig. S4 showed that there was a transmembrane

137

helix signal in the first 100 amino acids which was the signal peptide sequence in the

138

nirS. So the protein encoding the nirS was not a transmembrane protein. The nirS gene

139

could be constructed into a vector for prokaryotic expression.

Construction and expression of pET28a-nirS-EGFP and pET28a-nirS plasmids

142

In this study, the plasimids harboring napA, norB, nirS and nosZ gene were

143

constructed, respectively. However, only the nirS gene could be expressed in E. coli

144

BL21; therefore, we selected the plasmid harboring nirS as the object gene of HGT. The

145

construction of pET28a-nirS-EGFP and pET28a-nirS plasmids is shown in Fig. 1a and

146

Fig. S6. The two plasmids were transformed and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). As

147

shown in Fig. 1b, E. coli BL21(DE3), containing the recombinant plasmid pET28a-nirS,

148

was induced by 0.2 mM IPTG to express soluble 63 kDa. The optimal induced expression

149

condition of pET28a-nirS was 16 °C at 110 rpm for 16 h. For E. coli BL21(DE3)

150

containing the recombinant plasmid pET28a-nirS-EGFP, the SDS-PAGE after IPTG

151

induction showed a band at approximately 89 kDa, corresponding to the expected size of

152

the fusion protein (Fig. 1c, lane 2). For BL21(DE3) cells transformed with empty

153

pET28a, SDS-PAGE after IPTG induction showed no band (Fig. 1c, lane 1).

154

Furthermore, western blotting results showed there were obvious bands at the

155

corresponding positions, indicating that E. coli BL21(DE3) successfully expressed the

156

fusion protein (Fig. 1d).

158

OMVs released from E. coli harboring the plasmid pET28a-nirS

159

In this study, we transformed the plasmid pET28a-nirS into E. coli DH5α and

160

observed if the transformed E. coli could release OMVs. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, E.

161

coli DH5α harboring the plasmid could release OMVs. OMVs production by E. coli

162

strain was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, indicating that E. coli actively

163

released OMVs without any external stimulation during its growth. OMVs were isolated

164

from bacteria in late stationary phase by an ultra-high-speed freezing centrifuge. Fig.2a

165

indicates the process of OMVs released from the outer membrane of E. coli. OMVs have

166

a spherical structure with a bilayer membrane, with an average diameter of 25 nm. The

167

solution containing OMVs were observed with a microscope and coated on a plate with

168

Luria-Bertani agar (LA) medium. There were no bacteria found under the microscope and

169

no bacterial growth on the plate overnight, indicating that OMVs extracted in this study

170

had high purity.

171

DNA in the OMVs from E. coli-nirS was amplified by PCR using specific primers

172

for the nirS gene. As shown in Fig. 2c, there was a band of nirS genes, showing that

173

OMVs carried the pET28a-nirS plasmid, but the typical nirS band was not detected in the

174

supernatant removed from E. coli-nirS and OMVs. SDS-PAGE analysis of protein

175

concentration of OMVs from E. coli DH5α under different stress conditions is shown in

176

Fig. S5.

178

Effect of environmental stresses on vesiculation and inclusion content in OMVs

179

To evaluate the effect of environmental stresses on OMVs released from bacteria,

180

heavy metals (Cu2+ 25 mg l-1, 50 mg l-1; Cd2+ 5 mg l-1) were added to the culture medium

181

to stimulate the release of OMVs from E.coli. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the

182

concentration of inclusions (protein and DNA) in OMVs and diameter of OMVs

183

increased with increasing concentrations of Cu2+. In addition, OMVs’ diameter increased

184

when the concentration of Cd2+ increased to 5 mg/L but decreased when Cd2+ increased

185

to 25 mg l-1. The results showed that different metals had different effects on the release

186

of OMVs. In contrast, temperature increases from 25 °C to 37 °C caused a decrease in

187

OMVs’ diameter while increasing the concentrations of protein and DNA in OMVs from

Horizontal transfer of the aerobic denitrification gene (nirS)

191

In this study, the membrane of OMVs released from E. coli-nirS/EGFP was

192

fluorescently stained with CM-DiI dye (orange color) (Fig. 5, upper panel), and E. coli

193

BL21 was fluorescently stained with DiO dye (green color). The stained OMVs and E.

194

coli BL21 were incubated together to observe vesicle-mediated horizontal transfer of nirS

195

from E. coli DH5α to E. coli BL21. After 1 h incubation, the receptor E. coli BL21

196

simultaneously emitted green and orange fluorescence under a fluorescence microscope

197

(Fig. 5, lower panels). OMVs and E. coli BL21 were observed as light green under

198

confocal laser microscopy (LCSM), indicating that free OMVs could directly contact and

199

adsorb on the cell membrane of the receptor E. coli BL21 cell. After culturing OMVs

200

released from E. coli-nirS/EGFP added to a culture medium containing E. coli BL21, all

201

the bacterial liquid was uniformly coated on an LA plate with kanamycin resistance.

202

Individual clones were selected for culture and induced with IPTG after which we

203

observed green fluorescent protein expression in the E. coli BL21 strain using LCSM

204

(Fig. 6). The results showed that E. coli BL21 could produce green fluorescence,

205

suggesting that the aerobic denitrification gene (nirS) had been horizontally transferred to

206

E. coli BL21 via OMVs and successfully expressed in E. coli BL21. The SDS-PAGE

207

analysis of protein product from the receptor E. coli BL21 showed significant expression

208

of the nirS gene. The expressed nitrite reductase was detected under a different induction

209

temperature; moreover, the temperature greatly affected nitrite reductase activity. In

210

addition, reductase activity reached to 18.16 U ml-1 under an optimal induced temperature

211

of 22 °C as shown in Fig. 7.

213

Transformation frequency of OMVs

214

Transformation experiments were successful in E. coli BL21 via OMVs isolated

215

from E. coli-nirS with different amounts (50, 100 and 200 µg of protein). As shown in

216

Fig.8, when the dosage of OMVs was 200 µg, the transformation frequency of nirS

217

reached to 2.76×106 CFU/g; moreover, it increased with the dosage of OMVs. No

218

transformants were obtained when free pET28a-nirS plasmid (20 ng) was incubated with

219

E. coli BL21, indicating that free plasmid DNA could not be transformed into recipient

220

cells without OMVs as a “protective shell” or with any treatment of the recipient bacteria

221

(preparation of competent cells through heat-shock during transformation). The pET28a-

222

nirS plasmid protected by OMVs successfully transferred to recipient strains in a dose-

223

dependent manner.

224
225

Discussion

226

Previous studies have reported that vesicles released from the bacterial outer

227

membrane are loaded with many bacterial contents. Different types of nucleic acids (i.e.,

228

chromosomes, plasmids, DNA and RNA) were found in OMVs released from Gram-

229

negative bacteria, as shown in Table 1. In this study, the gene nirS was also detected in

230

vesicles released by recombinant E. coli-nirS. Moreover, the amount of released vesicles

231

containing DNA was affected by temperature and heavy metals.

232

Reports indicate that different stress conditions, including antibiotics (28),

233

temperature (10), ultraviolet irradiation (28, 33), virulence factors (34), SOS response

234

(35), oxygen stress (36), nutritional deprivation (28) and physical pressure (34), can

235

affect the number of vesicles released from bacteria. In this study, the release of OMVs

236

was stimulated by adding heavy metals to the environment when the bacteria growth rate

237

was unrestricted. The results showed that the release of OMVs increased with the

238

increase of heavy metal toxicity. The Tol–Pal, an inner membrane protein systems of

239

gram-negative bacteria, interacts with peptidoglycan (PG) to maintain cell membrane

240

stability. Studies have shown that disruption of the Tol-Pal system or lack of interaction

241

in the outer membrane protein-peptidoglycan and the inner membrane protein-

242

peptidoglycan induces membrane instability, causing cells to increase vesicle biogenesis

243

to maintain membrane stability (37, 38). Heavy metal toxicity may cause damage to the

244

cell membrane, causing local deletion of the Tol-Pal system or a decrease in the amount

245

of membrane protein and resulting in the release of a large amount of OMVs by E. coli.

246

However, when the concentration of Cd2+ increased to 25 mg l-1, the amount of OMVs

247

released by bacteria decreased. This may be due to bacterial growth rate inhibition under

248

the stimulation of high heavy metal concentrations, reducing the amount of OMVs

249

released by cells in the early stage of bacterial growth. Recent studies have also shown

250

that high growth temperatures can increase the number of vesicles produced. In this

251

study, when the culture temperature of the E. coli increased from 25 °C to 37 °C, the

252

number of produced OMVs increased. The temperature stress increases the accumulation

253

of misfolded proteins, which will be transported out from bacteria by promoting the

254

formation of OMVs to maintain normal cell physiological activity (10).

255

In this study, when compared with the control, DNA content increased with the

256

increase of heavy metal toxicity and temperature without affecting the growth rate of

257

bacteria. In addition, the diameter of OMVs released by E. coli increased under

258

temperature and heavy metal stress, possibly due to serious distortions in cell membranes.

259

Moreover, it was easier for larger OMVs to load intracellular substances, resulting in

260

increased DNA content in OMVs.

261

Horizontal transfer of specific degradation genes not only improves the survival rate

262

of microorganisms in the system but also enhances the biodegradation efficiency of

263

pollutants (39-41). Many studies have shown that vesicles can accelerate the flow of

264

genes between microorganisms. It is valuable for ecological environment restoration

265

efforts to study the horizontal transfer efficiency of pollutant degradation genes between

266

microorganisms under vesicle protection. In this study, it was not only confirmed that

267

OMVs from E. coli were loaded with aerobic denitrification genes but also found that the

268

aerobic denitrification gene nirS could be successfully transferred to E. coli BL21 via

269

OMVs and expressed in E. coli BL21. This indicates that OMVs-mediated horizontal

270

transfer of “degradation genes” promotes the degrading ability of microorganisms and

271

plays an active role in pollution remediation.

272

Vesicles in the environment transfer DNA into the recipient cell by fusing with the

273

outer membrane (23), or entire vesicles are absorbed into receptor cells by dynamin-

274

dependent endocytosis (26, 42). These pathways are equally applicable to the transport of

275

virulence factors between bacteria and vesicles. In this study, we labeled OMVs and E.

276

coli-nirS with fluorescence and found that free OMVs could be directly adsorbed on the

277

cell membrane of E. coli BL21. Previously, it was reported that human intestinal

278

epithelial cells (Caco-2), brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and glomerular

279

endothelial cells (HRGEC) could ingest vesicles labeled with rhodamine isothiocyanate

280

B-R18 by endocytosis of kinase protein (26). In the present study, it was also observed

281

that OMVs could be internalized into cells with no functional hindrance; OMVs fused

282

with the receptor after contacting receptor cells and released substances into the recipient

283

cytoplasm. The discovery of this process provides a practical basis for enhancing genetic

284

material exchange mediated by OMVs in bacterial communities.

285

Studies of these bacterial OMVs support a common role of vesicles on easy

286

exchange of genetic material between bacteria (29, 43, 44), indicating that vesicle-

287

mediated HGT could enhance gene fluidity among species and improve the survival rate

of sensitive bacteria in the environment. The mechanism can be applied to the field of

289

environmental remediation. Bacteria in a polluted environment can obtain degradation

290

genes by vesicles to improve the efficiency of pollutant removal. In this study, after

291

adding OMVs loaded with pET28a-nirS-EGFP recombinant plasmid into liquid medium

292

containing E. coli BL21, we discovered that E. coli BL21 could express nitrite reductase

293

and green fluorescent protein, showing that bacteria obtained the ability to reduce nitrite.

294

Moreover, the process of DNA transformation mediated by OMVs was dose-dependent

295

because the frequency of HGT increased with the increase of OMVs.

Molecular cloning of full-length nirS and EGFP

309

The DNAMAN software was used to compare multiple nirS genes of P. stutzeri on

310

the NCBI website to design homologous primers. The full-length nirS was generated

311

from P. stutzeri by PCR using homologous primers N1 and N2 (Table S2). The

312

procedures were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles (94 °C for 60 s, 62 °C

313

for 40 s and 72 °C for 10 min). The full-length EGFP was generated by PCR with primers

314

EGFP-P1 and EGFP-P2 (Table S2). The procedures were as follows: PCR was performed

315

for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 60 s. TA cloning was carried

316

out after purifying the PCR products by cutting gel recovery, and five recombinant

317

plasmids were screened and sequenced by Shanghai Biotechnology Service Company.

318

The sequence of the nirS was submitted on NCBI website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)

319

which can be used for homology analysis. The secondary protein structure of the nirS was

320

analyzed on SOPMA website (https://npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr). The signal peptide sequence of

321

the gene was analyzed by Detaibio bioinformatics tools (http://www.detaibio.com/tools/).

322

The presence and Location of transmembrane region in the nirS sequence was predicted

323

by TMHMM2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk).

325

Construction, expression and purification of nirS-EGFP and nirS

326

We used overlap PCR to generate the nirS-EGFP fusion gene. The following four

327

primers, designed based on the sequences of EGFP and nirS, were used (Table S2). The

328

nirS gene was cloned by PCR using primers A1 and A2 with an extra NcoI recognition

329

site at its 5′ end. The procedures were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles

330

(95 °C for 22 s, 60 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 50 s). The primers A3 and A4 were used to

331

amplify the DNA sequence of EGFP, which contains an XhoI recognition site at its 3′

332

end. PCR was performed for 30 cycles of 95 °C for 22 s, 60 C for 20 s and 72 °C for 50

333

s. Products of the first PCR round were gel purified and subjected to a second round of

334

PCR using A1 and A4 primers to generate a product encoding nirS-EGFP, containing a

335

linker-encoding sequence between the two domains. Amplification was performed for 30

336

cycles of denaturation for 22 s at 95 °C, annealing for 20 s at 60 °C and extension for 75 s

337

at 72°C. The nirS and nirS-EGFP PCR products were digested with BamHI and Hind III

338

or NcoI and XhoI, respectively, and ligated into the pET28a plasmid at the corresponding

339

restriction sites. The construction of plasmids pET28a-nirS and pET28a-nirS-EGFP is

340

shown in Figs. S3 and S4. Recombinant plasmid pET28a-nirS and pET28a-nirS-EGFP

341

were transformed into E. coli DH5α competent cells for propagation of recombinant

342

plasmids, which was named E. coli-nirS or E. coli-nirS/EGFP.

343

The recombinant plasmids pET28a-nirS and pET28a-nirS-EGFP were transformed

344

into competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells to express the fusion protein. LB medium of 50

345

ml (50 μg ml-1 kanamycin) was inoculated (1:50) with E. coli BL21 with recombinant

346

plasmid pET28a-nirS suspension and grown at 37 °C at 220 rpm until reaching an optical

347

density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.4–0.6. Then, expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM

348

isopropyl-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the cultures were incubated for 16 h at

349

16 °C at 150 rpm. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 8000×g for 25 min at

350

4 °C. Pellets were treated with sonication on ice for a 4 s pulse with an intervening 4 s

351

pause until cells were completely lysed. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000×g for 20 min

352

at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected to analyze them on polyacrylamide gel

electrophoresis (PAGE).

354

To produce soluble pET28a-nirS-EGFP proteins, the following induction scheme

355

was established: final IPTG concentration, 0.2 mM; induction temperature, 16 °C; total

356

induction duration, 16 h; shaking speed, 110 rpm. After induction, bacteria were

357

harvested by centrifugation at 8000×g for 25 min at 4 °C. Pellets were treated with

358

sonication on ice for a 4 s pulse with an intervening 4 s pause until cells were completely

359

lysed. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the fusion protein

360

was purified using His-Bind columns (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) and analyzed by

361

SDS-PAGE using gels containing 12% polyacrylamide. After electrophoresis, the gel was

362

transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Bucks, UK), and the nitrocellulose

363

membranes were blocked for 4 h with TBST solution containing 5% skim milk powder.

364

After being washed with TBS five times, the blots were incubated with an anti-His6-tag

365

monoclonal antibody (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) at 37 °C for 2 h. After the

366

reaction, the membranes were washed for three times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS)

367

solution (pH=7.4) for 10 min each time. The membranes were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C

368

with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in TBST buffer (Tris

369

10 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Tween-20 0.05%(V/V), HCl to PH 7.5) containing 5% skim milk.

370

At the end of hybridization, the color was developed with TMB (promega). When the

371

band appeared, the film was washed with water immediately to stop the reaction.

Determination of nitrite reductase activity

374

E. coli BL21 containing the recombinant plasmid nirS-pET28a or pET28a-nirS-

375

EGFP was inoculated into 50 ml of LB medium and cultured at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 8

377

concentration of 0.2 mM IPTG at 16 °C and 110rpm for 16h. The induced bacterial liquid

378

was broken by sonication and centrifuged at 8000×g. The obtained supernatant was a

379

crude enzyme sample of nitrite reductase. The crude enzyme (100 μl) was added into the

380

reaction system containing Phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) 10 mM, sodium nitrite NaNO2 1

381

mM, methyl amethyst 1 mM, sodium thiosulfate 5 mM, and ddH2O up to 2 ml in a water

382

bath at 30 °C for 30 min before the reaction was terminated by violent shaking. Griess

383

color developer was then added and reacted at room temperature for 20 min; the

384

absorbance was measured at 420 nm with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Lambda 25,

385

PerkinElmer Company, USA).

386
387

Isolation of OMVs

388

OMVs were isolated from late log-phase culture of E. coli-nirS followed by J.

389

Habier et al. (45). In brief, 500 ml of LB medium was inoculated with 5 ml of culture

390

grown to OD600 equal to 1.0 and was incubated at 37 °C on a shaker at 150 rpm in 50mg

391

l-1 kanamycin . To isolate OMVs from cultures grown under heavy metal stress, liquid

392

cultures were grown on a shaker with sub-inhibitory concentrations of copper ion (25 mg

393

l-1 or 50 mg l-1) or chromium ion (5 mg l-1 or 25 mg l-1). For temperature stress

394

experiments, the temperature was raised to 37 °C. After cells were centrifuged using a 50

395

ml tube at 8000×g for 25 min, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 mm membrane

396

(Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA) to remove cells. The filtrate was

397

concentrated 50-fold using 100 kDa ultrafiltration tube (Millipore Corporation, Bedford,

398

MA, USA) and then filtered through a 0.22 μm vacuum membrane to remove any

399

remaining cells and cell debris. The filtrate was put into an ultra-high-speed centrifuge

400

(Optima MAX-TL, Beckman, USA) at 160,000×g and 4C for 3 h. The pellet of the

401

extracted OMVs suspended in PBS was ultracentrifuged at 160,000×g and 4 C for 1 h

402

for 2 times. The pellet of the extracted OMVs was finally re-suspended in 500 μl of PBS.

403
404

Purification of OMVs

405

Crude OMVs were purified by density gradient as described by H. Chutkan et al.

406

(46). Briefly, 600 μl of crude OMVs was added to the bottom of a 5 ml centrifuge tube,

407

and 400 μl of 60%, 1 ml of 40%, 1 ml of 35%, 1 ml of 30% and 1 ml of 25%

408

OptiPrep/PBS gradient centrifuge solutions were added from bottom to top. The gradients

409

were centrifuged (160,000×g) for 6 h at 4 °C. Five fractions of equal volume were

410

collected from the bottom. Each fraction was washed at the same speed by adding PBS

411

buffer 10 times and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Protein content of purified OMVs was

412

estimated using the Bradford assay (47), which can also be used for quantitative

413

calculation of vesicles.

414
415

Determination of aerobic denitrification gene (nirS) and total DNA in OMVs

416

The total DNA in OMVs was quantified by an ultramicro spectrophotometer

417

(NanoDrop 2000C, Thermo Fisher, USA). Briefly, vesicular proteins of 50 μg were

418

treated with 2 μl proteinase K (20 mg ml-1) at 37 C for 30 min to hydrolyze the

419

bacteriophage. Proteinase K was inactivated at 80 C for 5 min. The surface-associated

420

DNA of OMVs was degraded by adding 2 μl of DNase I (5 U μl-1) at 37 C for 1 h.

421

DNase I was permanently inactivated at 80 C for 5 min by adding 0.5 M EDTA (Sagon

422

Biotech, Shanghai, China). Subsequently, treated OMVs were lysed with 0.25% Triton X19

423

100 solution (Sagon Biotech, Shanghai, China) for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA released by

424

OMVs was extracted by a SanPrep column PCR product purification kit (Sagon Biotech,

425

Shanghai, China) and quantified by an ultramicro spectrophotometer. To determine the

426

nirS gene existed in OMVs, extracted DNA was re-suspended in 15 μl of TE buffer DNA.

427

DNA of OMVs from E. coli-nirS was amplified by PCR using primers (Table S1). PCR

428

products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose.

429
430

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

431

Vesicle suspension from E. coli-nirS was negatively stained with freshly prepared

432

2% aqueous uranyl acetate on carbon-coated nickel grids (300 mesh) (Sigma). The excess

433

stain was blotted, and the grid was washed once with distilled water and dried.

434

Micrographs were obtained by TEM (JEM1400, Japan). To observe the cellular structure

435

and OMVs release from E. coli, the bacterial culture was pipetted into a 1.5 ml centrifuge

436

tube and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. Then, the supernatant was removed, and

437

cells were washed with PBS solution (pH=7.4) for 3 times. Afterward, the collected

438

bacterial samples were fixed with 2.5% cold glutaraldehyde for overnight at 4 °C. After

439

being washed, the bacterial sample was dehydrated by ethanol and acetone, embedded

440

and stained with Osmium tetroxide (OsO4). The treated sample was heated at 70 C

441

overnight using a heating polymerization apparatus. Ultra-thin slices (50–70 nm) of the

442

sample were made by an ultra-thin slicing machine. Finally, the section was placed on

443

carbon-coated nickel grids and stained with freshly prepared 2% aqueous uranyl acetate

444

for 3 min, after which E. coli was observed under TEM.

Transformation of aerobic denitrification gene (nirS) via OMVs in liquid cultures

447

E. coli BL21 cells were collected (2000×g) at 4 °C for 10 min in a logarithmic

448

growth period. After removing the supernatant, cells were re-suspended by 100 μl of

449

fresh SOC medium (59% Tryptone; 15% Yeast Extract; 1.4% NaCl; 15% MgSO47H2O;

450

11% D-Glucose) and then mixed with different amounts of purified OMVs (containing

451

50, 100 and 200 μg of protein) released from E. coli-nirS. The suspensions were

452

incubated statically at 37 °C for 4 h and then for another 4 h on a shaker at 150 rpm. LB

453

broth (10 ml) was then added to the suspension, and the culture continued at 37 °C

454

overnight at 150 rpm. Finally, the overnight culture was centrifuged at 8000×g and then

455

suspended in 500 μl LB medium. The 250 μl resuspension was placed on a plate with LA

456

medium and 50 mg l-1 kanamycin. Successful transformation in E. coli BL21 was

457

confirmed by observing positive colony numbers and the nirS gene by PCR. To ensure

458

that the transformation experiment was mediated by DNA in the OMVs, the OMVs in the

459

experiment have been treated with DNase I and proteinase K. Gene transfer frequencies

460

were calculated from three independent experiments as the number of gene transfer

461

events over the number of recipient cells.

464

The purified OMVs were stained with CellTracker™ CM-DiI Dye (Thermo Fisher),

465

which is non-fluorescent in aqueous solution, and were labeled by binding OMVs to lipid

466

molecules of the membrane structure. OMVs were incubated with 0.5 μM CM-DiI dye at

467

37 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 20,000  g and 4°C for 2 h. The stained OMVs

468

were washed twice with PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and then re-suspended in 100 μl PBS. E.

coli BL21 cells were stained with VybrantTM DiO live cell tracer (ThermoFisher). Cell-

470

labeling solution (5 μl) was put into 1 ml of E. coli BL21 cell suspension (1×106 ml-1)

471

and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Finally, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 2000 

472

g for 10 min. After the supernatant was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS

473

buffer (pH 7.4) and then re-suspended in 500 μl PBS before stained OMVs with CM-DiI

474

fluorescence were added. Then, the mixed liquid was incubated statically for 45 min at

475

37 °C. OMVs and E. coli BL21 were separately analyzed using an excitation wavelength

476

of 553 nm and 484 nm under a laser confocal scanning microscope (LSM710, Zeiss,

477

Germany) within 1 h. E. coli BL21 successfully transformed with pET28a-nirS-EGFP

478

recombinant plasmid via OMVs was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG for 12 h at 16 °C and
