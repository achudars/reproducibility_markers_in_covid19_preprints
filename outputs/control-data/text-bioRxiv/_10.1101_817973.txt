Abstract
Hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention are core symptoms dimensions in attention-

3

deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Some approaches suggest that these symptoms arise

4

from deficits in the ability to anticipate and process rewards. However, evidence is

5

equivocal with regard to ADHD-related differences in brain activity during reward

6

processing. The aim of this study was to investigate when, and how, reward-related

7

ERP activity was associated with hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and inattention

8

symptoms. Adults with ADHD (n=34) and matched comparison participants (n=36)

9

completed an electrophysiological version of the Monetary Incentive Delay task. This

10

task separates reward processing into two stages- namely, an anticipation stage and

11

a delivery stage. During the anticipation stage, visual cues signalled a possible

12

monetary incentive (i.e. a reward or loss). After a brief delay, the delivery stage began,

13

and

14

Electroencephalogram activity was simultaneously sampled and incentive-related

15

event relate potentials (ERPs) calculated. These data were then analysed by

16

calculating multiple regression models, at each sample point, wherein the correlation

17

between incentive-related ERPs and ADHD symptoms was estimated. Linear and

18

curvilinear associations between ERP activity and ADHD symptoms were tested in

19

each regression mode. Findings suggest that ADHD symptoms were associated ERP

20

activity at different reward processing stages. Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were

21

associated with reduced ERP activity during the initial anticipation of rewards from

22

224-329 ms post-reward cue. Inattention symptoms were associated with reduced

23

ERP activity during the initial delivery of rewards from 251-280 ms post-reward onset.

24

Finally, extreme ends of hyperactive/impulsive and inattention symptoms were

25

associated with reduced ERP activity towards the end of the anticipation stage from

26

500 ms post-reward cue onwards. These results support the idea that reward

incentives

were

delivered

30

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental

31

disorder characterized by patterns of impulsivity, hyperactivity and/or inattention (1).

32

Although ADHD is typically diagnosed in childhood, behavioural symptoms continue

33

into adulthood for most individuals, with an overall prevalence rate of 3-4% (2-5).

34

Recent etiological models posit that ADHD symptoms result from a diminished ability

35

to anticipate rewards (6-8). According to these approaches, ADHD symptoms accrue

36

from lower phasic dopaminergic activity in response to reward-predictive cues (9). This

37

view is supported by evidence of ventral striatum (VS) hypoactivity in response to cues

38

that signal monetary rewards in both adult and adolescent ADHD, relative to healthy

39

comparisons (10-13). Despite these findings, however, the relationship between

40

reward processing and ADHD remains unclear. Furthermore, it is unknown whether

41

deficits in reward processing mediate specific symptoms dimensions in ADHD (e.g.

42

impulsivity and/or inattention) or the disorder in general.

43

Conflicting evidence regarding the relationship between reward processing and

44

ADHD symptoms has been reported using functional magnetic resonance imaging

45

(fMRI) and the monetary incentive delay (MID) task (14). The MID task separates

46

reward processing into two discrete stages. Across trials, a visual cue first signals a

47

possible monetary incentive: the anticipation stage. After a brief period, the incentive

48

is then delivered on a partial reinforcement-schedule, contingent on a response to a

49

target: the delivery stage. A number of studies report a negative association between

50

VS

51

hyperactive/impulsive symptoms – but not inattentive symptoms (10-13). These

52

results imply that inefficient reward anticipation underlies this specific ADHD symptom

53

dimension. However, the opposite pattern has also been found. In a recent study with

54

a large sample of adolescents, the authors reported a negative association between

activity

in

response

to

55

striatal activity in response to reward-predictive cues and inattentive symptoms – but

56

not hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (13). Moreover, others report no evidence of

57

reduced brain activity in response to reward predictive-cues in ADHD. These studies

58

instead highlight either VS hyperactivity in response to reward-predictive cues in

59

ADHD relative to comparisons or no between-group differences (15-18).

60

The lack of consensus regarding ADHD-related deficits during reward

61

processing may partly stem limits inherent in previous FMRI research. While spatially

62

informative, fMRI lacks the temporal resolution to study the transient neuro-cognitive

63

process that mediate each stage of the MID task. Indeed, the stages of reward

64

processing (such as anticipation and delivery) can be further divided into brief

65

cognitive mechanisms like cue detection, attentional allocation, motor-response

66

preparation and evaluative appraisal (19). It is possible that ADHD symptoms relate

67

to atypical patterns of activity during these discrete neuro-cognitive mechanisms

68

involved in reward processing. Therefore, alternative approaches that afford greater

69

temporal granularity are warranted.

70

An electrophysiological (EEG) version of the MID task (e-MID) represents one

71

such promising approach. This task uses event-related potentials (ERPs; time-locked

72

electroencephalograms) to precisely quantify the temporal dynamics of reward

73

processing (15, 19-22). Two ERP components are particularly relevant during the

74

anticipation stage: cue-P3 and contingent negative variation (CNV). Cue-P3

75

amplitudes occur in response to predictive cues, with a peak near 300 ms that is

76

maximal at posterior scalp spaces. Cue-P3 amplitudes are thought to reflect

77

attentional allocation (19-21). CNV ERPs are negative-going potential shifts observed

78

1000-2000 ms after the cue-P3 and are maximal at frontal scalp spaces. These

79

amplitudes are indicative of motor-response preparation. Importantly, the amplitudes

80

of both cue-P3 and CNV are increased by the motivational magnitude of the cue (20,

81

23). Three additional ERP components are relevant to the delivery stage: feedback-

82

related negativity (FRN), reward-positivity (RewP) and feedback-P3. FRN amplitudes

83

are observed from 200-300 ms after feedback and are maximal in frontro-central scalp

84

spaces. These amplitudes are thought to reflect a evaluative processing outcome; that

85

is, the negativity of FRN amplitudes increases as a function of the unfavorability of an

86

outcome (21). The RewP component occurs in approximately the same period as the

87

FRN, albeit in the context of reward delivery; the RewP component is characterised

88

by an emergent positivity that increases with relative gains (19, 24, 25). P3 amplitudes

89

following incentive feedback (FB-P3) have also been reported, reflecting enhanced

90

attentional allocation towards salient outcomes (20, 21). Using these incentive-related

91

ERPs as guide, the current study sought to better characterise the relationship

92

between ADHD symptoms and neuro-cognitive mechanisms of reward processing.

93

Another important consideration is the possible curvilinear association between

94

ADHD symptoms and activity in reward-related brain areas. While there is evidence

95

of VS hypoactivity in individuals diagnosed with ADHD relative to comparison groups

96

(10-12), the opposite finding exists in studies with community samples. These latter

97

studies instead report a relative VS hyperactivity in individuals with elevated ADHD

98

symptoms (26, 27). It has therefore been suggested that the relationship between

99

ADHD symptoms and brain activity is dimensional and follows an inverted-u-shape

100

(9). That is, maximal brain activation is present at mid-range ADHD symptom-severity,

101

with reduced brain activation present at the extreme ends of ADHD symptom-severity

102

scale (9). However, there is a lack of direct evidence for this inverted-u-shaped

103

association. One reason is that between-group designs, which compare high and low

104

symptom reporters, are insensitive to curvilinear associations between brain activity

and symptoms. A continuous analysis is required to better examine the dimensional

106

association between brain activity and ADHD symptoms.

107

No previous study has examined reward processing in adult ADHD using the

108

e-MID task. We therefore administered this task to a sample of adults with a wide

109

range of ADHD symptoms. We aimed to determine specific time points when ERP

110

activity was associated with hyperactive/impulsive and inattention symptoms that are

111

characteristic of with ADHD. We analysed the data continuously using regression and

112

tested for both linear and curvilinear associations between ADHD symptoms and ERP

113

activity. Findings revealed that hyperactive/impulsive and inattention symptoms were

114

associated with reduced ERP activity during different stages of reward processing.

the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV, which was used to check for

126

symptoms of psychosis, mood disorder, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, suicidality, eating

Thirty-four participants with a previous diagnosis of ADHD were recruited as

well-matched in terms of age, sex and years of education (Table 1). ADHD symptom

133

severity at the time of testing was established using the long form of the self-reported

134

Connors Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS). Based on the CAARS DSM symptom

135

subscale of the CAARS, a t-score of ³ 65 is recommended as a threshold for clinically

136

significant symptoms. Using this criterion, eight participants without a diagnosis of

137

ADHD reported clinically significant symptoms at the time of testing. Conversely, six

138

participants with a diagnosis of ADHD did not to reach the clinical threshold for ADHD

139

at the time of testing (see Figure 1). Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and inattentive

symptoms were also indexed using the DSM subscales provided by the long form

CAARS (Figure 1; Table 1).

E-MID Task

163

The full testing protocol is described in the Supplementary Materials.

164

Participants sat in a dark, sound-attenuated room, 1.05 m from a CRT monitor (75 Hz

165

refresh rate; visual angle of 5.4° horizontally and 5.6° vertically). Stimuli appeared in

166

the middle of the screen.

167

At the beginning of each e-MID trial, a coloured square was presented for 250

168

ms (Figure 2). A reward cue (green square) signalled the potential to win 20 c. A loss

169

cue (red square) signalled the potential to lose 20 c. A neutral cue (blue square)

170

signalled that neither a reward nor loss was possible. This established an incentive

171

anticipation stage. A blank inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was then displayed for 2000-

172

2500 ms (randomly, using a uniform distribution), followed by a target (white star) for

173

160-250 ms (the response interval). Participants were instructed to respond to the

174

target as quickly as possible with their left or right index finger via a response pad. An

177

hits more difficult) and lengthened if the success rate was below 66% (making hits

178

more achievable) (see Supplemental Materials; Table S2). Feedback was presented

179

for 1500 ms after target offset (i.e., the incentive delivery stage). Response hits on

180

reward trials produced a text reading “20 c” in green font (i.e., reward delivery).

181

Response misses on reward trials produced a sad emoticon (i.e., reward-omission:

182

~33% of trials). Response misses on loss trials produced a message reading ‘-20 c’ in

183

red front (i.e., loss delivery: ~33% of trials). Response hits on the loss trials produced

184

a happy emoticon (i.e., loss-omission). Hits and misses on the neutral trials produces

185

a happy and sad emoticon, respectively (i.e., non-monetary outcomes). Here,

186

participants were told that although they would receive feedback about the speed of

187

their response, they could neither win nor lose money. Thirty practice trials were

(ROIs). This was accomplished by calculating the mean across clusters of electrode

220

channels (31): namely, fronto-polar (FPz, FP1, FP2, AF3, AF4), left fronto-lateral (AF7,

221

F5, F7), right fronto-lateral (AF8, F6, F8), fronto-central (FCz, Cz, FC1, FC2, C1, C2),

222

occipital-medial (Oz, POz, O1, O2, PO3, PO4), left posterior-lateral (CP5, CP9, P5,

223

P7, P9) and right posterior-lateral (CP8, CP10, P6, P8, P10). Cue-P3 and FB-P3

224

amplitudes are maximal at posterior electrode channels (15, 20-22); therefore, three

225

posterior-scalp ROIs were generated (i.e., occipital-medial, left and right posterior-

226

lateral). CNV and FRN amplitudes are maximal at fronto-central electrode channels;

227

therefore, four frontal-scalp ROIs were generated (i.e., fronto-polar, fronto-central, left

228

and right fronto-lateral) (15, 20-22). Finally, a 20 Hz high pass filter was applied to

229

each signal.

230

Analysis strategy. For each participant, anticipation stage ERP epochs

231

consisted of 1126 sample points (i.e. -200 ms until 2000 ms) for each incentive

232

condition (i.e. reward-cue, loss-cue and neutral-cue). Delivery stage ERP epochs

233

consisted of 870 sample points (i.e. -200 until 1500 ms) for each incentive condition

234

(i.e. reward-hit, loss-hit and neutral-hit). These data were analysed using an approach

235

that isolated when incentive-related ERP activity was associated with ADHD

236

symptoms. At each time (or sample) point, a regression model was calculated wherein

the correlation between ERP activity and ADHD symptoms was estimated.

238

Hyperactive/impulsive or inattentive symptoms were separately examined. Target

239

(symptom scores) and predictor (ERP activity) variables were all transformed to z-

240

scores.

241

A linear and curvilinear association between the predictors and ADHD

242

symptoms was tested in each regression model (Figure 3). The u-shaped association

243

was estimated by squaring the ERP z-scored values. As a consequence, positive beta

244

values indicate a typical-u-shaped association between ERP activity and symptoms

245

scores. Conversely, negative beta values indicate an inverted-u-shaped association

246

between ERP activity and symptoms scores (Figure 3).

247

education were added as nuisance covariates. Also, we included ERP activity during

248

the neutral condition to control for any fundamental association between ADHD and

249

e-MID task performance. Covariates were also transformed to z-scores. Thus, the

250

model calculated at each time point was as follows:

Figure 3. Possible associations between ADHD symptoms and incentive-related EEG activity
based on simulated data. Within each regression model, terms were included to estimate a
linear (solid lines; ERP) or curvilinear (dashed lines; ERP2) association. A positive beta value
indicates that the linear association was positive going (black-solid lines) or that the curvilinear
association was typical-u-shaped (black-dashed lines). A negative beta value indicates that
the linear association was negative going (grey-solid lines) or that the curvilinear association
was inverted-u-shaped (grey-dashed lines).

271

Statistical significance. The statistical significance of the regression model

272

terms was determined using two methods. First, we used a maximum statistic

273

approach that involved the generation of random permutation models. That is, for

274

every ROI, 1000 null models were also calculated by randomly shuffling the EEG

275

predictors across participants before re-calculating the regression model. This created

276

a set of 7000 null models at each time point (1,000 null models x 7 ROIs). Pooling all

277

7000 null models together allowed us to correct for multiple comparisons across ROIs

278

by identifying values that exceeded the bottom 2.5 or top 97.5 percentile of null

279

distribution. This method was applied to (1) identify ROIs in which the R squared (R2)

280

value was significantly greater than chance and (2) identify significant beta value within

281

each model.

282

The second approach used to determine statistical significance was based the

283

number of contiguous time points where a model term exceeded the maximum

284

statistical significance threshold. If the maximum statistic approach revealed a

285

significant finding (e.g. R2 term or beta value that passed its threshold), then the

286

number of contiguous significant time points (x) was counted. This total was described

287

in terms of the probability of it appearing in all 7000 null models. That is, P(number of

288

null models featuring x contiguous samples | number of null models). We referred to

289

this as ‘contiguous p’.

290

Statistical tests were carried out separately for the anticipation and delivery

291

stages of ERP activity. Tests were calculated using MATLAB (Version 9.1, Natick,

292

Massachusetts, US: The MathWorks Inc.). Data and processing scripts are available

online (https://osf.io/k4hqz/).

For two participants, more than 50% of trials were rejected due to poor quality.

299

These participants were excluded from further analysis (see Supplemental Materials).

The R2 values and beta values for each EEG-related term at each ROI are presented

301

in Supplementary Materials. Only the significant effects are described below. Figures

302

4 and 7 illustrate the averaged ERP activity for the anticipation stage

303

(impulsive/hyperactivity and inattentive symptoms, respectively). Figures 6 and 9

304

illustrate the averaged ERP activity for the delivery stage (impulsive/hyperactivity and

305

inattentive symptoms, respectively). Detailed results from each scalp ROI are

306

described in Supplementary Materials. This includes the association between

307

hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and ERP activity during (i) the anticipation (Figures

308

S1-S7) and (ii) delivery stage (Figure S8-S14). Also included is the association

309

between inattention symptoms and ERP activity during (iii) the anticipation stage

310

(Figures S15-S21) and (iv) delivery stage (Figure S22-S28). Below, we discuss the

311

findings from scalp ROIs where the R2 value surpassed the critical R2 threshold.

Hyperactive/impulsive

313

Anticipation Stage. Based on the maximum statistic approach, the critical R2

314

threshold over the entire epoch was around 0.20 ± 0.005 (M ± SD). In addition, the

315

probability of observing two (or more) consecutives samples with a significant R2 value

316

was less than one in every 7000 models. Using these criteria, ERP activity from 3 (of

317

scalp ROIs was significantly associated with hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (Figure

318

319

occipital-medial and right posterior lateral ROIs (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were significantly associated with incentive-related ERP
activity at 3 scalp ROIs during the anticipation stage (left hand side). Significant periods are illustrated by
coloured vertical bars in each panel; these coloured bars correspond to the contiguously significant R2
values (also in Figure 4). Further analysis revealed that only certain incentive conditions were associated
with hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms at each scalp ROI. (A) At the posterior-lateral left ROI, the
association between ERP activity and symptoms was driven by the reward-cue (linear association with
symptoms). (B) At the occipital-medial ROI, the association between ERP activity and symptoms was
driven by the loss-cue (curved association). (C) At the posterior-lateral right ROI, the association between
ERP activity and symptoms was driven by the reward-cue (curved association). Statistical significance
was based on the contiguous beta values (coloured dotted lines) that exceeded the bottom 2.5 or top
97.5 percentile of the corresponding beta values from all (7000) null models (i.e. the bthreshold; the grey
dotted line). Also illustrated are the p-values that corresponds to the beta values. These are presented
in blue at the bottom of each panel. We applied the maximum statistic approach to these values to identify
p-values that exceeded the top 97.5 percentile of the corresponding p values from all null models (i.e. a
p threshold; the blue dotted line). This value was log transformed so that higher values trended towards
statistical significance: where p = .05, -log10(p) = 1.30; where p = .01, -log10(p) = 2; where p = .001, log10(p) = 3.

Discussion

397

Reward processing in adult ADHD was explored using the e-MID task. We

398

investigated when, and how, incentive-related ERP activity was associated ADHD

399

symptom dimensions (i.e. hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptoms).

400

Specifically, we examined event-related potential (ERP) components that are

401

assumed to reflect brief neuro-cognitive mechanisms involved in the processing,

402

storage and retrieval of reward-relevant information (e.g., cue detection, motor-

403

response preparation and outcome evaluation (19, 21)).

404

We first investigated associations between incentive-related ERP activity and

405

hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. Cue-P3 amplitudes are linked to early top-down

406

processes including attentional allocation (15, 20-22) as well as the updating of working

407

memory in response to new stimuli (19). Motivationally salient cues exert greater

408

demands on top-down processing and this is reflected by higher cue-P3 amplitude

409

(especially for reward cues) (19, 23). In this study, we found a negative association

410

414

reward anticipation. If the transfer of brain activity from rewards to their predictive cues

415

is diminished (i.e., impaired reward anticipation), then predictive cues will place fewer

416

demands on top-down processing. As a result, lower cue-P3 potentiation in response

417

to reward-cues would be expected. Importantly, an attentional deficit cannot explain

418

these findings, because cue-P3 amplitudes in response to neutral cues were not

419

significantly associated with symptoms any point in time.

420

CNV amplitudes in response to reward and loss-cues were significantly

421

associated with hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (around 1500 ms post cue; medial

422

and right posterior-lateral scalp). The relationship between reward-related CNV

423

amplitudes and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms was typical-u-shaped. It is important

424

to note that greater negativity in CNV amplitudes reflects greater motor-response

425

preparation. A typical-u-shaped relation therefore indicates that the extreme ends of

426

hyperactive/impulsive symptoms are associated with smaller CNV amplitudes – that

427

is, poorer motor-response preparation. Interestingly, the opposite pattern was

428

observed for loss-related CNV amplitudes. The association between loss-related CNV

429

amplitudes and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms was an inverted-u-shape. These

430

findings suggest, in the context of motor-response preparation, that the extreme ends

431

of hyperactive/impulsive symptoms are characterised not only by a hyposensitivity to

432

potential rewards but also a hypersensitivity to potential losses. To our knowledge, our

433

study is the first to report this outcome.

434

We also investigated the relationship between incentive-related ERP activity

435

and inattentive symptoms. CNV amplitudes during reward anticipation were

436

associated with inattentive symptoms. Again, this relationship was u-shaped,

437

suggesting that ADHD symptoms in general are linked to disruptions in incentive-

438

related motor response preparation. Specifically, the extreme ends of ADHD

439

symptomology are associated with hypoactive ERP activity in response to reward-

440

cues during motor response preparation.

441

Inattention, but not hyperactive/impulsive symptoms, was associated with

442

atypical ERP activity following the delivery of a reward. Specifically, there was a

443

negative association between early ERP amplitudes and inattention (around 250 ms,

444

fronto-central scalp ROI). Recent findings suggest that ERPs at this time and scalp

445

space reflect reward-specific activation elicited from striatal reward regions. This has

446

been referred to as a reward positivity (RewP) component, which positively increases

447

in response to relative gains (24, 25). For example, Becker and colleagues

448

demonstrated higher ERP positive amplitudes for reward relative to loss and neutral

449

outcomes (32). Furthermore, reward-related positivity was specifically associated with

450

a relative increase in VS, mid-cingulate and mid-frontal cortices [34]. While the exact

451

cognitive significance of the RewP component is unclear, its sensitivity to reward

452

outcomes appears to reflect some an aspect of evaluative (or motivational) processing

453

(19). Following on from this, our findings suggest that inattention symptoms, in the

454

context ADHD, are associated with a disruption in the evaluative processing of reward-

455

specific outcomes.

456

In the current study, ADHD symptom dimensions were associated with specific

457

neuro-cognitive

sensitivities

during

reward

processing.

Increased

458

hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were associated with hypoactive ERP activity in

459

response to reward-predictive cues; this was evident during initial deployment of

460

attentional resources in the anticipation stage. Increased inattention symptoms were

461

associated with hypoactive ERP activity in response to reward outcomes; this was

462

evident during evaluative processing of outcomes in the delivery stage. Both symptom

dimensions were associated with atypical motor-response preparation in response to

464

incentive cues. These findings cannot be explained by a general attentional deficit

465

during task engagement because ERP activity in response to neutral cues was not

466

associated with ADHD symptom dimensions.

467

Our findings differ from the only other investigation of reward processing in

468

ADHD using the e-MID task. Chronaki and colleagues (15) analysed data from 20

469

adolescents with ADHD and 26 comparisons, and observed higher cue-P3 amplitude

470

for reward cues in ADHD relative to comparisons. Their finding suggests that reward

471

anticipation is hypersensitive in ADHD. Although the precise reason for these

472

contradicting results is unclear, there are some methodological differences between

473

our and their study. For example, the groups reported in our study are larger and were

474

matched in terms of age, sex, education and IQ. Another key difference between the

475

two studies was the data analysis strategy. Chronaki and colleagues examined

476

between-groups differences in ERP amplitudes at specific ERP time windows. These

477

times were validated through previous research (20). Our analysis was more ‘data-

478

driven’, whereby significant associations between ERP activity and symptoms were

479

extracted across contiguous sample point. Our approach affords a considerable

480

degree of temporal resolution, which may have allowed us to better disentangle the

481

component processes of reward processing and observe novel associations with

482

symptoms. A final difference between the studies was that we examined the

483

association between ERP activity and ADHD symptoms continuously, across the

484

entire sample, rather than between groups (also see (33)). The current approach is

485

therefore commensurate with the emerging view that psychiatric symptoms are

486

dimensional, rather than categorical constructs, with functional impairment occurring

487

at the extreme ends (34, 35).

488

Some etiological models suggest that ADHD symptoms result from diminished

489

brain activity during reward anticipation (6, 36, 37). If not effectively anticipated, future

490

rewards are less likely to influence immediate actions and decisions. This insensitivity

491

to rewards may manifest as impulsive behavioural traits, including a bias towards

492

larger and more immediate rewards, as well as poorer planning and self-regulation.

493

These models therefore predict irregular brain activity in reward networks during the

494

anticipation stage. Most studies rely on MID tasks with fMRI and, in healthy individuals,

495

increased VS activation is observed during reward relative to neutral cue anticipation

496

(14, 38-40). Adolescent and adult ADHD, in comparison, has been characterized by

497

VS hypoactivity in response to reward-predictive cues (10, 11). These studies also

498

report a negative association between VS activation and impulsive symptoms in

499

ADHD. However, others have found no evidence of abnormal brain activity during

500

reward anticipation in ADHD. For example, Stoy and colleagues observed significant

501

VS activation during reward anticipation but no differences between adult ADHD and

502

comparisons (17). Paloyelis and colleagues also demonstrated that VS activation

503

during reward anticipation did not differ between an adult ADHD group and

504

comparisons (16). Also, von Rhein and colleagues observed an increase in VS

505

activation during reward anticipation but no differences between a large group of

506

adolescents and adults with ADHD versus comparisons (18).

507

Although our analysis was ERP-based, the results are relevant to the previous

508

functional neuroanatomy literature. Pfabigan and colleagues administered a MID task

509

to healthy individuals twice, first with fMRI and again with EEG (22). They reported a

510

positive association between reward-related cue-P3 amplitudes and reward-related

511

VS activation, but no association between CNV amplitudes and VS activation. In this

512

study, posterior cue-P3 and CNV amplitudes in response to rewards were atypical in

513

cases of elevated impulsivity. Therefore, the negative association between reward-

514

related cue-P3 amplitudes and impulsivity may reflect VS hypoactivity during reward

515

anticipation in ADHD. As such, our study supports previous evidence of lower VS

516

activity during reward-anticipation in ADHD (9-11, 41, 42). The current findings also

517

contribute to the literature by demonstrating an association between inattentive

518

symptoms and hypo-sensitivity to rewards during evaluative processing of outcomes.

519

A limitation of the current study is that we cannot speak to the causal

520

connections between different neuro-cognitive mechanisms. One possibility is that a

521

weaker allocation of attentional resources to reward cues during the anticipation stage

522

(a correlate of impulsivity) is a consequence of the inefficient evaluation of reward

523

outcomes during the delivery stage (a correlate of inattention). However, the reverse

524

could also be true. For example, an ‘aversion-of-delay’ model of ADHD posits that

525

deficits in the ability to anticipate rewards will accrue inattentive symptoms across

526

development (36, 37). To parse these causal connections, future research will benefit

527

from larger group sizes with a community sample that includes participants who are

In conclusion, hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptoms are associated

531

with hyposensitivity to rewards during the anticipation and delivery stage. Increased

532

hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were associated with hypoactive ERP activity in

533

response to reward-predictive cues; this was evident around the time of a cue-P3

component. Increased inattention symptoms were associated with hypoactive ERP

535

component. Finally, when anticipating rewards and losses, CNV amplitudes were
