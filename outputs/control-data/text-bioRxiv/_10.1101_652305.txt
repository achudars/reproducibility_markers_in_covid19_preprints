Abstract

26

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induces ischemia characterized by a densely ischemic

27

focus, and a less densely ischemic penumbral zone in which neurons and astrocytes display age-

28

dependent dynamic variations in spontaneous Ca2+ activities. However, it is unknown whether

29

penumbral nerve cells respond to sensory stimulation early after stroke onset, which is critical for

30

understanding stimulation-induced stroke therapy. In this study, we investigated the ischemic

31

penumbra’s capacity to respond to somatosensory input. We examined adult (3- to 4-month-old)

32

and old (18- to 24-month-old) male mice at 2–4 hours after MCAO, using two-photon microscopy

33

to record somatosensory stimulation-induced neuronal and astrocytic Ca2+ signals in the ischemic

34

penumbra. In both adult and old mice, MCAO abolished spontaneous and stimulation-induced

35

electrical activity in the penumbra, and strongly reduced stimulation-induced Ca2+ responses in

36

neuronal somas (35–82%) and neuropil (92–100%) in the penumbra. In comparison, after stroke,

37

stimulation-induced astrocytic Ca2+ responses in the penumbra were only moderately reduced (by

38

54–62%) in adult mice, and were even better preserved (reduced by 31–38%) in old mice.

39

Our results suggest that somatosensory stimulation evokes astrocytic Ca2+ activity in the ischemic

40

penumbra. We hypothesize that the relatively preserved excitability of astrocytes, most prominent

41

in aged mice, may modulate protection from ischemic infarcts during early somatosensory

42

activation of an ischemic cortical area. Future neuroprotective efforts in stroke may target

43

spontaneous or stimulation-induced activity of astrocytes in the ischemic penumbra.

Introduction

47

Stroke patients experience extensive sensory and tactile stimulation during transport and critical

48

care. Experimental studies show potential beneficial effects of early sensory stimulation of peri-

49

infarct tissue (Lay et al., 2011; 2012; Frostig et al., 2013; Hancock et al., 2013; Lay et al., 2013).

50

However, the results are controversial and the mechanisms underlying stimulation-induced

51

neuroprotection remain elusive (Baron, 2018). Immediately following ischemia, glutamate

52

accumulates at synapses, (Drejer et al., 1985) resulting in extensive stimulation of N-methyl-D-

53

aspartate (NMDA) receptors that can eventually become neurotoxic (Tu et al., 2010; Lai et al.,

54

2014; Chamorro et al., 2016). Unfortunately, little is presently known about astroglial function in

55

the penumbra and in neuroprotection. These cells perform important functions, including

56

neurotransmitter uptake and recycling, (Schousboe, 2018) neurovascular coupling, (Lind et al.,

57

2018) and blood-brain barrier maintenance (Kutuzov et al., 2018). In the current study, we aimed to

58

elucidate the evoked activity of neurons and astroglial cells in the penumbra, to better understand

59

the mechanisms underlying somatosensory stimulation-induced stroke protection.

60

Ischemic strokes are more common among the elderly than in the young population;

61

therefore, translation of preclinical results to clinical stroke requires inclusion of an aged animal

62

group (O'Collins et al., 2006; Dirnagl and Macleod, 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Chisholm and

63

Sohrabji, 2016). Our present study included both adult and aged mice. While electrical signals are

64

silenced in the ischemic penumbra, both neurons and astrocytes produce spontaneous Ca2+ activity.

65

We previously demonstrated that this relies on the preservation of neuronal excitability, which

66

reflects some degree of functional organization (Fordsmann et al., 2018). Importantly, adult mice

67

show reduced spontaneous Ca2+ activities (astrocytic and neuronal), whereas old mice exhibit

68

unchanged spontaneous neuronal Ca2+ activity and abundant astrocytic Ca2+ activity that is

69

modulated by synaptic activity (Fordsmann et al., 2018). Notably, intracellular Ca2+ changes

70

represent biochemical signals and are not reflected in electrical signals.

71

Here we examined the possibility that somatosensory stimulation evoked neuronal and

72

astrocytic Ca2+ responses in the ischemic penumbra despite electrical silence. We examined adult

73

and old male mice at 2–4 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), using a

74

combination of two-photon Ca2+ imaging, laser speckle imaging of cerebral blood flow, and

75

electrophysiological recordings. In both adult and old mice, stroke strongly reduced stimulation-

76

induced Ca2+ responses in neurons, while stimulation-induced astrocytic Ca2+ responses were

77

preserved. This suggests that somatosensory stimulation of the electrically silent ischemic

78

penumbra induced increased astrocyte Ca2+ within a time-window that is relevant for early stroke

79

therapy.

Materials and Methods

83

Animal Handling

84

This study included 42 male C57Bl/6 mice (Janvier labs): 21 adult and 21 old. In each mouse, the

85

trachea was cannulated for mechanical ventilation (SAAR-830; CWE), and a catheter was inserted

86

into the left femoral artery to monitor blood pressure and blood gases. Another catheter was placed

87

in the femoral vein for anesthetic infusion (α-chloralose). To ensure that the mice were maintained

88

under physiological conditions, we continuously monitored end-expiratory CO2 (Capnograph type

89

340; Harvard Apparatus) and blood pressure (Pressure Monitor BP-1; World Precision

90

Instruments). Arterial blood gases were repeatedly measured (PO2, 95–110 mmHg; PCO2, 35–40

91

mmHg; pH, 7.35–7.45; ABL 700Series Radiometer). Body temperature was maintained at 37°C

using a rectal temperature probe and a heating blanket (Model TC-1000 Temperature Controller;

93

CWE).

94

All procedures involving animals were approved by the Danish National Ethics Committee

95

(#2014-15-0201-00027), and were performed in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the

96

European Council’s Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and

97

Other Scientific Purposes, and in compliance with the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo

98

Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines.

99

Part of the dataset for the 42 mice examined by two-photon microscopy imaging has

100

previously been described (Fordsmann et al., 2018). In our previously published study, we report

101

spontaneous Ca2+ changes using a different analytical method than in the present study. We did not

102

previously describe stimulation-induced changes in Ca2+ signaling, and the reported two-photon

103

imaging data do not overlap between the two manuscripts.

104
105

Anesthesia

106

Anesthesia was induced with intraperitoneal bolus injections of the α2-adrenergic-receptor agonist

107

xylazine (10 mg kg−1) and the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine (60 mg kg−1). To maintain

108

anesthesia during surgery, we administered supplemental doses of ketamine (30 mg kg−1/20 min).

109

Anesthesia level was assessed by testing the motor response to a hind-limb pinch. For the duration

110

of the experiment, the mice were supplied with NaHCO3 (200 mM, 0.15 ml/2 h, i.p.) to prevent

111

metabolic acidosis and declining blood pressure. Upon completion of all surgical procedures,

112

anesthesia was switched to continuous intravenous infusion with α-chloralose (25 mg/kg/h, i.v.)

113

(Figure 1).

114

During surgical procedures, Xylazine provides analgesia and sedation however, it has substantial

115

systemic effects on blood pressure and respiration. Ketamine does not effect the respiratory system

but diminishes neurological responses due to NMDA-receptor antagonism (Hildebrandt et al.,

117

2008). Both compounds are rapidly metabolized and fully excreted via the kidney and the liver. On

118

the other hand, the specific pharmacological effects of α-chloralose are not fully elucidated but

119

likely involve the GABAergic inhibitory system (Garrett and Gan, 1998). Due to its ability to

120

preserve neurovascular coupling (neuronal activity and CBF responses) better than other

121

anaesthetics, α-chloralose is traditionally used in Neuroscience (Lindauer et al., 1993; Bonvento et

122

al., 1994; Austin et al., 2005; Sumiyoshi et al., 2012).

124

Surgery

125

In our experimental set-up, the skull was glued to a metal plate using cyanoacrylate gel (Loctite

126

Adhesives). One craniotomy was drilled for MCAO. Next, we drilled a second craniotomy with a

127

diameter of ∼4 mm, centered 0.5 mm behind and 3 mm to the right of the bregma, over the sensory

128

barrel cortex region. After careful removal of the dura mater, anesthesia was switched to α-

129

chloralose. The preparation was covered with 0.75% agarose in saline (type III-A, low EEO;

130

Sigma-Aldrich), and then moistened with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; NaCl 120 mM, KCl

131

2.8 mM, NaHCO3 22 mM, CaCl2 1.45 mM, Na2HPO4 1 mM, MgCl2 0.876 mM, glucose 2.55 mM;

132

pH = 7.4) The craniotomy was partly covered with a glass coverslip that permitted electrode

133

insertion for dye loading and neuronal activity recording (Fordsmann et al., 2018).

134
135

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion

136

The mice were randomly assigned to either the sham control or MCAO groups. In the stroke

137

groups, a small craniotomy was drilled over the distal part of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The

138

dura mater was removed, and the craniotomy was immediately moistened with aCSF and kept

139

moistened during baseline laser speckle imaging (LSI) of cerebral blood flow (CBF). The MCA

140

was electro-coagulated at the distal trunk using bipolar forceps coupled to an electrosurgical unit

141

(Bipolar coagulator GN060; Aesculap). MCAO was confirmed by visual inspection through the

142

surgical microscope and by LSI (Fordsmann et al., 2018). In the sham control group, a small

143

craniotomy was drilled, but the MCA was left intact. Arterial blood gases were monitored and kept

144

constant (PO2, 95–110 mmHg; PCO2, 35–40 mmHg; pH, 7.35–7.45; ABL 700Series Radiometer)

145

during MCAO.

146
147

Cerebral Blood Flow Monitoring by Laser Speckle Imaging

148

To validate our stroke model and identify ischemic areas in mice subjected to permanent MCAO,

149

we monitored CBF with LSI (MoorFLPI; Moor Instruments) before, during, and at 10 min after

150

MCAO, as well as in sham control mice, as previously described (Fordsmann et al., 2018). Images

151

were acquired at 1 frame per second, and were processed offline using custom-made software

152

(Python 2.7). In stroke mice, we defined the penumbra as an area where CBF was decreased to 20–

153

50% of pre-stroke values, and we defined an ischemic core by a drop to below 20% of pre-stroke

154

values (Fordsmann et al., 2018). LSI recordings ensured the performance of two-photon microscopy

155

imaging in areas that showed an initial CBF decrease corresponding to the ischemic penumbra.

156

CBF was stable during LSI recordings in both adult sham and old sham controls, in which the MCA

157

was untouched (Fordsmann et al., 2018). The ischemic core and penumbra sizes, and the relative

158

decrease of CBF, were independent of age suggesting equivalent initial CBF reductions across all

159

MCAO groups (Fordsmann et al., 2018).

160
161

Whisker Pad Stimulation

162

Stimulations were performed 2–3 hours after stroke or sham intervention. To activate the mouse

163

sensory barrel cortex, we percutaneously inserted a set of custom-made bipolar electrodes, and

164

stimulated the contralateral ramus infraorbitalis of the trigeminal nerve (Norup Nielsen and

165

Lauritzen, 2001). The cathode was positioned corresponding to the hiatus infraorbitalis, while the

166

anode was inserted into the masticatory muscles. Stimulation was administered using an ISO-flex

167

stimulation isolator (A.M.P.I., Israel), controlled by a sequencer file running within the Spike2

168

software version 7.02 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Stimulation

169

was applied for 0.1 ms with 1.5 mA in 15-s trains at 1, 2, and 5 Hz, with each train repeated twice.

170
171

Electrophysiology

172

To record extracellular local field potentials (LFPs), we used a single-barreled glass micropipette

173

filled with aCSF, along with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1/AM (OGB) and

174

the astrocyte-specific marker sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) (Lind et al., 2013). The Ag/AgCl ground

175

electrode was positioned in the neck muscles while the recording electrode was inserted into the

176

whisker barrel cortex (layer 2/3) and left untouched until the end of the experiments. All

177

electrophysiological recordings were done in the ischemic penumbral area comprising layer 2/3

178

whisker barrel cortex. The signal was initially amplified using a differential amplifier (10× gain,

179

0.1–10,000 Hz bandwidth; DP-311 Warner Instruments). Then additional amplification was

180

performed using the CyberAmp 380 (100× gain, 0.1–10,000 Hz bandwidth; Axon Instruments). The

181

electrical signal was digitally sampled at a 5-kHz sampling rate using the 1401 mkII interface

182

(Cambridge Electronic Design) connected to Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). For

183

each stimulation train, we averaged the LFPs, and calculated the amplitudes of excitatory

184

postsynaptic potentials as the difference between baseline and the first negative peak. Arterial blood

185

gases were monitored and kept constant (PO2, 95–110 mmHg; PCO2, 35–40 mmHg; pH, 7.35–7.45;

186

ABL 700Series Radiometer) during electrical recording.

188

Two-Photon Microscopy

189

A glass micropipette (1–3 MΩ impedance; 2-μm tip; World Precision Instruments) was connected

190

to a pneumatic injector (3–20 PSI, 10–90 s; Pneumatic Pump; World Precision Instruments). This

191

set-up was used to load the somatosensory cortex with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Oregon Green Bapta

192

(OGB-AM; Invitrogen) and the astrocyte-specific marker sulforhodamine (SR101; Sigma-Aldrich).

193

OGB was solubilized in 20% pluronic acid and dimethylsulfoxide, and diluted to 0.8 mM in aCSF.

194

SR101 was solubilized in methanol, and diluted to 0.005 mM in aCSF.

195

The same micropipette was also used for electrophysiological recordings. Care was taken to

196

ensure calcium imaging within the ischemic penumbral area that comprised layer 2/3 whisker barrel

197

cortex. LSI recordings ensured the performance of two-photon imaging in areas that showed an

198

initial CBF decrease corresponding to the ischemic penumbra. We conducted in vivo imaging with

199

two-photon microscopes using the Femto3D-RC

200

multiphoton/confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Leica, Germany) equipped with Ti:Sapphire

201

lasers (Spectra-Physics, Sweden). Dye loading was performed under 5× magnification. Time-lapse

202

movies were recorded using a 25× water-immersion objective (1.0 NA; Zeiss) and a 20× water-

203

immersion objective (1.0 NA; Leica). Using an excitation wavelength of 900 nm, we recorded time-

204

lapse movies with a frame size of 256 × 256 pixels (1.43 µm per pixel), and a sampling rate of 2–5

205

Hz (Fordsmann et al., 2018). Evoked Ca2+ activities were recorded at 120–180 min after the

206

intervention. To minimize laser-induced artifacts and photo-toxicity, the laser power was kept

207

between 20–40 mW.

Image Analysis

210

Data were analyzed using a custom-built program written in Matlab. Regions of interest (ROIs)

211

were selected using a modification of the pixel-of-interest-based analysis method (Lind et al.,

9

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/652305; this version posted May 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

212

2018). Rectangular ROIs were positioned around astrocytic somas, astrocytic processes, astrocytic

213

end-feet, neuronal somas, and neuropil. ROIs were defined as either astrocytic or neuronal

214

according to the SR101/OGB-AM double-staining pattern, cell morphology, and relation to blood

215

vessels (Fordsmann et al., 2018). Large processes not visibly connected to a soma were considered

216

astrocytic processes, while processes visibly connected to a soma were included as somatic ROIs.

217

Astrocytic end-feet were identified based on the encircling of vessels. For each frame, we selected

218

pixels showing intensities of 1.5 standard deviations (SD) above the mean intensity of the ROI. The

219

intensities of these pixels were averaged, and then normalized to a 10-s baseline period just before

220

stimulation onset, creating a time trace of ΔF/F0 for every ROI. These time traces were smoothed

221

with a 2-sec moving average to avoid outlier values. An evoked Ca2+ response was defined as an

222

intensity increase of ≥5% and of ≥2 SD from baseline, having a duration of ≥2.5 s, within 60 s after

223

stimulation onset. Responsivity was defined as the fraction of ROIs responding to stimulation, and

224

was reported as the % of responding ROIs among the total number of ROIs. For each ROI, response

225

size was measured as the area under the curve (AUC) during the response, reported as AUC in

226

ΔF/F0 × s.

227
228

Experimental desing and statistical analysis

229

All statistical analyses were performed using RStudio version 1.0.136 (RStudio Team, 2016) with R

230

version 3.3.2, (R Core Team, 2016) using ROIs as the experimental unit. Experimental groups were

231

statistically compared to determine the effects of age, stroke, or pharmacological treatments.

232

Differences in ROI responsivity were tested by multinomial logistic regression (MLR), with

233

treatment and stimulation frequencies as explanatory variables, using the nnet package (Venables

234

and Ripley, 2002). We tested the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials by performing

235

linear mixed-effects modeling (LMER) with post-stroke time, treatment, and stimulation

236

frequencies as fixed effects, and mice as random factors, using the lme4 package (Bates et al.,

237

2015). We also used the lme4 program to assess the relationship between Ca2+ responsivities in

238

different cellular compartments, with cellular compartment as a fixed effect and stimulation

239

frequency as a random factor. Linear models (LM) were used to analyze the AUC of evoked Ca2+

240

increases, with treatment and stimulation frequencies as fixed effects. We used the Holm-Sidak

241

post-hoc test to correct the p values obtained with MLR, LMER, and LM. To ensure normal

242

distribution of residuals, the AUC for evoked Ca2+ increases was log-transformed before statistical

243

analysis, and is presented as the back-transformed estimate ± the 95% confidence interval. The ROI

244

% having evoked responses is presented as fraction ± standard error of probability. All other data

245

are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The significance level was set to α =

246

0.05. Table 1 presents the numbers of mice, ROIs, and responses used for analysis.

Results

249

Focal Ischemia Abolishes Local Field Potentials

250

To determine how stroke affected synaptic excitation, we performed whisker pad stimulation and

251

measured the LFP responses in the contralateral somatosensory cortex, which included the

252

penumbra as indicated by LSI. MCAO abolished LFP responses in adult mice (p = 0.0065, LMER)

253

and old mice (p = 0.0046, LMER; Figure 2 and Table 2).

255

Stroke Strongly Reduces Evoked Neuronal Ca2+ Signals in the Ischemic Penumbra

256

Neurons and astrocytes generally respond to somatosensory stimulation with intensely increased

257

Ca2+ in neuronal somas, neuropil, astrocytic somas, processes, and end-feet (Khennouf et al., 2016;

258

Jessen et al., 2017; Lind et al., 2018; Stobart et al., 2018). Since stroke reduces spontaneous

259

neuronal Ca2+ activity in adult but not aged mice, (Fordsmann et al., 2018) we next assessed how

260

neurons in the electrically silent penumbra reacted to somatosensory stimulation during the early

261

post-stroke period. Excitability was measured in terms of the ability of neurons and astrocytes to

262

exhibit a Ca2+ response to synaptic input, presented as the response fraction, i.e., the number of

263

responding ROIs relative to the overall number of ROIs. We also assessed response size, based on

264

the AUC of the relative change in fluorescence ΔF/F0.

265

Healthy old and adult mice showed similar neuronal soma responsivity and Ca2+ response

266

amplitudes. In adult mice under control conditions, somatosensory stimulation at 1, 2, and 5 Hz

267

produced Ca2+ responses in 22–39% of neuronal somas. Relative to adult sham controls, stroke

268

decreased this actively responding fraction by 66–82% (p < 0.0001, effect of treatment, MLR;

269

Figure 3A–D). Additionally, stroke in adult mice reduced the Ca2+ response size by 34–88% (p =

270

0.0013, effect of treatment; LM, Figure 3E). In old mice, stroke reduced responsivity by 35–69%

271

compared to age-matched sham controls (p = 0.0024, effect of treatment, MLR; Figure 3A–D), and

272

decreased response size by 42–75% (p < 0.0002, effect of treatment, LM; Figure 3E).

273

We also examined the effect of stroke on Ca2+ responsivity and amplitude in the neuropil,

274

i.e., the synaptically dense region between cell bodies that mainly comprises neuronal dendrites,

275

unmyelinated axons, and fine astrocytic processes. Under control conditions, compared to adult

276

mice, old mice showed enhanced neuropil responsivity (p < 0.0001, effect of treatment, MLR;

277

Figure 3A, B, F, G), and larger neuropil Ca2+ response amplitudes (p = 0.0052, effect of treatment,

278

LM; Figure 3H). MCAO abolished neuropil responsivity in adult mice (p < 0.0001, effect of

279

treatment, MLR; Figure 3A, B, F, G) and in old mice (p < 0.0001, effect of treatment, MLR;

280

Figure 3A, B, F, G). Overall, our data indicated that sensory stimulation evoked larger neuropil

281

Ca2+ responses in old mice than adult mice under control conditions, and that stroke reduced

282

neuronal soma responsivity and abolished neuropil Ca2+ responsivity in both adult and aged mice.

Stroke Reduces Astrocytic Ca2+ Responses in Ischemic Penumbra in an Age-Dependent Manner

285

We next examined whether astrocytes in the ischemic penumbra responded to somatosensory

286

stimulation after stroke. Under control conditions, adult and old mice showed similar evoked Ca2+

287

signaling in astrocytic somas, with a fraction of astrocytic somas exhibiting Ca2+ increases in

288

response to sensory stimulation (Figure 4A, B and Figure 5B, C). After stroke, we observed

289

critical age-dependent differences regarding evoked Ca2+ signals in astrocytic somas. In adult mice,

290

stroke reduced the Ca2+ responsivity of astrocytic somas (p = 0.0029, effect of treatment, MLR;

291

Figure 4A, B and Figure 5A, B), without altering the Ca2+ response amplitudes (Figure 5C). In

292

contrast, among old mice, stroke did not reduce the responsivity or Ca2+ response amplitudes of

293

astrocyte somas (p = 0.1098, MLR; and p = 0.1724, LM, respectively; Figure 5B, C). These data

294

suggested that astrocytic soma excitability was more sensitive to stroke in adult mice than in aged

295

mice.

296

Similar to astrocytic somas, under control conditions, sensory stimulation evoked similar

297

Ca2+ signals in the astrocytic processes in the penumbra of both adult and old mice (Figure 5E, F).

298

In adult mice, stroke reduced astrocytic process responsivity by 50–82% (p = 0.0001, effect of

299

treatment, MLR; Figure 4A, B and Figure 5D, E) and reduced the Ca2+ response amplitude by 45–

300

77% (p = 0.0071, effect of treatment, LM; Figure 5F). Among old mice, stroke reduced the evoked

301

Ca2+ responsivity in astrocytic processes by only 30–48% (p = 0.0128, effect of treatment, MLR;

302

Figure 4A, B and Figure 5D, E) and did not alter the Ca2+ response amplitude (p = 0.1021, LM;

303

Figure 5F). The results indicated that stimulation-induced Ca2+ signals in astrocytic processes were

304

more susceptible to ischemia in adult mice than old mice.

305

Under control conditions, responsivity in the astrocytic end-feet was slightly higher in aged

306

mice than in adult mice (p = 0.0015, effect of treatment, MLR; Figure 5H), while evoked Ca2+

307

response amplitude did not differ between groups (p = 0.9389, LM). Similar to our findings in

308

astrocytic processes, stroke reduced responsivity in astrocytic end-feet by 58–84% in adult mice (p

309

= 0.0324, effect of treatment, MLR; Figure 4A, B and Figure 5G, H) and by 58–67% in old mice

310

(p < 0.0001, effect of treatment, MLR; Figure 4A, B and Figure 5G, H). Stroke reduced the

311

evoked Ca2+ response size in astrocytic end-feet in adult mice (p = 0.0331; effect of treatment, LM;

312

Figure 5I), but not in old mice (p = 0.1113, effect of treatment, LM; Figure 5I). Overall, stroke

313

reduced the responsivity of Ca2+ responses in astrocytic end-feet in both adult and old mice, and

314

reduced the Ca2+ response amplitudes in astrocytic end-feet only in adult mice.

315
316

Relationship between Astrocytic and neuronal Ca2+ activity is disrupted by stroke

317

The decreased astrocytic responsivity after stroke may suggest a relationship between local evoked

318

neuronal and astrocytic Ca2+ activity. To examine this relationship, we performed mixed models

319

linear regression analysis with neuronal soma Ca2+ responsivity as the independent variable. Among

320

adult sham controls, the Ca2+ responsivity of neuronal somas was significantly related to the

321

responsivity of astrocytic processes, astrocytic end-feet, and neuropil (Table 3). In comparison,

322

stroke in adult mice disrupted the relationship between Ca2+ responsivity of neuronal somas and

323

Ca2+ responsivity of astrocytic processes and end-feet (Table 3). Among old sham controls, the

324

Ca2+ responsivity of neuronal somas was significantly related to the responsivities of astrocytic

325

somas and astrocytic processes. These relationships were also disrupted after stroke in old mice

326

(Table 3). In conclusion, our data suggested that stroke disrupted the relationship between neuronal

327

and astrocytic Ca2+ activity.

Discussion

330

Functional studies in rodents provide evidence that administration of mild sensory stimulation

331

within a critical time window of a few hours after stroke can protect the cortex from impeding

332

ischemic injury, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood, (Lay et al., 2011; 2012; Frostig

333

et al., 2013; Hancock et al., 2013; Lay and Frostig, 2014; von Bornstadt et al., 2018) and additional

334

studies are needed to clarify these findings (Baron, 2018). Here we report that in early stroke, the

335

astrocytic Ca2+ signals in the penumbra were moderately preserved, while electrical potentials and

336

neuronal Ca2+ responses were almost silenced. We speculate that astrocyte activity in the

337

electrically silent penumbra may mechanistically contribute to functional recovery after ischemic

338

stroke.

339

In a recent publication, we demonstrated increased spontaneous astrocytic Ca2+ activity and

340

stroke-resistant spontaneous neuronal Ca2+ activity in the penumbra of old mice, while neuronal and

341

astrocytic spontaneous Ca2+ activity were reduced in adult mice (Fordsmann et al., 2018). In our

342

present study, we found that electrical silence did not exclude stimulation-evoked Ca2+ signaling in

343

the penumbra. These results suggest a mismatch between Ca2+ signaling and electrophysiological

344

signals in the penumbra. Notably, astrocytic Ca2+ signals were better preserved in the penumbra of

345

old mice than adult mice. The exact mechanism underlying these age-dependent effects is unknown,

346

and it remains to be determined whether penumbral astrocytic Ca2+ signals in aged mice are

347

adaptive, beneficial, or damaging. Stroke predominantly occurs in elderly people, and age strongly

348

influences patient outcomes after stroke; however, most preclinical studies have been performed in

349

young animals, and thus have less translational potential than data from an aged experimental group

350

(Liu et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010; Manwani and McCullough, 2011; Selvamani et al., 2014).

351

Astrocytes may positively or negatively influence tissue survival depending on their phenotype,

352

which dramatically changes during a life course (Bhat et al., 2012). In old mice, astrocytes

353

transform to a reactive neuroinflammatory phenotype that produces complement components, and

354

releases toxic factors that kill neurons and oligodendrocytes in the uninjured brain (Clarke et al.,

355

2018). During ischemia, this astrocyte phenotype is likely to change to also express ischemia-

15

356

induced genes (Clarke et al., 2018). It may be possible to enhance neuroprotection by blocking

357

astrocyte conversion to the inflammatory or ischemic phenotype, (Yun et al., 2018) but additional

358

studies are needed to examine this possibility.

359

Few prior studies have examined astrocytic Ca2+ signaling in vivo in the penumbra. Reports

360

describe increased astrocytic Ca2+ in association with large spontaneous Ca2+ waves, reminiscent of

361

cortical spreading depolarization waves, during the first 1–1.5 hours after vascular occlusion (Ding

362

et al., 2009; Rakers and Petzold, 2017). Exposure to mild sensory stimulation may also elicit

363

cortical depolarization waves at later times in susceptible cortical regions, (von Bornstadt et al.,

364

2015) but this was not observed in our present study. Even in the absence of cortical spreading

365

depolarization waves, the ischemic penumbra is electrically silenced due to low blood flow, (Astrup

366

et al., 1977) as was evident in our adult and old mice. Consistent with previous findings, our present

367

results support that neurons are more sensitive to ischemia than astrocytes, since stroke abolished

368

all types of neuronal Ca2+ activity in both young and old mice, but did not abolish astrocyte activity

369

(Duffy and MacVicar, 1996; Brown, 2004).

370

Studies using genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators have detected spontaneous and evoked

371

Ca2+ signals in fine processes around synapses, which exhibit spatial and temporal variation

372

(Shigetomi et al., 2016; Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018). The exact function of Ca2+ signals in

373

each of these microdomains is still being investigated. In our present study, we did not assess Ca2+

374

signals from finer astrocytic branches because these branches cannot be labeled with organic dyes.

375

On the other hand, compared to genetically encoded dyes, organic dyes label a greater portion of

376

astrocytes, and our Ca2+ signals mainly stemmed from astrocyte somas, thick processes, and end-

377

feet. The low SR101 concentration (≤50 μM) used in our study did not induce seizure activity,

378

which has been observed in other studies (Kang et al., 2010; Rasmussen et al., 2016). In our sham

379

controls, the responsivity of astrocyte somas, processes, and end-feet to stimulation was similar

380

across structures, consistent with previous findings (Gu et al., 2018).

381

We identified a significant correlation between evoked neuronal and astrocytic Ca2+ signals

382

in control mice, which was disrupted after stroke in both adult and old mice. These findings suggest

383

that stroke interrupts neuronal control over astrocytic Ca2+ signaling, Ischemia-induced energy

384

depletion may result in the release of glutamate, GABA, and ATP, which may affect Ca2+ signaling

385

and interactions between astrocytes and neurons in the penumbra (Fellin et al., 2004; Wang et al.,

386

2006; Attwell et al., 2010).

387

In summary, here we used in vivo two-photon microscopy to measure the cytosolic Ca2+

388

responses evoked by physiological stimulation in the penumbra of adult and old mice. We report

389

that moderately preserved astrocytic Ca2+ responses may modulate the neuroprotective effect of

390

sensory stimulation in early stroke. Moreover, astrocytic Ca2+ signals were better preserved in old

391

than in young adult mice. Modulation of astrocyte activity may be considered in future

392

neuroprotective strategies.

FIGURE 1: Diagram of the experimental timeline. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)

563

was induced during laser speckle imaging (LSI) of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Extracellular local

564

field potentials (LFPs) were recorded using a single-barreled glass micropipette that contained the

565

Ca2+-sensitive dye Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1/AM (OGB) and the astrocyte-specific marker

566

sulforhodamine 101 (SR101).

570

all stimulation frequencies (1 Hz, p < 0.0001; 2 Hz, p = 0.0005; 5 Hz, p = 0.0207). Data are shown

Representative smoothed traces of ΔF/F0 from neuronal ROIs (C) and neuropil ROIs (F), upon

585

stimulation at 2 Hz for 15 s, from adult sham (green), adult MCAO (red), old sham (blue), and old

586

MCAO (purple) mice. (D) Compared to age-matched sham controls, stroke reduced the evoked

587

neuronal soma responsivity in adult mice (2 Hz, p = 0.0006) and old mice (2 Hz, p = 0.0291).

588

Responsivity is given as the fraction of responsive (resp.) ROIs relative to the total number of ROIs.

589

(E) Compared to in age-matched sham controls, the evoked Ca2+ response area under the curve

590

(AUC; ΔF/F0 × s) was reduced by 34–83% in the neuronal somas of adult and old mice after stroke.

591

(G) Compared to age-matched sham controls, stroke reduced neuropil responsivity in adult mice (1

592

Hz, p = 0.0028; 5 Hz, p = 0.0080) and old mice (5 Hz, p < 0.0001). (H) Evoked neuropil Ca2+

593

response AUC (ΔF/F0 × s) during whisker stimulation. Neuropil responsivity and AUC increased

594

with healthy aging. Values are given as the fraction ≤ standard error of probability for responsivity,

595

and back-transformed estimates ± 95% confidence intervals for AUC. MCAO totally abolished

596

evoked Ca2+ responses in neuropil; therefore, the AUC was not examined (NA). Responsivity was

597

analyzed using multinomial logistic regression, and AUC using linear models—both with Holm-

598

615

feet. Responsivity is shown as the fraction of responsive (resp.) regions of interest (ROIs) relative to

616

the total number of ROIs. In adult mice, stroke decreased the responsivity of astrocytic somas,

617

processes, and end-feet. In old mice, stroke only decreased the responsivity of astrocytic processes

618

and end-feet (to a lesser degree than in adult mice). Stroke particularly decreased responsivity at the

619

2-Hz stimulation frequency in astrocytic somas (p = 0.0478; adult sham vs. adult MCAO),

620

astrocytic processes (p = 0.0064; adult sham vs. adult MCAO), and astrocytic end-feet (p = 0.0048;

621

old sham vs. old MCAO). (C, F, I) Size of the evoked Ca2+ response shown as AUC (ΔF/F0 × s) in

astrocytic somas, astrocytic processes, and end-feet. In adult mice, stroke reduced evoked Ca2+

623

response size in astrocytic processes and end-feet. Values are given as fraction ≤ standard error of

probability for responsivity, and as back-transformed estimates ± 95% confidence intervals for

625

AUC. Stroke nearly abolished evoked Ca2+ responses in astrocytic end-feet at stimulation

626

frequencies of 1 and 5 Hz; therefore, AUC was not examined (NA). Responsivity was analyzed
