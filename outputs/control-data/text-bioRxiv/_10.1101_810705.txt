Abstract
Bacteria and their viruses, bacteriophages (phages), are the most abundant components of the
mammalian gut microbiota where these two entities coexist over time. The ecological dynamics
underlying the coexistence between these two antagonistic populations in the gut are unknown. We
challenged a murine synthetic bacterial community with a set of virulent phages, to study the factors
allowing phages-bacteria coexistence in the gut. We found that coexistence was neither dependent
on an arms race between bacteria and phages, nor on the ability of phages to extend host range.
Instead, our data suggest that some phage-inaccessible sites in the mucosa of the ileum serve as a
spatial refuge for bacteria, which from there disseminate in the gut lumen. Luminal phages amplify
by infecting luminal bacteria maintaining phage throughout the gut. We conclude that the
heterogeneous distribution of microbes in the gut contributes to the long-term coexistence of phages
with phage-susceptible bacteria. This observation could explain the persistence in the human gut of
intestinal phages, such as the crAssphage, as well as the low efficiency of oral phage therapy against
enteric pathogens in animal models and clinical trials.

Introduction
The mammalian gut is a highly complex organ, with anatomical differentiation, lined by a variety of
eukaryotic cells types that serve the establishment of a mutualistic relationship between the host
and different enteric microbes, including viruses. Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant
viruses residing in the gut, but their precise role in shaping the microbiome remains unclear
(Manrique et al 2017). Changes in the viral and bacterial communities of the gut are increasingly
reported to be associated with pathological conditions in humans, including diabetes, inflammatory
bowel diseases and colorectal cancer (Hannigan et al 2018b, Manrique et al 2017, Zhao et al 2017).
Although fluctuations in the viral communities have been reported in a recent longitudinal study in
humans, a large proportion of individual-specific viral contigs remain detectable over time,
suggesting that each individual possesses their own viral fingerprint (Manrique et al 2016, Shkoporov
et al 2019). However, how phage and bacteria persist together in the gut remain understudied.
Using phage-bacterial model systems, dynamics of the coexistence of predators (or parasites) and
preys (or hosts) have been the subject of theoretical and experimental studies, mostly performed in
vitro and in silico (Betts et al 2014, Brockhurst et al 2006, Hannigan et al 2018a, Lenski and Levin
1985, Weitz et al 2013). In vivo, the interaction of phages and bacteria in the mammalian gut has
been explored in mice and pigs (Galtier et al 2016, Galtier et al 2017, Looft et al 2014, Maura et al
2012a, Maura et al 2012b, Weiss et al 2009). Studies in mice have shown that virulent phages have a
limited effect on the targeted bacterial populations within the gut (Galtier et al 2017, Maura et al
2012a, Maura et al 2012b, Weiss et al 2009). Likewise, a large randomized phage therapy trial
targeting Escherichia coli diarrhea in Bangladeshi children showed no evidence for in vivo replication
of oral phages in the gut (Sarker et al 2016). Nevertheless, these studies in mice and human showed
that virulent phages, despite their limited impact on the host bacterial population, could persist in
the mammalian gut for several weeks. A similar situation was recently described in the human gut
where the crAssphage coexists with its highly abundant Bacteriodetes bacterial host (Guerin et al
2018, Shkoporov et al 2018, Yutin et al 2018).
Several factors are invoked to understand the coexistence between phages and bacteria, such as
arms race dynamics with resistance development to phage infection and viral counter-resistance, the
inherent or evolved ability of the phage to infect multiple hosts, and the distribution of these two
antagonist populations in structured environments (Brockhurst et al 2006, Doron et al 2018, Galtier
et al 2017, Heilmann et al 2012, Hilborn 1975, Labrie et al 2010). Animal models provided data on
the segmental distribution of phages and bacteria along the length of the gut, but they lack resolution

along the radial dimension (Galtier et al 2017, Maura et al 2012a). In addition, mono-colonized mice
lack aspects of competitive and synergistic interspecies interactions of microbes (Weiss et al 2009).
As an approach to more realistic conditions, we investigated the contribution of factors involved in
the coexistence of phages and bacteria within the gut environment using the synthetic Oligo-MouseMicrobiota comprising 12 distinct strains (OMM12) (Brugiroux et al 2016). This model allows following
defined pairs of phages and bacteria in the gut without the need of antibiotics treatment as a
confounding factor commonly used to study enteric pathogens in vivo (Croswell et al 2009). We
established stable colonization of two E. coli strains in gnotobiotic OMM12 mice and studied the
population dynamics of these strains in the presence of virulent phages. We found that phages were
less abundant in the mucosal part of ileal sections compared to E. coli levels. This observation
provides an explanation for the lack for phage-resistant mutant selection and the limited efficacy of
virulent phages in reducing intestinal bacterial loads.

Results
E. coli strains Mt1B1 and 55989 colonize the gut of OMM12 mice
Mice harbouring the OMM12 consortium (Acutalibacter muris KB18, Akkermansia muciniphila YL44,
Bacteroides caecimuris I48, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. animalis YL2, Blautia coccoides YL58,
Clostridium clostridioforme YL32, Clostridium innocuum I46, Enterococcus faecalis KB1, Flavonifractor
plautii YL31, Lactobacillus reuteri I49, Muribaculum intestinale YL27 and Turicimonas muris YL45)
were orally exposed to the murine commensal E. coli strain Mt1B1 as a first attempt to test the
capacity of an E. coli strain to colonize the gut of OMM12 mice. Mice became colonized within two to
three days, forming a population that remained stable during more than two weeks (Fig. 1A). Mice
did not exhibit signs of discomfort or change in feces consistency. Twelve days after inoculation of
strain Mt1B1, intestinal sections (ileum, cecum, colon) were examined and the location of strain
Mt1B1 was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1). Strain Mt1B1 was
found in all sections of the gut, including the ileum, consistent with the location from which it was
isolated (mucosa from the ileum of conventional laboratory mice) (Garzetti et al 2018, Lagkouvardos
et al 2016). Similar results were obtained with the enteroaggregative E. coli strain 55989, a
pathobiont, demonstrating the flexibility of the OMM12 model to accommodate novel strains (Fig S2).
As previously reported in conventional mice, the gut colonization by strain 55989 did likewise not
result in any sign of gut disease (Maura et al 2012a).

Isolation and characterization of Mt1B1 phages
We isolated and purified 28 phages infecting strain Mt1B1 from four sources of sewage water. The
host-range of these 28 candidates were then characterized, with a panel of 98 different strains of
E. coli. Three phages (P3, P10, P17) were chosen for this study on the basis of their unique host range
(Table S1). All three phages infected strain Mt1B1 in liquid broth. Phages P3 and P10 displayed similar
infection patterns, with rapid lysis followed by a moderate bacterial regrowth at 1.5 hours, whereas
phage P17 halted the growth of strain Mt1B1 for several hours and slow bacterial regrowth resumed
only after more than 10 hours. When used in combination, these three phages caused rapid lysis
followed by very slow regrowth (Fig. 2A).
Phages P3 and P10 had similar affinity constants (5.26x10-10±2.8x10-10mL.min-1 and 4.60x1010±2.15x10-10mL.min-1,

respectively) and adsorption kinetics (90% of phages adsorbed in 2.8 ±0.14

min and 2.03 ±0.19 min, respectively), whereas phage P17 had a stronger affinity for the bacterium
(1.83x10-10±5.60x10-11mL.min-1) but slower adsorption kinetics (5.53 ±1.28 min) (Fig. S3). The

genomes of these three phages were sequenced and analysed. Phage P3 (40.1 kb; 47 ORFs) belong
to Teseptimavirus genus and phage P10 (45.1 kb; 56 ORFs) to Zindervirus genus, both included in the
Autographivirinae subfamily of Podoviridae, whereas phage P17 (150.9 kb; 295 ORFs) is closely
related to phage ESCO13 and belongs to an unclassified subfamily of Myoviridae (Table S2). The
annotation of predicted ORFs revealed an absence of integrases and recombinases homologs, with
57.44%, 75% and 91.53% of ORFs having unknown functions in phages P3, P10 and P17 respectively
(Table S3).
We then assessed the capacity of each phage to replicate in gut sections collected from Mt1B1colonized OMM12 mice, in an ex-vivo assay previously used to demonstrate the differential activities
of phages along the gut (Galtier et al 2017, Maura et al 2012a). We collected samples of the ileum,
cecum and colon from the mice. We then separated out the mucosal and luminal parts of the ileum
and colonic tissues. We compared the replication of the three phages in these ex vivo samples with
in vitro Mt1B1 planktonic cultures, at exponential and stationary growth phases. Similar patterns
were observed for all three phages, with efficient replication in all tested gut sections and in cultures
from exponential phase, while no amplification was observed on cells at stationary phase (Fig. 2B).
We concluded that Mt1B1 cell growth is necessary for amplification of these three phages.
We then investigated the ability of these three phages to infect in vivo the 12 bacteria of the synthetic
OMM12 community, by administering a single oral dose (6x107 PFU) of a mixture of the three phages
(equal amounts of each phage) to OMM12 mice not inoculated with strain Mt1B1. Phage levels in
feces and in some gut sections (cecum and luminal part of the colon) remained low (about 1x104
pfu/g) 24 and 48 hr after administration. In both the luminal and the mucosal sections of the ileum,
and in the mucosal part of the colon, the number of phages was below the threshold of detection
(Fig. S4). This finding indicates that none of the Mt1B1 phages multiplied in vivo on any of the 12
strains within this time interval. These observations are consistent with findings from the
administration of phages to human volunteers or to conventional mice not colonized with the
targeted bacteria (Bruttin and Brussow 2005, Maura et al 2012b, Weiss et al 2009).

A phage cocktail induces a weak but significant reduction in E. coli numbers in the gut
We next investigated how Mt1B1-colonized OMM12 mice responded to an identical oral three-phage
challenge. receiving equal amounts of each of the three phages in a single combined dose of 6x107
PFU would reproduce the long-term coexistence of phages and their target bacterial populations
within the gut. OMM12 mice were fed strain Mt1B1 once by gavage, and colonization was monitored

over nine days. A single dose of the three phages was then administered. Over the following 15 days,
the levels of bacteria and phages in the feces were monitored (Fig. S5). These two populations
coexisted in similar proportions showing that the OMM12 model is suitable to study this coexistence.
Since phages replicate in vivo but did not exert a strong impact on the fecal levels of strain Mt1B1,
we asked whether we could improve this impact by increasing the phage load in repeating the
administration of phages during three consecutive days. Such a setting is approaching a phage
therapy treatment targeting bacterial pathogens residing in the human gut (Corbellino et al 2019). In
two independent experiments, we observed that the group receiving phages displayed on each of
the following three days a decrease in fecal levels of strain Mt1B1 compared to the control group of
mice receiving no phage (Fig. 3A). These two groups of mice are significantly different when
comparing the overall levels of strain Mt1B1 over time (Fig. 3A, p=0.007; TableS4). During the same
period, phage levels remained approximately stable (Fig. 3B). In addition, the similar levels of phages
and of strain Mt1B1 in fecal samples demonstrate that the coexistence of these antagonistic
populations persist despite the repeated application of phages (Fig. 3C).

Phage replication does not trigger shifts in OMM12 bacterial community
We next assessed the stability of the gut microbiota of both phage treated (n=6) and non-treated
(n=5) mice groups by 16S qPCR. This quantification was performed at day0 (before colonization with
the Mt1B1 strain), day14 (before the gavage with phage) and day17 (one day after the third phage
gavage). Changes in the bacterial community were analysed by performing a between-class principal
component analysis (PCA), taking into account days, cages and phage inoculation. Results identified
daily fluctuations as the main source of the observed variations regardless of the presence or absence
of phages (Fig. 3D, Table S5). This finding is also consistent with the lack of amplification of these
phages in OMM12 devoid of E. coli strain Mt1B1 (Fig. S4A) and suggest that the high fecal phage titer
is not the result of the infection of one of the 12 initial strains ruling out a possible off-target
amplification. Moreover, results show that the phage replication on one of the bacterial populations
present in the gut environment does not significantly affect the stability of the remaining bacterial
community, which is consistent with previous reports in the literature (Cieplak et al 2018, Galtier et
al 2016). However, a recent report showed that when some phages provokes >2log reduction of the
level of their targeted bacterial population, perturbation of the remaining bacterial community is
observed in a gnotobiotic mouse model (Hsu et al 2019).

A unique dose of a single phage is sufficient to initiate its coexistence with its host in the gut
Next, we repeated the experiment in OMM12 mice by using E. coli strain 55989 and its virulent phage
CLB_P2 (Maura et al 2012b). A single dose of phage CLB_P2 (1x108 pfu) did not significantly reduce
fecal levels of strain 55989 compared to the control group, while the phage titer remained stable and
around 107 pfu/mL within 3 days (Fig S6). Therefore, the coexistence of phages and bacteria in the
gut was observed with different pairs of phages and bacteria. Altogether our data suggest that factors
limit the impact of phages on E. coli strains. One such factors is the selection of phage resistant
mutants.

Maintenance of bacterial populations is not caused by the emergence of phage-resistant clones
To control for the emergence of phage-resistant E. coli populations, Mt1B1 clones (n=160, 20 from
each of the 8 mice of the short-term experiment; n=120, 24 from each of the 5 mice of the long-term
experiment) and 55989 clones (n=75 to 94, from each of the 6 mice) were isolated from fecal samples
on the last day of the experiment. All Mt1B1 and 55989 clones were susceptible to each of their
respective phages. We also tested for the emergence of phage-resistant clones from several gut
sections (luminal and mucosal parts from ileum and colon, together with cecum samples). All of them
(n=800; 20 colonies from each organ section of the 8 mice of the short-term experiment with strain
Mt1B1; n=75 to 94 colonies from each organ section of the 6 mice with strain 55989) remained
susceptible to each of their respective phages. We can therefore conclude that phage-resistant
clones did not reach the detection threshold, ruling out a major role of coevolutionary dynamics
(arms-race) in the coexistence of virulent phages and bacteria in the gut.

Spatial heterogeneity of the gut can explain phage-bacteria coexistence
In the absence of evidence for off-target phage amplification or emergence of phage-resistant
bacteria, we hypothesized that the spatial heterogeneity of the mammalian gut might create local
refuges, where bacteria remained protected against phage predation (Heilmann et al 2012). We
tested this hypothesis by examining several gut sections (luminal and mucosal parts from ileum and
colon) from mice sacrificed 24 hr after either the last administration of phages in Mt1B1-colonized
mice or the third day following a single CLB_P2 administration in 55989-colonized mice. We found
that strain Mt1B1 levels from the group of mice receiving phages were significantly lower in all
sections, except for the colon luminal sections, compared to the control group (Fig.4A and Table S6).
Phage levels were similar in all sections except the mucosal part of the ileum, in which they were

strongly reduced (Fig. 4B). A very similar trend was observed from the analysis of gut sections of
55989-colonized mice receiving a single dose of phage CLB_P2 compared to control group. Notably,
we found a significant reduction of 55989 levels in the luminal part of the ileum and a lower density
of phage CLB_P2 in the mucosal part of the ileum when comparing conditions of presence/absence
of CLB_P2 (Fig. 4C,4D).
The ratio of phages to bacteria in organs from both Mt1B1- and 55989-colonized mice show that the
mucosal sections of the ileum exhibit significantly lower phage/bacteria ratios (p=0.006; Table S6 add
CLB_P2 data) than the corresponding luminal sections (Fig. 4E, 4F). Thus, the mucosa seems to be
less accessible to phages than the lumen and may constitute a refuge in which a reservoir of the E.
coli population is protected against the phage predation. Phage diffusion in the gut may be limited
by mucins and other glycoproteins, lipids and DNA molecules (Johansson et al 2011, Qi et al 2017). A
specific in silico search for immunoglobulin motifs, which have been shown to favour phage binding
to mucus, revealed that only ORF 118 of phage P17 possess such a motif (homologous to the bacterial
Ig-like domain (Big2)) (Barr et al 2013, Fraser et al 2006). The absence of these motifs in three out of
the four phages studied here is consistent with our in vivo observation that these phages are less
abundant in the mucosal sections.

Discussion
The intestinal microbiota of mammals is relatively stable over time in healthy subjects while it
contains large antagonistic populations of bacteria and phages. The mechanisms that underlie this
apparently peaceful coexistence are unknown. Several hypotheses can be drawn from years of in
vitro studies of isolated systems (one phage/one bacterium) or more recently from environmental
studies (Buckling and Rainey 2002, Fortuna et al 2019, Horne 1970, Laanto et al 2017, Meyer et al
2016). However, none of them has yet been tested in relevant animal models. Using a gnotobiotic
mouse model, two E. coli strains and four different virulent phages, we show that the emergence of
phage-resistant bacteria and the possibility to infect off-target bacteria can be excluded as major
factors supporting coexistence. Instead, we found that the spatial distribution of phages and bacteria
along the radial axis of the gut fits the classical ecological theory of source-sink dynamics (Holt 1985).
Our data suggest that bacterial refuges in the mucosal layer serve as a source, with the lumen acting
as a sink in which the phages can infect their target. As phages do not exert a major direct selective
pressure on the source, the bacteria reaching the gut lumen remain susceptible enabling the phages
to maintain their density in the lumen over time (Fig 5).
In phage/bacterium interaction studies, the prey-predator dynamics have been classically studied
through the prism of phage-resistant bacteria and counter resistant phages including phage and
bacteria densities. In our experimental conditions, we found that our data fit with a source-sink
model. Recently, an in vitro study has proposed the model named “leaky resistance” to explain the
maintenance of virulent phages by the high rate of transitions between phage-resistant and phagesusceptible bacteria within the populations (Chaudhry et al 2018, Silveira and Rohwer 2016).
However, in our experimental data collected from two couples of phages and bacteria we failed to
isolate phage-resistant bacteria within the entire gut. This suggests that in our conditions, including
a single or repeated phage input, these phage-resistant bacteria may either carry a high cost or have
a low selective value (Gomez and Buckling 2011, Koskella et al 2012). Coupled with the concept of
costly phage resistance mutations, our results are in agreement with observations from in silico
individual based stochastic spatial models, which showed that structured environments can create
spatial refuges that lead to coexistence between bacteria and phages without the emergence of
resistant clones (Heilmann et al 2012, Sousa and Rocha 2019). In addition, the lower abundance of
phages in the ileum mucosa could be caused by the reduced bacterial density at this site, compared
to the other gut sections, according to a density-dependent phenomenon that was previously
observed in several in vitro structured environments (Eriksen et al 2018). This density-dependent
10

phenomenon has been linked to the “proliferation threshold” that proposes that a minimum number
of bacteria is needed for the phage to initiate infection and amplify (Payne et al 2000, Wiggins and
Alexander 1985). Note that the source-sink and the “proliferation threshold” hypotheses are not
mutually exclusive to support the presence of bacterial refuges driving the long-term coexistence of
phages and susceptible bacteria.

The presence of several IgG-like motives in capsid proteins of phages mediates their interaction with
mucus layers (Barr et al 2013). The analysis of the four phage genomes to detect IgG-like motives
revealed that only one contains a predicted protein with a single motif with a weak score. Therefore,
the lack of such motives is in agreement with our data showing that the density of phages in the
mucosal sections of both ileum and colon is significantly lower than in the corresponding luminal
sections. We hypothesize that the gut displays a mucosal-luminal gradient of phage density.
Consequently, bacterial populations are exposed to different phage concentrations.

Several other processes, not directly tackled in this study like the influence of abiotic factors, can
contribute to the coexistence of phage and bacteria populations in the mammalian gut (Lourenco et
al 2018, Scanlan et al 2019). In particular, phenotypic resistance, described as the ability of bacteria
to oscillate between phage-susceptible and phage-resistant cells by modulating the expression of
genes that encode for phage receptors, led by environmental or cellular stochasticity (Bull et al 2014,
Chapman-McQuiston and Wu 2008).

Our data show that the gnotobiotic OMM12 model is particularly well suited to study the molecular
mechanisms involved in phage bacteria dynamics in the gut. OMM12 community establishes a longterm stable composition over several mouse generations and can be used as platform to flexibly
incorporate additional bacterial strains to the community (Brugiroux et al 2016, Herp et al 2019,
Studer et al 2016). Interestingly, Hsu and colleagues recently reported the use of similar synthetic
microbiota models to study phage bacteria interactions with two major differences. First, axenic mice
were inoculated with bacterial strains during only two weeks before the inoculation of phages,
compared to the permanently colonized OMM12 mice. Therefore, the immune system is likely
stimulated by microbial components for the first time along the course of their experiments. Second,
the 10 bacterial strains chosen are from human origin, instead of mouse origin for OMM12, and may
rapidly undergo genetic adaptation to the mouse environment (Barroso-Batista et al 2014, Lourenco

et al 2016). Despite these differences, both mouse models confirm that the inoculation of virulent
phages in the gut generally leads to the coexistence of phages and bacteria. Hsu et al. found that
Enterococcus faecalis phage resistant mutants increased over time, while we could not detect such
events. In addition, they found that some phages have strong impact on abundance of cognate host
bacteria, while such impact was not previously observed in several mouse models (Maura et al 2012a,
Weiss et al 2009). This suggests that different phage-bacteria couples may exhibit distinct ecoevolutionary dynamics which points at even higher complexity of studying these interactions in
natural environments (Shkoporov and Hill 2019).

Additional studies on phage bacteria interactions in the gut to improve our understanding of the
infection dynamics are required to develop efficient phage-guided strategies and ultimately obtain
firm clinical evidences that are still lacking (Brussow 2017, Sarker et al 2016). A recent case report
showed that the in vitro isolation of a single virulent phage, used to target one multidrug resistant
strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, led to the eradication of this pathogen from the patient’s gut
(Corbellino et al 2019). While lacking mechanistic insights it confirms the medical potential of phages
to selectively eliminate bacteria residing in the gut.

Material and Methods
Ethics statement
All animal experiments were approved by the committee on animal experimentation of the Institut
Pasteur and by the French Ministry of Research. C57Bl/6J mice (seven to nine-week-old) OMM12 were
bred at Institut Pasteur (Paris, France). A total of 50 OMM12 mice were used.

Phage isolation
First, sewage water from four locations was filtered at 0.45μm and mixed with an equal volume of
2X Luria- Bertani (LB) medium. Second, these four mixtures were inoculated with a fresh growing
culture of Mt1B1 (OD of 0.4 at 600nm, final dilution 1/200) and incubated on a shaker at 37°C
overnight. The next day chloroform (1/10 volume) was added to the flasks and incubated at room
temperature for one hour before to be centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min. One mL of the supernatant
was mixed with 1/10 vol. of chloroform and centrifuged at 8000g for 5 min. A 100-fold dilution in TN
buffer (10mM Tris HCl pH7.5, NaCl 100mM) of the aqueous phase was prepared. 10µL of the
undiluted and diluted solutions were spread with an inoculation loop on the top of two separate LB
agar plates and allowed to dry for 30 min under a safety cabinet. Subsequently, 1 mL of an
exponentially growing culture of Mt1B1 was applied to cover entire each plate; the excess liquid
culture was removed and the plates were incubated at 37°C overnight. The next day, individual
plaques were picked and resuspended in tubes containing 200μl TN buffer. 1/10 vol. chloroform was
mixed and tubes were centrifuged at 8000g for 5 min. These steps of plaque purification were
performed three times. Finally, 10µL of the last resuspended plaque were added to 1mL of a liquid
culture of Mt1B1 (OD of 0.4 at 600nm) and incubated at 37°C in a shaker for 5 hours. 1/10 vol. of
chloroform was mixed and after centrifugation at 8000g for 5 min this stock was stored at 4°C and
served as starting solution for large scale lysates.

Bacterial strains, and host range tests
Bacterial strains including Mt1B1 (DSM-28618) and 55989 are listed in Table S1. Strain Mt1B1-DsRed,
was obtained by targeted recombineering using strain LF82-DsRed as template (De Sordi et al 2017).
Host range tests were performed as follows: 3µL of PBS-diluted phage solutions (0,2µm filtered
sterilized crude lysates adjusted to 107 pfu/mL) were deposited side by side on the lawn of each
tested bacterium on agar LB plates. Plates were incubated at 37°C overnight. Phages were grouped

according to their host range and three representative phages of the main groups were chosen (Table
S1).

Adsorption assays and phage growth
Three independent adsorption assays were performed for each phage according to the protocol
previously described (Chevallereau et al 2016). Data could be approximated using an exponential
function and adsorption times were defined as the time required to reach a threshold of 10% of nonadsorbed phage particles. To record phage growth and bacteria lysis, an overnight culture of strain
Mt1B1 was diluted in LB broth and grown to an OD600nm of 0.2 from which 150 µL were distributed
into each of the wells of a 96-well plate (Microtest 96 plates, Falcon). 10 µL of sterile phage lysates
diluted in PBS to obtain a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 x 10-2 in each well. Plates were incubated
in a microplate reader at 37°C, with a shaking step of 30 sec before the automatic recording of
OD600nm every 15 min over 20 hr (Glomax MultiDetection System, Promega, USA).

Phage genomes sequencing and analysis
Sterile phage lysates were treated by DNase (120 U) and RNase (240 µg/mL) and incubated for 30
minutes at 37°C. RNase/DNase reaction was stopped by adding EDTA (20 mM). Lysates were treated
with proteinase K (100 µg/mL) and SDS (0.5%) and incubated at 55°C for 30 minutes. DNA was
extracted by a phenol-chloroform protocol modified from Pickard (Pickard 2009). Sequencing was
performed using Illumina technology (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) MiSeq Nano with paired-end reads
of 250bp. Quality of reads was visualised by FastQC v0.10.1 Brabraham Bioinformatics
(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Assembly was performed using a
workflow implemented in Galaxy-Institut Pasteur using clc_assembler v4.4.2 and clc_mapper v4.4.2
(CLC Bio, Qiagen). Phage termini were determined by PhageTerm (Garneau et al 2017) and
annotations were performed by the RAST v2.0 server (Aziz et al 2008).

Search for Ig-like domains on phage genomes
Protein sequences of the four phages were scanned for homologs on Pfam database using the
HMMER website (Potter et al 2018). The results were compared to a comprehensive HMM (Hidden
Markov Models) database of Ig-like domains found on Pfam that was kindly provided by Dr. Sean
Benler.

Ex vivo phage replication assay
Oligo-MM12 mice received 200µL of strain Mt1B1 (107 CFU prepared from an overnight culture in LB
at 37°C) in sterile sucrose sodium bicarbonate solution (20% sucrose and 2.6% sodium bicarbonate,
pH 8) by oral gavage and three days after were sacrificed to collect and weight intestinal sections
(ileum, cecum and colon). PBS was added to each sample (1.75mL for ileum and colon and 5mL for
the cecum) before homogenization (Oligo-Macs, Milteny Biotech). A volume of 150µL of each
homogenized sample was distributed in the wells of a 96-well plate and 10µL of each individual phage
were added to reach an MOI of 1 x 10-2, and the plate was incubated at 37°C. A fraction of the
homogenized samples was also serially diluted in PBS and plated on Drigalski medium to count Mt1B1
colonies at t=0. Following five hours of incubation, samples were serially diluted in PBS and plated on
Drigalski medium as well as on LB agar plates overlayed with strain Mt1B1. Both set of plates were
incubated at 37°C overnight. The same procedure was followed for in vitro growth assays with
bacteria taken during exponential (OD 0.5) or stationary (24 hr) growth phase at 37°C with shaking.

Murine model of E. coli colonization and quantification of phages and bacteria
The long-term coexistence experiment with strain Mt1B1 included 7 mice (5 that received phages
and 2 that did not) and lasted 23 days. At day 0 mice feces were collected prior to Mt1B1
administration by oral gavage (200 µL of bacteria resuspended in sodium bicarbonate buffer from an
overnight liquid culture). Fecal pellets were transferred in pre-weighted, sterile, 2 ml tubes, weighted
and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Serial dilutions in PBS were performed and plated onto Drigalsky
plates. The three phages (2x107 PFU of each phage in 200 µL of PBS) were administered altogether
once by oral gavage at day 9. The level of phages was assessed from serial dilutions in PBS spotted
on LB plates overlayed with strain Mt1B1.
Two shorter independent experiments with stronger phage selective pressure were performed with
11 (6 with phages and 5 without) and 14 (8 with phages and 6 without) Mt1B1-colonized mice
respectively. At day 0 mice feces were collected prior to Mt1B1 administration (as described above)
by oral gavage. Fecal pellets were transferred in pre-weighted, sterile, 2 ml tubes, weighted and
resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Serial dilutions in PBS were performed and plated onto Drigalsky plates.
The three phages (2x107 PFU of each phage in 200 µL of PBS) were administered altogether once by
oral gavage at day 14, 15 and 16. The level of phages was assessed from serial dilutions in PBS spotted
on LB plates overlayed with strain Mt1B1. Each mouse was sacrificed at day 17 to collect feces and
intestinal sections all homogenized in PBS using gentleMACSTM OCtoDissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) and

plated on both Drigalski plates and LB plates overlayed with strain Mt1B1. The luminal sections
correspond to the gut contents that were recovered by pressing the surface of the tissues with the
back of a scalpel. The remaining tissues correspond to the mucosal sections that were homogenized
together with the organ epithelium.
For experiments with E. coli strain 55989 fecal samples were collected on day 1, 3, 7, 8, 9 and 10. On
the day 0, after collection of the fecal samples, we proceeded to the administration by oral gavage
of E.coli strain 55989 the same way than with strain Mt1B1. Approximately 2x109 CFUs/g per mouse,
resuspended in a sucrose bicarbonate solution (200g.L-1 sucrose, 26g.L-1 sodium bicarbonate, pH=8),
were administered. At day 7, after collection of the fecal sample, 200µL of either a phage suspension
containing approximately 2x108 pfus/mL of phage CLB_P2 (n=12) or PBS (n=6) were administered to
the mice by oral gavage. At days 8 and 10, feces were collected before sacrificing and dissecting the
mice in order to collect organs. Caecum, ileum and colon were collected, and for the latter two the
adherent and luminal part were separated and manipulated as reported above. The levels of bacteria
and phages were assessed as reported for the strain Mt1B1.

Identification of resistant clones
For the experiments using Mt1B1 and the cocktail, 20 clones from each gut section and fecal samples
(per mice) were streaked vertically in LB agar plates and subsequently each of the three phages was
horizontally streaked across. Plates were incubated at 37°C and phenotype was checked after 5h and
overnight.
For the experiments using 55989 and phage CLB_P2, the 75 to 94 isolated colonies per sample were
randomly chosen by a robot (Qpix 420; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA) and cultured overnight
in 150µL of LB Lennox in 96 well microplates. The next day, 10µL were added to a new plate filled
with 140µL of LB and incubated at 37°C for 2h. Then, 8µL of each clone were spotted on two
separated agar plates (LB Lennox) and let dry for 20 minutes. Then, a spot of 4µL of phage CLB_P2
(1x105 PFU/mL for one plate and 1x107 PFU/mL for the second plate) were spotted on top of each
bacterial spot. Susceptible clones are defined by the full or partial clearance of the bacterial spot at
one or both phage concentrations, while clones not affected by the phage at any concentration are
defined as resistant.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization
Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed as previously described on intestinal samples from
E. coli Mt1B1 colonized OMM12 mice bred at the LMU Munich where the fecal level of strain Mt1B1
reached 109 CFU/g (Brugiroux et al 2016). Ileal, cecal and colonic tissue was fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (4°C overnight), washed in 20% sucrose (4°C overnight), embedded in O.C.T
(Sakura), and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. FISH was performed on 7µm sections, using double 3´and
5´-labelled 16S rRNA targeted probes specific for Enterobacteriaceae (Ent186-2xCy3 (CCC CCW CTT
TGG TCT TGC)) and Eubacteria (1:1 mix of Eub338I-2xCy5 (GCT GCC TCC CGT AGG AGT) and Eub338III2xCy5 (GCT GCC ACC CGT AGG TGT)). 1 μg/mL–1 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roth) was used for
DNA staining. Images were recorded with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar).

qPCR for 16S quantification
From homogenized fecal samples, 500 µL were centrifuged at 8.000g for 10 min and the supernatant
removed. Pellets were diluted in 500 µL of lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM
EDTA, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ) and incubated for 15 min at 50°C (Yu and Morrison 2004).
Then, 100 µL of lysozyme (25mg/ml) was added and samples were incubated at 37°C for 2 hr. DNA
extraction was performed using the Maxwell Cell tissue kit (Promega). The primers, probes and qPCR
protocol were used in conformity with previously described methods (Brugiroux et al 2016) with the
exception of the SsoAdvancedTM Universal Probes Supermix (BioRad). The qPCR reactions were
performed in duplicate and in two independent runs using MasterCycler realplex4 from Eppendorf.
Statistical analysis is described in the section below.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis on the number of bacteria and phages were carried out using the lme4 and
lmerTest packages of R (Bates et al 2015, Kuznetsova et al 2017). Both CFU and PFU were log10transformed prior to analysis. In each experiment, two groups of mice were considered, a group
exposed to phages and a control (unexposed) group. Beyond these groups, the effects of phages
could be assessed based on the abundance of phages (log-PFU). Given the non-linearity of responses,
the day at which a measure was performed was considered as a categorical variable. Linear mixedmodels were used to account for random experimental effects (i.e., both individual and cage effects).
Overall effects were assessed with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Tukey’s comparisons
and were performed using the lsmeans R package (Lenth 2016).

16S-quantification data were analysed using multivariate analysis after standard normalization. A
principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with the R package ade4 on the matrix of ΔCt
values of 10 bacterial strains (strains YL2 and KB18 were not detected). In addition, a between-group
PCA was done in order to assess experimental effects, based on 12 groups of observations: 3 days (0,
14, and 17) and 4 cages (2 exposed, 2 unexposed).

Figure 1. E. coli strain Mt1B1 stably colonizes the gut of the OMM12 mice.
A. Fecal levels of E. coli strain Mt1B1 at the indicated time points for each OMM12 mouse (n=11)
receiving a single dose of 108 cfu by oral gavage at day 0. Red dots, individual values; horizontal bar,
median; box, 25th-75th quantiles, vertical bars, min/max values (within 1.5 x interquartile interval). B.
Localization by FISH of the strain Mt1B1 in the ileal section of Mt1B1-colonized OMM12 mice.
Intestinal cells (nuclei) were stained with DAPI (purple), and Mt1B1 (red+greenyellow) and
Eubacteria (red) were stained with specific FISH probes. A representative image from a group of four
mice is presented (images from colon and cecum are presented in Figure S1). Scale bar, 50µm.

Figure 2. Phages P3, P10 and P17 infect strain Mt1B1 both in vitro and ex-vivo.
A. Growth curves for strain Mt1B1 (n=3 for each condition) in liquid broth in the absence (grey) or
presence of phage P3 (orange), P10 (blue) or P17 (green), added at t=0, or of a cocktail of these three
phages (purple; equal proportions of each) added at t=0. Each phage dose is 100 fold lower than the
number of bacteria at t=0. The inset shows an enlargement for early time points. (error bars
represent standard error of the mean (SEM) B. Amplification over 5h (n=3 biological replicates) of
individual phages (P3, orange; P10, blue; P17, green; each at an MOI of 1 x 10-2) and Mt1B1 cells
(grey) in indicated homogenized gut sections (lu., luminal; mu, mucosal) from Mt1B1-colonized
OMM12 mice and flasks with Mt1B1 cells in exponential (exp.) (OD600nm=0.5) or stationary (stat.; 24h)
growth phases. N-fold multiplication relative to the initial number of phages added at t=0, which was
approximately 100 fold lower than the amount of Mt1B1 cells, is shown (means with standard
deviation).

Figure 3. The coexistence of virulent phages with their target strain does not affect the microbiota
composition of the OMM12 mice.
A. OMM12 mice (n=25) were colonized for 14 days before receiving PBS (red, n=11) or the three
phages P3, P10 and P17 together (blue, n=14; 6x107 PFU per dose made of the same amount of each
phage) by oral gavage once daily on three consecutive days. Levels of E. coli strain Mt1B1 in the feces
were recorded over time. B. Phage titers from the fecal samples reported in panel A. C.
Phage:bacteria ratio for fecal samples collected on days 15, 16 and 17 demonstrating the coexistence
of the two populations. Dots, individual values; horizontal bar, median; box, 25 th-75th quantiles,
vertical bars, min/max values (within 1.5 x interquartile interval). D. Between-group PCA (BCA, axes
1 and 2) for the 16S rRNA qPCR data for mice receiving PBS (n=5, filled circle) or the phage cocktail
(n=6, filled triangle) by oral gavage at the indicated time points (see the colors indicated) for 10
bacteria from the microbiota of the OMM12 mice (strains YL2 and KB18 were not detected).

Figure 4. The differential abundance of bacteria and phages in gut sections is consistent with
source-sink dynamics.
A. OMM12 mice (n=25) were colonized during 14 days before receiving PBS (red, n=11) or the three
phages P3, P10 and P17 together (blue, n=14; 6x107 PFU per dose, composed of equal proportions of
each phage) by oral gavage once daily on three consecutive days. Mice were then sacrificed and the
abundance of E. coli strain Mt1B1 in indicated gut sections was determined. B. Phage titers for the
samples reported in panel A. C. OMM12 mice (n=8) were colonized during 7 days before receiving PBS
(red, n=2) or a single dose of phage CLB_P2 (blue, n=6; 1x108 PFU) by oral gavage. Mice were
sacrificed 3 days later and the abundance of E. coli strain 55989 in indicated gut sections was
determined. D. Phage titers for the samples reported in panel C. E. Phage:bacteria ratio for the
indicated gut sections in panels A and B. F. Phage:bacteria ratio for the indicated gut sections in
panels C and D. Dots, individual values; horizontal bar, median; box, 25th-75th quantiles, vertical bars,

Figure 5. Schematic representation of the source-sink dynamics between bacteria and virulent phage
populations in the gut. Bacteria located close to the mucosal layer (in yellow) of epithelial cell form
refuges that phages cannot reached. In the intestinal lumen phages encounter enough bacteria to
persist by killing bacteria (dotted lines).
