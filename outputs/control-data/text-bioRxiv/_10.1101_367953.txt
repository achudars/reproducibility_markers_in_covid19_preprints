Abstract

10

In order to improve forecasting of pest epidemics, it is important to know the spatial scale at which specific

11

forecasts are reliable. To investigate the spatial scale of aphid outbreaks, we have developed a spatio-

12

temporal stochastic aphid population growth model, and fitted the model to empirical spatial time-series

13

aphid population data using a Bayesian hierarchical fitting procedure. Furthermore, detailed spatial data of

14

the initial phases of population growth was investigated in a semivariogram. Our results suggest that there

15

is limited spatial variation in the initial occurrence probability at a spatial scale of 10 km. Consequently, the

16

results support the hypothesis that initial aphid population sizes and outbreaks may be predicted in fields

17

within a 10 km radius. For farmers, this may imply that they can rely their decision of whether to spray

18

against aphids on observations made by other nearby farmers or by the consultancy service.

Introduction

22

Insect pests are responsible for serious negative effects on food production. The common cereal aphids,

23

the Cherry oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi), the Grain aphid (Sitobion avenae) and the Rose-grain aphid

24

(Metopolophium dirrhodum), are known to cause considerable losses to winter wheat in large parts of the

25

world, and these species have been estimated to cause losses of 700.000 tons per year in Europe due to

26

direct damage (Wellings et al. 1989). On top of this figure comes the indirect damage due to virus

27

transmission and sooty mold caused by the excretion of honeydew (Larsson 2005). Therefore, there is a

28

great interest in controlling aphids in winter wheat, and a number of simulation models have been

29

developed to predict the population development of these pests (e.g. Ciss et al. 2014; Duffy et al. 2017;

30

Holst & Ruggle 1997; Klueken et al. 2009). Furthermore, some population dynamic models have been

31

combined with modules on economy and pesticide choices to produce decision support systems with the

32

aim of helping farmers optimizing the timing of pesticide applications. Such decision support systems

33

include CPO in Denmark (Hagelskjær & Jørgensen 2003) and GETLAUS (Gosselke et al. 2001) in Germany. In

34

a review of decision support systems, (Axelsen et al. 2012) concluded that farmers generally do not use

35

decision support systems, and one of the reasons is that they do not find it worth the effort to spend time

36

on estimating aphid input densities. Instead, many farmers perform precautionary insecticide treatments,

37

which may not be economically sound.

38

The grain aphid is the most numerous aphid in winter wheat (Hansen 2003) in Denmark. In temperate

39

regions, it overwinters on grasses as eggs. When temperatures rise in spring, the eggs hatch into unwinged

40

females, which reproduce parthenogenetically. In the second or third generation, the majority of aphids are

41

winged individuals, which migrate into the cereal fields. The formation of winged individuals is initiated by

42

a complex combination of crowding (i.e. high densities), light and temperature (Hansen 2003). Despite high

43

temperatures, crowding may be prevented by adverse temperatures, precipitation, predators and

44

parasites. Once in the cereal fields, temperature is the key driver for aphid population growth, as shown by

45

Jones (1979). However, population growth may be modified by heavy rainfall, wind, parasites, disease and

46

predators (Hansen 2003; Jones 1979; Nakata 1995). Plantegenest et al. (2001) showed that not including

47

the effects of parasotoids and especially fungal diseases may cause over-estimates of aphid population

48

growth. Wang et al. (2015) and Chabert & Sarthou (2017) found that fertilizer input may increase aphid

49

populations. A few papers have studied the impact of heavy rainfall on aphid populations. In cotton fields,

50

Chamuene et al. (2018) found that in some, but not all cases rain incidents of less than 50 mm significantly

51

increased the mortality of the aphid Aphis gossypii. A nine-year study of soybean fields found significant

52

effects of precipitation patterns on the population dynamics of Aphis glycines (Stack Whitney et al. 2016).

53

In laboratory experiments, Mann et al. (1995) found that the loss of Sitobion avenae from oat plants was

54

correlated with rain intensity and duration, and increased when combined with wind gusts. Jones (1979)

55

observed that heavy rainfall before the ears appear may reduce aphid numbers on cereals, and that

56

information about rainfall may complement the prediction of population size based on temperature.

57

In order to optimize the decision support systems, large efforts have been spent on improving model

58

performance in relation to weather parameters and natural regulation. These efforts have without doubt

59

improved the models, but taking into consideration that aphid populations develop exponentially, and that

60

the population can double in 55 hours at 20°C (Dedryver et al. 2010), it is critical that the initial densities

61

are determined at high precision in order to predict the epidemic development. However, surprisingly little

62

efforts have been devoted to obtaining quick and reliable estimates of the initial densities, although several

63

methods have been developed to estimate the density of aphids in cereals. For instance, Elliott et al. (1990)

64

developed binomial sequential sampling plans that require rather larger efforts at low densities to produce

65

reliable estimates, and Hansen (1991), who suggested to investigate aphid presence/absence on 50 or 100

66

tillers and used an equation to convert to aphids per tiller. Both methods take some time, and come up

67

with assessments of average densities with some uncertainties. The uncertainties are predefined in the

68

sequential sampling plan and the required uncertainty level is decisive for the number of plants to

69

investigate. When counting presence/absence on a number of straws, the uncertainty can be calculated

70

before being used in simulation models and decision support systems. However, none of the models and

71

decision support systems appear to use uncertainty in their projections of aphid population development,

72

and in turn relate uncertainties to the output. Given that aphids show exponential population growth,

73

uncertainties in the estimate of initial densities can cause large uncertainties to the projections of the aphid

74

population density some weeks later. This uncertainty should ideally be reflected in the suggestions

75

produced by a decision support system.

76

To predict the spatial and temporal development of aphid outbreaks it is important to sample and model

77

population data that encompasses both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this study, we have sampled

78

aphid populations in a spatial setup during both the initial and the epidemic phase to fit a population

79

growth model. More specifically, we have developed a spatio-temporal stochastic aphid population growth

80

model and fitted the model to empirical spatial time-series aphid population data using a Bayesian

81

hierarchical fitting procedure. Such Bayesian hierarchical population models have successfully been applied

82

on a number of pest cases, e.g. the population dynamics of coffee berry borer infestation (Ruiz-Cárdenas et

83

al. 2009). The fitted spatio-temporal population growth model may be used to generalize existing

84

deterministic aphid forecasting models with the effect of stochastic spatial variation. Furthermore, we use

85

the fitted model and complementary spatial statistics to investigate the hypothesis that initial aphid

86

population sizes and outbreaks may be predicted in fields within a 10 km radius of the nearest aphid-

87

monitoring site.

88

Materials and Methods

89

Field sites and aphid sampling

90

The occurrence probability of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, i.e. the percentage wheat straws with

91

aphids (correlated with both number of aphids per straw, and number of aphids per area (Feng et al. 1993;

92

Hansen 2003; Hein et al. 1995)), was recorded in twelve wheat fields in central Jutland, Denmark, in 2016

93

and 2017. The wheat fields (=sites) were laid out in hierarchical geographic design with three regions of

94

four sites. In Denmark, aphids are monitored in the official aphid-sampling programme (Observation Web,

95

https://www.landbrugsinfo.dk/planteavl/plantevaern/varslingregistrerings-net/-sider/startside.aspx ). In

96

the current project, we used an Observation Web field as centre site for each of the three regions, and

97

within each region, three other sites (fields), positioned approximately three, six and ten kilometers away

98

(Fig. 1), were studied. As a consequence of the proximity of some of the Observation Web fields, the three

99

regions overlap to some extent. At each site, the occurrence probability of aphids on individual plants were

100

recorded and the occurrence probability was used as a proxy for the aphid population size, based on the

101

fact that percentage straws with aphids is highly correlated with the number of aphids per square meter

102

(Feng et al. 1993; Hansen 2003; Hein et al. 1995).

103

In 2016, aphid occurrence was recorded for five samples of either 80 or 100 wheat plants at each site on

104

May 24, June 6, June 13, June 20, June 27, July 4, and July 11. The five samples within a site were taken

105

along a transect with at least 50m between samples. Site-specific degree-days were calculated from the

106

average day temperature at the weather station closest to each site with a base temperature of 5 degrees

107

Celsius. Furthermore, the intensity of precipitation events at the different sites was recorded daily by a

108

weather station placed at each field (Agrimex® Rosenborg 35980).

109

In order to complement the result of the spatial variation of the initial phases of aphid outbreaks obtained

110

in the spatial modelling of the aphid occurrence data sampled in 2016, aphid occurrence was recorded

111

more intensively at the same twelve sites in the beginning of the growth period the following year and

112

analyzed in a semivariogram. In 2017, aphid occurrence was recorded for ten samples of 50 wheat plants at

113

each site on May 30 and June 7. The ten samples within a site were laid out along three transects with at

114

least 50m between all plots, and the exact geographical position of each sample was determined.

115

Statistical modelling of the aphid population

116

The spatio-temporal aphid occurrence data is modelled using Bayesian hierarchical methods (Clark &

117

Gelfand 2006). The observed number of straws with at least one aphid at site i and plot k at degree-day t is

118

denoted 𝑦𝑖,𝑘,𝑡 and is assumed to be binomially distributed with 𝑛𝑖,𝑘,𝑡 , the number of straws sampled, and

119

𝑝𝑖,𝑡 , the occurrence probability that a straw has at least one aphid at site i at degree-day t,

120

𝑦𝑖,𝑘,𝑡 ~𝐵𝑖𝑛(𝑛𝑖,𝑘,𝑡 , 𝑝𝑖,𝑡 )

121

The site-specific occurrence probability is modelled using an exponential function of degree-day t,

122

𝑝𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑝𝑖,0 𝐸𝑥𝑝(𝑟0 + 𝑟1 𝑡 + 𝑟2 𝑡 2 + 𝜖𝑖 )

123

where 𝑝𝑖,0 is the occurrence probability on a fixed initial day, 𝑟0 , 𝑟1 , and 𝑟2 are population growth

124

parameters, and 𝜖𝑖 are Gaussian distributed site-specific random effects, 𝜖𝑖 ~𝐺𝑎𝑢 (0, 𝜎𝑝2 ).

125

The n site-specific initial occurrence probabilities are assumed to arise from a Gaussian process model,

𝑑𝑖,𝑗 being the distance between site i and site j , 𝛼 is the scale of the spatial effect that is set to 10 km, and

130

covariance matrix by definition has to be positive definite, which puts upper and lower bounds on 𝜌0 .

131

The prior distributions of all parameters were assumed to be uniform except the two scale parameters that

132

were assumed to be inverse gamma distributed, 𝜎𝑝 ~𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑚(0.1,0.1) and 𝜎0 ~𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑚(0.1,0.1). The joint

133

Bayesian posterior distribution of the parameters and the two latent variable vectors, 𝑝𝑖,0 and 𝜖𝑖 , each of

with a multivariate normal candidate distribution and using a MCMC run of 300,000 iterations after a burn-

136

in period.

137

Plots of the sampling chains of all parameters and latent variables were inspected in order to check the

138

mixing properties of the used sampling procedure, and whether the burn-in period was sufficient.

139

Additionally, the overall fitting properties of the model were checked by inspecting the regularity and

140

shape of the marginal distribution of all parameters as well as the distribution of the deviance (=

141

−2 log 𝐿(𝑌|𝜃)). The efficiency of the MCMC procedure was assessed by inspecting the evolution in the

142

deviance.

143

Statistical inferences on the parameters were based on the marginal posterior distribution of the

144

parameters.

145

All calculations were done using Mathematica version 10 (Wolfram 2015).

146

Results

147

The observed spatio-temporal mean occurrence probability of S. avenae in 2016 (Fig. 2) was fitted to the

148

spatial growth model. The burn-in period of the MCMC was relatively long (600,000 iterations), but after

149

the deviance had stabilized, the fitting properties of the models were judged to be acceptable based on

150

visual inspections of the mixing properties of the parameters and the latent variables.

151

The deterministic part of the population growth model (eqn 1.) seemed to adequately model the dynamics

152

of aphid occurrence probabilities as a function of degree days from June 1 2016 to July 1 2016 (Fig. 3) when

153

shape and mode of the expected outbreak was visually compared to the observed spatio-temporal mean

154

occurrence probability data in the same period (Fig. 2). Furthermore, there were no apparent pattern

155

among the latent variables that model the among-site variation in population growth, 𝜖𝑖 (Fig. 4), which

156

indicate that where were no systematic regional effects influencing growth apart from degree days.

157

The marginal posterior distributions of the parameters of interest are summarized in Table 1 by their

158

percentiles. The parameters were generally uncorrelated, except for, as expected, the estimates of the

159

population growth parameters 𝑟0 , 𝑟1 and 𝑟2 , which were highly correlated (Table 2).

160

The posterior marginal distribution of the parameter that measures the effect of geographic distance on

161

the spatial covariance, 𝜌0 , is left-skewed towards the upper boundary and significantly larger than zero

162

(Table 1), and the site-specific initial occurrence probabilities are consequently positively correlated among

163

the sites at the spatial scale of 10 km. However, the importance of this positive correlation for the among-

164

site variation in aphid outbreaks has to be evaluated in relation to the estimated among-site variation in

165

the initial occurrence probability as modelled by 𝜎0 , and population growth as modelled by 𝜎𝑝 (Table 1).

166

The rainfall of the 2016 season is presented in the electronic supplement. Incidents of heavy rain were

167

observed in late May and in June, especially in the Viborg region, with incidents of up to 25 mm per day.

168

However, if the observed rain records at the sites were manually scored according to severity and

169

compared to the latent variables that model the among-site variation in population growth, 𝜖𝑖 , then there

170

was no significant relationship between the heavy rain score and population growth rate (results not

171

shown, P = 0.89).

172

The variation in aphid occurrence among sampling plots as a function of the geographical distance among

173

plots on May 30 and June 7 2017 is shown as a semi-variogram (Fig. 5). Generally, the variation among plots

174

is relative low at the two sampling days, although the variation seems to increase irregularly with time

175

when assessed from only two samples in time. There is a slight indication that the variation among plots

176

increases with the distance among plots at the second sampling.

177

Discussion

178

The site-specific initial occurrence probabilities were found to be positively correlated among the sites at

179

the spatial scale of 10 km. However, when the spatial variation in the initial occurrence probability was

180

examined in more detail the following year, the spatial variation among plots in the beginning of the aphid

181

outbreaks did not seem to increase much with among-plot distance. This indicates that there was only

182

limited spatial effects, i.e. that the initial epidemic development was more or less in synchrony over

183

distances up to and above 10 km. Since the parameter that measures the effect of geographic distance on

184

the spatial covariance, 𝜌0 , also depends on the spatial variation in the following aphid epidemic estimated

185

from the 2016 data set, we tend to put more weight on the more detailed investigation in 2017, and

186

conclude that our investigation suggest that there is limited spatial variation in the initial occurrence

187

probability. Consequently, the overall results support the working hypothesis that initial aphid population

188

sizes and outbreaks may be predicted for fields within a 10 km radius of the aphid-monitoring site. For

189

farmers, this may imply that they can rely their decision of whether to spray against aphids on observations

190

made within a distance of up to 10 km.

191

We did not detect any significant effects of heavy rain events on aphid occurrence probability. This is

192

contradictory to the conclusions of Whitney et al. (2016) and the experimental findings by Mann et al.

193

(1995) that heavy rainfall may cause a loss of aphids up to 30 % of the population. The rainfall incidents

194

measured per day in the present study resemble those studied by Chamuene et al. (2018), who found that

195

such incidents may cause increased aphid mortality and hence reduce population growth in some, but not

196

all cases. One reason why we did not see a reduced population increase may be that most rainfall incidents

197

happened after the ears of the winter wheat appeared, as Jones (1979) only found rainfall before ear

198

appearance to affect aphid numbers.

199
200

The simple quadratic function used to model population growth as a function of degree-days performed

201

adequately for modelling the growth in the aphid population from June 1 2016 to July 1 2016. However, the

202

purpose of this simple quadratic model was only to model the deterministic part of the population growth

203

in order to quantify the stochastic variation among sites, and the fitted quadratic model is not suitable for

204

making actual predictions outside the domain of the collected aphid population data. Instead, the

205

deterministic part of the population growth could be the models described by Holst et al. (1997), Ciss et al.

206

(2014), Duffy et al. (2017) or the model element of the aphid modules of decision support systems such as

207

CPO (Hagelskjær & Jørgensen 2003) and GETLAUS (Gosselke et al. 2001).

208
209

Most decision support systems will let the user know if it is appropriate to treat against aphids or not,

210

without telling how certain the “decision” is (e.g. GETLAUS (Gosselke et al. 2001) and CPO (Hagelskjær &

211

Jørgensen 2003). If the output came with uncertainties, such as “It can now with 55% certainty pay off to

212

treat against aphids in your field”, using the decision support system may appear more difficult, because

213

the farmer is left with an uncertain foundation for his decision. However, the output might include

214

information on how to reduce the uncertainty. If the farmer had counted aphids on 50 tillers, the output

215

might tell the farmer that the uncertainty would be reduced if he continued and counted on a higher

216

number of tillers, and he could continue until he was able to take certain decisions. This would require

217

some time, but the farmers would get some knowledge on the importance of spending time on providing

218

the decision support system with good initial aphid density estimates, as spending more time will provide a

219

safer foundation for decisions. Estimates of initial densities can be used to predict peak densities of S.

220

avenae (Honek et al. 2017), and good estimates of initial densities will, everything else equal, provide

221

better estimates of peak densities.

222
223

Nevertheless, the farmer might still not be willing to spend the required time on counting aphid, but

224

counting might be found worth the effort if the result could be used by neighbors, or by all farmers within a

225

certain area. This would optimize the balance between time input spend on counting aphids and economic

226

output in terms of higher yield and probably less expenses on pesticide applications.

Fig3. Expected occurrence probability of S. avenae at the mean degree-days from June 1 2016 to July 1

250

2016. The curve is calculated using equation (2), the expected 𝜇0 , and the joint posterior distribution of 𝑟0,

251

𝑟1 , and 𝑟2 . The thick line is the median occurrence probability and the two thin lines are the 25% percentile

252

and 75% percentile of the occurrence probability. The shaded area is the 95% credibility interval of the

253

occurrence probability.
