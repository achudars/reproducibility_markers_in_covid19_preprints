Abstract
Purpose​: Several recent studies have utilized a 3-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution
pipeline to obtain quantitative metrics of brain tissue microstructure from diffusion-weighted
MRI data. The three tissue compartments, comprising white matter-, grey matter-, and CSF-like
(free water) signals, are potentially useful in the evaluation of brain microstructure in a range of
pathologies. However, the reliability and long-term stability of these metrics has not yet been
evaluated.
Methods​: This study examined estimates of whole brain microstructure for the three tissue
compartments, in three separate test-retest cohorts. Each cohort has different lengths of time
between baseline and retest, ranging from within the same scanning session in the shortest
interval to three months in the longest interval. Each cohort was also collected with different
acquisition parameters.
Results​: The CSF-like compartment displayed the greatest reliability across all cohorts, with
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values being above 0.95 in each cohort. White matter-like
and grey matter-like compartments both demonstrated very high reliability in the immediate
cohort (both ICC>0.90), however this declined in the 3 month interval cohort to both
compartments having ICC>0.80. Regional CSF-like signal fraction was examined in bilateral
hippocampus and had an ICC>0.80 in each cohort.
Conclusion​: The 3-tissue CSD techniques provide reliable and stable estimates of tissue
microstructure composition, up to 3 months longitudinally in a control population. This forms an
important basis for further investigations utilizing 3-tissue CSD techniques to track changes in
microstructure across a variety of brain pathologies.

Introduction
Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is a widely used, noninvasive,
method for measuring the diffusion of water molecules in the brain. Within the
microarchitectural environment of the brain, diffusion of water molecules is hindered by various
cellular components, particularly the lipid bilayers that make up cell membranes. This principle
has been applied to study white matter fiber bundles (“tracts”), as the myelin sheaths
surrounding neuronal axons result in anisotropic diffusion (Basser et al., 1994; Pierpaoli & Basser,
1996; Boullerne, 2016). dMRI has seen widespread use in studies of brain connectivity as well as
in clinical populations and neurosurgery (Le Bihan et al., 2001; Nimsky et al., 2005; Alexander et
al., 2007; Johansen-Berg & Behrens, 2013).
Initially, anisotropic diffusion was typically modelled using a tensor, which sought to
quantify both the average orientation, anisotropy, and magnitude of diffusion within each voxel
of the brain; this approach is known as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI, Basser et al., 1994). More
recently, the dMRI modelling domain has seen a proliferation in novel, more advanced,
mathematical methods for analyzing the diffusion-weighted signal. These methods aim to
overcome several shortcomings of applying the relatively simplistic DTI model to the complex
diffusion-weighted signals observed in the brain. This complexity primarily arises from two
physiological qualities of the brain itself: the first being crossing fibers, where white matter (WM)
tracts occupying the same voxel are oriented differently in space (Wiegell et al., 2000; Tuch et al.,
2003); and the second being the presence of other fluids and tissues, including cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) and grey matter (GM) and other cell bodies which “contaminate” the directional signal
(Chenevert et al., 1990; Jones & Cercignani, 2010; ​Rydhög et al, 2017). These are major issues as
it has been estimated that up to 90% of WM tissue voxels contain more than one WM fiber tract
orientation (Jeurissen et al., 2013), and partial voluming effects alone ensure that a substantial
number of voxels contain proportions of multiple tissue and/or fluid compartments (Alexander et
al., 2001).
To address these issues, and with the advent of high angular resolution diffusion imaging
(HARDI) acquisition protocols, more advanced methods for describing the observed dMRI data
have been proposed by a number of researchers (Tournier et al., 2011; for reviews see Assaf &
Pasternak, 2008; and Dell’Acqua & Tournier 2018). One such method, Constrained Spherical
Deconvolution (CSD), allows for the presence of multiple fibers along different orientations
(Tournier et al., 2007). CSD resolves these orientations by deconvolving the signal profile
corresponding to a prototypical single fiber-like voxel (termed a response function) from the
observed signal in each and every other voxel, resulting in the orientation of fibers as a
continuous angular function termed the Fiber Orientation Distribution (FOD). Quantitative
information can also be obtained from the FOD, as a measure of “Apparent Fiber Density” (AFD)
for each fiber population (Raffelt et al., 2012).

The original (“single-tissue”) CSD has been expanded into Multi-Shell Multi-Tissue CSD
(MSMT-CSD) by performing a similar deconvolution with 3 separate WM, GM, and CSF-like tissue
response functions. The approach was initially aimed at separating signal originating from GM
and CSF-like tissue compartments, in order to improve the accuracy of the WM FOD itself, which
otherwise appears very noisy (with many false positive “peaks” or lobes) when using single-tissue
CSD in areas of partial voluming with other tissues and fluids (Jeurissen et al., 2014). This
subsequently benefits several other analysis and processing steps, such as streamline
tractography, which heavily rely on a “clean” and accurate WM FOD. MSMT-CSD thus attempted
to address the main shortcomings of the DTI model as well as additional remaining shortcomings
of single-tissue CSD.
As its name hints at, MSMT-CSD requires a ​multi-shell ​diffusion acquisition scheme in
order to successfully tease apart contributions from the 3 WM-, GM- and CSF-like compartments
at once. However, to obtain the same benefits offered by MSMT-CSD, yet using only ​single-shell
data, Dhollander & Connelly, (2016) have proposed a novel approach named Single-Shell 3-Tissue
CSD (SS3T-CSD) that can resolve the WM-, GM- and CSF-like compartments as well. By relying
only on ​single-shell data, it allows for shorter acquisition times and is compatible with a wider
range of data, both historical as well as clinical.
Resolving these different compartments using either 3-tissue CSD method (i.e.,
MSMT-CSD or SS3T-CSD) holds value beyond improving WM tractography: it can also serve as a
proxy for the evaluation of brain microstructure and tissue composition (Dhollander et al., 2017;
Mito et al., 2018; Mito et al. 2019). By interrogating brain voxels for diffusion signal patterns that
look ‘like’ compositions of the diffusion signals represented by the WM/GM/CSF response
functions, it might be possible to gain quantifiable information about microstructure (Figure 1).
Using these basic compartments as a diffusion signal model focuses more on coarse properties of
brain tissue microstructure rather than separating similar cell types (e.g. different populations of
glial cells), or separating different types of pathology (e.g. edema, CSF-infiltration in
neurodegeneration, and damage from ischemic stroke). Although, provided with a known
context, reasonable inferences of such pathology might be possible to make nonetheless. Even
for WM tractography in cases of infiltration by pathological tissues, the 3-tissue CSD approach
can provide direct benefits in terms of recovering healthy WM structures, e.g. in infiltrating
tumors (Aerts et al. 2019).

Figure 1: ​Axial slices showing a T1-weighted MPRAGE and the GM-, CSF-, and WM-like tissue
compartments derived from the dMRI data using 3-tissue CSD.
3-tissue CSD derived compartments are a promising, non-invasive method for exploring
tissue composition in the brain. The utilization of this approach toward analyzing tissue
composition might hold advantages over tensor-based models such as Free Water Elimination
(FWE, Pasternak et al., 2009). The free water estimate from the FWE technique was shown to
have limited reproducibility: errors ranged from 5.2-18.2% across ROIs in a test-retest cohort
(Albi et al., 2017). The CSF-like compartment from 3-tissue CSD techniques might provide an
alternative way to recover free water contribution to the signal, using a WM model that does
take into account crossing fibres (as opposed to a tensor method). With the advances provided in
SS3T-CSD, it is also able to provide signal contribution from the full 3 tissue compartments using
single-shell data (i.e. equivalent to acquisition requirements for the FWE technique), allowing for
a broader range of input data compared to other 3-tissue compartment models such as NODDI
(Zhang et al., 2012). In a recent review of microstructural diffusion imaging applied to psychiatric
disorders, Pasternak et al., (2018) illustrated the acquisition sequence complexity compared to
the number of microstructure compartments evaluated for several common dMRI analysis
techniques. Addition of MSMT-CSD and SS3T-CSD illustrate the range of data required for input
to a range of models and the capabilities of resolving compartments compared to other
techniques (Figure 2).

To date, there has not been a quantitative test-retest study examining the reliability and
long-term stability of 3-tissue CSD techniques. The purpose of this study is to provide evidence
that 3-tissue CSD techniques are a reliable and stable approach for assessing brain
microarchitecture, via analysis of the 3 resulting tissue signal fractions.

Methods
Cohorts​: Three test-retest cohorts were retrospectively evaluated in this study: two local
datasets collected at the University of Virginia from ongoing research projects, and one publicly
available dataset obtained from the Nathanial Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research: enhanced
test-retest (eNKI-TRT) as part of the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (Biswal et al., 2010;
Nooner et al., 2012). Both studies collected at the University of Virginia received ethical approval
from the University of Virginia Institutional Review Board for Health Sciences Research. Each
cohort has different time intervals between baseline and retest scans, and was collected with
different acquisition parameters. This approach allows reliability to be measured under
conditions that represent a variety of different diffusion imaging parameters. Examining stability

across different time periods allows for insight into the potential for longitudinal studies tracking
changes in 3-tissue signal fractions in individuals or between groups over time.
The first cohort (”​immediate rescan”​ cohort) examined immediate test-retest reliability by
performing identical dMRI acquisitions sequentially without table repositioning. This cohort
consisted of individuals participating in a separate study at the University of Virginia that
included multiple scanning sessions. The cohort consisted of 20 healthy control participants (all
male, age at baseline: 22.8±3.0 SD). Each participant was scanned twice at each of 3 visits (with
the exception of one participant who only attended 2 scans) for a total of 59 baseline-rescan
pairs collected for analysis.
The second cohort (”​short timescale​” cohort) is representative of the quality of diffusion
imaging found in large-scale, open science cohorts. Subjects were selected from the original NKI
Rockland community study, a group intentionally recruited for similarity to the demographics of
the broader United States as a whole (Nooner et al., 2012). 20 subjects (5 female, age at
baseline: 34.4±12.9 SD) had diffusion MRI data available at both baseline and rescan. All
participants were rescanned within a range of 7-60 days after baseline. Subjects were ​not
excluded for any history of illness, and 2 participants had a diagnosed history of prior alcohol
abuse while 2 other participants had a diagnosed history of a major depressive disorder. Both of
these diagnoses are known to affect brain function and structure (Oscar-Berman & Marinkovic,
2007; Jiang et al., 2017) but the nature of the within-subjects design did not necessitate
removing any individuals from the study.
The third cohort (”​long timescale”​ cohort) was collected as a healthy control group for a
previously published study conducted at the University of Virginia examining college athletes
(Reynolds et al., 2017). 52 participants (all male, age at baseline: 21.9±3.3 SD) were re-scanned
3-4 months after baseline (mean days between scans: 107.9±7.1 SD) and were screened for a
history of neurologic disease or concussion.
Image Acquisition​: As discussed previously, data from the three cohorts were acquired using
different protocols.
The ​immediate rescan cohort was scanned using a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner with an
isotropic voxel size of 1.7⨉1.7⨉1.7mm​3​, TE=70ms and TR=2900ms. Using a multi-shell protocol,
10 b=0 images and 64 gradient directions at both b=1500s/mm​2 and b=3000s/mm​2 were
acquired. This protocol was applied twice with one immediately following the other without
actively repositioning the participant in the scanner.
The ​short timescale cohort was acquired externally and obtained through the
Neuroimaging Tools and Resources Collaboratory at ​www.nitrc.org​. Imaging data was collected
using a Siemens Trio Tim with an isotropic voxel size of 2⨉2⨉2mm​3​, TE=85ms and TR=2400ms.
Using a single-shell protocol, 9 b=0 images and 127 gradient directions at b=1500s/mm​2 were
acquired.

The ​long timescale cohort was scanned using the same Siemens Prisma 3T scanner as the
first (immediate rescan) cohort using a different protocol with an isotropic voxel size of
2.7⨉2.7⨉2.7mm​3​, TE=100ms. Using a multi-shell protocol, 1 b=0 image and 30 gradient
directions at both b=1000s/mm​2​ and b=2000s/mm​2​ were acquired.
Analysis​: Data preprocessing was largely identical across all images in all cohorts in the study.
Images were first denoised (Veraart et al., 2016). Gibbs ringing was then corrected (Kellner et al.,
2016). This was followed by utilizing the FSL package (​“topup”​ and ​“eddy”)​ to correct for
susceptibility induced (EPI) distortions, eddy currents, and subject motion (Smith et al., 2004;
Andersson et al., 2003; Andersson & Sotiropoulos, 2016; Andersson et al., 2016). Finally, we
upsampled the preprocessed data to 1.3⨉1.3⨉1.3mm​3​ isotropic voxels (Greenspan, 2008;
Kuklisova-Murgasova et al., 2012; Bastiani et al., 2019). These preprocessing steps are largely
similar to those used in other recently published works (Bastiani et al., 2019; Pietsch et al., 2019;
Mito et al., 2019; Aerts et al., 2019). Brain masks were obtained for all subjects by performing a
recursive application of the Brain Extraction Tool (Avants et al., 2014).
For 3-tissue CSD processing, the 3-tissue response functions were obtained from the data
themselves using an unsupervised method (Dhollander et al., 2016), resulting in the single-fiber
WM response function as well as isotropic GM and CSF response functions for each subject. For
each tissue type (WM, GM, CSF), the response function was averaged across all individuals in
each cohort to obtain a single unique set of 3-tissue response functions per cohort. For the
multi-shell​ data in the immediate rescan and long timescale cohorts, MSMT-CSD was performed
(Jeurissen et al., 2014). For the ​single-shell​ data in the short timescale cohort, SS3T-CSD was
performed (Dhollander & Connelly, 2016). For all subjects in all cohorts, this resulted in their
WM-like compartment (represented by a complete WM FOD) as well as GM-like and CSF-like
compartments. The CSF-like compartment can in this context also be interpreted as a free-water
(FW) compartment (Dhollander et al., 2017). Finally, each subject’s three tissue compartments
were then normalised to sum to 1 on a voxel-wise basis, resulting in the final 3-tissue signal
fraction​ maps (Mito et al., 2019); the metrics for which we performed the test-retest analyses in
this work.
To measure the CSF-like (free water) signal fraction in the hippocampus of each subject in
the immediate rescan cohort, a template was first produced from a combination of all 118
individual scans. This was achieved using an affine, followed by non-linear registration on the
WM FODs themselves in an unbiased manner (Raffelt et al., 2011). A whole brain WM image
from the LONI atlas (Shattuck et al., 2008) was registered along with each hippocampus map to
the template using the ANTs image registration toolbox (Avants et al., 2009) and then
subsequently warped to each individual scan using the reverse transform from template
creation. In native space, an average was computed of the CSF-like (free water) signal fractions in
the ROI, using only voxels with a CSF-like signal fraction smaller than 0.5, to mimic free water

be entirely CSF-filled spaces).

Results
The CSF-like (free water) tissue signal fraction map was restricted to voxels where the
corresponding WM and GM signal maps summed to greater than 50%. This allowed for analysis
of the CSF-like signal fraction in tissue without including the ventricles or subarachnoid space, the
bulk size of which would otherwise bias a proper whole-brain free water measurement.
Additionally, the CSF-like infiltration into brain tissue is a potentially more interesting
measurement in the context of healthy functioning or pathology; and is indeed designed to be
comparable to measurements of free water encountered in the literature (Pasternak et al.,
2009). For all cohorts, results from the 3-tissue signal fractions were averaged across the brain
parenchyma. Averages for baseline and retest values were compared by calculating the intraclass
correlation coefficient (ICC) and Pearson’s correlations. The results for both of these measures
are summarized in Table 1.
Specific test-retest correlations for each of the three tissue types derived from the
3-tissue CSD techniques are presented in Figures 3-5. All correlations between baseline and
retest were significant in all cohorts; the highest whole brain ICC values were obtained from the
immediate rescan cohort (Figure 3). In the ​short timescale cohort, similar to the immediate
rescan cohort, all compartments had an ICC value above 0.95 and Pearson’s Rho above 0.90
(Figure 4). The ​long timescale cohort had slightly declined performance, yet with the ICC value for
all compartments still being larger than 0.80 (Figure 5).

In each cohort, the hippocampi were also analyzed separately in order to demonstrate the utility
of a 3-tissue CSD approach in a specific region of interest. Bilateral hippocampus was selected for
this demonstration as a commonly studied brain ROI with representation from each of the three
tissue compartments examined. Comparison of average CSF-like (free water) signal fraction in
this ROI between baseline and retest in the ​immediate rescan ​cohort resulted in an ICC value
above 0.90 in both left and right hippocampus, as well as a significant Pearson’s correlation
(Figure 6). In the ​short timescale ​cohort both left and right hippocampus similarly had an ICC
value above 0.90 and a significant Pearson’s correlation (Figure 7). In the ​long timescale c​ ohort

There was a consistent asymmetrical effect observed between the CSF-like signal fraction
in right and left hippocampus across all cohorts. The CSF-like signal fraction in each subject’s right
and left hippocampus were averaged between baseline and rescan and a paired t-test performed
for each cohort. This showed that there was a significantly greater CSF-like signal fraction in the
right versus the left hippocampus (T​58​ = -10.022, p<0.001; T​19​ = -6.002, p<0.001; and T​51​ = -23.486,
p<0.001; for the ​immediate rescan, short timescale, a​ nd ​long timescale​ cohorts, respectively).

Discussion
Each of the 3-tissue signal fractions demonstrated good reliability across all of the
measured timescales we assessed in this work. ICC values were above 0.95 for each of the tissue
compartments included in the ​immediate rescan and ​short timescale cohorts. This occurred
despite the ​short timescale cohort being ​single-shell data with a b-value of 1500s/mm​2​, and a
lower voxel size compared to the other two cohorts (both of which were ​multi-shell and had
highest b-values of b=3000s/mm​2 and b=2000s/mm​2 for the ​immediate timescale and ​long
timescale cohorts, respectively). This result suggests that 3-tissue CSD techniques can reliably
obtain quantitative measurements across a range of diffusion imaging protocols, including from
openly available datasets. This performance, however, declined slightly in the ​long timescale
cohort: the CSF-like (free water) signal fraction within tissue still had an ICC value above 0.95
while the WM-like and GM-like signal fractions had a slightly lower ICC value, yet still above 0.80
nonetheless. Regardless, all Pearson’s correlations were highly significant, indicating that 3-tissue
CSD techniques are still able to obtain reliable measurements of brain tissue microstructure,
stable up to 3 months from baseline.
Additionally, the free water signal fraction demonstrated good reliability in both
hippocampi at each of the examined timescales. ICC values were above 0.80 and a significant
effect of laterality was observed consistently across each cohort, with the right hippocampus
having significantly higher free water signal fraction than the left hippocampus. Though this study
does not suggest any hypothesis for why this laterality was observed, it is consistent with
volumetric MRI findings that demonstrate hippocampal asymmetry (for a meta-analysis see
Pedraza et al., 2004), as well as a recent study that reported asymmetry in hippocampal free
water content (Ofori et al., 2019). This suggests that free water signal fraction is both a reliable
quantitative measurement for subcortical ROIs, and that it may be able to detect meaningful
microstructural properties of such regions.
Standard neuroimaging techniques do not provide quantifiable data on brain
microstructural architecture, however this study has demonstrated a reproducible and reliable
method for obtaining whole brain maps with quantifiable estimates of brain microstructure. This
measure is stable enough to be used in longitudinal studies lasting at least up to three months;
and provides information on a voxel- or region-wise basis for analysis of subcortical structures,
lesions, or developing brains (Dhollander et al., 2017; Mito et al., 2018; Mito et al., 2019; Bastiani
et al., 2019). Related microstructural analysis of free water signal fractions has been performed in
the context of Parkinson’s disease (Ofori et al., 2015; Burciu et al., 2016), Schizophrenia
(Pasternak et al., 2012; Mandl et al., 2015), and concussion (Pasternak et al., 2014). 3-tissue CSD
techniques may thus have the potential to be applied to a variety of these and other neurological
conditions.

3-tissue CSD derived tissue fractions provide a flexible framework for analyzing diffusion
images in ways not addressed in this paper. While we examined the reliability of
WM/GM/CSF-like tissue signal fractions here, other researchers have used response functions
representing different tissue compartments when contextually appropriate. Pietsch et al., (2019)
applied two different WM response functions representing mature and immature WM in a
developing adolescent cohort to observe WM maturation. Mito et al., (2019) proposed to apply
a statistical framework of compositional data analysis to analyze the full 3-tissue composition of
WM-, GM- and CSF-like signal fractions directly to study microstructure in white matter lesions,
following the initial suggestion of moving towards such WM/GM/CSF-like diffusion signal fraction
interpretation by Dhollander et al. (2017). In Aerts et al., (2019), this idea was furthermore used
for the purpose of disentangling WM FODs representing infiltrated WM tracts in the presence of
gliomas, so as to enable more reliable within-tumor tractography. Similar work has also recently
been done by Chamberland et al., (2019), who illustrated the use of 3-tissue signal fractions in
the presence of cerebral metastases, both to assess their microstructure as well as to enable
tractography through nearby edematous regions.
The relatively recent use of CSD to describe the diffusion signal (Tournier et al., 2007) has
led to some measure of controversy when compared to other established analysis techniques
such as those based in multi-tensor models. One particular area of concern has been noted as
the generation of ‘false-fibers’ on tracking algorithms due to spurious fODF peaks (Parker et al.,
2013; Ning et al., 2015). Some studies using recent methodological improvements have
suggested that the prevalence of false-fibers in CSD is oversold compared to other methods
(Wilkins et al., 2015; Schilling et al., 2018). In this study 3-tissue CSD demonstrated good
reliability across all compartments, suggesting that if false-positive fibers are present, they are
not large enough component of the overall signal in each voxel to introduce significant amounts
of variance in the corresponding signal fractions.
An additional benefit provided by 3-tissue CSD methods is in the potential for tissue type
specific masking. The CSF-like compartment presented in this paper is calculated as CSF-like
diffusion in tissue by relying on the other compartments to identify which voxels were ‘tissue’.
Unlike a binary tissue segmentation based on T1 intensity, calculations of WM- and GM-like
signal fraction compartments together were used to define voxels where ‘tissue’ composed a
majority of signal from each voxel. This process relied exclusively on the single, native space
diffusion image instead of reslicing and warping a separate structural image or atlas. Future
studies might be able to take advantage of this approach by examining tissue compartment
magnitudes inside voxels defined by the behavior of other tissue compartments. For example,
tracking CSF-like (free water) tissue infiltration into voxels defined by the high proportion of
WM-like tissue during aging or in certain pathological contexts.

Conclusion
In this study, we performed a test-retest reliability and longer term stability analysis of
the 3-tissue signal fractions as obtained from 3-tissue CSD techniques. We found that 3-tissue
CSD techniques provide reliable and stable estimates of tissue microstructure composition, up to
3 months longitudinally in a control population. This forms an important basis for further
investigations utilizing 3-tissue CSD techniques to track changes in microstructure across a variety
of conditions.
