Summary
The regulation of neuropeptide level at the site of release is essential for proper
neurophysiological functions. We focused on a prominent neuropeptide, oxytocin (OXT), and
used the zebrafish as an in vivo model to visualize and quantify OXT content at the resolution
of a single synapse. We found that OXT-loaded synapses were surrounded by polymerized
actin. Perturbation of actin filaments by cytochalasin-D resulted in decreased synaptic OXT
levels. Live imaging of the actin probe, Lifeact-EGFP, showed reduced mobility in OXT
synapses in robo2 mutants, which displayed decreased synaptic OXT content. Using a novel
transgenic reporter line allowing real-time monitoring of OXT-loaded vesicles, we showed that
robo2 mutants display slower rate of vesicles accumulation. OXT-specific expression of
dominant-negative Cdc42, which is a key regulator of actin dynamics and a downstream
effector of Robo2, led to a dose-dependent increase in OXT content in WT, and a dampened
effect in robo2 mutants. Our results link Robo2-Cdc42 signalling, which controls local actin
dynamics, with the maintenance of synaptic neuropeptide levels.

Introduction
The regulation of neurotransmitter level at the site of release is essential for proper
neuronal function and requires constant replenishment, capture and removal of excess or
aged components in synapses. The axonal cytoskeleton contains microtubules,
neurofilaments and actin. Actin dynamics have been studied primarily in the context of
morphological changes of growth cones and synapse; however, recent studies indicate that
dynamic changes in synaptic actin also modulate synaptic efficacy (Cingolani and Goda, 2008).
Conflicting evidence exists for the role of actin filaments in regulating vesicular mobility
(Gaffield et al., 2006; Levitan, 2008; Miyamoto, 1995; Nelson et al., 2013; Nunes et al., 2006).
However, the majority of such studies were based on actin disrupting or polymerizing agents
using cell culture systems or non-vertebrate genetic model organisms. Others have claimed
that actin has a molecular scaffolding, not propulsive, role in presynaptic function
(Sankaranarayanan et al., 2003).
A well characterized signalling pathway that regulate actin dynamics in neurons is
mediated by the Robo family of cell-surface receptors (Kidd et al., 1998; Slovakova et al.,
2012). Activation of Robo triggers actin depolymerization which is mediated by intracellular
actin interacting regulatory proteins such as Cdc42, N-Wasp and Arp2/3 (Wong et al., 2001).
To address the fundamental topic of synaptic neuropeptide homeostasis we focused on
the well-studied neuropeptide, oxytocin (OXT). Oxytocin is a classical evolutionarily conserved
neuropeptide, which is involved in the maintenance of various homeostatic functions and
whose major axonal release site is the posterior pituitary, also known as the neurohypophysis
(Pearson and Placzek, 2013; Wircer et al., 2016). Thus neurosecretory cells produce the
neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin that are packed into large dense core vesicles (LDCV)
and are transported along the axons that terminate in the neurohypophysis. Upon
physiological demand, the neuropeptide is released into the blood stream to influence the
function of target cells throughout the body (Burbach et al., 2001; Knobloch and Grinevich,
2014). In contrast to small neurotransmitters synaptic release, which mainly occurs in highly
specialized membrane structures called active zones, neuropeptides, such as OXT, are release
from LDCVs from any part of the neuron, including dendrites and en passant axonal synapses
(Chini et al., 2017; Leng and Ludwig, 2008; Morris and Pow, 1988). Accordingly, axonal termini
of hypothalamic magnocellular OXT neurons converge into the neurohypophysis, where they
form numerous en passant synapses in a form of highly dense axonal varicosities, also known
as axonal swellings or Herring bodies (Tweedle et al., 1989). These structures have been

identified as bona fide synapses that store OXT-containing LDCV and release them upon
physiological demand (Miyata et al., 2001; Wittkowski and Brinkmann, 1974). Thus, in this
manuscript, the term “synapses” will henceforth refer to these neurohypophyseal axonal
swellings.
Here we used a combination of transgenic zebrafish OXT-specific reporters allowing
monitoring and quantification of synaptic OXT levels. We associate between synaptic actin
state and OXT accumulation at the site of release. We further show that Robo2-Cdc42
signaling, which has previously been associated with modulation of actin polymerization in
the growth cones of guided axons, regulates synaptic actin state and OXT neuropeptide
accumulation in the neurohypophyseal termini.

Results
Quantitative analysis of synaptic OXT neuropeptide levels in vivo
The optically transparent zebrafish larva has a few dozens of OXT neurons, which enables
analyzing the function of each neuron down to the single-synapse resolution in the context of
a living vertebrate animal (Blechman et al., 2011; Gutnick et al., 2011). To visualize and
quantify synaptic OXT neuropeptide content at the resolution of a single synapse, we
combined anti-OXT antibody staining with a transgenic reporter zebrafish, Tg(oxt:EGFP), in
which neurohypophyseal OXT synapses are filled with cytoplasmic EGFP (Fig. 1A). In this
manner, the structure of the synapse itself, labelled by EGFP, could be differentiated from it´s
content of oxytocinergic LDCVs, labelled by the anti-OXT antibody. We used image
thresholding settings that allowed detection of individual EGFP-labelled synapses and their
neuropeptide content, which appeared in the form of immune-reactive OXT puncta that
colocalized with these EGFP-labelled synapses (Fig. 1A and Figure 1—video supplement 1).
To validate our detection method, we subjected the fish to hypertonic osmotic challenge
(25% sea salt) (Fig. 1B), which is known to induce the release of oxytocin and vasopressin and,
consequently reduced neuropeptide content in the pituitary of both mammals and fish
(Balment et al., 1980; Huang et al., 1996; Leng and Russell, 2018; Pierson et al., 1995). We
detected several hundreds of synapses and OXT-stained puncta in the neurohypophysis of
naïve 8 days post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae. While the number of these EGFP-positive
synapses remained unaltered following acute hypertonic challenge, synaptic and OXT puncta
volumes were decreased (Fig. 1C-F). Recovery of larvae from hypertonic to isotonic condition
(for 1 hour) led to reversal of the observed phenotypes, namely increase in size of the

synapses and OXT puncta (Fig. 1D and F). These results are in agreement with the reported
hypertonicity-induced cell shrinking mechanisms essential for osmosensation in these
neurons (Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2014).
To further validate our method, we demonstrated that inhibition of tonic OXT release by
oxytocin neurons-specific expression of botulinum toxin, which cleave the vesicle-associated
membrane protein (VAMP) thereby inhibiting LDCVs synaptic release. We utilized a
conditional triple transgenic line Tg(oxt:Gal4; UAS:NTR-mCherry; UAS:BoTxLCC-GFP), in which
synaptic vesicle release from OXT neurons was blocked due to intracellular expression of
botulinum toxin light chain B (BoTxLCB) fused to GFP (Sternberg et al., 2016), and the
synapses were labelled via mCherry (Fig.1G). OXT-specific expression of BoTxLCB lead to
increased volume of OXT puncta, but without affecting the number and volume of the
synapses, indicative of accumulation of OXT content (Fig. 1H-K). We conclude that the above
methodology can faithfully quantify synaptic neuropeptide homeostasis in vivo.
Disruption of F-actin affects axonal swellings size and OXT neuropeptide content
To study the spatial relationship between actin and synaptic OXT neuropeptide we
performed super-resolution microscopy of a double transgenic line, Tg(oxt:Gal4; UAS:LifeactEGFP), in which the filamentous actin (F-actin) probe, Lifeact-EGFP, was specifically expressed
in OXT neurons. Tg(oxt:Gal4; UAS:Lifeact-EGFP) larvae were immunostained with antibodies
against EGFP and endogenous OXT and imaged using stochastic optical reconstruction
microscopy (STORM) (Fig. 2A-D). Imaging revealed various characteristics of actin and
neuropeptides. Lifeact-EGFP signal exhibited a cage-like structure engulfing OXT in
neurohypophyseal synapses (Fig. 2B,C and Fig. 2 - supplemental video 1). In some synapses,
actin-associated neuropeptides were observed only in the synaptic periphery, suggesting that
the actin- coated vesicles are associated with the plasma membrane of such synapses (Fig.
2D). These results are in agreement with previous reports that actin filaments form a cagelike structure associated with synaptic vesicles thus restricting the mobility of these vesicles
(Hirokawa et al., 1989; Miyamoto, 1995).
To investigate the role of actin in capture of oxytocin vesicles in hypophyseal synapses, we
perturbed the hypophyseal synaptic actin filaments by using the actin depolymerizing agent
cytochalasin D (Cooper, 1987). Transgenic Tg(oxt:EGFP) larvae were treated with cytochalasin
D between 4 and 5 days post-fertilization at a concentration of 400nM, which is a tolerated
dose that allows normal development and viability of zebrafish larvae (Trendowski et al.,

2014). Subsequent analysis revealed that the number and size of the synaptic axonal swellings
was reduced upon cytochalasin D treatment (Fig. 2E,F), which is in agreement with the
involvement of F-actin in regulating the synaptic morphology (Zhang and Benson, 2001).
Cytochalasin D treatment also affected both the number and volume of OXT puncta (Fig.
2G,H). These results suggest that actin polymerization is required for axonal swelling
morphogenesis as well as for homeostasis of synaptic OXT neuropeptide content.
Robo2 regulates synaptic actin state and OXT accumulation
Next, we searched for candidate signalling pathways that could regulate axonal F-actin in
OXT neurons. Robo2 is localized to axonal growth cones and is known to regulate axonal
guidance by modulating actin dynamics via other actin interacting regulatory proteins (Kidd
et al., 1998; Slovakova et al., 2012). Fluorescent in situ hybridization of robo2 mRNA showed
that Robo2 is expressed in OXT neurons (Fig. 3A). To investigate if Robo2 regulates synaptic
actin state, we used the zebrafish robo2-deficient mutant, astray [robo2272z/272z (Fricke et al.,
2001)], to perform fluorescence recovering after photobleaching (FRAP) on individual OXT
synapses expressing the F-actin sensor Tg(oxt:Gal4;UAS:Lifeact-EGFP) in either robo2+/+ or
robo2-/- animals (Fig.3B,C). We reasoned that the dynamics of Lifeact-EGFP fluorescence
recovery indicates changes in synaptic polymerized actin, which is available for Lifeact-EGFP
binding. Thus, it is expected that synapses wherein actin filaments are highly stable would
display an increased time of Lifeact-EGFP fluorescence recovery. Indeed, in comparison to the
robo2+/+ zebrafish, the recovery of Lifeact-EGFP fluorescence was attenuated in OXT
synapses of robo2-/-mutants (Fig. 3D), which exhibited decreased dynamic Lifeact-EGFP
fraction and increased stable fraction (Fig. 3E,F). This suggests that Robo2 signalling regulates
synaptic actin state of neurohypophyseal OXT neurons.
We next asked if Robo2 plays a role in synaptic accumulation of OXT by examining whether
neurohypophyseal neuropeptide content is altered in the robo2-defiecient mutant zebrafish.
We found that the volume of OXT puncta was smaller in robo2-/- fish compared to WT
controls, while the number and size of axonal swellings were largely unaffected, suggesting
that Robo2 is required to maintain synaptic oxytocin levels without affecting synaptic
morphogenesis (Fig. 4A-D). This phenotype was not due to OXT axonal guidance deficits, as
the number of neurohypophyseal OXT axonal projections was similar between robo2-/- and
robo2+/+ fish larvae (Fig. 4E).

To visualize OXT neuropeptide dynamics in real time, we developed a novel transgenic tool,
Tg[oxt:OXTSP-EGFP-OXT-NP], in which OXT promoter drives the expression of EGFP fused with
the OXT precursor, between the signal sequence and the OXT peptide (Fig. 4F). Efficient
generation of a cleaved EGFP-OXT fusion protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis of
pituitary synaptosomes isolated from adult pituitaries of transgenic fish (Fig. 4G). The
vesicular synaptic expression of the EGFP-OXT fusion protein was validated by triple coimmunostaining of the transgenic EGFP-tagged product, together with two specific antibodies
to the endogenous neurophysin and OXT, which revealed that the EGFP-tagged OXT transgene
mainly co-localized with the mature (i.e. cleaved and cyclised) OXT neuropeptide (Fig. 4H and
(Fig.4 – Fig. supplement 1)). As expected, in some cases, the OXT-GFP reporter co-localized
with vesicles containing both cleaved and OXT-neurophysin protein, suggesting that it
reported an intermediate step in the process (Fig. 4H). To verify the vesicular synaptic
localization of the EGFP-tagged OXT we performed super-resolution microscopy (STORM)
imaging of Tg[oxt:OXTSP-EGFP-OXT-NP] larvae. Our results showed that similar to the
endogenous OXT, the EGFP-OXT reporter exhibited a clustered organization, indicative of
large dense core vesicular organization of OXT (Fig. 4I,J and Supplement video 1).
To assess the vesicular mobility and monitor in vivo neuropeptide homeostasis using our
novel transgenic tool, we performed FRAP analysis of individual neurohypophyseal swellings
using two-photon microscopy in live 6- days post-fertilization transgenic Tg[oxt:OXTSP-EGFPOXT-NP] larvae (Fig. 4K). Upon bleaching, we observed gradual recovery of OXT-EGFP
fluorescence indicating the mobilization of transiting OXT-loaded vesicles in the synapses. The
extent of fluorescence recovery was low (13%), suggesting that the majority of the bleached
OXT-EGFP-positive vesicles were stationary and not mobile (Fig. 4L). FRAP analysis in
transgenic larvae on the background of robo2 mutants revealed that the fluorescence
recovery rate in robo2-/- mutants, was significantly lower than in robo2+/+ larvae (Fig. 4M).
Taken together, these results suggest that Robo2-mediated signaling regulates actin dynamics
as well as the accumulation of oxytocin-containing vesicles in neurohypophyseal synapses.
Robo2 and Cdc42 regulate OXT neuropeptide levels
We hypothesized that Robo2 exerts its effect on OXT content via actin polymerization;
thus we search for a candidate signalling mediator that could link between these two Robo2mediated processes. Robo signalling is known to affect the transition of the Rho-GTPase
protein Cdc42 from GTP- to GDP- bound state, resulting in decreased actin polymerization
(Wong et al., 2001). We therefore tested if conditional OXT-specific expression of dominant7

negative (i.e. GDP-bound) mutant form of CDC42, termed Cdc42(T17N), would affect synaptic
OXT content and whether the effect would be dampened in a Robo2 mutant. We used our
Tg(oxt:Gal4) transgenic driver to drive specific oxytocinergic expression of EGFP-Cdc42(T17N)
fusion protein, which was regulated by ten Gal4 DNA binding UAS repeats (Ando et al., 2013).
Thus, one cell-stage embryos were co-injected with transposon-based DNA constructs
harboring oxt:Gal4 together with either UAS:EGFP-Cdc42-T17N or UAS:EGFP construct as a
control. (Fig. 5A). We then quantified OXT content and EGFP-Cdc42(T17N) protein in each
synapse (Fig. 5B). We took advantage of the variable expression of the injected construct in
each individual synapse, to examine whether differences in OXT content correlated with
expression levels of EGFP-Cdc42(T17N) or the control EGFP. Regression analysis of OXT
fluorescence as a function of EGFP fluorescence in each injected zebrafish larvae showed that
high EGFP fluorescence led to decreased OXT levels in both robo2+/+ and robo2-/- larvae (Fig.
5C; p<0.01, adj. R2=0.93 and 0.85 respectively) (Fig. 5C). This effect is likely due to
overexpression of the untethered EGFP. In contrast, expression levels of EGFP-Cdc42(T17N)
are positively correlated with increased OXT content in robo2+/+ (Fig. 5D; p<0.01, adj.
R2=0.74). However, the positive effect of EGFP-Cdc42(T17N) on synaptic OXT content was
dampened in robo2-/- mutants (Fig. 5D; p=0.35, Adj. R2=0.52), a finding which is consistent
with the fact that Robo2 inactivation leads to increased levels of active GTP-bound Cdc42 .
These results place the small GTPase Cdc42, which is a key regulator of actin dynamics, in a
Robo2 signalling cascade that controls the levels synaptic OXT neuropeptide (Fig. 5E).
Discussion
To maintain body homeostasis, neurons sense and integrate a multitude of environmental
and physiological signals and evoke a response when a deviation is detected. To achieve this,
neurosecretory synapses of these cells must maintain adequate levels of neuropeptides that
are readily primed to be secreted. This is particularly relevant for neuroendocrine signals that
occur at the neurohypophysis level where two neuropeptides that are essential for
homeostasis, oxytocin and vasopressin, are released into the blood circulation to exert their
effects on peripheral organs (Miyata, 2017; Wircer et al., 2016). Thus, how neuropeptides
homeostasis is maintained in such synapses is a fundamental question. In this study, we
focused on OXT neuropeptide, which is stored in LDCVs in numerous axonal swellings. These
swellings act as en passant synapses, which are highly enriched in neurohypophyseal axonal
projections (Morris and Pow, 1988). We found that local actin dynamics in those synapses
regulate the levels of OXT neuropeptide. We also identified a new signal transduction

machinery, Robo2/Cdc42, which regulates synaptic actin state to maintain steady-state OXT
content in those synapses.
The majority of reported studies on synaptic OXT content and release were performed on
organotypic cultures or by electron microscopy on sliced neurohypophyseal tissues (Alonso et
al., 1981; Miyata et al., 2001; Tobin and Ludwig, 2007). Monitoring synaptic OXT content in
the transparent zebrafish larvae, we were able to study OXT dynamics in the context of a living
vertebrate animal without invasive manipulation. We demonstrated the robustness and
validity of our experimental system by showing that synaptic OXT content is depleted upon
osmotic challenge, which is in agreement with previous studies done in mammals and also in
teleost fish (Alonso et al., 1981; Balment et al., 1980; Neumann et al., 1993; Pierson et al.,
1995). Conversely, expression of light chain of botulinum toxin serotype B specifically in the
OXT neurons, led to increased synaptic OXT content. This is in agreement with the fact that
neurohypophyseal neurons exhibit spontaneous activity and SNARE-mediated synaptic
release, which is blocked by the botulinum toxin serotype B (Jurgutis et al., 1996; Tobin et al.,
2012).
It was reported that dual pools of actin filaments exist in synapses, a cytoplasmic pool
associated with the vesicles and a second pool of cortical filaments associated with the plasma
membrane (Alonso et al., 1981; Bleckert et al., 2012). Using super-resolution STORM
microscopy, we observed that actin filaments form cage-like structures that surround OXTcontaining vesicles. We also observed that actin and OXT exhibit a synaptic Colocalization,
possibly forming a readily releasable pool. Our results are in agreement with EM-based studies
on rat neurohypophyseal axonal termini (Alonso et al., 1981). As neuropeptides (e.g. OXT)
synapses lack active zone, which is typical in small transmitters synapses, the actin cage may
regulate vesicle movement and exocytosis. Indeed, synaptic OXT content was decreased upon
treatment of zebrafish larvae with cytochalasin D, a cell permeable mycotoxin known to
inhibit F-actin formation (Cooper, 1987; Goddette and Frieden, 1986; Lin et al., 1980).
Synaptic actin filaments are dynamic structures undergoing treadmilling and regulating
synaptic morphogenesis (Bosch and Hayashi, 2012; Honkura et al., 2008). Actin dynamics was
shown to play a role in vesicle clustering in cerebral cortex synapses (Wolf et al., 2015). Using
FRAP analysis of the F-actin probe Lifeact-GFP in OXT synapses of live animals, we found that
actin state is perturbed in robo2 mutants. Thus, robo2 mutants exhibit reduced mobile LifeactGFP fraction and increased stable fraction, which was correlated to reduced OXT content in
those synapses. Notably, previous studies have shown that Robo2 signalling regulates actin

dynamics during neuronal migration and axonal guidance (Kidd et al., 1998; Slovakova et al.,
2012; Wong et al., 2001). However, the changes in neurohypophyseal OXT content, which we
observed in robo2 -/- fish were not accompanied by axon guidance defects as the number of
neurohypophyseal projecting axons were unaffected.
In view of our findings regarding the involvement of Robo2 in synaptic actin state and OXT
content, we hypothesized that changes in synaptic actin mobility regulate the steady-state
accumulation of OXT-containing vesicles at the neurohypophyseal release site. To directly test
this hypothesis we established a novel transgenic OXT-EGFP fusion line, allowing real time in
vivo monitoring of the dynamicity of OXT-loaded vesicles. Notably, transgenic rats harbouring
a similar OXT-EGFP fusion have already been reported (Hashimoto et al., 2014); however, the
deep anatomical location of the neurohypophysis makes it difficult to study the dynamic subcellular processes in vivo. Using our zebrafish transgenic reporter, we revealed that Robo2
regulates the accumulation of transiting OXT-loaded vesicles in the synapses. Whether this
phenotype is due to decreased vesicle capture or increased exocytosis needs to be further
investigated. Interestingly, the majority of the vesicles were immobile, as only ~10% of nonbleached fluorescent vesicles exchanged into the photobleached synapses. This finding is in
agreement with previous work on LDCV mobility in Drosophila neuroendocrine termini
(Bulgari et al., 2014).
To link synaptic actin dynamics to neuropeptide content we targeted the intercellular
GTPase Cdc42, which acts downstream of Robo signalling pathway to affect actin dynamics.
During neuronal migration, Robo signalling promotes Cdc42-GTP hydrolysis that, in turn,
attenuates actin polymerization (Wong et al., 2001). We show here that expression of the
dominant-negative (i.e. GDP-bound) Cdc42(T17N) in OXT synapses led to increased OXT levels
in WT fish in a dose-dependent manner. However, robo2 mutant was somewhat refractory to
the effect of Cdc42(T17N) on synaptic OXT levels, suggesting that Robo2 acts upstream of
Cdc42 in the context of synaptic OXT content. This result is consistent with the notion that
lack of Robo2 signalling leads to decreased levels of active GTP-bound Cdc42 (Wong et al.,
2001). Our findings regarding the regulation of synaptic OXT content might be relevant to
other neuropeptidergic and also endocrine cells. Thus, interaction between Cdc42 and vesicleassociated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) was previously shown in the case of insulin granules
in pancreatic beta cells (Nevin and Thormond, 2015). These authors suggested that a
mechanism whereby glucose activates Cdc42 to induce the targeting of intracellular Cdc42-

Materials and Methods
Animals
Zebrafish were raised and bred according to standard protocols. All experimental
procedures were approved by the Weizmann Institute's Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC). Animals were genotyped by Sanger sequencing. Transgenic zebrafish
lines Tg(oxt:EGFP)wz01 (Blechman et al., 2011), Tg(oxt:gal4)wz06 (Anbalagan et al., 2018),
Tg(UAS:Lifeact-EGFP)mu271 (Helker et al., 2013), Tg(UAS:BotxLCB-EGFP)icm21 (Sternberg et al.,
2016), Tg(UAS:NTR-mCherry)c264 (Davison et al., 2007) and robo2ti272z (Fricke et al., 2001) were
used in this study. See key resources table for oligonucleotide details.
Transgenesis experiments
We used the Tol2kit transposon-based transgenic vector system for site-specific
recombination-based cloning (Kwan et al., 2007) and generated all plasmid DNA constructs.
To generate OXTSP-EGFP-OXT construct, sequences were fused by overlap extension PCR and
cloned into middle entry Tol2 plasmid 218. The resulting plasmid was recombined
downstream of oxt promoter in Tol2 pDEST 395 plasmid. The resulting plasmid was coinjected
with Tol2 transposase mRNA and founders were outcrossed to obtain germline transmitting
lines Tg(oxt:OXTSP-EGFP-OXT; myl7:EGFP)wz14.
Salt challenge
8- days post-fertilization (dpf) transgenic Tg(oxt:EGFP)wz01 larvae were treated with 25%
artificial sea water (1.75 g Instant ocean Sea salt in 200 mL Danieau buffer) for a period of 60
min and then washed and returned to Danieau’s medium for additional 60 min. The larvae
were incubated at 28°C during entire procedure and larvae were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at
4C prior to immunostaining.
Actin perturbation
For temporal inhibition of actin filaments, a 100 µM stock of cytochalasin D (Sigma C8273)
was prepared in DMSO. Briefly, 15-20 Tg(oxt:EGFP) 4-dpf larvae were treated with

For spatial perturbation of Cdc42 signalling in oxytocin neurons, Tg(oxt:gal4) embryos
were micro-injected with vector oxt:gal4 in combination with 10xUAS:EGFP or
10xUAS:cdc42(T17N)-EGFP (Ando et al., 2013). All the plasmids were injected at a
concentration of 20 ng/μl each and with transposase mRNA at a concentration of 20 ng/μl
(~500 pl/embryo). Using this method, we were able to attain cell labelling in ~10% of the
surviving embryos. 8-dpf larvae that expressed the additionally expressed EGFP heart marker
were sorted and fixed in 4% PFA prior to immunostaining. Due to the mosaic nature of the
transgenesis experiments and sparse labelling of OXT neurons projecting to the hypophysis
(<5% of mosaic clones), transgenesis experiments were performed separately for UAS:EGFP
and UAS:Cdc42(T17N)-EGFP constructs.
In situ Hybridization
RNA in situ hybridization was performed as described in (Machluf and Levkowitz, 2011). For
probe synthesis, partial coding sequences and 3' UTR of the genes were amplified by PCR,
along with a T7 tail in the reverse primer, and purified with PCR cleanup kit. The purified
products served as a template to synthesize digoxigenin-labelled antisense mRNA probes
using DIG RNA labelling mix (Roche #11277073910).
Immunofluorescent staining
For immunofluorescent staining, PFA-fixed larvae were washed in PBS (2x10 min),
dehydrated using methanol series (25-50-75-100%) and stored at -20°C overnight. The
samples were rehydrated from methanol (75-50-25%) to PBS, washed in PBS-Tx (Triton X100,
0.3%; 2x10 min) and blocked in 500 µL of blocking solution (PBS + 10% goat serum + 1% DMSO
+ 0.3% Triton X100) for 30 min at room temperature. The solution was then replaced with 200
µL of fresh blocking solution with primary antibodies at 1:200 concentration and incubated
overnight at 4°C. Samples were washed with PBS-Tx (3x30 min) and treated with 200 µL of
secondary antibodies in blocking solution at 1:200 concentration, overnight at 4°C. Then,
samples were washed with PBS-Tx (3x30 min), transferred to 75% glycerol (25-50-75%) and
the jaws were removed before mounting the larvae ventrally. Rabbit anti-EGFP (ThermoFisher
A11122), Guinea Pig anti-OXT (Peninsula labs T-5021) and secondary antibodies were
obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA).

Confocal imaging and image analysis
Samples were imaged by using Zeiss LSM 710 or LSM800 confocal microscopes with oil
immersion 40X objective. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) images of the whole Z-stacks
or subset of Z-stacks were generated using the Zen software (Zeiss). Processing of multiple
channel images (i.e., linear adjustments of brightness, contrast and levels) was performed on
individual channels using Photoshop CS7 Extended (Adobe). Images were analysed using the
open source Fiji image-processing package and Volocity (Perkin Elmer). The number of
hypophyseal synapses and OXT puncta was quantified using object measurement tool in
Volocity (PerkinElmer) object identifier tool (thresholding was based on SD of fluorescence
>=4; size of 0.2 to 25µm3). The data were extracted and analysed using R (Team, 2013).
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and image analysis
For live imaging of synaptic Lifeact-EGFP dynamics, 6-dpf live embryos were mounted
dorsally in 0.1% low-melt agarose in a 12-mL plate and immersed in Danieau buffer with 0.3%
tricaine to prevent movement of the larvae during imaging. The larvae were let to acclimatize
for 30 minutes prior to imaging. FRAP experiments were performed using Zeiss LSM 2MP
multiphoton microscope with 20X water objective of 1.0 numerical aperture and Chameleon
Ti-Sapphire laser (Coherent). The acquisition region was 116 x 116 pixels (28.34 µm2), and
interval between scanning was 0.35 s at a pixel dwell of 1.76 µs. Four circular ROI of 10 x 10
pixels encircling the synapses were selected for each larva, 3 of them for bleach and 1 for
control. Another ROI of similar size was chosen outside the synapses for background
quantification. 20 prebleach images were taken and bleach was performed at 75% laser power
for 15 iterations and 200 postbleach images were taken.
For live imaging of synaptic OXT-EGFP, embryos were mounted and imaged as described
above except for time-lapse parameters. Laser was used at 940 nm 2.5%. The acquisition
region was 128 x 64 pixels (14.17 µm x 7.08 µm) and interval between scanning was 1 s at a
pixel dwell of 3.15 µs. Two circular ROI of 10 x 10 pixels encircling the synapses were selected
for each larva, 1 for bleach and 1 for control. Another ROI of similar size was chosen outside
the synapses for background quantification. 20 prebleach images were taken and bleach was
performed at 75% laser power and 300 postbleach images were taken. Fluorescence images
were drift corrected in Image/Fiji using TurboReg plugin (Thevenaz et al., 1998).
The FRAP values were analysed using EasyFRAP software with full scale normalization to
account of difference in synaptic OXT-EGFP fluorescence (Rapsomaniki et al., 2012).

Dual color three-dimensional STORM Imaging
For STORM imaging, 5-dpf Tg(oxt:EGFP) or Tg(oxt:OXTSP-EGFP-OXT) embryos were
immunostained with anti-OXT (1:200) or anti-EGFP (1:200) as described above. For
visualization of actin and OXT, Tg(oxt:gal4; UAS:Lifeact-EGFP) larvae were fixed and stained
with primary antibodies anti-Neurophysin (PS45) and anti-EGFP at 1:200. Secondary antibody
(Alexa 647 or 568, Invitrogen) was used at a concentration at 1:2000. Samples were mounted
ventrally without the jaws, and soaked in imaging buffer (50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glucose), 1x Gloxy for 15 min prior to imaging. 50X
Gloxy buffer was made by making 8440 AU glucose oxidase (Sigma #G2133, 50 KU) and 70200
AU catalase (Sigma C40, 100 mg) in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mM NaCl. Samples were
imaged using Vutara SR-200 super-resolution microscope (Bruker). AlexaFluor647 was excited
with 640 nm laser (power range of 4-9 kW/cm2), AlexaFluor568 was excited with 561 nm laser
(6 kW/cm2) and 405-nm activation laser power was ramped slowly to maintain optimal singlemolecule density. Images were recorded using a 60x, NA 1.2 water immersion objective
(Olympus) and Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics) with gain set at 50, frame rate at 50
Hz. Total number of frames acquired was 6000 per labeling dye. Data were analyzed by the
Vutara SRX software.
Western blot
To validate the expression of OXT-EGFP fusion, adult pituitary of transgenic reporter
Tg(oxt:SP-EGFP-OXT) were dissected and protein extracts were isolated. As controls,
Tg(oxt:EGFP) pituitary extracts were isolated. Western blotting was performed on isolated
protein extracts using anti-EGFP antibodies at 1:1000.
Statistical analysis
Custom-written R codes were used for analysis of axonal swelling and OXT puncta data.
For volume analysis, the values were log-transformed and the mean values were calculated
for individual fish. Statistical test were performed between the mean volumes between
different genotypes or perturbations. Normality tests were performed and Students’ t-test or
Mann-Whitney test or ANOVA were performed.
The correlation between the mean log-transformed (log10) fluorescence value of OXT
puncta and EGFP axonal swelling was tested with a linear regression model (ANCOVA),
accounting for the effect of EGFP axonal swelling, and individual fish.

in Figure 1. Treatment with cytochalasin D led to decreased number of neurohypophyseal
synapses (NS) (E) and associated OXT puncta (G) and decreased mean volume of NS (F) and
associated OXT puncta (H) (E-H; P<0.01; Student’s t-test; n= 8, 12 for DMSO and cytochalasin
D treatment respectively).

Figure 4 with 2 supplements
Robo2 is required to regulate synaptic OXT levels
(A-E) Assessment of synaptic oxytocin content in robo2 mutant was performed as
described in Figure 1. Graph showing the number and size of neurohypophyseal synapses (NS)
(A,B) and colocalizing OXT puncta (C,D) and the number of neurohypophyseal projecting
axons (E) in 8-days post-fertilization (dpf) robo2+/+ (n=13) vs robo2-/- (n=17) larvae (* p<0.05;
ns denotes not significant, Student’s t-test).
(F) Schematic of novel transgenic OXT tool Tg(oxt:OXT-SP-EGFP-OXT), in which oxt
promoter drives expression of Oxytocin precursor protein with an internally-tagged EGFP at
the C-terminus of the signal peptide.
(G) Validation of OXT-fusion EGFP protein expression by Western blot analysis. Pituitary
protein extracts from adult Tg(oxt:OXT-SP-EGFP-OXT), TL (control) and Tg(oxt:EGFP) zebrafish
were immunoblotted using anti-GFP.
(H) Validation of OXT-fusion EGFP protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Confocal
Z-stack images of the neurohypophyseal area of 5-dpf transgenic Tg(oxt:OXT-SP-EGFP-OXT)
larvae. Larvae were stained using anti-GFP, anti-OXT and anti-neurophysin antibodies. Scale
bar: 1 µm.
(I-J) Assessment of endogenous vs OXT-fusion EGFP protein localization and packaging by
super-resolution microscopy. STORM Z-stack images of the endogenous synaptic OXT (I) in
comparison to OXT-EGFP fusion in transgenic Tg(oxt:OXT-SP-EGFP-OXT) larvae (J). 5 dpf larvae
were stained with either anti-OXT (I) or anti-GFP (J) antibodies and visualized by STORM as
described in the Method section. Scale bar:. The right panels I’ and J’ show magnifications of
the represented areas outlined in I and J. Scale bars: 1 µm 200 nm (I’ and J’). Colour code
indicates Z-axis depth.
(K,L) Real-time monitoring of synaptic oxytocin vesicle dynamics in live transgenic
reporter Tg(oxt:OXT-SP-EGFP-OXT) larvae. Schemata of the experimental design (K): 6 dpf
larvae were mounted dorsally in low-melt agarose gel, submerged in E3 embryo buffer and
imaged using multi-photon microscopy. Neurohypophyseal synapses containing OXT-EGFP
vesicles were photobleached and the fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching (FRAP) over
time was monitored. The fluorescent recovery occurs due to the dynamic exchange of mobile
and unbleached OXT-EGFP vesicles from neighbouring en passant synapses over time (t=1-5
min). The brightness and contrast of the images were increased to visualize the individual
pixels (L). Scale bar: 200 nm.
(M) Graph showing neuropeptide accumulation (normalized FRAP curves) of OXT-EGFP in
6-dpf robo2+/+ (n=24) vs robo2-/- (n=41) neurohypophyseal synapses (*P<0.05, two-way
ANOVA). Neuropeptide accumulation represents full scale normalized data to account for
differences in synaptic OXT-EGFP fluorescence, i.e. fluorescent values upon photobleaching
were normalized to zero.
Error bars indicate SEM in (A-E and M).

Figure 5. Robo2 regulates synaptic OXT levels via Cdc42.
(A,B) Assessment of the effect of Oxytocin neuron-specific overexpression of actinregulating protein Cdc42 in Tg(oxt:Gal4) larvae. Transgenic embryos expressing the oxt:Gal4
driver were injected with transposon-based transgenic vectors containing either control
UAS:EGFP or UAS:Cdc42(T17N)-EGFP. Larvae were fixed at 8 days post-fertilization (dpf) and
immunostained with anti-GFP and anti-OXT antibodies and neurohypophyseal synapse (NS)
were identified as described above. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) reveals mosaic
labelling of hypophyseal projecting axons (B). Below are magnifications of squared areas
showing single stack with colocalization of axonal swelling with OXT puncta. Scale bar 1 µm.
(C,D) Linear regression analysis comparing between synaptic EGFP levels (mean EGFP
puncta) as a function of OXT fluorescence (mean OXT puncta). The data were normalized
using mean-centering approach using the scale function in the “R” software. Each line
represents a regression line of single animal. The correlation between the mean (log10)
fluorescence value of OXT puncta and GFP expression in neurohypophyseal synapse was
tested with a linear regression model (ANCOVA), accounting for the effect of GFP
fluorescence, and individual fish. Mean EGFP fluorescence is inversely correlated with OXT
fluorescence in robo2+/+ (n=5; p<0.01, adj. R2=0.93) and in robo2-/- (n=8; and p<0.01, adj.
R2=0.85) (C). Mean EGFP-Cdc42(T17N) fluorescence positively correlates with OXT
fluorescence in robo2+/+ (n=7; p<0.01, adj. R2=0.74) larvae but not in in robo2-/- (n=7; p=0.35,
Adj. R2=0.52) (D).
(E) Model of the role of Robo2 in neurohypophyseal synapses: Synaptic Robo signalling
inactivates Cdc42 via GAP by affecting the transition of the Rho-GTPase protein Cdc42 from
GTP- to GDP- bound state. Cdc42 inactivation reduces actin polymerization and increases
synaptic OXT content.
