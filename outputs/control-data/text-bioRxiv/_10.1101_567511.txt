ABSTRACT
Background
In 2005, England changed from universal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination of
school-age children to targeted BCG vaccination of high-risk children at birth.
Methods
We combined notification data from the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system, with
demographic data from the Labour Force Survey to construct retrospective cohorts of
individuals in England relevant to both the universal, and targeted vaccination
programmes between Jan 1, 2000 and Dec 31, 2010. For each cohort, we estimated
incidence rates over a 5 year follow-up period and used Poisson and Negative Binomial
regression models in order to estimate the impact of the change in policy on TB.
Results In the non-UK born, we found evidence for an association between a reduction in
incidence rates and the change in BCG policy (school-age IRR: 0.74 (95%CI 0.61, 0.88),
neonatal IRR: 0.62 (95%CI 0.44, 0.88)). We found some evidence that the change in BCG
policy was associated with a increase in incidence rates in the UK born school-age
population (IRR: 1.08 (95%CI 0.97, 1.19)) and weaker evidence of an association with a
reduction in incidence rates in UK born neonates (IRR: 0.96 (95%CI 0.82, 1.14)). Overall,
we found that the change in BCG policy was associated with directly preventing 385 (95%
CI -105, 881) TB cases.
Conclusions
Withdrawing universal vaccination at school-age and targeting BCG vaccination towards
high-risk neonates was associated with reduced incidence of TB in England. This was
largely driven by reductions in the non-UK born. There was a slight increase in UK born
school-age cases.
Keywords:

Key Messages
•

There is little existing literature on the impact of withdrawing universal school-age
BCG vaccination and introducing high-risk neonatal BCG vaccination on TB incidence
rates in the populations directly affected by the vaccination programmes.

•

There was strong evidence that the change in policy was associated with a decrease in
TB incidence rates in non-UK born neonates and school-age children. In the UK born
individuals, there was some evidence that the change in policy was associated with an
increase in TB incidence rates in those relevant to the universal school-age scheme,
with little evidence of a decrease in incidence rates in those relevant to the high-risk
neonatal vaccination scheme.

Overall the change in vaccination policy was associated with preventing TB cases,
mainly in the non-UK born.

These results provide an important evaluation of the direct effects of both
withdrawing and implementing a BCG vaccination programme in a low incidence, high
income, country and are relevant to several other countries that have made similar
changes to their vaccination programmes.

INTRODUCTION
In 2005 England changed its Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy against
tuberculosis (TB) from a universal programme aimed at 13 and 14 year olds to a targeted
programme aimed at high-risk neonates. High risk babies are identified by local TB
incidence and by the parents’ and grandparents’ country of origin. The change in policy was
motivated by evidence of reduced TB transmission,(1–3) and high effectiveness of the BCG
vaccine in children,(4–6) and variable effectiveness in adults.(7) Little work has been done
to evaluate the impact of this change in vaccination policy.
Globally, several countries with low TB incidence have moved from universal vaccination,
either of those at school-age or neonates, to targeted vaccination of neonates considered at
high-risk of TB.(8) In Sweden, which discontinued universal vaccination of neonates in
favour of targeted vaccination of those at high risk, incidence rates in Swedish-born
children increased slightly after the change in policy. (9) In France, which also switched
from universal vaccination of neonates to targeted vaccination of those at high-risk, a study
found that targeted vaccination of neonates may have reduced coverage in those most at
risk.(10)
The number of TB notifications in England increased from 6929 in 2004 to 8280 in 2011
but has since declined to 5137 in 2017.(1) A recent study found that this reduction may be
linked to improved TB interventions.(11) Directly linking trends in TB incidence to
transmission is complex because after an initial infection an individual may either develop
active disease, or enter a latent stage which then may later develop into active disease.
Incidence in children is a proxy of TB transmission, because any active TB disease in this
population is attributable to recent transmission. Using this approach it is thought that TB
transmission has been falling in England for the last 5 years, a notion supported by strain
typing.(1) However, this does not take into account the change in BCG policy, which is
likely to have reduced incidence rates in children.
Although the long term effects of BCG vaccination such as reducing the reactivation of
latent cases and decreasing on-wards transmission are not readily detectable over short
time scales the direct effects of vaccination on incidence rates can be estimated in
vaccinated populations, when compared to comparable unvaccinated populations.(12)
Here, We aimed to estimate the impact of the 2005 change in BCG policy on incidence rates,
in both the UK and non-UK born populations, directly affected by it.

METHODS
Data sources
Data on all notifications from the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance (ETS) system from
Jan 1, 2000 to Dec 31, 2015 were obtained from Public Health England (PHE). The ETS is
maintained by PHE, and contains demographic, clinical, and microbiological data on all
notified cases in England. A descriptive analysis of TB epidemiology in England is published
each year, which fully details data collection and cleaning.(1)
We obtained yearly population estimates from the April to June Labour Force Survey (LFS)
for 2000-2015. The LFS is a study of the employment circumstances of the UK population,
and provides the official measures of employment and unemployment in the UK. Reporting
practices have changed with time so the appropriate variables for age, country of origin,
country of birth, and survey weight were extracted from each yearly extract, standardised,
and combined into a single data-set.
Constructing Retrospective cohorts
We constructed retrospective cohorts of TB cases and individuals using the ETS and the
LFS. TB cases were extracted from the ETS based on date of birth and date of TB
notification.
Cohort 1: individuals aged 14 between 2000 and 2004, who were notified with TB whilst
aged between 14 and 19 years old.
Comparison cohort 1: individuals aged 14 between 2005 and 2010, who were notified with
TB whilst aged between 14 and 19 years old.
Cohort 2: individuals born between 2005 and 2010, who were notified with TB whilst aged
0-5 years old
Comparison cohort 2: individuals born between 2000 and 2004, who were notified with TB
whilst aged 0-5 years old
Each cohort was stratified by UK birth status, with both non-UK born and UK born cases
assumed to have been exposed to England’s vaccination policy. Corresponding population
cohorts were calculated using the LFS population estimates, resulting in 8 population level
cohorts, each with 5 years of follow up (Table 1).

* Eligible signifies that the cohort fit the criteria for the programme and entered the study

Statistical methods
We estimated incidence rates (with 95% confidence intervals) by year, age and place of
birth as (number of cases) divided by (number of individuals of corresponding age). UK
birth status was incomplete, with some evidence of a missing not at random mechanism.
We imputed the missing data using a gradient boosting method (see supplementary
information). We then used descriptive analysis to describe the observed trends in agespecific incidence rates over the study period, comparing incidence rates in the study
populations relevant to both vaccination programmes before and after the change in BCG
policy.
We calculated Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) for the change in incidence rates associated
with the change in BCG vaccination policy (modelled as a binary breakpoint at the start of
2005) for both the UK born and non-UK born populations that were relevant to the
universal programme, and for the targeted programme using a range of models. We
considered the following covariates: age,(1,7) incidence rates in both the UK born and nonUK born who were not in the age group of interest,(1) and year of study entry (as a random
intercept). We first investigated a univariable Poisson model, followed by combinations of
covariates (supplementary table S1). We also investigated a Negative Binomial model
adjusting for the same covariates as in the best fitting Poisson model. The models were
estimated with a Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with default
weakly informative priors (see supplementary information). Model fit, penalised by model
complexity, was assessed using the leave one out cross validation information criterion

(LOOIC) and its standard error.(13) Models were ranked by goodness of fit, using their
LOOIC, with a smaller LOOIC indicating a better fit to the data after adjusting for the
complexity of the model. No formal threshold for a change in the LOOIC was used, with
changes in the LOOIC being evaluated in the context of their standard error. The inclusion
of the change in policy in the best fitting model was tested by refitting the model excluding
the change in policy and estimating the improvment in the LOOIC. Once the best fitting
model had been identified we estimated the number of cases prevented, from 2005 until
2015, for each vaccination programme in the study population relevant to that programme
(see supplementary information).
Implementation
R 3.5.0 was used for all analysis.(14) Missing data imputation using a GBM was
implemented using the h2o package.(15) Incidence rates, with 95% confidence intervals,
were calculated using the epiR package.(16) The brms package,(17) and STAN,(18) was
used to perform MCMC. Models were run until convergence (4 chains with a burn in of
10,000, and 10,000 sampled iterations each), with convergence being assessed using trace
plots and the R hat diagnostic.(18) All numeric confounders were centered and scaled by
their standard deviation, and age was adjusted for using single year of age categories.

RESULTS
Descriptive analysis
During the study period there were 114,820 notifications of TB in England, of which 93%
(106765/114820) had their birth status recorded. Of notifications with a known birth
status 27% (29096/106765) were UK born, in comparison to 33% (2634/8055) in cases
with an imputed birth status. Trends in incidence rates varied by age group and UK birth
status (see supplementary information). During the study period, there were 1729 UK born
cases and 2797 non-UK born cases in individuals relevant to the universal schools scheme,
and 1431 UK born cases and 238 non-UK born cases relevant to the targeted neonatal
scheme, who fit our age criteria. Univariable evidence for differences between mean
incidence rates before and after the change in BCG policy in the UK born was weak. In the
non-UK born incidence rates were lower after the change in BCG policy in both the cohort
relevant to the universal school-age scheme and the cohort relevant to the targeted
neonatal scheme (Figure 1).

Adjusted estimates of the effects of the change in policy on school-age children
In the UK born cohort relevant to universal vaccination there was some evidence, across all
models that adjusted for age, that ending the scheme was associated with a modest
increase in TB rates (Supplementary Table S2). Using the LOOIC goodness of fit criteria the
best fitting model was found to be a Negative Binomial model that adjusted for the change
in policy, age, and incidence rates in the UK born (Table 2). In this model there was some

evidence of an assocation between the change in policy and an increase in incidence rates
in those at school-age who were UK born, with an IRR of 1.08 (95%CI 0.97, 1.19). Dropping
the change in policy from the model resulted in a small decrease in the LOOIC (0.52 (SE
2.63)) but the change was too small, with too large a standard error, to conclusively state
that the excluding the change in policy from the model improved the quality of model fit.
We found that it was important to adjust for UK born incidence rates, otherwise the impact
from the change in BCG vaccination policy was over-estimated.
For the comparable non-UK born cohort who were relevant to the universal vaccination
there was evidence, in the best fitting model, that ending the scheme was associated with a
decrease in incidence rates (IRR: 0.74 (95%CI 0.61, 0.88)). The best fitting model was a
Negative Binomial model which adjusted for the change in policy, age, incidence rates in
the non-UK born, and year of eligibility as a random effect (Table 2). We found omitting
change in policy from the model resulted in poorer model fit (LOOIC increase of 3.02 (SE
3.52)), suggesting that the policy change was an important factor explaining changes in
incidence rates, after adjusting for other covariates. All models that adjusted for incidence
rates in the UK born or non-UK born estimated similar IRRs (Supplementary Table S3).

in policy from the model in the UK born cohort and a -3.02 (SE 3.52) improvement in the nonUK born cohort.
Adjusted estimates of the effect of the change in policy in those relevant to the
targeted neonatal programme
For the UK born cohort relevant to the targeted neonatal vaccination programme the
evidence of an association, across all models, was mixed and credible intervals were wide
compared to models for the UK born cohort relevant to the universal school-age
vaccination programme (Supplementary Table S4). The best fitting model was a Poisson
model which adjusted for the change in policy, age, UK born incidence rates, and year of
study entry with a random effect (Table 3). In this model, there was weak evidence of an
association between the change in BCG policy and an decrease in incidence rates in UK
born neonates, with an IRR of 0.96 (95%CI 0.82, 1.14). There was weak evidence to suggest
that dropping the change in policy from this model improved the quality of the fit, with an
improvement in the LOOIC score of 0.92 (SE 1.07). This suggests that the change in policy
was not an important factor for explaining incidence rates, after adjusting for covariates.
Models which also adjusted for non-UK born incidence rates estimated that the change in
policy was associated with no change in incidence rates in the relevant cohort of neonates.
For the comparable non-UK born cohort who were relevant to the targeted neonatal
vaccination programme there was evidence, across all models, that change in policy was
associated with a large decrease in incidence rates (IRR: 0.62 (95%CI 0.44, 0.88)) (Table 3
in the best fitting model). The best fitting model was a Negative Binomial model that
adjusted for the change in policy, age, and non-UK born incidence rates (Table 3). All
models which at least adjusted for age estimated comparable effects of the change in policy
(Supplementary Table S5).

Magnitude of the estimated impact of the change in BCG policy
We estimate that the change in vaccination policy was associated with preventing 385
(95%CI -105, 881) cases from 2005 until the end of the study period in the directly
impacted populations after 5 years of follow up (Table 4). The majority of the cases
prevented were in the non-UK born, with cases increasing slightly overall in the UK born.
This was due to cases increasing in the UK born at school-age, and decreasing in UK born
neonates, although both these estimates had large credible intervals.

programme in the study population relevant to that programme, using the best fitting model

DISCUSSION
In the non-UK born we found evidence of an association between the change in BCG policy
and a decrease in TB incidence rates in both those at school-age and neonates, after 5 years
of follow up. We found some evidence that the change in BCG policy was associated with a
modest increase in incidence rates in the UK born population who were relevant to the
universal school-age scheme and weaker evidence of a small decrease in incidence rates in
the UK born population relevant to the targeted neonatal scheme. Overall, we found that
the change in policy was associated with preventing 385 (95%CI -105, 881) cases in the
study population, from 2005 until the end of the study period, with the majority of the
cases prevented in the non-UK born.
We were unable to estimate the impact of the change in BCG policy after 5 years post
vaccination, so both our estimates of the positive and negative consequences are likely to
be underestimates of the ongoing impact. Tuberculosis is a complex disease and the BCG
vaccine is known to offer imperfect protection, which has been shown to vary both
spatially and with time since vaccination.(19,20) By focusing on the impact of the change in
policy on the directly affected populations within a short period of time, and by employing
a multi-model approach we have limited the potential impact of these issues. Our study
was based on a routine observational data set (ETS), and a repeated survey (LFS) both of
which may have introduced bias. Whilst the LFS is a robust data source, widely used in
academic studies,(21–23) it is susceptible to sampling errors particularly in the young, and
in the old, which may have biased the estimated incidence rates. As the ETS is routine
surveillance system some level of missing data is inevitable. However, UK birth status is
relatively complete (93% (106765/114820)) and we imputed missing values using an
approach which accounted for MNAR mechanisms for the variables included in the
imputation model. We were unable to adjust for known demographic risk factors for TB,
notably socio-economic status,(24,25) and ethnicity.(24–26) However, this confounding is
likely to be mitigated by our use of multiple cohorts and our adjustment for incidence rates
in the UK born and non-UK born. Finally, we have assumed that the effect we have
estimated for the change in BCG policy is due to the changes in BCG vaccination policy as
well as other associated changes in TB control policy, after adjusting for hypothesised
confounders. However, there may have been additional policy changes which we have not
accounted for.
Whilst little work has been done to assess the impact of the 2005 change in BCG
vaccination several other studies have estimated the impact of changing BCG vaccination
policy, although typically only from universal vaccination of neonates to targeted
vaccination of high-risk neonates. A previous study in Sweden found that incidence rates in
Swedish-born children increased after high-risk neonatal vaccination was implemented in
place of a universal neonatal program, this corresponds with our finding that introducing
neonatal vaccination had little impact on incidence rates in UK born neonates. Theoretical
approaches have indicated that targeted vaccination of those at high-risk may be optimal in
low incidence settings.(27) Our study extends this work by also considering the age of
those given BCG vaccination, although we were unable to estimate the impact of a universal
neonatal scheme as this has never been implemented nationally in England. It has

previously been shown that targeted vaccination programmes may not reach those
considered most at risk,(28) our findings may support this view as we observed only a
small decrease in incidence rates in UK born neonates after the introduction of the targeted
neonatal vaccination programme. Alternatively, the effectiveness of the BCG in neonates, in
England, may be lower than previously thought as we only observed a small decrease in
incidence rates, whilst a previous study estimated BCG coverage at 68% (95%CI 65%,
71%) amongst those eligible for the targeted neonatal vaccination programme.(29)
This study indicates that the change in England’s BCG vaccination policy was associated
with a modest increase in incidence in the UK born that were relevant to the school-age
vaccination programme, and with a small reduction in incidence in the UK born that were
relevant to the high-risk neonatal vaccination programme, although both these estimates
had wide credible intervals. We found stronger evidence of an association between the
change in policy and a decrease in incidence rates in the non-UK born populations relevant
to both programmes. This suggests that the change of vaccination policy to target high-risk
neonates may have resulted in an increased focus on high-risk non-UK born individuals
who may not have been the direct targets of the vaccination programme. Further validation
is required using alternative study designs, but this result should be considered when
vaccination policy changes are being considered.
It is well established that interventions against infectious diseases, such as TB, should be
evaluated not only for their direct effects but also for future indirect effects via ongoing
transmission. Statistical approaches such as those used in this paper are not appropriate
for capturing these future indirect effects, and instead dynamic disease models should be
used. In addition, this study could not evaluate the impact of the neonatal programme on
the high-risk population it targets, due to a lack of reliable data. Improved coverage data
for the BCG programme is required to more fully evaluate its ongoing impact.
