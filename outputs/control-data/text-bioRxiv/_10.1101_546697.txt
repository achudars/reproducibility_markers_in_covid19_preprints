Abstract

13

Background: The incidence of child labour, especially across the developing nations is of

14

global concern. The use of children in employment in developing economies constitutes a

15

major threat to the societies, and concerted efforts are made by the relevant stakeholders

16

towards addressing some of the factors/issues responsible for the menace. Significant risk

17

factors include socio-demographic and economic factors, including poverty, neglect, lack of

18

adequate care, and exposure of children to various grades of violence, parental education

19

status, gender, place of residence, household size, residence's type or size, wealth index,

20

parental survivorship and household size. Objectives: This study, therefore, focuses on

21

identifying socio-demographic/economic and geospatial factors associated with child labour

22

participation. Methods: We utilised 2014 Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) from the

23

Ministry health and Population in Egypt, with the record of 20, 560 never married children

24

aged 5-17years engaging in economic activities, in and out of their home. The data focused

25

on demographic and socio-economic characteristics of household members. Multivariate

26

Bayesian geo-additive models were employed to examine the demographical and socio-

27

economic factors for children working less than 16hrs; between 16 and 45hrs and above

28

45hrours weekly. Results: The results showed that at least 31.6% of the children in the age

29

group from 5-10 were working, 68.5% of children aged 11-17 years engaging in child labour

30

(wage), while 44.7 of the children in the age group from 5-10 were engaged in hazard work.

31

From the multivariate Bayesian geo-additive models, the female children (with male children

32

as reference category) working at least 16hrs (OR: 1.3; with 95% CI: 1.2-1.5) are more likely

33

to be engaged in child labour than those working 16 to 45hours (OR: 1; 95% CI: 0.3-1.5).

34

Children born to women without formal education, under non-hazardous jobs, irrespective of

35

the hours spent at work, were mostly exposed to child labour with following percentages:

36

52.9%, 56.8%, 62.4%, compared to children of mothers with some levels of education.

37

Finally, children that have experienced psychological aggression and physical punishment are

38

mostly exposed to child labour than those without such experience across the job types and

39

hours spent. Conclusion: This study revealed a significant influence of socio-demographic

40

and economic factors on the children labour and violence against children in Egypt. Poverty

41

neglects, lack of adequate care and exposures of children to various grades of violence are

42

major drivers of child labour across the country. North-eastern region of Egypt has a higher

43

likelihood of child labour than most other regions, while children who live in Delta are more

44

engaged in hazard work.

45

Keywords: Child labour, violence against Child, Risk factors, Geospatial effects.

Introduction

47

The General Assembly of the United Nations issued in 1989 (Resolution 44/25) a convention

48

for the rights of the children that defines a child as every human being below eighteen years

49

of age. This convention emphasized the need to seek to protect the child from performing any

50

work that could be hazardous, interfere with education, or damage his or her health or

51

physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development [1]. It also necessitated the Member

52

States to take legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to ensure such

53

protection. In addition, these states are obligated, according to this convention, to set a

54

minimum age for employment, determine an adequate system of working hours and working

55

conditions and impose appropriate penalties to ensure the effective application of these

56

conditions.

57

The International Labour Organisation (2004) reported in 2004 that in 1999–2000 overall

58

poverty in Egypt stood at 20.2%; with the poverty incidence appears to be highest in urban

59

Upper Egypt (36.33%), followed by rural Upper Egypt (34.68%), but it is lowest in the

60

Metropolitan region (9.01%). At least 12 million people could not fulfil their basic food and

61

non-food needs [2].

64

Recent statistics indicate that there are around 11 million children (under 15) in Egypt and of

65

these 11 million, around, 1.6 million work as child labour (ages 6 to 15) [3]. In 2014, the

66

World Food Program and the European Union reported that the number of employed minors

67

in Egypt jumped to at least 2.7 million. Most of them work six days a week, an average of 12

68

hours a day or more. They constitute an additional source of income for their families, who

69

depend on the income to provide for one-third of their expenditures. Approximately 78% are

70

employed in the countryside, and most of them are females. Between 1 and 1.5 million are

71

employed in agricultural labour. Of all working children, 84% live in rural areas while16% in

72

urban areas. Some recent statistics indicated that children who were engaged in child labour

73

have experienced punishment and abuse, largely physical or verbal.[3-4]

74

Egypt has agreed to the ratification of the present Treaty in addition to many international

75

treaties, which eliminate the criminalized economic exploitation of children, including the

76

international labour treaty No. 138 of 1973, which aimed (long-term) for the total elimination

77

of child labour. Also, Egypt has agreed with the international labour treaty No. 182 of 1999,

78

which came complimentary to the Treaty No. 138, which urges the elimination of the worst

79

forms of child labour initially, with the goal of eliminating child labour. All forms of child

80

labours are included by this agreement which also emphasizes the importance of free basic

81

child education [3]. Despite this, the distribution of the population by age indicates that a

82

relatively high percentage of the population is young: those below the age of 15 years

83

represent about 37.5 % of the total population. Out of this 37.5 %, 7 % of Egyptian children

84

were engaged in child labour in 2009 [2]. Egypt is the fourth highest country in child labour

85

according to the World Bank, 2015 [4]

86

The major contributing factors to child labour in Egypt are poverty, declining economic

87

conditions, and rising inflation which means that the situation is likely to worsen [3]. The

88

poverty index measures severe health deprivation by the proportion of people who are not

89

expected to survive to age 40. Based on this metric, the 2004 Human Development Report

90

(HDR) submitted that 3.1% (2.2 million people) of the total population of Egypt lives on less

91

than USD 1 per day [3]. Figure 1 shows the risk factors influencing household concerning

92

child labour as reported [5]

93

The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) reported that there are

94

12 million Egyptians who are homeless, of whom 1.5 million are living in cemeteries [6].

95

It has been reported also in the same source that the number of people living below the

96

poverty line in Egypt increased to 26.3 % of the population in 2013 compared to 25.2% in

97

2011 [6]. The report showed that the urban frontier governorates had the lowest poverty rate

98

with 11.4 %, while rural Upper Egypt governorates showed the highest poverty rate with

99

49.4 %. Also, it was found that among the illiterate, 37 % are poor while only 8 % of those

100

who finished universities were poor. The poor clearly exists in large households with more

101

than 10 members where 67 % of these households are poor [6].

102

The problem is that it is difficult to find accurate statistics on child workers or accurate

103

studies that have discussed this problem properly. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a

104

study that can describe this problem accurately and discuss the causes of it and provide some

105

suggestions that may help decision makers to handle this issue. In particular, the recent

106

political changes in Egypt may offer a chance to encourage the new government to deal with

107

this problem. Due to the negative effect of this phenomenon on the society, it is important to

108

precisely investigate this problem further and thoroughly using the results to shape the policy

109

and dedicated to improved outcomes for children [7].

110

Materials and Methods

111

The analysis in this work is based on the data obtained from the 2014 Egypt Demographic

112

and Health Survey (EDHS) (S1 Data) which is the most recent data on child labour in Egypt.

113

The 2014 EDHS data conducted by Egypt’s Ministry of Health and Population, the National

114

Population Council in collaboration with Macro International. (See Ministry of Health and

115

Population, El-Zanaty and Associates, and ICF International for detail information about

116

methods used in EDHS [8] [9]). As this was a secondary data analysis of open access data,

117

ethical approval was not required. The sample for the 2014 EDHS was designed to provide

118

estimates of population and health indicators, welfare indicators, and other indicators rates for

119

the country as a whole and for six major subdivisions (Urban Governorates, urban Lower

120

Egypt, rural Lower Egypt, urban Upper Egypt, rural Upper Egypt, and the Frontier

121

Governorates).[8]

122

The sample likewise allows for estimates of most key indicators at the governorate level.

123

In order to allow for separate estimates for the major geographic subdivisions and the

124

governorates, the number of households selected from each of the major sectors and each

125

governorate was disproportionate to the size of the population in the units.[8]

126

Thus, the dataset was weighted before proceeding with the analysis.

127

Study area and data

128

The 2014 EDHS on child labour allows for an assessment of several key aspects of the

129

welfare of Egypt’s children. Questions were included on birth registration and living

130

arrangements and the survival status of parents. Data also were collected on the prevalence of

131

injuries and accidents and disabilities among young children. A child’s access to education is

132

critical, and the EDHS obtained information on both the level of pre-school education among

133

young children and children’s participation in primary and secondary school.

134

The survey also looked at the extent of child labour and at the practices used in disciplining

135

children. In the 2014 EDHS, the first step in the administration of the Child Labour and Child

136

discipline modules involved the identification of a single child age 1-17 years for whom the

137

questions in the modules would be asked depending on the child’s age. If the household

138

included more than one child in the age range, the child for whom the modules were

139

administered was selected using a Kish grid1. If the selected child was 1-14 years, the Child

140

Discipline module was administered for the child. To account for the selection of one child

141

per household, the child discipline data are weighted. The weight is based on the de jure

142

population of children age 1-17 years [8].

143

Description of outcome variables

144

The 2014 EDHS considered the never-married children aged 5-17 years who are involved in

145

economic activities inside or outside the home according to the child’s age and a number of

146

hours worked. However, The MICS program has defined thresholds based on the child’s age

147

and the number of hours a child worked during the week to classify children’s involvement in

148

economic activities (MICS2014). This study, however, has used the ILO classifications

149

which are classified based on the number of hours worked per week into three groups as

150

follows: A) Less= 16rs a week; B) between 16 and less than 45hrs a week; and C) over 45hrs

151

a week.

152

The economic activities were classified into three groups, such as:

153

A) Non-Hazardous wage work. B) Hazardous wage work. C) Household work.

The Kish grid gives a procedure of selection. The expression “Kish grid” comes from the name of Leslie Kish, the
Hungarian born American statistician. Kish was one of the world’s leading experts on survey sampling.

154

Risk factors and covariates

155

We considered the following socio-demographic factors and the associated risk factors of the

156

child labour as explanatory variables: child’s age (5-17years), sex, household size, place of

157

residence, wealth index, mother education, father education, parental survivorship and violent

158

discipline approaches against children. The wealth index was used as proxies for the socio-

159

economic position of the household because EDHS does not collect information on

160

household income and expenditure. Egypt comprises 27 governorates, which were

161

categorised by EDHS into 7 areas namely: Urban governorates, Lower Egypt urban, Lower

162

Egypt rural, Upper Egypt urban, Upper Egypt rural and Frontier governorates. However, in

163

spatial analysis, we have used 27 governorates to investigate the spatial effects in the

164

prevalence of overlap economic activities of children at the state level. This was achieved

165

using a geo-additive semi-parametric multinomial model [9]. Figure 2 shows the multilevel

166

risk factors of child labour that applied to this study.

167

Statistical Methods

168

Let 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘 and 𝜋𝑖𝑗𝑘 represent the type of work and probability of working hours respectively.

169

Let working hours of at least 15hr diseases be (𝑘 = 1); working hours falling between 16 and

170

45hrs a week be (𝑘 = 2), and the working hours of over 45hrs a week be (𝑘 = 3).

171

𝑌𝑖𝑗~𝑀𝑁(𝑃𝑖𝑗, 𝑁𝑖𝑗)

172

We assume that 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘 is distributed as a multinomial distribution, such that: 𝑌𝑖𝑗~𝑀𝑁(1, 𝜋𝑖𝑗𝑘)

173

where 𝜋𝑖𝑗𝑘 = (𝜋𝑖𝑗1,𝜋𝑖𝑗2,𝜋𝑖𝑗3)′. Given some categorical covariates,𝑍𝑖𝑗, metrical covariates, 𝜐𝑖𝑘

174

and state-specific random effect, 𝑆𝑖𝑘, the probability can be modelled thus:

175

𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑘 =

𝜂𝑖𝑗𝑘

𝑆𝑘𝜂𝑖𝑗𝑘

=

exp (𝜂𝑖𝑗𝑘)
𝑘

∑exp (𝜂

; ∀ 𝑘 = 1,2,3

𝑖𝑗𝑘)

1

176

The predictor, 𝜂𝑖𝑗𝑘is given by 𝜂𝑖𝑗𝑘= 𝑧𝑖𝑗𝛽𝑘 + 𝑓𝑘(𝜐𝑖𝑗) + 𝑆𝑖𝑘where 𝜂𝑖𝑗𝑘 is a known response

177

function with a logit link function, 𝛽𝑘 is the vector of the regression parameters (explanatory

178

variables such as gender, place of residence, etc.) and𝑓𝑘 is a smooth function for the metrical

179

covariates (child's age) which were assumed to be nonlinear in some previous studies for

180

each of the status categories k [10] [11] [12] [13]. We have included these variables as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/546697; this version posted February 11, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

181

nonlinear metrical covariates in the early stage of this study; however, the pattern did not

182

show exactly the significance level of each category. Therefore, we used these covariates as

183

linear effects instead to assess the significance level of each category. We set the first

184

category as reference and used the logit link for the modelling.

185

The random effects, 𝑆𝑖𝑘are district or sub-district specific factors, which can be split into

186

spatially structured variation (𝜃𝑖𝑘) and unstructured multinomial heterogeneity (𝜙𝑖𝑘), such

187

that, 𝑆𝑖𝑘 = 𝜃𝑖𝑘 + 𝜙𝑖𝑘. P-spline priors were assigned to the functions; 𝑓1, 𝑓2,…𝑓𝑝whereas, a

188

Markov random field prior was used for f(𝑠𝑖)[14] [15].

189

To estimate model parameters, we applied the fully integrated Bayesian approach. Though

190

the estimation method with this model is difficult, the estimated posterior odds ratios (OR)

191

that were produced could be understood as similar to those of normal logistic models. The

192

analysis was carried out using version 2.1 of the BayesX software package, which certifies

193

Bayesian inference, based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques

194

[16] [17] [18].

195

Both the descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were carried out to examine the level of

196

associations between predictors, confounders, and outcome variables using version 14 of

197

STATA; with the p-values of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. The

198

multinomial logistic regression model was used to determine the degree of associations

199

between the outcome variables (a type of work indicators) and all the predictors. Posterior

200

Odds Ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI’s) were estimated.

201

Multiple imputations Analyses (Missing data)

202

This dataset has a significant proportion of missing data (S5 Table) although the missingness

203

is concentrated only in a few variables. At this stage, we will assess the monotone patterns

204

and the joint probability of missing across variables; thereafter which we will identify the

205

potential predictors of each variable that requires modelling ( [19], [20], [21], [22]).

206

One analytic option is to use only that dataset with complete observations, or we can replace

207

the missing values, through a process termed ‘imputation’. The simplest imputation replaces

208

the missing value with mean or median value for that variable; though, this is not a desirable

209

process, especially when one is examining the relationships between variables.

available under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

210

However, the more sophisticated method, termed ‘multiple imputations’, predicts missing

211

values for a variable using existing values from other variables. The predicted values, called

212

“imputes”, are substituted for the missing values, resulting in a full data set called an

213

“imputed data set” [23], [19]. This method imputes dataset using standard procedures for

214

complete data and combining the results from these analyses.

215

No matter which complete-data analysis is used, the process of combining results from

216

different data sets is essentially the same. In other words, we use the data from units where

217

both (𝑌, 𝑋) are observed to learn about the relationship between Y and X. Then, use this

218

relationship to complete the data set by drawing the missing observations from, 𝑋|𝑌. This

219

process is completed at if least N=5 times, giving rise to N complete data sets. Then each of

220

these imputed data sets is analysed and we combine the results using specific rules. It does

221

not attempt to estimate each missing value through simulated values but rather to represent a

222

random sample of the missing values [20], [23]. Multiple imputations inference involves

223

three distinct phases as follows:

224

1) Create imputed data sets which are plausible representations of the data.

225

2) Perform the chosen statistical analysis on each of these imputed data sets by using standard

226

procedures.

227

3) The results from the complete data sets are combined "average" for the inference to

228

produce one set of results.

229

Analyses based on Multiple imputed data will avoid bias only if enough variables that predict

230

the missing values are included in the imputation models. Therefore, including as many

231

predictors as possible tends to make the missing-at-random assumption more plausible [20].

232

However, including more than 25 predictors will increase the variance explained in the

233

prediction equations [24]

234

Multiple imputations are a more appropriate choice as a solution to missing data problems as

235

it represents a good balance between quality of results and ease of use. It has been shown to

236

perform favourably compare to other methods in a variety of missing data situations [25],

237

[26]. It can also produce unbiased parameter estimates which reflect the uncertainty

238

associated with estimating missing data. Furthermore, it has been shown to be robust to

239

departures from normality assumptions and provides adequate results in the presence of low

240

sample size or high rate of missing data.

241

The results of some previous studies using the most commonly used multiple imputation

242

methods, are Expectation Maximization (EM-algorithm) [14], [15] and the Monte Carlo

243

Markov chain (MCMC) [16] [27] method showed there was no significant difference

244

between EM algorithm and MCMC method for item imputation; and that the number of items

245

used for imputation has little impact, either [17].

246

However, in this study, we have applied MCMC method based on pseudo-random draws and

247

this will allow us to obtain several imputed data. It is known that MCMC can be used with

248

both arbitrary and monotone patterns of missing data. It is known as a collection of

249

techniques for simulating random draws from difficult probability distributions via Markov

250

chains. MCMC also is especially useful in Bayesian statistical analyses and for solving

251

difficult missing-data problems [14].

252

Assumptions about Missing Data

253

If EDHS data contain observations that were missing completely at random, the observations

254

would constitute a random sample of the complete dataset. Multiple imputations assume that

255

the observed variables are predictive of the missing values and that the data are missing at

256

random. Missing data are said to be missing at random (MAR) if the probability that data are

257

missing does not depend on unobserved data but may depend on observed data. MCAR can

258

be viewed as a particular case of MAR.

259

On the other hand, if the subjects are withdrawn from the study for ethical reasons, missing

260

would not be MAR. This type of missing-data mechanism is called missing not at random

261

(MNAR). For such missing data, the reasons for its missingness must be accounted for in the

262

model to obtain valid results. We looked at missing data patterns and also assessed the extent

263

of missing in the variables that were included in the analysis. Nonlinear relationships were

264

treated using semiparametric models (e.g. generalised additive models (GAMs) [28]. It was

265

important to include the outcome variable (in this case, economic activates) as a predictor in

266

the imputation model because failing to do so will dilute the associations between the

267

outcome and the other variables [18] [19].

287

The following factors were significantly associated with Non-hazardous wage work (see S3

288

Table): gender of a child (P=0.002); residence type, household size, place of residence and

289

wealth indices (P=0.001 each); violent discipline approach, especially: psychological

290

aggression (P=0.002) and physical punishment (P=0.08). However, the following factors:

291

parental education, parental survivor and severe punishment were not significant in this

292

category. For the hazardous wage work, the non-significant factors were household size,

293

Parental Survivorship, and Psychological aggression against children. Gender, the age of

294

children under 2, place of residence, wealth indicators, mothers' education, physical and

295

severe punishments (each with P=0.001). Father' education has a slight effect. For household

296

work, all the factors were highly significant (each with P=0.001).

297

Further, the percentage of male children exposed to child labour is largely higher than those

298

of female children, irrespective of the job type (Non-hazardous, hazardous and household-

299

based work) and the length of jobs, except for female children in a household job, and are

300

working at least 16 hours weekly have the higher percentage of 69.1% and 61.5%

301

respectively than the male children. Also, children from rural communities are more exposed

302

to child labour than their colleagues from urban cities with higher percentages across the

303

board of job type and hours spent at work.

304

Children living in the medium household and into non-hazardous jobs are apparently having

305

highest exposure rates (53.6%, 50.5% and 50.7%) compared to their mates in both small and

306

large households, irrespective of the hours spent at work. Children from Lower and Upper

307

Egypt were engaged in non-hazardous and household jobs and they have the highest

308

percentage across the three periods of a job than others from another region. However, for the

309

hazardous jobs, children from the Lower Egypt area seem to have the highest percentage of

310

exposure to child labour.

311

For the wealth indicators, children from the poorest homes were more exposed into non-

312

hazardous jobs with the following percentages (68.4, 53.8 and 44.4) for the three hours of at

313

least 16 hours, 16-45hrs and "above 45hrs" respectively than their colleagues at the remaining

314

wealth indices. The same with the poorest children working at least 45hrs in both hazardous

315

and household jobs have a higher percentage of exposure to child labour than their colleagues

316

from the remaining homes.

317

Children born to women without formal education, under non-hazardous jobs, irrespective of

318

the hours spent at work, are mostly exposed to child labour with following percentages:

319

52.7%, 56.8% 62.4%, compared to children of mothers with some levels of education. Also,

320

children whose both parents are alive seem to be most exposed to child labour under

321

household job condition than their mates without living parents.

322

Finally, children that have experienced psychological aggression and physical punishment are

323

mostly exposed to child labour than those without such experience across the job types and

324

hours spent. The same with those who have experienced severe physical punishment compare

325

to their counterparts who have not experienced severe physical punishment.

332

Residence's type, Household size, Place of Residence, Wealth index, parental education,

333

Parental Survivorship and Violent discipline approaches.

334

Columns 1&2 present the odds of children working "less than 16 hours" weekly as against

335

those working "between 16 and 45 hours" weekly, under Non-hazardous working condition.

336

For example, the results show that female children (with male children as reference category)

337

working less than 16hrs (OR: 1.3; with 95% CI: 1.2-1.5) are more likely to be impacted by

338

child labour than those working 16 to 45hours (OR: 1; 95% CI: 0.3-1.5). Also, for those

339

under household job, female children working between 16 and 45hours (with OR: 1.7; 95%

340

CI: 0.9-3.2) are more likely to be involved in child labour than those working at less than

341

16hrs weekly (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 0.7-2). Finally, under the hazardous working condition,

342

female children working 16-45hrs (OR: 1.6 and 95% CI of 1.4-2.7) are more at risk than

343

those working "less than 16hrs" weekly (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-1.5)

344

Similarly, Children aged 11-15 (OR: 0.5 and 95% CI: 0.4-0.8) are more likely to be at risk

345

than those aged over 15 years (OR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3-0.6) under the non-hazardous working

346

condition for "less than 16hrs" and for 16-45hrs of the weekly job. Although, the OR does not

347

seem significant in both age groups. Also, for children under household job, 11-15 of age

348

children are more likely to be at risk of child labour (OR: 2.3 and 95% CI: 0.9-5.6) compared

349

to those who are over 15 and are in 16-45hrs weekly job category. However, for the

350

hazardous job, children aged over 15 years who are working "less than 16hrs" (OR: 1.36;

351

95% CI: 0.3-3.2) are more at risk of child labour compared to their counterparts who are

352

under age of 15.

353

Rural children under 16-45hrs of the weekly job are more likely to be at risk than those

354

children working less than 16hrs a week under non-hazardous job. However, urban children

355

under non-hazardous and hazardous job more likely to be at risk compared to rural children,

356

regardless of the number of hours. However, rural children under household jobs are more

357

likely to be affected by child labour compared to urban children.

358

Children living under medium household who are working 16-45hrs weekly (with OR: 1.4;

359

95% CI: 1.3-1.6) have increased the risk of child labour in the non-hazardous job than those

360

of hazardous and household jobs. However, for those children in the large household, and

361

working less than16hrs a week under hazardous condition (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 0.5-2) may

362

likely to have a higher risk, compared to others at the two other working environments.

363

The poorer children working under the hazardous condition for "less than 16hrs" weekly

364

(OR: 1.93; 95%CI: 0.29-12.8) are likely to be most at risk compared to their colleagues

365

subjected to the two other working conditions. The same experience goes to the middle-class

366

children (OR: 2.3; 95%CI: 0.4-10.07). However, for the children from the richer and the

367

richest families, those under household job and are working "less than 16hrs" weekly, or 16-

368

45hrs are more likely to be at risk of child labour than other children who are in the other two

369

working conditions.

370

The half-orphans whose fathers are dead tending to be more exposed to the risks of child

371

labour, under non-hazardous and household-based job than those whose mothers are deceased,

372

irrespective of the hours of labour. However, for the children exposed to hazardous jobs,

373

those with deceased mothers are more likely to be at risk than those with deceased father.

374

Further, children who are exposed to psychological aggression and are working 16-45hrs

375

weekly (OR: 3.7; 95%CI: 1.5-9.5), under non-hazardous job, are more likely to be at risk of

376

child labour than their counterparts subjected to the two other working conditions. The same

377

with children subjected to severe physical punishment. However, the risk likelihood is

378

highest for children in household jobs, who are subjected to physical punishments, especially,

379

those working less than 16hrs weekly (OR: 9.3; 95%CI: 4.2-20.8).

380

Figure 3 shows the structured spatial effects of child labour. The results confirmed evidence

381

of regional differences in the likelihood of a child exposed to different type of works. From

382

the graph, it is clear the North-eastern region of Egypt has a higher likelihood of child labour

383

than most other regions. Using Frontier governorate as a reference, children residing in Upper

384

Egypt Rural have the highest risk of having all of three child labours. Hazard work is likely to

385

be in Delta (Suez) Canal, Ismailia, other neighbour cities); whilst, the lower and upper Egypt

386

are more affected by household work. Similarly, the likelihood of being exposed to Non-

387

hazard work is higher in lower and upper Egypt.

388

Discussion

389

This study emphasises the significance of seeking child protection against engaging in any

390

job or task that could be hazardous, interfere with education, or damage his or her health or

391

physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development in line with the UN convention. On

392

the note of which we find it imperative to investigate impacts of socio-demographic factors

393

and the associated risk factors on the child labour in Egypt. We reviewed how poverty,

394

declining economic conditions, and rising inflation continue to worsen the situation across

395

various parts in Egypt. To achieve the aim of this study, the UNESCO (2015)' statistics on

396

the distribution of children aged 5-14 years, of the school age who engages in child labour

397

across different sectors, are examined.

398

We then cross-classified the economic activities of the children aged 5-17, who are never-

399

married and are of the school age, based on the number of hours worked per week, subject to

400

ILO classifications against the socio-demographic and spatial factors to determine the level of

401

association between these factors and the nature of jobs these children are exposed to. We

402

went further to determine which of the socio-economic and spatial factors and the associated

403

risk factors are likely to expose these children to the risks inherent in the various labours they

404

are engaged.

405

From the results, we found that gender, age, household size, place of residence, regions,

406

violent discipline method, parental education and survivorships and wealth status of the

407

children are all predisposing factors of the children to the child labour at different working

408

conditions. Specifically, we found that the percentage of male children in non-hazardous

409

jobs; working longer hours are more than female children. However, more than 61% of

410

female children engaging in household jobs spend 16-45hours at work, compared to their

411

male counterparts with about 39% in household jobs. Likewise, female children spend more

412

hours weekly (over 45hrs) in household jobs compared to male children.

413

Percentage of children living in a medium household and working over 16hrs a week is

414

higher compared to those both in the small and large household. Children living in Upper

415

and Lower part of Egypt, those from the poorest home, those born by women without formal

416

education and those that have experienced both psychological and physical punishments have

417

higher percentage compared to their mates within the respective categories.

418

Further, we found that children aged 11-15 are more at risk of exposure to child labour than

419

those aged over 15 years. The same goes to the rural children, who have higher chances of

420

exposure than their colleagues from urban cities. Children from the poorer homes, those

421

whose fathers are dead and those subjected to psychological aggression and physical

422

punishment are more likely to be lured into child labour.

423

Apparently from on our findings so far, one could argue that there is evidence of child labour

424

in Egypt and that socio-demographic and spatial factors greatly predispose majority of the

425

children to it.

426
427

Conclusion

428

We have presented Bayesian geospatial modelling with multiple imputation models for child

429

labour and violence against child issues in Egypt. These types of epidemiological studies are

430

relatively rare. Most of the previous studies were limited to exploratory analysis of child

431

health only [29], [24] [25].

432

We have established evidence of the presence of child labour and the impacts of socio-

433

demographic and their associated risk factors on the child labour across Egypt

434

This study is novel because the association between geospatial factors, socio-demographic

435

factors, and child labour has not been investigated before in Egypt. The findings reveal a

436

significant influence of socio-demographic and economic factors on the child labour and

437

violence against children in Egypt. Significant of these findings is that poverty, neglects, lack

438

of adequate care and exposures of children to various grades of violence are major drivers of

439

child labour across the country. North-eastern region of Egypt has a higher likelihood of child

440

labour than most other regions, while children who live in Delta are more engaged in hazard

441

work. Government is therefore encouraged by the outcomes of this study to work towards

442

protecting the rights of children as enshrined in the United Nations convention and to educate

443

and empower children from the less-privileged families

444

Strength and Limitations of this Study

445

As much as we know, this is the first time study of this kind would be undertaken in Egypt on

446

geospatial factors impacting negatively on child labour. Also, it is the first study to our

447

knowledge which implements such advanced modelling whilst imputing the missing values

448

that usually affect the data of the child labour in developing countries. The study is done in

449

line with the 2014 EDHS, which promotes the assessment of several key aspects of the

450

welfare of Egypt’s children. However, the level of missing observations in the data is a major

451

challenge in this study.
