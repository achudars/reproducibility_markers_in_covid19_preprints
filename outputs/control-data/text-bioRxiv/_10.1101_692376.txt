ABSTRACT: Forest insects and pathogens (FIPs) have significant impacts on U.S. forests, each

14

year affecting an area nearly three times the area of wildfires and timber harvesting combined.

15

We surveyed family forest owners (FFOs) in the northeastern U.S. and 84% of respondents

16

indicated they would harvest in at least one of the presented FIP infestation scenarios. This

17

harvest response represents a potentially significant shift in the timing, extent, and species

18

selection of harvesting in the Northeast. Here we used the landowner survey, regional forest

19

inventory data, and characteristics of the emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis) invasion

20

to examine the potential for a rapidly spreading FIP to alter harvest regimes and affect regional

21

forest conditions. Twenty-five percent of the FFO parcels in the Connecticut River Watershed in

22

New England are likely to be harvested in response to EAB within 10 years. This prediction

23

represents an increase in harvest frequencies, from 2.9%/yr (historically) to 3.7%/yr, on FFO

INTRODUCTION

29

Forest insects and pathogens (FIPs) have significant impacts on U.S. forests, each year affecting

30

an area nearly three times the area of all wildfires and timber harvesting combined (Hicke et al.

31

2012, Williams et al. 2016). FIPs selectively reduce tree species abundances, thereby altering

32

forest structure and composition, disrupting carbon, water, and nutrient cycles (Hicke et al.

33

2012), and undermining ecosystem service provisioning, including timber production, carbon

34

storage, and wildlife habitat creation (Boyd et al. 2013). FIPs also have significant indirect

35

impacts on forests by altering management practices, often initiating pre-emptive and salvage

36

harvesting (Lindenmayer et al. 2008). In 2017, our interdisciplinary team surveyed family forest

37

owners (FFOs) in the Northeastern, U.S.; approximately 84% of respondents indicated that they

38

would harvest their trees in at least one of the four presented FIP infestation scenarios

39

(Markowski-Lindsay et al. 2019). This harvest response to FIPs represents a potentially

40

significant shift in the timing, extent, and species selection of harvesting in the Northeast.

41

Timber harvesting is the primary driver of forest disturbance in the northeast (Brown et al.

42

2018); therefore, this shift in the harvest regime would change regional patterns of disturbance

43

with potentially profound impacts. Here we use the survey and regional forest inventory data to

44

examine the potential for an emerging and rapidly spreading FIP, the emerald ash borer (Agrilus

45

planipennis), to alter harvest regimes and affect regional forest conditions.

46

Salvage harvesting in response to natural disturbances, like FIPs, is commonly practiced to

47

recover some of the value in their timber before it deteriorates (Lindenmayer et al. 2008). Like

48

all harvests, salvage harvests can alter forest development trajectories and change structural

49

legacies with lasting impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services (Leverkus et al. 2018).

50

Salvage harvests usually occur after the disturbance, but occasionally, and particularly in the

51

case of FIPs, occur preemptively in an attempt to mitigate future damage or value loss, or slow

52

FIP spread (Waring and O’Hara 2005). Here we use the term “FIP harvest” to refer to any

53

harvest that was initiated either in anticipation of or in response to damage from a FIP. One

54

concern with FIP harvesting in mixed hardwood forests, like those in the Northeast, is the

55

phenomenon of harvest “by-catch”, or the non-host tree species harvested with the FIP-host

56

species to enhance the commercial viability of the harvest or achieve another silvicultural

57

objective (e.g. regeneration of a desirable mix of species). Irland et al. (1988) reported

58

landowners harvesting to mitigate damages from spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana)

59

outbreaks in Maine, and those harvests included tree species beyond the budworm’s primary

60

regional hosts. Similarly, Kizlinski et al. (2002) found that in harvests following hemlock woolly

61

adelgid (Adelges tsugae) outbreaks in Connecticut and Massachusetts, species other than

62

hemlock were removed in a majority of the harvests.

63

Northeastern forests are a carbon sink and are expected to remain so into the next century

64

(Duveneck and Thompson 2019). However, the Northeast also has the largest abundance of

65

exotic FIPs in North America and their numbers and impacts are predicted to increase with

66

climate change and unchanged U.S. global trade policies (Lovett et al. 2016). The impacts of

67

FIPs and FIP harvesting in the mixed forests of the Northeast threaten the status of these forests

68

as a carbon sink and are increasingly important to understand, despite the inherent challenge of

69

predicting landowner response to FIPs. In New England, FFOs control 54% percent of forested

70

land (Butler et al. 2016), each with individual forest management and ownership objectives.

71

Kittredge and Thompson (2016) found that the timing of harvests does not follow timber market

72

trends, so most harvests on these woodlands are likely initiated by an exogenous force, such as a

73

family event, change in income, or forest management plan. The results from our survey of

74

landowners (Markowski-Lindsay et al. 2019), suggest that FIPs may serve as an important

75

exogenous force for initiating harvesting in these woodlands, resulting in a regional disturbance

76

regime that may be distinct from either the FIPs or typical harvesting alone.

77

The survey used a contingent behavior experiment to understand whether FFOs with parcels

78

>4.05 ha (10 ac) in the Connecticut River Watershed (CTRW) of New England might harvest in

79

response to a FIP (Markowski-Lindsay et al. 2019). Respondents were given four scenarios of

80

FIP arrival and tree mortality and responded whether they would harvest in each scenario and

81

provided a measure of certainty in their answer. The respondents of the survey fell into three

82

categories: (1) Cutters (46% of respondents) – those that responded they would harvest for all

83

four FIP scenarios; (2) Responsive Cutters (42%) – those that responded they would harvest in

84

some of the scenarios presented; and (3) Non-cutters (12%) – those that would not harvest in any

85

of the scenarios presented (Holt et al. 2019). Holt et al. (2019) then developed and defined agent

86

functional types (AFTs) to characterize the different landowner responses to the presence of a

87

generic FIP using the responses to the survey. Here we apply our knowledge of FFO response to

88

FIPs and the developed AFTs to the specific case of emerald ash borer (EAB) to determine the

89

potential direct and indirect impacts on the mixed forests of the CTRW.

90

EAB is a wood boring insect introduced from Asia that attacks North American ash (Fraxinus

91

spp.). Since its identification in Michigan in 2002 (Herms and McCullough 2014), EAB has

92

become the costliest exotic insect in the U.S. (Aukema et al. 2011). EAB typically kills ash trees

93

in four to 10 years after infestation and has caused 99% mortality of ash trees > 2.5 cm in

94

diameter in areas surrounding the initial introduction of EAB in Michigan (Klooster et al. 2018).

95

EAB was first observed in New England in 2012 and the leading edge of the infestation is

96

spreading at an average rate of 57 km/yr (Evans 2016), suggesting that EAB will be present

97

throughout the region within the next decade (Herms and McCullough 2014).

98

Indeed, EAB has the potential to cause regional elimination of ecologically, economically, and

99

aesthetically important hardwood species (Herms and McCullough 2014, Klooster et al. 2018).

100

Information from loggers, foresters, and state agencies indicate that EAB is already prompting

101

harvests and ash thinning (e.g., Mercader et al. 2015, Sadof et al. 2017). Ash often exists in

102

relatively low abundance on forest woodlands (averaging 5.5% in New England, though patchy

103

based on local conditions) (Bechtold and Patterson 2005). Therefore, given the volume of a

104

typical harvest in the region and varied objectives of harvests, harvests initiated by the presence

105

of EAB are likely to remove more than the affected ash. Here we seek to: (1) apply the results of

106

a contingent behavior experiment to estimate a range of harvest responses to EAB based on the

107

distribution of owner types and EAB invasion characteristics; and (2) quantify the resulting

108

impact on regional forest biomass and composition.

109

METHODS

110

Study area and spatial data

111

We conducted our study in the Connecticut River Watershed (CTRW), a 3-million ha watershed

112

within New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut (Figure 1). There are over

113

90,000 FFOs in the CTRW. We compiled ownership parcel boundaries for the CTRW from:

114

state-level GIS sources, county and/or town websites, and tax maps. Where parcel maps were

115

unavailable, we imputed parcel boundaries from neighboring towns with similar demographic

116

and spatial distributions (approx. 12% of the landscape). A map of tree species aboveground

117

biomass (AGB) was estimated following the methods in Duveneck et al. (2015) to associate each

118

pixel with Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA, Bechtold and Patterson 2005) plots with similar

119

spectral and environmental characteristics. We used this forest map to estimate the impacts of

120

FIPs and subsequent harvest, as well as determine which tree species co-occur with ash and

121

therefore may be most affected by the harvest response to EAB (Appendix A). For this study,

122

we only used the distributions of white ash (Fraxinus americana) and black ash (Fraxinus

123

nigra), and while these are the two most abundant ash species in the CTRW, white ash makes up

124

99.96% of the total ash biomass (Table 1).

125

Determining harvest response to EAB

126

In this region, a majority of FFO harvests are low intensity (e.g. non-commercial) harvests, but

127

are ecologically important drivers of forest change (Thompson et al. 2017, Belair and Ducey

128

2018). Therefore, for modeling the harvest response to EAB, we assumed the range of possible

129

harvest responses included commercial and non-commercial harvests. We also assumed that

130

EAB was present throughout the study area (at its current rate of spread, this assumption will

131

likely be met within one decade). Following Holt et al. (2019), each parcel with ash was assigned

132

an AFT and a probability of harvest based on the presence of EAB (Figure 2, and Appendix B

133

for details). For the Cutter and Non-cutter AFTs, harvest probabilities were assigned using the

134

certainty distributions of the survey responses from the respondents in these AFTs (e.g., 1 =

135

Cutter with high certainty; 0 = Non-cutter with high certainty), where the certainty distributions

136

were derived from a 5-step Likert scale certainty question that followed each scenario in the

137

survey (Appendix B). The probability of harvest for Responsive Cutters was based on what Holt

138

et al. (2019) found to be significant in predicting harvest for this group: 1) the percentage of their

139

trees killed by the FIP; and 2) the time it takes for those trees to die (Figure 2). A higher

140

mortality percentage and more rapid tree death both increased the likelihood a Responsive Cutter

141

would harvest. For this EAB application, the relative abundance of ash on the parcel was used as

142

the mortality percent and we made the conservative assumption of 8 years to mortality from

143

initial infestation for those ash trees. The probabilities of harvest were then stochastically used

144

to predict which parcel owners might harvest in response to EAB. The process of assigning

145

AFTs, probabilities of harvest, and finally harvest locations, was replicated 10 times to capture

146

the variability in assigning harvest locations.

147

Quantifying cumulative impacts of EAB

148

We used the forest composition map and the 10 simulated harvest maps to estimate species AGB

149

removal in EAB-initiated FFO harvests. To account for the uncertainty regarding the specific

150

silvicultural choices made by foresters and loggers, we examined three alternative harvest

151

scenarios and report the total AGB and species-specific AGB that could be harvested in response

152

to EAB. Our estimates include the AGB of merchantable timber trees (i.e., larger than 23 cm (9

153

in) diameter at breast height (dbh) for softwoods and 28 cm (11 in) dbh for hardwoods) and only

154

parcels that met the criteria for our survey (i.e., FFO parcels > 4.05 ha). We also set a minimum

155

forest area size of 3.15 ha on mixed land use parcels to ensure enough forest for measurable tree

156

removal. We included three harvest scenarios, described below.

157

Scenario A: Typical harvest intensities and no species preferences

158

Scenario A assumed that the presence of a FIP is an exogenous force that initiates a typical FFO

159

harvest, rather than a reactionary salvage harvest. As some state agencies and interest groups

160

recommend removing healthy ash just prior to infestation (e.g., see NHBugs.org), some

161

landowners are choosing to pre-emptively harvest ash, which may indeed result in a more

162

planned and typical harvest than a reactionary harvest after infestation. Furthermore, the

163

harvests in this scenario did not differentially affect tree species based on their type or value;

164

rather, the proportion of AGB removed, or harvest intensity, was applied equally to all species

165

with trees of merchantable timber size on the parcel. To determine what constitutes a “typical

166

harvest” intensity for FFO harvests in the CTRW, we used the harvest intensity distributions

167

from re-measured FIA plots on FFO lands in the CTRW states that experienced tree removal

168

between measurements. We included all types of removals, from very low intensity removals to

169

clear-cuts, to define these distributions (Appendix B). Harvest intensities for individual parcels

170

were then drawn from these distributions. All merchantable ash was first removed, then any

171

remaining timber was removed proportionally from all remaining species until the target harvest

172

intensity was met. Where the total volume of ash on a parcel exceeded the necessary volume for

173

the target harvest intensity, all merchantable ash was removed, but no more.

174

Scenario B: Typical harvest intensities and species preferences

175

Scenario B differentially harvests tree species based on patterns observed in the historical data.

176

In this scenario, the harvest intensities were the same as in Scenario A, but the amount removed

177

for each species (other than ash) was weighted to match the observed harvest distributions from

178

the re-measured FIA plots. Weights were calculated by dividing the proportion of each species

179

removed from the initial measurement to the re-measurement of a plot by the overall harvest

180

intensity for that plot and then averaged over all harvested plots (Appendix C).

181

Scenario C: Decreased harvest intensity and increased species preference

182

In Scenario C, we examined the possibility that harvest prompted by EAB will be less intense

183

than typical harvests, supposing that many of the harvests were reactionary and not planned with

184

harvest volumes as an objective. Therefore, the harvest intensities for each parcel were reduced

185

by 50%. In addition, the weighting of species removal was intensified to approximate a behavior

186

where preferable trees are selectively chosen in a low-intensity FIP harvest so the landowner can

187

recover the operational cost of harvesting while removing the fewest number of trees beyond the

188

affected ash. To reweight the species, weights of preferential trees (weight > 1) were increased

189

by 10% and the weights of non-preferential trees (weight < 1) were decreased by 10%.

190

RESULTS

191

Determining harvest response to EAB

192

In total, 80,010 FFO parcels met the area requirements for harvest consideration, and of these

193

parcels, 40,419 contained merchantable ash timber. On average, 42%±0.2% (mean±sd) of the

194

parcels with ash were assigned to the Cutter landowner type class; 44%±0.1% were Responsive

195

Cutters, and; 14%±0.1% were Non-cutters. The average probability of harvest for Cutters was

196

0.89±0.003, 0.22±0.004 for Responsive Cutters, and 0.12±0.004 for Non-cutters (Figure 2). On

197

average, 25%±0.07% (19,705±55 parcels) of the FFO parcels that met the area requirements for

198

harvesting (with or without ash) were harvested, equating to 37%±0.7% of the forested area of

199

all FFO parcels in the watershed. Approximately 77%±0.3% of the harvests occur on Cutter type

200

class parcels, 19%±0.3% on Responsive Cutter parcels, and 4%±0.1% on Non-cutter parcels

201

(Figure 1). Harvest intensities also vary by location within the CTRW (Appendix B). The

202

average harvest intensity applied to harvest parcels in the northern region was 45%±28%, and

203

the average harvest intensity applied to the southern region was 27%±22%.

204

Quantifying cumulative impacts of EAB

205

We found 8.2 Tg of merchantable timber size ash biomass on harvestable FFO parcels in the

206

CTRW; up to 99% of which is expected to be killed by EAB (Klooster et al. 2018).

9

aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

207

Approximately 54% (4.4 Tg) of that ash is expected to be removed from the landscape through

208

harvest in all scenarios (Table 1). In Scenario A, 18.8 Tg of AGB was harvested from co-

209

occurring species (or as by-catch) in addition to the ash (Table 1). Including the ash removal, the

210

total AGB harvested in response to EAB equates to 13% of all AGB in the harvestable FFO

211

parcels in the CTRW (with or without ash). In Scenario B, a similar amount of biomass was

212

removed as in Scenario A; however, the amount of each species removed differed. In this

213

scenario, yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), paper birch (B. papyrifera), and black cherry

214

(Prunus serotina) incur the largest potential losses, up to 17% of their AGB, due to preferential

215

harvesting and co-occurrence with ash (Table 1 and Appendix A). In Scenario C, with decreased

216

harvest intensity only 9.0 Tg of biomass was harvested from co-occurring species. However, a

217

few species, such as yellow birch, were removed at higher than average proportions.

218

DISCUSSION

219

We used forest owner survey data and a landowner typology to examine three scenarios

220

describing the harvest response to EAB; they suggest that harvest frequency could increase 28%

221

above the recent trends in harvesting (sensu Thompson et al. 2017). Twenty-five percent of

222

parcels, representing 37% of the FFO forested area, within the CTRW were predicted to be

223

harvested in response to EAB. Given the spread rate of EAB and its current locations within the

224

watershed, most of this harvest is predicted to take place in the next decade. Assuming this

225

future, the annual probability of harvest in response to EAB could be 3.7% for FFO lands in the

226

CTRW for the next 10 years. Thompson et al. (2017) found that in the 20-state northeastern

227

region of the FIA, the annual probability of harvest on non-corporate private woodlands was

228

2.9%. Therefore, the harvest induced by EAB likely represents an acceleration and potential

229

expansion of harvest into parcels not usually harvested in this region.

230

At typical harvest intensities (e.g., scenarios A and B), 13% of the total AGB in forests in the

231

CTRW could be harvested by FFOs in response to the invasion of EAB. In scenarios A and B,

232

81% of the removed AGB was from species other than ash (Fraxinus spp.). Therefore, the FIP

233

harvest response in these scenarios created a disturbance, in terms of total AGB affected, more

234

than twice the magnitude of the expected disturbance of EAB and included a larger number of

235

species. In scenario C, where harvest intensities are lower, 65% of the removed biomass was

236

from species other than ash, creating a disturbance 1.5 times the magnitude of EAB alone. Both

237

co-occurrence with ash and silvicultural prescription influenced the scope of the disturbance for

238

individual species. For example, 81% of yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis) is co-located with ash.

239

Since yellow birch is also a preferred species for harvest, 17% of the merchantable timber-size

240

yellow birch trees were harvested in the typical harvest intensities and species preference

241

scenario (B). If average harvest intensities are lower for the FIP harvests but target preferential

242

species (e.g., Scenario C), the cumulative impacts of EAB is less but preferred merchantable

243

species that co-occur with ash (e.g. yellow birch) are removed proportionally more than species

244

of less value or that do not co-occur with ash as frequently (e.g. black birch, B. lenta).

245

In all scenarios, more frequent harvests have far-reaching ecological impacts. Harvesting in

246

response to a FIP with a specific host(s) alters the species composition of the landscape by

247

differentially impacting species that co-occur with the host. The by-catch in FIP harvesting will

248

be especially prevalent in the mixed forests of the Northeast when harvests are planned with

249

timber volumes and/or larger regeneration openings as objectives, since, one host species often

250

will not be enough to meet target volumes or silvicultural objectives.

252

The survey we used to develop and apply the landowner typology did not ask questions about the

253

type or intensity of harvesting that a FIP might induce. To account for this uncertainty, we

254

presented three scenarios of varying harvest intensity and species removal. Further investigation

255

into the intensity and types of silvicultural prescriptions applied in the harvest response to EAB

256

is necessary to quantify these effects, particularly from the viewpoint of the foresters and loggers

257

who are completing the harvests. Additionally, it is unknown if the harvest response may be

limited by the capacity of foresters, loggers, and markets. We also expect that there is some

259

interplay between harvest unrelated to EAB, FIP harvest in response to EAB, forest growth

260

dynamics, and climate change. To assess specifically how FIP harvests may accelerate and

261

intensify forest disturbance and change forest growth and composition over time, future research

262

should explore these dynamics with a spatially and temporally explicit representation of

263

background harvest and FIP harvest initiated by EAB.

264

In addition, there are several other FIPs currently impacting forests in the region (e.g., hemlock

265

woolly adelgid, European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), beech bark disease), and Leung et al.

266

(2014) predict a tripling of non-native wood-borers in the northeast by 2050, with at least one

267

new wood-borer having the same or larger impact on the landscape as EAB. The interactions

268

among FIPs will have extensive ecological impacts on the forested landscape, but as shown in

269

this study, the coupled human management response may intensify and expand the total

270

disturbance created by these FIPs. The individual ecological impacts of these FIPs on current

271

forest structure and future forest dynamics is somewhat understood, however the management

272

responses to multiple interacting global change drivers is less well-resolved. Our study

273

underscores the importance of better understanding these complex interactions to predict the fate

274

of our forests and their ability to continue to provide essential ecosystem services.

Appendix B: Process for assigning a harvest to each parcel
Following the methods from Holt et al. (2019), landowners were first categorized into two
groups based on size and location of the parcel into a large parcel size + New Hampshire group
and a small parcel size group (Figure 2). Then using a multinomial regression, landowners were
assigned to one of the three AFTs: Non-cutter, Responsive Cutter, or Cutter. Moving beyond the
AFT assignment from Holt et al. (2019), parcels were then given a probability of harvest unique
to this example using EAB. Parcels in the Cutter or the Non-cutter AFTs were initially given 1
or 0 probability of harvest (respectively) and then those probabilities were augmented using the
distribution of certainty of harvest from the survey responses of those groups (Figure B1). For
example, a Cutter respondent that consistently ranked their responses as “Very Certain” would
have a certainty of harvest of 1, while another Cutter respondent with lower certainty in their
responses would have a certainty of harvest closer to 0.5. Likewise, a Non-cutter respondent that
consistently ranked their responses as “Very Certain” would have a certainty of harvest of 0,
while another Non-cutter respondent with lower certainty in their responses would have a
certainty of harvest closer to 0.5. Cutter parcels were assigned individual harvest probabilities
using a stochastic application of the Cutter certainty distribution and Non-cutter parcels were
assigned individual harvest probabilities using 1-the Non-cutter certainty distribution. Holt et al.
(2019) found that the probability of harvest for Responsive Cutters was based on the percentage
of trees dying from the FIP on their land and the years to mortality for those trees, in which a
higher mortality percentage and quicker time to death both increased the likelihood of harvest
(Figure 2). For this specific application using EAB, the mortality percent was the relative
abundance of ash for each parcel and we chose a conservative time to death of 8 years for ash at
the time of initial infestation. The distribution of harvest probabilities was unique for each

landowner type class (Figure B2). The probability of harvest was then used to stochastically
assign harvest or no harvest to each parcel (Figure 1).
Subsequently, to mimic typical harvest intensities across the landscape, we assigned a harvest
intensity (AGB removed/AGB prior to harvest) to each harvest parcel. We used remeasured FIA
plots from the CTRW states to determine typical levels of harvest. An exploration of the harvest
intensities in different regions and states where the CTRW resides revealed that the harvest
intensities were different between Northern Vermont and Northern New Hampshire (as defined
in the FIA state data) and the rest of the CTRW. The average harvest intensity of the northern
region (N) was 46% of total AGB removed per harvest (n = 91), and the southern region (S) had
an average harvest intensity of 27% (n = 120). The distributions of the harvest intensities
captured by the FIA were also different. Therefore, multiple distributions to model the harvest
intensity were tested (e.g. gamma, Weibull, lognormal, Cauchy, exponential), and the best fit
was determined using the Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike 1973) for each region
independently. For the northern region, a Weibull distribution (shape = 1.49, scale = 0.512) was
the best fit for harvest intensities observed in the FIA (AIC = 26.82, ΔAIC = 2.16). For the
southern region, a lognormal distribution (mean = -1.61, sd = 0.831) was the best fit for the
distribution of harvests in that region (AIC = -86.70, ΔAIC = 1.66) (Figure B3). The process
from AFT assignment to harvest map with harvest intensities was completed 10 times to create
replicates for assessing the variability introduced in the process of determining harvest parcels
and intensities.

Appendix C: Weighting of species based on FIA species weights.
Weights were based on species removals from individual FIA plots in the states of the CTRW.
Weights were calculated by dividing the proportion of each species removed from the initial
measurement to the re-measurement of each FIA plot by the harvest intensity of that plot. These
proportions were then averaged over all harvested plots. Species removed in higher proportions
than the average received a weight > 1, while species removed in lower proportions received a
weight < 1. For example, if sugar maple (Acer saccharum) existed on a harvested plot, less of it
was harvested than yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis).
