Abstract:

Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute, Wollongong, New South Wales, 2522,

10

In the model organism Escherichia coli, helix distorting lesions are recognized by the UvrAB damage

11

surveillance complex in the global genomic nucleotide excision repair pathway (GGR). Alternately,

12

during transcription-coupled repair (TCR), UvrA is recruited to Mfd at sites of RNA polymerases

13

stalled or paused by lesions. Ultimately, damage recognition is mediated by UvrA, culminating in

14

the loading of the damage verification enzyme UvrB. We set out to characterize the differences in

15

the kinetics of interactions of UvrA with Mfd and UvrB. We followed functional, fluorescently tagged

16

UvrA molecules in live cells and measured their residence times in TCR-deficient or wild-type cells.

17

We demonstrate that the lifetimes of UvrA in Mfd-dependent or Mfd-independent interactions in

18

the absence of exogenous DNA damage are comparable in live cells, and are governed by UvrB.

19

Upon UV irradiation, we found that the lifetimes of UvrA strongly depended on, and matched those

20

of Mfd. Here, we illustrate a non-perturbative, imaging-based approach to quantify the kinetic

21

signatures of damage recognition enzymes participating in multiple pathways in cells.

Introduction

25

Across the various domains of life, the recognition and repair of bulky, helix-distorting lesions in

26

chromosomal DNA is coordinated by nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors. Damage detection

27

occurs in two stages: a dedicated set of damage surveillance enzymes (reviewed in ref.1, 2, 3) (namely

28

the prokaryotic UvrA, and the eukaryotic UV-DDB, XPC, XPA and homologs) constantly survey genomic

29

DNA for lesions. At sites of putative DNA damage, these enzymes load specific factors (UvrB in

30

prokaryotes, TFIIH and homologs in eukaryotes) that unwind the DNA and verify the location of the

31

damage with nucleotide resolution (Fig. 1a) (reviewed in ref.2, 3). Subsequently, specialized

32

endonucleases (prokaryotic UvrC and homologs, and the eukaryotic XPF-ERCC1/XPG and homologs)

33

are recruited to the site of the DNA, resulting in cleavage of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) patch

34

containing the lesion (reviewed in ref.2, 3).

35

In several studied organisms (barring certain archaea4, 5), removal of DNA damage also occurs via the

36

triggering of strand-specific DNA repair following the stalling of RNA polymerase (RNAP) at sites of

37

lesions (reviewed in ref.6). In this case, a ternary elongation complex (TEC) of RNAP that is unable to

38

catalyse nascent RNA synthesis manifests as an ultra-stable protein-DNA roadblock. Transcription-

39

repair coupling factors such as the prokaryotic Mfd, and the eukaryotic homologs Rad26/CSB are

40

dedicated factors that recognize these TECs and remodel them7, 8, 9, 10, 11. In prokaryotes, Mfd is

41

recruited to the site of a failed TEC, and in turn it recruits the UvrA2B complex via interactions between

42

its UvrB-homology module (BHM) and UvrA. (Fig. 1) 9, 11, 12, 13. Similarly, in eukaryotes, CSB is recruited

43

to the site of a stalled RNAPII complex, and recruits the TFIIH complex14.

44

DNA repair triggered by stalling of TECs is termed transcription-coupled repair (TCR), in contrast to the

45

direct detection of lesions by the UvrAB damage sensor (global genomic repair, or GGR). Studies

46

investigating the rate of repair during TCR vs. GGR, have reported an enhancement in the rate of

47

removal of UV-induced lesions from the template strand in transcribed DNA compared to non-

48

transcribed DNA15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. This observation has sparked several studies targeted at understanding

49

the mechanistic basis of rate enhancement13, 21, 22. A recent single-molecule in vitro study reported

50

that the time to incision in TCR is approximately three-fold faster than in GGR under certain conditions

51

13

52

A diverse set of intermediates is readily formed in vitro - ranging from a translocating RNAP-Mfd

53

complex, arrested RNAP-Mfd-UvrA2 and the complete Mfd-UvrA2-UvrB handoff complex in the

54

presence of both UvrA and UvrB12, 13. To understand which of these intermediates are formed inside

55

cells, we have recently visualized Mfd in cells and quantified its lifetime in the TCR reaction12. A recent

56

study failed to detect an influence of Mfd on the behaviour of fluorescently tagged UvrA in living

57

cells23. Therefore, in vitro studies notwithstanding, how TCR is orchestrated by UvrA in cells remains

58

unclear.

59

In this work, we revisited this question in the context of live cells and applied high-resolution single-

60

molecule imaging methods that permit accurate measurements of DNA binding lifetimes over a broad

61

timescale ranging from a few hundred milliseconds to several minutes12, 24. We asked the question:

62

what is the lifetime of interactions of UvrA with Mfd and UvrB? To answer this question, we visualized

63

fluorescently tagged UvrA in cells and measured the lifetimes of the interactions with DNA in wild-

64

type and TCR-deficient cells. We find that UvrA is long lived on DNA in the absence of UvrB and Mfd,

65

and that its dissociation is promoted by UvrB in cells. The cellular concentration of UvrA relative to

66

UvrB strongly influences its binding lifetime in interactions with DNA-bound Mfd. The binding lifetimes

67

of Mfd-UvrA interactions are only detected under conditions of limiting UvrB in the absence of

68

exogenous DNA damage, suggesting a role for UvrB in resolving Mfd-UvrA intermediates. Exposure to

69

ultraviolet light (UV) leads to an increase in the binding lifetime of UvrA in TCR-deficient cells. In

70

contrast, in TCR-proficient cells, the DNA-bound lifetimes of UvrA and Mfd are identical, and drop

71

upon UV exposure suggesting the formation of an Mfd-UvrA intermediate in TCR. Together, these

72

studies characterize the interaction of UvrA with Mfd in live cells. Here, we establish a comprehensive

73

framework for characterizing the binding kinetics of DNA repair proteins participating in multiple

74

parallel pathways in vivo using non-perturbative, single-molecule imaging approaches.

75

RESULTS

76

The nucleotide excision repair reaction can be considered to occur in five discrete stages: damage

77

recognition, damage verification, incision, repair synthesis and ligation (reviewed in ref2). UvrA

78

mediates damage recognition by itself and by interacting with Mfd1. It does so by surveying the

79

genome constantly for the presence of DNA damage or for Mfd-bound TECs. Following DNA binding

80

at a putative damage site, damage verification is then orchestrated by the damage verification enzyme

81

UvrB25. Surprisingly, UvrA by itself has relatively poor specificity for binding to DNA damage over

82

undamaged DNA26. Here, we set out to characterize the kinetic states that describe damage

83

surveillance and loading of UvrB in live cells.

84

Imaging of UvrA-YPet in the absence of exogenous DNA damage

85

To visualize the binding of UvrA to DNA in cells, we replaced the uvrA gene with a C-terminal fusion of

86

uvrA to the gene for the yellow fluorescent protein (YPet27) in MG1655 cells using l Red recombination

87

(Fig. 2a)12, 28. This strategy enabled observation of fluorescent UvrA-YPet expressed from the native,

88

SOS-inducible uvrA promoter (Supplementary Movie 1). We first performed UV-survival assays to

89

assess the ability of UvrA-YPet to execute nucleotide excision repair (NER). Compared to wild-type

90

cells, uvrA-YPet cells exhibited somewhat poorer survival upon exposure to UV (Supplementary Fig.

91

1a). Considering that C-terminal fusions of UvrA are fully functional in NER23, 29, this modestly lower

92

survival of uvrA-YPet cells may be attributable to a lower efficiency of protein translation.

93

Therefore, we set out to measure the copy numbers of UvrA-YPet in uvrA-YPet cells grown in EZ-rich

94

defined media supplemented with glucose at 30 Â°C. Exponentially growing cells were deposited on a

95

modified glass coverslip at the bottom of a flow cell and visualized by illumination with 514-nm laser

96

light under continuous flow of growth medium (Fig. 2b). Images of uvrA-YPet cells revealed DNA-

97

bound UvrA-YPet molecules that manifested as static foci and diffusive molecules contributing to

98

cellular background fluorescence (Fig. 2c). These observations are consistent with its role as a damage

99

surveillance protein.

100

Exposure to laser light led to rapid loss of YPet signal due to photodarkening and photobleaching of

101

the chromophore (Supplementary Movie 1). We used this loss of signal to measure copy numbers of

102

UvrA-YPet in cells. Dividing the background-corrected cellular fluorescence intensity by the intensity

103

of a single YPet molecule revealed a copy number of 16 Â± 4 copies of UvrA-YPet per cell

104

(Supplementary Fig. 1b-d). Copy numbers of UvrA are strongly influenced by the carbon source

105

present in the growth medium, ranging from 9 - 43 copies (minimal media) to 129 copies (rich media)

106

per cell 30. These estimates exceed the copy numbers of UvrA-YPet detected in the uvrA-YPet strain

107

grown in rich medium. The lower copy numbers of UvrA-YPet are consistent with the minor

108

deficiencies in survival observed after UV exposure (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

109

To confirm the hypothesis that the deficiencies in UV survival observed for the uvrA-YPet strain are

110

attributable to lower copy numbers as opposed to a catalytically deficient protein, we created a low

111

copy plasmid (pSC101 origin of replication, 3-4 copies/cell31) expressing the C-terminal YPet fusion of

112

UvrA under its native promoter (pUvrA-YPet). We then transformed DuvrA cells with pUvrA-YPet.

113

These cells express UvrA-YPet to the extent of 120 Â± 28 copies per cell (Supplementary Fig. 1b-d). UV

114

survival assays (Supplementary Fig. 1e) revealed that UvrA-YPet expressed from the plasmid is able to

115

fully complement the DuvrA phenotype. Therefore, we conclude that the copy numbers of UvrA-YPet

116

expressed from the endogenous uvrA promoter represent lower copy numbers compared to untagged

117

UvrA expressed in wild-type cells, likely reflecting a poorer efficiency of translation of the uvrA-YPet

118

gene.

Interval imaging strategy to measure DNA binding kinetics

120

Continuous imaging of UvrA-YPet could not be used to measure DNA binding lifetimes, since the

121

apparent lifetime of a focus represents UvrA-YPet molecules dissociating from the site or bound UvrA-

122

YPet molecules that are photobleached during the imaging. Consequently, measurement of

123

interactions that last longer than the photobleaching lifetime is impossible. Instead we imaged UvrA-

124

YPet using a strategy of performing time-lapse imaging with dark periods of varying intervals (for

125

brevity, we term this mode of imaging âinterval imagingâ)12, 24, 32, 33 (Fig. 2d) that elegantly deconvolutes

126

the lifetime of the interaction of UvrA-YPet with DNA and the lifetime of the fluorescent probe. Briefly,

127

the introduction of a dark interval (td) between consecutive frames of duration (tint) extends the

128

observation time window. Here the time between consecutive frames is denoted as time-lapse time

129

(ttl). By acquiring the same number of frames in each video collected with a different dark interval,

130

the photobleaching rate (kb) is maintained constant (see Table 1 and Methods) while the observation

131

window is extended arbitrarily. From these videos, cumulative residence time distributions of DNA-

132

bound UvrA-YPet are constructed. Since these distributions reflect a mixture of two populations (UvrA

133

molecules that dissociate and YPet molecules that photobleached), fitting them to an exponential

134

function yields an effective off rate (keff)32. The product (keffttl) is a linear function of true off rate (koffttl)

135

and the normalized photobleaching rate (kbtint)32. For purposes of illustration, the data can be

136

represented as keffttl vs. ttl plots where the slope reveals the off rate koff and the Y-intercept reveals kb.

137

This interval imaging strategy enables accurate quantification of binding lifetimes over three orders of

138

magnitude from 0.1 s to several minutes12, 32, 34.

139

UvrA is long-lived on DNA in the absence of UvrB and Mfd

140

First, we interrogated UvrA binding kinetics in the absence of its two major interacting partners UvrB

141

and Mfd in growing cells. To that end, we transformed cells lacking UvrA, UvrB and Mfd (DuvrA DuvrB

142

Dmfd cells) with pUvrA-YPet. In these cells, we expected that interactions of UvrA-YPet with

143

chromosomal DNA would reflect two of its key activities: binding to non-damaged DNA and binding

144

to endogenous DNA damage produced as a by-product of cellular metabolism (Fig. 3a). Indeed,

145

measurements of UvrA-YPet kinetics of dissociation in these cells revealed two lifetimes that are an

146

order of magnitude apart - a fast lifetime (tUvrA|DuvrA DuvrB Dmfd, fast) of 1.6 Â± 0.1 s (72 Â± 2 %) and a slow

147

lifetime (tUvrA|DuvrA DuvrB Dmfd, slow) of 24 Â± 1 s (28 Â± 2 %) (summarized in Fig. 3c; Supplementary Figure 2a-

148

b, and Table 1; error bars represent standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution of values obtained

149

by performing global fits to CRTDs ten times). To eliminate the possibility that this measured lifetime

150

is affected by cellular copy numbers of UvrA, we additionally created a strain that expresses uvrA-YPet

151

from its endogenous promoter, and lacks the genes for uvrB and mfd (uvrA-YPet DuvrB Dmfd). The

152

measured lifetimes of UvrA-YPet in this strain were found to be identical within error (tUvrA|uvrA-YPet

= 22 Â± 8 s (27 Â± 4 %) and tUvrA|uvrA-YPet DuvrB Dmfd, fast = 1.4 Â± 0.4 s (73 Â± 4%)) to those in the

153

DuvrB Dmfd, slow

154

DuvrA DuvrB Dmfd/pUvrA-YPet strain (Fig. 3a and 3c, Supplementary Figure 2c-d and Table 1). Further,

155

we also measured the binding lifetime of a mutant UvrA that is deficient in its interactions with UvrB

156

and Mfd (Fig. 3b). Since UvrA interacts with both UvrB and Mfd via the interface formed by residues

157

131-250

158

250)-YPet, would be a faithful reporter of binding of kinetics of UvrA alone in uvrB+ mfd+ cells (Fig. 3b).

159

Previous biochemical characterization of a UvrA(D131-248) mutant revealed that this mutant is unable

160

to interact with UvrB and catalyze TCR and GGR22. Indeed, interval imaging of UvrA(D131-250)-YPet

161

expressed from a low-copy plasmid (pUvrA(D131-250)-YPet) in DuvrA cells produced a binding lifetime

162

(tUvrA(D131-250)) of 29.7 Â± 0.8 s (summarized in Fig. 3c, Supplementary Figure 2e-f, Table 1). It is

163

noteworthy that deletion of these residues leads to a complete abolishment of the short-lived species.

164

The reasons for this loss may lie in structural differences between the wild-type and mutant proteins.

165

Together, these results demonstrate that UvrA-YPet by itself is long-lived on DNA. Notably, the

166

lifetimes measured in our experiments reveal values that are larger than previous in vitro

167

measurements of UvrA binding29. The presence of two binding lifetimes reveals the presence of two

168

populations of UvrA on DNA.

169

UvrB dissociates DNA-bound UvrA in cells lacking Mfd

170

Next, we studied the influence of UvrB on the DNA binding lifetime of UvrA in cells lacking Mfd (uvrA-

171

YPet Dmfd cells; Fig. 3d) during normal growth. In these cells, UvrA-YPet dissociated with a fast lifetime

172

(tUvrA| Dmfd, fast) of 1.5 Â± 0.1 s (amplitude: 78 Â± 2%) and a slow lifetime (tUvrA| Dmfd, slow) of 8.7 Â± 0.4 s (22 Â±

173

2%) (summarized in Fig. 3f; Supplementary Figure 2g-h, Table 1). The lifetime of the slowly dissociating

174

species observed in our measurements matches the lifetime detected for the dissociation of UvrA in

175

the presence of UvrB previously (7 s) 29, and is consistent with measurements of UvrB loading at sites

176

of DNA damage38. Notably, the fast lifetime is consistent with measurements from a previous study23;

177

however, in this study a long-lived population of UvrA was not detected in the absence of exogenous

178

DNA damage23.

179

Several in vitro studies have revealed that damage detection during NER proceeds via the loading of

180

UvrB on DNA, followed by damage verification mediated via the helicase activity of UvrB 39, 40, 41. To

181

investigate whether the ability of UvrB to be loaded on DNA via its Î²-hairpin is essential for dissociation

182

of UvrA from DNA, we measured the lifetime of UvrA-YPet in uvrA-YPet Dmfd cells expressing the Î²-

183

hairpin deletion mutant of UvrB from the native uvrB locus (Methods). This mutant, UvrB(DbHG), is

184

inefficiently loaded on DNA in vitro 42. The lifetime (tUvrA| uvrB(DbHG) Dmfd) of UvrA-YPet in cells expressing

185

UvrB(DbHG) from the chromosome was 148 Â± 36 s (100%); over 15-fold longer than that of UvrA-YPet

35, 36, 37

, we expected that the labelled mutant UvrA lacking residues 131-250, UvrA(D131-

186

in cells lacking Mfd (Fig. 3e-f, Supplementary Figure 2i-j and Table 1). These data indicate that the

187

UvrA-UvrB(DbHG) complex is arrested on DNA.

188

The lack of a short-lived species of UvrA in cells expressing mutant UvrB implies that the detectable

189

population of UvrA can be sequestered to the chromosome in the form of a long-lived complex. Such

190

a complex has been detected in single-molecule DNA stretching assays where UvrAB was

191

demonstrated to slide on DNA 29. Additionally, we infer that in wild-type cells, loading of UvrB on DNA

192

must promote the dissociation of UvrA. Indeed, our single-molecule live-cell imaging results highlight

193

the physiological relevance of models constructed from in vitro studies that demonstrate that UvrB

194

facilitates the dissociation of UvrA from DNA 42, 43, 44. These findings lead us to suggest that the 8.7s

195

lifetime measured here corresponds to the lifetime of UvrA engaged in damage surveillance activities,

196

where UvrA is turned over by UvrB loading.

197

Mfd arrests UvrA on DNA in UvrB deficient cells

198

Next, we measured the lifetime of UvrA in cells lacking UvrB in the absence of exogenous DNA damage.

199

Under these conditions, UvrA can form surveillance complexes (UvrA2) and interact with Mfd engaged

200

with stalled RNAP. Interval imaging of UvrA-YPet in cells lacking UvrB (uvrA-YPet DuvrB) revealed a

201

single long-lived UvrA species with a lifetime (tUvrA| DuvrB) of 97 Â± 18 s (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Figure

202

3a-b). Since UvrA alone binds DNA with a lifetime of approximately 24 s, this highly stable species must

203

reflect interactions with Mfd. We propose that this slowly dissociating species reflects the arrested

204

Mfd-UvrA complex13 in cells lacking UvrB. Our attempts at co-localization of UvrA and Mfd using the

205

spectrally separated probes, YPet and PAmCherry, were limited by the poor expression of Mfd-

206

PAmCherry and UvrA-PAmCherry in cells under our standard growth conditions (Supplementary Note

207

1 and Supplementary Figure 3c-d). Considering the copy numbers of UvrA measured here (16 per cell)

208

and Mfd (22 per cell)12, and the reported picomolar affinity of UvrA for Mfd13, a large fraction of entire

209

population of UvrA can be efficiently sequestered in complex with Mfd, consistent with the

210

observation of only a single, slowly dissociating species in cells lacking uvrB.

211

UvrA is longer lived on DNA in mfd+ cells compared to mfd- cells in the absence of exogenous damage

212

We next set out to measure the residence time of DNA-bound UvrA in cells carrying both Mfd and

213

UvrB in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. UvrA is recruited to DNA via Mfd to form the

214

asymmetric handoff complex Mfd-UvrA2-UvrB that couples failed TECs to the repair machinery, unlike

215

the symmetric UvrB-UvrA2-UvrB complex formed during damage surveillance in the absence of Mfd

216

(Fig. 1). Our previous characterization of Mfd demonstrated that the residence time of Mfd is

217

governed by UvrA, suggesting that UvrA is recruited to Mfd during normal growth12. Hence, we
7

218

anticipated three scenarios for the lifetime of UvrA in wild-type cells. First, if the residence time of

219

UvrA-YPet is equal to 8.7 s, this would indicate either that the lifetimes of Mfd-UvrA and UvrA-UvrB

220

interactions are similar, or that the lifetimes are different but the recruitment of UvrAB to RNAP-

221

bound Mfd occurs so infrequently that only UvrAB complexes are detected. Second, a lifetime shorter

222

than 8.7 s would suggest that Mfd promotes the dissociation of UvrA. Finally, a lifetime longer than

223

8.7 s would indicate that Mfd stabilizes UvrA.

224

To distinguish between these three scenarios, we imaged UvrA-YPet in wild-type cells. Interval imaging

225

of UvrA-YPet revealed a short-lived species with a lifetime (tUvrA, fast) of 1.9 Â± 0.2 s (79 Â± 0.2%) and a

226

long-lived species of UvrA with a lifetime (tUvrA, slow) of 12.0 Â± 0.8 s (21 Â± 2%) (Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary

227

Figure 4a-b, Table 1). To identify whether this lifetime reflected Mfd-dependent or independent

228

interactions, we imaged uvrA-YPet cells in conditions where Mfd-RNAP interactions are abolished by

229

rifampicin (rif) treatment. Interval imaging of UvrA-YPet in rif-treated cells revealed a short-lived

230

species with a lifetime (tUvrA|rif,fast) of 1.5 Â± 0.3 s (63 Â± 3 %) and a long-lived species of UvrA-YPet

231

possessing a lifetime (tUvrA|rif, slow) of 9.6 Â± 0.6 s (37 Â± 3 %) (Fig. 4a, c, Supplementary Figure 4c-d, Table

232

1). As expected, the slow lifetime of UvrA-YPet in rif-treated cells matches that in cells lacking Mfd.

233

Further, measurements of UvrA-YPet fluorescence in rif-treated cells did not reveal a loss of YPet

234

fluorescence arising from enhanced degradation of UvrA-YPet upon rif treatment (Supplementary

235

Figure 4i). The decrease in the long-lived lifetime from 12.0 s to 9.6 s indicates that a slowly dissociating

236

species (lifetime greater than 8.7 s) of UvrA is lost upon rif treatment, one that is involved in Mfd-

237

dependent interactions. These results lead us to conclude that the interactions of Mfd-UvrAB

238

complexes are more stable than UvrAB complexes alone.

239

Since no mutants of UvrA have been identified that exclusively form the Mfd-UvrA2-UvrB complex but

240

not the UvrA2UvrB2 complex in cells, measurement of the lifetime of UvrA in the Mfd-UvrA2-UvrB

241

complex is difficult. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the lifetime of the Mfd-UvrA2-UvrB complex

242

could be influenced by the availability of downstream factors including UvrAB. We tested this

243

hypothesis by measuring the lifetime of UvrA-YPet in wild-type cells expressing UvrA-YPet from the

244

plasmid (DuvrA/pUvrA-YPet). Since UvrA can engage UvrB in solution, we reasoned that higher

245

expression levels of UvrA would bind UvrB to form the UvrA2B2 surveillance complex, leaving little free

246

UvrB for engagement with Mfd-UvrA2 complexes. Consistent with this expectation, the data revealed

247

a short-lived species with a lifetime (tUvrA|â, fast) of 2.0 Â± 0.1 s (74 Â± 2 %) and a previously unencountered

248

population of long-lived UvrA possessing a lifetime (tUvrA|â, slow) of 19 Â± 1 s (26 Â± 2%) (Fig. 4a, d,

249

Supplementary Figure 4e-f, Table 1).

250

In cells, UvrA is involved in target search (1.6 Â± 0.1 s and 24 Â± 1 s lifetimes, Fig. 3c) and damage

251

surveillance as part of UvrA2B2 (8.7 s lifetime, Fig. 3f) in addition to Mfd-dependent UvrA(B) complexes

252

(with lifetime of at least 12 s). To identify whether this long-lived UvrA species (19 Â± 1 s lifetime)

253

interacts with Mfd, we treated DuvrA/pUvrA-YPet cells with rifampicin. Under this condition, we

254

expected to recover the lifetime of UvrA as part of UvrA2 or UvrA2B2 complexes. Indeed,

255

measurements of lifetimes of UvrA-YPet in rif-treated DuvrA/pUvrA-YPet cells revealed a lifetime

256

(tUvrA|ârif, slow) of 11.5 Â± 0.6 s (25 Â± 2%) and a short lifetime (tUvrA|ârif, fast) of 1.7 Â± 0.1 s (75 Â± 2%) (Fig. 4a,

257

e, Supplementary Figure 4g-h, Table 1). The faster turnover of UvrA in response to rif treatment is

258

consistent with the inference that the lifetime of UvrA in the Mfd-UvrA2-UvrB intermediate is longer

259

than that in the UvrA2B2 intermediate in the absence of exogenous damage.

260

Notably, rif treatment of DuvrA/pUvrA-YPet cells yielded a lifetime (11.5 s) that is longer than that

261

measured for rif-treated uvrA-YPet cells (9.6 s), and cells lacking mfd (8.7 s). The simplest explanation

262

consistent with these observations is that under conditions of high relative UvrA/UvrB abundance the

263

population is composed of UvrA2B(2) complexes (lifetime of 8.7 s) and DNA-bound UvrA2 awaiting

264

turnover by UvrB (lifetime of 24 s). We suggest that at higher cellular concentrations of UvrA relative

265

to UvrB and Mfd, the existing population of UvrB is now required to turnover a greater number of

266

UvrA molecules on undamaged DNA and at sites of endogenous damage, in addition to TCR

267

intermediates. This model predicts that Mfd and UvrA must form a TCR intermediate whose

268

disassembly is contingent on the arrival of UvrB. Together these results highlight two important

269

features of prokaryotic NER: first, that damage surveillance by UvrA is highly dynamic and can be

270

readily diverted from one pathway to the other depending on the condition, and second that the

271

lifetime of individual actors is determined by the presence of downstream factors.

272

UvrA-Mfd interactions are prioritized in cells after UV irradiation

273

Next, we set out to characterize the behaviour of the UvrA in response to DNA damage. UV irradiation

274

leads to the formation of UV-induced lesions in the chromosome45. These in turn elicit the induction

275

of the SOS response during which the expression of UvrA and UvrB are upregulated46. The elevated

276

levels of UvrA promote rapid removal of UV lesions from the DNA. To quantify this SOS-induced

277

upregulation in real time, we set out to monitor the relative abundance of UvrA in cells following UV

278

irradiation.

279

Time-lapse experiments on UV-irradiated uvrA-YPet allowed us to monitor the cellular fluorescence

280

of tagged UvrA as a function of time. We immobilized uvrA-YPet cells in a flow cell with a quartz

281

window and delivered a dose of 20 Jm-2 of damaging 254-nm UV light (Fig. 5a). This was followed by

282

acquiring a single snapshot upon laser illumination with 514-nm light, every five minutes for three

283

hours. Quantification of cellular fluorescence intensities revealed that the integrated fluorescence

284

intensities of single uvrA-YPet cells increase 30 minutes after UV exposure by three-fold, consistent

285

with the rapid deregulation of the SOS inducible uvrA promoter (Fig. 5b)47, 48. UvrA copy numbers have

286

been suggested to increase from 25 to 250 copies per cell after SOS induction49. We note that since

287

the experimental conditions associated with these measurements are not available in the published

288

literature, we are unable to effectively compare our measurements with these numbers.

289

Nevertheless, the basal levels and the exact extent of fold-induction after SOS induction may depend

290

on the nature and dosage of the genotoxin, as well as growth conditions such as medium and

291

temperature. Consistent with this argument, the copy numbers of UvrA were found to rise six-fold

292

within 40 minutes of UV exposure (40 Jm-2) in cells growing at 37 Â°C in previous work 50.

293

Since UV-induced lesions are a substrate for UvrAB (reviewed in ref. 1), we then set out to measure

294

the lifetime of UvrA in UV-irradiated cells. To that end, we irradiated TCR-deficient cells (uvrA-YPet

295

Dmfd) with a pulse of 254-nm UV light delivered in situ. This was followed by interval imaging in four

296

rounds, each lasting 25 minutes. Analysis of the complete data set revealed binding kinetics of UvrA-

297

YPet corresponding to a short-lived species with a lifetime (tUvrA| Dmfd, UV fast) of 1.6 Â± 0.1 s (77 Â± 3%) and

298

a long-lived species of UvrA corresponding to a lifetime of (tUvrA| Dmfd, UV slow) 13.1 Â± 0.6 s (23 Â± 2%) (Fig.

299

5c, and Supplementary Figure 5, Table 1). Strikingly the lifetime of the slowly dissociating species was

300

larger than that detected in the absence of exogeneous DNA damage (8.7 s).

301

Seeking an explanation for the increase in binding lifetime of UvrA-YPet following UV exposure, we

302

wondered if the longer lifetime of UvrA detected in these experiments represented temporally

303

averaged measurements. Since each set of interval measurements lasted 25 min, we proceeded to

304

disaggregate each data set into the four constitutive 25-min intervals after UV exposure. Analysis of

305

the resulting data from each time window revealed that the measured lifetime of UvrA changes as a

306

function of the experimental timeline after the UV pulse (Fig. 5c, and Supplementary Fig. 5, Table 1).

307

Indeed, in the first 25 minutes, the slow lifetime of UvrA (9.6 Â± 1 s) matched that measured in the

308

absence of DNA damage (8.7 Â± 0.4 s). This lifetime increased to a maximum of 15 Â± 2 s in the 50-75

309

minute time window, finally plateauing to 15 Â± 4 s in the 75-100 minute time window after UV

310

exposure.

311

There are two main takeaways from these experiments. First, the lifetime of short-lived UvrA does not

312

change upon UV exposure, and is identical to that measured in the absence of any exogenous DNA

313

damage. We therefore conclude that this species is involved in binding undamaged DNA. Second, since

10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/515502; this version posted August 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

314

the lifetime of long-lived UvrA changes upon UV exposure, we conclude that this species is engaged

315

in DNA damage recognition.

316

Next, we repeated the interval imaging experiments on wild-type cells (uvrA-YPet) following exposure

317

to a 20 Jm-2 pulse of 254-nm UV light provided in situ. In this case, UvrA-YPet exhibited two kinetic

318

populations after UV-exposure, a short-lived population with a lifetime of 1.5 Â± 0.1 s (74 Â± 2 %) and a

319

second, longer lived population with a lifetime of 9.9 Â± 0.4 s (26 Â± 2%) (Fig. 5d, and Supplementary

320

Figure 6, Table 1). As before, we disaggregated each data set into the four constitutive 25-min intervals

321

after UV exposure. In contrast to TCR-deficient cells, the measured lifetime of UvrA in wild-type cells

322

remained low (8.4 Â± 0.6 s) in the 75-100 minute time window after UV exposure. These data indicate

323

that UvrA is turned over faster in an Mfd-dependent manner during the SOS response.

324

Next, we plotted the amplitude of the long lived species in each time-window after UV irradiation

325

(Figure 5e). In uvrA-YPet cells, the fraction of the population dissociating with a slow off rate was

326

greatest in the first 50 minutes after UV exposure (at approximately 30%), and subsequently dropped

327

rapidly to 13 Â± 2% at 100 minutes after UV. In comparison, uvrA-YPet Dmfd cells exhibited a non-linear

328

trajectory that nevertheless exhibited a similar reduction in the fraction of UvrA-YPet possessing a

329

slow off rate. The most striking difference between the two strains was apparent at the 50 minute

330

time point â cells carrying mfd exhibited a 1.5-fold greater fraction of UvrA molecules dissociating with

331

the slow lifetime. These results are broadly consistent with the expectation that as repair progresses,

332

fewer unrepaired lesions are available for UvrA to bind to.

333

We followed these studies with an investigation of the binding lifetimes of Mfd. In the absence of

334

exogenous DNA damage, the lifetime of Mfd is approximately 18 s12. Interval imaging of Mfd-YPet in

335

mfd-YPet cells exposed to UV light revealed that the lifetime of Mfd-YPet dropped during the course

336

of the SOS response, leading to an average lifetime (tMfd|UV) of 12 s (Fig. 5d, and Supplementary Figure

337

7, Table 1). Strikingly, the binding lifetime of Mfd mirrored that of UvrA in wild-type cells in the time

338

window from 25-100 min after UV, providing further evidence in support of an Mfd-UvrA complex in

339

cells.

340

Discussion

341

UvrA is the central player in NER since it performs critical functions in both GGR and TCR: First, it

342

recognizes DNA damage as UvrA2 or UvrA2B(2) and loads UvrB in GGR and second, it stimulates TCR by

343

interacting with Mfd.

344

In this work, we set out to visualize the binding behaviour of fluorescently tagged UvrA in living cells

345

over the experimentally accessible, and biologically relevant timescale of 0.1 â 1000 s. We found that

346

in live cells, UvrA exhibits foci with residence times ranging from a few hundred milliseconds, to tens

347

of seconds. Here, using single-molecule imaging in combination with chemical and genetic tools, we

348

characterized the DNA-binding lifetimes of UvrA in its interactions with its key binding partners in live

349

cells.

350

We identified that UvrA is long-lived on DNA in the absence of Mfd and UvrB with a lifetime of 24 s.

351

Consistent with previous studies demonstrating that UvrB promotes the dissociation of UvrA in vitro,

352

UvrA also dissociated faster in uvrB+ cells 42, 43, 44. The insensitivity to rif or UV treatment suggests that

353

the short-lived population of DNA-bound UvrA with a lifetime of ~2 s corresponds to UvrA engaged in

354

damage search. Additionally, we also detected a long-lived species of UvrA in untreated cells. Using

355

TCR-deficient strains and rif treatment, we assigned the lifetime of UvrA in interactions with UvrB to

356

be 8.7 s. This lifetime likely corresponds to UvrA dissociation following loading of UvrB on DNA since

357

the loading-deficient UvrB mutant arrests UvrA for 148 s (see Fig. 3). Overall, our findings are

358

consistent with a previous study that detected a short-lived UvrA species in untreated cells, and a

359

long-lived species upon UV treatment 23.

360

Three observations provide evidence for an Mfd-UvrA interaction in cells: first, cells lacking UvrB

361

exhibited UvrA-YPet foci that were five-fold longer lived compared to cells lacking both Mfd and UvrB,

362

suggesting that UvrA forms a highly stable complex with Mfd. Second, the long-lived lifetime of UvrA

363

in non-UV treated cells was sensitive to rif treatment, whereby these cells lost a slowly dissociating

364

species of UvrA upon rif treatment, presumably engaged with Mfd. Curiously, the DNA binding kinetics

365

of UvrA in Mfd-UvrA2-UvrB complexes could only be distinguished from those in UvrA2B2 under

366

conditions where UvrB was present in limiting conditions, suggesting a role for UvrB in resolving Mfd-

367

UvrA complexes in cells (Fig. 5f). A prediction of this hypothesis is that elevated concentrations of UvrB

368

would lead to an enhanced turnover of Mfd in the Mfd-UvrA2-UvrB complex. Third, experiments on

369

cells exposed to UV light revealed that the binding kinetics of UvrA mirrored those of Mfd suggesting

370

that these two proteins participate in a TCR handoff complex during the SOS response. Further, UvrA

371

is turned over faster in an Mfd-dependent manner during the SOS response compared to untreated

372

cells (Fig. 5). The elevated copy numbers of UvrA and UvrB following UV treatment (Fig. 5b and refs 47,

373

48

374

The lifetime of UvrA in TCR-deficient UV-treated cells increased to 15 s, but remained low in UV-

375

treated wild-type cells. An explanation for this striking difference may be found in work by Crowley

376

and Hanawalt 46. The differences observed in our experiments may fundamentally be attributable to

) may explain the faster turnover of UvrA during the SOS response.

377

the efficiencies with which UvrA recognizes CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts. CPD lesions51, 52 being less

378

helix distorting than 6-4 photoproducts53,

379

recognition enzymes in NER across organisms55,

380

subsequent TCR at such sites is a major mechanism for CPD removal after UV treatment46. Compared

381

to untreated cells that remove greater than 80% of CPD lesions within 40 minutes following UV

382

treatment, rif-treated cells removed less than 50% of CPD lesions at the same time point46. In contrast,

383

6-4 photoproduct removal was uninfluenced by rif treatment46. Further, this report also demonstrated

384

that the copy number of UvrAB determines whether CPDs are efficiently removed following UV

385

treatment. Considering the low expression level of UvrA-YPet in our strain (16 Â± 4 subunits per cell

386

during normal growth), it is likely that the initial time window in which UvrA is turned over rapidly in

387

Dmfd cells reflects repair of 6-4 photoproducts. The later time windows in which UvrA exhibits a

388

lifetime of 15 s may reflect repair of CPD lesions that are poorly detected by UvrA. Extending this

389

argument, the prediction from the Crowley and Hanawalt study is that the rapid turnover of UvrA in

390

wild-type cells in the 25-100 min time window reflects the repair of CPDs via TCR. Indeed, consistent

391

with this prediction, we found that the binding kinetics of Mfd mirror those of UvrA in this time period.

392

This finding is also consistent with the well-established finding that the repair of UV lesions is biphasic

393

â a period of rapid removal of 6-4 photoproducts is followed by a slower repair of CPDs46.

394

Finally, our data suggest that the enhancement of the rate of repair in TCR vs. GGR measured in bulk

395

is best explained by enhanced target search in TCR compared to GGR. This model has been previously

396

proposed in the literature based on evidence from in vitro studies6, 13. In this model, stalled RNAP is

397

recognized by Mfd, leading to the exposure of Mfdâs UvrB-homology module (BHM) that in turn acts

398

as an âflagâ for UvrAB. Damage recognition by UvrAB would then follow initial recruitment to the site

399

of the lesion. In contrast, target search during global genomic repair would comprise of repeated

400

cycles of 3D diffusion of UvrA(B) to sites of undamaged DNA followed by subsequent turn-over of UvrA

by UvrB until the damage surveillance complex stochastically encounters damaged DNA.

METHODS

405

Construction of strains and plasmids

406

Escherichia coli MG1655 uvrA-YPet was constructed using Î» Red recombination as previously

407

described for Mfd using the linker sequence described previously12. Deletion constructs were created

408

by replacing the indicated gene with a kanamycin cassette flanked by FRT sites as described

409

previously12. Sequence specified wild-type uvrA and uvrA(D131-250) geneblocks (including the native

410

uvrA promoter) were ordered from IDT (Coralville, USA) and subcloned into pHH00112 using standard

411

molecular biology techniques. Plasmids were sequenced on both strands prior to use. Strain

412

expressing mutant UvrB was created using CRISPR-Cas9 assisted Î» Red recombination as previously

413

described57, 58 (see Supplementary Methods).

414

Cell culture for imaging

415

Cells were imaged in quartz-top flow cells as described previously12. Cells were grown in 500 Î¼L of EZ-

416

rich defined media (Teknova, CA, US), supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) glucose in 2 mL microcentrifuge

417

tubes at 30 Â°C. For experiments involving plasmid-expressed UvrA-YPet or UvrA(D131-250)-YPet,

418

spectinomycin (50 Î¼g per mL) was added to the growth media. Cells in early exponential phase were

419

loaded in flow cells at 30 Â°C, followed by a constant supply of aerated EZ-rich defined media at a rate

420

of 30 ÂµL per min, using a syringe pump (Adelab Scientific, Australia).

421

Single-molecule live-cell imaging

422

Single-molecule fluorescence imaging was carried out with a custom-built microscope as previously

423

described12. Briefly, the microscope comprised a Nikon Eclipse Ti body, a 1.49 NA 100x objective, a

424

514-nm Sapphire LP laser (Coherent) operating at a power density of 71 W cm-2, an ET535/30m

425

emission filter (Chroma) and a 512 x 512 pixel2 EM-CCD camera (either Photometrics Evolve or Andor

426

iXon 897). The microscope was operated in near-TIRF illumination59 and was controlled using NIS-

427

Elements (Nikon). PAmCherry-tagged proteins were imaged as described previously12.

428

Fluorescence images were acquired in time-series format with 100 ms frames. Each video acquisition

429

contained two phases. The first phase (50 frames) aimed to lower background signal by continuous

430

illuminating, causing most of the fluorophores to photo-bleach or to assume a dark state. The second

431

phase (single-molecule phase lasting for 100 frames) is when single molecules can be reliably tracked

432

on a low background signal. In the second phase, consecutive frames were acquired continuously or

433

with a delay time (td).

434

Image analysis

435

Image analysis was performed in Fiji60, using the Single Molecule Biophysics plugins (available at

436

https://github.com/SingleMolecule/smb-plugins), and MATLAB. First, raw data were converted to TIF

437

format, following by background correction and image flattening as previously described12. Next, foci

438

were detected in the reactivation phase by applying a discoidal average filter (inner radius of one pixel,

439

outer radius of three pixels), then selecting pixels above the intensity threshold. Foci detected within

440

3-pixel radius (318 nm) in consecutive frames were considered to belong to the same binding event.

441

Interval imaging for dissociation kinetics measurements

442

Interval imaging was performed as described previously12. Briefly, the photobleaching phase

443

contained 50 continuous 0.1-s frames. In phase II, 100 discontinuous 0.1-s frames (tint = 0.1 s) were

444

collected with time-lapse time (ttl) ranging from ttl = (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10). In each experiment,

445

videos with varying td were acquired. Foci were detected using a relative intensity threshold of 7 or 8

446

above the background as appropriate. Depending on the construct being imaged, between 3-15

447

repeats of each experiment were collected for each strain. Cumulative residence time distribution of

448

binding events detected in all data sets were generated for each ttl. Cumulative residence time

449

distributions were globally fitting to single- or double-exponential models to obtain binding lifetimes

450

and amplitudes of kinetic subpopulations (custom-written MATLAB codes, see ref. 24). Here, the choice

451

of fitting model was decided based on the shape of keffttl vs. ttl plot (ref.32), in which the effective decay

452

rate keff represents the sum of the normalized photobleaching rate kb and the off rate koff (keff = kbtint

453

/ttl + koff) (ref. 32). The linearity of keffttl vs. ttl plot represents a single kinetic population whereas

454

deviations from linear fits indicate multiple kinetic subpopulations (ref. 32). The corresponding keffttl

455

vs. ttl plot was obtained as described previously12, 24, with the shaded error bar representing standard

456

deviations of ten bootstrapped samples deriving from 80% of the compiled binding events (custom-

457

written MATLAB codes)24. Given that this method is based on fitting mixtures of exponential models

458

to the data, this approach reliably resolves off rates that are at least three-fold apart. In experiments

459

involving rifampicin treatment, cells were incubated in growth media containing rifampicin (50 Î¼g per

460

mL) for 30 min in the flow cell prior to imaging.

461

Experiments involving UV irradiation

462

UV survival assays were performed as described previously in references12, 61. UV irradiation was

463

delivered in situ as described previously61. The UV flux was measured prior to UV irradiation, and the

464

exposure time was adjusted to provide a dose of 20 Jm-2. For experiments involving interval imaging

465

following UV exposure, ttl = (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10) values were used to minimize the time taken to complete

466

one round of interval imaging.

Figure 1: Nucleotide excision repair in Escherichia coli

700

Damage detection in nucleotide excision repair in E. coli proceeds via global damage surveillance

701

executed by UvrA2(B), and RNA polymerase transcribing damaged template DNA. The UvrA dimer

702

loads UvrB which verifies the presence of DNA damage in a strand-specific manner. Alternately, stalled

703

elongation complexes at the site of DNA damage are rescued by the transcription repair coupling

704

factor Mfd, which in turn recruits UvrA2(B) to the site of the stalled RNAP. This is followed by strand-

705

specific loading of UvrB at the site of the lesion. Following damage verification by UvrB, a single-

706

stranded patch of DNA containing the damage is incised by the UvrC endonuclease. This is followed

707

by repair synthesis and ligation coordinated by UvrD, PolI and LigA.

Figure 3: DNA binding lifetimes of UvrA-YPet in the presence of UvrB

727

a. Kinetics of UvrA-YPet interactions with DNA can be detected in the absence of UvrB and Mfd, in

728

DuvrA DuvrB Dmfd cells expressing UvrA-YPet from a low-copy plasmid or in DuvrB Dmfd cells

729

expressing UvrA-YPet from the chromosome.

730

b. Cartoon illustrates DNA binding by the mutant UvrA(D131-250)-YPet, which is defective in

731

interacting with UvrB and Mfd.

732

c. Bar plots represent lifetimes of DNA-bound UvrA-YPet (plasmid: n = 34,927 counts from 5 repeats;

733

chromosomal: n = 970r counts from 3 repeats) and mutant UvrA(D131-250)-YPet (a total of n = 88,232

734

counts from 4 repeats) in the corresponding genetic background. Lifetimes were obtained from

735

globally fitting the cumulative residence time distributions (CRTDs) (see also Supplementary Fig. 2a -

736

f). Where two kinetic sub-populations are detected, the fast lifetime is displayed in the lower panel.

737

Percentage represents the amplitude of kinetic sub-populations. Error bars are standard deviations

738

from ten bootstrapped CRTDs. See also source data file.

739

d. Cartoon illustrates loading of UvrB by UvrA. This may occur at sites of undamaged or damaged DNA.

740

e. Cartoon illustrates the complex formed by UvrA and the mutant UvrB(DbHG) that is deficient in

741

loading reaction.

742

f. Bar plots represent lifetimes of DNA-bound UvrA-YPet in Dmfd cells expressing either wild-type UvrB

743

(n = 29,743 counts from 11 repeats) or mutant UvrB(DbHG) (n = 16,353 counts from 2 repeats).

744

Lifetimes were obtained from globally fitting the CRTDs, with more than 1,000 counts each CRTD (see

752

a. Lifetimes of UvrA-YPet in uvrA-YPet cells or DuvrA/pUvrA-YPet cells untreated or treated with

753

rifampicin. Lifetimes were obtained from globally fitting the CRTDs (see Supplementary Figure 4 a, c,

e, g). Slow lifetime is presented in black. Fast lifetime is presented in red. Percentages represent the

755

amplitude of the slowly dissociating population. Error bars are standard deviations from ten

756

bootstrapped CRTDs. See also source data file.

757

b. In the presence of UvrB and Mfd, UvrA-YPet in uvrA-YPet cells exhibited a slow lifetime of 12.0 Â±

758

0.8 s, reflecting UvrA interactions with UvrB and Mfd (n = 20,111 counts from 8 repeats).

759

c. Rifampicin treatment abolishes Mfd-RNAP interactions, hence, UvrA-YPet is channelled towards

760

interactions with UvrB, with the slow lifetime was found to be 9.6 Â± 0.6 s (n = 15,355 counts from 3

761

repeats).

762

d. When UvrA-YPet concentration increased eight fold via the means of plasmid expression, the slow

763

lifetime of UvrA-YPet in DuvrA/pUvrA-YPet cells was found to be 19 Â± 1 s, longer than that of UvrA-

764

YPet in uvrA-YPet cells (12 s) (n = 19,853 counts from 3 repeats).

765

e. Upon rifampicin treatment, the slow lifetime of UvrA-YPet in DuvrA/pUvrA-YPet cells reduced to

766

11.5 Â± 0.6 s (n = 31,788 counts from 4 repeats).

c. Lifetimes of UvrA-YPet in TCR-deficient cells as a function of time following UV exposure. Lifetimes

776

were obtained from globally fitting the CRTDs (see Supplementary Fig. 5a-d). Error bars are standard

777

deviations from ten bootstrapped CRTDs. Lifetimes of the fast and slowly dissociating sub-populations

778

are shown in the lower and upper panels respectively. Dashed lines represent lifetimes obtained from

779

aggregated CRTDs within 100 minutes following UV exposure. The lifetimes at t = 0 minutes represent

780

those of UvrA-YPet in TCR-deficient cells during normal growth and are reproduced from Fig. 4a. (After

globally fitting the CRTDs (see Supplementary Fig. 5a-d and Supplementary Fig. 6a-d). Error bars are

789

standard deviations from ten bootstrapped CRTDs. Dash lines and error bands represent lifetimes and

790

the corresponding standard deviations obtained from aggregated CRTDs within 100 minutes following

791

UV exposure. Fitting results are available in Table 1. The lifetimes at t = 0 minutes represent those of

792

UvrA-YPet in uvrA-YPet cells during normal growth and are reproduced from Fig. 4a. Lifetime of Mfd-
