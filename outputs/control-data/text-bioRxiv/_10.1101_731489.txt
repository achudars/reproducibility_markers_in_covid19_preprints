Abstract

20

Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is one of the most widespread mutualistic symbioses, which is

21

formed between the majority of land plants and soil-borne fungi belonging to Glomeromycotina.

22

AM fungi are obligate symbionts that cannot complete their natural life cycle without a host.

23

Recent evidence suggests that lipids synthesized by a host are transferred to AM fungi that

24

possess no fatty acid synthase genes in their genome and that mutations in lipid biosynthesis-

25

related genes of the host lead the symbiotic interaction to fail (1-3). We hypothesized that lipids

26

derived from plants are crucial for AM fungal growth and reproduction. In this study, we

27

evaluated whether AM fungi can grow on medium supplied with fatty acids under asymbiotic

28

conditions without the host. Myristate led to an extensive hyphal growth of Rhizophagus

29

irregularis and an increase in biomass production. Other examined fatty acids showed no effect

30

on biomass production. Myristate also induced secondary spore formation. The myristate-

31

induced spores can germinate, colonize carrot hairy roots, and form the next generation of

32

mature daughter spores. A fluorescently labeled fatty acid probe was taken up by branched

33

hyphae of AM fungi. Tracer experiments using 13C-labeled myristic acid showed that myristate

34

and its metabolites were utilized for the synthesis of triacylglycerol and cell wall components

35

of AM fungi. Furthermore, myristate activated ATP generation in the fungal hyphae. Here we

36

demonstrate that myristate is utilized as a carbon and energy source for biomass production and

Introduction

40

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi belonging to the subphylum Glomeromycotina (4) form

41

symbiotic associations with over 70% of land plant species (5). AM fungi provide hosts with

42

minerals taken up via hyphal networks in soil and in return receive carbon sources, such as

43

sugars and lipids derived from plant photosynthates. This is regarded as an obligate symbiotic

44

relationship, where the life cycle of AM fungi is completed through colonization with their host.

45

Only a few reports have been published on AM fungal culture without hosts. One report showed

46

that the co-cultivation of the AM fungus Glomus intraradices with strains of Paenibacillus

47

validus separated from each other with dialysis membranes induced secondary spore formation

48

of the AM fungus (6). Another study reported that some fatty acids, including palmitoleic acid

49

and (S)-12-methyltetradecanoic acid, induced fertile secondary spores in asymbiotic cultures of

50

AM fungi (7). These results suggest that AM fungi may be cultured independently from host

51

plants under artificial conditions. In nature, the life cycle of AM fungi proceeds as follows.

52

Resting spores of AM fungi germinate, and then germ tubes emerge from the spores and

53

elongate into the soil. After colonization into plant roots, AM fungi form a highly branched

54

hyphal structure, called an arbuscule, in plant cortical cells, which is a site of nutrient exchange

55

between AM fungi and their hosts. After receiving carbon sources from their hosts, AM fungi

56

activate the formation of extraradical hyphal networks in soil and form spores on their hyphae.

57

A key step of AM fungal growth and reproduction is to obtain carbon sources from their hosts

58

for the production of energy and the carbon skeleton of the fungal cell components. Tracer

59

experiments and NMR analyses show that hexoses transfer to AM fungi as a carbon source (8-

60

10). Several AM fungal monosaccharide transporters have been identified (11-13). Recently,

61

lipids derived from plants have been proven to be another carbon source (1-3, 14, 15). No fatty

62

acid biosynthesis activity in extraradical hyphae has been detected, so lipids were assumed to

63

be synthesized in intraradical hyphae and transferred to extraradical hyphae and spores (10, 16).

64

However, AM fungi have no cytosolic fatty acid synthases involved in de novo fatty acid

65

biosynthesis in their genomes, indicating that AM fungi cannot produce long chain fatty acids

66

by themselves (17-20). During AM symbiosis, plants activate fatty acid biosynthesis and

67

transfer lipids, presumably 16:0 β-monoacylglycerol (β-MAG), to AM fungi via arbuscules (1-

68

3, 14, 15). In plant mutants that are defective in fatty acid biosynthetic genes, AM fungi cannot

69

develop arbuscules and reduce colonization in roots. These results indicate that AM fungi

70

require external fatty acids for their growth. Once AM fungi take up fatty acids, they can utilize

71

them using fatty acid desaturase and elongase genes that are present in their genomes and

72

expressed in intraradical hyphae (16-18, 20-23). Thus, we examined whether AM fungi can

77

Myristate activates AM fungal growth

78

Initially, we screened several fatty acids and β-MAGs to identify chemicals that promote AM

79

fungal growth under asymbiotic conditions. These compounds were added to the modified

80

Saccharomyces cerevisiae synthetic complete (SC) medium (SI Appendix, Table S1) with

81

different dissolving methods: adding an aqueous solution of fatty acid salts, fatty acids and β-

82

MAGs dissolved in ethanol, or fatty acids conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Fatty

83

acid–BSA conjugates were dissolved to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, whereas potassium

84

salts of fatty acids were converted into an insoluble form due to the formation of metal soap

85

with Ca2+ and Mg2+ in SC medium. Moreover, fatty acids and β-MAGs were aggregated in the

86

solid culture (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). In the absence of fatty acids, no biomass increase was

87

detected in R. irregularis (Fig. 1A and B). After spore germination, R. irregularis generated a

88

thick and short subtending hypha that soon branched to produce straight-growing thick hyphae

89

(hereafter referred to as runner hyphae), with several thin lateral hyphae with a low level of

90

ramification (Fig. 1D and E). The hyphal elongation ceased within one or two weeks after

91

germination. By contrast, myristates (C14:0) among the tested chemicals substantially

92

increased fungal biomass regardless of the methods used for adding myristate (Fig. 1A). Fungal

93

biomass continued to increase in the culture depending on the concentration of myristate (Fig.

94

1B). As a consequence, the total dry weight of the two-month-old colony at 1 mM potassium

95

myristate doubled that of inoculated spores. Surprisingly, 16:0 β-MAG and palmitate (16:0),

96

candidate compounds released from arbusculated host cells during symbiosis (14, 15), did not

97

increase biomass production. During cultivation with myristate, vigorous hyphal development

98

and subsequent differentiation of secondary spores were observed (Fig. 1F–P and SI Appendix,

99

Fig. S1). After germination, R. irregularis differentiated a few densely packed coil (DPC)-like

100

structures from the runner hyphae in the vicinity of an inoculated spore (Fig. 1G). DPC is an

101

extensively branched hyphal structure, which was first observed in G. intraradices co-

102

cultivated with P. validus (24). R. irregularis elongated its runner hyphae as generating

103

branched hyphae similar to branched absorbing structures (BAS) (25) and expanded its habitat

104

by generating new runner hyphae (Fig. 1H–J). The short-branched hyphae (hereafter referred

105

to as BAS) were formed at short intervals (Fig. 1K). Interestingly, at the beginning of the

106

cultivation supplemented with potassium myristate, numerous precipitates of myristate salt

107

were observed throughout the growth medium; however, the precipitates around actively

108

growing hyphae were solubilized (Fig. 1H, I, and L). Myristate induced secondary spores,

109

which were frequently observed along the runner hyphae in the vicinity of the inoculated spores

110

(Fig. 1M). Myristate-induced spores also occurred apically or intercalary along the lateral

111

branches of the extensively growing runner hyphae (Fig. 1N and O). The size of the spores was

112

approximately 50 μm in diameter, which is almost half the size of inoculated spores (Fig. 1F,

113

M, and P). In the presence of palmitoleic acid (C16:1 Δ9) in the medium, extensive hyphal

114

branching and secondary spore formation was observed as reported by Kameoka et al. (7),

115

although this was not associated with an increase in biomass (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig.

116

S1B). When lauric acid (C12:0) was applied as a lauric acid–BSA conjugate, R. irregularis

117

showed an active runner hyphae elongation with few DPC, BAS, or secondary spores (SI

118

Appendix, Fig. S1C). However, this conjugate did not significantly increase fungal biomass (Fig.

119

1A). As the lauric acid–BSA conjugate was effective on hyphal elongation even at low

120

concentrations (1 and 10 µM), lauric acid is not likely to be utilized as a macronutrient for R.

121

irregularis (SI Appendix, Fig. 1D).

122

We further developed culture systems to promote fungal growth under asymbiotic

123

conditions. First, we examined a liquid culture of the modified SC medium containing

124

potassium myristate. The liquid culture was also effective for fungal biomass production (SI

125

Appendix, Fig. S2A). After germination, precipitates of metal soaps attached to the hyphal

126

surface (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B). The fungal hyphae continued to elongate and became tangled.

127

During fungal growth, the metal soaps on the surface gradually disappeared. Typical BAS was

128

not recognized due to the aggregation of the fungal hyphae, although highly branched fine

129

hyphae were observed in the presence of myristate (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). In contrast to the

130

solid culture, very few secondary spores formed in the liquid culture. Next, an immobilized cell

131

culture system was tested, in which an inoculum of R. irregularis spores embedded in the center

132

of a Phytagel tablet was incubated in modified SC liquid medium (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). This

133

culture system can prevent the aggregation of fungal hyphae and facilitate the diffusion of

134

medium components in the Phytagel tablets. Notably, AM fungal growth in the immobilized

135

cell culture system with potassium myristate was increased at 3–4-fold compared with that in

136

the solid and liquid cultures (Fig. 1A and C; SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). The hyphal elongation was

137

very active, and some hyphae spread out to the Phytagel tablets and continued to grow (Fig. 1Q

138

and R and SI Appendix, Fig. S3B–D). The elongation pattern was similar to that in the solid

139

culture. For instance, DPC-like structures, runner hyphae, BAS, and myristate-induced spores

140

were observed (SI Appendix, Fig. S3E–I). The myristate-induced spores were still smaller than

141

the inoculated spores (SI Appendix, Fig. S3J).

142

As monosaccharides are utilized by AM fungi as carbon sources during symbiosis (8-

143

10), we examined whether monosaccharides are effective on fungal growth in an immobilized

144

cell culture system. In the absence of potassium myristate, neither glucose nor xylose promoted

145

biomass production (Fig. 1C). Similarly, no additional effect of the monosaccharides to increase

146

biomass production was detected in the combination with potassium myristate.

147
148

Myristate-induced spores have infection capability

149

Myristate-induced spores began to differentiate from two weeks after inoculation in the solid

150

medium. The number of myristate-induced spores increased with time and concentration of

151

myristate and finally reached 1.4 spores per inoculated spore at 8 weeks post-inoculation (Fig.

152

2A). However, the spores were still half the size of the inoculated spores (Fig. 2B). In the

153

immobilized cell culture system, the number of myristate-induced spores was equal to that in

154

the solid culture, and the spores were further generated up to 2.5 per inoculated spore in the

155

combination with xylose (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). Although the spore size and

156

thickness of spore walls were small (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B and Fig. S5A), the morphology of

157

the myristate-induced spores resembled that of the symbiotically generated spores (SI Appendix,

158

Fig. S5A). Both myristate-induced and symbiotically generated spores contained a large number

159

of nuclei (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). We further evaluated the capability of the myristate-induced

160

spores as propagules. Forty-six percent of the myristate-induced spores were able to germinate

161

(SI Appendix, Fig. S5B). The abundance of germ tubes from the induced spores was less than

162

that from the symbiotically generated spores, possibly due to the small spore size (SI Appendix,

9

163

Fig. S5C). To test whether the myristate-induced spores can colonize plant roots, a single spore

164

generated in the immobilized cell culture system with potassium myristate and xylose was

165

inoculated to carrot hairy roots. In total, 245 spores were examined in six independent

166

experiments. Some induced spores had infectivity to the hairy roots; and as a result, mature

167

spores of the next generation were produced on the extraradical hyphae that emerged from the

168

roots (Fig. 2D–G). Approximately half of the germinated spores can colonize hairy roots and

169

produce daughter spores, albeit large variations in the germination and infectivity of spores

170

were observed among the trials due to the experimental manipulations (SI Appendix, Table S3).

171
172

AM fungi utilize myristate as a carbon and energy source

173

To address the use of fatty acids by AM fungi under asymbiotic conditions, we analyzed fatty

174

acid uptake using a fluorescent derivative of fatty acid, C1-BODIPY 500/510 C12, in the

175

immobilized cell culture system. The fluorescent probe was absorbed by the BAS (not the

176

runner hyphae) within 10 min of the exposure (Fig. 3A). The probe was first taken up from the

177

hyphal tips of BAS (Fig. 3A), and then the fluorescent signals were observed in lipid body-like

178

structures (26, 27) in the runner hyphae over time, which were translocated by cytoplasmic

179

streaming (SI Appendix, Movie S1). Long exposure of the probe showed that the signals were

180

localized in the myristate-induced spores as well as BAS, runner hyphae, and DPC, but

181

inoculated parent spores were rarely labeled (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Translocation of the

182

fluorescent fatty acid probe to the myristate-induced spores prompted us to examine whether

183

myristate is utilized as a component of the major storage lipid, triacylglycerol. We cultured R.

184

irregularis in the medium supplemented with [1-13C]myristic acid. After extraction of the lipids

185

from the fungal materials, triacylglycerol was purified through preparative TLC and analyzed

186

by 13C-NMR. In the spectrum, two peaks at 173.1 and 173.4 ppm (corresponding to the carboxyl

187

carbons of acyl chains at the α and β positions, respectively) were observed at a much higher

188

intensity compared with those of triacylglycerol prepared from monoxenically cultured R.

189

irregularis (Fig. 3B). This finding shows that exogenous myristate is incorporated into

190

triacylglycerol, especially as acyl carboxyl components. To further examine whether myristate

191

provides the carbon skeleton for fungal cell components, we applied [1-13C]myristate to the

192

solid culture medium and analyzed cell wall components. After the extraction of fungal cell

193

walls, chitin and chitosan in the cell walls were converted into glucosamine through acid

194

hydrolysis. LC-MS analysis of the extracted glucosamine demonstrated that the relative ion

195

intensity of M+1 was significantly higher in AM fungi supplemented with [1-13C]myristate

196

(mean 14.6%) than in those supplemented with non-labeled myristate (6.5%). This finding

197

indicates that external myristate was taken up by R. irregularis and utilized for the biosynthesis

198

of chitin and chitosan of the fungal cell walls (Fig. 3C). To evaluate myristate as an energy

199

source, ATP production was measured after the application of myristate. We applied myristate

200

to germinating hyphae and measured ATP content at 12 h after application. ATP content

201

increased by 2.4-fold in the presence of myristate compared with that in the absence of myristate

202

(Fig. 3D). When carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an inhibitor of

203

depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, was simultaneously applied to the hyphae,

204

ATP content did not increase independently of fatty acid application. We also confirmed that

205

potassium myristate activated gene expression involved in β-oxidation, the glyoxylate cycle,

206

gluconeogenesis, and the TCA cycle at 3 h after the application (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, a gene

207

encoding N-myristoyl transferase (NMT), which catalyzes the myristoylation of proteins was

208

upregulated by myristate.

209
210

Discussion

211

AM fungi have an obligate biotrophic lifestyle, so these fungi cannot possibly grow and survive

212

without host-derived nutrients. Recently, AM fungi have been shown to receive lipids via

213

arbuscules from the host (1-3, 14, 15); however, the availability of lipids as nutrient is largely

214

unknown. Here we show that myristate (C14:0) is used for the hyphal growth of R. irregularis

215

as a carbon and energy source under asymbiotic conditions, which provides the first evidence

216

of the increase of AM fungal biomass in a pure culture system. Furthermore, we confirmed that

12

217

myristate-induced spores are infective propagules capable of generating symbiotic daughter

218

spores. Based on lipid profile analyses of plant mutants defective in arbuscule formation, 16:0

219

β-MAG or its related chemicals are transferred to AM fungi from the host under symbiotic

220

conditions (1-3, 14, 15). Recently, palmitoleic acid, a monounsaturated C16 fatty acid, has been

221

shown to induce hyphal branching and fertile spores in the absence of a host (7). However, fatty

222

acids and β-MAGs except for myristate were ineffective in biomass production in our culture

223

conditions. From our result that the fluorescently labelled fatty acid derivative C1-BODIPY

224

500/510 C12 was accumulated in AM fungal hyphae, fatty acids are likely to be non-specifically

225

taken up. Rather, myristate seems to be essential for biological processes in AM fungi via a

226

myristate-specific metabolism. Myristate is used for the lipid modification of proteins, called

227

protein N-myristoylation, in a variety of eukaryotes (28-30). Protein N-myristoylation is

228

catalyzed by NMT, which transfers myristate from myristoyl-CoA to the N-terminal glycine

229

residue of the target proteins (31). N-myristoyl proteins are involved in diverse cellular

230

processes such as protein phosphorylation and signal transduction. Disruption of the NMT gene

231

causes recessive lethality in several fungal species (32-34). In the present study, the R.

232

irregularis NMT1 gene was upregulated by the application of myristate. Protein N-

233

myristoylation may be activated in R. irregularis by externally supplied myristate, which allows

234

it to proliferate.

235

Under conditions where myristate was supplied in the absence of a host, AM fungi

236

formed DPC-like structures after germination, explored the media by developing runner hyphae

237

in association with BAS formation, and subsequently differentiated secondary spores. We found

238

that R. irregularis has the capability to absorb fatty acids through BAS and DPC. Absorbed

239

fatty acids or their metabolites are likely to be stored in lipid bodies or glyoxysomes and

240

translocate in runner hyphae as previously observed in symbiotic extraradical hyphae (27, 35,

241

36). A part of the fatty acids or lipids is delivered to newly formed spores, which may be used

242

for spore germination and subsequent hyphal elongation.

243

The observation of incorporating 13C in triacylglycerols and cell wall components of

244

R. irregularis when [1-13C]myristate is supplied indicates that myristate is utilized as a carbon

245

source to synthesize cellular components. During symbiosis, β-oxidation, the glyoxylate cycle,

246

and gluconeogenesis are active in AM fungi, and these metabolic pathways have been proposed

247

to play a crucial role in the generation of carbohydrates from lipids (10, 35-37). Based on our

248

observation that major genes involved in β-oxidation, the glyoxylate cycle, gluconeogenesis,

249

and the TCA cycle were induced by the application of myristate, absorbed myristate is likely

250

metabolized via such metabolic pathways and resulting carbohydrates are used to build the

251

fungal cells. Furthermore, ATP elevation through myristate addition indicates that myristate is

252

also used as an electron donor for the respiration of AM fungi. In our culture systems, hexoses

253

did not give rise to an increase in fungal biomass, although xylose in combination with myristate

254

induced a great number of secondary spores. This finding means that AM fungi are hardly able

255

to use sugars for carbon sources under these conditions. However, hexoses derived from the

256

host are taken up via fungal monosaccharide transporters in intraradical hyphae and/or

257

arbuscules during symbiosis (9). In addition, the monosaccharide transporter MST2 is expressed

258

even in BAS formed on the medium in a carrot hairy root system (23) and induced in

259

extraradical hyphae applied with xylose (12). Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that AM

260

fungi can utilize external sugars for their growth under asymbiotic conditions.

261

In conclusion, we proved that AM fungi are fatty acid auxotrophs, which leads to the

262

possibility of generating a pure culture of biotrophic AM fungi. Although myristate initiates

263

AM fungal growth and sporulation, the size of myristate-induced spores remains small

264

compared with that of symbiotically generated spores. Similar results were obtained with

265

palmitoleic acid-induced spores (7). As smaller spores show low germination rates and

266

infectivity (38), spore maturation in the absence of the host represents an exciting future

267

challenge for the pure culture of AM fungi. Our findings have shed new light on the cellular

268

and molecular biology of AM fungi, and have important implications for the genetic

269

transformation and the development of new strategies for the inoculum production of these

270

organisms.

Tech. Contaminated hyphae in the spore suspension were removed by density-gradient

278

centrifugation using gastrografin as described in SI Appendix, Extended Methods.

279
280

Asymbiotic culture. Approximately 300–400 spores of R. irregularis were inoculated on 0.3%

281

Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich) plates containing modified SC medium (1.7 g l−1 yeast nitrogen base

282

[MP Biomedicals], 2.0 g l−1 complete SC mixture [Formedium], 5 mM ammonium sulfate, 1

283

mM glycerol, 5 mg l−1 thiamine hydrochloride, 5 mg l−1 nicotinic acid, 5 mg l−1 pyridoxal

284

phosphate, and appropriate amounts of fatty acids) and then covered with 0.3% Phytagel

285

dissolved in 3 mM magnesium sulfate in a 12-well culture plate. For the liquid culture, Phytagel

286

was removed from the medium. Three types of fatty acids were added to the medium: fatty acid

287

salts, fatty acids in an organic solvent, or fatty acids conjugated with BSA (SI Appendix,

288

Immobilized cell culture. An overview of the immobilized cell culture system is represented

292

in the SI Appendix (Fig. S3A). Thirty-five ml of 0.75% Phytagel containing 3 mM magnesium

293

sulfate was poured into a 90 mm Petri dish and solidified. A Phytagel tablet (6 mm high and

294

17.5 mm wide) with a circular incision (3 mm deep and 11.5 mm wide) was cut out using a

295

sterile double cork borer (inner diameter: 11.5 and 17.5 mm, respectively). The gel within the

296

circular incision on the top side of the gel tablet was removed to 3 mm deep using a spatula or

297

disposable pipette tip connected to an aspirator to prepare a hole for spore inoculation. To flatten

298

the bottom of the hole, a small amount of 0.75% Phytagel was added. Approximately 300–400

299

spores were placed in the hole and covered with 0.75% Phytagel containing 3 mM magnesium

300

sulfate. The Phytagel tablets containing spores were transferred into a six-well culture plate.

301

Each well was filled with 5 mL of full- or half-strength modified SC liquid medium with or

302

without 0.5 mM potassium myristate and monosaccharides (glucose and xylose). AM fungi

303

were grown at 28 ºC in the dark. During the culture, the medium was changed once a month.

308

The number of inoculated spores in the well was counted in advance under a dissecting

309

microscope. The standardized growth increment of R. irregularis was calculated by dividing

310

the total fungal dry weight in a well by the number of inoculated spores and subtracting the

311

mean dry weight of an inoculated spore.

Spore morphology and germination assay. Myristate-induced spores were produced by an

314

immobilized cell culture system in the presence of 0.5 mM potassium myristate in a half-

315

strength modified SC medium for approximately three months. Myristate-induced and

316

symbiotically generated spores were mounted with polyvinyl alcohol–lactic acid–glycerol

317

(PVLG) or Melzer's reagent for microscopic observation. Spores were incubated with 10 µM

318

SYTO 13 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain (Thermo Fisher) for 2 h and observed by

319

epifluorescence microscopy. For spore germination assay, myristate-induced and symbiotically

320

generated spores were placed onto 0.3% Phytagel containing 3 mM magnesium sulfate and

321

incubated at 28 ºC for one week. Spore germination was examined under a dissecting

333

with modified SC medium containing 0.5 mM potassium myristate without sugars for 4 or 6

334

weeks. Fungal hyphae were stained with 0.5 mM C1-BODIPY 500/510 C12 in modified SC

335

medium. After a 10-minute the incubation, fungal hyphae protruding outside a Phytagel tablet

336

were observed using a laser scanning confocal microscope. For the samples incubated for 1 or

337

5 days in the medium containing the fluorescent probe, a Phytagel tablet containing fungal

362

for 12 h. After centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 10 min, 400 µL of phosphate-buffered saline

363

(PBS; pH 7.4) was added to the pellet. The spore suspension was transferred to a 2 mL tube

364

containing a metal crusher (TAITEC) and placed on ice. The sample was crushed with a bead

crusher (µT-12, TAITEC) at 2,200 rpm for 10 s three times. The crushed fungal materials were

366

transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuged at 8,000×g for 2 min at 4 ºC. The supernatant was

367

recovered and used for determination of ATP and protein concentration. ATP concentration was

368

measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit (Promega) following

369

the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was assayed using the Qubit Protein

380

After a 3 or 12 h incubation, fungal hyphae protruding outside a Phytagel tablet were recovered

381

using forceps and immediately immersed in 500 μL of RNAiso Plus (Takara Bio). The fungal

382

hyphae were crushed using the bead crusher μT-12 with a metal crusher at 2,200 rpm for 10 s

383

three times with cooling on ice. RNA purification, cDNA synthesis, and semiquantitative PCR

384

was conduct as described in SI Appendix, Extended Methods.
