ABSTRACT

24

Establishing the pattern of abundance of molecules of interest during cell division has been a

25

long-standing goal of cell cycle studies. In several systems, including the budding yeast

26

Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell cycle-dependent changes in the transcriptome are well studied.

27

In contrast, few studies queried the proteome during cell division, and they are often plagued by

28

low agreement with each other and with previous transcriptomic datasets. There is also little

29

information about dynamic changes in the levels of metabolites and lipids in the cell cycle. Here,

30

for the first time in any system, we present experiment-matched datasets of the levels of RNAs,

31

proteins, metabolites, and lipids from un-arrested, growing, and synchronously dividing yeast

32

cells. Overall, transcript and protein levels were correlated, but specific processes that appeared

33

to change at the RNA level (e.g., ribosome biogenesis), did not do so at the protein level, and

34

vice versa. We also found no significant changes in codon usage or the ribosome content during

35

the cell cycle. We describe an unexpected mitotic peak in the abundance of ergosterol and

36

thiamine biosynthesis enzymes. Although the levels of several metabolites changed in the cell

37

cycle, by far the most significant changes were in the lipid repertoire, with phospholipids and

38

triglycerides peaking strongly late in the cell cycle. Our findings provide an integrated view of the

39

abundance of biomolecules in the eukaryotic cell cycle and point to a coordinate mitotic control

40

of lipid metabolism.

INTRODUCTION

42

Exemplified by the discovery of cyclin proteins (Evans et al., 1983), identifying biomolecules

43

whose abundance changes in the cell cycle has been a critical objective of cell cycle studies for

44

decades. Recognizing such molecular landmarks in the cell cycle is a valuable, and often

45

necessary, step for deciphering how and why cell cycle pathways are integrated.

46

Over the last twenty years, cell cycle-dependent changes in mRNA levels during the cell

47

cycle of S. cerevisiae have been comprehensively defined not only from several arrest-and-

48

release synchronization approaches (Cho et al., 1998; Spellman et al., 1998; de Lichtenberg et

49

al., 2005; Pramila et al., 2006; Granovskaia et al., 2010), but also elutriation (Spellman et al.,

50

1998; Blank et al., 2017). Unlike transcript profiling, cell cycle-dependent proteomic and

51

metabolomic changes have been more limited and challenging to interpret due to different or

52

poor synchronization, lack of matched transcriptomic datasets, and divergent results among the

53

various studies. For example, there has only been one mass spectrometry-based proteomic

54

analysis of the budding yeast cell cycle, sampling cultures at four time-points after they were

55

released from arrest (Flory et al., 2006). Remarkably few proteins had altered levels during the

56

time course of that experiment, and there was no correlation with the available transcriptomic

57

datasets (Flory et al., 2006). Hence, at least in S. cerevisiae, it is not clear to what extent protein

58

abundances are dynamic in the cell cycle, and how tightly they are linked to transcriptional

59

changes, if at all.

60

The picture is not much clearer in other experimental systems. In fission yeast, two

61

recent studies used highly similar arrest-and-release synchronization and protein labeling

62

(stable isotope labeling by amino acids in the cell culture (Mann, 2006)) methods, followed by

63

mass spectrometry, to probe cell cycle-dependent changes in the proteome. In one study only a

64

single protein changed in abundance more than 2-fold (Carpy et al., 2014), while in the other

65

report ~150 proteins did (Swaffer et al., 2016). Neither study had experiment-matched

66

transcriptomic datasets. Previously, hundreds of transcripts were reported to be periodic in the

67

cell cycle of fission yeast (Rustici et al., 2004; Oliva et al., 2005).

68

In human cells, several reports sampled the proteome in the cell cycle with mass

69

spectrometry, but there is little consensus among them (Dephoure et al., 2008; Olsen et al.,

70

2010; Lane et al., 2013; Ly et al., 2014; Becher et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2018; Schillinger et al.,

71

2018). The fraction of proteins identified as periodic ranged from ~5% (Ly et al., 2014), to >65%

72

(Schillinger et al., 2018). Synchronization was mostly achieved by release from chemical arrest,

73

but two studies also used elutriation (Ly et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2018). In the only report where

74

an experiment-matched transcriptomic dataset was generated (Ly et al., 2014), the correlation

75

with transcript abundance was positive (ρ=0.63, based on the Spearman rank correlation

76

coefficient). Some of the differences among the above studies may arise from the use of

77

different cell lines, such as: HeLa (Dephoure et al., 2008; Olsen et al., 2010; Lane et al., 2013;

78

Becher et al., 2018); K562 (Dai et al., 2018); SW480 (Schillinger et al., 2018); or NB4 (Ly et al.,

79

2014). However, even for the same cell line (HeLa), synchronization (release from thymidine

80

block and nocodazole arrest), and point in the cell cycle (0.5 h after nocodazole arrest), the

81

relative change in abundance of the 3,298 proteins identified in common between the two

82

studies (Olsen et al., 2010; Becher et al., 2018) was uncorrelated (ρ=0.097, based on

83

Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient; see Materials and Methods).

84

In S. cerevisiae, metabolites have been measured in the cell cycle after arrest-and-

85

release synchronization in minimal medium with ethanol as a carbon source, focusing on

86

exogenous control of cell cycle progression and downstream effects on metabolism (Ewald et

87

al., 2016). At the G1/S transition, it is generally thought that cyclin-dependent kinase activity

88

triggers lipolysis (Kurat et al., 2009) and mobilizes storage carbohydrates (Ewald et al., 2016;

89

Zhao et al., 2016), to provide resources for cell division. In other systems, there is evidence of

90

cell cycle-dependent changes on metabolite levels for the green alga Chlamydomonas

reinhardtii (Juppner et al., 2017), fly (Sanchez-Alvarez et al., 2015), and human HeLa cells

92

(Atilla-Gokcumen et al., 2014; Scaglia et al., 2014; Ahn et al., 2017). Despite these advances,

93

there has been no experiment-matched sampling of the transcriptome or proteome in any of

94

these studies, making it difficult to integrate these datasets with gene expression, at the mRNA

95

or protein levels.

96

Here, for the first time in any system, we generated comprehensive datasets for RNAs,

97

proteins, metabolites, and lipids, from the same samples of S. cerevisiae cells progressing

98

synchronously in the cell cycle. Importantly, these samples were from elutriated, un-arrested

99

cells, maintaining as much as possible the normal coupling between cell growth and division.

100

We found that while there is a broad correlation between the relative abundances of mRNAs

101

and their corresponding proteins, cell cycle-dependent changes in transcriptional patterns are

102

significantly dampened at the proteome level. The cellular lipid profile is highly cell cycle-

103

regulated, with triglycerides and phospholipids peaking late in the cell cycle, together with

104

protein levels of ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes, highlighting the importance of integrating

105

multiple ‘omic’ datasets to identify cell cycle-dependent cellular processes.

RESULTS

107

Samples for the multi-omic cell cycle analysis

108

To apply genome-wide methods for the identification of cell cycle-dependent changes in the

109

abundance of molecules of interest, one must first obtain highly synchronous cell cultures.

110

Preferably, synchronization must be achieved in a way that minimally perturbs cellular

111

physiology and the coordination between cell growth and division (Mitchison, 1971; Aramayo

112

and Polymenis, 2017). When cells are chemically or genetically arrested in the cell cycle to

113

induce synchrony, known arrest-related artifacts can bias the results (Mitchison, 1971; Ly et al.,

114

2015; Aramayo and Polymenis, 2017). An alternative synchronization method is elutriation, a

115

physical process that fractionates an asynchronous cell population by cell size and

116

sedimentation density properties of the cells, with minimal perturbation of cellular functions

117

(Lindahl, 1948; Creanor and Mitchison, 1979; Banfalvi, 2008). Hence, we used centrifugal

118

elutriation to obtain our synchronous cell cultures (see Materials and Methods, and Figure 1A).

119

Elutriation separates cells primarily based on size, and size is used as a normalizing reference

120

across different elutriation experiments. We isolated 101 different elutriated cultures, which were

121

combined into 24 pools, based on the size at which they were harvested. Hence, we generated

122

a cell size-series, spanning a range from 40 to 75 fL, sampled approximately every 5 fL

123

intervals. These 24 pools were processed as independent samples in all analytical downstream

124

pipelines. For statistical analysis (e.g., with the bootstrap ANOVA), the 24 cell size pools were

125

grouped in 8 groups, for each of the approximately 5 fL increments in the cell size series (see

126

Figure 1A). The same 24 distinct pools were aliquoted as needed (see Materials and Methods)

127

to generate the input samples for measurements of RNA (with RNAseq), proteins (with LC-

128

MS/MS), and metabolites (GC-TOF MS for primary metabolites; HILIC-QTOF MS/MS for

129

biogenic amines; and CSH-QTOF MS/MS for lipids).

130

To gauge the synchrony of our samples by microscopy, we used budding as a

131

morphological landmark, which roughly coincides with the initiation of DNA replication in S.

132

cerevisiae (Pringle, 1981). The percentage of budded cells across the cell size series (Figure

133

1B) rose steadily from ~0% in the smallest cells (at 40 fL), to >80% at the largest cell size (75

134

fL). The cell size at which half the cells were budded (a.k.a. ‘critical size’, a proxy for the

135

commitment step START) in our cell size series was ~62 fL (Figure 1B). This value is the same

136

as the critical size these cells display in typical time-series experiments (Hoose et al., 2012). We

137

also measured the DNA content of the cells with flow cytometry, confirming the synchrony of the

138

samples (Figure S1). From the RNAseq data that we will describe later (Figure 2), mRNAs that

139

are known to increase in abundance at the G1/S transition (G1 cyclins; CLN1,2), or later in G2

140

phase (cyclin CLB2), peaked as expected in the cell size series (Figure 1C). Hence, based on

141

cytological (Figures 1B and S1) and molecular (cyclin mRNAs, Figure 1C) markers of cell cycle

142

progression, the synchrony of our samples was of high quality.

143
144

Overview of the datasets

145

One type of extract was analyzed for each class of the following biomolecules: RNA, primary

146

metabolites, biogenic amines, and lipids (see Materials and Methods and Table S1). For

147

proteomic analysis, we used soluble protein extracts (designated as ‘sol’ in the datasets, see

148

Table S1) and material from the same extract that was recovered in an insoluble pellet

149

(designated as ‘pel’ in the datasets, see Table S1). The pellet was subsequently solubilized with

150

detergents (see Materials and Methods) and analyzed in parallel to the soluble sample by liquid

151

chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For label-free relative quantification

152

of proteins, we used both spectral counts (designated as ‘psm’ in the datasets, see Table S1)

153

and peak areas (designated as ‘pa’ in the datasets, see Table S1). For RNAs, the signal we

154

used for quantification was read counts, either raw or after normalization as Transcripts Per

155

kilobase Million (TPM) (see Materials and Methods and Table S1). For the metabolites, the

156

signal was the peak heights from mass spectrometry (designated as ‘ph’ in the datasets, see

157

Table S1). The raw values for all datasets are in File1.

158

For the quantification of proteins and metabolites, each dataset was first normalized for

159

input. Hence, for proteins or metabolites, comparisons across the 24 samples were scaled

160

based on the sum of the signals detected in each of the 24 samples. For RNA, we used TPM-

161

normalized values and raw reads (see Table S1). All input datasets that entered the

162

downstream computational analyses are in File2. For each dataset, we used a bootstrap-based

163

ANOVA (see Materials and Methods; the output files named as ‘anova’ in the datasets, see

164

Table S1). Also, for RNA, we used the DESeq2 pipeline ((Love et al., 2014); see Materials and

165

Methods; the output file designated as ‘deseq2’, see Table S1). All output datasets are in File3.

166

Only biomolecules that changed ≥2-fold in our cell size series, and had an adjusted p-value or

167

FDR<0.05, were considered as significantly changing in the cell cycle.

168

For display purposes, in all the heatmaps and most plots, we show Log2-transformed

169

expressed ratio values. These are the ratios of the levels that we measured for each

170

biomolecule in each cell cycle point, reflecting the magnitude of the ratio of abundance relative

171

to the average of that biomolecule across all the cell cycle points we sampled. This approach

172

was originally used to describe microarray cell cycle experiments in yeast (Spellman et al.,

173

1998), and has been the standard in displaying and analyzing differential expression in the cell

174

cycle.

175
176

RNAs in the cell cycle

177

The RNAseq data were analyzed (see Materials and Methods, Figure 2, and Table S1), to

178

identify RNAs that change in abundance in the cell cycle. The names of all the RNAs in each set

179

are shown in File4/ Sheet: ‘rna_sets’. The number of identified RNAs varied, depending on the

180

computational method. Based on the DESeq2 approach, ~40% of the transcripts (n=2,456)

181

were significantly different between any two points in the cell cycle. The ANOVA-based

182

approach identified 652 RNAs, whose levels changed significantly in the cell size series (Figure

183

2). In addition to the expected clusters of RNAs associated with DNA replication (cluster 2) and

184

mitotic cell cycle progression (cluster 4), there was a large cluster of transcripts enriched for

185

processes related to ribosome biogenesis (cluster 1, Figure 2; see also File4), peaking in the G1

186

phase. These transcripts also appeared periodic in past studies that relied on elutriation as a

187

synchronization method to identify cell cycle-regulated RNAs (Spellman et al., 1998; Blank et

188

al., 2017), but not in studies that used arrest-and-release methods (Spellman et al., 1998). An

189

increase in the levels of transcripts involved in ribosome biogenesis before commitment to

190

division has also been described in transcriptomic profiles of S. pombe (Oliva et al., 2005).

191

Despite these changes at the transcript level, whether the ribosome content of the cell changes

192

during the cell cycle is not known. We will describe results that do not support any cell cycle-

193

dependent changes in assembled ribosomes (Figure 4).

194

Early in the cell cycle (cluster 1 & 3, Figure 2), we noticed that there were some tRNAs

195

whose levels were higher. Note that tRNAs were not examined in the two prior studies that

196

queried the transcriptome of elutriated S. cerevisiae cells, because those studies focused on

197

polyA-tailed selected transcripts (Spellman et al., 1998; Blank et al., 2017). It has been argued

198

that polyA selection biases the transcriptome quantification (Weinberg et al., 2016). Hence, in

199

this study, we relied only on rRNA subtraction to prepare the RNAseq libraries (see Materials

200

and Methods), which does not remove tRNAs and other non-coding RNAs. We also note that

201

tRNAs are notoriously difficult to measure by RNAseq due to factors such as their high level of

202

modification, sequence similarity between different tRNAs, and the difficulty to discriminate

203

between cleaved and mature tRNAs. The tRNAs whose levels appeared to change in the cell

204

cycle are shown in Figure S2. These results are difficult to reconcile with the extreme stability of

205

mature tRNAs (from 9 h to several days -exceeding the duration of multiple cell cycles, see

206

(Hopper, 2013)), unless these tRNAs are targets of quality control mechanisms (Hopper, 2013).

207

In any case, as we show later (Figure S6) we found very little evidence to support a significant

208

role for altered codon usage in the cell cycle.

209
210

Cell cycle-dependent changes in the proteome

211

From the soluble and insoluble extracts (see Materials and Methods), we identified 3,571 S.

212

cerevisiae proteins, at one or more cell cycle points. Although this represents a reasonably

213

thorough sampling of the yeast proteome, we did not find some low abundance proteins (e.g.,

214

cyclins). This was not unexpected, since a recent, aggregate analysis of all available datasets of

215

protein abundances in yeast (measured with tandem affinity purification (TAP), followed by

216

immunoblot analysis-, mass spectrometry-, and GFP tag-based methods), placed proteins of

217

the gene ontology process ‘mitotic cell cycle regulation’ as the least abundant group (Ho et al.,

218

2018). The extent to which mRNA levels can explain protein levels is debated (Lu et al., 2007;

219

Vogel and Marcotte, 2012; Csardi et al., 2015; Lahtvee et al., 2017). For most species, RNA

220

levels explain between one to two-thirds of the variation in protein abundances (Vogel and

221

Marcotte, 2012). To examine the broad correlation between transcript and protein levels, we

222

looked at the association of count data from our transcriptomic (reads) and proteomic (spectral

223

counts) datasets (Figure S3). Across all the points in our cell size series, the Spearman rank

224

coefficients (ρ) for the transcriptome-proteome correlations ranged from 0.52 to 0.63 (Figure

225

S3).

226
227

To identify proteins that changed in abundance in the cell cycle, we examined separately
each of the four proteomic datasets: soluble and insoluble extracts, each quantified by spectral

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.17.880252; this version posted December 18, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint

228

counts and by peak areas (see Table S1 and Materials and Methods). The overlap between the

229

proteins in each dataset that appeared to change in abundance in the cell cycle was minimal

230

(see Figure S4). Based on ANOVA analysis, we identified 333 proteins whose levels changed

231

significantly in the cell size series, in at least one of the four proteomic datasets (shown in the

232

heatmap, in Figure 3B). We will describe additional proteins whose levels change significantly in

233

the cell cycle, but due to irregular patterns and missing values were not identified as such by the

234

ANOVA-based method we used (see Figure 5).

235

Our analysis provided numerous examples of physiologically relevant, cell cycle-

236

dependent changes in protein abundance. Among these, were several whose levels are well

237

known to be periodic at both the protein and RNA levels. These include proteins involved in

238

DNA replication-related processes, such as both isoforms (Rnr1p and Rnr3p) of the large

239

subunit of ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase, peaking as cells enter S phase (Figure 3A,

240

bottom). However, other groups of proteins that we found to change in abundance in the cell

241

cycle, were not so at the RNA level. For example, several enzymes of ergosterol biosynthesis

242

(Erg1,11,3,5,7p) peaked late in the cell cycle (Figure 3A, top). Of those, only the levels of the

243

mRNA for Erg3p (C-5 sterol desaturase) changed in the cell cycle (see File4/Sheet:

244

‘rnas_anova_heatmap’). The coordinate upregulation in the levels of enzymes involved in

245

ergosterol biosynthesis is consistent with the mitotic increase in lipid levels that we will describe

246

later (Figure 6).

247

Despite the transcriptional upregulation in G1 of transcripts involved in ribosome

248

biogenesis (see Figure 2), we did not observe such broad changes at the proteomic level. In

249

earlier reports, the synthesis of ribosomal components was not cell cycle-dependent (Shulman

250

et al., 1973; Elliott et al., 1979; Warner, 1999). To our knowledge, however, it is not known if the

251

ribosome content in the cell, or the composition of ribosomal proteins in assembled ribosomes,

252

changes in the cell cycle. Hence, we asked if the total amount of ribosomal proteins or their

253

proportion in assembled ribosomes varies significantly in the cell cycle. To this end, we isolated

254

assembled ribosomes through sucrose ultra-centrifugation from wild type cells (Figure 4A; see

255

Materials and Methods). Ribosomal protein abundance was measured with SWATH-mass

256

spectrometry (see Materials and Methods). Note that for this experiment, extracts were not

257

made from pools of different elutriated cultures, but from the same early G1 elutriated cells at

258

different points as they progressed in the cell cycle (see Materials and Methods). Neither the

259

sum of all ribosomal protein abundances (Figure 4B) nor the relative abundance of the

260

individual ribosomal proteins were significantly different in the cell cycle (Figures 4C and S5).

261

These results do not support, but also do not unambiguously exclude, the possibility that

262

individual, specialized ribosomes may be formed during the cell cycle. However, at least based

263

on these population-averaged measurements, ribosome levels and the composition of

264

assembled ribosomes seem unaffected in the cell cycle.

265

Lastly, we interrogated our proteomic data for evidence of differences in codon usage

266

during the cell cycle. It has been proposed that optimal codon usage is more prevalent in

267

mRNAs expressed in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, contributing to the abundance of proteins

268

that peak in G1 (Frenkel-Morgenstern et al., 2012). Altered tRNA abundances during stress

269

conditions in S. cerevisiae may also regulate protein synthesis (Torrent et al., 2018). To avoid

270

confounding effects from differential transcription of RNAs encoding the proteins that we

271

identified to change in abundance in the cell cycle (Figure 3B), we focused on the proteins

272

whose corresponding mRNAs were not changing in the cell cycle (Figure 2). Moreover, to

273

minimize effects from regulated proteolysis, we excluded from the analysis proteins for which

274

there is evidence for ubiquitylation and regulated proteolysis (Swaney et al., 2013). For the vast

275

majority of codons in the remaining proteins, there were no significant changes between their

276

actual and expected frequencies in the cell cycle, based on gene-specific codon usage (Tumu

277

et al., 2012). Only four codons (AGC, UAU, AGG, AAC) were used with statistically significant

278

differences in the cell cycle, but the magnitude of those differences was minimal nonetheless

279

(Figure S6). Overall, despite hints at the transcriptional level (Figure 2) for upregulation of

280

processes associated with protein synthesis in the G1 phase, at least from these population-

281

based experiments, our data argue against any significant cell cycle-dependent changes in the

282

ribosome content (Figure 4B), composition (Figure 4C), or codon usage (Figure S6), suggesting

283

that at the proteome level those changes in RNA levels have been dampened extensively.

284
285

Thiamine biosynthesis and TDP-dependent enzymes in the cell cycle

286

To identify other proteins whose levels could change in the cell cycle but were not identified as

287

such by the computational methods we used, we looked at proteins with the largest change in

288

their levels, regardless of missing values or statistical cutoffs. Remarkably, a group of enzymes

289

involved in thiamine biosynthesis peaked coordinately in abundance late in the cell cycle when

290

the cells reached a cell size of ~65 fL (Figure 5A). These enzymes participate in thiamine

291

diphosphate (TDP) synthesis in the cytoplasm. To validate these results, we queried in the cell

292

cycle the levels of a TAP-tagged version of Thi7p from a commercially available strain collection

293

(Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003), expressed from its endogenous chromosomal location. Thi7p

294

showed the smallest difference (slightly over 2-fold) in abundance during the cell cycle from our

295

mass spectrometry experiments and could provide a good measure to validate our results. Early

296

G1 cells carrying the THI7-TAP allele (the only available THI gene in the TAP-tagged strain

297

collection encoding any of the proteins shown in Figure 5A) were obtained by elutriation and the

298

levels of the corresponding proteins were evaluated by immunoblotting at regular intervals, as

299

the cultures progressed in the cell cycle (Figure 5B). We confirmed by immunoblotting that the

300

abundance of Thi7p was elevated late in the cell cycle (see Figure 5B; compared to the levels of

301

the control protein Pgk1p). These results are consistent with the notion that there might be a

302

coordinate, mitotic upregulation of thiamine biosynthesis enzymes.

303

Next, we asked if any TDP-dependent enzymes also change in abundance in the cell

304

cycle and if strains lacking these proteins have cell cycle-related phenotypes. TDP is a cofactor

305

for several enzymes, including transketolase (Tkl1,2p), α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (Kgd1p),

306

E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pda1p), pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1,5,6p), and

307

phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (Aro10p). Only the levels of Tkl2p, Pdc5p, and Aro10p appeared

308

to be elevated late in the cell cycle (Figure 5C), at the same time as the levels of thiamine

309

biosynthesis enzymes were also raised (Figure 5A).

310

Cell size phenotypes are often used as a proxy for disrupted cell cycle progression with

311

an increased cell size phenotype typically accompanying mitotic defects. Of all deletion strains

312

lacking a protein that requires TDP as a cofactor, only the loss of Tkl2p increased cell size

313

significantly (Figure 5D). We found that both birth size and the mean size of tkl2Δ cells were

314

larger (Figure 5D). Note that the tkl2Δ deletion strain was not in the panels that were examined

315

in genome-wide screens of cell size mutants (Jorgensen et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002). The

316

mitotic upregulation in the levels of thiamine biosynthesis enzymes (Figure 5A) and Tkl2p itself

317

(Figure 5C) are suggestive of possible mitotic roles for Tkl2p, which might depend on the

318

available TDP pools in the cell. In the Discussion, we speculate on such putative roles, based

319

on the published reports.

320
321

Cell cycle-dependent changes in metabolites and lipids

322

From the same elutriated pools we used to measure RNAs and proteins (see Figure 1), we also

323

measured metabolites and lipids. The assays were performed at the West Coast Metabolomics

324

Center at UC Davis, an NIH RCMRC (Regional Comprehensive Metabolomics Resource Core).

325

Each class of metabolites was measured with distinct mass spectrometry-based assays (see

326

Materials and Methods). From these assays, thousands of compounds were detected, but most

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.17.880252; this version posted December 18, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint

327

could not be assigned confidently to known metabolites, and they were not considered further.

328

Instead, we focused on the 406 primary metabolites, biogenic amines, and complex lipids that

329

were identified across the cell size series. As with our analysis of RNAs and proteins, we used

330

ANOVA (see Table S1 and Figure 6) to identify compounds whose levels change in the cell

331

cycle. Previous reports showed that storage carbohydrates are mobilized at the G1/S transition

332

(Ewald et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). Consistent with these studies, we also found that

333

trehalose levels rise in G1 to their highest levels when cell size reaches 50 fL, but drop

334

significantly at the G1/S transition (Figure 6). By far, however, the class of metabolites that

335

changed the most in abundance in the cell cycle was complex lipids, which peaked late in the

336

cell cycle (Figure 6). These included phospholipids (phosphatidyl-inositol (PI), -ethanolamine

337

(PE), -serine (PS)) and triglycerides (Figure 6). The higher triglyceride levels are also consistent

338

with the elevated levels of neutral lipid droplets late in the G2/M phase, as reported previously

339

(Blank et al., 2017). Overall, the coordinate increase in the levels of ergosterol biosynthesis

340

enzymes we identified from the proteomic analysis (Figure 3A) and the increase in lipids (Figure

341

6), strongly suggest that lipid metabolism is significantly upregulated late in the cell cycle. In the

342

Discussion, we will expand on the significance of these results.

343

DISCUSSION

344

The sample-matched datasets for RNAs, proteins, metabolites, and lipids we generated from

345

budding yeast cells progressing synchronously in the cell cycle provide a comprehensive view

346

of these biomolecules in dividing cells. We discuss our findings in the context of the relation

347

between the transcriptome and the proteome and the integration of metabolite and lipid

348

measurements with other ‘omic’ datasets.

349

In yeast, the latest meta-analyses from all available studies estimated that between 37%

350

and 56% of the variance in protein abundance is explained by mRNA abundance (Ho et al.,

351

2018). These estimates are within the range of previous ones from multiple species (Vogel and

352

Marcotte, 2012). Based on the absolute quantification of protein and mRNA abundances

353

(Lahtvee et al., 2017), the overall correlation between mRNA and protein abundances was also

354

in that range (R2=0.45, based on Pearson’s correlation coefficient). The level of correlation

355

between the transcriptome and the proteome we observed appears to be somewhat higher

356

(ρ=0.52-0.63, based on Spearman’s coefficient), probably because our experiments were done

357

from synchronous cells, and because cell cycle transitions are associated with transcriptional

358

waves (Spellman et al., 1998). A critical role for transcription in shaping the proteome takes

359

place as cells transition in different environments, and during such transitions changes in protein

360

levels were much more highly correlated with the changes in mRNA levels (R2>0.9) (Lahtvee et

361

al., 2017). Hence, the relatively high correlation we observed between the transcriptome and the

362

proteome in the cell cycle is not surprising, and it is probably an underestimate, since some

363

extremely unstable cell cycle regulators whose levels rise as a result of transcription (e.g.,

364

cyclins, see Figure 1C), were absent from our proteomic datasets because of their low

365

abundance.

366
367

Despite the correlation between the transcriptome and the proteome we discussed
above, there were clear groups of transcripts and proteins whose abundance was incongruent.

368

Ribosomal biosynthesis, reflected on the levels of individual ribosomal proteins or assembled

369

ribosomes, was not periodic at the proteomic level (Figures 4 and S5), despite a large G1

370

transcriptional wave of RNAs involved in this process (Figure 2). We noted that a similar

371

phenomenon was recently reported for the integrated stress response, a well-characterized

372

transcriptional response in yeast involving ~900 transcripts (Gasch et al., 2000), which was not

373

seen at all at the protein level (Ho et al., 2018). The observation that the ribosome content of the

374

cell is constant in the cell cycle (Figure 4) suggests that changes in translational efficiency of

375

some mRNAs described previously (Blank et al., 2017) are likely due to transcript-specific

376

mechanisms, rather than global changes in the steady-state ribosome content (Lodish, 1974).

377

The mitotic peak in the levels of TDP biosynthesis enzymes was surprising (Figure 5).

378

The physiological significance of such a change in the levels of these enzymes is unclear.

379

Through some uncharacterized roles, the TDP-dependent transketolase activity is necessary for

380

meiotic progression in mouse oocytes (Kim et al., 2012). In bacteria, transketolase participates

381

in chromosomal topology, and E.coli cells lacking transketolase are UV-sensitive (Hardy and

382

Cozzarelli, 2005). However, we found that yeast tkl2Δ cells are not sensitive to UV or other

383

DNA-damaging agents (not shown). Overall, despite the intriguing observations that late in the

384

cell cycle, levels of the TDP-dependent Tkl2p transketolase were higher (Figure 5C) and loss of

385

Tkl2p increased cell size (Figure 5D), the molecular mechanism connecting these observations

386

remains to be determined.

387

The coordinate upregulation of ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes late in the yeast cell

388

cycle (Figure 3), not evident at the RNA level (Figure 2), was unexpected. To our knowledge,

389

there is no prior report of such a response. It should be noted that the lack of cell cycle-

390

dependent changes at the levels of mRNAs encoding the enzymes of ergosterol biosynthetis

391

was seen not only in our dataset, but also in the other datasets aggregated in the Cyclebase 3.0

392

database for yeast and other organisms (Santos et al., 2015). Of the enzymes we show in

393

Figure 3A, only ERG3 had a rank score of 624, while all others were not periodic (scores >800)

394

(Santos et al., 2015). Note that we also found ERG3 mRNA levels to significantly change in the

395

cell cycle (see File4/Sheet: ‘rnas_anova_heatmap’).

396

The mitotic rise in the levels of sterol biosynthetic enzymes is significant in the context of

397

our metabolite measurements, showing that lipid levels (especially phospholipids and

398

triglycerides) increased at the same time (Figure 6). Our observations are consistent with

399

several other reports linking lipid metabolism with cell cycle progression and mitotic entry in

400

yeast (Anastasia et al., 2012; McCusker and Kellogg, 2012). Levels of triglycerides increase in

401

wild‐type cells synchronized in mitosis (Blank et al., 2017), storage of triglycerides in lipid

402

droplets is thought to fuel mitotic exit (Yang et al., 2016), and lipid-exchange proteins integrate

403

lipid signaling with cell-cycle progression (Huang et al., 2018). Note that there have not been

404

analytical measurements of distinct lipids in the cell cycle in yeast. The data we show here are

405

not only consistent with, but also significantly expand the prior studies mentioned above. It is

406

also important to stress that an increase in lipids late in the cell cycle cannot simply be due to a

407

need for cell surface material. We had shown previously that increased lipogenesis does not

408

increase cell size (Blank et al., 2017). Hence, the increase in the abundance of lipids likely

409

reflects changes in the composition of membranes or other more specialized, cell cycle-

410

dependent process, not necessarily a simplistic need for more cell surface building blocks.

411

One also needs to consider the dramatic changes in cellular morphology. Especially

412

during mitosis, when the cell adopts the characteristic hourglass structure. The lipid content

413

must accommodate dynamic changes in membrane curvature. For example, during cytokinesis,

414

it is thought that lipids that confer negative curvature must be deposited on the outer leaflet of

415

the bilayer (Furse and Shearman, 2018). In yeast and human cells, inhibition of de novo fatty

416

acid biosynthesis arrests cells in mitosis (Hasslacher et al., 1993; Schneiter et al., 1996; Al-Feel

417

et al., 2003; Scaglia et al., 2014). In human cells, cholesterol synthesis may affect multiple

418

points in the cell cycle. In an earlier report, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis arrested human

419

cells in mitosis (Suarez et al., 2002), while in a later report the cells arrested in G1 (Singh et al.,

420

2013). Cholesterol’s role in mitosis appears to be complex, not only affecting the distribution of

421

phospholipids in the plasma membrane but also governing the formation of a vesicular network

422

at the midbody during cytokinesis (Kettle et al., 2015). Interestingly, ergosterol may have a cell

423

cycle regulatory role in yeast, distinct from its bulk, structural role in membrane integrity (Dahl et

424

al., 1987), but that role remains unclear (Gaber et al., 1989). Lastly, our results argue for post-

425

transcriptional mechanisms leading to mitotic upregulation of sterol biosynthesis. As to how the

426

differential abundance of the ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes might come about, we note that

427

all the enzymes we show in Figure 3A, including Erg3p, have been shown to be

428

ubiquitinylated (Peng et al., 2003; Swaney et al., 2013), raising the possibility of regulated

429

proteolysis.

430

Overall, our data underscore the value of having metabolite measurements along with

431

other ‘omic’ datasets, to strengthen the efforts of identifying physiologically relevant cellular

432

responses. In future work, employing targeted metabolic profiling and flux analysis in the cell

433

cycle will increase our understanding of how the transcriptome and proteome shape dynamic

434

changes in metabolism and how resources are allocated during cell division.

466

All the strains used in this study are shown in the Key Resources Table, above. Unless noted

467

otherwise, the cells were cultivated in the standard, rich, undefined medium YPD (1% w/v yeast

468

extract, 2% w/v peptone, 2% w/v dextrose), at 30 °C (Kaiser et al., 1994).

469
470

Elutriation

471

To collect enough cells for the downstream measurements of RNA, proteins, and metabolites,

472

we followed the same strategy we described previously (Blank et al., 2017). Briefly, elutriated

473

wild type, G1 cells (diploid BY4743 background) were allowed to progress in the cell cycle until

474

they reached the desired cell size. At that point, they were quenched (with 100 µg/ml

475

cycloheximide and 0.1% sodium azide) and frozen away, and later pooled with cells of similar

476

size (Figure 1A). Overall, we had to collect 101 individual samples, to generate the 24 pools

477

shown in Figure 1A.

478

For other elutriation experiments (e.g., see Figures 4,5), only an early G1 elutriated

479

fraction was collected, from which samples were taken at regular intervals as the cells

480

progressed in the cell cycle.

481
482

Cell size and DNA content measurements

483

The methods to measure DNA content and the cell size (birth or mean size) of asynchronous

484

cultures and estimate the critical size of asynchronous cultures, have been described in detail

485

previously (Guo et al., 2004; Truong et al., 2013; Soma et al., 2014; Maitra et al., 2019).

487

Proteomic samples

488

We used ~1E+09 cells from each of the 24 pools of the cell size series (see Figure 1) to prepare

489

extracts for LC-MS/MS. For each sample, the cells were resuspended in 0.75 ml of lysis solution

490

(10 mM Tris pH 7.8, 10 mM NaCl). Glass beads were added to the top of liquid level, the

491

samples were placed in a Mini Beadbeater (Biospec), and the cells broken by ‘bead-beating’

492

twice at the maximum speed for 90 s each time, placed on ice for 60 s between. The extract

493

from each sample was collected by punching a hole with a 21-gauge syringe needle at the

494

bottom of the tube. Lastly, the soluble material from the lysates were clarified by centrifugation

495

at 14,000 g at 4 °C, for 10 m. Insoluble pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer and

496

both clarified supernatants and pellets were stored at -80 °C until processing for mass

497

spectrometry.

498

For mass spectral analysis, clarified extracts were thawed and protease inhibitors

499

immediately added. 50 μl of each supernatant sample was mixed with 50 µl trifluoroethanol

500

(TFE) and reduced with 5mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at 56 °C for 45 m, cooled

501

for 5 m at room temperature, and alkylated with 25 mM iodoacetamide in the dark, at room

502

temperature for 30 m. Samples were diluted 10-fold with digestion buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2

503

mM calcium chloride), digested with trypsin (added at 1:50 ratio) at 37 °C for 5 h. Digestion was

504

stopped with 100 µl of 10% formic acid and sample volumes were reduced to 100-250 μl in a

505

SpeedVac. Following filtration with an Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit the peptides

506

were desalted using C18 Spin Tips, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The volume of

507

the samples was then reduced to 5-10 μl in a SpeedVac. Lastly, the samples were resuspended

508

in 100 μl of a 95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid solution, and subjected to LC-

509

MS/MS analysis.

510

The insoluble pellets from the same extracts described above were processed based on

511

a method reported previously (Lin et al., 2013). The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 2% w/v

512

sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50 mM ammonium carbonate and heated at 95 °C for 10 m.

513

Following clarification each supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, mixed with six volumes

514

of cold acetone (-20 °C), and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h to form a precipitate. Precipitate was

515

recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 15 m, the supernatant carefully removed by

516

aspiration, and the pellets washed twice with 0.4 ml of cold acetone. After each wash the

517

samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 1 m and the supernatant carefully aspirated. Pellets

518

were solubilized in 500 μl of 1% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM ammonium carbonate with

519

two rounds of sonication (10 m each) in a water bath sonicator with 5 m on ice in between. 50 µl

520

of each sample was reduced and alkylated with TCEP and iodocateamide as described above.

521

Unreacted iodoacetamide was quenched with 12 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The samples were

522

brought to 80 µl with digestion buffer and digested with trypsin (added at 1:50 ratio) at 37 °C for

523

5 h. Digestion was stopped with 1% formic acid and samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g for

524

10 m to pellet the precipitated sodium deoxycholate. Peptides were desalted with C18 Spin

525

Tips, and resuspended for LC-MS/MS as described above.

526
527

LC-MS/MS

528

Mass spectra were acquired on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion. 5 µl (supernatant samples) or 2 µl

529

(pellet samples) of peptides were separated using reverse phase chromatography on a Dionex

530

Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific) with a C18 trap to Acclaim C18

531

PepMap RSLC column (Dionex; Thermo Scientific) configuration. Peptides were eluted using a

532

3-45% acetonitrile gradient over 70 min and directly injected into the mass spectrometer using

533

nano-electrospray. Data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry was performed using a top

534

speed HCD method with full precursor ion scans (MS1) collected at 120,000 m/z resolution and

535

a cycle time of 3 sec. Monoisotopic precursor selection and charge-state screening were

536

enabled, with ions of charge >+1 selected with dynamic exclusion of 30s for ions selected

537

once within a 30s window. Selected precursor ions underwent high-energy collision-induced

538

dissociation (HCD) at 31% energy stepped +/-4%. All MS2 scans were centroid and done in

539

rapid mode. Raw files were processed using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 and the label-free

540

quantification workflow.

541
542

RNA samples and libraries

543

We used the same approach we had described previously (Blank et al., 2017), to collect cells

544

from elutriated cultures of wild type (BY4743 strain background). For each of the 24 samples,

545

from ~3E+07 cells total RNA was prepared with the hot phenol method. Briefly, the frozen

546

pellets were re-suspended in 0.4 ml TES buffer (10 mM Tris pH = 7.5, 10mM EDTA, 0.5%

547

SDS), in DEPC-treated water, and ~0.05 ml glass beads were added. Then, 0.4 ml of acid

548

phenol:chloroform was added to each pellet, and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 30 m,

549

and vortexed briefly every 5 m during that time. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 5

550

m, and 0.3 ml of the top, aqueous layer were placed in a 2-ml screw-cap tube containing 1 ml

551

cold ethanol with 40 μl of a 3M sodium acetate solution. The samples were incubated at 4 °C

552

overnight and then centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 m. The pellets were washed with 80% ethanol

553

and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 5 m. The pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 25 μl of

554

DEPC-treated water. For the RNAseq libraries, we also used the same approach we had

555

described (Blank et al., 2017), except that we did not select for polyA-tailed RNAs. Instead, from

556

total RNA, we depleted rRNA, using the ‘Ribo-Zero™ Magnetic Gold Kit (Yeast)’, according to

557

the manufacturer’s instructions. All libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000, with

558

multiplexing, at the Texas A&M AgriLife Genomics and Bioinformatics Facility. Raw sequencing

559

data (fastq files) have been deposited (GEO: GSE135476).

560
561

The reads were aligned to the S. cerevisiae reference genome (version R64-1-1) using
the Rsubread R language package (Liao et al., 2019). First, an index was built using the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.17.880252; this version posted December 18, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint

562

command: buildindex(basename = “R64”, reference = “Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-

563

1.dna.toplevel.fa”, gappedIndex=TRUE). Then, for each of the 24 libraries, the paired end reads

564

were aligned with the command: align(index = ‘R64’, readfile1 = ‘….fastq.gz’, readfile2 =

565

‘….fastq.gz’, type = “rna”). For each library, we obtained >10 million uniquely mapped reads,

566

and the output BAM files were then used in the featureCounts function of the Rsubread

567

package, with the following command: featureCounts(files = “…subread.BAM”, ispairedEnd =

568

TRUE, requireBothEndsMapped = TRUE, annotext = “Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-

569

1.95.gtf”, countChimericFragments = FALSE, isGTFAnnotationFile = TRUE). All the read counts

570

are in File1/sheet ‘rna_reads’.

571

For differential RNA levels between any two points in the cell cycle using the DESeq2 R

572

language package (Love et al., 2014), the raw read data (File2/sheet ‘rna_deseq2_i’) were used

573

as input. For this statistical analysis, the 24 cell size pools were grouped in 8 groups, for each of

574

the approximately 5 fL increments in the cell size series (see Figure 1A). Additional analyses

575

with ANOVA-based methods were performed as for the other biomolecules, and they are

576

described below.

577
578

Metabolite samples and analysis

579

The untargeted, primary metabolite, biogenic amine, and complex lipid analyses were done at

580

the NIH-funded West Coast Metabolomics Center at the University of California at Davis,

581

according to their mass spectrometry protocols. Gas Chromatography–Time-of-Flight Mass

582

Spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) was used for Primary metabolites. For biogenic amines, separation

583

and detections was achieved by Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC), followed by

584

Quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) MS/MS. Lastly, for complex lipids, Charged Surface Hybrid

585

(CSH™) C18 separation was followed with QTOF MS/MS for lipids. Extract preparation was

586

also done at the same facility, from 1E+07 cells in each sample, from the same ones used for

587

proteomic and RNA profiling (Figure 1). The cells were provided to the Metabolomics facility as

588

frozen (at -80 °C) pellets. Detected species that could not be assigned to any compound were

589

excluded from the analysis.

590
591

ANOVA-based computational approaches to identify differentially expressed

592

biomolecules

593

For RNA samples, we used the TPM normalized values. For all other biomolecules, the input

594

values we used were scaled-normalized for input values per sample. All the input and output

595

datasets are shown in Table S1. To identify significant differences in the levels of biomolecules

596

between any two points in the cell cycle we used the robust bootstrap ANOVA, via the t1waybt

597

function, and the posthoc tests via the mcppb20 function, of the WRS2 R language package

598

(Wilcox, 2011). The function is shown in File6, using as an example the ‘File2/sol_pa_anova

599

spreadsheet. For this statistical analysis, the 24 cell size pools were grouped in 8 groups, for

600

each of the approximately 5 fL increments in the cell size series (see Figure 1A).

601
602

SWATH-Mass spectrometry

603

The samples used to measure ribosomal protein abundances were from elutriated, diploid wild

604

type BY4743 cells (see Key Resources Table). Once the cells reached the desired cell size,

605

they were quenched with 100 µg/ml cycloheximide and 0.1% sodium azide. Cells were

606

harvested from three independently elutriated cultures (5E+07 cells in each sample). The cells

607

were re-suspended in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris·Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1

608

mM DTT, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1% v/v Triton X-100, and 25 U/ml Turbo DNase I, to a

609

volume of 0.35 ml. Then, 0.2 ml of 0.5mm glass beads were added to each sample, and

610

vortexed at maximum speed for 15 s, eight times, placing on ice for 15 s in between. The

611

lysates were clarified by centrifuging at 5,000 rpm for 5 m, at 4 °C, and again for 5 m at 13,000

612

rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a 13×51 mm polycarbonate ultracentrifuge

613

tube, underlaid with 0.90 ml of 1 M sucrose, and the ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation

614

in a TLA100.3 rotor (Beckman) at 100,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein pellets from three

615

biological replicates for various time points during the cell cycle (40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 and

616

75 fL) were then re-suspended in PBS, subjected to a Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP)

617

protocol tryptic digestion (Wisniewski et al., 2009), desalted using C-18 Ziptips, and analyzed by

618

data-independent acquisition (DIA)/SWATH-mass spectrometry, as described previously

619

(Schilling et al., 2017).

620

Briefly, samples were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC-ESI-MS/MS using an Eksigent

621

Ultra Plus nano-LC 2D HPLC system (Dublin, CA) with a cHiPLC system (Eksigent) which was

622

directly connected to a quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF) TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer

623

(SCIEX, Concord, CAN) (Christensen et al., 2018). After injection, peptide mixtures were loaded

624

onto a C18 pre-column chip (200 µm x 0.4 mm ChromXP C18-CL chip, 3 µm, 120 Å, SCIEX)

625

and washed at 2 µl/min for 10 min with the loading solvent (H2O/0.1% formic acid) for desalting.

626

Subsequently, peptides were transferred to the 75 µm x 15 cm ChromXP C18-CL chip, 3 µm,

627

120 Å, (SCIEX), and eluted at a flow rate of 300 nL/min with a 3 h gradient using aqueous and

628

acetonitrile solvent buffers.

629

For quantification, all peptide samples were analyzed by data-independent acquisition

630

(Gillet et al., 2012), using 64 variable-width isolation windows (Collins et al., 2017; Schilling et

631

al., 2017). The variable window width is adjusted according to the complexity of the typical MS1

632

ion current observed within a certain m/z range using a DIA ‘variable window method’ algorithm

633

(more narrow windows were chosen in ‘busy’ m/z ranges, wide windows in m/z ranges with few

634

eluting precursor ions). DIA acquisitions produce complex MS/MS spectra, which are a

635

composite of all the analytes within each selected Q1 m/z window. The DIA cycle time of 3.2 s

636

included a 250 ms precursor ion scan followed by 45 ms accumulation time for each of the 64

637

variable SWATH segments.

638

The DIA/SWATH data was processed with the Spectronaut™ software platform

639

(Biognosys) for relative quantification comparing peptide peak areas among different time points

640

during the cell cycle. For the DIA/SWATH MS2 data sets quantification was based on XICs of 6-

641

10 MS/MS fragment ions, typically y- and b-ions, matching to specific peptides present in the

642

spectral libraries. Significantly changed proteins were accepted at a 5% FDR (q-value < 0.05).

643
644

Immunoblot analysis

645

For protein surveillance, protein extracts were made as described previously (Amberg et al.,

646

2006), and run on 4-12% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gels. To detect TAP-tagged proteins with the

647

PAP reagent, we used immunoblots from extracts of the indicated strains as we described

648

previously (Blank et al., 2017). Loading was evaluated with an anti-Pgk1p antibody.

649
650

Comparison of the relative protein abundances in (Becher et al., 2018) and (Olsen et al.,

651

2010)

652

For the datasets generated in human, HeLa cells, 0.5 h after nocodazole arrest, the data were

653

from Table S1 in (Becher et al., 2018) and Supplementary Table_S1 in (Olsen et al., 2010). In

654

the former study the authors reported the Log2-transformed ratios of the measured abundance

655

over the median abundance of asynchronous cultures. For the (Olsen et al., 2010) proteins, the

656

data were the isotopic ratios reported. In both cases, these values represented the

657

corresponding protein abundances in that sample, among all the proteins identified in each

658

sample in each study (see File7). To compare the rank order of the 3,298 proteins identified in

FIGURE 1. Overview of the experimental design to query cell cycle-dependent changes in
the levels of RNAs, proteins, and metabolites. A, Generation of sample-matched, multiomic
datasets from synchronous cultures of cells of different size, during the cell cycle. B, Serving as
s
a morphological marker of cell cycle progression, the percentage of budded cells (y-axis) as a
function of cell size (x-axis) is shown for each cell size pool. Cell size corresponds to the mean
cell size of the population, and in this case it is the weighted average of all the mean cell sizes
of all the elutriated samples that constituted each of the 24 pools. C, The levels of mitotic
(CLB2) or G1 (CLN1,2) cyclin mRNAs, which are known to be periodic in the cell cycle, are
shown along with those of a non-periodic transcript (ACT1; encoding actin). Cell size is shown
on the x-axis (in fL), while the Log2-transformed ‘Transcripts Per Kilobase Million’ (TPM) values
s
for each transcript are shown on the y-axis. All 24 values, one for each pool, were plotted in
these graphs. Loess curves and confidence bands indicating the standard errors on the curve at

FIGURE 2. Transcripts changing in abundance in the cell cycle. Heatmap of the levels of
652 differentially expressed RNAs with significantly different levels (p<0.05; Log2(FC)≥1)
between any two points in the cell cycle, based on bootstrap ANOVA. The levels of each RNA
were the average of each triplicate for the cell size indicated, which was then divided by the
average value of the entire cell size series for that RNA. These ‘expressed ratios’ were then
Log2-transformed. The Log2(expressed ratios) values were hierarchically clustered and
displayed with the pheatmap R language package, using the default unsupervised algorithms of
the package. The different rows of the heatmap correspond to the different cell sizes (40-75 fL,
top to bottom, in 5fL intervals). The cell cycle phases approximately corresponding to these
sizes are shown to the right of the heatmap. The names of all RNAs, values, and clustering
classifications are in File4/Sheet: ‘rnas_anova_heatmap’. The gene ontology enrichment
analysis for each cluster was done on the PANTHER platform, and the detailed output is in
File4/Sheet: ‘rnas_clusters’.

A, Elutriated, early G1 cells were cultured, and sampled at regular intervals in the cell cycle, in
three biological replicates at each 5fL range, from 40 to 75 fL. Protein extracts from the same
number of cells were then fractionated by sucrose ultra-centrifugation, to isolated ribosomes on
mRNAs, which were then analyzed by SWATH-mass spectrometry (see materials and
Methods). B, The peak areas corresponding to each ribosomal protein (RP) detected were

The levels of each ribosomal protein (see Figure 4) detected were normalized against the sum
of all ribosomal proteins detected in that sample, and displayed as Log2-transformed expressed
ratios (y-axis), while cell size (in fL) is on the x-axis. In none of the few cases (e.g.,
Rps8,9,26,27,28p; Rpl14,17Ap) where the abundance of the ribosomal protein in question
appeared to fluctuate somewhat in the cell cycle the changes were periodic (FDR>0.05), and
these changes likely reflect experimental error in the quantification.

FIGURE S6. Little, if any, evidence for cell cycle-dependent changes in codon usage.
From the 333 cell cycle-regulated proteins shown in Figure 3, we selected the ones who were
not identified as ubiquitylated by (Swaney et al., 2013), and whose corresponding mRNA levels
were not changing (from Figure 2). These proteins were further grouped according to their cell
cycle expression pattern (peaking in G1: in clusters 1&2 (n=29); peaking in S: in clusters 3&4
(n=24): peaking in G1/M: in cluster 5 (n=29); peaking in G2/M: in clusters 6&7 (n=90)). For each
h
codon in each mRNA encoding each of these proteins, we obtained the ratio of the actual to
expected usage, based on (Tumu et al., 2012). These values are displayed as violin plots, for
the four codons shown that there were statistically significant differences between the groups for
or
each codon (based on bootstrapped ANOVA: p<0.05). For differences between groups in each
codon, the p-values shown were obtained from posthoc statistical tests, using the mcppb20
function of the WRS2 R language package. The red horizontal lines indicate equal
actual:expected codon usage in each case.
