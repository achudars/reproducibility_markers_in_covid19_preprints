ABSTRACT

24

Despite the ubiquity of parental effects and their potential impact on evolutionary dynamics,

25

their contribution to the evolution of ecologically relevant adaptations remains poorly

26

understood. Using quantitative genetics, here we demonstrate that parental effects contribute

27

substantially to the evolutionary potential of larval antipredator responses in a leaf beetle

28

(Leptinotarsa decemlineata). Previous research showed that larger L. decemlineata larvae elicit

29

stronger antipredator responses, and mothers perceiving predators improved offspring responses

30

by increasing intraclutch cannibalism –an extreme form of offspring provisioning. We now

31

report substantial additive genetic variation underlying maternal ability to induce intraclutch

32

cannibalism, indicating the potential of this adaptive maternal effect to evolve by natural

33

selection. We also show that paternal size, a heritable trait, impacted larval responses to

34

predation risk, but that larval responses themselves had little additive genetic variation. Together,

35

these results demonstrate how larval responses to predation risk can evolve via two types of

36

parental effects, both of which provide indirect sources of genetic variation for offspring traits.

1. INTRODUCTION

46

Parental effects, which are widespread in animals and plants, provide an important source of

47

variation in offspring phenotype and fitness complementing that due to the direct inheritance of

48

genes (Lande and Kirkpatrick 1990; Mousseau and Fox 1998; Wolf et al. 1998; Räsänen and

49

Kruuk 2007). From the provisioning of parental care to the transfer of hormones and antibodies

50

to young, parents alter the phenotype of their offspring, sometimes in an adaptive manner.

51

Indeed, parental effects have been recognized as an important component of phenotypic variation

52

that may facilitate rapid evolutionary responses to a number of ecological stressors (Mousseau

53

and Fox 1998; Räsänen and Kruuk 2007; Donelson et al. 2018). Yet, predictions on the

54

evolutionary consequences of parental effects are complicated by the fact that parental effects

55

may be themselves shaped by the environmental conditions that parents experience, by genetic

56

differences among parents, and by the interaction of these two (McAdam et al. 2014). While

57

environmental and genetic influences in the parental generation should strongly impact

58

evolutionary dynamics –increasing vs. decreasing trait response to selection–, little empirical

59

work to date has partitioned their contribution to variation in offspring traits (reviewed in

60

Räsänen & Kruuk 2007), especially those involving responses to natural ecological stressors.

61
62

Quantitative assessments of parental effects were initially included in quantitative genetic studies

63

with the sole purpose of controlling for non-genetic sources of variation in offspring (Falconer

64

and Mackay 1996; Lynch and Walsh 1998; Futuyma 2009). Nonetheless, it is now recognize that

65

these effects often reflect genetic differences among parents, and therefore can evolve in

66

response to selective forces occurring in both the parental and the offspring generation (Räsänen

67

and Kruuk 2007). Importantly, genetic variation in parental effects provides an additional source

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/748251; this version posted August 28, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

68

of genetic variation that would facilitate evolution of offspring traits that hold little additive

69

genetic variation (Räsänen and Kruuk 2007).

70
71

Parental effects on offspring often reflect environmental hardships that the parents experienced,

72

including limited food, extreme weather, and a high risk of predation (Mousseau and Dingle

73

1991; Mousseau and Fox 1998). The triggering of environmental parental effects may reflect a

74

passive consequence of stress or the resource environment that parents experience, or may

75

involve adaptive responses counter to those conditions. Research over the last two decades

76

indicates that parental effects can function as a form of adaptive transgenerational plasticity –

77

commonly referred as “anticipatory parental effects” (Wade 1998; Agrawal et al. 1999;

78

Galloway and Etterson 2007; Marshall and Uller 2007; Love and Williams 2008; Sheriff and

79

Love 2013). Here, parents improve their offspring’s fitness by matching the offspring’s

80

phenotype to environmental challenges they will likely experience (e.g. Marshall & Uller 2007;

81

Sheriff & Love 2013). Despite growing evidence on the adaptive nature of parental effects on

82

offspring (Agrawal et al. 1999; Sheriff et al. 2010; Storm and Lima 2010; Jensen et al. 2014),

83

evidence of genetic variation in anticipatory parental effects (i.e. maternal genotype by

84

environment interaction) is scarce in both animals (but see Fox et al. 1999) and plants (Galloway

85

2005). As a consequence, support for the evolutionary potential of anticipatory parental effects is

86

to date limited (reviewed in Wade 1998; Räsänen and Kruuk 2007; McAdam et al. 2014).

87
88

Parental effects have been found to be important determinants of traits associated with predator

89

avoidance in a number of species. For example, in a recent study in a leaf beetle (Leptinotarsa

90

decemlineata), we demonstrated that variation in larval responses to predation risk was partially

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/748251; this version posted August 28, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

91

determined by an anticipatory parental effect. When experiencing predation risk, larger

92

hatchlings were found to elicit stronger antipredator responses –measured as greater feeding

93

reductions in the presence of predators. Remarkably, mothers increased offspring provisioning

94

by inducing egg cannibalism within their clutches after detecting a high risk of predation. As a

95

consequence, cannibalistic offspring –being larger and in better nutritional condition than their

96

non-cannibal siblings– exhibited stronger responses to predation risk (Tigreros et al. 2017).

97
98

Here, we use classic quantitative genetics to examine the relative importance of parental effects

99

for traits associated to predator avoidance in L. decemlineata larvae, including decreased

100

foraging activity (leaf consumption) and increased assimilation efficiency. Specifically, we first

101

estimate the contributions of maternal effects (VM), relative to that of additive genetic (VA) and

102

environmental effects (VE), for larval responses to predation risk. Second, we test if larval

103

responses to predation risk –which are known to depend on the larva’s initial size–, are

104

influenced by variation in maternal or paternal body size, a key trait known to impact offspring

105

phenotype in many systems (Fox 1994; Bernardo 1996a; Fox and Czesak 2000; Bennett and

106

Murray 2014). Finally, we estimate the relative contribution of additive genetic and

107

environmental variances (VA and VE) of maternal responses to predation risk, including changes

108

in intraclutch cannibalism –a mechanism linked to an anticipatory maternal effect.

109

2. METHODS
110

(a) Breeding design

111

To estimate the relative contribution of parental effects to larval responses to predation risk we

112

used a half-sib design (Falconer and Mackay 1996) (see Fig. 1). The experiment was initiated

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/748251; this version posted August 28, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

113

with 25 females collected from a field population in Ithaca, NY, which were allowed to lay eggs

114

in the laboratory; their offspring, once mature, were considered the “parental generation” (Figure

115

1) from which sires and dams were selected. All sires, dams, and offspring from the different

116

sire by dam crosses were reared separately from birth –which minimizes common environmental

117

effects– and were maintained in standardized conditions, fed with Solanum tuberosum L (Yukon

118

Gold variety) with 18-L : 6-D photoperiod and corresponding temperatures of 23 : 21 °C. The

119

half-sib families were initially established with 22 males (sires) each randomly mated to three

120

unrelated females (dams). Sires that failed to inseminate at least two females were excluded and

121

final analyses included fewer sires and dams, which is specified in each section below.

Fig. 1 Diagram of L. decemlineata half-sib split-brood design showing one sire family. Nineteen
sires were each mated to three virgin females (dams). The offspring of these three dams were used
to investigate parental effects on plastic responses to predation risk: predator-free (P-Free) vs.
predation risk (P-Risk). First, we examined the overall contribution of maternal effects (VM),
relative to the additive genetic and environmental components (VA and VE), to larval anti-predator
responses: feeding reductions and increases in assimilation efficiency. Second, we compared how
paternal and maternal body size influenced such larval responses to predation risk. Finally, using
adult-mated-females, (from Clutch 2), we examined if there was additive genetic variation (VA)
underpinning maternal response to predation risk. Maternal responses included changes in clutch
size, proportion of viable offspring, and levels of intraclutch cannibalism; the last of these
(increases in intraclutch cannibalism), is known to act as an adaptive maternal effect by improving
larval anti-predator responses (Tigreros et al. 2017).

123
124

(b) Maternal effects on larval responses to predation risk

125

In a first step, we followed a variance partitioning strategy to quantify the amount of variance in

126

offspring’s traits –larval leaf consumption and assimilation efficiency– that is explained by

127

maternal identity (VM), while accounting for the contributions of additive genetic inheritance

128

(VA) and environmental variances (VE) (McAdam et al. 2014). Final analysis included 19 sires

129

mated to 47 dams (with varying numbers of dams per sire). We estimated larval plastic responses

130

to predation risk by measuring changes in larval feeding (leaf consumption) and assimilation

131

efficiency in response to predation risk. To do this, six eggs from each maternal family (within

132

the same clutch) were separated right before hatching and kept in individual 266 ml cups, which

133

prevented intraclutch cannibalism and its influences on larval responses (Tigreros et al. 2017).

134

Additionally, to control for potential effects due to hatching asynchrony within and among

135

families, we recorded variation in egg pigment levels, Low, Medium, and High, as described in

136

Tigreros et al. (2017).

137
138

Hatchlings from half of each maternal family were kept with a sham predator (“predation risk”

139

environment), while the remaining siblings were kept without it, hence experiencing a “predator-

140

free” environment (Fig. 1). Sham predators consisted of adult male Podisus maculiventris –a

141

generalist stink bug that commonly feeds on L. decemlineata larvae– whose stylet’s terminal

142

segment had been removed. While these altered stink bugs are no longer able to kill the beetle

143

larvae, previous studies have shown that their behaviour and lifespan do not significantly differ

144

from that of unaltered predators (Griffin and Thaler 2006; Thaler et al. 2012; Kaplan et al. 2014).

145

Larvae were kept in the predator-free and predation risk environments for a total of three days

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/748251; this version posted August 28, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

146

(4- day old larvae). Then, we measured leaf consumption as consumed leaf area (mm2) using

147

ImageJ software (version 1.45), and assimilation efficiency as the ratio of 4-d old larval mass

148

(measured to the nearest 0.1mg using a Mettler AT261 balance; Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH,

149

USA) over amount of leaf consumed.

150
151

Statistical analysis, of maternal effects on larval responses to predation risk, involved the use of

152

linear mixed models with maximum likelihood estimation. For each trait –leaf consumption and

153

assimilation efficiency–, we included the treatment effect as a fixed factor (predator-free vs.

154

predation risk) while the sire, dam, sire-by-treatment interaction and dam-by-treatment

155

interaction (referred as GxE and MxE) were all included as random factors. Significance of

156

variance components for larval responses to predation risk were estimated using the REML

157

method (Proc MIXED) and likelihood ratio tests (Saxton and SAS Institute. 2004). Evidence of a

158

significant GxE or MxE was investigated in more detail by testing the null hypothesis that

159

genetic correlations of traits associated with plastic responses to predation risk, measured across

160

the predator-free and predation risk environment (rA ) were = 1 (Lynch and Walsh 1998; Messina

161

and Fry 2003). Genetic correlations significantly less than 1 suggest the potential for independent

162

trait evolution in different predation-risk environments and thus would provide additional

163

support for GxE. Additionally, because expression of maternal and additive genetic effects is

164

expected to differ within different environments, we estimated the genetic variance components

165

(VM , VA, VE) and associated genetic parameters (e.g. narrow sense heritabilities and genetic

166

coefficient of variation) for the larval traits within each environment –predator-free and

167

predation risk (Table 1S). Variance components were calculated assuming the dominance

168

variance to be zero: VA = 4sire, VM = dam – sire, and VP = total phenotypic variance (Falconer

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/748251; this version posted August 28, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

169

and Mackay 1996). Narrow sense heritabilities (h2) of traits within a predator environment were

170

then calculated as VA / VP , representing the proportion of the total phenotypic variance

171

explained by the direct genetic variance (Falconer and Mackay 1996).

172
173

c) Parental size effects on larval responses to predation risk

174

In a second step, we followed a trait-based approach (McAdam et al. 2014) to investigate the

175

effects of both maternal and paternal body size on larval plastic responses to predation risk.

176

Here, the effects of specific parental traits, the body size of sires (fathers) and dams (mothers),

177

are modeled. Because our main interest was to investigate effects on larval plastic responses to

178

predation risk (rather than effects on the traits in each environment) we calculated larval plastic

179

responses using Cohen’s D effect size =

180

regression analysis to test for both maternal and paternal size effects (for a similar approach see

181

Bennett and Murray 2014). Given that previous studies have shown that larger hatchlings elicit

182

stronger antipredator responses, we included larval size (averaged for each family) as an

183

additional predictor. Additionally, we analyzed the effects of parental body size on larval

184

responses using a “hybrid approach” (McAdam et al. 2014), which included sire and dam

185

identities (as described in “maternal effects on larval responses to predation risk”) plus maternal

186

(or paternal) body size and its interaction with predation risk treatment as fixed effects (Sizesire x

187

E and Sizedam x E). This approach allow us to model the effects of specific parental traits (here

188

body size) while accounting for the remaining variation in maternal and sire effects (VM and VA).

189

However, these more complex models, especially when unbalanced, may bias estimates of

190

genetic parameters as well as inference for fixed effects (e.g. Kenward and Roger 1997; Stroup

191

and Littell 2002).

and used multiple

192
193

(d) Maternal plastic responses to predation risk

194

In a last experiment, we measured the amount of genetic variance (and associate genetic

195

parameters) underlying maternal responses to predation risk including clutch size, levels of

196

intraclutch cannibalism, and proportion of viable offspring within a clutch (Fig. 1). Note that

197

although intraclutch cannibalism and clutch size may influence progeny phenotype (e.g. progeny

198

size), these are here considered a maternal rather than an offspring trait (see Mousseau & Fox

199

1998). To measure maternal responses to predation risk, two females from each maternal family

200

(and the same clutch) were individually reared to adults and mated with a full sibling. Because

201

males in a number of insects can influence female reproduction (e.g. fecundity), mating full sibs

202

may reduce chances to introduce an additional source of variation to the estimates of additive

203

genetic variance in maternal traits. Importantly, mating full-sibs did not cause any apparent

204

inbreeding effects in female reproduction: clutch size and offspring produced by full-sib pairs

205

were comparable to those observed in females that had mated with unrelated males (see

206

Inbreeding analysis in Supplemental information). After mating, half of the females were each

207

kept with two sham predators (predation risk environment) in a 0.5 L cup, with abundant plant

208

foliage for feeding and oviposition. The rest of females were kept in similar conditions but

209

without the sham predators (predator-free environment). We collected the first two clutches that

210

females laid and stored them individually with a fresh leaflet (in 30 ml cups). Clutch size

211

(number of eggs) and offspring produced were measured in the same clutch while intraclutch

212

cannibalism, the proportion of eggs that were fully consumed by the new hatchlings, were

213

measured on a second clutch (Collie et al. 2013; Tigreros et al. 2017).

215

The statistical approach to examine maternal responses to predation risk was similar to that used

216

for larval responses to predation risk but, because each dam included only one daughter per

217

treatment, maternal effects on maternal responses to predation risk (VM x E) cannot be estimated.

218

Final analysis of maternal responses to predation risk included 15 sires mated to 32.

219

Additionally, to estimate variance components for levels of intraclutch cannibalism we used a

220

generalized linear model using LAPLACE method (Proc GLIMMIX), which captured the

221

binomial distribution of intraclutch cannibalism using a logit link function (Saxton and SAS

222

Institute. 2004). Because the residual variance estimates of this type of model is correlated with

223

the mean of the population, we estimated heritability as “latent-scale heritability”, by adding the

224

variance component related to the link function (Nakagawa and Schielzeth 2010; Calsbeek et al.

225

2015), which for binomial models is =

226

(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4

3. RESULTS

229

(a) Maternal effects on larval responses to predation risk

230

Larval plastic responses to predation risk were substantial, involving a 22% reduction in leaf

231

consumption (F1,18 =7.53, P = 0.01; Fig. 2A, Table 1A) and a 17% increase in assimilation

232

efficiency (F1,18 =5.43, P = 0.03; Fig. 2B, Table 1 A). Yet, we did not detect a significant

233

interaction between predation risk and sire or dam families influencing the larval traits (Table

234

1A: Sire x Risk and Dam x Risk), which indicates that there was substantial plasticity in larval

235

responses to predation risk, but there was not a detectable genetic or maternal variance

236

underpinning larval responses.

246

Partitioning of variance components of larval traits within each predator environment (predator-

247

free and predation risk environment) showed, as expected, differences in the relative importance

248

of maternal (VM) and additive genetic effects (VA) (Fig. 3; Table 1S). While maternal effects

249

(VM) explained a large proportion of the phenotypic variance in both environments, this was

250

even stronger when in the predation risk environment, explaining over 50% of the variation in

251

leaf consumption and about 30% in assimilation efficiency ( Fig. 3; Table S1 in Supplemental

252

information). In contrast, levels of additive genetic variation (VA) were not statistically

253

significant in either environment (Table S1). Note, however, that the number of sire families in

254

our study was close to the minimum recommended to detect VA (Conner and Hartl 2004) and

255

therefore, finding no additive genetic variance in larval traits could be due to a low statistical

256

power rather than an absolute lack of genetic variance.

257
258

into additive genetic and environmental components. These results revealed a significant additive

Evaluation of parental size effects on larval responses provided similar results using both the

265

trait-based approach of regressing parents’ body size on larval responses– and the hybrid

266

approach of including parent’s body size as covariate plus Sire and Dam identities (McAdam et

267

al. 2014). Regression analyses (controlling offspring size), revealed that paternal body size, but

268

not maternal body size, influenced both the magnitude and direction of larval responses to

269

predation risk including leaf consumption (R2 =0.26: ßsire= -0.51, p= 0.001; ßdam= 0.04, p=

270

0.25; ßlarvae= 0.06, p= 0.4; Fig. 4A), and assimilation efficiency (R2 =0.23: ßsire= 0.48, p=

271

0.003; ßdam=-0.05; p= 0.73; ßlarvae=0.04, p= 0.77; Fig. 4B). Smaller sires producing larvae

272

with the strongest responses (reduced feeding and increased assimilation efficiency). Results

273

from models that included sire and dam identity corroborated the effect of sire size on larval

274

responses (Table S2 in Supplemental information).

potential for independent trait evolution in the different predation environments, providing

301

DISCUSSION

302

Parental effects are important determinants of traits associated with predator avoidance in a

303

number of species. As for all phenotypes, parental effects are shaped by the environment, the

304

genotype, and their interaction. Only by disentangling the relative contribution of such different

305

sources of parental effects –e.g., those owed to the environment vs. the parent’s genes– we can

306

understand their role in organisms’ evolution.

307
308

As observed in previous studies of L. decemlineata (Hermann and Thaler 2014; Kaplan et al.

309

2014; Tigreros et al. 2017, 2018), we found strong plastic responses to predation risk, involving

310

28% reductions in leaf consumption and 15% increases in assimilation efficiency. Coupling of

311

feeding reductions with increased assimilation efficiency is critical to prey fitness, as this allows

312

prey to lower chances of predation while minimizing costs associated with reduced-food intake

313

(Thaler et al. 2012; Kaplan et al. 2014). Based on 19 sires, we found little support of an additive

314

genetic or a maternal component underpinning larval responses to predation risk. However,

315

analyses that included size of the parents as covariates revealed that variation in responses –for

316

both leaf consumption and assimilation efficiency– were at least partially explained by paternal

317

size. Specifically, smaller fathers produced larvae with the greatest plasticity in response to

318

predation risk –strong feeding reductions and increases in assimilation efficiency. Given that

319

females often provide more reproductive investment than males, studies on parental effects often

320

rely on the notion that the maternal phenotype is the main influence on the offspring. However,

321

as we found in this study, male body size can be linked to parental performance (Eilertsen et al.

322

2009), perhaps through changes in the quality of their ejaculates (Gillott 2003), which is known

323

to include accessory glands compounds in L. decemlineata beetles (Loof and Lagasse 1972).

324

Independent of the exact mechanism, because adult body size had a significant additive genetic

325

component, size related paternal effects represented an indirect source of genetic variation

326

shaping larval plastic responses to predation risk.

327
328

Estimates of maternal variance (VM) explained about half of the phenotypic variance in leaf

329

consumption when expressed under high risk of predation. These results are concordant with the

330

notion that the contribution of parental effects, relative to the environmental and additive genetic

331

variance components, is high for traits that are expressed early in life (Bernardo 1996b;

332

Lindholm et al. 2006; Wilson and Reale 2006; White and Wilson 2019) and under environmental

333

stress (e.g. Rudin-Bitterli, Mitchell & Evans 2018).

334
335

In a previous study we demonstrated that larval responses to predation risk (including decreases

336

in leaf consumption) was improved through an anticipatory parental effect: mothers experiencing

337

the risk of predation increased offspring provisioning by inducing intraclutch cannibalism

338

(Tigreros et al. 2017); cannibals, in better nutritional condition than non-cannibal siblings,

339

exhibited stronger antipredator behaviors. Here, we found that mothers indeed responded to

340

predation risk by altering levels of egg cannibalism within their clutches. However, such

341

responses varied in magnitude and direction, with some families increasing and others

342

decreasing cannibalism. In L. decemlineata, intraclutch cannibalism results in a classic life

343

history tradeoff between investment in offspring quality (cannibalistic offspring) and quantity

344

(cannibalized offspring). While fitness of the individual offspring may always improve with

345

cannibalism, optimal levels of cannibalism within a clutch should reflect the number of

346

cannibalistic offspring that would maximize female reproductive success in a given environment

347

(e.g. under predation risk). Finding that families with the highest and lowest levels of intraclutch

348

cannibalism –in the predator-free environment– responded to predation risk by decreasing and

349

increasing cannibalism respectively, suggests that intermediate levels of intraclutch cannibalism

350

may be optimal under environments with high predation risk. Importantly, such variation in

351

maternal responses to predation risk (changes in intraclutch cannibalism and offspring produced)

352

reflected genetic differences among the mothers (significant GxE) indicating the potential for

353

evolutionary change of a maternal effect, in response to predator.

354
355

The conditions under which organisms rely on parental effects vs. within-generation phenotypic

356

plasticity remains an open question in evolutionary ecology. Using plasticity alone, L.

357

decemlineata larvae can achieve substantial feeding reductions (e.g. ~28% in this study) when

358

facing predation risk. However, our previous work indicates that these responses are constrained

359

by the larvae’s nutritional state (Tigreros et al. 2017), and larvae feeding on lower quality host

360

plants have shown weaker feeding reductions in response to predation risk (Kaplan et al. 2014;

361

Tigreros et al. 2017). Through cannibalism, L. decemlineata appears to overcome such

362

nutritional constraints, and cannibals that experience predation risk are capable of reducing leaf

363

consumption, even on low quality host plants. Thus, this extreme type of maternal investment

364

should improve offspring fitness when facing highly stressful environments (Marshall et al.

365

2008; Olofsson et al. 2009).

367

Recent theoretical evidence suggests that evolution of parental effects is promoted when there is

368

strong selection on the phenotype and when within-generation plasticity is constrained (Auld et

369

al. 2010; Kuijper and Hoyle 2015). Predation is unquestionably one of the strongest selective

370

forces in nature, and is therefore thus likely to deplete genetic variation in traits associated with

371

predator avoidance. In contrast, genetic variation underlying paternal and maternal effects is

372

expected to remain “protected” from the eroding effects of selection when carried by the other

373

sex (Wade 1998). Accordingly, results from this study indicate that even if larval responses to

374

predation risk were holding little or no genetic variation, parental effects –via induced intraclutch

375

cannibalism and paternal body size– should provide the necessary genetic variation for future

376

natural selection to act upon (Räsänen and Kruuk 2007). Additionally, because L. decemlineata

377

larval nutritional condition is a function of host plant quality as well as the degree of maternal

378

provisioning, evolution of paternal effects may be favored in environments where larval

379

plasticity is constrained by poor host plant quality. Together, our results show that the

380

evolutionary potential of predator avoidance in L. decemlineata, relies on at least two different

381

genetic parental effects, one linked to paternal body size and the other to maternal induction of

382

intraclutch cannibalism.
