ABSTRACT
Purpose: Metastatic relapse of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) within 2 years of diagnosis is
associated with particularly aggressive disease and a distinct clinical course relative to TNBCs that
relapse beyond 2 years. We hypothesized that rapid relapse TNBCs (rrTNBC; metastatic relapse or
death <2 years) reflect unique genomic features relative to late relapse (lrTNBC; >2 years).
Patients and Methods: We identified 453 primary TNBCs from three publicly-available datasets and
characterized each as rrTNBc, lrTNBC, or ‘no relapse’ (nrTNBC: no relapse/death with at least 5
years follow-up). We compiled primary tumor clinical and multi-omic data, including transcriptome
(n=453), copy number alterations (CNAs; n=317), and mutations in 171 cancer-related genes
(n=317), then calculated published gene expression and immune signatures.
Results: Patients with rrTNBC were higher stage at diagnosis (Chi-square p<0.0001) while lrTNBC
were more likely to be non-basal PAM50 subtype (Chi-square p=0.03). Among 125 expression
signatures, five immune signatures were significantly higher in nrTNBCs while lrTNBC were enriched
for eight estrogen/luminal signatures (all FDR p<0.05). There was no significant difference in tumor
mutation burden or percent genome altered across the groups. Among mutations, only TP53
mutations were significantly more frequent in rrTNBC compared to lrTNBC (Fisher exact FDR
p=0.009). To develop an optimal classifier, we used 77 significant clinical and ‘omic features to
evaluate six modeling approaches encompassing simple, machine learning, and artificial neural
network (ANN). Support vector machine outperformed other models with average receiver-operator
characteristic area under curve >0.75.
Conclusions: We provide a new approach to define TNBCs based on timing of relapse. We identify
distinct clinical and genomic features that can be incorporated into machine learning models to
predict rapid relapse of TNBC.

INTRODUCTION
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype defined by lack of
targetable estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2.1 TNBC accounts for 15%
of breast cancer cases yet is responsible for 35% of breast cancer related deaths.1,2 TNBCs tend to
present with higher grade, large size, and often involve lymph nodes at diagnosis. 3 TNBCs are more
likely to develop distant rather than local recurrence compared to hormone receptor-positive
counterparts and spreads more frequently to lung and brain and less frequently to bone.2,4
Understanding determinants of distant relapse is imperative as the median overall survival after
diagnosis of metastatic disease was historically only 13-17 months2,5 and even among patients with
PD-L1 positive TNBC receiving chemo-immunotherapy remains 25 months.6
The existing TNBC subsets/groupings provide a critical framework for understanding intrinsic
genomic characteristics but are only associated with modest differences in patient survival. Clinically,
we know that the majority of patients diagnosed with TNBC are long-term survivors.1,2,7 Among the
20-30% of TNBCs who develop metastatic disease, a subset have an aggressive phenotype
associated with rapid relapse, therapeutic resistance, and poor prognosis while others have a
relatively late relapse, associated with more indolent or treatment responsive disease.7 To more
accurately understand the differences in patient outcome in TNBC, we sought to investigate TNBCs
defined by timing of outcome: rapid versus late versus no relapse.
Advances in sequencing technology have facilitated comprehensive molecular profiling of breast
cancers, including subsets such as TNBC.8,9 A major challenge for TNBC is inter-tumor
heterogeneity, thought to be an important contributor to therapeutic resistance. A landmark
transcriptional analysis of over 500 primary TNBCs revealed six subtypes of TNBC with distinct
expression profiles.10,11 An integrated genomic analysis of TNBCs presented a unifying theory with
four main TNBC subsets: 1) basal-like, immune-activated; 2) basal-like, immune suppressed; 3)
luminal androgen receptor subtype: non-basal subtype with few CNAs; 4) mesenchymal: genomically

unstable with fibroblast/EMT phenotype.12 In addition, genomic analyses demonstrate high frequency
of TP53 mutation, present in more than 75% of TNBCs, as well as mutations in PIK3CA in
approximately 25% of cases.12-14 TNBCs also reflect widespread copy number alterations, suggesting
that lack of genomic integrity is a key mutational process in TNBC.12-14
Clinical datasets may be limited in size, so accurate predictive modeling is crucial in a disease such
as TNBC that has multiple distinct subsets.15 To be successful, predictive model needs to be able to
learn from a small input and extract high-level, accurate information.15 There is growing
implementation of various machine learning approaches to many areas of research including
molecular subtypes of breast cancer16,17 and pathologic image analyses, such as detection of lymph
node metastases in women with breast cancer.18 Determining the best approach for predictive
modeling depends on size of data set, type of features, and outcome.19
In this study, we identify distinct genomic features among primary TNBCs categorized based on
outcome: rapid (rrTNBC), late (lrTNBC) and no relapse (nrTNBC). Using a comparative modeling
approach, we show that machine learning approaches provides an optimal predictor of rapid relapse
for primary TNBCs.

METHODS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics
Patient-specific data were obtained from TCGA13, METABRIC20,21, and from our published metaanalysis (as described previously).8 These variables included age at diagnosis, grade, stage at
diagnosis, pathologic receptor status (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and
HER2), response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (where available), and distant metastasis-free or
overall survival. Triple-negative breast cancer was defined as being negative for ER, PR, and
HER2.Pathologic receptor status was ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ based on the following definitions: for ER
and PR immunohistochemistry (IHC), 0 was defined as ‘negative’, 2-3 was defined as ‘positive’, and

an IHC of 1 was considered indeterminate. For HER2, a FISH HER2/CEP17 ratio of greater than 2.0
was defined as ‘positive’. Chemotherapy response was categorized as pathologic complete response
(pCR) or residual disease (RD) based on study-reported outcomes.

Genomic Data
For data from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC),
normalized gene expression data, copy number data, and somatic mutation data for 171 cancerrelated genes were obtained from the publicly available European Genome-phenome Archive (IDs
EGAD00010000210 and EGAD0001000021) and associated publications21,22. Copy number
segmented data files were processed using GISTIC2.023. For data from TCGA, breast cancer gene
expression data, GISTIC copy number data, and somatic mutation data were obtained from the
UCSC cancer browser (now XENAbrowser; version 2015-02-24). Gene expression data from
published studies of breast cancer patients prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were compiled as
previously described.8

Gene Expression Signatures, Expression-Based Subtypes, and Inferred Immune Subsets
Given gene expression data from multiple studies and disparate platforms, gene expression data for
all TNBCs for each dataset (METABRIC n=287, TCGA n=160, neoadjuvant dataset n=446) were
extracted and quantile normalized within TNBCs from each study then median centered. Due to
complexities of comparing single gene expression or differential expression across
datasets/platforms/batches, we only evaluated summary expression metrics (e.g. signatures, intrinsic
subtypes, CIBERSORT proportions). Gene expression signatures were compiled from published
studies, as previously described.8 We determined PAM50 intrinsic breast cancer subtype using the
‘Bioclassifier’ package from Parker et al after balancing TNBC data with an equal number of ERpositive cases for each dataset.24 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype was determined

using the TNBCtype tool.10,25 Proportion of infiltrating immune cell subsets were calculated using the
CIBERSORT algorithm.26

Modeling
We compared the performance of a multinomial logistic regression model to Artificial Neural Network
(ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Determinant Analysis
(LDA), and Random Forest (RF). Multinomial logistic regression model is an extension of logistic
regression model that allows for a dependent variable with more than two levels. ANNs are based on
a collection of ‘neurons’ or ‘nodes’ arranged in layers and features are fed from one layer to the next
with each layer extracting different high-level features. The last hidden layer forms a high-level
representation to make a classification decision. The KNN algorithm classifies data points based on
other most similar data points (‘nearest neighbors’). SVM develops an optimal hyper-plane in the
feature space to separate different outcomes. LDA compares the log of the estimated density
function, called the discriminant function, and the class assigned is the one with the highest value of
the discriminant function. RF develops many random decision trees and assigns each new data point
based on majority votes among all decision trees.

To adjust the magnitude of features for optimization algorithms (often used in SVM and ANN),27 all
numerical attributes were normalized. We identified 148 features significantly different between
rrTNBC, lrTNBC, and nrTNBC (nominal p < .05) then used the findCorrelation function in caret R
package28 to remove highly correlated numerical features (correlation > .85) or highly associated
features (Cramer’s V > .5) to avoid high dimensionality, resulting in a final model input using 77
features. To have adequate data to train our models and sufficient testing samples to evaluate model
performance, we partitioned our sample into 70% training set and 30% test set. 10-fold validation was
performed on the 70% training data using caret28 and h2o R packages,29 and models were tested on
the 30% test data.

We tuned each model to optimize performance. We used lasso reduction for multinomial logistic
regression model, and tuned the regularization parameter lambda. The chosen set of lambda is an
equally spaced array of 20 values from 1e-5 to .1. The ANN model was tuned on number of hidden
layers, neurons on each hidden layer, and activation function using h2o.deeplearning function. The
structure we chose were 1 to 3 hidden layers consisting of 5, 10, or 20 neurons on each layer with
either Rectifier or Tanh activation function leading to the final output. We tuned number of nearest
neighbors of the KNN model from 1 to 15 while trying to avoid multiples of 3. Built-in tuning was used
for the LDA, SVM, and RF models. The final optimal model was chosen based on the logloss metric (log(likelihood function)).

Model Performance
To evaluate model performance, we assessed each group as a positive outcome (rrTNBC versus all
others; lrTNBC vs all others; nrTNBC vs all others) using receiver-operator characteristic (ROC)
curves. We used multi_roc function in multiROC30 to compute micro-average area under the curve
(AUC) of three ROC curves to evaluate the overall performance of the models. To avoid sampling
bias, we calculated the average AUC on the 30% test data for 10 independent runs.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.4.1. Contrasts in patient and tumor
characteristics were evaluated using Pearson chi-squared tests. The association of signatures to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy response was evaluated using simple linear regression and t-tests. All
calculations of association were multiple-testing corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure
for false discovery rate. For continuous variables, we calculated p-values comparing rapid vs. late
and relapse vs. no relapse using ANOVA and logistic regression. For count variables (e.g. mutated
versus not) we used Fisher exact test to evaluate relapse vs. not and rapid vs. late relapse. P-values

for CIBERSORT and mutation signatures were evaluated using logistic regression, and for CNAs and
mutations were evaluated using Fisher exact tests. Data visualization was made using ggplot2.31

RESULTS
Defining Rapid versus Late versus No Relapse Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
From three large cohorts with primary breast cancer genomic data – TCGA,13 METABRIC,20,21 and
our prior breast cancer gene expression meta-analysis8 - we identified 893 TNBCs from a total of
4473 breast cancer cases. For our analyses, we included patients with at least 60 months of follow-up
or those with a distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) event prior to our 60-month cutoff, leaving a
total of 453 TNBCs in our evaluable dataset. Of these, 453 had gene expression data, 317 had copy
number data, and 317 had mutation data. (Figure 1A).

We assessed the percentage of total DMFS events each year (Figure 1B). In this dataset, over 20%
of DMFS events occurred within the first two years after diagnosis, categorized as ‘rapid relapse’
(rrTNBC). While most DMFS events occurred within the first five years after diagnosis, 1-3% of
events occurred annually in years 6-10 with sporadic events beyond 10 years (lrTNBC). Our main
goal was to identify differences among TNBCs with clinically distinct outcomes, so we visualized
DMFS for our relapse categorization (Figure 1C) in comparison with DMFS for existing intrinsic
expression-based subtype approaches PAM5024 (Figure 1D) or Lehmann/Pietenpol TNBCtype10
(Figure 1D) within the same cohort. The Lehmann/Pietenpol TNBCtype (log-rank p=0.01) but not
PAM50 was associated with significant differences in DMFS. The strikingly different visualized
outcomes suggested that our relapse categorization does, in fact, identify truly distinct subsets based
on outcome when compared to approaches that focus on intrinsic features.

Patient and Tumor Characteristics

We evaluated the association of clinical, pathologic, and intrinsic expression subtype with rapid vs.
late vs. no relapse status (Table 1). There was no significant difference in age at diagnosis or grade;
however, rrTNBCs were significantly more likely to be higher stage (Chi-square p=1.9e-10). The
majority of patients were basal-like PAM50 subtype (78%); however, lrTNBCs were significantly more
likely to be non-basal (non-basal: rrTNBC 18%, lrTNBC 29%, nrTNBC 20%, Chi-square p=0.03).
Lehmann/Pietenpol TNBC subtype also reflected significant differences across groups (Chi-square
p=0.02), although each subtype was represented within each relapse category: the
immunomodulatory phenotype was highest in nrTNBC (16% rrTNBC, 16% lrTNBC, 24%
nrTNBC),luminal androgen receptor was highest in lrTNBC (9% rrTNBC, 16% lrTNBC, 9% nrTNBC),
and basal-like 2 was highest in rrTNBC (15% rrTNBC, 9% lrTNBC, 6% nrTNBC). A subset of patients
in this cohort (127/453; 28.0%) had data on response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). As
anticipated, those patients with rrTNBC or lrTNBC were significantly more likely to have residual
disease (RD) after neoadjuvuant chemotherapy (93% and 94% RD, respectively), relative to those
with nrTNBC (51% RD; Chi-square p=1.9e-7).

Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Survival in TNBC: Immune and Expression Signatures
Response to NAC is known to be a robust prognostic biomarker in TNBC32 and, in this cohort, RD
after NAC was among the clinicopathologic features most strongly associated with rapid and late
versus no relapse (Table 1). The patients with data on response to NAC all had whole transcriptome
data but no available mutation or copy number data, so we sought to understand expression features
associated with NAC response and DMFS. We calculated a score for 125 published gene expression
signatures and evaluated the association of each signature with NAC response (pathologic complete
response versus RD) by simple linear regression and hazard ratio for each signature using DMFS.
Signatures were grouped by phenotype as previously described8 (n=127 patients; Figure 2A).
Immune signatures were associated with better prognosis and most were also associated with
improved response to NAC. Proliferation signatures tended to be associated with improve*ed

response to NAC, as we have previously described8, yet there was variable association with DMFS.
Estrogen receptor/HER2 signatures were associated with poor response to NAC but better DMFS.
Mesenchymal signatures tended to be associated with worse DMFS without clear association with
response to NAC.

To understand what immune cell types in the tumor microenvironment may be reflected by the
immune signatures, we evaluated the association of three representative signatures from each group
(immune, proliferation, ER/HER2, mesenchymal) with the relative proportion of 22 inferred immune
cell subsets via CIBERSORT (Figure 2B).26 Immune signatures were strongly positively correlated
with anti-tumor immune cell types including M1 macrophages, CD8 T-cells, and memory B-cells (all
Pearson’s r >= 0.3, all p<1.2e-8) and anti-correlated with immune suppressive cell types including M2
macrophages, memory resting CD4 T-cells, resting NK cells, and resting mast cells. ER/HER2
signatures reflected an almost opposite pattern to immune signatures, with positive correlation to
immune suppressive cell types and anti-correlation with anti-tumor immune cell type. Proliferation
signatures had a similar pattern to immune signatures, although less striking, while metabolic
signatures appeared to have a strong correlation specifically with M0 macrophages (all Pearson’s
r>0.27, all p<8.4e-9). As a sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the association of three representative
signatures from each group with 7 immune cell-type specific signatures from MSigDB33,34 (instead of
CIBERSORT) and found similar results (Supplementary Figure 1A).

Expression Signatures in Rapid versus Late versus No Relapse TNBC
To assess pathways and phenotypes associated with rapid vs. late vs. no relapse, a score was
calculated for 125 published gene expression signatures across the entire dataset. Visual observation
of all signatures or only the quarter with the greatest variance did not yield any clear patterns
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Evaluating each signature individually across the three groups revealed
16 signatures that were significantly different (ANOVA FDR p<0.05; Figure 3, Supplementary

Figure 2A-B). Among these, five signatures were immune-related: two from the GeparSixto trial35, an
immune signature from TNBC subtypes,10 and two STAT1 signatures.36,37 All were significantly higher
in nrTNBC than rrTNBC and lrTNBC. Eight of the sixteen significant signatures were related to
estrogen receptor signaling and/or luminal phenotype – all were highest in lrTNBC, lowest in rrTNBC,
and intermediate in nrTNBC. Finally, three signatures did not fall into a specific category and revealed
mixed patterns of association. Most CIBERSORT immune subsets were not statistically significant
(Supplementary Figure 2C), however, neutrophils were significantly higher in rrTNBC (ANOVA FDR
p=0.001) while resting mast cells were significantly lower in lrTNBC (ANOVA FDR p=0.003).

Mutations and Copy Number Alterations
In this cohort, 70% (317/453) of patients had data on single nucleotide variant/mutation data on 171
cancer-related genes and whole genome CNAs.21 Only a small subset of patients (11.7%; 53/453)
had whole exome mutation data so we focused on the 171 cancer-related genes to ensure adequate
statistical power. When evaluating general mutational features, there was no significant difference in
mutations per megabase (ANOVA p=0.64; Figure 4A) nor percent genome altered by copy number
(ANOVA p=0.96; Figure 4B).

We first compared the frequency of alteration for each mutation and cytoband (for CNAs) for relapse
(rrTNBC + lrTNBC) versus nrTNBC (Figure 4C) given low frequency of mutation for most genes.
There were no genes that were significantly different after multiple testing when comparing relapse
versus no relapse but PIK3CA mutations were more frequent in relapse relative to nrTNBC; and
PTEN, ARID1A, and RYR2 mutations enriched in nrTNBC relative to rrTNBC (Fisher exact nominal
p<0.05). We then compared rrTNBC versus lrTNBC (Figure 4D) and found that rrTNBC were
significantly more likely to harbor a mutation in TP53 compared to lrTNBC patients (Fisher exact FDR
p=0.009). There were no other genes that were significantly different when comparing rapid vs. late
vs. no relapse after multiple test correction (Supplementary Figure 3A). Among CNAs, the copy

number landscape was similar across all three groups (Supplementary Figure 3B) and there were
no significantly altered genes or regions among rapid vs. late vs. no relapse after multiple test
correction. There were several regions that demonstrated enrichment within specific groups (nominal
p<0.05), including: 3q28 gain, 8p11 gain, and 21q21-22 gain enriched in relapse relative to nrTNBC;
5p12-13 loss and 6p25 loss enriched in nrTNBC relative to relapse; 6q23-24 loss enriched in lrTNBC
relative to rrTNBC; and 15q23-26 loss enriched in rrTNBC relative to lrTNBC (Figure 4C-D).

Optimal clinical and multi-‘omic model of rapid versus late versus no relapse in TNBC
Having identified discrete clinical, expression, immune, mutation, and copy number features among
primary TNBCs with distinct clinical outcomes, we sought to develop an optimal, multi-‘omic predictive
model for rrTNBC versus lrTNBC versus nrTNBC. As has been applied previously in complex breast
cancer data17, we compared performance of multinomial logistic regression model to Artificial Neural
Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Determinant
Analysis (LDA), and Random Forest (RF) (Figure 5A). We included any feature present in all
samples (n=312) with a nominal p<0.05, which resulted in a total of 77 clinical, expression, immune,
mutation, and copy number features (Figure 5A). Our total multi-‘omic dataset was divided into 70%
training and 30% validation cohorts, independently sampled for each cross validation (10-fold cross
validation). We assessed each model’s performance using three separate receiver-operator
characteristics (ROCs) (rrTNBC as positive, lrTNBC as positive, and nrTNBC as positive) due to 3level classification. We then integrated these into a single ROC curve via micro-averaging (Figure
5B). All models performed relatively well, with highest average AUC 0.772 (SVM) and lowest average
AUC 0.681 (ANN) (Figure 5C). When comparing models, SVM had the highest average AUC,
significantly higher than all other models (all Wilcoxon rank sum p<0.05), followed by RF and
multinomial. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated our approach using only the 18 most significant
features that were all FDR p<0.05 in descriptive statistics and found that using fewer features led to

similar average AUC (range 0.695 to 0.748), with random forest performing best (all Wilcoxon rank
sum p<0.05) followed by SVM and multinomial (Supplementary Figure 3C).

DISCUSSION
TNBC is a vexingly heterogeneous disease, as evidenced by multiple efforts to categorize subsets of
which have primarily focused on intrinsic features of TNBC10-12,24 to reveal underlying biology, with
fewer efforts focused on long-term outcomes. When considering clinical impact, response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains the best prognostic biomarker for TNBC,32 but once TNBC
patients develop metastatic relapse, there are clear differences in disease course among TNBCs who
develop relapse early versus late. To delineate these groups by relapse timing for further analyses,
we provide a novel definition for rapid versus late relapse in TNBC and demonstrate clear differences
in genomic features that cut across existing TNBC intrinsic subtypes.

When comparing TNBCs who relapse versus those who do not, both rrTNBC and lrTNBC had lower
expression of immune signatures, reflecting reduced anti-tumor immune response compared with
nrTNBCs. The correlation between immune cells and positive outcomes is well-established and tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with improved response to NAC as well as better
prognosis in TNBC.38-44 Particularly given recent FDA approval of immunotherapy for metastatic
TNBC6, there is great interest to augment the existing host anti-tumor immune response and also
work to activate immune ‘cold’ tumors.45-49 The differences between late and rapid relapse primarily
reflect differences in luminal features. lrTNBCs are more likely to be non-basal (primarily luminal A/B)
and our data identify that eight estrogen/luminal signatures are associated with late relapse. Multiple
groups have identified a ‘luminal androgen receptor’ subset of TNBC based on molecular
classifications,10,12 and 40% (20/49) of the Lehmann LAR subtype tumors in our cohort ultimately had
late relapse. The wide distribution of Lehmann TNBC subtypes among the lrTNBC group suggest that
we may need additional approaches to identify tumors with this phenotype at risk for late relapse.

Collectively, our data support the categorization by Burstein, et al12 and suggest that ‘rapid relpase’
TNBCs are likely enriched for the ‘basal-like immune suppressed’ phenotype.

Clinically, multi-‘omic models could serve as an adjunct to neoadjuvant chemotherapy response to
predict patients at high risk of rapid relapse to guide more aggressive therapy while identifying those
likely to be cured (even with residual disease) to avoid unnecessary toxicity of additional treatment.
Given our interest to understand what genomic features contribute, we considered the best way to
overcome the significant challenge extracting important features of machine learning algorithms.
Because multi-‘omic data has clear features that can be extracted,50 we first identified the relatively
few specific features that were significantly different across subsets (77 features from >35,000 initial
data points) then built models based on a priori feature identification. This approach identified key
genomic features up-front and led to overall good performance of multiple models but may miss
unexpected interactions among raw features.

Stage at diagnosis was strongly associated with rapid relapse in univariate analyses and in the
multinomial model (where feature contribution could be extracted), stage was the feature contributing
most to the model. This suggests that despite our efforts to use complex biological data, stage
remains critical. One hypothesis is that stage at diagnosis captures non-biological features such as
socioeconomic or demographics, including income, education, insurance, and access to care.51-55
Race/ethnicity is complex,56-58 was largely unavailable in the included datasets, and warrants further
study.59,60 We are currently evaluating the association of sociodemographic features and
race/ethnicity with rrTNBC in other data sources.

While this study presents promising methods to categorize TNBC relapse it does possess some
limitations. The retrospective nature of our data means that patients might not perfectly fit the
definitions we assigned, for example, a small number of late relapse events may occur in the nrTNBC

group after 5 years. We incorporated genomic data from multiple studies, generated using multiple
platforms, and over years. While we have attempted to account for this through standard
normalization approaches and analysis only of summary statistics (e.g. expression signatures not
individual genes), batch/platform effects and computational analyses could impact our results.
Therapy for TNBC has changed over the past 2-3 years, including widespread incorporation of
capecitabine after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for residual disease based on CREATE-X61 and recent
FDA approval of immunotherapy for metastatic, PD-L1 positive TNBC.6

In conclusion, we offer a new definition for ‘rapid relapse’ TNBC and provide evidence that rrTNBC
reflects a distinct clinical entity characterized by unique genomic features. Predictive modeling may
identify patients at high risk for ‘rapid relapse’ and offers potential to guide additional therapy or
clinical trials for these high-risk patients.
