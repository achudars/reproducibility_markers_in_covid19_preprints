ABSTRACT

2

Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14), a transmembrane

3

proteinase with a short cytoplasmic tail, is a major effector of extracellular matrix (ECM)

4

remodeling. Genetic silencing of MT1-MMP in mouse (Mmp14-/-) and man causes

5

dwarfism, osteopenia, generalized arthritis and lipodystrophy. These abnormalities have

6

been ascribed to defective collagen turnover. We have previously shown non-proteolytic

7

functions of MT1-MMP mediated by its cytoplasmic tail, where the unique tyrosine (Y573)

8

controls intracellular signaling. Mutation of Y573 (Y573D) blocks signaling without

9

affecting proteolytic activity. Here we report that a mouse with the MT1-MMP Y573D

10

mutation (Mmp14Y573D/Y573D) shows abnormalities similar to those of Mmp14-/- mice.

11

Skeletal stem cells (SSC) of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice show defective differentiation

12

consistent with the mouse phenotype, which is rescued by wild-type SSC transplant.

13

These results provide the first in vivo demonstration that MT1-MMP, an ECM-degrading

14

proteinase, modulates bone, cartilage and fat homeostasis by controlling SSC

15

differentiation through a mechanism independent of proteolysis.

INTRODUCTION

2

Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, or MMP-14), the product of

3

the gene MMP14, is a cell-membrane-bound proteinase with an extracellular catalytic site

4

and a 20-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (Itoh, 2015; Sato et al., 1994). It degrades a variety

5

of ECM components and is expressed by a wide array of normal and tumor cells. Notably,

6

MT1-MMP is the only MMP whose genetic deficiency in the mouse results in severe

7

phenotypes and early death. These features have implicated MT1-MMP as an important

8

component of the proteolytic mechanisms of physiological and pathological processes

9

including bone, cartilage and adipose tissue homeostasis, as well as tumor invasion,

10

angiogenesis and metastasis. The analysis of the phenotype of mice genetically deficient

11

in MT1-MMP (Mmp14-/-) has shown key roles of this proteinase in the postnatal

12

development and growth of cartilage, bone and adipose tissue. Mmp14 deficiency in the

13

mouse results in dwarfism, severe osteopenia, generalized arthritis and lipodystrophy,

14

among other abnormalities (Chun et al., 2006; Chun & Inoue, 2014; Holmbeck et al.,

15

1999; Zhou et al., 2000). In humans a mutation of MMP14 causes multicentric osteolysis

16

and arthritis disease, or Winchester syndrome, which recapitulates much of the

17

phenotype of the Mmp14-/- mouse (Evans et al., 2012). Conditional Mmp14 knockout in

18

uncommitted skeletal stem cells (SSC, also referred to as mesenchymal stem cells), the

19

common progenitors of osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes, recapitulates the

20

skeletal phenotype of the global Mmp14 knockout mouse (Y. Tang et al., 2013).

21

Conversely, unlike global Mmp14 deficiency conditional Mmp14 knockout in SSC results

22

in thickening of articular cartilage and increased bone marrow (BM)-associated fat but

23

decreased subcutaneous fat, which derives from distinct progenitor cells (Chun et al.,

24

2006; Gupta et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2012). In light of the fundamental role of MT1-MMP

1

in ECM degradation, it has been proposed that the phenotypes of Mmp14-/- mice result

2

from defective collagen turnover (Chun et al., 2006; Chun & Inoue, 2014; Holmbeck et

3

al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2000).

4

However, a number of in vitro studies have provided evidence for a variety of non-

5

proteolytic roles of MT1-MMP. We have previously shown that the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic

6

tail activates Ras-ERK1/2 and Akt signaling by a non-proteolytic mechanism that controls

7

cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo

8

(D'Alessio et al., 2008; Valacca et al., 2015). Signaling is activated in a dose- and time-

9

dependent manner by MT1-MMP binding of low nanomolar concentrations of tissue

10

inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), a physiological protein inhibitor of MT1-MMP.

11

Signaling activation is also mediated by mutant TIMP-2 lacking MMP inhibitory activity

12

(Ala+ TIMP-2) as well as by mutant MT1-MMP devoid of proteolytic activity (MT1-MMP

13

E240A), showing that the signaling mechanism is proteolysis-independent. We also

14

showed that MT1-MMP signaling requires the unique tyrosine (Y573) in the cytoplasmic

15

tail, which is phosphorylated by Src and LIM1 kinases (Lagoutte et al., 2016; Nyalendo et

16

al., 2007), and that Y573 substitution with aspartic acid (Y573D), a negatively charged

17

amino acid like phosphotyrosine, abrogates MT1-MMP-mediated activation of Ras-

18

ERK1/2 (D'Alessio et al., 2008). Other groups have subsequently found that Y573

19

controls a variety of signaling pathways and cell functions in vitro (Annabi et al., 2009;

20

Belkaid et al., 2007; Gonzalo et al., 2010; Proulx-Bonneau et al., 2011; Sakamoto & Seiki,

21

2009; Sina et al., 2010). Y573 is required for activation of the small GTPase Rac1

22

(Gonzalo et al., 2010), controls macrophage migration and infiltration at sites of

23

inflammation (Gonzalo et al., 2010; Sakamoto & Seiki, 2009), as well as MT1-MMP

24

interaction with Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Y. Wang & McNiven, 2012).

Based on these observations, we generated a mutant mouse with the Y573D

2

substitution in the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP (MT1-MMP Y573D). Here we report that

3

this mouse shows abnormalities in postnatal bone, cartilage and adipose tissue

4

development and growth that partly recapitulate the phenotype of the MMP14-/- mouse.

These phenotypes derive from dysregulation of BM SSC differentiation, and are rescued

by wild-type (wt) BM transplant.

RESULTS

2

Generation and characterization of MT1-MMP Y573D mice

3

Mice heterozygous (MmpY573D/wt) or homozygous (MmpY573D/Y573D) for the MT1-MMP

4

Y573D mutation, generated as described in Materials and Methods (Fig. 1), were

5

macroscopically indistinguishable from Mmp14wt/wt mice at birth. However, after the first

6

2 months Mmp14Y573D/wt and Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice showed a slightly lower growth rate

7

than their Mmp14wt/wt littermates (Fig. 2 A). In mice older than 3 months the weight of

8

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D male and female mice was 15 % lower than that of age- and sex-

9

matched Mmp14wt/wt littermates (Fig. 2 B).

10

By Western blotting (Fig. 2 C), Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice showed tissue levels of MT1-

11

MMP comparable to that of Mmp14wt/wt mice. Consistent with previous findings (Uekita et

12

al., 2001), primary fibroblasts from 3-weeks old Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice and Mmp14wt/wt

13

littermates had similar MT1-MMP proteolytic activity (Fig. 2 D). Thus, the Y573D mutation

14

did not significantly alter the plasma membrane expression or proteolytic activity of MT1-

15

MMP. In addition, in agreement with our previous findings (D'Alessio et al., 2008; Valacca

16

et al., 2015), primary fibroblasts from Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice showed strongly reduced

17

ERK1/2 and Akt activation in response to exogenous TIMP-2 relative to Mmp14wt/wt cells

18

(Fig. 2 E).

MT1-MMP Y573D mice show structural and gene expression abnormalities in bone,

bones, with severe osteopenia and arthritis (Holmbeck et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2000). At

1

5 months of age the femurs of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice were only ~ 5% shorter than those

2

of Mmp14wt/wt mice (14.81 ± 0.1519 mm vs. 15.61 ± 0.0619 mm; n=10; p = 0.0001).

3

However, cortical bone thickness at the femur mid-diaphysis was markedly decreased

4

(20-25%) in Mmp14Y573D/Y573D vs. Mmp14wt/wt mice (Fig. 3 A), a finding consistent with the

5

osteopenia of the Mmp14-/- mouse (Holmbeck et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2000). Conversely,

6

unlike Mmp14-/- mice, which have reduced trabecular bone, and in the homozygous but

7

not in the heterozygous state (Holmbeck et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2000), femurs and tibias

8

showed significantly increased (40-50%) trabecular bone in both Mmp14Y573D/Y573D and

9

Mmp14Y573D/wt mice relative to age- and sex-matched Mmp14wt/wt mice (Fig. 3 B - D). This

10

effect was accompanied by increased TRAP-positive osteoclasts (Fig. 3 – supplement 1),

11

indicating enhanced bone remodeling, a feature also observed in Mmp14-/- mice

12

(Holmbeck et al., 1999).

13

Gene expression profiling of bone from Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice (Fig. 3 E) showed 76

14

genes significantly (p ≤ 0.05) up- or downregulated relative to Mmp14wt/wt littermates. A

15

subset of 17 of these transcripts were upregulated 2-fold or more, and 26 were

16

downregulated 2-fold or more. Consistent with the morphometric analyses, gene ontology

17

analysis showed highly significant enrichment for biological processes related to

18

osteoblast differentiation, bone remodeling, ossification and bone growth (Fig. 3 F).

19

The knee joints of 2-month old mice showed several abnormalities. Both

20

Mmp14Y573D/wt and Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice displayed marked thinning of articular cartilage

21

(Fig. 4 A top panels, and B) with loss of proteoglycans (Fig. 4 C and D), clustering and

cloning of chondrocytes (Fig. 4 A lower panels), classic histologic features of the articular

1

OA in mice. The knee cartilage of 2-year old mice also showed fissures, chondrocyte

2

clustering and cloning, abnormalities typical of ageing-associated cartilage degeneration

3

that were not observed in age- and sex-matched Mmp14wt/wt mice (Fig. 4 E).

4

RNA-Seq analysis of the transcriptome of cartilage from Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice (Fig.

5

5 A) showed significant dysregulation of the expression of 1,549 genes relative to

6

Mmp14wt/wt mice (p ≤ 0.05). Of these genes, 694 were upregulated 2-fold or more, and 92

7

were downregulated 2-fold or more. Gene ontology analysis (Fig. 5 B) showed highly

8

significant enrichment for biological processes related to extracellular matrix

9

homeostasis, cartilage development and chondrocyte differentiation. As these biological

10

processes are strongly dysregulated in human OA, we analyzed the transcriptome of

11

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D cartilage for expression of genes involved in human OA (Fig. 5 C). Gene

12

expression profiling of human OA cartilage has revealed 1,423 genes significantly (p ≤

13

0.05) up- or downregulated relative to normal cartilage, 111 of which are strongly up- or

14

downregulated (≥ 2-fold or ≤ 2-fold) (Geyer et al., 2009; Karlsson et al., 2010). We found

15

that 48 of these 111 OA-associated genes are also strongly regulated in Mmp14Y573D/Y573D

16

mouse cartilage, including all the genes for collagens and other ECM proteins

17

upregulated in human OA, ECM-degrading proteinases, as well as genes involved in cell

18

metabolism (Figure 5 D). Thus, consistent with its histological features, Mmp14Y573D/Y573D

19

joint cartilage showed significant gene expression similarity to human OA.

20

Sections of the long bones of adult Mmp14Y573D/wt and Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice also

21

showed marked decrease in BM-associated fat relative to Mmp14wt/wt littermates (Fig. 6

22

A and B). A similar reduction was apparent in all other fat pads, as evidenced by ~ 50%

23

decrease in body adiposity by DEXA analysis and in the gonadal fat of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D

mice relative to age- and sex-matched Mmp14wt/wt littermates (Fig. 6 C and D). This effect

2

was observed in mice of both sexes and ages ranging 3 months to 2 years (Fig. 6 -

3

supplements 1 and 2). Histological analysis of abdominal and subcutaneous WAT from

4

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice revealed marked decrease in the size of adipocytes (Fig. 7 A, C

5

and supplement 1). These findings are consistent with the lipodystrophy of Mmp14-/- mice

6

(Chun et al., 2006; Chun et al., 2010). In contrast, the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of

7

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice showed pronounced adipocyte hypertrophy, with decreased

8

expression of the characteristic marker of BAT, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1; Fig. 7 B

9

and supplement 2).

10

The transcriptome of abdominal WAT from Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice (Fig. 7 D) showed

11

significant (p ≤ 0.05) up- or downregulation of the expression of 151 genes, relative to

12

Mmp14wt/wt mice. Gene ontology analysis (Fig. 7 E) identified highly significant enrichment

13

for biological processes including control of small molecule synthesis, lipid and fatty acid

14

metabolism, response to corticosteroids, and extracellular matrix homeostasis. Some of

15

these pathways are also overrepresented in Mmp14+/- mice on a high-fat diet (Chun et

16

al., 2010). Moreover, similar to Mmp14+/- mice, Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice were protected

17

from body weight gain induced by high-fat diet (Fig. 7 – supplement 3).

18

In addition to reduced WAT, Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice showed strongly decreased

19

fasting levels of plasma insulin relative to age- and sex-matched Mmp14wt/wt littermates,

20

with normoglycemia and normal food consumption (Fig. 8 and supplement 1).

21

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D and Mmp14wt/wt mice also had comparable levels of ACTH, which

22

controls adipose tissue metabolism, and leptin, a hormone secreted predominantly by

23

adipose tissue. Conversely, Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice had extremely low serum levels of the

MT1-MMP Y573D expression alters skeletal stem cell proliferation and apoptosis,

6

and skews differentiation from chondro- and adipogenesis towards osteogenesis

7

The observation that the phenotype of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice involves abnormalities

8

of bone, cartilage and adipose tissue indicated that the MT1-MMP Y573D mutation might

9

affect the differentiation of SSC, the common progenitor cells of these tissues. Therefore,

10

we isolated SSC from the BM of Mmp14wt/wt and Mmp14Y573D/Y573D littermates, and

11

characterized them in vitro (Fig. 9). Mmp14Y573D/Y573D SSC contained fewer colony-

12

forming units-fibroblasts (CFU-F) than Mmp14wt/wt SSC (1.5x10-6 vs. 4.5x10-6,

13

respectively), formed much smaller colonies (Fig. 9 A), and showed remarkably lower

14

proliferation rate and higher apoptosis index (Fig. 9 B and C). RNA-Seq analysis (Fig. 9

15

D) showed 486 genes significantly dysregulated (p ≤ 0.05) in Mmp14Y573D/Y573D vs.

16

Mmp14wt/wt SSC. Gene ontology analysis (Fig. 9 E) revealed highly significant enrichment

17

of genes involved in DNA synthesis, cell cycle regulation and response to DNA damage,

18

indicating dysregulation of cell proliferation and survival.

19

We then induced BM-derived SSC from Mmp14Y573D/Y573D and Mmp14wt/wt littermates

20

to differentiate in vitro into the osteoblast, chondrocyte and adipocyte lineages. qPCR

21

analysis of the expression of lineage-specific markers showed dramatic increase in

22

osteogenesis (Fig. 9 F, top panel), and marked decrease in chondrocyte and adipocyte

23

differentiation (Fig. 9 F, middle and bottom panels, respectively) in Mmp14Y573D/Y573D vs.

Mmp14wt/wt SSC. The expression levels of wt MT1-MMP and MT1-MMP Y573D did not

2

change during osteoblast differentiation, and on day 17 comparable levels of MT1-MMP

3

mRNA were expressed by Mmp14wt/wt and Mmp14Y573D/Y573D SSC (Fig. 9 F; top panel).

4

Conversely, in agreement with previous reports (Y. Tang et al., 2013), MT1-MMP

5

expression decreased by ~ 80% during chondrocyte differentiation in both Mmp14wt/wt and

6

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D SSC, and on day 17 Mmp14Y573D/Y573D cells expressed significantly

7

lower MT1-MMP levels than Mmp14wt/wt SSC (Fig. 9 F, middle panel).

8

To confirm that the differences in BM-SSC differentiation between Mmp14wt/wt and

9

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice are mediated by the MT1-MMP Y573D mutation, we transfected

10

wt MT1-MMP or MT1-MMP Y573D cDNA into mouse C3H10T1/2 cells, which are

11

functionally similar to SSC (Q. Q. Tang et al., 2004), and analyzed their capacity to

12

differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes (Fig. 9 G) by lineage-specific

13

staining. Consistent with the results obtained with primary BM-derived SSC, C3H10T1/2

14

cells transfected with MT1-MMP Y573D showed markedly increased osteogenesis, and

15

decreased chondro- and adipogenesis relative to wt MT1-MMP transfectants (Fig. 9 G).

16

Therefore, in both BM-derived SSC and C3H10T1/2 cells MT1-MMP Y573D expression

17

skewed differentiation towards the osteogenic lineage.

21

These results indicated that the bone, cartilage and fat phenotypes of

22

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice result from a defect in SSC. Therefore, we hypothesized that the

23

phenotypes of these mice could be rescued by transplantation of Mmp14wt/wt BM; and,

1

vice versa, transplantation of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D BM could transfer the phenotype to

2

Mmp14wt/wt mice. We therefore transplanted 3- and 5-month old mice with BM from mice

3

of the same age and the opposite genotype or, as controls, from mice of the same age

4

and genotype, and analyzed their phenotypes two months later.

5

We characterized the trabecular and cortical bone of the femurs of the transplanted

6

mice by microCT analysis (Fig. 10). The results showed that transplantation of Mmp14wt/wt

7

BM had no effect on the cortical bone of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice transplanted at 3 months

8

or 5 months of age (Fig. 10 A and supplement 1); however, it completely rescued their

9

trabecular bone phenotype (Fig. 10 B and supplement 1). Conversely, transplantation of

10

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D BM did not transfer the trabecular or cortical bone phenotype to wt mice.

11

We also found that BM transplant induced no significant changes in articular

cartilage thickness relative to the original phenotype of the transplant recipients in this

13

short-term study (data not shown).

14

Similarly to the bone phenotype, Mmp14wt/wt BM transplant completely rescued the

15

decrease in fat mass of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice, but Mmp14Y573D/Y573D BM did not transfer

16

the adipose tissue phenotype to Mmp14wt/wt mice (Fig. 11 A). However, consistent with

17

the existence of BM-derived adipocyte precursors able to colonize peripheral WAT and

18

BAT (Crossno et al., 2006), histological analysis of WAT and BAT from transplanted mice

19

(Fig. 11 B and C) showed mixtures of normal and hypotrophic white adipocytes in both

20

Mmp14wt/wt mice transplanted with Mmp14Y573D/Y573D BM and Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice

21

transplanted with Mmp14wt/wt BM. Conversely, BM recipients acquired the BAT phenotype

22

of donor mice (Fig. 11 C).

DISCUSSION

2

MT1-MMP plays an important role in the postnatal development of a variety of

3

tissues including bone, cartilage and fat. The striking abnormalities of Mmp14-/- mice –

4

dwarfism, severe osteopenia, generalized arthritis, fibrosis and lipodystrophy - have been

5

ascribed to impaired collagen turnover, which also plays a fundamental role in SSC

6

differentiation and affects adipocyte development (Chun et al., 2006; Chun & Inoue, 2014;

7

Holmbeck et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2000). The data presented in this paper show that, in

8

addition to its proteolytic activity, MT1-MMP contributes to bone, cartilage and adipose

9

tissue homeostasis through a proteolysis-independent mechanism mediated by its

10

cytoplasmic domain. This conclusion is based on the following observations.

11

We have previously shown that MT1-MMP activates ERK1/2 and Akt signaling upon

12

binding of physiological concentrations of TIMP-2 (D'Alessio et al., 2008; Valacca et al.,

13

2015). Signaling is activated by mutant MT1-MMP devoid of proteolytic activity (MT1-

14

MMP E240A) or TIMP-2 lacking MMP inhibitory activity (Ala+ TIMP-2), and is blocked by

15

the Y573D substitution in the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic tail. As this mutation does not

16

significantly alter the cell surface expression or proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP (Uekita

17

et al., 2001) (Fig. 2), these findings showed that MT1-MMP activation of ERK1/2 and Akt

18

signaling is independent of its proteolytic activity and mediated by its cytoplasmic domain.

19

To investigate the physiological significance of our in vitro findings, we generated a

20

mouse in which MT1-MMP activation of ERK1/2 and Akt is abrogated by the Y573D

21

mutation. The data presented in this paper show that mice bearing this mutation present

22

phenotypes that recapitulate those caused by Mmp14 deficiency. The phenotypes of

23

Mmp14Y573D/Y573 mice appear to be milder than those of Mmp14-/- mice, indicating that

1

both the proteolytic and signaling functions of MT1-MMP are required for normal postnatal

2

development and homeostasis. However, while comparing the phenotypes of

3

Mmp14Y573D/Y573 and Mmp14-/- mice provides information about the relative contribution of

4

the proteolytic and non-proteolytic functions of MT1-MMP to postnatal development and

5

tissue homeostasis, significant limitations must be considered. Mmp14-/- mice die within

6

2 months of age (Holmbeck & al., 1999), whereas Mmp14Y573D/Y573 mice have a normal

7

life span and their phenotypes become apparent in animals older than 2 months. The

8

global deficiency of Mmp14 causes severe runting and wasting that ultimately lead to

9

death. It is possible that the dramatic abnormalities of some tissues including cartilage

10

and fat result from indirect effects. For instance, the generalized inflammatory state of

11

Mmp14-/- mice (Shimizu-Hirota et al., 2012) may be the cause of, or contribute to their

12

severe arthritis. Indeed, conditional Mmp14 knockout in uncommitted SSC results in

13

increased thickness of the articular cartilage in 3-month old mice (Y. Tang et al., 2013),

14

in contrast with the reduced thickness and degeneration of Mmp14-/- and

15

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D cartilage (Holmbeck & al., 1999).

16

Furthermore, the relative contribution of MT1-MMP proteolytic and signaling

17

functions to postnatal development and homeostasis may vary at different stages of

18

postnatal life. The lethality of Mmp14 deficiency limits our understanding of the role of

19

MT1-MMP to relatively early stages of postnatal development; in contrast, the normal life

20

span of Mmp14Y573D/Y573 mice affords studying the role of MT1-MMP in adult animals. Our

21

finding that the phenotype of the Mmp14Y573D/Y573 mouse becomes apparent in adult mice

22

indicates that the proteolytic and the signaling function of MT1-MMP have predominant

23

roles at different stages of postnatal development. The severe phenotype and early

24

mortality of the Mmp14-/- mouse shows that MT1-MMP proteolytic activity has a

1

fundamental role at early stages. Conversely, silencing MT1-MMP signaling is compatible

2

with normal development but results in altered tissue homeostasis in the adult animal.

3

Our analysis of the articular cartilage of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice showed signs of

4

tissue degeneration similar to, but milder than that of Mmp14-/- mice. However, whereas

5

Mmp14-/- mice have severe, acute arthritis (Holmbeck & al., 1999), the articular cartilage

6

of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice shows histological signs and gene expression profile

7

comparable to human OA, a chronic degenerative condition. The striking similarity of the

8

gene expression profile of the articular cartilage of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice to that of human

9

OA raises an interesting point about the role of MT1-MMP in articular cartilage

10

homeostasis and the pathogenesis of OA. MT1-MMP expression decreases during

11

chondrocyte differentiation, and in differentiated chondrocytes is ~ 80% lower than in

12

undifferentiated SSC (Y. Tang et al., 2013). Consistent with this finding, Mmp14

13

deficiency in uncommitted SSC results in increased differentiation into chondrocytes and

14

thickening of articular cartilage (Y. Tang et al., 2013), suggesting that MT1-MMP

15

expression contrasts normal chondrocyte development and articular cartilage

16

homeostasis. Indeed, MT1-MMP is upregulated in OA cartilage relative to normal

17

cartilage (Dreier et al., 2004; Kevorkian et al., 2004; Tchetina et al., 2005), indicating that

18

MT1-MMP expression must be strictly controlled for normal cartilage homeostasis. In

19

Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice chondrocyte expression of MT1-MMP is lower than in Mmp14wt/wt

20

mice (Fig. 9 F); however, their cartilage is thinner and presents signs of degeneration,

21

showing that altering MT1-MMP signaling has a pathological effect even in the presence

22

of low levels of MT1-MMP proteolytic activity. Thus, MT1-MMP signaling is required for

23

articular cartilage homeostasis.

1

Our phenotypic analysis of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice showed significant abnormalities

2

in WAT, consistent with the phenotype of Mmp14-/- mice and of mice with conditional

3

Mmp14 knockout in uncommitted SSC (Y. Tang et al., 2013). However, some differences

4

are noteworthy. In contrast to WAT hypotrophy, we surprisingly found BAT hypertrophy

5

in Mmp14Y573D/Y573 mice, a finding at variance with the normal BAT of Mmp14-/- mice

6

(Chun et al., 2006). Similarly, BM-associated WAT is decreased in Mmp14Y573D/Y573 mice

7

but increased in mice with conditional knockout of Mmp14 in uncommitted SSC (Y. Tang

8

et al., 2013) (unfortunately, the severe wasting and early death of Mmp14-/- mice preclude

9

a reliable assessment of BM-associated fat, which typically develops with aging).

10

However, while the SSC of conditional Mmp14-/- mice show increased adipocyte

11

differentiation in vitro (Y. Tang et al., 2013), the SSC of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice show

12

decreased adipocyte differentiation. MT1-MMP is a fundamental effector of adipocyte

13

growth through collagen degradation, a process required for adipocyte increase in size

14

(Chun et al., 2006; Chun & Inoue, 2014). However, Mmp14-/- mice have multiple, severe

15

developmental and metabolic defects that can affect adipose tissue development

16

indirectly. Our data show that in vivo MT1-MMP contributes to both WAT and BAT

17

homeostasis by a proteolysis-independent mechanism mediated by its cytoplasmic tail.

18

Several studies have shown the involvement of MT1-MMP in adipose tissue homeostasis

19

(Chun et al., 2006; Feinberg et al., 2016; Fenech, Gavrilovic, Malcolm, et al., 2015;

20

Fenech, Gavrilovic, & Turner, 2015), and genetic associations between MT1-MMP and

21

obesity in humans have been reported (Chun et al., 2010). MT1-MMP has also been

22

proposed to control metabolic balance (Mori et al., 2016), a function that could explain

23

the WAT and BAT abnormalities of MT1-MMP Y573D mice. Understanding the

1

proteolysis-independent mechanism of MT1-MMP control of adipose tissue homeostasis

2

can therefore have significant clinical and pharmacological implications.

3

The cortical bone of Mmp14Y573D/Y573 mice shows a significant decrease in thickness,

4

a phenotype similar to – if milder than - that caused by Mmp14 deficiency. In contrast, the

5

increased trabecular bone of Mmp14Y573D/Y573 mice contrasts with the severe osteopenia

6

of Mmp14-/- mice and mice with Mmp14 knockout in uncommitted SSC (Holmbeck & al.,

7

1999; Y. Tang et al., 2013). This discrepancy between the phenotypic effects of the MT1-

8

MMP Y573D mutation and Mmp14 deficiency suggests that the proteolytic and signaling

9

functions of MT1-MMP can have opposing roles in bone physiology, and that a balance

10

between the two functions is required for tissue homeostasis. Deletion of the gene

11

abrogates both functions, whereas the MT1-MMP Y573D mutation only affects signaling,

12

altering the balance between ECM proteolysis and intracellular signaling. Moreover, it

13

should be noted again that the bone phenotype of the global or conditional Mmp14

14

knockout in SSC can only be observed within the first two-three months of age, whereas

15

the bone abnormalities of Mmp14Y573D/Y573 mice become apparent in animals older than

16

two months. It is possible that the proteolytic and signaling functions of MT1-MMP play

17

different roles in bone modeling (postnatal development) and remodeling (adult life),

18

respectively.

19

Consistent with their respective phenotypes, the BM-SSC of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice

20

show increased osteoblast differentiation, and decreased chondrocyte and adipocyte

21

differentiation. Our finding that the bone and adipose tissue phenotypes can be rescued

22

by Mmp14wt/wt BM transplant shows that the in vivo effects of the MT1-MMP Y573D

23

mutation result from dysregulation of SSC differentiation. Several considerations can

explain the failure of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D BM to transfer the mutant phenotypes to

2

Mmp14wt/wt mice, as well as the incapacity of Mmp14wt/wt BM to rescue the cartilage

3

phenotype of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice. Mmp14Y573D/Y573D SSC have significantly reduced

4

proliferation and increased apoptosis relative to Mmp14wt/wt SSC (Fig. 9 A - C). We

5

examined the phenotypes of the transplanted mice 2 months after the transplant. While

6

hematopoietic cells from Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice were able to efficiently repopulate the

7

BM of wt mice – indeed, we found no peripheral blood abnormalities in Mmp14Y573D/Y573D

8

mice – Mmp14Y573D/Y573D SSC might have required a longer time than wt cells for the

9

phenotypic effects to become apparent. Similarly, BM transplant did not affect the cortical

10

bone phenotype of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice. Cortical bone has a much slower turnover than

11

trabecular bone (Clarke, 2008); therefore a longer time is required for its homeostasis to

12

be altered. The failure of our BM transplant experiments to affect the articular cartilage

13

phenotype is consistent with the absence of vascularization of this tissue. Indeed, no

14

attempts at treating joint cartilage diseases by systemic stem cell administration have

15

thus far been effective (Jevotovsky et al., 2018).

16

MT1-MMP is constitutively expressed in SSC and its levels are differentially

17

modulated during osteogenic vs. chondrogenic/adipogenic differentiation (Y. Tang et al.,

18

2013). The MT1-MMP Y573D mutation and Mmp14 deficiency have opposing effects on

19

SSC differentiation in vitro. Mmp14 knockout in uncommitted SSC has no effect on their

20

differentiation in 2D culture; however, it causes decreased osteogenesis and increased

21

chondro- and adipogenesis in 3D collagen gel (Y. Tang et al., 2013). In contrast, in 2D

22

culture MT1-MMP Y573D expression upregulates SSC differentiation into osteoblasts

23

and downregulates chondrocyte and adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 9 F and G). While the

1

knockout is consistent with the phenotypes of the respective mice, both mutations fail to

2

fully recapitulate the bone, cartilage and fat abnormalities of the global Mmp14-/- mouse,

3

which has osteopenia, lipodystrophy and arthritis. These discrepancies indicate that MT1-

4

MMP controls SSC differentiation by both proteolytic and non-proteolytic mechanisms,

5

and the balance of these two functions is required for normal differentiation. MT1-MMP-

6

mediated ECM degradation modulates mechanosignaling that controls gene expression

7

during SSC differentiation into osteoblasts, and conditional Mmp14 deficiency in SSC

8

blocks osteogenesis and causes severe osteopenia (Y. Tang et al., 2013). Normal SSC

9

differentiation requires the concerted action of ECM remodeling and intracellular

10

signaling, cell functions modulated by the extracellular environment. In vitro, in the

11

presence of abundant ECM - such as in collagen gel culture (Y. Tang et al., 2013) – the

12

proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP is indispensable. Conversely, in the presence of relatively

13

low amounts of ECM – such as in 2D culture – the role of intracellular signaling becomes

14

prevalent. In vivo, cell differentiation in the stem cell niche, tissue/organ development and

15

remodeling have different proteolytic and signaling requirements, which are spatially and

16

temporally modulated.

17

The relative contribution of proteolysis and signaling to MT1-MMP function is also

18

coordinated by extracellular ligands that can inhibit extracellular MT1-MMP proteolytic

19

activity and activate intracellular signaling. This hypothesis is supported by our previous

20

finding that TIMP-2 binding to MT1-MMP activates ERK1/2 and Akt signaling (D'Alessio

21

et al., 2008; Valacca et al., 2015), as well as by the observation that in the mouse embryo

22

MT1-MMP is temporally and spatially co-expressed with TIMP-2 in the developing

23

skeleton (Apte et al., 1997; Kinoh et al., 1996). TIMP-2-/- mice do not display the severe

24

phenotype of Mmp14-/- mice (Z. Wang et al., 2000). However, in these mice signaling can

1

be activated by MT1-MMP binding of TIMP-3 or TIMP-4, as well as a variety of

2

extracellular and transmembrane proteins, including integrins and CD44, that

3

physiologically interact with the MT1-MMP ectodomains (Mori et al., 2002; Zhao et al.,

4

2004).

5

Thus, the loss of signaling function caused by the Y573D substitution (D'Alessio et

6

al., 2008; Valacca et al., 2015) (Fig. 2 E) can be at the basis of the defects in SSC

7

differentiation and the consequent phenotypes of the Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mouse. Studies

8

by other groups, as well as our own (unpublished), have shown that, although ERK1/2

9

signaling is important for osteoblast differentiation (Miraoui et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2015;

10

Xiao et al., 2002), chronic inhibition of ERK1/2 activation results in increased SSC

11

differentiation into osteoblasts (Ge et al., 2007; Higuchi et al., 2002; Nakayama et al.,

12

2003; Schindeler & Little, 2006; Zhang et al., 2012); conversely, inhibition of PI3K/Akt

13

signaling blocks adipo- and chondrogenesis (Kim & Chen, 2004; Lee et al., 2015; Li &

14

Dong, 2016; Yang et al., 2011).

15

The molecular mechanism that relays signaling from the Y573 residue of the MT1-

16

MMP cytoplasmic tail to the Ras-ERK1/2 and Ras-Akt pathways (D'Alessio et al., 2008;

17

Valacca et al., 2015), remains to be investigated. The adaptor protein p130Cas, which

18

binds to the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP by a mechanism involving Y573 (Y. Wang &

19

McNiven, 2012), recruits Src and/or focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which activate Ras

20

(Bunda et al., 2014; Schlaepfer & Hunter, 1997). We speculate that TIMP-2 binding to

21

MT1-MMP triggers the assembly of the p130Cas/Src/FAK complex at the MT1-MMP tail,

22

and that this effect is abrogated by the Y573D substitution, which thus prevents the

23

downstream activation of ERK1/2 and Akt signaling. In addition, Y573 could control

intracellular signaling by modulating cytoplasmic tail interactions with a variety of

transmembrane or membrane-bound proteins including caveolin-1 (Annabi et al., 2001;

Galvez et al., 2002; Galvez et al., 2004; Labrecque et al., 2004) and ß1 integrins or growth

4

factor receptors (Langlois et al., 2007).

5

In conclusion, our findings provide the first in vivo evidence for an important role of

6

MT1-MMP mediated, proteolysis-independent signaling in postnatal development and

7

tissue homeostasis. Understanding the relative contribution of the proteolytic and

8

signaling functions of MT1-MMP to the control of metabolic processes that affect a variety

9

of tissues and organs will require the development of additional genetically engineered

10

mouse models, as well as the molecular dissection of extracellular and intracellular

11

components of the MT1-MMP signaling mechanism. The knowledge obtained from these

12

studies can increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of important diseases that

13

affect bone, cartilage and adipose tissue homeostasis, such as osteopenia, osteoarthritis

14

and obesity, and potentially direct the design of novel pharmacological tools for their

15

treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

2

Generation of MT1-MMP Y573D mice

3

To generate a mouse with the Y573D mutation in the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic tail we

4

constructed a targeting vector as described in Figure 1 A. The construct was

5

electroporated into W4 embryonic stem (ES) cells, followed by G418 and gancyclovir

6

double selection. The W4 cells were provided to us by the Rodent Genetic Engineering

7

of NYU School of Medicine, who carried out the blastocysts injections and subsequent

8

procedures. Homologous recombination targeting events were identified in 8 ES cell

9

colonies. Two of these, devoid of chromosome abnormalities by cytogenetic analysis,

10

were used for injection into blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice (C57BL/6NTac; Taconic), and

11

one gave germline transmission. Mice heterozygote for the mutation (Mmp14Y573/wt),

12

identified by PCR analysis with primers flanking the LoxP sites (Fig. 1 A), were crossed

13

with Rosa26Cre Deleter mice (C57BL/6NTac-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm16(cre)Arte; Taconic) to

14

excise the neo cassette. Homozygote MmpY573D/Y573D mice were generated by

15

heterozygote mating, and crossed back to wt C57BL/6 mice to remove the Cre

16

recombinase gene. Sequencing of MT1-MMP cDNA from MmpY573D/Y573D mouse tissue

17

showed identity with wt MT1-MMP except for the Y573D mutation. Heterozygote mating

18

produced wt, heterozygote and homozygote mice in the expected Mendelian ratios. The

19

mice were genotyped by PCR using the same primers flanking the loxP sites, which afford

20

identification of the three genotypes (Fig. 1 B). The sequences of these primers are:

15

Micro-CT was performed according to published guidelines (Bouxsein et al., 2010).

16

Bones were scanned using a high-resolution SkyScan micro-CT system (SkyScan 1172,

17

Kontich, Belgium). Images were acquired using a 10 MP digital detector, 10W energy

18

(70kV and 142 mA), and a 0.5-mm aluminum filter with a 9.7-μm image voxel size. A fixed

19

global threshold method was used based on the manufacturer’s recommendations and

20

preliminary studies, which showed that mineral variation between groups was not high

21

enough to warrant adaptive thresholds. The cortical region of interest was selected as the

22

2.0-mm mid-diaphyseal region directly below the third trochanter. The trabecular bone

11

single-cell suspension, the cells were passed through a 70-μm cell strainer, incubated for

12

2 min in NH4Cl red blood cell lysis solution (StemCell Technologies, cat. # 07800,

13

Vancouver, Canada), and seeded into culture plates in αMEM supplemented with 15%

14

FBS and antibiotics. Three hours later non-adherent cells were removed by replacing the

15

medium with fresh complete medium. This procedure was repeated twice a day for the

16

first 72 h. Subsequently, the adherent cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline

17

(PBS) and incubated with fresh medium every 3-4 days until the cultures became

18

subconfluent. To induce differentiation the cells were seeded into 24-well plates (5 x 104

19

20

differentiation medium, and incubation was continued for the indicated times, changing

21

the medium with freshly prepared medium twice a week. For chondrocyte differentiation

22

the cells were seeded into 48-well plates as a pellet (2.5 x 105 cells/well). The medium

BM transplant

15

Mice of 3 and 5 months of age were used for BM transplant experiments. The BM of

16

female mice was transplanted into age-matched male mice. The recipient mice were

17

lethally irradiated with a single dose of 9 Gy. Twenty-four hours later BM cells (BMCs)

18

were collected from the tibias and femurs of donor mice, suspended in PBS containing

19

2% heat-inactivated FBS, and 5 x 106 BMCs in 200 µl were injected into the recipient

20

mice via the tail vein. Eight weeks later the mice were subjected to DEXA scanning

21

analysis and then sacrificed. To verify BM engraftment we transplanted female mice with

22

male BM, in order to characterize the recipients’ BM by immunohistochemistry and/or flow

23

cytometry with antibody to UTY, a Y chromosome marker (H. Wang et al., 2013).

However, several commercially available antibodies failed to recognize UTY in murine

2

BM cells, probably because this marker is not expressed in these cells. For the same

3

reasons we were not able to identify the genotype of transplanted animals’ WAT or BAT

4

by immunohistochemistry with UTY antibody, or RNA in situ hybridization. Therefore, we

5

genotyped the BM of recipient mice for the Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mutation using the PCR

6

primers designed for genotyping our mice. We reasoned that partial engraftment of

7

donor’s BM would result in both the Mmp14wt/wt and Mmp14Y573D/Y573D genotypes, with a

8

pattern of PCR products identical to that of Mmp14Y573D/wt mice (Fig. 1 B). In addition,

9

running the PCR reaction for a high number of cycles would afford detection of small

10

residual amounts of BM from recipient mice. By this method, the results (Fig. 10 – figure

11

supplement 1) showed virtually complete replacement of the recipient’s BM with the

12

donors’ BM. However, we could not use this method to identify donor-derived adipocytes

13

in the transplanted animals’ WAT or BAT as these tissues contain circulating cells – e.g.

14

macrophages – from the BM.

15

Statistical analysis

16

For the BM transplant experiments, to calculate the number of mice required in each

17

group to achieve statistical significance for the expected differences between controls and

18

experimental groups, we used the analysis of Power of Test based on the variance

19

observed in our previous analyses of our mice. In our characterization of the bone,

20

cartilage and fat phenotypes we found differences between MT1-MMP Y573D wt mice

21

ranging 25% - 75% in the mean (m) values of the various parameters, with standard

22

deviations (SD) ranging 25% - 50%. Therefore, we assumed m = 50% and SD = 35%. To

23

calculate the number of animals needed we used the formula: n = (Za +Zb)2 x 2 (%SD)2/

24

(%D)2, where: n is number of animals per group, (Za + Zb)2 for a 2-Tailed test with power

Figure 1. Generation of the MT1-MMP Y573D mouse. A. Schematic representation of
the targeting vector and targeted locus. To construct the targeting vector the genomic
sequence of mouse MT1-MMP containing exons 2 to 10 was PCR amplified from W4
embryonic stem (ES) cells’ DNA. A floxed neomycin resistance cassette (neo) was
inserted into intron 9, adjacent to the 5’ end of exon 10, which encodes Y573, and a
hsv-thymidine kinase cassette (hsvtk) was placed at the 5′ end of the construct. The
TAC codon for Y573 was mutated into GAC by PCR. The construct was electroporated
into W4 ES cells and colonies of recombinant cells were selected as described in
Materials and Methods. The red X indicates the Y573D substitution; B: BamHI; C: ClaI;
E: EcoRI; N: NotI; S: SalI; X: XhoI. B. PCR genotyping. The mice were genotyped by
PCR using primers flanking the loxP sites, which afford identification of the three
genotypes. The sequence of the primers is reported in Materials and Methods.

shown as a loading control. Equal protein amounts of cell extracts were run in two separate gels and
transferred onto separate membranes, one of which was probed with antibodies to the phosphoERK1/2 and phospho-Akt, and the other to total ERK1/2 and Akt. This experiment was performed three
times with similar results.

mass in Mmp14wt/wt mice. Mean ± s.d. are shown. *: p = 0.006; ‡: p = 0.008; Ӿ: p = 0.003; ¥:

and recipient phenotypes. Histological sections of periepididymal WAT (A) and
infrascapular BAT (B) of the mice described in Fig. 8. H&E staining; original magnification: A,
10X; B, 20X. The YD►YD samples show hypotrophic white adipocytes (A) and hypertrophic
brown adipocytes, as expected (Fig. 5 B and C); wt ► YD or YD► wt BM transplant results
in a mixture of normal and hypotrophic white adipocytes (A), and in recipient mice acquiring
the BAT phenotype of the donors.

Figure 10 – figure supplement 1. PCR genotyping of BM from mice transplanted with
BM as indicated (YD►wt: Mmp14wt/wt mice transplanted with BM from Mmp14Y573D/Y573D
mice; wt►YD: Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice transplanted with Mmp14wt/wt BM. BM from nontransplanted Mmp14wt/wt mice (wt) or Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice (YD) is shown as control. The
PCR genotyping of non-transplanted mice with the three genotypes shown in the right panel
is the same as shown in Figure 1 B, and is reported here to illustrate the expected pattern
of BM with a mixed Mmp14wt/wt and Mmp14Y573D/Y573D genotype.
