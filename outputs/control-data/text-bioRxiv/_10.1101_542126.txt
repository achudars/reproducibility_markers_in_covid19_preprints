Impact of Prior Cancer on Outcomes in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Abstract
Background: Prior cancer is a common exclusion criterion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)
trials. However, whether a prior cancer diagnosis affects trial outcomes is still unknown. We
aimed to determine the impact of prior cancer on survival in NPC.
Methods: We identified patients diagnosed with NPC between 2004 and 2009 in the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Variables were compared by chi-squared test
and t-test as appropriate. Propensity score-adjusted Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional
hazard models were used to evaluate the impact of prior cancer on overall survival (OS).
Results: Among 3,131 eligible NPC patients, 349 (11.15%) patients had a history of prior cancer.
The Kaplan-Meier curves did not show a statistically significantly different OS (p=0.19).
Subgroup analyses stratified by timing of prior cancer and AJCC TNM stage of index cancer
displayed the same tendency, prior cancer didn’t adversely affect OS compared with patients
without prior cancer (p>0.05). Furthermore, in propensity score–adjusted COX models analysis,
patients with prior cancer had the same/non-inferior OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.12, 95%
confidence interval= 0.88 to 1.42).
Conclusions: Among patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, prior cancer does not convey an
adverse effect on clinical outcomes, regardless of the timing of prior cancer and AJCC TNM
stage of index cancer. Broader inclusion trial criteria could be adopted in nasopharyngeal

Introduction
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a head and neck cancer common in south China and
southeastern Asia(1). With the primary treatment of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, the
five-year overall survival (OS) of early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma is greater than 90%(2).
But recurrent or primary metastatic NPC still represents a critical unmet medical need in
oncology research. Despite Intensity-modulated radiation therapy significantly improves the
tumor local control rate, and distant metastasis is still poorly controlled, which remains the major
reason of treatment failure. Many large clinical trials have been conducted to seeking the
optimum comprehensive therapy to improve the survival, such as the standard first-line treatment
option

(gemcitabine

plus

cisplatin)

and

induction

chemotherapy

plus

concurrent

chemoradiotherapy for these patients(3,4).
Clinical trials are essential for better management of these patients. Fewer than five percent of
adults with cancer in the United States participate in clinical trials(5). Clinical trial eligibility
criteria present a major barrier to study enrollment, especially in oncology clinical trials, where
patients with a prior cancer diagnosis are frequently excluded(6). For instance, over 80% of lung
cancer trials sponsored by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) exclude patients
with prior cancer(7). This practice is mainly based on the long-held assumption that prior cancer
diagnosis and treatment could interfere with study outcomes. However, our previous pan-cancer
study suggested that not all prior cancers actually interfere with study outcomes(8). The number
of cancer survivors has a 4-fold increase in the United States over the last three decades(9). Due

to the improved survival of cancer patients, the prevalence of multiple primary cancer also
increases rapidly(10). Twenty-five percent of older adults and more than 10% of younger adults
diagnosed with cancer have a history of prior cancer(11). Given the increased number of cancer
survivors, the impact of this exclusion criteria will likely increase.
Until now, no study has specifically evaluating the impact of prior cancer on NPC outcomes,
and little is known about the characteristics of NPC patients with prior cancer. To address these
assumptions, we therefore determined the characteristics and prognostic impact of prior cancer
among patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) database.

Methods
Data source and population
We extracted data from the SEER database by using the SEER*Stat software version 8.3.5,
which covers approximately 30% of the population in the United States (https://seer.cancer.gov/,
accession number: 13693-Nov2015)(12,13).
The study population included patients diagnosed with NPC from January 2004 to December
2009. Patients who meet any of the following criteria were excluded from the study: (1) age at
diagnosis younger than 18 years; (2) patients with only autopsy or death certificate records; and
(3) patients with incomplete survival data and follow-up information.

We extracted demographic and clinicopathological data from SEER database, including sex,
age, race, marital status, pathology grade, TNM stage, surgery, and radiotherapy. We classified
race as white, black and others. Patients were divided into married or unmarried. The TNM stage
was based on the AJCC (6th edition) staging system. Considering that the survival data were
available in the measurement unit of months, a survival time of 0 month was recorded as 0.5
months to include patients who died within one month of diagnosis.
Measures
A history of prior cancer was determined from SEER sequence numbers, as described in our
previous study(8). In brief, sequence numbers represent the order of all primary reportable
neoplasms diagnosed in a lifetime. The timing of the prior cancer was calculated by using the
SEER diagnosis dates of the index cancer and the most recent of any prior cancers. Cases with
full timing records were used for further study. The primary outcome of this study was overall
survival. We set December 31, 2014 as the follow-up cutoff date to ensure that all included cases
were followed up for at least 5 years.
Statistical analysis
We categorized patients into two groups based on prior cancer history. Differences in patients’
characteristics were assessed by Pearson chi-squared analysis for categorical variables and t-test
for continuous variables as appropriate. In this study, we employed a propensity score matching
(PSM) method to minimize the effect of confounding from differences in baseline
characteristics(14). Propensity scores were calculated based on race, sex, age, marital status,

TNM stage, pathologic grade, and treatment. A one-to-one PSM with a caliper of 0.2 was
performed. The characteristics were balanced after PSM. These PSM pairs were used in
subsequent analyses.
OS was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were compared using
log-rank tests. Finally, we built a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to identify
whether prior cancer impacted the prognosis independently. The common demographic and
clinicopathological data, including race, sex, age, marital status, TNM stage, pathologic grade
and treatment, were entered as covariates. Statistical significance was set as a two-sided p-value
less than 0.05. Analyses were performed using R Statistical software (version 3.4.2, Institute for
Statistics and Mathematics, Vienna, Austria; www.r-project.org).

Results
In total, we identified 3,131 eligible NPC patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. Among
these cases, 11.15% (n=349) had a history of prior cancer. Compared with cases without previous
malignancies, patients with prior cancer were older (66.25 vs 54.59 years, p<0.001), female (37.0%
vs 29.5%, p=0.005), white (70.5% vs 48.5%, p<0.001), and unmarried (47.3% vs 40.7%). The
percentage of surgery was larger among patients with a prior cancer (15.8% vs 11.9%, p=0.047),
and patients with prior cancer received less radiotherapy (67.9% vs 80.1%, p<0.001). Additional
baseline characteristics are displayed in Table 1. Characteristics were balanced between groups
after adjustment for propensity score (Table 1, p > 0.05). Among 349 NPC patients with a history
of cancer, prostate (20.60%), gastrointestinal (13.73%), other genitourinary and gynecologic

(12.88%), and breast cancers (9.44%) were the most common types of prior cancer. Localized
and regional stages were accounting for 77.46% of cases. Over 60.52% of prior cancer were
diagnosed within 5 years of the index NPC. The median time between the most recent prior
cancer diagnosis and the index NPC was 3.5 years.
In unadjusted Kaplan–Meier analysis, NPC patients with prior cancer demonstrated similar OS
compared to patients without prior cancer (log rank tests p=0.19) (Figure 1). The overall
five-year survival rate for patients with or without prior cancer were 35.2% (95% confidence
interval (CI), 30.5–40.6) and 39.8% (95% CI, 35.0–45.4), respectively. Figure 2 depicts
Kaplan–Meier survival curves stratified by the timing of prior cancer and index cancer TNM
stage. Subgroup analyses stratified by timing of prior cancer and AJCC TNM stage of index
cancer displayed the same tendency, prior cancer didn’t adversely affect OS compared with
patients without prior cancer (p>0.05).
In propensity-score–adjusted Cox models, patients with prior cancer had the same/non-inferior
OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.12, 95% confidence interval= 0.88 to 1.42), compared to patients
without a prior cancer (Table 2).

Discussion
Stringent eligibility criteria for oncology clinical trials can minimize the risks to the
participants, but they can affect the accrual and external validity of clinical trial significantly(15).
In practice, patients with a prior cancer history are usually excluded in cancer clinical trials due to
the potential interference of study outcomes. But there is no authoritative data to this assumption

now. Given the sizeable number of cancer survivors, the impact of this criteria will increase, and
it is critical to understand the impact of prior cancer. Up to now, whether NPC patients with prior
cancer faced a worse prognosis remains unknown. Our study fills this knowledge gap exactly. We
observed that NPC patients with prior cancer did not result in inferior survival outcomes when
compared with those without prior cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the
characteristics and prognostic impact of prior cancer among NPC patients. Thus, we need to
rethink the long-held practices that patients with prior cancer are excluded from clinical trials.
Our previous study has mentioned the different impact of prior cancer according to the specific
cancer(8). We creatively divided these cancers into two categories, “prior cancer inferior” (PCI),
in which patients had lower survival rates than those without prior cancer; and “prior cancer
similar” (PCS), in which survival rates were similar. From this point of view, NPC is one kind of
PCS cancers. Several studies also addressed the same questions for other cancer types. Although
prior cancer might impact the overall survival in patients with prostate cancer(16), prior cancer
does not contribute to poor survival outcome in many other cancer types, such as lung,
glioblastoma, esophageal, gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic cancer(17-23). Notably, the impact of
prior cancer on early-stage, locally advanced and advanced lung cancer are consistent, without
adverse effect on clinical outcomes(17,18,20). Our results also confirmed similar phenomena in
different stage of NPC for the first time. It suggests that our findings are applicable to clinical
trials for different stages of NPC.

The timing of prior cancer is also needed to be fully considered when determining the impact
of prior cancer exclusion criteria on clinical trials(24). Generally, a 5-year exclusion window is
commonly employed in most trials(7), and over 60% of prior cancers occur within this window in
our study. The median interval between a prior cancer and the index NPC was 3.5 years. This
information indicated that active surveillance and screening for NPC is necessary in cancer
survivors. Subgroup analysis stratified by timing of prior cancer displayed the same tendency,
prior cancer did not adversely affect OS. In other words, the impact of prior cancer is independent
of timing. From this perspective, NPC patients with prior cancer can be considered for enrollment
in trials regardless of timing, and improve accrual without affecting outcomes.
However, there are several limitations in interpreting our study. Firstly, there is a paucity of
detailed characteristics about prior cancers diagnosed outside of the registry state, which are
recorded in sequence number only. So, our study only focused on the timing of the prior cancer.
Additionally, the efficacy and tolerability of therapy on prior cancer, which may disrupt the
management for the index cancer, cannot be considered due to the data restriction. Secondly, we
cannot obtain detailed data on treatments and comorbidities from the SEER database. Therefore,
neither did comorbidities be matched in our PSM analyses, nor did they are included in the
regression models. Thirdly, PSM analysis only accounts for observable covariates, and hidden
bias resulted from unobserved confounders remain after matching. Finally, the data obtained from
SEER cover approximately 34.6% of the total U.S. population, thus making it necessary to
confirm the generality of our findings.

Conclusions
Among patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, prior cancer does not convey an adverse
effect on clinical outcomes, regardless of timing of prior cancer and stage of index cancer.
Broader inclusion trial criteria could be adopted in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with a
history of prior cancer. However, further studies are warranted to confirm the appropriateness of
this exclusion criterion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma trials.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves of prior cancer impact on the overall survival
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
The overall survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was similar compared with that of patients
without a prior cancer (p>0.05).

Figure 2. Subgroup analysis of prior cancer impact on the overall survival stratified by the
timing of prior cancer and AJCC stage in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
The nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with prior cancer showed a similar survival when
compared with patients with no prior cancer, regardless of the timing of prior cancer and stage.
