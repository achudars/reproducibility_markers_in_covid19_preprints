ABSTRACT

12

The recent recrudescence of tuberculosis in cattle has implicated wild boar as a

13

reservoir and vector of this disease, which led to the investigation of fecal shedding of

14

the causative Mycobacterium bovis. In the Provence region of France, wild boars are

15

very abundant, and the current study was carried out to assess the presence of

16

tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria in feces of wild boar population. W e

17

developed an original protocol allowing the fast isolation of mycobacteria by

18

combining a 1%-chlorhexidine decontamination of fecal matter with culture on MOD9

19

medium. Colonies were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-

20

of-flight mass spectrometry, combined with DNA sequencing. This protocol yielded

21

no tuberculous mycobacteria among ninety-nine wild boar fecal samples collected in

22

the Provence region. However, non-tuberculous mycobacteria were isolated from five

23

samples (5.05%), including Mycobacterium peregrinum, Mycobacterium vaccae and

24

Mycobacterium setense, the last species being previously unreported in the wild

25

boar; in addition to two positive samples for Nocardia spp. In conclusion, wild boars

26

in southeastern France are not shedding tuberculosis agents, but they could

27

constitute a reservoir of human non-tuberculous mycobacteriosis in selected

28

populations directly exposed to wild boars.

INTRODUCTION

30

Bovine tuberculosis is a zoonosis due to Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) affecting

31

both livestock and wild mammals 1. Bovine tuberculosis is a contagious infection of

32

significant health and economic importance and eradication programs have been

33

implemented in a number of developed countries 1,2. These programs yielded a

34

remarkable reduction of the incidence of the disease 1,3.

35

However, the wide distribution of M. bovis in wildlife is a major obstacle to the

36

eradication of tuberculosis in cattle 2,3. In numerous countries, bovine tuberculosis is

37

maintained by multi-host systems involving cattle and wild mammals 2–4. While the

38

role of the red deer (Cervus elaphus) remains controversial 3, the European badger

39

(Meles meles) in Great Britain and Ireland and the wild boar (Sus scrofa) in the

40

Iberian Peninsula are acknowledged reservoirs for M. bovis 3,5. The later species is

41

also recognized as a host for other Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, including

42

Mycobacterium microti 6 and Mycobacterium caprae 7. In addition, non-tuberculous

43

mycobacteria that are widely distributed in the environment are not uncommon in wild

44

boars, where they were isolated from lymph nodes 8 and feces 9,10. These non-

45

tuberculous mycobacteria have been identified as emerging human pathogens,

46

especially in immunocompromised patients 11,12.

47

Accordingly, naturally infected wild boars excrete M. bovis mycobacteria by oro-

48

nasal and digestive routes, with inocula above 103 colony-forming units (CFU)/g 13.

49

Furthermore, it has been shown that M. bovis can persist in soil for several months14.

50

Interactions between M. bovis and soil-inhabiting amoebae may increase the lifespan

51

of mycobacteria, thus promoting their transmission throughout the environment15.

52

Humans and animals may then be contaminated not only by direct contact with

53

infected wild animals, as is the case for hunters handling carcasses16, but also from a

54

contaminated environment 9.

55

For epidemiological investigations and the diagnosis of tuberculosis in wild

56

animals, many techniques have been developed, including immunological,

57

serological and molecular biology techniques but culture remains the gold standard

58

technique for the diagnosis of tuberculosis mycobacteria infections 17. The lymph

59

nodes are the most frequently used sample for the research of mycobacteria in

60

animals 17-19 but this invasive sampling made by well trained staff, is almost limited to

61

dead animals. Therefore, the analysis of feces is an emerging method in wild animals

62

13,20-22

63

patients 23.

64

on the model of what has been reported for the routine diagnosis in human

In France, the first cases of tuberculosis in wild animals were detected in 2001 in

65

the Brotonne forest, Normandy 2. Then, monitoring programs for tuberculosis in wild

66

animals were applied and M. bovis was detected in badgers, wild boars, red deer, roe

67

deer and red fox in proximity areas of bovine tuberculosis outbreak4,19,22,24. One case

68

of tuberculosis was detected in a wild boar in Loir-et-Cher county which had

69

remained free from bovine tuberculosis for more than twenty years25. In Southeastern

70

France, there is a lack of information regarding the presence of tuberculosis and non-

71

tuberculous mycobacteria in wild boars, except for information from the national

72

surveillance system for tuberculosis in free-ranging wildlife (Sylvatub) which indicates

73

that wild animals collect in this area are negative 4 whereas one study carried-out by

74

serological methods that indirectly detected cases of M. bovis26.

75
76

Here, we investigated the presence and the shedding of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex and nontuberculous mycobacteria in feces of wild boars living

Results

80

Artificially-infected feces samples. Using NA-OH decontamination and culture on

81

Coletsos medium, PBS negative controls remained sterile whereas culture of non-

82

inoculated feces samples were invaded by contaminants. As for feces artificially

83

inoculated with M. bovis BCG for ten days, one culture was positive with seven

84

colonies of M. bovis BCG confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS in addition to contaminants,

85

the other two cultures were invaded by contaminants without presence colonies of M.

86

bovis BCG. The contaminants were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS as various Bacillus

87

species. Using chlorhexidine 1% decontamination and culture on MOD9 medium,

88

PBS negative controls and non-inoculated feces remained sterile. As for feces

89

artificially inoculated with 105 CFUs M. bovis BCG, non-frozen feces cultures yielded

90

the first colonies of M. bovis BCG after seven and nine days of incubation and more

91

than 100 colonies were observed after 20 days of incubation in one plate and 37

92

colonies in the second culture plate. Only one Sphingomonas paucimobilis

93

contaminant was observed on one of the two cultures. Feces artificially contaminated

94

and frozen at -20°C yielded M. bovis BCG colonies after nine-day incubation and

95

after twenty-day incubation and 12 colonies were counted in one plate and only four

96

on the second culture plate, in the absence of any contaminant. These data indicate

97

a sensitivity of 103 CFUs (fresh feces) and 104 CFUs (frozen feces) on MOD9

98

medium. This method of culture confirmed that feces artificially contaminated with

99

BCG were negative for mycobacteria.

102

8 days of incubation. Cultures obtained after one-month incubation were classified

103

into four types: plates containing pure cultures of mycobacteria (n=1); plates

104

containing mycobacteria mixed with contaminants (n=4); plates containing only

105

contaminants (n= 15) including two positive Nocardia spp. cultures; and negative-

106

culture plates (n= 79). No further colony was observed after three additional months

107

of incubation (for a total of four-month incubation). None of these 99 samples yielded

108

M. bovis, but non-tuberculous mycobacteria were cultivated in five samples which

109

corresponds to a rate of 5.05%. Mycobacterium vaccae was isolated in one feces

110

sample collected at military camp A, along with Mycobacterium peregrinumin in three

111

samples and Mycobacterium setense in one sample, collected at military camp B.

112

These mycobacteria were all identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and confirmed by partial

113

rpoB gene sequencing (Table 1). In addition, Nocardia rhamnosiphila was identified

114

by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in one sample collected at military camp A and one

115

Nocardia spp. isolate representative of a new Nocardia species in one sample

116

collected in camp B27. MALDI-TOF-MS identified contaminants as Pseudomonas

117

putida, Pandoraeasputorum, Ralstonia pickettii, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and

118

Sphingobacterium faeciuma long with a non-identified fungus.

DISCUSSION

121

Culture-based investigation of wild boar feces collected in two geographic areas in

122

the Provence region of France failed to find living tuberculous mycobacteria including

123

M. bovis. This observation was made after an original protocol of feces

124

decontamination and culture had been validated using the closely related M. bovis

125

BCG strain, in the presence of negative controls which remained negative.

126

Culture remains the reference method for the routine confirmation of mycobacterial

127

infection in animals1,28. The culture protocol herein described allows to detect an

128

inoculum of 103-104 CFUs M. bovis which is in the range of that extrapolated from

129

PCR-based observations in wild boars in Spain 15. However, contamination is a major

130

limitation of culturing feces. Here, we applied to animal feces a 1% chlorhexidine

131

decontamination and MOD9 medium culture protocol suitable for the recovery of

132

Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in patients on diagnosed with pulmonary

133

tuberculosis 29,30. Because the level of contamination of swine feces is very high, an

134

efficient decontamination protocol is essential to isolate and culture mycobacteria

135

from this type of sample20. In a first step, we validated this protocol using artificially

136

inoculated feces. Then, we applied it for the first time on animal specimens combined

137

with MOD9 medium protocol and found that this protocol was indeed suitable for the

138

recovery of living mycobacteria from wild boar feces. These results contrasted with

139

the standard NALC-NaOH decontamination and culture on Coletsos medium, which

140

yielded contaminants invading the culture tubes.

141

Moreover, we observed fewer colonies of M. bovis BCG when culturing frozen

142

feces compared to culturing fresh feces. The same observation was previously

143

reported regarding the decreased viability of M. bovis after freezing13, whereas no

144

effect of freezing at -20°C was reported when culturing M. tuberculosis from sputum

145

specimens collected in patients31. As for feces, the recommendation is to cultivate

146

fresh feces collected in cattle within less than 96 hours for the isolation and culture of

147

M. avium 21.

148

The 1% chlorhexidine decontamination and MOD9 culture protocol enabled the

149

isolation of three non-tuberculous mycobacteria from five different wild boars with a

150

prevalence of 5.05%, in the range of the previously reported 0% to 11.1% prevalence

151

of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in wild boar faeces10. In the lymph nodes,

152

prevalence is 16.8% in Spain8 whereas no mycobacteria could be detected in lymph

153

nodes in another study in Poland 32 the prevalence of mycobacteria in wild boar

154

varies among wild boar population, density and environment. M. vaccae was initially

155

cultivated from cows in Austria 33 and has previously been isolated in wild boars in

156

Australia 9. M. vaccae is often considered a non-pathogenic mycobacterium 34 and

157

has even been proposed as a vaccine for the treatment of multiresistant

158

tuberculosis35. However, cases of pulmonary and skin infections have been

159

described in human diseases12,33. Furthermore, rpoB gene sequencing confirmed the

160

result obtained by MALDI-TOF and unambiguously 36 distinguished M. peregrinum

161

from the closely related M. septicum. Indeed, the species are not differentiated by

162

16S rRNA gene sequencing36. In animals, M. peregrinum has been described as an

163

etiological agent of mycobacteriosis in farmed fish 37 was recently isolated in wild

164

boar from Slovenia18. It is an opportunistic pathogen previously implicated in surgical

165

site infections and catheter-related infections 12,38 . Regarding M. setense isolated

166

here in one wild boar from military camp B, it has been described for the first time as

167

being responsible for osteitis 39,40. Furthermore, three cases have been reported in

168

Italy 12 and Iran 41. We report here on the first isolation of M. setense in wild boars. M.

169

peregrinum and M. setense are two members of the Mycobacterium fortuitum

170

complex, which is including rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacteria 40

171

distributed in the aquatic environment 18,42. This may suggest the presence of these

172

mycobacteria in the aquatic environments frequented by the wild boar at military

173

camp B.

174
175

Moreover, the original culture protocol reported here allowed isolating two species
of Nocardia. The first isolate was definitely identified as N. rhamnosiphila by 16S

rRNA gene sequencing. This species, initially identified from a compost mound

177

sample in South Africa 43 has never been reported in animals and not in the humans.

178

The second isolate here referred as Nocardia strain S-137 is a representative of a

179

hitherto undescribed species: this isolate exhibited a non-identifying MALDI-TOF-MS

180

spectrum, along with a 16S rRNA gene sequence exhibiting only 98% sequence

181

similarity with N. brasiliensis strain FDAARGOS. Draft genome sequence and in

182

silico DNA-DNA hybridization confirmed strain Nocardia S-137 as representative of a

183

new species “Nocardia suismassiliense” 27.

184

While the general population is not routinely exposed to wild boars, some selected

185

populations chiefly hunted, are exposed in such way that wild boars do constitute the

186

reservoir of zoonoses, as illustrated by the demonstration of cross-transmission of

187

hepatitis E virus from wild boars to patients in our region 44,45.

188

In conclusion, we found no evidence for living Mycobacterium tuberculosis

189

complex, including M. bovis, in the feces of wild boars collected during 2015/2016

190

hunting season in the Provence region of France whereas other actinomycetes

191

including non-tuberculous mycobacteria, were easily cultured. The decontamination-

192

culture protocol reported here can be used for routine, culture-based detection of

193

mycobacteria and related bacteria in wild boar feces samples, a source of previously

194

undescribed microorganisms.

201

France) (43°15’02.1’’North; 5°30’23.6’’East). All samples, collected directly from the

202

animal rectum by hunters were stored at -20 °C until cultured at the latest eight

203

months after collection. No animals were killed specifically for this study and this work

204

did not require animal experiment ethics approval.

205

Artificially contaminated feces specimens. M. bovis strain BCG was grown at

206

37°C on Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Becton Dickinson, Pont de Claix, France)

207

supplemented with oleic-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC) (Becton Dickinson). The

208

colonies were suspended in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then rigorously

209

vortexed using 3-mm sterile glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier,

210

France) and passed five times through a 25-G needle to disperse clustered cells. The

211

homogenized suspensions were then calibrated at 107 CFU/mL by using optical

212

density at 580 nm (Cell Density Meter; Fisher Scientific, Illkirch, France) and

213

calibration curve. Feces of wild boar were inoculated with the suspension of M. bovis

214

BCG to a final concentration 106 CFU/g. The artificially contaminated samples were

215

separated into two batches, the first left at room temperature for four hours and the

216

second being frozen at -20°C for one month in order to verify the viability of

217

mycobacteria in frozen feces. The artificially infected samples were then

218

decontaminated using two decontamination methods and cultured using two different

219

culture media, in order to determine the more efficient culture method.

volume was completed to 50 mL with a neutralization solution based on a phosphate

226

buffer and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was decanted, 1 mL

227

of sterile PBS was added and 250 μL of the pellet-PBS suspension was inoculated,

228

in triplicate, in Coletsos medium (bioMérieux, Craponne, France). PBS and non-

229

inoculated feces were used in parallel as controls for culture to survey for cross-

230

contamination and all tubes were incubated at 37°C.

231

Decontamination with chlorhexidine 1% and culture in MOD9 medium. The

232

MOD9 culture medium was prepared as previously described 29,30. Briefly, MOD 9

233

culture medium incorporates for a total volume of 1.000 mL, 5 g of lecithin, 19 g of

234

Middlebrook 7H10 powder, one gram of yeast extract, two grams of glucose, one

235

gram of pancreatic digest of casein, 5 mL of glycerol and 2 mL of Tween 80. All

236

compounds were dissolved in 669 mL of distilled water and the mixture was

237

autoclaved at 121°C for 20 min. Then 150 mL of lamb serum, 100 mL OADC (oleic

238

acid albumin, dextrose, catalase), 20 mL of growth supplement (Becton Dickinson),

239

50 mL of antibiotic mixture solution (5 mg of vancomycin, 6,000 units of polymyxin B,

240

600 mg of amphotericin B, 2,400 mg of nalidixic acid, 600 mg of trimethoprim and

241

600 mg of azlocillin), 4 mL of red food colouring and 0.1g of ascorbic acid were

242

added after the medium was cooled to 55°C. This culture medium has been specially

243

designed for the culture-based recovery of mycobacteria including Mycobacterium

244

tuberculosis complex. Decontamination with 1% chlorhexidine was performed

245

according to 46 modified by adding filtration as described below. About 1 g of

246

experimentally contaminated feces was deposited into a 50 mL-tube containing 3-mm

247

sterile glass beads, and the volume was completed to 5 mL with sterile PBS. The

248

tube was vortexed and the suspension was filtered with 40 µm cell strainer to remove

volume of 1% chlorhexidine, vortexed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature

251

with continuous agitation. The remaining volume was completed to 50 mL with PBS

252

and centrifuged at 3000 X g for 20 min. The supernatant was then decanted, 1 mL of

253

sterile PBS was added, and 100 μL of the pellet-PBS suspension were inoculated, in

254

duplicate, in MOD9 medium. PBS and non-inoculated feces were used in parallel as

255

a negative control for culture to survey for cross contamination, and all plates were

256

incubated at 37°C. This method was further used on to decontaminate and inoculate

257

99 wild boar feces samples, including 79 samples collected at military camp A, and

258

20 samples collected at military camp B.

259

Artificially contaminated feces culture. The cultures were observed regularly and

260

M. bovis strain BCG colonies were counted and identified with the matrix-assisted

261

laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) on a

262

Microflex spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) 47,48 . Briefly, one loop-

263

full of colonies was removed from the culture and directly applied to the plate and

264

mixed with matrix. For each colony, three different spots were deposited on the mass

265

spectrometer plate and the manipulation was repeated after subculture. The protein

266

profiles were visualized using FlexControl 3.3 software (Bruker Daltonik) and

267

analyzed by the program FlexAnalysis 3.3 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen,

268

Germany).

temperature. An initial identification was carried out with MALDI-TOF-MS as

272

previously described 47,48 . Colonies which remained not identified by MALDI-TOF-

273

MS, were stained by the Ziehl-Neelsen method and examined by using light

microscopy. Ziehl-Neelsen-positive colonies were subsequently identified by

Ethics approval and consent to participate

305

No Ethics or use committee approval was required since the samples of faeces were

306

collected at a slaughterhouse, on wild boars already killed during hunting according

307

to procedures officially approved by the French authorities (rifle shooting with large

308

caliber bullets) and by authorized hunters. The hunt was not organized for the

309

purpose of sample collection; no animal was killed in the perspective of the present

310

study.
