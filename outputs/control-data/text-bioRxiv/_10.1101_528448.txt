Abstract
1. Seed dispersal distances (SDD) critically influence

the survival of seedlings, spatial patterns

25

of genetic diversity within plant populations and gene flow among plant populations. In

26

tropical forests, a large percentage of seeds is dispersed by animals, and their foraging

27

behaviour and movement patterns determine SDD. Direct observations of seed dispersal

28

events by animals in natural plant populations are mostly constrained by the high mobility and

29

low visibility of their vectors. Therefore, diverse alternative methods are used to estimate

30

SDD, but direct comparisons of these approaches within the same seed dispersal system are

31

mostly missing.

32

2. In this study, we take advantage of two plant species with

different life history traits, Leonia

33

cymosa and Parkia panurensis that are exclusively dispersed by two tamarin species,

34

Saguinus mystax and Leontocebus nigrifrons (Callitrichidae) at our study site in the Peruvian

35

Amazon. We compare SDD estimates obtained from direct observations, genetic identification

36

of mother plants from seed coats, parentage analysis of seedlings, and modelling approaches,

37

including the combination of movement data and gut passage times and individual-based

38

modelling.

39

3. We detect differences between SDD estimates that can be linked to the processes relevant at

40

different phases of the seed dispersal loop covered by the respective approaches. Despite these

41

differences, SDD estimates for P. panurensis are consistently lower than for L. cymosa which

42

is likely related to differences in fruit characteristics and fruit abundance, factors that

43

influence gut passage time, foraging behaviour and movement patterns of the tamarins.

44

4. Our comparisons allow setting SDD estimates from studies using different methodological

45

approaches into the seed dispersal loop context, thus improving comparability of

46

methodologically different studies and method applicability.

Introduction

50

Seed dispersal provides the spatial template for subsequent processes that ultimately result in the

51

recruitment of new individuals in plant populations. It impacts seed survival (Janzen, 1970; Connell,

52

1971; Schupp, Jordano, & Gómez, 2010; Schupp & Jordano, 2011; Steinitz, Troupin, Vendramin, &

53

Nathan, 2011), determines gene flow within and among populations (Cain, Milligan, & Strand, 2000;

54

Ran Nathan et al., 2008; He, Lamont, Krauss, & Enright, 2010), fosters habitat connectivity (Culot,

55

Lazo, Huynen, Poncin, & Heymann, 2010; Lindsell, Lee, Powell, & Gemita, 2015; Ripperger, Kalko,

56

Rodriguez-Herrera, Mayer, & Tschapka, 2015) and enhances the probability of survival of populations

57

under anthropogenic pressure (Snyder, 2011; McConkey et al., 2012; Ruxton & Schaefer, 2012;

58

Abedi-Lartey, Dechmann, Wikelski, Scharf, & Fahr, 2016). Measuring the seed dispersal distance

59

(SDD), i.e. the distance between the source plant of a seed and its deposition site, is crucial for

60

determining the spatial dimension of the seed shadow and predicting the outcomes of the processes

61

following seed dispersal (Nathan & Muller-landau, 2000; Nathan, Klein, Robledo-Arnuncio, &

62

Revilla, 2012).

63

Different approaches have been employed to estimate SDD and seed shadows, each having its specific

64

benefits and limitations (Table 1). Naturally, the method of choice depends on the specific study

65

system and the resources available. Nathan et al. (2012) describe different methods to estimate seed

66

dispersal kernels, comparing limitations and uses, however, direct comparisons between methods

67

within the same seed dispersal system are scarce. Mise et al. (2016) compared seed dispersal distances

68

estimates for racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) using the bait-marker method against the

69

combination of movement data and gut passage, and found comparable results when data was

70

collected from the same region. For the Neotropical legume Parkia panurensis, the matching of

71

genotypes of seed coats to potential maternal trees was confirmed with SDD obtained through direct

72

observation of seed dispersal vectors (Heymann et al., 2012). Spatially explicit modelling based on

73

movement data from the same vectors, but from an independent study, further supported these findings

74

(Bialozyt, Flinkerbusch, Niggemann, & Heymann, 2014). Using different methods for determining

75

SDD within the same study system allows for an evaluation of the comparability between results from

76

different methods, most important when deriving conclusions for seed dispersal systems based on

77

different studies applying different methods. Using primate-dispersed plants for such a comparison is

78

particularly useful since primates, once habituated, can be followed for direct observations of seed

79

dispersal events. Thereby, the position of feeding plants and seed dispersal sites can be recorded, an

80

approach rarely feasible with birds, bats, and other highly mobile vectors. Finally, this comparison

81

provides valuable information on which method to choose when direct observations are not possible

82

because the target plant species of a study system fails to produce fruits. Such phenological changes

83

may become increasingly more frequent as a consequence of global climate change (Cleland, Chuine,

84

Menzel, Mooney, & Schwartz, 2007; Abernethy, Bush, Forget, Mendoza, & Morellato, 2018) and

85

make it increasingly harder to plan field studies on seed dispersal. For example, in our specific case,

86

after years of high fruiting yield, the population of L. cymosa at our study site produced a deficient

87

number of fruits during our sampling years, leading us to rely on alternative methods for estimating

88

SDD.

89

In this paper, we compared different approaches for estimating SDD and seed dispersal curves. We

90

used data from the previous studies on P. panurensis (Heymann et al., 2012; Bialozyt, Flinkerbusch, et

91

al., 2014) where SDD had already been estimated based on direct observation of seed dispersal events,

92

maternal identification through genotyping of seed coats and individual-based modelling, and added

93

SDD estimates based on two additional approaches. We replicated these five approaches for L.

94

cymosa, which is dispersed by the same vectors as P. panurensis, but for which we obtained only

95

few direct observations due to unexpected low fruit production. Therefore, for both species, we

96

compare SDD estimates based on five methods: (1) observed seed dispersal events (OSD), (2) seed

97

dispersal estimates from maternal identification through genotyping of seed coats (GSC), (3)

98

parentage analysis of seedlings (PAS), (4) modelling of SDD through a combination of movement

99

data with gut passage times (CMG), and (5) simulation of seed dispersal by individual-based

100

modelling (IBM). Apart from the methodological comparison, our analysis also allows comparing the

101

effect of plant traits on SDD without the potentially confounding effect of different dispersal vectors.

Materials and Methods

103

Study site

104

Data for this paper were collected at the Estación Biológica Quebrada Blanco (EBQB), located at

105

4°21’S 73°09’W in north-eastern Peruvian Amazonia. For details of the study area, see Heymann

106

(1995) and Culot et al. (2010).

107

Plant species

108

We use data from two different plant species, Leonia cymosa (Violaceae) and Parkia panurensis

109

(Fabaceae) for our comparisons. Leonia cymosa is an understory tree and occurs at an adult population

110

density of 5 and 11 individuals/ha within the home ranges of the investigated tamarin groups at

111

EBQB. It produces berries with 2-7 seeds embedded in a fibrous pulp. During weekly counts, 25-125

112

fruits were present per tree in a previous study (Reinehr, 2010). Fruits ripen asynchronously within

113

and between trees throughout several weeks, up to three months. Feeding visits by tamarins vary

114

between <1 and 10 min (mean: 1.9 min; SE: 0.1), with generally only 1-2 (maximum 5) tamarins

115

feeding in a single tree (Reinehr, 2010). On average tamarins visit 7.5 trees per day (range: 1-14 and

116

generally feed in several L. cymosa individuals in a row (Reinehr, 2010). This “trap-lining” (Garber,

117

1988) makes it challenging to assign seeds to a source tree during the observation of seed dispersal

118

events.

119

Parkia panurensis is a canopy tree and occurs at a density of around one adult/ha. It produces pods

120

with 15-25 seeds surrounded by an edible sticky gum (Hopkins, 1986) Within a single tree, ripe pods

121

may be present for up to 12 weeks, within the population for up to ca. 4 months. Feeding visits of

122

tamarins’ range between 3 and 46 min (mean: 11.8 min; SE: 0.7), depending on the number of ripe

123

pods available at a given moment, and generally, all group members are feeding simultaneously in a

124

single tree (Heymann, pers. obs.; Feldmann, 2000). Tamarins may visit the same tree up to four times

125

per day, and there is no trap-lining. Therefore, seeds can very often be reliably assigned to a single

126

source tree (Heymann et al., 2012).

127

Seed dispersal vectors

128

At EBQB, the seeds of both plant species are exclusively dispersed by two species of tamarin

129

monkeys, Saguinus mystax and Leontocebus nigrifrons (Callitrichidae). These primates live in groups

130

of 3-12 individuals and form mixed-species troops in which members from both species move through

131

a shared home range in a highly coordinated way (Heymann & Buchanan-Smith, 2007). Home range

132

size varies between ca. 25 and 50 ha and mean daily path length (i.e. the length of the route travelled

133

from sleeping site to sleeping site) ranges from 600 - 3,000 m (mean: 1,700 m; Smith, 1997). Daily

134

travel paths are not linear but have variable shapes (e.g., concentric, meandering; see Supplementary

135

Information 1 for examples).

136

Collection of observational data

137

Tamarin groups at EBQB are well-habituated to the presence of human observers and can be observed

138

at close range. Data on feeding and seed dispersal of L. cymosa and P. panurensis are available from

139

studies by Knogge (1999), Culot (2009) and Heymann et al. (2012). They include location and time of

140

feeding and defecation of both tamarin species. Defecations containing one or more seeds were

141

defined as seed dispersal events (Knogge & Heymann, 2003). Movement data of tamarin groups,

142

independent of seed dispersal events, were recorded for a total of 62 days, with a mean of 7.7 ± 2.8

143

days per month from December 2012 to July 2013. Position data were recorded with GPS devices or

144

previous to GPS devices (1999) determined in reference to the 100 m x 100 m grid system and in

145

reference to previously marked and mapped trees at EBQB.

146

Sampling of plant material

147

We collected leaf samples from L. cymosa seedlings (height <100 cm), juveniles (100-250 cm) and

148

adult plants (>250 cm) in 2014. We exhaustively sampled all plants in a total of 25 quadrats of 50 m x

149

50 m) within the home range of tamarin group 1 (12 quadrats ~ 15 % of home-range area) and 2 (13

150

quadrats ~ 15 % of home-range area). Quadrats were located at the crossings of the trail system that

151

spans the study site (Figure 1). To increase the number of adults, we additionally sampled along 53

152

transects of 15 m x 100 m in Group 1 and additional quadrats on remaining path intersections in Group

2. Finally, when the trees were fruiting in 2016, we collected seeds of L. cymosa that were excreted by

154

tamarins, stored them in saline solution and recorded

155

analysis, we either dried the sampled leaf tissue on silica gel beads or soaked Whatman FTA

156

Plantsaver cards (GE Healthcare Lifesciences, Chicago, IL, USA) with smashed leaf material (see

157

Supporting information S1).

158

A full inventory of adult P. panurensis (dbh >20 cm) was done within the home range of tamarin

159

Group 1 (Bialozyt, Luettmann, et al., 2014). Geographic coordinates were recorded with a GPS device

160

(Garmin GPSMap 76CSx). Seedlings (height <1.3 m) and juveniles (height >1.3 m and dbh <20 cm)

161

of P. panurensis were sampled by randomly overlaying a 50 m x 50 m grid over a map of the home

162

range of tamarin Group 1. Intersections of this grid were taken as central points for 50 m x 50 m

163

quadrants were seedlings and juveniles were sampled exhaustively.

164

Genotyping with microsatellite markers

165

To prepare the leaf samples of seedlings and adult trees for DNA extraction, we ground the leaves

166

using a Retsch mill (Haan, Germany). Seeds were first rehydrated at room temperature, and then seed

167

coats were carefully separated from the embryo. We dried the seed coats (i.e. maternal tissue) on filter

168

paper and ground them in the Retsch mill. DNA was extracted from ground leaves and seed coats

169

following the modified CTAB protocol with ATMAB (Dumolin, Demesure, & Petit, 1995). DNA of

170

each sample was genotyped using eleven nuclear microsatellites for L. cymosa following

171

described in Supplementary data 2. For P. panurensis we used genotype information of 33 adults and

172

85 seedlings and 92 seeds that were previously genotyped with nine nuclear microsatellite markers

(Heymann et al., 2012).

178 II.

Maternal identification from genotyping of seed coats (GSC)

179

The seed coat is of maternal origin, and thus a precise match between the genotype of a seed coat and

180

potential mother trees would identify the right mother. Genotypes from seed coats were matched to

181

adult genotypes using GenAlex v. 6.501 with no mismatches allowed (Peakall & Smouse, 2006).

182

Euclidean distance between the source tree and the dispersed seed was determined based on the

183

recorded UTM coordinates.

184 III.

Parentage analysis of seedlings (PAS)

185

We used the CERVUS software v3.0.7 (Slate, Marshall, & Pemberton, 2000) to determine the

186

potential parents for the genotyped seedlings in our study area. We selected strict confidence intervals

187

(95%) for the parental analyses using maximum likelihood framework. We run the preliminary

188

simulation with the following parameters settings: number of candidate parents was set to 202 for

189

L. cymosa and 33 for P. panurensis, proportion sampled set to 0.15 for L. cymosa based on sampling

190

areas in relation to the total home range area and 0.99 for P. panurensis were we are confident that all

191

adult trees in the tamarins´ home range were sampled. Finally, the genotyping error was determined as

192

0.01 using GenAlex, and we only included individuals with a minimum of six typed loci for L. cymosa

193

and five for P. panurensis.

194

parents and offspring.

195

Given that maternal sources of seedlings and juveniles were unknown in L. cymosa and P. panurensis,

196

we assumed that both parents could be either mother or father to avoid potential bias. Following this

197

assumption, we used all possible parent-seedling combinations to calculate a mean SDD and density

198

distance kernels. As observations of seed dispersal events showed that seed dispersal distances by

199

tamarins do not exceed 709 m (N=1884; Knogge, 1998) which corresponds to the diameter of a

200

tamarin home range, we excluded seedling-parent pairs at distances > 709 m from this analysis

201

assuming that this is instead a pollen source than a seed source.

Afterwards, we determined the Euclidean distance between the resulting

202 IV.

Combination of movement data with gut passage time estimate (CMG)

203

To determine seed dispersal distances based on daily travel paths of dispersal vectors we modified the

204

approach used by Murray (1988). Linear distances between scan points were calculated for each daily

205

travel path, considering the time interval between each pair of scan points (Figure 1). We created a

206

function in R, linear.distances(), (see supporting information S2) to automatically extract the

207

information from movement data collected in 2013. From the movement data, we obtained a series of

208

linear distances for time intervals from 30 min up to 9 hours for each day. In contrast to Murray´s

209

approach, we did not limit the analysis to scan points after visits to food plants. Thus, our method is

210

also applicable under conditions where no information on the timing of feeding is available, e.g. in

211

cases where animals are tracked remotely.

212

In a next step, we only considered linear distances within the time interval of gut passage for the seeds

213

of each species. We estimated gut passage time as the time lag between feeding and defecation (from

214

data collected by Knogge, 1998 and Culot, 2009). Since resting times can increase gut passage time

215

without increasing seed dispersal distance, we used a conservative range with the upper limit within

216

80% confidence interval (CI) and the lower limit within 5% CI of passage times, calculated with the

217

function npquantile() from the “np” package (Hayfield and Racine, 2008) for skewed distributions.

218

The resulting gut passage time estimate for Parkia panurensis was 0:30-4:00 hrs (N=196). For L.

219

cymosa we had only

220

resulting in a gut passage time estimate of 2:00-4:00 hrs (N=3).

221

To account for monthly variation of travel path length, we only considered the fruiting periods for

222

each species (May - July for P. panurensis and Mar to May for L. cymosa). With this subset of

223

potential seed dispersal events, we plotted the density distance kernel using the bkde() function from

224

the “KernSmooth” package following suggestions by Deng & Wickham (2011). For each method, we

225

decided the bandwidth for the density curve based on the function density().

Individual-based modelling of seed dispersal events (IBM)

227

Individual-based modelling (IBM) provides another approach to assess SDD. In such a model, the

228

tamarins move around and eat fruits in order to maintain homeostasis and as a result disperse seeds

229

after a predefined gut passage time somewhere within their home range. Bialozyt et al. (2014a)

230

developed such a model P. panurensis at the same study site and for the same tamarin home range. In

231

their model, they used three different tree types: feeding, resting and sleeping trees. In the model, only

232

those P. panurensis trees in the home-range area that were used as actual feeding trees during the

233

observation period in 2008 were considered and – for the purpose of the simulation – it was assumed

234

that there were no other species used for feeding. This assumption was valid for these simulations

235

because the data collection had been carried out during a timespan when P. panurensis was nearly the

236

exclusive fruit source for the tamarins.

237

In the current paper, we adjusted the previous model for the seed dispersal scenario of L. cymosa.

238

Thus, we needed to adjust four critical aspects. First, since L. cymosa is never the only fruit source

239

available in this area, we needed to add other species as fruit source to allow for enough energy input

240

during the daily routine of the tamarins. We used the other species of feeding trees observed during L.

241

cymosa’s fruiting season in 2013 as additional fruit sources. Furthermore, not all L. cymosa trees fruit

242

yearly; therefore, we used the subset of L. cymosa trees (N = 8) observed that same year. Second, L.

243

cymosa contains 415-642 mg of soluble sugars per g dry matter, whereas P. panurensis contains 811

244

mg/g (Pfrommer, 2009; Peres, 2010); therefore, we adjusted the mean energy level provided by the

245

trees in the simulation model. Third, different time intervals in feeding trees for a single feeding event

246

were implemented for P. panurensis and L. cymosa (Table S4.5) to reflect the respective fruit crop

247

sizes and the resulting shorter feeding times in L. cymosa. Fourth, we adjusted gut passage time for L.

248

cymosa according to field observations of seed dispersal events reported by Knogge (1999) and Culot

249

(2009). All other parameters were kept at values of the P. panurensis simulation (Bialozyt et al.

250

2014a).

251

Simulations of daily movements were carried out for 200 days to get enough L. cymosa seed dispersal

252

events. We then determined the Euclidian distance between dispersed seeds and their mother trees.

Details on the simulation model are presented in Bialozyt et al. (2014a), and changes to the original

254

model are provided in supporting information S4 (Table S4.1).

255

Statistical analysis of seed dispersal distance

256

We estimated mean SDD values for each method through bootstrapping distance values (n = 10,000

257

resamplings), using the boot_mean() function from the “boot” package in R (Davison & Hinkley,

258

1997; Canty & Ripley, 2017). We evaluated differences between methods and species with the non-

259

parametric Kruskal-Wallis test using the kruskal.test() function from the stats package in R (R Core

260

Team, 2018). We did further posthoc comparisons with the non-parametric multiple comparison test

261

and Bonferroni corrections, using the pairwise.wilcox.test() function, from the stats package in R (R

262

Core Team, 2018).

263

To estimate seed dispersal curves, we determined the empirical frequency distribution (i.e. density

264

distance kernels) of dispersal distances for each method by adjusting a non-parametric function

265

(smooth spline curve) and its confidence envelope estimated by bootstrapping (n = 100 resamplings)

266

using the mykernel() function (Jordano, 2016). Bandwidth size was calculated with the function

267

density() from the “stats” package (R Core Team, 2018).

268

Finally, to compare seed dispersal curves between methods we estimated the probability distribution

269

of all methods using the stat_ecdf() function from the “ggplot2” package in R (Wickham, 2016).

270

Subsequently, we tested differences between the empirical cumulative distribution functions of each

271

method with the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which is sensitive to differences in both

272

location and shape of the cumulative distribution function. For the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we used

273

the ks.test() function from the package “stats” in R (R Core Team, 2018).

Comparison among methods

276

Depending on the method used, mean SDD estimates range between 158 and 201 m for P. panurensis

277

and between 178 and 318 m (30% difference) for L. cymosa. Overall, methods varied significantly in

278

the resulting SDD estimates (P. panurensis: H(4) = 13.7, p = 0.009; L. cymosa: H(4) = 17.3, p = 0.002).

279

Specifically, Wilcoxon pairwise comparisons revealed that SDD estimates from IBM were

280

significantly higher than those from OSD and GSC, and SDD estimates from CMG were significantly

281

higher than those from GSC, in P. panurensis (Fig. 2a) and SDD estimates from PAS were

282

significantly lower than those from GSC, CMG and IBM in L. cymosa (Fig. 2b).

283

For P. panurensis, all methods except for IBM provide a strongly significant right-skewed distribution

284

of SDD OSD, GSC, and CMG (Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test: p=0.02, p=0.03, p=0.002, respectively)

285

(Fig. 3a). Furthermore, in P. panurensis, the cumulative SDD curves of all methods converge at low

286

distances, (Fig. S3.4a). In L. cymosa, the shape of the SDD distributions was highly variable on results

287

from methods executed with small sample number, and only the curve based on PAS approaches a

288

right-skewed pattern while the others show a trend towards normality. PAS curve was significantly

289

more left-skewed than GSC, CMG, and IBM (Kolmogorov -Smirnoff test, p=0.03, p<0.001, and

290

p<0.001, respectively) (Fig.3b)

291

Comparison between species

292

SDD estimates varied significantly between P. panurensis and L. cymosa (H(4) = 557.5, p < 0.001).

293

Specifically, Wilcoxon pairwise comparisons revealed that estimates obtained through GSC, CMG

294

and IBM differed significantly with higher SDD for L. cymosa (Fig S3.5).

295

Discussion

296

Our analyses revealed that different methods resulted in different SDD estimates for two Neotropical

297

rainforest tree species. Each method refers to different processes within the “seed dispersal loop”

298

described by Wang and Smith (2002, Fig 4), which could explain part of the differences. For example,

299

while OSD estimates SDD after step 2 of the seed dispersal loop including the resulting seed

300

deposition, CMG measures SDD at step 2 of the seed dispersal loop without including seed deposition,

301

therefore giving only an estimate of all potential seed dispersal distances. IBM integrates over steps 1

302

and 2, providing a range of simulated seed dispersal distances based on possible case scenarios

303

deriving from only these two steps. PAS, instead, estimates SDD after step 4 (and eventually step 5).

13
304

Therefore, it includes also germination success and post-dispersal processes, which might lead to

305

lower or higher estimates according to plant-specific density-dependent mortality (Fig. 4).

306

However, different positions within the seed dispersal loop may not explain the fact that different

307

methods provide lower vs higher estimates in an inconsistent way for different species. Here, we

308

explore how these inter-specific inconsistent differences between methods could be related to different

309

life histories, species-specific interactions with seed dispersers and post-dispersal processes in the two

310

plant species. In the case of P. panurensis, differences between methods only concerned the median

311

SDD, but not the overall distribution of SDD which was consistent and showed a right-skewed pattern

312

that seems to be typical for SDD distributions (Clark, Silman, Kern, Macklin, & HilleRisLambers,

313

1999; Nathan et al., 2008). In contrast, for L. cymosa not only median SDD differed between methods,

314

but also the overall SDD distributions, where most curves deviated from the right-skewed pattern

315

showing normality and even slight bi-modality, except for the curve based on PAS. Even though for

316

the curves based on OSD and GSC, the minimal sample size could play a role on this difference, a

317

right-skewed curve for the only method including germination success could potentially imply a high

318

germination success of undispersed seeds near source trees.

319

Our results indicate that comparisons between studies need to carefully evaluate the differences among

320

methods for estimating SDD. On the other hand, a combination of methods can be used to obtain more

321

information on the seed dispersal system, when considering the different steps of the seed dispersal

322

loop taken into account by each method.

323

Reliable estimates of gut passage time are crucial for modelling SDD with the CMG method. In both

324

tamarin species, gut passage times show considerable variation within and between plant species

325

(Knogge, 1999). Therefore, the higher the sample size of gut passage times, the more reliable the

326

results obtained from this method. However, our results show that even a small sample size for gut

327

passage times results in similar SDD estimated obtained from CMG and IBM. An alternative to field

328

observations of gut passage times are estimates derived from captive animals. A number of studies

329

estimated gut passage times (or regurgitation times) from captive feeding experiments with one or few

330

plant species and then extrapolated to other plant species to estimate SDD (Holbrook & Smith, 2000;

331

Westcott, Bentrupperbäumer, Bradford, & McKeown, 2005; Holbrook, 2011; Abedi-Lartey et al.,

332

2016). It remains to be determined how representative these results from captive animals are, as

333

restriction of movements affects gut motility (Holdstock, Misiewicz, Smith, & Rowlands, 1970;

334

Oettlé, 1991). For example, gut passage time of seeds increased by up to 80% with physical activity in

335

mallards (Kleyheeg, van Leeuwen, Morison, Nolet, & Soons, 2015). Studies of primate seed dispersal

336

are “privileged” as gut passage times can be determined from unconstrained, naturally moving animals

337

(Bravo, 2009.; Knogge, 1999; Wehncke, Hubbell, Foster, & Dalling, 2003; Valenta & Fedigan, 2010)

338

which is mostly not feasible in birds, and impossible for nocturnal bats. Yet, in these taxa, remote

339

tracking of animals via GPS telemetry is becoming increasingly feasible with new and smaller

340

tracking devices (Abedi-Lartey et al., 2016; McMahon et al., 2017; Oleksy, Giuggioli, McKetterick,

341

Racey, & Jones, 2017) that allows tracking of small to medium-sized seed dispersers. These devices

342

allow obtaining data of daily travel paths that will provide fine-tuned estimates of SDD using the CDG

343

method if reliable data of gut passage time is available.

344

Despite the uncertainty of gut passage time in L. cymosa it is plausible to assume that gut passage

345

times are longer for L. cymosa compared to P. panurensis. In the former, the fibrous pulp is firmly

346

attached to the seeds, in contrast to the gelatinous exudate in the latter, and Knogge (1999) showed

347

that seeds with fibrous pulp produce longer gut passage times than seeds with gelatinous pulp. So even

348

if tamarin movement patterns were identical when feeding on these two species, the longer gut passage

349

time would increase SDD. Also, movement patterns and foraging behaviour of tamarins differ when

350

feeding in L. cymosa and P. panurensis. In the former, only a few individuals feed simultaneously in

351

the same tree, and the same tree is rarely revisited on a given day (Reinehr, 2010). In the latter, the

352

entire group feeds simultaneously, and the same tree can be repeatedly visited on the same day, which

353

creates overlaps in the travel path. This overlap is reflected in the estimates based on IBM, which

354

result in values comparable to the other methods for P. panurensis but not for L. cymosa.

355

In conclusion, our comparative approach allows for better comparability of SDD estimates from

356

studies that employ only one or two of the five approaches in this study. We identified the stages of

357

the seed dispersal loop considered by each method and highlight their advantages and constraints.

358

Despite differences in SDD estimates of the compared methods, estimates were consistently lower for

359

P. panurensis than for L. cymosa. We linked this to plant species-specific traits that influence gut

360

passage time, foraging behaviour and post-feeding movement patterns of the tamarins.

Seed source can only be reliably identified if vectors do not
feed on other individuals of the same plant species between
first feeding on that species and seed deposition
