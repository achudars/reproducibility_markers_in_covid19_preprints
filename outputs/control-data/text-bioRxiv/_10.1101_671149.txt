ABSTRACT
In prior work we demonstrated that loss of E2F transcription factors inhibits metastasis. Here we
address the mechanisms for this phenotype and identify the E2F regulated genes that coordinate
tumor cell metastasis. Transcriptomic profiling of E2F1 knockout tumors identified a role for
E2F1 as a master regulator of a suite of pro-metastatic genes, but also uncovered E2F1 target
genes with an unknown role in pulmonary metastasis. High expression of one of these genes,
Fgf13, is associated with early human breast cancer metastasis in a clinical dataset. Together
these data led to the hypothesis that Fgf13 is critical for breast cancer metastasis, and that
upregulation of Fgf13 may partially explain how E2F1 promotes breast cancer metastasis. To
test this hypothesis we ablated Fgf13 via CRISPR. Deletion of Fgf13 in a MMTV-PyMT breast
cancer cell line reduces the frequency of pulmonary metastasis. In addition, loss of Fgf13
reduced in vitro cell migration, suggesting that Fgf13 may be critical for tumor cells to invade
out of and escape the primary tumor. The significance of this work is twofold: we have both
uncovered genomic features by which E2F1 regulates metastasis and we have identified new
pro-metastatic functions for the E2F1 target gene Fgf13.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer progression to metastatic disease is associated with poor prognosis, with
only 22% of the patients surviving five years 54. As a result, there is a critical need to understand
the molecular mechanisms that regulate metastasis. High throughput transcriptomic assays have
been pivotal in understanding alterations in the transcriptional programs of cancer cells during
the various steps of metastasis. Repeated selection of cells with the propensity for organ-specific

metastasis7, 34, 47 led to the discovery of transcriptional signatures unique to each metastatic site
with characteristic transcriptomic changes51. Other studies have combined clinical observations
with gene expression profiling to generate gene signatures that predict progression to metastasis4,
68, 74

. Finally, gene expression profiling has been used to identify genes involved in metastasis

which were then validated in genetically engineered mouse models of breast cancer2, 11, 30, 71.
One of the best characterized models of breast cancer metastasis is the MMTV-PyMT
system where the expression of the polyoma virus middle T antigen is expressed under the
control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter / enhancer 24. Expression of the middle T
antigen results in activation of key signaling pathways including Ras, PI3K/AKT and PLC-γ.
These transgenic mice rapidly develop multifocal mammary tumors and develop pulmonary
metastasis at endpoint with nearly 100% penetrance.

Our recent work highlighted the

similarities of MMTV-PyMT tumors to human breast cancer and identified shared gene
expression alterations between this mouse model and human disease28. One example is our
observation that E2F pathway signatures were elevated in the MMTV-PyMT model, and we
ultimately validated the role for E2F1, E2F3, and E2F3 in tumor progression using mouse
models28, 30. E2F transcription factors are canonically involved in the G1/S transition, ultimately
either promoting (E2F1-3a) or suppressing (E2F3b-8) cell cycle progression 3, 13, 39. In this study
we expand upon this theme to demonstrate a role for the activator class of E2Fs in tumor
progression independent of their role in cell cycle progression.
Interbreeding MMTV-PyMT mice with mice null for E2F116, E2F249 and E2F332 resulted
in alterations in mammary gland development, tumor latency, histology, and vascularization29, 66.
In addition to, or perhaps as an effect of, the role of E2F1 and E2F2 on these tumor phenotypes,
E2F1 and E2F2 deletion reduced metastatic capacity accompanied by a decrease in circulating

tumor cells. This led to the hypothesis that the E2F transcription factors regulate tumor cell
intrinsic gene expression programs that are critical for metastatic progression.
Given that E2F transcription factors have been demonstrated to bind thousands of
individual target genes5, we sought to characterize the gene expression profiles of E2F1-/MMTV-PyMT tumors. We hypothesized that this approach would allow us to identify E2F1mediated transcriptional programs which contribute to metastasis. This would allow us to
identify E2F1 target genes which were previously implicated in breast cancer metastasis but
would also allow to identify novel metastasis driver genes. In line with this, we have identified a
suite of E2F1 target genes which have been previously implicated in breast cancer metastasis,
suggesting that E2F1 may be a master regulator of breast cancer metastasis. In addition, this
analysis has also identified a new role for the E2F1 target gene fibroblast growth factor 13
(Fgf13) in breast cancer metastasis.

Results
Genomic Comparison of E2FWT/WT and E2F-/- Tumors
To determine the global gene expression response to E2F loss, we analyzed MMTVPyMT tumors from E2FWT/WT, E2F1-/-, E2F2-/-, and E2F3+/- backgrounds on Affymetrix
microarrays. Using an unsupervised classed discovery approach73, we investigated the gene
expression relationships amongst the various tumors. We used 1000 iterations of data resampling
to measure the frequency of co-clustering across 2-10 clusters. Examining potential classes using
empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDF) showed that maximum CDF was reached with
four clusters (Figure 1A). This suggests that this cohort of tumors can be divided into 4 distinct
clusters, and adding additional clusters will have no statistically significant value73. To measure
the correlation between samples within each cluster, we used silhouette width58 (Figure 1B).
Silhouette width demonstrated the strongest correlations were present in cluster 1. In addition,
we observe that the majority of samples have strong similarities to other samples within their
assigned cluster. Sample co-clustering across the iterations of resampling is also illustrated in
Figure 1C (see blue-white heatmap, where white shows 0% co-clustering to dark blue 100%
clustering). Collectively, this analysis suggests the relationship of these tumors is best described
by four clusters.
Examining these clusters in more detail (Figure 1C), we observe that gene expression
patterns correlate with both tumor histology and genotype. For example, cluster 1 (purple)
featured mainly tumors with squamous histology. The microacinar and papillary tumors
appeared to separate by genotype; with the majority of E2F1

-/-

tumors ordered into cluster 2,

E2F2-/- and E2F3+/- tumors in clusters 3 and 4, and E2F WT tumors were present in each cluster.
As an additional analysis, we also used a supervised approach using a published gene set for

intrinsic classification of mouse mammary tumors53. To adjust for centering biases83 and to
enable accurate interpretation of this intrinsic analysis, we combined our dataset with published
data1, 2, 27 using Bayesian Factor Regression Modelling10 (BFRM) to correct batch effects. This
intrinsic analysis again separated tumors from the MMTV-PyMT model across distinct clusters
(Figure S1A) and separated tumors according to histology and genotype (Figure S1B). In
agreement with previous work31, the squamous tumors showed basal-like gene expression
features (Figure S1B, i). MMTV-PyMT E2F1-/- tumors clustered separately from other MMTVPyMT tumors and showed high expression of some genes from the luminal cluster (Figure S1B,
ii). As expected, we did not detect evidence for claudin low tumors across any MMTV-PyMT
tumors (Figure S1B, iv). We did not observe differences in the proliferation cluster genes with
regards to E2F status (Figure S1B, iii). However, we did observe a difference by tumor
histological subtype. Observing median expression of the proliferation signature genes15,
microacinar and squamous tumors showed high expression, while papillary tumors had
significantly lower median expression (p<.01 papillary vs microacinar, or papillary vs squamous;
Figure S2A). In agreement, retrospective analysis of tumor growth rate data, showed that
papillary tumors progressed slower (days until 2,000 mm3) than microacinar or squamous tumors
(Figure S2B). Taken together, these data demonstrate unique features of tumor histologies and
tumor genotypes; with E2F1

-/-

tumors exhibiting key molecular differences to other MMTV-

PyMT tumors.
To test if these gene expression differences in E2F1-/- tumors corresponded to differences
in activation of major cell signaling pathways, we utilized a binary regression approach6 to
predict pathway activation across the MMTV-PyMT tumors. This revealed E2F1-/- tumors tend
to have high activity of E2F4 (Figure 2A), and p53 (Figure 2B) pathways and low activity of

pathways previously implicated in metastasis; the RhoA78, Src50, and Egfr80 signaling pathways
(Figure 2C-E, respectively). Finally, using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA),
we found that E2F1-/- tumors had significantly lower expression of the Hallmark Hypoxia41
signature (Figure 2F); a process also associated with metastasis42.
To test for the genes that were significantly differentially regulated between E2F1-/- and
E2FWT/WT tumors we used a supervised analysis

67

. Since we hypothesized that E2F1’s role in

regulating metastasis was by transcriptional activation of target genes, we were particularly
interested in the 226 genes that were significantly downregulated in the E2F1-/- tumors. Many of
the genes with low expression in E2F1 KO tumors were associated with hypoxia response
(Supplemental file 1).
To begin characterizing these genes for metastatic potential, we used Kaplan Meier
analysis of clinically and intrinsically annotated human breast cancer gene expression data25. To
identify E2F1 target genes, we used ChIPBase 77. Out of the 226 differentially regulated genes,
98 were E2F1 targets (supplemental file 1). From these, we focused on genes where high
expression in tumors correlated with a decreased time to distant metastasis across all breast
cancers as well as within with individual intrinsic subtypes of tumors. We identified 55 genes
with pro-metastatic predictions (without discordant predictions in differing subtypes)
(supplemental file 1); 34 of which had demonstrated E2F1 binding sites 5. Using a Fisher’s exact
test, we observed that the distribution of direct E2F1 targets was significantly higher in the genes
concordant with human breast cancer metastasis predictions (p=0.001) than genes either
discordant or not predictive of human breast cancer metastasis. This suggested that the E2F1
target genes altered in these tumors are associated with human breast cancer metastatic potential
and highlights that E2F1 may be a master regulator of breast cancer metastasis since it controls

the expression of multiple pro-metastatic genes.
The 55 genes identified above that were associated with human breast cancer metastasis
were examined in the literature to identify which of the molecular changes have already been
demonstrated to regulate breast cancer metastasis in vivo.

As depicted in Figure S3, Vegfa59,

Hbegf84, Hspb123, Flt165, L1cam82, and Plaur76 had significantly lower expression (p<0.05) in
E2F1-/- tumors and have all previously been shown to regulate breast cancer metastasis in vivo.
Additionally, there were genes with significantly lower expression in E2F1-/- tumors that had
been shown to have in vitro invasion or migration function such as Areg26, Tead181, Coro1C69,
Lama522, Tgm245, and Fgf 779 (p<0.05, Figure S4). Taken together, this shows that E2F1-/tumors have low expression of genes and pathways demonstrated to promote breast cancer
metastasis.
Testing additional genes for metastatic function
Since we had identified a number of pathways and genes altered in E2F1-/- tumors which
were previously identified as metastasis driver genes, we sought to identify novel regulators of
metastasis from the genes downregulated in E2F1-/- tumors. Candidate genes for further testing
were prioritized by selecting genes that had not previously been demonstrated to regulate breast
cancer metastasis, that were E2F target genes, and correlated with decreased time to distant
metastasis across several human breast cancer human breast cancer subtypes. With this pipeline
we identified differential expression of fibroblast growth factor 13 (Fgf13). As shown in Figure
3A, expression was significantly reduced 1.4-fold in E2F1-/- tumors (q=0.01, p=0.02). Analysis
of the 500 bp sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) revealed seven E2F
binding motifs in human and ten in the mouse sequence for this gene. High expression of Fgf13
was significantly associated with faster onset of distant metastasis across all cases of breast

cancer (Figure 3B) but was not significant across all Er+ tumors (Figure 3C). However, it was
significantly associated with accelerated time to distant metastasis in Er- tumors (Figure 3D).
Observing intrinsic subtypes, Fgf13 was not associated with metastasis of Luminal A tumors
(Figure 3E). However, in Luminal B, Basal-like, and Her-2 enriched tumors high expression Fgf
13 was predictive of early onset metastasis (Figure 3F-H respectively).
To test this gene for metastatic behavior, we utilized a PyMT-derived cell line (PyMT
419 cells) 44 and a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) approach
to create Fgf13 knockout cells. Figure 4A shows an example of sequence trace for Fgf13 control
and a knockout lines. Western blot analysis confirmed that protein levels of Fgf13 were impacted
by CRISPR gene editing (Figure 4B). In addition, we transduced our knockout lines with a
vector to restore Fgf13 and confirmed re-addition by Fgf13 by western blot (Figure 4B).
We opted to assess metastatic capacity by tail vein injection. In this setting 50,000 cells
were injected into the tail vein and lung colonization was examined 21 days later. In mice
receiving control cells, robust metastatic colonization of the lungs was observed (Figure 5A). In
addition, metastatic tumors were found sporadically throughout the mouse at other sites. Loss of
Fgf13 dramatically limited the ability of the tumor cells to form metastases at the lung (Figure
5B) and re-expression of Fgf13 restored metastasis (Figure 5C). There was a significant
reduction in the number of lesions present in the lungs for mice receiving Fgf13-/- cells (Figure
5D). Together, these results show that Fgf13 regulates breast cancer pulmonary metastasis.
Investigating Fgf13 function
To predict Fgf13 function, we examined the Fgf13 covariance network using WGCNA
analysis of primary MMTV-PyMT E2F wild type tumors (supplemental file 2), identifying 38
probes corresponding to 35 genes that tightly correlate with Fgf13 expression (gs threshold =0.6,

p-value <0.0005). MSigDB revealed a significant association with a signature for genes upregulated in invasive ductal carcinoma relative to ductal carcinoma in situ (Supplemental File 3,
p-value =1.02 e -4, FDR q-value =3.97 e -2). We were also interested to note association with the
Rac1 cell motility pathway (Supplemental File 2, p-value = 5.38 e -7, FDR q-value = 1.29 e -3).
Key to this association was strong covariance with Rac1 (gs=0.60), the GTPase activating
protein chimerin 1 (Chn1, gs=0.60), and Wasf1 (which acts downstream of Rac1 to regulate the
cytoskeleton, gs=0.61). Matching this association, Fgf13 was part of the KEGG pathway for
regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Testing these alterations for the presence of an interaction
network with Rb-E2F1 and the pathways altered in E2F1-/- tumors illustrated a relationship
between Fgf13, cytoskeleton and motility genes, and pathways predicted to have low activity in
E2F1-/- tumors (Figure 6A). WGCNA identified additional genes with cytoskeleton regulatory
function such Tubulin beta 6 (Tubb6) and microtubule-associated protein 1B (Mtap1B). In
addition, given Fgf13’s published role in neuronal cell differentiation75, we were interested to
note this as another prominent theme amongst the Fgf13 metagene (Table 1). In testing these
genes as a signature for association with human breast cancer metastasis events, we found that
high expression of these genes was significantly associated with a shorter time to distant
metastasis across breast cancer tumors (Figure 6B).
To test for a possible function in cell motility, we assessed the migratory capacity of the
MMTV-PyMT control cells and Fgf13 KO cells using a scratch assay (Figure 6C). While control
cells were able to close the scratch at 18 hours, the Fgf13 KO clones demonstrated a significant
defect in cell migration. Re-expression of Fgf13 restored migratory capacity of these cells, with
wounds nearly closed by 18 hours (Figure 6D). Together, these data confirm the bioinformatic

predictions that Fgf13 functions in cell migration and provides a likely explanation for the
metastasis defects associated with Fgf13 loss.

DISCUSSION
Using a transcriptomic approach, we investigated the mechanism by which E2Fs regulate
breast cancer metastasis

30

. Here we used bioinformatic analysis to compare global gene

expression differences between E2FWT/WT MMTV-PyMT tumors and E2F1-/- MMTV-PyMT
tumors. We demonstrated that loss of E2F1 led to decreased activity in several key signaling
pathways previously demonstrated to regulate metastasis (Figure 2). Many of the genes
downregulated in E2F1-/- tumors correlate with a faster progression to metastatic disease in
human clinical data were significantly associated with the gene expression response to hypoxia
(Supplemental File 1).
The majority of the genes associated with hypoxia were also direct E2F1 target genes.
Hypoxia has been described as a master regulator of metastasis due to the result of gene
expression changes brought about by hypoxia response42. These gene expression changes enable
tumor cells to progress through multiple checkpoints during the metastatic cascade.

This

includes promoting angiogenesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, tumor cell invasion,
remodeling of the extra cellular matrix, and increasing cell migration

20, 37, 42, 62

. Hypoxia also

upregulates genes which facilitate tumor cell intravasation, survival in the blood stream,
extravasation and colonization at distant organs

42

. Consistent with processes associated with

hypoxia response, we previously observed angiogenesis defects and a decrease in circulating
tumor cells suggesting intravasation defects or an inability for metastatic cells to resist anoikis 29.
Our prior work had shown that these vascular defects were associated with a significant
reduction in the major angiogenesis signaling molecule, Vegfa. This study expands on this
finding and adds to the growing body of research that has demonstrated E2F1 as a key regulator
of angiogenesis14, 16, 18, 55; suggesting E2F1 regulates many genes within the hypoxia response

program to potentially coordinate the development of tumor vasculature.
In addition to hypoxia response, E2F1-/- tumors had significantly lower expression of
genes previously associated with metastasis. In vitro studies have demonstrated that Areg

26

,

Tead1 81 , Coro1C 69, Lama5 22, Tgm2 45 and Fgf 7 79 are involved in cell migration and invasion
features of tumor cells. The reduced expression of these genes involved in invasion phenotypes
may provide additional mechanistic information to explain our previous finding that E2F1-/tumors had possible invasion/intravasation problems indicated by a reduction in circulating
tumor cells 30.
The data presented here also demonstrated a role for Fgf13 in metastasis. Fgf13 is a
nonsecretory protein of the FGF family 75 and we show that loss of Fgf13 in tumor cells blocked
colonization of the lungs in a tail vein injection setting. In order to investigate the mechanism for
this block of metastatic capacity, we identified that genes that co-vary with Fgf13 using
WGCNA. Amongst these genes, we noted several genes associated with cell motility were in an
interaction network with FGF13. This led us to predict that FGF13 may function in cell
migration. We confirmed this prediction using a scratch assay where both Fgf13 knockout clones
demonstrated impaired cell migration. Interestingly, the role of Fgf13 in neuron development
also highlights its role in cell migration while detailing a mechanism of Fgf13 induced
microtubule stabilization75. Within the Fgf13 covariate network, we also observe many genes
consistent with microtubule stabilization and neuron development (Table 1). This agreement
between the two studies might suggest conserved mechanisms for cell migration in tumor cells
and in neurons. Further, drawing from our study and that of Wu et al. 75 predicts that the possible
function of Fgf13 in metastasis may be attributed to a function in cell migration via microtubule
stabilization.

As a whole, this study shows that the metastatic defects associated with E2F1 loss could
be due to an inability to properly initiate a gene expression response to hypoxia. Importantly,
many of the genes downregulated in E2F1-/- tumors associated with hypoxia response have been
shown as regulators breast cancer metastasis. We identified that the E2F1 target gene Fgf13
controls pulmonary metastasis, potentially through a cell migration mechanism; possibly
providing a means for E2F1 to regulate cell migration. Collectively, this study furthers our initial
characterization of E2F1’s regulation of metastasis by identifying the metastasis associated gene
expression response to E2F1 loss.

METHODS
RNA AND MICROARRAY
Preparation of RNA samples from flash frozen tumors was done using the Qiagen
RNeasy kit after roto-stator homogenization. RNA from 17 Myc induced tumors was submitted
to the Michigan State University Genomics Core facility for gene expression analysis using
Mouse 430A 2.0 Affymetrix arrays.
GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS
Raw intensity .CEL files were processed and RMA normalized using Affymetrix
Expression Console. Gene expression data is deposited on the Gene Expression Omnibus under
the accession number GSE104397. Unsupervised class discovery was done using Consensus
Cluster Plus73. For class discovery, we mapped Affymetrix probes to their gene symbol using the
platform table deposited on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GPL8321). Given the presence of
multiple probes for single genes, we collapsed duplicate genes to their mean expression in each
sample. This approach reduced our dataset of 22690 probes down to 12847 gene symbols. Next,
we median centered the gene expression values across the samples in the dataset. Finally, we
filtered genes using a requirement of a standard deviation greater than 0.5. This resulted in 1,303
genes used for class discovery and consensus clustering. We used 1,000 iterations and 90% item
(sample) resampling to evaluate 2-10 potential clusters (groups/classes). Consensus cumulative
distribution function (CDF) plots are also generated using Consensus Cluster Plus73. Silhouette
width58 was used to assess validity of each cluster using the R package ‘Cluster’52. Pathway
activation was predicted according to previous studies 6, 21, 28. Single sample gene set enrichment
analysis was done for Hallmark41 gene sets using the ssGSEAProjection module on Broad
Institute’s Gene Pattern57. Significance analysis of microarrays

67

was used to compare E2F

tumors in a fold change analysis. Direct E2F1 target genes were identified

using ChIP-base

77

and data from a previous ChIP-seq experiment 5. Kaplan-Meier plots were

generated using using KMPLOT.com to query human breast cancer expression and clinical
data64. Significant overlaps with previously established gene sets were detected using the
molecular signatures database41. Interaction networks were assembled using www.string-db.org
19

. Weighted correlation network analysis was implemented according to published protocols

38

and using a gene significance score threshold of 0.6 to select genes for further analysis.

CELL CULTURE
MMTV-PyMT 419 cells were a gift from Dr. Stuart Sell and Dr. Ian Guessand have been
previously characterized44.

All tumor cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's

Medium, 3.7 g/L of NaHCO3, 3.5 g/L d-glucose, 5ug/mL insulin, 1ug/mL hydrocortisone,
5ng/mL Egf, 35ug/mL BPE, 50ug/mL gentamicin, 1X Antibiotic/Antimycotic, and 10% fetal
bovine serum. Media was set to a pH of 7.4.
CRISPR
Sequence for Fgf13 was obtained from the UCSC genome browser 36. Guide sequences
were predicted by submitting exon (using only those that were common across all Fgf13
isoforms) sequence using the CRISPR design tool at: http://crispr.mit.edu/. Oligos for guide
sequence assembly were designed by adding a ‘G’ followed by ‘CACC’ at the 5’ end of the
guide sequence. For the complementary DNA to the guide, add ‘CAAA’ to the 5’ end.
Oligonucleotide sequences are as follows:
Fgf13 5’: CACCGTCAGCAGCAATCCGGCCGA
Fgf13 3’: AAACTCGGCCGGATTGCTGCTGACC

Oligonucleotides for guide sequence assembly were ordered from integrated DNA technologies
https://www.idtdna.com/site. Oligos were diluted to a concentration of 100uM in water. To
anneal the oligonucleotides 5 uL of the forward and 5uL of the reverse oligo are incubated in
10uL of 2X annealing buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5–8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) at 95
degrees Celsius for 4 minutes, and then cooled to room temperature.

The annealed

oligonucleotides were inserted into the PX458 vector from Addgene (#48138). Confirmation of
the cloned guide sequence was done using Sanger sequencing.
PyMT 419 cells were transfected according to a previously described protocol40. To
select clones, GFP positive cells were sorted into 96 well plates using fluorescence activated cell
sorting. Knockout clones were screened for by PCR amplifying a ~300 bp amplicon with the
PAM sequence centrally located within the PCR product. PCR products were resolved on a 3%
agarose gel, extracted with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, and were submitted for sanger
sequencing.
PCR Amplification Primers:
Fgf13 5’: 5’-TGTTCTAACTTCCAGAAAGGCATA-3’
Fgf13 3’: 5’-CAGTGGTTTGGGCAGAAAAT-3’
For sequencing, a nested primer with the following sequence was used.
Fgf13 5’: 5’-CACACCCATATAAGTATTGACTTTCA-3’
Knockout and add-back were confirmed by western blot according to published
methods27. For western blots, we used a polyclonal Fgf13 antibody (Invitrogen PA527302) and
for beta-actin we used a monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling #4970). The Fgf13 ORF was
purchased from GenScript in the pcDNA3.1 vector and were subsequently digested with EcoRI
and XhoI cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pLXSN. Retrovirus was packaged in HEK293GPG as previously described (90). Briefly, a confluent 10-cm plate of HEK-293GPG cells

was transfected with 5 µg of pLXSN-mADM or pLXSN-mFGF13 and virus containing media
was subsequently harvested. Subconfluent 10 cm plates (~20%confluence) of 419 cells were
infected with 1 mL of non-concentrated viral supernatant and infected cells were selected with
300 µg/mL G418.

IN VITRO ASSAYS
To measure cell migration, wound healing assays were performed in the presence of
2ug/mL Mitomycin C using standard methods60. Photomicrographs were taken at 0 hour and 18
hours.
IN VIVO ASSAYS
Animal protocols used for this study were approved by Michigan State University
IACUC Committee and conducted according to national and institutional guidelines. All mice
were in the FVB background. For tail vein injection, MMTV-Cre control mice were used to
avoid immune response to the middle T antigen

17, 43, 56

. For control cells and each knockout

clone, 50,000 cells were injected into the bloodstream via the tail vein. After 21 days, mice were
euthanized. Lungs were resected for H&E staining to detect metastases. To calculate
significance, unpaired T-tests were done in graphpad prism.

Figure 1-Consensus clustering reveals the major gene expression classes of MMTV-PyMT
E2F knockout tumors.
(A)

Unsupervised class discovery of MMTV-PyMT tumor gene expression data (GSE

104397) by measure of empirical cumulative distribution functions73. The x-axis displays the
consensus index, which is a measure of samples clustering together (0.0 samples that never
cluster together, 1.0 samples that always cluster together). On the y-axis the CDF value is
displayed. This provides a measure of cluster stability. Thus, this plot measures which number of
clusters (as color coded) that provide maximum CDF (stable classification) for samples that are
ambiguous (may not always cluster together). (B) A silhouette width58 analysis based upon the
four clusters identified measures the correlation of samples within each cluster (the higher the
silhouette width, the higher the correlation of a given sample to other samples in the cluster; each
bar represent a sample). (C) The consensus cluster based upon the four selected clusters (as
determined in A). Consensus clustering was performed using 1,000 iterations and 90% item
(sample) resampling. The dendrogram across the top shows the relationship of samples on the
basis of gene expression profiles. Below the dendrogram, color coded boxes itemize the cluster
labels and concordant to those shown in panel B. Next, black bars provide sample annotations
for genotype and tumor histology according to sample position in the dendrogram above and
heatmaps below. Next, the blue heatmap illustrates the sample and cluster relationships over the
1,000 iterations of 90% resampling and cluster classification. The darkest blue indicates samples
that co-clustered 100% of the time, white indicates samples that never clustered together. For
samples with intermediate values, the percentage of co-clustering with other samples outside the
cluster is shown. For example, the far left samples in cluster 2, sometimes clustered with samples

Figure 2- Gene expression signatures reveal pathway activation differences with loss of
E2F1.
(A) Using a binary regression approach6, 28 to predict E2F4 activity reveals significantly higher
probability of E2F4 pathway activation in E2F1 KO tumors compared to E2F WT tumors
(p=0.04). (B) Using a binary regression approach6, 28 to predict p53 activity reveals significantly
higher probability of p53 pathway activation in E2F1 KO tumors compared to E2F WT tumors
(p=0.04). (C) Using a binary regression approach6,

28

to predict RhoA activity reveals a

significant reduction of probable RhoA pathway activation in E2F1 KO tumors compared to E2F
WT tumors (p=0.001). (D) Using a binary regression approach6, 28 to predict Src activity reveals
a reduction of probable Src pathway activation in E2F1 KO tumors compared to E2F WT tumors
(p=0.05). (E) Using a binary regression approach6, 28 to predict Egfr activity reveals a significant
reduction of probable Egfr pathway activation in E2F1 KO tumors compared to E2F WT tumors
(p=0.02). (F) Using single sample gene set enrichment41, 63 to analyze expression of the Hallmark
Hypoxia Response signature shows a significantly lower enrichment score in E2F1 KO tumors
compared to E2F WT tumors (p=0.01).

Figure 3- Expression of Fgf 13 is in E2F1 knockout tumors and association with human
breast cancer metastasis.
(A) Boxplot of RMA-normalized median centered expression levels of Fgf13 across MMTVPyMT tumors shows a significant reduction of expression in E2F1 KO tumors (p=0.002,
SAM : q=.01, 1.4 fold change). (B) Kaplan-Meier analysis of distant metastasis free
survival across a dataset of human breast cancer25 shows that high expression of Fgf13 is
associated with accelerated onset of metastatic progression (HR=1.59, logrank p= 2e-05).
(C) Kaplan-Meier analysis of distant metastasis free survival across a dataset of human
breast cancer25 shows that high expression of Fgf13 is associated (but not statistically
significant) with accelerated onset of metastatic progression in estrogen receptor (ER)
positive breast cancers .(D) Kaplan-Meier analysis of distant metastasis free survival
across a dataset of human breast cancer25 shows that high expression of Fgf13 is
associated with accelerated onset of metastatic progression in ER-negative breast cancers
(HR=2.27, logrank p= 0.0075). (E) Kaplan-Meier analysis of distant metastasis free
survival across a dataset of human breast cancer25 shows that high expression of Fgf13 is
associated (but not statistically significant) with accelerated onset of metastatic
progression in luminal A breast cancers. (F) Kaplan-Meier analysis of distant metastasis
free survival across a dataset of human breast cancer25 shows that high expression of
Fgf13 is associated with accelerated onset of metastatic progression in luminal B breast
cancers (HR=1.94, logrank p=2e-04). (G) Kaplan-Meier analysis of distant metastasis free
survival across a dataset of human breast cancer25 shows that high expression of Fgf13 is
associated with accelerated onset of metastatic progression in basal-like breast cancers
(HR=1.89, logrank p=0.034). (H) Kaplan-Meier analysis of distant metastasis free

analysis for Fgf13 WT cells, Fgf13 knockout cells, and Fgf13 add back cells.
Figure 5- Fgf13 function in metastatic colonization of the lungs.
(A)Representative image of lungs from mice receiving 419 control cells via a tail vein injection
shows robust metastatic colonization of the lungs. (B) Lungs of mouse receiving the Fgf13
knockout clone 3H1 shows that loss of Fgf13 impaired tumor cell colonization of the lungs. (C)
Lungs of mouse receiving the Fgf13 addback (to clone 3H1) shows that restoration of Fgf13
allows tumor cell colonization of the lungs. Quantification of FGF13 KO and addback clones
compared to MMTV-PyMT 419 cell line control cells (black bar) shows a significant reduction
in metastasis to the lungs in mice receiving or FGF13 (green bars) knockout cells (unpaired ttest, p<0.05; each clone compared by to wild type control).

significance score greater than 0.60 shows FGF13 many of the the FGF13 metagene are
demonstrated interactors, including genes that function in cell motility (Rac1, Wasf1, Chn1). In
addition, these covariance network genes associate with the Ras, Egfr, RhoA, Src, Rb, E2F1, and
beta-catenin pathways. (B) Kaplan Meier analysis for the Fgf 13 covariance network genes as a
signature shows these genes are significantly associated with earlier human breast cancer
metastasis. (C) Scratch assay photos showing impaired migratory ability of 419 control cells,
