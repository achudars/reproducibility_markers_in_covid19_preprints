The cerebral cortex underlies our complex cognitive capabilities, yet we know little
about the specific genetic loci influencing human cortical structure. To identify genetic
variants, including structural variants, impacting cortical structure, we conducted a
genome-wide association meta-analysis of brain MRI data from 51,662 individuals. We
analysed the surface area and average thickness of the whole cortex and 34 regions with
known functional specialisations. We identified 255 nominally significant loci (P ≤ 5 x
10-8); 199 survived multiple testing correction (P ≤ 8.3 x 10-10; 187 surface area; 12
thickness). We found significant enrichment for loci influencing total surface area
within regulatory elements active during prenatal cortical development, supporting the
radial unit hypothesis. Loci impacting regional surface area cluster near genes in Wnt
signalling pathways, known to influence progenitor expansion and areal identity.
Variation in cortical structure is genetically correlated with cognitive function,
Parkinson’s disease, insomnia, depression and ADHD.
One Sentence Summary: Common genetic variation is associated with inter-individual
variation in the structure of the human cortex, both globally and within specific regions, and
is shared with genetic risk factors for some neuropsychiatric disorders.
The human cerebral cortex is the outer grey matter layer of the brain, which is implicated in
multiple aspects of higher cognitive function. Its distinct folding pattern is characterised by
convex (gyral) and concave (sulcal) regions. Computational brain mapping approaches use
the consistent folding patterns across individual cortices to label brain regions(1). During
fetal development excitatory neurons, the predominant neuronal cell-type in the cortex, are
generated from neural progenitor cells in the developing germinal zone(2). The radial unit
hypothesis(3) posits that the expansion of cortical surface area (SA) is driven by the
proliferation of these neural progenitor cells, whereas thickness (TH) is determined by the
number of neurogenic divisions. Variation in global and regional measures of cortical SA and
TH are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and psychological traits(4) (Table S1).
Twin and family-based brain imaging studies show that SA and TH measurements are highly
heritable and are largely influenced by independent genetic factors(5). Despite extensive
studies of genes impacting cortical structure in model organisms(6), our current
understanding of genetic variation impacting human cortical size and patterning is limited to
rare, highly penetrant variants(7, 8). These variants often disrupt cortical development,
leading to altered post-natal structure. However, little is known about how common genetic
variants impact human cortical SA and TH.
To address this, we conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses of cortical SA and TH
measures in 51,662 individuals from 60 cohorts from around the world (Tables S2–S4).
Cortical measures were extracted from structural brain MRI scans in regions defined by gyral
anatomy using the Desikan-Killiany atlas(9). We analysed two global measures, total SA and
average TH, and SA and TH for 34 regions averaged across both hemispheres, yielding 70
distinct phenotypes (Fig. 1A; Table S1).
Within each cohort genome-wide association (GWAS) for each of the 70 phenotypes was
conducted using an additive model. To identify genetic influences specific to each region, the
primary GWAS of regional measures included the global measure of SA or TH as a
covariate. To better localise the global findings, regional GWAS were also run without
controlling for global measures. To estimate the multiple testing burden associated with
analysing 70 phenotypes we used matrix spectral decomposition(10), which yielded 60
independent traits. Therefore, we adopted a significance threshold of P ≤ 8.3 x 10-10.

The principal meta-analysis comprised results from 49 ENIGMA cohorts of European
ancestry (23,909 participants) and the UK Biobank(11) (10,083 participants of European
ancestry). We sought replication for loci reaching P ≤ 5 x 10-8 in an additional ENIGMA
cohort (777 participants) and with the CHARGE consortium(12) (13,950 participants,
excluding UK Biobank). In addition, we meta-analysed eight cohorts of non-European
ancestry (2,943 participants) to examine the generalization of these effects. High genetic
correlations were observed between the meta-analysed ENIGMA European cohorts
(excluding UK Biobank) and the UK Biobank cohort using LD-score regression (total SA rG
= 1.00, P = 2.7 x 10-27, average TH rG = 0.91, P = 1.7 x 10-19), indicating consistent genetic
architecture between the 49 ENIGMA cohorts and the single-site, single-scanner UK Biobank
cohort.
Across the 70 cortical phenotypes we identified 306 loci that were nominally genome-wide
significant in the principal meta-analysis (P ≤ 5 x 10-8; Fig. 1B; Table S5). Of these 118 are
novel, neither they nor their proxies have been associated with cortical SA or TH or volume
in previous studies(12-14). Twenty of these were insertions or deletions (INDELs), which
were not available in the replication data set. Eleven INDELs could be replicated with a
proxy SNP; however, for six INDELs and one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) there
were no proxies available to assess replication. Of the 299 loci, 255 remained genome-wide
significant when the replication data were included in the meta-analysis (241 influencing SA
and 14 influencing TH), with 199 passing multiple testing correction (P ≤ 8.3 x 10-10; 187
influencing SA and 12 influencing TH). Of the 255 loci that replicated in Europeans, eleven
SNPs were not available or did not pass quality control in the meta-analysis of non-European
cohorts. Of the remaining 244 loci, 241 were supported in the meta-analysis with the nonEuropean cohorts, such that the beta from the principal meta-analysis was contained within
the 95% confidence intervals from the non-European meta-analysis. While most effects
generalized across ancestry groups, some loci showed evidence of substantial heterogeneity.
Table S5 details these results and Figure S1 sumarises these meta-analytic steps and results.
Significant gene-based association was observed for 253 genes across the 70 cortical
phenotypes (Table S6). Figures summarising the meta-analytic results (Manhattan, QQ,
Forest, and Locus Zoom plots) are provided in the additional online materials.
Genetics of total SA and average TH
Common variants explained 34% (SE = 3%) of the variation in total SA and 26% (SE = 2%)
in average TH, which approaches a third of the heritability estimated from twin and family
studies(5) (Table S7). We observed a significant negative genetic correlation between total
SA and average TH (rG = -.32, SE = .05, P = 6.5 x 10-12; Fig. 2A), which persisted after
excluding the chromosome 17 inversion region known to influence brain size(14 ) (rG = -.31,
SE = .05, P = 3.3 x 10-12). The direction of this correlation suggests that opposing genetic
influences may constrain the total cortical size. The small magnitude of this correlation is
consistent with the radial unit hypothesis(3), whereby different developmental mechanisms
promote SA and TH expansion.
As expected, total SA showed a positive genetic correlation with intracranial volume (ICV);
this correlation remained after controlling for height demonstrating that this relationship is
not solely driven by body size (Fig. 2A; Table S8). The global cortical measures did not show
significant genetic correlations with the volumes of major subcortical structures (Fig. 2A)
except for total SA and the hippocampus, consistent with their shared telencephalic
developmental origin. This indicates variation in cortical and subcortical structures have

predominantly independent genetic influences, consistent with known differences in cell-type
composition between these structures.
To identify if common variation associated with cortical structure perturbs gene regulation
during a specific developmental time period or within a given cell-type, we performed
partitioned heritability analyses(15) using sets of gene regulatory annotations from adult and
fetal brain tissues(16, 17). The strongest enrichment of the heritability for global SA was seen
within areas of active gene regulation (promoters and enhancers) in the mid-fetal human
brain (Fig. 2B). We further identified a stronger enrichment in regions of the fetal cortex with
more accessible chromatin in the neural progenitor-enriched germinal zone than in the
neuron-enriched cortical plate(16). There was also enrichment of active regulatory elements
within embryonic stem cells differentiated to neural progenitors(17). We conducted pathway
analyses to determine if there was enrichment of association near genes in known biological
pathways. Among the 998 significant gene-sets a number were involved in chromatin
modification, a process guiding neurodevelopmental fate decisions(18) (Fig. 3C, Table S9).
These findings suggest that total SA in adults is influenced by common genetic variants that
may alter gene regulatory activity in neural progenitor cells during fetal development,
supporting the radial unit hypothesis(3). In contrast, the strongest evidence of enrichment for
average TH was found in active regulatory elements in the adult brain samples, which may
reflect processes occurring after mid-fetal development, such as myelination, branching, or
pruning(19).

Loci influencing total SA and average TH
Of the replicated loci, 17 loci were nominally associated with total SA; 12 survived
correction for multiple testing (Fig. 2C, Table S5). Eight loci influencing total SA have been
previously associated with ICV(14). Of these, rs79600142 (P = 2.3 x 10-32; Prep = 3.5 x 10-43),
in the highly pleiotropic chromosome 17q21.31 inversion region, has been associated with
Parkinson’s disease(20), educational attainment(21), and neuroticism(22). On 10q24.33,
rs1628768 (P = 1.7 x 10-13; Prep = 1.0 x 10-17) is a cortical expression quantitative trait locus
(eQTL)(23) in adult cortex for INA, and schizophrenia candidate genes AS3MT, NT5C2 and
WBP1L(24) (PADULT = 9.0 x 10-3; Tables S10–S11). This region has been associated with
schizophrenia, however, rs1628768 is in low LD with the schizophrenia-associated SNP
rs11191419 (r2 = 0.15). The 6q21 locus influencing total SA is intronic to FOXO3 (which
also showed a significant gene-based association with total SA, Table S6). The minor allele
of the lead variant rs2802295 is associated with decreased total SA (P = 2.5 x 10-10; Prep = 2.5
x 10-13) and has previously been associated with lower general cognitive function(25)
(rs2490272: PCognition = 9.9 x 10-14; r2rs2802295:rs2490272 = 1).
Of the loci not previously associated with ICV, our novel loci include rs11171739 (P = 8.4 x
10-10; Prep = 8.1 x 10-11) on 12q13.2. In high LD with SNPs associated with educational
attainment(21), rs11171739 is an eQTL for RPS26 in fetal(26) and adult cortex (PFETAL = 6.1
x 10-27, PADULT = 8.8 x 10-49; Tables S10–S11). This eQTL association was recently
highlighted in a brain expression GWAS including subjects with Alzheimer’s disease and
other brain pathologies(27). On 2q24.2, rs13021985 (P = 3.4 x 10-9; Prep = 8.1 x 10-12) is a
fetal cortex eQTL for TBR1 (PFETAL = 1.4 x 10-4; Tables S10–S11), a transcription factor
specifically expressed in postmitotic projection neurons and part of the Pax6-Tbr2-Tbr1
cascade that modulates numerous neurodevelopmental processes(28). On 3p24.1, rs12630663
(P = 1.3 x 10-8; Prep = 1.4 x 10-8) is of interest due to its proximity (~200kb) to EOMES (also
known as TBR2), which is expressed specifically in intermediate progenitor cells(29) in the
developing fetal cortex(2). rs12630663 is located in a chromosomal region with chromatin
accessibility specific to the human fetal cortex germinal zone of human(16). This region
shows significant chromatin interaction with the EOMES promoter(29) and contains
numerous regulatory elements that when excised via CRISPR/Cas9 in differentiating neural
progenitor cells significantly reduced EOMES expression(16). A rare homozygous
chromosomal translocation in the region separating the regulatory elements from EOMES
(Fig. S2) silences its expression and causes microcephaly(30) demonstrating that rare and
common non-coding variation can have similar phenotypic consequences, but to different
degrees.
The two replicated loci associated with average TH, both of which are novel, survived
correction for multiple testing (Fig. 2C; Table S5). On 3p22.1 rs533577 (P = 8.4 x 10-11; Prep
= 3.7 x 10-12) is a fetal cortex eQTL (PFETAL= 8.9 x 10-6) for RPSA, encoding a 40S ribosomal
protein with a potential role as a laminin receptor(31). Laminins are major constituents of
extracellular matrix, and have critical roles in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation and
migration(32). On 2q11.2, rs11692435 (P = 3.2 x 10-10; Prep = 4.5 x 10-10) encodes a missense
variant (p.A143V) predicted to impact ACTR1B protein function, and is an ACTR1B eQTL
in fetal cortex (PFETAL = 6.5 x 10-3) (Tables S10–S11). ACTR1B is a subunit of the dynactin
complex involved in microtubule remodeling, which is important for neuronal migration(33).
Genetics of regional SA and TH
Within individual cortical regions the amount of phenotypic variance explained by common
variants was higher for SA (8–31%) than for TH (1–13%) (Fig. 3A–B; Table S7). With few

exceptions, the genetic correlations between SA and TH within the same region were
moderate and negative (Tables S12–S13), suggesting that genetic variants contributing to the
expansion of SA tend to decrease TH. Most genetic correlations between regional surface
areas did not survive multiple testing correction, and those that did implied a general pattern
of positive correlations between physically adjacent regions and negative correlations with
more distal regions (Fig. 3A). This pattern mirrored the phenotypic correlations between
regions and was also observed for TH (Fig. 3A–B). The positive genetic correlations were
typically between SA of regions surrounding the major, early forming sulci (e.g.,
pericalcarine, lingual, cuneus, and lateral occipital regions surrounding the calcarine sulcus),
which may potentially reflect genetic effects acting on the development of the sulci.
However, the general pattern of correlations may, in part, depend on the regional partitioning
by the Desikan-Killiany atlas(9) (supplementary text). Hierarchical clustering of the genetic
correlations resulted in a general grouping by physical proximity (Fig. S3).

that modelled the phenotypic correlations between regions. Pathway analyses of the
multivariate SA results showed significant enrichment for 903 gene sets (Fig. 3D; Table S9),
many of which are involved in Wnt signalling, with the canonical Wnt signalling pathway
showing the strongest enrichment (P = 8.8 x 10-11). Wnt proteins regulate neural progenitor
fate decisions(35, 36) and are expressed in spatially specific manners influencing areal
identity(6). Pathway analyses of the multivariate TH results did not yield any findings that
survived multiple testing.
Loci influencing regional SA and TH
A total of 224 loci were nominally associated with regional SA and 12 with TH; of these 175
SA and 10 TH loci survived multiple testing correction (Table S5). As shown in Fig. 1C,
most loci were associated with a single cortical region. Of the loci influencing regional
measures, few were also associated with global measures, and those that were showed effects
in the same direction, implying that the significant regional loci were not due to collider
bias(37) (Fig. S4).
The strongest regional association was observed on chromosome 15q14 with the precentral
SA (rs1080066, P = 1.8 x 10-137; Prep = 4.6 x 10-189; variance explained = 1.03%; Fig 4A).
Across 11 traits we observed 41 independent significant associations from 18 LD blocks (r2
threshold ≤ .02; see Fig. 4D, Table S5). As we observed strong association with the SA of
both pre- and post-central gyri, we localised the association within the central sulcus in 5,993
unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank. The maximal association between rs1080066
and sulcal depth was observed around the pli de passage fronto-pariétal moyen (P = 7.9 x 1021
), a region associated with hand fine-motor function in humans(38) and shows distinct depth
patterns across different species of primates(39) (Fig. 4C). Variants in the rs1080066 LD
block are fetal cortex eQTLs for an upsteam lncRNA RP11-275I4.2 (PFETAL = 4.0 x 10-4) and
a downstream gene EIF2AK4 (PFETAL = 7.4 x 10-3) encoding the GCN2 protein, a negative
regulator of synaptic plasticity, memory and neuritogenesis(40). The functional data also
highlight THBS1, with roles in synaptogenesis and the maintenance of synaptic integrity(41),
with chromatin interaction between the rs1080066 region and the THBS1 promoter in neural
progenitor cells and an eQTL effect in whole blood (PBIOSgenelevel = 1.5 x 10-9). There was
evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of rs1080066 across the non-European cohorts (Table
S5), which might be due in part to the strength of the effect and the disparate power across
ancestry groups.
At another region containing multiple regional hits, on 14q23.1, we observed 20 significant
loci (Table S5) from four LD blocks. Our strongest association here was for the precuneus
SA (rs73313052: P = 1.1 x 10-24; Prep = 2.2 x 10-35; variance explained = 0.18%). These loci
are located near DACT1 and DAAM1, both involved in synapse formation and critical
members of the Wnt signalling cascade(42, 43). rs73313052 and high LD proxies are eQTLs
for DAAM1 (PADULT = 9.0 x 10-3) in adult cortex and for LRRC9 (PFETAL = 3.9 x 10-3) in fetal
cortex, LRRC9 is primarily expressed in brain tissue but is of unknown function (Tables S10–
S11).

Consistent with enrichment in the pathway analyses, a number of other loci were located in
regions with functional links to genes involved in Wnt signalling, including 1p13.2, where
rs2999158 (lingual SA, P = 1.9 x 10-11, Prep = 3.0 x 10-11; pericalcarine SA, P = 1.9 x 10-11;
Prep = 9.9 x 10-16) is an eQTL for for ST7L and WNT2B (minimum PADULT = 9.0 x 10-3) in
adult cortex (Tables S10–S11). A number of our novel regional associations occur near genes
with known roles in brain development. For example, on chromosome 1p22.2, rs1413536
(inferior parietal SA: P = 1.6 x 10-10; Prep = 3.1 x 10-14) is an eQTL in adult cortex for LMO4
(PADULT = 9.0 x 10-3), with chromatin interactions between the region housing both this SNP
and rs59373415 (precuneus SA: Prep = 5.3 x 10-12) and the LMO4 promoter in neural
progenitor cells (Table S10–S11). Lmo4 is one of the few genes already known to be
involved in areal identity specification in mammalian brain(44).
Genetic correlations with other traits
To examine shared genetic effects between cortical structure and other traits, we performed
genetic correlation analyses with GWAS summary statistics from 23 selected traits. We
observed significant positive genetic correlations between total SA and general cognitive
function(45), educational attainment(21), and Parkinson’s disease(46). For total SA,
significant negative genetic correlations were detected with insomnia(47), attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)(48), depressive symptoms(49), major depressive
disorder(50), and neuroticism(51)(Fig. 5A; Table S14). Genetic correlations with average TH
did not survive multiple testing correction due to the weaker genetic association seen in the
TH analyses. We mapped genetic correlation patterns across the cortical regions without
correction for the global measures to map the magnitude of these effects across the brain (Fig.
5B). No additional neuropsychiatric or psychological traits were significant at a regional
level.

Discussion
Here we present a large-scale collaborative investigation of the effects of common genetic
variation on human cortical structure using data from 51,662 individuals from 60 cohorts
from around the world. We identify specific loci influencing cortical surface area (187 loci
surviving multiple testing) and thickness (12 loci), implicating genes involved in areal
patterning and cortical development. Our results support the radial unit hypothesis of surface
area expansion in humans(3): genetic variation within regulatory elements in fetal neural
progenitor cells(16) is associated with variability in adult cortical surface area. We also find
that Wnt signalling genes influence areal expansion in humans, as has been reported in model
organisms such as mice(6). Cortical thickness was associated with loci near genes implicated
in cell differentiation, migration, adhesion, and myelination. Consequently, molecular studies
in the appropriate tissues, such as neural progenitor cells and their differentiated neurons, will
be critical to map the involvement of specific genes. Genetic variation associated with brain
structure is functionally relevant, as evidenced by genetic correlations with a range of
neuropsychiatric disorders and psychological traits, including general cognitive function,
Parkinson’s disease, depression, ADHD and insomnia. This work identifies novel genomewide significant loci associated with cortical surface area and thickness based on the largest
imaging genetics study to date, providing a deeper understanding of the genetic architecture
of the human cerebral cortex and its patterning.

Materials and Methods
Ethical approval and data availability
Participants in all cohorts in this study gave written informed consent and sites involved
obtained approval from local research ethics committees or Institutional Review Boards.
Ethics approval for the meta-analysis was granted by the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research
Institute Human Research Ethics Committee (approval: P2204).
Imaging
Measures of cortical surface area (SA) and thickness (TH) were derived from in-vivo whole
brain T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using FreeSurfer MRI
processing software(1) (Table S3). SA and TH were quantified for each subject within 34
distinct gyral-defined regions in each brain hemisphere according to the Desikan-Killiany
atlas(9) (Fig. 1A). SA was measured at the grey-white matter boundary. TH was measured as
the average distance between the white matter and pial surfaces. The total SA and average
TH of each hemisphere was computed separately. High test-retest correlations have been
reported for all measures with the exception of the frontal and temporal poles(5). Image
processing and quality control were implemented at the cohort level following detailed,
harmonized protocols (see http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/imaging-protocols/ for
protocols); phenotype distributions for all traits in all cohorts were inspected centrally prior to
meta-analysis. Any cohort where the phenotypic distribution for a given trait showed
deviation from expectations that could not be resolved through reanalysis or outlier
inspection were excluded from analyses of that trait.
Genome-wide association analyses
At each site, genotypes were imputed using either the 1000 Genomes Project(52) or
Haplotype Reference Consortium(53) references (Table S4). To ensure consistency in the
correction for ancestry and stability of the correction given the relatively small sample sizes,
each cohort also ran the same multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis protocol in which the
data from the HapMap 3 populations were merged with the site level data and MDS
components were calculated across this combined data set. Within each cohort, genome-wide
association (GWAS) was conducted using an additive model including covariates to control
for the effects of age, sex, ancestry (the first four MDS components), diagnostic status (when
the cohort followed a case-control design), and scanner (when multiple scanners were used at
the same site).
The primary GWAS of regional measures included the global measure of SA or TH as an
additional covariate, to test for genetic influences specific to each region. However, to aid
interpretation, the regional GWAS were also run without controlling for global measures.
Cohort level GWAS results underwent quality control (excluding variants with an imputation
R2 ≤ .5 and MAF ≤ .005). Across all cohorts, for each phenotype, GWAS summary plots
(Manhattan and QQ plots) were visually inspected by the central analysis group, if a given
trait showed deviation from expectations that could not be resolved through reanalysis that
cohort was excluded from analyses of that trait.
Multiple testing correction
We analysed 70 traits (total SA, average TH, and the SA and TH of 34 cortical regions
averaged across right and left hemispheres). However, after accounting for the correlation
between the traits in the UK Biobank (residuals correcting for sex, age, ancestry and global

measures) using matrix spectral decomposition (matSpD(10)) the effective number of traits
was estimated to be 60. Therefore, we applied the significance threshold of P ≤ 8.3 x 10-10 to
correct for multiple testing in the GWAS meta-analysis results. Multiple testing corrections
applied to each of the follow-up analyses are described below.
Meta-analysis
The initial meta-analysis was conducted on all of the ENIGMA European cohorts with
genome-wide imputed data, which were then meta-anlysed with the UK Biobank European
participants to give the principal results. We took the significant principal results and metaanalysed them with an additional ENIGMA cohort and results from the CHARGE
consortium. In an additional replication we took these results and meta-analysed them with
the ENIGMA non-European cohorts. Cohort information is provided in Table S2. All metaanalyses were conducted using METAL(54). The results of the meta-analysis are summarized
in Table S5. For the intial and principal meta-analyses we used standard error weighted metaanalyses. In the replication steps we used sample size weighted meta-analyses, in order to
include results from the CHARGE consortium for which only sample size weighted results
were available. For each meta-analysis, the results were quality controlled, removing strand
ambiguous SNPs and INDELs where the effect allele frequency crossed .5, and (for the initial
meta-analysis) variants where the total sample size was < 10,000. Independent loci were
identified by clumping significant loci in PLINK(55), with thresholds of 1 Mb and r2 < .2.
For the chromosome 17 inversion region this was increased to 10 Mb. For clumping, a
random sample of 5,000 unrelated individuals from the UK BioBank were used as an LD
reference.
Following Rietveld et al(56), we estimated the variance explained R2 by each variant j as:
2𝑝𝑗 𝑞𝑗 . 𝛽̂𝑗2
𝑅𝑗2 ≈
𝜎̂𝑦2
where pj and qj are the minor and major allele frequencies, 𝛽̂𝑗 is the estimated effect of the
variant within the meta-analysis and 𝜎̂𝑦2 is the estimated variance of the trait (for which we
used the pooled variance of the trait across all ENIGMA cohorts and UK Biobank; see Table
S1). To obtain beta and standard error estimates from the results from the sample size
weighted meta-analyses reported in Table S5 we used the following equations from Rietveld
et al(56):
𝜎̂𝑦
𝑧𝑗
𝛽̂𝑗 ≈ 𝑧𝑗 ∙
and 𝑆𝐸(𝛽̂𝑗 ) ≡
𝛽̂𝑗
√𝑁𝑗 ∙ 2𝑝𝑗 𝑞𝑗
Where zj is the Z-score and SE (𝛽̂𝑗 ) is the estimated standard effect of the variant within the
meta-analysis and N is the number of contributing alleles.
Analyses of UK Biobank data
Analyses of the UK Biobank cohort were conducted on the 2018 (version 3) imputed
genotypes, imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium and merged UK10K and 1000
Genomes (phase 3) panels. UK Biobank bulk imaging data were made available for 12,962

Gene-based association analyses
We conducted genome-wide gene-based association analysis using the principal metaanalytic results. We used the 19,427 protein-coding genes from the NCBI 37.3 gene
definitions as the basis for the gene-based association analysis using MAGMA(57). For each
gene we selected all SNPs within exonic, intronic and untranslated regions as well as SNPs
within 50 kb upstream and downstream of the gene. After SNP annotation, there were 18,048
genes that were covered by at least one SNP. Gene-based association tests were performed
taking LD between SNPs into account. We applied a Bonferroni correction to account for
multiple testing, adjusting for the number of genes tested as well as the number of traits
tested (60 independent traits), setting the genome-wide threshold for significance at 4.5 x
10−8. These results are shown in Table S6.
Heritability due to common variants, genetic correlations and partitioned heritability
We used LD score regression(58, 59) to estimate the proportion of variance accounted for by
common SNPs or SNP heritability (h2SNP) of the global measures (total SA and average TH)
and the SA and TH of each of the 34 cortical regions. These results are shown in Table S7.
LD score regression(59) was also used to estimate genetic correlations between regions and
with global measures. These results are shown in Table S1213. We used a threshold of P ≤
8.3 x 10-4 (.05/60) to correct for multiple testing in the genetic and phenotypic correlations
shown in Fig. 3. To identify patterns of genetic correlations of SA and TH (both with and
without correction for global measures), we used Mclust(60) for hierarchical cluster analysis,
which uses expectation-maximisation to fit parameterized Gaussian mixture models to the
data. The best-fitting model for number and shape of clusters was selected as the one with the
largest Bayesian Information Criterion. These results are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.
Partitioned heritability analysis was used to estimate the percentage of heritability explained
by annotated regions of the genome(61). Annotations were derived from either Epigenomics
Roadmap(17) or a study of chromatin accessibility in mid-fetal brains(16). For analyses using
Epigenomics Roadmap data, chromatin states (15 state model) were downloaded for available
tissue types (http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/chr_state_learning.html). For each
tissue, genomic regions comprising all active regulatory elements (TssA, TssAflnk, Enh,
EnhG) within each tissue type were added as an additional annotation to the baseline model
provided with the LDSC package (https://github.com/bulik/ldsc). For analyses using
chromatin accessibility in mid-fetal brains, the genomic coordinates of peaks more accessible
in the germinal zone than the cortical plate (GZ > CP) and peaks more accessible in the
cortical plate than the germinal zone (CP > GZ) were added separately to the baseline
annotations. Partitioned heritability and the enrichment of heritability explained in these
annotations was run using LD score regression(61). The significance of enrichment was
corrected across all annotations used (including those not displayed) using false discovery
rate (FDR) and the enrichment scores were plotted as a heatmap for those that survived
significance (Fig. 2b).
Genetic correlations were calculated to determine if shared genetic influences contributed to
both cortical structure and neuropsychiatric disorders or psychological traits. Summary
statistics were downloaded from the following published genome-wide association studies:
general cognitive function(45), insomnia(47), antisocial behavior(62), educational
attainment(21), subjective well-being(49), depressive symptoms(49), neuroticism(51),
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)(48), autism(63), bipolar disorder(64),
anorexia nervosa(65), major depressive disorder(50), obsessive compulsive disorder(66),
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)(67), schizophrenia(68), anxiety disorders(69),

aggression(70), Alzheimer's disease(71), loneliness(72), cigarettes smoked per day(73),
epilepsy(74), Parkinson's disease(46), and frontotemporal dementia(75). LD score regression
was used to calculate genetic correlations(58). Significance was corrected for multiple
comparisons using FDR across all genetic correlations with average TH and total SA, and
significant associations were highlighted in Fig. 5A. To explore regional variability in those
significant genetic correlations, genetic correlations were conducted between the trait and the
cortical regions (without correcting for global measures) are depicted in Fig. 5B.
Multivariate GWAS analysis
We used TATES(34) to conduct two multivariate analyses: one for the 34 regional SA
measures, and one for the 34 regional TH measures. These analyses were run on the metaanalytic results from the second phase of meta-analysis. Briefly, TATES combines the pvalues from univariate GWAS while correcting for the phenotypic correlations between traits
and does not require access to raw genotypic data(34). The power of TATES has been shown
to be similar or greater than that of multivariate tests using raw data across a range of
scenarios for analyses of 20 or more traits(76). For these analyses, we used phenotypic
correlations calculated from the UK Biobank cohort (residuals correcting for sex, age,
ancestry, and global brain measures).
Gene-set enrichment analyses
Gene-set enrichment analyses were performed on total SA and average TH as well as the
multivariate GWAS results for SA and TH using DEPICT(77). Within DEPICT, groups of
SNPs were assessed for enrichment in 14,462 gene-sets. These analyses were run using
variants with P ≤ 1.0 x 10-5. Gene-set enrichment analyses were considered significant if they
survived FDR correction (q ≤ 0.05)(77). These results are shown in Table S9.
Functional annotation
Potential functional impact was investigated for lead variants and their proxies (defined here
as r2 > 0.6 to the lead SNP) at each of the 306 loci nominally associated with global and
regional SA and TH using a number of publicly available data sources. The majority of the
SNP annotations were as provided by FUMA(23) which annotates:
 SNP location (e.g., genic/intergenic)
 the potential for functional effects through predicted effects as determined by
CADD(78) and Regulome(79)
 expression quantitative trait (eQTL) effects. We considered eQTLs within cortical
structures from GTEx v7, the UK Brain Expression Consortium
(http://www.braineac.org/), and the CommonMind Consortium(80), and
PsychENCODE(81) (http://resource.psychencode.org)
 chromatin state
 the presence of enhancers and promoters in SNP regions (RoadMap tissues E053,
E073, E081, E082, E125)
 chromatin state (see below) and interactions in numerous brain tissues (GEO
GSE87112). We included data for dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and neural progenitor
cells, PsychENCODE, and adult and fetal cortex(82).
In the main text we provide P-values for adult cortical eQTLs as calculated by FUMA across
tissues in which significant eQTLs were observed (Table S11). These data were used by
FUMA to map coding and non-coding (e.g. lncRNA) genes to each lead SNP based on an
eQTL effect with an FDR correction P ≤ .05 in cortical tissue, and/or chromatin interactions
between the region harbouring the lead SNP and a gene promoter in a second chromosomal
region (including interactions with an FDR correction P ≤ 1 x 10-6)(23). HaploReg(83) was

used to annotate transcription factor binding across multiple tissues, and whether SNPs
modified transcription factor binding motifs. The potential for a detrimental effect on protein
function due to lead or proxy SNPs located within gene exons was investigated using SIFT
and PolyPhen as reported by SNPNexus(80). Fetal eQTL data were taken from O’Brien et
al(26): we have noted only those eQTLs passing our FDR correction (P ≤ .05) of the
nomimal P-values provided in the original publication. In the main text we provide the
nominal P-values as reported by O’Brien et al.
In Fig. 4 we annotate the genomic context of rs1080066 and high LD proxies associated with
additional traits, chromatin state in relevant tissues, and gene expression in pre- and postnatal brains. Chromatin state represents the degree to which 200 bp genomic regions are
accessible for transcription. Around each of our associated loci chromatin state was annotated
by FUMA(23) utilising the core 15-state model (Table S10). In Fig. 4, genomic regions in
three tissues/cells most relevant to our study (RoadMap E073 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[Adult cortex], E081 female fetal brain [Fetal brain], and E125 NH-A Astrocytes Primary
Cells [Astrocytes]) are indicated as one of the 15 possible chromatin states as predicted by
Roadmap Epignomics using ChromHMM, based on data for 5 chromatin marks (H3K4me3,
H3K4me1, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3) in 127 epigenomes(17). Chromatin states
are as follows: TssA:Active Transcription Start Site (TSS); TssAFlnk:Flanking Active TSS;

expression data across multiple brain regions was obtained from the BrainSpan Atlas of the

information for cortical tissues indicated on a scale from low (dark blue) to high (dark red)
expression on a log2 RPKM scale (RPKM = Reads Per Kilobase [of transcript per] Million
[mapped reads], which normalises expression levels to account for sequencing depth and
gene length). The BRAINSPAN cortical tissues, organised in ontological order, are as
follows: DFC:dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; VFC:ventrolateral prefrontal cortex;
MFC:anterior (rostral) cingulate (medial prefrontal) cortex; OFC:orbital frontal cortex;
M1C:primary motor cortex (area M1, area 4); M1C-S1C:primary motor-sensory cortex
(samples); PCx:parietal neocortex; S1C:primary somatosensory cortex (area S1, areas 3,1,2);
IPC:posteroventral (inferior) parietal cortex; A1C:primary auditory cortex (core);
TCx:temporal neocortex; STC:posterior (caudal) superior temporal cortex (area 22c);
ITC:inferolateral temporal cortex (area TEv, area 20); Ocx:occipital neocortex; V1C:primary
visual cortex (striate cortex, area V1/17).
For each locus, we evaluated functional annotations for the lead SNP and for additional SNPs
considered to be credible causal variants (CCVs) if they were either i) in reasonable LD (r2 ≥
0.6 in individuals of European ancestry) with the lead SNP and/or ii) had P-values within 2
orders of magnitude of the lead SNP. As lincRNAs show considerable cell/tissue specificity,
in the main text we detail SNP location based on neighbouring coding genes, but detail
lincRNAs when our lead SNPs show eQTL effects and/or chromatin interactions to these
non-coding transcripts. Genes at each associated locus were determined to be potential
candidates by considering whether the lead SNP (or a proxy) was an eQTL for a particular
gene in adult cortical tissue (e.g. BRAINEAC, CMC or GTEx cortical tissues) and/or when
chromatin interactions were observed to occur between the region harbouring the lead/proxy

SNPs and a gene promoter in relevant brain tissues (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and/or
neural progenitor cells).
Analysis of the central sulcus
To follow-up the precentral surface area association with rs1080066, 10,557 UK Biobank
MRI scans were further analyzed using BrainVISA-4.5 Morphologist pipeline for the
extraction and parameterization of the central sulcus. Quality controlled FreeSurfer outputs
(orig.mgz, ribbon.mgz and talairach.auto) were directly imported into the pipeline to use the
same gray and white matter segmentations. Sulci were automatically labeled according to a
predefined anatomical nomenclature of 60 sulcal labels per hemisphere(84, 85). Extracted
meshes for the left and right central sulcus were visually quality checked; subjects with
mislabelled central sulcus were discarded from further analysis; 6,045 individuals had good
quality extractions for both the left and right hemispheres. The central sulcus depth profile
was measured by extending the method introduced in(38, 86). The ridges at the fundus of the
sulcus and at the convex hull, along with the two extremities, were automatically extracted.
Using these landmarks, two coordinate fields (x and y) were extrapolated over the entire
mesh surface(87). Sulcal depth was defined as the distance between paired points at the sulcal
fundus and brain envelope that shared the same y coordinate(88). For each individual, the
parametrized surface was divided into 100 equally spaced points along the length of the
sulcus, and the depth at each point was recorded for comparison. We averaged the
corresponding depth measurements across the left and right sulcus and calculated the effect
of the rs1080066 G allele on the bilaterally averaged depth at each point. These results are
shown in Fig. 4C.
Estimating linkage disequilibrium with the 5-HTTLPR variable number tandem repeat.
Using PLINK(55), we estimated the LD between rs4291964 and the 5-HTTLPR variable
number tandem repeat using data from 807 unrelated founders from the QTIM sample who
are genotyped for 5-HTTLPR and have rs4291964 imputed (imputation accuracy r2 = 0.96).
These analyses showed the two genotypes to be unlinked, r2 = 0.03, D' = 0.267.

Sulcal development
Positive genetic correlations between the SA of neighbouring regions may also be driven by
the development of the sulcus, separating the regions. The pre- and post- central regions (also
known as the primary motor and sensorimotor cortices, respectively) are consistently labelled
across many cortical atlases as the regions directly anterior and posterior to the central sulcus
(which appears early in development(89)). The SA of all four regions surrounding the
calcarine sulcus (the pericalcarine, lingual, cuneus, and lateral occipital region) show positive
genetic correlations. The same is also true for the SA of the insula and superior temporal gyri
surrounding the lateral sulcus (or Sylvian fissure). These major, early-forming sulci show
positive genetic correlations between the regions that directly surround them for SA, but not
TH. These observations may imply that part of the genetic influences we observe to be
underlying regional SA, may actually be driving the formation of the separating folds, or
sulci, during fetal development.
The Desikan-Killiany atlas
The Desikan-Killiany atlas(9) used here to define the 34 regions of interest is one of many
possible atlases. It is one of the coarser atlases, yielding larger, more consistent regions,
defined by the common folding patterns visible on standard MRI. More recent efforts
partitioning the cortex into 180 regions have used high-resolution multimodal assessments

(MMPC)(90). It is possible that positive correlations between adjacent structures may reflect
suboptimal partitioning of the cortex by the Desikan-Killiany atlas into distinct functional
brain regions; for example, we see a positive genetic correlation between the inferior parietal
and the superior parietal gyri, whereas in the MMPC atlas, a portion of each of these two
regions is included under the intraparietal labels. Portions of these genetically correlated
regions may in future be re-assigned based on other advanced imaging data, such as
multimodal myelin mapping, which may better define cortical cellular architecture.

Additional cohort information
ADNI
Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative database. The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a 5-year public–
private partnership to assess and optimize biomarkers for clinical trials in Alzheimer’s
disease. The initial sample included older adults who were cognitive normal (CN) as well as
meeting criteria for MCI and clinical AD. In 2011, ADNI-2 began to recruit an additional CN
group as well as individuals with significant memory concerns (SMC), early MCI and late
MCI,and AD. . These subjects, and others carried forward from ADNI-1, were scanned with
an updated neuroimaging protocol. Participants were recruited from over 60 sites across the
U.S. and Canada. For up-to-date information, please see www.adni-info.org.
ALSPAC
Pregnant women resident in Avon, UK with expected dates of delivery 1st April 1991 to 31st
December 1992 were invited to take part in the study. The initial number of pregnancies
enrolled is 14,541 (for these at least one questionnaire has been returned or a “Children in
Focus” clinic had been attended by 19/07/99). Of these initial pregnancies, there was a total
of 14,676 fetuses, resulting in 14,062 live births and 13,988 children who were alive at 1 year
of age. When the oldest children were approximately 7 years of age, an attempt was made to
bolster the initial sample with eligible cases who had failed to join the study originally. As a
result, when considering variables collected from the age of seven onwards (and potentially
abstracted from obstetric notes) there are data available for more than the 14,541 pregnancies
mentioned above. The number of new pregnancies not in the initial sample (known as Phase I
enrolment) that are currently represented on the built files and reflecting enrolment status at
the age of 18 is 706 (452 and 254 recruited during Phases II and III respectively), resulting in
an additional 713 children being enrolled. The phases of enrolment are described in more
detail in the cohort profile paper (see footnote 4 below). The total sample size for analyses
using any data collected after the age of seven is therefore 15,247 pregnancies, resulting in
15,458 fetuses. Of this total sample of 15,458 fetuses, 14,775 were live births and 14,701
were alive at 1 year of age. A 10% sample of the ALSPAC cohort, known as the Children in
Focus (CiF) group, attended clinics at the University of Bristol at various time intervals
between 4 to 61 months of age. The CiF group were chosen at random from the last 6 months
of ALSPAC births (1432 families attended at least one clinic). Excluded were those mothers
who had moved out of the area or were lost to follow-up, and those partaking in another study
of infant development in Avon. The data used in the present study were collected from 391
males and further description of this subset and the variables used in this study are provided
in Supplementary Tables 2–4.
