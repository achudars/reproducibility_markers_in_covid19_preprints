New anti-cancer therapeutics require extensive in vivo characterization to identify endogenous

18

and exogenous factors affecting efficacy, to measure toxicity and mutagenicity, and to determine

19

genotypes resulting in therapeutic sensitivity or resistance. We used Caenorhabditis elegans as a

20

platform with which to characterize properties of anti-cancer therapeutic agents in vivo. We

21

generated a map of chemigenetic interactions between DNA damage response mutants and

22

common DNA damaging agents. We used this map to investigate the properties of the new anti-

23

cancer therapeutic CX-5461. We phenocopied the photoreactivity observed in CX-5461 clinical

24

trials and found that CX-5461 generates reactive oxygen species when exposed to UVA

25

radiation. We demonstrated that CX-5461 is a mutator, resulting in both large copy number

26

variations and a high frequency of single nucleotide variations (SNVs). CX-5461-induced SNVs

27

exhibited a distinct mutational signature. Consistent with the wide range of CX-5461-induced

28

mutation types, we found that multiple repair pathways were needed for CX-5461 tolerance.

agent with strong similarity to ellipticines, a class of antineoplastic agents, and to anthracycline-

INTRODUCTION

6

Cancer is driven by genetic and environmental factors. These factors can enhance or suppress the

7

efficacy of anti-cancer therapeutics. Key to the adoption of targeted anticancer therapies is an

8

understanding of the interactions between therapeutic agents, the tumour genotype and the

9

tumour environment. For example, many anti-cancer therapeutics are mutagenic either as their

10

primary mode-of-action or as a side-effect and some undergo xenobiotic metabolism to form

11

new metabolites with different properties from the original drug [1,2]. For these reasons, the

12

properties of anti-cancer therapeutics need to be assayed to determine: 1) mechanisms of action,

13

2) genetic alterations affecting therapeutic sensitivity and resistance, 3) mutagenicity and 4) the

14

effect of environment on the therapeutic agent.

15
16

Chemotherapeutic genotoxicity and efficacy can be dependent on genotype. Screening for

17

therapeutic-sensitive and -resistant genotypes can identify tumour-specific genetic biomarkers

18

and add to the understanding of the mechanism of anti-cancer therapeutics. Many

19

pharmacogenomic screens have been conducted in human cell lines using RNAi, or

20

more recently, CRISPR sgRNA libraries, to identify anti-cancer chemi-genetic interactions [3–

21

7]. While useful, the genotypes of many cell lines are not well characterized and can evolve

22

because of genomic instability. A more genetically stable, near isogenic assay system could be

23

utilized to take a more reductive approach to determine chemi-genetic interactions with new

potential therapeutics.

3

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive animal model with which to characterize

4

the properties of anticancer therapeutics. The small size, ease of handling, and powerful genetic

5

tools of C. elegans provide a sophisticated in vivo platform that combines the technical

6

advantages of a microorganism with greater biological complexity. C. elegans has been used to

7

screen for and characterize compounds affecting meiosis [8,9] and development [10]. C. elegans

8

has also proven useful for determining mutational frequencies and signatures of DNA damage

9

response (DDR) mutants and genotoxic agents [11–15].

10
11

We used C. elegans to characterize the in vivo properties of CX-5461, a promising anti-cancer

12

therapeutic currently in clinical trials [16,17]. CX-5461 was first described as an orally

13

bioavailable RNA Pol I inhibitor that exhibited anti-tumour activity in murine xenograft models

14

[18] and was the first RNA Pol I inhibitor to be tested in clinical trials [17]. CX-5461 also

15

stimulates ATM/ATR activation [19], and rapamycin-associated signaling [20]. More recently, it

16

was found that homologous recombination deficient cancer cells are sensitive to CX-5461 and

17

that this sensitivity may be due to the stabilization of G-quadruplex forming DNA structures that

18

could affect DNA replication [21]. This has led to a clinical trial focusing on patients with

19

homology-directed repair (HDR)-deficient tumours [16]. However, the mechanisms underlying

20

the tumour cell killing and the in vivo properties of CX-5461 are still unclear.

21
22

We assayed CX-5461-mediated photosensitivity, mutagenicity, mutational signatures, and

23

identified genotypes that are sensitive to CX-5461. We found that CX-5461 is a multimodal

genotoxic agent with similarities to antineoplastic ellipticine and anthracycline-based anti-cancer

agents. A better understanding of CX-5461 can lead to more informed treatment approaches.

RESULTS

4

CX-5461 is a photosensitizer that generates ROS upon exposure to UVA

5

Photosensitivity is a common side-effect of many therapeutics [22]. Clinical trials evaluating

6

CX-5461 in patients with hematologic or advanced solid tumors reported cases of

7

photosensitivity [16,17]. We used C. elegans as an in vivo model to investigate the

8

photosensitivity of CX-5461. We focused on the effect of UVA radiation on CX-5461 for several

9

reasons: 1) CX-5461 absorbs UVA and UVB radiation, 2) other quinolone-based molecules can

10

trigger photosensitivity upon UVA irradiation [22], 3) UVA passes through clouds and glass,

11

accounting for more than 90% of the UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface, and 4) UVA

12

penetrates deep into the dermis and triggers chemical-induced photosensitivity.

13
14

First, we attempted to re-create the CX-5461-induced photosensitivity in wild-type C. elegans.

15

Young adult animals were exposed to CX-5461 for ~16 hours and then exposed to UVA

16

radiation. Photosensitivity was measured by assessing the viability of F1 progeny from exposed

17

animals. Wild-type animals were not sensitive to CX-5461 or UVA alone but were sensitive to

18

CX-5461 + UVA exposure (Figure 1A). Increasing either the concentration of CX-5461 or the

19

amount of UVA radiation enhanced the cytotoxicity in a dose dependent manner (Figure 1A). To

20

assess if the photosensitivity was limited to the germline, we assayed CX-5461 photosensitivity

21

in L1 larvae. Synchronized L1 larvae were arrested by starvation and treated with 100 µM CX-

22

5461 for ~16 hours followed by exposure to 300 J/m2 UVA radiation. Photosensitivity was

23

measured by assessing the developmental stage of the population after 96 hours. L1 wild-type

1

animals were not sensitive to CX-5461 or UVA alone but were sensitive to CX-5461 + UVA

2

exposure with many animals failing to develop to the adult stage (Figure 1B). To test if CX-5461

3

photosensitivity was conserved in other species, we assayed UVA-mediated CX-5461

4

photosensitivity in mismatch repair defective and proficient human cancer cell lines (HCT116

5

and HT29, respectively) and in wild-type and homologous recombination defective budding

6

yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Both human colorectal cancer cell lines exhibited UVA-

7

induced dose-dependent CX-5461-mediated photosensitivity (Figure 1C). Similarly, wild-type

8

and rad52 yeast also exhibited dose-dependent CX-5461-mediated photosensitivity (Figure 1D).

9
10

The phototoxicity of some fluoroquinolones can be attributed to the generation of reactive

11

oxygen species (ROS) after exposure to UVA radiation [23]. To determine whether CX-5461

12

generated ROS upon UVA radiation, we used 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein

13

diacetate (H2DCFDA) as an intracellular fluorescent probe to measure ROS [24] in CX-5461 +

14

UVA exposed C. elegans. We observed a significant dose-dependent ROS increase in worms

15

treated with CX-5461 followed by UVA exposure (Figure 1E and 1F). Increasing UVA or CX-

16

5461 increased the amount of ROS produced (Figure 1E and 1F). Taken together, these data

17

suggest that CX-5461 is a photosensitizer that results in cytotoxicity due to the production of

18

ROS.

CX-5461 exposure results in SNVs and GCRs

21

CX-5461 has been shown to stabilize G-quadruplexes [21]. G-quadruplex stabilization can cause

22

replication-associated mutagenic events [11,25–27]. To characterize the frequency and spectrum

23

of mutagenic events induced by CX-5461 and CX-5461 + UVA, we used a genetic balancer in

1

wild-type C. elegans to capture and characterize CX-5461-induced lethal mutations in the

2

presence and absence of UVA. The eT1 balancer is a reciprocal translocation of approximately

3

half of chromosome III and half of chromosome V and can capture both single nucleotide

4

variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) in balanced regions, including terminal

5

deletion events and translocations [15].

6
7

Exposure to CX-5461 or CX-5461 + UVA resulted in high frequencies of balanced lethal

8

mutations and dominant sterile F1 animals, which produced no progeny (Figure 2A). Four

9

balanced recessive lethal mutations were recovered from a screen of 200 F1 progeny from

10

individuals treated with 100 µM CX-5461. UVA radiation increased the mutagenicity of CX-

11

5461 more than four-fold. Nineteen balanced recessive lethal mutations were recovered from a

12

screen of 200 F1 progeny from individuals treated with 100 µM CX-5461 + 100 J/m2 of UVA

13

radiation.

14
15

To elucidate the mutational signatures of CX-5461 and CX-5461 + UVA, we sequenced the

16

genomes of the 23 strains with eT1-balanced lethal mutations. The CX-5461-treated genomes

17

contained a range of mutation types, including large copy number variations (CNVs) and single

18

nucleotide variations (SNVs). First, we analyzed the mutations in the balanced regions to

19

identify the lesions responsible for the lethal phenotype. In the CX-5461 mutated strains, 9/23

20

contained large copy number variations in the balanced regions that could account for the

21

lethality (Table 1; Supplemental Figures 1-2) and 14/23 strains contained SNVs in essential

22

genes (Table 1).

Analysis of CX-5461-induced CNVs

1

Most CX-5461- and CX-5461 + UVA-treated genomes contained at least one CNV. CNVs

2

ranged from simple deletions to complex events involving deletions, duplications, and

3

translocations (Supplemental Figure 1 and 2). The high frequency of CX-5461-induced CNVs

4

was consistent with the observation that DNA double strand break repair genes, such as the

5

homology-directed repair (HDR) gene brc-2 and the microhomology mediated end-joining

6

(MMEJ) gene polq-1, are required for CX-5461 tolerance in C. elegans [21]. CNV breakpoints

7

frequently contained regions of microhomology consistent with MMEJ (Table1; Figure 2B).

8

Analysis of the regions surrounding the CNV breakpoints found DNA repeats (simple, tandem,

9

and inverted) flanking some of the breakpoints.

10

Analysis of CX-5461-induced SNVs

11

All CX-5461-exposed genomes contained a high frequency of heterozygous and homozygous

12

SNVs (Table 1). Genomes exposed to CX-5461 + UVA had more homozygous and heterozygous

13

SNVs in the balanced region compared to those exposed to CX-5461 alone (Figure 2C). The

14

increased frequency of SNVs in the CX-5461 + UVA treated genomes was consistent with the

15

increased frequency of balanced lethal mutations.

16
17

All 4,284 SNVs were included in the analysis because there were no obvious differences in the

18

characteristics of the mutational profiles of heterozygous or homozygous SNVs or between the

19

CX-5461 and CX-5461 + UVA-induced SNVs. The SNVs were distributed throughout the

20

genome with no bias for coding or non-coding regions (Figure 2D) or chromosome location

21

(Supplemental Figure 3; Supplemental Table 1). 517 SNVs (12%) were present in 212 multi-

22

nucleotide mutation (MNM) clusters consisting of 2-13 SNVs within a 1000 bp region. More

23

than 80% of the SNVs in MNMs were less than 15 bases from the neighboring mutations (Figure

7

2E). It was possible that the SNVs were the product of repair or bypass of CX-5461-stabilized G-

2

quadruplexes, so we searched 100 bases 5’ and 3’ of each SNV for G-quadruplex forming

3

structures using QuadBase2 webserver [28]. SNVs were not strongly correlated with G-

4

quadruplex forming sequences. Only 0.75% of mutations flanking regions contained predicted

5

G-quadruplexes compared to 0.45% in a control set of EMS mutations from the Million

6

Mutation Project [29].

7
8

CX-5461-induced SNVs exhibited a distinct mutational signature. Greater than 80% of the SNVs

9

were A to X changes with nearly 50% being A to T transversions (Figure 2F). To better

10

understand the mutagenicity of CX-5461, we used the pLogo, a probability Logo generator, to

11

examine the extended sequence context of the A to X mutations [30]. We observed changes in the

12

frequency of bases both 5’ and 3’ of the mutated adenine. Most notably, 70% of the bases

13

immediately 3’ (+1 position) of the mutated adenine were thymine. Guanine was overrepresented

14

in the +2 position and cytosine was overrepresented in the -1 and -2 positions. In contrast, no

15

extended sequence context was detected flanking mutated guanine (Figure 2G). Although there

16

was a higher frequency of SNVs in the CX-5461 + UVA samples compared to CX-5461

17

genomes, we saw no difference in the types of SNVs suggesting that UVA exposure enhanced

18

the frequency of CX-5461-induced SNVs but did not change the mutational mechanism.

19
20

To identify sequence motifs that may be more prone to CX-5461 mutagenesis, we looked for

21

sites that were mutated in more than one line. Forty-seven sites were mutated in two or more

22

lines (127 SNVs). We analyzed 100 bases flanking each of the frequently-mutated sites for

23

sequences predicted to form secondary structures and found 25/47 flanking regions contained

8

1

inverted or tandem repeats (53%). For comparison, a similar analysis of 3,719 regions flanking

2

EMS-induced mutations from the Million Mutation Project [29] found 753 repeats (20.2%).

3

From this, it appears that CX-5461-induced mutations are more common in regions containing

4

tandem or inverted repeats.

5
6

CX-5461 intercalates into DNA

7

The broad distribution of CX-5461-induced mutations suggested that CX-5461 can affect DNA

8

even in the absence of G-quadruplex structures. Previous in silico analysis predicted that the

9

pharmacophore of CX-5461 can intercalate into a crystal structure of DNA (PDB code 1Z3F)

10

[31] in a manner similar to the antineoplastic agent ellipticine [32]. To test whether CX-5461

11

could intercalate into DNA, we incubated CX-5461 with a PCR-generated dsDNA and

12

visualized the migration of DNA on a 1% agarose gel with the dsDNA-specific dye SYBR-Safe.

13

Incubation of the dsDNA with CX-5461 resulted in a slower migrating DNA band suggesting

14

that intercalation had occurred (Figure 3A). The disruption of dsDNA was greater when the

15

DNA was denatured and reannealed in the presence of CX-5461. At higher concentrations, the

16

DNA-CX-5461 complex did not migrate into the gel (Figure 3A).

17
18

Intercalation of ellipticine into DNA results in partial unwinding and distortion of the DNA

19

duplex [31]. To determine whether CX-5461 intercalation distorted DNA structure and whether

20

G-quadruplex sequences were required, we incubated a PCR product predicted to form a G

21

quadruplex (G4) and a PCR product without a predicted G quadruplex (non-G4) with mung bean

22

nuclease (MBN), which cleaves single-stranded or distorted double-stranded DNA, for one hour

23

at the specified temperature and assessed the endonuclease activity on a 1% Syber-Safe

6

Genotypic sensitivities to CX-5461

7

The high frequency of both SNVs and CNVs suggested that the DNA damage response to CX-

8

5461 is complex. To further characterize the DNA damage response to CX-5461, we used an

9

acute exposure assay on a panel of 28 C. elegans DNA replication and repair mutants to generate

10

a genetic sensitivity profile for CX-5461. We then compared the CX-5461 sensitivity profile to

11

the profiles of the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (CPT); the topoisomerase II poison

12

etoposide (ETP); the interstrand crosslinking (ICL) agent UVA-activated trimethyl psoralen

13

(UVA-TMP); and UV-C radiation (UV-C), which causes thymine dimers and photoproducts.

14
15

CX-5461 sensitivity was observed in 14 of the 28 DNA damage response mutants tested (Table

16

2). Mutations in genes implicated in replication stress (mus-81, smrc-1, helq-1, brd-1, atm-1,

17

polq-1, polz-1, polh-1, him-1) resulted in sensitivity to CX-5461. The CX-5461 sensitivity profile

18

was distinct from the other DNA damaging agents, sharing some but not all genotypic

19

sensitivities. Of the 14 CX-5461 sensitive strains, 11 were sensitive to UVA-TMP, 9 were

20

sensitive to UV-C, 8 were sensitive to CPT and 8 were sensitive to ETP. Given the overlapping

21

sensitivities of CX-5461 and UVA-TMP, it was surprising that the Fanconi Anemia pathway

22

mutants were not sensitive to CX-5461, demonstrating that CX-5461 does not result in ICLs. The

23

CX-5461 sensitivity profile has similarity to that of the topoisomerase poisons CPT and ETP

(Figure 4A). The main difference being that TLS and NER mutants were very sensitive to CX-

2

5461 and not to either topoisomerase poison.

4

HDR and MMEJ are required for CX-5461 tolerance

5

Mutations affecting the different double strand break repair pathways caused differential

6

sensitivity to topoisomerase poisons and CX-5461. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)

7

mutants were not sensitive to topoisomerase poisons or CX-5461. HDR mutants (brd-1, rfs-1,

8

helq-1) were exquisitely sensitive to CPT but only mildly sensitive to ETP, whereas the MMEJ

9

mutant polq-1 was very sensitive to ETP but not sensitive to CPT. In contrast, mutations

10

affecting either HDR or MMEJ resulted in moderate sensitivity to CX-5461. To test whether

11

HDR and MMEJ were contributing independently to the repair of CX-5461 induced lesions, we

12

tested polq-1 brd-1, rfs-1 polq-1 and helq-1 polq-1 double mutants for increased sensitivity to

13

CX-5461. In all three cases, the double mutants exhibited increased CX-5461 sensitivity

14

suggesting that HDR and MMEJ contributed independently to the repair of CX-5461-induced

15

lesions (Figure 4B).

Replication arrested nucleotide excision repair mutants are sensitive to CX-5461

18

Nucleotide excision repair mutants xpa-1 and ercc-1 were sensitive to CX-5461. NER repairs

bulky single-stranded DNA lesions such as those formed by UV light and some cancer

20

chemotherapeutics. Most NER activity is transcription-coupled (TC-NER). It is possible to assay

21

the effect of DNA damaging agents on transcription-coupled repair by exploiting starvation-

22

induced L1 diapause, in which replication is arrested. L1 larvae with TC-NER defects exposed to

23

transcription-blocking DNA damaging agents are unable to reinitiate development when released

from arrest [33], whereas, DNA damaging agents that do not block transcription reinitiate

2

development. To test whether CX-5461 caused transcription-blocking lesions, we assayed CX-

3

5461 sensitivity in L1 arrested NER mutants. Replication-arrested L1 larvae were exposed to

4

CX-5461 + UVA, released from arrest, and their development stages were assessed 96 hours

5

later. CX-5461 + UVA-treated xpa-1 and ercc-1 L1 larvae failed to develop to later larval stages

6

suggesting that CX-5461 can cause transcription-blocking lesions (Figure 4C). In contrast, the

7

replication-associated CX-5461 hypersensitive mutant, mus-81 could reinitiate development after

8

L1 CX-5461 exposure and developed into sterile adults. These data demonstrate that CX-5461-

9

induced lesions can block both transcription and replication.

10
11

TLS and NER mutants exacerbate CX-5461 photosensitivity

12

To test whether the CX-5461-induced photosensitivity was due, in part, to increased DNA

13

damage or changes in the nature of the DNA damage, we tested select mutants in the panel of C.

14

elegans DNA replication and repair mutants for increased photosensitivity. Most DNA repair

15

mutants were no more photosensitive to CX-5461 + UVA than wild-type animals (Figure 4D).

16

However, the translesion polymerase mutant polz-1 and the nucleotide excision repair mutant

17

xpa-1 exhibited greater embryonic death than expected. These results are consistent with the

18

observation that CX-5461 generates ROS after UVA exposure (Figure 1E and 1F) and TLS and

19

NER are required for the repair of DNA damage induced by ROS generated by UVA exposure

20

[12].

There are similarities between worms exposed to CX-5461 and worms lacking C. elegans

2

FANCJ ortholog, dog-1. CX-5461 can stabilize G-quadruplexes [21] and the loss of DOG-1

3

results in the formation and/or stabilization of G-quadruplex structures [27]. Furthermore, CX-

4

5461-exposed animals and dog-1 mutants exhibit large and small chromosome rearrangements

5

that often have MMEJ-signatures at the breakpoints [11,34]. To further investigate the

6

similarities between CX-5461 exposure and loss of dog-1, we tested whether loss of dog-1

7

resulted in negative genetic interactions with the CX-5461-sensitive mutants by measuring the

8

viability of dog-1 CX-5461-sensitive double mutants using a generational survival assay (Figure

9

5). The polq-1 mutant was very sensitive to loss of DOG-1 with fewer than 50% of the lines

10

surviving to the third generation. mus-81 and brd-1 mutants were also sensitive to dog-1-induced

11

G-quadruplex stabilization. However, not all CX-5461 sensitive mutants exhibited genetic

12

interaction with dog-1 as the loss of polz-1 did not affect the viability of dog-1 mutants.

DISCUSSION

15

Key to the development of new anti-cancer therapeutic agents is understanding their off-target

16

effects, mechanisms, and genotypic dependencies. While advances in target identification,

17

chemical synthesis, and in vitro analysis have led to improvements in drug development, less

18

progress has been made in improving toxicity and efficacy assays. The most common assay for

19

mutagenicity is the bacteria-based Ames test [35], which has been used to assess the

20

mutagenicity, photomutagenicity, and phototoxicity of chemotherapeutics [36]. The efficacy of

21

the Ames test is limited because bacteria lack many of the genes responsible for the xenobiotic

22

metabolism of drugs, have different DNA damage repair pathways than eukaryotes, and it only

23

assays the reversion frequency of a single mutation. The small size, ease of handling, and

powerful genetic tools of C. elegans provide a sophisticated in vivo toxicity assay that combines

2

the technical advantages of a microorganism with greater biological complexity and a gene

3

complement more akin to human. Furthermore, the cytochrome P450-based metabolic

4

capabilities of C. elegans are broadly similar to those of mammals [37]. For these reasons, C.

5

elegans has been used as an in vivo model system to predict the effect of chemicals on

6

mammalian development [10], germline function [8,9], mutagenicity [13] and toxicity [38]. We

7

have used a complementary suite of mutagenicity, mutational profile, and genotypic sensitivity

8

assays that utilize C. elegans to characterize the new anticancer chemotherapeutic CX-5461.

9

Some anti-cancer drugs, such as vemurafenib, tamoxifen, and docetaxel, and many quinolone-

10

based drugs can cause phototoxic reactions [22,39]. CX-5461, which contains a quinolone

11

backbone, has resulted in photosensitivity in some patients [16,17]. We were able to phenocopy

12

the photosensitivity in C. elegans and determine that the light sensitivity was accompanied by

13

reactive oxygen species-mediated phototoxicity. We demonstrate that C. elegans can be used as

14

an animal model to investigate drug-associated photosensitivity and test genetic and

15

environmental factors affecting photosensitivity and resistance. Given the strong ROS-mediated

16

phototoxicity and drug properties of CX-5461, CX-5461 may be useful for photodynamic

17

anticancer therapy, in which targeted light is used to activate a photosensitizer within cancer cells

18

leading to cell death.

19

C. elegans has proven to be an excellent model with which to investigate the mutagenicity and

20

mutational profiles of DNA damage response mutants or genotoxic compounds [11–13]. CX-

21

5461 was mutagenic and the mutagenicity was increased by exposure to UVA light. The

22

recessive mutation frequencies for CX-5461 and CX-5461 + UVA were comparable to exposure

to 5 mM and 25 mM Ethyl Methane Sulfonate (EMS), a common alkylating mutagen, or 1000

2

and 2500 rads gamma radiation [15].

3
4

A mutational profile is a composite of the mutational events that occurred in a cell and can shed

5

light on the mechanisms of action of DNA interacting compounds. Genetic balancers in C.

6

elegans allow for the capture of a broad range of mutagenic events. CX-5461-treated genomes

7

had a complex mutational profile with individual distinct mutational signatures that included

8

both CNVs and SNVs. The nature of CX-5461-DNA lesions can be inferred from the mutational

9

signature and the genes required for CX-5461 tolerance. For example, it is unlikely that CX-5461

10

generates interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) because loss of the key Fanconi Anemia pathway gene,

11

fcd-2, did not result in CX-5461 sensitivity. Most CX-5461-exposed genomes contained both

12

CNVs and SNVs. CNVs are indicative of DSB formation and repair. The major pathways for the

13

repair of CX-5461-induced DSBs in C. elegans appear to be MMEJ and HDR. Simultaneous loss

14

of both pathways resulted in hypersensitivity to CX-5461. Two of the most informative CX-

15

5461-sensitive mutants are rfs-1 and polq-1. RFS-1 mediates HDR at replication fork blocking

16

lesions but not at IR-induced DSBs [40]. POLQ-1 promotes MMEJ mutagenic bypass of

17

replication fork stalling lesions [12] and dog-1-induced G-quadruplexes [34]. This strongly

18

suggests that CX-5461 does not cause DSBs directly but rather generates replication blocking

19

lesions, which in turn can lead to breaks. This is further supported by the observation that polq-1

20

and rfs-1 and other genes required for the tolerance of CX-5461, such as brd-1, smrc-1, and xpf-1

21

are also involved in the bypass or repair of replication blocking G-quadruplex structures that

22

form in dog-1 mutants [34,40–42] and are essential for the multigenerational survival of dog-1

23

mutants (Figure 5). However, we observed very few G-quadruplex forming sequences in the

15

1

regions flanking SNVs or CNV breakpoints and we demonstrated that CX-5461 can intercalate

2

into non-G-quadruplex forming DNA sequences. Taken together, these data suggest that CX-

3

5461 results in DNA lesions or structures that can stall or collapse replication forks leading to

4

DSBs even in the absence of G-quadruplexes.

5
6

CX-5461 and CX-5461 + UVA exposure resulted in a high frequency of SNVs. The CX-5461 A-

7

N mutation signature was similar to the mutational signature observed in human cancers that

8

have been exposed to aristolochic acid [43,44]. However, the extended sequence context differed

9

between CX-5461 (CATG) and aristolochic acid (T/CAG). Aristolochic acid results almost

10

exclusively in A-T changes, whereas CX-5461 results in A-N changes. The A-T changes in

11

aristolochic are dependent on the translesion polymerase polζ [45]. The high frequency of A-N

12

SNVs, the presence of clustered multinucleotide mutations, and the CX-5461 hypersensitivity of

13

translesion synthesis (TLS) mutants confirm that TLS is needed to bypass CX-5461-induced

14

lesions.

15
16

How might CX-5461 trigger TLS? In silico analysis predicts that the pharmacophore of CX-

17

5461 can intercalate into the DNA sequence CGATCG [32] in a configuration similar to that of

18

the antineoplastic agent ellipticine. When ellipticine intercalates into DNA, there is a slight

19

unwinding of the ApT and a lengthening of the DNA [31], which could be consistent with the gel

20

shifts we observed with DNA incubated with CX-5461. This distortion could make the ApT more

21

prone to TLS-mediated mutagenesis either directly or through secondary reactions with the

22

exposed adenine. Furthermore, both aristolochic acid and ellipticine can form covalent DNA

23

adducts after reductive activation by cytochromes P450. It is possible that CX-5461 forms

16

1

covalent adducts with DNA upon metabolic processing in C. elegans.

2
3

Overall, we found that CX-5461 shares many properties with ellipticine: both can intercalate into

4

DNA [32], induce the formation reactive oxygen species [46], and inhibit RNA Pol I [18,32].

5

Ellipticine inhibits topoisomerase II and can form covalent DNA adducts [47]. These properties

6

are consistent with the effects of CX-5461 on C. elegans but will require further experiments for

7

confirmation. Ellipticine belongs to a family of promising anti-cancer therapeutics with a wide

8

range of cellular effects similar to the anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics such as

9

doxorubicin. However, ellipticines have failed in stage 1 or 2 clinical trials due to adverse side

10

effects [32]. Based on the mechanistic similarities between ellipticine and CX-5461, it is possible

11

that CX-5461 can elicit a similar response as ellipticine in tumour cells with fewer adverse side

12

effects.

13
14

In summary, C. elegans is a powerful platform with which to interrogate the in vivo biological

15

properties of both new and established anticancer therapeutic agents. The mutant panel we

16

assembled and queried with DNA damaging agents provides valuable information about the

17

types of damage generated by new DNA damaging therapeutics. From these data, we find that

18

CX-5461 is a multimodal anticancer agent with mechanistic similarities to ellipticines and

19

anthracyclines. This suggests that CX-5461 may be a more broadly applicable anticancer drug

20

with a therapeutic range beyond HDR-deficient tumours.

UVA irradiation

14

UVA Source: predominantly 365 nm, Black-Ray®UV Bench Lamp (Model: XX-15L). Before

15

each UVA exposure, the light source output was determined by a longwave ultraviolet measuring

16

meter (Model: J-221). Different UVA exposures were achieved by varying the exposure times.

buffer containing OP50, carbenicillin (50 µg/ml) and 1X nystatin for ~18 hours. Following

20

treatment, the animals were allowed to recover for 0.5 h on OP50 containing NGM plates before

21

UVA irradiation (if applicable) and then plated at ten per plate in triplicates on NGM plates for a

Mutagenesis screen for CX-5461

8

Strain BC2200 dpy-18/eT1(III);unc-46/eT1(V) was used in the mutagenesis screen. dpy-

9

18/eT1(III);unc-46/eT1(V) animals were treated with or without 100µM CX-5461 for 18 hours

10

before UVA irradiation, and 200 single dpy-18/eT1(III);unc-46/eT1(V) F1s were picked in each

11

condition. Sterile phenotype at F1 is considered as acquiring a dominant lethal mutation, and

12

lines in which F2 or later generation that do not have Dpy Unc animals are counted as acquiring

13

a recessive lethal mutation on balanced regions of chromosome III or V.

14

Genome Sequencing

15

The lines that acquired recessive lethal mutations were maintained for at least three generations.

16

Worms were rinsed off with deionized water and concentrated. Genomic DNA was purified

17

using Puregene® Core Kit A (Qiagen). DNA-seq was performed at the Novogene

18

Bioinformatics Institute (Beijing, China). Sequence reads were mapped to the C.

custom Perl script and gene information downloaded from WormBase version WS230. Copy

CX-5461 agarose gel shift and mung bean endonuclease assays

7

To test whether CX-5461 could intercalate into DNA, we incubated CX-5461 for one hour at

8

room temperature with a PCR-generated dsDNA fragment and visualized the migration of DNA

9

on a 1% agarose gel containing the dsDNA-specific dye SYBR-Safe. To determine whether CX-

10

5461 affected mung bean endonuclease activity, we incubated a PCR product predicted to form a

11

G quadruplex (G4) and a PCR product without a predicted G quadruplex (non-G4) with mung

12

bean nuclease (MBN), which cleaves single-stranded or distorted double-stranded DNA, for one

13

hour at the specified temperatures and assessed the endonuclease activity on a 1% Syber-Safe

14

containing agarose gel.

15

L1 exposure assay

16

Gravid animals were synchronized in the L1 stage by hypochlorite treatment (0.5M NaOH, 2%

17

hypochlorite). After overnight starvation, approximately 100 L1 larvae of each mutant strain

18

were incubated in 50 µl of M9 buffer containing OP50, carbenicillin (50 µg/ml), 1X nystatin,

19

500 µM NaH2PO4 with and without 100 µM CX5461 for ~18 hours. Following treatment, worms

20

were allowed to recover for 0.5 h on OP50-containing NGM plates before they were irradiated

21

with the indicated amount of UVA exposure. Animals were imaged after 4 days following UVA

22

exposure with 20x using microscope.

Adult worms treated in 100µM CX-5461 for 18 hours were added with 25 µM 2’,7’-

2

dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), and incubated for another hour in dark before

3

initial fluorescence measurement by Microplate reader. After initial measurement, worms were

4

irradiated with the indicated amount of UVA exposure, and then immediately sent for a second

5

measurement [24].

6

Generational survival assay

7

Animals were plated individually and maintained at room temperature. Starting with 20 separate

8

lines at P0 generation, a single L4 stage animal was transferred to a fresh plate at each generation.

9

A line was scored as unsustainable when the parent worm was either sterile or produced only

10

dead embryos.

11

Cell culture and treatment with CX5461

12

HCT116 and HT29 wild-type cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells

13

were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C

14

and 5% CO2. CX5461 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Cells were seeded in 96-well

15

format (6 technical replicates) and after 24 hours, CX5461 (or DMSO) diluted in McCoy’s 5A

16

medium was added to wells. 2 hours post incubation in the drug, cells were exposed to 50J/sqm

17

UVA and allowed to grow for 4 to 5 days. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and

18

stained with Hoechst 33342 before nuclei were counted on Cellomics Arrayscan VTI.

19

Yeast assays

20

Wild-type (BY4742) and rad52Δ yeast strains were diluted from mid-log phase to OD600=0.01 in

21

200µl SC media +/- CX-5461 in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated for 3 hours +/- CX-5461

Figure 3. CX-5461 stabilizes DNA duplex structures. A. CX-5461 binds to and impedes the migration of dsDNA on a 1% agarose
gel. CX-5461 binding is enhanced by DNA denaturation and re-annealing (Lanes 2-6). The effect was less in samples that were
incubated without denaturation and reannealling (Lanes 7-9). B. CX-5461 stabilizes PCR products and the complex was more
resistant to Mung Bean Nuclease (MBN) cleavage.

Figure 4. Genotypic sensitivity to CX-5461. A. Genotypic sensitivity profile of CX-5461. Venn diagram shows that the
CX-5461-sensitive mutants also exhibited sensitivity to other DNA-damaging agents, including the topoisomerase poisons
camptothecin (CPT), and etoposide (ETP). B. Loss of polq-1 sensitizes HDR-associated mutants (brd-1, rfs-1, and helq-1) to
CX-5461. The bar graph showed the embryo survival rate for adult animals treated with the indicated dose of CX-5461.
Student’s t-test *, P<0.05 **, P<0.005, *** P<0.0005 C. UVA enhances the toxicity of CX-5461. The image shows the growth
and development of worms four days after L1 larva-treatment. Upon CX-5461 treatment and UVA irradiation, mus-81 mutants
developed in sterile adults, whereas xpa-1 mutants were arrested in L1. D. Differential sensitivity of worm mutants upon
exposure to CX-5461 + UVA. CX-5461 hypersensitive mutants were tested at low [CX-5461] (Right). Note that xpa-1 and polz-1
are the only mutants that are more sensitive to CX-5461+UVA when normalized to account for the sensitivity to CX-5461 alone.
