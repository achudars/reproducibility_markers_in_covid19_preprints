Abstract
Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are involved in the processing of rewards and rewardpredicting stimuli, possibly analogous to reinforcement learning reward prediction errors. Here
we studied the activity of putative DA neurons (n=41) recorded in the ventral tegmental area of
rats (n=6) performing a behavioural task involving occasion setting. In this task an occasion
setter (OS) indicated that the relationship between a discriminative stimulus (DS) and
reinforcement is in effect, so that reinforcement of bar pressing occurred only after the OS (tone
or houselight) was followed by the DS (houselight or tone). We found that responses of putative
DA cells to the DS were enhanced when preceded by the OS, as were behavioural responses to
obtain rewards. Surprisingly though, we did not find a population response of putative DA
neurons to the OS, contrary to predictions of standard temporal-difference models of DA
neurons. However, despite the absence of a population response, putative DA neurons exhibited
a heterogeneous response on a single unit level, so that some units increased and others
decreased their activity as a response to the OS. Similarly, putative non-DA cells did not respond
to the DS on a population level, but with heterogeneous responses on a single unit level. The
heterogeneity in the responses of putative DA cells may reflect how DA neurons encode context
and point to local differences in DA signalling.

1. Introduction
Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are involved in the processing of rewards and rewardpredicting stimuli. Their function of striatal DA has been proposed to be analogous to
reinforcement learning reward prediction errors (RPEs), i.e. the difference between actual and
predicted rewards (Eshel, Tian, Bukwich, and Uchida, 2016; Montague, Dayan, and Sejnowski,
1996; Schultz, 1998; Schultz, Apicella, and Ljungberg, 1993). The similarity of DA cell activity
and RPEs has been demonstrated in simple classical conditioning tasks. Before learning, DA
cells respond to the unconditioned stimulus, but not to the conditioned stimulus. However,
during learning the response to the unconditioned stimulus gradually decreases, while the
response to the conditioned stimulus gradually increases (Pan, Schmidt, Wickens, and Hyland,
2005). After many repetitions the response to the unconditioned stimulus may even cease,
leaving only a response to the conditioned stimulus. This shift in the response from the
unconditioned to the conditioned stimulus strongly resembles RPEs in simulations of classical
conditioning using temporal-difference learning (Schultz, Dayan, and Montague, 1997), which
has lead to the proposal that DA drives reinforcement learning in the brain (Schultz, 2016;
Steinberg, Keiflin, Boivin, Witten, Deisseroth, and Janak, 2013).
While studies of DA responses to reward-predicting stimuli have used varying reward
probabilities (Fiorillo, Tobler, and Schultz, 2003; Morris, Nevet, Arkadir, Vaadia, and Bergman,
2006) and magnitudes (Tobler, Fiorillo, and Schultz, 2005), reward-predicting stimuli in
configural learning have received less attention (but see Waelti, Dickinson, and Schultz, 2001).
For example, occasion setting, a phenomenon that has long been studied in the fields of learning
and behavior (Fraser and Holland, 2019), has not been investigated in the context of DA neurons
yet. In occasion setting a background stimulus (the occasion setter, OS) indicates that the
relationship between a second stimulus (e.g. a discriminative stimulus, DS) and reinforcement is

in effect. Thus, the presence of the OS indicates that reinforcement is possible, and the absence
of the OS indicates that no reinforcement will occur. At a psychological level, the OS acts as a
modulator of conditioned behaviour triggered by the second stimulus (Bonardi, Robinson, and
Jennings, 2017; Trask, Thrailkill, and Bouton, 2017). Furthermore, the OS can facilitate rewardseeking, rather than merely simplifying ambiguous cue-reward pairings (Fraser and Janak, 2019).
How DA cells respond to the OS and DS in such tasks is interesting because standard
temporal-difference learning models would treat the OS simply as the earliest reward-predicting
stimulus in the sequence of events in a trial (Pan et al., 2005; Schultz et al., 1997), but neglect the
importance of the combination of the OS with the DS. Therefore DA cell responses in occasion
setting tasks may provide guidance for the development of more elaborate state representations
in reinforcement learning algorithms that are employed by the brain (Russek, Momennejad,
Botvinick, Gershman, and Daw, 2017). Furthermore, studying DA cell activity in occasion
setting allows us to address whether DA cell activity also exhibits properties of a motivational
signal. Recent evidence supported that slow, ramping increases in striatal DA are not due to
corresponding firing rate changes in DA neurons (Mohebi, Pettibone, Hamid, Wong, Vinson,
Patriarchi, Tian, Kennedy, and Berke, 2019). However, it has been noted that the type of
behavioural task is a relevant factor for the expression of motivation signals (Berke, 2018), and
they may not be as pronounced in head-fixed animals performing classical conditioning tasks
compared to freely moving animals in operant tasks. As our OS task involved longer time scales,
configural stimuli and operant behaviour, it was also suitable to test whether DA cell exhibits
ramping firing rate increases as expected for motivational signals.
To study how DA cells take into account context for the processing of reward-predicting
stimuli, we employed a behavioural task that involves occasion setting. Based on the RPE
framework we predicted that DA neurons would respond to the OS, since it is the earliest
stimulus in the chain of events leading to reinforcement. We also examined whether responses to

a DS were gated by the presence or absence of an OS, and whether DA cells showed slow,
ramping increases in firing rate towards the reward.

2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
16 Lister Hooded adult male rats (Harlan, UK) were housed in pairs on a light 12h: dark
12 h cycle and weighed 340 to 548 g when training began. Rats were allowed to consume water
from 16.00 h to 17.00 h each weekday and from Friday 16.00 h to Sunday afternoon during
experimental training. During this period, the rats’ body weights were monitored so that none fell
below 85% of their free drinking weight, and all rats gained weight during the course of testing
after minor losses due to surgery and the beginning of the regime of restricted water access.
Following electrode implantation, rats were housed in isolation. All procedures conformed to the
United Kingdom 1986 Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, and ethical clearance was given by
the Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee (AWEC) at the University of St Andrews.

2.2. Behaviour
In general, both the behavioural and neurophysiological methods reported here are
similar to Wilson & Bowman (2006). Training and testing of rats occurred in sound-attenuated
chambers (34 cm · 29 cm · 25 cm; Medical Associates Inc., St Albans, VT, USA), fitted with a
video camera (Santec SmartVision, modelVCA 5156; Sanyo Video Vertrieb GmbH Co.,
Ahrensburg, Germany) for monitoring the rats’ behaviour. Each chamber contained a retractable
lever, drinking spigot, houselight and piezoelectric buzzer (model EW-233A, Medical Associates
Inc.). A reward magazine light (RL) was located in the interior of a reward magazine and
consisted of a white LED (~2072 mcd luminosity). Sodium saccharin solution (0.25% w/v) was

pumped out of the drinking spigot at 0.05 mL/s from a 50-mL glass syringe (Rocket, London) by
computer-controlled syringe pumps (model PHM-100; Medical Associates Inc.)

2.3. Neurophysiology
The electrode arrays contained a movable bundle of four 50-µm stainless steel
microwires coated in Teflon (impedance 0.4-1.3 MΩ). The microwires could be advanced by
~317.5 µm/turn in each recording session by turning an 80-thread/inch set screw (Small Parts
Inc., Miami Lakes, FL, USA). The arrays weighed between 1.3 and 1.4g and measured 6mm
along the mediolateral axis and 11mm along the anteroposterior axis. During recording sessions,
the rat was connected to a preamplifier headstage using field effect transistors (input impedance
100 MΩ, unity gain voltage followers) which was in turn attached via a flexible cable to an
electrical commuter (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA).
In order to remove noise, and lickometer artefacts, neuronal activity was recorded
differentially from each of two pairs of wires. A custom built lickometer was also used to
minimise lickometer artefacts (Malcolm McCandless, University of St Andrews) using a
detection signal of sufficiently high frequency (> 5 kHz) that it could be filtered out.
Amplification by 100 000x was obtained from each pair of wires using a Neurolog System
(Digitimer Research Instrumentation) and frequencies <1 kHz and >5 kHz were attenuated by
filters. Two Quest Scientific ‘Hum Bug’ digital filters (Digitimer) were used to eliminate 50 Hz
noise. The differential activity from the two pairs of wires was finally digitised by the CED
1401+ data acquisition system using the associated Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic
Design, Cambridge, UK). Waveforms of putative action potentials were sampled at 20 kHz.
Behavioural events were communicated from the MED-PC to the CED 1401+’s digital inputs for
time-stamping. The temporal resolution of the MED-PC system was 2 msec.

2.4. Procedures
Rats were trained over a ~2 month period to reach the final stage of occasion setting
training (see Figure 1) according to the stages described below. The initial training stages were
adopted from a previous study (Wilson and Bowman, 2006). The later stages of training were
modified from a previously published protocol (Holland, 1995). In this experiment, transfer of
occasion setting properties was not examined as in the Holland paper.

Stage 1: Reward magazine training
Rats were trained in one 30- min session to lick the reward spigot to obtain saccharin
solution. Rats were only able to gain access to saccharine reinforcement at a variable interval
time schedule in which the first lick after 2, 4, 8 or 16 s (pseudorandomly chosen on each trial)
was reinforced. A lick made after one of the four variable time schedules was simultaneously
followed after 2 msec by the presentation of a conditioned stimulus, the onset of the reward
magazine light (RL). This was followed by the delivery of 0.05 mL (0.05 mL ⁄ s) of sodium
saccharin solution (0.25% w ⁄ v) whilst the RL was continuously presented.

Stage 2: Modified FR1 training
Rats were then introduced to bar pressing for reward delivery on a modified FR1 (fixedratio responding) schedule of lever pressing for 60 minutes. Reward delivery occurred as in the
previous stage (including that the RL continued to signal reward), except for two changes to a
standard FR1. First, rats were able to gain access to reward by licking on a variable interval time
schedule of 32s and 64s (randomly chosen on each trial), to keep the rats active and exploring.
Second, a lever was protruded for the entire 60 minutes, and each bar press was followed by the
delivery of sodium saccharin solution. Thus, rats were able to gain reward either through licking
during the variable time schedule or by bar pressing (at any time). Rats that completed 50 trials
by either bar pressing or licking (16 out of 16 rats) moved on to the next stage of training.

available under aCC-BY-NC 4.0 International license.

Stage 3: Standard FR1 training
Reward delivery did not occur by licking of the reward spigot as in stages 1 and 2. Rats
were only rewarded when bar pressing for reward on a FR1 schedule (1 bar press=reward
delivery) over 60 minutes. An arbitrary maximum of 50 reinforced bar presses in one session
was introduced, after which the rats were advanced to the next stage of training. Rats that did not
achieve 50 responses (2 out of 16 rats) were given further sessions until they reached the
criterion.

Stage 4: Discriminative stimulus training
The next stage was designed to place lever pressing under the control of a DS. This stage
was conducted over the next ~7 sessions. The rats were split pseudorandomly into two groups,
either being presented with a tone or houselight as a DS indicating to the rat the active
contingency between bar-pressing and reinforcement. Each session lasted 60 minutes, with 30s
blocks with DS on (indicating bar-pressing would lead to reinforcement) pseudorandomly
interleaved with 30s blocks with the DS off (indicating bar-pressing would not be reinforced).
Rats were hence only rewarded when bar pressing under the 30s continuous presentation of the
DS.
Bar presses under DS presentation versus no DS were recorded as the discrimination
index (bar presses under DS/( bar presses under DS + bar presses under no DS)). Rats (16 out of
16) that achieved > 80% discrimination index were advanced to the next stage.

Stage 5: Occasion setting training
The final stage of training was conducted over the next 11 sessions. There were four
types of trials in each 60-min session. Only one type of trial allowed the rat access to the sodium
saccharin solution. The four types of trials consisted of the following and were presented
pseudorandomly (see Figure 1): (1) the DS for 30s with no reinforcement of bar pressing; (2) the

OS for 30s with no reinforcement of bar pressing; (3) neither the OS nor the DS for 30s with no
reinforcement of bar pressing; and (4) the OS for 10s followed by OS+DS for 30s during which
time bar pressing was reinforced. The choice of a long interval between the OS and DS (and
hence reward opportunity) was motivated by previous research which demonstrated that longer
intervals between stimuli (and different sensory modalities; e.g. auditory and visual) favour the
acquisition of occasion setting (Fraser and Holland, 2019).

2.5. Surgery
Following behavioural training, rats underwent surgery to implant an electrode array that
was affixed onto the skull. Rats were anaesthetized using mixture of Isoflurane (5% for
induction, 2% for maintenance) and oxygen (1.0 L ⁄ min). A presurgical nonsteroidal, nonopiate
analgesic Rimadyl™ (0.5 mL ⁄ kg; 5% w⁄v carpofen; Pfizer Ltd, Kent, UK) was injected
subcutaneously. In order to lower the electrode array into place, a hole was drilled stereotaxically
at the top of the ventral tegmental area (VTA; 5.80 mm posterior and 0.8 mm lateral to bregma;
7.4–8.4 mm ventral to skull surface).
In addition, five to seven holes were drilled around the area to which the electrode array
would be attached, tapped for retaining screws (0–80 hex head, cup point set screws, 1 ⁄ 4 inch;
Small Parts Inc.). Using the stereotaxic arm, the electrode array was lowered and dental acrylic
used to secure the array to the cranium.

2.6. Histology
The following procedure is based upon previous work (Wilson and Bowman, 2006).
Rats underwent ~3 weeks of neurophysiological recording, and were killed by an overdose of 0.8
mL Dolethal TM (200 mg ⁄ L pentobarbitone sodium BP; Univet Ltd, Oxford, UK). Following
death, they were perfused intracardially with 0.1% phosphate-buffered saline, plus a fixative (4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer).

A freezing microtome was used to cut sections 50 µm thick. These sections were then
collected in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, and every fourth was stained for tyrosine hydroxylase and
Nissl bodies using standard protocols. In order to conform the position of the electrode
microwires with reference to the VTA, all stained sections were analysed under a light
microscope and mapped onto standardized sections of the brain (Paxinos and Watson, 2006). A
reconstruction of the position of the electrodes is shown in Figure 1B.

2.7. Data analysis
To identify responses in the population of putative DA neurons, we compared firing rates
across different trial types and time points (Figures 3 and 4). After aligning the activity of each
unit to the respective task event (e.g. OS, DS, or bar press), we determined the mean activity of
each unit. These mean firing rates were then obtained at different time points around the event of
interest, ranging from -5s to +5s relative to the event using 200ms wide window moving in steps
of 50ms. At each time point the distributions of firing rates were then statistically compared
across conditions using a two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (signrank.m function in Matlab).
To correct for multiple testing, we applied a p-value threshold that yielded a false discovery rate
of 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).
To visualize the mean firing rate of all individual units (Figures 2 and 3) we normalized
their activity to a range between 0 and 1 by first subtracting their minimal firing rate and then
dividing by the maximal firing rate of the result. The minimal firing rate was obtained within the
10s time window around the shown event.
For plotting, the individual and the population mean firing rates were smoothed using a
500ms wide Gaussian window with a standard deviation of 100ms. Statistical tests were
performed on the firing rates before smoothing. For the visualization of the mean absolute values
of the z-score of the firing rates (Figures 3 and 4), the session-wide mean and standard deviation

of the firing rate of each unit was determined in 1s time windows and then used to calculate the
z-score.
For the permutation analysis in Figures 3G and 4G we aimed to determine the
distribution of rate changes, which occur randomly. To do this we calculated rate changes at
random time points relative to the event of interest. Each time point was drawn from a uniform
distribution covering 9s before to 9s after the event. For a given permutation a time point was
drawn for each unit individually. The rate change was then calculated as the mean of the firing
rate across the 1s time window after each time point minus the mean firing rate across the 1s
time window preceding time point. For each iteration this procedure yielded a distribution of rate
changes, with one value for each unit. We then summed up the absolute values of these rate
changes and repeated this procedure 10,000 times for each trial type and stimulus alignment of
interest (i.e. DS in OS→DS trials, OS in OS→DS trials, OS in OS trials, DS in DS trials, and 10s
after the OS in OS trials). This approximated a distribution of absolute rate changes that are
expected just by chance. We then compared the actual absolute rate changes (shown in Figures
3G and 4G) with the corresponding distribution obtained from the permutation procedure. At
each time point this yielded a p-value, given by the fraction of permutated rate changes that were
equal or larger than the empirical ones. Here we used a simple Bonferroni correction based on
five different trial types / stimuli and ten independent 1s time windows for the rate change
calculation, yielding a p-value threshold for significance of 0.001.

2.8. Neurophysiology
Spike sorting
Spikes were firstly sorted online in Spike 2 ™ version 6 (Cambridge Electronic Design,
Cambridge, UK) using the waveform shape template matching, and re-sorted offline by
performing principal components analysis to visualise waveform clusters. The first three

principal components of each spike were assigned a co-ordinate in 3-D space, to be able to
cluster similar waveforms together. Separate clusters were then classified using the Normal
Mixtures algorithm in Spike2 (modified to include waveforms 2.5-3 standard deviations of the
centroid of that cluster as indicated by the best discrimination among clusters as judged by visual
inspection). Finally, overlaid waveforms were visually inspected to reject any putative spike that
seemed to be the result of a mechanical or electrical noise. The quality of the clustering was
assessed by calculating the signal-to-noise ratio within each cluster. Single neurons were
classified using the following criteria: there were no signs of noise at 50 Hz or its harmonics, the
inter-spike interval histogram exhibited a refractory period, and there were no electrical artefacts
within the cluster from the rat bar pressing or licking the spigot.

3. Results
3.1. Behaviour
The behavioural task consisted of four different trial types (Figure 1A). The first trial
type (“OS→DS”) started with the onset of the OS, followed after 10s by the onset of the DS.
Once the DS was presented, any bar press activated the reward magazine and delivered the
reward to the animal. Bar presses before the DS had no effect. The second trial type ("OS")
started in the same way, with the onset of the OS. However, there was no subsequent DS, and bar
presses had no effect. In the third trial type (“DS”) there was no OS, but instead it started
immediately with the DS, and bar presses were again not rewarded. Finally, some trials were
control trials ("none"), without any stimuli (i.e. no OS or DS) or rewards.
To see whether the behaviour of the animals reflected learning of the task, we determined
the number of bar presses per minute in the different trial types. We found that in OS→DS trials,
after the onset of the DS, the rate of bar presses was significantly higher compared to all other
trial types (p=2.4*10-5 for OS trials; p=2.8*10-7 for DS trials; p=4.1*10-20 for 'none' trials, onetailed 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests; Figure 2A). This indicated that the animals had
learned the overall task, and in particular that bar presses were only rewarded when the DS was
preceded by the OS. Furthermore, we analysed response times, i.e. the time it took the animals to
respond to the onset of a stimulus with a bar press. Learning would be reflected in fast response
times to the DS in OS→DS trials, compared to OS and DS control trials, respectively. Indeed,
we found that OS→DS trials had significantly faster response times (median=3.85s,
MAD=2.26s) than OS and DS trials (p=1.6*10-6 for OS trials, median 4.6s, MAD=3.0s;
p=2.5*10-7 for DS trials, median=3.75s, MAD=2.3s, one-tailed 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov
tests; Figure 2B). Based on these results we conclude that the animals used the OS and DS to
guide their behaviour as intended by the task design.

3.2. Cell type classification
Neural activity was recorded in the VTA as verified by histological analysis of the
electrode tracks (Figure 1B), and then spike sorted based on the waveform. To determine
whether recorded units corresponded to putative DA neurons, we analysed the shape of the
average waveform of each recorded unit. Using the amplitude ratio and half width duration to
cluster the units (see Methods) yielded a distinct profile of putative DA (n=41) and non-DA
neurons (n=55; Figure 2C), similar to previous studies (Pan, Schmidt, Wickens, and Hyland,
2008; Roesch, Calu, and Schoenbaum, 2007).

3.3. Neural Responses to the Occasion Setter and Discriminating Stimulus
We investigated whether putative DA neurons distinguished the reward-predicting
properties of the OS and DS in the different trial types.
Firstly, we aligned the activity of each putative DA neuron to the onset of the OS, which
occurred in two trial types (OS→DS and OS). In OS→DS trials, 10s after the onset of the OS,
the DS was presented. In contrast, in OS trials, the DS never occurred. The onset of the OS did
not elicit a visible response in the mean firing rate of the population of putative DA neurons in
either trial type (Figure 3A). However, inspection of the individual unit firing rates (Figure 3, A1
and A2) indicated the presence of both increases and decreases as a response to the OS. We
visualized these apparent responses using the absolute value of the mean z-score as a measure of
activity changes, so that increases and decreases in firing rate would summate instead of
cancelling each other out (shown as white lines in Figure 3, A1 and A2). As the amplitude,
timing and duration of these responses varied considerably across units, we employed a more
elaborate analysis instead of attempting to count the number of units with significant increases
and decreases (see below). We conclude that despite the OS being a behavioural significant
event that the animals used to guide their behaviour, there was no population increase in putative

DA cell activity. However, individual neurons responded to the OS, potentially reflecting an
intermediate stage of learning, or a more local mode of DA signalling.
Secondly, we aligned activity of each putative DA neuron to the onset of the DS. Again,
this could be done for two trial types, OS→DS trials and DS trials (i.e. with no preceding OS).
For OS→DS trials there was a sharp response to the onset of the DS with a ~4Hz increase in the
mean firing rate of putative DA neurons (Figure 3B). This increase was significant compared to
the mean firing rate in DS trials (Figure 3B; two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, see Methods),
and compared to the activity 10s after the onset of the OS in OS trials ('no DS' in Figure 3B). The
response to the DS was also present in the subset of OS→DS trials, in which it took the animals
more than 5s to press the bar afterwards (Figure 3B). Therefore, the sharp increase in OS→DS
trials was not due to subsequent bar presses, but a response to the DS itself.
Examining the corresponding single-unit activity patterns revealed a strong response in
OS→DS trials in the majority of units (Figure 3, B1). While in DS trials there was no prominent
increase in the mean firing rate, individual neurons showed increases or decreases (Figure 3, B2),
very similar to the OS responses described above. This was supported by the corresponding
visualisation of the absolute value of the mean z-score, yielding a sharp increase at DS onset. As
a control we used again the 'no DS' trials and examined activity 10s after the onset of the OS, the
time when the DS would have occurred. Importantly, in this control there were no marked
increases or decreases in the firing rate of individual neurons (Figure 3, B3), also supported by
the absence of an increase in the absolute mean z-score. These results demonstrate that the
response to the DS can be flexibly modulated by the OS to either yield a population increase or a
population 'null' signal.
We then looked into more detail into the single unit responses to the OS and DS. Note
that also for simple baseline activity, random fluctuations would lead to a spurious response
pattern when the units are sorted based on their activity (Figure 3). Therefore, we devised
additional analyses to ensure that the observed single-unit increases and decreases exceed chance

level. First, for each unit, we determined the change in firing rate in the 1s time window
preceding the stimulus to the 1s time window following the stimulus. The resulting distribution
of firing rate changes (one value per unit) was then compared across the different stimuli and
trial types, using their cumulative distributions for visualisation (Figure 3F). For OS→DS trials,
there was a strong response in the majority of individual units (Figure 3, B1), which was
reflected in the cumulative distribution of the firing rate changes being shifted towards positive
values (Figure 3F). At the other extreme, our 'no DS' control condition (10s after the OS onset),
with no apparent single-unit responses (Figure 3, B3), yielded a more symmetrical and narrow
cumulative distribution of firing rate changes (Figure 3F). In contrast the responses to the OS (in
OS→DS and OS trials) and DS (in DS trials) were wider, reflecting the presence of units with
larger firing rate changes, both positive and negative ones. Next, we calculated the sum of all
absolute firing rate changes across all units in a given condition, obtaining a measure for
population rate changes that is sensitive to parallel increases and decreases in firing rate. This
measure was calculated at different time points relative to the onset of the cue (OS or DS). The
resulting modulations over time showed that there was a significant change in firing rate at the
onset of the OS and DS (permutation test, see Methods; Figure 3G). In contrast, for our 'no DS'
control, there was no such change. This verifies our assertion above that, despite the absence of
increases in mean firing rate, the OS (in OS→DS and OS trials) and DS (in DS trials) lead to
increases and decreases in the firing rate of individual DA neurons.

3.4. Bar pressing and reward responses
Next we analysed neural responses related to the bar pressing behaviour of the animals.
We examined activity related to bar presses in three trial types: OS→DS, DS, and OS trials. To
reduce the impact of variability across bar presses in terms of timing and reward predictions, we
focussed on the first bar press that the animals performed after the onset of the DS or OS.

We found that in OS→DS trials, putative DA neurons increased their firing rate around bar
presses, starting about 1s before the bar press, peaking at the time of the bar press, and lasting
until about 1s after the bar press (Figure 3C). Unrewarded bar presses in OS or DS trials had a
similar temporal profile preceding the bar press, but after the bar press, the firing rate dropped
quickly back to baseline, yielding significantly different firing rates up to 1s after the bar press
(Figure 3C). This might be due to the lack of reward feedback in the DS and OS trial types
compared to the OS→DS trials.
Although the animals typically released the bar quickly after the bar press, there was
some temporal variation between these events. Aligning activity to the bar release, yielded a
similar temporal profile in the firing rate increase across trial types (Figure 3D). As the bar
release immediately triggered the reward magazine light, it could be considered a key event in
the behavioural sequence leading to the reward. Seemingly, the temporal profile of the putative
DA neurons corresponded to a slow ramping increase in firing rate starting up to 5s before the
bar release (Figure 3D). As this ramping increase in firing rate was reminiscent of the increases
in striatal DA concentration occurring over seconds during goal approach (Howe, Tierney,
Sandberg, Phillips, and Graybiel, 2013) and reinforcement learning (Hamid, Pettibone, Mabrouk,
Hetrick, Schmidt, Vander Weele, Kennedy, Aragona, and Berke, 2016; Mohebi et al., 2019), we
examined it in further detail. Our results indicated the ramping firing rate in this case was due to
the averaging across trials with different event timings, rather than a slowly ramping, putative
motivational signal. This was supported by a control analysis on the subset of trials in which the
DS onset occurred within less than 2s before the bar release. In this control analysis the apparent
ramp occurred only within the 2s before the bar release (Figure 3D), supporting that the ramp is
merely due to preceding DS and bar press events (Figure 3B, C). Similarly, the activity, when
aligned to the onset of the reward, exhibited a ramp over seconds that basically matched the
distribution of preceding bar presses and DS onsets (Figure 3E). In contrast to the OS and DS

responses described above, the single-unit firing rates related to the bar press, bar release, and
reward were very homogeneous across the population of putative DA neurons (Figure 3, C1-E1).

We conclude that also in this operant paradigm, involving contextual OS cues and longer time
scales, DA cell firing rates exhibited brief firing rate increases to reward-predictive cues and
actions, but did not show ramping activity as presumed for motivational signals.

3.5. Comparison with non-DA neurons
We repeated all analyses of the firing rates in the different trial types for neurons that
were labelled as putative non-DA neurons (Figure 2C). Similar to the putative DA neurons, also
the non-DA units exhibited no clear response to the OS in the population mean firing rate (Figure
4A). However, also the inspection of the individual unit activity and the mean absolute z-score
(Figure 4, A1 and A2) did not suggest the existence of any responses on a single unit level.
In contrast to the DA analyses, the non-DA units did not show any population response to
the DS (Figure 4B). However, interestingly, on a single unit level DS responses were present,
which seemed to cancel out in the population average. For the OS→DS trials these responses
occurred mostly within 3s after the DS, while in DS trials the responses seemed to occur only
within less than a second after the DS (Figure 4, B1 and B2). The responses to the bar press and
release had a similar time course as the DA units, but showed no significant differences between
the trial types (Figure 4C, D). This seemed to be mostly due to overall briefer responses, which
were also visible on a single unit level (Figure 4, C1 and D2). Finally the reward responses
exhibited a similar profile as the DA units, but the non-DA units decreased their activity briefly
before the reward onset (Figure 4E, E1), while the DA units decrease occurred a bit later.
For the analysis of the firing rate changes from -1s to +1s around the stimulus, the
cumulative distributions of the rate changes strongly overlapped across the different conditions
(Figure 4F). However, the statistical analyses of the rate changes revealed a significant rate

change around the time of the DS in both OS→DS and DS trials (Figure 4G). In contrast, rate
changes in OS→DS and OS trials did not show pronounced increases at OS onset, indicating that
they did not elicit any or only weak/short responses to the OS.
We conclude that putative non-DA neurons did not show population level responses to
reward-predicting stimuli in the OS paradigm. However, on a single-unit level they did show
both increases and decreases to the DS, which cancelled out on a population level. The absence
of OS responses in putative non-DA neurons suggests that the single-unit responses to the OS in
putative DA neurons originate from external inputs rather than from other VTA neurons.

4. Discussion
Our results showed that putative DA neurons encoded the relationship between the OS
and the DS. Responses of putative DA cells to the DS were enhanced when preceded by the OS,
as were behavioural responses to obtain rewards. This is consistent with the hypothesis that
responses of DA neurons to the DS contribute to the expression of behavioural responses.
Surprisingly though, we did not find a population response of putative DA neurons to the OS,
contrary to predictions of standard temporal-difference models of DA neurons. As the OS was
the earliest predictor of reward in the task sequence of events, standard temporal-difference
models would predict at least a partial shift of the DA response from the reward to the OS (Pan
et al., 2005; Schultz et al., 1997). Intriguingly, despite the absence of a population response, our
recorded putative DA neurons exhibited a heterogeneous response on a single unit level, so that
some units increased and others decreased their activity as a response to the OS. Similarly,
putative non-DA cells did not respond to the DS on a population level, but with heterogeneous
responses on a single unit level.
DA cell responses have not been studied so far in tasks with OSs. Our behavioural task
closely followed the pivotal studies that introduced serial feature positive discrimination (Looney

and Griffin, 1978; Ross and Holland, 1981; Sainsbury and Jenkins, 1967). In their procedure the
OS is presented before the DS, which is then followed by a behavioural response leading to
reward. However, when the DS was presented on its own, the response is not rewarded. The
behavioural analysis in these classic studies revealed that conditioned responding to the OS was
minimal compared to the DS when preceded by the OS. This demonstrated that the OS, rather
than creating a simple associative link with reward, modulated the response determined by the
DS. Our task and behavioural data matched these findings, permitting us to address the
underlying neural processes involved DA signalling.
Our neurophysiological data indicated that midbrain DA cells might act as
neurobiological substrate for encoding occasion setting properties, perhaps in coordination with
neurons in the OFC (Shobe, Bakhurin, Claar, and Masmanidis, 2017). Furthermore, our results
pointed to a limitation of standard temporal-difference models to account for DA cell responses
to reward predicting stimuli, and support models that employ a more complex state
representation (Daw, Courville, and Touretzky, 2006). There are several possibilities for the lack
of neural responses to the OS at a population level. Firstly, in our task there was a long time
delay between the OS and the reward. In classical conditioning DA cells of primates reduce their
responses to the conditioned stimulus hyperbolically as a function of the interval between the
conditioned and unconditioned stimulus (Kobayashi and Schultz, 2008). However, albeit in that
study DA responses were reduced for long intervals, DA neurons still fired to conditioned
stimuli that were 16s away from the reward, which would be within the time range of the OSreward interval in our paradigm. Another difference was that in Kobayashi and Schultz (2008)
DA neurons increased their firing rate following reward presentation, a pattern that we did not
observe in our data. Instead during the presentation and consumption of the reward, our putative
DA cell activity decreased (Kiyatkin and Gratton, 1994; Nishino, Ono, Muramoto, Fukuda, and
Sasaki, 1987; Richardson and Gratton, 1996). Secondly, the lack of the population response to
the OS could be due to the low contingency between the OS and the reward. The OS predicted

the reward with only 50% probability, and was necessary but not sufficient for reinforcement.
Responses of DA neurons to conditioned stimuli encode reward probability, with stronger
responses for higher reward probabilities (Fiorillo et al., 2003). However, this would only
explain a weak response to the OS, rather than the absence of a population response. Thirdly,
although DA neurons did not respond to the OS at a population level, they did respond with
increased and decreased firing in the activity of single units. This suggests that context, here in
the form of the OS stimulus, may be encoded by DA neurons at a single-cell level. Although this
contrasts with the idea of DA cells providing a global signal to the striatum, this type of
signalling may be relevant for more localized changes in striatal DA concentration. To determine
this future studies could examine whether such heterogeneity in the DA cell responses (Fiorillo,
Yun, and Song, 2013) is reflected in different anatomical subgroups and projection targets,
which we could not assess in the present data.
DA cell activity is often characterized by brief phasic increases. While slow, ramp-like
increases in DA concentration have been found in the striatum (Hamid et al., 2016; Howe et al.,
2013), corresponding slow increases in the firing rate of DA neurons have not been found
(Mohebi et al., 2019). One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that DA cell firing has
typically been studied in simple behavioural tasks such as classical conditioning (Pan et al.,
2005), while striatal DA concentration has also been measured in more complex tasks (Hamid et
al., 2016), involving longer time scales for approaching a goal (Howe et al., 2013). In the present
study longer timescales (10s of seconds) were required for the animal to integrate information
about the OS and DS, and the reward contingencies were more complex than in a classical
conditioning paradigm. Still, our analyses on the firing rates suggested that DA cell responses
consisted mostly of phasic changes in relation to the OS, DS, and bar pressing. Therefore, we
conclude that also in this more complex task involving longer time scales, DA cell firing showed
no evidence for ramp-like increases in firing rate that might correspond to a motivational signal.

In summary, DA neurons incorporated context in their responses to reward-predicting
stimuli and exhibited complex responses to OS stimuli that point to heterogeneous rather than
global DA signals.

Figure 1. A. Top. Thirsty rats (n=16) were reinforced with saccharin solution for bar pressing only during OS (tone
or light, counterbalanced) overlapping with a subsequent discriminative stimulus (DS, light or tone,
counterbalanced) (i.e. between 10 seconds and 40 seconds of the trial). No reward was delivered if the animal bar
pressed in the first 10 seconds of the trial (i.e. when only the OS was present). The rats could earn multiple
reinforcers during periods in which OS and the DS were presented together. In all other trial types, bar pressing
during OS alone (2nd from the top), DS alone (2nd from the bottom), or during no stimuli being presented (bottom),
was not rewarded. B. Diagrammatic illustration of electrode tract position for the six rats during which putative

time was longer than 5s, i.e. the DS onset and first bar press are separated by more than 5s. The 'No DS' trials were
the same as OS trials, but here we aligned activity to the time point when the DS would have been presented if this
were an OS→DS trial. (B1-B3) Corresponding activity of each individual putative DA neuron is shown for OS→DS
(B1), DS (B2), and 'no DS' control (B3) trials (same visualisations as in A1 and A2). (C) Mean firing rate of the
