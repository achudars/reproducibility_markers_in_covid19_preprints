Abstract

12

1.

Remote detectors are being used increasingly often to study aquatic and aerial species,

13

for which movement is significantly different from terrestrial species. While terrestrial camera-trapping

14

studies have shown that capture frequency, along with the species’ movement speed and detector

15

specifications can be used to estimate absolute densities, the approach has not yet been adapted to

16

cases where movement occurs in three dimensions. Frameworks based on animal movement patterns

17

allow estimating population density from camera-trapping data when animals are not individually

18

distinguishable.

19

2.

Here we adapt one such framework to three-dimensional movement to characterize the

20

relationship between population density, animal speed, characteristics of a remote sensor’s detection

21

zone, and detection frequency. The derivation involves defining the detection zone mathematically and

22

calculating the mean area of the profile it presents to approaching individuals.

23

3.

We developed two variants of the model – one assuming random movement of all

24

individuals, and one allowing for different probabilities for each approach direction (e.g. that animals

25

more often swim/fly horizontally than vertically). We used computer simulations to evaluate model

26

performance for a wide range of animal and detector densities. Simulations show that in ideal

27

conditions the method approximates true density well, and that estimates become increasingly accurate

28

using more detectors, or sampling for longer. Moreover, the method is robust to invalidation of

29

assumptions, accuracy is decreased only in extreme cases where all detectors are facing the same way.

30

4.

We provide equations for estimating population density from detection frequency and

31

outline how to estimate the necessary parameters. We discuss how environmental variables and

32

species-specific characteristics affect parameter estimates and how to account for these differences in

33

density estimations.

Our method can be applied to common remote detection methods (cameras and

35

acoustic detectors), which are currently being used to study a diversity of species and environments.

Therefore, our work may significantly expand the number and diversity of species for which density can

Introduction

43

Remote detection methods like camera-traps originated for studying surface-dwelling species

44

but are increasingly being used to study aquatic, arboreal, and airborne species. These technologies

45

require considerably less effort and resources than alternatives like transects, particularly for long-term

46

studies, and are less invasive. In aquatic studies, remote underwater video has allowed more efficient,

47

extensive, and less biased sampling than diver-based surveys (King, George, Buckle, Novak, & Fulton,

48

2018; Mallet & Pelletier, 2014). Similarly, acoustic detectors are becoming a more accessible and

49

popular tool for studying and monitoring a variety of taxa such as birds (Blumstein et al., 2011; Celis-

50

Murillo, Deppe, & Allen, 2009), echolocating bats (Marques et al., 2013), and even fishes that produce

51

species-specific sounds, especially with the aid of automatic identification algorithms (Lindseth, Lobel,

52

Lindseth, & Lobel, 2018). Camera-traps in turn have been useful to study the demographics of elusive

53

species or to learn about biodiversity across different spatial scales (Ahumada et al., 2011; Barea-Azcón,

54

Virgós, Ballesteros-Duperón, Moleón, & Chirosa, 2007; Karanth, Nichols, Kumar, & Hines, 2006). In

55

every case, the technologies, software and analysis methods are constantly evolving (Burton 2015).

56

Two decades of theoretical developments have created a vast literature of methods for

57

estimating the density of wild populations from camera-trapping data, and some of these methods can

58

be adapted to other types of detectors. Mark-recapture methods, for example, have been used to study

59

aquatic species with individually recognizable spots like whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) and eagle rays

60

(Myliobatidae) (González-Ramos, Santos-Moreno, Rosas-Alquicira, & Fuentes-Mascorro, 2017; Meekan

61

et al., 2006). However, most species lack individual markings and are therefore not amenable to these

62

approaches (e.g., Karanth et al. 2006). For these species, existing frameworks for estimating density

63

either provide relative estimates only [e.g. detection frequency, minimum number of detected

64

individuals (Sherman, Chin, Heupel, & Simpfendorfer, 2018), maximum number of conspecifics in a

65

single frame (Willis, Millar, & Babcock, 2000)], or make assumptions about how animals move for

66

estimating absolute density [e.g. movement around a home range centre (Campos-Candela, Palmer,

67

Balle, & Alós, 2018), random walks (Nakashima, Fukasawa, & Samejima, 2018), ideal gas movement

68

(Rowcliffe, Field, Turvey, & Carbone, 2008)]. These movement-based frameworks need to be adapted

69

for key differences between terrestrial and aquatic or aerial species that perceive the world and move in

70

three dimensions.

71

One approach for estimating population density when individuals cannot be distinguished is the

72

Random Encounter Model (REM), formalized for encounters between animals and camera-traps by

73

Rowcliffe et al. (2008). The model assumes that animals move like ideal gases (in straight lines, in

74

random directions, with constant speed) and as a result the frequency at which a species is

75

photographed by camera-traps (henceforth, “detection frequency”) scales positively with the number of

76

individuals present in an area (i.e. population density), the species’ mean speed, and the size of the

77

camera’s detection zone. This relationship can therefore be used to estimate density from the detection

78

frequency. While this method requires more information about a study species than relative abundance

79

measures, it considerably expands the number of species for which density can be estimated using

80

camera-traps. The REM framework can be adapted to species that move in three dimensions rather than

81

two, considering the three-dimensional shape and size of the detection zone.

82

Here, we present such an adaptation to estimate absolute density for aquatic species, using

83

underwater cameras, and for birds and echolocating species, using acoustic sensors. Our adaptation

84

substantially expands possibilities for estimating density from remote detection methods when species

85

can be identified but individuals cannot. This method only requires the detection frequency of a species,

86

information about the sensor’s detection zone, and an estimate of the species’ speed. We provide two

87

alternatives; the first assumes completely random movement (within the specifications of the ideal gas

88

framework, cf. below), while the second allows accounting for biases in movement direction (e.g. that

89

fish more often swim parallel, rather than perpendicular, to the bottom). First, we will explain the

detection zone. We will then develop the formulae for density for two types of detectors and test our

92

estimator’s performance using computer simulations.

Materials and Methods

Model Derivation
1.1. The Random Encounter Model framework

The REM method for estimating density of unmarked animals from camera-trapping data is

97

based on the idea that the encounter rate between a stationary detector and animals of a given species

98

scales linearly with the species’ density (see Hutchinson & Waser, 2007), with a scaling factor that

99

depends on the species’ movement characteristics and the detector’s ability to record animals that are

100

111

passing by at various distances (Rowcliffe et al., 2008). This relationship is summarized as:

𝐷=

𝑓
𝑝̂ 𝑣̅

(1)

101

where D is animal density, f is detection frequency, and v̄ is mean animal movement speed (See Table 1

102

for description of parameters). The scaling constant 𝑝̂ can be thought of as the mean distance (in 2D) or

103

area (in 3D) sampled instantaneously by the detector over all possible directions, and therefore depends

104

on the sensor’s technical specifications (opening angles and maximum detection distance) and on

105

environmental variables (e.g. water clarity, foliage or clutter). Here, we will derive an equation for 𝑝̂ for

106

the three-dimensional case. The main steps are 1) determining the shape of the detection zone, 2)

107

describing it mathematically, and 3) calculating the mean area of its two-dimensional projection. The

108

result is used directly in equation 1 to estimate density from capture frequency. We explain in more

109

detail the projection of the detection zone in Section 2 and derive the density estimator in Section 3. We

110

then test the performance of our estimator with computer-simulated capture data.

1.2. Profile of the detection zone, extension from 2D to 3D
For terrestrial camera-traps, where animals move in two dimensions only, 𝑝̂ in equation 1 is the

117

mean profile width of the camera’s detection zone, as presented to approaching animals. Given the

118

shape of the detection zone, the profile width depends on the direction of approach (Fig. 1). While not

119

explicitly stated by Rowcliffe et al. (2008), the “profile” is the projection of the detection zone onto a

120

line perpendicular to the direction of approach. One can therefore use Cauchy’s surface area theorem

121

(Cauchy, 1841) to calculate the mean profile width. This theorem states that the average projected area

122

of a convex body is proportional to its surface area. The mean profile width of the two-dimensional

123

detection zone is its perimeter P multiplied by a constant:

which is the same as equation 2 in Rowcliffe et al. (2008). The theorem can readily be applied to

126

determine the mean profile of a three-dimensional detection zone.

In the case of a three-dimensional detection zone, equation (1) still holds, with the difference

that 𝑝̂ corresponds to an area instead of a length. This area is nonetheless the projection of the

detection zone onto a lower-dimensional object, i.e. onto a plane. According to Cauchy’s theorem, the

140

cropped image (i.e. cameras). For acoustic detectors we also determined how to calculate density when

there is bias in directions of approach relative to the direction of the detector, for example bats flying

142

most frequently horizontally into a detection zone facing up.

2.

Definition of the detection zone

145

A remote detector’s detection zone is generally determined by two parameters: detection angle

146

and maximum distance from which a signal is detectable. Geometrically, this translates into a cone with

147

a convex base. Acoustic detectors report signals no matter where in this zone they occur, but for

148

cameras some near-boundary signals are lost when images are cropped to a rectangular frame. As such,

149

acoustic detectors have the full “conical-with-hat-shaped” detection zone (Fig. 2A), whereas cameras

150

have a subset of this region defined by the horizontal and vertical angles of view (Fig. 2D). In Section 3.1,

151

we derive expressions to calculate the surface area for both detector types and use Cauchy’s theorem to

152

calculate the respective mean profile area. This method applies if we assume that all directions of

153

approach are equally likely. In section 3.2, we relax this assumption and consider potential biases in the

154

direction of approach.

159

the area 𝑺𝑪 of a spherical cap (C); for cameras, we considered the surface area 𝑺𝑳 of four disc segments (E) and

2.1. Uniformly distributed approach directions
To calculate the surface area of an acoustic sensor’s detection zone, we divide the detection

166

zone into two components: a conic base (Fig. 2B) and a spherical cap (Fig. 2C). The lateral surface area of

167

the cone is calculated from the slant height, s (i.e. the maximum detection distance), and the cone’s

basal radius, b, as:

Cauchy’s theorem is only valid for convex bodies, so equation 6 only applies when the detection

angle is smaller than π (180°) or equal to 2π (360°). The latter occurs when signals can be detected from

179

any direction, as is the case with omnidirectional microphones. Consider for example an acoustic

detector with a detection angle of 90° (π/2 rad) that can detect signals from 10 meters away.

disc sectors are given by 𝑆𝜈 = 𝜋𝑠 2 2𝜋 or 𝑆𝜇 = 𝜋𝑠 2 2𝜋, respectively, the total lateral surface area of the

Furthermore, the surface area of the spherical rectangle cap, SR (Fig. 1F), is obtained by multiplying the

surface area of a sphere of radius s by the proportion of the sphere occupied by the spherical rectangle:

2.2. Bias in direction of movement

209

The method described above for calculating the detection zone’s mean profile area 𝑝̂ assumes

210

that every direction of approach is equally likely. However, some angles of approach could occur more

211

frequently than others depending both on the study species and the placement and orientation of the

212

detector. Picture, for example, fish moving in a stream in the direction of the current. The profile

213

presented to all of them by a camera is the same and the effective mean profile area is greater or lower

214

than the expected mean profile area, depending on which way the detector is facing. To account for

215

these biases, we derive formulae to calculate the detection zone’s projected area 𝑝 for any direction of

216

approach and then weight these according to the probability of approach directions. As these

217

calculations quickly become lengthy and complicated, we here summarize the approach for acoustic

218

detectors and provide detailed calculations in Appendix A4.

The mean profile area is given by:

𝑝̂ =

221

where P(ω) is the probability that an individual approaches the detector at angle ω, and p(ω) gives the

222

profile area corresponding to that direction. Depending on ω – the angle relative to the direction of the

Simulation tests

We tested the formula for estimating density from detection frequency using computer

238

simulations. Firstly, these serve to confirm that the method performs well under ideal conditions (i.e.

239

when all model assumptions are met and perfect information about the species’ movement is available)

240

and secondly to test the robustness to invalidation of assumptions. The assumptions regarding animal

241

movement are those of the ideal gas model: individuals moving in a straight line, in random directions,

242

and at a constant speed. We assumed perfect detection and an exact knowledge of the detection

243

distance and opening angle and evaluated the method’s performance for a range of animal densities

244

and detector numbers. Furthermore, to determine the robustness of our method, we evaluated its

245

performance for the following scenarios: (i) allowing variation in speed by randomly selecting different

246

individual speeds; (ii) allowing a non-random distribution of approach directions by randomly selecting

247

individual ‘tilt’ angles, combined with realistic scenarios of detector placement and orientation.

248

We set up the simulation as follows: Individuals were distributed at random locations within a

249

cube of side 10, and each one was assigned a random direction (x, y, z vector components drawn from a

250

uniform distribution from -1 to 1). All individuals moved at the same speed and bounced back into the

251

cube if they reached the reflective boundaries. We tested the density estimator for a range of densities

252

between 0.1 and 10 ind.uv-1 (individuals per unit volume), i.e. between 100 and 10000 individuals.

253

We placed between 5 and 25 detectors facing in random directions at random locations within

254

the ‘sampling zone’, a cube of side 4 situated at the centre of the larger cube. We set a detection

255

distance of 0.5 ud (unit distance) and a detection angle of 45°, which yields a mean profile area of 0.105

256

ua (unit area) (equation 6).

257
258

We set movement speed equal to one length of the detection radius per time step and ran each
simulation for 40 steps. We counted an encounter whenever an individual entered a detection zone.

259

Thus, we obtained for each step and each detector the total number of detections up to that time point.

260

We calculated the detection frequency f by dividing this cumulative count by the number of steps and

261

then divided f by the mean profile area and the movement speed to estimate density (eq. 1). We

262

recorded the mean estimated density across all detectors at every time step. We also determined how

263

performance changed with effort both in terms of the number of detectors and sampling time.

264

To test how variability in speed among individuals affected density estimates, we ran

265

simulations assigning each individual a speed drawn at random from a normal distribution with mean

266

0.5 ud/step, and with standard deviation between 0 and 0.1 ud/step. Similarly, to determine the effect

267

of having biased movement directions, we drew the vertical (z) component of the individual direction

268

vectors from a truncated normal distribution centred around 0 and bounded between -1 and 1, so that

269

most individuals would move near horizontally. We assessed the effect of this bias on the performance

270

of the estimator for several scenarios of detector distribution (regular spacing of detectors in 2D on a

271

plane, regular spacing in 3D throughout the sampling cube, random distribution in 3D) and orientation

272

(all horizontal, all vertical, random). These simulations were run with ten detectors.

273

We iterated each scenario 100 times, and assessed model performance by calculating the bias,

274

precision and accuracy of the density estimate relative to the real density at the end of each simulation.

275

We used the scaled mean error (SME), the coefficient of variation (CV) and the scaled mean square error

276

(SMSE) as indicators of bias, precision, and accuracy, respectively:

Results

288

Simulations show that, under ideal conditions, the estimated density closely approximates the

289

real density. Regardless of the number of detectors used, the estimate density was within 5% of the real

290

value at the end of each simulation (Fig. 4A), and the standard deviation was no larger than 30% of the

291

mean estimate (Fig. 4B). The overall performance of the method nonetheless depended on sampling

292

effort, both in terms of the number of detectors and the sampling time. The lowest number of detectors

293

yielded the greatest bias and the lowest precision and accuracy, and all indices improved substantially

294

with the deployment of additional detectors (Fig. 4A-C). Moreover, bias also decreases, and precision

295

and accuracy increase, as sampling time increases (Fig. 4D-F), meaning that in real-life applications a low

296

availability of detectors could at least be partially compensated for by longer sampling times.

distributed regularly or randomly across the 3D space yielded similar accuracy and precision estimates

for all cases of movement direction bias. Nevertheless, there was virtually equal performance regardless

of detector placement when detectors faced in random directions (Fig. 6F, I). Moreover, the random

Discussion

335

We have outlined a method to use remote detectors such as underwater cameras or acoustic

336

sensors to estimate population density from an encounter rate. The underlying random encounter

337

model was originally proposed and tested as a density estimator for species moving in a two-

338

dimensional terrestrial environment by Rowcliffe et al. (2008), and our calculations now allow its

339

adaptation to species that move in three dimensions such as fishes, birds and bats. The basic

340

requirements regarding detector specifications and information on movement speed remain the same

341

as for the two-dimensional case.

342

Simulations show good performance of the estimator, low levels of bias, and a high degree of

343

precision. Such consistent performance was expected when all assumptions were met, which may not

344

be the case in real-life applications. We showed, however, that the method is robust to violations of

345

assumptions. There was very little effect of increased variance in speed among individuals, or of bias in

346

direction. Furthermore, our simulation results suggest that any effect could be limited or altogether

347

eliminated simply by orienting detectors in different directions, even when detectors are placed on a

348

single plane (on the ground, for example).

349
350

Performance is significantly influenced by sampling effort as it relates to the real density, in
terms of both time and number of detectors. At low densities especially, insufficient effort could result

351

in an over- or underestimation of density. An advantage of using a method based on movement models

352

is that researchers can use the same framework to calculate the effort needed beforehand. Rearranging

353

eq. 1 and substituting density and speed with prior information allows calculating an expected capture

354

frequency. We saw no bias at higher densities, but we expect that in practice extremely high densities

355

(e.g. in fish schools) may prevent properly counting individuals, resulting in underestimated densities. In

356

these cases, researchers could first estimate a density of groups and obtain overall density by

357

multiplying this estimate by an independently calculated mean group size (Rowcliffe et al. 2008).

358

Our method can be applied in cases where a lack of individual markings impedes the use of

359

mark-recapture techniques. It is also an improvement over indices of relative abundance such as the

360

maximum or mean number of conspecifics in a single frame (Schobernd, Bacheler, & Conn, 2014;

361

Sherman et al., 2018). These metrics are commonly used to analyse footage from baited-remote-

362

underwater-video-stations (BRUVS), but can underestimate true abundance (Cappo, Harvey, Malcolm, &

363

Speare, 2003; Stobart et al., 2015). We know of no similar tools to estimate abundance from acoustic

364

detectors. These sensors allow to identify species and count passages through the detection zone, so

365

our method is also applicable with these technologies, provided the detection zone and mean species

366

speed can be accurately measured.

367

For many species, mean speed will not be immediately available in the literature but could be

368

approximated with additional measurements. For example, using two cameras in a stereo arrangement,

369

the footage from both could be used to estimate speed (Somerton, Williams, & Campbell, 2017;

370

Williams, Rooper, & Towler, 2010) and – using only one of the two cameras – population density in the

371

same study.. Movement If detectors are deployed for several days the estimation of mean speed must

372

include periods of inactivity (see Carbone, Cowlishaw, Isaac, & Rowcliffe, 2005). Ideally, surveys should

373

be conducted at the same time of day when working in different sites, during the species’ daily activity

374

peak.

375

Additional to speed, an exact characterization of the detection zone is required to estimate

376

density accurately. This zone is determined first by the opening angle (for acoustic detectors), or the

377

horizontal and vertical fields of vision (for cameras), usually given by the manufacturer. However, action

378

cameras commonly used in remote underwater surveys have wide-angle lenses, which distort the

379

image. Because of this, the diagonal field of vision will not correspond to the angle calculated assuming

380

a rectilinear lens (see Appendix A3). The additional area in the projection due to the distortion should be

381

small, so we suggest assuming a rectilinear lens for consistency.

382

The second element needed to characterize the detection zone is the detection radius. Unlike

383

the opening angles the detection radius is influenced by environmental variables. For example, for

384

underwater cameras, detection distance depends on visibility (i.e. turbidity), which should be

385

considered when comparing densities across sites. Similarly, for acoustic detectors, atmospheric

386

conditions like temperature and humidity affect how far an acoustic signal travels, effectively influencing

387

the detection distance for birds and bats (Lawrence & Simmons, 1982; Snell-Rood, 2012). In both

388

aquatic and aerial surveys, physical obstacles such as vegetation will also limit detectability; for instance,

389

detection of bats with low-frequency calls (25 kHz) is significantly hindered by habitat structure

390

(Patriquin, Hogberg, Chruszcz, Barclay, & Barclay, 2003; Weller & Zabel, 2002).

391

Environmental variables also interact with species-specific traits, generating different detection

392

distances even under comparable environmental conditions. For example, cameras can detect larger

393

species further than smaller species, and acoustic detectors will detect species with lower frequency or

394

more intense calls at greater distances from than species with high-frequency calls (Jakobsen, Brinkløv,

395

& Surlykke, 2013; Lawrence & Simmons, 1982; Snell-Rood, 2012; Surlykke & Kalko, 2008). Given the

396

multiple factors that influence detection distance, we suggest an ad-hoc calculation for every system, for

397

example placing a model of the study species progressively further from a camera until it is no longer

398

recognizable. With acoustic detectors the same can be done using a speaker at a range of distances.

399

Our calculations are performed for individual detectors, but, as our simulations show, the best

400

results are obtained when averaging across multiple detectors. Improved performance using more

401

detectors is to be expected, as averaging across detectors minimizes possible sampling errors (Rowcliffe

402

et al., 2008). Using more detectors also reduced variability across trials, implying that less effort is

403

required to obtain accurate density estimates. Sampling designs should seek to maximize the number of

404

encounters with a target species. using a number and spacing of detectors that capture the movement

405

of the species of interest, while maintaining independence across detectors (Keiter et al., 2017).

406

Finally, we note that detection zones can also be affected by placement. Cameras placed in

407

shallow streams, for example, could have their detection zone cut at the top by the surface and at the

408

bottom by the substrate. In these cases, the resulting video frames can be cropped so that neither the

409

ground nor the surface are visible, and the fields of vision and capture frequency recalculated

410

accordingly (this would be equivalent to having a camera with narrower field of vision). If topography

411

permits, one can prevent the issue of an incomplete detection zone by placing the camera in mid-water

412

such that neither the water surface nor the bottom are visible. This would be a departure from current

413

designs that set cameras on the ground but would avoid the issue of cropping the detection zone. For

414

benthic species or very shallow streams none of these solutions might be feasible, and we would

415

recommend using a 2D approach.

416

In summary, we have proposed a method for estimating density in three dimensions using data

417

from remote detectors, which can be used in ecological and conservation research and as a monitoring

418

tool. The description of detection zones provided will be useful in translating other density estimation

419

methods that are also based on the ideal gas model (Campos-Candela et al., 2018; Moeller, Lukacs, &

420

Horne, 2018). There is an extensive and growing literature characterizing sampling requirements for

421

camera-traps in two dimensions, but such considerations are practically non-existent for species moving

422

in three dimensions (Burton et al., 2015; O’Connell, Nichols, & Karanth, 2010). Our analyses allow

423

extending these considerations to three dimensions, and it is our hope that our work will prompt new

424

study designs and applications of remote detection methods to study a broader range of species and

425

environments. We lay out the theoretical foundation of the method but recognize that it will require

426

empirical validation. The sampling of aquatic, airborne, and arboreal species each comes with intrinsic

427

challenges and field trials must be conducted to confirm that the method performs in real conditions as

428

well as predicted by simulations. Given the existing camera-trapping literature and the use of

429

underwater cameras to estimate abundance, we believe the application of our method will be more

430

straightforward in underwater censuses. The application to acoustic detectors will require further work

431

to characterize the detection zone, as currently there is no quantitative way to measure the detection

432

distance under different environmental conditions. Thus, the requirements of our method open new

433

avenues of research in remote detection.
