ABSTRACT

25

Environmental factors modify the physiology of microorganisms, allowing their survival in

26

extreme conditions. However, the influence of chemical contaminants on fungal virulence has

27

been little studied. Sporotrichosis is an emergent fungal disease caused by Sporothrix schenckii,

28

a soil-inhabiting fungus that has been found in polluted environments. Here, we evaluated the

29

adaptive stress response of S. schenckii induced by toluene, a key soil contaminant. The effect

30

on fungal virulence and host immune response was also assessed. The fungus survived up to

31

0.10% toluene in liquid medium. Greater production of melanosomes and enhanced activity

32

superoxide dismutase, associated to increased tolerance to H2O2 were observed in toluene-

33

exposed fungi. Intraperitoneal infection of mice with S. schenckii treated with either 0, 0.01 or

34

0.1% of toluene, resulted in greater fungal burden at day 7 post-infection in spleen and liver in

35

the groups infected with fungus treated with toluene 0.1%. A higher production of Il-1β, TNF-

36

α, IL-10 and nitric oxyde by peritoneal macrophages and IFNɣ, IL-4 and IL-17 by splenocytes

37

was also observed in that group. Our findings showed that morphological and functional

38

changes induced by toluene leads to increased S. schenckii virulence and antifungal host

39

immune response in our model.

Introduction

48

The impact of environmental factors on the emergence or outbreak of infectious diseases

49

has become a major concern in public health (Wilson 1995; Giraud et al., 2010; Casadevall et

50

al., 2003). Several lines of evidence show that acquired microbial resistance to extreme

51

environmental factors can also enhance their resistance to host immune mechanisms, leading

52

to increasing virulence (Casadevall et al., 2003; Casadevall and Pirofski 2007).

53

Sporotrichosis is a worldwide subcutaneous mycosis caused by thermodimorphic fungi of the

54

genus Sporothrix that contain several pathogenic species including S. brasiliensis, S. schenckii

55

sensu stricto, S. globosa, and S. luriei. (Marimon et al., 2007; Rodriguez et al., 2018). These

56

fungi are naturally found in soils plentiful in cellulose, with a pH range of 3.5 to 9.4, a mean

57

temperature of 31 °C, and a relative humidity above 92% (Téllez et al., 2014). People acquire

58

sporotrichosis by inoculation of fungal conidia in the environment after a traumatic lesion and

59

more rarely by inhalation and mucosal contact (Barros et al., 2011). Currently, zoonotic

60

transmission, mainly by cat scratch, is becoming a health problem in Brazil (Gremião et al.,

61

2017). In recent decades, sporotrichosis has transformed from a rare disease to an emergent

62

mycosis with an alarming growing incidence in several tropical and subtropical (Carlos and

63

Batista-Duharte 2015; Chakrabarti et al., 2014).

64

Sporotrichosis outbreaks have been described in large areas of poverty with a high

65

demographic density and precarious sanitary and health system (Barros et al., 2008; Silva et

66

al., 2012). S. schenckii species has been isolated in highly polluted environments with chemical

67

contaminants. (Dixon et al., 1991; Ulfig 1994; Ulfig and Lukasik 1996; Kusuhara 2009;

68

Pečiulytė 2010). Several studies have also shown that S. schenckii is able to resist the effect of

69

radiation (Torres-Guerrero and Arenas-López 1998; de Souza Lacerda et al., 2011), very low

70

temperatures (Pasarell and McGinnis 1992; Mendoza et al., 2005; Ramírez-Soto et al., 2018.),

71

high osmotic pressure for several years (Borba and Oliveira 1992; de Capriles et al., 1993;

72

Mendoza et al., 2005) and high relative humidity (Ramírez-Soto et al., 2018.). These findings

73

suggest a robust ability of S. schenckii to resist extreme environmental conditions (Téllez et al.,

74

2014; Batista-Duharte et al. 2015).

75

A recent study of our group revealed that mice exposed to mercury (II) chloride

76

enhances susceptibility to S. schenckii sensu stricto infection (Batista-Duharte et al., 2018).

77

However, there are not studies on the effects of chemicals pollutants on Sporothrix spp biology

78

(Téllez et al., 2014; Ramírez-Soto et al., 2018).

79

Aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers,

80

collectively known as BTEX, are one of the major contributors to environmental pollution.

81

BTEX are extensively used as solvents in many industrial processes and as base reagents for

82

the production of chemicals products. In addition, BTEX are components of gasoline and

83

aviation fuels. They are often released in the environment during production, transport, use and

84

disposal, causing groundwater, surface water, and soil contamination. Toluene has been found

85

in at least 1,012 of the 1,699 National Priorities List sites identified by the Environmental

86

Protection Agency (EPA) and it is included in the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease

87

Registry (ATSDR) 2017 substance priority list, which is based on a combination of their

88

frequency, toxicity, and potential for human exposure (Agency for Toxic Substances and

89

Disease Registry. ATSDR’s Substance Priority List. 2017).

90

Prenafreta-Boldu isolated several fungi, including S. schenckii, in biofilters exposed to

91

polluted air or hydrocarbon gas streams. The data from this research showed that volatile

92

hydrocarbon-degrading strains are closely related to a very restricted number of pathogenic

93

fungal species that cause severe mycoses, especially neurological infections, in

94

immunocompetent individuals (Prenafeta-Boldú et al., 2006).

95

To date, there have been no studies examining the influence of chemical contaminants

96

on the biology of S. schenckii sensu latu. Given that this fungus inhabits soils and this niche is

97

frequently contaminated with oil and their products, the objective of this work was to evaluate

98

the resistance of this fungus to toluene and it influence on fungal virulence. The results of this

99

work can help to understanding how chemical contamination can influence fungal virulence

100

and possibly certain sporotrichosis outbreaks in contaminated regions.

101

Materials and Methods

102

Microorganisms and preparations

103

The S. schenckii sensu stricto strain ATCC 16345 (here named as S. schenckii) used in this

104

experiment was originally obtained from a human case of diffuse lung infection (Baltimore,

105

MD) and kindly provided by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The

106

mycelial phase was maintained at room temperature in Mycosel (BD Biosciences) agar slants.

107

A piece of the fungal mycelium (approximately 1 cm2) was grown in 100 mL of Sabouraud

108

Dextrose Broth (SDB) (Difco, Detroit, USA) for 4 days on a rotatory shaker at 130 rpm and

109

30°C. The conidia were then isolated from the hyphae by filtration through several layers of

110

sterile gauze using a Buchner funnel and suspended in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline

111

(PBS). After incubation, conidia aliquots were seeded for the different experiments in SDB

112

medium and then incubated for 5 days under the same conditions described above.

113

Effect of toluene concentration on S. schenckii growth

114

Tests were performed in 125-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of SDB and sealed with

115

Teflon Mininert valves (SUPELCO, 24 mm) to prevent evaporation of the solvent. SDB was

116

supplemented with toluene at different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1.0 e 10.0% (vol/vol)). An

117

aliquot of 1x107 conidia was inoculated and incubated at 30°C and 130 rpm on a rotatory shaker.

118

Control cultures without toluene were included. Fungal survival was determined after 24 hours

119

of incubation by counting Colony Forming Units (CFU) on Petri dishes containing Sabouraud

120

Dextrose Agar (SDA). Percent survival was determined by comparing the number of colonies

121

of fungal cell grown with toluene to those grown non-toluene.

122

Fungal growth in toluene.

123

The growth of S. schenckii in two concentrations of toluene was evaluated according to the

124

previous results and under the same conditions. The fungal growth was monitored during five

125

days by CFU count. The LIVE/DEAD® Yeast Viability Kit (Molecular Probes) dye test was

126

performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, to evaluate the cell viability

127

during the exponential phase of the fungal cultures. Samples were visualized on the BH50

128

fluorescence microscope (Olympus) using the fluorescein and DAPI filters for the FUN1 and

129

Calcofluor White M2R stains, respectively.

130

Toluene consumption by fungal cells.

131

Cultures supplemented with 0.01% (v/v) toluene were used to evaluate the growth and

132

consumption of solvent. Tests were performed as previously described. The concentration of

133

toluene in the cultures was quantified by autosampler injection in headspace on a gas

134

chromatograph (GC) (Perkin Elmer-Clarus 680) equipped with a flame ionization detector

135

(FID). A sample was injected into an Elite-624 column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 1.4 µm; 6%-

136

cyanopropylphenyl-94% dimethylpolysiloxane). Helium served as the carrier gas (1 mL/min)

137

and hydrogen as the fuel gas for FID. Residual toluene was quantified by comparison of the

138

area under of the curve determined by chromatography with those obtained for the curves

139

standards. Samples were collected every 24 hours and analyzed under the same conditions as

140

the standards.

141

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

142

Conidia grown for 5 days in 0; 0.01 and 0.10% toluene were studied by TEM to evaluate

143

morphological modifications. Conidia were incubated overnight at 4°C in fixation solution

144

containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2)

145

(Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were then washed three times, exposed to potassium dichromate and

146

stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate overnight at 4 °C. The samples were washed, soaked in agar

147

and cut into small cubes of approximately 0.5 to 1 mm3, and they were dehydrated in increasing

148

concentrations of ethanol, placed in Spurr resin, sectioned in ultrafine blocks with an

149

ultramicrotome and placed in copper grids. The observations were performed using a Jeol JEM-

150

100 CXII transmission electron microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-HR digital

151

camera. Digital images were captured at 5,000X and 40,000X. The thickness of the cell wall

152

was determined using four independent measures for each image, from the random placement

153

of a grid of cardinal points (Renzoni et al., 2011). The reported values represent the mean of 42

154

cells for each group. Measurements were determined using ImageJ software. The conidial area

155

was measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD USA).

156

SOD activity assay

157

SOD activity was photochemically assayed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (NATIVA-PAGE)

158

based on the nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) photoreaction and in Tris-glycine buffer under non-

159

denaturing conditions according (Kuo et al.,. 2013; Weydert and Cullen 2010).

160

The SOD enzyme extract was prepared according to Niyomploy et al., (2014) with some

161

modifications. Fungal cells were cultivated with 0.01 and 0.10% (v/v) of toluene as described

162

above. Cell cultures were centrifuged at 500xg for 10 minutes and washed three times with ice

163

cold 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5). Five grams of fungal mass from each treatment were

164

sonicated with 25 mM Tris/HCl extraction buffer (pH 8.5), containing 2 mM DTT (Sigma-

165

Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), and 5 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Sigma-Aldrich,

166

St. Louis, USA), and 1 mM PMSF to prevent proteolytic activity. The supernatants were

167

collected after centrifugation and then subjected to 80% ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4. The

168

mixtures were incubated overnight, and then centrifuged at 17880xg for 30 minutes. The

169

precipitates were resuspended, dialysed with deionized water and concentrated in tubes

170

AMICON Ultra-3k (Merck-Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

171

Concentrated volumes were collected and quantified. The samples were stored at -80 °C until

172

separation in electrophoresis to determine the enzymatic activity. The entire extraction and

173

purification process was carried out at 4 ° C.

174

Sensitivity to oxidative stress

175

Aliquots of 2x107 conidia/mL grown for 5 days in 0; 0.01 and 0.10% toluene were suspended

176

in sterile deionized water. Exponential dilutions of this aliquot were performed in 96-well

177

plates containing the different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (between 0 and 125

178

mM) and incubated at 28 °C for 90 minutes under mild agitation. Then, each dilution was

179

seeded in Petri dish containing SDA and incubated at room temperature during 6 days. The

180

addition of fungus without toluene served as a control (Ramírez-Quijas et al., 2015).

181

Measurement of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)

182

The ROS-specific dye DHR-123 is oxidized to the fluorescent rhodamine 123 by the

183

intracellular ROS that could be detected by flow cytometry. Endogenous ROS was measured

184

as previously described (Shao et al. 2016) with modifications using the fluorescent dye

185

dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR-123, Sigma–Aldrich, USA). The results were recorded and

186

analyzed using a FACS Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, USA).

187

Animals and experimental design

188

To determine whether changes induced by toluene in the in fungal cells caused modifications

189

in their virulence, we used an experimental model of systemic S. schenckii infection described

190

by Ferreira et al., 2015. Male BALB/c mice, 5–7 weeks old at the time of inoculation, were

191

purchased from “Centro Multidisciplinar para Investigacão Biológica na Área da Ciência de

192

Animais de Laboratório” (CEMIB), UNICAMP University (Brazil). Animals were housed in

193

individually ventilated cages in an ambient with controlled temperature and 12-h light/dark

194

cycles. Water and food were offered ad libitum. Animals were intraperitoneally inoculated with

195

106 S. schenckii conidia cells grown with toluene or at either 0.01 or 0.1% toluene

196

concentration. For inoculation conidia were suspended in PBS (106 conidia/mL). A control non-

197

infected group was inoculated with an equal volume of PBS alone. Assessment of the systemic

198

fungal load was performed at day 7th post-infection by counting the CFU grown on Mycosel

199

agar plates of liver and spleen macerates. All animal procedures were approved by the Research

200

Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Araraquara – Estadual Paulista

201

University (UNESP) (Protocol nº 48/2015) and were in accordance with the National Institutes

202

of Health Animal Care guidelines and the guidelines of the Brazilian College of Animal

206

Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were harvested from male Balb/c mice

207

3 days after i.p. inoculation with 3% sodium-thioglycollate, which was performed by washing

208

the peritoneal cavity with 5.0 mL of sterile PBS, pH 7.4. The cells were cleaned twice by

209

centrifugation at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C and washing with sterile PBS, pH 7.4. The cells were

210

then resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100

211

μg/mL streptomycin, 5 × 10−2 M mercaptoethanol, and 5% inactivated fetal calf serum

212

(Sigma), referred to as RPMI-1640 complete (RPMI-1640C)medium. PECs were manually

213

counted in a Neubauer chamber (Boeco, Germany), and the concentration was adjusted to 5 ×

214

106 PEC/mL in RPMI-1640C for use in the following experiments. 0.1 mL PEC suspensions

215

containing 5 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI-1640C were added to each well of a 96-well tissue culture

216

plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a supply of 5% CO2. Next, non-adherent cells were

217

removed by discarding the supernatants and refilling each well with 0.1 mL of RPMI-1640C

218

medium (Batista-Duharte et al., 2016).

226

For the evaluation of NO content, the Griess reaction was used. Briefly, 100 μL of supernatant

227

was incubated with 100 μL of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis,

228

MO, USA), 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediaminedihydrochloride (NED, Sigma Chemicals,

229

235

suspension was added with 6mL of a 0.17Mammonium chloride solution and then incubated

236

on ice for 5 min. The splenocytes were then separated from the supernatant by centrifugation

237

at 300×g for 5 min at 4 ◦C, washed once with 3mL of RPMI complete medium and then

238

resuspended in 1mL of the same medium. Cell concentration was determined by microscopy

239

using the Trypan blue exclusion test and then the splenocytes were adjusted to 5×106 cells/mL

Results and discussion

253

Effect of toluene concentration on S. schenckii

254

The fungal cell concentration (CFU) drastically decreased when grown to 0.01% toluene by

255

approximately 80% in 24 hours, while 0.10 caused more than 90% mortality. Higher

256

concentrations were lethal for 100% of the seeded conidia (Figure 1 A). The (CFU) decreased

257

0.38 log units, while at 0.10% it was reduced 1,394 units when compared to the fungus growing

258

without toluene.

259

Growth in toluene. Consumption by fungal cells.

260

All cultures started from a viable cell concentration of 1,5x106 CFU/mL. Both concentrations

261

of toluene produced a reduction of the population at the first 24 hours. At concentration of

262

0.01% toluene the fungal population was reduced between 1.5 and 2 log units, to about 6.13x104

263

CFU/mL. After the latency phase the fungus increased the CFU and at 5 days of incubation

264

reached a concentration of 1.47x107 CFU/mL on average. At concentration of 0.01% toluene

265

the fungal population was reduced from 6.21 to 3.89 log units (7.76x103 CFU/mL), completing

266

268

were checked on the fifth day by Calcofluor and Fungal V staining, respectively. The tests

269

confirmed the presence of structurally integrated and metabolically active mycelia in control

270

and treated fungi (Figure 1 D).

271

Moreover, the consumption of toluene by growing S. schenckii was evaluated at 0.01% for 5

272

days and a culture free of toluene was used as control. As shown in Figure 1C, during the first

273

24 hours toluene concentration in the culture remained unchanged. After this interval, the

274

solvent decreases in correspondence with the beginning of the exponential growth phase of the

275

fungus. Approximately 26% of the toluene supplied to the study system was consumed at 72

276

hours after initiation of incubation. A continuous reduction in toluene concentration was

277

observed as cell concentration increased. This result suggest that S. schenckii was able to

278

metabolize toluene, as previously described (Prenafeta-Boldú et al., 2006).

279

Conidial morphological changes

280

Figure 2 shows the ultrastructural changes in non-treated and toluene-treated fungal conidia

281

under transmission microscopy. Conidia from fungi exposed to toluene showed a higher

282

number of black-colored electrodense bodies (melanosomes) in the cytoplasm and a reduction

283

in the thickness of the cell wall compared to non-exposed conidia (Figure 2A,B,C). The number

284

of conidia with melanosomes was also higher in conidia grown in toluene compared with non-

285

exposed conidia Figure 2D). Conidia with low-density electron structures in the periphery and

286

high-density structures in the center were also observed (Figure 2A), which appeared to be

287

melanosomes in the early stages of formation (Upadhyay et al., 2016).

288

Melanin is a virulence factor that enhances fungal resistance to environmental stressors and

289

immune responses in the host (Eisenman and Casadevall 2012). The natural presence of

290

melanin has been demonstrated in S. schenckii species and it favors the fungal virulence and

291

resistance to antifungal drugs (Morris-Jones et al., 2003; Madrid et al., 2011; Almeida-Paes et

292

al., 2016). Here, increased production of cytoplasmic melanosomes in different phases of

293

formation was observed in conidia of fungi exposed to toluene, especially at the highest

294

concentration. Different reports have revealed that fungal melanization occurs in specialized

295

vesicles that are analogous to mammalian melanosomes. Melanization in vesicles in form of

296

melanosomes is necessary because the reaction generates different highly reactive

297

intermediates that self-react to create melanin. Thus, melanosomes can protect the cells from

298

the toxic effects of these metabolites (Nosanchuk et al., 2015). Internal melanosomes or

299

melanosome-like structures has been observed in Fonsecaea pedrosoi (Alviano et al., 1991;

300

Franzen et al., 1999; 2008). C. albicans (Walker et al., 2010), Cladosporium carrionii,

301

Hormoconis resinae (San-Blas et al., 1996).

302

Garrison et al., (1979) reported for the first time the presence of electro opaque bodies (EOB)

303

in the cytoplasm of S. schenckii yeasts contained in biopsy material obtained from naturally-

304

occurring disseminated feline sporotrichosis. The inclusions described were analogous to EOB

305

previously reported in S. schenckii hyphae by the same group (Garrison et al., 1977). Although

306

the EOBs described by Garrison and coworkers were structurally similar to the later described

307

melanosomes-like structures, these authors did not relate these structures to melanin formation.

308

This function was proposal was recently proposal by Almeida-Paes et al., (2017) in S. schenckii

309

yeast. In our study, the stimulation of melanosomes production under fungal stress in S.

310

schenckii conidia is reported for the first time.

311

The expression of SOD was evaluated by non-denaturing electrophoresis. In the gel, SOD was

312

clearly identified as achromatic bands owing to the inhibition of NBT. Inhibition of NBT is a

313

measure of the amount of SOD present in the sample and shows the detoxification capacity of

314

the fungus in the presence of toluene. In the control sample (without toluene), there was low

315

expression of SOD, at least at the tested levels (Figure 3C). Qualitatively, the production of

316

catalase was observed by the immediate effect of H2O2 on colonies of S. schenckii that grew in

317

the presence of toluene and non-treated fungi. In the first 15 seconds, fungal colonies that grew

318

in the presence of 0.1% toluene exhibited more profuse and prolonged bubble formation than

319

both the control group and those grown in the presence of 0.01% toluene (Figure 3D).

320

S. schenckii grown in toluene becomes more resistant to stress by hydrogen peroxide

321

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production increases in fungi due to various stress agents such

322

as starvation, radiation, mechanical damage, and others deleterious effects (Gessler et al. 2007).

323

The main mechanism responsible for the detoxification of ROS depends on enzymatic systems

324

formed mainly by antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione

325

peroxidase, among others (Angelova et al 2005). Fungal resistance to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)

326

depends on the effectiveness of their antioxidant system and it is associated to fungal virulence.

327

Compared with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which exhibits great sensitivity to hydrogen

328

peroxide challenges, pathogenic Candida albicans has a high natural resistance to oxidant

329

agents (Pedreño et al., 2006).

330

Studies have demonstrated that toluene triggers the expression of fungal antioxidants to induce

331

cell detoxification and to reduce the impact of the damage caused by ROS (Blasi et al., 2017).

332

In this study, fungi growing at 0.01 and 0.10% toluene showed marked resistance to H2O2.

333

Those fungi that grew in the presence of 0.10% toluene showed more robust growth when

334

compared to the fungi that were not grown to toluene (control). They were able to grow at

335

double the concentration of H2O2; the non-treated fungi with toluene were resistant up to 31.25

336

mM of H2O2, while the fungus treated with 0.01% and 0.10% toluene were resistant up to 31.25

337

and 62.5 mM of H2O2, respectively (Figure 3A).

338

The intracellular ROS was measured with DHR-123 dye, which is oxidized to Rhodamine 123

339

by ROS, and then detected using a flow cytometer. Non-treated conidia with toluene produced

340

more ROS that those treated with toluene after exposure to H2O2 (Figure 3B). As show in Figure

341

3A, D, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) conidia non-grown in toluene and exposed to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/539775; this version posted February 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

342

H2O2 presented high levels of ROS. Levels of intracellular ROS of conidia grown in toluene

343

and exposed to H2O2 were lower when compared with those not treated with toluene but

344

exposed to the oxidant (Figure 3B,C,D).

345

Cladophialophora immunda strains are environmental fungi that cause opportunistic

346

subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis in immunosuppressed patients (Badali et al., 2008).

347

Members of this group show a special association with hydrocarbon-polluted environments and

348

can grow in the presence of toluene as the sole carbon and energy source. Melanization and the

349

presence of a powerful antioxidant system are two characteristics of this species that allow C.

350

immunda to survive in contaminated environments and simultaneously participate in its

351

pathogenicity (Blasi et al., 2016). Experimental exposure to toluene, similar to the present

352

study, triggers C. immunda expression of antioxidants as well as genes involved in cell

353

detoxification (Blasi et al., 2016).

354

Adaptive stress response increases S. schenckii virulence

355

Our next step was to assess the fungal virulence and the immune host response against S.

356

schenckii after exposed our non-exposed to toluene. As seen in figure 4, fungi exposed to

357

toluene achieved greater colonization in liver and spleen manifested by a higher count of colony

358

- forming units in both organs, mainly in animals infected with conidia treated at the highest

359

concentration of toluene.

360

In parallel, proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide produced by peritoneal macrophages in

361

infected mice were quantified after in vitro stimulation with HKC conidia. The highest

362

production of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10 and NO was observed in the group infected with 0.10%. A

363

balanced production of the proinflammatory IL-1β, TNF-α and the antinflammatory cytokine

364

IL-10 is estimulated during S. schenckii infection (Alegranci et al., 2013; Maia et al., 2016).

365

However, although NO is also stimulated and it has an antifungal effect in vitro against this

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/539775; this version posted February 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

366

fungus, it also seems to have an immunosuppressive effect that favors fungal infection

367

(Fernandes et al., 2008; Gonzalves et al., 2015).

368

The response of IFN-ɣ, IL-4 and IL-17 triggered by splenocytes from infected mice were also

369

assessed after in vitro stimulation with HKC. These cytokines were quantified in the culture

370

supernatants to evaluate the T helper cell type 1 (Th1), Th2 and Th17 responses respectively.

371

A greater response of all these mediators was observed in the animals infected with the treated

372

fungi, principally those that grew at the highest concentration of toluene (Fig 4). Several studies

373

reveals that a Th1 and Th17 are stimulated during S. schenckii infection and they are important

374

for the fungal clearance (Ferreira et al., 2015; Gonçalves et al., 2017; Batista-Duharte et al.,

375

2018). Interestingly, a recent report of our group reveled that both S. schenckii and the more

376

virulent S. brasiliensis stimulate similar Th1 response, but S. brasiliensis induced a more severe

377

disease associated with sustained Th17 and a regulatory T cells (Tregs) responses than S.

378

schenckii (Batista-Duharte et al., 2018). We are developing new analyzes to deepen the

379

immunological mechanisms associated with the greater virulence of the group infected with the

380

fungus exposed to 0.1% of toluene observed in this study.

381

In summary, our results provide, for the first time, evidence that exposure of S. schenckii to soil

382

contaminant concentrations of toluene can induce fungal modifications that could contribute to

383

virulence. New studies are being conducted to elucidate the biochemical and molecular changes

384

at the cellular level in response to exposure to toluene and other related xenobiotics, as well

385

as=other changes induced in the immune system. These results support the hypothesis that the

386

environment has a direct influence on the virulence of the fungus and constitutes an attractive

387

way to explain, at least in part, some cases of sporotrichosis outbreaks in highly polluted

388

regions.
