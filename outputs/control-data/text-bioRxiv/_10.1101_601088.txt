Abstract

Tissue acidosis can be a consequence of numerous disease states including stroke,
myocardial infarction, limb ischemia, and inflammation. Blood vessels existing in the
affected tissues are associated with the progression of acidosis-related diseases. However,
the mechanisms by which endothelial cells (ECs) lining the affected blood vessels sense
and respond to an acidic microenvironment remain largely unclear. We investigated the
functional effects of the proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptor GPR4 in acidosisinduced endothelial inflammation. GPR4 is highly expressed in ECs and known to
regulate EC inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses within acidic
microenvironments. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that
GPR4 activation by acidosis increases EC paracellular gap formation and permeability.
We further demonstrate that GPR4-mediated paracellular gap formation is dependent on
the Gα12/13 signaling pathway. To assess the functional role of GPR4 in the inflammatory
response in vivo, we utilized an acute hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion mouse model. We
demonstrate that both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of GPR4 reduce
tissue edema, exudate formation, endothelial adhesion molecule expression, and
leukocyte infiltration in the inflamed tissue. Collectively, these data suggest
GPR4/Gα12/13 signaling mediates acidosis-induced endothelial paracellular gap formation
and permeability. This study implicates GPR4 as a candidate therapeutic target for the
remediation of inflammation and tissue edema.

Introduction

The endothelium is a dynamic barrier that can mediate the transvascular
movement of fluids and immune cells between the peripheral blood and interstitial
tissues. During active inflammation, the production of numerous inflammatory mediators
within the inflammatory loci can increase endothelial gap formation and vascular
permeability which facilitate leukocyte infiltration and exudate formation in the inflamed
tissues [1-3]. Accumulating evidence suggests that microenvironmental factors, such as
acidic pH, can stimulate endothelial cell inflammation [4-8]. Inflammatory tissues are
characteristically acidic, owing in part to hypoxia and increased glycolytic metabolism of
cells and infiltrated leukocytes resulting in heightened proton accumulation. The acidic
tissue microenvironment is associated with a wide range of inflammation-associated
disease states such as arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, myocardial infarction, stroke,
and limb ischemia. Previous reports note that local pH ranging from 6.0 to 7.0 is common
in the microenvironments of inflamed tissues, solid tumors, and ischemic tissues [9-12].
In ischemic disease, one study demonstrated that within 50 minutes of coronary artery
occlusion, local tissue extracellular pH decreased from 7.4 to 5.5 in domestic pigs [13].
Furthermore, in the tourniquet-induced rabbit limb ischemia model, local tissue pH
decreased rapidly within 1 hour and dropped from 7.30 to 6.36 during the 4 hour course
of limb ischemia [14]. In summary, an acidic interstitial pH is an inflammatory
microenvironmental factor in many pathological conditions and has been demonstrated to
modulate tissue, blood vessel, and immune cell functions [9-12].

Cells can sense extracellular acidification through multiple molecular sensors
such as acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), transient receptor potential (TRP), and
proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [7, 11, 15, 16]. GPR4 is a member
of the proton-sensing GPCR family, which also includes GPR65 (TDAG8) and GPR68
(OGR1) [7, 11, 16-18]. GPR4 is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and
has been shown to increase the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,
adhesion molecules, and ER stress related genes upon activation by acidic pH in ECs [4,
6, 8]. GPR4 has also been shown to potentiate inflammation in vivo. Recent studies found
that the genetic deletion of GPR4 in mouse colitis models decreased the expression of
endothelial adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and E-Selectin in the intestinal
microvasculature which was associated with reduced mucosal leukocyte infiltration and
intestinal inflammation [19, 20]. Furthermore, GPR4 was shown to increase tissue injury
in a renal ischemia-reperfusion mouse model [21].
Our current study focuses on the GPR4-mediated endothelial paracellular gap
formation and vessel permeability in the inflammatory response. Using genetic and
pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that activation of GPR4 by acidosis induces
endothelial paracellular gap formation and permeability through the Gα12/13 signaling
pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the genetic deletion and pharmacological
inhibition of GPR4 decrease blood vessel permeability, tissue edema, and leukocyte
infiltration in the acute hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion mouse model. Our data suggest
that GPR4 has a proinflammatory role in the regulation of the inflammatory response.

known as NE-52-QQ57), was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals (Basel,
Switzerland). The vehicle for GPR4 antagonist 13 was a combination of 0.5%
methylcellulose purchased from BioConcept AG (Allschwil, Switzerland) and 0.5%
Tween-80 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and 99% water.

Cell culture
Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human pulmonary
artery endothelial cells (HPAEC), and human lung microvascular endothelial cells
(HMVEC-Lung) (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA), and primary human colon
microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-Colon) (Cell Biologics Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for experimentation.
HUVEC and HPAEC were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium 2 (EGM-2), while
HMVEC-Lung and HMVEC-Colon were grown in EGM-2-MV medium (Lonza,
Walkersville, MD, USA). Cells were used within 8 passages for all experiments.

pQCXIP retroviral vectors were stably transduced into the HUVEC/vector and
HUVEC/GPR4 cells which were selected with 2µg/mL puromycin for 48 hours.

Gap formation assay
Endothelial cells were seeded at 1x105 cells/well in a 24-well tissue culture
treated plate and were cultured to a confluent monolayer. Intact cellular monolayers were
confirmed using a deep red cellular membrane dye (ThermoFisher, #C10046, Waltham,
MA, USA) and a live cell nuclear dye (ThermoFisher, #R37605, Waltham, MA, USA).
Endothelial cells were then treated with cell culture medium buffered to physiological pH
7.4 or acidic pH 6.4 for defined time points as previously described [4-6]. For assessment
of pharmacological inhibition of GPR4 in vitro, the GPR4 inhibitor (EIDIP, Dalton
Pharma) was added to the pH stimulation media following the GPR4 inhibitor
pretreatment for 1 hour in physiological pH 7.4 [5, 6]. Pictures of endothelial cell
monolayers were obtained hourly over a 5-hour period using the EVOS Digital Inverted
Microscope imaging system. ImageJ software (NIH) was used to quantify gap percentage
per field of view (FOV).

Fluorescent filamentous-actin stress fiber formation assessment
Following the gap formation assay, endothelial cells were washed with DPBS and
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. Cells were then permeabilized for 10
minutes with 0.1% Triton X-100 and stained with Rhodamine Phalloidin for 30 minutes
(Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO, USA). Cells were then washed in DPBS and mounted
with DAPI-containing Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, H-1200,

Burlingame, CA, USA). Cells were imaged using the EVOS Digital Inverted Microscope
imaging system.

Immunofluorescence
The endothelial cell monolayers in 24-well plates were treated with physiological
pH 7.4 or acidic pH 6.4 media for 5 hours. Following pH treatments, cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5
minutes and blocked with goat serum in phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20
for 1 hour. The cells were then incubated with VE-cadherin primary antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology, D87F2) in the blocking solution overnight at 4°C. Cells were
washed and incubated for 1 hour with Rhodamine Red-X goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody. The wells were then washed five times with PBS and mounted with a glass
cover slip using Vectashield with DAPI. The stained cells were viewed and pictures taken
with an EVOS Digital Inverted Microscope.

Cellular permeability assay
Endothelial cell monolayers were cultured to confluency on a Transwell
membrane insert with 0.4µm pores (Corning, NY, USA) within a 24-well plate and
subsequently treated with physiological pH 7.4 or acidic pH 6.4 media for 5 hours.
Following pH treatment, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran with average
molecular weight of 10,000 daltons (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted into
pH stimulation medium was added into the upper chamber of the Transwell insert at a
concentration of 1mg/mL. Subsequently, 1 mL of endothelial growth medium was also

added to the lower chamber and the Transwell was incubated for 30 minutes at 5% CO2
at 37°C. Following the incubation, 100µL of medium was drawn from the lower
chamber and the FITC-dextran signal was quantified with a microplate reader at
excitation/emission wavelength of 490/520 nm. The degree of cell permeability was
determined by comparing the FITC-dextran fluorescent signal from the treatment group
to the control group.

Tourniquet-based acute hindlimb ischemia and reperfusion murine model
All animal experiments were performed on 9-13-week old male and female mice.
GPR4 wild-type (WT) or GPR4-deficient (GPR4 KO) mice backcrossed into the
C57BL/6 genetic background for 11 generations were used [17]. To assess the
inflammatory response post ischemia-reperfusion, the mouse hindlimb ischemia
reperfusion injury model was employed using the pneumatic digital tourniquet cuff
system (Model DC1.6, Hokanson, Inc., Bellevue, WA, USA). Prior to tourniquet
application, a single dose of 0.03 mg/kg Buprenorphine analgesics was administered
subcutaneously to each mouse. Mice were then anesthetized with 1% isoflurane
inhalation and placed on a temperature-controlled pad followed by the tourniquet
application to the left proximal hindlimb under 200 mm Hg regulated pressure for 3hrs as
previously described [24]. During the tourniquet-induced hindlimb ischemia procedure,
the mouse breathing rate and body temperature was monitored. Mice were injected
subcutaneously with 0.5 mL warm saline at the 1.5 hour and 3 hour time points for
maintenance of hydration. After the tourniquet was released, the mice were placed into
the microisolation cages with soft bedding for a 21 hour hindlimb reperfusion. Hindlimb

circumference was measured before the procedure (baseline) and after the ischemiareperfusion (IR), and the change in hindlimb circumference (value after IR – value at
baseline) was used as an indicator to assess tissue edema. For the evaluation of GPR4
antagonist 13 (also known as NE-52-QQ57, Novartis) in the ischemia-reperfusion mouse
model, both C57BL/6J and GPR4 WT mice were used for experiments ranging from 9 to
13 weeks old. Mice were administered vehicle control (0.5% methylcellulose/ 0.5%
Tween 80/ 99% water) or GPR4 antagonist 13 at 30 mg/kg b.i.d. by oral gavage one day
prior to experimental procedure. Mice were given a second dose of vehicle or GPR4
antagonist 13 approximately 2 hours prior to tourniquet cuff procedure. The last dose of
either vehicle or GPR4 antagonist 13 was administered 6 hours into the reperfusion
phase. The dosage of 30 mg/kg b.i.d. was chosen because of the best efficacy observed in
a previous study [25]. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care & Use Committee of East Carolina University and were in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals administered by the Office of
Laboratory Animal Welfare, NIH.

Tissue collection and histological analysis
After the 24 hour hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion procedure, mice were
euthanized, and the lower body was dissected for tissue collection. Upon dissection,
inflammatory exudate within the interstitial space between upper leg muscle fibrous
sheath and skin from the tourniquet-affected hindlimb was weighed and collected. A
portion of the hindlimb skin containing inflammatory exudate was removed
approximately 20 x 6 mm and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for tissue processing. The

remaining exudate on the skin of the mouse was dissected and weighed. Tissues were
embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 7µm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
for histopathological analyses. For assessment of neutrophilic infiltration into
inflammatory exudate, pictures were taken from H&E tissue sections at five random
points with a 20x objective. Leukocytes with the distinct polymorphic nuclear
morphology were counted in each field of view using ImageJ software in a blind manner
as previously described [19]. Pictures were taken using the Zeiss Axio Imager A1
microscope.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on serial sections of 7µm paraffin
embedded skin with inflammatory exudate. Tissues were deparaffinized and hydrated to
water by a series of declining ethanol concentrations. Antigen retrieval was performed
using Tris-EDTA (pH 9.0) with 0.1% Tween 20 to assess endothelial VCAM-1 and Eselectin protein expression using the SuperPicture 3rd Gen Immunohistochemistry
detection system (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched
and endogenous mouse IgG in blood serum was blocked using the Mouse-on-Mouse
blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Subsequently, 10% normal
goat serum was used to block tissue followed by primary antibody incubation with antiVCAM-1 (Abcam, ab134047) and E-selectin (Abcam, ab18981, Cambridge, MA)
overnight at 4 °C and followed by incubation with secondary antibody. For detection, the
Rabbit Vectastain Elite ABC-HRP Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) was
employed according the manufacture’s protocol. The immunohistochemistry staining of

tissue with no primary antibody and non-ischemia-reperfusion mice were used for control
analysis (data not shown).
To assess mouse plasma IgG protein in the exudate, the mouse Vectastain Elite
ABC-HRP Kit was used (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Endogenous peroxidase
was quenched, blocking serum and biotinylated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was
used followed by ImmPACT DAB Peroxidase Substrate (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) to visualize IgG leakiness from plasma. Immunohistochemical staining
of tissue sections with no anti-mouse IgG antibody and the use of anti-Rabbit IgG
antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were used for negative control analysis
(data not shown). Pictures were taken with a Zeiss Axio Imager A1 microscope.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
ELISA was performed to measure the C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the serum
of mice treated with the GPR4 antagonist 13 or vehicle control. Immediately after the
mice were euthanized, blood was collected through cardiac puncture and allowed to form
clots. After centrifugation, mouse serum on top of the clots was collected and stored in a 80 oC freezer for further analysis. The CRP concentration in mouse serum was measured
using the mouse CRP ELISA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, RAB1121) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism software was used for statistical analysis. The results were
recorded as the mean ± standard error from at least three independent experiments. For

Results

Acidosis promotes paracellular gap formation in primary endothelial cells

Tissue acidosis commonly exists in inflammatory microenvironments [7, 11, 12,
16, 26]. However, the involvement of acidosis in endothelial cell (EC) gap formation is
largely unknown. Four primary vascular ECs were cultured to a confluent monolayer and
were treated with either physiological pH 7.4 or acidic pH 6.4 for 5 hours to assess
acidosis-induced paracellular gap formation. Under physiological pH 7.4, all ECs
maintained a cellular monolayer with no gap formation over the 5 hour time course.
However, under acidic pH 6.4 the cellular monolayers were disrupted and paracellular
gap formation was observed (Figure 1A). The gap formation of EC monolayers was
determined in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human pulmonary
artery ECs (HPAEC), human colon microvascular ECs (HMVEC-Colon), and human
lung microvascular ECs (HMVEC-Lung) by calculating the total percent area of gaps in
each field of view (Figure 1B-1E). ECs treated with acidic pH 6.4 for 5 hours developed
approximately 4-5 percent of gap area relative to the total area (Figure 1B-1E). No gaps,
however, could be detected within physiological pH conditions.

Acidosis stimulates endothelial paracellular gap formation through the protonsensing GPR4 receptor

To determine the role of the pH-sensing receptor GPR4 in acidosis-induced EC
gap formation, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to modulate GPR4
expression and activity, respectively. HUVECs were stably transduced with either control
(HUVEC/vector), GPR4 overexpression (HUVEC/GPR4), or GPR4 signaling-defective
mutant (HUVEC/GPR4 R115A) overexpression constructs. GPR4 knockdown was
achieved with transduction of GPR4 shRNA (HUVEC/GPR4 shRNA) and compared to
control shRNA (HUVEC/control shRNA). HUVECs were evaluated under physiological
pH 7.4 or acidic pH 6.4 for 5 hours. Treatment with physiological pH 7.4 resulted in no
observable gap formation. However, under acidic pH 6.4, HUVEC/vector cell
monolayers developed ~4% gap formation (Figure 2A). Overexpression of GPR4
significantly increased acidosis-induced gap formation by ~2.5 fold (~10-11%) under
acidic conditions when compared to HUVEC/vector. Conversely, HUVEC/GPR4 R115A
mutant decreased the percentage of gap area when compared to HUVEC/vector (~1.8%
vs. ~4%, respectively). Furthermore, knockdown of GPR4 by shRNA decreased the
percentage of gap area to ~2.5 percent in acidic pH 6.4 conditions when compared to
HUVEC/control shRNA (~4.5 percent) (Figure 2B).
We next assessed the effects of a GPR4 inhibitor (EIDIP) on acidosis-induced
paracellular gap formation in HUVEC/vector and HUVEC/GPR4 cells (Figure 2C and
2D). Pharmacological inhibition of GPR4 attenuated acidosis-induced gap formation. A
dose-dependent decrease in the acidosis-induced gap development could be observed

with increasing inhibitor concentrations during HUVEC/vector and HUVEC/GPR4
treatments when compared to vehicle (Figure 2C and 2D). The results indicate that
acidosis-induced EC paracellular gap formation is dependent on GPR4 activation by
acidic pH.

GPR4-mediated Gα12/13 signaling is involved in endothelial paracellular gap
formation in response to acidosis

Previous studies demonstrate that the Gα12/13/Rho GTPase pathway can regulate
cytoskeletal dynamics, endothelial gap formation, and endothelial permeability [27, 28].
In line with these observations, GPR4 can couple to Gα12/13 and Rho GTPase when
expressed in cancer cell lines [29, 30]. For this reason, we investigated the role of the
GPR4/Gα12/13 pathway in acidosis-induced EC gap formation. The p115 RGS Gα12/13
inhibitory construct [22, 23] was stably transduced into HUVEC/vector and
HUVEC/GPR4 cells. We next performed the gap formation assay under physiological
and acidic pH conditions for 5 hours. HUVEC/p115 RGS cells treated with acidic pH had
significantly reduced gap formation when compared to the vector control (Figure 3A and
3B). Furthermore, thiazovivin (TA) and staurosporine (STA), two chemical inhibitors for
Gα12/13 downstream effectors Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and myosin-light chain
kinase (MLCK), respectively [30], were used in HUVEC/vector and HUVEC/GPR4 cells
under physiological and acidic conditions. Thiazovivin significantly decreased gap
formation percentage by ~5 fold in HUVEC/vector and by ~10 fold in HUVEC/GPR4
cells when compared to the vehicle controls under acidic pH. Staurosporine nearly

abolished acidosis-induced gap formation in HUVEC/vector and HUVEC/GPR4 cells
(Figure 3C and 3D). Collectively, the results suggest that acidosis-induced EC gap
formation relies, at least in part, on the GPR4/Gα12/13 pathway. Additionally, our results
demonstrated that acidosis also induced F-actin stress fiber formation and decreased VEcadherin expression at the site of paracellular gaps in ECs (Supplemental Figures 1 and
2).

Acidosis increases endothelial cell permeability through GPR4

We next assessed if GPR4-dependent paracellular gap formation can functionally
result in increased endothelial permeability. Endothelial permeability was assessed by the
fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran (FITC-dextran) permeability assay
whereby diffusion of FITC-dextran through the endothelial monolayer from the upper to
lower chamber of the Transwell insert was assessed. Cells were treated with
physiological pH 7.4 or acidic pH 6.4 for 5 hours followed by the addition of FITCdextran. Acidic pH treatment significantly increased FITC-dextran permeability in
HUVEC/vector cells when compared to physiological pH. Moreover, when GPR4 is
overexpressed and treated with acidic pH there was a further increase in acidosis-induced
FITC-dextran when compared to HUVEC/vector cells. When GPR4 expression is
knocked down or signaling is defective (R115A mutant) [4], FITC-dextran permeability
was significantly decreased compared to controls under acidic conditions (Figure 4).
These results suggest that acidosis increases EC permeability through GPR4.

Genetic deletion of GPR4 reduces tissue edema and inflammation in the acute
hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion mouse model

Next, we assessed the functional role of GPR4 in a tourniquet cuff–based acute
hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion mouse model [24]. This mouse model can cause severe
inflammation resulting in increased vessel permeability, tissue edema, and leukocyte
infiltration in the affected tissue. The ischemia-reperfusion associated inflammation was
induced in wild-type (WT) and GPR4 knockout (KO) mice. The sham and cuff limbs
were measured for circumference differences between pre- and post-procedure
measurements. GPR4 KO mice had less observable tissue edema in the tourniquetaffected limb following the ischemia and reperfusion event when compared to WT mice
(Figure 5).
Inflammatory exudates in the interstitial space between the skin and the limb
muscle/body peritoneum on the tourniquet subjected side were collected and measured
followed by histology (Figure 6). GPR4 KO mice had reduced inflammatory exudate
when compared to the WT mice (~6mg vs. ~65mg, respectively) (Figure 6A, 6B, and 6I).
Furthermore, histological analysis of the inflammatory exudates revealed GPR4 KO mice
had reduced leukocyte infiltrates when compared to WT (Figure 6D, 6F, and 6J). No red
blood cells were observed in the exudate suggesting the exudate is due to increased
vascular permeability but not vessel hemorrhaging (Figure 6A-6F). To further assess the
GPR4-mediated vessel permeability, we performed immunohistochemistry for plasma
protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) and detected IgG within inflammatory exudates (Figure
6G and 6H), indicating an increased vascular permeability to plasma protein.

Furthermore, less plasma IgG could be observed in the GPR4 KO cuff-affected tissues
compared to WT cuff-affected tissues indicating reduced endothelial cell permeability in
the KO (Figure 6G and 6H).
To provide a molecular explanation for GPR4 mediated inflammation within
vascular endothelial cells, we performed immunohistochemistry to examine the
expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin within the endothelium of the cuff and sham
affected hypodermis tissues. Overall, VCAM-1 and E-selectin protein expression was
increased within the cuff-affected limb vasculature when compared to sham (Figure 7).
Immunohistochemical analysis of VCAM-1 revealed expression on a variety of cell
types, such as skeletal muscle, fibroblast, and vascular endothelial cells which is
consistent with previous literature [31, 32]. Interestingly, we observed a decrease of
VCAM-1 protein expression on vascular endothelial cells in GPR4 KO cuff-affected
hypodermis of the limbs when compared to WT (Figures 7A-7D). E-selectin expression
was observed on endothelial cells and fibroblasts as previously reported [33-35]. Similar
as VCAM-1 expression patterns, there is an observable decrease in E-selectin protein
expression in GPR4 KO cuff-affected hypodermis of the limbs when compared to WT
(Figures 7E-7H).

Pharmacological inhibition of GPR4 reduces tissue edema, leukocyte infiltration,
and vascular permeability in the hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion mouse model

To further assess the role of GPR4, we incorporated the use of a highly potent and
selective GPR4 antagonist (referred to as GPR4 antagonist 13) [25] within the acute

hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion mouse model. Our results demonstrated that the GPR4
antagonist 13 significantly decreased upper and lower limb tissue edema measured by the
circumference of the leg compared to limbs of the vehicle control (Figure 8). In addition,
there were significantly less leukocyte infiltration within the inflammatory exudate in the
GPR4 antagonist 13 treated mice when compared to vehicle treated mice (Figure 9A, 9B,
and 9F). Furthermore, the exudate weight was also decreased in GPR4 antagonist 13
treated mice when compared to vehicle (Figure 9E). Additionally, vascular permeability
was assessed and there was a reduction in plasma IgG diffusion in the exudate by the
treatment of the GPR4 antagonist 13 when compared to vehicle treatment (Figure 9C and
9D). GPR4 antagonist 13 treatment also reduced the level of an inflammatory marker, Creactive protein (CRP), in the mouse serum (Supplemental Figure 3). To further examine
the role of GPR4 within ECs, we performed immunohistochemistry to analyze the
expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin within the endothelium of the cuff affected
hypodermis tissues. We observed that ECs in the GPR4 antagonist 13 treated mice had
reduced VCAM-1 and E-selectin protein expression compared to the vehicle treated mice
(Figure 10). Taken together, these data suggest that GPR4 can mediate inflammation,
vessel permeability, and leukocyte infiltration into inflamed tissues.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that activation of GPR4 by acidic pH can stimulate
endothelial inflammation through the mediation of paracellular gap formation and
permeability by the Gα12/13 pathway. We next evaluate the functional role of GPR4 in the

inflammatory response within the hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion mouse model using
GPR4-null mice and a selective GPR4 antagonist [25]. These data suggest that both the
genetic knockout and pharmacologic inhibition of GPR4 reduce the inflammatory
response in the ischemia-reperfusion mouse model. These results indicate GPR4 could be
a valuable therapeutic target for the remediation of inflammatory disease states.
The inflamed tissue microenvironment has been characterized by a loss of pH
homeostasis. Acidosis is a microenvironmental stress factor in which both stromal and
infiltrated immune cells exist and by which alters cellular function [7, 12, 16].
Interestingly, local acidosis has been described as a danger signal within ischemic and
inflamed tissues which can promote inflammation [36]. However, the way by which cells
sense the altered acidic microenvironment and subsequently alter the inflammatory
response has only recently been investigated. Cells can employ distinct acid sensing
mechanisms such as transient receptor potentials (TRPs), acid sensing ion channels
(ASICs) and proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [7, 15, 16, 37].
Proton-sensing GPCRs are activated by acidic pH through the protonation of several
histidine residues on the extracellular domains of the receptors which can induce
conformational changes in the GPCRs for subsequent G protein activation and
downstream signaling [18, 38]. The family of proton-sensing GPCRs include GPR4,
GPR65 (TDAG8), and GPR68 (OGR1). GPR65 and GPR68 are predominately expressed
in immune cells while GPR4 is expressed in endothelial cells [7, 11, 16, 26]. This family
of receptors have only recently been implicated in the regulation of post-ischemic cellular
responses and inflammation [16, 39-42].

For example, GPR68 has been suggested to have a cardioprotective function by
establishing a cellular protective border zone around the infarcted tissues [42]. GPR65
expression was increased in rat brains and inhibited neuronal apoptosis and post-ischemic
inflammatory responses following the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion
event [40]. Studies investigating the role of GPR4 under ischemic conditions are
predominately focused on the kidney [39]. A recent study demonstrated that GPR4
deficiency improved renal ischemia-reperfusion injury clinical parameters such as
survival rate, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels. Furthermore, genetic
deficiency of GPR4 deterred apoptosis by suppressing CHOP expression in the kidney
[21]. This study is consistent with our previous report demonstrating CHOP expression is
dependent on GPR4 activation in HUVECs [5, 6]. However, these studies did not
investigate the role of GPR4 in post-ischemic vessel permeability or inflammation.
Our current study reveals a novel role for GPR4 in governing endothelial
paracellular gap formation and permeability in response to acidic stress through the
Gα12/13 pathway. Using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrated
acidosis-induced GPR4 activation significantly increases the paracellular gap formation
and permeability when compared to physiological pH in vitro. A previous study reported
that GPR4 can reduce endothelial cell barrier function via lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)
[43]. However, the LPC-GPR4 ligand binding interaction were unable to be confirmed
[44]. Instead, GPR4 has been shown to function as a pH sensor [17, 18]. Altered
endothelial cells permeability can lead to detrimental complications, such as tissue
edema. Many diseases related to ischemia-induced inflammation are associated with
increased vascular permeability such as stroke, myocardial infarction, sepsis, and cancer

[45]. Our study suggests that GPR4 mediates endothelial paracellular gap formation and
permeability in response to acidotic stress within the acidic inflamed microenvironment.
For this reason, we further investigated the functional role of GPR4 in mediating acute
inflammation using the hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion mouse model.
In order to investigate GPR4 in the ischemia-reperfusion model, we used the
GPR4 knockout (KO) mice for comparison to wild-type (WT) mice. Our data
demonstrated that GPR4 KO mice had reduced parameters of acute inflammation such as
tissue edema, inflammatory exudate formation, leukocyte infiltration, and EC adhesion
molecule expression (VCAM-1 and E-selectin). These results suggest GPR4 mediates
ischemia/reperfusion-induced inflammation most likely through vascular inflammatory
programs such as increased vessel permeability and adhesion molecule expression. We
and others have previously demonstrated that GPR4 regulates endothelial cell
inflammation and ER stress responses [4-6, 8]. Activation of GPR4 in human endothelial
cells by acidic pH increased numerous inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, cellular
adhesion molecules, and ER stress related genes [5, 6]. Additionally, activation of GPR4
in HUVECs functionally mediated EC-leukocyte interactions of which is necessary for
the leukocyte extravasation process in the inflammatory response [4, 6]. The role of
GPR4 in the regulation of inflammation has recently been evaluated in vivo using the
dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model [19, 20]. GPR4 knockout
mice were protected from intestinal inflammation and had reduced adhesion molecule
expression in intestinal microvascular endothelial cells when compared to wild-type mice
[19]. These data suggest GPR4 potentiates inflammation likely through increased
vascular endothelial cell inflammatory responses and are consistent with observations

made in this current study and implicate GPR4 as a potential therapeutic target for the
remediation of acute and chronic inflammation.
Previous reports have indicated a group of imidazopyridine derivatives, found to
selectively inhibit GPR4, can reduce both endothelial cell inflammation in vitro and
tissue inflammation in vivo [5, 6, 8, 46, 47]. We previously demonstrated that GPR4
inhibitors can inhibit GPR4 activation in HUVECs following acidotic stimulation in vitro
which resulted in reduced expression of GPR4 mediated proinflammatory cytokines,
chemokines, and cellular adhesion molecules [5]. Previous in vivo studies evaluated
GPR4 inhibitors in myocardial infarction, arthritis, nociception, and angiogenesis mouse
models and demonstrated that GPR4 inhibition reduced the disease severity when
compared to vehicle control [46, 47]. Recently, GPR4 antagonist 13, a
pyrazolopyrimidine derivative was developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals as the next
generation of GPR4 inhibitors and found to be more selective for GPR4 inhibition and
orally active [25]. GPR4 antagonist 13 was also tested against other pH-sensing GPCRs,
the H3 receptor, and hERG channel and demonstrated high selectivity for GPR4. The in
vivo pharmacokinetics were also evaluated for GPR4 antagonist 13 and found to have
good profiles of oral delivery and clearance. GPR4 antagonist 13 was found to effectively
reduce arthritic inflammation, hyperplasia, angiogenesis, and colitis [25, 48].
We sought to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of GPR4 antagonist 13
within the hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion mouse model. Notably, we observed similar
effects of the pharmacological inhibition of GPR4 with GPR4 antagonist 13 when
compared to the genetic knockout of GPR4. Our results demonstrated that GPR4
exacerbated post-ischemia/reperfusion tissue inflammation. GPR4 antagonist 13

administration resulted in a decrease in gross edema clinical parameters, inflammatory
exudate formation, and leukocyte infiltration. Moreover, GPR4 antagonist 13 treatment
reduced endothelial permeability as evidenced by a decrease in plasma IgG protein
leakiness when compared to vehicle control. Immunohistochemical analysis of
proinflammatory modulators such as endothelial adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and Eselectin) were also decreased by GPR4 antagonist 13 compared to vehicle.
Taken together, this study demonstrates that GPR4 activation can induce
endothelial paracellular gap formation and permeability in vitro. Furthermore, evaluation
of the contribution of GPR4 in the hindlimb post-ischemia/reperfusion inflammatory
response supports the role for GPR4 in vascular permeability and inflammation. Genetic
knockout and pharmacological inhibition of GPR4 in vivo can decrease leukocyte
infiltration and the expression of endothelial adhesion molecule VCAM-1 and E-selectin,
and reduce vascular permeability as evidenced by attenuated plasma IgG leakiness into
the subcutaneous connective tissues and exudate formation. The results suggest that
inhibition of GPR4 can be exploited as a novel approach to alleviate inflammation and
tissue edema.
