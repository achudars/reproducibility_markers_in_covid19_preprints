Abstract
Cave adaptation has led to unique sensory specializations to compensate for the lack of visual
cues in aphotic subterranean habitats. As the role of vision is reduced or disappears, other
sensory modalities become hypertrophied allowing cave-adapted organisms to successfully
detect and interact their surrounding environment. The array of aquatic subterranean habitats,
from fast-flowing streams and waterfalls, to quiet phreatic pools, presents a diverse palette to
examine what possible sensory solutions have evolved against a backdrop of complete darkness.
Mechanosensation is enhanced in many subterranean animals to such an extent that a longer
appendage is recognized as a prominent troglomorphic adaptation in many metazoans. Fishes,
however, not only interact with the environment using their fins, but also with specialized
sensory organs to detect hydrodynamic events. We hypothesize that subterranean adaptation
drives the hypertrophy of the mechanosensory lateral line, but that other environmental forces
dictate the specific neuromast phenotype. To this end, we studied differences in the cephalic
lateral line of the fishes in the North American family Amblyopsidae, which includes surface,
cave-facultative, and cave-obligate species. None of the taxa we examined possessed canal
neuromasts on the head. Primarily surface-dwelling species, Chologaster cornuta and
Forbesichthys agassizii, possessed receded neuromasts throughout most of the head, with a few
on papillae located in front of the nostrils and on ventral grooves on each side of the mouth. The
cavefishes Amyblopsis spelaea and Typhlichthys subterraneous possessed papillate superficial
neuromasts all over the head. We speculate that the change from the surface to the cave
environment has led to papillate neuromasts in this group, which are likely shaped to detect the
hydrodynamic characteristics of the boundary layer created by the swimming fish. Moving

sensory organs from the surface of the body out into the boundary layer could increase
sensitivity to high frequency stimuli created by prey, predators, and conspecifics.

Introduction
Water currents are a pervasive feature of all aquatic environments and provide obvious cues
influencing fish behaviors. Fishes themselves can also create water displacement and pressure
fluctuations (Kalmijn 1989). Hydrodynamic stimuli provide important physical and biological
information about the surrounding environment, and fishes have evolved a unique
mechanosensory organ to detect hydrodynamic stimuli: the mechanosensory lateral line system
(Bleckmann 1994; Bleckmann and Zelick 2009). The lateral line system is present in all fishes
but varies in morphology and distribution.
The functional unit of the lateral line is the neuromast, which can be free standing on the skin
(i.e., surface or superficial neuromasts) or in canals that are open to the environments via pores
(i.e., canal neuromasts). The distribution of neuromasts across the body and head determines the
ability of a fish to detect moving as well as stationary stimuli. Each object, be it a rock or a
conspecific, creates a unique hydrodynamic signature. The information gained from these
hydrodynamic images influences many aspects of fish behavior. For example, fish use their
lateral line to examine novel objects (Teyke 1990; Deperera 2004), to detect prey (Hoekstra and
Janssen 1985; Janssen 1999; Yoshizawa et al. 2010), to monitor the movement of conspecifics
(Partridge et al., 1980; Faucher et al., 2010) and predators (McHenry et al., 2009), and to

maintain position in flowing water (Sutterlin and Waddy 1975; Montgomery et al. 1997).
Superficial and canal neuromasts differ in function and performance, but are overlapping in
hydrodynamic selectivity. Physiological studies have shown that canal neuromasts respond to
water movements that are produced by moving objects, such as prey, that is maximized in the
direction of the canal axis (Denton and Gray 1989; Montgomery et al. 1994). Canal neuromasts
typically occur in a distinct line at the base of a canal that runs and extends over the head and
flanks. In contrast, superficial neuromasts are located on the surface of the skin and preferentially
respond to the velocity of water flow that is not orthogonal to their orientation axis (Coombs and
Montgomery 1994; Montgomery et al. 1994; van Netten and Kroese 1989) and appear to be best
suited to encode flow velocity (Baker and Montgomery, 1999; Van Trump and McHenry 2013).
The principle sensory cell of the neuromast is the hair cell (Carton and Montgomery, 2004).
These hair cells have a bundle of stereovilli that grow longer from one side of the apical surface
to the other. A single true kinocilium occurs in the center on of the stereovilli bundle. The
stereovilli of superficial hair cells are embedded in a gelatinous matrix called the cupula, and the
cupula is drag coupled to the surrounding water. The motion of the hair cell bundles in the
neuromast generates electrical potentials that are transduced into action potentials in afferent
neurons (Mogdens and Bleckmann 2012). The relationship between cupula displacement and the
amplitude of the receptor potential is linear and can reach saturation (Curcic-Blake and Van
Netten 2006). These signals provide the central nervous system with information about water
flow around the body.
The evolution of the lateral line system can be crucial for fishes to adapt to novel
environments. For example, several studies have noted that species living in quieter, low-flow
habitats tend to have more superficial neuromasts than species living in higher-flow habitats

(Teyke 1990; Coombs et al. 1988; Janssen 2004). A similar response has been documented in
some cavefishes, where blind cave-dwelling taxa have more superficial neuromasts than in
related surface-dwelling populations that retain a functional visual system (Poulson 1963;
Niemiller and Poulson 2010; Yoshizawa et al. 2010, 2014). It is possible that rather than being
related to flow regime, morphological characteristics of the lateral line system may be an
adaptive response to living in perpetual darkness in subterranean habitats. In Mexican blind
cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, superficial neuromasts are longer and more sensitive than those of
related surface fish (Teyke 1990, Yoshizawa et al. 2014), which likely contributes to their ability
to better detect flow. Although it is recognized that cavefishes generally exhibit hypertrophy of
the lateral line system with respect to number and size of superficial neuromasts (Soares and
Niemiller 2013; Niemiller and Soares 2015), studies on neuromast morphology of cavefishes are
surprisingly few (Poulson 1963; Dezfuli et al. 2009; Jiang et al. 2016), with the most intensive
work on Astyanax (Teyke 1990; Baker and Montgomery 1999; Montgomery et al. 2001;
Yoshizawa et al. 2010, 2014).
We are interested in cephalic neuromasts specifically because they are crucial for the finetuning locomotion necessary for prey catching (MÃ¼ller and Schwartz 1982, Tittel et al. 1984;
Hoekstra and Janssen 1985, Janssen 1990; Janssen et al. 1995; Janssen 1996; Janssen and
Corcoran 1998, Schwarz et al. 2011), and they may be organized in a conformation that leads to
a mechanosensory fovea (Hoekstra and Janssen 1986, Coughlin and Strickler 1990). These
neuromasts are very diverse in morphology and organization (Coombs et al. 1994; Beckmann et
al. 2010), which are often related to the environment of the fish (Higgs and Furiman 1998;
Ahnelt et al. 2004; Schmitz et al. 2014). Neuromast phenotypes can consequently be used as a
diagnostic character for species delimitation (Kurawaka 1976, Reno 1966; Nelson 1972; Gosline

1974; Parin and Astakhov 1982; Stephens 1985; Webb 1989b; Arai and Kato 2003; Begman
2004). Functionally, cephalic neuromasts also contribute to rheotaxis (Baker and Montgomery
1999, Janssen, 2004) and schooling (Blaxter et al. 1983; Janssen et al. 1995; Pitcher 2001; Diaz
et al. 2003),
Here, we examine and compare the morphology of cephalic neuromasts in a family of fishes
that span the ecological gradient from surface to obligate cave inhabitationâthe Amblyopsidae
(Actinopterygii: Teleostei: Percopsiformes). The Amblyopsidae is comprised of six genera and
nine species in eastern North America (Niemiller and Poulson, 2010; Chakrabarty et al. 2014;
Armbruster et al., 2016). Although subterranean adaptation in fishes is quite common (Soares
and Niemiller 2013; Niemiller and Soares 2015), this family is unusual in that most species in
the family are stygobiotic (obligate subterranean). The swampfish (Chologaster cornuta) is a
small, pigmented species that lives in swamps of the Atlantic Coastal Plain and is the only
species in the family only found in surface habitats. All other recognized species are associated
with karst terrain of the Interior Low or Ozark plateaus and are at least partially cave-adapted.
The spring cavefishes, Forbesichthys agassizii and F. papilliferus, are facultative cave
inhabitants generally occurring in spring-fed streams and also caves on occasion in the Interior
Low Plateau karst region (Niemiller and Poulson 2010). All of other species in the family are
obligate inhabitants of caves and have evolved a suite of morphological, physiological, and
behavioral characters associated with subterranean life, most notably degeneration of eyes and
reduction of pigmentation (Niemiller and Poulson 2010; Soares and Niemiller 2013): Northern
Cavefish (Amblyopsis spelaea), Hoosier Cavefish (A. hoosieri), Alabama Cavefish
(Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni), Ozark Cavefish (Troglichthys rosae), Eigenmannâs Cavefish
(Typhlichthys eigenmanni), and Southern Cavefish (Ty. subterraneus). In this study, we describe

the morphology of cephalic neuromasts using scanning electron microscopy in four species of
amblyosids and compare among cave and surface taxa: C. cornuta, F. agassizii, A. spelaea, and
T. subterraneus. We hypothesize that subterranean adaptation has lead to the hypertrophy of the
cephalic mechanosensory lateral line in amblyopsid cavefishes.

Materials and Methods
Individuals of four amblyopsid species were collected under scientific permits issued by the
states of Tennessee (no. 1605) and Kentucky (no. SC1211135), USA in April 2012. We collected
three individuals of Forbesichthys agassizii from a quiet pool (10 m2, mean depth 0.6 m, mud/silt
substrate with abundant vegetation) of a spring run fed by Jarrell's Spring, Coffee Co.,
Tennessee, USA; three individuals of Chologaster cornuta from Colly Creek, Bladen Co., NC;
three individuals for each of the two cave-dwelling species: Amblyopsis spelaea from several
quiet pools (20â150 m2, mean depth 1 m, silt/sand/cobble substrate) in Under the Road Cave,
Breckinridge Co., Kentucky, USA and Typhlichthys subterraneus from several pools with some
current (4â12 m2, mean depth 0.5 m, cobble/bedrock substrate) in L&N Railroad Cave, Barren
Co., Kentucky, USA.
Four fishes we used for histology. Fish were euthanized by prolonged immersion in tricaine
methane sulfonate (MS222, 300 mg/l pH 7.2) then perfused with 0.9% NaCl followed by
Alcohol-Formalin-Acetic acid (AFA). Fish were decapitated and heads were placed in AFA
overnight. Heads were decalcified (RDO Gold, 20:1 ratio) under slow agitation until soft (1-2
days), were then imbedded in paraffin (Paraplast X-tra), and cut at 10um thickness in a rotating
microtome. Slides were rehydrated in a series of alcohol concentrations, stained with Cresyl
violet for 5 minutes, rehydrated, cleared (Histoclear) and cover slipped with permount. Scanning

electron microscopy (SEM) was used to differentiate and quantify the morphological features of
superficial neuromasts among amblyopsid cavefishes. Fish were euthanized by prolonged
immersion in tricaine methane sulfonate (MS222, 300 mg/l pH 7.2). Whole specimens were
fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% parafomaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer. Fish were
dehydrated in a series of increasingly concentrated ethanol baths before being critically point
dried and spur coated with 5 nm of gold-palladium in a Denton Vacuum Desk II. SEM samples
were imaged in an AMRAY 1620D (Bedford, MA, USA) scanning electron microscope at 10
kVâ30kV acceleration voltage. Scanning electron microscopy was performed at the Laboratory
for Biological Ultrastructure at the University of Maryland. We defined the area of the
neuromast as the surface that contains the entire footprint of the cupula and the sensory plate
area, as the smaller region that contains only sterocilia. Measurements were done with ImageJ
(open source, https://imagej.net). We sampled the entire head and operculum. We tested for
differences in neuromast surface area, kinocilium length, and sensory plate neuromast area
among species with analysis of variance followed by ad hoc Tukey HSD test using
Vassarstats.net. Values reported are mean Â± 1 standard deviation.

Results
The heads of Forbesichthys agassizii (Figure 1) and Chologaster cornuta (Figure 2,7) were
covered with stich-like structures, positioned dorsal-ventrally. The neuromasts on the dorsal and
lateral part of the head were receded into pits. The ventral side of the jaw and rostrum in both of
these species were populated with superficial neuromasts on papilla. The mandibular papillae
were situated in grooves that run from the tip of the lower jaw to the edge of the mouth. The
mean surface area of each superficial neuromast in C. cornuta was 272.9Â±45.0 Î¼m2. The sensory

plate, positioned in the center of the neuromast, was made up of about hundreds of hair cells that
occupy 131.7 Â±9.1 Î¼m2, or 48.3% of the neuromast area. The polarity, from shorter to longer, of
the stereocilia was perpendicular to the long axis of the neuromast. The length of the kinocilium
was 3.5Â±1.5 Î¼m. In F. agassizii, mean surface area was 320Â±40 Î¼m2, with hair cells occupying
121.7Â±22.9 Î¼m2, or 38% of the area of the sensory plate. The length of the kinocilium was 3.0Â±
1.5 Î¼m. Each organ was raised above the skin on a fleshy papilla approximately 0.5 mm high.
All cupulae were removed during processing.
Both species of cavefishes examined (Typhlichthys subterraneus and Amblyopsis spelaea)
had more stiches than the two surface fishes (surface fishes= 18Â±3 vs cavefish= 25Â±6; Figure 4
and 5). The stiches were also longer in the dorsal-ventral dimension in T. subterraneus. All
neuromasts in cavefishes had hair cells on papillae (height of papillla: A. spelaea = 0.55Â±0.006
mm; T. subterraneus 0.73Â±0.16 mm; Figure 6,7). In A. spelaea, neuromasts had a surface area of
759.1Â±133 Î¼m2. The sensory plate of the neuromast had a mean area of 210.8Â±27.0 Î¼m2, or 27%
of the surface area of the neuromast. The kinocilium was 7.0Â±1.1 Î¼m, and we were able to
measure the cupula at 30.0Â± 6Î¼m. In T. subterraneus, mean neuromast surface area resembled
surface fishes at 224Â±59.7 Î¼m2. The sensory plate area was 56.8Â±18.0 Î¼m2, occupying 25% of
the surface area of the neuromast. The length of the kinocilium was 5.4Â±0.9 Î¼m.
Amblyopsis spelaea had significantly larger neuromast areas than all other amblyopsids
(HSD: P<0.01; Figure 8). There was no difference among T. subterraneus, F. agassizii and C.
cornuta (ANOVA: P<0.0001, F=70.34, df =28). Sensory plate areas were not significantly
different between the two surface fishes, but were both larger than T. subterraneous (HSD:
P<0.01), and smaller than A. spelaea (HSD: P<0.01). Accordingly, A. spelaea had a larger
sensory plate area than T. subterraneus (HSD: P<0.01: ANOVA: P<0.0001, F=62.53, df=28). A.

spelaea had longer kinocilium than all other fishes (HSD: P<0.01). Typhlichthys subterraneus
had longer kinocilium than both F. agassizii and C. cornuta (HSD: P<0.01), which were similar
in length (ANOVA: P<0.0001, F= 108.95, df= 131). Hair cells in the sensory plate of cavefishes
also appear thicker than surface fishes.

Discussion
The successful colonization of the subterranean environment often is accompanied by the loss of
vision. As eyes become less useful for detecting the environment, other sensory modalities such
as mechanosensation become more prominent and even hypertrophied (Marshall 1965, 1971).
All four amblyopsid fishes included in this study had extensive cephalic superficial lateral line
systems. Two types of cephalic superficial neuromasts were present in amblyopsids: one receded
into pits into the skin and one on top of papillae. This difference perhaps represents different
biological strategies or the result of different environmental adaptations. Both types of
superficial neuromasts are arranged in dorsal-ventral stiches on the head. As most of these sets of
neuromasts are also arranged with best sensitivity perpendicular to the row, they give the whole
lateral line a bias for detecting water movements in the rostral-caudal direction. There were no
canal neuromasts seen on the heads of all amblyopsids. In general, proliferation of superficial
neuromasts in surface-dwelling fishes is accompanied by the loss of canals (More and Burris
1956; Webb 1989).
The difference is position of cephalic superficial neuromasts between primarily surface and
cave-obligate amblyopsids, i.e., receded in pits versus positioned on top of papillae, may reflect
differences in microhabitat use. Both Chologaster and Forbesichthys are nocturnal benthic
predators that seek shelter during the daytime and exhibit strong thigmotaxis (Weise 1957; Smith

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/701490; this version posted July 14, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

and Welch 1958; Niemiller and Poulson 2010). Chologaster typically occurs in heavily
vegetated and shaded swamps and backwater habitats where they can be collected in dense
vegetation, leaf litter, and other organic debris (Cooper and Rohde, 1980; Ross and Rohde, 2003)
and are rarely found in flowing water (Poulson 1960). Likewise, Forbesichthys typically are
found in dense vegetation, under rocks, or seek shelter underground deep in springs and caves
(Weise 1957; Smith and Welch 1958; Niemiller and Poulson 2010). The recession of superficial
neuromasts into pits may be an adaptation for living among dense vegetation, organic debris, and
other cover in these two species, which could be damaged if exposed and extended from the
body surface on papillae.
The difference in position of the neuromasts in the skin in relation to the water is likely to
have a functional significance. The water flow that is detected by the superficial neuromasts is
filtered by the hydrodynamics of the body surface of the fish (McHenry et al. 2008). The
viscosity of water causes flow close to surface to move slower creating a spatial gradient known
as the boundary layer (Lamb 1945; Schlichting 1979). The boundary layer over the surface of the
body of the fish behaves as a high-pass filter that attenuates low-frequency stimuli (Kuiper 1967;
Hassan 1985; Kalmijn 1988; Teyke 1988; McHenry et al. 2008). High frequency stimuli, such as
that created by swimming prey or conspecifics, would become more salient to the fish. The
boundary layer over the surface of the body of a fish plays a major role in determining the
signals detected by superficial neuromasts (Batchelor 1967; Schlichting 1979; McHenry et al.
2008).
The boundary layer of swimming fish was studied in Astyanax, and it decreases with velocity
so that, it is 5 mm thick at 11 cm/sec, and 1 mm at 150 cm/sec (Teyke 1988). Astyanax is
comparable in body size to amblyopsids, and, although there are no measurements of swimming

speed of amblyopsid cavefishes, the height of the papilla (A. spelaea = 0.55Â±0.006 mm; T.
subterraneus 0.73Â±0.16 mm) suggests that the neuromasts likely do not escape the boundary
layer. The attraction to live prey using the lateral line has been examined by Yoshizawa et al
(2010) also in Astyanax. In these fish, the vibration attraction behavior is tuned to 35Hz, which is
considered a high frequency and could denote a moving prey item. This behavior is abolished if
the superficial neuromasts are ablated, specifically in the cephalic area.
The proliferation of superficial neuromasts is an adaptation for life not only in subterranean
environments, but also in the deep sea, and other low-flow habitats (Denton and Grey 1988,
1989; Coombs et al. 1988, 1992; Northcutt 1989; Marshall 1996; Poulson 2001). Deep-sea fishes
are an interesting case because their visual world is very different than that of cavefishes. At
depth, bioluminescence point sources dominate as visual stimuli, and eyes, although often
referred to as `regressedâ or `degenerateâ are actually quite well suited at this type of stimulus
(Douglas et al. 1998; Warrant 2000; Warrant and Locket 2004). Nonetheless, it appears that
deep-sea fishes rely heavily on their lateral line to detect the environment and prey, (Marshall
1996, Johnson et al. 2009). Both cavefishes and deep-sea fishes do not display schooling
behaviors, which require lateral line input (Cahn et al. 1968; Greenwood et al. 2013; Kowalko et
al. 2013). Another group with significant cephalic surface neuromasts are gobies (Marshall 1986;
Webb 1989), and in these fishes, many of the stiches are also vertically oriented (More and
Burris 1956), biasing the detection of environmental disturbances in the rostral-caudal
dimension.
Although we were not able to measure the cupula of the surface species, both cavefishes had
a relatively short cupulae, roughly 30 Î¼m in length. The range of lengths of the cupula in surface
fishes is variable dependent on the species and ranges between 20 Î¼m and 500 Î¼m, (Mukai and

Kobayashi 1993). The cupulae of Astyanax are primarily 100 Î¼m in length but some are as long
as 300 Î¼m (Teyke 1990). The longer cupulae in Astyanax therefore can increase lateral line
sensitivity by protruding into the boundary layer. Astyanax and amblyopsid cavefishes appear to
have different strategies to increase the height in which the cupula interacts with the water.
Chologaster and Forbesichthys were not different from each other, but cavefishes (A. spelaea
and T. subterraneus) appear to encode hydrodynamic information to a different extent.
Amblyopsis spelaea has the most extreme cephalic superficial neuromast phenotype.
Our study support the general rule that mechanosensation becomes hypertrophied during
cave adaptation of fishes. However, our study also suggests that hypertrophy can be variable and
possibly dependent on microhabitat, developmental constraints and/or phylogeny.

Figure 8. A. spelaea has the largest superficial cephalic neuromasts of all fishes (A), with the
largest sensory plate area (B) and the longest kinocilium (C). Both surface fishes sensory plate
areas (B) and kinocelium lengths are similar to each other (C). Both cavefishes are not
significantly different from each other but different from both cavefishes.
