Abstract

21

The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) is an emerging and most severe

22

pest species in the Old World. It is originally native in the Americas. Since 2016 it has

23

spread widely and rapidly to throughout Africa, the Middle East, India, Southeast Asia and

24

most recently southern China. By May 2019 it has appeared in 13 provinces in most

25

southern China and would spread further to northern China. It is highly likely that S.

26

frugiperda would enter into Japan and Korea via overseas migrations as many other

27

migratory pests did before. To evaluate the invasion risk of S. frugiperda into Japan and

28

Korean Peninsula, we modelled the rate of expansion and future potential migratory range

29

of the insect by a trajectory analytical approach with flight behaviour of S. frugiperda

30

implemented, and meteorological data of past five years (2014–2018) used. Our results

31

predicted that S. frugiperda would migrate from southern and eastern China into Japan

32

and Korea soon. Most likely, Japan would be invaded from Fujian and Zhejiang on 1 June

33

– 15 July, and Kyushu, Shikoku and south-western Honshu could face the highest risk of S.

34

frugiperda’s invasion. Korea would be most possibly reached by S. frugiperda from

35

northern Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong on 1 June – 15 July and later. Our

36

results indicated a very high risk that S. frugiperda would annually invade Japan and the

37

Korean Peninsula and cause a possible significant decrease in agricultural productivity.

1 INTRODUCTION

41

The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) is an emerging and most severe

42

pest species in the Old World. It is an omnivorous pest native to the tropical and

43

subtropical regions of the Americas (Luginbill,1928; Sparks,1979). S. frugiperda has the

44

characteristics of strong migration ability, high reproduction, gluttony, and difficulty in

45

prevention and control (Johnson, 1987; Early, Gonzalez-Moreno, Murphy & Day, 2018;

46

Jiang, Luo, Zhang, Sappington & Hu, 2019). Its host range is extensively wide, including

47

corn, rice, wheat, and more than 180 kinds of other crops, vegetables, ornamental plants,

48

fruits (Casmuz et al., 2010). This insect was known as a super pest of the UN Food and

49

Agriculture Organization Global Alert (FAO, 2018).

50

With the rapid expansion of international trade, S. frugiperda first invaded Nigeria and

51

Ghana in Africa in 2016 (Goergen et al., 2016; Cock et al., 2017). In the following two

52

years, it swept through 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Nagoshi et al., 2018;

53

Rwomushana et al., 2018), caused heavy losses to African food production (Stokstad &

54

Erik, 2017). In May 2018, S. frugiperda was first found in India (Sharanabasappa et al.,

55

2018), then spread rapidly to other Asian countries including Thailand, Sri Lanka,

56

Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and China (Guo, Zhao, He, Zhang & Wang, 2018;

57

Wu, Jiang & Wu, 2019a; NATESC, 2019ab). On 11 January, 2019, the first confirmation of

58

the invasion of S. frugiperda was made in Yunnan Province, China (Jiang & Zhu, 2019;

59

NATESC, 2019a). By May 2019, S. frugiperda has spread in most province in southern

60

China, including Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, Hunan, Hainan, Fujian,

61

Zhejiang, Hubei, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Chongqing, and Henan provinces (NATESC, 2019c).

62

Its long-distance migration will significantly increase the risk of spread. According to the

63

forecast results, by July 2019, it is highly possible that S. frugiperda would reach the main

64

corn-producing areas of in North China and Northeast China (Wu & Wu, 2019; Li et

65

al.,2019).

66

The Japanese Islands and the Korean Peninsula as well as eastern China belong to

67

the East Asian migration arena. Their geographical location, ecological environment, and

68

climatic conditions are closely connected each other. Many seasonal pests, such as rice

69

planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens, Sogatella furcifera and Laodelphax striatellus) and the

70

oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata, can migrate from China to the Japanese Islands

71

and the Korean Peninsula by flying overseas (Otuka, 2013, 2015; Kisimoto & Sogawa,

72

1995; Hirai, 1995; Lee & Uhm, 1995). The population size of migratory pests in source

73

areas can be directly predict their occurrence level in destination areas (Watanabe, Seino,

74

Kitamura, Hirai, 1990). Now that S. frugiperda has arrived in Southeast Asia and southern

75

China, there is a high possibility that they would invade Japan and Korea soon. The

76

invasion of S. frugiperda has seriously threatened the production of local corn and other

77

crops and food security. Thus, it is urgent to predict an invasion risk of S. frugiperda into

78

Japan and Korea.

79

To estimate a first-invasion risk of S. frugiperda into Japan and Korea, this study

80

conducted a three-dimensional trajectory analysis for recent five years, 2014-2018. We

81

simulated migration paths of S. frugiperda to provide the probability of their arrivals. This

82

study presents a scientific basis for monitoring and early warning of S. frugiperda in Japan

83

and Korea.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

85

We estimated potential endpoints of S. frugiperda migrations by calculating forward

86

flight trajectories from source areas where S. frugiperda are currently, as of May 2019,

87

known to be breeding, or from potential future source areas we predicted they would

88

reproduce shortly in our previous study (Li et al., 2019). A numerical trajectory model was

89

developed and used successfully for S. frugiperda and many other insect migrants, such

90

as the corn earworm Helicoverpa zea, M. separata, and the rice leaf roller Cnaphalocrocis

91

medinalis (Li et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2017). This method takes account

92

of flight behaviour and self-powered flight vectors, as these are known to alter trajectory

93

pathways

trajectory calculation. In this study, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction

100

(NCEP) Final Analysis (FNL) data were 6-hourly, global, 1-degree grid meteorological data

101

that was used as initial field data and boundary conditions for WRF. The hourly initial and

102

boundary conditions were simulated by WRF to run the three-dimensional trajectory

103

program for S. frugiperda, which had a spatial resolution of 30 km. Calculation schemes

104

and parameters for WRF modelling are listed in Table 1.

2.3 Trajectory modelling of S. frugiperda

106

Based on biological characteristics of the migration of S. frugiperda, trajectories were

107

calculated with following parameters. (i) S. frugiperda flies downwind at high altitude (Wolf,

108

Westbrook, Raulston & Lingren,1995; Nagoshi, Meagher, Fleischer, 2009), without

109

considering a directional deflection angle (Li et al.,2019). (ii) A self-powered flight vector of

110

3.0 m/s was added to wind speed in the trajectory modelling (Westbrook et al.,2007; Li et

111

al.,2019). (iii) The noctuid insects fly at night, taking off at dusk, and landing at dawn on the

112

next day (Qi et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017). According to the sunrise and sunset times at

113

departure points from April to August, take-off time is 20:00 h (CST), landing time is 06:00

114

h (CST) on the next day; thus S. frugiperda flies continuously for 10 h every night, and flies

115

for three consecutive nights as most other noctuid moths, when the moth flies over lands

116

(Wang et al., 2017). (iv) When S. frugiperda comes over the sea area, East China Sea and

117

Yellow Sea, during each nocturnal flight, flight duration is extended until it reaches over the

118

land, but does not exceed 36 hours; (v) Because S. frugiperda cannot fly when air

119

temperature at flight altitude becomes below 13.8 °C, trajectories that enters into the low

120

temperature zones were stopped on any night/height combination (Hogg, Pitre &

121

Anderson, 1982). (vi) Radar observations show that moth insects usually fly in a low-level

122

jet stream at altitudes with wind speed > 10 m/s (Johnson, 1987; Wolf et al., 1990;

123

Westbrook, Nagoshi, Meagher, Fleischer & Jairam, 2016). In this study, using six different

124

initial heights: 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, and 1750 m above mean sea level (Li et al.,

125

2019), and thus six trajectories were calculated on one night at one departure point.

126

We simulated the trajectories of S. frugiperda by using meteorological conditions at

127

flight altitude from the past 5 years (2014–2018). In total, ~0.14 million trajectories were

128

calculated, making this the largest study of S. frugiperda migration pathways conducted.

129
130

2.3 Departure points for forward trajectories

131

Trajectories were started from each potential departure point placed at every

132

1-degree grid for eight southern and eastern provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi,

133

Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan. According to the prediction result of S.

134

frugiperda in eastern China (Li et al.,2019), it would spread to Guangxi and Fujian in April

135

and emigrate out one month later, and reach Jiangxi, Zhejiang, southern Anhui and

136

southern Jiangsu (south of 32°N) in May and June. At last S. frugiperda would cover the

137

entire Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan and Shandong provinces in June and July (Li et al., 2019).

138

Therefore, the eight provinces were divided into following three parts: (i) Guangdong and

139

Fujian from 1 to 31 May; (ii) Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, southern Anhui (south of 32ºN) and

140

southern Jiangsu (south of 32ºN) from 1 June to 15 July. This time period covers all the

141

dominant rain season in southern China (the Meiyu season) and Japan (the Bai-u season),

142

and most other insects migrate into Japan during this period (Otuka et al., 2010; Tojo et al.,

143

2013); (iii) Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan from16 July to 15 August.

144

2.4 Probability distribution of S. frugiperda entering Japan and Korea

145

Only trajectories of S. frugiperda that entered Japan and Korea were selected to

146

make the distribution of an immigration probability, or invasion risk. The spatial frequency

147

distribution of final endpoints of trajectories was calculated and displayed by using QGIS

148

(Version 3.6, https://www.qgis.org/) and R (Version 3.5, https://www.r-project.org/), and

149

this was achieved by the following procedures. Firstly, the Korean Peninsula and Japan

150

were divided into several hexagonal cells, and the number of endpoints located in each

151

hexagonal cell were counted in QGIS. Secondly, hexagonal cells in Japan (or in the

152

Korean Peninsula) were divided equally into four groups based on the number of

153

endpoints, (i) ≤ 25th percentile, (ii) > 25th percentile but ≤ median value, (iii) > medial value

154

but ≤ 75th percentile, and (iv) ≥ 75th percentile. Finally, these results and the spatial

155

distribution of trajectories’ origins were displayed by using R.

156

2.5 Wind pattern during migration season

157

To investigate wind pattern (wind speed and direction) in the last five years

158

(2014–2018), we plotted average meteorological conditions at 850 hPa (approximately

159

1500 m above sea level). Long-term data were extracted and calculated from the daily

160

NCEP/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis data, with a spatial

161

resolution of 2.5° by 2.5° global grids, and displayed using the Grid Analysis Display

162

System (GrADS, Version 2.0.1, http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/).

163
164

3 RESULTS

165

To estimate the invasion risk of S. frugiperda into Korean Peninsula and Japan islands,

166

138780 forward trajectories were calculated. In total, 18082 (13.03%) trajectories reached

167

one of these two regions (Fig. 2).

168

3.1 Immigration pattern on the Korean Peninsula

169

In May, 25110 trajectories (31 nights x 27 departure points x 6 initial heights x 5 years)

170

were calculated and departed from Guangdong and Fujian. Among these, 698 (2.78%)

171

trajectories arrived Korean Peninsula. Among these effective trajectories, their endpoints

172

were located in the western and southern coastal areas of South Korea (Fig. 3). The

173

straight distance between the departure and end points of each trajectory was

174

1631.76±10.88 km (mean value ± standard error, same after that). The flight duration to

175

cover this distance was 30.81±0.34 h (Fig. 4).

176

In the second period from June 1 to July 15, 63450 trajectories (45 nights x 47

177

departure points x 6 initial heights x 5 years) were calculated from Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and

178

southern Anhui (south of 32°N), south Jiangsu (south of 32°N). Among these, 7355

179

(11.59%) arrived in the Korean Peninsula. Most of these effective trajectories originated

180

from southern Jiangsu, southeastern Anhui, and northern Zhejiang (darker blue dots in Fig.

181

3). Their endpoints mostly located in the western coastal area of the peninsula (Fig. 3).

182

The straight distance of these simulated trajectories was 1214.49±3.31 km, and the flight

183

duration was 33.28±0.12 h (Fig. 4).

184

In the third period on 16 July to 15 August, 8.84% (4437/50220) trajectories originated

185

from 54 departure points in Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, and Shandong, reached the Korean

186

Peninsula (Fig. 3). The endpoints of these effective trajectories distribute in the western

187

part of North Korea and the northwestern part of South Korea. The main departure points

188

distributed in eastern Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu (Fig. 3). The straight distance of

189

these simulated trajectories was 922.80±3.68 km, and the flight duration was 30.50±0.15 h

190

(Fig. 4).

191

In summary, the results predicted that S. frugiperda would invade into the Korean

192

Peninsula, especially in the western coastal area. S. frugiperda in Anhui, Jiangsu and

193

Shandong provinces would make main contributions to this invasion in the second (1

194

June–15 July) and third periods (16 July–15 August) (Fig. 3 & 4).

195

3.2 Immigration pattern on Japan

196

The percentages of trajectories from eastern China into Japan were 4.06%

197

(1020/25110), 6.41% (4065/63450) and 1.01% (507/50220) on 1–31 May, 1 June– 15 July,

198

and 16 July–15 August, respectively (Fig. 2 & 3). This result indicated it is quite possible

199

that S. frugiperda would invade into Japan from 1 June through 15 July, and there was

200

lower attainable in the other two periods. Kyushu, Shikoku, and southwestern Honshu and

201

Shikoku would face a high risk of the invasion because most these trajectories ended over

202

this region from 1 June to 15 July (Fig. 3). S. frugiperda invader into Japan would mostly

203

come from Fujian and Zhejiang province (Fig. 2 & 3). Moreover, the Ryukyu Islands would

204

be reached by S. frugiperda originated from Guangdong and Fujian provinces in May (Fig.

205

2 & 3). By contrast, quite lots of S. frugiperda’s trajectories reached Hokkaido by crossing

206

Korean Peninsula in 16 July–15 August (Fig. 2 & 3).

207

During the three periods, 1–31 May, 1 June–15 July, and 16 July–15 August, the

208

straight flight distances of the trajectories were 1602.77±13.67 km, 1818.32±7.95km, and

209

2193.99±18.05 km, respectively (Fig. 4). The flight duration to cover these distances were

210

32.91±0.32 h, 36.81±0.17 h, and 46.40±0.34 h, respectively (Fig. 4).

211

Take the results together, Japan also has a high risk of S. frugiperda invasion,

212

especially in the second period, i.e., 1 June– 15 July. However, the possibility of the

213

invasion into Japan was relatively lower when compared with the Korean Peninsula,

214

because the overseas distance between eastern China and Japan were longer than that

215

between eastern China and Korea (Fig. 3 & 4).

3.3 Wind pattern during migration season
The wind pattern on an isobaric level of 850 hPa (about 1500 m above sea level)
during the migration season was investigated with a five-year dataset (2014–2018).

219

Southwest winds predominated in southern China and extended into Japan in May.

220

Strong south-westerly air currents (≥ 4 m/s) flowed just in the Ryukyu Islands, and this

221

indicated the lack of suitable winds to transport S. frugiperda into the mainland of Japan

222

and the Korean Peninsula (Fig. 5a). Meanwhile, Guangdong and Fujian, the source area

223

of S. frugiperda, are far from the mainland of Japan and the Korean Peninsula (Fig. 3).

224

Thus, the frequency for S. frugiperda to reach the mainland of Japan and the Korean

225

Peninsula was relatively lower in May, but the Ryukyu Islands can be reached by quite lots

226

of S. frugiperda trajectories (Fig. 3 & 5a). In contrast, S. frugiperda in eastern China could

227

spread very quickly in May due to strengthening southwesterly winds (Fig. 5a), and this

228

scenario is exactly what happened until May of this year. After colonization in Yunnan,

229

Hainan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, S. frugiperda appeared in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi,

230

Fujian, and Zhejiang in May 2019 (NATESC, 2019c).

231

During 1 June–15 July, southwesterly winds strengthened and extended over East

232

China Sea and Yellow Sea, and this would be helpful for S. frugiperda migrating from

233

eastern China into Japan and Korean Peninsula (Fig. 5b). Although the mean wind speed

234

over the Yellow Sea is quite lower (<4 m/s) (Fig. 5b), the distance between Jiangsu and

235

Korean Peninsula is not very far (Fig. 3 & 4). As a result, larger proportion of simulated

236

trajectories arrived in Japan, and Korean Peninsula than in other periods (Fig. 2 & 3).

237

The wind got weaken after 16 July. The wind direction changed to northward on the
11

238

south of the Yellow River (Fig. 5c), and thus this was not suitable for S. frugiperda

239

migrating into Japan. Eastward winds mostly appeared in northern China, Bohai Sea, and

240

northern Yellow Sea (Fig. 5c), and this would help for S. frugiperda’s oversea migration

241

into the Korean Peninsula. The wind speed was low (Fig. 5c), but the distance from

242

Shandong and Jiangsu to the Korean Peninsula is relatively short (Fig. 4). It is the season

243

that 8.84% of simulated trajectories reached the peninsula.

244
245

4 DISCUSSION

246

This study predicted the immigration risk of S. frugiperda into Japan and Korea by the

247

trajectory analysis considering the flight behaviour of S. frugiperda based on the five-year

248

meteorological data. The results showed that S. frugiperda would migrate from eastern

249

China into Japan and Korea Peninsula shortly (Fig. 3).

250

Possibility that such overseas migrations will actually occur, or validity of the predicted

251

risk in this study, depends mainly on the accuracy of assumptions made on the source

252

location and the flight behaviour in Section 2. The rapid spreading of the moth in China

253

started from southwestern Yunnan Province where the moths were firstly found in late

254

January this year, and only within 3 months since then, which corresponds to the insect’s 3

255

generations, S. frugiperda was found in 13 provinces (NATESC, 2019a, b, c), including

256

Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces that were assumed as a source in this

257

study. Because the moth’s spreading speed is very large, it is fair to predict that other

258

Regarding the flight behaviour, trajectory analysis of the species in the previous study

261

used such parameters as initial height of 500 m, flight duration of 12 h and 3-night flight for

262

migration over the land of North America (Westbrook, Nagoshi, Meagher, Fleischer &

263

Jairam, 2016). A previous trajectory analysis on the overseas migration of the common

264

cutworm, Spodoptera litura, over East China Sea assumed flight height of 1000 and 1500

265

m, flight duration of 24 or 36 h (Tojo et al. 2013). This study assumed six initial heights

266

from 500 to 1750 m, flight duration of 10 h over the land, up to 36 h in case of overseas

267

migration, and 3-night flight as described in Section 2.3. Comparing with above these

268

parameters each other, this study’s assumptions on the source and the flight behaviour

269

seem reasonable. The invasion risk of this study, therefore, should be a fair prediction.

270

First possible arrivals in Japan could happen on southwestern small islands of

271

Okinawa and Kagoshima Prefectures as well as western parts of Kyushu in May (Fig. 3b).

272

Most likely, S. frugiperda would migrate from Fujian and Zhejiang into Kyushu, Shikoku

273

and southern Honshu from 1 June – 15 July, the rainy season (Fig. 3d). During the

274

summer period from mid-July, the invasion risk in northern Japan could relatively increase

275

(Fig. 3f). As a whole, a wide area of Japan has an immigration risk.

276

First possible arrivals from Guangdong and Fujian could also occur in May in the

277

western coastal areas of the Korean Peninsula (Fig. 3a). In the later periods of 1 June – 15

278

July and 16 July – 15 August, western Korean Peninsula would be continuously reached

279

by S. frugiperda migrants from northern Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong (Fig. 3c,

280

e). According to the shift of the location of these possible sources from south to north,

281

relatively higher risk also shifted from southern, middle to northern coastal areas of the

282

peninsula (Fig. 3a, c, e).

283

These possible migrations could result in substantial damages and economic losses

284

to agricultural production in Japan and Korea unless S. frugiperda population was

285

effectively managed. Sugar cane, Saccharum officinarum is grown as a major agricultural

286

product on the southwestern small islands. In Kyushu and mountainous areas in Honshu,

287

livestock industry is active and maize, Zea mays L., for feed would a possible host plant for

288

the immigrants. Maize is a major crop in Hokkaido, northern Japan, too. In northern part of

289

the Korean Peninsula, maize is widely cultivated as one of important crops which would be

290

severely damaged by summer migrants as predicted in Northeast China (Li et al., 2019).

291

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and hog millet (Panicum miliaceum) in northern Korea would

292

be also attacked. If summer immigration would occur, plant protection officers in these

293

areas should bear that possibility in mind. There are two types of biological strain of S.

294

frugiperda, corn-strain and rice-strain (Pashley, Quisenberry & Jamjanya 1987). If the

295

rice-strain to attack rice arrived in Japan and Korea, the almost all areas would be

296

vulnerable to immigrants, because rice is cultivated everywhere in the nations. So far,

297

Chinese population caught in Yunnan Province has been reported to be the corn-strain

298

(Zhang et al., 2019).

299

Many species of insects can migrate into Japan and the Korea Peninsula by crossing

300

over the sea, such as S. litura, M. separata, and rice planthoppers (Otuka et al., 2006;

301

Otuka, 2013; Kisimoto & Sogawa, 1995; Hirai, 1995; Lee & Uhm, 1995; Tojo et al., 2013).

302

N. luges and S. furcifera generally immigrate into Japan during the Bai-u rainy season

303

from late June to early July (Kisimoto & Sogawa, 1995; Otuka et al., 2006). Kyushu and

304

southern Honshu have the highest density of these two rice planthoppers (Kisimoto, 1976).

305

The origin areas of these migrants was estimated by trajectory method to be southeastern

306

China, such as Fujian, Zhejiang and Taiwan provinces (Otuka et al., 2006). In South Korea,

307

N. luges also was reported to arrive in this same period of each year (Lee & Uhm, 1995;

308

Zhu et al., 2000). In addition, S. litura is the same genus as S. frugiperda, and many male

309

moths were caught by pheromone traps in Japan from June to middle July, and these

310

moths were also thought to migrate from southern China (Tojo et al., 2013). Here, our

311

study also suggested S. frugiperda would most likely carry out overseas migration into

312

Japan and South Korea via similar pathway at similar time period (Fig. 2). The season of

313

all those insect species migrating into Japan and South Korea at same time is that warm

314

and humid southwesterly winds was quite frequent during the Bai-u season. This kind of

315

wind always associated with the passage of depressions along the frontal zone, and the

316

speed can up to 10 m/s or more (Kisimoto, 1976; Watanabe, Seino, Kitamura, Hirai, 1990;

317

also see Fig. 4).

318

Conversely, the migration pathway and timing of L. striatellus and M. separata are

319

different with those aforementioned species. A single-flight migration route of M. separata

320

invaded into Korea and northern Japan mainly in late May – early June is suggested in

321

previous studies (Haria, 1995; Lee & Uhm, 1995). The moths might originate in eastern

322

China at 30–36°N (probably from Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan and Shandong) (Jiang et al.,

323

2011), crossing over the northern Yellow Sea, passing beyond the Korean Peninsula at

324

37–38°N, and arriving in northern Japan at 39–45°N (Hirai, 1995; Lee & Uhm, 1995).

325

Similarly, L. striatellus from Jiangsu migrating into western Japan and western South
15

326

Korea was also reported by crossing over the Yellow Sea in late May and early June

327

(Otuka, 2013). Immigrations of both these species occurs most frequently on strong

328

southwesterly or westerly winds, also associated with the passage of a low pressure

329

system (Haria, 1995; Lee & Uhm, 1995; Otuka, 2013). S. frugiperda would likely have

330

similar migration route but at different timing, in 16 July–15 August. This is presumably

331

because S. frugiperda appeared in Jiangsu, Anhui and Shandong later than the former two

332

species. L. striatellus can survive cold winter in most area of eastern China, even in the

333

Northeast Plain (Sun et al., 2015), and the population in Jiangsu emigrates when wheat

334

matures and was harvested in late May (Otuka, 2013). M. separata overwinters in a region

335

south of the Yangtze River (< 33 ºN) in China (Sun, 1990), and reach the region of

336

30–34°N in March and April (Chen, 1995; Jiang et al., 2011). However, the year-round

337

distribution of S. frugiperda, which does not possess a capability to enter diapause

338

(Westbrook et al., 2016), in East Asia is restricted to relatively warm and moist regions

339

found on the Indochina Peninsula and in southern China (to the south of the Tropic of

340

Cancer) (Early et al., 2018), and thus it would arrive in Jiangsu and Shandong later.

341

In conclusion, Japan and Korea face a high risk of invasion of S. frugiperda mainly in 1

342

June–15 July, the Bai-u rainy season. This migration pattern was also used by many other

343

migratory insects. S. frugiperda in eastern China actually spread very quickly in May

344

(NASTEC 2019c), and this coincided precisely with the predictive range from our previous

345

study with the same approach (Li et al., 2019). Therefore, the continuing spread through

346

China to Japan and Korea seems inevitable. Additional studies on its migration patterns,

347

flight behaviour, ecology, and pest management based on monitoring data in East Asia are
