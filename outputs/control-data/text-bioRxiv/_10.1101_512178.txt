Abstract

23

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that severely impacts global

24

food security and is one of the greatest constraints on international trade of animal products.

25

Extensive viral population diversity and rapid, continuous mutation of circulating FMD viruses

26

(FMDVs) pose significant obstacles to the control and ultimate eradication of this important

27

transboundary pathogen. The current study investigated mechanisms contributing to within-host

28

evolution of FMDV in a natural host species (cattle). Specifically, vaccinated and non-

29

vaccinated cattle were infected with FMDV under controlled, experimental conditions and

30

subsequently sampled for up to 35 days to monitor viral genomic changes as related to phases of

31

disease and experimental cohorts. Consensus-level genomic changes across the entire FMDV

32

coding region were characterized through three previously defined stages of infection: early,

33

transitional, and persistent. The overall conclusion was that viral evolution occurred via a

34

combination of two mechanisms: emergence of full-genomic minority haplotypes from within

35

the inoculum super-swarm, and concurrent continuous point mutations. Phylogenetic analysis

36

indicated that individuals were infected with multiple distinct haplogroups that were pre-existent

37

within the ancestral inoculum used to infect all animals. Multiple shifts of dominant viral

38

haplotype took place during the early and transitional phases of infection, whereas few shifts

39

occurred during persistent infection. These insights into FMDV population dynamics have

40

important implications for virus sampling methodology and molecular epidemiology.

Introduction
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects wild and

46

domestic even-toed ruminants [1, 2]. FMD is a major global concern for livestock owners and

47

managers, and the disease has substantial impact on regulation of international trade in animal

48

products [3]. The classical signs of disease include oral and pedal vesicles and erosions, often

49

associated with lameness, pyrexia, and obtundation [2, 4]. The causative agent, FMD virus

50

(FMDV) is extremely contagious and disseminates rapidly amongst susceptible animals.

51

Although the disease is rarely fatal, FMD-endemic regions incur substantial economic burdens

52

associated with production losses and disease control [5]. Sporadic outbreaks in countries that

53

are normally free from FMD result in costly mediations including culling of large numbers of

54

animals and animal movement restrictions, as well as massive economic losses due to

55

implications on trade in animal products.

56

FMDV (family: Picornaviridae, genus: Aphthovirus) is a single-stranded RNA virus which

57

exists in 7 defined serotypes; O, A, C, Asia-1, and Southern African Territories (SAT) 1-3. The

58

FMDV genome encodes a total of 12 mature proteins translated from a single polyprotein coding

59

region approximately 7 kilobases in length. The structural proteins VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4

60

compose the capsid, with all but VP4 serving as major antigenic targets and taking part in

61

receptor-mediated host cell entry [4, 6]. Positive selection has been identified predominantly

62

within the capsid-encoding segments, leading to elevated amino acid replacement rates [7-9].

63

Existing population diversity and rapid, continuous mutation of circulating FMD viruses pose

64

significant obstacles to its control and ultimate eradication. FMDV and other picornaviruses have

65

some of the highest mutation rates measured, at approximately one mutation per genome per

66

replication cycle (~7.8 X 10-4 nucleotides per copy) due to a low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA

67

polymerase [10-12]. Although estimates vary between studies and serotypes, FMDV nucleotide

68

substitution rates are generally found to be higher within-host than between-host (transmission

69

chains) [8, 13-15]. Furthermore, the within-host diversity of picornavirus populations has been

70

shown to directly correlate with pathogenicity [16, 17]. The role of viral quasispecies swarms in

71

the evolution of FMDV has been thoroughly described in tissue culture-based studies[18];

72

however, few studies have investigated this phenomenon in vivo in natural hosts[19-21].

73

In cattle infected with FMDV, the initial site of viral replication has been localized to focal

74

regions of epithelium within the nasopharyngeal mucosa [22, 23]. The acute phase of disease

75

lasts approximately one week, however, a substantial proportion of infected cattle become

76

subclinical long-term carriers of the virus [24-26]. In carrier cattle, virus replication is restricted

77

to epithelial cells of the nasopharynx [27-29]. The role of these animals in transmission of

78

FMDV is controversial. However, the occurrence of FMDV carriers, particularly amongst

79

vaccinated animals, has important ramifications concerning international trade and outbreak

80

response measures [30, 31]. The FMDV carrier state has conventionally been defined by the

81

presence of infectious virus in oropharyngeal fluids (OPF) >28 days past initial infection [32].

82

However, recent investigations have demonstrated that animals that clear infection can be

83

differentiated from those that become carriers as early as 10 days post infection (dpi) for

84

vaccinated and 21 dpi for non-vaccinated cattle [28, 33]. These findings have led to the

85

definition of the transitional phase of FMDV infection, which corresponds to the temporal

86

window during which FMDV is cleared from cattle that do not become carriers [28]. Transitional

87

phase events thus comprise a critical stage of FMDV pathogenesis wherein pivotal virus-host

88

interactions determine the outcome of the FMDV carrier state divergence [28, 34].

89

Detailed analysis of longitudinal virus samples obtained from individual hosts has increased

90

understanding of antigenicity and important microevolutionary processes in RNA viruses such as

91

hepatitis C virus and influenza virus [35-37]. A vivid example of the importance of events that

92

take place during chronic infection is the case of poliovirus wherein the Sabin vaccine strain

93

evolved pathogenicity in a patient over time [38, 39]. Recent publications examining the full-

94

length FMDV genome have begun to elucidate the complexities of viral population dynamics

95

and behavior through transmission events and within hosts [19, 21, 40, 41]. A detailed

96

understanding of how FMDV changes over time both within hosts and through chains of

97

transmission is key to understanding its pathogenesis and epidemiology.

98

The central aim of this study was to characterize changes that take place within the FMDV

99

coding region across all stages of infection in vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle. The duration

100

and longitudinal nature of this study enabled novel characterizations of emergent FMDV variants

101

as related to disease stage, vaccination status, and haplotypic linkage.

102

Methods

103

Experimental design

104

This investigation was based on samples collected from cattle included in a large-scale

105

investigation of the FMDV carrier state, carried out at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center,

106

New York. All procedures involving animals were carried out in accordance with the

107

experimental protocol (protocol 209-15-R) that had been approved by the Plum Island Animal

108

Disease Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Details of the animal experiments

109

and sample collection have been described in previous publications [22, 28, 42]. In brief, both

110

vaccinated (with a recombinant adenovirus-vectored FMDV serotype A vaccine [43]) and non5

111

vaccinated cattle were infected with FMDV-A24 Cruzeiro through intra-nasopharyngeal

112

inoculation [44] and monitored for up to 35 days post infection (dpi). All animals were subjected

113

to daily clinical examinations, and analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs (flunixinmeglumine,

114

1.1–2.2mg/kg; butorphanol tartrate, 0.1 mg/kg) were administered if needed to mitigate pain

115

associated with severe foot-and-mouth disease. Animals were euthanized for tissue harvest at

116

pre-determined time points throughout the study by intravenous injection of sodiumpentobarbital

117

(86 mg/kg).

118

Three distinct periods were used to define the progression of infection in individual animals:

119

early, transitional, and persistent periods, which have different temporal boundaries in non-

120

vaccinated and vaccinated animals. In non-vaccinated cattle, the early phase (1-9 dpi)

121

corresponds to the clinical phase of disease with viremia and systemic generalization of

122

infection. These animals recover from clinical disease and either clear infection completely

123

during the subsequent transitional phase (10-21 dpi) or maintain a subclinical infection of the

124

nasopharynx through the persistent phase (>21 dpi). All vaccinated cattle included in this

125

investigation were protected against clinical FMD and systemic infection. For vaccinated cattle,

126

the early phase of infection comprised primary infection of the nasopharyngeal mucosa, and

127

associated shedding of low quantities of virus in oral and nasal secretions. Similar to non-

128

vaccinated animals, a subset of the vaccinated cattle cleared infection during the transitional

129

phase, which in this cohort was defined as 7-14 dpi, based on distinct infection dynamics

130

compared to non-vaccinated animals [28]. For both vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle, the

131

persistent phase of infection (>15 dpi and >21 dpi, respectively) consisted of subclinical

132

persistence of infectious FMDV in the nasopharyngeal mucosa.

133

Virus inoculum

134

The virus inoculum used to infect cattle in the current investigation was generated from a field-

135

derived strain of FMDV A24 Cruzeiro, which was grown in BHK-21 cells (ATCC, Manassas,

136

VA) and subsequently passaged twice in cattle. In passage 1, two cattle were inoculated through

137

intra-epithelial injection in the tongue. At 48 hours post inoculation, vesicular lesions harvested

138

from the tongue and feet of the infected cattle were used to generate a pooled virus suspension.

139

This suspension was used to infect a second cohort of three cattle through tongue inoculation. At

140

48 hours post inoculation, a second pooled virus suspension was generated from tongue and foot

141

vesicles of this second cohort. This second passage suspension was aliquoted and stored at -

142

70oC. All cattle included in the current investigation were inoculated with 105 BTID50 (50%

143

infectious doses titrated in bovine tongue epithelium) of the second passage virus.

144

Samples

145

Samples collected primarily to monitor disease progression included oral and nasal swabs, serum

146

and OPF (sampled using a probang cup [45]). Additionally, tissue distribution of virus was

147

investigated in samples obtained at necropsy examinations which were performed at

148

predetermined experimental endpoints, regardless of disease progression. All samples were

149

screened for the presence of FMDV genomic RNA and infectious virus. The detailed approach

150

and outcome of these investigations have been previously published [22, 28, 42].

151

For the current investigation, fifty-two specimens from 13 cattle were selected for FMDV

152

sequencing and analysis (S1 Fig). These samples were selected based upon positive isolation of

153

FMDV and included samples from early, transitional, and persistent phases of infection from

154

both vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle. This sample set included 41 samples from live

155

animals and 11 postmortem tissue samples. Tissue samples collected postmortem were either

156

vesicular lesions (Ves) or nasopharyngeal mucosa (Np).

157

Virus sample processing and sequencing

158

Each sample was singly passaged in LFBK-αvβ6 cells in order to ensure sufficient virus for

159

subsequent steps. Thirty-two samples were sequenced using a sequence-independent single

160

primer amplification method using the Illumina MiSeq platform as previously described [46]. An

161

additional twenty samples as well as the inoculum were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500.

162

For the NextSeq-sequenced samples, genomic FMDV RNA was extracted using the MagMAX

163

RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the KingFisher particle processor. Three

164

overlapping amplicons were reverse-transcribed (SuperScript III, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and

165

synthesized from genomic RNA using primer pairs TGGTGACAGGCTAAGGATG /

166

GCCCRGGGTTGGACTC (5’-UTR – 2A), AGTGTACAACGGGACGAGTAAGTAT /

167

TTGCTCTCTCAATGTACTCACTCAC (VP1 – 3A), and TGGCAATGTTTCAGTACGACT /

168

CGCGCCTCAGAAACAGT (2C – 3’-UTR). Amplicons were quantified using the Qubit 2.0

169

fluorometer / RNA BR/HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and normalized accordingly.

170

Libraries were constructed with the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (FC-131-1096, Illumina,

171

San Diego, California, USA). All reads were finished using CLC Genomics Workbench v. 9.5

172

(www.qiagenbioinformatics.com), including primer removal and quality-trimming. All reads

173

were mapped to the FMDV-A24 Cruzeiro reference genome. The sequence-independent

174

amplification method (32 samples) provided relatively low coverage in regions, thus a minimum

175

coverage was set at 10 reads for base calling across all samples, including the targeted amplicon

176

sequenced samples. For this reason, virus consensus sequences only (no subconsensus data) were

177

analyzed from the experimental animal samples. The inoculum was the only material for which

178

deep sequencing data was utilized.

179

Sequence analysis: alignment, statistics, variation

180

Alignments and pairwise distances were determined in MEGA 7.0 [47] and Geneious 7.1

181

(www.geneious.com [48]). Substitutions (nucleotide differences) were tabulated for each

182

sampled virus consensus sequence as compared to that of the inoculum consensus. Step-wise

183

rates were also calculated by counting substitutions between successive samples divided by the

184

time elapsed between samples. Step-wise rates were averaged across groupings according to

185

vaccination status and phase of infection. For instances in which there were multiple samples

186

from the same animal on the same date (differing only by sample type), total substitutions were

187

averaged solely for rate comparisons. The CLC Genomics Workbench low frequency variant

188

tool was used to determine site variation present in the inoculum at or above 2% with 0.75

189

strand-bias filter from 10.4 million reads mapped to its own consensus (200k average and 73k

190

minimum coverage across the protein coding region).

191

Phylogenetic analysis

192

The phylogenetic relationship between consensus viruses was modeled using PhyML 2.2

193

software (www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml, [49]). An inoculum-rooted maximum likelihood tree

194

was constructed from 2000 sampled trees with the parameters: consensus threshold 0.5; model

197

Homology modeling of the inoculum was performed using PDB: 1FOD template with Prime

198

Homology modeling module of Schrödinger Maestro v.11[50]. Residues were mutated using

199

Maestro workspace and structures were minimized with Prime using the VSGB solvation model.

200

Protein structures were rendered using Schrödinger Maestro, PyMOL and APBS plugin for

201

surface electrostatics. Antigenic sites (A-1 to A-5) were defined as described in Fry et al., 2005

202

[51].

Results

Clinical studies

208

This study was based upon analyses of virus samples harvested from animals that were part of a

209

large-scale experimental investigation of the FMDV carrier state divergence in cattle. The

210

clinical outcomes of the experiments, including monitoring of infection in live animals and

211

determination of the tissue distribution of virus through defined phases of infection, have been

212

previously published [22, 28]. In brief, vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle were infected with

213

FMDV strain A24 Cruzeiro through simulated-natural inoculation and were monitored through

214

35 days. All vaccinated cattle were protected from clinical FMD, whereas all non-vaccinated

215

cattle developed generalized FMD within 3-5 dpi. Vaccinated cattle were all subclinically

216

infected, and the occurrence and characteristics of persistent FMDV infection were similar

217

between vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohorts.

218

Variation present in the inoculum

219

In order to approximate the diversity of FMDV circulating in an outbreak, the A24 Cruzeiro

220

virus inoculum used to experimentally infect all animals in these experiments was composed of

221

pooled virus acquired from vesicles from three cattle inoculated with the same ancestral strain

222

(described in methods). The heterogeneity of the inoculum was investigated with ultra-deep

223

sequencing of the full genomic coding region. Across 10.4 million mapped reads, the variant

224

analysis identified 33 minority nucleotide variants present between 2.1 and 48.9%, distributed at

225

unique sites across the protein coding region in all but the smallest genes, 2A and 3B (Fig 1).

226

Limitations of sequencing methodologies (e.g. inconsistencies in coverage) dictated that

227

consensus-level investigation of virus samples would be the most appropriate level at which to

228

analyze genetic data. In total, 20 (60.6%) of inoculum subconsensus variants subsequently

229

emerged as the majority (consensus) in viral isolates from animal samples within this study.

230

Based upon phylogenetic relationships of the consensus sequences from animals’ samples and

231

synchronous nucleotide changes (detailed below), distinct clades were inferred within the

232

inoculum. The clade-characteristic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present within the

233

subconsensus variation of this complex inoculum were considered to have greater diversity than

234

could be attributed to a conventional quasispecies swarm. On this basis, the heterogeneous

235

inoculum is described herein as a super-swarm in order to illustrate the constituent complexity

236

derived from several individual swarms (Fig 1).

hosts that provided sequences with these variants of the 13 total. If no value is indicated (-), no

242

sample sequence encoded the minority nucleotide at the consensus level. The presence of each

243

specific site change in at least one clade member (see phylogeny, Fig 4) are indicated by

244

associated colors.

245

Gene-specific comparisons of nucleotide substitutions

246

Consensus-level nucleotide changes were characterized in 52 virus samples obtained from 13

247

experimentally infected cattle (7 non-vaccinated and 6 vaccinated), through the experimental

248

period which lasted up to 35 days. A subset of animals was euthanized for harvest of tissue

249

samples at pre-determined time points during early and transitional phases of infection and

250

therefore did not contribute to the investigation of persistent phase viruses. Samples included in

251

the analysis were nasal fluid, saliva, oropharyngeal fluid (OPF), serum, vesicle epithelium, and

252

nasopharyngeal tissue samples. Comparing the 52 consensus-level virus sequences to the

253

parental inoculum consensus sequence revealed 545 total nucleotide changes distributed across

254

168 sites, with at least one substitution in each viral protein’s coding sequence (Table 1). The

255

coding sequences for capsid proteins VP3 and VP1 had the highest proportions of substituted

256

sites at 3.8 and 3.5%, respectively (Table 1). Additionally, VP3 and VP1 contained the highest

257

numbers of nonsynonymous changes and each coding segment contained two codons with

258

nonsynonymous changes at different codon positions. Multiple amino acid substitutions were

259

found in coding segments of capsid genes of all serially sampled animals. The lowest proportion

260

of nucleotide change occurred in VP4 (0.4%) and 3D (1.6%).

Each site encoding a different nucleotide from the inoculum consensus was tallied. Total Subs is

Sequence alignment

268

The consensus virus sequences obtained within the first five days of infection (acute phase) were

269

highly similar to the inoculum consensus. Substitutions in these early phase samples were largely

270

shared across multiple animals and all of those shared substitutions were present at frequencies

271

greater than 5% in the inoculum (Fig 1). For example, inoculum subconsensus variants T1617C

272

and G1903A were each identified at consensus level in the earliest samples in 4 different

273

animals, whereas variants A1755T, C1767T, and C2615T were each present in the earliest

274

consensus viruses from 11 of the 13 total hosts (S1 Fig). At later stages of disease, most new

275

consensus-level changes present in samples were not among those detected at subconsensus level

276

in the inoculum (>2%) (Fig 1 and S1 Fig). The general trend across sample consensuses was an

277

increased divergence from the inoculum over time; however, this did not occur consistently in all

278

animals (Fig 2a and S1 Fig).

Nucleotide substitutions over time

285

Quantitation of consensus-level nucleotide changes within each animal during infection as

286

compared with the inoculum consensus indicated a variable, but overall positive slope of

287

sequence change over time (Fig 2a). However, reversions (down-turning curves) were common

288

and occurred at least once in four of the seven serially-sampled animals. In order to account for

289

potential bottleneck events and adjust for elapsed time between samplings, nucleotide changes

290

from sample to sample over elapsed time were also plotted (Fig 2b). While the sequences almost

291

always differed at multiple sites between sampling dates, the rates of change were relatively

292

stable in vaccinated hosts over time as compared to non-vaccinated. Averaged substitution rates

293

from sequential samples within the distinct phases of disease demonstrated that non-vaccinated

294

animals had higher rates of sequence change compared to vaccinated animals during early (0.24

295

vs. 0.08 substitutions/site/year) and transitional (0.17 vs. 0.09 subs/site/yr) phases (Table 2),

296

though these differences were not statistically significant. During the persistent phase, the

297

substitution rates were similar for non-vaccinated and vaccinated cohorts (0.11 versus 0.10

298

subs/site/yr). A gradual accrual of substitutions, consistent with canonical evolutionary

299

processes, was commonly observed as demonstrated by animal 14-34 between 17dpi-35dpi and

300

animal 14-110 from 21dpi-35dpi (Fig 2a). However, the unprecedented rates as measured

301

alongside substitution patterns between consecutive samples consisting of synchronous changes

302

across the genome suggested a process that was more complex than independent nucleotide

303

substitution. Specifically, sample-to-sample substitution patterns that represented irregular jumps

304

in substitution rates (Fig 2) were highly suggestive of linkage between variant nucleotides

305

representing distinct genotypes. The rapidity and scope of this phenomenon were exemplified in

306

animal 14-34, where 17 nucleotide changes in 7 genes, spanning Lpro to 3D, differed at the

307

consensus level within a 24-hour period (6 to 7 dpi; Fig 2 and S1 Fig). Subsequently, a set of 17

308

(mostly revertant) nucleotide changes differed between 9 and 17 dpi in this same animal,

309

suggesting shifts in dominance between variant viral genomes.

Phylogenetic associations

319

Phylogenetic analysis led to delineation of seven distinct clades (I-VII, Fig 3). A unique set of

320

variant nucleotides defined each clade with a minimum of 2 substitutions differentiating clades

321

IV, VI, or VII (red, purple, and pink) and a maximum of 8 nucleotide changes differentiating

322

clade III members (green) from all other viruses. Importantly, the clade-characterizing nucleotide

323

changes identified in the animal samples were also present as subconsensus variants within the

324

inoculum, wherein they averaged 27.2% frequency (2.4 – 48.9%) (Fig 1). As expected, when

325

using the inoculum as the root, the earliest sampled virus sequences were basal, while later

326

samples tended to lay furthest from the root. Yet, there were numerous outliers such as the 10 dpi

327

nasopharyngeal tissue sample from animal 14-49 and the 8 dpi saliva sample from animal 14-34

328

(both in clade III), for which the long branch lengths indicated that substantial changes occurred

329

at these intermediate time points. Viruses were initially expected to cluster according to

330

individual animal IDs, with sequential progression of divergence and later samples descending

331

from earlier in-host viruses. However, that pattern was not consistent. Instead, virus samples

332

were often found to share a closer phylogenetic relationship with those obtained from other

333

animals (Fig 3). For example, clades I and V include viruses derived from 4 and 5 different

334

hosts, respectively.

340

Clade shifts within animals

341

A clade shift was defined by the consensus sequence obtained at a given time point sharing a

342

closer phylogenetic relationship to a different group of viruses as compared to the preceding

343

sample from the same animal. Clade shifts took place in all serially-sampled cattle except animal

344

15-54, from which only three samples from the transitional and persistent phase were available

345

for analysis. There were also instances of viruses of different clades coexisting in distinct

346

samples collected at the same time point from an individual host (e.g. 14-25 at 3 dpi; Fig 4).

347

However, there was no consistent pattern of association between the sample type and the clade of

348

virus identified (Fig 4). Interestingly, clade reversion (return of a clade previously dominant

349

within the same host) only occurred in vaccinated animals (animals 15-12 and 15-13); thus, in

350

non-vaccinated animals, once a clade was cleared to below consensus, it did not return within the

351

course of the study. There was no clear trend for any specific clade to dominate early infection.

352

Rather, viruses belonging to five of the seven clades were identified in samples collected from

353

the earliest samples (Fig 4).

354

There were several unique attributes to the clade shifts that occurred during the transitional phase

355

of infection. Overall, there was a relatively high quantity of clade shifts during this period; all 7

356

clades and every animal sampled during this period manifested at least one clade shift. Clades III

357

and VI were only detected during a relatively small temporal window spanning the end of the

358

early phase through the transitional phase of infection; both of these clades were extinguished

359

during the transitional phase. There was a strong tendency for consensus virus sequences not to

360

undergo clade shifts during the persistent phase; however, individual consensus nucleotide

361

changes continued throughout this period and were substantial in some animals (Figs 2 and 4).

362

Only two clade shifts were identified during the persistent phase of infection, and both occurred

363

in (vaccinated) animal 15-13 which had a shift from clade V to I and then back to V (Fig 4).

364

Although 5 of the 7 clades were identified during persistent infection, clade V was ultimately

365

overrepresented in the final 35 dpi samples, present at the consensus level in 3 of the 5 cattle

366

sampled at this late time point.

373

used to define progression of infection in individual animals: early, transitional, and persistent

374

periods; temporal boundaries for the phases differ in vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals, as

375

described in methods.

376

Structural analysis

377

The FMDV capsid surface proteins VP3, VP2 and VP1 contain several well defined antigenic

378

sites that are targeted by the antibody-mediated host response. Modeling and structural analysis

379

of the virus capsid was performed in order to correlate viral genomic changes with associated

380

changes in virus capsid structure. This investigation focused on the detection of amino acid

381

substitutions present at sites, previously determined to be antigenically significant [51].

382

Structural modeling of the FMDV-A24 Cruzeiro capsid protomer including proteins VP1, VP2,

383

and VP3 indicated that major antigenic sites and adjacent regions harbored a substantial

384

proportion of variable residues (Table 3, Fig 5). As VP4 lines the capsid interior, it was excluded

385

from this part of the analysis. The two most common amino acid substitutions that became fixed

386

in the animal samples were in VP1 sites 144 and 147 (Table 3). Notably, these amino acid

387

residues are within the receptor-binding site in the antigenically dominant G-H loop of VP1.[52,

388

53] (Fig 5). A threonine to methionine substitution at VP1 site 147 was the most frequently

389

observed amino acid change (Table 3). This substitution preserves the local hydrophobic pocket

390

that is important for host receptor binding and antibody neutralization (Fig 5b). Deep sequencing

391

of the inoculum virus indicated that methionine was present at this position at a frequency of

392

47.5% prior to exposure to animals, which may account for this commonly observed substitution.

393

In contrast to this finding at VP1 147, arginine at VP1 144 was present at <2% frequency in the

394

inoculum, yet a serine to arginine substitution at this position was found in 20 out of the 52

395

sampled viruses, all obtained ≥7 dpi (Table 3). Other substitutions that occurred at sites adjacent

396

to antigenically relevant locations and were found in samples from multiple animals were

397

threonine to lysine at VP3 175 (Fig 5a, c) and glutamic acid to lysine or glycine at VP3 131 (Fig

398

5a). The VP3 T175K substitution was present only in clade VI viruses and was found in samples

399

from animals 15-12 and 15-14 during early infection. Interestingly, the VP1 S144R and VP3

400

T175K substitutions did not co-exist in any haplotype (Table 3), suggesting that the lysine at

401

VP3 175 may represent an accommodation to the atypical serine at VP1 144 that was present in

402

the inoculum and the majority of early phase animal samples. VP1 199 is located at the VP1 C-

403

terminus (Fig 5a, d) and has also been identified as critical for integrin binding [54]. An

404

aspartic acid to glycine substitution at this position was found in two samples obtained at 10

405

and 14 dpi, respectively. This D199G substitution causes a loss of local hydrogen bonding

406

(Fig 5d) and can affect the conformation and surface charge of the antigenically critical VP1

407

C-terminus (Fig 5e, middle panel). Other substitutions with potential influence on the capsid

structure were VP2 residues 82, 88, and 131. Substitutions that occurred at these sites were

409

transient and disappeared during later stages of infection, highlighting the dynamic nature of

410

virus evolution and host pressure.

443

In order to investigate FMDV evolution within natural hosts, cattle were experimentally infected

444

with a complex, heterogeneous inoculum by a simulated natural route and progeny virus samples

445

were collected over the course of 35 days post inoculation. Analysis of the virus consensus

446

sequences obtained during different phases of infection suggested that at least two distinct

447

processes contribute to within-host FMDV genomic changes: 1) conventional molecular

448

evolution characterized by selection acting upon individual, de novo nucleotide substitutions

449

and/or resultant amino acid changes, and 2) emergence and regression of full-genome minority

450

haplogroup members over the course of infection.

451

The current study provides a detailed demonstration of the phenomenon of the multiplicity of

452

founding infections and emergence of subconsensus variants as a common mechanism of FMDV

453

evolution in natural hosts through all stages of infection. These data also demonstrate that

454

consensus-level nucleotide changes detected during early infection were predominantly present

455

at subconsensus level in the inoculum. The frequent haplotype shift observed within hosts is

456

consistent with previous investigations of FMDV molecular evolution that have demonstrated

457

that multiple divergent genotypes can be maintained within a host for extended periods of time.

458

Specifically, strong evidence has been presented of distinct FMDV subpopulation co-existence in

459

water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) [13, 55] and cattle [56] during persistent infection. Similarly,

460

African cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) can simultaneously carry up to three FMDV serotypes for

461

as long as 185 days after initial infection [57]. Additionally, a separate experimental study

462

demonstrated that FMDV diversity was regularly maintained through transmission chains with

463

specific variants reaching consensus in different acute-phase samples [19].

464

In the current study, the diverse virus subgroups present in the inoculum established multiple

465

founder infections and individual haplotypes subsequently emerged at the consensus level at

466

different times in different hosts. Phylogenetic analysis placed viruses from different animals

467

into shared clades, supporting the hypothesis that these viruses (clade members) shared common

468

ancestry present in the inoculum. If this phylogeny had occurred purely by drift and selection of

469

non-linked nucleotide differences, the boundaries of each clade would be expected to be largely

470

defined by substitutions unique to each animal. In contrast, 5 of the 7 clades contained viruses

471

sampled from multiple animals.

472

Comparing virus isolates collected at the same time and from the same animal but from different

473

anatomic locations provided examples of 3 distinct phenomena of within-host diversity: 1)

474

identical consensus sequences across samples, 2) within-clade divergent sequences, and 3)

475

viruses belonging to different clades. This range of possibilities demonstrates that at any specific

476

time during infection, the virus population was evolving at both the individual nucleotide and

477

haplotypic levels and that this evolution occurred independently at different sites within the same

478

animal. The observed phenomenon of within-host diversity may have implications for various

479

aspects of pathogenesis and transmission. In particular, chains of transmission may be affected,

480

since only viruses at certain locations are likely to be directly transmitted to other animals (e.g.

481

nasal swabs and lesions, but not serum or OPF).

482

This investigation included samples from both vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle. As

483

previously reported [28], there were striking differences in infection dynamics between the two

484

cohorts; while all non-vaccinated animals had a phase of fulminant clinical disease with systemic

485

generalization, infection in vaccinated cattle was subclinical and restricted to the upper

486

respiratory tract. These differences in infection dynamics correlated with contrasting

487

evolutionary processes taking place in the different cohorts of cattle. While the substitution rates

488

measured in the present study were not interpreted as representing novel or fixed mutations,

489

these computations allowed for comparisons across disease phases and vaccination status.

490

Collectively, the virus substitution rate in non-vaccinated cattle was relatively high during early

491

infection and decreased through disease progression. Contrastingly, in vaccinated cattle, the

492

substitution rate was lower and relatively unchanged across progressing phases of disease.

493

Although multiple instances of re-emergence of specific clades were found within the vaccinated

494

animals, this phenomenon could not be inferred in the non-vaccinated cohort. Thus, viruses that

495

transiently emerged in non-vaccinated animals did not re-occur at later time points. This

496

superiority of clade-specific clearance in non-vaccinated animals may reflect differences in the

497

host immune response during early [22] or late [28, 34] infection. One possible explanation is

498

that a primed immune response in vaccinated animals led to fewer clades successfully seeding

499

infection (i.e. stronger bottleneck).

500

It is likely that both evolutionary processes (clade emergence and within-clade evolution) are

501

ultimately influenced by host immune factors acting upon the viruses’ intrinsic abilities to evade

502

such pressures. In general, the higher proportion of substitutions, especially non-synonymous

503

changes, present in structural as compared to non-structural genes (Table 1) suggests that

504

conventional immunological pressures influence within-host virus evolution. These observations

505

are consistent with the concept of molecular memory which suggests that the viral swarm retains

506

previously adapted (e.g. escape mutant) viruses at low frequencies as an explanation for the

507

observed complexity of FMDV populations [18, 58, 59].

508

One of the intentions of this study was to investigate viral genomic changes associated with

509

different phases of infection defined as early, transitional, and carrier (persistent) phases.

510

Consensus viruses sampled during early infection were notably diverse in their clade

511

associations, which is of specific relevance as this is when infected animals are most contagious

512

and likely to transmit disease [60, 61]. The vast majority of early consensus-level nucleotide

513

changes corresponded to variants that were present at subconsensus level in the inoculum. This

514

illustrates that the diversity present in the primary infecting virus population has a substantial

515

effect upon the nature of the founding infection(s) suggesting that the role of immune-driven

516

selection may be less influential than stochastic processes in the very early stages of FMDV

517

pathogenesis.

518

The transitional phase of infection is the period during which animals either successfully clear

519

the virus or develop into persistently infected carriers [28]. Therefore, this specific period is of

520

particular interest due to the potentially significant selective pressures by the host immune

521

response. Consequently, FMDV clade shifts occurred in every animal that was sampled through

522

the transitional phase of infection. Recent investigations have suggested that virus clearance is

523

associated with an activated cellular immune response [34, 42]. It is possible that transitional

524

phase clade shifts are a result of this activated host response, and that virus populations unable to

525

effectively evade this pressure are those that allow for complete clearance. Contrastingly, clade

526

shifts were largely absent during persistent infection. This finding also may relate to the recent

527

finding that cell-mediated killing as well as inflammatory- and apoptotic pathways are reduced in

528

carriers [34, 42], potentially facilitating the stabilization of surviving virus populations.

529

The limited but clear emergence of amino acid substitutions within, and near, well-defined

530

antigenic epitopes in the virus capsid inspired the analysis of capsid structural changes.

531

Presumably, the strong selective pressure exerted by the adaptive immune response selects for

532

epitope escape variants. Most of these substitutions occurred in different clade backgrounds

533

which also suggests selective pressure dominating over stochastic drift. The only capsid

534

substitutions that were detected earlier than 5 dpi were pre-existent variants that were present in
26

535

the inoculum at high frequencies (nt positions 1903 (VP3 131) and 2615 (VP1 147) at 23.0% at

536

47.5%, respectively), suggesting some delay in mutation-evasion. Three of the amino acid

537

substitutions that occurred within receptor-binding domains, namely VP1 144, VP1 199 and VP3

538

175 encoded qualitatively divergent amino acids, thereby drastically impacting local noncovalent

539

bonding. This suggests that strong selection related to host cell entry may be driving these

540

changes. The serine to arginine substitution at VP1 144 was found in all samples obtained later

541

than 10 dpi from non-vaccinated animals, and in 2 out of 4 vaccinated animals that were

542

followed through to the persistent phase of infection. Consequently, serine at VP1 144, which

543

was present at a frequency of approximately 98% in the inoculum, was maintained through to the

544

persistent phase of infection in only two vaccinated animals. This VP1 S144R change arose in

545

the background of clades I-V by way of two different codon mutations, strongly suggesting that

546

arginine is advantageous at this position. This is also consistent with most wild-type FMDV

547

sequences, which overwhelmingly contain arginine at this position [62]. The dynamic

548

appearance and disappearance virus populations coupled with substitutions at the major

549

antigenic sites suggests the existence of an antigenic selection process during long-term

550

(persistent) infection. Additional investigations aimed at providing a comprehensive analysis of

551

FMDV structural adaptations are ongoing.

552

Conclusions

553

This investigation was the first study to evaluate the full FMDV coding sequence across multiple

554

animals through several distinct stages of infection in a natural host species. Characterization of

555

consensus viruses in animal samples indicated dynamic patterns of emergence of pre-existing

556

minority virus haplotypes (clade shifts). These clade shifts were responsible for the majority of

557

consensus-level changes in multiple sample types. However, individual nucleotide substitutions,

558

not otherwise associated with particular ancestral genotypes also occurred, presumably through

559

point mutation. In every animal, the transitional phase of infection included a clade shift,

560

whereas few clade shifts occurred during persistent infection, despite ongoing genomic changes.

561

Overall, the data presented herein suggest that substantially different immunological, virological,

562

and pathological selective processes occur during distinct phases of FMDV infection. More

563

specifically, these findings suggest that the combination of host selective pressures and viral

564

evolutionary mechanisms which enable the establishment of FMDV persistent infection may be

565

distinct from the processes which allow maintenance of persistence.
