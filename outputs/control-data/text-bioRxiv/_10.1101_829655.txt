Summary
Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a major side effect
from cancer treatment with no known method for prevention or cure in clinics. CIPN
primarily affects unmyelinated nociceptive sensory terminals. Despite the high
prevalence of CIPN, molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to CIPN are still
poorly understood. Here, we used a genetically tractable Drosophila model and
primary sensory neurons isolated from adult mouse to examine the mechanisms
underlying CIPN and identify protective pathways. We found that chronic treatment
of Drosophila larvae with paclitaxel caused sensory neuron degeneration, altered the
terminal branching pattern of nociceptive neurons, and reduced thermal nociceptive
responses. We found that nociceptive neuron-specific overexpression of integrins,
which are known to support neuronal maintenance in several systems, conferred
protection from paclitaxel-mediated cellular and behavioral phenotypes. Live imaging
and superresolution approaches provide evidence that paclitaxel treatment causes
cellular changes that are consistent with alterations in endosome-mediated trafficking
of integrins. We used primary dorsal root ganglia neuron cultures to test conservation
of integrin-mediated protection. We show that overexpression of a human integrin β
subunit 1 (ITGB1) also prevented degeneration following paclitaxel treatment.
Altogether, our study supports conserved mechanisms of paclitaxel-induced
perturbation of integrin trafficking and a therapeutic potential of restoring integrin
levels to antagonize paclitaxel-mediated toxicity in sensory neurons.

Introduction
Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) develops in over 60%
of cancer patients and survivors (Seretny et al., 2014). CIPN significantly impacts
quality of life as damage of sensory nerves may be permanent (Peltier and Russell,
2002), and is often a dose-limiting factor during cancer treatment. Patients with CIPN
report pain-related symptoms including allodynia, hyper or hypoalgesia, or pain that
can be more severe than the pain associated with the original cancer (Han and Smith,
2013). Despite increasing data on agents that protect sensory nerves, our limited
understanding of the mechanisms of CIPN impedes effective treatment (Cavaletti and
Marmiroli, 2010; Chua and Kroetz, 2017; Lisse et al., 2016). Studies from model
systems may be helpful in identifying molecules that protect morphology from the
effects of chemotherapeutics.
In the current study, we explored the mechanisms of CIPN induced by
paclitaxel using two established models, Drosophila larval nociceptive neurons
(Bhattacharya et al., 2012; Brazill et al., 2018) and primary DRG neurons isolated
from adult mouse (Gornstein and Schwarz, 2017). Similar to other peripheral
neuropathies, CIPN primarily affects unmyelinated intraepidermal nerve fibers that
detect painful or noxious stimuli (Aley et al., 1996; Bennett et al., 2011; Lauria et al.,
2003; Schmidt et al., 1997; Siau and Bennett, 2006; Tanner et al., 1998; Xiao et al.,
2011). These small fibers are embedded in the epidermis, and continuously turn over
coincident with the turnover of skin (Bennett et al., 2011). Drosophila class IV
nociceptive neurons are a favored model for genetic studies of nociceptive neuron
development and signaling mechanisms. Prior studies showed that class IV neuron
morphology is sensitive to paclitaxel and demonstrated changes of nociceptive
neurons at the onset and the end stage of CIPN (Bhattacharya et al., 2012; Brazill et
al., 2018). Specifically, a chronic treatment at a high dose (30µM) induced
fragmentation and dramatic simplification of branching of sensory terminals
(Bhattacharya et al., 2012). Additionally, acute treatments of moderate doses (1020µM) induced hyperbranching of sensory arbors without changing the branch
patterns (Brazill et al., 2018). Nociceptive neurons in Drosophila larvae detect
multiple qualities of noxious stimuli, and project naked nerve terminals that are
partially embedded in the epidermis (Hall and Treinin, 2011; Im and Galko, 2012).

Larvae have a stereotyped behavioral response towards noxious stimuli that can serve
as a readout of nociceptive neuron function (Burgos et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2016;
Hwang et al., 2007; Poe et al., 2017). Nociceptive neurons in Drosophila larvae may
therefore serve as a good in vivo model to study sensory changes induced by
chemotherapeutics at morphological and functional levels.
Paclitaxel binds to tubulin and protect microtubules from disassembly. It is a
commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for treatment of solid cancers such as breast,
ovarian and lung cancers by virtue of its ability to inhibit cell division. Paclitaxel is
more likely than other chemotherapeutics to cause chronic sensory neuropathy in
patients and animal models (Gornstein and Schwarz, 2014; Hershman et al., 2011;
Majithia et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2018; Wozniak et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2011).
Several CIPN animal and in vitro models have also revealed acute effects of
paclitaxel (Brazill et al., 2018; Gornstein and Schwarz, 2017; Lisse et al., 2016;
Pease-Raissi et al., 2017; Shemesh and Spira, 2010). While the mechanisms of acute
and chronic neurodegeneration are likely to be distinct (Reichling and Levine, 2011),
how long-term treatment of paclitaxel can affect sensory neuron morphology and
function, and how neuronal arbors can be protected against long-term toxicity is not
understood.
Several studies have shown that nociceptive sensory terminals share a close
relationship with specific extracellular structures, most notably epidermal cells and
extracellular matrix (ECM), yet whether paclitaxel impact this relationship is
unknown. Integrins are a key mediator of the interaction between cells and the ECM,
and impact neuronal maintenance in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems (Han et
al., 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Moreno-Layseca et al., 2019; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2018).
We therefore explored whether and how integrin-ECM interactions may impact
sensory neuron maintenance upon paclitaxel-induced toxicity.
Here, we have used Drosophila and isolated mouse DRG neurons to
investigate the pathological effect of paclitaxel in sensory neurons. Morphological
changes occurred at paclitaxel doses that also caused changes in thermal nociceptive
behaviors. Cell-specific overexpression of integrins protected nociceptive neurons
from morphological alterations and prevented the thermal nociceptive behavior
deficits caused by paclitaxel. This was consistent with the observation that paclitaxel
affected the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and reduced integrin mediated recycling
in Drosophila. Transduction of integrins also protected adult mouse DRG sensory

neurons from paclitaxel-mediated toxicity in vitro indicating that integrin mediated
protection is conserved in a vertebrate model of CIPN. Our study suggests that altered
interactions between sensory neurons and their extracellular environment are an
important contributor to paclitaxel mediated neuronal pathology.
Results
Paclitaxel alters the branching pattern of Drosophila nociceptive neurons
We first sought to confirm and extend prior results on the effect of paclitaxel
on sensory dendrites using high-resolution analysis of terminal morphology. We
administered paclitaxel (10, 20 and 30μM) in food beginning from 24-28h AEL (early
1st instar). By this stage, da sensory neurons have completed axon pathfinding and
formed major branches (Gao et al., 1999). All of these paclitaxel concentrations were
previously used as models for CIPN (Bhattacharya et al., 2012; Brazill et al., 2018).
We dissected treated larvae at the late 3rd instar stage and found that while survival of
larvae treated with 30μM was rare (<5% survival rate by 3rd instar stages), animals
tolerated 10 and 20μM well and often survived past 3rd instar stages. da neuron
branches still broadly covered their receptive field in larvae fed 10 and 20μM (Figure
1A-C), but neurons showed morphological changes such as pre-degenerative
varicosities and degenerative fragmentation (Supplemental Figure 1, Figure 2).
Nociceptive neurons in animals treated with 10μM did not show an overt change in
branching pattern. By contrast, 20μM treatments induced marked changes in
branching patterns. Peripheral arbors were sporadically clumped and patchy in
proximal regions of the arbor and depleted in more distal regions (Figure 1A-C,
Supplemental Figure 2A-D). Density analysis revealed that control nociceptive
arbors have a peak at ~5% (% of area that is occupied by branches within 50 ´ 50
µm2 (Figure 1D Supplemental Figure 2A). By contrast, paclitaxel dose-dependently
increased overall local density of nociceptive arbors which showed no clear peaks in
their distribution (Figure 1D). By plotting the data according to the distance from
soma, we found that paclitaxel specifically caused increase in the proximal branch
density (Figure 1E), also supported by Sholl analysis Supplemental Figure 1E).
Neither concentration of paclitaxel caused a change in total dendrite length compared

to control (Figure 1F). On the contrary, we found that 20μM, but not 10μM treatment
increased the total number of dendrite branch points (Figure 1G). Thus, to explore the
events that may precede degeneration of nociceptive arbors, we used both 10 and
20μM and focused on using 20μM of paclitaxel as a dose to further study the effects
on Drosophila nociceptive arbors.
Paclitaxel induced changes are prevented by cell-specific integrin overexpression

In addition to causing degeneration in nociceptive neurons, paclitaxel feeding
resulted in extensive branch overlap, indicating a failure of self-avoidance (Figure 2A,
C, C’, E, F). Two parallel mechanisms impact self-avoidance in Drosophila sensory
dendrites. Dscam1-mediated recognition between sister dendrites results in repulsion
and avoidance (Hughes et al., 2007; Matthews et al., 2007; Soba et al., 2007). In
parallel, integrin receptors for the extracellular matrix maintain dendrites in an

approximately 2D arrangement so dendrites come into contact with another rather
than grow over or under each other (Grueber et al., 2002; Han et al., 2012; Kim et al.,
2012). 3D crossing can be reduced or eliminated by overexpression of integrins.
Overlapping arbors therefore raised the possibility that paclitaxel perturbs one of
these self-avoidance mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of
αPS1 and βPS integrins in nociceptive neurons significantly lessened paclitaxelinduced dendrite crossing (Figure 2B, D, D', E). Remarkably, integrin overexpression
also prevented paclitaxel-induced degenerative phenotypes (Figure 2D, D’, F). We
compared this result with another cell adhesion receptor N-cadherin, that are also
shown to promote cellular growth through cell-cell interaction (Doherty et al., 1991;
Ferguson and Scherer, 2012). We found that N-cadherin overexpression in
nociceptive neurons only partially prevented paclitaxel-mediated phenotypes
(Supplemental Figure 3) arguing against the conclusion that integrin mediated
protection is a mere consequence of a general increased adhesion of nociceptive
neuron terminals (Supplemental Figure 3, compare with Figure 2E, F). Altogether,
our results indicate that augmentation of integrins provides protection against
paclitaxel-mediated neuropathy.
Integrin overexpression prevents paclitaxel-induced change in thermal
nociceptive response
Drosophila larvae show a stereotyped nocifensive behavior in response to
thermal or mechanical noxious stimuli consisting of sequential C-shaped body
bending, lateral rolling, and fast escape crawl (Burgos et al., 2018; Hwang et al.,
2007; Ohyama et al., 2013; Tracey et al., 2003). We administered paclitaxel at 1, 10,
and 20μM and tested for heat-induced nocifensive behavior. We observed a
significant decrease in nocifensive responses at 10 and 20μM, but not at 1μM (Figure
2G). To determine if paclitaxel exerted an effect on sensory neurons or somewhere
downstream of primary nociceptors, we performed a circuit epistasis experiment
(Supplementary Figure 4). We fed larvae paclitaxel and activated downstream
circuitry by expressing TrpA in Down and back (DnB) neurons, one of the main
downstream targets of larval nociceptive neurons (Burgos et al., 2018).
Thermogenetic activation of DnB neurons elicits bending and rolling behavior
(Burgos et al., 2018), so we predicted that direct activation of DnB neurons would
still be able to induce rolling behavior if the nociceptive neurons were the major

target of paclitaxel. Indeed, activation of DnB neurons was as effective at inducing
nociceptive behaviors with and without paclitaxel feeding. These results suggest that
paclitaxel likely disrupts nociceptive behavior through action on primary sensory
neurons rather than downstream circuitry.
We next examined whether integrin overexpression in nociceptive neurons can
restore nocifensive behavior in paclitaxel-treated larvae. We found that changes in the
levels of integrins or overexpression of N-cadherin did not alter nociceptive responses
relative to genotype controls, although we did find that low and high integrin levels in
nociceptive neurons lead to differences in the number of rolls initiated per nocifensive
bout (Supplemental Figure 5). By contrast, at both 10 and 20μM of paclitaxel,
overexpression of integrins in nociceptors led to a significantly stronger response to
heat-induced rolling compared to genotype controls (Figure 2H). These results
demonstrate that cell-specific integrin overexpression in nociceptive neurons prevents
degeneration and disorganization of nociceptive neurons, and maintains function of
these neurons in detecting noxious heat stimuli.

Paclitaxel disrupts endosomal-lysosomal pathways and changes integrin
trafficking in Drosophila
We next investigated the cellular changes in neurons caused by paclitaxel
treatment that could be offset by augmenting integrin levels. Conceivably, these
changes could include reduction in de novo integrin synthesis, reduced integrin
recycling, and/or increased integrin degradation. Prior studies in other systems
indicate that integrin levels are maintained by continuous recycling via tight
regulation of the endosomal pathway rather than degradation and de novo synthesis
(Moreno-Layseca et al., 2019). We therefore investigated potential changes caused by
paclitaxel in endosomal and lysosomal pathways in nociceptive neurons in
Drosophila. To initially assess overall changes in the endocytic pathway, we chose
two markers, the small GTPase Rab4 and the transporter protein Spinster. Rab4
mediates the early endosome to recycling endosome transition and is found in both
early and recycling endosomes (Hoogenraad et al., 2010; Sonnichsen et al., 2000;
Vonderheit and Helenius, 2005). Spinster plays a critical role in the autophagylysosome transition and is found in late endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes
(Nakano et al., 2001; Rong et al., 2011). We expressed Rab4-RFP and Spinster-RFP
in nociceptive neurons and monitored their dynamics in primary neurites in late third
instar larvae.
High-resolution time-lapse images (see Methods) revealed a bidirectional
trafficking of Rab4 positive endosomes of various sizes and speeds (Figure 3A).
Unlike morphological changes, which showed paclitaxel dose-dependence, we found
that the effects on Rab4 and Spinster trafficking were concentration independent
(Figure 3C-G). Paclitaxel treatment caused a higher portion of Rab4 positive vesicles
to become stationary at the expense of both anterograde and retrograde motility
(Figure 3C) and the motile pool of Rab4 positive vesicles showed a reduced velocity
and a higher frequency of direction switching (Figure 3D, E). Motile vesicles showed
a significant reduction in density, whereas paclitaxel treatment did not affect the
density of stationary vesicles (Figure 3F). In addition, both 10 and 20μM paclitaxel
caused a marked enlargement of Spinster positive lysosomes. Together, our result
demonstrates disruptions in both recycling endosome and lysosomal pathways by
paclitaxel.

We next tested whether these changes could affect cargos such as integrins,
that are required for the maintenance of nociceptive terminals. To demonstrate
whether intracellular localization of integrins is changed due to paclitaxel mediated
changes in endosomal-lysosomal pathways, we have expressed Rab4-YFP, aPS1 and
bPS in nociceptive neurons (Figure 3H, I). We double labelled Rab4 and bPS
integrins, and then imaged using superresolution microscopy (York et al., 2013) to
quantify their co-localization in soma, dendrites and proximal axon. Consistent with
the results obtained from live imaging of Rab4 trafficking, the number of Rab4
vesicles that colocalized with integrins in nociceptive arbors (dendrites) was
significantly reduced by paclitaxel (Figure 3J-L). While we cannot exclude roles for
degradation and de novo synthesis in the regulation of integrin levels, our data
indicate that paclitaxel disrupts Rab4-mediated recycling of integrins. Together with
the observed increase in lysosome compartment, these intracellular changes could
affect the availability of integrins in support of nociceptive arbor maintenance.
ITGB1 transduction in adult mouse DRG neurons prevents axon degeneration
We next asked whether integrin-mediated protection from paclitaxel is also
observed in vertebrate neurons. Since augmentation of a single integrin subunit can
recruit endogenous subunit partners (Condic, 2001; Huet-Calderwood et al., 2017),
we chose to transduce the human integrin β1 subunit 1 (ITGB1), a common subunit in
all heteromeric dimers in adult DRG neurons in rodents (Plantman et al., 2008;
Tomaselli et al., 1993; Wallquist et al., 2004). Lentivirus mediated delivery of ITGB1
was carried out in adult DRG neurons at 5DIV prior to treatment with either vehicle
or 50nM paclitaxel for 72 hours starting at 12DIV, an experimental paradigm that had
been previously shown to induce early and late signs of axon degeneration (Gornstein
and Schwarz, 2017). To better capture the changes in the cells in culture and to avoid
selection bias, we have sampled large areas (2 x 2 mm2) for the quantification. We
found that treating DRGs with paclitaxel resulted in axon loss and axon fragmentation
(Figure 4A- B’) as shown by a significant decrease in total axon area and increased
degeneration index (a ratio between fragmented axon and total axon areas) compared
to control DRG neurons (Figure 4E, F, Supplemental Figure 5). Consistent with the
protective capacity shown in Drosophila nociceptive neurons, DRG neurons
transduced with ITGB1 prior to paclitaxel treatment showed no change in total axon

Discussion
In this study, we used Drosophila larval sensory neurons and adult mouse
DRG neurons in culture to investigate the underlying mechanisms of CIPN induced
by paclitaxel. By using cellular, genetic, and behavioral approaches, we demonstrate
that integrin overexpression protects sensory neurons from paclitaxel treatment. We
identified paclitaxel-mediated morphological changes in nociceptive neurons, and
report quantitative changes in branch pattern arising from paclitaxel exposure. We
report that overexpressing integrins, cell surface receptors critical during development
and maintenance of non-neuronal cells and neurons (Hynes, 1992; Moreno-Layseca et
al., 2019), protects nociceptive neuron morphology and function in Drosophila, and
reduces axon degeneration in adult DRG neurons in vitro. We combined live imaging,
high resolution and superresolution microscopy to identify the intracellular
mechanisms that underlie integrin-mediated protection. Our results show that
paclitaxel alters the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, and reduces recycling of integrins
in vivo. Based on these data, we propose that paclitaxel alters intracellular pathways
within nociceptive neurons and thereby disrupts the delivery of key cell surface
receptors involved in interactions with the extracellular environment. This disruption
leads to deficits in arbor maintenance, and eventually degeneration of nociceptive
terminals.
Integrins provide a link between sensory neurons and the extracellular environment
Intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENFs) are highly sensitive peripheral sensory
structures because of their caliber and location adjacent to a highly dynamic
epidermis (Bennett et al., 2011). Moreover, in the context of CIPN, recent studies in
zebrafish indicate that epidermal cells are directly affected by paclitaxel and that
epidermal changes precede neuronal degradation. In this system, blocking MMP13
signals that promote the degradation of the extracellular matrix and epidermis could
partially rescue the neuronal damage caused by paclitaxel (Lisse et al., 2016). These
prior studies indicate that degradation of neuronal substrates contributes to
degeneration of adjacent arbors (Lisse et al., 2016). It is therefore essential to
determine how sensory terminals are maintained in the context of a dynamic
extracellular environment that can itself become sensitized to chemotherapeutic
insults. Integrins are key cell surface receptors that link neuronal membranes to the

extracellular matrix and our data show that they are a strong candidate factor that
could mitigate the neuropathic effects of certain chemotherapeutics. Identification of
the ligands that are involved in this protection is an important goal for future studies.
Alternative signaling pathways could also contribute to integrin-mediated protection.
For example, during the development of larval nociceptive neurons integrins also
form a complex with the conserved receptor tyrosine kinase Ret (Soba et al., 2015).
Together, they regulate the branching pattern of nociceptive neurons through
epidermal derived TGF-beta Maverick. This complex is required for regular
patterning, dynamic growth, and adhesion of dendritic branches (Hoyer et al., 2018;
Soba et al., 2015). Since adhesive roles for the Ret-integrin complex are conserved in
vertebrates (Cockburn et al., 2010), it is possible that similar co-receptors and ligands
may interact with integrins to mediate interactions between IENFs and their
extracellular environment.
Evidence that endocytic changes caused by paclitaxel perturb integrin recycling
We provide evidence that paclitaxel disrupts trafficking of recycling
endosomes in Drosophila peripheral nociceptive arbors. Specifically, we found a
decrease in small GTPase Rab4 motility and abundance, and a decrease in integrin
colocalization with Rab4 vesicles. Rab4 acts at the interface between early/sorting
endosomes and recycling endosomes, and is a key mediator of integrin recycling
(Arjonen et al., 2012; Moreno-Layseca et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2001). Perturbation
of Rab4 motility and availability would likely lead to reduced integrin turnover. By
contrast, we found enlargement of Spinster positive lysosomal compartments in
nociceptive neurons upon paclitaxel treatment. We have not directly examined
whether this change impacts lysosomal activity or integrin degradation. Notably, prior
studies in human non-small cell lung cancer cells in vitro have shown that paclitaxel
upregulates the release and activation of lysosomal protease cathepsin B (Broker et
al., 2004). Similarly, an increase in the activity of lysosomal enzymes was also
reported in mouse hepatocytes in vivo following paclitaxel treatment (Krol, 1998).
The exact mechanism leading to any of these changes is not known, however, the
studies together suggest that paclitaxel commonly affects lysosomes in cancer cells,
non-neuronal cells, and sensory neurons.
Interestingly, an opposing change of Rab4 and Spinster expression in our
CIPN model also adds to a growing list of survival and maintenance factors that are

modulated upon paclitaxel treatment. Paclitaxel reduces axonal expression of the prosurvival factor Bclw, but not Bcl2 or Bclx, in embryonic sensory neuron culture
(Pease-Raissi et al., 2017). MMP13 was selectively activated in epidermal cells but
not in neurons upon paclitaxel treatment (Lisse et al., 2016). Likewise, integrins may
be one of several cargos that is reduced in the plasma membrane as a consequence of
paclitaxel-mediated disruption in endo-lysosomal compartments. Integrin-mediated
pathways may be more susceptible to these changes because integrin surface
abundance relies heavily on the recycling and integrins may be continuously required
in dynamic cellular compartments, such as nociceptive terminals or the leading edge
of cancer cells (Arjonen et al., 2012; Han et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Roberts et al.,
2001; Roberts et al., 2004). Therefore, the integrin pathway may be relatively more
strongly affected by changes in endosomal pathways.
Substrate interactions in CIPN
Intraepidermal fiber (IENF) density correlates with severity of sensory
peripheral neuropathy in patients, and the change in morphology serves as the
strongest predictor of symptoms and prognosis in clinics (Hamid et al., 2014; Han and
Smith, 2013; Khoshnoodi et al., 2016; Polydefkis et al., 2002; Tseng et al., 2006). In
patients with chronic peripheral neuropathy, axon terminals are present in the
subepidermal layer (Kennedy et al., 1996), but absent in the epidermis. It is therefore
critical to understand the factors that help maintain terminal nerve fibers and that
could prevent their degeneration in CIPN. Our results show that integrin
supplementation promotes the maintenance of sensory terminals upon paclitaxel
treatment, suggesting that integrins could be a key factor in somatosensory terminal
maintenance to counteract CIPN. Our results suggest that integrin supplementation
promotes the maintenance of sensory terminals upon paclitaxel treatment. Notably,
other studies have shown that integrin levels are increased after neuron injury, and
levels correlate with regenerative ability (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2018). Differences in
integrin levels between peripheral DRG neurons and neurons in the CNS may
correlate with different abilities of these neurons to regenerate (Andrews et al., 2016).
Currently, there is no effective method of preventing or treating CIPN other
than stopping chemotherapeutic treatment or changing the chemotherapy regimen.
More than 80% of CIPN patients treated with paclitaxel still report symptoms six
months after the cessation of chemotherapeutic treatment (Hershman et al., 2011;

Majithia et al., 2016). Limited symptomatic relief is provided by opioid analgesics,
antidepressants, or anticonvulsants (Majithia et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2018). Our
results provide an in vivo model to study CIPN-induced changes in neurons, and have
identified and characterized integrins as a protective pathway. There is accumulating
evidence from the literature and clinics that underscore the importance of intrinsic
mechanisms in preventing neural degeneration. Our current study provides evidence
for changes in the ability of neurons to link to, and interact with, the extracellular
environment. Further studies of substrate interactions in CIPN models might provide
important insights into the mechanisms, etiology, and treatment of this condition.
Materials and methods
Fly stocks
UAS-αPS1 (multiple edematous wings, mew) on III and UAS-βPS (myospheroid,
mys) on II were provided by Dr. K. Broadie (Vanderbilt University). UAS-Ncad7b-13a18b

(on II) line was provided by Dr. Chi-Hon Lee (National Institute of Health).

Ppk1.9-Gal4 (II), ppkcd4tdgfp (III) and ppkcd4tdtom (III), and 412-Gal4 have been
described previously (Ainsley et al., 2003; Burgos et al., 2018; Gohl et al., 2011; Han
et al., 2011). W1118 and UAS-Rab4-mRFP, UAS-Spin-myc-mRFP, UAS-YFP-Rab4WT, UAS-βPS-RNAi, UAS-TrpA1 lines were obtained from the Bloomington Stock
Center (Bloomington, IN). Full genotypes of the animals used in the study can be
found in Supplemental Table 2.
Larval assay setup for paclitaxel treatment
Paclitaxel (Tocris Bioscience) was diluted to 5mM in ethanol, aliquoted and stored in
-80°C until use. Fresh aliquots of paclitaxel were diluted to a final concentration of 1
– 30μM in 1 × PBS, and a matching concentration of ethanol was added as a vehicle
control. This solution was used to make food using instant Drosophila medium
(Formula 4-24 ®, Carolina Biological Supply Company) immediately before starting
the larval assay. Embryos were collected on grape plates with yeast paste made with
0.5% propionic acid. First instar larvae (24 – 28h AEL) were collected manually with
a paint brush, washed in 1 × PBS, and placed into paclitaxel-containing food. Larvae
were reared at 25°C and were stage-matched to late third instar (based on the
morphology of anterior spiracles) at the time of collection. Controls typically reached
late third instar by 5-7 days. Any remaining animals that did not reach late third instar

by 10 days after starting the treatment were discarded. All animals matching the
developmental criteria were collected to avoid any selection bias.
Global activation heat nocifensive assay and behavioral analysis
Global activation heat nocifensive assays were performed as previously described
(Burgos et al., 2018) with a minor modification. Briefly, a single late third instar larva
(stage-matched) was placed on a 0.6% black ink gel (Super Black India ink,
Speedball) in 1% agarose in ddH2O heated to 40˚C by a peltier device (CP-031, TE
technology) equipped with a temperature controller (TC-36–25-RS232, TE
technology). Animals with matching genotype to experimental groups except UAS
transgenes were used as a genotype control. Where possible, paclitaxel treated
animals were set up two-three days prior to control, so that both control and paclitaxel
treated animals could be tested for nocifensive behavior on the same day. Behaviors
were recorded for 60 seconds, and quantified blindly. The number of 360˚ rolls was
scored by using trachea as a dorsal reference.
Lentiviral packaging of human ecto-tagged ITGB1
Ecto-tagged human β1 integrin (ecto-GFP-ITGB1) in lentiviral expression vector
(Huet-Calderwood et al., 2017) was kindly provided by David Calderwood’s lab at
Yale University. pLENTI CMV Puro DEST (AddGene plamid #17452, gift from Eric
Campeau) was purchased from AddGene. Lentiviruses containing pLENTI CMVecto-GFP-ITGB1 and a corresponding empty vector were produced according to
Gornstein and Schwarz with some modification (Gornstein and Schwarz, 2017).
Lentiviral expression vectors and packaging vectors (pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/VSVG,
Thermofisher) were co-transfected to HEK293T cells using the calcium phosphate
transfection method (Liu et al., 2014). Media containing viral particles were collected
24, 36, 48h after transfection, and lentiviral particles were filtered through 0.45μm,
and then concentrated by centrifuging at 25,900 RPM at 4°C for 120 min (SW 32 Ti
rotor, Beckman Coulter). The virus pellet was resuspended in Neurobasal media
(Invitrogen) without any supplement to concentrate 250-fold from the packaging cell
media, and stored in 30μl aliquots at -80°C until use. 5μl of lentivirus was added to
1ml culture at DIV 5, and ~30% of the media was changed before paclitaxel
administration at DIV 12. Expression of ITGB1 was checked by western blot.

Adult mouse DRG culture and paclitaxel treatment
All protocols and procedures used in this study to prepare primary culture of DRG
neurons were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of
Columbia University and according to Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals distributed by the National Institutes of Health. Dorsal root ganglia from 8to 12-week old C57Bl/6J mice of both sexes were dissected, dissociated and plated in
a 12-well plate. Specifically, the spinal column was isolated immediately from a
sacrificed mouse, and cut into approximately four pieces, including at the midline, to
expose DRG for isolation. Each piece was dissected within 5 minutes, and the
remaining tissue was placed on ice. Dissected DRG from cervical, thoracic and
lumbar anatomical regions was immediately placed in HBSS (Life Technologies) or
DMEM (Life Technologies) on ice. Once DRGs were collected, visible traces of axon
tracts were cleaned before incubating in 1mg/mL Collagenase A (Sigma) for 1h at 37
°C. Following incubation, DRGs were washed twice in DMEM followed by 0.05%
trypsin (Life Technologies) in DMEM digestion for 2 minutes at 37°C. After the
digestion, cells were washed twice with Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2%
B-27 (Invitrogen), 0.5mM glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% FBS (Sigma) and 100U/mL
penicillin-streptomycin. DRG ganglia were then dissociated by repeated gentle
pipetting until no clump was visible. Once dissociation was complete, cells were
resuspended in supplemented Neurobasal media with 10% FBS to 1.8 ml (150μl x 12
wells) and plated onto 12 well plates (over 18mm coverslips) that had been coated
overnight with 100μg/mL poly-D-lysine (Sigma) at 37°C and 10μg/mL laminin (Life
Technologies) for 1h at 37 °C. After 30 minutes, 850μl of supplemented Neurobasal
media was added to each well without disturbing plated cells. At 4DIV, ~30% of the
media was changed and 10μM AraC (Sigma) was administered to suppress growth of
non-neuronal cells in culture. Approximately 30% of the media was again changed at
12DIV prior to paclitaxel treatment. 1μl of 1000 × paclitaxel (stock concentration
50μM) was added to each well containing 1ml of media to achieve a final
concentration of 50nM. 1μl of DMSO was added as a vehicle control.
Immunolabelling
Immunolabelling of Drosophila larvae was performed largely as described previously
(Matthews et al., 2007). Briefly, late third instar larvae were dissected in 1 × PBS
within 10 minutes to minimize degeneration during dissection. Dissected larvae were

immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences) in
1 × PBS for 15 min, rinsed three times in 1 × PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-TX) for
permeabilization, and blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in 5% normal donkey
serum (NDS) in PBS-TX (Jackson Immunoresearch). Primary antibodies include
chicken anti-GFP (1:1000; Abcam), rabbit anti-DsRed (1:250, Clontech), and mouse
anti-mys (1:10, CF.6G11, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), diluted in 5%
NDS in PBS-TX. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C, and washed in
PBS-TX for 3 × 15 min. Species-specific, fluorophore-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at 1:1000 in 5% NDS in PBS-TX,
and incubated overnight 4°C. Tissue was rinsed in PBS-TX for 3 × 15 min with a
final rinse in PBS. Tissue was mounted on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips,
dehydrated 5 minutes each in an ascending ethanol series (30, 50, 70, 95, 2 × 100%),
cleared in xylenes (2 × 10 min), and mounted in DPX (Fluka).
For immunolabelling of DRG neurons, cultures were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS
for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 10 min, and blocked in 10%
normal goat serum in PBS (NGS-PBS) for 1h. Primary antibodies were chicken
NF200 (1:300, Aves Labs Catalog # NFH), rabbit ITGB1 (1:200, Invitrogen,
Catalog # PA5-29606), which were diluted in NGS-PBS and incubated overnight at
4°C. Nuclei were stained with Hoeschst 33342 (1:1000, Sigma), which was incubated
with primary antibodies. Species-specific, fluorophore-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Invitrogen) were used at 1:500 in 10% NGS-PBS and incubated for 2h at
the room temperature. Immunolabelled cells were then washed in 1 × PBS and
mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).
Image acquisition
Drosophila sensory neurons were imaged on a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal
microscope using a 60x 1.4 NA Plan Apochromat objective and a Yokogawa W1
spinning disk confocal microscope mounted on a Nikon Ti2-E stand using a 20x 0.75
NA Plan Apochromat objective. To avoid any selection bias, all animals from each
experiment were imaged, and up to four ddaC nociceptive neurons were selected from
abdominal segments. These cells were systematically and sequentially imaged in zstacks from anterior to posterior positions in each larva. One cell per larva was
systemically selected for quantification. For mouse DRG neurons Yokogawa W1
spinning disk confocal microscope was used. Images were collected initially in a

6mm × 6mm square in 2D, avoiding the peripheral region of the cultured cells. Three
random points were selected from this image, which served as the center of nonoverlapping z-stack images of 2mm × 2mm each.
Image analysis
Prior to tracing of nociceptive neurons, an image containing a single neuron was
blinded and the background was cleaned using background subtraction and non-local
means denoising in ImageJ/Fiji. Because axons would be confounded with peripheral
terminals during automatic detection, they were manually removed together with any
neuronal arbors from neurons in adjacent segments. To improve a better automatic
detection of arbors, brightness and contrast were optimized before processing in
Vaa3D. The Vaa3D neuron 2 auto tracing plugin (Liu et al., 2018) was used to
generate tracings of neuronal arbors. Any errors found in an automatically traced file
were manually corrected via manual annotation using editing tools included in the
neuron 2 plugin. The global neuron feature option was used to extract quantitative
information from the reconstruction.
All data collected from Drosophila was randomized and blinded prior to
quantification using customized python codes. Degeneration and overlap occurrences,
were scored independently in terminal neurites and all other non-terminal neurites
using the ImageJ/Fiji multi-point tool (Schindelin et al., 2012). We counted
varicosities and fragmentation as early and late signs of degeneration, respectively.
For quantifying branch overlap, we scored terminal dendrite overlap when at least one
arbor was terminal neurite. All imaging data collected from DRG axons was blinded
prior to quantification. For quantifying DRG degeneration phenotypes, a degeneration
index was calculated as described in Gerdts et al., 2011 (Gerdts et al., 2011).
Quantification was performed blindly using ImageJ/Fiji by an independent researcher
who was not involved in experimentation and imaging. Briefly, images were
automatically thresholded (global threshold) using a default auto-threshold method,
binarized, and then total and fragmented axon areas were measured by using the
particle analyzer plugin of ImageJ/Fiji. A circularity, determined as (area) / (p ×
radius2) and was calculated for each particle. Any particle of higher than 0.2 for
circularity was considered fragmented. The degeneration index was calculated as a
ratio of fragmented axon area over total axon area (Gerdts et al., 2011).

The local density of Drosophila sensory arbors was measured using a two-step
custom ImageJ/Fiji macro. All images used for local density analysis were collected
using identical settings on a Nikon A1R scanning laser confocal microscope.
performing density analysis, the image files were pre-processed as described for the
degeneration analysis. Local density was measured by a repeated measurement
(sampled every 8 px in a 2048 x 2048 px image) of % of area occupied by the
branches within a 50 x 50 µm2 square area, ignoring soma. Using these values a
heatmap was generated which shows absolute levels of density (up to 15%) in
assigned colors so that different images can be directly compared for their density
levels and distribution. To generate local density relative to distance from the soma,
the values from the heatmap were binned according to the distance from soma and
mean and standard deviation was calculated for each neuron. To calculate the
distribution of density values across the entire neuron, a custom Python script was
used to measure the area of receptive field of each neuron, and the number of pixels in
a given density (0-20%) in each neuron. For Sholl analysis, images containing a
single neuron was prepared as described above and Sholl Analysis ImageJ/Fiji plugin
was used at an interval of 5μm, starting from 10μm away from soma (Ferreira et al.,
2014).
Live imaging and quantitation of Rab4 and lysosomes in Drosophila larvae
Preparation of larvae for live imaging was largely performed as previously described
(Chen et al., 2016). Briefly, a drop of fresh 3% agarose in ddH2O was placed on a
slide and dried in the oven at 65°C overnight before use. A single larva was cleaned,
placed on the dried agarose patch, and gently squeezed by a coverslip (size #1,
Thorlab). This sandwich was held in place with sticky tape. Once mounted, the larva
was imaged within 45 minutes. Live imaging was performed using Nikon A1R pointscanning laser confocal microscope (x40 objective, oil, 1.3 NA, 200μm WD, CFI60
Plan Fluor). Nociceptive neurons were identified by their expression of ppkCD4tdGFP and a single image was collected as a reference map for the selection of ROIs.
ROIs (256 x 128 px) were selected to image ~50µm of primary dendrite at a Nyquist
resolution. For both Rab4 and Spinster, we chose our ROIs at primary branches
sufficiently away from soma, typically at around the first branch point (>100µm from
soma). A single section of this ROI was imaged at 1.1sec/frame, while manually

adjusting the focus when necessary to counter the minor movement of the animal.
Images were collected for up to 5 minutes depending on the stability of the mounted
larva. All images were randomized and blinded before any correction or
quantification. Images were corrected for minor movements using the Stackreg plugin
for ImageJ/Fiji. For quantification of Rab4, we used the Kymoanalyzer v.1 plugin for
ImageJ/Fiji (Neumann et al., 2017) without any modification to default settings,
except the threshold range for static vesicle was adjusted to avoid false positive
detection of trafficking due to the movement of animal. Upon quantification, a custom
R script was used to extract values from different measurements of Rab4 vesicles.
The extracted values included net vesicle population distribution (stationary,
anterograde, and retrograde), net velocity of vesicles in anterograde and retrograde
directions, switch frequency, and track density. For quantification of Spin vesicles,
20-second portion of each kymograph was selected and the fluorescent intensity of
this portion, representing the % of area occupied by lysosomes in the dendrite, was
measured in ImageJ/Fiji using the line plot tool. All values above 3000 a.u. (over
65535 a.u., in 16 bit) were binned as a maximum value, and the values were used to
plot a distribution curve. From here, area under the curve was calculated and
normalized by the length of the dendrite selected in the ROI.
Superresolution imaging and quantification of integrins and Rab4
Images were either collected by using a vt-iSIM (VisiTech International) (York et al.,
2013) mounted on DMi8 Leica microscope using 93x 1.3 NA HC PL APO glycerol
objective. Acquisitions included the cell body, axon and dendrites of ddaC neurons.
These images were subsequently deconvolved using Microvolution (20 iterations),
and were blinded prior to object analysis in Imaris (Oxford Instrument). Briefly, a
channel for the nociceptive neuron (ppkcd4tdgfp) was segmented to use as a mask to
isolate all neuronal puncta of integrins and Rab4. Smoothing (at 0.130 µm) and
background subtraction (at 3 µm) was performed. All voxels with intensity greater
than 482 a.u. (over 65535 a.u., 16 bit) in objects were filtered in, and objects smaller
than 200 voxels were excluded. Channels for integrin bPS (anti-bPS) and Rab4-YFP,
respectively, were segmented using background subtraction (at 0.5 µm). Intensity
threshold was set to 400 as a default choice for most samples but 600 or 850 a.u. was
also used depending on the fluorescent intensity of each sample. Objects were filtered

to exclude those with fewer than 10 voxels. Detected puncta were compartmentalized
into their locations in soma, dendrite, and axon via manual annotation of neuronal
surface into these three categories. Co-localization of puncta expressing both bPS and
Rab4 were detected by categorizing Rab4 positive objects into single (Rab4 alone) or
co-positive (Rab4 and integrins) structure.
Statistical analysis
Prism 8 was used for all statistical analysis and plotting data. Gaussian distribution
was determined by using D'Agostino and Pearson or Shaprio-Wilk normality test.
Depending on this result, either parametric or non-parametric test was selected for
each analysis. For comparing three or more groups, a post-test was performed to
correct for a multiple comparison to obtain an exact p-value. Detailed description of
statistical tests performed for each experiment is included in figure legends. Statistical
significance was determined at *p<0.05, **p<0.01, and ***p<0.001.

A-D. Examples of quantitative density heatmaps (A-C), and schematics illustrating the method of density analysis (D).

A-C. To obtain heatmaps, the density (% area covered by branches in surrounding area sized at 50 x 50μm2) was measured
every 2.5 μm (8 px in 2048 x 2048 image, also refer to method), resulted in 65536 measurement points (256 x 256) per
image obtained in our study. Most of the density values were lower than 15% (Figure 1D), therefore we assigned the color
for each measurement point corresponding to the scale of 0-15% to create a heatmap.
D. Simplified illustration of the density analysis. Here, we used weight score as a proxy for % of area covered by branches.
Dotted red boxes indicate each measurement point (15 x 15 measurement points in the first schematic), and the red boxes
refer to surrounding area (3 x 3 boxes) for a measurement point in the center. Each color-coded measurement point (dotted
red boxes) shows the density of a respective surrounding area, calculated according to the weight score and assigned for a
color that matches with the scale (high-med-low). Simulation of the density measurement of two measurement points are
illustrated in magnified images. Weight score of a surrounding area (red box, 3 x 3 boxes) for the first and the second
measurement points have density scores of 14 and 19. They are mid and mid-high densities for this schematic neuron,
therefore had been assigned with dark orange and yellow colors in the scale. The red box moves along the entire image to
calculate density for each measurement point to create a heatmap for an entire neuron.
