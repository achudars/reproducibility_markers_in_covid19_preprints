ABSTRACT

22

Measuring peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) with pulse oximeters at the point of care is widely established.

23

However, since SpO2 is dependent on ambient atmospheric pressure, the distribution of SpO2 values in populations

24

living above 2000 m a.s.l. is largely unknown. Here, we propose and evaluate a computer model to predict SpO2

25

values for pediatric permanent residents living between 0 and 4000 m a.s.l. Based on a sensitivity analysis of

26

oxygen transport parameters, we created an altitude-adaptive SpO2 model that takes physiological adaptation of

27

permanent residents into account. From this model, we derived an altitude-adaptive abnormal SpO2 threshold

28

using patient parameters from literature. We compared the obtained model and threshold against a previously

29

proposed threshold derived statistically from data and two empirical datasets independently recorded from

30

Peruvian children living at altitudes up to 4100 m a.s.l. Our model followed the trends of empirical data, with the

31

empirical data having a narrower healthy SpO2 range below 2000 m a.s.l., but the medians did never differ more

32

than 2.29% across all altitudes. Our threshold estimated abnormal SpO2 in only 17 out of 5981 (0.3%) healthy

33

recordings, whereas the statistical threshold returned 95 (1.6%) recordings outside the healthy range. The strength

34

of our parametrised model is that it is rooted in physiology-derived equations and enables customisation.

35

Furthermore, as it provides a reference SpO2, it could assist practitioners in interpreting SpO2 values for diagnosis,

36

prognosis, and oxygen administration at higher altitudes.

37

New & Noteworthy

38

Our model describes the altitude-dependent decrease of SpO2 in healthy pediatric residents based on physiological

39

equations and can be adapted based on measureable clinical parameters. The proposed altitude-specific abnormal

40

SpO2 threshold might be more appropriate than rigid guidelines for administering oxygen that currently are only

41

available for sea level patients. We see this as a starting point to discuss and adapt oxygen administration

42

guidelines.

INTRODUCTION

45

Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are a major health burden in low- and middle-income countries.

46

Childhood pneumonia accounts for 14% of all deaths in children worldwide under five years of age (45), of which

47

95 % occur in low resource settings (41). Common conditions observed in ALRI are dyspnoea and hypoxemia, an

48

abnormally low level of oxygen saturation in the arterial blood (SaO2), that can lead to cyanosis and subsequently

49

to death (43). A rapid and non-invasive estimation of hypoxemia can be obtained through pulse oximetry that

50

measures peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2). Pulse oximetry has become a suitable technology for application in

51

low resource settings due to the simplicity of use in combination with mobile phones and non-invasiveness of the

52

device (20, 27). The use of pulse oximeters and supplemental oxygen in clinical applications at the point of care

53

has shown to drastically reduce death rates (8). However, in countries where these devices are needed most,

54

health personnel have only slowly started to gain access.

55

The interpretation of SpO2 values for hypoxemia is challenging, especially for health personnel not familiar with

56

respiratory physiology and measurement principles of pulse oximeters. The World Health Organization (WHO)

57

recommends the administration of oxygen when SpO2 drops below or is equal to 90% (44). This fixed threshold

58

oversimplifies hypoxemia treatment (7). It does not provide an indication on when to stop treatment and does not

59

permit adaptation to the local conditions. Namely, in many rural areas, oxygen is a scarce and precious resource

60

and therefore only restrictively administered. Altitude has a direct influence on SpO2 as the air pressure decreases,

61

and consequently, the alveolar oxygen partial pressure decreases with increasing altitude (43). Thus, the treatment

62

of ALRI (i.e. administration of oxygen), diagnosis and prognosis, might be affected at higher altitudes and the

63

recommended oxygen administration guidelines at sea level may not be applicable. However, before determining

64

treatment thresholds at higher altitudes, healthy values in this environment need to be established.

65

In this work, we introduce an altitude-adaptive SpO2 model and propose a model-derived altitude-adaptive

66

abnormal SpO2 threshold. The physiology-backed altitude-adaptive model describes SpO2 values of healthy

67

children living permanently at altitudes up to 4000 m a.s.l. With this model, we aim to provide a better

68

understanding of healthy SpO2 values at altitudes above 2000 m a.s.l. for healthy children. The altitude-adaptive

69

abnormal SpO2 threshold is obtained by setting the model parameters to abnormal values found in hypoxemic

70

patients. We evaluate these results with a novel dataset obtained from healthy children living in the rural Andes

71

of Peru.

Related Work

73

The current literature presents two modelling approaches that describe the relationship between SpO2 and

74

altitude.

75

Subhi et al. developed a statistical model of the SpO2 distribution across altitudes that is based on empirical

76

observations from healthy children, and derived an altitude-adaptive threshold for hypoxemia from this model

77

(40). Data were obtained through a literature review of studies performed between 0 and 4018 m a.s.l. A linear

78

random effects meta-regression was performed to predict mean and 2.5th centile SpO2 with an exponential

79

equation. This 2.5th centile of healthy children’s SpO2 at each altitude was proposed as an altitude-adjusted

80

hypoxemia threshold. It is unclear why this specific, statistically derived threshold was chosen. The obtained

81

statistical model and threshold also did not take other influencing factors, such as measurement protocols, choice

82

of oximeter technology, ethnicity and age range of the studied subjects, into account.

83

Our group developed a computer model that described the pathway of oxygen throughout the cardio-respiratory

84

body compartments (24, 25). It implemented the oxygen cascade described by West (43). The model used well-

85

established physiological equations to explain how the partial oxygen pressure and oxygen concentrations are

86

interrelated between alveolar gas and peripheral blood (24) (Figure 1). The oxygen cascade describes the oxygen

87

loss from the partial pressure of inspired air to the resulting measurements of SpO2 by a pulse oximeter. Therefore,

88

the model was based on physiological parameters and integrated pulse oximeter measurement inaccuracies as

89

reported by the manufacturer. A shortcoming of the model was that it assumed many physiological parameters to

90

be constant and therefore did not consider altitude adaptation. Consequently, it could not correctly describe SpO2

91

measured at higher altitudes, especially in people adapted to these conditions such as permanent residents.

92

In a recent prospective study, Rojas-Camayo et al. recorded SpO2 from 6289 subjects ranging from infants to elderly

93

people in the Peruvian Andes at 15 altitudes from 154 m to 5100 m a.s.l. (36). They reported the 2.5th, 10th, 25th ,

94

50th, 75th, 90th and 97.5th centile of the empirical data. This data has not been used to derive a hypoxemia threshold

95

thus far.

MODELLING

97

Altitude-adaptive SpO2 model

98

Starting from the previously established computer model of the oxygen cascade (24), we modified this model to

99

include physiological adaptation to high altitudes. We adjusted parameters that had been found to change with

100

altitude in permanent residents (see Table 1 for an overview of all parameters used). Briefly, the existing model of

101

the oxygen cascade described the pathway of oxygen throughout the cardio-respiratory body compartments

102

(Figure 1) by using physiological equations (see appendix). The model was originally developed to estimate the

103

“virtual shunt” (VS) describing the overall loss of oxygen content between the alveolar gas and arterial blood

104

compartments (2), with SpO2 and inspired oxygen (FiO2) values as input parameters. An increase in the VS is one

105

of the main causes of hypoxemia (43).

106

The above mentioned oxygen cascade model, originally developed for adults, can be adapted to a pediatric model

107

as there are no indications that the underlying physics of gas exchange are any different in children (28). We

108

identified relationships between altitude adaptation and parameters of the oxygen cascade, such as atmospheric

109

pressure, haemoglobin concentration (cHb), alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pACO2), and the

110

respiratory quotient (RQ). In addition, we devided VS into two components (Figure 1): 1) incomplete capillary

111

diffusion (diffusion defect between the alveolar and capillary , VSdiff) and 2) incomplete perfusion with

112

intrapulmonary shunt (perfusion defect, VSperf).

113

We made the following assumptions for the model of a healthy subject: there is no oxygen loss between the alveoli

114

and the end-capillaries (no incomplete capillary diffusion, VSdiff=0) and SpO2 is equal to SaO2 (24). These

115

assumptions had the following consequences: the alveolar oxygen partial pressure (pAO2) is equal to the partial

116

pressure of oxygen in the end capillaries , the alveolar oxygen saturation is equal to the end capillaries oxygen

117

saturation, and the oxygen content in the alveoli is the same as the in the end capillaries. For the parameters cHb

118

and RQ, we extracted the healthy values at two altitudes (0 m and 4600 m a.s.l.) from the literature (31, 32, 43)

119

and linearly interpolated the parameters between these two altitudes. A linear interpolation was chosen because

120

a sensitivity analysis revealed only small changes upon variation of these parameters (see appendix). For high

121

altitudes (i.e. 4600 m a.s.l.), pACO2 was derived from an interpolation of values reported by Rahn and Otis (35), as

122

well as de Meer (32) because the literature presented less coherent values; while for sea level, direct values from

123

Marcdante (30) and West (43) were used. With this information, the oxygen cascade enabled us to estimate the

124

expected SpO2 range at a specific altitude. Furthermore, we incorporated the technical tolerances that accounted

125

for the accuracy of pulse oximeters (i.e. ± 2%) determined according to device standards (21) into the model, as

126

shown in Karlen et al. (24). The pulse oximeter accuracy is an important component that is frequently neglected

127

by health practitioners, but influences the pulse oximeter readings and therefore diagnostic results. We include

128

this uncertainty in our model as we strive to better describe the physiology of lung function at different altitudes.

129

Therefore, in the following, when we mention the “healthy ranges”, we refer to the physiological ranges obtained

130

by modelling SpO2 based on minimum and maximum literature values of the physiological parameters, combined

131

with the pulse oximeter inaccuracies.

132

Altitude-adaptive abnormal SpO2 threshold

133

Analogously, we derive an altitude-dependent threshold for abnormal SpO2 by setting model parameters to

134

hypoxemia levels. Hypoxemia is defined as a reduced arterial partial pressure of oxygen (paO2), which results in a

135

decrease of SpO2 and increase of VS (43). At sea level, as reported in literature, we consider a patient to have

136

hypoxemia if the paO2 level is below 80 mmHg (3, 26) and therefore SpO2 decreases below 95%. Additionally, we

137

assumed that VSperf increases to above 5%. patients (31). From these assumptions, we recursively derived a disease

138

related increase of VSdiff of 19% at sea level. For higher altitudes, we were unable to retrieve any data from the

139

literature that would describe changes (increase or decrease) in VS (VSdiff or VSperf) or a numerical value for paO2

140

or pAO2 under hypoxemia. Therefore, we assumed that the VS components remain constant across altitudes, and

141

the values for cHb, pACO2, and RQ are similar in healthy and hypoxemic conditions.

142

MATERIALS AND METHODS

143

To assess the performance and plausibility of our novel altitude-adaptive SpO2 model and threshold, we

144

retrospectively evaluated them against a prospectively collected dataset, a previously published dataset, and

145

another, statistical model with threshold.

Cajabamba. Our study harnessed the operational and logistical setup of this trial, which assessed the efficacy of an

150

Integrated Home-environmental Intervention Package (IHIP-2) to improve child respiratory, enteric, and early

151

development outcomes (19).

152

The trial was approved by the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia ethical review board and the Cajamarca

153

Regional Health Authority. The trial was registered on the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN26548981). A total of 317

154

children aged between 6 and 36 months were enrolled, and informed written consent was obtained from the

155

children’s guardians. A total of 9 field workers (FWs) were trained to visit the children on seven fixed geographical

156

routes. Children were preassigned to these routes and visited in parallel by FWs to perform a mobile health

157

assessment once a week over the course of 60 weeks (6 weeks pilot, followed by a 54-week trial from February

158

2016 to May 2017, excluding 4 weeks of public holidays). FWs had experience from earlier research projects in

159

collecting basic vital signs and symptoms (17, 18), received five additional days of educational training for the

160

collection of morbidity data, and underwent one month of practical training before the study started (pilot). FWs

161

were equipped with a TAB 2 A7-10 tablet (Lenovo Group Ltd, Beijing, CN). The tablet had a custom mHealth app

162

installed that was developed using the lambdanative framework (34). It recorded a photoplethysmogram (PPG)

163

using an USB connected CE marked iSpO2 Rx pulse oximeter (Masimo International, Neuchatel, CH) with a multisite

164

Y-probe, and derived SpO2 and heart rate (HR). FWs placed the probe on the child’s thumb, index finger, or sole of

165

the foot for the measurement of PPG, HR, and SpO2. Simultaneously, respiratory rate was recorded using the RRate

166

app module (22). In addition, the app acquired location and altitude using the embedded global positioning system

167

(GPS) sensor. Furthermore, the app metadata regarding the visit and the recordings such as child ID, timestamps,

168

and child agitation during the vital signs measurements were acquired. All electronically collected data was

169

uploaded from the app into a digital research database (16). Health seeking behaviour and other relevant

170

endpoints were reported in a paper-based, validated questionnaire (18), quality checked, and digitised at the end

171

of the study.

172

Post processing

173

The IHIP-2 vital signs data obtained from the pulse oximeter were post processed to guarantee high data quality.

174

The PPG, SpO2, HR, and perfusion index (PI, indication of signal strength) time series from the main trial period

175

were imported into Matlab (R2017b, MathWorks Inc., Natick, USA) where a signal quality index (SQI) for the PPG

176

was calculated (23). We segmented the recordings into segments with SQI > 45. Segments with lower quality (SQI

177

≤ 45) and with no computed SpO2 were excluded. Furthermore, entire recordings were excluded if a single segment

178

duration was shorter than 12 s or the combined length of remaining segments was shorter than 15 s, the range

179

(5th - 95th centile) of SpO2 exceeded 5%, and the HR range surpassed 20 bpm in combination with a low perfusion

180

(mean PI ≤ 0.8). We also excluded SpO2 values below 60% as they are rare and typically associated with severe

181

clinical cyanosis (46), which was clearly absent in the IHIP-2 cohort. These values also fall in a range where the

182

performance of the pulse oximeters used were not specified by the manufacturer (70% to 100%). Additionally, as

183

each child was always scheduled to be measured weekly at the same altitude (i.e. at home), we verified the

184

consistency of the altitude provided by the GPS. We excluded recordings that contained no altitude information,

185

and altitude outliers that were more than three scaled median absolute deviations away from the median altitude

186

of each child. Altitude outliers could have occurred because at home measurements were not always possible, and

187

because GPS altitude estimates were dependent on weather, the number of available satellites, and other factors.

188

Finally, we excluded measurements which were recorded following a healthcare center visit or the presence of

189

cardio-respiratory or diarrheal disease symptoms in the week preceding the recording. For each remaining high

190

quality recording, we reported the median SpO2 over the combined segments of a measurement and the median

altitude per child, which was then used for the analysis.

208

the number of measurements in the healthy IHIP-2 data that would have been wrongly classified as abnormal

209

(false positives) when using either the altitude-adaptive abnormal SpO2 threshold or the statistical hypoxemia

210

threshold. The false positives are children that are healthy, but likely would receive additional medical attention

211

due to the low SpO2 reading.

212

RESULTS

213

We obtained an altitude-adaptive computer model to describe the expected SpO2 range in healthy children at

214

higher altitudes, and based on this model proposed a threshold for an abnormal range that could indicate

215

hypoxemia. The parameters used in the mathematical description of the model to define healthy and abnormal

216

ranges are available in Table 1. Out of the 12634 SpO2 measurements obtained from 310 children over the course

217

of a year, we retained 5981 measurements from 297 children that were considered complete (contained both GPS

218

and PPG data), featured good quality PPG data, reasonable SpO2 (> 60 %) and were recorded when no respiratory

219

disease symptoms or other health issues were reported (410 recordings). At the study start, the mean age of the

220

children was 20.5 months (SD 6.2 months, range: 6-36 months). Each child contributed to a mean of 20.1 (SD 9)

221

repeated measurements. Twenty-one children lived above 3000 m a.s.l. and 8 above 3500 m a.s.l. (Table 2).

222

Therefore, a total of 392 (6.6%) measurements above 3000 m a.s.l. were available.

223

Model

224

Our altitude-adaptive model provided a SpO2 of 97.4% at sea level with a healthy range between 93.5 % and 100%

225

SpO2 (Figure 2 and Table 3, high resolution data including model available at (11)). The SpO2 of the model decreased

226

with increasing altitude to 89.6% at 4000 m a.s.l. with a healthy SpO2 range from 82.3% to 94.1%. The 2.5th and

227

97.5th centiles reported by Rojas-Camayo et al. largely followed the same trend as those acquired in the IHIP-2

228

trial, but had a smaller absolute range (Figure 2). Up to 3800 m a.s.l., the 2.5th centiles of both empirical data sets

229

were entirely within the lower boundary of the altitude-adaptive SpO2 model’s proposed healthy range, whereas

230

at higher altitudes above 3800 m a.s.l., the 2.5th centile of the IHIP-2 data slightlyfell below this lower boundary.

231

The upper boundary of the altitude-apdaptive SpO2 model’s healthy range followed the IHIP-2 data 97.5th centile

232

closely, while it was slightly exceeded by the 97.5th centile data from Rojas-Camayo et al. between 1500 and

233

3100 m a.s.l by up 0.5 %. In particular, the model showed absolute ranges very similar to both empiricial lowess

242

The 2.5th centile threshold explored by Subhi et al. had an SpO2 of 92.8% at 2000 m a.s.l. and then rapidly diverged

243

towards much lower SpO2 values for higher altitudes (75.4% at 4000 m a.s.l.). When comparing the two thresholds

244

and their performance for our empirical dataset, the altitude-adaptive threshold estimated abnormal SpO2 in only

245

17 out of 5981 (0.3%) healthy recordings, whereas the 2.5th centile threshold explored by Subhi et al. returned 95

(1.6%) false positives.

altitude and have shown that this proposed healthy SpO2 range matches empirical data recorded from a pediatric

250

population living in the Andes. From this model, we derived an altitude-adaptive threshold for abnormal SpO2

251

values. The diagnosis of pneumonia and other respiratory diseases is challenging at altitude, as the most common

252

diagnostic criteria, such as the respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, are dependent on altitude. Our work

253

contributes towards making the management of childhood pneumonia, one of the major causes of child mortality

254

in low resource settings, more objective by attempting to better describe healthy changes of respiratory physiology

255

found in adapted residents. Equipping health workers with mobile pulse oximeters has become an affordable

256

solution, is being evaluated at a large scale (29), and has potential for improving pneumonia treatment at a

257

reasonable cost (12). However, the measurement and interpretation of SpO2 can be complicated. Computerised

258

assistance and interpretation of the measurements could ensure reliability of these measurements and provide a

259

meaningful decision support tool to health workers at the central and peripheral level. The proposed adaptive,

260

physiology-based model could provide a basis for the necessary computations because it provides a reference for

261

healthy values at higher altitudes.

The altitude-adaptive abnormal SpO2 threshold followed a similar pattern as the 2.5th centile of Rojas-Camayo’s

262

Our model is unique as the adjustment of the parameters can be tuned individually, based either on measurements

263

or on known parameter ranges, and it is based on physiology. It was developed considering, where available,

264

literature-based physiological parameter values of Peruvian Andes residents that are adapted to this environment.

265

These parameters could be adjusted without altering the underlying model for other populations with known

266

differences in genetic or physiological adaptation mechanisms (e.g. Himalayan residents) (1).

267

In contrast to our parameterized model, Subhi and colleagues fitted empirical data collected from across the world

268

into a statistical model describing the SpO2 distribution using centiles (40). The statistical model was built using

269

aggregated data collected from mixed populations using pulse oximeters with partially unknown specifications.

270

The statistical model therefore cannot be adjusted to factors such as population-specific variations or varying

271

technical specifications (e.g. differing accuracy of pulse oximeter brands or types). In relation to the two empirical

272

data sets mentioned in this publication, and in comparison to our proposed abnormal SpO2 threshold, the

273

statistical threshold provided a very sensitive cut-off at lower altitudes (up to 3300 m a.s.l.). However, it

274

underestimates potentially abnormal SpO2 values at higher altitudes. Most likely, this underestimation of the

275

abnormal SpO2 values at higher altitudes is due to less data samples being available for the statistical modeling.

276

Our physiological model was not affected by data sparsity, which is a distinctive feature and clear advantage at

277

higher altitudes. Both model thresholds, and the studied data sets, supported the current WHO constant threshold

278

of 90% SpO2 for oxygen administration at altitudes below 1500 m a.s.l.

279

The altitude-adaptive model described the SpO2 ranges observed from the empirical data sets with highly similar

280

mean absolute ranges., However, the two empirical datasets presented in this work originate solely from the

281

Peruvian Andes and a single type of pulse oximeter. To further validate the model, it will be crucial to apply data

282

from other regions and ethnicities, and establish if a customised model is required when used in different parts of

283

the world. Such data collection should be accompanied by a gold standard, such as blood gas measurements with

284

information on cHb, SaO2, paO2 and paCO2, in order to pinpoint the exact sources of potentially observed

285

differences.

286

At higher altitudes above 3800 m a.s.l., we notice higher deviations in the model compared to what is seen in the

287

empirical data due to a slower decline of SpO2 in the model. We suspect that this is directly linked to the

288

assumptions we made during the modelling of healthy ranges. We assumed that cHb and RQ change linearly with

289

altitude. However, the adaptation process is likely more pronounced at higher altitudes (6) and might contribute

290

to non-linear parameter changes.

291

Our assumptions to define the abnormal physiological parameters could limit the validity of the abnormal

292

threshold. We only based our assumptions on literature values that referred to sea level patients. Due to the

293

underlying changes in physiology caused by adaptation, disease manifestation and progression, symptoms could

294

be different at high altitudes compared to at sea level. Furthermore, it is unclear if comorbidities that have not

295

been captured in the present modelling, such as malnutrition, iron deficiency, or diarrheal diseases that are known

296

to negatively influence outcomes of patients with pneumonia (4, 37, 39), would also influence the model

297

parameters. Additional empirical data of sick children are needed to establish models that describe the

298

dependence of these parameters to altitude. For example, anaemic children display altered ranges for blood gas

299

parameters and their actual health status is not entirely captured through our cardio-respiratory model based on

300

SpO2 measurements. SpO2 and derived hypoxemia estimations reflect only the proportion of O2 that is bound to

301

Hb and not the total O2 carrying capacity and concentration. Consequently, pulse oximeter assessments are blind

302

to the effective O2 available in the tissues. Also, cardiac output, an alternative path to modulate O2 delivery (14),

303

is not easily obtainable with pulse oximetry alone. Thus, clinicians need to take the overall clinical situation of the

304

child into consideration and evaluate treatment options accordingly when interpreting hypoxemia thresholds (10).

305

To assess the performance of the model, we limited the comparison to altitudes from 2000 to 4000 m a.s.l. where

306

corresponding empirical data was available. The data contained weekly measurements for each child repeated

307

over a full year (mean: 20.1, SD: 9), therefore representing the expected measurement and physiological variability

308

within a healthy subject. Among the children recruited from the Cajamarca region during the IHIP-2 trial, only 21

309

lived above 3000 m a.s.l. which increases the variability in the data. Nevertheless, we observed very similar SpO2

310

ranges from Rojas-Camayo et al. (36). Despite the high numbers of repeated measurements and rigid

311

measurement protocols, both datasets showed a high variability in the measured SpO2. For example, in the IHIP-2

312

dataset, at 2000 m a.s.l. a healthy range corresponded to 11% (Table 2). Our model represented this large range

313

of possible healthy values accurately. Nevertheless, the inter- and intra-individual variability could originate from

314

a number of sources not incorporated in the model. Circadian variation in pediatric SpO2 has been reported (42)

315

and we did not account for such daytime differences. Furthermore, there are known sex differences in adults (1),

316

which could also apply to the pediatric population. Although we used the most recent pulse oximeter technology

317

and performed continuous measurements for at least a minute with a rigorous approach to PPG post-processing

318

for high quality, not all the sources for measurement errors in pulse oximetry, such as poor perfusion, inacurate

319

probe positioning, or ambient light interference (13), could be fully excluded in this dataset.

320

Additionally, it is important to note that neonates were not considered in the modeling process. Neonatal blood is

321

known to benefit from the high affinity of fetal haemoglobin and would have changed the oxygen dissociation

322

curve considerably (33). Since hyperoxia in neonates leads to oxidative stress with potentially severe health

323

complications (15), the definition of an abnormal threshold and consequently the guideline for oxygen

324

administration would require a more detailed, separate discussion for this population.

325

We established an altitude-adaptive abnormal SpO2 threshold based on physiologically plausible values. Our

326

results show that using such a threshold is most relevant at altitudes above 2000 m a.s.l. The 90% SpO2 threshold

327

recommended by the WHO for oxygen administration in patients living at sea level clearly does not apply to these

328

altitudes. Compared to the previously published statistical altitude-dependent threshold by Subhi et al. (40), our

329

threshold leads to fewer detections of false positives (healthy children falsely categorized as hypoxemic).

330

Conversely, while Subhi et al. also promoted the use of an altitude-dependent threshold at higher altitudes

331

(2500 m a.s.l.), their threshold is very conservative at altitudes below 2950 m a.s.l. but more lenient at higher

332

altitudes, where it decreases very steeply which might exclude a number of patients in need of supplemental

333

oxygen.

334
335

Outlook

336

To date, no reliable SpO2 data from children suffering from hypoxemia and ALRI at altitude are available. The

337

advancement of research for developing better tools to diagnose pneumonia and ALRI at altitude would greatly

338

benefit from access to publicly available, comprehensive data sets obtained from sick children.

339

With pulse oximeters increasingly being used as monitors for ALRI diagnosis and treatment, additional research is

340

urgently needed to provide a reliable description of the SpO2 distribution at altitude, and to develop guidelines of

341

oxygen administration for hypoxemic children living in these settings.

342

Furthermore, knowledge of abnormal SpO2 values at high altitudes could help in the development of new decision

343

support tools for health workers operating in low resource settings with the goal to improve clinical management

344

of hypoxemia in children with ALRI in the future.

Thus far, experts have not agreed on a definition for abnormal SpO2 thresholds at altitudes higher than sea level.

CONCLUSION

346

Improvement of SpO2-altitude models present a first step towards an integration of pulse oximetry in low resource

347

settings and could further the development of valid altitude-dependent thresholds for treatment of childhood

348

pneumonia and other ALRI. We developed an altitude-adaptive physiology-backed SpO2 model using an existing

349

physiological model using the concept of VS adjusted for published ranges of values for pACO2, cHb, and RQ. Based

350

on this model, healthy ranges and an altitude-dependent abnormal SpO2 threshold are suggested that are based

351

on physiological variations of vital parameters. With the increased availability of sensors and digitalised systems in

352

low resource settings, parametrised models could provide additional valuable support to primary health workers

353

to understand the patient’s condition at the point of care, and choosing treatment options based on objectively

354

obtained physiological measurements.

Sensitivity analysis
To display the influence of parameters on the output of the oxygen cascade, a sensitivity analysis was
performed (Figure A1). The parameters variation was chosen to reproduce the minimum and maximum
value used in the altitude-adaptive SpO2 model (Table 1). A change in pACO2 had the highest effect,
followed by VSdiff, VSperf and RQ. A change in cHb is negligible for the calculation of SpO2, however, please
note that it has a significant influence on availability of O2 in the tissues.
