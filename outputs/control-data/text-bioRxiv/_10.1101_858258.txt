Granger et al. Uncinate fasciculus integrity and emotional pattern separation
Abstract:
Alterations in white matter integrity have been demonstrated in a number of psychiatric disorders
that involve disruptions in emotional processing. One such pathway – the uncinate fasciculus (UF)
– connects the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to the medial temporal lobes (MTL) and has been
associated with early life adversity, maltreatment, anxiety, and depression. While it is purported
to play a role in episodic memory and discrimination, its exact function remains poorly understood.
We have previously described the role of the amygdala and dentate (DG)/CA3 fields of the
hippocampus in the mnemonic discrimination of emotional experiences (i.e. emotional pattern
separation). However, how this computation may be modulated by connectivity between the
medial temporal lobes and the orbitofrontal cortex remains unknown. Here we ask the question
of whether the uncinate fasciculus plays a role in influencing MTL subregional activity during
emotional pattern separation. By combining diffusion imaging with high-resolution functional MRI,
we found that reduced integrity of the UF is related to higher activation in the DG/CA3 subregions
of the hippocampus during an emotional pattern separation task. We additionally report that
higher levels of DG/CA3 activity are associated with poorer memory performance, suggesting that
hyperexcitability in this network (which may be driven by CA3 recurrent collaterals) is associated
with memory errors and that the UF may allow the OFC to exert inhibitory control on this network
and improve discrimination of emotional experiences. This work provides novel mechanistic
insight into the role of prefrontal interactions with the MTL, particularly in the context of emotional
memory.

Granger et al. Uncinate fasciculus integrity and emotional pattern separation
Introduction
Episodic memory – memory for facts and events that shape our lives – involves contributions from
the medial temporal lobe (MTL) as well as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as their interactions
(Eichenbaum, 2017; Preston & Eichenbaum, 2013). While a considerable imaging literature in
humans has focused on the hippocampus, relatively few studies have examined the role of white
matter pathways connecting the MTL to the PFC in supporting episodic memory computations.
Studies in rodents have been hindered by the major species differences in PFC anatomy as well
as the absence of certain anatomical connections that are present in primates.
One such anatomical connection, the uncinate fasciculus (UF), is a major white matter bundle
connecting the MTL to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in primates. This particular connection forms
an “anterior pathway” by which the MTL can communicate with the PFC and has been thought of
as a top-down regulator involved in fear-related memory processes (Marek et al., 2018). In
humans, deficits in the UF have been implicated in psychiatric disorders characterized by
emotional dysregulation such as major depression and anxiety, as well as in early life stress and
maltreatment (Taylor et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012; Eluvathingal et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2017;
Hanson et al., 2015). Although often described as innervating the hippocampus, human dissection
and axonal tracing studies in primates have indicated that this bundle more accurately innervates
the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the entorhinal cortices of the MTL (Ebeling and Von Cramon,
1992; Von der Hide et al., 2013; Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2012). Further, the UF has distinct
projections to a number of prefrontal areas in particular the OFC (Fig. 1).

Fig 1. Circuitry of orbitofrontal connectivity with the medial temporal lobe subfields via the uncinate fasciculus. The
uncinate innervates both the lateral amygdala and cortices of the MTL. The cortices of the MTL feed into the
hippocampal subfields of DG, CA3, and CA1 via multiple pathways one of which includes the perforant path. The
perforant path feeds into the DG/CA3 subfields where the neuronal computation known as pattern separation is thought
to occur. In this manner, the uncinate fasciculus is a possible direct route of inhibitory information to these regions.

While the exact functional role of the UF remains unclear, it is thought to be involved in episodic
memory, language, and socio-emotional processing (Von Der Heide et al., 2013). The UF is also
hypothesized to play a role in adjudicating among competing episodic memory representations at
retrieval, a hypothesis which has gained some recent empirical support (Alm et al., 2016).
Competition among memory traces during retrieval could be mediated, at least in part, by pattern
separation. This computation, as first suggested by Marr (Marr, 1971), is defined as the neural
computation used to orthogonalize overlapping similar stimuli, a process that particularly involves
the dentate gyrus and CA3 regions of the hippocampus (Yassa & Stark, 2011; Leal and Yassa
2018). Given this prior work, we reasoned that tasks assessing pattern separation would be
particularly well-suited to understanding the impact of the UF connection on episodic memory.

Granger et al. Uncinate fasciculus integrity and emotional pattern separation
High-resolution fMRI studies have noted pattern-separation related activity in the DG/CA3 region
during incidental encoding of similar lure items (Bakker et al. 2008; Lacy et al. 2011) as well as
explicit performance of mnemonic discrimination tasks (Yassa et al. 2010a, 2010b; Reagh et al.
2018). These tasks require participants to determine during retrieval if items highly similar to the
previously encoded items are “new” or “old”. This challenging discrimination procedure requires
suppression of interference from competing memory representations. In the context of emotional
memories, this network extends to also include the amygdala (Leal et al. 2014b). We recently
showed using intracranial recordings from presurgical epilepsy patients that alpha-band mediated
unidirectional influence of the amygdala on the DG/CA3 during an emotional mnemonic
discrimination task is associated with overgeneralization errors (Zheng et al. 2018). This suggests
that MTL computations can be biased to discriminate or generalize across similar experience but
the role of the PFC or MTL-PFC connections in setting this bias is unclear.

Fig 2. Schematic of the emotional pattern separation task. BOLD activity from DG/CA3, CA1, and amygdala. The left
side of the image shows the incidental encoding phase of the task where participants are asked to rate images as
“negative”, “neutral”, or “positive”. On the right side of the image is the memory portion of the task. This phase, known
as the Old/New Recognition phase shows participants several variants of previously seen images (lures), as well as
repeated images (repeats), and never before seen images (foils). Subjects are asked to make “old” or “new” judgements
during the trial and response times are recorded.

As one of the major structural pathways connecting the MTL and the PFC, the UF is a likely
contributor to the process of emotional memory discrimination. However, its role in this process
has never before been investigated. Using multimodal neuroimaging, we tested the hypothesis
that the UF regulates mnemonic discrimination specifically for emotional items by altering BOLD
fMRI activity in the DG/CA3 activity, which in turn would predict emotional discrimination
performance. To assess the structural role of the UF, we implement a novel way to anatomically
track the pathway using non-tensor-based or “model free” diffusion weighted imaging and
deterministic tractography (Yeh et al., 2013). We quantified the integrity of the UF by utilizing a
model-free diffusion metric (normalized quantitative anisotropy – nQA) which is designed to
capture the degree of diffusion among primary fiber orientations accounting for partial volume
effects indicative of the tensor model (Yeh et al., 2013). To assess the functional role of the
DG/CA3 region of the hippocampus, we used high-resolution (1.5mm isotropic) BOLD fMRI
capable of resolving hippocampal subfields, while participants performed the emotional

discrimination index”, a measure of how well participants are able to discriminate among similar
emotional and neutral scenes, corrected for response bias.

Uncinate Integrity Predicts DG/CA3 Activity During Emotional Lure
To test the hypothesis that UF structural integrity is associated with MTL subregional activation
profiles during discrimination of highly similar lures, we used normalized quantitative anisotropy
(nQA) to quantify the UF and BOLD fMRI activity in the DG/CA3 region during correct
discrimination as our variables of interest. Here we separately assessed the magnitude of this
relationship (between UF integrity and DG/CA3 activity) in highly similar negative, neutral, and
positive correct discrimination trials. We focused on high-similarity lures as prior work suggested
that DG/CA3 activity is particularly sensitive to this condition (Leal et al. 2014b). We found a
significant negative correlation between left UF nQA and left DG/CA3 activity for highly similar
negative (n = 27, Pearson r = -0.4067, P = 0.0353) and positive (n = 27, Pearson r = -0.4385, P
= 0.0221) but not neutral (n = 27, Pearson r = 0.1206, P = 0.5491) CRs (Fig 3a-c).

We then tested if this the relationship between UF integrity and DG/CA3 activity during lure
discrimination was specific to the DG/CA3 subfield of the hippocampus. We found that that left
UF nQA did not predict with the responses of the left CA1 subfield. Additionally, these effects

Granger et al. Uncinate fasciculus integrity and emotional pattern separation
seem specific to the left hemisphere. Right UF integrity did not predict right DG/CA3 nor CA1
activity during highly similar lure discrimination for any valence type. All p-values were above .05.
To further test the specificity of UF nQA predicting DG/CA3 activity during highly similar emotional
lure discrimination, we tested if UF nQA also predicted DG/CA3 activity during low similarity lure
correct rejection. Left UF nQA did not predict DG/CA3 activity for negative (n = 27, Pearson r =
0.0838, P = 0.6775), neutral (n = 27, Pearson r = 0.214, P = 0.283), or positive (n = 27, Pearson
r = 0.152, P = 0.4487) low similarity correct rejections.
As the UF has been previously implicated in psychiatric disorders characterized by emotional
disturbances, we asked if this effect could be related to symptoms of depression. Using the Beck
Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) we quantified depressive symptoms in all participants and
included the overall score in a regression model (BDI-II and UF nQA predicting DG/CA3 activity).
We found that the relationship between left UF nQA and left DG/CA3 activity for highly similar
negative lure correct discrimination trials remained significant (B = -1.8026, p-value= 0.0481) after
accounting for BDI-II scores (B = -0.002863, p-value = 0.4555). Similarly, the relationship between
left UF nQA and left DG/CA3 activity for highly similarly positive items remained significant (B = 1.941544, p-value 0.03220) after accounting for BDI-II scores (B = -0.004507, p-value = 0.23795).
To determine if this relationship was specific to the UF or is a general feature of white matter
connectivity, we tested the relationship between general connectivity and DG/CA3 activity (using
the corpus callosum as a control pathway). We tested the hypothesis that the corpus callosum
nQA predicted averaged DG/CA3 response during high similarity negative, positive and neutral
lures. We found that none of the relationships were statistically significant (Fig 3d-f). Together,
these data suggest that lower integrity of the UF is associated with higher levels of activity in the
DG/CA3 during correct discrimination, suggesting a possible role in inhibiting or limiting the
excitability of this subregion, and that this effect is specific to the UF and is not a general
characteristic of other white matter.

DG/CA3 Functional Activity Predicts Lure Discrimination
Next, we assessed the relationship between DG/CA3 subfield activity during discrimination of
highly similar lure was associated with overall performance on those trial types. Past work in our
group and others has suggested that higher levels of activity in the DG/CA3 region is associated
with overgeneralization errors. We found a significant negative correlation between left DG/CA3
activity during correct discrimination of negative stimuli and the lure discrimination index on the

same trials (n = 27, Pearson r = -0.4205, p-value = 0.029, Fig. 4). We once again assessed
whether depressive symptoms impacted this relationship by including BDI-II score as a regressor
and found that that the relationship between left DG/CA3 activity and negative LDI remained
significant (B = -0.313636455, p-value = 0.0399) accounting for depressive symptoms (B =
0.0008924, p-value = 0.7633).
DG/CA3 Functional Activity Mediates the Association Between the Uncinate Fasciculus and Lure
Discrimination
Given the relationship between the UF and DG/CA3 activity, as well as the relationship between
DG/CA3 activity and lure discrimination performance, we asked whether UF integrity directly
predicts lure discrimination. We found no significant correlations between left UF nQA and LDI of
highly similar negative (n = 27, Pearson r = 0.2359, p-value = 0.2362), neutral (n = 27, r = -0.1288,
p-value = 0.5220), or positive items (n = 27, Pearson r = 0.2423, p-value = 0.2233). We also found
no significant correlations between right UF nQA and LDI of highly similar negative (n = 27,
Pearson r = 0.2918, p-value = 0.1397), neutral (n = 27, Pearson r = -0.02436, p-value = 0.9040),
or positive items (n = 27, Pearson r = 0.2247, p-value = 0.2598). We then asked if perhaps the
relationship between UF integrity and behavioral performance may be mediated by the functional
MRI signal noted in the DG/CA3, since this signal correlates significantly with both UF integrity
and with discrimination performance.

Fig. 5: Schematic summary of mediation results. Here we show decreases in the static measure of uncinate fasciculus
integrity are associated with increased activity in the DG/CA3 subfield of the hippocampus and better discrimination
performance on negative lures. We provide marginal evidence that UF structure exerts its influence on behavior through
altering DG/CA3 activity (β = 0.5638, P = 0.079) possibly as a pathway involved in top-down regulation of hippocampal
processes in episodic memory function. *Significant at alpha=0.05. †Marginally significant.

We implemented a mediation analysis testing whether DG/CA3 activity mediates the relationship
between UF nQA and lure discrimination for highly similar negative lure items. We found a
marginally significant average causal mediation effect (ACME) of DG/CA3 activity during CRs of
highly similar negative items predicting negative LDI (keeping uncinate nQA constant) (β =
0.5638, p-value = 0.079). Additionally, neither the average direct effect (β = 0.2772, p-value =
0.60), total effect (β = 0.108, p-value = 0.8409), or proportions mediated (β = 0.6704, p-value =
0.163) were significant (Fig. 5). This analysis suggests the possibility that UF may serve as a
pathway to regulate DG/CA3 activity and that DG/CA3 is ultimately what influences discrimination
behavior, although given the marginally significant findings, this result should be interpreted with
caution.

Granger et al. Uncinate fasciculus integrity and emotional pattern separation
Discussion:
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the integrity of the uncinate fasciculus is associated
with medial temporal lobe dynamics during an emotional pattern separation task. This stems from
the observation that prefrontal cortex modulation of MTL signaling is implicated in memory
processing (Jones & Wilson, 2005; Kim et al., 2011; Brincat & Miller, 2015; Kesteren et al., 2010),
however, the exact pathways by which this modulation occurs in humans have remained elusive.
Accounting for depressive symptoms, we found that in the left hemisphere, lower uncinate
fasciculus integrity predicted greater activation of the DG/CA3 subfield of the hippocampus during
emotional (positive and negative) highly similar correct discrimination trials. To our knowledge,
this is the first demonstration that differences in uncinate fasciculus integrity may be associated
with alterations of functional activity in the DG/CA3 subfields of the hippocampus during
discrimination of similar information. These findings provide evidence for a potential link between
uncinate integrity and hippocampal activity during emotional conditions.
In addition to providing a link between uncinate structure and DG/CA3 activity, we found that
greater left DG/CA3 activity during highly similar negative correct rejections was related to poorer
memory performance for highly similar negative items (i.e. higher rate of false alarms). Although
at first this result seems surprising, given what is known about the role of DG/CA3 in pattern
separation, a finding of increased activity in DG/CA3 linked to poor performance has been
previously reported in older age (Yassa et al., 2011; Sinha et al., 2018). An interesting possibility
is that the increased excitability is related to CA3’s recurrent collateral network which is thought
to play a role in pattern completion (or overgeneralization in the case of a discrimination task).
While the noted activity occurred during the correct trials, pattern completion is assumed to occur
also during correct lure discrimination (i.e. “recall to reject”). Here, much like the data in older
adults, higher levels of DG/CA3 activity during correct lure discrimination is linked to poorer overall
memory performance at the individual subject level. Overall, this suggests that hyperactivity in
this subfield is associated with worse cognitive outcomes. That said, other work has shown that
a within-subject increase in DG/CA3 activity as a function of mild aerobic exercise is associated
with enhanced discrimination (Suwabe et al. 2018), however this finding also was associated with
increased functional connectivity with regions involved in high precision recollection of memories
(e.g. restrosplenial cortex, angular gyrus). Given this evidence, it is possible that there is an
inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship where activity in DG/CA3 needs to be held in
balance, with too much or too little activity being associated with worse outcomes. This particular
topic should be subject to further investigation.
Our mediation model suggests that while uncinate integrity was not a robust direct predictor of
lure discrimination behavior, its impact on behavior may be mediated by DG/CA3 activity. The
lack of correlation between uncinate integrity and discrimination performance is consistent with
other results from Bennet et al., (2015), who found no link between uncinate integrity and object
discrimination performance. Instead, the authors found a relationship between the fornix and
performance, a relationship that was consistent across young and older adults. The possibility
that the uncinate’s impact on behavior is mediated by functional signals in the DG/CA3 is
consistent with a top-down modulatory control from the PFC to the MTL during discrimination.
Although we tested a focused hypothesis about the uncinate fasciculus and ensured the
specificity of the findings by comparison against a negative control pathway (the corpus callosum),
it is possible that other pathways might influence these emotional memory processes. In general,
the anatomical connectivity of the uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, and fornix bundles and the
relative contributions to MTL-PFC connectivity in humans remains poorly understood. The three-

Granger et al. Uncinate fasciculus integrity and emotional pattern separation
dimensional structures of these pathways have not been extensively resolved in humans or nonhuman primates in vivo. It is possible that information flow is segregated according to information
content and valence. For example, signaling involving emotional items could be reliant on OFC
integration and thus be communicated via the uncinate fasciculus, whereas signaling involving
non-emotional items could be reliant on mPFC (or other PFC region) integration and thus be
communicated via the cingulum or fornix. This may be too simplified, as it is not currently known
whether these pathways innervate overlapping subdivisions of the PFC, and it is unclear what the
functional consequences of these dissociations may be. While speculative, this division of labor
should be subject to further investigation.
One issue for our work and others is the difficulty of even modern tractography algorithms and
data acquisition schemes to accurately and non-invasively model even the largest white matter
bundles with sufficient accuracy in humans (Maier-Hein et al., 2017). Tractography of the uncinate
fasciculus is a particularly challenging endeavor due to its branching and turning patterns and the
possibility for false continuation medially toward the striatum and posteriorly along the inferior
fronto-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.
Our use of more sophisticated tractography algorithms that account for multiple fiber orientations
within each voxel might aid in the delineation of this morphologically complex fiber. For example,
we used normalized quantitative anisotropy, a measure that resolves multiple fiber orientations
within a voxel and appropriately accounts for the isotropic component of diffusion, which
addresses partial volume confounds. We combined this approach with anatomical regions of
avoidance consisting of three intersecting planes and a sphere over the striatal area to ultimately
generate a highly reproducible scheme for tractography of the uncinate fasciculus while avoiding
common false continuations with respect to anatomy.
In this study, we have shown that the decreased UF integrity is associated with greater activity of
DG/CA3 during emotional lure discrimination and that greater DG/CA3 activity is associated with
poor performance on an emotional pattern however, this remains speculative and subject to
further investigation. separation task. Our interpretation of these results is that the UF mediates
important top-down control from the OFC to the MTL which is critical for processing of emotional
memories, but that the relationship between UF integrity and behavior is mediated by functional
activation of the hippocampal network. This suggests that UF integrity may be a marker for
emotional and cognitive health, which is consistent with prior work implicating the UF in emotional
dysregulation conditions including major depressive disorder and anxiety (Zhang et al., 2012), as
well as work linking UF integrity with early life stress and maltreatment (Eluvathingal et al., 2000).
Future studies could examine whether the reported functional and structural findings manifest
beyond emotional discrimination tasks or if there are changes in the relationship in UF’s structure
and function in the context of development and/or aging.

Imaging Data Collection:
All data were collected on a 3-Tesla Philips scanner. We collected an ultrahigh-resolution
structural MPRAGE scan that we developed for accurate delineation of hippocampal subfields
and high-resolution diffeomorphic alignment (0.55 mm isotropic resolution; 273 sagittal slices,
field of view = 240 x 240 mm, flip angle = 9, TR/TE = 13/5.9 ms, matrix size = 448 x 448, inversion
pulse TI = 1110 ms). SENSE parallel imaging was used in two directions (2 x 1.5). The SAR
(<10%) and PNS (<75%) were within required limits based on the scanner-calculated values.
Task-activated functional data were collected and processed in the same manner as Leal et al.,
2014b. Briefly, these data were collected with a high-speed EPI single-shot pulse sequence
(1.5mm isotropic, 19 oblique axial slices parallel to the principal axis of the hippocampus, field of
view = 96 x 96 mm, flip angle= 70, SENSE parallel reduction factor = 2, TR/TE = 1500/30 ms,
matrix size = 64 x 64. Diffusion weighted imaging were collected with an echo planar imaging
sequence. The data were 3 mm isotropic, TR/TE = 6800/67 ms, 65 slices, 32 non-collinear
directions, one b0, b-value = 700 s/mm2. Diffusion MR data were collected at the time of the taskdata.
Emotional Pattern Separation Task Description:
The emotional pattern separation task consists of an incidental encoding phase where subjects
are instructed to rate the valence of each image from positive, negative, or neutral based on a
priori ratings outlined in Leal et al., 2014a. Subjects were later tested during the “Old/New
Recognition” portion of the task. In this portion, foils (new images), targets (same images), and
high and low similarity lures were presented. Subjects were asked to make “Old” or “New”
recognition judgments (Figure 2). In this case, correctly identifying that a lure item was “New” is
termed as a Correct Rejection (CR) and falsely claiming that a lure item is “Old” would be termed
a False Alarm (FA). We assessed behavioral discrimination on this task by quantifying a lure
discrimination index (LDI) which measures performance on the task accounting for response bias:
P(“New”|Lure) – P(“New”|Target) or lure correct rejections minus target misses. This was
calculated for high and low similarity lures across the three valence types. LDI of highly similar
lure items was chosen in this case because of the UFs’ purported role in adjudicating between

measures like correct rejection rate.

Granger et al. Uncinate fasciculus integrity and emotional pattern separation
Functional MRI Image Analysis
Task data were analyzed using the open source package Analysis of Functional Neuroimages
(AFNI) in the manner described in Leal et al., 2014b (Cox, 1996). Briefly, images were corrected
for slice timing and subject motion censoring motion of 3° of rotation or 2mm translocation in any
direction relative to prior acquisition. Upon processing for motion we then registered our functional
images to the structural (MPRAGE) using AFNI/s 3dAllineate program. We use Advanced
Normalization Tools (Avants et al., 2011) which implements a robust diffeomorphic algorithm to
warp structural scans to a common template based on the entire sample. The same
transformations were then applied to the functional data. Finally, behavioral vectors were created
based on trial type orthogonalizing trials unique in emotion, similarity, and behavioral decision.
These vectors there then used in a deconvolution approach based on multiple linear regression
and the resulting fit coefficients (betas) estimated activity versus novel foils as an implicit baseline
for a given time points and trial type in a voxel was calculated. We used the sum of the fit
coefficients over an expected hemodynamic response of 3-12 seconds after trial onset as the
model’s estimate of response to each trial type as described in Leal et al., 2014b. Finally, fit
coefficients were extracted using a region of interest approach for the DG/CA3 and CA1 subfields
of the hippocampus according to Leal et al., 2014b.
Diffusion Weighted Imaging Analysis:
Diffusion data were processed for eddy correction using FSLs eddy_correction and analyzed
using DSI-Studio (http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org). Individual subject data were then processed
using DSI-Studios Q-Spin Diffeomorphic Reconstruction (QSDR) method which calculates the
orientational distribution of the density of diffusing water in MNI space (Yeh & Tseng, 2011). All
subjects met the criterion of fitting to the template space by obtaining an R-squared value of
greater than 0.63 as suggested by the software developers.

Fig. 6. In-vivo dissection of the uncinate fasciculus derived from model-free QSDR and deterministic tractography in
the template space. (a) The “region-of-avoidance” is depicted in yellow, uncinate fasciculus “seed region” depicted in
purple, and “end” region in blue containing merged Brodmanns areas 11 and 47. (b) The resulting UF tractography for
the left hemisphere. The tractography shows branching in the prefrontal cortex region as anatomical studies suggest.
(c) Tractography results for 6 subjects viewed from an axial perspective in the template space. Here we show the
consistent nature of the custom protocol in modeling of this complex pathway. In each of the subjects the U-shaped
fanning bundle is clearly seen with individual difference in the amount of branching in the prefrontal cortex.

QSDR was chosen as the reconstruction method in order to overcome several limitations of the
tensor model. First, QSDR provides reconstruction in a template space allowing the creating of
standardized “regions-of-avoidance” to filter out known false-projecting fibers. Second, QSDR
allowed for the computation of orientation distribution functions rather than tensor-based
computation of diffusion signals. This is important because the orientation distribution functions

calculated with this method are presumed to resolve partial volume fractions, model crossingfibers, and presumably result in more accurate deterministic tractography (Yeh et al., 2013). Our
tractography protocol included a custom region-of-avoidance by merging three intersecting
planes (one axial, one coronal, one sagittal) with a sphere over the striatal and nucleus
accumbens complex (Fig. 6).
The creation of this region allowed the possibility of filtering out false-projections along the inferior
longitudinal fasciculi and projections going medially toward the caudate, striatal areas, and
anterior cingulate cortex. Additionally, we included bilateral uncinate fasciculus regions from the
Johns Hopkins white matter atlas available through DSI-Studio as a “seed region” and
Brodmann’s areas 11 and 47 as an “end” region. The tractography settings included the following
settings: seed count = 500,000, threshold index = QA, FA threshold = 0.0, seed plan = “0”, initial
direction=”0”, interpolation= “0”, step size = “0”, turning angle = “55”, smoothing = 0.6, min length
= 0, max length = 150.
The tractography protocol was repeated for the left and right hemisphere separately by using the
left or right uncinate “seed” region in each iteration. In order to quantify the integrity of the resulting
streamlines we used the model-free measure of normalized quantitative anisotropy (nQA) in order
to quantify the degree of diffusion along principle orientations on an ODF. Although this measure
isn’t directly comparable to FA, it is possible that it more accurately represents the degree of
diffusion among principle axonal directions within a single voxel rather than a singular tensorbased measure that does not account for multiple orientations. Its calculation is described in Yeh
et al., 2013 and it captures the degree of anisotropy among major fiber populations within voxel
accounting for the isotropic component and is normalized on a scale from 0-1. Together, these
methods allowed for consistent modeling of the UF in a standardized way and unbiased by
experimenter manual intervention.
Statistical Analysis:
All statistical analyses were conducted using Prism GraphPad 7 and R-studio. We conducted all
correlational analysis in Prism 7 computing two-tailed Pearson correlation coefficients with 95%
confidence intervals. Multiple linear regressions were used to access the influence of Beck
Depression Inventory scores on relationships between behavior, fMRI, and diffusion measures
and were conducted in R-studio. Mediation analysis was done using the mediate package in R
with bootstrapped confidence intervals and 10,000 simulations. Statistical values were considered
significant at alpha level of 0.05, which appropriately controlled for Type I error.
