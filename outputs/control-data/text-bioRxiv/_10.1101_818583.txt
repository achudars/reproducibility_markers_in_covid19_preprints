Abstract
The coupling of the phase of slower electrophysiological oscillations with the amplitude of faster
oscillations, termed phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), is thought to facilitate dynamic
connectivity in the brain. Though the brain undergoes dramatic changes in connectivity during
the first few years of life, how PAC changes through this developmental period has not been
studied. Here, we examined PAC through electroencephalography (EEG) data collected
longitudinally during an awake, eyes-open EEG collection paradigm in 98 children between the
ages of 3 months and 3 years. We implement a novel technique developed for capturing both
PAC strength and phase preference (i.e., where in the slower oscillation waveform the faster
oscillation shows increased amplitude) simultaneously, and employed non-parametric clustering
methods to evaluate our metrics across a range of frequency pairs and electrode locations. We
found that frontal and occipital PAC, primarily between the alpha-beta and gamma frequencies,
increased from early infancy to early childhood (p = 1.35 x 10-5). Additionally, we found frontal
gamma coupled with the trough of the alpha-beta waveform, while occipital gamma coupled with
the peak of the alpha-beta waveform. This opposing trend may reflect each region’s
specialization towards feedback or feedforward processing, respectively.
Significance Statement
The brain undergoes significant changes in functional connectivity during infancy and early
childhood, enabling the emergence of higher-level cognition. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is
thought to support the functional connectivity of the brain. Here, we find PAC increases from 3
months to 3 years of age. We additionally report the frontal and occipital brain areas show
opposing forms of PAC; this difference could facilitate each region’s tendency towards bottomup or top-down processing.

Introduction
Communication between spatially separated brain regions is a critical component of healthy
brain function. Oscillatory brain activity, created by the synchronous firing of large ensembles of
neurons, is suggested to facilitate this communication: low frequency oscillations may reflect
long distance connections, while high frequency oscillations may reflect local connections (von
Stein and Sarnthein, 2000). Cross frequency coupling, which describes the interaction between
different oscillatory frequencies, may therefore serve to integrate information spatially and
temporally (Canolty and Knight, 2010).
One form of cross-frequency coupling is Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC), in which the phase
of the low frequency activity modulates the amplitude of the high frequency activity. Increasing
evidence implicates PAC in a variety of important functional processes. PAC reflects strength of
functional connectivity (Weaver et al., 2016), and PAC strength and location has been shown to
shift with task demands (Voytek et al., 2010). Additionally, differences in PAC have been found
in a variety of brain disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, and Parkinson’s (Salimpour and Anderson, 2019), highlighting the importance of PAC
for healthy brain functioning.
Moreover, underlying characteristics of PAC may reflect an area’s functional configuration within
neural networks. Phase preference, or the phase of the low frequency waveform corresponding
to the largest amplitude of the high frequency waveform (Figure 1), has been found to differ by
brain area (Ninomiya et al., 2015), coupling frequencies, and task performance (Lega et al.,
2016). Additionally, phase preference can vary between cortical layers: recordings from multielectrode arrays implanted in the striate cortex V1 of macaque monkeys found layers IV and VI
to exhibit opposing phase preferences with respect to alpha oscillations (Bollimunta et al.,
2011). This may relate to how these layers interact with the thalamus, where alpha rhythms are
often thought to originate or project; layer IV tends to receive thalamic input, while layer VI tends

to project back to the thalamus (Guillery and Sherman, 2002). Thus, it is possible that primary
phase preference (as measured on the scalp) could reflect an underlying area’s dynamic
functional configuration as predominantly either feedforward or feedback during the recording
period. Though typical measures of PAC are agnostic to phase preference, these findings
suggest that not just if, but how gamma interacts with lower frequency waveforms may reflect a
region’s role in either the intake or modulation of information for neural processing.
Dramatic developmental changes in functional connectivity have been documented across
fMRI, MEG, and EEG studies (Grayson and Fair, 2017), suggesting PAC and phase preference
would show developmental changes as well. However, no studies have examined the
development of phase preference, and few have examined the development of PAC. Of note,
theta-gamma PAC has been found to increase from 8 to 16 years in response to audio clicktrains, and begins to decrease from 16 to 22 years; it has been hypothesized that this may
relate to developmental changes in GABA transmission and synaptic pruning (Cho et al., 2015).
Still, studies on infancy and early childhood, a period when the brain is highly plastic and shows
significant structural and functional developmental changes, have not been conducted. Only one
study examined PAC during infancy: PAC recorded during sleep decreased over the first two
weeks after birth (Tokariev et al., 2016).
Thus, though the brain continues to demonstrate high plasticity and significant developmental
changes from birth to early childhood (Gao et al., 2017), no studies have examined how PAC or
phase preference develops in this age range. Here we sought to address these gaps by
characterizing, through both PAC strength and phase preference, how PAC develops from
infancy to early childhood. Through this process, we have also developed a novel measure
reflecting both PAC strength and phase preference simultaneously.

Methods
Participants
The data for this study were drawn from a larger longitudinal study of neuro-cognitive
development across the first 3 years of after birth. This study included later born infants who
had at least one typically developing older sibling (Table 1, n = 98). The study was conducted at
Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School and Boston University. All infants had a
minimum gestational age of 36 weeks, no history of prenatal or postnatal medical or
neurological problems, no known genetic disorders (e.g., fragile X, tuberous sclerosis) and no
family history of autism spectrum disorder or other neuropsychiatric conditions (based on parent
report). Institutional review board approval was obtained from both institutions (#X06-08-0374).
EEG Acquisition / Processing
Baseline EEG data were collected at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age, as previously
described (Gabard-Durnam et al., 2019). Infants were seated on their caregiver’s lap while a
research assistant blew bubbles and/or presented toys to ensure the infant remained calm.
Continuous EEG was recorded for up to 5 minutes using either a 64-channel Geodesic Sensor
Net System or 128-channel Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor Nets (Electrical Geodesics, Inc.,
Eugene, OR). Data were sampled at either 250 or 500 Hz, and referenced at collection to a
single vertex electrode (Cz). Impedances were kept below 100 kΩ (within recommended
guidelines for young children, given the high-input impedance capabilities of this system’s
amplifier).
Raw EEG files were exported from NetStation to MATLAB (versionR2017b, MathWorks, Natick,
MA, USA) for preprocessing. Files were processed using the Batch EEG Automated Processing
Platform (BEAPP) (Levin et al., 2018). Within BEAPP, the Harvard Automated Preprocessing
Pipeline for EEG (HAPPE), which was developed specifically to optimize preprocessing of

developmental EEG data with potentially high levels of artifact and short recordings, was used
to automate preprocessing and artifact minimization (Gabard-Durnam et al., 2018). Data were
first filtered using a 1 Hz high-pass filter and a 100 Hz low-pass filter. Data sampled at 500 Hz
were then downsampled to 250 Hz for consistency. Only electrodes in the international 10-20
system were included in this pipeline; all other electrodes were removed before further analysis.
Regions of signal with any channel’s amplitude >40 μV (the HAPPE default threshold, reflecting
the reduced signal amplitude that results from wavelet-thresholding and independent
components analysis in HAPPE) were removed prior to segmenting data into 2 second windows
for PAC analysis. For each participant, 30 segments (60 seconds of data) were then randomly
selected for further analysis; files with fewer than 30 segments of data at this stage were not
analyzed (Table 2). Primary PAC metrics were then obtained using code added to the BEAPP
software.
Five EEG recordings were more than 3 standard deviations from the mean on one of the
following HAPPE data quality output parameters: percent good channels, mean retained artifact
probability, median retained artifact probability, percent of independent components rejected,
and percent variance retained after artifact removal. These EEGs were evaluated for differences
in overall PAC (averaged across frequencies and channels); all files were found to be within 2
SD’s of the mean at the time point of collection, so these files were included in later analyses.
Computation of PAC Metrics
Modulation Index: PAC was first quantified using the Modulation Index (MI) (Tort et al., 2010).
For each frequency pair, the raw signal in each segment was exported from MATLAB into
Python and filtered into a low frequency and high frequency signal using code adapted from
(Dupré la Tour et al., 2017). Because the frequency pairs at which PAC occurs in our age group
have not been previously well defined, we began by examining PAC across a range of
frequencies. To do so, for each EEG the raw signal was filtered across a range of low frequency

(2-20 Hz in 2 Hz steps) and high frequency (20-100 Hz in 4 Hz steps) combinations.
Subsequently, the time series of phases of the low frequency signal and the amplitude of the
high frequency signal were computed. The phases of the low frequency signal were then binned
into 18 20o intervals (-180o to 180o), and the mean of the amplitude of the high frequency signal
occurring within each phase bin was calculated. Data were then imported into MATLAB, where
the amplitude of the high frequency signal (HFamp) at each phase of the low frequency signal
(LFϕ) was then averaged together across segments before computing the MIraw as the KullbackLeibler divergence from a uniform amplitude distribution (Tort et al., 2010). To control for factors
not of interest that have been shown to affect PAC (such as spectral power), for each
participant, 200 surrogate MI values (MIsurr) were generated by repeating the procedure after
offsetting HFamp from LFϕ by a randomized time shift between 0.1 to 1.9 seconds. From this
distribution, the mean (μ(MIsurr)) and standard deviation were then calculated. A normalized MI
(MInorm) was then computed as the z-score of the MIraw compared to the distribution of MIsurr
values (Canolty et al., 2007). Consequently, for each EEG, a single MIraw, μ(MIsurr), and MInorm
were obtained.
Phase Bias: The Tort method used here to quantify PAC captures the presence of coupling,
irrespective of where in the LFϕ the high frequency signal demonstrates increased amplitude.
However, PAC can result from an increase high frequency amplitude anywhere in the low
frequency waveform, including at either the positive or negative phases, corresponding to the
peak and trough of the waveform respectively (Lega et al., 2016) (Figure 1). Therefore, we
created a new metric to quantify the phase range (positive phases or negative phases) of the
low frequency signal where the high frequency signal showed increased amplitude.
To do so, we quantified the bias of the HFamp to the positive phases of LFϕ. Specifically, we
defined the phase bias (ϕ bias) of a given LFϕ, HFamp pair (i.e., proportion of HFamp occurring in
the positive phases of the LFϕ) as: ϕ bias = (ΣHFamp in positive phases of the LFϕ) / Σ(HFamp in

all phases of the LFϕ). Thus, a value below .5 indicates the HFamp shows a preference for the
negative phases of LFϕ, while a value above .5 indicates the HFamp shows a preference for the
positive phases of LFϕ. Additionally, a larger distance from .5 (where HFamp shows no
preference for either positive or negative phases of LFϕ) indicates stronger ϕ bias. The ϕ bias
metric was computed on the original signal to obtain the ϕ biasraw. Then, in the same manner
MIsurr values were computed, ϕ bias was additionally computed after offsetting HFamp from LFϕ
by a randomized time shift to obtain 200 surrogate ϕ bias values (ϕ biassurr), of which the mean
was taken (μ(ϕ biassurr)).
Statistical Analysis
Cluster Correction: For every electrode, we now had obtained PAC values for each frequency
pair. To identify statistically significant regions of interest both across frequency pairs and
across channels, we first employed a clustering method. We used the clustering techniques
described below to identify regions of interest for three PAC metrics. First, we clustered on MI to
identify regions that exhibited PAC (PAC+). Second, we clustered on ϕ bias to identify regions
where HFamp is significantly increased in the negative phases of LFϕ (-LFϕ preference); i.e., ϕ
bias < 0.5. Third, we clustered again on ϕ bias, this time to identify regions where HFamp is
increased in the positive phases of LFϕ (+LFϕ preference); i.e., ϕ bias > 0.5. All three of these
techniques used data from all useable EEGs, at every age (3 months to 3 years) at which they
were collected. We then modified the clustering metrics to identify regions where these three
PAC metrics changed with age.
Whereas most clustering procedures involve comparing one condition to another (i.e., task vs.
baseline stimuli), our task analyzed resting EEG data and therefore had no analogous
comparison condition (or baseline) against which to test. In its place, we used the mean of the
metric across the surrogate values (μ(MIsurr) or μ(ϕ biassurr)). These data serve as an effective
‘control’ set as it retains the characteristics of the signal (power, noise), while any coupling

present in the actual signal should not be retained. Thus, we used clustering against μ(MIsurr) or
μ(ϕ biassurr) to reveal regions where the PAC metric of interest is present to a significant degree.
Identification of PAC+ Regions across all ages: For our clustering procedure, we implemented a
method that closely followed that by (Maris and Oostenveld, 2007).
1. For every channel, between every filtered low frequency signal and high frequency
signal, a t-test was used to compare the MIraw values across all files and the μ(MIsurr)
values across all files.
2. Data points where the null hypothesis was rejected (p < .05, 2-sided t-test) were
selected.
3. Selected data points on the same channel adjacent to one another in terms of low
frequency or high frequency were grouped together into clusters (MATLAB function
bwlabel, connectivity = 4).
4. After subtracting the minimum t value needed to achieve p < .05 from all data points,
cluster level statistics were computed by taking the sum of t values within each cluster.
Then, to compute which clusters were significant (i.e. unlikely to occur with that strength or size
by chance, or to remove clusters that may be spurious), we implemented the following:
1. For half of the participants, selected randomly, the MIraw and μ(MIsurr) data were ‘flipped’,
such that their μ(MIsurr) data were treated as MIraw, and their MIraw were treated as
μ(MIsurr).
2. Test statistics and cluster sizes were calculated in the same manner as used previously.
3. The previous steps were repeated 200 times, creating a distribution of cluster sizes.
4. Clusters < 95th percentile of this distribution were removed from further analysis.
Identification of -LFϕ preference and +LFϕ preference regions across all ages: This procedure
was then repeated using ϕ biasraw and μ(ϕ biassurr) as the PAC metric, with the goal of identifying

-LFϕ preference regions and +LFϕ preference regions. Unlike comparing MIraw and MIsurr, where
PAC should lead to MIraw being greater, not less, than MIsurr, PAC can lead to ϕ biasraw being
greater than or less than μ(ϕ biassurr). When HFamp is increased in the negative phases of LFϕ, ϕ
biasraw will be less than μ(ϕ biassurr), and when HFamp is increased in the positive phases of LFϕ,
ϕ biasraw will be greater than μ(ϕ biassurr). As a result, clusters where the t-statistic is significantly
negative highlight regions where HFamp is increased in the negative phases of LFϕ, while
clusters where the t-statistic is significantly positive highlight regions where HFamp is increased in
the positive phases of LFϕ. For this reason, the clustering procedure was implemented twice,
once with a left-tailed t-test, and once with a right-tailed t-test (p < .025 to reject Ho). This
prevented grouping of regions where some data points exhibited -LFϕ preference and some
exhibited a +LFϕ preference.
Development of PAC Metrics with age: Several different regions of interest survived cluster
correction, where PAC metrics (MI or ϕ bias) were found to be significant when EEGs from all
ages (3 months to 3 years) were included. To investigate how our PAC metrics in these regions
changed with age, age was correlated with MInorm averaged in each area (PAC+, -LFϕ
preference, +LFϕ preference), as well as in all frequencies and channels tested. This was
repeated with ϕ bias as the metric; however, because averaging ϕ bias in regions that exhibit
opposing phase preference will cancel out these phase preferences, ϕ bias was only analyzed
in regions grouped by phase preference (-LFϕ preference, +LFϕ preference).
The above-mentioned clustering techniques determined regions in which PAC metrics were
significant when EEGs from all ages were included. However, it is possible that a different set of
regions would be significant when clustering techniques were altered to explicitly determine
regions in which PAC metrics demonstrated significant change across age. Therefore, we
developed two additional clustering techniques that aim to capture regions where PAC metrics
change with age.

Identification of regions where MI changes with age: We designed a clustering metric to capture
regions where MI values change with age. To do so, we ran the clustering algorithm as
described previously with the exception of the test statistic. For each channel and frequency
pair, the MIraw and μ(MIsurr) data of each participant were collected. Data were given a label for
an additional variable ‘raw’, such that MIraw data were labeled as 1 and μ(MIsurr) data as 0. A
linear regression was then run, where MI was predicted by the variables age, raw, and the
interaction between age and raw. The test-statistic (t value and p value) was then defined as the
respective values for the coefficient of this interaction term. Consequently, a positive and
significant t value indicates MIraw increased more with age than μ(MIsurr), and positive clusters
therefore indicate regions where PAC is increasing with age.
Identification of regions where ϕ bias changes with age: This procedure was then repeated
using ϕ biasraw and μ(ϕ biassurr) as the PAC metric, with the goal of identifying regions where ϕ
bias changed with age. As with clustering on ϕ bias over all ages, the clustering procedure was
implemented twice, once with a left-tailed t-test, and once with a right-tailed t-test (p < .025 to
reject Ho in each case).
Results
Identification of PAC+ Regions across all ages: Clustering on MI of all participants regardless of
age selected 67.12% of low frequency, high frequency, and channel combinations (Figure 2,
Table S1). All channels analyzed contained at least one significant cluster of PAC, with the
largest clusters centered primarily occipitally (channels O1, O2, and P7) and frontally (Fp1 and
Fp2).
Identification of -LFϕ preference and +LFϕ preference regions across all ages: Clustering on ϕ
bias of all participants regardless of age revealed two sets of clusters: -LFϕ preference regions,
which occurred primarily frontally, where ϕ bias was significantly less than μ(ϕ biassurr), and +LFϕ
preference regions, which occurred more posteriorly, where ϕ bias was significantly greater than

μ(ϕ biassurr) (Figure 3a, Table S2). Phase amplitude plots for each area confirm each area shows
opposing phase preference. -LFϕ preference regions demonstrate a peak in high frequency
amplitude occuring at approximately -90o low frequency phase, as well as a trough occurring at
+90o (Figure 3b), while +LFϕ preference regions show a peak in high frequency amplitude
occurring at approximately +90o low frequency phase, and a trough occurring at -90o phase
(Figure 3c).
Development of PAC Metrics with age: We then investigated how our PAC metrics in these
clusters changed with age (Table 3). MInorm in PAC+ regions increases with age (Table 3, Figure
4) and does not differ as a function of net type (p > .1). Changes in ϕ bias depend on region
(determined regardless of age): in -LFϕ preference regions, ϕ bias decreases with age, while in
+LFϕ preference regions, ϕ bias increases with age (Table 3, Figure 5). ϕ bias in these two
regions has a strong inverse correlation (r = 0.612, p = 4.25 x 10-41).
Identification of regions where MI changes with age: We then conducted an analysis of all
electrodes and frequency pairs to determine which regions showed significant changes in MI
with age. All regions found to be significant in this analysis showed an increase (as opposed to
a decrease) in MI with age. We found increases in MI occurred most prominently in the posterior
regions (Figure 6, Table S3). Specifically, we found the largest cluster in the alpha-beta and
gamma frequency pairs centered on O2, and extending to electrodes O1, Pz, P8, and P7.
Identification of regions where ϕ bias changes with age: We then examined which regions
showed changes in ϕ bias with age. In posterior regions, ϕ bias showed similar increases with
age as MI (Figure 7). Additionally, ϕ bias showed a group of negative clusters largely anteriorly,
highlighting regions which develop a stronger preference for the negative phases of LFϕ with
age (Table S4).

Discussion
Though the brain exhibits significant changes in functional connectivity during infancy and early
childhood, how PAC and its underlying phase preference develops over this period has not
been studied. Here, we demonstrate the typical development of PAC from 3 months through 3
years of age. This PAC occurs most prominently between alpha-beta and gamma, largely
consistent with several reports of alpha-gamma PAC in resting state recordings (Roux et al.,
2013; Berman et al., 2015; Gohel et al., 2016), but is also present between theta and beta, theta
and gamma, and alpha and beta. We observe PAC broadly across the scalp, suggesting a
relatively ubiquitous presence of cross-frequency coupling. The phase preference of this PAC
shows opposing trends, separated by scalp region: PAC in posterior areas (particularly over
occipital lobes) is driven by a peak in gamma amplitude during the positive phases of LFϕ, while
PAC in anterior areas (particularly over frontal lobes) is driven by a peak in gamma amplitude
during the negative phases of the LFϕ. Though these areas appear to demonstrate similar PAC
as indicated by MI, these two forms can be separated effectively using a measure of ϕ bias
newly described above.
It is possible that phase bias may reflect the functional specialization of feedback (e.g.,
corticothalamic) and feedforward (e.g., thalamocortical) activity in the frontal and occipital areas
respectively. Gamma amplitude is maximal at the peak (90°) of the alpha-beta wave in the
occipital cortex, but gamma amplitude is maximal at the trough (-90°) of the alpha-beta wave in
the frontal cortex. It has been previously described that cortical layer 4 (which predominantly
accepts thalamic input) and layer 6 (which predominantly provides thalamic input) (Guillery and
Sherman, 2002) exhibit opposing phase preferences in respect to alpha oscillations (Bollimunta
et al., 2011). This functional specialization is also reflected structurally: layer IV tends to be thick
posteriorly but thin anteriorly in the cortex, whereas layer VI tends to be thick in frontal cortex
but thin in occipital and other predominantly sensory cortices (Wagstyl et al., 2019). Scalp

recordings cannot classically differentiate among the cortical layers that may be driving findings
in particular electrodes. In the context of these prior findings, however, the possibility should be
considered that gamma amplitude synchronizing with the alpha-beta peak (i.e., +LFϕ
preference) could reflect a predominance of feedforward, bottom-up processes (e.g., processing
of visual information entering the occipital cortex), while synchronization with the alpha-beta
trough could reflect a predominance of feedback, top-down processes (e.g., internal regulation
of attention by the frontal cortex). In this case, the findings would thus suggest that over the first
years of life, there is a specialization of regions for their particular functions: while there is
indeed a developmental shift towards primarily feedforward activity with age measured over
occipital regions (where incoming visual information is processed) there is also a shift towards
more feedback activity measured over frontal regions (which provide top-down regulation of how
the brain processes information).
An alternative (though not necessarily incongruous) explanation for the opposing phase
preferences across regions involves a dipole effect. Dipole effects are frequently observed in
EEG data (Ebersole, 1991; Ochi et al., 2001) and reflect a single tangentially oriented source
(Osipova et al., 2008). However, the broad (rather than more localized) dipole effect seen here
would likely reflect a deep source (e.g., originating from thalamus rather than cortex). While
alpha and surrounding frequencies can indeed originate in the thalamus (or involve
thalamocortical circuitry) (Bollimunta et al., 2011; Seeber et al., 2019), higher-frequency activity
such as gamma is typically thought to originate more locally (Buzsáki and Wang, 2012).
Therefore, while a single deep source may determine or coordinate LFϕ across multiple regions,
this source is unlikely to be generating the coupled HFamp portion of the signal. Additionally,
while high frequency activity can occur as a result of muscle artifact, we would not expect such
artifactual activity to be coupled the phase of the lower frequency activity.

It has been suggested PAC may serve to connect spatially and functionally segregated regions
depending on the task; here, participants were not given an explicit task. Interestingly, the
electrodes and frequencies where we observe the strongest PAC largely overlap with the
electrodes (O1/O2, P3/P4, P7/P8, F3/F4, and Fz) frequency bands (alpha and beta) implicated
in the DMN, a network thought to be active during resting state (Buckner et al., 2008). However,
due to the limited spatial resolution of EEG, alternative methods are needed to better test this
hypothesis.
This study has several limitations. First, our sample size at the 3 month time point was relatively
small (n=14); more participants would allow for a more exact description of PAC at this age.
Additionally, because most participants did not provide useable data for all time points, the
study did not analyze trajectories of PAC on an individual level. Finally, though EEG’s temporal
resolution lends itself to analyzing PAC, weak spatial resolution prevents more exact description
of the PAC development across brain regions and layers; research using alternative
neuroimaging methods, or source analysis, could answer some of the questions we leave open
here.
In summary, this study documents the emergence of PAC in early childhood. We describe a
new metric for measuring phase bias, which reflects more fine-grained information about PAC
than the modulation index. We find HFamp is increased at opposing phases of LFϕ in anterior
areas as compared to posterior areas. Future studies would be beneficial in further assessing
the potential functional relevance of this metric; we suggest laminar differences in the direction
of information flow (feedforward vs. feedback) as one potential avenue for further exploration.

cover most of the comodulogram; therefore, in these cases, white lines outlining blue regions
mark the border of a small area that is not PAC+. Comodulograms indicate the level of coupling
