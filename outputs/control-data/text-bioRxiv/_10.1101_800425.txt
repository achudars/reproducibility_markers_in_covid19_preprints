In brief
Collective actions of vasopressin and oxytocin determine social salience. Borie et al. find that the degree of social
novelty moderates a dialogue between networks secreting social salience hormones in the lateral septum, a region
organizing sequential content of sensory experiences. Social withdrawal of mice lacking the autism gene Magel2 is
alleviated by restoration of dialogue-lead with vasopressin.

Summary
Intellectual and social disabilities are common comorbidities in adolescents and adults
with Magel2 gene deficiency characterizing the Prader-Willi and Schaaf-Yang
neurodevelopmental syndromes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the risk for
autism in these syndromes are unexplored. Here we used Magel2 knockout mice combined with
optogenetic/pharmacological tools to characterize disease modifications in the social brain
network. We find that the degree of social novelty moderates a dialogue between vasopressin
and oxytocin in the lateral septum, a region organizing sequential content of sensory
experiences. Social withdrawal of mice lacking Magel2 is alleviated by restoration of dialoguelead by vasopressin. This preclinical study identifies the collective actions of vasopressin and
oxytocin in the lateral septum as a key factor in the pathophysiology.
Introduction
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) affect 1 in 68 and are characterized by difficulties
with communication, restrictive interests and repetitive behaviors influencing the ability to
function properly (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition).
Treatment of ASD is marginal such that management of disability-adjusted life years imposes
substantial economic cost and burden on families and society1. Neurodevelopmental disorders
characterized by mutations of chromosome 15q11-13 exhibit higher than normal risk for
comorbid ASD, indicating the importance of genes in this locus for the pathophysiology2,3. It is
a large chromosomal deletion of 15q11-13 in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and a disruption of
one gene in this locus, Magel2, in Schaaf-Yang Syndrome (SYS) that provide respectively, 25%
and 75% risk for ASD based on clinical assessment by an expert physician2,3. Magel2 is a
maternally imprinted, paternally expressed gene central to the pathophysiology of PWS and
SYS4, which deficiency interferes with developmental functions essential for setting multi-scale
organization of the nervous system controlling muscle tone and feeding5,6. Common
symptomatic features of PWS and SYS are hypotonia, feeding difficulties during early life,
social withdrawal, intellectual and/or developmental delay4,7,8.
Mice lacking Magel2 gene are a good model of SYS and PWS with construct and face
validity as knockout mice present hypotonia, feeding difficulties during early life and social
deficits9–11. Treatment with oxytocin (OXT) around birth restores feeding in Magel2 knockout
(KO) mice9 and pediatric PWS patients12 suggesting predictive validity of this mouse model.
Adult Magel2 KO mice also present ASD-like features, such as social withdrawal ameliorated
by perinatal OXT treatments9,10.
Modulation of social behavior with OXT has been at the center of many studies13 and it
is now accepted that OXT contributes to filtering social salience signals14. OXT is used in
numerous clinical trials15 with promising results for the treatment of ASD. While beneficial
effects were observed in PWS patients treated with OXT, these effects are age dependent16 and
not consistently found over different clinical trials17. Furthermore, chronic OXT treatments
might be deleterious to specific aspects of social behavior18,19. This suggests that OXT therapy
is not sufficient to treat social disabilities beyond the early postnatal critical period of
neurodevelopment20 and stresses the need to better understand the OXT system and its
modulators for treating social withdrawal in the adults.
Vasopressin (AVP), a peptide sharing many features with OXT21, is also important for
the regulation of social salience and has been in the center of new clinical studies. ASD patients
improved social communication upon treatment with AVP22 as well as with antagonists of AVP
receptor subtype 1a (AVPR1a)23. The positive outcomes of both trials demands clarity about the

mechanisms underlying AVPR responses in ASD and related diseases like PWS and SYS. We
hypothesized that collective actions of OXT and AVP in the social salience brain network could
explain the controversial efficacy of AVPR targeted therapies. Unfortunately, the roles of OXT
and AVP have mainly been interrogated in isolation whereas combinatorial effects are
anticipated24 given that both OXT and AVP are secreted in the brain upon social encounters25.
Here, we devised strategies to understand the dual functions of AVP and OXT during social
encounters in physiological conditions and in the context of Magel2 deficiency.
Results
Social withdrawal linked to brain theta rhythmicity defects in Magel2+m/-p mice
Brain rhythmic activity, notably theta paced, across multiple regions of the social brain
network is modulated by the novelty of social stimulus and associated with cognitive and
emotional behaviors in humans and rodents26,27. Nonetheless, socially evoked theta rhythmicity
has not been studied in animal models featuring autistic-like social withdrawal like the
Magel2+m/-p mice. We used a telemetric system to record the brain electroencephalogram (EEG)
from wire electrodes chronically implanted atop cortex as previously described28. Wired animals
were subjected to multiple social trials with an unfamiliar juvenile (T1 to T4) followed by the
encounter with a different juvenile (T5) to discriminate between degrees of novelty of the social
stimulus (Fig. 1a). Magel2+m/-p mice performed poorly on the discrimination task with a mouse
whereas object exploration was normal compared to WT littermate controls (Fig. 1b). At T1,
EEG power spectral density analysis showed a socially induced modulation of activity in the
theta band of healthy controls that is absent in Magel2+m/-p mice (Fig. 1c). The effect of
Magel2+m/-p was specific of social stimulus as no difference with controls was observed during
trials with objects (Fig. 1c). Changes of socially evoked theta rhythmicity correlated with the
exploration time of conspecifics in WT controls but not in Magel2+m/-p mice (Fig. 1d). This
contrasted with theta rhythmicity in trials with objects that did not correlate with the degree of
novelty in WT controls but did in Magel2+m/-p mice (Fig. 1d). Therefore, this behavioral
paradigm is sufficiently robust in Magel2+m/-p mice to detect social exploration disabilities
consistent with brain theta rhythmicity defects particularly marked during the first social
encounter.
Abnormal septal oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic systems in Magel2+m/-p mice
Previously, we showed that low number of OXTR binding sites specifically in the lateral
septum (LS) of Magel2+m/-p mice covariate with social withdrawal10. This suggests a key role for
the LS and its modulation by OXT in the physiopathology. C-Fos mapping showed more robust
induction in the LS after interaction with a conspecific than with an object (Fig. S1a), an effect
validated with p-S6 as indicator of rapid signaling (Fig. S1b). Compared to WT controls, basal
expression of c-Fos was high and less reactive to social trials particularly in the LS dorsal (LSD)
of Magel2+m/-p mice (Fig. S1c,d). Additionally, there were fewer and shorter AVP fibers in the
LSD of Magel2+m/-p mice (Fig. S2a,b) as well as more OXT fibers in the septum (Fig. S2c,d).
Such genotypic differences of topological innervations in septum suggest that both OXT and
AVP actions may influence sociability between mice as previously hypothesized in healthy
rats29,30.
To monitor the impact of AVP and the OXT analog agonist TGOT on theta rhythmicity,
we combined bilateral intraseptal peptide injections with EEG recordings in freely moving
cannulated mice (Fig. 2a). EEG power spectral analysis showed a trough of activity in the 4-8
Hz band and peak of activity in the 8-12 Hz band with AVP that contrasted with an opposite

effect of TGOT (Fig. 2b). Such changes of theta rhythmicity mimicked patterns evoked in WT
mice at social trials T1 and T4, respectively (cf. Fig. 1c). Implicitly, it suggests that a deficit of
septal AVP at T1 might impair social exploration similar to the effect of Magel2 deficiency. To
test this possibility, we injected an AVPR antagonist, the Manning compound (MC) into the
septum at T1 or T3 to assess its influence on social behavior and theta rhythm (see methods for
details about in vivo pharmacology). Only at T1, the blockade of AVPR with MC impaired
social exploration like the effect of Magel2 deficiency (Fig. 2c). Similarly, and only at T3, the
blockade of OXT receptors (OXTR) by intraseptal injection of the selective antagonist Atosiban
impaired social exploration like the effect of Magel2 deficiency (Fig. 2c). Consistently, the
blockade of septal AVPR at T1 and OXTR at T3 modified theta rhythmicity throughout the
remaining trials (Fig. 2d). Together, social exploration correlated with theta rhythmicity in these
mice unless septal AVPR and OXTR were inhibited at T1 (Fig. 2e) and T3 (Fig. 2f),
respectively. Therefore, timely actions of AVPR and OXTR in septum generate a sequence of
brain activity patterns aligned with the degree of novelty of the social stimulus.
Social salience depends on the AVP and OXT hypothalamoseptal circuits
To investigate timely activations of AVP and OXT neuronal networks, we first identified
which cells responded throughout social trials to target their projections to LS with optogenetic
constructs. We extended the initial c-Fos mapping to four brain regions containing AVP and
OXT neurons: PVN, SON, BNST and LH31–33. AVP neurons were activated at T1 in the PVN of
WT mice and in the BNST of Magel2+m/-p mice (Fig. S3a,b). OXT neurons were activated at T4
in the PVN of WT mice but less significantly in Magel2+m/-p mice (Fig. S3c,d). Thus, PVN
neurons could be responsible for the release of AVP or OXT in the septum of WT mice unlike
the septum of Magel2+m/-p mice that could rely on BNST neurons to secrete AVP.
To determine if the aforementioned sources of AVP and OXT modulate social behavior,
we adopted an optogenetic silencing strategy. To this end, we used Avp-CRE and Oxt-CRE
transgenic mice to independently target AAV virus coding for the CRE-dependent
halorhodopsin (NpHR3.0-YFP) or eYFP into the PVN or BNST as indicated in Fig. 3a. CREmediated recombination was specific and efficient to express NpHR3.0-YFP either in OXT
neurons of PVN or in AVP neurons of PVN or BNST (Fig. 3b). A prerequisite to operate as
PVN-LS or BNST-LS circuits responding to social trials was that these neurons projected YFPpositive axon boutons into the septum (Fig. S4a). As expected, yellow light stimulation of
recombinant NpHR3.0 in PVN of coronal brain slices reduced the firing rate of target neurons
(Fig. 3c). In LS coronal slices, patch clamp recordings of predefined AVP-responding cells or
TGOT-responding cells determined the impact of optogenetic manipulations specifically at axon
boutons (Fig. S4b). Yellow light stimulation of NpHR3.0 on these cells had no effect in absence
of social trials (Fig. S4b-d). On the contrary, blue light stimulation of ChR2-YFP (expressed
with similar viral strategy) evoked responses typical of AVP in predefined AVP-responding
cells in Avp-CRE animals (Fig. S4e) as well as TGOT in predefined TGOT-responding cells in
Oxt-CRE animals (Fig. S4f). Importantly, blue-light evoked responses were blocked by the
AVPR antagonist at AVP-responding cells, and OXTR antagonist at TGOT-responding cells.
These results validated the optogenetic control of OXT or AVP releases from axon boutons in
LS.
Optic fibers were chronically implanted atop LS bilaterally of WT mice to achieve lightdependent silencing of projecting axons from AVP neurons at T1 and from OXT neurons at T3.
We found that yellow light stimulation of NpHR3.0 in the PVN-LS AVP pathway (Fig. 3d
right) and the PVN-LS OXT pathway (Fig. 3e) impaired social exploration distinctly.

Hypothalamoseptal pathways activated timely to generate a functional sequence of AVP and
OXT septal releases according to the degree of novelty of the social stimulus. In contrast,
silencing of an extra-hypothalamoseptal pathway, the BNST-LS pathway failed to modify
exploration through social trials (Fig. 3d left), highlighting remarkable specificity about AVP
input source to the LS of WT mice under these behavioral conditions.
Disarray of AVP and OXT septal releases disrupted exploration of social salient stimuli
As sequential septal release of AVP and OXT is critical to express social exploration, we
aimed to disrupt this orderly sequence during social trials with optogenetic stimulation of the
hypothalamoseptal pathways. We used CRE-dependent ChR2-YFP or eYFP constructs
delivered into the PVN or BNST of Avp-CRE and Oxt-CRE mice and induced light stimulation
of LS projecting axons from the BNST-LS or PVN-LS circuits to alter the orderly sequence of
AVP and OXT releases (Fig. S5a-c). Deficits of social exploration manifested if AVP was
released at T3 instead of T1 from BNST-LS pathway and if OXT was secreted at T1 instead of
T3 from PVN-LS pathway (Fig. S5d-e). Therefore, it is not the releases of AVP and OXT per
se, but its orderly sequence aligned to the degree of social novelty that determined social
exploration.
Paucity of cells responding to AVP and OXT orderly sequence in LS of Magel2+m/-p mice
Cellular targets in the LS of AVP and OXT orderly sequence remained to be explored.
We used patch clamp recordings in coronal brain slices to characterize neurons in LS based on
changes of firing rate upon bath application of AVP or TGOT. Half of the cells were selectively
excited by AVP (type I) whereas the others were either stimulated selectively by TGOT (type
II), or inhibited by both peptides (type III) (Fig. 4a). Retrobead anatomical tracing (Fig. 4b)
revealed that the type II and III cells mostly, projected to the medial septum (MS). Connection
between this pathway and the hippocampus34 is known to organize sequential content of sensory
experiences via theta-paced sequence of cell assemblies35–37. Modulation of sequential content
by LS neurons may rely on inputs containing AVP from the hypothalamus, and glutamate from
hippocampus38, whereas outputs to MS are enriched with OXTR, suggesting that both peptides
could act at different levels of this circuit. Electrophysiological response of the type III cells
depended on the orderly sequence of AVP and TGOT contrary to the other cell types recorded.
That is, AVP must be presented first to gain responsiveness to TGOT while the effect of AVP
was unconditional to the order of presentation (Fig. 4c). These neurons also differed in terms of
spontaneous activity patterns, morphology, and other electrophysiological properties (Fig S6).
Importantly, type III neurons were scarcer while type II neurons were denser in
Magel2+m/-p mice than in WT controls (Fig. 4d). Such a change of proportion between cell types
could depend on OXTR and AVPR dual expression. To distinguish AVPR and OXTR binding
sites with cellular resolution, we synthetized d[Lys(Alexa-Fluor-647)8]VP, a fluorescent peptide
selective for mouse OXTR in vitro (Fig. 5a) and in vivo if co-injected with the competitive
AVPR ligand MC (Fig. 5b bottom left). For a rather selective labeling of mouse AVPR(s) in
vivo, higher dose of the fluorescent peptide was used with the competitive OXTR ligand TGOT
(Fig. 5b bottom right). When injected in LS after social trials, d[Lys(Alexa-Fluor-647)8]VP
marked cells equipped with OXTR or AVPR, some of which also contained the activitydependent indicator p-S6 and retrobeads (Fig. 5c). Specifically, LS cells projecting to MS were
more abundant and more responsive to social trials in WT controls than in Magel2+m/-p mice
(Fig. 5d,e). These cells are mostly GABAergic somatostatin neurons labelled with retrobeads

(likely the type III, Fig. S7). All in all, the septum of Magel2+m/-p mice is ill equipped to
organize sequential content of social signals evoked by AVP and OXT releases (Fig. 5f).
AVPR priming in LS of Magel2+m/-p mice restored exploration of social salient stimuli
To normalize theta-paced sequence of cell assemblies in the LS of Magel2+m/-p mice, we
promoted AVPR septal response during the first social encounter (Fig. S8d). For this,
Magel2+m/-p mice were cannulated in LS to receive bilateral AVP injections at T1, which
increased theta rhythmicity throughout trials (Fig. S8a) and restored social exploration (Fig.
6a). These activities were not correlated if NaCl or AVP+Atosiban were injected instead of
AVP alone (Fig. 6b and methods for details about in vivo pharmacology). Consistently, NaCl or
AVP+Atosiban injections failed to restore theta rhythmicity and social exploration (Fig. 6a,
S8a). Thus, inhibition of septal OXTR with Atosiban despite AVPR priming highlighted the
necessity of AVPR and OXTR collective responses to restore social behavior of Magel2+m/-p
mice.
In a second experiment, we promoted the OXT system of Magel2+m/-p mice given its
clinical potential for alleviating social disabilities in humans39,40. To this end, we used
optogenetic stimulation of CRE-dependent ChR2-YFP recombined in OXT neurons of PVN in
Oxt-CRE x Magel2+m/-p mice to promote OXT septal release during social habituation. This
manipulation increased exploration duration with known and unknown mice without
discrimination (Fig. 6c), and exploration duration correlated with changes of theta rhythmicity
(Fig. 6d). Theta rhythm of Magel2+m/-p mice optogenetically-stimulated for OXT septal release
(Fig. S8b) looks alike that of WT mice optogenetically-deprived of AVPR septal response at T1
(Fig. 2d). Thus, OXT therapies may not be optimally effective in diseases characterized by
AVPR sequential priming defects.
In a third experiment, we used optogenetic stimulation of ChR2-YFP recombined in
AVP neurons of PVN or BNST of Avp-CRE x Magel2+m/-p mice to simulate AVP release
normally evoked by the first social encounter. We found that blue light-stimulation of the
BNST-LS AVP pathway promoted consistent social exploration (Fig. 6e right) unlike
stimulation of the PVN-LS AVP pathway (Fig. 6e left). Optogenetic stimulation of BNST-LS
AVP terminals of Magel2+m/-p mice modulated theta rhythmicity (Fig. S8c) that correlated with
social exploration (Fig. 6f). This result indicates that social behavior is restored in Magel2+m/-p
mice by promoting AVPR septal response during the first encounter through the BNST-LS AVP
pathway.
Collectively, one promising avenue for disease modification is to restore the orderly
sequence of AVP and OXT responses for organizing theta-paced sequence of social salient
information flow through the septum.
Discussion
One major feature of physiopathology associated with Magel2 deficiency reported in this
study is the abnormal functional topology of both the AVP and OXT neuronal networks
innervating the septum. This is decisive because AVP and OXT must act collectively on septal
neurons to demonstrate social salience. Normally, AVP acts first on septal neurons upon release
evoked by the novelty of the social stimulus while OXT acts second on septal neurons upon
release elicited by the repetition of the social stimulus as previously suggested in rats41,42. It is
the degree of social novelty that commanded sequential activations of AVP and OXT
hypothalamoseptal neuronal networks as seen with the c-Fos mapping studies.

Pathologically, not only septal AVP fibers were scarcer and PVN AVP neurons poorly
activated upon social novelty but also a cryptic extra-hypothalamoseptal AVP network
originating from the BNST was activated by social encounters. This suggested that a functional
map-to-action relevant for expressing sequential content as described in the hippocampus36
could differ between Magel2+m/-p mice and WT controls for perceiving the degree of social
novelty. Perhaps, new social encounters are seen as threatening more than rewarding by
Magel2+m/-p mice, resulting in the mobilization of alternate circuit pathways that influence
behavioral response. For instance, threats, unpredictability and social anxiety activate the BNST
in which the lesion of AVP cells specifically, reduced social anxiety and aggressiveness43,44.
Many brain regions among which the PVN and BNST induced c-Fos and either Oxtr or Avpr(s)
if conspecific odors came from healthy individuals or sick individuals, respectively. Further
blockade of AVPR inhibited social avoidance to sick odors45, thus providing evidence that
socially evoked activation of AVP BNST cells is an appropriate response to threats that
Magel2+m/-p mice may privilege even with healthy conspecific. In fact, activation of LSD
neurons, a region rich of AVP fibers, inhibits aggressive behavior in mice via its projections to
the ventromedial hypothalamus46. In Magel2+m/-p mice, c-Fos activation was elevated in all
septal areas under isolation, failing to respond upon social encounters unlike healthy controls,
indicating a possible conflict between social perception and theta paced neuronal activation in
the social brain network27. Despite their social disabilities, Magel2+m/-p mice perform well with
object exploration, exhibiting correlated activities with theta rhythmicity. This contrasts with the
WT mice that did not show such correlated activities in the object trials. In agreement, the
sensitivity for discriminating faces and objects was reported respectively, impaired and
enhanced in adolescents with ASD47 which adds to the face validity of the Magel2+m/-p mice as
model of ASD.
Abnormalities in the OXT PVN-LS pathway were less prominent than in the AVP
system of Magel2+m/-p mice. This is surprising considering the alteration of oxytocinergic
neurons function described in Magel2+m/-p mice48 but could be due to compensatory mechanisms
on post-synaptic target cells in the LSD such as the replacement of type III neurons by the type
II or such as the increase of OXT fibers in the LS. Besides the apparent disarray between AVP
and OXT septal releases in Magel2+m/-p mice, abnormal septal response to social salience
hormones corresponded to the underrepresentation of type III neurons belonging to the LS-MS
pathway previously described as sequence generator linked with the hippocampus37,49. These
neurons, which are unconditionally inhibited by AVPR, must gain competence to be inhibited
by OXTR thereby operating as detectors of coincidence organizing the orderly sequence of AVP
and OXT septal response within a functional map-to-action. Despite the septum of Magel2+m/-p
mice is ill equipped, promoting AVPR septal response during social novelty restored social
behavior more efficiently than by stimulation of OXTR septal response during social
habituation. Therefore, restoring a complete orderly sequence of AVPR and OXTR septal
releases is essential for organizing sequential content of social salience signals. This mechanism
could also have implications for treating human pathologies given that activity of the
hypothalamoseptal areas was associated with affiliative emotion50, and that OXT given
intranasally increases the functional connectivity between the septum and other key areas of the
social salience and reward circuits51.
Therapeutic priming of AVPR septal response for a few minutes at the time of social
novelty restored social discrimination more than 1h later by a mechanism requiring OXTR
septal response in Magel2+m/-p mice. Molecular and electrophysiological studies provided some
clues to understand this effect. First, AVP-deficient Bratteleboro rats centrally administered

with AVP corrected for several hours the frequency deficit of theta rhythm52. Second, AVPR
and OXTR responses overlap in the septum where theta paced sequence of cells assemblies
projecting to the hippocampus are modulated by OXT and AVP53. Third, sequential content of
AVP and OXT in septum is suspected to modify theta paced network activity during social
encounter. Consistent with an AVPR priming effect in the LS, AVP stimulation of LS neurons
was previously shown to condition subsequent excitatory response to glutamatergic inputs from
the hippocampus in rats54,55. Fourth, cells detecting the coincidence of AVP and OXT sequential
content are underrepresented in septum of Magel2+m/-p mice. They are GABAergic somatostatinpositive cells (type III) projecting to MS likely equipped with both AVPR and OXTR.
Unfortunately, this remains an open question, as d[Lys(Alexa-Fluor-647)8]VP did not allow for
co-labeling of OXTR and AVPR. Lack of AVPR priming during social novelty impaired theta
paced information flow through the septum to express social salience by OXTR modulation
during habituation. So, therapeutic AVPR priming of Magel2+m/-p mice should restore septal
network activity in response to social encounter. Consistently, intranasal administration of AVP
(but not OXT) increased reciprocated collaboration between humans and its associated
reactivity in the LS56 even several days beyond treatment57.
In terms of clinical perspectives, it is encouraging that priming of septal AVPR can be
achieved even by a cryptic source of AVP (e.g. the BNST-LS pathway), further illustrating that
circuit defects can be alleviated by loading the septum with AVP at the right time. Moreover,
theta paced septal activity and its modulation by social salience hormones is an opportunity to
use EEG recordings for predicting social behavior outcomes as demonstrated in this study and
others27. In humans, EEG abnormalities and epilepsy have been reported in patients with PWS58
and ASD59. Few studies reported deficits of social task-related EEG power spectrum changes in
ASD patients60,61. Here, we provide not only an EEG signature of social disabilities in
Magel2+m/-p mice but also a blueprint of traces specific for AVPR and OXTR modulations in
mouse septum corroborated in rats53. Future research will focus on improving an EEG predictive
marker of the sensitivity to AVP and OXT in related pathologies and therapies. This is
particularly relevant in pathologies such as PWS, SYS and ASD because of the heterogeneity of
clinical features and the responses to treatments (e.g. bumetamide62 and oxytocin63).

Figure 6. Stimulation of the BNST-LS AVP pathway and PVN-LS OXT pathway restored social
behavior in Magel2+m/-p mice.

(a) Time Magel2+m/-p mice explored WT conspecifics after intraseptal injection of AVP (3.10-6 M) with or without
atosiban (5.10-8 M) at T1. Data (means±SEM) expressed as % relative to T1 in each group of n=13NaCl, 12AVP
and 6AVP+atosiban mice. Two-way ANOVA: Effect of social trials: p<0.0001 post-hoc Dunnett test for the effect
of NaCl: T4 vs T1 *p<0.0001; effect of AVP: T4 vs T1 *p<0.0001 and T4 vs T5 *p=0.01; effect of AVP+atosiban:
T4 vs T1 *p<0.0001.
(b) Net changes of EEG power in the theta band between trials correlated with time of social interaction. Pearson
coefficient if NaCl injected at T1: r=-0.08, p=0.6; if AVP injected at T1: r=0.49, *p=0.024; if AVP+atosiban
injected at T1: r=0.3, p=0.18.
(c) Time Magel2+m/-p mice explored WT conspecifics after blue light stimulation (473nm, 30Hz, 10ms pulses for
2min, 2mW) of OXT neuron projections between PVN and LS (PVN-LS pathway). Data (means±SEM) expressed
as % relative to T1 in each group of n=12 no stim, 12 stim mice. Two-way ANOVA: Effect of ChR2 stim on social
trials: p=0.0037 post-hoc Dunnett test for the effect of no stim: T3 vs T1 *p=0.035; effect of ChR2 stim: T3 vs T1
*p=0.016 T3 vs T4 *p=0.029 and T3 vs T5 *p=0.0318.
(d) Net changes of EEG power in the theta band between trials correlated with time of social interaction after
optogenetic stimulation of PVN-LS OXT terminals. Pearson coefficient if no stim at T3: r=-0.2, p=0.47; if ChR2
stim at T3: r=0.62, *p=0.01.
(e) Time Magel2+m/-p mice explored WT conspecifics after blue light stimulation (473nm, 20Hz, 5ms pulses for
2min, 2mW) of AVP neuron projections between BNST and LS (BNST-LS pathway) or PVN and LS (PVN-LS
pathway). Data (means±SEM) expressed as % relative to T1 in each group of n=9 no stim, 6 stim BNST-LS mice
and 9 no stim, 9 stim PVN-LS mice. (Left) Two-way ANOVA: Effect of ChR2 in PVN-LS on social trials: p=0.2
post-hoc Dunnett test for the effect of no stim: T4 vs T1 *p=0.0008 and T4 vs T5 p=0.75; effect of stim: T4 vs T1
p=0.16 and T4 vs T5 p=0.6. (Right) Two-way ANOVA: Effect of ChR2 in BSNT-LS on social trials: p=0.005 post-
