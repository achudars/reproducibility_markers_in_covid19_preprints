Abstract
The rapid development of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies is revealing an
unexpectedly large degree of heterogeneity in gene expression levels across the different cells
that compose the same tissue sample. However, little is known on the functional
consequences of this heterogeneity and the contribution of individual cell-fate decisions to the
collective behavior of the tissues these cells are part of. Mechanistic models of signaling
pathways have already proven to be useful tools for understanding relevant aspects of cell
functionality. Here we propose to use this mechanistic modeling strategy to deconvolute the
complexity of the functional behavior of a tissue by dissecting it into the individual functional
landscapes of its component cells by using a single-cell RNA-seq experiment of glioblastoma
cells. This mechanistic modeling analysis revealed a high degree of heterogeneity at the scale
of signaling circuits, suggesting the existence of a complex functional landscape at single cell
level. Different clusters of neoplastic glioblastoma cells have been characterized according to
their differences in signaling circuit activity profiles, which only partly overlap with the
conventional glioblastoma subtype classification. The activity of signaling circuits that trigger
cell functionalities which can easily be assimilated to cancer hallmarks reveals different
functional strategies with different degrees of aggressiveness followed by any of the clusters.
In addition, mechanistic modeling allows simulating the effect of interventions on the
components of the signaling circuits, such as drug inhibitions. Thus, effects of drug inhibitions
at single cell level can be dissected, revealing for the first time the mechanisms that individual
cells use to avoid the effect of a targeted therapy which explain why and how a small
proportion of cells display, in fact, different degrees of resistance to the treatment. The results
presented here strongly suggest that mechanistic modeling at single cell level not only allows
uncovering the molecular mechanisms of the tumor progression but also can predict the
success of a treatment and can contribute to a better definition of therapeutic targets in the
future.

Introduction
Since the beginning of the century, transcriptomic technologies, which evolved from
microarrays (1) to RNA-seq (2), have provided and increasingly accurate insight into mRNA
expression (3). The technological advances of RNA-seq technologies have increased the
resolution in the quantification of transcripts until the unprecedented level of the mRNA
component of individual single cells. The possibility of studying gene expression at the single
cell level opens the door to novel biological questions which were not possible using current
tissue‐level RNA sequencing approaches. For example, single‐cell RNA‐sequencing (scRNA‐seq)
has allowed a high-resolution analysis of developmental trajectories (4,5), the detailed
characterization of tissues(6,7), the identification of rare cell types (8), or the analysis of
stochastic gene expression and transcriptional kinetics (9,10), just to cite a few cases.
The continuous publication of scRNA-seq studies is producing an increasingly large wealth of
data on cell-level gene activity measurements under countless conditions. However, the
functional consequences of such gene activity at single cell level remains mostly unknown.
Among the many methods and applications published for the management of scRNA-seq data
(11), only a small proportion of them provide some functional insights on the results. For
example, MetaNeighbor (12), SCDE (13) or PAGODA (14), annotate cell types based on
conventional gene set enrichment analysis (15,16). Other algorithms, such as SCENIC (17), PIDC
(18), SCODE (19) or SINCERITIES (20), offer the possibility of inferring regulatory networks as
well. However, functional profiling methods have evolved from the analysis of simple gene sets
or inferred regulatory gene networks to more sophisticated computational systems biology
approaches that allow a mechanistic understanding on how molecular cell signaling networks
enables cells to make cell-fate decisions that ultimately define a healthy tissue or organ, and
how deregulation of this signaling network lead to pathologic conditions (21-23). Specifically,
mechanistic models have helped to understand the disease mechanisms behind different
cancers (24-27), rare diseases (28,29), the mechanisms of action of drugs (29,30), and other
physiologically interesting scenarios such as obesity (31) or the post-mortem cell behavior of a
tissue (32). Although there are several mechanistic modeling algorithms available that model
different aspects of signaling pathway activity, Hipathia (24) has demonstrated to outperform
other competing algorithms in terms of sensitivity and specificity (23).
Here, we propose the use of mechanistic models of signaling activities (24,33) that trigger cell
functionalities related with cancer hallmarks (34), as well as other cancer-related relevant
cellular functions to understand the consequences of gene expression profiles on cell
functionality at single cell level. Such mechanistic models use gene expression data to produce
an estimation of activity profiles of signaling circuits defined within pathways (24,33). An
additional advantage of mechanistic models is that they can be used not only to understand
molecular mechanisms of disease or of drug action but also to predict the potential
consequences of gene perturbations over the circuit activity in a given condition (35). Actually,
in a recent work, our group has successfully predicted therapeutic targets in cancer cell lines
with a precision over 60% (25).
An interesting model to be studied from the viewpoint of mechanistic models is glioblastoma,
the most common and aggressive of gliomas (36). Glioblastoma current treatment includes
maximal safe surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy (37), often
combined with other drugs such as bevacizumab in an attempt of overcoming resistances (38).
Despite this intense treatment, the mean survival of glioblastoma patients is only 15 months

and resistances to the therapy are quite common (39-41). This high rate of treatment
failure has been attributed to the lack of specific therapies for individual tumor types
(42,43). Moreover, it is well known that glioblastoma tumors with a common morphologic
diagnosis display a high heterogeneity at the genomic level (44).
The availability of glioblastoma single cell gene expression data (45) provides a unique
opportunity to understand the behavior of a cancer type at the cell level. Here, we show for
the first time how mechanistic models applied at single-cell level provide an unprecedentedly
detailed dissection of the tumor into functional profiles at the scale of individual cells that
throw new light on how cells ultimately determine its behavior. Moreover, since mechanistic
models allow simulating interventions on the system studied, we show a comprehensive
simulation of the potential effect of drugs at single cell level that disclose, for the first time, the
mechanisms and strategies used by subpopulations of cells to evade the effect of the drug.

Results
Selection of the optimal imputation method
Since mechanistic models take into account the topology of signaling circuits to estimate signal
transduction activity in the cell, the discrimination between genes with missing expression
values and genes that are not expressed is crucial, given that, depending on the location of the
gene within the circuit, it can play the role of a switch. Since dropout events (the observation
of a gene at a moderate expression level in one cell that cannot be detected in another cell)
are quite common in scRNA-seq experiments (46), and taking them as zero values can cause
dramatic effects on the inferred activity of the circuit, the use of imputation methods is crucial
for the application of the mechanistic model. Among the best performer imputation methods
available (47), three of them were checked to decide which one is optimal in the context of
signaling pathway activity inference: MAGIC (48), SCimpute (49) and Drimpute(50).
In order to decide what imputation method produced the most realistic results we used the
clustering produced in the original single cell glioblastoma study (45) as ground truth. There,
the authors applied tSNE (51) over the 500 most variable and highly expressed genes and then
cluster the resulting data with k-means. They found 12 main clusters with a homogeneous cell
composition that was further experimentally validated, which were: Astrocytes, two Myeloid
cell clusters, three Neoplastic cell clusters, Neurons, Oligodendrocytes, OPCs and three
Vascular cell clusters. Then, gene expression values were imputed using the above-mentioned
methods (MAGIC, SCimpute and Drimpute). Next, gene expression values were used to infer
signaling circuit activities with the Hipathia algorithm (24) as implemented in the Bioconductor
application (52). The values of circuit activity were subjected to the same procedure (tSNE
dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering) and the resulting clusters were compared to
the original ones obtained in the glioblastoma study using the Rand index (53). Figure 1A
shows the clustering obtained with the genes following the procedure described above
(equivalent to the Figure 2 of the original study (45)), which can be compared with the
clustering of the samples using the circuit activities obtained with the gene expression values
imputed with SCimpute (Figure 1B), Drimpute (Figure 1C) and MAGIC (Figure 1D) The
comparison of the clusters obtained with the three imputation methods were SCImpute:
0.745, DrImpute: 0.852 and MAGIC: 0.858. Although MAGIC rendered a slightly better rand
coefficient, Drimpute was chosen as imputation method because the dispersion of the clusters
obtained was very similar to the one observed in the ground truth clustering (Figure 1A).

Functional characterization of cancer cells
Once verified that cell types defined by gene expression profiles (45) are supported by
signaling profiles as well, the obvious comparison is the glioblastoma cell clusters versus the
clusters composed by the different brain cells (oligodendrocytes, neurons, astrocytes and
OPCs). Since circuits activity bridges gene expression to signaling activity and ultimately cell
functionality, an assessment of the differences between cell types from a functional
perspective can be achieved by means of a differential cell activity statistical contrast. The cell
functional responses triggered by the circuits differentially activated can be easily retrieved,
and among them, those related with cancer hallmarks (34) can be identified using the CHAT

tool (54), as explained in methods.

In order to detect which circuits display a significant change in activity, the three
neoplastic cell clusters (1, 2 and 3 in Figure 1C) are compared to the normal cells brain

The comparison between the neoplastic clusters and the brain normal cells resulted in two
different patterns of circuit activity: neoplastic clusters 1 and 3 present a higher number of
signaling circuits differentially activated (309 and 336, respectively) than neoplastic cluster 2
(only 96 circuits). Figure 2 represents the number of differentially activated signaling circuits
involved in cancer hallmarks observed in the three neoplastic cell clusters. This representation
provides a summary of the strategy used by any particular neoplastic cluster in terms of the
number of signaling circuits that control cell functionalities identifiable as cancer hallmarks.

number of circuits annotated to any of the cancer hallmarks. Table 1 summarizes the number
of signaling circuits related to cancer hallmarks common to the three clusters (first column)
and specific for each cancer type (subsequent columns). The common functional signature of
this cancer is clearly driven by circuits related to Resisting cell death, Sustaining proliferative
signaling and Enabling replicative immortality hallmarks, completed with circuits related to
Evading growth suppressors, Inducing angiogenesis and Tumor promoting inflammation
hallmarks. From Figure 1 it becomes apparent that neoplastic clusters 1 and 3 are using a
functional strategy different from that used by neoplastic cluster 2. The first two ones display a
functional signature compatible with a more aggressive behavior: they have many extra
circuits related to Resisting cell death, Sustaining proliferative signaling hallmarks but, in
addition, both clusters have circuit activity related to Deregulation of cellular energetic,
Genome instability and mutation as well as Invasion and metastasis hallmarks (see Table 1 and
Figure 2C for a detail). Conversely, neoplastic cluster 2 does not seem to have much more
extra functional activity beyond the common functional signature, which suggests a less
aggressive character, especially because of the absence of circuit activity related to cell
energetic or to invasion and metastasis.

Functional based stratification of glioblastoma cells
Neoplastic clusters have been defined according to the individual profiles of signaling circuit
activities observed for each cell. The advantage of this way of cell stratification is that the
functional profiles of each group are well defined. Current glioblastoma classification stratifies
tumors into three subtypes, classical, proneural, and mesenchymal, from less to more
aggressive, based on the signature of 50 genes (55). The SubtypeME tool from the GlioVis data
portal (56) was used to assign subtype to each individual cell. Interestingly, when cells of the
three neoplastic clusters are typed, the distribution of markers is very coherent with their
functional activity profiles. Thus, Neoplastic cluster 2 is mainly composed by cells belonging to
the classical subtype (see Table 2), in coincidence with its functional profile less aggressive. On
the other hand, Neoplastic cluster 2 has an important component of proneural cells, as well as
a smaller proportion of mesenchymal cells, which is coherent with its more aggressive
functionality triggered by its signaling activity, which includes modifications in circuits related
to cell metabolism, genomic instability and metastasis. Moreover, the functional profile of
Neoplastic cluster 3 seems to be even more aggressive than that of Neoplastic cluster 1. This
group of glioblastoma cells not only has more circuits related to the same hallmarks that

Neoplastic cluster 1 but also has circuits that trigger functionalities for Avoiding immune
destruction (Table 2 and Figure 1). It is interesting noticing that, although the conventional
stratification in Classical, Mesenchymal and Proneural classes is illustrative of the behavior of
the cells it does not completely fit with the stratification based on whole cell functional
profiles.

Effect of a drug at single cell level
Mechanistic models can be used to simulate the effect of an intervention over the system
studied (25,35). Specifically, single cell transcriptomic data offers, for the first time, the
possibility of modeling the effects of a targeted drug at the level of individual cells.

Figure 3.Impact of the inhibition of VEGFA by bevacizumab over the different neoplastic cells in terms of
changes in the activities of signaling circuits in which this protein participates. The Y axis depicts the
magnitude of this change in the activities of signaling circuits.

The current indication for glioblastoma patients treatment is temozolomide which induces
DNA damage, that can be combined with other drugs such as bevacizumab to overcome
resistances (38). Moreover, bevacizumab, which is indicated for several advanced cancer
types, has recently been suggested for glioblastoma targeted treatment (57-59). Actually, the
effect of bevacizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular
endothelial growth factor ligand (VEGFA), can easily be simulated in the mechanistic model.

VEGFA gene participates in 6 pathways (VEGF signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, Rap1
signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and Focal adhesion)
and is part of 81 circuits, 39 of them directly related to cancer hallmarks (18 to Resisting cell
death, 9 to Sustaining proliferative signaling, 4 to Genomic instability and mutation, 3 to
Evading growth suppressors, 2 to Enabling replicative immortality, 2 to Inducing angiogenesis
and 1 to Deregulation of cellular energetic). As described in methods, the inhibition of VEGFA
can be simulated by taking the gene expression profile of a single cell, creating a simulated
profile by setting the inhibited gene to a low value and comparing two profiles (24,35).

transduction role with other 12 proteins (PDGFA, HGF, VEGFB, PDGFC, EGF, PDGFD, PGF, VEGFC, IGF1,

signaling pathway the protein VEGFA is the only signal transducer in the node.

Figure 3 shows the impact of the inhibition of VEGFA on the different cells in terms of changes
in the activities of signaling circuits in which this protein participates. The Y axis depicts the
magnitude of this change in the activities of signaling circuits. There are clearly two different
behaviors in the response: most of the cells present a drastic change in many signaling circuit
activities (responders) while a smaller number of them present a much lower affectation on
them (low-responders). Interestingly, most of the cells with a low-response to bevacizumab
are typed as Mesenchimal.
A close look at the consequences of the inhibition of VEGFA in different cells provides an
interesting explanation for the observed differences. VEGFA is upstream in the chain of signal
transduction in several circuits of different pathways. In the circuits within Ras signaling
pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, the VEGFA protein
potentially share the role of signal transducer with other 40 proteins. Figure 4A clearly depicts
how the balance between the expression level of VEGFA in the responsive cells and KITLG and
FGF2 proteins, that can take a similar signaling role, changes. The inhibition of VEGFA in the
responsive cells will radically inhibit the signal. However, the low-responsive cells have already
VEGFA at low expression levels and the signal is transmitted by KITLG and FGF2 instead, which
ultimately compromises the success of the drug. A similar scenario occurs with the Focal
adhesion pathway, in which VEGFA shares the signal transduction role with other 12 proteins.
In this case, the low-responder cells are characterized by a low level of VEGFA compensated
with a high level of PDGFD, which makes these signaling circuits in the low-responding cells
virtually insensitive to the inhibition of VEGFA (see Figure 4B). Only in the case of 6 signaling
circuits belonging to the HIF signaling pathway and VEGF signaling pathway the protein VEGFA
is the only signal transducer in the node. In this case, low-responder cells have this circuit
constitutively down and, consequently, are not affected by the inhibition (Figure 4C).
The same modeling strategy used with bevacizumab can be applied to simulate the effect of
other drugs. Recently, a drug repurposing in silico experiment which combines human genomic
data with mouse phenotypes has suggested the possible utility of a number of drugs with
different indications (see Table 3) for potential glioblastoma treatment (60). The intensity and
the degree of heterogeneity in the response are very variable across the 8 drugs tested here.
At the scale we tested the drugs, there are no correlations neither between the number of
genes targeted by the drug and the intensity of the effect nor between the number of circuits
potentially affected and the intensity of the effect. For example, Pentoxifylline targets 4 genes
(PDE4B, ADORA1, PDE4A and ADORA2A) which participate in a total of 111 circuits and the
fold change caused in the circuit activity after simulating its effect is comparatively low (log
fold change < 0.05 for all the cell types; see Supplementary Figure 1), while the simulation of
the effect of Fenofibrate, which targets only one gene PPARA that participates in only 32
circuits renders a comparatively high effect (log fold change > 2 for all the cell types; see
Supplementary Figure 1). It is interesting to note that, depending on the case, the different
drug effects simulated can affect to a larger or to a smaller number of cells with distinct
intensity in their impacts on the activity of the signaling circuits affected, but always, no matter
what drug is simulated, there are some cells that manage to escape to the inhibitory effect of
the drug.

Discussion
The goal of most scRNA-seq publications revolves around the characterization of cell
populations, which can be accurately achieved using only a subset of the total number of

genes (those displaying the highest variability across cells). However, the use of mechanistic
models to estimate global signaling circuit activity profiles for individual cells requires of
reasonably accurate measures of the expression levels of all the genes involved in the signaling
circuits. Dropout events, quite common in scRNA-seq experiments (46), are particularly
problematic given that taking by mistake a missing value by a real zero value can cause
erroneous determinations of the inferred activity of the circuits. Thus, we explored the
performance of three different imputation methods in producing cell-specific profiles of
signaling circuit activity whose clustering resulted in a grouping similar to that observed and
validated in the original glioblastoma study. Here, two machine learning based methods,
DRImpute and MAGIC, produced a clustering compatible with the original validated clustering,
and specifically, Drimpute, the method of choice, rendered clusters with a similar shape as well
(see Figure 1).
Focusing on neoplastic cells, the existence of three different clusters is also apparent at the
level of functional profiles, which suggests the existence of different functional behaviors.
Several attempts to stratify glioblastoma patients have been proposed by discriminating
different subtypes according to different properties, such as patient survival (61) mutational
status of some genes (62) or the tumor microenvironment (63). In the most used classification,
glioblastoma tumors were divided into three subtypes (from less to more aggressive: classical,
proneural, and mesenchymal) based on the signature of 50 genes (55). Although this
conventional subtyping provides an approximate descriptor of tumor aggressiveness,
subtyping based on functional profiles related to cancer hallmarks provides an interesting
alternative for the stratification of glioblastoma that offers, in addition, a mechanistic
description on the functional activity of the tumor. Actually, it has been reported in
neuroblastoma that signaling pathway models used as biomarkers outperform traditional
biomarkers as predictors of patient survival (26).
Among pathways that are commonly altered in all three clusters we find well known factors
contributing to carcinogenesis, such as those related to hypoxia (HIF-1, SOD2), cancer stem
cells (CSCs), cell cycle proteins, like CDK family, signal transduction pathways and hormone
signaling (64-66). Moreover, these are mainly related to Sustaining proliferative signaling,
Enabling replicative immortality and Resisting cell death hallmarks that can be defined as the
core cell functions involved in glioblastoma initiation and proliferation.
Each cluster exhibits a characteristic deregulation of pathways, however, cluster 2 barely has
four unique sub-pathways, all related to common hallmarks Resisting cell death and Sustaining
proliferative signaling. Neoplastic clusters 1 and 3, but no cluster 2, exhibit Genome instability,
a hallmark observed in almost all sporadic human cancers, including glioblastoma (67,68).
Besides, cluster 1 and 3, show deregulated Cellular energetics, a process that has been
suggested as a suitable target for tumor cell elimination (69). Furthermore, both clusters show
pathways associated with matrix metalloproteins and Snail family that have been linked to
cancer invasion and metastasis also in glioblastoma (70-72). Interestingly, only cluster 3 may
be avoiding immune destruction due to the deregulation of Toll-like receptor signaling
pathway. Glioblastoma is known to have a strongly immunosuppressive microenvironment,
thus blocking these cells by activating downstream TLR signaling pathways can reduce tumor
growth and disrupt CSC self-renewal (73,74).
We have demonstrated that not all the cells in a tumor are driven by the same cancer

different aggressiveness and invasion abilities, highlighting the relevance of heterogeneity,
beyond the widely accepted stratification of glioblastoma in three/four subtypes (75,76).
The emergence of mechanisms of resistance in targeted therapies has been attributed to
either the selection of rare pre-existing genetic alterations upon drug treatment (77) or the
transient acquisition of a drug-refractory phenotype by a small proportion of cancer cells
through epigenetic modifications (78). In both cases, these alterations would be detectable in
the expression of the corresponding genes. An interesting property of mechanistic models is
that they can be used to model the effect of an intervention over the system studied (25,35).
Thus, the use of mechanistic models on single cell transcriptomic data offers for the first time
the possibility of modeling the effects of a targeted drug in individual cells. From Figure 4 it
becomes apparent that low-responder cells have a constitutive level of VEGFA lower than
highly-responder cells, either with the relevant role of signal transduction taken by other
proteins to keep the circuit active or simply with the circuit already inactive. Thus, the
mechanistic model provides a simple explanation of the molecular mechanisms behind the
differential effect of drugs over cells with different signaling profiles that ultimately cause
different functional strategies.
Supplementary Figure 1 depicts the simulated response of individual cells to the treatment
with different targeted drugs. Despite the variety of effects that cause in the cells, It is worth
noticing that there is always a group of cells that manage to escape to the inhibition of the
drug. The heterogeneity observed in the cell population in terms of use of different strategies
to activate the essential cancer hallmark through different signaling circuits, produces a
consequent diversity in the response to drugs. Although the number of drugs simulated is
relatively low, given that drug repurposing was beyond the scope of this paper, the results
obtained here suggest that the escape of a relatively small number of cells to the effect of the
drug could be a relatively frequent event that occurs as a natural consequence of the
heterogeneity in the signaling strategies followed by the cell population. When this
subpopulation becomes dominant some time later, it results to be resistant to the drug.

Conclusions
The use of mechanistic models provides a detailed insight into the functional strategies used
by tumors to proliferate and open new avenues for the design of interventions a la carte. The
extension of this analytic approach to single cell transcriptomic data allows an unprecedented
detail on how cancer cells display different functional strategies to proliferate that have
consequences in their respective vulnerabilities to targeted therapies.
Although the existence of resistant clones in a tumoral cell population is well known, the
specific mechanisms used by resistant cells to escape from the inhibitory effects of targeted
therapies remain unknown yet. Mechanistic models offer for the first time a plausible and
contrastable hypothesis on how and why some cells are insensitive to treatments, illustrated
here with bevacizumab in the case of glioblastoma. The use of this modeling strategy offers a
systematic way for detecting tumoral cells that may be resistant to specific targeted
treatments. Conversely, the same models could be used to find an alternative treatment for
resistant drugs. In fact our results suggests that the search for new, more efficient therapeutic
targets would be very benefited of the use of mechanistic models that guide to the
intervention points with more likelihood of success in inhibiting the proliferation of the largest
possible part of the spectrum of functional strategies in the tumor cell ecosystem.

Material and methods
Data and primary processing
A large scRNA-seq dataset containing 3589 cells of different types obtained in four patients
from a glioblastoma study (45) was downloaded from GEO (GSE84465). Cells corresponded to
the tumor, and to the periphery of the tumor.
Count values for the scRNA-seq were downloaded from GEO and subjected to the three
imputation methods, MAGIC (48), SCimpute (49) and Drimpute (50), as implemented in the
corresponding software packages. Each method has its own preprocessing pipeline explained
in the corresponding publication.
Once imputed, samples were log-transformed and a truncation by quantile 0.99 was applied.
Finally, the values were normalized between 0 and 1, as required by the downstream
functional analysis with Hipathia.

Hipathia mechanistic model
The Hipathia method uses KEGG pathways (79) to define circuits that connect any possible
receptor protein to specific effector proteins. Gene expression values are used in the context
of these circuits to model signaling activity, that ultimately trigger specific cell activities, are as
described in (24). A total of 98 KEGG pathways involving a total of 3057 genes that form part of
4726 nodes were used to define a total of 1287 signaling circuits. The intensity value of signal
transduced to the effector is estimated by the following recursive formula:

𝑆𝑆𝑛𝑛 = 𝜐𝜐𝑛𝑛 ∙ �1 − �(1 − 𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑎 )� ⋅ �(1 − 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 )
𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑎 ∈𝐴𝐴

(1)

𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 ∈𝐼𝐼

where Sn is the signal intensity for the current node n, vn is its normalized gene expression
value, A is the set of activation signals (sa), arriving to the current node from activation edges, I
is the set of inhibitory signals (si) arriving to the node from inhibition edges (24).
The Hipathia algorithm (27) is implemented as an R package available in Bioconductor (52) as
well as in a web server (80) and as a Cytoscape application (81).

Differential signaling activity
Two groups of circuit activity profiles can be compared and the differences in activity of any
circuit can be tested by means of different tests, among which limma (82) has demonstrated to
be very efficient.

Signaling circuits associated to cancer hallmarks
Each effector is known to be associated to one or several cell functions. This information is
extracted both from the Uniprot (83) and Gene Ontology (84) annotations corresponding to
the effector gene (24). However, in some cases the annotations are too ambiguous or make

reference to roles of the gene in many different conditions, tissues, developmental stages,
etc., making thus difficult to understand its ultimate functional role. In addition, in this study
the activity of signaling circuits relevant in cancer is particularly interesting. Since a number of
these effector genes has been related specifically with one or several cancer hallmarks (34) in
the scientific literature, the CHAT tool (54), a text mining based application to organize and
evaluate scientific literature on cancer that allows linking gene names with cancer hallmarks.

Subtyping of cancer cells
The SubtypeME tool from the GlioVis data portal (56) was used to obtain the subtype of cancer
(classical, proneural or mesenchymal), based on the signature of 50 genes (55). This tool
provides three methods to assign subtype: Single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(ssGSEA), K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and Supported vector machine (SVM). Subtype was
assigned when at least two of the methods made an identical subtype prediction.
