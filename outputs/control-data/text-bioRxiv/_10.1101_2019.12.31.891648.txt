Abstract (190)

20

Patterns of size variation in fish are supposed to be generated by growth differences, not by egg or

21

hatchling size variation. However, annual killifish live in temporary ponds with a limited time period

22

available for growth and reproduction. It has therefore been hypothesized that among annual

23

killifish, hatchling size variation should be of large relative importance to generate adaptive adult

24

size variation. Using growth curves of 203 individuals from 18 Austrolebias species raised in a

25

common environment, we demonstrate that hatchling size variation indeed is a main determinant of

26

adult size variation in annual killifish, in agreement with the time constraint hypothesis.

27

Furthermore, we find an increased early growth rate in piscivorous species augmenting their

28

difference in size from small congeneric species. This should be adaptive if size differences

29

determine predation success. Environmental effects of spatial location of the population of origin on

30

hatchling size and growth suggest that the time constraint might be weakened in populations

31

occurring near the Atlantic coast. Our study reveals how extreme environments demand specific life

32

history solutions to achieve adaptive size variation and that there might be scope for local

33

adaptations in growth trajectories.

Introduction

36
37

Body size differences are seen as key to understanding life history variation (Roff 1993). Teleost fish

38

alone are spanning nearly nine orders of magnitude in mature size and this is supposed to be due to

39

evolved differences in growth, not to size variation at hatching (Sibly et al 2015). At the same time,

40

there is enormous variation in life cycles among teleost fish and in the ecological and evolutionary

41

variability affecting size differences between closely related species and between and within

42

populations (Hutchings 2002). For example, Atlantic salmon vary 14-fold in size at maturity between

43

populations (Hutchings and Jones 1998) and this variability has been linked to temperature-

44

dependent growth (Jonsson et al 2013).

45

Size variation and adaptation in fish is much studied in the context of size-selective harvesting (Law

46

2007). The topic has spurred a modelling effort to support arguments that responses of populations

47

to size-selective harvesting are adaptive (Ernande et al. 2004). Other modelling studies have aimed

48

to predict how competition can affect the emergence of size differences within populations or

49

between species. For example, Persson et al (2000) and Claessen et al (2000) have shown that

50

significant size differences can emerge within fish populations as a consequence of competition for

51

food and cannibalism, leading to so-called dwarfs and giants. Van Dooren et al. (2018) referred to

52

these studies to propose that large piscivorous annual killifish and their prey evolved in sympatry

53

due to a similar scenario of adaptation. Metabolic scaling studies such as Sibly et al (2015) then state

54

that such size differences between fish species must be due to slower or faster juvenile growth,

55

whereas all individuals within a species should grow as fast as environmental conditions for

56

development and metabolism permit. This theory implies that size differences within and between

57

populations can then only be explained by different environmental conditions which individuals

58

experience, leaving little or no room for adaptive variation in the use of resources to achieve

59

particular body sizes. On top of that, expected relative growth rates in fish are expected to decrease

with age (Pauly 1979) such that initial growth differences and initial environments have larger

61

effects on adult size.

62
63

Within the toothcarps (Cyprinodontiformes), annual killifish have evolved at least five times from

64

non-annual species (Furness et al 2015, Helmstetter et al 2016). Annualism denotes that these

65

species inhabit ephemeral waters and that their life history strategy resembles that of annual plants:

66

they establish egg banks where embryos survive dry periods by going through one or several

67

diapauses during development (Wourms 1972). Large size differences among closely related annual

68

killifish species have evolved repeatedly (Costa 2011). Within the genus Austrolebias which occurs in

69

South-American temperate environments, large size evolved from small (Van Dooren et al 2018,

70

Helmstetter et al. 2018) and adult body lengths range from about three centimeter to fifteen (Costa

71

2006), corresponding to a more than hundredfold difference in volume. One of the clades with large

72

species in Austrolebias have become specialized piscivores (Costa 2011, Van Dooren et al 2018). In

73

the African genus Nothobranchius there is similar size variation involving the evolution of piscivory

74

(Costa 2011, Costa 2018). This genus is well-known for its explosive growth and extremely early

75

maturity, observed both in the lab and the field (Blažek et al 2013, Vrtilek et al 2018). Within killifish,

76

adult body sizes are not only determined by growth variability as Sibly et al (2015) predicted.

77

Eckerström‐Liedholm et al. (2017) found that egg sizes in annual fish are larger than in non-annual

78

toothcarp species and explained this as an adaptation to environments with time constraints on

79

growth periods such as the temporary ponds annual fish inhabit. By being born from larger eggs,

80

annual killifish achieve large (adaptive) sizes by increasing hatchling size instead of growing longer.

81

We investigated in a common garden lab context and using the South-American annual killifish

82

genus Austrolebias how both small and large species in this genus achieve the size differences

83

known from the field and the lab (Figure one). We aimed to identify the major axis among different

84

components contributing to size variation (Schluter 1996): either growth variation (Sibly et al 2015)

85

or hatchling size variation (Eckerström‐Liedholm et al 2017) might explain body size differences

86

more. Hatchlings were obtained from a range of eighteen species mostly occurring in regions close

87

to the Atlantic Ocean and these were raised individually in separate tanks to provide individual

88

growth data. Sizes were measured repeatedly over an eight weeks period. We investigated effects of

89

different environmental variables on hatchling size and growth and compared the patterns of

90

growth rates between the geographic locations of the sites of origin of the populations in our study.

91

We find that hatchling size variation makes the largest contribution to size variation between

92

species, but the relative importance of early post-hatching growth on individual size variation is

93

comparable with hatchling size. Our results thus confirm that large body sizes in some species are to

94

a large extent determined by large hatchling size and we reject the hypothesis that only growth

95

variation matters for size differences between fish species.

96
97

Material and methods

98
99

We triggered hatching of embryos of 18 Austrolebias species (Fig. 1) stored in brown peat, by

100

flooding the peat and eggs with water (15 C, 20% aged tap water, 80% RO water, peat extract). Six of

101

the species are usually classified as large and they belong to three different clades (Van Dooren et al

102

2018, Helmstetter et al 2018). Three species in this experiment are from a single clade of large

103

species containing specialized piscivores (Costa 2010). The 18 species originate from three different

104

Atlantic coastal areas of endemism (Costa 2009), with the populations in this experiment originating

105

from a single such area per species (La Plata river basin, Negro river basin, Patos coastal lagoons,

106

Helmstetter et al. 2018). In these regions, temporary ponds dry in summer. The inland seasonal

107

pattern of rainfall in the Chaco region is different. At the moment of hatching, embryos were

108

between four and forty-two months old.

110

Hatchlings that were swimming freely (with inflated swim bladder) were placed in separate 0.25 L

111

plastic raising tanks and gradually moved into increasingly larger tanks as they grew. Water

112

parameters were controlled to the following values: <12 dGH, <10 mg/L NO3, < 0.1 mg/L NO2, < 0.25

113

mg/L NH3, pH = 7.0 - 8.0, 22 ± 0.5 C, by diluting water in the raising tanks daily with water from

114

reserves stored in the same room. The fish experienced a 14L:10D photoperiod. Hatchlings were fed

115

Artemia salina nauplii daily for two weeks and then a combination of Artemia salina, Chironomid

116

larvae, Tubifex and Daphnia pulex. We ensured that the raising tanks always contained live food,

117

such that the fish could feed to satiation. Each tank contained plants (Vesicularia dubyana and

118

Egeria densa) as well as 5 g of boiled brown peat to aggregate waste and maintain water

119

parameters. At day 58, 32 fish showed visible evidence of stunting or hampered growth (bent spine -

120

extreme lack of growth) and they were assigned to a separate "stunted" category for analysis.

121
122

Photography

123

We photographed individual fish using a digital USB microscope at hatching (day 1) and repeatedly

124

after that, after intervals of increasing duration with age. We obtained up to nine measurements per

125

individual fish. We constrained the fish in small chambers and photographed from a lateral and

126

dorsal perspective or placed larger fish in a shallow water layer in a petri dish to make lateral

127

pictures only. We measured total length, the distance from anterior tip of the maxilla to the

128

posterior tip of the caudal fin, using ImageJ.

129
130

Statistical analysis

131

Van Dooren et al (2018) and Helmstetter et al (2018) investigated whether shifts in selection regimes

132

occurred for size and niche traits within Austrolebias. Helmstetter et al (2018) identified a shift to a

133

selection regime with an increased optimum size for the clade containing A. elongatus. An analysis

134

for shifts on the posterior distributions of phylogenies in Van Dooren et al (2018) found similar shifts

135

for the other clades containing large species in a fraction of trees. Niche traits showed weak

136

evidence for a niche shift in the Negro area (Helmstetter et al 2018). These results make it necessary

137

to use membership of the clades with large species and the areas of endemism as explanatory

138

variables to accommodate effects of the detected regime shifts and to accommodate other similar

139

potential shifts for the traits we investigate. The remaining species differences are then random with

140

respect to these estimated shifts and the species effects can be treated as random effects.

141
142

Survival and stunting. Next to species differences in mortality, the incidence of stunted body

143

morphologies can indicate whether the environmental conditions we imposed permit normal

144

growth. We therefore assessed survival variation between species and whether the risk of becoming

145

stunted differed between species or depended on age of the embryos at inundation. The proportion

146

of individuals alive at day 50 (before some A. wolterstorfii were moved out of the experiment into

147

bigger tanks) was analysed using a binomial generalized additive (GAM, Wood 2017) or generalized

148

linear model (GLM cCullagh and Nelder 1989). Age at hatching, membership of a clade of large

149

species (yielding three categories of large species and one small), area of endemism per species

150

(three areas) and spatial coordinates of the location where the individuals were sampled that the

151

hatchling descended from were used as explanatory variables.

152

We used scores of the two components of a principal component PC analysis carried out on latitude

153

and longitude of all ponds. The ponds are not randomly distributed across the South-American

154

continent and we wanted to use two independent explanatory variables characterizing spatial

155

locations. The scores were standardized across all observations, so that their averages would be zero

156

across each dataset analysed. We first added scores as thin plate regression splines, hence GAM

157

were fitted (Wood 2017). When model comparisons revealed that these effects should not be

158

retained in the model or when they could all be fitted as linear effects, GLM's were fitted. Model

159

selection occurred by model simplification using likelihood ratio tests (LRT smooth terms and

160

interaction terms first if present) for comparisons. The probability to become stunted in the

161

experiment was analyzed similarly. We did not include sex effects (male/female/unknown) as an

162

explanatory variable here, as an individual might end up in the “unknown” category due to stunting

163

or premature death.

164
165

Initial size. We investigated variables affecting initial size at hatching using phylogenetic linear mixed

166

models (de Villemereuil and Nakagawa 2014) and linear mixed models (Pinheiro and Bates 2000). In

167

this manner, unbalanced data can be analyzed while different sources of variation in the data are

168

addressed simultaneously. In each model, we fitted different explanatory (fixed) variables, i.e.,

169

embryo age, being classified as stunted, sex, areas of endemism, clades with large species and, as

170

above, we fitted models with the coordinate scores of capture locations. Different random effects

171

were included. In the maximal models, a random species effect with species covariances calculated

172

according the expected values under a Brownian motion model of evolution and next to that a

173

species effect with zero covariances. The expected covariances of the phylogenetic random effects

174

were calculated on the basis of a consensus nDNA tree from Helmstetter et al. (2018). We tested

175

whether including the phylogenetically structured random species effects contributed significantly

176

using a likelihood ratio test. We carried out model selection on the fixed effects as above using

177

likelihood ratio tests (Bolker et al 2009). We used function lmekin() to fit the mixed models including

178

phylogenetic random effects in R (Therneau 2012). For models which did not account for

179

phylogenetic relatedness, we used linear mixed models or generalized additive mixed models

180

(GAMM) with smooth functions to fit the scores of spatial coordinates.

182

Growth. We inspected growth curves y(t) of age t (days since hatching) using smooth functions

183

(Wood 2017), where we used thin plate regression splines of t per species and a smoothness

184

parameter shared between species (factor smooth interaction, function gam from library mgcv(),

185

option "bs=fs", Wood 2017). We found recent field data on individual size at age for three

186

Austrolebias species (Garcia et al 2018) and added these to a figure to check that our common

187

garden environment allowed individuals to grow to sizes comparable to field conditions. From two

188

lab studies, average sizes at different ages were extracted. Errea and Danulat (2001) provided an

189

average total length at age for Austrolebias viarius kept in the lab at 25C and Fonseca et al (2013)

190

provide average standard lengths for Austrolebias wolterstorffi kept at 24C.

191

Per individual, we calculated estimates of relative growth per day gi from the data as

192
1

193

𝑔𝑖 = (

𝑦𝑖+1 𝑡𝑖+1 −𝑡𝑖
)
𝑦𝑖

(Eqn. 1)

194
195

where yi and yi + 1 are successive size measurements on the same individual at ages ti and ti + 1. The

196

standard calculation of relative growth rate is the logarithm of this quantity (Hoffmann and Poorter

197

2002). We decided to integrate the instantaneous rate over a time interval of one day such that gi

198

becomes the relative increase per day which is easier to interpret. 100*(gi - 1) is the percentage

199

relative increase per day. We inspect and analyze relative increases per day at interval midpoints

200

𝑥𝑖 = (𝑡𝑖 + 𝑡𝑖+1 )/2. For illustration, we fitted smooth functions to the relative growth gi evaluated

201

at interval midpoints xi.

202
203

We investigated which variables affect relative growth as above, using generalized additive and

204

phylogenetic or non-phylogenetic mixed models. As each analysis contains several measures of

205

relative growth per individual, we added individual random effects nested within the non-

206

phylogenetic species effect. We derived an expression for the error of the relative growth

207

calculations (Supplement), which we implemented in the mixed models. However, it was

208

systematically outperformed by a variance regression for the residual variance which changed with

209

the number of days after hatching (using varExp() weights in lme(), see Pinheiro and Bates 2000).

210
211

Relative contributions of initial size and relative growth to final size variation. Final size at the end

212

of the experiment (day 58 after hatching) depends on initial size at hatching and on the cumulative

213

growth over the time interval. We can partition cumulative growth into the contributions of

214

different periods to assess their relative importance in the generation of size variation. Log-

215

transformed final size in the experiment consists of additive effects of initial size and growth as

216

shown below. This allows a useful variance decomposition (Rees et al 2010) of final size in the

217

experiment in terms of initial size and growth in different time intervals.

218

Because day 57 was the last day where the majority of fish were measured, we decomposed final

219

size of an individual 𝑦57 at day 57 of the experiment as follows:
𝐺𝑛

220

𝐺56

𝑦57 = 𝑦1 ⏞
𝑔1 𝑔2 . . . 𝑔𝑛 ⏞
𝑔𝑛+1 𝑔𝑛+2 . . . 𝑔56

(Eqn. 2)

221
222

We chose to partition the relative growth per day gi into two periods, from day one to n and from day

223

n + 1 to day 56. For the analysis presented, we chose n = 28 because this provided two intervals of

224

similar length, with a large number of individuals measured at the end of the first interval. When we

225

log-transform (Eqn. 2), we obtain a sum of contributions to log final size: ln 𝑦57 = 𝑙𝑛 𝑦1 + 𝑙𝑛 𝐺28 +

226

𝑙𝑛 𝐺56 . By means of a variance decomposition of ln 𝑦57 in the variances and covariances of these three

227

terms, we can assess the contribution of each term to final size variation in the experiment (Rees et

228

al. 2010).

229

For individuals that were not measured on days 29 and 57 but just before or after (14/111 and 14/94,

230

respectively), we extrapolated their sizes to these days (one or two days away), using the relative

231

growth over the last interval in the period. Magnitudes of the three contributions to final size in the

232

experiment were compared with paired samples Wilcoxon tests (Wilcoxon 1945).

233

The log size variance on day 57 of the experiment depends on the variances of the three components

234

contributing and their covariances (Eqn. 3).

235
236

𝜎 2 𝑙𝑛 𝑦57 = 𝜎 2 𝑙𝑛 𝑦1 + 𝜎 2 𝑙𝑛 𝐺28 + 𝜎 2 𝑙𝑛 𝐺56 + 2𝜎𝑙𝑛 𝑦1 ,𝑙𝑛 𝐺28 + 2𝜎𝑙𝑛 𝑦1 ,𝑙𝑛 𝐺56 + 2𝜎𝑙𝑛 𝐺28,𝑙𝑛 𝐺56

237

(Eqn. 3)

238
239

This is the covariance of final size with itself, which is the sum of the covariance of final size with initial

240

size, the covariance of final size with log relative growth until day 29 (early growth), and with log

241

relative growth between days 28 and 57 (late growth). We can interpret absolute values of these three

242

quantities divided by their sum as relative importances (Rees et al. 2010).

243

We determined relative importances of the three components for the variance between individuals,

244

restricted to individuals that were not stunted and which provided values for all three terms. We

245

resampled the dataset 100 times to obtain standard deviations on the relative importances.

246

We also calculated relative importances for the variance in final size between species. To obtain

247

estimates of component variances and covariances, we fitted multivariate mixed models (Bates et al

248

2014) to the three log components of final size with random species effects, allowing random effect

249

covariances between the three component traits and including the fixed effects listed above with

250

component-specific values. In agreement with the analyses of initial size and relative growth rates, we

251

present results assuming random effects per trait which are independent between species. The

252

covariances between the final sizes per species and each size component were then calculated as

253

follows. Predicted values of the summed fixed and random effect part of the mixed model were

254

generated for all species (twelve) where predictions for all three components could be made, To

255

remove individual variation in the fixed effects, we assumed for the predicted values that fish were

256

hatched after four months in the egg, did not show stunted growth and were sexed as a male. The

257

species-specific areas of endemism and taxa with large species were kept as fixed effects. The

258

variances and covariances of the predicted species values were calculated and a parametric bootstrap

259

of the mixed model was used to obtain standard deviations on the relative importances. Magnitudes

260

of the three predicted species contributions to final size were compared with paired samples Wilcoxon

261

tests (Wilcoxon 1945).

262
263

Comparison with other toothcarps. We compare our results with growth data from other studies on

264

annual and non-annual killifish. We found group averages of size at age, from which we calculated

265

relative growth per day as above. We point out that such estimates based on averages can be biased

266

(Hoffmann and Poorter 2002). We did not observe large changes in variances between pairs of data

267

points from which we calculated growth, therefore we expect such bias to be limited. We retrieved

268

Results

275
276

We hatched 203 fish that could swim freely, of which 116 reached day 50 after hatching. The

277

principal component analysis on the coordinates of pond locations resulted in a first PC parallel with

278

the Atlantic coast in a North-South direction and a second PC orthogonal to that, which therefore

279

captures differences in the distance from the Atlantic Ocean.

Survival and stunting. When we plotted a log survivorship curve of all survival data, we noted that

282

the overall death rate is constant. We found no significant effects of age of the embryos on survival

283

probability until day 50. Species from the (A. robustus, A. vazferreirai) clade of large species have a

284

reduced survival probability ( = -2.06 (0.70), 2(1) = 10.50, p = 0.0012). At the same time, there is an

285

effect of the areas of endemism (2(2) = 9.81, p = 0.007). Species from the La Plata area of endemism

286

have a larger survival probability (estimate difference  = 1.37 (0.50), Patos  = 0.45 (0.45)). We

287

found a significant effect of area of endemism on the probability to become stunted (2(2) = 16.26, p

288

= 0.0002). There are no stunted individuals among species from the Negro area and about 20% in

289

species from the other two areas. Large species from the A. elongatus, A. prognathus, A.

290

cheradophilus group had an increased probability to become stunted ( = 1.57 (s.e. 0.43), 2(1) =

291

13.74, p = 0.0002). Smooth functions of spatial coordinate scores had no significant effects on

292

survival nor stunting.

293
294

Initial size. In GAMM models with all fixed and a random species effect, PC's of spatial coordinates

295

were best fitted with linear functions. We therefore fitted phylogenetic mixed models with such

296

linear functions to find that the phylogenetic random effect could be removed (LRT non-significant,

297

AIC smaller without phylogenetic covariances, Akaike 1974). From model selection of the fixed

298

effects, we found that the three taxa with large species systematically have larger hatchling sizes.

299

Embryos born from older eggs are larger (Table 1), demonstrating scope for cohort effects and

300

selection on size in the egg bank. Hatchlings of small species from the Patos area of endemism are

301

larger relative to the Negro area, and those from La Plata smaller. The first PC score, which increases

302

in a direction parallel to the Atlantic coast and to the North (called "North" from here on) does not

303

have a significant effect on hatchling size. The second PC increases towards the Atlantic Coast (Called

304

"Coast" from here on) and has a negative effect, hence hatchling size decreases for population

305

situated closer to the Atlantic Coast (Table 1).

306

Relative growth. Figure 2 shows growth curves for all individuals in the experiment, and fitted

307

smooth growth curve functions. The figure shows that relative to other studies and to field data,

308

individuals in our lab environment have similar or larger sizes for their ages. Moreover, in our

309

experiment fish seem slightly larger than in the field for their age. The growth data we collected is

310

therefore relevant. Moreover, individuals growing somewhat slower in our experiment are still

311

achieving sizes comparable to individuals in the field. Figure 3 shows the pattern of relative growth

312

across species. Most species initially increase in total length by about 5% per day and by the end of

313

the experiment, they still do so by about 2% per day on average. Fig. 3 shows that there is much

314

more individual variation around the species-specific averages for the first days after hatching. We

315

therefore analyzed daily relative growth until day 15 after hatching and after day 15 separately, thus

316

separating the dataset into two subsets with comparable numbers of intervals per individual.

317

Different factors affect species differences in different stages of growth (Table 1). Regarding growth

318

during the first fifteen days, a model with phylogenetic random effects did not outperform a model

319

with independent species effects (AIC -2495 vs. -2497, no difference in log-likelihood of the fitted

320

models). Table 1 thus presents a model with independent species effects. Species from the clade

321

containing Austrolebias elongatus grow more rapidly than the other species, about 1-2 % faster per

322

day. Individuals that could not be sexed by the end of the experiment were growing slower shortly

323

after hatching (Table 1). When splines of the PC's of spatial locations were fitted, these contributed

324

significantly in the complete model, but did not do so after model selection.

334

Relative growth later in the experiment is still above 3% per day but declines to below one percent

335

per day at the end of the experiment. Again, a model including phylogenetic next to independent

336

species effects was not preferred and Table 1 presents results from the model with independent

337

species effects only. Species from the Austrolebias elongatus clade grew slower, whereas A.

338

robustus and A. vazferreirai grew faster. Stunted individuals grow slower. Species from the La Plata

339

and Patos assemblages grow faster per day, with the largest effect for the La Plata species. When we

340

added spatial coordinates in a GAMM, linear functions of them performed best but these were not

341

retained after model selection. Note that we did not detect any significant sex-specific effects on

342

growth.

343

Contributions to final size variation. When we inspect the three log-transformed components of

344

final size (Figure 4), hatchling size clearly makes the largest contribution to final size in the

345

experiment. The contribution of initial size to log final size is significantly larger than that of early

346

growth. The early growth contributions are larger than late growth (both paired Wilcoxon tests p <

347

0.0001, Figure 4). Across individuals, initial size contributes 0.65 (s.d. 0.10) in relative importance of

348

the final size variance, early growth 0.35 (0.11) and growth after day 28 contributes 0.003 (0.060).

349

Initial size thus has a significantly larger relative importance than growth in the second month after

350

hatching. The last component has a small relative importance because the large negative covariance

351

between initial size and growth after two weeks cancels the variance of late growth. When we

352

compare species averages in the figure, it appears that initial size explains most of final size variation

353

among species, paired Wilcoxon tests comparing magnitudes are significant (p = 0.0005). There is

354

again a negative covariance between initial sizes of different species and late growth which is larger

355

than the variance between species in late growth. The relative contribution of initial size to final size

356

variance among species is 0.69 (0.07), of early cumulative growth it is 0.19 (0.09) and growth

357

towards the end of the experiment contributes 0.12 (0.08). The confidence intervals for relative

358

contributions among species do not overlap between initial size and early or late growth.

359

Comparison with Nothobranchius and non-annuals. When we plot relative growth for all individuals

360

in this dataset (Figure 5) and values from the literature from other related species we see that other

361

estimates for Austrolebias are similar to the values we collected. However, in this experiment,

362

individuals sustained levels of relative growth (2-3 %) for much longer. The data on non-annual

363

killifish suggests that these have smaller relative growth rates throughout. Nothobranchius fry

364

initially indeed grow explosively, but drop to relative growth rates below the ones in this experiment

365

after three weeks. We note that relative growth in the first weeks for Nothobranchius is within the

366

range of measurements we made. We can assume that extremely large relative growth rates in our

367

data are due to measurement error. Alternatively, the data could suggest that some individuals in

368

this experiment are not growing much slower than the average Nothobranchius.

369
370

Discussion

371
372

Hatchling size is the largest contributor to size variation between Austrolebias species and its relative

373

importance is significantly larger than that of early or late growth. It is not only determined by

374

species differences, but also by parental or environmental effects, since we found effects of storage

375

duration on hatchling size, of area of endemism and of the distance of the site of origin from the

376

Atlantic coast. Large species from two clades show different patterns of growth over the experiment

377

than smaller species. The A. elongatus clade grows faster than the other species in the first two

378

weeks after hatching, but then has a reduced relative growth rate comparable to the smaller

379

congenerics, which we suggest is potentially due to constraints from experimental conditions. The

380

robustus group grows faster than the other species from two weeks after hatching until the end of

381

the experiment. This indicates that different clades of large species may be reaching their mature

382

sizes using different growth strategies.

383
384

Adaptive initial size and growth patterns

385

Individual relative growth rates which are decreasing with age after hatching are adaptive when

386

mortality increases with individual relative growth rate, when mortality decreases with size (Sibly et

387

al 1985). Without environmental changes, catch-up growth is not adaptive (Sibly et al 1985). We

388

observed that the rate of death in our experiment is approximately constant, so at least in the

389

context of our experiment the first explanation does not hold overall. We find, within the

390

experiment, a reduced survival probability for the species of the A. robustus clade, and an elevated

391

probability of becoming stunted for the A. elongatus group of species. There is therefore no

392

evidence of decreased mortality rates with size, rather the opposite is suggested, but in field

393

conditions the pattern might occur nevertheless. Given that the fish in our experiment grew faster

394

than the available field data, a constraint might be present in the field and affect the adaptive

395

pattern of growth but we do observe some catch-up growth in the A. robustus clade of large species,

396

contradicting Sibly et al (1985). The adaptive explanations proposed by Sibly et al (1985) are

397

therefore not supported by the experiment and would depend on field conditions such as

398

competition.

399

We can also reject the main expectations of Sibly et al (2015): we did not find that all size variation

400

between species is due to changes in juvenile growth. Secondly, within species, there is substantial

401

remaining relative growth variation even when excluding stunted individuals. More specific for the

402

ecology of annual killifish, our results are in agreement with Eckerström-Liedholm et al (2017). We

403

found a large effect of hatchling size variation on final size and all large species have increased

404

hatchling sizes. However, we also found differences in growth among species which contribute to

405

size variation, most notably the increased early growth rate for the largest species. Our finding that

406

hatchling sizes are smaller closer to the Atlantic coast might indicate that individuals are less

407

constrained there by seasonal variation to achieve an adaptive adult size. I.e., near the coast, the
18

408

seasonality of rainfall might permit longer growth seasons. However, species from the Patos area of

409

endemism which is overall close to the coast initially have larger hatchling size, contradicting this at

410

the between-species level. In addition, we observe that species from the La Plata area of endemism

411

grow faster later after hatching as well as those from the Patos area, to a lesser extent. This might

412

again indicate that there is scope for growth during a longer period after hatching near the Atlantic

413

coast.

414

We also briefly discuss three additional hypotheses on growth variation. First, predation can select

415

for faster growth. However, we do not know which populations lack predation, except for the Negro

416

area where no piscivorous Austrolebias occurs. Second, Arendt (1997) stated that growth can be

417

limited because the rate at which morphological structures develop is limited. For example, muscle

418

structure differs in dependence on growth speed, and can become less efficient with faster growth.

419

The increased growth rate in the piscivorous species after hatching motivates a further investigation

420

to check if these species would sacrifice performance efficiency for size. Third, Dmitriew (2011)

421

explained such costs of growth acceleration in purely ecological terms. When energy allocation is

422

directed elsewhere for example to reduce the time to complete a stage in development, growth

423

must be reduced. It is unclear whether hatchlings of piscivorous species would need to achieve a

424

certain size as soon as possible to permit access to specific resources such as fish prey.

425
426

Comparative lab experiments versus data from the field

427

Comparative studies such as Eckerström-Liedholm et al (2017) use lab or field data, or both. Size

428

measures from field populations are widely available, but growth rates are often only available as

429

population averages, or rates calculated from size measurements on different groups of individuals

430

(e.g. Winemiller and Rose 1992). An advantage of field data is that it can be assumed that each

431

species has been sampled in an environment it is adapted to. On the other hand, intra- and

19

432

interspecific competition can affect different species to a different extent, modifying pairwise size

433

comparisons. We have collected lab data for a comparative analysis. With lab data obtained in one

434

or several controlled environments, it is likely that some species will be performing less than others

435

in the chosen environments. Hence, some species will show their overall maximum growth rates

436

while others may not. To understand the causation of size variation, field data don't seem a valid

437

substitute for controlled lab experiments, but they can be used to assess the pertinence of growth

438

patterns observed in the lab. If the purpose is to compare adaptive growth curves between species,

439

environments tuned to each species or field environments seem required.

440

Martins and Hansen (1996) pointed out that comparative methods often have the same weaknesses

441

as meta-analyses, and at the time, methods didn't permit incorporating individual variability easily.

442

In addition, Goolsby (2015) noted that field data might render inference unreliable when it assumes

443

the absence of phenotypic plasticity. With the advent of phylogenetic mixed models and the

444

realization that these models are similar to the animal model of quantitative genetics (Lynch 1991),

445

it has become easier to analyse lab data obtained in complex experimental designs and

446

environments. We propose to see our data as character states sampled on the species and

447

individual-specific reaction norms at a particular combination of environmental parameters.

448

Future studies could expand on the environmental treatments imposed and will permit to estimate

449

species variation for growth plasticity. We did not need the function-valued methods proposed by

450

Goolsby (2015) to reconstruct ancestral states and maybe infer selection regime shifts, as we had

451

already obtained hypotheses for shifts in traits for some taxa from other studies and could therefore

452

use these as starting points in this study.

453

A comparative analysis should not require very many species just to overcome limitations of

454

individual data points or limitations of the methods of analysis (Mitov et al 2018). The larger the

455

number of species in an analysis, the less likely that traits are directly comparable between all of

456

them. It therefore seems most obvious to extend the analysis we carried out to an experiment with

457

a similar set of species crossed over several lab environments, to obtain first estimates of species

458

variation in plasticity. However, in quantitative genetics, large and long-term datasets and improved

459

methods have permitted the study of natural selection and phenotypic plasticity in the wild

460

(Charmantier et al 2014). For comparative phylogenetic methods, mixed models applied to multi-

461

species field data might permit similar advances, but to limit the range of species for which detailed

462

data need to be available, and to limit the range of models to be fitted and compared these might

463

require a priori hypotheses to be tested instead of the automated model selection (e.g. Bastide et al.

464

2018) which is currently common and demands a large set of species to be included.

465
466

Non-annual and African annual killifish

467

When we compare relative growth rates at different days after hatching between this experiment

468

and other lab and field studies then it can be noted that early relative growth of Austrolebias is

469

faster than of non-annuals but slower than of N. furzeri in some experiments. Later on, after about a

470

month, the fish in this experiment outperformed nearly all other values we collected. This might be a

471

side effect of our experimental setup, where we avoided competition and degrading environments,

472

or it might be the case that Austrolebias sustain fast growth longer and thus achieve larger adult

473

sizes for the same initial size. The amounts of variability we observed between individuals suggest

474

that it might be possible to tweak environments to obtain relative growth rates closer to the ones

475

observed in Nothobranchius (Blažek et al 2013). Faster growth might require experimental

476

conditions with fluctuating temperatures (Boltana et al 2017) and there might be species differences

477

in the extent of this effect. Note that we did not tune the environment to specific species and

478

neither did we generate a sequence of environmental conditions to obtain the largest possible

479

growth rates at any age. We chose a standardized common environment where we expected all

480

species from the three areas of endemism to perform relatively well. The fact that we observed no

481

stunting among the species from the Negro area and a smaller survival probability for that area

482

seems to indicate that the environment we chose is not an environment these species are very well

483

adapted to because it led to the strongest expected survival effects on the fish. Species from the A.

484

robustus group have a reduced survival probability and a pattern of growth suggesting catch-up

485

growth. This might also be a side effect of the conditions we imposed, where a non-constant

486

environment might lead to overall faster growth and larger size.

487
488

Conclusion

489

Using growth curves of 18 Austrolebias species, we demonstrate that hatchling size variation is a

490

main determinant of adult size variation in annual killifish. In addition, we find an increased early

491

growth rate in the piscivorous species, augmenting their size. Environmental effects of spatial

492

location of the population of origin on hatchling size and growth suggest that the time constraint

493

which explains the importance of hatchling size variation for adult annual fish size might be

494

weakened in populations occurring near the Atlantic coast. This suggests that the manner in which

495

annual killifish defy the overall expectations on determinants of adult fish size, might be locally

496

adapted to environmental constraints.

If measurement error is the same for length measurements at different ages and equal to 𝜎 2 𝑦 , we

619

can calculate an approximation to the measurement error in the relative growth rate (Eqn. S1) using

620

a first-order Taylor expansion of total length y,

We included this error model in linear mixed models for relative growth rate variation. However,

624

there is no software available to combine such error models with phylogenetic mixed models. We

625

therefore fitted independent species effects (Pinheiro and Bates 2000). As an alternative to this

626

error model, we also allowed the residual variance to depend on the age of the individual. The

627

likelihoods of the data assuming either of these models were compared, also with the likelihood

628

obtained from the model assuming a homoscedastic residual variance. We found that the model

629

where the residual variance depended on individual age outperformed the other two models for

630

early relative growth. We report here the fixed effect tests of that model. For late relative growth,

631

homoscedastic errors were preferred, which is the model in the last column of Table 1.

Figure 1. Overview of size data on Austrolebias annual killifish from different studies. Per species,

639

silhouettes show the average contour shapes of the species in this experiment at hatching (black), at

640

day 28 (light grey) and at the end of the experiment (dark gray). Bars to the right of the contours

641

indicate standard length data from up to four datasets. Uppermost bar: the size PC used by Van

642

Dooren et al (2018), second bar: maximum sizes used in Helmstetter et al (2018). Third bar: lengths

643

from a lab experiment in Leiden in the Netherlands in 2008. Fourth bar: data collected in 2013 from

644

outdoor breeding stocks at the Foljuif field station foljuif.ens.fr and outdoor breeding in a private

645

garden in the Netherlands. An inset (B) shows the three areas of endemism species in this study

646

originate from. Locations where fish populations originate from are added as points. Inset photos:

Figure 2. Overview of growth curves of the different Austrolebias species in our dataset. Age is

650

expressed as number of days after hatching. Per species, the growth curve predicted by a smoothing

651

spline with a smoothness parameter shared by all species is added. Only the data on non-stunted

652

individuals were used to fit smoothing splines. For comparison, data points from other studies on

653

some of the species we measured are added and colour-coded as follows. Red: individual size-at-age

654

data in the natural environment. Austrolebias bellottii, A. nigripinnis and A. elongatus: individual

655

total lengths at age from the Garcia et al. 2017 field study. Blue: Average size at age. Austrolebias

656

viarius: total length lab data were taken from Errea and Danulat (2001), A. wolterstorffi standard

657

Figure 4. Contributions of log initial size, early and later growth to total size in Austrolebias.

664

Individual data points (small squares) are shown for log initial size (red), log cumulative growth from

665

day 1 to 29 (blue) and log cumulative growth from day 29 to 58 (black). Only individuals that were

666

not stunted and that survived until day 56 are included. Per species, average values are shown as

667

circles with the same colours per component as for the individual data. The three top circles are the

668

average components and total size at the end of the experiment for A. elongatus (average log of the

669

total length in mm, 4.16), the three bottom circles A. nigripinnis (average log total length 3.28).

Figure 5. Comparison of relative growth per day in Austrolebias with other studies on Austrolebias

672

(black points), Nothobranchius annuals (blue) and non-annuals (red). The individual field data added

673

in Fig. 2 is omitted here. Other studies did not provide individual values, therefore relative growth

674

was estimated from average sizes at age. Austrolebias data of this study are plotted per individual

675

(grey) and the smooth curves from Figure 3 per species are added (black). Squares: field data, circles:

676

lab data. The square at age zero is a relative growth rate estimate for Rivulus hartii obtained from

677

field data, but it was unclear at which age the estimate applied.
