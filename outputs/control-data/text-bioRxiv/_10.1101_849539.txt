Abstract

38

Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) is an emerging antibiotic resistant

39

pathogen. Strain-level investigations are beginning to reveal the molecular mechanisms used

40

by VREfm to colonize regions of the human bowel. However, the role of commensal bacteria

41

during VREfm colonization, in particular following antibiotic treatment, remains largely

42

unknown. We employed amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics in a murine

43

model system to try and investigate functional roles of the gut microbiome during VREfm

44

colonization. First-order taxonomic shifts in gut microbial community composition were

45

detected both in response to pretreatment using ceftriaxone, and to subsequent VREfm

46

challenge. Using neural networking approaches to find co-occurrence profiles of bacteria and

47

metabolites, we detected key metabolome features during and after VREfm colonization. These

48

metabolite features were associated with Bacteroides, indicative of a transition towards a pre-

49

antibiotic naïve microbiome. This study shows the impacts of antibiotics on the gut ecosystem,

50

and the progression of the microbiome in response to colonisation with VREfm. Our results

offer insights towards identifying potential non-antibiotic alternatives to eliminate VREfm

52

through metabolic re-engineering to preferentially select for Bacteroides.

Importance

55

This study demonstrates the importance and power of linking bacterial composition profiling

56

with metabolomics to find the interactions between commensal gut bacteria and a specific

57

pathogen. Knowledge from this research will inform gut microbiome engineering strategies,

58

with the aim of translating observations from animal models to human-relevant therapeutic

59

applications.

Introduction

63

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) is a significant healthcare-associated

64

pathogen. VREfm infections can be difficult to treat due to their intrinsic and acquired

65

resistance to nearly all classes of antibiotics (1). The World Health Organisation categorizes

66

VREfm as a “High Priority” bacterial pathogen, advocating research to stop the global increase

67

in antibiotic resistance (2). Recent studies highlight the importance of the gut microbiota in

68

modulating the growth and virulence of VREfm in the gastrointestinal ecosystem. For instance,

69

the depletion of normal gut flora using antibiotics exacerbates the severity of VREfm infection

70

(3), whereas transplant of commensal species including a consortium of Clostridium bolteae,

71

Blautia producta, Blautia sartorii, and Parabacteroides distasonis (4, 5) can drive established

72

VREfm colonisation to below levels of culture detection. Specifically, B. producta – a

73

colonizer of the colon – reduces VREfm growth in vivo by secreting a lantibiotic (6). These

74

observations raise the intriguing possibility that metabolic traits act in concert between

75

pathogen and select gut commensals to confer mutual benefits during pathogen persistence.

76

These findings also highlight the greater risk posed to immunocompromised patients when

77

colonized with VREfm. For instance, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation patients

78

have gastrointestinal tracts that are dominated by VREfm as a result of losing a large portion

79

of the intestinal commensal microbiota upon receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics as pre-

80

treatment(7). Hildebrand et al., (2018) discovered long-term ecological impacts to the gut

81

microbiome, with strong bacterial species turnover, after ceftriaxone treatment in humans (8).

82

Further, mice receiving broad spectrum antibiotics (combination of metronidazole, neomycin,

83

and vancomycin) showed markedly increased VREfm colonization of the caecum and colon.

84

The compromised intestinal innate immune defenses in these animals allowed proliferation of

85

VREfm caused by the antibiotic exposure and subsequently reduced the expression of

86

antimicrobial molecules produced by bacteria in the intestinal mucosa(9).

87

The problem with VREfm is further complicated by the fact that Enterococci are

88

members of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota; a key reservoir of antimicrobial resistance

89

(AMR) genes, and potentially facilitating gene transfer within the gut microbiome(10). For

90

example, the vanB resistance gene was detected in human faecal specimens that did not contain

91

culturable VRE; and instead, demonstrated that isolates carrying the resistance transposon are

92

anaerobic commensal bacteria, Eggerthella lenta and Clostridium innocuum(11). Colonisation

93

of, and persistence in, the gastrointestinal tract therefore presents as a key mechanism for de

94

novo VRE and may lead to severe invasive disease.

95
96

This current study aimed to understand the impact of antibiotics on the murine gut microbiota,

97

and the subsequent colonisation pattern of VREfm. To this extent, we designed a murine model

98

time-series study that consisted of two main perturbative phases: (1) antibiotic pre-treatment

99

with ceftriaxone, and (2) VREfm challenge. Our 16S rRNA profiling analyses highlighted a

100

first-order shift in bacterial biodiversity composition across time, a second-order clustering of

samples associated with the experimental phases, and the transition of the post-VREfm

102

colonisation gut microbiota and its metabolome towards resembling an asymptomatic carriage-

103

like microbiome phenotype. This research provides support for engineering the metabolic

104

potential of the gut microbiome using, for example, prebiotics as a non-antibiotic alternative

105

for treating multi-drug resistant bacterial infections.

Experimental design

109

The following experimental design was developed to address the hypothesis that there are

110

specific murine gut microbiome factors that facilitates VREfm colonization; three groups of

111

three C57BL/6 mice (co-caged wildtype males) were monitored, and fecal samples collected,

112

over a fourteen-day period with two intervention time-points; including (1) a two-day

113

ceftriaxone treatment administered at 0.5g/L in drinking water, and (2) colonisation (via oral-

114

gavage) with 1 x 106 VREfm ST796 per mice post-antibiotic treatment. Mice were housed in

115

groups of three to represent three technical replicates per cage; herein, each group of three co-

116

housed mice will be referred to as Group A, Group B, and Group C. Table 1 highlights samples

117

and datasets collected.

Amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed first order shifts in bacterial community

121

Amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to capture the bacterial community

122

composition in an effort to track changes in response to antibiotic pre-treatment and VREfm

123

colonization. Bacterial community profiles were assessed in fecal samples from nine mice

124

before, during and after the two interventions (Table 1). A total of 71.32% of reads (10,519,073

125

reads) passed quality control, with 321,955 reads on average per sample and a total of 3574

126

exact variant sequence types (i.e., features), with an average of 118 features per sample, and

127

an upper bound of 246 features (when rarefied to 20,000 reads). Alpha rarefaction analysis

128

demonstrated sufficient sequencing depth to capture microbial diversity to saturation

129

(Supplementary Figure 1).

130

The biodiversity profiles of each sample were compared and showed that key sOTUs

131

were differentially abundant throughout the course of the experiment. Of note, there was a shift

132

in the dominance of Bacteroidia (Bacteroidetes; light green coloured bars) during the naïve

133

phase of the experiment to Mollicutes (Tenericutes; pink coloured bars) in response to

134

ceftriaxone treatment, with a return to the predominance of Bacteroidia during the late-phase

135

of the experiment, post-VREfm colonisation (i.e., days 12 – 14).

136
137

The murine gut microbiota responds to antibiotics and microbial community richness begins

138

to rebound three-days post-VRE colonisation

139

Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of the unweighted UniFrac(12) distances was used to

140

assess clustering of fecal samples based on bacterial composition. This assessment showed that

141

the fecal microbiota from samples collected from each phase clustered together but were

142

clearly separated between phases; after exposure to ceftriaxone, and challenge with VREfm

143

post-antibiotic treatment (Figure 2A). Permutation-based statistical testing demonstrates the

144

groups are significantly different from one another (Supplementary Figure 2). Temporal

145

tracking of the changing microbiomes against each mouse on the PCoA sample-space

146

demonstrated a clear, unidirectional trajectory that followed the chronology of the experiment

147

(animation as a supplementary file). Procrustes analyses of weighted and unweighted UniFrac

148

distances showed that the same general patterns on the sample space were preserved, meaning

149

that there is congruency in global spatial patterns between qualitative and quantitative measures

150

of community dissimilarity (Supplementary Figure 3).

151

Analysis of community diversity (Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity Index) revealed a

152

stable and rich microbial community during the naïve phase preceding a sharp decrease

153

following antibiotic treatment, and a further decrease immediately following VREfm

154

colonisation (Figure 2B). Of note is the responsiveness of the microbiota (within 24 hours) to

155

the removal of antibiotics at the end of day 7. Community richness began to rebound at

156

approximately three-days post-VREfm colonisation (i.e., day 12), with Group A demonstrating

157

a faster rate of rebound compared to Group B and C. Calculating the distances of dissimilarity

158

(unweighted UniFrac distances) of each mouse microbiota timepoint relative to Day 0 (a proxy

159

for the naive bacterial community phenotype) revealed a small dissimilarity distance for

160

samples collected during the naïve phase, and an increasing dissimilarity distance following

161

antibiotic treatment (day 6) and VREfm colonisation (day 9; Figure 2C). There was a

162

downward trajectory in distance scores at three-days post-VREfm colonisation (i.e., day 12);

163

Group A followed a sharper return to a microbiota resembling day 0. These observations

164

suggest that mice were transitioning towards a persistent carrier-like state, and that the

165

rebounding community richness towards levels representative of the naïve phase was by a

166

microbial community structure that resembled the naïve phase. Additional studies, where the

167

time-frame post-VREfm challenge extends beyond one-week of monitoring, are needed.

169

Multinomial regression identifies sOTUs most positively associated with VREfm colonisation

170

Multinomial regression using Songbird was employed to identify sOTUs that were most

171

positively, and negatively, associated with the post-VREfm colonisation phase (Figure 3). The

172

five most positively associated sOTUs were Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Erysipelotrichaceae,

173

Catabacter, and Lachnospiraceae; while the five most negatively associated were

174

Clostridiales, Adlercreutzia, Mollicutes, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Clostridiales. Temporal

175

tracking of exact sequence variants (ESV) demonstrated that the ESV feature classified as

176

Enterococcus - and identified as the most positively associated with the post-VREfm

177

colonisation phase - was most abundant on days of challenge; confirming that this ESV likely

178

was the ST796 VREfm colonization challenge organisms. There were a further eight ESV

179

features classified as Enterococcus, however, they were absent during the days representing

180

VREfm colonisation, and lacked positive associations with the post-VREfm colonisation

181

phase, suggesting that these features represent murine gut commensal Enterococci.

182
183

Molecular networking identifies differential metabolome profiles

184

Duplicate fecal samples from key timepoints throughout the experiment (i.e., days 0, 5, 6, 7, 8,

185

9, and 14) were analysed by data dependent tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS) performed on

186

a liquid-chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight (LC-QTOF) to monitor changes in the

187

murine gut metabolome (Table 1). Mass spectrometry in both positive and negative polarity

188

identified 627 spectra with library hits through the Global Natural Products Social Molecular

189

Networking (GNPS;(13)). Analysis of the global metabolome profile of each sample was

190

measured based on their overlapping molecules, and a PCoA plot using a binary Jaccard

191

distance metric; a qualitative measure of sample dissimilarity. A separation of metabolite

192

profiles along PCoA1 was observed (57.34% Figure 4A). Metabolomes from the naïve, and

193

late-VREfm colonisation phase tended to cluster together, while samples from the post-

194

antibiotic phases including the early-VREfm colonisation phase clustered together

195

(Supplementary Figure 4 with supporting pairwise PERMANOVA testing).

196

Random forest analysis of spectra profiles from LC-MSMS was used to predict

197

experimental phase and rank the importance of metabolite association with each experimental

198

phase. The top metabolite features for each experimental phase are highlighted in Figure 4B.

199

Unique profiles of metabolite features were observed for each phase of the experiment.

200

Importantly, the late-VREfm colonisation phase captures an unknown metabolite with a mass-

201

to-charge ratio (m/z) of 173.067 and retention time (RT) of 18.392; this metabolite is

202

exclusively present during what represents the transition towards resembling the naïve

203

microbiome.

204
205

Bacteroidales-associated metabolites implicated in late-phase post-VREfm colonisation

206

A distinct profile shift in microbe and metabolite abundances (as calculated by multinomial

207

regression) was observed, particularly during late-phase VREfm colonisation (Supplementary

208

Figure 5). Shallow neural networking analysis with mmvec was used to predict microbe-

209

metabolite interactions through their co-occurrence probabilities (Figure 5). Sequential biplots

210

captured the shift in experimental phases and highlighted the co-occurrences of microbiota and

211

metabolomic datasets (Fig. 5A,B). There was a strong Enterococcus effect as indicated by the

212

magnitude of the corresponding arrow, and the rebounding species during the late-phase

213

VREfm colonisation are predominantly Bacteroidales sOTUs (Figure 5C); with the co-

214

occurring metabolite features m/z 173.067 RT 18.392, and m/z 167.083 RT 25.277. Metabolite

215

feature mz 245.055 RT 7.945 was ranked as being highly associated with the post-VRE

216

colonisation phase. These results integrate microbial and metabolite datasets to suggest which

217

microbes may be responsible for a particular metabolite. In this instance, the metabolite

218

exclusively present during what a transition towards the original naïve microbiome resembles

219

(m/z 173.067 and RT 18.392; Figure 5B) is linked with Bacteroidales.

Discussion

222

In this study of the murine gut ecosystem, we employed a mouse model of gastrointestinal tract

223

colonisation that replicates the shift in bacterial composition when patients enter the healthcare

224

system, develop an imbalance in microbiome as a result of pre-treatment (e.g., antibiotic

225

treatment), and are subsequently colonised with a hospital superbug (14). The resolution of

226

current studies describes a consortium of commensal microbes that can, for example, reduce

227

the magnitude of VREfm colonisation (4, 6); however, understanding the key metabolic shifts

228

relative to the gut microbiota remains challenging (15). Here, we employed amplicon 16S

229

rRNA gene sequencing and high-resolution mass spectrometry metabolomics in an effort

230

towards determining microbiota-metabolome interactions during VREfm colonisation. We

231

demonstrated clear changes in the gut microbiome in response to ceftriaxone and VREfm

232

challenge.

233
234

Conceptual and statistical advances in analysis of amplicon 16S rRNA gene data (16, 17)

235

whereby OTUs are clustered at a 99% nucleotide similarity threshold allows for the

236

identification of exact sequence variants (ESV). Query against an error-corrected database

237

(17)can detect multiple ESVs that may be classified to the same taxonomic rank. For example,

238

our analyses identified multiple ESVs classified as Enterococci; however, when the relative

239

abundances were tracked across the chronology of the experiment, only one Enterococci-ESV

240

was dominant in relative abundances and most positively associated with the days of post-

241

VREfm challenge. This highlights the resolving power to differentiate between commensal and

242

pathogenic strains of Enterococci when the composition of the microbial community is

243

considered. The fact that this was achievable at the level of amplicon 16S rRNA gene

244

sequencing alludes to the possibility of implementing microbiota screenings as routine

245

diagnostics for patients entering healthcare systems. Further, first-order level shifts in

246

microbial community composition was observed in response to ceftriaxone and subsequent

247

VREfm challenge (Figure 1). At three days post-VREfm colonisation (i.e., day 12), the

248

microbiome richness begins to rebound; suggesting that mice are transitioning towards a

249

persistent carrier-like state. Interestingly, Group A cohort exhibited a faster rate of rebound

250

that may be facilitated by their initially higher microbial community richness (Figure 2B); this

251

observation supports the need to prescreen “baseline” microbiota profiles of patients upon

252

admission into hospitals. We can begin to assess patients from across different wards (e.g.,

253

intensive care unit, oncology, neurology, and healthy cohorts), and build a database of

254

microbiome profiles that can be used as biomarkers to predict: (1) the susceptibility of patients

255

to develop persistent bacterial colonisation, and (2) propensity to clear the pathogen once

256

colonized. The clinical implication is that new patients are screened and identified (via beta-

257

diversity meta-analyses) by these biomarkers and placed in bedding cohorts accordingly;

258

thereby improving infectious disease management and isolation precautions within health-care

259

associated ecosystems.

260
261

The shortlist of microbes ranked as most negatively associated with the colonisation phase

262

(Clostridiales, Adlercreutzia, Mollicutes, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Clostridiales) are

263

hypothesized to play a role in maintaining the health of the animals. Indeed, amongst the

264

microbes identified, are known short chain fatty acid (e.g., butyric acid) producers (18, 19) that

265

supports, and expands upon those previously identified by Caballero et al., (2017). Further, the

266

use of Deblur to identify ESVs facilitates the temporal tracking of their relative abundances to

267

inform selection of primary fecal samples that will provide the best probability (i.e., highest

268

relative abundance) of culturing target taxa for downstream screening of probiotic potential.

269

However, translating animal-derived observations from experimental animal models to human

270

clinical situations remains challenging; particularly where the key microbes are rodent-

271

specific. One solution may be to integrate metabolomics to reveal shared metabolic capacity

272

amongst taxonomically divergent microbes. Our supervised classifying approaches suggests

273

an altered metabolome composition during the late-phase of VREfm challenge that may

274

facilitate the apparent “suppression” of VREfm to levels below the limit-of-detection by

275

culture. Despite the caveat of poor resolution in current databases to link metabolite features

276

to associated chemical structures, microbe-metabolite vector analysis linked one metabolite to

277

Bacteroides (m/z 173.067); permitting strain-level omics in an effort to comprehensively

278

annotate the metabolome. Further research to comprehensively characterize interactions

279

between microbe and metabolome will be critical to address the gaps in our understanding of

280

the biochemical parameters of the microbiome.

281
282

The resolution of our results provides the basis in which to begin to identify non-antibiotic

283

alternatives to engineer the gut microbiome and translating animal studies to human-relevant

284

therapeutic applications. Here, achieving integrative omics to link microbe-metabolite

285

associations, adds support to the incorporation of this approach to microbiome profiling into

286

routine clinical microbiology, particularly in the context of monitoring the impacts of antibiotic

287

use.

Amplicon 16S rRNA gene profiling analyses

311

Sequence data were processed within the QIITA framework for quality control (split libraries),

312

demultiplexing, trimming sequence reads to a length of 150 nt, and picking sub-operational

313

taxonomic units (sOTUs) using Deblur to resolve single-nucleotide community sequencing

314

patterns (i.e. feature identification of sOTUs;(17)). The output BIOM files were further

315

processed using QIIME2 for downstream statistical analyses(22). Alpha rarefaction curves

316

were generated to determine if each sample had been sequenced to saturation; the feature table

317

was subsequently rarefied to 20,000 reads per sample. Taxonomy was assigned using the

318

sklearn classifier (23) and Greengenes 13.8 99% OTUs from 515F/806R region of sequences

319

classifier available from https://docs.qiime2.org/2018.4/data-resources/. Furthermore, relative

320

abundances of each taxa were visualized as bar plots using the QIIME2 taxa plugin. A

321

phylogenetic tree was constructed using fragment-insertion (QIIME fragment-insertion sepp;

322

(24)) to guide phylogenetic-aware statistical analyses generated using the QIIME2 plugin, q2-

323

diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic; key metrics computed by default include both alpha-

324

diversity (e.g., Shannon’s diversity index, Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, and Evenness), and

325

beta-diversity (e.g., Bray-Curtis distance, and unweighted UniFrac distances) metrics. The

326

unweighted UniFrac distance matrix (12) was used to compute first distances and calculate

327

distances relative to Day 0 as baseline between sequential states (QIIIME longitudinal first-

328

distances); ggplot2 (R, https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) was used to visualize the distance scores

329

as line plots. Emperor was used to visualize principal coordinate analysis plots of unweighted

330

UniFrac distances. Permutation-based statistical testing (PERMANOVA) on unweighted

331

UniFrac distances was used to determine if samples grouped by phase of experiment were

332

significantly

333

(https://github.com/mortonjt/songbird) was employed to determine the importance (i.e., fold

334

change) of each sOTU in relation to a given metadata variable (e.g., VREfm-colonisation).

335

Microbial features from all samples were split into training and test sets for supervised learning

336

classifier analyses; 20% of input samples were allocated to train the Random Forest Classifier

337

within QIIME2, the estimator method used for sample prediction. The different experimental

338

phases were the response variables, while the 16S rRNA gene data (and metabolomic spectra)

were the features.

Metabolite extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry analysis

342

Duplicate fecal samples, as outlined in Table 1, were processed for polar metabolite extraction

343

and analysis (days 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 14). Feces were metabolically arrested by immediate

344

collection into dry ice, and stored at -80°C until further processing. Metabolite extraction from

345

the fecal samples was undertaken by the addition of 500 µL per sample of methanol:water

346

solution (3:1 v/v) containing 2µM 13C-sorbitol and 8µM 13C,15N-valine, and 2µM 13C-leucine

347

as internal standards. Fecal samples were homogenized at 1200 rpm for 30 minutes in a

348

thermomixer maintained at 4°C, and mechanically disrupted and incubated for a further 15

349

minutes in the thermomixer. Samples were randomized for metabolite extraction.

350

Metabolite analysis of the extracted samples and 13 mixtures of authentic standards

351

mixes was performed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), using

352

hydrophilic interaction column (ZIC-pHILIC) and high-resolution Agilent 6545 series

353

quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF MS) as described previously (25). Ions

354

were analyzed in positive mode with full scan range of 85 to 1200 m/z and in data-dependent

355

tandem MS mode to facilitate downstream metabolite identification. Mass spectrometry data

356

were deposited into QIITA (21) under the project title Mouse-hospital VRE colonization with

357

ceftriaxone treatment (Study ID 11737).

358
359

Metabolomic analyses

360

The data-dependent tandem MS data was processed using MZmine2 (26) to generate tabular

361

matrices of metabolite features. Metabolomic features were further analysed within the Global

362

Natural Products Social Networking (GNPS; (13)) framework (UCSD, CA, USA). Tandem

363

MS data were processed for identification, dereplication and quantification, including spectral

364

library searches. For example, MS2 spectra of the unknown metabolites are compared with a

365

library of MSMS spectra generated from structurally characterized metabolites. Further

366

information on the GNPS workflow, and molecular networking can be found in Ming et al.,

367

2016 (13).

First-order shifts in microbial community composition, as revealed by 16S rRNA community

588

profiling, from a predominance of Bacteroidetes to Tenericutes and return to Bacteroidetes was

589

observed. Each column displays the relative bacterial community composition in a mouse

590

faecal sample collected at daily intervals, and sorted by the chronology of the experiment (i.e.,

591

Day of experiment; Table 1). ‘M-A1’ notation refers to the box and mouse number; for

592

example, M-A1 is mouse 1 in Group A, while M-B2 is mouse 2 in Group B. The colors

593

represent different bacterial classes, including Bacteroidia (green), Clostridia (grey)

594

Tenericutes (Mollicutes; pink), Bacilli (brown), and gamma-Proteobacteria (yellow).

Figure 5 Microbe-metabolite vector biplots. Sequential biplots highlighting the changing

630

metabolite differentials across each key phase of the experiment; where abx tx corresponds to

631

the antibiotic treatment phase, and abx wean corresponds to the period where antibiotics were

632

removed for a 24-hour period prior to colonisation with VREfm. Each point on the sample

633

space represents metabolites, and arrows represent microbes. Microbe and metabolite features

634

are fixed upon the sample space, with gradient coloring of metabolites indicating the transition

635

across key phases of the experiment. The distance between each point is indicative of

636

metabolite co-occurrence frequency, and the angle between arrows indicate microbial co-

637

occurrence. The directionality of the arrows describes the variation in the metabolites explained

638

the microbes represented by the arrows. For example, metabolite mz 173.067 RT 18.392 is

639

demonstrated to co-occur with Bacteroides.
