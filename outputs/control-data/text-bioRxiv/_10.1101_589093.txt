Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of excess mortality in schizophrenia. Preclinical evidence shows

antipsychotics can cause myocardial fibrosis and myocardial inflammation in murine models, but it is not

known if this is the case in patients. We therefore set out to determine if there is evidence of cardiac fibrosis

and/or inflammation using cardiac MRI in medicated patients with schizophrenia compared with matched

healthy controls. 31 participants (14 patients and 17 controls) underwent cardiac MRI assessing myocardial

markers of fibrosis/inflammation, indexed by native myocardial T1 time, and cardiac structure (left ventricular

(LV) mass) and function (left/right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, stroke volumes, and

ejection fractions). Participants were physically fit, and matched for age, gender, smoking, blood pressure,

BMI, HbA1c, ethnicity, and physical activity. Compared with controls, native myocardial T1 was significantly

longer in patients with schizophrenia (effect size, d=0.89; p=0.02). Patients had significantly lower LV mass,

and lower left/right ventricular end-diastolic and stroke volumes (effect sizes, d=0.86-1.08; all p-values <0.05).

There were no significant differences in left/right end-systolic volumes and ejection fractions between groups

(p>0.05). These results suggest an early diffuse fibro-inflammatory myocardial process in patients that is

Methods
Subjects
A total of 17 patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) were recruited from community mental health services from

the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. A total of 17 healthy volunteers (HV) were

also recruited.

We recruited HV matched 1:1 to SCZ for age (+/- 3 years), ethnicity (1:1 matching of people of

2

Caucasian and non-Caucasian ethnicity), gender (1:1 matching of male and female), and BMI (+/- 2 kg/m

each other). Inclusion criteria for SCZ were:

of

an ICD-10/DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, and no history or

family history of other psychiatric disorders. Exclusion criteria for all participants were: age <18 or >65 years,

pregnancy or breastfeeding, a past medical history of, or current/past treatment for, any physical health

condition that might impact cardiac function (e.g. diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension (see

discarded and the second 2 values averaged. Physical activity grading was based on the Copenhagen City Heart
Study Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (eAppendix 1). Categories of activity were based on
participants’ level of activity over the preceding 12 months, ranging from level 1 (almost entirely sedentary) to
level 4 (>5 hours of exercise per week). Plasma HbA1c was analysed using the Tosoh G8 HPLC Analyzer (Tosoh
Bioscience, San Francisco). Chlorpromazine equivalent doses and dose-years were calculated as described by
Andreasen and colleagues (eAppendix 1).

Cardiac MRI Protocol
For all participants, CMR imaging was performed on a 3T Magnetom Prisma (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen,
Germany) using a combination of an 18-element body matrix coil and 12 elements of the 32-element spine
coil. Myocardial tissue alterations were assessed in line with consensus guidelines (eTable 1 and eAppendix 2)
by measuring the longitudinal relaxation time constant of the myocardium (native myocardial T1 time) using a
Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery (MOLLI) sequence, 5s(3s)3s variant in a mid-ventricular short axis
slice during breath-hold in end-expiration. The following imaging parameters were used for this
electrocardiogram gated single-shot balance steady state free precession sequence: slice thickness 8mm; flip
angle 35°; echo time 1.12ms; repetition time 280.56ms; matrix 144x256; pixel size 1.4 x 1.4mm; minimum TI
100ms; TI increment 80ms; acquisition window 167ms; GRAPPA 2 parallel imaging acceleration factor. Circle
Cardiovascular Imaging (CVI), Calgary, Canada, version 5.6.3 T1 mapping software was utilised with a Siemens
recommended correction factor of 1.035 applied. Each slice was divided into 6 segments as per the American
Heart Association model (figure 1 and eAppendix 2). An epicardial and endocardial erosion offset of 10% was
applied to the contours to ensure only myocardium was included. After visual inspection of all segments and
exclusion of those segments with evidence of artefact (e.g. owing to unintended motion effects), a mean T1
relaxation time for the remaining segments of each slice was calculated.

A standard clinical protocol for assessing biventricular function and volumes was followed according to
published international guidelines (eTable 1 and eAppendix 2) and blind to diagnostic group. Volumetric
analysis of the cine images was performed using CMRtools (Cardiovascular Imaging Solutions, London, UK)
with measurements obtained from the short-axis stack (figure 2A) using valve tracking on two corresponding
long-axis cines (figures 2B-E). Papillary muscle and trabeculations were included in the mass measurement,

using a semi-automated signal intensity-based thresholding technique. End-systolic and end-diastolic volumes
were calculated thus: as appropriate, in systole or diastole, areas within manually traced endocardial borders
(figure 2A) were calculated for each short axis cine, and multiplied by slice thickness to provide a slice volume.
Slice volumes are measured along the ventricle from apex to the level of the mitral valve (figures 2B-E) and
summed to calculate overall ventricular volume. Stroke volume and ejection fractions are calculated indirectly
from end diastolic and end systolic volumes. Ventricular mass is quantified by measuring the area between
endocardial and epicardial borders for sequential short axis cines (figure 2A), multiplying by the slice thickness
and summing the volume of each slice. Total myocardial volume is multiplied by myocardial density (1.05g/ml)
to provide a measure of myocardial mass. Volumes and mass were indexed to body surface area calculated
using the Mosteller formula. Indexed volumetric data were: left ventricular (LV) mass; LV and right ventricular
(RV) end-diastolic volumes; LV and RV end-systolic volumes; and LV and RV stroke volumes.

Statistical analysis
The Shapiro-Wilk test of normality was used to assess continuous variables. Depending on the data being
normally distributed, SCZ and HV groups were compared using either unpaired t-tests or Mann Whitney U
tests, as appropriate. For nominal variables, Fisher’s exact test was used to compare groups. After recruitment
was completed, we assessed for statistical matching of main factors recognized to be independently associated
with cardiac dysfunction, including age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status, blood pressure, HbA1c, BMI and
physical activity (see eAppendix 1 for more detailed description of physiological and environmental variables
associated with cardiac dysfunction).
The primary outcome assessed was native myocardial T1 time. In addition, we conducted secondary analyses
assessing cardiac structure (left ventricular mass) and function (left and right ventricular end-diastolic volumes,
end-systolic volumes, stroke volumes, and ejection fractions). As these were exploratory, correction for
multiple comparisons was not applied. Statistical analyses were performed on volumes and masses indexed to
body surface area. Physiological variables were not included as covariates in statistical analysis of cardiac
parameters owing to baseline statistical matching of these factors. Where we observed significant alterations
in cardiac parameters between patients and controls, for normally distributed variables, the corresponding
effect size (Cohen’s d) was calculated as the difference in mean cardiac MRI outcome between patients and

controls divided by the pooled standard deviation. In line with international guidelines,24 we did not compare
mean native T1 values with published normal ranges, as these outcomes are recognised to be scanner-specific.
Some patients were taking aripiprazole, which is a partial dopamine D2/3 agonist, in contrast to the other
antipsychotics, which are all D2/3 antagonists.25 In case the inclusion of patients taking partial agonists biased
the results, we conducted sensitivity analyses after excluding the subjects taking aripiprazole.
To further examine the putative link between antipsychotic use and myocardial fibrosis/inflammation,
Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to examine for an association between chlorpromazine
equivalent dose/chlorpromazine dose years and native myocardial T1 time in patients. Moreover, because
diabetes mellitus and hypertension are associated with development of myocardial fibrosis (eAppendix 1), we
also set out to examine if these parameters were associated with alterations in native myocardial T1 time in
patients. Spearman correlation coefficients were employed owing to the measure being robust to the
influence of outliers. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 25.0, Chicago, Illinois),
for which statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.

Results

3 of the 17 SCZ participants dropped out of the study prior to scanning. Thus, 14 patients (mean age = 39.9
years; SD = 13.1 years) and 17 controls (mean age = 37.9 years; SD = 12.2 years) were included in final
analyses. Further subject characteristics are described in table 1. SCZ and HV showed no significant differences
in age, gender, smoking status, blood pressure, BMI, HbA1c, ethnicity, and physical activity measures (all p >
0.05). No participant met World Health Organisation criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus or hypertension. For
patients, duration of contact with mental health services ranged from 0.5-15 years. At the time of assessment,
3 patients were receiving aripiprazole, 3 olanzapine, and 8 clozapine (table 1 describes chlorpromazine
equivalent doses and dose years). 6 of 31 participants (2 patients, 4 healthy volunteers) demonstrated
evidence of artefact on 1 of the 6 segments making up the mid-ventricular slice for purpose of T1 mapping
(figure 1). These segments were removed and native myocardial T1 calculated. Thus, 97% of ventricular

segments were included in analyses. Continuous cardiac monitoring demonstrated that all participants were in
sinus rhythm throughout the scans.
As shown in figure 3 and eTable 1, native myocardial T1 time was significantly longer in SCZ than HV with a
large effect size (1212.38 ±21.23 ms vs 1190.96 ±26.01 ms, p = 0.02; Cohen’s d effect size = 0.89). Moreover,
compared with HV, SCZ patients presented with lower indexed LV mass (d=0.76; p<0.05), smaller indexed LV
end-diastolic volume (d=0.92; p=0.02), smaller indexed LV stroke volume (d=1.11; p=0.01), smaller indexed RV
end-diastolic volume (p=0.02), and smaller indexed RV stroke volume (d=1.00; p=0.01). The difference was not
significant in SCZ compared with HV for the following parameters: LV and RV ejection fraction, and indexed LV
and RV end-systolic volume (all p > 0.05, eTable 2). Representative maps demonstrating differences between
patients and controls for native myocardial T1 times are shown in figure 4.
Variation in T1 values between mid-myocardial segments and removal of 3% of ventricular segments (owing to
identification of artefact) may have resulted in error in calculation of mean T1 time for some participants.
However, re-inclusion of these 6 segments in the analysis did not significantly alter results, with T1 relaxation
time remaining significantly longer in SCZ compared with HV (p = 0.02).
Removal of subjects taking aripiprazole (eTable 2) did not change results, except for indexed LV mass where
the difference between patients and controls was no longer significant (p=0.12). No significant association was
observed between T1 relaxation time and the following 4 variables: antipsychotic dose (Spearman r = 0.02; p =
0.94); duration of treatment (Spearman r = 0.10; p = 0.77), mean arterial pressure (Spearman r = 0.06; p =
0.86), and HbA1c (Spearman r = -0.19; p = 0.63).
Discussion

We observed that, compared with matched controls, native myocardial T1 was longer in antipsychotic-treated
individuals with schizophrenia, who also exhibited lower indexed ventricular mass and smaller indexed
ventricular and stroke volumes, with large effect sizes (d = 0.76-1.11). Subjects were matched for age, gender,
ethnicity and BMI, and there were no statistical differences between the groups in terms of smoking status,
blood pressure, HbA1c, and physical activity, indicating that our findings are unlikely to be explained by these
cardiac risk factors.

Two of these

using transthoracic echocardiography to quantify cardiac structure and function, have

demonstrated LV hypertrophy and reduced LV ejection fraction in patients, while we observed reductions in LV
mass in patients, and no difference between groups with regards right/left ejection fraction. An explanation
for these contrasting outcomes may relate to the sample characteristics of the patients included in analyses.
Previous studies have either failed to match patients and healthy volunteers uniformly for demographics or
cardiovascular risk factors,

18

or where matching for these parameters was achieved, confirmation of

absence a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in patients and controls was not confirmed with blood tests during the
study.15 This is a limitation, owing to under-reporting of physical co-morbidities in schizophrenia.26 Moreover,
these studies also failed to report the ethnicity of participants, which is of importance owing to the differential
risk of metabolic disease and LV hypertrophy across ethnic groups (e.g. LV hypertrophy is more prevalent in
individuals of black ethnicity).27 Echocardiographic evidence of cardiac disease in the context of metabolic
syndrome and smoking (leading to ischaemic heart disease) is characterised by LV hypertrophy and potentially
reduced ejection fraction.28 Thus, it is little surprise that these studies exhibited outcomes characteristic of a
group with increased cardiovascular risk. However, in the current study, we matched patients and healthy
volunteers for multiple cardiovascular risk factors and ethnicity, and in this context, absence of LV hypertrophy
and EF reductions suggests that previously observed cardiac alterations in schizophrenia were likely the
product of increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the patient group, alongside the added
potential confound of different ethnic makeup of the two groups. The current study is also the first to observe
reductions in end diastolic and stroke volumes in patients with schizophrenia compared with controls. Beyond
the limitations of previous studies in matching patients with healthy volunteer groups, this could relate to
differences in the method of assessing cardiac volumes, with MRI recognised as the more accurate measure
compared with echocardiography.19-22

Strengths and limitations
A strength of this study is the use of cardiac MRI to visualise the myocardium, which provides volumetric and
functional cardiac measures that are not possible to derive from alternative cardiac imaging techniques,
including assessments of myocardial tissue behaviour.19 Moreover, CMR is the gold standard for LV function
and mass quantification,20 and has been demonstrated to provide better test-retest reliability than

echocardiography,21 as well as lower inter- and intra-operator variability for a range of key measures.22 Thus,
this study is the first to use the gold standard approach to measure cardiac function in schizophrenia research
to date. A further strength is the matching of patients and controls for cardiac risk factors, thereby limiting the
influence of confounders on outcome variables. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude residual confounding due to
subtle sub-clinical metabolic or other variation.29-31 Moreover, it is recognised that measurement of certain
variables (e.g. exercise) were based on self-reporting. The Copenhagen Physical Activity Score is not specifically
designed for psychiatric populations, and individuals with schizophrenia can over-estimate the amount of
physical activity in which they engage.32 This may have contributed to our finding of no significant difference in
patients compared with controls with regards physical activity scores. However, a priori matching of groups in
terms of BMI and exclusion of patients with cardiovascular comorbidity may by association have resulted in
our observation of similar activity levels in the 2 groups. Future studies may consider including actigraphy to
objectively quantify physical activity levels. Finally, although we measured BMI, we did not assess
diet/abdominal obesity. However, metabolic alterations seen in schizophrenia or simply associated with poor
diet, reduced exercise, and smoking would be expected to result in cardiac dysfunction typical of metabolic
disease (such as LV hypertrophy28), the opposite to the pattern observed in this study. Indeed, although not
statistically significant, in absolute terms BMI was raised in SCZ compared with HV (p = 0.31). However,
increased BMI is associated with LV dilatation,33 while we observed the opposite in SCZ relative to HV. This
suggests that residual confounding due to metabolic alterations or inaccurate reporting of lifestyle factors was
not sufficient to alter outcomes, and indeed may have reduced the effect size magnitude of some parameters
observed. Similarly, although patients and healthy volunteers were statistically matched for proportion of
males and females (p = 0.50), there was still a relative increase in the proportion of females in the healthy
volunteer group compared with patient group. Some,34 although not all,35 studies have observed prolonged
native T1 in females compared with males. Moreover, smaller LV mass and ventricular volumes are observed
in females compared with males.34 However, with a greater proportion of females in the HV group, one would
expect this to result in relatively prolonged native T1 time and reductions in LV mass/volumes in HV, whereas
we observed the opposite, suggesting this does not explain our findings. However, future studies with larger
sample sizes that employ more assessments of cardiometabolic health (e.g. measurements of abdominal
obesity) are indicated.

Removal of 3% of the mid-ventricular segments used to calculate mean T1 relaxation time (owing to
identification of artefact) and variation in T1 values between the 6 mid-myocardial segments, may have
altered the mean T1 calculation for some participants thereby influencing results. However, we are reassured
that re-inclusion of these 6 segments in the analysis was not associated with any change in outcomes.
It should be recognised that native myocardial T1 time is not a specific marker of fibrosis. Future studies could
employ further MRI measurements of myocardial fibrosis, such as post-contrast T1 (and extracellular volume
calculation) mapping to provide additional validity, and T2 mapping to examine specifically for myocardial
inflammation, although sensitivity for low-level oedema/inflammation is limiting.36

Implications of our findings
Longer native myocardial T1 times in patients may reflect an early diffuse myocardial fibrosis and/or subclinical myocardial inflammation. Patients were taking a number of different antipsychotics including
clozapine. Pre-clinical data suggest that both clozapine and non-clozapine antipsychotics can induce
myocardial tissue alterations characteristic of fibrosis and inflammation, in a dose-dependent manner.6-10
Thus, our observations are compatible with antipsychotic treatment having a similar effect in humans,
although future studies are required to examine if this is indeed a global effect of treatment, or specific to only
certain drugs. When taken in the context of the broader outcomes of the current study, with longer native T1
times associated with lower ventricular mass, and smaller ventricular and stroke volumes, these findings are
more compatible with a diffuse fibrotic process in patients resulting in reduced myocardial compliance, rather
than a myocarditic process. Indeed, previous in vivo studies have observed that myocarditis is associated with
increased LV mass,37 rather than our observation of a relative decrease in LV mass. Furthermore, although
myocarditis is a recognised complication of clozapine, and 8/14 patients (57%) included in this sample were
prescribed clozapine, patients included in the study were systemically well, with no history suggestive of
myocarditis.
Our findings are in keeping with previous studies examining relationships between interstitial myocardial
fibrosis and broader myocardial structure and function in the general population and in systemic inflammatory
disease states such as rheumatoid arthiritis.38 These studies, after controlling for metabolic syndrome
diagnoses, observe an inverse relationship between myocardial fibrosis and end-diastolic volumes and LV

mass. In preclinical models of aging, the mechanism underlying reductions in LV mass in the context of fibrosis
seem to relate to myocardial collagen fibre deposition and myocyte cell death occurring at a greater rate than
concomitant hypertrophy in remaining myoctes.39 Reductions in end diastolic volumes are thought to be a
consequence of the accumulation of collagen within the myocardium impacting its elasticity and limiting
torsional recoil and ventricular suction.
Compared with the general population, people with schizophrenia are both twice as likely to have a diagnosis
of CVD, and die as a consequence of CVD.1 Thus, the overall findings of this study, compatible with early
diffuse myocardial fibrosis and/or sub-clinical myocardial inflammation in medicated patients with
schizophrenia even in the absence of metabolic disease, could have significant clinical implications. For
example, in various cardiac disease states, including non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and valvular
pathology, myocardial fibrosis independently predicts both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.3 If
antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia is indeed associated with a myocardial fibrotic process, then
establishing the mechanism of these myocardial tissue alterations could potentially lead to identification of
novel therapeutic approaches to reduce mortality rates in schizophrenia.

Future directions
Taken in the context of previous preclinical studies that have observed myocardial fibrotic and inflammatory
changes accompanying antipsychotic administration,6-10 the cardiac alterations observed in the current study
may be the consequence of antipsychotic treatment. Further studies are therefore required to examine the
potential link between antipsychotic medication and myocardial tissue alterations in humans by longitudinally
assessing cardiac function in patients over time; when antipsychotic naïve and then during treatment.
However, the absence of significant correlations between antipsychotic dose/duration of treatment with
native myocardial T1 time could be interpreted as suggesting that antipsychotics do not play a major role in
the observed CMR alterations, although it is recognised that the study is not powered to examine this doseresponse relationship. There is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that psychotic illness is independently
associated with increased markers of oxidative stress and inflammation,31,

in antipsychotic naïve first episode psychosis would also provide insight into the role of physiological
alterations that are putatively intrinsic to psychosis in altering myocardial structure and function.
Finally, studies examining the potential to attenuate accelerated myocardial fibrosis/inflammation in patients
with schizophrenia may be required and could provide insight into novel therapeutic avenues with the
potential to reduce mortality rates of patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, if antipsychotics are implicated in
myocardial tissue alterations, examining antipsychotic dose-related cardiac alterations could guide clinicians
with regards best practice in improving mental health without detrimentally impacting the physical health of
patients. Furthermore, pharmacological interventions designed to target myocardial fibrosis/inflammation
may be of therapeutic worth, and future studies exploring their use in antipsychotic treated individuals
warranted. For example, drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have been observed to
ameliorate myocardial fibrosis not only in preclinical models of hypertension41 and diabetes mellitus,42 but also
in clozapine treated models.43

Conclusions
Patients with schizophrenia taking antipsychotics show myocardial tissue alterations characteristic of an early
diffuse fibrotic/inflammatory process that are not explained by other cardiac risk factors. These alterations
could contribute to excess cardiac mortality rates observed in schizophrenia.

Native myocardial T1 time was longer in SCZ compared with HV (d=0.89; p=0.02); 3B: Indexed left
ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume was smaller in SCZ compared with HV (d=0.92; p=0.02); 3C: Indexed LV
stroke volume was smaller in SCZ compared with HV (d=1.11; p=0.01); 3D: Indexed LV mass was lower in SCZ
compared with HV (d=0.76; p=0.047); 3E: Indexed right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume was smaller in
SCZ compared with HV (d = 0.88; p=0.02); 3F: Indexed RV stroke volume was smaller in SCZ compared with HV
(d=1.00; p=0.01). These findings are consistent with early diffuse myocardial fibrosis in patients with
schizophrenia. d = Cohen’s d effect size for group mean difference. P values correspond to the unpaired t-test
