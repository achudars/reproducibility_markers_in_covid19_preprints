Abstract

22
23

A dose of proanthocyanidins with satiating properties proved to be able to limit body

24

weight increase several weeks after administration under exposure to a cafeteria diet. Here

25

we describe the molecular targets and the duration of the effects. We treated rats with 500

26

mg GSPE/kg BW for ten days. Seven or seventeen weeks after the last GSPE dose, while

27

animals were on cafeteria diet, we used RT-PCR to measure the mRNA of the key energy

28

metabolism enzymes from liver, adipose depots and muscle. We found that a reduction in

29

the expression of adipose Lpl might explain the lower amount of adipose tissue in rats

30

seven weeks after the last GSPE dose. Liver showed increased expression of Cpt1a and

31

Hmgs2 together with a reduction in Fasn and Dgat2. In addition, fatty oxidation (Oxct1 and

32

Cpt1b mRNA) was increased in muscle. However, after seventeen weeks, there was a

33

completely different gene expression pattern. As conclusion, seven weeks after the last

34

GSPE administration there was a limitation in adipose accrual that might be mediated by

35

an inhibition of the gene expression of the adipose tissue Lpl. Concomitantly there was an

36

increase in fatty acid oxidation in liver and muscle.

Introduction

39

Excessive adipose tissue significantly increases the risk and prognosis of metabolic

40

syndrome (diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic

41

fatty liver disease) and several types of cancer.1 The causes of excessive body weight are

42

diverse, one of the most prevalent in developing and developed countries being excessive

43

or bad quality food intake2 .

44

Proanthocyanidins (PACs) are a group of polyphenols that are widespread in nature (in

45

fruits, vegetables and their beverage products). They have been described as bioactive

46

agents against several unhealthy situations. More specifically, they have the well-

47

documented effect of limiting lipid accumulation and favouring lipid oxidation in the

48

organism3 Their effect as specific inhibitors of fat digestion4 and absorption.5 Furthermore,

49

PACs favour lower RQ( Respiratory Quotient) 6,7, due to a higher fat oxidation in liver and

50

muscle6. As they are a group of different compounds, some of the effects could be

51

explained by their interaction with molecules or structures located in the gastrointestinal

52

lumen8,6. They protect against cafeteria diet-induced damage to the intestinal barrier and

53

are anti-inflammatory agents.9 However, the absorbable low-molecular weight flavanols

54

reach intracellular targets inside the body, where they act on different molecular targets

55

to induce increased energy expenditure,3 and prevent cholesterol increase in the

56

organism10, acting as antihipertensives10, antioxidants11) and maintaining glucose

57

homeostasis12.

58

The diversity of structures in proanthocyanidin-rich extracts and their interactions are

59

the reason why some of these effects are highly dependent on the dose used for the studies

60

and the physiological state of the animal 7. Most studies prove that PACs correct cafeteria

61

diet-induced damage13,14. Some studies focus on their possible preventive role in obesity-

62

related pathologies (that is, when they are administered from the beginning of obesogenic

63

diets) 15. However, only very few studies have analysed their long-term effects after sub-

64

chronic treatment16,

65

administer GSPE (Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract) (500 mg/kg) so that it acts most

66

effectively against the damaging effects of an obesogenic diet such as the cafeteria diet17.

67

The results showed that PACs had a surprisingly long-lasting effect on body weight that

68

needed a more in-depth analysis. In the present study, we have further analysed the long-

69

lasting effects of sub-chronic GSPE treatment. We compare the duration of their effects,

70

mainly on the energy metabolism and adipose depots, 7 weeks or 17 weeks after the last

71

GSPE dose.

The grape seed extract enriched in proanthocyanidins (GSPE) was kindly provided by Les

76

Dérivés Résiniques et Terpéniques (Dax, France). According to the manufacturer, the GSPE

77

used in this study (Batch number: 124029) contains monomers of flavan-3-ols (21.3%), and

78

dimers (17.4%), trimers (16.3%), tetramers (13.3%) and oligomers (5-13 units; 31.7%) of

Female rats (Harlan Rcc:Han), each weighing 240-270 g, were purchased from Charles River

83

Laboratories (Barcelona, Spain). After one week of adaptation, they were individually caged

with a standard chow diet (Panlab 04, Barcelona, Spain) and tap water. Experiments were

86

performed after a period of acclimation.

87

Short cafeteria (SC) experiment

88

The animals were randomly distributed into two experimental groups (n=7) and fed a

89

standard chow diet ad libitum (figure 1, supplementary materials). One group of animals

90

received 500 mg GSPE/Kg bw together with a simplified high-fat-high-sucrose diet for 10

91

days. The diet consisted of a palatable hypercaloric emulsion presented in an independent

92

bottle, containing (by weight) 10% powdered skimmed milk, 40% sucrose, 4% lard and

93

0.35% xanthan gum as a stabilizer.19 The GSPE dissolved in tap water was orally gavaged to

94

the animals at 18:00 in a volume of 500 µL, one hour after all the available food had been

95

removed. The animals not supplemented with GSPE received water as a vehicle. After 10

96

days of treatment, all the animals were kept for 18 days on a standard chow diet.

97

Afterwards, the rats started with the cafeteria diet challenge for 35 days (SC). The cafeteria

98

diet consisted of standard chow, bacon, carrots, and sugared milk, which induces voluntary

99

hyperphagia.20 This diet was offered ad libitum every day.

108

A second group of thirty female Wistar rats was challenged with a long-term cafeteria

109

treatment (LC), which was initially similar to the treatment described above. They were

110

organized in three experimental groups (n=10), (figure 1, supplementary materials). One

111

group was given the same amount of GSPE every day for 10 days at the same time, and the

112

control group received the same amount of tap water. During the GSPE treatment period,

113

all the rats were fed standard chow diet. On day eleven, a standard group (STD) stayed on

114

the chow diet, and the two remaining groups started a cafeteria challenge, which in this

115

case was maintained for 17 weeks.

116
117

In both experiments, the GSPE treatments were intragastrically (i.g.) administered 1 h

118

before the onset of the dark cycle. Food intake was measured 20 hours after the daily chow

119

replacement with an accuracy of 0.01 g.

120

Blood and Tissue Collection

121

At the end of the study, the rats were fasted for 1-4 hours, anesthetized with sodium

122

pentobarbital (70 mg/kg body weight; Fagron Iberica, Barcelona, Spain) and exsanguinated

123

from the abdominal aorta. The blood was collected using heparin (Deltalab, Barcelona,

124

Spain) as an anticoagulant. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation (1500g, 15 minutes, 4°C)

125

and stored at −80°C until analysis. The different white adipose tissue depots

126

(retroperitoneal (rWAT), mesenteric (mWAT) and periovaric (oWAT)), brown adipose tissue

127

(BAT), liver and pancreas were rapidly removed and weighed.

128

All the procedures were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of the

129

Universitat Rovira i Virgili (code: 0152S/4655/2015).

Plasma -hydroxybutyrate was analysed by colorimetry (BEN, Mainz, Alemania). Total

132

ghrelin from plasma samples was analysed with an extraction-free total ghrelin enzyme

133

immunoassay (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, USA). 21. Plasma insulin and glucagon

134

levels were analysed with rat ELISA kits (Mercodia, Sweeden). Plasma leptin levels were

135

analysed with an ELISA kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).

136

Tissue triglycerides and mRNA quantification

137

Pancreatic triglycerides were assayed according to Castell et al.22 Total RNA was extracted

138

using Trizol (Ambion, USA) and trichloromethane-ethanol (Panreac, Barcelona, Spain) and

139

purified using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Complementary DNA was

140

obtained using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems,

141

Madrid, Spain), and the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-

142

PCR) amplification was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and the

143

respective specific TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems, Madrid, Spain). The relative

144

expression of each mRNA was calculated against the control group using the 2-ΔΔCt method,

145

with cyclophilin A as reference.

146

Statistical analysis

147

The data are represented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical

148

comparisons between groups were assessed by the T test. Analyses were performed with

Sub-chronic treatment with GSPE reduces food intake in rats on a palatable diet

154

In previous studies we used a GSPE dose that has satiating properties in animals on a chow

155

diet.7,23 Here, we reproduce this effect in animals with an enhanced appetite because they

156

were offered a tasty diet. Figure 1a shows a 10% reduction in the total food intake of the

157

healthy females while they were treated with GSPE. Table 1 shows that this reduction was

158

due to the amount of hypercaloric emulsion ingested.

The effects on food intake disappeared when GSPE administration finished, as previously

lipids and 20% from protein. When the animals were subsequently subjected to a short (35

182

days) cafeteria diet, the amount of Kcal ingested was not different between the groups

either (figure 1c). During this last period of the study, animals obtained 54% ± 0.020 of

A reduction in the expression of adipose LPL might explain the lower amount of adipose

190

tissue in GSPE pre-treated rats

191

We have shown that a 10-day pre-treatment with GSPE followed by a cafeteria diet led to

192

a reduction in adiposity and RQ17 after 53 days. Table 2 shows that in the GSPE pre-treated

193

group there is a statistically significant reduction of around 35% in the size of subcutaneous

194

depots (estimated by the difference between total adipose contents measured by RMN

195

and the weighed intraabdominal depots). Although the mRNA levels of lipid metabolism

196

genes did not help to explain it, there was a statistically significant effect on the ratio

197

between Cpt1b(carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b) vs Fasn(fatty acid synthase), suggesting a

198

trend towards a higher oxidative profile in the subcutaneous depot. The next most

199

abundant WAT depot is the periovaric WAT, which did not show any differences between

200

the control and GSPE groups in either weight or gene expression. Instead, the

201

retroperitoneal and mesenteric depots were of statistically different sizes due to the GSPE

202

treatment (reductions of 23 and 35%, respectively). However, there were no significant

203

changes in the gene expression profile, only a tendency to present lower Fasn mRNA levels

204

in mesenteric WAT (table 2).

Brown adipose tissue was also analysed but there were no changes due to GSPE either in

214

weight (0.91 ± 0.07 for the cafeteria group; 0.77 ± 0.04 for the GSPE-pre-treated group) or

215

in Cpt1b gene expression (1.02 ± 0.0 for the cafeteria group; 1.15 ± 0.2 for the GSPE-pre-

216

treated group) suggesting a lack of effect on oxidative activity in this tissue.

217

Next, to identify the effects of GSPE on triglyceride entry into adipose tissue, we measured

218

the gene expression of the genes related to this process: Lpl(lipoprotein lipase), the enzyme

219

that hydrolyses triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol, before their uptake into the cell;

220

Cd36(CD36 molecule), involved in free fatty acid uptake into the cell; and Aqp7(aquaporin 7),

221

which facilitates the efflux of glycerol from the cell. Figure 2 shows that the amount of Lpl

222

in the mesenteric depot was highly reduced, as was the amount of Aq7. There were no

223

statistically significant differences for the fatty acid transporter (Cd36).

Lipid oxidation in liver and muscle is higher

236

In our search for an explanation for the lower RQ observed in GSPE pre-treated rats,17 we

237

analysed liver and muscle gene expressions. Figure 3a shows a significant increase in Cpt1a

238

(carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) and Hmgs2(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2),

239

suggesting the increased oxidation of fatty acids and the active synthesis of ketone bodies

240

in the liver of GSPE-pre-treated animals. In addition, decreased Fasn and Dgat

241

Rats were treated with 0.5 g/Kg BW for the first 10 days, and then they were put on a chow

247

diet for 18 days and a cafeteria diet for 35 days. The black column indicates animals not

248

treated with GSPE. The white column indicates animals treated with 0.5 g/Kg BW of GSPE

249

for the first 10 days of treatment. The mRNA extracted from liver was quantified by RT-PCR

250

and the relative gene expression detailed gens was obtained by the DDCt method in each

251

gene. Figure 3a resumes liver results. Figure 3b summarizes muscle gene expression. The

252

data are the mean ± SEM (n=7). Statistical differences identified by T-test are defined by *

256

Plasma ketone bodies were not significantly modified (control: 4.14 ± 0.35; GSPE: 3.89 ±

257

0.56; mM), so we measured the extent to which they could be oxidized by muscle. Figure

258

3b shows a strong significant increase in Oxct1(3-oxoacid CoA transferase 1) due to GSPE

259

treatment, concomitantly with a tendency to increased Cpt1b, which suggests that ketone

260

bodies and fatty acids are the energy source in the muscle.

Hormonal status of GSPE-treated rats after the short-cafeteria study

263

We next analysed the effects of GSPE on key hormones for the regulation of energetic

264

homeostasis 7 weeks after finishing the GSPE treatment.

265

In pancreas, GSPE pre-treatment did not change insulin mRNA levels (1.16 ± 0.25 in

266

controls; 0.66 ± 0.11 in the GSPE pre-treated group; A.U.) but showed a tendency towards

267

a lower glucagon mRNA (1.16 ± 0.23; 0.60 ± 0.14; A. U.; p= 0.06). The amount of

triglycerides(TG) in pancreas was not modified in GSPE pre-treated rats (29.66 ± 2.21 in the

269

control group and 27.10 ± 4.21 in the GSPE pre-treated group- g TG/ mg tissue).

270

GSPE pre-treatment statistically increased the plasma levels of total ghrelin (ng/mL;

271

control: 4.09 ± 0.15; GSPE: 6.10 ± 0.42; p<0.05), although stomach mRNA levels of this

272

hormone were not modified by GSPE pre-treatment (control: 1.04 ± 0.16; GSPE: 1.05 ±

273

0.12). In addition, GSPE pre-treatment led to a trend towards lower leptinemia (ng/mL;

274

control: 28.0 ± 4.04; GSPE: 18.02 ± 2.15; p=0.07).

275
276

Duration of GSPE effects

277

Finally, to estimate the duration of some of the effects described above, we analysed

278

several parameters after a longer (17 weeks) cafeteria challenge.

279

The gene expression profile in liver differed considerably from that found in the short-

280

challenge study (table 3). GSPE pre-treatment led to an increase in Fasn and Dgat2 and a

281

decrease in Cpt1a compared to the cafeteria treatment. This profile resembled that of the

282

standard group of animals.

Discussion

296

Grape-seed derived proanthocyanidins have been extensively studied, but few studies use

297

doses that are higher than can be provided by standard food ingestion but which may be

298

interesting for a potential functional food. We showed that a dose of 0.5 g GSPE/kg bw has

299

satiating properties in healthy rats7 and limits adipose accumulation induced by a cafeteria

300

diet.17 We have also shown that GSPE maintains some of its antiobesogenic effects for a

301

long period after GSPE administration finishes. In the present study, we analysed the

302

mechanisms that explain this. We show that GSPE limits adipose fat pad accumulation until

303

seven weeks after the last GSPE administration due to an inhibition in the adipose tissue

304

Lpl. An increase in fatty acid oxidation in liver and muscle compensates for the inability of

305

fatty acids to accumulate in WAT.

306

First, we show that GSPE also inhibits food intake if the diet is a tasty one (energy dense).

307

During the ten-day GSPE treatment, animals reduced energy intake by 10% in comparison

308

to the control group. Furthermore, these rats gained 30% less weight than the control

309

(cafeteria) group.17 These results confirm that GSPE effects on food intake are additive to

310

slimming effects because the lipid oxidation of GSPE is activated.7 In our short-term

311

experiment, after GSPE intake, animals changed to a chow diet, and showed no changes in

312

body weight accrual. Unexpectedly, when the rats were again fed a cafeteria diet (still

313

without GSPE), the differences in body weight reappeared. These differences were around

314

40% between GSPE pre-treated animals and the control group, which correlate with the

315

lower adiposity (79%),17 and there were no differences in either the quantity or quality of

316

food intake. Our results, therefore, show that GSPE only has long-lasting anti-obesity

317

effects under exposure to a high fat and/or a high sucrose diet.

318

A key element in triglyceride food-derived storage is the adipose lipoprotein lipase (Lpl).

319

GSPE pre-treatment limited the amount of Lpl mRNA in mesenteric adipose tissue, which

320

suggested an impairment of triglyceride storage in this tissue. Lpl has been shown to be a

321

target for GSPE by Del Bas and col.24 They showed that five hours after an acute dose of

322

250 mg GSPE/kg bw there was a reduction in adipose Lpl mRNA. The results of the study by

323

Yoon and col are more similar to ours.25 They showed that Allomyrina dichotoma larvae

324

treatment had a considerable effect on Lpl mRNA because it limits adipose tissue growth

325

in mice fed a high-fat diet. However, adipose Lpl limitation by itself is not sufficient to

326

explain all GSPE effects. Weinstock and col, working with Lpl knockout mice that maintain

327

Lpl expression only in muscle, showed no changes in the various adipose depots or in total

328

lipid content.26 This suggests that in our study, GSPE might also act on other targets in the

329

body.

330

If triglycerides cannot be stored in WAT after GSPE treatment, they might be derived to

331

other organs. One of these organs is the liver, where GSPE pre-treatment directed fatty

332

acids towards -oxidation, as we found increased expression of CPT1a concomitantly with

333

lower esterification (Dgat2). Cpt1a was also found to be up-regulated after two acute doses

334

of 250 mg GSPE/kg bw27 in chow-fed rats but not after a subchronic treatment for 10 days

335

with 25 mg/kg bw5 in 13-week cafeteria-fed rats. Baselga and col28 found a similar trend to

336

ours in Fasn and Cpt1a mRNA levels after three weeks with a dose of 25 mg/kg bw in rats

337

that had previously been on a cafeteria diet for 10 weeks. The main difference between

338

our results and Baselga’s is that that they found that GSPE decreased liver triglycerides but

339

we did not. On the contrary, our results show that triglycerides increased in the liver of the

340

GSPE pre-treated rats.29 However, when we analyse the long cafeteria challenge (17

341

weeks) the triglyceride content in the GSPE pre-treated group did not differ from content

342

in the vehicle-treated group, which suggests a limited trend toward their accumulation in

343

liver. Yang-Xue and col,30 working with partially KO mice for Lpl, showed a strong Lpl mRNA

344

inhibition in the youngest animals that was partially reduced with aging. These animals also

345

showed an increased deposition of triglycerides in the liver in adulthood due to the KO gene

346

that reverted the aging period. We worked with different treatments, different species and

347

different durations, but we noticed a changing relationship between GSPE pre-treated rats

348

and the amount of liver triglycerides, which suggests that time affects the accrual of

349

triglycerides in the liver.

350

In the short-cafeteria study, GSPE pre-treated rats sent more triglycerides to the liver,

351

oxidized fatty acids and produced ketone bodies, which were then removed by muscle. In

352

fact, del Bas and col also showed an increase in the mRNA of muscle LPL,24 which suggests

353

a derivation of fatty acids from adipose tissue to muscle that we cannot ignore. Similarly,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/570994; this version posted March 7, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

354

fatty-acid uptake and oxidation were also found to be activated in muscle (higher mRNA

355

Cpt1b, Lpl and Cd36) in males on a 10-week cafeteria diet that subsequently received 21

356

days of 25 mg GSPE/kg BW.6 Besides, the dose of GSPE does not seem to have a critical

357

effect on muscle, as Crescenti and col found an overexpression of genes related to fatty

358

acid uptake (Fatp1 and CD36) and b-oxidation in the skeletal muscle of STD-GSPE

359

offsprings.16 So the higher oxidation of fatty acids in liver and muscle explain the lower RQ

360

found in the GSPE pre-treated rats, a common trait of several GSPE treatments.3

361
362

It is important to point out that the metabolic changes remain for some considerable time

363

after GSPE treatment. There may be several explanations for this. On the one hand, GSPE

364

is an extract composed of absorbable compounds and non-absorbable structures.

365

Absorbable compounds can reach the various tissues assayed

366

structures can interact with intestinal sensors33. Through their interaction with microbiota,

367

they can produce new compounds that can reach different targets in the body34,35. Thus,

368

we cannot discount that there might be flavonoids remaining in the tissues. However,

369

previous studies with a lower dose (100 mg GSPE/kg bw) administered for a longer time

370

(12 weeks) suggested that flavonoids do not accumulate in liver or mesenteric adipose

371

tissue.36 Another explanation might be that some epigenetic activity is taking place in the

372

target tissues. GSPE modified liver miR-33a and miR-12237 at doses as low as 5 mg/kg BW

373

for 3 weeks after a 15-week cafeteria diet. Similarly, Milenkovinc and col38 found changes

374

in hepatic miRNA working with doses of proanthocyanidins closer to 5 mg/kg BW for two

375

weeks. GSPE activity on histone deacetylases was proved by Downing and col39, who

376

showed that GSPE regulates liver HDAC and Pparα activities to modulate lipid catabolism

31,32

and non-absorbable

377

and reduce serum triglycerides in vivo. Similarly, Bladé and col proved that PACs modulate

378

hepatic class III HDACs, which are often called sirtuins (SIRT1-7), in a dose-dependent

379

manner. This was associated with significant protection against hepatic triglyceride and

380

cholesterol accumulation in healthy rats.10 All this evidence, in conjunction with our

381

findings on the regulation of gene expression in liver 7 weeks after GSPE treatment,

382

suggests an epigenetic modelling of hepatic functioning by GSPE. The duration of these

383

effects after GSPE administration is not clear. Crescenti and col showed effects in offspring

384

24 weeks after GSPE had been administered to their mothers during pregnancy.40 We

385

observe that seventeen weeks after GSPE treatment Ctp1a, Fasn and Dgat2 expression in

386

the liver changed profile compared to 7 weeks after GSPE, which suggests that hepatic

387

epigenetic regulation had come to an end. Instead, at this time point, the changes in liver

388

clearly agree with the insulin/glucagon ratio modulation by GSPE. In fact, we showed that

389

GSPE (45 days with 25 mg GSPE per kg of body weight) modulates pancreatic miRNAs.41

390

miR-483, which we showed is down-regulated by GSPE treatment in rat pancreatic islets,

391

has been related to the optimum equilibrium between -cells and -cells (that is, its

392

upregulation leads to increased insulin production and decreased glucagon synthesis).42

393

Therefore, our results also point to epigenetic changes in pancreas, which will need to be

394

addressed in future work.

395
396

In conclusion, a short-term pre-treatment with GSPE repressed adipose Lpl and activated

397

fatty oxidation in the liver. In conjunction with a greater utilization of ketone bodies in

398

muscle, this would help to prevent an increase in body weight caused by a long-term high-

399

fat diet after the end of treatment.
