Abstract

27

As bioprocess intensification has increased over the last 30 years, yields from

28

mammalian cell processes have increased from 10’s of milligrams to over 10’s of grams per

29

liter. Most of these gains in productivity have been due to increasing cell numbers in the

30

bioreactors, and with those increases in cell numbers, strategies have been developed to

31

minimize metabolite waste accumulation, such as lactate and ammonia. Unfortunately, cell

32

growth cannot occur without some waste metabolite accumulation, as central metabolism is

33

required to produce the biopharmaceutical. Inevitably, metabolic waste accumulation leads to

34

decline and termination of the culture. While it is understood that the accumulation of these

35

unwanted compounds imparts a less than optimal culture environment, little is known about the

36

genotoxic properties and the influence of these compounds on global genome instability. In this

37

study, we examined the effects on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells’ genome sequences and

38

physiology due to exposure to elevated ammonia levels. We identified genome-wide de novo

39

mutations, in addition to variants in functional regions of certain genes involved in the mismatch

40

repair (MMR) pathway, such as DNA2, BRCA1 and RAD52, which led to loss-of-function and

41

eventual genome instability. Additionally, we characterized the presence of microsatellites

42

against the most recent Chinese Hamster genome assembly and discovered certain loci are not

43

replicated faithfully in the presence of elevated ammonia, which represents microsatellite

44

instability (MSI). Furthermore, we found 124 candidate loci that may be suitable biomarkers to

45

gauge genome stability in CHO cultures.

Introduction
Biopharmaceutical manufacturing represents nearly 2% of the total US GDP [1],thus an

49

important driver of the US economy. Biopharmaceuticals include monoclonal antibodies,

50

recombinant proteins, and assemblies of proteins produced by biological means. Commercial

51

products are used as blood factors, thrombolytic agents, therapeutics, growth factors,

52

interferons, and vaccines [2, 3].The most common mammalian cell line used is the CHO cell

53

line, due to its ability to produce biopharmaceutical molecules with post-translational

54

modifications required in humans [4]. However, it is well understood that recombinant CHO cell

55

lines are susceptible to genome instability that is often observable after approximately 70

56

generations [5-8]. This genome instability reduces longevity in continuous culture; and

57

productivity can be limited in fed-batch systems [9, 10]. A common occurrence in both

58

continuous cultures and fed-batch systems is the accumulation of metabolic waste products,

59

such as ammonia and lactate [11, 12]. The effects of these waste products on genome

60

instability per se have not been directly assessed.

61

Microsatellite instability (MSI) is the observation of genetic hypermutability at

62

microsatellite loci, where a high frequency of insertion or deletion (indel) mutations accumulate

63

during cell division [13, 14]. Furthermore, the observation of MSI is evidence that the MMR

64

machinery is not functioning properly [15]. Rather than correcting errors that occur

65

spontaneously during DNA replication, cells with impaired MMR systems accumulate these

66

errors globally, which are then passed on to daughter cells during division to become amplified

67

as the culture persists. MSI loci are stable genetic biomarkers and have been utilized in the

68

diagnosis of many cancers [16, 17]. Previous studies have shown that approximately 15% of

69

patients with colorectal cancer [15, 18], 20% of patients with stomach cancer [19], and 30% of

70

patients with endometrial cancer [20] could attribute their disease to genome instability that is

71

diagnosed with microsatellite (MS) biomarkers. The clinical uptake of MSI-based diagnostics,

72

such as the Bethesda Panel, demonstrates the reliability and clinical utility of MSI loci as

73

biomarkers [21].

74

In this study, the effect of exposure to elevated levels of ammonia on genome instability

75

during fed-batch cultures of CHO cells was investigated. Specifically, the accumulation of DNA

76

mutations in cells exposed to elevated ammonia were compared to cultures grown under

77

standard fed-batch conditions. Ammonia was added to duplicate parallel cultures at 10 mM and

78

30 mM final concentrations after 12 hours of culture time to establish a mild and high ammonia

79

stress. After 72 hours of exposure to the elevated ammonia, samples were taken for genome

80

sequencing and analysis of resulting SNP and indel variation. The SNPs and indels were

81

mapped to the Chinese hamster genome, and assessed for functional impact in coding genes

82

and presence in predicted microsatellite regions. The relevance of these findings advance our

83

understanding of the genomic factors that lead to culture decline and establish a foundation for

84

the development of DNA-based tools to imporove CHO cell biomanufacturing.

Culture Conditions
A recombinant CHO-K1 Clone A11 from the Vaccine Research Center at the National

90

Institutes of Health (NIH), which expresses the anti-HIV antibody VRC01 (IgG1) was used. The

91

inoculum train was expanded in 250 mL shake flasks with 70 mL ActiPro media (GE Healthcare)

92

maintained at 5% CO2 and 37°C. The bioreactors were ambr®250 bioreactors (Sartorius

93

Stedim, Göttingen, Germany) with two pitched blade impellers and an open pipe sparger (vessel

94

part number: 001-5G25). The bioreactors were inoculated at a target cell density of 0.4 × 106

95

cells/mL in ActiPro batch media and fed daily beginning on Day 3 (3% (v/v) Boost 7a and 0.3%

96

(v/v) Boost 7b (GE Healthcare)). 12-h post inoculation, duplicate cultures were stressed with 0

97

mM, 10 mM, or 30 mM NH4Cl. The 0 mM cultures received equivalent volumes of water instead

98

of the NH4Cl solution. Dissolved oxygen was controlled at 50% of air saturation using PID

99

control that increased the O2 mixture in the gas sparge to 100%, then the stir speed from 300 to

100

600 rpm. 10% Antifoam Solution (SH30897.41 – GE Heathcare) was added as needed for foam

101

control. For the ambr® 250, all gases were supplied through the open pipe sparger. Overlay

102

gassing was not used. The pH was controlled via sparging CO2 and air, and base pump

103

(NaOH). The pH setpoint was 7.0 with a 0.2 deadband. Temperature was controlled at 37°C.

104

Samples for MSI analysis were harvested at 84 hours culture time (72 hours post-stress) and

105

centrifuged at approximately 2,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed,

106

and the pellet was stored at -80°C.

DNA extraction, whole genome sequencing, and microsatellite variant discovery
Approximately 250 g cell pellets were pre-washed with 1X phosphate buffered saline

110

(PBS) prior to extraction. Total genomic DNA (gDNA) was purified with the DNAeasy Blood and

111

Tissue Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s recommended procedures. Whole genome

112

shotgun sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq (2x150 paired end) through a third-

113

party vendor. Raw sequence data was assessed for quality with the FASTQC software

114

(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Raw sequence data was

115

preprocessed to remove low quality bases and adapter sequences with the Trimmomatic

116

software v.0.38 [22]. Preprocessed reads were aligned to the CriGri-PICR version assembly of

117

the Chinese hamster genome (Cricetulus griseus) (RefSeq assembly accession:

118

GCF_003668045.1) with the Bowtie2 v.2.3.4.1 short read aligner [23]. Alignments were

119

coordinate sorted and indexed with SamTools v1.3.1 [24]. SNPs and indels were determined

120

with the HaploTypeCaller Walker from the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK v.4.0) [25].

121

Functional SNPs were characterized with the SNPeffect software, v4.3 [26]. Genome-wide

122

microsatellite loci were determined against the PICR CH assembly with MISA, a microsatellite

123

finder software [27]. Microsatellite loci were intersected with indel coordinates using BedTools

124

Intersect command 2.27.1 [28] to identify indel variants associated with microsatellites.

Text/Data mining and Functional enrichment analysis

127

The query “genomic instability [MeSH Terms]“ was used to search PubMed to retrieve

128

the abstracts with PMIDs (13889 matched). The PubTator [29] tool was used to collect genes

129

annotated in these abstracts with Entrez Gene IDs. Among the 5098 retrieved genes, 3054

130

genes were human (Homo sapiens), 845 genes were mouse (Mus musculus), representing the

131

two largest groups of species. The ortholog pairs among human, mouse and Chinese hamster

132

were mapped with NCBI ortholog assignment

133

(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/gene_orthologs.gz). 15536 pairs of 1-to-1 human/Chinese

134

hamster orthologs were obtained, which served as background for DAVID [30, 31]

135

(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) enrichment analysis. For the SNP lists with high, moderate, or

136

low mutation effects, the Chinese hamster genes were mapped with corresponding human

137

orthologs, then DAVID was used to obtain the enriched gene clusters, functional annotation

138

clusters and charts for the given gene lists.

139

In other studies, environmental stressors, such as UV radiation [32], mutagenic

140

compounds , and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [33], have demonstrated negative effects on

141

genome integrity at the nucleotide level. For instance, ROS in tobacco smoke oxidize guanine

142

bases to form 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), which results in the accumulation of single nucleotide

143

polymorphisms (SNPs) [34]. SNP accumulation over time can lead to global genome instability

144

in smokers, which is widely considered to be the leading cause of lung cancer in smokers [35].

145

Likewise, mutations, such as synonymous base changes in coding and regulatory regions, have

146

little to no effect on gene transcription and translation. Yet, non-synonymous changes can have

147

drastic effects on gene expression and cellular function. Specifically, alterations in critical genes

148

that encode DNA MMR machinery can lead to global genome instability by failing to repair

149

errors caused by a variety of events such as replication stalling [36], replication fork collapse

150

[37, 38], double-strand breaks [39, 40], or environmental stressors.

Identification of candidate MSI loci
The prevalence of indel mutations that intersect microsatellite loci are high in the

154

ammonia stressed and control samples. In order to prioritize a list MSI loci with high

155

confidence, a filtering strategy that leverages several criteria was established. First, each

156

variable genomic locus was assigned a ‘mutation-score’ which is a proportion of the number of

157

variant reads (allelic depth) by the total depth of reads for each site. Next, genomic sites were

158

further ranked by ordering sites with the largest ‘mutation-score’ and then subtracting control

159

samples from the treatment samples to identify sites where treated samples contained

160

mutations and the controls did not, with sufficient depth of reads. The final ranked set of

161

candidate MSI loci contain sites where control samples do not contain any variant reads, with

162

sufficient read depth in each sample. The filtering method is summarized below in Fig 1.

168

Growth and metabolite profiles

169

CHO cells were cultured in highly controlled ambr® 250 bioreactors for 12 hours prior to

170

the addition of ammonia to stress the cultures. Up to 1.5 days, there was no observable

171

difference in the viable cell density (VCD); however, by 2.5 days, the 30 mM ammonia-stressed

172

cultures had substanially decreased VCD compared to the control and 10 mM stressed cultures

173

(Fig 2A). The ammonia profiles are shown in Fig 2B. The 10 mM ammonia-stressed cultures

174

had similar VCDs to the control cultures until Day 7; yet always had cell viabilities that were

175

similar to the control cultures. In contrast, the 30 mM ammonia-stressed cultures reach peak

176

VCD on Day 4 and the cultures were harvested on Day 8.5 due to low viability (< 70%). A cell

177

viability below 70% is a standard harvesting threshold. The samples for genome sequencing

178

were taken at 84 hours of culture time (Day 3.5), i.e. 72 hours post-stress. At the time of harvest

179

of genome sequencing samples, the viability for all samples was greater than 90% (Fig 2A).

180

The glucose and lactate profiles (Fig 2D, E) indicate that the control and 10 mM ammonia-

181

stressed cultures had very similar metabolic characteristics throughout the entire cultures;

182

however, the product titer was lower for the 10 mM ammonia-stressed cultures (Fig 2C). In

183

contrast, the 30 mM ammonia-stressed cultures accumulated glucose and lactate after Day 5,

184

due to the feeding protocol and the lack of cell growth. All cultures received the feed Boost 7a,

185

which contains glucose, based on the culture volume and not the VCD. It is well-known that

186

excessive glucose causes lactate accumulation [12]. Amino acid profiles were also obtained for

187

these cultures. The most interesting amino acid profile was for alanine, where the 10 mM and

188

30 mM ammonia-stressed culture profiles were very similar through Day 6, while the control

189

culture has a significantly different profile (Fig 2F). Otherwise, the control and 10 mM ammonia-

190

stressed cultures had similar profiles, even if the concentrations were not identical. In summary,

191

the samples for the genome sequencing analysis were taken when there were no substantial

192

VCD, viability, or metabolic difference between the control and 10 mM ammonia-stressed

193

cultures, and only the VCD for the 30 mM ammonia-stressed cultures was indicative of the

194

stress (Fig 2).

Whole genome shotgun sequences were collected for the control and treated samples to

an approximate depth of 15X coverage to assess the genomic impact of elevated ammonia

205

exposure. Variant discovery identified a total of 79,097 indels and 310,597 SNPs (Supporting

206

Tables S1 and S8 respectively). Of the 310,597 SNPs, we found a total of 4,785 SNPs that

207

were contained within protein coding or regulatory sequences including: untranslated regions

(UTRs), exons, and introns (Supporting Table S9). A PANTHER analysis of SNPs was

209

conducted and identified 1,806 coding genes impacted in the ammonia-stressed cultures. The

210

molecular functions of the affected genes and their biological processes are summarized in Fig

35.1% and 34.6% respectively. The other 5 major impacted molecular function categories

213

include transporter activity (8.15%), molecular function regulator (6.62%), transcription regulator

214

activity (6.04%), molecular transducer activity (5.67%), and structural molecule activity (3.56%).

215

The major biological processes impacted by SNP genes involve cellular process (32.7%),

Functional enrichment profiling of genes with high-impact SNPs
As there are significantly more literature reports on genome instability in human than in

224

Chinese hamster, a text and data mining approach was used to identify potential Chinese

225

hamster genes involved in genome instability under ammonia stress by use of orthology to

226

human. Through text/data mining, 3,054 human genes were identified as candidate genes

227

related to genome instability by the PubMed search with “genomic instability [MeSH Terms]”,

228

combined with PubTator gene annotations (Supporting Table S15). Among them, 2,521 genes

229

had 1-to-1 protein-coding orthologs in Chinese hamster genome (Supporting Table S15).

230

DAVID gene enrichment analysis identified highly enriched GO- Biological Process (BP), GO-

231

Molecular Function (MF) and KEGG-pathway among these 2,521 human genes. Hundreds of

232

genes were enriched in DNA repair, DNA damage response, DNA replication, cell division,

233

transcription regulation and apoptotic process regulation (Supporting Table S16).

234

For the 1276 Chinese Hamster genes with detected SNPs of high (e.g., stop gained,

235

splice donor variant and intron variant) and moderate (e.g., missense variant and splice region

236

variant) effect in our ammonia stressed samples, the corresponding human orthologs were

237

subject to DAVID analysis to identify enriched functions (Supporting Tables S11-S14). Top

238

enriched KEGG pathways include Glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, ECM-receptor interaction,

239

ribosome biogenesis, focal adhesion, Amoebiasis, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and

240

regulation of actin cytoskeleton (Supporting Table S13).

241

For the 122 genes with high SNP effect, DAVID generated gene clusters and functional

242

annotation clusters mostly with relatively low enrichment scores, which suggests quite distinct

243

functions among those genes. Table 1 lists the identified genomic instability (GI) genes by

244

mapping with text-mined human GI genes, as well as referencing the review [41]. It is notable

245

that DAVID identified four genes in pyrimidine metabolism (KEGG pathway hsa00240), three

246

genes in DNA replication (KEGG pathway hsa03030), four genes in carbohydrate metabolic

247

process (GO:0005975), three genes in telomere maintenance via recombination (GO:0000722),

248

five genes in mitotic nuclear division (GO:0007067), and four genes in negative regulation of

249

neuron apoptotic process (GO:0043524) (see details in Supporting Table S10). To check

250

against the results from DAVID, especially mindful of its knowledgebase last updated in 2016,

251

GO enrichment analysis was also conducted on http://geneontology.org/ with tool powered by

252

PANTHER Classification System [42], which is maintained up to date with GO annotations

253

(Supporting Tables S11 and S13). It is affirmative that over twenty genes are identified as

254

involved in cell cycle (GO:0007049) by PANTHER enrichment analysis (Table 1 and Supporting

255

Table S10).

Microsatellite and candidate MSI loci
A whole-genome scan for microsatellites discovered a total of 409,628 loci, with motifs

267

that varied from di- to tetranucleotide repeats (Supporting Table S2).

As expected, the

268

microsatellites comprised of dinucleotide repeats were the most prevalent with a total of

269

287,124. Trinucleotide and tetranucleotide motifs were less abundant with 46,602 and 75,902

270

occurrences, respectively. From the genomic variant data, 79,097 indels and 310,597 SNPs

271

were observed. Complete lists of indels and SNPs can be found in Supporting Tables S1 and

272

S8 respectively. An ideal locus to be used as a biomarker, demonstrated in Fig 4, would have

273

no mutations in the control cultures, some indel events in 10 mM ammonia-stressed cultures,

274

and more pronounced indel events in 30 mM ammonia-stressed cultures.

275
276

Fig 4: IGV image of a microsatellite located at NW_020822591.1:7780616. Note that the

277

control sample has no mutations, the mildly-stressed sample has five, and the highly-stressed

278

sample has six.

279
280

Using a mutation score and stringent filters, we developed a panel set of 124 MSI loci

281

that could be ordered by priority for follow up research. Assigning mutation scores to individual

282

loci was the most effective way to quantify respective mutation rates. It is important to note that

283

because the mutation score is calculated using the allelic depth; loci with more reads are

284

statistically more significant than those with fewer reads. With this in mind, the 124 candidate

285

loci may not be all inclusive of the optimal loci due to the variation in read depth across the

286

genome. The number of loci remaining after each filter step is summarized in Table 2, the full

287

list of loci in each step can be found in Supporting Tables S4-S7, and the location of all

288

candidate loci are summarized in Table 3.

Discussion

299
300

Ammonia is a common metabolic waste product in cell culture, and the accumulation of

301

this waste leads to decreased productivity of the culture over time. In this study, mild (10 mM)

302

and high (30 mM) ammonia stresses were used to investigate the effects of this byproduct on

303

genome stability. The VCD, cell viability, and metabolic profiles indicated that the high ammonia

304

stress significantly impacted the culture health, as most of these profiles were significantly

305

different from the control and mild ammonia stress culture within 96 hours (4 days) of the

306

ammonia addition (Fig 2). Additionally, the product titer for the high ammonia stressed culture

307

was severely lowered (Fig 2C). In contrast, the culture profiles for the mild ammonia stressed

308

cultures were not significantly different from the control, except for the alanine profile beginning

309

at 84 hours (Day 3.5). However, the effects of the mild stress were eventually realized around

310

the 132 hour point (Day 5.5) where we observed reduced productivity. These culture profiles

311

indicate that ammonia impacts CHO cells in a dose dependent manner, and even mild ammonia

312

stress has an influence on culture productivity. Until now, efforts have mainly focused on

313

transcriptome and proteome effects of ammonia stress [11, 43, 44].

314

The relatively abrupt effects of ammonia on culture health and productivity can be linked

315

to genetic underpinnings. Whole genome sequencing and variant discovery of SNPs allowed for

316

the identification of genotypic changes caused by the ammonia stress. More than 1800 gene

317

variants were identified to be unique in the ammonia stressed samples, including genes

318

involved in MMR. An impaired or inefficient MMR system can lead to the accumulation of

319

mutations in functional genes over cell divisions that are critical to the cell’s survival and can

320

lead to loss of genetic stability [45] or disease states, such as cancer [46]. The need for a highly

321

conserved MMR system can be observed by the presence of multiple orthologs of MutS and

322

MutL in eukaryotic genomes [47]. MutS binds to base mismatches or small indels [48, 49] while

323

MutL is responsible for communicating the identification of mismatch events to downstream

324

elements of MMR such as exonucleases [50].

325

Under normal circumstances, DNA replication errors are a normal part of the replication

326

process, but are usually corrected immediately through proofreading or mismatch repair [51];

327

however, exposure to environmental stress has been shown to underlie error correction fidelity

328

of the MMR machinery, leading to an accelerated rate of variant accumulation and loss of

329

genetic stability [52]. In this study, ammonia stress led to the accumulation of genomic variants,

330

which were observed within 72 hours of the stress (culture time 84 hours). Variant effect

331

prediction found high-impact mutations [26], such as loss of function, frame shift, stop loss, and

332

start gain that leads to an altered gene function in genes involved in genome stability, as a

333

result of ammonia stress (Table 1). For example, critical genes, such as Breast Cancer

334

susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1), RAD52, DNA Replication Helicase/Nuclease 2 (DNA2), and

335

DNA Polymerase Epsilon, Catalytic Subunit (POLE) were impaired. BRCA1 is a tumor

336

suppressor gene that serves a variety of cellular processes including DNA repair, maintaining

337

chromosome stability, and transcription regulation in response to DNA damage. Loss of function

338

mutations in BRCA1 have been linked to familial breast and ovarian cancer due to the critical

339

role it plays in genome stability [53]. Many studies of RAD52 in yeast have identified its role in

340

homology directed repair as a recombination mediator that allows for the repair of double-strand

341

breaks [54-56]. Without homology directed repair, double-strand breaks are considerably more

342

likely to be repaired inaccurately. Furthermore, a recent study suggests that RAD52 also works

343

to stabilize stalled replication forks and prevent their collapse [57].

344

Other biological processes and molecular functions that were affected included DNA

345

integrity maintenance, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and pyrimidine metabolism. Genes

346

such as alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase 2 (A3GALT2), carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3

347

(CHST3), glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1), glycerol kinase 2 (GK2)

348

had variants, where the reading frame was altered which could affect gene function or result in

349

complete loss of function. Additionally, some moderate impact variants affected genes with

350

functional roles in other biological processes and pathways that might contribute to recombinant

351

protein expression. One example of an observed moderate impact variant is impaired ribosome

352

biogenesis, which could be correlated with the drastic difference in titers of the cultures with

353

different levels of ammonia stress.

354

Variants in genes that regulate the MMR pathway may be an origin to the cascade of

355

events that leads to genome instability. When the MMR pathway in a cell is compromised,

356

mistakes can occur and propagate indiscriminately across the genome as cell division occurs

357

[47-49] Unfaithful replication of genomic repeats, such as microsatellite repeats, have been

358

used as effective biomarkers in predicting certain diseases, such as cancer [16]. For example,

359

the Bethesda Panel is comprised of only 5 microsatellites in the human genome.

360

diagnostic screen amplifies and sequences this stable set of microsatellite loci, and if more than

361

one locus exhibits indel mutations, the patient is deemed MSI high, which is indicative of their

362

cancer being attributed to genome instability [21]. Moreover, the fact that only five MSI loci are

363

used for the diagnostic demonstrates how few microsatellite loci in the human genome exhibit

364

the ideal behavior of a diagnostic biomarker. In the analysis of the CHO genome under

365

ammonia stress, more than 400,000 predicted microsatellites and nearly 80,000 indels were

366

discovered. When intersecting these two datasets, only 1,022 microsatellites were observed to

367

have indels (Supporting Table S3). To identify priority and rank the list of candidate MSI’s for

368

possible use as a diagnostic tool for CHO cell instability, a ranking strategy was developed that

369

accounted for read depth and mutation frequency, as determined by division of the total number

370

of variant reads by total number of reads. This ranking strategy resulted in a list of 124

371

candidate loci (Table 3) with the potential to be reliable biomarkers of genome instability for

372

CHO cell cultures.

373

For this study, the genome was sequenced to a resolution of 15 reads per base pair. In

374

some regions, the allelic sequencing depth was much higher than others, which could impact

375

the mutation score method employed in this procedure. Nonetheless, the employed filters

376

produced a sufficient number of candidate loci for further experimentation. Indels identified

377

within candidate loci had dose dependent responses to the ammonia concentrations that were

378

not observed in the control cultures. Though our filtering criteria identified 124 candidate loci

379

that have the potential to be used on a diagnostic panel, they should be amplified and

380

sequenced individually in order to form a concise and reliable panel similar to that of the

381

Bethesda Panel.

Conclusion

384
385

The accumulation of metabolic wastes, such as ammonia, has profound effects on CHO

386

culture viability and product quality. Past work has tied ammonia stress to changes in the

387

transcriptome as well as product quality. In this study, the genotoxicity of ammonia was

388

investigated for mild and high ammonia stresses. Both stresses caused observable culture

389

changes, where the high ammonia stress had observable effects on VCD and cell viability soon

390

after the introduction. In contrast, the mild ammonia-stressed culture was not significantly

391

impacted, with the exception of certain metabolites, such as alanine. Yet, the titer production

392

was lower than expected for the mild ammonia-stressed cultures. Interestingly, genome analysis

393

identified many SNPs and indels as well as some potential MSI loci in the mild and high

394

ammonia-stressed cultures, where these mutations were observed to have a dose dependent

395

response. These mutations are propagated through the culture as cells divide and have

396

detrimental impacts on metabolism, reproduction, signaling pathways, as well as many other

397

cellular mechanisms. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that a sufficient number of candidate

398

MSI loci exist within the CHO genome that could be used as DNA biomarkers to monitor culture

399

genomic health. The development of a simple MSI diagnostic could assist in assessing the

400

degree of genome instability in cultures prior to metabolite shifts, which would lead to precision-

401

driven culture system that would ultimately increase productivity. Future applications will be to

402

determine which of the presented candidate MSI loci would be the most effective in a diagnostic

403

panel and to determine whether or not they are stable in other common culture stresses.
