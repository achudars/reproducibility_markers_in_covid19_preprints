ABSTRACT
Microbial co-cultures have been used in several biotechnological applications. Within these cocultures, the micro-organisms tend to interact with each other and perform complex actions visà-vis a single organism. Investigating metabolic interactions in microbial co-cultures is crucial in
designing microbial consortia tailored for specific applications. In this study, we present a pipeline
integrating modelling and experimental approaches to understand metabolic interactions
between organisms in a community. We define a new index named Metabolic Support Index
(MSI), which quantifies the benefits derived by each organism in the presence of the other when
grown as a co-culture. We computed MSI for several experimentally demonstrated co-culture
systems and showed that MSI, as a metric, accurately identifies the organism that derives the
maximum benefit. We also computed MSI for a commonly used yeast co-culture consisting of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis and observed that the latter derives higher benefit
from the interaction. Further, we designed two-stage experiments to study mutual interactions
and showed that P. stipitis indeed derives the maximum benefit from the interaction, as shown
from our computational predictions. Also, using our previously developed computational tool
MetQuest, we identified all the metabolic exchanges happening between these organisms by
analysing the pathways spanning the two organisms. By analysing the HPLC profiles and studying
the isotope labelling, we show that P. stipitis consumes the ethanol produced by S. cerevisiae
when grown on glucose-rich medium under aerobic conditions, as also indicated by our in silico
pathway analyses. Our approach represents an important step in understanding metabolic
interactions in microbial communities through an integrating framework of modelling and
experiments.

1. INTRODUCTION
Microbial co-cultures have been broadly used in several biotechnological applications, owing to
their abilities to produce a broader pool of enzymes, which enable the synthesis or degradation
of complex molecules. They also exhibit division of labour and provide a wider scope to leverage
the joint metabolic capabilities of the organisms vis-à-vis a single organism. Microbial co-cultures
have been employed to carry out complex functions ranging from xenobiotic degradation (1) to
synthesising novel secondary metabolites (2, 3). More recently, the application of co-culture
systems to produce biofuels has also been gaining traction, where groups of micro-organisms,
either wild-type or engineered, have been employed to convert lignocellulosic biomass to
ethanol (4–6).
Besides, there have also been advances in engineering microbial co-cultures to produce fine
chemicals. Such synthetic microbial communities consist of organisms that have been engineered
to communicate with each other via metabolic exchanges. For instance, in one such study (7),
Escherichia coli cells were manipulated by engineering pathways to exchange metabolites for
improving the titres of n-butanol. In a few other studies (8, 9), specialised metabolic pathways
were engineered in separate E. coli cells to produce industrially important chemicals such as
cis, cis-muconic acid, 3-aminobenzoic acid and resveratrol.
In addition to industrial applications, co-culture systems are also useful to understand the
interactions happening between the organisms. The organisms as a community, orchestrate
several complex functions by communicating with one another, commonly via metabolic
interactions (10). These interactions define the relationships between the organisms and shape
the overall structure of the microbial community. Additionally, computational studies have also
provided insights into the pairwise relationships between the organisms in a community (11–16).
Understanding the metabolism of individual organisms, as well as investigating the metabolic
interactions that happen in a community is central to designing a microbial consortium for a given
application. There are likely multiple metabolites being exchanged between the micro-organisms
in a consortium. Experimentally identifying and understanding the role of these metabolic
exchanges and interactions entails the profiling of both intracellular and extracellular
metabolites. Such untargeted metabolomic profiling becomes very difficult (17), especially when
it involves a co-culture of organisms, owing to the characterisation of organisms in the co-culture,
although complete exometabolomic analysis has been recently carried out for a few microbial
communities (18, 19).
In this study, we design a comprehensive workflow integrating computational and experimental
approaches to predict and validate the microbial interactions in a co-culture. We adopt a threepronged approach to study a co-culture of two industrially important yeast species, viz.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis, drawing on computational analyses, physiological
studies and 13C-labelling experiments. First, using our previously developed graph-theoretic
algorithm, MetQuest (20), we quantify the possible benefits derived by the micro-organisms
when they stay together in a community. We propose a new metric called “Metabolic Support
Index (MSI)” to determine which organism derives a relatively higher benefit from the
interaction. We show that this metric can successfully quantify the interactions between the

organisms using a few examples of the previously demonstrated microbial co-cultures. We then
identify the metabolic exchanges happening between S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis and
experimentally demonstrate the predicted metabolic interaction by performing experimental
verifications. To this end, we perform physiological experiments to identify the organisms that
benefit this interaction. Lastly, we perform isotope-labelling studies to determine the metabolic
interactions between the organisms and understand the pathways where the exchange
metabolite is involved. The results from our workflow on this model co-culture system indicate
that P. stipitis benefits from the interaction through the uptake of ethanol produced by
S. cerevisiae when grown on glucose-rich medium under aerobic conditions. Our approach
represents an important step in integrating modelling with experiments to understand and
characterise microbial interactions in communities and underlines the utility of metabolic
modelling to understand, and possibly design microbial communities for specific applications.

2. RESULTS
In this study, we present a pipeline integrating modelling and experimental approaches to
understand the microbial interactions between organisms in a community. As the first step of
this pipeline, we use our previously developed graph-theoretical approach, MetQuest (20) to
study the community metabolic network, and compute the Metabolic Support Index (MSI). This
index quantifies the benefits derived by each organism in the presence of the other when grown
together as a co-culture. We calculate MSI for several experimentally demonstrated co-culture
systems and show that MSI, as a metric, accurately identifies the organism that derives the
maximum benefit. Further, we design two-stage experiments to study mutual interactions and
show that P. stipitis indeed derives the maximum benefit from the interaction, as shown from
our computational predictions Also, we identify the metabolic exchanges happening between S.
cerevisiae and P. stipitis by analysing the pathways spanning the two organisms. Further, using
the HPLC profiles and isotope labelling studies, we show that P. stipitis consumes the ethanol
produced by S. cerevisiae when grown on glucose-rich medium under aerobic conditions, as also
indicated by our in silico pathway analyses.
2.1 Metabolic support index quantifies the benefits derived by organisms in a community
To quantify the benefits derived by the organisms in a community, we compute a metric,
Metabolic Support Index (MSI), as described in Methods. MSI essentially quantifies the fraction
of an organism’s metabolic network that is ‘enabled’ by the presence of the other organism. An
MSI of zero indicates that the organism does not receive any metabolic support from the other,
while an MSI of unity indicates that the organism receives all the metabolites required to ‘enable’
the stuck reactions. We calculated MSI for several pairs of organisms, which have been
experimentally demonstrated to grow together as a community and where mutual interactions
between the organisms have been reported (Table 1). By comparing the MSI of individual
organisms, we determine the organism from the pair that derives the maximum benefit. In
addition, we also quantify the interactions based on the increase in the number of metabolites
produced by one organism in the presence of the other (Supplementary Table 1). Such an
increase points to the synergy and the possible metabolic interactions between the organisms.
These observations are also in agreement with those reported previously (11).

In all the cases considered, organism A (Column 2) derives a higher benefit in the co-culture than
organism B (Column 3). These observations are in exact agreement with those made by the
experimental studies (Column 6), evaluating the relative biomasses of the two organisms and
their ability to co-exist. For instance, we observe that the MSI of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare is
0.1, while that of Bacillus megaterium is 0. This indicates that no additional pathways have been
activated in B. megaterium, in the presence of K. vulgare. On the other hand, in K. vulgare, 41
additional reactions have been activated in the co-culture (Supplementary Table 1), which could
otherwise not take place in the monoculture. These results indicate the additional metabolic
support K. vulgare receives from B. megaterium. It is interesting to note that this co-culture
system has been widely studied for its applications in Vitamin C production; these studies also
indicate that B. megaterium is a helper strain that enhances the growth and proliferation of K.
vulgare (21–23).
In another co-culture consisting of Yarrowia lipolytica and Cellulomonas fimi, we observe that
MSI of Y. lipolytica (0.119) is almost 10 times that of C. fimi (0.014). This is because of the
additional 123 reactions that have been activated in Y. lipolytica in the presence of C. fimi.
Activation of these reactions also points to the enrichment in the metabolic capabilities of the
Y. lipolytica, as also observed from the increase in the scope size of joint metabolic networks
(Supplementary Table 1). These results indicate that Y. lipolytica derives the maximum benefit
when grown as a co-culture with C. fimi. In sum, these results indicate the overall metabolic
benefit that Y. lipolytica receives, which could have led to the increase in its growth in co-culture,
as observed in the experimental studies previously carried out (18). Similarly, in all the other
cases we have considered, we show that the trends in MSI agree exactly with the results
demonstrated experimentally (Table 1).
Next, we calculated the MSI for the co-culture system of our interest consisting of S. cerevisiae
and P. stipitis. Here, we observe that MSI of P. stipitis is 0.063, nearly three times more than that
of S. cerevisiae (0.025). In addition, we observe 21 reactions in P. stipitis that have been enabled
in the presence of S. cerevisiae. These results indicate that P. stipitis benefits the interaction with
S. cerevisiae, which we proceeded to verify using growth kinetic experiments.
2.2 In silico pathway analyses reveals several interesting metabolic exchanges
To investigate the metabolic exchanges between S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis, we exhaustively
enumerated all the pathways on a community metabolic network, using our previously developed
algorithm MetQuest (see Methods). MetQuest identifies all possible pathways from a given set
of seed metabolites to all the reachable metabolites, whose size is less than or equal to the cutoff. The pathway so obtained, is complete, i.e., it contains all the reactions necessary to produce
every metabolite constituting the pathway.
We computed all the pathways starting from D-Glucose in S. cerevisiae that lead to various
metabolites in P. stipitis. We analysed these pathways for the presence of metabolites from
S. cerevisiae that resulted in the production of target metabolites in P. stipitis. In total, we
observed pathways for 668 metabolites produced by P. stipitis. Of these, pathways to 634
metabolites consist of exchange metabolites from S. cerevisiae (Supplementary Table 2). Further,
from all these pathways, we observed a total of 45 metabolites from S. cerevisiae, which are

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/532184; this version posted January 28, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

involved in the pathways producing various metabolites in P. stipitis. Of these 45 metabolites, we
note that acetaldehyde, α-ketoglutarate, ethanol and sorbitol were the most commonly
exchanged metabolites, which were involved in the production of over 400 metabolites in
P. stipitis (Supplementary Figure S1).
Further, to determine if there were any additional benefits in terms of metabolic exchanges
leading to the overall biomass production, we analysed all the pathways from S. cerevisiae Dglucose to the amino acids in P. stipitis. Amongst the 45 metabolites listed above, we observed a
total of 34 exchange metabolites that formed a part of the pathways producing different amino
acids (Supplementary Table 3). It was interesting to note that of the most commonly exchanged
metabolites, acetaldehyde, alpha-ketoglutarate, ethanol and sorbitol take part in the production
of over ten amino acids.
Several studies previously carried out on this coculture have demonstrated its ability to produce
ethanol from a variety of substrates (24, 25). However, from our computational predictions, we
observed ethanol transport from S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis, which participated in the production
pathways of 418 metabolites. We then decided to experimentally check if ethanol was indeed
exchanged between the organisms, as predicted from our pathway analyses. This would provide
us with insights on designing better processes where a co-culture of these organisms is used for
ethanol production.
2.3 P. stipitis exhibits a higher growth in the cell-free supernatant of S. cerevisiae
To check the existence of mutual interactions between S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis, we carried out
mono-culture and co-culture growth kinetics experiments with these organisms on a minimal
medium containing 10 g/L D-glucose as the carbon source (for both the sets of experiments).
From the growth curves (Figure 3), we observed that the co-culture cell density was in between
that of the respective monocultures. This provided indications on the ability of the organisms to
co-exist. Further, the co-culture showed a diauxic pattern of growth curve, indicating that a few
metabolites from the supernatant may serve as the carbon source.
Next, to identify the organism that benefits the interactions, we designed and carried out the
two-stage experiment, as described in methods. Interestingly, from the growth curves of second
stage (Figure 4), we observed that at the end of 24 h, P. stipitis exhibited a 1.34-fold higher cell
density (518.15) when grown in the supernatant of S. cerevisiae, in comparison to that seen in
the control (309.41) at the end of 24 h. In addition to the improved cell density, P. stipitis clearly
exhibited a diauxic growth pattern, indicating the presence of an alternate metabolite in the
supernatant that was used as the carbon source. However, we did not observe any increase in
the cell density of S. cerevisiae when grown in the supernatant of P. stipitis. This observation also
corroborates the higher MSI for P. stipitis in the community, indicating that P. stipitis derives a
higher benefit when grown together with S. cerevisiae under these specific conditions.
2.4 In silico pathway analyses and Isotope labelling studies confirm ethanol transport from
S. cerevisiae to P. stipitis
In the next step, we experimentally determined the metabolic exchanges happening between
S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis using the same two-stage experimental setup. We performed HPLC
analyses on the samples withdrawn at 0 h and 24 h timepoints of the second stage, where

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/532184; this version posted January 28, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

P. stipitis was grown in the supernatant of S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, we observed that the
concentration of ethanol had reduced from 2.44 g/L (in 0 h) to 0 g/L (24 h).
Motivated by the reduction in the ethanol concentration and the predictions of metabolic
exchanges from our computational studies (Sec 2.2), we hypothesised that P. stipitis was
consuming the ethanol produced by S. cerevisiae. To confirm this, we studied the 13C-labelling
patterns of the amino acids arising from ethanol metabolism. We used the metabolic network of
S. cerevisiae to understand the ethanol metabolism in P. stipitis (26). From this, we identified the
sets of amino acids arising directly and indirectly from ethanol metabolism (Supplementary
Figure S2). The former set includes aspartate, valine and alanine. The latter set includes serine,
derived from 3-phosphoglycerate that arises from gluconeogenesis, which is one of the
indispensable pathways when yeasts grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (27). We then
checked for the incorporation of 13C-labels in these amino acids specifically in the (M-57)+
fragment of the respective amino acids. Interestingly, in all these amino acids, we observed
isotopomers with a higher fraction of 13C incorporated (Figure 5). For instance, from the pool of
amino acid aspartate, we find 28% of m4 isotopomer where all the four carbon atoms carry a 13C
label. In addition, we also noted that there is a negligible fraction of m1 isotopomer in all the four
amino acids. Further, we observed that the average carbon labelling (0.39) in these amino acids
is significantly higher than that found in the control (0.015), indicating the uptake of a labelled
metabolite from the supernatant (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, the average carbon
labelling observed in the amino acids (0.39) was almost equal to the fraction of labelled substrate
present in the supernatant (0.42 ± 0.01) indicating that nearly all the observed labels in the amino
acids originated from ethanol.

3. DISCUSSION
Microbial co-culture systems have been used for several biotechnological applications, where the
metabolic capabilities of two different organisms have been exploited. Several recent studies
have designed co-culture systems with micro-organisms that have been genetically modified to
exchange metabolites with one another. Moreover, these microbial co-cultures also serve as a
model system to study the fundamental cell-cell communication. There has been a growing
interest in studying these microbial co-cultures/communities and identifying the interactions
therein.
In this study, we systematically understand the metabolic interactions between the microorganisms in a co-culture by integrating modelling and experimental approaches. To this end, we
applied our previously developed graph-theoretic algorithm that operates on the metabolic
networks of the micro-organisms. We defined a new metric termed Metabolic Support Index
(MSI) that quantifies the support each organism receives from the other, in a community. We
computed this metric on several co-culture systems that have been experimentally studied so
far, demonstrating that this metric can correctly identify the beneficiaries in the microbial
interactions.
A few other studies incorporate the nutrient conditions and quantify the cooperation between
the organisms in a community. These studies identify the synthesising capabilities of “joint

metabolic networks” (11, 28) and identify the benefits in terms of the metabolites produced by
the individual organisms in a community. Our metric, MSI, on the other hand, determines the
number of additional reactions that can be activated in one organism due to the presence of
other, in addition to the metabolic enrichment. Furthermore, analyzing these reactions and
identifying the transporters can provide insights on targets for over-expression. These targets
can be used to improve the cooperativity between the organisms.
Further, to integrate the predictions with the experiments, we calculated MSI for a well-known
yeast co-culture system consisting of P. stipitis and S. cerevisiae and identified that P. stipitis, with
a higher MSI, benefits in this interaction. Moreover, we also identified the pathways spanning
the two organisms and identified the set of metabolites that can be exchanged between these
organisms. We also performed two-stage experiments using this co-culture and found that: (a)
P. stipitis benefits the interaction, as shown by a higher value of MSI compared to that of S.
cerevisiae and (b) P. stipitis consumes the ethanol produced by S. cerevisiae. Also, from the
labelling studies, it is also interesting to note the complete absence of m1 isotopomer in all the
amino acids analysed.
Our deconvoluted two-stage experiment is a simple methodology to establish a proof-of-concept
for identifying the microbial interactions in a community. Indeed, the dynamics of the organisms
in the co-culture may be different from that observed when the organisms are independently
cultivated on the cell-free supernatants. However, deciphering the co-culture dynamics would
entail the use of advanced molecular biological techniques. Moreover, isotope labelling patterns
of the individual organisms from the co-culture experiments are difficult to obtain. Although
recent studies seek to identify labelling patterns in co-culture, these methods either require
extraction of a large number of peptides (29) or are restricted to a co-culture of organisms with
identical biomass composition (30).
In addition, our computational method to determine the relationship between the organisms in
a co-culture, captures only the positive interactions between the organisms, as with other graphbased method based on network expansion (11). Weighting the pathways based on their
importance could help in further improving the power of MSI to predict interactions.
In sum, our study provides a systematic methodology to understand the interactions in a
microbial community by integrating computational and experimental paradigms. We believe that
such a model-integrated approach would provide us a better understanding of the intricate
metabolic interactions happening between the organisms in a community. Our study also
underlines the utility of computational analyses to generate testable hypotheses regarding the
interactions between various microbes. This generic framework can be extrapolated to study the
metabolic interactions in many microbial communities. Overall, our integrated approach can
pave the way for rationally designing and engineering microbial consortia tailored towards
specific industrial applications.

4. MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1 Computational Analyses
4.1.1 In silico calculation of MSI to identify the benefits derived by the organisms
To quantify the benefits derived by the organisms in a community, we define a metric termed Metabolic
support index (MSI). For this, we used our previously developed algorithm MetQuest (20) to determine
the number of reactions that can be visited or stuck, depending on the presence of precursor metabolites.
As defined previously, stuck reactions are those reactions whose precursor metabolites cannot be
synthesised by the metabolic network using the given input conditions, while visited reactions indicate
those reactions whose input metabolites are present and hence the reaction can proceed. We define MSI
as the fraction of blocked/stuck reactions relieved in organism A by the presence of another organism B
(Figure 1), i.e.,
𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥, 𝑀𝑆𝐼(𝐴|𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) = 1 −

𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑐𝑘,𝐴|𝐴∪𝐵
𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑐𝑘,𝐴|𝐴

(1)

where 𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑐𝑘,𝐴 denotes the number of reactions that are stuck in the (bi-partite) metabolic network
corresponding to organism A,
𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑐𝑘,𝐴∪𝐵 denotes the number of reactions that are stuck in the bi-partite metabolic network
corresponding to the community metabolic network of A and B, and
𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 denotes the community metabolic network comprising both organisms A and B
𝑀𝑆𝐼(𝐴|𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) = 1 indicates that organism A fully benefits in the interaction with organism B
𝑀𝑆𝐼(𝐴|𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) = 0 indicates that organism A does not derive any benefit from the interaction with
organism B
To calculate MSI for a micro-organism, we first constructed the directed bipartite graph of the individual
organism, followed by the joint bipartite graphs of combination of organisms from their respective
genome-scale metabolic models using the construct_graph module in MetQuest python package.
Depending on the availability of the genome-scale models of the organisms, we obtained them either
from the respective publications (31–35) or from the Path2Models database (36). We applied our
algorithm using a set of starting seed metabolites, which included the cofactors, coenzymes and the
carbon source used in the respective experiments (see Supplementary dataset). For our co-culture of
interest, i.e., S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis, the seed metabolite set consisted of components from YNB
minimal medium, D-glucose as the carbon source along with the set of cofactors and coenzymes.
Next, using the guided_bfs module in the MetQuest package, we obtained the number of “stuck”
reactions from two different scenarios: (a) when the organisms are analysed independently as “single”
graphs (𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑐𝑘,𝐴|𝐴 ), (b) when they are grown along with other organisms as a “joint” graph (𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑐𝑘,𝐴|𝐴∪𝐵 ).
Using the equation (1), we calculate the MSI of the organisms. In addition, in both the cases, we also
obtained the scope, i.e., the set of metabolites that can be produced from the given set of seed
metabolites. All the simulations were carried out in Python 3.6 on an Intel Core i7-2600 Desktop with
24GB RAM, running Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS. The scripts and the data used in this analysis are available in the
supplementary dataset.
4.1.2 Pathway analysis on S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis joint metabolic network
To identify the metabolic exchanges happening between S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis, we first enumerated
all the pathways till the length 75 using the find_pathways function in MetQuest package. We constructed
the joint bipartite graph of S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis from their respective genome-scale metabolic
models (33, 35) using the construct_graph module in MetQuest python package. We used the

components of YNB medium as seed metabolites along with D-glucose as the carbon source. Using homegrown Python scripts, we analysed every pathway from S. cerevisiae that lead to every scope metabolite
in P. stipitis for the presence of metabolites from S. cerevisiae. We carried out these simulations on an
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4850 v4 @ 2.10GHz workstation with 1TB RAM, running CentOS 7.5.1804. The
scripts and the data used in these analyses are available in the supplementary dataset.

4.2 Experimental verifications of the predicted metabolic interactions between S. cerevisiae and
P. stipitis
4.2.1 Yeast strains used
In this study, we used S. cerevisiae (MTCC No. 171) and P. stipitis (NCIM No. 3497), procured from
Microbial Type Culture Collection, Chandigarh, India and National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms,
Pune respectively.
4.2.2 Culture maintenance and inoculum preparation
The yeast strains were independently maintained on YPD agar consisting of 3 g/L Yeast extract, 10 g/L
Peptone, 20 g/L Glucose and 1% agar (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt Ltd, Mumbai, India). From the agar plate,
one colony was picked and inoculated in YPD medium and grown at 30°C. For the long-term storage,
cultures from mid-log phase were collected and maintained as 30% (v/v) glycerol stocks and stored at 80°C.
Glycerol stocks of the respective yeast strains were revived by streaking onto a YPD Agar plate and
incubating at 30°C for 24 h. The primary cultures were initiated as suspension cultures by inoculating
single colony on YPD medium, followed by YNB minimal medium without amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich,
Germany) supplemented with 10 g/L glucose (Carl Roth GmBH, Germany). The culture was grown in
minimal medium till mid-logarithmic phase and used for subsequent experiments. All the experiments
were carried out in YNB minimal medium using glucose (Carl Roth GmBH, Germany) as the carbon source.
4.2.3 Growth kinetics of mono- and co-culture
To determine the substrate utilization and product secretion profiles, growth kinetic experiments of both
the yeast strains, S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis were carried out. The culture from the well-grown primary
inoculum was inoculated in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks consisting of 25 mL of YNB medium with 10 g/L
Glucose. For all the experiments, we maintained the starting Optical Density (OD) as 0.17. The experiment
was carried out at 300 rpm, 30°C and the growth was continuously monitored online using Cell Growth
Quantifier (Aquila Biolabs GmBH). Samples were withdrawn at regular intervals for analyzing the spent
metabolites through High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).
4.2.4 Growth analysis in the spent medium for checking metabolic interactions
We designed a two-step shake flask experiment to determine if there were any interactions between the
organisms. Briefly, in the first stage, S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis were independently grown in minimal YNB
medium with 10 g/L Glucose. The growth was continuously monitored online using Cell Growth Quantifier
(CGQ) (Aquila Biolabs GmBH), and the samples were withdrawn at the start of the experiment, early and
late exponential phase. CGQ measures the backscattered light emitted by the growing microbial cells.
Data analysis, processing and visualisation, were carried out using CGQuant software version 7.3 (Aquila
Biolabs GmBH).
Samples were analysed in HPLC to check if the carbon source was completely depleted. At this stage, the
cells were separated from the broth by centrifuging at 8000 rpm, 4°C for 10 minutes and the supernatant
was filter sterilised. In the next step, to these supernatants, YNB medium and 5 g/L glucose were added.
The working volume was 20 mL. We designated the spent medium obtained from S. cerevisiae and P.

stipitis as SupSce and SupPst respectively. We inoculated these supernatants with either of these
organisms, i.e., to the SupSce we inoculated P. stipitis and to the SupPst we inoculated S. cerevisiae, such
that the initial Optical Density was 0.17 ± 0.1. We continuously monitored the growth of the organisms
using CGQ and analysed the samples for residual carbon source and the extracellular metabolites using
HPLC at the start and end of experiments. Also, we compared the growth of the organisms with that in
the control, where the supernatant was replaced with sterile distilled water. The experimental scheme is
as shown in Figure 2.
To check for the metabolic interactions, we repeated the same two-stage experiments as above, with a
single modification. Instead of naturally labelled glucose, we used 100% uniformly labelled (U-13C) glucose
as the carbon source in the first step to cultivate the micro-organisms individually. Samples withdrawn
were analyzed through HPLC for the residual carbon and the extracellular metabolites. The biomass at the
end of 24 h was analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the labelling
patterns of the amino acids alanine, valine, serine and aspartate.
4.2.5 Analytical methods
4.2.5.1 Quantification of glucose and other by-products
The substrate and the by-product analytes from the sample were estimated using High Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (System Gold125 Solvent Module, Beckman Coulter, USA) with an Organic
acid stationary phase (300 x 8 mm, 10µm particle size) (CS Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe,
Germany) under the following conditions: Mobile phase - 5 mM Sulfuric acid, Flow rate - 0.5 mL/min,
Column Temperature - 50 °C using a Refractive Index Detector (Company). Standard plots (with R2 = 0.98)
for the metabolites ethanol (Carl Roth GmbH, Germany) (0.25 – 2 % (v/v)) and glucose (2-15 g/L) were
prepared by injecting known quantities and measuring the area under the respective peaks
(Supplementary Figures S3, S4).
4.2.5.2 GC-MS to identify labelling patterns in biomass and identify the metabolites that have been
exchanged
To identify the labelling patterns in the biomass, we adapted the protocol from (37). Briefly, 0.3-0.4 mg of
the biomass pellets were resuspended in 150 µL 6M Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and transferred to 1.5 mL
glass vials (Part No AR0-3940-12 phenomenex). The suspension was incubated at 105°C for 6 hours for
hydrolysis, and dried overnight at 85°C. To the dried hydrolysate, 30µL acetonitrile and 30µL N-methyl-Ntert-butyldimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MBDSTFA) was added and incubated at 85°C for 1 h. The
samples were cooled and immediately analysed using a GC-MS single quadrupole system using the ‘Full
scan’ mode. The system consisted of a TRACE™ GC Ultra, an ISQ single quadrupole MS with electron
impact ionisation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and a ThermoScientific TriPlus RSH
Autosampler. The separation of the amino acids was achieved using TraceGOLD TG-5SilMS fused silica
column (length 15 m; inner diameter 0.25 mm; film thickness 0.25 µm). The injector temperature was set
at 270°C, and the column oven was set at 140°C for 1 minute, and the temperature was steadily increased
to 310°C with a ramp of 10°C/min, with a hold time of 1 minute. The equipment was operated under a
steady gas flow of 1 mL/min of Helium with a split ratio of 1/15. For every measurement, 1 µL of the
sample was injected. The resulting chromatogram and the mass spectra of the samples were analysed by
comparing with those of amino acids standards (Sigma Aldrich, Germany). All the mass spectra and the
chromatograms were analysed out on Thermo XCalibur 2.2 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA).
4.2.5.3 In silico methods to identify the isotopomer distribution in amino acids
From the chromatogram and the mass spectra, the peaks were identified by comparing the retention
times of different amino acids with that of standards. The mass spectrum of each derivatised amino acid

was also compared against the NIST Library using NIST MS Search software
(https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-standard-reference-database-1a-v17) to confirm the presence of
corresponding amino acid. Also, we determined the average carbon labelling and the relative abundance
of every fragment after performing corrections for proton gain and original biomass using iMS2Flux
software (Poskar et al., 2012). For all our calculations, we used the (M-57) fragment of the amino acids
for analysis.

TABLES
Table 1 : Metabolic support index to quantify pairwise interactions – This table shows the MSI
of two organisms calculated for different pairs of organisms that have been experimentally
studied. The two organisms in a co-culture are marked Organism A and Organism B for ease of
representation. Higher the value of MSI, better is the benefit the organism derives through this
interaction. The references in Column 2 and 3 represent the source of the genome-scale
metabolic model. The references in Column 6 represent the experimental studies where the cocultures of organisms have been studied. We observe that amongst every pair of organisms, the
organisms in Column 2 derive higher benefit (shown in boldface font), in agreement with
previously reported experiments (Column 6).
