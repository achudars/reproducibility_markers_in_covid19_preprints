Abstract
Radiocarbon dating Pacific archaeological sites is fraught with difficulties. Often situated in
coastal beach ridges or sand dunes, sites exhibit horizontal and vertical disturbances, while datable
materials such as wood charcoal are typically highly degraded, or derived from old trees or drift
wood and bone collagen rarely survives in the tropical conditions. Shell, therefore, is the most
logical material for dating Pacific sites since it is resistant to alteration, can be sampled to ensure
only the last few seasons of growth are represented and is often closely tied to human economic
activities. However, shell radiocarbon (14C) dating has been plagued by interpretive problems
largely due to our limited knowledge of the

14C

cycle in near shore marine and estuarine

environments. Consequently, shell dates are typically ignored in regional chronometric evaluations

and often avoided for dating altogether. Recent advances in our understanding of the source of
shell 14C content as well as the development of the first South Pacific Gyre model of changing
marine 14C over time, combined with Bayesian statistical modelling, have now provided us with
insight into the value of these shell radiocarbon dates, enabling a revision of the age of the To’aga
site on Ofu Island, an early occupation site associated with the initial Polynesian Plainware period
in Samoa, the earliest use of which is now dated to between 2782 and 2667 cal BP.

Introduction
The Lapita cultural complex, of which dentate-stamped pottery is a defining component, is argued
to have begun in the Bismarck Archipelago around 3350 years ago. From there it spread into
previously uninhabited areas of Remote Oceania (Fig 1), reaching its eastern-most extent in the
Tongan and Samoan archipelagos around 2900-2750 BP [1][2][3]. The timing of first landfall on
each island group by these Lapita explorers has been the subject of a number of chronological
evaluations (e.g., [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]) but several parts of this story remain controversial.
Of note are debates over the timing of the transition from dentate-stamped Lapita ceramics to
undecorated ceramics (termed Polynesian Plainware [PPW]) - a significant change in material
culture that is considered to mark the onset of Ancestral Polynesian society [12].

There is no doubt that Lapita colonizers reached the island of 'Upolu in Western Samoa, where the
submerged coastal site of Mulifanua (SU-17-1) contains classic dentate-stamped Lapita ceramics

of local manufacture [13][14]. The exact date of this settlement remains somewhat problematic
because the material was obtained by dredging during the construction of a ferry terminal [15].
Radiocarbon dates (here reported at 68% probability) obtained on material collected from the
dredging spoils produced a date on turtle bone and shell of 2880-2750 cal BP [16]. Comparably
early charcoal dates have also been obtained from the sites of ‘Aoa (AS-21-5) on Tutuila Island,
and To‘aga (AS-13-1) on Ofu Island in the Manu'a group. Dates from these sites suggested that
occupation either pre-dated, or was contemporaneous with, Mulifanua [17][18][19], but neither
'Aoa or To'aga produced ceramics with dentate stamped decoration. Instead, red- and orangeslipped thin, fine tempered plainware was recovered from the deepest units of both sites. These
ceramics were considered to represent a distinct marker horizon between the earliest layers and
those that contained thicker, coarse-tempered pottery which became dominant after 2400 cal BP
([20] pg 91).
Rieth and Hunt [21] evaluated all available 14C dates from the Samoan archipelago. Their
analysis “challenged the validity of the earliest dates from ‘Aoa and To‘aga” because of their low
precision (standard errors in excess of ±100 years). This left only shell dates from To’aga for
consideration, suggesting a ~300 year separation between the ceramics from Mulifanua and the
earliest occupations at To‘aga (2500-2400 cal BP), and two other early sites at Utumea (Tutuila
Island; 2500-2100 cal BP; AS-22-44) and Jane’s Camp (Upolu; 2300-2000 cal BP; SU-18-1, SUF1-1). Addison and Morrison ([22] pg 363) subsequently concluded that the limitations of current
radiocarbon technology and calibration methods, combined with the problems of stratification and
mixing of sandy Pacific coastal sites, meant that further refinement of the absolute chronology for
early Samoa was unlikely.

This post-2500 BP “re-colonization” date was questioned by Clark et al. [23] who
presented new data from three PPW sites on the island of Ofu: Va’oto (AS-13-13), Coconut Grove
(AS-13-37) and Ofu Village (AS-13-41). Combining these results in a single-phase Bayesian
model populated by a combination of short-lived Cocos nucifera endocarp charcoal and highly
precise U/Th coral dates, Clark et al ([23] pg 272) concluded that initial settlement of Ofu Island
occurred between 2717 and 2663 cal BP. This date overlapped with modelled dates for the end of
Lapita from sites on Tongatapu, Ha’apai, and Vava’u (2703-2683 cal BP) where a chronological
progression from Lapita to PPW sites had been identified [24], suggesting settlement of Ofu soon
after the loss of Lapita ceramics in Tonga. The question of whether the Lapita-PPW transition in
Samoa represented two discrete settlement events, or a single transitional event, remained
unresolved.
While new data using both

14C

and new dating techniques (U/Th), combined with re-

evaluation of existing data, provide great promise for resolving many chronological issues in the
Pacific, the avoidance of key dating materials and the use of single-phase Bayesian evaluations
unconstrained by stratigraphy or other form of independent dating control, effectively leave us
with an imprecise chronology that is smeared over many decades. Ultimately, we are still left with
an inability to truly resolve important chronological questions: 1. When was the earliest
occupation? 2. How fast did people spread? 3. Was settlement continuous? 4. From what direction
did settlement spread?
In this paper, we address some of these issues by presenting a re-investigation of the
chronology of the To’aga site using a suite of new and precise shell and bone AMS 14C dates taken
from key contexts. Based on these new 14C results, we evaluate the placement of To’aga within

Tonga.

The To’aga excavation and radiocarbon dates
The To’aga site (AS-13-1), situated on the southern coast of Ofu Island, was first test excavated
in 1986 with more extensive excavations being undertaken in 1987 and 1989 [19]. The site consists
of stratified cultural deposits situated within a coastal beach terrace located on the southern side
of Ofu Island. The terrace was archaeologically investigated primarily through the excavation of
1-m2 test pits arrayed along a series of six transects running perpendicular to the coast (Fig 2).
These transects revealed buried cultural deposits, some of which contained PPW ceramics, shell
fishhooks, ornaments, and other artefacts and associated faunal remains. During the 1987 field
season, an expanded trench was opened up to further sample the deeply buried, ceramic-bearing
deposits, and is referred to below as the "Main Excavation". The original suite of radiocarbon dates
from all three excavation seasons are presented in Kirch [20].

conducted in 1986, 1987, and 1989 (from [25] fig 5.8).

For this renewed chronological evaluation, samples were sourced from excavated materials
curated in the Oceanic Archaeology Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. These
samples were specifically chosen to aid in defining the age of the oldest two main occupation
deposits. They come from four locations; Unit 9 of the Main Excavation, Unit 10 located 45m to
the southwest of the Main Excavation, Unit 28 located on Transect 5 to the east of the Main

Original dates: The principal pottery-bearing layer in the Main Excavation is Layer IIB ([19]
pg 51, fig. 5.5). This is capped by the culturally sterile Layer IIA, with a thin zone on top (IIA-1)
that contained scattered shell and coarse-tempered sherds interpreted to be eroded material that
accumulated following the abandonment of occupation in this area. Two dates on Turbo setosus
shell from Layer IIB gave equivalent results (Beta-25033; 2311-2094 cal BP, and Beta-25034;
2244-2007 cal BP). Towards the base of Layer IIC large coral and volcanic rubble was interpreted
as being the result of high energy deposition, most likely a storm event. Small numbers of thin,
fine-tempered sherds were found in Layer IIC (a sandy, beach-ridge deposit) and in Layer III
(massive colluvium derived from erosion up-slope); neither Layer IIC nor III were considered to
represent in-situ occupations, and the sherds in them were interpreted as coming from the slope
inland of the site. Layer IV was culturally sterile, and although two thin, fine-tempered sherds
were recovered from Layer V these were also interpreted as having derived from an occupation
locality further inland, now buried by colluvium and not accessible through hand excavation ([19]
pg 51, 56). A date on a mixture of different shell taxa (Beta-25035; 3714-3549 cal BP) was
obtained from lower Layer V, and a second date from nearby Unit 1 (Beta-25673; 3475-3326 cal
BP) ([20] pg 91), but both results are considered to derive from secondary deposition. The Unit 10
excavation exposed a stratigraphic sequence very similar to that of the Main Excavation, with
Layer IIB considered to be identical to Layer IIB in the Main Excavation units (dated by wood
charcoal sample Beta-26464; 2916-2403 cal BP) ([20] pg 53-54).

New dates: An additional four samples from the main cultural deposits (Layer IIB) in Units 9
and 10 were selected for dating; two dates on echinoid spines (Wk-45468 and Wk-45472), one on
Rattus exulans bone (Wk-45469), and one on Turbo setosus shell (Wk-46708).

Transect 5, Unit 28
Original dates: Transect 5 lay approximately 100m east of the Main Excavation ([19] fig. 5.5).
Unit 28 was placed at the base of a steep talus slope, and was specifically excavated to trace a
deeply-buried cultural deposit exposed in Unit 15 (10m to the south of Unit 28) that contained a
few sherds of thin, orange-slipped ceramics. Because the colluvial slope rises steeply along this
inland edge of the coastal terrace, the excavation of Unit 28 required removal of 2.4m of colluvium
and large boulders. Beneath the massive colluvium, the main cultural deposit (Layer II, with
subcomponents IIB and IIC) contained ceramics and other artefacts and faunal material. Of 103
potsherds recovered from Layer IIC, 49 percent were fine, thin-wares. A single charcoal

14C

sample from the base of Layer II (Beta-25601; 3257-2879 cal BP) was considered to date in-situ
cultural material. Because of the steeply rising colluvial slope inland of Unit 28, further
excavations to the north were not possible, but it was thought likely that older deposits remained
unexcavated in that direction ([19] pg 60, 67).

New dates: Two dates, from the same context as Beta-25601 (Transect 5, Unit 28), were
obtained to confirm the age of Layer IIB; a date on echinoid spine (Wk-45473) and a date on Turbo
setosus shell (Wk-46707).

Transect 9, Units 20/23
Original dates: As with Unit 28, Units 20/23 were also located at the base of the talus slope,
but about 400 m east of the Main Excavation. Layer IIIA was associated with a large earth oven

feature, dug down into Layer IIIB, containing large numbers of sea urchin spines (Heterocentrotus
mammillatus), from which a charcoal 14C sample (Beta-35602; 2845-2612 cal BP) was originally
dated. The underlying Layer IIIB was a thick, organic midden deposit that thinned into Layer IIIC
([19] pg 74, fig 5.22). Two charcoal dates (Beta-35603 and Beta-35602) from Unit 23, Layer III,
returned ages of 2917-2382 cal BP and 2845-2612 cal BP respectively; significantly different from
a shell date (Beta-35604; Tridacna maxima) from Layer IIIB (2444-2289 cal BP).

New dates: Four new dates were obtained from Unit 23; one on an echinoid spine (Wk-45470)
and one on Rattus exulans bone (Wk-45471). Both came from the same context as the previous
charcoal and Tridacna date (i.e., Layer IIB). Two additional dates, one on an echinoid spine (Wk47458) and one on Turbo sp. shell (Wk-47459) from Layer IIIC were dated to provide a maximum
age for this part of the site.

Comment on Dates
Charcoal
Short-lived nut charcoal samples with only 1 year of growth are considered to be one of the most
reliable dating materials, assuming there has been minimal stratigraphic displacement. It is also
well-established that most wood charcoal determinations will date earlier than the event by an
unknown amount [26]. This could be by a few years, or several hundred years, but Pacific research
has indicated that, except in the highest precision analyses, minor inbuilt age typically goes
unnoticed [27][28]. A large number of extant radiocarbon dates from Pacific contexts are on
charcoal that has not been identified to short-lived materials, and removal of these unidentified
charcoal dates from chronological evaluations would result in a dataset composed of relatively few

dates. It has been demonstrated in Bayesian models that a small dataset has a greater detrimental
impact on chronological resolution than the potential of unidentified charcoals to skew to older
ages [29]. Outlier analysis specifically designed to account for this inbuilt age in charcoal is
promising [5][29], but requires additional constraints (e.g., dates on short-lived materials or
stratigraphy) against which to anchor the model (see also [30] where the model allows a small
number of charcoal samples with inbuilt age to be younger than the context they represent, as
would be the case with intrusive material).

Bone
Rattus exulans (Pacific rat) have a notoriety stemming from anomalously early dates from New
Zealand archaeological contexts [31]. A range of theories have been put forward for these dates
including the small size of these bones and potential laboratory contamination at the time of dating
[32][33]. Twenty years later, there have been improvements in our understanding of dietary offsets
and application of (dietary and reservoir) corrections to a range of animals that feed in both marine
and terrestrial environments [34][9][35][36][37], as well as significant improvements in sample
pretreatment and the abilities of AMS dating technology to date these tiny samples [38]. The
importance of rats as human commensals, as evidenced by their presence in many archaeological
deposits including To’aga ([19] pg 200, table 13.3), means there is significant benefit from being
able to date these animals directly [39]. They do however, require a dietary correction which can
be calculated from 15N and 13C analysis of the bone collagen and/or 13C of bone carbonate [8].
We are not aware of any rat specific 14C studies into dietary corrections for island environments,
but evaluation of 14C dates of other omnivorous animals (i.e., humans, pigs and chickens) from
Pacific contexts [9][34] suggests a similar correction methodology is required.

Marine Shell
Marine shells that were gathered for food precisely date the timing of this activity. However, shell
radiocarbon dates remain problematic because of uncertainties over 14C reservoir offsets (the R
value). This has resulted in many Pacific Island chronologies being dominated by wood and
charcoal (e.g., [7][40][24][41][23]. See however, [5][21][42]). Petchey et al. [43] demonstrated
little regional variation within the central Pacific Gyre zone, calculating an average R value of
6±21 14C years for modern shell collected from regions where currents are not interrupted by major
island chains (e.g., Solomon Islands) or by contact between water bodies (e.g., Southland
Front/Subtropical Front).
Subsequent research has demonstrated that shells, in particular, may give apparently
erroneous 14C results depending on genera and even species selected, as well as local near shore
conditions, unless appropriate corrections are applied. Within the South Pacific Gyre region one
major concern when dating molluscs is the presence of ancient limestone on many islands [44],
which can be taken up by animals either by directly living in waters that have percolated through
the limestone, or directly by grazing on the rock [45][42]. Although Turbo and Trochus are
potentially problematic in this respect ([46][47][48]) and sea urchins (echinoids) could similarly
be affected due to their scavenging behaviour [49], the volcanic geology of Ofu Island negates any
problems of this nature [50].
More recently it has become apparent that R values have not remained stable over the last
3000 years; shifts in marine

14C

between 3000- and 1900-years ago have been documented in

corals from the eastern coastline of Australia that are linked to changes in ocean circulation
[51][52]. These R changes have also been documented in archaeological shell specimens from

the central South Pacific Gyre region. Consequently, modern validation studies and reservoir
correction values may not be applicable to archaeological material. Previously reported
archaeological paired shell/charcoal R values for Samoa (e.g., [53][20]) are excluded from this
calculation because the paired charcoals selected for dating were not identified to short-lived
materials. R values obtained from U/Th dated corals from Ofu Island, reported in Clark et al.
(2016), support these observations (Fig 4). The R values available for the period between 3100
and 2650 BP have a pooled value of -47±10 14C years (210:0.05 = 33.33<18.31: GSD = 76). Between
2650 and 2250 BP the value drops to -161±11

14C

years (28:0.05 = 13.29<15.51: GSD = 47).

Unfortunately, this change occurs at a critical time for To’aga and the Lapita/PPW transition, and
necessitates our testing both values.

Calibration
All radiocarbon dates were calibrated using OxCal v4.3.2 [54] with the Marine13 and Intcal13
curves [55]. We calibrated the shell results using either a R of -47±76 14C years or -161±47 14C
years. We have used the Northern Hemisphere 14C calibration curve (Intcal13) due to the position
of Ofu within the Sub-Tropical Convergence Zone (after [56]), though a mixture of the Southern
and Northern Hemisphere calibration curves is likely to be more appropriate (cf. [57]), but cannot
currently be evaluated.

Rattus exulans bone dates require a dietary correction to the raw

14C

data to obtain

calibrated ages). A percent marine carbon (%MarineC, in this instance 28%) contribution to the
diet was calculated for Wk-45469 which had a measured 13C value of -17.8‰. A similar
correction was assumed for Wk-45471 which was too small for both

14C

and 13C analysis.

Following the methodology outlined in Petchey et al. [58] both dates were calibrated with a
corresponding mixture of the Intcal13 and Marine13 14C curves. The radiocarbon determinations,
stable isotope values and calibrations, after the application of the resulting reservoir and dietary
effects, can be found in Table 1. Dates are reported at 68% probability throughout the text.

Bayesian analysis
To provide the most probable chronology for To’aga, we conducted a Bayesian Sequence Analysis
using OxCal 4.3.2 whereby radiocarbon ages are ordered on the basis of stratigraphic evidence
[59]. In this model we have grouped the dates into two phases; Early (Transect 9, Unit 23 and
Transect 5, Unit 28) and Main Excavation Layer (Units 6, 9 and 10) separated by a contiguous
boundary. Within this “Early” phase, Unit 23 is further divided into three phases within a separate
sequence that overlaps with the dates from Unit 28.
To assess the likelihood of any one sample being an outlier, a General t-type Outlier Model
is inset into the sequence [60]. This enables outliers to be either too young or too old, and downweights their influence in the model [26]. These dates are assigned a prior outlier probability of
0.05 and the scale of the offset is allowed to range anywhere between 100 and 104 years [“U(0,4)”].
The unidentified charcoal dates with possible inbuilt age are further assessed using an outlier
correction for charcoal as described by Bronk Ramsey [26]; (Exp (1,–10,0), U(0,2.5),‘t’) whereby
the exponential distribution runs from -10 to 0 with a time-constant of 1, ensuring outliers can only

be older. The shifts are then scaled by a common scaling factor that can lie anywhere between 100
and 102.5 years. The impact of outliers on the model can be assessed by convergence values
generated (S2-4). These should be >95%. Lower values indicate many different incompatible
solutions to the model at these points. In Fig 5, calibrated ages before the model parameters have
been applied (“prior probability values”) are shown as unfilled outlines. Posterior probability
values after the model has been applied are shown in black.

Results
There are differences in modelled age depending on whether a R value of -47±76 or -161±47 14C
years has been used (Table 2 and S2 Tables). While these results do not conclusively support an
age for the earliest deposits prior to 2650 cal BP, and therefore the suitability of using a R of 47±76 14C years, they do give strong support to this conclusion; use of the -161±47 14C years R
value for the period 2650 - 2250 cal BP results in an even earlier date for the site (between 28172740 cal BP), which would then negate the use of this R value. The slightly later deposits in
Layer IIB in the Main Excavation are, however, likely to date to after 2650 cal BP, in which case a
R of -161±47 14C years may be required for these layers. However, the Main Excavation Layer
IIA-C deposits almost certainly include a mixture of early and later material based on the ceramic
evidence (i.e., the proportions of thin-ware versus thick-ware). This caveat aside, we favour a third
model where both R values are applied depending on an early or late designation (Fig 5 and S
4). This produces a date for the initial settlement of To’aga of between 2782 and 2667 cal BP.

Discussion
This multiphase sequence and outlier analysis provides the most secure age for the earliest deposits
at To’aga available so far, and places first use of the site between 2782-2667 cal BP. This earliest
phase of activity continues until 2613 cal BP (represented by boundary “Transition” in Table 2 and Fig 5).
Subsequent activities in the Main Excavation take place between 2727 and 2104 cal BP (boundaries
“Transition” and “End”), possibly incorporating material from many phases of activity that have become
mixed together as a result of continual activity in the same general location. How do these new ages

compare to the chronology of Lapita and PPW in Samoa and Tonga and is it possible to shed any
further light on the key chronological questions for the region: when was the earliest occupation;

how fast did people spread; was settlement continuous; and from what direction did settlement
spread? In an attempt to answer these questions, and to highlight discrepancies in our current
knowledge of regional chronology and radiocarbon methodology, the following regional
comparison has been undertaken.
To ensure consistency across the datasets we have recalibrated the dates reported by Burley
et al. [10] using the Intcal13 calibration curve. The original Tongan chronology presented by
Burley et al. ([10][41]) uses the Southern Hemisphere terrestrial calibration curve [61]. Clark et
al. [23] uses the Northern Hemisphere curve (Intcal13). The average difference between the two
curves up to 1000 BP is 41±14 14C years. We added the 16 new PPW dates reported by Burley et
al. (2018), and while we have duplicated the overlapping phase Bayesian analysis used in the 2015
study we have also added outlier analysis to the OxCal code; specifying either General t-type
Outlier for short-lived material or a Charcoal Outlier in situations where the charcoal has not
positively been identified to short-lived material. Similarly, we have rerun the single-phase
chronology based on short-lived materials presented in Clark et al. [62], again with outlier analysis,
but excluding all To’aga dates. The Ofu PPW model includes relatively few dates (n=13) and is
therefore at risk of being heavily biased by sampling and material choice. In particular, highly
precise U/Th dates while providing a terminus post quem for the formation of the earliest cultural
layers, are not definitively associated with cultural activity and are likely to have been deposited
prior to first site use (For example, 2014-19 came from the boundary of the lowest cultural layer
and the paleo beach ([62] pg 269). Consequently, in our revision of the Ofu PPW chronology we
have only used coral that has been culturally modified. We have also applied a General t-type
outlier to the U/Th dates to highlight that any date on this material dates the age of coral growth,
not necessarily the age of the cultural modification (code for the Tongan Lapita, PPW and Samoan

PPW sites is given in S 5). Lastly, the age of the Mulifanua turtle bone (NZA-4780; 3062 ± 66
BP) has been recalibrated using a R of -47±76 14C years.
Fig 6 shows several important differences between the old regional chronology (6a) and
proposed new chronology (6b). The slightly increased age range for the three Tongan island groups
during the Lapita phase is largely because of the large number of unidentified charcoal samples
down-weighted by the outlier analysis. The slight shift to older ages, most obvious in the Tongan
Lapita phase, is a consequence of using the Intcal13 curve. Now the earliest possible age for the
Tongan PPW sites based on a single-phase analysis of all 45 Tongan PPW dates is 2744 cal BP.
This refinement to the PPW sequence is the result of the increased number of dates now available
and indicates the importance of larger numbers of dates when undertaking single-phase analyses
of this type [29]. The duration of the Ofu PPW phase has been reduced by the removal of the
culturally-unmodified coral U/Th dates (specifically 2014-19).

The age for the Mulifanua Lapita site is now based on a single bone date rather than a
pooled result, as calculated by Petchey (2001), and has shifted to a slightly older age range in
response to the use of the -47±76 14C year R value as opposed to a R of 57±23 14C years used
in Petchey (2001). Unfortunately, this date was produced over 20 years ago, and the available
quality control information indicate that it would not pass the current bone assessment protocols
essential for 14C dating (S 1). It should therefore be considered a minimum age.

Directionality, Continuity and Speed.
Burley et al. [24] argued for directionality with Lapita settlement moving from Tongatapu, where
there was a short hiatus of ca. 70-90 years, before continued expansion through Ha'apai with near
simultaneous movement into the Vava’u group; a maximum span of 158 years of Lapita settlement
in Tonga. Our new model expands this to 243 years because of the additional uncertainty built into
our outlier model. Regardless, U/Th dates from Tongatapu and Vava’u remain key indicators of
the Lapita temporal limits. Lapita settlement of the remote northern islands of Niuatoputapu and
Samoa were extensions of this movement ([24] pg 11). This argument implies initial Lapita
colonization probably avoided northern Tonga and Samoa, but is difficult to reconcile given
artefactual evidence of early connectivity between Fiji and Samoa [14][63]. Given the similarity
in age of Mulifanua to early Lapita sites on Tongatapu our new model indicates that contact with
'Upolu most likely occurred early in the sequence, predating later Lapita settlements in Ha’pai and
Vava’u, thus reopening the possibility of early movement via a northern corridor through Futuna
and ‘Uvea [64][65]. This conclusion is tenuous, however, and necessitates further investigation of
the antiquity of Mulifanua and these remote island outliers.

In the model presented by Burley et al. [24], the change to PPW occurred across the Tongan
archipelago at a similar time. Our revised model is not currently precise enough to confirm that
the transition to PPW occurred post-Lapita in Tonga, but it does support the conclusion of Burley
et al. [24] that change was very rapid and near-simultaneous. The refined age for To’aga, and the
likelihood that the current age range for the Lapita site at Mulifanua is a minimum age, suggests
there may be a time lapse between these two early Samoan sites, but the exact magnitude is
uncertain. Consequently, we cannot rule out abandonment of the Samoan islands for a short period
before resettlement after a more secure base had been established in Tonga or elsewhere, but the
gap identified by Rieth et al. [66] and Addison and Morrison [22] is now significantly reduced and
an outright failure of Lapita colonisation of Samoa seems unlikely. Whether this possible
“resettlement” at To’aga occurred at the terminal end of Tongan Lapita, or during the subsequent
PPW phase is uncertain because the age for To’aga currently overlaps both. However, To’aga is
significantly older than any other currently known Samoan plainware sites and fills a temporal gap
between Lapita and PPW in Samoa. The continued use of To’aga from 2613 cal BP onwards (as
evidenced by the Main Excavation/Transitional boundary date [Table 2]) clearly overlaps with
activities elsewhere on Ofu Island. This continuum of human presence in Samoa has previously
been postulated by Anderson and Clark ([67] pg 415) because the distinctive Samoan plainware
ceramics would have necessitated some length of time to develop.
Even though we can refine the chronology movement through the islands using U/Th
dating, as has been done for Tongan Lapita sites, this has not been possible for To’aga, and has
not been as successful for defining PPW. In part, this is because of limited numbers of suitable
culturally modified corals from key archaeological sites. Even the corpus of 14C dates on shortlived materials from early sites is limited (see [21]). While it is difficult to give any

recommendations as to the number of dates required to improve our findings further, Schmid et al.
([29] pg 67) has suggested in such large-scale phase models ~280 dates will produce results of the
highest precision, while the most accurate results are achieved where sampling density is
uniformly distributed. Moreover, while many researchers question the usefulness of using

14C

dating especially across the “Radiocarbon Plateau” (ca. 2650-2350 cal BP) there is structure
present during this 300-year flat section of the calibration curve which could be utilised if larger
numbers of precise (±20 years or better) dates on short-lived material were obtained from secure
multiphase contexts. Clearly, more work is required across this region and time period.

Conclusions
Our new dates and re-analysis of the site chronology indicates that the best estimation of the initial
use of the To’aga site is between 2782 and 2667 cal BP. This confirms the antiquity of the site
relative to other PPW sites on Ofu Island in Samoa, but we cannot confirm or refute an overlap in
settlement timing with the Lapita site of Mulifanua on 'Upolu. Our findings also suggest that the
initial occupation at To'aga was contemporary with the terminal Lapita/PPW transition in Tonga,
but we cannot definitively say which came first. What is apparent, is that settlement in Samoa
occurred early and is likely to have continued in a near unbroken sequence since Lapita times.
Over the decades, radiocarbon dates and the interpretation of those dates have become
more sophisticated, but as research themes develop and new dating technologies become involved
in the debates it has more than ever become necessary to refine the issues – both in archaeological
research and radiocarbon methodology – that still plague the chronological interpretation.
Chronometric hygiene methodologies initially provided the means to some clarity, but
unfortunately removed a high proportion of dates from consideration. The limited number of early

sites throughout the Pacific means we cannot afford to ignore the evidence already collected and
where data are no longer considered of highest precision it is essential that extant excavations with
curated samples are revisited. Bayesian methodologies now offer new opportunities to test these
assumptions, as does refinement in 14C variation in both the marine and terrestrial reservoirs.
