Abstract:
Background: PIE12-trimer is a highly potent D-peptide HIV-1 entry inhibitor that broadly
targets group M isolates. It specifically binds the three identical conserved hydrophobic pockets
at the base of the gp41 N-trimer with sub-femtomolar affinity. This extremely high affinity for
the transiently exposed gp41 trimer provides a reserve of binding energy (resistance capacitor) to
combat resistance via stepwise accumulation of modest affinity-disrupting mutations. Viral
passaging in the presence of escalating PIE12-trimer concentrations ultimately selected for
PIE12-trimer resistant populations, but required an extremely extended timeframe (>1 year) in
comparison to other entry inhibitors. Eventually, HIV developed resistance to PIE12-trimer by
mutating Q577 in the gp41 pocket.
Results: Using deep sequence analysis, we identified three mutations at Q577 (R, N and K) in
our two PIE12-trimer resistant pools. Each point mutant is capable of conferring the majority of
PIE12-trimer resistance seen in the polyclonal pools. Surface plasmon resonance studies
demonstrated substantial affinity loss between PIE12-trimer and the Q577R-mutated gp41
pocket. A high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of PIE12 bound to the Q577R pocket revealed
the loss of two hydrogen bonds, the repositioning of neighboring residues, and a small decrease
in buried surface area. The Q577 mutations in an NL4-3 backbone decreased viral growth rates.
Fitness was ultimately rescued in resistant viral pools by a suite of compensatory mutations in
gp120 and gp41, of which we identified seven candidates from our sequencing data.
Conclusions: These data show that PIE12-trimer exhibits a high barrier to resistance, as extended
passaging was required to develop resistant virus with normal growth rates. The primary resistance
mutation, Q577R/N/K, found in the conserved gp41 pocket, substantially decreases inhibitor

Background:
Approximately 37 million people are living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
a virus that has resulted in an estimated 35 million deaths due to Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) [1]. Combination antiviral therapeutics targeting various stages of the viral
lifecycle have dramatically improved the clinical outcome for those with access to treatment, but
viral resistance has been documented for all approved drugs [2]. This resistance is due to a lowfidelity viral reverse transcriptase, frequent recombination events, rapid turnover of the virus, and
host APOBEC3 activity[3-5].
We previously reported the discovery and design of an extremely potent D-peptide HIV-1
entry inhibitor (PIE12) that targets the HIV envelope protein (Env) using sequential rounds of
mirror-image phage display and high-resolution structure-guided design [6-9]. With the opposite
chirality of naturally occurring L-peptides, D-peptides (composed of D-amino acids) are not
recognized by natural proteases. This property confers longer in vivo half-lives and reduced
immunogenicity, which are potentially significant therapeutic advantages [7]. Our inhibitor
harnesses avidity for the highly conserved trimeric pocket at the base of the HIV-1 gp41 N-trimer,
as three D-peptide monomers are covalently linked via an optimized PEG-based scaffold (PIE12trimer), and binds the N-trimer with sub-fM affinity [8, 10]. PIE12-trimer prevents the collapse of

the N-trimer and C-peptide regions of gp41 into the 6-helix bundle (trimer-of-hairpins) structure
required for membrane fusion during viral entry, and it inhibits all members of a diverse panel of
primary Group M HIV isolate strains with high pM to low nM potency (IC50) [8].
The remarkable conservation of this gp41 hydrophobic pocket target [6] is indicative of its
critical roles in the viral life cycle and impedes the ability of the virus to combat inhibitors that
target it. The region of the HIV-1 genome encoding the pocket is conserved at both the protein
level (for the role of gp41 in membrane fusion during viral entry) and nucleotide level (due to a
structured RNA region in the critical Rev-response element). The only FDA-approved HIV fusion
inhibitor, enfuvirtide (Fuzeon), is an L-peptide derived from the gp41 C-peptide region that targets
the gp41 N-trimer region adjacent to, but not including, the hydrophobic pocket and induces the
rapid emergence of gp41 resistance mutations both in vitro and in vivo [11, 12]. Next-generation
L-peptide fusion inhibitors (such as T-1249 and T-2635), whose binding footprint extends into the
pocket, are much less impacted by enfuvirtide resistance mutations. Viral escape from these
inhibitors generally takes longer to appear but still involves resistance mutations located outside
the pocket region [13-16].
In addition to targeting a highly conserved, functionally critical region of the virus, PIE12trimer was designed with an additional barrier to viral resistance called the “resistance capacitor”.
The gp41 N-trimer is transiently exposed during HIV entry in a prehairpin intermediate
conformation [17]. The potency of a variety of high-affinity prehairpin intermediate-targeting
inhibitors has been shown to vary with changes in association kinetics rather than affinity,
reflective of the kinetically limited availability of the target [8, 9, 18-20]. Once a threshold
association rate is reached, additional affinity enhancement fails to improve antiviral potency. We
chose to “over-engineer” PIE12-trimer such that its pocket-binding affinity far surpassed its

potency. This excess binding energy, or resistance capacitor, should prevent the accumulation of
incremental mutations that modestly disrupt inhibitor affinity, as such mutations would not affect
potency and would therefore fail to confer a selective replicative advantage. Instead, the virus
would be forced to combat PIE12-trimer with a strongly disruptive mutation, likely at the cost of
viral fitness.
Several lines of evidence suggested that PIE12-trimer would exhibit a high barrier to
resistance. First, PIE12-trimer is estimated to bind with sub-fM affinity and inhibit with low nM
potency, characteristic of a “highly charged” resistance capacitor [8]. Second, PIE12-trimer
exhibits higher potency against polyclonal viruses derived from infected patients than does an
earlier generation D-peptide trimer with lower affinity, demonstrating its better tolerance of Env
sequence variation. Finally, PIE12-trimer maintains potency against virus resistant to PIE7-dimer,
a lower affinity D-peptide. Indeed, consistent with a “highly charged” resistance capacitor, we
observed a significant delay in the selection of HIV-1 resistant to PIE12-trimer compared to
selections against enfuvirtide and earlier-generation D-peptides [8].
Expanding on our earlier work that selected for viral resistance to PIE12-trimer, here we
describe the biochemical, structural, and functional properties of the primary PIE12-trimer
resistance mutations (Q577R/N/K). These mutations substantially disrupt PIE12-trimer affinity
and significantly decrease viral fitness. Through comprehensive characterization of the genotype
of our PIE12-trimer resistant viral populations via next-generation sequencing, we identify
potential compensatory mutations in HIV Env that restore fitness in the context of Q577R/N/K.

PIE12-trimer resistant viruses were acquired in a previous study [8]. Briefly, CEM-1 cells
were infected with the laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain NL4-3 (obtained from Dr. Malcolm
Martin, Cat #114, NIH AIDS Reagent Program). Virus was serially propagated weekly by adding
a 1:5 dilution of cell-free viral supernatant to fresh CEM-1 cells in the presence or absence
(control) of PIE12-trimer. Viral titers were monitored biweekly by p24 antigen ELISA
(PerkinElmer). The initial inhibitor concentration was 1 nM (near the PIE12-trimer IC50). When
p24 antigen levels in PIE12-trimer-containing cultures approached the level seen in inhibitor-free
(control) cultures (typically 5-15 weeks), PIE12-trimer concentrations were raised approximately
1.5- to 2-fold. Ultimately, two polyclonal viral pools able to propagate in the presence of 320 nM
PIE12-trimer (W1 and W2) were obtained. These pools were propagated in CEM-GFP cells for
48 h then isolated and concentrated over a 20% sucrose cushion.

Cells and Viruses:
TZM-bl cells that express luciferase and β-galactosidase in response to HIV-1 promoter
activation (obtained from Dr. John C. Kappes and Dr. Xiaoyun Wu, Cat #8129, NIH AIDS Reagent
Program) and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle media. CEM-GFP cells that
express GFP in response to HIV-1 LTR activation (obtained from Dr. Jacques Corbeil, Cat #3655,
NIH AIDS Reagent Program) were grown in RPMI 1640 media. The Q577R, Q577N and Q577K
point mutant viral vectors were generated by excising the env region of the WT pNL4-3 genome
using XhoI and EcoRI (NEB) and ligating into pET20b (Novagen), a shuttle vector we used for
mutagenesis. The point mutants (CGG for Q577R, AAG for Q577K and AAC for Q577N) were
introduced using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit with primers designed using NEBuilder
software

(NEB).

Mutated clones were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and the desired mutants were ligated back
into the WT pNL4-3 backbone after EcoRI/XhoI digestion. Env in the final Q577-mutated pNL43 constructs was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. These vectors were then transfected into 293T
cells using Fugene HD (Promega) to generate replication-competent virus. Viral titers were
measured using the HIV-1 p24 Antigen Capture Assay (Advanced Bioscience Laboratories) and
confirmed by X-gal staining of infected TZM-bl cells.

Generation of envelope cDNA for Sanger and deep sequencing:
Viral RNA was isolated from the W1, W2, and control viral pools with the E.Z.N.A.®
Viral RNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek). Env cDNA was generated using the SuperScript® III One-Step
RT-PCR System with Platinum® Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen). Barcoded primers were designed

Individual plasmid clones were sequenced by the DNA Sequencing Core Facility (University of

For deep sequencing, the cDNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted
(GenElute™ Gel Extraction Kit, Sigma), and submitted to the High-Throughput Genomics and
Bioinformatic Analysis Core Facility (Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah) for library
preparation and sequencing. Barcoded samples were multiplexed in a single lane and sequenced
on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (50 cycle single-end reads). The raw sequencing reads in FASTQ
format were mapped to nucleotides 6195-8826 from the HIV-1 vector pNL4-3 sequence
(GenBank: AF324493.2) using STAMPY [22]. A summary of base calls for each position of the
reference sequence was generated by converting the alignment data to pileup format using the
SAMtools:mpileup function (used -BQ0 and -d 2000000 options). Custom Perl scripts were used
to convert base calls at each position from pileup format to a more intuitive table and then to filter
the data to display only those positions where deviations from the reference are present in the
population above a user-defined threshold (10%).

Peptide Synthesis:
All synthetic peptides were acetylated at the N-terminus and amidated at the C-terminus.
All reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) purifications were performed on a Waters C18 column (BEH
X-Bridge, 19 x 250 mm, 10 µm, 300 Å) with water/acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% TFA unless
otherwise noted. KG-PIE12 was synthesized by the University of Utah DNA/Peptide Core as
described in [8] and purified via RP-HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (TP, 22 x 250 mm, 10 µm,
300 Å). PIE12-GK and PIE12-trimer were synthesized as previously described [8]. SelMetIQN17-Q577R and HIV C34 were synthesized on a PS3 peptide synthesizer (Protein
Technologies, Inc.) at 80 µmol scale on NovaPEG Rink Amide LL resin (Novabiochem) and Rink

Amide AM resin LL (Novabiochem), respectively, via Fmoc-SPPS and were purified by RPHPLC.

Recombinant protein production:
Cys-Gly-Gly-Asp-IZN36 (derived from HXB2 strain) with a thrombin-cleavable His tag
was prepared as previously described [8]. A Q577R mutant version was generated via site-directed
mutagenesis using the QuikChange® protocol (Stratagene). Protein expression was performed in
BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) following Studier’s autoinduction protocol [23]. Inclusion bodies
containing IZN36 were solubilized in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM
imidazole, 6 M GuHCl, and sonicated. IZN36 was then purified using His-Select Ni-affinity resin
(Sigma). Ni-purified samples were dialyzed into water with 0.1% TFA and purified via RP-HPLC
on a Waters C18 column (BEH X-Bridge, 19 x 250 mm, 10 µm, 300 Å) with water/acetonitrile
gradient in 0.1% TFA and lyophilized. The cysteine residues of these constructs were biotinylated
for SPR. Reactions were carried out in PBS pH 7.0 with ~1-2 mg/mL protein and a 15X molar
excess of Biotin-dPEG®3-MAL (Quanta BioDesign) at room temp for 1 hr, followed by RP-HPLC
purification. The His tag was cleaved in PBS pH 6.3 with 10 µM heparin at a protein concentration
of ~0.8 mg/mL and one unit of thrombin protease (GE Healthcare) per mg of protein. The cleavage
reaction was incubated at 37ºC with agitation for 44 hrs followed by RP-HPLC as above.

Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis:
Protein interaction analysis was carried out on a Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare). Analyses
were performed in triplicate at 25ºC in sterile-filtered and degassed Gibco® PBS pH 7.4

streptavidin (Pierce) was immobilized on CM5 chips (GE Healthcare) using the Amine Coupling
Kit (GE Healthcare) following a standard coupling protocol [24]. Stocks (~50 nM) of biotinylated
IZN36 (WT and Q577R mutant) were prepared in running buffer in the presence of 1.2x molar
excess of HIV C34 and captured on the surface to a density of 100-200 RUs. Loading IZN36 in
the presence of C34 results in better behaved surfaces, and C34 was removed by surface
regeneration with 0.1% SDS injections. The active surface and a streptavidin-derivatized control
surface were blocked with D-biotin. Stock solutions of PIE12-GK were prepared at 50 μM in
running buffer, from which samples in the concentration series were generated by serial dilution
(three-fold to 2.54 nM). Injections were performed for 1 min using KINJECT. Dissociation was
monitored for 2 min, followed by a 20 μL injection (QUICKINJECT) of running buffer followed
by EXTRACLEAN. Sensorgrams were processed using Scrubber2 (BioLogic Software), and data
were analyzed with Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software). The equilibrium binding data were fit using
the built-in saturation binding model (one site -- specific binding), normalized to Bmax, and
replotted as concentration of analyte vs. % capacity.

Crystallography:
KG-PIE12 was crystallized in complex with Se-Met-IQN17-Q577R (1:1.1 IQN17:KGPIE12, 10 mg/mL total in water) at 21°C in Hampton Research condition SaltRx HT B4 (1.8 M
ammonium citrate dibasic, 0.1 M sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.6) by sitting-drop vapor
diffusion. Crystals were mounted in a nylon loop and either directly cryocooled by plunging into
liquid nitrogen or cryocooled following a 20 s immersion in 20 μL crystallization buffer with 20%
added glycerol. Crystals were maintained at 100 K during data collection. Data collection was

processed using HKL2000 [25]. The IQN17-Q577R/PIE12 structure was determined by molecular
replacement using PHASER [26] with PIE12-IQN17 (PDB structure 3L37) as the search model.
The model was rebuilt using O [27] and COOT [28] and refined against a maximum-likelihood
target function using PHENIX [29]. The structure was checked using the MolProbity program
[30]. See Table 2 for crystallographic data and refinement statistics. Buried surface area was
calculated with the program Naccess V2.1.1 [31]. For compatibility with Naccess, the surface areas
were calculated with the ACE and NH2 modified ends removed, and the names of the D-amino
acid residues changed to their cognate L-amino acids, without changing the coordinates.

Growth Assay:
CEM-GFP cells were infected with 1 ng p24 of either clonal pNL4-3, one of the Q577
point mutant viruses, or one of the polyclonal viral pools (W1 or W2) with DEAE dextran (8
µg/mL) and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Cells were then pelleted (2000 x g, for 5 min), supernatant
was removed, and cells were resuspended in fresh media. Cells were incubated for 3 days, then
the medium was changed every day for the next 7 days. Viral supernatant was collected on days
3, 5, 7, and 9 post-infection, and RNA was extracted using E.Z.N.A.® Viral RNA Kit (Omega
Bio-Tek). Viral levels were measured by qRT-PCR (Lightcycler 480, Roche) with primers
targeting a conserved region of Gag and compared to a standard curve of samples with known
quantities of p24.

Viral Inhibition Assays:
Viral infectivity was measured as previously described [32], with the following changes.
Replication-competent viruses were added to TZM-bl cells in the presence of a 10-fold dilution

PIE12-trimer stock in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4) and 8 µg/mL DEAE dextran. Medium was removed
after 30 hours, and cells were lysed with Glo Lysis buffer (Promega). BrightGlo luciferase
substrate (Promega) was added and luminescence was measured (POLARstar Optima, BMG).
TZM-bl cells exhibit significant background luminescence, so uninfected wells were used for
background subtraction. Luciferase activity was normalized to uninhibited controls, and IC50
values were determined from a fit to a Langmuir equation: y=1/(1+[inhibitor]/IC50) weighted by
the normalized standard error of replicates within an assay (with a minimum 1% error) using Prism
7.04 (GraphPad).
Results
Primary Resistance to PIE12-Trimer Arises Via Mutation of Q577 in the gp41
Hydrophobic Pocket
We previously reported the selection of HIV-1 populations resistant to PIE12-trimer by
passaging the lab-adapted NL4-3 strain in the presence of escalating suboptimal (partially
inhibiting) concentrations of inhibitor, starting with 1 nM. Ultimately, PIE12-trimer resistant virus
propagating in 320 nM PIE12-trimer was obtained after 65 weeks of passaging [8]. Duplicate
selections yielded two highly resistant polyclonal viral pools (W1 and W2). As previously
reported, similar passaging studies with enfuvirtide led to high-level resistance (>1000-fold)
within ~3 weeks [8]. Both W1 and W2 showed >650-fold loss of sensitivity to PIE12-trimer while
retaining full susceptibility to the C-peptide inhibitor, C37, demonstrating the ability of the virus
to specifically resist PIE12-trimer while maintaining the native interaction between the N-trimer
and C-peptide (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

Early analysis of a limited number of clones from the W2 resistant pool via Sanger
sequencing identified the mutation Q577R within the gp41 hydrophobic pocket in all clones [8].
In an HXB2 pseudovirion, Q577R confers >4000-fold resistance to PIE12-trimer [10]. Here, to
characterize the genetic basis of resistance and to understand the penetrance of the Q577R
mutation, we deep sequenced the W1 and W2 viral pools, as well as a pNL4-3 control viral pool
that had been propagated in the absence of inhibitors. This more extensive sequencing (with an
average sequencing depth of >200,000 reads per nucleotide position) revealed two distinct
mutations at position Q577 (codon CAG) in the highly resistant pools: N (codon AAC) in W1 and
R (codon CGG) in W2. Q577 is mutated in virtually all of the resistant virus (>97% of the
sequences in W1 and W2), and there were no spontaneous Q577 mutations in the control
population (Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, there are no other positions within the gp41
pocket that are mutated.

Q577R only requires a single nucleotide change, while Q577N requires a double mutation
and likely occurs stepwise. To determine which pathway the virus took to acquire the Q577N
substitution, we deep sequenced this N-trimer region from an intermediate pool of virus isolated
at an earlier timepoint during resistance selection and noted an equal ratio of N (AAC) and K
(AAG) (data not shown). In the context of replication-competent virus (NL4-3 strain), each Q577
mutant (R, N or K) confers substantial resistance to PIE12-trimer (~100-fold) and accounts for the
majority of the loss of sensitivity to PIE12-trimer (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

resistance compared to clonal virus expressing Env with Q577 point mutations. Representative
normalized data are shown from a single assay with triplicate measurements (error bars show
standard error). IC50 values of this representative data set are indicated in parentheses.

incorporated into an N-peptide mimic (IZN36 [17]), and the interaction was analyzed via surface
plasmon resonance (SPR). Because PIE12-trimer affinity is too tight to accurately measure via
SPR[8], monomeric PIE12 was flowed over the IZN36 (WT and Q577R) surfaces. The Q577R
mutation results in a dramatic (~65-fold) weakening of the interaction between PIE12-monomer
and the hydrophobic pocket (Q577R KD=2.0 µM vs. 0.031 µM for WT) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Fig. 1), corresponding to a 2.5 kcal/mol weakening of the PIE12 interaction. Because our inhibitor
is trimeric, we expect the impact on PIE12-trimer’s binding energy to be three times as great,
corresponding to a geometric drop of binding affinity of 653 (or >250,000). This large decrease in
binding affinity is consistent with the prediction that an extremely disruptive mutation is required
to overcome PIE12-trimer’s highly charged resistance capacitor.

To understand the molecular basis of Q577R-induced resistance, monomeric PIE12 was
crystallized in complex with an HIV-1 N-trimer pocket mimic (IQN17 [17]) with the Q577R
substitution, and the structure was determined at 1.3 Å resolution (Table 2). As in all previous Dpeptide/IQN17 structures [6, 8, 9], IQN17 forms a continuous trimeric coiled coil with the Dpeptide binding to the gp41 hydrophobic pocket region. When compared to our previously reported
1.45 Å structure of PIE12 binding to WT IQN17 (PDB code 3L37) [8], the overall structure agrees
well, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.34 Å for all Cα atoms. An overlay of these
two structures, centered around position 577 of the hydrophobic pocket is shown in Figure 3. The
WT structure shows that Q577 makes hydrogen bond contacts with D-Glu9 and D-Trp12 in PIE12
[8]. Q577R disrupts these hydrogen bonds, likely accounting for the loss of affinity, and induces
a repositioning of two adjacent residues (D-Glu9 in PIE12 and L581 in IQN17). These structural
changes lead to a minimal change in the buried surface area of the inhibitor interface with the Ntrimer target (555 and 524 Å2 in the WT and mutant structures, respectively).

Mutation of Q577 Causes a Significant Viral Growth Defect
The extended time required for evolution of high-level PIE12-trimer resistance in
passaging studies (65 weeks) and the high sequence conservation of the inhibitor binding site on
gp41 suggest that the primary Q577 resistance mutations come with a fitness cost to the virus.
We therefore investigated the growth kinetics of the NL4-3-based replication competent Q577
point mutants and the polyclonal viral pools (W1 and W2) and compared them to that of the

native virus (clonal NL4-3, WT). Starting with a virus inoculum containing 1 ng p24, indeed, the
growth of the Q577 mutants is significantly decreased compared to WT (Fig. 4). Q577R and
Q577K did not propagate significantly during the entire course of the assay, while Q577N
replication was substantially delayed. Interestingly, the PIE12-trimer resistant polyclonal pools
(W1 and W2) show similar growth kinetics to WT virus, suggesting that compensatory mutations
rescue the fitness defect associated with the Q577 mutants. WT, W1, and W2 all show rapid
growth and hit similar peak p24 levels. Importantly, starting viral titers of the Q577 mutant
stocks (normalized to p24) vary significantly from WT, ranging from greatly reduced (~40-fold
for Q577K and ~7-fold for Q577R) to increased (~3-fold for Q577N).

(average of biological duplicate assays shown with s.d. error bars).

Identification of Potential Compensatory Mutations to Overcome the Q577 Fitness Defect
To identify additional mutations that arose during the selection for resistance, the entire
env gene for each resistant pool (and control pool propagated in the absence of inhibitor) was deep
sequenced. To complement these short reads and obtain linkage information, we also performed
Sanger sequencing on 13 PIE12-trimer resistant clones (five from W1 and eight from W2). This
search should identify mutations that compensate for the fitness defects associated with
Q577R/N/K as well as those that contribute modestly to PIE12-trimer resistance, as W1 and W2
are slightly more resistant than the Q577 mutants alone (Fig. 1 and Table 1).
Using the deep sequencing data, we identified all point mutations, insertions, and deletions
within the env gene of the PIE12-trimer resistant populations with >10% absolute difference in
abundance from the control pool (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 1). We predict that 10% is a
high enough threshold to filter out noise due to genetic drift and sequencing errors, but low enough
to catch minor variations in the population that could contribute to resistance. Following these
guidelines, 25 candidate protein mutations (74 env nucleotide positions) were identified for further
analysis.
To focus our analysis on a more limited set of mutations most likely to contribute to
resistance and fitness compensation, we narrowed our list to the those that were not silent (except
in the Rev Response Element (RRE), where a silent mutation could impact RNA structure) and
with the highest penetrance (>50% abundance in both resistant viral pools but not in the control).
Eight mutations meet these criteria (indicated in bold in Table 3). Interestingly, when we compared

the clonal Sanger sequence data to these final mutations of interest, all but one are present in every
clone. Only A48T lacked 100% penetrance and was found in 3/5 W1 and 3/8 W2 clones.
In addition to identifying the primary resistance mutation (Q577R/N/K) in the PIE12trimer binding site, this analysis identified three gp120 and four gp41 mutations (Table 3 and Fig.
5). Of the gp120 mutations, one is a point mutation (A48T), and two are in-frame deletions (Δ161164 in the V1/V2 loop and Δ396-400 in the V4 loop). The V4 loop deletion truncates a tandem
duplication of 5 amino acids (FNSTWFNSTW), with only one FNSTW copy linked with PIE12trimer resistance. This deletion has also been reported in a virus resistant to T-2635, a thirdgeneration C-peptide fusion inhibitor [15]. The four gp41 mutations are all located outside the
PIE12 binding site. Two (Q550H and the silent V583V) are located within the RRE, L663F is in
the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER), and A823V is in the cytoplasmic domain
between LLP-3 and LLP-1.

the N-trimer coiled coil (N), a C-peptide region (C) that together with the N-trimer forms a 6helix bundle in the post-fusion state, a membrane-proximal external region (MPER), a
transmembrane domain (TM), and a cytoplasmic tail (CT). The primary resistance mutations

Discussion
This study identifies Q577R/N/K within the gp41 N-trimer hydrophobic pocket as the
primary resistance mechanism used to escape inhibition by the highly potent D-peptide entry
inhibitor PIE12-trimer. As predicted by the resistance capacitor hypothesis, the selection for highlevel resistance required: 1) extended passaging compared to those against earlier-generation entry
inhibitors, 2) a mutation that dramatically reduced inhibitor affinity at the cost of substantially
reduced viral fitness, and 3) compensatory mutations to restore viral fitness in the face of such a
destabilizing mutation. Despite these obstacles, HIV-1 was ultimately able to resist PIE12-trimer
in vitro.
Interestingly, even though the gp41 hydrophobic pocket is highly conserved, in rare cases
HIV-1 naturally accommodates alternate residues at position Q577. For example, the uncommon
Group O HIV-1 strains (<1% of global HIV-1 infections) primarily contain Q577R. Not
surprisingly, we previously observed high-level PIE12-trimer resistance in two HIV-1 Group O
isolates [8]. Additionally, within the >50,000 non-Group O sequences from the Los Alamos HIV
Sequence Database, ~1.4% contain Q577R.
Q577R has also been identified in viral resistance screens against other HIV-1 entry
inhibitors that target the prehairpin intermediate. Against N-trimer peptides N44, N36, and IZN36,
the C-peptide T2635, and the retrocyclin RC-101, Q577R is found in some [15, 34, 35] or all [36,
37] of the resistant viruses and always accompanied by other gp41 mutation(s). By itself, Q577R
provided only modest resistance to the N-trimer and C-peptide inhibitors (<3-fold) [15, 37]. Viral
escape from a recently identified adnectin, 6200_A08, which similarly targets the gp41
hydrophobic pocket, has also been shown to use Q577R as the primary mechanism [38]. Consistent

with our results, many of these studies have demonstrated a fitness defect for Q577R [15, 36-38].
Importantly, Q577R Env (HXB2 strain) has been shown to be properly expressed, processed, and
incorporated into pseudovirions, so the fitness defect is likely downstream of virus production
[39]. Surprisingly, genetic analysis of the virus from a patient resistant to the FDA-approved
peptide fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide also identified the Q577R mutation [40], and in the context of
that patient’s pre-treatment env, provided 25-fold resistance to enfuvirtide. This discovery is an
outlier, however, as the primary resistance mechanism to enfuvirtide involves mutation within
gp41 residues 547-556 [11], and the enfuvirtide sensitivity of other studied HIV-1 strains is
minimally affected by Q577R [15, 35-37]. Indeed, our data demonstrate only modest differences
in C-peptide inhibition of Q577R compared to WT pseudoviruses, including C34, T20
(enfuvirtide) and T1249 (Supplementary Table 2), and our PIE12-trimer resistant pools retain
sensitivity to a related peptide, C37 (Table 1).
The Q577 mutation in the critical N-trimer region could conceivably influence multiple
stages of the entry process, leading to its effect on viral fitness. Using multiple methods, Weiss, et
al. have investigated the effect of Q577R on Env structure and function. They have shown Q577R
leads to: 1) a more stable 6-helix bundle structure, 2) greater neutralization sensitivity to CD4
mimetics, and 3) decreased susceptibility to CD4-induced gp41 conformational changes that lead
to viral inactivation [34, 35, 37, 41]. This wide influence of Q577 mutation on Env function
supports the concept that both gp120 and gp41 modifications would be needed to restore viral
fitness, as is seen in our PIE12-trimer resistant pools. However, there is little overlap between the
Env modifications seen in our pools and those in naturally occurring strains with Q577R and in
Q577R virus resistant to other entry inhibitors. As shown in an alignment of the ~750 Group M
primary isolate Q577R Envs (out of >50,000 Group M sequences from the Los Alamos HIV

Sequence Database) with our PIE12-trimer resistant sequences, none of the candidate PIE12trimer-resistant compensatory mutations are prevalent in the primary isolates (Supplementary
Table 3). Additionally, we did not identify any overlap of our specific compensatory mutations
with those found in the other entry-inhibitor resistance screens with Q577R virus [15, 35-37].
Although none of our specific compensatory mutations are found in Q577R viruses
resistant to other entry inhibitors, it seems likely that similar compensation mechanisms are used.
In previous entry inhibitor resistance studies that include Q577R and for which gp120 sequence is
available [15, 34-36, 41], compensatory mutations are found in CD4 binding residues (E426K),
the V1/V2 loop (D167N), and in the V3 loop (R298K, S306G, I309M, T319I, and E322D),
indicating that changes to gp120-based fusion determinants, such as CD4 and co-receptor binding,
help restore gp41-based fitness defects. Our V1/V2 and V4 loop deletions may similarly affect
Env function. Additionally, several V3 loop mutants that are similar to those identified in other
resistance selections were found in some of our sequences (S306R, T319A).
The region of the HIV genome that encodes the highly conserved hydrophobic pocket (the
target of PIE12) also encodes part of the Rev-Response Element (RRE), whose specific RNA
structure is required for proper viral replication. Previous work showed that silent mutations at
Q550 and Q577, as well as the double mutant, are sufficient to induce structural changes in the
RRE [42]. Interestingly, Q550H and Q577R/N/K are observed in nearly all PIE12-trimer resistant
sequences. We postulate that the primary resistance mutation Q577, which is located at the base
of stem-loop V [43], forces a structural rearrangement of this conserved RRE structure and
contributes to the fitness defect. The presence of additional mutations within the RRE, namely
Q550H and a silent mutation at V583(GTGGTA), suggest these may play an important
compensatory role in restructuring the RRE. Q550 mutations, however, are not observed in any of

the 689 Q577R-containing primary isolates (Supplementary Table 3). Residue 583 is variable in
the Q577R-containing primary isolates, although only hydrophobic residues (valine, isoleucine,
leucine, and methionine) are observed.
Compensatory mutations to changes in the RRE could also be found in Rev, which binds
the RRE to promote the export of mRNA from the nucleus. Although our sequence analysis
focused on mutations in env, 80% of the Rev sequence (exon 2) is encoded within this same
genomic region. Three Rev mutations (env positions 2354, 2375 and 2435, leading to N86Y,
G93W, and G113R in Rev while silent in Env) surfaced in our initial analysis (Supplementary
Table 1), but each is present in only one resistant pool, none are fully penetrant, and all are located
in the predicted disordered nuclear export sequence [44]. Sequencing of rev exon 1 and functional
studies of mutant Rev/RRE will be required to see if there are any meaningful compensatory
changes in Rev.
We have also sought to improve the overall potency and breadth of PIE12-trimer by
conjugating it to cholesterol (chol-PIE12-trimer) to concentrate it at cell membrane lipid rafts, the
site of viral entry. This modification increases its association rate for the prehairpin intermediate
and improves potency ~100-fold [10]. Additionally, cholesterol conjugation prolongs the in vivo
half-life of the inhibitor, making it suitable for extended-release delivery [45]. With its improved
potency, chol-PIE12-trimer is better able to combat PIE12-trimer resistant virus and inhibits
pseudovirions with the Q577R mutation with a low nanomolar IC50 [10]. However, our preliminary
viral passaging studies in the presence of chol-PIE12-trimer suggest high-level resistant virus
ultimately emerges. Like for the PIE12-trimer resistant viruses, the pathway to resistance against
chol-PIE12-trimer includes mutation of Q577, and no other pocket mutations are observed. We

are currently studying the additional mutations acquired during chol-PIE12-trimer passaging to
understand the mechanism of resistance against this potential clinical candidate.
Ultimately, we hope to use the data described here to develop next-generation D-peptide
inhibitors that anticipate this route of resistance to create an even higher barrier to resistance.
Efforts are underway to discover novel D-peptide entry inhibitors that maintain high affinity to
both the native and Q577R pockets.
Conclusion
Although our highly potent, broad D-peptide entry inhibitor, PIE12-trimer, exhibits a high
barrier to resistance, with extended passaging (>1 year) we obtained HIV-1 resistant to PIE12trimer. The primary resistance mutation, Q577R/N/K, is found in the conserved PIE12-trimer
binding pocket on the gp41 N-trimer. Q577R disrupts two hydrogen bonds between PIE12-trimer
and the inhibitor-binding pocket and substantially decreases binding affinity. Q577 mutation
confers a significant fitness defect as seen by delayed viral replication. The highly resistant
polyclonal viral pools exhibit rescued fitness due to compensatory mutations found in gp120 and
gp41. Using deep sequencing analysis, we identified seven potential compensatory mutations
which will be the focus of future mechanistic studies. Possible compensatory mechanisms include
modifications to viral entry steps, such as receptor and co-receptor binding, fusion kinetics, Env
folding, and interactions between Rev and the RRE.
