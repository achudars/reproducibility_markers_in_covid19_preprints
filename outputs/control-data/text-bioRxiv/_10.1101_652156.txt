ABSTRACT
Copy number aberration events such as amplifications and
deletions in chromosomal regions are prevalent in cancer patients.
Frequently aberrated copy number regions include regulators such
as microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate downstream target genes
that involve in the important biological processes in tumorigenesis
and proliferation. Many previous studies explored the miRNAgene interaction networks but copy number-derived miRNA
regulations are limited. Identifying copy number-derived miRNAtarget gene regulatory interactions in cancer could shed some light
on biological mechanisms in tumor initiation and progression. In
the present study, we developed a computational pipeline, called
miRDriver which is based on the hypothesis that copy number data
from cancer patients can be utilized to discover driver miRNAs of
cancer. miRDriver integrates copy number aberration, DNA
methylation, gene and miRNA expression datasets to compute copy
number-derived miRNA-gene interactions in cancer. We tested
miRDriver on breast cancer and ovarian cancer data from the
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. miRDriver discovered
some of the known miRNAs, such as miR-125b, mir-320d, let-7g,
and miR-21, which are known to be in copy number aberrated
regions in breast cancer. We also discovered some potentially novel
miRNA-gene interactions. Also, several miRNAs such as miR-127,
miR-139 and let-7b were found to be associated with tumor
survival and progression based on Cox proportional hazard model.
We compared the enrichment of known miRNA-gene interactions
computed by miRDriver with the enrichment of interactions
computed by the state-of-the-art methods and miRDriver
outperformed all the other methods.

1 Introduction
Cancers, like many other diseases, can be defined as a disease of
altered gene expression due to dysregulation at the transcriptional
and post-transcriptional layers [1-2]. microRNAs (miRNAs) are
short non-coding RNAs that found to regulate gene expression
post-transcriptionally [3]. A single miRNA can corelate hundreds
of genes and can influence the tumor suppressor genes and
oncogenes [4].
miRNA dysregulation has been related to several types of cancer
[5]. Many studies discovered the affiliation of miRNAs to the
cancers driving genes in tumor initiation and progression. For
example, miR.125b, miR.145, miR.21 and miR.155 are known to
be involved in breast cancer [6] and, miR.27b and miR.181d are
known to be involved in ovarian cancer [7-8].
Efforts were dedicated in integrating and analyzing highthroughput expression data to find cancer specific miRNA-gene
interaction networks [9-10]. Mutual information-based methods
such as AraCNe [11] and ProMISe [12] to infer gene regulatory
networks received popularity. To explore the causal relationship
among miRNA and gene (i.e. direct or indirect effects of miRNA
on genes), invariant causal prediction (ICP) methods like HiddenICP, ICP-PAM50 emerged [13]. Other casual inference-based
methods such as idaFast [14] and jointIDA [15] were also
developed. These techniques were implemented using expression
profiles of miRNAs and genes.
Several studies also explored the integration of multidimensional
omics data in cancer [16] such as copy number alteration (CNA),
and gene expression to infer gene regulatory interactions based on
the premise that CNA regions could harbor driver regulatory genes

in cancer [17-18]. Akavia et al., 2010 developed a Bayesian
network-based computational tool, CONEXIC that integrates copy
number and gene expression data for detecting aberrations in
cancer progression. A few studies (Setty et al., 2010; Li et al.,
2014), applied regression-based approach to integrate copy
number, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression to predict gene
expression changes in terms of transcription factors (TFs) and
miRNA expression. In their efforts of integrating CNA, miRNA
and gene expression, these studies used miRNAs from all genomic
regions.
CNA regions have been reported to harbor key miRNAs, too [19].
Calin et al. [20] found that miR.15a and miR.16a were located in
chromosome 13q14.3, which is frequently deleted in B cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemias. Zang et al. [21] studied 283 miRNAs
associated with breast cancers and confirmed that 72.8 % of
miRNAs are in CNA regions.
Despite the existence of potential driver miRNAs in CNA regions,
to the best of our knowledge, there is no computational method that
mine these areas to identify key miRNAs and their potential targets.
To address this gap, in the current study, we specifically considered
the CNA regions to infer CNA-derived miRNA-gene interactions
in cancer. We hypothesized that CNA regions may host driver
miRNAs and these miRNAs could regulate key biological
processes in cancer by targeting some downstream genes. We
developed a computational pipeline called miRDriver, which
integrates gene and miRNA expression, copy number alteration,
DNA methylation and TF-gene interaction information to infer
copy number-derived miRNA-gene networks in cancer. In
miRDriver, we retrieved frequently aberrated copy number regions
among cancer patients using GISTIC [22-23]. For each region, we
computed differentially expressed genes (DE) between frequently
aberrated patients and not-frequently aberrated patients, and
applied a LASSO-based [24] regression model to select miRNAs
which could potentially regulate DE genes’ expression.
We assessed miRDriver using breast cancer and ovarian cancer
data from TCGA [25] database. miRDriver outperformed AraCNe,
ProMISe, Hidden-ICP, ICP-PAM50, IDAfast and jointIDA in
retrieving significantly enriched miRNA-gene interactions with the
known miRNA-gene interaction databases. We observed that a
higher number of selected prognostic miRNAs in frequently
aberrated patients than in not-frequently aberrated cancer patients.
Furthermore, the miRNAs selected by miRDriver were found to be
enriched in known cancer-related miRNAs and our selected genes
were found to be enriched in many cancer-related pathways.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 miRDriver
We developed miRDriver, a computational pipeline to infer copy
number aberration-based miRNA-gene interactions in cancer.
miRDriver integrates gene expression, copy number alteration,
DNA methylation, transcription factor-gene interaction and

B. Bose et al.
miRNA expression data. miRDriver has four main computational
steps (Fig.1). In the first step, we employed GISTIC tool to find
frequently aberrated chromosomal regions among cancer patients
and called these regions as GISTIC regions. In the second step, for
each GISTIC region we computed differentially expressed (DE)
genes between frequently aberrated and non-aberrated patient
groups. In the third step, we retrieved DE genes and miRNAs that
reside in aberrated regions (i.e. cis genes and cis miRNAs) and
retrieved DE genes that are outside of aberrated regions (i.e. trans
genes). In the last step, we employed a LASSO-based regression
model to compute miRNA regulators of the trans genes. In what
follows, we describe the four steps of miRDriver in details. The
entire pipeline of miRDriver is illustrated in Fig.1. The source code
for
miRDriver

https://github.com/bozdaglab/miRDriver under MIT license. All the
supplementary files referenced in this manuscript can be accessed on the
same page.

2.1.1 Finding GISTIC regions. Our pipeline was developed based on
the assumption that chromosomal regions that undergo CNA events
among cancer patients could harbor driver miRNAs and these
miRNAs could regulate downstream target genes in cancer. We
used GISTIC 2.0 to identify chromosomal regions that were
frequently aberrated within the patient cohort. We used a high
confidence interval level of 0.90 to calculate frequently aberrated
chromosomal regions (hereafter GISTIC regions). GISTIC regions
with a log $ ratio above 0.1 were considered amplified and GISTIC
regions with a log $ ratio below −0.1 were considered deleted.
2.1.2 Finding DE genes. To identify transcriptional effect that is
potentially due to a CNA event, we computed DE genes for each
GISTIC region. For each GISTIC region, we divided cancer
patients into two groups, frequently aberrated group and notfrequently aberrated group. We used edgeR [26] package in R to
compute DE genes among these two groups (absolute log fold
change (logFC) ≥ 1, adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05). We annotated DE
genes that were located inside the GISTIC region as cis genes and
DE genes outside of the GISTIC region were considered as trans
gene.
2.1.3 Gathering cis genes and cis miRNAs. In this step, we retrieved
miRNAs located in each GISTIC region (i.e. cis miRNAs). The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [25] database for miRNA Gene
Quantification data and Isoform data containing chromosomal
regions were used to retrieve miRNAs reside within each GISTIC
region using bedr package in R. Then, for each trans gene, we

collected all cis genes and cis miRNAs from all the GISTIC regions
where gene was appeared as DE trans gene. At the end of this step
we had all possible trans-cis combinations for the entire patient
cohort. We considered only those trans genes that had at least one
cis miRNA predictor.
2.1.4 Selection of miRNA regulators for each trans gene. For each
DE trans gene miRDriver predicted the associated cis miRNAs that
influenced the trans gene’s expression variation. Because trans
gene’s expression can be influenced by other potential regulators
such as cis genes in the same GISTIC region(s), TFs that are known
to target this trans gene, and CNA and DNA methylation signals of
this trans gene, we applied a LASSO-based predictor selection
method with all these potential predictors as independent variables
and the trans gene’s expression as response variable. We applied
10-fold cross validation to find the optimal regularization
hyperparameter λ that provided the simplest model such that its
cross-validation error was the minimum cross-validation error. For
each trans gene, out of all its candidate predictors (independent
variables), LASSO regression selected a set of non-zero coefficient
predictors. We employed R package glmnet [27] to perform
LASSO. Since the independent variables selected by LASSO have
been shown to be inconsistent especially when sample size gets
large [28], for each trans gene we ran LASSO 100 times. Only the
cis miRNAs whose coefficients appeared to be non-zero at least 70
times were selected as potential regulator miRNAs.

2.2 Datasets

2.2.1 Datasets to run miRDriver. We assessed miRDriver on breast
and ovarian cancer datasets from TCGA. We used TCGABiolinks
[29] to download the genomic data of cancer patients from TCGA.
We retrieved gene expression quantification data for raw count
mRNA (Illumina HiSeq), miRNA-gene quantification expression
with file type hg19.mirbase20.mirna and miRNA isoform gene
quantification data with file type hg19.mirbase20.isoform from the
legacy data.
For mRNA data (i.e. RNA sequencing data), lowly expressed genes
were eliminated and rest of the mRNA expression were converted
to RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped
reads) values. We used the miRNAs that have ≥ 0.01 RPM (Reads
per million mapped reads) value across ≥ 30% of the entire cohort.
We retrieved masked copy number variation (Affymetrix SNP
Array 6.0) and computed the gene-centric copy number value
compatible with hg38 using R Bioconductor package CNTools
[30].
We downloaded DNA methylation data from Infinium
HumanMethylation27
Bead-Chip
(27K)
and
Infinium
HumanMethylation450 Bead-Chip (450K) platforms. Genespecific beta values were calculated separately for both platforms.
For the 450K platform, average beta value for promoter-specific
probes were considered due to their role in transcriptional silencing
[31]. Given lower coverage in the 27K platform, we utilized all the
probes. In this case, we set the DNA methylation of a gene as the
average of beta values of all its probes.

ACM-BCB’19, Sept. 2019, Niagara Falls, NY USA
To incorporate TF-gene interactions in the LASSO step (Section
2.1.3), we downloaded experimentally-validated TF-gene
interactions from TRED [32] and TRRUST [33] databases.
2.2.2 Datasets to evaluate miRDriver’s results. To evaluate the
selected miRNA-gene interactions by miRDriver, we use the list of
experimentally-verified miRNA-gene interactions used in [34] as
our ground truth. Since miRDriver could identify indirect
downstream targets (i.e., target of a direct target) as well as direct
targets, we included potential indirect targets to the ground truth
dataset. Specifically, for each miRNA-gene interaction where gene
is a known TF, we included the experimentally-validated targets of
this TF as the indirect target of this miRNA. We downloaded
experimentally-validated TF-target regulatory datasets from TRED
[32] and TRRUST [33] databases. For clinical data we used TCGA
Clinical Data Resource [35] with clinical outcome endpoints for
BRCA and OV.
To evaluate if the miRNAs selected by miRDriver were enriched
in cancer-related miRNAs, we downloaded a list of known cancer
related miRNAs from oncomiRDB database [36]. Each miRNA
listed in oncomiRDB is involved in at least one cancer-related
phenotype or cellular process. We harmonized the names of
oncomiRDB miRNAs with reference to miRBase [37] database.

B. Bose et al.
gene we ran LASSO 100 times. After LASSO, there were 1,858
and 1,347 selected miRNA-gene interactions for BRCA and OV,
respectively. Among them BRCA had 187 miRNAs and 1,114
genes and OV had 147 miRNAs and 548 genes. The selected
miRNA-gene interactions by miRDriver for each cancer type are
listed in Supplemental Table 2.

4 Evaluation of miRDriver’s results
We performed several tests to assess the results of miRDriver. To
test accuracy of the miRNA-gene interactions inferred by
miRDriver, we performed a hypergeometric test between the
computed targets of each miRNA and their known targets in our
ground truth dataset (see Section 2.2.2). We also compared
miRDriver with some of the existing methods and observed that
miRDriver outperformed them in selecting significantly enriched
mRNA-gene interactions. Also, we checked miRDriver’s
performance in different subsets of breast cancer patients and found
that there was significant overlap in miRDriver’s results on random
subsets of the data. We also performed enrichment test for the
selected miRNAs with the experimentally-validated oncogenic
miRNA in oncomiRDB. The selected miRNAs by miRDriver were
significantly enriched in the oncogenic miRNAs.

3 Results

In the following sections we presented the details of miRDriver
evaluation.

We developed a computational pipeline called miRDriver which
integrates CNA, DNA methylation, TFs-gene interactions, gene
and miRNA expression datasets to compute copy number-derived
miRNA-gene interactions in cancer.

4.1
Computed miRNA-gene interactions were
enriched in the known miRNA-target interactions

We assessed miRDriver using breast and ovarian cancer datasets
from TCGA. We downloaded RNA sequencing data of primary
tumors in 1097 and 586, breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and
ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) patients, respectively.
We used copy number segmentation data from TCGA to find
frequently aberrated chromosomal regions, namely, GISTIC
regions using GISTIC 2.0 (see Section 2.1.1). We merged
overlapping GISTIC regions using R Bioconductor package bedr
and considered 66 and 64 GISTIC regions for BRCA and OV,
respectively. Among these regions, 43 and 56 GISTIC regions
harbor miRNAs in BRCA and OV, respectively. We used R
package edgeR to compute DE trans and cis genes for each GISTIC
region (see Section 2.1.2). Using R package bedr, we retrieved
miRNAs from each GISTIC region (see Section 2.1.3). Altogether,
255 cis miRNAs for BRCA and 301 cis miRNAs for OV were used
in miRDriver. We provided the count of DE cis genes, cis miRNAs
and DE trans gene for GISTIC regions in each cancer type in
Supplemental Table 1. We employed a LASSO- based regression
with trans gene’s expression as response variable and expression
of cis miRNAs as independent variables. In order to account for
other potential regulators of trans gene’s expression, we also
included expression of cis genes, copy number values of the trans
gene, DNA methylation beta values of the trans gene and
expression of TFs targeting that trans gene as independent
variables in LASSO. We employed 10,494 trans genes for BRCA
and 3,117 trans genes for OV (see Section 2.1.4). For each trans

interactions in the known miRNA-gene interaction in
BRCA and OV. P-value column shows the hypergeometric
p-value.

To check if the miRNA-gene interactions computed by miRDriver
were significantly enriched in the known miRNA-gene
interactions, we performed a hypergeometric test (see Section
2.2.2). We considered only those miRNAs that had at least one
known target in the ground truth data for the hypergeometric test.
For breast cancer 59 miRNAs and for ovarian cancer 27 miRNAs
were used in the hypergeometric test. For breast cancer 63%
predicted miRNAs and for ovarian cancer 89% miRNAs showed
significant enrichment (p-value ≤ 0.05). The hypergeometric test
result for a few miRNAs is provided in Table 1 with the count of
computed targets and p-value for each miRNA. The entire list of

Networks in Cancer
selected miRNAs with hypergeometric result is listed in
Supplemental Table 3.

4.2 miRDriver outperformed six existing methods
for computing miRNA-gene interactions
We compared the accuracy of miRNA-gene interactions computed
by miRDriver with six other popular methods namely, AraCNe,
hiddenICP, ProMIse, idaFast, jointIDA and icpPAM50 using
BRCA data. For AraCNe, ProMIse and hiddenICP we used 6504
input genes and 255 miRNAs, the same inputs we used in
miRDriver. We applied different thresholds to select reported
miRNA-gene interactions based on reported scores to get highly
confident interactions for our comparison.
We used the AraCNe implementation in the R package minet [38]
and computed 273 miRNA-gene interactions with non-zero scores
and used all of them. For the other methods, we used R package
miRLAB [39]. After applying ProMIse method, we considered top
3 percentile of miRNA-gene interactions based on ProMISe scores.
To run hiddenICP, we divided the BRCA patients into three
random subsets of similar size to create the “different
environments” required by the program. hiddenICP reports scores
for all miRNA-gene pairs and we kept the top 2000 (top 3
percentile) of reported miRNA-gene interactions as the final
interactions based on causal scores.
icpPAM50 also requires “different environments” based on the
expression of PAM50 genes [40]. To address this requirement, we
used the expression profiles of PAM50 genes from TCGA
icpPAM50 to cluster the patients into multiple “environments”.
Since icpPAM50 is not computationally efficient to run with high
dimensional data, we used top 30 miRNAs and top 800 genes as
input selected by the Feature Selection Based on The Most Variant
Median Absolute Deviation (FSbyMAD) [41] method as used in
[42]. We considered the top 2000 (top 8 percentile) of miRNA-gene
interactions based on reported scores.
Since idaFast and jointIDA methods have high computational
complexity and therefore are not scalable to large datasets, we run
these two methods with top 50 miRNAs and top 1149 genes
selected by using FSbyMAD. For idaFast, we selected top 2000
(top 3.5 percentile) of miRNA-gene interactions based on reported
causal effect scores. We run jointIDA using R package ParallelPC
[43]. In this case, we considered miRNA-gene interactions based
on top 8.7 percentile of reported causal effect scores to get high
confidence interactions.
We performed hypergeometric test to measure enrichment
significance of computed miRNA targets in the known miRNAgene interaction data (see Section 4.1). miRDriver had more
significant miRNAs (i.e., hypergeometric test p-value ≤ 0.05) than
all the other six methods (Table 2). These results indicate the
performance of miRDriver in inferring accurate miRNA-gene
interactions.

4.3 miRDriver produced significantly overlapping
results on random subsets BRCA data

ACM-BCB’19, Sept. 2019, Niagara Falls, NY USA
We tested the consistency of miRDriver results by splitting the
BRCA data into two random patient groups. First, we miRDriver
run on the entire patient cohort (i.e., W) then on two randomly
chosen subsets, 𝑆* and 𝑆$ . We used the same input genes (trans
genes) and input miRNAs (cis miRNAs) for all three sets. A few
genes that had constant expression values among all the patients in
a set were omitted from the LASSO step of miRDriver. We listed
the number of input genes and miRNAs, and selected genes,
miRNAs and miRNA-gene interactions for each dataset in Table 3.
We found that miRDriver selected higher number of interactions
and genes using set 𝑆* than number of genes and interactions using
set W and 𝑆$ . Despite these differences, the overlap between them
were significant. We performed the hypergeometric test to check
the significance of selected overlapping miRNAs, selected genes
and selected miRNA-gene interactions between each pair of these
three sets and found all these overlaps were significant having
hypergeometric p value ≤ 0.05 (Table 4). These results suggest that
miRDriver could produce consistent results in different datasets of
the same cancer type.

4.4
Selected miRNAs were enriched in the
cancer-associated miRNAs
To test if the miRNAs selected by miRDriver were enriched in the
cancer-related miRNAs, we used a list of 351 known oncogenic
miRNAs from oncomiRDB (see Section 2.2.2). We performed
Fisher’s exact test to check the association between the
oncomiRDB miRNAs and selected miRNAs by miRDriver. For
each cancer type, the background sets in the hypergeometric test
consisted of all 1870 TCGA miRNAs among which 344 were
common with oncomiRDB. In BRCA, 69 of 187 selected miRNAs
and 275 of 1683 non-selected miRNAs were in oncomiRDB (pvalue= 17.9e,** ). In OV, 36 of 147 selected miRNAs were and 308
of 1723 non-selected miRNAs were in oncomiRDB (p-value =
0.03). The results indicate that miRDriver tends to select cancerrelated miRNAs.

4.5
Selected miRNAs and genes were associated
with survival of cancer patients.
We performed multivariate survival analysis to assess the
prognostic relevance of the selected and non-selected miRNAs by
miRDriver. For breast cancer we considered age, race, HER2
status, estrogen status and progesterone status with the miRNA
expression as independent variables and for OV age and race with
miRNA expression were considered. In order to remove the
confounding effect of other factors, we used the Adjusted KaplanMeier Estimator to compute adjusted survival curves by weighting

the individual contributions by the inverse probability weighting
(IPW) [44] using the R package IPWsurvival [45]. We considered
two end points, Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free
Survival (PFI). In OS, patients who were dead from any cause
considered as dead, otherwise censored. In PFI, patient having new
tumor event whether it was a progression of disease, local
recurrence, distant metastasis, new primary tumor event, or died
with the cancer without new tumor event, including cases with a
new tumor event whose type is N/A were considered as dead and
all other patients were censored [35]. We computed prognostic
miRNAs and genes while considering the entire patient cohort by

dividing them into two groups as high expression and low
expression of miRNA group. We found that a higher proportion of
the selected miRNAs were prognostic miRNAs (log rank test pvalue ≤ 0.05) than of the non-selected miRNAs (Table 5). To
demonstrate the prognostic effect of the selected miRNAs in
aberrated and non-aberrated patient groups, for each GISTIC
region, we performed the survival analysis of the selected and nonselected miRNAs in that region within the frequently aberrated and
non-frequently aberrated patient groups separately. We observed
that selected miRNAs that were prognostic were higher in
percentage in frequently aberrated patients than in non-frequently
aberrated patients compared to non-selected miRNAs in BRCA for
PFI end point and in OV for both OS and PFI end points except for
when using OS as end point for BRCA (Table 6). Two examples of
selected miRNAs from each cancer that have significant effect in
aberrated patient group but not in the non-aberrated patient group
are shown in Fig. 2. For instance, the patients in the frequently
deleted group of the GISTIC region that harbors hsa-let-7g have
worse survival when the hsa-let-7g is expressed low. The survival

miRDriver: A Tool to Infer Copy Number Derived miRNA-Gene
Networks in Cancer

curves for all prognostic selected miRNAs in aberrated and nonaberrated groups are in the Supplementary File 1.
We computed the hazard ratio (HR) of higher degree selected genes
(genes targeted by four or more miRNAs) and lower degree
selected genes (genes targeted by three or fewer miRNAs) using
multivariate Cox regression analysis [46]. The genes with Cox
regression p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as prognostic genes. A
ln (HR) > 0 implies that an increase of expression of the gene
increases the risk of an event, while a ln (HR) < 0 implies that an
increase of the gene expression decreases the risk of an event.
We compared the median of the ln (HR) of each group using the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. In BRCA with OS, interestingly higher
degree genes possessed lower hazard ratios whereas in OV with

PFI, higher degree genes possessed higher hazard ratios compared
to lower degree genes (Fig. 3A, B).

5 Discussion
We developed a computational pipeline called miRDriver, which
integrates multi omics datasets such as copy number variation,
DNA methylation, transcription factors, gene and miRNA
expression to infer copy number-derived miRNA-gene interactions
in cancer. We applied miRDriver on breast and ovarian cancer
datasets from TCGA. In each case, miRDriver was able to select
many miRNA-gene interactions that were enriched in known
miRNA-target databases. We observed that selected miRNAs by
miRDriver were significantly enriched in the known cancer-related

miRNAs. The selected miRNAs that targeted many genes, for
instance miR-23a, miR-27b, miR-181d in ovarian, miR-1224, miR31, let-7g in breast cancer and let-7b in both cancers are known to
be involved in cancer [48-51]. Hu et al. found that miR-23a has
role in promoting tumor growth and apoptosis via target gene
PDCD4 in gastric cancer [54]. A recent study found association of
miR-1224 in tumor metastasis in gastric cancer [57]. It was found
that let-7 family is related with tumorigenesis in breast cancer [55].
Studies on deregulated let-7 expression and its role in
tumorigenesis have been conducted [56].
We evaluated the prognostic value of miRDriver’s selected
miRNAs vs non-selected miRNA’s using Adjusted Kaplan-Myer
survival analysis. We found that percentage of prognostic miRNAs
was greater in selected miRNAs than in non-selected miRNAs,
which indicates that miRDriver tends to select prognostic miRNAs.
Also, percentage of prognostic miRNAs was higher in copy number
aberrated patient cohort than in non-aberrated regions, which
suggests that copy number aberration event tends to increase the
prognostic value of miRNAs.
In BRCA, the selected high degree genes (i.e., genes targeted by ≥4
miRNAs) had low hazard ratios (HR) (median ln (HR) = -9.44) in
patient’s survival with progression free interval (see Section 4.5 &
Fig. 3A). This result suggests that these genes tend to be acting as
tumor suppressor genes. Among these high degree genes, CLIC6
was found to be associated in ion channels, which are implicated in
breast cancer [58]. In a recent work [59], the mechanism of CLIC
proteins in promoting an aggressive invasive carcinoma was
explored. Another selected high degree gene in BRCA, PALM2
showed differential expression in chemotherapy response in
patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma [60]. Conversely, in
OV, the selected high degree genes had high hazard ratios (HR)
(median ln (HR) = 9.77) in overall survival of cancer patients (Fig.
3B). This result suggests that these high degree genes tend to be
acting as oncogenes. In OV, high degree genes like MEP1B was
reported to be associated with proliferation and invasion of
colorectal cancer [61] and LINC00189 reported to be a possible
biomarker of the bladder cancer [62]. These studies support the idea
of exploring these high degree genes as tumor suppressor genes and
oncogenes. These high degree genes can serve as potential
biomarkers to predict prognosis in cancer patients.
We compared miRDriver’s LASSO steps with network-based
methods AraCNe and ProMIse, and causal inference-based
methods such as hiddenICP, ICP-PAM50, idaFast and jointIDA.
We showed that miRDriver substantially outperformed other tools
in selection of significantly known miRNA-gene interactions
(Table 2). We also checked the consistency of miRDriver results in
different subsets of breast cancer patients and found significant
overlaps between different results (Table 3).
In miRDriver, we integrated high dimensional multi omics data and
it possessed some computational challenges. To control this, we ran
our LASSO step in parallel clusters. For breast cancer, we ran
1,049,400 LASSO regressions using 210 cores Dual Intel
Processors with 512 GB RAM. Despite of that, due to large number
of patients and trans genes in breast cancer data, it took five days
to complete the computation. Whereas, for ovarian cancer, the

B. Bose et al.
computation was finished within 2 hours due to fewer patients and
trans genes.
For the future versions of miRDriver, more datasets such as
mutations, histone modification and chromatin accessibility
datasets such as ATAC-seq could be incorporated. The current
version of miRDriver does not incorporate the competing
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interactions [64]. These interactions
could affect how miRNAs interact with their target genes. When
computing potential targets of miRNAs, putative ceRNA
interactions could be computed simultaneously.
In conclusion, we presented miRDriver, a computational method
that integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic datasets to
infer copy number derived miRNAs that affect downstream target
genes in cancer. This could help find genes which could be
therapeutic targets of drugs and opens the opportunity to establish
novel biomarkers.
