Summary

13

Many bacteria exist in a state of metabolic quiescence where they must minimize energy

14

consumption so as to maximize available resources over a potentially extended period of time.

15

As protein synthesis is the most energy intensive metabolic process in a bacterial cell, it would be

16

an appropriate target for downregulation during the transition from growth to quiescence. We find

17

that when Bacillus subtilis exits growth, a subpopulation of cells emerges with very low levels of

18

protein synthesis dependent on synthesis of the nucleotides (p)ppGpp. We show that (p)ppGpp

19

inhibits protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro by preventing the allosteric activation of the essential

20

GTPase Initiation Factor 2 (IF2) during translation initiation. Finally, we demonstrate that IF2 is

21

an authentic in vivo target of (p)ppGpp during the entry into quiescence, thus providing a

22

mechanistic basis for the observed attenuation of protein synthesis.

Introduction

25

Most microbial life exists in a non-proliferating state of quiescence that enables survival during

26

nutrient limitation and in stressful environments (Lennon and Jones, 2011; Rittershaus et al.,

27

2013). A major challenge facing a quiescent cell is how to minimize energy consumption so as to

28

maximize available resources over a potentially extended period of time. As protein synthesis is

29

the most energy intensive metabolic process in a cell, accounting for as much as ~70% of total

30

energy consumption in bacteria (Tempest and Neijssel, 1984), it would be an appropriate target

31

for downregulation during the transition from growth to quiescence. Metabolic conditions that may

32

be present during this transition such as amino acid limitation would reduce protein synthesis, but

33

whether it is also actively inhibited remains an open question.

34

Several highly conserved, essential GTPases participate in translation (Maracci and

35

Rodnina, 2016). For example, IF2 is involved in initiation and EF-Tu and EF-G are involved in

36

elongation. Thus, as key factors in translation, these proteins are appealing regulatory targets for

37

quiescence-dependent attenuation of protein synthesis. In the bacterium B. subtilis undergoing

38

sporulation, a well-characterized developmental pathway leading to quiescence, phosphorylation

39

of EF-Tu inhibits its ability to hydrolyze GTP, an activity essential for its function in translation,

40

and thereby blocks protein synthesis (Pereira et al., 2015). How else could these GTPases be

41

targeted? Binding of a ligand other than GTP to the GTP binding site could affect protein function.

42

For example, in vitro, the hyperphosphorylated nucleotides guanosine tetraphosphate and penta-

43

phosphate, derived from GDP and GTP, respectively, can bind and thereby inhibit translational

44

GTPases (Hamel and Cashel, 1974). These so-called alarmones, collectively termed (p)ppGpp,

45

are the major mediators of the stringent response, the mechanism used by bacteria to coordinate

46

a response to cell stresses including nutrient deprivation (Gaca et al., 2015; Steinchen and Bange,

47

2016). For example, (p)ppGpp synthesis occurs during the entry into stationary phase and in the

48

presence of amino acid limitation (Steinchen and Bange, 2016). (p)ppGpp is responsible for the

49

down-regulation of metabolic processes including transcription, replication, and GTP synthesis

50

that are mediated by a direct interaction with RNA polymerase (Artsimovitch et al., 2004; Ross et

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/807917; this version posted October 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

51

al., 2016), DNA primase (Wang et al., 2007) and the GTP biosynthetic enzymes HprT and Gmk

52

(Kriel et al., 2012), respectively.

53

Overexpression of a truncated RelA protein that synthesizes (p)ppGpp in the absence of
35

54

amino acid limitation results in a rapid decrease in

S-methionine incorporation (Svitil et al.,

55

1993), consistent with an inhibitory effect of (p)ppGpp on translation. However, further

56

investigation of a direct effect of (p)ppGpp on translation has been complicated by several factors.

57

First, (p)ppGpp affects synthesis of ribosomal proteins in E. coli (Lindahl et al., 1976). Whether

58

this effect is direct has been difficult to assess given the well-established effect of (p)ppGpp on

59

transcription by E. coli polymerase. Second, studies examining the effect of (p)ppGpp produced

60

by RelA use conditions that produce uncharged tRNAs in order to stimulate RelA (Arenz et al.,

61

2016; Brown et al., 2016; Haseltine and Block, 1973; Loveland et al., 2016; O'Farrell, 1978). Since

62

uncharged tRNAs directly arrest translation, it has been difficult to differentiate this effect from a

63

direct effect of (p)ppGpp on translation.

64

In vitro, (p)ppGpp inhibits translation in a manner similar to that observed with non-

65

hydrolyzable GTP analogs (Wagner and Kurland, 1980), suggesting that (p)ppGpp is targeting a

66

translational GTPase. Consistently, (p)ppGpp inhibits the GTPase activity of IF2 and EF-Tu

67

(Hamel and Cashel, 1974) as well as of GTPases that mediate other aspects of translation such

68

as ribosome assembly (Corrigan et al., 2016; Pausch et al., 2018), by acting as competitive

69

inhibitors. (p)ppGpp is capable of binding translational GTPases including EF-Tu, EF-G (Rojas et

70

al., 1984), IF2 (Milon et al., 2006; Mitkevich et al., 2010) and the ribosome assembly GTPase

71

ObgE (Persky et al., 2009) at affinities that are commensurate with the in vivo levels of (p)ppGpp

72

observed following stringent response induction, consistent with the enzymes being in vivo

73

targets. Of note, the affinity of IF2 for (p)ppGpp as compared to EF-G (Mitkevich et al., 2010) and

74

the observation that (p)ppGpp interferes with IF2 function (Milon et al., 2006) suggests that IF2

75

may be a principal target in vivo. However, this is not known.

76

Here we show that during the transition into a non-proliferative state, Bacillus subtilis

77

exhibits a large reduction in protein synthesis that is dependent on (p)ppGpp. We further show

78

that both in vivo and in vitro, (p)ppGpp inhibits protein synthesis by targeting translation. Next, we

79

identify mutations in IF2 which allow us to demonstrate in vitro that it is a direct target of (p)ppGpp

80

during translation. We then show that binding of ppGpp fails to allosterically stabilize a

81

conformation of IF2 that is typically triggered by binding of GTP and that enables IF2 to stably

82

bind the ribosomal small, or 30S, subunit initiation complex (IC) and catalyze rapid joining of the

83

ribosomal large, or 50S, subunit to the 30S IC. Finally, we demonstrate in vivo that binding of

84

(p)ppGpp to IF2 mediates the observed (p)ppGpp-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis.

85
86

Results

87

Protein synthesis is inhibited in a (p)ppGpp dependent manner during stationary phase

88

B. subtilis grows exponentially in LB until a stereotypic cell density, presumably dictated by

89

nutrient availability. After this point, growth occurs more slowly (non-exponentially) in the transition

90

phase which culminates in the non-proliferative state of stationary phase (Figure 1A). We

91

assayed protein synthesis during different growth phases by measuring incorporation of the

92

puromycin analog O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) that can be visualized and quantified in single

93

cells following addition of a fluorophore using click chemistry (Liu et al., 2012). Incorporation of

94

OPP results in the accumulation of fluorescently tagged nascent polypeptide chains that directly

95

reflects the rate of translation (Liu et al., 2012). Although puromycin causes premature termination

96

of protein synthesis resulting from its incorporation into the nascent polypeptide chain, global

97

protein synthesis occurs even following addition of OPP under our conditions (Figure S1). Other

98

methods for measuring protein synthesis exist, but they rely on growing cells in the absence of

99

amino acids (specifically methionine). This poses a particular problem for strains which exhibit

100

autotrophies to these amino acids, such as those lacking (p)ppGpp (Kriel et al., 2014). Thus, the

101

use of OPP allows us to examine protein synthesis under conditions where amino acids are not

102

specifically limiting as well as at the level of single cells.

103

We labeled B. subtilis cultures with OPP at a series of time points (Figure 1A; dashed black

104

lines). As expected, cells exhibited a progressive decrease in OPP incorporation soon after

105

departure from exponential growth (early transition) that continued as the cells grew slowly in late

106

transition (Figure 1B, top). This trend is apparent in the average cellular fluorescence at these

107

time points as well as in stationary phase (Figure S2A, gray bars). However, at the late transition

108

time point, a substantial fraction of cells in the population appeared to lose all fluorescent signal

109

(Figure 1B, top). This loss of signal indicates an absence of protein synthesis, resulting in a

110

population whose distribution of the rates of protein synthesis is roughly bimodal at the single cell

111

level (Figure 1C; gray). This heterogeneity is consistent with the inhibition of protein synthesis

112

being a direct and acute effect in a sub-population of cells rather than the consequence of amino

113

acid limitation in the growth medium which would be expected to cause a homogenous decrease

114

across the entire population. That is, a sub-population of cells in the late transition phase culture

115

exhibited a near total inhibition of protein synthesis whereas a separate sub-population

116

maintained a noticeably higher level of protein synthesis (Figure 1C, gray).

117

We speculated that a mechanism known to control growth rate might be important for the

118

shutdown of protein synthesis in post-exponential growth. An attractive candidate is (p)ppGpp, a

119

molecule involved in regulating diverse processes that affect cells growing under sub-optimal

120

conditions (Potrykus et al., 2011). Furthermore, many bacteria synthesize (p)ppGpp when they

121

depart from exponential phase (Boes et al., 2008; Murray et al., 2003). To investigate the possible

122

role of (p)ppGpp, we utilized a strain that lacks (p)ppGpp via genetic deletion of the three known

123

B. subtilis (p)ppGpp synthetases, relA, sasA, and sasB (Nanamiya et al., 2008; Srivatsan et al.,

124

2008), which we will refer to as (p)ppGpp0. Under our growth conditions, the (p)ppGpp0 strain

125

grows equivalently to the parent wildtype strain during exponential phase as well as early and late

126

transition phase. As above, we assayed protein synthesis of the (p)ppGpp0 strain by measuring

127

OPP incorporation. Exponential phase OPP incorporation of this strain is indistinguishable from

128

the parent (Figure 1B, C). In contrast, early in transition phase, some wildtype cells incorporate

129

substantially less OPP than (p)ppGpp0 cells. This trend continues and at a time point late in

130

transition phase there are significantly less (p)ppGpp0 cells (blue) which have decreased their

131

protein synthesis compared to the wildtype parent (gray) (Figure 1B, C; Figure S2A, B). Thus,

132

(p)ppGpp is necessary for the observed inhibition of protein synthesis during late transition phase

133

even though cells lacking (p)ppGpp do not display a different growth rate up to this point.

134
135

(p)ppGpp is sufficient to inhibit protein synthesis

136

Since (p)ppGpp0 cells failed to decrease protein synthesis during the transition phase, we

137

investigated whether production of (p)ppGpp is sufficient to inhibit protein synthesis. The B.

138

subtilis (p)ppGpp synthetase sasA was placed under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter in

139

a strain lacking RelA, the bifunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase and hydrolase, as well the accessory

140

(p)ppGpp synthetases SasA and SasB. As previously observed (Tagami et al., 2012), induction

141

of sasA in the presence of these mutations results in a decrease in growth rate which culminates

142

in cessation of growth (Figure 2A). To determine how (p)ppGpp affects protein synthesis, cells

143

were labeled with OPP at 30-minute time intervals following xylose addition. At the time of addition

144

(T0), there is not a significant difference in protein synthesis between the induced and un-induced

145

cultures. However, at 30 minutes following inducer addition (T30) and at later times (T60, T90),

146

protein synthesis is significantly reduced in the induced cultures as compared to the un-induced

147

cultures (Figure 2B, C).

148
149

(p)ppGpp inhibits translation in vivo

150

We reasoned that measuring both the synthesis of a single protein and the transcription of its

151

gene would allow us to definitively demonstrate that inhibition of protein synthesis was due to

152

inhibition of translation not transcription. We chose the B. subtilis Pveg promoter which is

153

insensitive to (p)ppGpp (Krasny and Gourse, 2004) and firefly luciferase as a reporter protein

154

because its half-life in B. subtilis is only 6 minutes (Mirouze et al., 2011), so measurements of its

155

activity closely reflect the kinetics of its synthesis. We grew strains that contained an inducible

156

copy of sasA (Pxyl-sasA) as well the Pveg-luc reporter and compared luciferase activity in the

157

presence and absence of inducer. While luciferase activity is easily detected during exponential

158

growth, sasA induction is quickly followed by a drastic decrease in the luciferase activity per cell

159

as compared to cells in the absence of induction (Figure 3A). This decrease in luciferase activity

160

does not occur at the level of transcription as the level of luc mRNA on a per cell level is similar

161

in the induced and un-induced cultures (Figure 3B). Furthermore, this decrease is not dependent

162

on changes in levels of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) which would affect ribosome abundance

163

(Figure 3B). Thus, (p)ppGpp is sufficient to decrease synthesis of a particular protein without

164

affecting transcription of its mRNA, consistent with a direct effect on translation.

165
166

(p)ppGpp inhibits translation in vitro

167

We extended these in vivo observations to in vitro experiments using the PURExpress in vitro

168

reconstituted, coupled transcription-translation system (NEB) which utilizes a defined mix of

169

purified transcription and translation components to transcribe and translate a specific mRNA

170

(Shimizu et al., 2014). Addition of ppGpp to PURExpress reactions inhibited synthesis of a

171

reporter protein (CotE) in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 4). Concentrations of ppGpp

172

sufficient to significantly inhibit CotE synthesis (~1 mM) are similar to levels of (p)ppGpp observed

173

during stringent response induction in E. coli (Buckstein et al., 2008). qRT-PCR analysis

174

demonstrated that ppGpp had no effect on cotE transcription at levels where CotE synthesis was

175

significantly impaired (Figure S3), consistent with the known insensitivity of the T7 RNA

176

polymerase used in the PURExpress reaction to ppGpp (Friesen and Fiil, 1973). Thus, similar to

177

the in vivo data (Figure 3), these in vitro data demonstrate that ppGpp directly inhibits translation.

178
179

IF2 is a target of (p)ppGpp

180

Given these observations, we wished to identify the component(s) of the translation machinery

181

that is (are) targeted by ppGpp. The translational GTPases EF-Tu, EF-G and IF2 as well as the

182

ribosome associated GTPases including Obg (Buglino et al., 2002; Feng et al., 2014), RsgA

183

(Corrigan et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018), RbgA (Corrigan et al., 2016; Pausch et al., 2018), Era

184

(Corrigan et al., 2016), and HflX (Corrigan et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018) have all been reported

185

to bind (p)ppGpp. However, (p)ppGpp inhibits protein synthesis by the PURExpress system

186

(Figure 4), which contains only IF2, EF-Tu, and EF-G, so inhibition of one or more of these

187

proteins is likely sufficient to account for the in vivo inhibitory effect of (p)ppGpp on translation.

188

Initiation is a key point of translational control during nutrient limitation in yeast cells

189

(Hinnebusch, 2005) and since ppGpp inhibits IF2 in vitro (Legault et al., 1972; Milon et al., 2006),

190

we first investigated whether IF2 was a target of (p)ppGpp under our conditions. To do this, we

191

attempted to identify mutations in IF2 that would affect (p)ppGpp binding without disrupting GTP

192

binding sufficiently to impair normal function. This goal was inspired by the demonstration that

193

replacing the B. subtilis GTP synthesis enzyme GMK that is sensitive to (p)ppGpp with the E. coli

194

homolog that is insensitive to (p)ppGpp altered the B. subtilis physiological response to elevated

195

(p)ppGpp levels (Liu et al., 2015). However, the G1-G3 motifs of the G domain that interact with

196

GTP are nearly identical between E. coli and B. subtilis IF2 (Verstraeten et al., 2011), so a total

197

allele substitution strategy seemed unlikely to be similarly informative for IF2. Alternatively, E. coli

198

EF-G and IF2 have differential affinity for (p)ppGpp (Mitkevich et al., 2010) and similar but not as

199

extensively conserved G domains such that, if we could identify residue(s) that affect this

200

difference, this information might allow us to construct a B. subtilis IF2 allele less sensitive to

201

(p)ppGpp.

202

We focused on those IF2 residues which display a shift in NMR spectra upon binding of

203

ppGpp as compared to GDP (Figure 5B, blue residues) (Milon et al., 2006) since GDP interacts

204

with multiple residues in the G domain of IF2 (Wienk et al., 2012). We aligned the region

205

containing those residues (i.e., the G1 motif) with the homologous region in EF-G, which has

206

lower affinity for (p)ppGpp than IF2 (Figure 5A). We noted that one of the blue residues in IF2,

207

Gly-226, is an alanine residue (Ala-18) in EF-G (Figure 5B, red). In addition, the histidine residue

208

(His-230) in IF2 that is adjacent to the two blue residues is an alanine (Ala-21) in EF-G (Figure

209

5B, red). These differences suggested that substituting the IF2 residues with the corresponding

210

residues found in EF-G would affect the ability of IF2 to bind (p)ppGpp. We therefore compared

211

the affinity of wild type and mutant IF2 for radiolabeled (p)ppGpp using the DRaCALA filter binding

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/807917; this version posted October 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

212

assay and observed that the double mutant IF2 (G226A H230A) bound (p)ppGpp significantly

213

less well than the wildtype protein (Figure 5C).

214

To test the functional consequence of mutating these residues in B. subtilis IF2, we used

215

a PURExpress kit that lacks IF2 (DIF2). We first confirmed that the DIF2 kit, which contains purified

216

E. coli translation factors, works equivalently whether the added IF2 is derived from E. coli or B.

217

subtilis (Figure S4B). When supplied as the sole source of IF2 in this reaction, the double mutant

218

B. subtilis IF2 produced an equivalent amount of protein as wild type IF2 (Figure S4B)

219

demonstrating that the slight reduction in GTP binding (Figure S4A) did not substantially affect

220

IF2 function in translation. However, the double mutant B. subtilis IF2 was significantly less

221

sensitive than its wild type counterpart to ppGpp (Figure 5D). Taken together, these results

222

indicate that ppGpp binding to IF2 accounts for a substantial portion of the inhibition of translation

223

by ppGpp.

224
225

ppGpp fails to allosterically activate IF2 for rapid subunit joining

226

During 30S IC assembly, IF2 promotes binding of initiator tRNA (fMet-tRNAfMet) to the 30S subunit

227

and uses its domain IV (dIV) to directly contact the N-formyl-methionine and aminoacyl acceptor

228

stem of fMet-tRNAfMet, resulting in formation of an IF2-tRNA sub-complex on the intersubunit

229

surface of the 30S IC (Simonetti et al., 2008). Subsequently, the presence of GTP in the G domain

230

and recognition of fMet-tRNAfMet by dIV ‘activate’ 30S IC-bound IF2 for rapid subunit joining

231

(Pavlov et al., 2011). Using an IF2-tRNA single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer

232

(smFRET) signal that reports on the formation and conformational dynamics of the IF2-tRNA sub-

233

complex (Wang et al., 2015), we have previously demonstrated that activation of IF2 for rapid

234

subunit joining involves a GTP- and fMet-tRNAfMet-dependent conformational change of IF2 that

235

results in an increase in the affinity of IF2 for the 30S IC and an increase in the rate of subunit

236

joining (Caban et al., 2017). Notably, the presence of GTP in the G domain allosterically places

237

dIV in close proximity to fMet-tRNAfMet, resulting in an IF2-tRNA sub-complex conformation

238

characterized by a distribution of FRET efficiency (EFRET) values centered at a mean EFRET value

239

(<EFRET>) of ~0.80 (Caban et al., 2017). In contrast, the presence of GDP in the G domain places

240

dIV further from fMet-tRNAfMet, resulting in an IF2-tRNA sub-complex conformation characterized

241

by an <EFRET> of ~0.60, an ~30-fold decrease in the affinity of IF2 for the 30S IC (Caban et al.,

242

2017), and a ~20-60 fold reduction in the rate of IF2-catalyzed subunit joining (Antoun et al., 2003)

243

(Antoun et al., 2004; Pavlov et al., 2011).

244

Previously, Milón and colleagues demonstrated that ppGpp inhibits the ability of IF2 to

245

catalyze 30S IC assembly and subunit joining, consequently inhibiting formation of the first

246

peptide bond in the synthesis of a protein (Milon et al., 2006). To elucidate the structural basis

247

through which (p)ppGpp inhibits these IF2 activities, we performed smFRET experiments using

248

our IF2-tRNA smFRET signal to determine whether and how ppGpp influences the binding of E.

249

coli IF2 to the E. coli 30S IC and the conformational dynamics of E. coli 30S IC-bound IF2 (Figure

250

6). We began by comparing the affinities of GTP-bound IF2 (IF2(GTP)) and ppGpp-bound IF2

251

(IF2(ppGpp)) for the 30S IC. As in our previous studies (Caban et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015),

252

EFRET versus time trajectories recorded for individual 30S ICs were observed to fluctuate between

253

a zero FRET state, corresponding to the IF2-free state of the 30S IC, and a non-zero FRET state,

254

corresponding to the IF2-bound state of the 30S IC (Figure 6, third row). Initial inspection of these

255

trajectories and the corresponding surface contour plots of the post-synchronized time evolution

256

of population FRET reveals that, while IF2(GTP) exhibits relatively long-lived and stable binding

events on the 30S IC, IF2(ppGpp) exhibits significantly shorter-lived and unstable binding events

258

on the 30S IC (Figure 6, third and fourth rows). To quantitatively compare the affinities of

259

IF2(GTP) and IF2(ppGpp) for the 30S IC, we extracted kinetic and thermodynamic parameters

260

from the smFRET data describing the binding of IF2 to the 30S IC (STAR Methods). This analysis

261

demonstrates that the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for IF2 binding to the 30S IC is ~10-

262

fold higher when IF2 is bound to ppGpp relative to GTP, demonstrating that IF2(ppGpp) has a

263

significantly lower affinity for the 30S IC compared to IF2(GTP) (Table S1).

264

We then proceeded to compare the conformations of IF2(ppGpp) and IF2(GTP) on the

265

30S IC by plotting histograms of the EFRET values observed under each condition (Figure S5).

266

These histograms exhibit two distinct peaks centered at a zero <EFRET> and non-zero <EFRET>

267

corresponding to the IF2-free and IF2-bound states of the 30S IC, respectively. Consistent with

268

our previous studies, we observed a single non-zero peak centered at an <EFRET> of ~0.80 for

269

30S IC-bound IF2(GTP), corresponding to a distance between our labeling positions of ~43 Å

270

(assuming a Förster distance, R0, of ~55 Å (Murphy et al., 2004)) (Figure S5A). In contrast, we

271

observed a single non-zero peak centered at a significantly lower <EFRET> of ~0.58 (p-value <

272

0.0005) for 30S IC-bound IF2(ppGpp), corresponding to a distance between our labeling positions

273

of ~52.5 Å, an increase of ~9.5 Å relative to the ~43 Å observed for IF2(GTP) (Figure S5B-D).

274

Notably, the EFRET distribution of 30S IC-bound IF2(ppGpp) closely resembles that of 30S IC-

275

bound IF2(GDP), in that both distributions exhibit a single non-zero peak centered at an <EFRET>

276

of ~0.60. These results demonstrate that 30S IC-bound IF2(ppGpp) exhibits a conformation

277

different from that of an IF2 that is active for rapid subunit joining (i.e., IF2(GTP)) and similar to

278

that of an IF2 that is inactive for rapid subunit joining (i.e., IF2(GDP)).

279
280

(p)ppGpp binding to IF2 mediates translational inhibition during transition phase

281

Our identification of an IF2 allele that is less sensitive to (p)ppGpp in vitro enabled us to test our

282

initial hypothesis that accumulation of (p)ppGpp during growth reduces protein synthesis in vivo

283

because (p)ppGpp binds IF2 and inhibits its function in translation. We generated a B. subtilis

284

strain carrying a single copy of IF2 (infB) containing the double mutations (G226A, H230A) that

285

in vitro reduce ppGpp binding without substantially inhibiting IF2 function (Figure 5C; Figure

286

S4B). This strain grows equivalently to the wildtype parent throughout all phases of growth,

287

validating that the mutant IF2 is functional in vivo (Figure S6A). We first tested how these

288

mutations affect protein synthesis during late transition phase since in the wildtype background,

289

protein synthesis is strongly inhibited in a subpopulation of cells during this period (Figure 1C).

290

Mutations in IF2 that affect its binding to (p)ppGpp appear to significantly attenuate this phenotype

291

(Figure 7 A, B; Figure S6 B, C). This attenuation is similar to that observed in the complete

292

absence of (p)ppGpp (Figure 1C), suggesting it is due to the direct interaction of (p)ppGpp with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/807917; this version posted October 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

293

IF2. Thus, these data indicate that during transition phase, (p)ppGpp binding to IF2 is sufficient

294

to substantially inhibit translation.

295
296

Discussion

297

Here, we demonstrate that protein synthesis is actively attenuated in B. subtilis during the

298

transition phase of growth, initially resulting in a subpopulation of cells that are deficient in protein

299

synthesis. The alarmone (p)ppGpp is both necessary and sufficient for this phenomenon and acts

300

through a mechanism that is, at least in part, a direct effect on the translational GTPase IF2. Thus,

301

this regulatory mechanism of endogenous (p)ppGpp synthesis mediates the downregulation of

302

the most energy-consuming process in cells as they enter quiescence.

303

Although the function of (p)ppGpp under basal (non-stringent) conditions has not been

304

extensively investigated, loss of (p)ppGpp in E. faecalis leads to broad changes in physiology

305

without stringent response activation (Gaca et al., 2013). More directly relevant to the present

306

observations is the finding that the global translation rate per cell under basal conditions is

307

elevated in a S. elongatus strain lacking the Rel (p)ppGpp synthetase (Puszynska and O'Shea,

308

2017). (p)ppGpp synthesis is also relevant to physiological situations including survival of

309

pathogenic (Stapels et al., 2018) and commensal bacteria (Schofield et al., 2018). “Persisters”

310

are rare bacterial cells in populations with increased tolerance to antibiotics that are thought to be

311

characterized by relatively higher levels of (p)ppGpp (Hauryliuk et al., 2015). While the basis for

312

this heterogeneity is not understood, an interesting question raised by our observations is whether

313

the increased antibiotic tolerance of these cells is, at least in part, a consequence of the (p)ppGpp-

314

dependent inhibition of protein synthesis.

315

We show that the (p)ppGpp sensitivity of IF2 can be altered by a specific double mutation

316

in the G1 motif of the G domain, the site of (p)ppGpp binding (Milon et al., 2006). There are

317

numerous examples of other ribosome associated GTPases that bind (p)ppGpp such as ObgE

318

(Buglino et al., 2002; Feng et al., 2014; Persky et al., 2009), BipA (Kumar et al., 2015), RbgA

319

(Corrigan et al., 2016; Pausch et al., 2018), HflX (Corrigan et al., 2016) and Era (Corrigan et al.,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/807917; this version posted October 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

320

2016). Many of these reports demonstrate that (p)ppGpp binding affects their in vitro function in

321

aspects of protein synthesis, such as ribosome assembly. A critical question, however, is

322

assessing the implications of (p)ppGpp binding for the in vivo function of these proteins. Our

323

demonstration that point mutations in IF2 affect (p)ppGpp binding and subsequent in vitro (Figure

324

5) and in vivo function (Figure 7) suggests that introducing similar mutations into the highly

325

conserved G1 motif of other GTPases might be informative. Interestingly, a similar mutagenic

326

strategy was reported very recently for the E. coli PurF glutamine amido-phoaphoribotransferease

327

where a single point mutation yielded a protein that was insensitive to ppGpp inhibition (Wang et

328

al., 2019).

329

Our studies also reveal the structural basis through which ppGpp targets IF2 to inhibit

330

translation initiation. We find that ppGpp stabilizes a conformation of IF2 that is different from that

331

which is stabilized by GTP, resulting in a reduced affinity of IF2(ppGpp) relative to IF2(GTP) for

332

the 30S IC. Given that IF2 promotes the binding of fMet-tRNAfMet to the 30S subunit during 30S

333

IC assembly and subsequently accelerates subunit joining (Antoun et al., 2006), one way in which

334

ppGpp may interfere with these activities is by decreasing the affinity of IF2 for the 30S IC and

335

consequently reducing the fraction of 30S ICs harboring IF2. Notably, even when bound to the

336

30S IC, IF2(ppGpp) exhibits a conformation that differs from the conformation of IF2(GTP) that is

337

active for rapid subunit joining. Thus, in addition to lowering the fraction of 30S ICs harboring IF2,

338

our results indicate that ppGpp fails to allosterically activate 30S IC-bound IF2 for rapid subunit

339

joining. Specifically, in the ppGpp-bound conformation of IF2, the distance between our labeling

340

positions on dIV of IF2 and fMet-tRNAfMet is ~9.5 Å longer than in the GTP-bound conformation of

341

IF2. These results suggest that dIV and the N-formyl-methionine and aminoacyl acceptor stem of

342

fMet-tRNAfMet are unable to form the same number and/or strength of stabilizing interactions in

343

the presence of ppGpp that they make in the presence of GTP. Consequently, ppGpp may

344

interfere with the formation and/or stabilization of the IF2-tRNA sub-complex on the 30S IC, the

345

formation of which has been shown in structural studies to play a key role in stabilizing the binding

346

and/or positioning of fMet-tRNAfMet on the 30S IC (Julian et al., 2011; Simonetti et al., 2008). In

347

our previous smFRET study, we demonstrated that recognition of the N-formyl-methionine and

348

aminoacyl acceptor stem by dIV of IF2 was crucial for the allosteric activation of IF2(GTP), thereby

349

enabling IF2 to catalyze rapid subunit joining (Caban et al., 2017). Thus, combined with the

350

decreased affinity of IF2(ppGpp) for the 30S IC, our results suggest that the conformation of 30S

351

IC-bound IF2(ppGpp) directly interferes with the ability of IF2 to promote rapid subunit joining to

352

the 30S IC.

353

It is notable that the affinity of IF2(ppGpp) for the 30S IC and the conformation of 30S IC-

354

bound IF2(ppGpp) are similar to those which we have reported for IF2(GDP) (Caban et al.,

355

2017).Consistent with these similarities, Milón and colleagues have demonstrated that ppGpp

356

and GDP establish the same hydrogen bonding network within the G-nucleotide binding pocket

357

of IF2, resulting in very similar structures for the ppGpp- and GDP-bound G domains of IF2 (Milon

358

et al., 2006). In terms of the activities of IF2, neither ppGpp or GDP are able to effectively stabilize

359

the binding (Vinogradova et al., 2019) and/or positioning of fMet-tRNAfMet on the 30S IC and

360

catalyze rapid subunit joining. These similarities suggest that the mechanism through which

361

ppGpp inhibits the activity of IF2 is through stabilizing the factor in an inactive conformation that

362

is similar to that stabilized by GDP, thereby interfering with the activities of IF2 during translation

363

initiation.

364

The present study raises several questions. First, what is the source of the observed

365

heterogeneity of protein synthesis in single cells (Figure 1)? One possibility is heterogeneity in

366

sasA and/or sasB expression resulting in different levels of (p)ppGpp across the population.

367

Recently, it was observed that rare cells in exponential growth have high levels of sasA expression

368

with concomitant physiological effects including induction of (p)ppGpp-dependent genes and

369

enhanced antibiotic tolerance (Libby et al., 2019). However, the frequency of these cells in a

370

population (~1%) is much too low to account for the observed heterogeneity. The roughly bimodal

371

character of the heterogeneity (Figure 1C) suggests that it is an example of bistability (Dubnau

372

and Losick, 2006), a phenomenon often attributed to regulatory network architecture, specifically

373

the presence of positive non-linear autoregulation or two mutually repressive repressors (Ferrell,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/807917; this version posted October 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

374

2002). It is therefore intriguing to note that SasB (but not SasA) is subject to positive allosteric

375

regulation (Steinchen et al., 2018) which could generate a sharp threshold-like response such as

376

has been characterized with E. coli RelA (Shyp et al., 2012). Furthermore, sasB is expressed

377

during early transition phase (Tagami et al., 2012). Thus, the potential role of sasB in the

378

heterogeneity of protein synthesis (Figure 1) will be the subject future investigation.

379

Second, is IF2 the only target of (p)ppGpp? The in vitro translation experiment using the

380

double mutant IF2 (Figure 5D) suggests that there may be residual inhibition that is not IF2-

381

dependent. One possible additional target is EF-Tu (Hamel and Cashel, 1974) and the in vitro

382

affinity of EF-Tu for (p)ppGpp is similar to that of IF2 (Mitkevich et al., 2010). Consistent with EF-

383

Tu being a target, residues in IF2 that are important for its (p)ppGpp sensitivity are conserved in

384

EF-Tu. Thus, characterization of EF-Tu mutant alleles carrying mutations similar to the IF2 double

385

mutant with reduced sensitivity to (p)ppGpp could provide insight of the role of EF-Tu in the down-

386

regulation of protein synthesis during post-exponential growth.

387

Third, how is (p)ppGpp-mediated inhibition reversed? Conserved proteins capable of

388

hydrolyzing (p)ppGpp have been identified in many bacterial species (Atkinson et al., 2011; Irving

389

and Corrigan, 2018). In B. subtilis, the Rel protein is a bi-functional (p)ppGpp synthetase and

390

hydrolase. Although the regulation of the synthetase activity is well understood, regulation of the

391

hydrolase activity remains understudied. Binding of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) to the

392

Rhodobacter capsulatus Rel protein stimulates (p)ppGpp hydrolysis (Fang and Bauer, 2018).

393

Since the key residue important for BCAA binding is conserved in B. subtilis RelA, this mechanism

Although we have shown that (p)ppGpp-dependent inhibition of translational initiation

401

stationary phase (Deutscher, 2003; Piir et al., 2011) which would be expected to decrease overall

402

protein synthesis. However, recent work suggests that ribosomes are actually in excess, and that

403

only a fraction are active, especially under non-exponential growth (Dai et al., 2016; Li et al.,

404

2018). This excess would be particularly useful for the exit from quiescence, since the ability to

405

transition to maximal protein synthesis as quickly as possible would provide a clear selective

406

advantage (Korem Kohanim et al., 2018; Remigi et al., 2019). From this perspective, a reversible

407

process such as the competitive binding of an inhibitor such as (p)ppGpp to a translational

408

GTPase would facilitate the necessary down-regulation of protein synthesis to minimize energy

409

consumption without impairing an optimal response to growth-permissive conditions.

517

Strain JDB 4297 was generated using a standard transformation protocol with pSD54 at 37°C.

518

Following transformation, cells were plated on selective media and grown overnight at 45°C. Two

519

transformants were grown for approximately 8 hours in LB without selection at 25°C. These

520

cultures were then diluted 1:10 and grown overnight in LB without selection at 25°C. Overnight

521

cultures were then serially diluted and plated to isolate single colonies. Ten single colonies from

522

each plate were then checked for sensitivity to the antibiotic originally used for selection. Two

523

sensitive clones from each of the original cultures were isolated and correct integration of point

524

mutations was confirmed by sequencing PCR reactions of the region of interest.

METHOD DETAILS

551

Growth curves

552

Growth curves were performed in a Tecan Infinite m200 plate reader at 37 ºC with continuous

553

shaking and OD600 measurements were made every five minutes. Cultures were grown from

554

single colonies from fresh LB plates grown overnight at 37 ºC. Exponential phase starter cultures

555

(OD600 ~ 0.5-1.0) were diluted to OD600 = 0.01 and grown in 96-well Nunclon Delta surface clear

556

plates (Thermo Scientific) with 150 µL per well. All growth curves were done in triplicate and

557

media-only wells were used to subtract background absorbance.

559

OPP labeling

560

Click-iT Plus OPP Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (Invitrogen) was used to label cells with OPP

561

following manufacturer’s instructions. 450 µL of cells at given time points were transferred to

562

disposable glass tubes. OPP was added to a final concentration of 13 µM. Labelling was

563

performed at 37 ºC on a roller drum for 20 min and all subsequent steps were done at RT. Cells

564

were harvested by centrifugation at 16K RCF for 1 min and re-suspended in 100 µL of 3.7%

565

formaldehyde in PBS for fixation. Cells were fixed for 10 min, harvested, and permeabilized using

566

100 µL of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Cells were labelled using 100 µL of 1X Click-iT

567

cocktail for 20 min in the dark. Cells were harvested and washed one time using Click-iT rinse

568

buffer and then re-suspended in 20-40 µL of PBS for imaging or in 150 µL of PBS for fluorescence

569

measurement on a Tecan Infinite m200 plate reader in 96-well flat bottom White sided plates

570

(Greiner Bio-One). Images were analyzed using Image J.

571
572

Luminescence growth curves

573

Cultures were grown in LB from single colonies grown overnight at 37 ºC on LB plates. Cultures

574

in exponential phase (OD600 ~ 0.5-1.0) were diluted to OD600 = 0.1 in 150 µL LB containing 4.7

575

mM D-luciferin (Goldbio) and grown in a 96-well flat bottom white sided plates (Greiner Bio-One)

576

plates in triplicate. OD600 and luminescence measurements were made every five min using a

577

Tecan Infinite m200 plate reader and media only wells were used to subtract background.

578
579

RNA quantification

580

RNA was quantified from cultures grown in LB as above. At given time points 14 mL of the cultures

581

were pelleted at 8 K RCF for 10 minutes at room temperature and frozen at -80 ºC. Pellets were

582

re-suspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen) to match based on OD600. ~ 5 OD600 units of all cultures were

583

lysed using a FastPrep 24 5G (MP Biomedicals). Lysates were spun down at 20 K RCF for 20

584

min and RNA was extracted using the Direct-Zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research). RNA

585

samples were DNAse I treated following manufactures protocol (NEB) and 1 µg of RNA was used

586

to generate cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems).

587

cDNAs were diluted 1:200 and used as templates for qPCR. qPCRs were preformed using SYBR

588

green. Primers were design using the PrimeQuest Tool (IDT). No cDNA and no RT controls were

589

used to ensure signal was specific to desired RNAs.

590
591

in vitro translation assays

592

Translation assays used the PURExpress system (NEB) following the manufacture’s protocol and

593

a plasmid encoding a CotE-FLAG fusion protein as template DNA (Pereira et al., 2015). ppGpp

594

(TriLink Biotechnologies) at the specified concentrations was added to translation reactions.

595

Reactions were run for 20 min each at 37 ºC and stopped by adding 2X SDS loading buffer.

596

Synthesized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes and

597

visualized by probing with an anti-FLAG HRP antibody (Sigma). Mutant IF2 was assayed using

598

a ∆IF123 PURExpress kit (NEB) supplemented with equal concentrations of purified E. coli IF1

599

and IF3. Reactions were run essentially as above but 0.47 µM of either WT or mutant B. subtilis

600

IF2 was added to each reaction as the sole source of IF2. WT and mutant IF2s were purified as

601

previously described (Fei et al., 2010). Band intensities were analyzed using ImageJ.

602
603

DRaCALA binding assays

604

Radiolabeled (p)ppGpp was generated essentially as described (Corrigan et al., 2016). Briefly,

605

purified E. coli RelA N-terminal mutant protein (amino acids 1-455) was incubated overnight at

606

30ºC with [a-32P]- GTP (PerkinElmer) in 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 15 mM MgOAc, 60 mM KOAc, 30 mM

607

NH4OAc, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM PMSF. Reactions were supplemented with 8 mM cold ATP.

608

Conversion of GTP to (p)ppGpp (>90%) was monitored by thin layer chromatography on PEI-

609

cellulose plates in 1.5 M KH2PO4 (pH 3.6). DRaCALA binding assays were carried out essentially

610

as described (Corrigan et al., 2016; Roelofs et al., 2011). 6 µM protein was incubated with 55.5

611

nM [a-32P]-labeled (p)ppGpp in 40 mM Tris (pH 8), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2mM PMSF.

612

Reactions were incubated for 5 min at RT and 2.5 µL of each reaction was spotted onto

613

nitrocellulose membranes and dried completely at RT. Spots were exposed for 30 min on a

614

phosphor storage screen and visualized (GE Typhoon). Inner and outer ring intensities were

615

quantified using ImageJ. Reactions where protein was not added were used to subtract

616

background.

618

smFRET experiments

619

All of the E. coli components for assembling 30S ICs, including 30S ribosomal subunits, 5’-

620

biotinylated mRNA, Cyanine (Cy) 3-labeled fMet-tRNAfMet (labeled with maleimide-derivatized Cy3

621

at the naturally occurring 4-thiouridine at residue position 8), IF1, and Cy5-labeled IF2 (labeled

622

with maleimide-derivatized Cy5 at an engineered cysteine at residue position 810) were prepared

623

as previously described (Caban et al., 2017). 30S ICs lacking IF2 and IF3 were assembled by

624

combining 0.6 μM 30S subunits, 1.8 μM 5’-biotinylated mRNA, 0.8 μM Cy3-labeled fMet-tRNAfMet,

625

and 0.9 μM IF1 in Tris-Polymix Buffer (50 mM Tris-OAc (pHRT = 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM NH4OAc,

626

5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM putrescine-HCl, 1 mM spermidine-free base, and 6 mM β-

627

mercaptoethanol). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes then on ice for an additional

628

5 minutes. Small aliquots of 30S ICs were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C.

629

To conduct smFRET experiments, 30S ICs assembled were first diluted to a final

630

concentration of 75 pM in the presence of 2 uM IF1, 25 nM Cy5-labeled IF2, and 1 mM GTP or

631

ppGpp. 30S ICs were then tethered to the polyethylene glycol (PEG)/biotin-PEG-derivatized

632

surface of a microfluidic observation flowcell using a biotin-streptavidin-biotin between the 5’-

633

biotinylated mRNA and the biotin-PEG. Untethered 30S ICs were flushed from the flowcell, and

634

tethered 30S ICs were buffer exchanged, by washing the flowcell with Imaging Buffer (Tris-

635

Polymix Buffer with an oxygen scavenging system composed of 2.5 mM 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic

636

acid (PCA) and 250 mM protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (PCD) and a triplet-state quencher

637

cocktail composed of 8.4 mM 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene (COT) and 8.7 mM 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol

638

(NBA)) supplemented with 2 uM IF1, 25 nM Cy5-labeled IF2, and 1 mM GTP or ppGpp in order

639

to enable rebinding of these components to 30SICs from which they might dissociates during the

640

course of imaging. Finally, 30S ICs were imaged at single-molecule resolution and at a 0.1 sec

641

per frame acquisition time using a laboratory-built, prism-based total internal reflection

642

fluorescence (TIRF) microscope as previously described (Caban et al., 2017). A previously

643

described approach (Desai and Gonzalez, 2019) was used to identify fluorophores and classify

644

them into ‘fluorophore’ or ‘background’ classes; align the Cy3 and Cy5 imaging channels; fit

645

individual Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophore to 2D Gaussians and estimate and, in the case of Cy5,

646

bleedthrough correct the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence emission intensity versus time trajectories;

647

and generate the EFRET versus time trajectories. Only those trajectories exhibiting a signal-to-

648

background (SBR) of 3.5:1 or greater as well as single-step photobleaching of Cy3 within the

649

observation time were selected for further analyses.

650

In order to estimate the rate constants for the association of IF2 with the 30S IC (ka) and

651

for the dissociation of IF2 from the 30S IC (kd) we began by estimating a ‘consensus’ hidden

652

Markov model (HMM) of the EFRET versus time trajectories using a slight extension of the

653

variational Bayes approach we introduced in the vbFRET algorithm (Bronson et al., 2009) Briefly,

654

instead of using a likelihood function for each EFRET versus time trajectory, we used a single

655

likelihood function that simultaneously includes all of the EFRET versus time trajectories in a dataset

656

to arrive at a log-likelihood function given by

657

ln (ℒ) =

)

ln (ℒ* )

Eq. 1

* ∈ ,-./01,2-*03

658

where ℒ* is the variational approximation of the likelihood function for a single trajectory. A further

659

development of this approach in a hierarchical context underlies the hFRET algorithm that we

660

have recently reported(Hon and Gonzalez, 2019). Using this consensus HMM approach, we

661

estimated HMMs for 1-6 states and performed model selection using the highest evidence lower

662

bound (ELBO) as described in Bronson et al., 2009. In all cases, the 2-state HMM yielded the

663

highest ELBO. The transition matrix obtained from this 2-state model consists of a 2 x 2 matrix in

664

which the off-diagonal elements correspond to the number of times a transition takes place

665

between the IF2-free and the IF2-bound states of the 30S IC and the on-diagonal elements

666

correspond to the number of times a transition does not take place. The 2 rows of this matrix

667

parameterize Dirichlet distributions and, for each Dirichlet distribution, we calculated the lower

668

bounds (2.5 %) and upper bounds (97.5 %) of the transition probability using the inverse

669

cumulative distribution function of the corresponding Dirichlet distribution. These transition

670

probabilities (p) were used to calculate rate constants (k) using the equation
𝑘= −

671

ln (1 − 𝑝)
𝑡

Eq. 2

672

where t is the time between successive data points (i.e., the acquisition time) (t = 0.1 sec). Finally,

673

we calculated ka using the equation
𝑘. =

683

𝑘′.
[𝐼𝐹2]

Eq. 3

674

where k’a is the pseudo-first-order association rate constant calculated using Eq. 2 and [IF2] is

675

the concentration of IF2, and we calculated kd directly from Eq 2. The equilibrium dissociation

676

constant for IF2 binding to the 30S IS (Kd) was obtained by summing the columns of the 2 x 2

677

transition matrix to obtain the total number of data points in which the 30S IC was either in the

678

IF2-free state or the IF2-bound state. These sums can then be used to parameterize a Dirichlet

679

distribution describing the fraction of 30S ICs in the IF2-bound state (fb). The lower bounds and

680

upper bounds of fb were calculated using the inverse cumulative distribution function of this

681

Dirichlet distribution, as described above, and the Kd was calculated using the equation Kd / [IF2]

682

= (1/fb) – 1.

684
685

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

686

Western blots, DRaCALA images, and cell fluorescence intensities were quantified using ImageJ.

687

Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test unless

688

otherwise stated.

added to exponentially growing cultures of WT B. subtilis and total fluorescence was measured

694

at 10 minutes and 20 minutes post OPP addition. Increased fluorescence was detected at the 20

717

One-dimensional histograms of EFRET value distributions corresponding to the interaction of IF2

718

with the 30S IC for (A) IF2(GTP) and (B) IF2(ppGpp). Both histograms were fitted to a two-

719

Gaussian mixture model in which the Gaussian centered at the zero EFRET value corresponds to

720

the IF2-free state of the 30S IC and the Gaussian centered at the non-zero EFRET value

721

corresponds to the IF2-bound state of the 30S IC. The center of each fitted Gaussian was used

722

to determine the mean EFRET value for the corresponding state (<EFRET>). The Gaussians

723

corresponding to the IF2-free, IF2(GTP)-bound, and IF2(ppGpp)-bound states of the 30S IC had

724

<EFRET>s of ~0.0 (in both histograms), ~0.80, and ~0.58, respectively. (C) To qualitatively

compare the EFRET distributions for the IF2(GTP)-bound (orange) and IF2(ppGpp)-bound (blue)

726

states of the 30S IC, the portion of the distributions with EFRET values greater than 0.3 were

727

normalized such that the areas of the two distributions were equivalent. Although there is some

728

overlap between the distributions, the two distributions exhibit distinct <EFRET>s. (D) To

729

quantitatively demonstrate that the difference between the <EFRET>s of the two samples (i.e., the

730

IF2(GTP)-bound state of the 30S IC and the IF2(ppGpp)-bound states of the 30S IC) is statistically

731

meaningful, we randomly separated all of the EFRET versus time trajectories for each sample into

five groups, calculated the <EFRET> for each group in each sample, and conducted a two-sample

Figure 3. (p)ppGpp directly inhibits translation in vivo
Luminescence produced by a luciferase reporter protein was measured during exponential phase growth before and
after sasA expression. (A) Pxyl-sasA Pveg-luc strain (JDB4296) was grown in duplicate and 0.05% xylose was added
after 60 min of growth (T0) and growth and luminescence were measured for 90 min post induction of sasA (means
± SDs). (B) Direct inhibition of translation of the luciferase reporter was verified by measuring luc mRNA and 16S
rRNA levels both at the time of induction and a time point when the luc reporter was significantly inhibited (T0 and
T30 respectively) using RT-qPCR (means ± SDs). n.s. p > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001

Figure 5. IF2 is a target of ppGpp
IF2 was validated in vitro as a direct target of ppGpp using IF2 mutations that reduce ppGpp binding. (A)
Affinity of B. subtilis EF-G and IF2 for (p)ppGpp was compared using the differential radial capillary action
of a ligand assay (DRaCALA) (Roelofs et al., 2011). (means ± SDs). (B) Alignment of G1 domains of B. subtilis
IF2 and EF-G. Residues in blue denote those whose chemical shifts were previously identified to be most
shifted upon binding of ppGpp versus GDP. Residues in red are those that were different in EF-G versus IF2
and that were used to engineer a mutant IF2 with reduced affinity for ppGpp (G226A H230A). (C)
DRaCALA-based comparison of ppGpp affinity for WT and mutant IF2 (means ± SDs). (D) in vitro sensitivity
of WT and mutant IF2 was assessed using the PURExpress in vitro reconstituted, coupled transcriptiontranslation system (NEB). WT and mutant IF2 were added at equimolar amounts to separate PURExpress
reactions in the presence of 1mM ppGpp and protein synthesis was monitored by Western blot (means ±
SDs). n.s. p > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001

Figure 6. ppGpp inhibits IF2 function in catalyzing rapid 50S subunit joining
The binding of IF2 to the 30S IC and the conformation of 30S IC-bound IF2 in the presence of (A) GTP and
(B) ppGpp were directly observed by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET)
using an IF2-tRNA smFRET signal. First row: Cartoon representations of 30S ICs assembled using Cy3 FRET
donor fluorophore-labeled fMet-tRNAfMet and Cy5 FRET acceptor fluorophore-labeled IF2(GTP) or
IF2(ppGpp). Second row: Plots of Cy3 (green) and Cy5 (red) fluorescence emission intensity versus time
trajectories. Third row: Plots of the EFRET versus time trajectories corresponding to the plots of Cy3 and Cy5
fluorescence intensity trajectories in the second row. Fourth row: Surface contour plots of the postsynchronized time evolution of population FRET. These plots are generated by superimposing the EFRET
versus time trajectories of individual IF2 binding events such that the start of each event is computationally
post-synchronized to time = 0 sec, thereby allowing visualization of the time evolution of population FRET
for the entire population of IF2 binding events. “N” indicates the total number of individual 30S ICs
analyzed and “n” indicates the total number of individual IF2 binding events analyzed.

Figure S1. OPP does not arrest protein synthesis (Related to Figure 1)
The effect of OPP addition on protein synthesis was tested during exponential phase. OPP was added to
exponentially growing cultures of WT B. subtilis and total fluorescence was measured at 10 minutes and 20
minutes post OPP addition. Increased fluorescence was detected at the 20 minute time point compared to
10 minute time point indicating continued protein synthesis in the presence of OPP. Chloramphenicol was
added to a separate culture in combination with OPP. Decreased fluorescence indicates that OPP is sensitive
to translational inhibition (means ± SDs).

Figure S5. IF2(GTP) and IF2(ppGpp) exhibit distinct conformations when bound to the 30S IC (Related to Figure 6)
One-dimensional histograms of EFRET value distributions corresponding to the interaction of IF2 with the 30S IC for
(A) IF2(GTP) and (B) IF2(ppGpp). Both histograms were fitted to a two-Gaussian mixture model in which the
Gaussian centered at the zero EFRET value corresponds to the IF2-free state of the 30S IC and the Gaussian centered
at the non-zero EFRET value corresponds to the IF2-bound state of the 30S IC. The center of each fitted Gaussian
was used to determine the mean EFRET value for the corresponding state (<EFRET>). The Gaussians corresponding to
the IF2-free, IF2(GTP)-bound, and IF2(ppGpp)-bound states of the 30S IC had <EFRET>s of ~0.0 (in both histograms),
~0.80, and ~0.58, respectively. (C) To qualitatively compare the EFRET distributions for the IF2(GTP)-bound (orange)
and IF2(ppGpp)-bound (blue) states of the 30S IC, the portion of the distributions with EFRET values greater than 0.3
were normalized such that the areas of the two distributions were equivalent. Although there is some overlap
between the distributions, the two distributions exhibit distinct <EFRET>s. (D) To quantitatively demonstrate that
the difference between the <EFRET>s of the two samples (i.e., the IF2(GTP)-bound state of the 30S IC and the
IF2(ppGpp)-bound states of the 30S IC) is statistically meaningful, we randomly separated all of the EFRET versus
time trajectories for each sample into five groups, calculated the <EFRET> for each group in each sample, and
conducted a two-sample t-test, obtaining a p-value < 0.0005.
