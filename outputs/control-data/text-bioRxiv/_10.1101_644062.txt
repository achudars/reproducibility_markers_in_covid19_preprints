Abstract
Appendage patterning and evolution have been active areas of inquiry for
the past two centuries. While most work has centered on the skeleton,
particularly that of amniotes, the evolutionary origins and molecular
underpinnings of the neuromuscular diversity of fish appendages have
remained enigmatic. The fundamental pattern of segmentation in amniotes,
for example, is that all muscle precursors and spinal nerves enter either the
paired appendages or body wall at the same spinal level. The condition in
finned vertebrates is not understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we
investigated the development of muscles and nerves in unpaired and paired
fins of skates and compared them to those of chain catsharks. During skate
and shark embryogenesis, cell populations of muscle precursors and
associated spinal nerves at the same axial level contribute to both
appendages and body wall, perhaps representing an ancestral condition of
gnathostome appendicular neuromuscular systems. Remarkably in skates,
this neuromuscular bifurcation as well as colinear Hox expression extend
posteriorly to pattern a broad paired fin domain. In addition, we identified
migratory muscle precursors (MMPs), which are known to develop into
paired appendage muscles with Pax3 and Lbx1 gene expression, in the
dorsal fins of skates. Our results suggest that muscles of paired fins have
evolved via redeployment of the genetic program of MMPs that were already
involved in dorsal fin development. Appendicular neuromuscular systems
most likely have emerged as side branches of body wall neuromusculature
and have been modified to adapt to distinct aquatic and terrestrial habitats.

Introduction
Emergence and diversification of paired appendages are central to vertebrate
evolution (1). During evolution of paired appendages, skeletons, muscles and
nerves have been assembled to support appendage movement, but the
evolutionary trajectories and diversity of underlying genetic mechanisms of
appendicular neuromuscular patterning remain largely unknown (2).
Cartilaginous fishes, consisting of chimaeras, sharks, skates, and rays, hold
prominent phylogenetic positions in vertebrate evolution, representing primitive
conditions of paired appendages (3, 4). In addition to their significance in
evolutionary studies, cartilaginous fishes exhibit remarkably diverse paired fins.
For example, skates, rays (batoids), and angel sharks, have evolved
extraordinarily broad paired fins (5). To generate power for forward propulsion,
batoids primarily rely on undulatory movement of wide pectoral fins (6). This
motion is achieved by a unique arrangement of the skeleton, muscles, and
nerves (7). Despite their phylogenetically significant position, functional variety,
and evolutionary diversity, the developmental processes and mechanisms of
appendicular neuromusculature have not been investigated in diverse
cartilaginous fish.
In amniotes, hypaxial muscle precursors develop ventral and appendicular
musculature to emerge from the ventrolateral dermomyotome of somites during
embryogenesis (8). These muscle precursors are categorized into
subpopulations based on their positions along the anteroposterior axis (9). In
limb segments, hypaxial muscle precursors delaminate from the dermomyotome
and migrate into the limb bud as migratory muscle precursors (MMPs). At
interlimb levels, the ventral lip of the dermomyotome directly extends into the
body wall forming body wall muscles (9). Intriguingly, analysis of developmental
processes of appendage and body wall muscles in chondrichthyans and other

fish have identified differences to the condition in amniotes (10, 11). Whereas
MMPs migrate and differentiate into appendage muscles in amniotes, appendage
muscles of chondrichthyans have been argued to be derived from a direct
extension of the ventrolateral dermomyotome into the pectoral fin (12, 13). It has
also recently been shown that catsharks have delaminated MMPs entering into
the pectoral fin, a seemingly comparable mechanism with that of amniotes (10).
Furthermore in amniotes, hypaxial muscle precursors migrate exclusively either
into the body wall or paired appendages (9). In catsharks, hypaxial muscle
precursors emigrate into both (2, 10). Lacking comparative data, particularly from
cartilaginous fish, we currently do not know the phylogenetic polarity or
significance of these changes to developmental patterning.
Genetic underpinnings of appendage and body wall muscle development have
been revealed in mouse and chick embryos. At limb segments, MMPs express
the homeodomain transcription factor Lbx1 (ladybird homeobox 1). Loss of Lbx1
results in a lack of appendage muscles and MMP migration (14–16), indicating
that Lbx1 function is critical for the migratory ability of MMPs. In contrast, direct
extension of the ventrolateral dermomyotome at the interlimb level takes place
without expression of Lbx1 (9, 17). A previous study suggested that positiondependent expression of Lbx1 in hypaxial muscle precursors along the
anteroposterior axis is determined by combinations of Hox genes in mice (18).
In vertebrates, concomitant with musculature development, motoneurons (MNs)
originate from the ventral neural tube and extend to and innervate their target
muscles. Coincident with Hox expression along the anteroposterior axis, MNs
differentiate into lateral motor column neurons (LMC) that innervate paired
appendage muscles at the brachial and lumbar levels, hypaxial motor column
neurons (HMC) that innervate hypaxial muscles at the thoracic and sacral levels,
or medial motor column neurons (MMC) that regulate epaxial muscles (19). At

brachial and lumber levels, Hox6 and Hox10 genes induce high expression level
of FoxP1, a transcription factor that promotes LMC differentiation via direct
binding to its regulatory regions (20). In contrast, at the thoracic level, Hoxc9
represses FoxP1 expression and induces development of the HMC (21).
Intriguingly, skates (Leucoraja erinacea) and catsharks (Scyliorhinus canicular)
lost the HoxC cluster during evolution (22, 23). Loss of the HoxC cluster results
in high FoxP1 expression, and the through development of the LMC between
brachial and lumbar domains in skates (24). Unexpectedly, a previous study
identified a minor population of MNs that is similar to the HMC at pectoral and
pelvic domains with LMC in the neural tube of skates (24), implying that skates
retain unique patterns of innervation at the brachial level compared with other
finned vertebrates. However, developmental patterns of peripheral nerves in
skates and other rays have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
To understand how batoid neuromuscular systems arose, we investigated their
developmental patterns in skates (Leucoraja erinacea) and compared them with
chain catsharks (Scyliorhinus retifer) using whole-mount in situ hybridization and
antibody staining. These data provide molecular insights into the evolutionary
mechanisms behind the generation of diverse neuromuscular systems as well as
their evolutionary origins.
Results
Dual contribution of muscles into the body wall and pectoral fin
To understand the developmental mechanisms of cephalic and appendicular
muscles in batoids, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization for Pax3 and
Lbx1 mRNA in skate embryos. Pax3 was expressed in myoblasts of the pectoral
fin and body wall (Fig. 1A,B). Subsequent sectioning of stained embryos
confirmed Pax3 expression in the dermomyotome, myoblasts of the pectoral fin,

and ventrally extended body wall myoblasts (Supplementary Fig. 1). This dual
contribution pattern of Pax3 expression in the pectoral fins and body wall is
similar to that of shark embryos (10), although it was extended further posteriorly
in skate fins compared to shark fins. Similarly, Lbx1 expression was observed in
myoblasts of the pectoral fin, but not in the body wall, unlike Pax3 expression
(Fig.1C). This suggests that the myoblast population derived from the
dermomyotome separates into fin and body wall muscles with and without Lbx1
expression, as MMPs and muscle progenitor cells, respectively.
We next performed whole-mount immunostaining of skate embryos using myosin
heavy chain antibodies. Basic components of cephalic and appendicular muscles
were observed at stages 29 and 30 of embryonic development (Fig. 1D–O). The
constrictor branchialis, which is necessary for gill movement, developed in the
pharyngeal arches (Fig. 1D). The cucullaris, which articulates the skull and
pectoral girdle, was formed at dorsal to the pharyngeal arches and lateral to
epaxial muscles (Fig. 1D,E). Hypobranchial muscles developed at the ventral gill
region (Fig. 1G). In the pectoral fin, adductor and abductor muscles were
observed at the dorsal and ventral sides, respectively (Fig. 1E,H). Hypaxial body
wall muscles developed posteriorly from the base of the umbilical cord and
backward, consistent with Pax3 expression patterns (Fig. 1E, H, K, N). This
embryonic pattern is distinct from tetrapod musculature, in which the early
development of appendage and body wall muscles occurs exclusively along the
anteroposterior axis. Adductor and abductor muscles were formed in the pelvic
fin as well, but staining of myosin heavy chain was weaker than those of the
pectoral fin at stage 29 (Fig. 1F,I). At stage 30, abductor and adductor muscle
staining was stronger and extended to the distal tip of pectoral and pelvic fins
compared to stage 29 (Fig. 1K,N,L,O).

Branching of spinal nerves into the body wall and pectoral fins
A previous study reported that the localization of LMC neurons expands
posteriorly in the neural tube of skates (24). However, the peripheral innervation
pattern of batoid spinal nerves during embryogenesis has not been studied in
detail. To investigate developmental patterns of skate nerves, we used a 3A10
antibody that recognizes neurofilament-associated proteins. In contrast to the
contribution of Sp nerves 5-8 into the pectoral appendage in mice (25), Sp
nerves 1–32 innervated into the pectoral fin muscles in skate (Fig. 2A).
Particularly, Sp nerves 1–10 developed the brachial plexus and innervated
anterior pectoral fin muscles (Fig. 2A–C). In the posterior part of the pectoral fin,
Sp nerves bifurcated at the base of the pectoral fin; one branch innervated body
wall muscles (ventral branch of Sp nerves) and the other branch entered pectoral
fin muscles at the same axial level (pectoral nerve) (Fig. 2D). After entering into
the pectoral fin, pectoral nerves branched into dorsal and ventral domains for
adductor and abductor muscles, respectively. In contrast to the previous study,
however, we did not confirm a contribution of Oc nerves into pectoral fin muscles.
Similar to pectoral nerves, Sp nerves 33–48 branched and innervated into the
pelvic fins and body wall (Fig. 2A,E).
At stage 31, Sp nerves established a brachial plexus-like structure in addition to
the brachial plexus of Sp nerves 1–10 at the middle of the pectoral fin. Dorsal and
ventral fin muscles were also innervated by Sp nerves at this stage (Fig. 2F,G).
The plexus-like nerve bundle may be indispensable to innervate into the pectoral
fin through the pectoral girdle. The posterior pectoral fin was innervated by Sp
nerves that branched at the base of the fins and extended into the body wall and
pectoral fin without forming plexus structures.

Conserved developmental pattern of muscles and nerves in
chondrichthyans
Our results showed that myoblast population and spinal nerves contribute into
both the pectoral fin and body wall at the same vertebrae level during skate
embryogenesis (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). A previous study identified the similar
migratory pattern of myoblasts in catsharks (10). To further compare
developmental patterns of pectoral fin muscles and nerves of skates with those
of sharks, we used myosin heavy chain antibodies to stain developing muscles
and nerves in chain catshark embryos (Scyliorhinus retifer). At stage 30, staining
confirmed abductor and adductor muscles in the pectoral fin (Supplementary Fig.
2). In the trunk, hypaxial body wall muscles developed at the same axial level as
the pectoral fin muscles (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, Sp nerves 7–16
bifurcated into the body wall and pectoral fin without forming a plexus structure at
stage 28 (Fig. 2I,J).
To confirm peripheral structures of Sp nerves, we stained serial sections of skate
and shark embryos from stages 29 to 32 with hematoxylin and eosin solutions.
After photographing serial sections, we reconstructed the original 3D morphology
of muscles and nerves by using Amira software (Materials and Methods). 3D
reconstruction of skate and shark embryos showed that Sp nerves that originated
from the ventral root of neural tube innervated both pectoral fin and body wall
muscles peripherally, indicating that they contain motor nerves that regulate
movement of body wall and pectoral fin muscles (Fig. 2H and K). Collectively,
these results suggest that skates and sharks retain comparable developmental
patterns of neuromuscular systems, in which muscles and nerves contribute into
both the paired appendages and body wall at the same vertebrae level, and
batoids have posteriorly extended this dual contribution compared with sharks,
supporting movement of their exceptionally wide fins.

Dynamic rearrangements of Hox expression patterns in skates
Previous studies have revealed evolutionary diversity of MNs for paired
appendages of elephant sharks, skates, and zebrafish (24, 26). However, the
molecular mechanisms that coordinate evolution of appendage muscles, nerves,
and skeletons remains unknown. Particularly in skates, development of the
pectoral fin initiates from a strikingly wide fin bud that derives from the lateral
plate mesoderm (LPM) (27, 28). Subsequently, muscles and nerves enter the
enlarged pectoral fin bud from wider domains of the paraxial mesoderm (PAM)
and neural tube along the anteroposterior axis compared with shark embryos.
This observation led us to hypothesize that vertebrates have mechanisms that
coordinate development of muscles, nerves, and skeletons to support
appendage movement.
To understand the genetic mechanisms involved in co-evolution of muscles,
nerves, and skeletons in skate, we investigated gene expression patterns of Fgf8
(fibroblast growth factor 8), Wnt3, Cyp26a1 (cytochrome P450 26a1), and Cdx2,
which provide anteroposterior positional information during gastrulation and
specify prospective limb regions (29–31). Expression patterns of these genes at
stage 23 did not differ remarkably from those of other vertebrates at the
comparable stage (Fig. 3 A–D). To further explore the genetic mechanisms for
co-evolution, we tested expression patterns of Hox genes which provide
positional information along the anteroposterior axis during gastrulation (32, 33)
as the downstream targets of Fgf8, Wnt3, Cyp26a1 and Cdx2 in skates.
Consistent with Hox expression patterns of catsharks (34), Hoxa2, Hoxa3,
Hoxa4, Hoxd1, Hoxd3 and Hoxd4 were expressed from the rhombomeres to the
caudal tip of neural tube (Fig. 3E,F,G,M,N,O,Q). However, comparison of the
anterior limit of Hoxa9, Hoxa10, Hoxa11, and Hoxd8 expression showed that
their expression domains shifted posteriorly in the neural tube of skates
compared to catsharks (34) (Fig. 3I,J,K,P,Q, Materials and Methods). In the PAM

of skate embryos, expression domains of Hoxa9, Hoxa10, and Hoxa11 also
shifted posteriorly from that of sharks (Fig. 3I,J,K,Q). Furthermore, in skate LPM,
Hoxa4, Hoxd4, and Hoxa5, which are capable of inducing Tbx5 expression via
direct binding to regulatory regions in mice (35), exhibited broader expression
domains than in sharks and other tetrapods (Fig. 3G,H,O,Q). These results show
that dynamic rearrangements of Hox expression patterns have occurred in the
neural tube, PAM, and LPM of skates.
To test the effects of rearrangements of Hox expression patterns on the
development of pectoral fins in skates, we cultured skate embryos with retinoic
acid (RA), which alters Hox expression patterns (36), from stage 23 to 30 (Fig. 3
R-U). Pectoral fins of embryos cultured with RA were narrower than control
embryos along the anteroposterior axis (9/10 embryos; Fig. 3R,S and
Supplementary Fig. 3), creating a thoracic domain between pectoral and pelvic
fins. RA–treated embryos lost the brachial plexus (Fig. 3T) and the branching
pattern of pectoral nerves— Sp nerves directly innervated the pectoral fin from
the neural tube (Fig.3U). These results suggest that Hox expression is
responsible for regulating the width of skate fins, plexus formation, and
innervation patterns.
MMPs in dorsal fin development
While developmental processes of pectoral muscles and nerves have been
investigated in multiple fish taxa (2, 37), evolutionary origins of the
developmental programs for neuromuscular systems in paired appendages
remain unexplored. Therefore, we investigated Pax3 expression that represents
muscle precursor cells by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Pax3 is expressed
weakly at the proximal base of 1st and 2nd dorsal fins at stage 29 (Fig. 4A),
indicating that muscle precursor cells are present in developing dorsal fins. Then,
to test whether these Pax3–positive cells are MMPs, we investigated Lbx1

expression in skate dorsal fins. At stage 29, Lbx1 begins to be expressed in the
proximal domains of first and second dorsal fins, which is similar to Pax3
expression (Fig. 4B). At stage 30, Lbx1 expression extended to the distal part of
dorsal fins and was undetectable at stage 31 (Fig. 4C). Sectioning of embryos
after whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that Lbx1-expressing cells resided
beneath the epidermis of dorsal fins (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, actin staining by
phalloidin showed that MMPs accumulate actin internally, which is a signature of
differentiating muscle precursor cells (Fig. 4E,F). These results demonstrate that
the dorsal fin muscles of skates originate from MMPs.
Discussion
Comparison of skates and chain catsharks highlights a conserved developmental
pattern of neuromuscular systems – the dual contribution into the body wall and
paired appendages at the same vertebrae level. Intriguingly, the dual contribution
of hypaxial muscle precursors into the body wall and pectoral fins has been
previously reported in species of catsharks (10). Furthermore, the branching
pattern of spinal nerves into the pectoral fin and body wall was also described in
the anatomical study of dogfish (Squalus acanthias), lungfish (Propterus dolloi),
and teleosts (26, 38–40). The cumulative knowledge of appendage
neuromuscular systems in diverse taxa implies that their extension into both the
body wall and paired appendages at the same vertebrae level, which is
conserved in chondrichthyans, actinopterygians, and sarcopterygians, and
absent in agnathans, is a synapomorphy for gnathostome appendages (Fig. 5).
In contrast to ancestral dual contribution of the neuromuscular systems in fish,
tetrapods do not possess similar patterns at the brachial segments (Fig.5). This
loss may be related to appendage narrowing: the narrowing width of pectoral
appendages during the fish-to-tetrapod transition (41, 42), may have been

associated with the loss of this feature. In mammals, rostral intercostal nerves
(the 2nd and 3rd in humans) have the intercostobrachial branches, and the
subclavius nerve branches from the brachial plexus, both of which extend into
the pectoral and body wall domains (43). These nerves may be a remnant of the
branching nervous system from the primitive condition of vertebrates, although
comparative analysis of their developmental patterns as well as underlying
molecular mechanisms across diverse taxa is critical to conclude.
How has the pattern of dual contribution of neuromuscular systems been
modified or lost during the evolution of limbed vertebrates? In chicken embryos,
Hoxa4 is expressed in the LPM lateral to somites 3–7 and Hoxa5 is expressed in
the LPM adjacent to somites 4–10, both which are capable of inducing Tbx5
expression (35). In skates, these Hox genes are broadly expressed in the LPM
lateral to somites 7–50, which is significantly wider than other vertebrates (Fig.
3Q). While LPM expression domains of Hox paralogous groups 4 and 5 in sharks
are not precisely described, these dynamic changes of Hox expression patterns
in the LPM are most likely involved in evolving wide pectoral fins. Hox expression
is also indispensable for hindlimb development. Particularly, Hoxa9–11 genes
likely determine hindlimb position in the LPM and vertebrae identity in the PAM
(44, 45). In skate, Hoxa9, Hoxa10, Hoxa11, and Hoxd8 are shifted caudally
compared with sharks in the neural tube, LPM, and PAM (Fig. 3Q). The posterior
shift of these Hox genes probably caused extensive and concomitant remodeling
of muscles, nerves, and skeletons in the pelvic fin of skates. In the tetrapod
lineage, the opposite trend, restricting expression domains of a certain set of Hox
genes such as the Hox4 and Hox5 paralogous groups, might transform the
neuromuscular pattern of dual contribution into an exclusive one.

The newly defined expression of Lbx1 in skate dorsal fins sheds light on the
evolutionary origin of appendicular neuromuscular systems (Fig. 5). If paired
appendages evolved by a redeployment of the developmental programs in dorsal
fins (46), then MMPs with Lbx1 expression in dorsal fins are likely to be the
evolutionary origin of paired appendage muscles. During the origin of paired
appendages, the developmental programs of MMPs, including Pax3 and Lbx1
expression, might have been redeployed from unpaired to paired appendages,
and elaborated by recruiting other signaling pathways such as HGF/MET (47). If
paired appendages were assembled de novo, then genetic programs of MMPs
for paired appendages might have been deployed from MMPs that were already
equipped in the development of other muscles such as hypobranchial, dorsal fin,
or diaphragm muscles. Further analysis of regulatory regions of Lbx1 in multiple
species including agnathans, which have only unpaired fins, could pursue this
hypothesis. Our analysis of neuromuscular development in chondrichthyans
illuminates the evolutionary origins and diversification mechanisms of
neuromuscular systems of paired appendages.

Characterization of ortholog genes
Cloning and characterization of Wnt3 and Fgf8 were described in the previous
study(27). Lbx1, Pax3, Cyp26a1 and Hox genes used in this study were cloned
from cDNA of stage 23 and 30 skate embryos by reverse-transcriptase PCR and
integrated into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). PCR cloning primers are listed in
Supplementary Table 1. After cloning, each sequence was compared with the
previously annotated skate transcriptome (27).
Whole–mount immunostaining and in situ hybridization in chondrichthyans
Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (27).
The details of the protocol and replicate numbers is in Supplementary
Information.
Paraffin sectioning and HE staining
Two shark and two skate embryos were fixed in Bouin’s solution overnight at
room temperature and then washed with 70% ethanol followed by 100% ethanol.
Paraffin sectioning of fixed embryos (8 μm) and hematoxylin and eosin staining
were performed by the Human Tissue Resource Center at the University of
Chicago (https://pathcore.bsd.uchicago.edu/index.php).
Cryosectioning of skate embryos
After whole-mount in situ hybridization, embryos were re-fixed in 4% PFA and
immersed in a graded series of sucrose/PBS solutions (10%, 15%, 20%).
Embryos were placed in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek) overnight. The following
day, embryos were embedded and sectioned (8 μm) by Leica CM3050S.

Phalloidin staining
Skate embryos were recovered from egg cases and fixed in 4% PFA overnight.
The following day, embryos were treated in a sucrose/PBS solution series,
embedded, and cryosectioned as described above. Cryosections of four skate
embryos were rinsed in PBTriton 3 times and incubated with 10% sheep
serum/PBTriton for 30 minutes at room temperature. Sections were washed by
PBTriton 3 times and incubated with 1:1000 phalloidin–Alexa488 (Invitrogen) and
1:4000 DAPI in PBTriton for 1 hour. After sections were washed 3 times in
PBTriton, fluorescent images were captured on a Zeiss LSM510.
Reconstruction of innervation in shark embryos
Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were photographed with a Leica M205
FCA. Images were imported into Amira 3D reconstruction software
(ThermoFisher). Image direction was aligned, and 3D morphology was
reconstructed. Nerves innervating the pectoral fin and body wall muscles were
segmented manually and pseudo-colored.
Investigation of Hox expression patterns in NT, PAM, and LPM
After whole-mount in situ hybridization, expression domains of Hox genes were
investigated under a stereomicroscope and photographed (Leica M205 FCA and
MC170 HD). To determine the anterior limit of expression of Hox genes in NT
and LPM, the number of somites lateral to these tissues were counted.
Expression at ventral somites was used to identify anterior limits of Hox
expression in PAM.
Culture of skate embryos with RA
Five skate embryos were cultured from stage 23–30 in 900 mL of salt water
(Instant Ocean) with/without all-trans RA (Sigma; final concentration of 2 x 10-6
M). After the culture, embryos were fixed with 4% PFA and immunostained with

(A-C) Whole-mount in situ hybridization of Pax3 and Lbx1. (A, B) Dorsal and
ventral views of the expression patterns of Pax3 in the pectoral fin. Pax3 is
expressed in both muscles of the pectoral fin (arrow) and dermomyotome
(arrowhead) (A), or the pectoral fin (arrow) and body wall muscles (arrowhead)
(B). White arrow points to the umbilical cord (B). (C) Ventral view of Lbx1
expression pattern in the pectoral fin. Lbx1 is expressed only in the pectoral fin
(arrow) and not in the body wall muscles (arrowhead). (D-O) Immunostaining of
skate embryos by myosin heavy chain antibody at stage 29 (D-I) or stage 30 (JO) in lateral (D, E, F, J, K, and L) or ventral (G, H, I, M, N, and O) view. At stage
29, the constrictor branchialis, cucullaris and other cephalic muscles develop (D,
G). Abductor and adductor muscles start to develop in the pectoral (E, H) and
pelvic fins (F, I), yet they do not fully develop distally. Note that the abductor and
adductor muscles of the pectoral fin and hypaxial muscles of the body wall
develop at the same axial level (E, H). At stage 30, cephalic muscles are more
developed compared to stage 29. Cucullaris extends dorsal to branchial arches
(J). Interhyoideus and coracomandibularis are clearly identified (M). Abductor
and adductor muscles in the pectoral fins (K, N) and pelvic fins (L, O) develop
towards the distal direction. Abbreviations; abd.m.; abductor muscles, add.m.;

Figure 2 | Developmental pattern of nerves in chondrichthyan paired fins.
Immunostaining of nerves in developing embryos of skate (L. erinacea) and
shark (S. retifer) with 3A10 antibody. (A-E) Skate embryos at stage 29. (A)
Dorsal view shows the innervation patterns for the pectoral and pelvic fins. The
brachial plexus consists of Sp nerves. (B) Dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor)
root of spinal nerves for paired appendages. (C) Lateral view of the branchial
arch domain. Occipital nerves do not contribute to the brachial plexus; only spinal
nerves form the brachial plexus. The hypoglossal nerve and the pectoral fin
nerves were observed. (D) Dorsolateral view of the pectoral fin region. Spinal
nerves first branch into the pectoral fin laterally (arrowhead) and the body wall
muscle ventrally (arrow) (shown in inset). Then, a second branching event
occurred and the pectoral fin nerves innervate the dorsal and ventral muscles of
the pectoral fin. (E) Dorsolateral view of the pelvic fin region. Inset shows the
branching event where the spinal nerves split and innervate the pelvic fin
(arrowhead) and body wall (arrow) muscles. (F-G) Skate embryos at stage 31.
(F) Dorsal view of the pectoral fin region. Sp nerves directly innervate the
posterior pectoral fin without forming the brachial plexus. (G) Ventral view of the
pectoral fin region showing the brachial plexus and a second plexus-like structure
(*) innervating the pectoral fin. (H) 3D reconstruction of neuromuscular systems
in skate embryos at stage 29. The ventral roots of Sp nerves (green) exit from
the ventral neural tube and innervate into dorsal and ventral pectoral fin (orange)
as well as body wall muscles. (I-J) Shark embryos at stage 28. (I) Dorsal view of
the pectoral region. Inset shows the branching event as the Sp nerves split and
innervate the pectoral fin (arrowhead) and the body wall (arrow) muscles.
Distally, the pectoral fin nerves branch dorsoventrally. (J) Ventral view of the
pectoral fin. The v.b.s. is observed in the body wall. (K) 3D reconstruction of
neuromuscular systems in shark embryos at stage 29. The ventral roots of Sp
nerves (green) innervate into dorsal and ventral pectoral fin (red) as well as body
wall muscles (yellow). Abbreviations; a.b.; abductor muscle of the pectoral fin,

(A-P) Whole mount in situ hybridization of Fgf8, Wnt3, Cyp26a1, Cdx2, and Hox
groups A and D in L. erinacea at stage 23. Note that Hox genes show colinear
expression along the anteroposterior axis. In inset H, the black arrow, the white
arrowhead, and the black arrowhead point to the anterior limits of the expression
in the neural tube, PAM, and LPM, respectively. All scale bars are 1 mm. The
photos are scaled except for E, G, N, and P, which are scaled with each other.
(Q) Schematic summary of Hox expression patterns in L. erinacea in the neural
tube (red), pharyngeal arches (yellow), paraxial mesoderm (green), and lateral
plate mesoderm (blue). Expression levels of Hox genes are indicated by color
darkness. Darker bars show the anterior limit of expression of each Hox gene in
S. retifer embryos (34), indicating that expression patterns of Hoxa9, a10, a11,
and d8 have shifted posteriorly in L. erinacea. Anterior limits of each gene in the
neural tube (NT), lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), and paraxial mesoderm (PAM)
were determined by extending the anterior border of the adjacent somite
(Material and Methods). (R) Innervation staining of an RA- L. erinacea embryo.
Note the overlap of the pectoral and pelvic fins (arrow). (S-U) Innervation staining
of L. erinacea embryos cultured with retinoic acid, resulting in narrower pectoral
fin size than RA- embryos and creating a thoracic region between the pectoral

in the muscle precursor cells in the first and second dorsal fins at stage 29 and
the expression extends in the distal direction at stage 30. (D) Section of the
embryo stained by whole-mount in situ hybridization of Lbx1. Arrowheads
indicate expression of Lbx1. (E, F) Section staining of a dorsal fin by phalloidin
(Actin; green) and DAPI (nucleus; blue). Migratory muscle precursor cells are
observed right under the epidermal tissues. F is a magnified image of E without
overlay of DAPI. All scale bars are 1 mm.
Figure 5 | Summary and hypothesis of neuromuscular evolution in
appendages.
Summary of neuromuscular evolution in appendages. In skates, sharks,
zebrafish, and lungfish, muscles and nerves branch into the body wall and paired
appendages at the same axial level (Blue color in the tree represents animals
that possess the dual contribution of neuromuscular systems). Amniotes lost this
branching pattern, and neuromuscular components exclusively contribute to
either body wall or paired appendages. In skates, the dual contribution of
neuromuscular components is extended posteriorly to support undulatory
swimming.
