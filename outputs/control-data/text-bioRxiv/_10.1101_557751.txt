ABSTRACT
A significant bottleneck in synthetic biology involves screening large genetically encoded

34

libraries for desirable phenotypes such as chemical production. However, transcription factor-

35

based biosensors can be leveraged to screen thousands of genetic designs for optimal chemical

36

production in engineered microbes. In this study we characterize two glutarate sensing

37

transcription factors (CsiR and GcdR) from Pseudomonas putida. The genomic contexts of csiR

38

homologs were analyzed and their DNA binding sites were bioinformatically predicted. Both

39

CsiR and GcdR were purified and shown to bind upstream of their coding sequencing in vitro.

40

CsiR was shown to dissociate from DNA in vitro when exogenous glutarate was added,

41

confirming that it acts as a genetic repressor. Both transcription factors and cognate promoters

42

were then cloned into broad host range vectors to create two glutarate biosensors. Their

43

respective sensing performance features were characterized, and more sensitive derivatives of the

44

GcdR biosensor were created by manipulating the expression of the transcription factor. Sensor

45

vectors were then reintroduced into P. putida and evaluated for their ability to respond to

46

glutarate and various lysine metabolites. Additionally, we developed a novel mathematical

47

approach to describe the usable range of detection for genetically encoded biosensors, which

48

may be broadly useful in future efforts to better characterize biosensor performance.

INTRODUCTION
A rate limiting step in the design-build-test-learn cycle is often the test phase, wherein

54
55

hundreds or thousands of genetic designs need to be evaluated for their productivity 1,2. Though

56

recent advances in analytical chemistry have dramatically increased sample throughput 3,

57

transcription factor-based biosensors still offer multiple advantages over traditional

58

chromatographic and mass-spectrometry based detection methods 4,5. One of the most attractive

59

benefits is the ability to rapidly screen constructs for the production of the target compounds via

60

either plate-based or flow-cytometry-based assays 1–3, which increases throughput by orders of

61

magnitude compared to mass-spectrometry based methods. Additionally, biosensors may offer

62

unmatched sensitivity towards specific ligands, with some sensors having picomolar affinity 3.

63

The evolution of diverse microbial metabolism has provided researchers with the ability to sense

64

a wide array of ligands, ranging from complex natural products 6,7 to small central metabolites

65

1,8

66

.
Diacids, polyamines, and lactams are petrochemical derivatives used to produce various
9,10

67

polyester and nylon fibers

. In an effort to make production of these chemicals sustainable,

68

many groups have developed engineered microbes to synthesize these precursors 11–14. The L-

69

lysine metabolism of Pseudomonas putida has been leveraged both in the native host and

70

heterologously to produce valerolactam 15 the diacid glutarate 16,17. Recently, this utility has

71

inspired much work to uncover missing steps in the lysine catabolism of P. putida. These

72

missing steps included the discovery that glutarate is not only catabolized through the previously

73

known coA-dependent route to acetyl-coA, but is also catabolized through a coA-independent

74

route to succinate 16,18 (Figure 1). Recent work has also demonstrated that both glutarate

75

catabolic pathways are highly upregulated in the presence of glutarate 18. The Pseudomonas

76

aeruginosa homolog of the ketogenic pathway regulator (GcdR) 19and the Escherichia coli

77

homolog of the glucogenic pathway regulator (CsiR) have both been characterized. Furthermore

78

a rigorous investigation of the P. putida homologs has now been reported 20..

92

In this work we sought to also characterize the two putative local regulators of glutarate

93

catabolism in P. putida, csiR and gcdR. First, we compared the genomic context of csiR

94

homologs across bacteria to bioinformatically predict a conserved DNA binding site. We then

95

biochemically and genetically characterized both regulators. Secondly, we developed a novel

96

mathematical approach to rigorously determine the detection ranges for genetically encoded

97

biosensors that can be used to systematically compare biosensors. . Finally, we introduced RFP

98

transcriptional-fusions of the promoter for both catabolic pathways into P. putida and evaluated

99

their induction upon the addition of various lysine metabolites.

102

Work in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has characterized the GcdR regulation of ketogenic

103

glutarate metabolism, and shown that the binding site is conserved across multiple bacterial

104

species 19. While binding sites for CsiR in E. coli have been identified, it was yet to be

105

investigated whether there is a conserved binding site for homologs across bacterial species 21. In

106

order to identify conserved binding sites of CsiR homologs, we compared the syntenic genomic

107

contexts of 12 selected genomes that contained neighboring csiD and csiR homologs. Genes

108

encoding csiR were found in two distinct genomic contexts, either transcribed divergently from

109

csiD as found in P. putida, or transcribed as the last gene in the csiD operon as in E. coli (Figure

110

2). The genomic regions upstream of the csiD homolog were extracted and Multiple EM for

111

Motif Elicitation (MEME) was used to identify a conserved CsiR binding motif 22. A consensus

112

A(A/G)AAATCTAGA(C/T)ATTTT motif was identified upstream of each csiD homolog.

113

Previously, footprinting assays in E. coli BW25113 revealed two primary and two secondary

114

bindings sites with the sequences TTGTN5TTTT and ATGTN5TTTT respectively 21. While this

115

manuscript was under review Zhang et al. demonstrated via DNase I footprinting that CsiR does

116

indeed binding at two locations upstream of csiD, including the conserved

117

A(A/G)AAATCTAGA(C/T)ATTTT motif 20. Our consensus motif agrees closely with the

118

secondary binding site identified, and highly suggests that the binding site of CsiR is conserved

119

across the bacteria where homologs are present.

Biochemical characterization of CsiR and GcdR

To determine if the P. putida CsiR also acts as a regulator and to identify its putative

127

binding sites, we biochemically characterized this protein using electrophoretic mobility shift

128

assays (EMSAs). The CsiR protein was purified (Figure S1) and incubated with DNA probes

129

consisting of the intergenic region between csiR and csiD. The assay showed multiple binding

130

sites in this intergenic region, as four distinct bands appeared. These results appear to confirm

131

previous work in E. coli in which four binding sites of the E. coli CsiR homolog were observed

132

21

133

(Figure 3Aa), which is similar to the 10 nM CsiR/DNA Kd of the E. coli CsiR homolog, and

134

nearly identical to the results of Zhang et al. which showed complete probe shift at 6-fold molar

135

excess CsiR 20,21. Purified GcdR (Figure S1) also bound to its cognate probe with a single

136

distinct shift and had an an estimated Kd of approximately 62.5 nM (Figure 3A)

137

results were consistent with Zhang et al., who showed near complete probe shifts at 8-fold molar

138

excess GcdR 20. As CsiR is a GntR family transcriptional regulator, many of which act as

139

repressors 23, we evaluated whether glutarate would decrease the DNA binding affinity of CsiR.

140

EMSA assays were repeated in the presence of increasing glutarate concentrations. Analysis by

141

gel electrophoresis revealed increasing quantities of free probe as glutarate concentrations

142

increased (Figure 3B). These results suggest that the P. putida CsiR is a glutarate-responsive

143

repressor of the csiDlhgO operon21. Zhang et al. also showed that in addition to dissociating from

144

the DNA probe at high concentrations of glutarate, CsiR was also responsive to 2-

145

hydroxyglutarate (2HG) 20.

. CsiR had a high affinity for the DNA probe, with a calculated Kd of approximately 30 nM

154

In order to evaluate CsiR and GcdR as biosensors, we cloned both the regulator and

155

intergenic region of both the coA-independent and coA-dependent glutarate catabolism pathways

156

upstream of RFP on the broad host range vector pBADT. E. coli DH10B harboring either vector

157

were grown for 24 hours in EZ-Rich medium supplemented with concentrations of glutarate

158

ranging from 0.00015 mM to 2.5 mM, after which both OD600 and RFP fluorescence were

159

measured. At 2.5 mM glutarate, the GcdR and CsiR vectors demonstrated a maximal induction

160

over background of 55.5 and 1.5 times over uninduced cells, respectively; however, the CsiR

161

system showed considerable background signal (Table 1). Normalized RFP expression for each

162

sensor was fitted to the Hill equation to derive biosensor performance. The GcdR system was

163

found to have a Hill coefficient of 1.33, a Kd of 0.32 mM, and a maximum predicted normalized

164

RFP expression of 5403, while the CsiR system was shown to have a Hill coefficient of 1.61, a

165

Kd of 0.016 mM, and a maximum predicted normalized RFP expression of 3223 (Figure 4A). To

166

test for the ability of CsiR or GcdR to sense other diacids, E. coli harboring either vector were

167

grown in LB medium with 5 mM to 0.00015 mM of either succinate, adipate, or pimelate. While

168

pimelate and succinate were unable to induce either system, 2.5 mM adipate induced the CsiR

169

biosensor ~0.2x, and induced the GcdR system ~4x over background (Figure S2).

170

Given that GcdR showed a greater dynamic and substrate range with no response to 2-

171

HG, we tested whether the performance characteristics of these GcdR system could be altered.

172

The promoter region 50 bp upstream sequence of gcdR in the GcdR-sensing vector was replaced

173

by three different previously characterized constitutive promoters from the Anderson collection

174

(J23101, J23110, and J23113), representing a high (1791 RFP AU), medium (844 RFP AU) , and

175

low (21 RFP AU) strengths 24. All of the engineered GcdR systems showed reduced limits of

176

detection and increased sensitivity to glutarate compared to natively regulated GcdR, with each

179

native system (Figure 4B), but also had nearly 30x greater basal RFP expression (Table 1).

180

While all three engineered GcdR vectors performed similarly, the limit of detection of J23110

181

was 5x less than the other two vectors, likely due to the lower basal expression of the vector

(Table 1).

Developing metrics to quantify biosensor performance

200

In previously published work the mathematical basis for determining linear range or limit

201

of detection has often been obscure and non-systematic 1,8,25. Furthermore, a linear range may not

202

be able to adequately capture the performance characteristics of a biosensor over the range of

203

ligand concentrations where the sensor can still resolve differences. To address these

204

deficiencies, we sought to develop a mathematical method for evaluating the sensing

205

performances of genetically encoded transcription factors fitted to the Hill equation. Our

206

approach uses a probabilistic model to relate inducer concentration and corresponding

207

fluorescence measurements fit to the Hill equation assuming: (1) fluorescence measurements at a

208

particular concentration are normally distributed, (2) the variance of fluorescence measurements

209

is roughly constant over the range of measured values, and (3) the relationship between ligand

210

concentrations and fluorescence can be well modeled using the Hill function. This model allows

211

us to estimate the concentration of ligand compatible with our observed fluorescence data given

212

the variance of the data as determined via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling 26. A

213

detailed methodological description can be found in the supplemental Jupyter notebook, which

214

can be used to analyze other biosensor data.

215

By applying MCMC sampling to the model of our native GcdR biosensor, we can readily

216

produce the probability density functions (i.e. the probability that the ligand produces the

217

observed fluorescent response) of specific ligand concentrations (Figure 5A). At glutarate

218

concentrations of 0.25 mM, 0.68 mM, and 1.125 mM associated fluorescence values can be

219

resolved from one another (no overlap), however the biosensor is less able to resolve ligand

220

concentrations between 1.5 mM and 2 mM (Figure 5A). When we apply MCMC sampling to the

221

GcdR sensor being driven by the J23101 promoter, we observe that this system possesses the

222

resolution to distinguish between 0.004 mM and 0.011 mM, but is less able to distinguish

223

between higher concentrations (Figure 5B). A biosensor’s resolution window, defined as the

224

width of the 95% prediction interval of inducer concentrations derived from a set of fluorescence

225

measurements, can then be expressed as a continuous function across a range of ligand

226

concentrations for a given biosensor (Figure 5C). Below concentrations of ~0.01 mM glutarate

227

the J23101 GcdR biosensor has greater resolution, while at higher concentrations the native

228

GcdR sensor system has greater resolution(Figure 5C). Another important aspect of our approach

229

is that it allows for the resolution window to be calculated as a function of the number of

230

replicates in a biosensor experiment. If either variance decreases or sample size increases, the

231

resolution of a biosensor also increases. By simulating sample sizes of 1 through 100 via MCMC

232

sampling, the theoretical resolution of the native GcdR dramatically increases (Figure 4D). This

233

“power” analysis may serve as a guide for experimental design when a certain biosensor

234

resolution is required for a given application. We believe this approach may be generally useful

235

to any dataset derived from fluorescent transcription factor based biosensors. To demonstrate this

236

we also applied our MCMC methodology to two well characterized BglBrick vectors, pBbBSk-

237

rfp and pBbBEk-rfp, which express RFP from arabinose-inducible vectors from SC101 or ColE1

238

origins respectively (Figure S3). Fluorescence data from each vector (Figure S3A), was fit to the

239

Hill question (Figure S3B), and demonstrated that both vectors had the highest resolution at an

240

Responsiveness of glutarate biosensors to lysine metabolites in P. putida

250

To assess the ability of these vectors to function in P. putida both plasmids were

251

introduced into either wild type P. putida or a strain with both known pathways of glutarate

252

catabolism deleted (ΔcsiDΔgcdH - referred to as Δglutarate ). The resulting strains were grown

253

in MOPS minimal medium supplemented with 10 mM glucose and glutarate ranging from 5 mM

254

to 0.01 mM for 24 hours. Both vectors responded to increased concentrations of exogenously

255

applied glutarate, though the GcdR vector had ~10x greater fluorescence than the CsiR vector

256

(Figure 6A). The Δglutarate strain showed increased levels of RFP induction using both the CsiR

257

and GcdR systems, suggesting both vectors are able to sense increased levels of glutarate (Figure

258

6A). To further examine the ability of these vectors to probe P. putida lysine metabolism, both

259

were also introduced into a ΔdavT strain, which is unable to metabolize 5-aminovalerate to

260

glutarate semialdehyde (Figure 1A) and therefore precludes glutarate production. When wild

261

type, ΔdavT, and Δglutarate strains harboring either the CsiR or GcdR systems were grown on

262

minimal medium supplemented with 10 mM glucose and 10 mM 5-aminovalerate, both vectors

263

in the ΔdavT strain showed decreased fluorescence compared to wild type, while vectors in the

264

Δglutarate strains showed increased fluorescence (Figure 6B). Measurement of intracellular 5-

265

aminovalerate showed significant pools of the metabolite in the ΔdavT strains (~1500

266

uM/OD600) with no detectable 5-aminovalerate in the other genetic backgrounds (Figure 6C).

267

These results highly suggest that both GcdR and CsiR are insensitive to 5-aminovalerate, an

268

essential feature of these sensors if they are to be used in organisms that derive glutarate from a

269

5-aminovalerate precursor.

270

To evaluate the ability of both reporter vectors to monitor the catabolism of other lysine

271

metabolites, wild-type P. putida harboring either GcdR or CsiR were grown in minimal media

272

supplemented with either 10 mM glucose, L-lysine, D-lysine, 5-aminovalerate, or 2-

273

aminoadipate for 48 hours with OD600 and RFP fluorescence being measured continuously

274

(Figure S4A and Figure S4B ). Neither vector was induced when the bacterium was grown on

275

glucose (Figure S4). The GcdR vector was strongly induced when grown on 5-aminovalerate,

and to a lesser extent 2-aminoadipate, D-lysine, and L-lysine (Figure S4A). Conversely, the

277

strain harboring the CsiR vector only displayed induction of RFP above background when grown

278

on 5-aminovalerate (Figure S4B). While 5-aminovalerate was able to induce RFP induction in

279

the strain harboring the CsiR vector, induction was extremely limited compared to induction of

280

RFP from the GcdR vector (Figure S4).

DISCUSSION

292

Recent advances in high-throughput functional genomics have allowed researchers to

293

rapidly identify novel metabolic pathways, and in turn infer the function of novel transcription

294

factors 27,28. Rigorous characterization of these regulators is a critical step to developing novel

295

parts for synthetic biology as well as useful tools for metabolic engineering. The discovery of

296

two distinct pathways for glutarate catabolism within P. putida, regulated by independent

297

transcription factors, presents an interesting opportunity to compare and contrast the relative

298

sensing properties of each system.

299

CsiR and GcdR homologs have now been characterized thoroughly in multiple bacteria,

300

and have demonstrated that CsiR acts as a repressor of csiD whereas GcdR acts as a positive

301

regulator of gcdHG 19–21. Our bioinformatic analyses suggest that the binding site of CsiR is

302

highly conserved amongst bacteria that possess the regulator (Figure 2). While our CsiR

303

biosensor was shown to have a lower limit of detection of glutarate than the unengineered GcdR

304

biosensor (Table 1), Zhang et al. demonstrated that CsiR is also responsive to 2-HG 20. Given

18

305

that the GcdR biosensor can readily be engineered to have lower limits of detections, it is likely

306

the better choice to detect glutarate via a genetically encoded transcription factor.

307

Multiple works have demonstrated that engineering changes to the expression of a

308
309

transcription factor, the responsiveness of the transcriptional output can also be changed 31,32. .

310

By engineering the promoter of the gcdR transcription factor, the sensitivity of all the vectors

311

were increased from ~1.3 to ~1.7, while the Kd was lowered from 0.32 mM to ~0.01 mM (Figure

312

4B). This sensitivity to glutarate may make this vector useful in prototyping novel routes to

313

biological production of the C5 diacid. However at high concentrations of adipate (>1.25 mM)

314

GcdR is also activated, which may confound results (Figure S2).
While our preliminary work with exogenously applied ligand is promising, further work

315
316

remains to be done to evaluate the ability of these sensors to detect flux of glutarate in living

317

cells. Multiple recent publications have shown that glutarate metabolism is widespread in

318

bacteria, and evaluating the ability of the CsiR and GcdR sensors to measure this flux will

319

require careful experimentation with C13 labelled substrates. Another possible confounding

320

factor in utilizing these vectors is the presence of CsiR or GcdR binding sites in the host

321

organism. The overexpression of either transcription factor may misregulate host metabolism.

322

This hypothesis is supported by the differences in growth observed between GcdR and CsiR

323

biosensor containing P. putida when grown on lysine metabolites (Figure S4).
The overarching goal of synthetic biology is to apply engineering principles to biological

324
325

systems so that outcomes of genetic manipulation can become more predictable and repeatable

326

33,34

327

of biosensors, there has been conspicuously few attempts to rigorously describe at which ligand

. While there has been a large body of work devoted to the characterization and application

328

concentrations a biosensor is useful. Often the analysis merely states limit of detection, and a

329

‘linear range’ with little in terms of a mathematical justification. Here we present an alternative

330

metric that allows for the calculation of ligand resolution across the entire range of detection for

331

a biosensor. By leveraging a MCMC approach to predicting ligand ranges compatible with

332

fluorescence values, researchers can more precisely describe a biosensors performance and

333

identify whether a given biosensing system is potentially useful for a given engineering task. The

334

MCMC approach also allows for the simulation of an increasing number of replicates, which

335

could inform the researcher of the replicates that may be required in an experimental design to

336

achieve a desired level of resolution. We hope that this initial work to better characterize

337

biosensor performance inspires other groups to develop even more sophisticated methods of

338

analysis.

339

In addition to their utility as biosensors for metabolic engineering, these sensors may be a

340

valuable tool in studying the carbon utilization in the native host P. putida. Work conducted here

341

demonstrates the ability of both CsiR and GcdR sensors to distinguish between glutarate

342

accumulating and mutants blocked in their ability to metabolize 5-aminovalerate to glutarate

343

(Figure 6). Lysine metabolism in P. putida is isomer specific, with each isomer being degraded

344

by a separate catabolic pathway 18. While cross-feeding between the pathways has been proposed

345

previously 35, recent work by our group has proposed a molecular mechanism for metabolite

346

exchange between the D- and L- catabolic pathways 18. The exchange relies on the 2-oxoacid

347

promiscuity of the non-heme Fe(II) oxidase CsiD, which normally catalyzes the hydroxylation of

348

glutarate using 2-ketoglutarate as a cosubstrate to yield 2-hydroxyglutarate and succinate. CsiD

349

can also use 2-oxoadipate, a D-lysine catabolic intermediate, as a 2-oxoacid cosubstrate to yield

350

2-hydroxyglutarate and glutarate as products. The glutarate from this reaction could then proceed

351

down the L-lysine catabolic pathway. When 2-aminoadipate was fed into P. putida harboring the

352

GcdR vector, fluorescence was observed in stationary phase. As 2-aminoadipate immediately

353

precedes 2-oxoadipate in the D-lysine catabolic pathway, these results support the hypothesis

354

that CsiD could act as a bridge between the two catabolic pathways. There has been substantial

355

interest in developing microbes to produce glutarate, with strains of E. coli, P. putida, and

356

Corynebacterium glutamicum all engineered to produce high titers 16,36,37. Further engineering of

357

the GcdR system may be able to extend the resolvable range to higher concentrations, furthering

358

its utility as a tool to achieve even higher titers of glutarate. Though glutarate is a valuable

359

commodity chemical, the C6 diacid adipate is used in much greater quantities primarily as a

360

monomer used to make nylons 33. This slight sensitivity of GcdR toward adipic acid is

361

especially interesting, as recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of evolving

362

transcription factors to sense non-native ligands 6. Such methods could be applied to GcdR in

363

order to expand its utility in sensing other industrially important diacids.

402

48-well plates (Falcon, 353072). Plates were sealed with a gas-permeable microplate adhesive

403

film (VWR, USA), and then optical density and fluorescence were monitored for 48 hours in a

404

Biotek Synergy 4 plate reader (BioTek, USA) at 30 °C with fast continuous shaking. Optical

405

429

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Binding reactions were conducted with 10 ng of labelled probe,

430

which was added to 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM DTT and

431

2 ug salmon sperm DNA in 20 uL reactions. CsiR was added to reactions in concentrations

432

ranging from 250 nM to ~4 nM, in addition to a control reaction without CsiR, and then allowed

433

to incubate at 22 oC for 20 minutes. Reactions were then loaded into 10% native polyacrylamide

Analysis of biosensor parameters
A model relating inducer concentrations and fluorescence measurements to characterize

447
448

the performance of a biosensor was generated under the following assumptions 1) the

449

relationship between analyte concentrations and fluorescence can be well modeled using the Hill

450

equation 2) fluorescence measurements at a particular concentration are normally distributed 3)

451

the variance of fluorescence measurements is roughly constant over the range of measured

452

values.

453

Under these assumptions we can phrase the following probabilistic model via equation 1

454

(Figure 7). Using the probabilistic model which captures our constraints on the problem the log

455

likelihood function is expressed as equation 2 (Figure 7).The log likelihood is used to express the

456

maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem as equation 3 (Figure 7),which when solved

457

results in the optimal parameters of the model given the characterization data. In order to

458

estimate the distribution of ligand concentrations that are compatible with experimental

459

fluorescence data, MCMC sampling was used to solve the MLE problem equation 4 (Figure 7).

460

We determined biosensor resolution by solving the above maximum likelihood estimation

461

problem iteratively over the range of observed fluorescences during the biosensor

462

characterization process. This can determine the relationship between an inducer concentration

463

estimate and the estimated standard deviation. The standard deviation of the estimate of inducer

464

concentration can be interpreted as the resolution window. In the case of this work, two standard

465

deviations is considered the resolution window of the sensor, as 95% of the compatible inducer

466

concentration estimates fall within the interval.

467

To determine minimal and maximal levels of ligand detection of a given biosensor, the

468

minimal detection limit was defined as the minimal concentration of inducer that resulted in a

469

OD600 normalized RFP value significantly (t-test pval <0.05) greater than that of uninduced

470

cultures, while the maximal detection limit was defined as the greatest concentration of inducer

471

that resulted in a OD600 normalized RFP value significantly (t-test pval <0.05) less than that of

472

cultures induced with the highest concentration of ligand experimentally tested (2.5 mM).
