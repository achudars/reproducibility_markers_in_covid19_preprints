Abstract

Metabolomics data are difficult to find and reuse, even in public repositories. We, therefore, developed the
Reanalysis of Data User (ReDU) interface (https://redu.ucsd.edu/), a community- and data-driven approach that
solves this problem at the repository scale. ReDU enables public data discovery and co- or re-analysis via
uniformly formatted, publicly available MS/MS data and metadata in the Global Natural Product Social Molecular
Networking Platform (GNPS), consistent with findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)
principles.1

Results and Discussion

Many simple but important questions can be asked using repository-scale public data. For example, what
human biospecimen or sampling location is best for detecting a given drug? Or what molecules are found in
humans <2 years old? Current metabolomics repositories typically require manual navigation and conversion of
thousands of different vendor-formatted files with inconsistent metadata formats, and developing data integration
algorithms, greatly complicating analyses.
ReDU addresses FAIR principles by enabling users to find and choose files (Fig 1a). This is possible
because ReDU formats sample information consistently via a template and drag-and-drop validator backed by
standard controlled vocabularies and ontologies (e.g. NCBI taxonomy,2 UBERON3, Disease Ontology4 and MS
ontology), and includes geographical location (important for natural products and environmental samples). ReDU
automatically uses all public data in the GNPS/MassIVE repository that has the corresponding ReDU-compliant
sample information. 34,087 files in GNPS are ReDU-compatible including natural and human-built environments,
human and animal tissues, biofluids, food, and other data from around the world (Fig 1f), analyzed using different
instruments, ionization methods, sample preparation methods, etc. From the 103,230,404 million MS/MS spectra
included in ReDU, 4,528,624 spectra were annotated (rate of 4.39% with settings yielding ~1% FDR) as one of
13,217 unique chemicals (Table S1).5,6,7
Uniformity of data and sample information in ReDU enables metadata-based and repository-scale
analyses (Fig. 1b-g). Chemical explorer enables selection of a molecule and retrieval of its associations with the
metadata, i.e. sample information association. For instance, selecting 12-ketodeoxycholic acid (filtering to
include human feces) revealed it was observed after infancy (Fig 1c), whereas cholic acid displayed the opposite
trend, coupled to the developing microbiome. Similarly, rosuvastatin was found in adults matching prescription

demographics. Another approach enabled is chemical enrichment analysis. For example, human blood, feces,
and urine differed by bilirubin, urobilin, and stercobilin (Fig 1d). Bilirubin was more frequently annotated in blood,
and urobilin and stercobilin were most often annotated in feces.8 Similarly, comparison of bacterial cultures
revealed differences in annotation of surfactin-C14 (observed in Bacillus subtilis) and cholic acid (observed in
Streptomyces). ReDU enables reanalysis based on metadata-selected files for molecular networking.5,9,10 Reanalyzing human blood plasma and serum, urine, and fecal samples, networked 5,053,666 MS/MS spectra
(~5.6% annotated) and included annotations to clindamycin. Clindamycin’s (1) molecular family matched multiple
datasets and sample types (Fig 1e). Using propagation through molecular networking (e.g. delta mass and
MS/MS spectral interpretation), we annotated clindamycin metabolites (2-9) Fig S1-S2, Table S2-S3. Ndesmethylclindamycin sulfoxide (6) was observed in multiple sample types across six different datasets. At the
repository scale, we can map sample geographical location and identify the number of chemical annotations for
each sample (Fig 1f), or locate specific molecules of interest (e.g. drugs) by mapping on the human body offline
(Fig 1g, Video S1). These are representative analyses uniquely enabled by the ReDU infrastructure.
ReDU makes public MS/MS data FAIR and connects MassIVE (a data repository recommended by
Nature publishing journal for metabolomics and proteomics data) to GNPS (an analysis environment), thereby
integrating public data deposition, sample information curation, and data analysis. ReDU’s utility will continue to
grow as more data is uploaded to GNPS/MassIVE,and public reference libraries expand, making ReDU a
resource developed by the community and FAIR for the community.

Early Childhood (2 yrs < x ≤ 8 yrs), n=93; Adolescence (8 yrs < x ≤ 18 yrs), n=169; Early Adulthood (18 yrs < x

Metadata filters were used to select human blood, feces, and urine into different groups and launch chemical
enrichment analysis. Bilirubin, urobilin, and stercobilin are illustrative of the chemical differences between the
groups. Similarly, bacterial cultures of 1423|Bacillus subtilis (n=89), 1280|Staphylococcus aureus (n=49), and
1883|Streptomyces (n=7) were selected into groups using filters. Surfactin-C14 and PyroGlu-Ile were two
exemplar chemicals observed to be different between groups. (e) Human blood, feces, and urine were selected
using ReDU metadata filters and re-analyzed together using molecular networking. A portion of the molecular
network associated with clindamycin is displayed. Nodes are colored by the UBERON ontology in which it was
detected: node size reflects the number of MassIVE datasets in which it was detected, node shape indicates
whether annotated via library search (annotated, diamond or unannotated, circle). Putatively annotated
clindamycin metabolites are indicated using dashed arrows and numbers, blue, corresponding to the proposed
structures (1-9). (f) ReDU sample locations (includes public data from samples of environmental, natural
products and other cohorts for which this information is provided) colored by number of annotations per file
(latitude and longitude), log10-scale, using the ReDU database. (g) ReDU database (filtered to include human
data) analyzed to visualize the distribution of chemical annotations tagged as drug or drug metabolite using ‘ili.12
Descladinose azithromycin was detected in blood plasma, breast milk, saliva, urine, and fecal samples. The
number of annotations are divided by the number of files per sample type (i.e. UBERON). A distribution map of
all drugs in ReDU is provided.
