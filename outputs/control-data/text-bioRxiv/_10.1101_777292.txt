Abstract

27

Studies that optimize the haploid technique in the removal of maize lines are necessary.

28

Between the stages that mostly requires attention and it is directly related to the success of

29

the technology is the correctly separation of induced haploids and diploids. Morphological

30

markers are commonly used but have strong influence of the environment, and laboratory

31

methods have been developed and may be more efficient. Thus, the objective was to study

32

the use of the anatomical analysis tool, through the analysis of young maize leaf for use as

33

the indirect markers in the identification of ploidys. The hybrids were crossed with the KEMS

34

haploid inducer. The seeds crossed, were selected according to the R-navajo marker and

35

submitted to two different protocols of chromosome duplication. Plants that survived to the

36

duplication protocols were acclimated in greenhouse and then transferred to the field. After

37

the self-polinization of the DH0 plants, the DH1 seeds were taken to the field, divided into

38

treatments according to the parentals and duplication protocols. At the vegetative stage V4 of

39

the plants, leaf tissue samples were collected to the evaluation of the amount of DNA and

40

identification of ploidys and anatomical analysis. The nuclear DNA review of each sample

41

was performed for the comparison in histograms of the position of G1 peak to the G1 peak of

42

the internal or external reference standard. A high accuracy came to validate an anatomical

43

tool, through the variables studied in this work, as a marker in the differentiation of ploidis in

44

maize plants, and it can be used in selection programs. The anatomy made in some letters is

45

a non-destructible technique and, together with a flow cytometry technique, can be used as

46

an indirect method in haploid cutting programs at the initial stage of the identification of

47

seedlings.

Introduction

53

The success of a breeding program that aims at the production of maize commercial

54

hybrids lies in the fact of obtaining elite lines. Among all the steps, this is considered to be

55

the most time-consuming and costly, and the technology of double haploid emerges as a

56

way of reducing time in obtaining these lines [1].

57

The rapid production of homozygotic lines allows a better exploitation of genetic

58

variability and increases the efficiency of selection. Homozygous plants will have the

59

maximum additive variance, the effects of dominance and epistasis, and the advantages in

60

the selection of quantitative, superior characteristics [2]. In addition, the decrease of the

61

costs with labor, use of smaller experimental area and anticipation of profits in commercial

62

programs for maze breeding have made this technique a great success.

63

The production of double- haploid lines involves four main steps: in vivo induction of

64

haploidy, identification of possible haploids, chromosome doubling and the self-fertilization of

65

lines obtained for increment of seeds [3]. However, the success of this methodology is still

66

dependent on the use of inductors with high capacity of induction, a precise system of

67

identification and differentiation of haploid and diploid seeds, as well as efficient and

68

reproducible protocols of chromosome doubling [4].

69

The doubling of the chromosome number spontaneously or induced by the application of

70

mitotic agents e.g., colchicine, retrieves the diploid condition and restores fertility [5]. The

71

action mechanism of colchicine involves the irreversible connection to tubulin dimers,

72

causing a conformational change and preventing the polymerization of mitotic spindle, and

73

as a result, the newly duplicated chromosomes are not separate and the core reorganizes

74

with the number of duplicated chromosomes [6]. However, not all cells of the treated tissue

75

polyploidize, which can lead to the formation of chimeras, i.e., tissues or plants with duplicate

76

sectors and others unduplicated ones [7] called mixoploids. Truly duplicated lines resulting

77

from this process are called duplicate or double haploids (DHs).

78

There are several methods for certification of polyploidization, being flow cytometry the

79

most used one [8]. Flow cytometry is a reliable and fast method, because it allows the

80

analysis of a large number of cells and of different tissues [9]. In experiments with double

81

haploids, flow cytometry allows vigorous seedlings and detected as diploids in the

82

histograms are discarded before the step of field, reducing time and space. In addition, flow

83

cytometry allows the analysis of the efficiency of the protocol of chromosome doubling, since

84

it is not possible to confirm if the response of seedlings to duplication was positive [10–12].

85

Another tool that is being studied as a marker in the differentiation of ploidies in plants is

86

the leaf anatomy, being the leaf considered the component with greater ability to adapt to

87

environmental conditions. Highly flexible, leaf anatomy is influenced by environmental

88

factors, such as, irradiation (leaves of sunlight/shade, [13], nutrients [14], drought [15] and

89

ozone [16,17]. Changes in the leaves characteristics, such as those related to the thickness

90

of the leaf blade, parenchymas, epidermis and number of stomata for example, and that are

91

highly associated with the photosynthetic potential of plants, are used in studies of genetic

92

selection by the use of morphological and anatomical markers. Additionally, they are highly

93

heritable characteristics, i.e., can be passed to their offspring [18].

94

The cytoanatomic characterization is a methodology that allows the identification of

95

haploid and supposed polyploidy in plants subjected to chromosome doubling. The study of

96

measurement and comparison of stomata, based on the principle that the length of the same

97

normally increases with the number of chromosomes, is the most commonly cited in the

98

literature [19].

99

The number of stomata in association with other leaf anatomical characteristics, has

100

already been mapped to different levels of ploidy in studies with coffee plants [20]. For this

101

species, the greater the number of stomata the higher the ploidy. In the case of Coffea

102

canephora, a reduction in the stomatal density is higher in the tetraploid level for some

103

cultivars [20]. [21], observed in Citrus that the size and density of stomata varied according to

104

ploidy level, where the triploids showed a higher number of stomata when compared to

105

diploid plants. A similar result was observed by [22], who stated to be possible the use of

106

anatomical markers for purposes of selection of citrus with different levels of ploidy.

107

Ploidy is well studied from the point of view of genetics and genomic perspective, but the

108

morphological and anatomical aspects related to these differences in the amount of DNA,

109

remain poorly studied in maze plants. Analyzing the anatomical characteristics of young

110

leaves of maize, capable of discriminating the different ploidies and extrapolate these results

111

in diploid and haploid discrimination on the optimization of the process of obtaining double

112

haploid is of extreme importance.

113

Thus, the objective of this work was to study the use of anatomical tool, through the

114

analysis of the characteristics of young leaves of maize for use as indirect markers in the

115

identification of ploidies, and through future studies, to extrapolate the use of this marker in

116

the identification of haploids in the initial stage of the process of obtaining double haploids.

117
118

Material and methods

119

The seeds used in this work were obtained from an experiment previously developed by

120

[23] through the cross between four simple hybrids (DKB393, GNS 3225, GNS 3264, GNS

121

3032) with the haploid inducer KEMS, used as male parental. Seeds from these crosses

122

were separated by staining of the embryo and endosperm and selected as possible haploids

123

according with the marker R-navajo [24].

124

The authors submitted the haploid seeds to two chromosome duplication protocols, and

125

the plants that survived the field, called DH0, that produced pollen and had stigma style in

126

synchronism, were self-fertilized, resulting in DH1 generation.

127

Thus, in this present work, in order to evaluate the maintenance of DH in future

128

generations, the DH1 ears were harvested and the seeds threshed and dried at room

129

temperature up to 12% moisture level at the point of physiological maturity. The seeds were

130

then mixed and divided into treatments as shown in Table 1. These seeds were then stored

131

in a cold chamber at 10 ° C until the following experiments were carried out.

In the harvest season 2014/2015, the total number of seeds DH1 for each treatment,

136

was taken to the field and the experimental design was a randomized complete blocks with

137

eight treatments with four replications. Each block was composed by lines of 10 meters of

138

length, with spacing of 80 cm between rows and among plants of 25 cm, and sowing of a

139

seed per hole. The collection of leaf material occurred in young stage of the plant maize, with

140

4 replicates collected at random within each treatment.

141

In the case of leaf anatomy, 5 replicates were performed for each repetition in the

142

laboratory, five blades of 10 sections each, were made, and the top five fields were

143

photographed and subsequently measured. The following were measured: thickness of the

144

leaf blade (ELF), thickness of the parenchyma (PAR), thickness of the upper epidermis

145

(EES) and lower epidermis (EEI), polar diameter of the stomata in the upper face (DPS) and

146

lower (DPI), equatorial diameter of the stomata of superior face (DES) and lower face (DEI)

147

and stomatal density on the upper surface (DS) and lower (DI). For that, in the vegetative

stage V4 which corresponds to the development of four leaves, leaf tissue samples were

149

collected.

150
151

For that, in the vegetative stage V4 which corresponds to the development of four
leaves, leaf tissue samples were collected.

152

For both evaluations, the medial portion of the young leaves fully developed, was cut

153

into segments of approximately 3 cm in length and wrapped in aluminum paper duly

154

identified per plant. Aluminum papers remained in a polystyrene box containing recyclable

155

crushed ice, until the time of transportation to the laboratory of tissue culture of plants of the

156

Department of Agriculture of UFLA.

157

At the opening of each envelope of aluminum, part of the samples of leaf tissue was

158

used for the quantification of DNA and part to the anatomical analysis. Therefore, young leaf

159

tissue samples of maize were crushed under ice, in Petri plates containing 1 mL of cold

160

buffer LB01, to obtain nuclear suspension [25], which was added 2,5µL RNase and stained

161

with 25 µL of propidium iodide (1 mg mL-1). The species Vicia faba (quantity of DNA of 26.9

162

pg/2C) was used as an external standard of reference and for each sample at least 10

163

thousand cores were analyzed. Each suspension was analyzed in flow cytometry

164

FacsCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The histograms obtained were evaluated by the WinMDI

165

software 2.8 (2009) for the evaluation of the peaks of DNA. The estimate of the nuclear DNA

166

content (pg) of each sample was performed by comparing the position of the peak G1 with

167

the peak G1 of the internal standard or external reference.

168

For this comparison the following expression was used:

175

S is the position of the peak G1 reference standard and

176

R is the quantity of DNA of the standard sample (26.9 pg/2C).

177

By the quantity of DNA it was possible to make inferences about the ploidy level of the

178

evaluated genotypes.

179

As mentioned, the other part of the samples of leaf tissue was immediately fixed in

180

FAA50, (formaldehyde: acetic acid: ethanol, 5:5:90) for 48 h. Then, the samples were

181

removed from the fixative solution, rinsed and stored in 70% ethanol solution [26]. At this

182

moment the samples were transported to the Laboratory of Anatomy and morphogenesis of

183

Plant Biology Department of the Federal University of Viçosa, where permanent slides were

184

made using portions of the leaf that were dehydrated in ethyl series included in historresin

185

(methacrylate), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transverse sections of

186

leaf were sectioned in automatic advance rotary microtome (model RM2155, Leica

187

Microsystems Inc., Deerfield, USA) with 5 μm thick, arranged on histological slides and

188

stained with toluidine blue [27], to the limbal micro morphometry.

189

For the stomata evaluations, fragments of the central part of the leaf blade were

190

sectioned from material stored in alcohol 70%. The samples were clarified by means of the

191

technique of Diaphanization, described by [28] and modified for the species, having been

192

clarified in methanol for 48 hours and then in lactic acid for 6 hours in water bath for 98 ºC

193

and assembled into lactic acid. After the staining procedure, the samples were immersed in

194

ethanol 80, 70 and 50%, and later were rinsed in distilled water. The histological slides with

195

leaf fragments were mounted on glycerol-jelly Images of the slides of cross cuts and

196

diaphanization were obtained under a light microscope (model AX-70 TRF, Olympus Optical,

197

Tokyo, Japan) coupled to a digital camera (model Zeiss AxioCam HRc, Göttinger, Germany)

198

and a microcomputer with the program to capture images Axion Vision, having been digitized

199

and stored in a microcomputer. For the analysis, 10 distinct fields of each sample were

200

measured by means of Image-Pro® Plus software (version 4.1, Media Cybernetics, Inc.,

201

Silver Spring, USA).

The analyzes were performed for all characters with the estimation of variance

203

components and the prediction of random effects using the approach of mixed models, the

204

method of restricted maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased prediction (REML/BLUP) [29].

For this, the following statistical model was used:

Where:

227

For all the evaluated characteristics the accuracy was classified as very high [31],

228

2
with values above 87.0%. On average, the heritability (ℎ𝑚
) of the characteristics was also

229

high with values above 84.0%, what indicates good reliability of data (Table 2). The

230

heritabilities of treatments ranged from 76.0% (EES) to 98.0% (DEI) among the evaluated

231

characteristics, which demonstrates that in the anatomic evaluation in this experiment, the

232

largest part of the variation observed is due to genetic causes to the detriment of

233

environmental variations [32].

234

The genotypic variance was highly significant by the LRT test and likelihood ratio for

235

the characters related to the thickness of the leaf blade (ELF), stomatal density of both the

236

upper surface (DS), as well as the lower surface (DI), thickness of the parenchyma (PAR),

237

thickness of the upper epidermis (EES) and lower epidermis (EEI), polar and equatorial

238

diameter of upper epidermis (DES and DPS) and lower (DEI and DPI), according to LRT (P

239

< 0.01), characterizing these characteristics as good candidates to be inserted in a breeding

240

program as markers. It was possible to realize that the characteristics related to the

241

thickness of the lamina and those related to the stomata were the ones that showed higher

242

heritability, followed by the thickness of the parenchyma. The thickness of the epidermis,

243

even with high heritability, were lower (Table 2).

The importance or contribution of each analyzed variable as a possible marker

282

in the separation of the tested plants, demonstrates greater relevance of the thickness

283

of the leaf blade and the stomata, while the thickness of epidermis little contributed to

284

the separation of plants. (Fig 3).

289

In parallel to the anatomical analyzes and with the aim of inferring the real

290

ploidies observed in the tested materials, the DNA quantification was performed by flow

291

cytometry technique in 32 selected plants (Table 4). The histograms obtained by this

292

method allows for the identification of the ploidy level of the individuals tested through

293

the location of the G1 peak of the sample on the axis of the relative intensity of

294

fluorescence (Fig 4). The dominant peaks generated in the histograms are relative to

295

the quantity of DNA of the cores in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The estimate of the

296

ploidy level is done by comparing the G1 peaks of the histogram of a sample with the

297

peak of a plant-standard with known ploidy [25].

298

Maize diploids have the peak G1, located in the region of relative intensity of

299

fluorescence, soon after the mark of 102 (Fig 4A). The haploids have lower relative

300

intensity of fluorescence and the peak G1 is located to the left of the mark of 102, i.e.,

301

dislocated in the direction of the x axis (Fig 4B). Whereas the triploids and the

302

tetraploids have still greater intensity than the diploids, locating at the right of the mark

303

of 102 and with higher peaks (fig not shown). Whereas the Double haploid plants, are

304

those that have ploidies haploid/diploid type (Fig 4C).

Usually, an association of the histogram obtained with a histogram of a

Discussion

321

It was possible through the analysis of mixed model to verify the existence of

322

variability in the anatomical characteristics, i.e., there is a difference among the tested

323

materials (P < 0.01) (Table 1). In addition, these variables showed a quality required for

324

insertion in a breeding program, with the aim of separation of evaluated materials [34].

325

The heritability and accuracy obtained were high in accordance with the classification

326

made by [31] (Table 1). The fact of the evaluated anatomical characteristics have

327

potential for use in selection programs is of extreme importance, since these

328

characteristics may be associated with the photosynthetic potential of plants, i.e., the

329

productive capacity of plant material, leaves, roots and seeds.

330

The thickness of the leaf blade (ELF), has a crucial role not only in the capacity

331

of carbon fixation by the chloroplasts of the palisade parenchyma, but also by the

332

internal storage of CO2 by sponge parenchyma [35]. While the stomata are the

333

channels of influence of CO and the flow of water vapor. For the plants to be effective,

334

they must balance the gaseous exchanges carried out through these structures to

335

maximize the absorption of CO2 for photosynthesis and minimize the loss of water

336

through transpiration. Thus increasing the efficiency of the use of the water and

337

consequently the plasticity of the plant in the face of environmental changes. A

338

program that aims at obtaining hybrids with greater adaptive capacity, seems a major

339

bottleneck of agriculture through the global climate changes [36].

340

The stomata behavior, therefore, controls the volume of CO2 in the intercellular

341

spaces of the leaf for photosynthesis. Even if the maze as plant of C4 metabolism is

342

able through the mechanisms of CO2 concentration, to maintain an adequate quantity

343

of C for photosynthesis [37], the stomatal density and the size of the stomata are

15

344

important characteristics to maximize efficiency. Once that, in spite of the area of the

345

pores of the stomata represent less than 3% of the total area of the leaf, about 98% of

346

all the absorbed CO2 and water lost occurs by these pores [38].

347

The anatomical characteristics of the stomata define the stomatal conductance

348

(gs), theoretical maximum [39], i.e., the functionality of the same and also influence the

349

speed of response. The maximum gs relates to the size and density of stomata, which

350

can be influenced by the environment of growth [40,41]. However, as in this study, all

351

the plants were grown in the same environment, we can consider that the density and

352

the pattern of size, influenced by the atmospheric concentration of CO2, water

353

availability [42] and light [43], varied according to the genetic characteristics of each

354

tested hybrid. This reinforces the importance of the anatomical characters as early

355

markers of separation of hybrids used in this study.

356

Experimental evidences showed that the density of stomata is negatively

357

correlated with the stomata size [40,41]. The interaction/correlation among stomata

358

size and density, and the impact on stomatal function has received much attention,

359

particularly with reference to the evolution of the performance and plasticity in plants

360

[41]. Evidence from several studies have also suggested that smaller stomata respond

361

faster than larger stomata, an observation that has been explained in the context of

362

relations surface-volume and the requirement for ck to boost the movement [44].

363

The selection of plants grown with changes in the density of stomata to increase

364

the performance of plants has been widely exploited [38,45], with limited success. The

365

increase of the stomatal density can increase the gs and the photosynthetic rate can

366

become 30% greater in conditions of high brightness [46].

367

The increase of photosynthesis can encourage the increase in weight, as

368

already mentioned. Increase in the weight of seed has also been associated with

369

induced polyploidy [47]. What can potentiate the vigor and germination of seeds,

370

favoring the formation of a more homogeneous stand. However, the manipulation of

16

371

functional stomate responses is clearly more complicated, requiring a thorough

372

understanding of the metabolism of the manipulated plant.

373

The use of these anatomical characteristics of the leaf is widely used for

374

identifying the levels of ploidy in many species of plants, such as alfalfa [48],

375

Gossypium [49], Dactylis [50], ryegrass [51], wheat [52] and Bromus inermis [53,54]. In

376

coffee the density of stomata decreased while its size increased with an increase in the

377

ploidy level, with the lower density found in the tetraploids and higher in the diploids

378

[20]. Genotypic differences in stomatal frequency and length of the guard cells were

379

also observed in barley [55], soybean [56] Triticale [57,58]. These studies demonstrate

380

the possibility of the use of anatomical markers with mechanism for identification of

381

ploidy.

382

In the present, it is verified the contribution of the ten variables evaluated in

383

separate studied plants and coincides with what is reported in the literature in relation

384

to the great importance of the stomata. Carefully observing the relative contribution of

385

each trait, it is verified that the variables associated to the stomata represent,

386

altogether, approximately 50% of the contribution of separation (Fig 3).

387

The high contribution of leaf blade is due to its constitution. The leaf blade is

388

composed by parenchyma, in which chloroplasts and spaces for CO2 storage are

389

located, in addition of course, all the other components of the leaf. Therefore its

390

relevance is easily understandable and the importance of variables related to the

391

stomata is also evident, reinforcing what is already described in several academic

392

articles.

393

In addition it is possible to suggest that the anatomic variables, as possible

394

markers were efficient on grouping even partially the hybrids (Tables 2 and 3).

395

Behavior that reinforces what has been described above, where the traits were efficient

396

anatomical markers for various crops. The treatments that showed higher averages for

397

the analyzed variables were classified as diploids (Table 3), in general with averages

398

exceeding the haploids (Table 2).

399

The increase in ploidy level may be the main driving force to facilitate the plants

400

breeding, as it provides important phenotypic effects, such as increasing the size of the

401

cells and organs, and sometimes a larger force and biomass, and additional molecular

402

and phenotypic variation that may arise soon after the formation of the polyploids. This

403

behavior can be attributed to the effect "gigantism", in which plants with higher ploidy

404

may have increased the size of their structures [19]. The treatments 6 and 7 (diploids),

405

for the characteristics related to leaf blade (ELF and PAR), showed higher averages to

406

the haploids (Table 2). However the effect "gigas" was not observed to hybrids tri and

407

tetraploids, as reported in bulbophyllum ipanemense [59].

408

Significant effects on the ploidy level, and the anatomical and morphological

409

characteristics, such as leaf dry mass and thickness of the epidermis, have already

410

been reported in Brassicas [60] and characteristics such as leaf thickness and

411

photosynthetic rate, for rice [61]. The increase in the leaves thickness and total mass of

412

plants may result in greater energy expenditure, however, as the maze is a plant of

413

Kranz anatomy, there is not so much spent on histodifferentiation of juxtaposed layers

414

of palisade parenchyma, since these cells are found around the cells of the sheath of

415

the beam. Therefore the gain in leaf thickness would contribute not only to the increase

416

of the total mass of the leaf, but also to the increase of empty spaces. These spaces

417

play an important role in the CO2 reserve for photosynthesis and because it does not

418

require energy to histodifferentiation, being less costly in terms of energy.

419

The size of the cells and the thickness of the components were positively

420

correlated with the ploidy level also in potatoes [62]. With the increase of the genome,

421

the gigantism in cells and organs is widely observed and associated with the

422

increments in the photosynthetic rate [63]. The increase of photosynthesis is attributed

423

to the increase of the tissues, increased capacity for storage of CO2, and increase of

424

gs. The size of the epidermal cells, cells, can also be associated with the ploidy level of

425

the material under observation [47]. In addition to the increase in the activity of multiple

426

enzymes such as hydrolases and expansins [64].

427

The effect "giga" was also related in previous studies with modifications of cell

428

wall through a loosening, which enables a higher rate of growth of plants and

429

phenotypic changes. This loosening is assigned to a higher expression of genes of

430

expansin enzyme in rice [65,66], tobacco [67,68] and Arabidopsis [69,70]. The role of

431

expansins would be to induce the extent of cell wall, generating larger cells, higher

432

plants and longer roots. So in these cases, the cell expansion associated with the

433

ploidy is related to the increase of molecular signaling for synthesis of genes of

434

expansin and may lead to an increase in weight of structures, as in tomato [71].

435
436
437
438

Conclusions
The thickness of the leaf blade and the size of the stomata are highly heritable
traits in maize.

439

The obtained high accuracy validates the anatomical tool through the variables

440

studied in the present work, as a marker in the differentiation of ploidies in maize

441

plants, which may be employed in programs for selection of hybrids.

442

The anatomy made in young leaves of maze is a non-destructible technique

443

and in conjunction with the technique of flow cytometry, can be used as indirect method

444

in programs to obtain double haploids, in the initial stage of identification of seedlings.
