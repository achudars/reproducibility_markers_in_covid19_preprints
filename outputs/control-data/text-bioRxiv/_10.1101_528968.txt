Sex differences have been observed in multiple facets of cancer epidemiology, treatment and
biology, and in most cancers outside the sex organs. Efforts to link these clinical differences to
specific molecular features have focused on somatic mutations within the coding regions of the
genome. Here, we describe the first pan-cancer analysis of sex differences in whole genomes of
1,983 tumours of 28 subtypes from the ICGC Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project.
We both confirm the results of exome studies, and also uncover previously undescribed sex
differences. These include sex-biases in coding and non-coding cancer drivers, mutation
prevalence and strikingly, in mutational signatures related to underlying mutational processes.
These results underline the pervasiveness of molecular sex differences and strengthen the call
for increased consideration of sex in cancer research.

Sex disparities in cancer epidemiology include an increased overall cancer risk in males
corresponding with higher incidence in most tumor types, even after adjusting for known risk
factors1,2. Cancer mortality is also higher in males, due in part to better survival for female patients
in many cancer types, including those of the colon and head & neck3. Interestingly, female
colorectal cancer patients respond better to surgery4 and adjuvant chemotherapy, though this is
partially due to biases in tumour location and microsatellite instability5. Similarly, premenopausal
female nasopharyngeal cancer patients have improved survival regardless of tumour stage,
radiation or chemotherapy regimen6. There is a growing body of evidence for sex differences in
cancer genomics7-13, but their molecular origins and clinical implications remain largely elusive.

Previous studies have mostly focused on protein coding regions, leaving the vast majority of the
genome unexplored. We hypothesized that there are uncharacterized sex differences in the noncoding regions of the genome. Using whole genome sequencing data from the Pan-cancer
Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project14, we performed a survey of sex-biased mutations
in 1,983 samples (1,213 male, 770 female) from 28 tumour subtypes, excluding those of the sex
organs (Supplementary Table 1). We also excluded the X and Y chromosomes to focus on
autosomal sex differences in cancers affecting both men and women, but there are known to be
significant X-chromosome mutational differences between tumours arising in men and women15.
Our analysis revealed sex differences in both genome-wide phenomena and in specific genes.
These sex-biases occur not only at the pan-cancer level across all 1,983 samples, but also in
individual tumour subtypes.

We also identified tumour subtype-specific sex-biased driver mutations (Figure 1a, right).
Similarly to the pan-cancer driver analysis, we first identified putative sex-biases using proportions
tests and a 10% FDR threshold, and followed up with tumour subtype-specific logistic regression
models (model descriptions in Supplementary Table 1). CTNNB1 mutation frequency was sexbiased in liver hepatocellular cancer (Liver-HCC), again with more male-derived samples
harbouring CTNNB1 mutations: (male: 31%, female: 13%, 95% CI: 8.1-28%, prop-test q = 0.047,
LGR q = 8.2x10-3, Figure 1a, right). This mirrors our previous finding of sex-biased CTNNB1
mutation frequency in liver cancer from TCGA exome sequencing data, with similar effect sizes
(male: 33% vs. female: 12%11). The largest sex-disparity was in a non-coding driver event in
thyroid cancer (Thy-AdenoCA): TERT promoter mutations were observed in 64% of male-derived
samples compared with only 11% of female-derived samples (95% CI: 18-89%, prop-test q =

We began by investigating sex differences in driver gene mutation frequencies, focusing on 165
coding and nine non-coding mutation events16 (Supplementary Table 2). We used proportions
tests to identify candidate sex-biased events with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 10%.
These putative sex-biased events were then modeled using logistic regression (LGR) to adjust
for tumour subtype, ancestry and age (Online Methods). We found several sex-biased pancancer driver events, including CTNNB1 which was mutated in 5.0% more male-derived than
female-derived tumours (male: 7.6%, female: 2.7%, 95% CI: 2.9-7.0%, prop-test q = 3.6x10-4,
LGR q = 5.0 x 10-3; Figure 1a, left). ALB was also mutated in a larger proportion of male-derived
tumours (male: 3.2%, female: 0.54%, 95% CI: 1.4-3.9%, prop-test q = 0.0038, LGR q = 6.5 x 103
) while in contrast, PTCH1 (male: 0.44%, female: 2.0%, 95% CI: 0.38-2.8%, prop-test q = 0.028,
LGR q = 0.011) was mutated in more female-derived samples.

sex-biased events were detected, but were not statistically significant after multivariate
adjustment at present sample-sizes (Supplementary Table 2). These results demonstrate that
mutation of key cancer-driving genes is sex-biased both within and across specific tumour
subtypes.

Our previous work12 found sex biased mutation density across a number of tumour subtypes,
including cancers of the liver, kidney and skin. We therefore investigated mutation density here
to identify tumour subtypes where the cancer genomes of one sex accumulates more somatic
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) than those of the other sex, and whether these sex-biases might
be related to sex-biased driver gene mutation frequency. Returning to our statistical framework,
we first used univariate tests to identify putative sex-biases, and then applied multivariate linear
regression (LNR) on Box-cox transformed mutation load to adjust for possible confounders. The
Box-cox transformation applies a power function to modify the shape of a variable’s distribution
to better approximate a normal distribution (Online Methods). We also compared the total
number of somatic SNVs and further divided mutations by coding and non-coding SNVs to
determine whether sex-biases may be influenced by specific genomic contexts. Across all pancancer samples, we found higher mutation prevalence in male-derived samples in all three
contexts (coding: difference in location = 0.41 mut/Mbp, 95% CI = 0.28-0.54 mut/Mbp, u-test q =
2.2x10-10, LNR q = 7.5x10-4; non-coding: difference in location = 0.60 mut/Mbp, 95%CI = 0.430.80 mut/Mbp, u-test q = 7.9x10-11, LNR q = 6.5x10-4; overall: difference in location = 0.60
mut/Mbp, 95%CI = 0.42-0.79 mut/Mbp, u-test q = 7.5x10-11, LNR q= 1.9 x 10-6; Supplementary
Table 3). These sex-biases remained significant even after adjusting for tumour subtype, ancestry
and age in multivariate analysis (Figure 1b, left), demonstrating robust sex-biases in pan-cancer
mutation prevalence across different contexts.

We also investigated somatic SNV burden in each of the 23 individual tumour subtypes with at
least 15 samples, applying the same statistical approach with tumour subtype-specific models
(model descriptions in Supplementary Table 1). We found sex-biased mutation load in three
tumour subtypes (Figure 1b, right), with higher male coding mutation load in thyroid cancer
(difference in location = 0.26 mut/Mbp, 95%CI = 0.12-0.43 mut/Mbp, u-test q = 0.028, LNR q =
0.041), and higher male load in hepatocellular cancer and kidney renal cell cancer (Kidney-RCC)
in all three contexts (Supplementary Table 3). We compared the group rank differences of
coding and non-coding mutation load between the sexes and found that in renal cell cancer, the
differences were similar at 0.40 mut/Mbp for non-coding mutations and 0.37 mut/Mbp for coding
mutations. In hepatocellular cancer however, the median sex-difference in non-coding mutation
load was higher than the difference in coding mutation load (non-coding difference = 0.84
mut/Mbp vs. coding difference = 0.53 mut/Mbp). There is a similar effect in pan-cancer mutation
load (non-coding difference = 0.60 mut/Mbp vs coding difference = 0.41 mut/Mbp) suggesting
mutation context may play a role in sex-biased SNVs in some tumour subtypes.

To determine whether sex-biased mutation load may be associated with sex-biased driver gene
mutation frequency, we focused on each driver gene and investigated SNV burden in the relevant
tumour subtype. We did not find significant relationships between SNV burden and mutations in
PTCH1, ALB, CTNNB1 in pan-cancer analysis, nor was there an association for CTNNB1
mutation in hepatocellular cancer. In thyroid cancer however, TERT promoter mutation was

associated with increased coding mutation burden (medianTERT-wt = 0.26 mut/Mbp vs medianTERT-6
mut = 0.66 mut/Mbp, u-test p = 4.9x10 ). We used a linear regression model to determine if the
sex-bias in coding mutation load could be explained by TERT mutation frequency and found this
was indeed the case (linear regression pTERT = 2.4x10-5, psex = 0.37, Figure 1c). In addition, we
examined matched mutation timing data and found that of eleven samples with TERT promoter
mutations, nine of these were truncal events, suggesting that an early sex-bias in TERT promoter
mutation frequency is associated with sex-biased coding mutation load in this tumour subtype.
Indeed, mutations in all sex-biased driver genes were overwhelmingly truncal events.

We then asked if these driver mutations might occur at different stages of tumour evolution
between men and women, and started with tumour evolution structure. We compared the
proportions of polyclonal vs. monoclonal tumours between the sexes and did not find significant
sex differences in the proportions of polyclonal tumours bearing mutations in PTCH1, ALB or
CTNNB1 for sex-biased pan-cancer drivers, or in TERT promoter-mutated samples in thyroid
cancer (Supplementary Figure 1). We did detect a putative bias in the proportion of polyclonal
CTNNB1-mutated samples in hepatocellular cancer (80% of male-derived samples are polyclonal
vs. 46% of female-derived samples, 95%CI = -0.019 – 0.70, prop-test p = 0.039), and accounted
for polyclonality when comparing the timings of the mutations in these driver events. On
subsequently examining the frequency of clonal vs. subclonal driver mutation events between the
sexes, we found that while there were differences in the proportions of truncal mutations (eg:
100% of TERT promoter mutations were truncal events in male-derived vs. 50% truncal events in
female-derived thyroid cancer patients), no comparisons were statistically significant.

Broadening beyond sex-biased driver mutations, we expanded our clonality analysis to perform
a general survey of clonal structure and mutation timing across all tumour subtypes and mutations
(Supplementary Table 4). We found that female-derived biliary adenocarcinoma (BiliaryAdenoCA) tumours were frequently polyclonal, while most male-derived tumours were
monoclonal (26% male-derived samples are polyclonal vs. 80% female-derived, 95% CI = 19 –
88%, prop-test q = 0.063, LGR q = 0.024; Figure 1d). In addition, we found intriguing evidence
suggesting there may be sex-differences in the mutation timing of structural variants in this tumour
subtype. Structural variants (SVs) in male-derived samples tended to be truncal events more
frequently than in female-derived samples (median male percent truncal SVs = 100% vs. median
female = 82%, u-test q = 0.081, LNR q = 0.024; Figure 1e). Though other comparisons did not
reach our statistical significance threshold, we found some interesting trends that may merit future
study, including in esophageal cancer (Eso-AdenoCA) where SVs in female-derived samples
were more frequently truncal events while SVs in male-derived samples occurred more frequently
in subclones (median male percent truncal SVs = 55%, median female = 100%; Supplementary
Figure 2), and in medulloblastoma, where insertion-deletions (indels) were more frequently
truncal events in female-derived samples than male (median male percent of truncal indels =
65%, median female proportion of truncal indels = 70%; Supplementary Figure 3). Our analysis
of sex differences in tumour evolution identified some sex-biased events and also hint at putative
sex-biases that should be further explored in future analyses.

Sex-biases in genome instability and CNAs
Next, we examined percent genome altered (PGA), which provides a summary of copy number
aberration (CNA) load. A proxy for genome instability, PGA is a complementary measure of

mutation density to somatic SNV burden. While we did not find associations between sex and
autosome-wide PGA, we observed sex-biases in the copy number burden for specific
chromosomes (Figure 2a). In pan-cancer analysis, male-derived samples exhibited a slight but
significant higher percent chromosome altered for chromosome 7 even after accounting for
tumour subtype, ancestry and age using linear regression (median male PGA-7 = 5.4%, median
female PGA-7 = 0.37%, difference in location = 0.0037%, 95%CI = 9.4x10-4–2.4x10-3%, u-test =
5.0x10-3, LNR q = 0.027; Supplementary Table 5). In individual tumour subtypes, we found sexbiased PGA in renal cell cancer (chromosomes 7 & 12) and hepatocellular cancer (chromosomes
1 & 16). By looking at copy number gains and losses separately, we additionally identified
chromosomes with sex-biases in the burden of copy number gains and losses (Supplementary
Figure 4, Supplementary Table 5), including sex-biased percent copy gained on chromosomes
5, 8 and 17 in pan-cancer samples.

We next compared CNA frequency on the gene level to identify genes lost or gained at sex-biased
rates. Across all pan-cancer samples, we found 4,285 sex-biased genes across 15 chromosomes
(Figure 2b, Supplementary Tables 6 & 7, LGR q-value < 10%). These genes were all more
frequently gained in male-derived samples than female with a difference in copy number gain
frequency reaching ~10% on chromosomes 7 and 8. Genes with male-dominated copy number
gains include the oncogenes MYC (male gain frequency = 37% vs. female gain frequency = 28%,
95% CI = 5.2-14%, prop-test q = 2.5x10-3, LGR q = 0.068) and ERBB2 (male gain frequency =
21% vs. female gain frequency = 16%, 4.7%, 95% CI = 1.1-8.3%, prop-test q = 0.041, LGR q =
0.088). The driver CTNNB1 was also more frequently gained in male samples (male gain
frequency = 8.9% vs. female gain frequency = 5.2%, 95% CI = 1.4-6.1%, prop-test q = 0.016,
LGR q = 0.053), mirroring our finding of higher male pan-cancer mutation frequency on the SNV
level for this oncogene. We did not find pan-cancer sex-biased copy number losses.

We repeated this analysis for every tumour subtype independently and found sex-biased CNAs
in renal cell and hepatocellular cancer (Supplementary Tables 6 & 7). In renal cell cancer, the
1,986 sex-biased gains all occurred more frequently in male-derived samples, with differences in
frequency up to 35% (Figure 2c). They spanned across chromosomes 7 and 12, agreeing with
our finding of male-dominated genome instability in these chromosomes (Figure 2a,
Supplementary Figure 4). In contrast to the male-dominated gain pan-cancer and renal cell
findings, we found higher female frequency of copy number losses in hepatocellular cancer
(Figure 2d). We identified 2,610 genes with higher copy number loss rates in female-derived
samples. As observed in renal cell cancer, some of these losses span whole chromosomes, in
this case chromosomes 3 and 16. Other sex-biased losses were found only across one
chromosome arm (1p, 4q) or as focal events (eg. PCDH9 on chromosome 13). The sex-biased
gene-level events on chromosomes 1 and 16 agreed with the sex-biased genome instability
findings but on returning to the PGA analysis, we found that chromosomes 3 and 4 had trending
sex-biased genome instability (u-test q < 0.2, Figure 1a, Supplementary Table 5), suggesting
that sex-biased PGA may guide identification of sex-biased CNAs on the gene level.

203
204
205
206

Thus, using sex-biased PGA as a guide, we more closely examined regions of interest in tumour
subtypes of that did not have sex-biased CNAs in our general CNA analysis, but did have possible
sex-biased genome instability (u-test q < 0.2): biliary cancer, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(Lymph-BNHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Lymph-CLL) and melanoma (Skin-Melanoma).

We found an additional 203 genes on the p-arm of chromosome 8 that were more frequently lost
in female-derived samples in biliary cancer (Supplementary Figure 5). These copy number
losses were 50% more common in female-derived samples and affect genes such as DLC1, a
known tumour suppressor in hepatocellular cancer that is thought to play a similar role in
gallbladder cancer18. While we did not identify additional sex-biased CNAs in non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or melanoma, the sex-biased PGA results suggest
these as regions of interest for future work. Thus in addition to sex-biased SNV events, we also
identified sex-biased CNAs from this whole genome sequencing data.

At the pan-cancer level, we found eight signatures that occurred more frequently in one sex over
the other (Figure 3a, Supplementary Table 8). In particular, SBS1 was more common in femalederived samples (89% of male-derived vs. 97% of female-derived, χ2-test q = 3.9x10-10, LGR q =
5.1x10-7) and was also associated with a higher percentage of mutations in these samples (male
median percent mutations attributed to SBS1 = 8.4%, female median = 10%, u-test q =0.026,
LNR q = 0.021). SBS1 is thought to be caused by deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine,
resulting in base substitutions. Though it is correlated with age, our multivariate model accounts
for this variable and the sex-bias remains even adjusting for age. SBS40 was also detected in a
larger proportion of female-derived samples (42% of male-derived vs. 52% of female-derived, χ2test q = 1.7x10-4, LNR q = 0.08), though we did not find a difference in the percentage of attributed
mutations (u-test q = 0.17). Other sex-biased SBS signatures include SBS16, SBS17a and
SBS17b, which were all more frequently detected in male-derived samples, and SBS40, which
was more frequent in female-derived samples. These signatures are of unknown aetiology.

One ID signature was detected at different rates between the sexes, and two ID signatures had
different rates of attributed mutations. ID8 occurred more frequently in male-derived samples
(53% of male-derived vs. 47% of female-derived, χ2-test q = 0.068, LGR q = 0.018) though there
was no difference in the percentage of mutations attributed to either signature. The aetiology
underlying ID8 is not known, but this signature is thought to be associated with double strand
break repair where ID8-asosciated mutations resemble those related to radiation-induced
damage. Conversely, ID1 and ID5 were detected at similar frequencies between the sexes, but
had higher percentages of attributed mutations in female-derived samples. Mutations associated

We hypothesized that sex differences in mutation load and tumour evolution characteristics may
be driven by varying mutational processes. In addition to single base substitution (SBS)
signatures, which have been well annotated and linked to tumour aetiology19,20, we also examined
doublet base substitution (DBS) and small insertion-deletion (ID) signatures. Sex differences in a
mutational signature could shine insight on molecular differences between the sexes. For each of
47 validated PCAWG SBS, 11 DBS, and 17 ID signatures21, we performed a two-stage analysis.
We first compared the proportions of signature-positive samples between the sexes; that is, we
looked at the proportions of samples with any mutations attributed to the signature to determine
whether there was a relationship between each signature and sex. Then, we focused on
signature-positive samples and compared the percentage of mutations attributed to each
signature between the sexes. For both analyses, we used univariate techniques to identify
putative events and adjusted for additional variables using linear models.

defective DNA mismatch repair, suggesting that while male- and female-derived tumours harbour
defective DNA repair at similar rates, it is responsible for a larger proportion of mutations in

Since mutational processes are disease-specific, we repeated the mutational signatures analysis
in each tumour subtype, again by first using univariate techniques to find putatively sex-biased
signatures, and then using linear models to adjust for age and ancestry. We identified six sexbiased signatures in hepatocellular cancer (Figure 3b, Supplementary Table 8). Similar to our
pan-cancer finding, we again detected female-dominated bias in the proportion of SBS1-positive
samples (58% of male-derived vs. 88% of female-derived, χ2-test q = 3.5x10-5, LGR q = 9.2x10-6)
male-dominated bias in and SBS16 (16% of male-derived vs. 2.2% of female-derived, χ2 q =
9.6x10-3, LGR q = 6.4x10-3). There were four sex-biased ID signatures in this tumour subtype: ID3
(94% of male-derived vs. 81% of female-derived, χ2-test q = 5.2x10-3, LGR q = 3.8x10-3), ID8
(93% of male-derived vs. 78.7% of female-derived, χ2-test q = 3.7x10-3, LGR q = 3.8x10-3) and
ID11 (17% of male-derived vs. 1.1% of female-derived, χ2-test q = 3.7x10-3, LGR q = 6.4x10-3)
occurred more frequently in male-derived samples. While ID1 was detected at similar rates
between the sexes, a greater proportion of ID1-attributed mutations were found in female-derived
than male-derived samples (male median percent mutations attributed to ID1 = 21%, female
median = 27%, u-test q = 2.0x10-5, LR q = 2.2x10-6). As previously described, SBS1 and ID1 are
associated with base deamination and defective DNA mismatch repair. ID3 is associated with
tobacco smoke, and ID8 with double-stranded break repair. Taken together, sex-biases in the
aetiology underlying the molecular landscape of hepatocellular cancer begin to emerge. In this
tumour subtype, spontaneous or enzymatic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine and
defective mismatch repair occur more frequently in female patients and are also responsible for
more mutations. Conversely, tobacco smoking is more common in male patients though the
number of mutations attributed to tobacco smoke is not different between the sexes; this leads to
more tobacco-associated male hepatocellular tumours.

In B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we identified a significant difference in the proportion of samples
with SBS17b-attributed mutations (Figure 3c, Supplementary Table 8). More male-derived
samples had mutations associated with this signature of unknown aetiology (57% of male-derived
vs. 25% of female-derived, χ2-test q = 0.051, LGR q = 6.3x10-4). There were also several intriguing
sex-differences in mutational signatures that did not meet our significance threshold. For instance,
DBS2 accounts for a higher percentage of mutations in male-derived samples (male median
percent mutations attributed to DBS2 = 50%, female median = 33%, Supplementary Table 8).
DBS2’s association with tobacco smoking suggests that future insight in this signature may
provide molecular explanations for the sex-specific associations between smoking and thyroid
cancer risk22. As the aetiologies of these mutational signatures become better known, we can
better approach the causes of molecular sex differences underlying cancer aetiology and
progression. In particular, we may be able to discern environmental and lifestyle factors even in
the absence of reported data, and connect known risk factors with newly described mutational
processes.

Finally, to ensure that our findings were not skewed by differences in sequencing quality, we
checked for sex-biases in quality control (QC) metrics. These included comparing the coverage,

percentage of paired reads mapping to different chromosomes, and overall quality summary of
both tumour and normal genomes. We mirrored our main analyses and used u-tests or χ2 tests
and linear modeling to check each QC metric. We did not find sex-biases in any QC metric in pancancer or tumour subtype analysis after multiple adjustment except in raw somatic mutation
calling (SMC) coverage. SMC coverage was higher in male-derived samples in six tumour
subtypes including thyroid cancer and esophageal cancer, and was higher in female-derived
samples in lung adenocarcinoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Supplementary Table 9).
While we do not find sex differences in comparing the SMC coverage pass/fail rates using a
recommended minimum of 2.6 gigabases covered, it is prudent to consider sex-biased SMC in
relation to our findings. There are also no sex-differences in the proportions of samples passing
quality checks for any other QC metric (Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Figures 6).

Our analysis of whole genome sequencing data from the PCAWG project uncovered sex
differences in the largely unexplored non-coding autosomal genome. We found these biases in
measures of mutational load, tumour evolution, mutational signatures, and at the gene level.
While the majority of our findings describe pan-cancer differences, we have also uncovered an
intriguing glimpse into tumour subtype-specific differences. These tumour subtype-specific results
are limited by subtype sample size, and limited available annotation restricts the ability to account
for confounding variables. It is important to consider these results in context of the multivariable
models used, which do not directly capture characteristics such as tobacco smoking history or
tumour stage at diagnosis. Future increases in sample size and robust associated annotation will
allow for the detection of smaller effects and the control of more confounders. Nevertheless, our
analyses of driver genes and copy number alterations suggest functional impacts of genomic sexbiases on the transcriptome and tumorigenesis. By using signatures to distinguish between
mutations attributed to lifestyle factors such as smoking, we can better describe sex differences
related to biological factors such as hormone activity. And despite low tumour subtype-specific
sample numbers, our mutation timing and mutational signatures findings at both the pan-cancer
and tumour-subtype level hint at underlying mutational processes that may give rise to molecular
sex-biases. Combined with our previous work in whole exome sequencing, we present a
landscape of sex-biases in cancer genomics and mutational processes (Figure 4,
Supplementary Figure 7).

It is becoming clear that sex differences occur across many mutation classes and the portrait of
differences for each tumour subtype is a unique reflection of active mutational processes and
tumour evolution. We have performed here the first pan-cancer analysis of sex differences in
whole genome sequencing data and catalogued previously undescribed sex-biases. However,
increased study of molecular sex differences in future large-scale sequencing efforts is needed
to strengthen the findings we present here, to determine why men and women have molecularly
different tumours, and to determine how this information can be leveraged to improve patient care.

General Statistical Framework
We followed a statistical approach as previously described in our previous work (Li et al). Briefly,
for each genomic feature of interest, we used univariate tests first followed by false discovery rate
(FDR) adjustment to identify putative sex-biases of interest (q < 0.1). Here, we use non-parametric
univariate tests to minimize assumptions on the data. For putative sex-biases, we then follow up
the univariate analysis with multivariate modeling to account for potential confounders using
bespoke models for each tumour subtype. Model variables for each tumour context are described
in Supplementary Table 1 and were included based on availability of data (<15% missing),
sufficient variability (at least two levels) and collinearity. Discrete data was modeled using logistic
regression. Continuous data was first transformed using the Box-Cox family and modeled using
linear regression. The Box-Cox family of transformations is a formalized method to select a power
transformation to better approximate a normal-like distribution and stabilize variance. We used
the Yeo-Johnson extension to the Box-Cox transformation that allows for zeros and negative
values23:

Driver Event Analysis
We focused on driver events described by the PCAWG consortium16. Driver mutation data was
binarized to indicate presence or absence of the driver event in each patient. Proportions of
mutated genes were compared between the sexes using proportions tests for univariate analysis.
A q-value threshold of 0.1 was used to select genes for further multivariate analysis using binary
logistic regression. FDR correction was again applied and genes with significant pan-cancer sex
terms were extracted from the models (q-value < 0.1). Driver event analysis was performed
separately for pan-cancer analysis and for each tumour subtype.

Subclonal structure and mutation timing calls were downloaded from Synapse
(https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8532425). Subclonal structure data was binarized from
number of subclonal clusters per sample to monoclonal (one cluster) or polyclonal (more than
one cluster). The proportion of polyclonal samples was calculated per sex and compared using
proportion tests for both pan-cancer and tumour subtype analysis. The univariate p-values were
FDR adjusted across all tumour subtypes to identify putatively sex-biased clonal structure. These
cases were further scrutinized using logistic regression. A multivariate q-value threshold of 0.1
was used to determine statistically significant sex-biased clonal structure.

485

Mutation timing data classified SNVs, indels and SVs into clonal (truncal) or subclonal groups.

486

The proportion of truncal variants was calculated for each mutation type (

to obtain proportions of truncal SNVs, indels and SVs for each sample. These proportions were
compared between the sexes using two-sided Mann-Whitney U-tests and univariate p-values
were FDR adjusted to identify putatively sex-biased mutation timing. Linear regression was used
to adjust for confounding factors and a multivariate q-value threshold of 0.1 was used to determine
statistically significant sex-biased mutation timing. The mutation timing analysis was performed
separately for SNVs, indels and SVs.

Coding mutation prevalence only considers the coding regions of the genome, and noncoding
prevalence only considers the noncoding regions. Mutation load was compared between the
sexes using Mann-Whitney U-tests for both pan-cancer and tumour-type specific analysis.
Comparisons with u-test q-values meeting an FDR threshold of 10% were further analyzed using

data
was

from
Synapse
(https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8042880). Ploidy-adjusted calls were used to identify
segments with copy number gains and losses. The number of bases in copy number gained or
lost segments were summed per chromosome and divided by chromosome size to obtain percent
chromosome gained and lost, respectively. All segments affected by a copy number aberration
were also summed and treated in the same way to calculate percent chromosome altered.
Percent copy number gained, lost, and altered were also calculated over the autosomes. These
metrics were compared in pan-cancer and tumour-subtype analysis using u-tests to identify
putatively sex-biased chromosome and genome instability, and putatively sex-biased events were
further analysed using linear regression modeling. Genome instability analysis was performed
separately for each tumour subtype with FDR adjustment performed over percent copy gained,
loss and altered comparisons together.

Consensus copy number data was processed to gain/neutral/loss calls per gene. The number of
loss, neutral and gain calls were summed per sex, and assessed using univariate and multivariate
techniques. For univariate analysis, proportional differences between the sexes for gains and
losses were tested for each gene using proportions tests. After identifying candidate pan-cancer
univariately significant genes, multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust ternary CNA data
for sex, age, ancestry and tumour-type. The genome-spanning analysis was performed
separately for losses and gains for each tumour subtype.

The number of mutations attributed to each SBS, DBS and ID signature per sample was
downloaded from Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8366024). For each
signature, we compared the proportion of samples with any mutations attributed to the signatures
(“signature-positive”) using χ2-square tests to identify univariately significant sex-biases.
Signatures with putative sex-biases were further analysed using logistic regression.

We also compared the proportions of mutations attributed to each signature. The numbers of
mutations per signature were divided by total number of mutations for each sample to obtain the
proportion of mutations attributed to the signature. Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to compare
these proportions. Putative sex-biased signatures were further analysed using linear regression
after Box-cox adjustment.

Signatures that were not detected in a tumour subtype was omitted from analysis for that tumour
subtype. Statistical analyses were performed for each set tumour subtype, but combining all SBS,
DBS and ID signatures.

Statistical Analysis & Data Visualization
All statistical analyses and data visualization were performed in the R statistical environment
(v3.4.3) using the BPG24 (v5.9.8), car (v3.0-2) and mlogit (v0.2-4), packages.
