Cytoplasm is densely packed with macromolecules causing cellular crowding, which alters interactions inside cells and differs between biological systems. Here we investigate the impact of
crowding on microtubule cytoskeleton organization. Using mathematical modelling, we find that
only anisotropic crowding affects the mean microtubule direction, but any crowding reduces the
number of microtubules that form bundles. We validate these predictions in vivo using Drosophila
follicular epithelium. Since cellular components are transported along microtubules, our results
identify cellular crowding as a novel regulator of this transport and cell organization.
Subject Areas: Biological Physics, Complex Systems, Interdisciplinary Physics

Distribution of different components inside cells is cru- 54
cial for cellular, and therefore, organism function. In or- 55
der for organelles to be delivered to their corresponding 56
biologically relevant locations inside the cell, they are 57
transported via vehicles (motor proteins) along tracks 58
(microtubule cytoskeleton). The microtubules (MTs) 59
forming these tracks are polarized and highly dynamic 60
filaments [1], as their plus-ends undergo dynamic insta- 61
bility. In particular, MTs are either growing or shrink- 62
ing and can switch between the two states. Despite this 63
highly dynamic behavior of individual MTs, they self- 64
organize into a network, the dynamics of which reaches 65
a steady-state. This steady state is often driven by cell- 66
scale features, e.g. cell geometry and spatial distribution 67
of MT stable minus-ends [2–4].
68
The properties of the MT network are crucial for cell 69
function. In particular, the mean MT direction is linked 70
to the large-scale direction of transport and cytoplasmic 71
flows [5–7]. The efficacy of intracellular transport ad- 72
ditionally depends on the MT bundling, which occurs 73
in many experimental systems [8]. It is defined as the 74
case when two or more MTs are closely apposed, often 75
connected by cross-linking proteins [9]. The presence of 76
bundling promotes the transport by increasing the prob- 77
ability of a motor protein reattachment to a MT upon 78
fall-off [10, 11].
79
However, the MT network does not exist in isola- 80
tion, but rather in a crowded cytoplasm densely packed 81
with biopolymers [12]. This dense packing with macro- 82
molecules can make the cell interior either isotropic 83
or anisotropic [12–15]. The significance of cytoplasmic 84
crowding is seen in protein folding, where it speeds up 85
transition-limited reactions while slowing down diffusion- 86
limited reactions [13, 16]. Additionally, the crowding cre- 87
ates potential barriers to growing MTs. The only model 88
to date that considers the MTs in the context of crowd- 89
ing analyzes the creation of traffic jams by kinesin-8 [17], 90
whereas the effects of crowding on MTs themselves re- 91
main unknown. In this paper we focus on how cellular 92

crowding and its anisotropy affect MT self-organization.
To address this, we combine stochastic simulations, analytical models and in vivo experiments. We model cellular crowding as barriers in the cytoplasm, where their
positions are either statistically isotropic or anisotropic,
and homogeneous or discrete. We discover that all barrier types reduce MT bundling, whereas only anisotropic
barriers alter their main direction. We validate our predictions in vivo using Drosophila follicular epithelium at
late stages of oogenesis [18–20]. Altogether, we demonstrate that cellular crowding and its directionality impact
on the MT network organization and should be considered when studying MT-related processes in cells.
Model. — As cellular crowding is a universal phenomenon, we turn to a system in which MTs can be
modelled without excessive oversimplification. In the epithelial tissue, one of the four major tissue types [3], the
cortical MTs are restricted to the thin 1µm quasi-2d subapical layer (Fig.1a, [2]). This allows to model cells as 2d
convex domains, in which MTs grow from points on the
boundary ζ into the interior (Fig.1b, [21, 22]) at an angle
θ (or φ) with respect to the boundary (or the horizontal). All the mathematical model results are presented
on elliptical cells, since it is the average cell shape for a
given eccentricity [4].
We represent individual MTs as 1d filaments and
their dynamic instability via a Markov chain (Fig.1c,
[2, 4, 23]), with the of growth α, depolymerization β, rescue α0 and catastrophe β 0 (Fig.1c). We set the base rates
(α, β, α0 , β 0 ) = (1000, 3500, 4, 1) (as in [4]) and change
the catastrophe rate β 0 depending on the nature of barriers. We assume that crowding does not alter the tubulin concentration in the cytoplasm, and hence α or α0 ,
whereas the depolymerization rate β is independent of
it [24]. Upon fully depolymerizing, the MT switches to
growing at the rescue rate α0 .
We choose the simplest angle-dependent model of MT
interactions (Fig.1d, [2]). When a polymerizing MT encounters an existing one at an angle θM T , it can grow

To systematically study cellular crowding, we exam-151
ine four barrier placement scenarios named after the ter-152
minology in turbulence. (1) Isotropic homogeneous153
(Fig.1e): the simplified limiting case with small biopoly-154
mers, whose distribution is homogeneous and isotropic,155
is modeled by uniformly increasing the base value of the156
catastrophe rate β 0 . (2) Isotropic discrete (Fig.1f):157
when the biopolymers are not aligned, but their distri-158

b
(3) Anisotropic homogeneous (Fig.1g): when the
biopolymers are aligned, but in the limiting case of being very close to each other, they are modeled as a
barrier field at an angle θb . Here the catastrophe rate
β̃ 0 (ψ) = | cos ψ|β 0 + | sin ψ|αpb /(1 − pb ) depends on the
angle between the MTs and the barriers ψ = φ − θb , inαpb
when MTs
creasing from the base rate β 0 to the 1−p
b
are perpendicular to the barriers. (4) Anisotropic discrete (Fig.1h): The barriers, e.g. actin cables, separated
by δ are placed at the angle θb with respect to the horizontal, and the MTs collapse at barriers with the probability pb . Since the time-scale of the barrier dynamics
in vivo (e.g. actin cables) is much longer than the MT
growth cycle (15sec, [2]), we model them as stationary.
Microtubule organization. — For reported parameter
ranges of β 0 ([4] and the references therein), the MT organization is not affected by isotropic crowding (Fig.2a,b),
since homogeneous crowding is the limiting case of infinitely close random barriers, and the MT organization
is not sensitive to uniformly changing β 0 [4]. Since β 0 has
not been measured for crowding scenarios, we investigated increased pb corresponding to β 0 much higher than
the reported range. This progressively weakened the effect of cell geometry [2, 4], reducing MT alignment with
the cell major axis (Fig.2a,b β 0 = 5).
By contrast, anisotropic crowding introduces competition between the cell geometry and barriers: the former
aligns the MTs along the cell major axis, and the latter
along the direction of anisotropy (Fig.2c,d). Since the
MT angle distribution does not depend on the interaction parameters (θc , pcat ) (see SI, Fig.S1), we used the

depending on the crowding scenario. For both cases of
homogeneous and discrete barriers, we altered the barrier strength pb for non-elongated and elongated cells
(ecc = 0.7 and ecc = 0.98), while keeping (α, β, α0 ) and
(pcat , θc ), constant (Fig.1g,h). For weak barriers, the MT
angle distribution is determined by the cell shape, with
its peak at the cell major axis angle (90o ). With increasing barrier strength, the MTs progressively align with
the anisotropy. The rate of this transition depends on
the cell geometry and the barrier strength. For elongated cells the effect of the geometry is stronger than for
the non-elongated ones, and the MTs align with the cell
major axis for larger pb . Since the continuous crowding is

measure: MT bundling, by counting MTs which zip along
each other. Finally, we validated the model of discrete
anisotropic barriers in vivo on the Drosophila follicular
epithelium.
We found that only anisotropic crowding affects the
direction of MT network. This is due to the competition
between the cell geometry aligning it along the cell major
axis [2, 4] and anisotropic crowding redirecting it along
itself, where the geometry effect is stronger for more elongated cells. The orientation of the MT network directs
intracellular transport [5–7], which in some biological systems is required to be other than the cell major axis. For
example, in the follicular epithelium the transmembrane
protein Fat2 accumulates along the boundaries parallel
to the cell major axis [29]. This localization depends on
MTs [19, 29], suggesting the need for their reorientation
for the efficient delivery of Fat2 to produce a viable egg.
Therefore, cellular crowding anisotropy provides a powerful tool for a cell to redirect the transport and perform
its correct function.
We showed both in vivo and in silico that cellular
crowding reduces bundling. How this alters efficacy of
intracellular trafficking by molecular motors remains an
open question, as bundling can both increase and decrease trafficking by, first, reducing the overall MT density in the cytoplasm, while increasing the probability of
motor re-attachment after a fall-of a MT, thus facilitating the cargo reaching the cell boundary. In summary,
cellular crowding, though often overlooked, is an important contributor to MT self-organization, and thus to the
correct cellular organization and function.
