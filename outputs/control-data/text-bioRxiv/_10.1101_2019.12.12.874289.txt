Abstract
Drebrin-like protein (DBN-1) in C. elegans is an adaptor protein that connects
different cellular pathways to the actin cytoskeleton. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 system, we
generated a new dbn-1 allele, which lacks 80% of C-terminal part of DBN-1. The mutant
displays a striking hyper-bending locomotion phenotype and body posture with two times
stronger curvature than wild type. We show by atomic force microscopy that the muscle tone
of the mutant remains unaffected. Aiming to track down the cause of hyper-bending, we
performed genetic epistasis experiments. We found that mutations in the Rho-specific
guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain of UNC-73 (Trio), pan-neuronal
expression of dominant negative RHO-1 and mutations in NCA (NALCN) cation leak
channels all suppressed hyper-bending in the dbn-1 mutant. These data indicate that DBN-1
negatively regulates the activity of both NCA-1 and NCA-2 channels, opposing RHO-1 in the

non-canonical Gq pathway. We conclude that DBN-1 is an important component of the
neuronal signaling cascade that controls the degree of C. elegans body bending during
locomotion.

Introduction
C. elegans nematodes move over firm substrates lying on their side and bending their
body in sinusoidal waves 1, 2. The bending results from alternating contractions and
relaxations of ventral and dorsal groups of body-wall muscles 3. Muscle contraction is
controlled by the activity of excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons: excitation of cholinergic
neurons induces muscles contraction at one side of the body while at the same time, these
neurons excite inhibitory GABA neurons relaxing muscles on the opposite side of the body 4,
5

. The force produced by body-wall muscles is transmitted via dense bodies to the underlying

elastic cuticle driving the movement of the entire animal 6.
One of the central roles in the regulation of neuronal activity that controls C. elegans
locomotion is played by NCA sodium leak channels. NCA/NALCN channels are
nonselective, voltage independent, and do not inactivate. Providing the dominant basal
sodium leak conductance, they set the resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability 7.
The NCA conductance mediates propagation of neuronal activity from the cell bodies to
synapses and synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junctions required for normal
locomotion 8, 9. The NLF-1 (NCA localization factor-1) protein delivers NCA channels to the
plasma membrane 10 where several signal transduction pathways regulate their activity. The
M3 muscarinic receptor and the TACR1 (G-protein-coupled receptor for substance P) both
activate conductance through NALCN channels via the Src tyrosine kinase-dependent
pathway 11, 12. Another set of GPCRs, the CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor), GABA-BR
(gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor) and D2R (dopamine receptor) inhibits NALCN

activity 13, 14. In addition, NALCN modulates neuronal membrane potential in co-operation
with potassium channels and gap junction hemichannels 15, 16. Recently, a new pathway
regulating NCA channels in C. elegans was discovered 17, 18, 19. It was found that the
heteromeric Gq protein activates UNC-73/ RhoGEF Trio, which subsequently activates the
small GTPase RHO-1. RHO-1 then acts via an unknown mechanism to activate the NCA ion
channels 17.
Drebrin-like protein (known as mAbp1, HIP-55, SH3P7, DBNL, and DBN-1 in C.
elegans) is an adaptor protein that mediates between the actin cytoskeleton and proteins of
different intracellular pathways 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Drebrin-like protein is, for example, an
important component of the endocytic machinery. Being selectively recruited at the late stage
of the formation of clathrin-coated pits, it directly interacts with dynamin, mediating vesicle
scission 25, 26, 27. Elimination of the mAbp1 in mice results in moderate reduction of both
receptor-mediated and synaptic endocytosis and in a severe impairment of synaptic vesicle
recycling. This presynaptic defect is associated with restricted physical capabilities and
disturbed neuromotoric behavior of the animals. In particular, they display ruffled up fur,
muscle trembling, convulsions, partial paralysis of the hind limbs, and strongly reduced fine
motor coordination 28. The molecular pathways underlying these defects are not clear.
C. elegans drebrin-like protein DBN-1 was first described as a sarcomere component
of the body-wall muscle cells regulating actin filament dynamics during muscle contraction 29.
To further analyze the function of DBN-1, we here generated a new dbn-1 allele (vit7) which
harbors a premature stop codon within the ADF-H domain of dbn-1. Surprisingly, worms
bearing the vit7 mutation acquired larger than usual body curvature variations resulting in
unusually strong bending during locomotion. We succeeded in tracking down the molecular
mechanisms of the hyper-bending phenotype of the dbn-1(vit7) mutant, and identified C.
elegans drebrin-like protein DBN-1 as an essential regulator of NCA cation leak channel
activity.

Results
The vit7 is a loss-of-function mutation
To generate the new dbn-1 allele, designated vit7, we applied Crispr/Cas9 technology
of genome editing. The target was chosen within the third exon to be as close as possible to
the start codon within the coding sequence and to contain a GG motif adjacent to the PAM
sequence to enhance successful genome editing 30. The edited allele was designated vit7.
Sequencing of dbn-1(vit7) genomic DNA confirmed precise targeting and showed a 16 base
deletion within the third exon of the K08E3.4 gene (Fig. 1 A and B). This deletion resulted in
an open-reading-frame shift, leading to the appearance of a premature stop codon. If the
mutant protein were stably expressed in vivo, it would consist of the 134 N-terminal amino
acids of DBN-1, containing the largest part of the ADF-H domain (Fig. 1 C). To analyze
protein expression in vit7, we generated guinea pig polyclonal antibodies specific against the
ADF-H domain of DBN-1 and performed western blot analysis of mutant worm lysate. While
these antibodies recognized the ADF-H domain of DBN-1 expressed from an
extrachromosomal array, the corresponding band of truncated DBN-1 in the vit7 mutant was
extremely weak or not detectable (Fig. 1 D). This result suggests that truncated DBN-1 was
expressed in vit7 in vivo, but appeared to be not stable and prone to degradation. Based on this
result, we classify vit7 as a severe loss-of-function allele.

The vit7 mutant displays a hyper-bending locomotion phenotype
When crawling on laboratory plate, wild-type C. elegans displays a characteristic
sinusoidal movement pattern (Fig. 2, A). The wavelength and amplitudes of body bends are
highly conserved quantities among wild-type C. elegans individuals, across mutants, and
across different species 31, 32. The dbn-1(vit7) mutant worms could be easily distinguished by
their strong body curvature and hyper-bending locomotion (Supplementary Movie 1). We
recorded and analyzed forward movements of individual worms in the L4 stage by video
microscopy and image processing (Fig. 2). When placed on a fresh nematode growth media
(NGM) plate with a thin lawn of E. coli OP50, vit7 mutants moved displaying 17.4 ± 3.6 body
bends in 20 seconds, significantly less than wild type worms which showed 22.2 ± 4.4 body
bends in the same time interval (P < 0,001) (Fig. 2 B). The vit7 mutants advanced forward on
their tracks on average by about one third of their body length per second (with a maximum
velocity of half a body length per second) similar to wild type (Fig. 2 C, 4 C, 5 C, 6 C).
Mutant animals did thus neither appear to be significantly sluggish nor hyperactive, and their
decreased body bend rate resulted rather from hyper-bending. To quantitatively characterize
the bending motions of the mutants, we analyzed their body curvature parameters during
movement (Fig. 2 D). The mean squared curvature of the body axis of vit7 mutants (1.78 ±
0.4 × 10-4 1/m2 ) was two times larger than that of the wild type (0.9 ± 0.2 × 10-4 1/m2)
(Fig. 2 E). This result leads us to conclude that DBN-1 is involved in the control of body
curvature of C. elegans, limiting their degree of bending during locomotion.

The vit7 mutant maintains normal average muscle tone
We hypothesized that the hyper-bending phenotype of the dbn-1(vit7) mutant might be
associated with a changed muscle tone. To test this hypothesis, we used atomic force
microscopy to quantify the elastic resistance of the shell-like muscular envelope of the worm
body to lateral indentation with a blunt tip. To perform this experiment, we immobilized
single worms onto an agar pad by gluing their heads and tails to the surface and then gently
indented their bodies with a micron-sized bead attached to an AFM cantilever (Fig. 3 A). The
average stiffness of the worm’s muscle shell was calculated from measurements at several
different points along the worm’s body. Using a relatively small bead, compared to the
dimensions of the worm (tip radius 7 µm << radius of the worm) ensures that the measured
resistance is dominated by the outer shell (composed of the cuticle, the hypodermis and the
body-wall muscles) and not by an increase of the inner pressure of the worm 33. The worms
typically lie on their side which means that a probe applied from above test both dorsal and
ventral muscles. Furthermore, the time resolution of the experiment was about 5 s, meaning
that fast fluctuations of muscle tone were averaged over. The method is thus useful for
determining time- and spatially averaged muscle tone. To test the method, we used drug
interference to either relax or persistently tense the body-wall muscles. To relax, worms were
treated with the GABA receptor agonist muscimol (20 mM), persistent muscle contraction
was induced by treatment with the acetylcholine receptor agonist tetramisole (5 mM). The
amount of hysteresis seen from the difference in approach and retraction curves (Fig. 3 B)
was small, indicating that the response to indentation is dominated by the elasticity of the
tissues. Reproducibility in a given location on the worm body was within 1-5% (Fig. 3 B).
Response varied at the very ends of the worms’ bodies and over the embryos. These locations

were therefore excluded. Variability along the body axis and between different worms was
within 30% and 40% respectively (Fig. 3 C).
The vit7 and wild type worms showed similar stiffness at physiological conditions in
control buffer (1.2 ± 0.28 N/m, N = 21 for vit7 vs 1.21± 0.43 N/m, N = 17 for wild type).
Upon treatment with muscimol, the stiffness of vit7 and wild type worms decreased by 24%
and 18% respectively (0.91 ± 0.19 N/m, N = 24 for vit7 vs 0.98 ± 0.36, N = 19 for wild type).
Treatment with tetramisole resulted in an increase in stiffness by 59 % for vit7 and 66% for
wild type (1.9 ± 0.45 N/m, N = 20 for vit7 vs 1.99 ± 0.4 N/m, N = 27 for wild type) (Fig. 3
D). The measured resistance to indentation of both dbn-1(vit7) and wild type worms was thus
clearly correlated with the level of muscle contraction. However, the average body-wallmuscle rigidity of vit7 mutants was not significantly different from that of wild type worms.
This result indicates that dbn-1(vit7) mutant is able to maintain proper muscle tone on
average.

Inhibition of Rho suppresses the vit7 mutant phenotype
Aiming at tracking down the molecular mechanism of hyper-bending of the vit7
mutant, we hypothesized that DBN-1 might be a novel regulator of the recently discovered
signaling cascade from Gq via RHO-1 to NCA ion channels that regulates neuronal
excitability and synaptic release 17. The motivation for this hypothesis was that it was found,
first, that C. elegans mutants with activated Gq pathway display coiled posture and a “loopy”
waveform of motion 34, 17. Mutations of players downstream of Gq, namely RhoGEF, NCA

channels and NCA channel accessory subunits (UNC-79, UNC-80 and NLF-1) have been
shown to suppress the effect of activated RHO-1 34, 17. Second, depletion of mammalian
drebrin-like protein mAbp1 or ectopic expression of its ADF-H domain increase Rho GTPase
signaling in human breast cancer cells 24. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the dbn1(vit7) mutation in C. elegans might over-activate RHO-1, leading to the observed hyperbending locomotion.
To test this hypothesis, we studied mutants in proteins downstream of Gq. C. elegans
carrying the ce362 mutation has a strongly suppressed RhoGEF function of UNC-73 and
cannot be activated by Gq 34. We constructed double mutants dbn-1(vit7); unc-73(ce362) and
found that ce362 decreased body curvature of the double mutant to the level of an unc73(ce362) single mutant. Moreover, the dbn-1(vit7); unc-73(ce362) double mutant appeared
sluggish, similar to the unc-73(ce362) single mutant (Fig. 4). This result shows that DBN-1 is
indeed involved in the regulation of the Gq - Rho signaling pathway opposing RHO-1.

(N = 50, P < 0.0001).

The locomotion defect of the vit7 mutant has a neuronal origin
DBN-1 is expressed in multiple tissues including neurons and body-wall muscles
(Supplementary Data 1). We therefore needed to identify the tissue in which DBN-1 functions
to control body bending. As C. elegans has a single gene encoding for Rho, we expressed a
dominant negative form of RHO-1 either in body-wall muscles or in neurons of the dbn1(vit7) mutant. RHO-1(T19N), expressed in body-wall muscles (driven by the him-4
promoter), did not affect the body curvature of the dbn-1(vit7) mutant, whereas its panneuronal expression (rab-3 promoter) resulted in the complete suppression of the hyperbending phenotype and in an additional suppression of movement velocity of the vit7 mutant
(Fig. 5). Based on these results, we conclude that DBN-1 controls C. elegans body bending
from neurons and that RHO-1 has an extended function in the control of movement velocity.
To narrow down which neurons are crucial for DBN-1-mediated body bending
control, we expressed RHO-1(T19N) in acetylcholine neurons (driven by the unc-17
promoter), GABA neurons (unc-25 promoter), mechano-sensory neurons (mec-3 promoter)
and interneurons including the DVA neuron (twk-16 promoter) of the vit7 mutant.
Remarkably, inactivation of RHO-1 in none of these classes of neurons alone resulted in the
suppression of the hyper-bending phenotype of vit7 mutant (Fig. 5). The mechanism
regulating body curvature is therefore not exclusively located in either acetylcholine, GABA,
mechano-sensory or interneurons.

Mutations in NCA-1 and NCA-2 suppress the vit7 mutant phenotype

Finally, we tested the hypothesis that DBN-1 is functionally engaged in the regulation of
NCA sodium leak channels. NCA-1 and NCA-2 function redundantly: while nca-1(gk9) and
nca-2(gk5) single mutants have wild-type-like sinusoidal wave locomotion, a double nca1(gk9); nca-2(gk5) mutant displays a “fainter” phenotype, characterized by short periods of
movement interrupted by periods of inactivity 35. Mutations that eliminate NCA channels
suppress the locomotion and body posture phenotypes of an activated Rho mutant 17.
Conversely, gain-of-function nca mutants with constitutively open channels show coiled
postures and move with strong bending 8, 36, 17.
Therefore, if the vit7 mutation indeed activates RHO-1 signaling within the Gq-NCA
pathway, the hyper-bending phenotype of the vit7 mutant should be suppressed by elimination
of NCA channels. We generated two double mutants dbn-1(vit7); nca-1(gk9) and dbn-1(vit7);
nca-2(gk5) as well as the triple mutant dbn-1(vit7); nca-1(gk9); nca-2(gk5) and analyzed their
locomotion phenotypes. Additional mutations in nca-1(gk9) and in nca-2(gk5) both
suppressed the hyper-bending phenotype of the dbn-1(vit7) mutant to the level of single nca1(gk9) and nca-2(gk5) mutants. Elimination of both NCA channels in the dbn-1 mutant
converted it to the “fainter” phenotype. The body curvature of the dbn-1(vit7); nca-1(gk9);
nca-2(gk5) triple mutant was indistinguishable from an nca-1(gk9); nca-2(gk5) double mutant
(Fig. 6). These results clearly demonstrate that the hyper-bending phenotype of dbn-1(vit7)
mutant is caused by the enhanced activity of both NCA-1 and NCA-2 channels.

Taken together, our data shows that DBN-1 is involved in neuronal control of C.
elegans locomotion, limiting the degree of body bending. At the molecular level, DBN-1
opposes RHO-1 and suppress the activity of both NCA-1 and NCA-2 cation leak channels.

Discussion
In this study, we generated a new dbn-1(vit7) mutant allele, which displays a hyperbending locomotion phenotype, but is able to maintain wild type muscle tone on average. We
tracked down the molecular mechanism of this phenotype and identified DBN-1 as an
essential regulator of NCA channel activity in neurons (Fig. 7).

and activates UNC-73/RhoGEF, which subsequently activates RHO-1 and NCA channel
function 17. DBN-1 functions antagonistically to RHO-1. DBN-1 targets NCA channels for
endocytosis.

C. elegans DBN-1 is a multi-domain protein that contains an N-terminal ADF-H
domain, three coiled-coils (3xCC), a proline-rich sequence and a C-terminal SH3 domain, of
which the 3xCC domain of DBN-1 was shown to bind F-actin in vitro 29. The ok925 mutation
that truncates DBN-1 after two coiled-coils leads to a mild disorganization of actin filaments

during body-wall muscle contraction 29 and affects vesicle scission during endocytosis in the
intestine 27. However, the remaining N-terminal part of DBN-1 in the ok925 mutant is
sufficient to support its wild-type-like locomotion (Fig. 2). In contrast, the truncation of DBN1 after the largest part of ADF-H domain in the vit7 mutant we present here dramatically
changed the C. elegans movement phenotype. This phenotype could be caused either by the
absence of the DBN-1 function or by the newly acquired function of the truncated DBN-1 that
is expressed at a low level. It would be interesting to know whether coiled-coil domains
provide functional redundancy for DBN-1 in actin binding. Whether or not this is the case, it
is evident that the 3xCC domain of DBN-1 plays an essential role in the molecular pathway
controlling the body bending mechanism.
Recently, Boateng and colleagues discovered that the mammalian drebrin-like protein
mAbp1 counteracts Rho GTP-ase in breast cancer cells 24. Our data clearly indicate that an
analogous mechanism is at work in C. elegans, because both the RhoGEF suppression and the
pan-neuronal expression of the dominant negative RHO-1 decreased the body curvature and
the movement velocity of the dbn-1(vit7) mutant. Interestingly, the expression of RHO1(T19N) in different classes of neurons (acetylcholine, GABA, mechano-sensory and
interneurons including the DVA neuron), as well in the body-wall muscles, did not affect the
locomotion behavior of dbn-1(vit7). Thus, DBN-1 acts in all neurons to regulate body
curvature. This is consistent with the finding that the inhibition of Rho in all neurons
suppresses the “loopy” waveform of the activated Gq mutant 17.
We here show that DBN-1 suppresses the activity of NCA sodium leak channels.
NCA-1 and NCA-2 are important players that control the neuronal excitability and synaptic
transmission at neuromuscular junctions 8, 9. The elimination of NCA channels results in
hyperpolarized resting membrane potential in premotor interneurons 10. The nca-1; nca-2
loss-of-function mutants expose a “fainter” phenotype, characterized by short periods of
movement interrupted by periods of inactivity 35. Conversely, gain-of-function nca mutants

with constitutively open channels show coiled postures and move with strong bending 8, 36, 17.
While the multiple signaling cascades controlling the NCA channels activity have been
identified, is not known how their spatial and temporal regulation is achieved. We speculate
that the NCA conductance is regulated by factors that determine the number of active
channels at the cell surface, in a similar way as described for other ion channels 37, 38, 39.
Based on the well-established roles of drebrin-like protein in endocytosis 25, 40 , 28, 26, 27, it
seems likely that interaction of DBN-1 with NCA channels directs their internalization. In
support of this hypothesis, mAbp1 knockout mice display a moderate reduction of both
receptor-mediated and synaptic endocytosis as well as severe impairment in synaptic vesicle
recycling 28, whereas elimination NCA channels ameliorates the recycling defect in
synaptojanin mutants, increasing the number of synaptic vesicles in both GABA and
acetylcholine neurons 41. In addition, mAbp1 has been discovered to be a key component of
the immunological synapses that regulates surface clustering of B-cell receptors 42. In
contrast, Rho is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis 43. Therefore, the activation of
NCA channels by RHO-1 17 might be a result of inhibition of their internalization.
In humans, mutations of NALCN channels are the direct causative factors of IHPRF
(infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies) and CLIFAHDD

(congenital contractures of the limbs and face with hypotonia and developmental delay)
syndromes. While the loss-of-function of NALCN leads to variable degree of hypotonia 44,
the most striking clinical abnormality of NALCN hyperactivity is a markedly delayed
relaxation of muscles following activation 36. We measured the muscle response of dbn1(vit7) mutants using atomic force microscopy. In spite of the fact that the animals have an
obvious defect in muscle regulation, we could not detect significant disturbance in their
average muscle tone. The reason for this might be that the dbn-1(vit7) mutant has a less severe
phenotype than the C. elegans bearing a orthologous patient's NALCN mutation, which leads
to curly posture, small body size, and reduced locomotion 36.

In summary, this study has revealed a surprising role of DBN-1 in the molecular
mechanisms that control the degree of body bending of C. elegans via suppression of NCA
sodium leak channels. We suggest that the level of dynamic activity of NCA channels that is
required for sustained locomotion is set by the balance between membrane insertion and
recycling. Because the structures of ion channels, receptors and their regulatory machineries
are remarkably conserved between C. elegans and humans 45, a similar mechanism might be
at work in the regulation of human NALCN conductance. The dbn-1(vit7) mutant therefore
appears to be a suitable model to study the molecular mechanisms and pathways underling
NALCN channel function.

Materials and methods
C. elegans strains
Wild type Bristol N2 and mutant strains: unc-73(ce362), nca-1(gk9), nca-2(gk5) and nca1(gk9); nca-2(gk5) were obtained from the C. elegans Genetic Center (University of
Minnesota). Worms were cultured at 20°C on nematode growth media (NGM) plates seeded
with E. coli OP50 46.

Generation of the dbn-1(vit7) mutant
The design of sgRNA was performed using CRISPRdirect software 47. To achieve successful
genome editing 30, a target-specific sequence 5'-GAGGTGCGAAAGCTCCCGG-3' was
chosen, containing a GG motif adjacent to the PAM sequence. The 19 base-sgRNA was
cloned into pDD162 using a Q5 mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs), as described by 48.
pDD162 (Peft-3::Cas9 + Empty sgRNA) 49 was purchased from Addgene (Plasmid #47549).

A repair oligo containing mutated PAM and new bases inserted between the sgRNA sequence
and PAM (5'-CATGCCAGATCGGAAATCGACATCGAGCCGGACGCGATTCGAAAA
GAGGTGCGAAAGCTCCCGGGCTAGCTCGTCGAACGCCAACGCCATCGTCGAATCC
ACGTACAGCATGCCGGAG-3') was synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich. A mixture of
Cas9/sgRNA1 for DBN-1 (50 ng/l), repair oligo (30 ng/l) and co-injection marker pRF4
(rol-6(su1006)) (120 ng/l) was injected into the gonads of C. elegans 50. Edits were
recovered from F2 plate containing rollers. To verify genome editing, genomic DNA
encoding DBN-1 was amplified by PCR, cloned into the pDonr201 vector (Invitrogen) and
sequenced by Seqlab. Although a repair oligo was designed to insert a stop codon, the genome
change resulted instead in a 16 base pairs deletion, which caused an open reading frame shift
and led to the appearance of a premature stop codon. Only a single vit7 allele was found. To
ensure the absence of mutations in other genes, the original mutant strain was back-crossed 5
times with wild type.

Molecular biology
Unc-25, unc-17, mec-3, twk-16 (containing a 491 bp sequence upstream of the start codon,
first exon and first intron 51) and him-4 promoter sequences were amplified from C. elegans
genomic DNA and each cloned to replace a rab-3 promoter in the rab-3p::GW (gift from
Stefan Eimer, University of Frankfurt). The rho-1 cDNA was amplified from C. elegans
cDNA (Invitrogen), sub-cloned into a pDonr201 vector (Invitrogen), mutated using the Q5
mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs) to obtain a T19N mutation and cloned into rab3p::GW, unc-25p::GW, unc-17p::GW, mec-3p::GW, twk-16p::GW and him-4p::GW
destination vectors. A cDNA encoding amino acids 1-132 of DBN-1 was amplified from dbn1 cDNA and cloned into pET28a and rab-3::GW vectors. All cDNA clones were confirmed
by DNA sequencing at Seqlab.

Transgene generation and crossings
Transgenic strains were generated by microinjection 50 of the plasmids dbn-1::GFP-dbn-1
(100 ng/l), rab-3::rho-1(T19N) (3 ng/l), him-4::rho-1(T19N) (50 ng/l), unc-17::rho1(T19N) (10 ng/l), unc-25::rho-1(T19N) (15 ng/l), mec-3::rho-1(T19N) (25 ng/l), twk16::rho-1(T19N) (30 ng/l) into dbn-1(vit7) and rab-3p::ADF-H (10 ng/l) into wild type
gonads. pRFP-odr-1 (100 ng/l) was used as co-injection marker. Three to five transgenic
lines were isolated for each injected plasmid mix and it was confirmed that each set of lines
had the same phenotype. Crossings of unc-73(ce362), nca-1(gk9), nca-2(gk5) and nca-1(gk9);
nca-2(gk5) to dbn-1(vit7) were performed using classical genetic approaches. Mutations in the
double and triple mutants were confirmed by PCR or sequencing.

Antibodies against the ADF-H domain of DBN-1
Recombinant His-tagged DBN-1(1-132) was expressed in E. coli BL21-Gold cells and
purified on Ni-NTA Agarose (Macherey-Nagel). Two guinea pigs were immunized at
Bioscience with His-DBN-1(1-132) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The final antisera
were purified separately using His-DBN-1(1-132) bound to NHS-activated Sepharose High
Performance (GE Healthcare Life Science). Both purified antibodies were tested in western
blot. They similarly recognized the ADF-H domain of DBN-1 in the lysate of Ex[rab3p::ADF-H] worms, DBN-1 in the lysates of wild type and dbn-1(ok925) worms, and the
significantly reduced level of DBN-1 in the lysate of wild type worms fed with RNAi against
DBN-1. The reason for the generation of these antibodies was that the antibodies against fulllength DBN-1 described in 29 do not recognize the ADF-H domain of DBN-1.

Protein electrophoresis and western blots
Hundred young adult worms were collected in 1.5 ml tubes in 25 l of lysis buffer, containing
150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH7.4, 2mM EDTA and 1% Nonidet P-40. The samples were
then subjected to alternating procedures of freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by heating at
24° to break the worms. After this, samples were homogenized by pipetting 100 times up and
down using a 10 l pipette tip. 25 l of 2x Laemmli buffer was added and the sample was
heated to 95°C for 5 min. 15 l of sample were resolved by a 12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel
(Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Millipore) using a Bio-Rad Criterion Blotter. After the transfer, the membrane
was blocked with 10% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min and
incubated with affinity-purified guinea pig anti-ADF-H domain-DBN-1 antibodies diluted at
1:500 at 4°C overnight, followed by treatment with diluted at 1:10000 peroxidase-labeled
goat anti-guinea pig IgG (sc-2438). The reactivity was detected with an Amersham ECL
Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Science) using an Intas gel imager (Intas Science
Imaging Instruments GmbH). The membrane was treated with a buffer containing 2% SDS,
100 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 50°C for 30 min to remove
bound probes, and re-probed with mouse monoclonal anti--tubulin antibody diluted at
1:1000 (T6199, Sigma-Aldrich) in combination with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG
diluted at 1:10000 (A6154, Sigma-Aldrich).

Behavioral Assays.
Groups of C. elegans, each containing 10 worms, were assayed at the same environmental
parameters. An individual worm was placed onto new NGM plate with a thin layer of E. coli
OP50. Immediately after the worm adapted to the new environment and started to move

forward, its movement was recorded using a Leica MZFLIII microscope equipped with a
SPOT Insight camera. Videos (each containing 20 frames, taken with a rate of 1 frame per
second) were analyzed using ImageJ 52. The worms’ velocity was measured as the number of
body bends in 20 seconds and as body length per second.

Numerical calculation of mean squared curvature
To calculate mean squared curvature, we followed established procedures 53. A midline 32 was
drawn along the entire length of the worm body and analyzed by a custom-written computer
program. For each worm, five consecutive positions in an interval of 1 s were analyzed. To
estimate the mean squared curvature of the worms, we interpolated hand-drawn worm shapes
using a basis spline of degree 6 and an interpolation factor of n = 100. Only the central
constant-diameter section of the body of the worms was considered. Thin body tips were not
taken into account since the curvature tended to vary and get stronger at the tips.
The curvature κ at any point along a (one dimensional) curve in two dimensions is defined as
the rate of change in tangent direction θ of the contour, as a function of arc length s:
d
d
The bending energy of a homogeneous elastic rod with a bending modulus K is:

2
In our case the material properties of the worm are not well known, and it is probably not
exactly a homogeneous rod. Nevertheless, we can approximately measure the overall degree
of bending B by calculating the integral of the squared curvature along the length of the
worm’s body:

Since worms differed in overall length, we normalized this number with the worm’s contour
length L, giving us mean squared curvature MSC in units of [1/µm2]:

Numerical procedure: The tangent angle (s) at equidistant points along the worm contour
(excluding ends) was calculated. The curvature k(s) was determined as the numerical
derivative of (s) with respect to s. The worm contour was subdivided into N segments with
tangent vector

Body stiffness measurements
Force-indentation curves of living nematodes were captured using an atomic force microscope
(MFP-3D, Asylum). Measurements were performed in single wild type and dbn-1(vit7)
young adult worms either in their physiological state or chemically treated to induce muscle
relaxation or muscle contraction. Samples were prepared by placing worms into either M9
buffer or M9 buffer containing 20 mM muscimol (incubation time ~30-60 min) or 5 mM
tetramisole (incubation time ~ 10-15 min). The worm were then transferred from the

respective buffers onto agarose pads (0.5 mm thickness; 10 % agarose in water) and their
head and tail were immobilized by placing a small drop of instant glue on top (Loctite,
Germany, 401). Worms were then covered with the respective buffers. Indentation tests were
performed along the worms’ free midsection (far from glued ends) using a bead of radius 7
µm attached to the tip of a rectangular cantilever (Nano and more TL-NLC-50, nominal
stiffness 48N/m). To reduce the effect of geometry-induced variabilities in the measured
stiﬀness, the bead was positioned over the center of the nematode. The maximum applied
forces (2-3.5 µN) were set to reach maximum indentation depths in the range of 2-4.5 µm.
This is suﬃcient to indent deeper than the thickness of the cuticle plus the hypodermis (~0.4
µm). The piezo approach velocity during the indentation was set to 10 µm/s. The stiffness of
each worm was obtained by performing ten measurements in quick succession on single
points. This procedure was repeated on 5 -10 different points along the body mid axis for each
worm. In total, 5 worms were analyzed for each condition. A linear fit to log-log plots of the
data not regarding indentations less than 0.5 µm gave an average exponent of n = 1.04± 0.06,
confirming a linear force-indentation relation. The spring constant of the worm at each
measured spot was obtained from a linear fit of the approach part of the force-indentation
curves in the range of 0.5-1.5 µm of indentation. The spring constant at each point is the
average value of the ten measurements on that point, with the error given by twice the
standard deviation from the average.

Statistical analysis.
All statistical tests and computations were carried out using Python (https://www.python.org/)
and OriginPro 8.5G (https://www.originlab.com/) software. Values obtained from the worms’
behavioral assays are shown as box-and-whisker plots, where the upper and lower limits of
the box correspond to the 75th and 25th percentile values, the central bar indicates the median

and the whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum values. Values of the worms’ body
stiffness measured by AFM are reported as the mean ± standard deviation. The data were
tested for a normal distribution. The group data were compared using a two-tailed Student’s ttest.
