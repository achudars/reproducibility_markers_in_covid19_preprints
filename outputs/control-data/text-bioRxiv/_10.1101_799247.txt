Abstract
Translocation of many secretory proteins through the bacterial plasma membrane is facilitated by
a complex of the protein translocase SecYEG with the motor protein SecA. The ATP-free complex
is unstable in detergent, raising the question how SecA may perform several rounds of ATP
hydrolysis without being released. Here we show that dual recognition of (i) SecYEG and (ii) acidic
lipids in its immediate vicinity confers an apparent nanomolar affinity. As a result the complex
between SecA and reconstituted SecYEG may be stable for tens of seconds as visualized by highspeed atomic force microscopy. These long lasting events and complementary shorter ones both
give rise to single ion channel openings of equal duration. The existence of two different
conformations of the complex was confirmed by luminescence resonance energy transfer. The deep
protrusion of SecA’s two-helix finger into the aqueous channel is in line with the power stroke
mechanism of translocation.

Introduction
An important step in the biogenesis of many secretory proteins is their translocation across the lipid
bilayer. The conserved Sec protein translocation machinery facilitates most of these translocation
events. In bacteria it contains two key elements, the hetero-trimeric transmembrane channel
SecYEG and the soluble motor protein SecA. While SecYEG provides the pathway for protein
translocation, SecA affords part of the translocation energy by hydrolyzing ATP, the other part
being provided by the proton motif force (1). SecA gains access to the SecYEG complex via a lipidbound intermediate state (2). Its highly amphipathic N-terminal helix carries positively charged
amino acids aligned on one side, and hydrophobic amino acids on the other which interact with
negatively charged phospholipids (3). The N-terminus thereby penetrates into the membrane and
aligns parallel to the membrane-plane at a depth of 7-8 Å (4). Deletion of the first 20 amino acids
of the N-terminus (SecA His-N20) inactivates SecA. Activity can be restored by substituting the
N-terminus for a His-tag and supplementing SecYEG proteoliposomes with Ni+ -NTA lipids,
suggesting that membrane tethering is important for functioning (5). However, the crystal structure
of the SecA-SecYEG complex (6) indicates that the helical part of the amphipathic SecA Nterminus is not in contact with the membrane. Thus, a major conformational change of SecA was
suggested to allow SecYEG binding and penetration of the N-terminus at the same time (2, 4). Yet,
structural evidence for SecA’s large conformational change is lacking.

The above-mentioned experimental observations have been made with SecA bound to
nucleotides. The affinity of the nucleotide-free conformation to the lipid membrane is not known.
It has only been reported that nucleotide release weakens the interaction between SecA and
SecYEG (7). In consequence, the SecA SecYEG complex appears to be unstable in detergent (6).
It is thus unclear how SecA may perform several hydrolysis cycles (5) without being released from
SecYEG.

Using a set of complementary biophysical techniques, we were able to reconstruct the
detailed molecular pathway of SecA targeting SecYEG embedded in a lipid membrane. We built a
coherent mechanistic model based on kinetic rate constants and structural information obtained
from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, high-speed atomic force microscopy (HSAFM) (8–11), luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) (12, 13), and single channel
electrophysiological recordings (14–17).

We first studied and quantified the N-terminus mediated interaction of SecA with a lipid membrane
in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. We used the C-terminally truncated SecA mutant
N95 (18) that has been used to obtain the structure of the SecA-SecYEG complex (6). Small
unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) made of E.coli lipids where applied to the SPR sensor chip to generate
a supported lipid bilayer (SLB). To check for defects in the resulting SLB that potentially cause
unspecific adhesion of SecA to the bare dextran surface of the SPR sensor chip we always applied
500 nM of the SecA His-N20 mutant (5) prior to the actual experiment and made sure that no
binding was observed. We then injected SecA into the SPR flow cell at increasing concentrations
(50 – 1000 nM) leading to SecA association, alternated by the injection of pure buffer to induce
dissociation, and repeated the experiment at three different KCl concentrations (10, 50, 200 mM)
in the running buffer (Fig. 1A-C). A model describing a two state interaction of SecA with the lipid
membrane best described the resulting SPR sensorgrams: [SecA] [lipids]  [SecA lipid]1  [SecA
lipid]2 (Fig. 1D). The overall SecA abundance on the membrane was comparable at different [KCl],
as indicated by the size of SPR signal (Fig. S1). Yet, both the kinetic rates determined and the

relative abundance of SecA in states 1 and 2 that we obtained by fitting the mathematical model to
the data strongly varied. At highest KCl concentrations (200 mM; Fig. 1A), the relative abundance
in states 1 and 2 was roughly the same. At 50 mM KCl (Fig. 1B), the abundance in state 1 was ~
half of the abundance in state 2, and at the lowest KCl concentration (10 mM; Fig. 1C) and the
highest SecA concentration (1 µM) the abundance in state 1 was only 1/4 of the corresponding
abundance in state 2. Apparently, the decreasing salt concentrations shifted the equilibrium towards
state 2. We further noticed that at 10 mM KCl, SecA His-N20 binding to the lipid membrane was
no longer negligible (Fig. S2), indicating that the sensorgrams contained additional, N-terminus
independent contributions. These unaccounted interactions may explain deviations of the
mathematical fit from the sensorgram (Fig. 1C).

The kinetic rates obtained from the global fits showed an unique trend (Fig. 1D): The initial
membrane association rate ka,1 was smallest (0.8 ± 0.1 x 104 M-1s-1) at the highest salt concentration
and increased monotonically with decreasing KCl concentrations (50 mM KCl: 1.7 ± 0.1 x 104 M1 -1
s ; 10 mM KCl: 2.5 ± 0.1 x 104 M-1s-1), indicating that SecA targeting to the membrane (state 1)
is driven by electrostatics.

We then performed high speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) experiments to monitor the
next step in the molecular pathway, i.e. the encounter and binding of lipid bound SecA to SecYEG
embedded in a lipid membrane. We employed periodically suspended membranes (PSMs), which
are flat lipid membranes made of E. coli liposomes supported by a two-dimensional streptavidin
crystal that allows for tuning the lateral mobility of embedded membrane proteins while largely
suppressing unwanted interactions with the support (19). They are particularly suited for HS-AFM
investigations, because the valleys between streptavidin hills may accommodate SecYEG’s
periplasmic loops. Being unable to freely migrate between the valleys, SecYEG can easily be
imaged by HS-AFM. After inspection of the PSMs and identification of individual SecYEG
molecules, which typically protrude up to 2 nm from the membrane, SecA was injected into the
HS-AFM liquid cell. After an initial lack time, fast diffusing membrane bound SecA molecules
(‘spike like noise’) (19) and binding events of individual SecA molecules to properly oriented
SecYEG complexes (i.e. with their cytoplasmic side facing upwards) were observed (Fig. 2A,
movie S1).

The SecYEG-SecA complex exhibited a height of up to 5 nm with respect to the surrounding
bilayer. Remarkably, individual SecA molecules were not stationary bound to the underlying
SecYEG but exhibited a discrete on- and off-hopping. Fig. 2B exemplifies this dynamic interaction
in form of height vs. time traces that were generated from movie S1. The movie shows the height
fluctuation at the position of a SecYEG channel due to the presence/absence of a SecA molecule
on top. The traces also highlight that SecA binding was not randomly distributed among the
SecYEG channels in the field of view. Rather, the fluctuations localized to the very same SecYEG
complex that initially had bound a SecA molecule. This behavior was observed in the beginning of
the experiments where the membrane bound SecA concentration was low. A statistical analysis of
the time periods in which SecA was bound (Fig. 2C) or unbound (Fig. 2D) yielded characteristic
time constants off=1.1 ± 0.3 s and on=1.7 ± 0.4 s, respectively.

At higher surface concentrations of SecA (Fig. 2E, movie S2) the SecYEG-SecA complex
was stationary, i.e. the initial on- and off-hoping was not observed anymore, which is also evident
from the corresponding height vs. time traces (Fig. 2F). Taken together, the HS-AFM experiments
suggest three different states of SecA associated with SecYEG: (I) A state where SecA is localized
in the vicinity of SecYEG but not directly bound to it (effective lifetime on after initial encounter,
may be associated with a lipid-annulus surrounding SecYEG (20)) likely being too loosely attached

to be imaged via HS-AFM, (II) a low affinity state where SecA is loosely bound to SecYEG
(lifetime off), and (III) a high affinity state where SecA forms a stable complex with SecYEG (Fig.
2E, F). Notably, the HS-AFM movies did not provide evidence for distinct structural differences
between states II and III, as the differences in height or lateral dimensions of the respective SecASecYEG complexes where not resolvable (Fig. 2A vs. E).

To further characterize and structurally distinguish the low and high-affinity SecYEG-bound states
observed in HS-AFM experiments, we performed luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET)
experiments between a fluorescent dye (ATTO488) on SecA’s two helix finger (K797; acceptor)
and a terbium ion (donor) in a genetically engineered lanthanide binding pocket (LBT)(12, 21)
inserted at position G297 within helix-connecting loops at the periplasmic face of SecYEG,
respectively (Fig. 3). The positions on SecA and SecYEG were chosen to accurately measure the
insertion depth of the two-helix finger into the SecYEG channel when SecA is engaged with the
translocon.

In detergent, SecY G297LBT showed only a very weak, salt-independent interaction with
SecA K797C ATTO488, as evident from the small changes in total emission and acceptor emission
decay curves upon SecA addition (Fig. S3A and B). The occupancy of SecYEG molecules by
nucleotide-free SecA amounted to about 10 %. This is in agreement with the reported requirement
of ATP to form stable complexes (6). The relaxation of donor fluorescence intensity was best
described by a model taking into account a single acceptor lifetime. The latter corresponded to a
distance of 28.5 ± 0.1 Å between the G297LBT and the tip of the two helix finger. This distance is
much shorter than that displayed in the crystal structure of the SecYEG - SecA complex, i.e. it
indicates a deep penetration of the two helix finger into the translocation channel. This observation
suggests that nucleotide release (or hydrolysis) may trigger the movement of the two-helix finger
into the SecY pore. Such movement would be compatible with the previously published power
stroke mechanism, i.e. with the two-helix finger pushing the polypeptide chain (5, 6).

Reconstitution of SecYEG G297LBT into proteoliposomes resulted in a much more robust
binding of labeled SecA. The decay time of fluorescence intensity depended on both the SecA and
KCl concentrations (Fig. 4A and B, 100 and 10 mM KCl, respectively; total emitted fluorescence,
upper panel; acceptor fluorescence, lower panel). In contrast to the measurements performed in
detergent, these data were globally best fit by a model taking into account two distinct acceptor
fluorescence lifetimes (cf. materials and methods). Consequently, the distances between the
G297LBT and the tip of the two-helix finger calculated from these lifetimes, 27.3 ± 2.1 Å and
42.0 ± 6.5 Å represent two distinct structural states of the complex, differing in the degree of
penetration of SecA’s two-helix finger into the translocation channel (Fig. 4C). Apparently, the
smaller distance matches the distance and thus the conformation determined in detergent, but the
larger distance only appears in the presence of a lipid bilayer or when nucleotides are bound (6).

SecYEG occupancy increased monotonically with increasing SecA concentration. This
change was accompanied by an increase in the SecA fraction that elicited the fast relaxation of
fluorescence due to the deep penetration of the two-helix finger. At maximum SecA concentrations,
the sizes of both slow and fast relaxing fractions were almost equal to each other (Fig. 4D).
Replication of these experiments with the LBT located at an alternative position within SecY (E62
on the so-called ‘plug’), essentially confirmed the existence of two SecY-insertion distinct states of
the two-helix finger in the SecA-SecYEG complex (Fig. S4).

173
174

SecA-SecYEG interaction was salt dependent. At low KCl concentrations, the fraction with
a deep penetration of the two-helix finger was small (~ 20%). It monotonically increased with

increasing KCl concentrations (Fig. S4C-F recorded at saturating SecA concentrations; Fig. 4D,
100 mM vs. 10 mM at different SecA concentrations). That is, the fraction of donor molecules that
exhibit a fast relaxation to the ground state increased with KCl concentration. It became equal to
the fraction of donors with slow relaxation times at 100 mM KCl. We conclude that the reduction
of the effective membrane surface potential at higher ionic strength shifts the equilibrium towards
the SecA conformation of with a deeply inserted two-helix finger.

To check whether the distinct SecYEG bound states of SecA renders the translocon leaky for ions,
we performed single channel electrophysiology experiments. We added SecYEG-proteoliposomes
to the hypotonic solution at one side of a pre-formed planar lipid bilayer. A transmembrane osmotic
gradient (500/100 mM KCl in cis/trans compartments) served to fuse vesicles with open SecYEG
complexes to the bilayer (15). In the presence of SecA we observed two types of channel activity
(Fig. 5A): long living (12 ± 7 s) (Fig. 5B), fully opened SecYEG complexes and short living
channels (1.8 ± 1 s) (Fig. 5C) with a much smaller unitary conductance of only G = 40 ± 5 pS. The
latter events appeared to be compatible with the channels that were captured by the crystal structure
of the SecYEG complex with SecA, i.e. with channels that are only primed to receive the
polypeptide chain but have not yet fully opened (6). In contrast, the events with the larger
conductivity G of 600±80 pS were similar in size to the ion channels observed after plug deletion
(14) or ribosome binding (16).

The nucleotide-free SecA interacts with both the SecYEG complex and lipid membranes. When
taken separately, binding to both partners is weak. Yet, when acting in unison, the lifetime τ of the
SecA - SecYEG complex may reach tens of seconds. Assuming a diffusion limited on-rate kon, the
observation suggests an apparent equilibrium binding constant Kapp of the nucleotide-free SecA to
the reconstituted SecYEG complex in the nanomolar range:

Binding to membranes containing acidic phospholipids emerges as a dynamic two-state
process. It involves the transition between an initially formed complex (Fig. 6, State 1) to a more
tightly bound complex (State 2) as demonstrated by SPR experiments. The kinetic on-rate (ka,1) of
this interaction decreases with increasing salt concentrations suggesting that the initial driving force
of SecA membrane targeting and therefore its interaction with the membrane in state 1 is of
electrostatic nature (3). The transition between state I and II may be associated with the insertion
of the N-terminus into the lipid membrane as previously suggested (4).

HS-AFM observations of SecA binding to membrane embedded SecYEG indicate the
existence of high and low affinity SecA-SecYEG complexes. The high affinity complex (State III)
did not dissociate within the time frame of the experiments, suggesting lifetimes (d,5, d,6) of tens
of seconds or even minutes. In contrast, the low affinity complex (State IV) frequently dissociated
(d,4). It ended up in a defined state (State V) close to the SecYEG channel. Re-association events
(a,4) occurred (Fig. 2A and B). One may speculate that in state V SecA is associated with the acidic
phospholipid annulus surrounding SecYEG by inserting its N-terminus into the membrane.
Interestingly, the hopping between states IV and V did neither lead to a transition into state III

(stable binding) nor into the formation of a sole lipid bound state (such as state II). Accordingly,
only lower limits for the lifetime in state IV (a,6, d,3) were derived from the respective observation
times.

LRET experiments showed the existence of one (in detergent; in the absence of a lipid
bilayer) or two (when SecYEG is reconstituted into a lipid bilayer) structurally distinct SecASecYEG complexes (Fig. 6; States III and IV). Importantly, the penetration depths of SecA’s twohelix finger into the detergent-solved SecYEG and into one of the membrane-embedded SecYEG
complexes (State III) were identical. The second state however was not observed in detergent,
further supporting the idea that State IV is strongly associated with the surrounding lipid annulus
and a potential insertion of SecA’s N-terminus therein.

232

Single ion channel recordings also supported the existence of two states: two classes of
channels with distinct unitary ion conductivities were observed. Their open times were roughly
similar to the lifetimes of the SecA – SecYEG complexes as observed in HS-AFM experiments,
thereby assigning the observed conductivity states to the respective structural states. It is important
to note that the observation of these channels is only possible in partly de-energized membranes.
That is, physiological values of the membrane potential serve to close the ion channels (15), thereby
restoring the membrane barrier to ions and small molecules (22).

238
239
240
241
242

Our model suggests that the insertion of SecA’s N-terminus into the lipid membrane hinders
a deep penetration of SecA’s two-helix finger into SecYEG. Thus, SecA is trapped shuttling in
between state IV and V. However, it does not require a major conformational change (2, 4) to
strongly bind to SecYEG as in state III the N-terminus is functioning solely as membrane-tether
(5) that is electrostatically linked to the membrane, but not inserted into it.

243
244
245

The strong binding must be the result of (i) hydrophobic interactions between the two helix
finger with the SecYEG channel (equilibrium dissociation constant KSecYEG) and (ii) electrostatic
interactions between the N-terminus and the membrane (as in lipid bound state I; Equilibrium

affinity in the absence of lipids and ATP is thus 8 times lower than the binding affinity of detergentsolubilized SecYEG in the presence of ATP (3.9 µM) (24), which is likely the reason why the
crystallization of the ATP-free SecA-SecYEG complex was not achieved (6).
Summarizing, we find that the interaction between the membrane embedded translocation channel
SecYEG and the nucleotide-free SecA makes use of a unifying principle known from many other
high-affinity interactions: the amplification of binding affinity by dual attraction of two interaction
sites on a single ligand to two neighboring sites of the binding partner. As a result, the SecYEG SecA complex is stable enough to survive the interval between ADP release and ATP binding,
enabling SecA to perform multiple cycles of hydrolysis while bound to SecYEG.

SecA was obtained from overexpressing E.coli cells as previously described (15). To position an
acceptor dye on the tip of SecA’s two-helix finger, we introduced a cysteine at position K797 by
site directed mutagenesis into the expression vector pET30b SecA(N95). This mutant was
previously shown to have minimal influence on the translocation activity of SecA (25–27). After
induction at an O.D. 600 of 0.9 with 1mM Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG, Peqlab,
VWR) SecA(N95) K797C was overexpressed for 4 hours at 37 °C in E.coli NiCo21 cells (New
England Biolabs) grown in 2xYT (Acumedia) containing Kanamycin. Cells were pelleted and lysed
using an Avestin Emulsiflex C5 in Lysis Buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 25 mM
Imidazole, supplemented with Protease inhibitors) with 2 cycles of 20,000 psi. After 1 hour of
centrifugation at 100,000xg at 4 °C the supernatant was incubated with Chitin resin (New England
Biolabs) for 30 minutes at 4 °C to remove metalloproteases. SecA(N95) K797C was affinity
purified by incubating the flow-through with Ni2+-chelating beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Columns were
washed with Wash Buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0,5 M NaCl) containing 25 mM imidazole.
Beads were washed with Wash Buffer before incubation with 0,6 mM TCEP for 10 minutes.
Labeling was performed using Atto488-maleimide (Atto-Tec) for 45 minutes. Following another

HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 200 mM Imidazole) and concentrated to 500µl. Finally, we performed
size exclusion chromatography on an ÄKTA pure system (GE Healthcare) using 20 mM HEPES

SecYEG was purified and labeled as previously described (16). In short, SecYEG was obtained
from E.coli CBL21 (New England Biolabs) transformed with the arabinose dependent pBAD vector
encoding cysteinless SecE, SecY, and SecG genes with an LBT tag either at G297 or at E62 of
SecY. The G297 position is located in a loop of the periplasmic end of transmembrane helix 7.
Since it is part of the lateral gate, it is likely to change position upon channel opening. The same
holds true for E62 due to its location on SecY’s plug.

Transformed E.coli cells were grown in 2xYT medium (Acumedia) containing Ampicillin to an
O.D. 600 of 0,7 at 37 °C when overexpression was induced by the addition of 2g/l arabinose. After
additional incubation for 5 hours at 37 °C cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended
in Lysis Buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease
inhibitors (Thermo Scientific Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and 0,5 mM AEBSF). After lysis
with 2 cycles of 20,000 psi using an Avestin Emulsiflex C5 membrane fractions were separated by
centrifugation at 100,000xg for 1 hour at 4° C and membrane pellets were solubilized in Lysis
buffer containing 1% DDM (n-Dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside, Anatrace). Following incubation for
1 hour at 4° C solutions were centrifuged at 100,000xg for 30 minutes at 4° C. Supernatants were
incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Ni-NTA Superflow, Qiagen) for 1 hour at 4° C and washed with
Wash Buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0,6 mM DDM, 20 mM imidazole).
Proteins were eluted using 10ml of Wash Buffer containing 200 mM imidazole. The eluate was
concentrated to 500µl and size exclusion chromatography was performed on an ÄKTA pure system
(GE Healthcare) equilibrated with SecYEG FPLC Buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol, 0,6 mM DDM). Protein concentrations were assessed using Bradford assays.

for 30 minutes, over-expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG. After 2 hours cells
were harvested. Cell lysis was performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% v/v glycerol, 300 mM
KCl supplemented with protease inhibitors by 2 rounds at 20,000 psi in a homogenizer Emulsiflex
C5 (Avestin). Insoluble material was harvested by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C and 100,000xg, for
25 minutes. After resuspension in Solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 6 M Urea) and
stirring of the sample at 4 °C for 1 hour solubilized fractions were obtained by another
ultracentrifugation step at 4 °C and 100,000xg for 90 minutes. Supernatant was incubated with Ni2+chelating beads (Ni-NTA superflow, Qiagen) for 1 hour. After washing (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
6 M urea, 10 mM imidazole) proOmpA was eluted with Elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 6

SecYEG complexes were reconstituted into lipid vesicles and planar bilayers as previously
described (14). In brief, to 20 mg/ml of E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster,
AL) we sequentially added 50 mM K-HEPES pH 7.5, 6% deoxy Big-CHAP (Affymetrix Anatrace,
Maumee, OH, USA) and SecYEG in detergent (Protein to Lipid ratio of 1:50) at room temperature.
For LRET experiments a DOPE:DOPG (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) mixture (mass ratio
7:3) was used instead of E.coli polar lipid extract due to unfavorable unspecific binding of Tb3+ to
this lipid extract. Subsequent to detergent removal by Bio-beads SM2 (Bio Rad), the
proteoliposomes were harvested by ultracentrifugation (80 min at 100,000 x g) and resuspended at
a lipid concentration of 5–10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 10% glycerol
and protease inhibitor.

Translocation Assay

337

To show channel functionality we tested reconstituted SecYEG mutants for their translocation
capability as previously described(28, 29). In the presence of both ATP and SecA proOmpA-DHFR
is translocated into proteo-LUVs and is therefore not accessible to a subsequent proteinase K digest.

Single channel measurements were performed as previously described (15, 16). Ag/AgCl reference
electrodes in the cis and trans compartments were to the command signal of the patch clamp
amplifier (model EPC9, HEKA electronics, Germany) and the ground, respectively. The recording
filter for the transmembrane current was a 4 pole Bessel with -3 dB corner frequency of 0.1 kHz.
The raw data were analyzed using the TAC software package (Bruxton Corporation, Seattle, WA).
Gaussian filters of 12 Hz or 112 Hz were applied to reduce noise.

To perform electrophysiological measurements we fused proteoliposomes to preformed planar
bilayer lipid membranes. These “solvent-free” planar bilayers were folded by raising the level of
two adjacent aqueous solutions over the dividing aperture in a Teflon septum with E. coli polar
lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) monolayers on top (30). Fusion was facilitated
by a 500 mM : 100 mM KCl gradient across the planar membrane. The hyperosmotic compartment
contained the proteoliposomes and SecA. Both compartments were buffered by 25 mM K-HEPES
at pH 7.5. In addition to the wild type translocon, we also subjected the mutants with LBT tag and
fluorescent dye to our electrophysiological experiments. The result was invariant.

Tb3+ acted as LRET donor in our experiments. It was embedded in a high affinity (Kd = 57±3 nM)
lanthanide binding tag that consisted of the following 17 amino acids: YIDTNNDGWYEGDELLA
(21). Its tryptophan served as antenna for efficient Tb3+excitation at 266 nm by a Nd:YAG-laser
system (VM-TIM, Jena, Germany). We used a home-built LRET setup as described (31). Briefly,
the laser light passed a dichroitic mirror (z266rdc, Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT, USA) and was
focused on the sample via a 40 x 1.25 glycerol immersion quartz objective (Sysmex Partec GmbH,
Münster, Germany). The objective also served to collect the light emitted by terbium or the acceptor
molecules, Atto488 or Atto532. These fluorescent dyes were attached via maleimide linkers to
genetically introduced cysteines in SecY or SecA. Both terbium luminescence and the fluorescent
light further went through the dichroic mirror to a longpass filter (HQ465lp, Chroma, Bellows Falls,
VT, USA), which removed residual excitation light. Close proximity between the terbium ion and
the fluorescent dye resulted in a decrease of luminescence lifetime. Alternatively to donor
luminescence, we measured acceptor fluorescence (sensitized emission). For that purpose, a
bandpass filter (D520/25m or HQ567/15x, Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT, USA) was additionally
inserted into the emission beampath. In both measurement modes the light was absorbed by a gated
single photon avalanche diode (SPCM-AQRH, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA), connected to
a DSN-101 power supply (PicoQuant, Berlin, Gremany). The signal was recorded and triggered by
a multichannel scaler card (NanoHarp 250, PicoQuant, Berlin, Gremany). A delay of 30 μs between
the onset of the light pulse (5-6 ns pulse duration) and diode activation helped to avoid any
interference of the measurement with direct acceptor excitation.

376
377
378
379

As a system check we used parts of the two-helix-finger, the C-terminal α-helix of SecA, as a
molecular ruler. We measured a distance of 47 Å for the unbound SecA K797C-Atto488 V829LBT
double mutant, which perfectly agrees with estimates from crystal structures (2fsi – 47.5 Å, 2fsh –
47.1 Å, 2ipc – 49.7 Å).

Evaluation of luminescence decay curves

381
382

Even though several publications (13, 32–34) point out how LRET decay curves may be evaluated
it is worth to lay out the basis for the global fit routine employed in our evaluation.

A given number of donors 𝐷0 is excited by a nanoseconds laser pulse, which appears on the
timescale of the observed decay as instantaneous. Each donor either can decay directly or may – if
present- transfer its energy to an acceptor. This occurs with a time constant 𝜏 𝑇 . Since the acceptors
emit within nanoseconds, this process is considered as instantaneous as well. The population of
donors may be split in several fractions where no energy transfer occurs (fraction 𝑎𝐷 = 𝐷𝐷 ⁄𝐷0 ) or
where transfer occurs with distinct time constants 𝜏 𝑇,𝑖 (fractions 𝑎𝑖 = 𝐷𝑖 ⁄𝐷0 ). For the donors 𝐷𝐷 ,
the decay is simply described by

Since the detected counts (𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑡 (𝑡)) are proportional (proportionality factor 𝛼) to the number
of emitted photons per time, equations 3 and 4 yield (𝐵𝐺 is the detector background):
5

𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑡 (𝑡) = 𝐵𝐺 + 𝛼 ∙ 𝐷𝐷 (𝑡) ∙ 𝜏𝐷−1

If LRET occurs, the following differential equation describes the two pathways that are possible
(direct decay or energy transfer):

If sensitized emission is detected (by inserting a bandpass filter into the emission beam path), only
the donors decaying into the LRET pathway are detected (the proportionality factor 𝛼 ′ and 𝐵𝐺’ in
this detection mode can differ from 𝛼 and 𝐵𝐺 since the detection efficiency of the detector may be
wavelength dependent or the altered acquisition settings are required for sensitized emission
compared to total emission):

We describe a system, where some donors have no acceptor present, some have one that sits close
(short transfer time 𝜏 𝑇,𝑖 ), some have one that sits further away (long transfer time 𝜏 𝑇,𝑖 ). Hence the
sensitized emission becomes:

Recorded decay curves were fit with the NonlinearModelFit-Routine of Mathematica 11.2
(Wolfram Research, Champaign, USA). A weight of 1/y was applied in the routine. A
titration experiment consisting of pairs of total emission and sensitized emission curves is
globally fit in the following way:

417
418
419
420
421



All traces share the same lifetimes of the donor (𝜏𝐷 ) and transfer lifetimes 𝜏 𝑇,𝑖

422



All traces share the same proportionality factors 𝛽′ and 𝛽



Each pair of total emission (fit with equation 11) and sensitized emission (fit with equation
10) share the same 𝑎𝑖′ and 𝑎𝐷′ . 𝐵𝐺 and 𝐵𝐺′ are local parameters.



If no acceptor is present in the system (e.g. 0 µM SecA in Fig. 4a and b), the parameters 𝑎𝑖′
are set to 0 for this pair of traces.

Distances 𝑟𝑖 between donor and acceptor are calculated via (𝑅0 is the Foerster radius of the

The distance between the Cα atoms of SecYEG G297LBT with SecA K797C is equal to
approximately 46 Å for the PDB entries 5GAE, 5CH4, 5AWW, 5EUL, 3J46. Opening of
lateral gate is predicted to decrease it to 43.9 Å (3J45, Park, 2013). The maximal distance
was equal to 50.3 Å for a conformation with a closed gate (3DIN) (Fig. 3).

434
435
436
437
438

From SecYEG E62LBT to SecA K797C the distance varies between 30 Å and 40 Å,
depending on the position of the plug in the crystal structure. Both distance estimates are in
the range of the Foerster radii of the donor-acceptor pairs (Tb3+ - ATTO 488, R0=39,72 Å
and Tb3+ - ATTO532, R0=48,14 Å). These radii are calculated form the spectra of the donor
and acceptor according to (32).

As ATP binds terbium stronger than the lanthanide binding tag, LRET experiments were
exclusively performed under nucleotide free conditions. Presence of proOmpA did not
significantly change any of the observed characteristics.

Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)

To estimate the amount of liposomes and protein abundance in proteoliposomes, samples
were subjected to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) as previously described (35).

After having counted the number of proteoliposomes, the samples were dissolved by
detergent (1% Octyl glucoside, 2% Deoxy Big CHAP) and the newly formed micelles were
counted again. By (i) assuming that every micelle contained exactly one SecYEG complex,
and (ii) dividing the number of micelles by the number of the proteoliposomes in the
confocal volume we arrived at the number of SecYEG copies per proteoliposome.

HS-AFM imaging (RIBM, Japan) was performed in measuring buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM
KCl, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.9) at room temperature using USC-F1.2-k0.15
cantilevers (Nanoworld AG, Neuchatel, Switzerland). HS-AFM was operated in tapping
mode with free amplitudes of 1.5 – 2.5 nm. The amplitude setpoint was larger than 90 % of
the free oscillation amplitude. SecA was either incubated or injected on SecYEG containing
periodically suspended membranes (PSMs) which were prepared as previously described
(19). For incubation, 2 µM SecA was added and rinsed with measuring buffer after 2 min.
In the case of injection, SecA was added during HS-AFM imaging to yield final
concentrations of 0.4 – 2 µM. The interaction of SecA and SecYEG (change in height
values) was analyzed using an in-house tool implemented in MATLAB (Mathworks,
Natick, MA).

SPR experiments were performed at room temperature on a Horiba OpenPlex SPRi device
(Horiba France SAS, Longjumeau, France) and lipophilic LP sensor chips (XANTEC,
Duesseldorf, Germany). As running buffer, we used the same measuring buffer as for HSAFM imaging (50 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.9), but with
varying KCl concentrations (10, 50, 200 mM). The flow rate was adjusted to 50 µl/min.
Small unilamellar vesicles, prepared from E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids,
Alabaster, AL) via sonication, were injected at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in the
respective running buffer for 20 min. After formation of a lipid bilayer on the sensor chip,
500 nM SecA His-N20 was injected, followed by sequential injections of SecA with
increasing concentrations (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 nM). Each injection lasted for 10 min,
followed by a 30 min dissociation phase with running buffer. The sensorgrams of these
kinetic titration experiments were processed using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA)
and a two state kinetic model as sketched in Fig. 1D was fit to the data.

binding of SecA to SecYEG was enhanced at physiological salt conditions (100 mM). Two
distinct SecA-SecYEG complexes differing in the penetration depth of SecA’s two-helix
finger into the SecY channel were registered in a detailed analysis of fluorescence decay
curves (A) and (B). The errors arise from averaging of multiple experiments. Obtained
distances for 100mM and 10 mM titrations were pooled (n=8).

SecA upon osmotically triggered fusion of SecYEG-proteoliposomes with planar lipid bilayer. Both
SecYEG-proteoliposomes and SecA were added to cis compartment. High conductivity channels
showed longer opening times (B), as compared to low conductivity channels (C). The buffer
solution contained 25 mM K-HEPES pH 7.5 and 500/100 mM KCl in cis/trans compartments. No
channel activity was observed in the absence of SecA. Applied transmembrane potential was
+50 mV.

Fig. S3 Influence of salt on the SecA-SecYEG binding. (A) Total fluorescence decay
curves (upper panel) and acceptor emission (lower panel) of 50 µM SecA K797C-Atto488
binding to SecYEG G297LBT in detergent (DDM). As denoted in the legend, curves were
vertically shifted (multiplied by 10n) for better visualization. Black curves indicate the result
of the global fitting procedure. (B) Fraction of acceptor emission from a, obtained from a
global single-component acceptor fit. The obtained time constant was 326 ± 3 µs and the
resulting donor-acceptor distance 28.5 ± 0.1 Å (error intervals were calculated form the 95%
confidence interval of the determined lifetime). (C) Same as in (A) but with ATTO532labeled SecA and SecYEG reconstituted into proteoliposomes. (D) Average fractions of fast
and slow lifetimes of two experiments as in (C) normalized to 100% at the highest salt
concentration (accounting for varying orientations of reconstituted SecYEG). (E) Same as
in (C) but with unlabeled SecA. Acceptor emission (lower panel) was zero and total
emission traces were indistinguishable for all [KCl]. (F) Donor lifetimes determined from
the traces in (E) suggesting that a salt dependent shift of donor properties can be excluded.
Error bars denote 95 % confident intervals.

fraction on SecA concentration. Same as Fig. 3C but determined for another LRET pair
(K797C on SecA and E62LBT on SecYEG; Average of n=2 independent experiments,
respectively). Similar as for the G297LBT mutant, two distinct SecA-SecYEG complexes
differing in the penetration depth of SecA’s two-helix finger into the SecY channel were
observed. Calculated donor-acceptor distances represent an average of the pooled distances
calculated from the respective 10 and 100 mM titrations (i.e. n=4).
