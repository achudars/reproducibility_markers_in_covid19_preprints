Abstract:
Cellular and tissue imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, ~1000 - 1350 nm)
is advantageous for in vivo studies because of low light extinction by biological constituents at
these wavelengths. However, deep tissue imaging at the single molecule sensitivity has not been
achieved in the NIR-II window due to lack of suitable bio-probes. Single-walled carbon nanotubes
have emerged as promising near-infrared luminescent molecular bio-probes; yet, their inefficient
photoluminescence (quantum yield ~1%) drives requirements for sizeable excitation doses (~1-10
kW/cm2) that are significantly blue-shifted from the NIR-II region (<850 nm) and may thus
ultimately compromise live tissue. Here, we show that single nanotube imaging can be achieved
in live brain tissue using ultralow excitation doses (~100 W/cm2), an order of magnitude lower
than those currently used. To accomplish this, we synthesized fluorescent sp3-defect tailored (6,5)
carbon nanotubes which, when excited at their first order excitonic transition fluoresce brightly at
~1160 nm. The biocompatibility of these functionalized nanotubes, which are wrapped by stateof-the-art encapsulation agents (phospholipid-polyethylene glycol), is demonstrated using
standard cytotoxicity assays. Single molecule photophysical studies of these biocompatible
nanotubes allowed us to identify the optimal luminescence properties in the context of biological
imaging.

Introduction:
Optical imaging of live biological tissue is a promising and actively developing field with
major expected impacts on the fundamental understanding of various biological processes but also
on diagnostic, therapeutic and health care. Compared to other imaging modalities, optical imaging
offers the combination of exquisite properties including sensitivity (down to single molecule level)
and resolution (molecular) while being compatible with living sample analysis. One major
drawback however is the limited penetration of optical photons into biological tissue. To date,
most high-resolution and/or high-sensitivity imaging methods have been developed at visible
wavelengths (i.e. ~400-700 nm) where light is strongly scattered by the biological constituents. [1]
Strong efforts have also been made to reach the short near-infrared (NIR-I) wavelength range
(~700-1000 nm), also called the diagnostic or therapeutic window, where light better propagates
than visible light into biological tissues. This led to the development of a variety of non-invasive
optical imaging of techniques reaching the single molecule level in living tissue, or, with poorer
sensitivities in the small animal. More recently, two additional red-shifted optical windows have
been identified and referred as the NIR-II (~1000-1350 nm) and NIR-III (~1550-1900 nm) optical
windows with distinct advantages in terms of light scattering and absorption depending on photon
energy. [2,3] In particular, the NIR-II window is attracting high attention for the combination of low
light scattering and absorption by the tissues, resulting in good light penetration depth.
In order to fully exploit the high resolution - high sensitivity properties of optical imaging,
one generally introduces optical nanoprobes into the tissue that are small to access complex
biological environments and display intense optical signals, chiefly fluorescence signals.
Unfortunately, nanoparticles that are optically active into the NIR-II region are uncommon, [4-7]
especially for single particle applications, which require bright emitters. Yet, this would enable
obtaining invaluable information about detailed biological processes in complex tissues with
nanoscale resolutions. Soon after the discovery of their photoluminescence (PL) in the NIR,[8]
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were identified as unique biological probes[9] due to
their unparalleled PL stability and brightness in the NIR and latter complemented by their unique
1D morphology which allow efficient access and dissemination in tissues.[10,11] At the ensemble
level, SWCNTs can be imaged in live cells, tissue and even animals over long periods of time in
the NIR-I optical window but also in the NIR-II and even in the NIR-III optical windows.[9,12] At
the single molecule level, the task is intrinsically difficult due to the relatively weak SWCNT
signals which must compete with any faint source of tissue autofluorescence, light scattering and
absorption. In addition, light excitation necessary to achieve efficient single SWCNT PL must be
compatible with live tissue integrities. [13] Due to these constraints, imaging low concentrations of
SWCNTs, [14,15] notably single SWCNTs [10] into live tissue remains challenging. Note that reduced
sensitivity and higher noise of detectors at NIR wavelengths complicates the task. In this context,
a promising approach would be to enhance simultaneously SWCNT emission and absorption
properties to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio imaging of single SWCNTs in the NIR-II window
using minimal excitation intensities.

SWCNTs have low luminescence quantum yield (QY) [8] due to non-radiative mechanisms
and photoluminescence quenching by structural defects and environmental quencher. [16-20] Mobile
excitons, which are the energy carriers in a SWCNT, can diffuse over one to several hundreds of
nanometers along the nanotube, [17,21] and thus is affected by any PL quenching defect along the
SWCNT length or at its ends. In order to improve this low luminescence QY, an elegant approach
consists in covalently attaching low density chemical functional groups to the SWCNTs, e.g., alkyl
and aryl groups, leading to the creation of sp3 defects that strongly localize the band-edge excitons
into quantum states (E11-) located 100-300 meV below the first bright band-edge exciton level
(E11).[22-28] These sp3 quantum defects, instead of quenching the SWCNT PL photoluminescence,
channel the excitons to the emissive defects leading to more than an order-of-magnitude
brightening effect at the ensemble level.[24] Even ultrashort, essentially non-emissive SWCNTs
become brightly fluorescent with this method.[29] Localized emission at individual defects sites is
directly observed using wide-field PL imaging and even with super-resolution precisions.[29]
Interestingly, the E11- emission of functionalized SWCNTs being red-shifted from the strongest
excitonic transition (E11), one can take advantage of this possibility to generate E11- emission by
direct excitation at the E11 transition.[23]
Here, we show that bright, biocompatible p-nitroaryl functionalized SWCNTs (fSWCNTs) encapsulated in phospholipid-polyethylene glycol (PL-PEG) are suitable for
application in single molecule bio-imaging. We demonstrate imaging of these f-SWCNTs in live
organotypic brain tissues at the single nanotube level and compare the results with the
biocompatible unfunctionalized analogue (unf-SWCNTs). The f-SWCNTs enable high signal-tonoise ratio imaging within the NIR-II region (985 nm excitation, 1160 nm emission) using
excitation intensities that are one order of magnitude less than those required for the biocompatible
unf-SWCNTs (985 nm excitation and emission).
Materials and Methods:
unf-SWCNT encapsulation in phospholipid-polyethylene glycol (PL-PEG). CoMoCAT SG65i
nanotubes were suspended by 0.5 % w/v PL-PEG (MPEG-DSPE-5000, Layson Bio. Inc., Arab,
AL, USA) in deuterium oxide (D2O). 1 mg of raw SWCNTs was added to 10 mL of the PL-PEG
solution. The mixture was homogenized and sonicated with a tip sonicator (Misonix-XL 2000, 20
W output) for 8 min in an ice bath. Nanotube bundles and impurities were precipitated by
centrifugation (Beckman Coulter, 50.2 Ti rotor) at 6000 rpm for 60 min at room temperature. The
supernatant was collected and stored at 4°C until further use. The absorption spectrum (400-1000
nm) was recorded for every suspension with a spectrometer (Cary 5000). The concentration of the
PL-PEG-coated SWCNT was estimated to be 0.36 µg mL-1 based on the optical absorbance at 808
nm.[30]
Covalent incorporation of fluorescent sp3 defects in SWCNTs. SWCNTs were covalently
functionalized by p-nitro aryl groups (-C6H5NO2) using a diazonium reaction in oleum. 3 mg of
raw CoMoCAT SG65i SWCNTs (99%, Lot No. SG65i-L39, SouthWest NanoTechnologies) were
added to 10 mL of oleum (20% free SO3, Sigma-Aldrich) and stirred overnight. (Safety note:
Oleum is extremely acidic and corrosive. The reaction must be performed within a fume hood with

protective gloves and masks.) 0.86 mg of sodium nitrite (NaNO2; analytical standard, SigmaAldrich) and 1.75 mg of p-nitroaniline (analytical standard, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the
SWCNT/oleum suspension at a molar ratio of SWNCT carbon relative to p-nitroaniline of 20:1.
The mixture was heated to 75°C using an oil bath, and 2.5 mg of azobisisobutyronitrile (98%,
Sigma-Aldrich) was then added to initiate the reaction. After 20 min of stirring at 75°C, the system
was removed from the oil bath and cooled to room temperature. The SWCNT-oleum suspension
was added dropwise to 250 mL of a 2.0 M aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (97%, SigmaAldrich) until the solution reached pH 8. (Safety note: This neutralization step must be performed
slowly with stirring within a fume hood in order to avoid the production of excessive heat or toxic
fumes.) The neutralized SWCNT suspension was filtered by vacuum over a 80 nm pore size tracketched polycarbonate membrane and the filter cake was rinsed with copious water and ethanol to
remove unreacted chemicals. The f-SWCNTs obtained on the filter paper were dried in vacuum
for 1 h and then re-dispersed in 1% w/v DOC-D2O by probe sonication with a 3.2 mm diameter
microtip at 8 W for 1 h.
Direct and exchanged f-SWCNT. The f-SWCNTs were either dispersed directly in 0.5% w/v
PL-PEG by probe sonication for 1 h at 4 W, or first dispersed in 1% w/v DOC-D2O for 1 h, again
by sonication at 4 W, then exchanged with 0.5% PL-PEG-D2O by pressure filtration (Amicon
Stirred Cell, EMD Millipore). The photoluminescence of nanotube solutions was collected using
a NanoLog spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon). The samples were excited with a 450 W
Xenon source dispersed by a double-grating monochromator. The PL spectra were then collected
using a liquid-N2 cooled linear InGaAs array detector. The slit widths for both the excitation and
emission were set at 10 nm.
Cell culture studies. Hela cells were cultured on microscope coverslips in Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with streptomycin (100 g/mL), penicillin (100 U/mL), and
10% bovine serum in a 95% humidified atmosphere, 5% CO2, at 37°C. Cells were cultured every
three to four days and used up to passage 20.
Cell proliferation assay. Hela cells were incubated with SWCNTs at a final concentration of 5
µg/mL in DMEM for one day or four days at 5% CO2 at 37°C. The cells were then cleaved from
the coverslips using trypsin (1%) and harvested by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min, after
which the cells were suspended in 1 mL of DMEM. For cell counting, using microscopy at 10X
magnification, a 10 µL drop of the sample was placed at the center of hemocytometer and covered
with a coverslip. The sample was mounted on a homemade microscope with white light
illumination at room temperature and cells were counted. The cell number was calculated and
normalized by the control cell number without nanotube incubation.
Cell viability assay. For the cell viability assay, two sets of Hela cells were grown in a 96-well
tissue culture plates for either one or four days. In each well, 200 µL of the cell sample was
incubated in 20 µL of Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1 (Sigma Aldrich) for 1.5 h at room
temperature to lyse the cells. After the incubation period, the resulting formazan dye was
quantitated with a scanning multi-well plate spectrophotometer (Biorad iMark plate reader). The

absorbance directly correlates to the number of viable cells. Blank absorption collected only from
the same volume of culture media, and WST-1 reagent (in the absence of cells) was subtracted
from each absorbance value. Control cells were prepared by following the same protocol, but
without SWCNTs administration. The viable cell fractions (percentages) were calculated by
normalizing the cell number with nanotube incubation by the control cell number without nanotube
incubation.
Single Nanotube Photoluminescence Imaging. SWCNT PL imaging was performed with an
inverted microscope equipped with a 60X (1.40 NA) objective and two detection arms separated
by a 50/50 beam splitter. A tunable Ti-sapphire laser (Spectra Physics, Model 3900S) was to excite
the (6,5) SWCNTs at their K-momentum exciton-phonon sideband (845 nm). In addition, a 985
nm diode laser was used to resonantly excite the functionalized (6,5)-SWCNTs at their first order
excitonic transition (E11). Fluorescence was collected with the same objective and imaged on an
InGaAs camera (Ninox, Raptor Photonics), in order to produce wide-field images of individual
SWCNTs. A dichroic mirror (FF875-Di01, Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA) and the combination
of long- and short-pass emission filters (ET900LP, Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT,
USA; FESH1000, Thorlabs SAS, Maisons-Laffitte, France) were used to illuminate the sample
and detect SWCNT fluorescence at 985 nm. Images of SWCNTs were recorded with 30 ms
integration time per frame. A dichroic mirror (FF875-Di01, Semrock) in combination with longpass emission filters (RazorEdge 1064, Semrock) for (6,5) f-SWCNTs was used to illuminate the
sample and select PL from the E11- state only. PL from E11 and the E11- were detected with the
InGaAs camera. For imaging immobilized SWCNTs, the suspended SWCNT samples were spincoated on a microscope glass coverslip pre-coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone. In this work, unless
otherwise stated, the PL of an individual SWCNT is defined as the signal integrated over the pixels
from the nanotube image. In Figure 3A, the reported luminescence brightness of the unf-SWCNTs
was multiplied by 1.034 to account for the difference of detection efficiency of the InGaAs camera
between 985 nm and 1160 nm.
Organotypic Tissue Preparation. Organotypic slice cultures were prepared as previously
described.31 Briefly, 350-µm hippocampal slices were obtained from postnatal day 5 (P5) to P7
Sprague-Dawley rats using a McIlwain tissue chopper, and were placed in a pre-heated (37°C)
dissection medium containing 175 mM sucrose, 25 mM D-glucose, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2,
2.5 mM KCl, 0.66 mM KH2PO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.28 mM MgSO4-7H2O, 0.85 mM Na2HPO412H2O, 2.7 mM NaHCO3 and 0.4 mM HEPES, 2 × 10-5% phenol red, pH 7.3 (all products from
Sigma Aldrich unless specified). After 25 min of incubation, slices were transferred onto white
hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene membranes (0.45 µm; Millipore FHLC) set on Millicell Cell
Culture Inserts (Millipore, 0.4 mm; 30 mm diameter), and cultured for up to 14 days on multiwellplates at 35°C/5% CO2 in a culture medium composed of 50% Basal Medium Eagle, 25% Hank’s
balanced salt solution 1X (with MgCl2/with CaCl2), 25% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.45% Dglucose and 1 mM L-glutamine (all products from Gibco unless specified). The medium was
changed every 2-3 days.

Organotypic Tissue Imaging. The tissue slices were first incubated with SWCNT for ~2 h, and
then the slices were mounted in a ludin chamber for image acquisition. The ludin chamber was
filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution (126 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1.3
mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3 and 12.1 mM glucose; gassed with 95% O2: 5%
CO2; pH 7.35) at room temperature. (6,5)-SWCNTs were selectively excited within the tissue at
845 nm by a tunable Ti-Sa laser (Spectra Physics, Model 3900S) and 985 nm by a diode laser
(Thorlabs). The incident laser beam, circularly-polarized at the sample to ensure that SWCNTs are
excited regardless of their orientation in the sample plane, was focused into the back aperture of
an objective (Nikon, 60x, NA 1.0) mounted on an upright microscope (Nikon TiE eclipse; Tokyo,
Japan). The emission was collected with the same objective and imaged on the same camera to
produce wide-field images of individual SWCNTs within the tissue. A dichroic mirror (FF875Di01; Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA) and the combination of long-pass emission filters
(ET900LP, Chroma Technology Corp. and RazorEdge 1064, Semrock) were used to illuminate
and detect PL of SWCNTs inside deep tissues. Images of SWCNTs were recorded with 30 ms
integration time per frame.
Results and Discussion
Biocompatible functionalized nanotubes (the f-SWCNT). The f-SWCNTs were prepared by
covalent functionalization of CoMoCAT SG65i nanotubes with p-nitroaryl groups using
aryldiazonium salts in oleum. The functionalized nanotubes were collected by vacuum filtration
and re-dispersed in 0.5% w/v PL-PEG or 1% w/v DOC/D2O by probe sonication (see Materials
and Methods). Successful incorporation of the fluorescent sp3 defects in (6,5)-SWCNTs is directly
confirmed from the observation of the intense defect PL (E11-) at 1160 nm, which is redshifted
from the the native PL (E11) from unfunctionalized segments of the (6,5) nanotubes.
We then suspended the f-SWCNT in PL-PEG, which improves the biocompatibility of SWCNTs.
[32,33]
Note that while the use of surfactants such as sodium deoxycholate or sodium
dodecylbenzene sulfonate result in solutions with brighter nanotubes, [32] these surfactants are not
applicable to in-vivo imaging, as they are detrimental to cell membrane integrity. Two different
methods were explored for SWCNT dispersion from the filter cake. The first one was to directly
disperse the SWCNTs in PL-PEG while the second one consisted in first dispersing the f-SWCNTs
in 1% DOC-D2O then exchanging the surfactant with 0.5% PL-PEG-D2O by pressure filtration.
Interestingly, the second method led to samples having higher PL brightness than the first one
when comparing identically concentrated nanotube solutions (Figure 1B). This is probably due to
the superior efficiency of DOC to individualize small diameter nanotubes from dry into aqueous
environments.[34] Owing to their biocompatibility and photoluminescence brightness, we
exclusively chose the exchanged f-SWCNT for all following experiments. To monitor their
suitability and usefulness for biological applications, we next performed biocompatibility and
cytotoxicity studies toward live cells using the standard Hela cell line.

with native PL (E11) and defect emission (E11-) peaks at 985 nm and 1160 nm, respectively. (B)
Emission spectra of the f-SWCNTs prepared by two different methods: (red) directly stabilized in
PL-PEG and (blue) stabilized in DOC then exchanged into PL-PEG by pressure filtration. The
nanotube concentrations were adjusted to 0.36 µg mL-1. The excitation wavelength was 565 nm.
Cytotoxicity Experiments. In order to address the potential cytotoxicity of f-SWCNTs, we first
performed a cell proliferation study upon incubation with a final nanotube concentration of 5
µg/mL. The cell numbers were counted after 1 day and after 4 days using a hemocytometer under
a white light microscope. Two controls were also used: cell incubation with unf-SWCNTs
encapsulated in PL-PEG (using the same concentration) and without nanotube application. In these
experiments, the initial quantity of Hela cells was adjusted to 8´104 cells/mL. In accordance with
previous studies, unf-SWCNTs encapsulated in PL-PEG showed minimal cell proliferation
inhibition at both time points as compared to control cells (more than 80%). [32] Importantly, fSWCNTs showed an identical behavior (Figure 2A).
In order to check cell viability, we complemented this analysis by the standard WST-1
assay that is used widely for analysis of acute cytotoxicity.[35] In this case, HeLa cells were
incubated (5´104 cells/mL) with unf- and f-SWCNTs, with a final concentration of 20 µg/mL.
After 1 day and after 4 days, viable cells were identified using WST-1 staining and cell viability
was calculated (see Materials and Methods). Cell viabilities were greater than 90% after 1 day and
70% after 4 days of incubation (Figure 2B). Note that in this experiment, much higher nanotube
concentrations were employed than for typical in vivo or tissue imaging (~0.1 to 0.2 µg/mL). We
can thus conclude that the f-SWCNTs encapsulated in PL-PEG can be safely applied for imaging
application in live tissue.

WST-1. SWCNT concentration in the cell culture: 20 µg/mL. In both assays, cell proliferation and
viability were compared with the blank control sample without SWCNTs.

Photoluminescence characterization of f-SWCNTs and comparison with unf-SWCNTs. We
next compared the photoluminescence brightness of the PL-PEG wrapped unf- and f-SWCNT at
the single nanotube level under different illuminations conditions. We excited both nanotubes
types in solution at their second order transition (E22, 568 nm for (6,5) nanotubes) with identical
excitation laser intensity (0.3 kW/cm2). In Figure 3A, the cumulative distribution of E11- PL of
individual f-SWCNTs (N=16473) is compared with that of the E11 PL of single unf-SWCNTs
(N=22425). Under the identical excitation intensity, f-SWCNTs used in this work display 1.5times higher photoluminescence brightness than their unfunctionalized counterpart at the single
nanotube level. Note that brightening induced by sp3 nanotube functionalization, which was
previously observed in different preparations, depends on several parameters including nanotube
length, functional group nature (alkyl/aryl), starting SWCNT quality, functionalization density,
etc.[24,25,29,36,37] PL brightness is thus not an intrinsic parameter in sp3-functionalised nanotubes and
should be characterized for a specific sample. In this work, brightening following functionalization
is modest compared to previous reports that are better optimized for brightness, yet in the
following, we will show that the f-SWCNTs offer additional benefits that are intrinsic to sp3functionalisation in the context of biological imaging.

and f-SWCNT (E11-, blue line) resulting from 568 nm excitation at 0.3 kW/cm2. PL intensity

filter (C) Image of E11- photoluminescence from individual f-SWCNTs recorded using a 1064 nm

For applications in biological imaging, a visible excitation source, such as the one used in Figure
3 (568 nm) is not ideal due to limited tissue penetration depth and tissue autofluorescence which
produces substantial background noise.[3,38] To solve this problem in the case of unf-SWCNTs, the
best option identified to date was to excite the K-momentum exciton-phonon sideband (KSB) of
E11 which lies at 845 nm for (6,5)-SWCNTs.[13] However, excitation at the KSB still resides far
from the NIR-II window and it requires substantial excitation intensities (at the kW/cm2 level) to
generate bright SWCNT PL for detection at the single molecule level. In contrast, f-SWCNTs
provide a more elegant solution: direct excitation from their first order transition, E11 (985 nm in
the case of (6,5)-SWCNTs, which is within the therapeutic window and at the edge of the NIR-II
region) and detection from defect-induced E11- (1160 nm deep in the NIR-II region). In order to
evaluate the robustness of f-SWCNTs for in vivo imaging, we compared the performance of the
two nanotube types as a function of excitation intensity and excitation wavelength at singlenanotube level (Figure 4). In all cases, non-linear saturation curves are observed in accordance
with previous studies. Upon 845 nm excitation, both (6,5) unf-SWNCT and (6,5) f-SWCNT
display rather similar photoexcitation efficiencies. Upon 985 nm excitation however, E119

photoluminescence (at 1160 nm) for f-SWCNTs is significantly more efficient than upon 845 nm
excitation. This was expected because of one order of magnitude higher absorption at the E11
wavelength than at the KSB. Accordingly, the saturation intensity obtained by curve fitting is ~8
times lower upon 985 nm excitation than 845 nm (0.24 kW/cm2 vs 1.9 kW/cm2) (Figure 4A). We
additionally measured the photostability of individual f-SWCNTs for up to 10 minutes under
continuous excitation at 985 nm (Figure 4B). This quantitative analysis directly indicates that sp3functionalized nanotubes can display similar photoluminescence rates to unfunctionalized
nanotubes using significantly lower energy excitation and more importantly, with one order of
magnitude less excitation intensities.

laser intensity. (B) Luminescence photostability of individual f-SWCNTs for up to 10 minutes under

Brain Tissue Imaging. We next used this knowledge to demonstrate that biocompatible fSWCNTs can be instrumental for deep tissue imaging at the single nanotube level. For this, we
chose live brain tissues as an archetypical system because single SWCNT detection and tracking
were shown to provide unique knowledge about the brain extracellular space environment. [10,15,39]
Organotypic rat brain tissue slices were prepared from P5-7 rat pups and maintained in culture
medium at 35 °C/5% CO2 until imaging. Unf- or f-SWCNTs were delivered identically into brain
tissues by incubation (120 minutes) and mounted in a ludin chamber containing the artificial
cerebrospinal fluid under the microscope for imaging. Circularly polarized light was used to ensure
nanotubes were excited irrespective of their orientation to the incident source. Individual
nanotubes were detected in diverse areas of the brain slices, both for 845 nm excitation (unfSWCNTs) or for 985 nm excitation (f-SWCNTs). Efficient nanotube dissemination in the tissue

photostability enabled individual nanotubes to be imaged at video rate for extended times (tens of
minutes) with neither evidence of photobleaching nor visible photodamage to the tissue observed.

Figure 5: Live brain tissue imaging using SWCNTs. (A) unf-SWCNTs (845 nm excitation;
2.5 kW/cm2) and (B) f-SWCNTs (985 nm excitation; 100 W/cm2) are detected at depths >15 µm
inside live brain slices. (C) and (D) Image section along the profiles (dashed lines) indicated in
(A) and (B), respectively for unf-SWCNTs (red) and f-SWCNTs (black) display equivalent PL
intensity at their respective emission wavelengths using different excitation intensities. (E) Signalto-noise (mean ± stdev) values for unf- and f-SWCNT were each obtained from 10 individual
nanotubes.
Figures 5A and 5B are characteristic images of unf- and f-SWCNTs located at depths of
more than 15 µm inside the live brain slices. For this experiment 845 nm excitation was adjusted
in situ to 2,500 W/cm2 to excite unf-SWCNTs while only 100 W/cm2 was necessary to efficiently
excite f-SWCNTs as displayed in Figure 5. More quantitatively, by comparing SWCNTs
displaying similar signals (i.e. ~500 camera counts), the corresponding signal to noise ratio (S/N,
as average value evaluated for 10 individual nanotubes) were ~ 7 for unf-SWCNTs excited at 845
nm and ~ 11 for f-SWCNTs excited at 985 nm (Figure 5C & 5D). Note that f-SWCNTs excited at

845 nm with 1.3 kW/cm2 displayed a S/N of ~ 9. Several factors contribute to this better
performance for f-SWCNTs. First, light attenuation, scattering and background noise are
minimized in the NIR-II region (1000-1700 nm), in which f-SWCNTs emit. More precisely the
primary contributions to elevated background signals in NIR-I as compared to NIR-II are
scattering of emitted photons which degrade image formations by ballistic photons, and
autofluorescence from biological media. Moreover, the large absorbance cross-section of the E11
transition lowers the required excitation intensity, which consequently reduces light scattering,
absorption, and tissue autofluorescence that results from excitation. Note that the blurry signals,
particularly visible in Figure 5B, correspond to out-of-focus f-SWCNTs and not cellular tissue
background as they can be resolved by changing the focus at the camera. Altogether, combination
of more efficient excitation and improved imaging in the NIR-II region led to better S/N PL
imaging ratio using less than 20 times the light excitation dose for imaging single f-SWCNTs
which is an obvious advantage for non-invasive bioimaging.
Conclusion.
Sensitive fluorescence microscopy deep within live biological samples using minimal light
excitation dose for broad applications of high-resolution fluorescence approaches in biological
science has been demonstrated using chemically modified SWCNTs. The synthesized f-SWCNTs
are biocompatible and fluoresce brightly in the NIR-II due to the incorporated sp3 defects, making
them suitable for single nanotube imaging in live brain tissues. We quantitatively demonstrated
single nanotube imaging in the NIR-II region at high signal-to-noise ratios using unprecedentedly
low excitation intensities (100 W/cm2) that are an order of magnitude lower than those previously
reported for SWCNTs. This work paves the way toward the application of sp3 defect-tailored
nanotubes as single-molecule probes [39] and chemical/molecular sensors [15,40] in live biological
tissues.
