Summary
The functional contribution of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) to the
synaptic organization of the striatum is poorly understood. Using electrophysiological
recordings, optogenetic stimulation, and single-cell PCR analysis, we investigated
functional patterns of synaptic connectivity in striatal SST-INs expressing
channelrhodopsin-2. Photostimulation of these cells induced both glutamatergic excitatory
postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in
striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). The two
synaptic components showed equally fast onset latencies, suggesting a mechanism of cotransmission. Accordingly, single-cell PCR analysis revealed that individual striatal SSTINs expressed mRNAs for both glutamate and GABA vesicular transporters (VGLUT1 and
VGAT, respectively). During relatively prolonged optical stimuli (0.5-1s), IPSC arrays
consistently outlasted EPSCs. As a result, photostimulation of SST-INs caused a transient
burst of action potentials followed by a prolonged inhibition in postsynaptic cells.
These data suggest that striatal SST-INs are specialized to locally project synapses
exerting a composite excitatory and inhibitory effect through GABA/glutamate cotransmission onto different postsynaptic targets.

Introduction
Somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) are known as a class of GABAergic
interneurons residing in several areas of the brain (Kawaguchi et al., 1995; Freund and
Buzsaki, 1996; Katona et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2004; Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005;
Rudy et al., 2011; Sturgill and Isaacson, 2015; Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016;
Ramaswamy et al., 2017). They mostly provide dendritic inhibition (Freund and Buzsaki,
1996; Pouille and Scanziani, 2004; Lovett-Barron et al., 2012; Royer et al., 2012), play an
essential role in sensorimotor integration, learning, and memory (Gentet et al., 2012;
Lovett-Barron et al., 2014; Stefanelli et al., 2016), and are involved in a variety of
neurological disorders (Schmid et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Fuchs et al., 2017). SSTINs also represent an important subtype of interneurons in the striatum, the main input
area of the basal ganglia (BG) which plays a critical role in reinforcement learning,
voluntary movement, goal-directed behavior, and development of habits (Yin et al., 2005;
Balleine et al., 2007; Surmeier et al., 2009; Gremel and Costa, 2013). Striatal SST-INs
display neurochemical and electrophysiological properties, such as high input resistance
and Ca2+ channel-mediated low-threshold spiking, or LTS (Kawaguchi, 1993; Partridge et
al., 2009; Tepper et al., 2010; Beatty et al., 2012; Elghaba et al., 2016; Holley et al., 2019),
broadly similar to those described in cortical and hippocampal SST-INs (Oliva et al., 2000;
Taverna et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006; Yekhlef et al., 2015; Nigro et al.,
2018), and distinct from those of other major cell types such as spiny projection neurons
(SPNs, (Taverna et al., 2008; Kreitzer, 2009), fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs; (Koos and
Tepper, 1999; Russo et al., 2013), and other striatal populations (Tepper et al., 2018).
SST-INs are generally known as inhibitory cells using GABA as a primary neurotransmitter
and co-expressing several neuromodulators including somatostatin, neuropeptide-Y (NPY)
and nitric oxide (NO) (Cannizzaro et al., 2003; Galarraga et al., 2007; Lopez-Huerta et al.,
2008; Blomeley et al., 2015; Rafalovich et al., 2015). Anatomically, these neurons display

3

large, sparsely branched dendrites and a very stretched axonal arborization (Kawaguchi,
1993; Ibanez-Sandoval et al., 2011). These properties suggest that SST-INs make
synaptic contacts with cellular targets which may reside relatively far away from the
presynaptic soma, posing a challenge to the investigation of synaptic properties with
paired recordings. Recent studies have obviated this problem using optogenetic
stimulation, reporting new insights in the synaptic organization of these cells and stressing
their preference for long-distanced postsynaptic targets (Straub et al., 2016). However, the
influence of SST-INs on postsynaptic firing activity has not been described in detail yet,
leaving a gap in our understanding of striatal circuits. Here we investigated functional
synaptic release properties of intrastriatal SST-INs in mouse brain slices using patch
clamp recordings, optogenetic stimulation, and single-cell PCR analysis. We found that
optical stimulation of these cells resulted in an efficient co-transmission of GABA and
glutamate, evoking simultaneous arrays of EPSCs and IPSCs and generating a consistent
firing activation-inhibition sequence in postsynaptic SPNs and FSIs. These properties were
more evident in relatively older mice (>p45) and were not shared with cortical and
hippocampal SST-INs, which were purely inhibitory.
The atypical, fast excitatory-inhibitory sequence induced by GABA/glutamate cotransmission following SST-IN activation adds an important contribution to the complexity
of synaptic integrative properties in striatal principal cells and fast-spiking interneurons.

Materials and Methods
Slice preparation and electrophysiology
Recordings were performed in cortico-striatal slices prepared from a recombinant Crelox mouse line obtained by crossing B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm27.1(CAGCOP4*H134R/tdTomato)Hze/J mice (Ai27D, JAX stock number: 012567; Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) with B6N.Cg-Ssttm2.1(cre)Zjh/J (Sst-IRES-Cre, JAX
stock No. 018973). For FSI photostimulation we crossed Ai27D mice with 129P2Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr mice (PVcre, JAX stock No. 008069). The offsprings, which appeared
viable and healthy, selectively expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in SST- or
parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells, respectively. All procedures were approved by the
Italian Ministry of Health and the San Raffaele Scientific Institute Animal Care and Use
Committee in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Mice of both sexes
(30-90 days of age) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of
ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and perfused transcardially with
ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25
NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 1 MgCl2, and 11 D-glucose, saturated with 95% O2 and
5% CO2 (pH 7.3). After decapitation, brains were removed from the skull and 300μm-thick
parasagittal slices (horizontal for thalamic stimulation experiments) were cut in ACSF at
4°C using a VT1000S vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Individual slices
were then submerged in a recording chamber mounted on the stage of an upright BX51WI
microscope (Olympus, Japan) equipped with differential interference contrast optics (DIC).
Slices were perfused with ACSF continuously flowing at a rate of 2-3 ml/min at 32°C.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in dorsolateral striatum and
somatosensory cortex using pipettes filled with a solution containing the following (in mM):
10 NaCl, 124 KH2PO4, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 2 Na2-ATP, 0.02 Na-GTP, (pH 7.2,
adjusted with KOH; tip resistance: 4-6 MΩ). All recordings were performed using a

5

MultiClamp 700B amplifier interfaced with a PC through a Digidata 1440A (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The liquid junction potential was not corrected. The series
resistance was partially compensated (40-50%) using the amplifier control circuit. Data
were acquired using pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices) and analyzed with Origin 9.1
(Origin Lab, Northampton, MA, USA). Voltage- and current-clamp traces were sampled at
a frequency of 30 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. The cell input resistance (Rin) was
calculated by dividing the peak voltage change value in response to the injection of a
hyperpolarizing current step (-100 pA) in current clamp recordings. Latencies between
optical stimuli and ChR2-induced direct or synaptic currents were measured as the time
gap between stimulus trigger start (recorded as a digital output trace in pClamp) and
current onset, defined as the time at which membrane potential traces deflected by a value
equal to at least twice the standard deviation (SD) of the baseline mean value preceding
the stimulus. Compound IPSC and EPSC durations were measured as the time interval
between current onset and earliest time point marking a full decay of the last PSC to
baseline.
Photostimulation of ChR2-expressing interneurons
Optical stimuli were generated using a diode-pumped solid state laser (wavelength: 473
nm; Shanghai Dream Lasers Technology, Shanghai, China) connected to the epiillumination port of the microscope through a multi-mode optical fiber. The beam was
deflected by a dichroic mirror and conveyed to the slice through a 40x water-immersion
objective (spot size: 0.06 mm2). The light power measured with an optical power meter at
the level of the slice surface was ~2 mW, yielding a light density value of ~33 mW/mm2.
Photostimuli were TTL-triggered using Clampex digital output signals.
Single-cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Neurons in slices obtained from mice aged p55-p65 were visually identified and their
firing patterns were recorded in order to confirm their functional identity. Patch pipettes

6

were filled with an autoclaved internal solution containing the following (in mM): 140 KCl,
5 EGTA, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.3 with KOH. After recording, the cytoplasm was harvested
into the pipette by gently applying negative pressure. An initial reverse transcription (RT)
reaction was conducted after pressure ejection of the cytoplasm into a microcentrifuge
tube containing the REPLI-g WTA single cell kit (Qiagen). Each cell was incubated in a
total volume of 5.5 μl at 24°C for 5 min and then cooled to 4°C. Cells were subsequently
treated for 10 min at 42°C with 1 μl gDNA wipeout buffer before adding 3.5 μl RT mix to
synthesize first strand cDNA (RT mix: 0.5 μl oligodT primer, 2 μl RT buffer, 0.5 μl
random primer and 0.5 μl RT enzyme mix). The tubes were incubated at 42°C for 1 h,
then at 95°C for 3 min. A ligation step was subsequently carried out at 24°C for 30 min
with 5 μl ligation mix (4 μl ligase buffer and 1 μl ligase mix) for each sample. The
reaction was stopped by incubating at 95°C for 5 min. The final amplification step was
performed at 30°C for 2 h after adding the amplification mix (15 μl buffer and 0.5 μl
REPLI-g SensiPhi DNA polymerase), eventually raising the temperature to 65°C for
5 min to stop the reaction.
Single cell PCRs were performed on diluted cDNA (1:100) using Go-Taq polymerase
(Promega) with the following protocol: [94° 5’ – 35x(94 30” - 60 30” - 72 1’30”) - 72° 7’]
For VGAT, a nested PCR was performed where the final amplification was made using the
protocol described above while the following protocol was used as first step: [94° 5’ –
35x(94 30” - 55 30” - 72 1’30”) - 72° 7’]. Every PCR was loaded on 2% agarose gel for
visualization. VGAT and VGLUT1 bands were extracted from gel and further examined by
Sanger sequencing (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland).

Immunohistochemistry
Mice were intracardially perfused using a peristaltic pump connected to a needle
inserted in the left ventricle. We first injected 10 ml of cold ACSF followed by 20 ml of
paraformaldehyde (PFA) dissolved at 4% w/v in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C.
Brains were then quickly removed and post-fixed in PFA overnight at 4°C. Sagittal sections
(15μm thick) were cut using a cryostat (Leica). Slices were permeabilized with a blocking
solution containing 0.3% Triton-X100, 1% bovine serum albumin, or BSA, and PBS, and
incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution (anti-SST 1:100 v/v,
Millipore, and anti-red fluorescent protein 1:400 v/v, Rockland Immunochemicals,
overnight at 4°C). Slices were then washed for 1h by alternating PBS and blocking solution
every 15 min, and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1:200 v/v in
blocking buffer solution for 2h at room temperature (anti-rat ALexa488, anti-mouse
Alexa546, Jackson Immunoresearch). After incubation with secondary antibodies, slices
were washed for 2h by alternating blocking solution and PBS every 15 min, then rinsed in
PBS and mounted with an anti-fading agent (Fluor Safe, Millipore). Images were collected
using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope.

Statistical analysis
Results were compared using paired or unpaired Student’s t-tests and ANOVA for
normally distributed datasets, and Mann-Whitney rank sum tests otherwise (SigmaStat,
Systat Software, Chicago, IL). Population rates were compared using a Z-score test for
two populations. Results are given as means ± s.e.m. in text and represented by box plots
in figures. Boxes include 25th and 75th percentiles (horizontal edges), median value (inner
line), and min-max values (whiskers). Differences were considered significant at p<0.05.
Drugs
All drugs were obtained from Sigma except 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium salt (NBQX) and 2-(3carboxypropyl)-3-amino-6-(4 methoxyphenyl)pyridazinium bromide (gabazine) which were
obtained from Hello Bio (Bristol, UK).

Results
Photostimulation specifically activates SST-INs.
Individual striatal cells were first recorded in order to assess the typical identity of SSTINs (Kawaguchi et al., 1995; Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000; Beatty et al., 2012) in
fluorescent cells in slices prepared from SST-ChR2 mice. Visually identified, red
fluorescent cells invariably displayed the electrical properties of SST-INs, namely a
relatively high Rin (350 ± 31 Mn = 30), a prominent depolarizing sag in response to
injection of hyperpolarizing current pulses, and post-inhibition rebound firing (Figure 1A).
The great majority of these cells (29 out of 30, 97%) readily fired trains of action potentials
in response to direct illumination with blue light. We found some variability in the frequency
response of SST-INs to either current injection or photostimulation, so that a fraction of
cells (19 out of 30, 63%) displayed a relatively regular AP firing pattern with little or no

9

adaptation, while the remainder (11 out of 30, 37%) were more irregular or strongly
adapting. In any case, ChR2 expression was highly co-localized (>80%) with anti-SST
immunohistochemical labeling (Figure 1B; (Yekhlef et al., 2015)). Conversely, all recorded
cells with electrophysiological features typical of SPNs (N = 130; (Taverna et al., 2008)),
FSIs (N = 26; (Russo et al., 2013)), cholinergic interneurons (N = 10; (Wilson et al., 1990)),
and cortical principal cells (N = 12; (Yekhlef et al., 2015)) displayed no fluorescence
associated with ChR2 expression and lack of light-induced direct depolarization,
suggesting that photostimulation robustly activated SST-INs with a high degree of
specificity.

SST-INs co-release both GABA and glutamate onto SPNs.
Photostimulation of SST-INs elicited a composite synaptic response in individual
postsynaptic cells. During voltage-clamp recordings in SPNs at a Vh of -80 mV, blue light
flashes (0.5-1s) evoked a compound inward current (mean peak amplitude: -113 ± 16 pA,
n = 53; Figure 1C, black trace). After extracellular perfusion with the GABAA receptor
antagonist gabazine (GBZ, 10 M), a smaller but consistent residual compound current
was unmasked (mean peak amplitude: -59 ± 13 pA; p<0.01, n = 30, Mann-Whitney Rank
Sum Test; Figure 1C, green trace; we used an unpaired statistical test since in some
cases cells were recorded when GBZ was already present in the extracellular ACSF).
Such current was completely inhibited by the AMPA-receptor antagonist NBQX (5M;
Figure 1C, gray trace), suggesting that SST-IN photostimulation induced synaptic release
of both glutamate and GABA that were functionally active on SPN postsynaptic receptors.
Interestingly, the average duration of the AMPA-receptor-mediated compound current
(IAMPA –normalized to the flash duration, since in some cases we used different stimulation
lengths across experiments) was significantly shorter than the GABAA-R-mediated
component (IGABA) recorded in 5M NBQX (40 ± 4% vs. 94 ± 4%, respectively, n = 10, p =

10

0.001, unpaired t test; Figure 1D). IAMPA and IGABA were also distinguished by their different
reversal potentials (Erev), as both inward EPSCs (estimated Erev= 0 mV) and outward
IPSCs (estimated Erev= -60mV) were detected during relatively prolonged flashes (150 ms)
at an intermediate Vh (-40 mV; Figure 1E). In addition, individual EPSCs elicited with brief
light pulses (5 ms) at Vh = -80 mV in the presence of GBZ had a significantly faster decay
time constant (dec) than IPSCs recorded at the same Vh in the presence of NBQX (6.3 ±
1.0 ms vs. 10.8 ± 1.0 ms, respectively, n = 7, p<0.05, unpaired t test; Figure 1F, inset),
confirming the identity of the two synaptic components. Importantly, the average latencies
of EPSCs and IPSCs were nearly identical (9.4 ± 0.6 ms vs. 9.7 ± 1.0 ms, respectively, n =
7, p=0.8, unpaired t test; Figure 1F). Altogether, these data suggest that both GABA and
glutamate are simultaneously released onto striatal SPNs in response to photoactivation of
SST-INs. However, the glutamatergic response is relatively fast-depressing and persists
for a significantly shorter time than the inhibitory component.

Figure 1. GABAergic and glutamatergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs) evoked by SST-IN
photostimulation. A: electrical properties of a regular-spiking SST-INs in response to injection of
current steps (500 ms, left) and direct photostimulation with blue light at 470nm (1s, right). The
upper trace on the right is from the same cell as that in the left panel, while the bottom is from a
different SST-INs showing an irregular firing pattern in response to light. B: confocal
microphotographs showing examples of anti-SST immunostaining co-localizing with ChR-2
expression. C: voltage clamp traces representing a compound PSC (Ctrl) recorded in a striatal SPN
in response to SST-IN photostimulation. Extracellular perfusion with the GABAA-receptor antagonist
gabazine (GBZ, 10M) unmasked a smaller, rapidly-depressing compound EPSC that was
completely blocked by the AMPA-receptor antagonist NBQX (5M). Summary plots of PSC peak
amplitudes are shown on the right (**p<0.01). D: pharmacologically isolated compound IPSCs and
EPSCs evoked by a 200-ms-lasting flash. The histogram shows a significantly shorter duration for
compound EPSCs (normalized to flash duration) as compared to IPSCs. E: Examples of lightinduced post-synaptic currents recorded at two different holding potentials (Vh) in plain ACSF. At Vh
= -40mV the GABAergic component of the PSC was visible as an outward current (white
arrowhead). The black arrowhead marks an inward EPSC. F: individual EPSC and IPSC recorded in
response to brief flashes (5ms) in the presence of GBZ and NBQX, respectively (Vh = -80 mV). The
box plots summarize decay time constants and latencies for individual EPSCs and IPSCs. G:
representative gel of single-cell RT-PCR analysis showing mRNA expression of Slc32a1, Sst,
Slc17a7, Slc17a6, Slc17a8, Eomes (an embryonic gene not expressed in the adult, used as a
negative control) and 18S (a housekeeping gene as positive control). An expression pattern
example for each of the following cell types is shown: striatal somatostatin-expressing interneuron
(SST-IN Str), striatal spiny projection neuron (SPN Str), striatal cholinergic interneuron (Chol Str),
cortical principal cell (PC Ctx). PCR performed on mRNA extract from adult forebrain tissue (FB)
and blank reaction (H2O) are also shown as positive and negative controls, respectively. The
asterisk indicates a non-specific PCR band.

To confirm the presumed co-transmission of the two different neurotransmitters and
identify its molecular basis, we performed semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) in cytoplasmic samples of identified individual cells collected through the
recording pipette. SST-INs consistently expressed Sst (the gene encoding for
somatostatin; 10 out of 10 cells; Figure 1G). In a subset of SST-INs (3 out of 10 cells) we
detected co-expression of both GABA and glutamate vesicular transporters, VGAT
(Slc32a1) and VGLUT1 (Slc17a7), respectively (Figure 1G, Supplementary Figure S1).
Conversely, striatal SPNs expressed VGAT but not VGLUT (3 out of 3 cells), while cortical
principal cells (PCs) expressed VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 (Slc17a6), but not VGAT (3 out of 3
cells). SST-INs neither expressed VGLUT2 (0 out 10 cells) nor VGLUT3 (Slc17a8; 0 out of

13

10 cells). One striatal cholinergic interneuron was positive for VGLUT3 (1 out of 1 cell),
consistently with previous findings (Fremeau et al., 2002; Gras et al., 2002; Nelson et al.,
2014).
These data suggest that, at least in a subset of striatal SST-INs, GABA/glutamate cotransmission is supported by the concomitant expression of vesicular transporters VGAT
and VGLUT1, respectively.

GABA/glutamate co-transmission is age-dependent.
The probability to detect SST-IN-mediated release of glutamate was much higher in
relatively older than younger mice. We recorded compound EPSCs (in the presence of
GBZ) in 18 out of 20 SPNs (90%) from 8 mice aged 45 to 90 days. Conversely, in 7
younger animals (p30-p44) EPSCs were only detected in 15 out of 27 SPNs (56%,
p=0.028, Z-test for two population proportions; Figure 2A). In addition, the median EPSC
amplitude in responding SPNs was significantly larger in older than younger mice (-81 pA
vs. -17 pA, respectively, n = 18 and 15, p=0.003, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test; Figure
2A).
Similarly, compound IPSCs (in the presence of NBQX) were found in 30 out of 31 SPNs
(97%) from 8 older mice (p45-p90) and in 17 out of 28 SPNs (61%) from 3 younger mice
(p30-p44; p=0.002, Z-test for two population proportions; Figure 2B). The median IPSC
amplitude was also larger in the older group, though the difference was not statistically
significant (-85 pA vs. -60 pA, respectively, n = 30 and 18, p=0.57, Mann-Whitney Rank
Sum Test; Figure 2B).
Thus, both glutamate and GABA release by SST-INs become progressively more robust
well into the adult age in mice.

SST-IN photoactivation promotes a transient excitation followed by robust inhibition of
SPN firing activity.
The SST-IN-mediated dual synaptic response described above might unconventionally
affect the firing activity of postsynaptic SPNs. To assess this, we recorded trains of action
potentials induced by steady, suprathreshold DC injection (200-300 pA) in individual SPNs
in current-clamp configuration. Once a stable firing activity was reached, we delivered blue
light flashes (2-4 s) which consistently caused a transient increase in AP frequency lasting
100-300ms, followed by a more prolonged inhibition that persisted up to the flash offset
(Figure 3A). The cell would then gradually recover to its baseline frequency. Mean
frequency values measured during light delivery were significantly different from pre- and
post-flash ones (pre-flash: 6 ± 0.8 Hz, early flash increase: 17 ± 4 Hz, late flash decrease:
2 ± 1 Hz, post-flash: 6 ± 1 Hz, n = 7, p<0.05, one-way ANOVA; Figure 3B). Similar results
were obtained when flashes were delivered over a higher baseline frequency induced by
larger DC injection (300-400 pA; ctrl: 18 ± 5 Hz, early flash increase: 44 ± 9 Hz, late flash
decrease: 11 ± 5 Hz, post-flash: 16 ± 4 Hz, n = 5, p<0.05, one-way ANOVA; Figure 3B).
These results suggest that co-transmission of glutamate and GABA during SST-IN
stimulation induce a fast, transient excitatory effect followed by a slower inhibition of firing
activity in striatal postsynaptic SPNs.

(200-300 pA) was injected to induce action potentials at different frequencies (left and right panels,

GABA/glutamate co-transmission also occurs in striatal SST-IN synapses targeting fastspiking interneurons.
A similar pattern of synaptic response was detected in fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs,
another major class of striatal cells) in response to SST-IN photostimulation (Figure 4).
Control compound currents induced by blue light flashes (0.5-1s) were only partially
reduced by 10M GBZ (ctrl: -220 ± 84 pA, GBZ: -78 ± 19 pA, respectively, n = 6, p = 0.11,
paired t test), the residual current being completely blocked by 5M NBQX. Individual
EPSCs had faster kinetics than IPSCs (dec: 1.5 ± 0.2 ms vs. 6.4 ± 0.7 ms, respectively, n
= 6, p<0.05, unpaired t test; Figure 4B), while their latencies from pulse onset were
comparable (9.0 ± 1.9 ms vs. 8.3 ± 0.9 ms, n = 6, p>0.05, unpaired t test; Figure 4B).
Similarly to what we observed in SPNs, photoactivation of SST-INs induced a transient
increase in FSI AP frequency followed by a slowdown that often persisted throughout the
pulse delivery (pre-flash: 56 ± 14 Hz, early increase: 94 ± 14 Hz, late decrease: 32 ± 10
Hz, post-flash: 42 ± 11 Hz, n = 4, p<0.05, one-way ANOVA; Figure 4C). Thus, striatal
SST-INs also project GABA/glutamate co-releasing synapses onto FSIs, exerting a fast
excitatory-inhibitory sequence similar to that observed in postsynaptic SPNs.

restored to a value similar to that prior to light onset.

19

Presynaptic FSIs only release GABA onto SPNs.
We asked whether striatal FSIs may be able to co-release glutamate and GABA in a
similar manner as that seen for presynaptic SST-INs. Using slices obtained from
transgenic mice expressing ChR2 in FSIs, we delivered blue light flashes over the striatum
in order to specifically excite FSIs while patching postsynaptic SPNs in voltage-clamp
mode at Vh = -80 mV (Figure 5). Differently from SST-INs, FSIs exclusively elicited
GABAergic IPSCs as perfusion with 10M GBZ left no detectable current (peak amplitude,
ctrl: -466 ± 145 pA, GBZ: -2 ± 2 pA, n = 6, p<0.05, paired t test, Figure 5A). Accordingly,
during FSI photoactivation we observed a purely inhibitory effect on SPN firing activity,
with no sign of the transient excitation that was consistently recorded during SST-IN
stimulation (pre-flash: 8.7 ± 1.6 Hz, during flash: 1.7 ± 1.1 Hz, post-flash: 7.0 ± 1.6 Hz, n =
6, p<0.05, one-way ANOVA; Figure 5B). Thus, of these two major classes of striatal
GABAergic interneurons only SST-INs are capable to co-release glutamate and GABA
onto SPNs.

photostimulation. The inset on top shows an example trace recorded in a FSI firing a train of APs

extracellular perfusion with 10µM GBZ was sufficient to completely block the compound PSC.
Summary box plots with median peak currents before and after GBZ are shown on the right. B:
current clamp recording of firing activity induced by injection of a step current (250 pA, 3s) in the

purely inhibitory role of FSI GABAergic synapses with no evidence for excitation mediated by
glutamate co-release. The box plot on the right summarizes the effect of FSI activation on SPN
firing frequency.

21

Cortical SST-INs are exclusively GABAergic.
To assess whether striatal SST-INs share their ability of co-releasing GABA and
glutamate with their analog cells residing in cortical areas, we recorded synaptic currents
in cortical principal cells (PCs) in response to local photostimulation of SST-INs (Figure 6).
In this configuration, only GABAergic, GBZ-sensitive currents were detected (ctrl: -54 ± 13
pA, GBZ: 0 ± 0 pA, n = 5, p<0.05, paired t test; Figure 6A,B). Consequently, a strong
inhibition of firing activity was the only evident effect in current-clamp recordings (pre-flash:
4.5 ± 1.0 Hz, during flash: 0.9 ± 0.3 Hz, n = 5, p<0.05, paired t test; Figure 6C,D). Similar
results were obtained when recording CA1 neurons during photostimulation of
hippocampal oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) SST-INs (not shown).

stimulation. C: top, firing activity evoked by injection of a current step (+200 pA, 500ms) in a

23

GABA/glutamate co-transmission is not mediated by synaptic projections from extrastriatal areas.
Finally, we found no synaptic response (either GABA- or glutamatergic) in striatal SPNs
during flash stimulation of SST-INs in various cortical, pallidal, or thalamic regions (Figure
7). We did not detect the recently reported IPSCs mediated by long-range cortico-striatal
SST-INs (Melzer et al., 2017) likely because these projections preferentially target the
ventro-lateral striatum, while we concentrated our recordings in the dorsal aspects of the
region. We occasionally found IPSCs evoked by photostimulation of lateral cortical areas
(e.g. auditory; not shown), though these responses were only GABAergic, consistently with
a study by (Rock et al., 2016). Thus, our data suggest that (1) only intrastriatal SST-INs
are able to co-release GABA and glutamate onto local postsynaptic targets, while their
cortical and hippocampal counterparts are exclusively GABAergic, and (2)
GABA/glutamate co-transmission is likely not exerted by synaptic terminals originating
from extra-striatal cells located in striatally-projecting regions.

Discussion
We report a mechanism of simultaneous co-transmission of GABA and glutamate
exerted by SST-INs in the striatum–but not in cortex or hippocampus–targeting
postsynaptic SPNs and FSIs. The different dynamic properties of action of the two
neurotransmitters resulted in a consistent pattern of postsynaptic electrical activity
perturbation, i.e. a transient excitation followed by a prolonged inhibition of action potential
firing. Co-transmission of glutamate and GABA was supported by concomitant expression
of vesicular transporters VGLUT1 and VGAT in at least a subset of individual SST-INs.
Finally, GABA/glutamate co-transmission was consistently detected in relatively older mice
(aged over 45 days), but less so in younger animals.

Optical activation of SST-INs is reliable and specific.
In a first set of experiments we assessed the specificity of ChR2 expression in our
mice, in view of recent concerns regarding the use of transgenic lines resulting from
crossbreeding a “floxed” cre reporter line (Ai14, JAX 007908) and an SST-IRES-cre line
(JAX 013044) (Hu et al., 2013; Straub et al., 2016). In these studies, a reporter protein was
found expressed in sizeable fractions of non-SST-INs, raising questions about the
experimental reliability of the SST-IRES-cre mice. Here, we used a variant line (JAX
018973) re-derived on a different strain (C57BL/6NJ) from the parental one described in
the studies mentioned above (C57BL/6;129S4). We found no evidence for off-target ChR2
expression as none of the cells (including cortical PCs) displaying firing properties different
from those typical of SST-INs directly responded to light. In addition, we detected no
synaptic currents in striatal cells in response to photostimulation of a variety of extrastriatal areas (Figure 7). Thus, in these mice optically-activated GABA and glutamate corelease seems to be exclusively mediated by striatal SST-INs.

26

SST-IN selectively co-release GABA and glutamate.
An increasing number of studies have recently shown that individual neurons are able to
release both GABA and glutamate (Gutierrez, 2005; Root et al., 2014; Fattorini et al.,
2015; Ntamati and Luscher, 2016; Tritsch et al., 2016; Granger et al., 2017;
Hashimotodani et al., 2018; Root et al., 2018). Interestingly, synaptic terminals of pallidal
cells projecting to the lateral habenula (LHb) were recently found to co-release the two
neurotransmitters (Shabel et al., 2014; Meye et al., 2016). These terminals belong to
pallidal SST-INs expressing VGLUT2 and VGAT (Wallace et al., 2017). There is an
interesting analogy between these findings and our results in that SST-INs (but not other
cells in the respective areas) of these two major regions of the basal ganglia (striatum and
globus pallidus pars interna–or entopeduncular nucleus in rodents) appear to be a class of
interneurons specialized in GABA/glutamate co-release. On the other hand, striatal SSTINs appear to project their co-releasing synapses locally, while pallidal ones project out to
LHb. In addition, glutamate release is associated with VGLUT2 expression in pallidal SSTINs (Wallace et al., 2017) and VGLUT1 in striatal ones (our present results), suggesting a
different molecular signature for their co-transmission ability and/or heterogeneity in their
embryonic origin.

Do all SST-INs co-release GABA and glutamate?
Our optogenetic experiments revealed GABA/glutamate co-transmission in response to
the majority of successful stimulations, probably because we delivered light flashes over a
relatively broad area to recruit as many SST-INs as possible. To assess the rate of
individual co-releasing cells we tried to record cell pairs made of one SST-IN and one SPN
(or FSI), but failed to find any functional connectivity at all in 18 different pairs –likely due
to the relatively long distance between connected pairs of this kind, which drastically

27

lowers the probability to find them using paired recordings (conversely, in a different
ongoing study we recorded closely connected FSI-SPN pairs with a high success rate–26
out 30, 87%). Therefore, our experiments do not directly answer the question whether a
selected fraction vs. all of SST-INs are capable of co-releasing GABA and glutamate. In
rtPCR analysis, co-expression of VGLUT1 and VGAT mRNA was found in 30% of our
collected cytoplasmic samples, suggesting that co-transmission involves only a subset of
SST-INs. However, although we performed control analyses that were useful to validate
our results (e.g., all SST-INs expressing somatostatin, cortical principal cells expressing
VGLUT but not VGAT, SPNs expressing VGAT but not VGLUT, and cholinergic
interneurons expressing VGLUT3), our findings are based on a relatively small sample
size, and it remains possible that some mRNA expression is under the detection threshold
with our technique. It seems therefore premature to conclude that SST-INs should be
subdivided into VGLUT+ vs. VGLUT- subgroups. Thus, while providing an unequivocal
evidence for the expression of VGLUT1 in some SST-INs, our molecular findings are to be
as yet considered a proof of principle for what concerns a quantitative estimation.

Physiological relevance and further considerations.
What is the physiological meaning of simultaneous GABA and glutamate transmission?
Concurrent expression of one major neurotransmitter and one or more neuromodulators
(such as amines or peptides) is very common in the central nervous system, but cotransmission of GABA and glutamate–which normally exert opposite and counterbalanced
effects through dedicated cell types–may seem puzzling at a first glance. However, the
different kinetics of the two neurotransmitter described here (rapidly depressing AMPAmediated EPSCs vs. persisting GABAergic IPSCs) are consistently reflected in the
unambiguous firing response made of a brief excitation followed by a longer inhibition in
postsynaptic cells. To some extent these properties recall the effects of classic feed-

28

forward inhibition (FFI, typically exerted by dedicated interneurons and their GABAergic
output shaping temporal dynamics of synaptic excitation provided by glutamatergic
afferents (Buzsaki, 1984)), but using a different circuit configuration (Supplementary Figure
S2). Striatal SST-INs appear to enclose both components of FFI thanks to the different
short-term dynamics of EPSCs and IPSCs. The result is a sharp, temporally contained
increase in postsynaptic firing frequency similar to classic FFI (Isaacson and Scanziani,
2011). Interestingly, these properties consolidate as the animal progresses into young
adulthood, which may correlate with the acquisition of new skills, flexibility, or cognitive
functions. The timing of SPN firing is associated with movement initiation, execution, or
termination (Schultz and Romo, 1988; Cui et al., 2013; Jin et al., 2014), thus its fine
regulation mediated by interneurons is of critical importance (Gernert et al., 2000; Gage et
al., 2010). SST-INs and FSIs respond differently to cortical input due to dissimilarities in
both pre- and postsynaptic elements (e.g., release probability, composition of AMPA
receptors, presence vs. absence of NMDA receptors, and input resistance) (Gittis et al.,
2010). This adds up to their different firing patterns, synaptic spatial distributions
(perisomatic vs. dendritic contacts), and configuration of synaptic functions (GABAmediated FFI vs. GABA/glutamate co-transmission). Altogether, these properties most
likely provide a crucial contribution to the diversification and coordination of neuronal
microcircuits and to a fine modulation of the striatal functional output.
An important issue that remains to be clarified is whether glutamate and GABA are
released by the same or different vesicle pools, and whether these pools reside in the
same or different presynaptic boutons (Zander et al., 2010; Tritsch et al., 2016). Although
we did not investigate the microanatomy of these hybrid synapses, the differences in
EPSC vs. IPSC short-term plasticity may in principle suggest the recruitment of separated
pools of vesicles undergoing different release dynamics. It is alternatively possible,
however, that the two neurotransmitters are co-packaged in the same vesicles, but in

29

different quantities. A lower amount of glutamate molecules per vesicle would result in a
quickly exhausted action at the postsynaptic side, though different availability/saturation of
postsynaptic GABAergic and glutamatergic receptors and/or different neurotransmitter
clearance from the synaptic cleft may also play a role. Further work employing electron
microscopy and pharmacologic approaches will help answer these questions.
Finally, the interplay of GABA and glutamate transmission at co-releasing synapses
may well be subject to a variety of physiological regulatory mechanisms in health –and
anomalous functioning in disease. Interestingly, in pallido-habenular, co-releasing
projections a shifted balance of the two neurotransmitters is associated with severely
altered behavioral states such as depression (Shabel et al., 2014) and cocaine relapse
(Meye et al., 2016). In the future it will be interesting to investigate if changes in the
GABA/glutamate equilibrium at striatal SST-IN synapses similarly generate pathological
abnormalities.
