ABSTRACT

2

Mutations in the transcription factor GATA2 cause lymphedema. GATA2 is necessary for the

3

development of lymphatic valves (LVs) and lymphovenous valves (LVVs), and for the

4

patterning of lymphatic vessels. Here, we report that GATA2 is not necessary for valvular

5

endothelial cell (VEC) differentiation. Instead, GATA2 is required for VEC maintenance and

6

morphogenesis. GATA2 is also necessary for the expression of cell junction molecules VE-

7

Cadherin and Claudin5 in lymphatic vessels. We identified miR-126 as a target of GATA2, and

8

miR-126-/- embryos recapitulate the phenotypes of mice lacking GATA2. Primary human

9

lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs) lacking GATA2 (GATA2ΔHLEC) have altered expression of

10

Claudin5 and VE-Cadherin, and blocking miR-126 activity in HLECs phenocopies these

11

changes in expression. Importantly, overexpression of miR-126 in GATA2ΔHLEC significantly

12

rescues the cell junction defects. Thus, our work defines a new mechanism of GATA2 and

13

uncovers miR-126 as a novel regulator of mammalian lymphatic vascular development.

INTRODUCTION

2

The lymphatic vasculature is a hierarchically organized tissue that absorbs and returns

3

extravasated plasma fluids and digested lipids to the blood circulation (Tammela and Alitalo

4

2010; Chen et al. 2014). This fluid, commonly known as lymph, is absorbed by lymphatic

5

capillaries and transported via collecting lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic valves (LVs) within the

6

lymphatic vessels regulate the unidirectional flow of lymph. Finally, lymph is returned to the

7

blood circulation at the junction of jugular and subclavian veins through four lymphovenous

8

valves (LVVs).

9

Mutations in multiple genes are associated with lymphedema, a debilitating disease

10

characterized by the swelling of tissues, most obviously the limbs (Brouillard et al. 2014). Other

11

lymphatic anomalies include chylous ascites (fluid in the peritoneal cavity), chylothorax (fluid

12

around the lungs) or lymph reflex. These lymphatic vascular dysfunctions could arise from

13

anatomical defects in the vessels or valves, though in most cases the precise cause is unclear.

14

Heterozygous mutations in the zinc finger transcription factor GATA2 are associated

15

with an array of hematopoietic disorders and lymphedema (Spinner et al. 2014). The

16

overlapping phenotypes of this disease include immune deficiency, myelodysplasia (MDS),

17

acute myeloid leukemia (AML), predisposition to mycobacterial infections and warts, hearing

18

loss and lymphedema (Spinner et al. 2014; Crispino and Horwitz 2017). Emberger syndrome,

19

caused by mutations in GATA2, is classified as deafness and primary lymphedema with

20

MDS/AML (Emberger et al. 1979; Ostergaard et al. 2011; Kazenwadel et al. 2012).

21

Approximately 11-30% of people with mutated GATA2 develop lymphedema (Ostergaard et al.

22

2011; Kazenwadel et al. 2012; Spinner et al. 2014; Donadieu et al. 2018). Donadieu et al.

23

noted that patients with GATA2 mutations tend to develop lymphedema early, in the first

24

decade of life. In summary, early-onset lymphedema with incomplete penetrance is associated

25

with GATA2-heterozygous mutations. We need better insight into the molecular mechanisms

of GATA2 activity to understand the causes of lymphedema in Emberger syndrome patients.

2

Mouse models have revealed that GATA2 is critical for the development of a variety of

3

cell types including hematopoietic cells, neurons, pituitary glands, urinogenital system and the

4

endothelium (Zhou et al. 1998; Zhou et al. 2000; Craven et al. 2004; Charles et al. 2006;

5

Khandekar et al. 2007; Lim et al. 2012). Gata2-/- mice die at embryonic day (E)10 just as

6

lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are starting to be specified. Conditional deletion of Gata2

7

from all endothelial cells during mouse development results in severely edematous embryos

8

with small blood-filled lymph sacs (Lim et al. 2012; Frye et al. 2018). Conditional deletion of

9

Gata2 in LECs results in mispatterned dermal lymphatic vessels, and a loss of lymphatic

10

valves (LVs) (Kazenwadel et al. 2015; Frye et al. 2018). In addition, E12.5 or older embryos

11

with a conditional deletion of GATA2 in all endothelial cells or LECs lack LVVs (Kazenwadel et

12

al. 2015; Geng et al. 2016; Frye et al. 2018). Thus, GATA2 is essential for proper development

13

of the lymphatic vasculature.

14

In vitro experiments have revealed several molecular functions of GATA2. A stiff extra

15

cellular matrix (ECM) triggers GATA2-dependent activation of VEGFR2 expression in blood

16

endothelial cells (Mammoto et al. 2009). In contrast, a soft-ECM enhances GATA2 expression

17

in primary human LECs (HLECs) and, in turn, induction of VEGFR3 (Frye et al. 2018). This

18

mechanistic relationship has been proposed to be critical for LEC migration from the cardinal

19

vein and could explain the small lymph sacs in mice lacking GATA2 in all endothelial cells.

20

Oscillatory shear stress (OSS), Wnt/β-catenin signaling and PROX1 are thought to be

21

the most-upstream regulators of LV and LVV formation, all of which activate GATA2

22

expression in HLECs (Kazenwadel et al. 2015; Sweet et al. 2015; Cha et al. 2016; Cha et al.

23

2018). OSS-induced GATA2 expression in HLECs is dependent on histone deacetylase 3

24

(HDAC3) (Janardhan et al. 2017). In turn, GATA2 is necessary for OSS-induced expression of

FOXC2 and Connexin 37 (Kazenwadel et al. 2015; Sweet et al. 2015). Furthermore, GATA2

2

directly associates with the regulatory elements of PROX1 in HLECs, and GATA2 knockdown

3

in HLECs downregulates the expression of PROX1 (Kazenwadel et al. 2015).

4

The current model built on these observations proposes that GATA2 regulates the

5

differentiation of valvular endothelial cells from progenitors by upregulating PROX1, FOXC2

6

and Connexin 37 in those cells. However, whether this model is accurate in vivo remains

7

unclear. Although LVV forming endothelial cells (LVV-ECs) differentiate at E12.0 with the

8

upregulation of PROX1, FOXC2, Connexin 37 and GATA2 in those cells (Geng et al. 2016),

9

whether GATA2 is necessary for LVV-EC differentiation is not known.

RESULTS

2

GATA2 is necessary for the proper architecture of newly differentiated LVV-ECs

3

Previous reports including ours have used pan-endothelial Cre lines for deleting Gata2

4

(Kazenwadel et al. 2015; Geng et al. 2016; Frye et al. 2018). Gata2 has also been deleted in

5

the lymphatic vasculature in a mosaic manner using tamoxifen-inducible Cre lines

6

(Kazenwadel et al. 2015; Frye et al. 2018). Here, we used Lyve1-Cre (Pham et al. 2010) to

7

obtain uniform, constitutive deletion of Gata2 (Charles et al. 2006) in the lymphatic

8

vasculature. As anticipated Lyve1-Cre;Gata2f/f (Gata2LECKO) embryos recapitulated the

9

previously reported lymphatic vascular phenotypes. Specifically, E16.5 Gata2LECKO embryos

10

possessed blood-filled lymphatic vessels, which were dilated and had fewer branch points. The

11

mutant embryos also lacked LVs and LVVs (Figure 1 and data not shown).

12

To investigate a potential role for GATA2 in LVV-EC differentiation, we used numerous

13

LVV-EC markers (PROX1high, FOXC2high, Connexin37 (GJA4), integrin-α5, integrin-α9) to

14

analyze E12.0 embryos (Figure 2A, B and Figure 2- Figure Supplement 1A-H). LVV-EC

15

numbers were not significantly different between control and Gata2LECKO embryos littermates

16

at this stage (Figure 2C). We also analyzed E12.0 Tie2-Cre;Gata2f/f embryos in which Gata2

17

is deleted from all endothelial cells at a much earlier time point (Kisanuki et al. 2001). E12.0

18

Tie2-Cre;Gata2f/f embryos had LVV-ECs (Figure 2- Figure Supplement 2), excluding the

19

possibility that the LVV-ECs observed in Gata2LECKO embryos is due to inefficient deletion of

20

Gata2 by Lyve1-Cre. Thus, LVV-EC differentiation is normal in Gata2LECKO mutants.

21

To examine LVV-ECs further, we used correlative fluorescent microscopy followed by

22

scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to visualize the developing LVV-ECs at high resolution

23

(Geng et al. 2016). First, we analyzed sagittal sections along the cardinal vein of E12.0

24

Tg(Prox1-tdTomato) embryos by confocal microscopy (Gong et al. 2003). We observed

25

tdTomatohigh LVV-ECs in both control and Gata2LECKO backgrounds (Figure 2D, E). SEM on

these same samples revealed individual LVV-ECs that are elongated and aligned

2

perpendicular to the direction of blood flow in control E12.0 embryos (Figure 2D’’, pseudo

3

colored in green). The rest of the venous endothelium was quiescent with cobblestone-like

4

appearance. In contrast, SEM revealed that the LVV-ECs in E12.0 Tg(Prox1-tdTomato);

5

Gata2LECKO embryos are round and not aligned perpendicular to blood flow (Figure 2- Figure

6

Supplement 3). In addition, LVV-ECs also appear dysplastic in E12.0 Tg(Prox1-tdTomato);

7

Gata2LECKO embryos (Figure 2E’’, pseudo colored in green, and Figure 2- Figure

8

Supplement 3). Based on these observations we conclude that GATA2 is not necessary for

9

the differentiation of LVV-EC or for the upregulation of PROX1 or FOXC2 in those cells.

10

However, GATA2 is necessary for the proper architecture of the newly formed LVV-ECs.

11
12

GATA2 is necessary for the maintenance and morphogenesis of LVV-ECs

13

By E12.5, control embryos displayed LVV-ECs in the venous walls and two-well formed LVVs

14

(Figure 3A, arrows). In contrast, E12.5 Gata2LECKO embryos had very few LVV-ECs in the

15

venous walls and lacked clearly defined LVVs (Figure 3B, arrow). In addition, E12.5 Tg(Prox1-

16

tdTomato) control embryos exhibited two tightly aggregated clusters of tdTomatohigh LVV-ECs

17

(Figure 3C, arrows), and SEM of one these clusters revealed elongated LVV-ECs that formed

18

an opening in the middle (LVV) to permit lymph return to the blood circulation (Figure 3C’’,

19

arrowhead). In contrast, Tg(Prox1-tdTomato);Gata2LECKO embryos lacked tdTomatohigh LVV-

20

ECs (Figure 3D), and SEM of the LVV-forming region revealed a smooth luminal surface,

21

devoid of LVVs (Figure 3D’’).

22

Fluorescent reporter proteins such as tdTomato have a long half-life and can remain

23

within cells for several days after the reporter gene is shut off (Muzumdar et al. 2007).

24

However, tdTomatohigh LVV-ECs in Tg(Prox1-tdTomato);Gata2LECKO embryos disappear within

25

12 hrs (between E12.0 to E12.5), suggesting that LVV-ECs were eliminated either by cell

death or by detachment and removal via the bloodstream. To verify the loss of LVV-ECs, we

2

performed lineage tracing. We generated Prox1-CreERT2;R26+/tdTomato embryos in a control

3

(wild-type) and Gata2f/f background, treated pregnant dams with tamoxifen at E10.5, and

4

evaluated embryos at E15.5. R26+/tdTomato allowed us to lineage trace the PROX1+ cells (LECs

5

and LVV-ECs). Whereas entire LVVs were tdTomato+ in control embryos (Figure 3E, arrows),

6

LVVs were absent in Prox1-CreERT2;Gata2f/f;R26+/tdTomato embryos (Figure 3F). Importantly,

7

the LVV-forming area of Prox1-CreERT2;Gata2f/f;R26+/tdTomato embryos had very few labeled

8

cells (Figure 3F), consistent with a loss of LVV-ECs in embryos lacking Gata2.

9

LVV-ECs in E12.0 or E12.5 control embryos did not express the proliferation marker

10

phospho-histone 3 (PHH3) (data not shown), indicating that these cells do not proliferate.

11

Therefore, the lack of LVV-ECs in Gata2LECKO embryos does not reflect impaired proliferation.

12

We observed a few activated Casp3+ apoptotic cells within the lymph sacs of Gata2LECKO

13

embryos, but LVV-ECs did not appear to be labeled by this marker for apoptosis (data not

14

shown). Together these results indicate that GATA2 is not required for the differentiation of

15

LVV-ECs or for their survival or proliferation. We however cannot exclude the possibility of cell

16

death with the simultaneous detachment of LVV-ECs into the bloodstream.

17
18

In summary, GATA2 regulates the morphology of LVV-EC, maintains their presence in
the valve-forming region, and regulates their morphogenesis into LVVs.

19
20

GATA2 is not necessary for the upregulation of PROX1 and FOXC2 in VVs, LVs or AoVs

21

GATA2 is also expressed in LVs, venous valves (VVs) and aortic valves (AoVs) (Kazenwadel

22

et al and data not shown) (Kazenwadel et al. 2015). Hence, we tested whether GATA2 is

23

necessary for the differentiation of those valvular endothelial cells. VVs of the jugular vein exist

24

close to LVVs at E16.5. VV-forming endothelial cells (VV-ECs) differentiate at this region at

25

around E14.5. Control E15.5 embryos displayed LVVs (Figure 4A, arrows) and developing

VVs invaginating into the veins (Figure 4A, arrowheads). In contrast, Gata2LECKO E15.5

2

embryos lacked LVVs, and PROX1high VV-ECs were not invaginating into the veins (Figure

3

4B, arrowheads). Expression of FOXC2 is also unaffected in the VV-ECs of Gata2LECKO

4

embryos (data not shown). Thus, GATA2 is not necessary for the differentiation of VV-ECs.

5

We deleted Gata2 using Prox1+/Cre to remove GATA2 from the PROX1+ aortic valve

6

endothelial cells (AoV-ECs) (Srinivasan et al. 2010). PROX1 and Prox1+/Cre are expressed in

7

AoV-ECs as early as E12.5 (data not shown). As shown in Figure 4C, D, expression of

8

PROX1 and FOXC2 was unaffected in the AoV-ECs of E14.5 Prox1+/Cre;Gata2f/f embryos. We

9

also did not observe any obvious differences in the expression of PROX1 and FOXC2 in E16.5

10

Prox1+/Cre;Gata2f/f embryos (data not shown). Thus, GATA2 is not required to upregulate

11

PROX1 and FOXC2 in AoV-ECs or to maintain these cells.

12

We noticed that in contrast to Gata2LECKO embryos Prox1-CreERT2;Gata2f/f embryos do

13

not develop blood-filled lymphatic vessels even though they lack LVVs (Figure 3F). Blood-

14

filled lymphatic vessels could affect LV development (Sweet et al. 2015). Therefore, we

15

analyzed Prox1-CreERT2;Gata2f/f embryos to investigate the role of GATA2 in LV

16

development. We exposed pregnant dams carrying Prox1-CreERT2;Gata2f/f embryos to

17

tamoxifen at E14.5 and harvested the embryos at E16.5. Analysis of the skin and mesenteric

18

lymphatic vessels revealed that LV-EC clusters were present in both control and mutant

19

embryos, although those numbers were reduced in the mutants (Figure 4E-J). In contrast,

20

E18.5 Prox1-CreERT2;Gata2f/f embryos that were exposed to tamoxifen at E14.5 completely

21

lacked LVs (data not shown). Hence, these results suggest that GATA2 is not necessary for

22

the differentiation of LV-ECs, but it is necessary to maintain those cells.

23

Together, these results indicate that GATA2 is not necessary for the differentiation of

24

LVV-ECs, VV-ECs, LV-ECs or AoV-ECs or for the upregulation of PROX1 and FOXC2 in those

25

cells. However, GATA2 is necessary to maintain vascular valve endothelial cells (LVV-ECs

EGFL7 and ANGPT2 are regulated by GATA2 in HLECs

4

To identify potential genes regulated by GATA2 in vivo, we examined GATA2-dependent gene

5

expression in HLECs. We treated HLECs with lentiviral particles expressing shGFP or

6

shGATA2, harvested them 72 hrs later and performed RNA-seq. We performed this

7

experiment in triplicate, and Principle Component Analysis confirmed the consistency in gene

8

expression changes among the triplicates (Figure 5A). We pursued genes whose expression

9

is significantly (p<0.05) different between shGFP- and shGATA2-treated HLECs, with Log2 fold

10

change (FC) >0.5 or Log2 FC<-0.5. According to these criteria, 1009 genes were significantly

11

downregulated and 617 genes were significantly upregulated upon depletion of GATA2 in

12

HLECs (Figure 5B and Supplementary File 1). GATA2 was dramatically downregulated (Log2

13

FC = -2.08) in shGATA2-treated HLECs, as expected (Supplementary File 1). We did not

14

observe significant changes in the expression of PROX1, FOXC2 or FLT4. However, a number

15

of other genes that regulate vascular development were differentially expressed in shGATA2-

16

treated HLECs (Figure 5C).

17

Among the top 50 most down regulated genes only GATA2, Angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2)

18

and EGF-like domain-containing protein 7 (EGFL7) are reported to be necessary for embryonic

19

survival and vascular development (http://www.informatics.jax.org). EGFL7 (NM_201446) is a

20

secreted protein that was first reported as a regulator of vascular lumen formation (Parker et

21

al. 2004). EGFL7 also regulates blood endothelial cell migration, contractility and adhesion

22

(Charpentier et al. 2013). EGFL7 is also the host gene for miR-126, which is the first

23

endothelial cell-specific microRNA to be reported (Lagos-Quintana et al. 2002). Interestingly,

24

EGFL7 is not required for the survival of mice as long as miR-126 is intact (Kuhnert et al.

25

2008). In contrast, most miR-126-/- embryos die in utero with severe edema (Kuhnert et al.

2008; Wang et al. 2008). Importantly, GATA2 was recently reported to regulate EGFL7 and

2

miR-126 in blood vascular endothelial cells (Hartmann et al. 2016). However, the lymphatic

3

vasculature specific roles of miR-126 remain unknown.

4

ANGPT2 is a secreted molecule and a ligand of TIE2 (also known as TEK). In blood

5

endothelial cells, ANGPT2 is an antagonist of TIE2. The TIE2/ANGPT2 interaction in blood

6

endothelial cells results in VE-PTP-mediated downregulation of VE-Cadherin (Souma et al.

7

2018). In contrast, in LECs ANGPT2 is an agonist of TIE2 due to the absence of VE-PTP.

8

Deletion of Angpt2 results in a strain-specific postnatal lethality in mice due to severe

9

chylothorax (Gale et al. 2002; Dellinger et al. 2008). Angpt2-/- mice lack LVs and have

10
11

defective cell junctions. Whether ANGPT2 is necessary for LVV development is unknown.
To validate whether ANGPT2 and EGFL7 are GATA2 targets, we used CRISPR/Cas9

12

to generate GATA2 knockout in a distinct HLEC cell line (HLEC-2). Western blotting and DNA

13

sequencing confirmed the deletion of GATA2 in GATA2ΔHLEC (Figure 5D and Figure 5- Figure

14

Supplement 1). Importantly, the protein levels of both EGFL7 and ANGPT2 were reduced in

15

GATA2ΔHLEC cells compared to controls, whereas PROX1 was unaffected (Figure 5D). In

16

addition, after extracting miRNA’s from the cells we determined by qRT-PCR that miR-126 is

17

significantly downregulated in GATA2ΔHLEC cells compared to controls (Figure 5D).

In summary, EGFL7, miR-126 and ANGPT2 are consistently downregulated by the
knockdown or knockout of GATA2 in HLECs.

20
21

MiR-126 is a physiologically important target of GATA2 in the lymphatic vasculature

22

To investigate the physiological relevance of these candidate GATA2 target genes, we

23

compared their expression in the LVV-ECs of E12.0 control and Gata2LECKO embryos.

24

ANGPT2 was not expressed in LVV-ECs at E12.0 although it appears at E14.5 (Figure 6).

1

Angpt2-/- embryos lacked LVs and had defective lymphatic vessel patterning as reported

2

previously (data not shown) (Gale et al. 2002; Dellinger et al. 2008). However, Angpt2-/-

3

embryos retained normal looking LVVs and VVs (Figure 6). These observations suggested

4

that GATA2-dependent regulation of Angpt2 is not involved in LVV and VV development.

5

Hence, we focused our attention on miR-126 for the rest of this work.

6

In situ hybridization revealed high expression of miR-126 in LVV-ECs of E12.0 control

7

embryos but not Gata2LECKO embryos (Figure 7A, B, arrows). Similarly, E18.5 control embryos

8

expressed EGFL7 in the LECs of mesenteric lymphatic vessels and in LVs (Figure 7C, arrow),

9

whereas EGFL7 expression was dramatically reduced in the LECs of E18.5 Prox1-

10

CreERT2;Gata2f/f embryos in which Gata2 deletion was induced by tamoxifen injection at

11

E14.5 (Figure 7D). As mentioned previously, the mutants lacked LVs. Thus, GATA2 is

12

required for EGFL7/miR-126 expression in the developing lymphatic vasculature.

13

GATA2 associates with the promoter of EGFL7/miR-126 in human umbilical vein

14

endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Hartmann et al. 2016). We performed chromatin

15

immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-GATA2 antibody and determined that GATA2

16

associates with this promoter region in HLECs as well (Figure 7E). These results suggest that

17

EGFL7/miR-126 is a direct target of GATA2 in the lymphatic vasculature.

18

As mentioned previously Egfl7-/- mice that retain miR-126 are phenotypically normal

19

(Kuhnert et al. 2008). Therefore, we analyzed miR-126-/- embryos, which display severe edema

20

(Wang et al. 2008). LVVs and VVs were absent in the jugulo-subclavian vein junction of E16.5

21

miR-126-/- embryos compared to wild type (Figure 8A, B). LVV-ECs were present in E12.0

22

miR-126-/- embryos (Figure 8C, D), indicating that miR-126 is not necessary for the

23

differentiation of LVV-ECs, but for their maintenance. MiR-126-/- embryos had dilated

24

mesenteric lymphatic vessels that lack LVs (Figure 8E, F), and the lymphatic vessels in the

25

dorsal skin are hypoplastic (Figure 8G, H).

Overall, these observations demonstrate that GATA2 regulates miR-126 both in vitro

2

and in vivo. Furthermore, a significant level of phenotypic similarity between Gata2LECKO and

3

miR-126-/- embryos, including defects in the maintenance of LVVs and lymphatic vessel

4

patterning indicate that miR-126 is likely a physiologically relevant target of GATA2 in the

5

lymphatic vasculature.

GATA2 regulates lymphatic endothelial cell junctions via miR-126

8

The Ras MAPK pathway inhibitor Sprouty related, EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (Spred1)

9

is a target of miR-126 in blood endothelial cells (Fish et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008), and

10

deletion of Spred1 rescues the blood vascular defects of miR-126-/- embryos (Wang et al.

11

2008; Zhou et al. 2016). To investigate a potential role for Spred1 in the lymphatic vasculature,

12

we examined Spred1 knockout embryos. miR-126-/- embryos displayed edema as anticipated

13

(Figure 9A, B). Spred1-/- embryos did not have edema or any obvious defects in LVVs or

14

lymphatic vessels (Figure 9C-H). Importantly, deletion of Spred1 did not rescue the lymphatic

15

vascular defects of miR-126-/- embryos (Figure 9C-H). Thus, miR-126 regulates lymphatic

16

vascular development independently of Spred1.

17

To identify the relevant targets of miR-126 we performed RNA-seq in HLECs expressing

18

an “miR-126 sponge” (Gentner et al. 2009; Lechman et al. 2012) to sequester miR-126 from its

19

endogenous targets (Supplementary File 1). Using the same criteria described above we

20

identified 1058 genes that were upregulated and 873 genes that were downregulated by miR-

21

126 sponge. SPRED1 and PIK3R2, which is another reported target of miR-126 in blood

22

endothelial cells, were not in the list (Fish et al. 2008). PROX1, FOXC2, FLT4 and GATA2

23

were also not found in this list. By comparing these genes with the GATA2 regulated genes we

24

identified 125 shared downregulated genes and 72 shared upregulated genes (data not

shown). DAVID gene annotation was used to classify the shared genes (Huang da et al.

2

2009a; Huang da et al. 2009b). Sixteen clusters were observed among the downregulated

3

genes with 42 membrane-associated proteins constituting the largest group. Nine clusters

4

were observed among upregulated genes, which included the keywords Membrane,

5

Cytoskeleton, Microtubule, Metalloprotease, Rap1 signaling and Cell junctions. All of the terms

6

identified among upregulated and downregulated genes are relevant to the regulation of

7

vascular integrity (Dudek and Garcia 2001; Chrzanowska-Wodnicka 2017). Therefore, we

8

analyzed the expression of cell junction molecules in Gata2LECKO and miR-126-/- embryos.

9

Claudin5 expression was dramatically downregulated in the lymphatic vessels of E16.5 miR-

10

126-/- embryos (Figure 10A, A’, B, B’’). Additionally, whereas VE-Cadherin was uniformly

11

expressed along the cell junctions of control embryos, it displayed discontinuous expression in

12

miR-126-/- embryos (Figure 10A’’, A’’’, B’’, B’’’). We identified identical defects in VE-

13

Cadherin and Claudin5 expression in E16.5 Gata2LECKO embryos (Figure 10C, D). In addition,

14

VE-Cadherin expression was disorganized in the mesenteric lymphatic vessels of E18.5

15

Prox1-CreERT2; Gata2f/f embryos that were exposed to tamoxifen at E14.5 (Figure 10E, F).

16

Thin sections of LVV-ECs from E12.0 control and Gata2LECKO embryos did not reveal

17

any obvious differences in VE-Cadherin or Claudin5 expression (Figure 2- Figure

18

Supplement 1M-P). However, LVV-ECs delaminate from the walls of veins at E12.0 before

19

reassembling in multiple layers to form mature LVVs at E12.5 (Geng et al. 2016). Such a rapid

20

morphogenesis of LVV-ECs is likely to involve dramatic reorganization of cell junctions. And,

21

the deletion of VE-Cadherin from the lymphatic vasculature was recently reported to prevent

22

the formation of LVs (Hagerling et al. 2018). Hence, we are tempted to speculate that a defect

23

in the reorganization of cell junctions might be the cause of LVV-EC disappearance in E12.5

24

Gata2LECKO embryos.

1

Given that the lymphatic vessels of E16.5 Gata2LECKO and miR-126-/- embryos had

2

defective cell junctions, we examined Claudin5 and VE-Cadherin expression in HLECs.

3

Claudin5 and VE-Cadherin were uniformly expressed around the entire periphery in ~80% of

4

control HLECs (Figure 11A, B). In contrast, the intensity of Claudin5 expression was

5

dramatically reduced in GATA2ΔHLEC cells (Figure 11C). In addition, the localization of VE-

6

Cadherin was defective in GATA2ΔHLEC cells with numerous gaps (Figure 11D, arrowheads).

7

To determine whether miR-126 also influences Claudin5 expression in HLECs, we

8

overexpressed the “miR-126 sponge” (Lechman et al. 2012) in HLECs, and observed a

9

significant reduction in Claudin5 expression and defective VE-Cadherin localization (Figure

10

11E-H). Thus, both GATA2 and miR-126 are regulators of Claudin5 expression and VE-

11

Cadherin localization in vitro and in vivo.

12

To determine whether GATA2 regulates Claudin5 via miR-126, we overexpressed miR-

13

126 in GATA2ΔHLEC cells using lentiviral particles (Amendola et al. 2009). We observed a

14

partial, yet significant rescue of Claudin5 expression in GATA2ΔHLEC expressing miR-126. In

15

addition, miR-126 significantly rescued the localization of VE-Cadherin at the cell junctions

16

(Figure 11I-G). These results suggest that GATA2 regulates adherens and tight junctions in

17

LECs through miR-126.

DISCUSSION

2

In this work, we have discovered that although GATA2 is not necessary for LVV-EC

3

differentiation, it is required for their maintenance. Further, GATA2 is important for LVV-ECs

4

and LECs to align appropriately with respect to the direction of fluid flow. GATA2 activates the

5

expression of miR-126 in LVV-ECs and LECs. The lymphatic vascular defects of mice lacking

6

GATA2 or miR-126 are strikingly similar, and both GATA2 and miR-126 are necessary for the

7

expression of cell junction molecules Claudin5 and VE-Cadherin. Importantly, miR-126 could

8

significantly rescue cell junction defects in HLECs lacking GATA2. Based on our results we

9

propose a model in which GATA2 regulates LVV morphogenesis and lymphatic vascular

10
11

maturation by maintaining proper cell junctions via miR-126 (Figure 12).
Valves normally develop at locations of disturbed flow. Hence, pioneering work by

12

Sabine et al. proposed OSS as the most upstream regulator of valve development (Sabine et

13

al. 2012). Significant advances have been made since this initial report. We showed that

14

Wnt/ß-catenin signaling enhances the expression of FOXC2 and GATA2 in response to OSS

15

(Cha et al. 2016), and that PROX1 is necessary for the activity of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling (Cha

16

et al. 2018). Elegant studies have shown that GATA2 enhances the expression of FOXC2 in

17

an OSS-dependent manner (Kazenwadel et al. 2015; Sweet et al. 2015). Despite this

18

knowledge, the precise role of OSS in valve development is unknown. Cytoskeleton, cell-cell

19

and cell-matrix interactions are critical regulators of mechanotransduction (Ingber 2006; Hahn

20

and Schwartz 2009). Therefore, our finding that GATA2 regulates VE-Cadherin and Claudin5

21

expression through miR-126 provides a mechanistic explanation for GATA2-mediated

22

mechanotransduction. Surprisingly, GATA2 is not necessary for the upregulation of FOXC2

23

expression in LVV-ECs in vivo. Therefore, we suggest that the OSS/GATA2/FOXC2 axis is not

24

necessary for the differentiation of valvular endothelial cells. Instead, OSS might be important

25

for lymphatic vessel patterning and the maintenance of FOXC2 expression in valvular

endothelial cells. In line with this model, the mechanosensory ion channel PIEZO1 was

2

recently shown to be necessary for LV development (Nonomura et al. 2018; Choi et al. 2019).

3

Just like GATA2, PIEZO1 is not necessary for the differentiation of LV-ECs (Nonomura et al.

4

2018). Instead, PIEZO1 maintains LV-ECs and regulates their morphogenesis into LVs.

5

Several interesting questions arise from our work for future exploration. Recently,

6

Kontarakis et al reported that they do not observe any obvious edema or lymphatic defects in

7

miR-126-/- embryos (Kontarakis et al. 2018). However, we consistently observe severe edema

8

and lymphatic vascular defects in miR-126-/- embryos (Figure 9B). The reasons for these

9

phenotypic differences remain to be determined. Neither GATA2 nor miR-126 regulates

10

Claudin5 at the mRNA level (Supplementary File 1 and data not shown). Hence, how miR-

11

126 regulates Claudin5 is currently unknown. The mechanisms behind the abnormal patterning

12

of VE-Cadherin are also not known. It will be of interest to generate mice lacking cell junction

13

molecules VE-Cadherin and Claudin5, to determine if they recapitulate any of the phenotypes

14

of Gata2LECKO and miR-126-/- embryos. Future work should also address whether modulators

15

of cell-ECM interaction and cadherin stability such as ADAM19 and MMP15, which are

16

significantly upregulated in shGATA2- and miR-126 sponge-treated HLECs, play

17

physiologically important roles in the development of the lymphatic vasculature.

18

How GATA2 regulates blood-lymph separation is not yet clear. LVV-ECs do not form

19

until E12.0 (Srinivasan and Oliver 2011; Geng et al. 2016). However, the lymph sacs of E11.5

20

Gata2LECKO embryos are blood filled (data not shown). Furthermore, as mentioned previously,

21

Prox1-CreERT2;Gata2f/f embryos did not have blood-filled lymphatics phenotype despite the

22

absence of LVVs (Figure 3E, F). These observations suggest that GATA2 is regulating blood-

23

lymph separation through an LVV-independent mechanism.

24
25

Platelet-expressed CLEC2 and LEC-expressed podoplanin play a critical role in bloodlymph separation (Fu et al. 2008; Bertozzi et al. 2010). Expression of podoplanin is not

1

affected in Gata2LECKO embryos, and platelets are present in Gata2LECKO embryos (data not

2

shown). Together these results suggest that GATA2 regulates blood-lymph separation

3

independent of the platelet/LEC interaction. As GATA2 regulates the expression of numerous

4

genes in blood endothelial cells, and as LECs originate predominantly from embryonic veins,

5

we are tempted to speculate that GATA2 might be regulating blood-lymphatic separation by

6

maintaining blood vascular integrity during the migration of LECs from the veins.

7

Only some patients with mutations in GATA2 will develop lymphedema. A subset of

8

mice lacking one allele Gata2 in endothelial cells display a dilated thoracic duct with reduced

9

lymph flow (Kazenwadel et al. 2015), but they have a normal lifespan and do not develop any

10

obvious symptoms of the human disease such as leukemia, bacterial infections or warts (our

11

unpublished observations). Compared to humans, mice experience less severe gravitational

12

load in the lymphatic vessels of their limbs (Castorena-Gonzalez et al. 2018), which might

13

underlie the absence of obvious lymphatic defects in Gata2+/- mice. Alternative explanations

14

are also possible. Secondary mutations in ASXL1 are frequently observed in Emberger

15

syndrome patients who develop MDS/AML (Crispino and Horwitz 2017). Similarly, a “second

16

hit” in the targets of GATA2, such as miR-126, might be required to trigger the onset of

17

lymphedema in human patients. Non-coding RNAs are powerful biomarkers of human disease

18

due to their ability to be detected in bodily fluids (Van Roosbroeck et al. 2013). Whether

19

circulating miR-126 levels might predict the onset of lymphedema in Emberger syndrome

20

patients needs to be determined.

21

Finally, several miRNA mimics and miRNA inhibitors have entered Phase I, Phase II

22

and preclinical trials and approaches to deliver them are rapidly improving (Rupaimoole and

23

Slack 2017). Hence, we are excited about the possibility that miR-126 might one day be used

24

as a “drug” to treat lymphedema in Emberger syndrome patients.

We used de-identified primary human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs) for experiments.

13

HLEC-1 were from Lonza (CC-2812) and were used for RNA-seq analysis with shGATA2.

14

HLEC-2 (Lonza, CC-2516) were used for all other experiments. HLECs were grown on

15

firbonectin-coated plates or glass slide and were maintained in EBM2 media from Lonza. All

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Around 1.0 X 107 HLECs were used per ChIP.

22

Briefly, HLECs were grown on culture dish at around 100% confluence. Subsequently, HLECs

were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and glycine at a final

twice (ten minutes each) and harvested. Cells were lysed and sonicated as described

2

previously described (Cha et al. 2016; Cha et al. 2018).

3

Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using 3.0 µg of goat anti-mouse GATA2

4

(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or 1.0 µg of normal goat IgG antibody (R&D Systems,

Minneapolis, MN, USA). Q-PCR following ChIP was performed using primers flanking the

Immunohistochemistry of tissues

9

Immunohistochemistry on sections was done according to our previously published protocols

10

(Cha et al. 2016; Geng et al. 2016; Cha et al. 2018). Briefly, freshly collected embryos were

11

washed in 1X PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C. Subsequently,

12

the embryos were washed 3X (10 minutes each) in cold PBS, incubated in 15% sucrose

13

overnight at 4°C and then in 30% sucrose at 4°C until fully submerged in the solution. Embryos

14

were then cryo embedded in OCT solution (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan). 12 µm thick cryosections

15

were prepared using a cryotome (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Model: HM525 NX) and

16

immunohistochemistry was performed using the indicated antibodies. E11.5 embryos were

17

sectioned in a transverse orientation and E12.0-E16.5 embryos were sectioned frontally.

18

Several consecutive sections were analyzed to determine the presence or absence of LVVs

19

and VVs.

20

Whole mount immunohistochemistry using embryonic skin or guts was performed

21

according to our previous protocol (Cha et al. 2016; Cha et al. 2018). Either whole embryos or

22

isolated guts were washed in 1X PBS and fixed in 1% PFA for 1 hr to overnight (depending on

23

the antibody) at 4°C. Subsequently, the dorsal skins were isolated, washed and samples were

24

immunostained using the iDISCO protocol (Renier et al. 2014). Samples were visualized and

25

analyzed as described previously (Cha et al. 2016; Cha et al. 2018).

In situ hybridization

11

We used a kit to detect mmu-miR-126-3p by in situ hybridization (catalog number 339111,

12

Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Briefly, we fixed the embryos in 4% PFA overnight at 4oC.

13

They were then soaked in sucrose, embedded in OCT and sectioned as described above. The

14

sections were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at RT and washed in PBS. Subsequent steps were

15

performed according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Knockdown of GATA2

18

shGATA2 (TTAACAGGCCACTGACCATGAAGAAGGAA) was cloned into a pLV plasmid.

19

Cyagen Bioscience (Santa Clara, CA, USA) generated the lentiviral particles using LentiPAC

20

293 cells. HLECs were seeded at 50-60% confluence on fribronectin-coated plates. The

21

following day cells are infected with equal amounts of shcontrol or shGATA2 virus according to

22

manufacturer protocol for 4-6 hrs in Opti-MEM medium and then changed to regular EBM2

23

media. After 2-3 days cells were harvested with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for

24

RNA-seq study.

Knockout of GATA2 using CRISPR/Cas9

2

sgRNA1 (GGTCTGGGTGCAGACGGCAA), sgRNA2 (ATGCCAACCCCGCTCACGCG) and

3

Cas9 were cloned into a pLV plasmid with puromycin selection marker. The translational start

4

site ATG of GATA2 is located between the recognition sites of sgRNA1 and sgRNA2. Cyagen

5

Bioscience (Santa Clara, CA, USA) generated the lentiviral particles using LentiPAC 293 cells.

6

HLEC-2 were seeded at 50-60% confluence on fibronectin-coated plates. The following day

7

cells were infected with equal amount of control or GATA2 CRIPSPR/cas9 recombinant

8

lentiviral particles according to manufacturer protocol for 4-6 hrs in Opti-MEM medium and

9

then changed to regular EBM2 media. After 24 hrs cells were treated with 0.5µg/mL puromycin

10

to select the cells. After 3 days 0.5µg/mL puromycin treatment almost all non-infected HLECs

11

were dead. We used 5 days of 0.5µg/mL puromycin treatment for selecting GATA2ΔHLEC.

12

A gene-specific primer pair was used that could cover both sgRNA1 and sgRNA2

13

sequences, generating 330 bp long amplicons. The resulting PCR amplicons were purified

14

using MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Sequencing library was constructed from 100 ng

15

DNA and approximately 50-100K 300-base read pairs were generated on an Illumina MiSeq

16

platform. GeneWiz Inc performed library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.

17

A total of 66,473 reads were aligned to reference sequence. Sequences that occurred with

18

the frequency of 5 or more were used for further analysis, and a total 63,526 sequences fit this

19

criterion. Indels were detected in 62,864 sequence reads (~99%). There are 62,808 sequences

20

with deletions. 42,334 reads (67%) harbor a 231 bp deletion between the two targets. 232 bp

21

and 248 bp long deletions were also detected with lower frequencies (13.2%, and 1.2%

22

respectively). There were 2399 sequences (~3.8%) with two deletions (12 bp and 19 bp) within

23

the sgRNA1, and sgRNA2 respectively.

were described previously. Prox1+/Cre mice were maintained in NMRI background. Other mice

6

were maintained in C57BL6 or C57BL6/NMRI mixed backgrounds. We used both male and

miR-126 sponge and miR-126 over expression

11

pSFFV plasmids to sequester miR-126 or over express miR-126 were reported previously

12

(Amendola et al. 2009; Gentner et al. 2009). Cyagen Bioscience (Santa Clara, CA, USA)

13

generated the lentiviral particles using LentiPAC 293 cells. HLECs were seeded at 50-60%

14

confluence on fribronectin-coated plates or glass slide. The following day cells are infected

15

with equal amounts of control, miR-126 sponge or miR-126 over expression virus for 4-6 hrs

16

according to manufacturer protocol using EBM2 medium and then changed to fresh medium.

17

After 2-3 days cells were harvested for appropriate study.

miR-126 isolation and quantitative real-time PCR

20

Micro RNA along with total RNA was isolated from HLECs using QIAzol lysis reagent (Qiagen,

21

Germantown, MD, USA) according to manufacturers instructions. The cDNA was synthesized

22

from total RNA (0.1 - 1.0 µg) with miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). qRT-

23

PCR was performed using miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) in

24

a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). miR-126 Expression levels were

RNA-seq analysis

5

Total RNA was purified from HLECs infected with shGATA2 or control shRNA expressing

6

lentivirus particles. RNA was subjected to ribosomal RNA depletion followed by Truseq

7

stranded total RNA library preparation according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Illumina).

8

RNA from miR-126-sponge treated HLEC-2 were processed using NEB Ultra II directional

9

RNA Library kit for Illumina. The resulting RNA-seq libraries were analyzed on the Illumina

10

HiSeq sequencing platform. The obtained sequencing reads were mapped with the bowtie2

11

algorithm using the RefSeq annotations (hg19 genome build) (Langmead and Salzberg 2012).

12

We utilized the RNA-seq analysis work flow within the Partek Genomics Suite (Partek

13

Incorporated) for quantitation and statistical analysis (ANOVA) of the transcriptome data. We

14

identified those transcripts that exhibited statistically significant differential expression in the

15

shGata2 samples compared to the shControl samples. We rank ordered the two lists based on

16

the expression level and magnitude of change. Using these rank-ordered list, we performed

17

gene ontology (GO) analysis for enriched biological terms (Eden et al. 2009). The genes

18

commonly regulated by GATA2 and miR-126 were analyzed using the functional annotation

19

platform of DAVID (Huang da et al. 2009a; Huang da et al. 2009b).

For biochemical analysis n indicates the number of times the experiments were performed and

3

for histological analysis n indicate the number of embryos analyzed per genotype. VE-

4

Cadherin expression analysis in GATA2ΔHLEC following miR-126 overexpression was performed

5

twice. All other experiments were performed at least three times or more. Data were presented

6

as mean ± SEM. GraphPad Prism 7 software was used to perform the statistical analysis. Data

7

were analyzed by the unpaired, two-tailed, student’s t test. P value < 0.05 was considered

8

significant.

endothelial cells (LVV-ECs).
(A-C) PROX1high LVV-ECs were observed in both E12.0 control (A) and Lyve1-Cre;Gata2f/f (B)
embryos. Blood cells were seen within the lymph sacs (LS) of mutant embryos. (C) No obvious
difference in LVV-EC numbers was observed between the two genotypes.
(D, E) E12.0 Tg(Prox1-tdTomato) (D) and Tg(Prox1-tdTomato); Lyve1-Cre;Gata2f/f (E)

outlined.
(A’) LVV-ECs of control embryos were elongated and compactly aggregated with each other.
They were also aligned perpendicular to the direction of blood flow (red arrow). (B’) In contrast,
LVV-ECs of mutant embryos appear round and dispersed (see cells within the rectangular box)
and appeared to be aligned parallel to the flow. In addition, several dysplastic cells were also
seen (within white and yellow circles).

Figure 3: LVV-ECs are lost from E12.5 embryos lacking GATA2.
(A, B) E12.5 wild type and Lyve1-Cre;Gata2f/f embryos were analyzed by
immunohistochemistry on sections. LVV-ECs had invaginated into the vein in control embryos
(A, arrows). In contrast, very few PROX1+ cells were observed in mutant embryos (B, arrow).
(C, D) E12.5 Tg(Prox1-tdTomato) and Tg(Prox1-tdTomato); Lyve1-Cre;Gata2f/f embryos were
sagitally sectioned along the internal jugular vein (IJV) and the fluorescent signal was analyzed
using confocal microscopy. LVVs with strong tdTomato signal were seen in control (C, arrows),
but not in mutant (D) embryos. (C’, C’’, D’, D’’) The samples from C and D were re-processed
and analyzed by SEM. In controls, LVV-ECs (arrows) with elongated morphology were
observed at the junction of IJV and external jugular vein (EJV) and at the junction of IJV and
subclavian vein (SCV). An opening connecting the lymph and blood circulations was also seen
(arrowhead in C’’). In contrast, endothelial cells at the junction of veins were indistinguishable
from the rest of the venous endothelial cells in mutant embryos (D’, D’’).
(E, F) Lineage tracing was performed using Prox1-CreERT2;R26+/tdTomato in Gata2+/f (E) or
Gata2f/f (F) backgrounds. Tamoxifen was injected at E10.5 to label the PROX1+ LVV-ECs and
LECs with tdTomato. Subsequently, the embryos were analyzed at E15.5. While LVV-ECs
were well labeled in control embryos (E, arrows), LVVs were absent and very few labeled cells
were observed in the veins of mutant embryos (F).

Figure 4: GATA2 is not required for the differentiation of venous valve-, cardiac valve-,
and lymphatic valve-forming endothelial cells.
(A) LVVs (arrows) and venous valves (VVs, arrowheads) were seen at the junction of internal
jugular vein (IJV), subclavian vein (SCV) and superior vena cava (SVC) of E15.5 control
embryos. (B) LVVs were absent in E15.5 Lyve1-Cre;Gata2f/f embryos. While VV-ECs were
present in the mutants (arrowheads), they did not invaginate into the veins and did not have
the proper morphology of VVs.
(C, D) PROX1+ FOXC2+ endothelial cells were observed on the downstream side of cardiac
valves in both control (C) and Prox1+/Cre;Gata2f/f (D) embryos, which lack GATA2 in all PROX1expressing cells. The red arrow indicates the direction of blood flow.
(E-J) Lymphatic vessels in the dorsal skin (E-G) and mesentery (H-J) of E16.5 control and
Prox1-CreERT2;Gata2f/f embryos, which were exposed to tamoxifen at E14.5, were analyzed.
Lymphatic valve-forming endothelial cells (LV-ECs) were seen in both control and mutant
embryos (arrows). However, LV clusters are reduced in mutants (G, J).

Figure 5

Figure 5: RNA-seq identifies the targets of GATA2 in primary human LECs.
(A) Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on RNA-seq data from control shRNA
and shGATA2 infected primary human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs). A high level of
similarity was observed within the groups as indicated by their proximity to each other. (B)
Hierarchical clustering shows that approximately 1000 genes were consistently downregulated
and 600 genes were upregulated in shGATA2 treated HLECs. (C) GO revealed a list of genes
that are likely relevant to the phenotypes observed mice lacking GATA2. (D) GATA2 was
knocked out from a second HLEC line using CRISPR/Cas9. Western blot revealed the lack of
GATA2 and the downregulation of EGFL7 and ANGPT2 in the knock out cells (HLEC∆GATA2). In
contrast, no obvious differences were observed in the expression of PROX1. Additionally,
qRT-PCR revealed the downregulation of miR-126.
Statistics: (A) n=3 independent experiments per shRNA; (D) n= 3 independent experiments
(antibiotic selection, Western blot and qRT-PCR). (**) p<0.01

Figure 5- Figure Supplement 1: Efficient deletion of GATA2 from HLECs by
CRISPR/Cas9.
The second exon (out of six total exons) of GATA2 is schematically shown. Sequences
corresponding to the sgRNAs are in bold and are underlined. The PAM sequences are in red.
The ATG of GATA2 is located in between sgRNA1 and sgRNA2. HLEC-2 were infected with
lentiviruses expressing Cas9 and the two sgRNAs and selected using puromycin. The region
between sgRNA1 and sgRNA2 was PCR amplified and was sequenced using NGS approach.
The sequence and contribution of major indels is depicted. These results demonstrate that
~99% of DNA fragments have large deletions in exon 2 of GATA2.
Statistics: Sequencing was performed using one batch of selected cells (out of 3 independently
selected batches).

Figure 7: EGFL7/miR-126 is a target of GATA2.
(A) miR-126 was expressed in the dorsal aorta (DA) and in the LVV-ECs (arrow) of control
embryos. (B) Expression of miR-126 was downregulated in the LVV-ECs (arrows) of E12.0
Lyve1-Cre;Gata2f/f embryos. However, no obvious difference in miR-126 expression was
observed in the dorsal aorta (DA) of mutants.
(C) EGFL7 was expressed in the mesenteric arteries (A), veins (V) and lymphatic vessels (L)
of E18.5 control embryos. Strongest expression of EGFL7 was observed in LVs (arrow). (D)
Expression of EGFL7 was dramatically downregulated in the mesenteric lymphatic vessels of
mice lacking GATA2 in LECs. Also, notice the absence of LVs in the mutant.
(E) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that GATA2 strongly associates with the
promoter element of the EGFL7/miR-126 locus. The top lane of the gel picture was PCR
performed using primers flanking the GATA2 binding site. The lower lane was PCR performed
using primers for a non-specific site. The graph compares qPCR signals generated by primers
flanking the GATA2 binding site.

Figure 8: miR-126-/- embryos are phenotypically similar to mice lacking Gata2 in LECs.
(A, B) LVVs (arrows) and VVs (arrowheads) were seen at the junction of internal jugular vein
(IJV) and subclavian vein (SCV) of E16.5 control (A) but not miR-126-/- (B) embryos. A few
PROX1+ cells were nevertheless seen at the interface of vein and lymph sacs (B, yellow
arrowhead).
(C, D) LVV-ECs were observed in both E12.0 control and miR-126-/- littermates (arrows)
indicating that miR-126 is not necessary for the differentiation of LVV-ECs.
(E, F) LVs were observed in the mesenteric lymphatic vessels of E16.5 control embryos (E,
arrow). PROX1 expression was higher in the LVs compared to LECs. (F) LVs were absent and
PROX1 expression was homogeneous in the LECs of miR-126-/- littermates.
(G, H) Lymphatic vessels in the dorsal skin had migrated from the lateral edges until the
midline (red dotted lines) in control (G) but not the miR-126-/- (H) embryos. In addition, the
lymphatic vessels of the mutants were dilated with fewer branch points.
Abbreviations: IJV, internal jugular vein; SCV, subclavian vein; LS, lymph sac.
Measuring bar: (A-F) 200 µm; (G, H) 1000 µm.
Statistics: (A-D) n= 3 embryos and 6 LVV complexes per genotype; (E-H) n= 3 embryos per
genotype.

Figure 9

Figure 9: Deletion of Spred1 does not rescue the lymphatic vascular phenotypes of miR126-/- embryos.
(A-D) Severe peripheral edema (arrows) was observed in E16.5 miR-126-/- (B) and miR-126-/- ;
Spred1-/- (D) embryos. (C) E16.5 Spred1-/- embryos do not have obvious edema.
(E-H) E16.5 Spred1-/- embryos had LVVs (E, arrows) and had normal lymphatic patterning (G).
Deletion of Spred1 does not rescue the absence of LVVs (F) or lymphatic vessel patterning
defect (H) of miR-126-/- embryos. The dotted lines indicate the midline of dorsal skin.
Abbreviations: IJV, internal jugular vein; LS, lymph sac.

Statistics: (A-D, G-H) n= 3 embryos per genotype; (E, F) n=3 embryos, 6 LVV complexes per
genotype.

Figure 10: GATA2 and miR-126 are necessary for the expression of cell junction
molecules Claudin5 and VE-Cadherin.
(A, B) Expression of tight junction molecule Claudin5 (CLDN5) was dramatically
downregulated in the dorsal skin lymphatic vessels of E16.5 miR-126-/- embryos (B’). The
intensity of VE-Cadherin staining appeared to be not different between control (A’’) and mutant
(B’’) embryos. However, closer inspection revealed that VE-Cadherin was uniformly expressed
along the cell boundaries of control embryos (A’’’), but was localized in a “zig zag” pattern in
mutant (B’’’) embryos.
(C, D) Claudin5 was downregulated (D, left inset) and VE-Cadherin had a defective localization
with gaps (D, right inset) in the dorsal skin lymphatic vessels of E16.5 Lyve1-Cre;Gata2f/f
embryos.
(E) The LECs of mesenteric lymphatic vessels were elongated in the direction of lymph flow
(red arrow) in E18.5 control embryos. VE-Cadherin was uniformly expressed around the cell
boundaries of control LECs. In contrast, the LECs were misaligned and VE-Cadherin appeared
to be mislocalized in embryos lacking GATA2 (F).
Measuring bar: (A, B) 200 µm; (A”’-B’”) 25 µm; (C-F) 50 µm.
Statistics: n= 3 embryos per genotype.

Figure 11

Figure 11: GATA2 regulates the expression of Claudin5 and VE-Cadherin in HLECs in a
miR-126 dependent manner.
(A) Claudin5 and (B) VE-Cadherin were uniformly expressed in the cell boundaries of control
HLECs. In contrast, (C) Claudin5 was dramatically downregulated and (D) VE-Cadherin was
expressed in a zig zag pattern (arrowheads) on the cell boundaries of HLEC∆GATA2. (E-H)
Expression of a miR-126 sponge using lentivirus strikingly downregulated Claudin5 (F) and
caused disruptions in VE-Cadherin localization (H, arrowheads) in HLECs.
(I, J) Overexpression of miR-126 using lentiviral particles significantly rescued the expression
of Claudin5 (I) and VE-Cadherin (J) expressions in HLEC∆GATA2.
(K) The intensity of Claudin5 expression and the number of cells with uniform expression of
VE-Cadherin were quantified and graphically shown in K.
Measuring bar: (A-F) 25 µm; (H-K) 50 µm.
Statistics: (A-D, E-H, I) n = 3; (J) n=2. (**) p<0.01; (*) p<0.05.

Figure 12

Figure 12: GATA2 regulates endothelial cell junctions through miR-126.
Under normal conditions GATA2 enhances the expression of miR-126 in the lymphatic
vasculature. The targets of miR-126 are upregulated in the absence of GATA2, which results
in the downregulation of Claudin5 and mislocalization of VE-Cadherin. Consequently,
lymphatic vascular morphogenesis is defective due to abnormal shape of LECs and LVV-ECs.
