Abstract
Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug among pregnant women. Moreover, over half of
pregnant women who are consuming cannabis are also consuming alcohol; however, the
consequences of combined prenatal alcohol and cannabis exposure on fetal development are
not well understood. The current study examined behavioral development following exposure to
ethanol (EtOH) and/or CP-55,940 (CP), a cannabinoid receptor agonist. From postnatal days
(PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to the third trimester, Sprague-Dawley rats
received EtOH (5.25g/kg/day) or sham intubation, as well as CP (0.4 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. All
subjects were tested on open field activity (PD 18-21), spatial learning (PD 40-46), and elevated
plus maze (PD 30) tasks. Both EtOH and CP increased locomotor activity in the open field, and
the combination produced more severe overactivity than either exposure alone. Similarly,
increases in thigmotaxis in the Morris water maze were caused by either EtOH or CP alone, and
were more severe with combined exposure, although only EtOH impaired spatial learning.
Finally, developmental CP, but not EtOH, increased time spent in the open arms on the
elevated plus maze. Overall, these data indicate that EtOH and CP produce some independent
domain-specific effects, but many effects of EtOH and CP on behavior were additive.
Importantly, these data suggest that combined prenatal exposure to alcohol and cannabis may
be more damaging to the developing fetus, which has implications for the lives of affected
individuals and families and also for establishing public health policy.

1. Introduction
The adverse consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure have been extensively
studied over the past 40 years (Riley et al., 2011). Individuals exposed to alcohol
prenatally may suffer from a range of physical, neurological, and behavioral
consequences referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD include
growth deficits, facial dysmorphology, as well as altered cognitive, emotional, and
behavioral functions (Riley et al., 2011). Approximately 1 in 10 women in the U.S. report
some alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2015; Substance Use and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014).
Thus, FASD continues to pose a serious public health problem in the U.S., as well as
around the globe (Roozen et al., 2016).
Prenatal alcohol exposure alters development of numerous brain regions, leading
to structural and functional alterations in such areas as the basal ganglia, cerebellum,
cortex and hippocampus (Moore et al., 2014) as well as white matter tracts (Taylor et al.,
2015; Uban et al., 2017). Alcohol-induced neuropathology can lead to behavioral
alterations and impairments in learning, attention, executive functioning, and emotional
regulation, all of which can cause serious problems in school and daily life (Khoury et al.,
2015; Mattson et al., 2011; Norman et al., 2013). Similarly, animal studies have also
shown that developmental alcohol exposure alters brain development, producing a
variety of behavioral alterations, including hyperactivity, increased anxiety-related
behaviors, and impaired learning and memory (Schneider et al., 2011).
However, alcohol is not the only drug of abuse consumed by pregnant women.
Recent reports show that 5.4% of pregnant women reported using illicit drugs
(Substance Use and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014), with higher rates of
use among younger pregnant women (15-17 years; 14.6%) (Substance Use and Mental
Health Services Administration, 2014). The most commonly used illicit drug among

women of reproductive age is cannabis (Substance Use and Mental Health Services
Administration, 2014), with prevalence rates of 3-4% among pregnant women in
Western countries (Ebrahim et al., 2003; El Marroun et al., 2011). Similar to alcohol, the
primary psychoactive constituent in cannabis (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) and its
metabolites can freely cross the placenta and directly affect the fetus (Gómez et al.,
2003). Of particular concern are the steadily increasing amounts of THC in cannabis
products. In 2016, the average potency of THC in cannabis-related products was 11%
(Botticelli, 2017); this number has continually risen from 3.4% in 1993 and is even higher
among synthetic variations (Botticelli, 2016; Mehmedic et al., 2010). Importantly, many
women perceive cannabis as safe to use during pregnancy (Saint Louis, 2017).
Although the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are well
established, much less is known of the consequences of prenatal cannabis exposure,
particularly at the high levels consumed today. There are few prospective clinical studies
(such as Generation R) (Jaddoe et al., 2012) examining the effects of prenatal cannabis
exposure (Huizink, 2014), and results from these and retrospective studies are mixed,
likely due to differences in cannabis exposure levels, prospective vs. retrospective
approaches, confounding of other drug use like tobacco, age and nature of outcome
measures, as well as a host of other methodological, maternal, and environmental
factors. In general, evidence suggests that prenatal cannabis exposure may alter
emotional, behavioral, and cognitive development in clinical populations, particularly in
executive functioning domains (Huizink, 2014). Unfortunately, the consequences of
prenatal exposure to the increased THC potencies available today will not be known for
years to come. Animal studies are similarly inconsistent; while prenatal THC exposure
may not cause neuronal cell death in areas such as the hippocampus, cortex, and
thalamus (Hansen et al., 2008), animal model studies do illustrate that prenatal
cannabinoid exposure can produce hyperactivity (Huizink et al., 2006), increase anxiety-

related behaviors (Goldschmidt et al., 2004), and impair working (Smith et al., 2006) and
long-term memory (Mereu et al., 2003), although behavioral results are mixed. In
addition, perinatal cannabinoid exposure has been shown to impair reproductive
functioning in male mice (D'Alterio et al., 1979) and disrupts neurodevelopmental CB1
signaling later in adulthood (de Salas-Quiroga et al., 2015). Similar to clinical studies,
mixed results likely vary based on differences in timing, dose and form of cannabinoid,
outcome measures, and nature of control groups (Abel et al., 1986; Huizink, 2014;
Schneider, 2009; Trezza et al., 2012).
Moreover, the effects of concurrent exposure to alcohol and cannabis are not
known, despite the high rates of co-use reported among women of child-bearing age. A
recent analysis found that 8.7% of females use both alcohol and cannabis, with 5.5%
reporting simultaneous use, suggesting that individuals who use both drugs tend to
consume them at the same time (Subbaraman et al., 2015). Higher rates of
simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use (15.3%) were observed in the 18-29 year age
group (Subbaraman et al., 2015), which is consistent with other recent data showing that
19.5% of individuals under age 21 reported smoking cannabis within 2 hours of
consuming alcohol (Substance Use and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014).
Importantly, cannabis is also the illicit drug most commonly used simultaneously
with alcohol among women who binge drink during pregnancy (Bhuvaneswar et al.,
2007); approximately 50% of pregnant women who have reported consuming cannabis
were also drinking alcohol (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,
2015). These numbers may be even higher than reports suggest; accurate data
reflecting concurrent use and exposure levels among pregnant women are difficult to
obtain, not only because women who consume either alcohol or cannabis frequently
under-report their usage (Lange et al., 2014; Lendoiro et al., 2013; Midanik, 1988), but
also because of the rapidly changing legalization, accessibility, and potency of cannabis.

In addition, approximately 50% of pregnancies are unplanned. Thus, fetuses may be
exposed to these drugs before pregnancy is recognized, which is alarming given the
high rates of concurrent use.
The possibility that these drugs may interact with one another is strengthened by
the role of endogenous cannabinoids in alcohol-induced neurodegenerative pathways
(Subbanna et al., 2013), depression of synaptic activity (Nagre et al., 2015), and
impaired DNA methylation (Basavarajappa et al., 2008). Furthermore, alcohol can alter
the development of endocannabinoid systems, including neuronal communication and
circuit formation, which may lead to deficits in neuronal plasticity (Basavarajappa, 2015).
Thus, concurrent exposure during early development may be even more detrimental to
the developing fetus than either drug alone.
However, there is limited research on co-exposure to prenatal alcohol and
cannabis on brain and behavioral development. Most clinical (Fried et al., 1987; Fried et
al., 1992; Fried et al., 1990; Richardson et al., 2002) and animal studies (Hansen et al.,
2008; Subbanna et al., 2013) have focused on the effects of each drug separately (Fried
et al., 1987; Fried et al., 1992; Fried et al., 1990; Richardson et al., 2002), rather than
the combination of effects. Research that has examined the combined effects suggest
that concurrent cannabinoid and alcohol exposure can significantly increase fetal toxicity
(Abel et al., 1987) and synergistically increase neurotoxicity in the hippocampus
(Hansen et al., 2008) in rodents. In addition, exposure to cannabinoids on gestational
day (GD) 8 produces craniological, ocular, and brain abnormalities in a dose-dependent
manner (Gilbert et al., 2016), whereas concurrent alcohol and cannabinoid exposure
yielded synergistic effects, showing greater physical abnormalities than exposure to
either alcohol or cannabinoids alone (Fish et al., 2017; Fish et al., 2016). Nonetheless,
research on behavioral development following co-exposure is lacking. Limited previous
clinical (Goldschmidt et al., 2004) and animal studies (Abel et al., 1990) have failed to

find any interactions of prenatal alcohol and THC on behavioral development, but these
studies investigated low doses of THC or alcohol, notably lower than the THC levels
consumed by individuals today.
To examine the possible consequences of combined developmental exposure to
alcohol and cannabinoids on behavioral development, we used a rat model of drug
exposure during the 3rd trimester brain growth spurt equivalent (postnatal days (PD) 4-9).
Importantly, this is a period of development particularly sensitive to ethanol (Goodlett et
al., 1991; Olney et al., 2002) and a period in which the endogenous cannabinoid system
plays an important role in neuronal development (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2000). The
brain growth spurt is characterized by neuronal maturation, including axonal growth,
dendritic arborization, as well as high rates of synaptogenesis, gliogenesis, and
myelination (Dobbing et al., 1979; Gauda, 2006). Additionally, CB1 receptor levels rapidly
increase in numerous brain regions during this time (Belue et al., 1995; Berrendero et al.,
1999; Rodriguez de Fonseca et al., 1993).
The current study used the synthetic CB1 and CB2 receptor agonist CP-55,940
(CP) to mimic the effects of THC. CP is as an ingredient in synthetic marijuana
preparations (Berkovitz et al., 2011) and is commonly used in cannabinoid research (Tai
et al., 2014) as it has a similar duration of action, peak effect, and neurobehavioral
effects as THC (McGregor et al., 1996). CP was administered in a manner equivalent to
a moderate-high dose in humans (Desrosiers et al., 2014; Garcıa
́ -Gil et al., 1999; Little
et al., 1988) and combined with a well-established binge-like dose of alcohol (McGough
et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2012).
All subjects were tested on a battery of behavioral tests to investigate effects of
combined exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids on behavioral development. The
behavioral battery included an open-field activity chamber (activity levels), an elevated

plus maze (anxiety-related behaviors), and a Morris water maze task (visuospatial
learning). Following the behavioral battery, gross brain weights (g) were measured.

2. Material and Methods
The goal of the current study was to examine the effects of combined neonatal
alcohol and cannabinoid exposure on behavioral development (see Figure 1). All
procedures and behavioral paradigms included in this study were approved by the San
Diego State University (SDSU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
and are in accordance with the National Institute of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals.

Subjects
For breeding, one male and one female Sprague-Dawley rat were housed

together overnight at the SDSU Animal Care facilities at the Center for Behavioral
Teratology. Once a seminal plug was present, dams were individually housed in
standard plastic cages (gestational [GD] 0) and left undisturbed until the day of delivery
(typically GD 22), except for routine husbandry. On postnatal day (PD) 1, the day after
birth, litters were pseudo-randomly culled to 8 pups with equal numbers of male and
female subjects (whenever possible). Subjects were then randomly assigned to each

exposure group; no more than one sex pair per litter was used within each exposure
condition to control for potential litter effects. A total of 142 subjects were treated from 18
litters.

2.2.

Developmental Alcohol and Cannabinoid Exposure
From postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a time period equivalent to the human third

trimester “brain growth spurt,” half of the subjects were intragastrically intubated with
ethanol (EtOH, 5.25 g/kg/day) dissolved in an artificial milk diet (11.9% v/v, 27.5 mL/kg,
twice per day, 2 hours apart), followed by 2 additional feedings of milk diet only
(Goodlett et al., 1997). Briefly, the intubation procedure involved lubricating a thin,
silastic tubing (PE-50) with corn oil, inserting the tubing into the pup’s mouth to be
swallowed into the stomach, and injecting the milk diet through the tubing (Goodlett et
al., 1997). The other half of subjects received sham intubations, which involved full
insertion of the tubing, but with no EtOH or milk exposure. In addition, all subjects were
injected (i.p.10 ml/kg) with either CP (0.4 mg/kg/day) or the vehicle (VEH; 10%
dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO] and sterilized saline). Injections utilized a 30-gauge needle
with a guide to allow only the tip of the needle to enter the i.p. area. All pups were
removed from the dam simultaneously and maintained on a heating pad (110 °F)
throughout the exposure period. Each intubation and injection took approximately one
minute per pup to complete; litters were returned to the dam within 10 minutes of
separation.
Offspring were tattooed for identification purposes with non-toxic veterinary tattoo
ink on PD 7, allowing the experimenter to remain blind during later behavioral testing;
prior to PD 7, a non-toxic marker was used for identification. Subjects were weaned on
PD 21 and group-housed by sex on PD 28. All subjects were housed at a constant

humidity and temperature (21±1°C) in plastic cages with woodchips, and exposed to a
12-hour light/dark cycle, receiving food and water ad libitum.

2.2.1. Drug Preparation
Ethanol (11.9% v/v) was added to an artificial milk diet (West et al., 1984). CP-55,940
(CP; Enzo Life Sciences, NY) was dissolved into a stock solution (5 mg of CP dissolved into
2mL of 100% Dimethyl Sulfoxide [DMSO] Sigma-Aldrich, MO) and kept at -20°C until daily
injections volumes were made. Daily injection volumes were prepared by combining the CP
stock solution with the vehicle (10% DMSO in physiological saline) to the appropriate final dose
(0.4 mg/kg/day).

2.2.2. Behavioral Testing
2.2.2.1 Activity Levels
From PD 18-21, activity levels in an open field were measured in all subjects
during the dark cycle (evening). For 60 min, all subjects placed in separate, dark openfield activity chambers (41 x 46 x 38 cm; Hamilton-Kinder) equipped with fans for
ventilation and white noise. Prior to weaning (PD 21), subjects were removed from the
dam simultaneously before being placed in the chambers (a potential stressor), while on
PD 21 weaning had already occurred. Activity levels were recorded in 5-min bins via
interruptions of infrared beams, indicating overall activity levels, location and time spent
in different areas of the chamber, and behaviors such as rearing.

2.2.2.2 Anxiety-Related Behaviors
On PD 25, anxiety-related behaviors were measured in all subjects using an
elevated plus maze test. The plus sign-shaped maze is elevated 50 cm above the floor,
with two exposed arms and two enclosed arms (50 x 10 cm); the maze is made of clear

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/513796; this version posted January 7, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

11
Plexiglas except for the black sides of the enclosed arms (40 cm). Subjects were placed
in the center of the maze and allowed to roam freely for 5 min. A video camera recorded
subjects’ locations on the maze (open vs closed arms), time spent in each area, as well
as grooming and rearing behaviors, which were later coded using OdLog software. The
center of the maze was coded as an open arm.

2.2.2.3 Visuospatial Learning and Memory
From PD 40-46, all subjects were tested for visuospatial memory performance
using a Morris water maze. Subjects were required to use spatial cues in the room to
remember the location of a clear Plexiglas platform (4-inch diameter) hidden 1 inch
below the water surface of a black tank (48-inch diameter) filled with water. All data were
recorded via a video tracking system interfaced with Water2020 software (HVS Image).
For acquisition, subjects were tested for 4 trials per day over 6 consecutive days
with an inter-trial interval of 3-5 min. For each trial, the platform location remained
consistent, while the starting position changed. Subjects were given 60 sec to find and
swim to the platform; if subjects failed to find the platform, they were guided. Once on
the platform, subjects were given 10 additional sec to observe spatial location. Distance
and latency traveled to find the platform, as well as heading angle, and thigmotaxis
(“wall-hugging,” outer 10% of the pool) were measured. Twenty-four hours after the last
acquisition trial, subjects were given a 60-sec probe trial, in which the platform was
removed and memory of the platform location was measured by examining time spent
and passes through the platform area.

2.2.3. Brain Collection
Brains were collected from all subjects via intracardial perfusion between PD 4751. Subjects were given a lethal dose of pentobarbital (10% pentobarbital in sterile

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/513796; this version posted January 7, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

12
saline, 3 mL/kg, i.p.) and perfused with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Once perfused,
the forebrain and cerebellum were collected and weighed.

2.3.

Statistical Analyses
All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences

(SPSS, version 24). All analyses used a 2 (EtOH exposure: EtOH, Sham) x 2 (CP
exposure: CP, VEH) x 2 (sex: female, male) ANOVA. Repeated measures ANOVAs for
Day, 5-minute Time Bin (Bin), and/or Trial were used when applicable. Post hoc
analyses were conducted using Student-Newman-Keuls. Means (M) and standard
errors of the mean (SEM) are reported when applicable. All significance levels were set
at p < 0.05. In addition, to determine if CP had effects by itself or altered ethanol’s
effects, specific post-hoc comparisons were made between CP and controls and
between CP+EtOH and EtOH groups.

3. Results
At least 10 subjects per exposure group and sex completed all behavioral tasks
(EtOH + CP: 23 [13 F, 10 M], EtOH + VEH: 30 [16 F, 14 M], Sham + CP: 30 [15 F, 15 M],
Sham + VEH: 28 [13 F, 15 M]).

3.1.

Body Weights
On the first day of the open-field activity testing (PD 18), subjects exposed to

EtOH during development weighed significantly less than sham-intubated subjects
(F[1,103] = 38.19, p < 0.001; Figure 2). There was also a main effect of CP (F[1,103] =
7.40, p < 0.01); although there was no significant interaction of EtOH*CP on body
weights during this period, the main effect of CP was driven by reductions in body weight
among subjects exposed to EtOH+CP. Although there were no effects of sex on body

13
weight during open-field activity, males weighed more than females during the remaining
behavioral tests (p’s < 0.001). Sex did not interact with either developmental EtOH or
CP exposure at any time.

early adulthood. CP exposure exacerbated the ethanol-related growth reductions up to
PD 25. *** = EtOH+CP < EtOH+Vehicle; ** = EtOH < Sham; * = CP < Vehicle.

On PD 25, during the elevated plus maze task, there was an interaction of
EtOH*CP exposure on body weights (F[1,103] = 6.26, p < 0.05). Subjects exposed to
combined EtOH+CP during development weighed less than those exposed to EtOH
alone (F[1,51] = 7.32, p < 0.01), whereas subjects exposed to only CP did not weigh
significantly different from controls (F[1,56] = 0.15, p = 0.70). However, by the first day of
the Morris water maze test (PD 40), only a main effect of developmental EtOH exposure
persisted (F[1,103] = 8.45, p < 0.01), as EtOH-exposed subjects weighed less than their

14
sham-intubated counterparts, regardless of CP exposure. EtOH-related reductions in
body weight persisted until sacrifice (PD 49) (F[1,103] = 11.41, p < 0.01). In contrast,
developmental CP exposure had no significant long-lasting effects on body weights.

3.2.

Activity Levels
All activity measures were initially analyzed using a 4 (Day) x 12 (Bin) x 2 (EtOH) x 2

(CP) x 2 (Sex) repeated measures ANOVA. All subjects habituated within and across testing
days on all activity measures, producing main effects of Day (p’s < 0.001), Bin (p’s < 0.001), and
interaction of Day*Bin (p’s < 0.001). Habituation differences among treatment groups are noted,
if applicable. No differences between male or female subjects were observed in any activity
measure.

3.2.1. Overall Activity
Subjects exposed to EtOH during development were more active than sham-intubated
subjects, as evident by increased total distance traveled (F[1,103] = 28.9, p < 0.001; Figure 3A).
In addition, EtOH-exposed subjects habituated slower, producing a Bin*EtOH interaction
(F[11,1133] = 4.2, p < 0.001; Figure 3B). Although the interaction of EtOH and CP failed to
reach statistical significance, CP by itself did significantly increase total distance traveled in
sham, but not EtOH-exposed, subjects (F[1,56) = 5.1, p < 0.05; Figure 3A). In addition,
locomotor activity of subjects exposed to CP did not habituate to the same level as controls,
producing a Day*Bin*CP interaction (F[33,3399] = 1.5, p < 0.05). Similar effects were observed
in the total number of beam breaks (data not shown).

3.2.2. Center-Related Activity
In contrast, when locomotor activity in the center of the chamber was examined,
the combination of developmental EtOH+CP exposure produced more severe
overactivity than either exposure by itself. Separately, both EtOH and CP increased
locomotor activity in the center of the chamber, producing main effects of EtOH (F[1,103]
= 53.1, p < 0.001) and CP (F[1,103] = 8.1, p < 0.01; Figure 4A). However, subjects
exposed to combined EtOH+CP took significantly longer to habituate compared to all
other groups (Figure 4B), producing a 3-way interaction of Bin*EtOH*CP (F[11,1133] =
1.9, p < 0.05). Importantly, although the combination of EtOH and CP increased
locomotor activity in the center of the chamber, only developmental EtOH exposure
significantly increased the time spent in the center of the chamber (F[1,103] = 16.4, p <
0.001; Figures 4C, 4D). CP exposure had no significant effect on time spent in the
center, nor did ethanol and CP interact on this measure. Similar effects were seen with
entries into the center of the chamber (data not shown).

3.2.3. Exploratory Activity
Overall, EtOH exposure increased rearing in the chamber (F[1,103] = 7.1, p < 0.01),
regardless of CP exposure. A Day*EtOH interaction was present (F[3,309] = 5.0, p < 0.01), as
EtOH-exposed subjects exhibited less habituation over days (Figure 3C), rearing significantly
more during the last three days of open field activity testing (PD 19-21; p’s < 0.01). In addition, a
three-way interaction between Day*Bin*CP was evident (F[33,3399] = 1.7, p < 0.01), as
subjects exposed to CP took longer to habituate rearing across and within sessions (Figure 3D).

3.3.

Anxiety-Related Behaviors
The elevated plus maze utilizes rats’ natural aversion to open spaces and other

behaviors to infer levels of anxiety. All measures on this task were analyzed using a 2
(EtOH) x 2 (CP) x 2 (Sex) ANOVA. Exposure to EtOH during development did not
significantly alter the time spent on the open versus closed arms of the elevated plus
maze, nor did it alter the frequency of open, closed, or total arm entries. In contrast,
developmental CP exposure increased the time spent on the open arms of the elevated
plus maze (F[1,103] = 5.91, p < 0.05; Figure 5A). Although an interaction of EtOH*CP
was not significant, it should be noted that this effect was driven by an increase in open
arm time among subjects exposed only to CP compared to controls (F[1,56] = 9.39, p <
0.01); CP had no effect among EtOH-exposed subjects (F[1,51] = 0.43, p = 0.52).
Importantly, CP exposure did not alter the frequency (Figure 5B) or the ratio of different
arm entry, suggesting that CP-exposed subjects specifically spent more time in the open
areas of the maze.

Figure 5. CP exposure during the 3rd trimester equivalent increased the total time spent
on the open arms of the elevated plus maze, driven by a CP-related increase among
sham-intubated subjects (A). In contrast, EtOH exposure decreased the time spent
grooming (C) and the number of rearing (D) behaviors on the maze. No groups differed
in overall activity on the plus maze (B). * = CP > Vehicle; ** = EtOH < Sham.

20
However, EtOH exposure decreased the time spent grooming (F[1,103 = 9.39, p
< 0.01; Figure 5C), grooming frequency (F[1,103] = 4.55, p < 0.05), and average
grooming bout duration (F[1,103] = 4.98, p < 0.05). In addition, developmental EtOH
exposure also reduced the frequency of rearing, an exploratory behavior (F[1,103] =
10.19. p < 0.01; Figure 5D), but not affect the total time spent rearing or average rearing
bout. Neither grooming nor rearing behaviors were altered by developmental CP
exposure. Moreover, there were no interactions between EtOH*CP or effects of Sex on
any behaviors on the elevated plus maze.

Spatial Learning

3.4.1. Acquisition
All acquisition data were initially analyzed using a 6 (Day) x 2 (EtOH) x 2 (CP) x 2
(Sex) repeated measures ANOVA. Although performance in all subjects improved over
acquisition days (effects of day, p’s < 0.001), subjects exposed to EtOH during
development exhibited impairments in spatial learning. EtOH-exposed subjects learned
more slowly than controls and required longer path lengths to find the platform compared
to controls, producing an interaction of Day*EtOH (F[5,515] = 2.19, p = 0.05), as well as
a main effect of EtOH (F[1,103] = 39.90, p < 0.001; Figure 6A). Similar effects were seen
with latency to find the platform, even though EtOH-exposed subjects did swim faster. In
addition, EtOH-exposed subjects were less precise in aiming toward the platform,
exhibiting larger heading angles (F[1,103] = 15.73, p < 0.001; Figure 6B). Finally, males
performed better than females on all acquisition measures (p’s < 0.01).

Figure 6. Developmental EtOH exposure impaired performance on the spatial learning
task (A, B), whereas EtOH and CP separately increased thigmotaxis during acquisition
(C). Only developmental EtOH exposure significantly impaired spatial memory during the
probe test. (D). ** EtOH < Sham.

In contrast, both developmental EtOH and CP exposure separately increased
thigmotaxis (wall-hugging, outer 10% of the diameter) during acquisition (Figure 6C), but
did not interact. Subjects exposed to EtOH spent more time (F[1,103] = 26.23, p <

22
0.001) and did not decline in thigmotaxis as quickly as sham-intubated subjects,
producing an interaction of Day*EtOH (F[5,515] = 5.92, p < 0.001). Similarly, subjects
exposed to CP spent more time in thigmotaxis across days (F[1,103] = 4.20, p < 0.05).
The same effects were seen in thigmotaxic path lengths (data not shown).

3.4.2. Test (Probe)
The probe test occurred on a single day, so a 2 (EtOH) x 2 (CP) x 2 (Sex)
ANOVA was utilized. Only developmental EtOH exposure impaired performance during
the probe trial. EtOH-exposed subjects spent less time in the platform area (3 times the
diameter of the platform; 1 of 8 possible locations; F[1,103] = 14.41, p < 0.001; Figure
6D); similar effects were seen in the ratio of time spent in the target area versus all other
areas as well as time spent in the platform quadrant (1 of 4 quadrants; data not shown).
In addition, EtOH-exposed subjects also passed through the platform area less often,
including in comparison to passes through all other areas combined (target-pass ratio,
data not shown). No main effects or interactions with developmental CP exposure were
observed in any measure. Overall, females performed worse than males, regardless of
exposure type (p’s < 0.01).

Brain Weights
Developmental EtOH exposure decreased total gross brain weights (F[1,103] =

11.88, p < 0.01; Figure 7A), but did not alter the total brain-body weight ratios. EtOH
exposure also decreased the forebrain (F[1,103] = 79.17, p < 0.001; Figure 7B) and
cerebellum (F[1,103] = 59.72, p < 0.001; Figure 7C) weights, as well as the forebrain(F[1,103] = 17.86, p < 0.001) and cerebellum-body weight ratios (F[1,103] = 37.03, p <
0.001)(data not shown). Developmental CP exposure did not significantly alter gross

23
weights of any brain region. Finally, male subjects had greater weights and ratios for
total brain, forebrain, and cerebellum, compared to female subjects (p’s < 0.001).

4. Discussion
The current study suggests that exposure to combined alcohol and cannabinoids during
early postnatal development may alter brain and behavioral development in a domain-specific
manner. Importantly, concurrent exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids during development may
disrupt behavioral development more than prenatal exposure to either drug alone. This was
particularly evident in open field activity.
First, exposure to developmental alcohol increased overall activity levels, with elevations
in locomotor activity, rearing, as well as entries and time spent in the center of the chamber.

24
Consistent with the results of this study, past preclinical research has consistently shown that
rats exposed to alcohol during early development display increased activity levels (Thomas et
al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2007; Tran et al., 2000), which corresponds to clinical reports that
children with FASD are commonly hyperactive (Mattson et al., 2011), although some clinical
data fail to find difference in activity levels (Glass et al., 2014). Similarly, developmental CP
exposure alone also increased locomotor activity, rearing and center travel and entries.
Preclinical data examining activity levels following prenatal cannabis exposure are more limited
and inconsistent. One study has shown that limited prenatal THC exposure (GD 10-12)
increased activity levels from PD 9-21, yet did not increase time the spent within the center of
the chamber (Borgen et al., 1973), which is consistent with the findings of the current study.
However, other preclinical studies have shown no difference or even decreased activity levels in
early adulthood (Fride et al., 1996). Limited clinical studies report that children (El Marroun et al.,
2009; Hofman et al., 2004; Jaddoe et al., 2012; Jaddoe et al., 2010) and adolescents (Fried et
al., 1988) prenatally exposed to marijuana exhibit hyperactivity, further indicating that exposure
to cannabinoids may have long-lasting effects on activity levels.
The effects of combined developmental alcohol and THC were largely additive, with
subjects exposed to both drugs exhibiting the most severe increases in activity levels. However,
there were some synergistic effects, as subjects exposed to combined developmental alcohol
and cannabinoids habituated more slowly compared to all other groups. This alteration may
represent unique deficits in simple learning, as habituation represents learning of the
environment. While these measures have not been well examined in preclinical studies, clinical
reports do suggest that children (Goldschmidt et al., 2000) and adolescents (Fried et al., 1988)
prenatally exposed to marijuana exhibit impairments in attention and impulsivity in addition to
hyperactivity. It would be important to investigate the effects of combined alcohol and
cannabinoids on habituation of other behaviors to better understand the nature of this
behavioral change.

25
The effects of both drugs on emotional development are more complex to interpret.
Increases in locomotion and time spent in the center of the open field chamber may indicate that
the EtOH-exposed subjects are less anxious or are more inclined to take risks (Prut et al., 2003),
suggesting that developmental alcohol exposure may affect emotional development as well as
activity. However, developmental alcohol exposure did not alter the time spent in the open
versus closed arms of the elevated plus maze. Ethanol exposure itself did decrease grooming
behaviors, an ambiguous behavior as it has been interpreted as a representation of increased
or decreased anxiety levels (Rodgers et al., 1997). In contrast, subjects exposed to CP did
increase the time spent in the open arms in the elevated plus maze, suggesting that
developmental cannabinoid exposure leads to reductions in anxiety. Yet CP exposure did not
significantly affect time spent in the center of the open field. Importantly, the contexts of the
open field and elevated plus maze vary considerably and subjects were tested at different ages.
In sum, based on elevated plus maze, one could conclude that CP, but not EtOH, exposure
during the 3rd trimesters reduces anxiety, although given behaviors in the open field, one must
be cautious of making firm conclusions of the effects of both drugs on stress and emotional
development.
Moreover, both ethanol and CP, by themselves, increased thigmotaxis in the spatial
learning task. The combination produced additive effects, as subjects exposed to both drugs
were more thigmotaxic than subjects exposed to only one drug. Thigmotaxis has classically
been described as increased fear or anxiety (Barnett, 1963), but more recent research suggests
it may also represent a cognitive impairment of selection-response (Devan et al., 1999). Given
the results of the open-field activity and elevated plus maze tasks, where drug-exposed subjects
spend more time in open areas, the increased thigmotaxis among subjects could suggest a
specific difference in cognitive strategy during the spatial learning task.
Interestingly, exposure to alcohol, and not CP, during the 3rd trimester equivalent
impaired spatial learning and memory, producing longer path lengths to find the platform and

26
larger heading angles during acquisition, as well as impaired performance on the probe trial.
This spatial learning deficit is consistent with past literature from our lab and others (Berman et
al., 2000; Girard et al., 2000; Thomas et al., 2007). Subjects exposed to cannabinoids during
development did not show these same impairments; this is not consistent with some past
literature suggesting that prenatal THC can impair spatial learning and memory (O'shea et al.,
2005), although a different task was used in that study. It is also somewhat surprising, given the
high density of cannabinoid receptors in the hippocampus. Nevertheless, the current study
found no evidence that early postnatal exposure to cannabinoids influence spatial memory, nor
that cannabinoids exacerbate impairments related to developmental alcohol exposure.
Developmental alcohol exposure decreased body weights throughout behavioral testing.
Cannabinoid exposure exacerbated these body weight reductions up through subjects’ early
adolescent periods (PD 25), but did not have lasting effects. This is consistent with past clinical
(Riley et al., 2011) and preclinical data (Ryan et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2009; Thomas et al.,
2004) showing that prenatal alcohol exposure can have long-lasting effects on body weight,
whereas the effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on physical development have been
described as subtle and/or brief in past clinical reviews (Day et al., 1991a; Day et al., 1991b;
Fergusson et al., 2002; Fried et al., 1987; Huizink, 2014; Hurd et al., 2005). Similarly,
developmental alcohol exposure led to long-lasting reductions in brain weight, whereas
developmental cannabinoid exposure had no significant effects. Brain weights are a gross
measure of neuropathology; however, they indicate how devastating early alcohol may be on
development. Relatively little is known of the effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on more
precise measures of neuropathology, but is desperately needed. Future research would benefit
from detailed neuropathological analyses following combined prenatal alcohol and cannabinoid
exposure, as past research has shown that the combination can be neurotoxic when either drug
alone is not (Hansen et al., 2008).

27
The current study found limited overall sex differences in behavioral development, and
these differences were independent of developmental alcohol or cannabinoid exposure.
Previous research has shown sex-dependent effects of developmental alcohol exposure can be
found in spatial learning (Goodlett et al., 1995; Kelly et al., 1988; Zimmerberg et al., 1991),
stress responsivity (Weinberg, 1992; Weinberg et al., 2008), and neuropathology (Barron et al.,
1988; Zimmerberg et al., 1990; Zimmerberg et al., 1989), although the patterns have been
inconsistent and often sex interactions are not seen (Thomas et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2004;
Thomas et al., 2000). Similarly, sex-dependent effects of prenatal cannabis exposure have also
been reported on emotional behaviors, motor performance, and physiology (Biscaia et al., 2003;
Navarro et al., 1994; Pérez-Rosado et al., 2000; Rubino et al., 2008). In general, these studies
suggest that females may be more sensitive to the effects of prenatal drug exposure. Although
females performed worse on the Morris water maze, regardless of exposure group, no other sex
differences were observed in the present study.
There are some limitations to the present study. The dose of CP was chosen to reflect
the amount of THC consumed by women of childbearing age in the general population
(Mehmedic et al., 2010) and is based on doses used in other studies, including developmental
(Gilbert et al., 2016) and adult (Gilbert et al., 2016; LaFleur et al., 2018; Maguire et al., 2016;
Minervini et al., 2017) CP exposure. The dose of ethanol used in the current study is a wellestablished model of moderate/high binge-like third trimester exposure that historically produces
robust behavioral deficits after exposure has ceased (Idrus et al., 2011; Klintsova et al., 2002;
Ryan et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2000); the ethanol-related deficits seen in
the current study are similar to those our laboratory has observed in the past. However, followup studies should determine how the combinations of various doses of ethanol and/or
cannabinoids affect development, including sub-threshold doses of each drug. For example,
combined exposure to cannabinoids and alcohol during early postnatal development has been

28
shown to be synergistically neurotoxic, even when each drug is administered at a sub-threshold
level (Hansen et al., 2008).
Importantly, although CP-55,940 is a cannabinoid receptor agonist similar to THC, it is
not structurally chemically identical to THC. CP is more potent than THC, but the two
substances have similar peak effects, durations of action, and neurobehavioral effects
(McGregor et al., 1996). Given that cross-tolerance can develop between THC and CP, these
substances have certain characteristics in common; however, it should be noted that there may
be differences in specific mechanisms of action such as spontaneous activity, hypothermia, and
catalepsy (Fan et al., 1994), which could be partially due to CP’s shorter half-life (Fouda et al.,
1987; Grotenhermen, 2003). The CP dose used in this study is similar to a 12 mg/kg THC dose;
i.p. injections of 10 mg/kg THC in a rat produce plasma levels around 65 ng/mL (Javadi-Paydar
et al., 2018), which is consistent with human consumption levels (Desrosiers et al., 2014). Dose
ranges in rat studies are highly variable, but recent studies have used THC doses generally
ranging from 10-30 mg/kg when mimicking high potencies (Farquhar et al., 2019; Nguyen et al.,
2016; Taffe et al., 2015; Wakley et al., 2014).
In addition, although we did not directly measure body temperature, we did videotape
pup and maternal behavior and did not find any differences in behavior. In addition, during the
drug exposures, pups were removed from the dam for only a few minutes during the drug
exposure. When removed from the home cage during this time, they were maintained on a
heating pad with littermates. The mortality rates, peak blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), and
body weights of these subjects during the exposure period are explained in detail elsewhere
(Breit et al., 2018, under revision). Briefly, CP did increase peak BACs, but only among females,
one of the few sex differences we have found. CP by itself had no effect on mortality rates or
body weights during exposure, although these measures were more affected by the
combination of CP and ethanol.

29
Lastly, it is important to acknowledge that the behavioral testing utilized a within-subjects
design, where all subjects performed each behavioral task, and each test occurred at different
ages. However, the age of testing was determined based on the ontogeny of the behavior and
the developmental ages at which these tasks are sensitive to early alcohol exposure, (Idrus et
al., 2011; Osborn et al., 1998; Ryan et al., 2008) and the testing order was designed to minimize
carryover effects. Nevertheless, the present data do indicate that cannabinoid exposure may
disrupt behavioral development by itself and may exacerbate some behavioral alterations
induced by developmental alcohol exposure.

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, the current study suggests that exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids
during a period of development equivalent to late gestation may have individual, additive, and
synergistic effects on behavioral development in domain-specific manners. Only developmental
alcohol exposure impaired spatial learning and produced gross brain pathology. In contrast, only
developmental cannabinoid exposure increased time spent in the open arms of the plus maze.
However, both increased open field activity levels and increased thigmotaxis in the water maze,
with largely additive consequences. Importantly, combined exposure to alcohol and
cannabinoids may specifically impair simple learning processes, such as habituation, in a
synergistic manner. These results show that the combination of ethanol and cannabinoids can
produce more severe behavioral alterations than either drug alone, findings that have important
implications for individuals exposed to both alcohol and marijuana during gestation, including an
increased risk of behavioral problems later in life.
