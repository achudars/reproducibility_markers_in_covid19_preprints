Abstract: To reduce postharvest losses of Ponkan mandarins caused by outdated storage facilities
and preservation technology, we evaluated the preservation effect of different storage
temperatures on Ponkan mandarins (5 ± 1, 10 ± 1, 15 ± 1, and 20 ± 1 °C), and obtained a
comprehensive score using principal component analysis (PCA) to determine its suitable storage
temperature. The results indicate that, relative to the other three storage temperatures, storage at
10 °C significantly maintains high total soluble solid content, titratable acid, and vitamin C
contents; the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content
decreased and changes in the relative conductivity (REC) were suppressed; and high activities of
superoxide-dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX),
as well as high contents of total phenol and total flavonoid were maintained. The PCA and
clustering heat map results show that that the comprehensive score was the highest when stored
at 10 °C. The data indicate that the suitable storage temperature of Ponkan mandarins at 10 °C
significantly decreased MDA accumulation and reactive oxygen species metabolism, maintains
high antioxidant capacity, maintains good fruit quality and achieves good storage and
preservation effect, which is the appropriate storage temperature for Ponkan mandarins.

Ponkan mandarins (Citrus reticulata Blanco, PM) are one of the main broad-skin citrus cultivars
and are widely cultivated in Southern China. Jing'an Ponkan mandarin is a famous mandarin
variety in Jiangxi Province, characterized by a compact plant type, early fruit bearing, rounded fruit
shape, bright color, sweet taste, crisp flesh, storage resistance, and late maturity. These mandarins
are a major source of economic income for fruit growers in the Jing'an area [1].
Appropriate postharvest treatment can significantly reduce fruit loss, improve fruit quality,
and result in higher profits. However, citrus fruit may exhibit various disorders during harvest that
limit the storage period and reduce their commercial value [2]. Many factors affect the postharvest
storage of fresh fruit, such as low temperature storage, mechanical damage by harvesting and
transporting, and harvest periods [3–5]. The most common problem during the postharvest storage
of citrus is decay. Many reports indicate that the use of polyethylene film bagging [6], the
application of 1-methylcyclopropene [7], and coating with plants extracts or its main antifungal
constituents, such as cinnamaldehyde, limonene, and clove essential oil [8], during postharvest
treatment can effectively decrease the incidence of decay in citrus fruits during storage.

Storage temperature affects respiration [9], fruit texture [10], and fruit physiological
metabolism [11]. During storage, appropriate storage temperature can reduce the occurrence of
pests and diseases [12]; decrease the fruit rot rate [13]; maintain the luster and flavor of the fruit [14];
increase soluble solids (TSS) and titratable acid (TA) contents [15]; delay fruit senescence [16]; and
increase antioxidant enzyme activity and maintain higher peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT),
superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities [17]. To some extent, the
appropriate storage temperature can inhibit the accumulation of MDA content. A too high or too
low storage temperature is harmful to fruits. Therefore, determining the suitable storage
temperature for Ponkan mandarins after harvest is crucial. Studies have reported that long-term
storage of Valencia oranges at high storage temperatures of 20 and 25 °C leads to a decrease in the
flavor quality of the oranges and the accumulation of stale flavors [18]. Compared with grapefruit
stored at higher (12 °C) or lower (4 °C) temperatures, long-term storage at 8 °C at a medium
temperature can better maintain their flavor [19]. Therefore, the minimum safe temperature for
postharvest storage of citrus is suggested to be between 5 and 8 °C [20,21]. The susceptibility of
citrus fruits to chilling injury varies with cultivars. When stored in the range of 2 to 6 °C, chilling
injury may occur in grapefruit, Shamouti orange, Vorschach orange, and lemon fruit [22]. Jose et al.
also found that chilling injury reduced the appearance quality and commercial value of citrus fruits
[23]. Therefore, to determine the best storage temperature of Ponkan mandarins provides a
scientific basis for reducing fruit loss after harvest and guidance for the production and harvest of
fruit for farmers.
The suitable storage conditions of fruit cannot be reflected by a single index, but requires a
comprehensive analysis of multiple indexes. Principal component analysis (PCA) is an analysis
method that transforms multiple variables into multiple comprehensive variables. [24]. Then, the
correlation between different variables is explained by Pearson correlation analysis. In this study,
we used PCA to establish an evaluation system for the indexes related to treatments at different
storage temperatures, which could be used as a basis for comprehensively evaluating Ponkan
mandarins storage and preservation under different storage temperatures. The suitable storage
temperatures of Ponkan mandarins were screened out, providing a theoretical basis for actual
production to reduce losses and thereby help increase profit.

Fresh Ponkan mandarins were harvested at 195 days after full-bloom (DAF) stage from a
commercial orchard in the Xiangtian district of Jing'an City (Jiangxi Province, China), and
transported back to the Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Fruit and Vegetable Preservation and
Nondestructive Testing (Nanchang, Jiangxi, China) within 4 h. After sweating for 3 days, the
healthy fruits without diseases or mechanical damage and uniform in color, size, shape, and
maturity were selected for use throughout this experiment. Then, the selected fruits were randomly
separated into 4 lots, and stored at 5 ± 1 °C, 10 ± 1, 15 ± 1, and 20 ± 1 °C with a relative humidity of
85%–90% for 120 days. We selected 15 fruits every 15 days to evaluate their physiological and
biochemical indexes.

We mixed 0.5 g of sample powder with 10 mL anhydrous methanol extractant, which was
shaken evenly. After 30 min of ultrasonic extraction at 50 °C and centrifuging at 5 000 ×g for 15 min,
the supernatant was extracted twice with the same extractant at 10 mL. The residue was washed
with a small amount of anhydrous methanol and combined with the supernatant. The supernatant
was stored at -40 °C for the TPC and TFC assays.
The TPC was assayed following the Folin–Ciocalteu method reported by Goulas et al. [27] with
a few modifications. The extraction solution (0.5 mL) was mixed with FC reagent (0.5 mL) and
distilled water (5 mL). After standing for 3 min, 1 mL of sodium carbonate solution (10% m/v) was
added, and the absorbance at a wavelength of 725 nm was measured after reaction in light for 1 h.
Gallic acid was used as the standard sample to create the standard curve, and TPC is expressed as

solution (2.4 mL). After blending and reacting for 6 min, 0.3 mL of aluminum nitrate (10% m/v) was
added. Then, after reacting for another 6 min, 4 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide was added, and the
absorbance at a wavelength of 510 nm was measured after reaction in light for another 15 min.

MDA content (mmol/g) was measured using the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method described
by Dhindsa et al. [29]. We ground 1.0 g peel to a fine powder and then homogenized it in 10 mL of
50 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.8).The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20
min at 4 °C and 2 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 2 mL of TBA, heated at 100 °C for 30 min,
and then rapidly cooled. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and 3000 ×g for 20
min at 4 °C. Absorbance was measured at 450, 532, and 600 nm. MDA content was calculated as
follows: (mmol/g) = (6.45 × (A532- A600) - 0.559 × A450).

For relative conductivity, 2.0 g of peel was removed with a 1 cm diameter puncher, rinsed
twice in distilled water, and blotted dry with clean filter paper. We then added 20 mL distilled
water to the cup and immersed the surface of the peel. After 20 minutes, a conductivity meter
(DDS-307A; Rex Shanghai, China) was used to measure the initial conductivity (P0) of the sample,
and then the sample was boiled for 10 minutes to completely kill the tissue. Then, the sample was
cooled to room temperature, and the final conductivity (P1) was assayed; relative electrical
conductivity = P0/P1 × 100%.

The H2O2 content was assayed using the molybdate colorimetric method described by a H2O2
test kit built in Nanjing (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). We mixed 0.5
g peel powder after grinding with a sample machine with 9 × volume of saline according to the
ratio of weight (g):volume (mL) = 1:9. The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g. For
the remaining steps, we followed the kit instructions.
The H2O2 content was calculated as follows: (mmol/g) = (determined OD value - blank OD
value)/(standard OD value - blank OD value) × standard concentration (163 mmol/L)/sample
weight to be tested.

polyethylene glycol (PEG), 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone) and then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 30 min
at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation is the crude extract of the enzyme. We mixed 50
μL of the extraction with 200 μL of 0.5 mM H2O2 and 3.0 mL, 25 mM of guaiacol. The OD value of

extraction buffer and then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained by
centrifugation is the crude extract of the enzyme. Other steps were conducted according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. When the inhibition rate of SOD in 1 mL of tissue reaches 50%, the
corresponding SOD amount is one unit of SOD activity (U/g).

The decay rate and weight loss rate are important indexes for evaluating the storability of citrus
fruit [33]. Figure 1A illustrates the decay rate in each group was almost zero during the first 30 days
of storage. The rotten fruit appeared in 10, 15, and 20, and 5 °C groups at 45 and 75 days,
respectively. The decay rate of fruits stored at low temperature was 3.75-fold lower at the end of
storage than that of fruits stored at 20 °C. We found significant differences in each treatment group
(p < 0.01). Numerous previous studies reported that low temperature storage slows the decay of
citrus [3,34]. Low temperature storage may reduce the occurrence of fruit diseases and insect pests
[12]. In line with our findings, low temperature storage reduced the decay rate of Ponkan
mandarins.

207
208
209
210
211
212
213

The weight loss of each group increased with storage time, as shown in Figure 1B, which was
mainly caused by water loss due to transpiration. Low temperature storage was shown to
significantly reduce the weight loss of Ponkan mandarins (p < 0.01). The lowest weight loss was 3%
at 5 °C, which is 3.67-fold lower than that of at 20 °C. As some studies reported, low temperature
storage can reduce fruit weight loss rate [9,25], which may be due to the slow water transpiration of
fruits caused by low temperature, creating a relatively high humidity environment and maintaining
the moisture content of fruits.

As many studies reported, low temperature storage at a suitable temperature is beneficial to
maintaining the appearance, color [35], taste, and quality of fruits, improving the storage resistance,
and prolonging the shelf life of fruits. To some extent, the color of the fruit reflects the freshness and
quality of the fruit. The CCI of Ponkan mandarins under storage at different temperatures increased
gradually with the increase in storage time (Figure 2A). However, under low temperature storage,
the rate of CCI increase was significantly slower (p < 0.05) than at 15 or 20 °C. The value of L*
decreased slightly with the prolongation of storage time (Figure 2B). During the whole refrigeration
period, L* was lower and significant (p < 0.05) at 15 and 20 °C than at 5 and 10 °C under low
temperature storage. In this experiment, Ponkan mandarins maintained a good appearance and
luster after long storage at a suitable storage temperature. These results are consistent with those

reported in other studies [36,37]. Temperature affects the accumulation of carotenoids in citrus
fruits, thus significantly affecting its coloration. At the optimum temperature, the more the yellow
carotenoids accumulate in the pericarp, the better the color change, the higher the color index, and
the brighter the appearance.
As one of the organic acids involved in plant respiration, TA content is regarded as an
important index for evaluating the respiration rate of horticultural crops [25]. In our study, after
storage for 120 days, the TA content was significantly lower at 10 °C than at 15 and 20 °C (p < 0.01)
(Figure 2A). The TA content of the fruit at 10 °C retained the initial level of 41.7%, whereas only
21.4% was retained at 20 °C. In this study, the high TA content at 10 °C may be due to the slowed
respiration rate, which delayed the degradation of TA [15].

TSS can be maintained at a high level under low temperature storage. TSS in citrus juice is
composed of acid soluble pectins, vitamins, sugars, and some soluble proteins [38]. The TSS content
of fruits treated at different temperatures increased first and then decreased during the whole
storage period. The peaks of TSS content in each treatment group differed, and then the TSS content
of each treated fruit decreased rapidly (Figure 2B). The TSS content of fruits at 10 °C was
significantly higher (p < 0.05) than other treatments (Figure 2B) during the middle and late storage
periods (60–120 days). Similar results were reported by Alhassan et al. [15] for Afourer mandarins
and Navel oranges.

VC is one of the key factors used to evaluate the quality of mandarin fruit. As shown in Figure
3A, the VC content of fruits stored at different temperatures first increased and then decreased
during the storage period. The peak times of VC content in each treatment group differed (e.g., 45
days for 10 °C and 30 days for 5, 15, and 20 °C) with the value decreasing 7.63%. The VC content
was significantly different from the other treatments in the later storage period (p < 0.05). These
results are similar to those reported by Zipora et al. [15]; the storage temperature was found to be
an important factor affecting the flavor of citrus. Therefore, determining the best minimum safe
storage temperature for each citrus variety is important.

Phenols and flavonoids are important secondary metabolites in plants. Most of them have the
capacity to scavenge free radicals and play an important role in the plant defense mechanism [39].
The contents of total phenols and flavonoids in Ponkan mandarins increased at first and then
decreased at different storage temperatures (Figures 3B, C). Total phenol content reached a peak at
45 days and then decreased (Figure 3A). The decrease at 10 °C was slower and the rate was
significantly lower than that of the other three treatments (p < 0.05). The changes in flavonoids
content were similar to that of total phenol content, reaching the peak at 60 days, then decreasing.
At 10 °C, the TFC was 1.49 times higher than that at the beginning of storage (Figure 3B), and was
significantly (p < 0.05) different from that of the other three treatments. In this study, high TPC and
TFC were maintained at 10 °C (Figures 3B, C), consistent with previous reports that low
temperature storage can maintain high levels of TPC and TFC [40]. In this study, the results
indicated that the appropriate storage temperature could improve the disease resistance of fruits by
increasing the secondary metabolites with defensive ability in fruit tissues.

The respiratory intensity of Ponkan mandarins increased under different temperature
treatments (Figure 4A). Low temperature storage significantly slowed the increase in the
respiratory rate of Ponkan mandarins, and a significant difference (p < 0.05) at 5 and 10 °C was
found between the earlier and later stage of storage and at 15 and 20 °C (p < 0.05). Similar results
were reported by Cheng et al. [41] for Annona chinensis storage; the respiratory rate of A. chinensis
storage at 4 °C was significantly lower than that at 8 °C. This is analogous to low temperature
storage, which can reduce the respiration of fruits during storage.
Active oxygen metabolism increased during storage, reactive oxygen species (ROS)

which then accelerated fruit senescence. The MDA content at the beginning of fruit storage was 1.3
mmol g-1. At the time of storage, the MDA content of the treated group increased, and that of the 10
°C group increased 3.15-fold, which was lower than the other three treatment groups, and was
significant (p < 0.05) (Figure 4B). MDA is the final product of membrane lipid peroxidation, which is
closely related to aging and is one of the direct indicators of membrane oxidative damage. These
results are similar to those reported by Wang et al. [16], where low temperature storage at 0 and 10
°C inhibited the increase in MDA content in cherry fruits compared with high temperature storage
at 20 and 30 °C. Therefore, the inhibition of MDA content may be related to the senescence and high
VC content of fruits stored at low temperature. To further understand the reason for this change, in
future analysis, we should determine the protective enzyme activity that delays lipid peroxidation
and cell aging.

The relative electrical conductivity of Ponkan mandarins increased at different storage
temperatures (Figure 4C) because the gradual senescence of fruits during storage may lead to
increased permeability of the pericarp cell membranes. After storage for 120 days, relative
conductivity was 30.1% at 10 °C, and 32.6%, 36.2%, and 39.2% for 5, 15, and 20 °C, respectively. The
relative conductivity was significantly lower (p < 0.05) at 10 °C than for the other three treatments.
Hydrogen peroxide is one of the important representatives of ROS, and its accumulation will
cause fruit senescence. During the whole storage process, the H2O2 content of Ponkan mandarins
increased first and then decreased, but increased overall (Figure 4D). At 10 °C, the increase in H2O2
content was lower compared with the initial storage, by only 1.19 times, significantly lower than the
other three treatment groups (p < 0.05). In this study, low temperature storage delayed fruit
senescence, resulting in a reduction in the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide.

The activities of POD, CAT, SOD, and APX are closely related to antioxidation and anti-aging
in plant tissues. Those enzyme activities in Ponkan mandarins increased at first and then decreased
at different storage temperatures (Figure 5).
The POD activity peaked at 30 days and then decreased rapidly (Figure 5A). The rate of
decline at 10 °C was significant (p < 0.05), which was slower than the other three treatments. The
CAT activity was significantly higher (p < 0.05; Figure 5B) at the later stage of storage at 10 °C, and
the decline rate was slower than that of the other three storage treatments. The SOD activity was
1.29 times higher than that of the initial storage (Figure 5C), and significantly higher than that of the
other three treatments (p < 0.05). APX activity decreased significantly during storage at 15 and 20 °
C compared with lower temperatures (p < 0.05; Figure 5D).

The excessive production and accumulation of ROS caused by fruit senescence destroys the
integrity of the cell membrane and reduces the storage tolerance of fruit [42,43]. The high activity of
antioxidant and defense-related enzymes can effectively reduce the accumulation of ROS and MDA,
reduce oxidative damage, delay fruit aging, and prolong storage life. As important antioxidant
enzymes, POD and SOD can prevent membrane lipid peroxidation caused by excessive active
oxygen [44,45]. CAT plays an important part in the scavenging process of ROS. As a stress reaction,
CAT usually changes with the change in ROS level. APX is the key enzyme for removing hydrogen
peroxide in chloroplasts and the main enzyme for vitamin C metabolism. In our study, the results
indicated that low temperature storage enhanced the activities of POD, CAT, SOD, and APX, and
lessened the accumulation of MDA (Figures 4 and 5). These results are consistent with those of
Wang et al. [16], where, compared with high temperature storage at 20 and 30 °C, low temperature
storage at 0 and 10°C inhibited the increase in antioxidant enzyme activities in cherry fruits.

PCA and Pearson Correlation of Different Indexes

Considering the differences in the fruit quality indices of Jing'an Ponkan mandarin under
different storage temperatures and according to the results of the previous experiments, 17 indexes
of Ponkan mandarins during postharvest storage were standardized using PCA with SPSS 20.0

software (IBM SPSS 22.0, Chicago, IL). Wang et al. [46] compared the differences among different
citrus varieties, and then established a citrus quality evaluation system using PCA as the basis for
evaluating the comprehensive quality of different citrus juices. PCA [24] was used to further
integrate and analyze the results of fruit quality indicators. By analyzing the eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix, the first two principal components (PCs) account for 83.19% of the total variance
of the data set. PC1 explained 53.622% of the variance in the data set, and PC2 explained 29.568%.
PC1 had high positive loading for weightlessness, relative conductivity, MDA content, and CCI,
and a high negative loading for TPC, VC content, and POD activity. PC2 had high positive loading
for SOD, CAT, and APX activities (Figure 6).

334
335
336
337
338

After 60 days of storage, the score dropped sharply (Figure 7), indicating that the optimal
storage time of Ponkan mandarins is 60 days. When the storage time is prolonged, the antioxidant
and anti-aging ability of the fruit gradually decreases. The comprehensive score of 10 °C storage
fruits was always the highest among the four storage temperatures, which maintained good fruit
quality. Therefore, the optimum storage temperature of Ponkan mandarins is 10 °C.

A correlation-based approach using the Pearson coefficient was used to examine the positive
and negative relationships between the indexes of Ponkan mandarins at different storage
temperatures. Significant positive correlations (in red) and negative correlations (in blue) are
displayed in Figure 8. Notably, VC content was significant negatively correlated with weight loss (r
= 0.791, p < 0.01, CCI (r = 0.647, p < 0.01)), respiratory intensity (r = 0.852, p < 0.01), and MDA
content (r = 0.837, p < 0.01). However, VC content was significantly positively correlated with TSS
content (r = 0.708, p < 0.01), TPC (r = 0.838, p < 0.01), and POD activity (r = 0.848, p < 0.01). These
results indicate that fruit quality is maintained by some antioxidants.
MDA content was significantly positively correlated with decay rate (r = 0.445, p < 0.01),
respiratory intensity (r = 0.884, p < 0.01), respiratory intensity (r = 0.976, p < 0.01) and H2O2 content
(r = 0.553, p < 0.01). However, MDA content was negatively correlated with TPC (r = 0.784, p < 0.01),
and POD activity (r = 0.724, p < 0.01). These results indicate that antioxidants and enzymes scavenge
ROS and delayed fruit senescence during storage.
We found a significantly positive correlation between H2O2 content and SOD activity (r = 0.364,
p < 0.01) and CAT activity (r = 0.352, p < 0.01). These results indicate that H2O2 induces the increase
in SOD and CAT antioxidant enzymes and scavenges ROS. This result has been confirmed: the
accumulation of H2O2 induced the increase in POD, SOD, CAT, and APX activities [44], which
scavenged ROS [37,38], reduced MDA and H2O2 content in cells, and maintained redox balance
[49].

4. Conclusions

359
360
361
362
363

In conclusion, the storage temperature of 10 °C can effectively maintain the quality of the fruit
by improving the storability of Ponkan mandarins, reducing the accumulation of MDA and H2O2,
reducing the level of ROS, maintaining high levels of defense enzyme activities, improving disease
resistance, delaying fruit aging, and prolonging shelf life. We did not delve into the molecular
mechanism of how low temperature maintains fruit quality, which requires further exploration.
