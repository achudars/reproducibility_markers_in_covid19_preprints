Abstract

8

Choanoflagellates are the closest unicellular relatives of animals (Metazoa). These tiny protists display

9

complex life histories that include sessile as well as different pelagic stages. Some choanoflagellates

10

have the ability to form colonies as well. Up until recently, these colonies have been described to consist

11

of mostly identical cells showing no spatial cell differentiation, which supported the traditional view

12

that spatial cell differentiation, leading to specific cell types in animals, evolved after the split of the last

13

common ancestor of the Choanoflagellata and Metazoa. The recent discovery of single cells in colonies

14

of the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta that exhibit unique cell morphologies challenges this

15

traditional view. We have now reanalyzed TEM serial sections, aiming to determine the degree of

16

similarity of S. rosetta cells within a rosette colony. We investigated cell morphologies and nuclear,

17

mitochondrial and food vacuole volumes of 40 individual cells from four different S. rosetta rosette

18

colonies and compared our findings to previously published data on sponge choanocytes. Our analysis

19

show that cells in a choanoflagellate colony differ from each other in respect to cell morphology and

20

content ratios of nuclei, mitochondria and food vacuoles. Furthermore, cell disparity within S. rosetta

21

colonies is higher compared to cell disparity within sponge choanocytes. Moreover, we discovered the

22

presence of plasma membrane contacts between colonial cells in addition to already described

23

intercellular bridges and filo-/pseudopodial contacts. Our findings indicate that the last common

24

ancestor of Choanoflagellata and Metazoa might have possessed plasma membrane contacts and spatial

25

cell disparity during colonial life history stages.

Introduction

32

The development from a fertilized egg cell, the so-called zygote, to an embryo made up by hundreds of

33

cells or to a juvenile and adult consisting of more than thousands to billions of cells is a hallmark of

34

animals (Metazoa). Metazoan development is a complex process that is facilitated by the highly

35

coordinated interplay of several not less complex sub-processes such as cell division (cleavage), cell-

36

cell interaction, cell migration and cell differentiation (Fairclough et al. 2013; Alberts et al. 2014; Brunet

37

and King 2017). The result of this interplay is a multicellular organism consisting of functionally

38

specialized cells, so-called cell types. Diverse cell types are described in non-bilaterian metazoans such

39

as sponges (Porifera), comb jellies (Ctenophora), Trichoplax (Placozoa) and jellyfish (Cnidaria) (Sebé-

40

Pedrós, Chomsky, et al. 2018; Sebé-Pedrós, Saudemont, et al. 2018). Many cell types of non-bilaterian

41

metazoans are multifunctional such as pinacocytes in sponges, epithelial muscle cells in cnidarians

42

(protection, contraction), and the “ocellus” in sponge larvae, a single cell that performs locomotor

43

(steering), photoreceptive and pigmentation functions (Wagner 2014). In bilaterian metazoans

44

multifunctional cells are often replaced by more specialized cell types that sometimes exert only one,

45

very specific, function (Wagner 2014).

46

Collar cells, polarized cells with an apical flagellum surrounded by a microvillar collar (Leadbeater

47

2015), are multifunctional cell types (Arendt et al. 2016; Brunet and King 2017; Arendt et al. 2019) and

48

conserved across almost all metazoans and their closest relatives, the choanoflagellates (Brunet and

49

King 2017; Laundon et al. 2019) (Figure 1A). The colony-forming choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta

50

(Dayel et al., 2011) has emerged as a promising model organism to investigate the evolutionary origin

51

of metazoan multicellularity and cell differentiation (Dayel et al. 2011; Hoffmeyer and Burkhardt 2016;

52

Booth et al. 2018). S. rosetta exhibits a complex life history including different single cell and colony

53

morphologies (Dayel et al. 2011) (Figure 1B). Rosette colony formation is induced by RIF (rosette

54

inducing factor), a sulfonolipid secreted by the bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis (Alegado et

55

al. 2012; Woznica et al. 2016). Similar to metazoans, colonies of S. rosetta form by mitotic divisions

56

from a single founder cell. Cells within a rosette colony are held together by intercellular cytoplasmatic

57

bridges, filopodia and an extracellular matrix (Dayel et al 2011; Laundon et al. 2019).

58

Whether cells of a rosette colony represent a cluster in which cells are identical to each other or colonial

59

differ from each other is still unclear. Although transcriptomic analyses have shown nearly identical

60

expression patterns for single and colonial cells in S. rosetta, (Fairclough et al. 2013), a recent study

61

described a distinct morphology of cells in some S. rosetta colonies indicating differences of cells within

62

choanoflagellate colonies (Laundon et al. 2019). Understanding whether individual cells of a

63

choanoflagellate colony are identical or different from each other is important for a better understanding

64

of the evolutionary origin of the Metazoa. There are several theories on the evolutionary origin of

65

metazoan multicellular development, cell differentiation and cell types (Fairclough et al. 2010; Sebe-

66

Pedros et al. 2017). As proposed by Ernst Haeckel under the term “Blastaea/Gastraea theory” (Haeckel

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/653519; this version posted May 30, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

67

1874), animals evolved through “…repeated self-division of [a] primary cell,…” (Haeckel 1892). In this

68

scenario, the last common ancestor of the Metazoa originated from incomplete cell division of a primary

69

single cell that formed a ball-shaped colony called a “Blastaea” consisting of identical cells (Mikhailov

70

et al. 2009). During evolution, intra-colonial division of labor led to increasing differences between cells

71

resulting in specialized cells representing distinct cell types (King 2004). In this scenario, spatial cell

72

differentiation evolved before temporal cell differentiation in the stem lineage of the Metazoa

73

(Mikhailov et al. 2009). A contradicting hypothesis was proposed by Alexey Zakhvatkin in 1949

74

(Zakhvatkin 1949). The so-called “Synzoospore theory” claimed that metazoans evolved from a

75

unicellular ancestor that showed a variety of different cell types during different life history stages.

76

According to this theory, temporal cell differentiation was already present and accompanied by spatial

77

cell differentiation in the metazoan stem lineage (Mikhailov et al. 2009).

78

In this study, we used ultrathin transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) serial sections of whole

79

rosette colonies of S. rosetta (previously published by Laundon et al. 2019) to prepare three-dimensional

80

(3D) reconstructions and measure volumes of cell bodies, nuclei, food vacuoles and mitochondria of 40

81

individual colonial cells from four colonies. We compared the cellular anatomy of colonial S. rosetta

82

cells with available data (Laundon et al. 2019) on the cellular anatomy of choanocytes of the

83

homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella carmela (Ereskovsky et al. 2017). This comparison allowed us to

84

reveal whether (1) cells in S. rosetta rosette colonies are indeed identical (presence of spatial cell

85

disparity), (2) how variable the volume ratios of different cellular organelles are within complete rosette

86

colonies (degree of spatial disparity) and (3) if a similar degree of spatial cell disparity is present in

87

sponge choanocytes (representing a distinct metazoan cell type).

Materials and Methods

90

3D reconstructions of complete S. rosetta colonies

91

A summary of the workflow is shown in Supplementary Figure 1 (S1). For our analysis, we used digital

92

image stacks of TEM sections of complete S. rosetta colonies (RC1 to RC4; n = 40 cells), previously

93

published

94

(doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7346750.v2). The image stacks were imported into AMIRA (FEI

95

Visualization Sciences Group) and aligned manually. Subsequently, the cell body and major cell

96

organelles (nucleus, mitochondria, and food vacuoles) were segmented manually. For surface

97

reconstructions, surface models were rendered from the segmented materials, numbers of polygons were

98

reduced and the surfaces were smoothened for the first time. Materials were then imported into Maya

99

(Autodesk), smoothened twice and colored for final image rendering. For volume renderings, segmented

100

materials were subtracted from the main image stack and exported as separate image stacks. Volume

101

renderings of cells and organelles were prepared using VG Studio Max 2.0 (Volume Graphics).

Surface measurements and volume calculations

103

Separated image stacks of cell bodies, nuclei, mitochondria and food vacuoles of the cells of RC1 to

104

RC4 were analyzed with Fiji. Image stacks were imported and masked to create a binary image of the

105

cell body or organelle (black) against a white background. The number of black pixels was counted and

106

the corresponding surface areas were measured on each section. Surface area analyses were conducted

107

using unsmoothed, unprocessed materials. Subsequently, surface area measurements were exported to

108

Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation) and volumes were calculated by multiplying each surface

109

value with the section thickness (RC1: 70 nm; RC2-RC4: 150 nm) and volume ratio calculations and

110

diagrams were prepared.

Results

113

Cells within rosette colonies of S. rosetta exhibit a variety of different morphologies

114

The individual cells of the four investigated rosette colonies (RC1 – RC4) exhibit a variety of

115

volumes/sizes and morphologies (Figure 2). Three-dimensional reconstructions of all cells of RC1 to

116

RC4 are depicted in Supplementary Figures S2 to S5. Many cells exhibit an ovoid morphology, slightly

117

elongated along the apical-basal axis (AB-axis) (Figure 2A). However, some cells exhibit a more

118

roundish (Figure 2B) or ovoid shape horizontally to the AB-axis (Figure 2C). Laundon et al. (2019)

119

described two cells with a distinct morphology within rosette colonies, C5 of RC3 (carrot-like cell;

120

Figure 2D) and C5 of RC4 (chili-like cell; Figure 2E) and our new reconstructions confirm these

121

findings. In addition, our results confirm the findings of Laundon et al. (2019) regarding the presence

122

of cell membrane protrusions for each cell within four different rosette colonies (n = 40 cells). All cells

123

within a rosette colony exhibit a variety of cell membrane protrusions such as filopodia, pseudopodia

124

and larger lobopodia-like protrusions that might represent pino- and/or endocytotic events (Figure 2F-

125

I).

126

In RC1 (seven cells; Supplementary Figure S2), cell volumes range from 15,9781 µm³ (C2) to 37,711

127

µm³ (C5). Five cells exhibit a more ovoid morphology. Three of these cells (C1, C2, C6) are slightly

128

elongated along the AB-axis. The other two cells (C3, C4) are elongated horizontally to the AB-axis.

129

Two cells (C5, C7) show a more roundish shape

130

In RC2 (11 cells; Supplementary Figure S3), cell volumes range from 19,1235 µm³ (C11) to 46,5795

131

µm³ (C10). Nine cells exhibit a more ovoid morphology. Eight of these cells (C1, C2, C4, C5, C6, C7,

132

C9, C10) are slightly elongated along the AB-axis. C8 is elongated horizontally to the AB-axis. Two

133

cells (C3, C11) show a more roundish shape.

134

In RC3 (12 cells; Supplementary Figure S4), cell volumes range from 10,1994 µm³ (C5) to 51,2403 µm³

135

(C7). Nine cells exhibit a more ovoid morphology. Eight of these cells (C1, C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9,

136

C11, C12) are slightly elongated along the AB-axis. As previously reported, C5 exhibits a distinct

137

slender, carrot-like morphology (Laundon et al. 2019). C4 is elongated horizontally to the AB-axis. Two

138

cells (C2, C10) are more roundish. C7, the largest cell of the colony, and C12 show an exceptional high

139

number of membrane protrusions (Supplementary Figure. 4).

140

In RC4 (10 cells; Supplementary Figure S5), cell volumes range from 13,9838 µm³ (C5) to 36,4673 µm³

141

(C8). Seven cells (C1, C3, C4, C6, C7, C9, C10) exhibit a more ovoid morphology, slightly elongated

142

along the AB-axis. As previously reported, C5 exhibits a distinct slender, chili-like morphology

143

(Laundon et al. 2019). Two cells (C2, C8), show a more roundish shape

144

Nuclear volume correlates with cell size in S. rosetta rosette colonies

145

In most cells of the four analyzed rosette colonies, the nucleus is located approximately in the middle of

146

the apical-basal axis of the cell. (Figure 3A). For the relative and absolute volume calculations all sub-

147

structures of the nucleus (the nuclear lamina, eu- and heterochromatin and the nucleolus) were included

148

(Table 1).

149

In RC1 (Figure 3B), the mean volume of the nucleus relative to the total cell volume is 14,77%. C4

150

exhibits the lowest (13,32%) and C1 the highest relative nuclear volume (16,1%). Therefore, the

151

maximum difference of the relative nuclear volumes between cells of RC1 is 2,78%. Comparing the

152

absolute nuclear volumes C2, the smallest cell, exhibits the lowest (2,417 µm³) and C5, the largest cell,

153

the highest absolute nuclear volume (5,495 µm³).

154

In RC2 (Figure 3C), the mean volume of the nucleus relative to the total cell volume is 14,95%. C7

155

exhibits the lowest (13,02%) and C9 the highest relative nuclear volume (17,45%). Therefore, the

156

maximum difference of the relative nuclear volumes between cells of RC2 is 4,43%. Comparing the

157

absolute nuclear volumes C8, the second smallest cell, exhibits the lowest (2,931 µm³) and C10, the

158

largest cell, the highest absolute nuclear volume (6,883 µm³).

159

In RC3 (Figure 3D), the mean volume of the nucleus relative to the total cell volume is 15,9%. C11

160

exhibits the lowest (12,5%) and C5, the chili-shaped cell (Laundon et al. 2019), the highest relative

161

nuclear volume (25,7%). Due to the exceptionally high nuclear volume of C5, the maximum difference

162

of the relative nuclear volumes between cells of RC3 is 13,2%. Comparing the absolute nuclear volumes

163

C5, the smallest cell, exhibits the lowest (2,622 µm³) and C7, the largest cell, the highest absolute nuclear

164

volume (8,634 µm³).

165

In RC4 (Figure 3E), the mean volume of the nucleus relative to the total cell volume is 16,32%. C6

166

exhibits the lowest (12,94%) and C5, the carrot-shaped cell (Laundon et al. 2019), the highest relative

167

nuclear volume (30,11%). As for RC3, due to the exceptionally high nuclear volume of C5, the

168

maximum difference of the relative nuclear volumes between cells of RC3 is 17,17%. Comparing the

169

absolute nuclear volumes C1, the second smallest cell, exhibits the lowest (2,81 µm³) and C2, the second

170

largest cell, the highest absolute nuclear volume (5,484 µm³).

171

In summary, a relatively strong correlation between the nuclear volume and the total cell volume can be

172

recognized (Figure 3B-E). In cells of RC1 (Figure 3B) and RC2 (Figure 3C) the correlation between

173

nuclear volume and total cell volume is strongest. However, two “outlier cells”, C5 (Figure 3D; black

174

asterisk) and C7 (Figure 3D; black arrow) are observed in RC3. In RC4, the correlation between nuclear

175

and total cell volume is the lowest among the four colonies analyzed and an exceptional outlier cell, C5,

176

is observed (Figure 3E; black asterisk). A plot of the relative mean, minimal and maximal nuclear

177

volumes against colony size indicates a higher cell disparity in larger colonies (RC2, RC3 and RC4)

178

compared to RC1 (maximum difference; Figure 3). However, intracolonial cell disparity seems not to

179

increase in a stepwise manner. The minimal and mean relative nuclear volumes do not show a high

180

variation between the colonies, most of the variation comes from the maximal relative nuclear volumes.

181

Mitochondrial volume correlates with cell size in S. rosetta rosette colonies

182

Most mitochondria in single-cell and colonial S. rosetta are organized within a network, called the

183

mitochondrial reticulum, surrounding the nucleus (Leadbeater 2015; Booth et al. 2018; Davis et al.

184

2019) (Figure 4A). Only the relative and absolute volume of mitochondria located in the cytoplasm of

185

each cell of RC1 – RC4 were regarded as functional and reconstructed (Table 2). Mitochondria

186

incorporated into food vacuoles were regarded as non-functional and were not reconstructed.

187

In RC1 (Figure 4B), the mean volume of the mitochondrial reticulum relative to the total cell volume is

188

5,81%. C6 exhibits the lowest (5,27%) and C2 the highest relative mitochondrial volume (6,34%).

189

Therefore, the maximum difference of the relative mitochondrial volumes between cells of RC1 is

190

1,09%. Comparing the absolute mitochondrial volumes, C2, the smallest cell, exhibits the lowest (1,013

191

µm³) and C5, the largest cell, the highest absolute mitochondrial volume (2,197 µm³).

192

In RC2 (Figure 4C), the mean volume of the mitochondrial reticulum relative to the total cell volume is

193

6,05%. C2 exhibits the lowest (5,05%) and C8 the highest relative mitochondrial volume (6,72%).

194

Therefore, the maximum difference of the relative mitochondrial volumes between cells of RC2 is

195

1,67%. Comparing the absolute mitochondrial volumes C2, the third smallest cell, exhibits the lowest

196

(1,14 µm³) and C10, the largest cell, the highest absolute mitochondrial volume (2,83 µm³).

197

In RC3 (Figure 4D), the mean volume of the mitochondrial reticulum relative to the total cell volume is

198

6,24%. C5, the chili-shaped cell (Laundon et al. 2018), exhibits the lowest (4,68%) and C11 the highest

199

relative mitochondrial volume (6,88%). Therefore, the maximum difference of the relative

200

mitochondrial volumes between cells of RC3 is 2,2%. Comparing the absolute mitochondrial volumes,

201

C5, the smallest cell, exhibits the lowest (0,478 µm³) and C7, the largest cell, the highest absolute

202

mitochondrial volume (3,218 µm³).

203

In RC4 (Figure 4E), the mean volume of the mitochondrial reticulum relative to the total cell volume is

204

6,02 %. C5, the carrot-shaped cell (Laundon et al. 2018), exhibits the lowest (3,07 %) and C6 the highest

205

relative mitochondrial volume (6,73 %). Therefore, the maximum difference of the relative

206

mitochondrial volumes between cells of RC4 is 3,66 %. Comparing the absolute mitochondrial volumes,

207

C5, the smallest cell, exhibits the lowest (0,429 µm³) and C8, the largest cell, the highest absolute

208

mitochondrial volume (2,365 µm³).

209

In summary, our data indicate a strong correlation between the mitochondrial volume and the total cell

210

volume in cells of each colony (Figure 4B-E). A plot of the relative mean, minimal and maximal

211

mitochondrial volumes against the colony size (measured as cell number) indicates that the intracolonial

212

cell disparity increases with the size of the colony (maximum difference; Figure 4). Most of this increase

213

is due to a decrease of the relative minimal mitochondrial volume. The relative mean mitochondrial

214

volume increases only slightly with colony size. The relative maximal mitochondrial volume is lowest

215

in RC1 while almost similar in RC2, RC3 and RC4. We observed that in all colonies the majority of the

216

mitochondria of a cell are organized as one large mitochondrial reticulum and only a few solitary

217

mitochondria can be observed. However, an exact measurement of the number of mitochondria was not

218

possible due to the section thickness of 150 nm (in RC2, RC3 and RC4). This thickness in combination

219

with slight distortion artifacts from the sectioning process did not always allow reliable decisions as to

220

whether one mitochondrium is continuous from one section to another or if it ends and another one

221

begins in the following section.

222

Food vacuole volume does not correlate with cell size in S. rosetta rosette colonies

223

In most cells food vacuoles are located in the basal half along the apical-basal axis of the cell. (Figure

224

5A). In the TEM sections analyzed, food vacuoles appear in different electron densities from high (dark

225

grey) to relatively low (light grey). In between the two “extremes”, food vacuoles appear in different

226

electron densities represented by different shades of grey. The electron density might represent different

227

stages in the digestive cycle. To analyze the complete volume of food vacuoles within a cell we included

228

all recognizable food vacuoles irrespective of their electron density (Table 3).

229

In RC1 (Figure 5B), the mean volume of food vacuoles relative to the total cell volume is 4,81%. C4,

230

the largest cell, exhibits the lowest (2,19%) and C4, the second largest cell, the highest relative food

231

vacuole volume (8,3%). Therefore, the maximum difference of the relative food vacuole volumes

232

between cells of RC1 is 6,11%. Comparing the absolute food vacuole volumes, C2, the smallest cell,

233

exhibits the lowest (0,761 µm³) and C4 the highest absolute food vacuole volume (3,031 µm³).

234

In RC2 (Figure 5C), the mean volume of food vacuoles relative to the total cell volume is 6,29%. C11,

235

the smallest cell, exhibits the lowest (4,47%) and C3, the second smallest cell, the highest relative food

236

vacuole volume (7,77%). Therefore, the maximum difference of the relative food vacuole volumes

237

between cells of RC2 is 3,3%. Comparing the absolute food vacuole volumes C11, exhibits the lowest

238

(0,856 µm³) and C10, the largest cell, the highest absolute food vacuole volume (3,457 µm³).

239

In RC3 (Figure 5D), the mean volume of food vacuoles relative to the total cell volume is 7,32%. C3,

240

the third largest cell, exhibits the lowest (4,33%) and C7, the largest cell, the highest relative food

241

vacuole volume (9,68%). Therefore, the maximum difference of the relative food vacuole volumes

242

between cells of RC3 is 5,35%. Comparing the absolute food vacuole volumes C5, the smallest cell,

243

exhibits the lowest (0,808 µm³) and C7 the highest absolute food vacuole volume (4,96 µm³).

244

In RC4 (Figure 5E), the mean volume of food vacuoles relative to the total cell volume is 4,93%. C9

245

exhibits the lowest (3,61%) and C3 the highest relative food vacuole volume (6,74%). Therefore, the

246

maximum difference of the relative food vacuole volumes between cells of RC4 is 3,13%. Comparing

247

the absolute food vacuole volumes, C5, the carrot-shaped cell (Laundon et al. 2018), exhibits the lowest

248

(0,654 µm³) and C3 the highest absolute food vacuole volume (2,087 µm³).

249

In summary, our data indicate that there is only a weak correlation between food vacuole volume and

250

the total cell volume in cells of each colony (Figure 5B-E). A plot of the relative mean, minimal and

251

maximal food vacuole volumes against the colony size does not indicate that cell disparity changes with

252

the size of the colony (maximum difference; Figure 5). However, our data indicate an increase of the

253

minimal food vacuole volume with increasing cell size. An exact measurement of the number of food

254

vacuoles was not possible due to the same limitations mentioned for the measurement of the

255

mitochondrial number.

256

Quantitative analysis of cell-cell contacts reveals plasma membrane contacts in colonial cells of S.

257

rosetta

258

We found three different types of cell-cell contacts between cells in a colony (plasma membrane

259

contacts, intercellular bridges and filo-/pseudopodial contacts; Figure 6). To our surprise, we discovered

260

plasma membrane contacts between some cells of a colony (Figure 6A, B). These membrane contacts

261

are found in all four colonies and range from relatively small areas (around 100 nm length on a section)

262

up to areas of a length of more than 500 nm (length on a section). The presence of intercellular bridges

263

(Figure 6A, C) and filo-/pseudopodial contacts (Figure 6A, D) has been described earlier (Dayel et al.

264

2011; Leadbeater 2015; Laundon et al. 2019).

265

We quantified the number of the newly found plasma membrane contacts in the colonies used in this

266

study. It seems that the number of plasma membrane contacts increases with the colony size (Fig. 6E).

267

This is similar to the number of intercellular bridges (Figure 6F) and consistent with the results from

Laundon et al. (2019). The number of filopodial/pseudopodial contacts between cells within the colonies

269

seems not correlated with colony size (Figure 6G). A detailed summary of the types (intercellular

270

bridges, membrane contact and filopodial contact) and number of connections of individual cell of each

271

of the four investigated colonies is given in Table 4.

Discussion

274

In this study, we analyzed cell morphologies, volumes of cell bodies and volumes of some major

275

organelles (nucleus, mitochondria and food vacuoles) of four S. rosetta rosette colonies (40 cells in

276

total). The aims were: (1) To investigate whether cells in rosette colonies of S. rosetta are indeed

277

“identical” or if they differ from each other. (2) In case they differ from each other, to what degree do

278

they vary in terms of morphology, cell volume and organelle content? (3) To compare the intracolonial

279

cell differences to the differences within a group of choanocytes of the homoscleromorph sponge O.

280

carmela. The differences of cells within a colony are here described in a relative way using the term

281

“cell disparity” (indicated by maximum volume differences in this study). Identical cells show no

282

disparity at all, the maximum volume difference is zero. In contrast, cells with a high disparity exhibit

283

a high maximum volume difference (Fig. 7).

284

Differences in nuclear volumes indicate a higher cell disparity within rosette colonies compared

285

to sponge choanocytes

286

Size and form of the nucleus are often associated with cell division, differentiation, development and

287

pathologies such as cancer. It is thought, that changes in nuclear size and form potentially impact

288

chromatin organization, gene expression and other physiological processes of the cell (Jevtić et al.

289

2014). A study on myotube formation in human myoblasts has shown that a decrease in nuclear size is

290

correlated with altered histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and gene silencing (Rozwadowska

291

et al. 2013). The comparison of nuclear volumes of colonial cells (this study) with single cells of S.

292

rosetta (Laundon et al. 2019) shows no difference between the two life history stages. This is in

293

accordance with the almost identical transcriptomes of single cells and colonial cells of S. rosetta

294

(Fairclough et al. 2013). However, comparison of the nuclear volume data of colonial S. rosetta cells

295

with data from choanocytes of the sponge O. carmela reveals interesting differences (Laundon et al.

296

2019). The relative nuclear volume of O. carmela choanocytes (9,78%, n = 5; Figure 7A) is around one

297

third lower as the nuclear volume in cells of S. rosetta colonies (eg. RC1: 14,77%, n =7; Figure 7A)

298

Additionally, the cell disparity among O. carmela choanocytes within the same choanocyte chamber of

299

a sponge individual (maximum volume difference = 0,98%; Figure 7A) is much lower than among cells

300

within one S. rosetta colony (eg. RC1: maximum volume difference = 2,78%; Figure 7A). These

301

differences in the relative nuclear volume and cell disparity can be explained in two ways. The first

302

explanation focuses on alterations of the nuclear volume due to cell division. For example, in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/653519; this version posted May 30, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

303

demosponge Hymeniacidon sinapium, choanocytes divide every 20 to 40 hours (Shore 1971). Cells of

304

S. rosetta rosette colonies in contrast divide every 6 to 8 hours (Fairclough, Dayel, and King 2010). Due

305

to the shorter cell cycle length of choanoflagellates compared to sponges it might be that the fixed S.

306

rosetta colonies contained, by chance, more cells in the G2-phase of the cell cycle. G2-phase nuclei are

307

often larger than nuclei during for example the G1-phase (Maeshima et al. 2011). The second

308

explanation focuses on the specialized function of sponge choanocytes. Colonial choanoflagellate cells

309

have been regarded as being more or less similar meaning that they show no real division of labor as

310

present in Metazoa (Leadbeater 2015). Therefore choanoflagellate cells have to be “all-rounder” and

311

constitutively express a variety of cellular modules such as for instance a ribosome biogenesis module,

312

a flagellar module, a contractility module and a filopodia/microvilli module (Brunet and King 2017) to

313

encounter all possible functional demands. Choanocytes in contrast, existing in a multicellular organism

314

with other cell types, are specialized on only a few functions such as creating water current and food

315

uptake (Simpson 2012; Mah et al. 2014; Dunn et al. 2015). Therefore, sponge choanocytes may not

316

express a multitude of different cellular modules. Instead they might express only some modules in a

317

cell type specific manner (Brunet and King 2017) (Fig.8). The expression of fewer cellular modules

318

could be reflected by a decreased number of active genes and higher values of densely packed

319

heterochromatin resulting in a smaller relative nuclear volume. Specialization could also explain the

320

lower cell disparity in O. carmela choanocytes compared to colonial cells of S. rosetta. These arguments

321

can be tested by investigating the chromatin architecture and euchromatin/heterochromatin ratios in “all-

322

rounder” colonial cells of S. rosetta and specialized choanocytes of O. carmela.

323

Differences of mitochondrial and food vacuole volumes indicate a higher cell disparity within

324

rosette colonies compared to sponge choanocytes

325

Laundon et al. (2019) suggested, that the difference in mitochondrial number (single cells: 25,3% ±

326

5,8% vs. colonial cells: 4,3% ± 4,2%) and volume (single cells: 5,08% ± 1,14% vs. colonial cells: 6,63%

327

± 0,42 %) could be due to a higher demand on energy necessary for locomotion in single-cell S. rosetta.

328

We confirm the results from Laundon et al. (2019) regarding the relative mean volume of the

329

mitochondrial reticulum in colonial S. rosetta (RC1: 5,81%; RC2: 6,05%; RC3: 6,24%; RC4: 6,02%;

330

Figure 7B). Our reconstructions of the mitochondrial reticulum of colonial cells also support the

331

presence of a lower number of mitochondria in colonial cells (Laundon et al. 2019). However, it was

332

not possible to determine the exact number of mitochondria in cells of RC2, RC3 and RC4 due to the

333

thickness (150 nm) of the sections. It is known that mitochondrial fusion is stimulated by energy demand

334

and stress while fission may generate new organelles and facilitates quality control (Youle and Van Der

335

Bliek 2012). Limited mitochondrial fusion results in improper embryogenesis and is associated with

336

some human diseases (Chen and Chan 2010). Therefore, fusion might act as a “defense mechanism”

337

against cellular aging (Westermann 2002). Similar to our speculation on the variety of cell

338

morphologies, the absence of extensive directed locomotion and the decreasing demand for high energy

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/653519; this version posted May 30, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

339

consumption in colonies might release cells from the constraint of having a high number of active, ATP-

340

producing mitochondria. This may allow for a higher degree of mitochondrial fusion and increased

341

longevity of mitochondrial function (Chen and Chan 2010). Laundon et al. (2019) reported a large

342

difference in the mitochondrial volume of S. rosetta cells compared to choanocytes in O. carmela. We

343

also confirm these results and show that the mean relative mitochondrial volume of colonial S. rosetta

344

cells is around two times higher compared to sponge choanocytes (Figure 7B). As mentioned by

345

Laundon et al. (2019) choanocytes as specialized cells without locomotory function might not need such

346

high amounts of energy as free swimming S. rosetta cells with dual functions (food acquisition and

347

locomotion) do. Additionally, we find that the cell disparity regarding mitochondrial volumes of cells

348

within S. rosetta colonies (measured in maximum volume difference) is around 1,5 to 4,8 times higher

349

compared to disparity within O. carmela choanocytes of the same individual (Figure 7B). The high cell

350

disparity in choanoflagellate colonies could indicate early stages of “division of labor” (Bonner 2009;

351

Brunet and King 2017). Cells of a colony are connected by intracellular bridges, pseudo-/filopodia

352

(Dayel et al. 2011; Leadbeater 2015; Laundon et al. 2019) and membrane contacts (this study). Some of

353

these structures could serve in exchange of metabolic compounds and could explain that certain cells

354

within a colony can reduce the cellular volume devoted to mitochondria and increase the expression of

355

other “cellular modules” (sensu Brunet and King 2017) while others increase the mitochondrial volume

356

to cover the total energetic demands of the colony.

357

The high content of food vacuoles in sponge choanocytes (around 20,7% of total cell volume; Laundon

358

et al. 2019) compared to the lower content in single-celled (around 9,22% of total cell volume; Laundon

359

et al. 2019) and colonial (around 5,84% of total cell volume; this study) could also be explained by the

360

principle of division of labor (Figure 7C). In single cell and colonial S. rosetta the dual function (food

361

acquisition and locomotion) may demand for a trade-off between the cellular volume devoted to food

362

vacuoles and other organelles, such as mitochondria, essential for flagellar function. While important

363

for prey capture by producing a water current flagella of free-swimming single cell and colonial

364

choanoflagellates are also involved in locomotion (Leadbeater 2015). The high levels of disparity of the

365

relative food vacuole volume in the analyzed colonial cells of S. rosetta could be explained in several

366

ways. First, these differences could arise simply from random differences of bacterial engulfment of

367

individual cells. Another option is that some cells within the colony are more specialized on prey capture

368

and distribute nutrients using cell-cell contacts. Such a transient specialization of groups of cells that

369

facilitate locomotion and another group that can concentrate on prey capture might have been a key

370

innovation in the metazoan stem lineage to escape the constraints imposed by the dual flagellar function.

371

This “loss of constraints” hypothesis can be tested by analyzing the mitochondrial and food vacuole

372

volumes of single cell S. rosetta under different prey concentrations and during different life history

373

stages. Of special interest would be a comparison of the mitochondrial and food vacuole volumes

374

between sessile, thecate S. rosetta and sponge choanocytes. If the “loss of constraints” hypothesis is

375

correct, sessile S. rosetta should exhibit higher volumes of food vacuole and lower mitochondrial

376

volumes than “slow and fast swimmer” cells and therefore be more similar to choanocytes.

377

Plasma membrane contacts in S. rosetta rosette colonies

378

Cell-cell contacts and differential cell adhesion are key features during development and morphogenesis

379

of metazoan embryos (Gilbert 2013). These contacts can be established in different ways utilizing

380

intercellular bridges, filo-/pseudopodia and/or whole areas of the cell membrane. Intercellular bridges

381

have been described in S. rosetta and several colony-forming choanoflagellates (Karpov and Coupe

382

1998; Dayel et al. 2011; Leadbeater 2015; Laundon et al. 2019). They have been hypothesized to

383

function as channels for intercellular communication (Fairclough et al. 2013). It has been shown, that

384

the number of intercellular bridges increases with the size of S. rosetta colonies (Laundon et al. 2018).

385

In this study we report the presence of plasma membrane contacts between some cells of rosette colonies

386

of S. rosetta. Our data show that the total number of intercellular plasma membrane contacts is

387

comparable to the number of intercellular bridges and increases with colony size in a very similar pattern

388

as observed for intercellular bridges (Figure 6A, B, D, E). Plasma membrane contact and cell adhesion

389

in metazoans are mainly mediated by Cadherins (King et al. 2003; Cereijido et al. 2004; Halbleib and

390

Nelson 2006). Twenty-three cadherins have been found in the strictly solitary choanoflagellate

391

Monosiga brevicollis. Two of these cadherins localize in the microvillar collar and colocalize with the

392

actin cytoskeleton (Abedin and King 2008). In S. rosetta, 29 proteins containing cadherin domains have

393

been described (Nichols et al. 2012). However, the functions of these S. rosetta cadherins are still

394

unknown (Fairclough et al. 2013). Some of the cadherins are differentially expressed during different

395

stages of S. rosetta life history. Interestingly, two of these cadherins (PTSG_06458 and PTSG_06068)

396

are upregulated in colonies compared to single cells (Fairclough et al. 2013). Further investigation of

397

the spatial expression patterns of these two and other cadherins are crucial to clarify the properties and

398

potential functions of intercellular membrane contacts in colonial choanoflagellates. In contrast to

399

intercellular bridges and membrane contacts, the number of filo-/pseudopodial cell-cell contacts seems

400

not tightly correlated with the size of a colony and might be a more variable and transient type of cell-

401

cell contacts (Figure 6C, F). It remains to be examined if some more stable types of choanoflagellate

402

cell-cell contacts (intercellular bridges, plasma membrane contacts) have homologous structures in

403

metazoans and therefore might have been present in the last common ancestor of choanoflagellates and

404

metazoans.

405

Cell disparity, the evolution of metazoan cell differentiation and the last common ancestor of

406

choanoflagellates and metazoans

407

Our data indicate, that (1) cells within a colony of S. rosetta are not identical but differ in terms of cell

408

morphology, the relative volume ratios of several organelles (nucleus, mitochondria, food vacuoles) and

409

their degree of interconnectedness within the colony. However, the degree to what they differ (2) varies.

410

Colonies show a variety of cell morphologies from roundish over ovoid (along the AB-axis or horizontal

411

to the AB-axis) to two extreme morphologies, the “carrot” (RC3; Laundon et al. 2019) and the “chili”

412

cell (RC4; Laundon et al. 2019). All colonial cells show filo-, pseudo- and sometimes lobopodial

413

membrane protrusion whose numbers seem to be independent from colony size (Figure 6). A

414

comparison of the nuclear volumes indicates, that the cells in larger colonies (RC2: 11 cells; RC3: 12

415

cells; RC4: 10 cells) are more different (measured in maximal volume difference) compared to cells of

416

the small colony (RC1: 7 cells) (Figure 7A). A similar trend can be observed regarding the mitochondrial

417

volumes (Figure 7B). The volumes of food vacuoles, in contrast, seem more variable and show no

418

colony size dependent pattern (Figure 7C).

419

Our study indicates that the cell disparity increases with the size of the choanoflagellate colony. The

420

lion’s share of this cell disparity might be due to variations in metabolic processes (mitochondrial and

421

food vacuole volumes) and cell cycle phases (nuclear and cell volumes), produced by different

422

expression levels of constrictively expressed cellular modules (sensu Brunet and King 2017). The larger

423

the colony the higher the statistical probability that cells exhibit different expression levels of cellular

424

modules leading to higher degrees of cell disparity between them. Single cells for example only exhibit

425

cell disparity in time (life history) but not in space because the same single cell can only have one

426

specific identity at the time (Figure 8). A colony consisting of several cells can additionally exhibit cell

427

disparity in space since different cells can have different identities. The more cells in a colony, the more

428

cell identities can be present at the same time point leading to a higher possible cell disparity within the

429

colony (Figure 8). However, a generalization of the idea that cell disparity increases with colony size is

430

limited by the sample size investigated in this study. More S. rosetta colonies must be investigated in

431

detail to test this idea. Another aim was (3) to compare our data to previously published data on nuclear,

432

mitochondrial and food vacuole volumes in choanocytes of the homoscleromorph sponge O. carmela

433

(Laundon et al. 2019). Our comparison supports the previous finding by Laundon et al. (2019)

434

comparing three colonial S. rosetta cells to five choanocytes of O. carmela. O. carmela choanocytes

435

exhibit smaller nuclear and mitochondrial but larger food vacuole volumes compared to cells of S.

436

rosetta colonies (Laundon et al. 2019, this study; Figure 7). Additionally to these findings, we showed

437

that the maximum volume difference of each of the three organelle volumes is much lower compared to

438

colonial choanoflagellate cells (Figure 7). It seems that sponge choanocytes are not only more

439

specialized on food acquisition (high volume of food vacuoles and lower mitochondrial and nuclear

440

volumes) but also more similar to each other than individual cells in a colony of S. rosetta. Therefore,

441

choanocytes exhibit lower spatial cell disparity compared to colonial S. rosetta cells (Figure 8). Is it

442

possible to integrate this idea into an evolutionary context to explain the origin of metazoan cell types?

443

In contrast to the “Blastea/Gastrea” theory (Haeckel 1874, 1892), the Synzoospore hypothesis proposed

444

that the origin of the Metazoa corresponds to the transition from temporal to spatial cell differentiation

445

(Zakhvatkin 1949; Mikhailov et al. 2009). Zakhvatkin suggested that the last common ancestor of the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/653519; this version posted May 30, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

446

Metazoa might have been an organism that already exhibited different cell types during different life

447

history phases (temporal cell disparity and cell differentiation) as it can be seen in many protozoan taxa

448

such as S. rosetta (Mikhailov et al. 2009; Dayel et al. 2011). During evolution, this organism acquired

449

a benthic colonial or multicellular phase that was made up by cells of different cell types already present

450

in the single cell stages of the life history of this organism. Mikhailov et al. (2009) suggested that it is

451

unlikely that genetic programs of cell differentiation evolved de novo in this last common ancestor of

452

the Metazoa. Instead, pre-existing mechanisms [cell differentiation programs] were used to integrate the

453

different cell types that already occur during single cell life history phases of this organism. However,

454

we think that it is more likely that new cell types evolved within a colony by co-option of cellular

455

modules already present in cell types of single cell life history phases instead of including exactly the

456

different cell types that already exist in single cell phases of the organism’s life history. This is indicated

457

by the differences between solitary and colonial S. rosetta cells. On the basis of a detailed ultra-structural

458

study, Laundon et al. (2019) suggested that colonial cells of S. rosetta might represent a distinct cell

459

type instead of a conglomerate of identical “slow swimmer” cells. The “carrot” and “chili” cell may

460

represent distinct cell types (Laundon et al. 2019), which is supported by our finding of high cell

461

disparity in S. rosetta colonies.

462

Despite the controversy whether metazoans evolved from an ancestor exhibiting a “simple” or more

463

complex life history, two main advantages have been proposed to drive positive selection for

464

multicellularity in general. The first is an increase of size (Bonner 2009). Larger organisms/colonies

465

might experience a lower predation pressure compared to smaller organisms/colonies (intercolonial

466

competition) (Bonner 2009). However, after a certain size has been reached, cells within a colony might

467

exhibit competition for space and nutrient availability (intracolonial competition). Therefore, selection

468

might favor a better integration of cells by colonizing different “niches”, gradually becoming more

469

different from each other (increasing spatial cell disparity) and eventually are recognized as different

470

cell types. The result might have been a multicellular organism with different cell types that exhibit

471

division of labor (Bonner 2009). Our investigation of cells within S. rosetta rosette colonies shows that

472

the cells of a colony are not identical but differ from each other in terms of morphology and cell organelle

473

volumes. The increased cell disparity in colonial life history phases might have been a pre-requisite for

474

the colonization of different “intracolonial niches” by some cells leading to the evolution of division of

475

labor by the differentiation into specialized cell types in the last common ancestor of the Metazoa.

Figure 8: Hypothesis on spatial and temporal cell disparity in S. rosetta single cells, colonies and

metazoans (e.g. sponges). Three cell types are described in solitary life history stages of S. rosetta (Dayel

673

et al. 2011). Each of the solitary cell types might exhibit distinct expression levels of several constitutive

674

cellular modules (sensu Brunet and King 2017) and cell disparity varies only in time but not in space.

675

In colonial S. rosetta, cell disparity additionally varies in space. Upon increase of colony size the

676

probability in cell disparity increases. In metazoans, cell number increases tremendously leading to a

677

high degree of cell disparity. During development (and life history), cells differentiate into distinct cell

678

types that express a specific set of cellular modules. This process decreases cell disparity between cells

679

of the same cell types but increases cell disparity between cells belonging to different cell types.
