Abstract

24

Self-controlled practice schedules have been shown to enhance motor learning in several

25

contexts, but their effectiveness in structural learning tasks, where the goal is to eventually learn

26

an underlying structure or rule, is not well known. Here we examined the use of self-controlled

27

practice in a novel control interface requiring structural learning. In addition, we examined the

28

effect of ‘nudging’ – i.e., whether altering task difficulty could influence self-selected strategies,

29

and hence facilitate learning. Participants wore four inertial measurement units (IMUs) on their

30

upper body and the goal was to use motions of the upper body to move a screen cursor to

31

different targets presented on the screen. The structure in this task that had to be learned was

32

based on the fact that the signals from the IMUs were linearly mapped to the x- and y- position

33

of the cursor. Participants (N = 62) were split into 3 groups (random, self-selected, nudge) based

34

on whether they had control over the sequence in which they could practice the targets. To test

35

whether participants learned the underlying structure, participants were tested both on the trained

36

targets, as well as novel targets that were not practiced during training. Results showed that

37

during training, the self-selected group showed shorter movement times relative to the random

38

group, and both self-selected and nudge groups adopted a strategy of tending to repeat targets.

39

However, in the test phase, we found no significant differences in task performance between

40

groups, indicating that structural learning was not reliably affected by the type of practice. In

41

addition, nudging participants by adjusting task difficulty did not show any significant benefits to

42

overall learning. These results suggest that although self-controlled practice influenced practice

43

structure and facilitated learning, it did not provide any additional benefits relative to practicing

44

on a random schedule in this task.

INTRODUCTION

50

Given that practice time is often limited in real-world tasks, designing practice schedules that

51

maximize learning within a short period of training is crucial for efficient use of the learner’s

52

time and effort. A key element in this regard involves determining who is in control of the

53

practice schedule. In this context, self-controlled practice schedules - i.e. allowing the learner to

54

determine aspects of practice, has emerged as an important means by which learning can be

55

facilitated. The benefits of self-controlled practice have been shown to be fairly robust across a

56

large number of tasks and practice manipulations (1–9), and have been attributed to many

57

factors, including increased active involvement from the learner (10), increased autonomy (11–

58

13), and the role of informational processes (14).

59
60

In spite of this evidence for benefits of self-controlled practice in a large number of contexts, its

61

utility in a specific type of learning - structural learning (or schema learning) has received

62

comparatively little attention (15–17). Structural learning in the motor context involves

63

extraction of a general rule of a mapping during practice, which can then effectively be used for

64

generalization. For example, when learning how to drive, the goal of the novice driver is not to

65

learn specific movements of the steering wheel per se (e.g., turn the wheel by 90 degrees), but to

66

learn the underlying ‘structure’ or ‘rule’ of how steering wheel movements map on to the

67

movement of the car. Learning this structure is essential for generalization – i.e., being able to

68

control the car in novel situations that were never practiced during training. This type of

69

structural learning becomes even more important in the context of learning to control novel

70

assistive devices. Consider for example an amputee learning to control a prosthetic arm using

71

muscle activity or inertial measurement units (18). In this case, the underlying rule of how the

aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

72

body motion/muscle activity maps to motion of the prosthetic arm may not be as intuitive as the

73

mapping of steering wheel movements to a car’s motion; this situation places an even greater

74

emphasis on the design of efficient practice schedules to learn this mapping. It is important to

75

note that even though prior studies on self-controlled practice have used ‘transfer’ tests as a

76

measure of generalization of learning (3,5), these have been primarily used in rather well-learned

77

tasks (such as key pressing or throwing) where the underlying schema may already be present

78

through prior experience. In contrast, our focus in this study was to use a novel virtual task

79

where the structure could only be learned through practice.

80
81

One important element for enhancing structural learning is the need for variability in practice

82

conditions (15,17). However, it is unclear how this variability needs to be incorporated into the

83

practice schedule. On one hand, there is extensive evidence that practice sequences benefit from

84

contextual interference – i.e. learning is generally facilitated when task variations are distributed

85

randomly across trials, instead of being blocked together (19–21). Moreover, there is also

86

evidence that self-controlled determination of the practice sequence benefits learning (22,23).

87

However, on the other hand, these experiments with self-controlled practice schedules have been

88

typically done in the context of multiple tasks (such as different sequences), with no underlying

89

structure connecting these tasks. A feature of self-controlled learning that may be problematic

90

here is that although it may benefit autonomy, it typically reduces the random structure of

91

practice because participants tend to engage in more ‘blocked’ practice by repeating targets (24).

92

As a result, it may foster more ‘instance-based’ learning (i.e. how to solve a particular variation),

93

and may potentially be detrimental to ultimately learning the underlying rule or schema.

95

A related issue with respect to self-controlled strategies is whether learning can be further

96

enhanced by ‘nudging’ (25) – i.e. given that self-selection strategies could sometimes potentially

97

be suboptimal because participants may focus on immediate short-term gains in performance

98

over long-term learning benefits (26), is it possible to push learners to choose more optimal

99

strategies that benefit learning? In the context of motor behavior, the term ‘nudge’ is closely

100

related to the concept of ‘constraints’ (Newell, 1986) in that they both attempt to alter behavior,

101

but with the main difference being that nudges do not ‘forbid’ any options or significantly alter

102

incentives to choose one option (25). In the current context, given prior evidence that self-

103

controlled practice schedules may encourage too many repetitions of a difficult task (making it

104

similar to blocked practice), we examined the effect of nudging the learner toward more random

105

practice by manipulating task difficulty so that the perceived task difficulty across all variations

106

was similar.

107
108

In this study, we examined the effect of self-controlled practice schedules on structural learning.

109

We used a novel body-machine interface (BoMI) paradigm (27), where participants had to

110

control movements of the upper body to control a screen cursor (28). Importantly, this mapping

111

of upper body movements to cursor motion was designed to be non-intuitive so that participants

112

could only discover the structure through practice. Practice involved virtual reaching movements

113

to different targets presented on a screen. We examined whether (i) a self-selected practice

114

schedule (where participants could control which targets they reached to) was superior compared

115

to a random practice schedule where participants did not have such control, and (ii) if nudging by

116

adjusting task difficulty influenced learning relative to self-selected strategies without nudging.

METHODS

119

Participants

120

We recruited 62 healthy young adults for this experiment (33 females, 29 males; age 24  4

121

years). We obtained written informed consent from all participants prior to conducting the

122

experiment, and procedures were approved by the IRB at Northwestern University and Michigan

123

State University.

124
125

Experimental protocol

126

We utilized the experimental design and setup described in earlier studies (28,29) and summarize

127

the main points for completeness.

128
129

Four IMUs (3-space, YEI Technology, Ohio, USA) were placed, on the posterior and anterior

130

ends of the acromioclavicular joint of both sides of the body using Velcro hooks to a customized

131

vest worn by each participant. Each IMU recorded 2D (roll and yaw) orientation of the segment

132

it was attached to at a sampling rate of 50 Hz.

133
134

Participants were asked to stay seated on a chair placed 23” in front of a computer screen. The

135

chair had a backrest but participants did not have any other restrictions on motion. We performed

136

an initial calibration to map the IMU signals to the cursor. Briefly, participants performed ‘free

137

exploration’ movements with their upper body within a comfortable range of motion. We then

138

performed principal components analysis (PCA) on these data, and extracted the first 2 principal

139

components – the first controlled the x-axis motion, and the second controlled the y-axis motion.

141

Participants were asked to move their upper body in order to move a cursor and reach a target

142

presented on the computer screen as fast as possible, and as close to the center of the target as

143

possible. The circular target (radius 2.2 cm) was placed at a radial distance of 11.5 cm from the

144

screen center. The cursor had to be inside the target for 500 ms in order for the trial to be

145

completed. The next target could be selected only after the previous target was reached.

146
147

The experiment consisted of a virtual center-out reaching task divided into 11 blocks: pre-test,

148

training blocks 1-4, mid-test, training blocks 5-8, and the post-test. During the testing blocks, the

149

target appeared three times in each of eight directions (4 cardinal directions, 4 diagonals),

150

resulting in 24 trials per testing block. During the training blocks, the target appeared only along

151

the four cardinal directions, for a total of 20 trials per training block. The number of trials at each

152

target depended on the group that the participant was assigned to. The task was custom-made on

153

Matlab® software (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA).

154
155
156
157

Experimental design

158

Participants were divided into one of three groups to test three different practice schedules: 1)

159

Random (20 participants), 2) Self-selected (21 participants), 3) Nudge (21 participants). All

160

groups completed the same pre-, mid-, and post-test blocks; however, the type of training given

161

during the training blocks differed across the three groups (Fig 1).

162

163

The Random group had the four practice targets presented in a randomized manner during each

164

training block trial i.e. participants had no control over which target to practice on each trial.

165

There was also a constraint that all 4 targets had to be performed at least once before a target

166

could repeat. In the Self-selected group, participants were allowed to choose which of the four

167

training targets they wanted to move their cursor to in each trial. At the start of each trial,

168

participants were shown all 4 targets simultaneously on the screen and participants subsequently

169

decided which target they wanted to move to for that trial. In the Nudge group, participants also

170

had the choice of which target they wanted to practice moving to (similar to the Self-selected

171

group); however, the size of the targets presented on the screen differed to make the perceived

172

difficulty of all targets relatively equal (i.e. difficult targets were made larger in size, and easier

173

targets smaller in size). Based on a participant’s performance in the pre-test, we computed their

174

mean normalized Euclidean error for each of the 4 cardinal targets at 1 second into the

175

movement. Then, for training blocks 1 to 4, the target for which the error was biggest was made

176

to appear bigger than usual (25% increase in radius), and the target for which the error was

177

smallest was made to appear smaller than usual (25% decrease in radius). The remaining two

178

targets stayed at the usual size. For training blocks 5 to 8, the same procedure was repeated based

179

on the Euclidean errors from the mid-test.

Data Analysis

184

All data processing and analyses were conducted using Matlab (Mathworks® Inc., Natick, MA,

185

USA).

186
187

Task performance

188

The primary performance outcome measure was movement time, which was determined to be

189

the time it took the cursor to leave the center of the screen and reach the target successfully i.e.

190

stay inside the target for 500 ms. Reduction in movement time was an indication of improved

191

task performance. Because participants could not proceed to the next target without reaching the

192

prior target in our protocol, no spatial error metrics were computed.

193
194

A secondary performance measure was the normalized path length, which showed how quickly

195

participants learned to make smooth, straight movements of the cursor to the target. The

196

normalized path length was measured as the distance traveled by the cursor divided by the

197

straight-line distance between the screen center and the target. Reduction in normalized path

198

would indicate straighter paths, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect straight line.

199
200

Strategy

201

Since the self-selected groups were given the freedom to choose the target(s) they wanted to

202

practice on, and the Nudge group was chosen to make the ‘difficult’ target easier (by making it

203

bigger in size), we quantified the strategy that participants used by (i) calculating the number of

204

times they selected the ‘difficult’ target and (ii) calculating the probability of repeating a target

205

(which examines the degree to which practice was ‘blocked’).

208

Training. To first establish that participants improved during training, we used a 2 x 3 (Block x

209

Group) repeated measures ANOVA, where Block (Training blocks 1 & 8) was the within-

210

subjects factor and Group (Random/Self-selected/Nudge) was the between-subjects factor.

211
212

Test. To assess structural learning, we used a 3 x 3 (Block x Group) repeated measures ANOVA

213

separately on each of the performance outcome measures during the testing block. Block

214

(Pre/Mid/Post) was the within-subjects factor, and Group was the between-subjects factor. For

215

post hoc comparisons, we primarily focused on two comparisons related to our aims – (i) self-

216

selected vs. random (to examine the effect of self-controlled strategy), and (ii) self-selected vs.

217

nudge (to examine the effect of nudging).

218
219

Violations of sphericity were corrected with the Greenhouse-Geisser correction when needed.

220

Significance levels were set at P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed in JASP (30).

223
224
225

Results

226
227

Data from three participants were removed from the data analysis due to incomplete data sets or

228

errors in the calibration files. Therefore, the final sample size was 19 participants for the random

229

group, 19 for the self-selected group and 21 from the nudge group.

231

Movement Time

232

Training. Training resulted in decreases in movement time, and a group difference. There was a

233

significant main effect of block (F(1,56) = 92.74, P < .001), which indicated a decrease in

234

movement time from the first to the last block, and a main effect of group (F(2,56) = 3.165, P =

235

.050). Planned comparisons showed that the random group had longer movement times than the

236

self-selected group (P = .017), but there were no differences between the self-selected and nudge

237

groups (P = .415). The block x group interaction was not significant (F(2,56) = 2.720, P = .075).

238
239

Test. All three groups exhibited a reduction in movement time over the course of the

240

experiment, but there were no group differences (Figure 2A). There was a significant main effect

241

of block (F(1.051,58.849) = 99.6, P < .001). Post hoc tests using the Bonferroni correction

242

showed that movement time reduced significantly (P < 0.001) across the three testing blocks.

243

There was no significant main effect of group (F(2,56) = 0.016, P = .984), or block x group

244

interaction (F(2.102,58.849) = 0.046, P = .96). Splitting the movement times by target direction

245

showed similar trends in both the cardinal and diagonal directions (Figure 2B).

246
247
248

Path Length.

249

Training. Training resulted in decreases in path length, but no group differences. There was a

250

significant main effect of block (F(1,56) = 53.63, P < .001), which indicated a decrease in path

251

length from the first to the last block. The main effect of group (F(2,56) = 1.663, P = .199), and

252

the block x group interaction (F(2,56) = 1.756, P = .182) were not significant.

254

Test. Similar to the movement time results, there was a decrease in path length i.e. cursor

255

trajectories became straighter with practice, but there were no group differences (Figure 3).

256

There was a significant main effect of block (F(1.042,58.348) = 68.062, P < 0.001), indicating

257

that movement trajectories became significantly straighter over the course of testing. The main

258

effect of group (F(2,56) = 0.416, P = 0.662), and block x group interaction (F(2.084,58.348) =

259

0.183, P = 0.842) were not significant.

263

Practice Strategy in Self-controlled groups

264

For the analysis of practice strategy which involved only the self-selected and nudge groups, we

265

did not have full target sequence data from one participant in the self-selected group– therefore

266

all analyses are reported for the remaining 39 participants (18 self-selected, 21 nudge)

267
268

When we examined the probability of choosing the ‘difficult target’, we found that overall both

269

self-controlled groups showed lower than 25% probability of selection, indicating that they

270

tended to avoid the difficult targets (one sample t-test, P =.009 in blocks 1-4, P < .001 in blocks

271

5-8). There was a Block x Group interaction (F(1,37) = 7.010, P = .012). Analyses of the

272

interaction showed that the Nudge group chose the ‘difficult’ target more often initially in

273

learning and then decreased this frequency with practice, whereas the Self-selected group did not

274

have a significant change in the frequency of the selection of difficult target with practice. The

275

main effects of Block (F(1,37) = 0.371, P = .546) and Group (F(1,37) = 0.008, P = .928) were

276

not significant.

277
278

When we examined the structuring of practice (in terms of whether they chose a more ‘blocked’

279

or ‘random’ schedule), we found that overall both self-controlled groups showed more

280

repetitions than the random group (which had 0% by definition). There was a main effect of

281

block (F(1,37) = 7.212, P = .011) indicating that participants tended to block practice more

282

initially during practice (i.e. blocks 1-4) compared to later in practice (blocks 5-8). The main

283

effect of group (F(1,37) = 0.813, P =.373) and the block x group interaction (F(1,37) = 3.208, P

284

= .081) was not significant.

285
286

Finally, to examine if the practice strategy in terms of target repetitions affected performance, we

287

correlated the number of repetitions in all 8 training blocks and correlated to it the movement

288

time at the post-test. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.483, P = .002, 95% CI: [0.198

289

0.693]) indicating that more repetitions during practice (i.e. more blocked practice) was

290

associated with increased movement time (i.e. lower task performance).

DISCUSSION

295

The goal of the study was to address the role of self-controlled practice in a structural learning

296

task. Participants learned to control a novel interface which required motion of the upper body to

297

move a screen cursor to different targets. Participants trained on a set of targets, and we

298

examined structural learning during test phases that involved generalization to novel targets. We

299

examined if (i) a self-selected practice schedule resulted in better learning compared to a random

practice schedule where participants did not have control, and (ii) if nudging by adjusting task

301

difficulty influenced learning relative to a self-selected strategy without nudging.

302
303

For the first question, our results showed that although the self-controlled group exhibited shorter

304

movement times early during training, there were no statistically significant differences between

305

the random and self-controlled group during the test conditions (which was our measure of

306

structural learning). This was true both for the training and test targets, indicating that the groups

307

did not differ either in retention or generalization. One trivial possibility for these non-significant

308

results is simply that any potential differences between groups was eliminated by a ‘floor effect’

309

in terms of the performance – i.e. movement times had reduced to a minimum possible limit by

310

the end of training. However, we consider this unlikely as an explanation since the mid-tests

311

(which were done in the middle of the training session) also showed the same patterns as the

312

post-test.

313
314

These results are somewhat inconsistent with a majority of experiments on self-controlled

315

practice that have demonstrated beneficial learning effects (13,31). A critical difference from

316

these prior studies is that the current study focused on structural learning – i.e., practicing

317

variations so that the focus was not simply on improving performance in the trained tasks, but

318

also on learning the underlying structure in order to generalize to other targets. In contrast, prior

319

studies on practice sequencing with self-controlled practice have typically employed different

320

task variations, with no underlying rule or structure connecting these task variations (22,23). In

321

the context of structural learning, self-controlled practice may create a potential tradeoff –

322

participants may tend to focus excessively on improving performance on the training targets (as

323

indicated by the increased repetition and avoidance of the difficult targets in the Strategy

324

analyses), however, this focus on short-term performance may result in more ‘blocked’ practice,

325

which could negate some of the other benefits of self-controlled practice. Supporting this claim,

326

we found a positive correlation between the number of repetitions and the final movement time

327

on the post-test, indicating that participants who self-selected a more ‘blocked’ practice schedule

328

showed worse task performance in the post-test. These results suggest that self-controlled

329

practice schedules may not always be optimal in terms of practice structure, especially in the

330

context of learning novel tasks. Approaches such as ‘restricted’ self-control, where participants

331

face a mix of self-controlled and experimenter-imposed conditions may provide the optimal

332

learning environment in such cases (8)

333
334

For the second question, we used a Nudge group that was designed to follow a practice schedule

335

similar to that of the self-selected group, but with the target sizes presented during the training

336

blocks adjusted based on performance on the preceding testing block. Specifically, by making

337

the more difficult targets appear easier (and vice versa), we anticipated that we could ‘nudge’

338

participants into achieving a more even distribution of repetitions across all targets; hence,

339

addressing the issue of instance-based learning previously described. Results showed that the

340

Nudge group did successfully alter the strategy relative to the Self-selected group in terms of

341

increasing the choice of the difficult target initially in learning. However, our results showed no

342

reliable effect of this manipulation on any of the performance metrics relative to the Self-selected

343

group which was not nudged. One reason for this null result might be that we only evaluated

344

target difficulty twice during the entire practice schedule - at the onset of practice and at the

345

halfway mark (i.e. at the pre-test and mid-test). A more frequent update of task difficulty (e.g.,

16

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/789644; this version posted October 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

346

once per training block) may have been more effective to ensure that participants were practicing

347

on the most difficult target for them at that time. Also, we adjusted target sizes by a fixed amount

348

based simply on the rank-ordering of the Euclidean error (i.e. without considering the magnitude

349

of the differences). Using a more sophisticated method - for e.g. by using Fitts’ law (32) to

350

control the index of difficulty - may provide a better manipulation that is more uniform across

351

participants. Given that the Nudge group had an effect on the strategy used, this strategy of

352

‘nudging’ participants toward specific choices deserves greater attention in future motor learning

353

studies since control of the choice architecture provides a way to use the experimenter’s

354

knowledge of optimal learning strategies and guide the learner toward better strategies while still

355

retaining their autonomy.

356
357

There are a few caveats that need to be addressed –first, we did not have a yoked group in this

358

study which would have received the same order of targets as that chosen by the self-controlled

359

groups. The yoked group is considered the standard control group in several self-controlled

360

practice studies and allows for isolating the effect of ‘autonomy’; however, in the context of our

361

research question being whether it is critical for the learner to have control over the practice

362

sequence during learning, the appropriate control group is the random group which did not have

363

control over the sequence. The utility of the yoked group as a control group arises only in cases

364

where the self-control group outperforms the random group; this is because the yoked group can

365

be used to distinguish if the benefit of self-control is due to the choice of a better practice

366

sequence (in which case self-control should be similar to yoked) or the fact that the self-control

367

group has autonomy (in which case self-control should be better than yoked). However, in the

368

current study, there was no evidence of the self-control group outperforming the random group.

369

In addition, from a practical standpoint, the random group serves a better control group because

370

it would likely be the default practice schedule for learning this task. A second caveat is that our

371

measures of learning were all within the same day from pre-test to post-test, similar to an

372

‘immediate’ retention test. Although it is possible that an immediate retention test is likely

373

affected by ‘temporary’ effects indicative of a learning-performance distinction (33), these

374

temporary effects usually differentially affect one group only when the manipulation has a

375

drastic effect on performance (e.g. fatigue or guidance). In our case, the manipulation did not

376

have any effects on performance even during learning, which makes it unlikely that temporary

377

effects differentially affected one group. In any case, inference from the current work is

378

primarily about short-term ‘within-session learning’, and not about long-term retention or

379

consolidation. A third caveat was that we did not have other measures of motivation or

380

perceptions of competence (11,34), and so we have restricted our discussion mostly to task

381

performance.

382
383

In summary, we found that although self-controlled practice schedules had distinct effects on

384

practice strategy, self-controlled practice schedules did not provide any additional performance

385

benefits relative to a random experimenter-determined practice schedule in a structural learning

386

task. Understanding how to enhance structural learning of complex control interfaces may be a

387

critical step in developing better practice schedules both for novel human-computer interfaces as

388

well as for current assistive devices.
