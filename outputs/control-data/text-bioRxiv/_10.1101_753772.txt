Abstract

21

Competitive interactions among conspecifics are often resolved by assessing signals that

22

honestly indicate individual fighting ability or dominance. In territorial species, signals of

23

competitive ability are thought to function primarily during the early stages of territory

24

establishment, but recent evidence suggests that these signals continue to influence

25

interactions with floaters and neighbors well after territory establishment. Here, we examine

26

the influence of the extent of chest spotting displayed by an intruding male on the response of

27

territorial male song sparrows. We exposed males to 3-D printed models with large or small

28

spotting area coupled with conspecific playback and recorded their behavior. We also assessed

29

the response of a subset of males to both the 3-D printed models and a traditional, taxidermic

30

mount to ensure the 3-D models were a realistic stimulus. We found no differences in the

31

number of attacks or proximity to the model due to spotting area. However, territorial males

32

produced more soft songs and tended to sing fewer loud songs, both of which predict attack in

33

our population, in response to the model with less chest spotting. One possibility is that males

34

with less chest spotting elicit a stronger response because they are seen as a greater threat.

35

Based on our previous findings in this system, we think it is more likely that models with less

36

chest spotting are perceived as subordinate and therefore easier to defeat, leading to a

37

stronger response by territory holders. We found males were equally likely to attack 3-D

38

printed models and a taxidermic mount but signaled more aggressively during trials with the

39

taxidermic mount than the 3-D printed models. This suggests that birds recognized the 3-D

40

models as meaningful stimuli but that the use of 3-D printed models should be validated

41

through comparison to a traditional taxidermic mount when possible.

45

Intrasexual competition for access to mates or resources is a powerful selective force in

46

many animals. Competitive interactions can be costly, which can lead to the evolution of

47

signals that indicate dominance or fighting ability that can resolve these interactions without

48

physical fights (Smith & Parker, 1976; Smith & Price, 1973). For signaling systems to be stable,

49

the signaler must benefit from the receivers’ response and the receivers must benefit from

50

responding to the information conveyed by the signal (Searcy & Nowicki, 2005; Smith & Parker,

51

1976). Additionally the signal must be honest, meaning that cheating - exaggerating one’s level

52

of fighting ability - should occur infrequently in the population (Webster, Ligon, & Leighton,

53

2018). Reliable signals of dominance or resource holding potential are thought to be most

54

likely to evolve in species that live in groups or in species in which frequent challenges occur

55

among unfamiliar conspecifics (Rohwer, 1975, 1982; Senar, 2006). In this context, the honesty

56

of the signal is maintained by social costs because individuals signaling above their rank are

57

challenged and defeated repeatedly by group members. Once individuals are familiar with

58

each other, prior experience is expected to influence the outcome of competitive interactions

59

to a greater extent than a signal of fighting ability (Chaine, Shizuka, Block, Zhang, & Lyon, 2018;

60

Lemel & Wallin, 1993; Senar, 2006; Vedder, Schut, Magrath, & Komdeur, 2010).

61

In territorial species, signals of competitive ability are thought to only function during

62

the initial stages of territory establishment when individuals are unfamiliar with each other

63

(Lemel & Wallin, 1993; Part & Qvarnstrom, 1997; Senar, 2006). Ornaments, such as bright

64

coloration, are traits that act as signals of mate quality or fighting ability, but are not used in

65

combat with other males. For instance, natural or experimentally induced variation in male

66

ornaments is related to their ability to acquire nest sites (Part & Qvarnstrom, 1997; Pryke &

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/753772; this version posted September 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

67

Andersson, 2003a; Siefferman & Hill, 2005) or secure a high quality territory (Keyser & Hill,

68

2000). However, following territory establishment, most social interactions will occur between

69

neighbors with whom individuals are familiar and possession of a territory confers an

70

ownership advantage thought to render a phenotypic signal of resource holding potential

71

irrelevant (Rohwer, 1982; Senar, 1999). Despite this, recent studies indicate that male

72

ornaments continue to function post-territory establishment as more ornamented territory

73

holders often experience fewer intrusions from floaters and neighbors during the breeding

74

season (Chaine & Lyon, 2008; Cline, Hatt, Conroy, & Cooper, 2016; Pryke & Andersson, 2003a;

75

Pryke, Lawes, & Andersson, 2001). Additionally, male territory holders modulate their response

76

to conspecific intruders based on the intruder’s ornamentation and may either respond less

77

strongly to more ornamented males or may respond more strongly to more ornamented

78

individuals or to individuals that have ornamentation similar to their own (Chaine & Lyon, 2008;

79

Martin et al., 2016; Pryke et al., 2001). These findings suggest that ornaments remain

80

important signals of fighting ability or resource holding potential throughout the breeding

81

season. Nevertheless, relatively few studies have examined the utility of ornaments in

82

mediating social interactions post-territory establishment in species or populations with few

83

floaters (but see Cline et al. 2016).

84

Conspicuous colouration is a signal used to mediate aggressive interactions in a variety

85

of taxa including insects (Tibbetts & Dale, 2004), reptiles (Ligon & McGraw, 2016; Mafli,

86

Wakamatsu, & Roulin, 2011; Martin et al., 2016; Seddon & Hews, 2016), fish (Johnson & Fuller,

87

2015; Schweitzer, Motreuil, & Dechaume-Moncharmont, 2015), and has been especially well

88

studied in birds (reviewed in Senar, 2006; Tibbetts & Safran, 2009). In birds, conspicuous

89

colouration can be produced by feather microstructure or by the deposition of pigments, such

90

as carotenoids or melanins in feathers. Melanin-based colouration produces brown, black, and

91

reddish plumage and the role of melanin-based traits in mediating competitive interactions has

92

frequently been assessed. A number of studies have found larger or darker melanin-based

93

plumage patches are associated with higher social status in flocks (Rohwer, 1975, 1977) and

94

greater fighting ability or dominance (Chaine & Lyon, 2008; Chaine, Tjernell, Shizuka, & Lyon,

95

2011; Dunn, Whittingham, Freeman-Gallant, & DeCoste, 2008; Gonzalez, Sorci, Smith, & de

96

Lope, 2002; Santos, Scheck, & Nakagawa, 2011; Tarof, Dunn, & Whittingham, 2005). In

97

territory holding species, darker males respond more strongly to model intruders and darker

98

model intruders are subject to more attacks and are approached more quickly than lighter

99

models (Chaine & Lyon, 2008). But, darker territory holding males are themselves subject to

100

more intrusions than lighter males (Chaine & Lyon, 2008). However, the consistency of some of

101

these relationship has recently been questioned and much of this research has focused on the

102

house sparrow (Passer domesticus, Kingma et al., 2008; Sanchez-Tojar et al., 2018). Further

103

research on melanin-based ornaments in a greater variety of species and in species that are

104

territorial is needed.

105

One approach used to determine if ornaments mediate aggressive interactions is to

106

present conspecifics with one or several taxidermic mounts that vary in the size or reflectance

107

of a colour patch and record the response of the focal individual (Chaine & Lyon, 2008; Coady &

108

Dawson, 2013; Korsten, Dijkstra, & Komdeur, 2007; Pryke et al., 2001). Taxidermic mounts are

109

advantageous because they provide a consistent stimulus which can permit focusing solely on

110

the effects of colouration without confounding changes in behavior as can be seen when free

111

living individuals are manipulated or live decoys are used (Scriba & Goymann, 2008). However,

112

the use of taxidermic mounts can be problematic. Taxidermic mounts necessitate collecting

113

multiple individuals or attempting to find individuals that died from natural causes (Chaine &

114

Lyon, 2008; Laubach, Blumstein, Romero, Sampson, & Foufopoulos, 2013). Further, mounts are

115

likely to be subjected to attack during trials leading to cumulative damage over experiments or

116

they must be protected in some way which leads to a less natural stimulus. Thus, a method of

117

producing accurate models that are relatively easy to manipulate the ornamentation of or

118

replace when needed would be ideal for studies focused on colouration in a variety of taxa.

119

Recent advances in 3-D printing have allowed biologists to quickly and cheaply produce models

120

for use in field research (Bentz, Philippi, & Rosvall, 2019; Fan et al., 2018; Igic et al., 2015). The

121

advantages of 3-D printing over taxidermic models is that many copies, standardized in size and

122

shape that are resistant to attacks can be produced. While several studies have utilized 3-D

123

printed models in behavioral assays, few have compared the response of the same birds to

124

both 3-D printed and traditional taxidermic models to determine if males respond similarly to

125

both stimuli (but see Bentz et al., 2019 for a comparison of responses to 3-D models and live

126

decoys with data gathered on different individuals).

127

Male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) are territorial and possess brown spotting on

128

their breast that ranges from reddish-brown to dark brown and varies in area (hereafter

129

spotting area). The spotting is prominently displayed on the chest and is similar to spotting that

130

acts as a signal in other species (Grunst & Grunst, 2015), but relatively little research has

131

focused on the function of chest spotting in song sparrows. Male song sparrows occur in both

132

urban and rural habitats and males in urban habitats display more extensive spotting and

133

greater territorial aggression than males in rural habitat (Beck, Davies, & Sewall, 2018; Davies &

134

Sewall, 2016; Foltz et al., 2015). In rural (but not urban) habitats, territorial males with less

135

extensive spotting area are more aggressive during a simulated territorial intrusion than males

136

with more extensive spotting (Beck et al., 2018). This finding is interesting given that in other

137

species, birds with larger melanin-based ornaments are generally found to display greater

138

territorial aggression (reviewed in Santos et al., 2011; Senar, 2006).

139

In this study, our goal was to determine how chest spotting influences aggressive

140

interactions between male song sparrows. To do this, we presented territorial males with 3-D

141

printed model song sparrows painted with large or small spotting area on their chests, while

142

standardizing for spotting reflectance. A second aim of our study was to verify that 3-D printed

143

models can be used to assess territorial aggression. To this end, we also presented a subset of

144

males with a taxidermic mount of a song sparrow in addition to the 3-D models to compare

145

responses to models and mounts.

Methods

147

Subjects and study sites

148

We studied song sparrows in rural and urban habitats located in Montgomery County,

149

VA from 15-18 May 2017. For the present study the subjects were 14 male song sparrows living

150

on the Virginia Tech campus (urban habitat) and 14 males living in Heritage Park and Stroubles

151

Creek Stream Restoration Site (rural habitats). The details of the sites, including levels of

152

urbanization can be found in Davies et al. (2018). Seven of the urban birds and 1 of the rural

153

birds were banded, the rest of them were non-banded. The trials were conducted on

154

consecutive days approximately 24 hours apart to ensure the same male was sampled each

155

time. Each rural subject was tested twice in a counterbalanced order: once with a small spotting

156

area model and once with a model with large spotting area. Eleven of the urban subjects were

157

tested three times, once with a taxidermic mount, once with a small spotting area model and

158

once with a large spotting area model. The remaining three were tested two times because

159

they did not appear for the third trial: two of them were tested with the large and small-

160

spotting area model and one with the mount and the small spotting area model. One more

161

male in the urban habitat was tested only once, disappearing before the second trial. We

162

included all males that had at least two trials in our comparisons. We only tested urban males

163

with a mount, because we expected that if there is a difference in response to the 3-D models

164

relative to the taxidermic mount it would be in the direction of a lower response and using the

165

more aggressive urban males gave us a better chance to detect that difference.

166

3-D printing models

167

The original file for the model was made in Autodesk 123D app from a series of pictures

168

of a plastic bird model, and then edited using Autodesk Meshmixer and saved as a .stl file. The

169

model was designed such that there were no legs but it could be placed on the belly to stand

170

upright (see Fig. 1 and the supplementary .stl file). We printed 6 models and then painted the

171

models using acrylic paint to imitate the song sparrow plumage. Three of the models were

172

painted with small spotting area (mean ± SE, 119.28 ± 0.880 mm2, range 117.5-120.3 mm2) and

173

the other three were painted with a large spotting area 283.9 ± 45.61 mm2, range 238.3-329.5

174

mm2). We also used a taxidermic mount of a song sparrow to compare responses to the model

175

(badge area 259.62 mm2).

Stimuli and trial procedure

182

The stimulus songs were recorded from song sparrows in Blacksburg, VA or Radford, VA

183

using a Sennheiser directional microphone (ME66/K6) and Marantz PMD 660 or 661 solid state

184

recorder. We selected stimulus songs based on the quality of recording. We added a silent

185

period at the end of the song to create a 10 second playback clip using Syrinx (John Burt,

186

Seattle, WA). We made 25 different stimuli tapes from 13 different males. Each subject

187

received a single stimulus song type for all experimental conditions. The stimuli used for each

188

subject came from birds that lived at least 2 km away from the subject.

189

The trials started when a singing male was located and a brief period of playback was

190

used to identify the center of the male’s territory. The experimenter placed a tripod in the

191

center of a territory near natural perches and placed a wireless speaker (VictSing model C6) on

192

the tripod at a height of about 1 m. The taxidermic mount or the 3-D printed model was placed

193

on top of the tripod above the speaker and covered with a cloth. The speaker was connected to

194

a smartphone via Bluetooth, and the experimenter controlled the playback at a distance of

195

about 15-20m.

196

With the model or mount covered, the behavior of the male was recorded for three

197

minutes after the first response to the playback to obtain a baseline aggressive response.

198

Following the pre-model period, we paused the playback and removed the cloth by walking

199

over to the tripod and then restarted the playback. This model period of the trial lasted from

200

the first time the subject entered within a 5m radius of the model/mount (as we wanted to

201

ensure that the subjects saw the model or the mount) until either an attack (physically touching

202

the model or mount) or 5 minutes has elapsed.

203

Response measures

204

We recorded the trial using the same recording equipment as above, narrating the

205

behavior of the subject. We noted two aggressive behaviors, attacks and distance to the

206

speaker, and three aggressive signaling behaviors, loud songs, soft songs (low amplitude songs),

207

and wing waves. Loud song and soft songs were classified in the field by either CA or MLB; this

208

method has been shown to be reliable in this species (Anderson, Searcy, Peters, & Nowicki,

209

2008). Soft songs and wing waves have been shown to be reliable signals of aggression (i.e.

210

predicting a subsequent attack on a taxidermic mount) in multiple populations of this species,

211

including the present one (Açkay, Beck, & Sewall, in review Akçay, Tom, Campbell, & Beecher,

212

2013; Searcy, Akçay, Nowicki, & Beecher, 2014; Searcy, Anderson, & Nowicki, 2006).

213
214

We scanned and annotated the trial recordings using Syrinx to extract the following
information: Proportion of the trial spent within 1m of the speaker and counts of loud songs,

215

soft songs and wing waves for each period. We converted the counts into rates by dividing the

216

counts by the duration of the period to account for unequal observation durations.

217

Data analysis

218

The response variables were not normally distributed and we used non-parametric tests

219

throughout. We first asked whether the models elicited different responses than a taxidermic

220

mount in urban birds. For this, we compared the proportion of the trial within 1 m, loud song

221

rates, soft song rates and wing waves in the urban subjects that received the mount treatment

222

as well as at least one 3-D printed model (n=12). Eleven of the 12 subjects received both large

223

and small spotting area 3-D models. For these subjects we averaged their responses to these

224

models and compared the responses to mount with the responses to the 3-D printed models

225

with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For individuals that received 3 trials, we used a Friedman’s

226

test to determine if responses differed due to trial order.

227

Then we compared the responses to the small and large spotting area models using all

228

the subjects that received both stimuli (n=27). We used a permutation test to test the main

229

effect of condition (a within subject variable) and habitat (a between subject variable) and their

230

interaction using the ezPerm function in the R package ez (Lawrence, 2016). Because

231

behavioural studies frequently have issues with low statistical power, we did not perform a

232

Bonferroni correction (Nakagawa, 2004).

(MB08005B-0). We sampled 28, after-hatch year, wild, male song sparrows (Melospiza

238

melodia). Many of these birds are found in urban areas where they commonly experience

239

human disturbance. During observations, we remained 15-20 m away from the focal male

240

which should have limited our effect on his behaviour and the trials were brief, only 8 minutes

241

or until the male attacked the model. We did not capture males for this study (some were

242

previously banded for studies in past years) and thus this was a minimally invasive project.

243

Males that were previously captured were banded with one USGS metal band (size 1B) and 3

244

coloured leg bands (diameter 2.8 mm). These bands were not removed so that birds could be

245

identified in future years. Leg bands are small, lightweight, and commonly used by

246

ornithologists around the globe and should have minimal effect on a bird.

Results

249

Spotting area and male territorial aggression

250

The proportion of the trial spent within 1m of the 3-D models did not differ between the

251

small- and large-spotting area models. However, habitat had a strong effect with urban birds

252

spending more time within 1m of the models than rural birds as has been found in previous

253

studies in this population (Davies & Sewall, 2016; Foltz et al., 2015). The interaction between

254

habitat and condition was not significant (Table1, Fig 2a).

266

In the signaling variables, there was a significant difference in rates of soft songs given in

267

response to small and large spotting area models: subjects tended to give more soft songs in

268

response to the models with small spotting area. The effect of habitat approached significance

269

with urban birds tending to sing more soft songs, and the interaction effect was not significant

270

(Table 1, Fig. 2b). Loud song rates showed a tendency to differ between conditions as well with

271

subjects singing fewer loud songs to models with small spotting area (Fig. 2c). Finally, subjects

272

did not differ in their wing wave rates between conditions, but urban birds gave significantly

273

more wing waves (Fig. 2d, only one rural bird gave any wing waves).

274

Four subjects out of 27 (14.8%) attacked the model with small spotting area, whereas

275

one subject (3.7%) attacked the large spotting area models. The difference was not significant

276

by a chi-square test; χ2=1.98, p= 0.16. Two out of 11 subjects attacked the taxidermic mount

277

(18.2%).

278

Response to 3-D printed models and the taxidermic mount

279

During the pre-model period, there were significant differences between the model and

280

mount in proportion of time spent within 1 m (V=57,n=12,p=0.037): subjects spent significantly

281

less time near the speaker in the mount trials than in the model trials before the model or

282

mount was revealed. No other significant differences were detected for the pre-model period

283

(all p > 0.38). During the model presentation, there were significant differences between the

284

responses to the taxidermic mount and the 3-D models. Subjects spent more time within 1m of

285

the mount than the model (V=1, n=12, p = 0.01, Fig. 3a); sang more soft songs (V=13, n=12, p =

286

0.04, Fig. 3b), and more loud songs (V=67, n=12, p = 0.03, Fig. 3c) to the mount than to the 3-D

287

models. Rates of wing waves did not differ significantly between the mount and the 3-D

Discussion
In this study we had two aims: 1) to determine whether male song sparrows respond

297

differently to intruders based on the extent of chest spotting and 2) to determine whether a 3-

298

D printed model can be effectively used to replace taxidermic mounts to study plumage signals.

299

We found that when birds were presented with 3-D printed models with different sized

300

spotting areas, they responded with more aggressive signaling towards the models with less

301

chest spotting. We found that responses to the mount and 3-D printed models did differ

302

significantly with the taxidermic mount eliciting a stronger aggressive response though the

303

mount and 3-D models were attacked at similar rates.

304

Spotting area as a signal of aggression

305

We expected to find a difference in aggressive and signaling behaviours in response to

306

variation in spotting area. However, we only found a difference in soft songs and a trend for

307

loud songs, but no differences in attack or proximity to the model. Because spotting area is a

308

visual stimulus, relatively close approach may be necessary for assessment, leading to a lack of

309

difference between treatments. Furthermore, the lack of behavioural response by the model

310

may lead males to remain in close proximity to the model, irrespective of differences in spotting

311

area. More soft songs were produced in response to the models with less chest spotting and

312

soft songs are the most reliable signal of aggression in this species (Akçay et al., 2013; Searcy et

313

al., 2006). Similarly, models with small spotting area tended to elicit lower rates of loud songs

314

than models with large spotting area, and low rates of loud singing are predictive of physical

315

attack in our population (Akçay et al. in review). Thus, these two findings can be interpreted as

316

a difference in aggressive signaling, even though there was no difference in approach or

317

attacks.

318

A difference in responses to chest spotting size is consistent with chest spotting serving

319

as a signal reflecting status or resource holding potential in song sparrows. However, whether

320

higher aggression towards males with small spotting area means that these are perceived to be

321

a greater threat or are viewed as easier to defeat requires further testing. Subjects may

322

respond with greater intensity to small spotting models because these represents a greater

323

threat. Alternatively, subjects may respond more strongly to small spotting area models

324

because these represent a lower threat which makes investment in aggressive behaviours less

325

costly (in terms of risk of retaliation and injury) than it would be in response to a higher threat

326

opponent with a large spotting area (Pryke & Andersson, 2003a; Searcy & Beecher, 2009). We

327

think this latter explanation is more likely because urban male song sparrows have more

328

extensive chest spotting and display greater territorial aggression than rural males (Beck et al.,

329

2018; Davies & Sewall, 2016). The negative association between spotting area and territorial

330

aggression we previously found in rural males may be the result of rural males with less chest

331

spotting being frequently challenged or experiencing higher rates of intrusion, leading them to

332

resort to overt aggression more frequently to defend their territory.

333

Plumage colouration does play a key role in mediating aggressive interactions between

334

neighbors and floaters in a number of other territorial bird species, just as we have found in this

335

study. In other avian species, individuals are less likely to approach or challenge more

336

ornamented individuals or models (Pryke et al., 2001) and are more likely to challenge

337

individuals with reduced or missing ornaments (Chaine & Lyon, 2008; Cline et al., 2016; Pryke &

338

Andersson, 2003a, 2003b). Indeed, more ornamented territory holders experience lower rates

339

of intrusion by conspecific males (Pryke & Andersson, 2003b; Pryke et al., 2001) while males

340

with reduced ornaments experience much greater rates (Chaine & Lyon, 2008; Cline et al.,

341

2016). Territorial males could receive intrusions from more distant neighbors who are

342

prospecting for extra-pair mating opportunities or a higher quality territory. These individuals

343

will be less familiar with each other and a signal of fighting ability could be beneficial in this

344

context. While non-territorial “floaters” occur in island populations of song sparrows (Arcese,

345

1987), the number of floaters in our population is currently unknown and assessing the

346

occurrence of floaters as well as the size and reflectance of their chest spotting would be

347

helpful, since frequent interactions with floaters would make a signal associated with resource

348

holding potential or aggression more likely to persist in a territorial species.

349

The findings in the current study support the hypothesis that spotting area is a signal

350

used in male competitive interactions and influences receiver territorial aggression in song

351

sparrows, although the mechanism of the association between the signal and aggression is

352

unknown. To address this question, we are currently completing an experimental manipulation

353

of the spotting area in male song sparrows and assessing the behavioural and hormonal

354

consequences of these manipulations.

355

3-D printed models as a tool for behavioural assays

356

A second aim of our study was to assess the use of 3-D printed models as a replacement

357

for taxidermic mounts in behavioural assays of aggression. While the use of 3-D printed models

358

is becoming more common, relatively few studies have compared traditional taxidermic models

359

and 3-D printed ones to ensure the 3-D model provides a biologically meaningful stimulus,

360

particularly for behavioural studies (but see Bentz et al., 2019; Igic et al., 2015; Watson &

361

Francis, 2015). We found our subjects in the urban areas responded to the taxidermic mount

362

with greater territorial aggression than the 3-D printed models although they still responded to,

363

and in some cases attacked, the 3-D printed models. The attack rates of birds which were

364

tested with both 3-D models and the taxidermic mount were comparable (2 out of 11 birds

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/753772; this version posted September 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

365

attacked the mount, 3 out of 11 attacked the small-spotting 3-D model, and 1 out of 11

366

attacked the large-spotting 3-D model). Because we only had a single taxidermic mount, we

367

cannot draw strong conclusions about the equivalence or lack thereof, of 3-D models and

368

taxidermic mounts. Our results suggest researchers should validate their use of 3-D printed

369

models by comparison to more realistic taxidermic mounts.

370

Though their validity across study systems still requires testing, 3-D printed models

371

provide a very promising avenue for ecological research, including behavioural ecology. For

372

intrusion experiments, the presence of a model presents a more realistic stimulus than song

373

playback alone and can lead to stronger, and likely more realistic, behavioural and hormonal

374

responses in some species (Chantrey & Workman, 1984; Wingfield & Wada, 1989). One major

375

advantage of using 3-D printed models is the ability to manipulate shape, colour, posture, etc.

376

of the visual stimuli and therefore gain more experimental control over treatments. Another

377

advantage is that it is easy to 3-D print many models to reduce or completely avoid

378

pseudoreplication without impacting wild populations by collecting specimens for taxidermic

379

mounts (pseudoreplication was an issue in our study given we only had access to a single

380

taxidermic mount). Indeed, 3-D printing has been used with great efficacy in several recent

381

studies in birds (Fan et al., 2018; Igic et al., 2015; O'Connor, Brigham, & McKechnie, 2018) and

382

other taxa (Watson & Francis, 2015), which suggests this technique can enhance a variety of

383

ecological studies (Behm, Waite, Hsieh, & Helmus, 2018). We therefore believe that going

384

forward 3-D printing will be a major benefit for behavioural ecology.
