Abstract
TDP-43 is an RNA/DNA-binding protein of versatile physiological functions and it
is also implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease
in addition to several other implicated proteins such as mutant SOD1 and FUS etc.
Cytoplasmic mis-localization, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) due to RNA
depletion and aggregation of TDP-43 are suggested to be important TDP-43-toxicity
causing mechanisms for the ALS manifestation. So far, therapeutic options for ALS
are extremely minimal and ineffective therefore, multi-faceted approaches such as
treating the oxidative stress and inhibiting the TDP-43’s aggregation are being
actively pursued. In our recent study, an acridine imidazolium derivative compound,
AIM4, has been identified to have anti-TDP-43 aggregation propensity however, its
mechanism of inhibition is not deciphered. In this study, we have utilized
computational methods to examine binding site(s) of AIM4 in the TDP-43 structure
and have also compared its binding efficiency with several other relevant
compounds. We find that AIM4 has a binding site in the C-terminal amyloidogenic
core region of amino acids aa: 288-319, which coincides with one of the key residue
motifs that could potentially mediate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of TDP43. Importantly, alike to the previously reported effects exerted by RNA molecules,
we found that AIM4 could also inhibit the in vitro LLPS of a recombinantly purified
C-terminal fragment TDP-432C bearing an A315T familial mutation. Antagonistic
effects of AIM4 towards LLPS which is believed as the precursor process to the
TDP-43’s aggregation and the in silico prediction of a binding site of AIM4 on
TDP-43 occurring in the same region, assert that AIM4 could be an important

molecule for further investigations on TDP-43’s anti-aggregation effects with
relevance to the ALS pathogenesis.
Introduction
Aggregation of misfolded proteins into amyloid-like aggregates is a prominent
feature of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson’s disease etc. [1-5]. Amyloids
can be formed by several proteins and peptides and they are ordered aggregates
formed by conformational changes in the normally soluble proteins which thereafter
assemble into insoluble aggregates that are partially resistant to protease degradation
[1, 5-9]. The structure of amyloid aggregates consists predominantly of β-sheets
arranged in a cross-β conformation where the β-strands are arranged perpendicular
to the fiber axis [10]. Amyloid aggregates can bind to flat dyes such as thioflavin-T
and Congo red and their binding characteristically alters the spectroscopic properties
of these dyes [10-13]. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, progressive
neurodegenerative disease associated with motor neuron degeneration [14-16].
Although most of the ALS cases (~90%) are sporadic, about 5-10% of ALS cases
are familial and follow Mendelian inheritance of mutations in several genes of
which SOD1, TARDBP, C9ORF72 and FUS are prominent [5, 17-20]. About 97%
of the ALS patients harbor deposition of aggregated TAR-DNA binding protein
(TDP)-43 in the disease affected tissues [5, 21]. In addition to ALS and a subset of
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP-43), TDP-43 aggregates have also
been found to be present in many other neurodegenerative diseases including
Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease [5, 22, 23] .TDP-43 is a ubiquitously
expressed versatile RNA/DNA-binding protein and its N-terminal domain contains

two tandem RRMs (RNA recognition motifs) and nuclear localization and export
signals whereas its C-terminal region is a glycine-rich low complexity and
intrinsically disordered domain [21, 24-26]. TDP-43 participates in a variety of
cellular processes including RNA splicing, mRNA turnover, RNA trafficking,
microRNA biogenesis, translation, apoptosis, neurite outgrowth and embryo
development [2, 27, 28]. Also, TDP-43 undergoes caspase mediated abnormal Cterminal fragmentation which may enhance its aggregation in the ALS patients [29].
Notably, TDP-43 has been proposed to form prion-like self-seeding aggregates in
vitro especially from its C-terminal glycine-rich region which is highly aggregationprone [30, 31]. In fact, a fragment encompassing its RRM2 and the C-terminal
region aa: 193-414 (termed: TDP-432C) has been shown to have similar aggregation
behavior as that of the full-length TDP-43 [30]. Also, the TDP-432C aggregates
could induce aggregation of monomeric TDP-43 in cell lines via a prion-like
seeding mechanism [30]. Recently, modulation of the in vitro aggregation of TDP432C by post-translational modification and anions has been reported [32]. In
addition to TDP-432C, a peptide fragment, aa: 286-331, from the C-terminal region
of TDP-43 has also been shown to be amyloidogenic and neurotoxic [33].
Furthermore, the aa: 311-360 segment from the C-terminal region of TDP-43 has
been proposed to harbor the amyloidogenic core for inducing TDP-43 aggregation
[33-35].
Mutations in TDP-43 are associated with sporadic and familial ALS [5, 18].
Notably, most of the mutations found in the ALS patients lie in the C-terminal
domain, including the glycine-rich domain of TDP-43 [36]. A missense mutation
A315T in the C-terminal region of TDP-43 leads to familial ALS with autosomal

dominant inheritance [18, 37-39]. In fact, overexpression of the mutant human TDP43-A315T leads to alteration in the TDP-43 expression levels, function, increased
phosphorylation, fragmentation, aggregation, mitochondrial aggregation and
dysfunction, ER stress, autophagy and neurodegeneration in different models [33,
40-51]. Furthermore, in vitro studies have revealed that a peptide fragment (aa: 286331) having A315T familial mutation is also amyloidogenic and neurotoxic [33].
Also, in an in vitro study, a mutant TDP-43 A315T peptide (307-319) was found to
form an anti-parallel β-sheet structure bearing thick, long and straight fibrils and
was also found to be neurotoxic [52]. Recently, membrane-less liquid droplet-like
organelles formed by the proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains
(LCD) are being implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS [5,
53-56]. The process of formation of these membrane-less liquid droplet-like
organelles is termed as liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) [55, 57]. Proteins
containing prion-like LCDs can undergo phase-separation upon addition of salt, or
alteration in pH or temperature, through transient intermolecular interactions such as
the hydrophobic, cation- and - interactions [58]. TDP-43 contains an LCD and
can undergo LLPS in the presence of salt or due to post-translational modifications
like poly ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) [59]. Strikingly, depletion of RNA
concentration was found to enhance the LLPS of TDP-43 and in contrast increase in
the RNA to protein stoichiometry was found to prevent and also reverse the LLPS of
TDP-43 [60]. It has been proposed that LLPS is a precursor process for the
formation of terminally irreversible pathogenic aggregates of TDP-43, thus, finding
any molecules inhibitory to LLPS will be of high significance [61]. The aggregation
of TDP-43 has been proposed to cause cytotoxicity via several mechanisms such as

oxidative stress induction, mitotoxicity, vacuolar fragmentation and RNA
metabolism dyshomeostasis etc. therefore, TDP-43 is considered as an important
protein target for screening of drugs against ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies
[5, 28, 62-64]. Thus far, no effective cure or treatment exists for ALS. A small
molecule, riluzole, which is an inhibitor of glutamate mediated-excitotoxicity and
another molecule edaravone (also called radicava), a potent pyrazolone free radical
scavenger and an antioxidant, are the two FDA-approved drugs available thus far for
ALS for selected patients and these may increase survival by approximately two to
three months only [65, 66]. Current research on ALS therapeutics focuses on
strategies including pro-survival signaling of motor neurons, improving
mitochondrial function and anti-oxidant response and anti-aggregation approaches
such as using small interfering RNA and antisense oligonucleotides [5, 67, 68]. In a
recent study, towards therapeutic approach, over-expressions of the yeast cochaperone Sis1 (Hsp40) as well as its human homolog DNAJB1 could reduce the
TDP-43 toxicities respectively in the yeast cells and primary cortical neurons
thereby asserting that the modulation of chaperone activity may be a potentially
fruitful strategy to pursue towards ALS therapeutics [69]. In another approach, small
molecules like methylene blue and dimebon were found to inhibit the TDP-43
aggregation in cell lines but these unfortunately failed further in the clinical trials
[70]. In our recent study, where several imidazolium derivatives of acridine were
screened, AIM4 was found to have high anti-TDP-43 aggregation effects in the
yeast model expressing TDP-43-YFP and also in vitro as tested against a
recombinantly purified C-terminal aa: 193-414 fragment (TDP-432C) [30, 71, 72].
However, the mechanism by which AIM4 inhibits TDP-43 aggregation remains to

be elucidated thus whether it has any binding affinity to TDP-43 needs to be
determined. Also, as TDP-43 is highly aggregation-prone and needs to be
maintained in presence of denaturants, it thwarts the usage of traditional tools such
as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to determine the AIM4’s binding affinity.
Therefore, in this study computational tools like molecular docking and molecular
dynamic simulations, were used to get insights into the binding mechanism of AIM4
to TDP-43. For comparison, we examined several other acridine imidazolium
derivatives [71, 72] and a previously reported anti-TDP-43 aggregation molecule
dimebon. Dimebon has been previously shown to exhibit anti-aggregation effects on
TDP-43 in SH-SY5Y cells [70]. Another small anti-amyloidogenic molecule, DPH,
that is thus far not known to influence the TDP-43’s aggregation has also been
examined here for comparison [70]. As LLPS has been suggested to be a precursor
process for the aggregation and deposition of TDP-43 as well as many other RNA
binding proteins, therefore, we also examined whether AIM4 can inhibit the in vitro
LLPS of the TDP-432C bearing an A315T familial ALS mutation. Together, we
attempted here to investigate the potential binding site(s) of AIM4 on TDP-43 and
its potential application towards inhibiting the liquid-liquid phase separation
behavior of TDP-43 which is proposedly pathogenic for ALS.

Receptor and ligand preparation
Protein structure
In previous studies, several available structures of small segments of amyloid
forming proteins have been capitalized for the design of inhibitors of fibril
formation [73, 74]. In this study, we used a Cryo-EM determined structure of a
small fragment of ALS familial mutant A315E TDP-43 encompassing amino acids
from aa: 288-319 (PDB ID: 6N3C, originally termed as SegB) [75]. This is a
fibrillar structure of a speculated pathogenic core involved in human TDP-43
aggregation which proposedly participates in the formation of both reversible and
irreversible aggregates [75]. The different chains in the 6N3C fibril structure have
been labeled from A to T. We introduced another familial point mutation, A315T, in
the 6N3C structure, by using the Swiss PDB viewer [76] and this structure,
represented hereby as 6N3C-A315T, has been used along with the structures 6N3C

the two fibrillar structures. We also used crystal structures of the potential

structures of the tandem RRM domains (PDB ID: 4BS2, aa: 96-269) [77] and Nterminal domain (NTD) (PDB ID: 2N4P, aa: 1-89) [78] were also used for the

Ligand structure
AIM4 and other acridine-imidazolium derivatives previously examined in vitro for
its propensity of anti-aggregation effects on wild-type TDP-432C, were used as test
compounds for docking studies [71, 72]. For comparison, certain other ligands such
as dimebon and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (DPH) which have already been
tested in cellular models for their inhibitory activity on TDP-43 aggregation were
also used [70]. Structures of the available compounds available were retrieved in sdf
format from PubChem and then converted to PDB format using Open Babel [79].
For the test ligands and other ligands whose structures were not available, the
structures were first drawn using Marvin Sketch (ChemAxon), and then hydrogen
atoms were added and finally the structures were 3D-cleaned and saved in ‘.pdb’
format. Furthermore, all the ligand structures were geometrically optimized by using
Avogadro software before docking [80]. The structures of all the ligands used for
docking to TDP-43 are depicted in Figure 1.
Molecular docking
The docking studies were performed using open source software, AutoDock 4.2.
ADT (AutoDock Tool), which is a graphic user interface, was used for preparing the
protein and ligand structures for docking. ADT was also used to make the grid and

the docking parameter files [81]. The protein and ligand structures were prepared for
docking by adding gasteiger charges. Blind docking was carried out for the 6N3C,
6N3C-A315T and TDP-43 (aa: 288-319) with all the ligands. The docking space
was defined by constructing a grid box. The dimensions of the grid box were set
such that the entire protein structure could fit inside the grid box. Grid maps were
calculated for each atom type present in the ligand. The spacing between the grid
points was set to 0.669 Å. The docking parameters were set to 100 GA runs and
2,500,000 energy evaluations for each cycle. Lamarckian genetic algorithm was
used for the docking [82]. For a particular conformation of the protein, the grid and
docking parameters were maintained the same for all ligands. After analysis of the
docking results, the protein ligand complexes were generated using ADT. Docking
parameters were kept the same for the RRMs (4BS2), NTD (2N4P) and the CTD
peptide structures, as described above.
Molecular dynamics simulation
MD simulations were performed by using Desmond package of Schrodinger (D. E.
Shaw Research, New York, NY, USA) [83]. The protein-ligand complexes having
the best binding energies were used for the simulations in order to check the stability
and flexibility of the complexes. Before the simulation, each complex was optimized
with protein preparation wizard in the Maestro 11.0 (Maestro, Schrödinger, LLC,
New York, NY, 2017) by assigning proper bond orders and optimizing the hydrogen
bonds. Further, the complex structures were minimized using OPLS3 force
field[84]. PROPKA was used to determine the protonation status at pH 5.0 [85]. The
complex structures were solvated with pre-defined single point charge (SPC) water
model orthorhombic box shape (a=b=c=10Å, α=β=ϒ=90°). The entire system was

neutralized by adding proper counter ions (Na+ or Cl-). The placement of ions in the
solvated system was random. The salt, NaCl, was also added to the solvated system
at 0.30M concentration. After building the solvated system, the system was energy
minimized and relaxed using the default relaxation protocol of Desmond. This
default relaxation protocol includes two rounds of energy minimization steps and
four short MD simulation steps. The energy minimization was done by steepest
descent method with a maximum of 2000 steps with and without restraints (force
constant of 50 kcal/mol/Å on all solute atoms). The energy minimization steps
followed by four short MD simulations are: 1) 12 picoseconds MD simulation at 10
K temperature in the Berendsen NVT ensemble (constant number of particles,
volume, and temperature) with solute heavy atoms restrained (force constant of 50
kcal/mol/Å); 2) 12 picoseconds simulation at 10 K in the Berendsen NPT ensemble
(constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature) with the same restraints on
solute heavy atoms; 3) 12 picoseconds simulation in Berendsen NPT ensemble using
the same restraints on solute heavy atoms in which the temperature was raised to
300 K; and 4) a final 24 picoseconds simulation in the Berendsen NPT ensemble at
300 K without restraints [86, 87]. After relaxation of the system, production MD
simulation was performed using OPLS3 force field [84]. The temperature was kept
at 300K using Nose-Hoover chain method [88] and pressure was kept at 1 bar using
Martyna-Tobias-Klein method [89]. RESPA integrator was used for all simulations
with default values : 2.0 femtoseconds time step for bonded interaction and short
range non-bonded interactions whereas 6.0 femtoseconds time step for the longrange non-bonded interactions [90]. The production simulation was run in NPT
ensemble for either 100 or 300 ns.

MD simulation analysis
The MD simulation results were analyzed using Maestro software of Schrodinger
[91]. Simulation interactions diagram (SID) program available with the Desmond
module was used to analyze protein-ligand RMSD, protein RMSF, ligand RMSF
and protein-ligand interactions [83]. All the atoms were selected for RMSD and
RMSF calculations. All the analyses were done for the entire range of the simulation
time. At the end of the simulation, ligand binding energy (in kcal/mol) to its receptor
was calculated using MM-GBSA tool of the Prime suite of Schrodinger (Prime,
Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2017). For the energy calculation, the input
partial charge of the ligand was used instead of assigning partial charges by using
default force field. Protein residues within 5 Å distance of the ligand were allowed
to be flexible for the energy calculation [92].
Plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis
Recombinant E. coli expression plasmid pET15b-His-TDP-432C which codes for
carboxyl terminal aa: 193-414 of TDP-43, was a kind gift of Prof. Yoshiaki
Furukawa, Keio University, Japan [30]. A familial ALS-linked missense point
mutation (A315T) containing mutant TDP-432C expressing plasmid was generated
using Q5 site-directed mutagenesis system (NEB, USA) using the pET15b-His
TDP-432C plasmid as the template. The respective forward and reverse primers
used for the mutagenesis were:
5’CTTTGGTACCTTCAGCATTAATCCAGCCATGATGGCTGCCGC 3’ and
5’ATGCTGAAGGTACCAAAGTTCATCCCACCACCCATATTACTAC-3’.
These primers were designed to incorporate a KpnI restriction enzyme recognition
site (GGTACC). After DpnI digestion of the template DNA, the PCR product was

transformed into competent DH5α E. coli cells (Invitrogen, USA). Then, plasmids
were isolated from the obtained transformants and analyzed for positive KpnI
digestion to ascertain for the successful mutagenesis.
Recombinant protein expression and affinity purification
For recombinant protein expression, the pET15b-His-TDP-432C (A315T) plasmid
constructed here as described above, was first transformed into the expression
competent Rosetta 2 (DE3) E. coli cells (Novagen, USA). Expressions of the
mutant TDP-432C-A315T protein and its affinity purification was carried out
following prior published methods with minor modifications [30, 71]. Briefly, the
Rosetta 2 (DE3) cells transformed with pET15b-His-TDP-43-2C (A315T) plasmid
were induced for protein expression by addition of 1 mM IPTG to express the
mutant TDP-432C-A315T protein. Subsequently, the cells were harvested after 4
hours (O.D600nm=0.8) of induction and lysed by ultra-sonication in lysis buffer
containing 6 M guanidine HCl (GuHCl) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS), pH 7.5 and added with 1 mM PMSF. After pre-clearing of the cell debris,
the supernatant was loaded onto Ni-NTA agarose affinity chromatography column
(Qiagen, Germany) pre-equilibrated with 6 M GuHCl-PBS for affinity binding of
the His-tagged TDP-432C-A315T. The Ni-NTA column was then washed with a
buffer containing 6 M GuHCl-PBS and 10 mM imidazole to remove any nonspecifically bound proteins. Next, the bound mutant TDP-432C-A315T was eluted
with the elution buffer containing 6 M GuHCl-PBS and 250 mM imidazole.
Fractions of 500 µL each were collected and screened for the protein content by
Bradford’s method and then analyzed on 10% SDS PAGE for protein
homogeneity (Supplementary Figure S3).

Amyloid-like aggregation kinetics of TDP-432C-A315T and inhibition by AIM4
and AIM1
Before using for the aggregation, the 6M GuHCl in the protein sample was first
replaced with 4M urea. For this, the TDP-432C-A315T purified in 6M GuHCl was
first diluted 10-fold in PBS pH 7.5 which causes the precipitation of TDP-432CA315T [71]. The precipitate was then pelleted by centrifugation at 14000 x g for 10
min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded to remove GuHCl. The pellet was
then re-suspended and dissolved in 4M urea in PBS pH 7.5 and used for the
aggregation following the method as described previously [71]. For examining the
amyloid-like aggregation, the protein in 4M urea was first diluted to 400 µM final
concentration in the aggregation buffer (PBS pH 7.5, 500 μM DTT; 2.5 M urea
final) and added with 400 µM thioflavinT (ThT) and then incubated overnight with
intermittent agitation in Enspire multimode microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, USA)
maintained at 37 °C. The kinetic trend of the amyloid-like aggregation of mutant
TDP-432C-A315T was monitored by recording ThT emission fluorescence at 485
nm upon excitation at 442 nm [11, 71]. For examining their inhibitory potential
towards the aggregation of mutant TDP-432C-A315T, first 50 mM stock solutions of
the acridine imidazolium derivative compounds AIM4 and AIM1 were prepared in
25% DMSO [71, 72]. Then the compounds were added to the aggregation solution
containing 400 µM of mutant TDP-432C-A315T, at a protein: AIM4/AIM1 ratio of
1:10, 1:15 or 1:20. Any inhibition of the aggregation was examined by recording the
ThT emission fluorescence as described above.

Fluorescent labelling of mutant TDP-432C-A315T for phase separation
analysis
Recently, RNA-binding proteins like FUS & TDP-43 tagged with GFP have been
shown to undergo liquid-liquid and liquid-solid phase separation in cellular
context as well as under in vitro incubation when deprived of RNA molecules and
this process is proposed to be relevant to the pathogenesis of ALS [60]. Thus, we
examined whether AIM4 can prevent the phase separation of the recombinantly
purified mutant TDP-432C-A315T which contains one of the two RNA
recognition motifs (i.e. RRM2) from the full-length TDP-43. For this, 1.4 mM of
mutant TDP-432C-A315T in 6M guanidine HCl was incubated with TCEP in the
protein to TCEP ratio of 1:5 at room temperature for 30 minutes. Next, Alexafluor
488 C5 malemide was added to the protein to a final concentration of 14 mM
(protein: alexafluor- 1:10) and was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours.
Before analysis of phase separation/aggregation, the 6M GuHCl in the protein
sample was first replaced with 8M urea. For this, the TDP-432C in 6M GuHCl was
first diluted 10-fold in PBS pH 7.5 which causes the precipitation of TDP-432CA315T. The precipitate was then pelleted by centrifugation at 14000 x g for 10
min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded to remove GuHCl. The pellet was
then re-suspended and dissolved in 8M urea in PBS pH 7.5.
Phase separation analysis by fluorescence microscopy
For examining the phase separation, fluorescent labelled protein and unlabelled
protein were mixed in the ratio of 1:50 (alexa fluor-labelled to unlabelled) and
this protein mixture in 8M urea was diluted to 400 M final concentration in the
aggregation buffer (PBS pH 7.5, 500 μM DTT; 2.5 M urea final) and then

incubated for 5 hours. Next, the sample was examined for phase separated
condensed structures in a Leica DM2500 fluorescence microscope using the GFP
filter. Images were acquired using 10x objective lens and the presence of any
globular, green fluorescent positive structures, was interpreted as successful in
vitro phase separation of the incubated soluble TDP-432C-A315T proteins [60].
For examining its inhibitory potential towards phase separation of mutant TDP432C first 50 mM stock solutions of the acridine imidazolium derivative AIM4
was prepared in 25% DMSO. Similarly, 50 mM stock concentration of DPH and
dimebon were prepared in water. Then the compounds were added to the
aggregation solution containing 400 µM of mutant TDP-432C-A315T, at a protein:
compound ratio of 1:15. Any inhibition of the phase separation was examined by
fluorescence microscopy.

Results and discussion
Docking of AIM4 and other compounds with different known structures of
TDP-43 (PDB IDs: 6N3C, 4BS2 and 2N4P)
In our previous study, we tested several acridine imidazolium derivatives and found
that AIM4 was the most effective ligand to inhibit the in vitro aggregation of the
TDP-432C [71]. AIM4 also effectively inhibited full-length TDP-43 aggregation in
the yeast model. So far, the mechanism of AIM4 mediated anti-aggregation of TDP43 is not deciphered. Thus, in an attempt to decipher the mechanism of AIM4
mediated anti-aggregation of TDP-43, we first examined the binding of AIM4 to
several pre-determined structured of TDP-43, using molecular docking tool,

AutoDock. Recently, the structure of a C-terminal fragment of TDP-43, which has
been speculated to be a pathogenic core segment (residues 286-331 with A315E
mutation) was solved using cryo-electron microscopy (PDB ID: 6N3C). To this
fibrillar 6N3C structure we also performed another mutation to replace E by T to
generate A315T familial ALS mutation. The two structures, 6N3C and 6N3CA315T (288-319) were used for docking studies. In addition to the fibrillar structure
6N3C, we also used structures of TDP-43 tandem RRMs (PDB: 4BS2) and Nterminal region (PDB: 2N4P) for docking experiments.
We used the most effective anti-aggregation acridine derivative, AIM4, along with
two other acridine derivatives which exhibited partial inhibitory potential towards
TDP-43 aggregation, namely, AIM1 and AIM3, to carry out the docking studies
with the known structures of TDP-43. As a control, we used dimebon which has
been previously shown to inhibit the TDP-43’s aggregation in the cellular models
and also an anti-histaminergic compound diphenhydramine hydrochloride (DPH)
which did not affect the TDP-43 aggregation.
Initially, we allowed all the five ligands to bind to various TDP-43 structures by
blind docking and calculated the binding energy by AutoDock. For 6N3C and
6N3C-A315T, AIM4 exhibited better binding energy over the other four ligands
(Figure 2a and Table 1). This finding that AIM4 binds better than the other ligands
in the C-terminal region of TDP-43 correlates with the data obtained earlier on the
in vitro TDP-432C structure, which also encompasses the amino acids from 288-319
of 6N3C [71].

Next, to examine if AIM4 has any other binding sites in the TDP-43 structure, we
further performed a blind docking of all the five ligands to the structures of the
TDP-43’s tandem RRMs (aa: 96-269; PDB ID: 4BS2) [77]. The tandem RRM
region has high significance as TDP-43 interacts with the RNA molecules via the
RRMs and the RNA interaction has been reported to inhibit TDP-43 from
condensing into phase-separated liquid droplets, which are speculated to be
precursor of its terminal irreversible amyloid-like aggregation [60]. As with the Cterminal region of TDP-43, AIM4 also exhibited better binding energy in
comparison with all other ligands when docked to the tandem RRM structure
(Figure 2a and Table 1).
Additionally, the N-terminal region of TDP-43 has also been proposed to play a role
in the aggregation of TDP-43 [93]. Therefore, blind docking of the ligands were also
carried out against the available solution NMR structure of an N-terminal region (aa:
1-89; PDB ID: 2N4P) of TDP-43 (Figure 2a). We chose the best representative
conformer of 2N4P and docked it with all the ligands. In this N-terminal TDP-43
structure, dimebon yielded better docking energy than AIM4 thereby suggesting of
its better binding affinity than AIM4 to the N-terminal region (Figure 2a and Table
1). Taken together, the docking results predict that AIM4 may prefer to bind to the
aggregation prone C-terminal region of TDP-43 and the tandem RRMs over the Nterminal region.

the N-terminal region of TDP-43, dimebon and AIM3 showed better affinity that AIM4.
The energy code shows regions with docking energy ranging from low (blue) to high (red).
b. A heat map showing the docking energies of AIM4 and other ligands with short

the docking with all short peptide structures, AIM4 exhibited better binding to 5WHN
peptide. The energy code shows regions with docking energy ranging from low (blue) to
high (red).

Further, it has been established that some peptide fragments from the C-terminal low
complexity domain (LCD) of TDP-43 are able to in vitro convert into either the
characteristic amyloid structures known as the steric zipper structures or into labile
aggregates [25]. Hence, we examined the affinity of the ligands to these shorter
TDP-43 C-terminal peptides comprising of two category of peptides: First, those
capable of forming amyloid-like steric zipper structures namely, 5WKD (aa: 300306), 6CEW (aa: 321-326), 6CB9 (aa: 328-333), 6CFH (aa: 333-343), 5WIA (aa:
370-375) and 5WIQ (aa: 396-402); and Second, those capable of forming labile
aggregates, comprising of the residues 312 to 317 of TDP-43, namely, wild-type
sequence (5WHN), familial mutant sequences: A315T (5WKB), A315E (5WHP),
and phosphorylated A315T familial mutant (6CF4). For the peptides capable of
forming amyloid-like steric zippers, 5WKD, 6CEW, 6CB9, 5WIA, and 5WIQ, the
AIM4 molecule exhibited effective docking energy over the other ligands (Figure
2b and Table 2). Similarly, for the four peptides which form labile aggregates
(5WHN, 5WHP, 5WKB and 6CF4), the AIM4 molecule had better affinity than all
the other tested ligands (Figure 2b and Table 2). Among the four structures, the
docking energy of AIM4 with 5WHN was predicted to be significantly better than
that of the other ligands (-13.43 kcal/mol) with a predicted inhibition constant (Ki)
of 0.14 nM (Figure 2b and Table 2).

MD simulation suggests that AIM4 forms stable complex with 6N3C and 6N3CA315T TDP-43 (aa: 288-319)
Next, we analyzed the conformational changes of the AIM4 bound TDP-43 structure
complexes through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. First, we subjected the
complex of AIM4 with 6N3C (TDP-43 aa: 288-319 A315E mutant) to molecular
dynamics simulation for a period of 300 nanoseconds (Figure 3). The MD
simulation revealed that the trend of the mutant 6N3C-AIM4 (protein-ligand)
RMSD against the simulation time was found to plateau and the average proteinligand RMSD (2.8±0.8 Å) was nearly same as that of protein alone RMSD (2.6±0.2
Å), thereby suggesting that the complex is stable (Figure 3a). Along with RMSD,
protein-RMSF (root mean square fluctuation) and ligand-RMSF were also
monitored to assess the local residue flexibility of the protein and the atom-wise
fluctuations in the ligand (Figure 3b). Total number of contacts that were made
between the mutant A315E TDP-43 peptide and AIM4 and maintained throughout
the course of simulation time are depicted (Figure 3c). Gly-288 and Asn-291 were

found to be the key residues interacting with AIM4 throughout the simulation period
and these interactions were mediated majorly through H-bond (Figure 3d). Over the
time course of MD simulation, the protein-ligand contacts retained throughout the
simulation period, have been shown as a timeline representation of number of
contacts made by each residue with the ligand in each trajectory frame (Figure 3e).

ligand, which is represented by a darker shade of orange, according to the scale to the right
of the plot. Fibrillar structure of 6N3C contains several chains from A to T which are
appropriately labeled for its AIM4 interaction.

Next, we analyzed the MD simulation of the complex of mutant 6N3C-A315T with
AIM4 to assess the stability of the complex. The RMSD of the complex was found
to be stabilized after around 80th nanosecond (Figure 4a). The trend of the 6N3CA315T-AIM4 (protein-ligand) RMSD against simulation time showed that the
complex is stable (Figure 4a). The average protein-ligand RMSD (2.9±0.8 Å) was
nearly same as that of protein alone RMSD (2.6±0.2 Å). Protein-RMSF (root mean
square fluctuation) and ligand-RMSF were also monitored to assess the local residue
flexibility of the protein and the atom-wise fluctuations in the ligand (Figure 4b).
Total contacts which were maintained throughout the simulation time have also been
depicted (Figure 4c). Gly-288 and Phe-289 were found to be the key residues
interacting with AIM4 throughout the simulation period (Figure 4d). These
interactions were mediated majorly through hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds. Over
the time course of MD simulation, the protein-ligand contact was retained
throughout the simulation period as shown by timeline representation of number of
contacts made by each residue with the ligand in each trajectory frame (Figure 4e).
Notably, key residues for LLPS contain a GFG motif and from the results of the
simulation it is seen that glycine-288 and phenylalanine-289 are the key residues
through which AIM4 interacts.

Next, to assess the stability of the AIM4 binding to the RRMs of TDP-43 (aa: 96269; PDB ID: 4BS2) complex, MD simulation of 4BS2-AIM4 complex was carried
out for 100 nanoseconds. The RMSD plot of the protein-ligand complex did not
plateau and displayed increasing trend towards the end of simulation indicating that
the complex was not stable. Over the 100 ns of simulation period, the average
RMSD values for protein alone (6.7±2.5 Å) was observed to be very high indicating
that the protein is undergoing a large conformational change during the simulation.
Also, the high average value of protein-ligand (8.2±2.9 Å) RMSD suggested that the
4BS2-AIM4 complex is unstable (Supplementary Figure S1).
Next, we checked the stability of the 5WHN-AIM4 peptide-ligand complex, the
peptide for which AIM4 displayed maximum affinity in docking, by running MD
simulations for 100 nanoseconds. For the 5WHN-AIM4 complex, high fluctuations
were observed in the protein only and protein-ligand RMSD values indicating that
the complex is not stable. The average protein alone RMSD and the protein-ligand
RMSD were observed to be 10.1±3.5 Å and 8.7±3.7 Å, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, MD simulation studies suggest of more stable
binding of AIM4 with the mutant A315E and A315T TDP-43 aa: 288-319 structures
in comparison to the TDP-43’s tandem RRMs and the 5WHN peptide. In summary,
the results from docking and MD simulation of 6N3C-AIM4, 6N3C-A315T-AIM4,
5WHN-AIM4 and 4BS2-AIM4 suggested one binding site for AIM4 on TDP-43 in
the 288-319 region. This may be a contributing reason for the previously observed
[71] better in vitro inhibitory capability of AIM4 on the aggregation of TDP-432C.

AIM4 binding poses and the predicted inhibitor constants for AIM4 and the
other ligands with 6N3C and 6N3C-A315T TDP-43
From the MD simulation results, the binding poses and interactions of the best
efficient ligand AIM4 have been shown with the 6N3C (Frame: 300 ns) and the
mutant 6N3C-A315T TDP-43 (aa: 288-319) (Frame: 100 ns) (Figure 5). Molecular
interactions of AIM4 with 6N3C and the mutant 6N3C-A315T TDP-43 (aa: 288319) are slightly different. In case of 6N3C, the carboxylic group of AIM4 interacts
with main chain of Gly-288 and side chain of Asn-291 through hydrogen bond
whereas in 6N3C-A315T mutant TDP-43 (aa: 288-319), interactions with Gly-288
and Asn-291 remains as such and also the imidazole ring of AIM4 formed pistacking interactions with the side chain of Phe-289.
Binding free-energy calculations of 6N3C-AIM4 and 6N3C-A315T-AIM4
complexes from MD simulations
The binding free-energies of the complexes of the ligands with 6N3C or 6N3CA315T mutant TDP-43 (288-319) were averaged at the end of the simulations over
the last 25 ns using MMGBSA approach (Prime package of Schrodinger) [94]. The
average binding free energy for the AIM4 with 6N3C was found to be -52.38
kcal/mol and in case of AIM4 with 6N3C-A315T was -52.78 kcal/mol.

AIM4 also inhibits amyloid-like aggregation of TDP-432C-A315T
Since, AIM4 binding was stable with the familial mutant A315T and exhibited
better docking energy, we decided to investigate the effects of AIM4 on an ALS29

related familial mutant of TDP-43, A315T mutant of TDP-432C was generated and
examined for its in vitro aggregation kinetics. As a control, we also tested the second
best acridine TDP-432C inhibitor AIM1 for comparison. Similar to as reported for
the wild-type protein [71], TDP-432C-A315T also showed ThT fluorescence kinetics
akin to that of an amyloid-like aggregation (Figure 6). Furthermore, alike the wildtype TDP-432C protein [71], concentration-dependent inhibition of the aggregation
of TDP-432C-A315T was also observed in the presence of AIM4 and AIM1 (Figure
6).
The kinetic trend was observed to flatten to baseline at 1:15 protein: AIM4
concentration, whereas at 1:15 protein: AIM1 concentration the mutant TDP-432C
continued to exhibit amyloid-like kinetics behavior although with a relatively
prolonged lag phase as compared to the protein sample with 1:10 ratio of AIM1.
However, at its further increased concentration (1:20), AIM1 also caused complete
inhibition of the mutant TDP-432C-A315T as observed by the near base line ThT
fluorescence trend (Figure 6).

Figure 6: AIM4 inhibits amyloid-like aggregation of TDP-432C-A315T.
Inhibitions of the aggregation kinetics of the mutant TDP-432C-A315T by AIM4 & AIM1
were monitored by ThT fluorescence emission. Mutant TDP-432C-A315T (400 μM) was
incubated at 37 °C in aggregation buffer (2.5M urea-PBS), either alone or with the additions
of 1:10, 1:15 or 1:20 of AIM4 or AIM1 (protein: compound molar ratio) and the ThT
fluorescence emission intensity was recorded for 12 hours at 485 nm upon excitation at 445
nm. The additions of AIM4 and AIM1 were observed to decrease the TDP-432C-A315T’s
aggregation in concentration-dependent manners.

AIM4 can also inhibit the in vitro liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the
TDP-432C-A315T protein
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of TDP-43 is influenced by both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic residues. The (G/S)-(F/Y)-(G/S) motifs promote the phase
separation through transient interactions in several intrinsically disordered proteins
like TDP-43 [5, 95]. From our in silico studies, in the 6N3C-A315T mutant TDP-43
structure (aa: 288-319), AIM4 was predicted to interact with the major amino acids,
glycine and phenylalanine, which are proposedly involved in its pathogenic LLPS
[95]. Therefore, the effect of AIM4 on the in vitro LLPS of mutant TDP-432CA315T, that also encompasses the aa: 288-319, was checked. Several reports have

previously shown that TDP-43 and its prion-like C-terminal domain can undergo
LLPS which can be modulated by the presence of salt, RNA or post-translational
modifications like the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) [59, 60, 95, 96]. Recently,
alexafluor labelled TDP-43 has been shown to form phase separated droplets [97].
In agreement, we found that after incubation under aggregation conditions,
alexafluor labelled mutant TDP-432C-A315T underwent transition from a soluble
state to form liquid-droplets, when observed under fluorescence microscopy (Figure
7). To investigate if the acridine compounds AIM4, AIM1 or AIM3 could also
modulate the liquid-liquid phase separation behavior of TDP-432C, in vitro phase
separation assay was performed in the presence of these acridine compounds
(protein: compound molar ratio- 1:15). We observed that indeed the presence of
AIM4 inhibited the formation of liquid droplet assemblies (i.e LLPS) in the mutant
TDP-432C-A315T whereas, the samples lacking AIM4 manifested numerous liquid
droplets as previously reported by other groups (Figure 7a). When the presence of
liquid phase-separated droplets was examined, there was no visible phase separation
in the TDP-432C-A315T sample incubated along with AIM4 at 1:15 ratio of the
protein to AIM4. In comparison AIM1 could greatly reduce the number of phase
separated liquid droplets but unlike AIM4, AIM1 could not completely abrogate
LLPS (Figure 7a and 7b). Furthermore, AIM3 could not inhibit the droplet
formation of TDP-432C-A315T and instead several irregular shaped solid aggregates
were observed in presence of AIM3. Similarly, incubation of mutant TDP-432C with
DPH and dimebon also did not inhibit phase separation and rather resulted in the
formation of irregular shaped aggregates possibly suggesting Liquid-Solid phase
separation. This observation that AIM4 and not the other tested acridine compounds,

which showed the maximum inhibitory potential against TDP-432C-A315T
aggregation also lead to the decrease in the phase separation of TDP-432C-A315T,
corroborates the specificity of AIM4 binding to TDP-43. This also bears a parallel to
the ability of RNA molecules in regulating the phase separation behavior of RNA
binding prion-like proteins such as TDP-43 and FUS in a concentration-dependent
manner possibly by keeping the bound proteins in soluble state and thereby
preventing their phase separation and their consequent aggregation [60]. In fact,
injection of RNA molecules into cells has been reported to revert the protein droplet
clusters in the nucleus back into the soluble state. Earlier, it has been reported that
the A315T mutation increases the cytoplasmic mis-localization, aggregation and
toxicity of TDP-43 in neurons [98]. Taken together, our results suggest that AIM4
binds to one of the potential LLPS motifs of TDP-43 i.e the GFG motif in the
amyloidogenic region and in subsequently AIM4 helps in reducing the LLPS of
TDP-432C-A315T in vitro. Further investigations on AIM4 could potentially find its
usage as anti-LLPS agent towards RNA binding protein with relevance to ALS
therapeutics.

transition from soluble state to liquid droplets suggesting of a process termed as liquidliquid phase separation (LLPS). Mutant TDP-432C-A315T (400 µM) was incubated at 37 °C
in aggregation buffer (2.5M urea-PBS), either alone or with the additions of 1:15 (protein:

The Alexa Fluor-bound species appear as droplets as observed under fluorescence
microscopy when examined using the GFP filter. With acridine compounds, AIM3 which
affected TDP-432C aggregation to the least extent exhibited the formation of irregular solid
shaped aggregates, whereas AIM1 which moderately inhibits TDP-432C aggregation, the
formation of these liquid droplets gradually decreased and were present in far fewer
numbers in comparison with the protein sample without any inhibitor and with AIM4,
which exhibits maximum inhibitory potential to TDP-432C, the liquid droplets completely
disappeared thereby indicating a complete inhibition of LLPS. All the images were taken at
10X magnification. b. The total number of liquid droplets found in each frame of the Alexa
Fluor labelled protein without any inhibitor as well as with 1:15 (protein: compound molar
ratio) of AIM1 and AIM4 were counted. The data represents the number of droplets found
in 18 frames for each of the sample.

Conclusion
Owing to the importance of inhibition of TDP-43 aggregation and the current
unavailability of effective drugs against ALS, a small molecule AIM4 had been
previously demonstrated to be a candidate for the inhibition of the TDP-43
aggregation [71]. Here, mechanism of AIM4-mediated inhibition was investigated
through computational tools and it was further examined if AIM4 can also inhibit
the mutant TDP-432C-A315T’s amyloid-like aggregation and liquid-liquid phase
separation, the potential precursor process leading to its aggregation [99]. Recently,
a cryo-EM structure was solved from the core amyloidogenic region (aa: 288-319;
PDB ID: 6N3C) of TDP-43 having A315E familial ALS mutation [75] and here
another familial A315T mutation was incorporated in silico into the 6N3C structure
and these two structures were used for examining AIM4’s affinity. In addition,
other known structures from TDP-43 sequence namely, tandem RRMs (aa: 96-269;
PDB ID: 4BS2), N-terminal domain (aa: 1-89; PDB ID: 2N4P) and ten
amyloidogenic peptide fragments from the low complexity domain (LCD) of TDP43, were also used to predict the binding site of AIM4. Computational studies
predicted better binding of AIM4 than the other used ligands to the aa: 288-319
amyloidogenic core region of TDP-43 with the A315E and A315T familial
mutations. Also, from the in silico studies, in the 6N3C-A315T mutant TDP-43
structure (aa: 288-319), AIM4 was predicted to interact preferentially with two
amino acids, glycine and phenylalanine which are also already known to be involved
in its pathogenic liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Therefore, the ability of
AIM4 to modulate LLPS of TDP-43 was investigated in vitro using a recombinantly
purified C-terminal fragment, TDP-432C-A315T containing aa: 193-414 of TDP-43.

Strikingly, AIM4 was found here to inhibit the LLPS of the TDP-432C-A315T
protein. In summary, this study predicted the C-terminal region aa: 288-319 of TDP43 to have a possible binding site for AIM4 which may be responsible for the
inhibition of TDP-43 aggregation by AIM4. Furthermore, of high significance, the
study also demonstrated an ability of AIM4 to inhibit the in vitro LLPS of the
mutant A315T-TDP-432C proteins thereby asserting the need for further
investigations on applicability of AIM4 as an anti-TDP-43 aggregation molecule
with relevance to ALS therapeutics.
