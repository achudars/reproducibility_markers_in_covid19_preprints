Abstract
The role of visual pattern adaptation, and learning, in spatial integration was investigated.
Observers reported whether a grid of identical tilted bars is perceived as rows or columns
(perceptual grouping task). Performance was measured multiple times during a session to
determine effects of repeated exposure to the stimuli. To test for possible effects of
learning on the within-session dynamics, observers repeated the experiment on five days.
We found that repeated performance produced rapid within-day improvements, which
were largely transient, and were not retained when tested on subsequent days. In addition,
exposure to stimuli with equal orientation contributed to the within-session improvement,
whereas stimuli having an orientation differing by 45° from the original orientation
diminished the improvement previously obtained in the same session. Practice with the
task, over days, resulted in faster improvements. The transient nature of these exposure
driven improvements and their susceptibility to interference by stimuli designed to reduce
adaptation suggest that adaptation was their main cause. Finally, to investigate the effects
of adaptation on internal noise and on spatial integration, we employed an external noise
paradigm, showing that internal noise reduction resulted from adaptation. Internal noise
was reduced only when spatial integration was effective, suggesting that adaptation
improved perception of global stimulus properties. Overall, our results suggest that the
grouping task benefits from an adaptation process that rapidly adjusts the visual system to
the statistics of the visual stimuli. We suggest that this effect is achieved through spatial
decorrelation of neural responses. With practice, those adjustments are made faster.

Introduction

2

Grouping of spatially distinct elements into coherent objects, a fundamental function of

3

the visual system, requires spatial integration, with its effectiveness depending on long-

4

range correlations in the image. A previous report demonstrated the effectiveness of a

5

model based on spatial-correlations to successfully account for performance in a

6

perceptual grouping task (Ben-Av & Sagi, 1995). It was shown that for a task in which

7

observers had to report the organization of the stimuli as either horizontal rows or vertical

8

columns, grouping occurred in the direction with higher spatial-correlations. However,

9

brain representations of the stimuli are contaminated with internal, neuronal, noise.

10

Uncorrelated internal noise is averaged out by spatial integration, but spatially correlated

11

internal noise may bias the grouping signal and distort perception. It was demonstrated

12

that even weakly correlated noise substantially limits effective signal capacity, which in

13

return can reduce psychophysical performance (Zohary, Shadlen, & Newsome, 1994).

14

Visual adaptation is considered here as a stimulus-driven process which continuously and

15

quickly adjusts the neural responses to the statistics of the current visual environment.

16

Contrary to perceptual learning, which leads to long-term improvements in performance,

17

adaptation effects are typically short-termed. Previous studies tested the effects of visual

18

pattern adaptation on visual sensitivity. Adaptation to intensity-modulated gratings

19

typically shows reduced sensitivity to low-contrast gratings of similar orientation and

20

spatial frequency (Blakemore & Campbell, 1969). Some evidence for improved contrast

21

discrimination around the adapted contrast level was provided, but these effects were

22

small and inconsistent (Barlow, Macleod, & Van Meeteren, 1976; Greenlee & Heitger,

23

1988; Määttänen & Koenderink, 1991; Ross, Speed, & Morgan, 1993). Similarly, only

24

mixed and weak results were found for improved discrimination following face

25

adaptation (Ng, Boynton, & Fine, 2008; Rhodes, Maloney, Turner, & Ewing, 2007;

26

Yang, Shen, Chen, & Fang, 2011). Sensory adaptation has been proposed to improve

27

coding efficiency by reducing redundancy in sensory signals, possibly by decorrelating

28

neuronal responses (Barlow & Földiák, 1989). Experimental support for this idea were

29

provided by studies showing that adaptation decorrelates neural responses in monkey V1

30

neurons (Gutnisky & Dragoi, 2008), and maintains decorrelation across the population of

31

cat V1 neurons (Benucci, Saleem, & Carandini, 2013). Thus, spatial decorrelation is

32

expected to improve performance on visual tasks involving spatial integration, such as

33

perceptual grouping.

34

Here we examined the spatial aspects of visual adaptation, by testing the effects of

35

adaptation on the spatial integration of visual information. For this purpose, we tested

36

how the performance of a perceptual grouping task, which includes repeated exposure to

37

the grouping stimulus, changes during a testing session. To test the possible effects of

38

experience with the stimuli on the within-session dynamics (Yehezkel, Sagi, Sterkin,

39

Belkin, & Polat, 2010), observers performed five daily sessions. We found that repeated

40

performance of the grouping task produced a rapid within-day improvement, which was

41

largely transient, and was not fully retained when tested on subsequent days. We took the

42

transient nature of the gains to imply that they resulted from rapid adaptation to the visual

43

stimuli. Practice with the task, over several days, resulted in faster adaptation, in

44

accordance with previous findings (Yehezkel, Sagi, Sterkin, Belkin, & Polat, 2010). To

45

further test our suggestion that exposure-based adaptation affects the performance in the

46

grouping task, we explicitly tested how performance on the task changed following

47

exposure to stimuli with the same orientation as in the grouping task or to stimuli with the

48

orientation offset by 45°. Performance in the task improved following adaptation to the

49

same stimuli, whereas adaptation to stimuli with orientation offset by 45° (de-adaptation)

50

reduced performance. Finally, to uncover the effects of adaptation on internal noise and

51

on noise reduction, we employed an external noise paradigm (Green & Swets, 1966; Lu

52

& Dosher, 2008). The results showed reduced internal noise as a consequence of

53

adaptation, with learning reducing the effect of external noise.

54

Overall, our results suggest that the grouping task benefits from an adaptation process

55

that rapidly adjusts the visual system to the statistics of the stimulus orientations. With

56

practice, this adjustment can be made faster.

Methods

60

Apparatus

61

The stimuli were presented on a 23.6’’ VIEWPixx/3D monitor (1920 x 1080, 10bit,

62

120Hz, with 'scanning backlight mode') viewed at a distance of 100 cm. The mean

63

luminance of the display was 47.26 cd/m2 in an otherwise dark environment.

64

Observers

65

Thirty-five observers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in the

66

experiments. All observers were naïve to the perceptual grouping task and gave their

67

written informed consent. The work was carried out in accordance with the Code of

68

Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).

69

Stimuli and task

70

Perceptual grouping task: The stimulus, of 40 ms duration, consisted of a grid of identical

71

diagonal bars (19 ×19, tilted 45° counterclockwise from the vertical, 26.4 × 2.8 arcmin,

72

length × width, and spaced 46.8 arcmin apart). The experimental variable was the

73

difference between the horizontal spacing and the vertical spacing between the bars (dh-

74

dv), thus controlling proximity-based grouping (Ben-Av & Sagi, 1995). The 13

75

differences tested were ±13.9, ±10.8, ±7.4, ±3.9, ±2.0, ±1.0 and 0 arcmin. A positive

76

difference implies smaller spacing in the vertical direction, a columnar organization.

77

Since the unequal spacing between the rows and the columns also affected the overall

78

shape of the stimulus, introducing unwanted cues, a circular frame was added (radius=

79

366 arcmin), so that the global form of the stimulus was circular across all experiments

80

(Fig. 1A). A 2AFC (2-Alternative-Forced-Choice) task was used, where observers

81

reported the perceived organization of the display as one of two possible configurations:

82

rows or columns. Response feedback was provided only during the familiarization

83

session performed on the first day (to be consistent with previous studies using the same

84

stimuli and task, e.g. Yehezkel et al., 2010). Each block of trials, of about 4 minutes

85

duration, contained 12 or 13 dh-dv differences (depending on the inclusion of the dh-

86

dv=0 ), intermixed (8 or 9 trials per difference). The measured psychometric curves (the

87

percentage of vertical responses as a function of dh-dv) were fitted with a cumulative

88

normal distribution (Fig. 2). The parameters obtained were used to estimate the point of

89

subjective equality (PSE) where the rows and columns were reported with equal

90

probability, and the slope of the psychometric function at that point (performance

91

sensitivity). The discrimination threshold was defined as the standard deviation ( of the

92

normal distribution fitted to the produced psychometric functions (lapse rate: up to 0.05,

93

separately for lambda and gamma). Fitting was performed using Psignifit 4.0 software for

94

MATLAB (Schütt, Harmeling, Macke, & Wichmann, 2016). In order to verify that the

95

grid stimulus did not cause a specific bias in favor of one of the perceptual organizations

96

(horizontal or vertical), we calculated for each observer the average PSE (across all

97

blocks). The average PSE across observers was not significantly different from zero

98

(0.28±0.4, mean±SEM, p=0.5, paired t-test), indicating that there was no consistent

99

perceptual bias in favor of one of the perceptual organizations.

100

Adaptation induction: Observers were presented with trials exposing the same grid of

101

bars as in the grouping task (40ms duration), but without performing the task. To ensure

102

that the observers were effectively exposed to the stimuli, they were asked to report the

103

presence/absence of an easily detectable (>90% correct detection) wide bar, presented in

104

the left or right stimulus quadrant with equal probability (Fig. 1B). Each adaptation block

105

contained 5 dh-dv differences (±2.0, ±1.0 and 0 arcmin), intermixed (40 trials per

106

difference), and lasted about 4 min. There were three types of adaptation blocks: 1.

107

‘Diagonal’ blocks in which the orientation of the bars in the adapting stimulus was the

108

same as in the perceptual grouping task (tilted 45° counterclockwise from the vertical). 2.

109

‘Vertical’ blocks, in which the orientation of the adapting stimulus was vertical. 3.

110

‘Mixed’ blocks, in which vertical and horizontal adapting stimuli were randomly mixed

111

during adaptation (Fig. 1C). Exposure to stimuli having the same orientation as the tested

112

grouping stimuli (‘Diagonal’ stimuli) is expected to enhance adaptation to the grouping

113

stimuli, whereas exposure to stimuli with 45° offset orientation (‘Vertical’ and ‘Mixed’

114

stimuli) is expected to reduce adaptation to the previous orientation (Greenlee &

115

Magnussen, 1988; Harris, Gliksberg, & Sagi, 2012).

Procedures

118

Experiment 1: Testing perceptual grouping

119

Observers (N=12) carried out the perceptual grouping task during five daily sessions

120

(four blocks on day 1, five blocks on days 2-3, and six blocks on days 4-5). The time

121

interval between subsequent sessions was 1-4 days. Overall, observers performed 2704

122

grouping trials (26 blocks × 13 dh-dv differences × 8 trials per difference).

123

Experiment 2: Adaptation and de-adaptation

124

Two experiments examined the dependence of the grouping performance on the

125

adaptation/de-adaptation induction.

126

Experiment 2a: Nine of the observers that participated in the first experiment participated

127

in this experiment, which included four daily sessions. In each session, observers were

128

tested with three blocks of the perceptual grouping task, followed by three blocks of

129

adaptation/de-adaptation, and then tested again with three blocks of the perceptual

130

grouping task. Two of the sessions contained ‘Diagonal’ adaptation blocks (the same

131

orientation as in the perceptual grouping task), whereas the other two sessions contained

132

either ‘Vertical’ de-adaptation blocks (six observers) or ‘Mixed’ de-adaptation blocks

133

(three observers). Overall, each observer performed 2496 grouping trials (24 blocks × 13

134

dh-dv differences × 8 trials per difference) and 2400 adaptation/de-adaptation trials.

135

Experiment 2b: Ten new observers performed the grouping task in testing blocks that

136

were interleaved with adaptation/de-adaptation blocks. The experiment included two

137

daily sessions, each containing five blocks of the perceptual grouping task and four

138

adaptation/de-adaptation blocks (‘Diagonal’ or ‘Mixed’, respectively). The Grouping

139

blocks were interleaved with the adaptation/de-adaptation blocks to create one of two

140

block sequences: G→Ad→G→deAd→G→Ad→G→deAd→G or

141

G→deAd→G→Ad→G→deAd→G→Ad→G, where G denotes a grouping block, Ad

142

denotes a ‘Diagonal’ adaptation block, and deAd denotes a ‘Mixed’ de-adaptation block.

143

Observers performed both sequences, on different days, starting with either the first

144

sequence or the second sequence, counterbalanced between observers. Overall, each

145

observer performed 1040 grouping trials (10 blocks × 13 dh-dv differences × 8 trials per

146

difference) and 1600 adaptation/de-adaptation trials.

147

Experiment 3: External noise

148

Observers performed the perceptual grouping task with external noise added to the

149

stimuli. External noise was added as a random uniformly distributed displacement (in x

150

and y directions) to the position of each element in the display. There were two groups,

151

either the ‘lower noise’ group (N=7) or the ‘higher noise’ group (N=6), differing in their

152

levels of external noise included. There were five daily sessions, each with two blocks of

153

trials. Each block contained equal numbers of randomly intermixed trials that included

154

stimuli either without external noise or with one of two noise levels. In the ‘lower noise’

155

group, the external noise was either low or intermediate (uniformly distributed within a

156

range of ±2.8 or ±5.6 arcmin). In the ‘higher noise’ group, the external noise was either

157

intermediate or high (uniformly distributed within a range of ±5.6 or ±11.2 arcmin).

158

Overall, the observers performed 3240 trials (10 blocks × 12 dh-dv differences × 9 trials

159

per difference × 3 noise levels).

160

Modeling the external noise: Testing human sensitivity to external noise allows one to

161

characterize the limiting properties of task performance, arising from internal and

162

external noise (Lu & Dosher, 1999; Nagaraja, 1964). We fit the measured thresholds to a

163

standard model assuming the additivity of external noise and equivalent internal noise,

164

the latter representing internal variations expressed in terms of stimulus variations,

165

limiting performance in the absence of external noise. Accordingly, we defined threshold

166

as the displacement (dh-dv) value that is equal to the total noise in the stimulus, that is,

167

the sum of variations generated by the external noise (sum of the noise variances in the X

168

and Y direction) and the equivalent internal noise. This threshold was estimated by the

169

standard deviation ( of the normal distribution fitted to the produced psychometric

170

functions (see above, stimuli and task). We further assumed that the visual system

171

integrates the spatially distributed external noise, with an integration coefficient that

172

depends on the adaptation level and experience with the task. This model is summarized

173

by the following equation:

where  denotes the (inverse) efficiency of external-noise integration, estimating the

175

capacity of the grouping process to reduce the impact of external noise by spatial

176

integration. Nint and Next correspond to the SD of the equivalent-internal and external

177

noises, respectively, and both are expressed in stimulus units. Note that we do not assume

178

that the efficiency parameter controls the effective internal noise, an assumption that

179

requires the internal noise to be spatially uncorrelated. We tested the dependence of the

180

two free parameters,  and Nint, on experience within and between sessions, by fitting the

181

above equation to the threshold vs external noise data at each session start and end, for

182

each observer separately. In each such fit, there were 3 external noise levels (zero, low

183

and intermediate levels in the ‘lower noise’ group; zero, intermediate and high in the

184

‘higher noise’ group) and 3 threshold measurements. A least square fitting method was

185

used. Note that  and Nint may display similar dependencies on time, since Nint may

186

improve with spatial integration, depending on spatial correlations within the visual

187

system.

Results

208

Experiment 1: Repeated performance on the perceptual grouping task

209

The observer’s performance on the perceptual grouping task was measured by the

210

percentage of ’vertical’ reports as a function of dh-dv (psychometric function, Fig. 2).

211

The discrimination threshold was defined as the standard deviation of the normal

212

distribution fitted to the produced psychometric functions (see Methods). Figure 3

213

displays the average discrimination threshold (across observers) for each testing block

214

and daily session. Results show significant within-session improvements, indicated by a

215

significant decrease in the threshold from the first training block to the last training block

216

(2.5±0.6, p<0.01; 3.1±0.9, p<0.01; 3.0±0.8, p<0.01; 1.1±0.6, p=0.09; 2.0±0.6, p<0.01;

217

mean±SEM, paired t-test, improvements within 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th sessions,

218

respectively). In addition, the first threshold measured on each day was significantly

219

higher than the threshold of the last training block of the previous day (2.5±0.6, p<0.01;

220

2.3±0.6, p<0.01; 0.9±0.4, p<0.05; 1.7±0.3, p<0.01; mean±SEM, paired t-test, threshold

221

increase between sessions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5, respectively), showing that the within-

222

day performance gains were not fully retained in subsequent daily sessions. The transient

223

nature of these gains suggests the involvement of visual adaptation as their main cause.

224

Next, we investigated whether the dynamics of performance changed between days. The

225

results show that there were no significant changes between the threshold reductions

226

within the first day and the threshold reductions within subsequent days (first vs second

227

day: p=0.5, first vs third day: p=0.6, first vs fourth day, p=0.2, first vs fifth day: p=0.5,

228

paired t-test). However, as shown in Fig. 3, practice with the task resulted in faster

229

within-session threshold reductions. On day 1 the threshold was gradually reduced. On

230

days 2 and 3, the threshold was sharply reduced already in the second block. Whereas the

231

threshold of the first block in days 2 and 3 was similar to the threshold of the first block

232

in the first day (1st day: 7.9±0.7, 2nd day: 7.9±0.8, p=1.0, 3rd day: 7.0±0.9, p=0.5,

233

mean±SEM, paired t-test), the threshold of the second block in these days was

234

significantly reduced as compared to the threshold of the second block in the first day

235

(1st day: 6.3±0.8, 2nd day: 4.6±0.6, p<0.01, 3rd day: 4.4±0.4, p<0.01, mean±SEM,

236

paired t-test). With more practice, the threshold reduction on days 4 and 5 started even

237

faster, already in the threshold of the first block, which was significantly reduced

238

compared to the threshold of the first block of the first day (4th day: 4.9±0.4, p<0.01, 5th

239

day: 5.6±0.6, p<0.05, mean±SEM, paired t-test). To quantify the speedup of the within-

240

session threshold decrease, we fitted the daily thresholds (averaged across observers) to

241

an exponential decay model, assuming that the initial and final thresholds are fixed across

242

days. The model was successful in accounting for 86% (R2) of the variance in the data

243

(Fig. 3: 26 datum points, 7 free parameters). We found that the time constant gradually

244

decreased during the 5 testing days, showing ~4 times faster within session threshold

245

reduction at day 5 as compared with day 1 (see inset, Fig. 3). These faster within-session

246

improvements with practice could possibly result from faster re-adaptation (Yehezkel et

247

al., 2010).

Fig. 3. Grouping thresholds in the perceptual grouping task, showing within-day improvements that are not

258

corresponding to ±1SEM. The inset plot displays the time constant ( sessions) of an exponential decay

Experiment 2: Adaptation/de-adaptation

262

Here we set out to test the hypothesis that the transient within-day improvement obtained

263

in the grouping task was due to task-independent, exposure based, sensory adaptation.

264

Experiment 2a: Nine observers from Experiment 1 were exposed to trials presenting the

265

grouping stimuli, but they performed a detection task instead of the grouping task (see

266

Methods). Figure 4 displays the average grouping performance in daily sessions that

267

contained ‘Diagonal’ adaptation blocks, and in daily sessions that contained ‘Vertical’ or

268

‘Mixed’ de-adaptation blocks. The results show that following exposure to stimuli having

269

the same orientation as the grouping stimuli (‘Diagonal’), the within-session improved

270

grouping performance was preserved, and somewhat improved, as expected from sensory

271

adaptation. However, with the ‘Vertical’ and ‘Mixed’ exposure blocks, the grouping

272

thresholds significantly increased, in agreement with the de-adaptation hypothesis. In

273

order to investigate whether these trends were statistically significant, we quantified for

274

each observer the pre-exposure performance and the post-exposure performance. The

275

pre-exposure performance was calculated as the average threshold of the two perceptual

276

grouping blocks before exposure, and the post-adaptation performance was calculated as

277

the average threshold of the two blocks after exposure. The differences between the pre-

278

exposure and the post-exposure performances were statistically significant for the

279

different adaptation/de-adaptation types (‘Diagonal’ adaptation: -0.8±0.2, ‘Vertical’ &

280

‘Mixed’ de-adaptation: 0.7±0.2, pairwise t-test between conditions showing p<0.01, Fig.

282

adaptation: 4.3±0.4, post-adaptation: 3.5±0.4, p<0.05, paired t-test, Fig. 4), and

283

significantly increased following exposure to ‘Vertical’ & ‘Mixed’ blocks (pre-

293

Experiment 2b: Ten new observers performed grouping blocks that were interleaved with

294

exposure blocks. Figure 5 displays the average grouping performance (across observers)

295

for the two interleaved block sequences. The average threshold (across blocks) following

296

a ‘Diagonal’ exposure (adaptation: 4.8±0.5, SEM) was significantly lower (p<0.01,

297

paired t-test) than the average threshold following a ‘Mixed’ exposure (de-adaptation:

298

6.1±0.8, SEM). Here we used only the ‘Mixed’ blocks to avoid possible appearance

299

biases that resulted from continuous adaptation to vertical lines as in the ‘Vertical’

300

blocks.

301

The results of the two adaptation/de-adaptation experiments support the hypothesis that

302

the transient improvements at the beginning of each session result from a task-

303

independent adaptation process that rapidly adjusts the visual system to the stimulus

304

orientation. The improved performance following exposure to stimuli with the same

305

orientation is suggested to arise from adaptation, since perceptual learning is thought to

306

be task specific (Ahissar & Hochstein, 1993; Fahle & Morgan, 1996). Most importantly,

307

exposure to stimuli with 45° offset orientation, as in the ‘Vertical’ and ‘Mixed’ blocks,

308

resulted in a significant deterioration of performance, rather than improvement. This

309

result is in accordance with the adaptation literature showing de-adaptation for stimuli

310

offset by 45° (Greenlee & Magnussen, 1988; Harris et al., 2012; Pinchuk-Yacobi, Harris,

311

& Sagi, 2016)(Greenlee & Magnussen, 1988; Harris et al., 2012).

Fig. 6. Performance in the perceptual grouping task with external noise. The experiment included five daily

sessions, with two blocks per day (Start and End). Each block contained equal numbers of randomly

333

intermixed trials with stimuli either without external noise (noise level =0) or with one of two noise levels.

334

Overall, there were three external noise levels: low (‘1’, jitter of 2.8 arcmin), intermediate (‘2’, jitter of 5.6

335

arcmin), and high (‘4’, jitter of 11.2 arcmin). (A) Performance of the ‘lower noise’ group (N=7), low and

and mid noise levels), day (5 days), and time (start and end of session) performed

341

separately for the two groups. We used only the data obtained from trials with no noise

(see Appendix for statistical analysis performed on the whole data). For both groups,

344

threshold increased significantly when external noise was added to the stimuli (F(1,6) =

345

130.3, p< 0.001, F(1,5) = 10.3, p<0.05, the ‘lower noise’ group and the ‘higher noise’

346

group, respectively). Improvement within session, as indicated by the threshold reduction

347

from the start of the session to the end of the session, was only significant for the ‘lower

348

noise’ group (F(1,6) = 93.6, p< 0.01, F(1,5) = 3.7, p =0.1, the ‘lower noise’ group and the

349

‘higher noise’ group, respectively).

350

In order to test the effect of learning in the task, we ran an ANOVA with only the

351

thresholds of the first day (day1) and the last day (day 5), separately for the thresholds at

352

the start and at the end of the session. Learning between the first day and the last day was

353

only significant for the ‘higher noise’ group, and only at the start of the session (start:

354

F(1,6) = 3.7, p =0.1, F(1,5) = 10.3, p< 0.05; end: F(1,6) = 0.06, p =0.8, F(1,5) = 5.9, p

355

=0.06, the ‘lower noise’ group and the ‘higher noise’ group, respectively).

356

Next, we investigated whether the within-session gains, obtained in a training session,

357

were retained in the following session, or whether performance deteriorated from the end

358

of the session to the beginning of the next session. For that purpose, we ran another

359

repeated measures ANOVA with the within-subject factors noise (no noise and mid noise

360

levels), day (day 2-day 5), and time (end of the previous session or the start of the next

361

session). Performance significantly deteriorated from the end of the previous session to

362

the beginning of the next session only for the ‘lower noise’ group (F(1,6) = 31.1, p

363

=0.001, F(1,5) = 0.03, p =0.9, the ‘lower noise’ group and the ‘higher noise’ group,

364

respectively). This was clearly seen on the 2nd day (Fig. 6A), where noise levels 0 and 1

365

at the start of day 2 are back to the starting level of the first day.

366

To compare the performances of the groups, we added to the repeated measures

367

ANOVAs the between-subject factor of group type (‘lower noise’ group or ‘higher noise’

368

group). The only significant differences between the groups were the improvements

369

within-session (F(1,11) = 16.3, p< 0.01) and the deterioration between sessions (F(1,11)

370

= 11.1, p< 0.01), which were significantly lower for the ‘higher noise’ group. These

371

results suggest that mixing trials with high external noise, as with the ‘higher noise’

372

group, reduces the adaptation effect. The learning effects (start: F(1,11) = 1.0, p = 0.4;

373

end: F(1,11) = 0.7, p = 0.4) and the noise effect (F(1,11) = 3.1, p = 0.1) were not

In order to better explore the factors that could contribute to the changes between the

382

groups’ thresholds, we fitted the thresholds (using data from both ‘lower’ and ‘higher’

383

noise groups) to the external-noise model that includes the parameters of an integration

384

coefficient () as well as internal and external noise levels (see Methods)Fitting the

385

integration coefficient resulted in inconsistent and minor changes (either a slight increase

386

or a slight decrease) between subsequent sessions, that is, between a session end and the

387

start of the following session. Therefore, we fixed the value of the integration coefficient

388

between subsequent sessions (value at the start of the session equals to the value at the

389

end of the previous sessions) to reduce the degrees of freedom. Results for the fitted

390

parameters of the integration coefficient and the internal noise, averaged across

391

observers, are displayed in Figs. 7A and 7B, respectively. The two parameters display

392

different dependencies in the two tested groups. When only low and intermediate levels

393

of external noise were added to the stimuli, as in the ‘lower noise’ group, observers

394

quickly learned to integrate the bars, as indicated by a significant reduction of the

395

integration coefficient, apparent already on the first training day (1.9±0.6, p<0.05, paired

396

t-test). This fast improvement in integration, already on the first day, seemed to enable a

397

significant within-session reduction in the internal noise (F(1,6) = 14.6, p< 0.01, two-way

398

ANOVA with within-observers factors of day and time in the session), which was

399

apparent already on the first day (2.0±0.6, p<0.05, paired t-test). The dependence of

400

internal noise on spatial integration is supported by a significant correlation between the

401

values of the two parameters (r=0.39, p<0.001, n=70). In contrast, the ‘higher noise’

402

group displays only a gradual reduction of the integration coefficient across days, and no

403

significant reduction on the first day (0.3±0.2, p=0.2, paired t-test). Accordingly, there

404

was no significant within-session reduction in internal noise (F(1,5) = 1.5, p = 0.3, two-

405

way ANOVA with within-observers factors of day and time in the session), and there was

406

no correlation between the values of the internal noise and the values of the integration

407

coefficient (r=0.0, p=1.0, n=60). Comparing the two groups shows significantly lower

408

internal noise at the end of the sessions in the ‘lower noise’ group compared with the

409

‘higher noise’ group (1.1±0.2, p<0.01, two-sample t-test). Given that the internal noise

410

was significantly reduced only when spatial integration was present (as in the ‘lower

411

noise’ group), suggests that adaptation does not improve performance by uniform

412

reduction of the local internal noise, but by global decorrelation of internal noise across

413

the whole stimulus. 

426

Discussion

427

Our results show that repeated performance on the perceptual grouping task produced

428

within-session improvements, especially at the beginning of each daily session (Fig. 3).

429

These improvements were largely exposure (Fig. 4-5), not task dependent, and were not

430

fully retained in subsequent daily sessions (Fig. 3). In addition, exposure to stimuli with

431

an orientation differing by 45° from the orientation used in the grouping task diminished

432

the improvement previously obtained in the same session (Figs. 4-5). The transient nature

433

of these exposure-driven improvements, and their susceptibility to interference by de-

434

adapting stimuli suggest that they result from an adaptation process that rapidly adjusts

435

the visual system to the orientation statistics of the stimuli.

436

One of the main controversies regarding visual pattern adaptation concerns its potential

437

benefit. At the single neuron level, adaptation was suggested to improve information

438

transfer by adjusting the limited dynamic range of the neuron to the current input

439

statistics (Wainwright, 1999). At the population level, adaptation was suggested to

440

remove redundancies across neurons by de-correlating their neural responses (Barlow &

441

Földiák, 1989). However, previous studies that tested how adaptation affects contrast

442

discrimination found only weak evidence for improved discriminability for stimuli

443

similar to the adapter, predicted by dynamic-range adjustment (Barlow et al., 1976;

444

Greenlee & Heitger, 1988; Määttänen & Koenderink, 1991; Ross et al., 1993). Here we

445

report large improvements in grouping discrimination following adaptation. The

446

difference between our results and the results from previous perceptual adaptation

447

experiments might arise from the different task we used. Perceptual grouping was

448

suggested to rely highly on spatial correlations and spatial integration (Ben-Av, Sagi, &

449

Braun, 1992), and therefore it should be most affected by adaptation-induced changes in

450

spatial correlation. Contrast discrimination, on the other hand, shows no improvements

451

from spatial integration when the base and increment contrasts are over an equal spatial

452

extent, possibly due to balanced excitation and inhibition interactions (Bonneh & Sagi,

453

1999). Ben-Av & Sagi (1995) suggest that perceptual grouping involves a process that

454

compares horizontal and vertical intensity correlations, and that grouping occurs in the

455

direction with the higher degree of correlation. Given the high reliance of grouping on

456

spatial correlations and integration, we argue that adaptation improves performance in the

457

task by spatial decorrelation. Consequently, we propose two possible mechanisms for

458

such improvements. One, removal of the average spatial correlation between all signals,

459

assisting the comparison process in distinguishing between small differences in

460

correlation values. Two, removal of correlations between the internal noises of

461

neighboring neurons, increasing the efficiency of spatial integration and improving

462

signal-to-noise ratio. An alternative explanation might have been that adaptation

463

improves performance on the task by local means, such as reduction of internal noise at

464

all locations, or local improvements in spatial or orientation resolutions. However, our

465

results in the external noise experiment indicate that spatial integration is essential for

466

obtaining the benefits of adaptation. Challenging spatial integration, by randomly mixing

467

trials with high external noise as in the ‘higher noise’ group, resulted in reduced spatial

468

integration and a significantly higher internal noise at the end of the sessions (Fig. 7). In

469

accordance, the adaptation effects of within-session improvements and between-session

470

deteriorations were significantly reduced in the ‘higher noise’ group (Fig. 6).

471

Comparing the performance in the perceptual grouping task in our experiments to the

472

performance in other perceptual tasks shows compatible within-session improvements

473

(Aberg, Tartaglia, & Herzog, 2009; Fahle, Edelman, & Poggio, 1995; Hussain, Sekuler,

474

& Bennett, 2008; Karni & Sagi, 1993). However, contrary to other perceptual tasks in

475

which the initial performance in each session is usually equivalent to (or even better than)

476

the performance obtained at the end of the previous session (Harris & Sagi, 2015; Karni

477

& Sagi, 1993), performance in the grouping task was largely reduced in the first block of

478

subsequent sessions. This reduced initial performance indicates that the within-session

479

gains obtained in the preceding training session were not retained in the next session (Fig.

480

3, the first three sessions) or were only partially retained (the fourth and fifth sessions).

481

Failure to retain the within-session gains was also apparent in the repeated re-emergence

482

of significant within-session improvements in all daily sessions. This behavior is

483

inconsistent with typical within-session improvements obtained in other perceptual

484

learning tasks, which mostly appear during the first training session and tend to diminish

485

in subsequent sessions (Harris et al., 2012; Karni & Sagi, 1993). In addition to the

486

diminished performance at the beginning of each session, which can be related to passive

decay due to passage of time between sessions, performance within-session was also

488

reduced after explicit exposure to de-adapting stimuli. Performance was diminished only

489

following adaptation to stimuli that were offset by 45° from the orientation of the original

490

grouping stimuli (‘Vertical’ or ‘Mixed’ orientation), and was enhanced following

491

adaptation to stimuli with the same orientation as in the grouping task (‘Diagonal’

492

orientation). Thus, the deterioration effect was specific to the orientation of the stimuli.

493

These results can be related to studies that tested the effects of adaptation on orientation

494

mixtures. Greenlee & Magnussen (1988) found reduced contrast adaptation when vertical

495

and diagonal gratings were interleaved during the adaptation period. Harris & Sagi

496

(2015) found, using the texture discrimination task, slower within-session learning when

497

using a fixed texture orientation, compared with conditions where two orientations

498

differing by 45° were interleaved, attributing the effect to differences in orientation-

499

specific adaptation.

500

Previous studies used external noise to explore the factors that contribute to the learning

501

of a perceptual task (Lu & Dosher, 2008). Most relevant to our study is a study by Li,

502

Levi, & Klein (2004) that used position noise to explore the neural mechanisms

503

underlying learning of a visual position discrimination task. Li et al (2004) found that

504

with learning observers improved performance by using more efficient and broader

505

stimulus samples in their position judgments. These results are consistent with our

506

findings of between-session learning of the integration coefficient. The within-session

507

dynamics cannot be compared since performance results were only reported as within-

508

session means. Furthermore, Li et al (2004) assumed internal noise to be spatially

509

uncorrelated, thus predicting reduced effective internal noise with increasing sampling

510

efficiency, while we suggest these correlations to be adaptation dependent. Interestedly,

511

Li et al (2004) noted that, unlike with high external noise, in the low external noise

512

condition, which was dominated by the internal noise, the measured human thresholds

513

were much lower than the thresholds predicted by an ideal observer. This result can be

514

explained by assuming that the internal noise contained correlations that limited the

515

benefit obtained from more efficient and broader stimulus sampling.

516

The dynamics of the within- and the between-session gains in our experiment can also be

517

related to studies of motor adaptation learning (Krakauer, 2009; Krakauer, Ghez, &

518

Ghilardi, 2005). The return to the baseline performance level at the beginning of the

519

second and third sessions resembles the ‘forgetting’ of motor improvements, when

520

subjects are re-exposed to the same motor adaptation task later in time. In addition, the

521

faster within-session threshold reduction with more daily sessions can be explained by a

522

faster rate of re-adaptation, similar to faster relearning of a motor adaptation task

523

following repetitive practice over time. Such faster re-adaptation was also shown recently

524

following repeated adaptation to a prism distortion (Habtegiorgis, Rifai, Lappe, & Wahl,

525

2018; Yehezkel et al., 2010). These results of long-term effects of adaptation, which are

526

found in several modalities, such as motor and vision, are consistent with theories

527

suggesting that adaptation involve temporary plasticity of inhibitory synapses (Dealy &

528

Tolhurst, 1974; Wilson, 1975). Perhaps when a substantial amount of adaptation is

529

provided in a specific context (such as in the context of a perceptual task), the temporary

530

plasticity can be made long-term.

Appendix

625

Here we performed the same ANOVA analyzes as described in the results section of

626

Experiment 3, but on the whole data (including all noise levels). For both groups,

627

thresholds increased significantly when external noise was added to the stimuli (F(2,12) =

628

40.3, p< 0.001, F(2,10) = 23.1, p< 0.001, the ‘lower noise’ group and the ‘higher noise’

629

group, respectively), and thresholds decreased significantly from the start of the session

630

to the end of the session, demonstrating within-session improvements (F(1,6) = 72.8, p<

631

0.001, F(1,5) = 7.3, p< 0.05, the ‘lower noise’ group and the ‘higher noise’ group,

632

respectively). Learning between the first day and the last day was only significant for the

633

‘higher noise’ group (start: F(1,6) = 3.2, p = 0.12, F(1,5) = 18.2, p< 0.01; end: F(1,6) =

634

0.007, p=0.9, F(1,5) = 22.6, p< 0.01, the ‘lower noise’ group, and the ‘higher noise’

635

group, respectively). Deterioration in performance from the end of the previous sessions

636

to the beginning of the next session was only significant for the ‘lower noise’ group

637

(F(1,6) = 45.7, p< 0.001, F(1,5) = 0.4, p = 0.6, the ‘lower noise’ group and the ‘higher

638

noise’ group, respectively).
