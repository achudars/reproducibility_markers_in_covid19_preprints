Abstract
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a critical regulator of immune homeostasis through its impact on

16

both regulatory T (Treg) and effector T (Teff) cells. However, the precise role of IL-2 in the

17

maintenance and function of Treg cells in the adult peripheral immune system remains unclear.

18

Here, we report that neutralization of IL-2 abrogated all IL-2 receptor signaling in Treg cells,

19

resulting in rapid dendritic cell (DC) activation and subsequent Teff cell proliferation. By

20

contrast, despite substantially reduced IL-2 sensitivity, Treg cells maintained selective IL-2

21

signaling and prevented immune dysregulation following treatment with the inhibitory anti-

22

CD25 antibody PC61, even when CD25hi Treg cells were depleted. Thus, despite severely

23

curtailed CD25 expression and function, Treg cells retain selective access to IL-2 that supports

24

their anti-inflammatory functions in vivo. Antibody-mediated targeting of CD25 is being actively

25

pursued for treatment of autoimmune disease and preventing allograft rejection, and our findings

26

help inform therapeutic manipulation and design for optimal patient outcomes.

Introduction
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a critical regulator of immune homeostasis through its role in the

30

development, maintenance and function of T regulatory (Treg) cells and its impact on effector

31

cell proliferation and differentiation [1, 2]. The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) can be composed of 2 or 3

32

subunits: IL-2R

33

β (CD122) and the common gamma (γc) chain (CD132) together form the
intermediate affinity receptor, and the addition of IL-2Rα (CD25) creates the high affinity

34

receptor. Binding of CD25 to IL-2 induces a conformational change that decreases the energy

35

needed to bind to the rest of the receptor, whereas CD122 and CD132 are the critical signaling

36

chains [3]. Treg cells constitutively express CD25, which under homeostatic conditions allows

37

them to outcompete CD25- T effector (Teff) cells and natural killer (NK) cells for limiting

38

amounts of IL-2. This is most important in the secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), where pro-

39

survival signals downstream of IL-2 signaling maintain Treg cells [4, 5]. Notably, Treg cells

40

cannot make their own IL-2 [6, 7], and therefore depend on IL-2 produced mainly from

41

autoreactive CD4+ Teff cells [8, 9]. In this way, Teff and Treg cell populations are dynamically

42

linked and reciprocally control each other to maintain immune homeostasis [10].

43

When the IL-2-dependent balance of Treg and Teff cells is disrupted, autoimmunity and

44

inflammation can occur. Genetic deficiency in CD25, CD122, or IL-2 results in systemic

45

autoimmune disease in mice [11], and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL2 and

46

IL2RA genes are associated with multiple autoimmune diseases in both mice and humans [12,

47

13]. Therefore, manipulating the IL-2 signaling pathway therapeutically for treatment of

48

autoimmune disease is an area of immense interest. Low dose IL-2 therapy, which enriches Treg

49

cells, has shown efficacy in murine autoimmune models [14-19], and has also benefitted patients

50

with graft versus host disease (GVHD) [20], Hepatitis C virus-induced vasculitis [21], alopecia

areata [22], and lupus [23]. However, because IL-2 also acts on effector cells, high dose IL-2 can

52

promote inflammatory responses and this is used for treatment of cancer [24]. As such, safety of

53

therapeutic IL-2 remains a concern, and efficacy can vary widely depending on the current

54

disease activity and immune history of the patient. Indeed, in two mouse models of type 1

55

diabetes, early intervention with IL-2 prevented disease, but initiation of treatment after loss of

56

tolerance (but before overt hyperglycemia) accelerated disease progression [13, 19]. The fact that

57

monoclonal antibodies against CD25 are also used as an immunosuppressive to treat organ

58

transplant rejection [25] and demonstrated efficacy against multiple sclerosis (MS) [26] further

59

highlights the complexity of targeting this signaling pathway.

60

The inhibitory anti-CD25 antibody PC61 has been extensively used to examine the role

61

of CD25 in IL-2 signaling in Treg cells in mice [27, 28], and model the impact of blocking IL-2

62

signaling in vivo. However, interpretation of results is difficult due to uncertainty of whether the

63

observed in vivo effects are mediated by functional blockade of CD25, Treg cell depletion, or a

64

combination [29-31]. Using PC61 derivatives with identical epitope specificity but divergent

65

constant region effector function, a recent study showed that only depletion of CD25hi cells and

66

not blockade of CD25 could disrupt immune homeostasis [32]. However, the fact that blockade

67

of CD25 for up to four weeks caused no disturbance in immune homeostasis is surprising, given

68

the central role IL-2 is thought to play in the maintenance of Treg cells in SLOs. For instance,

69

acute blockade of IL-2 using the IL-2 antibody S4B6-1 (S4B6) significantly reduces Treg cells,

70

and when administered early in life causes Treg cell dysfunction sufficient to induce

71

autoimmune gastritis in Balb/c mice [8]. However, in addition to blocking IL-2 binding to CD25,

72

this antibody forms superagonistic IL-2 immune complexes that are specifically targeted to

73

CD122hi effector populations such as NK cells and memory T cells and this may have

74

contributed to disease development in these animals. These divergent results may reflect

75

differences in the importance of IL-2 for the induction vs. maintenance of immune tolerance, or

76

may reflect idiosyncrasies in how the reagents used for IL-2 and CD25 blockade actually impact

77

IL-2 availability and signaling in Treg and Teff cells.

78

In light of this confusion, we comprehensively examined how manipulating the IL-

79

2/CD25 axis by different methods perturbs Treg cell maintenance, phenotype and function in

80

maintaining normal immune homeostasis. We found that neutralization of IL-2 abrogated all

81

STAT5 phosphorylation (pSTAT5) in Treg cells, resulting in rapid dendritic cell (DC) activation

82

and subsequent Teff cell proliferation and expansion. By contrast, Treg cells maintained normal

83

IL-2 signaling in the presence of the inhibitory anti-CD25 antibody PC61 in vivo, despite

84

substantially reduced sensitivity to IL-2. Continued IL-2 signaling was dependent on residual

85

CD25 function, and we found that even CD25lo Treg cells that escape depletion after treatment

86

with a strongly depleting IgG2a version of PC61 initially maintain IL-2 responsiveness and

87

functionality in vivo. However, prolonged anti-CD25-mediated Treg cell depletion results in loss

88

of immune homeostasis and Teff cell proliferation and activation. These findings demonstrate

89

that even with severely curtailed CD25 function, Treg cells retain their selective access to IL-2 in

90

vivo, and this is sufficient to maintain normal Treg cell function and immune homeostasis.

91

These data warrant re-examination of previous studies using the PC61 antibody [31, 32], and

92

have important implications for efforts to target the IL-2/CD25 axis therapeutically to dampen

93

inflammation and induce immune tolerance.

Results

96

Complete antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-2 in vivo

97

Following administration in vivo, the anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibodies S4B6 and JES6-

98

1A12 (JES6) can complex with endogenous IL-2 and act as super-agonists for different

99

leukocyte populations, depending on the antibody used and IL-2R component expression of the

100

cell [33]. However, co-administration of S4B6 and JES6 should block binding to both CD122

101

and CD25, and effectively neutralize all IL-2 function. To test this, we treated mice with either

102

S4B6 alone, equal amounts of S4B6 and JES6, or an excess of JES6 over S4B6, and assessed IL-

103

2 signaling and activation of Treg cells and NK cells after seven days. Due to the qualitative

104

difference in response to IL-2 in Treg cells (bimodal) compared to NK cells (a weaker unimodal

105

shift) (Fig. S1A), we reported response to IL-2 as frequency pSTAT5+ of Treg cells and

106

geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) of NK cells, respectively. S4B6 blocks IL-2

107

binding to CD25, and targets IL-2 to cells expressing high levels of CD122, and accordingly

108

treatment with S4B6 alone induced robust proliferation of NK cells associated with increased

109

STAT5 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). However, the proliferation of NK cells as well as their

110

elevated STAT5 phosphorylation was completely blocked by the addition of an equal amount of

111

the JES6 antibody that inhibits IL-2/CD122 binding. As NK cells express very high levels of

112

CD122 and are potently stimulated by S4B6/IL-2 immune complexes, these data demonstrate

113

addition of JES6 prevents the formation of super-agonistic IL-2/S4B6 immune complexes in

114

vivo. Furthermore, consistent with the ability of S4B6 to effectively block IL-2 interaction with

115

CD25, all treatments potently inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation in Treg cells (Fig. 1B). Thus,

116

this antibody combination can completely neutralize IL-2 activity on multiple cell types in vivo,

and out of an abundance of caution we used an excess of JES6 over S4B6 for the anti-IL-2

118

treatment in all subsequent experiments.

119

Differential impacts of targeting CD25 or IL-2 on CD25+ T cells

120

To compare how inhibiting the IL-2/CD25 axis by targeting either CD25 or IL-2 impacts

121

Treg cell abundance and immune homeostasis, C57BL/6 (B6) mice were treated intraperitoneally

122

(IP) with an engineered isoform of PC61 (PC61N297Q) that inhibits CD25 function but does not

123

deplete CD25-expressing cells, an engineered isoform of PC61 (PC612a) that has strong

124

depleting activity, or a combination of S4B6 and JES6 as above. In line with previously reported

125

findings [32], seven days after treatment Treg cells were reduced by ~50% in mice treated with

126

either PC612a or anti-IL-2 relative to PBS-treated controls (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, no significant

127

change in the frequency or absolute number of Treg cells was observed in PC61N297Q treated

128

mice. Treg cells can be divided into central (c)Treg and effector (e)Treg cells based on

129

differential expression of CD62L and CD44. In both PC612a- and anti-IL-2-treated mice, there

130

was a specific loss of CD62L+CD44lo cTreg cells (Fig. 2B), which express the highest levels of

131

CD25 and are the most dependent on IL-2 for their homeostatic maintenance within the spleen

132

[34]. Staining isolated cells with a flourochrome conjugated PC61 seven days after PC61N297Q

133

and PC612a treatment showed essentially complete coverage of the epitope (Fig. 2A and Fig. 2C),

134

verifying that we used a saturating concentration of injected antibody. To assess CD25

135

expression in treated animals, we stained cells with the 7D4 anti-CD25 antibody, which binds a

136

distinct epitope and does not compete with PC61 for binding. As expected, PC612a treatment

137

effectively depleted CD25hi cells, and the remaining Treg cells in these animals were CD25mid/lo.

138

Similarly, CD25 expression was significantly reduced in anti-IL-2-treated mice, which is likely

139

due to the ability of IL-2 signaling and activated STAT5 to promote CD25 expression in a

positive feedback loop [35]. Interestingly, despite lacking the ability to deplete CD25+ cells,

141

CD25 expression was also significantly decreased on Treg cells from mice that had been treated

142

with PC61N297Q (Fig. 2C), indicating that this antibody may induce surface cleavage or

143

internalization of CD25. Finally, CD4+ and CD8+ Teff cells can transiently express high levels of

144

CD25 upon activation, and thus could also be affected by the treatments administered. While

145

very few CD8+ Teff cells expressed CD25 in any treatment group (not shown), about 2% of

146

Foxp3-CD44+ CD4+ Teff cells were CD25+ (Fig. 2D) and both PC61N297Q and PC612a treatment

147

significantly reduced the frequencies and absolute numbers of this population.

148

IL-2 neutralization leads to cDC2 activation and drives autoreactive Teff cell proliferation

149

A critical function of Treg cells in SLOs is to restrain DC activation and prevent

150

excessive T cell priming. Therefore, to assess the functionality of Treg cells in the anti-CD25

151

and anti-IL-2 treated mice, we examined the DC abundance and activation status in the spleen by

152

measuring expression of CD86 and CD40, two important costimulatory molecules that are

153

upregulated in activated DCs. Although no changes were observed in 33D1-CD11b- type-1

154

conventional DCs (cDC1) or 33D1-CD11bhi monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) (Fig. S1B),

155

expression of CD86 and CD40 was elevated on 33D1+CD11b+ type-2 conventional DCs (cDC2)

156

in anti-IL-2 treated mice (Fig. 3A). Along with the increase in activated DCs, the anti-IL-2

157

treated mice also showed enhanced proliferation of the Foxp3-CD44+ CD4+ and CD44+CD62L+

158

CD8+ Teff cell populations (Fig. 3B). No significant changes in proliferating NK cells were

159

observed, nor in any cell type in mice treated with PC61N297Q or PC612a compared to controls.

160

Thus, although both IL-2 neutralization and PC612a treatments resulted in a similar numeric loss

161

of Treg cells, increased DC activation and proliferation of Teff cells was only observed during

162

IL-2 blockade.

163

We hypothesized that impaired Treg cell function with IL-2 neutralization led to the

164

increased costimulatory molecule expression on cDC2s, which in turn allowed these DCs to

165

more potently activate naïve autoreactive T cells. To directly test this, we used mice expressing a

166

soluble form of ovalbumin (sOVA) that is efficiently processed and presented on the surface of

167

splenic cDC2s [9, 36]. sOVA mice were treated with PBS, PC61N297Q, or anti-IL-2, and on day 7

168

given 0.5x106 CFSE-labelled naïve CD4+ OVA-specific T cells from DO11.10 Rag2-/- mice.

169

Five days post transfer we assessed the proliferation and activation of the DO11.10 cells

170

(identified by staining with the clonotype-specific antibody KJ1-26) in the spleen following their

171

magnetic enrichment (Fig. 3C, D). Although transferred antigen-specific T cells proliferated in

172

all recipient mice, the total number of transferred cells recovered, the proliferation index, and the

173

frequency of cells that had 4 or more divisions were all significantly higher in the anti-IL-2

174

treated mice (Fig. 3D), indicating that altered cDC2 activation following IL-2 blockade promotes

175

the enhanced activation and proliferation of autoreactive CD4+ T cells. We also assessed the

176

ability of peripheral (p)Treg cells to develop from the transferred naïve T cells. Indeed, the

177

frequency and number of splenic Foxp3+ DO11.10 T cells was significantly reduced by both

178

PC61N297Q and anti-IL-2 treatments (Fig. 3E). Host cells from recipient mice showed the same

179

phenotypes as described in Figures 2 and 3 (Fig. S1C) in response to PC61N297Q and anti-IL-2

180

treatment. Collectively, these data confirm the critical role that IL-2 plays in maintaining Treg-

181

dependent DC homeostasis and supporting pTreg cell differentiation in the lymphoid organs, and

182

demonstrate that acute IL-2 neutralization leads to excessive T cell priming and activation.

183

Treg cells retain selective access to IL-2 in a CD25-dependent manner in the presence of PC61

184

The lack of any immune dysregulation in mice treated with PC61N297Q or PC612a suggests

185

that Treg cells in these animals retain significant functional capacity compared with Treg cells in

186

anti-IL-2 treated mice. Indeed, differences in IL-2 signaling in cells subject to these treatments

187

could explain the alterations observed in Treg cell number and function, as well as immune

188

activation status. Therefore, we examined pSTAT5 directly ex vivo in different cell populations

189

one week after antibody administration, when PC61 epitopes on CD25 were still completely

190

saturated (Fig. 2A, C). Whereas neutralization of IL-2 blocked all pSTAT5 as expected, Treg

191

cells from animals treated with PC61N297Q maintained normal levels of pSTAT5, and even

192

treatment with PC612a had only a modest impact on the frequency of pSTAT5+ Treg cells (Fig.

193

4A). The pSTAT5 staining we observed in the treated animals does not simply reflect prolonged

194

IL-2 signaling that occurred prior to treatment initiation, as we have previously shown that

195

injection of IL-2 antibodies as little as 30 minutes prior to sacrifice ameliorates all detectable

196

pSTAT5 in Treg cells [9]. Treatment with PC61N297Q or PC612a also did not redirect IL-2 to

197

effector cells, as the gMFI of pSTAT5 in both NK cells and CD44+CD62L+ CD8+ Teff was not

198

increased by any of the treatments (Fig. S2A). Thus, although numbers of Treg cells are similarly

199

decreased in the PC612a and anti-IL-2-treated animals, sustained IL-2 signaling in PC612a-treated

200

mice likely helps maintain Treg cell function and prevents the overt immune dysregulation that

201

occurs in anti-IL-2-treated animals. IL-2 signaling helps maintain Treg cell function by

202

promoting high expression of Foxp3 [37] and other inhibitory molecules like CTLA-4 [38].

203

Consistent with this, we found that the gMFI of Foxp3 was significantly reduced in anti-IL-2

204

treated mice, whereas PC61N297Q and PC612a had only minor impacts on Foxp3 expression (Fig.

205

4B). Furthermore, Treg cells from PC612a treated mice had elevated expression of CTLA-4

206

compared to anti-IL-2 treated mice (Fig. 4C).

207
208

The ability of Treg cells to maintain IL-2 responsiveness in the presence of the PC61
antibodies led us to two competing hypotheses. Either the CD25 remaining on the cell surface

11
209

was still functional and mediating IL-2 signaling, or residual IL-2 signaling was CD25-

210

independent, perhaps due to upregulation or increased sensitivity of the other IL-2R components

211

on Treg cells, or due to changes in the IL-2R signaling pathways such as downregulation of

212

protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) [39]. Co-staining with the 7D4 anti-CD25 antibody clearly

213

showed that as in control mice, pSTAT5 was enriched among Treg cells expressing the highest

214

amounts of CD25 in both PC61N297Q- and PC612a-treated mice (Fig. 4A). We therefore compared

215

the expression of the other IL-2R components from untreated splenic Treg cells divided into

216

three subsets based on their expression of CD25 by 7D4 staining. Expression of CD122 and

217

CD132 was similar between all three subsets of Treg cells. Furthermore, CD122 expression by

218

Treg cells was much lower than expression by memory T cells or NK cells. Thus, enhanced

219

expression of the intermediate affinity IL-2R cannot explain the ability of CD25hi Treg cells to

220

selectively respond to IL-2 in the presence of the PC61 antibodies (Fig. 4D).

221

To directly assess the effect that the PC61 has on CD25 function and the sensitivity of

222

splenic Treg cells to IL-2, we performed in vitro stimulations in the presence of PC61 and the

223

anti-IL-2 clone S4B6, which directly blocks interaction between IL-2 and CD25 but has minimal

224

impact on IL-2 signaling via the intermediate affinity CD122/CD132 complex [40]. For analysis,

225

Treg cells were subsetted based on their expression of CD25 by 7D4 staining as in Fig 4D.

226

CD25hi Treg cells achieved maximal pSTAT5 at a relatively low dose of rIL-2 (1 U/mL), while

227

CD25mid Treg cells were approximately 10-fold less sensitive and CD25lo Treg cells were more

228

than 100-fold less sensitive (Fig. 4E). Pre-treatment with PC61 for 30 min prior to IL-2

229

stimulation reduced IL-2 sensitivity by ~10-fold in all three Treg cell populations (Fig 4F), but

230

all were still able to achieve the maximal level of pSTAT5 observed in untreated cells. However,

231

further addition of S4B6 severely curtailed IL-2 sensitivity in all Treg cells, indicating that they

232

do not efficiently signal through the intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor. By contrast, in NK cells,

233

which lack CD25 but have high levels of CD122, IL-2 responses were completely unaffected by

234

the addition of PC61 (Fig. 4F, right), and S4B6 had only a small effect on signaling which is due

235

to minor steric inhibition in vitro [40]. Thus, we conclude that CD25 retains significant

236

functionality when bound by PC61. Indeed, PC61 does not directly occlude IL-2 binding, but

237

rather inhibits CD25 function by inducing a conformational change in the IL-2 binding pocket

238

[41]. In fact, at lower doses of IL-2 (1 U/mL), treatment with PC61 actually makes Treg cells

239

more CD25 dependent, as evidenced by the increased CD25 gMFI of pSTAT5+ Treg cells

240

treated with PC61 compared to untreated control cells (Fig. 4G).

241

To examine how in vivo treatment with either PC61N297Q or PC612a affected IL-2

242

sensitivity, we performed similar dose-response experiments on cells isolated from mice 24h

243

after in vivo antibody treatment. Even at this early timepoint, PC61 had saturated all detectable

244

epitopes in mice treated with PC61N297Q or PC612a (Fig. S2B), and by 7D4 staining we observed

245

reduced CD25 expression in PC61N297Q-treated mice, and nearly complete depletion of CD25hi

246

Treg cells in PC612a-treated animals (Fig. 4H). IL-2 sensitivity of CD25lo, CD25mid and CD25hi

247

Treg cell populations from treated mice was reduced by about 50-fold (Fig. 4I). However, these

248

Treg cells were still more IL-2 responsive than both CD8+ Teff and NK cells (Fig. S2C). Again,

249

further addition of S4B6 to further block IL-2/CD25 interaction severely curtailed IL-2 signaling

250

in treated cells. Together, these data show that although PC61 does substantially reduce the

251

sensitivity of Treg cells to IL-2, sustained CD25 expression and function in PC61N297Q and

252

PC612a treated mice maintains the Treg cell-dominated hierarchy of access to IL-2 in vivo. This

253

continued IL-2 signaling likely underlies the Treg cell function that helps prevent the immune

254

dysregulation observed in anti-IL-2-treated animals.

Extended treatment with PC612a disrupts Treg cell-dependent immune homeostasis
While immune dysregulation was only apparent in the anti-IL-2 treated mice after one

257

week of treatment, we wondered if long-term inhibition of CD25 with the PC61N297Q or PC612a

258

antibodies would ultimately result in loss of Treg cell function. As we observed after one week,

259

the frequency of Treg cells was significantly decreased in mice treated with PC612a or anti-IL-2

260

for four weeks, and this predominantly impacted cTreg cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, prolonged

261

treatment also resulted in a small but significant decrease in Treg cell frequency in PC61N297Q

262

treated mice (Fig. 5A). However, absolute numbers of Treg cells in the spleen were diminished

263

only in the PC612a-treated mice. Endogenous STAT5 phosphorylation in Treg cells was

264

strikingly similar at four weeks compared to one week, but we now observed activation of cDC2

265

in both PC612a and anti-IL-2 treated animals, and enhanced activation of cDC1 and moDC in

266

anti-IL-2-treated mice (Fig. 5B). Accordingly, we detected increased frequencies and numbers of

267

CD44hiCD62Llo CD4+ (Fig. 5C) and CD44hi CD8+ (Fig. 5D) Teff cells in PC612a and anti-IL-2

268

treated mice, and this was associated with enhanced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine

269

IFN-γ by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5E, F). Therefore, continued IL-2 signaling after

270

Treg cell depletion with PC612a can preserve immune homeostasis only in the short term, while

271

even extended treatment with PC61N297Q does not lead to immune dysregulation.

Discussion
The importance of CD25 for Treg cell development, survival and suppressive function is

274

well established. Although genetic models using conditional ablation of CD25 on Treg cells

275

demonstrate this [42, 43], it is less clear how therapeutically inhibiting CD25 or IL-2 impacts

276

Treg cells. As the IL-2/CD25 axis is central to mediating immune homeostasis, a precise

277

understanding of how it could be targeted to treat human disease is critical. In this study, we

278

define a progressive cascade of immune dysregulation that occurs upon inhibition of the IL-

279

2/CD25 axis. Full IL-2 blockade results in both a numerical reduction of Treg cells and loss of

280

IL-2-dependent Treg cell functions, thereby leading to rapid immune dysregulation. By contrast,

281

although Treg cell depletion is numerically similar following PC612a treatment, immune

282

dysregulation is substantially delayed, likely due to the continued IL-2 signaling that supports the

283

function of the remaining Treg cells and potentially aided by depletion of CD25+ Teff cells.

284

Finally, although PC61N297Q reduces IL-2 sensitivity ~10-50-fold, this is not sufficient to upset

285

their competitive advantage over Teff cells and NK cells in accessing IL-2, and this has little

286

impact on immune regulation and Treg cell homeostasis even after prolonged treatment.

287

Whereas previous studies have struggled to distinguish requirements for IL-2 in earlier

288

developmental stages versus subsequent maintenance in adult peripheral immune tissue, we

289

demonstrate here that continued IL-2 signaling in the periphery is critical to maintain Treg cell

290

function. Although maintenance of eTreg cells in non-lymphoid tissues can be IL-2 independent

291

[34, 44], immune steady state in SLOs is rapidly disrupted when IL-2 is neutralized. DCs and

292

Treg cells are linked in a homeostatic loop [45], and work from our lab previously determined

293

that the frequency and function of IL-2 dependent Treg cells in the spleen depends on antigen

294

presentation to autoreactive CD4+ T cells largely by CD80/86-bearing cDC2s [9]. Here, we

295

extend these findings to show that when IL-2 is neutralized, costimulatory markers on cDC2s are

296

rapidly upregulated due to reduced functional capacity of the Treg cells in the absence of IL-2

297

signaling. These data mirror results from Chinen and colleagues [42], in which Treg cells with

298

constitutively active pSTAT5 had an enhanced ability to form conjugates with DCs, resulting in

299

their decreased expression of costimulatory molecules. Treg cells can outcompete naïve T cells

300

to bind to DCs [46], and modulate levels of costimulatory molecules on those DCs through

301

provision of the inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 [47, 48]. The higher Treg cell CTLA-4 expression

302

we observed in the PC612a-treated mice, where Treg cells are able to prevent upregulation of

303

costimulatory molecules on DCs and delay immune dysregulation in contrast to anti-IL-2-treated

304

mice, is likely due to sustained IL-2 signaling. IL-2-dependent regulation of other adhesion and

305

inhibitory molecules could also be involved in providing Treg cells’ enhanced ability to interact

306

with and even strip MHCII-peptide from DCs [49] in order to limit priming of conventional T

307

cells and maintain immune homeostasis.

308

We further show that Treg cells maintain substantial CD25 function and selective access

309

to IL-2 in a CD25-dependent manner in the presence of PC61, critically clarifying the effects of

310

this commonly used antibody in murine models. Our data strongly support the conclusion that

311

any effects observed in mice treated with PC61 must be due to active depletion of CD25hi Treg

312

cells, and conclusions made in previous studies based on the ability of PC61 to inhibit CD25

313

function on Treg cells should be re-evaluated [31, 32]. Vargas and colleagues recently

314

demonstrated that tumor-bearing mice treated with a strong depleting CD25 antibody have a

315

significant reduction of intra-tumoral Treg cells and subsequent improved control of tumors,

316

while a non-depleting CD25 antibody has no effect [50]. In cancer therapy this result is

317

desirable. In contrast, more subtle inhibition of the IL-2/CD25 axis, such as treatment with

318

PC61N297Q, may be more advantageous for treatment of autoimmunity. For instance, we found

319

that continued IL-2 signaling in splenocytes treated with PC61 was skewed towards the highest

320

CD25 expressing Treg cells compared to the untreated controls. This could be beneficial in an

321

autoimmune setting, particularly in humans where CD25 is expressed on CD56bright NK cells and

322

activated T cells, but at a lower level than on Treg cells [51]. The presence of PC61N297Q could

323

therefore allow a further advantage for Treg cells to preferentially access IL-2 over other effector

324

cells, and improve tolerance in a mechanism similar to Treg selective IL-2 ‘muteins’ [52, 53].

325

In humans, the anti-CD25 antibodies daclizumab and basilixumab have been used as anti-

326

inflammatory agents to treat MS and prevent graft rejection. This is somewhat counterintuitive

327

given the central role of IL-2/CD25 in maintaining immune tolerance, and the mechanisms of

328

action of these drugs is not well understood. Unlike PC61, these antibodies directly bind to and

329

occlude the IL-2 binding site of CD25, and this results in a reduction in Treg cell frequency

330

(although these cells retain function [54, 55]), increased serum levels of IL-2, and an IL-2-

331

dependent increase in CD56bright NK cells [56-59]. The increase in CD56bright NK cells correlates

332

positively with therapeutic response in patients with MS. While normally thought to be

333

regulatory and more immature, CD56bright NK cells expanded in daclizumab treated patients

334

display enhanced expression of activation markers and receptors that mediate NK cell activation

335

and cytolytic capacity [60], and in vitro studies indicate the ability of these NK cells to kill

336

activated and perhaps encephalitogenic T cells [57, 61]. This increase in bioavailable IL-2

337

presumably would not occur in patients treated with a CD25 antibody that allowed Tregs to

338

maintain normal levels of signaling, like PC61N297Q. While NK cells appear to have a beneficial

339

therapeutic effect, it is also possible they are contributing to adverse events in these treated

340

patients, such as dermatitis, malignancies, infections, and encephalitis [26, 62]. Identification of

17
341

antibodies that limit CD25 function but allow Treg cells to maintain their selective access to IL-2

342

may also be therapeutically beneficial in autoimmunity for limiting Teff cell and NK cell

343

responses while maintaining robust Treg cell function.

344

Targeting of the IL-2/CD25 axis holds incredible promise for treatment of immune

345

dysfunction. Our study emphasizes the complexity of this pathway, and that changes in the

346

sensitivity of cells to IL-2 can produce strikingly different effects on the immune system. Total

347

blockade of IL-2 results in rapid immune dysregulation, while residual CD25 function, even in

348

the face of inhibitory or depleting antibodies, can maintain Treg cell preferential access to IL-2

349

and therefore allow preservation of immune homeostasis to varying degrees. Subtle differences

350

in CD25 antibody specificity could result in a wide range of beneficial outcomes, and could

351

therefore be utilized to maximize therapeutic benefit.

Materials and Methods

353

Mice

354

C57BL/6 (B6) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. DO11.10/Rag2-/- mice were

355

provided by S. Ziegler (Benaroya Research Institute), and soluble OVA (sOVA) mice were

356

provided by A. Abbas (University of California, San Francisco). All mice were bred and

357

maintained at Benaroya Research Institute, and experiments were pre-approved by the Office of

358

Animal Care and Use Committee of Benaroya Research Institute. Mice used in experiments were

359

between 6-20 weeks of age at time of sacrifice.

360

Flow cytometry

361

For DC isolations, minced whole spleens were digested in basal RPMI supplemented with 2.5

362

mg/mL Collagenase D for 20 minutes under agitation at 37°C. Cell suspensions were then passed

363

through 70 µm strainers into RPMI + 10% FBS (RPMI-10). Erythrocytes were lysed in ACK

364

lysis buffer, and the remaining cells were washed in RPMI-10. DCs were enriched using CD11c-

365

microbeads (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cell surface staining for flow

366

cytometry was performed in FACS buffer (PBS-2% BCS) using the following antibody clones:

pSTAT5 (47/pStat5[pY694]), IFN-γ (XMG1.2), and CTLA-4 (UC10-4F10-11). Flow cytometry

376

data was analyzed using FlowJo software.

377

Ex vivo staining

378

To assess pSTAT5 levels directly ex vivo, spleens were immediately disrupted between glass

379

slides into eBioscience FixPerm. Cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, washed

380

in FACS buffer, resuspended in 500 µL 90% methanol (MeOH), and incubated on ice for at least

381

30 minutes. Cells were stained with surface and intracellular antigens, including pSTAT5

382

(pY694) for 45 minutes at room temperature.

383

In vitro assays

384

For in vitro CD25 blockade, splenocytes were isolated from untreated B6 mice as described.

385

5x105 cells were plated per well into a 96-well round bottom plate. Commercially available PC61

386

(BioXcell) was added to designated wells at 1µg/mL final concentration, and samples were

387

incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then washed. Meanwhile, 1000 U/mL recombinant IL-2

388

(eBioscience) was incubated with 50 µg/mL S4B6-1 (BioXcell) for 30 minutes at room

389

temperature. rIL-2:S4B6 complexes were then serially diluted 10-fold to achieve all desired

390

concentrations for the experiment. rIL-2 without S4B6 was subject to the same treatment. rIL-2

391

or rIL-2:S4B6 dilutions were then added to appropriate wells and samples were incubated at

392

37°C for 30 min. Samples were then washed and fixed with FixPerm (eBioscience) for 20 min at

393

room temp, washed and incubated in 500 µL MeOH on ice for at least 30 min, washed and

394

finally stained with antibodies for 45 min at room temp. For in vivo CD25 blockade, animals

395

were injected intraperitoneally as described with 500 µg PC61N297Q or PC612a. Spleens were

396

harvested 24 hours after injection, and in vitro response to IL-2 was measured as described above

397

(without any incubation with commercial PC61).
