Abstract

22

Understanding ecological drivers of mosquito-borne disease is an ongoing public

23

health priority. Previous experiments and mechanistic models suggest mosquito-

24

borne disease transmission involves complex nonlinear interactions between

25

climate and population dynamics. This makes detecting environmental disease

26

drivers at the population level challenging. By analyzing incidence data, estimated

27

susceptible population size, and climate data with methods based on nonlinear time

28

series analysis, collectively referred to as empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), we

29

identified drivers and their interactive effects on dengue dynamics in San Juan,

30

Puerto Rico. Estimated susceptible population size was the strongest causal driver

31

of dengue incidence, and climatic forcing became important above a certain

32

susceptible population size (temperature and rainfall having net positive and

33

negative effects, respectively). Our EDM protocol for measuring and predicting how

34

climate and population dynamics interact to drive epidemics adds to a growing body

35

of empirical studies of complex, nonlinear systems embedded in changing

36

environments.

INTRODUCTION

38

Mosquito-borne diseases, and dengue in particular, are (re)emerging globally and

39

spreading to higher latitudes in concert with globalization and climate change

40

(Kilpatrick & Randolph 2012; Ryan et al. 2019). Dengue virus—transmitted

41

primarily by urban Aedes aegypti (Kraemer et al. 2015b)—places half of the global

42

human population in 128 countries at infection risk (Brady et al. 2012; Kraemer et

43

al. 2019) and causes an estimated 390 million annual cases of dengue fever

44

worldwide (Bhatt et al. 2013). In the absence of effective vaccines or treatments

45

(Katzelnick et al. 2017b, a; Sridhar et al. 2018), public health agencies rely on vector

46

control to reduce dengue transmission (Erlanger et al. 2008). Effective vector

47

control measures require understanding the mechanisms linking vector ecology and

48

epidemics to better predict disease outbreaks—a major research challenge.

49

Previous prediction models used phenomenological and mechanistic equation-

50

based approaches (Johansson et al. 2009; Hii et al. 2012; Tran et al. 2013; Liu-

51

Helmersson et al. 2014; Morin et al. 2015; Mordecai et al. 2017; Johnson et al. 2018),

52

which may not fully capture interdependence between predictors. Here, we used a

53

mechanistic, equation-free, data-driven approach that accounts for interdependence

54

to determine ecological drivers and predict dengue outbreaks in an urban

55

environment.

56

Since mosquitoes have been shown to be sensitive to climate variables, such as

57

temperature and rainfall (Ibarra et al. 2013; Mordecai et al. 2019), it is reasonable to

58

ask whether temperature and rainfall are important drivers of dengue outbreaks.

59

Although temperature directly affects mosquito and viral traits in laboratory

60

experiments (Watts et al. 1987; Lambrechts et al. 2011), the relationship between

61

temperature and dengue incidence in the field has been ambiguous. Thus,

62

temperature-dependent models have had mixed success predicting the timing and

63

magnitudes of epidemics (Hii et al. 2012; Johansson et al. 2016; Johnson et al. 2018).

64

Similarly, the rainfall–dengue relationship is complex, because the effect of rainfall

65

on mosquitoes depends on local breeding habitat and human behavior. In some

66

settings, rainfall provides more container breeding habitat for mosquitoes, thus

67

increasing mosquito abundance and dengue incidence (Ibarra et al. 2013). By

68

contrast, low rainfall levels could also facilitate dengue transmission by promoting

69

water storage that serves as standing-water habitat for mosquito breeding

70

(Oliveira-lima et al. 2000). Further, heavy rainfall can reduce mosquito abundance

71

by flushing out larvae (Koenraadt & Harrington 2008). The net effect of climate on

72

dengue is a convolution of many different mechanisms of action, and the net

73

outcome depends on specific context details. Moreover, as these details change, the

74

climate–dengue relationship can change.

75

Previous studies using statistical (Johansson et al. 2009; Hii et al. 2012; Liu-

76

Helmersson et al. 2014; Johnson et al. 2018) and mechanistic models (Tran et al.

77

2013; Morin et al. 2015; Mordecai et al. 2017) suggest that temperature and rainfall

78

drive dengue transmission in the field. However, these models rely on parameter

79

estimates from laboratory studies that are engineered to isolate single mechanisms

80

of action, hence producing separable relationships between drivers and dengue,

81

eliminating the complex interdependence at the population level. While laboratory

82

studies provide robust validation of a mechanism (Lambrechts et al. 2011), the fixed

83

relationships (correlations) taken from them do not necessarily translate into

84

proper causal inference for nonlinear field systems (Sugihara et al. 2012). Even if

85

causality exists between two variables in such a system, their correlation can switch

86

signs during different time periods, resulting in a net correlation of zero (Deyle et al.

87

2016b). This temporal variation in the direction of correlation results from the

88

nonlinear, state-dependent relationship between the variables (i.e., the importance

89

or direction of one effect depends on the state of another variable). Conversely, even

90

if two variables are consistently correlated, the association could be spurious due to

91

a confounder—a third variable that drives two otherwise unrelated variables. Thus,

92

covariation among variables poses a problem for identifying causal drivers. Both

93

temperature and rainfall follow seasonal patterns in most regions of the world and

94

often covary, making it difficult to separate their effects. Since ecological systems

95

are often nonlinear with covarying drivers, it is difficult to isolate causality from

96

field data.

97

Disease incidence also depends nonlinearly on (potentially climate-driven)

98

transmission rates, because epidemic growth slows as the population of susceptible

99

individuals is exhausted (Rypdal & Sugihara 2019). Thus, susceptible population

100

size is an important driver of infectious disease dynamics (Anderson & May 1979;

101

Kraemer et al. 2015a; Rypdal & Sugihara 2019). Variation in susceptible host

102

availability may influence the effects of climate on dengue dynamics, but such

103

interactive effects are difficult to detect in observational data. A lack of rigorous

104

methods has hindered research on potential interdependence of climate and

105

susceptible population size as drivers of dengue incidence. Because correlations are

106

unreliable and variables are interdependent in nature, disentangling climate from

107

other drivers in disease systems remains challenging (Thai & Anders 2011; Morin et

108

al. 2013).

109

To overcome these challenges, we used empirical dynamic modeling (EDM)

110

(Sugihara et al. 2012) to identify and model causal mechanisms driving dengue

111

epidemics (see http://tinyurl.com/EDM-intro for an introduction). EDM differs from

112

statistical and equation-based mechanistic models in two key ways. First, unlike

113

statistical approaches where inferences about cause-and-effect relationships are

114

based on fixed independent pairwise associations between system variables, EDM is

115

based on reconstructing the system dynamics. This allows relationships among

116

system variables to change through time to reflect that interactions among variables

117

are changing. Second, unlike equation-based mechanistic models, EDM does not

118

require assumptions about the functional form of the model, but instead

119

reconstructs the dynamic attractor empirically from time series observations. An

120

attractor is a geometric object (i.e., curve or manifold) that embodies the rules for

121

how relationships among variables change with respect to each other through time

122

depending on system state (specific location on the attractor). Like a set of

123

equations, the geometric attractor encompasses the dynamics of a system, and thus

124

can provide an agnostic (without an assumed set of equations) yet mechanistic

125

understanding of the system that is empirically based. Although traditional

126

equation-based mechanistic models can be constructed to account for nonlinearity,

127

these approaches require a priori assumptions about the identity and the form of

the causal relationships between variables that may not hold; however, EDM does

129

not rely on such assumptions.

130

Here, we use EDM and a recent approach for inferring the susceptible population

131

size from incidence data (Rypdal & Sugihara 2019) to answer three questions: (1)

132

Do temperature, rainfall and/or inferred susceptible population size drive dengue

133

incidence? (2) Can we predict dengue dynamics using climate data and inferred

134

susceptible population size? (3) What is the approximate pattern of each causal

135

relationship, and how is this relationship influenced by the other drivers? We

136

examine the hypothesis that temperature and rainfall drive dengue incidence in

137

complex ways that depend on susceptible population size. The EDM protocol

138

presented here—identifying drivers, their predictive power, and state-dependent

139

functional responses—can be applied to other complex, ecological systems.

METHODS

141

Data and proxy for susceptible population size

142

We obtained time series of weekly observations of dengue incidence (total number

143

of new dengue cases of all serotypes), temperature (℃), and rainfall (mm) in San

144

Juan, Puerto Rico, 1990–2009 (Figure 1a–c) from the National Oceanic and

145

Atmospheric Administration on November 10, 2016

146

(http://dengueforecasting.noaa.gov/). Direct measurement of susceptible

147

populations is not feasible, so we used a recently developed method for inferring a

148

proxy for the susceptible population size (Rypdal & Sugihara 2019). This method

149

uses incidence data during the inter-outbreak period to construct a time series for

150

the susceptible population. Although few dengue cases occur during the inter-

151

outbreak period, incidence during this time contains information about the

152

susceptible population size in the next outbreak. Because during an inter-outbreak

153

period the disease system fluctuates around a disease-free equilibrium, a linear

154

approximation of the incidence rate can be made where the coefficient, i.e., the

155

leading eigenvalue, 𝜆, scales linearly with the susceptible population size. If we

156

assume a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model (Kermack &

157

McKendrick 1927) for the disease system, then
𝜆 = 𝛽𝑆& − 𝛾

(1)

158

where 𝑆& is a parameter representing the susceptible population size, 𝛽 is the force of

159

infection, and 𝛾 is the recovery rate. Thus, 𝜆 is linearly related to the proportion of

160

the population that is susceptible over time, and can be used as a proxy (see

161

Supporting Information for details).

162

Since the weekly incidence data are discrete we need to obtain the discrete-time

163

eigenvalue 𝜆& = 𝑒 *∆, . To infer 𝜆& from the weekly incidence data 𝐼(𝑡), we performed

164

linear regression by fitting the statistical model 𝐼(𝑡 + Δ𝑡) = 𝜆& 𝐼(𝑡) for 12 time

165

points in a 12-week running window (∆𝑡 = 1 week). The model is robust to the

166

window size (Rypdal & Sugihara 2019). In the discrete case, when 𝜆& < 1 the system

167

is stable (inter-outbreak period) and when 𝜆& ≥ 1 then the system is unstable

168

(outbreak period). Here, we treated the resulting time series of 𝜆& as a proxy for the

169

susceptible population size, or “susceptibles index” for short (Figure 1d).

170

Statistical analyses

171

All analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.1 (R Development Core Team 2018).

172

We performed pairwise cross-correlations on the time series to investigate time-

173

lagged relationships between potential drivers (i.e., temperature, rainfall, and

174

susceptibles index) and dengue incidence using the tseries package version 0.10-

175

45 (Trapletti & Hornik 2018). We calculated the interannual mean to obtain the

176

seasonal variability for each variable. Determining whether the variables follow

177

seasonal trends is important for EDM analyses. Before performing EDM, we

178

normalized each time series to zero mean and unit variance to remove

179

measurement unit bias, ensuring the variables would be comparable and the

180

attractor would not be distorted.

181

Empirical dynamic modeling (EDM)

182

All EDM analyses were performed using package rEDM version 0.7.1 (Ye et al. 2018).

183

EDM includes approaches to infer a system’s mechanistic underpinnings and predict

184

its dynamics. EDM uses time series data of one or more variables to construct an

185

attractor in state space (Figure S1). This is called univariable or multivariable state

186

space reconstruction (SSR) for an attractor built using a single or multiple variables,

187

respectively. Properties of the attractor are assessed to examine characteristics of

188

the system (Deyle & Sugihara 2011).

189

EDM is sensitive to stochasticity, and should be applied in systems where there is

190

evidence of deterministic dynamics (Cummins et al. 2015). Some stochasticity is

191

allowed (e.g., there can be stochastic drivers in the system), but the system cannot

192

be entirely stochastic (i.e., there must be low-dimensional deterministic structure to

193

most variables). To test for low-dimensional deterministic dynamics we performed

194

univariable SSR for each variable and used simplex projection (Sugihara & May

195

1990)—a type of nearest neighbor regression—to check that the prediction skill

196

decreases with time to prediction, an indicator of deterministic dynamics (Figures

197

S2a and S4; see Supporting Information for details). To test for nonlinear state

198

dependence of a variable—the motivation behind EDM—we used the S-map test for

199

nonlinearity (Sugihara 1994) (Figures S2b,c and S5; see Supporting Information for

200

details).

EDM: Convergent cross-mapping

202

We used an EDM approach called convergent cross-mapping (CCM) (Sugihara et al.

203

2012) to identify drivers of dengue incidence. If two variables are causally related,

204

then a multivariable attractor—where each variable in the system represents a

205

dimension that traces the dynamics of the system—can be semi-reconstructed using

206

lagged versions of just one of the variables (Figure S1). Based on Takens’ Theorem,

207

this univariable “shadow attractor” preserves the structural and dynamic properties

208

of the original multivariable attractor (Takens 1981) [see video

209

https://youtu.be/QQwtrWBwxQg (Sugihara et al. 2012)]. The concept behind CCM

210

is that if temperature causes dengue incidence, then information about temperature

211

will be embedded in the dynamics of dengue, such that the shadow attractor

212

produced using only dengue dynamics allows us to accurately reconstruct

213

temperature in the past. However, the converse scenario would not be true: since

214

dengue does not cause temperature, the shadow attractor constructed using

215

temperature data should not contain information to accurately reconstruct dengue

216

incidence (see Supporting Information for details).

217

The critical criterion for testing the existence of causality using CCM is checking that

218

the cross-mapping skill monotonically increases and plateaus (i.e., converges) with

219

the length of the response variable data series used in cross-mapping. The cross-

220

mapping skill, ρ, is the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between predicted driver

221

values using the univariable SSR of the response variable, and the observed driver

222

values. We used the Kendall’s 𝜏 test as a significance test for convergence using the
11

223

Kendall package version 2.2 (McLeod 2011). This test checks whether cross-

224

mapping skill has a significant monotonic increasing trend. If 𝜏 > 0 then there is

225

convergence (Grziwotz et al. 2018).

226

Based on the cross-correlation analyses (Figure S6), we applied a 9-week time lag

227

between temperature and incidence, an averaged lag of 3–9 weeks for rainfall, and a

228

5-week lag for the susceptibles index. The rainfall variable is a proxy for standing

229

water as mosquito breeding habitat, and thus we were interested in the

230

accumulation of water over time. We refer to these as “ecological lags” and treat

231

them as proxies for the time delay of cause-and-effect, since they account for the

232

ecological processes in the causal chain of events (ecological lags are separate from

233

lags used in SSR). These ecological time lags are consistent with results from other

234

field studies, which showed that temperature and rainfall predict dengue cases 6–12

235

weeks ahead (Chen et al. 2010; Ibarra et al. 2013).

236

EDM: Null models

237

For CCM, we assessed the strength of the evidence for causal effects of potential

238

drivers on dengue using two null models that control for the seasonal trend

239

observed in all variables (Figure 2). These null models address the sensitivity of

240

CCM to periodic fluctuations (i.e., seasonality), which can make two variables appear

241

to be causally linked when instead they are simply synchronized by an unobserved

242

seasonal variable (Cobey & Baskerville 2016; Deyle et al. 2016a). In the first null

243

model (“seasonal null model”), we preserved the seasonal signal in the null, but

244

randomized the interannual anomalies, and compared model performance with the
12

245

true time series (Deyle et al. 2016a). In the second, more conservative null model

246

(“Ebisuzaki null model”), we conserved any serial correlation (beyond seasonal) and

247

randomized the phases of Fourier transformed time series, and compared model

248

performance with the true time series (Ebisuzaki 1997).

249

We also repeated the CCM method in the nonsensical, reverse-causal direction (e.g.,

250

to test whether incidence drives climate) as a control for potential spurious

251

relationships generated by non-causal covariation (e.g., due to seasonality). This

252

addresses the issue of synchrony, in which CCM can indicate bidirectional causality

253

when one direction is false or nonsensical (Baskerville & Cobey 2017; Sugihara et al.

254

2017).

255

EDM: Forecast improvement

256

We examined the predictive power of each driver—or combination of drivers—on

257

dengue incidence by assessing how well we can predict dengue dynamics using

258

temperature, rainfall, and susceptibles index. We used a combination of univariable

259

SSR (i.e., with incidence data) and multivariable SSR to determine the improvement

260

of forecasting (using simplex projection) when including each driver or combination

261

of drivers (Dixon et al. 1999; Deyle et al. 2013, 2016a).

262

We investigated the potential forecast improvement of dengue incidence using

263

temperature, rainfall, susceptibles index, and their combined effect. In addition, we

264

investigated the predictive power of dengue incidence using multivariable SSR with

just the potential driver variables: temperature, rainfall, and susceptibles index (see

266

Supporting Information).

267

EDM: Scenario exploration

268

In nonlinear systems, drivers generally do not have a constant effect. The effect is

269

state-dependent—the strength and possibly the direction of the effect depends on

270

the current state of the system. Scenario exploration with multivariable EDM

271

allowed us to assess the effect of a small change in temperature or rainfall on

272

dengue incidence, across different states of the system. The outcome of these small

273

changes allowed us to deduce the relationship between each climate driver and

274

dengue incidence and how they depend on the system state. For each time step t we

275

used S-maps (Sugihara 1994; Deyle et al. 2016a) to predict dengue incidence using a

276

small increase (+ΔX/2) and a small decrease (–ΔX/2) of the observed value of driver

277

𝑋(𝑡) (temperature or rainfall). For each putative climate driver, the difference in

278

dengue predictions between these small changes is Δ𝑌 = 𝑌(𝑡 + 1) <𝑋(𝑡) +

279

𝑌(𝑡 + 1) <𝑋(𝑡) −

280

and we used ΔY/ΔX to approximate the effect of driver X at time t. We repeated this

281

over all time steps in our time series data for both temperature and rainfall to

282

recover their approximate relationships with dengue incidence at different states of

283

the system. Scenario exploration analyses were repeated across several model

284

parameterizations to address potential sensitivity to parameter settings (see

RESULTS

287

Detecting drivers

288

EDM showed that temperature, rainfall, and susceptibles index drive dengue

289

incidence since the convergence criterion was met (Kendall’s 𝜏 > 0, p < 0.01) in all

290

three CCM cases (Figure 3a–c). Rainfall and susceptibles index were significant

291

drivers of dengue incidence beyond seasonality, as their effects were

292

distinguishable from seasonal and Ebisuzaki null models (Figures 3b, c and S8b, c; p

293

< 0.05). This implies significant causal effects of both rainfall and susceptible

294

population size on dengue, which are not obscured by a confounder with a periodic

295

signal. However, temperature was not a significant driver beyond seasonality

296

(Figures 3a and S8a; p > 0.05). This implies we cannot rule out the possibility that

297

the apparent forcing of temperature on dengue is due to a confounder with a

298

seasonal signal. However, if there is no such confounder, then the seasonal trend in

299

temperature, which accounts for most temperature variation in San Juan, drives the

300

seasonal trend observed in dengue incidence (i.e., seasonality of temperature drives

301

seasonality of dengue). Compared to the other drivers, the predictive skill of the

302

temperature null model was relatively high (Figure 3a), suggesting that temperature

303

seasonality in the null model was predictive. This further supports the notion that

304

seasonal temperature may be driving dengue dynamics.

305

As expected, EDM tests for causality in the nonsensical directions—incidence

306

driving temperature or rainfall—were not significant (i.e., no convergence; Figure

S7, black lines). This further supports that temperature and rainfall drive dengue

308

incidence, because their causal relationships were not confounded by spurious

309

bidirectionality. Further, the null models for the nonsensical directions of causality

310

(Figure S7, grey lines) also displayed no convergence (completely flat), as expected

311

(i.e., seasonality of dengue incidence does not drive seasonality of temperature or

312

rainfall). However, seasonality (or any periodicity) of temperature, rainfall and

313

susceptibles index drive dengue dynamics, shown by convergence of the seasonal

314

and Ebisuzaki null models (grey lines in Figures 3 and S8).

315

Predictive power of drivers

316

Dengue incidence was highly predictable using univariable SSR of incidence data

317

alone (Adjusted R2 = 0.8922, 𝜌 = 0.9446; Figure 4a). The predictive power of dengue

318

incidence improved only slightly when temperature, rainfall, and susceptibles index

319

were added in a multivariable SSR model (Adjusted R2 = 0.8927, 𝜌 = 0.9448; Figure

320

4d). These results suggest that dengue incidence time series contain information

321

about these drivers, resulting in the high predictability of the attractor in

322

univariable SSR (Figure 4a).

323

Dengue dynamics were also highly predictable using only the driver time series (i.e.,

324

temperature, rainfall, and susceptibles index) in a multivariable SSR model

325

(Adjusted R2 = 0.5044, 𝜌 = 0.7102; Figure 4c), where timing and magnitude of

326

epidemics were captured reasonably well. However, the model using only

327

temperature and rainfall data did not predict dengue incidence as well (Adjusted R2

328

= 0.0533, 𝜌 = 0.2309; Figure 4b). Thus, adding the susceptibles index increases

329

predictive power compared to climate variables alone, particularly for predicting

330

the magnitude of outbreaks (Figure 4c). However, temperature and rainfall did

331

capture the timing (seasonality) of the epidemics (Figure 4b). This supports the

332

notion that seasonality of temperature and rainfall is important for explaining the

333

seasonality of dengue, and that susceptible population size is important for

334

determining epidemic size. All SSR models (Figure 4a–d) had significant (p < 0.001)

335

F statistics >> 1 from ANOVA, rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., no relationship

336

between predicted and observed dengue incidence).

337

State-dependent functional responses

338

By investigating the rate of change of dengue incidence as a function of climate

339

across system states, we found that temperature had a small positive median effect

340

(0.0035, Wilcox p < 0.001) on dengue incidence. A positive effect is expected

341

(Mordecai et al. 2017) for the temperature range in Puerto Rico (Figure S9, black

342

dashed lines), although the effect was occasionally much stronger, both positive and

343

negative (Figure 5a, b). The large negative effects occurred only at the highest

344

temperature values (as predicted by mechanistic models of temperature-dependent

345

transmission), reinforced by a lower quantile regression with a strongly negative

346

slope (Figure 5b, bottom dashed red line). However, positive effects occurred across

347

the whole temperature range.

348

Rainfall had a small negative median effect (–0.0022, Wilcox p < 0.001), but

349

occasionally had very large negative effects (Figure 5a, c). These large, negative

350

effects of rainfall on dengue occurred when there was less than 100 mm of rain per

351

week (Figure 5c), in line with expectations that low amounts of rainfall could lead to

352

high number of dengue cases, since people tend to store water in containers during

353

periods of drought, enabling mosquitoes to breed (Oliveira-lima et al. 2000). There

354

are also small positive effects of rainfall on dengue (Figure 5c), suggesting that

355

overall the results showed competing effects of low–moderate rain providing

356

standing water for mosquito breeding and humans storing standing water where

357

mosquitoes can breed when there is drought or low rain.

358

The results on climate effects suggest that the strength and direction of the effects of

359

climate on dengue dynamics depend on the state of the system. A potential cause of

360

state-dependent climate effects on dengue dynamics is the variation in the

361

susceptible population size over time (Figure 6a, b). Outbreaks do not occur when

362

there are too few susceptible people to get infected. As expected, when the

363

susceptible population size was small (𝜆& < 0.85) incidence was insensitive to

364

climate (Figure 6c, e). By contrast, when the susceptible population size was large

365

(𝜆& > 0.85), temperature and rainfall effects on dengue incidence appeared (Figure

366

6d, f). The gradual increase and decrease of the rate of change of dengue as a

367

function of temperature (Figure 6d, red solid lines) aligned well with the sigmoidal

368

part (Figure S9, black dashed lines representing the temperature range in our

369

study) of the unimodal temperature response curve (assuming transmission

370

primarily by Ae. aegypti) developed previously (Mordecai et al. 2017). This is an

371

important finding, since evidence of climate functional responses for disease

372

dynamics is rare due to the difficulty of obtaining appropriately informative field

374

spectrum—possibly by assembling data across multiple climates—that the

375

empirical functional response derived from EDM would also look unimodal.

DISCUSSION

377

EDM can identify causal drivers, quantify their predictive power, and approximate

378

functional responses in nonlinear, state-dependent ecological systems, which few

379

other methods can do. Infectious disease dynamics are often seasonal, adding

380

another layer of complexity. Here, we used seasonal null models and a well-studied

381

ecological system to disentangle nonlinear and interactive mechanisms driving

382

disease dynamics. First, EDM detected rainfall, susceptible population size, and

383

plausibly temperature (mostly via its seasonality) as drivers of dengue incidence.

384

The seasonal variation in incidence was more attributed to climate, while the

385

interannual variation in incidence was more explained by the susceptible

386

population (Figure 3). Second, EDM provided a predictive model based on these

387

three drivers that had a reasonably good fit to dengue incidence data (R2 = 0.50, 𝜌 =

388

0.71; Figure 4c). Dengue dynamics were also highly predictable from incidence data

389

alone (R2 = 0.89, 𝜌 = 0. 94; Figure 4a); thus, robust to missing state variables. This

390

implies that EDM methods could be powerful for forecasting epidemics, provided

391

that surveillance efforts continue to report weekly case data. Third, EDM revealed

392

that climate effects on dengue appeared once the susceptible population size

393

exceeded a threshold (𝜆& > 0.85; Figure 6).

394

The fact that climate effects are observed before the onset of an outbreak, when 𝜆& =

395

1 (Rypdal & Sugihara 2019), suggests that rainfall, and possibly temperature, have

396

an effect on the timing of an impending epidemic. Thus, although rainfall and

397

temperature might not influence the dynamics of dengue during an inter-outbreak

398

period when the susceptible population size is small, climate could act as a catalyst

399

to spark an epidemic once the susceptible population size is large enough. This

400

resonates with the notion that climate could drive the force of infection, 𝛽, thus

401

influencing the susceptibles index, 𝜆 (Rypdal & Sugihara 2019). The timing of an

402

outbreak, when 𝜆 ≥ 0 (or in the discrete case when 𝜆& ≥ 1), could be attributed to

403

the changes in 𝛽 caused by seasonal climatic drivers (Rypdal & Sugihara 2019).

404

Further, seasonality of temperature and rainfall had higher predictive skill than

405

seasonality of susceptibles index (Figures 3 and S8, grey solid lines); however,

406

adding susceptibles index dramatically improved dengue forecasts due to more

407

accurate epidemic magnitudes (Figure 4b, c). Thus, climate may be mostly

408

responsible for the timing of seasonal epidemics, while susceptible population size

409

may mostly determine the epidemic magnitude. Using the same dataset, Johnson et

410

al. (2018) found that mechanistic models could predict the timing of seasonal

411

epidemics, but that a phenomenological machine learning component was needed to

412

capture interannual variation in epidemic magnitude. Our work suggests that the

413

unobserved size of the susceptible population was a key missing link for predicting

414

magnitude variation across years.

415

We showed that susceptible population size is an important modifier of climate

416

effects on dengue (Figure 6). This climate–susceptible population interdependence

417

might be generalizable across other infectious diseases. For example, for influenza

418

dynamics, population density in cities—potentially a proxy for susceptible

419

population density—modulated climate effects on disease transmission (Dalziel et

420

al. 2018). Given complex immune and serotype dynamics of dengue (Katzelnick et
21

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.20.883363; this version posted December 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint

421

al. 2017b), total population density might not work as a proxy for the susceptible

422

population density in dengue dynamics. It has been difficult for previous

423

mechanistic models to capture susceptible dynamics for dengue. By inferring the

424

susceptibles index from incidence data (Rypdal & Sugihara 2019), we were able to

425

capture the strong influence of the susceptible population size on dengue dynamics,

426

which in turn moderated the effect of climate drivers on dengue dynamics. We

427

showed that climate–dengue relationships were only detectable once we accounted

428

for seasonal and interannual variation in susceptible availability (Figure 6d, f). This

429

is expected from theory (Kermack & McKendrick 1927; Xu et al. 2017), but

430

demonstrating it empirically is a unique contribution of this study.

431

Even when accounting for susceptible availability, the effects of temperature and

432

rainfall on dengue were still strongly state-dependent (Figure 6d, f). The remaining

433

variation in temperature and rainfall effects on dengue—given that the susceptible

434

population is large enough for an outbreak—may be partially explained by variation

435

in temperature and rainfall over time and space that is not captured by weekly

436

climate averages, and by interactions between temperature and rainfall. Further,

437

any subtle lagged effects of temperature or rainfall on dengue are not captured by a

438

single ecological lag (a 9-week or an averaged 3–9-week lag, respectively). We

439

expect multiple time lags to operate based on the different ecological processes that

440

generate reported cases: mosquito population growth, mosquitoes getting infected

441

and biting susceptible humans, development of symptoms, and care-seeking. The

442

ecological lags are simple proxies for this complex set of ecological processes.

443

EDM is like any other quantitative method in that it is appropriately applied when

444

its assumptions are met. EDM is sensitive to stochasticity and synchrony (e.g., via

445

seasonality), so it is important to first determine whether a system is governed by

446

deterministic dynamics, and then to use null models that account for synchrony

447

(Ebisuzaki 1997; Deyle et al. 2016a; Chang et al. 2017). Nevertheless, EDM is a

448

useful approach for testing causality between hypothesized drivers and response

449

variables in a dynamic system, and recent work allows EDM to perform well with

450

stochasticity (Cenci & Saavedra 2018; Cenci et al. 2019). To infer strongly supported

451

causal relationships, it is also important to consider the mechanistic hypotheses

452

underlying the system. For dengue, there are complementary lines of evidence

453

about the drivers of incidence from experimental studies (Watts et al. 1987;

454

Lambrechts et al. 2011), mechanistic models parameterized with data (Otero et al.

455

2006; Mordecai et al. 2017), phenomenological studies across settings (Johansson et

456

al. 2009; Hii et al. 2012; Ibarra et al. 2013), and EDM from this study. In particular,

457

the 19-year weekly time series dataset used here has been investigated using

458

multiple methods (Johansson et al. 2019); however, most of these methods are

459

either not mechanistic or include simple mechanisms that do not account for the

460

joint influence of climate and susceptible dynamics. EDM gives us the opportunity to

461

infer mechanisms, and assess their support in other studies using different

462

approaches. In sum, EDM has limitations, but the limitations of other approaches are

463

at least as great, and may not capture state-dependent effects. When combined with

464

supporting evidence from other approaches, EDM can be a powerful test for

causality, prediction, and functional relationships between drivers and response

466

variables.

467

Connecting climate and dengue at the population level is challenging, because causal

468

relationships are likely to be nonlinear and state-dependent. Thus, a toolbox of

469

rigorous methods for testing hypotheses, understanding mechanisms, and making

470

predictions is essential for understanding disease dynamics in complex, natural

471

populations. Ultimately, understanding how climate-driven vector-borne diseases

472

are influenced by other variables, such as susceptible population size, is important

473

for optimizing vector control under critical conditions where climate might spark

474

epidemics. EDM is most appropriate for deterministic systems, which are common

475

in disease ecology. The mechanisms inferred from EDM could be applied to

476

understand and predict future ecological responses to changing environments,

477

including dengue epidemics in a world undergoing global change.

697

drivers on dengue. Boxplots show that the median effects of rainfall (Rain) and

698

temperature (Temp) are small (close to zero), but drivers occasionally have strong

699

impacts (a). To investigate climate driver functional responses, we plotted the rate

700

of change of dengue incidence as a function of temperature (b) and the rate of

701

change of dengue incidence as a function of rainfall (c). Red and blue lines represent

702

regression on the median for temperature and rainfall, respectively. The dashed red

703

and blue lines represent regression on the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles of temperature

704

and rainfall, respectively. Temperature has an overall positive effect on dengue

705

incidence (median regression line of the rate of change is positive), but can also

706

have large negative and positive effects (a, b). Rainfall has an overall negative effect

707

(median regression line of the rate of change is negative), but can also have small

708

positive effects (a, c). Some of this effect variation can be explained by the

709

susceptible population size (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Temperature and rainfall effects on dengue vary depending on the

712

susceptible population size. Effects of climate drivers (i.e., temperature and

713

rainfall) are investigated in relation to the proxy for susceptible population size, 𝜆&.

714

Plotting the effect of changes in temperature (a) and rainfall (b) against the

715

susceptible population size shows that driver effects are split around the threshold

716

of 𝜆& = 0.85 (purple dashed line). The red and blue lines represent the median

regression of temperature and rainfall effects, respectively (a–f). The dashed red

and blue lines represent the 0.5 and 0.95 quantile regressions of temperature and

719

rainfall effects, respectively (a–f). Neither driver has an effect when there is not a

720

sufficiently large susceptible population size (𝜆& < 0.85) for an outbreak (c, e).

721

However, above a certain susceptible population size the climate effects are

722

observed: temperature with mostly a (possibly sigmoidal, see Figure S9) positive

723

effect (d) and rainfall with a negative effect (f). However, even when driver effects

724

are split at the evident threshold of 𝜆& = 0.85 (c–f), there are still many occurrences

725

when the susceptible population size is sufficient large (𝜆& > 0.85) but temperature

726

and rainfall have no effect. In certain cases, temperature has even a negative effect

727

on dengue (d).
