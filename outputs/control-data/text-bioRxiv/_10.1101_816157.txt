Abstract

20

The births of more than 8 million infants have been enabled globally through assisted

21

reproductive technologies (ARTs), including conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) and

22

intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with either fresh embryo transfer (ET) or frozen embryo

23

transfer (FET). However, the potential for elevated risks of ART-related disorders persists in adult

24

life, and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms are largely uncharacterized. Here, we recruited 100

25

nuclear families and profiled the DNA methylomes, genome-wide histone modifications and

26

transcriptomes to clarify the inherent extra risks attributable to specific ART procedures. We

27

discovered that IVF-ET seemed to introduce less disturbance into the infant epigenome than IVF-

28

FET or ICSI-ET did. Furthermore, we noted approximately half of the DNA methylomic changes

29

in ART-conceived offspring could be explained by parental background biases. Through removal

30

of the parental effect, we confirmed that ART per se would introduce minor DNA methylation

31

changes locally. More importantly, we found that ART-induced epigenomic alterations were highly

32

enriched in the processes which might contribute to increased incidence of preeclampsia during

33

pregnancy and metabolic syndrome in offspring. Overall, our study provides an epigenetic basis

34

for the potential long-term health risks in ART-conceived offspring that reinforces the need to

35

review all methods of human ART.

Introduction

37

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has become routine in infertile treatment; indeed,

38

more than eight million ART-conceived infants have been born worldwide1. However,

39

conventional in vitro fertilization and fresh embryo transfer (IVF-ET) will introduce extraordinary

40

changes in the environment where oocytes mature and the early embryo develops2. Moreover,

41

intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), which was initially used to address severe male infertility,

42

has replaced IVF as the most commonly used method for ART-mediated fertilization in many

43

countries3. This more invasive fertilization procedure introduces additional mechanical damage,

44

bypasses the complicated process of sperm-egg recognition and alters a series of downstream

45

reactions4. Embryo cryopreservation enables embryos to be preserved for further transplantation,

46

but both cryogens and freeze-thawing operation may cause damage to embryos5. All those

47

unfavorable factors have raised concerns regarding the long-term health of ART-conceived

48

children in recent years6. Despite claims to the contrary7-9, accumulating evidences have linked

49

ART with potentially increased risks of neurodevelopmental disorders, cardiovascular dysfunction

50

and metabolic abnormity in offspring and preeclampsia during pregnancy10,11.

51

Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, play key roles

52

in regulating gene expression and are relatively sensitive to environmental factors12.

53

Preimplantation embryos undergo dramatic genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming13,14 that

54

coincides with the time frame of ART treatments. Thus, ART-associated perturbations may disturb

55

the establishment and maintenance of epigenomic patterns and increase the relevant health risks

56

of ART-conceived children in later life15. Notwithstanding, published researches on the association

57

between ART and DNA methylation in offspring are limited to either specific genes16,17 or repeated

58

sequences18 and restricted by methods19-23. Meanwhile, few studies have parsed the parental

59

inheritance bias where considerable reports have revealed that parental genetic backgrounds,

60

health situations, nutritional conditions and living habits have potential impacts on the epigenomes

61

of neonates24,25. In addition, genome-wide changes in histone modifications of ART-conceived

62

infants have not been reported and the effects of each specific ART procedure have not been fully

63

elucidated so far.

64

Here, we integrated genome-wide maps of DNA methylation, four histone modifications

65

associated with promoter/enhancer function (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3),

66

and gene expression for nuclear families to investigate the specific multilayer effects of various

67

ART procedures on epigenomes in offspring. We found that various ART treatment would not

68

dramatically disturb the global epigenome of neonates but subtly induced local and functional

69

changes. Our comprehensive analysis not only accords with the findings in previous epidemiology

70

studies but also reveals unexplored healthy risks in offspring from epigenomic aspect, and may

71

serve as a valuable resource for researchers on the epigenetic influences of ART procedures.

Results

74

Global epigenomic profiles in ART-conceived neonates

75

To systematically study the DNA methylomic effects of different types of ARTs on offspring,

76

we performed reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) on 137 umbilical cord blood

77

(UCB) samples and 158 parental peripheral blood (PPB) samples from nuclear families with either

78

singletons or twins (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figure. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). The samples

79

were classified into five groups based on the mode of conception: spontaneous (CTRL), IVF-ET,

80

IVF-FET, ICSI-ET and ICSI-FET. There were no significant differences in the clinical features of

81

the neonates among the different groups; in addition, maternal ages were under 35 years old and

82

parental body mass index (BMI) values were comparable in general (Supplementary Table 2). In

83

addition, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on 33 UCB

84

samples to examine histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) and

85

mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) on 32 UCB samples to examine the transcriptomes of neonates

86

(Fig. 1a; Supplementary Figure. 1a and Supplementary Table 1).

87

The results showed that the global DNA methylation levels, histone modifications, and

88

transcriptomes of individual neonates were overall similar among the CTRL and four ART groups

89

(Supplementary Figure. 1b-d). There were also no noticeable differences in global DNA

90

methylation on various functional genomic regions, such as promoters, enhancers and repeats

91

(Supplementary Figure. 1e). Unsupervised clustering of each layer of the reference epigenome

92

showed no obvious subgroups but rather showed broadly distributed patterns among neonates,

93

except for H3K4me3 in the IVF-FET and ICSI-ET groups (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figure. 2a).

94

These observations were further verified in hierarchical clustering analyses of the CTRL group

95

versus specific ART subtype groups or ARTs as a whole; the accuracies in these analyses were

96

close to a completely random value (50%) for binary classification but were markedly higher with

97

regard to H3K4me3 in the IVF-FET and ICSI-ET groups (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figure. 2b-

98

h). These results suggested that ART processes do not dramatically disturb the overall epigenomes

and transcriptomes of neonates in general but that H3K4me3 might be exceptionally sensitive to
disturbance by specific ART procedures.

101

Correlation analysis for the DNA methylomes of twin pairs showed an overall high

102

correlation coefficient greater than 0.99 (Fig. 1d); the coefficient for monozygotic twins was

103

significantly higher than that for dizygotic twins in the CTRL group, consistent with previous

104

studies26,27. The relatively lower correlation coefficients in all four ART subgroups than in the

105

CTRL group implied that ART processes might subtly affect the epigenomes of neonates (Fig. 1d).

106

Additionally, this phenomenon could also be observed when only same-sex twins were analyzed

107

or in any two non-twin-pair neonates in each group (with exclusion of twin-pair bias)

108

(Supplementary Figure. 3a-c). Moreover, the standard deviations of the DNA methylation levels

109

of all neonates in the different ART groups were slightly but significantly higher than that in the

110

CTRL group (Fig. 1e). Above results indicated that ART itself might increase heterogeneity in

111

neonates. Intergroup correlation analysis revealed that the IVF-ET group was the most similar to

112

the CTRL group with regard to H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, transcriptomes and DNA

113

methylomes genome-wide or on special elements (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Figure. 3d),

114

indicating that IVF-ET might have less epigenetic influence on neonates than the other three ART

115

processes. These findings suggested that imperceptible disturbances might be introduced into

116

neonates and might vary among different ART subtypes.

120

between groups for DNA methylation, histone modifications, and gene expression. In particular,

121

to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs), six comparisons were generated using all

122

neonates, only singleton neonates, and four groups of neonates from twin cohorts. DMRs in at

123

least four comparisons were selected for downstream analysis to improve the confidence of the

124

analysis (Supplementary Figure. 3e, see Methods for more details). The numbers of hyper-/hypo-

125

DMRs, gain/loss differential histone modifications (differential peaks, DPs), and up-

126

/downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the different comparison groups are

127

shown in Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 4 (see Supplementary Table 5-10 for more details). The

128

difference detected in DMRs was mainly less than 15%, which was relatively moderate

129

(Supplementary Figure. 4a). Meanwhile, only a few DPs were observed in the comparison between

130

the IVF-ET and CTRL groups for four histone modifications, suggesting that IVF-ET has little

131

impact on histone modification (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 4). The numbers of H3K4me3

132

DPs detected in the comparison between the ICSI-ET/IVF-FET and CTRL groups (ICSI-ET: 8352

133

gain, 205 loss; IVF-FET: 5526 gain, 210 loss) were consistent with the observation in unsupervised

134

clustering (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figure. 2a, f-g), while the majority of the increased DPs in

135

the ICSI-ET/IVF-FET groups were in regions with originally weak signals in the CTRL and IVF-

136

ET groups (Supplementary Figure. 4b). All of the DEGs, DMRs and DPs for each ART group

137

versus the CTRL group were further validated at the individual level and broadly distributed on

138

the genome scale (Supplementary Figure. 4c-e; Supplementary Figure. 5). Together, these results

139

indicated that ART processes potentially caused subtle epigenetic changes distributed widely

140

throughout the genome.

142

Parent-derived and ART-derived DNA methylomic differences in offspring

143

To evaluate parental influence on the DNA methylomes of progeny, the DNA methylation

144

levels of DMRs identified in neonates were further analyzed in parents. There were significant

145

differences between the two groups of fathers or mothers (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Figure. 6a;

146

p<0.01). In addition, approximately 50% of DMRs identified in neonates significantly overlapped

147

with DMRs identified in their corresponding parents (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figure. 6b,

148

Supplementary Table 14). To investigate the effects of ARTs per se, the overlapping DMRs were

149

removed and the remaining neonatal DMRs were used as the final neonatal DMRs for downstream

150

analysis (Supplementary Figure. 6c, Supplementary Table 11 and 15). As expected, no significant

151

differences were observed in the DNA methylation levels of the final neonatal DMRs between the

152

corresponding parental groups (Supplementary Figure. 6d-e).

153
154

Epigenomic alteration of regulatory regions in IVF-ET-conceived offspring

155

IVF-ET, the most basic process of ART treatment, is generally recommended as a first-line

156

ART therapy for couples with female infertility28. A total of 1703 hyper-DMRs and 2658 hypo-

157

DMRs were identified in the IVF-ET group compared with the CTRL group (Supplementary Table

158

11). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the associated genes of DMRs were

159

enriched in a broad range of processes, including processes related to the nervous system,

160

respiratory system and cardiovascular system, etc. (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table 16). Human

161

Phenotype Ontology (HPO) analysis also indicated that alterations in DNA methylome induced by

162

IVF-ET might lead to abnormal phenotypes in ocular, cardiovascular and skeletal system, tooth

163

morphology and metabolism, etc. (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Table 16).

164

Given the distinct roles of various genomic regions in regulating gene expression, we

165

performed ChromHMM using four types of histone modifications and identify 12 chromatin states

166

to investigate the specific impacts of IVF-ET on the DNA methylation of functional elements (Fig.

167

3c). The regions covered in our DNA methylation data were mainly the regions related with

168

transcription start site (TSS) (E7 and E8), consistent with the features of highly enriched CpG

169

regions in RRBS. Notably, a large fraction of DMRs were concentrated on Active enhancer (E2),

170

Poised enhancers (E4), Active TSS upstream sites (E6) and Bivalent/Poised TSSs (E8), but almost

171

depleted from Active TSSs (E7) (Fig. 3d). GO analysis for those DMRs in different chromatin

172

states suggested that those hyper-DMRs in Weak enhancer (E1), Bivalent/Poised TSSs (E8) and

173

ZNF Genes & Repeats (E9) might be associated with the interference on nervous system, while

174

hyper-DMRs in Repressed Polycomb (E10) might account for the influence on cardiovascular

175

system. Meanwhile, hypo-DMRs in Active TSS upstream (E6) and Weak repressed polycomb (E11)

176

might highly correlated with immune system and skeletal system, respectively (Fig. 3e,

177

Supplementary Table 16). In fact, the intersection of the DMR associated genes with the DEGs

178

revealed that the majority of the DMRs were not associated with transcriptional changes in their

179

associated genes (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Table 17). For DEGs overlapped with hypo-DMRs

180

associated genes, MDGA1 was upregulated in the IVF-ET group, while RGS12 was downregulated;

181

in the former, the DMRs occurred in promoters, while in the latter they occurred in introns. The

182

expression of genes associated with hyper-DMRs in introns or distal intergenic regions, such as

184

Polymorphisms/mutations in MDGA1 and DIP2C are associated with mental disease, and

185

dysregulation of KIAA1671, CCND1, and DIP2C has been reported to take part in tumorigenesis;

186

furthermore, RGS12 dysfunction contributes to tumorigenesis as well as pathological cardiac

187

hypertrophy, osteoclast genesis and bone destruction. Together, our findings indicated that DNA

188

methylomic changes caused by IVF-ET might affect multiple aspects related with neonates’ health,

189

but mainly kept away from active TSS regions.

190
191

Identification of altered epigenomic profiles associated with ICSI procedures

192

To investigate the differences between those two ways of fertilization, we first compared ICSI-

193

ET with IVF-ET and identified more than 4500 DMRs and 9000 H3K4me3 DPs (Supplementary

194

Tables 4 and 11; 2365 hyper-DMRs and 2386 hypo-DMRs; 8914 gain DPs and 270 loss DPs).

195

Although there were no overlapped genomic locations, the changes shared common associated

196

genes and GO terms (Extended Data Figs. 7a-c), with only a few genes showed consistent changes

197

in expression with changes in the epigenome (Supplementary Tables 18). Taking the differences

198

between the ICSI-ET and CTRL groups into account enabled us to determine the abnormal effects

199

of ICSI per se. Thereafter, the DMRs and H3K4me3 DPs of the ICSI-ET group versus the IVF-ET

200

group were refined, the former based on k-means clustering of DNA methylation levels among the

201

ICSI-ET, IVF-ET and CTRL groups and the latter based on integrated comparison between DPs

202

of ICSI-ET vs CTRL (n=8557) and DPs of ICSI-ET vs IVF-ET (n=9184). Six clusters of DMRs

203

(C1~C3 for hyper-DMRs, C4~C6 for hypo-DMRs) and overlapping H3K4me3 DPs (n=7317) that

204

showed similar change tendencies in the comparison of ICSI-ET vs IVF-ET and ICSI-ET vs CTRL

205

groups were selected for downstream analysis (Fig. 4a-b; Extended Data Figs. 7d; Supplementary

206

Tables 19). The associated genes of hyper-DMRs and gain DPs were enriched in processes

207

involving the development of skeletal system and Wnt signaling morphogenesis, respectively (Fig.

208

4c; Supplementary Table 20). Meanwhile, HPO annotation of those DMRs also revealed that the

209

disturbance in those regions might potentially introduce adverse effect on appendage and skeletal

210

system (Extended Data Figs. 7e; Supplementary Table 20). Though there were only 84 loss DPs

211

of H3K4me3, they were highly enriched in GO terms of immune system (Fig. 4c; Supplementary

212

Table 20). Similar to the observation in IVF-ET, the selected DMRs for ICSI also tended to avoid

213

the active TSSs (Fig. 4d). Associated genes of hyper DMRs in ZNF Genes & Repeats (E9) and

214

weak repressed polycomb (E11) were enriched in the processes of immune and nervous system,

215

respectively. Associated genes of hypo-DMRs in Active TSS (E7) and ZNF Genes & Repeats (E9)

216

were also enriched in the processes of immune and nervous system, respectively (Fig. 4e;

217

Supplementary Table 20). As expected, H3K4me3 peaks were mainly enriched in regions around

218

TSSs (E5, E6, E7, E8). However, regions for the selected gain H3K4me3 DPs in CTRL and IVE-

219

ET group were highly enriched in active enhancer (E2) and poised enhancer (E4) and shifted to

220

ZNF Genes & Repeats (E9) in ICSI-ET. For loss H3K4me3 DPs, the situation was reversed (Fig.

221

4d). GO terms for the selected gain H3K4me3 DPs in E2 and E4 were mainly related to the

222

regulation of leukocytes, cell migration/adhesiveness and the development of several systems (Fig.

223

4e; Supplementary Table 20). These results suggested that ICSI might alter H3K4me3 at enhancers

224

and affect multiple processes. Together, the results regarding both the DNA methylome and

225

H3K4me3 modification raise the question of whether ICSI may have a potential impact on health

226

of offspring, with the skeletal systems and immune system as the representatives.

227
228

Specific epigenomic changes induced by freeze-thawing procedure

229

We then investigated the differences between the IVF-FET and IVF-ET groups and observed

230

6251 DMRs and 5683 DPs of H3K4me3 (Supplementary Tables 4 and 11; 4191 hyper-DMRs and

231

2060 hypo-DMRs; 5548 gain DPs and 135 loss DPs). In addition, compared to the number of DPs

232

in the ICSI-ET group versus the IVF-ET group or the CTRL group, the notably increased numbers

233

of H3K4me1, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac DPs suggested that the freeze-thawing procedure might

234

introduce more disturbance of histone modifications than ICSI (Supplementary Figure. 8a;

235

Supplementary Table4). Moreover, the DMRs and DPs (of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) shared

236

common associated genes and GO terms, implying that freeze-thawing procedure might cause

237

certain functional changes through different epigenetic layers (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Figure.

238

8b; Supplementary Table 21~22).

239

To further explore the specific effects of freeze-thawing procedure per se, we selected six

240

subgroups of DMRs of IVF-FET vs IVF-ET through k-means clustering of scaled DNA

241

methylation levels among the IVF-FET, IVF-ET and CTRL groups (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Table

242

23; cluster C11~13 in hyper-DMRs and cluster C14~C16 in hypo-DMRs), as well as H3K4me3

243

DPs (n=4999) identified by intersection in the comparison of IVF-FET vs IVF-ET (n=5683) and

244

IVF-FET vs CTRL (n=5736) (Fig. 5c). The replications of DMRs and DPs for each group were

245

highly comparable (Supplementary Figure. 8c). The associated genes of selected hyper-DMRs

246

were highly enriched in the processes of neutrophil-mediated immunity and the regulation of

247

GTPase/Ras (Fig. 5d). The results of HPO analysis further revealed that the selected DMRs might

248

be related to carcinogenesis (Supplementary Figure. 8d; Supplementary Table 22). The majority

249

of selected hyper/hypo-DMRs were inclined to evade from Active TSS (Fig. 5e), and the

250

associated genes of those DMRs in Active enhancer (E2) and Active TSS upstream (E6) were

251

highly enriched in the processes of immune system, metabolism of purine/carbohydrate, muscle

252

and skeletal system (Fig. 5f; Supplementary Table 22). Poised enhancer (E4) was the most

253

overrepresented states for the selected gain H3K4me3 DPs in CTRL/IVF-ET group and became

254

ZNF Genes & Repeats (E9) in IVF-FET. Associated genes for the selected gain H3K4me3 DPs in

255

E2 and E4 were enriched in the processes of certain systems (Fig. 5e-f; Supplementary Table 22).

256

It was also worth mentioning that the genes PGP, PLOD3, and STAB1 in the IVF-FET group all

257

exhibited decreased expression with hyper-DMRs in their promoters. In addition, the expression

258

level of SEPT9 also showed decreased tendency in the IVF-FET group, with hyper-DMRs detected

259

in the TSS upstream region and hypo-DMRs detected in the TSS downstream region

260

(Supplementary Table 21). Considering that the dysregulation of the PGP, PLOD3, STAB1 and

261

SEPT9 genes as well as the GTPase signaling pathway is potentially associated with

262

carcinogenesis29, the above results implied that disturbance in the epigenome introduced by

263

cryopreservation per se might potentially affect the immune system and increase the risk of cancer

264

later in life.

267

Since various ART processes share common procedures, we further analyzed the relationship

268

among DMRs/DPs to investigate the common epigenetic effects of ART treatments. Clearly, the

269

DMRs identified in seven pairwise comparisons were overlapped significantly in genomic location

270

and shared many common GO terms (Supplementary Figure. 9a-b; Supplementary Table 24).

271

Moreover, a considerable number of DMRs showed similar change tendencies in different ART

272

groups compared with CTRL group through k-means clustering using DMRs from all seven groups

273

(Fig. 6a; Supplementary Table 25; C22, n=931; C23, n=776). The associated genes of C22 and

274

C23 were highly enriched in the regulation of GTPase activity, stress-activated MAPK cascade,

275

cell morphogenesis and neuron projection development in GO analysis (Fig. 6b; Supplementary

276

Table 24).

277

Interestingly, clusters C21 and C24 seemed to represent regions where ICSI and freeze-

278

thawing procedure might introduce similar alterations, revealed by the similar change on DNA

279

methylation levels in the ICSI-ET and IVF-FET groups compared with CTRL and IVF-ET groups

280

(Fig. 6a, Supplementary Table 25). These DMRs were related to Wnt signaling pathway,

281

respiratory, cardiovascular and nervous system. Similarly, there were noticeable overlaps between

282

ICSI- and freeze-thawing-specific gain H3K4me3 DPs (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Table 25; C1-C3

283

and C11-C13; n=3553), which were mainly involved in immune (B lymphocytopenia,

284

Abnormality of B cell number, Neutropenia) and skeletal system by HPO analysis (Supplementary

285

Figure. 9c; Supplementary Table 24). As mentioned previously, those DMRs were also noticeably

286

absent from Active TSS (E7), with the increased enrichment in ZNF Genes & Repeats (E9) for

287

DMRs in clusters C21 and C24 (Fig. 6d). Meanwhile, the difference between ICSI-FET and IVF14

288

ET would be expected as a mixed effect of ICSI and freeze-thawing operation, indeed, large

289

percentage of those DMRs showed similar changes in ICSI-ET or IVF-FET (C31~C33; C35, C36,

290

C38). However, 13% hyper-DMRs (C34) and 19% hypo-DMRs (C37) were uniquely found in

291

ICSI-FET groups, implying complex interactions between ICSI and freeze-thawing

292

(Supplementary Figure. 9d, Supplementary Table 25). The above results together suggested that

293

in addition to causing their own unique effects, as mentioned previously, distinct ART procedures

294

also leaded to certain common effects on the epigenomes of offspring.

295
296

Discussion

297

Safety concerns regarding ARTs are as old as ARTs themselves30. Although a number of

298

studies suggest that ART may have adverse effects on the long-term health on offspring, the

299

underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We systematically explored the influences of

300

fertilization procedures and freeze-thawing operation on descendant genome-wide DNA

301

methylation, histone modifications and gene expression. Recruitment of nuclear families with

302

twins provided us with perfect biological replicates in each family and enabled us to eliminate

303

ART-irrelevant parental impacts as much as possible. Our study illustrates that the epigenomes of

304

neonates conceived by ART are overall similar to those of naturally conceived children, which

305

may partially explain why most ART offspring are generally healthy. However, ART do increase

306

the heterogeneity of the DNA methylome within twin pairs and induce local subtle changes in

307

different epigenetic layers, supporting the theory that ART increases risks of epigenomic

308

abnormality16-18. We also found that more than half of the DNA methylomic changes in ART

309

offspring were derived from parents, highlighting the necessity of removing parental bias in

310

assessing the influences of ARTs per se. Moreover, we reported the genome-wide impacts of

311

ARTs on four types of histone modifications in humans for the first time. The epigenomes of

312

IVF-ET conceived infants seemed to be closer to those of naturally conceived infants than those

313

of IVF-FET or ICSI-ET conceived infants and showed almost no disturbance in either type of

314

histone modification, suggesting that ART-inherent procedures, including controlled ovarian

315

hyperstimulation (COH), in vitro culture, in vitro fertilization, etc., may not increase the risks of

316

abnormal histone reprogramming; however, ICSI and freeze-thawing operation may do so. What

317

surprised us was that H3K4me3 was the most profoundly impacted by ICSI and freeze-thawing

318

compared with the other three types of histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K27me3 and

319

H3K27ac), therefore, H3K4me3 might serve as a sensitive histone modification for assessment

320

of the influences of ARTs.

321

The distributions of epigenetic changes tended to be away from active cis-regulatory elements

322

and were not largely associated with transcriptional changes in corresponding genes. Functional

323

enrichment of epigenetic changes suggested that epigenetic disorders caused by ICSI might

324

interfere the processes associated with skeletal system, which is also highlighted in a recent study

325

about the potential impact of ART on DNA methylome31. Our results also indicated that freeze-

326

thawing procedure, as well as ICSI, might increase the risks of immune dysfunction in offspring.

327

Though the risks of hospital admission in FET-conceived children and asthma medication in ART-

328

conceived children have been reported to be higher than CTRL conceived children32,33, direct

329

evidence regarding the effects of ART on the immune system is lacking so far and long-term

330

follow-up studies are required. Previous studies have revealed elevated rates of preeclampsia in

331

women who have undergone FET34. GTPases, especially Rho kinases, play essential roles in

332

extravillous trophoblast cell (EVT) invasion35, and limited EVT invasion following poor

333

remodeling of arteries is widely observed in preeclampsia36. More interestingly, our results

334

suggested that freeze-thawing operation might cause dysregulation in the GTPase/Ras signaling

335

pathway in offspring. Thus, the epigenetic abnormality we report may also possibly explain the

336

increased risks of preeclampsia in FET compared with fresh ET pregnancies. Our findings

337

emphasize that it is reasonable to inform patients of potential risks associated with ICSI and

338

embryo cryopreservation and that it would be wise to reconsider overutilization of ICSI or routine

339

freezing of all embryos.

340

Apart from the influences for given ART operations, we also revealed the common effects

341

induced by various ART processes. Further analysis showed that ART-induced DNA methylation

342

changes were enriched in the processes of cardiovascular system and glucolipid metabolism in the

343

comparisons of all four ART groups versus CTRL groups. Since the abnormalities in lipid profiles

344

and higher rates of cardiovascular dysfunction have been reported in ART-achieved children11,37,

345

it implies that the disturbance on epigenome by ART in offspring may increase the risk of

346

metabolic syndrome38. In addition, we identified a considerable number of common DMRs among

347

different ART groups compared with CTRL group. It is noteworthy that the regulation of GTPase

348

activity was the most overrepresented terms in GO analysis for those DMRs, which is in line with

349

those studies suggesting that pregnancies conceiving by ART is related with the increased risk for

350

certain cancers in offspring and preeclampsia compared with natural pregnancy39,40.The common

351

DMRs induced by both ICSI and freeze-thawing procedure were enriched in the processes

352

involving in neuron, consistent with the concern that these two kinds of aggressive ART operation

353

might increase the risk of mental disorders in offspring41. As suggested by the reports that

354

improved in vitro culture systems for animals will affect the epigenome less than earlier

355

versions42,43, continuous optimization for ART procedures is urgently needed to simulate the in

356

vivo environment and reduce potential epigenetic abnormalities in offspring.

357

Our study was mainly focused on the effects of different fertilization methods and freeze-

358

thawing and only involved newborns after full-term pregnancy, lacking postnatal follow-up data

359

on the enrolled populations. A larger multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) along with

360

detection of the epigenetic profiles of offspring in later life would be helpful for elucidation of

361

continued epigenetic change and exploration of the specific epigenetic impacts of other factors in

362

ART treatment, such as the duration of embryo culture or the composition of the culture system.

363

In conclusion, our results provide an epigenetic basis for the increased long-term health risks

364

in ART offspring. Our study highlights ART clinical interventions that require particular

365

surveillance. More effort should be expended to optimize current ART systems, and the choice of

366

appropriate procedures requires careful evaluation. Since epigenomic changes might be

367

maintained throughout the human lifespan44 and can potentially be transmitted to subsequent

368

generations, long-term follow-up and health evaluation of ART offspring are necessary to provide

369

more robust clinical evidence.

hierarchical clustering for IVF-ET vs CTRL (cyan), ICSI-ET vs CTRL (sienna), IVF-FET vs

501

CTRL (dark cyan), and ICSI-FET vs CTRL (dark sienna) neonatal samples. Samples and genomic

502

regions used were the same as in b. d. Box plots for the distribution of the within-twin-pair Pearson

503

correlation coefficients for genomewide DNA methylation in each group as in b, respectively. Twin

504

pairs in CTRL group were classified into two subgroups, monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Each

505

black dot represents the Pearson correlation coefficient and the cyan dots are the arithmetic means.

506

The p-value between two groups was determined by unpaired and two-tailed t-test. e. Violin-box

507

plots showed the distribution of standard deviations of genomewide DNA methylation for neonatal

508

samples in each group mentioned in b, respectively. The p-value between two groups was

509

determined by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. f. For each layer of the reference epigenome and

510

transcriptome, violin-box plots showing the distribution of Pearson correlation coefficients

511

512

value between two groups was determined by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. g. The number of DMRs,

513

DPs of four histone modifications, and DEGs for neonatal samples were shown for seven

514

comparisons: IVF-ET versus CTRL, ICSI-ET versus CTRL, IVF-FET versus CTRL, ICSI-FET

515

versus CTRL, ICSI-ET versus IVF-ET, IVF-FET versus IVF-ET, and ICSI-FET versus IVF-ET.

Fig. 2, Remove the parental effects in neonatal DMRs.

a. Violin-box plots displayed the

520

distribution of DNA methylation level in paternal samples at hyper- (upper) and hypo-DMRs

521

(lower) of the seven comparisons, IVF-ET versus CTRL, ICSI-ET versus CTRL, IVF-FET versus

522

CTRL, ICSI-FET versus CTRL, ICSI-ET versus IVF-ET, IVF-FET versus IVF-ET, and ICSI-FET

523

versus IVF-ET neonatal samples. The p-value between two groups was determined by Wilcoxon

524

rank-sum test. b. Bar graph showed the proportion of DMRs with/without hereditary effects in the

525

hyper- or hypo-DMRs of each comparison. Any one of the 14 groups of DMRs were classified

526

into four subgroups, without hereditary effects (w/o), only with paternal hereditary effects

527

(w/paternal, only overlapped with the DMRs of comparison for the corresponding fathers), only

528

with maternal hereditary effects (w/ maternal, only overlapped with the DMRs of comparison for

529

the corresponding mothers), and with biparental hereditary effects (w/ biparental, overlapped with

530

the DMRs of comparisons for the corresponding fathers and mothers).
