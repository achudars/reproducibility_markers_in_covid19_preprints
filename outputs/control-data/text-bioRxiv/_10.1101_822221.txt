Abstract
A single oral inoculation to mice of the live attenuated Yersinia pseudotuberculosis VTnF1
strain producing an F1 pseudocapsule protects against bubonic and pneumonic plague.
However oral vaccination can fail in humans exposed to frequent intestinal infections. We
evaluated in mice the efficacy of subcutaneous vaccine injection as an alternative way to
induce protective immunity, while reducing the dose and avoiding strain release in nature. A
single subcutaneous dose of up to 108 CFU induced dose-dependent antibody production. At
the dose of 107 CFU, i.e. 10 times less than via the oral route, it caused a modest skin reaction
and protected 100% against bubonic and 80% against pneumonic plague, caused by high
doses of Yersinia pestis. Bacteria migrating to lymph nodes and spleen, but not feces, were
rapidly eliminated. Thus, subcutaneous injection of VTnF1 would represent a good alternative
when dissemination in nature and human intestinal responsiveness are limitations.
Key words: bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, live vaccine, Yersinia pestis, Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis, subcutaneous

Introduction
Despite efficient antibiotic treatments, plague lethality in endemic regions remains superior
to 10% [1], mainly due to the fast development of pathogenesis. Plague is endemic in more
than 25 countries worldwide (including Madagascar, RDC, USA, China, Peru) and in addition
to permanent foci, plague is reappearing since few decades and is categorized by WHO (World
Health Organization) as a re-emerging disease [1]. No vaccine is widely available. A live
attenuated Y. pestis vaccine is used in Russia and China but requires yearly boosting [2]. Two
candidate recombinant vaccines under development in the USA and China are composed of
F1 and LcrV (V) antigens. They have passed phase II clinical development but are not yet
commercialized [3, 4].
We recently proposed to use a live Y. pseudotuberculosis to vaccinate against plague.
This species originated from the same ancestor as the plague agent and is genetically very
closely related but

much

less

pathogenic.

To

this

aim,

a

genetically defined

Y. pseudotuberculosis strain was strongly attenuated by irreversible deletion of three loci
encoding essential virulence factors (psaA, HPI, and yopK). It was modified to produce the
Y. pestis F1 pseudocapsule by insertion of the Y. pestis caf operon, and named VTnF1. A
single oral dose of VTnF1 generates both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses
against multiple antigens of the bacteria and confers high-level protection against bubonic and
pneumonic forms of plague [5].

VTnF1 was devised for the oral route because Yersiniae are enterobacteria which enter
host gut secondary lymphoid tissues, strongly stimulate the host immune system, thus causing
their own elimination. Although efficient for immunization, there are challenges for
implementation. First, the oral route is not equally efficacious in different populations. Multiple
intestinal infections alter the gut wall and immune system and reduce the efficacy of oral
vaccination [6, 7] and most of the human population at risk for plague (Madagascar, Congo,
Tanzania, etc.) is also exposed to such intestinal infections. Second, the dissemination of a
live organism vaccine in the environment via feces may be considered unacceptable by those
who fear GMOs and consider possible the reversion to more virulence [8, 9].
Vaccination by subcutaneous injection (sc; or hypodermal), intradermal or intramuscular
injection could avoid these difficulties. The skin is an attractive site from an immunologic
perspective: it contains many resident dendritic cells which capture antigens and migrate to
lymph nodes to present antigens and recruit T lymphocytes [10]. Vaccination via skin generally
requires less vaccine as compared to the oral route, in which a large part is eliminated by the
intestinal transit. Bacteria injected sc also should not be disseminated in nature. We here
examined the possibility to subcutaneously vaccinate mice against plague using the VTnF1
live attenuated candidate vaccine.

Materials and methods
Ethics statement
The Institut Pasteur animal facility is accredited by the French Ministry of Agriculture (B
75 15-01, issued on May 22, 2008), in compliance with French and European regulations (EC
Directive 86/609, French Law 2001-486; June 6, 2001). The research protocol was approved
by the French Ministry of Research (N° 2013-0038).

Bacterial strains and culture conditions
The Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis isolates and their growth conditions were
previously described [5, 11]. All experiments involving Y. pestis strains were performed in a
BSL3 laboratory or level 3 animal room.
Animal vaccination and in vivo analyses
Seven-week-old OF1 female mice (Charles River) were housed and manipulated in a
BSL3 animal facility as described previously [11]. Vaccination consisted of subcutaneous (sc)
injection of a VTnF1 suspension (105, 106, 107, or 108 CFU in 50μl saline) in the skin of the
back. Mice were monitored daily for signs of prostration and aspect (ruffled hair) and were

weighed. The skin reaction was scored as follows. 0: no papule; 1: not visible but perceptible by
pinching the skin between fingers (≤ 1mm), 2: visible but small (1-2 mm) between fingers; 3: ³ 2
mm between fingers. To examine in vivo VTnF1 dissemination, groups of mice were euthanized
after predefined times and skin at the injection site (2 cm2), draining lymph nodes, and spleen
were collected aseptically. They were homogenized in sterile PBS using 3 mm glass beads
(soft tissues) or steel beads (skin) and an electric mill (TissueLyser®, Qiagen). Samples were
plated on LB-agar containing Kanamycin and Spectinomycin. The presence of VTnF1 in feces
was tested by plating 2-3 pellets per mouse.
Plague challenge experiments
Mice were challenged four weeks after vaccination with Y. pestis resuspended in saline
after growth at 28°C on LBH plates. Bubonic plague was induced by sc injection in the ventral
skin. For pneumonic plague, it had been reported that too low volumes of bacteria instilled
intranasally mostly stay in the upper respiratory tract [12, 13]. Using bioluminescent Y. pestis
[5], we observed that lung colonization was obtained when 20 µl of bacteria (10 μl per nostril)
were instilled (Supplementary Figure 1). Therefore, mice were infected as previously described
[5], except the volume of 20 μl was used. Survival was followed for 21 days.

Evaluation of the immune response
Mouse blood was collected three weeks after vaccination and serum IgG directed against
F1 or a Y. pestis ∆caf sonicate were measured as previously described [5, 11].
Statistical analyses
The Fisher exact test (for mice survival), the unpaired Mann-Whitney test (for bacteria
numbers, animal weight, and antibody titers) were performed with Prism® (GraphPad).

Results and discussion
The VTnF1 candidate vaccine strain injected subcutaneously is avirulent and induces a
protective immune response
Increasing doses of VTnF1 (105 to 108 CFU tested altogether in 24, 24, 46, and 38 mice
respectively) were injected subcutaneously to OF1 mice in the back. No lethality and no clinical
signs of illness were observed over a 4 weeks post vaccination follow-up, showing that VTnF1,
strongly attenuated via the oral route [5], is also highly attenuated via a parenteral route (sc).
This also indicates that the attenuation affected the bacteria’s ability to survive in the host body,
and not only its capacity to infect the gut.

To evaluate protection against bubonic plague, mice received a single injection of VTnF1
(105 to 108 CFU) and were challenged 4 weeks after by ventral sc injection of Y. pestis (severe
bubonic plague challenge: 10,000xLD50). High-level protection (96-100%) was obtained with
the 107 CFU dose and higher (Table 1). Therefore, protection via the sc route required a dose
at least 10-times lower than via the oral route [5].
The protection induced by sc and ig vaccination against pneumonic plague were
compared using recently modified conditions to induce airways infection modified recently (see
materials and methods). Both routes conferred around 80% protection (Table 1) against
pneumonic plague caused by a high dose of Y. pestis (107 CFU = 3,300 x LD50) and increasing
the sc dose to 108 CFU did not increase protection.
Y. pestis specific IgG were measured in the serum of vaccinated mice. Vaccination
induced a strongly dose-dependent production of IgG directed to either F1 (Fig.1A) or all other
Yersinia antigens (F1- Y. pestis; Fig. 1B). Antibody titers were compared to those of oral
VTnF1. Sc injection induced comparable amounts of IgG against F1, and more IgG against
other Yersinia antigens (F1- Y. pestis; Fig. 1A & B) than ig inoculation. VTnF1 at dose 107
given ig yields heterogenous IgG titers and lower protection (Fig 1 and [14]). Altogether, the
vaccine given sc is as efficient in terms of antibody production (Fig. 1) and protection (Table
1), as when it is given ig at a higher dose. One explanation to the higher IgG response after sc
vaccination may be that bacteria trapped in skin are available to trigger the immune system,
whereas part of bacteria via ig is killed by acidity in the stomach, or fail to bind PP and are
washed away in feces. Similarly, Zhao and co-workers recently reported that the sc route
provided higher protection than the oral route for mice vaccination with a live Salmonella vector
producing Salmonella or Bordetella antigens [15].
A key reason to evaluate the cutaneous route was that the gut immune system of subjects
exposed to repeated oral infections has a reduced ability to respond to immunization, thus
reducing the efficacy of oral vaccines [6, 7]. Such an impairment has so far not been reported
regarding the skin immune system, suggesting that skin vaccination remains a valid
prophylactic approach in these populations.

VTnF1 causes little side effects and disseminates transiently in vivo
Although the subcutaneous route is widely used for live attenuated viruses (Varicella,
measles, mumps [16]), injection of live attenuated bacteria is not usual, possibly due to side
effects with candidate vaccines tested previously [17]. Because VTnF1 is highly attenuated
and is efficient at the dose of 107 CFU, we characterized side-effects at that dose. After
injection, half of mice had ruffled fur at day 2, and most had recovered at day 5. Skin papules
at the site of injection were always palpable (Fig. 2A), but were generally not visible by eye,

except in 10% of mice who exhibited a local hair loss, which always regrew to normal
afterwards. A reduction of weight acquisition was observed at day 3, but growth rapidly normalized
later on (Fig. 2B). Because humans are more sensitive to LPS than mice, a reaction of human
tissues to LPS contained in the vaccine may happen, and this will carefully be examined in
future developments. LPS detoxification by deletion of msbB or htrB genes controlling lipid-A
acylation could be considered, as previously reported in Shigella [18].
VTnF1 dissemination from the skin to the draining lymph nodes (LN) and the spleen was
examined (Fig. 3). Bacteria persisted at the skin entry site up to day 5 and then declined, so
that most mice were negative after 3 weeks. At day 1-2, VTnF1 was observed in spleen and
draining lymph nodes, suggesting a simultaneous migration to spleen via blood and to lymph
nodes via lymphatics. VTnF1 loads peaked in all sites at day 5, prior to a progressive
disappearance in LN and spleen after day 9. This transient persistence was therefore
comparable, in its evolution and levels, to that observed after oral vaccination with the higher
dose, in good agreement with the comparable immunization.
The subcutaneous tissue in which the bacteria were injected, also named hypodermis, is
a well vascularized layer of adipose tissue and the most used skin layer for delivery of live
attenuated virus vaccines. Although it is less drained by lymphatics than the actively surveyed
dermis layer, injected particles succeed to reach LN via lymph to trigger adaptive immunity
[19]. Because VTnF1 rapidly reached both LN and spleen (day 1), it must have gained access
to both blood and lymphatic vessels, and this may result from a mechanical damage caused
by injection. Alternatively, antigens could also be carried to LN by specialized antigen
presenting cells. Because the hypodermis is naturally devoid of resident immune cells, these
would be recruited from dermis or blood.
The risk of bacteria passage in the environment was evaluated by searching for VTnF1 in
feces. Feces were analyzed regularly up to one month post inoculation, and no VTnF1 was
detected (Fig. 3). Although it seems trivial that skin is not directly connected to the intestine,
the transit of bacteria via blood could have redirected it to unexpected organs, as was observed
for Listeria monocytogenes moving from blood to the intestine [20]. The absence of vaccine in
feces demonstrates that it did not reach the gut lumen, and that fecal dissemination of this
GMO in nature is very unlikely. For future use, we are re-constructing the VTnF1 strain without
any antibiotics-resistance cassettes (unpublished data), and this will increase safety for both
vaccinated subjects and in case of accidental release.
In conclusion, we have shown that subcutaneous vaccination with the recombinant
attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis vaccine strain VTNF1 efficiently immunized and protected
mice against bubonic and pneumonic plague, with an optimal dose lower than required for oral
vaccination. Because it also avoids dissemination of the vaccine in nature, the hypodermal

as often observed in developing countries.
