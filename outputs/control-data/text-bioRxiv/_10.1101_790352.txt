ABSTRACT
Zinc is a trace element that is essential for a large number of biological and biochemical
processes in the body. In the nervous system zinc is packaged into synaptic vesicles by the ZnT3
transporter, and synaptic release of zinc can influence the activity of postsynaptic cells, either
directly though its own cognate receptors, or indirectly by modulating activation of receptors for
other neurotransmitters. Here, we explore the anatomical and functional aspects of zinc in the
circadian system. Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells in the mouse retina were found to
colocalize ZnT3, indicating that they can release zinc at their synaptic targets. While the master
circadian clock in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) was found to contain, at best,
sparse zincergic input, the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) was found to have prominent zincergic
input. Levels of zinc in these areas were not affected by time of day. Additionally, IGL zinc
staining persisted following enucleation, indicating other prominent sources of zinc instead of, or
in addition to, the retina. Neither enhancement nor chelation of free zinc at either the SCN or
IGL altered circadian responses to phase-shifting light in hamsters. Finally, entrainment, freerunning, and circadian responses to light were explored in mice lacking the ZnT3 gene. In every
aspect explored, the ZnT3-KO mice were not significantly different from their wildtype
counterparts. These findings highlight the presence of zinc in areas critical for circadian
functioning but have yet to identify a role for zinc in these areas.

INTRODUCTION
Daily rhythms in physiology and behavior are regulated in mammals by the master
circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN;Antle and Silver, 2005). This clock
receives input from the retina so that the rhythms it generates are coordinated with the light/dark
cycle of the environment (Rusak and Zucker, 1979). Specialized intrinsically photosensitive
retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that use the photopigment melanopsin provide information about
environmental light to the circadian system (Berson et al., 2002;Hattar et al., 2002;Moore et al.,
1995;Provencio et al., 2000). Axons from these ipRGCs give rise to the retinohypothalamic tract
that innervates the ventrolateral region of the SCN, and uses glutamate as its primary
neurotransmitter (Ebling, 1996). The circadian clock also receives input from other brain
regions, and these inputs can modulate how the circadian clock responds to light and glutamate.
Serotonin from the raphe nuclei attenuates responses to light and glutamate (Antle et al.,
2003;Mistlberger and Antle, 1998;Rea et al., 1994). The retinorecipient intergeniculate leaflet
(IGL) provides NPY-ergic innervation to the SCN that also opposes circadian responses to light
(Biello et al., 1997). Identifying other such modulatory substances could help in treating sleep
and circadian disorders. One such candidate is the divalent cation zinc.
The signaling pool of zinc is found in the brain, stored in vesicles of glutamatergic
neurons in the cortex, amygdala and hippocampus (Brown and Dyck, 2004) from which it is
released and can act as a co-transmitter and neuromodulator at post-synaptic terminals. Zinc is
packaged into vesicles exclusively through the ZnT3 transporter (slc30a3;Cole et al.,
1999;McAllister and Dyck, 2017;Nakashima and Dyck, 2009;Palmiter et al., 1996). Vesicular
zinc inhibits activation of NMDA receptors that contain the GluN2A subunit (Paoletti et al.,
1997;Paoletti et al., 2009), while it facilitates activation of non-NMDA receptors (reviewed in

McAllister and Dyck, 2017;Ugarte and Osborne, 2001). GABAA receptors are also modulated by
zinc (Huang et al., 1993;Kawahara et al., 1993;Strecker et al., 1999). Zinc has also been shown
to be the primary endogenous ligand for GPR39, a metabotropic receptor expressed in the brain
that signals through the Gq-PLC-IP3 pathway (Besser et al., 2009).
The possibility that zinc can modulate circadian rhythms is suggested by its presence in
the ganglion cell layer of the retina (Redenti and Chappell, 2004). Zinc has been histochemically
located in the ventrolateral portion of the rat SCN (Huang, et al., 1993). In dissociated SCN
neurons, zinc enhances the potassium IA current (Huang, et al., 1993), inhibits GABAA currents
(Kawahara, et al., 1993;Strecker, et al., 1999), and inhibits NMDA GluNR2A currents (Clark
and Kofuji, 2010). These in vitro findings suggest that zinc could modulate circadian responses.
To explore this possibility more fully, we devised a series of anatomical and behavioral studies
to determine if vesicular zinc might modulate circadian rhythms. Using hamsters and mice, we
explore the localization of vesicular zinc and its transporter ZnT3 in the retina and circadian
network. We explore the effects that chelating or enhancing zinc levels in the SCN and IGL has
on circadian responses to light. Finally, we explore the circadian properties of the ZnT3knockout (KO) mouse.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and housing
Male C57BL/6J wildtype adult mice (n=4) from an in-house colony were used for retinal
ZnT3 and melanopsin immunohistochemistry. Syrian hamsters (n=40) obtained from Charles
River Laboratories (Kingston, NY, USA) were used for sodium selenite injections and the
vesicular zinc staining, enucleation, and photic entrainment experiments (detailed below). ZnT3-

KO mice (n=9; B6;129-Slc30a3tm1Rpa) and wildtype littermate controls (n=9) were bred from
heterozygous animals from an in-house colony founded by animals received from Dr. Richard
Palmiter, University of Washington. ZnT3-KO mice were genotyped using the protocol for this
strain provided by The Jackson Laboratory (https://www.jax.org/strain/005064) as previously
described (Cole et al., 1999;Nakashima et al., 2011).
Animals were initially housed in pairs in a temperature and humidity-controlled room
with either a 14:10 (hamsters) or 12:12 (mice) light-dark cycle (LD; approximately 1500 lux
during the light phase) and provided with food and water ad libitum. Animals used in
behavioural experiments were transferred to individual polycarbonate cages equipped with a
running wheel. Periodic cage changes took place seven days prior and following manipulation
days. The wheel running activity of the animals was recorded by means of a magnetic switch
fastened to each wheel and monitored using Clocklab (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL). All
experiments adhered to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and were
approved by the Life and Environmental Sciences Animal Care Committee at the University of
Calgary.
Surgery
Some hamsters were surgically implanted with cannulas aimed at the SCN (unilateral,
n=12) or the IGL (bilateral, n=14). Each animal received a subcutaneous injection of the
analgesic butorphanol (2 mg/kg; Wyeth, Madison, NJ, USA) and an i.p. injection of the
anesthetic sodium pentobarbital (90 mg/kg; CEVA). While under anesthesia, hamsters were
stereotaxically implanted with either one (SCN) or two (IGL) 9 mm 22-gauge stainless steel
cannulae (Plastics One Inc., Roanoke, VA, USA). The cannulae were cemented to the skull using
dental acrylic and jeweler’s screws. Coordinates for the SCN were 0.0 mm anterior to bregma,

0.3 mm lateral to the midline, 7.0 mm ventral to the skull surface, and coordinates for the IGL
were 1.9 mm posterior to bregma and 3.3 mm lateral to the midline. To determine depth, two
targets were calculated at 3.3 mm and 4.8 mm below dura and the skull, respectively. The
average of the two target values was taken as the dorsoventral coordinate. The incisor bar was set
to 2 mm below the interaural level for all surgeries. A dummy cannula was inserted to maintain
patency.
Brains were collected for histology at the end of the experiment using the perfusion
method described above. Brain sections were stained using cresyl violet and coverslipped in
Permount. Animals were excluded if the tip of the cannula was more than 600μm away from the
margin of the SCN, or if the tip of either one of the two cannulae was more than 600 μm away
from the margin of either IGL.
Some hamsters received bilateral enucleations. Hamsters were anesthetized with sodium
pentobarbital (100-120 mg/kg) and provided with butorphanol as a pre-operative analgesic and
given a subcutaneous injection of 0.5% bupivacaine into the area immediately around eye. When
unconscious, the eye was gently dissected, and the optic nerve severed. Post-operative analgesic
(butorphanol) was administered as needed.
Histology
Autometallographic Zinc Staining
The autometallographic zinc staining procedure was adapted from the technique
previously employed by (Danscher, 1982). Hamsters received an i.p. injection of 15mg/kg of
sodium selenite dissolved in molecular grade water in DD conditions with the aid of night vision
goggles (BG15Alista, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada) at either ZT6 or ZT18. One hour later,
animals were euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (250mg/kg Euthanyl). For

experiments where the tissue was only being processed for autometallographic zinc staining,
brains were rapidly extracted and immediately frozen on dry ice. If alternate sections were being
processed using immunohistochemistry, animals were perfused transcardially with ~50ml of cold
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 50ml of cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.
Frozen brain sections (35 µm) were collected through the SCN and IGL with a cryostat and were
mounted directly onto gelatin-coated microscope slides.
The tissue was allowed to thaw at room temperature and was then rehydrated in an
alcohol series (95% EtOH for 15 min, 70% for 2 min, 50% for 2 min, 3x2 min in dH2O). Slides
were then dipped in gelatin and transferred to a silver lactate solution for physical development.
The developer solution was prepared by mixing the following solutions in order: 50% gum
arabic from African Acacia trees (100 g in 200 ml dH2O), citrate buffer (5.1g citric acid, 4.7 g
sodium citrate, 20 ml dH2O), silver lactate (0.22g in 30 ml dH2O), and hydroquinone (1.7g in 20
ml dH2O). Slides were developed for 120-150 min in the dark and were checked every 10-15
min, starting at 100 min. Slides were removed from the developer solution after the tissue had
obtained a dark brown uniform stain. The slides were then gently washed under slowly running
tap water at 37°C for 10 min and then in dH2O (2x3 min). Slides were then exposed to 5%
sodium thiosulfate in dH2O for 12 min and washed in dH2O (2x2 min). Sections underwent a
final alcohol dehydration series, were cleared with xylene and coverslipped with Permount.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry protocols were adapted from those previously used in our lab
(Smith et al., 2010). Animals received an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Euthanyl,
250mg/kg) and were then transcardially perfused with cold PBS followed by cold 4% PFA in
PBS. Depending on the experiment, brains or eyes were extracted and were post-fixed overnight

at 4°C in 4% PFA followed by 24h in 20% sucrose in PBS. Frozen sagittal sections (20µm for
eyes, 35µm for brains) were collected with a cryostat and were mounted on gelatin-coated slides
(eyes) or were collected into PBS baths (brains). The general immunohistochemistry procedure
involved three 10 min washes in 0.3% PBS with Triton-X-100 (PBSx), followed by a 60-min
incubation in blocking buffer (10% normal donkey serum for immunofluorescence, 10% normal
goat serum for diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining). Following this, the tissue was incubated in
the primary antibodies for 48h at 4°C. Tissue was then rinsed again (six 10-min washes) before
being incubated in the secondary antibodies. For tissue to be stained with DAB, the tissue was
then incubated in an avidin-biotin complex bath (Vectastain elite, Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). The tissue was then developed for approximately 5 min with 0.05 % DAB and
0.02 % NiCl in 0.1 M Tris buffer activated with 80 μL of 30 % H2O2. Brain slices were
dehydrated through an alcohol series, cleared with xylenes and coverslipped with Permount
(Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, USA) for DAB tissue, or with Krystalon for immunofluorescent
tissue.
Retinal immunohistochemistry included a 20 min wash in 4% PFA prior to initiation of
the protocol detailed above. Primary antibodies used were for melanopsin (anti-rabbit 1:5000,
Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA, USA) and ZnT3 (anti-mouse 1:800, Synaptic
Systems, Goettingren, Germany). Secondary antibodies were CY-3 donkey anti-rabbit and CY-2
donkey anti-mouse (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. West Grove, PA, USA).
Neuropeptide Y immunohistochemistry included a 30 min incubation in 0.5% H2O2 prior
to initiation of the protocol detailed above. The primary antibody was rabbit anti-NPY (1:10,000;
ImmunoStar, Hudson, WI, USA), and a goat-anti rabbit biotinylated secondary was employed
(1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).

Mouse SCN immunohistochemistry used the follow primary antibodies: Fos (goat antiFos; 1:20,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), vasopressin (VP; guinea-pig
anti-VP; 1:5000; Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA, USA), and bombesin/gastrin-releasing
peptide (GRP; rabbit anti-GRP; 1:5000; ImmunoStar Inc., Hudson, WI, USA). The secondary
antibodies used were CY-2 donkey anti-rabbit, CY-3 donkey anti-goat, and CY-5 donkey antiguinea-pig (all 1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, USA).
In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization followed our previously described protocol (Smith et al., 2008).
Briefly, tissue was first treated with proteinase K (1mg/ml, 0.1 M Tris buffer pH 8.0, 50 mM
EDTA; 10 min) at 37ºC. This reaction was terminated with the addition of 4% PFA. Tissue was
rinsed in saline sodium citrate (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate), and then treated with
0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1M triethanolamine for 10 min. The tissue was then incubated in 1.5
ml hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 60 mM sodium citrate, 600 mM NaCl, 10% dextran
sulphate, 1% N-laurylsarcosine, 25 mg/ml tRNA, 1x Denhardt’s, 0.25 mg/ml salmon sperm
DNA) which also contained the DIG-labelled sense and antisense mPer1 (mPer1 plasmid
generously provided by Dr. L. Yan, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA) probes
for 16 h at 60ºC. Following high-stringency post-hybridization washes (50% formamide/saline
sodium citrate at 60ºC, 2x30 min), sections were treated with RNaseA, and then underwent more
high-stringency washes. Tissue was then processed for immunodetection using a nucleic acid
detection kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature in
1.0% of blocking reagent in buffer one (100mM Tris-HCL buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5),
sections were incubated in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated DIG antibodies diluted in buffer
1(1:5000) for 3 days at 4ºC. Sections were then washed in buffer 1 (2x15 min) and incubated in

buffer 3 (100 mM Tris-HCL buffer, pH 9.5, containing 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl2) for 5
min and then incubated in a solution containing nitroblue tetrazolium salt (0.34 mg/ml) and 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate toluidine salt (0.18 mg/ml) for 16 h. The staining reaction
was stopped by placing the sections in buffer 4 (10 mM Tris-HCL containing 1 mM EDTA, pH
8.0). Tissue was then mounted on gelatin coated slides, air dried, dehydrated in an ascending
alcohol series, cleared in xylene, air dried, and coverslipped with Permount.
Image Analysis
All image analysis was performed on an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped for both
brightfield and epifluorescence. Images were captured with a QI CAM Fast 1394 cooled CCD
camera (QImaging, Burnaby, BC, Canada) connected to a computer running Image-Pro Plus
software (Media Cybernetics, Inc. Rockville, MD).
Retinal histology: In total, 120 cells were identified. Colocalization was determined by
initially identifying a melanopsin cell in the retinal ganglion cell layer (on the CY-3 filter
channel) by its characteristic shape and extensive dendritic networks. The presence or absence of
ZnT3 protein was then assessed. The signals were considered colocalized if the ZnT3 signal was
of the same shape, size, and position as the initial melanopsin signal.
Zinc Histology: All images were captured with the same lighting conditions and exposure
time. Densitometric analysis was completed on 16-bit images with the use of ImageJ software
(ImageJ 1.42q; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Zinc staining was quantified for the
SCN by measuring the density of staining in each SCN nucleus and comparing the values to the
density in the optic chiasm. The relative optical density (ROD) was calculated by taking the ratio
of the SCN to optic chiasm density for the dorsolateral, dorsomedial and ventral regions. Density
values were averaged across the SCN nuclei and ROD values were averaged across three

consecutive SCN sections. ROD of IGL sections was determined by taking the ratio of staining
in the IGL to staining in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) for the left and right IGL.
Representative rostral, mid and caudal IGL sections were averaged for the left and right IGL.
Statistical significance was set at p<0.05 for all tests. Separate two-tailed independent samples ttests were conducted to analyze the ROD between the two time points for the dorsomedial,
dorsolateral and ventral SCN, and the left and right IGL.
SCN histology: Tissues triple labelled for cFos, AVP, and GRP were captured. cFosimmunoreactive (-IR) cells were counted bilaterally at the mid-caudal level of the SCN. Cell
counts were obtained in the SCN shell (delineated by AVP-IR cells) and in the SCN core
(delineated by GRP-IR cells). Counts were conducted by two individuals blind to the treatment
conditions. Images of DIG-labelled cells were captured using a RGB colour filter using the
microscope described above. Measurements of ROD of staining were obtained bilaterally at the
mid-caudal level of the SCN using ImageJ (ImageJ 1.34s; National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA). The core and shell were analyzed separately by two individuals blind to
the treatment conditions.
Experiment 1- Confirming ZnT3 localization in ipRGCs
We first explored if the ZnT3 zinc transporter was found in melanopsin-IR ganglion cells
in the mouse retina. Mice (n=4) were euthanized, perfused and their eyes were collected for
double-label fluorescent immunohistochemistry as described above. Mouse tissue was used to
explore this question as these antibodies did not produce specific staining in hamster retinas in
our hands. We identified 120 melanopsin-IR cells. These were determined to be ZnT3-IR if
signal on the ZnT3 channel had the same size, shape and location as the soma on the melanopsin
channel.

Experiment 2- Histochemical zinc staining
Eight male Syrian hamsters were used for visualization of histochemical zinc in the SCN
and IGL. Two weeks prior to the beginning of the experiment, the animals were transferred to
individual cages and kept under the same light-dark cycle. Two days prior to receiving sodium
selenite injections, all animals were moved to constant dark (DD). Zinc terminal staining was
visualized at two specific time points: the middle of the former light period (defined as zeitgeber
time, ZT6) and the middle of the former dark period (ZT18), where lights off in the former LD
cycle is designated ZT12 by convention (n=4 per group).
Experiment 3- Does zinc input to the circadian system come from the retina?
To test the hypothesis that the retina is the source of zinc input to the circadian system,
six male hamsters (controls n=3, n=3 experimental animals) underwent a bilateral enucleation
surgery as described above. As experiment #2 revealed prominent staining in the IGL but only
sparse staining in the SCN, we focused on the IGL in this experiment. A week of recovery was
allowed to provide time for the degeneration of remaining retinal projections. Hamsters then
received an i.p. injection of sodium selenite (15mg/kg). An hour later, animals were euthanized
with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (250mg/kg) and were then perfused transcardially with
~50ml of cold PBS followed by 50ml of cold 4% PFA in PBS. Brains were PFA fixed in this
experiment to allow alternate sections to be stained for NPY to delineate the IGL. Sections were
collected as described above, with one series being processed for zinc as described above. The
alternate series was immunostained for NPY. Relative optical density was used to assess density
of zincergic terminals in the IGL of both control and enucleated hamsters.

To test the effects of manipulating zinc levels on circadian responses to light, male
hamsters underwent cannula implantation surgery (SCN, n=12; IGL, n=14) as described above.
Zinc chloride (ZnCl2; Sigma) dissolved in 0.9% saline to a final concentration of 50μM was used
to increase extracellular zinc (Takeda et al., 2003), while N,N,N′,N′-Tetrakis(2pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN; Sigma) dissolved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to
a final concentration of 5mM was used as a zinc chelator (Cuajungco and Lees, 1996). Vehicle
controls of 0.9% sterile saline and 10% DMSO were included for the zinc donor and chelator,
respectively. Drugs were administered to animals based on a counterbalanced design throughout
the course of the experiment. Due to deterioration of rhythmicity with repeated SCN injections,
only one vehicle control manipulation was performed on each animal (either saline or
10%DMSO). Repeated IGL injections did not lead to the same deterioration of rhythmicity, so
these animals received both vehicle treatments in addition to the ZnCl2 and TPEN treatments.
Intracranial injections of 0.5μL of drugs were administered over a period of 30 seconds during
each manipulation by means of a 26-gauge injection cannula attached to a 1μL Hamilton syringe
with polyethylene 20 tubing. The injection cannula extended 1mm beyond the tip of the
implanted guide cannula. All injections were made in DD conditions with the aid of night-vision
goggles. Ten minutes following drug administration, animals were placed in light boxes and
were exposed to a 15-min 40 lux light pulse in the late subjective night (circadian time (CT18, 6
h after activity onset, which is defined as CT12 by convention). Phase shifts were analyzed with
Clocklab by fitting a regression line to activity onsets for the 10 days prior to the manipulation
and another to onsets on days 3-10 following the manipulation. The horizontal difference
between these lines on the day following the manipulation was used as the phase shift.

All comparisons were made using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc.; San Jose, CA).
Statistical significance was set at p<0.05 for all tests. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA
was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in the photic phase
shifts between the conditions (zinc donor, zinc chelator, vehicle control). For the SCN injections,
animals only received one of the two vehicles (either saline or DMSO). A two-tailed independent
samples t-test was used to compare phase shifts in these vehicle conditions, and they were
merged for the sake of the ANOVA analysis if there was no difference between the vehicle
treatment. For the IGL treatments, animals received both vehicle treatments. A two-tailed paired
t-test was used to compare these shifts, and as they did not significantly differ, the average of
these was used for the ANOVA analysis. All means are reported as ± standard error of the mean
(SEM) in the figures and as ±standard deviation in the text.
Experiment 5- Circadian rhythms changes in the ZnT3 KO model
Circadian Behavior
To explore the consequences of global loss of vesicular zinc on circadian rhythms, we
used mice lacking ZnT3. These mice exhibit a complete lack of vesicular zinc in the brain (Cole,
et al., 1999;McAllister and Dyck, 2017). Mice were initially housed in an LD cycle. After two
weeks in LD, the mice underwent a masking paradigm, whereby for 24 h, the LD cycle was 2:2.
Mice were then returned to LD for two more weeks before being transferred to DD. After two
weeks in DD, the mice were exposed to a dim light pulse (15 min, 40 lux) at either CT16 (early
night) or CT22 (late night). Two weeks later, the mice were exposed to a light pulse again,
however this time undergoing the pulse at the other time. Following this, the same paradigm of
light pulses was repeated; however, in the second round, bright light (~1200 lux) was used. Two

weeks following this manipulation, animals were exposed to a bright light pulse (~1200 lux)
during the subjective day (CT6).
Circadian analysis
Basic features of the circadian rhythms of the ZnT3-KO mice were quantified using mice
running wheel data collected in Clocklab as previously described (Smith et al., 2015). The LD
ratio, a comparison of the running of the mice during the day versus night, was determined.
Mean group waveforms were constructed to examine differences in the duration of the active
period and rest periods in LD and in DD (period and power values using Clocklab’s Chi Square
Periodogram). Period and power of the rhythms were assessed over three blocks in DD (Block
one: DD days 1-10, Block two: DD days 48-57, and Block three: DD days 76-84). The
difference between the onset of the main nocturnal bout of running and the time of lights off,
also known as the phase angle of entrainment (psi), was determined at two points during LD. The
duration of the active phase (alpha) and amount of activity, were calculated for the same two
points during LD, as well as one point during DD. The effect of masking was determined by
compiling the information gathered from the 24 hours the mice spent in the 2:2 LD cycle into 2hour light and dark periods and then calculating a LD ratio. Additionally, LD ratios were
calculated from the masking data by averaging values based on the day and night of the original
12:12 LD cycle. Phase shifts were calculated following exposure to dim (~40 lux) or bright light
(~1250 lux) at CT16 or CT22 and after exposure to bright light at CT6. Phase shifts were
calculated as was described in Experiment 4.
Light induced cFos and mPer1 expression
Two weeks after the completion of the third round of light pulses, cFos and mPer1
expression following a 15-min bright light pulse was assessed at either CT16 or CT22 in both

WT and KO mice (n=3 each genotype and phase). Ninety minutes after exposure to the light
pulse, animals were euthanized, in the dark, via an overdose of sodium pentobarbital, and then
perfused as described above. Gene expression was also assessed for a second group of WT and
KO mice (n=3 each) when administered a bright light pulse at CT22.
Image quantification and statistics
Behavioural data for LD ratios, alpha, and psi were analyzed by comparing measures
obtained for KO mice with that of WTs. Independent samples t-tests were utilized with
significance set at p<0.05. Violations of the assumption of homogeneity of variance were
assessed using Levene’s test. For power and period data, the effect of time was assessed by using
2x3 mixed factorial ANOVA (genotype: WT, KO x time: block 1, 2, and 3) statistical tests.
Phase shifts were analyzed using a 2x2x2 mixed ANOVA (genotype: WT, KO x light: dim,
bright x phase: CT16, CT22) with light and phase being the within-subjects factors and genotype
the between-subjects factor. As only a bright light pulse was used at the CT6 phase, it was
considered in isolation and assessed using an independent samples t-test. In order to compare the
expression of the FOS protein and mPer1 gene in the core versus the shell, 2x2x2 (genotype:
WT, KO x phase: CT16, CT22 x region: core, shell) factorial mixed ANOVAs were conducted.
Region was the within-subjects factor while genotype and phase were the between-subjects
factor. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. All means are reported ± SD in the text and ±
SEM in figures.
RESULTS

extensive dendritic arbor visible in the ganglion cell layer. Positive ZnT3 staining was identified
as a speckle formation outlining a cell along its perimeter. From a total of 120 ipRGCs, 47.5%
were identified as melanopsin single-labelled cells while 52.5% were identified as melanopsin
ZnT3 double-labelled cells.
Experiment 2: Histochemical zinc expression in the SCN and IGL
A small amount of vesicular zinc staining was present throughout the SCN, which was
mostly visible in rostral sections, in the medial and ventral regions (Figure 2A-C). Quantification
took place on seven brains, with one animal excluded due to the inability to obtain representative
sections. There was no significant difference in vesicular zinc levels (as measured by ROD)
between the two time points, ZT6 and ZT18, for the dorsomedial (t(5) = 1.879, p>0.05),
dorsolateral (t(5) = 1.634, p>0.05) or ventral (t(5) =0.875, p>0.05) SCN areas (Figure 3A,B). In
contrast, a considerable amount of vesicular zinc was present throughout the full rostrocaudal
extent of the IGL and extending lower down in the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN;
Figure 2D-O). Vesicular zinc levels did not significantly differ between ZT6 and ZT18 (t(5)
=1.518, p>0.05, Figure 3C,D).
Experiment 3: Vesicular zinc is present in the IGL with or without retinal input
NPY staining was used to delineate the IGL in adjacent sections. Histochemically stained
zinc was observed in control animals as well as enucleated animals and there was no significant
difference in vesicular zinc staining in the IGL between these two groups (t(4) = 1.741, p>0.05;
Figure 4).
Experiment 4: Zinc level modification at the SCN and IGL does not alter circadian responses
to light

All 12 animals were used for analysis for SCN treatments. Data from a total of eight
hamsters were used in the analysis for IGL treatments. Histological examination led to three
animals being excluded due to missed placements for one of the two cannulas aimed at the left or
right IGL. Another animal was excluded after losing its headcap during the first manipulation.
Two more animals were excluded due to near zero phase shifts following light exposure in the
vehicle control condition. No animals were excluded based on responses to experimental
treatments.
Light-induced phase shifts did not differ significantly between the two vehicle treatment
conditions of saline and DMSO for either the intra-SCN treatment (saline: 1.820±0.258h;
DMSO: 1.686±0.326h; independent t-test, t(10) = 0.326, p=0.751) or the intra-IGL treatments
(saline: 1.854±0.640h; DMSO: 1.924±0.722h; paired t-test, t(12) = 0.192, p=0.851). As a result,
the saline and DMSO data was combined into one vehicle group in these experiments for further
analysis with the active treatment conditions (i.e., vs ZnCl2 and TPEN conditions). For intraSCN treatments (Figure 5), there was no significant difference (F(11,22)=0.926, p=0.411) in phase
shifts between the vehicle (1.764±0.194h), ZnCl2 (2.007±0.239h), or TPEN (1.669±0.193h).
Similarly for the intra-IGL experiment, there were no significant differences (F(7,13)=0.752,
p=0.491) in phase shifts between the vehicle (1.843±0.432h), ZnCl2 (1.619±0.743h), or TPEN
(1.571±0.8h) treatments (Figure 6).
Experiment 5: Circadian rhythms changes in the ZnT3 KO model
General circadian characteristics.
In a light-dark cycle, ZnT3-KO mice exhibited circadian patterns of wheel running
behavior that were similar to wildtype controls. Actograms and average waveforms for the
genotypes were of similar appearance (Figure 7). Both genotypes exhibited pronounced

nocturnal behavior with limited activity during the light phase. The L/D ratios (i.e., activity in
light phase / activity in the dark phase) were not significantly different between the genotypes
(WT: 0.029±0.022; KO: 0.036±0.028; t(10)=0.474, p=0.646). The duration of the active phase
(alpha) was similar between the genotypes (LD: WT=6.35±0.8h, KO=5.8±1.0h; t(10)=1.02,
p=0.331; DD: WT=6.6±1.0h, KO=5.8±1.59h, t(10)=1.046, p=0.320). Both wildtype and ZnT3KO mice exhibited small positive phase-angles of entrainment (WT: 6.4±0.8 min, KO: 5.8±1.0
min) that were not significantly different (t(10)=1.02, p=.331).
In constant darkness, both WT and KO mice exhibited clear free-running rhythms (Figure
8) that did not significantly differ in terms of their period (WT= 23.67±0.1h, KO=23.64±0.2h;
F(1,10)=0.090, p=0.770) or their power (Max χ2 power: WT=716.19±228.19, KO=771.73±260.62;
F(1,10)=0.586, p=0.462). Period and power significantly decreased with time in DD (main effect
of block for both period, F(2,10)=15.06, p<0.001, and power, F(2,10)=31.32, p<0.001), but this
change was similar for both genotypes (genotype X block interaction for period, F(2,10)=0.595,
p=0.561, and power, F(2,10)=0.015, p=0.985).
Masking
For the masking paradigm, LD ratios (see above) were calculated for activity that
occurred during the 12h day, 12h night, and the full 24h period when animals were housed in a
LD 2:2 cycle. During the day, the ratio of activity when the lights were on compared to when the
lights were off was not significantly different between the WT mice (0.038±0.026) and KO mice
(0.252±0.430; t(10)=1.22, p=0.251). Similarly, during the night, LD ratios were not significantly
different between WT mice (0.060±0.030), and KO mice (0.098±0.106; t(10)=0.842, p=0.419).
Total LD ratios were also not significantly different between WT (0.058±0.028) and KO mice
(0.100±0.101; t(10)=0.975, p=0.352).

Phase shifts
Phase shifts were examined following exposure to dim (40lux) and bright (1250lux) light
at CT16 and CT22, as well as following exposure to bright light at CT6. Representative phase
shifts to the bright light at CT16 and CT22 are displayed in Figure 9. Large phase delays and
advances were observed to light pulses at CT16 and CT22 respectively. At both CT16 and CT22
phase shifts were significantly larger with bright light exposure (CT16 F(1,10)=5.384, p=0.043;
CT22 F(1,10)=28.884, p<0.001). In neither case were the phase shifts significantly different
between the genotypes (CT16 F(1,10)=0.552, p=0.475; CT22 F(1,10)=0.271, p=0.614). There were
no significant interactions between genotype and light intensity (CT16 F(1,10)=0.00176, p=0.967;
CT22 F(1,10)=0.325, p=0.581). Small phase delays were observed to bright light pulses at CT6 but
did not significantly differ between the genotypes (WT -0.37±0.532h, KO -0.578±0.385,
t(9)=0.762, p=0.466).
Light-Induced Gene Expression
Light pulses (15min, 1250lux) induced prominent Fos expression in the SCN (Figure 9).
Regardless of phase or genotype, greater FOS expression was observed in the SCN core than in
the SCN shell (F(1,8)=148.87, p<0.001). None of the interactions involving region were
significant (phase: F(1,8)=0.611, p=.457; genotype: F(1,8)=0.296, p=0.601; phase x genotype:
F(1,8)=0.235, p=0.651). Additionally, no significant differences in FOS expression were observed
in relation to phase (F(1,8)=1.09, p=0.326) or genotype (F(1,8)=0.007, p=0.933). The interaction
between phase and genotype was also not significant (F(1,8)=0.002, p=0.964).
Light pulses also induced prominent mPer1 expression in the SCN (Figure 9). Regardless
of phase or genotype, greater mPer1 expression was observed in the SCN core than in the SCN
shell (F(1,14)=89.88, p<0.001). No significant differences in mPer1 expression were observed in

24
relation to phase (F(1,14)=0.191, p=0.668) or genotype (F(1,14)=0.075, p=0.789). The interaction
between region and phase was not significant (F(1,14)=0.007, p=0.932) nor was the interaction
between region and genotype, F(1,14)=0.349, p=0.564. The three-way interaction between region,
phase, and genotype was also not significant, F(1,14)=1.40, p=0.256.
DISCUSSION
The present study is the first to thoroughly examine the anatomical distribution and
functional role of vesicular zinc in the circadian system. Consistent with previous reports
(Redenti and Chappell, 2004), we localized the vesicular zinc transporter ZnT3 to the ganglion
cell layer of the retina, and demonstrated that a subset of melanopsin-containing ipRGCs
colocalized ZnT3. Minimal vesicular zinc was observed in the hamster SCN, contrasting with
previous reports that detected zinc in the rat SCN (Huang, et al., 1993). However, strong
histochemically-stained zinc was detected throughout the entire IGL structure. Vesicular zinc
staining was also observed throughout the ventrolateral geniculate. Zinc staining levels in the
SCN and IGL did not change across the circadian day. While retinal ganglion cells project to the
lateral geniculate and IGL, loss of the eyes did not significantly alter vesicular zinc staining in
these structures, suggesting that they receive significant zinc input from elsewhere in addition to
or instead of from the retina. While some ipRGCs were found to colocalize ZnT3, allowing them
to synaptically release zinc, increasing or decreasing zinc in either the SCN or IGL failed to
significantly alter circadian responses to phase shifting light pulses in hamsters. Similarly, mice
lacking ZnT3 which have no vesicular zinc, did not exhibit any differences from wildtype mice
in entrained, free-running or phase shifting circadian responses. It is possible that other circadian
tasks, such as anticipation of scheduled feeding, or other non-photic manipulations, might reveal
a difference between the WT and ZnT3 mice.

25
The colocalization of ZnT3 with ipRGCs suggest a possible function of vesicular zinc as
a modulator in the brain areas innervated by ipRGCs. A number of ipRGC subtypes have been
noted, with distinct morphologies and projection patterns (Berson et al., 2010;Sexton et al.,
2012;Schmidt et al., 2011). Specifically, the M1 type lacking BRN3b project to the SCN while
the M2 type that contains BRN3b project to the IGL. Many of the melanopsin-positive cells that
were observed to contain ZnT3 had their dendrite more in the ON sublamina of the inner
plexiform layer, suggesting that these were M2, M3, M4 or M5 ipRGCs, which project to
structures such as the dorsolateral geniculate, the superior colliculus, or the core of the olivary
pretectal nucleus (Schmidt et al., 2011). The lack of change of zinc staining in the IGL and
vLGN of enucleated hamsters does not exclude the possibility that the retina provides zincergic
input, but at a minimum requires that there also be other significant sources of vesicular zinc
input. The IGL receives considerable afferent projections from several different brain areas
including visual centers such as the superior colliculus (SC), visual cortex and dLGN (Moore et
al., 2000), the hypothalamus, and the raphe nucleus. Of these, the visual cortex is known to
contain zincergic neurons (Brown and Dyck, 2004). While manipulations of zinc levels in the
hamster IGL, or globally with the ZnT3-KO mouse failed to alter circadian responses to light,
the IGL is also known to participate in non-photic phase shifting (Webb et al., 2014). It is
possible that zinc may play a role in regulating these non-photic responses. Photic stimuli
interfere with non-photic responses (Mrosovsky, 1991) so it is possible that zincergic input to the
IGL might modulate this phenomenon.
Vesicular zinc is found in high levels in the retina, largely in the photoreceptor cells,
amacrine cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells (Ugarte and Osborne, 2001). The location of
vesicular zinc in photoreceptors changes with the light cycle, but this appears to be a light-

26
regulated rather than a circadian-regulated feature (Ugarte and Osborne, 2001). In the retina,
vesicular zinc may play a number of roles. ZnT3 is found in a number of retinal cells (Redenti
and Chappell, 2004), and synaptically-released zinc appears to modulate NMDA and GABA
receptors in a number of retinal circuits (Ripps and Chappell, 2014;Ugarte and Osborne, 2001).
Zinc also regulates the activity of retinol dehydrogenase necessary for the production of retinal.
This latter role is thought to explain night-blindness and poor dark adaptation in people with zinc
deficiencies (Ugarte and Osborne, 2001). Patients with zinc deficiencies take longer to adapt to
darkness and are less sensitive when fully adapted (Morrison et al., 1978). Circadian responses to
light are influenced by dark adaptation, with responses to light increasing with time in constant
darkness (Daymude and Refinetti, 1999;Refinetti, 2001;Shimomura and Menaker, 1994).
However, the timescale for maximal dark adaptation of circadian responses, about 3 weeks, far
exceeds the timescale for dark adaptation of visual responses in people (~40 min;Pirenne, 1962).
Given the lack of difference in phase shifts between WT and ZnT3-KO mice, it is likely that if
vesicular zinc plays a role in dark adaptation of the circadian response, then this many be
mediated by free zinc rather than synaptically-released zinc that requires the ZnT3 transporter.
A role for vesicular zinc in the SCN has been suggested previously (Huang, et al., 1993).
In rats, using a technique similar to that employed here, those authors detected prominent
zincergic input to the ventral region of the SCN. It was found that zinc enhanced inhibitory
outward potassium IA currents in isolated SCN neurons from the rat (Huang, et al., 1993).
GABAA currents are also zinc sensitive in the rat SCN (Kawahara, et al., 1993;Strecker, et al.,
1999). The sensitivity of these GABA-induced current to zinc varies over the day
(Kretschmannova et al., 2005;Kretschmannova et al., 2003). Finally, NMDA currents in the SCN
are also inhibited in vitro by zinc, an observation which has been used as evidence of the

presence of the zinc-sensitive GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor (Clark and Kofuji, 2010).
The lack of responses to manipulations of zinc in our study could reflect species differences
between rats used in these other studies and hamsters and mice explored here. Alternatively, the
pharmacological responses observed in vitro in these other studies may not translate to the intact
behaving animals explored here.
The transgenic mouse model used here has lacked the ZnT3 transporter since
fertilization, thus there may be developmental compensation to mitigate the persistent lack of
vesicular zinc. Similar to what we observed with our circadian investigations, ZnT3 mice do not
differ from WT mice on a wide variety of behavioural tasks (Cole et al., 2001). Recent evidence
suggest that differences do start to emerge when tasks are designed to be especially
sensitive/challenging, or when the animals are subjected to stress (McAllister et al.,
2018;Thackray et al., 2017;Wu and Dyck, 2018).
Zinc is a critical essential trace element that participates in a wide variety of biochemical
processes. With the present study, we have found that the transporter responsible for packaging
zinc into synaptic vesicles is located in a subset of melanopsin-containing ipRGCs, and that
vesicular zinc is found throughout the IGL. Despite this, altering zinc levels in the circadian
system with zinc donors or chelators did not alter circadian responses to light, and genetic
deletion of the necessary transporter for packaging of vesicular zinc did not alter any of the
entrained, free-running or phase shifting circadian responses. While our study provides evidence
for the presence of vesicular zinc in the wider circadian network (i.e., retina and IGL), our
current approaches failed to find a functional role for vesicular zinc in the circadian system.

Figure 1 Representative mouse retinal section showing immunofluorescent staining for ZnT3
(top row, green arrows) and melanopsin cells (middle row, red arrow) in the ganglion
cell layer (GCL). The bottom row shows a merged image from which colocalization
can be deciphered. Three single-labeled ZnT3-IR cells (green arrows) are evident, as
is one double-labeled ZnT3+ melanopsin cell (yellow arrow). Scale bar = 30µm.
Figure 2 Photomicrographs of representative hamster coronal slices showing
autometallographic zinc staining in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN; rostral to
caudal direction A-C) and left intergeniculate leaflet (denoted by boxed area; rostral
to caudal direction D to O). Vesicular zinc staining extends down into the
ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN) but was completely absent from the
dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN).
Figure 3 Photomicrographs of representative hamster coronal slices showing levels of
vesicular zinc staining in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN, A+B) and the
intergeniculate leaflet (IGL, C+D) at ZT6 (A+C) and ZT18 (B+D). No significant
differences were found between the time points, p>0.05.
Figure 4 Photomicrographs of representative hamster coronal slices showing vesicular zinc
staining in the IGL from animals with intact retinas (A) and from enucleated animals
(B). No significant difference was found between the two conditions, p>0.05. IGL
staining was confirmed by matching an adjacent delineated NPY region (C) to that of
the presumed IGL region (B; boxed area). Matching blood vessel landmarks are
denoted by (*) for comparison and matching purposes.
