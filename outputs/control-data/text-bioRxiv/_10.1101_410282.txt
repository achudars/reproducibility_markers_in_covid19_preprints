due to its inability to retrieve unassembled viral RNA. To address this, we developed a novel application of

current nucleic acid hybridization technologies for direct characterization of RNA. In particular, we modified a

current enrichment protocol to capture whole viral native RNA genomes for downstream RNA assays to

circumvent the abovementioned problems. This technique involves hybridization of biotinylated baits at 500

nucleotides (nt) intervals, stringent washes and release of free native RNA strands using DNase I treatment,

with a turnaround time of about 6 h 15 min. RT-qPCR was used as the primary proof of concept that capture-

based purification indeed removes host background. Subsequently, capture-based purification was applied to

direct RNA sequencing as proof of concept that capture-based purification can be coupled with downstream

RNA assays. We report that this protocol was able to successfully purify viral RNA by 561-791 fold. We also

report that application of this protocol to direct RNA sequencing yielded a reduction in human host RNA

background by 1580 fold, a 99.91% recovery of viral genome with at least 15x coverage, and a mean coverage

across the genome of 120x. This report is, to the best of our knowledge, the first description of a capture-

based purification method for assays that involve direct manipulation or characterisation of native RNA. This

report also describes a successful application of capture-based purification as a direct RNA sequencing strategy

that addresses certain limitations of current strategies in sequencing RNA viral genomes.

INTRODUCTION
Viruses with RNA genomes are the cause of many infectious diseases with serious consequences to human

health and mortality such as flaviviruses, HIV-1, SARS-coronavirus, HTLV-1 and influenza virus (Cantara et al.

2014).

role

in

and

viral

replication. However, extraction of viral RNA directly from culture often yields viral RNA with high host RNA

background (Marston et al. 2013).

To

deal

with

this

issue,

two

main

strategies

are

employed.

Firstly,

extracted

viral

RNA

can

be

reverse

transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) and amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to suit the

sensitivities

of

the

downstream

assays

(Ozsolak

and

Milos

2011).

Following

conversion

to

cDNA

and

amplification, in vitro transcription is then performed to retrieve genetic information in its RNA form, since

both RNA-RNA interactions and RNA intramolecular structure can only be observed whilst in this form (Peattie

1979). Indeed, both Romero-López et al. (2018) and Witteveldt et al. (2013) amplified viral RNA obtained from

cell culture via PCR amplification of viral cDNA clones followed by in vitro transcription. It has been shown,

however,

that

such

indirect

methods

for

probing

inherent

properties

of

RNA

increases

experimental

throughput at the expense of introducing PCR-induced artifacts and biases (Acinas et al. 2005), potentially

clouding our understanding of

these properties (Ozsolak et al. 2009). Secondly, isopycnic ultracentrifugation

can be used to retrieve high purity samples of viral particles containing viral RNA, which can be subsequently

extracted for downstream RNA assays. One example is the use of a sucrose density gradient to purify DENV2

RNA for RNA tertiary structure analysis (Dethoff et al. 2018). While the use of isopycnic centrifugation allows

for a high purity of viral RNA, only RNA from encapsulated viruses are obtained (Liu et al. 2011), making this

technique unfeasible for the study of unassembled viral genomes, which have also been shown to be crucial to

our understanding of viral replication machinery (Manokaran et al. 2015; Moon et al. 2015).

rd

With the advent of 3

generation nanopore sequencing, direct RNA sequencing of native RNA strands is

heralded as a PCR and cDNA-bias free sequencing technology (Garalde et al. 2018). However, the direct RNA

sequencing of RNA viral genomes is similarly affected by high amounts of host RNA background in viral

cultures. The only method to date which addresses this issue is the use of custom sequencing adapters which

has been demonstrated to yield high sequencing coverage for RNA viruses. Keller et al. (2018) utilized a

custom sequencing adapter complimentary to the 3’ end of influenza A viral genome to selectively sequence

only the viral RNA. However, this strategy is unviable for samples with diverse viral strains or genotypes where

the 3’ sequence is unknown or non-conserved. An appropriate example is the wide diversity in hepatitis C virus

genotypes, which has caused issues in PCR primer design for target enrichment strategies due to sequence

ambiguity (Thomson et al. 2016). Similarly, Cowan et al. (2005) noted that PCR-based enrichment techniques

where a priori knowledge of target sequences is required for PCR primer design render the enrichment

strategies ineffective in the characterization of novel viruses. It follows that the same sequence ambiguity in

viral genomes would pose a problem for using customized sequencing adapters during direct RNA sequencing.

From the abovementioned problems, we identified a need for an alternative technique that isolates viral RNA

molecules from host RNA background without PCR amplification or cDNA synthesis. In the case of direct RNA

sequencing, such a technique should address the limitations presented by current strategies. In this study, we

Subsequently,

as an alternative to current strategies will also be discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Viral culture
Viral inoculum and Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Japanese Tissue Repository) were cultured in DMEM

2

media (10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% Penicillin Streptomycin) up to 70-90% confluency in Corning® 150 cm

cell

culture flasks (Sigma Aldrich). Prior to infection, spent media was discarded and Huh-7 cell monolayer was

washed with 10 mL 1x PBS twice. Viral inoculum was provided by Low et al. (2006). A multiplicity of infection

of 1 was used, 2 mL dengue virus strain D1/SG/05K2402DK1/2005-1-I (DENV1) was diluted with 2 mL pure

DMEM media and mixed via pipetting up and down 5 times. Four milliliters of diluted virus was pipetted into

each flask and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Flasks were rocked every 15 min.

Subsequently, inoculum was

removed via pipette and 30 mL of pure DMEM media was pipetted to each flask was incubated at 37°C for 30

h.

Trizol extraction of total RNA
Extractions were separately performed on viral supernatant and cell lysates. Media of infected flasks (viral

supernatant) was transferred to a 50 mL Falcon tube. Subsequently the cell monolayer of each flask was

treated with 8 mL of Trizol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) and 2.25 mL of 1x PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed

by incubation at 37°C for 10 min. One milliliter aliquots of this cell lysate mixture were then pipetted to 1.5 mL

Eppendorf tubes. 250 µL aliquots of viral supernatant were also pipetted into individual tubes and treated with

750 µL of Trizol LS Regeant.

200 µL of chloroform was then added to individual aliquots of viral supernatant

and cell lysate before incubation at room temperature for 10 min. Tubes were shaken vigorously by hand for

30 s, and subsequently inverted by hand every 3 min. Each tube was centrifuged at 12 000 g, 4°C for 15 min.

Upper aqueous phase in each tube was carefully removed and pipetted to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube

(approximately 500 µL). Two microliters of Glycoblue Coprecipitant (Invitrogen) and 500 µL of isopropanol

(Sigma Aldrich) was added to each new tube and stored in -80°C overnight (or longer). Prior to the capture

step, tubes were centrifuged at 12 000 g, 4°C for 15 min and supernatant was discarded. Pellet was re-

suspended in 500 µL 75% ethanol diluted with nuclease-free water. Tubes were centrifuged again at 7 500 g,

Viral RNA was released from the beads via DNase I treatment. Beads were re-suspended in

20 µL of nuclease-free water, incubated at 95°C for 3 min then cooled to 37°C. Subsequently, 2.7 µL of 10x

reaction buffer and 4 µL of TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the reaction and mixed by

pipetting up and down 5 times, followed by further incubation at 37°C for 40 min. Subsequently, the tube was

placed on a magnetic rack to allow the beads to aggregate. The supernatant was then transferred to a clean

1.5 mL Eppendorf tube for a 2.2x Agencourt RNAClean XP beads clean-up (Beckman Coulter). Briefly, 58.7 µL of

beads were added to the supernatant and incubated for 8 min at room temperature, and then 2 min on a

magnetic rack. The beads were washed twice with 75% Ethanol and residual ethanol was air-dried. The beads

were then re-eluted in 30 µL of nuclease-free water.

ViiA 7 Real Time-PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with the program shown in Table S3 and analyzed using

QuantStudio Real-Time PCR Software v1.1 (Applied Biosystems). Each plate included a non-template control

for each pair of primers to check for PCR contamination. Samples were quantified in duplicate and non-

template controls in triplicate.

A standard curve was constructed using a serial dilution of an oligo complementary to the primer target in

accordance with MIQE Guidelines (Taylor et al. 2010). Custom oligoes of primer targets were ordered from

Integrated DNA Technologies. Serial dilution was performed with nuclease-free water to obtain concentrations

n

of 2.41x10

copies/µL (where n=9,8,7,…,2). Each dilution was quantified in duplicate. The sequences of the

oligoes, primers and probes used are shown in Table S4. Average Cq values for the serial dilutions were linearly

regressed on log2(copies/µL) and Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient was calculated. Equation

between pre and post-capture groups. The ratio of the absolute quantity of DENV1 and human RNA pre and

post-capture was compared, and purification factor calculated using Equation (2).

In this study we defined purification factor as a measure of how well host RNA background is removed from

MinION Sequencing
Pre and post-capture RNA extracted from supernatant were sequenced on the MinION. Separately, we pooled

6 captures to generate the concentrated post-cpature group. Six captures each consisiting of 30uL of purified

RNA was added to the same RNAeasy MiniKit (Qiagen) column and final elution volume was 30uL. Prior to

library preparation, all RNA samples were polyadenylated using E. Coli Poly(A) Polymerase (New England

Biolabs). The volumes of reagents shown in Table S5 were added to a thin-walled 0.5 mL PCR tube.

The reaction was then incubated in a thermocycler with the following program: 37°C for 30 min then cooled to

background. Capture yield, which is defined as the percentage of viral RNA amount captured, was calculated to

be 6.98%-40.4%.

Figure S1 shows the standard curves for DENV1 and GAPDH primers. The primer efficiency of DENV1 and

GAPDH was 0.66 and 0.92 respectively. The DENV1 primer set used was a pre-optimized primer set that is able

to detect all 4 dengue virus serotypes previously used and therefore contains ambiguous bases, explaining the

-ΔΔCT

lower primer efficiency. It was noted that relative quantification using the 2

method (Schmittgen and Livak

2008) was not appropriate as the primer efficiencies of DENV1 and GAPDH primer sets were not comparable.

Absolute quantification and subsequent ratio comparison of viral and host RNA amounts is therefore more

accurate in the determination of purification factor. All obtained values were within the dynamic linear range

and limit of detection of the reaction conditions and primer sets used, suggesting reliability and accuracy of

the reported RT-qPCR results.

MinION sequencing
Based on the mapping rates to human and DENV1 reference genomes for pre and post-capture groups, shown

in Table 2, purification factor was calculated to be 272 fold. We also report a 3.89 fold increase in percentage

recovery of DENV1 genome over 15x coverage from a single pre-capture to a single post-capture RNA sample.

On the other hand, comparing the concentrated post-capture group (containing a pool of 6 captures) to the

pre-capture group yielded a purification factor of 1580 fold and a 14 fold increase in the percentage recovery

of DENV1 genome above with at least 15x coverage from 7.05% to 99.91%.

Supplementary figures 2, 3, and 4

show representative coverage plots for the pre-capture, post-capture and concentrated post-capture groups

respectively.

In Equation (3) and (4), a binomial distribution was used to determine the minimum read coverage, n, required

to have a 0.95 confidence that k reads mapping to a particular base, X, are correctly called. We used the

average error read rate of our runs as the probability, p, of correctly calling and mapping a single base.

DISCUSSION
Capture-based purification removes high host background
We demonstrated with RT-qPCR that our novel RNA capture technique can be used to retrieve and purify viral

RNA in its native form for downstream assays. This was corroborated by our direct RNA sequencing results.

Indeed, unpurified viral RNA represented by the pre-capture group did not produce sufficient throughput for

any meaningful downstream analysis due to the indiscriminate nature of the sequencing of both host and viral

RNA. However, after treatment with our capture method, the amount of host RNA background has decreased

greatly as seen from the 272 fold increase in mapping rates to target viral RNA. In comparison, even with the

incorporation of PCR amplification for shotgun sequencing of enterovirus, Jensen et al. (2015) reported only a

2-13 fold increase in mapping rates to enterovirus. Moreover, Wongsurawat et al. (2019) observed only a 36

fold increase in mapping rates to Zika virus (ZIKV). This suggests that our capture-based purification method is

highly successful in the removal of host RNA background. The minimum coverage required for variant calling

was, as described above, benchmarked to that of Illumina reads so that the effectiveness of our capture-based

purification method could be more accurately evaluated based on the higher error read rates of direct RNA

sequencing technology. Even with the higher adjusted heuristic for variant calling of 15x, the 3.89 fold increase

in percentage of the genome above 15x coverage suggests that application of our capture-based purification

method increases the amount of target genetic information retrieved.

Capture-based purification is robust
Our method fundamentally allows for the capture of unknown viral strains and genotypes due to the flexibility

of adding multiple baits complementary to different regions of the viral genome, or even multiple baits specific

to different viruses in a single capture. Indeed, Deviatkin et al. (2017) has reported the successful use of genus-

specific degenerate baits for hybridization-based enrichment, which can be seamlessly incorporated into our

bait design. By extension, the baits used can be appropriately modified according to the intended research

focus. The robustness of this capture-based purification method therefore not only broadens the applicability

of direct RNA sequencing on studying unknown viruses but also the applicability of a diverse range of direct

RNA probing technologies.

Limitations
One point of concern for our protocol is the low capture yield. However, it must be noted that the capture

yield is still significantly higher than that of conventional viral purification methods. Hall et al. (2014), in a study

evaluating conventional viral purification methods, reported a 100 fold decrease in viral copy number post-

treatment, whereas our method results in, at most, a 14 fold decrease in viral copy number. In evaluating our

capture-based purification method, a wide range in capture yield was observed, which was due to the high

sensitivity of RNA to potential contamination during handling. This is a problem common to any viral RNA

purification method.

comparable to the time required for isopycnic gradient-based methods (Buclez et al. 2016). While there is a

significant loss of viral RNA post capture, we also note that our capture method is scalable. Multiple captures

.

can be performed and purified RNA pooled together before re-concentrating in the final bead clean-up step

The concentrated post-capture group was a demonstration of how our capture-based purification method was

appropriately scaled to suit the sensitivity of direct RNA sequencing. Indeed, after comparison of the post-

capture and concentrated post-capture sequencing runs (Table 2), the 2.5 fold increase in the percentage of

reads mapping to DENV1 suggests that scaling our method greatly improved the signal-to-noise ratio of this

particular downstream RNA assay. While it was opined that this improvement would similarly be observed in

other downstream RNA assays, further experimental verification is required.

Application of capture-based purification to direct RNA sequencing
The use of direct RNA sequencing to study viral genomes is limited by its sensitivity. Conventionally, the

sequencing adapter used in direct RNA sequencing was a poly(T) adapter which would hybridize with poly(A)

tails, facilitating adapter ligation (Garalde et al. 2018). This poly(T) adapter is also the sequencing adapter

provided in the direct RNA sequencing library preparation kit (SQK-RNA001). Currently, four strategies may be

employed for direct RNA sequencing of RNA viruses. Firstly, as described by Keller et al. (2018), a custom

adapter can be used during library preparation. The second strategy is the use of the conventional poly(T)

adapter supplied in the kit by polyadenylation of RNA prior to library preparation and sequencing. The third

strategy is to couple polyadenylation with capture-based purification. The fourth is to couple polyadenylation

with host rRNA depletion (Wongsurawat et al. 2019). A summary of the advantages and disadvantages for

these strategies are presented in Table 3.

The custom adapter strategy employed by Keller et al. (2018) greatly improves sequencing specificity, and was

demonstrated to yield 98.8% of reads mapping to influenza A. This strategy allows sequencing of RNA viruses

with or without an inherent poly(A) tail since the conventional poly(T) adapter was substituted with a custom

sequencing adapter specific to the target. However, one drawback of this strategy is that foreknowledge of the

3’ end of RNA targets is required. This entails that sequencing of unknown, novel, or mutant viruses would be

difficult.

Another

limitation

is

that

this

strategy

may

be

ineffective

in

cases

where

the

RNA

sample

is

fragmented since the 3’ end of each fragment of viral RNA is distinct.

Degenerate adapters may be used to circumvent the first limitation, as with the degenerate adapters at the +4

position used by Keller et al. (2018). However, using degenerate adapters would only be able to address the

problem of mutant viruses but not that of novel or unknown viruses. Indeed, foreknowledge of target 3’

sequences is still required. On the other hand, attempts at using multiple adapters at different locations on the

target genome cannot address the problem of RNA fragmentation. Custom adapters must be specific to the 3’

end of each fragment for ligation. In most laboratory samples, however, RNA is stochastically fragmented. As

such, determination of the exact 3’ end of each fragment would be impossible and so such methods to

circumvent the problem of RNA fragmentation are unviable.

In this study, we demonstrated the second and third strategies, which make use of the conventional poly(T)

adapter. This was done using DENV1, a positive single stranded RNA virus lacking a poly(A) tail. The protocol

used to generate the pre-capture group sequencing results employ the second strategy while that for the post-

capture and concentrated post-capture results employ the third. The polyadenylation of RNA and subsequent

use of the conventional poly(T) adapter has several advantages. First, the polyadenylation of RNA prior to

library preparation and sequencing allows for sequencing of RNA viruses with or without an inherent poly(A)

tail.

Second, usage of the conventional poly(T) adapter removes the need for any foreknowledge of the target

sequence. Third, all RNA fragments would be ligated with adapters since the adapters are not sequence

specific, circumventing the problem of fragmented RNA. However, the main disadvantage strategies involving

polyadenylation of RNA is that sequencing specificity is greatly reduced as host mRNA transcripts include a

poly(A) tail and will also be sequenced. Wongsurawat et al. (2019) independently replicated our pre-capture

group results but with ZIKV, which is also a positive single stranded RNA virus lacking a poly(A) tail in the family

Flaviviridae. The authors observed 0.11% of reads mapping to ZIKV, which corroborates the low 0.63% of reads

mapping to DENV1 in our pre-capture sequencing run. The authors also reported 3.89% of reads mapping to

ZIKV

whilst

employing

the

fourth

strategy.

The

low

percentage

of

target

reads

underscores

this

main

disadvantage of sequencing specificity.

The issue of low sequencing specificity is, however, less pronounced in the third strategy. Comparing the

second strategy (pre-capture) and third strategy (post-capture), there is a 50 fold increase in percentage of

reads mapping to DENV1. Furthermore, a comparison of pre-capture and concentrated post-capture results

yields a 123 fold increase in mapping rates to DENV1. This suggests that while simply polyadenylating RNA

samples leads to low sequencing specificity, applying our capture-based purification prior allows us to reap the

advantages of using the conventional poly(T) adapter whilst having a significantly higher sequence specificity.

Additionally, coupling capture-based purification with polyadenylation yields a higher target mapping rate of

31.31% with regard to the 3.98% observed when the fourth strategy was employed (Wongsurawat et al. 2019).

This suggests that the third strategy is superior with respect to sequencing specificity when compared to the

fourth strategy. It is noted, however, that the sequencing specificity of the third strategy was still lower than

that of the first strategy.

Moreover, applying capture-based purification in the third strategy significantly

increases the turnaround time as compared to the first, second and fourth strategy. Therefore, it is suggested

that the third strategy should only be employed where foreknowledge of the viral sequence at hand is limited,

or where RNA integrity is low. It is also suggested that the second and fourth strategy be used in cases where

In this study, we demonstrated a novel capture-based method for the purification of viral RNA from host RNA.

In addition, we described a successful attempt of applying our capture method to the direct RNA sequencing of

viral culture, using a DENV1 model, exemplifying how our capture method could significantly remove host

background in downstream assays requiring viral RNA in its native form. Further improvements to the capture

yield are underway and could potentially expand its application to clinical samples where starting RNA material

is low. The fundamental advantages of using our capture-based purification method makes it a superior

alternative to conventional viral purification methods and addresses limitations of current strategies for direct

RNA sequencing, potentially paving a new path for the characterization and direct RNA sequencing of viral

RNA.
