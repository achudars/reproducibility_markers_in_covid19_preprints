ABSTRACT
Upon a wide range of stress conditions (e.g., nutrient, antibiotic, oxidative), a subpopulation of
bacterial cells known as persisters survive by halting metabolism. These cells resuscitate rapidly to
reconstitute infections once the stress is removed and nutrients are provided. However, how these
5

dormant cells resuscitate is not understood well but involves reactivating ribosomes. By screening 10,000
compounds directly for stimulating Escherichia coli persister cell resuscitation, we identified that 2-{[2(4-bromophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]thio}-3-ethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro[1]benzothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one
(BPOET) stimulates resuscitation. Critically, by screening 4,267 E. coli proteins, we determined that
BPOET activates hibernating ribosomes via 23S rRNA pseudouridine synthase RluD, which increases

10

ribosome activity. Corroborating the increased waking with RluD, production of RluD increased the
number of active ribosomes in persister cells. Also, inactivating the small RNA RybB which represses
rluD led to faster persister resuscitation. Hence, persister cells resuscitate via activation of RluD.

INTRODUCTION
15

Upon myriad stresses such as antibiotic stress, a sub-population of bacterial cells becomes dormant
and multi-stress tolerant (1, 2); these cells are known as persisters. The persister phenotype is not due to
genetic change, since upon re-growth, persisters cells behave the same as the original culture. Persistence
is relevant in the environment since almost all cells face starvation (3) and relevant in medicine since
recurring infections may be the result of regrowth of persister cells (4). The persister sub-population

20

should be distinguished from slow-growing cells such as those in the stationary-phase or those generated
by nutrient shifts (5); these slow-growing cells may be distinguished from persisters since the whole
population of slow-growing cells are tolerant to antimicrobials whereas the non-growing persister
population is a small sub-population (less than 1%) (6). This distinction is critical since tolerant cells
utilize alternate sigma factors like RpoS in Escherichia coli to redirect gene expression as an active

25

response against stress (7), whereas persisters cease responding and become dormant (5, 8).
To treat persister cell infections, it is important to understand how they form and how they resuscitate.
The prevailing view for their formation (6) is that to reduce metabolism, cells activate toxins of
toxin/antitoxin (TA) systems (9). The best genetic evidence for this is that deletion of toxins MqsR (10,
11), TisB (12), and YafQ (13) decreases persistence. Moreover, production of non-TAs toxins also

30

increases persistence (14). However, since nutrient deprivation also results in persistence (15), the subpopulation of cells may become dormant simply by running out of food. In addition, we have proposed a
model whereby the alarmone ppGpp (synthesized as a result of myriad stress conditions), directly creates
persister cells via ribosome dimerization, without the need of TA systems (16). Regardless of the
mechanism, persistence appears to be an elegantly-regulated response to an unfavorable environment

35

(17).
In regard to resuscitating persister cells, little has been determined about the mechanism. It has been
suggested that persister cells resuscitate by inactivating toxins such as TacT acetyltransferase via
peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase Pth (18), but this has not been demonstrated. It is established that persister cells
revive in response primarily to environmental signals, such as fresh nutrients (rather than stochastically)

(19). In addition, persisters revive in an heterogeneous manner, by activating ribosomes; cells increase
their ribosome content until a threshold is reached, then they begin to elongate or divide (19). For
resuscitation, the persisters sense nutrients by chemotaxis and phosphotransferase membrane proteins,
reduce cAMP levels to rescue stalled ribosomes, unhybridize 100S ribosomes via HflX, and undergo
chemotaxis toward fresh nutrients (20).

45

In the present study, to discern additional insights into how ribosomes are active as persister cells
resuscitate, we converted the complete E. coli population into persister cells so that we could screen for
the first time compounds that enhance persister resuscitation. From a 10,000 compound library, we
identified

that

2-{[2-(4-bromophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]thio}-3-ethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro[1]benzothieno[2,3-

d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (BPOET) stimulates persister cell waking. Critically, we determined that the
50

mechanism by which BPOET resuscitates persisters is via activation of the 23S rRNA pseudouridine
synthase RluD, which is important for ribosome activity. Hence, BPOET stimulates persister resuscitation
by activating ribosomes via RluD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacteria and growth conditions. E. coli K-12 and its isogenic mutants (Table 1) were grown routinely

55

in lysogeny broth (21) (22) at 37oC. BPOET was obtained from ChemBridge (San Diego, CA).
Persister cells. E. coli persister cells were generated (19, 23) by treating exponentially-growing cells
(turbidity of 0.8 at 600 nm) with rifampicin (100 µg/mL) for 30 min to stop transcription, centrifuging,
and adding LB with ampicillin (100 µg/mL) for 3 h to lyse any non-persister cells. Cells pellets were
washed twice with 0.85% NaCl then re-suspended in 0.85% NaCl.

60

ChemBridge screen to identify resuscitation compounds. To identify compounds that resuscitate E.
coli persister cells, the DIVERset Library from ChemBridge (San Diego, CA) containing 10,000 druglike
compounds with high pharmacophore diversity was evaluated by adding 4 µL of each compound (final
concentration 100 µM, dissolved in DMSO) to 186 µL of LB in 96 well plates and then adding 10 µL of
persister cells. The negative control was 2 vol% DMSO. Resuscitation was calculated as the change in

turbidity at 600 nm. The compounds that were identified initially were re-tested in M9 minimal medium
with 5X alanine (24).
Pooled ASKA screen to identify resuscitation proteins. To identify proteins responsible for
resuscitation, all 4,267 ASKA clones (GFP-) (25) were combined, grown to a turbidity of 2 at 600 nm in
LB medium, and their plasmids isolated using a plasmid DNA Mini Kit I (OMEGA Bio-Tek, Inc.,

70

Norcross, GA, USA). The pooled ASKA plasmids (1 µL containing 30 ng DNA) were electroporated into
50 µL of E. coli BW25113 competent cells, 1 mL LB medium was added, and the cells were grown to a
turbidity of 0.5 at 600 nm. Chloramphenicol was added (30 µg/mL) to the culture to maintain the
plasmids, and the cells were incubated at 250 rpm to a turbidity of 0.8. Rifampicin followed by ampicillin
was added to make persister cells, then the persister cells were washed twice with 1x PBS buffer,

75

contacted with 100 µM BPOET for 2 h in M9 medium that lacked a carbons source, and plated on LB
(Cm) agar plates. Faster colony appearance indicated faster persister resuscitation. Plasmids were isolated
from the colonies and sequenced using primer pCA24N_F: GCCCTTTCGTCTTCACCTCG.
Single-cell persister resuscitation. As described previously (19), 5 µL of cell populations consisting of
100% persister cells were added to 1.5% agarose gel pads containing either M9 medium with glucose (0.4

80

wt%) or alanine (5X) as a carbon source (24), and resuscitation was monitored at 37°C via a light
microscope (Zeiss Axio Scope.A1, bl_ph channel at 1000 ms exposure).
Active 70S ribosome assay. The GFP signal of resuscitating persisters of E. coli K-12 MG1655ASVGFP (26) with RluD was monitored using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioscope.A1, bl_ph
channel at 1,000 ms exposure and GFP channel at 10,000 ms exposure). E. coli K-12 MG1655-ASVGFP

85

produces an unstable variant of GFP (half-life less than 1 h) under the control of the 16S rRNA ribosomal
promoter rrnbP1 (26).

RESULTS & DISCUSSION
BPOET resuscitates E. coli persister cells. To identify compounds that resuscitate E. coli persister
cells, we first increased by 105-fold the persister cell population by pre-treating with rifampicin to cease
90

metabolism by stopping transcription followed by ampicillin treatment to kill any remaining non-persister
cells (23). In this way, nearly 100% of bacterial cell population was converted into persister cells. Hence,
we were able to both screen for compounds that more rapidly resuscitate persister cells as well as confirm
our hypotheses via single-cell microscopy. The persister cells generated in this way have been (i)
confirmed eight ways (19), (ii) used to determine that persister cells wake via ribosome activation (19)

95

and chemotaxis (20), (iii) used to show that the cells capable of resuscitation in a viable but not culturable
population are equivalent to persister cells (15), (iv) used to identify compounds that kill persister cells
(27), and (v) used to show that the alarmone ppGpp directly creates persister cells by stimulating
ribosome dimerization (16). In addition, our method to generate a high population of persister cells has
been utilized by at least six independent groups (28-33).

100

Using 96-well plates, the persister cells (10 µL) were added to 190 µL of LB containing one each of
the 10,000 compounds of the DiverSet library dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (100 µM final
concentration), and growth was monitored via the change in turbidity for up to 48 h. Starting at a turbidity
of 0.05, a 140-fold increase in growth was possible (maximum final turbidity of 0.69). Table 1 shows the
27 compounds that were identified that stimulated persister cell resuscitation relative to the negative

105

control of dimethyl sulfoxide. Upon confirming the results of these initial hits in minimal alanine
medium, we found BPOET (100 µM) was most effective and increased persister cell waking by 44-fold in
96-well plates based on the increases in turbidity as well as found that BPOET increases the waking of
single persister cells by 4-fold (Figure 1, Table S1). Hence, we focused on this compound.
BPOET resuscitates E. coli persister cells by modifying ribosomes. To determine how BPOET

110

resuscitates persister cells, we pooled the 4,267 ASKA clones in which each E. coli protein is produced
from plasmid pCA24N, produced persister cells carrying these plasmids, contacted with 100 µM BPOET,
plated the cells, and chose the largest colonies that formed on LB plates. Our rationale was that any

pathway stimulated by BPOET would be even more active if the number of rate-limiting proteins in that
pathway were increased, and cells that wake first would form colonies faster.
115

Using this approach, we identified five proteins whose production increased resuscitation: RluD, YjiK,
SrlR, Smf, and YeeZ. These proteins are related to contacting with BPOET since addition of the diluent
DMSO alone and sequencing larger colonies did not identify these five proteins but instead identified
TmcA, a tRNAMet cytidine acetyltransferase, which is a general factor required for translation that likely
led to larger colony sizes with the diluent. Of the proteins related to BPOET, only RluD (23S rRNA

120

pseudouridine synthase) and SrlR (represses the gut operon for glucitol metabolism) have been
characterized; we focused on RluD because it is related to ribosomes, and we have shown inactivating
ribosomes causes persistence (23) and activating ribosomes resuscitates persister cells (16, 19, 20). RluD
is involved in the synthesis and assembly of 70S ribosomes as well as their function based on its posttranscriptional modification of 23S rRNA to form three pseudouridine (5-ribosyl-uracil) nucelosides at

125

positions 1911, 1915, and 1917 (34). In pseudouridine, uracil is attached via a carbon-carbon bond to the
sugar base rather than through a carbon-nitrogen bond. The 23S rRNA pseudouridines increase the
stability of the tertiary structure of 23S rRNA and are located in a stem loop structure that is involved in
peptidyltransferase and interacts with mRNA, tRNA, 16S rRNA, and ribosome release factor. Hence,
RluD is responsible for efficient ribosome function (34).

130

RluD enhances persister cell resuscitation. To explore further the role of RluD and persister
resuscitation, we utilized single cell studies since persister cells are heterogeneous (19) and wake with
different frequencies (which would be missed if we monitored planktonic populations). We found that
deleting rulD reduces the frequency of single-cell persister resuscitation dramatically (11-fold) compared
to the isogenic wild-type strain on minimal glucose agarose gel pads (Fig. 1A, Table S1, Fig. S1). In

135

addition, no colonies were found on M9 glucose agar plates after inactivating RluD (Fig S2), confirming
that persister cells are severely challenged in resuscitation without RluD. Corroborating these two results
with the rluD mutant, production of RluD increased the frequency of waking by 11-fold on glucose
medium (Fig. 1A, Table S1, Fig S1) and increased waking on rich medium (results not shown). In

addition, the rluD deletion has no effect on persister cell formation (Fig S2). Therefore, RluD stimulates
140

persister cell resuscitation but does not affect persister formation.
RluD increases active ribosomes for resuscitation. Using a GFP reporter that indicates the number of
70S ribosomes in individual persister cells (19), we found that producing RluD before making persister
cells makes 85 ± 6% of the cells have high ribosome fractions compared to not producing RluD (Fig. 1B).
The GFP reporter indicates transcription of rrsB (16S rRNA), gltT (tRNA-glu), rrlB (23S rRNA) and rrfB

145

(5S rRNA); hence, it indicates production of the three major rRNA building blocks. Although this is not a
direct observation of 70S ribosomes, this method is a suitable proxy for the number of ribosomes based
on measurement of rRNA concentrations and has been used frequently (19, 35-37), and we have verified
its use by isolating ribosomes and comparing GFP fluorescence (19). Hence, the increased persister cell
resuscitation with RluD is directly due to the increase in active (70S) ribosomes of persister cells.

150

RybB antagonizes persister cell resuscitation. Since the small RNA RybB represses RluD (38), we
investigated its impact on persister resuscitation. As expected, we found that deletion of rybB increases
the frequency of persister cell waking by 8-fold (Fig. 1A, Table S1, Fig. S1).
In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that ribosomes may be activated for specific cell
cycles such as recovery from dormancy. Specifically, by screening for compounds for the first time that

155

enhance persister cell resuscitation, we have (i) determined that ribosomes are modified by RluD as cells
resuscitate and resume ribosome activity, (ii) identified a novel compound, BPOET, that activates
persister cells, and (iii) linked small RNAs to persistence. Hence, these results extend our understanding
of how persister cells are activated which has a far-reaching impact in that all bacteria cope with nutrient
stress and become dormant.

FIGURE LEGEND
Fig. 1. RluD increases persister resuscitation by increasing ribosomes for resuscitation. (A) Singlecell persister resuscitation as determined using light microscopy (Zeiss Axio Scope.A1). The total
and waking number of persister cells are shown in Table S1. Microscope images for waking cells
are shown in Fig. S1. The fold-change in resuscitation is relative to BW25113 with DMSO for
BW25113 with BPOET, relative to BW25113 for the ∆rluD mutant, relative to
BW25113/pCA24N for the strain producing RluD from pCA24N plasmid in BW25113, and
relative to MG1655 for ∆rybB. M9 glucose (0.4%) agarose gel pads were used for all the strains
except BW25113 with BPOET where M9 alanine (5X) agarose gel pads including 100 µM of
BPOET or DMSO were used. The results are the combined observations from two independent
experiments after 6 h for the BW25113 with BPOET, after 4 h for BW25113 and its deletion
mutants, and after 6 h for cells harboring pCA24N and its derivatives as well as for MG1655 and
MG1655 ∆rybB. Error bars indicate standard deviations. (B) Active 70S ribosomes in single
persister cells for MG1655‐ASV/pCA24N-rluD (“RluD”) vs. MG1655‐ASV/pCA24N
(“Empty”). Cells are shown on agarose gel pads at time 0 for resuscitation; i.e., after the
formation of persister cells. Representative results from three independent cultures are shown.
