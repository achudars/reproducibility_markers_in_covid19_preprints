Abstract

60

Tumor heterogeneity encompasses both the malignant cells and their microenvironment. While

61

heterogeneity between individual patients is well-known to affect the efficacy of anti-cancer

62

drugs, most personalized treatment approaches do not account for intratumor heterogeneity. We

63

addressed this issue by studying the heterogeneity of lymph node-derived B cell non-Hodgkin

64

lymphoma (B-NHL) by single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and transcriptome-informed

65

flow cytometry. We identified transcriptionally distinct malignant subclones and compared

66

their drug response and genomic profiles. Malignant subclones of the same patient responded

67

strikingly different to anti-cancer drugs ex vivo, which recapitulated subclone-specific drug

68

sensitivity during in vivo treatment. Tumor infiltrating T cells represented the majority of non-

69

malignant cells, whose gene expression signatures were similar across all donors, whereas the

70

frequencies of T cell subsets varied significantly between the donors. Our data provide new

71

insights into the heterogeneity of B-NHL and highlight the relevance of intratumor

72

heterogeneity for personalized cancer therapies.

Introduction

74

The genomic and transcriptional landscape of many cancer entities has been catalogued over

75

recent years, documenting the range of tumor heterogeneity between individual patients [1]. In

76

addition, it has long been appreciated that tumors within each patient consist of diverse, but

77

phylogenetically-related subclones [2]. Bulk sequencing studies of tumor cells have been

78

conducted to infer the genetic spectrum of intratumor heterogeneity from variant allele

79

frequencies of somatic mutations [3]. While important insights were gained from these studies,

80

further characterization on the single cell level is needed to more accurately dissect the pathway

81

and molecular properties associated with distinct subclones.

82

Neoplastic cells alone do not manifest a malignant disease, but attract a battery of non-

83

malignant bystander cells, which support tumor cell growth and survival. The diversity and

84

plasticity of the microenvironment constitutes another layer of heterogeneity, beyond the

85

heterogeneity of the cancer cells themselves [4]. There is solid evidence that intratumor

86

heterogeneity among malignant and non-malignant cells, and their interactions within the tumor

87

microenvironment are critical to diverse aspects of tumor biology, response to treatment, and

88

prognosis [5].

89

While bulk genomic tissue profiling has only a limited ability to reconstruct the complex

90

cellular composition of tumors, single cell DNA-sequencing [6, 7] and RNA-sequencing

91

(scRNA-seq) methods [8-11] have emerged as powerful tools to study intratumor heterogeneity

92

and reconstruct the full picture of malignant and non-malignant cells. These technologies

93

further enable researchers to identify rare cell types such as cancer stem cells [12] and

94

circulating tumor cells [13, 14], or to follow clonal dynamics during cancer treatment [15].

95

Most of these single cell studies have been used to describe distinct cell subpopulations on the

96

transcriptional level, but their functional properties, such as drug response profiles, remain

97

largely unexplored.

98

To address this, we used B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) as a model disease entity to

99

dissect intratumor heterogeneity on the transcriptional, genetic, and functional (drug response)

100

level. In parallel, we investigated the cellular heterogeneity of the B-NHL lymph node

101

microenvironment. B-NHL are a heterogenous group of hematologic malignancies that most

102

frequently grow in the lymph node compartment. Almost half of all B-NHL are classified as

103

diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) [16]. Transformation of

104

indolent FL into aggressive DLBCL is observed in approximately 10% of all FL cases [17].

105

Despite effective treatment options, 20-40% of B-NHL patients relapse multiple times and

106

present with chemotherapy refractory disease [18, 19]. The response to single agent targeted

107

therapy in these patient cohorts is surprisingly low [20, 21]. Intratumor heterogeneity might be

108

a key factor contributing to therapeutic failure and low success rate of these single agent

109

targeted therapies [3]. Understanding subclonal drug response patterns would therefore be an

110

important asset for designing more effective personalized lymphoma therapies.

111

To dissect the complex cellular composition of the malignant lymph node niche, we profiled

112

transcriptomes of malignant and non-malignant cells derived from 12 different reactive or B-

113

NHL lymph node biopsies. We further studied the variation of the cellular composition of the

114

malignant lymph node niche by flow cytometry in a larger cohort of 41 patients. Among

115

malignant cells, we identified transcriptionally distinct malignant subclones and characterized

116

these subclones further by ex-vivo drug perturbation and genome sequencing. This revealed

117

new insights into intratumor heterogeneity of B-NHL and demonstrated substantially different

118

drug responses between malignant subclones in the same patient.

Study outline

122

We designed an experimental pipeline to dissect the heterogeneity of non-malignant and

123

malignant lymph node-derived lymphocytes (Figure 1A). This involved first preparing single

124

cell suspensions of B-NHL lymph node biopsies and performing scRNA-seq. These single cell

125

transcriptomic data were then used to identify transcriptionally-distinct subclones by flow

126

cytometry using distinguishing subclone-specific surface markers, and finally the subclones

127

were functionally interrogated in drug perturbation assays with a comprehensive panel of 58

128

drugs in five concentrations, and further characterized by whole genome (WGS) and/or exome

129

sequencing (WES).

130
131

Dissecting the cellular composition of nodal B cell lymphomas

132

We assayed single cell suspensions of a total of 12 samples: four germinal center-derived

133

diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) samples, of which two were transformed from FL

134

(DLBCL1, DLBCL2, tFL1, tFL2), one non-germinal center-derived DLBCL (DLBCL3), four

135

follicular lymphoma samples (FL1, FL2, FL3, FL4), and three reactive non-malignant lymph

136

node sample (rLN1, rLN2, rLN3) by flow cytometry and droplet-based scRNA-seq

137

(Supplementary Table 1). After removal of low-quality cells, we analyzed scRNA-seq profiles

138

of 13,259 malignant and 9,296 non-malignant cells with an average sequencing depth of 1,409

139

genes per cell.

140

First, we verified that the lymph node-derived single cell suspensions were representative for

141

the cellular composition (B and T cells) of the lymphoma and its microenvironment in vivo.

142

We used sections of paraffin-embedded samples of the same lymph nodes, which were formalin

143

fixed directly after surgical excision and therefore represent the in vivo cellular composition,

144

and quantified B and T cell frequencies by immunohistochemistry (IHC, Supplementary Figure

145

1A). In parallel, we calculated B and T cell frequencies by flow cytometry and scRNA-seq in

146

single cell suspensions (Supplementary Figure 1A, B). The frequencies of B and T cells derived

147

from scRNA-seq correlated very well with the frequencies determined by flow cytometry

148

(r = 0.97, n = 12, Figure 1B) and IHC (r = 0.92, n = 7, Figure 1C).

149

Next, we aimed to distinguish malignant from non-malignant B cells and delineate these

150

populations in our single cell experiments. We took advantage of the fact that malignant B cell

151

populations express only one type of immunoglobulin light chain (LC), either κ or λ [22]. We

152

calculated the LC-ratio (κ/λ) based on RNA expression of the genes IGKC (coding for the

153

constant part of the κ LC) and IGLC2 (λ LC) for each single B cell and color-coded this ratio

in a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plot (Figure 1D, E). In the malignant

155

lymph nodes, we could either identify both a non-malignant and malignant or only malignant

156

B cell clusters (Supplementary Figure 2). In contrast, reactive lymph node samples contained

157

only non-malignant B cells (see method section for details).

158

We further evaluated the frequencies of these subsets in a larger cohort of 41 lymph node

159

samples by flow cytometry, including those samples used for scRNA-seq. Both approaches

160

showed

161

Supplementary Figure 3A, B). We found that the proportion of malignant cells was highly

162

variable across samples. It ranged from 14.6 to 97.2 % (median 79.3 %, n = 9) in DLBCL,

163

23.7 to 85.4 % (median 79.9 %, n = 12) in FL, 48.4 to 95.5 % (median 88.0 %, n = 4) in mantle

164

cell lymphoma, and 65.4 to 91.4 % (median 83.1 %, n = 7) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia

165

(Supplementary Figure 3C). This substantial cellular heterogeneity complicates bulk

166

sequencing approaches of unsorted lymph node samples, and highlights the value of single cell

167

sequencing to simultaneously study the full spectrum of malignant and non-malignant lymph

168

node cells.

Characterization of lymph node-derived T cell populations

171

T cells are key players of the host-specific tumor immunosurveillance [23]. B-NHL exhibit

172

genetic immune escape strategies that can be targeted using current therapeutic strategies [24],

173

including checkpoint inhibitors [25] and bispecific antibodies [26]. Notably, lymphoma cells

174

can also orchestrate their tumor microenvironment so that certain T cell subsets support the

175

growth and proliferation of the tumor cells [27]. Even though these subsets have been

176

extensively studied by immunophenotyping, their transcriptional heterogeneity in B-NHL

177

lymph nodes, in particular at the single cell level, still remains to be elucidated.

178

We combined single cell RNA expression profiles of T cells from all 12 donors and jointly

179

visualized them by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a dimension

180

reduction algorithm alternative to t-SNE [28]. Many well-established surface markers, which

181

are used to distinguish T cell subsets in flow cytometry studies, are insufficiently expressed on

182

the scRNA-seq level. We therefore chose unsupervised clustering to partition T cells into

183

transcriptionally distinct subsets, which were then annotated by differentially expressed marker

184

genes. All T cells from either reactive or malignant lymph nodes distributed to only four major

185

T cell subpopulations (Figure 2 A, B). Note, that clusters were not driven by patients or disease

186

entity, suggesting only limited transcriptional heterogeneity across all donors. Apart from

187

conventional T helper cells (TH; CD4, IL7R, PLAC8, KLF2) and regulatory T cells (TREG; CD4,

188

IL2RA, FOXP3, ICOS), we identified a third T helper cell population, which was characterized

189

by overexpression of PDCD1 (PD1), ICOS, CXCR5, TOX, TOX2 and CD200 (Figure 2C,

190

Supplementary Table 2), suggesting a T follicular helper cell (TFH) phenotype [29-33]. In

191

contrast to the diversity of T helper cells, we observed only one major cluster of cytotoxic T

192

cells (TTOX, GZMK, CCL4/5, GZMA, NKG7, CD8A). However, the frequencies of the four

193

identified T cell subsets were highly variable between different B-NHL donors (Figure 2D).

194

To study this variation in a larger cohort, we quantified the abovementioned T cell populations

195

in 39 lymph node samples of DLBCL, FL, mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic

196

leukemia by flow cytometry using the most distinctive markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25,

197

FoxP3, ICOS, PD1), as seen in Figure 2C. The frequencies of all T cell subsets derived from

198

scRNA-seq correlated well with the frequencies determined by flow cytometry (r = 0.69,

199

n = 10, Figure 2E). We found that TFH cells were significantly increased in FL (two-sided

200

Wilcoxon test: p = 0.006, Figure 2F), and TREG cell frequencies were significantly increased in

201

malignant lymph nodes, compared to the reactive ones (two-sided Wilcoxon test: p values as

202

indicated, Figure 2F).

203

Taken together, we demonstrated that T cells derived from malignant B-NHL lymph nodes are

204

transcriptionally similar to those derived from non-malignant reactive lymph nodes. In contrast,

205

the proportion of individual T cell subsets differed significantly between lymphoma entities and

206

individual patients. This finding indicates that B-NHL shape their microenvironment by

207

influencing the recruitment of certain T cell subpopulations, but have less effect on their

208

transcriptional programs. Therefore, studying the frequencies of lymphoma infiltrating T cell

209

subsets and their effect on the outcome after immunotherapies might be highly relevant for the

210

development of biomarkers.

211
212

Identification of gene expression signatures driving B cell heterogeneity by scRNA-seq

213

Next, we examined the heterogeneity of the malignant and non-malignant B cells. To gain a

214

global overview of the gene expression pattern across all malignant and non-malignant B cells

215

from the 12 different donors, we combined their single cell RNA expression profiles, clustered

216

them jointly and visualized them by UMAP (Figure 3A, B).

217

Clustering partitioned the non-malignant B cells into two distinct subpopulations (C0-C1,

218

Figure 3A). Among multiple differentially expressed genes between these two subsets

219

(Supplementary Table 3), we found IGHM and CD72 to be overexpressed in cluster C0, which

220

characterizes naïve B cells [34], and CD27 and IGHG1 to be overexpressed in cluster C1, which

221

characterizes memory B cells [35].

222

Of the eight transcriptionally distinct clusters formed by the malignant B cells (C2-C9, Figure

223

3A), six exclusively contained cells of only one donor (Figure 3A, B). This suggests a higher

224

degree of inter-patient heterogeneity for malignant than for non-malignant B cells. We

225

performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the mean expression differences between

226

each malignant B cell cluster and all non-malignant cells, which revealed multiple cluster-

227

specific gene sets (Figure 3C). Germinal center (GC)-associated gene expression signatures

228

were significantly enriched in all clusters except for cluster 6, which exclusively contained

229

malignant B cells of DLBCL3. This finding supports the classification of all B-NHL cells as

230

either GCB type DLBCL or FL, except for the remaining DLBCL3 sample, which was

231

classified as a non-GCB type DLBCL based on the Hans-classifier (Supplementary

232

Table 1) [36]. Individual clusters were characterized by oncogenic transcriptional programs,

233

which indicated activation of oncogenic MYC or STK33 signaling (Figure 3D).

234

Inter-patient heterogeneity of B cell lymphomas also comprises their proliferative capacity,

235

which can vary from very low in FL to very high in DLBCL. We determined the proportion of

236

B cells in S, G2 or M phase based on their single cell RNA profile (Supplementary Figure 4A)

237

and observed a high correlation with flow cytometry- and IHC-based staining of Ki67 (R = 0.83

238

scRNA-seq to flow cytometry, R = 0.92, scRNA-seq to IHC, Supplementary Figure 4B).

239

In summary, these results indicate that inter-patient heterogeneity of malignant B cells,

240

including their diverse proliferative activity, can be captured by the scRNA-Seq and can be

241

linked to lymphoma-specific transcription signatures. Non-malignant B cells, however, had

242

similar transcriptional profiles across different donors.

243
244

Decoding the crosstalk between T cells and malignant B cells in the lymph node

245

microenvironment

246

Above, we concluded that B cell lymphomas shape their microenvironment by modulating the

247

frequency of different subsets of lymphoma infiltrating T cells. We now aimed to understand

248

through which potential ligand-receptor interactions malignant B cells could benefit from their

249

specific T cell microenvironment. For this purpose, we adopted a computational approach

250

described by Vento-Tormo et al. [37] and analyzed 760 known ligand-receptor combinations

251

(Supplementary Table 4) to identify the most significant interactions between malignant B cells

252

and lymphoma infiltrating T cells within the lymph node microenvironment (Figure 4A).

253

This analysis suggested that malignant B cells could receive costimulatory and coinhibitory

254

signals by all four major T cell subsets, via CD80/CD86-CD28 and CD80/CD86-CTLA, while

255

interactions via BCMA-BAFF, BAFF-R-BAFF and CD40-CD40LG could predominantly be

256

mediated by TH or TREG cells. Significant interaction scores of IL4-IL4R and IL4-IL13RA1

257

were exclusively observed between TFH and malignant B cells, providing further evidence that

258

TFH cells represent the most important source of IL4 production in B cell lymphoma [38]. This

259

observation might be of clinical relevance because the IL4/IL4R interaction is discussed as

260

potential resistance mechanism against Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors [39, 40]. In

261

line with the current state of knowledge [41-43], we also observed strong interaction scores for

262

TFH via IL21-IL21R with malignant B cells and via IL2-IL2R with other T cell subsets. This

263

analysis supports the classification of TFH cell as one of the four main T cell subsets within the

264

lymph node microenvironment and reveals that each subset may provide a distinct panel of

265

stimuli to interact with malignant B cells.

266
267

Dissecting transcriptional intratumor heterogeneity using multicolor flow cytometry

268

Intratumor heterogeneity of nodal B cell lymphoma is a well-known phenomenon, however,

269

most available studies infer intratumor heterogeneity from variant allele frequencies of genetic

270

alterations corrected for purity, ploidy and multiplicity of local copy number [44, 45].

271

Here, we aimed to investigate the genomic, transcriptomic and functional (drug response) layers

272

of intratumor heterogeneity from single cells. Unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq profiles

273

of malignant and non-malignant B cells revealed that all malignant samples were composed of

274

at least two or more transcriptionally distinct subclusters (Supplementary Figure 5). We aimed

275

to validate scRNA-based clusters at the cellular level to understand if this clustering represents

276

biologically and clinically relevant differences. Therefore, we selected three samples (FL4,

277

tFL1, DLBCL1) based on the availability of material for follow-up studies. We inferred

278

differentially expressed surface markers from single cell expression profiles and first validated

279

the distinction of scRNA-based clusters by flow cytometry. In a second step, we cultured lymph

280

node derived lymphocytes with 58 different drugs in 5 concentrations (Supplementary Table 5)

281

and stained them with specific antibody combinations to assess their drug response profiles by

282

flow cytometry. In a third step, we sorted subpopulation and performed genome sequencing for

283

each subclone (tFL1, DLBCL1).

284
285

Verifying five transcriptionally distinct clusters in follicular lymphoma sample

286

The FL4 sample was collected at initial diagnosis. Based on single cell gene expression

287

profiling, we identified five different B cell subpopulations (Supplementary Figure 6A). We

288

290

lambda light chain (encoded by IGKC and IGLC2, Supplementary Figure 6B). Using the ratio

291

of IGKC and IGLC2 (see Methods for details), we found benign B cells in C1, lambda-restricted

292

malignant B cells in C2, and malignant B cells with only marginal expression of IGKC and

293

IGLC2 in C3 to C5 (Supplementary Figure 6C). The pattern of light chain expression could be

294

perfectly comprehended using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure 6D), enabling us to

295

differentiate C1 versus C2 versus C3, C4 and C5. Cluster C3 could then be recognized by a

296

high expression of CD44 (Supplementary Figure 6D, 6E). To further distinguish C4 and C5

297

among the CD44Low cells, we combined CD22, CD27 and CD24 and detected a subpopulation

298

with CD22High, CD27High and CD24Low, which corresponded to the expression pattern of cluster

299

C5 (Supplementary Figure 6F). This approach allowed us to proof all five scRNA-based

300

clusters by flow cytometry with comparable frequencies.

301

To assess subclone-specific drug response, we stained for kappa and lambda light chains and

302

focused on the two major populations (C2 ≙ lambda+, C3-C5 ≙ kappa/lambda-). We did not

303

observe differential responses for the majority of targeted drugs, but we found that only the

304

kappa/lambda- cluster was sensitive to chemotherapeutics (Supplementary Figure 6G).

305

Interestingly, this patient received doxorubicin-based immunochemotherapy as first line

306

treatment after sample collection and achieved only a partial remission.

307
308

The indolent and aggressive component of transformed follicular lymphoma exhibit a

309

distinct transcriptional, genomic and drug response profile

310

For the tFL1 sample, we detected three transcriptionally distinct clusters of B cells based on

311

single cell RNA expression profiling (Figure 5A, B). Two clusters exclusively contained

312

malignant B cells, and one cluster contained non-malignant B cells. We assessed the

313

proliferative activity of both malignant populations based on their gene expression profiles, and

314

observed that only one malignant cluster contained cells in S phase (Supplementary Figure 7A),

315

with no cells in G2 or M phase (Supplementary Figure 7B). This suggests that this cluster

316

represents a proliferating, thus aggressive component of the transformed FL. We performed a

317

GSEA on the mean expression differences between the two malignant clusters, which revealed

318

that gene expression signatures associated with MYC, MTORC1, and the G2M transition [46]

319

were significantly enriched in the presumptively aggressive malignant B cell subclone

320

(Supplementary Figure 7D-F).

321

Among the genes differentially expressed between both subclones, we found FCGR2B (Figure

322

5A), which encodes a surface receptor protein (CD32B), to be exclusively expressed in the

323

presumptively indolent subclone. Thus, we confirmed the existence of three B cell populations

324

by flow cytometry (Figure 5C, see Supplementary Figure 8A for complete gating strategy).

325

CD10 was strongly positive in both malignant B cell populations (CD32High, CD32Low), but not

326

in non-malignant B cells.

327

As described above, we measured the ex vivo drug responses separately for each subclone

328

(Figure 5D, E) and observed very different drug response profiles for the two malignant

329

subclones. The BTK inhibitors, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and tirabrutinib, and the

330

immunomodulatory imide drugs (pomalidomide, lenalidomide), were exclusively active in the

331

CD32Low subclone, whereas HDAC inhibitors (panobinostat, romidepsin, vorinostat) were

332

more active in the CD32High subclone.

333

Based on CD32 and CD10 expression, we sorted the three B cell subclones by flow cytometry

334

(Supplementary Figure 8A) and performed WES of peripheral blood-derived normal control

335

DNA, whole tumor DNA, DNA of both malignant subclones, and DNA of the non-malignant

336

B cell population. Copy number profiles of both malignant subclones were very different,

337

including exclusive aberrations of chromosomes 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 15, 18 and X (Supplementary

338

Figure 7F). Only the CD32Low subclone harbored a trisomy 12 (Figure 5F), which was

339

confirmed by scRNA-seq data (Figure 5G). Trisomy 12 has been associated with a better

340

response to B cell receptor (BCR) signaling inhibitors [47], which was consistent with our

341

observation that this subclone was more responsive to these drugs (Figure 5D, E). We also

342

detected 157 somatic single nucleotide variants (SNV) in exonic regions, of which 25 (15.9 %)

343

or 24 (15. 2%) were exclusively detected in the CD32High or CD32Low subclone, respectively

344

(Figure 5H, I, Supplementary Table 6). However, the majority of somatic SNVs were equally

345

represented in both subclones, indicating a phylogenetic relationship. We compared the allele

346

count of all exonic SNVs between all three B cell populations and did not detect somatic SNV

347

in healthy B cells (Figure 5J), which supports the validity of our sorting approach.

348

Taken together, scRNA-seq allowed us to identify different subclones within the same lymph

349

node, which were genetically and functionally distinct in clinically-relevant aspects.

351

A subclone-specific copy number variation of MYC drives a distinct gene expression and

353

The DLBCL1 sample was collected from a patient with a chemotherapy refractory disease

354

during progression, but before retreatment. Using scRNA-seq, we identified two distinct

355

clusters of malignant B cells, which exhibited a high number of differentially expressed genes

356

associated with diverse cellular programs (Figure 6A, B), such as BCR signaling (PRKCB,

357

NFKB1I), cytokine signaling (LGALS9, IFITM1), MAPK signaling (RGS13, FBLN5) and

358

antigen processing (PTPN22, SELL, CD48). Among the differentially expressed genes, we

359

found CD48 and SELL (Supplementary Figure 9A, B), which encode for the surface markers

360

CD48 and CD62L respectively. Staining for CD48 and CD62L by flow cytometry validated the

361

existence of the two distinct subclones (Figure 6C). The proportions of both clusters

362

(CD48HighCD62L+, CD48LowCD62L-) calculated based on flow cytometry and scRNA-seq were

363

comparable, indicating good concordance between RNA and protein expression. We measured

364

again the ex vivo drug responses for each subclone (Figure 6D, E) and observed a strikingly

365

different drug response profile between the two subclones: B cell receptor (BCR) signaling

366

inhibitors (acalabrutinib, tirabrutinib, ibutinib, duvelisib, idelalisib, entospletinib) and CDK

367

inhibitors were exclusively effective in the CD48LowCD62L- subclone, whereas Bromodomain

368

and Extra-Terminal motif (BET) inhibitors (I-BET-762, OTX015), nucleoside analogues

369

(cytarabine, fludarabine, cladribine) and vincristine were exclusively efficacious in the

370

CD48HighCD62L+ subclone.

371

We sorted viable tumor cells based on surface markers (CD48, CD62L, Supplementary Figure

372

8B) and performed WGS on each subclone separately, as well as on the whole tumor sample.

373

In total, we detected 240 non-synonymous SNV located in exonic regions (Supplementary

374

Table 7), however, only 1 (0.4 %) or 5 (2.1 %) SNV were exclusively detected in the

375

CD48LowCD62L- or the CD48HighCD62L+ cluster, respectively (Figure 6F). We further

376

compared CNV profiles of the two subclones and detected a number of differences: the

377

CD48HighCD62L+ cluster carried an additional copy of MYC (8q24, Figure 6G), which was

378

reflected by increased MYC expression levels (Supplementary Figure 9C). The q arm of

379

chromosome 14 harbored two copy number gains and one copy number loss in the

380

CD48HighCD62L+ cluster (Figure 6G). Moreover, chromosome X exhibited a copy number gain

381

of the p arm in the CD48HighCD62L+ cluster, and a copy number loss of the q arm in the

382

CD48LowCD62L- cluster (Figure 6G).

383

Since pathologic activation of MYC renders cells sensitive to BET inhibitors [48, 49], we

384

performed intracellular flow cytometry-based staining of MYC at baseline and after 24 hours

385

incubation with and without the two BET inhibitors, I-BET-762 or OTX015. We confirmed the

386

increased MYC expression level of the CD48HighCD62L+ subclone at baseline (Figure 6H,

387

Supplementary Figure 9D), and, as expected, found that MYC was downregulated upon

388

incubation with I-BET-762 and OTX015, but not upon incubation with the BTK inhibitor

389

ibrutinib (Figure 6H, Supplementary Figure 9E-G).

391

In vivo retreatment confirms ex vivo prediction of subpopulation-specific drug response

392

To exemplify the translational relevance of subclone-specific drug responses, we performed

393

WES of DLBCL1 during the second relapse after retreatment with high-dose cytarabine. Based

394

on ex vivo drug perturbation we had predicted that the CD48HighCD62L+ but not the

395

CD48LowCD62L- subpopulation would respond to cytarabine (Figure 6D). We compared

396

several synonymous SNV exclusive to the CD48HighCD62L+ subpopulation before retreatment

397

and during second relapse, and observed that the cytarabine-sensitive subpopulation was

398

successfully eradicated (Figure 6I). Due to the lack of sufficiently exclusive SNV in the

399

resistant subclone, we took advantage of the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome Xq

400

(Figure 6G) to determine the aberrant fraction of cells harboring a loss of Xq before and after

401

retreatment. We found that the fraction of chemotherapy-resistant cells, harboring the loss of

402

Xq, increased from 72 % to 93 % (see methods section for details).

403

In summary, we dissected the intratumor heterogeneity of the DLBCL1 sample on the

404

transcriptional, genomic, and drug response level. This clinically relevant example highlights

405

the huge translational relevance of tumor subpopulations and their specific drug response

406

profile for personalized cancer treatment.

407

Discussion

408

Intratumor heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for the clinical management of cancer

409

patients. Advances of single cell technologies facilitated the profiling of intratumor

410

heterogeneity at an unprecedented resolution [50]. Most of these studies comprehensively

411

describe intratumor heterogeneity on the transcriptional level, but do not explore its functional

412

consequences such as response or resistance to drugs. In this study, we address this limitation

413

and identify transcriptionally distinct malignant subclones in B-NHL lymph node biopsies. We

414

study differential drug response patterns of these subclones and genetic events which likely

415

drove these differences.

416

Our analysis revealed the coexistence of up to four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of

417

malignant cells within individual B-NHL lymph node samples. This result recapitulates similar

418

observations in follicular lymphoma [45], multiple myeloma [51] and other cancer entities [8,

419

12, 52]. We and others attributed this heterogeneity to differentially enriched gene sets, which

420

indicate, for instance, activity of MYC, proliferation, or germinal center experience. However,

421

we went further and established a straightforward strategy to prove the coexistence of up to four

422

different tumor subpopulations at the cellular level. We subsequently performed perturbation

423

assays with a comprehensive panel of clinically relevant drugs and observed that tumor

424

subclones within the same lymph node responded strikingly different both to targeted

425

compounds, such as ibrutinib, but also chemotherapeutics. The study by de Boer and colleagues

426

supports our observation by demonstrating that acute myeloid leukemia subclones, which were

427

identified on the basis of 50 leukemia-enriched plasma membrane proteins, had distinct

428

functional properties including a differential sensitivity to FLT3-inhibition driven by a

429

subclonal FLT3-ITD mutation [53]. Most preclinical in vitro and in vivo drug screens do not

430

address such clonal heterogeneity, which may explain the failure of numerous drug candidates

431

in the clinic [47]. For a single patient, we even demonstrated that the ex vivo drug response

432

profiling correctly predicted the treatment sensitivity of tumor subclones in vivo. The

433

prospective identification of rational combinations of cancer drugs that effectively target co-

434

existing tumor subclones separately could avoid the outgrowth of resistant tumor clones under

435

therapeutic pressure of a single drug, and would thereby improve efficacy of cancer treatments.

436

Our study addresses this limitation of many ex vivo drug perturbation studies, and, due to its

437

unbiased approach to prospectively dissect the malignant substructure, it is also generalizable

438

to other cancer entities. However, due to the limitation of lymph node derived primary cells,

439

we have to acknowledge that we could not apply our approach to all samples. Further studies

440

are necessary to expand this approach and to address also spatial heterogeneity of malignant

441

tumors.

442

Our approach enabled us to directly identify genetic factors that underlie the transcriptional and

443

drug response differences between subclones. This distinguishes our work from a previous

444

scRNA-seq study in FL, which indirectly compared allele frequencies of bulk WES with the

445

size of transcriptionally distinct subclones [45]. The authors found a correlation between

446

genomic alterations and subclonal fractions and concluded that somatic mutations are

447

associated with transcriptional differences. These findings are in contrast to another study,

448

which correlated subclusters derived from targeted single cell expression profiling of 91 genes

449

with subclusters derived from single cell immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH) sequencing. In

450

this study, the authors concluded that distinct gene expression clusters were not associated with

451

subclones derived from IGH hypermutations [54]. While these studies provide only indirect

452

evidence, we physically sorted tumor subclones and normal B cells, and performed WGS or

453

WES separately for transcriptionally distinct lymphoma subpopulations. With regard to somatic

454

mutations, we observed two different scenarios: in the DLBCL1 sample we identified almost

455

no somatic SNVs to be exclusive for one or the other subclone, whereas in the tFL1 sample we

456

found up to 15% exclusive somatic SNVs in each subclone. However, both examples represent

457

scenarios where subclone specific drug profiles could not have been predicted by means of gene

458

mutation sequencing. We further compared CNV profiles of the same tumor subclones, and

459

found that all subclones harbored significantly different CNV profiles, suggesting that copy

460

number alterations represent an important layer of genetic events which can drive differential

461

gene expression programs and drug response profiles. Although our results support the general

462

notion that genetic events drive subclone specific differences in drug response, they also

463

highlight the difficulty to predict drug responses based on only genome sequencing in clinical

464

practice. It might therefore be beneficial to obtain both genetic- and drug response profiles for

465

personalized treatment decisions.

466

Exploring the heterogeneity of the immune microenvironment in B-NHL has the potential to

467

better reveal how lymphomas shape their microenvironment and how lymphoma patients could

468

be better stratified for the treatment with immunotherapies. T cells represented the largest non-

469

malignant population in B NHL lymph node biopsies. We identified four major,

470

transcriptionally distinct T cell subpopulations, which were annotated as cytotoxic T cells,

471

regulatory T helper cells, conventional T helper cells and T follicular helper cells [29-33]. We

472

measured the frequency of these T cell subsets in an extended cohort of malignant lymph node

473

biopsies and found T follicular helper cells to be enriched in FL, which is in line with previous

474

flow cytometry-based studies [33, 55]. These T cell subsets displayed only limited

475

transcriptional heterogeneity with less variability between lymph nodes compared to malignant

476

cells. However, the frequencies of these T cell subsets varied significantly across donors, which

477

suggests that B-NHL shape their microenvironment by regulating the recruitment of different

478

T cell subsets. This observation might be of clinical relevance, because cold tumors with very

479

few infiltrating T cells have been reported to respond less well to immunotherapies [56].

480

Despite the rather small number of analyzed B-NHL patients, our study is of high clinical

481

relevance. We demonstrated that the prospective identification of pre-existing transcriptionally

482

distinct malignant subclones might be of diagnostic value to detect difficult to treat tumor

483

subclones. In addition, our research establishes scRNA-seq as a new key technology for precise

484

molecular profiling of relapsed and refractory nodal B cell lymphomas, and facilitates the

485

design of new and molecularly-informed diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Patients samples and lymph node procession

488

Our study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Heidelberg. Informed

489

consent was obtained in advance. Immediately after the excision, the lymph node was cut in

490

small pieces and put into Roswell Park Memorial Institute (Gibco) medium supplemented with

491

10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco) at a final

492

concentration of 100 U/ml and 100 µg/ml and L-Glutamine (Gibco) at a final concentration of

493

2 mM. After filtering by a 40 µm strainer, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered

494

saline (PBS, Gibco and put into RPMI medium (Gibco) medium supplemented with 20 % FBS

(Gibco) and 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Serva), and then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen

496

until further analysis. an

Quantification of immunohistochemical staining

499

Formalin fixed lymph node tissue were processed through the hospital’s routine

500

immunohistochemistry pipeline and thereby stained for CD3, PAX5 and Ki67 (all Ventana).

501

After completion of diagnostics, the corresponding slides were scanned for a subset of patients

502

(n = 7). To quantify the frequencies of B and T cells, the open source software QuPath (v0.1.2)

503

was used for PAX5 or CD3 stained slides according to the recommended workflow [57]. After

504

detection of about 100.000 cells per slide, the measurements were exported and further analyzed

505

using R. We visualized the intracellular signal of diaminobenzidine staining of all detected

506

events in a histogram. For the staining of PAX5 and CD3 we observed two clear peaks for all

507

samples and set a threshold in between. Cells with an intracellular signal of CD3 or PAX5

508

greater than this threshold were regarded as T cells or B cells, respectively. The proportion of

509

Ki67+ cells was obtained from routine pathology reports.

510
511

Surface and intracellular staining by flow cytometry

512

As described above, lymph node derived cells were thawed and stained for viability using a

513

fixable viability dye e506 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and for different surface markers

514

depending on the experimental setup. The following surface antibodies were used: anti-CD3-

515

PerCP/Cy5.5, anti-CD3-APC, anti-CD19-BV421, anti-kappa-PE, anti-kappa-FITC, anti-

516

lambda-PE/Dazzle, anti-CD22-APC, anti-CD24-BV785, anti-CD27-PE-Cy7, anti-CD32-PE,

519

subsequent intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with the intracellular

520

fixation/permeabilization buffer set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stained with anti-MYC-

521

AF647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-FoxP3-AF647 (BD Biosciences), or adequate isotype

522

controls (Thermo Fisher Scientific, BD Biosciences). Cells were then analyzed with an LSR

523

Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and FACSDiva (BD Biosciences, Version 8)

524
525

Estimating the proportion of malignant and non-malignant B cells by flow cytometry

526

Staining for expression of the light chains (kappa, lambda) is a well-established tool to identify

527

the accumulation of light chain restricted, malignant B cells [58]. Lymph node derived cells

528

were stained as described above. In case of a kappa+ or lambda+ B cell population greater than

529

80 %, we regarded this population as light chain restricted and therefore as malignant. We

530

further assumed that the ratio of kappa+ versus lambda+ B cells among the potentially remaining

531

non-malignant B cells is still balanced. Therefore, there must be roughly the same proportion

532

of non-malignant B cells among those carrying the restricted type of light chain. This ends up

533

in the following formula to estimate the proportion of malignant cells:

534

Proportion)*+,,-_/0,123034 ≈ Proportion)*+,,-_7+-471*4+8 − Proportion)*+,,-_3:4.7+-471*4+8

535

In addition, cells without detectable expression of kappa or lambda light chain on protein level

536

were regarded as malignant cells because a loss of light chain expression is not observed in

537

non-malignant lymph nodes [59].

538
539

Single cell sample preparation and RNA sequencing

540

After thawing, cells were washed to remove DMSO as quickly as possible. We used the dead

541

cell removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec) for all samples to achieve a viability of at least 90%. The

542

preparation of the single cell suspensions, synthesis of cDNA and single cell libraries were

543

performed using the Chromium single cell v2 3’ kit (10x Genomics) according to the

544

manufacturer's instructions. Each was sequenced on one NextSeq 550 lane (Illumina).

546

Subclone specific drug screening

547

58 different drugs at 5 different concentrations (Supplementary Table 5) and a suitable number

548

of DMSO controls were prepared in 384 well plates. DMSO concentration was kept equally at

549

0.2 % in all wells. Lymph node cells were thawed in a 37°C water bath and DMSO containing

550

freezing medium was removed as quickly as possible to reduce cytotoxic effects. Afterwards,

551

lymph node cells were rolled for 3 hours in RPMI medium supplemented with penicillin and

streptomycin (Gibco) at a final concentration of 100 U/ml and 100 µg/ml, L-glutamine (Gibco)

553

at a final concentration of 2 mM and with 10 % human AB male serum (Sigma). Cells were

554

seeded at a cell count of 50,000 in 50 µl per well. After 48 hours, cells were washed once with

555

staining buffer [PBS (Gibco) supplemented with 1% FBS and 0.5 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic

556

acid (EDTA, Sigma Aldrich)]. Cells were subsequently stained with fixable viability dye e506

557

(Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-CD3-APC, anti-CD19-BV421 and anti-CD48-PE, anti-

558

CD62L-PE/Cy7 or anti-kappa-FITC, anti-lambda-PE/Dazzle, anti-CD10-APC/Cy7, anti-

559

CD27-PE/Cy7, anti-CD32-PE (all Biolegend). After staining the microtiter plate was washed

560

twice with staining buffer. Then, cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde at a final

561

concentration of 2 % for 15 min at room temperature and washed with staining buffer. Fixed

562

cells were analyzed with an LSR II and FACSDiva (BD Biosciences, Version 8) equipped with

563

a high throughput sampler (HTS) system (BD Biosciences). Approximately 5,000 to 10,000

564

events were recorded per well. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree

Star). The gating strategy is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 8. We ruled out that significant

566

up- or downregulation of subclone-discriminating surface antigens confound subclone-specific

567

drug response assessment by evaluating the fluorescence intensity of corresponding markers

568

before and after drug treatment (Supplementary Figure 10).

569
570

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of B cell subclones

571

Lymph node cells were stained as described above. Sorting was performed at a FACS Aria

572

Fusion (BD Biosciences). We sorted either for e506– CD3– CD19+ CD48– CD62L– and e506–

573

CD3– CD19+ CD48– CD62L– (DLBCL1) or for e506– CD3– CD19+CD10–, e506– CD3– CD19+

574

CD10+ kappa+, CD32low and e506– CD3– CD19+ CD10+ kappa+, CD32high cells (tFL). The gating

575

strategy is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 8. All relevant fractions were analyzed post-

576

sorting to confirm a purity of at least 95 %.

577
578

Whole genome and whole exome sequencing

579

DNA was extracted using the DNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers

580

protocol, followed by quality control using gel electrophoresis and a TapeStation 2200 system

581

(Agilent). Samples were prepared either for WGS or WES, as previously described [60]. Exome

582

capturing was performed using SureSelect Human All Exon V5 in-solution capture reagents

583

(Agilent). If samples were destined for WES on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument, then 1.5

584

µg genomic DNA were fragmented to 150 to 200 bp insert size with a Covaris S2 device, and

585

250 ng of Illumina adapter-containing libraries were hybridized with exome baits at 65°C for

586

16 hours. If samples were destined for WES on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument, then 200

587

ng genomic DNA were fragmented to 300 bp insert size with a Covaris LE220 or E220 device,

588

and 750 ng of adapter-containing libraries were hybridized with exome baits at 65°C for 16

589

hours. If samples were destined for WGS on an Illumina HiSeq X instrument, then 100 ng of

590

genomic DNA were fragmented to 450 bp insert size with a Covaris LE220 or E220 device,

591

and libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Nano Kit (Illumina). On all platforms paired-end

592

sequencing was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations, yielding read

593

lengths of 101 bp (4000) or 151 bp (HiSeq X).

594
595

Single cell RNA sequencing data processing

596

The Cell Ranger analysis pipeline (v2.1, 10x Genomics) was used to demultiplex the raw base

597

call files and to convert them into FASTQ files. FASTQ files were aligned to the reference

598

genome (hg38) and filtered. Final numbers of cell barcodes, unique molecular identifiers (UMI)

599

per cell, median genes and sequencing saturation are summarized in Supplementary Table 8.

600
601

Filtering and normalizing single cell RNA sequencing data

602

The R package Seurat [61] (v2.3.3) was used to perform quality control and normalization.

603

Gene count per cell, UMI count per cell and the percentage of mitochondrial and ribosomal

604

transcripts were computed using the functions of the Seurat package. Genes expressed in three

605

cells or fewer were excluded from downstream analysis. Libraries with a percentage of

606

mitochondrial transcripts greater than 5%, along with those with less than 200 genes were

607

filtered out prior to further analysis. Since aggressive lymphomas displayed higher gene and

608

UMI count, the upper limit was set with regard to each sample. Counts were adjusted for cell-

609

specific sampling (“normalized”) using the LogNormalize function with the default scale factor

610

of 10,000.

611
612

Assessing the cell cycle state using scRNA-seq data

613

The cell cycle state was assessed using the gene set and scoring system, described by Tirosh

614

and colleagues [8]. Briefly, the S-Score and the G2M-Score were calculated based on a list of

615

43 S phase-specific and 54 G2 or M phase-specific genes. The calculation of the actual scores

616

was performed using the CellCycleScoring function of the Seurat R package.

618

Analysis of ligand-receptor interactions in scRNA-Seq data

619

We used the CellPhoneDB database [37] as basis for potential cell-cell interactions, but

620

expanded the list by important B to T cell interactions (Supplementary Table 4). To assess the

621

significance of each interaction, we adapted a statistical framework recently described by

622

Vento-Tormo and colleagues [37] to our purpose. Importantly, we considered only genes which

623

were expressed in 5 % of at least one cell type.

624

Briefly, we performed pairwise comparisons between the different T and B cell subtypes for

625

each ligand-receptor pair and sample. For each combination of two different cell types and each

626

ligand-receptor-pair, we permuted the cluster labels of cells at least 1,000 times and determined

627

the mean interaction score (mean expression of ligand in cell type A times mean expression of

628

receptor in cell type B). A p value was determined by calculating the proportion of permuted

629

interaction scores which were by hazard higher than the actual interaction score. All interactions

630

were calculated sample-wise. To determine which interactions were most relevant across

631

different samples, we calculated the mean interaction scores and combined the different p

632

values using the Fisher’s method. Then, p values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg

633

method. The R code is available on our GitHub repository (see code availability statement

634

below).

635
636

Combining data from different samples and batch correction

637

After identification of the different cell types the data sets were split into non-B cells or B cells

638

using the SubsetData function. Then the respective subsets were combined using the

639

MergeSeurat function. Putative batch effects between two runs, were corrected by the mutual

640

nearest neighbors (MNN) technique [62] which is implemented in the scran Bioconductor

641

package (v1.10.2).

642
643

Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques

644

SNN (Shared-nearest neighbor)-based clustering, t-SNE and UMAP visualization were

645

performed using the FindClusters, RunTSNE and RunUMAP functions within the Seurat

646

package [61]. Each of these were performed on the basis of a principal component analysis

647

which was performed using the RunPCA function of the Seurat package. The same parameters

648

were applied to all samples. UMAP was used instead of t-SNE for combined data sets because

649

it is significantly faster than t-SNE and better preserves aspects of global structure in larger data

650

sets [28]. Differentially expressed genes between the clusters were identified using the

651

FindMarkers or FindAllMarkers functions within the Seurat package [61]. Differentially

expressed genes between malignant B cell clusters can be browsed interactively using an html

653

654
655

Gene set enrichment analysis

656

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the GSEA java desktop application

657

[63, 64] and the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, v6.2) provided by the Broad Institute

658

[63, 65]. Differentially expressed genes of two groups were used to determine significantly-

659

enriched gene sets.

660
661

WES and WGS data processing

662

Alignment of sequencing read pairs and variant calling were performed as recently described

663

[66]. Briefly, reads were mapped to human reference genome (hg19) with bwa-mem (version

664

0.7.8, minimum base quality threshold set to zero [-T 0], remaining settings left to default) [67].

665

Subsequently, reads were coordinate-sorted with bamsort (compression option set to fast) and

666

duplicate read pairs were marked with bammarkduplicates (compression option set to best)

667

(both part of biobambam package version 0.0.148).

668

SNV and indels in matched tumor normal pairs were identified using the internal DKFZ variant

669

calling workflows based on samtools/bcftools 0.1.19 with additional custom filters (optimized

670

for somatic variant calling by deactivating the pval-threshold in bcftools) and Platypus 0.8.1,

671

respectively, as described previously [66]. Gene annotation of variants was done with

672

Annovar [68]. The variants were annotated with dbSNP141, 1000 Genomes (phase 1), Gencode

673

mapability track, UCSC High Seq Depth track, UCSC Simple-Tandem repeats, UCSC Repeat-

674

Masker, DUKE-Excluded, DAC-Blacklist, UCSC Selfchain. These annotation tracks were used

675

to determine a confidence score for each variant by a heuristic punishment scheme and only

676

high confidence variants were kept for further analysis. In addition, variants with strong read

677

biases according to the strand bias filter were removed.

678

Genomic structural rearrangements (SVs) were identified using the SOPHIA algorithm

679

(unpublished, source code available at https://bitbucket.org/utoprak/sophia/). Briefly,

680

supplementary alignments as produced by bwa-mem are used as indicators of potential

681

underlying SVs. Candidates are filtered by comparing them to a background control set of

682

sequencing data obtained using normal blood samples from a background population database

683

of 3261 patients from published TCGA and ICGC studies as well as published and unpublished

684

studies of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ).

685

Allele-specific CNV were detected using ACEseq (allele-specific copy number estimation from

686

WGS) [69] for WGS data and CNVkit for WES data [70]. ACEseq determines absolute allele-

687

specific copy numbers as well as tumor ploidy and tumor cell content based on coverage ratios

688

of tumor and control as well as the B-allele frequency (BAF) of heterozygous single-nucleotide

689

polymorphisms (SNPs). SVs called by SOPHIA were incorporated to improve genome

690

segmentation.

691
692

Multi tumor comparison

693

To compare multi tumor samples of the same donor, every SNV position in each sample was

694

determined using samtools mpileup 1.6. At each of these SNV positions, the variant allele

695

fraction was determined by calculating the ratio between the number of variant reads and the

696

total coverage at that position. To correct the variant allele fraction for actual tumor cell content,

697

a scaling factor was incorporated, comprising ploidy and total copy number (TCN) estimates

698

obtained from ACEseq/CNVkit. Specifically, the scaling factor is obtained as the ratio between

699

purity corrected number of alleles in the tumor (TCN_tumor purity_tumor) and purity corrected

700

total number of alleles in the sample ((TCN_tumor * purity_tumor) + 2 * (1 - purity_tumor)).

701
702

Aberrant cell fraction estimation from LOH

703

To determine aberrant cell fractions, the minor allele-frequency (MAF, ratio between number

704

of reads of minor allele and total coverage at given position) of single nucleotide polymorphism

705

(SNP) was estimated for selected regions harboring a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or a copy

706

number neutral LOH (CN-LOH) in the tumor sample. Information on SNP location was

707

received from matched-control SNV calling. To select heterozygous SNP, only SNP with a

708

MAF ≥ 0.3 in the control were retained. Subsequently, MAF values of the selected SNP were

709

calculated for the tumor samples. For exome samples, only SNP within the targeted capture

710

regions were kept. The mean of the respective tumor MAF values was calculated and the

711

aberrant cell fraction (ACF) was estimated as follows:

712

<=>?@A = 1 − 2 ∙ FGHI (K<> ) ; <=>NOP?@A =

1 − 2 ∙ FGHI (K<>)
1 − FGHI (K<>)

Figure 1. Identification of cell types using scRNA-seq.
A) Schematic overview of the study design. B and C) Lymph node-derived B and T cells were quantified by
scRNA-seq, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of paraffin tissue sections (see Supplementary
Figure 1 for details). The frequencies of B and T cells were correlated for B) scRNA-seq and flow cytometry or
C) scRNA-seq and IHC. Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) and the number of samples included (n) are given
in the left top corner. D and E) Illustration of the strategy to identify malignant B cells. Single cell RNA
expression profiles of B cells derived from the tFL1 sample were visualized by t-SNE. The different B cell
clusters are circled and labeled with hB (healthy B cells), B1 (B cell cluster 1) and B2 (B cell cluster 2). For
each single B cell we calculated the the kappa light chain (IGKC) fraction IGKC/(IGKC+IGLC2) (see color
code D and E). If this IGKC-fraction was > 0.5, we classified a B cell as a kappa positive and if this ratio was
below 0.5 we classified the B cell as a lambda positive. The percentage of B cells either expressing kappa or
lambda per transcriptionally distinct B cell cluster was calculated. The non-malignant healthy B cell (hB) cluster
contained approximately 50% kappa and 50% lambda expressing B cells while the tow malignant cluster (B1,
B2) contained B cells homogeneously expressing the kappa light chain.

identified in this sample. E and F) Single cell suspensions of lymph nodes derived from 39 different patients,
including those passed to scRNA-seq, were characterized by flow cytometry. The four different T cell
populations identified by single cell RNA-Seq were distinguished using the following marker panel: CD3, CD4,
CD8, PD1, ICOS and FoxP3. Specifically, TH were identified based on CD3+CD4+ without the phenotype of
TFH or TREG; TTOX were identified based on CD3+CD8+; TFH were identified based on CD3+CD4+
ICOSHighPD1High; and TREG were identified based on CD3+CD4+FoxP3+. E) The frequencies based on flow
cytometry were correlated with the frequencies based on scRNA-seq. Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) and
the number of samples included (n) are given in the top left corner. Note that the DLBCL1 and tFL2 samples are
not shown here due to the low number of T cells in the scRNA-seq data (DLBCL1) or the lack of material
(tFL2). F) Frequencies for each subpopulation with regard to the sum of all T cells are shown. P values were
calculated by the two-sided Wilcoxon’s test comparing each Entity with rLN group, and corrected by
Bonferroni method. Only significant differences are shown; ** ≙ p value £ 0.01, * ≙ p value £ 0.05. SNN:

Figure 3. Gene expression signatures driving B cell heterogeneity.
A and B) Single cell RNA expression profiles from all B cells were combined and jointly visualized using
UMAP. Cells are colored either by SNN-based clusters (A) or by sample (B). C) A gene set enrichment analysis
was performed separately for each malignant cluster (C3 to C9) versus all healthy B cells (C0, C1). The four
most enriched gene sets per sample are shown. Columns refer to cluster. Circles are coded by color (nominal
FDR) and size (NES). Gene sets with NES > 1.5 are shown. D) Cells in UMAP plot were colored by the mean
expression of enriched genes for four representative gene expression signatures. UMAP: Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection. SNN: Shared-nearest-neighbor. FDR: False-positive detection rate. NES:

Figure 4. Cellular crosstalk in B cell lymphoma within the lymph node microenvironment.
Overview of most significant ligand-receptor interactions across all lymphoma samples, excluding DLBCL1
due to the low number of T cells. Circle size indicates negative log10 of adjusted p values which were
determined by permutation test (see Methods for details). Color scheme visualizes interaction scores which were
calculated by the mean expression of molecule 1 (blue) in cell type A (blue) and the mean expression of
molecule 2 (black) in cell type B (black). Protein names instead of gene names were used for TACI
(TNFRSF13B), BAFF-R (TNFRSF13C), BCMA (TNFRSF17) and BAFF (TNFSF13B).

Figure 5. In depth-analysis of sample tFL1
A-B) Single cell RNA expression profiles of B cells derived from the tFL sample were subjected to SNN-based
clustering. Three transcriptionally distinct clusters emerged. A) The heatmap illustrates the top 30 differentially
expressed genes between all three identified clusters. Gene expression values were scaled to the maximum of
each row. B) Clusters were colored and visualized in t-SNE projections of scRNA-seq expression profiles of
malignant B cells. C) tFL1 derived lymph node cells were stained for viability, CD19, CD32, and CD10. The
gates highlight three CD19+ populations which correspond to the subclusters shown in panel B. D and E)
Unsorted single cell suspensions from the tFL sample were incubated for 48 hours with 58 different drugs and
five concentrations, and stained as described in panel C. Viability was normalized to vehicle control for each
subpopulation separately. D) The mean difference of viabilities between the two malignant subclones is shown.
White indicates that both malignant clones responded equally to this drug. Purple or green indicates that the
viability of the CD32High or CD32Low subpopulation was superior. E) Six representative subclone specific
responses to the following drugs are shown: panobinostat, vorinostat, romidepsin (HDAC inhibitors),
acalabrutinib (BCR signaling inhibitor), lenalidomide and pomalidomide (immunomodulatory imide drugs). F)
Whole exome sequencing was performed on FACS sorted CD32High-, CD32Low- and the non-malignant CD10- B
cell subset. The line plot shows the total copy number estimation for chromosome 12 for all three sorted
populations. The CD32Low clone harbors an additional copy of chromosome 12. G) Density curves of single cell
expression values for all genes located on chromosome 12 are shown for each subclone. H-J) The scatter plots
show the allele frequency (AF) of the mutated allele for exonic SNVs in both malignant subclones (H), in
CD32Low versus healthy B cells (I) and in CD32High versus healthy B cells (J). Shaded purple or green boxes
highlight SNV that are exclusive to one of the malignant B cell subclones. Red dots mark immunoglobulinassociated mutations. SNN: Shared-nearest-neighbor. HDAC: Histone deacetylase. BCR: B cell receptor. SNV:
Single nucleotide variant.

Figure 6. In depth-analysis of sample DLBCL1
A-B) Single cell RNA expression profiles of malignant B cells derived from the DLBCL1 sample were
subjected to SNN-based clustering. Two transcriptionally distinct clusters emerged. A) Top 40 differentially
expressed genes between the two identified clusters are shown in the heatmap. Gene expression values were
scaled to the maximum of each row. B) Clusters were colored and visualized in t-SNE projections of scRNAseq expression profiles of malignant B cells. C) DLBCL1 derived lymph node cells were stained for viability,
CD19, CD48 and CD62L (=SELL). The gate highlights a population which co-expresses CD62L and CD48,
which represents the identified subclones. D and E) Lymph node derived cells from the DLBCL1 sample were
incubated for 48 hours with 58 different drugs and 5 concentrations. Cells were stained as described in C.
Viability was normalized to DMSO controls for each subpopulation separately. D) Six representative subclonespecific responses to the following drugs are shown: I-BET-762, OTX015 (BET inhibitors), ibrutinib, duvelisib
(BCR signaling inhibitors), cytarabine and cladribine (chemotherapy). E) The mean difference of viabilities
between the two subpopulations is shown. White indicates that both clusters responded equally to this drug.
Purple or green indicates that the viability of the CD48HighCD62L+ or CD48LowCD62L- subpopulation was
superior. F-G) Whole genome sequencing was performed on both FACS sorted populations (CD48HighCD62L+,
CD48LowCD62L-). F) The scatter plot shows the allele frequency (AF) of the mutated allele for nonsynonymous exonic SNV in bold black and synonymous or intronic SNV in faded grey of both subclones.
Shaded purple or green boxes highlight SNV that are exclusive to one or the other subclone. Red dots mark
immunoglobulin-associated non-synonymous exonic mutations. G) Line plots show total copy number
estimations for chromosome 8q24, 14 and X for both clones. H) DLBCL1 derived lymph node cells were
incubated with DMSO control, I-BET-762 at two concentrations (1 µM, 5 µM) or ibrutinib at two
concentrations (0.2 µM, 1 µM). At baseline and after 24 hours cells were harvested and stained for viability,
CD19, CD3, CD48, CD62L and MYC or respective isotype control. Histograms show the fluorescence intensity
of MYC at baseline for T cells, CD48HighCD62L+ and CD48LowCD62L- subclone, after 24 hours incubation with
I-BET-762 and DMSO control or Ibrutinib and DMSO control. I) Shown are SNV with high variant allele
frequencies in the CD48HighCD62L+ subpopulation (purple) and low or undetectable in CD48LowCD62Lsubpopulation (green). Black circles show corresponding variant allele frequencies of whole tumor samples
before and after retreatment with high-dose cytarabine. P value was calculated by the paired Wilcoxon-text.
SNN: Shared-nearest-neighbor. BET: Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal motif protein. BCR: B cell receptor.
SNV: Single nucleotide variant. DMSO: Dimethyl sulfoxide.
