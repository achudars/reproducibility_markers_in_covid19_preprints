ABSTRACT

23

Global population increase coupled with rising urbanization underlies the predicted need for

24

60% more food by 2050, but produced on the same amount of land as today. Improving

25

photosynthetic efficiency is a largely untapped approach to addressing this problem. Here, we

26

scale modeling processes from gene expression through photosynthetic metabolism to predict

27

leaf physiology in evaluating acclimation of photosynthesis to rising [CO2]. Model integration

28

with the yggdrasil interface enabled asynchronous message passing between models. The

29

multiscale model of soybean photosynthesis calibrated to physiological measures at ambient

30

[CO2] successfully predicted the acclimatory changes in the photosynthetic apparatus that

31

were observed at 550 ppm [CO2] in the field. We hypothesized that genetic alteration is

necessary to achieve optimal photosynthetic efficiency under global change. Flux control

33

analysis in the metabolic system under elevated [CO2] identified enzymes requiring the

34

greatest change to adapt optimally to the new conditions. This predicted that Rubisco was less

35

limiting under elevated [CO2] and should be down-regulated allowing re-allocation of

36

resource to enzymes controlling the rate of regeneration of ribulose-1:5 bisphosphate (RubP).

37

By linking the GRN through protein concentration to the metabolic model it was possible to

38

identify transcription factors (TF) that matched the up- and down-regulation of genes needed

39

to improve photosynthesis. Most striking was TF GmGATA2, which down-regulated genes

40

for Rubisco synthesis while up-regulating key genes controlling RubP regeneration and starch

41

synthesis. The changes predicted for this TF most closely matched the physiological ideotype

42

that the modeling predicted as optimal for the future elevated [CO2] world.

INTRODUCTION

47

As the world’s most important seed legume and most widely grown dicotyledonous crop,

48

the future-proofing of photosynthesis in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) under rising

49

atmospheric concentrations of CO2 ([CO2]) is of importance. Down-regulation of light-saturated

50

net leaf CO2 uptake (Asat) at elevated [CO2] has been reported for many C3 crops, yet the

51

mechanism underlying this response is poorly understood. Under current [CO2], Asat in C3 crops

52

is most commonly limited by the in vivo Rubsico activity (Vc,max) (Long et al., 2004). However,

53

as [CO2] continues to rise, it follows from the steady-state biochemical model of photosynthesis

54

of (Farquhar et al., 1980) and its subsequent modifications (Von Caemmerer, 2000) that control

55

will shift from Rubisco to RubP regeneration (Long et al., 2004), which is represented by the

56

maximum in vivo rate of whole chain electron transport (Jmax). While described by electron

57

transport, most evidence now points to this being limited by the metabolic steps of carbon

58

metabolism leading to RubP regeneration (Raines, 2003, Stitt and Sonnewald, 1995). This shift

59

from Rubisco- to RubP- limited photosynthesis permits a reduction in leaf Rubisco content

60

without a loss in Asat (Woodrow, 1994, Long et al., 2004, Ainsworth and Long, 2005). Because

61

Rubisco accounts for the largest single share of leaf N, optimization of Rubisco content would

62

maximize the efficiency of use of this commonly limiting resource (Drake et al., 1997, Long et

63

al., 2004).

64

When [CO2] is increased around a photosynthesizing leaf, Asat can increase for two

65

reasons, first the KM of Rubisco for CO2 is close to the current atmospheric concentration, so

66

elevated [CO2] increases the velocity of carboxylation, and secondly, CO2 competitively inhibits

67

the oxygenation reaction that produces phospho-glycolate and in turn photorespiration. This

68

latter effect is particularly important because it increases the efficiency of net CO2 uptake by

69

diverting ATP and NADPH (generated by the light reactions) away from photorespiratory

70

metabolism to photosynthetic assimilation, and so will increase Asat regardless of other limiting

71

factors. Under rising [CO2] both factors will increase Asat when Vc,max is limiting, but only the

72

second factor when Jmax is limiting. Assuming the average specificity and KM for CO2 and O2

73

for Rubisco from terrestrial plants, and a constant intercellular versus external [CO2], one can

74

calculate the increase in Asat that would result from an increase in atmospheric [CO2]. Following

75

the procedure of (Long et al., 2004) for a leaf temperature of 25 °C, the increase in atmospheric

76

[CO2] from today’s 400 µmol mol-1 to 550 µmol mol-1 would increase Rubisco-limited and

77

RubP-limited photosynthesis by 31% and 9%, respectively. 550 µmol mol-1 is the concentration

78

forecast for 2050 assuming current emissions trends continue (RCP8.5, (Pachauri et al., 2014)).

79

At current atmospheric [CO2] soybean leaf photosynthesis is at the transition point between

80

Vc,max- and Jmax-limitation (Bernacchi et al., 2005). Therefore, as [CO2] rises soybean

81

photosynthesis would become RubP-limited. If however, resource currently invested in Rubisco

82

was re-allocated to increased Jmax then this transition point would move to a higher [CO2] and a

83

31% rather than 9% increase in Asat could be obtained, without any increased total investment of

84

protein in the photosynthetic apparatus. When grown under elevated [CO2] in open-air field

85

conditions, is an increase in Jmax observed at the expense of Vc,max?

86

In two consecutive years, (Bernacchi et al., 2005) analyzed photosynthesis in a modern

87

highly productive soybean cultivar under open-air [CO2] elevation using Free-Air Concentration

88

Enrichment (FACE) (Long et al., 2006). Compared to control plants those grown in [CO2]

89

elevated to 550 µmol mol-1 showed a shift in control of Asat from co-limitation of Vc,max and Jmax

90

to limitation solely by RubP-limitation. There was a significant 5% decrease in the ratio of

91

Vc,max:Jmax, showing a decline in Rubisco activity relative to the capacity for RubP regeneration

92

(Bernacchi et al., 2005).

93

maximize the potential increase in Asat, had the system responded to fully re-optimize investment

94

of resources. At 25 °C, re-optimizing the system to 550 ppm was calculated to require a 35%

95

reduction of investment in Rubisco and re-allocation of that protein to the apparatus for

regeneration of RubP (Drake et al., 1997, Long et al., 2004), while only a 5% change was

However, while acclimation had occurred it was insufficient to

The plant was apparently over-investing in Rubisco and under-investing in the

photosynthetic efficiency and in turn crop productivity under future conditions?

101

Here we combine a metabolic model of C3 photosynthetic metabolism, including the C2

102

photorespiratory pathway, mathematically representing all discrete steps of photosynthesis from

103

light and CO2 absorption to starch and sucrose synthesis (Zhu et al., 2007, Zhu et al., 2013) with

104

a gene network model to predict observed acclimatory changes. This is successfully tested

105

against observed acclimatory changes of photosynthesis in soybean grown at elevated [CO2].

107

model is used to predict genetic changes, including expression levels of transcription factors, that

108

could fully optimize leaf photosynthetic efficiency to future elevated [CO2] conditions.

109

110

MULTISCALE MODEL DEVELOPMENT

111

To predict what genes may transcriptionally regulate the soybean response to elevated

112

[CO2], it was necessary to develop a mechanistically informed model in which the multi-scale

113

response could be explored. We have previously developed complete mechanistic metabolic

114

models of photosynthetic carbon metabolism that successfully predict dynamic responses of leaf

115

chlorophyll fluorescence and fluxes of CO2 and O2 to changes in light, [CO2] and [O2] (Zhu et

116

al., 2007, Zhu et al., 2013). While each of these models provided new insights about

117

photosynthesis, when combined with optimization routines to predict optimal investments for

118

different environments, they are not equipped to predict transcriptomic and genetic changes that

119

could achieve those optimal patterns of investment.

120

metabolism and signaling pathways often results in simulations with low prediction accuracy

121

upon model perturbation. Multiscale models that mimic the biological flow of information across

122

scales have been shown to have higher prediction accuracy than models at individual scales,

123

especially when simulating conditions different from the original training data (Chew et al.,

124

2014). To our knowledge, no current model of photosynthesis in soybean scales from genes to

125

organs. Such a model could potentially simulate system-wide changes in photosynthesis in

126

response to targeted genetic perturbations.

The generalization of whole plant

127

To predict leaf-level responses of net CO2 uptake, a metabolic model (e-Photosynthesis)

128

was combined with a leaf micrometeorological model that integrated boundary layer

129

conductance, stomatal conductance, and leaf energy balance (Drewry et al., 2010, Nikolov et al.,

130

1995). Our prior e-Photosynthesis model (Zhu et al., 2013) simulates fluxes through some 70

131

reactions involved in the light and dark reactions of C3 photosynthesis. The steady-state

132

photosynthesis rate predicted by the e-Photosynthesis model replaced the leaf model prediction

133

that was based on the Farquhar model of photosynthesis (Nikolov et al., 1995). Leaf temperature,

134

light intensity and intercellular CO2 concentration predicted by the leaf model were used as

135

inputs for the e-Photosynthesis model. The integrated leaf metabolic and micrometeorological

136

model effectively simulates the observed response to net leaf CO2 uptake to [CO2] observed for

137

soybean in the field (Bernacchi et al., 2005) (Figure 1, Supplemental figure 1). However, it lacks

138

any capacity to predict the observed decrease in Vc,max and increase in Jmax that resulted from

139

growth in elevated [CO2]. This is because the model lacks any connection to the underlying

140

changes in gene expression that may cause this altered photosynthetic phenotype.

141

The altered photosynthetic phenotype likely resulted from adjusted enzyme

142

concentrations in soybean leaves grown under ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations. Such

143

CO2-induced changes in protein concentrations was shown for total protein concentration in

144

barley, rice, wheat, soybean, and potato (Taub et al., 2007) and for specific proteins via

145

proteomic analysis in rice (Bokhari et al., 2007), wheat (Yousuf et al., 2017), and grape (Zhao et

146

al., 2019). A decrease in the quantity of Rubisco is a pervading feature of plants grown in the

147

field under elevated [CO2] (Ainsworth and Long, 2005). However, the e-Photosynthesis model

148

only allows substrate (CO2) concentration to change, which results in altered reaction rates, but

149

lacks capacity to predict acclimatory changes in enzyme concentrations. By including gene

150

expression data from soybean plants grown under ambient and elevated [CO2] (Leakey et al.,

151

2009), it is possible to make predictions about changes in enzyme concentrations.

152

Gene expression data cannot be used as direct input for the e-Photosynthesis model,

153

which can only accept enzyme concentrations. Also, transcriptome data from microarray or

154

RNA-sequencing technologies provide relative and not absolute quantification of mRNA

155

transcripts. To overcome these challenges and inform the e-Photosynthesis model with gene

156

expression data, a model was needed to computationally translate mRNA to protein

157

concentration. An ordinary differential equation (ODE) was adapted from (Becskei and Serrano,

158

159

2000), and given as: (ࢤ࢖ ൌ

162

upper limit of protein translation. It is assumed that r and p are equal (Edfors et al., 2016), and p

163

is based on starting protein concentration estimates from the e-Photosynthesis model. To

164

simulate steady-state protein concentrations in elevated CO2, p was adjusted based on the

165

proportion of change in mRNA level between ambient and elevated [CO2] for a given gene.

166

The change in predicted, relative protein concentrations between ambient and elevated

167

CO2 conditions (ProteinRatio) was used to adjust the enzyme concentration and activity of each

gene involved in the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis represented in the e-

169

Photosynthesis model, as follows:
Vmax _ ele = Vmax_ 0 ⋅ [ E.ProteinRatio ]

where, Vmax_ele is the maximum activity of each enzyme in elevated CO2, Vmax_0 is the original

172

maximum activity of each enzyme in ambient CO2, and E is the estimated enzyme

173

concentration.

174

Because the protein translation model and metabolic/leaf level models are implemented

175

in different programing languages (Python and MATLAB) respectively, they cannot

176

communicate with each other directly without significant alteration of the model code or through

177

manual integration by running the model programs independently and using files to pass

178

information between them. In order to integrate the models programmatically (Figure 2), we

179

used the yggdrasil framework. yggdrasil is an open-source Python package developed by the

180

Crops in silico research group for connecting models written in different programming languages

181

through simple interfaces in the model’s language of implementation. Based on information on

182

the target models and connections between the models provided in human-readable specification

183

files, yggdrasil runs the designated models in parallel and coordinates asynchronous

184

communication between the models as they run. Asynchronous message passing allows models

185

to continue working after sending output to the next model in the network without waiting for

186

the output to be received, thereby improving the performance of the overall model integration as

187

models can complete calculations simultaneously in separate processes. yggdrasil currently

188

supports connecting models written in Python, Matlab, C and C++ on Linux, Mac OS, and

189

Windows operating systems. Additional information on the yggdrasil package can be found in

190

(Lang, 2019) or in the documentation (https://cropsinsilico.github.io/yggdrasil/).

The soybean transcriptome differential responses to growth in ambient and elevated [CO2] was

197

tissue collected at the beginning of seed set when the canopy has attained full maturity. Probe

198

sets were normalized using the GC Robust Multi-array Average (GCRMA) method. A one-way

199

ANOVA was done in the R statistical software environment using the aov function of the stats

200

package. The reanalysis identified 5005 DEGs on a statistical cutoff of P value <= 0.05 and

201

Benjamini-Hochberg False Discover Rate (FDR) <= 0.3.

202

Construction of CO2 responsive Gene Regulatory Network

203

Co-expression using mutual rank

204

Mutual rank analysis (Obayashi and Kinoshita, 2009) was used to obtain highly significant co-

205

expression relationships among differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In mutual rank analysis,

206

the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is calculated between the gene of interest and all other

207

DEGs, then sorted based on their PCC ranks, in which the gene pair having the highest

208

correlation value is given rank 1 (Obayashi and Kinoshita, 2009). Mutual Rank is calculated

209

from PCC rank by taking the geometric mean between PCC ranks from gene A to gene B and

210

from gene B to gene A, as these can be different. The ranks are scaled between 0 to 1, where MR

211

of 1 indicates the most significant coexpression interaction. All interactions having an MR >=

212

|0.8| and a PCC >= |0.6| were selected for the coexpression network. Interactions having a

213

significant correlation were further filtered to retain only those that had predicted binding

214

interactions between the TF and target gene as described below.

215

Static Gene Regulatory Network construction and analysis

216

To analyze gene regulatory networks, a DNA pattern search algorithm was performed

217

(PlantPAN, http://plantpan2.itps.ncku.edu.tw/) (Medina-Rivera et al., 2015) to identify the

218

presence of known Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the promoter region of genes of interest.

219

Known CREs were obtained from the transcription factor databases Transfac (Matys et al.,

220

2006), JASPAR (Sandelin et al., 2004), CISBP (Weirauch et al., 2014), and PlantTFDB (Jin et

221

al., 2013), and NewPLACE (Higo et al., 1999). The promoter region considered in this study

222

was the sequence 1 Kb upstream of the predicted or experimentally verified Transcription Start

223

Site (TSS) for every gene obtained from PlantProm (Shahmuradov et al., 2003). Promoter

224

regions of target genes were analyzed for an enrichment of CREs for a particular TF family. For

225

this analysis, the average number of binding sites for a CRE in the putative 1 Kb up-stream

226

promoter region of all the genes present in Soybean Wm82.a1.v1 was calculated. If a target gene

227

promoter has a greater than average number of TF family-specific binding sites present in its

228

promoter, then the CRE of interest is considered over-represented.

229

230

Dynamic Gene Regulatory Network Model Construction

231

A dynamic Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) model was built using a linear regression

232

algorithm to infer relationships between a dependent variable (in this case the expression of the

233

putative target gene) and one or more independent variables (or predictors; in this case TFs). The

234

resulting linear model was used to predict the response variable based on the states of the

235

dependent variables. The regression algorithm was run in R using the LM function (Team,

236

2013), which optimizes variables of the linear model using a least squares fit between the

237

response and dependent variables on training data (Eq 1) (Bjorck, 1996).

238

For example:

_

0  1  ்ிଵ  2  ்ிଶ   

Eq 3

239

where, g0, W1, W2 are least squares optimized parameters for the linear model. mRNA_TF1,

240

mRNA_TF2, etc. are expression values of TFs predicted to regulated target genes of interest in

241

the static GRN. Parameters were optimized using training data, which ultimately resulted in a

242

weight (Wx) that corresponds to the level of influence that a TF exerts on a predicted target

243

gene’s expression. A linear model was generated for every gene in the static CO2-responsive

244

GRN, and used to simulate the expression of genes of interest in both ambient and elevated CO2

245

environments. All linear model equations are listed in Supplemental Table 1.

246

The training data was obtained from seven soybean Affymetrix microarray transcriptome

247

datasets (GSE8432, GSE23129, GSE26198, GSE29740, GSE29741, GSE35427, GSE44685).

248

While these datasets were derived from a variety of experimental conditions, they were chosen

249

because samples were taken from similar tissue and developmental stage as those in the CO2-

250

responsive dataset used to build the static GRN (Leakey et al., 2009). Expression data from all

251

training sets were commonly normalized by GCRMA and quality control analysis was

252

performed; samples with a high variation in their median expression level within replicates were

253

removed from the analysis. A total of 213 samples were used to train the linear regression model.

254

The CO2-responsive dataset that is used to build the static GRN was used as a test dataset for the

255

linear model, to predict expression of the target gene using the optimized weight associated with

256

every TF.

257

258

Protein translation model

259

A protein translation model (PTM) adapted from (Becskei and Serrano, 2000) was used to

260

predict steady-state protein concentrations based on relative mRNA transcript levels (See Eq. 1)

261

The model parameter p (and thus r) is obtained from the initial protein concentration used in the

262

e-Photosynthesis metabolic model under the control (ambient CO2 = 380 ppm) condition. To

263

predict initial protein concentration in elevated CO2 conditions (550 ppm), p was adjusted using

264

the relative fold change in mRNA transcript levels measured between ambient and elevated CO2

265

conditions. As stated earlier, L and U are protein synthesis and degradation rates, respectively,

266

and denotes the increase or decrease in protein abundance per hour (denoted as g/L/hour).

267

Soybean gene-specific L and U rates were estimated based on the rates of their Arabidopsis

268

orthologs taken from (Li et al., 2017). If ortholog information for a gene was not available, L and

269

U were estimated by taking an average of L and U rates for all Arabidopsis genes involved in

270

photosynthesis.

271

The PTM model simulations resulted in steady-state protein concentration ratios between

272

ambient and elevated [CO2] conditions for every gene. Optimized parameter ‘d’ was obtained in

273

a gene specific manner such that, the steady-state protein concentration ratio between the two

274

conditions (elevated/ambient) remains constant for that gene after a particular threshold ‘d’ (see

275

Supplemental Table 2). This protein concentration ratio was then used as one of the inputs for the

276

e-Photosynthesis model (described below) in order to account for changes in gene expression as

277

a factor influencing the enzyme kinetics of proteins in the primary C metabolism machinery. The

278

model assumes constant temperature and constant concentration of RNA polymerase (El Samad

279

et al., 2005).

280

Metabolic photosynthesis model

281

The soybean photosynthesis metabolic flux (MF) model is based on the e-Photosynthesis model

282

(Zhu et al., 2013) and implemented in MATLAB. The e-Photosynthesis model is a general C3

283

photosynthesis model that includes each discrete process from light capture to carbohydrate

284

synthesis, including photorespiratory C2 metabolism. In the model, the rate of change of the

285

concentration of each metabolite is represented by an ordinary differential equation (ODE):

Where, [C] represents metabolite concentration; Vp is the total rate of reaction(s) that produces C,

287

and Vu is the rate of consumption. Rate equations for each enzyme catalyzed reaction were

288

developed based on standard Michaelis-Menten equations for enzyme kinetics, with kinetic

289

parameters corresponding to a temperature of 25°C. Four enzymes, including Rubisco, did not

290

satisfy the conditions needed to apply Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and equations for their

291

catalysis were as in (Zhu et al., 2007). Initial protein concentration of enzymes in the MM

292

kinetics equation were obtained from (Zhu et al., 2013) (Supplemental Table 3). Vc,max and Jmax

293

of soybean grown under ambient and elevated [CO2] in the field had been determined previously

294

(Bernacchi et al., 2005). This was the same germplasm, site and treatments from which the

295

transcriptional data, used in developing the GRN, was obtained. Here the Vc,max and Jmax

296

obtained in ambient [CO2] was used to calibrated the metabolic model, which on integration with

297

the other models was then used to attempt to predict the observed changes in the Vc,max and Jmax

298

observed with growth at elevated [CO2]. Calibration was achieve by adjustinge amounts of

299

Rubisco to match the Vc,max described for soybean grown in ambient [CO2]. All other protein

300

amounts in the metabolic model, were elevated maintaining the proportion used in (Zhu et al.,

301

2013), until a Jmax was achieved that matched that observed by (Bernacchi et al., 2005). This

302

required multiplying each by 1.2 over those used in (Zhu et al., 2013) (Supplemental table 3).

303

The enzyme kinetic parameters of e-Photosynthesis are for 25°C. Leaf temperatures in the

304

simulations used here slightly exceeded this. To deal with these slight, but variable, increases in

305

temperature parameters were adjusted to the actual leaf temperature (Ti) using a Q10 function, as

306

described previously (Woodrow and Berry, 1988).

The predicted enzyme protein concentration changes as a percentage of that in ambient [CO2]

were assumed in direct proportion to the changes of enzyme activities (Vmax) in the metabolic

model. For example, if the predicted sedoheptulose-1:5 bisphosphatase (SBPase) protein

concentration was predicted to increase by 3% under elevated [CO2], then SBPase activity

311

(Vmax_Rubisco) was also increased by 3% in metabolic model.

Sensitivity analysis of each step in the metabolic model

314

Metabolic control analysis defines the quantitative link between the flux through a pathway and

315

the activity of an enzyme in terms of the flux control coefficient (Fell, 1998). The maximum

316

activity of each enzyme (Vmaxi) was both increased and decreased by 1% individually in the

317

model to calculate the new photosynthesis rate (A+ and A-) for the two CO2 concentrations (350

318

ppm vs 550 ppm) to identify the enzymes that most influence the net photosynthetic rate. The

319

flux control coefficient (CC) of each enzyme was calculated as:

Where A is the original net leaf CO2 uptake rate, before the simulated change in activity of

Leaf level photosynthesis model

324

At the leaf level, the metabolic model was integrated with leaf level models of stomatal

325

physiology, and energy balance based on the method of (Nikolov et al., 1995). Here, stomatal

326

conductance is a function of predicted net leaf CO2 uptake rate, humidity, and [CO2] after

327

(Collatz et al., 1991). Leaf energy balance takes account of intercepted short and long wave

328

radiation, radiative energy loss from the leaf, convection and latent heat loss in transpiration.

329

However, these models are inter-dependent. For example, CO2 uptake rate affects stomatal

330

conductance, stomatal conductance affects leaf temperature and leaf temperature affects CO2

331

uptake rate. Solving these circular connections is achieved iteratively. Iteration continues until

332

change to obtain a numerical solution of stomata conductance, leaf temperature, boundary-layer

333

conductance and photosynthesis rate until changes in all four are <0.1% between iterations. This

334

model is also implemented in MATLAB. Equations and parameters are listed in supplemental

335

information (Supplemental table 4).

A multiscale model of soybean can mimic photosynthetic acclimation observed in FACE

339

experiments

340

The integrated model predicted new steady-state enzyme concentrations for selected

341

reactions belonging to the dark reactions and starch synthesis in the e-Photosynthesis model in

342

response to growth of soybean leaves under elevated [CO2]. The ratio of predicted steady-state

343

enzyme concentrations in elevated to ambient CO2 is used as one of the inputs in the e-

344

Photosynthesis model (Supplemental Table 5). Though the magnitude of the change is small, the

345

predicted CO2 response is consistent with the altered photosynthetic phenotype, as shown by the

346

improved fit to the measured response of Asat to leaf intercellular [CO2] and the values of Vc,max

347

and Jmax calculated from this response (Bernacchi et al., 2005) (Figure 1). Including the gene

348

349

expression data, the Vcmax of the predicted CO2 response curve decreases from 115 to 109 μmol
m-2 s-1, and Jmax of the predicted curve increase from 149 to 153 μmol m-2 s-1. Simulations reveal

350

no significant change in leaf temperature, transpiration and stomatal conductance

351

(Supplementary Figure 1). Importantly, the fully integrated model was able to simulate the

352

change in photosynthetic rate due to the acclimation response observed in soybean plants grown

353

under elevated [CO2] (Figure 1). The predicted Asat in 550 ppm [CO2] increased by 17.7%

354

compared to ambient. Predicted metabolite concentrations also changed dynamically with

355

elevation of [CO2], for example RubP decreased, PGA, T3P and SBP increased, as would be

356

expected from an increased flux into these pools with accelerated carboxylation and decreased

357

oxygenation at Rubisco (Figure 3).

358

359

in silico perturbations reveal potential mechanisms for the transcriptional regulation of

360

photosynthetic acclimation

361

Genes with a functional role in the same biological pathway are often co-expressed and

362

sometimes co-regulated. The identification of common cis-regulatory elements in the promoters

363

of tightly co-expressed genes is a good proxy for co-regulation (Allocco et al., 2004). The

364

corresponding transcription factors that bind to these CREs are promising targets for the

365

manipulation of whole pathway expression. The re-engineering of photosynthesis is needed to

366

increase crop productivity in response to climate change (Zhu et al., 2010), such as overcoming

367

the limitations caused by photosynthetic acclimation at elevated atmospheric [CO2]. With a fully

368

integrated model of photosynthesis it was then possible to simulate the field-level photosynthetic

369

response to genetic perturbations under both ambient (380 ppm) and elevated (550 ppm) [CO2].

370

The ideotype for elevated [CO2] is one in which Rubisco content is substantially decreased and

371

controlling components of the apparatus for RubP regeneration substantially increased. This

372

problem was approached by revisiting the individual models to identify gene targets that

373

significantly contribute to deliver this metabolic ideotype.

374

375

Sensitivity of the system to individual steps within photosynthetic carbon metabolism

376

To determine which steps in the system exert the strongest control on Asat in both ambient and

377

elevated [CO2], a sensitivity analysis was performed by varying each parameter +/- 1% (Table

378

1). Control coefficients (CCs) are calculated as the ratio of change in the amount of one enzyme

379

divided by change in Asat. If a 1% change in enzyme x results in a 1% change in Asat CC = 1, the

380

maximum possible, while if the change in Asat is zero, then CC = 0, meaning that no control is

381

exerted by that enzyme. The sum of all control coefficients should approximate to 1. Rubisco

382

has the highest CC of all enzymes in ambient [CO2], while SBPase has the highest control

383

coefficient in elevated CO2 (Table 1). Nine enzymes with the highest CCs overall (>0.01) were

384

further evaluated for transcriptional regulation.

385

A CO2–responsive gene regulatory network reveals co-regulated genes

386

A static gene regulatory network (GRN) of the nine enzymes with the highest CCs from

387

the e-Photosynthesis model was constructed using transcriptome data from soybean grown under

388

ambient and elevated [CO2] (Leakey et al., 2009). Network nodes represent the genes that

389

encode the nine enzymes involved in photosynthesis with the highest CC. Network edges

390

represent regulatory interactions between TFs and putative, co-expressed target genes as

391

determined by rank correlation of expression (MR >= 0.8 and PCC >= |0.6|) and the significant

392

presence of CREs in the promoter of target genes for a corresponding TF gene. The static GRN

393

was used to define the regulatory interactions that contribute to the expression of each target

394

gene, in which each gene of interest (GOI) may have more than one TF protein regulating its

395

expression. A linear regression modeling approach (Karlebach and Shamir, 2008) was used to

396

determine the strength of influence, or weight (w), of each TF predicted to regulate a GOI. The

397

resulting equations containing weighted TF-target interactions that enabled dynamic simulations

398

with the GRN, where the expression of any TF in the network could be modified (up- or down-

399

regulated) and result in a predicted change in expression of the target GOI (Figure 4).

400

The dynamic GRN (Figure 5) was explored to identify TFs that would simultaneously

401

down-regulate carboxylation of Rubisco and up-regulate RubP regeneration and starch synthesis.

402

Based on network topology, the top three candidate TFs are GmWRKY71 (Glyma.07G023300),

403

a bHLH transcription factor (Glyma.18G115700), and GmGATA2 (Glyma.01G169400)

404

(Supplemental Figure 2). in silico perturbations were performed for each candidate TF in which

405

the TF expression was eliminated (knock-out) or overexpressed. Simulations within the dynamic

406

GRN resulted in newly predicted expression levels of all genes targeted by the TF of interest

407

(Figure 4).

408

The predicted change in mRNA expression provided input for the protein translation

409

model that in turn predicted steady-state enzyme concentrations under elevated and ambient

410

[CO2] as described in the Model Development section. The ratio of steady-state protein levels

411

were then fed into the fully integrated photosynthesis model to obtain predicted changes in

412

photosynthesis rate. The in silico over-expression of GmWRKY71 and GmGATA2, and the

413

knockout of the bHLH TF resulted in a predicted increase in photosynthetic rate under both

414

ambient and elevated [CO2]. A simultaneous in silico over-expression of GmWRKY71 and

415

knock-out of bHLH TF increased the overall photosynthesis rate compared to wild type, but

416

these failed to significantly lower Rubisco and release the resource that would be needed to

417

elevate capacity for RubP regeneration without more resource investment (Figure 6A-C). The

418

most promising TF candidate according to model simulations is the overexpression of

419

GmGATA2, which results in the most dramatic change to both the down-regulation of

420

carboxylation and up-regulation of RubP regeneration based on the simulated A/Ci curve (Figure

421

6D).

DISCUSSION

424

Multi-scale models have the potential to identify and add missing mechanistic details

425

about system function and generate new hypotheses to prioritize targeted engineering efforts in

426

plant science (Marshall-Colon et al., 2017, Millar et al., 2019). More than 4,000 mathematical

427

plant models were published over the last decade. The majority of these models describe one

428

biological scale or process and generalize the un-modeled spatio-temporal processes as a single

429

output from a black box. Linking single-scale models will improve the comprehensive

430

investigation of biological systems, resulting in explanatory models with higher prediction

431

accuracy than models limited to one biological scale. The ability to interrogate biology at many

432

resolutions can reveal emergent system behaviors that cannot easily be measured (Walpole et al.,

433

2013). Multiscale models that link genes to phenotypes can accelerate the directed development

434

of crop ideotypes. Until now metabolic modeling has predicted ideotypes with maximal

435

photosynthetic efficiency for given environmental conditions with respect to distribution of

436

resources between photosynthetic proteins. Achieving the ideotype then depends on identifying

437

individual genes that might be up- or down- regulated. The multi-scale model may now be used

438

not only to predict the metabolic ideotype, but the gene expression changes at the network level

439

needed to achieve this. In turn, this has led, as demonstrated here, to the identification of

440

transcription factors that can achieve the multiple gene expression changes needed by alteration

441

of the expression of just one or two transcription factors.

442

In this study, we constructed a multiscale model of soybean leaf photosynthesis by

443

integrating three models across molecular and organ-level scales using asynchronous message

444

passing. By informing the leaf micrometeorological model with gene-level data, we were able to

445

simulate the field-observed phenomena of photosynthetic acclimation in soybean plants grown

446

under two different atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Acclimation was previously suggested to

447

be a transcriptionally driven process that increases the capacity of respiration (Leakey et al.,

448

2009). This though does not explain the observed decrease in in vivo Rubisco activity (Vc,max)

449

and increase in capacity for RuBP regeneration (Jmax) by (Bernacchi et al., 2005). Existing

450

models of photosynthesis do not provide a means to link observed transcriptional changes with

451

metabolism and photosynthetic capacity at the leaf level. Our integrated model overcomes this

452

and not only suggests the changes in mRNA levels and how these affect photosynthetic

453

metabolism, but was able to predict the acclimation of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation that had

454

been observed (Figure 1). Previous studies have reported proteome-level changes in response to

455

elevated CO2 in soybean and other crop species (Ainsworth and Long, 2005, Bokhari et al.,

456

2007, Taub et al., 2007, Yousuf et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2019).

457

Interestingly, only 48 out of the 81 genes that encode enzymes in the e-Photosynthesis

458

model had a statistically significant change in expression in elevated [CO2], and only 17 had a

459

fold change >1.5. Since the ratio of change in enzyme concentration was proportional to the

460

change in transcript concentration, it reveals that even a slight modification to the e-

461

Photosynthesis model resulted in better prediction accuracy of field observations. This result

462

represents the double-edged sword of multiscale modeling, in which fine-tuning at the molecular

463

level can have drastic consequences at higher scales. Errors can propagate in multiscale models

464

as information is exchanged across spatial and temporal scales. However, empirical validation of

465

the model outputs at any scale can minimize error propagation. In our study, field data

466

corroborated model simulations, providing confidence in the success of the modeling approach

467

and the biologically relevant flow of information from genes to organs.

468

469

in silico perturbations identified transcriptional regulators of photosynthesis

470

The successful manipulation of photosynthetic efficiency has been achieved through

471

targeted engineering of individual enzymes (Köhler et al., 2017, Driever et al., 2017), but an

472

alternative strategy is to simultaneously alter the expression of suites of enzymes involved in

473

different parts of the photosynthesis pathway (Simkin et al., 2017). Understanding the

474

transcriptional regulation of photosynthesis genes may help to fine-tune pathway expression

475

under different environmental conditions, so avoiding the need to directly engineer change in

476

expression of genes for each enzyme. This study uncovered three TFs, GmWRKY71,

477

GmGATA2, and a bHLH TF, which potentially regulate the expression of genes encoding key

478

enzymes involved in photosynthesis. While the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation

479

of genes involved in photosynthesis have previously been explored (Isono et al., 1997,

480

Fankhauser and Aubry, 2016, Saibo et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2017a, Zhang et al., 2016), this is

481

the first report of targeted GRN analysis to identify TFs that specifically co-regulate the

482

carboxylation of Rubisco and RubP regeneration.

483

Our hypothesis driven approach sought to explore how decreasing Rubisco and

484

reallocating resources to RubP regeneration might increase Asat. The dynamic GRN identified

485

high-confidence TF-target gene relationships between photosynthesis genes that have a high

486

control coefficient and TFs tightly co-expressed with those genes. Using diverse training data,

487

we were able to derive weights associated with each TF-target interaction, indicating which TFs

488

exerted the greatest transcriptional control. Several TFs were found to co-regulate genes

489

affecting Rubisco and RubP regeneration (Figure 5). However, only GmGATA2 was predicted

490

to significantly down-regulate genes affecting Rubisco synthesis and up-regulating genes that

491

would increase RubP regeneration and starch synthesis. The multiscale model simulations for the

492

knockout and overexpression of GmGATA2 suggest a mechanism by which the transcriptional

493

regulation of key photosynthetic genes can alter flux through the pathway. For example, the

494

overexpression of GmGATA2 resulted in decreased Vc_max and increased Jmax, as would be

495

required to maximize efficiency in an elevated [CO2] environment (Table 2; (Drake et al., 1997,

496

Long et al., 2004)). The rewiring of metabolism, under both ambient and elevated CO2, produces

497

a change in photosynthetic efficiency, which is a leaf-level phenotype. Specifically, the KO of

498

GmGATA2 decreases overall photosynthetic capacity only in ambient [CO2], while

499

overexpression results in a large decrease in carboxylation and increase in RubP regeneration

500

according to the A/Ci curve (Figure 6D).

501

All of the top candidate TFs from our model simulations belong to TF families that have

502

previously been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of photosynthesis (Saibo et al.,

503

2008). For example, bHLH TFs (Myc Family of TFs) were found to regulate aspects of C4

504

photosynthesis that are also related to genes in the ancestral C3 state (Borba et al., 2018).

505

Interestingly, a number of other studies identified the GATA family of transcription factors as

506

important regulators of photosynthesis and of carbon and nitrogen balance. The overexpression

507

of Class B GATAs and GLKs in Arabidopsis roots improved photosynthesis by increasing root

508

509

chlorophyll content (Ohnishi et al., 2018). GmGATA2 is annotated as NITRATEINDUCIBLE,

CARBON METABOLISMINVOLVED (GNC) and is homologous to AtGATA5, and both are

510

Class A GATAs that are associated with the light regulation of gene expression and

511

photomorphogenesis (Zhang et al., 2015). The overexpression of the poplar PdGNC gene in

512

Arabidopsis improved photosynthesis under low N levels by increasing the size and number of

513

chloroplasts per cell. The photosynthetic rate in transgenics increased by 42% compared to WT

514

lines (An et al., 2014). These studies with structurally or functionally similar GATA TFs provide

515

support for the role of GmGATA2 in the regulation of photosynthesis. Our GRN analysis

516

uncovered a strong positive correlation (co-expression) between GmGATA2 and FBP-aldolase

517

and starch synthase and a strong negative correlation (anti-correlation) between GmGATA2 and

518

the gene Rbcs that encodes the RuBisCO small sub-unit. Metabolic modeling and direct up-

519

regulation have suggested that both FBP-aldolase and starch synthase exert strong control on

520

RubP-regeneration (Zhu et al., 2007, Uematsu et al., 2012, Tian et al., 2018). These network

521

predictions provide testable hypotheses for the next round of experimentation and modeling.

522

The multiscale modeling strategy described here represents a uni-directional flow of

523

information from genes to physiological phenotype. However, bi-directional inputs and outputs

524

exist between the e-Photosynthesis model and the leaf micrometeorological model, in which the

525

metabolic model can accept environmental parameters from the organ-level model. Ideally, a

526

truly dynamic and biologically accurate model would have a bi- or multi-directional flow of

527

information across scales. A limitation of this model is a lack of feedback from the metabolic

528

model to gene expression. This limitation stems from an inadequate amount of species- and

529

condition-specific transcriptional studies. Given the availability of more expression data, it

530

would be possible to include a model component with switch-like behavior that pulls in

531

appropriate expression data based on environment-level inputs. Alternatively, given protein

532

expression data it may be possible to leverage the proportional relationship between change in

533

protein concentration and change in transcript levels to predict gene expression based on protein

534

levels. Regardless of the method, this gap in information flow is an area of focus to improve the

535

current model. Moreover, this multiscale model is focused on one biological process,

536

photosynthesis. The proof-of-concept modeling approach outlined in our study provides a

537

feasible workflow, and a base model that can be expanded on to include related pathways and

538

processes that are still black boxes and beyond the scope of in our current model.

539

540

Future directions.

541

We are now poised to explore the multiscale model generated hypotheses, including the

542

functional testing of the top TF candidate genes. Ideally, these hypotheses will be tested directly

543

in soybean through the generation of transgenic plants that can be grown in FACE experiments

544

(Ainsworth et al., 2008). Likewise, the model is in place for expansion to include additional

545

metabolic pathways, but also scale to other levels. For example, the leaf micrometeorological

546

model is already a sub-component of a canopy-level model (Drewry et al., 2010, Srinivasan et

547

al., 2017), so an intuitive next step would be link to models that provide 3-D biophysical

548

representations of stands of plants, as for example those developed for sugarcane agronomy

549

(Wang et al., 2017b). This allows simulations with more realistic inputs for light capture and

550

competition between plants. Finally, advanced visualization of multiscale model outputs will be

551

an important next step in the simulation and analysis of in silico crops. Combined modeling and

552

visualization approaches will lead to realistic simulations of ideotypes to guide selection of

553

genetic targets for crop improvement (Marshall-Colon et al., 2017).

Conclusion

556

Despite the many assumptions that have had to be made in this first linkage of gene expression

557

networks, through protein concentrations and photosynthetic metabolism to leaf level CO2

558

exchange, it was successful in accurately predicting the observed acclimation of photosynthetic

559

capacity in soybean when grown under elevated [CO2]. Most importantly it is shown to provide

560

a numerical means to identify from many hundreds of possible transcription factors, those most

561

likely to adapt photosynthetic efficiency to global atmospheric change. It opens the way to

562

guiding sustainable adaptation of crop photosynthesis to a range of both current and future

563

environments.

Figure 2. Model integration schematic describing the scaling from the gene regulatory network

770

model to the metabolic model to the leaf physiological model. Note that these models interact

771

through state variable indicated in the arrows. Ca is ambient CO2 concentration, PPFD is the

772

amount of light absorbed by the leaf, T is leaf temperature and A is the net carbon assimilation.

Figure 5. Gene regulatory network of metabolic genes having control coefficient > 0.01 based on

784

sensitivity analysis of the metabolic model enzymes after incorporating gene expression data.

785

Figure shows transcription factors as triangles and metabolic genes as squares. The network also

786

shows change in mRNA expression of these genes under elevated CO2 concentration in leaves

787

with blue nodes indicating downregulation and orange nodes indicating upregulation under

788

elevated CO2 as compared to ambient CO2. Similarly, blue edges indicate predicted repression

789

and orange edges indicate predicted activation of the metabolic gene by the TF. Thickness of the

790

edges are based on linear model weights with more thickness indicating a heavier weight

791

associated with the TF-target interaction.
