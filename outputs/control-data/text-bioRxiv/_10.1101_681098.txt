Abstract
Due to the wide use of nuclear energy, nuclear radiation threat is increasing day
by day. However, methods for protection against nuclear radiation are limited
and not effective. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective method for
protection and therapy against injury caused by radiation. According to the law
of biological evolution, one of the most primitive eukaryotes, Paramecium, could
be tolerant to ionizing radiations, in a way similar to or better than Ramazzottius

varieornatus and Bdelloids rotifer. Therefore, in the present study, the
anti-radiation effects of Paramecium were explored, which could be applicable to
human beings. Paramecium was found to be tolerant to 60Co γ rays, and its half
lethal dose (LD50) was approximately 3000 Gy, which is 60 times more than that
of human beings. The GSPATT00021409001 and GSPATT00016349001 genes
were significantly up-regulated, which might play a role in DNA binding and
nuclear transport, and thus, could function in DNA protection or repair. The
biological function of the two genes and their effects in humans need to be
explored in future studies.

Introduction
With the development of physics, nuclear energy was discovered, and it presently
has multiple applications. As fossil fuel reserves are limited, nuclear energy is
expected to become the major source of energy1. In recent years, the number of
nuclear power stations have increased. Moreover, the storage of nuclear
weapons is increasing, and consequently, there is a rise in nuclear weapon threat.
Thus, the threat of nuclear radiation damage to human beings has also increased.
Although the effects and mechanism of nuclear radiation have been extensively
studied2, effective prevention and control measures against exposure to nuclear
radiation are still unknown.
When life first appeared on the earth, the environmental condition of the prima
earth was extreme, as it included high intensity cosmic rays, high temperature,
and frequent lightning. Early biological species survived and propagated under
extreme conditions, which indicates that the early biological species possessed
the mechanisms to tolerate such unfavorable conditions. The radiation intensity
on the prima earth then, would have been much higher than it is at present. Thus,
some primitive organisms may be more tolerant to nuclear radiation.
Researchers have found that Ramazzottius varieornatus3,4 and Bdelloids rotifer5,6
are highly tolerant to nuclear radiation, compared to the human beings. Similarly,
there may be a few more primitive species, which may also have a higher
tolerance to radiation. Paramecium, a unicellular organism, is more primitive than

Ramazzottius varieornatus and Bdelloids rotifer. Therefore, the radiation
tolerance ability of Paramecium needs to be studied.
This study focuses on understanding the effects of 60Co γ rays on Paramecium
and the associated changes in gene expression. The Paramecium was irradiated
with serial doses of γ ray ranging from 100 Gy to 4000 Gy. Interestingly,

Paramecium was found to be tolerant to γ ray irradiation, and the half lethal dose
(LD50) was approximately 3000 Gy, which is 60 times more than that of human
beings. Expression profile sequencing was performed to study the radiation
protection genes of Paramecium, and significant changes were found in the
genes. Thus, these genes may play a role in protection against radiation.
Moreover, these genes can also be used to develop new drugs or methods for
protection or therapy against radiation injury.

Methods
Culturing and isolation of Paramecium
A sample from the field was collected, and a single Paramecium cell was isolated
using a 10 μl micropipette by viewing it under an inverted phase contrast
microscope. The single cell was then inoculated into wheat grain medium and
incubated at 28°C with normal air.
The wheat grain medium was prepared by using high pressure to treat the wheat
grains, followed by drying them in a drying box to improve its shelf life. The
treated wheat grains were then boiled in the water for at least 30 min. It was

allowed to cool and then exposed to air for 24 h, following which it was used for
extended culture of the isolated Paramecium.
Treatment of Paramecium using γ rays

Paramecium was irradiated with 100 Gy, 500 Gy, 1000 Gy, 2000 Gy, 3000 Gy, and
4000 Gy doses of γ rays . After irradiation, the Paramecium was observed and
counted under the light microscope at 40× magnification for 5 sec under each
visual field. This was repeated 4 times for each dose of radiation. The γ rays
were produced from the nuclear decay of

60

Co, which was provided by the

Radiation Center of Second Military Medical University.
Expression profile sequencing of Paramecium treated with γ rays
To explore the mechanism of γ ray tolerance in Paramecium, expression profile
sequencing was performed. For expression profile sequencing, the Paramecium
was irradiated with 60Co γ rays at a dose of 2000 Gy. After irradiation, the cells
were centrifuged and dissolved in RNAiso for further RNA extraction. Total RNA
(1 μg) was used for extracting rRNA using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA
libraries were constructed by using the RNA devoid of rRNA with the help of the
TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA),
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Library quality control and
quantification was performed using the BioAnalyzer 2100 system (Agilent
Technologies, Inc., USA). The library (10 pM) was denatured into single-stranded
DNA molecules, captured on Illumina flow cells, amplified in situ as clusters and

sequenced for 150 cycles on the Illumina HiSeq Sequencer according to the
manufacturer's instructions. High throughput sequencing service was provided
by CloudSeq Biotech (Shanghai, China).
Prediction of the structure and function of different expression genes
Expression profile sequencing of the significant expression genes was carried out,
and the structure of the translated proteins was predicted using the
SWISS-MODEL (https://www.swissmodel.expasy.org/). The SWISS-MODEL is an
automated system for modelling the 3D structure of a protein from its amino
acid sequence using homology modelling techniques7. The translated proteins
was also classified using the ProtoNet 6.0 (http://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il) tool,
which is a data structure of protein families that cover the protein sequence
space.8
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical computations were performed
using the GraphPad Prism version 6.0. A P<0.05 was considered statistically
significant. (*** indicate P<0.001)

decrease under an irradiation of 2000 Gy. However, the number of Paramecium
reduced significantly above an irradiation of 3000 Gy. At 4000 Gy, most of the

Paramecium cells died; however, the few that survived had structural deformity.
According to these results, the LD50 (50% lethal dose) of γ rays to Paramecium
was determined to be approximately 3000 Gy. (Figure 1-2, Supplementary Movie
1-7).

A death rate of 100% was observed in human beings exposed to an irradiation
dose of over 8 Gy 9. An irradiation dose of more than 15Gy, causes acute
radiation sickness, leading to immediate nausea and vomiting, and death within
48 h 9,10.

However, primitive organisms, such as Ramazzottius varieornatus and Bdelloids

rotifer, are more tolerant to the irradiation than human beings, including whole
organism body and cells. Both Ramazzottius varieornatus and Bdelloids rotifer
are highly tolerant to ionizing radiations over a dose of kGy, and the
anhydrobiotic condition was more radioresistant than the hydrated one. Thus,
according to our results, Paramecium showed higher radio-resistance than
human beings, similar to Ramazzottius varieornatus and Bdelloids rotifer. There
might be a common mechanism used by these primitive species to tolerate the
radiations which needs to be explored.

γ rays induced high expression genes may play a role in tolerance towards
radiation
Studying the gene expression changes of Paramecium irradiated with γ rays will
help understand the radiation protection mechanism of Paramecium. By using
high-throughput sequencing methods, the expression profile sequencing of

Paramecium treated with γ rays at a dose of 2000 Gy was studied. It was found
that exposure to γ rays up-regulated expression of 25 genes and
down-regulated expression of 34 genes in Paramecium. A p value lower than
0.05 was obtained (Figure 3A, B).

may form a homo-tetramer, and showed a DNA/RNA binding function (Figure

being irradiated and may have DNA protective effects, similar to the Dsup
protein of Tardigrades. Moreover, GSPATT00016349001 protein was predicted to
form a homo-dimer, and it may be a member of the nuclear transport factor 2
(Figure 4B), which may have the function of carrying the protein through the

Conclusion
In this study, we showed that Paramecium was strongly tolerant to 60Co γ rays,
and the LD50 was approximately 3000 Gy, which was much higher than the LD50
of human beings. Expression profile sequencing assay showed that γ rays can
induce various gene expression changes. Among these, two upregulated genes,
including GSPATT00021409001 and GSPATT00016349001 genes, may perform
important functions in anti-radiation damage, according to the function
prediction tool. However, certain biological effects of GSPATT00021409001 and
GSPATT00016349001 proteins are still unknown. Moreover, the ability of the γ
ray protection genes of Paramecium to replicate their effects in human cells
needs to be further studied.
