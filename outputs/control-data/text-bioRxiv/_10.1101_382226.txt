Abstract

17

Unphysiological reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation is considered an important

18

pathomechanism for several disease phenotypes with high unmet medical need. Therapeutically,

19

antioxidants have failed multiple times. Instead, focusing on only disease-relevant, enzymatic

20

sources of ROS appears to be a more promising and highly validated approach. Here the family of

21

five NADPH oxidases (NOX) stands out as drug targets. Validation has been restricted, however,

22

mainly to genetically modified rodents and is lacking in other species including human. It is thus

23

unclear whether the different NOX isoforms are sufficiently distinct to allow selective

24

pharmacological modulation. Here we show for five of the most advanced NOX inhibitors that

25

indeed isoform selectivity can be achieved. NOX1 was most potently (IC50) targeted by ML171 (0.1

26

µM); NOX2, by VAS2870 (0.7 µM); NOX4, by M13 (0.01 µM) and NOX5, by ML090 (0.01 µM).

27

Conditions need to be carefully controlled though as previously unrecognized non-specific

28

antioxidant and assay artefacts may limit the interpretation of data and this included, surprisingly,

29

one of the most advanced NOX inhibitors, GKT136901. As proof-of-principle that now also

30

pharmacological and non-rodent target validation of different NOX isoforms is possible, we used a

31

human blood-brain barrier model and NOX inhibitor panel at IC50 concentrations. The protective

32

efficacy pattern of this panel confirmed the predominant role of NOX4 in stroke from previous

33

genetic models. Our findings strongly encourage further lead optimization efforts for isoform-

34

selective NOX inhibitors and clinical development and provide an experimental alternative when

35

genetic validation of a NOX isoform is not an option.

Introduction

37

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered an important pathomechanism for several

38

common diseases with high unmet medical need including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative as

39

well as cancer. Yet, clinical translation of this hypothesis into therapeutic application by use of

40

antioxidants that scavenge ROS has consistently failed [1], in some cases even increasing mortality

41

[2-4]. This paradox was initially explained by these compounds being underdosed, thereby not

42

reaching efficacy. It is now understood, however, that ROS are not only harmful metabolic by-

43

products, but also serve important protective, metabolic and signaling functions, such as the

44

regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival, innate immune response,

45

vascular tone, neuronal signaling as well as inflammation [5-8]. Anti-oxidants are likely to

46

simultaneously interfere with both qualities of ROS, the physiological and pathophysiological ones

47

with overall neutral or even deleterious outcomes. Thus, ROS should not be modulated in a

48

systemic manner, but rather by identifying for each disease condition the relevant enzymatic ROS

49

source and inhibit this source by selective pharmacological inhibitors [9].

50

Several enzymatic sources of ROS exist [10, 11]. NADPH oxidases (NOX), however, stand

51

out as they are the only known dedicated, evolutionary conserved ROS-forming enzyme family. All

52

other enzymes produce ROS as a byproduct or due to being damaged. Disease relevance has been

53

suggested for NOX1, contributing to diabetic atherosclerosis [12] and retinopathy [13]; NOX2,

54

neurodegeneration [14]; NOX4, stroke [15], diabetic nephropathy [16] and neuropathic pain [17],

55

but protection against diabetic atherosclerosis [18, 19]; and NOX5, stroke [20], diabetic

56

nephropathy [21, 22], hypertension [23] and coronary artery disease [24]. Target validation in these

57

cases, however, has been done primarily by gene knock-out (as reviewed in [25]) and, in the case of

58

NOX5 [21], by knock-in technology limiting most data sets to mice and, in the case of NOX4, in

59

addition to rat [15].

60

For target validation in other species and eventual clinical translation, NOX-specific and

61

ideally isoform-selective NOX inhibitors are desirable. It is unclear, however, whether this is or will

62

be achievable given the fact that all five relevant NOX isoforms (NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, NOX4 and

63

NOX5) are similarly structured transmembrane proteins containing highly conserved catalytic

64

heme, FAD and NADPH binding sites. Some degree of variability derives from more (NOX1 and

65

NOX2) or less (NOX4 and NOX5) binding partners or a unique regulation by calcium binding

66

(NOX5) [26]. Furthermore, for each compound two potential sources of error need to be

67

considered: (a) direct scavenging of ROS [27, 28] in instead of or in addition to NOX inhibition;

68

and (b) interference with the ROS detection probes [29, 30]. Finally, from an efficacy and safety

69

point of view whole cell-based assays provide additional information on membrane permeability

70

and cytotoxicity.

71

Here, we examine some of the best characterized and/or most widely used NOX inhibitors,

72

VAS2870, ML171, GKT136901, M13 and ML09 in a whole cell assay approach by analyzing

73

isoform selectivity, possible assay interference and direct ROS-scavenging capacity. Finally, we

74

suggest a NOX inhibitor/NOX isoform panel, which we then validate for usability in

75

pharmacological target validation using human brain microvascular endothelial cell model of

76

ischemia-induced hyperpermeability where NOX4 had previously been clearly validated as the key

77

NOX isoform [15, 31].

103

were then centrifuged at 300xg, washed with HBSS and re-suspended in HBSS to the final seeding

104

density needed for the experiment (5 x 105 cells/well in 96 well plate).

105

RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis

106

RNA was extracted using RNeasy® Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s

107

protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA in 20 µl reactions using High Capacity

108

cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After synthesis, the cDNA was stored

109

at −20°C.

110

Quantitative Real-Time PCR

111

RT-qPCR was performed on CFX96TM Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). All

112

reactions were performed in triplicates in a total volume of 20 µl each using TaqMan® Universal

113

PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems- Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s

114

instructions. 3 µl cDNA was used as template and pre-designed TaqMan® primers of β-actin, Nox1,

115

Nox2, Nox4 and Nox5 were used. The specific assay ID for the primers used are shown in

116

supplementary Table S1. The standard PCR conditions were as follows: 10 min at 95 °C, followed

117

by 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C, 59 repeats. The amount of mRNA was normalized to the

118

measured expression of β-actin mRNA.

ROS measurement in intact cells

120

a. Luminol assay

121

To measure NOX1 activity, superoxide from vector-transfected or NOX1-transfected

122

HEK293 cells was measured by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence in white plates. For this

123

assay HEK293 cells were transfected with NOX1, NOXO1 and NOXA1. After 48 hrs, cells were

124

removed from the flasks by trypsinization and were re-suspended in PBS. 50 µl cell suspension

125

consisting of 100,000 cells was added in triplicate to a 96-well plate in KRPG buffer and incubated

126

at 37ºC for 60 min. After 1 hr of incubation, 50 µl reaction buffer containing 6.4 U/ml HRP and 0.4

127

mM luminol in KRPG buffer was added. Cells were stimulated by addition of 0.5 µM Phorbol 12-

128

myristate 13-acetate (PMA; PKC activator). ROS generation was detected by monitoring relative

129

light units (RLU) with a Wallac luminometer Victor2 at 37ºC for 60 min. Superoxide dismutase

130

was added as control before PMA stimulation in selected wells.

131

b. Amplex Red assay

132

To measure the activity of NOX4 and NOX5, H2O2 production was measured in HEK293

133

cells using Amplex Red fluorescence. For the measurement, vector-transfected HEK293 cells or

134

HEK293 cells transfected with NOX4 or NOX5 were trypsinized, counted, washed and re-

135

suspended in Krebs-Ringer-Phosphate Glucose buffer (KRPG). NOX inhibitors dissolved in DMSO

136

or solvent control (0.5% DMSO) were added to respective wells of a black 96-well plate and 50 µl

137

of a reaction mixture containing 0.1 U·mL-1 HRP and 50 µM Amplex Red was added to each well

138

according to the kit manual and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Thereafter, 100,000 of respective

139

HEK293 cells or solvent control in 50 µl of KPRG-buffer were added to each well. Amplex Red

140

fluorescence was measured immediately at excitation (530-560 nm) and emission ~ 590 nm at 37ºC

141

for 60 min. HEK293 cells expressing NOX5 were activated by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (40

142

µM).

143

c. Cytochrome C assay

144

To measure NOX2 activity, superoxide production in HL-60 cells was measured by

145

cytochrome C reduction as described previously [32]. Briefly, cytochrome C (100 µM) was added

146

to the DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cell suspension. After adding 5 x 105 cells to a 96-well plate and

147

addition of inhibitors, a basal reading was performed at 540 nm (isosbestic point of cytochrome C)

148

and 550 nm (SpectraMax 340; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Subsequently, the

149

oxidative burst was initiated by the addition of 100 nM PMA. After incubation for 60 min. at 37°C

150

the absorbance was measured. Signals were normalized to the basal readings. In addition,

151

superoxide dismutase was added as control before PMA stimulation in selected wells.

152

Superoxide measurement in cell-free assays

153

Xanthine (X; final concentration: 50 µm) and cytochrome C (final concentration: 100 µm)

154

were dissolved in HBSS, and 100 µL aliquots of this solution were transferred to individual wells of

155

a 96-well plate. After addition of the oxidase inhibitors, the mixtures were allowed to equilibrate for

156

20 min. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 µL xanthine oxidase (XO) (final

157

concentration: 5 mU·mL-1), and absorbance at 540 and 550 nm was recorded 10 min. after the start

158

of the reaction. Superoxide production was calculated by normalization to the signals obtained at

159

540 nm. Similar experiments were performed with 0.4 mM luminol instead of cytochrome C. After

160

20 min. equilibration, the reaction was started with XOD (1 mU·mL-1), and chemiluminescence

161

was subsequently recorded for 20 min. in a Fluoroscan FL microplate reader. Signals were

162

calculated as AUC and normalized to the X/XOD-derived control signal. Accordingly, a counter

163

screen has been performed with cytochrome C or luminol without X/XO-generated superoxide.

164

H2O2 measurement in cell-free system

165

The fluorescence of Amplex Red was measured in presence and absence of H2O2 (0.25 µM),

166

reflecting NOX4 and NOX5 output. After addition of inhibitors and 50 µl Amplex Red reaction

167

mixture containing 100 U·mL-1 HRP and 10 mM Amplex Red to each well, the plate was incubated

168

at 37°C for 10 min. Thereafter, the plate was read at excitation (530-560 nm) and emission ~ 590

169

nm at 37ºC and for 60 min. Data was calculated as the AUC over 60 min. and data were normalized

170

to H2O2 output in absence of inhibitor.

171

Cell permeability in HBMECs

172

For the passive dye diffusion assay, 2 x 104 human brain microvascular endothelial cells

173

(HBMECs) were grown to confluence on membranes of Transwell inserts (collagen-coated

174

Transwell Pore Polyester Membrane Insert; pore size = 3.0 µm (Corning, The Netherlands) Fig.

175

5A). After 6hrs of ischemia, cells were treated with 0,1 µM ML171, 0,6 µM VAS2870, 1 µM

176

GKT136901, 0,2 µM M13 or 0,01 µM ML090 during 24hrs of re-oxygenation. Thereafter, cell

177

permeability was assessed using Evans Blue (Sigma-Aldrich, The Netherlands) (Fig. 5B). First, the

178

medium was removed and previously warmed (37°C) PBS (1,5 ml) was added to the abluminal side

179

of the insert. Permeability buffer (0,5 ml) containing 4% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich,

180

The Netherlands) and 0,67 mg/ml Evans blue dye in PBS was loaded on the luminal side of the

181

insert followed by 15 min. incubation at 37°C. The concentration of Evans Blue in the abluminal

182

chamber was measured by determining the absorbance of 200 µl buffer at 630 nm using a

183

microplate reader.

184

Statistical analysis

185

Data analysis was performed using Prism 6.0g software package (GraphPad Software, San

186

Diego, USA). IC50 values were calculated with a non-linear regression analysis using an algorithm

187

for sigmoidal dose–response with variable slopes. Results are expressed as means ± SEM.

188

Statistical differences between means were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni

189

correction for multiple comparisons. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

191

Gene expression of NOX isoforms

192

To check the expression of the different NOX isoforms, we analysed NOX1, 2, 4 and 5

193

mRNA expression in control vector-transfected HEK293 cells, HEK293 cells transfected with

194

NOX1, 2, 4 and 5 and HL-60 cells. NOX isoforms mRNA expression was measured by RT-qPCR

195

and mRNA levels were normalized to the expression of β-actin.

196

As reported previously [26, 32], NOX1 was expressed in NOX1-transfected HEK293 cells

197

(Fig. 1A), NOX2 in HL-60 (Fig. 1B), NOX4 in NOX4-transfected HEK293 (Fig. 1C) and NOX5 in

198

NOX5-transfected HEK293 (Fig. 1D) and were below detection limit (defined as 100 times lower

199

than in the respective NOX overexpressing cells) in all other cell preparations. Notably, the

200

expression of NOX isoforms did not change after treatment with the respective assay conditions i.e.

201

luminol for NOX1, cytochrome C for NOX2 and Amplex Red for NOX4 and NOX5 (Fig. 1A-1D).

202

NOX pharmacological isoform selectivity

203

To characterize the NOX isoform selectivity of the current second-generation NOX

204

inhibitors we determined concentration-dependency and efficacy of GKT136901, Ml171,

205

VAS2870, M13 and ML090 on NOX1, 2, 4, and 5 (Fig. 2A). Our preference was for cell (lines)

206

expressing a specific NOX isoform in a highly selective manner and ideally physiologically. The

207

latter is only known for NOX2 and HL-60 cells [33, 34]. For NOX1, NOX4 and NOX5, there is, to

208

our knowledge, no such native human cell line. Therefore, for these three isoforms we used

209

transiently transfected HEK-293 cells, using previously validated methodology [27].

210

Specifically, NOX2 expressing HL-60 cells or HEK293 cells transfected with NOX1,

211

NOX4 or NOX5 were incubated in presence of increasing concentrations of each compound. ROS

212

generation was subsequently induced by PMA to stimulate NOX1, NOX2 and NOX5, which was

213

assayed in presence of ionomycin. Thereafter, ROS production was assayed using a panel of

214

cellular assays with structurally unrelated probes; i.e. Amplex red, luminol or cytochrome C (Figure

215

2B). Amplex Red was used to quantify extracellular H2O2 [35], while luminol-based

216

chemiluminescence and cytochrome C-reduction were used to quantify superoxide generation. As

217

controls, medium, vector-transfected HEK293 cells and non-stimulated HL-60 cells were used (Fig.

218

S1),

219

NOX isoform concentration-response curves for GKT136901, Ml171, VAS2870, M13 and

220

ML090 were constructed (Fig. 3; see table 1 for IC50 values). GKT136901 (Fig. 3A) showed

221

selectivity for NOX1 over NOX4 and NOX5 inhibition while NOX2 inhibition was not observed.

222

The same holds true for ML171 (Fig. 3B) which is more selective for NOX1 compared to NOX4

223

and NOX5. VAS2870 (Fig. 3C) displayed NOX2 over NOX1 and NOX4 selective inhibition and

224

also slightly inhibited NOX5. The GlucoxBiotech compound M13 (Fig. 3D) showed almost

225

selective NOX4 inhibition but NOX2 (with low Emax) and NOX1 (at high concentrations) inhibition

226

was observed as well. Finally, ML090 (Fig. 3E) inhibited NOX5, NOX1 and NOX4 with

227

comparable IC50 values but enhanced Emax for NOX5 inhibition. These data suggest that NOX

228

inhibitors indeed display differential isoform targeting, albeit the single compound selectivity is yet

229

not sufficient. Therefore, combined analysis of a NOX inhibitor panel with sufficient differential

230

potencies and selectivities is suggested.

231

Non-specific anti-oxidant and assay artefacts

232

To screen for possible assay interference between GKT136901, ML171, VAS2870, M13 or

233

ML090 and the NOX1 assay, a cell-free system was performed in which each inhibitor was

234

screened in presence of luminol, 1mU/ml xanthine oxidase (XO) and 1mg xanthine (X) generating

235

superoxide. At concentrations 1µM GKT136901 did not show interference with either the

236

molecular probe or with the X/XO system (Fig. 4A). Similar findings were obtained with 0.1 µM

237

ML171, 10 µM VAS2870 and 30 nM ML090 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, 1 µM M13 enhanced

238

chemiluminescence (Fig. 4A). To identify direct interactions between assay components and

239

GKT136901, ML171, VAS2870, M13 or ML090 a cell-free counter screen was performed without

240

X/XO-generated ROS. Indeed, ML171 and VAS2870 showed reduction of the luminol-based signal

241

suggesting direct interference with luminol-based chemiluminescence (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in

242

presence of ML090 the signal was enhanced (Fig. 4B).

243

To study non-specific antioxidant effects of VAS2870, the effect of 10 µM VAS2870 was

244

studied in a cell-free system in presence of cytochrome C, and X/XO-derived ROS. In these assays,

245

VAS2870 showed significant antioxidant effects (Fig. 4C).

246

To study whether the effects of GKT136901, ML171, VAS2870, M13 and ML090 on

247

NOX4 and NOX5 are specific, a cell-free assay was performed with NOX4 or NOX5 effective

248

concentrations of each inhibitor in presence of 0.25µM H2O2 in an Amplex Red assay. ML171,

249

VAS2870, M13 and ML090 did not directly affect Amplex Red-based detection of H2O2 (Fig. 4D).

250

However, GKT136901 reduced Amplex Red-based H2O2 signals suggesting assay interference.

251

Hence, the assay was repeated without H2O2 to study potential direct assay component interference.

252

Indeed, GKT136901, ML171, M13 and ML090 reduced the signal as compared to the control (Fig.

253

4E) whereas in presence of VAS2870 the signal was enhanced (Fig. 4E).

254

Target validation of NOX in ischemia-induced hyperpermeability model

255

As predicted from the inhibitor screen, M13, GKT136901 or ML171 protect against

256

ischemia-induced hyperpermeability in HBMEC. Our data suggested that a NOX inhibitor panel

257

may be used for target validation of selective NOX isoforms. We thus tested our NOX inhibitor

258

panel in an in vitro human model of ischemia-induced hyperpermeability (Fig. 5A) where NOX4 is

259

involved in subacute hypoxia-induced increases in cell permeability whereas NOX1, NOX2 do not

260

[31] and NOX5 only acutely [20]. Primary HBMEC cultures were subjected to 6h of hypoxia

261

followed by 24h of re-oxygenation (Fig. 5B) in presence or absence of ML171 (0.1 µM; mainly

262

targeting NOX1), VAS203 (0.6 µM; mainly targeting NOX2), GKT136901 (1 µM; mainly

263

targeting NOX4), M13 (0.2 µM; mainly targeting NOX4) or ML090 (0.01 µM; mainly targeting

264

NOX5). Hypoxia increased cell permeability after 24hrs of re-oxygenation. GKT136901, and

265

ML171 treatment prevented this detrimental effect (Fig. 5C), suggesting protection against

266

hyperpermeability via NOX4 inhibition while, as expected given their respective IC50 values,

267

VAS2870 or ML090 treatment showed no effect (Fig. 5C). These data provide a proof-of-concept

268

for pharmacological target validation using NOX inhibitor panels.

269

Discussion

270

Our results show that NOX-specific and isoform-selective pharmacological NOX inhibition

271

is in principle achievable. Individual compound specificity is yet insufficient. None of the selected

272

small molecule inhibitors were sufficiently isoform selective but inhibited several NOX isoforms

273

with different ranking potencies. In addition, assay interferences, some of them previously not

274

noted, needed to be taken into consideration. Nevertheless, using a panel of NOX inhibitors

275

pharmacological validation of a specific NOX isoform was possible and examplified in a NOX4-

276

dependent model.

277

With respect to the individual NOX inhibitor compounds in this study, VAS2870 showed

278

beneficial effects in several preclinical disease models such as stroke [31], Alzheimer's disease [36],

279

thrombosis [37] and pulmonary hypertension [38]. It has been designated a pan-NOX inhibitor [39]

280

as inhibition of NOX1 [26, 40], NOX2 [26, 40, 41], NOX4 [26, 31] and NOX5 [26] activity has

281

been observed; IC50 values however have been only published for NOX2 [41, 42]. Based on the

282

here reported IC50 for all tested NOX isoforms, VAS2870 is relatively NOX2 selective (IC50 ~

283

0.7µM), followed by NOX1 and 4 in the lower and NOX5 in the higher micromolar range.

284

VAS2870 showed interference with luminol and Amplex Red assays and reduced XO-generated

285

ROS indicating antioxidant properties as reported previously [25]. Interference with XO-generated

286

ROS was 9.6% (Fig. 4C); the same concentration, however, resulted in a 91.5% decrease of the

287

NOX2-dependent signal (Fig. 3C).

288

M13, a previously unreported compound from Glucox Biotech, was identified as a first-in-

289

class relative NOX4 selective inhibitor as it was 200-times more potent in inhibiting NOX4 (IC50 ~

290

0.01 µM) versus NOX1 (IC50 ~ 0.2 µM) and showed negligible NOX2 inhibition and almost no

291

effect on NOX5. Although M13 interfered with the Amplex Red assay by 9% (Fig. 4E), this was

292

considerably less than the 40% reduction of the NOX4-dependent signal (Fig. 3D).

293

ML090 was previously described as NOX1 selective [43]. In our hands, IC50 values for

294

NOX1, 4 and 5 were quite similar suggesting ML090 to be a rather pan NOX inhibitor. Two

295

interferences were observed. The 36.8% inhibition of the NOX1-dependent signal (Fig. 3D) may

296

represent a slight underestimation because ML090 per se surprisingly increased the luminol signal

297

by 13.4% (Fig. 4B). ML090 also interfered with the Amplex Red signal, yet lowering it by 11.9%

298

(Fig. 4E); the NOX5 dependent signal, however, was reduced by 46.8 % (Fig. 3E). Therapeutically,

299

ML090 protects from vascular dysfunction in a rabbit model, an effect that has been attributed to

300

NOX1 inhibition [44]. According to our here presented data, however, an effect involving NOX4

301

and, in particular, NOX5 cannot be excluded as rabbits, unlike mice and rats, do express this

302

isoform.

303

Compared to all compounds, GKT136901, a chemical analogue and pharmacological sibling

304

of the clinically most advanced NOX inhibitor, GKT831, and claimed to be NOX1 and NOX4

305

specific, stood out in a problematic manner. GKT136901interfered both with the Amplex Red

306

assay, for NOX4 and 5, and the luminol assay, for NOX1, and, on top of this, directly scavenged

307

ROS. This latter antioxidant effect has been observed also by others using an alternative H2O2 assay

308

[45] or by scavenging peroxynitrite [28]. These characteristics thus appear to limit interpretation of

309

results using GKT136901 as a NOX4/5 inhibitor and may cast doubt on the specificity with respect

310

to NOX of the entire GKT compound family in general.

311

Similarly, the phenothiazine derivative, ML171, which had been published as NOX1

312

specific [46] and beneficial effects in models of hypertension [47], diabetes [48] and cancer [49],

313

showed assay interferences with both Amplex Red and the luminol assay in line with a previous

14

314

observation [50] that phenothiazines are peroxidase substrates [51]. Nevertheless, the NOX1-

315

dependent chemiluminescence signal was inhibited to a larger extend than the assay interference.

316

Thus, results from the detection of NOX-derived ROS need careful interpretation and

317

several controls as most of probes and inhibitors are prone to artifacts (see als review in [52]).

318

Facing these individual compound limitations, we moved to a NOX inhibitor panel used at IC50

319

concentrations for to test whether they would allow pharmacological target validation of a specific

320

NOX isoform. Indeed, using this approach our observation that GKT136901, ML171 and M13 were

321

neuroprotective, but ML090 and VAS2870 were not, suggested NOX4 as responsible isoform,

322

which had previously been established genetically [15]. Thus, the method is inhibitor panel

323

approach in principle feasible for pharmacological target validation.

324

In summary, all tested NOX inhibitor compounds displayed different isoform selectivity

325

profiles suggesting differential chemical targeting and a proof-of-principle that NOX isoform

326

selective small molecule inhibition will become possible. This should stimulate focused library

327

synthesis and structure-activity programs for further lead optimization to obtain truly isoform

328

selective small molecules for single compound target validation and potential for clinical

329

development. For now, we provide an immediately applicable inhibitor panel approach that allows

330

target validation of NOXs under conditions where gene knock-out or knock-in are not feasible or,

331

because of compensation mechanism, not desirable.

Figure 1: RT-qPCR of NOX isoforms mRNA expression in HEK293 and HL-60 cells.

472

NOX isoforms mRNA levels were normalized to the expression of β-actin. To check whether assay

473

reagents interfere with NOXs gene expression, HEK293 cells transfected with NOX1 (T-N1) were

474

treated with luminol (Lum), HL-60 cells were treated with cytochrome C (Cyt c) and HEK293 cells

475

transfected with NOX4 (T-N4) or NOX5 (T-N5) were treated with Amplex Red (AR). A) mRNA

476

levels of NOX1. B) mRNA levels of NOX2. C) mRNA levels of NOX4. D) mRNA levels of

477

NOX5. Data are presented as the mean±SEM of three experiments. VT, vector-transfected

Figure 3: NOX inhibitors display isoform selectivity. ROS production was assessed in

484

whole cells using assays measuring superoxide production by NOX1 (luminol assay) or NOX2

485

(cytochrome C assay) and H2O2 production by NOX4 or NOX5 (Amplex Red assay). As illustrated

486

in the figure (A-E), GKT136901 (A), ML171 (B), VAS2870 (C), M13 (D) or ML090 (E) inhibited

487

ROS production with NOX isoform selective IC50. Data are presented as the mean±SEM of three

488

experiments.

Figure 4: NOX inhibitors display interference with ROS assays. A/B) To study possible

491

interference of GKT136901, ML171, VAS2870, M13 or ML090 with luminol-based measurements

492

cell-free luminol assays were used. In these assays, ROS production generated by X/XO was

493

enhanced by M13 (A) but not by GKT136901, ML171, VAS2870 or ML090. Moreover,

494

chemiluminescence produced by luminol only was inhibited by ML171 and VAS2870, enhanced by

ML090 and not affected by GKT136901 or M13, respectively (B). C) Possible assay interference

496

by NOX2-specific VAS2870 was assessed by studying cytochrome C reduction in presence of

497

X/XO-derived ROS in a cell-free system. Presence of VAS2870 slightly, but significantly reduced

498

chemiluminescence. D/E) The possibility of interference between GKT136901, ML171, VAS2870,

499

M13 or ML090 and Amplex Red-based assays was studied using cell-free Amplex Red assays. In

500

these assays, Fluorescence generated by H2O2 was significantly inhibited by GKT136901 (D) but

501

not by ML171, VAS2870, M13 or ML090 (D). Moreover, fluorescence produced by Amplex Red

502

only was inhibited by GKT136901, ML171, M13 and ML090 while it was enhanced by VAS2870

503

(E). Data are presented as the mean±SEM of three experiments. * P < 0.05.

506

A/B) HCMECs were subjected to 6hrs hypoxia followed by 24hrs re-oxygenation during which

507

inhibitors were present. Cell permeability was subsequently assessed by measuring Evans Blue

508

(EB) fluorescence. C) Hypoxia caused hyperpermeability (open bar) which was significantly

509

reduced in cells treated with ML171 (0.1 μM), GKT136901 (0.1 μM) or M13 (0.2 μM) while

510

VAS2870 (0.6 μM) or ML090 (0.01 μM) treatment had no effect. Data are presented as the

511

mean±SEM of 4-6 experiments; * P < 0.05.
