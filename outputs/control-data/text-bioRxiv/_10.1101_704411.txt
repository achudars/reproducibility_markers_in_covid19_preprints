Abstract
With ongoing environmental change, it is important to understand ecosystem responses to
multiple perturbations over long time scales at in situ conditions. Here, we investigated the
individual and combined effects of 18 years of warming and enhanced nitrogen and sulfate
deposition on peat microbial communities in a nutrient-poor boreal mire. The three
perturbations individually affected prokaryotic community composition, where nitrogen
addition had the most pronounced effect, and its combination with the other perturbations led
to additive effects. The functional potential of the community, characterized by shotgun
metagenomics, was strongly affected by the interactive effects in the combined treatments.
The responses in composition were also partly reflected in the functional gene repertoire and
in altered carbon turnover, i.e. an increase of methane production rates as a result of nitrogen
addition and a decrease with warming. Long-term nitrogen addition and warming-induced
changes caused a shift from Sphagnum-dominated plant communities to vascular plant
dominance, which likely transact with many of the observed microbial responses. We
conclude that simultaneous perturbations do not always lead to synergistic effects, but can
also counteract and even neutralize one another, and thus must be studied in combination
when attempting to predict future characteristics and services of peatland ecosystems.

Introduction

49

Despite key roles of microbial communities in controlling carbon and nutrient dynamics

50

within ecosystems, few studies have addressed effects of multiple drivers (e.g. anthropogenic

51

stressors) on microbial taxonomic diversity and the associated genome-encoded traits

52

underpinning realized ecosystem services (cf. Castro et al. 2010, Li et al. 2013, Andresen et

53

al. 2014, Shen et al. 2014, Contosta et al. 2015). Given the multitude of human-derived

54

disturbances, including climate change and atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic

55

emissions, it is important to understand microbial community responses to multiple and

56

parallel changes in the environment. Microorganisms will potentially react to such external

57

impacts by shifting their community composition and function. This may lead to ecosystem

58

structure repercussions causing feedbacks on e.g. the climate system via changes in

59

greenhouse gas turnover and other ecosystem-scale processes. However, altered ecosystem

60

services resulting from microbial community shifts may also be attenuated by functional

61

redundancy within the community, assuming that many species are able to mediate the same

62

functions in the ecosystem (Lawton & Brown 1993, Nielsen et al. 2011, Tully et al. 2018).

63

Microbial metabolism is central for most ecosystem services due to its central role in the

64

turnover of essential nutrients and biogeochemical cycles (Martiny et al. 2015). For example,

65

changes in the abundance of key microbial taxa able to produce or oxidize methane will

66

influence the rate of methane emissions from various ecosystems that feature relevant redox

67

conditions (McCalley et al. 2014). It is now tractable to characterize such genome-encoded

68

functional traits with community-scale metagenome sequencing.

69

In situ manipulation experiments are well suited to test the responses of ecosystems and

70

their microbial communities to various disturbance scenarios. Except for long-running trials

71

in agricultural and forestry systems (Ramirez et al. 2010, Fierer et al. 2012, Leff et al. 2015,

72

Zhou et al. 2015, Boot et al. 2016, Zeng et al. 2016), generally, in situ manipulations of soil

73

ecosystems have mainly been conducted over short- to intermediate-length time periods, e.g.

74

between 1 to 5 years. Thus, several such short time field studies on effects of nitrogen

75

amendment and warming on diversity, function and abundance of microbial communities

76

have been reported (Castro et al. 2010, Li et al. 2013, Andresen et al. 2014, Shen et al. 2014,

77

Contosta et al. 2015). Yet, to identify environmental responses over ecologically relevant

78

timescales, while at the same time accounting for short-term disturbance effects, long-term (at

79

least decadal) field experiments are needed (Rinnan et al. 2007, Eriksson et al. 2010a,

80

Contosta et al. 2015). Moreover, as all ecosystems are influenced by multiple stressors, we

81

need to understand how interactive effects of multiple effectors (synergistic or antagonistic

82

perturbations) influence microbial communities if we are to robustly predict ecosystem

83

responses to global warming, changes in atmospheric nutrient deposition and anthropogenic

84

pollution in general.

85

Ever since the last de-glaciation, northern peatlands have played an important role in the

86

global carbon balance, and are currently estimated to hold 30% of the global soil carbon, i.e.

87

carbon stocks estimated at 270 - 600 Pg of organic C (Gorham 1991, Turunen et al. 2002, Yu

88

2012). Due to slow rates of microbial decomposition, there is an imbalance between primary

89

production and degradation in these ecosystems. Thus, undisturbed peatlands are generally

90

contemporary net sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2), while at the same time being significant

91

sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere (Roulet et al. 2007, Nilsson et al. 2008, Turetsky

92

et al. 2014). Therefore, the impact of the predicted global climate change and atmospheric

93

nitrogen (N) and sulfate (S) deposition on the peatland net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)

94

is a topic of major concern (Granberg et al. 2001, Galloway et al. 2004, Gauci et al. 2004,

95

Phoenix et al. 2012).

96
97

Increased N availability is known to strongly affect plant species composition and
performance of different plant functional types in peatlands (Damman 1988, Bridgham et al.

98

1996, Eppinga et al. 2010, Limpens et al. 2011) as N is often a limiting nutrient (Wang &

99

Moore 2014). This is clearly demonstrated by the shift towards vascular plant-dominated

100

vegetation in the long-term high N deposition experiment at Degerö Stormyr (Wiedermann et

101

al. 2007, Eriksson et al. 2010a, Eriksson et al. 2010b). As a result, methane emissions

102

increased in response to the enhanced N deposition (Eriksson et al. 2010b), whereas warming

103

led to a decrease in methane production, oxidation and emissions (Eriksson et al. 2010a,

104

Eriksson et al. 2010b).

105

It has been argued that novel mechanistic insights on biogeochemical dynamics can be

106

obtained by studying peat microbial community composition and function, and that such

107

information can further improve predictions of ecosystem responses to global change

108

(Bragazza et al. 2015). To investigate the isolated and interactive effects of warming, N and S

109

deposition on the peat microbial community and function, we applied high throughput

110

sequencing approaches to peat samples collected after 18 years of continuous in situ field

111

manipulation. We took advantage of a full factorial experimental design that was established

112

at Degerö Stormyr in 1995, consisting of nitrogen (NH4NO3) and sulfate (Na2SO4)

113

amendments and warming (plots scale green-house covers) simulating the predicted effect of

114

climate change (Granberg et al. 2001). Overall, simulated increased N deposition had the

115

most pronounced effect on bacterial as well as archaeal communities. Multiple stressors

116

interacted to give responses at the level of taxonomic and functional diversity, which

117

influenced the functional potential of the ecosystem with regards to methane production,

118

sulfate reduction, nitrate reduction and polymer hydrolysis. Thus, our experiment emphasizes

119

the need to study the effects of climate change on microbial communities in the context of

120

multiple environmental changes and anthropogenic-induced perturbations.

Site description and peat samples collection

124

Peat samples were collected from a full factorial experimental design in a Sphagnum-

125

dominated oligotrophic area at Degerö Stormyr, in North Sweden (64°11’N, 19°33’E, altitude

126

270 m above sea level). Briefly, the experimental site is a boreal oligotrophic minerogenic

127

mire, with a surface water pH of ~4.5. The climate of the reference period (1961-1990) was

128

characterized by a mean annual precipitation of 523 mm, a mean annual temperature of 1.2°C,

129

and a mean July and January temperatures of 14.7°C and -12.4°C, respectively. Average

130

weather conditions during 2001-2012 were as follows (Peichl et al. 2014): annual and

131

growing season air temperatures 2.3°C and 11°C, respectively, annual and growing season

132

precipitation of 666 and 395 mm, respectively, and the growing season mean water table level

133

at 14 cm below peat surface. The dominant vascular plants are Eriophorum vaginatum (L),

134

Andromeda polifolia (L). and Vaccinium oxycoccos (L.). The dominant moss species are

135

Sphagnum balticum (Russ) C. Jens. and, S. lindberghii (Schimp). The experiment was

136

established in 1995 (Granberg et al. 2001) and was conducted according to a full factorial

137

experimental design including two levels of nitrogen (N) i.e. ambient (low-level) at 2 kg N ha-

138

1

139

yr-1, two levels of sulfur (S) i.e. ambient at 3 kg S ha-1 yr-1, and amendment of Na2SO4 to a

140

level of 20 kg S ha-1 yr-1, and two levels of greenhouse (GH) treatment, i.e. high level GH

141

with a transparent cover or ambient (low level) of GH i.e. without a cover. Each experimental

142

combination was performed in duplicate. The elevated levels of N and S correspond to the

143

annual deposition amounts in southwest Sweden at the time for the start of the experiment.

144

For a detailed description of the site and experimental design see Granberg et al. (2001), and

145

for details on treatment effects on vegetation composition see Wiedermann et al. (2007). One

146

peat core (0-40cm) was collected from each field plot (n=16) on August 14th and 15th 2013.

147

From each core, 5 cm3 of peat were subsampled at five depths from below the Sphagnum

yr-1 and amendment (high-level) of NH4NO3 to reach a deposition at a level of 30 kg N ha-1

surface: 7-11 cm (A), 11-15 cm (B), 15-19 cm (C), 19-23 cm (D) and 23-27 cm (E). The

149

samples were stored in 50 mL sterile tubes containing 2 mL of LifeGuardTM Soil Preservation

150

Solution (MoBio Laboratories, Hameenlinna, Finland), and kept at room temperature (<20°C)

151

for at most 24 hours before freezing at -20°C.

153

Sample preparation

154

Before extraction, peat samples were thawed over night at 4°C and centrifuged at 2500 x g for

155

5 min. Total RNA and DNA were co-isolated from 2 g wet peat and recovered in 50 µl using

156

the RNA PowerSoil® Total RNA Isolation Kit together with the RNA PowerSoil® DNA

157

Elution Accessory Kit (MoBio Laboratories), according to manufacturer’s instructions.

158

Extract concentrations were measured with the Quant-iT RNA HS assay and the Quant-iT

159

dsDNA HS assay kits together with the Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, Lidingö, Sweden). The

160

RNA and DNA extraction yields ranged 2.5 - 122 ng µl-1 and 0.5 - 600 ng µl-1, respectively.

161

Two extractions from each sample were performed and combined after extraction. RNA

162

combined extractions were concentrated using the RNA Clean & Concentrator™-25 (Zymo

163

Research, Taby, Sweden), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was

164

concentrated by the use of a Vacufuge® vacuum concentrator 5301 (Eppendorf, Horsholm,

165

Denmark). DNA residues were removed from the concentrated RNA extracts by digestion

166

using 2U TURBO DNase (Ambion-Life Technologies, Stockholm, Sweden) for 1 h at 37°C

167

and according to manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed adding 2

168

µl of DNAse-treated RNA to 17 µl reaction mixture containing 1X Expand Reverse

169

Transcriptase Buffer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 10mM of Dithiothreitol

170

(DTT) solution (Roche diagnostics), 5 mM of dNTPs (New England BioLabs Inc., Glostrup,

171

Denmark) and 250 nM of random hexamers (TAG Copenhagen A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark).

173

researchBio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), 1 µl of Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche

174

Diagnostics) was added to the mixture and incubated at 42°C for 40 min followed by 30 min

175

at 50°C and 15 min at 72°C. RNA template addition was in the range of 8 – 300 ng.

176
177

Amplicon sequencing and sequences analysis

178

PCR amplification of the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA and 16S rRNA gene V4 region

179

fragment was performed using the primer pair 515F/806R (Caporaso et al. 2012) for all

180

samples (Table S1). The primers used for amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were

181

selected following the Earth Microbiome Project recommendation

182

(http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/) representing the best choice at the

183

initiation of the study. The primer 806R was previously modified to cover most available

184

sequences in Genbank by Sundberg et al. (2013). More recently, these primers have been

185

shown to be biased against Crenarcheota (Hugerth et al. 2014). Three µl of template (cDNA

186

or DNA) were added to a 20 µl-reaction mixture, consisting of 1X AccuPrime PCR Buffer II

187

(Invitrogen), 0.2 U of AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) and 500

188

nM of each primer. The PCR assay was performed in a DNA engine DYADTM Peltier

189

Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with the following conditions: 94°C for 2 min,

190

followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 56°C for 30 s and 68°C for 40 s, and a final extension

191

at 68°C for 5 min. PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel. A second PCR using

192

the same primers including adapters and indexes was performed under the same conditions as

193

the previous PCR with the number of cycles reduced to 15. PCR amplicons were purified

194

using Agencourt AMPure XP (Agencourt Bioscience Corporation, MA, USA) and

195

concentration was measured using PicoGreen assay according to manufacturer’s protocol

196

(Invitrogen). To ensure equal representation of each sample, 50 ng of each 16S rRNA and

197

rRNA gene purified sample amplicons were pooled together before sequencing. Then the

198

pooled mixture was purified and concentrated using the DNA Clean & Concentrator™-5

199

(Zymo Research) followed by quantification with the Quant-iT dsDNA HS assay kit and the

200

Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen). A paired-end 250-bp sequencing run was performed using the

201

Illumina MiSeq instrument according to the MiSeqTM Reagent Kit v2 Preparation Guide

202

(Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

203

Raw read data was processed using the ILLUMITAG pipeline (Sinclair et al. 2015). In

204

short, the read pairs from the 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA were demultiplexed and joined

205

using the PANDAseq software v2.4 (Masella et al. 2012). Next, assembled reads (from here

206

referred to as “reads”) that did not have the correct primer sequences at the start and end of

207

their sequences were discarded. Reads were then filtered based on their PHRED scores.

208

Chimera removal and OTU (operational taxonomic unit) clustering at 1% sequence

209

dissimilarity was performed by pooling all reads from all samples (but separately for genomic

210

16S rRNA and 16S rRNA) together and applying the UPARSE algorithm v7.0.1001 (Edgar

211

2013). Here, any OTU containing less than two reads was discarded. Each OTU was

212

subsequently taxonomically classified by operating a similarity search against the SILVAmod

213

databases and employing the CREST assignment resource (Lanzen et al. 2012). Finally,

214

plastid and mitochondrial OTUs were removed.

215

We obtained a total of 4 965 761 sequence reads (including both, the 16S rRNA and 16S

216

rRNA gene), from which 4 811 127 sequences belonged to the domain Bacteria and 15 444 to

217

the domain Archaea. Bacterial and archaeal sequences were analysed together as the

218

combined prokaryote community. Prior to estimating alpha diversity, to minimize the impact

219

of varying sequencing depth among the samples, the reads were rarefied to 5315 and 5455

220

sequences per sample for RNA and DNA, respectively. Three RNA and 2 DNA samples were

221

excluded due to low number of sequences (Table S1). Prokaryote richness and evenness

222

(alpha diversity) were estimated using the Chao1 and Pileou’s indices, where a Pielou index

223

of 1 represents absolute evenness. Prior to beta-diversity analyses and to avoid excluding

224

samples, the number of reads for individual samples were rarefied to the minimum number of

225

sequences observed per sample: 3331 and 3348 sequences for 16S rRNA and the 16S rRNA

226

gene, respectively.

227
228

Shotgun metagenome sequencing, assembly and annotation

229

Shotgun sequencing was performed on samples from depths B (11-15 cm) and D (19-23 cm),

230

(Table S1). Depth B corresponds to the level around which the mean growing season water

231

table occurs, which is the depth horizon with the most metabolic activity. Depth D is below

232

the growing season water table level fluctuations and, thus, continuously anoxic. 1ng of each

233

DNA sample (from B and D depths) were used for tagmentation using the Nextera XT

234

(Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Tagmented

235

samples were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Agencourt Bioscience Corporation,

236

MA, USA). Purified samples were visualized on a 1% agarose gel to ensure the libraries range

237

was within 300-1000 bp. Libraries concentrations were measured with Quant-iT dsDNA HS

238

assay and the Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen). To ensure equal representation of each sample,

239

10 ng of each sample library were pooled together before sequencing. A paired-end 150-bp

240

sequencing run was performed using the Illumina Rapid Run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500

241

platform (Illumina, Denmark), according to manufacturer’s instructions.

242

The obtained reads were quality-trimmed using Sickle (Joshi & Fass 2011), and all

243

samples were co-assembled with a range of k-mer values (from 31 to 101 with increments of

244

10) using Ray (Boisvert et al. 2012). The resulting assemblies were subsequently fragmented

245

in silico into successive sequences of 2000 base pairs overlapping by 1900 bp and were then

246

merged using 454 Life Sciences's software Newbler (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) as

247

previously described (Hugerth et al. 2015). The clean reads of all samples were mapped to the

248

merged assembly using Bowtie (Langmead & Salzberg 2012) after processing with SAMtools

249

(Li et al. 2009). Duplicates were removed using Picard (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA,

250

USA). Finally, coverage was computed using BEDTools (Quinlan & Hall 2010). PFAM

251

(protein families) annotation was performed using HMMer (Eddy 2011) using the PFAM A

252

database (Finn et al. 2014). For each sample, the coverage of all detected PFAMs was

253

normalized by dividing it by the mean coverage of a set single copy PFAMs (Rinke et al.

254

2013) in order to compile the coverage in a “per genome equivalent” form. PFAM tables

255

standardized to genome equivalents were resampled by removing PFAMs with smaller

256

genome equivalents than the highest minimum genome equivalent (6.9x10-4) of sample

257

NxGH.

258
259

Statistical analyses

260

The multifactorial experiment consists of three treatment factors at two levels (23-design) with

261

field duplicates for each treatment. Thus, the statistical evaluation is based on n=8 for the

262

main factors N, S and GH and n=4 for the 2-way interaction treatments (NxS, NxGH and

263

SxGH) and n=2 for the 3-way interaction (NxSxGH), see Table S2 for the treatment effect

264

evaluation matrix. After 10 years of treatment, the addition of N had significantly reduced the

265

distance between the mire surface and the growing season average water table (Eriksson et al.

266

2010b). To account for this gradual change and the inherent variation among the plots, the

267

sampled depths were classified according to their positions relative to the average growing

268

seasonal water table level within each plot as given by (Eriksson et al. 2010a), (Table S3).

269

This resulted in three different depth horizons: an upper layer above the growing season mean

270

water table level, which will be the most oxic of the three (AWT), a layer around the growing

271

season mean water table level (WT) and a third layer below the growing season mean water

272

table level characterized by permanent anoxic conditions (BWT).

273

ANOVA was applied to test for the effects of the treatments on the prokaryotic alpha-

274

diversity. Permutation analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was applied to test the

275

hypothesis that the prokaryotic community composition and its functional potential differed

276

among the treatments. To assess whether the microbial composition turnover in the treatment

277

plots followed the same direction, ordination by non-metric multidimensional scaling was

278

used. In order to understand how the response of the microbial community was distributed

across the different phyla, we used the integrated occurrence of each phylum along the entire

280

peat profiles and calculated the average change in their relative abundance derived from the

281

16S rRNA for the high treatment levels in relation to their corresponding low levels. The

282

phyla were sorted according to their relative abundance in the combined 16S rRNA dataset

283

and are presented with either positive or negative responses to the treatments. In this context,

284

it should be noted that changes at the phylum level might only be a rough representation of

285

changes in the functional capacity of the communities. To assess individual metabolic traits in

286

the different treatments, we applied generalized linear models (GLMs) on genome equivalent

287

standardized PFAMs across the different treatments. We focused on PFAMs predicting key

288

enzymes involved in the anaerobic degradation of soil organic matter, as well as

289

methanotrophy (Table S4). The resulting differentially abundant categories (taxa or functional

290

subsystems) among samples were identified based on p<0.05 and false discovery rate was

291

estimated (Benjamini & Hochberg 1995). A distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA)

292

was applied to explore possible multiple linear correlations between the microbial community

293

composition and the vegetation composition previously reported (Eriksson et al. 2010b).

294

Correspondence between the different data sets was investigated using procrustes

295

superimposition combined with a randomisation test (Peres-Neto & Jackson 2001). Bray-

296

Curtis distance was used when a distance matrix was required applying 999 permutations. The

297

statistic discrimination throughout the analyses was at a significance level of 0.05.

Results

304

Microbial community composition

305

High throughput sequencing data was used to follow prokaryotic community composition and

306

metabolic traits responding to the perturbations in the factorially designed experiment. High

307

concordance was observed between the 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA-derived community

308

compositions, as determined by procrustes superimposition (p = 0.001, R = 0.9; Table S5).

309

Comparisons of treatments revealed that the three main factors (nitrogen (N), sulfate (S) and

310

warming (GH)) significantly affected the prokaryote community compositions (i.e. the beta-

311

diversity; Table 1). In all cases, enhanced inorganic N deposition (high level) significantly

312

affected the community composition at all depth horizons, contributed the most to the

313

explained variance (Table 1), and showed the highest degree in dissimilarity compared to the

314

ambient N (low level) (Fig. 1). In contrast to beta-diversity describing compositional changes

315

(as determined by Bray-Curtis distances), alpha-diversity assessed as prokaryotic richness and

316

evenness estimates, revealed only few significant responses to the perturbations (Table 1).

317

Richness increased with the warming effect, while evenness overall decreased as a result of

318

all the perturbations (Fig. S1).

319

The combined perturbations (i.e. high levels of NxS, NxGH, SxGH and NxSxGH) caused

320

significant interactive effects that shifted the prokaryotic community (i.e. the beta-diversity:

321

Table 1 and Fig. 1). For example, the 16S rRNA gene-derived prokaryotic community (beta-

322

diversity) response to warming increased with enhanced N deposition in the two upper

323

horizons, while enhanced S deposition significantly increased the warming effect below the

324

water table. Such synergistic effects were also observed when combining N and S deposition.

325

While treatment interactions appeared to be additive as based on the observation that the

326

dissimilarity among communities increased when applying multiple perturbations, their

327

directionality were not consistent (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2). This implies that communities

328

experiencing impacts from multiple perturbations do not merely change in a linear fashion

329

based on combinations of individual perturbations, but are emerging in response to the

330

establishment of unique communities for a particular combination of effectors. For example,

331

enhanced N deposition combined with another perturbation (NxS, NxGH and NxSxGH)

332

tended to cause greater community changes compared to the single perturbations at the two

333

upper layers (Fig. 1a and 1b). Below the growing season mean water table (BWT) horizon,

334

the amplitudes of the community composition responses in comparison to the control were

335

similar for all perturbations (Fig. 1c).

336

There was concordance between beta diversity of the plant vegetation, derived from

337

Wiedermann et al. (2007), and the peat prokaryote community at all three depth horizons, as

338

revealed by procrustes superimposition (p = 0.001, R = 0.4 - 0.7; Table S5). In addition, db-

339

RDA analyses revealed that the prokaryotic composition in the treatments receiving NH4NO3

340

(high N) were positively correlated with the relative abundance of the dominant vascular

341

plants (E. vaginatum, A. polifolia and V. oxycoccus) and negatively correlated with total

342

Sphagnum and S. balticum coverage (Fig. S3).

343

Bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences and expressed 16S rRNA sequences

344

were classified into 31 and 33 phyla, respectively. The main phyla were Verrucomicrobia and

345

Acidobacteria accounting respectively for 39% and 26% of the reads in the 16S rRNA gene-

346

derived community, while Acidobacteria accounted for 36% and Proteobacteria for 23% of

347

the reads in the 16S rRNA-derived community. The abundance of the different phyla was

348

clearly and differentially affected by the perturbations (Fig. 2). For example, the phyla

349

Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, and Armatimonadetes decreased in relative abundance in response

350

to all the treatments, while Chlorobi, Euryarchaeota, Fibrocateretes, and Tenericutes showed

351

the opposite response. Verrucomicrobia and Actionabacteria increased in response to the main

352

N effect and decreased in the other treatments, while candidate phylum BD1-5 had the

353

opposite response. Cyanobacteria and Fusobacteria, increased in response to the main

354

warming effect while for all the other treatments decreased and disappeared, respectively.

355

Dictyoglomi increased with N, GH and NxGH while disappeared with all the other

356

treatments. Thaumarchaetoa and candidate division TM7 disappeared with warming while

357

increased with N, S and NxS perturbations.

358
359

Microbial metabolic traits

360

In addition to responses in the composition of operational taxonomic units and taxonomic

361

groups at the phylum level, we assessed the treatment responses with regards to genome-

362

encoded metabolic traits from shotgun metagenomic data. In total, protein-coding genes

363

matching 4957 protein families (PFAMs) were found from the 31 metagenomes. Overall

364

responses in the functional potential as determined by estimating Bray-Curtis distances

365

revealed that only enhanced N deposition (high -N) caused a significant shift in functional

366

attributes, and this was only observed below the water table (Table 1). There was also a

367

significant interactive effect when warming and increased S deposition perturbations were

368

combined (Table 1).

369

Moreover, we specifically searched for marker genes related to key steps in the anaerobic

370

degradation of organic matter (e.g. nitrate- and sulfate reduction, hydrolysis, fermentation,

371

methanogenesis) and aerobic methane and ammonia oxidation (Table S4). From 1057

372

possible responses at each depth horizon, merely 24 significant responses (p<0.05; FDR of

373

0.30) could be extracted from above the growing season mean water table (AWT), while the

374

corresponding number in samples from below the growing season mean water table (BWT)

375

was 30. At the AWT horizon, a few genes encoding for key steps in processes such as

376

methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, nitrate reduction, sulfur oxidation, nitrogen fixation,

377

syntrophy and hydrolysis, responded significantly to the experimental treatments (Fig. 3a).

378

The majority of significant responses were connected to the 2-way interactive terms (NxS,

379

NxGH and SxGH). Marker genes for methanogenesis significantly decreased in response to

380

the main effects (N, S and GH), with amplification effects connected to the NxSxGH

381

interaction, while they increased in response to the 2-way interactive terms. Genes encoding

382

for proteins involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction increased under enhanced S

383

deposition, with amplification effects under the three-way perturbation and a decrease in the

384

response when combined with warming or N.

385

At the BWT horizon, only a few genes encoding for methanogenesis, sulfate reduction,

386

nitrate reduction, sulfur oxidation, syntrophy, and hydrolases responded significantly to the

387

treatments. At this horizon the majority of the responses were connected to warming and

388

enhanced S deposition, both resulting in a decrease of the different metabolic potentials,

389

except for sulfate reduction that increased with the elevated S deposition (Fig. 3b). However,

390

the few significant effects of the 2- and 3-way interactions with S or GH seemed to counteract

391

these responses, resulting in an increase of the respective metabolic traits. For example,

392

marker genes for methanogenesis, as observed for the AWT horizon, significantly decreased

393

in response to the individual S and GH effects but increased in response to the NxS and

394

NxSxGH perturbations. Genes encoding for hydrolases were the most affected among the

395

studied metabolic traits, and mainly decreased with warming and enhanced S deposition as

396

well as with simultaneous increase in N and S depositions.

398

Co-variations between ecosystem functions and genetics in the light of perturbations

399

Taxonomic composition and genome-encoded traits were tightly coupled (p = 0.001, R =

400

0.87; Table S5). The previously reported realized methane production (Eriksson et al. 2010a),

401

and the taxonomic composition data at 16S rRNA level were strongly related to each other

402

across the different treatments and depth horizons (Table 2). However, genome-encoded

403

functional traits as assessed from shotgun metagenomic data, including marker genes for

404

methanogenesis and methanotrophy, did not correspond with measured function (i.e. methane

405

production and oxidation; data no shown).

406
407

Discussion

408

The long field experiment at the Degerö Stormyr peatland was established to investigate the

409

effects of increased nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) deposition as well as warming on methane and

410

carbon dynamics in boreal oligotrophic mires (Granberg et al. 2001). Here we report on

411

interactive long-term effects after 18 years of multiple perturbations on prokaryotic taxonomic

412

diversity and genome-encoded traits, as well as their relationship with ecosystem-scale

413

processes of interest (i.e. methane cycling, organic matter degradation and plant composition).

414

The microbial taxonomic composition largely corresponds with results from previous studies

415

of peatlands (Lin et al. 2012, Serkebaeva et al. 2013, Tveit et al. 2013). Thus, the proportion

416

of archaeal sequences at 0.3% of total prokaryotic sequences was in the range of what has

417

previously been observed for peat ecosystems (Tveit et al. 2013 and references therein). We

418

also show that where vascular plants (E. vaginatum, A. polifolia and V. oxycoccus) replaced

419

Sphagnum under N amendments (Wiedermann et al. 2007, Eriksson et al. 2010b), also

420

prokaryotic communities shifted in composition in response to N additions. The concordance

421

between beta-diversity of the plant vegetation composition derived from Wiedermann et al.

422

(2007) and the composition of the peat prokaryote community, confirms the tight coupling

423

between vegetation and microbes in the peat biome. The enrichments of roots at 10-15 cm

424

into the peat vertical profile (Olid et al. 2017) likely play an essential role for this

425

development by causing changes in organic matter composition and availability. The high

426

level of N induced shifts in relative abundance among many phyla reported to harbour

427

hydrolytic enzymes (Juottonen et al. 2017 and therein), i.e. increases in Proteobacteria and

428

Actinobacteria, while Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes decreased.

429

Interestingly, the decrease in Acidobacteria concomitantly with the relative increase in

430

Proteobacteria may indicate a shift from the naturally nutrient poor conditions in the nutrient

431

poor fen to more nutrient rich conditions because of the N amendment. In agreement with

432

this, Lin et al. (2012) observed a higher abundance of Proteobacteria in rich fens compared to

433

nutrient poor bogs. Since both phyla contain anaerobic carbohydrate polymer degrading

434

representatives, these phyla may replace one another (cf. Schmidt et al. 2015) as result of

435

changes in the type of carbohydrates supplied by the different plant communities forming the

436

peat. The decrease in Cyanobacteria may reflect the decrease in Sphagnum abundance.

437

Cyanobacteria occur in the hyalinic cell of the Sphagna lumena, where they have been shown

438

to perform dinitrogen fixation (cf. Granhall & Selander 1973, Granhall & von Hofsten 1976,

439

Berg et al. 2013). In addition to the taxonomic composition, also the genome-derived

440

functional potential (PFAMs) was related to the composition of the vegetation. As such, our

441

results fit the framework developed in studies of other soils subject to long-term N addition

442

experiments, both with regards to microbial community composition and functional potential

443

(Ramirez et al. 2010, Fierer et al. 2012, Leff et al. 2015, Zhou et al. 2015, Boot et al. 2016,

444

Zeng et al. 2016), including grasslands, agricultural fields, agricultural black soils, and

445

subalpine forests. For these systems, there is a consistent view that the shifts in microbial

446

community composition and their metabolic functionality is due to the soil-plant-microbe

447

interactions driven by N loading.

448

The significant relationships between prokaryotic community composition and methane

449

oxidation and production, further emphasize the role of plant-prokaryotic interactions in

450

regulating methane emissions. This is corroborated by the fact that all N amended to the plots

451

is retained in the organic fraction of the peat (Eriksson 2010). However, responses in the

452

overall set of genes, as well as the specific marker genes for methanogenesis and

453

methanotrophy, did not match the patterns of observed methane production and consumption

454

rates previously reported (Eriksson et al. 2010a). There are multiple possible explanations for

455

the lack of correspondence, including an actual decoupling between gene abundance and their

456

expression (Roling 2007, Freitag & Prosser 2009) or a high variability of the genomic content

457

between individual samples. Also, temporal variation could play a role, as methane processing

458

rates and genetic data were obtained during different years and locations within the treatment

459

plots.

460

Similar to the elevated N deposition, also warming led to changes in prokaryotic

461

community composition, supporting earlier findings of decreased methane production and

462

emission rates while methane oxidation was unaffected (Eriksson et al. 2010a, Eriksson et al.

463

2010b). Thus, the relative abundance of genes involved in methanogenesis decreased in

464

response to warming, while other metabolic traits such as methanotrophy were largely

465

unaffected. The observed decrease in the methanogenic potential may be explained by lower

466

input of easily degradable organic matter to the anoxic zone due to oxygen-exposure in the

467

upper layers with higher temperature (Nilsson & Öquist 2009). Thus, the organic matter will

468

be more recalcitrant when it is transferred into the permanent anoxic layer. In favour of this

469

explanation, there was a decrease in the hydrolytic potential below the water table level

470

pinpointing to a lower degradability of the biopolymers at these strata.

471
472

The enhanced S deposition affected the microbial taxonomic composition at the water table
and the anoxic horizons. Although S amendment in the field did not have any effects on

473

methane emissions, laboratory incubations of the methane producing-layers have shown a

474

decrease in methane production by 55% in response to S amendments (Eriksson et al. 2010a,

475

Eriksson et al. 2010b). This observation is supported by our results that the relative abundance

476

of genes involved in methanogenesis were lower in the S-supplied plots. Below the water

477

table, the observed decrease in hydrolytic and syntrophic potential combined with an increase

478

of sulfate reduction potential, imply that organic matter degradation resulted in lower amounts

479

of metabolic fermentation intermediates and H2 available for methanogenesis.

480

Above the water table, the sulfate reduction potential increased concomitantly with the

481

observed decrease in methanogenic potential as expected from the thermodynamic constraints

482

(Abram & Nedwell 1978, Kristjansson et al. 1982). Some of the sulfide generated in this

483

process is likely emitted to the atmosphere at the prevailing low pH, while experimentally

484

added S over the years has contributed to a 50% larger S-pool under ambient climate and to a

485

~15% larger S-pool when combined with the greenhouse treatment (Granberg et al. 2001,

486

Åkerblom et al. 2013). A re-oxidation of this residual S-pool would result in a continuous

487

supply of oxidized sulfur compounds that would sustain sulfate reduction in these treatments.

488

The increase of the photosynthetic sulfur oxidizers, here represented by the phylum Chlorobi,

489

in response to essentially all perturbations and in particular the S amendments, supports the

490

presence of an internal sulfur cycle (Pester et al. 2010, Pester et al. 2012). Such a sulfur cycle

491

is suggested to be involved in the regulation of the ratio between carbon dioxide to methane

492

formation in peatlands (Pester et al. 2010, Pester et al. 2012).

493

The nitrogen applied has been shown to be completely retained for the duration of the

494

experiment in the form of nitrogenous organic matter (Eriksson 2010). Because of this, the

495

amendment of N to these highly nitrogen-limited systems is not expected to enhance the

496

occurrence of ammonia oxidation, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia or

497

denitrification. This is supported by the lack of any significant response of genes encoding for

19

498

these processes in the N-amended plots. However, the 16S RNA analysis revealed that phyla

499

hosting archaeal nitrifiers were present and increased in the plots with N addition. Especially,

500

the positive response by groups within the Thaumarchaeota that have been shown to oxidize

501

ammonia at very low levels, would potentially supply nitrite in the high-level N treatments.

502

However, any nitrite formed would likely be immediately reduced by means of

503

denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation or assimilative or dissimilative reduction to

504

ammonia.

505
506

Conclusions

507

Experimental long-term treatments mimicking anthropogenic perturbations altered the

508

microbial communities at the taxonomic level and to some extent redistribute genes encoding

509

microbial metabolic profiles including changes in ecosystem-relevant traits, such as sulfate

510

reduction and methanogenesis, partly coinciding with expressed overall ecosystem functions.

511

The results from the 18-years field manipulation experiment emphasizes that interactive

512

effects of multiple anthropogenic perturbations on ecosystem services lead to idiosyncratic

513

and hard to predict disturbance-responses in natural microbial communities when studying

514

each perturbation in isolation. The observed additive effects of the treatments on community

515

composition and function emphasize the need for studying interactions among multiple

516

anthropogenic perturbations to understand ecosystem responses to climate change.

Table 1 Statistical tests for the 16S rRNA gene sequences, 16S rRNA sequences and protein
families derived from the metagenome (PFAM) in relation to the treatments and the
standardized depths: above the growing season water table (AWT), around the growing
season mean water table (WT), and below the growing season mean water table (BWT).
PFAMs were only analysed at the AWT and BWT depths. N, S and GH refer to the main
treatment effects of nitrogen, sulfur and greenhouse, and NxS, NxGH and SxGH refer to their
two-way interactions, while NxSxGH represents the three-way combination. Only R2-values
from the significant results of a permutational multivariate analysis of variance
(PERMANOVA) are presented. Similar for the alpha-diversity, only Pielou (evenness index)
and Chao (richness index) are represented from the significant results of an ANOVA.

Fig. 1 Prokaryote community composition (β-diversity) turnover in relation to the low
treatment levels. a: above the growing season mean water table level. b: around the growing
season mean water table level. c: below the growing season mean water table level. Black:
community composition derived from the 16S rRNA gene. Red: community composition
derived from the 16S rRNA. A Bray-Curtis distance of 0 indicates a complete overlap in
community composition between the high and low treatment levels, while a Bray-Curtis
distance of 1 indicates complete dissimilarity. Note that the scale on the y-axes starts at 0.7.
The number of replicates for the main, two- and three-way interaction effects are 8, 4 and 2,
respectively.

Fig. 2 Relative change in the abundance of the 16S rRNA-derived phyla comparing the
high level and the low level treatments, i.e. the relative abundance of each phylum at the high
level was subtracted by the corresponding value for the low level and then divided with the
low level value. Grey colour shows the phyla that disappeared with the high level treatment
and red colour shows the phyla that appeared with the high level treatment. N, S and GH refer
to the main treatment effects of nitrogen, sulfur and greenhouse, and NxS, NxGH and SxGH
refer to their two-way interactions, while NxSxGH represents the three-way combination.

Fig. 3 Generalized linear models (GLMs) on PFAMs (protein families) related to key steps
in the anaerobic degradation of organic matter or relevant to the N and S cycling, at above the
water table (AWT; panel a) and below the water table (BTW; panel b). The treatment
responses are indicated by the coefficient, showing a decrease or increase in genome
equivalents of each individual key PFAM. Only significant treatments responses are shown.
Interaction terms in the regression models and the relationships among the variables in the
model should be interpreted in as follows: positive coefficient in the case of interactions
indicates a synergistic effect when combining perturbations, while a negative coefficient
indicates an antagonistic effect, which can even lead to no expression of the perturbations.
