Abstract

43

Plant phenotypic plasticity is the ability of plants to express different phenotypes in response to

44

environmental variations. Genetic bases by which phenotypic plasticity affects plant adaptation to

45

environmental change remain largely unknown. In the present study, we characterized 26 forage

46

quality traits in a panel of alfalfa 198 accessions in a field trial under water deficit gradient. The

47

regression analysis revealed that the values of fiber-related traits decreased, while those among

48

energy-related traits increased, as water deficit increased. Genetic loci for forage quality traits were

49

investigated by Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) under different levels of water deficit.

50

Genetic loci associated with forage quality traits were identified and compared. Similar regions were

51

found between energy-related traits when grand means were used for GWAS. Most of the associated

52

markers were identified under water deficit, suggesting genetic mechanisms for forage quality traits

53

were differ between well-watered and water stressed plants. Although GWAS on forage quality have

54

been reported, we are the first to address the genetic factors for forage quality traits under water deficit

55

in autotetraploid alfalfa. The information gained from the present study will be useful for the genetic

56

improvement of alfalfa with enhanced drought/salt tolerance while maintaining forage quality.

Introduction

58

Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), “Queen of the Forages”, is the most productive and highest quality

59

forage crop. Alfalfa quality reflects its potential to produce a desirable animal response and is directly

60

characterized by laboratory measurements of chemical components including protein, fiber and lignin

61

contents, total digestible nutrients, and other calculated parameters such as: relative feed value (RFV),

62

dry matter intake (DMI) potential and relative forage quality (RFQ). Alfalfa quality is important due to

63

its ability to improve animal performance. Fiber contents such as acid detergent fiber (ADF) and

64

neutral detergent fiber (NDF) are important factors affecting rumen function and digestibility of

65

forage. Alfalfa forage contains 35-55% NDF, which contributes ~20-30% of the digestible energy

66

value of alfalfa, the rest coming from non-fiber components (Van Soest, 1982). Relative feed value is

67

a tool that indexes alfalfa quality based on its acid detergent fiber (ADF) and NDF content. The RFV

68

index estimates digestible dry matter (DDM) of the alfalfa from ADF, and calculates the dry matter

69

intake (DMI) potential from NDF. However, RFV has a significant shortcoming because it does not

70

take into account how variations in NDF digestibility affect the energy content or intake potential of

71

alfalfa. Even when harvested at an immature stage, the digestibility of alfalfa fiber can be very

72

different (Goeser and Combs, 2009). In 2004, scientists at the University of Wisconsin designed

73

another index, relative forage quality (RFQ) for estimating forage quality. The RFQ uses fiber

74

digestibility and the total digestible nutrients of the forage to estimate intake (Undersander and Moore,

75

2004). The RFQ index is an improvement over the RFV index as it better reflects the performance on

76

animal fed. The RFQ emphasizes fiber digestibility while RFV uses digestible dry matter intake. The

77

RFV continues to be widely used as an index to assess quality, compare forage varieties, and price

78

forages. However, differences in the digestibility of the fiber fraction can result in a difference in

79

animal performance when forages with a similar RFV index are fed. The RFQ index has been

80

developed to overcome this difference and it takes into account the differences in digestibility of the

81

fiber fraction and can be used to more accurately predict animal performance.

82

Alfalfa forage quality is affected by environmental factors. Irrigation and an arid climate affect

83

nutritive value of alfalfa hay. Environmental factors such as drought and high salinity are frequently

84

occurred in the arid and semi-arid regions and affect plant growth. Plants have developed several

85

mechanisms to cope with these challenges: including adapting themselves to survive in the adverse

86

conditions (stress-tolerance), and/or changing growth habits to avoid stress conditions (stress-

87

avoidance). Stress-tolerant plants have evolved certain adaptive mechanisms such as phenotypic

88

plasticity to achieve different degrees of tolerance. The extent of phenotypic plasticity often involves

89

in genetic basis subjected to selective pressure, and can evolve a mechanism that facilitates adaptation

90

to environmental changes (Schlichting, 1986). It is unclear whether plant phenotypic plasticity is

91

controlled by specific genes or a result of epistatic interaction during the selection of individual traits.

92

However, genetic diversity and heterozygosity enhance adaptability to variable environments. It is

93

important to identify plant functional traits by which plasticity may play a causal role in plant response

94

to global climate change (Gratani, 2004) or year to year weather changes.

95

In the present study, we evaluated 26 forage quality traits in a panel of 198 alfalfa accessions collected

96

from northern America and dryland regions of other countries. The plants were evaluated in the field

97

under three irrigation regimes: well-watered, mild and severe water deficits. To investigate the genetic

98

base of the forage quality, we applied an integrated framework that merges a QTL mapping approach

99

called “genome-wide association studies (GWAS)” with high-throughput genome sequencing

100

methodologies called “genotyping by sequencing (GBS)” to investigate genomic architecture of

101

phenotypic plasticity of alfalfa quality traits under a gradient of water deficits. The ultimate goal is to

102

gain a better understanding on genetic bases by which water deficit affects phenotypic plasticity of

103

forage quality and to identify genetic regions associated with forage quality traits in alfalfa under a

104

deficit irrigation gradient. The identified DNA markers that are significantly associated with the traits

105

will be used for marker-assisted selection and would facilitate breeding for high quality alfalfa

Plant Materials

110

A panel of germplasm composed of 198 alfalfa accessions selected from the USDA-ARS National

111

Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) alfalfa collection was used in this study. Majority of the panel was

112

collected from Northwest regions of US and Canada including Manitoba, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska,

113

Washington, North and South Dakota. British Columbia, and Saskatchewan and the remaining was

114

collected from dry regions of different countries including Afghanistan, Algeria, Bulgaria, China,

115

Germany, India, Lebanon, Oman, Russia, Spain, Turkey, and Yemen.

116

Field experiments

117

Alfalfa accessions were planted on the Roza Farm (GPS point is 46.289391, -119.725428) at the

118

Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center, Washington State University, Prosser WA, in

119

2016. Field experiments used a randomized complete block design. Each block contains 9 plants with

120

15 inch between rows and 10 inch between plants. They were irrigated regularly until the plant size

121

was uniform (day 35-40). Subsequently, the control plants were watered regularly while water deficits

122

were applied to the stressed plants by withholding water during the dry season (June-September).

123

Periodic irrigation was applied as necessary for the mild stress. The exact watering interval was

124

determined during the trial through visual evaluation of wilting of the plants. No water was applied

125

until harvesting for the severe drought stressed plants.

127

A subset of samples from the first cuttings was used for quality analyses. Plant samples were dried in

128

oven at 60oC. They were then ground in Wiley Mill (Thomas Scientific, US) prior to the final grinding

129

in Cyclotec 1093 sampling mill (Foss, Hillerød, Denmark) through a 1 mm screen. Sample powders

130

were loaded and measured by Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS). Spectra were collected

131

by a scanning monochromator (FOSSNIR Systems 6500, Silver Spring, MD, USA) in the spectral

132

range from 400 to 2500 nm. A NIRS Consortium equation 13AH50.2-eqa was used to predict quality

133

factors.

134

Statistical analysis

135

Phenotypic data were subjected to an analysis of variance (ANOVA), testing the variation among

136

accessions for each treatment conditions. To estimate phenotypic plasticity, a plasticity index (PI) was

137

calculated according to Valladares et al., (2000) as follow:

  ௠௔௫  ௠௜௡ /௠௔௫
138

Where ௠௔௫ is the highest value of the treatment average and ௠௜௡ is the lowest value of treatment

139

average for a specific trait in the population.

140

Genotyping by sequencing

141

Genotyping-by-sequencing was carried out as described Elshire et al. 2011). Briefly, DNA extracted

142

from original plants of the association panel was digested by methylation sensitive restriction enzyme,

143

EcoT221. GBS libraries were then prepared with barcode adapters. Libraries were sequenced in the

144

Illumina Hi-Seq2000 instrument using 100-base single-end sequencing with 2 lanes at Cornell

145

University Sequencing facility (Ithaca, NY).

146

After quality check using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), the

147

sequence reads were proceeded using the FreeBayes pipeline adapted for tetraploid alfalfa for

148

genotype calling as described previously (Yu et al. 2017).

149

Genome-wide association analysis

150

The filtered marker data were loaded to TASSEL (Bradbury et al. 2007) for GWAS. A mixed linear

151

model was used for analyzing marker-trait association. The Kinship (K) and Q matrices were used for

152

controlling population structure during association analysis. Marker’s p-value was used to determine

153

the significance of marker-trait association. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was used as a

154

threshold for significant association (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

155

Results

156

Phenotypic variations of forage quality traits

157

The analysis of variance for 26 quality traits was carried out among the panel of germplasm and the

158

result is presented in Table 1. The sum of squares varied from 0.29 in NEL to 130770.31 in RFV. The

159

differences of most of the traits are statistically significant at the probability <0.0001 level. The

160

estimated parameters varied from 0.41 (NEG) to 164.71 (RFV). The differences for the parameter

161

estimates are statistically significant at the probability <0.0001 level for all the traits. Regressions of

162

phenotypic evaluations showed significant effects of water deficit on forage quality (Fig. 1). The

163

values of fiber-related traits, including ADF, aNDF, dNDF30, dNDF48 decreased as water deficit

164

applied (Fig. 1, A1-4). Water deficit also decreased the contents of fat, RUP, IVDDM30 and NDFD48

165

(Fig. 1 B1-4), and slightly decreased TDNL, protein, IVDDM48 and lignin (Fig. 1, C1-4). Whereas,

166

the values for energy-related traits include DM, ME, NEL, TDN, NEM, NEG, DRYMI, RFV, ENE,

167

DDM, NFC and DMI1 increased by water deficit (Fig. 1 D1to F4). Water deficit slightly increased

168

RFQ and ash (Fig. 1, G1-2).

169

Correlation coefficient was also investigated among the quality traits under well-watered and water

170

deficit conditions. Fig. 2 shows the heat maps of correlations among 26 quality traits under well-

171

watered (Fig. 2 A), mild (Fig. 2 B) and severe (Fig. 2 C) water deficits. Overall, negative correlations

172

were found between DM, ADF, aNDF, ash, lignin, RUP and energy-related traits. Whereas crude

173

protein, IVTDMD30/48 were positively correlated with energy traits. Higher correlations were found

174

among energy traits under all water conditions. The correlations between NDFD48, NFC, TDNL and

175

energy traits increased when water deficits applied.

176

Phenotypic plasticities of quality traits

177

Phenotypic plasticity was estimated by calculating the PI for each trait in the given accession under

178

well-watered and water deficit conditions as described in the section of Materials and Methods.

179

Overall, higher PIs were found in water deficit conditions compared to well-watered control except

180

lignin, fat and protein (Fig. 3, Table 2). Within the water stress treatments, higher PIs were found in

181

the mild stress than those in the severe stress for most of the quality traits. Among them, the highest

182

PIs were found in RFQ with 0.55, 0.77 and 0.75 for the control, mild and severe drought conditions,

183

respectively (Table 2, Top). The lowest PIs appeared in DM with 0.02, 0.04 and 0.03 for control, mild

184

and severe drought, respectively (Table 2, bottom). The rest of the traits showed higher PIs in severe

185

drought compared to the mild treatment. The PI values were very similar between DRYMI and aNDF,

186

ENE and NEL, and TDN and ME.

187

Cluster analysis of germplasm using forage quality traits

188

The mean values of 26 forage quality traits were used for cluster analysis. Two large clusters and 14

189

subclusters were classified as showing in Fig. 4. The first large cluster contained 8 subclusters. Most

190

of germplasm in this cluster were collected from cultivars from US and Canada and their quality traits

191

such as crude protein and RFV were relatively higher, so we named it as the higher forage quality

192

cluster (Fig. 4, top cluster). Two checks, Rambler and Saranac, susceptible to salt/drought are in this

193

cluster (Fig. 4, subclusters 5 and 8). The bottom cluster was furtherly classified into 6 subclusters

194

containing germplasm collected worldwide, including old cultivars and landraces with relatively lower

195

forage quality (Fig. 4, bottom cluster). Three salt/drought resistance checks, Malone, Mesa Sirsa and

196

Wilson are in this cluster (Fig. 4 subcluster 9). There was a trend that alfalfa germplasm with

197

resistance to salt/drought had lower forage quality, while higher quality was found in the susceptible

198

alfalfa germplasm.

199

Genome-wide association for forage quality

200

The combinations of the filtered GBS markers and phenotypic data of 26 quality traits were analyzed

201

by GWAS using a mixed linear model. The results of marker-trait association for well-watered control

202

(A), mild (B) and severe (C) water deficits were illustrated in quantile-quantile plots (QQ) (Fig. 5).

203

The QQ plots shows the expected distributions of association test statistics (X-axis) across thousands

204

of SNPs compared to the observed values (Y-axis). Any deviation from the X=Y line implies a

205

consistent difference between expected and observed across the whole genome. In the present study,

206

as showing in Fig. 5, solid lines represent stress treatments match with the expected line until they

207

sharply curve at the end, representing a small number of true associations among majority of

208

unassociated SNPs. The significances of marker-trait association were presented in negative log P-

209

values. Overall, lower significance was obtained in the control (Fig. 5 A) while higher significances

210

were obtained in the stress (Fig. 5 B and C) with highest in the mild stress Fig. 5 B). Significances

211

were only found in TDNL, NDFD48 and ME under well-watered condition (Fig. 5 A), whereas most

212

significances were found in majority of the traits under the mild stress (Fig. 5 B) with highest in

213

dNDF30 and 48. The highest association was found in ash in the severe stress (Fig. 5 C), however, the

214

level of significances was lower by the severe stress compared to that of the mild stress (Fig. 5 B).

215

More detailed profile of marker-trait association is presented in Manhattan plots (Fig. 6). Of 26 traits

216

analyzed, most significant marker-trait associations were found in ash, NDFD48, dNDF30, dNDF48,

217

NFC and TDNL under mild water stress (Fig. 6 B, E, H, K, N and Q). Similar association profiles

218

were found in the severe stress, but the marker’s significances were lower for the same traits (Fig. 6 C,

219

F, I, L, O and R) compared to the mild stress. Whereas no or less significant markers were shown

220

under control and severe stress conditions (Fig. 6 remaining panels). Among those, the highest

221

significant markers were identified in ash and they were located on chromosomes 2, 6, 7 and unknown

222

chromosome (U) (Fig. 6 B). Similarly, Significant markers associate with NDFD48 were also

223

identified on same chromosomes (Fig. 6 E) under mild stress but not in control and severe stress (Fig.

224

6 D and F, respectively). Significant markers were also found in dNDF30 and dNDF48 and they were

225

located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 8 (Fig. 6 H and K, respectively). Mild stress also triggered

226

marker-trait associations in NFC and TDNL (Fig. 6 N and Q, respectively). Significant markers

227

associated with NFC were located on chromosomes 2, 6 and 7 (Fig. 6 N). while markers associated

228

with TDNL were located on chromosomes 2 and 6 (Fig. 6 Q).

229

When phenotypic means were used for marker-trait association, similar association profile was found

230

among DRIMI, DMI1, RFV, and RFQ (Fig. 7.1 A-D), and most significant markers were identified on

231

chromosome 8 and unknown chromosome (Chr. U). Similar profiles were also found among ADF,

232

DDM, TDN, ENE, ME, NEM, NEG and NEL (Fig. 7.1 E-L) and most significant markers were

233

located on chromosome 8 and U. The same was true between DM and moisture (Fig. 7.1 M and N).

234

Although similar association patterns were found between in vitro dry matter digestibility 30h and 48h

235

(IV30 and IV48, respectively), none was statistically significant, neither in IV30 nor in IV48 (Fig. 7.1

236

O and P). Different association profiles were shown among the remaining traits (Fig. 7.2 A-O).

237

Among those, significant markers were found on chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 8 for dNDF48 (Fig. 7.2 C),

238

whereas no significant marker was identified in dNDF30 (Fig. 7.2 B). One significant marker was

239

identified in dNDF48 but its chromosome location was unknown (Fig. 7.2 D). Significant markers

240

were identified on chromosomes 3 and 5 for lignin content (Fig. 7.2 E). A marker was identified for

241

NFC, with unknown chromosome position (Fig. 7.2 F). Seven markers were highly significantly

242

associated with ash and they were located on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 (Fig. 7.2 J). Only one

243

marker on chromosome 4 was significantly associated with fat (Fig. 7.2 K).

244

Common markers identified among multiple quality traits and different treatments

245

Despite different loci identified among quality traits, common marker loci were found among multiple

246

traits (Table 3). Marker S1_110050725 on chromosome 4 identified in CTL for ADF also significantly

247

associated with other 10 traits including DDM, ENE, IVDMD30, IVDMD48, ME, NEG, NEL NEM,

248

Protein and TDN (Table 3, top row). Similarly, markers S1_305729816 for DMI1 in CTL also

249

associated with 6 other traits: IVDMD30, IVDMD48, NDFD48, RFQ, TNDL and protein. Marker

250

S1_231443201 for ADF shared its association with DDM, ENE, ME, NEG, NEL, NEM, TDN and

251

TDNL. Four markers (S1_197238737 - 90) at the same locus on chromosome 6 and unknown marker

252

S1_292679040 identified for ash in the mild stress were also associated with 6 other traits. Markers

253

S1_351118210 and S1_276968305 identified in CTL for IVDMD48 and ash, respectively, were

254

significantly associated with 5 other traits. Marker S1_174013573 identified in the severe stress for

255

DMI1 were also associated with DRYMI, fat, RFQ and RFV. There were eight markers associated ash

256

were also associated with NDFD48, NFC and TDNL (Table 3). There were nine, eighteen and fifty-

257

five markers were shared their associations with three, two and one traits, respectively. The remaining

258

markers were independently associated with one trait (Table 3, bottom part). Most of the high

259

significant markers with lower P-value and higher R2 are among of common markers, suggesting these

260

markers may have major effects on the respective traits. Among those, ten markers were associated

261

with the same three traits (NDFD48, NFC and TDN). The P-values of these markers ranged from

262

4.01E-08 (S1_21394491) to 5.79E-16 (S1_197238737) and the marker’s R2 ranged from 0.22 to 0.38,

263

respectively (Table 3).

264

To oversee the genetic architecture of the population under different treatments, we compared markers

265

significantly associated with CTL, mild and severe drought treatments with those identified using

266

mean values of all treatments. Among 68 markers identified in the control, 17 were also identified in

267

the mean (Fig. 8 A). Of 70 significant markers identified in the mild stress, only 10 were also

268

identified in the mean (Fig. 8 A). Among 67 markers identified in severe drought, 20 were also found

269

in the mean (Fig. 8 A). We have also compared the common markers identified among the three

270

treatments directly. There were 3 common markers between each pair of treatments (Fig. 8 B). Only 2

271

markers were found in all three treatments (Fig. 8 B).

272

Assignment of significant markers to annotated genes

273

Using the flanking sequences of the significant markers, we performed a BLAST search to identify

274

potential candidate genes linked to significant marker loci. Of significant markers identified, 23

275

markers were found to be linked to known genes in the M. truncatula genome Mtv4.2 (Table3). Of

276

those identified under well-watered condition (CTL), marker S1_305729816 and S1_176594850

277

associated with DMI1 were linked to a programmed cell death and hypothetic proteins, respectively.

278

Marker S1_371197359 associated with ash was linked to a reticulon-like protein B2. Two markers

279

(S1_153379823 and S1_ 153379823) located at the same locus associated with NFC was linked to

280

cadmium/zinc transporting ATPase. Of those identified under mild water deficit, many markers were

281

associated with ash. Among them, marker S1_292679040 was linked to cytochrome P450 family

282

protein; marker S1_300540244 was linked to UDP-glucosyltransferase; S1_311409163 was linked to

283

exostosin; S1_62932631 was linked to helix loop helix DNA-binding domain protein; S1_309228882

284

was linked to carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; S1_130145842 was linked to RING zinc finger

285

protein; S1_294827153 was linked to auxin-binding protein ABP19a; S1_274178328 was linked to E3

286

ubiquitin protein ligase XBOS32; S1_319319782 was linked to IQ calmodulin-binding motif protein;

287

and S1_380790483 was linked to Feronia receptor-like kinase. Three markers, S1_20593175,

288

S1_368369179 and S1_92116984 associated with dNDF30 and dNDF48 were linked to LRR-

289

receptor-like kinase, HASTY1 and OPT family oligopeptide transporter, respectively. Of those

290

identified under severe water deficit, markers S1_108148173, S1_259198355 and S1_261323300 were

291

linked to TIR-NBS-LRR resistance protein, interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein and

292

peroxidase family protein, respectively. Anther marker S1_310998070 associated with fat was linked

293

to RNA-binding (RRM/RBD/RNP motif) protein.

Discussion

295

Phenotypic variations of forage quality among alfalfa accessions

296

Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) has become popular for use in measuring forage

297

quality factors, since relatively precise results can be obtained fast with a proper NIRS. In the present

298

report, we used NIRS results for 26 forage quality factors including protein, fibers, energy and

299

minerals and performed cluster analysis on phenotypic variations of forage quality among 198 alfalfa

300

accessions. A majority accessions were classified into the higher quality cluster, among those, two

301

drought sensitive varieties were in this cluster. The remaining accessions were grouped into the lower

302

quality cluster where three drought tolerance varieties were in this cluster. There is a trend that

303

drought sensitive varieties have relative higher quality than those with drought tolerance. It suggests

304

that breeding for drought tolerant alfalfa may result quality penalty as the crop diverts energy to

305

implementing drought resistance. Therefore, quality factors should be considered when breeding for

306

abiotic tolerance.

307

Commercial markets are seeking common means for estimating forage quality in terms of its value as

308

a feed for livestock. Currently, RFV is the most popular quality measurement and is accepted by hay

309

buyers. Dairy’s often retest hay and look for NEL, CP and aNDF are excellent indicators of energy,

310

protein and fiber, respectively. In this report, water deficit significantly decreased aNDF and slightly

311

decreased CP but increased NEL (Fig. 1). Relative Feed Value is calculated from ADF an old estimate

312

of digestible dry matter and NDF and estimate of dry matter intake that is still used (Undersander and

313

Moore, 2004). In the present study, we found a high positive correlation (R2=9.405) between RFV

314

and the mean of 26 quality factors (Fig. 9 A). However, the RFV is not a good measurement of NDF

315

digestibility. The RFQ index has been developed to overcome this shortage as it takes into

316

consideration the differences in digestibility of the fiber fraction and can be used to more accurately

317

predict animal performance. We therefore performed correlation analysis between RFQ and the mean

318

of 26quality factors and obtained very high correlation coefficient (R2=0.9946) between them (Fig. 9

319

B). Our results support that the RFQ is more accurate in estimating overall forage quality compared to

320

the RFV. Differences in the digestibility of the fiber fraction can result in a difference in animal

321

performance even if the forages with the same RFV are fed. The RFQ index is an improvement over

322

the RFV index for estimating forage quality as it better reflects the performance of animal fed the

323

forage.

324

On the other hand, neither RFV nor RFQ does not include protein concentration or physical

325

characteristics. Protein and physical characteristics are important factors for evaluating forage quality.

326

To understand the relationships between those factors, in the present study, we analyzed the

327

correlations between protein content and the RFV (Fig. 9 C). Although positive correlations were

328

found between protein and the RFV, the correlation was moderate (R2=0.6827) between them. Similar

329

correlation coefficient (R2=0.6447) was also found between the RFQ and the protein content (data not

330

shown). Therefore, protein and physical characteristics should be evaluated along with RFV and RFQ

331

for a complete assessment of forage quality.

332

Mild drought intends to decrease fiber content and improve digestibility in alfalfa

333

Production of alfalfa for maximum yield and quality requires an understanding of how environmental

334

and cultural factors influence crop growth and development. These factors include growing conditions,

335

stage of maturity at harvest, and climate conditions. Causations exists between the environment, plant

336

response, and nutritive value. In general, yield and forage quality are inversely related. Any factor that

337

retards plant development tends to promote the maintenance of forage quality. If a plant is stressed

338

during growth, a shorter, finer-stemmed, leafier alfalfa is often produced. On the other hand, factors

339

that accelerate growth, such as drought and high temperature, tend to have a negative impact on forage

340

quality. Alfalfa is relatively drought tolerant because its deeper root systems allow alfalfa to absorb

341

deep soil water and quickly recover from drought conditions. However, when transpiration exceeds

342

water absorption, a stress is imposed on the plant influencing metabolism, development, growth, and

343

ultimately yield. Water deficit promotes a reduction in vegetative growth and promote early maturity.

344

It has been suggested that mild drought stress may be beneficial for forage quality as alfalfa as

345

drought-stressed alfalfa will accelerate its shift to reproductive growth (Cassida, 2012). Once a stem

346

has flowered, there will be little additional growth in the stem. Stem internode growth is suppressed,

347

resulting in a greater proportion of leaves on shorter stems. In a short term of drought stress, the

348

greater proportion of leaves in the drought-stressed forage improves feed quality and digestibility.

349

However, if drought stress has been too severe, and for an extended period, plant stress is permanent

350

and may not be recovered.

351

Alfalfa fiber is consisted of three components: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Increasing fiber

352

content of a forage generally decreases its energy content. Of the fiber fractions, cellulose is the major

353

compound digested by the animal while lignin is virtually indigestible in both the rumen and lower

354

intestines. In our study, drought decreased significantly both ADF and NDF, which in turn increased

355

energy-related traits such as TDN, ENE, DDM, NFC, RFV and RFQ (Fig. 1). Drought affects forage

356

quality as cell wall remodeling is a common plant response to abiotic stresses. Biomass composition

357

was drastically altered due to drought stress, with significant reductions in cell wall and cellulose

358

content. Cell wall structural rigidity was also affected by drought conditions, substantially higher

359

cellulose conversion rates were observed upon enzymatic saccharification of drought-treated samples

360

with respect to controls. Both cell wall composition and the extent of cell wall plasticity under drought

361

varied extensively among all genotypes, but only weak correlations were found with the level of

362

drought tolerance, suggesting their independent genetic control.

363

Genetic architecture of forage quality under well-watered and water deficit conditions

364

Among markers associated with forage quality under deferent irrigation episodes, a small number of

365

the markers were in common between well-watered and water deficit conditions, while most of them

366

responded independently to the treatments (Fig. 6), suggesting their independent genetic control.

367

However, when phenotypic mean was used for GWAS, similar association patterns were found

368

amongst energy-related traits, including DDM, TDN, ENE, ME, MEM, NEG and NEL, and traits of

369

DRYMI, DMI1, RPV and RFQ (Fig. 7). The genetic responses to mean values of these traits may

370

suggest common genetic bases among them. This is logical as these traits measure similar forage

371

quality factors.

372

In the GWAS, we only find nine associated markers that have consistent effects across water deficit

373

treatments (Fig. 8B). The rests were differentially associated with respective treatments. Interestingly,

374

about 2 folds of markers were associated with mild water deficit compared to those identified by

375

severe water deficit (Fig. 8B), suggesting that mild water deficit may trigger more genetic responses

376

than the severe stress and the control. Drought tolerance is a complex trait and is affected by genetic

377

and environmental interaction (GxE). This was dominated both at the trait level and for allelic effects

378

of significantly associated causal variants. Therefore, we cannot directly address whether conditionally

379

neutral alleles accumulate genetic variation at a faster rate than constitutively expressed genetic

380

variation. For example, the number of significant markers were significantly reduced when severe

381

water deficit applied compared to mild stress and well-watered control. This may indicate that the

382

plants shut down some metabolic pathways to save energy for drought avoidance under severe drought

383

stress.

384

Putative candidate genes associated with forage quality

385

Among 23 annotated genes associated with forage quality traits, three genes were identified under

386

well-watered condition (Table 3). The programmed cell death (PCD) protein was associated with

387

DMI1, CP, RFQ, TDNL, NDFD48, IVTDMD-30 and -48. PCD in plants is a crucial component of

388

development and defense mechanisms. PCD has multiple functions and regulates a complex molecular

389

network in plant development (For review see Daneva et al., 2016). Its associations with multiple traits

390

in the present study suggested that PCD involved in regulating forage quality in multiple ways.

391

Reticulon-like protein B2 (RTNLB2) was associated with ash and TDNL. It has been reported that the

392

RTNLB2 is located in endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in regulating receptor transport to

393

plasma membrane in Arabidopsis (Lee et al., 2011). Another putative candidate, cadmium/zinc

394

transporting ATPase (cadA) was associated with NFC. The cadA is located in vacuole and involved in

395

cadmium and zinc or cobalt transport and may have a detoxification function through a vacuolar

396

sequestration in Arabidopsis (Mishra et al., 2017). Fourteen genes were identified under mild water

397

deficit (Table 3). Of those, cytochrome P450 (CYP) was associated with ash, dNDF48, NDFD48,

398

NCF and TDNL. P450 family protein is a large enzymatic protein family in plants and play a role in

399

plant development and biotic and abiotic stresses responses (Xu et al., 2015 for review). UDP-

400

glucosyltransferase (UGT) was associated with ash, NDFD48, NFC and TDNL. UGT plays a role in

401

abscisic acid (ABA) homeostasis which regulates the plant response to environmental stresses such as

402

drought cold and salinity (Dong et al., 2014). A RING zinc finger protein (RZFP) was associated with

403

ash, NFC and TDNL under mild water deficit. It has been reported that overexpression of the

404

Arabidopsis, AtRZFP enhanced salt and osmotic tolerance mediated by enhancing ROSs scavenging,

405

maintaining Na+ and K+ homeostasis, adjusting the stomatal aperture to reduce water loss, and

406

accumulating soluble sugars and proline to adjust the osmotic potential (Zang et al., 2016). An E3

407

ubiquitin protein ligase XBOS32 was associated with ash and NFC. There is evidence to suggest that

408

E3 Ub-ligases can control protein turnover by modification of UPS-related proteins and contributes to

409

nuclear proteome plasticity during plant responses to environmental stress signals (Serrano et al.,

410

2018). An IQ calmodulin-binding motif protein was associated with ash. It has been reported that an

411

IQ calmodulin-binding motif protein encoded by a gene of osa-mir369c classified as a small RNA

412

family involved in impacting growth regulation under several environmental stresses such as

413

temperature, drought and salinity in rice (Gao et al. 2010). The identification of calmodulin-binding

414

proteins in the present study supports the assumption that this regulator is important player in response

415

to abiotic stress through the calcium-signaling pathway (Ranty et al., 2006). Five genes were identified

416

under severe water deficit (Table 3). Among them, the TIR-NBS-LRR protein was associated with ash

417

and NFC. The plant TIR-NBS-LRR gene family contains a large class of disease resistance genes

418

(DeYoung and Innes, 2006). The identification of the TIR-NBS-LRR genes in the present study

419

suggests that it also involve in drought response in alfalfa. A similar finding of drought-related role for

420

a NBS-LRR has also been reported in Arabidopsis where overexpression of the NBS–LRR gene

421

ADR1 enhanced drought tolerance (Chini et al., 2004). It has been suggested that a signaling network

422

exists between disease resistance and drought tolerance, and ADR1 may be involved in signal

423

transduction in this network (Chini et al., 2004). An interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein

424

(IIGBP) was associated with ash and NFC. The IIGBP is a GTPase induced by interferon and plays a

425

role in directing inflammasome subtype-specific responses and their consequences for cell-

426

autonomous immunity against a wide variety of microbial pathogens (Kim et al., 2016). A peroxidase

427

family protein was associated with ash and NFC. The peroxidase responses are directly involved in the

428

protection of plant cells against adverse environmental conditions. Several roles have been attributed

429

to plant peroxidases in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. They may have a cell wall cross-linking

430

activity during plant defense mechanisms (Chen et al., 2002). A RNA-binding (RRM/RBD/RNP

431

motif) protein was associated with fat under severe water deficit. RNA-binding proteins (RBP) play

432

important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Recent investigation of plant RBPs

433

demonstrated that, in addition to their role in diverse developmental processes, they are also involved

434

in adaptation of plants to various environmental conditions (Lorkovic, 2009 for review). Although the

435

remaining genes identified under water deficit do not have direct roles in stress responses, they involve

436

in diverse processes in cell developments. For instance, Auxin-binding protein (ABP) was associated

437

with ash, NFC and TDNL under mild water deficit. It has been suggested that ABP1 in Arabidopsis is

438

involved in a broad range of cellular responses to auxin, acting either as the main regulator of the

439

response, such as seen for entry into cell division or, as a fine-tuning device as for the regulation of

440

expression of early auxin response genes (For review, see Tromas et al., 2010).

441

Conclusion

442

In the present study, we evaluated 26 forage quality traits in a panel of 198 alfalfa accessions in the

443

field trial under deficit irrigation gradience: well-watered, mild and severe water deficits. Phenotypic

444

plasticities of forage quality traits were analyzed using the three irrigation treatments. Water deficit

445

decreased fiber contents and enhanced energy-related traits. Higher correlations were found among the

446

energy-related traits and the correlation coefficients increased when water deficit was applied. The

447

highest correlation coefficient was obtained between RFQ and the quality mean, supporting that the

448

RFQ is more accurate in estimating overall forage quality compared to the RFV.

449

Genetic architectures of phenotypic plasticities for 26 forage quality traits were investigated by

450

GWAS under different irrigation treatments. Genetic markers associated with forage quality traits

451

were identified and genetic regions responsive for the respective traits were compared. Similar regions

452

were found between energy-related traits when mean values were used for GWAS. Significant

453

markers associated with forage quality under water deficit were identified with highest significant

454

marker-trait association in the mild stress. Only a small number of markers were commonly associated

455

with all treatments. Most of the associated markers were independent to the different levels of water

456

deficit treatments, suggesting genetic controls for forage quality traits were independent to the stress

457

treatment. Although GWAS on forage quality have been reported, we are the first to address the

458

genetic base of phenotypic plasticity of forage quality traits under water deficit. The information

459

gained from the present study will be useful for the genetic improvement of alfalfa with enhanced

460

drought/salt tolerance while maintaining forage quality.
