Abstract
The development of the gut from endodermal tissue to an organ with multiple distinct
structures and functions occurs over a prolonged time during embryonic days E10.5E14.5 in the mouse. During this process, one major event is innervation of the gut by
enteric neural crest cells (ENCC) to establish the enteric nervous system (ENS). To
understand the molecular processes underpinning gut and ENS development, we
generated RNA-seq profiles from wildtype mouse guts at E10.5, E12.5 and E14.5 from
both sexes. We also generated these profiles from homozygous Ret null embryos, a
model for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), in whom the ENS is absent. These data reveal
four major features: (1) between E10.5 to E14.5 the developmental genetic programs
change from expression of major transcription factors (TF) and its modifiers to genes
controlling tissue (epithelium, muscle, endothelium) specialization; (2) the major effect
of Ret is not only on ENCC differentiation to enteric neurons but also on the enteric
mesenchyme and epithelium; (3) a muscle genetic program exerts significant effects on
ENS development, and (4) sex differences in gut development profiles are minor. The
genetic programs identified, and their changes across development, suggests that both
cell autonomous and non-autonomous factors, and interactions between the different
developing gut tissues, are important for normal ENS development and its disorders.

Significance statement
The mammalian gut is a complex set of tissues formed during development by
orchestrating the timing of expression of many genes. Here we uncover the identity of
these genes, their pathways and how they change during gut organogenesis. We used
RNA-seq profiling in the wildtype mouse gut in both sexes during development (E10.5 E14.5), as well as in a Ret null mouse, a model of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). These
studies have allowed us to expand the universe of genes and developmental processes
that contribute to enteric neuronal innervation and to its dysregulation in disease.

Introduction
Vertebrate organogenesis involves highly regulated and evolutionarily conserved
processes leading to the programmed differentiation of diverse cell types and their
integration into a tissue or organ. The pathways involved are genetically programmed
with genes expressed in precise spatial and temporal patterns and regulated by
feedforward and feedback mechanisms, called gene regulatory networks (GRN) (1, 2).
GRNs are modular, comprised of a small number of sub-circuit classes, conserved
across species, and provide systems-level views of organogenesis (1, 2). They can also
be the genetic basis for developmental disorders (3), as for Hirschsprung disease
(HSCR, congenital aganglionosis), a multifactorial disorder of gastrointestinal
development in which the ENS fails to develop (4).
The mammalian gastrointestinal tract develops from a tube to an organ
comprising at least six well-characterized cell and tissue types (epithelial, smooth
muscle, vascular, neuron, glia and extracellular matrix) that provide its major barrier
function and its integrated physiology involving absorption, secretion and motility (5).
The ontogeny of the gut involves cells that arise step-wise from multiple regimens of
differentiation, being dependent on region-specific interactions between the endodermderived epithelium and the mesoderm-derived mesenchyme. Signaling between these
two layers is critical for the differentiation and apoptosis of both epithelial and
mesenchymal cells, and their subsequent homeostasis. The major developmental event
in completion of early gut development is the migration of neural crest cells (NCC) into
the gut, and their differentiation into enteric neuroblasts (ENCC) and, subsequently,
enteric neurons and glia. These neuroblasts colonize the gut mesenchyme to form two
neuronal networks, the myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus, between the longitudinal and
circular muscles, and, the submucosal (Messner’s) plexus, between the circular muscle
and the submucosal layer. The myenteric and submucoal plexuses provide motor
innervation to both muscular layers of the gut, and, secretomotor innervation of the
mucosa nearest the lumen of the gut, respectively (6).

The many stages of gut development require numerous initiating signaling events
activating TFs targeting diverse genes and pathways varying across development (7, 8).
To improve our understanding of this process, we conducted gene expression profiling
across gut development in wildtype mice. We also examined a mouse model of
Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) which are null homozygotes for Ret (9, 10), the major
gene for this disorder (4). Ret encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) controlling
ENCC differentiation and their migration through the gut mesenchyme. RET signaling is
mediated by binding of a group of soluble proteins of the glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands. RET does not directly bind to its ligand, but
requires an additional co-receptor, one of four GDNF family receptor-α (GFRα)
members (11). Mutations leading to Hirschsprung disease has been reported in many of
these genes, highlighting the importance of this GRN in disease (12). Ret null mice
exhibit complete aganglionosis with transcriptional changes in many of these genes (4),
making it an ideal model to study how development is compromised in HSCR (10, 13) .
Today, comprehensive transcriptome-wide studies allow the creation of a gene
atlas from small amounts of developing embryonic tissue and identification of weakly
expressing transcripts (14-16). Prior microarray studies of wild type and Ret-deficient
mouse guts late in gut development (E15.5) has shown the dysregulation of many
genes consequent to loss of Ret expression, including signaling molecules and TFs
(17). However, we wanted to study the early effects of Ret loss uncompromised by
secondary and downstream consequences. Here, we characterize the gut
developmental ‘parts list’ as a function of developmental time (E10.5, E12.5, E14.5), sex
(male, female) and Ret genotype (wildtype, homozygous null) to characterize its normal
and HSCR genetic programs in development. We focus on the time period when the gut
is differentiating into a mature organ and NCCs are undergoing migration, proliferation
and maturation to ENCCs and enteric neurons (18). We identify bursts of activity of the
activation of specific TFs prior to the differentiation and establishment of each major cell
type and specialized tissue, and therefore its major regulators. We also demonstrate
the dramatic effect of loss of Ret activity, on all major gut cell types. The effect of the gut
mesenchyme on ENS development is well known; in distinction, we now show that loss

of Ret identifies reverse crosstalk on the gut mesenchyme through multiple musclespecific markers including Myogenin. Thus, both cell autonomous and non-autonomous
genetic effects impact the ENS and its disorders. Finally, HSCR has a profound male
sex bias, observed in appropriate mouse models (19), of unknown molecular etiology.
This study shows that the gut transcriptional program is similar in males and females,
with a few genes with specialized functions like cholesterol efflux and inflammatory
response showing higher expression in females. Thus, additional mouse models need
to be studied to understand the sex bias in HSCR.
Results
We performed RNA-seq on dissected whole gut tissue at 3 embryonic stages
during mouse development and assessed gene expression patterns using FPKM
(Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) values. Since there is
no formal FPKM value that defines “expression,” we defined this quantity by qPCR
analysis of selected genes. We randomly selected 7 genes with FPKM values between
0 and 6, at each developmental stage in the wild type male embryonic gut, on the same
RNA samples used for RNA-seq. These results showed that in independent
experiments using 40 qPCR cycles, genes with FPKM < 5 consistently had Ct values >
30 (Figure 1); thus, FPKM >5 was used as the expression threshold. We identified
9,436 and 9,432 genes expressed in the E10.5 wildtype male and female, respectively,
or ~41% of the total transcriptome of 23,235 genes assayed. At subsequent times, only
a small ~3% increase in the numbers of transcribed genes was noted, 10,143 (male)
and 10,180 (females) genes at E12.5, and 10,216 (males) and 10,293 (females) genes
at E14.5. Thus, increased developmental complexity is not associated with large
increases in gene numbers per se.
Relative effects of time, genotype and sex on gut development
In the first analysis, we attempted to identify groups of co-expressed genes
depending on developmental stage, sex and Ret genotype and their interactions. We
used signed network analysis to construct these modules, using Weighted Gene CoExpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) (20) on 9,327 genes with a mean FPKM ≥ 5

across all 36 samples, i.e., 3-time points, 2 sexes, 2 genotypes (Ret wild type and null),
3 replicates. Expression values were transformed to log2(FPKM+1). Our analysis
grouped 7,793 genes into 18 modules (labeled by colors) (Additional Data Table 1).
Next, we tested associations between the first principal component (the eigengene) of
each module’s expression profile with each of five binary variables using linear
regression (genotype, sex and three pairwise developmental time comparisons), under
a Bonferroni correction adjusting for 18 modules (p<0.00277) (Figure 2).
First, we identified a small lightcyan module containing 43 genes (0.55% of all
genes in modules) associated with sex (p=0.001) and four modules comprising 1,092
genes (14% of all genes in modules) associated with genotype: yellow (p=0.0026, 694
genes), pink (p=0.0027, 199 genes), tan (p = 0.0015, 139 genes) and cyan (p= 0.0007,
60 genes). Three modules comprising 1,644 genes (21% of all genes in modules) were
associated with early gene expression (E10.5 versus other time points): brown
(p=0.0002, 1,210 genes), black (p=9.7x10-5, 295 genes) and tan (p=6.18x10-5, 139
genes). Only one module, salmon (p=0.0022, 62 genes, 0.80% of all genes in modules)
was associated with E12.5 (versus others); the later (E14.5 versus others) gene
expression program was characterized by five modules and 5,512 genes (71% of all
genes in modules): turquoise (p=5.2x10-16, 2,208 genes), blue (p=2.7 x10-4, 1,443
genes), brown (p=4.6x10-15, 1,210 genes), red (p=8.8x10-8, 356 genes), and black
(p=1.4x10-5, 295 genes). Note that by virtue of their reciprocal definition the black and
brown modules are associated with both early and late development: the brown/black
module contains genes expressed significantly higher/lower early/late in development.
In quantitative terms, thus, the greatest gene expression changes in gut
development were across developmental time (21% and 71% of genes in early versus
late programs), followed by Ret genotype (14%) together with a miniscule effect of sex
(0.55%). In other words, the developmental parts list is skewed towards later use in
development with differentiation into specialized structures and organ growth; early
development is characterized by a differentiation program necessary to make the
relevant cell types for later use. Thus, to understand the biological roles of these coexpressed genes in the various modules we performed gene ontology (GO) annotation

using DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) (21) and assessed the statistical significance of
the grouped annotated functions at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%.
Genes and pathways associated with developmental time, Ret and sex
Three modules were associated with developmental time. The brown module,
with significantly higher expression in E10.5 versus other times, is enriched for genes
controlling transcriptional modulation (Med24, Med22, Nono etc.), RNA processing
(Crnkl1, Supt6, U2af2 etc.) and transcription factors (Foxo4, Gli3, Sox11, etc.) (Figure
3). In contrast, the black module comprises genes expressed at significantly lower
levels in E10.5 versus other times and whose activities control macromolecule and
protein transport (see below). The tan module also contains genes with weak
expression at E10.5 versus other times: although no functional annotations were
significantly enriched, it includes genes of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (Sfrp5,
Fzd5, Tax1bp3 etc.), transcriptional repressors (Snai2, Limd1 etc.) and negative
regulators of cell proliferation (Ptprj, Raf1, Asph etc.). Thus, transcription and cell
proliferation are the primary processes underlying gut organogenesis at E10.5. At
E12,5, only the salmon module is associated with gene expression and it contains
genes for protein translation (Dnajb11, Pdia6, Pdia4 etc.), protein transport (Tmed4,
Tomm6, Mcfd2 etc.) and genes involved in steroid metabolism and homeostasis (Npc2,
Lamtor1, Ehd1 etc.). Interestingly these processes are still negatively correlated at this
stage of gut development, similar to E10.5 (black module), highlighting the continuity of
function or lack thereof of specific genes during gut development (Figure 3).
Two modules (black and turquoise) were associated with higher and three (red,
blue and brown) with lower gene expression at E14.5, as compared to earlier stages.
Genes in the black module are involved in transport of macromolecules, small
molecules, ions/cellular components (Uqcrfs1, Slc35a3, Gpr89, Hook1 etc.) and
steroid/cholesterol biosynthesis (Cyp51, ACbd3, Sc5d etc.), while turquoise module
genes include those regulating metabolic processes in cell growth (Ide, Ogdh, Fdft1
etc.), as well as transport of macromolecules, small molecules, ions/cellular
components (Slc9a8, Atp1b1, Sec31a etc.) and cell adhesion (Lima1, Ldha, Tln1, etc.).

Thus, these later functions are involved with producing and transporting basic
macromolecules necessary for survival, maturation and growth of the organ (Figure 3).
Genes suppressed during this stage include genes for cell cycle progression (Cks1b,
Cetn3, Bex2 etc), cell division (Spc24, Ccne1, Kif2c etc.), RNA processing (Raly,
Ncbp2, Lsm6 etc.) and translational initiation (Eif3d, Eif4e, Eif3g etc.) from the red
module, and, genes controlling cell cycle progression (Dbf4, Kntc1, Cdc16 etc.), cell
division (Ccnt2, Cdk19, Tsg101 etc.) and DNA repair (Xrcc5, Xrcc2, Setx etc.) from the
blue module (Figure 3). Consequently, at E14.5, cell division is not as rapid as earlier in
development and the tissue is reaching a morphological developmental equilibrium.
Beyond these qualitative changes, we also identified temporal shifts in the
transcription of genes controlling specific gut processes such as cholesterol
homeostasis and protein transport. These features are negatively correlated at E10.5
(black) and E12.5 (salmon) but positively correlated at E14.5 (black, turquoise).
Understanding the roles of this temporal dynamic behavior in gut disorders may be
important.
Gut motility is controlled by the ENS which monitors the state of the lumen and the
gut wall by activating intrinsic reflexes that generate peristaltic movements, change
blood flow, water and electrolyte secretions. The ENS arises from vagal NCCs that
migrate into the foregut and then migrate caudally (18, 22) and then undergo fate
transition first to ENCCs and then to enteric neurons. The receptor tyrosine kinase gene
Ret is the earliest, major and key factor controlling ENCC differentiation, proliferation
and migration. Therefore, it is no surprise that RET is the major gene for HSCR in
humans with both rare coding and polymorphic enhancer variants (23-25). Further, Ret
gene deletions in the mouse recapitulate most of the HSCR phenotype (6, 10, 13).
We identified gene modules that are Ret-genotype, wildtype and null
homozygotes, dependent. Genes associated with the cyan module, with higher gene
expression in Ret null versus wildtype homozygotes, are involved in neural crest cell
differentiation (Edn3, Isl1, Gdnf etc.), enteric neuron differentiation (Hdac5, Gfra1, Isl1
etc.) and transcription factors and activators like Tcf21, Ntf3, Foxf1 etc. (Figure 4A).
These results are consistent with our earlier observations of Gdnf and Gfra1 (4). In
contrast, genes in the yellow module, with higher gene expression in Ret wildtype

versus null homozygotes, comprise those involved in transcription and its modulation
(Zfp335, Med25, Zfp580 etc.) and chromatin modifiers (Ing4, Brd2, L3mbtl2 etc.)
(Figure 4B). Thus, Ret appears to have a significant effect on many early TFs and may
explain why Ret mutations have such severe consequences. The pink module contains
genes weakly expressed in wildtype, as compared to the Ret null homozygote, and
includes genes for cell differentiation (Wnt5a, Srpk2, Rbm45 etc.) and nervous system
development (Sema5a, Itga8, Efna5 etc.). These results show marginal statistical
significance but suggests that certain differentiation and ENS genes may also be
suppressed by Ret highlighting its balancing role in ENS development. Similarly, the
genes in the tan module are also weakly expressed in wildtype and grouped primarily
into broad categories like digestive tract development (Fgfr2, Kit, Lgr4 etc.), negative
regulation of cell proliferation (Sfrp5, Ptprj, Raf1 etc.) and cytoslelekton reorganization
(Pak1, Flna, Parva etc.). But like the pink module all functional groups show nominal
significance.
We identified only one module (lightcyan) of genes significantly associated with
sex, irrespective of genotype and developmental time. This set contains 43 genes
broadly classified into those regulating cholesterol efflux (Apoa2, Apoa1, Apoc1, etc.)
and regulation of peptidase activity (Ambp, Serpina1b, Serpinf2 etc.). Surprisingly, all
showing higher expression in females than males (Figure 4C). Of these only Cited1 is
sex-linked showing that sex-linked dosage effects are not the major reason for these
differences, suggesting hormonal or sex-biased epigenetic effects instead.
The miniscule sex-difference we identified, despite its prominence in
developmental disorders of the gut, such as in HSCR, prompted us to look for such
differences more carefully within each developmental stage. At E10.5, 270 genes show
significant expression differences between wildtype males and females (Figure S1A), of
which 157 and 113 show higher expression in males and females (Additional Data
Table 2), respectively, a skew decidedly increased towards males (P = 0.007).
Annotation analysis using DAVID showed that male enriched factors encoded genes for
cell morphogenesis and cell motility and neurogenesis (Figure S1B). In contrast, the
113 female enriched factors encoded genes for hemostasis, vasculature development

and blood coagulation (Figure S1C). Later at E12.5, 81 and 115 genes show higher
expression in males and females, respectively, but, now, a skew decidedly favoring
females (Figure S1D and Additional Data Table 3), a skew also observed at E14.5
where 133 and 169 show higher expression in males and females, respectively (Figure
S1G and Additional Data Table 4). Interestingly, genes expressed significantly at a
higher level in males are involved in specific morphological functions like neuronal,
musculature and endothelial development (Figure S1B, S1E and S1H) while female
enriched genes control specific physiological processes like response to wound healing,
inflammatory response and response to hormonal stimulus (Figure S1C, S1F and S1I).
Thus, sex differences do occur and occur differentially by functional categories. These
results prompted us to search for genetic programs in gut development by more
focused pairwise analyses of time and Ret genotype.
Gene expression changes during normal gut development over developmental time:
To understand stage-specific gut development we next compared gene expression
changes between early E10.5 (early) versus E14.5 (late) stages in the wild type gut to
discover 2,697 differentially expressed genes (Figure 5A and Additional Data Table
5), of which 1,227 showed significantly higher expression in E10.5. We performed GO
annotation on only the subset of 316 (25.8%) of these genes with 2-fold or greater
expression and identified 89 transcription factors (Bach1, Gata2, Barx1 etc.), 73 genes
for transcriptional control including various transcription factors like Gli3, Hoxc6, Hoxc9
etc. and 29 for morphogenesis (Crabp2, Prrx1, Col2a1etc.) (Figure 5B). Conversely, of
1,470 genes showing significantly higher expression at E14.5, 1,003 genes (68.2%) with
2-fold and greater expression were enriched for biological processes like cell adhesion
(76 genes which include Cldn8, Cldn7, Aebp1 etc.), extracellular matrix organization (20
genes including Olfml2b, Eln, Col3a etc.), regulation of muscle contraction (44 genes
including Myl6, Tbx20, Myh7 etc.) and vasculature development (61 genes including
Cspg4, Anpep, Cav1 etc.) (Figure 5C). These results validate our WGCNA analysis that
early gut morphogenesis is dictated by transcription factors whereas later development
focuses on specifying specialized tissues. This analysis also identified the specific

transcription factors which are candidate genes for genetic disorders of early gut
development (see below).
Ret-dependent gene expression in the gut:
Loss of Ret gene expression in the mouse gut has transcriptional consequences
on many genes in the Ret GRN (4), as observed in our WGCNA analysis, but we sought
to identify additional temporal patterns of gene expression changes triggered by Ret
loss-of-function by detailed pairwise analysis. At E10.5, when Ret is normally expressed
and is the earliest stage where reduction in the numbers of ENCCs and their failure to
migrate can be demonstrated in Ret null homozygote mice (26), we identified 763 genes
with significant expression differences (Figure 6A and Additional Data Table 6), of
which 521 were down-regulated (thus, Ret-activated) and 242 were up-regulated (thus,
Ret-suppressed) in male Ret null embryonic guts as compared to wildtype. The Retactivated genes broadly comprise three biological processes: neuronal development
(Ret’s primary function), transcriptional regulation and pattern specification, primarily
TFs (Figure 6B). In contrast, the Ret-suppressed genes are involved in extracellular
matrix organization and metabolic processes (Figure 6C). At E12.5, there are 353
downregulated and 90 upregulated genes (Figure 6D and Additional Data Table 7),
and, at E14.5, similarly, there are 325 down regulated and 111 up regulated genes
(Figure 6G and Additional Data Table 8) in Ret null versus wildtype male embryos.
The Ret-activated genes at E12.5 are involved in neurogenesis but, surprisingly, also
genes for muscle specification (Figure 6E). This pattern of Ret’s control of gene
expression in non-neuronal tissue in the gut is even more pronounced at E14.5 where
along with the musculature, genes controlling the vasculature are affected (Figure 6H),
while neurogenesis is largely spared. Thus, this pairwise analysis reveals that there is a
gradual shift in the functional classes of genes affected by Ret loss-of-function, from its
known primary role in neurogenesis to its non-autonomous effect on genes in the
surrounding tissue in the developing gut, a feature missed by WGCNA analysis. The
Ret-suppressed genes, in contrast at E12.5 and E14.5 were those primarily involved in
epithelial development and tissue morphogenesis (Figure 6F and 6I) hinting at Ret’s
balancing role in controlling non-neuronal tissue development in the developing gut.

These results show that Ret has a surprisingly broad cell autonomous role within
enteric neurons (26) but even broader non-autonomous roles on the mesenchyme,
through which the ENCCs migrate, and the vasculature, which nourishes the tissues
and the epithelium in the developing gut. These non-neuronal functions are first
observed at E12.5 and persist through E14.5. Further, Ret appears to primarily be a
developmental activator since loss of Ret expression largely leads to transcriptional
down-regulation. Thus, the two major transcriptional programs to emerge from these
analyses are: (1) the predominance of multiple classes of transcription factors early in
gut development gut and their control by Ret; and, (2) Ret’s cell non-autonomous role in
controlling the development of the gut musculature, vasculature and epithelium. To get
a better understanding of these discoveries, we studied them in greater detail.
Transcription factors (TF) in Ret-driven gangliogenesis
One of the cardinal features of gut development is the preponderance of
activities of TFs, chromatin modifiers and genes at E10.5:129 (85 down- and 44 upregulated) TFs show significant expression differences with Ret loss-of-function
(Additional Data Table 9) and are 20% of all TFs active at E10.5 (650 genes) involving
many TF families. Of these, homeobox (41 members) and zinc finger (29 members)
families dominate, of which Gata2 and Sox10 are already known direct activators of Ret
(4), suggesting that others in this class may have similar function. With passing
developmental time, a dramatically smaller and less-biased TF repertoire is affected: 34
TFs (18 down- and 16 up-regulated) at E12.5, and, 28 TFs (12 down- and 16 upregulated) at E14.5 (Additional Data Table 9), primarily belonging to the zinc finger
and T-box containing families. Interestingly, TF use also varies across gut development
with some with various patterns of regulation. Thus, Sox10, Snai1, Tbx2, Tbx3 and
Ascl1 are down-regulated while Foxp1, Foxp2 and Barx1 are up-regulated in in Ret null
embryos through development. The effect of Ret loss-of-function leads to downregulation of Nfat5, Bnc2, Baz2b, Zfhx4 and Plag1 at E10.5 but their up-regulated at
E12.5 and E14.5 in the Ret null. Finally, Peg3 is downregulated in Ret null embryonic

consequences of each TF is thus non-constant through gut development rather than
their presumed canonical use as activators or repressors of transcription.
Among the TFs identified, the Hox family members deserve careful scrutiny. Hox
factors play critical roles in vertebrate body pattering along the anterior-posterior axis
and disruption of these genes are known to have effects on neural tissues, the neural
crest, endodermal and mesodermal derivatives (27-30). Multiple Hox genes are
involved in patterning and morphogenesis of the mouse gut (31), especially genes of
the Hoxd cluster, since their deletion (from Hoxd4 to Hoxd13) leads to loss of the ileocaecal sphincter and abnormalities in the pyloric and anal sphincter regions (32).
Further, deletion of Hoxd1 to Hoxd10 (33) in the mouse leads to agenesis of the
caecum. Almost 50% (20 out of 41) of the homeobox genes affected by loss of Ret at
E10.5 are Hox genes (Additional Data Table 9), including the down-regulation of Hoxd
cluster genes (Hoxd4, Hoxd8, Hoxd9, Hoxd10, Hoxd11, and Hoxd13). Thus, Ret lossof-function, with consequent induced loss of Hoxd gene expression, may be the causal
route to aganglionosis and other gut phenotypes. The literature shows that higher
Hoxa4 expression, driven by ectopic expression in a much broader domain, leads to
megacolon in the mouse from abnormal mesodermal development (34). Interestingly,
Hoxa4 has significantly higher expression in Ret null embryos at E10.5, and is the likely
candidate for megacolon, a major unexplained phenotype of HSCR. These results point
to an expanded role of Ret in the morphogenesis of the gut than previously thought, its
importance in non-ENS phenotypes in HSCR, and, in gastrointestinal disorders
generally.
Non-autonomous effects of the ENS and the mesenchyme
When enteric neurons in the developing gut migrate through the mesenchyme,
their development and activity is dependent on many trophic factors secreted by the
mesenchyme, such as Gdnf, Nrtn and Edn3, well known for their direct effects on ENS
development through their cognate receptors (18). Other factors from the surrounding
epithelium like Shh and Ih also have effects on the ENS since their ablation severely
reduces ENCC numbers (35, 36). Further, in rat models of HSCR, some regions of the

distal colon are constricted with thick muscle and deep epithelial folds while other
regions have thin external muscle with a stretched mucosa (37). This observation is
assumed to be an effect of reduced enteric neuron density on the surrounding tissues,
but could arise from the effects of mesenchymal defects on the ENS.
Clearly ENS defects affect the mesenchyme. Consider that although at E10.5
there is no significant enrichment of a muscle-expressing genetic program, 11 musclespecific genes are significantly down-regulated in Ret null embryos at this early stage
(Tnnc2, Myh3, Myl1, Myog, Acta1, Tnnc1, Mylpf, Myl4, Actc1, Actn2, Mybpc1). By
E12.5, 18 muscle-expressed genes (Myl6, Actc1, Cryab, Tbx2, Tbx5, Tnc, Eln, Myh6,
Tagln2, Tagln3, Tnni1, Tgfb2, Tnnt2, Gpx1, Des, Meox2, Pln, Unc45b) and by E14.5 21
muscle-expressed genes (Myl6, Actc1, Acta1, Cryab, Tbx2, Tnc, Tbx5, Eln, Myh6,
Tagln2, Ttn, Tagln3, Tnni1, Tgfb2, Tnnt2, Gpx1, Myo18b, Des, Meox2, Pln, Unc45b) are
significantly down-regulated in Ret null embryos and are detectably enriched as a class.
The genes affected at E12.5 and E14.5 are near identical, implying a persistent, longterm mesenchymal effect from Ret loss-of-function. We suspected that this muscleexpressing genetic program has feedback on the ENS.
Consider that Myog, a transcription factor so far implicated only in the maturation
of skeletal muscle (38), shows transitory expression at E10.5 in the wildtype gut but is
significantly down-regulated with loss of Ret at E10.5. We postulated that this
expression was specific to smooth muscle cells of the gut. For confirmation, we FACSsorted EGFP-marked smooth muscle cells from the gut of a Mhy11-EGFP transgenic
mouse at E10.5 with EGFP expression driven by a 16kb promoter sequence of the
smooth muscle marker Myh11 (39). Taqman qPCR analysis of RNA extracted from
these sorted cells show that they express Myh11, as expected, but also Myog, albeit
weakly, along with other smooth muscle markers, such as Myl1 and Myh3, confirming
the presence of Myog in early smooth muscle cells of the gut (Figure 7A). We next
asked whether loss of Myog would lead to any ENS defects using the zebrafish, a
model system known to produce aganglionosis under knockdown of Ret and other
HSCR genes (40). Since Myog is expressed at a reduced level and not completely

absent in Ret null guts we simulated this effect in zebrafish using two splice-blocking
morpholinos against the intron 2-exon3 junction of Myog, and marked post-mitotic
neurons in the developing gut with antibodies against neuronal HuC/HuD antigens to
quantify the numbers of neurons (41). At 4 days post fertilization (dfp), with morpholino
1 (MO1), myog morphants showed curved bodies along the anterior-posterior axis, as
expected, a hallmark of skeletal muscle defects. Additionally, they also demonstrated a
severe loss of migratory enteric neurons as compared to embryos injected with control
morpholinos (P=6.5x10-9; Figure 7B). The anterior-posterior axis curvature was much
less pronounced in morpholino 2 (MO2) injected embryos but loss of enteric neuronal
precursors was equally severe (P=7.8x10-9; Figure 7B). Thus, broader defects within
the mesenchyme can also affect the migration of enteric neurons, emphasizing a twoway crosstalk between the ENS and mesenchyme necessary for normal ENS
gangliogenesis.
Discussion
The gastrointestinal tract is evolutionarily one of the most primitive organs in the
animal kingdom and a rudimentary form is seen in Coelenterates. In the mouse and the
human, the gut tube is formed from the primitive endodermal sheet, after a series of
morphogenetic movements, followed by the formation of the muscularis layers and the
submucosal connective tissue from the mesoderm. Finally, neural crest-derived enteric
neural crest cells (ENCC) migrate into the forming foregut to innervate the submucosal
and myenteric plexus as they form throughout the gut tube, moving in a cranio-caudal
manner. In the mouse, this innervation starts at E10.5 and is complete by E14.5, which
is why we chose this period for developmental transcription profiling. After completion of
neurogenesis at E14.5, the gut is still not fully physiologically functional and further
development occurs, including after birth and consequent to feeding. However, these
other time periods are less relevant to understanding human congenital motility
disorders. The studies described here show that the primary feature of the E10.5 to
E14.5 genetic programs is the shift from an early burst of transcription factor gene
expression, indicative of the generation of cellular diversity by differentiation, to protein
translation, indicating the emergence of new functions in these diverse cells, to a wider

muscle, epithelium and endothelial developmental program. These trajectories are
important for identifying candidate genes for various gut disorders and understanding
why certain mutations are more detrimental than others (e.g., occurring earlier than
later).
This study also shows that Ret signaling plays a critical and broad role in gut
development in three major processes: engaging the extensive early regulatory
machinery (TF), initiating ENS development and inducing neuroblast-mesenchymal
interactions. A particularly surprising finding is the feedback effect of Ret on all three of
these processes, some of which are direct and cell-autonomous (e.g., on its own
regulator Sox10) while others are indirect and non-autonomous (e.g., on its ligand Gdnf
or the mesenchymal TF Myog). Thus, the phenotypic consequences of a Ret deficiency
are much broader than its effects on neurogenesis. These findings have three
corollaries. First, HSCR patients should routinely be examined by a clinical geneticist
who are likely to recognize the many additional phenotypic manifestations in HSCR
beyond aganglionosis; indeed, ~32% of HSCR patients have developmental anomalies
beyond aganglionosis (12). Second, the HSCR gene universe is considerably larger
than currently known or assumed, including genes affecting intestinal smooth muscle
and epithelium development. Third, we should not view HSCR as a cell autonomous
disorder of the ENS but a multifactorial disorder of the gut involving different cell types.
These studies also provide two important lessons for the structure and functions
of “systems” guiding organ development, and, therefore, human disease. As first
propounded by Eric Davidson and colleagues (1, 2), development is organized around
modular gene regulatory networks (GRN) that provide robustness to the system by
buffering developmental noise, epigenetic noise and the effects of deleterious
mutations. Thus, we need to convert our gene lists not only by functional annotations
but into GRNs that integrate the genetic and developmental information. These GRNs
are the basic ‘units’ of disease, as we have shown for the RET GRN and HSCR (4).
Second, GRNs can display instability as well when deleterious mutations occur at
certain rate-limiting genes within the GRN and lead to disease by propagating the local

biochemical disruption throughout the GRN, thereby amplifying a mutational effect. We
hypothesize that this feature partially explains why RET is the major gene for HSCR.
One remaining mystery is that despite the major sex effect in HSCR, gut
development is overall not sex-biased. However, a small group of 43 genes show sexdifferences in gene expression, the majority up-regulated in females and involved in
diverse physiological processes. Thus, disruptions in the functions of these genes may
have a larger genetic effect in males than females by virtue of the females’ higher
expression, particularly if expression thresholds are important in development. These
genes should be investigated for mutations in HSCR. Nevertheless, we likely have an
incomplete picture of the nature and magnitude of sex differences in gut development.
The mouse model we used harbors a null allele with no sex difference when
aganglionosis is the measured phenotype (10). In contrast, other mouse models
segregating a Ret null allele with a hypomorphic Ednrb allele do show strong sexdifferences in aganglionosis and segment length (19). Thus, studying other phenotypic
manifestations in mouse models may be important, for example, by quantifying the
numbers and distributions of enteric neurons in the ENS. Finally, the effect of sex on
transcription might not be on the whole gut or the entire ENS but on a specific group of
cells, an aspect which would not be captured in our bulk transcriptomic assays but
require single cell transcription studies.

Materials and Methods
Mouse strains:
Mice heterozygous for the conditional Ret allele (Retfl/+; (42, 43), were obtained
from David Ginty (Harvard University, Boston, MA). Briefly, the floxed Ret locus (Retfl)
was generated by inserting a gene cassette, comprising the floxed human RET9 cDNA
with the SV40 intron polyA sequence followed by a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)
cDNA with polyA sequence, into exon 1 of the mouse Ret gene; this was functionally
equal to the wild-type allele (42). Ret CFP knock-in mice (RetCFP/+) were generated by
crossing Retfl/+ mice to β-actin-Cre mice to remove the RET9 cDNA. This mouse was
backcrossed >20 generation to C57BL/6 to maintain the line and all experiments
conducted in this isogenic strain. The smMHC/Cre/ EGFP mice derived on a C57BL/6
background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME)(39) and were
mantained in this background by repeated backcossing for >20 generations at the time
of the experiments. Briefly a 16kb promoter sequence of the Myh11 gene was used to
drive Cre recombinase and EGFP expression. An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of
the encephalomyocarditis virus was added upstream of the EGFP cDNA to permit
translation of both Cre and EGFP open reading frames from one mRNA. Southern blot
analysis showed a single integration site of the transgene and expression in smooth
muscle tissues of the developing gut (44). All animal research was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine.
Mouse breeding, dissection and genotyping:
Homozygous Ret null mice are neonatal lethals, so Ret heterozygous mice were
intercrossed to generate all possible genotypes. Routine mouse genotyping was
performed by PCR with the following primer pairs and amplicons: for the wildtype Ret
locus, RetF 5’-CAGCGCAGGTCTCTCATCAGTACCGCA -3’ and RetR 5’CAGCTAGCCGCAGCGACCCGGTTC-3’ resulting in a 449bp PCR product (slightly
modified from (45)); for detecting the CFP knock-in we used the primer pairs RetCFP F 5’
ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTT-3’ and RetCFP R 5’CTGGGTGCTCAGGTAGTGGTTGTC-3’ to amplify a 615bp PCR product from RetCFP/+

and RetCFP/CFP embryos. For the Myh11-Cre-EGFP mice we used the primer pairs CreF
5’ ATGTCCAATTTACTGACCG-3’ and CreR 5’ CGCGCCTGAAGATATAGAAG-3’ to
amplify a 241bp amplicon. The sex of the embryos was determined by PCR with the
following primers: Kdm5 forward 5’-CTGAAGCTTTTGGCTTTGAG-3’ and Kdm5 reverse
5’-CCGCTGCCAAATTCTTTGG-3,’ mapping to exons 9 and 10 of the Kdm5c/d genes
and resulting in two 331bp X chromosome-specific bands in females and an additional
301bp Y chromosome-specific band in males (46). Mouse embryos were genotyped
from yolk-sac genomic DNA to allow genotype-specific analyses.
We dissected the complete gut tube at E10.5 and the developing gut from the
stomach to intestine at E12.5 and E14.5 in ice cold Leibovitz's L-15 Medium (Thermo
Fischer Scientific) from wild type and RetCFP/CFP embryos under a fluorescence stereo
zoom microscope (Zeiss AxioZoom.V16) with a suitable filter to detect CFP. The tissues
were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. The smMHC/Cre/
EGFP guts were dissected under a GFP filter before dissociation and cell sorting.
Cell Sorting
Gut tubes from Myh11-Cre-EFFP embryos at E10.5 were dissociated into single
cell using Accumax (Sigma, USA) by repeated pipetting. The cells were filtered serially
through a 100µM and 40µM cell strainer, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The
cell pellet was re-suspended in 5% FBS, 4 mM EDTA in Leibovitz L-15 medium for cell
sorting using MoFlo XDP (BD Biosciences) using a 488nm laser for EFGP.
mRNA sequencing using RNA-seq:
Total RNA was extracted from each of 3 male and 3 female mouse guts at E10.5,
E12.5 and E14.5 from both wildtype and RetCFP/CFP embryos, using TRIzol (Life
Technologies, USA) and cleaned on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, USA). At E10.5, owing
to the small size of the embryos, two each were pooled to create one biological replicate
and three replicates used. Sample integrity (>9 RIN) was assessed using an Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer (AgilentTechnologies) and cDNA were prepared using oligo dT beads
to select mRNA from total RNA followed by heat fragmentation and cDNA synthesis, as
part of the Illumina Tru Seq™ RNA Sample Preparation protocol. The resultant cDNA

was then used for library preparation (end repair, base ‘A’ addition, adapter ligation, and
enrichment) using standard Illumina protocols. Libraries were run on a HiSeq 2000
instrument to a depth of 15 million reads per samples (75 base pair, paired end), using
the manufacturer’s protocols. The primary data were generated and analyzed using the
Broad Institute’s Picard Pipeline, which includes de-multiplexing and data aggregation.
The resultant reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (mm10/GRCm38)
using Tophat2 (47) with its setting for paired end, non-strand specific libraries.
Successfully mapped reads were used to assemble transcripts and estimate their
abundance using Cufflinks 2.2.1 (48). The resultant data assigned Fragments Per
Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) values for each transcript and
gene. The transcript file for each replicate were merged using Cuffmerge and analyzed
by Cuffdiff (48) to detect differentially expressed genes between various comparisons.
For the purpose of this study we considered all genes with FPKM > 5 as expressed. All
RNA-seq data have been deposited into NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are
accessible at GEO Series accession number GSE103070.
Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)
We identified modules of co-expressed genes using the Weighted Gene CoExpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) R package (20). A total of 36 samples were
analyzed comprising 3-time points (E10.5, E12.5, and E14.5), 2 sexes (female, male), 2
Ret genotypes (Ret+/+, RetCFP/CFP) and 3 replicates each. Gene FPKM values were used
for analyses after removing those with low quality in any sample (LOWDATA, HIDATA,
or FAIL). There were 9,327 genes with a mean FPKM ≥ 5 across all samples retained
for clustering, with expression values transformed to log2(FPKM+1).
We used WGCNA to conduct signed network analysis to construct modules of
co-expressed genes, selecting a soft-thresholding power β of 24, the first power with
adjusted R2 > 0.8, to satisfy the assumption of a scale-free topology (20). We used the
“bi-weight mid-correlation” correction method, instead of the Pearson correlation
coefficient, because it has improved performance when outliers are present. We set the
parameter pamRespectsDendro to TRUE, and, to obtain smaller, more numerous
modules, we set the minimum module size to 25 and the deepSplit parameter value to

2. We tested association of each module eigengene, which is the first principal
component and represents the module’s expression profile, with each of five binary
variables using linear regression: genotype (Ret+/+, RetCFP/CFP); sex (males vs. females);
E10.5 vs. non-E10.5; E12.5 vs. non-E12.5; E14.5 vs. non-E14.5. Module associations
with p-values below the Bonferroni-adjusted threshold, accounting for the number of
modules, were considered statistically significant.
Taqman gene expression assays:
Total RNA was extracted from pooled EGFP FACS-sorted cells from the guts of
3 smMHC/Cre/EGFP embryos at E10.5 using TRIzol (Life Technologies, USA) and
cleaned on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, USA). Sample integrity was assessed using an
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (AgilentTechnologies) and 100ng of total RNA was converted
to cDNA using SuperScriptIII reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, USA) and OligodT primers. The total cDNA was subjected to Taqman gene expression analyses (Life
Technologies, USA) using transcript-specific probes and primers. For the whole gut
experiments to titrate the correlation between FPKM and Ct, 500 ng of RNA from each
biological replicate was used to make cDNA. Mouse b-actin (Actb) was used as an
internal loading control for normalization. Each assay was performed in triplicate (n=9
observations per state); the data are presented as means with their standard errors.
Relative fold changes were calculated based on the 2DDCt(threshold cycle) method for
measuring gene expression, the value for the gene with the highest expression (lowest
Ct value) being set to unity. The following mouse Taqman probes were obtained from
Applied Biosystems: Syt6 (Mm00490071_m1), Trpc6 (Mm01151079_m1), Mnx1
(Mm00658300_g1), Tead4 (Mm01189836_m1), Dnajc12(Mm00497038_m1), Plekhb2
(Mm01234649_m1), Cdh23 (Mm04335689_g1), Kif5a (Mm00515265_m1), Angpt4
(Mm00507766_m1), Myh11 (Mm00443013_m1), Myog (Mm00446194_m1), Myl1
(Mm00659043_m1) and Myh3(Mm01332463_m1).
Zebrafish maintenance, embryo collection and morpholino injections:
Zebrafish (AB strain) were raised and maintained under standard conditions, with
embryos collected and staged as previously described (49). All animal research was

approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine.
For zebrafish gene knockdown experiments, two splice blocking morpholinos
(MO) were designed at the intron 2-exon 3 junction of myog; MO1: 5’ATCTGAGAAAAGTAGACCACAATGT-3’ and MO2: 5’GACGACACCTGTCACACACACAC-3’ (Gene Tools, LLC), along with a standard
negative control morpholino (5’- CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA -3’) targeting a
human beta-globin intron mutation for beta-thalassemia. We also injected a p53
morpholino (5’- GCGCCATTGCTTTGCAAGAATTG- 3’) at 2ng concentration along with
our transcript-specific morpholinos because this morpholino has been reported to
suppress the apoptotic effects induced by some morpholinos (50). Injections were
performed on ~30 one- to two-cell zebrafish embryos independently on at least 3
different days (n=100). Different concentrations (from 1 to 6ng) of MO were injected to
determine the optimal concentration at which a phenotype could be consistently
detected. The data shown are for 4ng where there was a measurable phenotype for
enteric neurons at 4 dpf (days post-fertilization) without severe malformation or death of
embryos.
Immunostaining, visualization and cell counting:
Injected zebrafish embryos were fixed at 4 dpf with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
for 2 hours at room temperature. A monoclonal anti-HuC antibody (Invitrogen #A21271), followed by Alexa Fluor 568 F (ab’)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody (Invitrogen #A11019), was used for fluorescent labeling of enteric
neurons as previously described (40, 51), with mild modifications. The embryos were
bleached after fixing in 4% PFA by incubating them in 3% H2O2/0.5% KOH medium until
there was complete loss of epidermal pigmentation (~20 min), followed by a 5 min wash
with PBS to stop the bleaching reaction. 50 stained embryos (for both wildtype and
morphants) were visualized using a Zeiss AxioZoomV16 fluorescent microscope using a
DS red filter to assess the colonization of enteric neurons in the gut of each embryo.
Stained neurons were counted using the Image-based Tool for Counting Nuclei (ITCN)
plugin in ImageJ (41), with the following parameters: width 9 pixels, minimum distance

4.5 pixels, threshold of 1 and using a selected Region of Interest (ROI). Since enteric
neurons in Hirschsprung disease models in zebrafish are mostly lost caudally in the gut,
we chose our ROI as 8 somites starting at the caudal end of the gut and moving
rostrally. At least 20 embryos were used for cell counting for each concentration of
morpholino used. P values were calculated from a pairwise 2-tailed t-test.

Figure 1: Gene expression in the embryonic mouse gut.
Comparisons of FPKM from RNA-seq and threshold cycle (Ct) values after 40 cycles of
qPCR of wildtype embryonic male mouse gut cDNA isolated at the developmental
stages of E10.5, E12.5 and E14.5. We set FPKM = 5 as the value considered for a gene
to be expressed; error bars are the standard errors of the mean for 3 biological
replicates each.
Figure 2: Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA).
A correlation matrix using bi-weight mid-correlation in Weighted Gene Co-Expression
Network Analysis (WGCNA) between 18 modules constructed from all expressed genes
from 36 different conditions (3 time points, 2 sexes, 2 genotypes, 3 replicates). At a
Bonferroni correction threshold adjusting for 18 modules (p<0.00277), the lightcyan
module was found to be associated with sex (p=0.001), and, the tan (p= 0.0015), cyan
(p= 0.0007), yellow (p=0.0026) and pink (p=0.0027) modules were found to be
associated with genotype. The tan (p=6.18x10-5), black (p=9.7x10-5) and brown
(p=0.0002) modules were associated with gene expression at E10.5 as compared to
other time points. At E14.5, turquoise (p=5.2x10-16), brown (p=4.6x10-15), red (p=8.8x108
), black (p=1.4x10-5) and blue (p=2.7 x10-4) modules were associated in comparison to
other time points; salmon (p=0.0022, 62 genes) was associated with E12.5 only. All the
associated module for each condition has been highlighted.
Figure 3: Biological processes affected by genes changing over developmental time.
Various modules are associated with different developmental time points and shows a
continuity of biological processes over time. The brown module is associated with E10.5
(early gut expressed genes) and the GO biological processes these genes are involved
in include mostly transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. The Salmon module
associated with E12.5 contain genes involved in protein folding and transport which are
also seen in the Black and Turquoise modules, which are associated with E14.5. The
Red and Blue module associated with E14.5 contain genes involved in the cell cycle,
cell division, DNA repair and are weakly expressed at this stage when compared to
early developmental stages. The corresponding heatmaps for all modules are also
shown.
Figure 4: Biological processes affected by genes changing due to genotype and sex.
(A) Heat map of GO biological processes for the two modules associated with genotype
shows genes involved in neural crest migration and neuron division (Cyan), while (B)
transcription and chromatin modifiers (yellow) are affected with loss of Ret transcription.
(C) The lightcyan module consist of 43 genes for peptidase activity and cholesterol
transport and is associated with sex.

transcriptome shows that transcription factors are highly expressed at E10.5, while
genes controlling more specialized structures (e.g., vasculature) or processes (e.g., cell
adhesion and cell signaling) are prominent at E14.5. Genes marked in red have
statistically significant (q-value <0.01) expression differences between the two states
indicated.
Figure 6: Ret-dependent gene expression in the developing gut.
Scatter plots of log2 FPKM values between wildtype and Ret homozygous null
embryonic gut at (A) E10.5, (D) E12.5 and (G) E14.5. Genes marked in red in the
scatter plots have statistically significant (q-value <0.01) expression differences
between the indicated states. Genes activated by Ret at E10.5 (B) includes neuronal
genes and genes involved in transcriptional control, while those suppressed by Ret at
E10.5 (C) include genes involved in extra cellular matrix formation and in hormonal
response. Similar annotation analyses at E12.5 shows that along with neuronal genes,
Ret also activates genes expressed in the musculature (E) and suppresses genes
involved in epithelial development (F). At E14.5, Ret activates muscle-specific and
vasculature development genes (H) while suppressing genes involved in epithelial
morphogenesis (I).
Figure 7: Crosstalk between enteric neurons and its supporting mesenchymal cells.
(A) Gene expression qPCR of specific muscle markers were performed using FACSsorted Mhy11-positive cells from Myh11-EGFP transgenic mouse guts at E10.5. Low
level expression of Myog, Myl1 and Myh3 is observed in the gut smooth muscle cells at
this stage of development. (B) Morpholino knockdown of myog in zebrafish leads to a
skeletal muscle phenotype (significant body curvature along the anterior-posterior axis).
Morpholino knockdown of myog in zebrafish leads to the skeletal muscle phenotype of
significant body curvature along the anterior-posterior axis along with significant loss of
enteric neuron precursors at 4 days post fertilization (dpf). The neuronal numbers,
counted in a region of interest starting at the 8th somite and measuring till the end of the
gut tube (yellow box), upon sampling 50 embryos each from wildtype and morphant
embryos are significantly different (**P<0.001).
