Abstract

RNA modifications affect the stability and function of RNA species, regulating important
downstream processes. Modification levels are often dynamic, varying between tissues
and individuals, although it is not always clear what modulates this variation or what
impact it has on biological systems. Here, we quantify variation in RNA modification
levels at functionally important positions in the mitochondrial genome across 11,552
samples from 39 tissue/cell types and find evidence that modification levels impact
mitochondrial transcript processing. We identify novel links between mitochondrial
RNA modification levels in whole blood and genetic variants in the nuclear genome,
including missense mutations in LONP1 and PNPT1, as well as missense mutations in
MRPP3, SLC25A26 and MTPAP that associate with RNA modification levels across
multiple tissue types. Genetic variants linked to modification levels are associated with
multiple disease phenotypes, including blood pressure, breast cancer and Moyamoya
disease, suggesting a role for these processes in complex disease.

Introduction

RNA modifications are post-transcriptional changes to the chemical composition of nucleic
acids and represent a means by which RNA function can be fine-tuned (Li and Mason 2014).
Sites of RNA modification are often highly evolutionarily conserved and are crucial for
processes such as development, cell signalling and maintenance of the circadian rhythm,
pointing to a major role for RNA modification in fundamental cellular processes (Li and
Mason 2014). To date, over 160 different types of RNA modification have been identified
(Boccaletto et al. 2018), occurring on several types of RNA molecule, though they are found
most abundantly on ribosomal and transfer RNAs (Machnicka et al. 2013). The exact role of an
RNA modification depends on the type, location and target of the modification. Within tRNAs
for example, modifications in the anticodon region can increase a tRNAs decoding capacity,
and improve translational fidelity (Yarian et al. 2002), whereas modifications to the core of a
tRNA molecule can promote correct folding and structural stability (Helm 2006).
Modifications to rRNA molecules are largely involved in the stabilisation of the ribosome
structure, but can also facilitate protein synthesis (Sloan et al. 2017), and modifications to
mRNA molecules can affect the maturation, translation and degradation of an mRNA molecule
by either recruiting additional proteins or by altering the secondary structure of the mRNA
(Zhao et al. 2017). Importantly, not all modifications are fixed; instead, some display a
dynamic range of modification (Hauenschild et al. 2015), which may in turn reflect a dynamic
mode of RNA regulation.

Interest in RNA modifications has recently been renewed, due to the development of highthroughput technologies that can detect modifications on a transcriptome-wide scale.
However, these studies are often small in scale and limited to specific cell lines, and frequently
focus on the detection of novel modification sites rather than attempt to survey the dynamic

range of modification level across a large number of sites and samples (Clark et al. 2016;
Dominissini et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017; Safra et al. 2017). Here, we utilise computational
methods (Sanchez et al. 2011; Hodgkinson et al. 2014; Hauenschild et al. 2015; Idaghdour and
Hodgkinson 2017) to quantify RNA modification levels across a total of 11,552 human RNA
sequencing (RNAseq) libraries in 39 tissue/cell types. Within this, we focus on data from
mitochondrial-encoded RNA, where due to its abundance across all tissues, we can detect
RNA modifications at multiple functionally important positions along the mitochondrial
transcriptome.

Mitochondria have essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including energy production,
signalling, ion metabolism and apoptosis. The mitochondrial genome encodes 2 rRNA genes,
22 tRNA genes, and 13 mRNA genes (Anderson et al. 1981), and is transcribed polycistronically, after which it is processed according to the ‘tRNA punctuation model’ to release
individual RNA components (Ojala et al. 1981), whereby tRNAs interspersed between rRNA
and mRNA genes are cleaved by nuclear-encoded proteins (Holzmann et al. 2008; Brzezniak
et al. 2011; Sanchez et al. 2011; Powell et al. 2015). Intermediate and mature RNA transcripts
harbour extensive RNA modifications, which impact features such as transcript structure and
stability that can be important for both processing and function (Rorbach and Minczuk 2012).
Interestingly, steady state levels of mature mitochondrial transcripts vary substantially from
the 1:1 ratio that might be expected from polycistronic transcription (Mercer et al. 2011),
indicating the importance of post-transcriptional processes in the maintenance of
mitochondrial homeostasis.

In illustration of this, knock-down of nuclear encoded mitochondrial RNA processing enzymes
in mice leads to the accumulation of unprocessed mitochondrial encoded transcripts,
decreased levels of protein synthesis and altered mitochondrial respiration rates (Sanchez et

al. 2011; Sen et al. 2016). Likewise, altered modification of mitochondrial-encoded RNA can
have similar consequences; 1) methylation of bases on the ninth position of certain
mitochondrial tRNAs is understood to have an impact on tRNA structure and stability (Helm
et al. 1999; Helm 2006) which in turn may influence post-transcriptional tRNA recognition
and cleavage dynamics and therefore downstream protein translation; 2) methylation of mtRNR2 transcripts at mtDNA position 2617 is believed to provide stabilising interactions to
mature mitoribosomes, and lack of methylation at this position has been linked to impaired
mitochondrial protein synthesis (Bar-Yaacov et al. 2016); 3) methylation of mt-ND5
transcripts at mtDNA position 13710 varies according to tissue type (Safra et al. 2017), and
interferes with translation through mitoribosome stalling and leads to decreased protein
levels (Li et al. 2017). In this study, we focus on quantifying variation in mitochondrial
encoded RNA modification levels at these three classes of site on a population level across
multiple tissue types. We perform quantitative trait mapping using mitochondrial-encoded
RNA modification rates in order to identify nuclear genetic variants and genes that are
involved in the regulation of these processes across tissues, and to unravel their downstream
functional consequences.

Results

Overview

In order to study variation in modification levels of mitochondrial-encoded RNA across
multiple tissue types, we mapped and filtered 13,857 RNAseq samples from 39 tissue/cell
types, across 5 independent datasets (see Methods and Materials, Supplementary Table 1), to
the human reference genome using a stringent pipeline optimised for the analysis of

mitochondrial data. Previous work has demonstrated that the levels of a particular form of
mitochondrial RNA modification (RNA methylation) can be inferred at particular nucleotides
using the proportion of mismatching bases in RNAseq data (Mercer et al. 2011; Sanchez et al.
2011; Hauenschild et al. 2015) (see Methods and Materials for details). As such, we use this
proportion to quantify the level of RNA methylation at three categories of modified site where
RNA methylation is known to be functionally important; 1a) methylation at position 9
(henceforth referred to as P9 sites) of 13 different mt-tRNAs along the mitochondrial genome,
1b) an averaged estimate of methylation level across 11 different mt-tRNA P9 sites that
consistently show variation in whole blood (Hodgkinson et al. 2014), 2) methylation at mtDNA positon 2617 within mt-RNR2 and 3) methylation at mt-DNA position 13170 within mtND5.

RNA Methylation Patterns Across Tissues

Across the 39 different tissue/cell types examined, blood, brain, muscle and nerve tissues
show the highest levels of RNA methylation across all tRNA P9 sites combined, with average
levels of 11-25%, 7-12%, 11%, and 10% respectively (ranges shown where multiple datasettissue type pairs are available). In contrast, the lowest levels of tRNA methylation are
observed in cell lines, with average levels across P9 sites ranging between 0.3-0.5% in LCLs
and at 0.7% in transformed fibroblasts (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1). RNA methylation
levels also vary between individual tRNA P9 positions along the mitochondrial genome. For
example, across all datasets methylation levels at tRNA position 3238 have an average value
of 0.9%, whereas the average methylation levels at position 8303 is 12%. To test whether mttRNA P9 methylation levels are similar between different P9 sites along the mitochondrial
transcriptome within an individual, we measured correlations between methylation levels at
each pair of mt-tRNA P9 sites within each dataset-tissue type pair. Across all individuals and

dataset-tissue types, all correlation coefficients were significant after correction for multiple
testing, and centred around 0.75, ranging between 0.18-0.95 (Fig. 1b), suggesting that
methylation levels at different P9 sites are broadly consistent along the mitochondrial
transcriptome within each individual.

Outside of tRNAs, the average methylation level at mt-rRNR2 (position 2617) and mt-ND5
(position 13710) transcripts are generally high across all tissues examined (Fig. 1a), with
sample wide average values of 55% and 10% respectively. Considering mt-RNR2 transcript
methylation levels across tissues, average levels range between 38% in GTEx Testis and 67%
in GTEx Heart (Atrial Appendage). Across tissues, average levels of transcript methylation at
mt-ND5, a protein coding gene, show more variation, ranging between 1% in TwinsUK
subcutaneous adipose and 23% in NIMH whole blood. Within dataset-tissue pairs, we
additionally see considerable variation in transcript methylation levels across individuals
(Supplementary Fig. 2). For example, at position 2617 in the CARTaGENE whole blood
dataset, methylation levels vary between 0.48-0.72, and between 0.11-0.76 in the Geuvadis
lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) data.

To test if mitochondrial RNA methylation levels (at tRNA P9 sites, within the mt-rRNR2 site
and within the mt-ND5 site) are correlated across tissue types within an individual, we
selected individuals from the GTEx dataset, where RNAseq data from the largest number of
alternative tissue types were available, and measured pairwise correlations. For tRNA P9
sites, 11% of pairwise comparisons were significant after correction for multiple testing
(median r=0.42, range 0.28-0.7, Fig. 1c). At the mt-RNR2 (position 2617) and mt-ND5
(position 13710) sites, 76% (median r=0.49, range 0.24-0.81) and 95% (median r=0.59, range
0.3-0.88) of correlation coefficients are significant after correction for multiple testing
respectively (Fig. 1c). Collectively, these results demonstrate detectable variation in

as consistency in the levels observed along the mitochondrial transcriptome and across

Nuclear Genetic Associations

To identify nuclear genetic variation associated with mitochondrial-encoded RNA methylation
levels, we obtained genome-wide genotyping data for the same samples that we had RNA data
for, and carried out association analyses within each of the 39 tissue/cell types for the level of
methylation at functionally important positions within the mitochondrial genome. This
included methylation levels at: 1a) 13 different tRNA P9 sites along the mitochondrial
genome, 1b) a combined measure across multiple tRNA P9 sites (see methods), 2) position
2617 within mt-rRNR2 and 3) at position 13710 within mt-ND5. For tissues where we had
multiple independent datasets, which includes whole blood, adipose, skin (non-sun exposed)
and LCLs, we then carried out meta-analyses. Across all association studies, we corrected for
multiple testing by accounting for genome-wide testing, the number of methylation sites
examined and the number of tissues included in the analysis, resulting in a significance
threshold of P < 6.79 x 10-11.

Across all tissue types and mitochondrial RNA positions where we quantify methylation
levels, we find a total of 47 significant associations (peak nuclear genetic variant and
mitochondria encoded RNA methylation level pairs). Most associations occur in tissues for
which we have multiple independent datasets, and thus larger sample sizes (Table 1, Figure 2
for associations observed in whole blood); 25 nuclear genetic loci are significantly associated
with mitochondrial-encoded RNA methylation levels in whole blood, 4 are detected in
subcutaneous adipose, 2 in non-sun exposed skin and 1 in LCLs. In single dataset tissues, we
identify 15 significantly associated loci across four different tissue types: artery (aorta), nerve
(tibial), oesophagus (muscularis and gastroesophageal junction) and heart (left ventricle)
(Supplementary Table 2). Across all associated loci, many regions are overlapping in different

with methylation level at both tRNA P9 sites and the mt-RNR2 site and 1 region associated
with mt-ND5. Within this, 5 loci represent novel associations detected in this study, and 4
represent replication of previously identified associations in whole blood (Hodgkinson et al.
2014) that we now identify in multiple tissue types across the body.

Figure 2. Relationship between genotype and methylation level at multiple positions on the
nuclear genome and mitochondrial transcriptome respectively. Methyl groups are
represented by red circles along the mitochondrial transcriptome, and methylation levels are
shown at three categories of methylated site: at tRNA P9 sites (blue), at position 2617 within
mt-RNR2 transcripts (red) and at position 13170 within mt-ND5 transcripts (green). Averaged
levels of methylation across 11 mt-tRNA P9 sites are additionally shown in the grey shaded
box (bottom left). Beta estimates and P-values displayed are from meta-analysis of four
independent whole blood datasets, and methylation levels and genotypes displayed in
boxplots originate from the CARTaGENE dataset.

Functional Characterisation

In order to identify the potential genes and mechanisms through which nuclear genetic
variants are associated with mitochondrial encoded RNA methylation levels, we prioritised
significantly associated variants as potentially causal by annotating them as; 1) resulting in a
missense mutation in a protein, 2) affecting expression of a nearby gene and additionally
showing evidence of having a mediating effect on mitochondrial RNA methylation level (see
Methods), or 3) having the lowest P-value within each associated region.

Applying this approach, we identify a number of novel candidate causal nuclear genetic
variants and genes associated with mitochondrial tRNA methylation levels. First, we find a
missense mutation (rs11085147) in LONP1 that is associated with methylation levels at mttRNA-G (position 9999) and mt-tRNA-H (position 12146). LONP1 a mitochondrial matrix
protein and is involved in degradation of damaged or unfolded polypeptides, in addition to
the maturation of certain mitochondrial proteins(Zurita Rendón and Shoubridge 2018).
Second, an intronic SNP (rs3820190) in PLOD1 shows evidence of association with
mitochondrial RNA methylation levels at mt-tRNA-R (position 10413) through altered
expression of the gene (Table 1). PLOD1 is not currently thought to be involved in
mitochondrial function, however MFN2 (a gene involved in mitochondrial fusion) was also
identified as an eQTL gene for rs3820190. Athough it was not significant in mediation
analysis, it remains a viable candidate for the causal gene in this case due to its involvement in
mitochondrial processes. Third, within heart tissue (left ventricle), we additionally identify an
association between rs10513664, an intronic SNP in the MECOM gene, (which has not
previously been linked to mitochondria) and methylation level at mt-tRNA-G (position 9999,
Supplementary Table 2). MECOM is a transcription factor involved in the proliferation and

maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells, and its dysregulated expression has been linked to
worsened prognoses in patients with haematological cancers (Shimabe et al. 2009).

Aside from these novel associations, we also replicate previously identified links between
missense mutations rs13874 and rs11156878 (within SLC25A26 and MRPP3 respectively)
and mitochondrial-encoded tRNA methylation levels in whole blood (Hodgkinson et al. 2014).
However, we additionally find significant associations between these variants and tRNA P9
methylation levels in adipose, skin, LCLs, artery, oesophagus and nerve tissues (Table 1),
showing that these links may be important across the body. SLC25A26 is a mitochondrial
carrier protein, involved in transporting S-adenosylmethionine (a substrate involved with
RNA methylation) into mitochondria, and MRPP3 is part of a complex responsible for 5’ mttRNA processing, and thus are directly involved in processes that may impact RNA
methylation.

Outside of mitochondrial tRNAs, we identify a novel association between a missense mutation
(rs782572) in PNPT1, and methylation level at position 2617 within mt-RNR2, in addition to
an intronic variant (rs11684695) that is significantly associated with transcript methylation
levels in whole blood, and mediates mitochondrial RNA methylation levels through the
expression of genes including TRMT61B, a mitochondrial methyltransferase. At position
13710 within mt-ND5, we replicate the association with rs1047991 that was identified in a
previous study (Hodgkinson et al. 2014), which is a missense mutation in MTPAP, a
mitochondrial poly-A polymerase. The latter two associations did not replicate in previous
work (Hodgkinson et al. 2014), however do replicate across multiple tissue types in this study
(Table 1, Supplementary Table 3), and therefore suggest that these genes may play a global
role in the regulation of RNA modification.

Cross-Tissue Analysis

As whole blood made up our largest dataset (2,424 RNAseq libraries across four datasets), we
tested whether nuclear genetic variants associated with mitochondrial RNA methylation
levels in whole blood operate in a tissue specific or tissue-wide manner. For each of the 25
significant mitochondrial methylation site-variant pairs in whole blood, we tested for
evidence of replication, with the same direction of effect, at matched methylation site and
variant pairs in all other tissues. We correct for the number of methylation site-variant pairs
we test, and in total 12/25 position-SNP pair associations replicate in at least one other tissue
type (Supplementary Table 3). rs11156878, which is associated with the average level of RNA
methylation at tRNA P9 sites, replicates in 22 additional tissues. rs11684695, associated with
RNA methylation level of position 2617, showed replication in 25 other tissues, and
rs1047991, associated with RNA methylation at position 13170, is replicated in 15 additional
tissues (Supplementary Table 3). This suggests that certain genetic loci associated with
mitochondrial RNA methylation levels in whole blood are active in multiple other tissues, and
potentially in a system-wide manner. Other variants however, such as rs13874, which
associated with methylation level at multiple individual mt-tRNA P9 sites in whole blood,
does not show evidence of association in other tissues, suggesting that it may be tissue
specific.

Consequences of Variation in Mitochondrial RNA Methylation

Methylation modifications at mt-tRNA P9 sites are thought to stabilise the secondary
structure of the corresponding mt-tRNA sequences within the mitochondrial transcriptome
(Helm et al. 1999), and as tRNA structure may be important for post-transcriptional substrate
recognition and cleavage, we tested if methylation levels at tRNA P9 sites were related to mt14

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/666339; this version posted June 11, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

mRNA expression. Since RNA methylation levels at P9 sites are strongly associated with a
missense mutation in MRPP3, which is part of an enzyme (RNase P) that cleaves the 5’ end of
mitochondrial tRNAs, we specifically considered the 9 occurrences where an mRNA or rRNA
gene is found immediately upstream of a tRNA. Using data from the CARTaGENE project,
which is our largest, long-read, paired end dataset, we find that tRNA methylation levels are
significantly associated with the expression levels of genes immediately upstream in 6 out of
9 cases at P<0.05 (5 of which show positive correlations) and 3/6 remain significant after
correcting for the number of pairs tested (Table 2). This suggests that increased methylation
levels at these tRNA P9 sites are associated with increased expression of its nearest upstream
gene. To test for replication, we used the GTEx dataset, which is our second largest, long-read,
paired end dataset of unrelated samples. We find that 2/6 nominally significant correlations
show evidence of replication, with the same direction of effect. These include the positive
association between methylation level at mt-tRNA-L1 and expression of mt-RNR2, and the
negative relationship between methylation level at mt-tRNA-G and expression of mt-CO3
(Table 2).

Overlap with Disease Associated Loci

Finally, to identify potential links between genetic variants associated with mitochondrial
RNA methylation levels and complex-traits and phenotypes, we looked for overlaps between
peak associated variants (and SNPs in strong LD, r2 ≥ 0.8), and genome-wide significant
disease associated variants in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog (MacArthur et al. 2017). We find
overlaps with diastolic (Ehret et al. 2016) and systolic blood pressure (Kristiansson et al.
2012; Ehret et al. 2016), Moyamoya disease (Duan et al. 2018), estrogen-receptor negative
breast cancer (Couch et al. 2016; Milne et al. 2017) and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (Liu et
al. 2018) (Supplementary Table 4).

First, the peak genetic variant (rs3820190) associated with methylation at mt-tRNA-R
(position 10413) through the expression of PLOD1, is in high LD with a genetic variant
(rs2273291) linked to Moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disease that is characterised
by progressive narrowing of the lower brain vasculature that can lead to transient ischemic
attacks and stroke (Duan et al. 2018). Duan et al (2018) also report that a subset of
individuals with Moyamoya disease (that also carry the risk allele at rs2273291) have slightly
elevated levels of serum homocysteine, which itself is associated with an increased risk of
stroke (Wald et al. 2002). Interestingly, S-adenosylmethionine is an intermediary substrate in
the homocysteine biosynthesis pathway (Hankey et al. 2004), possibly explaining the link
observed in the present study, as an increased level of homocysteine could mean that there is
less S-adenosylmethionine available for RNA methylation.

Second, the missense mutation in PNPT1 (rs782572) that is associated with methylation level
of mt-RNR2 (position 2617), is in high LD with rs197548, which is associated with systolic

and diastolic blood pressure (Ehret et al. 2016). Mitochondria have previously been linked to
increased blood pressure, predominantly through mechanisms involving mitochondrial
oxidative stress, however the exact mechanisms by which this is the case remain unclear
(Dikalov and Dikalova 2016). We have previously observed associations between nuclear
genetic variants influencing the expression of certain mitochondrial genes, mediated through
the expression of PNPT1 (Ali et al. 2019), and the identification of the overlap here suggests
that RNA methylation level may also be playing a contributory role in the process. A SNP
within an intron of the MECOM gene (rs6779380) has previously been associated with
changes in blood pressure (Ehret et al. 2016), however this variant it is not in LD with the
variant that we identify in heart (left ventricle, rs10513664), despite the latter also being
located within an intron of MECOM.

Finally, rs11684695, which is associated with methylation level at mt-RNR2 (position 2617),
through the expression of TRMT61B, is in high LD with rs4577244 and rs67073037, both of
which have been linked to breast cancer. The role of mitochondria in cancer has been debated
since the discovery of the Warburg effect (WARBURG 1956), and subsequent research has
linked many additional pathways/features of the mitochondria to tumorigenesis, including
through alterations in its roles in cell death, metabolism, and oxidative stress (Vyas et al.
2016). In previous work, we observed an increase in the level of tRNA P9 methylation levels
in cancer tumours vs matched normal tissues (Idaghdour and Hodgkinson 2017); our
observation of an overlap here suggests that methylation level at mt-RNR2 may also be
involved. Additionally, rs11684695 is also in high LD with rs6737027, which has been
associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (Liu et al. 2018), and an increased incidence of
scoliosis in patients with mitochondrial myopathies has also been reported (Li et al. 2015).

Discussion

RNA modifications represent an additional layer of control in the regulation of gene
expression. They are found extensively throughout both the nuclear and mitochondrial
transcriptome, where they play important roles in structural stability and translation
efficiency. Using mitochondria as a model system, we characterise RNA methylation levels at
multiple functionally important sites on the mitochondrial transcriptome, across a total of 39
tissues/cell types. We find that RNA methylation levels are correlated along the
transcriptome, but vary between tissues, with blood and brain tissues showing the highest
levels of variation. As the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have co-evolved over
evolutionary time, we also link variation in mitochondrial RNA methylation levels to genetic
variation in the nuclear genome.

In total, we associate 8 nuclear genes to fundamental biological processes taking place in
human mitochondria. Within this, we identify novel associations between mitochondrial RNA
methylation levels and missense mutations in LONP1 and PNPT1, eQTLs regulating the
expression of PLOD1 and TRMT61B and an intronic variant within MECOM. Furthermore, we
find that previously identified associations (Hodgkinson et al. 2014), which have been linked
to MRPP3, TRMT61B and MTPAP (rs11156878, rs11684695 and rs1047991 respectively),
occur in multiple tissue types, which may have important implications for disease.

MRPP3 is the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial RNase P, a complex responsible for the 5'
cleavage of mt-tRNAs (Holzmann et al. 2008), and is active only in the presence of its other
subunits (Reinhard et al. 2015), MRPP1 and MRPP2. The MRPP1 and MRPP2 sub-complex
however, is able to carry out its methyltransferase activity independently of MRPP3 (Vilardo
et al. 2012), so the association between rs11156878 within MRPP3 with methylation of mt18

tRNAs is likely detected due to its effect on cleavage capacity. TRMT61B is a methyltransferase that is responsible for the methylation of position 58 on certain mitochondrial
tRNAs, in addition to position 2617 in mt-RNR2 (Bar-Yaacov et al. 2016). In the present study,
an intronic SNP (rs11684695) is associated with increased levels of methylation at mt-RNR2,
as well as increased expression of TRMT61B, likely explaining the relationship detected here.
MTPAP is responsible for the polyadenylation of the 3’ end of mitochondrial mRNAs, and this
polyadenylation is important for the stability of the transcripts (Nagaike et al. 2005), which
potentially influences the methylation levels of mt-ND5 transcripts. Of genes newly implicated
with mitochondrial RNA methylation levels through missense mutations, LONP1 has been
shown to degrade MRPP3 as part of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (Münch and
Harper 2016), possibly explaining its association with methylation level. Finally, PNPT1 is
involved in multiple metabolic RNA processes in mitochondria, and reduction of PNPT1 levels
results in impaired mitochondrial processing and accumulation of large polycistronic
transcripts, possibly due to its connection to the import of RNase P RNA into the mitochondria
(Wang et al. 2010a; von Ameln et al. 2012), again likely explaining why it is associated with
methylation level in this study.

Interestingly, rs13874, a missense mutation in SLC25A26, tends to only be associated with
tRNAs towards the beginning of the mitochondrial transcript in whole blood, and does not
show evidence of replicating across tissues. SLC25A26 is a mitochondrial carrier protein that
is responsible for transporting S-adenosylmethionine into the mitochondria, which is a
methyl group donor in methylation reactions. The absence of rs13874 replication across
tissues may be related to the fact that the highest levels of methylation are seen in whole
blood, in combination with SLC25A26 concurrently having the lowest levels of expression in
whole blood (https://gtexportal.org/home/gene/SLC25A26). Therefore, the effect of a
possible transportation deficiency may only be observed in tissues where the requirement for

methylation is high. As blood is the tissue in which we detect the highest levels of methylation,
but also the lowest levels of SLC25A26 expression, this mutation may have particularly
important implications for blood-based processes and diseases.

The downstream functional consequences of altered mitochondrial RNA processing are well
documented in human cell lines and model organisms (Sanchez et al. 2011; Perks et al. 2017),
but here using in vivo data we show that natural variation of mitochondrial RNA methylation
levels in ‘healthy’ individuals may influence mitochondrial processes (namely changes in
mitochondrial gene expression). Disruption or perturbation of the function of nuclear genes
that we have implicated in mitochondrial RNA methylation can have serious phenotypic
consequences. In humans for example, a mutation in PNPT1 has also been linked with
impaired import of RNA into the mitochondria, and leads to Combined Oxidative
Phosphorylation Deficiency (Vedrenne et al. 2012) and also Autosomal Recessive Deafness
(von Ameln et al. 2012); missense mutations in LONP1 have also been implicated with CODAS
syndrome, which is a developmental disorder affecting multiple systems (cerebral, ocular,
dental, auricular and skeletal) (Strauss et al. 2015); mutations in SLC25A26 have been linked
to Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency (Kishita et al. 2015) and mutations in
MTPAP have been linked to spastic ataxia (Crosby et al. 2010). Similarly, TRMT61B has been
identified as a differentially expressed gene in a small cohort of Alzheimer’s disease cases,
when compared to matched controls (Perks et al. 2017), and knockdown of the drosophila
homolog of MRPP3 leads to the loss of locomotive function in Drosophila, similarly to what is
seen in Parkinson’s disease (Sen et al. 2016).

These examples are phenotypically varied and are the result of extreme alterations in the
function of the corresponding gene. The genetic variation associated with RNA methylation
levels in this study have less extreme effects, however, they are linked with changes in post20

transcriptional processing and downstream expression of mitochondrial genes. While this
variation might be tolerated under normal physiological situations, the introduction of
stressful situations, for example during increased mitochondrial damage through ageing, may
be enough to push a tissue that is heavily reliant on appropriate mitochondrial function into
dysfunction. Conversely, altered mitochondrial expression over a long duration may be
enough to lead to negative later life consequences. Impaired mitochondrial gene expression
due to the heterozygous knockout of PTCD1, a mitochondrial RNA processing enzyme for
example, has been linked to later-life obesity in mice (Perks et al. 2017). In this study, we find
overlaps between genetic variants associated with mitochondrial RNA methylation levels and
variants linked to blood pressure, breast cancer and Moyamoya disease, suggesting that
altered mitochondrial RNA modification may play a role in more complex diseases. Overall, as
the expression of mtDNA is regulated primarily at the post-transcriptional level, it is
important to understand how variation in nuclear encoded genes affects mitochondrial RNA
methylation and gene expression, as changes in this can lead to changes in mitochondrial
metabolism that impact mitochondrial function.

Methods

Data Description

RNA sequence and genotype data were obtained from five independent, publically available
projects, including:

CARTaGENE (Awadalla et al. 2013): A population-based cohort comprised of people aged
between 40-69, from Quebec, Canada. Whole blood samples were taken for RNA sequencing

and genotyping, producing 100bp paired-end RNAseq reads and genotypes from the Illumina
Omni2.5M genotyping array. Samples with RNAseq data from multiple sequencing runs, that
passed quality control, were merged before the alignment stage. Data were obtained through
application to the data access committee (instructions are available at www.cartagene.qc.ca).

NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) Genomics Resource (Battle et al. 2014): Whole
blood samples were collected for RNA sequencing and genotyping from the Depression Genes
and Networks study. Individuals were aged 21-60, and are a case/control cohort. 50bp singleend RNAseq reads were produced, along with genotypes from the Illumina HumanOmni1Quad BeadChip. Mapped RNAseq reads for duplicate samples that passed quality control were
merged for further analysis, and samples failing QC were discarded. Data were obtained after
application to the data access committee (through www.nimhgenetics.org)

Geuvdais Project (Lappalainen et al. 2013): LCL samples from the 1000 Genomes cohort were
RNA sequenced to produce 75bp paired-end RNAseq reads and were obtained from the
European Nucleotide Archive under submission number ERA169774. Mapped DNA sequence
data from phase 1 of the project were downloaded from the 1000 Genomes FTP site
(v5a.20130502).

TwinsUK Project (Grundberg et al. 2012): Female monozygotic twin pairs, dizygotic twin
pairs and singletons, aged between 38-85 were recruited for RNA sequencing and genotyping.
Biopsies from subcutaneous adipose tissue and skin were collected, as well as peripheral
blood samples for additional generation of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). 50bp paired-end
RNAseq data were produced from these tissues as well as genotypes from Illumina
HumanHap300 and Illumina HumanHap610Q genotyping arrays. Data were obtained through

application to the TwinsUK data access committee and then downloaded from the European
Genome-Phenome archive (https://ega-archive.org) through study ID EGAS00001000805.

GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) Project (Consortium 2013): Multiple tissue samples were
collected from deceased individuals for RNA sequence analysis and dense genotyping, with
sample age range varying between 20-71. We use a combination of data from the pilot and
midpoint phases of the GTEx project, where samples were genotyped in the Illumina Omni5M
and Illumina Omni2.5M genotyping arrays respectively. RNAseq read lengths produced by the
project varied, and we analyse samples with 75bp long reads only. Data were obtained by
application to dbGaP through accession number phs000424.v6.p1.

Full data accession information, sample sizes and tissue types are described further in
Supplementary Table 1.

RNAseq Mapping

FastQC [v0.11.3] (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) was run on
raw RNAseq data, and samples with drops in base quality below phred 20 or uncalled bases in
the middle of reads were discarded. RNAseq reads were then pre-processed to remove
adaptor sequences and low quality trailing bases (Phred < 20) using TrimGalore [v0.4.0]
(https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/). Poly-A/T sequences
greater than 4bp were also removed from read termini using PRINSEQ-lite

[v 0.20.4]

(Schmieder and Edwards 2011). Remaining reads with >20 nucleotides were then mapped to
the human reference sequence (1000G GRCh37 reference, which contains the mitochondrial
rCRS NC_012920.1) using STAR [2.5.2a_modified] 2-Pass mapping, allowing approximately 1
mismatch per 18 bases per read, rounded down to the nearest integer. STAR soft-clipping was

also allowed. After mapping, FastQC [v0.11.3] was rerun on data, and samples with median
sequence quality scores falling below Phred 20 were removed from further analysis. SAMtools
[v1.4.1] (Li et al. 2009) was then used to retain only properly paired and uniquely mapped
reads. This stringent step was applied to ensure that analysed reads originated from the
mitochondria, rather than nuclear encoded fragments of mitochondrial DNA (NUMTs).
Transcript abundances were calculated using the ‘intersection non-empty model’ within
HTseq [v0.6.0] (Anders et al. 2015), and gene expression counts were then quantified
according to transcripts per million (TPM). Genes expressed in all samples with an average
TPM value > 2 were used to calculate principal components (PCs) in R and outliers identified
from visualisation of PC1, PC2 and PC3 were excluded. Samples were further excluded for
having: fewer than 5,000,000 remaining reads, fewer than 10,000 mitochondrial reads, rRNA
content greater than 30%, RNAseq mismatch percentage greater than 1%, or intergenic read
percentage greater than 30%.

Quality Control, Phasing and Imputation of Genotype Data

QTLtools [v1.0] (https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools/) was used to ensure sample labelling was
consistent between genotype and RNAseq data. Quality control (QC) of genotype data was
carried out using PLINK [v1.90b3.44] (Chang et al. 2015). Duplicate samples, genetic PC
outliers, samples with unexpected relatedness and samples with outlying heterozygosity rates
were removed, in addition to samples with discrepant reported and genotypic sex
information, or ambiguous X chromosome homozygosity estimates. Samples with > 5%
missing genotype data were also excluded. SNPs were removed for violating Hardy-Weinberg

Quantification of Mismatch Rate at Modified Sites

Previous studies have shown that the proportion of mismatching bases at certain sites on the
mitochondrial transcriptome can be used to represent the level of post-transcriptional
methylation at these sites. During library preparation for RNA sequencing, methylation
modifications on transcripts can interfere with the reverse transcription process by causing
the reverse transcriptase to randomly incorporate nucleotide bases at the methylated
position (Hauenschild et al. 2015). Though not a direct reflection of methylation level
(Hauenschild et al. 2015), this mismatch signature can be used to estimate the level of
methylation present on transcripts by measuring the proportion of non-reference alleles at
modified sites (Mercer et al. 2011; Sanchez et al. 2011; Hodgkinson et al. 2014; Idaghdour and
Hodgkinson 2017). Previous work has demonstrated that methylation levels estimated this
way are repeatable across experiments (Hodgkinson et al. 2014), and comparison of samples
treated with demethylation enzymes to untreated controls confirms the presence of
methylation at the ninth position of 19/22 mt-tRNA positions, at similar levels to when
measured by primer extension (Clark et al. 2016). Here, we consistently detect modification

levels at levels ≥ 1% at 13/19 of these mt-tRNA sites, which correspond to the following
mitochondrial genomic coordinates: 585, 1610, 3238, 4271, 5520, 7526, 8303, 9999, 10413,
12146, 12274, 14734 and 15896. We also calculate methylation level at mtDNA positions
2617 and 13710, which correspond to locations within mt-RNR2 and mt-ND5 respectively;
methylation levels at these sites can also be determined using RNAseq (Hauenschild et al.
2015; Li et al. 2017).

Positional read coverage at mitochondrial sites were summarised using SAMtools mpileup
and mismatch rate was calculated from sites with a nucleotide quality score ≥ Phred 13 and
coverage ≥ 20x. A site was then considered to show evidence of being methylated if the
average proportion of mismatches within a dataset was greater than 1%, as below this level,
mismatched due to the presence of methylation is indistinguishable from mismatches due to
sequencing error. A combined measure of methylation level was also calculated by averaging
across 11 mt-tRNA p9 sites: 585, 1610, 4271, 5520, 7526, 8303, 9999, 10413, 12146, 12274
and 14734 (where values are present), in order to gain an idea of processes influencing posttranscriptional methylation overall. These sites consistently show variation in whole blood
data and have previously been used as an estimate of combined methylation (Hodgkinson et
al. 2014; Idaghdour and Hodgkinson 2017). Methylation values 3 standard deviations from
the mean were masked to avoid association results being driven by extreme values.

Pearson’s correlation coefficients between methylation levels at different tRNA P9 sites
(including averaged levels across P9 sites) were calculated within individuals, across all
datasets and tissue types available. A total of 91 comparisons that were carried out. Pearson’s
correlation coefficients between methylation level at the same position, across multiple
tissues, were carried out using measurements from the GTEx dataset. For a position to be
compared between tissues, we required that both tissues have an average methylation level of

1% and at least 100 pairs of data points to compare. For tRNA P9 sites, there are 1657
comparisons, for positions 2617 and 13710 there are 219 comparisons.

Association Analyses and Meta-Analysis

Association analyses studies were carried out for modification positions with an average
methylation level ≥ 1% variation per dataset. Association analyses were carried out
separately for each position and tissue, using linear models in PLINK [v1.9] (Chang et al.
2015). For the TwinsUK tissues, GEMMA [v0.96] (Zhou and Stephens 2012) was used to
calculate a relatedness matrices and association tests were carried out using univariate linear
mixed models. Covariates used in the association model included 5 study specific genetic PCs
and 10 PEER factors calculated from RNAseq data using PEER [v1.0] (Stegle et al. 2012) for
tissues with ≥100 samples or 5 genetic PCs and 5 PEER factors for tissues with <100 samples.
Additional covariates included in the association model were sex, genotyping array and RNAsequencing batch information, where available and where relevant. Tissues with multiple
datasets were meta-analysed using PLINK [v1.9], under a fixed effects model.

Cis-eQTL Identification and Mediation Analysis

To identify genes through which nuclear genetic variants associated with mitochondrial posttranscriptional methylation levels were acting, we carried out a cis-eQTL analysis, followed by
mediation analysis. Cis-eQTLs and eGenes were identified by selecting protein coding genes
within a 1Mb interval of peak SNPs and testing for association between the genotype at the
peak SNP and cis-gene expression level in the corresponding tissue type, using quantile
normalised RNAseq data. For tissues with multiple datasets, cis-eQTLs were identified in the
dataset with the largest sample size. For blood, this corresponded to the CARTaGENE dataset,

for adipose and skin tissues, this corresponded to unrelated samples in the TwinsUK dataset,
and for LCLs, this corresponded to the Geuvadis dataset. eGENEs are reported if significant in
any corresponding tissue type and tests were corrected for the number of cis-genes tested for
association, per peak SNP. To identify causal relationships between genotype, gene expression
levels and methylation levels, we tested for significant mediation effects using 1000
bootstrapping simulations with the ‘Mediation’ package in R. Mediation analyses were carried
out using quantile normalised gene expression values, in the same datasets that eQTLs and
gene pairs were identified in. Each mediation test was corrected for the number of significant
cis-genes tested for evidence of a mediation effect with a SNP.

Candidate Causal Variant Selection

Significant SNPs were defined as SNPs passing genome-wide significance after correction for
the number of methylation positions analysed, and the number of unique dataset-tissue type
pairs they were analysed in, resulting in a threshold of (6.79 x 10-11). SNPs passing corrected
genome-wide significance were annotated using the ‘geneanno’ option in ANNOVAR [v201707-17] (Wang et al. 2010b). Candidate causal SNPs were further shortlisted as corrected
genome-wide significant SNPs that resulted in a missense mutation, or showed evidence for
mediating methylation levels as a cis-eQTL, or for having the lowest P-value.

Cross Tissue Replication Analysis

Peak methylation site-variant pairs from the whole blood meta-analysis were tested for
nominal evidence of significance in matched methylation site-variant pairs in other tissue
types (excluding the tissues that were meta-analysed). Nominal significance is defined as

P<0.05, corrected for the number of tissues the SNP-trait pair is tested in, and the number of
SNP-trait pairs tested.

Consequences of Variation in Mitochondrial RNA Methylation Levels

To test if methylation level at mitochondrial tRNA P9 sites have an impact on expression
levels of immediately upstream mitochondrial genes, we regressed the expression levels of
the upstream gene on the level of methylation at the relevant tRNA P9 site, including batch,
gPC 1-5 and PEER factors 1-10 as covariates in the model. This analysis was carried out in the
CARTaGENE whole blood dataset, which is our largest, paired-end, long read dataset, and
replicated in the GTEx whole blood dataset. We tested 9 regions of the mitochondrial genome,
where there is an rRNA or mRNA gene immediately upstream of a tRNA gene and identified
significant relationships at P<0.05, corrected for by the number of positions tested.

Overlap with Disease

We additionally tested for overlap between genetic variants identified in our association
studies, and SNPs in strong LD (r2 ≥ 0.8) within a 500kb interval, with genome-wide
significant SNPs associated with disease phenotypes reported in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS
Catalog (MacArthur et al. 2017). Variants in strong LD with peak SNPs were identified from
the NIMH, CARTaGENE, TwinsUK (unrelated samples only), GTEx and Geuvadis datasets using
PLINK, and were overlapped with data present in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog in March
2019.
