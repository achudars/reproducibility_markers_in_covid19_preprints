Abstract

22

23

The brain is possibly the most complex system known to mankind, and its complexity has

24

been called upon to explain the emergence of consciousness. However, complexity can take

25

many forms: here, we investigate measures of algorithmic and process complexity in both the

26

temporal and topological dimension, testing them on functional MRI data obtained from indi-

27

viduals undergoing various levels of sedation with the anaesthetic agent propofol, in two separate

28

datasets. We demonstrate that the various measures are differently able to discriminate between

29

levels of sedation, with temporal measures showing higher sensitivity. Further, we show that

30

all measures are strongly related to a single underlying construct explaining most of the vari-

31

ance, as assessed by Principal Component Analysis, which we interpret as a measure of overall

32

complexity of our data. This overall complexity was also able to discriminate between levels of

33

sedation, supporting the hypothesis that consciousness is related to complexity - independent

34

of how the latter is measured.

Introduction

36

The science of complex systems has gained increasing prominence in the 21st century. It combines

37

the reductionist ideal of science, with the notion of emergence, whereby high-level phenomena can

38

result from the interactions of simple constituent parts, confirming Aristotle’s saying that the whole

39

is more than the sum of its parts [1]. However, complexity science is also a discipline still in its

40

infancy. In particular, due to its appealing and apparently intuitive nature, the notion of complex-

41

ity has remained relatively ill-defined. The interdisciplinary nature of this science has resulted in

42

different fields applying the term complexity to multiple quantities, variously measured. Complex-

43

ity is perhaps best understood as the negation of simplicity. A system exhibits complex behaviour

44

when it is not uniform, stereotyped, or predictable. However, there is a key assumption that this

45

is not sufficient: complexity must emerge from the underlying orderly interactions of a system’s

46

components, about which its behaviour must provide information in other words, its unpredictabil-

47

ity must be more than mere randomness, but rather the result of interesting behaviours emerging.

48

Thus, a complex system lies between complete order such as the perfectly predictable regularity of

49

a crystal and complete disorder, as exhibited for instance by the random motion of molecules of

50

a gas. Complexity can be identified in more than one dimension of the same system, too. It may

51

be due to the structure of the interactions between components, such as the connections in a social

52

or biological network. Or it may only become apparent over time, as when it is applied to signals

53

and temporal patterns. Furthermore, there are different ways in which something can be said to be

54

complex, reflected in the different ways that have been developed to estimate complexity. On the

55

one hand, methods from algorithmic information theory such as Shannon entropy and Lempel-Ziv

56

compressibility [2, 3] emphasise unpredictability as the key property for complexity. One downside of

57

such approach, however, is that they would treat a purely random sequence as maximally complex.

58

Alternatively, methods from the physics of dynamical systems focus on the aspect of interactions

59

in the process whether between the system’s elements (e.g. synchronisability; [4]), between its

60

present and past states (e.g. Hurst exponent; [5]), or between different scales [6]. In this work,

61

we aim to explore the relation between algorithmic and process measures of complexity, in both

62

the topological and temporal dimensions. We choose to test these measures on a paradigmatically

63

complex system: the human brain. Not only is the brain the source of humans’ widely diverse

64

range of behaviours and accomplishments, which is itself suggestive of a highly complex underlying

65

organisation; its structure is also that of a complex network of subnetworks, in turn made of multiple

66

kinds of neurons obeying nontrivial plasticity rules for their interactions. For these reasons, it has

67

been proposed that the brain’s complexity may explain another unique property it possesses: con-

68

sciousness. Recent scientific theories of consciousness have emphasised, in one way or another, the

69

brain’s complexity as a crucial requirement for consciousness [7, 8, 9, 10]. Anaesthetic drugs such as

70

the GABA-ergic agonist propofol provide a way to controllably and reversibly modulate the brain’s

71

state of consciousness. Its complexity, in various aspects, may then be assessed based on signals

72

from noninvasive neuroimaging techniques. In particular, functional MRI (fMRI) has the advantage

73

of providing high spatial resolution, thus allowing for estimation of the brain’s network properties in

74

greater detail than afforded by other methods such as EEG. Here, we chose to evaluate measures of

75

algorithmic and process complexity applied to the temporal and topological (network) dimensions,

76

derived from fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals of volunteers undergoing sedation

77

with propofol, in order to investigate the relationship between the different measures of complexity,

78

as well as determining whether they can be related to different levels of consciousness. We also

84

Twenty-five healthy volunteer subjects were recruited for scanning. The acquisition procedures are

85

described in detail by Stamatakis et al, [11]: MRI data were acquired on a Siemens Trio 3T scanner

86

(WBIC, Cambridge). Each functional BOLD volume consisted of 32 interleaved, descending, oblique

87

axial slices, 3 mm thick with interslice gap of 0.75 mm and in-plane resolution of 3 mm, field of view

88

= 1926192 mm, repetition time = 2 s, acquisition time = 2 s, time echo = 30 ms, and flip angle 78.

89

We also acquired T1-weighted structural images at 1 mm isotropic resolution in the sagittal plane,

90

using an MPRAGE sequence with TR = 2250 ms, TI = 900 ms, TE = 2.99 ms and flip angle =

91

9u, for localization purposes. Of the 25 healthy subjects, 14 were ultimately retained: the rest were

92

excluded, either because of missing scans (n=2), or due of excessive motion in the scanner (n=9,

93

5mm maximum motion threshold).

Propofol Sedation

96

Propofol was administered intravenously as a target controlled infusion (plasma concentration mode),

97

using an Alaris PK infusion pump (Carefusion, Basingstoke, UK). Three target plasma levels were

98

used - no drug (baseline), 0.6 mg/ml (mild sedation) and 1.2 mg/ml (moderate sedation). A period

99

of 10 min was allowed for equilibration of plasma and effect-site propofol concentrations. Blood sam-

100

ples were drawn towards the end of each titration period and before the plasma target was altered,

101

to assess plasma propofol levels. In total, 6 blood samples were drawn during the study. The mean

102

(SD) measured plasma propofol concentration was 304.8 (141.1) ng/ml during light sedation, 723.3

103

(320.5) ng/ml during moderate sedation and 275.8 (75.42) ng/ml during recovery. Mean (SD) total

104

mass of propofol administered was 210.15 (33.17) mg, equivalent to 3.0 (0.47) mg/kg. The level of

sedation was assessed verbally immediately before and after each of the scanning runs. The three

conditions from this dataset are referred to as Awake, Mild and Moderate sedation respectively.

108

These data were generously provided by the Brain and Mind Institute, Department of Psychology,

109

The University of Western Ontario. Sixteen healthy volunteer subjects were recruited for scanning.

110

Scanning was performed using a 3 Tesla Siemens Tim Trio system with a 32-channel head coil, at

111

the Robarts Research Institute in London, Ontario, Canada. Participants lay supine in the scanner.

112

Function echo-planar images (EPI) were acquired (33 slices, voxel size: 3 x 3 x 3mm; inter-slice gap

113

of 25%, TR=2000ms, TE=30ms, matrix size=64x64, FA=75 degrees). An anatomical volume was

114

obtained using a T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE sequence (32 channel coil, voxel size: 1x 1 x 1mm, TA=

115

5 min, TE=4.25ms, matrix size=240x256, FA=9 degrees).

Propofol Sedation

118

Intravenous propofol was administered with a Baxter AS 50 (Singapore). The infusion pump was

119

manually adjusted using step-wise increases to achieve desired levels of sedation of propofol (Ram-

120

say level 5). Concentrations of intra-venous propofol were estimated using the TIVA Trainer (the

121

European Society for Intravenous Aneaesthesia, eurosiva.eu) pharmacokinetic simulation program.

122

If Ramsay level was lower than 5, the concentration was slowly increased by increments of 0.3 µg/ml

123

with repeated assessments of responsiveness between increments to obtain a Ramsay score of 5.

124

Ramsay level 5 was determined as being unresponsive to verbal commands and rousable only by

125

physical stimulus. In contrast to Propofol Dataset A, the two conditions from this dataset are re-

126

ferred to by Awake and Deep sedation respectively, reflecting the substantial increase in sedation

depth present in this dataset.

Temporal preprocessing included nuisance regression using anatomical CompCor to remove noise

136

attributable to white matter and CSF components from the BOLD signal, as well as subject-specific

137

realignment parameters (three rotations and three translations) and their first-order temporal deriva-

tives [13]. Linear detrending was also applied, as well as band-pass filtering in the default range of

139

[0.008, 0.09] Hz [14]. For a more detailed discussion of the details of the CONN default preprocessing

140

pipeline, see Whitefield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012.

141

2.2

142

To explore the space of different formalizations of complexity, we used algorithms from algorithmic

143

information theory (Lempel-Ziv compressibility, sample entropy, and principal component analysis),

144

as well as from dynamical systems physics (Higuchi fractal dimension, Hurst exponent). Before

145

analysis, the BOLD time-series were transformed by applying the Hilbert transform. The absolute

146

value of the transformed signal was then taken, to remove negative frequencies and ensure that all

147

series were positive. The Hilbert transform was also used to maintain consistency with earlier studies

148

exploring the complexity of brain activity as it relates to consciousness [15, 16].

149

2.2.1

150

The Lempel-Ziv algorithm is a computationally tractable method for quantifying the complexity of

151

a data-series by calculating the number of distinct patterns present in the data. For sufficiently large

152

datasets, it is a useful approximation of Kolmogorov complexity, which is famously uncomputable

153

for most strings [2]. The method used here is described in Shartner et al., (2015). Briefly: for every

154

ROI in our parcellated brain, a time-series F (t) is binarized according to the following procedure:

Complexity of BOLD Signals

155

The resulting time-series are stacked into a binary matrix M (X, T ), where every row corresponds

156

to the time-series FB (t) for every ROI x ∈ X and every column is a time-point t ∈ T . The matrix is

157

then flattened orthogonally to T , resulting in a vector V of length X × T , on which the Lempel-Ziv

158

analysis was performed.

159

The Lempel-Ziv algorithm creates a dictionary D, which is the set of binary patterns that make

160

up V and returns a value LZC ∝ |D|. For every time-series FB (t) ∈ X, a random time-series was

161

created, by shuffling all the entries in F (t). These were stacked into a binary matrix Mrand , with the

162

same dimensions as M , however containing only noise. This random matrix was flattened and its

163

LZC value calculated. As the randomness of a string increases, LZC → 1, so this value was used to

164

normalize the ”true” value of LCC , which was divided by LZCRand to ensure all values were within

165

a range (0, 1).

166

2.2.2

167

Sample Entropy (SampEn) quantifies how unpredictable a signal is [3] by estimating the probability

168

that similar sequences of observations in a timeseries will remain similar over time. To compute

169

SampEn, each time-series X(t) of length N is divided into subsections S of length m and the

170

Chebychev distance between two sections Si , Sj is calculated. Two sections are ”similar” if their

171

distance is less than some tolerance r. The procedure is repeated for sections of length m + 1. We

172

then calculate the probability that, if two data sequences of length m have distance less than r, then

173

the same two sequences of length m + 1 also have distance less than r.

Sample Entropy

SampEn = −log

A
B

174

Where A is the number of chunks of length m + 1 that are similar (have Chebyshev distance less

175

than r), and B is the number of chunks of length m that are similar. Low values of SampEn would

176

indicate that the signal is highly stereotyped - with a perfectly predictable series, such as [1,1,1, ...]

177

having a SampEn of zero, and SampEn increasing as the series becomes more disordered.

178

179

SampEn depends on the choice of parameters m and r. Here, we used m = 2 and r = 0.3 ×
σ(X(t)), where σ() is the standard deviation function.

180

SampEn has been used to test the level of sedation induced by propofol and remifentanil in

181

electrophysiological studies (Ferenets et al., 2007), and been shown to be associated with the degree

182

of sedation much like Lempel-Ziv complexity has.

183

2.2.3

184

The Hurst Exponent returns an estimate of how predictable a time-series is by quantifying its

185

’memory,’ or how dependent the value at time t is on the value at time t − 1 [5]. There are a number

186

of algorithms for estimating the Hurst Exponent; here we report results calculated using a rescaled

187

range approach. In it, a time-series X(t) of length N is segmented into non-overlapping sections of

188

length n, Xi (t). For each segment, the cumulative departure from the signal mean is calculated:

Hurst Exponent

Xi0 (t) =

n
X

xt − x̄

t=0
189

where x̄ is the mean of Xi (t). The rescaled range of deviations (R/S) is then defined as:
R
max(Xi0 (t)) − min(Xi0 (t))
=
S
σ(Xi (t))

190

where σ() is the standard deviation function. We then compute R/S for all Xi (t) and average

191

them, generating (R(n)/S(n)), which is the average scaled range for all the subsections of X(t) with

192

length n. We are left with a power relation, where:
R(n)
∝ n−H
S(n)

193

Where H is the Hurst exponent, and can be extracted by regression.

194

2.2.4

Higuchi Fractal Dimension

195

To calculate the temporal fractal dimension, we used the Higuchi method for calculating the self-

196

similarity of a one-dimensional time-series [6], an algorithm widely used in EEG and MEG analysis

197

[17]. From each time-series X(t), we create a new time-series X(t)m
k , defined as follows:

X(t)m
k = xm , xm+k , xm+2k , ..., xm+b N −m ck
k

198

where m = 1, 2, ..., k.

199

For each time-series X(t)m
k in k1 , k2 , ...kmax , the length of that series, Lm (k), is given by:

Lm (k) =
200

Pb N −m c
−1
( i=1k |xim+k − x(i−1)k |) b NN−m

k

We then define the average length of the series hL(k)i, on the interval [k, Lm (k)] as:

hL(k)i =

201

k
X
Li (k)
)
k
m=1

If our initial time-series X(t) has fractal character, then:

hL(k)i ∝ k −D
202

Where D is our desired fractal dimension. The Higuchi algorithm requires a pre-defined kmax

203

value as an input, along with the target time-series. This value is usually determined by sampling

204

the results returned by different values of kmax and selecting a value based on the range of kmax

205

where the fractal dimension is stable. For both datasets, we sampled over a range of powers of

206

two (2, ..., 128). Due to the comparably small size of BOLD time-series, the range of kmax values

207

that our algorithm could process without returning an error was limited. We ultimately decided on

208

kmax = 32 for Dataset A and kmax = 64 for the Dataset B.

209

2.2.5

210

Principal component analysis (PCA) is commonly used to compress data by finding the dimensions

211

that encode the maximal variance in a high-dimensional dataset. Here, we use PCA in a matter

212

similar to Lempel-Ziv complexity, to relate the complexity of sets of BOLD signals to their compress-

213

ibility. The more algorithmically random the dataset, the more orthogonal dimensions are required

214

to describe the dataset, which we took advantage of to attempt to quantify the complexity of our

215

BOLD time-series data. We constructed a large array of un-binarized BOLD signals, M (X, T ) to

216

which we applied a standard feature scaler from Scikit-Learn [18] to ensure all values had a mean

217

of zero and unit variance, and then a PCA function, recording recorded how many dimensions were

218

required to cumulatively describe 95% of the variance in the original dataset. We used this value as

219

our measure of data complexity.

220

2.3

221

Networks are a common example of complex system, and perhaps none more so than the human

222

brain, which can be considered as a network at multiple scales. A network, or graph, is represented

223

mathematically as an object comprised of nodes (in this case, cortical regions) and the connections

224

between them, or edges (in this case, functional connectivity given by statistical association of

225

the regions’ BOLD time-series). Investigating how the complexity of brain functional networks is

226

affected by the anaesthetic drug propofol is therefore a clear way of testing our hypothesis that loss

227

of consciousness should reduce the brain’s level of complexity.

228

2.3.1

229

To construct brain functional connectivity networks, the preprocessed BOLD time-series data were

230

extracted from each brain in CONN and the cerebral cortex was segmented into distinct ROIs,

231

using the 234-ROI parcellation of the Lausanne atlas [19]. Each time-series F (t) was transformed

232

by taking the norm of the Hilbert transform, to maintain consistency with the time-series analysis.

H(t) = |Hilbert(F (t))|
233

234

Every time-series H(t) was then correlated against every other time-series, using the Pearson
Correlation, forming a matrix M such that:

Mij = ρ(Hi (t), Hj (t))
235

236

The matrices were then filtered to remove self-loops, ensuring simple graphs, and all negative
correlations were removed:

The results could then be treated as adjacency matrices defining functional connectivity graphs,

where each row Mi and column Mj corresponds to an ROI in the initial cortical parcellation, and

240

their connection being represented by the corresponding cell in the matrix. For each graph theoretical

241

analysis, a range of percentage thresholds (k%) were tested to ensure that any observed effects were

242

not an artefact of one particular threshold, and are consistent over different graph topologies.

243

2.3.2

244

Algebraic connectivity (AC) is a measure of graph connectivity derived from spectral graph theory

245

[4], which gives an upper bound on the classical connectivity of a graph. As such, it is often used as a

246

measure of how well-integrated a graph is and how robust it is to damage, in the sense of the number

247

of connections that must be removed before it is rendered disconnected. Unlike classical connectivity,

248

which must be calculated by computationally intensive brute-force methods, AC is quite easy to

249

find for even quite large graphs. AC is also a measure of graph synchronizability and emerges

250

from analysis of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators [20]. For a simple example, imagine

251

placing identical metronomes at every vertex of a graph and allowing the vibrations to propagate

252

along the edges. The synchronizability describes the limit behaviour of how long it will take all the

possible temporal dynamics of the brain networks modelled by our functional connectivity graphs.

The AC of a graph G is formally defined as the first non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix

256

LG associated with G. LG is derived by subtracting the adjacency matrix AG from the degree matrix

DG :

LG = DG − AG
258

As every row and column of LG sum to zero, and it is symmetric about the diagonal, the

259

imaginary part of every eigenvalue in the spectrum of LG is zero, and if G is a fully-connected

260

graph, then:

0 = λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ λ3 ≤ ... ≤ λmax
261

To ensure that we were capturing the full topology of the graph, we calculated λ2 for each graph

263

at multiple thresholds [10, 20, 30, ... 90], creating a curve Λ = [λ210 , λ220 , λ230 ...λ290 ]. We then
R
integrated Λ using the trapezoid method to arrive at our final value AC = Λ dx.

264

2.3.3

265

In contrast to AC, which we use to explore the limit behaviour of possible brain temporal dynamics,

266

our measure of graph compressibility is purely algorithmic, and estimates the Kolmogorov complexity

267

of a graph: that is, the size of a computer program necessary to fully recreate a given graph G. To

268

do this, we re-employ the Lempel-Ziv algorithm originally used to calculate the LZC score of BOLD

269

signals. Here we use it to calculate a related measure, LZG , which is the length of a dictionary

270

required to describe the adjacency matrix AG of a given graph.

262

271

Graph Compressibility

To calculate LZG , we take a binary adjacency matrix and flatten it into a single vector V , and

273

then run the Lempel-Ziv algorithm on that vector. As a binary vector of length l can be used to
√
perfectly reconstruct an adjacency matrix defining a graph with l vertices (so long as l is a square

274

number, of course), we take V to be equivalent to a program defining G. As with AC, to ensure that

275

we were capturing the full topology of G, we calculated the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the binary AG

276

at the same nine thresholds [10...90], and then defined LZG as the integral of the resulting curve of

277

complexity values.

Higher-Order Measures

279

Once we had calculated individual measures of complexity, we tested how they related to each-other,

280

and (for Dataset A) serum concentrations of propofol. We correlated each one against all others to

281

construct a correlation matrix which describes, how different metrics cluster.

282

We also did a principal component analysis on the set of all results. We hypothesized that,

283

despite variability in the effectiveness of the individual measures, there should be a single, underlying

284

component reflecting a shared factor of ”complexity”. We further hypothesised that this underlying

285

factor should be predictive of both the level of consciousness, and (in Dataset A), of the individual

286

serum concentration of propofol.

287

2.5

288

All analysis was carried out using the Python 3.6 programming language in the Spyder IDE 2 , using

289

the packages provided by the Anaconda distribution 3 . All packages were in the most up-to-date

290

version. Packages used include SciKit-Learn [18], NumPy [21], SciPy [22], and NetworkX [23]. Unless

291

otherwise specified, all the significance tests are non-parametric: given the small sample sizes and

292

heterogeneous populations, normal distributions were not assumed. Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was

293

used to compare drug conditions against their respective control conditions.

and Moderate conditions (W(9), p=0.006), and Mild and Moderate conditions (W(4), p=0.002). In

303

Dataset B, the Wilcoxon test found significant difference between the Awake and Deep conditions

304

(H(19), p=0.011). In both datasets, the Awake condition had the highest complexity, and as the

305

depth of sedation increased, the associated LZC decreased. In Dataset A, the transition from Awake

306

to Moderate showed ∆ = −0.029 ± 0.027, and in Dataset B, the transition from Awake to Deep

307

showed ∆ =-0.029 ± 0.039. We note that these two results are remarkably similar, although this is

308

likely a coincidencee. For full results from Dataset A, see Table 1, and for Dataset B, Table 2. In

309

the propofol sedation conditions of Dataset A (Mild and Moderate), we found significant negative

310

correlations between LZC and serum concentrations of propofol (r=-0.55, p=0.002), see Figure 3A.

311

These results are consistent with previous findings that Lempel-Ziv compressibility of sponta-

312

neous brain activity is discriminative of level of consciousness in humans [15, 16] and animals [24].

313

Of all the time-series measures described, the LZC algorithm described here is distinct in that

314

it communicates information about the spatial complexity as well as the temporal complexity. This

315

is because, unlike other measures like Sample Entropy or Higuchi Fractal Dimension which are

316

calculated on 234 individual time-series and then averaged, LZC is calculated on an entire dataset,

317

which has been flattened column-wise, as was done in [15, 16, 25], by ”stacking” each column on top

318

of the next, resulting in a one-dimensional vector where the first 234 elements are the first column,

319

the second 234 elements are the second column, etc. This means that the vector V (see Methods

320

section) can be divided into 234 segments where every entry corresponds to the coarse activation of

321

a distinct brain region at the same time. The result is that each entry in the dictionary D created

322

by the Lempel-Ziv algorithm corresponds, not to a series of samples from a single ROI, but rather

323

a distribution of cortical regions that are ”on” or ”off.”

324

3.1.2

325

We found significant decreases in the Sample Entropy of BOLD signals under anaesthesia in both

326

Datasets A and B. In Dataset A, Kruskal-Wallis Analysis of Variance found a significant difference

327

between all three conditions (H(12.94), p=0.002) and post-hoc analysis with the Wilcoxon Signed-

328

Rank test found significant differences between the Awake and Moderate conditions (W(6), p=0.004),

329

and Mild versus Moderate conditions (W(8), p=0.005), but not the Awake versus Mild conditions.

330

In Dataset B there was a significant difference between the Awake and Deep conditions (W(21),

331

p=0.015). As with the LZC analysis, the Awake condition had the highest Sample Entropy in

332

both Datasets A and B, with the mean value decreasing with increasing sedation. In Dataset A,

333

we observed ∆ = 0.036 ± 0.035 from Awake to Moderate, and in Dataset B we observed ∆ =

334

−0.023 ± 0.031. In the Mild and Moderate conditions of Dataset A, we found a significant negative

335

correlation between serum concentration of propofol and Sample Entropy of BOLD signals (r=-0.53,

336

p=0.003).

337

These results are consistent with both the LZC results reported above and the findings of Ferentes

338

et al., (2007), who found that Sample Entropy decreased with increasing sedation in much the same

339

way that LZC does.

340

3.1.3

341

As with LZC, the PCA-based measure of BOLD signal complexity returns a measure of how com-

342

pressible the set of data are as a proxy for complexity, by identifying the number of components

343

required to explain a fixed proportion of the variance in the data. A larger number of components

344

to explain the same amount of variance would indicate less compressibility of the data. Thus, we

345

hypothesized that as level of sedation increased, so would the compressibility of BOLD signals,

346

as measured by the number of components required to explain 95% of the variance. In Dataset

347

A, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance found significant differences between all three conditions

348

(H(8.13), p=0.017), and post-hoc testing found significant differences between all three sets of con-

349

ditions: Awake vs. Mild (W(9), p=0.03), Awake vs. Moderate (W(6), p=0.016), and Mild vs.

350

Moderate (W(11), p=0.048). In Dataset B, we found a significant difference between Awake and

351

Deep (W(4), p=0.002). As before, there was a consistent pattern of increasing mean compressibility

352

(and a consequent decreasing number of required components) as sedation increased. In Dataset A,

353

∆ = −2.214 ± 2.73 from Awake to Moderate, and in Dataset B, ∆ = −5.188 ± 4.68. Here, the ∆ is

354

negative because the number of components decreased between the Awake and sedated conditions,

355

and is non-integer because it is the average over all subjects in the datasets. Of all the measures

356

of BOLD signal compressibility, this was the only measure that did not significantly correlate with

357

serum propofol concentration in the Mild and Moderate conditions in Dataset A.

358

As with LZC and the SampEn, these results indicate that as propofol-induced sedation increases,

359

the algorithmic complexity of BOLD signals decreases. All measures of complexity discussed so far

360

support each-other, despite being a variety of linear and non-linear algorithms.

361

3.2

362

3.2.1

363

The Hurst Exponent was the only measure that we hypothesized would increase as consciousness

364

was lost, rather than decrease, since as a signal becomes more predictable, its Hurst Exponent tends

365

towards unity [5]. In both Datasets A and B we found significant differences between conditions. In

366

Dataset A, Kruskal-Wallis Analysis of Variance found an omnibus difference (H(9.11), p=0.01), and

367

post-hoc testing found significant differences between Awake and Mild (W(16), p=0.022), Awake

368

and Moderate (W(8), p=0.005), and Mild and Moderate (W(17), p=0.026). In Dataset B, we found

369

significant differences between the Awake and Deep conditions (W(26), p=0.02). Unlike the previous

370

two metrics, and as we expected, we found a relative increase in the Hurst Exponent as sedation

371

increased: in Dataset A, we found ∆ = 0.014 ± 0.014 from Awake to Moderate sedation, and in

372

Dataset B we found ∆ = 0.01 ± 0.016 from Awake to Deep sedation. In Dataset A, we found a

373

significant correlation between serum concentration of propofol and Hurst Exponent in the Mild and

374

Moderate sedation conditions (r=0.393, p=0.039).

This is consistent with our initial hypothesis that as sedation increased and consciousness was lost,

376

the BOLD signals would become more predictable, as measured by an increasing Hurst Exponent.

The Higuchi Fractal Dimension was one of the least sensitive measures of BOLD signal complex-

between all three conditions (H(8.27), p=0.016), and post-hoc analysis found significant differences

between the Awake and Moderate conditions (W(15), p=0.019) and the Mild and Moderate condi-

382

tions (W(17), p=0.026), but not the Awake and Mild conditions. In Dataset B we found a significant

384

tropy, the Awake condition had the highest mean fractal dimension in both samples, which went

385

down as sedation increased: in Dataset A ∆ = −0.024 ± 0.032 from Awake to Moderate and in

386

Dataset B, ∆ = −0.018 ± 0.027 from Awake to Deep. Surprisingly, the Higuchi Fractal dimen-

387

sion showed a very strong negative correlation with serum propofol concentration in the Mild and

388

Moderate conditions of Dataset A (r=-0.614, p=0.0005).

389

The finding that Higuchi Fractal dimension was relatively less able to discriminate between level

390

of consciousness than LZC or Sample Entropy but more predictive of serum propofol concentration

391

is interesting. While it is hard to come up with a definitive interpretation, it may suggest that there

392

is some variable factor in individuals that makes their level of consciousness more or less resistant

393

to the changes in brain activity (as measured by Higuchi Fractal Dimension) induced by propofol,

394

or that the plasma concentration data offer more resolution, extending beyond the three artificially

395

imposed bins of Awake, Mild and Moderate sedation.

396

397

3.3.1

398

Our first of two measures of functional network complexity is algebraic connectivity, which returns

399

information about the robustness of the network to removal of elements [26]. In Dataset A, Kruskal-

400

Wallis analysis found a significant difference in algebraic connectivity between all three conditions

401

(H(9.654), p=0.008). Post-hoc analysis found significant differences between the Awake and Mod-

402

erate conditions (W(12), p=0.011) and the Mild and Moderate conditions (W(15), p=0.019), but

403

not the Awake versus Mild conditions. In Dataset B, we found a significant difference between the

404

Awake and Deep conditions (W(23), p=0.02). As before, in Datasets A and B the Awake condition

405

had the highest mean algebraic connectivity, with mean values dropping as sedation increased. In

406

Dataset A, ∆ = −107.67 ± 116.98 from Awake to Moderate, while in Dataset B, −906.09 ± 1235.07.

407

Despite the ability of algebraic connectivity to discriminate between conditions, there was no signif-

408

icant correlation with serum propofol concentration in the Mild and Moderate conditions of Dataset

409

A.

sciousness in propofol anaesthesia, algebraic connectivity in particular seems to lack the discrimi-

show that the topological complexity of functional brain networks can communicate information

417

The final metric we tested, and the second measure of topological complexity, was the compressibility

418

of functional connectivity adjacency matrices using the Lempel-Ziv algorithm. This was the weakest

419

of all the measures explored: the only significant difference was in Dataset A, between the Awake

420

and Moderate conditions (W(11), p=0.009), although in Dataset B there was a similar trend that

421

approached, but did not reach significance (W(32), 0.06). The general trend of Awake having the

422

highest value which decreased under increasing sedation was conserved (although note the large

423

standard deviations): in Dataset A ∆ = −2885.71 ± 4937.34 and in Dataset B ∆ = −4923.44 ±

424

8967.29. There was no significant correlation between graph compressibility and serum propofol

425

concentrations in Dataset A.

426

While this is clearly the weakest result, in the context of the others, we still find its success at

427

discriminating between the Awake and Moderate conditions of Dataset A intriguing, and suspect

428

that in a larger set of data it may have more discriminative power. The relationship between

429

consciousness and network compressibility may not be as direct as when performing analysis such

430

as LZC on BOLD signals, but these results suggest this is an area worth exploring.

437

quantify an underlying construct of overall complexity, then there should be a single component

438

that explains the majority of the variance of the results. In Dataset A, we found that the principal

439

component explained 67.07% of the variance in the set of results and in Dataset B the principal

440

component explained 71.05% of the variance of the results. In both datasets, this component corre-

441

lated extremely highly with each metric: in Dataset A it correlated most highly with LZC (r=-0.947,

442

p≤ 1 × 10−5 ), followed by Sample Entropy (r=-0.929, p≤ 1 × 10−5 ). In Dataset B, these two were

443

also the most highly correlated with the principal component, although the order was flipped, with

444

Sample Entropy having the highest correlation (r=-0.95, p≤ 1 × 10−5 ), followed by LZC (r=-0.932,

445

p≤ 1 × 10−5 ). When broken down by condition, in both Datasets, the principal component was

446

able to discriminate between states of consciousness: in Dataset A the Kruskal-Wallis test found a

447

significant difference between all three conditions (H(12.048, p=0.002), and post-hoc testing found

448

significant differences between the Awake and Moderate conditions (W(8), p=0.005), and the Mild

449

and Moderate conditions (W(3), p=0.001) but not the Awake and Mild conditions. In Dataset B

450

we found a significant difference between the Awake and Deep conditions (W(8), p=0.002). In the

451

Mild and Moderate conditions of Dataset A, the principal component significantly correlated with

452

serum concentrations of propofol (r=0.531, p=0.004). Thus, the principal component derived from

453

multiple specific measures of complexity can be related to states of consciousness in the human

454

brain, and may be identified with the overall complexity of the dataset.

456

In the present work, we have investigated measures of complexity from algorithmic information

457

theory and the physics of dynamical systems, as they apply to the temporal and topological (network)

458

dimensions of functional MRI brain data from individuals under different levels of propofol sedation.

459

Two main insights can be derived from our results. The first is that, at least in the context of

460

the human brain, different measures purporting to quantify complexity are indeed related to some

461

underlying common construct, regardless of the dimension along which they measure complexity,

462

or the aspect of complexity that they measure. This provides much-needed validation to the idea

463

that a dataset - and the system from which it derives - can be considered complex tout court,

464

rather than just being complex in a specific dimension, and according to a specific way of assessing

465

complexity. We term this the overall complexity of the system or dataset. In turn, this suggests

466

that it is appropriate to use the term complexity for the various specific measures, because there

467

does seem to exist a common underlying property of the data that they tap into. In particular, we

468

have demonstrated that the complexity of the human brain activity, as inferred from fMRI BOLD

469

signals, is modulated by one’s state of consciousness. This was observed both with the individual

470

measures - validating and extending previous results - and, most importantly, with the underlying

471

construct of overall complexity, which demonstrates its validity as a construct. The latter is also

472

reinforced by the fact that we were able to replicate this finding with a separate dataset.

473

Secondly, it is important to observe that different complexity measures, though correlated to each

474

other and related to the same underlying construct of overall complexity, are nevertheless sensitive

475

to different aspects of the data. In particular, measures operating along the temporal dimension

476

appeared especially sensitive at discriminating between levels of sedation; conversely, topological

477

measures failed to discriminate between Awake and Mild conditions in Dataset A, and also did

478

not correlate with propofol serum levels. This suggests that the temporal dimension of the human

479

brain’s complexity, as derived from BOLD signal timeseries (despite their limited temporal resolution

480

compared to EEG), may be especially vulnerable to loss of consciousness, at least as it is induced

481

by the GABA-ergic agent propofol. Further work may seek to identify whether this effect is uniform

482

across cortical regions, or whether specific areas’ timeseries are more largely affected by propofol

483

than others. This represents a novel insight regarding the ways in which anaesthetic drugs such as

484

propofol intervene on the brain to cause unconsciousness. Additionally, it would be worth exploring

485

whether this observation of different sensitivity of temporal and topological measures of complexity

486

is drug-specific, or if instead it is a generalisable feature of how the brain loses consciousness. Thus,

487

one future direction of research is to apply these same metrics to states of consciousness induced by

488

different anaesthetic agents, whose molecular mechanisms of action can vary widely. Disorders of

489

consciousness (DOC) due to severe brain injury may also represent a crucial future step for research:

490

unlike anaesthetics, DOC involve changes in the physical structure of the brain, which is bound to

491

impact the topology of brain networks. Investigating how this impacts the relation between different

492

measures and dimensions of complexity will provide further understanding into the relation between

493

complexity and consciousness in the brain. Additionally, as MRI is already a routine part of care for

494

DOC patients, algorithms such as those explored here might be helpful in determining the presence

495

or absence of consciousness in ambiguous states such as minimally conscious state.

496

Importantly, our results also show that, despite the relative temporal paucity of information in

497

BOLD signals, these signals carry sufficient information to discriminate between states of conscious-

498

ness. While preliminary, these findings suggest that the process complexity of individual BOLD

499

signals is at least partially re-encoded as topological complexity when forming functional connec-

500

tivity networks. One possible avenue of future work is to explore the parameters under which

501

this conservation of complexity is maximized (different similarity functions, different thresholding

502

procedures, etc), in order to increase the sensitivity of these measures. Crucially, even higher dis-

503

criminative power may be achieved by applying the same analyses to measures with higher temporal

504

information, such as EEG, which may then improve anaesthetists’ ability to detect unwanted resid-

505

ual consciousness in patients, thereby avoiding the rare but extremely distressing condition known

506

as intraoperative awareness [27].

507

Nevertheless, our work also presents a number of limitations, and these should be borne in

508

mind when evaluating the present results. Firstly, as already mentioned the temporal information

509

available in the BOLD signal is limited, and it is also not a direct measure of neural activity.

510

Additionally, our analysis pipeline involved removing the negative correlations between brain regions,

511

before the network analysis. While negative correlations are unclear in origin and interpretation, and

512

removing them is the most common approach, it is known that they are altered during anaesthesia

513

and other states of unconsciousness [28, 29, 30]; thus, ignoring them may have different effects

514

on conscious versus unconscious brain networks, which could explain the reduced sensitivity of

515

topological measures. Thirdly, in Dataset A the state of consciousness was determined based on the

516

estimated propofol concentration, rather than behaviour, so that different individuals’ susceptibility

517

to the drug may have led to different levels of sedation, despite the same level of propofol. However,

518

this concern is mitigated by the replication of our results in Dataset B, where sedation was deeper and

519

it was assessed behaviourally, so that all individuals met the same criteria. Finally, the measures

520

of complexity explored here are but a subset of those that have been proposed over the years in

521

the literature. Future research could benefit from expanding this repertoire, for instance including

525

We have investigated measures of algorithmic and process complexity of fMRI BOLD signal in both

526

the temporal and topological dimensions, at various levels of consciousness induced by propofol

527

sedation. Our results demonstrate that complexity measures are differently able to discriminate

528

between levels of sedation, with temporal measures showing higher sensitivity. Additionally, all

529

measures were strongly correlated, and most of the variance could be explained by a single underlying

530

construct, which may be interpreted as a more general quantification of complexity, and which

531

also proved capable of discriminating between levels of sedation, demonstrating a relation between

532

consciousness and complexity.

Figure 1: Here are the differences in the first principal component generated from all the measures
from Datasets A and B. Interestingly, in Dataset A, there was no significant difference between the
Awake and Mild condition, while there were differences between both of those states and the Moderate condition. While this may be a reflection of lack of sensitivity, it is worth noting that, between
the Awake and Mild conditions, consciousness was not actually lost: volunteers experienced conscious sedation, while the difference in level of consciousness between the Awake and and Moderate
conditions was much more dramatic. In Dataset B, where consciousness was fully lost in the Deep
condition, a significant difference appeared. Note that, despite the measures of complexity generally
dropping as consciousness was lost (with the notable exception of the Hurst exponent analysis),
the PCA analysis returned a Hurst-like pattern, with the values in the component increasing as
consciousness is lost. This does not indicate an increase in complexity in any sense, but rather, is an
artefact of how the dimensionality reduction transforms values. To ensure that this was not being
driven by the Hurst exponent in any way, we ran the analysis after multiplying each Hurst exponent
29
by -1 (so that the value decreased with loss of consciousness),
and found no difference in the result.

(LZ Graph and Algebraic Connectivity are both generally more highly correalted, as are LZC,

Hurst Exponent in Dataset A. The p-values ranged over many orders of magnitude from 10−2 to

Figure 3: There was a significant correlation between the first component and serum concentration
of propofol, with patients in the Mild condition (r = 0.53, p-value = 0.004) clustering together with
low concentrations, and increasing, with larger variances, as the propofol concentration climbs. As
with the plots shown above, the incongruous increase in the values of the component does not reflect
a relative increase in complexity in this case, but is an artefact of the PCA algorithm. No Awake
volunteers were included in this analysis, as all would have had a blood propofol concentration of
exactly zero.
