Abstract:
Searching for population genomic signals left behind by positive selection is a major
focus of evolutionary biology, particularly as sequencing technologies develop and costs
decline. The effect of the number of chromosome copies (i.e. ploidy) on the manifestation of
these signals remains an outstanding question, despite a wide appreciation of ploidy being a
fundamental parameter governing numerous biological processes. We clarify the principal
forces governing the differential manifestation and persistence of the signal of selection by
separating the effects of polyploidy on rates of fixation versus rates of diversity (i.e. mutation
and recombination) with a set of coalescent simulations. We explore what the major
consequences of polyploidy, such as a more localized signal, greater dependence on
dominance, and longer persistence of the signal following fixation, mean for within- and acrossploidy inference on the strength and prevalence of selective sweeps. As genomic advances
continue to open doors for interrogating natural systems, studies such as this aid our ability to
anticipate, interpret, and compare data across ploidy levels.
Intro:
Whole genome duplication (i.e. polyploidization) is common, particularly within the plant
kingdom (1). This macromutation can impact both macroevolutionary processes of colonization,
speciation, and extinction (2), and the microevolutionary processes of mutation, drift and natural
selection (3). Modern sequencing technologies provide insight into how selection shapes the
genomic landscape of divergence and could allow researchers to test hypotheses about how
polyploidy alters the tempo and mode of adaptation. However, before we can analyze sequence
data to test such hypotheses, we must understand how the same selective pressures alter our
ability to recognize a sweep in polyploids.
Numerous features of polyploids could impact the tempo and mode of adaptation. For
example, all else equal, an increase in chromosome number will increase the mutational target
size, and thus, the rate of adaptation in a mutation-limited world (4). The additional set of
chromosomes may also change dominance and epistatic relationships, potentially offering novel
routes to adaptation (5). Finally, the transition to polyploidy can shock the genomic system,
initiating manifold selective pressures (6). With the ongoing development of sequencing and
computational tools, researchers will surely turn to population genomic studies to better
understand the evolutionary consequences of polyploidy and to address hypotheses concerning
the nature of adaptation in polyploids.
However, most of our scans for selection have been developed with diploids in mind,
which hinders population genetic analysis of selection in natural polyploids. Thus, while we
would like to know if polyploidy fundamentally changes the action of selection, we first need to
know how two inherent features of polyploidy -- larger population mutation and recombination
rates, due to larger effective chromosome number, and slower responses to selection due to
lower variance in fitness -- change the neutral variation around adaptive substitutions, and
subsequently change our power to identify and localize sweeps. Importantly, the effect of ploidy
on each of these factors is to promote the retention of neutral diversity in polyploids, although
they likely differ in their qualitative and quantitative effects. In contrast to the more
straightforward, ‚Äòfactor-of-two‚Äô effects of polyploidy on mutation and recombination, the effect on
selection is more complicated due to the added potential for an allele to be masked or diluted in

heterozygous genotypes, effectively dampening the single-locus selection response across
much of the range of dominance conditions and allele frequency (9).
With appropriate consideration, coalescent simulations can generate haplotype data for
an arbitrary ploidy level (7), and thus guide interpretation of patterns of sequence variation. The
implicit assumption of free recombination among haplotypes, restricts our analysis to
autopolyploids (where chromosomal copies derive from a single ancestral species), which, by
some estimates are as or more frequent than allopolyploids (resulting from hybridization) (8).
We utilize these simulations to disentangle how the multifarious effects of chromosome number
impact the population genomic signals left behind by selection, again, focusing on the relative
impact on mutation and recombination versus the effects on selection and fixation times.
We show that the effects of selection on neutral diversity are both more striking and
more locally-restricted in polyploids as compared to diploids. Further analyses reveal that the
limited reach of selective sweeps in polyploids is primarily attributable to the extended fixation
time, rather than their increased population recombination rates. The differential effects of
ploidy on the selection signal are also highly dependent on the dominance of the mutation,
particularly for recessive cases. Lastly, we find that the signal of selection persists for more or
less time in higher ploidies, depending on the particular metric used. In sum, we highlight the
many ways that chromosome number fundamentally alters the selective process and the
consequences that this has for population genomic inference and comparison across ploidy
levels.
Methods:
Simulating polymorphism
We simulate selective sweeps with mssel (10), under the standard (ceteris paribus)
assumption that polyploidy simply increases the number of chromosome copies, cs (7). Thus,
the coalescent time unit equals cs * N, and the population mutation and recombination rates
equal Œ∏=2NcsŒºL and œÅ=2NcsrL, respectively, where L is the length of sequence to simulate (1
Mb for all simulations; see Table 1 for a list of parameter descriptions). By modelling ploidy with
the scalar, cs, we assume no preferential pairing between homologs and no ‚Äúdouble reduction.‚Äù
We further assume an equal number of individuals, n, sampled for all ploidies (we set n = 10 for
all analyses, thus the number of chromosomes sampled scales with ploidy).
We simulate a simple demographic scenario in which an ancestral population splits in
two at time g1, at which point a beneficial mutation arises in the middle of the chromosome (at
basepair 500,000) in one population and ultimately fixes. We sample n * cs haplotypes from
each population (Supp. Figure 1) g2 generations after a sweep is completed. We use the nonselected population as a neutral baseline and for the calculation of between-population
measures of selection (FST, XP-EHH, etc.).
Generating allele frequency trajectories
We developed a ploidy-general form of the allele frequency recursion equation as:

, where ct is ploidy number (diploids=2, tetraploids=4, etc.), i is the number of non-mutant
alleles, hi is the dominance coefficient for the genotype with i out of ct non-mutant alleles, p is
the allele frequency, and s is the selection coefficient. When ct = 2, we recover the familiar
formula for allele frequency change in diploids.
To compare across ploidies, we assume that the selection coefficient for a beneficial
mutation is the difference in relative fitness between alternative homozygotes, and that the
dominance coefficient for a heterozygous genotype is a simple function of the frequency of
beneficial alleles within the individual, and 3) this function is constant across ploidy levels. We
use a single value, which we call the dominance scalar (H), to control the form of the dominance
function (Figure 1C; similar to (4)). For a particular H (-0.5 < H < 0.5), a genotype‚Äôs dominance

129

coefficient is calculated as ‚Ñé = #% ' , where ùúè = *(10 ùêª) 123(4) *. With additivity (H = 0), the

relationship is linear, whereas a negative (recessive) value of H results in ùõï > 1, and thus a
convex function, and a positive (dominant) value results in a concave function (i.e. 0 < ùõï < 1).
We generated stochastic allele frequency trajectories as a series of sampling events
from the binomial distribution:

iterating until the beneficial was fixed or lost. Because we are only interested in successful
sweeps, we conditioned on fixation by only recording trajectories in which the beneficial allele
was fixed.

Analysis
The numerous metrics designed to detect selection vary widely in their assumptions and
robustness to various confounding forces, such as demography. To make valid comparisons
across ploidy, we are restricted to metrics which do not implicitly or explicitly assume diploidy.
We chose two common metrics based on nucleotide diversity (Tajima‚Äôs D and FST) and two
haplotype-based metrics (iHS and XPEHH). We calculated pairwise nucleotide diversity (ùúã), FST,
and Tajima‚Äôs D in overlapping windows (step size of ¬Ω full window size) using the R package
PopGenome (12). After experimenting, we found that 1 Mb / (N / 50) windows captured
meaningful variation in these summaries across all parameters that we investigated. We
calculated iHS (13) and XP-EHH (14) with the R package, rehh (15), using the parse_ms()
function from msr (https://github.com/vsbuffalo/msr) to file format conversion.
Results & Discussion:
Effect of ploidy on patterns of diversity following a selective sweep
The effect of selection on neutral diversity is stronger, but more locally restricted in
higher ploidies, whereas it is locally weaker, but more diffuse in diploids (Figure 2A). Assuming
that the rate of adaptation does not differ by ploidy, a greater proportion of the genome will be
affected by linked selection in lower ploidies. In higher ploidies, the greater magnitude of the
reduction in diversity was largely the result of the fact that higher ploidies have a higher baseline
level of diversity, a result that is made clear by the strong effect of cs on the magnitude of a
sweep (Figure 2B). The reduced breadth of the dips in higher ploidies was largely driven by the
elevated time to fixation, and less so due to the increased recombination rate, as can be seen

by the dominant effect of ct (‚Äútrajectory ploidy‚Äù) on sweep breadth (although recombination rate
also clearly has a marginal effect on breadth; Figure 2B). Together, this suggests that, with
whole genome sequencing, sweeps will be better localized with higher ploidies, but with
reduced representation sequencing, sweeps are more likely to be missed with higher ploides.
We also find that ploidy interacts with dominance to modulate the manifestation of
sweep signals. In contrast to an additive locus, where there is an approximate factor-of-two
effect of ploidy on fixation time, differences can be much greater for non-additive mutations,
particularly when the mutation is recessive (Figure 1A, C-D). For example, with strong
recessivity (H = -0.4) fixation time increases by ~10x whenever ploidy is doubled. This results in
a reduced signal of non-additive mutations in higher ploidies, whereas the effect of dominance
is minimal in diploids. In other words, recessive mutations are not only more likely to be lost in
higher ploidies, but they may also be more likely to go undetected when not lost (Figure 2C;
Supp. Figure 2).
This ploidy-dependent effect of dominance is partly mitigated in smaller populations. In
large populations, allele frequency change due to selection can be much slower at certain allele
frequencies in higher ploidies, as a consequence of the fact that genotypes with the greatest
differences in relative fitness are very rare (16) (Figure 1A, C-D). For recessive mutations, the
slowdown occurs initially because the mutant homozygote bearing the full manifestation of
selection is much rarer in higher ploidies (p2, p4, and p8 for dip-, tetra-, and octaploids,
respectively). Although greater stochasticity in allele frequency change in small populations will
result in more frequent loss of these alleles, for those that survive, it may push the frequency
above the critical threshold in which selection can gain traction (Figure 1C). Once past this
point, selection acts very quickly on recessive mutations, occasionally resulting in greater
effects on diversity than dominant or additive mutations, in contrast to what is observed in larger
populations (see ‚ÄúX‚Äù points on Figure 2C for median values when N = 1000). Dominant
mutations, on the other hand, stall at more intermediate frequencies, following sharp increases
in frequency early on. Here, drift can interfere with the weakened efficacy of selection and
ultimately produce a weaker signal in genomic data.
Measures of selection
Ploidy modestly amplified evidence for a sweep for most metrics of selection ,
particularly for the maximum observed values for the haplotype-based statistics (i.e. XPEHH
and iHS; Figure 2D, see ‚ÄòX‚Äô points for max values). The exception was for total peak area of
Tajima‚Äôs D, which showed a weaker signal with higher ploidy, and standardized Fst, which
showed no effect. The variance of these selection metrics also tends to decrease in higher
ploidies (Figure 2E), which is, again, particularly pronounced for the haplotype-based statistics.
The reduced variance is not simply a consequence of sampling a greater number of
chromosomes from the population (for a given number of individuals). Even when sampling an
equivalent number of alleles from each population, there is a notable reduction in variance in
higher ploidies (Figure 2E). Thus for equivalent sampling/sequencing effort, many metrics of
selection are more precisely estimated with higher plody.
We also find that with elevated ploidy, signals of selection persist for a longer time, as it
takes longer to reach mutation drift equilibrium with increasing coalescent times. This was the
case for the majority of the metrics that we investigated, with the exception of the iHS statistic.

The irregular iHS pattern in diploids results from a preponderance of undefined values when
taking ratios of haplotype scores in populations fixed for a single haplotype. Interestingly,
despite the increased effective recombination rate in polyploids, haplotype-based measures of
selection persist longer, again reflecting their slower return to equilibrium. Recent development
in phasing algorithms, necessary for calculating haplotype scores, will thus greatly advance our
ability to detect recent selection in autopolyploids (17).
Conclusion:
Polyploidy fundamentally changes microevolutionary processes. While the increased
mutational opportunity in polyploids may boost adaptation over evolutionary timescales (4), the
increased sojourn time of the beneficial allele has important consequences for shaping genomic
diversity, and thus evolutionary inference. Understanding these changes and their
consequences is important, as natural polyploids are increasingly being interrogated with
modern sequencing methods. In demonstrating the inherent effects of ploidy on particular
population genomic measures, our (and future) work will guide in the identification and
interpretation of signals of selection with higher ploidy.
