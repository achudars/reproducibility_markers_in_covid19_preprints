Abstract— From a large clinical blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we report
several interrelated findings involving transient supra-network brainwide states characterized by a saturation phenomenon we are referring
to as “polarization.” These are whole-brain states in which the voxelwise-normalized BOLD (vnBOLD) activation of a large proportion of
voxels is simultaneously either very high or very low. The presence of such states during a resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scan is significantly
anti-correlated with diagnosed schizophrenia, significantly anti-correlated with connectivity between subcortical networks and auditory,
visual and sensorimotor networks and also significantly anti-correlated with contemporaneous occupancy of transient functional network
connectivity states featuring broad disconnectivity or strong inhibitory connections between the default mode and other networks. Conversely,
the presence of highly polarized vn-BOLD states is significantly correlated with connectivity strength between auditory, visual and
sensorimotor networks and with contemporaneous occupancy of transient whole-brain patterns of strongly modularized network connectivity
and diffuse hyperconnectivity. Despite their consistency with well-documented effects of schizophrenia on static and time-varying functional
network connectivity, the observed relationships between polarization and network connectivity are with very few exceptions unmediated by
schizophrenia diagnosis. We also find that the spatial distribution of voxels most likely to contribute to the highly polarized states (polarity
participation maps (PPMs)) differs with a high degree of statistical significance between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Finally,
we report evidence suggesting the process by which the most polarized states are achieved, i.e. the ways that strongly polarized voxel regions
extend, merge and recede also differs significantly between patient and control populations. Many differences observed between patients and
controls are echoed within the patient population itself in the effect patterns of positive symptomology (e.g. hallucinations, delusions,
grandiosity and other positive symptoms of schizophrenia). Our findings highlight a particular whole-brain spatiotemporal BOLD activation
phenomenon that differs markedly between healthy subjects and schizophrenia patients, one that also strongly informs time-resolved network
connectivity patterns that are associated with this serious clinical disorder.

INTRODUCTION

While there is growing attention in human blood-oxygenation dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
studies focused on time-varying connectivity between functional networks [1-13] , much less attention is given to the global spatial
dynamics of activated brain space induced by and facilitating time-varying network relationships [14, 15]. These ambient whole-brain
spatiotemporal phenomena can exhibit strong relationships with disease [14] and provide a wider-angle lens through which to view the
results of network-level analyses. We present here one example of a dynamically varying spatial phenomenon that correlates very
strongly with schizophrenia diagnosis, exhibits structured and robust effects on observed functional network connectivity (FNC),
correlates significantly with occupancy of certain dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) state and also exposes very different
patterns of spatiotemporal dynamics and organization in schizophrenia patients (SZs) and healthy controls (HCs). The basis of this
analysis is an early-stage transformation of the pre-processed BOLD fMRI volume into voxelwise normalized form (vn-BOLD /vnfMRI). Although every voxel spends exactly a third of its time in the upper (resp. lower, resp. middle) third of its own intrinsic activation
profile, the proportion of gray-matter voxels simultaneously in the upper (resp. lower) third of their respective activation profiles during
given TRs is highly variable. In healthy subjects we find the brain coalesces regularly into states where a high proportion of voxels are
simultaneously in the highest (resp. lowest) third of their activation profiles, i.e. states in which the brain is highly polarized.

Figure 1 Key observation: healthy brains converge toward and achieve states of pervasive polarization. Both panels show mean normalized voxel
timeseries values along the z-dimension displayed on a medial slice advancing through time from left to right; (Left) a 42 yr old healthy male control
exhibits intervals in which apparently very large proportions of gray matter voxels are simultaneously toward the top or the bottom of their intrinsic
activation profiles (IAPs); (Right) a 40 yr. old male schizophrenia patient exhibits some weak progression toward accumulating large proportions of
similarly activated voxels, but the process never quite achieves the highly polarized states evident in the matched control displayed on the left.

These highly polarized brain states occur significantly more often in healthy controls than in schizophrenia patients (see Figure 1).
The more balanced state characterized by an approximately equal proportion of voxels in the highest, lowest and middle thirds of their
intrinsic activation profiles (IAPs) occurs much more frequently in schizophrenia patients. These polarized regimes are also very strongly
correlated with short-timescale whole-brain functional network connectivity states (some positive, some negative correlations in which
the effect direction differs between patients and controls for the highly modularized connectivity state exhibiting negative DMN-toother connections). The phenomenon of widespread polarization can be parsed more finely in spatial terms, and doing so also reveals
distinctions between patients and controls. Examples include the determination of each voxel’s “polarity participation rate” which is
its probability of being in the top (resp. bottom) third of its own activation profile at times when this condition holds for a large proportion
of voxels, i.e. when the whole brain is in a polarized state. We find that the spatial distribution of voxelwise polarity participation differs
significantly between patients and controls; in controls there are large clearly delineated regions characterized by very high polarity
participation rates, while in patients the larger and better defined regions are those that represent very low rates of polarity participation.
Another way to probe the time-varying spatial structure of polarized voxels is to recode (polarity code) voxel timeseries as {−1,0,1}
according to whether the voxel is in the bottom, middle or top third of its intrinsic activation profile at each TR. The polarity-coded
brain maps can then be clustered into a set of brainwide voxel co-polarization patterns, providing a spatially explicit parameterization
of polarity space in which subject trajectories can be studied. We find highly significant differences between patients and controls in
occupancy rates of the resulting clusters.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A. Participants, Preprocessing, Network Identification and Dynamic Functional Connectivity
We summarize below some basic information about data collection, preprocessing, network identification and computation of
dynamic functional connectivity. Details are available in [4]. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data (162 volumes
of echo planar imaging BOLD fMRI, TR = 2 sec.) was collected from 163 healthy controls (117 males, 46 females; mean age 36.9) and
151 age and gender matched patients with schizophrenia (114 males, 37 females; mean age 37.8) during eyes closed condition at 7
different sites across United States. After standard preprocessing, the fMRI data from all subjects was decomposed using group
independent component analysis (GICA) into 100 network spatial maps (http://icatb.sourceforge.net) of which 47 were identified as
functionally meaningful resting state networks (RSNs). Subject specific spatial maps (SMs) and timecourses (TCs) were obtained from
the group level spatial maps via spatiotemporal regression. The timecourses were detrended, orthogonalized with respect to estimated
subject motion parameters, then despiked and band-pass filtered into [0.05,0.15] Hz using a 5th order Butterworth filter. Dynamic
functional connectivity (dFNC) between RSN timecourses was estimated using a sliding window approach. Following protocols from
recent studies on dynamic connectivity [4], we used a tapered rectangular window length of 22 TRs (44 seconds), shifted 1TR forward
at a time and computed pairwise correlations between RSN time courses within these windows. Static, or traditional functional network
connectivity (FNC) simply uses a single untapered window of length 162TR, the length of the scan. The 47 functionally meaningful

networks retained from the 100 component GICA all into 5 broad functional domains: subcortical (SC, 5 networks), auditory (AUD, 2
networks); visual (VIS, 11 networks), sensorimotor (SM, 6 networks), cognitive control (CC, 13 networks), default mode network
(DMN, 7 networks), cerebella (CB, 2 networks).
Pre-processing of 4D volumes for the polarity analysis was identical to that for dFNC, except for omission of the standard spatial
smoothing step. This choice was made to control for cases in which a relatively small number of evenly distributed extremely high (or
low) intensity voxels distort polarity measurements for the regions they are distributed within.
B. Dynamic Polarity States, Polarity Metric and Polarity Participation Maps
We construct several measures intended to capture spatial patterns in the brain formed by the set of voxels that are either
simultaneously very highly activated or simultaneously minimally activated. These co-polarized voxels do not exclude voxel collections
that share correlative relationships, but they are far more general. Included in the set of voxels, for example, that are highly activated
during a given TR there would usually be a subset that rose together from an earlier TR, a subset that dropped together from an even
higher previous level of activation and a subset that are roughly unchanged from the previous TR. Which is to say that within the set of
highly activated voxels at a given TR can be, in a temporally localized sense, subsets consisting of correlated voxels, anti-correlated
voxels and uncorrelated voxels.
1)
Voxel Activation Profiles and Polarity Coding: The timeseries of each gray matter voxel 𝑣 ∈ 𝒱 is individually z-scored to create
a normalized (intrinsic) activation profile. Values in each z-scored timeseries are then discretized into discrete intrinsic activation
level (IALs), i.e. they are recoded as −1s, 0s or +1s according to whether they are in the lower third (𝑧 < −0.43, ‘Low Polar’),
middle third (𝑧 ∈ (−0.43,0.43), ‘Neutral’) or upper third (𝑧 > 0.43, ‘High Polar’) of the voxel’s intrinsic activation profile (see
Figure 2). The resulting discretized timeseries in 𝒜 = {−1,0, +1} ≡ {𝐿𝑜𝑤, 𝑁𝑒𝑢𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑙, 𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ} for each voxel will be referred to as
the its discretized intrinsic activation level timeseries, 𝐼𝐴𝐿𝑣 (𝑡).

subject; (Center) Same subject’s medial slice data through time where each voxel’s activation timeseries has been separately z-scored to recast the data
in a voxel-intrinsic, normalized form that provides a clearer view of which voxels are near the ceiling or the floor of their own activation profile at each
TR]; (Right) Discretized version of the middle panel in which voxel IAPs are recoded in {-1,0,+1} according to whether they are in the bottom third
of the IAP (𝑧 < −0.431), the middle third of the IAP (−0.431 ≤ 𝑧 ≤ 0.431) or top third (𝑧 > 0.431) as a rough parsing of the brain at each TR into
voxels near their own floors and ceilings of activation.

2)

Dynamic Polarity Regimes (dPRs): Every individual voxel intrinsic activation level timeseries assumes, by design, each of the
values −1, 0 and 1 exactly 1⁄3 of the time. This however provides no information about the proportion of voxels simultaneously
at the same IAL at any given TR. Switching from the individual voxel standpoint to the whole brain standpoint, we characterize
each TR by a length-3 vector ⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗
ℓ(𝑡) = (ℎ(𝑡), 𝑙(𝑡), 𝑛(𝑡)) , ℎ(𝑡), 𝑙(𝑡), 𝑛(𝑡) ∈ [0,1] , ℎ(𝑡) + 𝑙(𝑡) + 𝑛(𝑡) = 1 of proportions
where ℎ(𝑡) = #{𝑣: 𝐼𝐴𝐿𝑣 (𝑡) = 1}⁄|𝒱| , 𝑙(𝑡) = #{𝑣: 𝐼𝐴𝐿𝑣 (𝑡) = −1}⁄|𝒱| , 𝑛(𝑡) = #{𝑣: 𝐼𝐴𝐿𝑣 (𝑡) = 0}⁄|𝒱| are the proportion of
voxels at each intrinsic activation level at TR=𝑡. If we do not keep track of the entire history of each voxel, the number of voxels
in any of the three intrinsic activation levels observed at a given TR would follow a binomial distribution with 𝑝 = 1⁄3, 𝑛 = |𝒱|.
The expected number for any of the levels would be 𝑝𝑛 = 13|𝒱| and the expected proportion in each level would simply be
𝔼(ℎ), 𝔼(𝑙), 𝔼(𝑛) = 𝑝 = 1⁄3 . Empirically we see 𝜇(ℎ) = 0.333, 𝜇(𝑙) = 0.335, 𝜇(𝑛) = 0.332. Applying 𝑘 -means clustering
(Matlab’s built-in 𝑘-means function with 3 clusters, 3000 iterates, 300 replicates, Euclidean distance, number of clusters selected
by the elbow criterion) to all 50240 of these 3-vectors (one for each of 314 subjects at 160 TRs) suggest the brain dynamically
organizes into three very stylized polarity regimes (dPRs) (see Figure 6): a High-Polarized regime whose cluster centroid
(0.46,0.24,0.30) presents ℎ ≫ 1⁄3 , 𝑙 ≪ 1⁄3 and 𝑛~ 1⁄3 ; a Low-Polarized regime whose cluster centroid (0.23,0.46,0.31)
presents ℎ ≪ 1⁄3 , 𝑙 ≫ 1⁄3 and 𝑛~ 1⁄3 ; and a Non-Polarized or Equidistributed Regime whose cluster centroid
(0.33,0.33,0.34) presents ℎ~ 1⁄3 , 𝑙~ 1⁄3 and 𝑛~ 1⁄3 (see Figure 4).

3)

Polarity Metric: We also define a real-valued polarity metric. Since 𝔼(ℎ), 𝔼(𝑙) = 1⁄3 and the polarized states are characterized
by having both ℎ > 1⁄3 and 𝑙 < 1⁄3 , a given subject’s degree of polarization at 𝑇𝑅 = 𝑡 can be summarized with 𝛱(𝑡) =
−(ℎ_𝑧 (𝑡)𝑙_𝑧 (𝑡)), where ℎ𝑧 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑙𝑧 are z-scored versions of the timeseries ℎ(𝑡) and 𝑙(𝑡) respectively, recentered to have mean
0. Large positive values of ℎ𝑧 (resp. 𝑙𝑧 ) represent values of ℎ(𝑡) (resp. 𝑙(𝑡)) that are much larger than 1⁄3, while high magnitude
negative values of ℎ𝑧 (resp. 𝑙𝑧 ) represent values of ℎ(𝑡) (resp. 𝑙(𝑡)) that are much smaller than 1⁄3 . The most polarized
timepoints are those in which one of ℎ𝑧 or 𝑙𝑧 is large and positive, while the other is large and negative. So 𝛱(𝑡) is rising with
the degree of polarization at 𝑇𝑅 = 𝑡, is near zero when the brain is balanced between ℎ(𝑡), 𝑙(𝑡) and 𝑛(𝑡) and grows more negative
when both ℎ(𝑡) and 𝑙(𝑡) are simultaneously much larger or much smaller than 1⁄3 (brain is not polarized but also not well
balanced between ℎ(𝑡), 𝑙(𝑡) and 𝑛(𝑡)) (see Figure 3).

Figure 3 Using scalar valued measure 𝚷(𝒕) of time-varying whole-brain polarization we see that (Left) the oscillatory pattern in degree of polarity has
power decaying in frequency and no discernible peaks that would point to biological rhythms associated with respiration or heartbeat; (Right) The
value of 𝚷(𝒕) clearly separates for timepoints at which the whole brain is in the Non-Polarized dPR state (blue) vs. timepoints at which the whole brain
is one of the two polarized (Polarized-High, Polarized-Low) states (red).

C. Polarity Participation Maps (PPMs): The dPRs are crude summaries and capture nothing about the locations or identities of
voxels that contribute to the computed proportion of voxels in each of the three levels at a given TR, and thus nothing about the
overall role of specific voxels in producing the a subject’s polarized regimes. To capture this information we create a polarity
participation map (PPM) for each subject in which each voxel is assigned a value in [0,1] according to the proportion of polarized
dPR states it contributes to, i.e. the sum of the proportion of that subject’s Polarized-High states during which that voxel’s
𝐼𝐴𝐿𝑣 (𝑡) = 1 and the proportion of their Polarized-Low states during which the voxel’s 𝐼𝐴𝐿𝑣 = −1 (see Figure 4). Applying 𝑘means clustering (Matlab’s built-in 𝑘-means function with 2 clusters, 3000 iterates, 300 replicates, Euclidean distance, number of
clusters selected by the elbow criterion) to all 314 of these 60303-vectors (one for each of 314 subjects) yields clusters whose
centroids evidently represent different spatial distributions of highly participating voxel (Figure 9, bottom left).
1)

Network-Level Polarity Participation: To assess the role that different functional networks play in whole-brain polarized states,
we threshhold and binarize the 47 group-level network spatial maps and then average the value of each subject’s z-scored polarity
participation map restricted to the threshold-surviving voxels in each network spatial map (see Figure 10, bottom row).
Specifically, each group spatial map is z-scored (since scale in GICA spatial maps is arbitrary) and thresholded at 𝑧 ≥ 1.25 to
retain the only the top decile of voxels. The polarity participation rates are also z-scored and averaged, for each subject, over each
network’s threshold-surviving voxels. The measured network participation for a given subject and a given network can thus be
negative, indicating that the average voxel in that network participates in the subject’s whole-brain polarized states at a sub-mean
level.

to (Middle Left) single voxel discretized intrinsic activation levels (IALs) to (Top Left) whole brain dynamic polarity regimes (dPRs) into which this
voxel is recruited at a very high rate (83% of the time that the whole brain is in the Polarized-High or Polarized-Low state, each characterized by mean
of of the entire brain’s voxels are simultaneously either in the high or low (+1, -1) intrinsic activation levels, this voxel is one of the participating set
of co-polarized voxels. The average voxel only participates in fewer than half (43%) of a subject’s highly polarized states.

D. Dynamic Brainwide Co-Polarization Patterns (CoPPs): The low-dimensional dPRs give a rough sense of how overall counts of
co-polarized voxels vary through time and PPMs provide a time-averaged picture of which regions of the brain are most
commonly implicated in whole-brain polarized states. Neither approach, however, provides insight into how highly polarized
whole-brain states evolve and dissolve, nor what role they may play in longer whole-brain itineraries that involve more structured
or intricate spatial patterns of polarity-coded voxels. Toward this end we extract transient whole-brain patterns of co-polarization
in a voxel-intrisic analogy to whole-brain co-activation patterns (CAPs) employed in several published studies [16]. Replacing
each continuous voxel timeseries 𝑣(𝑡) with its discretized intrinsic activation level timeseries 𝐼𝐴𝐿𝑣 (𝑡) yields a representation of
the entire brain in 𝒜 = {−1,0, +1} ≡ {𝐿𝑜𝑤, 𝑁𝑒𝑢𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑙, 𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ} at each TR. Applying 𝑘-means clustering (Matlab built-in 𝑘-means
function with 13 clusters, 3000 iterates, 100 replicates, Euclidean distance, number of clusters selected by the elbow criterion) to
all 50240 of these |𝒱| = 6030-dimensional observations (one for each of 314 subjects at 160 TRs) spatially elaborates the crude
numerical counts/proportions captured by the 3-dimensional dynamic dPRs. The brainwide co-polarization patterns (CoPPs) that
emerge as centroids of these clusters indicate that the cruder dPRs are capturing spatially structured voxel-level arrangements
whose population-level occupancy rates are relatively uniform (Figure 11, top left). Among the CoPPs associated with TRs that are
assigned to one of the polarized dPR states are some that are pervasively polarized, i.e., the proportion of voxels simultaneously at
either High or Low levels is much higher than the ~45% or so in the associated dPR cluster centroid (see Figure 11, bottom left).
1)

Identification of the most ‘Strongly Polarized’ CoPPs: Although the samples being clustered are 60303-dimensional vectors of
−1’s 0’s and +1’s, the elements of the cluster centroids are averages in the continuous interval [−1, 1]. Due to the high
dimensionality of the samples (i.e., membership in a given cluster can arise predominantly from good matching of some arbitrary
collection of tens of thousands of voxels to other cluster members, while still leaving thousands of degrees of freedom), the
determination of what it means for one of these centroids to represent a “pervasively polarized” brain state is necessarily
somewhat subjective. We have decided on a criterion based loosely on the asymptotic distributions of sample means for a set of
identically distributed uniform discrete random variables under a convenient (but not entirely valid assumption) of independence.
The sample is quite large so the asymptotic framing is not entirely unreasonable. We will say that a CoPP represents a strongly
polarized state if the probability that the magnitude of the absolute mean |𝜇𝐶𝑜𝑃𝑃 | of its elements would have probability less than
𝛼 = 0.001 under a very conservative adaptation of above-stated model. The sign of 𝜇𝐶𝑜𝑃𝑃 in such a case determines if that CoPP
is positively or negatively polarized. Since voxels assume values +1,0 ans -1 with equal probability, i.e. 𝔼(𝐼𝐴𝐿𝑣 (𝑡)) = 0,
𝔼((𝐼𝐴𝐿𝑣 (𝑡) − 𝔼(𝐼𝐴𝐿𝑣 (𝑡))2 ) = 1, we assume by the central limit theorem that the within-cluster voxel means are distributed as
𝒩(0, √1𝑐 ) where 𝑐𝑖 is the number of observations in the cluster, and thus the global mean 𝜇𝑖 of the whole set of 𝑣 = 60303
𝑖
1
𝒩(0, √1𝑐 ) random variables is distributed as 𝒩(0, √𝑣𝑐
). The rescaling factor 𝑣𝑐𝑖 > 107 for all 𝑖, which makes the standard
𝑖
𝑖
deviation so close to 0 that absolute values as small as 10−5 are in the extreme 𝛼 = 0.001 tails of the distribution. To account
for the high level of spatiotemporal dependence and produce a distribution whose far tails do not include values with magnitude

smaller than 10−5 , we first reduce 𝑐𝑖 by treating all timepoints from a given subject as dependent, so that cluster 𝑖 is treated as
containing 𝑛𝑖 = 314𝑟𝑖 samples, where 𝑟𝑖 is the population-averaged occupancy rate of cluster 𝑖. We further assume, based on the
group spatial ICA (GICA) performed on this data [4] that there are 47 independent units of space (the set of “good” spatially
1
independent networks identified by the GICA). The test distribution for 𝜇𝑖 thus becomes 𝒩(0, √47𝑛
), a distribution with much

more conservative tails than 𝒩(0, √𝑣𝑐 ). Using the 𝛼 = 0.001 tails of this distribution as a threshold we identify 3 positively (see
𝑖
Figure 5) and 3 negatively polarized CoPPs.

time varying co-polarization patterns (CoPPs); (Middle) more structured but still strongly positively polarized co-polarization pattern; (Right)
extremely strongly and pervasively positively polarized CoPP.

E. Longer Itineraries in Polarity Space: We take two approaches to investigating forward-time CoPP itineraries:
1)

2)

Itineraries from Group-Averaged Transition Probabilities: We find the forward-time group-level most-probable itinerary from a
source CoPP 𝐶𝑖 through a set of subsequent distinct CoPPs 𝐶𝑗 , 𝐶𝑘 , 𝐶𝑙 , … where 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 ≠ 𝑘 ≠ 𝑙 ≠ ⋯ by using transition
probabilities computed at the group level: from 𝐶𝑖 the most probable forward-time transition out of 𝐶𝑖 at the group-averaged
level is to 𝐶𝑗 , and from 𝐶𝑗 the most probable transition is to 𝐶𝑘 etc. This process which can be extended until one of the elements
of the path repeats, at which point the remainder of the forward-time itinerary is determined by the segment that contains the
initial instance and the successor instance of the repeated element. Note that these are itineraries with respect to CoPP transitions
from one state to a new distinct state, not accounting for the probability of remaining in the presently occupied CoPP. For purposes
of interpretation it is important to keep in mind both that the reported itineraries are computed from group-level average transition
probabilities and that they are expressed in terms of successive distinct states rather than successive timepoints. We are employing
this approach to better understand how healthy and patient populations move through the polarity space (parameterized in terms
of CoPPs) and specifically to probe the role the most pervasively polarized states may be playing in overall brain function.
Sparse Convolutional Coding of CoPP Occupancy Timeseries: Another way to study longer sequences of CoPP occupancies is
to perform multichannel 1-dimensional convolutional sparse coding (CSC) of the symbolic timeseries of CoPP occupancies.
These are symbolic timeseries because although we are indexing the CoPPs with a set of nonnegative integers, the actual index
values have no numerical meaning: they can be permuted, replaced with large negative numbers, replaced with letters or words
or any other way of identifying a given CoPP with some tag or label. This is a slightly unconventional type of timeseries to
approach with convolutional feature extraction techniques, however it can be handles by treating the 1D symbolic timeseries in
a 𝑁-letter alphabet as an 𝑁-channel binary 1D timeseries, which is effectively a multivariate timeseries in which exactly one of
the channels (or univariate consitutent timeseries) takes value 1 at every timestep, while all others are 0 at that timestep. This
encodes the occupancies in channel form and allows the use of convolutional sparse coding algorithms, such as those developed
for the the publicly available Python-based sparse coding package Sporco [17]. Based on initial exploratory work,
resource/efficiency considerations and concern with ease of interpretation we used Sporco’s convolutional basis pursuit denoising
(CBPDN) dictionary learning algorithm to represent the CoPP symbolic timeseries data with a dictionary of 64 mutichannel (in
this case 13 channels, one for each CoPP) elements of temporal duration 11TRs. The elements represent replicable translationinvariant features of the mutichannel timeseries data that combine additively at each timepoint to reproduce the local properties
of the signal. The elements of the dictionary are also, as an entire set, optimized so that only a small number of the elements are
making the largest proportion of nonzero contributions to signal reconstruction, e.g. they are translation-invariant features, built
from a nonlinear feature extraction algorithm, that ultimately reproduce the data additively with the largest rate of nontrivial
contribution coming from a subset of the features.

F. Statistical Analyses: All reported schizoprenia or symptom effects from regression analyses were obtained from mutiple
regressions in which age gender and mean frame displacement (motion) were included as nuisance variables, i.e. the reported
effects are already corrected for age, gender and motion. In the case of symptom effect, the reported results for a specific category
of symptom, e.g. positive symptoms of schizophrenia, are also corrected for confounding effects of the remaining symptom
categories, e.g. negative and general symtoms.

RESULTS

A. Dynamic Polarity Regimes and Schizophrenia
We find that occupancy of very polarized brain states is strongly correlated with diagnostic status (see Figure 6): SZ diagnosis has
a significant negative effect on occupancy of both the Polarized-High (𝛽 = −0.05, 𝑝 < 1.1 × 10−13 ) and the Polarized-Low (𝛽 =
−0.04, 𝑝 < 2 × 10−11 ) states. Higher scores on a symptom inventory [18] further suppress polarity, with positive symptoms
(including psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations) exhibiting significant suppressive effects on the Polarized-High
(𝛽 = −0.03, 𝑝 < 0.003) and Polarized-Low (𝛽 = −0.02, 𝑝 < 0.05).

Figure 6 (Top Left) The three whole-brain dynamic polarity regimes: Polarized-High (46% voxels high, 24% voxels low, 30% voxels neutral),
Polarized-Low (23% voxels high, 46% voxels low, 31% voxels neutral), Non-Polarized/Balanced (33% voxels high, 33% voxels low, 34% voxels
neutral); (Top Right) Group-wise mean occupancy rates of the three dynamic polarity regimes; the non-polarized/balanced regime is the most
common for all groups, with evident differences between patients and controls in all regimes; (Bottom Right) In regression model correcting for age,
gender and mean frame displacement (motion), the effect of schizophrenia diagnosis on occupancy of the polarized states is negative and highly
significant while the effect of schizophrenia diagnosis on occupancy of the balanced state is positive and highly significant; (Bottom Right) Among
schizophrenia patients, the effect of positive symptoms (including delusions, hallucination and grandiosity) intensity on polarity regime occupancies
echoes the broad effect of schizophrenia itself suggesting that the difference between schizophrenia patients and controls the neighboring may be
driven largely by positive symptomology, including the key psychotic symptoms: delusions and hallucinations. Negative schizophrenia symptoms
such as bunted affect and general psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression did not have significant effects on the polarity regime
occupancy rates.

B. Dynamic Polarity Regimes and Functional Network Connectivity
Since the original decomposition into networks is typically based on scale-invariant measures such as correlations (seed-based
methods) or dependence (independent component analysis (ICA)), conventional scan-length functional network connectivity (FNC)
and also dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) computed on sliding windows through the network timecourses both
implicitly incorporate information from what we are calling voxel activation profiles. These initial decompositions are followed by
evaluations of network connectivity that also tend to rely on correlation, a scale-invariant quantity. Using the five time-resolved
connectivity states reported in earlier work from this dataset [19] we probe the relationship between polarity and time-varying
connectivity by investigating the occupancy rates of the polarized dPR states within windows characterized by each of the five
different dynamic connectivity states (see Figure 7). For each dFNC state, we perform a two-sample t-test on the subject-level
occupancy rate of polarized dPR states during windows characterized by that dFNC state vs. subject-level occupancy rates of
polarized dPR states on all windows. This is assessing group-wise, the degree to which polarized dPR states occupancies during the
22TR windows characterized by any specific dFNC state are distinguished from other 22TR windows in a subject’s scan. The

polarized dPR occupancy rates are at the subject-level, computed window-wise for each of the 22TR windows characterized by a
given dFNC states for that subject. The number of such windows per subject will vary, so the number of polarized dPR occupancy
rates recorded for different subjects for any given dFNC state can be different, and when this count differs between two subject the the
number of occupancy rates recorded for those subjects from windows characterized by any other dFNC state will also be different.
This somewhat cumbersome procedure allows for testing the role of polarized dPRs in realizing each dFNC state, correcting for the
tendency of a given subject to be in polarized dPR states more generally. And since the t-tests are done at the group level, i.e. they are
tests of the entire set of polarized dPR occupancy rates associated with windows characterized by a given dFNC state for all healthy
controls (resp. all SZ patients) vs. the entire set of polarized dPR occupancy rates associated with windows characterized by all other
dFNC states for all healthy controls (resp. all SZ patients) it is accounting for the different baseline polarized dPR occupancy rates for
each group HCs have a higher baseline occupancy rate for the polarized dPR states. We find that for both SZs and HCs, polarized dPR
state occupancy is significantly elevated during occupancy of the hyperconnected dFNC state and the highly modularized dFNC state
in which the default mode network (DMN) is non-correlated with other networks. The opposite holds for the disconnected dFNC state
and the semi-modularized dFNC state in which the DMN is anti-correlated with other networks: polarized dPR state occupancy is
significantly depressed during occupancy of these two dFNC states. The highly modularized dFNC state with negative DMN-to-other
connectivity is the one for which polarity plays a very different role in the patient and control populations. Polarized state occupancy
during occupancy of this dFNC state is significantly elevated in controls, and significantly depressed in patients (see Figure 7 for all
effects of polarity on dFNC occupancy, evaluated separately for SZ and HC).

blue) boxes; significant elevation (red) or depression (blue) of brain polarity during windows characterized by each dFNC state are underneath each
state.

We also investigated the role of polarized dPR occupancy rates on traditional “static” functional network connectivity. In this case
we use the standard full-scan dPR occupancy rates employed in most other sections of this paper, i.e. for this analysis the polarized
dPR occupancy rate for a given subject is number of occupancies of either the high or low polarized state for that subject, divided by
the total number of TRs) and consider their effect on pairwise network connectivity measures also computed as correlations between
network timecourses over the whole length of the scan. Our findings suggest that many reliably observed differences between
schizophrenia patients and controls in functional network connectivity may actually be strongly mediated through the role of wholebrain polarization, that the ability of the brain to organize itself into pervasively polarized states (a phenomenon that can have
implications for connectivity but correlative relationships can exist within and across bands of intrinsic voxel activation levels)
influences the measured correlative relationships that we observe in SZ and HC populations, and also proxies for underlying
neurobiological and neurovascular facts that play strong roles in organizing network interactions and convergence into transient highly
polarized states. Schizophrenia diagnosis is very significantly negatively correlated with occupancy of polarized dPR states, but in a
multiple regression of FNC measures on schizophrenia diagnosis and polarized dPR state occupancy rate (along with the usual
covariates: age, gender and mean frame displacement), the strong univariate effects of polarized dPR occupancy rate on FNC

measures largely survive correction for the role of SZ diagnosis while the strong univariate effects of SZ diagnosis are highly
disrupted, leaving only a small set of significant SZ effects after polarized dPR occupancy rates are accounted for (see Figure 8).

C. Polarity Participation Maps and Schizophrenia
While schizophrenia patients (especially those with strong positive symptomology are much more likely to pass through periods
during which a large proportion of voxels are simultaneously near the ceiling or floor of their own intrinsic activation profiles, the
number of ways that proportion of voxels can distribute over space, even subject to local smoothness constraints, is combinatorially
overwhelming. For example there are more than 60,30330,151 = 6 ∙ 104∙30,150 = 6 ∙ 10121,400 sets of 30,151 voxels that could be
responsible for a given case of the “High-Polarized” state in which ~50% of the voxels are simultaneously at their intrinsic “high”
level. Even subject to local smoothness constraints, the participating voxel collections could be drifting spatially between
instantiations of the Polarized-High state, yielding relatively uniform, spatially unstructured, time and subject-averaged voxel
participation rates. We found however that, on average, there are well-delineated regions in which the most highly participating voxels
are concentrated and other regions consisting of voxels unlikely to be part of a whole-brain Polarized-High or Polarized-Low state.
Within the broad patterns of voxel participation that hold at the population level, there are also significant differences between
schizophrenia patients and controls (Figure 9, top right). The subject-level PPMs robustly fell into two clusters with distinct patterns
of voxel participation and highly significant differences in occupancy between patients and controls. The two clusters of PPMs
present very different spatial patterns of voxel participation in polarized dPR states. Among other evident differences there are default
mode, parietal, cingulate and visual regions that participate in whole-brain polarization at very high rates in Cluster 1 but contribute
little to whole-brain polarization in Cluster 2 (see Figure 9, bottom row). The occupancy of both PPM clusters is strongly affected by
the diagnostic status of the subject: SZ has a highly significant negative effect (𝛽 = −0.294, 𝑝 < 2.6 × 10−08 ) on occupancy of
Cluster 1 (resp. a highly significant positive effect (𝛽 = 0.294, 𝑝 < 2.6 × 10−08) on occupancy of Cluster 2).

subjects split evenly between the two clusters while schizophrenia patients occupy Cluster 2 much more often than Cluster 1.

D. Polarity Participation Maps, Functional Networks and Schizophrenia
The highest magnitude voxels in GICA functional network spatial maps are, by construction, nearly mutually spatially disjoint.
This permits easy assessment of network-level polarity participation by computing the mean polarity participation rate of suprathreshold voxels in each network spatial map. We chose to threshold z-scored network spatial maps at 𝑧̅ = 1.25 (𝑝(𝑧 > 𝑧̅) < 0.1) and
also z-scored the PPMs, mapping them from [0,1] into (−∞, ∞). The lowest network-level polarity participation was in subcortical
networks (other than the thalamus), the inferior temporal and frontal gyri and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (see Figure 10).
Significant effects of SZ diagnosis on the network-level polarity participation (p<0.05, after false discovery rate (FDR) correction of
multiple comparisons) were broadly evident, with positive effects clustering in subcortical cognitive control networks, negative effects
in the auditory, visual and sensorimotor networks (see Figure 10). These effects track in sign and significance with SZ effects on internetwork connectivity (see Figure 8 above).

E. Dynamic Brainwide Co-Polarization Patterns and Schizophrenia
Brainwide co-polarization patterns, the centroids of clustered 3D polarity-coded volumes (e.g. ⋃𝑣∈𝒱 IALv (𝑡) for TR=𝑡) from all
subjects and timepoints, are much more spatially resolved than the dPR 3-vectors and more temporally resolved than the scan-length
summary PPMs. We find that these CoPPs are quite spatially structured, include strong and spatially pervasive polarized states (see
Figure 11) and at the population scale, all are occupied at similar rates (see Figure 11). Occupancy of more polarized CoPPs exhibit
strong negative SZ effects however.

Figure 11 Polarity coded 3D volumes distribute into 13 clusters, all of which exceed 6% occupancy at the population level (top left); among these
clusters are two whose centroids are pervasively strongly polarized (bottom row, first and second column); SZ has a significant negative (𝑝 < 0.05
(FDR)) effect on occupancy of the two most strongly polarized CoPPs (bars at 𝑥 = 11 and 𝑥 = 12 in top-center bar plot); within the patient
population there is also a significant negative effect of positive symptomology, including the key psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations)
on occupancy of the most strongly and pervasively polarized states (right-most bars in top right bar plot). The positive symptom effect within the
patient population is significant at the raw 𝛼 = 0.05 level without surviving the stronger multiple comparison threshold.

1) Longer Itineraries of Co-Polarization Patterns and Schizophrenia
Group-average CoPP transition probabilities reveal that schizophrenia patients move through polarity space, on average, very
differently than controls. Considering the longer itineraries in which the most pervasively polarized CoPPs are embedded reveals that
their greater probability of realization in healthy controls reflects, in part, a more fluid and diverse sampling of the space of whole
brain polarization patterns (Figure 12). Controls exhibit a greater “dynamic range” than patients, a finding consistent with several
other recent results [20]. In this setting however, the extra dynamic range puts controls repeatedly in parts of the polarity space that are
proximal to more pervasive forms of both positive and negative polarization, increasing the odds of repeatedly entering those states. In
healthy controls the most probable exit itinerary from any CoPP has a short transient of at most one intermediate state, followed by
entry into the absorbing length-9 periodic orbit joining the most strongly polarized states of both valencies. In patients, the most
probable exit itinerary from any CoPP passes through at most four intermediate states before entering one of two absorbing periodic
orbits, each an alternating oscillation between either two non-polarized CoPPs or one non-polarized and one mildly polarized CoPP.
Some care is required in interpreting these different group-level itineraries: 1. They are expressed in terms of successive distinct states
rather than successive timepoints; 2. The transition probabilities are group averages that need not be quantitatively or ordinally
realized in individual subjects; 3. These are statistical itineraries based on stepwise highest probability transitions and need not be
perfectly realized in any fixed set of simulated CoPP occupancy timeseries generated by the full transition probability matrix for either
group, i.e. there is non-negligible probability at each step of doing something other than staying in the present state or transitioning to
the most probable subsequent distinct state, which makes these itineraries more analogous to trendlines though a pointcloud than to the
attractors of a (stochastically perturbed) deterministic dynamical system.

DISCUSSION

We report results about large-scale spatial BOLD patterns formed by voxel activation timeseries that have each been normalized
with respect to their own means and variances (i.e., individually z-scored). Our findings indicate that the healthy brain, through some
combination of neural, vascular and neurovascular coupling factors, is strongly characterized by the degree to which it exhibits periods
of spatially pervasive elevated (resp. depressed) vn-BOLD activation (see Figure 6 and Figure 11). The relative inability of
schizophrenia patients to organize this level of pervasive polarization is extremely statistically significant (𝑝 < 10−11 ). There are also
significant differences between healthy and patient populations in the spatial distribution of voxel participation in these states of
pervasive brain polarization with stronger structured regions of highly participating voxels among healthy controls (Figure 9). This
large-scale brain polarization phenomenon exhibits tractable and clinically relevant interactions with familiar connectivity-based
targets of fMRI analysis: functional network spatial maps, functional network connectivity and dynamic functional network
connectivity. The voxels most drawn into whole-brain polarization states distribute differently over group-level GICA spatial maps in
patients and controls (see Figure 10): auditory, visual and sensorimotor networks contain more voxels with high polarity participation
rates in controls than patients whereas subcortical and cerebellar networks contain more voxels with high polarity participation rates in
patients than controls. There are also significant relationships between polarization and short-timescale functional network
connectivity states (Figure 7), relationships that are predominantly unmediated by clinical status with the single exception of the
highly modularized state with negative correlations between default-mode and other networks. This dynamic connectivity state is
significantly more occupied by controls under conditions of higher than average polarization, while its occupancies by patients are
both more numerous and occur under conditions of lower than average levels of whole-brain polarization. In traditional “static” FNC
the largely unmediated relationship between polarization and the structure of network correlations/anti-correlations persists (Figure 8).
Polarization both guides/constrains and is built from underlying networks and their connectivity. We show that the phenomenon of
dynamic, large-scale spatially pervasive polarization in vn-BOLD fMRI is strongly suppressed among those with diagnosed
schizophrenia however, with significant intensification of the suppressive effect among patients with higher positive symptomology
scores (Figure 6). Positive symptoms include the core psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, delusions and hallucinations. We have
also shown that patients and controls exhibit very different patterns of voxel participation in the polarized TRs (Figure 9). The
difference in spatial patterns of “polarity participation” between patients and controls is also present at the network scale. Again it is
not clear whether this arises more from voxel effects aggregating into network effects or whether coherent network behavior is
shaping most of the voxel participation patterns. Drilling into the transient spatial patterns of discretized voxel IALs yields a set of 13
whole brain co-polarization patterns (CoPPs) that capture, among other things, multiple ways the collection of voxels simultaneously
at a given intrinsic activation level (IAL) distribute spatially at timepoints when the whole brain occupies the corresponding dPR state
(e.g. voxels with IAL=1 when the whole brain is occupying the polarized-high dPR state). The most strongly polarized CoPPs are
significantly more occupied by controls than patients which is consistent with results from the coarse polarity summary provided by
dPR state occupancies (Figure 11). However, with CoPPs, we also see group-level evidence of a healthy circuit itinerary in polarity
space that cycles through the maximally positively polarized CoPP, progressing through four CoPPs with increasing presence and
strength of negatively polarized regions until reaching the maximally negatively polarized CoPPs and returning again to the
maximally positively polarized CoPP through three intermediate transition states. Using the group-averaged transition probabilities for
healthy subjects, i.e. tracing from the most strongly positively polarized CoPP using the highest group-average probability forwardtime transition (to a different state) and continuing in this manner leads through the most strongly negatively polarized CoPP and then
to back to the most strongly positively polarized CoPP again, presenting a group-level most probable healthy itinerary through polarity
space accounting for 9 of the 13 CoPPs, including the most strongly polarized states. For schizophrenia patients the group-level most
probable forward-time trajectory out of the maximally positively polarized CoPP never recovers a significant level of polarity, either
positive or negative, instead alternating between two non-polarized states (Figure 12).
There are many neurobiological and vascular factors that could be contributing to the observed tendency of the healthy brain to
organize itself toward globally polarized vn-BOLD states, and multiple pathways by which this convergence fails to materialize as
fully or as frequently among schizophrenia patients. The inability to “fully polarize” has both locally structured and global
manifestations (note that both the strongly polarized structured CoPPs and the strongly pervasively polarized CoPPs in Figure 11 are
significantly more occupied by controls, and further, in Figure 12, that strongly polarized structured states are precursors to strongly
pervasively polarized state in the attracting orbit for healthy controls). This is simply to point out that the phenomenon we have
observed manifests on both local and more global scales, and its disruption in schizophrenia patients is evident at both of these scales.
In sum, the proposed approach provides a powerful new perspective on the disruption of brain function, represents a novel way of
studying resting fMRI data that does not rely on the standard network-based paradigm, and has the potential to lead to additional
biomarkers of brain disease.
