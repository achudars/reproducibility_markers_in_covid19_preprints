Abstract
Rationale. The dopamine system is thought to be important in incentive salience attribution, where motivational value is
assigned to a cue that predicts an appetitive reinforcer (sign-tracking), however, dopamine’s role may change with
extended training.
Objectives. We tested the effects of selective dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptor antagonism on the expression of
Pavlovian conditioned approach after extended Pavlovian conditioned approach (PCA) training. We also tested the
hypothesis that locomotor sensitization would accelerate the phenotypic shift to sign-tracking.
Methods. 24 male Long-Evans rats were subjected to 20 PCA sessions in which one lever (CS+, 10 s) predicted 0.2 mL
sucrose delivery and the other lever (CS–) did not. SCH-23390 or eticlopride were administered prior to behavioral tests
at doses of 0, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/kg (s.c.). In a subsequent experiment, rats were exposed to vehicle or 2 mg/kg
amphetamine (i.p.) for 7 days (n = 12/group). After a 10-day incubation period, they were subjected to PCA training for
16 sessions.
Results. The D1 antagonist SCH-23390 reduced locomotor activity and port entries during inter-trial intervals, but the D2
antagonist eticlopride selectively reduced CS+ port entries in goal-trackers , i.e. animals motivated towards the
reinforcer. Locomotor sensitization had no effect on the acquisition of sign-tracking.
Conclusions. A commonly used dose of SCH-23390 exhibited off-target locomotor effects and D2 receptors were not
required for expression of sign-tracking after extended training. Amphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization did not
enhance acquisition of sign-tracking behavior, suggesting that the sensitivity of the dopamine system does not drive
acquisition of sign-tracking behavior.

Introduction

sign-trackers assign motivational value to the CS.

Dopamine signalling has been heavily implicated in both the
acquisition and expression of incentive salience, where motivational value is assigned to a cue that predicts an appetitive reinforcer (Berridge, 2007; Chow et al., 2016; Flagel et al.,
2011, 2007; Fraser and Janak, 2017). Incentive salience is typically studied using a Pavlovian conditioned approach (PCA) or
‘autoshaping’ task, where a lever conditioned stimulus (CS) is
paired with an appetitive reinforcer. When the CS is presented,
sign-tracking animals approach the CS directly, while goaltracking animals approach the location where the reinforcer
will be presented (Berridge and Robinson, 2003). Both signand goal-trackers learn the CS-reinforcer association, but only

A number of studies have described a crucial role for
dopamine in incentive salience attribution (Table 1). Antagonism of D1-like dopamine receptors (D1 and D5; hereafter ‘D1’) disrupted acquisition of sign-tracking (Chow et al.,
2016; Roughley and Killcross, 2019) and reduced expression of
sign-tracking (Clark et al., 2013). Infusing the D1 antagonist
SCH-23390 into the nucleus accumbens core immediately after PCA sessions impaired the acquisition of approach behavior towards an appetitive CS (Dalley et al., 2005) and intraaccumbal amphetamine augmented behavioral responses to an
appetitive cue during Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (Peciña
and Berridge, 2013). Moreover, systemic injections of a nonselective dopamine antagonist impaired expression of sign-

tracking but not goal-tracking (Saunders and Robinson, 2012).
Together, these findings suggest that dopamine signalling,
particularly at D1 receptors, is important for incentive salience
attribution. Several studies have also implicated the D2-like
dopamine receptors (D2, D3, and D4; hereafter ‘D2’) in incentive salience. Systemic pretreatment with antipsychotics that
inhibit D2 receptors impaired the acquisition of sign-tracking,
but not goal-tracking (Danna and Elmer, 2010), though antipsychotic pretreatment does not change the expression of
previously learned sign-tracking behavior (Bédard et al., 2011).
Selective D2 receptor antagonists, such as raclopride and eticlopride, impaired performance of previously acquired signtracking and goal-tracking (Fraser et al., 2016; Lopez et al.,
2015). Although a D2 agonist also impaired performance of

Clark et al. (2013)

Lopez et al. (2015)

sign-tracking, it did not affect goal-tracking (Lopez et al.,
2015). These results sit in some tension with other findings
that eticlopride administered intermittently during acquisition
impaired goal-tracking but not sign-tracking or that eticlopride administered daily during acquisition impaired the expression but not acquisition of goal-tracking (Roughley and
Killcross, 2019).
One possible explanation that the role of dopamine varies
across training. Sign-trackers show greater expression of D1
receptor mRNA during the first session of PCA training than
goal-trackers (Flagel et al., 2007). In contrast, goal-trackers
exhibit greater dopamine-related transcriptional activity than
sign-trackers in later sessions (Flagel et al., 2007). This may
explain why administering eticlopride during a 14-day PCA pro-

tocol impaired goal-tracking (Chow et al., 2016), but administering eticlopride after 4 PCA sessions impaired sign-tracking
(Lopez et al., 2015). These results suggest that extended training alters the role of the dopamine system in sign-tracking and
goal-tracking.
The locomotor sensitization protocol involves exposing animals to a psychostimulant, such as amphetamine, over a period
of time and produces long-lasting changes in dopamine signalling rendering the rats more sensitive to dopaminergic manipulations (Downs and Eddy, 1932; Kalivas and Stewart, 1991;
Segal and Mandell, 1974). Prior studies have examined the influence of locomotor sensitization on sign- and goal-tracking.
Some have found enhanced sign-tracking responses (Robinson
et al., 2015; Wyvell and Berridge, 2001) and others found enhanced goal-tracking responses (Simon et al., 2008). These
studies may suggest opposing effects on incentive salience, but
are difficult to directly compare due to procedural differences.
For example, whether sensitization was induced before or after
Pavlovian conditioning and whether animals received 7, 8 or 14
PCA sessions (Robinson et al., 2015; Simon et al., 2008; Wyvell
and Berridge, 2001). Nonetheless, these studies suggest that
locomotor sensitization has the potential to alter the acquisition of incentive salience, especially since dopamine is more

important for sign-tracking early in acquisition (Clark et al.,
2013; Flagel et al., 2007).
Recent work from our laboratory has shown that a subset of
rats will show a phenotypic shift from goal-tracking to signtracking (Srey et al., 2015; Villaruel and Chaudhri, 2016). This
phenotypic shift typically takes places after 16 or more sessions
of training when using an alcohol cue (Srey et al., 2015; Villaruel and Chaudhri, 2016). However, several previous studies
have used fewer than 10 PCA sessions (Fraser et al., 2016; Lopez
et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2015). Since the role of dopamine
may change with extended training (Clark et al., 2013; Flagel
et al., 2007), we studied the effect of selective D1 or D2 antagonism on the expression of sign-tracking and goal-tracking
behavior after extended training (20 sessions). We expected
that both D1 and D2 antagonism would reduce sign-tracking
and that D2 antagonism would reduce sign-tracking and goaltracking. We then gave a separate cohort of rats a sensitizing
regimen of amphetamine and subjected them to PCA training
for 16 sessions. We expected this to facilitate acquisition of
sign-tracking.

Methods
Animals
Subjects were 48 experimentally naïve male Long-Evans rats
weighing 220-240 g on arrival (Charles River). Rats were initially pair-housed in plastic cages (44.5 × 25.8 × 21.7 cm) containing Teklad Sani Chip bedding, a nylabone, a tunnel, and
shredded paper in a climate-controlled (21°C) vivarium on a 12
h:12 h light:dark cycle (lights on at 7am). Rats were allowed
to acclimate to the colony room for at least 3 days before being singly-housed and handled for 7 days. Rats had free access
to food and water in their home-cage throughout the experiments. All procedures were approved by the Animal Research
Ethics Committee at Concordia University and performed in accordance with guidelines from the Canadian Council on Animal
Care. See Table 2 for details of animals, reagents, and equipment.

Apparatus
Behavioral training was conducted using a 12 identical conditioning chambers (30.5 x 31.8 x 29.2 cm, Med Associates).
Each chamber was contained within a sound-attenuating cubicle with a fan to provide ventilation and background noise
(70-75 dB). Each chamber had a white houselight in the center
near the ceiling of the left wall (as viewed by the experimenter).
The right wall had a fluid port and head entry detector located
above the floor. A 20 mL syringe was placed on a syringe pump
outside the cubicle and connected to the port with polyethylene
tubing. A retractable lever was placed on either side of the port
and these would serve as conditioning stimuli. A PC running
Med-PC IV controlled presentation of stimuli and recorded responses. For open field locomotor behavior, we used four 39 x

42 x 50 cm arenas (Coulbourn Instruments) housed in sound
attenuating boxes and Tru Scan 2.0.

Experiment 1: Effect of dopamine antagonists on expression of sign- and goal-tracking
Home-cage sucrose.
To familiarize rats (n = 24) with sucrose, they were given 48
h of free home-cage access to 10% sucrose. A pre-weighed
cylinder with 90 mL sucrose and a regular bottle of water
were placed on their home-cage. After 24 h, bottles were reweighed, refilled, and replaced for another 24 h. Rats consumed all, or nearly all, the sucrose.
Habituation.
Rats were then habituated to the conditioning chambers. On
the first day, rats were habituated to transport by being placed
on a trolley, taken to the testing room, handled, weighed, and
left in the room for 20 min before being returned to the colony
room. On the second day, rats were placed in the chambers,
and there was a programmed 2 min delay before the houselights were switched on for a 20 min session. Port entries were
counted, but had no programmed consequences.
Pavlovian conditioned approach.
Rats then underwent 20 sessions of PCA training. Each PCA session involved 20 trials, with 10 CS+ trials (paired with sucrose
delivery) and 10 CS- trials (no sucrose). Each trial consisted of
a 10 s Pre-CS interval, a 10 s CS lever presentation, and a 10 s
Post-CS interval. One of the two levers was designated as the
CS+ lever and the other lever as the CS- lever. These were counterbalanced so that for half of the rats the CS+ lever was on the
left of the fluid port and for the other half the CS+ lever was on
the right of the fluid port. For a CS+ trial, but not a CS- trial, 6
s of syringe pump operation began at the onset of the Post-CS
interval to deliver 0.2 mL of sucrose. The inter-trial interval
(ITI), which did not include the Pre-CS, CS, or Post-CS intervals, was set at 60, 120, or 180 s (mean ITI duration = 120 s).
The ITI order of CS+ and CS- trials was randomized. Sessions
included a 2 min delay before the houselight was switched on
for a 52-min PCA test session.
For each session, a Pavlovian Conditioned Approach (PCA)
score was calculated from response bias, probability difference,
and latency score (Table 3; Meyer et al. (2012)). Rats were classified as sign-trackers if their mean PCA score was ≥ 0.5 for
PCA sessions 19 and 20. PCA scores ≤ -0.5 were classified as
goal-trackers and PCA scores between -0.5 and 0.5 were intermediates (Ahrens et al., 2016; Meyer et al., 2012).
Dopamine antagonist tests.
The effect of dopamine antagonists on the expression of conditioned responding was tested using a within-subjects design, with dose order counterbalanced using a Latin square design. First, to test the effect of the D1 antagonist SCH-23390,
rats were given an injection of saline vehicle, 0.01 mg/kg, or
1 mg/kg SCH-23390 (1 mL/kg, s.c.) 15 min before a test session. Test conditions were identical to training conditions, but
no syringes were placed on the pump and no sucrose was delivered. Rats were given at least one day of normal training
between tests to allow them to return to baseline levels of responding. After the completion of testing for SCH-23390, the
testing procedure was repeated, but rats received saline vehicle, 0.01 mg/kg, or 0.1 mg/kg eticlopride. Previous studies have
shown 0.01 mg/kg SCH-23390 or eticlopride to be an effective
dose (Chow et al., 2016; Sciascia et al., 2014) and pilot studies
using a lower dose (1 µg/kg SCH-23390 or eticlopride) did not
show any effect on sign- or goal-tracking.

Training Session

Figure 1. Sign-trackers and goal-trackers acquired distinct behaviors during Pavlovian PCA training sessions. (a) Rats classified as sign-trackers (ST; n = 14)
interacted most with a tactile lever cue that predicted 10% sucrose delivery (CS+), while goal-trackers (GT; n = 6) and intermediates (Int.; n = 4) produced fewer
CS+ lever activations. (b) The overall level of interaction with a non-predictive lever cue (CS-) remained low throughout 20 sessions of training. (c) Normalized
CS+ port entries (CS+ port entries minus Pre-CS+ port entries) were highest in goal-trackers. (d) Normalized CS– port entries (CS– port entries minus Pre-CS–
port entries) remained low throughout training. Each cue lever was available for 10 trials for 10 s per trial (total of 100 s/session). Data are means ± SEM.

Open field locomotor testing.
After testing the effects of SCH-23390 and eticlopride on the
expression of Pavlovian conditioned approach, we examined
the effects of these antagonists on locomotor behavior in an
open field (see Table 3 for definition of variables). On the first
day, rats were exposed to the locomotor chambers for a 45-min
habituation session. The next day, rats were randomly allocated to receive vehicle, 0.01 mg/kg, or 0.1 mg/kg SCH-23390
(1 mL/kg, s.c.) 15 min before the locomotor session (n = 8/dose).
On a separate day, rats were randomly allocated to receive vehicle, 0.01 mg/kg, or 0.1 mg/kg eticlopride (1 mL/kg, s.c., n =
8/dose) 15 min before the locomotor session.

Experiment 2: Effect of locomotor sensitization on the
acquisition of sign- and goal-tracking
Amphetamine exposure.
Rats (n = 24) were first habituated to experimental procedures.
They were given a saline injection (1 mL/kg, i.p.) immediately
before being placed in the locomotor chamber for a 30 min open
field locomotor session. After the locomotor session, they were
immediately placed in conditioning chambers for a 20 min habituation session, which was identical to the habituation session in Experiment 1. Rats were then randomly allocated to
vehicle or amphetamine groups (n = 12/group). For the next
7 consecutive days, rats received either 1 mL/kg vehicle or 2
mg/kg amphetamine i.p. immediately before a 30 min locomotor session and 20 min exposure to the conditioning chamber.

Doses were based on previous studies (Robinson et al., 2015).
Incubation and home-cage sucrose exposure.
Behavioral training began 10 days after the last amphetamine
injection. For the first 7 days, rats were left undisturbed except
for normal husbandry activities. On days 8-10, rats received 48
h of home-cage sucrose exposure.
Pavlovian conditioned approach.
After incubation and home-cage sucrose exposure, rats received 14 sessions of PCA training in the conditioning chambers
using procedures identical to those described for Experiment 1.
Sensitization test.
After PCA training, rats were tested for locomotor sensitization. All rats were given a 0.75 mg/kg amphetamine challenge
(Robinson et al., 2015) immediately before a 30 min open field
locomotor session.
Statistical Analysis and Material Availability.
Data were analysed using SPSS 24 (IBM, NY, USA). ANOVA with
Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc comparisons and t-tests were
used. Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were applied to degrees
of freedom following a significant Mauchly’s test of sphericity with ε< 0.75. Following violations of ANOVA assumptions
for some locomotor measures in Experiment 1, the KruskalWallace test was used. Raw data and Med-PC code will be made
available on Figshare.

SCH-23390, produced dose-dependent reductions on CS+ lever activations made by sign-trackers (n = 14). CS+ lever activations by intermediates (n = 4) were
reduced at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. (b) SCH-23390 produced a dose-dependent reduction normalized CS+ port entries in goal-trackers (n = 6). (c) However, SCH-23390
also had dose-dependent off-target effects on ITI port entries. (d) The selective D2 antagonist, eticlopride, reduced CS+ lever activations by sign-trackers at a dose
of 0.1 mg/kg. (e) Eticlopride significantly reduced normalized CS+ port entries made by goal-trackers at both doses and reduced CS+ port entries by intermediates
at 0.1 mg/kg. (f) Eticlopride did not have significant effects on ITI port entries at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg but did reduce ITI port entries at 0.1 mg/kg. ITIs comprised
42 min of each session. Data are means ± SEM. * p < 0.05 for Bonferroni corrected post-hoc comparisons compared to vehicle. # p < 0.05 for Bonferroni corrected

Results
Experiment 1: Effect of Dopamine Antagonists on Expression of Sign- and Goal-tracking
Rats were classified as sign-trackers (n = 14), goal-trackers (n
= 6), or intermediates (n = 4), based on their PCA scores in the

last two sessions of PCA training (sessions 19 and 20). Across
groups, the number of CS+ lever activations increased over the
course of training (Figure 1a; session, F(19,399) = 4.004, p <
0.001). The number of CS+ lever activations differed by phenotype (F(2,21) = 11.768, p < 0.001) and there was a significant
phenotype × session interaction (F(38,399) = 2.753, p < 0.001).
Sign-trackers made more CS+ lever activations than goal track-

Figure 3. SCH-23390 had greater effects on open field locomotor behavior than eticlopride. (a) Rats received vehicle, 0.01, or 0.1 mg/kg of SCH-23390 prior to a 45
min locomotor test (n = 8/dose). Total distance travelled was significantly reduced at the 0.1 but not 0.01 mg/kg dose. (b) The total number of moves was reduced
by SCH-23390 at both the 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg doses. (c) The amount of time spent in the center of the arena was significantly increased by 0.1 mg/kg SCH-23390,
reflecting rats’ near-immobility at this dose. (d) Eticlopride was tested using a similar design and reduced total distance travelled at the 0.1 but not 0.01 mg/kg
dose. (e) Similarly, eticlopride reduced the total number of moves at the 0.1 but not 0.01 mg/kg dose. (f) Eticlopride only significantly increased center time at the
0.1 mg/kg dose. Data are means ± SEM. * p < 0.05 for Bonferroni corrected post-hoc comparisons.

ers for sessions 5-20 (p ≤ 0.036). Rats with an intermediate
phenotype did not significantly differ from sign-trackers or
goal-trackers during any sessions.
In contrast, the number of CS- lever activations remained
low throughout training (Figure 1b; session, F(3.383,71.052) =
0.713, p = 0.563, ε= 0.178) for all phenotypes (phenotype × session interaction, F(6.767,71.052) = 0.501, p = 0.826). Although
there was a main effect of phenotype (F(2,21) = 3.589, p =
0.046), post-hoc comparisons between sign-trackers and goaltrackers or intermediates were not significant (p ≥ 0.054).
Goal-trackers acquired a port entry response during the CS+.
Since there were very few Pre-CS+ port entries throughout
training (generally < 5 port entries/session), normalized CS+
port entries are shown in Figure 1c (CS+ port entries minus PreCS+ port entries). The number of NormCS+ port entries significantly increased across training sessions (F(4.776,100.304) =
8.273, p < 0.001, ε= 0.251) and this significantly differed based
on phenotype (F(2,21) = 33.346, p < 0.001; phenotype × session F(9.553,100.304) = 4.528, p < 0.001). Post-hoc comparisons showed goal-trackers made more NormCS+ port entries
than sign-trackers in sessions 7-20 (p ≤ 0.009). Intermediates made more NormCS+ port entries than sign-trackers on
sessions 10-11, 13-14, 16 and 20 (p ≤ 0.03) and fewer NormCS+
port entries than goal-trackers on sessions 10-20 (p ≤ 0.044).
Normalized port entries (mean Pre-CS- port entries were
generally < 5/session) during CS- trials increased over the
course of training (Figure 1d; session, F(8.864,186.138) = 5.034,
p < 0.001, ε= 0.467). This was due to the negative NormCSscores in sessions 1 and 2 because there were no significant differences between sessions 3-20. NormCS- port entries were

affected by phenotype (F(2,21) = 5.056, p = 0.016), as goaltrackers overall made more NormCS- port entries than signtrackers (p = 0.015). However, there was no significant phenotype × session interaction (F(17.727,186.138) = 1.292, p = 0.121).
SCH-23390.
The number of CS+ lever activations (Figure 2a) differed by
phenotype (F(2,21) = 5.09, p = 0.016). CS+ lever activations
were significantly reduced by SCH-23390, as a function of dose
and phenotype (dose, F(1.347,28.294) = 20.441, p < 0.001, ε=
0.674; dose × phenotype interaction, F(2.695,28.294) = 3.154,
p = 0.045). In sign-trackers, SCH-34490 significantly reduced
CS+ lever activations at the 0.01 mg/kg dose, versus vehicle (p
< 0.001), and the high 0.1 mg/kg dose, relative to vehicle and
0.01 mg/kg SCH-23390 (p ≤ 0.001). In intermediates, SCH23390 decreased CS+ lever activations at the 0.1 mg/kg dose (p
= 0.047), but not 0.01 mg/kg (p = 0.126), relative to vehicle.
Normalized CS+ port entries (Figure 2b) varied according
to SCH-23390 dose and phenotype (dose, F(1.271,26.687) =
9.961, p = 0.002, ε= 0.635; phenotype, F(2,21) = 5.904, p =
0.009) and there was a significant dose × phenotype interaction (F(2.542,26.687) = 3.802, p = 0.027). In goal-trackers,
SCH-23390 decreased CS+ port entries at the 0.01 mg/kg dose,
compared to vehicle (p = 0.041), and the 0.1 mg/kg dose compared to vehicle (p = 0.002) and 0.01 mg/kg (p = 0.006). Signtrackers and intermediates were not significantly affected.
SCH-23390 dose-dependently reduced ITI port entries (Figure 2c). There was a main effect of dose (F(1.233,25.899)
= 28.072, p < 0.001, ε= 0.617), but no effect of phenotype
(F(2,21) = 1.244, p = 0.309) or dose × phenotype interaction

Figure 4. Amphetamine exposure during sensitization induction increased locomotor behavior. (a) Total distance travelled in 30 min was not significantly
different between vehicle and amphetamine rats (n = 12/group) during a habituation session when all rats received saline. However, when amphetamine rats
began receiving daily 2 mg/kg amphetamine injections, they significantly increased their total distance travelled. (b) Similarly, the number of movement episodes
was not different during habituation but was significantly reduced during amphetamine exposure. (c) The amount of center time was also not different between
vehicle and amphetamine rats during habituation but was increased during amphetamine exposure. (d) Rats were immediately transferred to behavioral chambers
after their locomotor session for 20 min. During habituation, there was no difference in the number of port entries made, but amphetamine rats made significantly
more port entries during amphetamine exposure. Data are means ± SEM.

Eticlopride.

ITI port entries (Figure 2f) were reduced by high dose eticlopride. There was no effect of phenotype (F(2,21) = 0.26,
p = 0.774) or dose × phenotype interaction (F(2.591,28.256)
= 0.216, p = 0.866). However, there was an effect of dose
(F(1.346,28.256) = 8.6, p = 0.003, ε= 0.673). While 0.01 mg/kg
did not differ from vehicle (p = 0.608), 0.1 mg/kg eticlopride
reduced ITI port entries compared to vehicle (p = 0.014) and
0.01 mg/kg (p = 0.023).

and phenotype (dose, F(2,42) = 9.982, p < 0.001; phenotype,
F(2,21) = 4.061, p = 0.032) and there was a significant dose ×
phenotype interaction (F(4,42) = 2.779, p = 0.039). In signtrackers, eticlopride reduced CS+ lever activations (0.1 mg/kg
vs vehicle, p < 0.001; 0.01 mg/kg vs vehicle p = 0.001), but had
no significant effect on goal-trackers or intermediates.
NormCS+ port entries (Figure 2e) was affected by dose
and phenotype (dose, F(2,42) = 13.676, p < 0.001; phenotype,
F(2,21) = 12.799, p < 0.001) and there was a significant dose ×

Rats received vehicle or 2 mg/kg amphetamine before exposure
to the locomotor (Figure 4a-c) and behavioral chambers (Figure 4d; n = 12/group). During the habituation session, there
were no significant differences in distance travelled (Figure 4a;
t(22) = -1.238, p = 0.229), number of moves (Figure 4b; t(22)
= -0.565, p = 0.578), center time (Figure 4c; t(22) = -0.365,
p = 0.719), or port entries (Figure 4d; equal variances not assumed; t(19.888) = -0.646, p = 0.526). Amphetamine treatment increased the total distance travelled (F(1,22) = 89.115, p
< 0.001), but there was no effect of session (F(3.51,77.214) =
0.438, p = 0.757, ε= 0.585) or session × treatment interaction
(F(3.51,77.214) = 0.635, p = 0.619).
Amphetamine treatment decreased the number of movement episodes (F(1,22) = 9.763, p = 0.005), but there was no
effect of session (F(3.083,67.816) = 2.035, p = 0.115, ε= 0.514),
or session × treatment interaction (F(3.083,67.816) = 0.584, p =
0.632). Amphetamine treatment increased the amount of center time (F(1,22) = 24.693, p < 0.001). There was an effect of
session (F(3.615,79.527) = 3.582, p = 0.012, ε= 0.602), but no
differences between specific sessions or session × treatment
interaction (F(3.615,79.527) = 0.655, p = 0.61). Amphetamine
treatment elevated the number of port entries during the 20
min session (F(1,22) = 11.878, p = 0.002), but there was no effect of session (F(3.442,75.716) = 1.801, p = 0.147, ε= 0.574) or

Phenotypic shift.
Based on PCA scores from session 15 and 16, vehicle rats
were mostly sign-trackers (n = 10) with 2 goal-trackers. Amphetamine rats were also sign-trackers (n = 9) with 1 goaltracker and 2 intermediates. While there was an effect of session on CS+ lever activations (Figure 5a; F(3.202,70.437) =
11.309, p < 0.001, ε= 0.213), there was no effect of treatment
(F(1,22) = 0.226, p = 0.639) or session × treatment interaction
(F(3.202,70.437) = 1.024, p = 0.391). For NormCS+ port entries
(Figure 5b), there was no effect of treatment (F(1,22) = 1.593,

sessions (F(3.028,66.624) = 8.259, p < 0.001, ε= 0.202), there

Figure 6. Amphetamine-exposed rats showed evidence of locomotor sensitization. Both vehicle and amphetamine-exposed rats (n = 12/group) received a 0.75
mg/kg amphetamine challenge. (a) Although total distance did not significantly differ between groups during the 30 min test, (b) amphetamine-exposed rats had
fewer movement episodes than vehicle rats, suggesting more movement per episode, and (c) spent more time in the center of the arena than vehicle rats. Data
are means ± SEM. * p < 0.05 for an independent t-test.

Thus, amphetamine exposure had no effect on phenotype over
the course of training.
Sensitization test.
After receiving an acute 0.75 mg/kg amphetamine challenge,
total distance travelled (Figure 6a) did not differ between vehicle and amphetamine-treated rats (t(22) = -1.121, p = 0.274).
Amphetamine-treated rats had fewer episodes of movement
(Figure 6b; t(22) = 2.783, p = 0.011), and increased center time
(Figure 6c; t(22) = -2.179, p = 0.04), demonstrating locomotor
sensitization to amphetamine.

Discussion
We have shown that D1 and D2 antagonists have differential effects after extended PCA training, although locomotor sensitization did not alter the phenotypic shift towards sign-tracking.
D1 antagonism using SCH-23390 reduced sign-tracking and
goal-tracking, but this was confounded by motor suppressive effects during the ITI and on open field locomotor behavior. The D2 antagonist, eticlopride, selectively reduced
goal-tracking in goal-trackers without affecting sign-trackers
or intermediates at a dose that did not have significant motor suppressive locomotor effects. These results suggest that
dopamine, particularly at D2 receptors, is important for goaltracking but that these receptors are not required for the expression of a sign-tracking response after extended training.
D1 antagonism using SCH-23390 disrupted both signtracking and goal-tracking, however, its effects were confounded by motor suppressive effects. We chose the 0.01 mg/kg
dose of SCH-23390 because previous data from our lab showed
that it was an effective dose that impaired Pavlovian conditioned responding for an alcohol cue without affecting ITI port
entries (Sciascia et al., 2014). Other laboratories have shown
this dose disrupted acquisition of sign-tracking (Chow et al.,
2016) and expression of sign-tracking (Clark et al., 2013). Although our previous studies did not find effects on ITI port entries (Sciascia et al., 2014) and other laboratories have reported
no non-specific effects on food consumption during conditioning (Chow et al., 2016), we found that 0.01 mg/kg SCH-23390
impaired ITI port entries and the number of moves made in an
open field locomotor test. While SCH-23390 appeared to reduce sign-tracking in sign-trackers and goal-tracking in goal-

trackers, it is difficult to interpret these effects in the presence
of these off-target effects.
We found that D2 antagonism using eticlopride was effective at reducing goal-tracking in goal-trackers, but not signtracking in sign-trackers at a dose that did not have motor suppressive effects on ITI responses or locomotor behavior. Some
studies have found D2 antagonists reduced both sign-tracking
and goal-tracking (Fraser et al., 2016; Lopez et al., 2015), which
would appear inconsistent with the present findings. However,
when administered intermittently prior to training, eticlopride
reduced both sign-tracking and goal-tracking responses during training, but left sign-tracking, goal-tracking, and the
conditioned reinforcing effects of the CS lever largely intact
during a drug-free test (Chow et al., 2016). Chow et al. (2016)
suggest that this may be because eticlopride is important for
the performance of these behaviors, but not for learning the
CS-US association. Consistent with this interpretation and the
selective impairment of goal-tracking observed by Roughley
and Killcross (2019), the present data shows that D2 antagonism during test disrupts goal-tracking, which is more reliant
on the CS-US association, but leaves sign-tracking intact.
We observed a shift to sign-tracking with extended training, replicating previous findings from our laboratory. Previous studies have shown that some rats will shift from goaltracking to sign-tracking for an alcohol cue after 16 or more
training sessions (Srey et al., 2015; Villaruel and Chaudhri,
2016). In the present study, which used a sucrose reinforcer,
rats appear to be acquiring a goal-tracking response in sessions 1-4 before PCA scores increase and asymptote around
session 10-13. This result suggests a robust shift towards signtracking (in our hands) across reinforcers.
Prior amphetamine exposure did not have an effect on the
shift towards sign-tracking, despite several previous studies
implicating dopamine signalling in the acquisition of signtracking. Sign-trackers show greater expression of D1 receptors after the first training session and dopamine signalling
remains important for the maintenance of sign-tracking responses (Flagel et al., 2007; Fraser et al., 2016). Moreover,
a higher phasic dopamine response was associated with signtracking across multiple sessions (Flagel et al., 2011). Previous studies found sensitization augmented CS lever activations (Wyvell and Berridge, 2001), and augmentation may
be achieved with a single amphetamine injection (Schuweiler
et al., 2018; Wyvell and Berridge, 2000). However, other

studies have shown locomotor sensitization enhanced goaltracking (Simon et al., 2008). One consideration is these studies used very different protocols, such as inducing sensitization after conditioning (Wyvell and Berridge, 2001) or using
food-restricted rats (Simon et al., 2008). However, it has also
been shown that the dopamine response to an appetitive CS
diminishes with extended training (Clark et al., 2013), suggesting that although dopamine is important for the maintenance of the sign-tracking response (Fraser et al., 2016), additional dopamine signalling may not be required to express a
sign-tracking response. Our data suggests that although previous studies have shown the necessity of dopamine for expressing a sign-tracking response, that additional sensitivity
to dopamine is not sufficient to enhance the acquisition of signtracking.
Our amphetamine exposure regimen produced locomotor
sensitization, even if sign-tracking was not affected. We exposed rats to the locomotor chambers and behavioral chambers during amphetamine exposure because sensitization may
be context-sensitive (Badiani et al., 1995a,b; Crombag et al.,
2001, 2000). Our sensitization test followed previous studies, administering a 0.75 mg/kg amphetamine challenge to
all rats (Robinson et al., 2015). Rats previously exposed to
amphetamine had fewer movement episodes, suggesting increased movement per episode, and increased center time.
While there was no difference in total distance travelled during the sensitization test, total distance travelled during test
was similar to the exposure phase. Previous studies have found
that differences in locomotor activity emerge later in the sensitization test (Simon et al., 2008), so an effect on total distance
travelled may have emerged if our sensitization test was longer.
The effect of amphetamine on two of three locomotor activity
measures during the sensitization test therefore suggests amphetamine induced locomotor sensitization, but this did not
alter the acquisition of sign-tracking behavior.

Conclusion
We found that a commonly used dose of SCH-23390 may have
motor suppressive effects at a commonly used dose, necessitating caution in interpreting these results and further studies using D1 antagonists that avoid these confounds. We also found
that the D2 antagonism selectively reduced goal-tracking in
goal-trackers after extended training, a finding that is consistent with some previous findings (Chow et al., 2016; Roughley and Killcross, 2019) and the view that D2 receptors are required for expressing behaviors related to the CS-US association. While we successfully induced locomotor sensitization,
this did not facilitate the acquisition of sign-tracking. Further
studies are required to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the acquisition of sign-tracking following
extended Pavlovian conditioned approach training.
