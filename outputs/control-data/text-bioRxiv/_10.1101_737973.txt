Abstract Muscle biomechanics is determined by active motor-protein assembly and passive
strain transmission through cytoskeletal structures. The extrasarcomeric desmin Ô¨Ålament network
aligns myoÔ¨Åbrils at the z-discs, provides nuclear-sarcolemmal anchorage and may also serve as
memory for muscle repositioning following large strains. Our previous analyses of R349P desmin
knock-in mice, an animal model for the human R350P desminopathy, already depicted pre-clinical
changes in myoÔ¨Åbrillar arrangement and increased Ô¨Åber bundle stiffness compatible with a
pre-aged phenotype in the disease. Since the speciÔ¨Åc effect of R349P desmin on axial
biomechanics in fully differentiated muscle Ô¨Åbers is unknown, we used our automated MyoRobot
biomechatronics platform to compare passive and active biomechanics in single Ô¨Åbers derived
from fast- and slow-twitch muscles from adult to senile mice hetero- or homozygous for this
desmin mutation with wild-type littermates. Experimental protocols involved caffeine-induced

Ca2+ -mediated force transients, pCa-force curves, resting length-tension curves, visco-elasticity and
‚Äôslack-tests‚Äô. We demonstrate that the presence of R349P desmin predominantly increased single
Ô¨Åber axial stiffness in both muscle types with a pre-aged phenotype over wild-type Ô¨Åbers. Axial
viscosity was unaffected. Likewise, no systematic changes in Ca2+ -mediated force properties were
found. Notably, mutant single Ô¨Åbers showed faster unloaded shortening over wild-type Ô¨Åbers.
Effects of ageing seen in the wild-type always appeared earlier in the mutant desmin Ô¨Åbers.
Impaired R349P desmin muscle biomechanics is clearly an effect of a compromised intermediate
Ô¨Ålament network rather than secondary to Ô¨Åbrosis.

Introduction
Skeletal muscle is the largest organ system of the body and under constant mechanical stress, either
due to passive strain or through active contraction producing axial and lateral stresses. While lateral
forces are distributed between single Ô¨Åbers across anchorage points in the extracellular matrix
(ECM) to the intracellular cytoskeleton via the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) Ramaswamy
et al. (2011) and focal adhesion complexes Ra et al. (1999), axial forces are distributed through
contractile (active) and non-contractile (passive) elements. Apart from the giant, roughly 1.5 ùúám
long elastomeric protein titin, being responsible for the visco-elastic properties of single muscle
Ô¨Åbers through unfolding of globular domains under strain M√°rtonfalvi and Kellermayer (2014);
Powers et al. (2018), connecting proteins of the extra-sarcomeric intermediate Ô¨Ålament (IF) family
may also be a vital determinant of axial elasticity. An important member of the IFs is the type
III Ô¨Ålament protein desmin, transversely linking adjacent myoÔ¨Åbrils at the level of the z-disc and
thus, being responsible for myoÔ¨Åbrillar register Waterman-Storer (1991); Anderson et al. (2001);
Meyer et al. (2010). In humans, desmin is encoded on chromosome 2q35 by a single copy gene.
The 53 kDa desmin presents a tripartite structure with a central-helical coiled-coil domain Ô¨Çanked
by non-helical tail and head domains. Due to its intrinsic self-assembling properties, it builds
three-dimensional networks, starting with supercoil formation via dimerization of two desmin
molecules. Two such dimers then associate into tetramers that represent the repetitive add-on
units for spontaneous assembly of 60 nm long Ô¨Ålaments, the so-called unit-length Ô¨Ålaments (ULFs,
Clemen et al. (2013)). Serial longitudinal annealing of ULFs consequently builds short Ô¨Ålaments,
extending the IF network. In the end, long Ô¨Ålaments reduce their diameter by spontaneous radial
compaction to form the mature IF network. The network connects to multiple intracellular adhesion
sites by cross-bridging proteins from the spectrin superfamily, i.e. plectin and nesprins Liem (2016).
In skeletal muscle, IFs form a huge stress-transmitting and stress-signalling network, and desmin
in particular, is required for the maintenance of myoÔ¨Åbrillar alignment, nuclear positioning and
shape, stress production and sensing Palmisano et al. (2015); Meyer et al. (2010). Due to the low
turn-over rates of IF proteins, the IF network remains largely intact even when exposed to large
physical strains, e.g. surviving at least 350% strains before rupture Block et al. (2017); Kreplak
et al. (2008). This led to their proposed role of acting as a cytoskeletal ‚Äôposition-memory‚Äô to ensure
the proper re-assembly of cytoskeletal components following recovery from large strains Gan
et al. (2016). The deleterious effects of abnormal desmin IF networks, due to either the additional
presence of mutant or the complete lack of wild-type desmin protein, are emphasized by the
group of human desminopathies that comprise autosomal-dominantly and recessively inherited
myopathies and cardiomyopathies Clemen et al. (2013). Human desminopathies are clinically
characterized by a broad phenotypic variability ranging from primary distal myopathies, limb girdle
muscular dystrophies and scapuloperoneal syndromes to generalized myopathies Walter et al.
(2007); Baer (2005); Clemen et al. (2009); Durmu≈ü et al. (2016). The major problem with elucidating
pathophysiological mechanisms of the human phenotypes is that knowledge about early and
intermediate stages of the disease is usually elusive, since muscle tissue specimens for research
are not available from patients at pre-clinical stages. Therefore, a patient-mimicking knock-in

mouse strain carrying the R349P desmin mutation, the murine orthologous of the human R350P
mutation, was generated Clemen et al. (2015). This model already allowed detailed systematic
studies of clinical and myopathological phenotypes as well as age-dependent effects on the disease
progression in heterozygous (het) and homozygous (hom) desminopathy mice over their wild-type
(wt) littermates Diermeier et al. (2017a). In particular, our previous work demonstrated that the
expression of R349P mutated desmin compromised the three-dimensional arrangement and the
order of the myoÔ¨Åbrillar lattice already starting in young mice before presenting muscle. The
latter Ô¨Åndings were interpreted as a pre-aged phenotype of muscle structural ageing in the R349P
environment Diermeier et al. (2017b). Moreover, biomechanical analyses of small Ô¨Åber bundles,
initially in slow-twitch, load-bearing M. soleus (SOL) from young het and hom R349P desmin mice,
showed a marked increase in passive bundle stiffness compared to wt bundles Clemen et al. (2015);
Diermeier et al. (2017a). Since robust biomechanical experiments in small muscle Ô¨Åber bundle
preparations are diÔ¨Écult to carry out and require precise actuation to record steady-state resting
length tension curves at slow strain speeds, we engineered a novel automated biomechatronics
system that also contains a sensitive force transducer technology for recordings of active and
passive axial muscle forces Haug et al. (2018). Alongside with the ongoing engineering progress,
our system was also systematically validated extending our previous recordings in SOL bundles from
R349P desmin mice not only to the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, but also to a
wide age range from young (17 - 23 weeks) to aged (60 - 80 weeks) animals Haug et al. (2019). Again,
our Ô¨Åndings in young animals of increased tissue stiffness were conÔ¨Årmed in both muscle entities
with a pre-aged phenotype in the desminopathy model. However, since also ECM re-modeling has
been shown with increased levels of tissue Ô¨Åbrosis with age in the R349P background Diermeier
et al. (2017a), an unambiguous explanation towards the link of increased axial stiffness to the
disrupted desmin network could not be drawn. This is because in small Ô¨Åber bundles, both the
ECM and the intracellular cytoskeleton still contribute to the overall axial compliance. To tackle this
constraint, the present study was designed to revisit biomechanical tests in EDL and SOL R349P
desminopathy muscles using pure mechanically dissected single Ô¨Åber segments with a reÔ¨Åned
version of our MyoRobot suitable to record single Ô¨Åber forces. Our results provide novel insights
into (i) the connection of mutated desmin to axial active / passive biomechanics in single Ô¨Åbers and
(ii) the age-dependent progression of altered Ô¨Åber mechanics in this desminopathy model.

Ca2+ -mediated active isometric force and contractile apparatus Ca2+ -sensitivity automatically assessed in single Ô¨Åbers from R349P desminopathy SOL and EDL muscles during ageing
Fig. 1A shows representative MyoRobot-executed force transient recordings of a caffeine-triggered
Ca2+ -mediated force response to empty the SR of its releasable Ca2+ , followed by a maximum
Ca2+ -saturated activation of the contractile apparatus in HA solution. Finally, exposure to EGTA-rich
HR solution buffered any remaining excess Ca2+ ions. Consistent with the characteristics of fastvs. slow-twitch muscle, EDL and SOL Ô¨Åbers showed faster or slower transient kinetics, respectively.
Caffeine-induced peak force (Fig. 1B), maximum Ca2+ -saturated force amplitudes (Fig. 1C) and
their ratio (Fig. 1D) were evaluated for all single Ô¨Åbers from all genotypes over all ages in both
muscles. In EDL, caffeine-induced force developed differentially with age in the three genotypes. In
wt single Ô¨Åbers, force amplitudes initially increased with age to signiÔ¨Åcantly drop again in senile
animals. In contrast, in the R349P desmin knock-in background, force developed oppositely in het
Ô¨Åbers (decrease in the aged group and recovery to adult levels in the senile group) or did not vary
signiÔ¨Åcantly within the hom group. Within age groups, we discovered isolated, genotype-speciÔ¨Åc
signiÔ¨Åcant differences that were however, not systematic (Fig. 1B). Unlike caffeine-induced force,
maximum Ca2+ -saturated force was unchanged in EDL single Ô¨Åbers, regardless of age or genotype
(Fig. 1C). The ratio of caffeine-induced to maximum force amplitudes serves as an indicator of SR

Ca2+ Ô¨Ålling and thus, showed a similar behaviour as the former (Fig. 1D). While maximum force
amplitudes in SOL single Ô¨Åbers were generally similar to those in EDL Ô¨Åbers (Fig. 1C), caffeineinduced force levels were roughly two-times smaller (Fig. 1B). Within SOL Ô¨Åbers, no difference
among genotypes was seen while age had a strong negative effect on force amplitudes, which were
signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced in wt preparations for all progressing ages, and in het / hom Ô¨Åbers between
the adult and the senile age group. Maximum attainable force levels were also impeded by age and
displayed a signiÔ¨Åcant decline during ageing within each genotype. Particularly hom Ô¨Åbers were
already signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced in the adult age cohort, while the still better performing wt and het
Ô¨Åbers gradually declined to the level of hom Ô¨Åbers with age. This suggests a pre-aged phenotype in
hom Ô¨Åbers regarding maximum contractile forces. The combined differences regarding force ratios
were restricted to a signiÔ¨Åcant age-related, genotype-speciÔ¨Åc decline (Fig. 1D).
To elaborate on the Ca2+ -sensitivity of the contractile apparatus in single Ô¨Åbers carrying the
desmin R349P mutation, pCa-force recordings were performed in single Ô¨Åbers across the three
age groups in EDL and SOL muscles, as shown in representative single Ô¨Åber data traces from
each genotype in aged animals (Fig 2A). The top left panels show how force quickly rises to a new
steady-state level in response to increasing Ca2+ (decreasing pCa) steps. The right panels show the
respective average pCa-force of this age group for EDL (left) and SOL (right) muscle along with the
average reconstructed Hill Ô¨Åts (Fig. 2B). The curves in Fig. 2A already suggest a marked left-shift of
the sensor-curve in R349P desmin knock-in single Ô¨Åbers over wt, indicative of a myoÔ¨Åbrillar Ca2+
sensitization in presence of mutant desmin. This was also conÔ¨Årmed in the group analysis, where
adult hom R349P desmin knock-in EDL single Ô¨Åbers were initially less Ca2+ sensitive but became
more sensitive than the wt in aged animals. Since in senile mice, an age-related Ca2+ -sensitization
was also observed in wt animals, the behaviour of hom Ô¨Åbers can be considered as a pre-aged
phenotype towards higher Ca2+ -sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. This also agrees with wt
single EDL Ô¨Åbers reaching their largest pCa50 value one age bin later than hom Ô¨Åbers. Within the
oldest age cohort (senile), all pCa50 values had Ô¨Ånally reached similar levels among genotypes.
Unlike EDL, SOL only displayed age-related effects in the wt, with an initial Ca2+ -desensitization
(from the adult to aged animals) that was later revoked in senile animals. Similar to the EDL, adult
hom SOL Ô¨Åbers showed yet signiÔ¨Åcantly depressed pCa50 values, which however, strongly increased
in the aged age cohort while wt Ô¨Åbers only matched those high levels in the senile age group (Fig.
2B). Het Ô¨Åbers showed similar trends as hom Ô¨Åbers, yet, did not reach statistical signiÔ¨Åcance. The
Hill coeÔ¨Écients in EDL single Ô¨Åbers showed no signiÔ¨Åcant differences regarding genotypes while
age had a signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence on het Ô¨Åbers between aged and senile animals. In SOL single Ô¨Åbers,
differences were present among genotypes, with lower coeÔ¨Écients values for Ô¨Åbers expressing the
R349P mutation (except het adult), while age had a signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence on wt Ô¨Åbers, leading to
a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in Hill coeÔ¨Écients in aged and senile Ô¨Åbers over adult Ô¨Åbers, indicative of a
higher dynamic range of the myoÔ¨Åbrillar Ca2+ -biosensor complex.

Steady-state resting length-tension curves demonstrate a markedly decreased axial compliance and a pre-aged passive stiffness increase in R349P desmin knock-in
single Ô¨Åbers
Our previous work in small Ô¨Åber bundles from SOL muscles demonstrated an increased axial
stiffness in R349P desmin knock-in mice Diermeier et al. (2017a); Haug et al. (2019). However,
since we also documented increased Ô¨Åbrosis in these muscles Diermeier et al. (2017a), it cannot
be ruled out to which extent the observed Ô¨Åbrosis would impact on the increased axial stiffness. To
eliminate the inÔ¨Çuence of ECM components on biomechanics recordings, a preparation of single
Ô¨Åbers represented the best possible experimental solution. Fig. 3A shows a series of example RLT
curves of single Ô¨Åbers of each genotype and age group from EDL and SOL muscles. The example
traces already suggest that the RLT slope strongly increased with age in single Ô¨Åbers with mutation
background, the more so in EDL over SOL muscle. This increase occurred in wt EDL single Ô¨Åbers
in a less-pronounced fashion, while it was absent in wt SOL samples, which remained at similar

steady-state maximum force (HA) (C) and respective RS:HA force ratios (D) indicate an overall decrease in SR
Ca2+ -release force during ageing in EDL and SOL, regardless of genotype. Within age groups, RS peak force was
signiÔ¨Åcantly larger in hom EDL Ô¨Åbers for the adult and senile groups, while they were similar in SOL. In EDL,
there was no difference in maximum attainable force among genotypes regardless of age. Thus, RS:HA force
ratios in EDL reÔ¨Çect the pattern-differences of RS peaks, while in SOL Ô¨Åbres, relative force during SR Ca2+
release over maximum Ca2+ -saturated force were similar among genotypes and showed a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease
with ageing. SigniÔ¨Åcance tested with two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc analysis (Bonferroni). Numbers in

adult, aged and senile R349P desmin mice. A, representative force recordings in an aged single EDL (left)

mean pCa-force curves alongside with the mean reconstructed Hill Ô¨Åt to the data are shown to the right. The

Hill coeÔ¨Écients in (B) show a signiÔ¨Åcantly increased Ca2+ -sensitivity in aged R349P desmin knock-in animals
over the wt which is caught up in the senile group. Likewise, in the adult age group, Ca2+ -sensitivity is similar
between genotypes. In EDL, there was a signiÔ¨Åcant trend towards increasing Ca2+ -sensitivity in the R349P
desmin knock-in background with age, while in SOL, signiÔ¨Åcant age-related changes were only observed in the
wt. Overall, differences between wt and hom preparations became more distinct with age. Numbers in box

levels independent of age. This is in accordance with a pre-aged phenotype in the R349P mutants
regarding axial Ô¨Åber stiffness. As a measure for steady-state stiffness at the end of the stretch to the
140% L0 length, the maximum restoration force (FR) was analysed in Fig. 3B, statistically conÔ¨Årming
the behaviour seen in the examples. In the adult age group, max. FR values were all similar between
genotypes. In the EDL Ô¨Åbers, while they all increased with age, they did so more strongly and earlier
in the R349P knock-in background, signiÔ¨Åcantly exceeding the wt in the aged group. By the very old
senile age, the wt had then caught up with the mutants. Although not signiÔ¨Åcant, the het Ô¨Åbers
had smaller max. FR values than the hom Ô¨Åbers. This trend was also seen in the SOL Ô¨Åbers except
for the wt Ô¨Åbers showing signiÔ¨Åcantly decreased max. FR values with age in comparison to the
adult group. The higher max. FR values in the R349P knock-in background also impacted on a lower
survival of single Ô¨Åbers during stretch. Both, in EDL and SOL muscles, mutant single Ô¨Åbers already
broke at lower strains compared to the wt, while Ô¨Åbers het for R349P displayed a better survival
than hom Ô¨Åbers (Fig. 3C). Since these results indicate an increased axial stiffness or elasticity, the
10% strain-wise compliance was computed by linear Ô¨Åts to the RLT curve at the indicated strain
bins, as described in Haug et al. (2019), and plotted for all genotypes, ages and strains in Fig.3D.
The compliance plots conÔ¨Årm similar mechanical axial compliance for all genotypes in the adult age
group while compliance was signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced in mutant Ô¨Åbers of the aged age group. The wt
then declined to similar low compliances as the mutants in the senile age group for EDL muscle
Ô¨Åbers, whereas for SOL, compliance remained at high levels.

While the R349P mutation clearly affects axial elasticity, RLT curves did not provide insights into the
biomechanical axial viscosity. Therefore, we used the MyoRobot to perform ultra-fast stretch-jumps
such as shown in Fig. 4A for wt adult single Ô¨Åbers from EDL and SOL muscle. Each new stretch
jump was answered by an instantaneous restoration force (FùëÖ ) increase to a maximum, followed
by viscous relaxation (Fùëüùëíùëôùëéùë• ) to a new steady-state during the 5 s holding phase. ConÔ¨Årming the
Ô¨Åndings from the slow RLT curves, mutant single Ô¨Åbers had a much higher chance of rupture during
these strenuous sudden stretches as compared with wt Ô¨Åbers (Fig. 4B). The analysis of maximum
FùëÖ amplitudes with stretch bin, reÔ¨Çecting axial elasticity, conÔ¨Årmed the Ô¨Åndings from the RLT curves,
i.e. higher restoration forces in the mutant background (Fig. 4C). However, relaxation force Fùëüùëíùëôùëéùë• ,
representing the difference between maximum FùëÖ and steady-state FùëÖ within the same stretch
jump, was not signiÔ¨Åcantly different between either genotype or ages (Fig. 4D), arguing against any
involvement of the R349P mutant desmin in viscous relaxation.

Unloaded speed of shortening in R349P desmin single Ô¨Åbers is increased rather
than compromised
The observed increased passive elasticity in R349P mutant desmin single Ô¨Åbers suggests a negative
inÔ¨Çuence on muscle contraction kinetics, e.g. unloaded speed of shortening. To address this
question, we performed so-called ‚Äôslack-tests‚Äô using our automated MyoRobot system Haug et al.
(2018). Fig. 5A shows representative example recordings of a senile EDL (left) and an aged SOL
(right) single Ô¨Åber. After reaching steady-state maximum isometric contraction in HA solution, the
VCA quickly introduced a slack of deÔ¨Åned length dL. Consequently, force dropped to zero and
redeveloped over time (dt). The relation dL vs. dt is plotted to the right in Fig. 5A. Also shown
are the linearly derived fast and slow velocities vùëì ùëéùë†ùë° and vùë†ùëôùëúùë§ from the respective section of the
double exponential Ô¨Åt. Fig. 5B shows the dL-dt plots for all age groups and genotypes for both
muscles and Fig. 5C the statistical analysis of vùëì ùëéùë†ùë° and vùë†ùëôùëúùë§ . Vùëì ùëéùë†ùë° reÔ¨Çects the initial, unloaded phase,
whereas vùë†ùëôùëúùë§ represents the internally loaded phase that occurs while taking up larger ‚Äôslacks
lengths‚Äô Haug et al. (2018). Notably, vùëì ùëéùë†ùë° increased with age in all genotypes, while it decreased
again in senile mutation-bearing Ô¨Åbers, except for hom SOL Ô¨Åbers. In this context it was even
more compelling that mutant Ô¨Åbers performed signiÔ¨Åcantly faster than wt Ô¨Åbers in aged animals.
Although vùë†ùëôùëúùë§ qualitatively showed a similar trend, there were no statistical signiÔ¨Åcances regarding

Desminopathies comprise a heterogeneous group of inherited and sporadic myopathies which, in
the vast majority of cases, share a common morphological picture comprising sarcoplasmic and
subsarcolemmal desmin-positive protein aggregates and signs of myoÔ¨Åbrillar degeneration Jurcu≈¢
et al. (2017); Clemen et al. (2009); Walter et al. (2007). In general, analyses of the pathophysiology
of human desminopathies are hampered by the very limited amount of available human muscle
tissue specimens and the fact that the alterations noticed in diagnostic muscle biopsies nearly
always reÔ¨Çect late stages of the disease. In addition, these specimens are highly heterogeneous with
regard to sex, age, type of muscle and disease severity. To overcome these limitations, we generated
the patient-mimicking R349P desmin knock-in desminopathy mouse model, which harbours the
orthologous of the most frequent human desmin mutation R350P Clemen et al. (2015). The
availability of this mouse line has already served invaluable to perform age-related morphometric

analysis of cytoarchitectural changes in early disease stages in single Ô¨Åbers from slow- and fasttwitch muscles using multiphoton Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy Diermeier et al.
(2017a). In that study, we could show a pre-aged morphological phenotype depicting sarcomeric
lattice disorder and myoÔ¨Åbrillar angular distribution in both EDL and SOL single Ô¨Åbers Diermeier
et al. (2017a). On a single Ô¨Åber level, such distorted myoÔ¨Åbrillar cytoarchitecture would already be
a structural determinant of muscle weakness ‚Äòper se‚Äô since the resulting force vector of the parallel
myoÔ¨Åbrillar lattice in single Ô¨Åbers would be expected to be smaller compared to if all myoÔ¨Åbrils
were perfectly aligned Friedrich et al. (2010); Buttgereit et al. (2013); Schneidereit et al. (submitted
2018). For human R350P desminopathy, apart from clinical assessment of overall force in proximal
and distal muscle groups according to MRC grades Walter et al. (2007), no information on active
force production on the sub-organ level (single Ô¨Åbers, Ô¨Åber bundles) is available. For the murine
R349P desmin knock-in model, initial characterization of small SOL Ô¨Åber bundles at preclinical
stages in young mice Clemen et al. (2015) as well as very recently, a whole age-dependent study of
ours on small EDL and SOL Ô¨Åber bundles in mice from 17 wks to >60 wks of age, documented a
pre-aged phenotype regarding increased passive axial stiffness, using our novel high-end MyoRobot
biomechatronics system Haug et al. (2018). Together with the Ô¨Ånding of also increased extracellular
Ô¨Åbrosis in aged R349P desmin knock-in muscles Diermeier et al. (2017a), this still leaves the
possibility of series-elastic elements of increased stiffness in parallel to the cytoskeletal visco-elastic
elements to be responsible for the reduced axial compliance in small EDL and SOL Ô¨Åber bundles
seen before. In order to close this gap, we reÔ¨Åned our previous study to determine the active
and passive biomechanics properties in het and hom R349P desmin knock-in mice as well as
their wt littermates extending the age range from adult (35 - 45 wks) to very old (90 - 96 wks), as
well as to mechanically dissected single Ô¨Åbers, for the very Ô¨Årst time. The advantage of dissected
single Ô¨Åbers not containing ECM connections to surrounding elements any more, i.e. being void
of neighbouring Ô¨Åbers, provides a pure preparation to exclusively focus on the effect of mutated
desmin on cytoskeletal axial Ô¨Åber biomechanics.

Age is the more predominant determinant of compromised active axial biomechanics in single Ô¨Åbers from slow- and fast-twitch muscle compared to the presence of R349P mutant desmin protein
The most important Ô¨Ånding in our age-related study in single EDL and SOL Ô¨Åbers from adult to
senile mice was that age had a strong negative inÔ¨Çuence on active force production, with signiÔ¨Åcant
declines during ageing within each genotype regarding the caffeine-induced Ca2+ -mediated force
transients. This effect was more prominent in slow SOL Ô¨Åbers but also, to a lesser extent, in
fast-twitch EDL Ô¨Åbers. Among the genotypes, the presence of R349P mutated desmin was much
less of a systematic determinant of caffeine-induced active force, in particular in SOL Ô¨Åbers, while
in EDL Ô¨Åbers, some inconsistent signiÔ¨Åcances were present. Detailed systematic age-related studies
on contractile properties in fast- and slow-twitch muscle are rare with most studies having been
carried out on whole muscle. In 2 yr-old versus 6 mo-old rats, twitch and tetanic force were lower in
old over young animals, but accounting for an age-related atrophy of Ô¨Åbers, no differences were
found in the maximum force-generating capacity in either slow- or fast-twitch muscles at either
age Larsson and Edstr√∂m (1986). In the respective mouse muscles however, a decline in absolute
isometric tetanic force production to ‚àº75% of the values in young (2 - 3 mo) and adult (9 - 10 mo)
was reported in aged (26 - 27 mo) mice for both EDL and SOL muscle. This difference prevailed after
normalization to speciÔ¨Åc force for fast-twitch EDL, but for SOL speciÔ¨Åc tetanic force no more age
dependence was seen Brooks and Faulkner (1988). In a comparative study on maximum isometric
tension, comparing both Ô¨Åber bundles and single skinned Ô¨Åbers from rat SOL and EDL muscle
with age, maximum tension was increased by roughly 35% in senescent rats (30 mo) over control
adults (9 mo) for both SOL bundles and single Ô¨Åbers. The same only applied for single EDL Ô¨Åbers
whereas in EDL bundles, force almost dropped ‚àº20% with age Eddinger et al. (1986). Lastly, in
an age-related study in dystrophic mdx mice, single skinned SOL and EDL Ô¨Åbers displayed no

differences comparing young (3 - 6 wks) and adult (17 - 23 wks) animal Williams et al. (1993). The
recognition of considerable variability in speciÔ¨Åc isometric force values between study groups has
been stated to render comparisons between whole muscles, Ô¨Åber bundles and single Ô¨Åbers with
respect to ageing diÔ¨Écult Brooks and Faulkner (1988).
The important strength of our approach lies in the age-dependent assessment of R349P mutant
desmin effects in an age-dependent background which was not available before. One limitation
of our MyoRobot system at the time this study was initiated was still the lack of in-built optics
to measure the Ô¨Åber diameter for conversion of absolute force to speciÔ¨Åc, cross-sectional area
(CSA)-normalized force. Towards the completion of data collection for the age-related biomechanics
assessment here, ongoing optical engineering in our labs resulted in a more advanced version of
the MyoRobot that now contains in-built optics and a CCD camera to capture Ô¨Åber diameter online.
Although this system will be presented elsewhere, the absolute single Ô¨Åber force levels presented
here are well in the range of those reported by Stelzer & Widrick (2003) Stelzer and Widrick (2003)
in SOL Ô¨Åbers from adult (8 - 12 wks) mice, around 150 ùúáN per Ô¨Åber at maximum Ca2+ activation.
Inversely, when measured with our current setup, single mouse Ô¨Åbers from animals unrelated to
this study, Ô¨Åber diameter values of mostly between 30 ùúám and 40 ùúám were found which translates
speciÔ¨Åc forces to roughly 15 N/cm2 or 150 kPa, in perfect agreement with single Ô¨Åber speciÔ¨Åc force
values from literature Williams et al. (1993); Stelzer and Widrick (2003).
Regarding the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, a pre-aged phenotype in the R349P
background was observed. Particularly mutation-bearing EDL Ô¨Åbers displayed a myoÔ¨Åbrillar Ca2+ sensitization already within the aged age group, while in wt littermates, this became only apparent in
the senile group. This corroborates well with results from our very recent age-related biomechanical
assessment of R349P desmin small Ô¨Åber bundles, where a very similar desensitization of about
0.2 - 0.3 pCa units was seen from the adult to the aged age group in EDL bundles, both the het
and the hom Haug et al. (2019). For SOL, the single Ô¨Åber data here do not seem to show a Ô¨Årm
consistent trend among the genotypes with age, apart from a large scattering between individual
SOL Ô¨Åbers. This could be due to marked differences of pCa50 values between fast- and slow-twitch
Ô¨Åbers being present in the SOL muscle as it contains an almost equal proportions of either Ô¨Åber
type Edgerton et al. (1975); Lynch et al. (1993). Unlike in previous studies using single Ô¨Åber Ca2+
sensitivity assessment (e.g. Lynch et al. (1993) Lynch et al. (1993)), we did not attempt to type Ô¨Åbers
for myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms due to technical reasons and thus, this may at least partially
explain the observed scatter. However, from our previous work assessing the MHC composition
in SOL muscle homogenates in the three genotypes, we are conÔ¨Ådent that in particular the hom
Ô¨Åbers shall present with a higher slow-type MHC I proportion over wt and het Ô¨Åbers Diermeier
et al. (2017a). Therefore, the large scatter towards higher pCa50 values in aged and senile single
SOL Ô¨Åbers (Fig. 2B) is in good agreement with the fact of higher pCa50 values in type I over type II
Ô¨Åbers Lynch et al. (1993). Also, our absolute pCa50 values presented here are in good agreement
with the aforementioned study Lynch et al. (1993).

Passive axial biomechanics is shifted towards a pre-aged stiffer phenotype in single Ô¨Åbers by R349P desmin
Similar to our previous assessment in small Ô¨Åber bundles Clemen et al. (2015); Diermeier et al.
(2017a); Haug et al. (2019), single Ô¨Åbers showed a marked increase in passive restoration forces in
RLT experiments, which was at least three-times larger in aged animals with R349P background.
Restoration forces were signiÔ¨Åcantly increased and axial compliance accordingly decreased, already in single EDL Ô¨Åbers from aged R349P desmin knock-in animals compared to the equivalent
observations found in wt animals in the senile group, only. This clearly points to a pre-aged phenotype in fast-twitch muscle in the mutant desmin background. Notably, the increase in restoration
force (decrease in compliance) in EDL bundles already happened in young animals and was more
pronounced in hom R349P desmin knock-in mice, albeit not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant Haug et al.
(2019). Also, from the adult age, the differences were blunted among genotypes in bundles in

the EDL, arguing in favour of an important difference compared to single Ô¨Åbers. This can only be
explained by the abolishment of ECM components in the pure single Ô¨Åbers blunting the effects
of an additional parallel series elastic element contributing to the axial steady-state compliance.
In our SOL single Ô¨Åbers, a similar increase in passive axial stiffness in het and more pronounced
in hom R349P desmin knock-in single Ô¨Åbers was seen. This is also much more clear-cut here
compared to the presentation in SOL bundles. In the latter, the increase in stiffness with age was
mostly seen in hom bundles only, but those being highly statistically stiffer over het R349P and
wt bundles in aged mice Haug et al. (2019). The direct comparison of bundles Haug et al. (2019)
and single Ô¨Åbers now being available suggests that ECM components likely introduce an additional
compliance to the bundles, e.g. through elastic Ô¨Åbers, that would reduce the overall stiffness.
Alternatively, the over-proportionally larger cross-sectional area in bundles carrying the R349P
mutation may be dissipating restoration forces between both, intracellular (i.e. mutated desmin)
and extracellular non-contractile elements. Although an increase in ECM collagen was detected
in our previous study in R349P SOL bundles that was larger in hom over het bundles Diermeier
et al. (2017a), the involvement of other, more compliant ECM components to be increased in
the R349P desmin knock-in background cannot be ruled out and deserves further investigation.
Nevertheless, our MyoRobot approach was able to extend our previous knowledge on R349P axial
muscle stiffness to single Ô¨Åbers and also including a larger age range extending to the senile stage,
not only with regard to the R349P desmin knock-in background, but also in particular including
ageing effects in normal muscle. For instance, in both our EDL and SOL single Ô¨Åber preparations
from wt mice, axial compliance increased from the adult to the aged age groups to then remain
mostly stationary in the EDL, or they declined again in the SOL within the senile groups (Fig. 3D).
This is in good agreement with a comparative study on tibialis anterior mouse muscle single Ô¨Åbers
and small Ô¨Åber bundles, where single Ô¨Åbers from old mice showed a tendency for reduced elasticity
moduli (reÔ¨Çecting smaller stiffness, larger compliance values, respectively, kPa, n.s.) Wood et al.
(2014). More strikingly, the researchers showed that intrinsic stiffness of ECM increased with age as
indicated by larger Young moduli in Ô¨Åber bundles over single Ô¨Åbers, and in particular, a two-fold
increased bundle stiffness in old versus adult tibialis anterior Ô¨Åber bundles Wood et al. (2014). The
same behaviour of increased modulus (quadratic modulus, kP/ùúám2 ) values was shown in EDL Ô¨Åber
bundles over single Ô¨Åbers from young (7 - 9 wks) wt mice Meyer and Lieber (2011). When comparing
our axial single Ô¨Åber compliance values to the corresponding values in small Ô¨Åber bundles given
in our associated study in adult and aged mice (Haug et al. (2019a) Haug et al. (2019), i.e. for
SOL ‚àº1 ‚Äì 4 m/N and for EDL bundles ‚àº1 ‚Äì 6 m/N), one can see that our single Ô¨Åbers consistently
show higher compliance values, reÔ¨Çecting higher stiffness in bundles over single Ô¨Åbers. Meyer &
Lieber (2011) Meyer and Lieber (2011) also provide an elegant experimental explanation for the
increased stiffness in Ô¨Åber bundles over single Ô¨Åbers and grouped single Ô¨Åbers, in that the ECM
contribution to non-linear bundle elasticity is set out by spreading the sarcomere length distribution
of individual Ô¨Åbers within the bundle. This superposes different RLT-curves from single Ô¨Åbers in a
bundle to a non-linear resultant elasticity behaviour. This is most probably due to different lateral
and axial forces acting on adjacent single Ô¨Åbers through ECM-mediated focal adhesion connections,
i.e. integrins Gershlak and Black (2015). It is of note that the absolute values for axial stiffness
(compliance) in our study and those aforementioned ones cannot be directly compared, as different
methods were employed, and our system during that time of experiments in single Ô¨Åbers could
not yet assess single Ô¨Åber CSA and sarcomere lengths. When focusing on the inÔ¨Çuence of mutant
R349P on passive axial compliance / stiffness, our current results support those obtained in Ô¨Åber
bundles Haug et al. (2019) in showing signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced axial compliance indicative of stiffer
phenotype with the important difference that in the bundles, this effect seemed less systematic in
the respective age groups in both EDL and SOL muscles. In single Ô¨Åbers, compliance was clearly at
least two-fold reduced in the R349P background over wt animals, starting from the aged age group
in both muscles and staying diminished in SOL muscles while alleviating in the EDL muscle from
senile animals. Thus, revealing the higher stiffness in single Ô¨Åbers in a more robust way over the

respective Ô¨Åber bundle preparations Haug et al. (2019) again points to the crucial involvement of
ECM components which introduce additional non-linear elasticities to the axial compliance that
are diÔ¨Écult to predict in the R349P desmin knock-in background. The larger presence of Ô¨Åbrosis in
muscle tissue from aged mice hom for the R349P desmin allele clearly points towards the presence
of such non-linear elasticities over het and wt muscles Diermeier et al. (2017a). The larger stiffness
in pure single Ô¨Åbers in the R349P desmin knock-in background is also conÔ¨Årmed by their lower
resistance to stretch and thus, lower survival upon stretch, either quasi-static (Fig. 3C) or dynamic
(Fig. 4B). Similar to our Ô¨Åndings in bundles Haug et al. (2019), visco-elastic properties were not
signiÔ¨Åcantly altered in R349P desmin knock-in single Ô¨Åbers. It should be noted that apart from our
detailed study here, nothing is known about the inÔ¨Çuence of intermediate-Ô¨Ålament mutations on
the visco-elastic properties of fully differentiated muscle Ô¨Åbers.

Unloaded speed of shortening in ageing: faster contractions of R349P desmin knockin single Ô¨Åbers
With our recent implementation of a VCA within the MyoRobot Haug et al. (2018), it was now possible
to address whether the markedly increased axial stiffness in single Ô¨Åbers in the R349P desmin
knock-in background would impact on unloaded shortening, given the fact that the isometric
maximum force development was only marginally affected. The absolute values of velocities for
the fast component with mean values between 4 mm/s and 12 mm/s for EDL single Ô¨Åbers and
2 ‚Äì 6 mm/s for SOL Ô¨Åbers are well in the range of velocities reported for single EDL Ô¨Åbers from wt
mice unrelated to this study Haug et al. (2018). This demonstrates the robustness of our automated
biomechatronics system to assess active biomechanical properties in single Ô¨Åbers across studies
and organ scales. Similar to our previous study in small Ô¨Åber bundles, fast velocities increased
with age in het mice while in the wt, they remained stationary Haug et al. (2019). However, in
the aforementioned mentioned study of ours, only few numbers of observations were available
for EDL muscle bundles, which complicates a robust comparison. Rather, for SOL bundles with
higher numbers of observations, fast velocities showed a tendency for slowed shortening in the
R349P knock-in background in young animals that was mostly abrogated in the adult and aged
age group, except for a tendency of a faster shortening in the mutants Haug et al. (2019). Thus, it
was intriguing to Ô¨Ånd that both, fast and slow components of shortening in single muscle Ô¨Åbers
increased with age, the more so for the R349P knock-in background over the wt for adult and
aged mice for both EDL and SOL Ô¨Åbers, while values again merged to similar levels in senile mice.
Age-related values for unloaded shortening in single Ô¨Åbers are scarce in the literature. A study
on rat EDL single Ô¨Åbers found an unchanged maximum shortening velocity was in adult (9 mo)
versus senescent (30 mo) animals, whereas SOL Ô¨Åbers from old rats Eddinger et al. (1986) were
slower. In human vastus lateralis single skinned Ô¨Åbers, shortening velocities were reduced in type
IIA Ô¨Åbers but not type I Ô¨Åbers in older man, while the opposite was found for women Krivickas
et al. (2001). For murine muscles, a detailed sex and age-related study is not available, to our
knowledge. The reason for the increased speed of shortening in R349P desminopathy muscle
Ô¨Åbers cannot unambiguously be explained at current, in particular in view of our recent Ô¨Ånding that
slow-type MHC I isoforms were upregulated in R349P desmin knock-in muscles while fast-twitch
MHC II isoforms were downregulated Diermeier et al. (2017a). Thus, the R349P mutated desmin
must have some inÔ¨Çuence on the kinetics of weak cross-bridge attachment that has been found to
predominantly determine unloaded speed of shortening Stehle, R. & Brenner, B. (2000). Whether
this may be an explanation for the increased shortening velocity in desminopathy single Ô¨Åbers
deserves future investigation.

Summary and outlook
Our results prove the increased passive steady-state elasticity found in R349P desminopathy skeletal
muscle to be an inherent factor related to the mutant desmin inÔ¨Çicted damage of the cytoskeleton
and not the ECM. This results in a pre-aged, stiffer phenotype of affected muscle Ô¨Åbers. Apart

from a yet unexplained acceleration of speed of shortening in Ô¨Åbers expressing R349P desmin,
Ca2+ -mediated active force was only mildly affected, if at all. Our MyoRobot system allows a highly
versatile and modular design of automated execution of various additional muscle test protocols,
e.g. eccentric contractions, that shall be of use to the community to ease future myopathy and
mechanistic studies related to skeletal muscle and ageing.

All muscle dissection was performed in Krebs-solution containing (mM): 120 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2
KH2 PO4 , 1.2 MgSO4 x7H2 O, 24.8 NaHCO3 , 0.1 M glucose, 0.1% FCS (FBS), pH 7.3. A Ca2+ -free, high K+ solution (HKS) was used to permanently depolarize the muscle cell membrane to abolish excitability
during manual tethering of fascicles and isolation of single Ô¨Åber segments. HKS (‚Äôhigh-K+ -solution‚Äô)
contained 140 K-glutamate, 10 Hepes, 10 glucose, 10 MgCl2 , 1 EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(ùõΩ-aminoethyl
ether)-N,N,N‚Äô,N‚Äô-tetraacetic acid, pH 7.0. To maximally Ca2+ -activate single Ô¨Åbers, a Ca2+ -saturated
high activating internal solution (HA) was used containing: 30 Hepes, 6.05 Mg(OH)2 , 30 EGTA, 29
CaCO3 , 8 Na2 ATP, 10 Na2 CP, pH 7.2. Free Ca2+ of HA was calculated to ‚àº12.5 ùúáM using the chelatorligand binding software React (developed by Geoffrey Lee, University of Glasgow). To maximally
relax single Ô¨Åbers and to completely buffer Ca2+ ions each time a Ô¨Åber was exposed to Ca2+ , high
relaxing solution (HR) was used that had the same composition as HA except for not containing
any Ca2+ (for practical reasons of pCa calculations, a pCa of 9 is assumed in HR). Mixtures of HA
and HR were calculated to obtain a given pCa of the internal solution for graded Ca2+ -activation in
pCa-force response curves using React and consisted of HA:HR ratios of 0.3:0.7, 0.5:0.5, 0.55:0.45,
0.6:0.4, 0.65:0.35, 0.7:0.3, 0.8:0.2, 0.9:0.1, 0.95:0.05, 0.98:0.02, 1:0, converting to pCa values of
6.74, 6.38, 6.30, 6.21, 6.12, 6.03, 5.82, 5.54, 5.32, 5.11, 4.92, respectively. Low relaxing solution (LR)
served as an intermediate step after HR or loading solution (LS, see below) to replace the high
aÔ¨Énity Ca2+ chelator EGTA for low aÔ¨Énity HDTA (1,6-diaminohexane-N,N,N‚Äô,N‚Äô-tetraacetic acid). LR
contained: 30 Hepes, 7.86 Mg(OH)2 , 87.8 K-glutamate, 6.6 HDTA, 0.4 EGTA, 8 Na2 ATP, 10 Na2 CP
(creatine phosphate), pH 7.2. LS was a mixture of HA and HR titrated to a free Ca2+ of ‚àº300 nM to
reload the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) for deÔ¨Åned incubation times. RS served as release solution
for Ca2+ ions from the SR and was LR supplemented with 30 mM caffeine. All solutions were
thawed from stocks at the day of experiments and freshly supplemented with creatine kinase (CK,
Sigma/Roche, Germany) to ‚àº300 U/ml or ‚àº3 U/well and sodium azide (0.1 M NaN3 ), the latter to
prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake Fry et al. (1989). To initially chemically permeabilize a single
Ô¨Åber, saponin was added to HR in a separate well of the MyoRobot rack to a concentration of 0.1%
(w/v).

Preparation of single muscle Ô¨Åbers
Mice were anaesthetized via isoÔ¨Çurane inhalation and sacriÔ¨Åced by cervical dislocation. The hind
limbs were cut off and transferred to Krebs-solution. SOL and EDL muscles were dissected under a
stereo-microscope (Olympus SZX7, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany), while being pinned under slight
stretch into a Sylgard (Dow Corning, Wiesbaden, Germany) coated petri dish. Upon completing the
dissection, Krebs-Solution was exchanged for HKS, allowing for 15 min equilibration, before single
Ô¨Åbers were manually dissected with Ô¨Åne forceps.

Assessment of active and passive biomechanics in single muscle Ô¨Åbers in an automated MyoRobot environment
Biomechanics recordings were conducted using the MyoRobot, a novel automated biomechatronics
system combining high precision voice coil actuation (VCA) with force sensor technology Haug
et al. (2018). After isolation, the single Ô¨Åber segment (length at least 2 mm) was transferred to the
MyoRobot multi-well rack in a custom-made Perspex chamber while submerged in HKS solution,
placed below the pins of the force transducer and VCA and Ô¨Åxed to both pins via a tweezer
mechanism. For details on the biomechatronics system and sensor, and actuation implementation,
refer to Haug et al. (2018). Every protocol started with a chemical permeabilization of single Ô¨Åbers in
HR supplemented with saponin for 20 s. An automated set of biomechanical recordings on the same
preparation was then executed, consisting of sequential runs of (i) caffeine-induced, Ca2+ -mediated
force generation, (ii) pCa-force curves, (iii) speed of shortening (slack-test), (iv) passive elasticity ‚Äì
resting length-tension curve (RLT) and (v) assessment of visco-elastic passive behaviour:
‚Ä¢ Caffeine-induced, Ca2+ -mediated force generation: After Ô¨Åber permeabilization, the Ô¨Åber
was shortly dipped into HR to wash off remaining saponin and to buffer internal Ca2+ . Subsequently, it was translocated to LR for 60 s, after which the SR was loaded in LS for 60 s. The
caffeine-induced force transient was triggered by exposure to RS for 60 s, while maximum
force was induced via HA solution for 5 s (Fig. 1).
‚Ä¢ Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, pCa-force curves: The Ô¨Åber was sequentially exposed to solutions of increasing Ca2+ ion concentrations (decreasing pCa values
(-log10 [Ca2+ ])) for a duration of 20 s (Fig. 2).
‚Ä¢ Unloaded speed of shortening (‚Äôslack-test‚Äô): The muscle Ô¨Åber was held at resting length L0
and transferred to HA solution, resulting in maximum isometric contraction. Upon achieving
steady-state force, the VCA pin moved at maximum speed towards the force transducer,
slacking the Ô¨Åber by a deÔ¨Åned percentage of L0 (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or 55%) as
force dropped to 0 mN. While taking up the slack, force re-established in the presence of
saturating Ca2+ . Once the next force-plateau was reached, the Ô¨Åber was washed in HR to
remove excessive Ca2+ and to relax the myoÔ¨Åbrils before moving on to the consecutive ‚Äôslack
length‚Äô. For this recording, sampling rate was set to 2 kHz (Fig. 3).
‚Ä¢ Passive elasticity ‚Äì RLT curves: To assess passive axial elasticity, the muscle Ô¨Åber was kept
in LR solution to avoid active contraction. The Ô¨Åber was continuously stretched at a slow
speed (0.44 ùúám/s) to 140% of L0 (L0 ‚àº1,950 ùúám) by moving the actuator pin away from the
force transducer pin. Restoration force was continuously recorded. To every 10% stretch bin,
a linear Ô¨Åt was applied to calculate the Ô¨Åber‚Äôs compliance, reÔ¨Çected by the inverse of that
slope and thus, the inverse of stiffness (Fig. 4).
‚Ä¢ Visco-elastic passive behaviour: To assess the visco-elastic passive behaviour, the Ô¨Åber was
stretched in a sudden staircase-like pattern in 10% L0 steps to 160% L0 with a holding time
of 10 s. To prevent any active contraction, the Ô¨Åber was kept in LR during the recording. The
force response of the Ô¨Åber comprised of an instantaneous passive restoration force and a
force relaxation, with an exponential decay of force back to a steady-state level (Fig. 5).

Data analysis and statistics

571

MyoRobot data were processed with analysis protocols in RStudio (RStudio Inc., rstudio.com) while
plotted and statistically evaluated with SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc., sigmaplot.co.uk). All data
traces were smoothed with a moving average Ô¨Ålter. For pCa-curves, the plateau force close to the
end of each pCa step was determined by the software and plotted against the corresponding pCa
value. The scatter plot of normalized force (normalized to max. force at pCa 4.92) was Ô¨Åtted to a
‚àíùëèùë•
four-parameter Hill-equation (ùë¶ = ùë¶0 + ùëêùëé‚àó10
) utilizing least-square methods with the physiological
ùëè +10‚àíùëèùë•
constraints y0 = 0 and a = 1. The steepness (b, Hill-coeÔ¨Écient) and the deÔ¨Çection point (‚àíùëôùëúùëî10 ([ùê∂ùëé2+ ]),
pCa50 ) of every individual curve Ô¨Åt were used to reconstruct a mean Ô¨Åt to the averaged data points
(Fig. 2). For speed of shortening (slack-tests), a 5% threshold criterion was established from the
maximum isometric force of the Ô¨Årst slack. This threshold deÔ¨Åned signiÔ¨Åcant ‚Äòforce redevelopment‚Äô
for this and all consecutive ‚Äôslack lengths‚Äô (dL). The time needed to cross this force-threshold
was called ‚Äôslack time‚Äô (dt) and was plotted against the respective ‚Äôslack length‚Äô dL. The resulting
dt-dL-scatter plot was Ô¨Åtted with a bi-exponential function (ùë¶ = ùëé(1 ‚àí ùëíùúÖ1+ùëëùë° ) + ùëê(1 ‚àí ùëíùúÖ2+ùëëùë° )). Its
derivative represented the non-linear slack-length dependent shortening velocity v(dL). The dL-dt
range was divided in a fast (unloaded phase, <45% ‚Äôslack length‚Äô) and a slow phase (internally
loaded phase, >45% ‚Äôslack length‚Äô) as described in Haug et al. (2018) Haug et al. (2018). Passive
elasticity - RLT curves: To every 10% L0 stretch bin, a linear Ô¨Åt was applied and the respective
increase / steepness computed to obtain axial elasticity and compliance (inverse increase). Viscoelastic behaviour: The force baseline (F0 ) was determined as the last 5 s before the Ô¨Årst step while
absolute restoration force (ùêπùëéùëèùë† = ùëöùëéùë•ùëõ‚àó10% ‚àí ùêπ0 ) of each 10% stretch-step was calculated as the
difference of maximum recorded force of the corresponding step to the baseline. Force relaxation
was obtained from the difference between maximum and minimum force recorded within the
same step (ùêπùëüùëíùëôùëéùë• = ùëöùëéùë•ùëõ‚àó10% ‚àí ùëöùëñùëõùëõ‚àó10% ). Statistical signiÔ¨Åcance was assessed by applying two-way
ANOVA tests (age bins and genotypes as variables), following post-hoc analysis (Tukey, Bonferroni) in
SigmaPlot. SigniÔ¨Åcance levels of P < 0.05 were considered signiÔ¨Åcant, < 0.01 and < 0.001 considered
strongly and highly signiÔ¨Åcant, respectively. SigniÔ¨Åcance levels involving age effects were depicted
as #, while genotype differences were depicted as ¬ß: wt vs. het, %: wt vs. hom, and @: het vs. hom,
respectively.

Figure 4. Visco-elastic behaviour of single muscle Ô¨Åbers from EDL and SOL muscle carrying the R349P
desmin mutation during ageing. A, representative examples of quick step-stretch experiment protocols
stretching adult EDL and SOL Ô¨Åbers in 10% bins to 160% L0 . B, Kaplan-Meier curves displaying the percentage of
intact Ô¨Åbers during the protocol demonstrate a worsened stretch-resistance of mutant Ô¨Åbers. C, group analysis
of FùëÖ across ages in EDL (top) and SOL (bottom) Ô¨Åbers showing overall increased absolute restoration force
levels in the mutants over the wt for almost all ages and in both muscles. D, force relaxation amplitudes with
stretch suggest almost similar viscous relaxation with a tendency for higher viscous relaxation in mutant Ô¨Åbers
over the wt. Error bars: standard error.

Figure 5. The fast phase of unloaded speed of shortening in single EDL and SOL Ô¨Åber segments from
adult, aged and senile R349P desmin mice is markedly increased in aged mutation-bearing Ô¨Åbers. A,
representative ‚Äôslack-test‚Äô recordings of a single senile EDL (left) and aged SOL (right) Ô¨Åber. The ‚Äôslack time‚Äô was
extracted for each ‚Äôslack length‚Äô and the dL-dt relationship plotted in the right subpanels along with a
biexponential Ô¨Åt and a linear velocity approximation in the lower dL (fast) and upper dL (slow) regime. B, group
analyses of all single Ô¨Åbers from each genotype and age described by biexponential Ô¨Åt curves. The group
analysis of the linear fast (vùëì ùëéùë†ùë° ) and slow (vùë†ùëôùëúùë§ ) phase for all Ô¨Åbers of each genotype and muscle is shown in (C).
Shortening speed consistently increased in wt Ô¨Åbers with age, while particularly het samples reveal a maximum
shortening velocity for aged Ô¨Åbers. In hom Ô¨Åbers, shortening speeds also increased with age and only displayed
a single decline for senile EDL muscle. Numbers next to symbol legends: number of single Ô¨Åbers analysed.
