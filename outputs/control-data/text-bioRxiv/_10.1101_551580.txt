ABSTRACT
Protein homeostasis is crucial for viability of all organisms and the development of
many different human pathologies are caused by mutations that enhance protein
aggregation. For example, several forms of muscular dystrophy are caused by mutations
that enhance protein aggregation in muscle cells. Here, we report that unc-1/Stomatin
like protein 3 functions in the nervous system to maintain appropriate protein
homeostasis in muscle cells. We show that UNC-1 regulates protein aggregation in
muscle cells by antagonizing neurohormonal signalling from the cytosolic
sulfotransferase SSU-1, which functions in the ASJ sensory neurons, to the nuclear
hormone receptor NHR-1 in muscle cells. In addition, we demonstrate that this
signalling pathway functions antagonistically to a second hormonal signalling pathway
that signals via the DAF-12/vitamin D receptor to regulate protein homeostasis. Our
results indicate that protein aggregation in muscle cells is controlled by multiple
hormonal signalling pathways that function cell-nonautonomously. In addition, our data
suggest that abnormal hormonal signalling might contribute to some of the pathologies
caused by protein aggregation.

BACKGROUND
Protein homeostasis is essential to maintain appropriate cell function. This consists of
both, an adequate expression of specific sets of proteins and proper folding and
localisation of these molecules. When proteins do not fold correctly they tend to expose
hydrophobic domains, which normally lay in the interior of the protein, to the cytoplasm
and therefore become prone to aggregation between themselves and other proteins.
These aggregates are very toxic and can substantially alter the function of cells and
cause disease1. To prevent the formation of aggregates there are natural mechanisms to
control proper folding of proteins and to remove proteins that are already misfolded2.
Once a considerable amount of proteins have collapsed, due to improper folding, they
induce stress in the cytoplasm, by poisoning the machinery of the proteasome for
example, which in turn activates unfolded protein response (UPRs) pathways3. UPR
signals activate nuclear transcription factors that induce expression of genes associated
with folding and degradation of proteins, autophagy, among other protective processes3.
While many UPR signals are thought to function cell-autonomously, recent studies of
C. elegans have demonstrated that cell-nonautonomous pathways also regulate protein
aggregation. For example, chemical synaptic function in neurons was shown to regulate
polyglutamine (polyQ) misfolding in muscle cells4, 5. Specifically, Silva and co-workers
showed that a small increase in physiological cholinergic signalling, at the motor
synapses, induced a calcium-dependent activation of muscular HSF-1, which in turns
activates the expression of chaperons that protect against protein aggregation5. Despite
these and similar observations, the mechanisms by which neuronal signalling can
control protein aggregation in distant tissues remains unknown.
Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) comprise a group of transcription factors that
regulate the expression of genes in a ligand binding-dependent manner. These ligands
are usually lipid molecules, such as steroid hormones6. After ligand binding, NHRs
dimerise (homo- and heterodimers) and bind DNA domains in the vicinity of promoters.
The wide range of metabolic processes regulated by NHRs has made them outstanding
druggable targets against inflammation, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases
(reviewed in refs. 7-11). Interestingly, it has been described that stress responses in the
ER can be modulated by the function of NHRs. For example, the nuclear hormone
receptor liver homolog-1 (LRH-1) is required to reduce stress in the ER, in type 2

diabetes mellitus mice models7, 8. Moreover, the thyroid hormone receptor α, which is
essential to maintain postnatal pancreatic β-cells, is required to reduce oxidative stress
in the ER in these cells, to avoid apoptotic death9.
In this manuscript, we report the isolation of a mutant allele in unc-1, a gene encoding
one of the stomatin-like proteins in C. elegans, that enhances polyQ aggregation in
muscle cells. We show that UNC-1 functions in neurons, likely by controlling electrical
synapse function, to regulate protein homeostasis in distant tissues. Disruption of UNC1 function causes a malfunction of ASJ sensory neurons which excretes a sulfated signal
and activates NHR-1 in muscle cells. Activation of NHR-1 down-regulates components
of the ER stress response and this compromises proteostasis in muscle cells. In addition,
we show that signalling through DAF-12, a NHR related to the mammalian vitamin D
receptor, functions antagonistically to signalling via NHR-1 to control protein
aggregation, indicating that multiple hormonal signalling pathways control protein
aggregation in C. elegans. Finally, our experiments present evidence of the first
example of a NHR where activation induces disruption of protein homeostasis.

RESULTS
EMS screening and isolation of unc-1 as a modulator of polyQ aggregation
García and co-workers have shown that signalling from chemical synapses modulates
protein homeostasis4. However, little is known about upstream and downstream
processes involved in this regulation. To expand our knowledge on these signalling
pathways controlling protein homeostasis we did an EMS screening to find regulatory
genes (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Material and Methods), in a worm model of polyQ
aggregation10. We used animals that express 40 glutamines in frame with a yellow
fluorescent protein (40Q::YFP) in muscle cells. In these animals, 40Q::YFP aggregates
in an age-dependent manner and forms inclusion bodies that can be observed and
counted under a dissecting microscope (Fig. 1a, b). Among several mutants, we
obtained a mutant strain, RVM10 that carries the allele vlt10, which substantially
enhanced the aggregation pattern (Fig. 1b, c). In addition to the enhanced polyQ
aggregation pattern, the vlt10 animals showed a kinky phenotype (or Unc phenotype,
from uncoordinated), suggesting that this mutation may affect the function of the
nervous system and/or muscle cells.
To determine the molecular identity of this allele we sequenced the genome of this
strain after six outcrossing steps and also the genome of the original strain (RVM10).
EMS causes random lesions through the chromosomes and after outcrossing RVM10
most of these mutations would be lost except the DNA changes that lay around the
allele responsible for the aggregation phenotype. We took advantage of this, and when
we compared both genomes we observed a region with dense amount of mutations that
“peaked” around the left arm of chromosome X (Fig. 1d). Detailed analysis of this
region showed that the unc-1 gene of RVM10 had a nonsense mutation that gives rise to
a premature stop codon (Fig. 1e). unc-1 encodes a homologue of the Stomatin-like
protein (SLP) family from mammals11, most closely related to STOML3 (Fig. 1e and
Supplementary Fig. S1). The product of this gene has been shown to be involved in
modulation of the electrical synapse12 and sensitivity to anaesthetics13. Null alleles of
this gene are well-known to cause strong uncoordination in C. elegans12, similar to vlt10
mutants from our screen.
Depletion of unc-1/Stomatin-like protein enhances polyglutamine aggregation

To test if the loss of unc-1 is responsible for the enhanced aggregation phenotype of
vlt10 mutants, we introduced known mutant alleles of unc-1 (e179 and e1598) in
40Q::YFP expressing animals. Analysis of the inclusion bodies produced by the
aggregation of polyQs showed that indeed mutations in unc-1 phenocopy the
aggregation pattern of vlt10 mutants (Fig. 1f). However, the vlt10 allele seems to
produce a weaker phenotype than e179 or e1598, suggesting that although it is a
nonsense mutation unc-1, it may somehow produce a protein with partial function. We
also cannot rule out that an unknown unc-1-linked mutation may be reducing the protein
aggregation phenotype of vlt10 mutants.
We investigated whether unc-1(vlt10) would modify the aggregation phenotype of a
strain expressing 35Q::YFP in body wall muscles. These animals are believed to have a
weaker protein aggregation phenotype than animals expressing 40Q::YFP, and they
only accumulate inclusion bodies at very late adult stages10. Analysis of 35Q::YFP in
unc-1(vlt10) mutants showed that the vlt10 allele is able to enhance the phenotype of
these animals to a similar extent as other unc-1 alleles, e179 and e1598 (Fig. 1g).
Altogether, these data strongly suggest that unc-1 is required to prevent aggregation of
polyQ proteins.
unc-1 is required in the nervous system to maintain protein homeostasis
UNC-1, the product of the unc-1 gene, is expressed both thorough the nervous system
and in muscle cells12-14. To investigate whether the function of UNC-1 is required in a
specific tissue, we reintroduced the cDNA of unc-1, under the control of the promoter of
myo-3 (myo-3p), a gene that is exclusively expressed in muscle cells15 in 40Q::YFP;
unc-1(vlt10) animals. Analysis of the aggregation patterns showed that this construct
did not rescue the aggregation pattern in larvae, although it produced a small reduction
of inclusion bodies in young adult worms (Supplementary Fig. S2a and data not shown).
By contrast, when we reintroduced unc-1 in the nervous system, using a pan-neuronal
promoter, from the gene rab-316, they showed a substantial reduction of the aggregation
phenotype in all stages (Fig. 2a and 2b). In addition, introduction of a dominant
negative form of unc-1 (i.e. a cDNA of unc-1 bearing the n494 allele17) (unc-1(nd)), in
the nervous system increases the number of inclusion bodies (Figure 2c). All these data
suggests that unc-1 is required in the nervous system to regulate protein homeostasis in
body wall muscles.

The results of the tissue-specific expression of unc-1, unc-1(RNAi) and expression of
unc-1(nd) further support the hypotheses that unc-1(vlt10) is the mutation responsible of
the enhanced aggregation of the RVM10 worms.
Selective depletion of the electrical synapse increases polyQ aggregation
The C. elegans genome encodes three other neuronally expressed SLP genes23. Analysis
of the other two neuronally expressed SLPs genes18, mec-2 (mechanosensory neurons)
and unc-24 (wide neuronal expression) showed that only unc-24 mutants have a
phenotype comparable to unc-1 mutants, suggesting that not all neuronal SLP genes are
involved in the regulation of polyQ aggregation (Table 1).
Since unc-1 mutants show a defect of motor coordination due, potentially, to a disrupted
electrical synapse, we sought to investigate whether polyQ aggregation in muscle cells
is a general result of disrupted electrical synapse function. To test this we introduced
mutant alleles of genes encoding innexins, which are known components of the
electrical synapse, to investigate the effects of these mutations on polyQ aggregation in
muscle cells. Innexins are transmembrane proteins that form gap junctions between
cells, including electrical synapses between neurons and neuromuscular synapses
(please see Altun et al., for a review19). Specifically, we introduced mutant alleles of all
innexins widely expressed in the nervous system (unc-7, unc-9, and inx-7), and two
expressed in a restricted set of neurons (inx-2 and inx-6), into a polyQ background
(Table 1). From this analysis, we observed that mutants of two of the innexins
expressed widely in the nervous system (unc-7 and unc-9), reproduce the phenotype of
unc-1 (Table 1). Of the innexins expressed in a particular set of neurons, only inx-2
increased polyQ aggregation, suggesting that disrupting electrical synapse function, in
specific neurons, promotes protein aggregation in muscle cells.
Ablation of the sulfotransferase gene ssu-1 rescues unc-1-associated protein
homeostasis unbalance
Carroll and co-workers showed that mutant alleles of ssu-1, a gene that encodes the only
known cytosolic sulfotransferase in the C. elegans genome, partially rescues
uncoordinated locomotion of unc-1 defective worms, among other phenotypes18.
Cytosolic sulfotransferases are promiscuous enzymes that are able to add a sulfate

moiety to a variety of molecules such as steroid hormones and xenobiotics targeted for
elimination (reviewed by Gamage et al.,20).
To investigate the potential role of ssu-1 as an interactor of unc-1, in regard to protein
homeostasis, we introduced the insertion expressing 40Q::YFP in body wall muscle
cells into a strain containing the loss-of-function alleles ssu-1(fc73) and unc-1(e580),
ssu-1 single mutant animals did not exhibit a modified aggregation phenotype (Fig. 3b).
However, consistent with previous observations, we found that mutations in ssu-1
suppressed the effects caused by mutations in unc-1 on protein aggregation in muscle
cells (Fig. 3b).
SSU-1 is only expressed in a single pair of sensory neurons, the ASJ neurons23. To test
whether SSU-1 functions in the ASJ sensory neurons to regulate protein aggregation in
muscle cells we induced cell-specific RNAi against this gene21, 22. Briefly, we injected
into a 40Q::YFP; unc-1(vlt10) background sense and antisense DNA fragments of ssu-1
fused to the promoter of trx-1, which is known to be expressed exclusively in ASJ
neurons23. Expression from trx-1p of these inverted ssu-1 fragments produces sense and
antisense RNA of this gene, which hybridizes to become dsRNA and induces RNAi
against ssu-1. As expected, reducing the expression of ssu-1 in ASJ partially rescued the
aggregation phenotype of unc-1 (Fig. 3c). These data indicate that SSU-1 activity in the
ASJ sensory neurons is required for the disrupted protein homeostasis in muscle cells
exhibited by unc-1 mutants.
Arylsulfatase activity modulates the aggregation dynamics of polyQs
Our results suggest that SSU-1 produces a sulfonated signalling molecule in unc-1
mutants and that this sulfonated molecule promotes the aggregation of polyQs in muscle
cells. Thus, we hypothesised that removal of sulfate from the signal may alter the
aggregation phenotype. To test this hypothesis we sought to disrupt sulfatases, which
are enzymes that remove sulfate moieties from small molecules. There are only three
genes encoding potential enzymes with predicted sulfatase activity in C. elegans: sul-1,
sul-2 and sul-3 24. sul-1 encodes a predicted protein with similarity to mammalian 6-Oendosulfatases (www.wormbase.org; and Fig. 3a) and sul-2 and sul-3 predicted
enzymes are closely related to arylsulfatases (www.wormbase.org; and Fig. 3a). We
sought to investigate whether disruption of any of these enzymes alters the aggregation
pattern of unc-1 animals using RNAi to inhibit gene expression. Analysis of animals fed

bacteria expressing dsRNA targeting each of the three genes showed that reduction of
function of both sul-2 and sul-3 decreased the aggregation pattern observed in unc-1
mutants (Fig. 3d). In contrast, sul-1(RNAi) animals did not show a reduction of
inclusion bodies (Fig. 3d), which suggests that only arylsulfatase function is able to
modulate aggregation of polyQs in unc-1 mutants. Then we analysed the aggregation
phenotype of the only arylsulfatase mutant available, sul-2(gk187), and observed that
ablation of sul-2 substantially reduces the aggregation phenotype of unc-1 mutants (Fig.
3e). These results indicate that arylsulfatase activity regulates protein homeostasis,
possibly by antagonizing the sulfonation of the target of SSU-1.
The Nuclear Hormone Receptor NHR-1 modulates protein homeostasis
The activity of both sulfotransferases and sulfatases regulates signalling via nuclear
hormone receptors (NHR), by adding or removing a sulfate moiety to hormones, or their
precursors (reviewed by He et al.,

25

). Inversely, NHRs are able to modulate the

expression of genes encoding these enzymes, through negative feedback loops operated
by their enzymatic products 26. Interestingly, Burton and co-workers showed that the C.
elegans sulfotransferase SSU-1 controls hormonal signalling through NHR-1 to regulate
insulin sensitivity and specificity 27. These data provided us with a hint about a potential
downstream effector of SSU-1 in the context of the phenotype shown by unc-1 mutants.
Therefore, we decided to test whether the same signalling pathway was involved in the
modulation of the polyQ aggregation phenotype observed in unc-1 mutants. To do so,
we introduced mutant alleles of nhr-1 in a 40Q::YFP; unc-1 background. We used gene
editing by CRISPR to generate a lesion in nhr-1, vlt16, reproducing the allele described
by Burton et al., n624227, in the 40Q::YFP; unc-1 background. Additionally, we
isolated and characterized a new allele of nhr-1, vlt15, which was produced by an
abnormal homologous recombination and is a potential null (Supplemental Fig. S3b, c).
Analysis of both mutant alleles showed that disruption of NHR-1 in the unc-1
background produces a substantial reduction of inclusion bodies (Fig. 5a), indicating
that NHR-1 acts downstream of SSU-1 signalling to regulate protein homeostasis.
NHR-1 seems to be the target of a signal produced by SSU-1 in ASJ, but in which tissue
the function of this nuclear receptor is required? To answer this question, we sought to
reintroduce NHR-1 in body wall muscles, using the promoter of the unc-54 gene27. We
found that expressing NHR-1 specifically in muscle cells partially restored the

aggregation phenotype shown by unc-1 worms (Fig. 5b), which demonstrates that NHR1 function is required cell autonomously to regulate protein homeostasis.
Similar to our observations of protein homeostasis, we found that disruption of nhr-1
also restored motility in unc-1 mutants and that this effect on motility was reversed
when a wild-type copy of NHR-1 was expressed specifically in muscle cells (Fig. 5c).
These results suggest that the immobility observed in unc-1 mutants might be caused by
protein aggregation in muscle cells.
NHR-1 regulates transcription of molecules involved in protein homeostasis
To further understand how UNC-1 and NHR-1 antagonistically regulate protein
homeostasis we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on unc-1(vlt10) mutants and
wild-type animals. Analysis of the transcriptome of these animals showed that a
substantial number of genes, in a range of pathways, were dysregulated in the unc1(vlt10) animals. Among them many genes related to synaptic signalling were up- or
down-regulated. For example, Bonferroni analysis shows that genes involved in Gprotein coupled receptor signalling (GO:0007186) are upregulated in unc-1 animals
(50% upregulated, p-value= 0 and p-value adjusted=0.028) (Supplementary Table S1).
neuropeptides, G proteins, etc. (Supplementary Table S1).
Interestingly, this analysis showed that genes involved in the response to unfolded
protein stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were upregulated in unc-1 mutants
(Supplementary Fig. S4). This upregulation of genes involved in unfolded protein stress
and ER stress might be due to increased protein aggregation, similar to our observations
of enhanced polyQ aggregation in unc-1 mutants.
Since our RNA-seq data showed that the expression of many genes involved in protein
homeostasis maintenance are upregulated in unc-1 mutants, we sought to evaluate the
level of expression of some of these genes in nhr-1 mutants. We chose to analyse genes
from the unfolded protein response (UPR) of mitochondria (dve-1, atfs-1 and hsp-60),
UPR of the endoplasmic reticulum (pek-1, rtcb-1, ire-1 and atf-6) and the heat shock
response (hsp-16.41) in unc-1; 40Q and unc-1; nhr-1; 40Q worms, to investigate if the
expression of these genes correlated with our phenotypic data. Our experiments showed
worms lacking nhr-1 have reduced expression of some of the components of these
pathways when compared to unc-1 mutants (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results are

consistent with our phenotypic data and suggest that NHR-1 functions by controlling
the expression of genes involved in protein homeostasis.
Activation of the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12 reduces polyQ aggregation
Although there is no evidence, to our knowledge, that dafachronic acids (DAs) are
substrates and/or products of sulfotransferases or sulfatases, we sought to test whether
the signal from ASJ, produced by SSU-1 and responsible for the phenotype of unc-1
animals, could be DAs. These steroids induce opposing effects on longevity, depending
of the genetic and metabolic context of the worms28. The target of these hormones is
DAF-12, a steroid hormone receptor homologous to mammalian vitamin D receptor.
Hence, we decided to investigate whether DAF-12 modulates the phenotype of
40Q::YFP; unc-1 animals. We generated a lesion in daf-12, vlt17, reproducing the allele
daf-12(rh257) using gene editing through CRISPR. Animals carrying this allele produce
a DAF-12 receptor unable to bind DAs29. However, homozygous 40Q::YFP; unc1(vlt10); daf-12(vlt17) double mutants were synthetic lethal, so we could not analyse
them. In consonance with this, 40Q::YFP; daf-12(vlt17) animals showed a substantial
increase in the number of polyQ aggregates (Fig. 4a).
To further confirm these data, we investigated the effect of disrupting DA biosynthesis,
using dafadine A, a compound that inhibits enzymatic activity of DAF-9, a P450
cytochrome essential for DA synthesis30,

31

. Culturing worms on this compound

32

phenocopies loss-of-function alleles of daf-9 . We treated L1 40Q::YFP animals with
different concentrations of dafadine A (1, 5, 12.5 µM), and observed that this substance,
similar to loss of DAF-12 activity, induced dose-dependent increases in polyQaggregates (Fig. 4b). Then, we analysed the behaviour of the 40Q::YFP worms cultured
on 1 µM Δ4-DA, and we observed a reduced amount of polyQ aggregates (Fig. 4c). To
confirm these results, we evaluated the effect of both dafadine A and Δ4-DA in worms
expressing polyQs in mechanosensory neurons (112Q), which are defective in touch
response (under review Sanchis et al.). The Δ4-DA treatment produced improvement of
the touch response in 112Q animals, while dafadine A treatment decreased touch
response (Fig. 4d).Collectively, these data suggest that steroid hormone signalling
through DAF-12 is required to maintain protein homeostasis and functions
antagonistically to hormone signalling via NHR-1. Furthermore, these data demonstrate
that multiple hormonal signalling pathways likely function cell-nonautonomously to

regulate protein homeostasis in C. elegans.
Metabolomics analysis of unc-1 mutants shows altered lipid metabolic signatures
Since our genetic analysis strongly suggests that a steroid hormone is involved in the
protein homeostasis dysfunction observed in unc-1 mutants, we sought to perform an
untargeted metabolomics analysis, to explore whether any steroid species were different
between unc-1 and wild type animals.
In the OPLS-DA model, the separation between unc-1 and wild type animals was
clearly presented (Supplementary Fig. S6) with high R2Y (0.792) and Q2Y (0.527)
parameters, indicating potential biochemical changes between the two worm strains.
The model was satisfactory validated with a 7-fold cross validation method (p CVanova <0.001) and 1000 permutation tests (R2Y- intercept=0.661, Q2Y-intercept=0.318).
We made a Variance Importance in Projection plot (VIP), which summarises the
contribution of each variable to the discriminant model. Discriminant variables with a
score VIP> 1.0 and a jack-knife confidence interval that did not include 0 were
considered relevant and submitted to identification process. A univariance statistical
analysis (Mann-Whitney test), was also performed in order to investigate which
discriminant metabolites were statistically different between worm strains.
34 metabolites were selected from the VIP plot, for their potential annotation as true
metabolites, and many of them were tentatively annotated as lipids. Among those
metabolites, only 7 were confirmed by at least one of the fragmentation strategies
(Table 2). The feature mz= 311.2019 was of major interest as it was annotated as a
potential steroid or steroid derivative. Although the results show that the abundance of
this metabolite was reduced in unc-1 animals, the differences were not statically
significant. Even though this metabolite may be of great interest, it has not been
possible to fully confirm its identity with chemical standard, so the question about
which steroid hormone is signalling through NHR-1 remains open and more in-depth
metabolomics studies might need to be performed to identify the hormones that regulate
protein homeostasis in C. elegans.

DICUSSION

Progressive malfunction of protein homeostasis is a natural side effect of the process of
ageing in all organisms. Many pathways and molecules have been shown to influence
this process, and they function by regulating several diverse processes including
maintaining appropriate protein folding and localization. Deleterious mutations in genes
encoding components of some of these modulatory pathways accelerate the decline of
protein homeostasis, and contribute to the progression of age-related disorders33.
In this work we show that disruption of the electrical synapse, by ablation of unc1/Stomatin like protein 3, causes overproduction of neurohormonal signalling from ASJ
neurons, which in turns impairs protein homeostasis in a cell-nonautonomously fashion.
Disruption of proteostasis in these mutants requires the function of SSU-1, the only
know cytosolic sulfotransferase in the C. elegans genome18, which suggest that these
hormones need to be sulfated to induce protein aggregation. When these signals reach
the target tissue the sulfate moiety must be removed to bind their target, the nuclear
hormone receptor NHR-1. In contrast, we show that activation of the DAF12/Vitamin D
receptor, another steroid hormone signalling pathway, functions antagonistically to
NHR-1 to maintain protein homeostasis.
Several studies have suggested that neurosteroids may induce protection against
neurodegenerative diseases that involves dysregulation of protein homeostasis, such as
Alzheimer, Parkinson or Huntington diseases (see Borowicz et al., for a review34). To
our knowledge, this is the first report showing that different steroid hormone signals
have opposing modulator effects in protein homeostasis in animals, and it will be of
interest to investigate if this is evolutionary conserved between invertebrates and
mammals. If similar effects of hormonal signalling on protein homeostasis are
conserved, then it is likely that such pathways are amenable to be modified using drugs.
For example, there exist inhibitors against sulfotransferases35, the cytochrome daf-9/
CYP2J236, sulfatases37 and modulators of NHRs38-42, which are being investigated to
treat different kinds of cancer and metabolic diseases. Therefore, we predict that such
signalling molecules are potential targets to treat pathological conditions produced by
toxic protein aggregates such as neurodegeneration. Finally, our work provides an in
vivo genetically tractable model, C. elegans, to study these opposing hormonal signals

Maintenance and culture of C. elegans
All strains were maintained under standard conditions43. Some strains used in this work
were obtained from Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC; Minneapolis, MN, USA).
The CGC is funded by the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Research
Resources (NGRR). ssu-1(fc73)V; unc-1(e580)X was kindly provided by Phillip G.
Morgan. Supplementary Table S3 provides a detailed list of strains used in this study.
All strains were outcrossed at least three times.
Plasmid construction, genetic manipulation of worms and transgenesis
Each primer used in this work is described in Supplementary Table S4. To produce the

constructs for tissue-specific rescue and overexpression experiments, we amplified the
promoter of the rab-3 gene using the APG315-APG316 primers from wild type gDNA.
We cloned the PCR product into pDONRP1P5r using the Gateway system (Invitrogen,
Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) to generate pDONRP1P5r-rab-3p (pAPG1). We
amplified the cDNA of unc-1 from wild type gDNA using RVM321-RVM239 to obtain
pDONRP5P2-unc-1 (pAPG2). We used pDONRP1P5r-myo-3p kindly provided by H.
Baylis. Plasmids containing each promoter, were fused with the cDNA of unc-1, using
multisite Gateway system, within a destination vector that contains the transcription
terminator from the gene unc-54, pHP244, to generate the following destination
constructs:

pDESTHP2-rab-3p::unc-1::unc-54t

(pAPG3)

and

pDESTHP2-myo-

3p::unc-1::unc-54t (pAPG4). To induce nhr-1 expression in muscle cells we used
pVD10527.
To produce a dominant negative form of unc-1, the n494 allele17, we used RVM600RVM601 (plasmid pAPG5). We used pAPG1 and pAPG5 as donor vectors and pHP2 as
destination vector, to generate pAPG6.
DNA mixtures for injection consisted of 50 ng/μl of the interest DNA [except for myo3p expression analysis (1-5 ng/μl)], a DNA marker (myo-2p::GFP) at 2.5-5 ng/μl,
together with the empty yeast plasmid pYES (Thermofisher, Waltham, Massachusetts,
USA) as carrier DNA, at a total final concentration of 120 ng/μl. We injected each mix
as described elsewhere45.
Construction of knock-in worms using CRISPR

We used CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce point mutations into both daf12 and nhr-1.
We based on our design and strategy using a modified protocol from the Ceron’s Lab
(IDIBELL Institute, Barcelona, Spain)46. We employed Alt-R™ S.p. Cas9 Nuclease
3NLS, and two RNAs to produce the gRNA: Alt-R™ CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA and AltR™ CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA from IDTDNA (Coralville, IA, USA). The guide RNA
sequences used to target the genes were: 5ʹ-ATATTATGGATGTTACCATGAGG-3ʹ
for daf-12 (rh257 allele) and 5ʹ - CACCACTCCACACCGTCTTCAGG-3ʹ for nhr-1
(n6242 allele).
The ssODN sequences to induce knock-ins to generate the allele of interest were: 5ʹGAGTCTTCTCAACAGGTAATCAATCAACGGATAAAGAAGATATTACAAAAC

produce the mixture for injection, the crRNAs were suspended in 20 μl of IDTE
nuclease free buffer for 100 μM stock. ssODNs were suspended in the same buffer at 1
μg/μl. CRISPR components were added at the following final concentrations: Cas9: 4,5
μM; ALT-R trackRNA: 32 μM; target gene crRNA: 35 μM; ssODN target gene: 175
ng/μl. We used disruption of dyp-10 gene as a selection marker as described 47.
RNA interference
To produce constructs for tissue-specific RNAi we used fusion PCR48, to produce
constructs as described elsewhere21, 22. We used the promoters of the genes rab-3 and
trx-1 to silence unc-1 and ssu-1 genes in the nervous system and ASJ sensory neurons,
respectively. We used a DNA fragment from the bacterial β-Lactamases gene (which we
named AMPr) as negative control in the RNAi experiments. We injected 2,5 ng/μl of each
construct together with pCFJ90 (encodes a pharynx-expressed mCherry as a transgenic marker
49

), as a reporter, and pYES as carrier DNA.

To induce constitutive RNAi against sulfatases, we feed the animals with modified
HT115 E. coli strain expressing dsRNA of each gene. We generated RNAi vectors for
these genes cloning a coding fragment of each, into an EcoRV site of pL4440. The PCR

product for each gene was amplified using Phusion polymerase (Thermofisher,
Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and specific primers (Supplementary Table S4).
HT115 strains containing empty pL4440, as a control, and RNAi vectors (pAPG7,
pAPG8, pAPG9) were grown in liquid Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 µg/ml
carbenicillin over night at 37°C. Feeding RNAi plates contained 50 µg/ml carbenicillin
and 1 mM IPTG. Feeding RNAi plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C to induce dsRNA
before adding worms. L3 animals were feed with feeding bacteria over night at 20°C
and L4 animals were scored.
Quantification of polyQ inclusion bodies in C. elegans
The inclusion bodies (IB) produced by aggregation of polyQs were counted in vivo in
L2, L4 and young adult stages at 20°C. Counting was done, at least, in three
independent experiments. Thirty animals or more were analysed for each genotype and
each independent experiment. The number of IBs was scored using an M165FC Leica
dissecting microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).
Analysis of touch response in C. elegans
Touch response assays were performed scoring for 10 touches on the tail of the animal
for approximately 50 animals. An eyelash, mounted on a toothpick, was gently passed
on the posterior part of the animals, as described elsewhere50. Each assay was repeated
three times.
Liquid thrashing assay
We evaluated the motility of young adults in M9 buffer for 1 minute. Animals were
acclimated for 30 seconds before scoring at 20°C. At least 15-20 animals were analysed
for each genotype and transgenic line in replicate three times.
Analysis of the effect of (25S)-∆4-dafachronic acid (DA) and dafadine A on worms
(25S)-∆4-dafachronic acid (DA) was synthesised as described elsewhere51,

treatment was done as described . Briefly, we grown synchronized L1 animals on DA 1
µM in M9 buffer containing 5 µg/ml cholesterol, 12.5 µg/ml nystatine, 50 µg/ml
streptomycin and OP50 E. coli at 0.5 Optic density. Dafadine A was added at three
concentrations (1, 5 and 12.5 µM)33 using the same culture conditions. We evaluated the

effect of both compounds at least three times in independent experiments. Dafadine A
was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Quantitative PCR
The relative expression of genes was measured by RT-qPCR using the ViiA7 thermal
cycler from Applied Biosystems (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) using Taqman
probes. To verify the expression of genes included within extracromosomal arrays, we
selected by hand worms expressing reporters for RNA extraction (OMEGA Bio-Tek,
Norcross, GA, USA) using a dissecting the M165FC dissecting microscope (Leica). To
evaluate expression of genes in mutants, we collected a mix population of worms. RNA
samples were treated by DNAase treatment (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA
synthesis was done using 0.1-1 μg approximately of RNA following the manufacturer
protocol (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan). We used the 2xPrimeTime® Gene Expression
Master Mix (Takara Bio), and the PCR program was as follows: 1 cycle of 10 min at
50°C; 1 cycle of denaturalization at 95°C 15 s; 40 cycles of polymerization at 60°C 1
min. To normalize relative expression we used the housekeeping control, pmp-3
(Applied biosystems, Ce02485188_m1). unc-1 expression was measured using a probe
from Applied Biosystems (Ce02491558_m1). All other genes (40Q::YFP, ssu-1, rtcb-1,
ire-1, hsp-3, pek-1, atf-6, hsp-60, hsp-70, hsp-16.41, dve-1, atfs-1) were analysed using
customized PCR primers and probes from IDTDNA (Coralville, Iowa, USA). We
considered all isoforms for each gene in the customized design.
Imaging worms by fluorescent microscopy
Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope
(Wetzlar, Germany). Live worms were mounted onto 2% agar pads and were
anaesthetized with a drop of 0.025 M sodium azide.
Statistics
We plotted mean values for number of inclusion bodies, thrashing and touch response
and we analysed the data using ANOVA tests, with Tukey’s multiple comparison test.
When we had to compare two groups we used Mann-Whitney tests.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Fig. 1. A random chemical mutagenesis experiment led to isolation of unc-1 as a
modifier of polyQ aggregation. a) The strategy to isolate mutants involved both in
synaptic signalling and protein homeostasis, consisted in selecting worms that had
different aggregation patterns than wild types, and that were uncoordinated. b) Confocal
microscopy images of L4 larva and young adult vtlt10 mutants and wild type animals. c)
vlt10 mutants shows substantially enhanced polyQ aggregation than controls. d) Highthroughput sequencing showed that the mutation of vlt10 lays in the left arm of the
LGX. e) One possible candidate was unc-1, which had a non-sense mutation in
homozygosis, and encoded a potentially truncated UNC-1 protein. f) Analysis of
different mutant alleles of unc-1 shows that this gene is indeed a potent enhancer of
aggregation of polyQs. g) unc-1 mutants are also able to enhance polyQ aggregation in
worms expressing a track of polyQs that is below of the pathologic threshold (i.e. 35Q).
***: p-value < 0.001. ANOVA Test with post-hoc Tukey.
Fig. 2. UNC-1 is required in the nervous system to modulate protein homeostasis.
a) Expression of the cDNA of unc-1 in the nervous system (NS) completely rescues the
aggregation pattern unc-1 mutants. unc-1 depletion do not affect polyQ expression. b)
Tissue-specific RNAi against unc-1 in the NS increases the number of inclusion bodies
in 40Q::YFP worms, compared to controls (AMPr). c) Overexpression of unc-1 in NS
does not modify aggregation of polyQs, while expression of a dominant negative
mutation of unc-1, n494, enhances the aggregation phenotype. ***: p-value < 0.001.
ANOVA Test with post-hoc Tukey.

rescues protein homeostasis unbalance due to unc-1 absence. a) Diagram showing
the phylogenetic analysis of all sulfatases in the C. elegans genome (sul-1, sul-2 and
sul-3). b) unc-1(e580); ssu-1(fc73) animals show reduction of inclusion bodies
compared to unc-1 animals. c) RNAi against ssu-1 in ASJ neurons decreases
significantly the number of inclusion bodies in unc-1(vlt10) worms. RNAi against E.
coli’s β-lactamase (AMPr) was used as a negative control. d) Knocking-down sul-2 and
sul-3 reduces inclusion bodies in unc-1 mutants. e) The loss-of-function allele of sul-2,
gk187, shows a statistically significant reduced amount of inclusion in unc-1 animals.

Fig. 4. Steroid hormones that signal through daf-12 reduce polyQ aggregation and
are neuroprotective. a) daf-12(vlt17) mutants have enhanced polyQ aggregation. vlt17
was created by CRISPR-induced knock-in, emulating the daf-12(rh257) lesion. b)
Incubation 40Q::YFP worms in dafadine A, an inhibitor of daf-9, increases in an agedependent manner the average number of inclusion bodies. c) Growing 40Q::YFP
worms on (25S)-∆4-dafachronic acid (DA) reduces the average number of inclusion

mechanosensory neurons. In contrast, incubation of worms with dafadine A enhances
neuronal impairment produced by polyQs in mechanosensory neurons. **: p-value <

The vlt15 and vlt16 alleles of nhr-1 rescue the aggregation phenotype in unc-1(vlt10)
mutants. b) Tissue-specific expression of nhr-1 in muscle cells exacerbates aggregation
pattern in double mutants unc-1(vlt10); nhr-1(vlt15). c) Disruption of nhr-1 improves
motility of unc-1 mutants, while restoration of NHR-1 in body wall muscles reduce the
motility capacity of both transgenic lines compared with unc-1(vlt10); nhr-1(vlt15)
worms. *: p-value < 0.05; **: p-value < 0.01; ***: p-value < 0.001. ANOVA Test with

Fig. 6. Diagram showing a working model compatible with the results presented in
this work. a) Animals with functional UNC-1 have normal electric synaptic signaling,
and therefore ASJ neurons produce the right amount of sulfated steroid hormones.
When unc-1 is mutated, ASJ function may be somehow disrupted, which in turns
induces higher production of sulfated steroid hormone by SSU-1. This steroids species
are desulfated by sulfatases, either in the target tissues or in intermediary cells. NHR-1
is the target of these hormones, and when it is targeted by higher concentration of the
signal inhibits genes related to unfolded protein response, among other targets. b) The
nuclear hormone receptors NHR-1 and DAF-12 have opposite effects on protein
homeostasis by modulating the expression of genes.
