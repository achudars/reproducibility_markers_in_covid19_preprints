ABSTRACT
Systems consolidation (SC) theory proposes that recent, contextually rich memories are stored
in the hippocampus (HPC). As these memories become remote, they are believed to rely more
heavily on cortical structures within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where they lose much of their
contextual detail and become schematized. Odor is a particularly evocative cue for intense
remote memory recall and despite these memories being remote, they are highly contextual. In
instances such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), intense remote memory recall can
occur years after trauma, which seemingly contradicts SC. We hypothesized that odor may shift
the organization of salient or fearful memories such that when paired with an odor at the time of
encoding, they are delayed in the de-contextualization process that occurs across time, and
retrieval may still rely on the HPC, where memories are imbued with contextually rich
information, even at remote time points. We investigated this by tagging odor- and non-odorassociated fear memories in male c57BL/6 mice and assessed recall and c-Fos expression in
the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and prelimbic cortex (PL) 1 d or 21 d later. In support of SC, our data
showed that recent memories were more dCA1-dependent whereas remote memories were
more PL-dependent. However, we also found that odor influenced this temporal dynamic
biasing the memory system from the PL to the dCA1 when odor cues were present.
Behaviorally, inhibiting the dCA1 with activity-dependent DREADDs had no effect on recall at 1
d and unexpectedly caused an increase in freezing at 21 d. Together, these findings
demonstrate that odor can shift the organization of fear memories at the systems level.

INTRODUCTION
Remembering personal experiences, or episodic memories, relies upon the integrity of
the hippocampus (HPC) (Scoville and Milner, 1957). When an episodic memory is formed, many
of the contextual elements of the experience are encoded. The set of brain cells, or neuronal
ensembles active during memory formation can be referred to as an engram (Semon, 1921) and
natural recall of an episodic memory involves reactivation of those engrams (Deng et al., 2013;
Tonegawa et al., 2015; Holtmaat and Caroni, 2016). Experiential recall can also be induced by
artificial reactivation of engram cells using genetic tagging and optogenetic or chemogenetic
stimulation.

New memories which, are initially labile, gain stability and permanence through
consolidation. Consolidation is a process of reorganization that occurs within the hours following
the encoding of an experience at the synaptic level (local changes in connectivity), and
gradually over years at the systems level (brain-wide changes in connectivity) (Frankland and
Bontempi, 2005). Some of the first evidence that led researchers to understand the fundamental
necessity of the HPC in the early stages of memory formation and consolidation came from
individuals with hippocampal damage who experienced anterograde amnesia or the inability to
form new memories, as a result. These patients also showed temporally graded retrograde
amnesia (sometimes called the Ribot gradient) (Ribot, 1882) where the magnitude of
hippocampal damage was correlated with the temporal gradient of amnesia. In these
individuals, damage to the HPC was associated with deficits for recently acquired memories,
however, more distant memories were still intact (Zola-Morgan and Squire, 1986; RempelClower et al., 1996; Kapur and Brooks, 1999; Bayley et al., 2003; Kirwan et al., 2008). The
opposite pattern was observed when cortical structures like the PFC sustained damage remote memories were lost (retrograde amnesia), while recent memory was unaffected

(Markowitsch et al., 1993; Mangels et al., 1996; Reed and Squire, 1998; Murre et al., 2001;
Bayley et al., 2003, 2005; Squire and Bayley, 2007; Squire and Wixted, 2011).

The theory of systems consolidation (SC) proposes a mechanism for these findings,
arguing that as memories becomes older, or more remote, they become less HPC-dependent,
and more dependent on the PFC (Ribot, 1882; Squire, 1992; Lechner et al., 1999; Frankland et
al., 2004; Wiltgen et al., 2004; Frankland and Bontempi, 2005; Nadel et al., 2007; Squire and
Bayley, 2007; Squire et al., 2015), a process that is thought to be mediated by post-learning
spontaneous engram reactivation during sleep (Hebb, 1949; Marr, 1971; Skaggs and
McNaughton, 1996; Redish and Touretzky, 1998; Mölle et al., 2006; de Sousa et al., 2019). As
this transition occurs, it is hypothesized that memories lose many of their rich contextual details
(Tse et al., 2007; Kitamura et al., 2017). In accordance with this, retrieval of a memory shortly
after an experience involves reactivation of HPC engram cells whereas retrieval occurring later
involves reactivation of PFC engram cells (Maviel et al., 2004; Wiltgen et al., 2004, 2010; Ross
and Eichenbaum, 2006; Gonzalez et al., 2013; Doron and Goshen, 2018). However, several
observations challenge this model, such as the qualitative observation that people often retrieve
remote memories that are vivid and highly detailed (Bonnici et al., 2012). Likewise, several
studies have shown that there is activity in both structures during both recent and remote
memory recall (Piolino et al., 2004; Goshen et al., 2011; Bonnici et al., 2012; Bonaccorsi et al.,
2013; Lux et al., 2016) and that damage to the HPC sometimes affects remote memory as well
as recent memory (Shimizu et al., 2000; Debiec et al., 2002; Broadbent et al., 2006; Teixeira et
al., 2006; Kirwan et al., 2008; Sutherland et al., 2008; Irish et al., 2010; Zelikowsky et al., 2012).

Multiple trace theory (MTT), an alternative to the standard model of SC, accounts for
these findings arguing that irrespective of when they are acquired, vivid autobiographical
memories always engage the HPC (Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997; Nadel et al., 2000;
Grella et al.,

Rosenbaum et al., 2001; Gilboa et al., 2004; Meeter and Murre, 2004; Moscovitch et al., 2005;
Rekkas and Constable, 2005). Here, remote memories retain rich contextual detail (Suzuki and
Naya, 2011) as long as the trace in the HPC is dominant at the time of retrieval. However, there
is evidence to suggest that engrams are in fact, encoded in parallel across both brain regions
(Kirchhoff et al., 2000; Blumenfeld and Ranganath, 2007; Qin et al., 2007; Goshen et al., 2011;
Lesburgueres et al., 2011; Tayler et al., 2013) and that the architecture of memory traces
formed during encoding are sparse but distributed (Rao-Ruiz et al., 2019; Roy et al., 2019)
supporting a third, more flexible model, competitive trace theory (CTT). CTT suggests that
multiple traces exist (e.g., HPC and PFC) and that memories do become more schematized or
decontextualized over time and more reliant on neocortical storage but that the HPC can
function to recontextualize memories, at any time, even at remote time points (Yassa and
Reagh, 2013).

The temporal separation between recent and remote memories is ambiguous (Doron
and Goshen, 2018). In the case of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) these lines may be
even more blurred given that sometimes trauma-related memories can be recalled with vivid
detail many years after the traumatic event (Wagenaar and Groeneweg, 1990; Schelach and
Nachson, 2001; Vermetten and Bremner, 2003; Rubin et al., 2004, 2011; Berntsen and
Thomsen, 2005; Janssen et al., 2011; Fernández-Lansac and Crespo, 2017) which may be
related to the highly arousing nature of these memories (Kensinger and Schacter, 2008; Liu and
McNally, 2017), however, there are conflicting views regarding how emotion modulates memory
in general (Rubin et al., 2008; Fernández-Lansac and Crespo, 2017). More specifically, odor
seems to be a particularly powerful contextual cue that can evoke this experience long after
memories are stabilized (Vermetten and Bremner, 2003; Arshamian et al., 2013). Odors can be
potent triggers of memories, (Daniels and Vermetten, 2016) and as such, we believe that if they

are present during encoding, they can shift the organization of arousing memories at the
systems level, to a state of HPC-dependent processing.

To analyze the modulatory role of odor in the temporal dynamics of memory
consolidation, we designed an experiment to visualize sets of engram cells at recent and remote
time points. We hypothesized that fear related memories would become more PFC dependent
and less HPC dependent with the passage of time. Secondly, we hypothesized that if we fearconditioned animals with an odor present, that this contextual element would shift the temporal
organization of that memory such that it would be less reliant on the PFC, and more so on the
HPC even at remote time points. Theoretically, if our data supports SC then inhibiting activity in
the HPC should only affect recent and not remote memory retrieval. However, if odor can shift
this organization then inactivation of HPC engram cells related to an odor-associated fear
memory will also affect retrieval at the remote time point. If our data support MTT or CTT, then
we should also see an impairment also at both time points.

Briefly, we utilized chemogenic and virus-based strategies to locate and tag cells during
the formation of a contextual fear memory in c57BL/6 wildtype mice in a doxycycline (DOX)regulated manner. The viruses used comprise an inducible and activity-dependent system in
order to control which cells are tagged and later inhibited. It is inducible because it is controlled
by DOX (a derivative of tetracycline), which when present in the animal’s diet prevents
expression of the inhibitory hM4Di DREADD and the associated fluorescent reporter eYFP, and
when absent allows for their expression. The system is activity-dependent because the
expression of these proteins is driven by the immediate early gene c-Fos promoter, often used
as a neuronal marker of activity. Mice were taken off-DOX and then fear-conditioned to tag the
cells involved. Mice were placed back on DOX and then tested for memory-recall either 1 d or
21 d later and half the mice were exposed to almond extract odor during conditioning and recall.

Upon recall, mice were given CNO to inhibit the cells active during fear conditioning. We
measured freezing levels across sessions and at the end of the experiment we quantified c-Fos
activity in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) of the HPC as well as the prelimbic cortex (PL) of the PFC.

RESULTS

Viral Transduction and Activity-Dependent Engram Labeling
Viral transduction was localized to target regions (PL and dCA1) (Figure 1A-C). Mistargeted animals were excluded from data analysis. There were no group differences in the
proportion of DAPI-labeled cells within the PL (Figure 1E&G left) and dCA1 (Figure 1D&F left).
Likewise, there were no group differences in the percentage of cells that were labeled with
eYFP during fear conditioning in the PL (Figure 1E&G right) and dCA1 (Figure 1D&F right).

Inhibiting the CA1 with DREADDs did not Impair Fear Memory Recall
To assess whether odor modulates systems consolidation of a fear memory we
employed a four-shock contextual fear conditioning protocol. Animals were initially placed in the
context without shock for 198s. Figure 2B shows that during this PRE-Shock period the mice
exhibited very low levels of freezing which was significantly elevated during the POST-Shock
period F(1, 40) = 233.179, p = 0.000 [main effect (ME) of TIME: 3-way RM ANOVA] and increased
with each successive shock F(3, 120) = 105.876, p = 0.000 (ME of SHOCK: 3-way RM ANOVA;
Figure 2C&G). ODOR did not have an effect on freezing during fear-conditioning (Figure 2B&F).
Comparable levels of freezing were observed in hM4Di-Saline animals (Post-Shock 43.43 +/3.81%. Mice were then returned to the fear-conditioning chamber either 1d (RECENT) or 21d
(REMOTE) later to assess fear memory recall. In animals that were tested for memory recall 1d
after fear-conditioning (RECENT), inhibiting cell bodies in the dCA1 transfected with DREADDs

did not have any behavioural consequences (Figure 2D) as there were no group differences or
interactions in freezing levels [between-subject (BS) effects of ODOR & VIRUS: ns; 2-way
ANOVA]. The Recall session lasted 5 minutes and all animals froze significantly less in the first
minute compared to the rest of the session F(1,95) = 5.127, p < 0.001 (ME of TIME: 3-way RM
ANOVA; Figure 2E). Animals in the hM4Di-Saline group showed similar levels of freezing to the
other groups (Total = 43.66 +/- 10.67%). In mice tested for recall at 21d (REMOTE), there was a
decline in freezing in controls (NO ODOR, eYFP) and no difference between these animals and
eYFP mice that received ODOR (Figure 2I). Surprisingly, both ODOR and NO ODOR mice that
received DREADDs demonstrated modestly higher levels of freezing (Figure 2I) although this
did not reach a level of statistical significance F(1,21) = 4.133, p = 0.055 (ME of VIRUS: 2-way
ANOVA). Similarly, when the session was divided into 1-minute bins, all mice froze significantly
less in the first minute compared to the rest of the session F(1,105) = 4.422, p = 0.002 (ME of
TIME: 3-way RM ANOVA; Figure 2J) and DREADDs animals froze significantly more F(1,105) =
14.742, p < 0.001 (ME of VIRUS: 3-way RM ANOVA; Figure 2J).

Odor Modulates the Temporal Characteristics of Systems Consolidation
c-Fos Expression during Fear Memory Recall
Ninety minutes after the Recall session all animals were perfused so that c-Fos levels in
the dCA1 and PL could be quantified. Given that inhibitory hM4Di DREADDs should
theoretically silence neurons, and thus c-Fos expression, our predictions involving c-Fos
expression are with respect to eYFP animals only. In line with SC theory, we hypothesized that
REMOTE compared to RECENT fear memory recall would be less HPC-dependent evinced by
lower c-Fos levels in the dCA1 at 21d compared to 1d and that the reverse profile would be
observed in the PL. We also hypothesized that ODOR would bias this effect such that a fear
memory associated with an odor would continue to be HPC-dependent even at the REMOTE
time point.

Dorsal Hippocampus: dCA1
Figures 3E & 3I shows that in the dCA1, odor did not change the level of c-Fos
expression at the RECENT time point as both ODOR and NO ODOR animals demonstrated
similar c-Fos levels. In agreement with SC, we found that in eYFP animals, c-Fos levels
declined at the REMOTE time point and as we predicted, specifically in the NO ODOR group
and not in the ODOR group F(1,32) = 4.173, p = 0.049 (ODOR x VIRUS interaction: 3-way
ANOVA). Post-hoc analyses showed a significant difference between the NO ODOR eYFP
groups at 1d and 21d t(11) = 3.017, p = 0.012 and between eYFP ODOR and no ODOR groups
at 21d t(11) = 2.655, p = 0.022. Figures 3B & 3E shows that in mice conditioned with ODOR,
immunoreactivity of c-Fos remained elevated even at the REMOTE time point F(1,18) = 5.656, p =
0.029 (ODOR x VIRUS interaction: 2-way ANOVA) suggesting that odor can modulate the
temporal characteristics of memory consolidation in that it can delay, or even potentially abolish
the redistribution of fear memories from the HPC to the PFC.
At the RECENT time point there were no differences between the ODOR and NO ODOR
groups F(1,14) = 0.220, p = 0.646 (2-way ANOVA). However, unexpectedly c-Fos levels were
higher in DREADDs animals compared to eYFP animals F(1,32) =15.665, p < 0.001 (ME of
VIRUS: 3-way ANOVA) and this was true at 1d F(1,18) = 11.166, p = 0.005 (ME of VIRUS: 2-way
ANOVA) and 21d F(1,18) = 6.205, p = 0.023 (ME of VIRUS: 2-way ANOVA) (Figure 3E). This
effect was even more pronounced in the NO ODOR condition at 1d q(2) = 3.974, p = 0.014 and
21d q(2) = 5.125, p = 0.002.

Prefrontal Cortex: PL
In Figures 3G & 3I, we found additional support for SC in the PL where c-Fos levels
were significantly elevated at the REMOTE compared to RECENT time point F(1,33) = 19.466, p
< 0.001 (ME of RECALL: 3-way ANOVA). As in the dCA1, c-Fos levels in the PL were higher in

DREADDs animals compared to eYFP animals at 1d but not at 21d F(1,16) = 11.585, p = 0.004
(ME of VIRUS: 2-way ANOVA).
At the REMOTE time point, c-Fos levels were equally elevated for all groups with no
effect of ODOR (Figure 3G & 3I). However, at the RECENT time point, c-Fos levels were
elevated in DREADDs animals but only in the NO ODOR group F(1,16) = 10.318, p = 0.005 (ME
of ODOR: 2-way ANOVA, Figure 3G). Post hoc tests showed a significant difference between
the NO ODOR DREADDs groups and the NO ODOR eYFP group q(2) = 5.360, p = 0.002, and
the ODOR DREADDs group q(2) =4.718, p=0.004 at the RECENT time point. This suggests that
inhibiting or perturbing the dCA1 with DREADDs during fear memory recall after 1d results in
increased activity in the PL unless an ODOR is present. This further supports our hypothesis
that ODOR can shift the temporal organization of fear memories to be less dependent on the
PFC and more dependent on the HPC.

Chemogenic Inhibition of Engram Cells Activates c-Fos in Neighbouring Non-Engram Cells

Fear Memory Encoding and Recall Overlaps
We next examined the overlap between labeled fear engram neurons (eYFP) and cells
active during the Recall session (c-Fos). We hypothesized that in the dCA1, in NO ODOR
animals, there would be higher overlap at the RECENT vs. REMOTE time point whereas in the
ODOR animals we expected to see high overlap at both time points. We hypothesized that the
opposite would be true in the PL with higher overlap at the REMOTE vs. RECENT time point
and that ODOR would decrease this overlap. Again, our predictions involving overlap are with
respect to eYFP animals only taking into consideration that we used inhibitory DREADDs to
silence neurons. However, given that DREADDs in this experiment, increased c-Fos
expression, we also looked at overlap in the DREADDs groups to assess whether we could

glean insight to the increased levels of freezing seen at the REMOTE time point in these
animals.

Dorsal Hippocampus: dCA1
In the dCA1, exhibited by a significant ODOR x RECALL interaction F(1,19) = 5.486, p =
0.03 (2-way ANOVA), in accordance with our hypothesis, we found that within the NO ODOR
eYFP condition there was a higher degree of overlap between the cells active during fearconditioning and recall at the RECENT time point compared to the REMOTE time point t(11) =
3.404, p = 0.006. This is in contrast to the ODOR eYFP condition where overlap was elevated at
both time points (Figure 3F). A Mann-Whitney test indicated that overlap was greater in the
ODOR group (Mdn = 1.057) compared to the NO ODOR group (Mdn = 0.262) at the REMOTE
time point (U = 3, p = 0.008). Moreover, both ODOR and NO ODOR eYFP groups had higher
than chance levels of overlap at the RECENT time point q(2) = 4.03, p = 0.008 as well the ODOR
eYFP group at the REMOTE time point q(2) = 6.417, p < 0.001) (Figure 3F). For animals that
received DREADDs, there were no differences in overlap across time points, and while the
percentage of overlap was similar to eYFP animals, contrastingly, the percentage of overlap did
not differ from chance as it did in the eYFP mice (Figure 3F) except for the ODOR group at the
RECENT time point q(2) = 3.861, p = 0.01. In the NO OODR animals, overlap here was greater
in the DREADDs group compared to the eYFP group at the REMOTE time point q(2) = 3.186, p
= 0.037. This pattern suggests that c-Fos levels were increased in neighbouring non-engram
cells (Figure 3K left).

Prefrontal Cortex: PL
In the PL, a three-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of RECALL F(1,33) =
6.808, p = 0.014 and a significant main effect of ODOR F(1,33) = 6.787, p = 0.014 as well as a
significant ODOR x VIRUS interaction F(1,33) = 4.382, p = 0.044. Specifically within the eYFP

animals using a two-way ANOVA, there was a significant main effect of RECALL F(1,19) = 4.697,
p = 0.043 and a significant main effect of ODOR F(1,19) = 9.874, p = 0.005 but no interaction
signaling that ODOR decreased overlap to chance (only eYFP NO ODOR groups differed from

ns) at both time points (Figure 3H). This suggests that odor-associated memories are not
processed in the PL or at least suggests that this is the case when recall occurs in the presence
of the same odor that was present at the time of encoding. Post-hoc analyses revealed that this
is certainly true at the RECENT time point q(2) = 3.15, p = 0.033 specifically for eYFP animals q(2)
= 4.414, p = 0.007. However, due to high levels of variability in the NO ODOR group this effect
was not observed at the REMOTE time point q(2) = 2.08, p = 0.151 (Figure 3H). A two-way
ANOVA across ODOR and VIRUS at the REMOTE time point revealed a significant difference
between the ODOR and NO ODOR groups in the eYFP condition q(2) = 3.937, p = 0.013. It
remains unknown whether overlap would still be low if encoding had been carried out in the
presence of an odor as was the case in the current experiment, but the recall test had been
conducted in the absence of odor.

Given that c-Fos levels were higher in the dCA1 in DREADDs animals compared to
eYFP animals t(14) = -4.112, p = 0.001 (Figure 3B) but that overlap was higher in the eYFP
animals compared to the DREADDs animals at the RECENT time point F(1, 14) = 4.539, p =
0.051, 2-way ANOVA) and the REMOTE time point F(1,18) = 4.563, p = 0.047 (ODOR x VIRUS
interaction, 2-way ANOVA), this suggests that in the dCA1, DREADDs increased c-Fos and not
necessarily in fear memory neuronal ensembles (Figure 3K) and may be primarily increasing
activity in neighboring neurons in a compensatory manner. We ran an additional control
experiment without odor at the RECENT time point. We included a group (hM4Di Saline) that
was injected with the hM4Di virus in the dCA1 (as well as the eYFP virus in the PL), however,
these animals received saline instead of CNO. We compared c-Fos levels in these animals to

mice that were given CNO as well as injected with the hM4Di virus (hM4Di CNO) or the eYFP
virus (eYFP CNO), in the dCA1 (as well as the eYFP virus in the PL). Saline injections resulted
in comparable expression of c-Fos in the dCA1 to eYFP animals (F(2,13) = 5.753, p = 0.019, oneway ANOVA) (Figure 3J, top left). When we look at overlaps compared to chance we see that
the increases c-Fos occur within dCA1 engram cells for the eYFP-CNO (t(3) = 3.910, p = 0.011)
and hM4Di-Saline animals (t(3) = -3.535, p = 0.039), but not for hM4Di-CNO animals where cFos is increased in non-engram cell populations (Figure 3J, bottom left) suggesting that
chemogenetically silencing the neurons involved in fear memory encoding during recall 1d later,
can result in increased c-Fos activity in non-engram hippocampal cells.

Interestingly, c-Fos levels were also increased in the PL in DREADDs animals, with the
exception of the ODOR group at the RECENT time point (Figure 3G). However, overlap was
only elevated above chance for the NO ODOR groups at both RECENT and REMOTE time
points suggesting that even in the PL, DREADDs seem to be increasing c-Fos in a
compensatory manner following inhibition of dCA1 engram cells, and not in PL engram cells
(Figure 3K). Moreover, when we looked at c-Fos levels in the PL in the control animals that had
received saline instead of CNO, we found that they were also significantly lower than hM4DiCNO animals demonstrating that inhibiting fear memory engram cells can cause an increase in
activity in the PL (F(2,13) = 4.84, p = 0.031, one-way ANOVA) (Figure 3J, top right). When we
look at overlaps compared to chance we see that the increases c-Fos occur within PL engram
cells for the eYFP-CNO (t(5) = -6.263, p = 0.002) and hM4Di-Saline animals (t(3) = -7.903, p =
0.004), but not for hM4Di-CNO animals where c-Fos is increased in non-engram cell
populations (Figure 3J, bottom right).

We ran bivariate correlational analyses between freezing levels during the Recall
session and c-Fos expression as well as Overlap in the dCA1 and in the PL. In NO ODOR
eYFP animals we found that freezing was correlated with c-Fos (r = 0.729, n = 11, p=0.011, 2tailed) and Overlap (r = 0.612, n = 11, p = 0.046, 2-tailed) in the dCA1 (Figures 4A-B) and
negatively correlated with c-Fos in the PL (r = -0.647, n = 9, p=0.032, 2-tailed) (Figures 4C-D).
When this was parsed across time, we saw no significant correlations. These animals showed a
decrease in freezing across time and also a decrease in c-Fos levels in the dCA1 as well as an
increase in c-Fos in the PL. In NO ODOR DREADDs animals, freezing during Recall did not
correlate with c-Fos or Overlap in either brain region. In ODOR animals, we saw no significant
correlations in eYFP or DREADDs animals and when we looked specifically at the groups that
demonstrated increased freezing at the REMOTE time point, their freezing levels were not
correlated with c-Fos or Overlap in either the dCA1 or the PL. This suggests that there is a
dissociation between these measures and freezing as a behavioral output, specifically in
animals that received DREADDs and therefore, the increases in c-Fos observed in this
condition are not likely related to the increased freezing observed at the REMOTE time point.
However, it is possible that there was a ceiling effect on freezing reached here and these cells
which are now c-Fos+ due to DREADD inhibition are conceivably contributing to freezing.

DISCUSSION

As the French author Marcel Proust described long ago (Proust, 1927), referenced in his
work A la Recherche du Temps Perdu which translates to In Search of Lost Time - “Yet a single
scent already breathed long ago, may once again both be in the present and the past, be real
without being present”. Sensory experiences like olfaction and gustation have the ability to
produce the evocation of vivid autobiographical memories of the distant past (Toffolo et al.,
Grella et al., 14

2012; Zucco et al., 2012; Daniels and Vermetten, 2016; Glachet and El Haj, 2019). This
spontaneous process which we have all experienced at one time or another is often referred to
as the Proust Phenomenon. Few studies have tried to unravel this phenomenon systematically.
For most, this reverie can be a pleasant trip through time but for individuals with PTSD, odors
can serve as triggers for extremely aversive experiences (Toffolo et al., 2012). The vivid nature
of these experiences can make them all the more painful.

In this study we sought to determine whether odor as a contextual cue, associated with a
fear-related memory, could shift the temporal dynamics of the consolidation of that memory at
the systems level. To assess this, we fear conditioned animals using a four-shock protocol
either with or without almond odor present within the training context. We observed increased
freezing during training with each successive shock and that odor did not affect the overall
learning curves. The lack of group differences during conditioning also suggests that there were
no intrinsic effects of the hM4Di virus in the absence of CNO. We then replicated previous work
showing that with the passage of time, fear memories are processed to a lesser extent within
the HPC and rely on neocortical storage (Teixeira et al., 2006; Lesburgueres et al., 2011; Silva
et al., 2018; DeNardo et al., 2019). When fear memory recall following conditioning was tested
after 1 d, we observed a more pronounced recruitment of cellular activity compared to the PL. In
contrast, when tested after 21 d, we detected increased activity in the PL compared to the
dCA1. These data support SC in that episodic-like memory retrieval recruits cortical structures
such as the PL at remote compared to recent time points, whereas the HPC is important for
initial memory storage (Frankland and Bontempi, 2005).

Fear conditioning has been widely used as a model for PTSD in rodent studies
(Rasmusson and Charney, 1997; Morrison and Ressler, 2014; Bali and Jaggi, 2015), and fear
memories are encoded as engrams across multiple brain regions (Josselyn et al., 2015) and
Grella et al., 15

activation of these engrams has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to drive fear
responses. However, while the foundation for cortical traces are laid down early during encoding
(Lesburgueres et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012; Cardenas et al., 2019; Corches et al., 2019;
Jacques et al., 2019) there is evidence to suggest that the PFC neurons involved in fear
memory retrieval are not the same neurons active during encoding (Giannotti et al., 2019;
DeNardo et al., 2019). Within the PFC, we specifically looked at the PL for several reasons. In
humans, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been shown to be hyperactive in
response to fearful stimuli in individuals with PTSD (Milad et al., 2007) and comparatively in
rodents the anatomic equivalent of the ACC is the PL (Choi et al., 2010; Laubach et al., 2018).
In rodent studies, the PL has been implicated in the expression and renewal of fear responses
(Corcoran and Quirk, 2007; Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011; Orsini and Maren, 2012; Courtin et al.,
2014; Fenton et al., 2014; Corches et al., 2019) and increased activity in this region is
associated with extinction deficits (Burgos-Robles et al., 2009) as well as increased input to the
basolateral amygdala (BLA) (Likhtik et al., 2005; Maren et al., 2013), an output which promotes
freezing behavior and fear (Vidal-Gonzalez et al., 2006).

We tested whether presenting an odor during fear conditioning, and then again during
retrieval, would alter the dynamics of consolidation in a way that engaged the HPC for a longer
period of time (e.g. high intensity training has been shown to have the opposite effect, speeding
up the decay of HPC dependency promoting memory generalization; Pedraza et al., 2017). We
found that odor influenced this temporal relationship biasing the memory system away from the
PFC and towards the HPC, suggesting that retrieval of highly contextual experiences does
require the HPC even at remote time points. When recall was tested after 1 d, c-Fos levels were
equally elevated in dCA1 in both odor and no-odor groups. However, when we looked at recall
at 21 d, these levels declined in the no-odor group but not in the odor animals. Overlaps were
also higher and statistically above chance, in the dCA1 at the recent time point for both odor

and no odor groups and at the remote time point when odor was present, suggesting that odor
can mediate how fear memories are organized.

The present study did not include a group that was exposed to odor during encoding but
not during retrieval, opening up the possibility for future experiments to test whether odor as a
function of memory possesses the ability to delay translocation of the fear memory trace to the
PFC, or if odor presented at the time of retrieval re-contextualizes the memory activating the
HPC as a result. This data would provide insight to the nuances within the existing debate
regarding theories of consolidation: is the HPC always engaged when processing a highly
contextual memory (they decontextualize slower) as purported by MTT? Or are these memories
equally subject to context generalization, schematization, and decontextualization but given the
ideal cue to evoke recall can become recontextualized thereby stimulating the HPC? Future
experiments may also include a group that tests this as well measurements linking c-Fos
expression to context generalization (Wiltgen and Silva, 2007). To further support the
modulatory role of odor on systems consolidation, we showed that when odor was present,
overlaps within the PL decreased to chance levels at both time points, suggesting that odorassociated memories recruit different neurons from encoding to retrieval. It would also be
interesting to measure whether overlaps would remain at chance levels if odor had been
presented during encoding but not retrieval, as there is a possibility that the PL processes the
odor as a new cue reverting the system back to encoding, despite the observed bias for odor to
be processed in the HPC.

Olfaction is a unique sensory modality in that it is the only sense that bypasses the
thalamus sending projections directly to the forebrain (Shepherd, 2005). Olfactory input is a
highly salient sensory cue in both rodents and humans, and guides many different types of
behavior from maternal bonding and reproduction, to social hierarchy, foraging, and the

detection of pathogens (Doty, 1986; Kesslak et al., 1988; Edwards et al., 1990; Fleming et al.,
1999; Li et al., 2007; Lübke and Pause, 2014; Takahashi et al., 2018). Qualitatively, this may
explain why odor as a contextual cue possesses seemingly time-travelling characteristics,
(Tulving, 2002) where one whiff of your mother’s favorite perfume can bring you back to your
childhood in an instant. Odor is tightly interconnected with memory. The dentate gyrus (DG) of
the HPC is important for keeping highly similar memories and experiences separate, a function
called pattern separation (Sahay et al., 2011). It has been shown that the ventral DG plays an
important role in olfactory learning and memory, and specifically in odor discrimination (Weeden
et al., 2014) which may help elucidate how odor-related memories are so resistant to
interference. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that individuals with memory disorders
such as Alzheimer’s disease experience deficits in processing olfactory memory (Kesslak et al.,
1988), potentially due to its reliance on the HPC.

Finally, we assessed whether inhibiting the tagged cellular ensembles in the dCA1 using
DREADDs would decrease freezing. Given the upregulation of the HPC at the recent time point
compared to the remote time point we hypothesized that inhibiting this region would affect
memory recall only at 1 d and not at 21 d. In eYFP controls, we demonstrated that odor
promotes hippocampal involvement during remote memory recall, therefore, we also
hypothesized that inhibiting the dCA1 would impair memory at the remote time point if the
memory was associated with an odor. Behaviorally, we saw no effect of inhibiting the dCA1 with
CNO on recall at 1 d and unexpectedly there was an increase in freezing at 21 d. The
incubation of fear hypothesis originally proposed by Hans Eysenck (Eysenck, 1968) states that
repeated exposure to an unreinforced conditioned stimulus (i.e., the training context) following
acquisition of a classical aversive conditioned response (i.e., freezing) provided that the
conditioned stimulus (i.e., the shock) is a strong stimulus, will serve to enhance the conditioned
response over time (Richards and Martin, 1990). In previous rodent studies, which have

examined fear memory recall across recent and remote time points, fear responses related to
the training context tended to either stay stable (Wiltgen and Silva, 2007; Poulos et al., 2016) or
strengthen over time (Houston et al., 1999; Balogh et al., 2002; Frankland et al., 2004; Poulos et
al., 2016) supporting Eysenck’s hypothesis. However, there have also been human studies
where this effect was not observed (Richards and Martin, 1990), and in the current study we
saw a decline in freezing over time. While we did not test fear generalization, it is possible that
this decline in the conditioned response was accompanied by an increase in generalization
(Wiltgen and Silva, 2007). If our animals had not shown this decrease, we speculate that the
behavioral differences between eYFP and DREADDs animals at the remote time point would
not have been observed. The majority of studies reporting incubation of fear looked at recall
between 28-36 days later (Balogh et al., 2002; Frankland et al., 2004; Wiltgen and Silva, 2007;
Poulos et al., 2016; Germer et al., 2019) with one study (Siegmund and Wotjak, 2007) claiming
maximal fear expression occurred at 28 days, whereas we tested our mice at 21 days which
may not be long enough for an effect of fear incubation to emerge. Interestingly, Houston et al.,
(1999) found that fear incubation is less pronounced in older rats (27 months). Together, the
conclusions from our behavioural data should be tempered nonetheless, chemogenic inhibition
of dCA1 engram cells using DREADDs did not decrease freezing at either time point.

Unexpectedly, we also saw high levels of c-Fos expression in all groups that received
DREADDs in the dCA1. Theoretically, these neurons should effectively be silenced and show
very little, if any c-Fos expression. DREADDs are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that
have been genetically engineered to allow minimal constitutive activity when they are introduced
by viral-mediated gene transfer directly into the brain, thus behavior in the animal is not affected
by their presence (Pei et al., 2008). DREADDs do not have endogenous ligands as they are
activated only by the synthetic ligand, CNO, an inert compound that does not induce any other
activity in the rodent brain aside from binding to these designer GPCRs (Pei et al., 2008). The

inhibitory DREADDs construct that we used contained the gene hM4Di (Gi) which originated
from the human muscarinic receptor where induced point mutations allow inefficacy of the
endogenous ligand acetylcholine, and efficacy of CNO, where activation of hM4Di receptors can
inhibit neurons in a reversible manner (Armbruster et al., 2007). Confirmed using extracellular in
vivo recordings measured 30 min later, CNO administered at 5mg/kg was able to inhibit
neuronal firing rates in c-Fos-tTA transgenic mice injected with an AAV virus carrying the hM4Di
gene under the control of the hSyn1 promoter (Ryan et al., 2015). Following this time frame, as
DREADDs are reversible, firing rates rebounded back to steady state. Several other
electrophysiology studies have produced similar findings (Armbruster et al., 2007; Ferguson et
al., 2011; Parnaudeau et al., 2013; Sano et al., 2014). For the most part, other studies which
have established the inhibitory nature of this gene have tested whether CNO sufficiently
hyperpolarizes neurons in slice preparations with a CNO bath-application onto cultured
hippocampal cells in vitro. The degree to which CNO can hyperpolarize the cell has been shown
to be dose dependent (Zhu et al., 2014). It is possible that the dose we chose (3mg/kg) was too
low to observe behavioral effects, and potentially our dose was not sufficient to cross the
threshold of decreased firing to silence neurons but resulted in “quieting” neurons rather than
shutting them off completely. However, many other studies that have reported observable
effects employed lower doses (1mg/kg) (Andero et al., 2014; Mahler et al., 2014; Sweeney and
Yang, 2015; Parfitt et al., 2017; Chiang et al., 2018).

We have explored several possible explanations for our DREADD results. The most
parsimonious is that CNO itself produced a cellular perturbation that did not fully manifest into a
behavioral readout. Thus, although we failed to see a behavioral effect, we nevertheless
observed alterations in c-Fos expression. It is also possible that our virus targeted interneurons
and therefore rather than silencing excitatory pyramidal cells in the dCA1, we disinhibited
inhibitory interneurons causing an increase in activity. Theoretically, this fits with our behavioral

results since further increases in activity in the dCA1 would not have contributed to further
freezing, as a ceiling effect was potentially reached. In contrast, in c-Fos-tTA transgenic mice
(Reijmers et al., 2007) transduced with the DOX-regulated AAV9-TRE-ChR2-eYFP virus,
engram labeling was restricted to excitatory neurons, as no overlap was detected somatically
between ChR2 positive cells and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) positive cells (Liu
et al., 2012). To date, no assessment of the kinetics of CNO based neural inactivation has been
conducted in wildtype animals that have been injected with the c-Fos-tTA-TRE-hM4Di-eYFP
virus, although in a recent paper our group too observed similar results of c-Fos expression in
the BLA (Chen et al., 2019).

One of the striking differences between the DREADDs system we used and what has
been used in the majority of other studies is that our system is a tet-off system where hM4Di is
only expressed in a subset of cells transduced (~20%). Targeted cells specifically consist of the
fear engram cells active during tagging / encoding and not all of the neurons in that particular
brain region. In a recent paper, using c-Fos-tTA transgenic mice injected with a DOX-regulated
TRE-ArchT-GFP virus to optogenetically silence cocaine-place engram neurons in the dCA1,
light delivery led to inhibition in the targeted neurons accompanied by the simultaneous
emergence of non-targeted, alternative neurons in the vicinity. They found that their
manipulation caused a disengagement from initially recruited cells (during encoding) and the
activation of an alternative spatial map (Trouche et al., 2016). Although this study was
conducted using optogenetics, it is possible that silencing engram cells in the dCA1 resulted in
the recruitment of adjacent non-engram cells. This would explain how c-Fos were elevated, but
overlaps were not statistically above chance, following CNO injections in hM4Di mice.
Furthermore, promoter-dependent differential hM4Di virus expression has been observed
(Lopez et al., 2016).

Grella et al., 21

It is not surprising that we would see these compensatory, off-target effects following
acute perturbation of the steady state internal dynamics of the brain possibly interfering with the
excitatory-inhibitory balance in the dCA1 (Otchy et al., 2015). This is colloquially known as the
“whack a mole” effect, once you hit a mole another one pops up. In this case silencing a neuron
is like hitting a mole. We also saw an increase in c-Fos in the PL following inhibition in the
dCA1. This was observed in all groups except the group tested after 1 d that was exposed to
odor. Again, given the complex excitatory-inhibitory feedback networks within the HPC and
between the HPC and the PFC, inhibition or perturbation in the dCA1 with DREADDs would not
necessarily result in a decrease in firing in the PL (Schmidt et al., 2019). Schmidt et al., (2019)
found that some neurons increased, and some neurons decreased their firing rate following
CNO injection in mice transfected with the hM4Di gene in the PFC under the CAMKIIa
promoter. Interestingly, in the current study, perturbing the dCA1 at the recent time point
redirected processing during memory retrieval to the PL in the no-odor group but not the odor
group. This further supports our hypotheses and suggests that to some degree odor-associated
fear memories are less malleable in the sense that they require the HPC for processing. We
believe that, together, this presents a putative new target for PTSD research. Current
therapeutic interventions often involve exposure therapy, and reactivating a previously
consolidated, odor-associated fear memory in the presence of the associated odor may bias the
memory system allocating the trace to the HPC for processing. Theoretically, this may help
focus intervention strategies to a particular locus or node in the brain that can be combined with
other treatments. Additionally, future studies may involve intersectional analysis involving this
theory and the use of optogenetics.

Previous research has demonstrated a connection between the expression of excitatory
DREADDs and c-Fos (Garner et al., 2012; Roy et al., 2019). To assess whether there was a link
between increases in c-Fos expression observed following inhibition of the dCA1 with
Grella et al., 22

DREADDs and our behavioral data where we saw an increase in freezing in animals that
received CNO at the remote time point, we ran a correlational analysis. Several studies have
shown a positive correlation between conditioned freezing and c-Fos expression in the HPC
(Radulovic et al., 1998; Strekalova et al., 2003; Knapska and Maren, 2009), however, some
studies have shown a dissociation (Singewald, 2007; Plendl and Wotjak, 2010; Mastrodonato et
al., 2018). We only found significant correlations in our eYFP no odor group where conditioned
freezing was positively correlated with c-Fos levels and the percentage of overlap in the dCA1
and negatively correlated with c-Fos expression in the PL. Since we found no correlations
between these measures in the DREADDs groups, the increase in freezing that we saw in the
DREADDs mice at the remote time point cannot be attributed to the increased c-Fos expression
seen in these mice in the dCA1 and in the PL following CNO administration. Moreover, the time
interval between CNO injection and perfusion was 120 minutes, and it remains possible that by
this time c-Fos levels started to rebound following neuronal inhibition and that we would have
seen lower c-Fos levels and significant correlations if we had sacrificed the animals slightly
earlier.

In summary, our histological results provide insight into the molecular dynamics related
to activity-dependent, DOX-regulated inhibitory DREADDs, while also demonstrating plasticity in
the process of memory consolidation at the systems level whereby even remote memories are
amenable to modulation by contextual cues such as odor. A better understanding of how
memories are layered, comprised of contextual information at the level of the engram localized
to specific brain regions (Vetere et al., 2019) may provide therapeutic insight to the convergence
of emotional processing and PTSD symptomology (Daniels and Vermetten, 2016).

Animals
51 wild type male c57BL/6 mice (2-3 months of age; Charles River Labs, Wilmington, MA)
weighing 18-25g at the time of arrival were housed in groups of 2-5 mice per cage. Mice were
kept on a regular light cycle 12:12 hour light/dark in a temperature and humidity-controlled
colony room. Cages were changed once a week and contained cardboard huts and nesting
material for enrichment. Upon arrival in the facility, mice were placed on a 40 mg/kg doxycycline
(DOX) diet (Bio-Serv, product F4159, Lot 226766) and left undisturbed for a minimum of 3 days
prior to surgery with access to food and water ad libitum. They were then handled for two
consecutive days for 2 minutes each day. The following day they underwent surgery. All
subjects were treated in accordance with protocol 17-008 approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at Boston University. The behavioural results reported are based on
data from a total of 51 experimental animals. Due to a loss of tissue histological data reported is
based on 44 animals for CA1 and 45 animals for PL.

Stereotaxic Surgery and Virus Microinjections
Aseptic surgeries were carried out with mice mounted into a stereotaxic frame (Kopf
Instruments, Tujunga, CA) with skull flat. They were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and 70%
oxygen for induction with isoflurane at 2% to maintain anesthesia during surgery. A small
amount of 2% lidocaine (Clipper Distributing Company, St. Joseph, MO) was placed on the skull
as a topical analgesic and a small hole was drilled above each injection site. Animals received
four microinjections, bilateral injections into the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) (Fig 1A-B) and the prelimbic
cortex (PL) (Fig 1A, C) via a 10ul gas-tight Hamilton syringe attached to a micro-infusion pump
(UMP3, World Precision Instruments, Florida, USA) which occurred at a rate of 100 nl min-1.
Coordinates are given relative to Bregma (in mm). All mice were injected bilaterally in the PL
and the dCA1. In the PL, mice were injected with a viral cocktail of AAV9-cFos-tTa (titre:
1E+13GC/mL) and TRE-eYFP (titre: 3E+13GC/mL) in a volume of 400 nl/side at AP: +1.9, ML:

+/- 0.3, DV: -1.9. The dCA1 was targeted at AP: -2.0, ML: +/- 1.5, DV: -1.2, with mice receiving
a cocktail of AAV9-cFos-tTa and either TRE-hM4Di-eYFP (titre: 2.5E+13GC/mL) (DREADDs) or
TRE-eYFP (eYFP) in a volume of 550 nl/side. Injectors were left in place for 1 minute following
each injection to avoid liquid backflow. Mice were then sutured, received 0.2ml physiological
sterile saline (0.9%, s.c.) and 0.1 mL of a 0.03 mg/ml buprenorphine solution (i.p.) at the end of
the surgery, and were placed on a heating pad and given hydrogel. Mice were given an
additional injection buprenorphine (0.1 mL, 0.03 mg/ml, i.p.) the next day. Except for cage
changes, having their tails were marked with a skin marker every 24-48 hours, and being
weighed, mice were left undisturbed for a ten-day period following surgery to allow for recovery
and virus expression.

Behavioral Testing: Fear Conditioning and Recall
Mice were habituated to 2%DMSO injections in sterile saline (0.9%, i.p) 3 days prior to fear
conditioning. DOX diet was replaced with standard rodent chow (ad libitum) 42 hours prior to
behavioral tagging. Half of the animals were fear conditioned in the presence of almond extractsoaked gauze in a plastic container with holes (ODOR) in the conditioning chambers (Colbourn,
Whitehall, PA) while the other half were just given the tubes without the odor (NO ODOR). The
fear conditioning session lasted 500 seconds. Mice received four shocks during this session: 1st
shock at 198s, 2nd at 280s, 3rd at 360s, and 4th at 440s (Costanzi et al., 2014; Redondo et al.,
2014) (2s duration, 1.5 mA intensity). At the end of the session, mice were placed back on DOX
(ad libitum) and placed in a holding tank until all cage mates had been fear-conditioned and
then all mice were placed back with cage mates in a clean home cage. Mice were returned to
the original fear-conditioning context for a Recall session either 1 day (RECENT) or 21 days
later (REMOTE) with the same odor conditions they received during conditioning. Thirty minutes
prior to the recall session, all mice were injected with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) and 90 minutes
after the recall session mice were euthanized. We also included a control group that was tested

at the RECENT time point with NO ODOR, however these mice were given saline injections
(0.9%, i.p.) instead of CNO (n=4). Each conditioning chamber had a camera mounted on the
roof for video recording. Video was fed into a computer running Freeze Frame / View software
(Coulbourn Instruments) where freezing was defined as a bout of immobility lasting 1.25
seconds or longer.

Drugs: Use of Clozapine-N-Oxide
Half of the animals were injected with an inhibitory DREADDs virus (hM4Di) fused to an eYFP
reporter while the other half were given just eYFP. To inhibit neuronal firing (Pei et al., 2008;
Dong et al., 2010; Ferguson et al., 2011; Zhu and Roth, 2015; Roth, 2016) in cells transfected
with DREADDs (Mahler et al., 2014; Zhu and Roth, 2015), all mice (except for the saline control
group) were injected with CNO, obtained from NIH: NIDA Drug Supply Program (NIMH C-929;
batch ID: 14073-1) and prepared in a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml in sterile saline (0.9%) and 2%
DMSO. Thirty minutes prior to the Recall session this was administered i.p. at a dose of 3
mg/kg.

Immunohistochemistry
Mice were overdosed with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with (4° C) phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were extracted and stored
overnight in PFA at 4°C and transferred to PBS solution the following day. Brains were sliced
into 50μm coronal sections with a vibratome (Leica, VT100S) and collected in cold PBS.
Sections were blocked for 2 hrs at room temperature in 1x phosphate-buffered saline + 2%
Triton (PBS-T) and 5% normal goat serum (NGS) on a shaker. Sections were transferred to well
plates containing primary antibodies made in PBS-T (1:1000 rabbit anti-c-Fos [SySy]; 1:5000
chicken anti-GFP [Invitrogen]) and incubated on a shaker at 4°C for 48 hrs. Sections were then
washed in PBS-T for 10 min (x3), followed by 2 hr incubation with secondary antibody (1:200

Alexa 555 anti-rabbit [Invitrogen]; 1:200 Alexa 488 anti-chicken [Invitrogen] made in PBS-T).
Following three additional 10 min washes in PBS-T, sections were mounted onto micro slides
(VWR International, LCC). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI added to Vectashield HardSet
Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc), slides were then cover-slipped and put in the
fridge overnight. The following day the edges were sealed with clear nail-polish and the slides
were stored in a slide box in the fridge until imaging.

Fluorescent Confocal Image Acquisition & Analysis
Images were collected from coronal sections a fluorescent confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 800
with airyscan) at 20X magnification. For each animal, in the PL, 2-3 z-stacks (step size 0.94um)
were taken per hemisphere from 2-3 different slices yielding 4-6 total z-stacks per animal. In the
dCA1, z-stacks (step size 0.94um) were obtained from both hemispheres from 3-4 different
slices. Per slice two stacks were taken in the left hemisphere, one in the dorsomedial CA1 and
one in the dorsolateral CA1. The values for these were summed. Two images were also taken
in the right hemisphere, and these also summed. Data from each hemisphere was then pooled
and the mean for the total 6-8 z-stacks were computed. The total number of DAPI positive (+)
neurons were counted using Image J / Fiji (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). In addition, the number of
eYFP+ (cells tagged during fear conditioning), c-Fos+ (cells active at the time of fear memory
recall), and eYFP+ and c-Fos+ (cells active in both behavioral epochs) neurons in the dCA1 and
PL were quantified to measure the number of active cells during defined behavioral tasks.
Percentage of immunoreactive neurons was defined as a proportion of total DAPI labeled cells.
Chance overlap was calculated as the percentage of eYFP+ neurons multiplied by the
percentage of c-Fos+ neurons over the total number of DAPI neurons.

Statistical Analysis
Calculated statistics are presented as means ±SEM. To analyze differences, we used

three-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) [RECALL (between-subject factor - two levels:
RECENT & REMOTE time points) x ODOR (between-subject factor – two levels: ODOR & NO
ODOR) x VIRUS (between-subject factor – two levels: eYFP & DREADDS)]. When appropriate,
follow-up comparisons (two-way ANOVAs, independent T-tests) and post-hoc analyses
(Tukey’s HSD, or Mann-Whitney) were conducted. When Fear Conditioning and Recall sessions
were divided into bins, these data were analyzed using Repeated Measures (RM) three-way
ANOVAs [ODOR (between-subject factor - two levels: ODOR & NO ODOR) x VIRUS (betweensubject factor – two levels: eYFP & DREADDS) x TIME (within-subject factor – two levels: PRE
& POST Shock / or five levels: MINUTES 1-5) or x SHOCK (within-subject factor – four levels:
SHOCK 1-4). Comparisons between the percentage of overlap against chance were also
conducted using three-way RM ANOVAs [ODOR (between-subject factor - two levels: ODOR &
NO ODOR) x VIRUS (between-subject factor – two levels: eYFP & DREADDS) x CHANCE
(within-subject factor – two levels: OVERLAP & CHANCE). Bivariate correlational analyses
were performed using Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient. All statistical tests assumed an alpha
level of 0.05. For all figures, * = p< 0.05, ** = p<0.01, *** = p<0.001.

Figure 2. Inhibiting the CA1 with DREADDs did not Impair Fear Memory Recall. To assess
whether odor modulates systems consolidation of a fear memory we employed a four-shock
contextual fear conditioning (FC) protocol where animals were tested either in the presence of
odor or no odor and tested for recall 1d (Recent) or 21d (Remote) later. (A) Timeline of our
behavioral experiment for animals tested at 1d. (B) Animals were initially placed in context A
without shock for 198s (Pre-Shock) where they exhibited very low levels of freezing which was
significantly elevated during the Post-Shock period (C) and increased with each successive
shock. (D) Mice were then returned to the FC context 1d later for a 5 min fear memory recall
test. (E) Data shown across 1 min bins. Inhibiting cell bodies in the dCA1 with DREADDs did not
have any behavioural consequences. (F) Timeline of our behavioral experiment for animals
tested at 21d. (G) Animals were initially placed in context A without shock for 198s (Pre-Shock)
where they exhibited very low levels of freezing which was significantly elevated during the
Post-Shock period (H) and increased with each successive shock. (I) Mice were then returned
to the FC context 21d later for a 5 min fear memory recall test. (J) Data shown across 1 min
bins. Inhibiting cell bodies in the dCA1 with DREADDs caused an increase in freezing in both
odor and no odor conditions. p< 0.05, ** = p<0.01, *** = p<0.001.

Figure 3. Odor Modulates the Temporal Characteristics of Systems Consolidation.
For both recall sessions (1d & 21d), the total number of DAPI positive (+), eYFP+ (cells tagged
during fear conditioning), c-Fos+ (cells active during fear memory recall), and eYFP+ and cFos+ (cells active in both behavioral epochs) neurons in the (A) dCA1 and (C) PL were
quantified. (B) In eYFP animals, in dCA1 odor did not change c-Fos expression at 1d as
predicted, c-Fos levels declined at 21 d in the no odor group but remained elevated in the odor
group. (D) In eYFP animals, in the PL, c-Fos levels were significantly higher at 21d compared to
1d. Two images per condition are provided. (E) The % of c-Fos immunoreactive neurons was
defined as a proportion of total DAPI labeled cells. In dCA1, there was a significant difference
between no odor eYFP groups at 1d and 21d and between eYFP odor and no odor groups at
21d. Unexpectedly, c-Fos levels were higher in DREADDs animals compared to eYFP animals.
(F) Overlaps were considered the proportion of DAPI labeled cells that were both c-Fos+ and
eYFP+. Chance overlap was calculated as the % of eYFP+ neurons x the % of c-Fos+ neurons
over the total number of DAPI neurons (pink line). Overlaps followed the same pattern as c-Fos.
(G) In the PL, c-Fos levels were significantly elevated at 21d compared to 1d with the exception
of the no odor group at 1d. As in dCA1, c-Fos was also higher in DREADDs animals compared
to eYFP animals at 1d but not 21d. (H) Odor decreased overlaps to chance. (I) In eYFP
animals, contextual fear memories become more reliant on the PL with time irrespective of odor.
Conversely, they become less reliant on the dCA1 with time, if no odor is present. However, if
odor is present during encoding and again upon retrieval, these memories continue to engage
the dCA1. Inhibiting dCA1 with CNO using doxycycline-regulated, c-Fos promoter driven
DREADDs introduced using an adeno-associated virus to tag fear engram cells produced an
increase in c-Fos levels. (J) In the no odor groups at 1d, DREADDs + CNO mice showed
greater numbers of c-Fos+ cells, compared to DREADDs + Saline or eYFP + CNO mice in both
the dcA1 (top left) and the PL (top right). These increases in c-Fos were predominantly seen in
non-engram cells. When we view the proportion of double-labeled cells, they occur to a

Figure 4. Freezing was Positively Correlated with c-Fos Expression and Overlap in the dCA1
and Negatively Correlated with c-Fos Expression in the PL in Controls. We ran bivariate
correlational analyses between freezing levels during the recall sessions and c-Fos expression
as well as overlap in the dCA1 and in the PL. In no odor eYFP animals we found that freezing
was correlated with (A) c-Fos and (B) overlap in the dCA1 and negatively correlated with (C) cFos in the PL. (D) There was no correlation between freezing and overlap in the PL. p< 0.05, **
