Abstract:
Introns are noncoding DNA elements found in between coding exons of most genes in most
metazoans. Introns are known to both increase expression levels and provide means for making
different protein products from the same gene via alternative splicing. It is thought that evolution
has selected for these functions of introns. Here we present evidence for an additional reason
why so many metazoan genes have introns, and why some do not. We found that introns control
stochasticity in metazoan gene expression. They do this by controlling stochastic autosomal allele
bias. We determined this by measuring the expression of differently colored reporter alleles with
and without introns. We find that introns control stochastic autosomal allele biases using a 5’position dependent mechanism. Intron control of allele expression noise provides an additional
mechanism to consider when pondering why so many metazoan genes have introns and why
some have lost them.

INTRODUCTION
Many discrete traits are incompletely penetrant, and this includes many human diseases.
For example, dominant negative oncogenic mutations associated with Noonan’s syndrome and
esophageal cancer are not 100% penetrant1,2. Furthermore, differences in genes and
environments do not account for differences in complex traits, including lifespan3,4 and complex
human diseases5, such as Parkinson’s disease6. That is, when genes and environments are held
as constants in laboratories, organisms still develop differences in both complex and discrete
traits. Underlying this are differences in the expression of genes (e.g., penetrance of skn-1
mutations in C. elegans7). Consequently, there has been a significant amount of experimentation
dedicated to defining and understanding the intrinsic, natural axes and mechanisms of variation
in gene expression. Systems biology studies in E. coli, S. cerevisiae and C. elegans have
dissected the physiological mechanisms of cell-to-cell variation in gene expression into
experimentally tractable bins8-11.
One of the major mechanisms by which gene expression can vary in eukaryotic cells is
stochastic autosomal allele expression bias, which we and others refer to and quantify as intrinsic
noise8. When intrinsic noise is high for a particular gene, cells within a tissue will present a
spectrum of gene expression possibilities, ranging from fully monoallelic (single allele expressed
while the other is silenced) to balanced biallelic expression (1:1 ratio of alleles). When intrinsic
noise is low for a particular gene, the majority of cells within a tissue will present as biallelic. This
intrinsic noise is distinct from parental imprinting or X inactivation, and is reviewed from different
perspectives here12, here13 and here14,15. These different groups refer to this phenomenon, or
aspects of it, as intrinsic noise12, stochastic autosomal allele expression bias13, allele specific
expression14,15, or monoallelic expression12-15.
Intrinsic noise is a quantitative measure of the deviation from a perfect 1:1 ratio, visible as
deviation from the diagonal trend line in a scatter plot of allele expression values. This is
demonstrated in images and scatter plots from single cells in8. When Raser and O’Shea quantified
intrinsic noise in yeast, they found that alleles controlled by the PHO5 promoter were expressed
along a continuum, ranging from monoallelic to biallelic. Later, genome wide SNP arrays, RNAseq and ChIP-seq surveys of human and murine cells found extreme stochastic allele bias (often
monoallelic) to be widespread16-21. This extreme allele bias can have many consequences,
including: loss of allele-specific biochemical function, altered biochemical capacity conferred by
different dosages of gene product, escape from a dominant negative phenotype, or condemnation
to the manifestation of a negative recessive phenotype. Quantifying the baseline of allele bias
and the factors that affect it are critical for understanding missing heritability and incomplete
penetrance of human diseases.
Introns are noncoding DNA elements found between most coding regions of a gene. Work
from us22 and others (reviewed in23,24), has shown that, in addition to the role introns have in
alternative splicing, introns act to increase expression levels. Moreover, the presence of short
introns close to the transcription start site (TSS) are associated with active chromatin marks,
increased transcription and more accurate TSS usage25. Given these particular functions of
introns in gene expression control, we hypothesized that introns could also affect the probability
that both alleles of a gene are expressed. If true, then introns should decrease intrinsic noise. To
test this hypothesis, we took the approach of quantifying intrinsic noise at the protein level, for
reporter allele pairs with and without introns, in the tissues of live C. elegans.
In this study, we found intrinsic noise to be visually detectable in microscopic images of
cells in C. elegans tissues. We found that introns can decrease intrinsic noise by an order of

magnitude. We found this to be true for synthetic and natural introns. We also found that introns
control intrinsic noise in both diploid and polyploid tissues. We found introns control intrinsic noise
using a 5’-position dependent mechanism. Taken together, these results suggest that introns
increase the probability of balanced, unbiased expression of autosomal alleles. This additional
function of introns might explain why some genes have lost introns (e.g., diversity may be good
for immune genes) and why most genes have retained introns. Intron control of intrinsic noise
may also explain why some deep intronic mutations can result in allele silencing and are
associated with human disease. Below, we show our results and then discuss the implications for
cis control of intrinsic noise in metazoans.
RESULTS
Here, we set out to study intrinsic noise in vivo, at the protein level, in the somatic tissues
of the metazoan Caenorhabditis elegans. Specifically, we used reporter alleles controlled by the
hsp-90 promoter26 to conduct a survey of allele bias in C. elegans tissues. Figure 1 shows a
diagram of differently colored reporter alleles encoding mCherry or mEGFP, and what high and
low intrinsic noise would look like in the intestine tissue. A color-blind friendly version of the figure
is available as Fig. S1. If alleles were expressed in a balanced biallelic fashion, then the color of
the cells would be yellow, a merge of mEGFP (green) and mCherry (red). If there was a significant
amount of allele bias, then cells would appear as color-shifted towards the color of the allele for
which they are biased, shown in Figs. 1B&S1B. High noise animals would appear as a random
“patch-work” of allelically biased and balanced cells.
When we surveyed the tissues of day 2 adult C. elegans, scanning the heads and torsos
of 40 individual worms, we observed striking allele bias in cells in several tissues, shown in Fig.
2. Note that these tissues are packed together in their native interior milieu27. Figure 2A shows a
schematic cartoon overview of the worm. Figures 2B-H show representative microscopic images
of various tissues surveyed. Figure 2B shows biased striated body wall muscles with the majority
of other cells appearing yellow (biallelic). In the image, one can clearly observe that some muscle
cells are skewed towards exclusively expressing the green or red allele. Figures 2C-E show
higher magnification images of 4 neighboring muscle cells (labeled 1-4). Figure 2C shows the
merged image, followed by the green channel (Fig. 2D) and red channel (Fig. 2E). For muscle
cell number 2, notice that it appears red in the merged image and that the green signal is
completely absent (mEGFP must have been absent from the cell or at a quantity below detection).
In Figs. 2C-E, muscle cells 1&3 also appear to be monoallelic for the green allele, while muscle
cell 4 is biallelic. Figures 2F-H show additional cells with extreme allele bias, including the
excretory cell canal, a dorsal nerve cord, intestine cells, arcade cells and the smooth muscles in
the pharynx.
The hsp-90 reporter alleles used for the tissue survey contained fluorescent reporter
genes with the same three synthetic introns typically used in C. elegans reporters28-30. We recently
showed that these introns increase gene expression levels in C. elegans using a conserved 5’proximal intron position dependent mechanism31. In 2012, another report detailed that 5’-introns
recruit chromatin marks associated with (or causative of) an active chromatin state25. The idea
that emerged from considering these two studies is that, if introns open chromatin and increase
expression levels, then introns should also increase the probability that both alleles of a gene are
expressed. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that introns affect intrinsic noise. To test our
hypothesis, we engineered worms to express reporter alleles that were identical to the hsp-90
alleles used in the above survey, but we removed introns from the coding sequence of the
fluorescent proteins (Fig 3A). We then measured the expression levels of the intron-bearing and
intronless sets of reporter alleles, which were expressed from the exact same locus (tt5605 on

Chromosome II), using a confocal microscope (Fig. 3B), as we described previously32. We
quantified allele bias in individual worm intestine cells as intrinsic noise, visible as deviation from
the 45° central trendline on scatter plots, using the same analytical framework as prior reports
quantifying intrinsic noise in bacteria9 and yeast8 cells.
Figure 3C shows a representative image of the anterior half of an intestine, from an animal
that expresses intron-bearing alleles. Notice that intestine cells appear yellow, due to biallelic
expression. Figure 3D shows a representative image of another anterior intestine, from an animal
that expresses intronless reporter alleles. In this animal, some cells appear yellow due to biallelic
expression, while others are skewed towards either the red or green allele. Additional images are
found in Fig. 4B. Figure 3E shows the scatter plots from this experiment, with intron containing
alleles represented by white dots and intronless alleles represented by black dots. More deviation
from the 45° trendline indicates more intrinsic noise. Some cells expressing intron-bearing alleles
(white dots) deviate relatively far from the 45° trendline, but most do not, indicating relatively low
intrinsic noise. However, the intronless alleles (black dots) deviate further and more frequently,
surrounding the intron-bearing alleles in the scatter plot. In fact, the removal of synthetic introns
from alleles significantly increased median intrinsic noise in gene expression by approximately an
order of magnitude, from 0.00275 to 0.0255, shown in Fig. 3H (P < 0.05; See Supplementary
Information for additional details like Q scores). We found the same effect when one of the
reporter alleles contained two natural introns found in hsp-90, shown in Fig. 3H (median intrinsic
noise from 0.00376 to 0.0255; P < 0.05). Thus, the presence of introns in the coding sequence of
these alleles reduced stochastic allele biases, thereby increasing the probability of a biallelic state
of gene expression. This previously undescribed function for introns may be important for
ensuring the high level of coordinated gene expression that multicellular life requires. We call this
intron-control of intrinsic noise (ICON).
Genes are often regulated in a tissue specific manner, and chromatin signature based
evidence suggests that this is true for monoallelic expression as well20,33,34. Specifically, at the
monoallelic gene expression database, some genes appear to have a monoallelic chromatin
signature in some but not all tissues investigated. These reports suggest that intrinsic noise for a
given gene may also be tissue specific in C. elegans. Additionally, intrinsic noise should be higher
in diploid tissues, relative to polyploid tissues, because polyploid tissues have more chances
(copies of the diploid genome) to express both alleles. To answer these questions, we used the
same hsp-90 reporter alleles described above to study intrinsic noise in diploid muscle cells.
Similar to what we see in intestine cells, muscle cells that express intron-bearing alleles
appear mostly yellow, indicating biallelic expression, though some cells are extremely biased (Fig.
4C). Animals expressing intronless alleles showed a far more variegated gene expression pattern
(Fig. 4C). When we quantified intrinsic noise in both sets of animals, we found that introns
decreased median intrinsic noise in muscles by more than an order of magnitude, from a median
value of 0.0489 to 0.00365 (Fig. 3G; P < 0.05).
When we combined data from all of our experiments in intestine and muscle cells, we
found that intrinsic noise was significantly higher in (2n) muscle cells than in (16n) polyploid
intestines (Fig. 3H; P < 0.001; One Way ANOVA with Dunn’s for all alleles together). This result
is expected, given the increased chance for biallelic expression in polyploid cells. However, when
we looked at just intron-bearing alleles, the difference was not significant (P = 0.11 in One-Way
ANOVA with Dunn’s test; Power below 0.8; not a confident negative result). Thus, the tissuespecific difference in intrinsic noise for all hsp-90 alleles together is driven by the intronless alleles.
This is likely due to the differences in intrinsic noise set points between intronless and intronbearing allele pairs. Since intron-bearing alleles are mainly biallelic (low intrinsic noise set point),

there is a relatively small decrease in noise that is possible, indicating the strong influence introns
have in restricting seemingly stochastic, cell autonomous allele biases.
Intrinsic noise is known to be controlled by promoter sequence in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae8. To determine if ICON was affected by promoter in metazoans, we measured the
same reporter alleles with and without introns, controlled by two additional promoters. We tested
the promoter from vit-2, which encodes intestinally expressed yolk protein, and is perhaps the
strongest promoter in C. elegans35. For these allele pairs, we found that introns significantly
decreased median intrinsic noise by about 82%, from 0.00722 to 0.00133 (Figs. 5A&C; P < 0.05).
We also tested a distinctly regulated, inducible, small heat shock protein promoter from hsp16.236,37. In animals expressing hsp-16.2 reporter alleles, the presence of introns decreased
intrinsic noise by about 50%, from 0.00931 to 0.00417 (Figs. 5B&C; P < 0.05). While introns
restricted intrinsic noise under the control of distinct promoters, the effect sizes were different,
demonstrating that promoters also affected allele bias. Our finding that each gene can have a
gene-specific quantity of (or set-point for) intrinsic noise is in agreement with different promoters
having different amounts of intrinsic noise in diploid yeast8. Statistical comparisons of alleles
controlled by different promoters with and without introns or all together are shown in
Supplements (Statistical Analyses, pages 5&6).
Next, because introns close to the TSS are associated with open chromatin markings25,
we hypothesized that the same 5’-position dependent mechanism used for IME31 may also be
used for ICON. To test this, we created reporter allele pairs with a single intron positioned close
to the transcription start site, or positioned more distally toward the 3’UTR (here, called 5’-intron
or 3’-intron, respectively). Worms that expressed alleles with 5’-introns had balanced biallelic
expression, similar to the worms that expressed alleles with multiple introns. Worms expressing
alleles with single 3’-introns showed a variegated allele expression patterns, similar to intronless
worms. Alleles with single 5’-introns had significantly less intrinsic noise than alleles with single
3’-introns (0.00296 vs .00928 for median intrinsic noise; P < 0.05), shown in Fig. 5E. Thus, the
mechanism by which introns control intrinsic noise is intron-position dependent. Fig. 5F shows a
graphical illustration of the major findings of this study.
About 3% of C. elegans’ protein-coding genes are intronless (Data S2). Of the 20,390
protein-coding genes in the human genome (GRCh38), 1,165 are intronless – about 6% (Data
S2). We performed GO terms enrichment analyses on human intronless genes and found many
immune activity-related GO terms (Data S2). We also found enrichment for “G protein coupled
receptor activity” and “olfactory receptor activity”. Olfactory receptors are known to be expressed
in an exclusively monoallelic fashion38. Over 500 of the intronless genes are listed as monoallelic
in the database for monoallelic expression (dbMAE33; Data S2). It is possible some genes lost
introns to ensure variegated allele expression. It now seems plausible that many metazoan genes
retain introns because they decrease intrinsic noise. Put differently, introns increase the chance
for equal expression of both parental alleles in a cell. Intron control of intrinsic noise may be one
additional reason why many metazoan genes have introns, especially those genes that retain
single, relatively 5’ introns and have no alternative splicing isoforms.
DISCUSSION
Previous reports analyzed intrinsic noise in bacteria9, and in diploid yeast8. For these
organisms, intrinsic noise is higher by about an order of magnitude or more than what we have
measured here in the metazoan, C. elegans. Intrinsic noise appears to be more restricted in
metazoans. Most genes in the human genome, and in most metazoan genomes for that matter,
have introns. Considering our results, it seems likely that one reason to have introns is to ensure

coordinated and robust gene expression in multicellular organisms. In metazoans, like humans,
the question remains as to why some genes have lost their introns39. For some classes of genes,
like chaperones, the loss seems attributable to poor splicing at higher temperatures. For other
classes of genes, loss of introns may occur to ensure variegated allele expression. For example,
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have lost introns at a relatively increased rate 39.
Variegation of cell surface receptor alleles may be advantageous for ensuring some cells remain
uninfected by a virus (Red Queen hypothesis reviewed in40).
Single, 5’-positioned introns are sufficient for IME41 presumably because, among other
reasons, they recruit chromatin opening marks25. Our data suggest that this same mechanism is
shared with ICON. However, the data for effect sizes of ICON compared to IME suggest that there
may also be mechanistic components that are not shared between these phenomena. We
previously showed that IME effect size was similar under control of the vit-2 and hsp-90 promoters
(about 50%)31. Here, using the same promoters, we found that vit-2 and hsp-90 had different
ICON effect sizes (50% vs. an approximate order of magnitude in the intestine cells). Thus, while
promoter had little influence on IME, it had a large influence on ICON. This difference suggests
that the underlying mechanisms controlling IME and ICON may not be entirely the same.
Our experimental system showed that intrinsic noise can be a significant component of
cell-to-cell variation in gene expression in vivo in the metazoan C. elegans. These results are
significant because they demonstrate that intrinsic noise can be observed in an experimentally
tractable metazoan in vivo, corroborating previous in vitro studies17,21,42,43. Additionally, these
results are significant because they allow us to examine intrinsic noise at the protein level,
complementing RNA based studies. In some scenarios, there can be little correlation between
protein and RNA levels, as in44, and reviewed in 2012 here45 and in 2016 here46. Additionally,
studies of allele bias at the RNA level can sometimes have trouble distinguishing between
transcriptional bursting47 and actual allele bias that manifests at the protein level13. Detecting allele
specific expression at the protein level by means other than those described here remain
challenging. For example, it can be technically difficult or impossible to generate antibodies that
distinguish between two allelic variants of the same gene. We anticipate that this experimental
system can be used to identify trans acting factors that control intrinsic noise.
RNA and chromatin marking based evidence suggests that extreme allele bias or
monoallelic gene expression is prevalent in murine and human cells16-21. Furthermore, monoallelic
expression of particular genes could explain some perplexing clinical scenarios. For example,
some people harbor dominant negative oncogenes, but remain cancer free1,2. It would be
interesting to monitor healthy tissue in these scenarios to determine if the dominant negative allele
is being silenced. In another scenario, fortunate monoallelic expression of a “good” allele
protected some, but not all, family members from the negative consequences of a dominant
negative PIT1 allele48. In this study, the father and grandmother of the affected patient harbored
the dominant negative allele, but no mRNA of that allele was detected, suggesting that they were
protected by allelic silencing. Finally, an intriguing clinical case of a single patient with COL6A2associated Bethlem myopathy suggests that intronic mutations can lead to silencing and potential
disease49. In this study, the affected patient harbored one allele with a large intronic mutation and
a second allele with a mutation in exon 28 that is predicted to cause disease. The allele with the
intronic mutation was silenced, leading to the sole expression of the potential disease allele.
Taken together, these cases demonstrate that extreme allele bias can be consequential, and
support the idea that introns increase the probability of a balanced, biallelic state of gene
expression. More work is necessary to determine how different lengths and sequences of introns,
or sequences within introns, including clinically relevant mutations, influence intrinsic noise.

Fig. 1. Experimental Schematics. A) shows a cartoon detailing that cells contain two otherwise
identical copies of alleles encoding two spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. B) shows cartoon
examples of what high and low intrinsic noise would look like among the twenty cells comprising
the worm intestine tissue. The top panel shows low intrinsic noise, which appear as yellow cells,
because yellow is the balanced blend of red and green. The lower panel shows high intrinsic
noise, which appears as an array of randomly biased and balanced cells; some cells appear
yellow, and some cells are mostly, or all, red or green. Fig. S1 shows a colorblind friendly version
of the cartoon in which green is switched to blue.

center of each animal. C) shows a composite confocal micrograph of four body wall muscle cells
from an individual animal, each numbered 1-4. D&E show the individual mEGFP and mCherry
channels. Cells 1, 2 & 3 were monoallelic (or really extreme), and cell 4 expressed both alleles.
F) shows another animal with allele bias/monoallelic expression in muscle cells, a dorsal nerve
cord and the excretory cell canal. G) shows another animal with allele bias in muscle cells,
intestine cells and the excretory cell canal. H) shows the head of an animal with monoallelic
expression/allele bias in its smooth pharynx muscles and the structural arcade cells. Red puncta
are lysosomes, delineated by concentrated, acid/protease resistant, mCherry 4,50. Images with
clear bias and good cell positioning were selected from four independent experiments capturing
z stack image sets of ten two day old adult animals in each experiment.

Fig. 4. Cartoon schematics and microscopic images of alleles with and without introns in
intestine and muscle tissues. A) shows cartoon images of what high and low intrinsic noise in
intestine cells would look like. Images in B&C are fluorescent micrographs showing expression
of hsp-90 controlled reporter alleles encoding mCherry or mEGFP in individual cells in intact
intestine and muscle tissues. Anterior is left, and dorsal is top. The top of each image contains a
dotty swath of adjacent hypodermal tissue. The first representative animal in each group shown
is displayed in individual and merged microscopic channels, and the tissues of the subsequent
individual animals, labeled 2-5 are shown as merged microscopic images. B) shows expression
of reporter alleles with and without introns in polyploid intestine cells. C) shows expression of
reporter alleles with and without introns in diploid striated muscle cells. We arbitrarily selected
images from the images underlying the data Fig.3 in which animals and their tissues were better
oriented for viewing the cell types with minimal distortion by other tissues or oblique viewing
angles. This tends to be more difficult for the muscle cells because C. elegans prefer to orient
their lateral faces towards the ground, not unlike a flounder. And, in the top right series of images
of muscles from animals expressing intronless alleles, the hypodermal swath of issue is largely
in view, and a white arrow points to a virtually monoallelic green cell, oriented obliquely.
