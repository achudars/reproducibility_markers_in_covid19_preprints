Abstract
The assembly of signaling hierarchies and their spatiotemporal organization together,
contribute to diverse signaling outcomes. This is evident in the Notch pathway, which
regulates an array of cellular processes, despite a small number of core components.
Here, we describe a Notch4 activated signaling cascade, dependent on the nucleolar
localization of the Notch4 Intracellular Domain (NIC4), that protects cells from
genotoxic damage. Localization was assessed by immune-staining for endogenous
Notch4 and visualization by confocal microscopy, in breast cancer cell lines. Live-cell,
imaging-based, biophysical analysis of NIC4-GFP expressing cells, indicated
unhindered mobility between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm and a stable nucleolar
pool of NIC4-GFP. RNAi-mediated ablations, coupled with analysis of recombinant
forms of NIC4 with modifications of its nucleolar localization sequence, confirmed
nucleolar localization and identified the nucleolar proteins, Nucleolin and Fibrillarin,
as key intermediates in the NIC4-activated signaling cascade. The transcriptional
control of ribosome biogenesis (47s and 45s pre-rRNA transcription), emerged as
another unexpected consequence of the subcellular distribution of NIC4. Taken
together, this study describes intrinsic features of NIC4 that confer spatial flexibility
and expand the repertoire of Notch4 signaling.

Introduction
Signaling through the Notch receptors protects from diverse apoptotic stimuli
[1,2,3,4]. In mammals, four Notch receptors Notch1-4 are known, which are activated
by binding to one of five ligands, Delta-like 1/3/4 or Jagged 1/2 [5,6]. Notch receptors
typically contain an extracellular domain consisting of multiple EGF-like repeats, a
trans-membrane domain and an intracellular domain [7]. Upon ligand binding, the
Notch receptor undergoes a series of proteolytic cleavages, releasing the intracellular
domain (NIC) into the cytoplasm [8,9,10]. In the nucleus, NIC complexes with
cofactors RBPj-κ and Mastermind like (MAML) to form an activation complex,
which induces transcription of various key genes [11,12].

Apart from this core canonical pathway, there are several reports of atypical ligandindependent and non-nuclear Notch signaling in diverse systems [13,14,15,16,17].
While Notch1 signaling has been explored in multiple development and disease
contexts; studies investigating Notch4 have mainly focused on its role in the
endothelial system and resistance to treatment in cancers [3,18,19,20]. Hence, the
molecular regulation of Notch4 signaling is not completely elucidated. Here, the intracellular response to agents that trigger genomic damage is used to characterize the
mechanism underlying one aspect of NIC4-mediated signaling in mammalian cells.
Building upon its observed distribution in the nucleolus (and nucleoplasm), NIC4mediated anti-apoptotic activity is assessed for dependence on nucleolar proteins,
canonical regulators of NIC transcription, as well as molecules implicated in sensing
and repair of genomic damage. The analysis of molecular dynamics and spatially
restricted recombinant forms of NIC4, revealing specific functions of nucleolar pools
of NIC4 are described. Apart from demonstrating a requirement for nucleolar proteins
in protection from genomic damage, these experiments uncover an unexpected role
for NIC4 in ribosome biogenesis. Taken together, the data show that spatial regulation
i.e. its nucleolar localization, expands the repertoire of signaling cascades activated by
NIC4.

Transfections
HEK cells grown in flasks were trypsinized and seeded at a density of 0.25x106 cells
in (tissue culture grade) 35mm culture dishes (Greiner Bio-one, Kremsmünster,
Austria). 100nM siRNA or plasmids at indicated concentrations were transfected with
Dharmafect or Liofectamine 2000 as per the manufacturer's instructions when
cultures were 50-60% confluent (by 24 h post-plating). Cells transfected with siRNA

transfected

with control or gene-specific siRNA. 48 h post siRNA transfection,

0.5x10 cells were lysed using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by RNA isolation as per
manufacturer’s instructions. 2μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using
Superscript First Strand cDNA synthesis kit and real time PCR was setup using gene
specific primers.

Induction of apoptosis and assays for cellular damage
To assess apoptotic damage, 24 h post-transfection cells were treated with Etoposide
(10µM) or 5-Fluorouracil (10µM) or 4-Nitroquinoline N-oxide (5µM), for 48 h in
serum free DMEM (HEK293T) or 2.5% serum containing DMEM (MDA-MB-231).
Cells were treated with Thapsigargin (10µM) for 20 h in serum-free DMEM. Cells
were harvested and stained with Hoechst 33342 (1μg/ml) and cells scored for nuclear
damage in GFP positive cells using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX-60).
Approximately 200 cells in five random fields were scored for apoptotic damage.

Immunostaining
For immunostaining Notch4, Notch1 and Nucleolin, the following protocol was used.
Cells were plated at 0.3 x106 cells in cut confocal dishes and cultured for 48 h to
adhere and increase in number. The monolayer was fixed with 2% PFA (freshly
reconstituted) and incubated in the dark for 20 min at ambient temperature. Dishes
were permeabilized using 0.2% Triton-X 100 for 10 min at ambient temperature and
blocked in freshly made buffer (5% Normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton) for one hour at
ambient temperature. Samples were treated with primary antibody, added at the
indicated dilutions in 5% BSA-PBS, Nucleolin (1:100), N4 (1:100), N1 (1:100 ), for
2.5 h at ambient temperature. Samples were washed 2x in PBS and secondary
fluorescence-conjugated antibody was added and samples incubated for 1 h, protected
from light at ambient temperature. Samples were washed 2x with PBS, counterstained
with Hoechst 33342 and imaged.

Real Time-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer’s
instructions and concentration was determined using the Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo

Co-localization analysis
HEK cells transfected with NIC4-GFP and Fibrillarin-RFP (1µg), were cultured for
24 h post-transfection and fixed with 2% PFA. Images were acquired using Olympus
FV3000 confocal microscope (63 X NA 1.35 oil-immersion objectives). Colocalization of NIC1-GFP or NIC4-GFP with Fibrillarin-RFP was quantitated using
co-localization threshold plugin after removing background in Fiji Image J software.
Manders correlations coefficient is proportional to the fraction of fluorescence
intensity of one channel that co-localizes with the other channel and ranges from 0
(no co-localization) to 1 (maximum co-localization).

FRAP and FLIP analysis
HEK cells were co-transfected with NIC4-GFP (0.5µg) and Fibrillarin-RFP (0.5µg),
18-24 h prior to analysis. For these experiments, cells were plated and transfected on
sterile cover-slips fixed in Petri-dishes to allow for confocal imaging and analysis of
cells without trypsinization. Cells were imaged using Olympus FV3000 (oil
immersion objective, 63X. 1.35 NA). The FRAP module was used to photo-bleach
and acquire images every 2 sec immediately after photo bleaching the region of

interest (ROI, white arrowhead in images). Fluorescence recovery was quantified
after correcting for photo-bleaching using cellSens software.

For the Fluorescence Loss In Photobleaching (FLIP) analysis, HEK cells were
transfected with NIC4-GFP (0.5µg) and Fibrillarin-RFP (0.5µg) using Fugene HD
and cultured for 24 h. FLIP analysis was performed on Olympus FV3000 at 60x oil
objective with 37 °C stage incubator. ROI was drawn around nucleus excluding
nucleolus and photo-bleaching (of ROI) was done for 700 milliseconds with 60% of
laser (488 or 561). Time lapse images were acquired every 2 sec before and after
bleaching. Fluorescence intensities of NIC4-GFP and Fibrillarin-RFP in the ROI
restricted to the nucleolus were quantified using Fiji Image J software.

Statistical Analysis
Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation (Mean ± SD) for three independent
experiments. Statistical significance was measured using two-tailed Student’s t-test
and p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Data plotted for
FRAP and FLIP analysis are mean ± SD from two experiments

Results
Notch4 regulates susceptibility to genomic damage
Chemicals such as etoposide and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) target the genome triggering
damage to DNA and apoptosis in mammalian cells [22,23].

Implicating Notch

signaling in protection from genomic damage, RNAi-mediated ablation of Notch4
increased the sensitivity of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 to apoptosis
triggered by etoposide or 5-FU (Fig. 1A). Conversely, expressing the processed
intracellular domain of Notch4 (NIC4), protects cells from apoptotic damage (Fig.
1B). Immuno-staining and visualization by confocal microscopy of its subcellular
distribution, revealed discrete intense areas and a more generalized or diffuse
distribution in the nucleus (green, Fig. 1C), as well as staining at the cell membrane
(Fig. 1C and Supplementary Figure 1A). Intriguingly, the brighter intense spots
overlapped with staining for Nucleolin (red, Fig. 1C), indicating co-localization at the
nucleolus [24]. Notch4 staining was not detected in the nucleus in cells treated with a

gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI)-X, which block Notch processing at the membrane
and release of the intracellular domain (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Figure 1B),
indicating that the antibody detects processed Notch4 (NIC4). The non-nuclear
staining seen in GSI-X treated groups, is most likely reporting full-length Notch4,
which is expectedly insensitive to GSI treatment.

NIC4-mediated protection from genotoxic agents was also observed in the HEK cell
line treated with etoposide or 5-FU (Fig. 1E) or following treatment with the
quinolone compound 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide (4NQO) (Fig. 1F), which mimics
radiation induced DNA damage [25]. Further, in HEK cells, NIC4-GFP was observed
in the nucleoplasm as well as the nucleolus where it localized with co-transfected
Fibrillarin-RFP, which marks nucleoli (Fig. 1G and Supplementary Figure 1C).
Further, this pattern was also reproduced in MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing
NIC4-GFP, with the recombinant protein showing a distribution similar to
endogenous NIC4

(Fig. 1H and Supplementary Figure 1D).

Together these

experiments establish that endogenous and overexpressed NIC4 is present in the
nucleolus and nucleoplasm. Further, the experiments suggest that NIC4 regulates
protection from genomic damage. Molecular complexes that coordinate the cellular
response to DNA damage are present in the nucleolus [26,27]. Before assessing the
functional consequences of its sub-cellular localization, we tested NIC4 dependence
on nucleolar proteins for its anti-apoptotic activity.

Dependence on nucleolar proteins for Notch4-mediated anti-apoptotic activity
NIC4-medaited anti-apoptotic activity was assessed following siRNA mediated
ablation of nucleolar proteins, Nucleolin (NCL) or Fibrillarin (FBL), in HEK cells.
Reduction in Nucleolin levels (Fig. 2A inset), abrogated NIC4-mediated protection
from apoptosis triggered by etoposide or 5-FU (Fig. 2A). Similarly, ablation of
Fibrillarin attenuated NIC4-mediated inhibition of etoposide or 4NQO induced
apoptosis (Fig. 2B and 2C). Notably, when tested in same assays, Bcl-xL (the BCl-2
family anti-apoptotic protein) mediated protection from genomic damage was
independent of FBL (Fig. 2B), indicating that ablation of NCL or FBL did not result
in global changes and a specificity in interactions with NIC4. Further, NIC4-mediated
anti-apoptotic activity was independent of its canonical nuclear partner RBPj-κ

(Supplementary Figure 2A), which regulates Notch transcription. Together, these
experiments demonstrate the activation of a distinct signaling cascade by NIC4.
Next, we asked if canonical intermediates of the cellular DNA damage response
machinery are required for NIC4 mediated anti-apoptotic activity.

NIC4 mediated protection converges on cellular DNA damage-sensing proteins
The MRN (Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1) sensor complex comprises three proteins
Mre11−Rad50−Nbs1 that act in concert to sense DNA damage and initiate repair
[29,30,31]. Employing siRNA mediated ablations, we tested the requirement for Nbs1
and Rad50 for NIC4-mediated protection from genomic damage. Depletion of Rad50
abrogated NIC4-mediated inhibition of 4NQO, 5-FU or etoposide induced apoptosis
(Fig. 2D and E), whereas Bcl-xL continued to inhibit apoptosis, following ablation of
Rad50 (Fig. 2E). Similarly, while Nbs1 is required for NIC4 mediated activity, BclxL mediated protection is independent of this intermediate (Fig. 2F). Thus, NIC4
signaling integrates with molecular complexes implicated in the sensing and repair of
genomic damage, as well as proteins resident in the nucleolus – FBL and NCL - for
anti-apoptotic activity.

Dynamics of NIC4 localization to the nucleolus
The experiments reveal a hitherto undescribed aspect of Notch4 signaling vis-à-vis
interactions with nucleolar proteins. In order to characterize the dynamics of the
nuclear pools of NIC4, we employed Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching
(FRAP) analysis in live cells co-expressing NIC4-GFP and Fibrillarin-RFP, which
indicated nucleoli. In this analysis, following a bleach of one spot marking nucleolarlocalized NIC4-GFP, the recovery of GFP fluorescence was rapid with approximately
60% of the original intensity restored within a few seconds’ post photo-bleaching (Fig.
3A, 3B and Supplementary Figure 3A). Hence, while a large proportion of NIC4-GFP
moves freely between the nucleoplasm and the nucleolus, a fraction of nucleolar
NIC4-GFP has restricted mobility or is immobile. Expectedly, the recovery of the
nucleolar protein Fibrillarin-RFP fluorescence following photo bleaching is low (Fig.
3A, 3B and Supplementary Figure 3A). NIC4-GFP dynamics remained the same in
cells treated with etoposide (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Figure 3B).

The mobility of the nucleolar pools of NIC4-GFP was next estimated by Fluorescence
loss in photo-bleaching (FLIP) analysis in live cells. In this assay, a region of the
nucleoplasm (which excludes the nucleolus) was photo-bleached and changes in
fluorescence, if any, in the nucleolus tracked over time. If NIC4 is freely diffusible,
diminished fluorescence in the nucleolus will be observed following the bleach of the
surrounding region. The loss of fluorescence of Fibrillarin-RFP was expected to be
minimal, as this protein was not detected in regions outside the nucleolus (Fig. 3D
and Supplementary Figure 3C). NIC4-GFP fluorescence in the nucleolus is reduced
by ~40%, relative to the intensity at the onset of the assay and did not diminish further
with time (Fig. 3D and inset images and Supplementary Figure 3C). This is consistent
with the immobile fraction of nucleolar NIC4-GFP revealed by the FRAP analysis
and raises the possibility of modifications or associations with nucleolar resident
proteins that regulate NIC4-GFP dynamics. Notably, nucleolar localization of NIC4
was unchanged in cells ablated for either NCL or FBL (Fig. 3E and Supplementary
Figure 3D).

Nucleolar localization of Notch4 in breast cancer cell lines
To confirm that the results were not restricted to one cell line, the localization of
endogenous Notch4 was assessed in HCC1086, BT-549, Hs578T, SUM149 and
MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines.

Notch4 (NIC4) staining was detected in the

nucleoplasm and co-localized with Nucleolin in all cell lines examined (Fig. 4A, 4B
and Supplementary Figure 4A-E). This is in striking contrast and distinct from the
distribution of the closely related protein, Notch1, wherein the processed receptor is
also nuclear localized but was excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 4C and
Supplementary Figure 4F-I). As seen in the MDA-MB-231 cells, siRNA mediated
silencing of Notch4 increased sensitivity of Hs578T cells to apoptotic damage by
etoposide or 5-FU (Fig. 4D), suggesting that Notch4 signaling sets the threshold for
sensitivity to apoptotic damage.

Ablation of Notch1 was without effect in this

context (Fig. 4D).

The nucleolus is a hub for ribosome biogenesis and several nucleolar proteins are
implicated in rRNA synthesis, maturation, and assembly [32,33,34]. Genome-wide
screens have shown that nucleosome organization and ribosome biogenesis can be
regulated by diverse cellular pathways [35,36], including signaling by a closely

related protein Notch2 [37]. To test if nucleolar localization resulted in Notch4
regulation of ribosome synthesis, levels of 47s and 45s ribosomal RNA precursor
transcripts were assessed, following the perturbation of Notch4. NCL ablation was
included as a positive control in this experiment. We find that siRNA mediated
ablation of Notch4 or Nucleolin, abrogated the induction of ribosomal 47S and 45S
pre-rRNA transcripts to a similar extent (Fig. 4E), whereas the ablation of Notch1 was
without effect (Fig. 4E). On the other hand, transcripts of the canonical Notch family
target gene Hes1, were dramatically reduced following the ablation Notch4 or Notch1
(Fig. 4E). Despite a reduction in the levels of Hes1 transcripts in the NCL siRNA
treated groups, relative to the scrambled control, the difference was not significant
(Fig. 4E).
Nucleolar localization is critical for NIC4-mediated anti-apoptotic activity
In the experiments that follow the analysis was extended to include spatially restricted
NIC4 mutants to more directly ascertain functional consequences of nucleolar
localization. We generated a recombinant form of NIC4 modified to increase
residence time in the nucleolus by an additional nucleolar localization sequence
(NoLS) derived from the NF-κB inducing kinase [38]. In order to disrupt NIC4
nucleolar localization [39], a second construct was generated with the positively
charged Arginine residues 1490,1492 and 1501 – in NIC4 NoLS – replaced by the
neutral amino acid Alanine (Fig. 5A). The sub-cellular localization of these constructs
– NIC4-NoLS and NIC4-3RA respectively - was visualized by confocal microscopy
following overexpression in HEK cells. The NIC4-3RA construct localized to the
nucleus but, is excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Figure 5A).
The NIC4-NoLS construct was expectedly enriched in the nucleolus but also detected
at low levels in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Figure 5B). Protection
from genomic damage was abrogated in cells expressing the NIC4-3RA construct
(Fig. 5B and 5C). However, protection from Thapsigargin (an ER stressor) induced
apoptosis was comparable in NIC4 and NIC4-3RA expressing cells (Supplementary
Fig. 5C), indicating that nucleolar localization was necessary for NIC4-mediated
protection from genomic damage. On the other hand, inhibition of genomic damage
by NIC4-NoLS was comparable to NIC4 (Fig. 5D).

We next tested if NIC4-mediated rDNA transcription was detected in cells expressing
NIC4-GFP or the spatially modified NIC43RA-GFP recombinant. Compared to the
GFP transfected group, an increase in pre-rRNA 47s and 45s transcripts was observed
in cells expressing NIC4, but not in cells expressing NIC4-3RA (Fig. 5E). The
induction of Hes5 transcripts was comparable in both groups (Fig. 5E), confirming
that activation of transcriptional outcomes by NIC4-3RA was not entirely abrogated.
Hes5 induction was reduced in cells expressing NIC4-NoLS (Supplementary Figure
5D), indicating differential outputs associated with NIC4 localization. The
transcription factor RBPj-κ

is a key intermediate in the transcription of Notch

(canonical) target genes. Confirming this dependence, Hes5 transcripts were not
induced when NIC4 or NIC4-3RA were expressed in cells treated with siRNA to
RBPj-κ (Fig. 5F). However, the induction of 47S and 45S rRNA transcripts was not
compromised by the ablation of RBPj-κ and remained comparable to the control
siRNA (scrambled) group (Fig. 5F). This is consistent with differential regulation of
transcription occurring in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. Together, these experiments
illustrate that spatial segregation of Notch4 results in diverse signaling outcomes that
are distinct and uncoupled from the canonical pathway activated by NIC4 signaling in
the nucleoplasm (Fig. 5G).

Discussion
Notch family proteins integrate with a range of signaling cascades that underlie
pleiotropic outcomes of Notch signaling.

In this study we report new aspects of

Notch 4 signaling, which show that spatial regulation of Notch4 results in the
diversification of signaling pathways initiated by Notch4 activity. To our knowledge,
this is the first demonstration of the nucleolar localization of Notch4 and functional
consequences of this sub-cellular distribution. Both protection from genomic damage
as well as the regulation of ribosome synthesis was compromised following disruption
of the NoLS in NIC4. Nucleolar localization of NIC4 was established for endogenous
and over-expressed protein, using imaging analysis also coupled to biophysical
measurements. NIC4 mediated protection from genomic damage was independent of
canonical signaling through RBPj-κ, a feature shared with the closely related protein
Notch1 [28]. NIC4 localization and regulation of ribosome biogenesis was validated

in multiple cell lines as well as in cells overexpressing NIC4 and spatially restricted
forms of the same.

We demonstrate dependence on nucleolar proteins Nucleolin and Fibrillarin for
Notch4-mediated protection from genomic damage.

This dependency is specific to

Notch4 as it is not observed with Bcl-xL, a member of the Bcl-2 family, which also
protects from apoptosis triggered by genotoxic agents. We show that ablation of
Notch4 but not Notch1 in the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T
modulated sensitivity to genotoxic stress. These experiments and observations with
modified forms of NIC4, provide compelling evidence that NIC4 signaling integrates
with proteins in the nucleolus to mediate a distinct signaling pathway for the
protection from DNA damage. While the sub-cellular distribution of NIC4 in the
nucleolus is not regulated by Fibrillarin or Nucleolin, these proteins are key, nonredundant intermediates of the NIC4-activated signaling cascade.

Somewhat

unexpectedly we observed that NIC4 controls transcription of ribosomal pre-rRNA,
implicating Notch4 in ribosome biogenesis, although the physiological consequences
of this central cellular process, remains to be investigated. Together, these
observations suggest an additional layer of regulation of Notch4 activity with
implications for growth regulation in development and disease [40, 41, 42, 43].

This study raises broader questions of the regulation of Notch family proteins. Notch4
is upregulated in breast cancers and its inhibition reported to reduce invasiveness and
tumorigenic properties in models of breast cancer and in cell lines [44,45,46,47].
Evidence that specific increases in Notch4, is coincident with reductions in other
receptors indicating a switch to the activation of Notch4 signaling in cancer stem cells,
may correlate with the acquisition of drug-resistance in breast cancers [46,48,49,50].
The inhibition of etoposide or 5-FU induced apoptosis in cells expressing NIC4 is
consistent with reports that Notch inhibition sensitizes various tumors to
chemotherapy [51]. To this end, our experiments have identified previously
unappreciated interactions arising from its nucleolar location that are critical to
Notch4 signaling. Collectively, this study provides yet another example of how
spatial regulation of the Notch family [14,16,17,52,53] expands the repertoire of
signaling

The schematic (not drawn to scale) summarizes key observations of the current study.
We show that NIC4 localizes to the nucleolus and demonstrate dependency on
nucleolar proteins – Nucleolin and Fibrillarin – for protection from genotoxic agents.
Further, NIC4 mediated anti-apoptotic activity is dependent on canonical regulators of
the DNA damage response. The experiments reveal a functional role for a Nucleolar
localization sequence (NoLS) in NIC4, which agrees with NIC4 regulation of preribosomal RNA transcription reported in this study.
