Abstract

28

Alternative splicing is a ubiquitous mechanism for producing different mRNA species from a

29

single gene, resulting in proteomic diversity. Despite potential for regulating embryogenesis,

30

its developmental role remains under-investigated. The Jun kinase (Jnk) genes, considered

31

downstream effectors of the non-canonical Wnt planar cell polarity pathway, utilise extensive

32

and evolutionarily-conserved alternative splicing. Although many PCP members are

33

associated with heart malformation, the role of Jnk genes in cardiac development, and

34

specifically which alternatively spliced transcripts orchestrate these processes, remain

35

unknown. In this study we exploit the jnk1 duplication and subspecialisation found in zebrafish

36

to reveal an essential and non-redundant requirement for jnk1a in cardiac development. We

Introduction

47

Over 1% of the population have structural congenital heart disease (CHD) [1]. Despite

48

several studies finding genes associated with syndromic heart disease [2-5], genes

49

contributing to CHD in the vast majority of patients remain elusive. An alternative to

50

population based genomic studies is the use of developmental biology approaches to

51

understand how the heart forms and identify pathways and genes that are relevant to CHD.

52

One genetic pathway that has been shown to be important in pre-clinical models is the non-

53

canonical Wnt, planar-cell polarity (PCP) pathway. Disruption of key genes such as Vangl2,

54

Dvl2 and Celsr1, reviewed in [6], have been shown to cause cardiac malformations,

55

specifically involving addition of second heart field precursors [7]. Inactivation of downstream

56

pathway effectors, such as Rac1 [8,9] and Rho Kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2 [10] also produce

57

cardiac defects.

58
59

The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1, 2 and 3) are members of the mitogen activated protein

60

kinase (MAPK) family, but are also recognised as mediators of PCP signalling, acting

61

downstream of RhoA. These stress-responsive serine/threonine kinases are implicated in a

62

diverse range of biological processes including embryonic development, brain signalling,

63

tumour survival and metastasis, through control of cell proliferation, cell death and direct

64

regulation of gene expression (reviewed in [11]). Jnk is phosphorylated by MAP kinase

65

kinases (MAP2K), which in turn are activated by MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAP3K) [12],

66

but also integrates signals from the RAS and AKT pathways, for example, the R497Q

67

mutation in SOS1, found in patients with Noonan syndrome, has been shown to directly

68

activate Jnk [13]. Alternative splicing is a universally applied gene regulatory mechanism that

69

increases the diversity of gene products; up to 95% of all human genes undergo alternative

70

splicing (14). The Jnk genes have strong evolutionary conservation and undergo alternative

71

splicing to provide a range of transcripts. For each gene, alternative usage of two

72

neighbouring exons creates alternative peptide structures. In addition, Jnk1 and Jnk2, but

73

not Jnk3, have truncated or extended C termini, which are manifest as either 46 or 54 kDa-

74

sized peptides. An alternative translation initiation site for Jnk3 increases the range of

75

transcripts to 10 for that gene [15, 16]. The functional significance of these different

76

transcripts is unknown. Differential expression of different splice isoforms of Jnk1 has been

77

shown within NIH3T3 fibroblasts [17], but expression of the alternatively spliced transcripts

78

has not been examined in animal studies. Little is known of their roles in heart development

79

[11]. Null mutant mice are available and whilst both Jnk1 and Jnk2 are co-expressed in

80

almost all cells and tissues, Jnk3 has been said to be expressed predominantly in the brain,

81

testes and heart [18]. This redundancy of expression and likely function is one reason why

82

identifying the roles of JNK has been difficult, particularly those in cardiovascular

83

development. The Jnk1 null mouse is viable and fertile, with no obvious malformations, but

84

has abnormal differentiation of T-helper cells and reduced adipose tissue [18]. Similarly, the

85

Jnk2 null mouse also has abnormalities of T-cell function and abnormal brain development

86

[18, 19, 20]. In contrast the Jnk3 null mouse is essentially normal and despite the specific

87

expression of Jnk3 within the central nervous system, has normal brain histology [18, 19].

88

Attempts to unravel these roles in compound null mutants have met limited success. Mice

89

null for both Jnk1 and Jnk2 die by embryonic day E11, with evidence of extensive apoptosis

90

in the brain. No specific cardiac abnormalities were noted although some embryos had

91

cardiac dilatation, interpreted to be a non-specific finding [19] although the reason for this

92

interpretation is unclear.

93
94

The zebrafish has become established as an important pre-clinical model, especially in

95

developmental studies, because of the high degree of conservation of vertebrate genes and

96

developmental processes. The unique combination of transgenic reporter lines, transparent

97

embryos, and ease of genetic manipulation through morpholino and CRISPR-Cas9 genome

98

editing are practical advantages over other laboratory animals [21]. Zebrafish are particularly

99

useful for cardiovascular developmental studies as they can survive without a functional

100

circulation for up to one week [22]. Although the zebrafish has only a single atrium and

101

ventricle, the initial fundamental processes of vertebrate heart formation are conserved. An

102

initial heart tube forms from first heart field (FHF) progenitors and further addition of second

103

heart field (SHF) progenitors augment the ventricular mass and atrium [21]. Thus, although

104

not septated, the zebrafish ventricle contains a proximal FHF derived portion that is

105

equivalent to the FHF derived left ventricle and a distal SHF derived component which is the

106

equivalent to the right ventricle [23, 24]. A complicating factor in zebrafish genetics is a

107

genome duplication event [25], such that some genes persist as duplicated paralogs, often

108

with sub-functionalisation and different expression patterns. For example, there is only one

109

persisting functional gene for jnk2 and jnk3, but jnk1 remains duplicated as jnk1a and jnk1b.

110
111

In this study we have uncovered the role of jnk1 in heart development using zebrafish to

112

overcome embryonic death which has limited mouse studies. These studies show

113

developmental stage and tissue level changes in jnk1 transcripts brought about by

114

differential gene expression and alternative splicing. Using both CRISPR null mutants and

115

morpholinos we show a specific requirement for jnk1a in development of the FHF-derived

116

ventricle; the evolutionary equivalent of the left ventricle in man. Moreover, we show that

117

only one specific evolutionarily conserved alternative splice transcript is responsible for this

118

role and that its production is associated only with jnk1a, as a result of sub-specialisation.

Results

122
123

Bioinformatic analysis of the duplicated zebrafish genome suggests sub-

124

functionalisation of jnk1

125

We used the zebrafish to understand the developmental roles of jnk genes in vertebrate

126

cardiac morphogenesis. Initial bioinformatic analysis of the zebrafish genome using Ensembl

127

(assembly GRCz11) [26] indicated that the zebrafish jnk1a and jnk1b genes are paralogs

128

and orthologs of human JNK1 (Figure 1A, B). Expression studies in mice [19,20] show that

129

Jnk2 is widely and strongly expressed throughout the developing embryo and Jnk3 is

130

reported to be expressed in the heart. Before concentrating on jnk1 function we examined

131

the expression of jnk2 and jnk3 in embryonic development. We noted a similar broad

132

expression pattern of jnk2 in developing zebrafish as described in mouse (Figure 1C).

133

Expression of jnk3 was limited to the developing central nervous system at 24 hours post

134

fertilisation (hpf) and we were not able to show jnk3 expression in the developing zebrafish

135

heart by wholemount in-situ hybridisation (WISH) (Figure 1C). These findings were

136

confirmed by RT-PCR of extracted hearts, with jnk3 transcripts clearly detected at 48 hpf but

137

only weak expression of jnk3 detected at 24 hpf. jnk2 was detected at both time points

138

(Figure 1D). We therefore focussed our attention on jnk1a and jnk1b expression and in

139

particular wanted to look at expression of alternatively spliced transcript variants

140

Expression of jnk1 has been reported in zebrafish [27] but at that time the gene duplication

141

was not recognised, and the presence of alternative spliced transcripts not attempted. In

142

order to examine the spatial-temporal expression of these jnk1 paralogues, we firstly sub-

143

cloned jnk1a and jnk1b transcripts from pooled whole embryos at 24, 48 and 72 hpf and

144

analysed their sequence, revealing conservation of the alternative splicing patterns seen in

145

human JNK1. Each gene revealed four transcript variants indicating alternative exon 7/8

146

usage and an alternative splice re-entry site encoding short (Sh) and long (Lg) C-terminal

147

peptides (Figure 1E and sequences in Supplementary Table 2). The splicing events required

148

to produce these transcripts correspond to exon 6a/6b alternative splicing and the p46 or

149

p54 C-terminal extension variants of human JNK1 [11]. Comparison of the predicted

150

zebrafish jnk1a/jnk1b peptides with human JNK1 peptides [28] suggested the potential for

151

sub-functionalisation. The zebrafish jnk1a gene, but not the jnk1b, was capable of producing

152

Ex7 Lg and Ex7 Sh products, equivalent to human JNK1 Ex6a p46 and p54 C-terminal

153

extension variants. In complementary fashion, jnk1b appeared capable of producing an Ex8

154

Sh peptide comparable with the human JNK1 Ex6b p46 variant. However, neither jnk1

155

zebrafish gene produced a product typical of the human JNK1 Ex6b p54 splice variant.

156

Specifically, the exon 8 peptide of the zebrafish jnk1a was not well conserved in comparison

157

with human JNK1 exon 6b peptide and, although the jnk1b Ex8 peptide was conserved, the

158

C-terminal peptide extension provided by jnk1b was extremely divergent from the human C-

159

terminal extension (Figure 1F).

160
161

Specific jnk1a splice variants may play a role in early ventricular morphogenesis

162

To understand the implications of the jnk1a-jnk1b gene duplication event we attempted a

163

spatiotemporal analysis of all eight transcripts by WISH. Riboprobes based on the full-length

164

transcripts were used in high-stringency conditions. As expected, high levels of jnk1a and

165

jnk1b transcripts were expressed throughout the developing brain. Despite the degree of

166

similarity between each of the gene products, it was possible to identify different expression

167

patterns corresponding to the different transcripts, particularly in the developing heart (Figure

168

2A and Supplementary Figure 1). At 24 hpf: jnk1a Ex8 Lg; jnk1b Ex8 Sh; and jnk1b Ex8 Lg

169

were expressed in the heart as well as throughout the developing head structures (Figure 2

170

B-D). One specific jnk1a splice variant, jnk1a Ex7 Lg, was strongly and specifically

171

expressed solely in the developing heart at 24 hpf (Figure 2A). By 48 hpf this transcript was

172

clearly localised to the proximal, rather than distal, part of the developing ventricular

173

chamber, with some localised expression in the adjacent part of the developing atrium.

174
175

Expression profile of jnk transcripts different between heart and whole embryo

176

To confirm this expression and provide quantitative data, we designed a semi-quantitative

177

RT-PCR/restriction enzyme assay to measure the relative expression of the individual jnk1a

178

and jnk1b alternatively spliced transcripts (Figure 2E). This was based on RT-PCR to identify

179

exon 7/8 usage and then a restriction digest to determine the fraction of each PCR product

180

relating to short or long C-terminal extension (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 2 for

181

validation of assay) [29]. Between fertilisation and the onset of gastrulation, 80% of jnk1

182

transcripts originated from the jnk1a gene. However, after this jnk1b transcripts became

183

increasingly abundant and by 120 hpf, 80% of jnk1 transcript originated from jnk1b (Figure

184

2F). Throughout this phase of development, the majority of jnk1a transcripts encoded for the

185

long C-terminal form with equal representation of exons 7 and 8 containing transcripts

186

(Figure 2G). In contrast, the majority of jnk1b transcripts contained exon 8 and were of the

187

short C-terminal form. These data are dominated by the forming brain and somites as major

188

sites of jnk1 expression in the early embryo. To understand which transcripts are specifically

189

important in heart development we isolated whole hearts [31] at key embryonic stages. The

190

transcript assay was performed on hearts extracted at 32 hpf, when the linear heart tube has

191

formed from first heart field (FHF) precursors, but before significant addition of the second

192

heart field (SHF) cells [23,32]. This was compared with 48 hpf and 72 hpf, timepoints when

193

addition of the second heart field is complete [23,32]. The proportion of transcripts

194

represented by the jnk1a gene within the heart paralleled the changes observed in the whole

195

embryo, with falling levels of jnk1a ex7 Lg, and lower, but maintained, levels of jnk1a ex8 Lg

196

(Figure 2H). In contrast, whilst jnk1b Ex8 Sh had become the most abundant transcript in the

197

entire embryo, its levels gradually fell within the heart and by 72 hpf, jnk1b Ex7 Sh was the

198

most abundant transcript.

199
200

jnk1a and jnk1b mutants appear overtly normal

201

To understand the functions of jnk1 in heart development we designed translation-blocking

202

morpholino oligonucleotides to knock down production of jnk1a and jnk1b protein and

203

created jnk1a and jnk1b null mutants using CRISPR-Cas9 (Figure 3 A, B). Although jnk1a

204

morphants appeared normal, approximately 50% of jnk1b morphants exhibited curling of the

205

tail and a similar percentage of jnk1a/jnk1b morphants exhibited minor pericardial oedema.

206

Experiments were carried out using 1ng jnk1b MO and 2ng jnk1a MO as these were the

207

minimal dosages that produced the abnormalities later identified in the mutant lines (see

208

below), without any evidence of off target effects. For the mutants, after initial outcrossing,

209

heterozygotes were in-crossed and resulted in zygotic (Z) null mutants that were fertile and

210

of normal appearance. These could then be in-crossed and maintained as homozygous

211

maternal zygotic (MZ) null lines, where eggs contained no maternally deposited jnk mRNA.

212

Null mutations were confirmed both by sequencing genomic DNA (Figure 3A, B) and

213

demonstration of nonsense mediated decay by RT-PCR (Figure 3C) in MZ null mutants.

214

MZjnk1a, MZjnk1b and MZjnk1a/MZjnk1b zebrafish appeared grossly normal with normal

215

behaviour and fertility (Figure 3D).

216
217

Hypoplastic first heart field ventricular segment

218

The highly specific expression pattern of jnk1a Ex7 Lg (Figure 2A) led us to examine heart

219

development in more detail. The early stages of vertebrate heart development are

220

conserved, including: formation of the initial heart tube from FHF cardiomyocytes;

221

asymmetrical remodelling; and addition of cardiomyocytes derived from the SHF. Formation

222

of the initial heart tube by migrating FHF cardiomyocytes is complete by 28-30 hpf.

223

Immunolabeling of the heart chambers at that time indicated that the ventricular chamber

224

was reduced in size in MZjnk1a mutants and 2ng jnk1a morphants at 28 hpf. However, there

225

was no apparent change in MZjnk1b mutants and jnk1b morphants and furthermore no

226

additional size reduction in MZjnk1a/MZjnk1b double mutants (Figure 4A).

227

The first morphological evidence of left-right asymmetrical remodelling in vertebrates is

228

manifest as jogging of the heart tube. In most normal zebrafish embryos, the heart tube

229

extends from the midline towards the left side of the body, whereas in 1-2% of wildtype

230

embryos this jogging is reversed or hearts lie in the midline. Then, looping of the heart tube

231

places the atrium to the left side of the ventricle but again, in 1-2% of normal embryos this is

232

reversed, or the chambers remain orientated in the midline. In the MZjnk1a, MZjnk1b,

233

MZjnk1a/MZjnk1b mutants and jnk1a morphants, there was no significant difference in

234

looping disturbance at 48 hpf (Figure 4B). However, a small degree of jogging and looping

235

disturbance was noted in jnk1b morphants at the same stage; further analyses regarding the

236

role of jnk in left-right patterning is described elsewhere (Santos-Ledo et al; in preparation).

237

Following formation of the initial heart tube and concomitant with asymmetrical remodelling is

238

the continued addition of SHF cells to the heart tube. In birds and mammals with septated

239

hearts SHF cells form the right ventricle, but in the zebrafish, which maintains a single

240

unseptated ventricle, the SHF cells add to the distal part of the common ventricle [23,24,32].

241

To fully assess the size of the FHF and SHF atrial ventricular components we counted the

242

number of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes within the heart at 28 hpf, when the FHF

243

cells have added but the SHF cells have not, and at 56 hpf when the SHF accretion is

244

complete but growth by replication of CMCs has not yet begun. In 2ng jnk1a morphants

245

there was a 15% reduction in the number of ventricular cardiomyocytes within the heart at 28

246

hpf (Figure 4 C, D). At 56 hpf, the number of CMCs was increased equally in both control

247

and jnk1a morphant ventricles indicating that the SHF accretion was unaffected by jnk1a

248

knockdown, and the reduction in ventricular size was less apparent (Figure 4C, D). Analysis

249

of MZjnk1a mutants at the same stages indicated a 26% reduction in ventricular

250

cardiomyocytes at 28 hpf. There was no significant reduction in MZjnk1b mutants and no

251

additional reduction in MZjnk1a/MZjnk1b compared to MZjnk1a mutants (Figure 4E). To

252

confirm that there was normal addition of SHF progenitors to the heart tube we used a

253

zebrafish line expressing the photoconvertible kikGR reporter under the control of the myh7

254

promoter [23]. Photo-conversion of kikGR at 20 hpf identifies FHF cardiomyocytes, in which

255

the myh7 promoter is already active, and allows them to be distinguished from SHF CMCs

256

that only later activate the myh7 promoter and thus only exhibit non-photoconverted protein

257

[23]. Analysis at 50 hpf showed that here was no difference between jnk1a morpholino

258

treated embryos and controls (Figure 4 F,G).

259

We asked if there might be functional consequences from this significant and localised

260

deficiency of FHF ventricular cardiomyocytes. We therefore examined heart function at 72

261

hpf in control and MZjnk1a mutant embryos. Using video microscopy it was evident that the

262

FHF ventricular component, adjacent to the atrioventricular valve, was of reduced size and

263

hypokinetic in the MZjnk1a mutant compared with their control counterparts (Figure 4H)

264

leading to a reduction in ventricular fractional shortening (Figure 4I). There was also a

265

reduction in heart rate in the mutant embryos (Figure 4J).

266
267

In order to confirm that the defects in formation of the FHF ventricular component were

268

specific to jnk1a knockdown, and to establish whether they related specifically to any of the

269

isoforms, the four jnk1a transcripts: Ex7 Sh; Ex7 Lg; Ex8 Sh; and Ex8 Lg were evaluated

270

with regard to their ability to rescue the ventricular cardiomyocyte deficit at 28 hpf (Figure

271

4H). One cell-stage embryos were injected simultaneously with the jnk1a morpholino and

272

100pg capped mRNA corresponding to the individual transcripts. Only the jnk1a Ex7 Lg

273

transcript was able to fully rescue the FHF cardiomyocyte deficit and the effect was still

274

evident at 56 hpf (Figure 4I). None of the other three jnk1a transcripts, separately or in

275

combination, were able to do this. These data suggest that jnk1a Ex7 Lg is specifically

276

required to produce the normal FHF derived ventricular component, the equivalent of the left

277

ventricle in septated hearts.

278
279

Mechanism of FHF ventricular cardiomyocyte deficiency

280

To understand how disruption of jnk1a function might lead to this specific deficiency of FHF

281

ventricular cardiomyocytes, we followed the development of cardiomyocytes from their

282

appearance in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) to their coalescence to the

283

primary heart tube. At the 8-somite stage (ss) cells in the parasagittal ALPM express the key

284

transcriptional regulators nkx2.5, hand2 and gata5. In jnk1a morphants the expression

285

patterns of these genes all appeared normal (Figure 5A). Whilst the expression pattern of

286

these genes includes other non-cardiomyocyte cells, ventricular cardiomyocytes could be

287

specifically detected by ventricular specific myosin (myh7) expression at 15ss (Figure 5B). At

288

this point there was no difference between the expression patterns of jnk1a morphants and

289

controls. However, at 18ss the expression pattern of myh7 revealed midline convergence of

290

ventricular cardiomyocytes occurring in control embryos, but not jnk1a morphants.

291

Subsequently, at 22ss, there was incomplete formation of the cardiac cone in the morphants,

292

and at 24 hpf the heart tube appeared poorly extended (Figure 5B). To exclude

293

developmental delay as a cause of the failure to form the heart cone in the jnk1a morphants,

294

we immunolabelled the forming trunk myotomes with MF20 antibody between 16 and 30 hpf.

This demonstrated no difference in the number of myotomes in jnk1a morphants when

compared with control embryos when assessed at 14ss (13 hpf), 18ss (17 hpf) or at 30hpf.

cell division. To identify cell that are proliferating during this phase we carried out BrdU

301

pulsing at 16ss in myl7:kikGR embryos treated with jnk1a morpholino or mismatch control

302

morpholino and assayed for incorporation at 28hpf. There was no difference in proliferative

303

activity between cardiomyocytes from jnk1a morphants and controls (Figure 5E). Similarly,

304

using myl7:kikGR in combination with acridine orange, there was no evidence of increased

305

programmed cell or necrotic death within the heart between the morphants and the control

306

embryos (Figure 5F).

307

To evaluate this abnormal cardiomyocyte migration behaviour in more detail, we carried out

308

time-lapse confocal imaging of cardiomyocytes labelled with myl7:gfp between the 16ss and

309

20ss as they migrated from the ALPM to the midline and coalesce to form the heart cone.

310

Close examination revealed that the migration of cardiomyocytes to the heart cone was

311

disturbed. Tracking individual CMCs indicated the mean velocity of cells as they migrated to

312

the heart cone was reduced in jnk1a morphants (Figure 6D) and this was because the

313

cardiomyocytes took a more wandering path (Figure 6E). These abnormal behaviours were

314

improved by co-injection of jnk1a Ex7 Lg mRNA, increasing their velocity (Figure 6D) and

315

normalising the directional component of migration (Figure 6E).

Discussion

319

Our understanding of heart morphogenesis and the developmental basis of congenital heart

320

malformations is now underpinned by the concept of the first and second heart fields. The

321

addition of SHF progenitors to the FHF-derived heart tube provides cardiac structures

322

required for breathing air (i.e. the septated heart with a pulmonary circulation), but the

323

presence of the SHF in zebrafish is proof that the SHF predates the evolutionary emergence

324

of these structures [23,24,30,33].

325
326

In this study we have found that a reduction in the FHF cardiomyocyte contribution to the

327

zebrafish ventricle occurs when jnk1a gene expression is abrogated and that the reduction is

328

completely and specifically rescued by the highly conserved jnk1a Ex7 Lg alternative spliced

329

transcript. Whilst the same findings in both jnk1a morphants and MZ null mutants, together

330

with the highly specific mRNA rescue are compelling, suggesting that Jnk1a plays a

331

fundamental role in FHF cardiogenesis, Jnk1 null mouse embryos are not reported to have a

332

cardiac phenotype [18,19]. However, close examination of published images indicates that

333

Jnk1/Jnk2 null (double mutant) mouse embryos harvested at E11.5 appear to have ceased

334

development at E9.5, and to have a hypoplastic ventricle [19]. Detailed re-analysis of the

335

Jnk1, and ideally Jnk1/Jnk2 double null mouse embryos will be important to clarify this.

336

Despite the lack of compensation from SHF cardiomyocytes, the reduction in the FHF-

337

derived ventricular component is well tolerated by the MZjnk1a mutants. This is probably

338

because the FHF and SHF addition add to the same chamber in fish. Notably, however, the

339

deficiency can still be observed at 72 hpf by akinesia of the FHF-derived segment of the

340

ventricle and reduced heart rate, which has been shown to be due to disturbed coupling

341

between the heart field components [24]. In vertebrates with a septated heart, this 25%

342

reduction in cardiomyocytes would be expected to be clinically apparent, as a hypoplastic

343

left ventricle.

344
345

Despite the simplicity of the developing zebrafish heart that permits counting of individual

346

cardiomyocytes, it is not easy to determine when or why a small group of FHF ventricular

347

cardiomyocytes might be lost. Expression patterns of transcriptional regulators in the ALPM

348

mark both ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes, but also endothelial and haemopoietic

349

lineages. Moreover, there is a small degree of cardiomyocyte proliferation during migration

350

through the ALPM to the heart [31]. It is perhaps therefore not surprising that our WISH and

351

proliferation assays are not sensitive enough to detect a reduction that affects less than 12

352

cells. Similarly, the death of a handful of cells is also difficult to determine over a window of

353

migration from 16 hpf to 28 hpf. Importantly, we have shown that the migratory pattern of

354

cardiomyocytes is disturbed in the absence of Jnk1a. A role for Jnk1 in cell movement is

355

widely recognised in the metastatic spread of cancer [34] and is required in Schwann cell

356

migration [35], dependent on paxillin at focal adhesions [36]. It is possible to imagine that

357

some cells may become lost during migration, and in isolation undergo cell death or

358

differentiate into other tissues. Other studies demonstrating perturbance in FHF/SHF

359

complements [24, 37] have similarly not identified where or how cells are lost.

360
361

It has been suggested that in certain cell types, Jnk may activate AP1 and related factors

362

[38]. In zebrafish it has been shown that AP1 disturbance affects only the SHF ventricular

363

cardiomyocyte addition [37]. Hence jnk1a is unlikely to be acting through AP1 in this FHF

364

context. Hand2 is known to control numbers of cardiomyocytes in both the FHF and SHF

365

[39] and it is possible that jnk1a may be acting to augment the transcription or activity of this

366

or an interacting transcriptional activator. Similarly, although Jnk has been implicated in the

367

convergent extension movements regulated by the non-canonical Wnt PCP signalling

368

pathway in Drosophila [40], Xenopus [41] and zebrafish [42], it appears that at least in

369

zebrafish, jnk1 may play a lesser role than jnk2 [42] or jnk3, which may explain the lack of

370

any overt PCP phenotype in our MZjnk1a/MZjnk1b mutants. Alternatively, there may be

371

compensatory upregulation from other genes as our jnk mutants exhibit nonsense mediated

decay (NSMD) [43]. Although we attempted pharmacological inhibition of NSMD with ethyl 2-

373

{[(6,7-dimethyl-3-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-quinoxalinyl)acetyl]amino}-4,5-dimethyl-3-

374

thiophenecarboxylate [43] this agent was highly toxic and severely disturbed embryonic

375

development when used within the first 24 hpf of development, which prevented examination

376

for a more profound reduction in cardiomyocyte numbers. We can say, however, that there is

377

no compensation from jnk1b transcripts as there was no additional reduction in

378

cardiomyocytes in MZjnk1a/MZjnk1b mutants, and a greater reduction in cardiomyocytes

379

was seen in jnk1a mutants (25%) than morphants (15%).

380
381

In the adult cardiovascular system, Jnk1 provides an important stress response to pressure

382

overload [44] and both Jnk1 and Jnk2 have been implicated in the development of

383

atheromatous plaques [45,46]. Our RT-PCR splicing analysis indicates that jnk1b transcripts

384

become dominant in the maturing heart and it will be interesting to see whether these are

385

up-regulated in myocardial injury as part of a stress response, or if jnk1a Ex7 Lg is

386

upregulated as part of a regenerative response. However, no roles for Jnk in the developing

387

heart have been previously reported. The highly specific FHF ventricular hypoplasia

388

phenotype in zebrafish is the equivalent of left ventricular hypoplasia in the human heart.

389

Clinically this is often recognised in conjunction with other abnormalities and presumed to be

390

a secondary consequence, e.g. double outlet right ventricle (DORV), atrioventricular septal

391

defect and total anomalous pulmonary venous connections. Isolated left ventricular

392

hypoplasia is a key feature of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), where the causes and

393

developmental origins remain obscure [47]. Although abnormalities of the aortic valve have

394

been suggested as a primary abnormality in HLHS, it is also possible that a primary failure of

395

left ventricular growth could be responsible. Although easily confused with left ventricular

396

hypoplasia with DORV, HLHS is a condition in which the aorta and pulmonary artery are

397

normally connected to each ventricle of the heart [48]. Until these findings are modelled in

398

mouse it is unclear whether Jnk1 containing genetic pathways contain candidates for HLHS,

399

or as with other PCP genes, double outlet right ventricle [6].

400
401

The importance of alternative splicing for regulating specific developmental processes

402

remains underexplored. Whilst it has been shown to be important for regulating embryonic

403

aspects of stem cell pluripotency and differentiation [49, 50] and has been shown to be

404

common in the early mouse embryo [51] and in the zebrafish [52], there are few, if any,

405

reports where specific splice variants have been shown to play a discrete mechanistic role

406

during embryogenesis that is unique to that transcript and not shared with other related

407

transcripts. There is tantalising circumstantial evidence in the literature to support the idea

408

that individual transcripts may be specifically activated by different gene networks, for

409

example the phosphatase DUSP8 preferentially inactivates exon 6a-containing (equivalent

410

of Ex7 in zebrafish) JNK1 peptides [53]. In this study we have comprehensively shown

411

developmental and organ specific splicing changes within the duplicated and highly

412

conserved gene jnk1. Importantly, we have shown the balance of Ex7 and Ex8 expression in

413

developing embryos is not random, as has been suggested previously [11]. Furthermore, we

414

have shown that there is a functional interaction between central exon usage and C-terminal

415

splicing, as only jnk1a mRNA containing both Ex7 and C-terminal Lg extensions can rescue

416

ventricular hypoplasia. Taken together these studies show the importance of studying

417

specific alternatively spliced transcripts in cardiac development and indicate the power of the

418

zebrafish model to uncover specific and biomedically-relevant malformations, such as left

419

ventricular hypoplasia. Population based genomic studies have been remarkably poor at

420

discovering genetic disturbances that produce non-syndromic congenital heart disease. This

421

study may suggest that the functional diversity afforded by alternative splicing and the

422

regulatory mechanisms that may not immediately recognised as heart specific, may hold the

423

key to understanding cardiac malformation.

Materials and Methods

426
427

Animals

428

Zebrafish were maintained in standard conditions [54] under the Animals (Scientific

429

Procedures) Act 1986, United Kingdom, project license PPL6004548 and conformed to

430

Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament. All experiments were approved by the

431

Newcastle University Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board. Embryos were obtained

432

from natural pairwise mating, reared in in E3 embryo medium at 28.5°C and staged by

433

somite counting [55]. Embryos were treated with 1-phenyl 2-thiourea (PTU) from 24 hours

434

post fertilisation (hpf) to suppress pigmentation as needed.

435
436

Morpholino and mRNA injections

437

All injections were performed at the 1 cell stage. At 2 hpf non-fertilized or grossly abnormal

438

embryos were discarded. Unless otherwise stated, 2ng of jnk1a morpholino, 1ng of jnk1b

439

morpholino or 2ng of control morpholino were injected per embryo in each experiment (See

440

Supplementary Table 1 for morpholino sequences).

441
442

Mutants

443

Null mutant jnk1a and jnk1b zebrafish were made using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated

444

mutagenesis [56] in the AB wildtype line with guide RNA identified using CRISPRscan [57].

445

Screening and subsequent genotyping was carried out by demonstrating disruption of a

446

specific restriction site (jnk1a: EcorV and jnk1b: MwoI; see Supplementary Table 1).

447

Mutations were confirmed by sequencing and outcrossing of lines.

448
449

Cloning of alternatively spliced transcripts

450

Embryos at 24-72 hpf were pooled and RNA extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies)

451

permitting generation of cDNA using Superscript III and oligo-dT primers. Alternatively

452

spliced transcripts were identified by sub-cloning and sequencing of colonies (see

453

Supplementary Table 1 for primer sequences). Transcripts for use in morpholino rescue

454

experiments were produced using degenerate primers with at least 5 mismatches respect to

455

the original cDNA (see Supplementary Table 1) and expressed using the zebrafish Gateway

456

plasmid system [58]. RNA was produced using the SP6 Ambion mMessage mMachine kit

457

(ThermoFisher Scientific). Unless otherwise stated 100pg of RNA were used in the rescue

458

experiments.

461

Semi quantitative RT-PCR splicing assay

462

Total RNA was extracted from 30-50 pooled embryos or 50 beating hearts [59] and cDNA

463

produced as above. RT-PCR reactions for jnk1a Ex7 or Ex8 and jnk1b Ex7 or Ex8 were

464

performed in triplicate with Go-taq G2 polymerase (Promega) using conditions: 95°C (2 min),

465

[95°C (30 sec), 64°C (30 sec), 72°C (30 sec)] x 35 cycles, 72° (5 min). These conditions

466

ensured products obtained were within the linear phase of PCR (Supplementary Figure 2).

467

Primers are indicated in Supplementary Table 1. Products were visualised on a 2% agarose

468

gel and gel densitometry carried out using Fiji [60]. Aliquots of each PCR product were

469

purified by ethanol and sodium acetate precipitation and resuspended in 10µl of nuclease-

470

free water prior to restriction enzyme digestion. Digestion for 1 hour at 37° was carried out

471

with StyI-HF (jnk1a) and NheI-HF (jnk1b) and gel densitometry performed. These values

472

were normalized against the ef1α value and with regard to the efficiency of the PCR reaction

473

as established with plasmids containing full length transcripts (Supplementary Figure 2).

474
475

Wholemount in-situ hybridisation

476

Full-length jnk1a and jnk1b alternatively spliced transcripts were used to generate

477

riboprobes. For jnk2 and jnk3 an 1100 amplicon was selected. In addition: hand2, nkx2.5,

478

vmhc (Deborah Yelon, UCSF, USA), gata4 (Roger Patient, Oxford University, UK),

479

480

Chromogenic in situ hybridization was performed according to established protocols [61].

481
482

Immunohistochemistry

483

Whole-mount immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described [62]. Primary

484

antibodies: chicken anti-GFP (1/500; ab13970, Abcam), mouse anti MF20 (1/10; MYH1,

485

DSHB), mouse anti S46 (1/10; MYHCA, DSHB), rabbit anti Mef2 (1/100; ab646444, Abcam),

Cardiomyocyte quantification

494

Cardiomyocyte nuclei were identified by immunolabelling with Mef2 antibody at 28 hpf [33]

497

nuclei to be imaged in the same focal plane and manual counting was performed using Fiji

498

[60]. To differentiate the first heart field cardiomyocyte complement from the second heart

499

field accretion we used we used myh7:kikGR transgenic line injected with either mismatch

500

control or jnk1a morpholino. Embryos were exposed to UV light at 20hpf, photoconverting all

501

cardiomyocytes already expressing kikGR from green to red emitting forms. Imaging and

502

quantification were performed as before.

503
504

Live imaging of embryonic heart activity

505

Embryos were orientated in 1% low melting point agarose containing 0.2% Tricaine. Movies

506

were taken on an inverted microscope with DIC (Nikon Diaphot) using a high-speed digital

507

video camera (640x480 pixels at 127 frames/sec) (Multipix Imaging, Hampshire, UK). Data

508

was analysed using Fiji [60] and M-mode obtained by reslice through the image series.

509
510

Proliferation assay

511

Control or jnk1a morphant embryos (myh7:gfp) were incubated in 10mM BrdU (B5002,

512

Sigma) in 15% DMSO for 30 min on ice at 16 somites. Then, embryos were washed in E3

513

medium and allowed to develop until 28 hpf. After fixing in PFA 4% overnight at 4°C,

514

embryos were dehydrated and stored in methanol at -20°C until further use. Embryos were

515

rehydrated in PBS, then permeabilized using Proteinase K and post-fixed in PFA 4%. After

516

incubation in 2N HCl for 1 hour, standard IHC using anti BrdU and anti GFP antibodies was

517

carried out. The proportion of BrdU positive cardiomyocytes was assessed as above.

518
519

Cell death

520

Embryos from the myh7:kikgr line were injected with either control or jnk1a morpholino and

521

incubated in 10µg/ml of acridine orange during the phase of migration from ALPM to the

522

cardiac cone. As acridine orange is visualised in the FITC fluorescent channel,

523

photoconversion of kikGR in FHF cardiomyocytes allowed identification of cardiomyocyte

524

nuclei using the TRITC channel. As above, acridine orange positive cardiomyocytes were

525

quantified using Fiji [60].

526
527

Cardiomyocyte tracking

528

An established protocol [63] with minor modification was used to track the migration of the

529

cardiomyocytes from the anterolateral plate mesoderm to the cardiac cone. myh7:gfp

530

embryos at the 14 somite stage (ss) were hand dechorionated and oriented in 1.5% low

531

melting agarose. A 20-image stack (A1R confocal Microscope, Nikon), using a 20x objective

532

at 3um intervals, was acquired every 6 minutes between 15-16 ss to 19-20 ss. Manual

tracking was performed using Fiji [60] and XY coordinates of individual cardiomyocytes were

534

established for every time point. Based on these coordinates we calculated the following

Statistics

549

Where possible, sample size was determined with regard to normal values and standard

550

deviations described in previously published experiments. In all cases at least three

551

independent experiments, using embryos from three different clutches of eggs, were

552

performed. Statistics were performed using Graphpad Prism7 for Mac OSX, version 6.0c

553

(Graphpad Software Inc, USA) and, depending on the number of groups to compare, either

554

Student t test or ANOVA was performed.

Figure 1 Human JNK1 is conserved in zebrafish, although duplicated as jnk1a and jnk1b. (A) Despite
different exon numbering i.e. 6a/6b in human and 7/8 in zebrafish orthologues, exon structure is
entirely conserved. (B) jnk1a, jnk1b and JNK1 lie in syntenic chromosomal regions. (C) WISH
demonstrated expression of jnk2 and jnk3 in the developing brain (arrows) but not heart
(arrowheads). (D) RT-PCR of extracted hearts indicates late onset of jnk3 gene expression. (E)
Cartoon showing all zebrafish jnk1a/b transcripts resulting from alternate exon 7/8 usage and
differing C-terminal extension. (F) Translation of zebrafish jnk1a and jnk1b transcripts indicates
conservation and subspecialisation of zebrafish jnk1a and jnk1b with human JNK1 peptides when
allowance for favourable (green text) or neutral (grey text) amino acid substitutions [38]. Amino
acids coded by exon 7 within jnk1a match those in human exon 6a, but jnk1b lacks a conserved
serine residue (*). In reciprocal fashion, exon 8 in jnk1b encodes a conserved threonine residue seen
in JNK1 exon 6b, whilst jnk1a codes for serine in exon 8 (**). The short C-terminal peptide sequence
was completely conserved between the species. The C-terminal extension seen in jnk1a was almost
identical to the human, but the jnk1b extension differed by 9/39 amino acids including insertion of
an additional threonine residue.
Figure 2. Expression of jnk1a/b transcripts in development. (A-D) Expression patterns of the four
jnk1 transcripts most highly expressed in the heart (arrows) at 24hfp (i, iii), 48hpf (ii, iv) from lateral
(i, ii) and left oblique views (iii, iv). (A) jnk1a Ex7 Lg is expressed in the cardiac cone (arrow) at 24hpf.
At 48hpf strong expression is seen in the proximal part of the cardiac ventricle (v; black arrow) and
weak expression in some cells in the outer curvature of the atrium (a; white arrow). (B) jnk1a Ex8 Lg
is expressed at low level in in both the atrium and ventricle. (C) At 24hpf jnk1b ex8 Sh expression in
the cardiac cone is difficult to determine due to expression in overlapping head structures (C i, III),
but is clearly seen in the outflow tract (arrow), and lower level in the ventricle, by 48hpf (C ii-iv). (D)
jnk1b Ex8 Lg is expressed in the region of the heart but is also expressed in surrounding tissues. (E-H)
Semi-quantitative jnk1a/b transcript assay. (E) Schematic of assay for jnk1a (see methods for full
details). RNA is extracted and a cDNA pool produced. PCR within linear phase performed using
forward (fwd) primers specific for jnk1a/1b exons 7/8 and common reverse (rev) primers. The
fraction with C-terminal extension is determined by restriction enzyme (RE) digestion. (F)
Percentage of total jnk1a and jnk1b transcripts during embryonic development. 14 ss = 16 hpf. (G)
Proportion of each individual alternatively spliced transcript during development in whole embryo.
(H) Proportion of each individual transcript within isolated whole heart during development. jnk1a =
blue, jnk1b = green, Ex7 = circle, Ex8 = square, black outline = Sh and no outline = Lg.
Figure 3. Rationale for jnk1 mutants and morphants. Sequences of genomic DNA for jnk1a (A) and
jnk1b (B) showing: relative position of translational blocking morpholino oligonucleotides (ATG
underlined); targeting sequence for CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA; deletions produced; translated peptide
sequence (* = stop); and restriction enzymes that identify mutants. Both jnk1a and jnk1b mutations
disrupt sequence within exon 6 and lead to loss of all four alternatively spliced transcripts. (C) RTPCR using primers specific for jnk1a and jnk1b exon 7 and 8 demonstrate nonsense-mediated decay.

approximately 50% of jnk1b 1ng morphant displays tail curling (*) and some jnk1a 2ng/jnk1b 1ng
morphants additionally display mild pericardial oedema (arrow).
Figure 4. Ventricular hypoplasia in jnk1a knockdown. (A) Cardiac morphology at 28 hpf. All
ventricular cardiomyocytes are labelled by MF20 antibody (red) and atrial cells by both MF20 and
S46 antibody (appear yellow). Normal appearances seen in embryos exposed to 2ng mismatch
morpholino (mmMO). Ventricular hypoplasia (shown by size of white bar) is seen in embryos
injected with 2ng jnk1a morpholino, but not in those treated with 1ng jnk1b morpholino. Maternal
zygotic (MZ) jnk1a null mutants have a comparable degree of ventricular hypoplasia, which is not
seen in MZjnk1b. There is no additional ventricular hypoplasia in MZjnk1a/MZjnk1b double mutants.
(B) Minimal levels of disordered cardiac looping in MZjnk1a and MZjnk1b mutants, alone and in
combination. There is no increase in cardiac looping abnormalities in jnk1a 2ng MO treated embryos.
(C) Quantification of cardiomyocytes within the developing heart. Embryos at 28 hpf treated with
2ng mmMO or 2ng jnk1a MO immunolabelled with mef2 antibody which identifies all cardiomyocyte
nuclei at this stage, and S46 antibody which identifies atrial cells. Hypoplasia of the FHF-derived
ventricular segment is obvious at 28 hpf (line). (D,E) In embryos treated with 2ng jnk1a MO there is a
reduction in ventricular cardiomyocytes at 28 hpf before, and at 52 hpf after, completion of the SHF
cardiomyocyte accretion. Although there are increased numbers of cardiomyocytes at 56 hpf, this
difference remains. There is no change in the numbers of atrial cardiomyocytes. The same reduction
in FHF-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes is seen in MZjnk1a mutants at 28 hpf but not in MZjnk1b
mutants and there is no change in severity of this phenotype when jnk1a and jnk1b are both absent.
(F) Confirmation of normal SHF ventricular cardiomyocyte addition at 56hpf. The green dashed line
indicates the extent of the SHF-derived ventricular component whereas the red dashed line indicates
the extent of the FHF-derived ventricular component. (G) numbers of SHF ventricular
cardiomyocytes (H) i) Cardiac contractile function in MZjnk1a mutants. Images from movies (see
supplementary data) with the external margin of the ventricle identified in diastole (yellow dashed
line) and systole (red dashed line). Ventricular contraction is impaired in the FHF-derived ventricular
segment (black arrowhead). Ii) "M-mode" representations of the movies are obtained by resampling
between the yellow arrows. Hypokinesis in the MZjnk1a heart (black arrowhead) can be seen, in
comparison to the normal waveform of contraction in the control heart (black arrow). (I) Reduced
fractional shortening and (J) heart rate in MZjnk1a mutants. (K) Only jnk1a Ex7 Lg mRNA was capable
of rescuing the effects of jnk1a morpholino in reducing the FHF ventricular cardiomyocyte numbers.
(L) jnk Ex7 Lg mRNA does not increase the complement of total FHF and SHF ventricular
cardiomyocytes but is able to reverse the effects of jnk1a MO at 56hpf. * p<0.05, ** p<0.02,

through the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) to form the heart are visualised by WISH for

there is no developmental delay between embryos injected with 2ng mmMO and those injected
with 2ng jnk1a MO. Proliferation (D) and cell death (E) of cardiomyocytes during migration through
ALPM is not reduced in 2ng jnk1a morphants. ns = not significant.
