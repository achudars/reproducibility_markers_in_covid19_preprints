Abstract
Cohesin cofactors regulate the loading, maintenance and release of cohesin complexes from
chromosomes during the mitotic cell cycle but little is known on their role during vertebrate
meiosis. One such cofactor is PDS5, which exists in two versions in somatic and germline
cells, PDS5A and PDS5B, with unclear functional specificity. Here we have analyzed their
distribution and functions in mouse spermatocytes. We show that simultaneous elimination of
PDS5A and PDS5B results in severe defects during prophase I while their individual
depletion does not, suggesting a functional redundancy of the two factors. Shortened
axial/lateral elements and a reduction of early recombination nodules are observed in the
absence of both PDS5 proteins. Moreover, telomere integrity and their association to the
nuclear envelope are severely compromised. As these defects occur without detectable
reduction in chromosome-bound cohesin, we propose that the dynamic behavior of the
complex, mediated by PDS5 proteins, is key for successful completion of meiotic prophase I.

Introduction
Meiosis is a highly specialized cell division process that produces haploid gametes by
performing two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation after a single round of DNA
replication of a diploid genome. The accurate segregation of chromosomes during meiosis
relies on the proper achievement of the preceding processes of homologous chromosome
pairing, synapsis and recombination (Bolcun-Filas and Handel, 2018). Meiotic recombination
initiates in mammals during the leptotene stage of prophase I by the formation of
programmed

DNA

double-strand

breaks

(DSBs)

by

the

endonuclease

SPO11

(Chicheportiche et al., 2007), which leads to phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX at
serine 139 (γ-H2AX) in the surrounding chromatin (Mahadevaiah et al., 2001). After a 5' to 3'
resection of DNA at DSBs, the recombinase RAD51, among others, associates to the 3'
single-stranded DNA and promotes invasion of the double-stranded DNA of the homolog, a
process that facilitates recognition and pairing of the homologs (Grabarz et al., 2012). Some
of these events are finally processed as reciprocal crossovers via the participation of the
DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1 (Moens et al., 2007). Although meiotic recombination
initiates early in meiosis, its resolution takes place in the pachytene stage after the homologs
have achieved synapsis. Synapsis is mediated by the synaptonemal complex (SC), a
tripartite proteinaceous structure specific of meiosis that assembles during prophase I
(Fraune et al., 2012). The SC assembly is initiated in leptotene, when an axial element (AE)
is developed along each homolog over the trajectories of previously loaded cohesin
complexes. During this stage, the telomeres attach to the nuclear envelope (NE), and by
zygotene they adopt a polarized “bouquet” configuration that promotes chromosome
movements essential for accurate homolog pairing (Shibuya and Watanabe, 2014).
Subsequently, the so-called central element (CE) is formed between AEs of the SC. At this
time, the AEs are referred as lateral elements (LEs) and the CE, composed by transverse
filaments, physically connects the LEs of the two homologs. By pachytene, the homologs
have achieved synapsis along their entire length and thus each bivalent presents a fully
developed SC.
During the first and second meiotic divisions, recombined homologs and single
chromatids migrate to opposite spindle poles, respectively, thanks to a sequential loss of arm
and centromere sister-chromatid cohesion (Suja and Barbero, 2009; Ishiguro, 2019).
Cohesion is mediated by ring-shaped cohesin complexes composed of two SMC (Structural
Maintenance of Chromosomes) proteins, SMC1α and SMC3, the kleisin subunit RAD21 and
a STAG/SA subunit that can be SA1 or SA2 in somatic vertebrate cells (Morales and Losada,
2018). The dynamic loading, maintenance and release of cohesin complexes from chromatin
is mediated by cofactor proteins and some posttranslational modifications (Rankin, 2015;

Ouyang and Yu, 2017). The functions of these cofactors have been characterized during the
mitotic cycle, but much less is known of their behavior in meiosis. Once cohesin is loaded on
chromatin in early G1 by the NIPBL-MAU2 heterodimer, PDS5 and WAPL bind to the
complex and promote their dissociation (Tedeschi et al., 2013; Ouyang et al., 2016). During
S phase, as sister chromatids arise from the replication fork, cohesion is established by a
fraction of cohesin complexes that are acetylated in their SMC3 subunit and bound by
Sororin, which counteracts the cohesin releasing activity of WAPL until mitotic prophase
(Shintomi and Hirano, 2009; Nishiyama et al., 2010). Two versions of the PDS5 protein exist
in vertebrate cells, PDS5A and PDS5B, which are required both for cohesin dissociation
together with WAPL and for cohesin stabilization together with Sororin (Losada et al, 2005;
Carretero et al., 2013; Ouyang et al, 2016; Wutz et al., 2017). While the two PDS5 proteins
present these activities, centromeric cohesion defects are more apparent in Pds5B deficient
cells in mitosis (Carretero et al., 2013).
In addition to the canonical cohesin subunits mentioned above, several meiosisspecific subunits have been described during mammalian meiosis. SMC1β and STAG3 are
the paralogs of SMC1α and SA1/2, respectively, while REC8 and RAD21L are the meiotic
counterparts of the kleisin subunit RAD21 (Ishiguro, 2019). The distribution and functions of
the different cohesin subunits during mammalian meiosis has been extensively analyzed. All
of them, both mitotic and meiosis-specific ones, are located at AEs/LEs during mouse
prophase I. Spermatocytes from mouse deficient for the meiosis-specific cohesin subunits
SMC1β (Revenkova et al., 2004; Novak et al., 2008; Adelfalk et al., 2009; Biswas et al.,
2013), REC8 (Bannister et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2005), RAD21L (Herrán et al., 2011), and
STAG3 (Fukuda et al., 2014; Hopkins et al., 2014; Llano et al., 2014; Winters et al., 2014),
arrest at different stages of prophase I and display severe defects in the assembly and
pairing of AEs/LEs, recombination and, in some cases, altered telomere structure. However,
there are few studies describing the dynamics and involvement of cohesin cofactors during
mammalian meiosis. WAPL decorates the AEs/LEs of chromosomes in mouse oocytes
(Zhang et al., 2008) and spermatocytes, where it is involved in the removal of arm cohesion
by the end of prophase I (Brieño-Enríquez et al., 2016). Unexpectedly, Sororin has been
detected at the SC central region, unlike the cohesin subunits and WAPL (Gómez et al.,
2016; Jordan et al., 2017).
The single orthologs of PDS5 in Sordaria macrospora (Spo76p) and budding yeast
are located at AEs/LEs during prophase I stages (van Heemst et al., 1999; Zhang et al.,
2005; Jin et al., 2009). Analyses of meiosis in Pds5 mutants in Sordaria, budding and fission
yeasts, and the worm Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that this protein is involved in
cohesion, formation of AEs/LEs, condensation, homolog pairing and repair of DSBs (van

Heemst et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2006; Jin et al., 2009;
Ding et al., 2016). In mammaliam meiosis, like in mitosis, both PDS5A and PDS5B are
present. While nothing is known about the localization of PDS5A, PDS5B has been detected
at AEs/LEs in mouse spermatocytes (Fukuda and Höög, 2010). In the present study, we
report the distribution of PDS5A and PDS5B during male mouse meiosis. Moreover, taking
advantage of conditional knock out mouse models previously generated (Carretero et al.,
2013), we have analyzed the meiotic phenotype of spermatocytes lacking one or both PDS5
proteins. Our results indicate that a single PDS5 protein, either PDS5A or PDS5B, is
sufficient for prophase I progression. However, their simultaneous elimination results in
drastic meiotic defects including the formation of shortened AEs/LEs, reduced formation of
early recombination nodules, and alterations in the structure of telomeres and their
attachment to the NE during prophase I.

Results
Different localization and dynamics of PDS5A and PDS5B in mouse spermatocytes
We analyzed the distribution of PDS5A and PDS5B proteins on spread mouse
spermatocytes by immunofluorescence using specific antibodies for these proteins (Fig.
S1A-C) and for SYCP3, a structural component of the AEs/LEs, to identify the different
meiotic stages. PDS5A was undetectable during leptotene when SYCP3-labeled AEs started
to organize (Fig. 1A and B), but colocalized with SYCP3 along the synapsing AEs/LEs of
both autosomes and sex chromosomes during zygotene (Fig. 1C and D) and early
pachytene (Fig. 1E and F). By mid pachytene, however, the PDS5A labeling dispersed
throughout the chromatin (Fig. 1G) and was less intense on the sex body (Fig. 1H). In
diplotene, lack of staining was observed around the ends of the desynapsing autosomal LEs
which corresponded to DAPI-positive regions, namely the chromocenters (Fig. 1I-L). This
distribution of PDS5A persisted in diakinesis although the overall signal intensity was slightly
reduced (Fig. 1M and N). By metaphase I PDS5A was found at centromeres (Fig. 1O). In
side-viewed centromeres, PDS5A was present as a T-shaped signal below the closely
associated sister kinetochores stained with ACA (Fig. 1O; bottom inset), while viewed from
the top PDS5A encircled sister kinetochores (Fig. 1O; top inset). This localization is similar to
that of SYCP3 at the inner centromere domain (Parra et al., 2004; Gómez et al., 2007), but
different from that of the meiosis-specific cohesin subunit REC8 which localizes in small
patches along the interchromatid domain at the arms (Fig. 1Q and R). Both PDS5A and
REC8 were detected at the inner centromere domain, but in side-viewed centromeres the
PDS5A signals were larger than those of REC8 (Fig. 1Q, inset). In metaphase II PDS5A was
also present at the centromeres. In side-viewed centromeres two PDS5A signals were
detected below kinetochores (Fig. 1S; bottom inset), while in top-viewed centromeres a
single PDS5A ring encircled kinetochores (Fig. 1S; top inset).
Unlike PDS5A, PDS5B colocalized with SYCP3 along the AEs/LEs of the autosomes
and sex chromosomes from leptotene up to pachytene (Fig. 2A-F). In addition, rounded
PDS5B signals protruded from the AEs/LEs ends in pachytene (Fig. 2E and F). REC8
colocalized with PDS5B along AEs/LEs, but was not present at the two close PDS5B signals
at SC ends (Fig. 2G and H). Instead, PDS5B signals at AEs/LEs ends colocalized with TRF1,
a telomere binding protein (Fig. 2I and J). We found that PDS5B was also enriched at the
ends of aligned but non-synapsed AEs/LEs present in pachytene-like spermatocytes from
mutants for the SC central element protein SYCE3 (Syce3-/-), and the transverse filament
protein SYCP1 (Sycp1-/-) (Fig. S2). Thus, the presence of PDS5B at telomeres does not
require synapsis. We also analyzed the distribution of PDS5B in spermatocytes from mice
deficient for the meiosis-specific cohesin subunits SMC1β (Adelfalk et al., 2009) and REC8

(Biswas et al., 2016), which present variable degrees of telomere abnormalities. In Smc1β-/pachytene-like spermatocytes, PDS5B localized along the shorthened SCs and unsynapsed
AEs/LEs (Fig. S3A-C), and altered signals were present at SC ends (Fig. S3B and C),
resembling those reported for telomeric DNA or telomere proteins in Smc1β-/- mouse
spermatocytes (Adelfalk et al., 2009). In Rec8-/- spermatocytes PDS5B was also observed at
shortened unsynapsed AEs (Fig. S3D-F). In this case, a low number of AEs ends presented
a highly reduced PDS5B labelling (Fig. S3E and F), consistent with the reported existence of
3 to 4 chromosomes per spermatocyte presenting decreased levels of telomeric DNA and
telomere proteins (Biswas et al., 2016). Altogether our results indicate that in mouse
spermatocytes PDS5B specifically accumulates at telomeres during prophase I.
Consistent with the telocentric nature of mouse chromosomes, kinetochore signals
were always internally located in relation to PDS5B signals at the centromeric end of the
pachytene LEs (Fig. 2K and L). By diplotene, PDS5B persisted along the desynapsing LEs,
and at telomeres (Fig. 2M and N). In some images we could detect two closely associated
PDS5B signals at desynapsed LEs (Fig. 2M and N, insets), corresponding to telomeres of
sister chromatids. During diakinesis, PDS5B labeling began to disappear from the autosome
LEs but not from telomeres (Fig. 2O and P). In metaphase I, large PDS5B signals
colocalized with SYCP3 at the inner centromere domains (Fig. 3A-F). Interestingly, smaller
PDS5B signals were located in pairs at the distal chromosome ends (Fig. 3C-F), that are
reminiscent of the location of distal telomeres in metaphase I bivalents (Viera et al., 2003). In
metaphase II chromosomes, large PDS5B signals were found at each centromere between
the kinetochores (Fig. 3G-J). Altogether, our results indicate that PDS5A and PDS5B are
present along the AEs/LEs in prophase I, similar to cohesin subunits, although the two
paralogs display somehow different dynamics. Moreover, only PDS5B appears at telomeres.

A single PDS5 paralog protein is sufficient for prophase I progression
The different localization patterns of PDS5A and PDS5B during prophase I stages suggest
that they may have specific functions in meiosis. To address this possibility, we took
advantage of Pds5 deficient mice generated previously (Carretero et al., 2013). Since
constitutive knock out alleles for each gene are lethal in homozygosis, we used male mice
carrying conditional knock out (cKO) alleles for Pds5A, Pds5B or both (Pds5AB hereafter) in
combination with a Cre recombinase allele that can be induced by tamoxifen supplemented
in the diet (Fig. S1A). Taking into account the approximate duration of meiosis in male
mouse (Griswold, 2016), we initially designed an experimental procedure that could allow us
to study the phenotype of Pds5 deficient mice at all meiotic stages. We supplemented food
pellets with 4-OHT to eight-week old wild-type, Pds5A cKO, Pds5B cKO and Pds5AB cKO
mice for 6 weeks. Despite wild-type, Pds5A cKO and Pds5B cKO animals were healthy

during the 6 weeks treatment, the health condition of double Pds5AB cKO individuals was
negatively affected from day 15 onwards. Consequently in order to assure the animal’s
welfare, and to standardize the experimental conditions, we decided to set the duration of 4OHT treatments to 15 days, independently of the genotype. Efficient excision of the
corresponding targeted exon was confirmed by PCR while immunoblot analyses of testis
extracts showed only a partial decrease of protein levels (Fig. S1B and C). However,
immunofluorescence analysis showed the absence of PDS5A and PDS5B proteins in
tamoxifen-treated Pds5A cKO and Pds5B cKO spermatocytes, respectively, before midpachytene stage, while in later stages stainings were indistinguisable between wild-type and
Pds5 deficient cells (Fig. S1D-W). We reckon that the PDS5 proteins present in these midlate pachytene spermatocytes were generated prior to the excision of the corresponding
gene after initiation of the tamoxifen treatment. These results are congruent with the
predicted duration of the different prophase I stages in mouse spermatogenesis (Griswold,
2016). Furthermore, the analysis of seminiferous tubules from both Pds5A cKO and Pds5B
cKO individuals treated for 15-days with tamoxifen demonstrated that spermatocytes
completed all meiotic and spermiogenic stages without any appreciable failure (Fig. S4).
Since PDS5B has been specifically involved in centromere cohesion in MEFs
(Carretero et al., 2013), we next studied centromere distribution in Pds5A or Pds5B deficient
spermatocytes. Our results did not evidence any appreciable alteration of centromere
cohesion, or in their arrangement, in those spermatocytes (Fig. S5). Consequently, it can be
assumed that neither PDS5A nor PDS5B are essential for prophase I progression until mid
pachytene in male mice. However, simultaneous ablation of the two genes does have an
important impact, as described in the next sections.

PDS5 proteins regulate AE/LE length but are not required for synapsis
We next analyzed spermatocytes from Pds5AB cKO animals after tamoxifen treatment. Both
PDS5A and PDS5B were completely absent from leptotene, zygotene and some pachytene
spermatocytes (Fig. 4A-C and F-H). Interestingly, these early prophase I spermatocytes
presented short SYCP3-labeled AEs/LEs and SCs (Figs. 4A-C and F-H, and S6A-C), a
phenotype characteristic of all meiotic cohesin subunit mutants (Biswas et al., 2016; Ward et
al., 2016). In some other pachytene spermatocytes wild-type levels of PDS5A and PDS5B
were present and showed normal length SCs (Figs. 4D and I, and S6D). Metaphase I
bivalents also showed wild-type levels and distributions of PDS5A and PDS5B (Fig. 4E and
J), and meiotic divisions and spermiogenesis looked normal (Fig. S6E-L and N-O). Staining
with an antibody against the testis-specific histone H1t, a marker of mid-pachytene chromatin
(Drabent et al., 1996), further showed that 95% of pachytene spermatocytes from Pds5AB
cKO treated animals with short SCs (n=200) were H1t-negative (Fig. 4K), while the remaining

5% of cells were faintly positive for H1t labeling (Fig. 4L), and all pachytene spermatocytes
with normal SC length were strongly positive for H1t (Fig. 4M). Thus, spermatocytes with
short AEs/LEs are probably those generated during tamoxifen treatment, which had
progressed until early pachytene, while spermatocytes from mid pachytene onwards
correspond to those that entered meiosis prior to the treatment. Average SC length
measured in early pachytene spermatocytes (negative for H1t staining) was significantly
reduced in Pds5AB deficient cells compared to wild-type (80±7 µm versus 154±20 µm, Fig.
4N), representing a reduction of around 52% of SC length. We also scored the number of
spermatocytes in the different phases of prophase I (n=1,000) and observed a >2-fold
increase in zygotene and a decrease in pachytene in Pds5AB deficient testes compared to
wild-type (Fig. S6M and Q). Among the Pds5AB cKO pachytene spermatocytes only 11.6%
of them displayed shortened SCs. Altogether, these results reflect a delay in synapsis and/or
meiotic recombination progression.
To assess synapsis, we used double immunolabeling of SYCP3 and SYCP1.
Leptotene wild-type spermatocytes displayed long discontinuous threads of SYCP3
representing the assembly of AEs along each chromosome (Fig. 5A). By contrast, 40 short
individual SYCP3-labeled AEs were found in Pds5AB deficient leptotene spermatocytes (Fig.
5E). The pair-wise association of some AEs signals the initiation of synapsis by early
zygotene (Fig. 5B and F). In these spermatocytes, the SYCP1 labeling was only located
along the synapsed regions of the AEs/LEs (Fig. 5B and F), which became longer as
synapsis progressed (Fig. 5C and G). Both the SYCP3-labeled AEs/LEs and the SYCP1labeled CE were considerably shorter in the absence of both PDS5 proteins (Fig. 5C and G),
but by early pachytene 19 fully synapsed autosomal SCs and the partially unsynapsed sex
bivalent were found both in wild-type and Pds5AB deficient cells (Fig. 5D and H). Double
labeling of SYCP3 and HORMAD2, a protein present at unsynapsed AEs/LEs (Wojtasz et al.,
2009), further confirmed the accurate synapsis in Pds5AB deficient spermatocytes (Fig. 5IL). We therefore conclude that PDS5 proteins are not required for synapsis of homologous
chromosomes in male mouse meiosis.
Normal cohesin distribution along meiotic chromosome axes in the absence of PDS5
proteins
We next analyzed whether the shortening of AEs/LEs in Pds5AB deficient spermatocytes
was the consequence of an abnormal distribution or absence of cohesin complexes.
Contrary to this possibility, the cohesin subunits SMC1α, SMC1β, SMC3, RAD21, RAD21L,
REC8, and STAG3, were detected along the shorthened AEs/LEs in zygotene and early
pachytene spermatocytes (Figs. 6A-I, and S7A-L). Cohesin cofactors Sororin and WAPL
were also found along the synapsed regions (Fig. 6J-L) and AEs/LEs (Fig. 6M-O),

respectively, as previously reported in wild-type spermatocytes (Brieño-Enríquez et al., 2016;
Gómez et al., 2016; Jordan et al., 2017). Centromeric cohesion defects were not evident in
deficient Pds5AB zygotene and early pachytene spermatocytes, as kinetochore signals
appeared unaltered at the ends of AEs/LEs or SCs, respectively, as in Pds5AB proficient mid
pachytene spermatocytes (Fig. S7M-O). Thus, the absence of PDS5 proteins does not
compromise the loading and maintenance of cohesin complexes or centromere cohesion in
prophase I.
PDS5 proteins affect meiotic recombination
Since Pds5AB deficient spermatocytes accumulate at zygotene but no clear defects in
synapsis could be detected, we next asked about progression of meiotic recombination. The
DSB marker γ-H2AX was found throughout the chromatin at leptotene, in chromatin
surrounding unsynapsed regions in zygotene, and restricted to the sex body in early
pachytene spermatocytes with shortened SCs, as well as in mid/late pachytene
spermatocytes displaying a regular SC length (Fig. 7A-D). This dynamic distribution of γH2AX in Pds5AB deficient spermatocytes is consistent with that reported for wild-type
spermatocytes (Mahadevaiah et al., 2001), suggesting that DSBs were generated and
repaired in the absence of PDS5 proteins.
Next, we analyzed the distribution of RAD51, a protein that participates in homology
search at the so-called early recombination nodules along leptotene and zygotene AEs/LEs
(Moens et al., 2007). RAD51 signals were indeed seen along AEs in leptotene
spermatocytes with or without PDS5 proteins and their number gradually decreased as
prophase I progressed (Figs. 7E-H, and S8). The average number of RAD51 foci was
226±36 in wild-type but only 151±22 in Pds5AB deficient zygotene spermatocytes (Fig. 7I).
MLH1 foci, which mark late recombination nodules from mid-pachytene onwards (Moens et
al., 2007), could not be detected in most Pds5AB deficient early pachytene spermatocytes
with short SCs (96 out of 100; Fig. 7J). In the remaining 4 spermatocytes a single focus was
invariably found in autosomal bivalents and in the sex bivalent (Fig. 7K), and therefore the
mean number of MLH1 foci was 20. In mid/late pachytene spermatocytes displaying normal
length SCs, the average number of MLH1 foci was 22±1 (n=91). Altogether, our results
indicate that PDS5 proteins are not essential for initiation of meiotic recombination, but their
absence reduces the number of early recombination nodules.

Severe telomere abnormalities in the absence of PDS5 proteins
Since PDS5A and PDS5B participate in telomere cohesion in somatic cells (Carretero et al.,
2013), and PDS5B is present at telomeres of meiotic chromosomes (Fig. 2), we analyzed the
morphology and behavior of telomeres in Pds5AB deficient spermatocytes. Labeling with

antibodies against the telomere proteins TRF1 (Fig. 8A-D) and RAP1 (Fig. 8E-H) evidenced
the existence of multiple morphological alterations in early prophase I stages that were not
found in wild-type, Pds5A deficient or Pds5B deficient spermatocytes. These alterations
included stretched signals, multiple signals, a signal separated from the AEs/LEs, and ends
without signals (i to iv in Fig. 8I and K). Moreover, they were similar for TRF1 and RAP1
staining, and could be detected in leptotene, zygotene and early pachytene spermatocytes
(Fig. 8A-C and E-G, quantification in Fig. 8J and L, Table S1), but not in mid/late pachytene
spermatocytes in which PDS5 levels are presumably normal (Fig. 8D and H). As a rule, more
than 30% of telomeres presented an altered arrangement in zygotene and early pachytene
Pds5AB spermatocytes (Fig. 8J and L, Table S1). We also studied the distribution of SUN1,
an inner nuclear membrane protein that participates in the attachment of telomeres to the NE
during prophase I, a crucial event for homologs pairing, recombination and synapsis in
mammals (Ding et al., 2007). SUN1 signals appeared at some, but not all, AEs/LEs ends
during leptotene, zygotene and early pachytene (Fig. 8M-O), and displayed altered
morphologies reminiscent of the aberrations observed with TRF1 and RAP1 stainings (Fig.
8Q and R; quantification in Fig. 8S and Table S1). Anomalous or absent SUN1 signals were
observed at 36.51% and 19.27% of telomeres in Pds5AB zygotene and early pachytene
spermatocytes, respectively (Fig. 8M-S; Table S1). By mid/late pachytene, spermatocytes
presented normal SUN1 signals at both ends of the LEs (Fig. 8P).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a telomere-specific probe further
confirmed the abnormal telomere organization in leptotene, zygotene and early pachytene
spermatocytes lacking the two PDS5 proteins (Fig. 9A-D, quantification in 9E). By contrast,
from mid/late pachytene onwards the telomere DNA showed a regular distribution at LEs
ends (Fig. 9U-X), as in prophase I stages from PdsA deficient and Pds5B deficient
spermatocytes (Fig. S9). A combined analysis of telomeric DNA by FISH and
immunolabeling of RAP1 and SYCP3 in Pds5AB deficient spermatocytes in leptotene (Fig.
9F-J), zygotene (Fig. 9K-O) and early pachytene (Fig. 9P-T) demonstrated that a given
telomere abnormality could be sometimes equally distinguished by FISH or immunolabeling
(Fig. 9I and N), while in some other cases abnormal telomere FISH signals and no RAP1
signals were observed (Fig. 9J, O, S, and T). From these data we conclude that the absence
of both PDS5 proteins promote the appearance of severe abnormalities at telomeres
including aberrant telomeric DNA organization and distribution of telomere proteins.

PDS5 proteins promote proper attachment of telomeres to the NE
Given the alterations found at telomeres in Pds5AB deficient spermatocytes, we
subsequently asked whether telomere attachment to the NE might be affected. To explore
this possibility, we initially performed a double immunolabeling of SYCP3 and TRF1 on

squashed spermatocytes, a technique that preserves the nuclear volume and chromosome
positioning inside nuclei (Page et al., 1998; Parra et al., 2002), and collected image stacks
across the entire volume of prophase I nuclei (Fig. 10). TRF1 signals were found at the ends
of the SYCP3-labeled LEs in zygotene and early pachytene spermatocytes, from both wildtype and Pds5AB deficient mice (Fig. 10A-P). Nonetheless, while TRF1 signals were
invariably positioned at the nuclear periphery in wild-type spermatocytes (Fig. 10A-D and IL), some TRF1 signals were instead found at the nuclear interior in the absence of PDS5
proteins, indicating a lack of attachment of some telomeres to the NE (Fig. 10E-H and M-P;
Movie S1). Morphological alterations in telomere structure similar to those observed in
spread spermatocytes could be also detected (Fig. 10Q-T; Movie S2-S5). Interestingly,
telomere-less ends of LEs were always found at the nuclear interior and thus non-attached to
the NE (Movie S5). Similar results were obtained when analysing SUN1 distribution in
squashed spermatocytes (Fig. S10; Movies S6-S8). As previously described for TRF1, SUN1
telomere-less ends of LEs were always located at the nuclear interior (Movie S8).
Consequently, our data indicate that the simultaneous absence of PDS5A and PDS5B
causes severe abnormalities in telomere morphology in prophase I spermatocytes and alters
their attachment to the NE.

Discussion
In the present study we have examined the distribution of the cohesin cofactors PDS5A and
PDS5B in mouse spermatocytes and analyzed the consequences of their depletion in order
to understand their contributions to mammalian meiosis. As Pds5A and Pds5B genes are
essential for embryonic development, we employed mice carrying conditional knock out
alleles for one or both genes in homozygosis and a Cre transgene induced by tamoxifen
(Carretero et al., 2013). Due to the deleterious effects of eliminating the PDS5 proteins in the
whole organism, tamoxifen treatment was limited to two weeks. In this time, depletion of
PDS5 proteins was observed in spermatocytes up to mid-pachytene stage. Taking this
limitation into account, we have observed that single elimination of either PDS5 protein does
not alter progression through prophase I, while elimination of both results in severe
phenotypes on AE organization and telomere integrity.
PDS5A and PDS5B are located at AEs/LEs but their dynamics are different
Immunofluorescence staining with specific antibodies shows that PDS5A and PDS5B are
distributed along the AEs/LEs in prophase I mouse spermatocytes, as previously described
for the cohesin subunits SMC1α, SMC1β, SMC3, RAD21, RAD21L, REC8 and STAG3
(Ishiguro, 2019). It is likely that the presence of PDS5A and PDS5B at meiotic chromosome
axes occurs in the context of the cohesin complex, as reported for PDS5 in different
organisms (van Heemst et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2006; Jin et al., 2009),
and consistent with the finding that PDS5B co-immunoprecipitates with meiosis-specific
cohesin subunits REC8 and SMC1β from mouse spermatocyte extracts (Fukuda and Höög,
2010). Likewise, similar distribution patterns have been previously reported in mouse meiosis
for the cohesin cofactors WAPL (Zhang et al., 2008; Brieño-Enríquez et al., 2016), and
NIPBL and MAU2 (Visnes et al., 2014). The exception is Sororin, which localizes at the
central region of the SC (Gómez at al., 2016; Jordan et al., 2017).
We have found intriguing differences between the dynamics of PDS5A and PDS5B
during prophase I. While PDS5A appears at AEs/LEs by zygotene and is displaced from
them by mid pachytene, PDS5B is visualized at AEs/LEs during all prophase I stages.
Moreover, PDS5B is present at telomeres during prophase I. However, since elimination of
either PDS5 protein does not result in defects in meiosis progression, at least up to midpachytene, the functional significance of the different association/dissociation dynamics of
the two PDS5 proteins is unclear. In particular, the lack of telomere defects in Pds5B
deficient cells suggests that PDS5A can also perform the function of PDS5B required for
telomere integrity even if we do not find PDS5A at telomeres either in wild-type or in Pds5B

deficient spermatocytes. We cannot discard the possibility that the PDS5A antibody used in
our study is unable to detect PDS5A at telomeres.
PDS5 proteins are required for axial element organization
Spermatocytes lacking both PDS5 proteins are able to fulfill complete synapsis, but display
severely shortened AEs/LEs in prophase I. A similar shortening of chromosome axes in the
absence of PDS5 has been described in other organisms (van Heemst et al., 1999; Wang et
al., 2003; Jin et al., 2009; Ding et al., 2016). The extent of SC shortening in Pds5AB deficient
mouse spermatocytes is comparable, or even greater, to that found in spermatocytes from
cohesin knock out mouse models (Biswas et al., 2016; Ward et al., 2016). Consistent with
the dependency of AE/LE assembly on previous loading of cohesin complexes along meiotic
chromosomes (Eijpe et al., 2000), cohesin axes also appear shortened. Although it is not
possible to make a quantitative assessment in our preparations, we confirm that all the
cohesin subunits that we tested (SMC1α, SMC1β, SMC3, REC8, RAD21, RAD21L, and
STAG3), as well as the cohesin cofactors Sororin and WAPL, were present at the shortened
cohesin axes of Pds5AB deficient prophase I cells.
Why do cohesin-deficient chromosomes assemble shortened SCs? Descriptions of
meiotic chromosome morphology suggest that chromatin loops emanate from a
proteinaceous axial core containing cohesin and LE proteins (Zickler and Kleckner, 1999),
but the actual mechanism of chromosome assembly remains unknown. In a recent preprint
reporting HiC analyses in yeast meiotic chromosomes, Schalbetter et al. (2019 biorxiv) show
that the patterns observed are reminiscent of those obtained in interphase mammalian cells
after depletion of WAPL or PDS5, suggesting that reduced dissociation dynamics of cohesin
may be an important feature of meiotic cohesin complexes (Wutz et al., 2017). The study
further proposes that REC8-dependent loop extrusion is reponsible for these patterns and
drives chromosome arm compaction while SC formation and synapsis promote additional
compaction. Since SC length is restored in Smc1β-/-Sycp3-/- double mutant spermatocytes,
cohesin might in fact counteract chromosome axis compaction promoted by the SC (Novak
et al., 2008). Whether cohesin complexes mediating cohesion and those driving loop
extrusion are the same or the coordination between them remains an open question (Muller
et al., 2018; Holzmann 2019). In any case, PDS5 regulates both activities of cohesin, and it
is therefore not surprising that its deletion results in defects similar to those reported for
meiotic cohesin mutants. We envision that in both scenarios, reduced cohesin or reduced
cohesin dynamics in the absence of PDS5, a lower number of longer chromatin loops would
be formed and result in shorter AEs/LEs.

A role for PDS5 proteins in meiotic recombination?
The initiation of meiotic recombination precedes, and mediates, homologous chromosomes
synapsis in prophase I. PDS5A and PDS5B are not required for the formation of SPO11mediated DSBs or their repair. Nonetheless, a reduced number of RAD51 foci was found
along the shortened AEs/LEs of Pds5AB deficient spermatocytes, as well as of MLH1 foci,
which might point to a decrease of recombination rates, since MLH1 is associated to late
recombination nodules (Moens et al., 2007). The reduction in RAD51 foci might be a direct
consequence of shorter AEs/LEs (Kleckner et al., 2003). Delayed or defective DSB repair,
along with SC shortening, has been reported in meiocytes lacking the cohesin subunits
REC8 (Bannister et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2005), SMC1β (Revenkova et al., 2004), STAG3
(Fukuda et al., 2014; Hopkins et al., 2014; Llano et al., 2014; Winters et al., 2014) and
RAD21L (Herrán et al., 2011). An additional possibility is that RAD51 recruitment or function
is impaired in the absence of PDS5 proteins, as in vitro assays show that PDS5B interacts
physically with RAD51 and stimulates RAD51-mediated DNA strand invasion (Couturier et
al., 2016).

PDS5 proteins secure telomere integrity
In somatic cells, telomere cohesion guarantees proper replication of the telomeres. The
absence of PDS5 proteins, or Sororin, or cohesin-SA1, or treatment with low doses of the
DNA replication inhibitor aphidicolin, result in altered telomere organization or telomere
fragility (Sfeir et al., 2009; Remeseiro et al., 2012; Carretero et al., 2013). Cohesion is
established during the premeiotic S-phase, and it is possible that PDS5 deficiency at this
time could explain the telomere defects observed in subsequent meiotic prophase I.
However, it is important to note that telomere aberrations identical to those reported here
have been observed in Smc1β-/- spermatocytes, while this meiosis-specific cohesin subunit is
not expressed in premeiotic cells (Adelfalk et al., 2009). Moreover, an elegant study
expressing SMC1α under the control of the Smc1β promoter in Smc1β-/- mice showed
restoration of several meiotic phenotypes including SC length while telomere aberrations
remained uncorrected (Biswas et al., 2018). It has therefore been suggested that SMC1β
may facilitate the arrangement of telomere DNA into the so-called T-loop and/or the
association of telomere factors to ensure proper telomere behavior. In this scenario, PDS5
proteins might control SMC1β function(s) at telomeres, despite our observation that they are
not necessary for the loading and maintenance of SMC1β or any other cohesin subunit along
chromosomes axes during prophase I. At least PDS5B has been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with SMC1β in mouse spermatocytes (Fukuda and Höög, 2010). Further
studies will be necessary to elucidate if telomere aberrations found in Pds5AB deficient
spermatocytes are due to cohesin miss-regulation during premeiotic DNA replication, a

that PDS5 proteins are crucial for the proper arrangement and functionality of telomeres in
male mouse meiosis.

Animals and ethics statement
Mice carrying conditional knock out alleles for Pds5A (Pds5Aloxfrt or Pds5A cKO), Pds5B
(Pds5Blox or Pds5B cKO) or both (Pds5Aloxfrt; Pds5Blox or Pds5AB cKO) in homozygosis and
a Cre-ERT2 transgene, generated previously (Carretero et al., 2013), were used for this
study. Animals were kept at the Animal Facility of the Spanish National Cancer Research

with

the

recommendation of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations
(FELASA). To induce recombination, 8 week-old male mice were fed with tamoxifencontaining diet for 2 weeks before being sacrificed and their testes surgically removed. All
animal procedures were approved by local and regional ethics committees (Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and Ethics Committee for Research and Animal Welfare,
Instituto de Salud Carlos III) and performed according to the European Union guidelines.
Genotyping was performed by PCR with the following primers, as indicated in Figure S1A:

Protein levels were also analyzed by immunoblot of total protein extracts prepared by lysing
a piece of testis tissue in RIPA buffer. Other knock out mice used in this study were: Syce3-/(a gift from R. Benavente; Schramm et al., 2011), Sycp1-/- (a gift from C. Höög; de Vries et
al., 2005), Rec8-/- (a gift from J.C. Schimenti; Bannister et al., 2004), and Smc1β-/- (a gift from
R. Jessberger; Revenkova et al., 2004).

Squashing and spreading of spermatocytes
For immunofluorescence analyses, testes were detunicated and seminiferous tubules
processed according to previously described protocols for obtaining squashing (Page et al.,
1998; Parra et al., 2002) or spreading (Peters et al., 1997) preparations of spermatocytes.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
After spermatocytes processing, the resulting preparations were rinsed three times for 5 min
in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4ºC with the corresponding combinations of primary
antibodies diluted in PBS. A rabbit polyclonal antibody for mouse PDS5A (C-107) was
generated by immunizig rabbits with a recombinant fragment (aa. 1188-1332) expressed in
Escherichia coli. Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies were prepared against mouse PDS5B: for
C-100 a synthetic peptide (aa. 2-24, HSKTRTNDGKITYPPGVKEISD) was used as
immunogen; for C-102 a recombinant fragment (aa. 1178-1300) expressed in E. coli was

used. Both antibodies against PDS5B yielded identical results in immunofluorescence
stainings of testes. An antibody against human PDS5B prepared by immunizing rabbits with
a synthetic peptide (CEEKLGMDDLTKLVQEQKPKGSQRS, aa. 1226-1249) was affinity
purified and used for western blot. All primary antibodies and dilutions used are presented in
Table S2. Following three washes in PBS, the slides were incubated for 45 min at room
temperature with secondary antibodies at a 1:100 dilution in PBS. The appropriated
combinations of the following secondary antibodies were employed for simultaneous doubleor triple-immunolabeling: Alexa 350, Alexa 488 and Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
IgG (Molecular Probes); Alexa 350, Alexa 594 and Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse
IgG (Molecular Probes); Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes);
Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (Molecular Probes); Alexa 488-conjugated
donkey anti-human IgG (Molecular Probes). Subsequently, slides were rinsed in PBS, and in
double-immunolabeling experiments counterstained for 3 min with 5 g/ml DAPI (4', 6diamidino-2-phenylindole). After a final rinse in PBS, the slides were mounted in Vectashield
(Vector Laboratories) and sealed with nail varnish.
Immunofluorescence-FISH
A combination of SYCP3 immunostaining, our double immunolabeling of SYCP3 and RAP1,
and telomere FISH were carried out in spread spermatocytes as previously reported (Viera et
al., 2003). For this purpose, a FITC-labeled (C3TA2)3 peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe
(Applied Biosystems) that specifically recognizes telomeric DNA was employed.

Histology
For histological sections, testes were divided in several pieces, which were fixed by
immersion in Bouin’s solution for 24 hours. After standard washes and dehydration,
Paraplast-embedded tissue blocks were cut in 3 μm thick sections in a Reichert microtome.
Finally, sections were stained with conventional Mallory's trichrome stain.
Image acquisition
Observations were performed using an Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with a
motorized Z axis and epifluorescence optics. Images were captured with an Olympus DP71
digital camera controlled by the CellP software (Olympus). For squashed spermatocytes,
image stacks comprising 65 focal planes across the entire spermatocyte nuclei were
captured. The complete image stacks were used to analyze the relative distribution of the
proteins at a given entire nucleus and for generating animated 3D reconstructions of nuclei

subsequently processed for obtaining complete Z-projections (65 focal planes) or partial Zprojections (15 focal planes along a certain nuclear region) using the ImageJ software. Final
images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software.
Quantification and statistical analyses
To measure SC length, each autosomal SC was scored in 33 early pachytene cells at
random, in preparations from three different individuals of each genotype, using the
“measurement” function of the ImageJ software. The SC length of the sex chromosomes was
disregarded since these chromosomes do not achieve complete synapsis and might
introduce errors. Since no statistical differences were found between individuals within a
given genotype by a Kruskal-Wallis test, the data were grouped and analyzed by a T-test
function (confidence level: 95%) using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software.
In order to determine the percentage of spermatocytes in a given prophase I substage, we analyzed and classified 1,000 spermatocytes at random in three individuals for
each genotype. For this purpose, spermatocytes were double immunolabeled for SYCP3 and
SYCP1 to determine the progression of synapsis, and thus the meiotic staging, of each
prophase I spermatocyte.
The quantification of RAD51 foci was performed in 15 zygotene nuclei, randomly
selected, in preparations from three different individuals of each genotype using the “multipoint” function of the ImageJ software. It is worth noting that only RAD51 foci located over
the LEs were scored. Since no statistical differences were found between individuals within a
given genotype by a Kruskal-Wallis test, the data were grouped and analyzed by a T-test
function (confidence level: 95%) using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. A similar approach was
employed to quantify MLH1 foci in 100 early pachytene spermatocytes displaying shortened
SCs and in 91 mid/late pachytene spermatocytes with regular SCs.
Telomere morphology was evaluated after the immunolabelling of the telomere
associated proteins TRF1, RAP1 and SUN1 and telomeric DNA FISH. Anomalous telomere
signals were classified as (i) telomere stretches: stretched signals emerging from the AE/LE
ends; (ii) multiple telomere: multiple signals at a given AE/LE end; (iii) distant telomeres: a
single signal separated from an AEs/LEs end; and (iv) telomere-less: AEs/LEs ends without
a detectable signal. For TRF1 we scored 1646 telomeres in zygotene spermatocytes and
738 in pachytene ones. For RAP1 we evaluated 1376 and 328 telomeres in zygotene and
early pachytene spermatocytes, respectively. A total amount of 715 zygotene and 410 early
pachytene telomeres were analysed to evaluate SUN1 morphology. Telomere FISH signals
were examined in 1198 zygotene telomeres and in 574 pachytene ones.

Figure S1. PDS5A and PDS5B elimination in spermatocytes.
(A) Schematic representation of the conditional alleles (loxfrt or lox) and the null allele (-)
obtained upon Cre-mediated recombination for Pds5A (top) and Pds5B (bottom). The
position of the primers used for genotyping is indicated (blue arrows). (B) Example of
genotyping PCRs for Pds5A (top) and Pds5B (bottom) alleles using DNA obtained from testis
of the indicated mice as well as DNA from mouse embryo fibroblasts as control. cKO mice
carry the conditional allele(s) in homozygosis and a Cre-ERT2 transgene and have been
treated with tamoxifen to promote the translocations of the Cre recombinase to the nucleus.
In most cKO mice, excision of the targeted exon is not complete and a weak band
corresponding to the conditional allele can be still be detected in addition to the stronger
band of the null allele. The sizes of the different PCR products are: Pds5A wild-type (+) 872
bp, loxfrt 778 bp and null (-) 414 bp; for Pds5B wild-type (+) 706 bp, lox 859 bp and null (-)
415 bp. (C) Immunoblot analysis of total extracts prepared from testes of mice of the
indicated genotypes. Decreasing amounts of extract from testes obtained from wild-type
mice (WT) were loaded for comparison. Overall, elimination of Pds5B is less efficient than
elimination of Pds5A both in the single and in the double cKO mice. (D-M) Double
