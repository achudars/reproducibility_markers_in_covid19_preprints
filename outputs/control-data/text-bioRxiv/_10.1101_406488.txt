Abstract
Signal transduction mechanisms and successive
regulatory processes alter the lateral mobility of β2adrenergic receptors (β2AR). In this work we
combined modern single particle tracking methods in
order to analyze the diffusion dynamics of SNAPtagged β2AR in HEK wild-type cells and HEK βarrestin knockout cells before and after agonist
stimulation. For analysis of trajectories we first used
mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis.
Secondly, we applied an advanced variational
Bayesian treatment of hidden Markov models
(vbSPT) in combination with the recently introduced
packing coefficient (Pc), which together provided a
detailed model of three discrete diffusive states, state
transitioning and spatial confinement. Interesting to
note, state switching between S3 (fast-diffusing) and
S1 (slow-diffusing) occurred sequentially over an
intermediate state S2. After ligand stimulation more
SNAP-tagged β2AR in HEK wild-type cells switched

occupancy into the slow-diffusing state, whereas less
receptors were found in the fast diffusive state.
Unexpectedly, all three states showed a fraction of
confined receptor mobility that increased under
stimulation, but confinement sizes were unaffected.
Receptor diffusion characteristics were comparable in
HEK β-arrestin knockout cells under basal conditions
and only minor but non-significant changes occurred
upon stimulation, as expected from the depletion of
β-arrestin, an important regulatory protein. The data
presented here on the occurrence of different
diffusion states, their transitioning and variable
spatial confinements clearly indicate that lateral
mobility of β2AR is much more complex than
previously thought.

Introduction
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent one
of the largest protein families in the mammalian
genome1. GPCRs are involved in numerous important
signaling processes initiated e.g. by neurotransmitters
or hormones. Major mechanisms and regulation of
GPCR signal transduction have been discovered2,3.
One of the most investigated GPCR is the β2adrenergic receptor (β2AR). Stimulation of β2AR
activates a heterotrimeric G protein, from which the
Gs alpha subunit is released to activate adenylate
cyclase (AC). AC catalyses the synthesis of the
second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP). Desensitization of β2AR, achieved by two
phosphorylation steps mediated by protein kinase A
(PKA) and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2
(GRK2), respectively, prevents over-stimulation of
the
cell.
Furthermore,
redistribution
of
phosphorylated β2AR from functional microdomains
into clathrin coated pits followed by receptor
internalization reduces receptor density on the cell
surface.
However, little is known about the lateral mobility of
β2AR during signal transduction and regulation
processes. Immobile, confined, and free diffusion
behaviour were found possibly characterizing
different functional states of adrenergic receptors4–6.
Sungkaworn et al. recently observed immobilization
of α2A-adrenergic receptors while interacting with Gs
alpha subunits4. Interactions of β-adrenergic
receptors with scaffold proteins7 or confinement in
caveolae domains8 are further discussed for varying
receptor
diffusion
properties.
Furthermore,
desensitized β2AR interacting with regulatory
proteins like β-arrestin, AP-2, and dynamin recruited
to clathrin coated pits leads to the formation of an

internalization complex9,10 with nearly immobile
lateral diffusion behavior.
In this work we applied modern single particle
tracking methods to analyze the lateral mobility of
SNAP-tagged β2AR in HEK wild-type cells and HEK
β-arrestin knockout cells. The latter cell line lacks
expression of regulatory adaptor proteins β-arrestin2
and β-arrestin39. Fluorescent labeling of β2AR was
realized by expression of SNAP-tag fusion protein11
in both cell lines combined with the highly specific
and photostable dye substrate BG-CF640R12,13 .
Distributions of single β2AR diffusion coefficients
derived from linear fitting of MSD curves of each
track were determined. Additionally, all tracks of
each condition were evaluated using a software based
on a variational Bayesian treatment of Hidden
Markov Models (vbSPT) to identify discrete
diffusive states and state transitioning probabilities.
We also implemented the recently introduced
packing coefficient14 to characterize confined
diffusion of receptors. For comparison, HEK βarrestin knockout cells transfected with ceruleantagged β-arrestin2 were examined. In addition, HEK
wild-type cells were analyzed in which β-arrestin2
recruitment was blocked by the GRK2 inhibitor
paroxetine.

Figure 1: Fluorescent staining of HEK SNAP-β2 cells with BGCF640R in a basal and stimulated state. Isoprenaline (10 μM)
was added after the initial image acquisition at t = 0 min. Top: In
the basal condition, plasma membranes were clearly stained in
both genetic backgrounds, indicating expression and
membranous location of β2AR. Bottom: Following stimulation in
HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells, the membrane staining was
displaced by endosomal receptor internalization, as seen in the
formation of concentrated fluorescent spots within the cells. This
effect was absent in the HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO cells, which did
not show differing receptor distribution following stimulation.

Results and Discussion

Both dye specificity to SNAP-β2AR and strongly
visible stimulation response of the cells prove the
suitability of this model system for single particle
tracking. Further, it allows the introduction of newer
and more precise evaluation methods, which will be
done in the following.

Validation of β2-adrenergic receptor labeling and
cell model functionality

Reduced mobility of β2-adrenergic receptors after
agonist stimulation

Wide-field fluorescent imaging of BG-CF640R
labeled HEK SNAP-β2 cells was performed in wildtype and β-arrestin-KO genetic backgrounds (Fig. 1).
Fluorescence intensity corresponding to stained
SNAP-β2 adrenergic receptors was high along the
plasma membrane of the cells. Fluorescent artefacts
by non-specific binding were low and cell
morphology normal, with no ostensible differences
between both genetic backgrounds.

For single particle microscopy, the cells were labeled
at a much lower dye concentration (10 nM) and
incubation time (5 min) to achieve optical separation
of single receptor molecules. The movement of single
particles in the optically focused apical membrane of
individual cells was clearly visible and was recorded
for 50 seconds per cell at 20 Hz using an EMCCD
camera. Diffusion behaviour of labeled receptors
under non-stimulating conditions was recorded for 30
minutes. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with
isoprenaline in order to detect alterations in lateral
mobility under stimulating conditions, again in a time
frame of 30 minutes. Particles were later
automatically localized and tracked (Fig. 2). The data
of 160 cell measurements were obtained from eight
independent experiments and were pooled in respect
to genetic background and stimulation condition.

Stimulation of stained HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells
with 10 µM isoprenaline, a β-adrenoceptor agonist,
led to the formation of concentrated fluorescent spots
within cells after 30 minutes, corresponding to early
endosomes carrying labeled β2AR. Following
stimulation in HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO cells,
fluorescence was still localized in the plasma
membrane after 30 minutes, with no visible
formation of early endosomes.

Figure 2: TOP: Example of particle localization and track
creation. Shown is a cropped region of 2.6 x 2.6 μm in the apical
cell membrane, recorded in 50 ms intervals, in which a
freestanding single particle is diffusing. The fluorescent signal of
this particle is detected and its origin precisely localized by
Gaussian fitting. The coordinates are subsequently linked to
resemble the path of lateral receptor movement. Bottom left:
β2AR in HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells showed a heterogeneous
diffusion coefficient distribution with a median D of 0.060 μm²/s.
Following stimulation, the proportion of small (D < 0.4 μm²/s)
diffusion coefficients strongly increased, reducing the median D
to 0.043 μm²/s. Bottom right: β2AR in HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO
cells showed a similar distribution pattern with slightly lower
basal (unstimulated) values, as indicated by a median D of 0.053
μm²/s. Stimulation resulted in only a slight shift towards lower
diffusion coefficients, with a median D of 0.049 μm²/s.

The movement of particles was first analyzed by
linear fitting of mean squared displacement curves to
receive short-term diffusion coefficients of single
particles (Fig. 2). In HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells
the labeled β2AR showed a heterogeneous diffusion
coefficient distribution with a median D of 0.060
µm2/s (N = 2700 tracks). Following stimulation,
diffusion coefficients strongly shifted towards low
values, reducing significantly the median D to 0.043
µm2/s (N = 2766). This effect likely corresponds to
desensitized receptors prior to internalization
(compare Fig. 1).
Evaluation of HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO cells showed
a comparable distribution of β2AR diffusion
coefficients with a lowered median D of 0.053 µm2/s
in the basal state (N = 4909). Under stimulating
conditions only a slight shift toward slower diffusion
coefficients was observed, with a median D of 0.049
µm2/s (N = 5147). Thus, the isoprenaline mediated
reduction in median D of β2AR depends on the
presence of β-arrestins, leading to receptor
internalization together with other factors. To study
the oligomerization states of β2AR detected on the
cell surface, histogram analysis of the fluorescence

intensities of all the particles were performed for
each condition (Fig. 1, supplemental material). Data
of HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells were fitted with a
mixed Gaussian model. Four different intensity
populations were observed corresponding to 31% of
receptor monomers, 42% of receptor dimers, 21% of
receptor trimers, and 6% of receptor tetramers. This
finding was also found for HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO
cells and did not change even after isoprenaline
stimulation for both genetic backgrounds (Fig 1,
supplemental material). Thus, reduction in median D
of β2AR under stimulating conditions cannot be
attributed to increased formation of dimers. Calebiro
et al. analysed β2AR oligomerization and lateral
mobility using single-molecule TIRF microscopy15.
They found for overexpressed SNAP-tagged β2AR in
CHO cells fractions of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetramers
with respective abundances of approx. 5%, 50%,
30%, and 15%. Remarkably, the distribution of the
oligomerization states in CHO cells is not exactly the
same as in our HEK cells. In particular, the presence
of monomers was more pronounced in our
experiments. Similar to our results Calebiro et al. did
not find an effect on the oligomerization state of
β2ARs after agonistic stimulation15.
The difference in particle numbers between both
genetic backgrounds can most likely be explained by
differing expression levels of β2AR, rather than βarrestin pathway blockage. Hence, direct comparison
of both backgrounds is more ambiguous than
analyzing the effects of stimulation, which is
prioritized in our experiments.
In a similar experiment that used SNAP-tag labeling
of β2AR in CHO cells, a comparable median D of
0.039 µm2/s was determined by Calebiro and coworkers15. Remarkably, isoprenaline stimulation
using the same concentration had no effect on
diffusivity, which was not further discussed by the
authors. Sungkaworn et al. also did not observe
significant changes to diffusion states in similar
conditions4. We think that in our experiment,
endogenous expression of β2AR in HEK16 or high
levels of receptor expression in stable clones may be
the deciding factors that lead to receptor
desensitization and altered diffusion. Our results
agree with a recent study by Yanagawa et al., in
which the average MSD-derived diffusion coefficient
of β2AR in HEK cells was reduced from 0.078 to
0.051 µm²/s by stimulation using 10 µM
isoprenaline17. This suggests that principally changes
in diffusion coefficient are comparable even for
different imaging modalities (TIRFM and wide-field)
and receptor expression strategies (transient
expression and stable clones).

A three-state classification model showed
consistent values for diffusion coefficients
obtained by vbSPT evaluation
The diffusion of β2AR was further analyzed by
applying an algorithm based on variational Bayesian
treatment of a hidden Markov model (vbSPT). In
contrast to previous hidden Markov model
approaches for single molecule analysis, vbSPT is
capable to extract useful information even from data
sets with short trajectories. vbSPT also allows the
detection of state transition probabilities, as well as
the number of diffusive states from experimental
data. Trajectories were segmented as described by
Persson et al. and segments were classified to one of
three distinct diffusion states (S1 to S3)18. Each of
these states is defined by diffusion coefficient,
occupancy value and state switching probabilities. To
maximize model accuracy, data were pooled by
condition as before, with 40 cells per analysis. The
resulting state diagrams (Fig. 3) showed a similar
model in all four conditions. Diffusion coefficients
for each state were nearly constant in all conditions
and ranged from 0.009 to 0.011 µm²/s (S1), 0.035 to
0.038 µm²/s (S2) and 0.116 to 0.123 µm²/s (S3). This
consistency demonstrated model robustness and
allowed comparison of other metrics associated with
the model, namely state occupancy and transition
probabilities. For bar graphs and significance testing
(Figure 3), slightly altered data was produced by
batch wise data splitting and analysis (4 x 10 cells per
condition).

Agonist stimulation altered
occupancies by state switching

receptor

state

In HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells that were
stimulated with isoprenaline, occupancy of slowdiffusing state S1 increased from 11.6 % to 16.0 %.
Similarly, the fraction of receptors in S2 increased
from 45.3 % to 48.4 %, whereas the fraction of
receptors in fast state S3 was strongly reduced from
43.1 % to 35.6 %. Only the changes for S1 and S3
occupancy were significant (Fig. 3).
The same trends were seen in HEK SNAP-β2 β-arrKO cells, but to a lesser extent: Stimulation increased
S1 occupancy from 10.6 % to 13.6 %. Occupancy of
S2 was initially higher at 49.8 %, and only increased
to 50.7 %. The occupancy of S3 was reduced from
39.6 % to 35.8 %.
Although stimulation initiated the same trends that
were seen in HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells, the
changes here were not significant. Obviously, the

subsequent regulation of activated β2AR in HEK
SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO cells was disturbed, as seen in the
missing internalization of β2AR under stimulating
conditions (Fig. 1).

By transfection of cerulean-tagged β-arrestin2 into
HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO cells, we were able to
demonstrate that the observed effects depend on the
absence of β-arrestin. HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO cells
expressing β-arrestin2 were identified by the
cerulean-tag in the fluorescence microscope. After
isoprenaline stimulation of these cells (n=10) in
single particle tracking experiments, the occupancy
of S1 increased significantly from 15.7 % to 23.6 %,
whereas S2 and S3 were slightly reduced from 54.9
% to 51.1 % and 29.4 % to 25.2 %, respectively (Fig.
4). Furthermore, the number of trajectories decreased

from 8577 to 5214, suggesting an internalization of
β2AR. Accordingly, transfected HEK SNAP-β2 β-arrKO cells expressing cerulean-tagged β-arrestin2
showed HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cell like behaviour.

paroxetine pre-treated and isoprenaline stimulated
HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells changed the
occupancy of S1 from 16.0 % to 15.8 %, S2 from
51.7 % to 54.0 % and S3 from 32.3 % to 30.2%,
which was not significant (Figure 4). Since the
trajectory number after isoprenaline stimulation
decreased only slightly from 5636 to 5263,
paroxetine also inhibited the internalization of β2AR
in these cells as described above. Thus, paroxetine
pre-treated HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells behaved
like HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO cells.
The observed differences in occupancy between
conditions correlate with altered probabilities of state
switching of the registered particles (shown by
arrows in Fig. 3 and 4). Two general observations
were made: Regardless of genetic background, pretreatment, and stimulation, state switching rates
between S1 and S3 were neglectable (P13 and P31 <=
0.001), thus proving sequentiality of state switching.
Secondly, P23 and P32 were consistently much higher
than P12 and P21, indicating that receptors were more
likely to change between the two fast states.

vbSPT analysis of pooled track data with HEK SNAP-β2 β-arrKO cells transfected with cerulean-tagged β-arrestin2 before (

stimulation. Coloured circles represent discrete diffusion states
S1 to S3 and circle size indicates occupancy. Arrows indicate

We propose that slowed diffusion by altered state
occupancies of activated β2AR (Fig. 3, 4) is caused
by the molecular interactions involving β-arrestin,
further supported by lack of a significant stimulation
response in HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO cells. The
importance of β-arrestin for the signalling of β2AR
was demonstrated by influences of paroxetine, a
GRK2 inhibitor, on β2-adrenergic signal transduction.
Guo et al. observed that paroxetine inhibits the
isoprenaline-induced phosphorylation of β2AR, the
recruitment of β-arrestin2, and the subsequent
receptor internalization19. In our experiments

Transition probability ratios between states were
calculated as the ratio of forward to backward
switching probabilities between adjacent states and
revealed significant changes for S2↔S3 transitioning
in HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells following
stimulation (Figure 3). A similar finding was
observed by Ibach et al. for SNAP-tagged epidermal
growth factor receptor in MCF-7 cells20. Since vbSPT
was developed based on processes in thermodynamic
equilibrium, we agree with the authors that transition
probability data have to be interpreted with care. The
reduced ratio indicated a stronger preference of
receptors for S2 compared to S3. This change was
also present, but not significant under β-arrestin-KO.
The ratio of S1↔S2 transitioning was lowered in
both genetic conditions under stimulation, but the
change was not significant. HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO
expressing cerulean-tagged β-arrestin2 showed a wild
type similar decrease in the ratio of S1↔S2
transitioning, but no difference in the ratio of S2↔S3
transitioning.

Diffusion states differed in spatial confinement
To further characterize the nature of each diffusion
state, the track segments corresponding to each state
were extracted from the full trajectories and subjected
to a confinement analysis based on their state and
packing coefficient (Pc). The Pc values were

calculated for sufficiently long segments using a 10
frame (0.5 s) sliding window, and compared against a
5 % false detection likelihood threshold (Pc95) based
on the simulation of random diffusion.
The results in HEK SNAP-β2 wild-type cells are
shown in Figure 5. In basal condition, about twothirds (68.2 %) of track segments of S1 showed a
confined diffusion with a mean confinement size
(square root of convex hull area) of 59 nm. Particles
in S2 were less often confined (42.7 %) and adhered
to a larger confinement size of 102 nm on average.
The fast state S3 showed an even smaller fraction of
confined trajectory segments (28.2 %) with an
increased confinement size of 182 nm.

Unlike the high stability of state diffusion
coefficients and also confinement areas, which were
hardly changed by isoprenaline stimulation, the
confined fraction was increased in each state.
Confined diffusion was expected based on the
recruitment of β2AR for the internalization process
under stimulating conditions (Fig. 5). This process
however does not correspond to the confined fraction
of one specific receptor state, since all confined
fractions are affected by stimulation. Knockout of βarrestin (Figure 5) lessened the increase of confined
fractions following stimulation and even slightly
reduced it in S1. Further experiments will hopefully
help to establish more detailed biological
correspondence for each state. For example, these
experiments may use shorter time periods following
stimulation, monitor the molecular interaction of
receptors, or analyze the diffusion of bound ligands.

Conclusion

Figure 5: Mean confinement size and confined fraction of HEK
SNAP-β2 wild-type cells before (
) and after stimulation (
) and HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO cells before (
) and after
stimulation (
) attained by Pc analysis. Marked value with p
≤ 0.05 is significantly different from its corresponding control,
determined by Student’s t-test.

The fact that all states included a degree of confined
diffusion and that mean confinement areas were
nearly constant for each state regardless of genetic
background and stimulatory condition are
noteworthy, as previous research often classified
states rigidly as either confined or free diffusion.

The HEK SNAP-β2 cell system with BG-CF640R
labeling was well suited to investigate localization,
lateral membrane diffusion and associated
confinement patterns of β2-adrenergic receptors. In
addition to a general characterization, stimulation
with 10 µM isoprenaline evoked strong changes that
could be tracked in a macro- and micromolecular
scale by using increasingly sensitive methods: In
short, classical fluorescence microscopy showed
internalization of membraneous β2AR following
stimulation. Histogram analysis of the fluorescence
intensities obtained from SPT of β2AR showed
receptor mono-, di, tri, and tetramers on the cell
surface. In MSD-based analysis of single particle
tracks, receptor internalization was reflected by
slowed diffusion in a heterogeneous diffusion
coefficient distribution. MSD is a classical approach
that is heavily averaging and therefore does not
reflect all information that is contained in particle
trajectories. Since the plasma membrane is a complex
and heterogeneous environment that continuously
influences the diffusion of β2AR, there is a need for a
more sophisticated analysis to resolve the complex
lateral mobility.
By variational Bayes analysis, we found three
underlying diffusion states for β2AR: A slow state, an
intermediate state and a fast state, with constant
confinement sizes (56 nm, 105 nm, 184 nm) in each
state even under stimulation. Surprisingly, all states
including the fast diffusive state had a confined
fraction of receptors. These fractions were changed

following stimulation, as well as state occupancies, a
change that was not seen in previous research.
The changes to occupancies result from altered state
switching that is exclusively sequential via
intermediate state S2. Inter-state transitioning
probabilities were strongly in favor of S2, also
underlined by the observation of low occupancy in
the slow state S1 and high affinity for switching to
S2.
The data and methods presented contribute to a more
precise characterization of physiological states and
molecular interactions of β2AR. We believe that our
findings enable the research of fine-grained
differences between other conditions that manipulate
β2AR signaling and can easily be adapted to other
GPCRs.

Material and Methods

Dye Preparation
The fluorescent SNAP-tag substrate BG-CF640R was
synthesized by amidization reaction of BG-NH2
(New England Biolabs #S9148S) and CF640R-NHS
ester (Biotium #92108). High-performance liquid
chromatography was conducted to purify the desired
reaction product (see Supporting Information), as
verified by subsequent MALDI-TOF measurement
(m/z = 1085.24).
To enrich BG-CF640R, the corresponding HPLC
fraction was subjected to a RP-18 solid phase
extraction. Phosphoric acid-containing eluent was
removed by washing with water. BG-CF640R was
then eluted with a mixture of methanol and ethanol.
The eluate was dried using a vacuum centrifuge.
A stock solution of BG-CF640R in DMSO was
prepared to a concentration of 400 µM and stored at 20°C. For labeling, the stock solution was diluted in
water to a concentration of 4 µM and stored at 4°C.

Cell culture and transfections
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were obtained
from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). HEK βarrestin-KO cells were kindly provided by Asuka
Inoue (Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Science,
Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8578, Japan). Both

cell lines were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in
DMEM medium (Gibco #31885-023) containing
10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies #10270),
100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.
The plasmid coding for SNAP-β2AR was obtained
from New England Biolabs (#N9184). Transfection
was done by calcium phosphate transfection method:
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates and allowed to
attach for at least 24 hours. One µg plasmid DNA
was mixed with 6.5 µl of a 2M aqueous CaCl2
solution and 50 µl sterile water, and then added
dropwise to a two fold HBS buffer (pH 7.13, 42 mM
HEPES, 274 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.4 mM
Na2HPO4, 15 mM glucose). The mixture was added
to the cells after 30 minutes. On the next day, the
medium was changed to fresh DMEM containing 750
µg/ml G418 for selection. Individual clones were
selected in cloning rings and seeded in distinct wells
in a 12-well plate. The clone with the best expression
of SNAP-β2AR was identified by fluorescence
microscopy and used for all experiments.
To obtain β-arrestin2 expression vectors with Nand C-terminal fusion to Cerulean, respectively,
sequence information for β-arrestin2 was amplified
by PCR using the plasmid pECFP-N1_rβ-Arrestin-2
(a kind gift from Prof. Lohse – University of
Wuerzburg, Germany21) as a template. PCR products
were cloned into pCerulean-N and pCerulean-C by
using NheI and AgeI restriction sites. All constructs
were verified by DNA sequencing. DNA was
transiently transfected into HEK SNAP-β2 β-arr-KO
cells by electroporation with the Amaxa Nucleofector
II device (Lonza). The included program Q-001 is
designed for high expression levels in HEK cells and
was used according to the manufacture’s protocol.
Single particle microscopy experiments were carried
out three days after transfection. Cells expressing
cerulean-tagged β-arrestin2 were identified by
fluorescence microscopy and used for all
experiments.

For experiments, cells were seeded in 12-well plates
on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips using clear
DMEM medium (no phenol red, Gibco #11880-028).
Coating was performed by pre-incubating wells prior
to seeding, using 500 ng/µl fibronectin in PBS for
two hours at 37°C, then washing twice with PBS.
Fibronectin coating improved cell adhesion and
growth compared to poly-D-lysine coating, especially
in the knockout cell line.

Experiments were performed two or three days after
seeding, at a confluency of about 80%. For
fluorescence microscopy, SNAP-β2AR overexpressed in HEK cells were fluorescently labeled by
preparing a solution of 2.5 µM BG-CF640R in clear
medium and incubating at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 30
minutes. This was followed by three washing steps
with clear medium, and a change to HBSS buffer
(Gibco #14025050) for imaging. The coverslip was
then placed in a custom made mounting bracket and
imaged at 25°C.

settings: 1.32 px spot radius, 3 frame rolling window
time-averaging for local maxima detection, 2 frame
minimum track segment length, 1 frame maximum
gap length, other settings on default.
Gaps were afterwards closed by linear interpolation,
and the resulting particle tracks pooled by
experimental condition and evaluated using scripts
described in the following.

Analysis of diffusion behavior
Single particle microscopy
Single particle microscopy was performed using an
inverted wide-field epi-fluorescence microscope
(TE2000- S, Nikon, Kanagawa, Japan), equipped
with a 60x water-immersion objective (Plan Apo VC,
1.2 NA, Nikon), a 200-mm-focal-length tube lens, a
4x-magnification lens (VM Lens C-4x, Nikon) and a
EMCCD camera (iXon DV-860DCSBV, Andor
Technology). For fluorescence excitation, a 637 nm
continuous wave laser (Coherent) was set to 20%
intensity 0.7 kW/cm2 in the object plane) using an
acousto-optical tunable filter (A.A SA, France). The
recording conditions were kept constant for all
measurements (1000 frames at 20 Hz, continuous
illumination and camera exposure, constant camera
gains and readout speeds).
The SNAP-tag labeling procedure described above
was altered to achieve sparse labeling. For
appropriate spot densities and lower background
signal, a five minute incubation using only 10 nM
SNAP-tag dye was optimal. After labeling and
washing, the cells were immediately imaged at 20°C
and used no longer than 60 minutes. In this time, 20
individual cells were recorded using the following
procedure: A cell was centrally positioned in the
bright-field channel and focused to the apical
membrane. Then, the EM channel and laser were
activated and the focus briefly fine-tuned before
starting the image acquisition. Cells showing either
unusually low spot densities or areal fluorescent
artifacts were generally discarded.

Spot tracking
The MATLAB software (version R2016b,
MathWorks) was used for the generation of 2D
particle tracks from image data and further diffusion
analysis. Images were directly imported by the utrack package22 and processed using the following

We implemented the package @msdanalyzer23 to
calculate mean squared displacement (MSD) values
for each track. MSD is calculated as in eq. 1, with r(t)
as the particle's position at time t, N as number of
positions in the trajectory and m∆t as the variable
time lag, a multiple of the frame interval.

[1]

Short-term diffusion coefficients of labeled receptors
were then derived by linear fitting of the first four
MSD points (eq. 2), weighted by number of distances
in each MSD value. Tracks of less than 8 frames or
low fit goodness (r2adj < 0.85) were excluded.

To identify discrete diffusive states from particle
tracks, variational Bayes single particle tracking was
applied using the vbSPT Matlab package18 . Tracks
were thereby segmented and variably classified to
one of three states according to their momentary
diffusion speed. Higher order models were
recognized by the program but not used, since they
resulted in degenerate states of insignificant
occupancy and indistinct diffusion behaviour (Figure
2, supplemental material).
The introduction of a fourth state to the model leads
to the addition of a nearly unpopulated immobile
state S1, and the detection of higher diffusion
coefficients in the other three states. MSD analysis of
the segments corresponding to each state showed that
on longer timescales, S1 and S2 in the four-state
model were degenerate, since short- and long-term

diffusion were extremely similar. Higher order
models also showed one or more degenerate states.

Track simulations and confinement analysis
2.
Tracking data resembling Brownian molecular
motion was simulated as follows: 500.000 tracks
were generated for each diffusion coefficient (D1 =
0.011 µm²/s, D2 = 0.038 µm²/s, D3 = 0.12 µm²/s) at a
frame interval of 50 ms. All generated spots were
subjected to localization error by a normally 3.
distributed positional offset with σ = 20 nm in each
dimension. To account for photobleaching, the track
lengths were modeled by an exponential distribution
with μD1 = 21.3 frames, μD2 = 9.8 frames, μD3 = 7.1
frames with a minimal track length of 2 frames. 4.
Values for D and µ were derived from averaged
vbSPT analysis results of the real data (β2AR under
non-stimulating and stimulating conditions).
For the analysis of confinement, the previously 5.
classified track segments were extracted and pooled
by their respective diffusion states. The recently
introduced packing coefficient Pc14 was used as a
measurement of spatial confinement strength. It is
defined in a given time window as the sum of
squared displacements divided by the squared convex
hull area formed by the included particle positions. A 6.
window length of 10 points (0.5 s) was chosen, which
should be long enough to yield stable results (see Fig.
5 in 14) and still include sufficient numbers of track
segments. To determine Pc95-values given by the 95th
percentile of packing coefficients, random walk data
based on the previously determined vbSPT state 7.
diffusion coefficients and segment lengths was
simulated. The derived Pc95-values were then used as
a threshold for spatial confinement. Confined tracks
(Pc > Pc95) were then compared by their average hull
areas, again by averaging on the 0.5 s timescale.
