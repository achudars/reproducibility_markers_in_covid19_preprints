ABSTRACT
Primary cilia are ubiquitous antenna-like organelles that mediate cellular signaling and represent
hotspots for human diseases termed ciliopathies. How signaling subcompartments are established
within the microtubule-based organelle, and for example support Hedgehog or cGMP signal
transduction pathways, remains a central question. Here we show that a C. elegans salt-sensing
receptor type guanylate cyclase, GCY-22, accumulates at a very high concentration within the distal
region of the cilium. This receptor uses DAF-25 (Ankmy2 in mammals) to cross the transition zone
(TZ) membrane diffusion barrier in the proximal-most region of the ciliary axoneme. Targeting of
GCY-22 to the ciliary tip is dynamic, requiring the cargo-mobilizing intraflagellar transport (IFT)
system. Disruption of transit across the TZ barrier or IFT trafficking causes GCY-22 protein
mislocalization and defects in the formation, maintenance, and function of the ciliary tip compartment
required for chemotaxis to low NaCl concentrations. Together, our findings reveal how a previously
undescribed cilium tip cGMP signaling compartment is established and contributes to the
physiological function of a primary cilium.

INTRODUCTION
The primary cilium is a specialized signaling organelle used by metazoan cells to receive and
propagate cues from their environment. The receptor and signaling proteins that enable cilia to
perform their functions must reach and remain at their correct sub-ciliary position and concentration.
Defects in the localization and/or functions of ciliary signaling components are associated with a wide
range of diseases, including multi-syndromic Bardet-Biedl (BBS), Meckel, and Joubert syndromes
(Reiter & Leroux 2017). However, our understanding of the regulation of protein localization in cilia
from different cell types, and their relevance to creating functional signaling domains, is limited.
Cilia use at least two major mechanisms, a trafficking system and a diffusion barrier, that function
together to dynamically regulate the trafficking of proteins into, out of, and within cilia. The main
trafficking machinery used by cilia is called intraflagellar transport (IFT). This system facilitates the
bidirectional transport of ciliary cargo, including signaling proteins, from the base/foundation of the
organelle (basal body) to the tip of the ciliary axoneme (Lechtreck 2015). Anterograde movement of
IFT trains to the tip is propelled by kinesins, and a cytoplasmic dynein enables retrograde transport
back to the base. Two IFT modules, termed subcomplexes A and B, as well as another module
containing BBS proteins (BBSome) that is thought to bridge the two subcomplexes, play essential
roles in cargo transport (Liu & Lechtreck 2018; Klink et al. 2017). The best-known IFT cargos are
structural components of the axoneme, including tubulin (Hao et al. 2011), but signaling proteins,
such as the C. elegans TRPV channel subunits OSM-9 and OCR-2, have also been identified as IFT
cargos (Qin et al. 2005). Additionally, several mammalian ciliary signaling proteins, namely the GPCR
SSTR3 and the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling component SMO, are known to traverse the cilium by both
IFT and diffusion (Ye et al. 2013).
To help confine proteins to cilia, a diffusion barrier for both membrane and soluble proteins is present
at the ciliary base (Ye et al. 2018; Prevo et al. 2015; Ludington et al. 2013). For membraneassociated proteins, this functionality is ascribed to the transition zone (TZ), a ciliary subdomain
immediately distal to the basal body. How the TZ acts with the IFT system to influence the movement
of proteins across this region and regulate the composition of the sensory organelle is not well
understood.
Signaling proteins can have different sub-ciliary localizations, including the proximal or distal
segments, or ciliary tip. For example, in the cilia of C. elegans the cyclic nucleotide gated channel
TAX-2 localizes to the proximal region adjoining the transition zone (Wojtyniak et al. 2013). Other
proteins, like the TRPV channel subunits OSM-9 and OCR-2 (Qin et al. 2005) and several GPCRs
(Kim et al. 2009; McGrath et al. 2011; Wojtyniak et al. 2013), localize along the length of the cilium. In
mammals, the kinesin-like protein KIF7 and the Hh signaling components SUFU and GLI2 localize at
the cilium tip (Liem et al. 2009; Endoh-Yamagami et al. 2009; He et al. 2014). Mislocalization of ciliary
proteins can have serious repercussions for signaling and development. For example, mislocalization
of PDE6 and GRK1 in mammalian photoreceptor cells can lead to retinitis pigmentosa (Zhang et al.
2014) and mice mutant for the BBSome subunit BBS2 exhibit neurosensory defects and retinopathy,
presumably caused by mislocalized rhodopsin (Nishimura et al. 2004). Another compartment, present
in the proximal region of the cilium, uses Inversin (NPHP2) and other proteins to modulate Wnt
signaling (Lienkamp et al. 2012). Despite their importance, the mechanisms that govern how signaling
components concentrate along specific regions of cilia, rather than their entire length, remain
unknown.
To explore these important aspects of cellular signaling, we use the cilium-dependent response of
C. elegans to NaCl as a model to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of signaling
domain formation, maintenance and function. In C. elegans, attraction to NaCl is mediated by the two

bilateral ASE (Amphid Single ciliated ending E) head neurons, which express multiple receptor-type
guanylate cyclases, including gcy-14 (ASEL) and gcy-22 (ASER) (Ortiz et al. 2009; Ortiz et al. 2006;
Etchberger et al. 2007). Behavioral and Ca2+ imaging experiments indicate that GCY-22 is required for
the response to Cl-, and GCY-14 for responding to Na+ (Ortiz et al. 2006; Ortiz et al. 2009; Smith et al.
2013).
By endogenously tagging GCY-22 with GFP, we discovered that the guanylate cyclase is present at a
high concentration in a cilium tip compartment. We demonstrate that this GCY-22 localization
depends on the IFT machinery, including the BBS complex. We further show that DAF-25, the
ortholog of the poorly-studied mammalian protein Ankmy2, is required for GCY-22 entry into the
cilium, and hence localization to the tip compartment. Using structure-function studies, we identified
GCY-22 protein domains required for cilium entry and localization at the tip. Disrupting the localization
of the receptor at the tip compartment hinders the ability of C. elegans to detect low concentrations of
NaCl. On the whole, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the formation and maintenance of a
novel ciliary subdomain essential for cGMP-mediated cellular signaling.
RESULTS
GCY-22::GFP is highly concentrated at the ASER ciliary tip and periciliary membrane
compartment
We used CRISPR/Cas9 to endogenously tag the gcy-22 gene with GFP and determine the subcellular localization of this receptor-type guanylate cyclase in the ASER neuron. Confocal microscopy
and co-labeling with markers for the ER (tram-1) and trans Golgi (apt-9) revealed that GCY-22::GFP
is present within the ER and trans-Golgi compartment in the cell body (Fig.1A, Sup. Fig. 1.). In the
dendrite, time-lapse imaging revealed anterograde and retrograde transport of GCY-22::GFP (Sup.
Fig. 2.), reminiscent of kinesin and dynein-mediated transport of vesicles (Mondal et al. 2011). At the
end of the dendrite, GCY-22::GFP is abundant at the periciliary membrane compartment (PCMC), a
vestibule of the cilium (Fig. 1A).
The most striking localization of GCY-22::GFP in ASER is in the cilium, where GCY-22::GFP is highly
enriched at the ciliary tip (Fig. 1A), but not along the length of the axoneme where most other
receptors analyzed thus far are located (L’Etoile & Bargmann 2000; Birnby et al. 2000; Takeishi et al.
2016). We expressed GCY-22::GFP under an ASI specific promoter to determine if the tip localization
is cell type dependent. GCY-22::GFP localized to the ciliary tip in low amounts (Fig 1B), suggesting a
mechanism that is possibly not cell specific.
The strong fluorescent signal at the tip of ASER cilia suggested the presence of a large number of
GCY-22::GFP molecules. Using a purified GFP sample as reference, we estimated the concentration
of GCY-22::GFP in the cilium tip to be 2.77 mM, reflecting a density of approximately 110,575
(±31,998) molecules/μm2 (Fig. 1C). The only example of a receptor with a comparable density we are
aware of is rhodopsin in the disks of the rod outer segment of the mammalian photoreceptor. In these
cilia, rhodopsin is present at densities of up to 48,300 molecules/μm2 (Fotiadis et al. 2003; Niu &
Mitchell 2005), which allows the photoreceptors to respond to single photons (Rieke & Baylor 1998).
This suggests that the ciliary tip compartment of the ASE neurons could function as a highly sensitive
detector of NaCl.
GCY-22::GFP exists in stable pools at the periciliary membrane and ciliary tip
To determine how the pools of GCY-22::GFP present at the ciliary tip and PCMC are replenished, we
used a Fluorescent Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) assay. Recovery of GCY-22::GFP after
photobleaching of the entire ciliary tip was modest (7% after 25 min) indicating little or slow transport

towards the cilium tip (Fig. 2A). Recovery after photobleaching of the entire PCMC (28% after 25 min)
was faster than at the ciliary tip, potentially reflecting continuous transport of GCY-22::GFP from the
cell body to the dendritic terminus (Fig. 2B).
To determine the motility of GCY-22::GFP within the ciliary tip and the PCMC, we photobleached half
of these compartments. Within the ciliary tip, fluorescence was maximally recovered in 3-4 minutes
(t1/2 = 54.89 sec.) and showed complete redistribution of GCY-22::GFP within the tip (Fig. 2C),
demonstrating lateral diffusion within the tip compartment. Partial photobleaching of GCY-22::GFP at
the PCMC resulted in recovery of fluorescence in 60 seconds (t1/2=11.43 sec.) (Fig. 2D), significantly
faster than in the ciliary tip. Together, these data show that GCY-22 is present in the PCMC and
cilium tip of ASER in large and stable pools, suggesting that there is limited, or slow, exchange
between these compartments. The motility of GCY-22::GFP within the ciliary tip appears more
restricted than at the PCMC.
Ciliary tip compartment of GCY-22::GFP depends on active IFT
Because the proximal region of the axoneme (middle segment) and part of the distal segment of the
cilium seemed void of GCY-22::GFP, we hypothesized that it might be actively transported from the
PCMC to the ciliary tip by the IFT machinery. In C. elegans, the IFT machinery relies on two kinesins
(kinesin-II and OSM-3) for anterograde movement along the middle segment and on OSM-3 alone for
transport within the distal segment of the axoneme.
Using time-lapse microscopy and kymograph analysis, we identified GCY-22::GFP particles moving
between the PCMC and ciliary tip (Fig. 3A). To determine if the GCY-22::GFP particles are
transported by the IFT machinery, we performed two-color imaging of GCY-22::GFP and an mCherrytagged version of the OSM-3 anterograde IFT kinesin, the ortholog of mammalian KIF17 (Fig. 3B).
These experiments showed GCY-22::GFP anterograde tracks overlapping with those of OSM3::mCherry. We observed on average 37.8 (± 8.4) anterograde OSM-3::mCherry tracks per minute
but only 6.14 (± 3.61) anterograde and 6.71 (± 3.71) retrograde GCY-22::GFP tracks per minute,
suggesting that only a subset of IFT particles is used to transport GCY-22::GFP as cargo (Table 1).
In contrast to IFT particles that often move along the full length of the cilium (average track length
2.75 ± 0.54 μm), anterograde GCY-22::GFP particles display shorter tracks, spanning half of the
cilium or shorter (average track length 1.0 ± 0.4 μm, P<0.001, Fig. 3C). Retrograde transport of GCY22::GFP was also observed, in short tracks and occasionally in tracks spanning the entire axoneme,
together averaging 1.3 ± 0.8 μm in length (Fig. 3C). These are significantly shorter than retrograde
tracks from the core IFT protein, OSM-3 (average track length 2.12 ± 0.59 μm, P<0.001). In many
animals, particles appeared to pause halfway along the cilium, as indicated by a stationary
fluorescence signal in the kymograph that possibly reflects the end of the middle segment (Fig. 3A).
Interestingly, the GCY-22::GFP tracks frequently changed from a retrograde to an anterograde
direction, docking with an anterograde OSM-3::mCherry track and moving towards the tip
compartment (Fig. 3B). This is notable, as this behavior is not observed for core IFT proteins. These
data suggest that GCY-22::GFP particles that move from the tip into the cilium are targeted back to
the tip by the anterograde IFT machinery, keeping the GCY-22::GFP clear of the ciliary axoneme and
concentrated at the tip.
To study the contribution of IFT to cilium tip localization, we visualized the localization of GCY22::GFP in different IFT mutant backgrounds. Disruption of the anterograde kinesin-II subunit KAP-1,
which plays a role in entry of IFT particles into the cilium (Oswald et al. 2018), did not affect GCY22::GFP levels in the cilium or its localization (Fig. 3D,E). In this kap-1(ok676) mutant, the middle and
distal segments are present, as the remaining OSM-3-kinesin can transport cargo to the cilium tip and

build the entire axoneme. In contrast, the osm-3(p802) mutant, which lacks functional OSM-3 and
therefore a distal segment, has no GCY-22::GFP at the tip of the middle segment and shows
increased levels of GCY-22::GFP in the PCMC and along the remaining axoneme (Fig. 3D,E). Loss of
BBS-8, a subunit of the BBSome complex believed to act as an adaptor between the IFT machinery
and some cargo proteins (Nakayama & Katoh 2018), reduced the overall level of GCY-22::GFP in the
cilium, including at the tip, while increasing the amount of the guanylate cyclase along the length of
the cilium (Fig. 3D,E). The changes in GCY-22::GFP localization in osm-3(p802) and bbs-8(nx77)
mutants correlate with a significant decrease in GCY-22::GFP tracks (Table 1), suggesting that loss of
OSM-3 or BBS-8 alters the transport dynamics of cargo proteins such as GCY-22::GFP. Taken
together, our results show that the kinesin-II subunit KAP-1 is not required for import of GCY-22::GFP
into the cilium, and that both OSM-3 mediated IFT and the BBSome are important for its transport in
the cilium and enrichment at the tip.
We reasoned that if IFT is responsible for the ciliary tip localization of GCY-22::GFP, interrupting the
transport machinery should alter or abolish GCY-22::GFP tip localization. To test this, we used NaN3
to stop ATP production and as a result stop IFT over time. OSM-3::mCherry particles slowed down
and became less frequent after 10 minutes of NaN3 treatment (Fig. 4A). IFT capacity, which we define
as the number of IFT tracks multiplied by their speed, reached 0 after 30-50 min of NaN3 treatment
(Fig. 4B). During treatment, the length of the cilium steadily shortened, while the GCY-22::GFP
compartment started to extend into the cilium after 10 minutes in some animals and completely
collapsed after 20-30 minutes of NaN3 treatment (Fig. 4A,B). Importantly, the loss of cilium tip
localization after 30 minutes of NaN3 treatment was reversible, with complete recovery of the cilium tip
within 16 minutes (Fig. 4C). These experiments suggest that a certain minimal IFT capacity is
required to maintain GCY-22::GFP localization at the cilium tip, although we cannot exclude that the
effect of NaN3 treatment might be mediated by an IFT-independent mechanism. Additionally, GCY22::GFP relocalization into the cilium during NaN3 treatment occurs abruptly whereas cilium length
changes gradually, suggesting that these are independent processes.
Taken together, these experiments show that IFT plays an important role in actively maintaining the
high GCY-22 concentration at the ciliary tip.
GCY-22 trafficking and cilium import is regulated by the transition zone and requires DAF-25
The accumulation of a large pool of membrane-associated GCY-22::GFP at the PCMC suggests that
the guanylate cyclase is prevented from readily diffusing into the cilium. The transition zone, just distal
to the PCMC, is thought to form a membrane diffusion barrier that creates a ciliary membrane
compartment distinct from that of the cell body and PCMC (Garcia et al. 2018). We therefore tested
the hypothesis that the TZ restricts ciliary entry of GCY-22::GFP.
We first tested whether ablation of the TZ allows for GCY-22::GFP entry into the cilium. Surprisingly,
loss of MKS-5 (a mammalian RPGRIP1/RPGRIP1L ortholog), which removes all known proteins from
the TZ as well as the characteristic Y-link structures (Williams et al. 2011; Brear et al. 2014), has a
relatively subtle effect on GCY-22::GFP localization. GCY-22::GFP mislocalized at the TZ and base of
the ciliary axoneme and the amount localizing at the cilium tip was reduced (Fig. 3D,E). We did not
see increased entry of GCY-22::GFP molecules, suggesting that the TZ is not the only mechanism
preventing GCY-22::GFP entry into the cilium.
The Ankmy2 protein DAF-25 was previously identified as required for ciliary localization of guanylate
cyclases (Jensen et al. 2010; Fujiwara et al. 2010; Brear et al. 2014), cyclic nucleotide gated channels
and GPCRs (Wojtyniak et al. 2013; Brear et al. 2014), but not for IFT (Jensen et al. 2010). To study if
DAF-25 contributes to the trafficking of GCY-22::GFP into the cilium, we introduced GCY-22::GFP

into daf-25(m362) animals. Remarkably, GCY-22::GFP did not enter the cilium and we observed no
GCY-22::GFP IFT tracks and no ciliary tip localization in these mutant animals (Fig. 3D-E, Table 1.)
Interestingly, daf-25(m362) animals showed lower levels of GCY-22::GFP at the PCMC and only very
few moving vesicles and diffuse fluorescence in the dendrite (Fig. 3E, Sup. Fig. 2.). In the cell body,
GCY-22::GFP localization was more dispersed than in WT animals, and did not overlap with the
trans-Golgi marker APT-9::mCherry (Sup. Fig. 1, 3). These results suggest that DAF-25 plays a role
in early trafficking, as well as facilitating the entry of GCY-22::GFP into the cilium.
To test if DAF-25 functions together with the TZ to traffic GCY-22::GFP into the cilium, we generated
a daf-25(m362); mks-5(tm3100) mutant strain. In this double mutant, we observed low levels of GCY22::GFP in the cilium but no cilium tip compartment was formed (Fig. 3D,E). Very few IFT tracks of
GCY-22::GFP were visible, potentially explaining the lack of cilium tip localization (Table 1). Because
OSM-3 mediated IFT is not affected in daf-25(m362); mks-5(tm3100) animals (Table S1), MKS-5 and
DAF-25 may be required to link GCY-22::GFP to the IFT machinery, allowing for the formation of the
cilium tip compartment.
Together, our data show that DAF-25 is required for transport of GCY-22::GFP to the cilium and
facilitates import across the TZ, and together with MKS-5 is involved in loading GCY-22::GFP as IFT
cargo.
GCY-22::GFP localization requires its dimerization and RD3-associated domains
To identify protein domains required for the correct trafficking of GCY-22::GFP to the cilium tip, we
generated a series of deletion constructs. Several domains can be recognized in GCY-22, including
an extracellular receptor domain which possibly provides specificity for Cl- ions (Ortiz et al. 2009;
Smith et al. 2013). However, which protein domains are involved in its localization remains
unexplored. We deleted the extra-cellular receptor domain and signaling peptide, or, the intra-cellular
guanylate cyclase domain, dimerization domain, or c-terminal tail. Of these GFP-tagged deletion
constructs, only the dimerization domain proved to be required for cilium entry (Fig. 5).
In addition, GCY-22 contains a protein domain at its C-terminus which shows homology to the RD3binding domain identified in the mammalian guanylate cyclase GUCY2D/GC1 (Azadi et al. 2010). In
mammals, the protein RD3 (Retinal Degeneration 3) is required for the localization of guanylate
cyclase GUCY2D to the photoreceptor outer segment and has been implicated in the eye-specific
ciliopathy Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) (Zulliger et al. 2015). We made a deletion construct to
determine if this domain is required for the trafficking of GCY-22 to the tip of the cilium. In a gcy-22(lf)
background, GCY-22(∆RD3)::GFP was localized at the PCMC but did not enter the cilium (Fig. 5). To
confirm that the RD3 domain is required for cilium import, we replaced the 8 amino acids (W1042I1049) of this domain with alanine residues in the GFP-tagged, endogenous gcy-22 locus using
CRISPR/Cas9 (GCY-22(RD3-Ala)::GFP). Mutation of the RD3 domain completely abolished ciliary
entry (Fig. 3D,E). We also observed changes in the localization in the cell body and the dendrite,
reflecting a potential defect in the routing of GCY-22(RD3-Ala)::GFP (Sup. Fig. 3).
Next, we tested if the RD3 domain is sufficient for cilium entry by generating two constructs containing
the RD3 domain fused to the transmembrane (TM) domain and GFP, in two orientations: TM-RD3GFP and TM-GFP-RD3. These proteins showed diffuse localization in the cell body, some vesicular
transport in the dendrite, and localization at the PCMC. We observed a very weak signal in the cilium
but could not detect transport by IFT (Fig. 5, Sup Fig. 4). These results suggest that the RD3 domain
is not sufficient for correct routing and import in the cilium.

In C. elegans, the RD3 orthologue is RDL-1. Disrupting RDL-1 function affects trafficking of GCYs
from the Golgi to the cilium, resulting in reduced levels of protein in the cilium and PCMC (MartínezVelázquez & Ringstad 2018). We observed reduced GCY-22::GFP levels in the PCMC but WT levels
in the cilium tip (Fig. 3D,E). In addition, the localization of GCY-22::GFP in the cell body and dendrite
was affected in rdl-1 animals (Sup. Fig 1, 3), in agreement with a function of RDL-1 in an early
trafficking pathway for GCYs.
In contrast to GCY-22::GFP, the guanylate cyclase DAF-11 localizes along the entire length of the
cilium in ASI, ASJ, ASK neurons (Jensen et al. 2010; Birnby et al. 2000). We replaced the TM domain
of GCY-22 with that of DAF-11 to see if the TM domain influences the specific localization of GCY-22.
The TM of DAF-11 had no apparent effect on cilium tip localization (Fig. 5).
Together, our data show that the dimerization domain and the RD3 domain are required for entry of
GCY-22 into the cilium. In addition, our data suggest that the RD3 domain is important, but not
sufficient for cilium entry. Deletion of any of the other GCY-22 protein domains by themselves did not
affect cilium tip localization, suggesting that this localization is regulated by the combined action of
several domains.
GCY-22::GFP cilium tip compartment is required for high NaCl sensitivity
The ASE neurons express several receptor-type guanylate cyclases, of which GCY-22 and GCY-14
appear to be most important for the detection of NaCl (Ortiz et al. 2009; Ortiz et al. 2006; Smith et al.
2013). We tested gcy-22(tm2364) and gcy-14(pe1102) loss-of-function mutants and a gcy-14; gcy-22
double mutant in a NaCl chemotaxis assay. In this quadrant assay, animals are tested for their
preference for a particular NaCl concentration (contained within two quadrants) versus no NaCl (in the
other two quadrants) (Wicks et al. 2000). gcy-22::GFP animals showed a wild type NaCl chemotaxis
response. The gcy-22(tm2364) mutation significantly affected the chemotaxis response to NaCl,
whereas the gcy-14 mutant showed no defect (Fig. 6A). The double mutant did not have a
significantly stronger defect than the gcy-22 single mutant, suggesting that GCY-22 is the most
important of the two guanylate cyclases in our NaCl chemotaxis assay (Fig. 6A).
To determine if the localization of GCY-22 at the cilium tip is important for C. elegans’ sensitivity to
NaCl, we first tested the IFT mutants for their chemotaxis response. kap-1(ok676) animals showed a
wild type response to NaCl (Fig. 6B), consistent with the normal localization of GCY-22::GFP at the
ciliary tip. bbs-8(nx77) animals showed reduced chemotaxis to 1 mM NaCl (P<0.01; Fig. 6B), which
correlates with the reduced levels of GCY-22::GFP at the ciliary tip. osm-3(p802) animals, which have
short cilia where GCY-22::GFP localizes along its entire length, showed the strongest chemotaxis
defect at all NaCl concentrations tested (P<0.01; Fig. 6B).
Next, we tested daf-25(m362) animals, which have no ciliary GCY-22::GFP, for their chemotaxis
response. These animals showed a very strong chemotaxis defect, with only a modest response to
the highest (100 mM) NaCl concentration (Fig. 6C). This suggests that daf-25 is required for the
trafficking and ciliary import of proteins essential for chemotaxis to NaCl, in accordance with the
mislocalization of guanylate cyclases and CNGs in this mutant (Fujiwara et al. 2010; Wojtyniak et al.
2013; Jensen et al. 2010). Surprisingly, mks-5(tm3100); daf-25(m362) double mutants showed a
partially restored response to 10 mM NaCl and a wild-type response to 100 mM (Fig. 6C). These
responses roughly correlate with the levels of GCY-22::GFP in the cilium in these mutants, and
suggest that the levels of GCY-22::GFP that entered the cilium in the double mutant are sufficient for
detecting high NaCl concentrations.

Together, our findings provide evidence that a high level of GCY-22 at the ciliary tip is required for
highly sensitive NaCl detection. However, the possibility remains that in the mutants analyzed, other
proteins that play a role in NaCl sensory transduction are affected, leading to the observed
chemotaxis defects.
To specifically test the contribution of GCY-22::GFP ciliary tip localization to NaCl sensation, we
tested the RD3-Ala mutant animals for their chemotaxis response. These animals showed a mild
chemotaxis defect at 1 mM NaCl (P=0.023), but wild-type responses to 10 and 100 mM NaCl (Fig.
6D). The WT responses of the RD3-ala mutant animals at higher concentrations suggest that a small
amount of GCY-22 could still be present in the cilium, or that the localization at the PCMC is sufficient
for at least some of the animals’ response to NaCl. Additionally, a chemotaxis defect in these animals
could be masked by functional redundancy between the many guanylate cyclases. To test this latter
possibility, we made a gcy-14(pe1102); gcy-22(RD3-Ala) double mutant and observed a stronger
chemotaxis defect at 10 mM NaCl (P=0.020) than the gcy-22(RD3-ala) single mutant (Fig. 6D).
Interestingly, gcy-14(pe1102); gcy-22(RD3-Ala) animals showed stronger chemotaxis to 100 mM
NaCl than gcy-14(pe1102); gcy-22(tm2364) animals (P=0.004), indicating that the GCY-22 protein in
which the RD3 domain has been replaced by Alanine residues is partially functional in detecting NaCl.
Together these experiments show that GCY-22 is required at the cilium tip for the detection, and
efficient chemotaxis to low concentrations of NaCl.
DISCUSSION
Several signaling proteins localize to specific ciliary subdomains, whereas others localize along the
length of the cilium, suggesting that these specific localizations are functionally important. Although
ciliary signaling is important in physiology and development, our understanding of how the localization
of signaling proteins within the cilium is regulated remains limited. Here, we identified mechanisms
involved in the localization of the putative Cl- receptor GCY-22 to a unique ciliary tip domain in the
ASER neuron of C. elegans, and provide evidence that this specific localization is required for its
function as a highly sensitive NaCl sensor.
Cilium entry
To function, GCY-22, trafficked to the periciliary membrane compartment, must cross the transition
zone (TZ) before reaching the cilium. The TZ is a highly organized structure that acts as a diffusion
barrier at the base of the cilium and prevents membrane-associated proteins from freely diffusing
across it (Garcia et al. 2018). By removing the core TZ scaffolding component MKS-5, the structure of
the TZ can be disrupted, presumably allowing proteins to enter the cilium more freely (Li et al. 2016;
Jensen et al. 2015). Unexpectedly, this resulted in less entry of GCY-22 into the cilium, indicating that
the TZ plays a role in import of GCY-22. In addition, we found that DAF-25, previously identified as
essential for the proper localization of ciliary signaling proteins, is required for GCY-22 import into the
cilium. Furthermore, we identified two domains within GCY-22 which, when deleted or mutated, affect
entry of GCY-22 into the cilium: the dimerization domain and the RD3-binding domain.
Cilium tip localization
Once inside the cilium, GCY-22 is transported to the tip. Our results suggest that IFT is the primary
driving force behind the sub-ciliary localization of GCY-22 at the cilium tip. Dual-color imaging of IFT
and GCY-22::GFP showed that GCY-22::GFP co-localizes with the kinesin OSM-3 in a subset of the
IFT particles, suggesting some accumulation of GCY-22::GFP in certain IFT particles or ‘trains’. Most
GCY-22::GFP tracks were significantly shorter than the IFT tracks, suggesting that cargo disembarks
along the length of the cilium. Strikingly, many GCY-22::GFP particles moving in a retrograde

direction (towards the base) were picked up by IFT trains moving in the anterograde direction and
relocalized to the tip. This behavior, not previously observed for other IFT-associated proteins,
maintains a high density of receptor molecules at this compartment. How this is regulated—for
example, whether this depends on differential affinity for the anterograde and the retrograde IFT
machinery—remains to be determined. We also showed that when we interfere with IFT, either by
using NaN3 or disrupting the IFT components bbs-8 or osm-3, accumulation of GCY-22::GFP at the
tip is less efficient. These results indicate that IFT could be the main mechanism forming and
maintaining the tip compartment. We cannot rule out that GCY-22 binds to other factors at the cilium
tip, however, to date no such factors have been identified in C. elegans or other systems. For
example, it remains unknown how components of Hedgehog signaling remain confined to the cilium
tip (reviewed in (He et al. 2017)). Our data suggests that IFT could play an important role in such
localizations by actively maintaining a specialized signaling compartment at the cilium tip.
To identify other proteins that play a role in the ciliary tip localization, we tested daf-25, mks-5, and
rdl-1 mutants. Only disrupting mks-5 reduced the localization of GCY-22 at the cilium tip, which can
be explained by the strongly reduced IFT mediated transport of GCY-22. Mutating daf-25 completely
abolished entry of GCY-22 into the cilium, making it unclear whether DAF-25 plays a role in tip
localization. A mks-5; daf-25 double mutant showed increased entry of GCY-22 compared to the daf25 single but still no tip localization, showing that the ciliary tip localization is daf-25 dependent.
However, it is also conceivable that other factors required for the formation of a cilium tip
compartment are missing in these mutants.
Finally, none of the GCY-22::GFP protein domains tested in our deletion constructs were specifically
required for cilium-tip localization. Such a function could however be masked by the lack of GCY22::GFP in the cilium when the RD3 and dimerization domains of GCY-22 were deleted or mutated.
Either of these domains could play a role in localization to the ciliary tip.
Ciliary proteins follow an intricate path from the ER and Golgi to their final destination in the cilium
(Ranjan et al. 2019; Chadha et al. 2019). It is possible that DAF-25 is not directly involved in linking
GCY-22 to the trafficking machinery, but instead is a more general component of the trafficking
mechanism of ciliary proteins.
NaCl sensing by the cilium tip compartment
Whether GCY-22 is the NaCl receptor of the ASER neuron remains an open question. So far, genetic
studies indicate that GCY-14 and GCY-22 confer specificity for NaCl in the ASE neurons (Ortiz et al.
2006; Ortiz et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2013). Notably, GCY-14 localizes similarly to GCY-22, i.e. to the
base and tip of the cilium in the ASEL neuron (Murayama et al. 2013), and given their effect on
chemotaxis to NaCl, GCY-14 and GCY-22 are likely the receptors of Na+ and Cl-, respectively.
However, mutating GCY-22 affects chemotaxis to multiple compounds, although the strongest
phenotype is in chemotaxis to NaCl (Ortiz et al. 2009). Others have suggested that a homodimer of
GCY-22 is the receptor for Cl- and that GCY-22 heterodimerizes with other GCYs in chemotaxis to
other salts (Ortiz et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2013). Furthermore, GCY-14 and GCY-22 contain all the
necessary amino acids to perform their function as homodimers (Murayama et al. 2013). We
generated GCY-22::GFP(RD3-ala), GCY-22::spmCherry heterozygous animals to show the presence
of GCY-22 homodimers. Because GCY-22::GFP(RD3-ala) proteins do not enter the cilium, a GFP
signal in the cilium tip would only be possible if GCY-22:GFP(RD3-ala) dimerized with GCY22::spmCh. We only detected mCherry in the cilium tip suggesting that GCY-22 does not form
homodimers or, more likely, that the RD3 domain is needed for dimerization and secondarily cilium
entry (data not shown).

The high concentration of GCY-22 at the ciliary tip suggests that the tip compartment is a highly
sensitive detection apparatus, reminiscent of the high protein densities of rhodopsin in the mammalian
photoreceptor cells and which are capable of detecting single photons (Baylor et al. 1979; Niu &
Mitchell 2005). Mislocalization of GCY-22::RD3-ala::GFP affected chemotaxis to 1 mM NaCl most,
suggesting that the ciliary tip compartment is required to navigate small differences in NaCl
concentrations. It would be interesting to test this mutant on an assay with a shallow gradient instead
of the steep gradient of our quadrant assay. In such an assay, the correct localization and high
density of GCY-22 in the cilium tip could prove more important. On the other hand, the high packing
density of rhodopsin limits lateral diffusion and slows the visual response (Calvert et al. 2001). Similar
dynamics of high packing density could explain the relatively slow diffusion of GCY-22::GFP in the
cilium tip, rather than binding to other cilium tip factors.
In the present study we investigated the role of a cGMP signaling compartment at the tip of a primary
cilium. We showed the transporting route the receptor-type guanylate cyclase takes from cell body to
the cilium tip, showed which protein domains are essential for correct localization of this receptor, and
identify IFT as a key mechanism in establishing and maintaining this cilium tip compartment. Finally,
we provide a first indication that the signaling compartment conveys high sensitivity to NaCl.
Methods
Strains and Constructs
Strains were cultured using standard methods (Brenner 1974). Alleles used in this research were:
kap-1(ok676), osm-3(p802), bbs-8(nx77), daf-25(m362), mks-5(tm3100). The Prab-3::mCherry::apt-9
construct was a gift from Angela Pasparaki and used for the cloning of Pgpa-4::mCherry::tram-1.
Microinjections
Microinjections were performed using standard methods (Mello & Fire 1995).
CRISPR/Cas9
To generate the osm-3::mCherry allele we injected animals with an injection mixture containing
PU6::osm-3_sgRNA, Peft-3::cas9-SV40_NLS::tbb-2, rol-6, and a plasmid containing the mCherry
template with 1500 bp homology arms. Animals were injected and placed on separate plates. Three
days later, F1 offspring was picked, allowed to self-reproduce, and screened by PCR.
We used the dpy-10 based the co-CRISPR method (Ward, 2015) and a PCR template of GFP with 35
bp homology arms to generate the gcy-22::GFP allele, and a ssODN template with 35 bp homology
arms to generate the gcy-22(RD3<Ala)::GFP and gcy-22::spmCherry alleles. We generated the rdl1(gj1989) allele using two sgRNAs and no template.
Microscopy
Animals were immobilized on a 6% agarose pad, 0.10 μm polystyrene microspheres (Polybead,
Polysciences Inc.), and 10 mM Levamisole (Sigma) in M9 buffer as an anesthetic, unless stated
otherwise.
Fluorescence images were taken using an inverted spinning disc confocal microscope (Nikon Tieclipse) with an EM CCD camera (QuantEM512C, Photometrics) and Metamorph Imaging software,
unless stated otherwise. Images were analyzed using FIJI software (version 2.0.0). For FRAP
experiments, a FRAP3D unit (ROPER) was used. For the time-lapse images, animals were
immobilized on a 6% agarose pad and M9 containing 10 mM Levamisole. Images were taken at
300ms intervals and Peterman plugins KymographClear 1.0. Kymograms were analyzed using a
custom FIJI plugin written by I. Smal. Dual color time-lapse images were taken using a DV2

beamsplitter (MAG Biosystems). Quantification of GCY-22::GFP fluorescence in different mutant
backgrounds, and of GFP molecules at the cilium tip, was performed on a laser scanning confocal
microscope (SP5 AOBS, Leica). A purified GFP sample (gift from G. Kremer) was used to generate a
calibration curve for the quantification of GFP.
NaN3
To stop ATP production, Sodium Azide (Sigma) was added to a 6% agarose pads at a concentration
of 20 mM. Imaging started 10 min after immobilization. Animals were incubated in a drop of M9
containing 20 mM NaN3 before proceding with standard immobilisation with microspheres and
Levamisol.
Chemotaxis assays
The quadrant assay used to asses chemotaxis to NaCl was adapted from Wicks et al. and Jansen et
al. (Wicks et al. 2000; Jansen et al. 2002). Briefly, two diagonally opposite quadrants of a sectional
petri dish (Star Dish, Phoenix Biomedical) were filled with 13.5 mL buffered agar (1.7% Agar, 5 mM
K2HPO4, 5 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgSO4) containing NaCl and two diagonally opposite
quadrants with 13.5 mL buffered agar without NaCl. Immediately before the assay, the plastic dividers
between the quadrants were covered with a thin layer of agar. Age synchronized C. elegans
populations were washed 3 times for 5 min with CTX buffer (5 mM K2HPO4, 5 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM
CaCl2 and 1 mM MgSO4). Approximately 100 animals were placed in the middle of a sectional dish.
After 10 min, animals on each quadrant were counted and a chemotaxis index (CI) was calculated for
each plate (CI = (# animals on NaCl – # animals not no NaCl)/ total # animals). To determine the CI of
a strain, 2 assays per day were performed for at least 3 days.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 3.6.0. For the chemotaxis assays a
one-way ANOVA was performed, followed by a pairwise-t-test with Holm correction for multiple
comparisons. FRAP curves were fitted using R software.

Figure 1. GCY-22::GFP localizes to the cell-body, is transported along the dendrite and
localizes to the PCMC and cilium tip in the ASER neuron.
(A) Schematic of the head of the animal showing the ASER cellbody, dendrite and cilium. Inserts:
Fluorescence images with GCY-22::GFP (green) and flp-6p::mCherry (red) showing localization in the
cell body, vesicle in the dendrite and localization to the PCMC and tip of the cilium. (B) Ectopic
expression of GCY-22::GFP in the ASI neuron showing localization at the PCMC and cilium tip. (C)
Quantification of GCY-22::GFP molecules at the cilium tip of the ASER neuron.
Figure 2. GCY-22::GFP localizes to stable pools at the PCMC and cilium tip. (A) Fluorescence
recovery after photobleaching the entire cilium tip compartment. (B) Fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching the entire PCMC. (C) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching half of the tip
compartment. (D) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching half of the PCMC.
Figure 3. The cilium tip compartment is actively maintained by IFT. (A) Kymogram of GCY22::GFP showing anterograde and retrograde transport and diffusion tracks. (B) Kymograms showing
overlap of IFT tracks of GCY-22::GFP (green) and OSM-3::mCherry (red). (C) Quantification of GCY22::GFP (green), OSM-3::mCherry (left graph, red), and XBX::tdTomato (right graph, red) tracks. (D)
