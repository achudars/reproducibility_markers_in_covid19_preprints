Summary
Reef-building corals live in a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic algae (family
Symbiodiniaceae) that usually provide most of the energy required by the coral host.
This relationship is sensitive to temperature stress; as little as a 1°C increase often
leading to collapse of the association. This sensitivity has led to interest in the
potential of more stress tolerant algae to supplement or substitute for the normal
Symbiodiniaceae mutualists. In this respect, the apicomplexan-like microalga
Chromera is of particular interest due to its greater temperature tolerance. We
generated a de novo transcriptome for a Chromera strain isolated from a GBR coral
(“GBR Chromera”) and compared to those of the reference strain of Chromera
(“Sydney Chromera”), and to those of Symbiodiniaceae (Fugacium, Cladocopium
and Breviolum), as well as the apicomplexan parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. By
contrast with the Symbiodiniaceae, the two Chromera strains had a high level of
sequence similarity evident by very low levels of divergence in orthologous genes.
Although KEGG categories provide few criteria by which true coral mutualists might
be identified, they do supply a molecular rationalization for the ubiquitous association
of Cladocopium strains with Indo-Pacific reef corals. The presence of HSP20 genes
may underlie the higher thermal tolerance of Chromera.

Introduction
The ecological success of reef-building corals is generally attributed to their ability to
establish mutualistic relationships with specific photosynthetic algae – members of
the dinoflagellate family Symbiodiniaceae (formerly, the genus “Symbiodinium”).
However, as is now widely appreciated, this relationship breaks down under

environmental stress, and coral reefs globally are under threat as a consequence of
the increasing frequency of weather events that exceed the thermal thresholds of
corals (Hughes et al., 2017). In addition to Symbiodiniaceae, a wide range of
uncharacterized eukaryotes are associated with corals, including apicomplexanrelated lineages (ARLs) (Clerissi et al., 2018) that can sometimes occur in high
abundance (Kwong et al., 2019). Two of these ARLs isolated in association with
corals, Chromera velia (Moore et al., 2008) and Vitrella brassicaformis (Obornik et
al., 2012), constitute the newly defined phylum Chromerida. As the closest free-living
relatives of the parasitic Apicomplexa, these photoautotrophic alveolates are of
considerable scientific interest (Moore et al., 2008). Whole genome sequencing (Woo
et al., 2015) has recently reaffirmed the close relatedness of Chromera and Vitrella.

The nature of the relationship between corals and Chromera has been a subject of
debate. Given its photosynthetic ability (Moore et al., 2008) and its ability to colonize
coral larvae (Cumbo et al., 2013), it was initially thought that Chromera might be an
alternative coral mutualist, potentially bringing the benefit of higher thermal tolerance
than most Symbiodiniaceae (Visser et al., 2012; Chakravarti et al., 2019). However,
several lines of evidence now imply otherwise. It has recently been shown that the
transcriptomic response of the coral host post Chromera uptake (Mohamed et al.,
2018) differed markedly from that of the same coral to a mutualistic strain of
Symbiodiniaceae (Mohamed et al., 2016), and resembled the response to
incompatible (“incompetent”) Symbiodiniaceae strains (Voolstra et al., 2009). The
apparently hostile responses of coral larvae to Chromera during infection suggested
that Chromera is more likely to be a parasite or a commensal of corals rather than a

mutualist (Mohamed et al., 2018). Other lines of evidence support this suggestion
(Barott et al., 2011; Janouškovec et al., 2012, 2013), including a recent metaanalysis which implies that Chromera is near exclusively associated with coral
biogenous sediments (Mathur et al., 2018).

The present work sought to address two specific issues, in both cases making use of
a de novo transcriptome assembly generated for a strain of Chromera isolated from
corals on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Whilst Chromera was originally isolated from
a Sydney Harbor coral, it is known to have a wide distribution (Janouškovec et al.,
2012; Visser et al., 2012), and the diversity within this monospecific genus has not
been systematically explored. Given the metabolic diversity that is now known to
exist (LaJeunesse et al., 2018) within what was previously known as “Symbiodinium”,
the extent to which conclusions about the coral-Chromera interaction based on the
GBR isolate are generalizable is unknown.

The first goal of the present study was therefore to estimate the degree of divergence
between the GBR strain of Chromera and that originally isolated from Sydney harbor.
Given the evidence that Chromera is unlikely to be a coral mutualist, the second goal
was to investigate the repertoires of genes that are thought to play roles in symbiosis
and environmental stress tolerance in Chromera and compare these with those of
three members of the Symbiodiniaceae. Cladocopium goreaui (formerly Clade C1
Symbiodinium) was isolated from a colony of Acropora tenuis on the GBR (Howells
et al., 2012), and is mutualistic with many Indo-Pacific corals, particularly Acropora
species. Breviolum minutum (formerly Clade B Symbiodinium) was isolated from the

Caribbean coral Orbicella faveolata, and is a mutualist of Caribbean corals.
Fugacium kawagutii (formerly Clade F Symbiodinium) was originally isolated in
association with the Hawaiian reef-building coral Montipora verrucosa and the initial
whole-genome analyses followed the assumption that Fugacium is a coral mutualist
(Lin et al. 2015). However, Fugacium failed to infect juvenile corals (Yuyama et al.,
2016), and the consensus now is that Fugacium is probably a surface associate of
corals rather than an endosymbiont (Liu el al., 2018; LaJeunesse et al., 2018;
González-Pech et al., 2019). Thus, the expectation was that, with respect to
metabolic repertoire, the Chromera strains would resemble Fugacium rather than the
known coral mutualists, Cladocopium and Breviolum. Whilst the results suggest that
small HSPs may account for the tolerance of Chromera to elevated temperatures,
they were inconclusive with respect to the nature of relationships between corals and
Chromera or Fugacium. The comparative analyses do, however, provide a molecular
rationalization for the near ubiquitous association of Cladocopium with Indo-Pacific
corals in general and with Acropora spp in particular.

Experimental procedures

Chromera culture and culturing conditions
A culture of Chromera (Mdig3 strain) from the University of Technology Sydney
(Cumbo et al., 2013) was used in this study and referred to as “GBR Chromera”. The
identity of the culture was confirmed both by microscopy and by using Chromeraspecific PCR primers (Supplementary information Figure 1, Table 1). This Chromera
strain was originally isolated from the stony coral Montipora digitata (Acroporidae)

from Nelly Bay, Magnetic Island on the inner central part of the Great Barrier Reef.
Cultures were maintained at 25 °C in Guillard’s f/2 medium on a 12 h/12 h day and
night regime. Note that Chromera was subjected to a variety of treatments prior to
RNA extraction in order to ensure that the transcriptome assembly captured as many
genes as possible. Culture conditions included control, dark stress, cold shock, heat
shock, motile and mixotrophic (for details see Supplementary Methods). In all cases,
exponentially growing cultures were separated and subjected to the treatment
condition and harvested at the end of the experimental treatment. During culturing no
antibiotics were used to exclude any potential contribution of the antibiotic treatment
to the mRNA expression in the cultures.

RNA isolation and high-throughput sequencing
50 mL of Chromera cultures were pelleted by spinning the cultures at 3,000 x g for 5
min. Pellets were suspended in 1 ml 0.2 μm sterile FSW and centrifuged at 3,000 x g
for 5 min. Pellets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further
treatment. Total RNA was isolated from ~80 mg of the frozen Chromera pellets using
the RNAqueous® Total RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). The pellets were lysed twice for
20s at 4.0 ms−1 in Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals, Australia) containing 960
µL of lysis/binding solution plus 80 µL of the Plant RNA Isolation Aid (Ambion, USA)
on a FastPrep®-24 Instrument (MP Biomedicals, Australia). RNA was bound to filter
cartridges supplied with the kit and washed three times, finally RNA was eluted in 40
µL of the elution solution. RNA quantity and quality were assessed using a NanoDrop
ND-1000 spectrometer, Qubit® 2.0 fluorometer and Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) was isolated from 1 µg of total RNA and 6 RNA-Seq

libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina).
Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at the Australian
Genome Research Facility (AGRF) in Melbourne, Australia. Sequencing produced a
total of 189.5 million individual 100 bp paired-end reads (Table 1).

Processing of Illumina data
The raw Illumina reads were filtered and adapters were clipped using
TRIMMOMATIC (v0.32) (Bolger et al., 2014). Reads were filtered based on quality
and size as follows; both universal and indexed Illumina adapters were clipped,
quality trimming was also performed by removing leading and trailing bases with
Phred quality score < 25 and average Phred quality score was calculated in 4 bp
sliding windows. Bases were trimmed from the point in the read where average
Phred quality score dropped below 20 (i.e. the chances that a base is called
incorrectly is 1 in 100) and reads of < 50 bp were also excluded.

De novo assembly and annotation of transcriptome
The trimmed/filtered Illumina reads were used for de novo transcriptome assembly
using Trinity (r20140717 version). The assembly was carried out with the
recommended protocol described in (Haas et al., 2013) and using options
appropriate for de novo transcriptome assembly of strand specific RNA-Seq libraries.
Minimum contig length of 500 and read normalization were specified. Trinity collects
transcripts with shared sequence identity into clusters that are loosely related to
genes. The longest isoform per cluster was selected using a custom Perl script from
the assembled Trinity output “assembled transcriptome” for the purpose of

annotation. Chromera contigs were annotated by similarity search using batch
BLASTX conducted locally against the Swiss-Prot protein database downloaded in
September 2014 (E-value cut off 10-3 and maximum 20 hits). Raw BLASTX outputs
were imported to Blast2GO suite (version 2.6.5) (http://blast2go.com/b2ghome) for
functional annotation and Gene Ontology (GO) assignment. KEGG analysis was
also performed using the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) (Moriya et al.,
2007) (http://www.genome.jp/kaas-bin/kaas_main) in order to obtain an overview of
the associated metabolic pathways. The bi-directional best hit (BBH) method was
used to obtain KEGG orthology (KO) assignments.

In order to validate the accuracy of the de novo assembly, reads were mapped back
to the de novo-assembled transcriptome using the BOWTIE aligner version 0.12.7
(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with default mapping parameters. The percent of
the mapped reads as proper pairs was used to assess the assembly quality.
Moreover, BLASTN (E-value of ≤ 10-10) was performed against bacterial genomes
downloaded from the GenBank, NCBI to determine the percentages of putative
bacterial transcripts in the dataset. The completeness of the transcriptome assembly
was assessed using BUSCO v3.1.0 making use of the function run_BUSCO.py (-mode transcriptome) with the Eukaryota_odb9, alveolate_stramenophile and
protists_ensembl data (retrieved 23 October 2019).

Phylogenomic analyses
A multi-gene phylogenetic analysis was performed to assess the relative
phylogenetic distance between Chromera strains and infer their evolutionary

relationship to other Apicomplexans and Symbiodiniaceae. The protein sequences of
GBR Chromera were predicted by Transdecoder (Haas et al., 2013). Transcript
nucleotide (CDS) and protein sequences for Chromera CCMP2878 strain “Sydney
Chromera” were downloaded from CryptoDB (release-37;
http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/), and for Plasmodium falciparum from PlasmoDB
(release-37; http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/). Corresponding data for Symbiodiniaceae
species were based on gene models from their respective genome sequencing
projects; specifically, Fugacium kawagutii (Lin et al 2015) was obtained from the
Symka Genome Database (http://web.malab.cn/symka_new/download.jsp),
Cladocopium goreaui (Liu et al 2018) from ReFuGe 2020 site
(http://refuge2020.reefgenomics.org/) and Breviolum minutum (Shoguchi et al., 2013)
from the OIST Marine Genomics online resource
(https://marinegenomics.oist.jp/symb/viewer/info?project_id=21).

The longest transcript for each gene was extracted for all six species and used to
infer orthologous clusters with OrthoFinder (Emms and Kelly, 2015). A total of 692
orthogroups were found to have representative genes in all species, and of these 172
consist of single-copy genes in each species; they represent strictly orthologous
gene sets. Amino acid sequences for these 172 orthologous sets were aligned using
MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and converted into corresponding codon
alignment by pal2nal (Suyama et al., 2006). Poorly aligned regions were removed
using trimAl based on distribution of gaps (Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009). Finally, IQTREE (Nguyen et al., 2015) was used to perform a partitioned phylogenetic analysis
allowing independent estimation of evolutionary model for each protein set. To

summarise the effect of phylogenetic relatedness on overlap between gene
repertoires the number of shared orthologs was calculated for all members of each
clade based on orthogroup information generated with OrthoFinder (see above).
Additionally, for each pair of taxa the orthogroup information was used to compute a
Hammings distance based on the ratio of the number of unshared orthogroups (those
unique to either taxon in the pair) to the total number of orthogroups shared by the
pair.

Comparative transcriptomics
Transcriptomes of Sydney Chromera, Fugacium, and the known mutualistic
Symbiodiniaceae (Cladocopium and Breviolum) were also mapped against the
KEGG database as previously performed for the GBR strain (using the bi-directional
best hit (BBH) method). Genes mapped to different KEGG categories were
calculated and compared. To better understand relationships between corals and
both Chromera and Fugacium, repertoires of genes in categories that are important
for symbiosis, such as ABC transporters, as well as those involved in processes such
as nitrogen metabolism and stress tolerance, were compared. The overlap amongst
these genes was plotted using the R package UpSetR https://github.com/hmsdbmi/UpSetR/ (Conway et al., 2017).

After confirming the identity of Chromera cultures using novel Chromera-specific
PCR primers, a transcriptome assembly was generated from 166 million paired-end
Illumina reads (~33 million per library; Table 2). The number of putative genes (39
457, based on the longest transcript isoform per Trinity gene cluster) identified in the
GBR Chromera isolate (Table 2) is comparable to those predicted for various
Symbiodiniaceae isolates (30 000-49 000) based on transcriptome and genome data
(Bayer et al., 2012;Shoguchi et al., 2013;Rosic et al., 2015;Aranda et al., 2016; Liu et
al. 2018 and Shoguchi et al., 2018), but is higher than the number predicted from the
Chromera genome of the reference strain (26 112 excluding TEs; Woo et al., 2015).
As only 19.4% of the GBR Chromera genes had significant BLASTX hits against the
Swiss-Prot protein database, the majority of Chromera genes code for unknown
functions. This level of novelty is to be expected for organisms such as chromerids
that are evolutionarily distant from well-characterized species, and has previously
also been observed with Symbiodiniaceae and other dinoflagellates (Lin et al.,
2010;Bayer et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2018). To assess the quality of the de novo
assembled transcriptome, reads were mapped to the assembly and an average of
84% of the paired Illumina reads were mapped successfully (Table 1). The
assembled transcriptome was judged to be relatively comprehensive on the basis of
high percentages of reads mapping.

5225 of Swiss-Prot annotated genes (68.35%) were assigned to 38271 GO terms.
Biological process (GO-BP) accounted for the majority of GO terms (22 205,
58.02%), followed by cellular component (GO-CC; 11 149, 29.1%) and molecular
function (GO-MF; 4 917, 12.8%). Functions involved in cellular process and

metabolic process (16% and 14%, respectively) were highly represented amongst
GO-BP. In GO-MF, the most represented terms were catalytic activity (46%) followed
by binding (36%). In GO-CC, the terms cell (39%) and organelle (33%) were highly
represented (Supporting information Figure 2). Most of the KEGG-based annotations
(34% of all assignments) were assigned to the metabolic pathway category, followed
by the human disease category (18% of all assignments) (Supporting information
Figure 3). Moreover, signal transduction and infectious diseases were the most
highly represented pathways (Supporting information Figure 4, Table 2).

Several different approaches were used in order to assess the completeness of the
assembled transcriptome. The KEGG annotation was searched for essential protein
complexes/ pathways and the majority of genes for the pathways were found.
Searched complexes included core cellular/ molecular protein complexes and
pathways such as Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, Ribosome, RNA polymerase,
Spliceosome and Proteasome (Supporting information Table 3 and Figures 5-9). The
use of BUSCO analysis resulted in a moderately high recovery (~60%) of conserved
eukaryotic genes and relatively low recovery (~26-46 %) of conserved alveolate and
protist genes, respectively, using default settings (Supporting information Table 4). In
addition, 0.1% of the assembled Chromera sequences (contigs) had BLASTN hits to
bacterial databases (E-value ≤ 10-10) indicating very low bacterial contamination.
Sequence and functional similarities of the two Chromera strains
Phylogenomic analyses based on 172 orthologous single copy genes revealed a
close relationship (branch length 0.07) between the GBR and Sydney strains of
Chromera compared with divergences between different species within the

Symbiodiniaceae (branch lengths 1.23 to 2.27) (Fig.1). Pairwise nucleotide similarity
between the Sydney and GBR Chromera isolates was 96.2%, whereas the
corresponding figures for the genera of Symbiodiniaceae were 72-78%. A close
relationship between the Chromera isolates was further supported by the presence of
a relatively large number (14645) of shared orthologous genes and an average
nucleotide identity of 99.12% based on alignments between these one-to-one
orthologs. The overall distributions of the six main KEGG categories were similar in
the two Chromera strains, one third of KEGG-annotated genes being assigned to
metabolism (Supporting information Figure 10). This might reflect broadly similar
functions and lifestyles. The only attempt to understand the nature of the coralChromera association used the Sydney strain (Mohamed et al., 2018). Given the
high level of similarity between the GBR and Sydney harbour strains, the responses
of corals to them are unlikely to differ significantly.

Focus on genes implicated in the symbiotic lifestyle
To gain additional perspectives on the coral-Chromera interaction, the assembled
transcriptomes for the Chromera strains were compared to those for Fugacium
(which is assumed to be non-mutualistic) and to those of Cladocopium and
Breviolum, which are mutualistic Symbiodiniacae strains, focusing on categories of
genes likely involved in symbiosis, particularly nitrogen metabolism, transport and
stress.

Metabolic exchanges in coral-algal symbioses

Nutrient exchange between the symbiotic partners is of major importance in coralSymbiodinium mutualisms (Meyer and Weis 2012, Davy et al., 2012, Lin et al., 2015,
Aranda et al., 2016). However, the nature of the translocated material(s) and
mechanisms underlying exchanges between the coral host and algal symbionts are
still unclear. To assess the potential for nutrient exchange between Chromera and
coral hosts, the representation of the KEGG pathways Nitrogen metabolism and
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were investigated in the two Chromera
strains and compared to those in the three members of the Symbiodiniaceae
(Fugacium, Cladocopium and Breviolum).

The Nitrogen metabolism category was investigated on the basis that nitrogen
cycling or conservation appears to be critical to the coral-Symbiodinium mutualism.
Nitrogen is thought to be a growth limiting factor in nutrient-poor tropical waters, and
many marine microbes have the ability to assimilate inorganic nitrogen (Pernice et
al., 2012), for a recent review see Radecker at al. (2015). The results of a survey of
genes captured under the KEGG pathway identifier KO00910 (Nitrogen metabolism)
are presented in Supporting information Table 4. Note that this KEGG pathway does
not include ammonium transporters, although it has previously been reported that the
genomes of Symbiodiniaceae encode multiple ammonium transport proteins (Aranda
et al., 2016).

In ocean waters, nitrate is generally the most abundant form of available nitrogen,
concentrations often being at least an order of magnitude higher than those of
ammonium and nitrite. However, in hospite, ammonium is likely to be the dominant

nitrogen source available to intracellular symbionts. Thus, facultative symbionts (as
most Symbiodiniaceae are thought to be) must not only be nutritionally versatile, but
also able to regulate genes involved in the transport and assimilation of different Nsources. As might be expected, all of the algae surveyed encode nitrate /nitrite
transporters as well as enzymes required for assimilation of nitrogen in these forms.
Although nitrate/nitrite transporters (NRTs) were present in all of the algae surveyed,
some differences were apparent. Whereas the NRTs of Breviolum, Fugacium and
Chromera were the MFS-type (K02575), this type was not detected in Cladocopium;
rather, in this organism, components (K15577 and K15579) of a distinct ABC-type
NRT were found. This difference may be significant; in cyanobacteria, the MFS-type
has high affinity for both nitrate and nitrite, whereas the ABC-type has a much higher
affinity for nitrate (Maeda and Omata, 2009).

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
The ABC class includes the largest number of transporters involved in either or both
uptake and export of a wide range of substrates, including inorganic ions,
carbohydrates and lipids. ABC transporters have been implicated in translocation of
nutrients and metabolites in cnidarian symbioses (Davy et al., 2012; Mathews et al.,
2017; Mohamed et al., 2019), and hence were an obvious focus for comparative
analyses.

As with the nitrogen metabolism category, surveying ABC transporter complements
(Fig. 2) was largely unsuccessful in providing general molecular criteria by which

commensals or parasites. One potentially significant difference, however, is that both
Breviolum and Cladocopium encode K10111 members, which are nominal
transporters of a variety of different sugars and which may be involved in
carbohydrate translocation in hospite, whereas proteins of this type were not
detected in either Fugacium or Chromera (Supporting information Table 5).
Unfortunately, the survey provides few other grounds for speculation about
photosynthate translocation. Whilst a number of candidates for roles in sterol or lipid
translocation were detected, these were generally not restricted to the coral
mutualists. For example, components of the mla/lin type transport system for
phospholipids/sterols/gamma-HCH (K02065 and K02066) were detected in
Fugacium as well as Cladocopium, and the Chromera ABC repertoire does include
possible sterol transporters (K05683, K05681, K08712).

Despite these analyses being uninformative on the issue of general characteristics of
mutualists, they do provide grounds for speculation about the near-ubiquitous
association of Cladocopium with Indo-Pacific corals (LaJeunesse et al., 2018) and
particularly with Acropora spp.. The ABC repertoire of Cladocopium by far exceeded
those of all of the other organisms surveyed (Fig. 2), and included many genes
identified only in this organism, amongst which were transporters for sugars, lipids
and amino acids as well as inorganic nutrients. A range of candidate amino acid
transporters were restricted to Cladocopium, one of which (HisP) is of particular
interest in the context of coral symbioses, as it encodes a histidine transport ATPbinding protein (Supporting information Table 6). The Cladocopium strain included
here was originally isolated from Acropora tenuis (Liu et al., 2018), a member of the

complex coral superfamily, and whereas robust corals (members of the other coral
superfamily) have a complete histidine biosynthetic pathway, complex corals (like all
other animals) must acquire this either from the diet or from their resident
endosymbionts (Ying et al., 2018). Also intriguing in the context of mutualism is the
detection only in Cladocopium of three components required for cystine transport
(K02424, K10009, K10010); the interest in these stems from the fact that, amongst
corals, members of the genus Acropora lack one of the enzymes required for
cysteine biosynthesis (Shinzato et al., 2011). In this respect, Acropora appears to be
unique; all other corals surveyed had a compete cysteine pathway. The presence of
an efficient cystine transport system may therefore underlie the near ubiquitous
association of Cladocopium C1 with Acropora spp.

Fugacium – an evolutionary recidivist?
The ABC transporters identified in Fugacium include several candidates for roles in
nutrient exchange – for example, K05641 encodes an ABCA1 protein known as
the cholesterol efflux regulatory protein (CERP) that mediates efflux of cellular
cholesterol and phospholipids (reviewed by Zhao and Lappalainen, 2012). Note that
an ABCA1 gene was up-regulated in adult Acropora millepora colonies in the light,
i.e. when transport of photosynthate from alga to host occurs (Bertucci et al.,2015).
K02065, which was present in all three Symbiodiniaceae, encodes a
phospholipid/cholesterol/gamma-HCH transport system ATP-binding protein, again
with a potential function in lipid/sterol translocation. Indeed, some ABC family A
transporters (ABCA7 and ABCA3) were upregulated in Cladocopium during
establishment of symbiosis with coral larvae (Mohamed et al., 2019). Thus, although

Fugacium is now considered not to be a coral mutualist, the comparative analyses
presented here do not rule this out. Whilst the nature of the relationship between
Fugacium and corals is still unclear, the apparent contradictions could, however, be
rationalized by consideration of the phylogenetic position of Fugacium. The ability to
become endosymbiotic is considered to be a defining characteristic of the family
Symbiodiniaceae (LaJeunesse et al., 2018); as a member of a derived clade within
the Symbiodiniaceae, Fugacium may have undergone (or be undergoing) secondary
loss of symbiotic potential but its genome still bear vestiges of this ancestral
condition.

The small heat shock protein HSP20 might explain stress tolerance in Chromera
Molecular chaperones are important for refolding damaged proteins (Vierling, 1991),
thus their involvement in stress tolerance is inevitable. Amongst these chaperones
we looked at heat shock proteins in both Chromera and two symbiotic members of
Symbiodiniaceae, Cladocopium and Breviolum. Despite genes coding for
chaperones in the KEGG Orthology 03110 Chaperones and folding catalysts
(including HSP90/70) being present in similar numbers in all of these genera, gene(s)
coding for two HSP20 isoforms were found in both Chromera strains to the exclusion
of the three Symbiodiniaceae algae (Fig. 3). Consistent with a potential role in stress
tolerance the HSP20 was reported recently to be correlated with stress tolerance in
reef-building corals where coral species containing more HSP20 genes were more
stress tolerant (robust corals) than those with smaller numbers of HSP20 genes
(complex corals) (Ying et al., 2018).

Conclusions
This paper describes de novo assembly and annotation of a transcriptome for a
Chromera strain isolated from a GBR coral, which was generated in order to
understand diversity within the species and to provide a better understanding of the
metabolic capabilities and lifestyle of this photosynthetic apicomplexan alga. The
GBR strain has a high degree of similarity with the Sydney (culture collection) strain,
hence infection studies based on the former (e.g. Mohamed et al., 2018) can be
generalized to the latter. Comparisons between Chromera, the Symbiodiniaceae
algae Fugacium, Cladocopium and Breviolum and the apicomplexan parasite P.
falciparum based on specific categories of genes were inconclusive with respect to
common molecular characteristics of mutualists, but suggest that HSP20 genes may
underlie the higher thermal tolerance of Chromera compared to Symbiodiniaceae.
The presence of specific genes implicated in mutualism suggest that Fugacium may
have secondarily lost the ability to establish symbioses, and the comparative
analyses provide a molecular rationale for the near-ubiquitous association of
Cladocopium with Indo-Pacific corals.

Table 1. Illumina sequencing and mapping statistics: number of reads and bases of raw and processed data after quality control
(adapter removal, trimming and filtering low-quality bases) for each library and percentages of reads successfully mapped onto the
GBR Chromera transcriptome. Note that Chromera was subjected to a variety of treatments prior to RNA extraction in order to
ensure that the transcriptome assembly captured as many genes as possible.
