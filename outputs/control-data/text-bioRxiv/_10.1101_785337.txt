Developing biological structures are highly complex systems, within
which shape dynamics at different places is tightly coordinated. One
key process at play during development is the regulation of cell division orientation. In this work, through a reformulation of cell division in terms of its energetic cost, we propose that oriented cell
division is one mechanism by which cells can read and react to mechanical forces propagating in a tissue even in the absence of interphase cellular elongation in the direction of these forces. This view
reproduces standard geometric division long-axis rules as a special
case of a more general behaviour, in which systematic deviations
from these rules can emerge. We show that states of anisotropic tension in multicellular systems can be the cause of these deviations,
as often experimentally found in living tissues. Our results provide
a unifying view on the different intracellular mechanisms at play in
orienting cell division: they are processes which minimize energy
loss, reflecting a trade-off between local and long-range mechanical
signals. The consequences of this competition are explored in simulated tissues and confirmed in vivo during both the development
of the pupal epithelium of dorsal thorax in D. melanogaster and the
epidermal morphogenesis of ascidian embryos.

During animal development, morphogenesis is driven by
dynamical processes occurring at specific positions. These local processes, however, change the global shape of the system,
indicating the presence of mechanisms through which local
shape changes are transmitted to - and interpreted by - cells
located at a distance (1–3). In spite of the many works investigating the dynamics of shape change in living systems (4–12),
and several studies investigating the nature of the information regulating these changes (13, 14), how such information
propagates and is interpreted remains elusive.
Cell division orientation is one important component of
morphogenesis. In animals it contributes for instance in shaping and elongating tissues, maintaining tissue homeostasis,
generating cellular heterogeneity (15–19). Cell division orientation is often correlated to cell shape. In both animals
and plants, the orientation of a cell’s division plane (i.e., the
direction orthogonal to the plane) often aligns with to the
long geometrical axis of the cell at interphase- a rule known
as Hertwig’s rule (HR) in animals (15, 20, 21) and Errera’s
rule in plants (22, 23).
The division plane orientation is provided by the position of
the mitotic spindle (24). In animal cells, spindles are anchored
to the cell cortex through astral microtubules emerging from
the centrosomes and exerting mechanical forces on them. As
a consequence, the spindle equilibrium position due to these
forces has been shown to depend on cell geometry, which provides a physical explanation of long-axis rules for cell division

(25–27). It has further been shown that, in certain species
(21, 28), microtubles anchoring at the cortex is biased by protein accumulation at tricellular junctions. This explains why,
for instance, division orientation in the Drosophila epidermis
is better predicted by the interphase distribution of tricellular
junctions than by the cell shape.
More generally, the action of intra- or extra-cellular mechanical forces on cell division orientation has been extensively
studied (12, 21, 23, 25–31). In these studies, the predicted
division orientation is in very good agreement with the direction of the cell’s long-axis. These results suggest that it
is not cell shape, but rather a proxy that often aligns with
cell shape, to orient cell division. Despite the generality of
such laws, systematic and reproducible deviations from them
are commonly observed experimentally and found to correlate
with states of anisotropic tension in the surrounding tissue
(32–35). These deviating cells often coexist with cells following
HR. To explain at once these two cell populations (respecting HR and deviating from it), the existence of alternative
intracellular mechanisms for spindle positioning has been proposed, which can be biased by anisotropic tension in the tissue
(6, 25, 33, 35).
In spite of these efforts, a unifying understanding of the
regulation of division orientation is still largely missing.
In animals, cell division itself is often accompanied by
radical active changes of shape as the cell proceeds to, through

Significance Statement
In this work we reformulate the process of cell division orientation in development as a mechanical-energy optimization.
We show that classical rules for division orientation naturally
emerge when a cell minimizes the work performed against its
local environment. Moreover, when multicellular stress profiles
are taken into account, observed systematic violations of these
rules are explained in correlation with states of anisotropic tension within the tissue. We confirm our findings experimentally
on developing systems imaged with cellular resolution. Our
results provide a new paradigm to understand cell division in
multicellular contexts and contribute to building a physical view
of biological phenomena.

and out of mitosis (16, 36–39). Mitosis usually does not
affect the cell volume (although exceptions have been reported
(36, 39)), but can lead to an increase in apical surface and in
general alters cell form (38–41). Frequently, an initial increase
in cortical tension results in so-called mitotic rounding, which is
then followed by cell elongation along the direction orthogonal
to the division plane during the stage known as anaphase and,
later, during the completion of cytokinesis. Thanks to the
burst of new imaging technologies (42–45), the dynamics of cell
shape during mitosis and its robustness against environmental
and intrinsic noise can be now investigated in a quantitative
manner.

Fig. 1. 2D representation of cell division in a viscous environment. A cell with 5
neighbours and a given rest shape (vertex positions {xi }) divides, creating two
daughter cells with, respectively, 5 and 4 neighbours and shapes given by vertices
(i)

{y1 } and {y2 }. These two cells deform their surrounding environment to achieve
specific target shapes (for instance, spherical cells), given by target vertex positions

vertex follows a trajectory τ i (n̂) from its initial position y(i) to its target position z(i) .

Inspired by the shape dynamics observed during cell division in
ascidian embryonic epidermis (see Supplementary Information,
Section 3 and Figure S3) and by the results of (36), we assume
here that the portions of space occupied by the mother cell
just before mitosis and by the union of the two daughters
just after mitosis differ. In ascidian embryonic epidermis, for
instance, cell division is accompanied by an increase in the
apical surface of the cellular clone (Fig. S3 of Supplementary
Information).
We will employ here a classical vertex-based representation
of cellular shape (46), according to which the shape of a 2D cell
is abstracted as the positions Ri of its junctions, represented
as vertices of a polygon.

In tightly-packed tissues, dividing animal cells push against
their neighbours to create space to accommodate shape
changes and volume increase during and after mitosis (36, 39).
If a cell’s environment is too stiff for the cell to deform it, the
so-called spindle assembly checkpoint prevents progression to
anaphase and stalls the division process (36). Division is thus a
process in which the cell’s surrounding feeds back information,
used by the cell to control its mitosis. This implies that the
dividing cell spends a certain amount of energy in changing its
shape against the mechanical resistance of surrounding tissues.
If the environment is too stiff to be deformed, cell mitosis is
not completed (36), showing that a dividing cell is able to
read, and react to, the mechanical state of its environment.
In (32), a mechanical model for the influence of direct neighbours on cell division orientation was given: neighbours can
change a cell’s long axis due to mechanical forces depending
on their topology. However, this model only accounted for the
mechanical influence of a cell’s long-axis, assuming HR as the
standard division rule. Also, no connection to multicellular
mechanical stress patterns was considered. Yet, in light of the
results of (36), we argue that a strong connection between the
progression and regulation of mitotic process and the amount
of a cell’s internal energy flowing to its environment through
mechanical forces must exist. However, no physical model has
been developed yet to study this phenomenon: filling this gap
is the main contribution of our work.

In this work, we developed a theoretical model of the energetic cost of cell division and its effect on cell division orientation. We employ a many-body physics point of view: we
argue that, not differently from other physical phenomena, cell
division minimizes (mechanical) energy dissipation due to a
cell’s interaction with its local and remote environments. This
interaction provides the cell with information on the mechanical state of its surroundings. Such information is mechanically
supplied to (and integrated by) a dividing cell and used as a
cue to orient its division plane, which contributes to ensuring
a global long-range coherence to evolving biological forms.
Through this energetic view, we can explain at once HR and
deviations from it as limiting cases of a general behaviour. We
show that the competing intracellular mechanisms for division
orientation suggested to explain deviations from HR, can be
given a unifying view as optimal responses to minimize energy
loss of the dividing cell. Hence, both the intracellular mechanisms responsible for HR and those biased by tissue tension
allow for cellular energy optimisation.

A. The role of local cellular environment. Biological tissues are
usually modelled as non-equilibrium viscoelastic mechanical
systems (47), with properties changing with time and observation scale. In many circumstances one can, however, model
the resistance offered by biological matter to displacement as
a fluid with viscosity η. This simplification allows to explicitly model the energetic cost of shape changes. Such changes
happen against the viscosity of the surroundings, and as such
must entail an energetic price payed by the internal energy
of the cell. Interestingly, this view implies that the direction
and amount of deformation needed depends on the orientation
of the division plane with respect to the distribution of cell
vertices.
Consider a dividing cell, described by its initial collection
of vertices {xi } as represented in Fig. 1. Once mitotic spindles
are positioned and the division plane is fixed, the cell is virtually composed of its two future daughters 1, 2 with vertices,
(i)
(i)
respectively, {y1 } and {y2 }. During and after division, cells
change their shape by moving their vertices from initial posi(i)
(i)
tions {y1,2 } to final positions {z1,2 }, determined by the target
shape of the daughter cells (see Fig. 1). Energy is consumed

jectory, v1(2) (t) its finite velocity,
(
) runs over all κ1
(κ2 ) vertices of daughter cell 1 (2) (common vertices contribute
with weight 1/2 in both sums). Here and in what follows, a
cell division orientation is defined as the direction orthogonal
to the cell division plane (i.e., the direction orthogonal to the
segment x6 − x7 in Fig. 1). The work in Eq. (1) depends
on the amount of deformation required to accommodate the
daughters’ final shapes. A natural consequence of this is that
different division orientations correspond to different amounts
of energy consumed by the dividing cell ∆U c (n̂) = −Wη . This
formulation of the energetic cost of cell division (and its generalization, see Eq. (3) in the following) is the first contribution
of this work.

B. Long-range mechanical contribution to the energetics of
cell division. Cells or tissues also actively change their shape,

as a result of intra-cellular processes and/or the effect of external interactions (1, 2, 30, 47–50). Like any movement of
matter, an active local change in shape implies the buildup of mechanical forces within the tissue, whose distance of
propagation depends on the properties of the cellular medium
(47). These forces create mechanical stress within the tissue,
whose magnitude decreases with the distance from the center
of the active process. We formalize these ideas considering
a generic morphodynamic process σ at position rσ (for instance, a cell actively changing its shape) which exerts a force
Fσ (r, rσ ) = ψσ (r, rσ )ŵσ (r, rσ ) at any position r in the tissue, of intensity ψσ(r, rσ ) and direction ŵσ (r, rσ ). Writing
ψσ = Fσ h d(r, rσ ) , where Fσ is the force intensity at the
position of the process σ, h(x) is a monotonically decreasing
function with h(0) = 1 (accounting for the decrease of stress
magnitude with distance), d(r, rσ ) is the euclidean distance be
tween r and the process σ and fσ (r, rσ ) = ŵσ (r, rσ )h d(r, rσ ) ,
the total force at a position r exerted by all active morphodynamic processes at play within the tissue is

In what follows, to simplify notation, we will often keep the
dependence of Fσ on rσ implicit and simply write Fσ =Fσ (r).
The effect of the total force in Eq. (2) is also “felt" by dividing
cells as it alters the mechanical state of their environment.
Along its trajectory from y(i) to z(i) during cell division, a
vertex at instantaneous position p(i) (t) will feel the force
F(p(i) (t)) acting on it, on top of the viscosity η of the local
environment. This force exerts mechanical work on the vertex
and alters the energetic cost of the dividing cell: the more
intense the force F(p(i) (t)), the easier for the vertex to move
along its direction. As a result, the long-range forces of Eq. (2)
supply a part of the energy needed for shape changes during

A. Isolated tissues. Eq. (3) has several interesting consequences. For isolated tissues in the absence of mechanical
cues (φσ = 0), cell geometry is expected to guide the orientation of cell division. The local part of Eq. (3), i.e., Eq. (1), is
able to account for and physically explain this fact, as shown in
Fig. 2 for 104 cells, whose shape and vertices distribution were
randomly simulated as explained in the Supplementary Information. For each of them, Eq. (1) was numerically minimized
assuming linear trajectories τki . As shown in Fig. 2, the energetically optimal direction n̂0 minimizing Eq. (1) correlates with
both the main elongation axis n̂HR and the principal direction
of the distribution of tricellular junctions (in our model, cell
vertices) n̂CJ . Interestingly, the agreement of Eq. (1) to n̂CJ
is higher than to n̂HR , supporting tricellular junctions as the
main geometrical cue for division orientation in 2D structures,
as shown in (21). This shows how the direction determined
by cell elongation is often also the one along which shape
changes can happen at the lowest energetic cost in viscous
environments. Cells following HR (or the tricellular-junction
rule) are the ones minimizing their energy loss.

∆U c stems from the multiscale competition between the local,
passive contribution of Eq. (1) and the active, long-range effect
of Eq. (2), and is a function of the cell’s division orientation
through the trajectories τ i (n̂). This competition between the
viscosity η of the local environment and the force Fσ generated by active morphological changes is captured by the ratio
φσ = Fησ . When φσ  1 the force exerted by the process σ
dominates, at positions r such that φσ h(d(r, rσ )) > 1, over
the local resistance of the environment to deformation; on
the other hand, when φσ  1, the force Fσ is negligible and
viscosity dominates. This competition, captured by Eq. (3), is
the cornerstone of our work and provides an energetic standpoint to understand energy fluxes between a dividing cell and
its local and distant environments. It provides a quantitative
ground to study oriented cell division by allowing the identification of the most energetically-favourable set of trajectories
for cell division, given by the direction n̂0 maximising Eq. (3).
It is worth stressing here that the effect of mechanical forces
in Eq. (3) is fully independent of the possible interphase strain
they induce on the cell: in Eq. (3) the consequences of stress
anisotropy are independent on whether the cell elongates during interphase in the direction of stress. This is indeed what
was observed in several in vivo situations (34, 35): mechanical
stress in a tissue correlates with division orientations even in
the absence of cellular interphase elongation in the direction
of stress, leading to systematic violations of geometric rules
for cell division.

. Specifically, χHR = arccos |n̂0 · n̂HR |, χCJ = arccos |n̂0 · n̂CJ |.
Results are obtained for 104 randomly simulated cells. Here
n̂0 minimizes Eq. (1); n̂HR is the cell’s main elongation axis
and n̂CJ the main direction of its tricellular junctions. Red
points (right vertical scale) give the average eccentricity of the
ellipses approximating each cell in each histogram bar. 90% of
cells have χCJ < 22° and χHR < 30°, in agreement with what
is found in vivo (21).

Fig. 3. Reconstruction and polygonal approximation of the Drosophila pupal dorsal
thorax epithelium. Data from (7).

The blue histograms in Fig. 4(a,b) show the distribution
of angles between the actual division orientation and the celljunction geometric rule. One finds a marked peak at low
angles, with a low long-tail distribution at high angles, in
accordance to what previously reported (21). As expected,
the best agreement of the model to observed orientations was
obtained with Eq. (1), i.e., with no contribution of external
forces or φσ = 0. Figure 4(a) shows the deviation angle
distributions between the actual division orientation and the
predictions of Eq. (1) (red), compared with the deviations
from the main direction of cell-junction distribution (blue).
Figure 4(b) shows the same comparison Eq. (3) and φσ = 10
(yellow). The model predicts no stress anisotropy to be present
in the developing tissue. Both CJ rule and the model with
φσ = 0 work well in explaining the observed distribution of
division directions, with average deviation angles of ∼ 29◦
for Eq. (1) and ∼ 30◦ for CJ distribution. As expected from
the results of subection A, our model agrees with geometric
rules (and in particular with cell-junction distribution) in
absence of stress anisotropy. In addition, Eq. (1) predicts
a higher fraction of orientations within 3◦ from the actual
direction, and has fewer high-angle deviations (> 80◦ ) than
the distribution of CJ. The result shows well that the model
is able to infer the mechanical stress state of the tissue and
to reproduce, and at the same time provide physical bases
to, the correlation between tricellular junction positions and
regulation of division orientation in epithelia, showing that
cells follow the most energetically-favourable path during shape
changes in mitosis.

B. 2D tissue development: Drosophila dorsal thorax pupal
epithelium. To further test the predictions of Eq. (1), we stud-

ied division orientation distribution during the development
of the pupal epithelium of dorsal thorax of D. melanogaster.
Using the dataset from (7), we reconstructed and tracked cells
from the central patch of the developing tissue, during 14h of
development. From this reconstruction, using the DRACOSTEM library (51), we further built a polygonal approximation
of each cell which respects the original topology, as shown
in Fig. 3, from which cell-junction (vertex) positions were
extracted. As shown in (7), cell patches in the central zone of
the pupal dorsal thorax develop with an isotropic, square-like
geometry. This suggests that mechanical stress, if present, is
highly isotropic in that zone. In turn, this means that the
total external force Eq. (2) acting at all positions in the reconstructed zone of the tissue is negligible and Eq. (1) should
alone be able to recapitulate the observed division orientations.
The observed dynamics of shape change during and after
cell division is highly variable. Both the daughter cell shape
and the surface change after division do not show conserved
patterns. We have nevertheless assumed that the “desired" target shape of daughter cells is regular, and that deviations from
this assumptions are due to strong mechanical interactions
with neighbouring cells. To account for cell-to-cell variability,
we optimized for each cell division the target surface area
S
ratio Sdaughters
in a small range between 0.8 and 1.1: this
mother
range is what we most frequently observe in the dataset for
S
the dynamics of the ratio Sdaughters
over few timepoints after
mother
division.
Excluding cells at the border of the reconstructed patch,
to avoid reconstruction artefacts, left us with 3664 cell divisions. For each of them, we compared the division orientation with the main direction of the interphase distribution of
cell-junctions, obtained by studying the vertex positions at
two-third of each cell’s cell cycle duration. This geometry was
also used to run the model of Eq. (1). For comparison, we also
run the model with non-negligible external forces in Eq. (3),

This illustrates that cells following geometric rules have an
energetic advantage.

In many

illustrates the process of gastrulation in embryos of the ascidian P. mammillata, a model organism to study animal
morphogenesis (53). Around 4 hours after fertilization, these
embryos undergo major shape change processes, collectively
known as gastrulation, which begin with the invagination of a
group of cells (54), whose active shape changes drive the whole
process as schematically depicted in Fig. 5(a) for control (Ctrl)
conditions (see also Fig. S1 of the Supplementary Information).
Part of the epidermis of these embryos is at one- to few-cell
distance from the gastrulating core and is hence strongly subjected to the induced mechanical stress. Interestingly, during
these processes no cell migration nor cell death is known to
happen.
To evaluate the role of mechanical stress in epidermal morphogenesis, we also partly blocked gastrulation by FGF/ERK
signalling inhibition (U0126 inhibitor). Affecting the balance between FGF and Eph signaling was previously shown
to impair gastrulation (55) by a fate switch of A-line endoderm precursors to trunk lateral cells (56). Embryo treated
with U0126 would undergo the first of the two sequential processes of gastrulation (apical shrinking) but would not proceed
through the second one (baso-lateral shortening), as depicted
in Fig. 5(a) for U0126 treatment and as shown in Fig. S1 of the
Supplementary Information. This arguably produces a weaker
stress profile propagating to epidermal precursors, since the
contribution to mechanical forces of baso-lateral shortening
is missing. The morphogenesis of embryonic ascidian epidermis is a quasi-2D process, in spite of the global 3D curved
structure of the developing embryo (Section 3 and Fig. S2 of
Supplementary Information).
To study the consequences of the competition between
local viscosity and long-range propagation or transmission of
mechanical forces in this system, we analysed the theoretical
situation depicted in Fig. 5(b) in which one shrinking structure
(in blue) (representing for instance a group of cells) exerts
a force F0 f0 on a simulated system initially composed of n
cells, with characteristic linear dimension L0 , undergoing three
rounds of cell divisions.

Fig. 5. Gastrulation in embryos of P. mammillata in both Control and U0126 treatment
conditions

(panel (a), adapted from (54)). Panel (b): system of 20
cells, of characteristic linear dimension L0 , in contact with a
shrinking structure (panel (a)), with exponentially-decaying
stress profile of length scale ζL0 . This serves as a model to
study the morphogenesis of the epidermis of embryos of P.
mammillata during gastrulation. Thanks to the invariant lineage of ascidian embryos, homologous cells can be identified
in different embryos. Panels (c) (for Control) and (d) (for
U0126 treatment) show the average angular deviation ∆HR
(in degree) from HR for three rounds of divisions in ascidian epidermis. The average for each cell is taken over all
divisions and across two embryonic datasets for Control conditions (taken from (19)) or one dataset for U0126 treatment
and visualised through the morphological browser MorphoNet
(45). To facilitate comparison and exploiting the invariant
lineage of ascidian embryos, the deviations in panels (c)-(d)
are projected onto the same wild-type embryo reconstruction.

Thanks to the transparency of P. mammillata embryos and
to state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction of live embryonic development, high-quality 3D dynamic data on their development
is now available (19). Remarkably, ascidian embryos develop
with a fixed lineage, which allows to identify homologous cells
across several different embryos. We have hence calculated, as
detailed in the Supplementary Information, the angular deviation ∆HR of division orientation from HR for each epidermal

across all divisions within each clone (i.e., the set of progeny

shown in Fig. 5(c), projected onto the 22 cells at the 64-cell
stage which will give rise to epidermis. A pattern of deviations

emerges, for cells mostly localised around the tissue border.
We performed the same analysis on the U0126-treated
embryo. The average value per clone is reported in Fig. 5(d),
represented on the same embryo used in Fig. 5(c) to facilitate
comparison. The deviations observed in Ctrl conditions at the
interface between epidermis and mesendodermal tissues are
far less present in the U0126 treated embryo: affecting the
stress profile induced by gastrulation seems to have an impact
on the division orientation of epidermal cells.
These observations make the epidermal morphogenesis of
P. mammillata an ideal system to test our theory.

We hence set out
to study the toy model of Fig. 5(b) with different magnitudes of
external mechanical forces, in order to understand whether the
division orientation and the global shapes thus produced can
explain the phenomenology of ascidian epidermis. Orientation
of each cell division is determined according to our model,
hence minimizing Eq. (3). After division, due to the concurrent
changes in cell shape, the total tissue is out of mechanical
equilibrium. This produces, during interphase, a dynamics of
relaxation towards the tissue rest shape, which comes from
the competition between interacting cells trying to minimize
their configurational energy. Under normal conditions, this
energy for an isolated cell is minimized for spherical shape due
to the cell’s cortical tension (57). The dynamics of a 2D tissue
has largely been studied and is well captured by the many-cell
energy function (46)

surface Ac . The latter accounts at once for volume compressibility and for the actomyosin-mediated elastic properties of a
cell surface. The final rest shape is achieved as the minimum
of the multicellular energy in Eq. (4).
Viscous forces during cell division depend on the speed at
which each vertex trajectory is travelled. To keep things as simple as possible, we assume here a constant vertex displacement
speed ν. Recalling the definition of the parameters φσ = Fησ
in Eq. (3), one can introduce the dimensionless version of φσ
as the order parameter ρ = φνσ , measuring the relative intensity of external to viscous forces: ρ  1 means dominating
contribution of external forces. Note that ρ can also be seen
as a measure of the amount of anisotropy of mechanical stress
compared to the viscosity of the medium. This is because an
isotropic mechanical stress would imply that each direction of
vertex movement is equally affected by long-range forces and
hence no bias in the choice of optimal division direction would
be produced. At the same time, one expects that the effect
of localized morphogenetic processes is not perceived with
the same intensity everywhere in a tissue. This means that
the stress profile induced by each of these processes decays
with the distance from the position of the process itself, as
described by the function h d(r, rσ ) in Eq. (2). Stress decay
is assumed here to be an exponential function e−d(r,rσ )/Lδ (t) ,
with a time-dependent length-scale Lδ (t) = δ(t)Ld (δ(t) = 1
for the first two divisions and δ(t) = 2 for the last). This
time-dependence account both for the increasing density of
cell junctions with cell divisions, known to help propagating

tissue-scale stress profiles (58). The fractional stress decay
lengthscale is ζ = Ld /L0 . Between divisions, the system
evolves towards its interphase equilibrium according to the
Hamiltonian in Eq. (4), with parameters initially fixed at
3/2
λc /(κc Scell ) = 5 × 10−5 (Scell being the surface of each of the
20 initial cells), to account for cell volume incompressibility.
We will however show that the results of the model are highly
robust against noise in this ratio.
We characterize the dynamics of cell divisions by two main
quantities: how much each cell deviates from the predictions
of pure cell geometrical rules, and how aligned consecutive
divisions within the same clone are. The latter quantity gives
information on whether cells tend to orient their division
plane along a fixed axis, independently on their shape. This
quantity is also correlated to deviations from geometrical rules:
it is known that the agreement to geometrical rules often
gives rise to alternating orthogonal directions for division
orientations within one clone (27). We measure here the
cellular elongation as the main direction of the distribution of
its vertices, since cell shape itself is defined by its vertices in
the vertex-based model we employ. At the same time, this is
biologically relevant as it corresponds to the main direction
of tricellular junction distribution, as already commented in
previous Sections. The first quantity is measured by the
parameter α = 1 − hχCJ i/90, with hχCJ i = harccos |n̂0 · n̂CJ |i
being the average angle between the direction of division and
the main direction of distribution of tricellular junctions. The
average is taken over every cell at each round of division. α is
1 for perfectly aligned and 0 for fully orthogonal predictions.
To define a measure for the second quantity (the alignment
of consecutive divisions within a clone) consider, for a set of
(0)
initial cells Sc , the parameter

measuring the correlation between the orientations n of any
two consecutive divisions at t and t + 1 within the same clone
(0)
of any cell c ∈ Sc . The average is taken over all cells and all
pairs of consecutive division rounds.
We use these two parameters to study the influence of external forces on the initial set of 20 cells of Fig. 5(b). Based
on what we observe in ascidian epidermis (see Section 3 of
Supplementary Information and results in (19)), we assume
that a dividing cell increases its surface area by a factor 21/3
(representative of what measured during embryonic development, as shown in the Supplementary Information) and that
daughter cells, after divisions, tend to acquire regular shapes.
The left plot of Fig. 6(a) shows α as a function of ρ (ratio of
intensity of active to viscous forces) and ζ (penetration length
of mechanical stress in the tissue). Two phases appear in the
response of the system: as expected at low ρ (dominant viscosity), Eq. (3) correlates very well with individual-cell geometry
and α reaches high values; increasing ρ, however, the system
undergoes a behavioral phase transition of the continuous type
at a critical value ρc of the order parameter. As shown in
Fig. 6(a), this critical value is only weakly dependent on ζ,
provided ζ itself is above a critical value ζc . At high ρ a new
phase emerges in which the agreement between Eq. (3) and
geometrical rules is rapidly lost (α sharply decreases). To
understand the cause of this phase transition we looked at the
correlations between cells within the simulated tissue.

Figure 6(a) (right) and 6(b) show that the transition to
the new phase in the tissue is correlated to the appearance
of time-correlations within each clone, as measured by the
parameter γ [Eq. (5)]. These time-correlations are in turn
induced by the stress dynamics within the tissue.
To test the influence of mechanical relaxation parameters
of Eq. (4), simulations at fixed ζ = 1/6 were run with random
3/2
values for λc /(κc Scell ), drawn out of a Gaussian distribution
centered around 5 × 10−5 and of standard deviation 10−5 .
Figure 6(b) shows, for each simulated value of ρ, the average
and the standard deviation (in black vertical bars) for 20
3/2
random values of λc /(κc Scell ).
The onset of time correlations γ past the critical value
ρc suggests that the shape of clones may be strongly altered
in the presence of external forces, even without single-cell
elongation in the direction of these forces, simply due to
time correlations between division orientations and shape
changes during cytokinesis. This is indeed the case, as shown
in Fig. 6(c): past the critical value ρc , clones start showing a
more elongated form, tending to a linear shape at high ρ values.
This in turn affects the global tissue shape, which tends to
follow the change in shape of the external shrinking structure.
The two phases can coexist in the same tissue, as shown in
the rightmost example of 6(c), in which the cells facing away
from the external force are in the viscosity-dominated phase
and follow geometrical rules (α = 0.9, γ = 0.2), while the ones
directly facing the force are in a stress-dominated phase with
high temporal correlations and high deviations from geometry
(α = 0.4, γ = 0.8).

Thanks to the availability of several 3D reconstructions of
live embryonic development (19), we analysed division orientations and apical geometry of epidermal cells in two embryos
of P. mammillata (see also Figure S1 in the Supplementary
Information): the coexistence of these two phases is observed
in vivo, and elongated epidermal clones are built up while following the active shape changes of gastrulation as exemplified
in Fig. 6(d) for the two Control embryos ASTEC-Pm1 and
ASTEC-Pm2. The cellular distribution in each clone observed
in this process is the same as the one predicted by Eq. (3). In
addition, the overall tissue shape shows the same structure
as the high-stress tissues of Fig. 6(e), with a similar phase
transition marked by a change in α from 0.7±0.01 to 0.6±0.03
and in γ from 0.3 ± 0.03 to 0.51 ± 0.04.
On the other hand, such transition is much weaker in the
U0126-treated embryo ASTEC-U0126-Pm1, in which gastrulation is largely blocked (rightmost embryo in Fig. 6(d)): the
value of γ is constant everywhere in the analysed epidermis
and the clones shape is everywhere similar to what expected at
low ρ (weak external forces). The overall shape of the tissue,
in spite of some noise due to the marked change in global
embryonic geometry (Fig. S1 of Supplementary Information),
closely resembles what predicted by our model before the behavioural transition (leftmost simulation in Fig. 6(c)), where
clones have rectangular shapes and γ = 0.2 everywhere: this
is exactly what we observed in the U0126-treated embryo.

534

In this work, we propose a mechanism by which developing
biological structures maintain a global shape consistency in

Gastrulation

No Gastrulation

Fig. 6. Panels (a) and (b) show the predictions of Eq. (3) for the simulated system
of Fig. 5(b). A marked transition is found between two phases, (panel (a)), for both
the agreement of Eq. (3) to geometrical rules α and the average time-correlation
of division orientations in clones γ , as a function of the order parameters ρ and
ζ . The first phase, (viscosity-dominated, low ρ) shows a high agreement α to the
geometrical rules for cell division and a low time-correlation parameter γ . The second
phase (stress-dominated, high ρ) shows poor agreement to geometrical rules and
high temporal correlations. The transition between the two is continuous, as seen in
panel (b), showing the transition at fixed stress fractional penetration length ζ = 1/6
(γ in red triangles, right vertical scale; α in blue dots, left vertical scale). Black
vertical bars give the standard deviations for 20 randomly simulated values of the
ratio λc /(κc L3
0 ). Panel (c) shows the consequences of this transition on the global
tissue shape: above the critical value ρc , the shape of the whole tissue start being
affected by the externally-induced mechanical stimuli. This is a consequence of the
time correlations of division orientations, building up in the tissue due to long-range
mechanical cues. The dynamics of stress propagation can be clearly read in the shape
of the clones (collection of all progeny) of each of the 20 initial cells. These predictions
were tested in the development of the epidermis of embryos of P. mammillata (panel
(d)), in both control condition (ASTEC-Pm1, ASTEC-Pm2) and U0126 treatment

. Due to the force produced by shape changes of invaginating cells during gastrulation, Ctrl embryos show the same
transition in clones shape and cellular distribution as the
one predicted by the model at intensities ρ slight past the
critical value. The U0126-treated epidermis shows no such
transition, in agreement with the prediction of the model at
low ρ values due to the absence of baso-lateral shortening.

spite of major local changes in their form. Through a reformulation of the process of cytokinesis in terms of its energetic
cost, we show that cells can read shape dynamics of their local
and remote environments, and react by orienting their division

in a way that minimizes the work spent against the passive
resistance of their surrounding. The cell main geometrical axis
emerges as the direction along which the work performed by
a cell during division and against the passive resistance of its
local environment is minimal. When applying our theory to
the development of the pupal epithelium of dorsal thorax of
D. melanogaster, we were able to infer the absence of stress
anisotropy in the tissue and to recapitulate the known rule
for division orientation based on interphase distribution of
tricellular junctions (21).
However active processes of shape dynamics can bias such
energetic cost and provide multiscale cues to guide cell division, in agreement with what is observed, for instance, in the
Arabidopsis meristem (33). In these cases, reproducible and
systematic deviations from long-axis rules emerge, as repeatedly experimentally reported (33–35). We provide a theoretical
framework to explain and understand these deviations: the
competition between local and long-range stimuli gives rise
to a transition between two distinct phases of a multicellular
system, marked by the onset of time-correlations within cellular clones. Remarkably the co-existence of these two phases,
predicted by our model, is found in vivo in the epidermis of
the developing embryo of the ascidian P. mammillata. Our
model is further able to account for the phenotype of ascidian
embryos after FGF/ERK signalling inhibition, which partially
inhibits endoderm invagination and as a consequence changes
the orientation of cell divisions in epidermis.
Our model can thus explain both the known geometrical
rules for cell division and the systematic deviations from them
observed in certain developmental contexts. We note however
that, due to the lack of shape changes during plant cell division, the extension of this framework to vegetal cells is yet an
open question and deserves further analysis. Both geometrical rules and deviations emerge as particular cases of a more
general rule, which is the consequences of an energy exchange
between a dividing cell and its environment. This exchange
provides a way by which cells can sense and react to external
mechanical forces, fully independent of the presence of interphase cell elongation in the direction of these forces. In this
way, tissue deformation and shape dynamics can be produced
without the need of individual cell deformations. Our result
sheds new light on the physics of morphogenesis and on the
mutual interplay between morphodynamics and mitosis, and
suggest that oriented cell division is one of the contributing
mechanisms allowing long-range transfer of information in
biological structures. Such information transfer, under the
form of internal mechanical stress, can be read in the shape of
cellular clones within a proliferating tissue, providing a new
paradigm to infer and follow force dynamics in living systems.
