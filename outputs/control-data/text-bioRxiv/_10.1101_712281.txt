Abstract

22

By the end of the 2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak, it is estimated that there were up to

23

100 million infections in the Americas. In approximately one in seven infants born to

24

mothers infected during pregnancy, ZIKV has been linked to microcephaly,

25

developmental delays, or other congenital disorders collectively known as congenital

26

Zika syndrome (CZS). Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in ZIKV infected adults. It is a

27

global health priority to develop a vaccine against ZIKV that elicits long-lasting

28

immunity, however, the durability of immunity to ZIKV is unknown. Previous studies in

29

mice and nonhuman primates have been crucial in vaccine development but have not

30

defined the duration of immunity generated by ZIKV infection. In this study, we

31

rechallenged five rhesus macaques with ZIKV two years after a primary ZIKV infection.

32

We show that primary ZIKV infection generates high titers of neutralizing antibodies

33

(nAbs) that protect from detectable plasma viremia following rechallenge and persist for

34

at least 27 months. While additional longitudinal studies are necessary with longer time

35

frames, this study establishes a new experimentally defined minimal length of protective

36

ZIKV immunity.

that they may become the center of next ZIKV outbreak. While pre-existing herd

44

immunity in regions of past outbreaks may dampen the potential for future outbreaks to

45

occur, we currently do not know the longevity of protective immunity to ZIKV after a

46

person becomes infected. Here, we establish a new experimentally defined minimal

47

length of protective ZIKV immunity. We show that five rhesus macaques initially infected

48

with ZIKV two years prior to rechallenge elicit a durable immune response that

49

protected from detectable plasma viremia. While this work establishes a new minimal

50

length of protective immunity, additional studies are necessary to define the maximum

51

length of protective immunity following ZIKV infection.

Introduction

54

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus first isolated in 1947 in the Zika forest of

55

Uganda [1]. ZIKV is contracted through a mosquito bite or sexual contact and can be

56

passed from mother to fetus during pregnancy [2]. ZIKV infections are typically mild:

57

characterized by low-grade fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis [3].

58

The recent outbreak of ZIKV in the Americas was associated with more severe disease.

59

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has found in a small proportion of ZIKV-positive adults

60

in the French Polynesian and American outbreaks [4, 5]. In addition, infants born to

61

mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy have an approximately one in seven

62

chance of having congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), a collection of fetal abnormalities

63

and developmental disorders [6, 7]. A retrospective analysis of infants, now aged 7 - 32

64

months, born to mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy, has shown that one-third

65

of those infants have below average neurodevelopment [8]. Currently, it is unknown if

66

ZIKV infection in humans confers lifelong immunity, however it is suggested that waning

67

immunity over time leads to more severe ZIKV in the future [9, 10]. It is thought that a

68

single infection or vaccination that generates neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers above

69

1:10 PRNT50 (50% plaque reduction neutralization test) is enough to confer lifelong

70

immunity in other flaviviruses, such as yellow fever virus (YFV) or dengue virus (DENV)

71

[11, 12]. Antibodies to YFV and DENV have been detected at least 60 years and 35

72

years after infection, respectively [13–15]. Despite long-term immunity to YFV and

73

DENV, challenges remain in eradication of these viruses due to evidence of circulation

74

in sylvatic (forest) cycles in Asia and Africa, and urban human-mosquito cycles in South

75

America [16–19]. ZIKV circulates as one serotype while DENV circulates as four

76

antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV-1 through DENV-4) [20, 21]. No single serotype

77

of DENV has been eradicated after an outbreak even though there is long-term

78

population-level immunity [15]. Similarly, there is a highly effective YFV vaccine that

79

induces lifelong immunity but hasn’t led to the eradication of YFV [14]. Little is known

80

about ZIKV transmission cycles in the Americas, but looking at past flavivirus outbreaks,

81

herd immunity and vector control alone will likely not be enough to eradicate the virus.

82

Determining the longevity of immunity elicited from previous natural ZIKV infection will

83

be important for assessing the risk of reinfection in future outbreaks, as well as for

84

estimating the number of people who are at-risk of future ZIKV infections.

85

The current understanding of ZIKV immunity in humans is derived primarily from

86

vaccine clinical trials that are in progress [22]. Recipients of a prM+E consensus DNA

87

vaccine (GLS-5700) developed nAb titers ranging from 1:18 to 1:317 fourteen weeks

88

after the first vaccination. Adoptive transfer of this week fourteen serum provided

89

protection in 92% of mice challenged with a Puerto Rican isolate of ZIKV [23]. Similar

90

work with three purified inactivated virus (PIV) vaccines found that 92% of recipients

91

generated nAb titers greater than 1:100 which corresponds to protection from viremia in

92

mice that were challenged after adoptive antibody transfer of day 57 purified IgG [24].

93

ZIKV vaccine studies have shown that a range of nAb titers can protect from viremia.

94

However, these studies did not look past 14 weeks to examine the duration of protection

95

of vaccine-derived nAbs.

96

Several animal models, including mice and rhesus macaques, have been used to

97

explore vaccine protection against experimental ZIKV exposure [25].

98

Immunocompromised mouse models have been used to advance the knowledge of

99

ZIKV due to their cost effectiveness and availability. Published ZIKV challenge intervals

100

in mice have varied from 3 to 30 weeks after vaccine administration and shown that nAb

101

titers of EC50 (half maximal effective concentration) ranging from 1:75 to 1:100,000

102

were protective from viremia after ZIKV challenge [26–32]. While immunodeficient

103

mouse models are readily accessible, ZIKV infection is typically lethal because these

104

mice lack necessary components of the antiviral response. Immunodeficient mice

105

provide information on efficacy and safety of therapeutic interventions but fail to provide

106

information on natural virus pathogenicity [25, 33]. Non-human primates (NHP) have

107

also been used in ZIKV studies because they more closely mimic human ZIKV

108

infections [25]. For this reason, NHP studies have been used to assess the durability of

109

immunity from 4 weeks to 1 year following vaccine administration [31, 32, 34, 35].

110

Looking at the longest duration between vaccination and challenge, Abbink et al. [32]

conducted a study using rhesus macaques to demonstrate the protective efficacy of a

112

ZIKV purified inactivated virus (PIV), DNA-M-Env, and RhAd52-M-Env vaccine

113

candidates. At 52 weeks after administration, they challenged the macaques with Zika

114

Virus/H.sapiens-tc/BRA/2015/Brazil-ZKV2015 (ZIKV-BR). The PIV and RhAd52-M-Env

115

vaccines generated log10 MN50 (50% reduction of microneutralization, comparable to

116

EC50 and PRNT50 values [36]) titers of 1.88 and 2.38 by week 4, but by week 8 after

117

boost immunization log10 MN50 titers increased to and fluctuated between 3.71 and

118

2.42 through week 52, respectively. The DNA-M-Env vaccine generated log10 MN50

119

titers of 2.23 at week 8 after boost immunization and rapidly decline to 1.43 by week 14

120

but remained stable until week 52. These titers of neutralizing antibodies showed that

121

the PIV, RhAd52-M-Env, and DNA-M-Env vaccines protected 75% (6 of 8), 100% (4 of

122

4), and 29% (2 of 7), respectively, of macaques after ZIKV-BR challenge [32].

123

Relying on vaccine studies is not sufficient to determine the durability of immunity

124

because vaccine studies rely on booster vaccinations to increase the level of immunity

125

[37]. Natural infections elicit a higher level of immunity that plateaus above the

126

protective threshold thereby maintaining longer protection [38]. For this reason,

127

rechallenge experiments are useful to understand the durability of immunity elicited by

128

natural infection.

129

Rechallenge experiments using animal models have been used to examine immune

130

responses following natural ZIKV infection, and to confirm that these infections protect

131

from subsequent exposures [25]. Mouse models have been used to rechallenge 3

132

weeks after primary infection [39–41]. In rhesus macaques, challenge periods have

133

varied from 6 weeks to 10 weeks after primary challenge [42–45]. We previously

134

demonstrated that rhesus macaques were protected from homologous or heterologous

135

rechallenge up to 10 weeks after primary infection [44, 45]. These studies have shown

136

that following ZIKV rechallenge, CD8 T cell and CD4 T cell responses are weak, but

137

there is an increase in natural killer (NK) cells and nAbs, which correspond to protection

138

from disease but not sterilizing immunity [41, 42, 45]. While this is useful for establishing

139

the potency of naturally elicited immunity, rapid rechallenge does not mimic the situation

140

where someone infected in the 2015/2016 American outbreak is re-exposed years later

141

in a subsequent outbreak.

142

Here we demonstrate a new minimum length of protection resulting from primary ZIKV

143

infection using Indian-origin rhesus macaques from previously published studies [44,

144

46, 47].

Immune parameters do not change significantly following ZIKV rechallenge

168

In order to characterize the immune responses following a long-term ZIKV rechallenge,

169

we assessed immune activation by measuring Ki-67 expression, as a marker of

170

activation, in natural killer (NK) cells, CD4, CD8, and CD8 effector memory (TEM) T cells

171

by flow cytometry (S1 Fig). The percentage of activated cells per microliter of blood are

172

presented as fold-change from the number of activated cells found 3 days before

173

rechallenge (baseline) to determine fold-change in activation from baseline (S1 Fig).

174

Repeated measures ANOVA showed that there were no significant changes in the

175

number of activated CD4, CD8, and CD8 TEM T cell populations over time. In contrast,

176

there was significant variation from baseline measurements in activated (Ki67+) NK cell

177

populations (F(2.263, 9.051) = 10.36, p = 0.0039), but further analysis by Dunnett’s

178

multiple comparisons test showed no significant change in NK cell populations when

179

comparing number of activated NK cells each day after rechallenge to the number 3

180

days before rechallenge.

181

Serum nAb responses were measured using a flow cytometry-based ZIKV

182

neutralization assay. Prior to rechallenge, all animals had high EC50 (50% effective

183

concentration) values (Fig 2A), that were greater than the 1:10 PRNT50 values

recommended for other flavivirus vaccines [11, 12]. Using a one-way paired t-test, we

185

compared EC50 values on day 0 to EC50 values on day 14 and day 28 (Fig 2B). All

186

animals showed increased nAb titers following rechallenge as noted by a greater EC50

187

value on day 14 compared to day 0 (p = 0.0025, t=5.604, df=4) and on day 28 (p =

188

0.0015, t=6.446, df=4). The increase in nAbs shows that initial infection may fail to

189

provide sterilizing immunity. Alternatively, it is possible that the antigen present in the

190

virus preparation was sufficient to boost pre-existing antibody responses. However, the

191

combination of immunophenotyping data, neutralization assay data, and persistent

192

negative plasma ZIKV vRNA loads following rechallenge suggest that primary ZIKV

193

infection is sufficient to protect from detectable viremia in the blood.

194
195

Clinical evaluation of ZIKV rechallenged macaques

196

After initial ZIKV challenge and rechallenge, all five animals were monitored daily for

197

signs of disease (for example, inappetence, dehydration, diarrhea, injury, or

198

psychological abnormalities) and had complete blood counts (CBCs) evaluated.

199

Reference intervals (RIs) developed for Wisconsin National Primate Research Center

200

(WNPRC) animals for species, sex, and age were used to evaluate results [44].

201

After primary ZIKV infection, animal C1 presented a rash at the injection site. No other

202

clinical abnormalities were noted. Complete blood counts (CBCs) were evaluated for all

203

five animals three days prior to challenge, daily on days 0 through 10, 14, and again on

204

days 21 and 28 DPI. Mild monocytosis with levels exceeding the RI (0-3% of white

205

blood cells (WBC)) was reported for all animals before initial infection and persisted

206

throughout the duration of the study [44–47]. Animal C1 had lymphocyte levels dip

207

below the RI (20-80% WBC) on days 4 and 7 but rebounded back to within the normal

208

range by day 8. Animal C5 had high platelet counts exceeding the RI (229-524

209

thousands of platelets/uL) present at day -3 and persisted to be above the RI

210

throughout the study period [44–47].

211

After rechallenge, animals C1 and C4 developed inappetence 6 days post rechallenge.

212

Animal C1 also developed diarrhea at 6 days post rechallenge. All animals were

213

relocated to new housing 1 day prior to rechallenge which may have contributed to

214

inappetence and diarrhea. No other clinical abnormalities were noted (S1 Table). CBC

215

tests were evaluated for all five animals 3 days prior to, on the day of rechallenge, and

216

on days 3-7, 10, 14, and 28 post rechallenge (S2 Fig). After rechallenge, all animals

217

displayed persistent mild monocytosis with levels exceeding the RI across all days that

218

CBCs were evaluated. This persistence of monocytosis is consistent with that observed

219

following primary ZIKV infection [44–47]. The stress of frequent blood draws, sedation,

220

experimental infections, and living in captivity have all been associated with an

221

increased risk of monocytosis and lymphopenia potentially explaining these findings in

222

rechallenged animals [48–50].

223
224

Discussion

225

Since ZIKV could re-emerge in areas affected by the 2015 ZIKV outbreak, it is important

226

to evaluate the durability of ZIKV immunity following initial infection in order to

227

understand the risk of re-infection, particularly among women. This study shows that

228

initial ZIKV infection provides apparently protective immunity at least 27 months after

229

initial ZIKV infection. Primary ZIKV infection generated nAb titers above the 1:10

230

threshold deemed protective against re-infection for other flaviviruses (Fig 2) [11, 12].

231

These results showing protection from long term rechallenge have important

232

implications for vaccine design and testing. Protection from ZIKV infection following

233

vaccination is thought to require lasting MN50 log10 titers of 2.0 - 2.1, equivalent to log10

234

EC50 titers. [32]. In our study, prior to rechallenge, EC50 nAb titers were well above the

235

log10 2.0 threshold that Abbink et al., determined to be protective from ZIKV infection

236

[32]. Does the immunity observed in these animals provide sterilizing protection from

237

reinfection? While we did not detect any ZIKV RNA in the plasma following rechallenge,

238

nAb titers increased modestly. This suggests that ZIKV may replicate at levels below

239

the limit of detection in blood or in sanctuary tissues that are sequestered from the

240

blood. Conversely, it is possible that antigen present in the challenge virus itself was

241

sufficient to stimulate an expansion of pre-existing nAb responses. Others who have

242

encountered similar results have defined empirical thresholds for sterilizing immunity.

243

For example, Kirkpatrick et al. similarly observed a boost in nAb titers in DENV-

244

vaccinated animals following DENV challenge [51]. They defined an increase of less

245

than four-fold nAb titer as sterilizing immunity and a ≥ four-fold increase in nAb titer as

246

non-sterilizing immunity. In our study, two animals, C1 and C3, exhibited 2.5x increases

247

in nAb titer by 14 days post exposure. However, animals C2, C4, and C5 exhibited a

248

5.7x, 10.0x, and 7.6x increase, respectively, in nAb titer by 14 days post exposure.

249

Two animals used in our rechallenge study, C3 and C5, were previously part of a

250

published study that assessed fetal outcomes following ZIKV infection in utero [46]. This

251

study concluded that similar to human pregnancy, maternal-fetal transmission is highly

252

efficient with variable vRNA levels detected in all fetuses assessed. Despite a small

253

sample size in our rechallenge study (n = 2 animals initially infected during pregnancy),

254

we show that these animals develop immune responses similar to non-pregnant

255

animals. Following primary ZIKV infection during pregnancy in 2016, animal C5 has

256

gone on to give birth to two apparently healthy infants (in 2017 and 2018) and C3 has

257

gone on to give birth to one healthy infant (2019). While this study did not look at the

258

impacts of a ZIKV rechallenge during a second pregnancy, we show that subsequent

259

infants born to mothers who were previously infected with ZIKV are in qualitatively good

260

health. Future studies will need to determine if immunity elicited by a primary infection is

261

sufficient to protect a subsequent pregnancy from the effects of a ZIKV rechallenge

262

during pregnancy. Additionally, it will be important to characterize the extent of ZIKV-

263

specific antibody responses in infants exposed to ZIKV in utero.

264

In summary, our study establishes a new experimentally defined minimal length of

265

protective immunity against ZIKV of up to 27 months. Future longitudinal studies will

266

need to assess ZIKV immunity of previously infected individuals at longer time frames

267

than we have in order to continue to define the maximum length of immunity elicited by

268

natural ZIKV infection. Establishing the true maximum length of ZIKV protective

269

immunity will be critical for understanding outbreak dynamics, the future transmission

270

potential of ZIKV, and influence future vaccination strategies.

Ethics Statement

274

All rhesus macaques in this study were cared for by the staff at the Wisconsin National

275

Primate Research Center (WNPRC) in accordance with the regulations, guidelines, and

276

recommendations outlined in the Animal Welfare Act, the Guide for the Care and Use of

277

Laboratory Animals, and the Weatherall report [52–54]. The University of Wisconsin -

278

Madison, College of Letters and Science and Vice Chancellor for Research and

279

Graduate Education Centers Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved

280

the nonhuman primate research covered under protocol number G005401-R01. The

281

University of Wisconsin - Madison Institutional Biosafety Committee approved this work

282

under protocol number B00000117.

283

All animals were housed in enclosures with required floor space and fed using a

284

nutritional plan based on recommendations published by the National Research

285

Council. Animals were fed a fixed formula, extruded dry diet with adequate

286

carbohydrate, energy, fat, fiber, mineral, protein, and vitamin content. Macaque dry

287

diets were supplemented with fruits, vegetables, and other edible objects (e.g., nuts,

288

cereals, seed mixtures, yogurt, peanut butter, popcorn, marshmallows, etc.) to provide

289

variety to the diet and to inspire species-specific behaviors such as foraging. To further

290

promote psychological well-being, animals were provided with food enrichment,

291

structural enrichment, and/or manipulanda. Environmental enrichment objects were

292

selected to minimize chances of pathogen transmission from one animal to another and

293

from animals to care staff. While on study, all animals were evaluated by trained animal

294

care staff at least twice each day for signs of pain, distress, and illness by observing

295

appetite, stool quality, activity level, physical condition. Animals exhibiting abnormal

296

presentation for any of these clinical parameters were provided appropriate care by

297

attending veterinarians. Prior to all minor/brief experimental procedures, macaques

298

were anesthetized with an intramuscular dose of ketamine (10 ml kg-1) prior to virus

299

inoculation and blood collection and monitored regularly until fully recovered from

300

anesthesia. Per WNPRC standard operating procedures for animals assigned to

301

protocols involving the experimental inoculation of an infectious pathogen,

302

environmental enhancement included constant visual, auditory, and olfactory contact

303

with conspecifics, the provision of feeding devices which inspire foraging behavior, the

304

provision and rotation of novel manipulanda (e.g., Kong toys, nylabones, etc.), and

305

enclosure furniture (i.e., perches, shelves).

Virus Stocks

308

Zika virus/H.sapiens-tc/FRA/2013/FrenchPolynesia-01_v1c1 (ZIKV-FP) (GenBank

309

accession: KJ776791) was obtained from Xavier de Lamballerie (European Virus

310

Archive, Marseille, France) and passage history is described in Dudley et al. [44].

311

African lineage Zika virus (ZIKV-MR766), and Zika virus/H.sapiens-

312

tc/PUR/2015/PRVABC59 (GenBank accession: KU501215) were provided by Brandy

313

Russell (CDC, Ft. Collins, CO). ZIKV-MR766 passage history has been described in

314

Aliota et al [45]. Prior to rechallenge, animal C1 was previously infected with 104 PFU of

315

ZIKV-MR766 as described by Aliota et al. [45]. Animal C4 was previously infected with

316

106 PFU of ZIKV-FP as described by Dudley et al [44]. Animals C5 and C3 were

317

previously infected with 104 PFU of ZIKV-FP during their first and late second/early third

318

trimesters of pregnancy, respectively, as described by Nguyen et al. [46]. Animal C2

Inoculations

323

Virus stocks were thawed and diluted in PBS to 1 ✕ 104 PFU Zika virus/H.sapiens-

324

tc/PUR/2015/PRVABC59 (ZIKV-PR) for each challenge. Prepared virus stocks were

325

then loaded into a 1 ml syringe that was kept on ice until administration. Animals were

326

anesthetized as described above, and 1 ml of inocula was administered subcutaneously

327

over the cranial dorsum [44]. Animals were monitored for adverse reactions and signs of

328

disease by the veterinary and animal care staff of WNPRC.

329
330

Quantification of ZIKV RNA

331

Plasma and PBMC were isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood by Ficoll

332

density centrifugation at 1,860 x g for 30 min. Plasma was collected and centrifuged at

333

670 x g for an additional 8 min to remove remaining cells. Viral RNA was extracted from

334

300µL of plasma using the Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification kit (Promega, Madison,

335

WI, USA) on a Maxwell 48 RSC instrument (Promega, Madison, WI). The vRNA was

336

then quantified using quantitative RT-PCR previously described in Dudley et al. [44].

337

Briefly, the qRT-PCR was performed using SuperScript III Platinum One-Step

338

Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on a LightCycler 480 or

339

LightCyc instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Primers and probes

were used at final concentrations of 600 and 100 nM, respectively, with the addition of

341

150 ng random primers (Promega, Madison, WI). Cycling conditions were as follows:

342

37°C for 15 min, 50°C for 30 min, and 95°C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for

343

15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. Viral concentration was calculated by interpolation onto an

344

internal standard curve composed of seven 10-fold serial dilutions of a ZIKV RNA

345

fragment based on ZIKV-FP.

346

The limit of quantification for this assay was determined using methods adapted from

347

Cline et al [55]. Briefly, half-dilutions of ZIKV RNA were prepared to generate standard

348

curves from 3 to 1,000,000 copies. The overall positivity for each half dilution was

349

assessed by qRT-PCR. The limit of quantification for this assay was established at 100

350

copies/ml.

351
352

Immunophenotyping

353

The number of activated/proliferating NK cells, CD4, CD8, and CD8 TEM T cells were

354

quantified as described previously [56]. Briefly, 100µL of EDTA-anticoagulated whole

355

blood samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes with an antibody

356

master mix described by Dudley et al. [44]. Red blood cells were lysed using BD Pharm

357

Lyse (BD BioSciences, San Jose, CA), washed twice in media, and fixed with 125µL of

358

2% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. After fixation, cells were washed and

359

permeabilized using Bulk Permeabilization Reagent (Life Technologies, Madison, WI).

360

While the permeabilizer was present, the cells were stained for 15 minutes with Ki-67

361

(clone B56, Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate). The cells were then washed twice in media and

resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde until they were run on a BD LSRII Flow

363

Cytometer (BD BioSciences, San Jose, CA). Flow data were analyzed using Flowjo

364

version 10.5.3.

365
366

CBC tests

367

CBC tests were performed on EDTA-anticoagulated whole-blood samples using a

368

SYsmex XS-1000i automated haematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe,

369

Japan). CBC results were reported with species, age, and sex-specific reference

370

ranges. When samples are outside the laboratory-defined criteria (increased total WBC

371

counts, increased monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil percentages, decreased

372

hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet values, and unreported differential values) manual

373

slide evaluation was performed.

374
375

Flow cytometry-based neutralization assay

376

Macaque serum samples were screened for ZIKV nAbs by a flow-based ZIKV

377

neutralization assay adapted from Dowd et al [20]. Briefly, Vero cells (ATCC, CLR-

378

1587) were plated at a concentration of 2.5 ✕ 104 cells (100µl/well) in a 96 well plate

379

one and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours prior to ZIKV infection. Equal volumes of 1.9 ✕

380

102 PFU/mL ZIKV-PR and 1:4 serial serum dilutions were incubated for 30 minutes at

381

37°C before infecting duplicate wells. The plate was incubated for 72 hours at 37°C.

382

Following incubation, the plates were washed 5 times with 1 ✕ PBS and treated with

trypsin. After the cells separated from the plate, they were transferred to a cluster tube

384

and stained with a LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies,

385

Madison, W). The plate was incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, 1 mL of R10

386

media was added, and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 530 x g. Media was aspirated and

387

125µL of 2% PFA was added to fix the cells. The plates were incubated for 15 minutes

388

at room temperature, 1 mL of R10 media was added, and then they were centrifuged for

389

5 minutes at 530 x g. Media was aspirated and 100µL of Fix and Permeabilization

390

Medium B (Life Technologies, Madison, W) was added to permeabilize the cell

391

membrane. 2µl of a 1:10 dilution of the flavivirus-specific antibody, 4G2-A647 (Novus

392

Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA) stock was added to each well. The plate was

393

incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. 1 mL of R10 media was added, and the

394

plates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 530 x g. Media was aspirated and 125µL of 2%

395

PFA was added to fix the cells. Infection was monitored by flow cytometry on the BD

396

LSRII Flow Cytometer. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using Flowjo version 10.5.3.

397

Neutralization curves were generated using GraphPad Prism v. 8.0.1 (San Diego, CA).

398

The dilutions required to inhibit 50% and 90% of infection (EC50 and EC90 values)

399

were calculated using a non-linear regression model.

401

Statistical Analysis

402

Changes in immunophenotyping and CBC parameters from baseline were analyzed

403

with repeated measures ANOVA, for the populations where ANOVA proved significant,

404

we followed with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test comparing each day after

405

rechallenge back to 3 days before rechallenge.
