ABSTRACT
To understand the epigenetic foundation of naïve pluripotent cells, we implement a
quantitative multiplexed ChIP-Seq method (MINUTE-ChIP) comparing mouse ESC grown in
2i versus Serum conditions. Combined with quantitative western blot and mass
spectrometry, we find compelling evidence for a broad H3K27me3 hypermethylation of the
genome, concomitant with the widespread loss of DNA CpG methylation. We show that
opposing action of EZH2 and JMJD3/UTX shape the H3K27me3 landscape, with almost all
bivalent promoters stably retaining high H3K27me3 levels in 2i. In parallel, we show a
mechanistically uncoupled, global decrease of H3K4me3 and strong reduction at bivalent
promoters, suggesting that low H3K4me3 and high H3K27me3 levels at bivalent promoters
safeguard naïve pluripotency.

INTRODUCTION
The mouse pluripotent ground state is attributed to naïve epiblast cells of the inner cell mass
and can be recapitulated ​ex vivo through inhibition of GSK-3b and MAPK/ERK signaling in
mouse ESC (mESC) in serum-free conditions containing leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF)
and two respective inhibitors (CHIR99021 and PD0325901, referred to as “2i”) 1​​ . Traditional
serum-based culture in the presence of LIF (hereafter “Serum”) maintain a more metastable
ES cell phenotype. While rapidly interconvertible through change in media condition,
significant differences in signaling, metabolism, transcriptional regulation, epigenomes and
nuclear organization between the two states have been reported 1–7​
​ . Given that metabolic
changes often induce global shifts in histone modification patterns, we reasoned that
revisiting existing paradigms on epigenomic changes between the two states in a
quantitative manner would be warranted. We implemented a multiplexed ChIP-Seq method
to compare epigenetic profiles between 2i and Serum conditions. We focused on two histone
modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 known to constitute developmentally important
bivalent chromatin domains 8​​ . Prior studies agree on a model where bivalent domains are
resolved in ground state pluripotent cell into H3K4me3-only domains through the loss of
H3K27me3 2–5,9,10​
​
.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Barcoding-first ChIP techniques have gained popularity because of the combined benefit of
multiplexing and quantitative readout 11–14​
​
. Pooling barcoded samples greatly increases
throughput without complicated automation, while effectively removing technical variability
between samples. Challenges remain for fragmentation and ligation of crude chromatin in a
manner that maximizes barcoding efficiency while avoiding any technical variability or
sample loss that could confound the subsequent quantitative measurement. Mint-ChIP,
developed by the Bernstein lab 12​
​ , provides a formidable solution for these problems with a
streamlined one-pot chromatin barcoding and a post-ChIP linear amplification that requires
only one adaptor per chromatin fragment. In short, native chromatin is fragmented using
Micrococcal nuclease, and subsequently blunted and ligated to double-stranded DNA
adaptors that include a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a sample barcode sequence.
Finally, samples are combined and subsequent ChIP reactions are performed with the
pooled samples. ChIP material is prepared into an Illumina-compatible library using linear
amplification by virtue of T7 RNA polymerase, reverse transcription and a low-cycle library
PCR amplification 12​
​ .
Here, we introduce unique molecule (UMI) counting and paired-end mapping of the
chromatin fragments to this method, which we then termed MINUTE-ChIP for multiplexed
indexed unique molecule T7 amplification end-to-end sequencing ​(Figure 1a, Supplementary
Table 1)​. Double-stranded DNA adaptors were used to barcode chromatin in a blunt-end
ligation reaction. As in the original Mint-ChIP design, adaptors carried a partial SBS3 for
Illumina sequencing flanked by a T7 RNA Polymerase for linear amplification. Between the
SBS3 sequence and a 8bp sample barcode at the 3’ end, a 6bp randomized sequence was
introduced, serving as a unique molecular identifier (UMI). Using UMI information in addition
to the ligated genomic sequence greatly increases the confidence in calling amplification

duplicates and improves the quantitative representation of repetitive sequencing
(Supplementary Figure 1a)​. Pooling a human HeLa cell sample with the mouse ESC
samples, adaptor-crosscomination was assessed to be very low, with a maximum of 1.5%
mapping to the respective other species. ​(Supplementary Figure 1b)​. For paired-end
mapping, we modify the linear amplification strategy introduced in Mint-ChIP by priming the
cDNA synthesis from a 3’ RNA adaptor, thus maintaining the original genomic fragment
length, retrieving a typical mononucleosomal fragment length for histone ChIP
(Supplementary Figure 1c, Supplementary Table 1)​. As previously reported 12​
​ , barcode
representation in the pool may vary amongst samples, even at precisely matched adaptor
DNA concentration. For accurate quantification, barcode representation after the ChIP has to
be related back to the corresponding quantities in the input pool. A common issue of
indexing-first ChIP protocols is that adaptors added in excess are carried over into the input
pool. Amplification products from free adaptors, adaptor dimers or other side reactions
contribute contaminating sequences to an extent that sequencing of the input pool becomes
unfeasible. Thus we have optimized the stoichiometry of adaptors to chromatin to enable
sequencing of the input. Quantification against input representation is robust, as exemplified
by a H3 ChIP from a pool containing two series of biological triplicate samples with varying
input representation; all replicates lie within 10% variance ​(Figure 1b, Supplementary Figure
2, Supplementary Table 2)​.
High levels of H3K27me3 and low levels of H3K4me3 characterize 2i ground state
Here, we performed three independent MINUTE-ChIP experiments, “Pool 1” comparing
Serum and serum-free 2i conditions, “Pool 2” comparing Serum condition without or with 2i
“2i/Serum”, and “Pool 3” including conditions with inhibitors against the H3K27me3
methyltransferase EZH2 and demethylases JMJD3/UTX ​(Supplementary Figure 3)​.
Unexpectedly, quantitation of these three MINUTE-ChIP experiments, using three different
H3K27me3 antibodies, (for details and primary data see ​Supplementary Table 2​) all reported
two-fold higher levels of H3K27me3 in the presence of 2i (​Figure 1c-f). ​We used both mass
spectrometry and quantitative western blot to validate our finding. Indeed, both
measurements suggested an increase in total H3K27me3 (Figure 2c, 2d; 1.5-fold and
1.7-fold, respectively) ​(Supplementary Figure 4)​. These results are surprising particularly on
the background of the widely accepted model that H3K27me3 is lost from Polycomb targets
such as bivalent domains and Hox gene clusters 2–5,9,10,15​
​
. ​However, a recent study also
reassessed H3K27me3 levels in a quantitative manner and reports a similar global increase,
concomitant with a gain in PRC2 components 16​
​ .
Surprisingly, we also found significant perturbation of the H3K4me3 levels, but in a different
pattern: Global H3K4me3 levels were 1.8-fold decreased in 2i but not 2i/Serum ​(Figure 1c)​,
also evident from quantitative western blot ​(Supplementary Figure 4)​, representing another
global difference that previously escaped observation. This suggests that independent
mechanism regulate H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 levels. The former is linked to the action of 2i
inhibitors, whereas H3K4me3 levels are insensitive to 2i inhibitors but respond to removal of
serum.
Next, we wondered how these significant global perturbations of histone modifications would
affect local chromatin environments. A first inspection suggested a broad gain in H3K27me3

across gene-poor regions and unchanged enrichments at peaks corresponding to bivalent
promoters ​(Figure 1g)​. As an exception to this, Hox clusters showed a variable reduction in
H3K27me3, albeit much less pronounced than previously described 3,16​
​ . However a region in
the Hoxc cluster (Hoxc12-c13), shown to be transcriptionally activated in 2i, was also fully
depleted of H3K27me3 in our experiment (​Supplementary Fig 5​). Further, UMI deduplication
allowed us to also quantitatively compare relative enrichment of histone modifications
between the annotated genome and repetitive regions. H3K27me3 was relatively depleted
from major and minor satellite repeats in Serum but increased in 2i albeit below the genome
average (​Supplementary Figure 6​).
The H3K4me3 landscape appeared unaltered in 2i/Serum. In 2i however, most H3K4me3
peaks appeared reduced, most prominently at bivalent promoters ​(Figure 1g)​. Notably, it has
been previously shown that bivalent promoters show somewhat reduced H3K4me3 in 2i
condition, and that this is a rapid response within 24 hours of switching Serum-grown cells
into 2i condition 5​​ . This lead us to hypothesize that high H3K27me3 and low H3K4me3 are
two mechanistically unlinked characteristics of the ground state, and that the 2i/Serum
conditions allows to stabilize a normally transient intermediate between Serum and 2i
conditions.
Polycomb binding sites maintain high levels of H3K27me3 in 2i
The enzymes responsible for methylation and demethylation of histone H3K27 are well
established: EZH2 is the enzymatic subunit of PRC2 that catalyzes all three H3K27
methylation states; Two demethylases, UTX and JMJD3, are known to convert H3K27me3 to
H3K27me1 (​Figure 1e​). Thus, we were particularly interested how the H3K27 methylation
landscape of ground state pluripotency is sculpted by these two activities and profiled
H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 (Pool 3). We focussed on well-described polycomb (PcG)
binding sites combining EZH2 and Ring1b published peak sets (​Figure 2a, Supplementary
Figure 7​). Notably, average H3K27me3 levels at the peak were unchanged in 2i, whereas
neighbouring regions gained H3K27me3, concomitant with a loss of H3K27me1 (​Figure 2a​).
In fact, H3K27me3 was gained roughly two-fold, genome wide across most genomic
contexts with the notable exception of several transposable elements, e.g. IAP ERVs
(​Supplementary Figures 6, 8​). Such global shift confounds traditional ChIP-Seq analyses
which are normalized based on the assumption of a stable technical background
(​Supplementary Figure 9​).
Pervasive H3K27me3 modification is a hallmark of mouse ESC and further
exacerbated in 2i conditions
In any ChIP experiment, a certain level of technical background is expected from
unspecifically retained DNA contamination. To determine the technical background and
dynamic range of our MINUTE-ChIP experiments, we evaluated H3K27me3 ChIP in the
presence of an EZH2 inhibitor EPZ-6438 17​
​ , hereafter (EZH2i). Notably, barcodes for the
EZH2i treated samples were depleted 14 to 30-fold from the pool after ChIP. Treatment with
GSK-J4 an inhibitor of UTX and JMJD3 on the other hand, resulted in a 6-fold increase
(​Figure 1f, Supplementary Figure 10​). Thus, technical background is extremely low,

contributing roughly 1% of the maximal signal. Even at regions known to be devoid of
H3K27me3, such as highly transcribed genes, this technical background is substantially
below the measured signal (​Figure 2b​). This observation has important implications to
interpreting our, or any, H3K27me3 ChIP profiles: H3K27me3 modifications are omnipresent
on nucleosomes at substantial densities across the genome. Despite the high local density
(up to 100% as suggested by calibrated ChIP 18​
​ ), only a small fraction (3.6% in Serum and
2.0% in 2i) of H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes reside in PcG target regions (​Figure 2c​).
Mechanistically this implies, for example, that any effector proteins downstream of
H3K27me3 must be exquisitely sensitive to the density of H3K27me3 present on the
chromatin fiber to selectively bind PcG target regions and not be titrated away by bulk
H3K27me3 in the rest of the genome.
Gain in H3K27me3 follows the loss of CpG methylation
Turning back to our question of how ground state pluripotency invokes a broad increase in
H3K27me3 at non-PcG targets, we noted similarities to a previously observed retargeting of
PRC2 in mESC devoid of CpGme 7,19​
​ . A known feature of ground state ESC is a strong
decrease in 5-methyl cytosine methylation at CpG dinucleotides (CpGme) 5–7​
​ . Indeed,
H3K27me3 is predominantly gained in regions that switch from high to low CpGme levels in
2i (​Supplementary Figure 11​). ERV families which are known to retain high levels of CpGme
during germline reprogramming and also in 2i 6,7,20​
​
, continue to be depleted of H3K27me3
(​Supplementary Figure 6​). Regions with constitutively low CpGme, such as the
above-mentioned PcG target sites, stably maintain their high H3K27me3 levels. Depleting
CpGme with Zebularin in Serum or 2i condition very broadly increased H3K27me3, thus in a
less specific way then the Serum-2i transition. This can be explained by the fact that cells in
2i conditions are not completely devoid of DNA methylation. While our results corroborate
the hypothesis that unmethylated CpGs are a major determinant of the H3K27me3
landscape, the ground state epigenome certainly underlies are more complex regulation
since Zebularin treatment e.g. did not recapitulate the specific loss of H3K27me3 at Hoxc
cluster. This is in line with the large body of evidence that DNMT knockout or otherwise
reduced CpG levels per se do not induce the pluripotent ground state 5–7,19​
​
. Nevertheless, it
may be speculated that CpG demethylation is necessary albeit not sufficient for H3K27me3
hypermethylation and naive state. In fact, a recent bioRxiv preprint suggests that restoration
of Serum-like DNA methylation in the naive state also reverts back the H3K27me3
landscape, albeit the cell maintains a naive transcriptome and phenotype 21​
​ . Vice versa,
-/H3K27me3-deficient EED​ mESC have been shown to exhibit increased CpG methylation in
2i 22​
​ , while also maintaining the naive transcriptome 5​​ .
Active demethylation limits H3K27me3 levels genome-wide
GSK-4 treatment further revealed that demethylases UTX and JMJD3 limit H3K27me3 levels
both at PcG targets and genome-wide (​Figure 2d, 1f, Supplementary Figure 12​). Analysis of
the gain/loss of H3K27me3 according to initial H3K27me3 quantiles in serum revealed that
GSK-J4 favors accumulation of H3K27me3 in regions exhibiting low to very low H3K27me3
while affecting H3K27me high regions to a lesser extent (​Supplementary Figure 12a​). This
would fit to a model in which UTX/JMJD3 act relatively unspecific on H3K27me3 scattered

across the genome, limiting it’s abundance predominantly non-Polycomb targets. Such
model is also in agreement with genome-wide maps of UTX/JMJD3 that found a relatively
flat distribution with weak enrichment at active gene promoters rather than Polycomb targets
23,24​
. Interestingly, GSK-J4 treatment assimilated H3K27me3 genome-wide distribution in
serum and 2i almost completely (​Supplementary Figure 12b​). Thus, it remains to be
determined if and how their localization and/or activity is modulated by the Serum-to-2i
transition. In summary, PRC2 and UTX/JMJD3 jointly balance H3K27me3 level in both
serum and 2i conditions.
Maintenance of H3K27me3 and loss of H3K4me3 at bivalent promoters
Compared to Serum condition, the 2i ground state is characterized by low expression of
particular lineage-specific transcription factors that are thought to prime differentiation. The
apparent loss of H3K27me3 at the bivalent promoters of these genes has been difficult to
reconcile with a repressive role of the modification, and the fact the the target genes were
maintained silent 3​​ . Overlapping largely with the PcG target sites discussed above, we find
that H3K27me3 is quantitatively maintained at the ~2000 bivalent promoters (​Figure 3a-c,
Supplementary Figure 13​). While individual datasets showed more variability in H3K27me3
peaks, 171 promoters lost and 126 gained H3K27me3 consistently more than 1.5-fold
across our three independent MINUTE-ChIP experiments (​Figure 3d, Supplementary Figure
14​). Those gaining H3K27me3 were strongly downregulated. Those losing H3K27me3
included Hox clusters and regions previously shown to interact with Hox clusters 4​​ , and
showed a variable degree of upregulation (​Supplementary Figure 15​). Thus, our quantitative
data reconciles apparent discrepancies arising from non-quantitative data and agrees with
the common notion that H3K27me3 is anticorrelated with transcriptional activity.
The global reduction of H3K4me3 (​Figure 1c​) in 2i condition manifested in reduced peak
sizes across all genes, but most strikingly at Hox genes and bivalent promoters. While active
genes on average lost ~35% of H3K4me3, bivalent promoters showed a more than 2-fold
decrease in H3K4me3 (​Figure 3a-c​). This is in line with prior observations that H3K4m3
levels are reduced in 2i conditions with relative to other promoters 5​​ . While loss of H3K4me3
has no apparent effect on the transcriptional output of active genes, the more dramatic loss
at bivalent genes, in the presence of similar H3K27me3 levels, may account for the small but
consistent decrease in transcription from bivalent genes (​Figure 3a, Supplementary Figure
15​).
While necessary for survival in the absence of 2i, serum primes mESC for differentiation.
Our data suggests that high H3K4me3 at bivalent genes is a molecular manifestation of the
serum-primed state. Indeed, a recent report suggests that H3K4me3 specifies the robust
and timely induction of bivalent promoters during differentiation 25​
​ . Given that H3K27me3 is
per se dispensable for ground state pluripotency 5,16​
​ , we hypothesize that low H3K4me3
together with high H3K27me3 levels at bivalent promoters act to safeguard the ground state
of pluripotency. Our study highlights the importance of performing quantitative ChIP
experiments by uncovering unexpected global shifts in histone modifications that have
confounded prior non-quantitative studies.

METHODS
Cell Culture
Rw4 murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were cultured feeder-free in 0.1% gelatin-coated
dishes. Serum condition: ​Knockout DMEM (Life Technologies), 2 mM Glutamax (Gibco), 0.1
mM non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 15% ESC-grade fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco),
0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Millipore), 2i/Serum
condition: above medium supplemented with ​2i; 1 μM MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (Sigma)
and 3 μM GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 (Sigma). 2i condition: serum free ESGRO Complete
Basal medium (Millipore) with 0.1mM LIF and 2i as described above. For drug treatment,
mESCs were grown in respective medium supplemented with 10 μM GSK-J4 (Sigma) for 96
h, 50 μM Zebularin for 96 h or 10 μM EPZ-6438 (BioVision) for 7 days​. ​For all conditions
cells were passaged in 48 h intervals, using accutase (Sigma) for detachment. ​Cell line was
tested for mycoplasma contamination.
Immunoblot Analysis
1x10​6 ​cells were harvested for each growth condition​, ​washed twice with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) and lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (0.1%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Hepes [pH 7.6], 1 mM EDTA, 5%
glycerol and 140 mM NaCl) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC, Roche) on
ice for 10 min. For the drug treated conditions, 10 μl of lysate from the ChIP sample was
used for the analysis directly. Lysates were homogenized by sonication for 8-10 cycles at
high power, 30 seconds on/off in a Bioruptor sonicator (Cosmo Bio Co. Ltd.). Samples were
boiled at 95 °C for 10 mins with ​6×SDS sample buffer before loading onto ​4–20%
Tris-glycine gels (BioRad)​. Resolved proteins were transferred to ​nitrocellulose membranes
using the Trans-Blot​®​ ​Turbo system (BioRad) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Membranes were then blocked for 1 h in 1% casein prepared in ​Tris-buffered saline and
0.1% Tween-20 ​(TBS-T) before blotting with respective primary antibodies diluted in TBST,
overnight at 4°C. Blots were washed three times with TBST and incubated with secondary
antibody in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature (protect from light). Post three TBST
washes, the membranes were imaged on a LI-COR Odyssey​ ®​​ FC system​. Quantitation of
signal and analysis was performed using the LI-COR Image studio software. Primary
antibodies included total H3 1:10,000 (Active motif 39763), H3K4me3 1: 5000 (Millipore
04-745), H3K27me3 1: 5000 (Millipore 07-449). The secondary antibodies were IRDye​®
680RD anti-rabbit and IRDye​®​ 800CW anti-mouse (LI-COR) at 1:5000 dilution. Full western
blot images have been included in the Supplementary Information.
Mass Spectrometry
5x10​6​ mESCs per growth condition (serum or 2i) were harvested, washed once with PBS,
spun down at 800 g for 5 min. The cell pellets were flash frozen and sent to ActiveMotif for
their Mod Spec​®​ service. Briefly, histones were acid extracted, derivatized via propionylation,
digested with trypsin, newly formed N-termini were propionylated, and then measured three
seperate times using the Thermo Scientific TSQ Quantum Ultra mass spectrometer coupled
with an UltiMate 3000 Dionex nano-liquid chromatography system. The data was quantified
using Skyline, and represents the percent of each modification within the total pool of that
tryptic peptide.

MINUTE-ChIP
One-pot chromatin fragmentation and barcoding​: MINUTE-ChIP and library preparation
protocol is based on the Mint-ChIP protocol developed by the Bernstein lab 12​
​ , with
modifications as follows: 1x10​6 ​cells were harvested for each growth condition, washed
twice with PBS and cell pellets were flash frozen at -80°C prior to use. Cells were
resuspended in 50 μl PBS, lysed and digested to ​mono- to tri-nucleosomes​ fragments by
adding 50 μl of 2x Lysis buffer (​100 mM Tris-HCL [pH 8.0], 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium
deoxycholate, 10 mM CaCl​2 and
1x PIC​) containing 2U/μl of ​micrococcal nuclease ​(New
​
England BioLabs, M0247S) and incubating on ice for 20 min and then 37°C for 10 min. For
each sample, 40 μl of the whole cell lysate containing the digested chromatin was taken
forward into an overnight blunt end ligation reaction (End-It DNA repair kit and Fast-Link
DNA ligation kit, Epicentre) with double stranded DNA adapters at 16°C. As in the original
Mint-ChIP design, adaptors carried a partial SBS3 for Illumina sequencing flanked by a T7
RNA Polymerase for linear amplification. Between the SBS3 sequence and a 8bp sample
barcode at the 3’ end, a 6bp randomized sequence was introduced, serving as a unique
molecular identifier (UMI) (Figure 1a). UMI and sample barcode are ligated 5’ to the
chromatin fragment and constitute the first 14 bases of read 1. The 4096 possible UMIs
provide sufficient diversity to distinguish if two reads mapping to the exact same genomic
location arose from a PCR amplification artifact or are indeed unique molecule. The adapter
concentration was optimized to 2.5 μM / reaction to reduce adapter dimers. The ligation
reaction was terminated with a lysis dilution buffer ​(50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl,
1% Triton X-100, 50 mM EGTA, 50 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 1x PIC)​ and
barcoded samples were combined into a single pool, spun down at 24,000 r.p.m. for 10 min
at 4°C.
Immunoprecipitation​: 50μl Protein A/G magnetic beads (BioRad) were washed twice with
PBS-T (PBS+ 0.1% Tween 20) and coupled to one of the following antibodies in the same
buffer for 1 hr at room temperature with rotation: 3 μl H3 (Active motif 39763), 5 μl H3K4me3
(Millipore 04-745), 5 μl H3K27me1 (Cell signaling 5326S), or 5 μl H3K27me3 (Cell signaling
9733 or Diagenode C15410195 or Millipore 07-449). Beads were then washed quickly with
RIPA buffer. 200-400 μl of the cleared lysate pool was added to the pre-coupled magnetic
beads and parallel ChIP assays were incubated further for 4 h at 4°C with rotation. 5% of the
above volume was saved as the input pool and processed through the remaining protocol in
a manner similar to the IPs. Next, the beads were washed (RIPA, RIPA high salt, LiCl and
TE buffer) resuspended in ChIP elution ​buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 0.1%
SDS, and 300 mM NaCl)​ containing 0.25 mg/mL Proteinase K and eluted at 63°C for 1 h.
Linear amplification and library preparation​: The native ChIP DNA (fragments longer than
100bp) was isolated using 1x SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter) and set up in an overnight ​in
vitro​ transcription reaction (HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis kit, New England
BioLabs). The resulting RNA was purified using Silane beads (Life Technologies) and an
RNA 3’ adapter​ was ligated onto it using T4 RNA ligase, truncated (New England BioLabs)
for 1 h at 25°C. The mixture was subsequently supplemented with components of the
reverse transcription reaction (SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix, Life
Technologies) to produce cDNA, primed using the ligated 3’ adapter. Final libraries for each

ChIP were produced using 150-200 ng of purified cDNA in a PCR reaction (High-Fidelity 2x
master mix, New England BioLabs) for 8 cycles with 0.2 μM primers that carried a second
8bp barcode sequence. Quality assessment and concentration estimation of the purified
DNA was done using the Qubit (Life Technologies) and BioAnalyzer (Agilent). Each library
was then diluted to 4 nM and combined into a single pool before sequencing on the Illumina
NextSeq500 platform.
MINUTE-ChIP Quantitative Mapping Pipeline
Demultiplexing and deduplication​: Sequencing was performed using 50:8:34 cycles
(Read1:Index1:Read2) Illumina bcl2fastq was used to demultiplex paired-end sequencing
reads by 8nt index1 read (PCR barcode). NextSeq lanes were merged into single fastq files,
creating the primary fastq files. Read1 starts with 6nt UMI and 8nt barcode in the format
NNNNNNABCDEFGH. A sample sheet was used with four columns corresponding to
sample name, replicate name, barcode sequence, primary fastq name. For each line in the
sample sheet, reads matching the barcode sequence were extracted from the primary fastq
file, allowing up to two mismatches. Duplicate reads identified by identical first 24nt of read1
were discarded. Read pairs matching parts of the adaptor sequence (SBS3 or T7 promoter)
in either read1 or read2 were removed. Demultiplexed and deduplicated reads were written
into sample-specific fastq file used for subsequent mapping.
Mapping​: Sample-specific paired fastq files were mapped using botwie2 (v2.3.4.3) using
--fast parameter to the mouse genome (mm9). Alignments were processed into sorted BAM
files with samtools (v1.9). Blacklisted regions were removed from BAM file using BEDTools
(v2.27.1). Reads were also mapped to a metagenome of RepBase murine repetitive
sequences using botwie2.
Generation of coverage tracks and quantitative scaling​: Input coverage tracks with 1bp
resolution in BigWig format were generated from BAM files using deepTools (v3.1.0)
bamCoverage and scaled to a reads-per-genome-coverage of one (1xRPGC, also referred
to as ‘1x normalization’) using mm9 genome size 2654895218. ChIP coverage tracks were
generated from BAM files using deepTools (v3.1.0) bamCoverage. Quantitative scaling
amongst samples within each pool was based on their total mapped read counts, as well as
the total mapped read counts of the respective input data. One condition in the pool served
as a reference (Serum condition, no treatment), which was scaled to 1xRPGC. All other
samples were scaled relative to the reference using an explicit scaling factor. The RPGC
was calculate by the following formula: ( #mapped[ChIP] / #mapped[Input] ) / (
#mapped[ChIP_Reference] / #mapped[Input_Reference] ).
Genome statistics​: Total mapped read counts from BAM files were used calculate relative
global levels of histone modifications. Statistics on genomic bins or custom intervals were
calculated from scaled BigWig files using bwtool summary. For calculation of enrichments in
repetitive regions, mapped read counts for ChIP and Input of the repetitive sequences were
Put in relation to the respective total mapped reads counts of the mm9 genome and scaled
with the same scaling factor.

Track visualization​: Heatmaps were generated from scaled BigWig files and clustered with
SeqPlots using a 50bp moving window average smoothing. Density plots were generated
directly from BAM files using ngs.plot with modifications: the in-built genome averaging was
removed and replaced by a scaling factor calculated from the aligned read counts as above (
#mapped[ChIP] / #mapped[Input] ) / ( #mapped[ChIP_Reference] /
#mapped[Input_Reference] ). Equivalent plots can be generated using SeqPlots from scaled
BigWig files. For IGV visualization, a variable smoothing was applied depending on the size
of the genomic region.
Quality control​: Picard (v2.10.3) was used to determine insert size distribution, duplication
rate, estimated library size. For the latter, primary reads were demultiplexed separately from
the procedure described above retaining all duplicate reads and mapped using bowtie2
before running Picard MarkDuplicates. For estimation of cross contamination, mm9 and
hg19 fasta files were combined to build a hybrid botwie2 index and used for mapping the
reads.
GEO datasets: ​Following published datasets were used: RNA-Seq Serum vs 2i 3,26
​
(GSM590124, GSM590125, GSM590126, GSM590127, GSM2345133, GSM2345139), CpG

Supplementary Figure 6​ – related to Figure 1 – ​a​ Comparison of the three H3K27me3
datasets comparing Serum and 2i conditions acquired from two independent pools and three
different H3K27me3 antibodies. Relative enrichments of H3K27me3 in Serum and 2i
conditions, over 17 functionally defined chromatin states (ChromHMM). ​b​ Relative
enrichments of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, in Serum and 2i conditions, over repetitive
regions of the genome using reads mapped to a metagenome of repetitive sequences from
RepBase 29​
​ . ​c ​Hierarchical clustering shows that present datasets cluster with prior
H3K27me3 data from Serum vs 2i comparison 3​​ . Pearsson correlation was calculated on
10kb bins of the mm9 genome after removing outliers and blacklisted regions.

Supplementary Figure 7​ – related to Figure 2 – Heatmaps over 2731​ PcG target sites

defined by EZH2 or Ring1b binding. Peak locations were from acquired from
published datasets (USCS Genome Browser and 4​​ ). Suz12 and Ring1b 4​​ were plotted
and used for clustering alongside of H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 data.

Supplementary Figure 8​ – related to Figure 2 – ​a​ Genome-wide analysis of 10kb windows.
Levels of H3K27me3 (expressed as RPGC relative to Serum) were determined per bin and
plotted in a 2D comparison. A color scale was used to overlay H3K4me3 levels of each bin.
H3K27me3 increased almost universally across the genome in 2i/serum or 2i. As an
exception, the most extreme high regions of H3K27me3 (which coincided with high
H3K4me3) did not further increase in H3K27me3. ​b​ Levels of H3K4me3 (expressed as
RPGC relative to Serum) were determined per bin and plotted in a 2D comparison. A color
scale was used to overlay H3K27me3 levels of each bin. H3K4me3 levels on the other hand
were globally unchanged in 2i/serum. Loss of H3K4me3 in 2i was limited to H3K4me3-high
regions, corresponding to active (H3K27me3 low) and bivalent (H3K27me3 high) regions.
c​ H3K27me3 bins as in a) were overlaid with H3K36me3 density color, showing that
H3K36me3-high regions (regions of highly active transcriptional elongation) were most
depleted in H3K27me3, but still gained H3K27me3 in 2i condition.
Supplementary Figure 9​ – related to Figure 2 – Average plot over 2731 PcG target sites
using per-sample normalization. Because of increase in background H3K27me3 levels, the
peak size appears dramatically reduced.
Supplementary Figure 10​ – related to Figure 2 –Background and dynamic range of
MINUTE-ChIP method as determined by modulating H3K27me3 levels. Relative abundance

treatments in Serum.
Supplementary Figure 11​ – related to Figure 2 – H3K27me3 follows loss of CpG
methylation. ​a​ H3K27me3 and CpG methylation 7​​ levels in Serum and 2i conditions were
determined in 10kb windows and plotted against each other. The gain of H3K27me3
observed in the bulk of 10kb windows in 2i is concomitant to a loss of CpG methylation. ​b
10kb bins were partitioned in 1, 5, 50, 95, 99th quantiles according to H3K27me3 levels in
Serum. Regions overlapping with hox genes were analyzed separately. Overlay of their
levels in 2i shows an increase inversely related to the original level, with the most devoid

regions showing the largest fold-change. CpG methylation and H3K27me3 was largely
anticorrelated ​c​ Levels of H3K27me3 (expressed as RPGC relative to Serum) were plotted
in a 2D comparison. A color scale was used to overlay the CpGme levels of each bin. Bins
high in H3K27me3 were constitutively unmethylated and did not gain H3K27me3. ​d​ Average
profile of H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 levels at PcG target, in Serum and 2i condition, as well
as after treatment with DNMT inhibitor Zebularin for 4 days. Y axis is normalized to RPGC in
Serum. ​e​ Quantile analysis as in b) shoes that Zebularin treatment promotes
hypomethylation across all quantiles, and a particularly strong increase in H3K27me3 at the
low end. ​f​ Comparison of Zebularin treatment and DNMT3a/b knockout (DKO),
DNMT1/3a/3b knockout (TKO), in modulating H3K27me3 levels accross functional chromatin
states. Since available data for DNMT KO was not performed quantitative, we normalized
data according to State 10. Zebularin treatment and DNMT DKO/TKO exhibit similar shifts in
H3K27me3, which is qualitatively similar but not identical to 2i. Note that DNMT DKO and
TKO profiles also clustered with 2i samples in a correlation analysis (Supplementary Figure
6c)
Supplementary Figure 12​ – related to Figure 2 – Inhibiting demethylases globally
increases H3K27me3 levels. ​a​ 10kb bins were partitioned in 1, 5, 50, 95, 99th quantiles
according to H3K27me3 levels in Serum. Regions overlapping with hox genes were
analyzed separately. Overlay of the GSK-J4 treatment (4 days) shows that H3K27me3 levels
are increased across all quantiles. ​b​ GSK-J4 effect on H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 levels
analyzed by functional chromatin states. Increase in H3K27me3 upon GSK-J4 treatment is
mirrored by a reduction of H3K27me1, the product of H3K27me3 demethylases.
Supplementary Figure 13​ – related to Figure 3 – ​a​ Average plots of H3K27me3 levels at
bivalent genes produced by three different antibodies from 2 different pools. ​b​ H3K27me3
and H3K4me3 levels in Serum, 2i, 2i/Serum by functional chromatin state. Also see global
levels shown in Figure 1c. It is apparent that changes to the H3K27me3 landscape in 2i are
largely mirrored by 2i addition to Serum condition (top). In contrast, 2i/Serum is very similar
to both Serum datasets, and does not exhibit the strong reduction of H3K4me3 in 2i.
H3K4me3 is lost most dramatically (>2.5-fold reduction) from State 10 “Poised_Promoters”
that are bivalent. Active promoters are reduced ~2-fold.
Supplementary Figure 14​ – related to Figure 3 – Examples of bivalent genes that lose or
gain H3K27me3 in 2i condition more than two-fold. Notably, all promoters also lose
H3K4me3, independent of the gain or loss of H3K27me3.
Supplementary Figure 15 ​ – related to Figure 3 –​ ​RNA-Seq expression of bivalent genes
in Serum and 2i. Those genes that consistently gain (n=126) or lose (n=171) H3K27me3
were analyzed separately. RNA-Seq data from different studies was used 3,26​
