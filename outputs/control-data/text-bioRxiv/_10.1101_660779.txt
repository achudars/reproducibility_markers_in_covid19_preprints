Abstract
Active retrotransposons in the human genome (L1, Alu and SVA elements) can create genomic mobile
element insertions (MEIs) in both germline and somatic tissue1. Specific somatic MEIs have been
detected at high levels in human cancers2, and at lower to medium levels in human brains3. Dysregulation
of somatic retrotransposition in the human brain has been hypothesized to contribute to neuropsychiatric
diseases4,5. However, individual somatic MEIs are present in small proportions of cells at a given
anatomical location, and thus standard whole-genome sequencing (WGS) presents a difficult signal-tonoise problem, while single-cell approaches suffer from limited scalability and experimental artifacts
introduced by enzymatic whole-genome amplification6. Previous studies produced widely differing
estimates for the somatic retrotransposition rates in human brain3,6–8. Here, we present a highly precise
machine learning method (RetroSom) to directly identify somatic L1 and Alu insertions in <1% cells from
200× deep WGS, which allows circumventing the restrictions of whole-genome amplification. Using
RetroSom we confirmed a lower rate of retrotransposition for individual somatic L1 insertions in human
neurons. We discovered that anatomical distribution of somatic L1 insertion is as widespread in glia as in
neurons, and across both hemispheres of the brain, indicating retrotransposition occurs during early
embryogenesis. We characterized two of the detected brain-specific L1 insertions in great detail in
neurons and glia from a donor with schizophrenia. Both insertions are within introns of genes active in
brain (CNNM2, FRMD4A) in regions with multiple genetic associations with neuropsychiatric disorders9–
11

. Gene expression was significantly reduced by both somatic insertions in a reporter assay. Our results

provide novel insights into the potential for pathological effects of somatic retrotransposition in the
human brain, now including the large glial fraction. RetroSom has broad applicability in all disease states
where somatic retrotransposition is expected to play a role, such as autoimmune disorders and cancer.

Introduction
Recent studies reporting on brain somatic MEIs have addressed the signal-to-noise problem to detect
somatic MEIs either with a capture approach such as retrotransposon capture sequencing (RC-seq) from
bulk brain tissue12, or with single-cell methods (because a somatic MEI is heterozygous within each
mutated cell) including single-cell L1 insertion profiling (L1-IP)13, single-cell WGS (sc-WGS)3, and
single-cell L1-associated variant sequencing (SLAV-seq)8. A limitation of these methods stems from the
frequent occurrence of sequencing artifacts from chimeric DNA molecules resulting from the high
numbers of PCR cycles (capture) or massive enzymatic whole-genome amplification (sc-WGS)6. It is also
expensive to apply sc-WGS to, e.g., hundreds of cells in each of multiple brains and brain regions. An
additional problem with any WGS approach is that MEI detection relies on uniquely mapping highly
repetitive sequencing reads which remain difficult to resolve.

A less biased and more cost-effective approach is to identify somatic MEIs in deep ‘bulk-sequencing’
data: whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of genomic DNA extracted from bulk tissue, typically from over
10,000 cells (Fig. 1A, B). As in other methods14–17, MEI detection is then based on two types of
sequencing reads (Fig. 1C): split-reads (SR), which capture the MEI insertion point such that part of the
read maps to ME consensus sequence and the other part to the unique flanking reference sequence at the
new genomic location; and paired-end (PE) reads where one read maps to ME consensus and the other to
the unique flanking sequence. In either case, the unique sequence localizes the MEI in the genome.
Existing algorithms based on these principles can detect germline MEIs18, or MEIs carried by a high
subclonal fraction of tumor cells (>25%)2, but require many supporting reads per ME insertion for reliable
detection. Lowering the detection threshold (number of supporting reads) leads to overwhelming numbers
of false positives, likely from experimental noise and alignment errors. For example, using one supporting
read in WGS data at 50ൈ genomic coverage, we should detect ≥50% of MEIs that are present in ≥0.96%
of cells. However, using a standard MEI algorithm ‘RetroSeq’16 to detect calls with one supporting read

Results
Optimization of somatic MEI detection with machine learning
To better distinguish signal from noise in bulk sequencing, we developed RetroSom, which integrates
RetroSeq (for mapping of reads to ME or reference sequence) with a transfer learning model trained on
evolutionarily recent germline MEIs to detect low-level somatic MEIs. We trained RetroSom using
polymorphic germline MEIs selected from Illumina Platinum Genomes WGS data19 for 17 members of a
three-generation pedigree (Fig. 1E and Extended Data Fig. 1B). We assumed that recent germline MEIs
would produce high-confidence non-reference calls that segregate in a Mendelian fashion. We excluded
genomic regions with telomeric or centromeric repeats, segmental duplications, gaps, or near reference
MEI insertions of the same type and on the same strand, totaling 21% of the genome for detection of Alu
or 24% for L1. We also removed regions with abnormal sequencing depth, and supporting reads with low
sequence complexity. We defined true MEIs based on inheritance pattern. Criteria for false MEI calls
(likely artifacts) were <3 supporting reads in offspring and missing in both parents. We detected nonreference true insertions including, on average, 89 L1 and 467 Alu per offspring (Extended Data Fig. 1C).
We then selected differentiating sequence features, ignoring the number of supporting reads (because this
was a selection criteria for true MEIs) and features specific to individual elements (e.g., unique
SNPs/Indels, unlikely to be shared by other families) or to sequencing conditions (to preserve

generalizability) or chromosomal location -- positional bias could be due to natural selection or genetic
drift and thus irrelevant to detecting somatic MEIs20,21. We chose 16-28 differentiating features each for
four supporting-read classes (L1 and Alu PE and SR) (Supplemental Table 3).

We developed a machine learning algorithm using these features to classify true or false L1 or Alu
supporting reads (Extended Data Fig. 1D, E). We tested logistic regression (with and without
regularization), random forest and naïve Bayes classifiers, using 11ൈ cross-validation (training on 10
offspring, testing on the eleventh). The random forest model performed best, with the area under the
precision-recall curve at 0.965 (95% CI: 0.959-0.971) (Extended Data Fig. 1F, G). The most important
differentiating features were sequence homology to the L1Hs or AluY consensus (Fig. 1F), L1Hs-specific
SNPs (Fig. 1G)22, and exclusion of Alu calls with flanking sequence from the putative source location
(“transduction,” which occurs with L1 but not Alu retrotransposition, Fig. 1H)23.

Performance evaluation on three independent datasets
We tested RetroSom in several independent WGS datasets. Data from clonally expanded fetal brain
cells24 confirmed that ≥2 supporting reads are necessary for high precision (L1: 99.97%; Alu: 99.99%)
with adequate sensitivity (L1: 49.5%; Alu: 82.52%) (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Note 1). We also
identified one somatic L1 insertion with features suggesting a rare non-TPRT, endonuclease-independent
process (Supplementary Note 2)25. In addition, Illumina sequencing libraries prepared using a PCR-based
method (~10 cycles) yielded 30-1000% more false MEIs than PCR-free libraries. RetroSom removed all
false MEIs, yielding similar sensitivities between the two library types (L1: ~70%; Alu: ~86%) (Fig. 2B
and Supplementary Note 3).

We further benchmarked RetroSom with a genome mixing experiment. We pooled DNA from 6 human
genomes (after calling high-confidence germline MEIs from available data) in precise proportions of
0.2%-25% with HapMap sample NA12878 (whose germline MEIs are also established); sequenced the

pool (and NA12878 separately as a control) at 200ൈ; and called MEIs with RetroSom. A heterozygous
germline MEI present in one of the six genomes will then occur as a mosaic MEI, with few or no
supporting reads. RetroSom L1 detection sensitivities were 0 at mixing proportions of 0.04% and 0.2%,
0.16 at 1%, 0.67 at 5% and 0.90 at 25%, with no false positives (Fig. 2C, D). Detection rates were higher
for RetroSeq alone (0.32 for 1%) or using RetroSom but requiring only one supporting read (0.48 for 1%),
but with 4316 and 584 false positives, respectively (Fig. 2E). Sequencing depth, when computationally
varied from 50ൈ to 400ൈ, linearly predicted detection sensitivity (especially for low proportions), but not
precision (Fig. 2C-E). RetroSom was more sensitive and less precise for Alu, detecting 5 Alu at 0.2%
mosaicism with 5 false positives (Extended Data Fig. 2C-E). Thus, using 200ൈ WGS data, RetroSom can
detect most mosaic L1 and Alu MEIs at >5% mosaicism, one-sixth with 1% mosaicism, and <1/100 with
<0.2% mosaicism.

Similar performance was observed for detecting Alu insertions (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Discovery and validation of somatic mobile element insertions
To detect real brain somatic MEIs, we separately analyzed neurons and glia (sorted by fluorescenceactivated nuclear sorting) of five adult human postmortem brains: one elderly adult (“A1S”) and two
schizophrenia-control pairs (Dallas Brain Collection)26, and neurons and astrocytes (sorted by immunopanning) from one fetal brain (“F1”) (Supplementary Table 1). We collected superior temporal gyrus
(STG) tissue from adult brains and cortical tissues from fetal brain, and heart or fibroblast control tissue,
and sequenced extracted genomic DNA from each specimen to 200ൈ whole-genome coverage (Fig. 1A,
B). We called somatic MEIs supported with ≥2 high-confidence reads in either brain fraction but none in
the corresponding control. As described above, we again excluded 24% of the genomic sequence from
analysis for L1 and 21% for Alu MEIs. There were 0-3 somatic L1 and 0-13 somatic Alu calls per fraction
(Supplementary Table 4). We selected MEIs for validation by blinded manual inspection with a novel
visualization tool (RetroVis), following a checklist of selection criteria (Extended Data Fig. 5). We
excluded most putative insertions, primarily those with potential mapping errors, and those identified in
the 1000 genome project27 (likely germline insertions) (Supplementary Table 4). Two brain L1 insertions
(L1#1, L1#2), both from the same donor with schizophrenia, met all criteria and were selected for indepth investigation.

We validated both of these insertions following Brain Somatic Mosaicism consortium guidelines28. We
quantitated mosaicism levels using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), and determined the insertion sequences
(single-base resolution) by nested PCR and Sanger sequencing. L1#1 was detected with two high-quality
paired-end supporting reads in neurons, covering the upstream and downstream junctions (Extended Data
Fig. 6A). Estimated mosaicism levels were 0.72% of neurons (95% CI: 0.50-0.94%), 0.54% of glia (95%
CI: 0.40-0.67%) in the discovery region, and 0% in fibroblasts (8 technical replicates, Extended Data Fig.

6B, C). The full insertion sequence demonstrated four hallmarks of in vivo L1 retrotransposition
(Extended Data Fig. 6D-F): (i) The endonuclease cleavage site is 5’-TTTT/CA-3’, similar to the
degenerate consensus motif 5’-TTTT’AA-3’29,30. (ii) Consistent with the common 5’ truncation of new L1
insertions31, L1#1 is a 384bp 3’ fragment of L1 consensus, with a poly(A) tail of ~35bp (Extended Data
Fig. 9E) and a short microhomology at the 5’ genomic DNA/L1 sequence junction, as preferred by 5’truncated L132. (iii) We confirmed a 15-bp target site duplication (TSD), as expected with TPRT
retrotransposition. (iv) L1#1 carries the diagnostic ACA allele at base 5927-5929, the G allele at base
6012, and no other mismatches, indicating that the source element is from the youngest L1Hs-Ta
subfamily (Extended Data Fig. 6D)22.

L1#2 was discovered with three supporting reads, including a split-read spanning the upstream junction
(Extended Data Fig. 7). Estimated mosaicism levels were 1.2% of neurons [95% CI: 1.0-1.4%], 0.53% of
glia [95% CI: 0.46-0.60%]), and 0% in fibroblasts (8 technical replicates, Extended Data Fig. 7B, C). The
endonuclease site is 5’-CTTT/AA-3’, and the sequence contains a 418bp 3’ fragment of the consensus
sequence, a poly(A) tail of ~25bp (Extended Data Fig. 9E) and a 6-bp TSD (Extended Data Fig. 7D).
L1#2 also belongs to the L1Ta subfamily, with one mismatch with consensus sequence (Extended Data
Fig. 7D).

Spatial occurrence of somatic L1 retrotransposition in neurons and glia
Previous studies detected individual L1 insertions in neurons with narrow or broad distributions in one
hemisphere3. Here, we quantitated the levels of L1#1 and L1#2 in neurons and glia from twenty-three
brain regions from symmetrical sites of both hemispheres (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 9A). L1#1 was
detected in neurons of all 23 regions (0.05-2.46% mosaicism), and in glia of 16 regions (0.05-3.46%) (Fig.
3A, C), including the putamen in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, with the average of neurons and
glia maximizing in left occipital cortex distal to STG (neurons, 0.95% (95% CI: 0.8-1.1%); glia, 3.5% (95%
CI: 2.8-4.1%)). L1#2 was absent in specimens from prefrontal cortex, putamen and cerebellum. It was

detected in 11 of 23 regions, all in the cerebral cortex (neurons: 0.1-1.4%; glia: 0.07-1.1%) (Fig. 3B, D),
maximizing in right occipital cortex distal to STG. For both insertions, mosaicism levels were similar in
neurons and glia from the same regions (Spearman ρ=0.77, p=5x10-10) (Extended Data Fig. 9F).

Dysregulation of gene expression by L1 insertion
Both somatic L1 insertions occur in genomic regions of high functional potential. L1#1 is inserted in an
intron of CNNM2 (antisense strand), while L1#2 is in an intron of FRMD4A (sense strand). Specifically,
L1#1 is inserted within a 1639bp putative transcriptional regulatory element ENSR00000032826
(Ensembl v95, Fig. 4A) that is defined by histone modification markers (Supplemental Table 6)33, in a
broad linkage disequilibrium region surrounding AS3MT and CNNM2 where genome-wide significant
evidence for association was reported for schizophrenia9 and other traits (Fig. 4A, Extended Data Fig. 8,
and Supplemental Table 7)34.

CNNM2 and FRMD4A are expressed in many tissues, with higher levels in brain 35,36. Tissue culture
studies show that intronic L1 insertions, on either strand, can alter or disrupt gene expression, e.g., by
inhibiting transcription elongation, altering splicing, terminating transcription prematurely or modifying
local chromatin structure37. The effect depends on insertion length, strand, and splicing or
polyadenylation sites within the insertion. Here we obtained the first experimental data showing the
effects on gene expression of mosaic L1 insertions discovered in primary human brain cells.

L1#1 is inserted in a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block, based on the common SNPs that are highly correlated (R2 > 0.6) with the
closest common SNP to L1#1, rs1890185 (398bp upstream of L1#1). This LD block (gray) contains 72 SNPs significantly
associated with 10 diseases or disorders and 28 measurement or other traits, including 13 risk SNPs from 11 schizophrenia
studies34. Red, SNPs associated with schizophrenia; blue, SNPs associated with other neurological disorders; black, SNPs
associated with other traits.

Using a green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter “Gint”40, we tested the effects of L1#1 and L1#2 on
gene expression by cloning each one (with flanking sequence) into a constitutively spliced intron in the
antisense or sense strand respectively of the EGFP locus (Fig. 4B and Extended Data Fig. 9B). Control
reporters were generated for the two flanking sequences without L1 insertion, with red fluorescent protein
(RFP) reporter ‘Rint’ as an internal control40. In a blinded experiment, we transfected each of the
modified Gint reporters with Rint control into HeLa cells and measured the level of fluorescence (Fig.
4C-F). Compared to controls, L1#1 (antisense) reduced green fluorescence by 28% (95% CI: 20-35%, t=6.2, adjusted p=8x10-9), and L1#2 (sense) reduced green fluorescence by 39% (95% CI: 33-45%, t=-9.6,
adjusted p=6x10-20) (Fig. 4C). Including the intronic length as a covariate, the difference in fluorescence
remains significantly correlated for insertion vs. control assay (t=-9.27, adjusted p=4x10-19). There was
also a modestly significant difference in reductions of green fluorescence for L1#1 vs. L1#2 insertions
(t=-4.12, adjusted p=3x10-4), possibly due to a weak polyadenylation signal in the L1#2 sense strand (but
not the truncated L1#1 sequence) that could terminate transcription prematurely37. The red fluorescence
was generally consistent across all assays, except for a slight increase in assay L1#2 (t=2.4, adjusted
p=0.2), possibly due to weaker competition from EGFP synthesis in the same cells (Fig. 4D). We
confirmed similar results in a separate experiment with no Rint control (Extended Data Fig. 9C, D). These
in vitro results suggest that L1#1 and L1#2 could, in principle, reduce expression of genes into which they
are inserted.

Discussion
We demonstrate that each of the two somatic MEIs that we characterized in greater detail has similar
mosaicism levels and anatomical distributions for glia and neurons. Thus glia, which are at least equal in
numbers to neurons amongst the cells of the human brain, are similarly important targets for research on
the physiological impact of somatic retrotransposition and the tracing of developmental lineages. The
distributions of the two validated L1 insertions in both neurons and glia (but not fibroblasts) indicate that
the retrotransposition likely occurred in neuroepithelial cells at the neural plate stage: before the
separation of cerebellum, basal ganglia and cortex for L1#1, and later in a dorsal telencephalic
neuroepithelial cell for L1#2. Both neuroepithelial cells would give rise to bipotential neural stem cells
(the radial glia)41, that develop into neurons and glia and serve as a guiding scaffold for their migration
from the developing ventricular zones to the cortical surface. Thus L1#1 and L1#2 both have similar
mosaicism levels in neurons and glia from the same anatomical region, with the earlier mutation event
(L1#1) producing higher mosaicism levels.

Widely divergent estimates of the rate of somatic L1 insertions in brain have been reported. Two previous
unsorted bulk sequencing studies described hundreds of putative somatic L1 insertions at 80ൈ coverage
using Complete Genomics sequencing12 or thousands per region at 30ൈ coverage using targeted Illumina
sequencing5. Our mixing experiment results suggest that sequencing at these depths would only detect
insertions with higher mosaicism levels than were observed here: our sensitivity to detect mosaicism
levels >5% was 0.67, and none were observed, suggesting that such events are rare. Our data are more
consistent with careful analyses of single-cell data, with extensive computational filtering and
experimental validation, which estimated <0.2 L1 retrotransposition events/neuron3,6,8,13. RetroSom's
sensitivity is ~0.16 for insertions at 1% mosaicism (Fig. 2C), but it masks 24% of the genome as
unreliable for detection. Assuming new L1 retrotransposition occurs at a similar rate in highly repetitive
regions and in reference genomic L1s21,42, average sensitivity is therefore reduced to ~0.12, thus ~1/8th of

MEIs at 1% mosaicism are detected. We validated two somatic L1s from the brain selected for extensive
characterization, at 0.72-1.2% mosaicism at the discovery site, which should therefore contain 8 x 2 = 16
somatic L1 insertions at ~1% mosaicism levels. Thus, sampling single cells in this region would yield
on average 0.16 somatic L1 insertions per cell, similar to the previous single-cell estimates.

Future developments in WGS will accelerate this area of research. Using even deeper WGS coverage will
allow for detection of very low (<<1%) mosaicism levels, e.g., in fetal brain tissues where full clonal
expansion has not occurred, or after sorting for highly differentiated cells with limited further expansion,
or regions where mosaicism level is modified by the degree of tangential migration and
neurodevelopmental programmed cell death43. Accurate and cost-effective long-read WGS technologies
will emerge and allow to improve somatic MEI detection in repetitive sequences, and longer reads or
longer paired-end insert sizes will permit detecting mosaic L1s carrying 5’ or 3’ sequences from the
source region (transduction)23. The precision of our modeling strategy is constant with higher depth and
read length, while sensitivity will improve.

Can moderate or low levels of mosaicism have pathological consequences? Known disease-associated
MEIs are germline mutations44. In human brain, somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with low
tissue allele frequencies (tAF, the fraction of chromosomes carrying an alternative allele) in known risk
genes can drive functional anomalies28, such as Sturge-Weber syndrome (1-18% tAF)45, focal cortical
dysplasia (1.3-12%)46, and hemimegalencephaly (8-40% tAF)47,48. Our observation of somatic MEIs in
0.05-3.46% of brain cells in multiple regions translates to 0.025-1.73% tAF. Regarding whether such
levels can be pathological, e.g., in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, one can consider a
hypothetical scenario of an etiologically-relevant anatomical region where 3% of cells carry functionally
damaging MEIs, i.e., acting as somatic additional genetic hits, potentially in an individual with a genomic
background that already confers elevated polygenic disease risk. Taking our findings as examples, L1#1
disrupted CNNM2, in which common SNPs are strongly associated with schizophrenia (Fig. 4A)9 and

which is likely a driver gene10; while L1#2 disrupted FRMD4A, associated with a syndrome of
microcephaly and intellectual disability11, phenotypes observed in carriers of copy number variants that
increase risk of schizophrenia49. Both genes are expressed in brain and both MEIs reduced gene
expression in an experimental assay. L1#1 also disrupted a putative transcriptional regulatory element
with predicted effects on multiple neighboring genes50, which could lead to rewiring of transcription
networks.

These observations in one patient do not establish an etiological role. However, it is likely that each
patient with a common genetically complex disease has a unique set of common variants with small
effects on risk, and rare variants with larger effects9. The latter could include mosaic MEIs with strong
local effects that extend beyond the mutated cells and thus are less dependent on mosaicism levels, such
as disordered neurodevelopment, induction of epileptiform activity, disruption of brain circuit activity
through the large numbers of synaptic connections of the mutated cells, or cell-cell contacts during
epithelial cell polarization (e.g., the essential role played by FRMD4A in the cell adhesion protein
complex)51. In diseases like schizophrenia or autism with greatly reduced fecundity, large-effect de novo
mutations in germline and soma may play a role in maintaining disease frequency52. Thus, it is worth
keeping an open mind about the potential pathological consequences of even low mosaic levels of
somatic MEIs in neuropsychiatric disorders. Finally, while high-frequency somatic MEIs are described in
human cancers2, lower-frequency somatic mutations can also be clinically significant, due to tumor
impurity and subclonality53. RetroSom could be applied to investigate the full frequency spectrum and
clonal architecture of MEI mosaicism in tumors, as well as other disease states where somatic
retrotransposition is expected to play a role.
