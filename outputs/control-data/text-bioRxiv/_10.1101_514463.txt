Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell repertoires are made up of a vast number of phenotypically distinct subsets
with different functional properties. The molecular programs involved in maintaining NK cell
repertoire diversity under homeostatic conditions remains elusive. Here we show that subsetspecific NK cell proliferation kinetics correlate with mTOR activation, and that global repertoire
diversity is maintained through a high degree of intra-lineage subset plasticity during IL-15-driven
homeostatic proliferation in vitro. High-resolution flow cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing
revealed that slowly cycling sorted KIR+CD56dim NK cells with an induced CD57 phenotype
display increased functional potential associated with inhibitory MHC interactions and activating
DAP12 signaling. In contrast, rapidly cycling cells upregulate NKG2A and display a general loss
of functionality associated with a transcriptional increase in RNA-binding metabolic enzymes and
cytokine signaling pathways. These results shed new light on the role of intra-lineage plasticity
during NK cell homeostasis and suggest that the functional fate of the cell is tightly linked to the
acquired phenotype and determined by transcriptional reprogramming.

Introduction
Since their discovery in the early 1970s, our view of natural killer (NK) cells has developed from
a uniform and short-lived cell population to a group of effectors vastly diverse in terms of
phenotype, functionality and life span1. Mapping of NK cell subset diversity at the single cell level
by mass cytometry revealed that there are more than 105 unique NK cell subsets in the adult
human2. Much of this diversity results from stochastic expression of killer cell immunoglobulinlike receptors (KIR), but several other heterogeneously expressed activating and inhibitory
receptors contribute to the intra and inter-donor diversity of the NK cell repertoire3.
The extreme ends of the NK cell differentiation spectrum are well defined, the naïve end
consisting of CD56bright NK cells and the mature, terminally differentiated end consisting of
CD56dim adaptive, memory-like NK cells4–6. CD56bright NK cells are highly responsive to cytokine
stimulation and have an immunoregulatory role, while CD56dim NK cells favor receptor ligation
input with their function being geared towards cytotoxicity7. The CD56dim NK cell subset exhibits
large variation in both functionality and phenotype, which can be placed on a spectrum of
maturation defined by the expression of key HLA class I binding receptors NKG2A and KIR, as
well as CD57, a marker of terminal differentiation8. The inhibitory NKG2A receptor is expressed
on CD56bright and immature CD56dim NK cells, which can further differentiate by acquiring KIR
expression, losing NKG2A expression and acquiring CD578. This, however, is not a strict
maturation scheme, as any combination of the above receptors can exist. Nevertheless,
phenotyping based on these receptors has served as a useful tool for grouping NK cells based on
their functional, metabolic and proliferative ability, as well as their longevity7,9. Mouse studies
identified critical roles for T-bet and Eomes in the transition from CD27b+CD11b- to CD27CD11b+ cells, but the intracellular signaling pathways leading to activation of these transcription
factors are still not understood10,11. Collin et al., described transcriptional differences between three

functional distinct human NK cell subsets (CD56bright, CD57-CD56dim, CD57+CD56dim) and
identified subset specific transcriptional regulators which were shared with the T cell lineage and
thus evolutionarily conserved12. However, the molecular programs involved in maintaining NK
cell repertoire diversity under homeostatic conditions remains elusive.
IL-15 has been identified as the main player in maintaining NK cell homeostasis due to its vital
role in survival, development and proliferation11,13,14. Immune cells and other non-hematopoietic
cells can trans-present IL-15 on the IL-15Rα chain, binding to the IL-15Rβ and the common γchain found expressed on the surface of NK cells. The IL-15 complex signals via JAK1/3
activating the transcription factor STAT5. However, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
can also be activated via IL-15 signaling in a dose-dependent manner15. This serine/threonine
kinase can form two protein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which senses nutrients
such as glucose and amino acids in the microenvironment, and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2),
which aids in controlling the cytoskeletal organization in the cell16. Due to its nutrient sensing
ability, mTORC1 controls NK cell metabolism and modifies it accordingly in a process termed
metabolic reprogramming. In murine NK cells, mTORC1 activation mediated increased effector
function via Granzyme B and IFNγ production by shifting from predominantly oxidative
phosphorylation to glycolysis16–19. Although mTORC2 has been shown to be sustained by IL-15
induced mTORC1 activation, mTORC2 activation results in a negative feedback loop suppressing
mTORC1 induced effector functions by reducing SLC7A5 expression in mice20. In humans, the
role of mTOR in maintaining homeostasis and as a master regulator for proliferation, education
and effector function still needs further investigation.
In humans, the diverse and unique NK cell pool within individuals is well-maintained over
time21. This stability in receptor repertoires combined with the rapid turnover of NK cells22 hints
at the important role proliferation plays in replenishing the NK cell pool at steady state. The

question arises if this observed stability during homeostatic proliferation is the result of selfrenewal from an immature pool of progenitor cells followed by differentiation or arises due to
plasticity within the NK cell subsets.
Intra-lineage cell plasticity, also known as functional plasticity, is the term describing
phenotypic and functional changes occurring within a given cell lineage23. Functional plasticity is
an adaptation of the immune system to its surroundings, for examples transition between M1 and
M2 phenotypes in macrophages, transition between ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 or transition between
CD4 T helper cells and induced T regulatory cells. Functional plasticity is the result of cytokine
or receptor input and is translated into transcriptional changes resulting in modified functionality24.
NK cell plasticity has largely been unexplored, with the exception of TGFb-induced NK cell
conversion into intermediate ILC1-like cells25.
In this study, we show that NK cell repertoire diversity is maintained during IL-15-driven
homeostatic proliferation through a combination of mTOR-dependent hierarchy in proliferation
capacity and a substantial degree of intra-lineage plasticity. Subset plasticity at the phenotypic
level is tightly linked to the functional fate of the cell and associated with upregulation of distinct
transcriptional programs that define the acquired phenotype. These results provide new insights
into the cellular and molecular programs involved in regulating NK cell homeostasis at the single
cell level.

Results
Subset specific proliferation kinetics
We set out to study the cellular and molecular events associated with the shift from a quiescent to
a proliferative state during homeostatic proliferation in NK cells. To this end we stimulated
purified primary human NK cells with 5ng/mL of IL-15 daily, monitored the onset of proliferation
and tracked subsequent cell divisions using a proliferation dye. At the population level, cell
division began on day 3 and followed a linear path, with roughly one cell division per day (Fig.
1A-B). Slight variation between donors in terms of proliferation and subset distribution was
observed (fig. S1). We have previously identified a hierarchy in the proliferative response
determined by NK cell differentiation defined through expression patterns of NKG2A, KIR and
CD578. Therefore, we stratified the analysis of NK cell proliferation kinetics according to
differentiation status into 8 distinct subsets based on the expression of NKG2A, KIR and CD57.
CD57 expression had the strongest impact on proliferation speed, resulting in a slightly delayed
onset, slower subsequent cell divisions and a low proliferation index (Fig. 1C-D). Notably,
NKG2A-KIR+ NK cells proliferated more slowly than NKG2A-KIR- NK cells, independent of
CD57 expression (Fig. 1C-D). Importantly, however, irrespective of subset-specific differences in
proliferation kinetics, the global NK cell repertoires remained largely stable during the one-week
time frame in this experimental set up (Fig. 1E). Thus, this in vitro model allowed us to tease apart
subset-specific behavior under conditions that mimic natural NK cell repertoire homeostasis.

mTOR activation determines proliferation kinetics
Given that mTOR has been implicated in NK cell proliferation15, we first examined the relationship
between mTOR activation and proliferation kinetics. A downstream target of mTORC1 is the

ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) which becomes phosphorylated upon mTORC1 activation15. We
observed an increase in pS6 expression with each additional cell division when comparing
different generations in actively cycling cells (day 5) (Fig. 2A-B). Inhibiting mTORC1 in
proliferating cells resulted in a decrease in both pS6 and Ki-67 MFI (fig. S2A-B). When looking
at the fold change in pS6 expression in bulk NK cells across different days, we observed donor
specific upregulation prior to any cell division taking place (day 2) (Fig. 2C). The fold change in
pS6 correlated positively with the number of cells having divided on day 3 and followed a similar
trend for days 4-5 (Fig. 2C). Early pS6 upregulation was a predictive marker for NK cell
proliferation potential in individual donors, as the fold change on day 2 correlated with the percent
of cells having divided on day 5 (Fig. 2D).
Next, we sampled the same six individuals monthly over a three-month period. We observed
a large variation in pS6 fold change in response to IL-15 stimulation among subsets (Fig. 2E).
These results prompted us to dissect the role of subset distribution in determining proliferation
kinetics at the donor level, focusing on NKG2A+KIR-CD57- and NKG2A-KIR-CD57+. The
percentage of NKG2A+KIR-CD57- and NKG2A-KIR-CD57+ cells at baseline correlated positively
or negatively, respectively, with the fold change in pS6 for the total NK cell population on day 2
(Fig. 2F). Notably, subset distribution at baseline and pS6 fold change on day 2 were both stable
within individuals over time, illustrated by the clustering of serial data-points originating from the
same individual (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, baseline percentages of NKG2A+KIR-CD57- and NKG2AKIR-CD57+ cells correlated positively or negatively, respectively, with the degree of proliferation
observed for the total NK cell population on day 5 (Fig. 2G). Hence, the subset distribution in a
given donor correlated with overall pS6 upregulation in that same donor, which in turn correlated
with the degree of proliferation at the population level.

A large inter-donor variation in pS6 upregulation was also noted within the NKG2A+KIRCD57- subset, which exhibited the highest fold change in pS6 expression (Fig 2E). Intriguingly,
the fold change in pS6 upregulation in the NKG2A+KIR-CD57- subset prior to proliferation (day
2) correlated positively with subsequent proliferation of all NK cells in that donor (day 5) (Fig.
2H). Therefore, the donor variation in proliferative capacity at a global level is determined in part
by the subset composition at baseline and in part by a donor-dependent metabolic set point
determining the level of mTOR activation in response to IL-15 stimulation.

IL-15-induced intra-lineage plasticity
Despite distinct differences in proliferation kinetics and pS6 upregulation between NK cell subsets
(Fig. 1D, 2E), the subset frequencies were largely retained at the population level (Fig. 1E), which
led us to investigate if transitioning between NK cell phenotypes occurred during IL-15-induced
proliferation. To investigate the potential role of intra-lineage plasticity, we sorted three NK cell
subsets with distinct differentiation status (NKG2A+KIR-CD57-, NKG2A-KIR+CD57-, NKG2AKIR-CD57+) prior to induction of proliferation and monitored the individual cultures for
phenotypic diversity after 6 days of IL-15 stimulation (Fig. 3A). Phenotypic stratification of the
sorted subsets on day 6 showed a remarkable amount of plasticity, particularly in the NKG2AKIR+CD57- subset, with the most common phenotypic changes being acquisition of NKG2A or
CD57 (Fig. 3B). Acquisition of KIR2DL1 or KIR2DL3 expression was less frequent and only
occurred in a low percentage of the cells (Fig. 3B).
To determine if the observed plasticity was dependent on the degree of proliferation, we used
tSNE analysis to visualize the phenotypic consequences of IL-15 driven plasticity at the generation
level (fig. S3). The population map, based on the expression of phenotypic and functional markers,
showed a clear distinction between slowly (Generation 0-1) and rapidly cycling (Generation 2+)

cells (fig. S3). Applying this stratification based on proliferation kinetics to the NKG2AKIR+CD57- sorted cells, highlighted the impact proliferation kinetics have on the acquired
phenotype. High proliferation rate was associated with NKG2A expression while slow
proliferation rate was associated with CD57 expression, both within an individual subset (Fig. 3C)
and at the population level (fig. S3). Although proliferation impacted the acquired phenotype, the
overall degree of plasticity was independent of proliferation, as the size of the original phenotypic
subset (NKG2A-KIR+CD57-) was similar in both groups on day 6 (Fig. 3C).
Thus, IL-15-induced plasticity was evident in NK cells across the differentiation spectrum and
contributed to the maintenance of repertoire diversity at the population level.

The acquired phenotype determines functional responses
NK cell differentiation is associated with changes in functional potential9. Therefore, we posed the
question of whether acquisition of the differentiation markers could modify the cell’s functional
capabilities. Acquisition of NKG2A expression in sorted NKG2A-KIR+CD57- cells resulted in a
significantly higher expansion index (Fig. 4A). Conversely, cells that acquired CD57 showed
increased ability to degranulate and produce cytokines in response to target cell stimulation (Fig.
4B-C). In line with the functional dichotomy observed in NK cells with induced phenotypes,
FACS-sorted slowly cycling cells, exhibiting a higher proportion of CD57+ cells, displayed higher
killing capacity compared to rapidly cycling, predominantly NKG2A+ NK cells (Fig. 4D-E).
In NK cells, the functional potential is tuned by a processed termed education, where
interactions between self-MHC class I ligands and inhibitory receptors are translated into increased
effector potential7. As functionality was decreased in rapidly cycling NK cells, we wanted to
investigate the KIR repertoire during proliferation and examine whether education was inherited
in the progeny. t-SNE analysis of the three major inhibitory KIR receptors revealed a narrowing

of the KIR repertoire in rapidly cycling cells that mainly expressed one single KIR, while slowly
cycling cells were more likely to express multiple KIRs per cell (fig. S4A-B). The education status,
determined by the level of degranulation in self and non-self KIR+ NK cells in response to target
cell stimulation, was inherited in rapidly cycling cells albeit less pronounced compared to slowly
cycling cells (Fig. 4F).
These data demonstrate that the loss of functionality observed in rapidly cycling NK cells was
mainly related to the induced naïve NKG2A+ phenotype compared to the induced mature CD57+
phenotype in slowly cycling cells. Hence, the cell’s acquired phenotype, and not its origin,
determined its functional capabilities in terms of cytotoxicity and proliferation.

IL-15 induced transcriptional reprogramming
In order to identify the transcriptional programs associated with the observed phenotypic and
functional plasticity we performed single-cell RNA sequencing using sorted NKG2AselfKIR+CD57- NK cells. The cells were cultured with IL-15 for 6 days to allow for plasticity and
proliferation to occur, followed by further FACS sorting into slowly and rapidly cycling cells (fig.
S5). Additionally, two subsets (NKG2A+KIR-CD57- and NKG2A-selfKIR+CD57+) were sorted
and sequenced at baseline to identify defining transcriptional signatures of these functionally
diverse subsets (fig. S5).
To exclude that the differences in proliferation kinetics were due to differential expression of
genes involved in cell cycle progression, we clustered all 7556 cells on the expression of 158 cell
cycle checkpoint genes and 94 cell cycle genes in our day 6 dataset. Given that the majority of the
cells were actively proliferating, t-SNE clustering of NK cells was heavily biased towards cell
cycle phase (Fig. 5A). Notably, we found no differences in expression of these cell cycle related
genes or checkpoints between slowly and rapidly cycling cells, which were equally distributed in

all phases of the cell cycle (fig. S6A-B). As a control, the same set of genes clearly clustered with
the stage of the cell cycle (fig. S6A-B). By comparing clusters that differed in cycling speed, but
not in cell cycle phase, we could extract differentially expressed genes (DEG) and omit the
influence of cell cycle genes. Consequently, we identified 209 DEGs between cluster 2 and 3 (G1
phase) and 617 DEGs between cluster 6 and 8 (G2/M phase), with 130 of these genes being
differentially expressed in both phases (Fig. 5B). When the 130 genes were ordered based on the
degree of differential expression within each cell cycle phase, we observed a complete overlap in
the order of the genes regardless of cell cycle phase analyzed (Fig. 5C).

To address whether the IL-15 induced subset plasticity was associated with transcriptional
reprogramming we first identified genes that were differentially expressed between mature
NKG2A-selfKIR+CD57+ and naïve NKG2A+KIR-CD57- NK cells at baseline. Single-cell RNA
sequencing revealed 295 DEGs between clusters most clearly representing the NKG2A+KIRCD57- and the NKG2A-selfKIR+CD57+ subset (Fig. 5D and fig. S6C). Next, we compared the 130
DEG of the induced subsets (day 6) with the 295 DEG between the corresponding subsets at
baseline and identified 51 overlapping genes (Fig. 5E). Of these 51 differentially expressed genes,
38 were upregulated in slowly cycling cells and only 13 in rapidly cycling cells (Fig. 5F). 84% of
the slowly cycling gene signature was shared with the mature NKG2A-selfKIR+CD57+ signature
at baseline, while 54% of the rapidly cycling gene signature was shared with the naïve
NKG2A+KIR-CD57- signature at baseline (Fig. 5F). Hence, IL-15-driven intra-lineage plasticity
and the associated shift in functional responses was associated with transcriptional reprogramming
towards the baseline signature of NK cells with the acquired phenotype.

Cytokine- versus receptor-driven biological programs
Although the functional potential of NK cells at different differentiation stages is well documented,
the transcriptional signatures mediating these functionalities are not as well defined. Pathway
analysis of the 130 DEGs showed a clear difference in potential upstream regulators between
slowly and rapidly cycling cells (Table 1). Upstream regulators of rapidly cycling cells included
cytokines (IL-15, IL-18), transcription regulators (MYC, HIF1A, STAT5A, JUN), stimulatory
agents (PMA, ionomycin), as well as activation induced kinases (AKT1) and complexes (NFkB).
Conversely, upstream regulators of slowly cycling cells included an array of inhibitory molecules
(cyclosporin A, sirolimus, wortmannin, prostaglandin E2, PD98059, trichostatin A) and cytokines
(IL-6, IL-27). Intriguingly sirolimus, better known as rapamycin, is a potent inhibitor of mTORC1,
which we have identified as the main determinant of IL-15 induced proliferation. Furthermore, a
number of the upstream regulators of rapidly cycling cells are associated with mTOR signaling,
including mTOR phosphorylation via AKT127.
We applied Gene Ontology’s gene over-representation analysis, looking at molecular
function, biological processes and pathways significantly different between slowly and rapidly
cycling cells (Fig. 6). The common theme for slowly cycling cells was receptor-based interactions
leading to increased cytotoxicity, as shown by antigen presentation, DAP12 signaling, IFN
signaling, calcium homeostasis and the endosome/vacuolar pathway. Genes that highly
contributed to these pathways were the MHC class I molecules (HLA-A/B/C/E/F), while B2M and
CD16 (FCGR3A) also moderately contributed. In contrast, rapidly cycling cells were associated
with increased cytokine activity and signaling as well as increased metabolic activity (glycolysis,
gluconeogenesis).
Our findings revealed stark differences in the molecular signature of slowly and rapidly
cycling cells, hinting at increased metabolism and activation leading to cytokine dependence in

rapidly cycling cells. Slowly cycling cells, on the contrary, acquired transcriptional signatures of
mature NK cells with a focus on receptor-based interactions, potentially explaining the increased
functionality upon target cell interactions.

Discussion
IL-15 is a key homeostatic cytokine for NK cells and has been linked to vital processes including
survival, differentiation, functionality and proliferation14,15,17,28–30. However, it remains elusive
how these processes come together at the population level to maintain stable and yet highly
diversified subset repertoires within individuals. We developed an in vitro model to study
functional consequences and transcriptional programs involved in IL-15 driven homeostasis and
subset plasticity at the single cell and repertoire level. We noted a striking mTOR-dependent
hierarchy in proliferative responses among discrete NK cell subsets. Yet, despite profound subsetspecific differences in proliferation kinetics, the global repertoires remained relatively stable
suggesting that proliferation differences between subsets could be balanced by plasticity.
Intra-lineage plasticity, defined as phenotypic and functional changes occurring within a given
cell lineage,23 remains largely understudied in the context of NK cells. Most studies published so
far have examined dynamic phenotypic changes in the NK cell repertoire in a tumor setting, either
using mouse models or stimulation with tumor cell lines25,31. Herein, we observed a high degree
of NK cell plasticity across the differentiation spectrum in response to IL-15 stimulation. We
focused our analysis on NKG2A-KIR+CD57- NK cells, a subset at an intermediate stage of
differentiation, and followed their fate after FACS sorting and subsequent IL-15-induced
proliferation. At the phenotypic level, we noted a high degree of plasticity with the dominant
induced phenotypes being cells that retained KIR expression and acquired either NKG2A or CD57
expression. These two major phenotypes were linked to different functional fates, with induced
NKG2A+KIR+CD57- NK cells displaying strong proliferative responses, whereas induced
NKG2A-KIR+CD57+ NK cells exhibited increased responsiveness to target cell stimulation.
To date, studies looking at homeostatic proliferation have largely been carried out in
lymphopenic mice with a focus on T cell proliferation54–56. Spontaneous proliferation occurred in

severely lymphopenic mice, hallmarked by rapid cell division (<24h) without the need for cytokine
stimulation, resulting in an acquired memory phenotype, diversification of the T cell receptor
repertoire and cytokine production upon stimulation. Homeostatic proliferation, on the other hand,
was observed in mildly lymphopenic hosts and at a slower division rate, with proliferation
requiring both TCR interaction and cytokine stimulation (IL-7). Target cell lysis by CD8+ T cells
was only observed by day 12 post transfer, highlighting a functional inability during the initial
phase of proliferation. Most importantly, once the proliferation cues were removed, the
proliferating cells reverted back to their initial phenotype whereas this reversal was not observed
in RAG-/- hosts due to continued proliferation55. These studies bear striking similarity with the
functional dichotomy between rapid and slowly cycling NK cells and it would be interesting to
determine if rapidly cycling cells could regain functionality in the absence of proliferation cues.
To address whether the phenotypic and functional shift observed in our in vitro model was
associated with transcriptional reprogramming, we projected the differentially expressed genes in
cells with the induced phenotypes onto baseline transcriptional signatures of naïve and
differentiated NK cells. Since we did not sort NKG2A+KIR+CD57- at baseline, the induced
NKG2A+KIR+CD57- phenotype in rapidly cycling cells had to be related to transcriptional
signature of the more naïve NKG2A+KIR-CD57- cells. Slowly cycling cells had a transcriptional
signature that overlapped to a great degree with more differentiated NKG2A-selfKIR+CD57+ cells
at baseline. Although rapidly cycling cells showed increased expression of genes defining naïve
NKG2A+KIR-CD57- cells, they also exhibited increased expression of genes associated with more
mature cells, such as GZMB, likely reflecting an IL-15 primed state. Altogether, these results
suggested that IL-15 induced intra-lineage plasticity was associated with transcriptional and
functional reprogramming, resulting in two functionally diverse NK cell populations.

One of the key regulatory mechanisms behind immune cell differentiation and function is
metabolism, at the center of which lies mTOR32. mTOR controls an important checkpoint for both
activation and differentiation in NK cells, but the exact signaling cascade upstream and
downstream of mTOR mediating this effect is unknown16,20,30,33–35. Studies in mice have identified
a threshold of IL-15 stimulation which needs to be surpassed for mTORC1 activation to occur,
while suboptimal stimulation resulted in STAT5 activation only. Similarly, we observed a large
variation in mTORC1 activity, both at the donor level but more intriguingly at the subset level
where the level of activation correlated with and could predict the subsequent degree of
proliferation. Naïve NKG2A expressing cells are highly responsive to cytokine stimulation36. In
line with this notion, rapidly cycling NKG2A+ NK cells exhibited the highest fold change in pS6
expression, suggesting that they reached the threshold needed for mTORC1 activation. Hence,
mTOR activation may play a role in inducing the naïve NKG2A+KIR+CD57- phenotype in
cytokine responsive, rapidly cycling cells. In contrast, sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor37, was one of
the top upstream regulators of the gene program associated with the induced mature NKG2AKIR+CD57+ phenotype. These data suggest that the mTOR pathway is most important during early
differentiation whereas terminal differentiation may be regulated by other IL-15 induced
pathways.
Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a prominent IL-15-driven metabolic reprogramming in
rapidly cycling cells, with significantly increased expression of glycolytic enzymes including
PGK1, ENO1, PGAM1, ALDOA, GAPDH, GPI, LDHA and PKM. These signatures match the
IL-15 induced metabolic reprogramming observed in mouse studies which are dependent on
mTOR activation15–17. Metabolic reprogramming is necessary to meet the energetic and
biosynthetic needs of proliferating cells. Stimulation induced aerobic glycolysis allows for
increased glycolytic flux combined with increased rates of biosynthesis38. Recently a new

functional role for selected metabolic enzymes has been described, namely regulating transcription
and translation by translocating to the nucleus and binding to RNA and DNA39–41. Included in this
group are GAPDH, ENO1, PKM, LDHA and GPI. In T cells, during high glycolytic flux, GAPDH
has been shown to induce translation of IFNg and IL-2 while it’s interaction with Rheb is inhibited,
releasing Rheb to activate mTORC140,42. Similarly, PKM2, one of two transcripts of PKM, can
activate mTORC1 by phosphorylating another inhibitor AKT1S1, which could account for
increased mTORC1 activation in rapidly cycling cells43. GPI, yet another glycolytic enzyme, has
been shown to promote growth, increase motility of fibroblasts in a tumor setting, and can be
inhibited by the insulin growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3)40. Although IGFBP3 was not
differentially expressed in our dataset, slowly cycling cells did have significantly increased
IGFBP7 expression as well as decreased GPI expression. Furthermore, de Rosa et al have
identified an important role for enolase-1 (ENO1) in transforming highly metabolically active and
proliferating conventional T cells into iTreg cells44. This complete reversal of function of the T
cell was mediated by ENO1 translocating to the nucleus. Evidently, activation induced metabolic
reprogramming in rapidly cycling cells could account for the functional differences we observe in
this population.
Rapidly cycling cells also exhibited increased expression of genes associated with actin
filament organization45. These genes included COTL1, CAPG, ALDOA, TMSB10, VIM, and
VASP, where COTL1 and CAPG are two of the most highly differentially expressed genes (data
not shown). Considering the role actin plays in immune synapse formation, conjugate formation
and the transportation of cytotoxic granules to the surface46, modified actin polymerization during
intense proliferation could result in a number of effects that impact target cell responsiveness.
Although IL-15 stimulation induced granzyme B production in a proliferation dependent manner,
this did not translate into increased target cell killing. COTL1 and CAPG are genes normally only

expressed in bright NK cells (data not shown), which similar to the rapidly cycling cells studied
here, are highly responsive to cytokine input, have a high proliferative capacity and reduced
cytotoxic potential. Hence, further studies looking at the role of actin organization and immune
synapse formation in rapidly cycling cells is warranted. It will be important to delineate the
mechanisms that allow the cell to switch from a proliferative mode to a cytotoxic and targetseeking mode.
The gene signature contributing to the pathway analysis in slowly cycling cells was dominated
by MHC class I molecules (HLA-A/B/C/E/F), B2M and FCGR3A expression. This is in line with
the flow cytometry data, as the more differentiated slowly cycling cells commonly expressed
multiple KIRs per cell. Although HLA-KIR interactions normally occur in trans, cis interactions
have been observed in mice47,48. Ly49 receptors have a flexible stalk, which KIR do not, allowing
for a cis interaction to take place49. Nonetheless, HLA-LILR cis interactions have been shown in
humans and therefore cis HLA-KIR interactions cannot be excluded50,51. In mice, higher
expression of MHC on the NK cells’ surface led to increased MHC-Ly49 binding, effectively
restricting the number of Ly49 molecules available to interact with potential target cells, and thus
lowering the activation threshold required47,52,53. We found that the increased inhibitory
interactions combined with FCGR3A expression was associated with increased cytotoxicity in
slowly cycling cells. Similarly, a lack of inhibitory signaling observed in rapidly cycling cells due
to limited HLA-E expression could turn the cells hyporesponsive. Intriguingly, while MHC class
I molecules were increased in slowly cycling cells, two MHC class II molecules were increased in
rapidly cycling cells, namely HLA-DRB131 and HLA-DQB1, potentially indicating an activation
signature due to cytokine responsiveness.
Our results provide new insights into how, during homeostasis, intra-lineage plasticity in
response to IL-15 effectively maintains phenotypically and functionally diverse NK cell

conditions of perturbed homeostasis, such as during infection or post stem-cell transplantation,
will further our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the diversification and differentiation

Materials and Methods
Cell processing and proliferation protocol
Using density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Hypaque; GE Healthcare), peripheral mononuclear
cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy blood donors obtained from the Karolinska University
Hospital or Oslo University Hospital Blood bank (dnr: 2016/1415-32). NK cells were further
isolated using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) (NK cell isolation kit; Miltenyi Biotech)
and labeled with 1μM cell proliferation dye CellTrace Violet (CTV; Life Technologies) or
Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Life Technologies). The labeled NK cells were
resuspended in Stem Cell Growth Medium (SCGM; CellGenix) supplemented with 10% human
serum (Sigma), 2mM L-glutamine (GE Healthcare) and 5ng/mL IL-15 (R&D) at 1,5x106 cells/mL
and cultured in 96 U-bottom wells in a final volume of 200μL at 37°C and 5% CO2. IL-15 was
replenished daily and 100μL of medium was replaced with fresh medium on day 3 of culture.
Visualization plots for proliferation (Fig. 1B-C, E) and plasticity (Fig. 3B) were created using
RAW Graphs57.

Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested and stained in 96 V-bottom plates using the following fluorochrome
conjugated antibodies (clone names in brackets): CD107a-AF700 or PE-Cy5 (H4A3), CD14-V500
(MφP9), CD19-V500 (HIB19), CD3-V500 (UCHT1), CD57-BV605 (NK-1), Granzyme B-AF700
(GB11) from Beckton Dickinson; CD158a,h-PE-Cy7 (EB6B), CD158b1/b2,j-PE-Cy5.5 (GL183),

PE (5.133), CD159a-PE-Vio770 (REA110), CD159c-PE (REA205), Ki-67-PE Vio770 (REA183),
KIR2D-Biotin or PE (NKVFS1) from Miltenyi Biotec; TNFα-APC (MAb11) from eBioscience;
p-S6 ribosomal protein (S235/236)-PE (D57.2.2E) from Cell Signaling Technologies; KIR2DL3FITC (180701) from R&D Systems. Viability was determined using LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua
Dead Cell Stain kit (DCM) for 405 nM excitation and biotin-conjugated antibodies were visualized
using Streptavidin-QD705 (Life Technologies). Cells were fixed and permeabilized using
Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (eBioscience) followed by intracellular staining.
Samples were acquired on an LSR-Fortessa equipped with a 355, 405, 488, 561, and a 639 nm
laser. Sorting experiments were performed either on a FACSAria Fusion (Becton Dickinson)
equipped with a 405, 488, 561 and a 633 laser or on a FACSAriaII (Becton Dickinson) equipped
with a 405, 488, 561 and 640 nm laser. Cell sorting was performed at 4°C. Data was analyzed in
FlowJo version 9 (TreeStar, Inc.).
To minimize variation for daily readouts over the course of one week, CS&T beads (BD
Bioscience) and application settings in FACS DIVA were used to eliminate daily fluctuations in
the LSR-Fortessa. Additional controls included usage of a reference sample, consisting of a buffy
coat frozen in small aliquots which was thawed and stained for each experimental readout. Values
were then adjusted based on the reference values which were normalized over the days.
Fold change of pS6 expression on a particular day was calculated by comparing the observed
expression to baseline expression at day 0. Expansion index, the overall fold expansion of the
culture, was calculated based on the CTV dilution using the Proliferation tool in FlowJo.
t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analysis was performed using the Rtsne
package (http://cran.r-project.org/package=Rtsne) in R version 3.1.0. Events from one
representative donor were divided into generations by manual gating on CTV in FlowJo version

9. Then, 20 000 events were randomly sampled from each generation and data was pooled and
arcsinh transformed using cofactor 150. The t-SNE calculations were based on the markers
NKG2A, CD57, CD16, KIR2DL1, KIR2DL1/S1, KIR2DL3, KIR2DL2/S2/L3, KIR3DL1,
Granzyme B and pS6. Plots were generated using FlowJo or the ggplot2 R package
(http://ggplot2.org) and red borders were added using Photoshop CS6 (Adobe). “nKIR” values
were generated based on manual gating of KIR2DL1, KIR2DL3 and KIR3DL1 in FlowJo.

Functional assays
Cells were harvested, counted and seeded at an effector:target ratio of 1:1 in complete RPMI
medium (10% Fetal calf serum, 2mM L-glutamine). For the natural cytotoxicity and the antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay the target cells were K562 and P815 pre-incubated
with purified CD16 antibody (3G8, Becton Dickinson), respectively. The cells were incubated for
4h in the presence of brefeldin A (GolgiPlug, BD Biosciences, 1:1000 concentration), monensin
(GolgiStop, BD Biosciences, 1:1500 concentration) and CD107a antibody. After incubation,
normal surface and intracellular staining was performed with the addition of IFNγ and TNF
staining. For the flow cytometry based killing assays, NK cells were seeded at a 1:1 effector:target
ratio with K562 cells in complete RPMI medium together with Caspase 3- FITC in a 96-well Vbottom plate. The plate was centrifuged at 300 rpm for 3 min and then incubated for 4h at 37°C.
Post incubation, the cells were surface stained (CD3-PC5, CD56-ECD, DCM Aqua) followed by
fixation.

After 4 days of stimulation in 5ng/mL of IL-15, cells were treated either with DMSO, Rapamycin
(25 or 50 nM; Sigma) or Torin1 (125 or 250 nM; Apexbio) in the presence of continued IL-15.
After 48h of treatment, cells were harvest and stained for flow cytometry analysis.

Single-cell RNA sequencing
PBMCs from healthy blood donors were screened to determine the educated KIR subset. PBMC
were isolated using density gradient centrifugation, followed by NK cell isolation using the
DepleteS program on the AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated NK cells were labelled using
1μM CTV and rested overnight in complete RPMI medium (10% Fetal calf serum, 2mM Lglutamine). CTV-labelled NK cells were stained with the sorting panel and two populations
(CD56dimNKG2A+non-self/selfKIR-CD57-

&

CD56dimNKG2A-non-selfKIR-selfKIR+CD57+)

were sorted for single-cell RNA sequencing while a third population (CD56dim NKG2A- nonselfKIR- selfKIR+ CD57-) was sorted for culture. Cell sorting was performed at 4°C using a
FACSAriaII. Sorted cells were cultured in SCGM (10% human serum, 2mM L-glutamine, 5ng/mL
IL-15) in 96 U-bottom wells (200 µL) at 37°C and 5% CO2. IL-15 was replenished daily and
100μL of medium was replaced with fresh medium on day 3 of culture. After 6 days of culture,
NK cells were stained and FACS sorted based on cell division (CTV) into slowly (CD56+
Generation 0-1) and rapidly cycling (CD56+ Generation 2+) cells for single-cell RNA sequencing.
For single-cell RNA sequencing, 12,000 cells were sorted for each sample (two at baseline, one at
day 6) into Eppendorf tubes at 4°C. Cells were washed in PBS + 0.05% BSA and counted. 10,000
cells were resuspended in 35 µL PBS + 0.05% BSA and immediately further processed at the
Genomics Core Facility at Oslo University Hospital using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library &
Gel Bead Kit v2 and the Chromium Controller System (10X Genomics). The sequencing libraries

were generated following the recommended protocol. Sequencing was performed on a
NextSeq500 (Illumina) with 5~ % PhiX as spike-inn. Sequencing raw data were converted into
fastq files by running the Illumina`s bcl2fastq v2.

Bioinformatics analysis of single-cell data
The processed 10x files were analyzed in R using the Seurat package. The samples for each time
point were merged into one Seurat object (2 samples (1 donor) at baseline, 4 samples (2 donors)
at day 6) with retention of the original sample and donor ID. Quality control was performed to
remove potential multiplets and to remove outliers based on nUMI and nGene expression. In total
5652 cells passed the quality control phase for the baseline samples and 7556 cells passed the
quality control phase for the day 6 samples.
The data was then normalized using a scale factor of 10,000. Next, variable genes were detected
using a low x and y cutoff of 0.125 and 0.5 respectively. The dataset was then scaled and regressed
on nUMI and nGene. Linear dimensionality reduction was performed using Principle Component
Analysis (PCA) on variable genes and the statistically significant principle components (PCs) were
determined using both JackStraw and Elbow plots. Using the statistically significant PCs, the cells
were clustered using a resolution of 0.9 and visualized using tSNE. Cell cycle scoring was
performed using the expression of 94 cell cycle genes. Differentially expressed genes (log(fold
change) > 1.2) were then calculated between individual chosen clusters based on sample ID (subset
or cycling speed) and cell cycle scoring (cell cycle phase). Heatmaps were used to visualize scaled
expression of the differentially expressed genes ordered by log2(fold change) in the selected
clusters. Clustered heatmaps were used to visualize similarity between cells (annotated by sample
ID and cell cycle scoring) in terms of their expression of a given gene set.

Using gene over-expression analysis (Gene Ontology, PANTHER) of the 130 differentially
expressed genes at day 6, statistically significantly differences in terms of molecular function,
biological processes and pathways were determined. Lastly, using the same 130 differentially
expressed genes upstream regulators were determined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen).

Statistical analysis
Significance was calculated using either a Wilcoxon signed rank test or when comparing more
than 3 groups, a Friedman test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. Linear regression
analysis was performed followed by a Spearman r test to determine significance for correlations.
p-values: * <0.05, ** <0.01, *** < 0.001, **** <0.0001. Analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism 6 software.
