Abstract
With approximately 1,500 extant species, freshwater crabs (Decapoda: Brachyura) are among
the most diverse decapod crustaceans. Nevertheless, their fossil record is extremely limited:
only Potamidae, Potamonautidae and Trichodactylidae are reported up to the Eocene of the

40

Neotropics so far. This work documents unusually large decapod claws from the Upper
Cretaceous (Campanian) continental deposits of Velaux and vicinity (southern France), in close
association with large vertebrate remains. In addition to (1) the systematic assignment of these
claws, the study addresses (2) the salinity trends in the deposit environment from its faunal
assemblage and the elementary chemical patterns of fossils, and (3) the likely scenario for their

45

auto/allochtony in the Velaux fluvial system. These claws belong to a new taxon, Dinocarcinus
velauciensis n. gen. n. sp., referred to as Portunoidea sensu lato, a group of “true” crabs
nowadays linked to marine systems. However, the faunal assemblage, the claw taphonomy and
the carbonates Y/Ho signatures support their ancient freshwater/terrestrial ecology, making
them the oldest reported continental brachyurans and extending the presence of crabs in

50

freshwater environments by 40 Ma. Either as primary or as secondary freshwater crabs, the
occurrence of these portunoids in Velaux is an evidence for the independent colonizations of
continental environments by multiple brachyuran clades over time, as early as the Campanian.

I. Introduction

70

With approximately 1,500 extant species1, freshwater brachyuran crabs (Decapoda: Brachyura)
are among the most diverse decapod crustaceans. Nevertheless, their fossil record is extremely
limited. Representatives of three families were identified unequivocally as fossils, including
Potamidae Ortmann, 18962, Potamonautidae Bott, 19703 and Trichodactylidae H. Milne
Edwards, 18534

75

5–7

. Articulated exoskeletons of fossil freshwater crabs are rare7–14, although

isolated cheliped fingers are much more frequent, but difficult to evaluate taxonomically9,15–18. Up
to now, Tanzanonautes tuerkayi Feldmann et al., 200713 (Potamonautidae) from the Oligocene of
Tanzania (ca 30 Ma) is the oldest fossil record of a freshwater brachyuran in the Old World and
there is no remain of Potamidae older than early Miocene9. The oldest record of freshwater
crabs is from the middle Eocene of the Amazon Basin (ca 40 Ma) and belongs to the family

80

Trichodactylidae7, a group of crabs that likely colonized freshwater habitats independently from
potamoids, as indicated by morphology19 and molecular phylogeny20.
The present paper reports the remains of brachyuran crabs from fluvial Late Cretaceous
(late Campanian; ca 72-74 Ma) localities of southern France (Velaux-La Bastide Neuve and
vicinity), fossilized in associations with vertebrate remains. Close associations of different and

85

diverse fossil organisms may both (1) be the result of a long-distance transport of allochthonous
remains or (2) testify of local biocoenoses for which members of quite restricted ecosystems
deposited altogether. These claws are of exceptional large size compared to most Late
Cretaceous marine crab claws; and interestingly do not conform the morphology of any extant
freshwater crab family. The presence of presumably freshwater crabs in Campanian deposits is

90

quite unexpected and represents the earliest record of the colonization of freshwater
environments by brachyuran decapod crustaceans. It roughly doubles the previously oldest
evidence of 40 Ma, and would further support the independent invasion of freshwater
environment by several distinct brachyuran lineages6,21,22.
The herein study aims at (1) proposing an accurate systematics assignment for these claws,

95

(2) characterizing the actual salinity trend of their deposit environment, based on the channel
fauna assemblage and elementary chemical patterns of fossils and (3) identifying the relevant
taphonomic scenario for the presence of crab claws within a fluvial system. As all these
approaches support a neat freshwater or terrestrial signature for the living paleoenvironment of
these large-clawed brachyurans, we then discuss the implications for presumed multiple

100

invasions of freshwater habitats by crustacean decapods over time.

II. Velaux-La Bastide Neuve channel
Velaux-La Bastide Neuve is located in the western part of the Aix-en-Provence Basin, Southeastern
France. K-Ar dating of the locality was attempted based on glauconites collected from sandstones23,
105

but these minerals are clearly reworked from lower Aptian marine limestones and are therefore
useless for dating the site23. Magnetostratigraphic analysis of the deposits, however, correlates with
the normal chron of chron 3223, corresponding to an age of 71.6 to 74 Ma24. Along with correlations
with charophytes and dinosaur eggshell biozones, a late Campanian age for the locality may
confidently be proposed23,25–27. The fossil site is mostly known for its vertebrate assemblage,

110

recovered from three different sedimentological sequences and corresponding to newly described
dinosaur (titanosaurid sauropod26,28; rhabdodontid ornithopod29) and pterosaur (azhdarchid
pterosaur30) taxa, as well as eusuchian crocodilians27. Apart from the diapsids, vertebrates consist of
disarticulated pleurodiran and cryptodiran turtles, disconnected remains of sarcopterygian and
actinopterygian fishes and, chondrichthyan teeth. Freshwater bivalves (Unio) and gastropods (Physa,

115

Melania)30, macro-remains of angiosperm plants and charophytes complete the whole fossiliferous
assemblage together with the herein described crustacean remains. The lithological section consists
of 16.3 meters of alternating sandstones, siltstones – including paleosols – and mudstones. Lacustrine
limestones occur in the uppermost part of the section. The succession was deposited in a fluviolacustrine environmental setting. The sedimentology of the site together with the fossil assemblage

120

indicates a likely freshwater setting for the deposits. The succession of conglomeratic sandstones,
siltstones (including paleosols), mudstones and lacustrine limestone on top of the stratigraphic
section indicate sedimentation in, respectively, a low-energy fluvial channel, channel levees, alluvial
plain and lake23. Given the proximity of Velaux to the paleo-coast during the Late Cretaceous31,32,
occasional marine incursions are not excluded, even though they were not recorded at Velaux-La

125

Bastide Neuve nor at other fossiliferous localities of the same age in the region23,25.
III. Results
The studied material (Tab. 1) consists of seven (partial) claws and associated vertebrate remains

130

collected from sequence 2 of the sedimentary succession of Velaux-La Bastide Neuve locality and
one from the close locality of Rognac-Les Frégates (about four km from Velaux, corresponding to
similar layers). Specimens are housed in the palaeontological collections of the municipal
paleontological and archeological structures of Velaux (Musée du Moulin Seigneurial/Velaux-La

III.1. Systematic paleontology
III.1a: The crabs
Preliminary remarks: Taxonomic assignment of isolated claws of brachyuran crabs at the
species or genus level is difficult, if not impossible in many cases. If direct comparisons with

145

extant taxa is straightforward and often helpful for identifying Pliocene and Pleistocene
brachyurans33–36, this tasks already becomes more complicated when working with material of
Miocene age37–40. The taxonomic evaluation of isolated fossil cheliped fingers is of course
further challenging. Erecting new taxa based on isolated brachyuran chelae alone has not been
attempted yet, although this method is regarded as valid in other decapod groups, including

150

paguroid hermit crabs41–43, erymid lobsters44,45 or callianassid ghost shrimps46,47. If working with
distinct claw morphologies, the erection of new taxa can be done48. Alternatively,
parataxonomy can be used49. We assume that the morphology and also the size of the studied
claws from the two localities Velaux-La Bastide Neuve and Rognac-Les Frégates are distinct
enough to warrant the validity of the new form genus Dinocarcinus. Based on the general

155

morphology of its claws, we include this form genus within Portunoidea sensu lato50.
Taxonomic characters in the Dinocarcinus material do not allow their classification within any
known family, but rather point out its affinities to portunoids. In this sense, Dinocarcinus
velauciensis is kept in open nomenclature.

Etymology: Denoting the actual association with dinosaur (ornithopodan) remains.
Type species: Dinocarcinus velauciensis n. gen. n. sp.
175

Diagnosis: Chelae large and massive. Fingers gaping, arched, with strong teeth, proximal tooth
molariform. Fixed finger dorsal surface with single “pitted groove”, palm surface smooth,
articulation with dactylus oblique, prominent.
Remarks: The morphology of the claws, namely heavily calcified fingers, strong molariform teeth

180

and grooved fingers, are typical for some eubrachyuran crabs. There are only few representatives
of podotreme clades which grew to big sizes, with particular exceptions of Dakoticancridae and
Cenomanocarcinidae, which could have claws comparably large to Dinocarcinus velauciensis n. gen.
n. sp. Figured claws of Avitelmessus Rathbun, 192351 show the following51–53: the fingers’ (distal)
teeth are not molariform, fingers are less robust and less strongly calcified than the remains studied

185

herein. The claws of Avitelmessus are more curved, the palm is longer than the fingers, both palm
and fingers have crests and grooves; the fingers tips are hooked; distinguishing it easily from
Dinocarcinus n. gen. The palaeocorystoid Cenomanocarcinidae could attain large sizes and had
massive claws. The claws of Cenomanocarcinus Van Straelen, 193654 are figured by Guinot et al.55
(fig. 6) and are characterized by spinose claws, flattened in cross section, a slightly downturned

190

fixed finger, spines along the upper margin of the claw and dactylus, and hooked tips. Compare
also the very large claws of ‘Oncopareia’ heterodon Bosquet, 185456, now considered to be a
palaeocorystoid (in Jagt et al.57: plate 5). As discussed above, the claw morphology of Dinocarcinus
velauciensis n. gen. n. sp. does not match that of the Dakoticancroidea, Palaeocorystoidea, or any
known Podotremata.

195

Within Eubrachyura, the robust, strongly calcified fingers, overall claw shape, and molariform
teeth, match that of the Portunoidea. This large group of overall large-sized crabs have several
Mesozoic occurrences, and some of them in large sizes. Ophthalmoplax Rathbun, 193558, now
considered a representative of Macropipidae59 has a great size range, from very large
Ophthalmoplax brasiliana Maury, 193060 to rather small O. minimus Osso et al., 201061. Their claws

200

[compare62 (figs. 3.2, 3.3, 4.2, 4.13, 4.14) with61 (fig 6.7)] are spinose, keeled, with major claws
showing a large bulbous proximal tooth ascribed to shell breaking mechanisms63. These specialized
claws can be easily distinguished from the more simple, unarmed claws of Dinocarcinus n. gen.
Eogeryon Osso, 201664 (Cenomanian of Spain) is assigned to the Portunoidea in its own family
(Eogeryonidae Osso, 201664). Geryonidae Colosi, 192365 and Eogeryonidae are considered as early

205

diverging families within Portunoidea. Eogeryon is characterized by large claw size relative to the

carapace, equal ratio palm-fingers, with strongly calcified fingers with molariform teeth, and
grooved fixed finger. Its claw morphology is typical of that of Portunoidea, and compared with that
of Styracocarcinus meridionalis (Secrétan, 196166) from the ?Campanian, of Morocco. Claws of
Litoricola macrodactylus (Van Straelen, 192467) from the Paleocene of southern France and Northern
210

Spain, are highly comparable with those of Dinocarcinus n. gen., however they show a bulbous
proximal crushing tooth on the dactylus of the major claw. Also, the fingers in Dinocarcinus n. gen.
are more gaping as in Litoricola.
The claw morphology of Dinocarcinus n. gen. shows few diagnostic characters for superfamily
level assignment (Portunoidea), namely heavily calcified claws, a grooved fixed finger, molariform

215

teeth, palm and fingers subequal in length, and blunt, non-hooked fingertips (Fig. 2). More accurate
assignation is not possible at this point. An early diverging position within Portunoidea is possible
considering morphology, geologic age, large size, and similar families occurring at that time.

closely resembles a posterior cervical vertebra of a rhabdodontids Iguanodontia (Fig 1a-b).
Rhabdodontids are represented at Velaux by the genus Matheronodon Godefroit et al., 201729
and in other Late Cretaceous localities from southern France, by Rhabdodon Matheron, 186968.
MMS/VBN.09.69e is found in close sedimentary association with the plastral plate of a
250

terrestrial turtle (Solemys de Lapparent de Broin & Murelaga, 199669, Solemydidae) (Fig 1c-d).
MMS/VBN.12.A.006 is preserved in a 50 cm large block that also contains a turtle plastral plate
(Polysternon Portis, 188270, Bothremydidae), a rhabdodontid tooth and centrum, as well as
hybodontid shark teeth (Fig 1e-f). MMS/VBN.12.A.003, figured isolated (Fig. 3d), has been
extracted from a comparable block, also containing a crocodylomorph skull, a rhabdodontid
tooth, as well as a partial titanosaurid dorsal vertebra showing preserved ossified tendons.

III.2. Freshwater environment
III.2a: Taxonomic/ecologies diversity in the sequence 2 of the channel
The freshwater palaeoenvironment of the channel in sequence 2 is strongly supported not only by
sedimentological evidence23, but also by the most recently collected taxonomic assemblage itself.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/747535; this version posted August 28, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

The fossil remains consist of 42.5% of strict terrestrial/aerian Avemetatarsalia indicative of an
absolute continental faunal assemblage (Fig. 4). Aquatic and semi-aquatic taxa consist of families
and genera, which previous depositional record is strongly anchored in freshwater environments.
Among archosaurs, the hylaeochampisdae crocodylomorph Allodaposuchus Nopsca, 192827 71) has
270

so far been reported from fluvial inner/lacustrine-interpreted environments69,72,73 and once in a
more coastal swampy area74. These are associated to a small amount of Globidonta, which, as
members of Alligatoroidea, would have secondarily lost salt glands and therefore have been also
restricted to freshwater settings75. Other highly abundant sauropsids in Velaux are chelonians,
equivalently represented by Bothremydidae (Polysternon) and Solemydidae (Solemys, Fig. 4). If the
former family is recognised as the most abundant and diverse European group of freshwater and
coastal turtles in the uppermost Cretaceous76, Polysternon is only reported from estuarian to alluvial
sediments and its sister-genus Foxemys Tong et al., 199877 is exclusively known from freshwater
localities78,79. The case of Solemydidae is even more compelling because their dermal skeleton (skull
osteoderms) is highly supportive of a strict terrestrial life habit80 rather than any degree of

280

amphibious lifestyle. The identified chondrichtiyan teeth correspond to a unique hybodontid genus:
Meristonoides Case & Capetta, 200281, which presence at Velaux has been briefly questioned (Cuny
pers. comm. in23), although it is well accepted that hybodontid sharks are common in fluvial
ecosystems in the Cretaceous82. The least abundant remains at Velaux belong to an aquatic
sarcopterygian identified as Axelrodichthys megadromos Cavin et al., 201683 (Cavin pers. comm.).
The only known occurrence of this mawsoniid coelacanth is from another French Campanian
lacustrine deposit83, confirming the unequivocal freshwater nature of the fauna from the sequence
2, which includes the brachyuran claws in the Velaux-La Bastide Neuve channel (Fig. 4).
III.2b: Y/Ho ratios

290

As for other rare-earth-elements, the Y signature of limestones and carbonate concretions can be
used as recorder of ancient seawater signatures84–86. Y and Ho concentrations are compared
because these elements are chemically similar in charge and ionic radius, and suggested to evolve
similarly in poorly terrigenous diagenetic environments85. The carbonates of MMS/VBN.09.69eclaw display a Y/Ho ratio of 33.06 (Y=8.61 ppm; Ho=0.26 ppm). The ratio in MMS/VBN.09.69esediment is a bit lower with 29.86 (Y=11.3 ppm; Ho=0.37 ppm). Marine waters are known to have
a quite constant Y/Ho ratio around molar 90-110, decreasing with depth87,88. Consequently, neither
the sandstones hosting the claws, nor the claw carbonate could have been deposited and/or
formed in marine conditions. Apart from the marine realm, Y/Ho data characterizing formally

typical estuarine or fluviatile environments are hitherto not much reported89. Nozaki et al.89
300

evidenced from the study of Japanese fluvial systems that Y and Ho concentrations were constantly
decreasing with the salinity, with Ho removed from seawater twice as fast as Y owing to differences
in surface complexation behavior. Unfortunately, Y and Ho absolute concentrations, which we
would expect to interpret from the studied fossil/sediment material, depends on a biological and
a taphonomic factor of integration, which cannot be estimated. Consequently, the actual salinity
of the studied channel cannot be assessed from the chemistry but the observed Y/Ho ratio formally
excludes a marine pattern and seems to distinguish strongly from it.

III.3. Taphonomy of the assemblage
The crab chelae studied herein were recovered from the fluvial channel sediments from
sequence 2, which correspond to lenticular conglomeratic sandstone (Fig. 5a-b). This
association of elements belonging to diverse – aquatic and terrestrial – vertebrate taxa
320

probably results from the transport of decayed carcasses originating from diverse
environmental settings in a river channel. The associated bones and tooth elements are found
disarticulated. The preservation of some complete bony elements, like crocodylomorph skulls,
argues for their relatively short timing of decay and transport, consistent with the most

common reports of the group in fluvial/ inner lacustrine type of environments. The Velaux
taphonomy would indicate a local riverine system with a low-enough energy to allow the
deposit of small millimetric elements like Meristonoides teeth23. An option could be that large
elements (large appendicular bones, carapace portion and skulls) would have acted as obstacles
for smaller ones in a more intermediate-energy flow configuration, resulting in a mixture of
elements of different sizes and spatial origins23. In both cases, as in any continental water
330

system, the deposit must have occurred up to downstream implying that all the remains in
sequence 2 must have belonged either to original local fluvial living individuals (sedimentary
context) or to upstream/even more terrestrial ones (floodplain and levees). Consequently, the
presence of strictly freshwater lineages (Globidonta crocodylomorphs), would restrict the
salinity inside this part of the channel to a minimum, implying that crabs must have been living
either in terrestrial or freshwater aquatic habitats. The spatial distribution of the crabs within
the conglomeratic sequence (sequence 2 on Fig. 5c-d) is heterogeneous: they are in most cases
horizontally spaced by several dozens of centimeters. The absence of further connection of
the brachyuran remains (e.g. with manus/carpus) or other body parts than dactyli and/or
propodi is poorly informative on transport/exposure time experienced by claws given the

340

admitted proclivity of decapod crustaceans’ chelae to preserve the best after years (see90,91 for
brachyurans).
IV. Discussion
Beside their proposed systematics assignment, claw shape and important size cannot be used
to inform on a specific diet or life habit of the crabs, nor on the actual interactions they
could have maintained with reported members of their ecosystem. Interestingly, it is of note
stressing that consumption behaviours of decapod crustaceans by megaherbivorous
dinosaurs have been reported from the Campanian of two North American formations92. In

350

that case, representatives of ankylosaurs, brachylophosaurs and neornithischians were point
out to display scattered undetermined crustacean cuticles associated to fragments of likely
rotted wood fragments in their in-situ coprolites. This led the authors to suggest these
crustaceans were consumed when sheltered in dead logs without these cuticles could be
identified as belonging to a specific order, although possibly corresponding fossil crab-like
claws (not identified as Eubrachyura) were known from surrounding continental middle
Campanian formations92–94.

IV.1. Decapod crustaceans in freshwater habitats
Decapod crustaceans inhabit virtually all water-influenced habitats, including freshwater bodies,
from streams and rivers to ponds and lakes, and even caves. In fact, representatives of a number
360

of originally marine decapod clades have successfully invaded freshwater and/or terrestrial habitats.
Among caridean shrimps, more than 650 species, making a full quarter of all described species,
inhabit freshwater95, with representatives of Merguia Kemp, 191496 being semi-terrestrial97. With
approximately 650 species, virtually all crayfish are freshwater animals98. Many axiideans and
gebiideans are able to tolerate pretty low salinity conditions. The callianassid Lepidophthalmus
Holmes, 190499 is even able to tolerate freshwater environments100 and Lepidophthalmus turneranus
(White, 1861101) has been reported to migrate up rivers in West Africa102. Among anomurans, a
rather speciose family Aeglidae Dana, 1852103 is strictly freshwater104–106. The majority of freshwater
decapod crustaceans, however, consists of Brachyura with one fifth (>1 280 species) of all107.
Primary (so called true) freshwater crabs are those that have adopted freshwater, semi-

370

terrestrial or terrestrial modes of life, and are able to complete their life cycle independently of
the marine environment1. However, there are a number of brachyuran crabs able to live in
freshwater habitats that include euryhaline species or secondary freshwater species from primarily
marine brachyuran families1. These do not have direct development in their life cycle, which is
typical for true freshwater crabs. Today there are five primarily freshwater families of brachyuran
crabs107,

i.e.

Gecarcinucidae,

Potamidae,

Potamonautidae,

Pseudothelphusidae,

and

Trichodactylidae, whereas there are also numerous secondary freshwater, semi-terrestrial and
terrestrial species among Majoidea (Hymenosomatidae), Goneplacoidea (Goneplacidae),
Grapsoidea (Gecarcinidae, Sesarmidae, Varunidae) and Ocypodoidea (Ocypodidae)1. Many
grapsoids invade or even wholly inhabit freshwater habitats. Some varunids, including
380

representatives of Eriocheir De Haan, 1835108 and Varuna H. Milne Edwards, 1830109, not only enter
estuaries, but are also found further up in rivers1. Sesarmids (Sesarmoides, Labuanium, Karstarma)
can be completely adapted to freshwater, the latter being semi-terrestrial107,110–112, whereas
Geosesarma De Man, 1892113 is found in terrestrial habitats110,111.
As for the fossils from Velaux and surroundings newly described herein, it cannot be decided
unequivocally whether representatives of Dinocarcinus n. gen. were able to complete their life cycle
in the freshwater habitat or/and had direct development. The sheer size and number of claw
fragments, however, may prove that crabs from Late Cretaceous of Velaux were not only an
occasional element of the respective environment, but rather a natural part of the assemblage
suggesting that they were fully adapted to freshwater environment.

IV.2. Freshwater decapods in the fossil record
Fossil freshwater decapods are exceedingly rare in comparison to their marine relatives. Fossils
crayfishes are represented only by a handful of occurrences reported so far (110,111,114–118 and
references therein), the oldest coming from the Triassic of Utah115. Fossils of freshwater caridean
shrimps are similarly rare114,116,119–122, the oldest being reported from the Early Cretaceous of
Spain116 and China122. Interestingly, the only fossil representative of nowadays strictly freshwater
anomurans, the family Aeglidae, comes from marine strata123. Fossil freshwater brachyurans are
limited to a number of occurrences of isolated claws9,15–18 and several fossils exhibiting preserved
carapace7–13,124. The oldest occurrences of undisputed primary freshwater crabs are from the
middle Eocene (late Lutetian/early Bartonian) of the Amazon Basin, recently reported by Klaus et

400

al.7 who described isolated claw elements of Trichodactylidae, and from the middle Eocene
(Bartonian) of Italy (Alontecarcinus buratoi De Angeli & Caporiondo, 2019124) being the oldest
representative of Potamidae. In this respect, Dinocarcinus velauciensis n. gen. n. sp. reported herein
is the oldest occurrence of freshwater brachyuran crabs, exceeding previous reports by
approximately 40 million years. For now, it is unclear whether Dinocarcinus belonged to primary
or secondary freshwater crabs. It is, however, of note that recent advances in resolving the
phylogeny of primary freshwater crabs suggest their early divergence in brachyuran evolution125.
IV.3. Multiple invasions into freshwater habitats
From the discussion above it is clear that several lineages of decapod crustaceans independently

410

invaded freshwater habitats, including dendrobranchiatans126, carideans, axiideans, astacideans,
anomurans and brachyurans6,19,105,127. The enigmatic Tealliocaris Peach, 1908128, considered by some
authors as a decapod crustaceans129 (but see also130), might represent yet another freshwater
lineage. And among carideans, at least palaeomonoid, atyoid and alpheoid shrimps independently
invaded freshwater environments95. Moreover, presumed multiple invasions of freshwater habitats
by some Macrobrachium Bate, 1868131 shrimps were also suggested132. The sparse fossil record of
freshwater shrimps does not allow relevant time estimation of colonization of freshwater habitats;
however, fully freshwater shrimps are known from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) onward116,122.
Crayfish represent a monophyletic group133 with the oldest fossil representatives known from the
Late Triassic of Utah115. As for brachyuran freshwater crabs, there are two independent lineages.

420

The Old World primary freshwater crabs are monophyletic6,19,107,134, whereas Neotropical
Trichodactylidae have a separate phylogenetic origin and appear to be closely related to marine
Portunidae19,135. Based on the morphology of its chelae, Dinocarcinus velauciensis n. gen. n. sp. cannot

be referred to any of the extant primary or secondary freshwater families mentioned above
suggesting that it represents yet another independent “attempt” to colonize freshwater
environment besides the two primary freshwater crab clades recognized today, i.e., Potamoidea
and Trichodactyloidea19,107. Interestingly, the oldest fossil representatives of both clades come from
the middle Eocene7,124. The geographic distribution of modern primary freshwater crabs speaks for
independent invasions of the limnic habitat rather than for a Gondwanan vicariance6,136, contrasting
with the diversification of crayfishes: the fossil record and modern distribution of the latter clade
430

can be explained by the breakup of Pangaea and disassembly of Gondwana and Laurasia127. Based
on molecular clock estimates, Daniels et al.136 suggested that the radiation of Afrotropical
freshwater crab taxa occurred during the Early Cretaceous, whereas the age of the African
Potamonautidae clade was given with 75-73 Ma (Campanian). From the fossil record of the
modern freshwater families alone, such timing cannot be apprehended; however, the discovery of
fossil crabs from Velaux-La Bastide Neuve illustrates that brachyuran crabs attempted to colonize
freshwater habitats in the Old World at least from the Campanian onwards.
One of the key processes driving freshwater crab diversification is likely allopatric speciation
resulting from geographic isolation, often coupled with habitat heterogeneity and numerous
ecological niches and microhabitats resulting from the complicated topography and hydrology of

440

freshwater environments1. During the Campanian, Dinocarcinus velauciensis inhabited Europe, which
was at its time an archipelago rather than a proper landmass32,137. Based on the material from Velaux
and Rognac described herein, we suggest that the freshwater habitats of islands in the Tethyan
epicontinental sea were colonized by marine portunoids during the Late Cretaceous. Nowadays,
most secondary freshwater brachyurans have a marine larval development and would reach inland
habitats more likely as adults. This might also have been the case for Dinocarcinus velauciensis.
V. Conclusions
Dinocarcinus velauciensis n. gen. n. sp. from the late Campanian of Southern France, belongs

450

to Portunoidea sensu lato, a group of “true crab” that are nowadays intimately linked to
marine systems. The sedimentological context, faunal assemblage and taphonomy of these
fossils, as well as the Y/Ho ratio of their carbonates indicate an ancient freshwater or
terrestrial ecology. This make them the oldest freshwater/terrestrial brachyurans ever
reported, extending the existence of freshwater crabs by 40 Ma. In this Campanian
ecosystem, “true” crabs were intimately associated to terrestrial vertebrates, including

non-avian dinosaurs. Although they were likely well adapted to this environment, it cannot
be decided whether Dinocarcinus was able to complete its life cycle in the freshwater habitat
or/and had direct development. Its occurrence in the Late Cretaceous of Velaux-La Bastide
Neuve, is an evidence for the independent colonizations of freshwater environments by
460

multiple Brachyura clades over time, beside that of modern primary freshwater crabs
(Potamoidea, Trichodactyloidea). It also supports the molecular clock estimation of an
Early Cretaceous start for the radiation of Afrotropical freshwater crab taxa (just appearing
in the Late Cretaceous), with the evidence of brachyuran crabs colonizing freshwater
habitats as early as the Campanian.
VI. Methods
The elementary composition of a brachyuran claw and of its surrounding matrix were
investigated for their Y/Ho ratios. One gram of each was sampled on MMS.VBN.09.69e

470

(claw/sediment). For the claw material, the basis of the propodus embedded in the matrix
was mechanically sampled to preserve the connection between the claw and the turtle
plate. Samples were microgrinded and analysed for their composition in minor elements
(in µg/g) normalized to PAAS, using ICMPS at the Service d’Analyses des Roches et des
Minéraux of the CRPG, Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy, France.
Data Availability
All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and
