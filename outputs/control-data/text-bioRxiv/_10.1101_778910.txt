Abstract

23

Background

24

The etiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is largely unknown. Genome-wide transcriptomic

25

studies in bulk brain tissue have identified several molecular signatures associated with the

26

disease. While these studies have the potential to shed light into the pathogenesis of PD, they are

27

also limited by two major confounders: RNA post mortem degradation and heterogeneous cell

28

type composition of bulk tissue samples. We performed RNA sequencing following ribosomal

29

RNA depletion in the prefrontal cortex of 49 individuals from two independent case-control

30

cohorts. Using cell-type specific markers, we estimated the cell-type composition for each

31

sample and included this in our analysis models to compensate for the variation in cell-type

32

proportions.

33

Results

34

Ribosomal RNA depletion results in substantially more even transcript coverage, compared to

35

poly(A) capture, in post mortem tissue. Moreover, we show that cell-type composition is a major

36

confounder of differential gene expression analysis in the PD brain. Correcting for cell-type

37

proportions attenuates numerous transcriptomic signatures that have been previously associated

38

with PD, including vesicle trafficking, synaptic transmission, immune and mitochondrial

39

function. Conversely, pathways related to endoplasmic reticulum, lipid oxidation and unfolded

40

protein response are strengthened and surface as the top differential gene expression signatures

41

in the PD prefrontal cortex.

Conclusions

43

Differential gene expression signatures in PD bulk brain tissue are significantly confounded by

44

underlying differences in cell-type composition. Modeling cell-type heterogeneity is crucial in

45

order to unveil transcriptomic signatures that represent regulatory changes in the PD brain and

46

are, therefore, more likely to be associated with underlying disease mechanisms.

Introduction

49

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, affecting ~1.8

50

% of the population above 65 years [1]. PD is a complex disorder, caused by a combination of

51

genetic and environmental factors, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its etiology remain

52

largely unaccounted for. Genome-wide transcriptomic studies can identify expression signatures

53

associated with PD. While not able to establish causality, these studies hold the potential to

54

highlight important biological mechanisms, some of which may be exploited as targets for

55

therapeutic modulation.

56

A recent systematic review identified 33 original genome-wide transcriptomic studies in the

57

PD brain, of which 6 were performed on laser microdissected neurons from the substantia nigra

58

pars compacta (SNc) and the remaining in bulk tissue from various brain regions [2]. These

59

studies show surprisingly low replicability at the level of individual genes, however, and only

60

partial concordance for pathways. The most consistent alterations have been found in pathways

61

related to energy metabolism/mitochondrial function and protein degradation, followed by

62

synaptic transmission, vesicle trafficking, lysosome/autophagy and neuroinflammation [2].

63

While these processes commonly show differential expression signatures in PD, it remains

64

unknown whether this is because they truly reflect the biology of PD or due to systematic bias

65

and confounding factors. Two major sources of bias for transcriptomic studies in the human

66

brain are the post mortem degradation of RNA and the highly heterogeneous cell type

67

composition of bulk tissue samples.

68

RNA degradation of variable extent occurs in post mortem tissue. To further complicate the

69

picture, it has been shown that different cell types exhibit different degrees of susceptibility to

70

RNA degradation [3], potentially confounding differences in cellular composition with

71

differences in RNA quality. Access to high-quality brain tissue is generally limited, and thus an

72

optimal choice of experimental platforms becomes paramount to maximize sensitivity. While

73

RNA microarrays are being gradually superseded by RNA-seq technology, only 3 out of the 33

74

studies identified by an up-to-date review [2] used RNA-seq, and all of them employed poly(A)

75

capture, a widely used protocol to restrict the analysis to mature mRNA [4–6]. However, this

76

library preparation method only picks up RNA fragments with a poly-A tail, introducing

77

substantial bias in low quality RNA samples [7–10]. A well-established approach to mitigate this

78

limitation, is whole RNA-seq following ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion [11]. To our

79

knowledge there are no genome-wide transcriptomic studies on PD brain employing rRNA

80

depletion methods to date.

81

Systematic differences in sample cell composition represent another important confounding

82

factor. These typically originate from two sources: biological differences (e.g. secondary to

83

neurodegeneration) and technical variation in sample dissection and preparation. Brain areas

84

affected by neurodegeneration are characterized by neuronal loss and gliosis, resulting in a

85

systematically increased glia-to-neurons ratio in patients. This confounder is strongest in areas

86

with severe changes, such as the SNc, but is also present to a variable degree in less affected

87

areas, such as the neocortex. In addition, technical sources of variation due to sampling may

88

affect any brain region and cause an uneven distribution of gray and white matter, resulting in a

89

variable fraction of oligodendrocytes. Thus, transcriptional signatures associated with PD in bulk

90

93

Heterogeneous cell composition is, hence, a major confounder that needs to be considered and

94

appropriately addressed in transcriptomic studies in bulk brain samples.

95

We report the first genome-wide transcriptomic study in the PD brain employing RNA-seq

96

following rRNA depletion. We show that this approach is able to substantially mitigate the bias

97

of post mortem degradation, resulting in substantially better transcript coverage compared to

98

poly(A) capture. Moreover, by estimating the relative cell type proportion in our samples, we

99

confirm that cellular composition is a major source of variation in bulk tissue data, confounding

100

the differential gene expression profile even in the less affected prefrontal cortex. By

101

incorporating the estimated cell type proportions into our analysis models, we were able to

102

unveil transcriptomic signatures which are more likely to be associated with the underlying

103

disease mechanisms.

104

Results

105

Ribosomal RNA depletion is superior to poly(A) selection in post mortem brain

106

We carried out RNA-seq following rRNA depletion in fresh-frozen prefrontal cortex (Brodmann

107

area 9) from a total of 49 individuals from two independent cohorts: the Norwegian ParkWest

108

study (PW, n = 29) [13] and the Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB, n = 20). A detailed description

109

of our cohorts is provided in the methods. Comparison of our data to a published poly(A) capture

110

dataset of similar characteristics [4] revealed important differences of mapping coverage.

111

Mapping efficiency was slightly higher in the poly(A) dataset (median = 0.976, range = 0.971-

112

0.980) compared to the rRNA-depleted datasets (PW: median = 0.952, range = 0.940-0.962;

113

NBB: median = 0.959, range = 0.947-0.965). The counts per million (CPMs) of rRNA regions,

114

as defined by Ensembl release 75, was very low in all samples (PW: median = 3,099, range =

115

1,047-7,071; NBB: median = 1,583, range = 1,129-5,024) and, as expected, significantly lower

116

in the rRNA-depleted cohorts than in the poly(A) capture (poly(A) cohort: median = 40,058,

117

range = 10,701-95,183) (S1 Fig).

118

In both datasets, the RNA integrity number (RIN) was positively correlated with mapping

119

efficiency to mRNA regions, but not to intergenic and/or intronic regions (S2 Fig). Despite

120

having higher mean RIN values, the poly(A) capture cohort showed a marked unevenness of

121

transcript body coverage compared to the rRNA depletion samples (Fig 1A). The median

122

coefficient of variation in coverage was signiﬁcantly lower in the rRNA-depleted samples and

123

the 5’- and 3’- ends of the transcripts showed substantially better coverage compared to the

124

poly(A) sample (Fig 1B). Moreover, in the rRNA-depleted samples both the 3’- and 5’-end

125

coverage loss showed a significant inverse correlation with the RIN values. In contrast, RIN

126

showed no correlation with the 5’-bias and a positive correlation with the 3’-bias in the poly(A)

127

capture samples (Fig 1C). Thus, rRNA depletion results in substantially better and more even

128

coverage of the transcriptome in post mortem brain tissue, providing a better alternative to

129

poly(A) capture and minimizing the prospect of transcript quantification biases downstream.

130

Cell composition is a major confounder of gene expression in bulk brain samples

131

The observed gene expression profiles in bulk brain tissue can be dramatically influenced by

132

differences in cellular composition. Such differences can be a result of variation in gray/white

133

matter ratios introduced during tissue extraction, inter-subject variability or represent disease

134

related alterations [14–16]. To study the contribution of various technical and biological sources

135

of variation in our dataset we first estimated marker gene profiles (MGPs) for the major classes

136

of cortical cell types (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons) in our samples by
7

137

summarizing the expression of the cell type-specific marker genes as previously described [15].

138

Next, we examined the Pearson’s correlation between potential sources of biological variation in

139

our data, including technical and demographic factors (RIN, post-mortem interval (PMI), sex,

140

age, and disease status) and MGPs. As expected, MGPs for neuronal cell types were significantly

141

anticorrelated with the other main cortical cell types in both cohorts (p < 0.05, Fig 2A). In

142

agreement with previous studies [3,17], cellular estimates were also confounded with RNA

143

quality. In both cohorts RIN was significantly correlated with neuronal (positive correlation) and

144

astrocyte (negative correlation) MGPs. Significant negative correlation of RIN with microglia

145

MGPs was observed in the NBB cohort (Fig 2A). Most concerning was the detection of a

146

significant association between the oligodendrocyte MGP and the disease status in the PW

147

cohort (Fig 2A). The main axis of variation in gene expression (which explained 44% and 45%

148

of the total variance in PW and NBB, respectively) was significantly correlated with RNA

149

quality and cellular composition in both cohorts (Fig 2B), singling out RNA quality and cellular

150

composition as the main drivers of transcriptional change in bulk brain tissue.

151

We next looked for differences in cellular proportions between PD and controls adjusting for

152

the known experimental covariates (see methods). In the NBB cohort, PD subjects exhibited a

153

significant increase in the microglia MGP (p = 0.015, Wilcoxon test), while a significant increase

154

in the oligodendrocyte MGP (p = 5.5x10-3, Wilcoxon test) was observed in PD subjects from the

155

PW cohort. In both cohorts, these changes were accompanied by a non-significant decrease in

156

neuronal MGPs (Fig 2C).

157

Since the oligodendrocyte and microglia MGPs were significantly associated with the

158

disease status in at least one of the cohorts, we re-estimated group differences in astrocyte and

159

neuronal MGPs, adjusting for the significant MGPs, in addition to the original covariates. This

160

analysis showed no significant differences between the groups (S3 Fig). Therefore, only MGPs

161

of oligodendrocytes and microglia were included in the statistical model of differential

162

expression analysis.

163

Differential gene expression

164

Differential gene expression analysis of a total of ~31,000 pre-ﬁltered genes was carried out

165

using experimental covariates (sex, age, PMI, RIN, and sequencing batch) with or without

166

oligodendrocyte and microglia MGPs. In the PW cohort, 595 genes were defined as differentially

167

expressed (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR < 0.05) without adjusting for cell type composition.

168

Inclusion of oligodendrocyte and microglia MGPs in the model decreased the number of

169

differentially expressed genes to a total of 220. In total, 74 genes remained significant both with

170

and without adjustment for cell type composition. No transcripts with FDR < 0.05 were

171

identified in the NBB cohort, irrespective of adjustment for cell type composition. A list with the

172

nominally significant genes overlapping between the two cohorts is provided in S1 File.

173

Comprehensive results of differential expression analysis are available in S2 File.

174

Functional enrichment

175

Functional enrichment analysis of the differential gene expression results without MGP

176

adjustment indicated 476 significantly enriched (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR < 0.05) pathways in

177

PW (107 up-regulated and 369 down-regulated) and 992 in NBB (421 up-regulated and 571

178

down-regulated). MGP adjustment reduced the number of significant pathways to 89 in PW (35

179

up-regulated and 54 down-regulated) and 248 in NBB (115 up-regulated and 133 down-

180

regulated). Of these, 34 pathways replicated across the two cohorts. Concordant pathways

comprised protein folding, ER-related processes and lipid oxidation (Fig 3). The complete results

182

are provided in S3 File.

183

As expected, scoring each pathway according to the change in p-value when accounting for

184

cellularity, revealed a marked downplay of the relevant cell-type-specific functions (Table 1). In

185

the PW cohort, which was characterized by a skewed oligodendrocytes/neurons proportion, the

186

function with the largest attenuation (i.e. increase in p-value) was seen for up-regulation of

187

myelination and other oligodendrocyte related functions and for down-regulation of neuronal

188

pathways. For NBB, correcting for cell-composition resulted in attenuation of immunity and

189

neuronal pathways, consistent with the unbalanced microglial/neuronal proportions seen in that

190

cohort (Table 1). Strikingly, pathways linked to mitochondrial respiration, including respiratory

191

complex I, were among the down-regulated processes that lost statistical significance when

192

controlling for cellularity. The attenuation of the mitochondrial signal was observed in both

193

cohorts. Conversely, up-regulation of protein folding-related pathways gained significance in

194

both cohorts (Table 2 and Fig 3). Complete results are provided in S4 File.

Discussion

208

We present the first genome-wide transcriptomic study in the PD brain employing whole RNA-

209

seq after rRNA depletion. Our findings show that PD-associated differential gene expression

210

signatures in bulk brain tissue are influenced to a great extent by the underlying differences in

211

cell-type composition of the samples. Modeling cell-type heterogeneity allowed us to highlight

212

transcriptional signatures that are likely to represent aberrant gene expression within the cells of

213

the PD brain, rather than changes in cell composition.

214

Our results suggest that rRNA depletion is superior to the more commonly used poly(A)

215

capture approach and allows for a more accurate mapping and quantification of the transcriptome

216

in post mortem brain tissue. The rRNA depletion method provides substantially higher evenness

217

of coverage and effectively mitigates the 3’- and 5’-end coverage bias associated with poly(A)

218

capture [7–10]. Ultimately, the unevenness of coverage will influence transcript quantification,

219

affecting the sensitivity of the differential expression estimates.

220

Our study supports the notion that cell composition can be a major confounder in bulk brain

221

tissue transcriptomics. The observed expression profiles in both cohorts were driven

222

predominantly by a combination of technical factors associated with RNA quality, and

223

differences in cellular composition between PD and controls. This difference was primarily due

224

to oligodendrocytes in PW and microglia in NBB. Since oligodendrocyte proliferation is not a

225

pathological feature of PD, it is plausible that the difference in oligodendrocyte MGPs in PW

226

was due to technical variation in gray/white matter content introduced during tissue sampling.

227

Microglial infiltration does occur in affected areas of the PD brain [18]. It is noteworthy,

228

however, that increased microglial MGP was only observed in one of the cohorts (NBB),

229

highlighting the biological heterogeneity of PD. Accounting for relative cell proportions reduced

230

the number of differentially expressed genes and attenuated the calculated enrichment of cell-

231

type-specific pathways between PD and controls. In the PW cohort, this alleviated a substantial

232

false positive signature of oligodendrocyte genes presumably caused by skewed grey/white

233

matter sampling bias. Similar sampling bias could be responsible for oligodendroglia-specific

234

functions appointed to PD brain in previous transcriptomic studies [6].

235

Intriguingly, accounting for cellular proportions downplayed several of the transcriptomic

236

signatures that have been previously associated with PD. For instance, the signal from vesicle

237

trafficking- and synaptic transmission-related processes [19–24] was significantly attenuated in

238

both cohorts, suggesting that the signal was primarily driven by changes in neuronal proportions

239

between PD and controls, rather than modulation of these pathways within neurons. Moreover,

240

we observed an attenuation in the down-regulation of mitochondrial pathways, including the

241

respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation, which are among the most consistent

242

transcriptomic signatures in PD [2,4,19,21,25–28]. The loss of transcriptional signal in these

243

pathways is intriguing, because there is compelling evidence that decreased complex I protein

244

levels occur in PD neurons [29]. Our results suggest that the previously reported transcriptional

245

down-regulation of the respiratory chain is at least partly driven by altered cellular composition

246

(due to decreased number of neurons which highly express these genes) and may therefore not be

247

the sole mechanism by which neuronal complex I deficiency occurs in PD. Indeed, it has been

248

suggested that complex I deficiency in PD may be mediated by proteolytic degradation by the

249

LON-ClpP protease system, rather than transcriptional regulation [30].

250

Similar changes in the cell-composition of the brain are seen in all neurodegenerative

251

diseases, including PD, Alzheimer disease, ALS and Huntington disease. Interestingly, common

252

and overlapping transcriptional signatures have been reported across these neurodegenerative

253

diseases, including mitochondrial, neuronal-specific, and immunity-related pathways [31,32].

254

Our findings suggest that these common transcriptional signatures of neurodegeneration may be

255

largely confounded by a common pattern of altered cellularity, involving neuronal loss and glial

256

proliferation, rather reflect biological processes of causal nature.

257

Correcting for cell-type composition in our samples highlighted processes related to the

258

endoplasmic reticulum, unfolded protein response and lipid/fatty acid oxidation as the top

259

differential gene expression signatures in the PD prefrontal cortex. Unfolded protein response is

260

indeed one of the most consistently reported transcriptomic signatures in PD [2,4,21,25,33,34].

261

Moreover, endoplasmic reticulum stress and aberrant proteostasis have been associated with the

262

accumulation of misfolded proteins, including α-synuclein, in both in vitro studies and animal

263

models of PD [35]. While less is known regarding the role of lipid metabolism in PD, evidence

264

of aberrant fatty acid oxidation has been found by metabolomic studies in serum [36] and urine

265

[37] of patients. Our results corroborate these findings and indicate that aberrant fatty acid

266

metabolism occurs in the PD prefrontal cortex.

267

Based on our findings, we advocate that modeling cell-type heterogeneity is crucial in order

268

to unveil transcriptomic signatures reflecting regulatory changes in the PD brain. It is, however,

269

important noting that modeling of cellular estimates cannot completely mitigate the cell-

270

composition bias in bulk tissue. Moreover, cell-type correction complicates identification of

271

transcriptional events co-occurring with changes in cellular composition. Single-cell or cell-

272

sorting based methods will be key to overcoming this limitation and deciphering transcriptomic

273

signatures directly associated with underlying disease mechanisms in PD.

Materials and methods

275

Subject cohorts

276

All experiments were conducted in fresh-frozen prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) from a total

277

of 49 individuals from two independent cohorts. The first cohort (n = 29) comprised individuals

278

with idiopathic PD (n = 18) from the Park-West study (PW), a prospective population-based

279

cohort which has been described in detail [38] and neurologically healthy controls (Ctrl, n = 11)

280

from our brain bank for aging and neurodegeneration. Whole-exome sequencing had been

281

performed on all patients [39] and known/predicted pathogenic mutations in genes implicated in

282

Mendelian PD and other monogenic neurological disorders had been excluded. None of the study

283

participants had clinical signs of mitochondrial disease or use of medication known to influence

284

mitochondrial function (S5 File). Controls had no known neurological disease and were matched

285

for age and gender. The second cohort comprised samples from 21 individuals from the

286

Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB) including idiopathic PD (n = 10) and demographically matched

287

neurologically healthy controls (n = 11). Individuals with PD fulfilled the National Institute of

290

To investigate the effect of rRNA depletion compared to the prevailing poly(A) capture

291

method, we re-analyzed an RNA-seq dataset from a previous publication which employed a

292

poly(A) tail selection kit on post-mortem tissue of the same brain area and same disease (poly(A)

293

cohort, n = 29 PD samples, n = 44 neurologically healthy controls, all males; GEO: GSE68719)

294

[4].

295

Informed consent was available from all individuals. Ethical permission for these studies

296

was obtained from our regional ethics committee (REK 2017/2082, 2010/1700, 131.04).

297

Tissue collection and neuropathology

298

Brains were collected at autopsy and split sagittaly along the corpus callosum. One hemisphere

299

was fixed whole in formaldehyde and the other coronally sectioned and snap-frozen in liquid

300

nitrogen. All samples were collected using a standard technique and fixation time of ~ 2 weeks.

301

There was no significant difference in PMI (independent t-test, PW cohort p = 0.16; NBB cohort

302

p = 0.92), age (independent t-test, PW cohort p = 0.18; NBB cohort p = 0.074) or gender

303

(independent t-test, PW cohort p = 0.94; NBB cohort p = 0.53) between PD subjects and

304

controls. Subject demographics and tissue availability are provided in S5 File. Routine

305

neuropathological examination including immunohistochemistry for α-synuclein, tau and beta

306

amyloid was performed on all brains. All cases showed neuropathological changes consistent

307

with PD including degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the SNc in the presence of Lewy

308

pathology. Controls had no pathological evidence of neurodegeneration.

RNA sequencing

310

Total RNA was extracted from prefrontal cortex tissue homogenate for all samples using RNeasy

311

plus mini kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase treatment according to manufacturer’s protocol.

312

Final elution was made in 65 µl of dH2O. The concentration and integrity of the total RNA was

313

estimated by Ribogreen assay (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), and Fragment Analyzer (Advanced

314

Analytical), respectively and 500 ng of total RNA was used for downstream RNA-seq

315

applications. First, rRNA was removed using Ribo-Zero™ Gold (Epidemiology) kit (Illumina,

316

San Diego, CA) using manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Immediately after the rRNA

317

removal the RNA was fragmented and primed for the ﬁrst strand synthesis using the NEBNext

318

First Strand synthesis module (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA). Directional second

319

strand synthesis was performed using NEBNExt Ultra Directional second strand synthesis kit.

320

Following this the samples were taken into standard library preparation protocol using

321

NEBNext® DNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina® with slight modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy,

322

end-repair was done followed by poly(A) addition and custom adapter ligation. Post-ligated

323

materials were individually barcoded with unique in-house Genomic Services Lab (GSL)

324

primers and ampliﬁed through 12 cycles of PCR. Library quantity was assessed by Picogreen

325

Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), and the library quality was estimated by utilizing a DNA High

326

Sense chip on a Caliper Gx (Perkin Elmer). Accurate quantiﬁcation of the ﬁnal libraries for

327

sequencing applications was determined using the qPCR-based KAPA Biosystems Library

328

Quantiﬁcation kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc.). Each library was diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of

329

12.5 nM and pooled equimolar prior to clustering. 125 bp Paired-End (PE) sequencing was

330

performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina, Inc.). RNA quality, as measured by

331

the RNA integrity number (RIN), varied across samples (mean = 5.3, range = 3.0-7.2 for PW;

mean = 6.8, range = 3.2-9.1 for NBB, S5 File), although the difference between conditions did

not reach statistical significance in any of the cohorts (t-test P = 0.72 and 0.90 for PW and NBB

cohorts, respectively).

FASTQ ﬁles were assessed using fastQC version 0.11.5 [43] prior and following trimming. For

340

an in-depth quality assessment, we mapped the trimmed reads using HISAT2 version 2.1.0 [44]

341

against the hg19 human reference genome (using --rna-strandness RF option) preserving lane-

speciﬁc information. To discard potential lane-specific sequencing batch effects we inspected the

343

output of the CollectRnaSeqMetrics tool of Picard Tools version 2.6 [45]. Mapping efficiency

354

collapsed onto gene-level quantification using the tximport R package version 1.8.0 [47]

355

according to the gene definitions provided by the same Ensembl release. We ﬁltered out genes in

356

non-canonical chromosomes and scaffolds, and transcripts encoded by the mitochondrial

357

genome. To further reduce the potential for artifacts we filtered out transcripts with unusually

358

high expression by removing transcripts that gathered more than 1% of the reads on more than

359

half of the samples, which resulted in the removal of 3 and 4 transcripts from the PW and NBB

360

cohorts, respectively. Additionally, low-expressed (i.e. genes whose expression was below the

361

median expression in at least 20% of the samples) were filtered out from downstream analyses.

362

Samples were then marked as outliers if their median correlation in gene expression (log counts

363

per million) with the other samples was below Q1-1.5*IQR or above Q3+1.5*IQR (Tukey’s

364

fences; Q1: first quartile, Q3: third quartile, IQR: inter-quartile range). As a result, 3 samples

365

were marked as outliers in the PW cohort and 3 in the NBB cohort, and were not included in

366

downstream analyses (resulting sample sizes: NPW = 26, NNBB = 18, S4 Fig).

367

Estimation of cell composition

368

For each sample we calculated correlates for the main cortical cell type types (neurons,

369

oligodendroglia, microglia and astrocytes) by summarizing the expression of their respective

370

marker genes as the first principal component of their expression (marker gene profiles, MGPs

371

(Mancarci et al., 2017)). Cortical cell type markers were selected using the homologene R

372

package version 1.5.68 [48]. To unravel potential complex interactions between MGPs and other

373

experimental covariates, including disease status, we calculated the pairwise correlation between

374

all the variables and also their association with the main axes of variation of gene expression. To

375

assist us in choosing an optimal set of MGPs to include as covariates, we quantified the group

376

differences in the cellular proportions between PD and controls using linear models adjusting for

377

the known experimental covariates (i.e. RIN, PMI, sex, age, and sequencing batch). Significant

378

association with disease status was found for oligodendrocyte MGP in the PW cohort and for

379

microglia in the NBB cohort. Thus, these were included in the downstream analyses.

380

Differential gene expression and functional enrichment analyses

381

We performed differential gene expression analyses using the DESeq2 R package version 1.22.2

382

[49] with default parameters. Experimental covariates (sex, age, RIN, PMI, and sequencing

383

batch) as well as oligodendrocyte and microglia MGPs were incorporated into the statistical

384

model. Multiple hypothesis testing was performed with the default automatic ﬁltering of DESeq2

385

followed by FDR calculation by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Analyses were carried out

386

independently for the two cohorts. Genes were scored according to their significance by

387

transforming the p-values to account for direction of change. For each gene, the up-regulated

388

score was calculated as 𝑆up = 0.5 + sign(LFC) ∙ 𝑝/2, and the down-regulated score as 𝑆down =

389

1 − 𝑆𝑢𝑝 , where LFC corresponds to the log fold change and p to the nominal p-value of the gene.

390

Genes were then tested for enrichment using alternatively Sup and Sdown scores employing the

391

gene score resampling method implemented in the ermineR package version 1.0.1 [50], an R

392

wrapper package for ermineJ [51] with the complete Gene Ontology (GO) database annotation

393

[52] to obtain lists of up- and down-regulated pathways for each cohort.

394

In order to characterize the main biological processes affected by the cell type correction, we

395

scored pathways based on the loss of significance caused by the addition of cellular estimates to

396

the gene expression model. We quantified the difference in the level of significance in the up-

397

and down-regulated enrichment results for each significant pathway as ∆= log(𝑝0 ) − log(𝑝𝐶𝑇 ),

398

where 𝑝𝐶𝑇 and 𝑝0 are the enrichment p-values for the model with cell types (CT) and without (0),

coverage quality metrics: median 5’-bias, median 3’-bias and median coefficient of variation

599

(CV) for each cohort. The bias metric is calculated by Picard tools on the 1000 most highly

600

expressed transcripts and corresponds to the mean coverage of the 3’(or 5’)-most 100 bases

601

divided by the mean coverage of the whole transcript (asterisks indicate significance at (*) p >

expanded in (C), with sample scatterplots showing RIN values against the coverage quality

metrics. Linear regression trends are indicated with black lines. P-values for the F-statistic of the
