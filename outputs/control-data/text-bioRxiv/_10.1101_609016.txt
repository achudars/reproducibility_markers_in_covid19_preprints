ABSTRACT
Background
The Iberian Peninsula stands out as having variable levels of population admixture and isolation,
making Spain an interesting setting for studying the genetic architecture of neurodegenerative
diseases.
Objectives
To perform the largest Parkinson disease (PD) genome-wide association study (GWAS)
restricted to a single country.
Methods
We performed a GWAS for both risk of PD and age-at-onset (AAO) in 7,849 Spanish
individuals. Further analyses included population-specific risk haplotype assessments, polygenic
risk scoring through machine learning, Mendelian randomization of expression and methylation
data to gain insight into disease-associated loci, heritability estimates, genetic correlations and
burden analyses.
Results
We identified a novel population-specific GWAS signal at PARK2 associated with AAO. We
replicated four genome-wide independent signals associated with PD risk, including SNCA,
LRRK2, KANSL1/MAPT and HLA-DQB1. A significant trend for smaller risk haplotypes at
known loci was found compared to similar studies of non-Spanish origin. Seventeen PD-related
genes showed functional consequence via two-sample Mendelian randomization in expression
and methylation datasets. Long runs of homozygosity at 28 known genes/loci were found to be
enriched in cases versus controls.
Conclusions
Our data demonstrate the utility of the Spanish risk haplotype substructure for future finemapping efforts, showing how leveraging unique and diverse population histories can benefit
genetic studies of complex diseases. The present study points to PARK2 as a major hallmark of
PD etiology in Spain.

INTRODUCTION
Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex disorder arising from the interplay of polygenic risk,
environment and stochastic factors occurring in an unpredictable manner 1. Over the last 20
years, extensive work in molecular genetics has dissected the underlying genetic cause of several
familial and early-onset patients in which disease was inherited in a Mendelian fashion.
However, while just a small percentage of PD cases are monogenic, often exhibiting variable
penetrance, the vast majority are considered to be sporadic with complex genetic influence.
An important step forward in favor of a genetic contribution to the etiology of idiopathic PD has
been taken from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The implementation of a large-scale,
unbiased approach aimed at identifying genetic susceptibility factors has substantially improved
our understanding of the pathogenic pathways relevant to disease. To date, 90 loci have been
associated with idiopathic PD 2. Yet, despite great advances in the field, only a small proportion
of the heritable component of PD has been mapped. Total estimates of genetic variation
attributed to PD are roughly 21% 3.
GWAS meta-analyses have been crucial to identifying and expanding the biological knowledge
of novel disease risk factors. However, one of the main challenges is the heterogeneity across
cohorts that might mask genetic associations specific to certain populations. Therefore,
establishing population specific catalogues of genetic variation when studying the genetic basis
of PD is necessary.
Separated from the rest of Europe by the Pyrenees range of mountains and just 700 miles from
the North coast of Africa, the Iberian Peninsula represents a cross-link between two continents
and stands out as having remarkably variable levels of admixture, which has been reinforced by
linguistic and geopolitical boundaries within the territory 4. The Spanish population has a more
diverse haplotypic structure in comparison with other European populations and is somehow
isolated within itself in terms of global genetic structure 5. The long-lasting migratory influences
since early centuries and ulterior admixture from a number of civilizations over recent history
have left their genetic imprint, thereby creating a particular genome population structure and
diversity 6. Taken together, these observations make Spain an interesting setting to
comprehensively study the genetic architecture of PD and other complex diseases.

Here, we have performed the largest PD genome-wide assessment from a single country to date,
by characterizing 7,849 Spanish individuals. We compared our new Spanish dataset with extant
data from various European ancestry populations to relate our findings in the context of larger
studies. We also analyzed risk profiles, heritability and autozygosity in this population as it
relates to PD etiology. Of particular interest are our analyses leveraging the unique population
genetic structure of Spain to identify smaller risk haplotype blocks than in less admixed
Europeans. We envisage that the data generated from this large study, together with other
concomitant efforts underway in other European populations, will be key to shed light on the
molecular mechanisms involved in the disease process and might pave the way for future
therapeutic interventions.

METHODS

Cohort characteristics
A total of 7,849 individuals (4,783 cases and 3,066 neurologically healthy controls) were
recruited from 13 centers across Spain. PD patients were diagnosed by expert movement
disorders neurologists following the standard criteria of the United Kingdom PD Society Brain
Bank 7. The respective ethical committees for medical research approved involvement in genetic
studies and all participants gave written informed consent. Controls were extensively assessed to
rule out any sign of neurological condition. Detailed demographic characteristics of each Spanish
sub-cohort are summarized in Supplementary Table 1, with an average age at onset (AAO) for
cases of 61.23 +/- 11.47, age at recruitment for controls of 61.79 +/- 11.05, 42.27 % of female
cases and 56.06 % female controls.

Genotyping and quality control analyses
Samples were genotyped using the customized NeuroChip Array v.1.0 or v.1.1 (Illumina) 8. This
array contains a backbone consisting of 306,670 tagging variants (Infinium HumanCore-24 v1.0)
that densely cover ancestry informative markers, markers for determination of identity by
descent (IBD) and X chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for sex

determination. Additionally, NeuroChip contains a custom content consisting of 179,467
neurodegenerative disease-related variants.
Genotypes were clustered using Illumina GenomeStudio v.2.0. Quality control (QC) analysis
was performed as follows: samples with call rates of less than 95% and whose genetically
determined sex from X chromosome heterogeneity did not match that from clinical data were
excluded from the analysis. Samples exhibiting excess heterozygosity estimated by an F statistic
> +/- 0.25 were also excluded. Once preliminary sample-level QC was completed, SNPs with
minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) p-value < 1E-5 and
missingness rates > 5 % were excluded. Genetic variants passing QC numbered 433,768 SNPs.
Genotyped SNPs thought to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a sliding window of 50
adjacent SNPs which scrolled through the genome at a rate of 5 overlapping SNPs were also
removed from the following analyses (as were palindromic SNPs). Next, samples were clustered
using principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate European ancestry as compared to the
HapMap3 CEU/TSI populations (International HapMap Consortium, 2003) (Supplementary
Figure 1). Confirmed European-ancestry samples were extracted and principal components
(PCs) 1-20 were used as covariates in all analysis. Samples related at the level of cousins or
closer (sharing proportionally more than 18.5 % of alleles) were dropped from the following
analysis. After filtering, 4,639 cases and 2,949 controls remained. The data were then imputed
using the Haplotype Reference Consortium r1.1 2016 (http://www.haplotype-referenceconsortium.org), under default settings with phasing using the EAGLE option. Imputed variants
numbered 9,911,207 after filtering for MAF > 1% and imputation quality (RSQ) > 0.3.

Genome-wide association study versus Parkinson disease, age at onset and risk haplotype
structure
To estimate risk associated with PD, imputed dosages were analyzed using a logistic regression
model adjusted for sex, AAO for cases or examination for controls and the first 20 PCs as
covariates. Summary statistics were generated using the RVTESTS package 9 and filtered for
inclusion after meeting a minimum imputation quality of 0.30 and minor allele frequency greater
than 1 %. To explore the influence of genetic variation on the AAO of PD cases, a linear

regression model, adjusted for the same covariates, was performed (using AAO as the outcome
instead of as a covariate).
Given the history of admixture in Spain, we hypothesized that there might be smaller haplotype
blocks at risk loci than in less admixed populations 10. We compared the size of the 90
independent risk haplotype blocks in Spanish cases with a British ancestry PD cohort composed
of 1,478 cases. After standardizing both datasets with the same genotyped SNPs passing
identical quality control in both datasets, we determined the size of the haplotype blocks in both
populations by using PLINK 1.9 11.

Whole genome sequencing analysis
To dissect the novel GWAS signal associated with AAO identified in the Spanish population, we
performed whole genome sequencing analyses in 5 out of 37 homozygous carriers of the PARK2
signal. DNA concentration was determined by Qubit fluorescence and normalized to 20 ng/ul.
One microgram total genomic DNA was sheared to a target size of 450 bp using the Covaris
LE220 ultrasonicator. Library preparation was achieved using TruSeq DNA PCR-Free High
Throughput Library Prep Kit and IDT for Illumina TruSeq DNA UD Indexes (96 Indexes, 96
Samples). Sequencing libraries were assessed for size distribution, absence of free adapters and
adapter dimers on a Fragment Analyzer. Library quantitation was performed by quantitative PCR
using KAPA Library Quantification Kit subsequent normalization to 4 nM. Libraries were
clustered on v2.5 flowcell using Illumina cBot 2 System prior to sequencing on Illumina HiSeq
X System using paired-end 150 bp reads. BCL files processed with alignment by ISAAC on
HAS 2.2 and BAMs were used for quality control assessment of mean coverage, percent
duplicates, percent bases > 20x coverage and percent noise sites.

Genetic risk profiling
Polygenic risk score analysis for PD and AAO was performed as described in detail elsewhere
12,13

. Briefly, a cumulative genetic risk score was calculated by using the R package PRSice2 14.

Permutation testing and p-value after LD pruning was used to identify best P thresholds in

external GWAS data (training dataset derived from summary statistics from Nalls et al. 2019 2,
excluding Spanish samples) to construct the PRS, allowing us to utilize variants below the
common GWAS significance threshold of 5E-08. LD clumping was implemented under default
settings (window size = 250kb, r2 > 0.1) and using the Spanish dataset (testing dataset), 10,000
permutations were applied to generate empirical P estimates derived P threshold ranging from
5E-08 to 0.5, at a minimum increment of 5E-08. Each permutation test provided a Nagelkerke’s
pseudo r2 after adjustment for an estimated prevalence of 0.5%, study-specific eigenvectors 1-20,
AAO for cases or examination for controls and sex as covariates. GWAS derived P threshold
with the highest pseudo r2 was selected for further analysis.

Machine Learning to predict disease status
Summary statistics from the most recent meta-analysis excluding Spanish cohort samples 2 were
used for initial SNP selection in our Machine Learning (ML) analyses. This analysis utilizes an
upcoming software package (GenoML, https://genoml.github.io), an automated Machine
Learning tool that optimizes basic machine learning pipelines for genomic data. We used PD
GWAS full summary statistics in the ML feature selection process from which we removed
samples present in the Spanish PD cohort to avoid any circularity. Prior to analyses, we filtered
the Spanish cohort genotype data for MAF > 1% and imputation quality > 0.8. Next, we
randomly sampled without replacement 70% of the subjects for training the classifier and the
other 30% for its validation. We opted to use PRSice 14 to pre-filter variants under default
settings yielding 1,521 candidate variants from GWAS at a p-value threshold of 0.0005. In both
the training and test sets, the dosage of each of the 1,521 variants per individuals is weighted by
the GWAS beta. We then used a Caret ML [https://github.com/topepo/caret] framework with
glmnet, xgbTree, xgbDART, xgbLinear and Random forest, with a grid search size of 30- and
10-fold cross validation on the training set. The algorithm maximizing mean area under the curve
across iterations of cross-validation in the training set was then fit to the validation set to
generate predictions and summary statistics.

Heritability estimates and genetic correlations

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/609016; this version posted April 18, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

The heritability of PD in the Spanish population was calculated using Linkage Disequilibrium
Score Regression (LDSC) 15. This method has the ability to detect the contributions to disease
risk of variants which do not reach genome significance but does not identify the specific
variants contributing to disease risk. Using the same software, genetic correlations between PD
and other catalogued GWAS studies were evaluated. The database, LD Hub, was used to screen
overlapping genetic etiologies across 757 diseases/traits gathered from publicly available
resources 15. Default settings were used in the analyses and final results were adjusted for
multiple testing by using Bonferroni correction.

Runs of homozygosity
Based on LD-pruned dataset (using previously described parameters), runs of homozygosity
(ROHs) were defined using PLINK 1.9 11. We explored ROHs containing at least 10 SNPs and a
total length ≥ 1000 Kb, with a rate of scanning windows of at least 0.05 (not containing > 1
heterozygous call or 10 missing calls). In order to explore overall homozygosity between cases
and controls, three metrics were assessed, including the number of homozygous segments spread
across the genome, total kilobase distance spanned by those segments, and average segment size
(autosomes only). Subsequently, ROHs were further investigated for known PD risk gene
regions (Supplementary Table 2) and PD significant loci from GWAS 2 with a window of +/- 1
Mb upstream or downstream. In these analyses, cryptically related PD individuals removed in
previous steps were included to identify overrepresented sharing of recessive regions among
cases.

Burden analyses
We examined the contribution of rare variation on disease risk by collapsing the cumulative
effect of multiple genetic variants at a per-gene level. We performed the Sequence Kernel
Association Test (SKAT) in imputed data after classifying variants into nested categories (based
on two maximum minor allele frequency thresholds, (a) < MAF 1% or (b) < MAF 5%, and three
functional filters, (1) non-coding variants, (2) only coding and (3) Combined Annotation
Dependent Depletion (CADD) likely damaging). Burden analyses were adjusted for the first 20

PCs, AAO (cases) or examination (controls), and sex. These were run using default settings as
part of the RVTESTS package 9. To adjust for multiple comparisons, we applied Bonferroni
correction. Predictions of variant pathogenicity were obtained from ANNOVAR 16, based on the
CADD algorithm (v1.3, http://cadd.gs.washington.edu) 17. In accordance with previous reports
18

, we selected a stringent CADD C-score threshold

≥ 12.37, representing the top ∼2% most

damaging of all possible nucleotide changes in the genome.

Quantitative trait loci Mendelian randomization
Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to investigate possible functional
genomic associations between PD known genes (Supplementary Table 2) and nominated loci 2
and expression or methylation quantitative trait loci (QTL) using summary statistics from this
GWAS of the Spanish population to represent the outcome. Brain and blood QTL association
summary statistics from well-curated methylation and expression datasets available via the SMR
website (http://cnsgenomics.com/software/smr)19 were considered possible exposures in the MR
models. These include estimates for methylation and cis-expression across multiple brain regions
20

. We also studied expression patterns in blood from the meta-analyses as described

21

SNP Summary-data-based MR was utilized to generate association estimates via MR between
each QTL and local PD risk SNPs that contained 2 or more SNPs under default settings 19. The
current Spanish dataset was used as a reference for linkage disequilibrium in this analysis. For
each reference QTL dataset, p-values were adjusted by false discovery rate.

Known genetic factors in Parkinson disease and atypical parkinsonism related genes
Considering both related and unrelated samples, we screened for relevant variants in known PD
or parkinsonism-related genes. Our criteria included variants tagged as “disease causing
mutation”, “possibly disease causing mutation”, “probably disease-associated polymorphism”,
“disease-associated polymorphism with additional supporting functional evidence”, “pathogenic”
or “possibly pathogenic” in ClinVar 22 or Human Gene Mutation Database 23. We followed two
models: a putative dominant model (either the allele is present only in cases and absent in
controls or with a lower frequency in controls) and a putative recessive model (two copies of the

RESULTS

Genome-wide association for Parkinson disease risk, age at onset and population-specific
risk haplotype structure analyses
We identified four genome-wide independent signals associated with PD risk, including SNCA,
LRRK2, KANSL1/MAPT and HLA-DQB1 (Figure 1, Table 1, Supplementary Figure 2).
Additionally, we show trends for association at an uncorrected p-value < 0.05 with 39 of the 90
loci previously identified in the largest PD meta-analysis performed to date 2 (Supplementary
Table 3).

GWA for AAO of PD revealed a genome-wide significant association signal at PARK2
(rs9356013, beta= -4.11, se= 0.56, corrected p-value= 4.44 E-13) (Figure 2, Supplementary
Figure 3-4). The association signal was only observed in the Spanish population and not in
other International Parkinson’s Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC) datasets 28. A total of 37
cases carried the SNP in the homozygous state and 440 cases in the heterozygous state, which
represents 9.5% of the Spanish PD cases. After removing rs9356013 homozygous carriers from
the linear regression analysis, the signal dropped substantially (beta= -2.64, se = 0.74, p-value=
3.41 E-4). The mean AAO for the rs9356013 homozygous carriers was 42.67 +/- 14.58 years
while for the heterozygous carriers was 60.07 +/- 12.64 as compared to the AAO of the overall
case series which was 61.23 +/- 11.47. Whole-genome sequencing analyses performed in 5 out
of the 37 homozygous rs9356013 carriers revealed that all of them carried the deleterious
frameshift mutation PARK2 c.155delA (p.Asn52Metfs), which is located in exon 2 and 39 Kb

away from the GWAS signal. Among them, four individuals carried the variant in the
homozygous state and one in heterozygous state (Supplemental Figure 5).
Sanger sequencing of the PARK2 c.155delA variant (p.Asn52Metfs) in 1,275 PD cases followed
by conditional analyses was performed to dissect whether the GWAS signal was tagging the
indel. Conditional analyses for rs9356013 conditioning on c.155delA suggested that the common
variant rs9356013 and the rare indel c.155delA were most likely dependent signals (rs9356013
linear model p-value = 1.13E-05; c.155delA linear model p-value = 3.77E-08; rs9356013 p-value
after conditional analysis on c.155delA = 0.02, beta = -3.38, se= 1.46).
Haplotype size at risk loci in a matched cohort of British ancestry PD cases was 13.73 (+/- 32.9)
Kb larger than the Spanish at overlapping loci. At consensus genotyped variants, a total of 11
risk haplotype blocks were smaller in the Spanish population than in the British, 23 were the
same size, and 2 were larger (Supplementary Table 4). Other risk loci did not have multi-SNP
genotyped haplotypes spanning top risk variants from external GWAS in both cohorts for
comparison.

Genetic risk profiling versus disease and age-at-onset
After adjusting for appropriate covariates and estimated PD prevalence, an overall pseudo r2
between PRS and PD was approximately r2=0.026. For each standard deviation from the
population mean of the PRS, risk was estimated to be an odds ratio of 1.667 (beta = 0.511, se =
0.027, p-value = 3.63E-79, empirical P after permutation 1.00E-4). This model incorporated a
total of 665 SNPs up to p-value < 5.99E-05 in the current GWAS (Figure 3A-B).
Similar models were generated for AAO. We observed an association between a one standard
deviation increase in the age at onset polygenic score and a near one year earlier onset of disease
(beta = -0.944, se = 0.346, p-value = 0.006, empirical P after permutation = 0.031) This model
utilized all unlinked variants of interest, pruned down to 271,191 SNPs (Figure 3C-D).

Machine learning to predict disease status
The xgbDART algorithm 28 (extreme gradient boosting approach with additive linear regression
trees regularized by drop-out) yields the best AUC as predictor of the probability PD in this

Spanish GWAS cohort. The model in the validation set had an AUC of 0.6205 with a sensitivity
and specificity of 0.86 and 0.24. This is a ~1% improvement over using simply polygenic risk
scores prediction with PRSice alone, even after employing a two-stage design compared to a
previous single phase that could be more overfit than what is presented here.

Heritability estimates and genetic correlations
SNP heritability estimates by LDSC were estimated to be 28.67 % ± 6.65%. We analyzed crosstrait genetic correlations between PD and 750 other GWAS datasets of interest curated by LD
hub 15. No genetic correlations remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing via false
discovery rate. However, when considering an un-adjusted p-value < 0.05, negative correlations
were found for body mass index related traits, smoking and alcohol intake, and positive
correlations were identified for allergies and physical activity, among others (Supplementary
Table 5).

Runs of homozygosity
PD cases in our dataset were shown to have longer ROHs than controls, both with regard to the
percentage of the genome within these runs and the average run size. For every 10 Mb increase
in ROHs per sample, we noted an odds ratio of 1.02 (beta = 0.02, se = 0.008, p-value = 0.0097),
a small but significant increase. Average run size was also associated with PD risk at an odds
ratio of 1.244 per 1 Mb increase in average run size (beta = 0.218, se = 0.068, p-value = 0.0013).
The total numbers of these ROHs were not significantly different between cases and controls.
This suggests that fewer large ROHs might be more closely associated with disease risk than
many small ROHs.
We further explored extended runs of homozygosity in known Mendelian PD genes
(Supplementary Table 2) and the 90 nominated risk loci in the last meta-analysis 2.
Homozygosity was found enriched in cases versus controls at 28 genes/loci (Supplementary
Table 6). However, only a ROH in PARK2 surpassed Bonferroni correction (p-value threshold =
0.001).

Burden analyses
We explored the cumulative effect of multiple rare variants at a gene level by grouping them in
different categories based on frequency and functionality. We found a significant enrichment of
coding variants in the LRRK2 gene in PD cases compared to controls (p-value = 4.51E-16).
When we excluded p.G2019S carried by 2.8% of the PD subjects from the analysis, the risk of
PD conferred by LRRK2 is not significant (p-value=0.0611), suggesting that this variant is the
main driver of the association. Rare coding variants in PARK2 were found overrepresented in
cases versus controls (p-value = 0.008), although the association did not surpassed Bonferroni
correction (p-value threshold = 0.0002). When focusing only on non-coding variants, GBA
displayed an association at a p-value = 0.0003 which in this case did not reach multiple testing
correction (p-value threshold = 3.15E-6). Finally, when grouping the variants by CADD score,
we did not find any prospective novel gene associated with PD in the Spanish population.

Quantitative trait loci Mendelian randomization
After adjustment for false discovery rate, 17 PD-related genes/loci showed functional
consequence via two-sample Mendelian randomization in expression and methylation datasets
(Supplementary Table 7). Increased expression of NSF and BST1 in blood and KANSL1,
WNT3, KAT8, CD38, HLA-DRB6, TMEM175, HLA-DRB6 and CTSB in brain, were found to be
inversely associated with PD risk, while a positive risk association was found for TMEM163,
GAK, and HLA-DQA1 expression in brain. Disparate results were found across different probes
tagging DGK1.
Methylation QTL Mendelian randomization analyses revealed 56 CpG sites linked to PD risk in
brain after multiple test correction. Increased methylation of ARHGAP27, TMEM175, CRHR1
and GAK was found to be positively associated with disease while HLA-DRB5, IGSF9B,
TMEM163, DGKQ, showed a negative directionality versus PD risk. Disparate results were
found across different probes tagging KANSL1 and HLA-DRB5.

A total of 73 PD or parkinsonism variants annotated as possibly disease associated were
identified with higher frequencies in the PD patient sample (see Supplementary Table 8,
Supplementary Figure 6). Of the identified variants, 28.76% (21/73) were detected in genes
responsible for autosomal dominant PD. A total of 19 variants were detected in LRRK2; 2.8 %
(134/4,783) of the screened PD patients and 0.3 % (12/3,066) of the controls carry the LRRK2
p.G2019S mutation in the heterozygous state, while one case carried the variant in the
homozygous state (p = 2.73x10-15; OR = 8.05, se = 0.26). The LRRK2 p.Arg1441Gly
variant was identified in a case and the LRRK2 p.Met1869Thr was found in five cases and one
control.
Of the variants, 36.9 % (27/73) were identified within autosomal recessive PD genes, including
19 variants in PARK2 and 8 variants in PINK1. 15.78 % of the PARK2 cases carriers (18/114)
and 5.5 % of the PINK1 carriers were found in the homozygous state. Although NeuroChip was
not able to detect any PARK2 or PINK1 compound heterozygous carriers, exonic rearrangements
were detected in 0.96 % of the screened patients (Supplementary Figures 7A-B). PARK2
deletions were identified among 34 patients, 26 in the heterozygous state and 8 in the
homozygous. Duplications were identified in 12 patients.
17.8 % (13/73) of the variants were found in PD risk genes. Eleven GBA variants were detected
among (175/4,783) patients. The GBA p.His490Arg, p.Val437Ile, p.Gly234Glu, p.Val54Leu,
p.Lys13Arg, p.Leu29Alafs*18 and p.Leu363Pro variants were found overrepresented in cases
versus controls but the association analysis did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary
Table 8). A 1.1 % (53/4,783) of the patients and 0.3 % (12/3,066) of the controls under study
carry the GBA p.Asn409Ser mutation in the heterozygous state. A 2 % (97/4,783) of the cases
and 1.01 % (31/3,066) of the controls harbored the GBA p.Glu365Lys heterozygous
polymorphism (p = 0.0006; OR = 2.005, se = 0.2). The GBA p.Asp448His variant was
identified in 14 cases and 3 controls respectively (p = 0.07; OR = 2.99, se =0.6).
Furthermore, the previously reported p.Asn613del in MAPT was identified in a 87 year old
patient with an onset of rest tremor at 62 years and a notable family history of PD and
progressive supranuclear palsy 29. Finally, fourteen variants were found in four atypical
parkinsonism-related genes, including FBXO7 and POLG1 (autosomal recessive), as well as
ATP13A2 and DCTN1 (autosomal dominant), however, their disease significance is uncertain.

DISCUSSION

As part of a Spanish multicenter massive collaborative effort, we have gathered the largest
collection of PD patients and controls from a single country to comprehensively assess the
genetics of PD on a genome-wide scale. We have used the same genotyping platform, thus
reducing possible batch effects. Here, we dissect population-specific differences in risk and AAO
from a genetic perspective and highlight the utility of the Spanish risk haplotype substructure for
future fine-mapping efforts.
In concordance with other populations 2, our Spanish GWAS on PD risk replicated four loci
linked to disease, strengthening once again the role of SNCA, LRRK2, KANSL1/MAPT and HLADQB1 in disease etiology. Of note, we identified for the first time in an European population an
intronic signal in PARK2 as a modifier of AAO. Conditional analysis showed a likely dependent
effect with c.155delA, highlighting a higher frequency of this deleterious mutation in Spain
compared to other populations. Given the shared ancestry, c.155delA has been described at high
frequencies in the Iberian Peninsula 30,31 and has also been reported to be more common in the
Latino population (GnomAD allele count = 39/35,440; frequency = 0.11%) versus Non-Finnish
Europeans (GnomAD allele count =31/129,038; frequency = 0.024%).
Genetic testing can help to design an optimized trial with the highest likelihood of providing
meaningful and actionable answers. Our study shows that Spain is a valuable resource for
identifying and tracking PARK2 c.155delA carriers to accelerate enrollment for target-specific
PD clinical trials.
The fact that risk PD haplotypes are smaller in the Spanish population, in comparison to the less
admixed British population, brings to light the importance of exhaustively studying diverse
populations. The investigation of admixed populations in GWA studies has significant potential
to accelerate the mapping of PD loci.
Importantly, we revealed an overall excess of homozygosity in PD cases versus controls and
identified 28 genes/loci exhibiting ROH overrepresented in cases, pointing out the possible
existence of disease-causing recessive variants that might be uncovered by future sequencing

analysis. Additionally, burden analysis reinforced the contribution of both common and rare
variants in LRRK2, making Spain an important candidate population for specific LRRK2 clinical
trials. In an effort to explore functional consequences associated to PD risk in the Spanish
population, we performed quantitative trait loci Mendelian randomization analyses using
expression and methylation data and suggest biological pathways underlying the nominated
genes warrant further study.
Recent research has begun to demonstrate the utility of polygenic risk profiling to identify
individuals who could benefit from the knowledge of their probabilistic susceptibility to disease,
an aspect that is central to clinical decision-making and early disease detection 32. Here, we
assessed the overall cumulative contribution of common SNPs on disease risk and age at onset.
Our PRS derived model for disease risk and age at onset showed expected trends comparable to
previous literature 12,13,33.
While we have made progress in assessing genetic risk factors for PD in a population-specific
manner, there are a number of limitations to our study. First, although all the available PD cases
and controls from Spain have been assessed, we are aware of the caveats driven by sample size.
Dissection of additional susceptibility genetic risk and phenotypic relationships would have been
possible if a larger cohort had been analyzed. In fact, the heritability estimate, of ~ 28.67 % in
this population, indicates that there is a large component of genetic risk yet to be uncovered. We
assume there are a considerable number of variants that impact risk for disease outside the limits
of what can be accurately detected with a genotyping platform. This could explain the lower
observed frequency of certain well-established pathogenic variants and exonic rearrangements
when comparing other sequencing studies previously performed in the Spanish population 33,34.
We have applied a state-of-the-art machine learning approach in an effort to predict disease
status. Our results show that genetic data are not sufficient to accurately predict disease status in
a clinical setting by itself when used alone, although this may change in the future when
combining genetic with other biomarker data. Entering the era of personalized medicine in which
an individual's genetic makeup will help determine the most suitable therapy, we envisage our
collaborative initiative will expand towards identifying, refining, and predicting heritable risk in
the Spanish population by combining future large-scale whole-genome sequencing approaches,
multi-omics and detailed longitudinal clinical data for translational approaches. We conclude by

saying that this is the starting point of a collaborative network of Spanish clinicians and scientists
that will continue to pave the road towards future therapeutic interventions.
