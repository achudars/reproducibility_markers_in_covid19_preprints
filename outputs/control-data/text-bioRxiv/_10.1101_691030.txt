ABSTRACT

26
27

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a systemic disease clinically defined by the degeneration of

28

dopaminergic neurons in the brain. While alterations in the gut microbiome composition have

29

been reported in PD, their functional consequences remain unclear. Herein, we first analysed

30

the gut microbiome of patients and healthy controls by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stool

31

samples from the Luxembourg Parkinson’s study (n=147 typical PD cases, n=162 controls).

32

All individuals underwent detailed clinical assessment, including neurological examinations

33

and neuropsychological tests followed by self-reporting questionnaires. Second, we predicted

34

the potential secretion for 129 microbial metabolites through personalised metabolic modelling

35

using the microbiome data and genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human gut

36

microbes. Our key results include: 1. eight genera and nine species changed significantly in

37

their relative abundances between PD patients and healthy controls. 2. PD-associated microbial

38

patterns statistically depended on sex, age, BMI, and constipation. The relative abundances of

39

Bilophila and Paraprevotella were significantly associated with the Hoehn and Yahr staging

40

after controlling for the disease duration. In contrast, dopaminergic medication had no

41

detectable effect on the PD microbiome composition. 3. Personalised metabolic modelling of

42

the gut microbiomes revealed PD-associated metabolic patterns in secretion potential of nine

43

microbial metabolites in PD, including increased methionine and cysteinylglycine. The

44

microbial pantothenic acid production potential was linked to the presence of specific non-

45

motor symptoms and attributed to individual bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and

46

Bilophila wardswarthia. Our results suggest that PD-associated alterations of gut microbiome

47

could translate into functional differences affecting host metabolism and disease phenotype.

INTRODUCTION

51

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a complex multifactorial disease, with both genetic and

52

environmental factors contributing to the evolution and progression of the disease (Kalia et al.

53

2015). While several studies have elucidated the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of

54

the disease (Kitada et al. 1998; Bonifati et al. 2003; Paisan-Ruiz et al. 2004; Di Fonzo et al.

55

2009), the role and the contribution of various environmental and lifestyle factors are still not

56

completely understood (Gatto et al. 2010). Importantly, about 60% of the PD patients suffer

57

from constipation (Fasano et al. 2015), which can start up to 20 years before the diagnosis and

58

is one of the prodromal syndromes (Savica et al. 2009; Cersosimo et al. 2013).

59

The human being is considered to be a superorganism recognising a complex interplay

60

between the host and microbes (Sleator 2010). For instance, the human gut microbiome has

61

been shown to complement the host with essential functions (trophic, metabolic, protective)

62

and to influence the host’s central nervous system (CNS) via the gut-brain axis through the

63

modulation of neural pathways and GABAergic and serotoninergic signalling systems

64

(Carabotti et al. 2015).

65

Recent studies have reported an altered gut composition in PD (Hasegawa et al. 2015;

66

Keshavarzian et al. 2015; Scheperjans et al. 2015; Bedarf et al. 2017; Hill-Burns et al. 2017;

67

Hopfner et al. 2017; Petrov et al. 2017; Heintz-Buschart et al. 2018; Barichella et al. 2019).

68

One of these studies has been conducted using samples from recently diagnosed, drug-naive

69

patients (Bedarf et al. 2017). These studies have demonstrated that PD patients have an altered

70

microbiome composition, compared to age-matched controls. However, the functional

71

implications of the altered microbiome remain to be elucidated, e.g., using animal models

72

(Sampson et al. 2016). A complementary approach is computational modelling, or constraint-

73

based reconstruction and analyses (COBRA) (Orth et al. 2010), of microbiome-level

74

metabolism. In this approach, metabolic reconstructions for hundreds of gut microbes

75

(Magnusdottir et al. 2017) are combined based on microbiome data (Baldini et al. 2018;

76

Heirendt et al. 2019)). Flux balance analysis (FBA) (Orth et al. 2010) is then used to compute,

77

e.g., possible metabolite uptake or secretion flux rates of each microbiome model (microbiome

78

metabolic profile) (Heinken et al. 2019) or to study of microbial metabolic interactions (cross-

79

feedings) (Klitgord and Segre 2010; Heinken and Thiele 2015). This approach has been applied

80

to various microbiome data sets to gain functional insights (Thiele et al. 2018; Heinken et al.

81

2019; Hertel et al. in revision), including for PD where we propose that microbial sulphur

82

metabolism could contribute to changes in the blood metabolome of PD patients (Hertel et al.

83

in revision).

84

In the present study, we aim at investigating microbial changes associated with PD

85

while focusing on possible covariates influencing microbial composition and at proposing

86

functional, i.e., metabolic, consequences arising from the microbiome changes. First, we

87

analysed the faecal microbial composition of PD patients and controls from the Luxembourg

88

Parkinson’s study (Hipp et al. 2018) (Figure 1). Second, based on the observed significant

89

differences in the composition of microbial communities between PD patients and controls, we

90

created and interrogated personalised computational models representing the metabolism of

91

each individual’s microbial community. We demonstrate that the combined microbial

92

composition and functional metabolite analysis provides novel hypotheses on microbial

93

changes associated with PD and disease severity, enabling future mechanism-based

94

experiments.

RESULTS

97

The Luxembourg Parkinson’s Disease study includes patients with typical PD and

98

atypical parkinsonism, as well as matched healthy control subjects from Luxembourg and its

99

neighbouring regions from a broad age-range (Hipp et al. 2018). For the present study, we

Species and genus level changes in PD microbiomes

We investigated disease-associated microbial changes at the species level. We found

122

that the mean species diversity (i.e., the alpha-diversity) did not significantly differ between

123

PD cases and controls (b=-0.04351, 95%-CI:(-.107;0.177), p=0.177), in agreement with earlier

124

studies (Scheperjans et al. 2015; Bedarf et al. 2017) (Hopfner et al. 2017), but in disagreement

125

with two other studies (Keshavarzian et al. 2015; Heintz-Buschart et al. 2018). However, seven

126

species were significantly altered in PD (FDR<0.05, Figure 2). Note that when comparing

127

results between different taxonomic levels, changes observed for Ruminococcus and Roseburia

128

species were not significant on the genus level but only on the species level, highlighting the

129

importance of species-level resolution. The highest effect size was associated with

130

Akkermansia muciniphila (Odds ratio (OR)=1.80, 95%-CI=(1.29, 2.51), p=6.02e-04,

131

FDR<0.05; Supplementary Table 1) in agreement with the previously reported higher

132

abundance of A. muciniphila in PD patients (Bedarf et al. 2017; Heintz-Buschart et al. 2018)).

133

Subsequently, we examined possible differences at the genus level by performing

134

semiparametric fractional regressions while adjusting for age, sex, the body mass index (BMI),

135

batch, and total read counts. We identified eight genera to be significantly increased in PD

136

(FDR<0.05; Figure 3A, Table 1), with Lactobacillus showing the highest effect size (Odds

137

ratio (OR)=5.75, 95%-CI=(2.29, 14.45), p=1.96e-04, FDR<0.05; Supplementary Table 2). In

138

contrast, the genera Turicibacter decreased significantly in PD cases (FDR<0.05). To

139

summarise, significant changes could be observed on the species and genus level.

140
141

PD modifies the effects of basic covariates on the microbiome

142

Furthermore, we investigated whether the genus level alterations in PD were affected

143

by basic confounding factors. This interaction analyses uncovered rich effect modifications,

144

revealing that microbiome changes in PD have to be considered in the context of age, BMI,

145

and gender. Our analyses demonstrate that the effects of PD are not homogeneous among

146

important sub-groups of patients. For example, Paraprevotella was exclusively reduced in

147

female patients but not in female controls (Figure 3B), highlighting gender-dependent

148

alterations of microbial communities in PD. In addition, the effects of BMI and age were

149

modified in PD cases. The PD cases had increased Anaerotruncus abundance with age, while

150

non-linear, overall decreasing abundances of Roseburia and Paraprevotella were observed

151

with age and BMI, respectively (Figure 3C). Taken together, these analyses suggest that

152

microbial abundances are shifted in PD cases and that also the effects of important covariates

153

were altered in PD, reflecting the systemic and complex nature of PD.

Microbial abundances, medication intake, and constipation in PD

178

The Luxembourg Parkinson’s study enrols patients of all stages of PD. Therefore, the

179

patients have considerable inter-individual variance in PD-related features, such as constipation

180

and intake of medication (Table 1). We analysed whether these features had an impact the

181

microbiome composition in PD. In our data, we could not find any evidence for an effect of the

182

three medication types on the microbiome, i.e., levodopa, COMT inhibitors, or MAO-B

183

inhibitors, when correcting for multiple testing (Supplementary Table 2). In contrast,

184

constipation, a prevalent non-motor symptom in PD patients (Lesser 2002), was associated

185

with an increased abundance of Bifidobacterium, with a clear effect in constipated PD cases

186

(Figure 3D). However, since there were only ten constipated controls (Table 1), these results

187

must be confirmed in larger cohorts.

190

Genus association with the disease severity

191

We next investigated whether the stage of the disease, i.e., defined by Hoehn and Yahr

192

staging, NMS, and UPDRS (Unified Parkinson Rating Scale) scores, and its subscales, was

193

associated with altered genus abundance. For the Hoehn and Yahr staging, Paraprevotella

194

showed a negative association and Bilophila showed a positive association, both of which were

195

significant after multiple testing (Figure 3E). For the UPDRS III subscale score (i.e., motor

196

symptoms, Table 1), three genera, being Peptococcus, Flavonifractor, and Paraprevotella,

197

survived correction for multiple testing (Figure 3F). In contrast, the other UPDRS subscales

198

and the NMS were not significantly associated with microbial changes, after correction for

199

multiple testing. Note that these analyses were performed while adjusting for disease duration.

200

When analysing the association pattern of disease duration, we found Lactobacillus positively

201

correlated with the disease duration (FDR<0.05, Supplementary Figure S1). In conclusion, our

202

data suggest that the microbial composition may be utilised as a correlate of disease severity.

203
204

Metabolic modelling reveals distinct metabolic secretion capabilities of PD microbiomes

205

To obtain insight into the possible functional consequence of observed microbiome

206

changes in PD, we used metabolic modelling (cf. Methods). Briefly, we mapped each of the

207

309 microbiome samples on the generic microbial community model consisting of 819 gut

208

microbial reconstructions (Magnusdottir et al. 2017; Heinken et al. 2019) (cf. Supplementary

209

Material) to derived personalised microbiome models (Baldini et al. 2018). We then computed

210

a net maximal production capability (NMPC) for 129 different metabolites that could be

211

secreted by each microbial community model (cf. Methods), providing thereby a

212

characterisation of the differential microbial metabolic capabilities in PDs and controls. The

213

secretion of nine metabolites had differential NMPCs in PD (Figure 4A, all FDR<0.05) as

214

determined by multivariable regressions adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and technical covariates.

215

Moreover, although less dominant in comparison to the abundance data, PD-covariate

216

interactions were also prevalent, with the uracil secretion potential showing a sex-specific

217

effect and cysteine-glycine showing a BMI-dependent PD-effect (Figure 4B, 4C). In

218

subsequent analyses, we tested for associations of the NMPCs with constipation, medication,

219

disease duration, Hoehn-Yahr staging, NMS, and UPDRS III scores, complementing thereby

220

the analyses on the abundance level. Notably, we found xanthine, D-alanine, L-lactic acid, D-

221

ribose, and pantothenic acid positively associated with constipation (Figure 4B), while no

222

NMPC was associated with medication or with disease duration. However, the pantothenic acid

223

secretion potential was positively associated with higher NMS scores, interestingly both in PD

224

and in controls (Figure 4D), while no NMPC survived correction for multiple testing regarding

225

associations with the UPDRS III score and Hoehn-Yahr staging. To conclude, these results

226

suggest that the altered microbial composition in PD could result in broad changes in metabolic

227

capabilities, which manifested themselves additionally in non-motor symptoms and

228

constipation.

229
230

PD specific secretion profiles were altered due to changed community structure and

231

species abundances

232

Next, we analysed which microbes contributed to the differential secretion profiles by

233

correlating the NMPCs to the abundance data (Figure 4E/F, Supplementary Table 3). Six

234

metabolite NMPCs had strong contribution or where even dominated by single genera (Figure

235

4D), while for the other four NMPCs no single dominant genus could be identified. We then

236

computed the contribution value of each genus to the production of each secreted metabolite

237

(NMPC). From the aforementioned genera, which were associated on genus or species level

238

with PD, only Akkermansia, Acidaminococcus, and Roseburia had substantial metabolic

239

contributions (over 25%). Acidaminococcus was responsible for 64% of the variance in

DISCUSSION

262

In this study, we aimed to elucidate compositional and functional changes in the faecal

263

microbiome of PD patients. Therefore, we analysed 16S rRNA data from a cohort of typical

264

PD patients (n=147) and controls (n=162), and performed personalised microbial

265

computational modelling. We identified i) eight genera and nine species that changed

266

significantly in their relative abundances between PD patients and healthy controls. ii) PD-

267

associated microbial patterns that were dependent on sex, age, BMI, constipation, and iii) in

268

PD patients altered secretion potentials, particularly in sulphur metabolism, using metabolic

269

modelling of microbial communities. Overall, our work demonstrated compositional and

270

functional differences in the gut microbial communities of Parkinson’s disease patients

271

providing novel experimentally testable hypothesis related to PD pathogenesis.

272

The microbial compositional analyses of our cohort identified significantly different

273

microbial abundance distributions between PD patients and healthy controls (Table 1). Up to

274

date, 13 studies have described altered colonic microbial compositions associated with PD and

275

an overall picture starts to arise (Figure 5). For instance, the microbial the families of

276

Verrucomicrobiaceae and Lactobacillaceae have been consistently found to have an increased

277

abundance in PD (Figure 5). In accordance, our study also reports increased abundance in PD

278

of Akkermansia, Christensenella, and Lactobacillus. Similarly, Bifidobacteria has also been

279

repeatedly associated with PD (Figure 5) but in our study, we could show that the

280

Bifidobacteria association dependent on constipation (Figure 3) highlighting the need for

281

incorporating disease-specific phenotypes as covariates into the statistical design.

293

At the same time, inconsistencies between the studies remain and they may be due to

294

differences in study design, inclusion criteria, faecal sampling, RNA extraction protocols, and

295

metagenomic and statistical methods. For instance, we used a relatively large, PD cohort while

296

Bedarf and colleagues (Bedarf et al. 2017) studied a small cohort of drug-naïve, male PD

297

patients and male controls (Figure 5). Three studies included individuals of Chinese descent

298

(Li et al. 2017; Lin et al. 2018; Qian et al. 2018) while the other studies focused on Caucasian

299

individuals. It has been shown that microbial composition is associated with ethnic

300

background, geography, and dietary habits (Turnbaugh et al. 2008; De Filippo et al. 2010;

301

Yatsunenko et al. 2012), which may explain some of the discrepancies. The differences

302

between the studies hence highlight the importance of performing meta-analysis to identify

303

global microbial signatures, as it has been done for, e.g., colorectal cancer (Wirbel et al. 2019).

304

Such meta-analysis may also permit to investigate subgroups of PD, as the number of cases

305

and controls would be substantially increased and thus provide higher statistical power. For

306

instance, we observed various effect modulators that were not reported before in humans (Table

307

1), such as Paraprevotella abundance reduction being specific to women. This result is

308

apparently in contradiction with findings from Bedarf and colleagues (Bedarf et al. 2017) who

309

reported decreased levels of Prevotellaceae in a cohort of only male PD patients. However,

310

once again, differences might be explained by different inclusion criteria, methodologies, and

311

related possible sex-specific effects. Interestingly, a recent study reported a higher abundance

312

of Paraprevotella in male mice compared to female mice (Huang et al. 2018). Despite the lack

313

of extensive studies on gender-specific differences in microbiome composition, we suggest that

314

machine learning procedures on microbiome data should be performed in a sex-stratified

315

manner. Larger cohorts, e.g., through meta-analysis of published cohorts would allow the

316

identification of generalizable microbial differences in PD patients and also, specific microbial

317

changes associated with certain traits and physiological characteristics, as suggested by our

318

data.

319

We could not detect an effect of the dopaminergic, PD specific medication on the

320

microbiome composition, after correction for multiple testing. Also the fact that key findings

16

321

from the study of Bedarf and colleagues were reproduced in other cohorts of PD patients under

322

medication, including ours, support that notion. Nonetheless, in previous studies, Dorea and

323

Phascolarctobacterium genera have been negatively associated with levodopa equivalent doses

324

(Qian et al. 2018) and members of the family of Bacillaceae have been correlated with

325

levodopa treatment (Heintz-Buschart et al. 2018). Consequently, it cannot be excluded that

326

medication is associated with microbial changes, albeit the association may be weaker than the

327

effects of other covariates. As PD drugs are often taken in combinations, it would require a

328

larger sample size than used in our study to permit the investigation of all possible drug

329

combinations. The lack of clear association is somewhat expected as levodopa is absorbed in

330

the upper part of the small intestine (Streubel et al. 2006) and thus small intestinal rather than

331

large intestinal microbes may play a more prominent role in levodopa bioavailability.

332

Consistently, a recent study showed that bacterial tyrosine decarboxylases restrict the

333

bioavailability of levodopa (van Kessel et al. 2019). Interestingly, 193/818 reconstructed

334

microbes (Magnusdottir et al. 2017), commonly found in the human gut, carry genes encoding

335

for proteins that convert levodopa into dopamine (Noronha et al. 2019). Levodopa is always

336

given with decarboxylase inhibitors, such as carbidopa or benserazide, targeting the human

337

decarboxylases, but it cannot be excluded that they also act on the microbial counterpart.

338

However, Van Kessel et al. have shown that carbidopa as well as benserazide is only a weak

339

inhibitor of the microbial tyrosine decarboxylase (van Kessel et al. 2019).

340

We identified a positive association of Bilophila abundance with the Hoehn and Yahr

341

staging, which captures motor impairment and disability independent of disease duration.

342

Indeed, the abundance of Bilophila was not associate with disease duration, indicating mainly

343

dependency on the progression of symptoms. This finding is consistent with experimental mice

344

studies demonstrating the pro-inflammatory effect of Bilophila overgrowth (Devkota et al.

345

2012; Natividad et al. 2018). Notably, the Hoehn and Yahr staging was also positively

346

associated on a nominal level with the predicted pyruvate secretion profile (Supplementary File

347

4), which was accordingly significantly increased in PD patients on a nominal level alongside

348

with L- and D-alanine. Bilophila has the rare capability to use taurine, an inhibitory

349

neurotransmitter with neuroprotective effects (Saransaari and Oja 2007; Wu et al. 2009), as an

350

energy source (Laue and Cook 2000). This pathway is initiated by the taurine: pyruvate

351

aminotransferase (Laue and Cook 2000), converting pyruvate and taurine into L-alanine and

352

sulfoacetaldehyde. The only microbe of the 818 species in our AGORA collection encoding

353

the corresponding gene was Bilophila, which was significantly increased (FDR<0.05) and

354

hence, the corresponding reaction (VMH ID: TAURPYRAT) was increased in abundance in

355

PD microbiomes as well. In a previous study (Hertel et al. in revision), we have shown that

356

blood taurine conjugated bile acids were positively associated with motor symptoms. Bilophila

357

may be a marker of disease progression in PD, and it could modulate human sulphur

358

metabolism through its taurine degradation capabilities. Alterations in sulphur metabolism

359

have been already described when using computational modelling of microbiomes from a

360

cohort of early diagnosed and levodopa naive PD patients (Bedarf et al. 2017; Hertel et al. in

361

revision) as well as an increased concentration of methionine and derived metabolites in blood

362

samples (Hertel et al. in revision). Furthermore, we and others have reported alterations in bile

363

acids and taurine-conjugated bile acids in PD patients (Graham et al. 2018; Hertel et al. in

364

revision). Our present study suggests again a key role of Bilophila in host-microbiome sulphur

365

co-metabolism, which may link with bile acid metabolism.

366

Interestingly, an increased abundance of B. wadsworthia has been linked to constipation

367

(Vandeputte et al. 2017). B. wadsworthia is the only microbe in the AGORA collection capable

368

of the metabolic reaction converting pyruvate and taurine to L-alanine and sulphoacetaldehyde

369

(VMH ID: TAURPYRAT). Therefore, an increased production of L-alanine might be due to

370

the increased B. wadsworthia abundance. This resulting higher production rate of L-alanine

18

371

could then lead to an increased conversion into D-alanine via the alanine racemase (VMH ID:

372

ALAR), which was present in 808/818 gut microbes in the AGORA collection. Accordingly,

373

D-alanine was one of the three metabolite secretion profiles increased in constipated PD

374

patients (Figure 4E). This hypothesis of B. wadsworthia playing a role in constipation of PD

375

patients would need to be experimentally validated, especially since we could not find

376

statistically significant changes in the association between the abundance of B. wadsworthia

377

and constipated individuals. In contrast, we found an increase in Bifidobacteria abundance in

378

constipated individuals and particularly in constipated PD patients. This result disagreed with

379

an earlier study on individuals with chronic constipation, which reported a decrease in

380

Bifidobacteria abundance (Khalif et al. 2005). Overall, the available data suggest that complex

381

alterations in microbial composition are associated with constipation but may differ between

382

diseases.

383

The mucin degrading microbe, A. muciniphila, represents about 1-4% of the faecal

384

microbiome in humans (Naito et al. 2018). Numerous diseases have been associated with a

385

decrease in A. muciniphila abundance (Schneeberger et al. 2015; Grander et al. 2018), while

386

an increase has been consistently reported in PD patients (Figure 5). The A. muciniphila

387

abundance had the largest contribution to the significantly altered metabolite secretion profiles

388

(Figure 4E), including the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). While its

389

predicted secretion potential was only nominally increased in PD patients the present study,

390

higher GABA secretions rates have also been predicted based on microbiome data from early

391

stage levodopa naive PD patients (Hertel et al. in revision). Importantly, GABA receptors have

392

been found in the enteric nervous system, gut muscle, gut epithelial layers, and endocrine-like

393

cells (Hyland and Cryan 2010) and its gut receptors are thought to be related to gastric motility

394

(peristalsis), gastric emptying, and acid secretion (Hyland and Cryan 2010). Experiments with

395

the GABAb agonist baclofen have shown that GABAb receptors can reduce gastric mobility

19

396

in the colon of rabbits (via cholinergic modulation) (Tonini et al. 1989). Interestingly, A.

397

muciniphila has been shown to be positively associated with gastrointestinal transit time

398

(Gobert et al. 2016; Vandeputte et al. 2016). GABA could reach the CNS via blood stream as

399

a lipophilic compound, being able to pass the blood brain barrier. Additionally, microbial

400

GABA could affect the brain-gut axis by contributing the human GABA pools, especially as it

401

has been shown that the microbiome can affect GABA receptor density in the CNS via the

402

vagus nerve (Bravo et al. 2011). To establish whether and which role A. muciniphila and GABA

403

may play a role in prodomal PD, further experimental studies will be required.

404

In order to move beyond mere cataloguing of microbial changes associated with

405

diseases, pathway-based tools (Abubucker et al. 2012) have been developed, in which

406

microbial sequences (or reads) are mapped, e.g., onto KEGG ontologies present in the KEGG

407

database (Kanehisa et al. 2017). Using such tools, Bedarf et al reported decreased glucuronate

408

degradation and an increase in tryptophan degradation and formate conversion (Bedarf et al.

409

2017). Similarly, Heinz-Buschart et al. reported 26 KEGG pathways to be altered in PD

410

microbiomes (Heintz-Buschart et al. 2018). In our study, we complemented the compositional

411

analysis with computational modelling to gain insight into potential functional, i.e., metabolic,

412

consequences of changed microbe abundances in PD. The advantage of our approach is that

413

the functional assignments may be more comprehensive than more canonical methods, such as

414

KEGG ontologies because (1) the underlying genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have

415

been assembled based on refined genome annotations and have been manually curated to

416

ensure that the reaction and gene content is consistent with current knowledge about the

417

microbe’s physiology, and (2) each of these reconstructions, alone or in combinations, are

418

amenable to metabolic modelling and thus functional and metabolic consequences of a changed

419

environment (e.g., nutrients or other microbes in the models) can be computed. These

420

simulations are thus allowing to predict functional consequences and not only pathway or

421

reaction enrichment, as typically done.

422
423

Strength and limitation

424

Here, we present microbiome analyses in a large population-based, monocentric case-

425

control study on PD from a defined area (Figure 5). Capitalising on the overall clinical spectrum

426

of PD of the LuxPark cohort, which reflects a representative sample of PD patients of different

427

disease stages from a defined geographical area, we demonstrated that microbial composition

428

is not only altered in PD but also that the observed associations of PD with changes in the

429

composition of the microbiome should be interpreted in the context of age, sex, BMI, and

430

constipation. This information is of importance for clinical translation, highlighting the need

431

for both, (i) a personalised and (ii) a holistic approach, to understand the role of microbial

432

communities in PD pathogenesis. In a second step targeting the potential functional changes

433

related to PD-associated microbiomes, we performed metabolic modelling based on the

434

AGORA collection (Magnusdottir et al. 2017) of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions,

435

allowing for the predictions of metabolite secretion profiles. Thus, our analyses facilitated a

436

detailed investigation of the altered metabolism of PD-related microbial communities in the

437

gut, pointing towards a role of the known pro-inflammatory species B. wadsworthia interacting

438

with the host on sulphur metabolism. Hence, metabolic modelling provides a valuable tool for

439

deciphering the metabolic activity of microbial communities in PD.

440

However, despite the partial confirmation of previous results by our study (Table 5),

441

several limitations should be kept in mind. First, certain covariates were not investigated, such

442

as diet, exercise, and smoking. Whether these covariates alter the PD-specific signature is yet

443

to be analysed. Although our study belongs to the three largest studies performed yet on PD,

444

our sample size was still too small to deliver insights on combinations of drugs. Furthermore,

21

445

16S RNA sequencing, as applied in our study, is not allowing analyses on the strain level and

446

may lead to misclassifications (Janda and Abbott 2007), and follow-up studies based on

447

shotgun sequencing are needed to further corroborate our results. However, our results are

448

notably well aligned with a previous shotgun sequencing study (Bedarf et al. 2017), which

449

would further support a role of 16S RNA sequencing as a cost-efficient screening method.

450

Being cross-sectional in nature, causal inference is not possible. Consequently, although

451

metabolic modelling has been numerous times been shown to correctly predict attributes of

452

living systems (Oberhardt et al. 2009; Aurich and Thiele 2016; Nielsen 2017), our hypothesis

453

on the role of B. wadsworthia in PD interlinking sulphur metabolism with disease severity

454

requires experimental validation. To conclude, by combining metabolic modelling with

455

comprehensive statistical analyses, we identified a promising research target in PD and refined

456

the understanding of PD-related microbial changes.

METHODS

459

Description of the Luxembourg Parkinson’s study

460

For this study, data and biospecimen of the LuxPark cohort were utilised (Hipp et al.

461

2018). The Luxembourg Parkinson’s study includes a variegated group of patients with typical

462

PD and atypical parkinsonism, and controls from Luxembourg and its neighbouring regions

463

(Hipp et al. 2018). Controls were partly sampled among relatives of patients. The

464

corresponding information on the family relation between controls and cases was not available.

465

Cancer diagnosis with ongoing treatment, pregnancy, and secondary parkinsonism (drug-

466

induced parkinsonism and parkinsonism in the frame of normotensive hydrocephalus) were

467

exclusion criteria for enrolling in the patient or healthy control group. For 454 individuals

468

(controls: n=248, PD: n=206) from the LuxPark cohort, stool samples were available and used

469

for 16S RNA gene sequencing data (see below). Within LuxPark, controls were selected among

470

spouses of chosen patients and volunteers and individuals from other independent

471

Luxembourgish studies (Crichton and Alkerwi 2014; Ruiz-Castell et al. 2016). As we aimed to

472

target specifically typical PD (IPD), we excluded all individuals with age below 50 (controls:

473

n=47, PD: n=9) and all individuals with an unclear status of PD diagnosis or an atypical PD

474

diagnosis (PD: n=47). PD patients were defined as typical PD, according to the inclusion

475

criteria by the United Kingdom Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic

476

Criteria (Hughes et al. 1992). Furthermore, we excluded control patients with a United

477

Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III score above ten, except for one control where

478

the high UPDRS III score was caused by an arm injury. Furthermore, we excluded control

479

persons who took dopaminergic medications (n=5), and individuals who reported to have taken

480

antibiotics in the last six months (controls: n=20, PD: n=13). Note that excluded observations

481

behave sub-additive, because of overlap between the exclusion criteria (i.e. individuals below

482

age 50 and taking antibiotics). Finally, 309 individuals (controls: n=162, cases: n=147) were

483

included in the statistical analyses.

484

All study participants gave written informed consents, and the study was performed in

485

accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The LuxPark study (Hipp et al. 2018) was

486

approved by the National Ethics Board (CNER Ref: 201407/13) and Data Protection

487

Committee (CNPD Ref: 446/2017).

Measurements and neuropsychiatric testing

490

All patients and healthy controls were assessed by a neurologist, neuropsychologist or

491

trained study nurse during the comprehensive battery of clinical assessment. Olfaction testing

492

rating scales I-IV were used (Goetz et al. 2008). The severity of the disease was reflected by

496

the Hoehn and Yahr staging (Hoehn and Yahr 1967). Non-motor symptoms were measured via

497

the NMS questionnaire (Romenets et al. 2012). The use of medication was recorded, and PD-

498

specific medication was classified into three classes, 1) levodopa, 2) dopamine receptor

499

agonist, and 3) MAO-B/COMT inhibitors.

Collection and processing of stool samples

502

All samples were processed following standard operating procedures (Lehmann et al.

503

2012; Mathay et al. 2015): stool samples were collected at home by patients using the

504

OMNIgene.GUT stool tubes (DNA Genotek) and sent to the Integrated Biobank Luxembourg

505

(IBBL) where one aliquot of 1 ml was used for DNA extraction. For the DNA extraction, a

506

modified Chemagic DNA blood protocol was used with the MSM I instrument (PerkinElmer),

507

the Chemagic Blood kit special 4 ml (Ref. CMG-1074) with a lysis buffer for faecal samples,

508

and MSM I software. Samples were lysed using the SEB lysis buffer (included in the kit) and

509

vortexed to obtain a homogenous suspension that was incubated for 10min at 70°C, then 5min

510

at 95°C. Lysates (1.5mL) were centrifuged for five minutes at 10,000 g at RT. Supernatants

511

were transferred to a 24XL deep-well plate. Plates were processed using the MSM I automated

512

protocol.

Analysis of the microbial composition with 16S rRNA gene sequencing

515

The V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA were sequenced at IBBL using an Illumina

516

Platform (Illumina MiSeq) using 2x300bp paired-end reads (Hipp et al. 2018). The gene-

517

specific primers targeted the V3 - V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. These primers were

518

designed with Illumina overhang adapters and used to amplify templates from genomic DNA.

519

Amplicons were generated, cleaned, indexed, and sequenced according to the Illumina-

demonstrated 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation Protocol with certain

521

modifications. In brief, an initial PCR reaction contained at least 12.5 ng of DNA. A subsequent

522

limited-cycle amplification step was performed to add multiplexing indices and Illumina

523

sequencing adapters. Libraries were normalised, pooled, and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq

524

system using 2x300 bp paired-end reads.

525

The demultiplexed samples were processed merging forward and reverse reads and

526

quality filtered using the dedicated pipeline "Merging and Filtering tool (MeFit)" (Parikh et al.

527

2016) with default parameters. To obtain a reliable microbial identification, identification to

528

both genus and species taxonomic level was obtained using the SPINGO (SPecies level

529

IdentificatioN of metaGenOmic amplicons) classifier (Allard et al. 2015) with default

530

parameters. Relative abundances were computed, for each sample, using an R (R Foundation

531

for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996) custom script. Briefly,

532

for each sample, the counts of each genera/species were retrieved, and then the sum of the

533

counts of all the genera/species was used to normalise to a total value of 1 each genera/species

534

count.

536

Personalised constraint-based modelling of microbial communities

537

AGORA consists of a set of 819 strains of microbes commonly found in the human gut

538

(Magnusdottir et al. 2017; Noronha et al. 2019). To match species taxonomic resolution, we

539

combined strain models of the same species in one species model (‘panSpeciesModel.m’) using

540

the function ‘createPanModels.m’ of the microbiome modelling toolbox (Baldini et al. 2018).

541

Briefly, reactions of multiple strains are combined into one pan-reconstruction. The pan-

542

biomass reaction is built from the average of all strain-specific biomass reactions. Microbial

543

abundances were mapped onto a set of 646 species performing an automatic name matching

544

between SPINGO species taxonomic assignment and panSpecies names. A threshold for

545

assessing the bacterial presence of a relative abundance value of 0.0001 was used to reduce the

546

time of computations while limiting the order of magnitude simulations results of

547

stoichiometric coefficients to ten. A total of 259 species overlapped between our set of species

548

models and SPINGO species assignment when considering species identified at least in 10 %

549

of samples (Supplementary Material). The retrieved microbial abundance information for each

550

sample was integrated into a community modelling setup obtaining personalised microbiome

551

models using the automated module of the microbiome modelling toolbox (Baldini et al. 2018)

552

called

553

b097185b641fc783fa6fea4900bdd303643a6a7e). Briefly, the metabolic models of the

554

community members are connected by a common compartment, where each model can

555

secrete/uptake metabolites. An average European diet was set as input for each microbiome

556

model (Noronha et al. 2019). A community objective function was formulated based on the

557

sum of each microbial model objective function and constrained to a lower bound of 0.4 per

558

day and upper bound of one per day. A set of exchange reactions connects the shared

559

compartment to the environment enabling to predict metabolite uptake and secretion flux rates

560

(metabolic profiles/NMPCs) consistent with the applied constraints. The personalisation of

561

each microbiome model was achieved by adjusting stoichiometric coefficients in the

562

community biomass reactions to each sample’s relative microbial abundance and removing

563

species undetected from the community models.

IBM CPLEX (IBM, Inc.) solver through the Tomlab (Tomlab, Inc.) interface.

573

Analyses of relative abundances

574

For descriptive statistics, metric variables were described by means and standard

575

deviations, while nominal variables were described by proportions. Missing values were not

576

imputed, and the pattern of missing values was not assessable via the ADA platform (Hipp et

577

al. 2018). The read counts for each metagenomic feature (e.g., genera and species) were divided

578

by total read counts such that relative abundances were retrieved. Relative abundances were

579

checked for outliers. Observations with more than four standard deviations from the mean were

580

excluded from analyses. Only genera and species detected in more than 50% of all samples

581

were included in the analyses, resulting in 62 genera and 127 species.

582
583

The metagenomic data was analysed using fractional regressions as developed by

584

(Papke and Wooldridge 1996). Fractional regressions, first applied to econometric problems,

585

are semiparametric methods designed to model fractional data without the need of specifying

586

the distribution of the response variable. Fractional regressions are further inherently robust

587

against heteroscedasticity and can be parametrised in odds ratios, delivering convenient

588

interpretations of the regression coefficients. All statistical models included technical

589

covariates, batch, total read counts, and unclassified read counts (reads for which a taxonomic

590

assignment was not possible independently from any threshold of confidence estimate value

591

used). The read count variables were included into the statistical model, as it has been shown

592

that normalisation by division can introduce bias if certain statistical assumptions implied by

593

the application of division are not fulfilled (Hertel et al. 2018). In the case of metagenomic

594

data, the effect of read counts would be removed by division if the observations would be

595

sampled from a multinomial distribution. However, this is not a given as species and genera

596

correlate amongst each other, violating the assumptions needed to construct multinomial

597

distributions. In consequence, read count normalisation by division is prone to introduce a bias

598

into metagenomic data; a potential bias, we corrected for by including the read counts as

599

covariates into the model.

600

Before fitting the final statistical models, we explored the associations of basic

601

covariates (age, sex, and BMI) with metagenomic features using fractional regressions as

602

described above to avoid misspecifications of the statistical models. Since the data showed a

603

high range in age and BMI, we checked for potential non-linear associations by including these

604

variables into the models as restricted cubic splines (Harrell 2001) using three knots defined

605

by the 5%-percentile, the median, and the 95%-percentile. As in the case for age, we found

606

species with indications of non-linear age-associations with p<0.01, age was modelled in all

607

analyses via restricted cubic splines.

608

All p-values are reported two-tailed. Statistical analyses were performed in STATA

609

14/MP (College Station, Texas, USA). Summary statistics of the performed analyses are given

610

in the Supplementary files ‘Supplementary Tables’ 1-4.

Differences between PD and controls in microbial composition and the influence of

613

covariates

614

To analyse difference between genus abundances between PD and controls, fractional

615

regressions were carried out with the relative abundance of the genus as the response variable,

616

while including technical covariates, age (restricted cubic splines), sex, and BMI into the

617

statistical modelling. The predictor of interest was the study group indicator variable. We

618

corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Benjamini 2010) by

619

setting the false discovery rate (FDR) to 0.05. Consequently, we corrected for 62 tests when

620

reporting genera results. These analyses were repeated analogously for the taxonomic level of

621

species, while correcting for multiple testing via the FDR.

622

Next, we explored the possibility of statistical interactions between basic covariates

623

(age, sex, and BMI) and the group indicator. For these analyses, we once again modelled age

624

and BMI via restricted cubic splines allowing for non-linear interaction terms. We only tested

625

two-way interaction terms. All interaction terms were introduced simultaneously into the

626

statistical model and tested on significance via a Wald test (Harrell 2001), correcting for

627

multiple testing via the FDR. For the globally significant test, the single interaction terms were

628

investigated to explore which covariate-group interaction contributed to the overall

629

significance. For interpretation, the interaction terms were visually inspected by plotting the

630

predictions conditional on technical covariates. These analyses were then rerun with species

631

abundances as response variable instead of genus abundances.

632

We assessed the influence of constipation on the microbial composition. We introduced

633

the binary predictor constipation (yes/no) as additional predictor into the model and the

634

corresponding group-constipation interaction term. Both terms were tested simultaneously on

635

zero with a Wald test. The analyses were once again adjusted for technical covariates, age

636

(restricted cubic splines), sex, and BMI, and we corrected for multiple testing via the FDR.

637
638

Analyses of within PD phenotypes in relation to microbial composition

639

We investigated the association pattern of medication and clinical features regarding

640

the microbial composition. These analyses were only performed on the IPD cases, while

641

controls were excluded from the analyses. First, we analysed the disease duration as measured

642

in years between the date of the stool sampling and the year of the diagnosis. The analyses were

643

conducted as before via fractional regressions with the genus abundances as the response

644

variable, while adjusting for technical covariates, age (restricted cubic splines), sex, and BMI.

645

Then, we assessed in separate analyses the UPDRS III score as an indicator for motor

646

symptoms, the non-motor symptoms as measured by the NMS, the Hoehn-Yahr staging of the

647

disease as a global measure of disease progression, and the sniff-score. All these analyses were

648

performed adjusted for technical covariates, age (restricted cubic splines), sex, BMI, and

649

disease duration. Each of these series of regression represents 62 test, which was accounted for

650

using the FDR. The impact of medication was analysed by examining three classes of

651

medication, a) levodopa, b) mono-amino oxidase/catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, and

652

c) dopamine receptor agonists. We generated three corresponding binary phenotypes (intake/no

653

intake) and added these three variables simultaneously to the statistical model determining the

654

significance of this add-on via a Wald test. We then tested each medication-class in separate

655

analyses, strictly correcting for multiple testing via the FDR (186 tests in total). The analyses

656

were performed adjusted for technical covariates, age (restricted cubic splines), sex, BMI, and

657

disease duration.

658
659

Statistical analyses of fluxes

660

The NMPCs were log transformed such that the skewness of the distribution was

661

minimised (Box and Cox 1964)). This type of transformation was applied because of the very

662

differently skewed distributions of the single NMPCs. Then, outliers were excluded using the

663

4-SD outlier rule as before. Only fluxes with more than 50% non-zero values were retained in

664

analyses. Furthermore, NMPCs with distributions not suitable for statistical analyses (e.g.,

665

distributions with a high number of observations with exact the same numerical value) were

666

excluded resulting in 129 NMPCs included into analyses.

667

The NMPCs were analysed with mixed linear regressions including the batch as random

668

effects. Including the batch variable as a random effect has a higher statistical power in

669

comparison to the fixed effect approach, but relies on more restrictive assumptions. We tested

670

the corresponding random effect assumption by Hausman specification tests and found no

671

indications of violations of the Hausman specification test. Note that this possibility to account

672

for batch effects via random effects is not available with fractional regressions where batch

673

effects were corrected via fixed effects.

674

We performed the same analyses as with the metagenomic data, with the sole exception

675

of replacing the fractional regression model with the linear mixed model. In all other aspects,

676

the analyses followed the same scheme.

677
678

Analyses of species contribution to fluxes

679

To investigate the contribution of species and genera, we calculated for all included

680

genera and all analysed fluxes the pairwise correlation and the corresponding variance

681

contribution (the squared correlation). We classified every correlation above 0.5 (equal to 25%

682

of variance contribution) as a strong correlation in accordance with classical classifications of

683

effect size (Cohen 1988).
