Abstract

15

Metabolic engineering can be used as a powerful tool to redirect cell resources towards product

16

synthesis, also in conditions that are not optimal. An example of a synthesis pathway strongly

17

dependent on external conditions is the production of storage lipids, which typically requires

18

high carbon/nitrogen ratio. Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 is known for its ability to produce

19

industrially interesting storage lipids, namely wax esters (WEs). Here, we engineered the central

20

carbon metabolism of A. baylyi ADP1 by deletion of the gene aceA encoding for isocitrate lyase

21

in order to allow redirection of carbon towards WEs. The production was further enhanced by

22

overexpression of fatty acyl-CoA reductase Acr1 in the wax ester production pathway. This

23

strategy led to 3-fold improvement in yield (0.075 g/g glucose) and 3.15-fold improvement in

24

titer (1.82 g/L) and productivity (0.038 g/L/h) by a simple one-stage batch cultivation with

25

glucose as carbon source. The engineered strain accumulated up to 27% WEs of cell dry weight.

26

The titer and cellular WE content are the highest reported to date among microbes. We further

27

showed that the engineering strategy alleviated the inherent requirement for high carbon/nitrogen

28

ratio and demonstrated the production of wax esters using nitrogen-rich substrates including

29

casamino acids, yeast extract and baker’s yeast hydrolysate, which support biomass production

30

but not WE production in wild-type cells. The study demonstrates the power of metabolic

31

engineering in overcoming natural limitations in the production of storage lipids.

1. Introduction

38

Metabolic engineering provides a powerful tool for improving the production of industrially

39

relevant products using microbial cells as factories (Pfleger et al., 2015). One potential approach

40

is to optimize the distribution of carbon and cellular resources between biomass and product

41

synthesis, which is a common challenge in microbial production. Microbial storage lipid

42

production represents a typical example of a synthesis route which strongly competes with

43

biomass production. To induce lipid accumulation, excess of carbon along with the limitation of

44

some key nutrients, typically nitrogen, is required (Breuer et al., 2012; Garay et al., 2014;

45

Wältermann and Steinbüchel, 2005). Therefore, the production process is typically divided into

46

two phases, where biomass is accumulated in the first phase and the lipid accumulation is

47

induced in the second phase by limiting nitrogen availability while sustaining high carbon

48

substrate concentration. However, such approach can result in low overall productivity. In

49

addition, nitrogen limitation may not be suitable for cells (over)expressing non-native activities

50

and pathways. One strategy to manipulate the distribution of carbon and energy between biomass

51

and product synthesis is to directly engineer the central carbon metabolism. However, deletion of

52

key genes in central metabolism may harm cell functions and strongly reduce growth, which can

53

negatively affect production. Thus, in previous studies, various strategies for dynamic control of

54

enzyme levels in central metabolism have been introduced. For example, Soma et al. increased

55

the availability of acetyl-CoA from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for isopropanol

56

production by conditionally switching off the expression of citrate synthase (Soma et al., 2014).

57

In another example, Doong et al. improved the production of glucaric acid by dynamically down-

58

regulating an essential enzyme in the competing glycolytic pathway based on quorum sensing,

59

and up-regulating a downstream enzyme upon the production of its intermediate (Doong et al.,

60

2018). More recently, Santala et al. established autonomous downregulation of the glyoxylate

61

cycle based on the gradual oxidation of the inducer arabinose, enabling a shift from biomass

62

formation to lipid accumulation (Santala et al., 2018).

63

Wax esters (WEs) are an example of high-value storage lipids, which could be used in a broad

64

range of applications, including cosmetics, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, printing, food industries,

65

etc. (Sánchez et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2007). Acinetobacter sp. is the best known

66

microorganism for producing long-chain WEs as energy and storage compounds (Fixter et al.,

67

1986; Rontani, 2010). In addition, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, is an ideal cellular platform for

68

synthetic biology and metabolic engineering due to its genetic tractability (de Berardinis et al.,

69

2008; Metzgar, 2004; Murin et al., 2012; Suárez et al., 2017; Tumen-Velasquez et al., 2018),

70

thus enabling it to be a suitable host to study storage lipid production (Santala et al., 2014).

71

Besides WEs, A. baylyi ADP1 has also been engineered to produce various native and non-native

72

oleochemicals, such as alkanes, alkenes, and triacylglycerols (Lehtinen et al., 2018b; Luo et al.,

73

2019; Salmela et al., 2019; Santala et al., 2011b).

74

Fatty acid synthesis pathway provides the precursors fatty acyl-CoAs (coenzyme A) for the

75

synthesis of WEs (Janßen and Steinbüchel, 2014). The pathway produces fatty acyl-ACPs (acyl

76

carrier protein) as products by iterative enzymatic reaction cycles, starting with the central

77

metabolic intermediate, acetyl-CoA. In Acinetobacter sp., the resulting fatty acyl-ACPs are

78

further converted to fatty acyl-CoAs, followed by three enzymatic reactions involved in WE

79

synthesis: (1) reduction of fatty acyl-CoAs to fatty aldehydes by the fatty acyl-CoA reductase

80

Acr1 (Reiser and Somerville, 1997), (2) reduction of the fatty aldehydes to fatty alcohols by an

81

uncharacterized enzyme and (3) esterification between the fatty alcohols and the fatty acyl-CoAs

82

by a bifunctional wax ester synthase/diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT) (Kalscheuer

83

and Steinbüchel, 2003). The glyoxylate cycle, which widely exists in bacteria, hypothetically

84

competes with fatty acid synthesis pathway for acetyl-CoA (Figure 1A). Unlike the complete

85

TCA cycle, glyoxylate cycle bypasses two oxidative steps that release two molecules of carbon

86

dioxide (Kornberg, 1966). Thus, one important role of the glyoxylate cycle is to replenish the

87

intermediates in the TCA cycle that are withdrawn for growth, using two molecules of acetyl-

88

CoA as substrate (Kornberg, 1966). The glyoxylate cycle is essential for cells growing on acetate

89

or other non-glycolytic carbon sources, such as fatty acids, that are directly catabolized into

90

acetyl-CoA. However, when glucose or amino acids are available, the glyoxylate cycle is not

91

essential since the compounds required for growth can be supplied by alternative ways. In these

92

cases, blocking the glyoxylate cycle can be hypothesized to enhance lipid production by

93

increasing the flow of the available acetyl-CoA to fatty acid synthesis pathway and energy

94

generation without affecting cell growth (Figure 1A).

95

For ADP1, protein-rich substrates provide an excellent carbon and nutrient source for growth,

96

i.e. biomass production. However, due to the high nitrogen content, they are not suitable for the

97

production of WEs. Here, we employ a metabolic engineering strategy aiming at efficient lipid

98

accumulation, even from nitrogen-rich carbon sources, thus bypassing the need for high

99

carbon/nitrogen ratio. We engineered A. baylyi ADP1 by deleting the gene aceA from the

100

genome and overexpressing the gene acr1 which encodes for the fatty acyl-CoA reductase

101

(Figure 1B). The gene aceA encodes for isocitrate lyase, catalyzing the first step of the

102

glyoxylate cycle, in which isocitrate is cleaved into succinate and glyoxylate. Glyoxylate is

103

subsequently combined with one molecule of acetyl-CoA to form malate. The downstream

104

pathway was up-regulated by acr1 overexpression for directing the generated acetyl-CoA to

105

WEs. We first evaluated the production of WEs by the engineered strain using glucose as carbon

106

source. Prior to the evaluation of WE production from nitrogen-rich substrates, we examined the

107

utilization of 20 amino acids as sole carbon source and explored the effect of aceA deletion on

108

cell growth and lipid synthesis. We finally cultivated the engineered strain with different

109

nitrogen-rich substrates (casamino acids, yeast extract and baker’s yeast hydrolysate) for WE

110

production. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improved the production of WEs

111

from both glucose and nitrogen-rich substrates.

Modified LB medium (10 g/l tryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract, 1 g/l NaCl) supplemented with 1%

127

glucose was used to grow E. coli and A. baylyi ADP1 for strain constructions. The cultivations

128

for characterization of amino acid utilization and WE production were carried out using modified

132

characterization of amino acid utilization, 20 L-amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine,

described by Huo et al. (Huo et al., 2011), with some modifications. Briefly, 126 g/L biomass

142

was mixed with water and heated at 80-85 °C for 18 min, after which the biomass was digested

143

with 1-2 g/L protease (from Bacillus sp., Sigma) and incubated at 60 °C overnight. The digestion

144

product was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and further filtered for use as

145

substrate. Corresponding antibiotics were added in the media when necessary (with a

146

concentration of 50 mg/L for spectinomycin, 50 mg/L for kanamycin, and 25 mg/L for

147

chloramphenicol).

148

2.2. Genetic manipulation

149

The molecular cloning was performed using established methods. The reagents for the molecular

150

work, including PCR, digestion and ligation, were provided by Thermo Scientific (USA) and

151

used according to provider’s instruction. Transformation and genome editing of A. baylyi ADP1

152

were carried out as described previously (Santala et al., 2011b). All the primers used in the study

153

are listed in Table S3.

154

The strains ADP1 ΔaceA (ΔACIAD1084) and ADP1 Δacr1 (ΔACIAD3383) were a kind gift

155

from Dr Veronique de Berardinis (Genoscope, France). The strain ADP1 iluxAB was previously

156

constructed in our laboratory (Santala et al., 2011a); in the strain the gene poxB (ACIAD3381) is

157

replaced with the genes luxAB under T5 promoter. Deletion of the gene poxB has been shown to

158

be neutral in terms of growth and WE production (Santala et al., 2011b).

159

The construction of the strain W1 was carried out as follows. First, the gene acr1 was amplified

160

from the genome of A. baylyi ADP1 using the primers tl17 and sa16. The amplified gene acr1

161

was cloned to a previously described chromosomal integration cassette (Santala et al., 2011a)

162

under a strong constitutive promoter T5. The original chloramphenicol resistance marker in the

163

cassette was replaced with spectinomycin resistance marker originated from the plasmid

164

pIM1463 (Murin et al., 2012), amplified with the primers tl45 and tl46. The resulting cassette

165

was further amplified using the primers JL18-3 and JL18-4. The plasmid pUC57 containing the

166

flanking sequences of the gene aceA was purchased from GenScript (USA) and further linearized

167

using the primers JL18-1 and JL18-2. The linearized plasmid was ligated with the previously

168

amplified cassette using Gibson Assembly, resulting in the targeting vector. The targeting vector

169

was used transform the strain ADP1 Δacr1 to replace the gene aceA with the gene acr1 under T5

170

promoter by homologous recombination, resulting the strain W1 (Δacr1::kanr, ΔaceA::PT 5 -

171

acr1,specr). For the construction of the strain ADP1 ΔaceA, iluxAB, a previously constructed

172

cassette (Santala et al., 2011a), which contains the genes luxA and luxB under T5 promoter,

173

chloramphenicol resistance marker and the flanking sequences of the gene poxB, was used

174

transform the strain ADP1 ΔaceA. The desired strains were selected with corresponding

175

antibiotics.

176

2.3. Flux balance analysis

177

Flux balance analysis (FBA) (Orth et al., 2010) was used to predict the essentiality of gene

178

deletion and calculate the theoretical yields of the conversion of the 6 L-amino acids (alanine,

179

asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine and proline) and glucose into WEs by ADP1.

180

A previously described genome-wide A. baylyi metabolic network (Durot et al., 2008) was used

181

for the implementation of FBA. To allow simulation of WE accumulation, an exchange reaction

182

of WEs was added in the metabolic network. In all conducted FBAs for essentiality prediction

183

and WE yield calculation, the model was given 1 g/h/g CDW of each carbon source as an input

184

(with the default minimal medium components and unlimited oxygen), and the growth reaction

185

and the WE exchange reaction were maximized for respectively.

2.4. Characterization of amino acid utilization

187

The strains ADP1 ΔaceA, iluxAB and ADP1 iluxAB were used for the characterization of amino

188

acid utilization. Both strains were cultivated in duplicate on 96-well plate (200 μl medium/well)

189

with different single amino acids as carbon source respectively. The plate was incubated in Spark

190

multimode microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland) at 30 °C. Double orbital shaking was

191

performed for 5 min twice an hour with an amplitude of 6 mm and a frequency of 54 rpm.

192

Optical density at 600 nm (OD600 ) and luminescence signal were measured every 30 min.

193

2.5. Cultivation for wax ester production

194

For all the cultivations, the cells were first taken from agar plates containing LB medium and 1%

195

glucose with corresponding antibiotics (if necessary, antibiotics were not added in subsequent

196

cultivations). Cultivations were conducted in 50 ml medium/250 ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks at 25 °C

197

and 300 rpm. Cultivations were carried out in duplicate with a starting OD600 of 0.1, using both

198

glucose medium and nitrogen-rich media (media containing casamino acids, yeast extract and

199

baker’s yeast hydrolysate respectively) as described in “Strains and media” section. For the

200

cultivation with glucose, cells were cultivated for 24 h and 48 h before harvesting. Considering

201

that WEs might be degraded after the carbon source is depleted, cells were harvested before

202

reaching stationary phase in nitrogen-rich media which contain 10 g/L, 20 g/L casamino acids

203

and 50% baker’s yeast hydrolysate. When cultivated with yeast extract, cells were harvested at 5

204

h (before reaching stationary phase) and 24 h.

205

2.6. Analytical methods

was added for the hydrolysis of proteins into amino acids. The concentration of amine groups

208

before and after protease digestion was determined by Ninhydrin Assay. To determine the

209

protein content of the yeast sample, the biomass was heated in 0.5 N NaOH at 80-85 °C for 30

210

min, allowing release of protein. Bradford Assay was performed for protein concentration

211

measurement.

212

WEs were analyzed by the thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis after small-scale lipid

213

extraction, as described earlier (Lehtinen et al., 2018a). Briefly, cells were collected from proper

214

amount of culture by centrifugation. WEs were extracted from the cells with methanol-

215

chloroform extraction method. The lower phase was used for TLC analysis, using glass HPTLC

216

Silica Gel 60 F254 plate (Merck, USA). The mobile phase was a mixture of hexane, diethyl ether

217

and acetic acid with a ratio of 90:15:1. Jojoba oil was used as the standard of WEs. Visualization

218

was carried out with iodine.

219

Consumption of glucose was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The

220

analysis was performed with LC-20AC prominence liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu, USA)

221

equipped with RID-10A refractive Index detector. Phenomenex Rezex RHM-monosaccharide

222

H+ (8%) column (Phenomenex, USA) was used and 0.01 N sulfuric acid was used as mobile

223

phase with a pumping rate of 0.6 ml/min.

224

Quantification of WEs was carried out using 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The cells

225

were harvested from 40 ml culture by centrifugation at 30000 g for 30 min. The harvested cells

226

were freeze-dried with Christ APLHA1-4 LD plus freeze dryer (Germany) for 24 h. The

227

extraction of lipid from the freeze-dried cells and analysis with NMR were performed as

228

described previously (Santala et al., 2011a). The chemical shift of 4.05 ppm corresponds to the

229

proton signal of α-alkoxy-methylene group of WEs. The integral value of the signal at 4.05 ppm

3.1. Metabolic engineering for redirecting carbon flow from growth to lipid synthesis

234

Commercialization of microbial lipid production requires development of efficient cell catalyst.

235

Previous metabolic engineering strategies have successfully demonstrated optimizing the

236

production organisms, such as by blocking the competing pathways (Lu et al., 2008), increasing

237

the supply of precursors (Lu et al., 2008; Tai and Stephanopoulos, 2013), deregulation of fatty

238

acid synthesis pathway (Lu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2012) or balancing the reducing power

239

(Qiao et al., 2017). However, challenges related to the competition between growth and lipid

240

synthesis still remain. In addition, the tendency to accumulate lipids in oleaginous species, such

241

as oleaginous yeast, depends on nitrogen limitation due to strict regulation (Garay et al., 2014).

242

Typically, nitrogen limitation coupled with excess of carbon is used for lipid accumulation. In

243

the strategy, biomass is accumulated in the first stage and lipid accumulation occurs upon

244

nitrogen exhaustion. On one hand, the two-stage process can lower the productivity, and nitrogen

245

limitation may not be suitable for cells (over)expressing non-native activities. On the other hand,

246

lipid production from nitrogen-rich substrates, which represent abundant by-products in current

247

industrial scenarios (Li et al., 2018), can be difficult.

248

WEs have been previously produced by A. baylyi ADP1 from various carbon sources, including

249

alkanes (Ishige et al., 2002), glucose (Kannisto et al., 2017; Lehtinen et al., 2018a), acetate and

250

butyrate (Salmela et al., 2018). However, WE production from nitrogen-rich substrates has not

251

been described, possibly due to the requirement of nitrogen limitation to induce lipid

252

accumulation. We have previously observed WE production during exponential phase in A.

253

baylyi ADP1 (Santala et al., 2018, 2011a), indicating that nutrient limitation is not a strict

254

requirement for lipid accumulation. We hypothesized that proper redirection of carbon flow from

255

growth to lipid synthesis could enable enhanced WE accumulation and improved WE production

256

from both the optimal substrate, namely glucose, and also from non-optimal substrates such as

257

nitrogen-rich substrates. To validate the hypothesis, we constructed a strain W1 in which the

258

gene aceA was replaced with the gene acr1 under strong constitutive promoter. The native acr1

259

was deleted in the strain. Deletion of aceA blocks the glyoxylate cycle, increasing the availability

260

of acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis pathway and energy generation. The gene acr1 encodes for

261

a NADPH-dependent fatty acyl-CoA reductase, which reduces fatty acyl-CoA to fatty aldehyde.

262

It was previously shown that overexpression of acr1 improved WE production with a titer of

263

0.45 g/L (yield of 0.04 g/g glucose) (Lehtinen et al., 2018a) . In the previous study, acr1 was

264

located under lac-inducible promoter and highest WE production was obtained with the highest

265

IPTG-concentration studied. Thus here we decided to use the strong T5-promoter. With this

266

engineered strain, we studied WE production from both glucose and nitrogen-rich substrates,

267

namely casamino acids, yeast extract and baker’s yeast hydrolysate.

268

The essentiality of aceA deletion to the cells when growing on acetate, glucose and 20 common

269

L-amino acids was predicted using FBA by maximizing for the growth reaction before and after

270

aceA deletion. In the simulations, 7 amino acids could be used as sole carbon source by A. baylyi

271

ADP1, including alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine and proline

272

(subsequent experimental validation showed that arginine cannot be used as sole carbon source).

273

As expected, the gene aceA was predicted to be essential when acetate was used as sole carbon

274

source; the theoretical specific growth rate did not change after aceA deletion when glucose or

15

275

amino acids were used as carbon source (Table S1). We further inspected the change of the

276

theoretical maximum yield of WEs from glucose and amino acids when increasing the carbon

277

flux through isocitrate cleavage reaction. The inputs of different carbon sources (glucose and

278

different amino acids) were set to 1 g/h/g CDW, and WE accumulation was maximized for. The

279

maximum yield achievable by the model was decreased with the increase of flux through

280

isocitrate cleavage reaction (Table S2). As the yields obtained with basic FBA consider only

281

(genome-scale) stoichiometry but not kinetics or exact thermodynamics, the effect magnitude of

282

aceA deletion on WE production is not accurately reflected in the simulation.

283

3.2. WE production from glucose

284

We first carried out batch-cultivation in flask with 200 mM glucose as carbon source to evaluate

285

the production of WEs by the three strains, ADP1 WT (wild type ADP1 as control), ADP1

286

ΔaceA (with aceA deletion) and W1 (with aceA deletion and acr1 overexpression). The three

287

strains were cultivated for 24 h and 48 h. As shown in Figure 2, significantly improved WE

288

production was observed in W1. After 24 h, both ADP1 ΔaceA and W1 had higher WE content

289

and yield than ADP1 WT, and ADP1 ΔaceA had similar WE content as W1 (Figure 2B and 2C).

290

However, ADP1 ΔaceA grew poorly, resulting in low CDW (Figure 2D) and low WE titer

291

(Figure 2A). The strain seemed to stop growing before 24 h and did not further consume glucose

292

(Figure S1). The reason for this is unknown. It is worth noting, however, that after 24 h, the pH

293

of the culture dropped significantly below 4 for ADP1 ΔaceA while the pH was above 6.5 for

294

W1 and ADP1 WT (data not shown), which indicated impaired metabolism in ADP1 ΔaceA. W1

295

had lower CDW than ADP1 WT (Figure 2D) but with 1.6-fold higher WE titer after 24 h (Figure

296

2A). After 48 h, W1 produced the highest WE titer of 1.82 g/L (3.15-fold higher than ADP1

297

WT) and the highest yield of 0.075 g/g glucose reported to date (3-fold higher than ADP1 WT)

298

(Figure 2A and 2B), accumulating up to 0.27 g/g CDW of WEs (3-fold higher than ADP1 WT)

299

(Figure 2C). The difference of CDW between the two strains was not significant (Figure 2D).

300

These results suggest that, when glucose was used as carbon source, aceA deletion in

301

combination with acr1 overexpression significantly enhanced WE accumulation without

302

considerably reducing cell growth, resulting in improved titer, productivity and yield. Although

303

the strain ADP1 ΔaceA grew poorly, it still had higher WE content and yield than ADP1 WT.

304

However, it is not clear why ADP1 ΔaceA had poor growth and whether overexpression of acr1

305

in W1 played a role in the rescue of growth. It can be speculated that the balance between energy

306

production and biomass formation was impaired in the strain ADP1 ΔaceA. It was reported that,

307

in E. coli, addition of glucose results in shut-off of the glyoxylate cycle due to the

308

dephosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase which competes with isocitrate lyase for the

309

common substrate isocitrate (Walsh and Koshland, 1985). In this study, the altered phenotype of

310

the aceA deletion strains when cultivated with glucose might indicate that in A. baylyi ADP1 the

311

glyoxylate cycle is still active in the presence of glucose. If this is the case, the improved WE

312

accumulation could be due to the increased availability of acetyl-CoA resulted from the blockage

313

of the glyoxyate cycle as hypothesized. In addition, it is possible that some acetyl-CoA was

314

redirected to the oxidative step in the TCA cycle, which might also benefit WE production by

315

providing the reducing agent NADPH required for fatty acyl-ACP synthesis and fatty acyl-CoA

316

reduction; Acinetobacter sp. has two isoenzymes of NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase

317

catalyzing the oxidation of isocitrate in the TCA cycle (Self and Weitzman, 1972).

318

The TCA cycle plays an important role in amino acid synthesis (Roberts et al., 1953). In A.

319

baylyi ADP1, some TCA cycle intermediates, such as oxaloacetate and 2-ketoglutarate, are

320

required for the synthesis of amino acids, such as aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine and

321

proline. When glucose is used as carbon source, the intermediates of the TCA cycle are

322

continuously withdrawn for amino acid synthesis and have to be replenished again. If the

323

glyoxylate cycle is still active in the presence of glucose as suggested before, deletion of aceA

324

will block the replenishment by the glyoxylate cycle from acetyl-CoA. As A. baylyi ADP1 lacks

325

pyruvate carboxylase, the replenishment can be only accomplished by phosphoenolpyruvate

326

carboxylation, in which phosphoenolpyruvate reacts with carbon dioxide to form oxaloacetate.

332

3.3. Exploration of amino acid utilization by the aceA knockout strain

333

Previous results indicate that aceA deletion increases the content and yield of WEs when glucose

334

is used as carbon source. The same strategy is expected to benefit WE accumulation when cells

335

are cultivated with nitrogen-rich substrates. Prior to using nitrogen-rich substrates for WE

336

production, we first characterized the utilization of 20 single L-amino acids by the aceA

337

knockout ADP1 and employed a bacterial luciferase-based biosensor to monitor the intracellular

338

production of long-chain fatty aldehyde in real-time during the cultivation (Santala et al., 2011a).

339

Bacterial luciferase (LuxAB) catalyzes the oxidation of FMNH2 (reduced flavin mononucleotide)

340

and long-chain fatty aldehyde, resulting in emission of light (Szittner and Meighen, 1990). We

341

integrated the gene luxA and luxB into the genome of the strain ADP1 ΔaceA, resulting in the

342

strain ADP1 ΔaceA, iluxAB. A previously constructed strain ADP1 iluxAB was used as control

343

(Santala et al., 2011a). Both strains were cultivated with 20 amino acids as sole carbon source

344

respectively. Since long-chain fatty aldehyde is the precursor for WE synthesis, its production

345

can reflect the carbon flux towards WE synthesis as well as fatty acid synthesis pathway.

346

The results showed that 6 amino acids could be used as sole carbon source by ADP1, including

347

alanine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine and proline (Figure 3A). Arginine could not

348

be used as sole carbon source by ADP1 although it was predicted to be used by the FBA (Table

349

S1) due to the existence of the arginine succinyltransferase (AST) pathway in the ADP1 model.

350

In E. coli, the pathway allows arginine to be used as nitrogen source but not carbon source,

351

putatively due to inappropriately controlled promoter or inadequate transport during carbon-

352

limited growth (Schneider et al., 1998). It was previously hypothesized that the inability of

353

ADP1 to use arginine as sole carbon source is due to the same reason (Durot et al., 2008). The 6

354

amino acids undergo different catabolic pathways. According to the metabolic model (Durot et
19

355

al., 2008) used for FBA, L-alanine is first converted to D-alanine by alanine racemase, after

356

which the D-alanine is converted to pyruvate by D-alanine dehydrogenase. Pyruvate can be

357

converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or phosphoenolpyruvate by

358

phosphoenolpyruvate synthase. In the aceA knockout strain, the acetyl-CoA cannot be converted

359

to the TCA cycle intermediates through the glyoxylate cycle, and the replenishment is

360

accomplished via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylation, which is similar to the case with glucose.

361

The catabolism of the other 5 amino acids leads to the formation of the TCA cycle intermediates;

362

asparagine/aspartate is converted to fumarate or oxaloacetate while proline/glutamine/glutamate

363

is converted to α-ketoglutarate. The TCA cycle intermediates malate oxaloacetate are converted

364

to pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate by decarboxylation for gluconeogenesis and formation of

365

acetyl-CoA.

366

As shown in Figure 3A, ADP1 ΔaceA, iluxAB grew more slowly and reached lower final OD600

367

than ADP1 iluxAB when cultivated with the 6 amino acids as sole carbon source. While the

368

slower growth with alanine could be explained by lower availability of acetyl-CoA for the TCA

369

cycle replenishment, it is surprising that the cultivations with the other 5 amino acids also led to

370

slower growth since their catabolism forms the TCA cycle intermediates and does not directly

371

lead to the formation of acetyl-CoA. Interestingly, the deletion of aceA seemed to have a

372

negative effect on glutamate metabolism as the growth of ADP1 ΔaceA, iluxAB on glutamate

373

was restrained to a much larger degree than on other amino acids (Figure 3A). In addition,

374

diauxic growth was observed in ADP1 ΔaceA, iluxAB: the strain grew slowly in the beginning

375

and stopped growing for a long period of time before growing again. The observation indicates

376

that the deletion of aceA may have an influence on the regulation of glutamate metabolism.

377

The luminescence signals generated by the two strains were monitored during the cultivation; the

378

cumulative luminescence can be used as an indicator to compare the amounts of fatty aldehyde

379

produced by the two strains (Lehtinen et al., 2018a; Salmela et al., 2019; Santala et al., 2011a).

380

In comparison with ADP1 iluxAB, ADP1 ΔaceA, iluxAB generated higher cumulative

381

luminescence in the end of the cultivations with not only alanine but also asparagine, aspartate,

382

glutamine and proline (Figure 3B), suggesting more fatty aldehyde produced by ADP1 ΔaceA,

383

iluxAB. This was also the case for the cultivation with glutamate, even though ADP1 ΔaceA,

384

iluxAB grew poorly on glutamate. The change of luminescence/OD600 over time could enable us

385

to elucidate the luminescence production profiles of the two strains (Figure S2). ADP1 iluxAB

386

had similar luminescence production profiles on the six amino acids: the luminescence/OD600

387

peaked when cells were in early exponential phase, followed by drastic drop of the signal (Figure

388

S2). It can be speculated that the cells were the most active in early exponential phase with

389

available carbon flux towards fatty aldehyde, but the competition with growth for the carbon flux

390

resulted in decrease of fatty aldehyde production. In comparison, the change of

391

luminescence/OD600 was more subtle for ADP1 ΔaceA, iluxAB during cell growth (Figure S2),

392

which might indicate more balanced distribution of carbon flux between growth and fatty

393

aldehyde production. These results suggest that deletion of aceA could allow higher fatty

394

aldehyde production at the cost of slower growth when single amino acids were used as sole

395

carbon source.

405

3.4. WE production from casein amino acids and yeast extract

406

We next studied WE accumulation from casamino acids (casein hydrolysate) by the strain W1

407

and ADP1 WT. The strains W1 and ADP1 WT were cultivated in two conditions, with 10 g/L

408

and 20 g/L casamino acids as carbon source. In order to compare WE accumulation between the

409

two strains, the cells were harvested when OD600 was about 2 at which the cells were still in

410

exponential phase, considering that WEs might be rapidly degraded under carbon limiting

411

conditions (Santala et al., 2011a). As shown in Figure 4A, the concentration of casamino acids

412

did not have a significant influence on the growth of both strains. ADP1 WT grew faster and

413

reached OD600 of 2 after 4 h while W1 had a slower growth and reached OD600 of 2 after 11 h. As

414

glutamic acid typically accounts for a large proportion in the amino acid profile of casein, it is

415

possible that the negative effect on glutamate metabolism by aceA deletion may play a role in the

416

slower growth of W1. Despite being in nitrogen-rich conditions, WT ADP1 still accumulated a

417

small amount of WEs during exponential phase, with a content of 0.02 g/g CDW in both 10 and

418

20 g/L casamino acids (Figure 4B). In comparison, W1 accumulated approximately 0.13 and

419

0.11 g/g CDW of WEs in the cultivations with 10 g/L and 20 g/L casamino acids, respectively

420

(Figure 4B), suggesting 5-6 folds enhanced accumulation of WEs during exponential phase. The

422

To study the WE accumulation using yeast extract, a cultivation with 20 g/L yeast extract as

423

substrate was performed. The cells were harvested during exponential phase (5 h) and after

424

reaching stationary phase (24 h). Interestingly, W1 and ADP1 WT showed similar growth, and

425

the difference of CDW between the two strains was not apparent when harvested after 5 h of

426

cultivation (Figure 4C). Although W1 had 1.9-fold higher WE content than ADP1 WT (Figure

427

4D), the content (0.036 g/g CDW) was much lower than those obtained with casamino acids. The

428

difference of cell growth phase may affect the content of WEs, but the main reason of the lower

429

WE content might be attributed to the composition difference between casamino acids and yeast

430

extract. Apart from free amino acids and peptides, yeast extract also contains other nutrients,

431

such as vitamins, macro and micro minerals, which may benefit growth more than lipid

432

accumulation. After 24 h, WEs were not detected from both strains due to degradation (Figure

433

4D). Under the nitrogen-rich condition, carbon source was likely to be the growth-limiting factor

434

during the stationary phase, and the accumulated WEs could be consumed as energy and carbon

435

source. Further engineering, such as blocking β-oxidation by deletion of related genes (Lu et al.,

436

2008; Steen et al., 2010), could be a potential strategy to prevent WE degradation.

437

Here, we demonstrated a novel metabolic engineering strategy that resulted in significantly

438

improved WE production in nitrogen-rich conditions. However, further engineering is still

439

needed to obtain high WE titer from protein-rich substrates. The A. baylyi strain employed in the

440

study can only utilize 6 amino acids as sole carbon source. For the application point of view, it is

441

important to develop a strain that can utilize more amino acids as carbon source. Chemical

442

mutagenesis has been shown to be an effective way to improve amino acid utilization (Huo et al.,

443

2011), and the obtained E. coli mutant was able to utilize 13 individual amino acids as sole

444

carbon source, compared to 4 for the wild type strain. Moreover, microbes have evolved

445

mechanisms that favor amino acid anabolism (Wernick and Liao, 2013). A driving force for

446

deamination would allow more carbon skeletons to be released from amino acids for product

447

formation, and the strategies for creating the driving force have been well demonstrated in E. coli

448

by Huo et al. (Huo et al., 2011). It was shown that deamination could be facilitated by deletion of

449

genes related to ammonium-assimilation pathway (Huo et al., 2011; Mikami et al., 2017).

450

Furthermore, introduction of exogenous transamination-deamination cycles further drained

451

amino acids that serve as nitrogen reservoir as the result of transamination

3.5. WE production from baker’s yeast hydrolysate

461

Renewable plant-derived biomass and algal biomass have been emerging as alternatives to fossil

462

fuels for the production of fuels and chemicals (Peralta-Yahya et al., 2012; Pfleger et al., 2015;

463

Ragauskas, 2006; Steen et al., 2010). However, this scenario is accompanied with accumulation

464

of large amount of nitrogen-rich by-products (Li et al., 2018). It was estimated that 100 Mt/year

465

of protein could be generated if 10% of transportation fuels were produced from biomass-derived

466

sources (Tuck et al., 2012). In addition, considerable amount of protein-rich wastes are produced

467

from brewery and food industries (Ferreira et al., 2010; Tuck et al., 2012). It is of great

468

importance to exploit the value of these waste streams on the ground of circular economy. One

469

option is to use them as animal feeds , but the limited market is not able to deal with the

470

increasing amount of protein wastes (Huo et al., 2011). Thus, strategies have been brought out

471

for the valorization of protein wastes, of which microbial production of valuable products

472

directly from protein wastes is advantageous, as compared to other processes that require costly

473

amino acid isolation steps (Li et al., 2018). Although production of a range of chemicals from

474

protein sources has been proposed (Huo et al., 2011), it is challenging to efficiently produce

475

oleochemicals, such as storage lipids, from nitrogen-rich protein wastes.

476

To evaluate of possibility of using industrial spent yeast for WE production, dry baker’s yeast

477

was used as a representative feedstock. To obtain baker’s yeast hydrolysate that can be used as

478

substrate, a heat treatment was performed for the biomass, followed by digestion with protease to

479

break the peptide bonds of released proteins. The medium was supplemented with 50% baker’s

480

yeast hydrolysate for cultivation. Cells were harvested during exponential phase (after 4.7 h) and

481

early stationary phase (after 8 h) where the WE content is likely to be the highest. The CDWs of

482

the strains W1 and ADP1 WT did not differ significantly after 4.7 and 8 h of cultivation (Figure

483

5C). W1 accumulated WEs from 0.025 g/g CDW in exponential phase to 0.030 g/g CDW in

484

early stationary phase, while the WE content of ADP1 WT did not significantly increase in the

485

end of the cultivation and was maintained at around 0.016 g/g CDW (Figure 5B). The difference

486

of WE content between the two strains can be also seen through WE visualization (Figure 5D).

487

The final WE titer of 0.066 g/L was obtained with WI, which was 2-fold higher than that

488

obtained with ADP1 WT (Figure 5A). The results suggest that the protein-rich biomass can be a

489

good feedstock for microbial production; the fermentable hydrolysate could be obtained by

490

simple pretreatment process.

4. Conclusions

498

In this study, we engineered A. baylyi ADP1 to improve the production of WEs by deletion of

499

aceA and overexpression of acr1. As a result of redirecting the carbon flux, the engineered strain

500

produced 27% WEs of CDW with a titer of 1.8 g/l from glucose, representing approximately 3-

501

fold improvement in production metrics (titer, yield, productivity) compared to WT. We further

demonstrated the possibility to use nitrogen-rich substrates for WE production by A. baylyi

503

ADP1. The engineering led to 5-6 fold improvement in WE accumulation from casamino acids;

504

the amount of WEs produced by the engineered strain was similar to that produced by ADP1 WT

505

from glucose. The study represents the starting point for establishing efficient high-value lipid

506

production from non-optimal substrates such as protein-rich waste streams. We also anticipate

507

that this approach could provide insight for improving the production of other oleochemicals.
