ABSTRACT
Disruption of cyclophilin A (CypA)-capsid interactions affects HIV-1

31

replication in human lymphocytes. To understand the mechanism, we used

32

Jurkat cells, human PBMCs, and human CD4+ T cells. Our results showed that

33

the inhibition of HIV-1 infection caused by disrupting CypA-capsid interactions is

34

dependent on human TRIM5α (TRIM5αhu), suggesting that TRIM5αhu restricts

35

HIV-1. Accordingly, we found that TRIM5αhu binds to the HIV-1 core. Disruption

36

of CypA-capsid interactions failed to affect HIV-1-A92E infection, correlating with

37

the loss of TRIM5αhu binding to HIV-1-A92E cores. Disruption of CypA-capsid

38

interactions in PBMCs and CD4+ T cells had a greater inhibitory effect on HIV-1

39

when compared to Jurkat cells. HIV-1-A92E infection of PBMCs and CD4+ T cells

40

was unaffected by disruption of CypA-capsid interactions. Consistent with

41

TRIM5α restriction, disruption of CypA-capsid interactions in CD4+ T cells

42

inhibited reverse transcription. Overall, our results showed that CypA binding to

43

the core protects HIV-1 from TRIM5αhu restriction.

INTRODUCTION
The early steps of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) replication

54

involve delivery of the viral core into the host cytoplasm. The viral core is a

55

conical structure composed of ~1,500 monomers of the HIV-1 capsid protein,

56

which protects the viral RNA genome (Pornillos et al., 2009; Sundquist and Hill,

57

2007). The capsid protein plays a role in uncoating, reverse transcription, and

58

nuclear import. To perform these functions, the capsid protein has been shown to

59

functionally interact with several host dependency factors, including cyclophilin A

60

(CypA) (Luban et al., 1993), Nup153 (Buffone et al., 2018; Di Nunzio et al., 2013)

61

(Brass et al., 2008; Konig et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2010; Matreyek and Engelman,

62

2011; Matreyek et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2008), RANBP2 (Di Nunzio et al., 2012;

63

Meehan et al., 2014; Ocwieja et al., 2011), and TNPO3 (Brass et al., 2008; Christ

64

et al., 2008; Konig et al., 2008; Krishnan et al., 2010; Levin et al., 2010; Ocwieja

65

et al., 2011; Thys et al., 2011; Valle-Casuso et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2008).

66

Effective HIV-1 infection may occur only when these factors interact with the HIV-

67

1 core at the appropriate time and in the appropriate order, thus raising the

68

possibility that the initial binding of particular factors may modulate the

69

subsequent binding of other factors.

70
71

The interaction of CypA with monomeric HIV-1 capsid was originally

72

reported about 30 years ago (Luban et al., 1993), and it has been well-

73

established that this interaction modulates HIV-1 infection (Braaten et al., 1996;

74

Braaten and Luban, 2001; Li et al., 2009; Schaller et al., 2011; Sherry et al.,

75

1998; Sokolskaja et al., 2004; Thali et al., 1994; Towers et al., 2003). Although

76

the ability of CypA to modulate HIV-1 infection is cell-type dependent, it is clear

77

that the disruption of CypA-capsid interactions negatively affects HIV-1 infection

78

of lymphocytes (Braaten and Luban, 2001; Li et al., 2009; Ptak et al., 2008;

79

Sherry et al., 1998; Sokolskaja et al., 2004; Towers et al., 2003; Wainberg et al.,

80

1988; Yin et al., 1998); however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive.

81

To investigate the molecular events that result in a decrease in HIV-1

82

infection upon disruption of CypA-capsid interactions in lymphocytes, we used

83

Jurkat cells, primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and

84

primary human CD4+ T cells as experimental models. Our experiments revealed

85

that inhibition of HIV-1 infection caused by disrupting CypA-capsid interactions is

86

dependent on the expression TRIM5αhu. These results suggested that TRIM5αhu

87

is restricting HIV-1 infection upon disruption of CypA-capsid interactions. In

88

agreement, we found that TRIM5αhu binds to the HIV-1 core. Interestingly,

89

TRIM5αhu does not bind to HIV-1 cores bearing the capsid mutant A92E (HIV-1-

90

A92E). Infection of HIV-1-A92E viruses was not affected by disruption of CypA-

91

capsid interactions, which correlates with the loss of TRIM5αhu binding to HIV-1

92

cores bearing the A92E mutation. These experiments suggested that CypA

93

protects the HIV-1 core from TRIM5αhu. Although the infectivity defect observed

94

in Jurkat cells is small, disruption of CypA-interactions in PBMCs and CD4+ T

95

cells causes a major defect in infectivity. In agreement with our hypothesis that

96

CypA is protecting the core from TRIM5αhu, infection of PBMCs and CD4+ T cells

97

by HIV-1-A92E viruses was insensitive to the disruption of CypA-capsid

interactions. Consistently with a block imposed by TRIM5α proteins, disruption of

99

CypA-capsid interactions in CD4+ T cells dramatically decreased the efficiency of

100

reverse transcription. Overall, our investigations suggested a model in which

101

CypA binding to the HIV-1 core protects the core from the restriction factor

RESULTS

122

HIV-1 infection of Jurkat cells is sensitive to Cyclosporin A treatment.

123

To understand the role of CypA in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells, we

124

used the human T-cell line Jurkat as an experimental model. Cyclosporin A

125

(CsA) is a molecule that binds to CypA, and thus blocks cellular CypA activity. To

126

measure the effect of CsA treatment on HIV-1 infectivity, we infected Jurkat cells

127

with HIV-1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (HIV-1-GFP) in the presence of

128

10 µM CsA. Consistent with results from previous studies (Braaten and Luban,

129

2001; Hatziioannou et al., 2005; Li et al., 2009; Ptak et al., 2008; Sokolskaja et

130

al., 2004; Towers et al., 2003; Wainberg et al., 1988; Yin et al., 1998), HIV-1-

131

GFP infection of human Jurkat T cells was sensitive to CsA treatment (Figure 1A,

132

upper panel). Experiments were repeated multiple times and the fraction of GFP-

133

positive cells normalized to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated control is

134

shown (Figure 1A, lower panel). To further confirm the importance of CypA-

135

capsid interactions in HIV-1 infection, we challenged Jurkat T cells with p24-

136

normalized amounts of HIV-1-P90A and HIV-1-G89V, which are mutant versions

137

of HIV-1 that disrupt CypA-capsid interactions (Gamble et al., 1996; Thali et al.,

138

1994). Infection was determined by measuring the percentage of GFP-positive

139

cells at 48 h post-infection. We found that the mutant HIV-1 strains bearing

140

capsid changes that disrupted CypA-capsid interactions were less infectious than

141

wild-type HIV-1 (Figure 1B, upper panel). Experiments were repeated multiple

142

times and the fraction of GFP-positive cells normalized to control is shown

143

(Figure 1B, lower panel). Although Jurkat cells failed to show a dramatic

144

decrease in HIV-1 infectivity as a result of disrupted CypA-capsid interactions, we

145

still used this cell line as a model to mechanistically understand the contribution

146

of CypA to HIV-1 infection.

147
148
149

Human TRIM5α (TRIM5α hu) binds to the HIV-1 capsid.
Previous studies have shown that CypA modulates the ability of rhesus

150

tripartite motif (TRIM) protein, TRIM5α (TRIM5αrh), to restrict HIV-1 infection

151

(Berthoux et al., 2005; Burse et al., 2017; Keckesova et al., 2006; Lin and

152

Emerman, 2008; Stremlau et al., 2006b), which is not surprising because both

153

proteins interact with the HIV-1 core. It is well known that TRIM5αrh cages the

154

HIV-1 core using cooperative binding during infection (Diaz-Griffero et al., 2009;

155

Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011; Stremlau et al., 2006a). Because both CypA and

156

TRIM5αrh bind to the HIV-1 core, it is possible that CypA modulates the binding

157

of TRIM5αrh to the HIV-1 core and vice versa.

158

More recent studies have suggested that TRIM5αhu blocks HIV-1 infection

159

(Jimenez-Guardeno et al., 2019; OhAinle et al., 2018), possibly by binding to the

160

HIV-1 core. Therefore, we tested the ability of TRIM5αhu to bind to the HIV-1 core

161

using our capsid binding assay (Selyutina et al., 2018). We found that TRIM5αhu

162

binds to the HIV-1 core (Figure 2). TRIM5αhu showed a stronger interaction with

163

the HIV-1 core compared with TRIM5αrh (Figure 2). Our results showed for the

164

first time that TRIM5αhu interacted with the HIV-1 core. One possibility is that

165

CypA modulates the ability of TRIM5αhu to interact with the HIV-1 core.

166

TRIM5αhu expression is necessary for the inhibition of HIV-1 infection

167

mediated by the disruption of CypA-capsid interactions.

168

Because of the ability of TRIM5αhu to bind to the HIV-1 core, we tested

169

whether TRIM5αhu is involved in the blocking of HIV-1 infection mediated by the

170

disruption of CypA-capsid interactions. For this purpose, we achieved knockdown

171

(KD) of TRIM5αhu expression in Jurkat cells using a specific short hairpin RNA

172

(shRNA) against TRIM5αhu (Figure 3), as described in Materials and Methods. To

173

test for TRIM5αhu expression, we challenged different sets of TRIM5αhu KD cells

174

with increasing amounts of N-tropic murine leukemia virus GFP (N-MLV-GFP),

175

which is restricted by TRIM5αhu. We found that Jurkat TRIM5αhu KD cells were

176

susceptible to N-MLV infection (Figure 3A), whereas in shRNA control cells, N-

177

MLV-GFP infection was blocked. As a control, we also showed that TRIM5αhu KD

178

cells were susceptible to B-tropic murine leukemia virus GFP (B-MLV-GFP),

179

which is not restricted by TRIM5αhu (Figure 3A). These results confirmed that KD

180

of TRIM5αhu expression was successfully achieved.

181

Next, we assessed the infection phenotype observed in Jurkat TRIM5αhu

182

KD cells when CypA-capsid interactions are disrupted (Figure 3B). Surprisingly,

183

TRIM5αhu KD cells treated with CsA did not show marked inhibition of HIV-1

184

infection compared with control cells (Figure 3B), suggesting that TRIM5αhu is

185

involved in the inhibition of viral infection observed in CsA-treated cells that have

186

disrupted CypA-capsid interactions.

187
188

HIV-1-P90A is a mutant form of HIV-1 in which CypA-capsid interactions
are disrupted during infection. We tested whether HIV-1-P90A infection was

189

inhibited in TRIM5αhu KD Jurkat cells. As shown in Figure 3C, we found that HIV-

190

1-P90A infection was not inhibited in TRIM5αhu KD cells compared with control

191

cells. This result supports our hypothesis that expression of TRIM5αhu is

192

important for the infection phenotype observed when CypA-capsid interactions

193

are disrupted. It is possible that CypA prevents the binding of TRIM5αhu to the

194

HIV-1 core via steric hindrance, thus protecting the core from the restriction

195

factor during the early steps of infection.

196
197
198

CypA prevents the interaction of TRIM5α hu with the HIV-1 core.
To test whether CypA modulates the binding of TRIM5αhu to the HIV-1

199

core, we analyzed the binding of TRIM5αhu to the HIV-1 core in the presence of

200

CsA, which binds to endogenously expressed CypA in cellular extracts and

201

prevents CypA binding to the HIV-1 core. As shown in Figure 4A, TRIM5αhu

202

binding to the HIV-1 core increased 3- to 4-fold in the presence of CsA. We also

203

found that the binding of TRIM5αhu to mutant P90A HIV-1 cores was 5- to 6-fold

204

higher than that of wild-type HIV-1 cores (Figure 4A) in the absence or presence

205

of CsA. These results suggested that CypA prevents the binding of TRIM5αhu to

206

the HIV-1 core during infection. It is possible that CypA and TRIM5αhu compete

207

with each other to interact with the incoming core. To test this hypothesis, we

208

investigated whether the addition of exogenous CypA decreased TRIM5αhu

209

binding to the HIV-1 core. For this purpose, we assessed the ability of TRIM5αhu

210

from cellular extracts to bind to the HIV-1 core in the presence of 10 µg of

211

recombinant CypA protein. We found that the addition of recombinant CypA

212

significantly decreased the binding of TRIM5αhu to the HIV-1 core (Figure 4B). As

213

expected, recombinant CypA did not affect the binding of TRIM5αhu to HIV-1

214

cores bearing the P90A mutation. Overall, these results suggested that CypA

215

protects the core from the restriction factor TRIM5αhu.

216
217

Mutant HIV-1 strains that are impaired for capsid-TRIM5α hu interactions are

218

insensitive to CsA treatment.

219

Previous studies have shown that infection of Jurkat cells by the HIV-1

220

strain bearing the capsid mutation A92E (HIV-1-A92E-GFP) was less sensitive to

221

CsA treatment when compared with wild-type HIV-1 (Hatziioannou et al., 2005;

222

Sokolskaja et al., 2004). Consistent with these findings, we observed that HIV-1-

223

A92E infection of Jurkat cells was insensitive to CsA treatment (Figure 5A). This

224

insensitivity may occur due to one or both of the following scenarios: 1) HIV-1-

225

A92E may have a higher affinity for CypA, which may better protect the virus

226

from TRIM5αhu, and 2) HIV-1-A92E may have a lower affinity for TRIM5αhu,

227

which may prevent inhibition of infection. To explore these possibilities, we tested

228

the ability of CypA to interact with HIV-1 cores containing the A92E capsid

229

mutation. We found that CypA did not bind to the mutant A92E core, which

230

suggested no or poor interaction between HIV-1-A92E and CypA during infection

231

(Figure 5B). As a control, we showed that the binding of CypA to wild-type HIV-1

232

cores was CsA-sensitive (Figure 5B). Because CypA does not bind to HIV-1-

233

A92E, a stronger binding between HIV-1-A92E and TRIM5αhu may result in

234

inhibition of infection. However, we found that the infection of Jurkat cells by HIV-

235

1-A92E was not affected when compared with that of wild-type HIV-1 (Figure

236

5A), suggesting that HIV-1-A92E may be unable to interact with TRIM5αhu.

237

Consistent with our hypothesis, TRIM5αhu did not interact with mutant HIV-1

238

cores bearing the capsid change A92E (Figure 5C). Overall, these results

239

indicated that mutant HIV-1 A92E cores bind neither CypA nor TRIM5αhu, which

240

may explain the reason that CsA treatment does not affect HIV-1-A92E infection

241

of Jurkat cells.

242
243

CypA-capsid interactions are required for HIV-1 infection of human PBMCs

244

and CD4+ T cells.

245

To understand the role of CypA in HIV-1 infection of human primary

246

PBMCs, we challenged PBMCs and CD4+ T cells from different donors with HIV-

247

1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of CsA, which prevents the

248

binding of CypA to HIV-1 capsid (Diaz-Griffero et al., 2006; Luban et al., 1993).

249

As shown in Figure S1, CsA treatment inhibited HIV-1 infection in PBMCs and

250

CD4+ T cells. This result suggested that CypA-capsid interactions are required

251

for HIV-1 infection of human PBMCs and CD4+ T cells. To further corroborate

252

these findings, we challenged human PBMCs and CD4+ T cells with increasing

253

amounts of HIV-1 particles bearing the capsid mutations P90A and G89V, both of

254

which prevent CypA-capsid interactions (Gamble et al., 1996; Thali et al., 1994).

255

Infection was determined by measuring the percentage of GFP-positive cells at

256

48 h post-infection. Wild-type and mutant HIV-1-GFP viruses were normalized by

257

quantifying the levels of p24. We found that HIV-1-P90A and HIV-1-G89V were

258

unable to infect human PBMCs and CD4+ T cells (Figure 6A and B). Although

259

this experiment was performed in PBMCs and CD4+ T cells obtained from six

260

different donors, all of which showed the same results, we have only shown

261

sample results obtained from three donors. Our results suggested that CypA-

262

capsid interactions are required for HIV-1 infection in human primary PBMCs and

263

CD4+ T cells. Importantly, the lack of CypA appeared to have a stronger effect on

264

HIV-1 infection in primary human lymphocytes compared with that in Jurkat cells

265

(Figures 1B and 6A&B), thus indicating that CypA was crucial for HIV-1 infection

266

of human primary cells. Overall, these results suggested that the disruption of

267

CypA-capsid interaction is detrimental for HIV-1 infection of PBMCs and CD4+ T

268

cells.

269
270

Disruption of HIV-1 binding to TRIM5α hu does not affect viral infection in

271

human PBMCs and CD4+ T cells.

272

Mutant HIV-1 bearing the capsid change A92E lacks the ability to interact

273

with TRIM5αhu. We examined the ability of HIV-1-A92E to infect PBMCs and

274

CD4+ T cells to study the role of TRIM5αhu during viral infection in these cells.

275

Consistent with the results observed in Jurkat cells, HIV-1-A92E infection levels

276

were comparable to that of wild-type HIV-1 in human PBMCs (Figure 7A). As a

277

control, we also challenged PBMCs with increasing concentrations of HIV-1-

278

P90A, an HIV-1 mutant that is completely inhibited in PBMCs (Figure 7A). We

279

observed similar results when we challenged CD4+ T cells using HIV-1-A92E

280

(Figure 7B). Consistent with our previous binding experiments, we found that

281

HIV-1-A92E infection of PBMCs and CD4+ T cells was not affected by TRIM5αhu,

282

which correlated with the inability of TRIM5αhu to bind to mutant HIV-1-A92E

283

cores.

284
285

Depletion of CypA expression in human CD4+ T cells inhibits HIV-1

286

infection.

287

We have previously shown that CypA-capsid interactions are important for

288

HIV-1 infection. To directly test the role of CypA in viral infection, we challenged

289

CypA knockout CD4+ T cells with HIV-1NL4-3-GFP. To create CypA knockouts,

290

CD4+ T cells were separately electroporated with CRISPR/Cas9 complexes

containing five different guides against CypA (CypA-KO#1–5). Expression of

292

CypA was analyzed by western blotting using anti-CypA antibodies at 3 days

293

post-electroporation. As shown in Figure 8A, all five guides were able to

294

eliminate the expression of CypA. The CypA knockout cells were then challenged

295

with HIV-1NL4-3-GFP. Consistent with our previous results, human CD4+ T cells

296

depleted for CypA expression were resistant to HIV-1 infection (the results from

297

two donors are shown in Figure 8B). As a control, we used a CRISPR/Cas9

298

complex containing an RNA guide for CXCR4, which completely inhibits infection

299

of HIV-1NL4-3-GFP. We also used a CRISPR/Cas9 complex containing a non-

300

targeting RNA guide. These results demonstrated that CypA expression is

301

essential for HIV-1 infection in human primary CD4+ T cells.

CypA-capsid interactions are required for efficient HIV-1 reverse

304

transcription in human CD4+ T cells.

305

Our analysis showed that HIV-1 strains bearing capsid mutations that

306

disrupt CypA-capsid interactions are unable to infect human CD4+ T cells. To

307

identify the step in the HIV-1 life cycle at which infection is disrupted, we

308

challenged human CD4+ T cells with p24-normalized levels of GFP expressed by

309

wild-type and capsid mutant HIV-1 particles, and measured reverse transcription,

310

nuclear import, and integration using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

311

(Figure 9). Infection was measured by determining the percentage of GFP-

312

positive cells at 72 h post-infection (Figure 9A). Consistent with our previous

313

results, HIV-1-P90A and HIV-1-G89V strains showed weak infection in CD4+ T

314

cells (Figure 9A). Reverse transcription was measured by determining the levels

315

of late reverse transcripts (LRT) at 10 h post-infection (Figure 9B). Interestingly,

316

reverse transcription was reduced in HIV-1-P90A and HIV-1-G89V, suggesting

317

that CypA-capsid interactions were important for HIV-1 reverse transcription in

318

CD4+ T cells. As a control, we used Nevirapine (Nev), which inhibits reverse

319

transcription (Figure 9B). For nuclear import, we measured the levels of 2-long

320

terminal repeat (2-LTR) circles at 24 h post-infection (Figure 9C). Consistent with

321

a reverse transcription block, our results showed that both viruses were blocked

322

for nuclear import. Viral integration was determined using Alu-PCR at 48 h post-

323

infection (Figure 9D). As a control, the integration inhibitor Raltegravir (Ral) was

324

also used. As expected, the integration of HIV-1-P90A and HIV-1-G89V was

325

blocked. Overall, these results suggested that HIV-1 requires interaction with

CypA in order to undergo efficient reverse transcription in human CD4+ T cells.

These results also suggested that in the absence of CypA, HIV-1 particles are

exposed to TRIM5αhu, which inhibits reverse transcription.

DISCUSSION
A few years after the discovery of HIV-1 capsid interaction with CypA

351

(Luban et al., 1993), it was established that CsA treatment disrupted this

352

interaction, which then affected HIV-1 infectivity. It was soon realized that CsA

353

exerted varying effects on HIV-1 infection depending upon the human cell lines

354

used. Although CypA-capsid interactions have been studied for over 25 years,

355

the mechanism by which CsA affects HIV-1 infection remains elusive. Here, we

356

explored the role of CypA-capsid interactions in human lymphocytes.

357

Several recent studies have suggested that TRIM5αhu may function as an

358

HIV-1 restriction factor (Jimenez-Guardeno et al., 2019; OhAinle et al., 2018).

359

This led us to hypothesize that TRIM5αhu binds to the HIV-1 core, which was

360

proven by our results. Remarkably, we observed that TRIM5αhu showed stronger

361

binding to the HIV-1 core than TRIM5αrh. Because TRIM5αhu and CypA both bind

362

to the HIV-1 core, it is possible that these two factors compete for the HIV-1 core

363

during infection⎯CypA may modulate the binding of TRIM5αhu to the HIV-1 core

364

or vice versa. We showed that the depletion of TRIM5αhu expression rescued the

365

HIV-1 infectivity phenotype in Jurkat cells caused by the disruption of CypA-

366

capsid interactions. In cellular extracts, we also observed that CsA treatment

367

increased binding of TRIM5αhu to the HIV-1 core. These results were consistent

368

with our hypothesis that CypA modulates the binding of TRIM5αhu to the HIV-1

369

core. The results of the binding experiments suggested that CypA sterically

370

hinders the binding of TRIM5αhu to the HIV-1 core, which could explain the

371

observed infectivity phenotype when CypA-capsid interactions were disrupted in

372

lymphocytes. Conversely, we also demonstrated that increasing the amounts of

373

CypA prevented the binding of TRIM5αhu to the HIV-1 core. Based on these

374

results, we propose that the prevention of CypA binding allows TRIM5αhu to bind

375

to the HIV-1 core, consequently inhibiting infection.

376

Our results indicated that the interaction of TRIM5αhu with the HIV-1 core

377

leads to restriction of infection. However, several previous studies have shown

378

that overexpression of TRIM5αhu has little or no effect on HIV-1 infection (Li et al.,

379

2006; Pham et al., 2010; Yap et al., 2005). One possibility is that restriction of

380

HIV-1 infection by TRIM5αhu requires a specific cellular cofactor expressed only

381

in Jurkat cells and human primary lymphocytes. This cofactor may have been

382

absent or present only in insufficient amounts in other human cell lines that were

383

used for TRIM5αhu overexpression experiments. The search for this type of

384

cofactors in the future is warranted. Alternatively, TRIM5αhu might be recruited to

385

the HIV-1 core by other TRIM proteins through the formation of higher-order

386

complexes (Diaz-Griffero et al., 2009); TRIM5α dimers are known to associate

387

with other dimers and form higher-order self-association complexes. For

388

example, TRIM5αrh forms higher-order complexes with human TRIM34 and

389

TRIM6 (Li et al., 2011). Alternatively, TRIM5αhu might recruit other human TRIM

390

orthologs that are important for restriction. Future studies will explore the

391

existence of other human TRIM orthologs that may form higher-order complexes

392

with TRIM5αhu.

393
394

Mutations in the CypA-binding loop of the capsid, such as P90A and
G89V, cause an infectivity defect similar to that caused by CsA treatment during

395

wild-type HIV-1 infection of Jurkat cells; however, infection of HIV-1 viruses

396

bearing the capsid change A92E are insensitive to CsA treatment in Jurkat cells

397

(Hatziioannou et al., 2005; Sokolskaja et al., 2004). Here, we showed that this

398

insensitivity was due to the lack of TRIM5αhu binding to HIV-1-A92E mutant

399

cores. Normal viral infectivity correlated with the inability of TRIM5αhu to bind to

400

HIV-1-A92E cores. Additionally, the HIV-1-A92E mutant core also did not interact

401

with CypA, indicating that the A92E mutation abolishes interaction of the HIV-1

402

core with both TRIM5αhu and CypA. Based on these results, it is possible that

403

TRIM5αhu binds to the CypA-binding loop or in its proximity.

404

The disruption of CypA-capsid interactions had a stronger effect on viral

405

infectivity in human primary cells compared with Jurkat cells. Mutant HIV-1 (P90A

406

or G89V) infection of PBMCs or CD4+ T cells was 10–20 fold weaker than that of

407

wild-type HIV-1. Similarly, KD of CypA expression in human primary CD4+ T cells

408

potently blocked HIV-1 infection. In contrast, HIV-1-A92E infection of primary

409

lymphocytes was not affected when compared to that of wild-type HIV-1. Taken

410

together, these results suggested that TRIM5αhu blocks HIV-1 infection of human

411

primary lymphocytes when CypA-capsid interactions are disrupted. Consistent

412

with this idea, we observed that the inhibition of infection caused by the

413

disruption of CypA-capsid interactions in CD4+ T cells occurred prior to HIV-1

414

reverse transcription.

415

Our work has shown that CypA protects the core from TRIM5αhu.

416

Intriguingly, new- and old-world monkeys express a protein in which the TRIM

417

domain of TRIM5α and CypA form a fusion protein (Brennan et al., 2008;

418

Newman et al., 2008; Sayah et al., 2004). Based on our results, it is possible that

419

evolution may have taken advantage of a positive factor, in this case CypA, and

420

fused to the TRIM domain to develop a restriction factor.

421

Overall, this work showed the mechanism by which disruption of CypA-

422

capsid interactions affect HIV-1 infection of human primary lymphocytes. Future

423

experiments will explore whether a similar mechanism operates in macrophages

424

or dendritic cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

465

Cell lines and drugs

466

Human Jurkat lymphocytes cells obtained from the American type culture

467

collection (ATCC) were grown at 37°C in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)

468

medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-

469

streptomycin. Human 293T (ATCC) cells were grown at 37°C in Dulbecco’s

470

modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-

471

streptomycin. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)

472

to create a stock of 10 mM.

473
474
475

Infection using HIV-1-GFP reporter viruses
Recombinant human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) strains such as

476

HIV-1-G89V, HIV-1-P90A, and HIV-1-A92E expressing GFP were prepared as

477

previously described (Diaz-Griffero et al., 2008). Viral challenges were performed

478

in 24-well plates by infecting 50,000 cells (Jurkat, PBMCs, or CD4+ T cells) per

479

well. Infection was determined by measuring the percentage of GFP-positive

480

cells using flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson).

481
482

Capsid expression and purification

483

pET-11a vectors were used to express the HIV-1 capsid protein containing

484

the A14C and E45C mutations. Point mutations P90A and A92E were introduced

485

using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to

486

the manufacturer's instructions. All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli

487

one-shoot BL21star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen), as previously described (Selyutina et

488

al., 2018). Briefly, cells were inoculated in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and

489

cultured at 30°C until mid-log phase (A600, 0.6–0.8). Protein expression was

490

induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at

491

18°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and

492

pellets were stored at −80°C until purification. Purification of capsids was carried

493

out as follows: pellets from 2 L of Luria containing bacteria were lysed by

494

sonication (Qsonica microtip: 4420; A = 45; 2 min; 2 sec on; 2 sec off for 12

495

cycles), in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH = 8, 50 mM NaCl, 100 mM β-

496

mercaptoethanol, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets). Cell

497

debris was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Proteins

498

from the supernatant were precipitated by incubation with one-third the volume of

499

saturated ammonium sulfate containing 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at

500

4°C, and centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Precipitated proteins were

501

resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (25 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid

502

(MES) pH 6.5 and 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated 2–3 times

503

(Qsonica microtip: 4420; A = 45; 2 min; 1 sec on; 2 sec off). The protein sample

504

was dialyzed three times in buffer A (2 h, overnight, 2 h), sonicated, diluted in

505

500 ml of buffer A, and was chromatographed sequentially on a 5-ml HiTrap Q

506

HP column and on a 5-ml HiTrap SP FF column (GE Healthcare), which were

507

both pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The capsid protein was eluted from the

508

HiTrap SP FF column using a linear gradient of concentrations ranging from 0–2

509

M NaCl. The eluted fraction that had highest protein levels was selected based

510

on absorbance at 280 nm. Pooled fractions were dialyzed three times (2 h,

511

overnight, 2 h) in storage buffer (25 mM MES, 2 M NaCl, 20 mM β-

512

mercaptoethanol). The sample was reduced to a concentration of 20 mg/ml using

513

Centricon and stored at ˗80°C.

514
515

Assembly of stabilized HIV-1 capsid tubes

516

One milliliter of monomeric capsid (5 mg/ml) was dialyzed in SnakeSkin

517

dialysis tubing 10K MWCO (Thermo Scientific) using a buffer that is high in salt

518

and contains a reducing agent (buffer 1: 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 100 mM β-

519

mercaptoethanol) at 4°C for 8 h. Subsequently the protein was dialyzed using

520

buffer 1 without the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol (buffer 2: 50 mM Tris, pH

521

8, 1 M NaCl) at 4°C for 8 h. The absence of β-mercaptoethanol in the second

522

dialysis allows the formation of disulfide bonds between Cysteine 14 and 45

523

inter-capsid monomers in the hexamer. Finally, the protein was dialyzed using

524

buffer 3 (20 mM Tris, pH 8,0, 40 mM NaCl) at 4°C for 8 h. Assembled complexes

525

were kept at 4°C for up to 1 month.

Capsid binding assay protocol.
Human HEK293T cells were transfected for 24 h with a plasmid

529

expressing the protein of interest (TRIM5αhu,TRIM5αrh, or CypA). The cell

530

medium was completely removed and cells were scraped off the plate and lysed

531

in 300 µl of capsid binding buffer (CBB: 10 mM Tris, pH 8,0, 1,5 mM MgCl2, 10

532

mM KCl). Cells were rotated at 4°C for 15 min and then centrifuged to remove

533

cellular debris (21,000 × g ,15 min, 4°C). Cell lysates were incubated with

534

stabilized HIV-1 capsid tubes for 1 h at 25°C. Subsequently, the stabilized HIV-1

535

capsid tubes were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 2 min. Pellets were washed 2-3

536

times by resuspension and centrifugation in CBB or phosphate-buffered saline

537

(PBS). Pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer 1× and analyzed by western

538

blot using anti-p24 and the indicated antibodies.

541

Preparation of PBMCs and CD4+ T cells
PBMCs from healthy donor whole blood were isolated by density gradient

542

centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Health Care, #17-1440-02). 40 ml of

543

whole blood was centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min, and the plasma layer was

544

removed and replaced with Hank’s Balanced Salt solution (HBSS; Sigma Aldrich,

545

#H6648). The whole blood was then diluted to a ratio of 1:2 with HBSS with 20

546

ml of the diluted blood layered on top of 20 ml Ficoll-Paque Plus and centrifuged

547

at 300 × g for 30 min. The resulting whitish buffy coat layer was collected,

548

washed twice with HBSS, and resuspended in 10 RPMI medium containing 10%

549

(vol/vol) FBS and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin, and activated with IL-2

550

(100 U/ml) (Human IL-2; Cell Signaling Technology, #8907SF) and

551

phytohemagglutinin (1 µg/ml) for 3 days. CD4+ T cells were obtained via negative

552

selection from PBMCs using a human CD4+ T-cell isolation kit (MACS Miltenyi

553

Biotec, #130-096-533). Per 1 × 107 total cells, PBMCs were resuspended in 40 µl

554

CD4+ T-cell isolation buffer (PBS, pH 7.2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mM

555

EDTA). Ten microliters of CD4+ T-cell biotin-antibody cocktail was then added

556

and incubated at 4°C for 5 min. Thirty microliters of CD4+ T-cell isolation buffer

557

and 20 µl of CD4+ T-cell microbead cocktail were then added and further

558

incubated for 10 min at 4°C. Depending on the amount of PBMCs isolated, LS

559

Column (MACS Miltenyi Biotec, #130-042-401) or MS Column (MACS Miltenyi

560

Biotec, #130-042-201) attached to a MACS Separator was pre-washed with 3 ml

561

or 6 ml of ice-cold CD4+ T-cell isolation buffer, respectively. PBMC suspension

562

was added to the column and the flow-through was collected in a 15-ml tube. The

563

LS or MS Columns were then washed with 3 ml or 6 ml of ice-cold CD4+ T-cell

564

isolation buffer, respectively, and the flow-through was collected. The newly

565

isolated CD4+ T cells were then centrifuged at 800 x g for 5 min and resuspended

566

in RPMI medium supplemented with IL-2 (100 U/ml).

568

Knockdown of TRIM5α hu expression in Jurkat cells

569

Lentiviral particles were produced in human 293T cells by co-transfection

570

of 1 µg TAT, 1 µg REV, 1.5 µg VSVG, 1 µg HDM(codon optimized gag-pol), and

571

7.5 µg of the lentiviral vector pLKO1, or 7.5 µg the pLKO1 vector containing an

572

shRNA that targets TRIM5αhu (pLKO1-shRNA-TRIM5αhu). Viruses were

573

harvested at 48 h post-transfection and used to transduce Jurkat cells for 5 days

574

at a 1:1 virus to complete media ratio. Transduced cells were selected in 0.15

575

µg/ml of puromycin. Cells that stably contained pLKO1 or pLKO1-shRNA-

576

TRIM5αhu were maintained in puromycin. Expression of TRIM5αhu was evaluated

577

by challenging the cells with N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV) and B-tropic

578

murine leukemia virus (B-MLV).

CRISPR-Cas9 RNP Production, CD4+ T Cell Isolation, and Electroporation
Detailed protocols for RNP production and primary CD4+ T cell editing

582

have been previously published (Hultquist et al., 2016). Briefly, lyophilized crRNA

583

and tracrRNA (Dharmacon) were suspended at a concentration of 160 µM in 10

584

mM Tris-HCL (7.4 pH) with 150 mM KCl. 5µL of 160µM crRNA was mixed with

585

5µL of 160µM tracrRNA and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The gRNA:tracrRNA

586

complexes were then mixed gently with 10µL of 40µM Cas9 (UC-Berkeley

587

Macrolab) to form Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Five 3.5µL aliquots were

588

frozen in Lo-Bind 96-well V-bottom plates (E&K Scientific) at -80°C until use. All

589

crRNA guide sequences used in this study were derived from the Dharmacon

590

pre-designed Edit-R library for gene knock-out, including the non-targeting (U-

591

007502, U-007501) and CYPA-targeting guides (CM-004979-01 through CM-

592

004979-05).

593

Primary human CD4+ T cells from healthy donors were isolated from

605

supplemented with 20 IU/mL IL-2 (Miltenyi) immediately before use. For

606

activation, bulk CD4+ T cells were immediately plated on anti-CD3 coated plates

607

[coated for 2 hours at 37°C with 20µg/mL anti-CD3 (UCHT1, Tonbo Biosciences)]

608

in the presence of 5µg/mL soluble anti-CD28 (CD28.2, Tonbo Biosciences). Cells

609

were stimulated for 72 hours at 37°C / 5% CO2 prior to electroporation.

610

Each electroporation reaction consisted of 4x10^5 T cells, 3.5 µL RNP,

611

and 20 µL electroporation buffer. After three days of stimulation, cells were

612

suspended and counted. RNPs were thawed and allowed to come to room-

613

temperature. Immediately prior to electroporation, cells were centrifuged at 400xg

614

for 5 minutes, supernatant was removed by aspiration, and the pellet was

615

resuspended in 20 µL of room-temperature P3 electroporation buffer (Lonza) per

616

reaction. 20 µL of cell suspension was then gently mixed with each RNP and

617

aliquoted into a 96-well electroporation cuvette for nucleofection with the 4D 96-

618

well shuttle unit (Lonza) using pulse code EH-115. Immediately after

619

electroporation, 80 µL of pre-warmed media without IL-2 was added to each well
