Natural biological structures are often complex and cannot be mapped directly to
genes, being therefore impossible to explore by traditional biological tools. In contrast,
digitizing these structures enables to explore their properties and behavior under specific
conditions, by means of computational manipulations, simulations, and analyses. We
describe a generic algorithm for the digitization and exploration of the complex structures
exhibited by common, interwoven bird nests. This algorithm takes as input computerized
tomographic scans of the studied Dead-Sea Sparrow (Passer moabiticus) nest, identifies and
isolates each branch entity within the three-dimensional data and finally extracts the
characteristics of each branch. The result is a reliable three-dimensional numerical model
of the nest that contains a complete geometric dataset per each of its components, e.g.
dimensions and contact points with neighboring components, as well as global properties,
e.g. density distribution and network structure. Based on these, we were able to simulate
various models of the nest construction process. Altogether, the described algorithm and
possible derivatives thereof could be a valuable tool in studying the structure-function
relationships of similarly complex biological objects.

The field of structural biology is concerned with the relationships between structure and
function of biological objects, mainly at the molecular level. Testing specific hypotheses
regarding these relationships is typically done by altering the structures using traditional
experimental techniques such as genetic mutations, and measuring the consequent behavior of
the object under study1. However, complex biological structures at the macro-scale level, such as
animal made structures, e.g termite mounds2, orb webs3, and bird nests4, that presumably have a
genetic basis, are challenging and often impossible to explore this way, since there is no simple
injective mapping between genotype and phenotype.

While such macro-scale biological structures cannot be studied by traditional biological
tools, their structure-function relationships can be studied in-silico in digital formats. Digitizing
complex structures by converting the objects using three dimensional (3D) imaging techniques,

such as 3D scanning, computer tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into
numerical (digital) model representations, enables to explore their properties and behaviour
under specific conditions, by means of computational manipulations, simulations, and analyses5–
8. These structures may be 3D printed prior to generating digital manipulations to further explore
the structure, e.g by means of mechanical testing9. To obtain numerical representation in form of
3D solid or surface models from medical imaging modalities, a computer-based image
reconstruction is carried out on a set of two dimensional (2D) tomograms. Digital analysis of the
data and 3D models obtained from the actual biological structures provides us with a definitive
description of the studied structures.

Computational modeling has greatly augmented our understanding of the role of structure
on biological function, and is now a growing strategy for biomechanics and medical research,
with recent advances in model development and simulation platforms leading to growing
contributions in medicine and comparative biomechanical studies10. The popularity of digital
analyses may be due to many factors, from their ability to provide robust quantitative analyses
for complex and intricate structures often found in biological systems, to the ability of numerical
methods such as Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Finite element analysis (FEA) to
provide colossal amounts of output data, allowing robust statistical analyses and detailed
graphical displays.

Digitized structures enables us to simulate and predict how a structure will perform in
natural or under changed operating conditions and investigate the effect of induced structural
modifications on the natural function. For example, frontal sinuses in goats and other mammals
are assumed to function as shock absorbers, protecting the brain from blows during intraspecific
combat. Generating 3D models of domesticated goat (Capra hircus) skull with variable frontal
bone and frontal sinus morphologies and simulating loading scenarios using the finite element
method (FEM) shows how morphological modifications affect distribution of stresses in the
skull11. Another study shows the effects of deteriorated trabecular bone structure on bone
stiffness and strength by generating healthy 3D printed trabecular bone model and comparing it
with the same model after bone resorption was simulated. Since the deteriorated structural bone
model is derived from the healthy one, it is possible to directly estimate the decrease of tissue
stiffness and strength as a result of bone resorption for the specific structure12. These studies
show how digitizing biological structures is beneficial for understanding and evaluating the
performance of complex natural structures.

The physical structure of biological structures often reflects their assembly and function.
Bird nests are no exception, containing numerous interwoven components with structural
stability of the architecture depending mainly upon the structural organization of the components
and their material properties. Avian nests are essential for reproductive success, providing a
location for rearing the young and safely supporting the incubating bird and its clutch of eggs13.
Nests have been shown to be constructed out of a wide variety of organic and artificial building
materials14, which can generally be classified as being either structural materials or lining
materials. While structural materials make up the general shape of the nest and provide structural
support for the parents and offspring, lining materials generally create a suitable microclimate for
raising offspring15,16. It is assumed that building materials within different parts of a nest are not
randomly selected and appear to have a structural role17. Recent studies have tried to determine
the construction patterns of nests and the factors that affect nest construction both examining the

building materials and their mechanical properties17. Studying nest construction is primarily
performed by means of deconstruction and characterization of its components to relate the
composition of the nest regions to their function17,18. Consequently, someone who is interested in
rebuilding the structure or performing mechanical tests to study its biomechanics properties, will
likely be at a disadvantage. Developing in-silico nest models based on actual nest structures can
be labor intensive and time consuming, nevertheless the change from physical to digital data has
made possible to perform numerous experiments and model modifications. Digitizing scanned
nests and classifying each branch entity, can be done with semi-automated and manual
segmentation approaches. Yet, this approach is not feasible due to similarity in material
properties of branch components, which results in a challenging and time-consuming task of
separating between nest components.

The goal of this study is to design and implement an algorithm that is capable of precisely
mapping the structure of interwoven birds nests, a relatively complex task due to the intricate
multipart structure. In this method we take CT scans of interwoven birds nests as an input,
identify the nest structure within the 3D data using image processing and thinning techniques.
The novel algorithm is then used to isolate each branch entity. Finally the characteristics of each
branch are extracted and used for statistical analysis of the structure and for generating graphical
visualizations and simulations of construction patterns. Better understanding the relationship
between structure and function can be done by breaking down the nest into the elements
comprising it and studying how each branch affects the architecture as a whole. Mutating the
nest structure by elongating, trimming, or removing components, results in new models that can
be used in comparative simulations for studying the structure stability and investigate bird nests
building techniques.

We used Dead-Sea Sparrow (Passer moabiticus) compound nests built by assembling
branch components (Fig. 1A). The studied Dead-Sea Sparrow nests are relatively large,
assembled by thick elements with a mean branch thickness of 2.6mm, being an advantage in the
following computational analysis. A case study was carried out to illustrate and evaluate the
proposed method. Figure 1B shows a schematic overview of the method. This algorithm was
designed in a pipeline pattern, starting from the image sequence, passing through different filters
to achieve the final nest numerical model. In each step and sub-step (Supplementary Fig S1),
the intermediate result is written to a file, to allow easy management of the complex and
computationally-intensive process.

To digitize and explore the complex structures exhibited by common interwoven bird
nests, we used our method to optimally take computerized tomography (CT) scans of the studied
nests as an input, and identify and isolate the 3D structure. This method first analyzes the
greyscale CT derived datasets using a slice-by-slice segmentation process to identify potential

isometric voxels (i.e., the voxels are cuboids instead of cubes) (Fig. 1D). The resolution
was found to be sufficient for analyzing the individual nest components and identifying the
nests’ architecture. CT datasets are imported into FIJI19 with a background type of 8-bit unsigned
integer (Fig. 1E). The datasets are preprocessed using image processing filters, which are used
for noise reduction and averaging. The filters include a neighbourhood averaging 3D filter in the
z axis (�=5), and a 3D Gaussian Blur filter (�=1) (Fig. 1F). Following preprocessing a new
datasets was generated for yielding the structure skeleton. Since branches appear in a
considerable variation of diameters (1.2 mm to 8.8 mm) a range of intensity thresholds are tested
to optimally identify all branches. The optimal threshold cut off value is one that reduces image
noise while preserving maximum significant image data (T=28) (Supplementary Fig. S2). As
this image sequence is next skeletonized, it is crucial to eliminate inner branch cavities to ensure
that the skeletonization process would not fail to describe the actual branch geometry. Thus, a
hole filling operation is applied for filling branches with inner voids or small hollow regions due
to local image noise. Finally, a 3D thinning algorithm is applied20,21 to obtain the structure’s
skeleton, from which the 3D centerlines of individual branches are to be identified.

The thinning process does not identify touching branches as separate entities. Rather, in
the resulting skeleton, branch centerlines may be connected with bridges that originate from
contact regions between branches (Fig 2A). Figures 2A-D show the approach as applied to a
sample of branches. A generalized method was designed to identify true and false branches. The
algorithm was developed to optimally break the entire skeleton structure into simple edges by
eliminating all junctions and forks. The skeleton is first cleaned by pruning tail edges, using an
iterative elimination process with a predefined length threshold (T=5mm). Next, all junctions are
identified (black arrowheads) and pruned out of the structure, this is done by removing pixels
(equivalent to 2mm) off each junction edge, resulting in a simplified structure that contains
simple edges only (no forks). As this process eliminates both true and false junctions, it is
necessary to reconstruct the true junctions. Various separation and connection scenarios were
considered for the development of the algorithm (Supplementary Fig. S3). A matching
algorithm is then applied to rate the correlation between endpoints p of branches oriented in a
predefined proximity (Fig. 2E). To systematically assess whether two segments originate from
the same branch, we calculate branch friendship score C via

Where D is the distance between the endpoints, orientation difference A is measured as the
spatial angle between the orientation vectors v with180 ‒ ∢(𝑣1,𝑣2), in which an angle of zero
represents a perfect orientation match. The distances d1 and d2 are measured between p1 and v1,
and p2 and v2 respectively. Angles a1 and a2 are measured between the vector 𝑝1→𝑝2 and v1
and v2 respectively. Finally, the thickness t of each branch is recorded. The friendship score is
therefore inversely related with correlation between two endpoints. These parameters often
exhibit non-proportional effect on the score, requiring an enforcement of cutoff values before
plugging them into the formula. If a parameters value is smaller than a certain minimum it is
replaced with the predefined value. For D and d minimum values of 1.0 and 0.5 were enforced
respectively. The value enforced on t2/t1 is 0.1 and T is 3. The actual implementation of the
scoring formula can be seen in Supplementary Fig. S4. Highly correlated branches are

iteratively linked combining two edges into a single edge (Fig, 2C), and finally short edges are
removed (Fig. 2D). This is based on the assumption that highly correlated edges originate from
the same branch. The preliminary result of the python code is a list of skeletonized branches,
where each branch is described as a set of voxels.

To calculate branch thickness we used an additional binary data set derived from the
original CT scan. The original dataset is preprocessed using a 2D Gaussian Blur filter (�=2)
(Fig. 1G). Testing a range of threshold intensities reveals an optimal cutoff threshold value
(T=24), that provides binary images from which branch thicknesses can be extracted. The
threshold cutoff value is selected by measuring the thickness of several branches and comparing
the diameters to scanned images after thresholding, therefore obtaining true thickness values.
Branch thickness is analyzed at each skeleton point, by superpositioning the skeleton and the
binary image sets. Measured diameter is then added to each voxel unit. An algorithm is applied
to clean out branches with zero thickness, and assign thickness to short branch segments with
zero thickness. Finally, a constant thickness value is documented for each branch by calculating
the median thickness of sample points along the branch.

Contact points between branches are identified by measuring the distance between branch
surfaces, as the distance between the skeleton points and branch diameter is known. We were
able to efficiently produce visualization of the reconstructed nests and qualitatively assess the
accuracy of the reconstruction done by the algorithm as well as print 3D models of the nests
Supplementary Fig. S5. This analysis reveals both visually and quantitatively the distribution of
twig length, thickness and degree of connectivity across different parts of the nest (Fig. 3A-D).
The findings show that the nest is comprised of 739 branches with a large contact network of 208
intersection points, connecting the branches in the structure (Fig. 4A).

To investigate variations in construction patterns, we used different building algorithms
to test alternatives for constructing avian structures. Our method describes the nest as a directed
network, where centers of branches are marked as spheres. Spheres size correlates with branches
diameter and edges connecting between spheres resemble contact points between branches (Fig.
4A).

Based on this result, we created a first algorithm, GREEDY, that automatically identifies
the contact points from the contact network and assigns each branch with a value—gravityconnected—defined by the magnitude of the link between branches and their relationship to the
gravity vector. GREEDY first identifies the structures scaffold, usually the thickest branches
originally attached to the tree. Each branch in turn is added, when in each step the branch that is
most gravity-connected (i.e. the most structurally supported branch by the already constructed
structure) is added to the existing structure. A second algorithm was then created, GRADUAL,
that automatically identifies the contact points from the contact network and assigns each branch
with two values, gravity-connected and gravity connectivity. GRADUAL first identifies the
structures scaffold. Each branch in turn is added, when in each step the branch that is least
gravity-connected and has gravity-connectivity to stay put due to friction with other branches, is
added to the existing structure. GREEDY and GRADUAL reach the final nest in very similar
trajectories in terms of cumulative nest mass (Fig. 4B). However, in GREEDY, the branches in
the center of the nest, that have several contact points, are first to be placed, followed by the
external branches (Fig. 4C). In contrast, GRADUAL results in a more complex process that first

Despite the advancement in computational modeling and numerical analyses tools
available to date, simulation studies overall adoption rate have been limited, in large part, by the
challenges associated with the translation of medical images into numerical models. The
workflow described here solves problems that constrain traditional computational modeling
approaches, mainly regarding time costs with segmentation and computationally limited file size.
Image semi-automated and manual segmentation approaches can be time consuming especially
when studying complex structures such as interwoven bird nests which have multiple parts that
require a subjective segmentation assessment of where each region of interest starts and ends.
Moreover, this algorithm, which is designed in a pipeline pattern where in each step and sub-step
the intermediate result is written to a textural file and read back before the following step, allows
an easy management of the complex and computationally intensive process. The translation of
image files into a textual format allows access to the data in a reasonable amount of time, and
lowers the complexity of both in/out operations and memory consumption.

Here, we describe a dedicated generic algorithm that successfully dissects and
reconstructs a multipart object, and directly translates it into a numerical model. The method
described and implemented herein points towards new modeling opportunities for which the
barriers between the physical and digital domains can be eliminated, enabling the digital
visualization, analysis and manipulation of complex, macro-scale biological structures, such as
bird nests. The resulting models closely resemble the physical analog, making this process
valuable for data analysis and computational biomechanics research. It is thus likely that
scientific modeling tools in the future will incorporate a method similar to the one described
herein, enabling scientists to access, digitally modify and analyze complex natural structures.
Furthermore, in the future, advanced capabilities to convert CT scans of biological structures into
digital data such as the one demonstrated herein may allow for sharing and exploration of diverse
biological structures in the scientific community10.

The proposed method consists of the following main steps: branch segmentation,
skeletonization, and branchpoint pruning and matching. Each of these steps is described
separately in the following subsections. In general the framework developed is based on first
generating a digital model of the nest, and the separating between its component. The analysis
results in a file listing the branch coordinates, their length, median thickness and contact points.

achieved using a sharp convolution kernel filter (V90μ) during the scans. X-ray projections were
set to an in-plane resolution of 0.5mm and slice-to-slice separation of 0.1mm.

Branch segmentation. The branch segmentation takes advantage of the relatively high
contrast in CT images between the nest branches and surrounding air. A 3D Gaussian Blur filter
is applied on each image slice to reduce image noise. Two new datasets are generated by setting
different thresholding parameters, this is realised by setting an upper limit of allowed difference
in voxel grey value. Next, a hole filling operation is applied for filling branches with inner
tunnels and refining inner branch regions that may have small holes due to noise. It is crucial to
eliminate inner branch cavities to ensure that the coming thinning process would not fail to
describe the actual geometric structure. After branch segmentation two new binary sub-volumes
are formed that represent the extracted nest; one that will yield the structure skeleton and another
for the defining of branches volumetric data.

Skeletonization. A binary nest formed in the previous step is skeletonized to identify the
three dimensional centreline of the structure and to determine the branchpoint locations.
Branches in the nest are interwoven and exhibit similar image characteristics which makes the
nest appear as a single part. Hence, this process is key for defining and separation each branch
entity. To obtain the skeleton, a sequential 3D thinning algorithm implemented in Fiji is used. A
thinning function deletes border voxels that can be removed without changing the topology of
the nest. The thinning is performed symmetrically and the resulting skeleton is guaranteed to lie
in the middle of the cylindrically shaped branch segments.

Branchpoint pruning and matching. After completion of the thinning step, the skeleton
is smoothed by pruning false branches, and locations of the branchpoints are identified and
pruned, resulting in simple edges without forks. The goal of branchpoint matching is to find
topological correspondence between edges that originate from the same branch. A generalisation
of different separation scenarios lies on the relative orientation of the branches and correlation
between them. Therefore, various separation and connection scenarios were considered for the
development of the algorithm, where edges are considered correlated based on the orientation,
distances, and branch thickness of endpoints. Correlated edges are connected and branch
parameters are calculated.

Figure 1. CT image data processing workflow and representative nests. (A) Dead-Sea
Sparrow (Passer moabiticus) representative nests. (B) Schematic overview of the modeling
algorithm. The algorithm first operates on the original CT scans of the studied nest, to
standardize and normalize the input. The first stage yields two image types, raw skeleton and
binary datasets. A dedicated algorithm is applied to the skeleton 3D model eliminating all
junction points between edges, then reconnecting highly correlated edges that originate from the
same branch. Superpositioning the binary data set and skeleton is used to calculate branch
thickness, length and contact points. Construction patterns of nests can then be investigated (C)
CT image dataset is generated, showing a voxel intersecting a layer (D). (E) Layers are
processed in parallel in Fiji, (F) Showing image processing of grayscale layers; grayscale after
neighbourhood averaging 3D filter in the z axis (�=5), 3D gaussian blur filter (�=1), and global
thresholding with a value cut off of 28. Next, a hole filling operation is applied and dataset is
skeletonized to identify the three dimensional centreline of the nest structure. (G) A second
dataset is processed using a gaussian blur filter (�=2) and a global thresholding cut off value of
24.

Figure 2

Figure 2. Digitizing an avian nest structure. Illustration example of the process of breaking the
skeleton structure and reconnecting highly correlated edges. (A) Structure skeleton with branches
represented as edges with different colors (n=9), including 4 junction vertices and 6 end vertice.
(B) Breaking the structure by eliminating junction points (black arrowheads), the resulting
structure is composed of end-end edges (n=9). (C) Edge groups with high inter-correlation are
marked with the same color, with correlated edges linked to each other through the high
correlation endpoint couples. (D) Short edges representing the contact points are eliminated. (E)
Illustration showing the different parameters used to measure the correlation between end-points
of two branches. Two end-points noted by p1 and p2, The direction of the branch at each end
point is measured as a vector from the end point to a point along the branch in a constant length
T measure along the branches skeleton. The two direction vectors are noted by v1 and v2
respectively. The angle between the two direction vectors is noted by A. A measurement of the
distance between each direction vector and the end point on the other branch is used, the two
distances are noted by d1 and d2 corresponding to p1 and p2. Measurement of the angle between
each direction vector and the vector formed by the two points, noted by a1 and a2. Thickness of
each branch at the corresponding end point is noted by t1 and t2 respectively. The thickness is
measured as the median taken over a fixed number of sample points on the branch's edge. The
distance between p1 and p2 is noted by D. (F) 3D model of reconstructed nest.

Figure 4. Nest intersection points and construction patterns. (A) Skeleton proportional to
original thickness (25% of original thickness) showing intersection points as spheres. Color and
radius of spheres is proportional to the thickness of branches intersecting. (B) Graph represents
the cumulative nest mass per step, comparing the two construction strategies. Where in each step
an estimated mass of the newly inserted twig is added. (C-D) Series of three-dimensional nest
models showing two building algorithms to test alternatives for building avian structures. (C)
GREEDY algorithm first identifies the structures scaffold (green), then each branch in turn is
added, when in each step the branch that is most gravity-connected is added to the existing
structure. (D) GRADUAL algorithm first builds a minimum viable skeleton that can hold the
structure, that is further enriched with branches.
