Abstract

24

Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the major pathogenic microorganism causing

25

enzootic pneumonia in pigs. With increasing resistance of M. hyopneumoniae to

26

conventional antibiotics, treatment is becoming complicated. Herein, we investigated

27

the mutant selection window (MSW) of doxycycline, tylosin, danofloxacin, tiamulin,

28

and valnemulin for treating M. hyopneumoniae strain (ATCC 25934) to determine the

29

likelihood of promoting resistance with continued use of these antibiotics. Minimum

30

inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against M. hyopneumoniae were determined for

31

each antimicrobial agent and ranged from 105 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL to 109

32

CFU/mL based on microdilution broth and agar dilution methods. The minimal

33

concentration inhibiting colony formation by 99% (MIC99) and the mutant prevention

34

concentration (MPC) were determined by the agar dilution method with three

35

inoculum sizes. Antimicrobial killing was determined based on MIC99 and MPC

36

values for all five agents. MIC values ranged from 0.001 to 0.25 μg/mL based on the

37

microdilution broth method, and from 0.008 to 1.0 μg/mL based on the agar dilution

38

method. MPC values ranged from 0.0016 to 10.24 μg/mL. MPC/MIC99 values were

39

ordered

40

achieved better bactericidal action than MIC99. Based on pharmacodynamic analyses,

41

danofloxacin, tylosin, and doxycycline are more likely to select resistant mutants than

42

tiamulin and valnemulin.

1. Introduction

47

Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the primary pathogen causing enzootic

48

pneumonia, an important chronic respiratory disease in pigs resulting in high

49

morbidity, low feed conversion rate, and considerable economic losses in the

50

swine breeding industry [1]. Additionally, the disease makes pigs more susceptible to

51

infection by secondary bacterial pathogens such as Pasteurella multocida and

52

Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae [2]. There are several kinds of antimicrobial agents

53

that exhibit in vitro activity against M. hyopneumoniae, such as pleuromutilins,

54

fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and tetracyclines [3, 4]. However, widespread use of

55

these agents has resulted in acquired resistance of M. hyopneumoniae to

56

fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, and macrolides [5-7]. Thus, in order to reduce the

57

risk of drug resistance, it is necessary to develop novel drugs. However, even if new

58

drugs are discovered, re-evaluation of antimicrobial dosing is essential, and is the

59

main method aimed at preventing the emergence and expansion of drug-resistant

60

strains.

61
62

The mutant selection window (MSW) hypothesis postulates that, for each

63

antimicrobial-pathogen combination, an antimicrobial concentration range exists in

64

which selective amplification of single-step, drug-resistant mutants occurs [8]. The

65

upper and lower boundaries of the MSW are the mutant prevention concentration

66

(MPC) and the minimal concentration that inhibits colony formation by 99% (MIC99),

67

respectively. The MPC is the minimum concentration that inhibits colony formation

68

of the least antibacterial drug-susceptible mutant subpopulation. Therefore, when

69

antimicrobial concentrations fall within the range of the MSW, this tends to lead to

70

the enrichment of drug-resistant bacteria. Keeping drug concentrations above the

71

MPC is likely to restrict the emergence of resistance [9]. This hypothesis has been

72

verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments [10-13].

73
74

Because M. hyopneumoniae lacks a cell wall and is small bacterium (0.4 – 1.2

75

μm), culture isolation conditions in vitro are a technical challenge. In particular,

76

quantification by the viable count method to determine colony-forming units (CFU) is

77

arduous. Therefore, studies on the pharmacodynamics of M. hyopneumoniae are

78

scarce. In the current study we determined for the first time the MPC and identified

79

the MSW for doxycycline, tylosin, danofloxacin, tiamulin and valnemulin against M.

80

hyopneumoniae in vitro. We also used time-kill tests to determine the relative

81

antibacterial effects at the MIC99 and the MPC. MSW and MPC are useful parameters

82

for optimizing dosing regimens, reducing the emergence of resistant mutants, and

83

analyzing treatment failure [14]. In addition, using the CFU counting method, changes

84

in the amount of M. hyopneumoniae after antibiotic action can be determined.

85

2. Materials and Methods

87

Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae standard strain ATCC 25934 was obtained as a

88

freeze-dried powder from the China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control (Beijing,

China) and stored at -80C. Broth medium base, cysteine, and NADH were purchased

90

from Qingdao Hope Biological Technology. Sterile swine serum was bought from

91

Guangzhou Ruite Biological Technology. The initial pH of the medium was 7.7 ± 0.1,

92

and 1% agar was added to solid media.

93

Doxycycline (85.8%), danofloxacin (100%), tiamulin (99%), tylosin (82.6%),

94

and valnemulin (98.3%) were obtained from Guangdong Dahuanong Animal Health

95

Products. These five antibacterial agents were dissolved in Milli-Q water and

96

sterilized by filtration. A 1280 μg/mL fresh stock solution of each antibacterial agent

97

was prepared for each experiment.

98
99

2.1 Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)

100

MIC values were determined as described previously [15]. Briefly, MIC values

101

were calculated for 105, 106, and 107 CFU/mL M. hyopneumoniae cultures in the

102

exponential phase. A 100 μL sample of exponential phase culture was added to an

103

equal volume of drug-containing medium culture in a 96-well plate. A growth control

104

(inoculum without antimicrobials), sterility control (sterile broth at pH 7.8), and

105

end-point control (blank medium at pH 6.8) were included. Plates were cultured at

106

37C with 5% CO2 in an incubator after being sealed. When the color of the growth

107

control was the same as the end-point control, the MIC was determined as the

108

minimal concentration of antibacterial agent that resulted in no color change.

109
110

MIC values were determined by the agar dilution method as described previously

111

[16]. A 10 μL sample of M. hyopneumoniae culture (105107 CFU) was placed on the

112

surface of a plate in which wells contained 1.2520 μg/mL danofloxacin, 232 μg/mL

113

tiamulin, 464 μg/mL tylosin, 580 μg/mL doxycycline, or 0.162.56 μg/mL for

114

two-fold agar dilution analysis. All plates were incubated for at least 8 days.

115

Meanwhile, growth control plates without antimicrobials were set up for each test,

116

and all experiments were repeated three times. The lowest concentration without M.

117

hyopneumoniae growth on agar plates was taken as the MIC value. Each test was

118

repeated three times.

119
120

2.2 Measurement of MIC99 and mutant prevention concentration (MPC)

121

MIC99 values were measured as reported previously [17] with modifications.

122

MIC99 drug concentrations were based on linear decreasing dilutions of MIC values.

123

The antibiotic concentration ranged from 1 × MIC to 0.5 × MIC in sequential 10%

124

dilution decreases. The quantity of bacteria in the logarithmic growth phase reached

125

107 CFU/mL. Three 10 μL drops of each diluted suspension were inoculated onto agar

126

plates and cultured for at least 8 days as described above. Colony numbers between

127

30 and 300 were counted.

128
129

The MPC is defined as the lowest drug concentration that prevents bacterial

130

colony formation from a culture containing ≥109 CFU/mL bacteria [18]. We

131

attempted different centrifugal methods for enriching M. hyopneumoniae. Ultimately,

132

an 800 mL stationary growth phase culture was transferred into 20 tubes (each 50 mL),

133

tubes were centrifuged (5000 × g for 20 min), and each bacteria solution was

134

resuspended in 1 mL fresh medium. All 20 enriched cultures were combined into two

135

15 mL tubes, centrifuged (5000 × g for 20 min), and resuspended in 1 mL fresh

136

medium for counting. The final concentration of M. hyopneumoniae was 8.8×109

137

CFU/mL.

138
139

MPC values were measured by the agar method as described previously [19].

140

Briefly, 200 μL samples of each enriched culture were inoculated onto agar plates

141

containing various concentrations of antibiotic (six parallel solid plates per antibiotic

142

concentration). These plates were incubated at 37C with 5% CO2 in a humidified

143

incubator for 810 days. The lowest antibiotic concentration that resulted in no

144

colony formation was considered the primary MPC (MPCpr). After a 20% linear drug

145

concentration decrease in MPCpr, the MPC was tested again, and recorded as the

146

lowest drug concentration preventing bacterial growth. Each test was repeated three

147

times.

148
149

2.3 Time-kill tests

150

In vitro time-killing assays were performed as described previously [20]. Briefly,

151

MIC99 and MPC values for all five agents were tested. After adding 3.5 mL blank

152

medium and 0.1 mL drug solution (40 times the target concentration) to each

153

penicillin bottle, 0.4 mL exponential M. hyopneumoniae suspension with an inoculum

154

size between 105 CFU/mL and 109 CFU/mL was added. Cultures were incubated at

155

37C with 5% CO2 for 48 h. Aliquots of 100 μL were collected from each culture at 0,

156

3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. The viable cell number was determined via 10-fold serial

157

dilutions and plating 10 μL of each diluted culture on drug-free agar. Growth controls

158

(M. hyopneumoniae cultures without drugs) and sterility controls (5 mL medium at

159

pH 7.8) were also included. Plates were incubated for at least 8 days at 37C with 5%

160

CO2 in a humidified incubator. Each test was repeated three times.

3. Results

163

3.1 MIC determination

164

MICs of danofloxacin, tiamulin, tylosin, doxycycline, and valnemulin against M.

165

hyopneumoniae determined by the microdilution and agar dilution methods are shown

166

in Figure 1. Values determined using the solid MIC method were 8-fold higher

167

(tylosin), 4-fold higher (danofloxacin, doxycycline, and valnemulin), and 2-fold

168

higher (tiamulin) than those determined by the liquid method at an identical inoculum

169

size of 105 CFU/mL. In addition, as the inoculum size used in these assays was

170

increased, the MIC values also increased. M. hyopneumoniae displayed its greatest

171

sensitivity to valnemulin and its least to doxycycline

172
173

3.2 Determination of MIC99, MPC, and selection index (SI)

174

MIC99, MPC, and SI values are shown in Table 1. The SI, the ratio of MPC to

175

MIC99, reflects the ability of an antibacterial agent to induce resistant mutants. MIC99

176

values for all antibacterial agents ranged from 0.0122 to 0.343 μg/mL, and MPC

177

values ranged from 0.016 to 10.24 μg/mL. SI values ranged from 1.31 to 10.24, and

178

were ranked valnemulin <tiamulin <danofloxacin <doxycycline <tylosin (low to high).

179

Thus, valnemulin displayed the lowest SI value, while tylosin exhibited the highest SI

180

value.

181
182

3.3 In vitro killing analysis

183

Time-kill curves of compounds against M. hyopneumoniae were obtained using

184

three different inoculum sizes. Reductions in M. hyopneumoniae count with different

185

inoculum sizes for MIC99 and MPC are listed in Table 2 and Table 3. Danofloxacin,

186

tiamulin, tylosin, and valnemulin achieved bactericidal activity against 105 CFU/mL

187

M. hyopneumoniae with MIC99 dosage, while doxycycline achieved bacteriostatic

188

activity only. Colony count reductions recorded at the 48h time point 3.63, 3.68, 3.75,

189

and 3.61 log10 CFU/mL for danofloxacin, tiamulin, tylosin, and valnemulin,

190

respectively, but only 1.4 log10 CFU/mL for doxycycline. All five compounds

191

achieved bactericidal activity against 105 CFU/mL M. hyopneumoniae with MPC

192

dosage (Figure 2).

193

At a greater inoculum size (107 CFU/mL), danofloxacin, tiamulin, tylosin and

194

valnemulin were bactericidal at the MIC99 while doxycycline was bacteriostatic only.

195

Colony count reductions recorded at the 48h time point were 5.15 log10 CFU/mL for

196

danofloxacin, 5.09 log10 CFU/mL for valnemulin, 3.51 log10 CFU/mL for tiamulin,

197

4.13 log10 CFU/mL for tylosin, and 1.16 log10 CFU/mL for doxycycline. All five

198

compounds achieved bactericidal activity against 107 CFU/mL M. hyopneumoniae

199

with MPC dosage (Figure 3).

200

Danofloxacin and valnemulin both achieved bactericidal activity against 109

201

CFU/mL of M. hyopneumoniae cells at the MIC99 concentrations while the other three

202

were bacteriostatic only. Colony count reductions recorded at 48 h were danofloxacin

203

5.61 log10 CFU/mL, valnemulin 4.81 log10 CFU/mL, tiamulin 2.23 log10 CFU/mL,

204

tylosin 2.39 log10 CFU/mL and doxycycline 2.43 log10 CFU/mL. All compounds

205

achieved bactericidal activity against 109 CFU/mL of M. hyopneumoniae at the MPC

206

concentrations. Overall, the rank order of antibacterial agents for colony count

207

reduction was danofloxacin >valnemulin >tylosin >tiamulin >doxycycline (Figure 4).

4. Discussion

210

M. hyopneumoniae is a major respiratory disease-causing pathogen in modern

211

intensive pig farming worldwide. Although vaccine-based immunization is an

212

important preventive measure for enzootic pneumonia, treatment with antibacterial

213

agents is known to accelerate disease recovery and reduce disease-related

214

complications. However, strains resistant to enrofloxacin and tylosin have appeared

215

among clinically isolated strains [6, 7]. In particular, many fluoroquinolones are

216

important antibiotics for the treatment of human infections, and are more likely to

217

lead to cross-resistance. Due to the difficulties associated with in vitro culturing and

218

viability counting (CFU measurements) for M. hyopneumoniae, systematic in vitro

219

pharmacodynamic evaluation of antibacterial agents against M. hyopneumoniae is

220

scarce. Thus, in the present study, in vitro pharmacodynamic indices of several
10

221

representative antimicrobial agents against M. hyopneumoniae were determined, and

222

killing curves were plotted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to

223

explore the risk of M. hyopneumoniae resistance using MPC and MSW parameters.

224

MIC values determined by the liquid method were similar to those measured in

225

previous studies [4, 5]. Using both liquid and solid agar methods, MIC values

226

increased with increasing inoculum size; values obtained with a large inoculum were

227

two to four times higher than those obtained with small inoculum. It has been reported

228

previously that MIC values increase with increasing bacterial load [21, 22]. Among

229

the five antibiotics tested, danofloxacin and tylosin were more sensitive to inoculum

230

size for MIC determination. In an earlier report [23], a larger inoculum of

231

Staphylococcus aureus had a more significant effect on the antibacterial activity of

232

nafcillin and vancomycin than a smaller inoculum. Therefore, in cases of

233

high bacterial inoculation, more careful consideration is required when selecting the

234

MIC reference value for the relevant experiment. In clinical treatment, the MIC value

235

should be determined for different bacterial counts according to the severity of animal

236

infection to establish a better treatment plan.

237

The MPC is defined as the concentration of antibacterial drug that prevents the

238

growth of large quantities of resistant sub-populations. Because culturing of M.

239

hyopneumoniae is difficult in vitro, determination of MPC values is challenging; after

240

much effort, M. hyopneumoniae was cultured to a cell density of 107108 CFU/mL.

241

We tried a variety of enrichment methods to generate quantities of bacteria sufficient

242

for determining MPCs, and eventually managed to measure MPCs for all five

243

antibiotics. Relationships between antimicrobial exposure, MPC/MSW values and

244

antimicrobial resistance selection have been explored previously. For example, in

245

Staphylococcus

246

intermediate between the MIC99 and MPC, and above the MPC resulted in the

247

selection of mutants that differed in terms of the proportion of resistant and

248

susceptible bacteria [11]. When the concentration of levofloxacin fell within the

249

MSW, the sensitivity of S. aureus decreased and mutant subpopulations emerged [24].

250

For M. hyopneumoniae, the reported danofloxacin, tylosin, and doxycycline

251

concentrations in pigs fell within the MSW completely after an intramuscular dose of

252

2.5 or 10 mg/kg (body weight); after oral administration at a dose of 20 mg/kg, Cmax

253

values for danofloxacin, tylosin, and doxycycline were 0.45 ± 0.09, 2.71 ± 1.09, and

254

2.44 ± 0.51 μg/mL [25-27]. Correlative MIC99 and MPC values were 0.101 and 1.0,

255

0.34 and 10.24, and 0.343 and 4.0 μg/mL, respectively. The reported tiamulin and

256

valnemulin concentrations were comfortably above the MSW values only after oral

257

administration at a dose of 10 or 25 mg/kg [28, 29]. Consequently, by combining the

258

in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters and the in vitro pharmacodynamic results, we

259

speculate that danofloxacin, tylosin, and doxycycline are more likely to select

260

resistant mutants than tiamulin and valnemulin. Continued use of first-line

261

antibacterial agents against M. hyopneumoniae according to current dosing regimens

262

may therefore promote drug resistance selection, and hence limit their long-term

263

efficacy in the treatment of endemic pneumonia in pigs.

265

tiamulin, and valnemulin against M. hyopneumoniae at various bacterial densities and

266

drug

267

displayed bacteriostatic activity at MIC99 dosage and bactericidal action at MPC

268

dosage. At the highest inoculation amount, tiamulin and valnemulin acted

269

as bacteriostatic agents at MIC99 dosage and as bactericidal agents at MPC dosage.

270

Danofloxacin exhibited the fastest sterilization rate. Moreover, valnemulin was highly

271

sensitive to M. hyopneumoniae, and exerted an obvious bactericidal effect. These

272

results showed that when the concentration of antibiotic equaled or exceeded the MPC,

273

M. hyopneumoniae was rapidly killed. Drug concentrations at the MPC also reduced

274

the chances of bacteria re-growing during drug exposure. These results are similar to

275

those of an earlier report [30]. In this previous study, the bactericidal effect at MIC

276

was slow and incomplete. However, at MPC and maximum serum or tissue drug

277

concentrations, killing was more pronounced than at MIC, and increased with

The main limitation of the present study was that the in vitro pharmacodynamic

280

determination of M. hyopneumoniae was only carried for the standard strain, and

281

clinical isolates should be assessed to confirm our findings. Nevertheless, the present

282

work represents a meaningful pilot study in this area. A second limitation is that all

283

experiments were performed under ideal conditions in vitro, without considering the

284

complexity of factors in vivo. Thus, in vivo experiments are currently being explored.

285

In conclusion, the present study was the first to establish pharmacodynamic

286

analyses of five antimicrobial agents against M. hyopneumoniae. And we determined

MPC and MSW parameters to explore the risk of M. hyopneumoniae resistance. The

288

results showed that the bactericidal action of MPC was better than MIC99, and the

289

antibacterial effects of these drugs against M. hyopneumoniae are significantly

290

different. These pharmacodynamic results are meaningful in choosing antimicrobials

291

for therapy. And danofloxacin, tylosin, and doxycycline are more likely to select

292

resistant mutants than tiamulin and valnemulin.
