Summary:
Melanomas harboring ​BRAF mutations can be treated with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), but
responses are varied and tumor recurrence is inevitable. Here, using an integrative approach of
experimentation and mathematical flux balance analyses in ​BRAF​-mutated melanoma cells, we
report that elevated antioxidant capacity is linked to BRAFi sensitivity in melanoma cells. High
levels of antioxidant metabolites in cells with reduced BRAFi sensitivity confirm this conclusion.
By extending our analyses to other melanoma subtypes in TCGA, we predict that elevated
redox capacity is a general feature of melanomas, not previously observed. We propose that
redox vulnerabilities could be exploited for therapeutic benefits and identify unsuspected
combination targets to enhance the effects of BRAFi in any melanoma, regardless of mutational
status.

Introduction:
Targeted therapy has been a major breakthrough for melanoma patients harboring ​BRAFV600
​
mutations because of a superior response rate, and a remarkable short-term efficacy ​(Chapman
et al., 2011; Sosman et al., 2012)​. However, the clinical responses are highly variable and
short-lived, and relapse is almost universal ​(Shi et al., 2014; Sosman et al., 2012)​. Overcoming
reduced sensitivity and acquired resistance to targeted therapy is a major goal of current
melanoma research. Several mechanisms of reduced sensitivity have been proposed

(Poulikakos et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2014; Wagle et al., 2011)​, which
have led to the development of several combination regimens in melanoma either with other
targeted therapies ​(Flaherty et al., 2012; Larkin et al., 2014; Menzies and Long, 2014)​, or in
conjunction with immunotherapies ​(Hu-Lieskovan et al., 2015)​. While these therapies improve
responses, treatment outcomes still vary, and benefits remain transient and unpredictable ​(Luke
et al., 2017)​.
Some resistance can be attributed to genetic mutations ​(Greaves and Maley, 2012; Nowell,
1976)​, but accumulating evidence indicates that nongenetic processes play a critical role in
response of cancer cells to drug treatment ​(Niepel et al., 2009; Paudel et al., 2018; Shaffer et
al., 2017; Smith et al., 2016)​. Metabolic reprogramming, recognized as a hallmark of cancer,
has recently emerged as a potential nongenetic process that contributes to the emergence of
drug-tolerant cancer cells ​(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011)​. Otto Warburg first reported a link
between tumor and metabolism in his influential observation that cancer cells convert most
intracellular glucose to lactate--that is aerobic glycolysis ​(Warburg, 1925)​. Recent studies have
shown that cancer cells can utilize glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, or both, depending on
their environment ​(Dang, 2012)​. Furthermore, cancer cells can adapt metabolically in response
to external perturbations ​(DeBerardinis et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2019)​. This metabolic flexibility
provides cancer cells with energy, and necessary intermediates for biosynthetic processes
required for survival and to maintain redox balance under changing environments ​(DeBerardinis
et al., 2008; Paudel and Quaranta, 2019)​. Furthermore, metabolic pathways are complex and
interconnected, warranting a systems level approach to examine their relative importance, and
how they change in cancer cells. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is the most commonly used
mathematical modeling approach for genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions to
estimate the role of metabolic reactions in a network ​(Blazier and Papin, 2012; Orth et al.,
2010)​. Such a quantitative approach can be utilized to predict global metabolic states of cancer
cells under various conditions.
Melanoma cells upon BRAF-inhibition have been shown to induce an enhanced oxidative
phosphorylation ​(Delgado-Goni et al., 2016; Haq et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2016)​. Byproducts of
augmented mitochondrial activity are reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this metabolic switch
promotes oxidative stress in cells ​(Cesi et al., 2017; Zorov et al., 2014)​. However, the cellular
response to ROS is rather complex: low levels facilitate intracellular signaling, while high levels
may cause cell death ​(Dikalov et al., 2011; Panieri and Santoro, 2016; Schieber and Chandel,
2014)​. Therefore, cells require a robust antioxidant defense system to respond to an
accumulation of ROS. By invoking antioxidant systems, cancer cells can clear excess ROS
levels within a range that is not detrimental to them--a high redox homeostatic state ​(DeNicola
et al., 2011)​. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and glutathione (GSH)
are two major antioxidants that maintain redox homeostasis in cells ​(Panieri and Santoro, 2016)​.
NADPH is produced via the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), and acts as a shared substrate
for both GSH regeneration, and ROS production, thus maintaining an optimum redox balance
within cancer cells. Even within cancer subtypes, this redox state could be heterogeneous

(Sarmiento-Salinas et al., 2019)​, motivating further research to examine how this balance could
be altered for therapeutic benefits.
The link between oxidative stress and drug response in melanoma is beginning to be explored
(Mishra et al., 2018; Zaal and Berkers, 2018)​. BRAF-inhibitor resistant melanomas were shown
to upregulate ​NRF2​-mediated antioxidant response to maintain cell survival ​(Khamari et al.,
2018)​. Nonetheless, it still remains to be examined how redox potential of melanoma cells
affects their drug sensitivity, and how it is maintained under BRAF-inhibition. These are
important considerations, raising the possibility that redox balance can be modulated to
enhance the effects of existing therapies ​(Yuan et al., 2018)​.
Here, we show that antioxidant capacity of melanoma cells is linked to their drug sensitivity.
Using an integrative approach through bioinformatics and FBA, we show that melanoma cells
with reduced sensitivity to BRAFi exhibit an enhanced capacity for anti-oxidation and redox
buffer, specifically through NADPH oxidizing enzymes. By directly quantifying the redox-related
metabolites, we confirm that drug-insensitive melanoma cells can maintain higher levels of
antioxidant metabolites during treatment. Furthermore, we report that pharmacological
disruption of redox axis involving glutathione enhances the effects of targeted therapies. We
also extended our analysis to other melanoma subtypes in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),
and found that elevated redox capacity could be a general feature of melanoma. Our results
thus provide a proof-of-principle that redox vulnerabilities could be exploited for therapeutic
benefits in melanoma.
Results:
Gene expressions and Flux Balance Analyses reveal enhanced capacity of redox balance
in cells with reduced sensitivity to BRAF-inhibition
We recently reported that ​BRAF-​ mutated melanoma cell lines, including isogenic single-cell
derived subclones, exhibit varying drug sensitivities to a small molecule ​BRAF ​kinase inhibitor
(BRAFi) ​(Hardeman et al., 2017; Paudel et al., 2018)​. Using Drug-Induced Proliferation (DIP)
rates (​Table S1​) ​(Harris et al., 2016)​, as a measure of drug effects, we examined the molecular
correlates of ​BRAF​i sensitivity, and reported that top 200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
in drug-insensitive cells were enriched in processes and functions related to redox metabolism
(Meyer et al., 2019)​. Here, we extended our analysis to examine all significant DEGs among
isogenic subclones (​Table S2​) using their RNASeq profiles. Among 2,165 DEGs, 1361 (⅔) were
up-regulated, while 804 (⅓) were down-regulated (​Fig. 1A, B)​ . Next, we projected all DEGs
onto a larger panel of ​BRAF-​ mutated melanoma cells from CCLE datasets ​(Barretina et al.,
2012)​, and calculated their correlation to DIP rates. We selected significantly correlated genes
using a criterion as outlined in ​Fig. 1A,​ and identified both positively and negatively correlated
genes (​Fig. 1C & Table S3​). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on positively correlated genes in
both subclones (​Fig. 1B​), and CCLE melanoma panel (​Fig. 1C​) showed enrichment of
molecular functions related to redox balance, coenzyme metabolic process, and oxidoreductase

activity (​Fig. 1D & Table S4​). Specifically, we observed enrichment of gene signatures (CYBA,
NADPH Oxidase 5 (NOX5), HTATIP2, SLC7A11, highlighted in magenta in ​Fig. 1B & C​) related
to redox balance and modulation, oxidoreductase activity, and reactions that utilize or consume
antioxidant NADPH as a substrate (​Fig. 1E)​ . To quantify the contribution of redox ​enzymes
toward NADPH oxidation, we next predicted steady-state fluxes through several major
NADPH-oxidizing ​reactions using a previously published framework for integrating
transcriptomic, kinetic, and thermodynamic data into Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) models of
individual cancer cell lines ​(Lewis et al., 2018; Orth et al., 2010)​. The drug-insensitive SC10
model showed significantly greater total conversion of NADPH to NADP+ compared to the
drug-sensitive SC01 model. ​While most reactions did not display significant differences in
predicted flux distributions, the SC10 model had significantly higher fluxes through Glutathione
Disulfide Reductase (GSR), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and NADPH oxidase
(NOX1/3/5/CYBB) (​Fig. 1F & Table S5A​). Consistent with the results in isogenic subclones, the
subset of CCLE melanoma cell lines which are insensitive to MAPK-pathway inhibition also had
higher predicted fluxes through GSR and DHFR reactions (​Fig. 1G & Table S5B)​ . Taken
together, these results suggest that melanoma cells with reduced drug sensitivity, as measured
by DIP rates, exhibit enhanced anti-oxidation and redox balance. Specifically, we found that
NADPH oxidation reactions coupled to glutathione exhibited higher gene expression and
predicted fluxes in drug-insensitive melanoma cells.

Redox metabolites with antioxidant properties are maintained at higher levels after
BRAF-inhibition in melanoma cells with reduced sensitivity to BRAF-inhibition
To directly assess the metabolite abundance, we performed a combined global
untargeted-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics
analysis in ​BRAF​-mutated melanoma cells under ​BRAF​-inhibition. In particular, we selected one

drug-sensitive (WM88), and one drug-insensitive (SC10) melanoma cell line, and compared
their metabolite profiles both in the absence and presence of ​BRAF​-inhibitors (​Table S6)​ . In
total, 2687 features or metabolites (unique retention time and m/z pairs) were detected,
quantified and analyzed in these studies. Unsupervised Principal Component Analysis across all
detected metabolites clustered sensitive melanoma cells away from insensitive cells at baseline
along principal component 1 (PC1), while the drug-treated samples are separated along
principal component 2 (PC2) (​Fig. 2A​). In general, the cells exhibit distinct metabolite profiles,
with BRAF-inhibition inducing a marked metabolite profile shift (​Fig. 2A, B​). In these studies, 18
validated (Level 1) redox metabolites were quantified. These metabolites were validated through
accurate mass measurements (<5 ppm error), similarities in isotope distribution (>90%),
matched retention times, and matched fragmentation spectra based on in-house databases
(Schrimpe-Rutledge et al., 2016)​. In sum, we observed 2687 metabolites and using the
combined global metabolomic profiles were able to mine the data for high confident metabolite
identification for molecules of interest (redox, GSH synthesis and energy metabolites).
To probe the treatment-dependent changes in metabolite abundances, we also performed
pairwise comparisons between BRAFi treated and control samples within each cell line. In
particular, we focused on the redox-related metabolites based on our earlier results on
anti-oxidation and redox balance. Differentially expressed metabolites were determined based
on a statistical cutoff of FDR-adjusted p-values < 0.001, and log-fold change greater or equal to
1. PLX4720 treatment significantly depleted the levels of energy metabolites such as GTP, UTP,
ATP, GDP in both cell lines (​Fig. 2C, Fig. S1A)​ . Among the redox metabolites, there was an
increase in monophosphate nucleotides such as UMP, AMP in SC10 (​Fig. 2C​). Interestingly,
reduced GSH levels were significantly depleted only in WM88, and not in SC10 upon BRAFi
treatment (​Fig. 2C​). GSH levels, however, were comparable between two cells at baseline (​Fig.
2D, Fig. S1B)​ . Because glutathione can exist in both reduced (GSH), and oxidized form
(GSSG), we also quantified the levels of GSSG in both WM88 and SC10 cells. GSSG levels
were lower in SC10 compared to WM88 at baseline, but similar in PLX4720 treatment (​Fig. 2D)​ .
The ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione, often used as an indicator of oxidative stress in
cells, were also calculated. These data show that SC10 cells had a significantly higher
GSH:GSSG ratio at baseline compared to drug-sensitive WM88 cells, rendering them a robust
antioxidant capacity (​Fig. 2D​). Upon treatment, SC10 showed a slight decrease in GSH:GSSG
ratio (μ_DMSO = 1.20, μ_PLX = 0.732, decrease of 1.6 fold). In contrast, WM88 showed an
approximately 10-fold decrease in its ratio upon BRAF-inhibition (μ_DMSO = 0.67, μ_PLX =
0.067) (​Fig. S1C​).
Additionally, we also quantified the abundance of cysteine, cystine, and Serine--all precursors of
de novo GSH synthesis. Transport of cystine into cells to form cysteine depends on the activity
of cystine/glutamate antiporter, SLC7A11, one of the genes positively correlated with DIP rates.
At baseline, we did not detect cystine, therefore, we quantified the ratio of cystine and cysteine
in drug-treated conditions. The ratio of cystine and cysteine under treatment was significantly
higher in WM88 than in SC10, indicating a rapid accumulation of extracellular cystine (​Fig.
S1D)​ . Additionally, BRAFi treatment significantly increased the levels of Cysteine in SC10, and

not in WM88 (​Fig. 2C​). Levels of serine were substantially higher in SC10 compared to WM88
at baseline, and upon BRAFi treatment were maintained in SC10, and significantly decreased in
WM88 (​Fig. 2C, Fig. S1A, S1E)​ . Collectively, these results indicate that drug-insensitive cells
have a robust anti-oxidation and redox system that can be maintained under BRAF-inhibition,
perhaps through both an efficient regeneration and ​de novo​ synthesis of GSH.

Based on our results involving antioxidants NADPH (​Fig. 1​), and GSH (​Fig. 2​), we carefully
constructed a schematic of reactions and identified the known inhibitors of the redox
components (​Fig. 3A​). Because our data suggest a positive correlation between enhanced
anti-oxidation balance in melanoma cells and reduced drug sensitivity, we examined whether
we could alter sensitivity of melanoma cells to BRAFi by using redox inhibitors. To evaluate the
role of different redox components, we tested BRAF-inhibitors in combination with known redox
inhibitors such as DPI, RSL3, Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), Erastin, and FK866. We subjected
two cell lines, one sensitive (WM88), and one insensitive (SC10) to increasing concentrations of
either DPI, RSL3, or BSO alone or in combination with 8μM PLX4720 (​Fig. 3B​). While both cells
exhibited concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effects to single redox inhibitors (DPI,
RSL3, BSO), enhanced effects of combination were observed only in the insensitive, and not in
cells already sensitive to PLX4720 (​Fig. 3B​). Similar effects were seen in A2058, considered as
largely insensitive ​BRAF​-mutated melanoma cells (​Fig. S2)​ . Depending on the drugs, the
combination either increased efficacy (maximum effect), or potency (more effect with less drug)
or both in drug-insensitive SC10. However, not all redox inhibitors enhanced the effects of
PLX4720. Erastin (SLC7A11 inhibitor) alone did not exhibit any effects on SC10, and its
combination with PLX4720 was similar to the effects of PLX4720 alone (​Fig. 3C, ​black dotted
line). Similarly, the combination of FK866 (which inhibits the enzyme NAMPT, and thus depletes
NAD+) with PLX4720 was not advantageous compared to single agents alone. At lower
concentrations, the effect of combination was similar to PLX4720 alone, and at higher
concentrations, similar to FK866 alone, indicating that the combination did not enhance the
effects of single agents (​Fig. 3C)​ . This is an interesting result, as it suggests that inhibition of
only certain redox components may enhance the effects of BRAF-inhibitors in ​BRAF-​ mutated
melanoma cells.

Enhanced effects of combination are due to increased oxidative stress
Our drug combinations suggest that co-administration of certain redox inhibitors with PLX4720
enhance the benefits of targeted therapies in melanoma (​Fig. 3)​ . To investigate how
co-administrations affect redox balance in melanoma cells, we stained ​BRAF​-mutated
melanoma cell, SKMEL5 treated with either single agents or combinations with ​CellROX® Deep
Red Reagent. Specifically, we tested three drug combinations that showed increased drug
effects with BRAF-inhibitors: DPI, RSL3, and BSO. Unlike in BSO, and RSL3, the total cellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were increased upon PLX4720 treatment (p < 0.001)
(​Fig. 4A & Fig. S3​), consistent with the results in earlier reports ​(Bauer et al., 2017)​. Although
counter-intuitive, DPI treatment as single agent induced a significant increase in ROS intensity
compared to DMSO control (​Fig. 4A & Fig. S3)​ . This result is consistent with studies that
suggest DPI is a non-specific NOX-inhibitor, and causes an enhanced oxidative stress in cells
(Riganti et al., 2004)​. DPI is a general flavoprotein inhibitor, and non-specific NOX-inhibitors; it
is also shown to inhibit xanthine oxidase, eNOS etc ​(Altenhöfer et al., 2015)​. Similarly, all three
drug combinations (BSO+PLX, RSL3+PLX, & DPI+PLX) resulted in a significant increase in
total cellular ROS compared to DMSO control, PLX4720 alone or the respective single agents
(​Fig. 4A & Fig. S3​). Our results reveal that co-administration of redox inhibitors with PLX4720
disrupts redox balance in cells, and causes an increase in oxidative stress. Therefore, we

sought to test whether the lethal effects of these drug combinations could be mitigated by
exogenous antioxidants. We excluded the combination of DPI and PLX4720, because of the
broad off-target effects of DPI. For the other two combinations, we co-treated melanoma cells
with two known antioxidants: reduced Glutathione (GSH), and lipophilic antioxidant Ferrostatin-1
(FER). The effects of PLX4720 alone could not be rescued by either GSH, and FER (​Fig. S4)​ ,
indicating that the antiproliferative effects of PLX4720 is not due to oxidative stress alone.
Interestingly, supplementation of the culture medium with GSH substantially rescued both
RSL3, and BSO-induced cell death in combination (​Fig. 4C)​ , while Ferrostain-1 rescue was
specific to RSL3 only, confirming the glutathione levels as a mechanistic link for reduced drug
sensitivity in ​BRAF-​ mutated melanoma cells.

Pan-melanoma metabolic models exhibit altered redox metabolism and enhanced
antioxidative capacity
While melanomas with reduced sensitivity to BRAF-inhibition show enhanced antioxidative
capacity potentiating redox-targeting therapies, it remains unclear whether other melanoma
subtypes display similar or varying redox phenotypes. To investigate whether alterations in
redox metabolism are common attributes across melanomas, FBA models of 103 melanoma
tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 860 normal skin tissues from the

Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project were developed using their respective gene
expression profiles ​(Carithers and Moore, 2015; Lewis et al., 2018; Weinstein et al., 2013)​.
Melanoma tumor models displayed greater steady-state fluxes through major NADPH-oxidizing
reactions including GSR and DHFR compared to normal tissue models (​Fig. 5A​). Interestingly,
normal tissue models predicted significantly greater flux through DUOX1/2, an NADPH-oxidizing
enzyme involved in cellular ROS generation; thus, increased activity of antioxidant-generating
GSR and decreased activity of ROS-generating DUOX1/2 likely contribute to the enhanced
antioxidative capacity in melanoma tumors compared to normal tissues ​(Donkó et al., 2005)​.
These findings are similar to the comparison in predicted metabolic fluxes between
drug-insensitive SC10 cells and drug-sensitive SC01 cells (​Fig. 1F​), suggesting a possible
progression in redox capacity from normal skin tissues (low capacity) to drug-sensitive
melanomas (medium capacity) to drug-insensitive melanomas (high capacity). Using our FBA
models of TCGA tumors, a simulated metabolome-wide gene knockout screen was performed,
where for each of the 3,268 genes in the Recon3D metabolic reconstruction, the effect of gene
knockout on total NADPH oxidation in each melanoma model was determined (​Fig. 5B​) ​(Brunk
et al., 2018)​. Many of the gene knockouts with greatest effects on NADPH oxidation across
TCGA melanoma models included major genes involved in the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH
(e.g. GLUD1, GLUD2, IDH2, MTHFD1), as well as genes utilizing reduced NADPH to increase
cellular antioxidant stores or decrease levels of reactive oxygen species (e.g. GSR, CBR1)
(Hayes and Dinkova-Kostova, 2014; Lewis et al., 2018)​. Next, we sought to test whether our
identified redox-targeting therapies work in other subtypes of melanoma. We applied the drug
combinations (BSO+PLX, and RSL3+PLX) in ​NRAS-​ mutated (SKMEL2), and ​NF1​-mutated
(MeWo) melanoma cells. The combinations increased efficacy of BRAF-inhibitors in both
SKMEL2, and MeWo cells, consistent with results above (​Fig. 5C)​ . Collectively, these findings
suggest that altered redox metabolism and enhanced antioxidant production are common
features among melanomas, and that inhibition of redox enzymes may be a viable treatment
strategy for melanomas in general.

Discussion:
Overall, we report here that higher antioxidant ability of cells correlates to lower drug sensitivity
to targeted therapies in melanoma. Our analyses reveal an association between an elevated
redox capacity, involving two reducing cofactors NADPH and GSH, and reduced drug sensitivity
in melanoma. Furthermore, we show that drug-insensitive melanoma cells not only possess a
robust redox system, but also maintain key antioxidant metabolites during treatment. Indeed, we
show that the disruption of this redox buffer improves the outcomes of targeted therapies. In
summary, our findings suggest that modulation of cancer antioxidant defense could be exploited
to augment the benefits of existing therapies in melanoma ​(Khamari et al., 2018; Yuan et al.,
2018)​. This strategy may extend beyond melanoma, as antioxidant pathways have been

implicated in tumor progression, and drug resistance ​(Harris et al., 2015; Ji et al., 2018;
Sarmiento-Salinas et al., 2019)​.
How ROS affects cancer cells has been a contentious issue for years. ROS likely elicits a broad
spectrum of cellular responses ​(Paudel and Quaranta, 2019)​. Although still debated, its effects
on cancer cells can best be described as hormesis ​(Schieber and Chandel, 2014)​: at low
levels, it can mediate sustained network signaling leading to enhanced proliferation ​(Sena and
Chandel, 2012)​, while at high levels, it can induce cellular damage and cell death ​(Panieri and
Santoro, 2016; Ray et al., 2012)​. The level of ROS that a cell can handle, thus, likely depends
on how functional its antioxidant machinery is. In general, tumors can sustain a much higher
levels of ROS compared to normal tissues by invoking their antioxidant systems, thereby
creating a high redox homeostatic state ​(DeNicola et al., 2011)​. Melanoma tumors could
possibly exist in such a high redox homeostatic state, as we see an increased activity of
antioxidant-generating GSR, and decreased activity of ROS-generating DUOX1/2 in TCGA
melanoma tumors compared to normal skin. However, there exists a significant variability even
within tumors, captured well in melanoma cell lines, suggesting redox capacity perhaps could be
on a continuum: low capacity (normal skin), moderate capacity (drug-sensitive melanomas), and
high capacity (drug-insensitive melanomas).
Based on modeling by Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), the high redox capacity in drug-insensitive
melanomas is predicted to stem from elevated fluxes through metabolic reactions which
generate important antioxidant molecules including glutathione. This computational approach
towards predicting genome-scale metabolic phenotypes has many advantages. By integrating
the most comprehensive model of human metabolism to date with transcriptomic data from cell
lines or tumors of interest, quantitative predictions on the metabolic status of these samples can
be obtained, which would not be available from gene expression analysis alone ​(Blazier and
Papin, 2012; Brunk et al., 2018; Lewis et al., 2018)​. Additionally, although FBA models can only
make steady-state flux predictions, the interconnections between 13,000+ metabolic reactions in
the human metabolic network often yield predictions with greatly improved accuracy and utility
compared to smaller dynamic metabolic models which are missing these genome-scale
interactions ​(Orth et al., 2010)​. Because of these advantages, FBA has led to many successful
predictions in cancer metabolism, providing powerful insights into both cancer pathophysiology
and treatment strategies ​(Asgari et al., 2015; Folger et al., 2011; Gatto et al., 2015; Lewis and
Abdel-Haleem, 2013)​. Additionally, we used FBA to predict metabolic fluxes for reactions in
central carbon metabolism (glycolysis and TCA cycle) in TCGA melanoma tumors, and
compared them with GTEx normal skin tissues (​Fig. S5A​). Our analysis suggests that many
reactions had a statistically significant difference between melanoma tumors and normal skin,
with most glycolytic and some TCA cycle fluxes significantly increased in melanoma tumors
(​Fig. S5A)​ . Interestingly, similar analyses between ​BRAF​-mutated TCGA melanoma tumors
compared with TCGA non ​BRAF-​ mutated melanomas show no difference in predicted metabolic
fluxes through central carbon metabolism (​Fig. S5B​). By coupling FBA, gene expression, and
metabolomics screen, we show that the drug-insensitive melanomas have an increased
dependence on antioxidant system. This increased dependence could present a therapeutic

opportunity in melanomas. Indeed, our own results and recent reports inform that redox
modulation could be a viable strategy to improve the treatment outcomes ​(Bauer et al., 2017;
Cesi et al., 2017; Corazao-Rozas et al., 2013; Fruehauf and Trapp, 2008; Gorrini et al., 2013;
Yuan et al., 2018)​.
Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant antioxidant in the cell. It can be synthesized either ​de
novo or regenerated using NADPH as the substrate ​(Fan et al., 2014)​. ​De novo GSH
biosynthesis requires cysteine, which is imported into the cells by cystine/glutamate antiporter,
SLC7A11 ​(Ji et al., 2018; Shih and Murphy, 2001)​. Our data suggest that drug-insensitive
melanoma cells have both upregulated SLC7A11 expression, and higher predicted fluxes
through GSH regenerating GSR, suggesting an efficient maintenance of glutathione.
Intriguingly, drug-insensitive melanoma cells can also maintain higher levels of GSH, and
maximally utilize cysteine during treatment. In addition, the level of serine is higher in
drug-insensitive cells, and increased upon treatment. Since serine is a precursor of cysteine, it
may help cells maintain necessary levels of glutathione ​(Mattaini et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2017)​.
Therefore, we next questioned whether the modulation of GSH level affects drug sensitivity in
melanoma. Inhibition of SLC7A11, however, did not improve the effects of BRAFi in melanoma
cells, indicating that melanoma cells could maintain GSH levels through NADPH regeneration.
In contrast, GSH depletion by BSO enhanced the effects of combination. Thus, GSH modulation
appears as an exciting therapeutic target in melanoma. Efficient regeneration of GSH requires
sufficient NADPH, another important cofactor in cells. Our work focussed on NADPH oxidation
(consumption), and examined the contributions of several enzymes that convert NADPH to
NADP+. Sixteen out of top 50 enzymes that had the most effect on the predicted fluxes through
NADPH are known to be involved in NADPH production pathways. Examining the importance of
NADPH production in melanoma drug sensitivity is a possible area of future investigation. We
speculate that drug-insensitive melanoma cells may also possess a robust NADPH production
pathways.
Consistent with earlier reports ​(Cesi et al., 2017; Ravindran Menon et al., 2015; Vazquez et al.,
2013)​, we observed that BRAFi alone also induced ROS in melanoma. However, BRAFi
induced effects on melanoma cells could not be rescued by known antioxidants, suggesting that
effects of BRAFi on drug-insensitive melanoma cells are not solely due to ROS. Another
possibility is that drug-insensitive melanoma cells perhaps utilize their robust antioxidant system
to tolerate the induced ROS. Therefore, an increase in oxidative stress due to the combinations
identified here, possibly disrupts that redox balance. One such agent for combination, RSL3, is
known to induce ferroptosis in cancer cells. Our results are, thus, consistent with recent reports
that suggest ferroptosis-inducing drugs may enhance the current treatment options for
melanoma ​(Tsoi et al., 2018)​. Ferroptosis has recently been exploited in different cancer types
as an alternative way to reduce the fraction of drug-tolerant persister cells ​(Hangauer et al.,
2017; Viswanathan et al., 2017)​. Yet, one important consideration is that ROS is not one, but a
family of chemical species. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether different species of
ROS have different effects on melanoma cells. Further studies are required to ascertain the
species of ROS that have detrimental effects on melanoma cells. One could imagine this could

be cell-line or tumor specific, as gene regulatory network (GRN) has been linked with the ability
of cells to undergo metabolic plasticity ​(Jia et al., 2019; Paudel and Quaranta, 2019)​. Future
work seems necessary to also investigate the compensatory antioxidant pathways, and how
they help maintain redox homeostasis in melanoma cells ​(Harris et al., 2015)​.
In summary, using an integrative approach, we identify new vulnerabilities in melanoma cells,
that may extend beyond melanoma. We show that enhanced capacity of redox balance may
provide an early survival advantage in melanomas against MAPK pathway inhibition. We
propose that disrupting an antioxidant balance in melanomas offers a useful therapeutic target
against cells with reduced sensitivity to existing therapies.

METHOD DETAILS
Cell Culture and Chemical Reagents:
Single-cell derived ​BRAF-​ mutated SKMEL5 subclones were derived as previously described
(Paudel et al., 2018)​. ​BRAF-​ mutated melanoma cells (SKMEL5, WM88), including the SKMEL5
subclones, NRAS-mutated melanoma cells (SKMEL2), and NF1-mutated melanoma cells
(MeWO) were grown and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and Ham’s F-12
media (DMEM:F12, 1:1, Cat. No. 11330-032). Media were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island,
NY), and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were cultured in humidified
incubators that were CO2 and temperature (37​o​C) controlled. Cells were passaged 1–2 times
per week and were maintained as exponentially growing cultures for a maximum of less than 20
passages. All cells were tested for mycoplasma, and tested negative.
PLX4720 (Cat. No. S1152) and vemurafenib (Cat. No. S1267) were obtained from Selleckchem
(Houston, TX). Dabrafenib (Cat No. HY-14660), (1S,3R)-RSL3 (Cat No. HY-100218A),
Ferrostatin-1 (FER1, Cat No. HY-100579), Erastin (Cat No. HY-15763), (E)-Daporinad (FK866)
(Cat No. HY-50876) were obtained from MedChem Express (Monmouth Junction, NJ) and
solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a stock concentration of 10 mM. Powdered
L-Buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) (Product No. B2515), powdered Diphenyleneiodonium chloride
(DPI) (Product No. D2926), and powdered L-Glutathione reduced (GSH) were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. BSO, and GSH was freshly made at a stock concentration of 100 mM in H​2​O,
while DPI was solubilized in DMSO at a stock concentration of 10mM. CellRox​TM DeepRed
Reagent (Cat No. C10422) for oxidative stress detection was obtained from ThermoFisher
Scientific. Acetonitrile (AcCN) (Cat No. A955-1), Methanol (MeOH) (Cat No. A456-1) and water
(Cat No. W6-1), Optima LC-MS grade, for the mass spectrometry analysis were obtained from
ThermoFisher Scientific.
Cellular ROS Staining Assay and Quantification:
CellRox​TM DeepRed Reagent was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly,
melanoma cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with inhibitors for a duration
specified. Hydrogen Peroxide (H​2​O​2​) was used as a positive control. Cells were incubated with
1mM H​2​O​2 mixed with growth media for an hour before incubation with CellRox reagent. The
cells were then stained with 5uM CellRoxTM DeepRed reagent by diluting the probe in complete
growth media and incubated for 30 minutes at 37​o​C in tissue-culture incubators. Cells were then
washed with PBS three times and imaged through a 20x objective with a Cellavista HighEnd
Bioimager (SynenTec Bio-Services, Munster, Germany). Total ROS intensity was quantified by
image segmentation in Fiji, image processing package ​(Schindelin et al., 2012)​.
Bioinformatics Analysis Pipeline:
RNASeq of melanoma cell lines (SKMEL5 subclones) was performed as previously reported
(Meyer et al., 2019)​. Transcript count data from Gene Expression Omnibus (Accession number:
GSE122041, ​https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE122041​) was used for
downstream analysis performed in R (​https://www.r-project.org​). Differentially Expressed Genes

(DEGs) were selected by ANOVA on baseline gene expression on three SKMEL5-derived
subclones based on a statistical cutoff of Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) (false discovery rate
(FDR) < 0.001, log2-fold change (LFC) >1). Differential expression analyses were performed
using Bioconductor (​https://www.bioconductor.org​) packages DESeq2 ​(Love et al., 2014) and
edgeR ​(Robinson et al., 2010)​. Genes present in results from both pipelines: DESeq2, and
edgeR (common genes) were selected for further analyses. Of total 2165 DEGs, 1361 were
upregulated and 804 were downregulated on a pairwise comparison between SC10 and SC01.
Expressions of the identified DEGs were correlated against BRAFi sensitivity measured as DIP
rate at 8uM PLX4720 ​(Hardeman et al., 2017) for 10 melanoma cell lines in CCLE database
(Barretina et al., 2012)​. Only genes with Pearson’s correlation score of 0.5, and p < 0.05 were
selected as significantly correlated genes (SCGs). Of total 71 SCGs, 36 were positively
correlated, while 35 were negatively correlated. Functional Gene enrichment analyses were
performed using clusterProfiler ​(Yu et al., 2012)​, and returned Gene Ontology (GO) terms were
summarized using REVIGO ​(Supek et al., 2011)​.
Flux Balance Analysis (FBA):
FBA is a computational approach for predicting genome-scale steady-state metabolic fluxes in
samples of interest ​(Orth et al., 2010)​. Reaction fluxes throughout the metabolic network are
predicted by solving the optimization problem:
max ​f(​ ​v​)
subject to S​v​ = 0
and v​min,j​ ≤ v​j​ ≤ v​max,j
where if ​m and ​r are the number of metabolites and reactions in the metabolic network,
respectively, then ​v is a ​r x 1 vector of reaction fluxes to be solved for, S is the ​m x ​r
stoichiometric matrix of the metabolic network, v​min,j and v​max,j are constraints imposed on each
individual reaction flux, and ​f is an objective function that is maximized to maximize a particular
metabolic phenotype of interest. Recon3D version 3.01 was used as the core metabolic network
(Brunk et al., 2018)​.
To maximize the oxidation of NADPH to NADP​+ in the metabolic network, the following objective
function was used in all cellular compartments:
NADP​+​ + H​+​ → NADPH
This artificial sink on NADP​+ in turn maximizes the flux through existing metabolic reactions that
oxidize NADPH to NADP​+​. Individual reaction flux values were predicted by averaging the
minimum and maximum predicted fluxes from Flux Variance Analysis (FVA), which computes
the minimum and maximum obtainable flux for each reaction under the model constraints and
while maximizing the objective function above.
Personalized metabolic models for cell lines, tumors, and normal tissues were developed using
transcriptomic data from these respective samples as previously reported ​(Lewis et al., 2018)​.
Drug Combination Assay:

The dose-response curves are generated using a 2-fold dilution of single drugs at concentrated
indicated (highest) to zero (solvent the drug was dissolved in, either DMSO or H​2​O), all
concentrations contained equal percentage of the solvent used. For combination with PLX4720,
8μM PLX4720 was used as diluant, and serially diluted for second drug from highest
concentration to lowest. Direct measurements of cell counts were made using Cellavista
software and ImageJ macros as previously described ​(Hardeman et al., 2017; Harris et al.,
2016; Paudel et al., 2018)​. The drug-induced proliferation (DIP) rates are calculated using the
slope of the log2-normalized population curves after 24 hrs.
Antioxidant Rescue Assay:
For drug-combinations indicated, the dose-response curves are generated as described above.
For the indicated concentrations, two known antioxidants--reduced glutathione (GSH, 5mM),
and ferrostatin-1 (FER, 5μM) are added to the combinations at day 0, and replenished at 72 hrs
along with growth medium, inhibitors combination for the duration of the assay upto 6 days.
Metabolomics Analysis:
Sample Preparation:
The combined global untargeted-targeted metabolomic analysis used BRAF-mutated melanoma
cells (WM88, SKMEL5-SC10) treated with either DMSO or 8μM PLX4720 for 24 hrs. Cell pellet
samples were lysed using 400µL ice cold lysis buffer (1:1:2, ACN:MeOH:Ammonium
Bicarbonate 0.1M, pH 8.0, LC-MS grade) and vortexed well until the cells mixed well with the
solvent. Each sample was sonicated using a probe tip sonicator, 10 pulses at 30% power,
cooling down in ice between samples. A BCA protein assay was used to determine the protein
concentration for each individual sample, and adjusted to a total amount of protein of 200µg
total protein in 200 µL of lysis buffer. Heavy labeled standard molecules, Phenylalanine-D8
(CDN Isotopes, Quebec, CA), and Biotin-D2(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., MA, USA),
were added to each sample to assess sample handling steps. Samples were subjected to
protein precipitation by addition of 800µL of ice cold methanol (4x by volume), then incubated at
-80°C overnight. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to eliminate precipitated
proteins and the metabolite containing supernatant was dried ​in vacuo and stored at -80°C until
LC-MS analysis.
Global untargeted-targeted LC-MS/MS analysis:
For mass spectrometry analysis, metabolite extracts were reconstituted in 60μl of HILIC
resuspension buffer (AcCN/H​2​O, 90:10, v/v) and cleared by centrifugation. Quality control (QC)
samples were prepared by pooling equal volumes from each sample. Stable isotope labeled
standards, Tryptophan-D3, Carnitine-D9, Valine-D8, and Inosine-4N15, were added to each
sample to assess MS instrument reproducibility.
Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was performed on a high resolution Q-Exactive HF hybrid
quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped
with a Vanquish UHPLC binary system and autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen,
Germany). PRM was used to monitor 18 metabolites with the following parameters: MS scan at

60,000 resolution with an automatic gain control (AGC) of 1e6, max injection time (IT) of 100
ms, and scan range from ​m/z 70–1050. Following the MS scan, six MS/MS scans were acquired
at a resolution of 15,000, AGC value of 1e5, max IT of 50 ms,1.3 ​m/z isolation window and a
stepped normalized collision energy. The targeted-MS​2 (or PRM) method is a scheduled (± 2
min)inclusion list for the mass-to-charge ratios(​m/z) of the metabolites of interest. These data
are empirically derived based on previous LC-MS/MS analysis of pure (> 90%) standards.
​
MS and
MS/MS data-dependent acquisition (DDA) were also performed on the Q-Exactive HF
using the QC sample. Metabolite extracts (5uL injection volume) were separated on a SeQuant
ZIC-HILIC 3.5-μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm column (Millipore Corporation, Darmstadt, Germany)
held at 40°C. Liquid chromatography was performed at 200 μl min​−1 using solvent A (5mM
Ammonium formate in 90% water, 10% acetonitrile) and solvent B (5mM Ammonium formate in
90% acetonitrile, 10% water) with the following gradient: 95% B for 2 min, 95-40% B over 16
min, 40% B held 2 min, and 40-95% B over 15 min, 95% B held 10 min (gradient length 45 min).

MS analyses were acquired over a mass range of m/z 70-1050 using electrospray ionization
positive mode. MS scans were analyzed at a resolution of 120000 with a scan rate of 3.5 Hz.
The AGC target was set to 1 × 10​6 ions, and maximum ion IT was at 100 ms. Source ionization
parameters were optimized, these include: spray voltage - 3.0 kV, transfer temperature - 280
°C; S-lens - 40; heater temperature - 325 °C; sheath gas - 40, aux gas - 10, and sweep gas flow
- 1.
Tandem spectra were acquired using a data dependent acquisition in which one MS scan is
followed by 2, 4 or 6 MS/MS scans. MS/MS scans are acquired using an isolation width of 1.3
m/z,​ stepped NCE of 20 and 40, and a dynamic exclusion for 6 s. MS/MS spectra were
collected at a resolution of 15000, with an AGC target set at 2 × 10​5 ions, and maximum ion IT
of 100 ms. Instrument performance and reproducibility in the run sequence was assessed by
monitoring the retention times and peak areas for the heavy labeled standards added to the
individual samples prior to and during metabolite extraction to assess sample processing steps
and instrument variability(​Table S7​).
Metabolite data processing:
LC-MS/MS raw data were imported, processed, normalized and reviewed using Progenesis QI
v.2.1 (Non-linear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK). All MS, DDA and PRM sample runs were
chromatographically aligned against a QC reference run. Following peak picking, unique
spectral features (retention time and m/z pairs) were grouped based on adducts and isotopes,
and individual features or metabolites were normalized to all features. Further filtering was
carried out by removing features or metabolites that had >30% coefficient of variance.
