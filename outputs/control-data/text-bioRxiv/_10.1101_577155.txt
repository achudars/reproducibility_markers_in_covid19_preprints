Abstract

18

Background

19

Among middle-aged and elderly individuals, dietary habits have previously been

20

reported to differ between patients with and without periodontal disease.

21

However, in young adults, there are only a few reports that show a correlation

22

between nutrient/food intake and periodontal disease. Moreover, no report has

23

assessed

24

self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ) and periodontal disease.

25

Therefore, we assessed the correlation between dietary habits, determined

26

using a DHQ, and periodontal disease in young adult women who are likely to

27

develop a periodontal disease.

28

Methods

29

The participants were 120 healthy, non-smoking, female college students (mean

30

age, 20.4 ± 1.1 years) from two universities who did not have any systemic

31

disease. The participants were assessed for periodontal disease according to

32

community periodontal index (CPI) and were divided into two groups. Subjects

33

with a CPI code of 0, 1, or 2 were assigned to non-periodontal disease group

34

(non-PD), and subjects with a CPI code of 3 or 4 were assigned to periodontal

35

disease group (PD). Dietary habits were assessed using a DHQ. In addition,

36

physical status, level of difficulty in chewing food (dietary hardness), masticatory

37

performance, and quality of life (QoL) were assessed.

38

Results

39

The PD group had a significantly lower nutrient intake of minerals, fat,

40

water-soluble vitamins, and dietary fiber than the non-PD group. In terms of food

41

groups, the PD group consumed significantly lesser amounts of green and

42

yellow vegetables than the non-PD group. In addition, the PD group consumed

43

significantly lesser amounts of hard foods than the non-PD group.

44

Conclusion

45

Young adult women with a periodontal disease had a significantly lower

46

nutrient/food intake than young adult women without a periodontal disease.

1. Introduction

48

Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that begins in the gingiva

49

and spreads throughout the periodontal tissues, culminating to its destruction [1].

50

Periodontal disease occurs in young adulthood and progresses with age [2].

51

According to the results of the Survey of Dental Diseases 2016, the percentage

52

of persons in Japan with periodontal pockets of ≥4 mm increased with age [3].

53

Moreover, since 17.6% individuals aged 15-24 years and 32.4% individuals

54

aged 25-34 years have periodontal pockets of ≥4 mm, periodontal disease is

55

now known to be common among the elderly and the young adults. Among

56

middle-aged individuals, the prevalence of periodontal disease is higher in

57

women than in men. The decrease in estrogen levels after menopause leads to

58

a decrease in bone density, which causes the progression of alveolar bone

59

resorption, a symptom of periodontal disease [4]. Therefore, with age, women

60

are at a greater risk of developing periodontal disease than men [4].

61

It is important to prevent periodontal disease because it is known to affect

62

systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease [5], diabetes mellitus [6, 7],

63

and metabolic syndrome [8] and premature/low-birth-weight delivery [9, 10].

64

Previous studies assessing the causes and etiology of periodontal disease

65

mainly focused on oral microbes and surrounding host environment [11, 12].

66

Previously reported environmental factors predisposing the host to periodontal

67

disease include smoking habits, drinking habits [13], and dental hygiene [14].

68

In addition, the nutrients and food consumed have also been reported to

69

be correlated with periodontal disease. Shariq Najeeb et al. suggested that

70

decreased consumption of vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin C, which

71

has antioxidant activity, was highly associated with periodontal disease;

72

however, vitamin C supplementation was not effective in treating periodontal

73

disease [15]. Varun Kulkami et al. showed a similar intake of particular nutrients

74

in patients with and without periodontal disease. However, they pointed to a

75

possible correlation between consumed nutrients and periodontal disease status

76

[16]. In addition, Yoshihara et al. showed a negative correlation between the

77

intake of green and yellow vegetables and periodontal disease prevalence.

78

However, it has also been reported that a high intake of cereals, nuts, sugar,

79

sweets, and candy is positively correlated with the presence of periodontal

80

disease [17]. As described above, most of the previous studies on the effect of

81

diet/nutrient targeted elderly patients, with very few studies targeting the young

82

adults.

83

Our foods are divided into relatively hard foods and soft foods based on

84

physical properties. The hardness of food is regarded as the difficulty involved in

85

chewing, hereafter referred to as dietary hardness. Dietary hardness has been

86

assessed as an estimate of masticatory muscle activity for the habitual diet [28].

87

A positive correlation between dietary hardness and chewing muscle activity has

88

also been reported in a previous study [18].

89

Therefore, we aimed at assessing the correlation between dietary habits

90

and periodontal disease in young adult women. In addition, we assessed the

91

correlation between the intake of hard foods and periodontal disease.

2. Materials and Methods

95

2.1. Participants

96

One hundred and twenty-seven female college students from the Tokyo Medical

97

and Dental University and the Tokyo Healthcare University were recruited for the

98

study between February 2014 to March 2015.

99

The inclusion criteria were not having caries teeth and missing teeth excluding

100

third molars. On the other hand, the exclusion criteria were in the following; a

101

smoker, taking gastrointestinal disease drugs, dry mouth, impaired oral

102

movement and psychiatric illness.

103

After 6 smokers and 1 person taking gastrointestinal disease drugs were

104

excluded, 120 subjects (mean age, 20.4 years) were finally enrolled in the study.

105

One dentist with ≥5 years of experience in clinical trials assessed the subjects

106

for periodontal disease. Two other evaluators practiced the chewing gum and

107

gummy jelly tests in advance so that their results matched. The Ethical

108

Committee of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University (#1002) and Tokyo

109

Healthcare University (#25-8) approved the study protocols. All participants

110

provided written informed consent before enrolment in the study, and

111

experiments were performed following the guidelines in the Helsinki Declaration

112

on the use of human subjects for research.

113
114

2.2. Dietary assessment

115

Nutrient/food intake was measured using the self-administered diet history

116

questionnaire (DHQ). The validity and reliability of the DHQ have previously

117

been confirmed [19, 20]. The DHQ includes questions concerning the frequency

118

of consumption, the semi-quantitative portions of 151 food and beverage items

7

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/577155; this version posted March 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

119

consumed, general eating habits including skipping meals and eating irregularly,

120

use of dietary supplements, and major cooking methods. An ad hoc of food

121

composition in Japan was used to calculate the estimated dietary intake of

122

energy, food group items, and nutrients [21]. The nutrient/food intake was

123

converted to intake per 1,000 kcal of consumed energy. Since the total intake

124

was expected to vary with body size, physical activity, and energy intake the

125

nutrient/food intake was adjusted for total energy by using energy density (per

126

1,000 kcal) [22].

127
128

2.3. Estimation of dietary hardness

129

Dietary hardness was calculated using a previously described method [23]. Each

130

food intake was multiplied by each masticatory muscle’s activity for the habitual

131

diet. Subsequently, dietary hardness was obtained by dividing the total sum of

132

the above value by the energy intake.

133
134

2.4. Periodontal disease variables

135

Each participant underwent assessments for periodontics according to the

136

Community Periodontal Index (CPI) from code 0 to code 4 (code 0: health

137

periodontal conditions; code 1: gingival bleeding on probing; code 2: calculus

138

and bleeding; code 3: periodontal pocket 4–5 mm; and code 4: periodontal

139

pocket ≥6 mm) [24, 25]. Then, the participants were assigned to two groups,

140

namely, non-periodontal disease (non-PD) group for CPI codes 0-2 and

141

periodontal disease (PD) group for CPI codes 3-4.

142
143

2.5. Anthropometry

144

Age and self-reported body heights were obtained from the DHQ. The weight

145

and percentage of body fat were measured using a body composition meter

146

(Inner scan 50, TANITA corporation, Japan). Body mass index (BMI) was

147

calculated as body weight (kilograms) divided by the square of body height

148

(meters).

149
150

2.6. Measuring masticatory performance by using color-changeable

151

chewing gum and gummy jelly test

152

Mixing ability was measured using a color-changeable chewing gum

153

(Masticatory Performance Evaluating Gum XYLITOL, Lotte Co., Ltd, Tokyo

154

Japan). After mouth-rinsing with water for 15 seconds, the participants were then

157

strokes. Changes in color were assessed using a colorimeter (CR-13,

158

Konica-Minolta sensing, Tokyo, Japan), and then the mean values of L*, a*, and

159

b* in the CIELAB color system were measured. Thereafter, the ΔE values were

160

obtained using following the equation [26, 27].

161

E 

162

Comminution test was measured using a test gummy jelly (UHA Mikakuto Co.,

163

Ltd, Japan) and a reported scoring method [28]. The participants chewed the

164

test jelly on their preferred chewing side for a total of 30 strokes. Subsequently,

165

the chewed test jellies were evaluated on a scale of one to ten by using a visual

166

scoring method [29]. Higher scores represented better comminution.

The participants chewed the gum for 60

173

Age, height, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, nutrient/food intake, dietary

174

hardness, masticatory performance, and health-related QoL were compared

175

between the two groups by using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. JMP

176

Pro 11.0.0 (SAS) software was used for analyses. P < 0.05 was considered

177

statistically significant. Except for physical status, dietary hardness, and QoL, all

178

the other variables were log-transformed to achieve a normal distribution.

The mean age, body fat percentage, weight, height, and BMI of each group are

184

shown in Table 1. The average age of the participants was 20.4 ± 1.1 years.

185

Seventy-one subjects were assigned to the non-PD group, and 49 subjects were

difference between the two groups. The intake of minerals such as potassium,

195

calcium, magnesium, and iron was significantly lower in the PD group. Moreover,

196

the intake of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A, beta-carotene

197

equivalence, vitamin E, and vitamin K, was significantly lower in the PD group.

198

The intake of water-soluble vitamins, including pantothenic acid (vitamin B5),

3.3. Intake of different food groups

206

The results of food intake per 1000 kcal of energy for each group are shown in

207

Table 3. The intake of green and yellow vegetables and other vegetables was

208

significantly lower in the PD group than in the non-PD group. Although there was

209

no significant difference in the intake of seeds, nuts, and beans, their intake was

210

lower in the PD group. In addition, the intake of sugar, animal fats, and

211

beverages was higher in the PD group. When green and yellow vegetables and

212

other vegetables were analyzed (Table 4), the intake of carrots (among green

213

and yellow vegetables) and the intake of cabbage (among other vegetables)

214

were significantly lower in the PD group than in the non-PD group. Furthermore,

215

although there was no significant difference, the intake of broccoli, as a green

4. Discussion

239

In this study, the two groups showed significant differences in the intake of

240

several nutrients.

241

In previous studies, subjects with periodontal disease significantly

242

consumed less potassium and iron. In the present study, the intake of potassium

243

and iron in the PD group was significantly lower than that in the non-PD group,

244

which was consistent with that reported in previous studies. Magnesium is

245

known to be involved in bone and tooth formation. It was reported that in

246

40-year-old individuals, serum magnesium concentration is associated with the
19

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/577155; this version posted March 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

247

risk of periodontal disease [33]. The intake of magnesium was significantly lower

248

in the PD group in the present study. We, therefore, think that there is a

249

significant positive correlation between the presence of periodontal disease and

250

low intake of magnesium in not only the elderly but also in young adults. Both

251

animal and human studies have reported that a lack of calcium intake leads to

252

alveolar bone resorption [34, 35] and a decrease in bone density [36], indicating

253

that insufficient calcium intake might cause the progression of periodontal

254

disease. In addition, it was shown that the risk of periodontal disease associated

255

with calcium intake was observed in both men and women aged between 20 and

256

39 years (odds ratio; 1.99 and 1.84), only in men aged between 40 and 59 years,

257

and in neither men nor women aged ≥60 years [37]. In the present study, the

258

intake of calcium was significantly lower in the PD group. Therefore, we think

259

that low calcium intake is more strongly correlated with the presence of

260

periodontal disease in younger adults than in older adults.

261

In the present study, the intake of vitamin C was lower, although not

262

significantly, in the PD group, while the intake of vitamins A, K, and E and

263

beta-carotene were significantly lower. Among the elderly and smokers, the

264

prevalence of periodontal disease was reported to be associated with vitamin C

20

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/577155; this version posted March 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

265

intake. There was a weak but significant dose-response increase in the risk of

266

periodontal disease in subjects who had lower vitamin C intake [38]. Vitamin C is

267

known to suppress oxidative stress through its antioxidant activity [39]. In

268

addition, vitamins A and K [40] and vitamin E and beta-carotene [41] have

269

antioxidant activity. In previous studies, oxidative stress caused by reactive

270

oxygen species in the tissues surrounding the gingiva affects the onset of

271

periodontal disease [42]. Therefore, it was suggested that the antioxidant effect

272

of several vitamins contributed to the absence of periodontal disease in the

273

non-PD group. Low intake of folic acid is known to be related to increased

274

bleeding during probing [43, 44], which supports our findings that the intake of

275

folic acid was significantly lower in the PD group. In the present study, the intake

276

of pantothenic acid and vitamin B6, which are not known to have any correlation

277

with periodontal disease, was significantly lower in the PD group. Previous

278

reports have shown that decreased vitamin B complex intake reduced the

279

efficiency of access flap surgery for periodontal disease treatment [45].

280

However, the effect of each specific vitamin B in the complex on periodontal

281

disease treatment has not been shown yet. Based on our findings, it was

282

suggested that there is a positive correlation between the intake of pantothenic

21

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/577155; this version posted March 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

283

acid and vitamin B6, among the vitamin B complex, and the absence of

284

periodontal disease.

285

In a previous study, there was a significant positive correlation between the

286

intake of whole grains and the absence of periodontal disease because whole

287

grains contain dietary fiber [46]. Green and yellow vegetables and other

288

vegetables like whole grains contain soluble and insoluble dietary fibers.

289

Therefore, in this study, since the consumption of green/yellow vegetables and

290

other vegetables was higher in the non-PD group than in the PD group, we think

291

that dietary fibers play a protective role against the development of periodontal

292

disease.

293

It was reported that the risk for periodontal disease among elderly persons

294

with low intake of docosahexaenoic acid is approximately 1.5 times that among

295

those with high intake [47]. However, in the present study, there was no

296

significant difference in the intake of fatty acids between the two groups. N-3

297

polyunsaturated

298

eicosapentaenoic acid exert anti-inflammatory effects by blocking intracellular

299

signaling systems required for producing inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1,

300

IL-6, and TNF-α [47]. Therefore, the immunological differences between younger

301

adults and the elderly might have caused the difference in the findings between

302

the present study and previous studies.

303

This study showed that the PD group significantly consumed foods with

304

lower dietary hardness when compared with the non-PD group. Yanagisawa, et

305

al. classified foods into 10 ranks according to chewing muscle activity [18]. In the

306

study, carrots and cabbage were ranked 8th out of 10 (>1400 μV・ sec) and

307

carrots, cabbage, and lotus root were ranked 6th out of 10 (>1000 μV・sec). We

308

found that the non-PD group routinely consumed hard dietary foods when

309

compared with the PD group. The quantity of saliva secreted has been reported

310

to increase proportionally with an increase in chew number, chewing time, or

311

chewing muscle activity [48]. Saliva washes away residual food particles and

312

bacteria in the mouth. Saliva also contains lysozyme, amylase, peroxidase, and

313

the proteins lactoferrin and IgA which possess antibacterial activity [49, 50].

314

Therefore, we think that eating foods with high dietary hardness (as seen in the

315

non-PD group) protects against periodontal disease through oral washing and

316

antibacterial activity resulting from increased saliva secretion.

317

In the present study, the participants in the PD group accounted for 40.8%

318

of the total participants. The 2016 Survey of Dental Diseases reported that

23

319

women aged 20 to 24 with periodontal disease accounted for 16.7% of the total

320

population [3]. Thus, the high prevalence of periodontal disease observed in our

321

study population is likely because we did not comprehensively diagnose

322

periodontal disease by using multiple diagnostic methods. Our diagnoses were

323

based only on the CPI, which might have resulted in the observed high

324

prevalence.

325

Presently, dietary or nutritional studies assessing how diet/nutrition can be

326

helpful in the prevention or treatment of periodontal disease are lacking.

327

Therefore, more studies are required to elucidate the connection between

328

periodontal disease and diet/nutrition. In addition, longitudinal studies on dietary

329

habits that effectively prevented or suppressed the progression of periodontal

330

disease are warranted.

334

Under the limited conditions of the present study, the intake of minerals

beta-carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin K), water-soluble vitamins (pantothenic
