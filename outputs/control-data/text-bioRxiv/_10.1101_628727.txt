Abstract
Population reduction is generally assumed to reduce the population’s genetic diversity and hence
its ability to adapt to environmental change. However, if life history traits that promote gene flow
buffer populations from such impacts, conservation efforts should aim to maintain those traits in
vulnerable species. Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) has experienced population
reduction by 95% due to poaching during the 20th century. We hypothesize that opportunities for
gene flow provided by their sex-specific migration buffered their genetic diversity from the
poaching impacts. We measured the mtDNA (control region, CR) and nuDNA (microsatellites or
STRs) diversity, population differentiation, along with the change in effective population size
(pre-poaching era vs. post-poaching era) and tested for a genetic bottleneck. Our results showed
that Tibetan antelope maintained considerable genetic diversity in both mtDNA CR and STR
markers (!" = 0.9970 and !#$% = 0.8446, respectively), despite a marked reduction in postpoaching effective population size 368.9 (95% CI of 249.3 - 660.6) compared to the pre-poaching
average (4.93×103 - 4.17×104). Post-poached populations also had low population structure and
showed no evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Pairwise &%' values using CR haplotype frequencies
were higher than those using STR allele frequencies, suggesting different degrees of gene flow
mediated by females and males. This study suggests that the Tibetan antelope’s sex-specific
migration buffered their loss of genetic diversity in the face of severe demographic decline. These
findings highlight the importance of recognizing the traits likely to maintain genetic diversity and
promoting conservation efforts that allow them to be exercised. For Tibetan antelope, this
requires assuring that their migration routes remain unobstructed by growing human
disturbances while continuing to enforce anti-poaching law enforcement efforts.

Introduction
Biodiversity conservation is one of the most important priorities in conservation biology, where
genetic diversity is an essential pillar. The need to conserve genetic diversity within populations
is based on two arguments: (1) the necessity of genetic diversity for evolution in response to
changing environments (Lacy, 1987; Morris, Austin, & Belov, 2012); (2) the expected correlation
between genetic diversity and population fitness (Reed & Frankham, 2003) and links to the
“extinction vortex” from inbreeding depression among fragmented populations (Frankham, 2005;
Keller & Waller, 2002). Many natural populations have experienced severe demographic
reduction due to rapid human population growth, overexploitation, environmental change, and
habitat fragmentation. While it is generally assumed that population decline can drive the loss of
genetic diversity, some species are able to maintain high genetic diversity even after a significant
population crash (Busch, Waser, & DeWoody, 2007; Gonzalez-Suarez, 2010; Hailer et al., 2006;
Kuo & Janzen, 2004; Lippé, Dumont, & Bernatchez, 2006; O’ Donnell, Richter, Dool, Monks, &
Kerth, 2015). In such cases, life-history traits appear to buffer against the loss of genetic diversity
in response to population declines (Hailer et al., 2006; Kuo & Janzen, 2004; Lippé et al., 2006).
The life history of many migratory species offers great opportunities for gene flow via migration,
introducing new alleles to the existing genetic diversity that might otherwise be lost from genetic
drift (Busch et al., 2007; Frankham, 2015; Jangjoo, Matter, Roland, & Keyghobadi, 2016).
About one million Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) ranged across the Tibetan
Plateau in the early 20th century (Buzzard, Wong, & Zhang, 2012). However, Tibetan antelope
populations were reduced to the brink of extinction at the end of the 20th century by illegal
poaching for their underfur, which was used to Shahtoosh shawls. Its population size reached a
low of 50,000 individuals in 2003, declining by 95% relative to its size in 1950 (Leclerc, Bellard,
Luque, & Courchamp, 2015). International conservation efforts successfully curbed the poaching
through law enforcement and habitat protection, and by 2011, the number of Tibetan antelope
was estimated to have increased to 200,000 individuals (Leclerc et al., 2015). The severe
population reduction due to illegal poaching raised concerns regarding the genetic viability of
Tibetan antelope populations and how it would affect their recovery.
Previous studies suggested that Tibetan antelope populations maintained high genetic
variation with no signs of population structure (Ahmad et al., 2016; Du et al., 2016; H. Zhou, Li,
Zhang, Yang, & Liu, 2007), although the genetic effects of the population crash on Tibetan
antelope remain unclear. We hypothesize that the unique life history of Tibetan antelope may
have buffered them against the loss of genetic diversity. Every summer, female Tibetan antelope
from different wintering grounds migrate to the common calving ground to give birth, leave
shortly after parturition and migrate back to their original wintering grounds with their newborn
calves. However, not all females migrate back to their original wintering grounds (Buho et al.,
2011). Male movements may also promote gene flow since there are no obvious geographic
barriers on the Tibetan Plateau, although the movement of males remains unknown (Schaller,
1998). We assess the genetic diversity, population differentiation, population structure and
effective population size of Tibetan antelope with maternal mtDNA (control region or CR) and
bi-parental genetic markers (microsatellites or STRs). We predict that due to sex-specific
migration, 1) there will be no obvious population structure; 2) differences in sex-specific
migration could be reflected by population differentiation values using maternal markers vs. bi-

show no signs of a population bottleneck.

Materials and methods
Ethics Statement
Tibetan antelope is listed in the Category I of the National Key Protected Wild Animal Species
under the China’s Wild Animal Protection Law. In September 2016, Tibetan antelope was
reclassified on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List from
Endangered to Near Threatened due to their increased population size. Sample collection and
field studies adhered to the Wild Animals Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China.
Fresh scat samples were collected under IACUC protocol #2850-12. Dry skin samples and
placenta samples were acquired with approval from the Forestry Department of Qinghai
Province, China.
Study Area and Sampling
We define all wintering grounds from which females that migrate to the same common calving
ground as a deme. This unique migration pattern repeats itself for all the common calving
grounds across the Tibetan Plateau (Schaller, 1998). The within-deme study focused on Zhuonai
Lake in Kekexili Nature Reserve park (KKXL), Qinghai, China, which is the largest common
calving ground for Tibetan antelope. Females from nearby wintering grounds migrate to Zhuonai
Lake to give birth. Animals were observed with binoculars from a vigilance distance of ~ 300m
(Lian, Li, Zhou, & Yan, 2012) until they defecated and left the area. A total of 383 fresh scat
samples were collected along with the date and GPS coordinates in ten different wintering
grounds in KKXL (KKXL1 - KKXL10) and around the calving ground Zhuonai Lake
(KKXL_ZNH). Samples were kept frozen until lab analyses. The among-deme study focused on
three geographic populations of Tibetan antelope on the Tibetan Plateau, including the KKXL,
examined above, along with Aerjin (AEJ) and Qiang Tang (QT) populations, using dry skin
samples and placenta samples. The total sample size for the among-deme study was 141 (KKXL,
N=69; AEJ, N=20; QT, N=52). See Figure 1 for sampling locations and Supplemental Table 1 for
detailed sampling information.
DNA extraction and amplification
Fecal DNA was extracted and processed using the swabbing method (Wasser, Keim, Taper, &
Lele, 2011). DNA in dry skins and placenta samples was extracted using the standard
Phenol/Chloroform method (Strauss, 2001). mtDNA CR was amplified and sequenced in all
samples using the forward primer DF (5’ ACCAGAGAAGGAGAACTCACTAACCT 3’) and
the reverse primer DR (5’ AAGGCTGGGACCAAACCTAT 3’). PCR was conducted using the
Qiagen Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen Inc.,) with 0.5 μl 500 μg/mL of bovine serum albumin (BSA).
We followed the recommended thermocycling conditions of the kit with an annealing
temperature of 51° C.

Different sets of STR loci were used for within-deme and among-deme studies. The
within-deme study used six STR loci denoted BM1824, MCM38, ILSTS005, MB066, BM1225,
and BM4107 (see Supplemental Table 2A) with the 5’ end of forward primers fluorescently
labeled with dyes 6-FAM or HEX. Annealing temperatures for PCR reactions for each locus were
shown in Supplemental Table 2A. Fragment analysis was conducted on the ABI 3730 xl DNA
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Alleles were scored with GeneMarker software (SoftGenetics,
LLC.), and checked manually. We used duplicate fecal extracts and each extract underwent at
least two independent PCR reactions to confirm allele profiles and guard against allelic dropout.
Genotypes were classified as heterozygotes if both alleles were observed at least twice with no
other alleles present, and homozygotes if only a single fragment was observed at least three times
with no other alleles present. The among-deme study used seven STR loci denoted L01, L03,
L04, ILSTS005, TGLA68, MCM38, and BM1341 (see Supplemental Table 2B). Amplification of
these seven loci used the same protocol described in the within-deme study, but with a single
extract amplified once per sample due to higher DNA yield.
Mitochondrial CR sequence analyses
mtDNA CR sequences from both the within and among-deme studies were pooled together. All
sequences were aligned using the software CLC Main Workbench (Qiagen, Inc). DnaSP v5.10.01
(Librado & Rozas, 2009) was used to determine the number of CR haplotypes (H), the number of
segregating sites (S), haplotype diversity (!" ) (Nei, 1978) and !" standard deviation, nucleotide
diversity (π) (Nei, 1978) and π standard deviation. We performed network analyses by
constructing median-joining networks (Bandelt, Forster, & Rohl, 1999) on the control region
haplotypes using the software PopART 1.7 (http://popart.otago.ac.nz).
Nuclear STR analyses
Expected heterozygosity (!()* ) observed heterozygosity (!,-. ), polymorphic information
content (PIC) and estimated null allele frequency (&/011 ) and combined probability of identity
(PI, the probability of two independent samples having the save identical genotype by chance)
were calculated using CERVUS v3.0.3 (Kalinowski, Taper, & Marshall, 2007). R packages pegas
(Paradis, 2010) and poppr (Kamvar, Tabima, & Grünwald, 2014) were used to perform the exact
test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and Linkage Equilibrium, respectively, using the
Monte Carlo test with 1,000 iterations. Significance level was adjusted with sequential
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Duplicate samples from the same genotypes
were identified and excluded with the software CERVUS v3.0.3 (Kalinowski et al., 2007).
We evaluated population structure using Bayesian inference with the software
STRUCTURE v2.2.3 considering an admixture model with correlated allele frequency (Pritchard,
Stephens, & Donnelly, 2000). The individuals were assigned to possible genetic groups, K,
varying from one to ten without a priori definition of populations. Twenty independent MCMC
runs were carried out with 500,000 iterations following a burn-in period of 500,000 iterations for
each value of the number of clusters (K). The best estimate of K was determined from both the
likelihood of K and the ad hoc statistic delta K (Evanno et al. 2005). Genetic structure was also

accessed through a discriminant analysis on principal components (DAPC) (Jombart, Devillard,
& Balloux, 2010) implemented in the adegenet R package (Jombart, 2008).
Population Differentiation Estimate
Pairwise &%' was assessed with 20,000 permutations in Arlequin v3.5.2 (Excoffier & Lischer,
2010) for mtDNA CR and STR data respectively. We performed an analysis of molecular
variance (AMOVA) (Excoffier, Smouse, & Quattro, 1992) using Arlequin v3.5.2 to understand
how genetic variation is partitioned. The significance of the proportion of variation at each
category was obtained by MCMC test with 20,000 permutations. Isolation-by-distance (IBD)
between Euclidean geographical distances and genetic distances (&%' ) were assessed using the
Mantel test (Mantel 1967) with the hierfstat R package (Goudet, 2005) and 20,000 permutations.
Significance values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction (Rice
1989).
Effective Population Size (23 ) Estimation
We estimated historical (pre-poaching) and contemporary (post-poaching) effective population
sizes of Tibetan antelope with the among-deme dataset. The historical effective population size
456 of the mitochondrial genome was calculated from the CR region using the estimate of the
female-specific theta (76 = 2456 :). 76 estimate was derived from LAMARC (Kuhner, 2006)
using Bayesian inference with 25 randomly selected samples, 10 initial search chains of 10,000
steps and 2 final chains of 1,000,000 iterations. A range of substitution rates (3.6 ×
10ABC to 1.8 × 10AG substitutions/site/gen) (Guo et al., 2006; Pesole, Gissi, De Chirico, &
Saccone, 1999) in the CR region was used to reflect uncertainty in :. The historical effective
population size 45 was calculated based on the parameter theta 7 = 445 : from LAMARC as
with the estimate of 76 . 45 was estimated with 25 random samples using a range of STR mutation
rates from 6 × 10AI JK 1.0 × 10AL mutations/locus/generation (Crawford & Cuthbertson,
1996; Waples & Do, 2008) and the same running configuration as mtDNA CR sequences. The
contemporary 45 was estimated using the linkage disequilibrium (LD) method in the software Ne
Estimator v.2 (Do et al., 2014) with Pcrit =0.01.
Detection of Bottlenecks
We used four approaches to determine whether the overall Tibetan antelope population
experienced a genetic bottleneck. First, we tested for allele frequency mode-shifts using
BOTTLENECK v. 1.2.02 (Piry, Luikart, & Cornuet, 1999). Secondly, we tested for the presence
of heterozygosity excess by using the one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test (Busch et al., 2007;
Cornuet & Luikart, 1996) implemented in BOTTLENECK v. 1.2.02. Heterozygote excess was
tested under all three STR mutation models: infinite alleles model (IAM), step-wise mutation
model (SMM) and two-phase model (TPM). For TPM, we set ps=0.9 (the frequency of singlestep mutations) and the variance of those mutations as 12 (Busch et al., 2007). Third, we
calculated the M-ratio, the mean ratio of the number of alleles to the range in allele size, using the
software M_P_VAL (Garza & Williamson, 2001). Critical values (Mc) set at the lower 5% tail of

the distribution were determined using the program CRITICAL_M. If the observed ratio is below
Mc, it can be assumed that the population has experienced a bottleneck (Garza & Williamson,
2001). To calculate Mc, we estimated three TPM parameters: ps, ∆g (the mean size of single-step
changes) and pre-bottleneck 7 = 445 :. We set ps = 0.9, and ∆g = 3.5. We varied 7 from 0.01 to
500, encompassing a wide range of biologically plausible values. To ensure this range of 7 values
was relevant, we estimated 7 using a common STR mutation rate : (5.0 × 10AZ
mutations/generation/locus) (Garza & Williamson, 2001) and 45 estimates from LAMARC.
Lastly, we employed coalescent simulations with the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
approach to infer past demographic history, as implemented in DIYABC v2.1.0 (Cornuet et al.,
2014; Cornuet, Ravigne, & Estoup, 2010). Simulations were conducted with STR and mtDNA
CR data separately. Only samples in the among-deme study were included. We compared two
competing scenarios, scenario 1 with constant 45 , and scenario 2 with population bottleneck
(Supplemental Figure 2). The parameter settings and priors were shown in the Supplemental
Table 3A & 3B and Supplemental method.

Results
Mitochondrial CR sequence analyses
The final alignment included 524 CR sequences of 1029 bp excluding insertions-deletions
(indels). In total, we found 381 different haplotypes. All three geographical populations (KKXL,
AEJ, QT) had high haplotype diversity (0.9890 - 1.000) and nucleotide diversity (0.0195 0.0241). The AEJ population had the largest standard deviation of haplotype diversity and
nucleotide diversity, probably due to its small sample size (18 haplotypes in 20 sequences) (Table
1). The within-deme analysis of samples from 10 wintering locations in KKXL (KKXL1KKXL10) revealed an overall pattern of haplotypes containing samples from multiple regions
and no clusters with geographical affiliation (Supplemental Figure 1). In total, there were 17
haplotypes shared among 10 sampling locations from KKXL. The among-deme analysis of
samples from KKXL, AEJ, and QT had a similar pattern (Supplemental Figure 1). There were
two haplotypes shared between AEJ and QT, one haplotype shared between AEJ and KKXL, and
one haplotype shared between QT and KKXL.
Nuclear STR analyses
The set of STRs used in both within and among-deme studies revealed high power and accuracy.
The combined probability of identity (PI) and sib identity ([sib) using all STRs in either study
showed in Supplemental Table 4. In the within-deme study, the number of STR alleles per locus
was 8-14, with an average of 11.167 (Table 2). All loci had high !()* (0.704 - 0.875) and PIC
(0.655 - 0.859), with mean !()* of 0.7767 and PIC of 0.7451. Most loci were in HWE and
Linkage Equilibrium across all populations after Bonferroni Correction. BM1824 violated HWE
in KKXL10 population and MB066 violated HWE across all populations. BM1824 and MB066
showed signs of an excess of observed homozygote genotypes as suggested by relatively large
positive &/011 values (0.0410 and 0.0715, respectively) (Table 2). It is difficult to identify a null

allele with certainty in the absence of a known parent-offspring relationship. Therefore, all loci
were kept for further analyses.
In the among-deme study, the number of STR alleles per locus was 7-24, with an average
of 14.714 (Table 2). All loci had high !,-. except TGLA68 (0.314), and high PIC (0.679-0.921),
with mean !()* of 0.8446 and PIC of 0.8242. Most loci were in HWE across all populations after
Bonferroni Correction. L03 violated HWE only in AEJ population and TGLA68 violated HWE
across all populations. All loci were in Linkage Equilibrium except the pair of L04 and TGLA68,
and L03 and L04. TGLA68 had a very high &/011 value of 0.4450 (Table 2). TGLA68 was
excluded from further analyses.
STRUCTURE analysis showed that the true K was equal to 1 for within and among-deme
studies. DAPC analyses showed that there was no clear separation of 10 wintering locations
within KKXL, and a high degree of overlap among the three geographical populations, KKXL,
AEJ and QT (Figure 2).
Population Differentiation Estimate
Population differentiation among geographic populations KKXL, AEJ and QT was low (Table 3),
and only the &%' value calculated between AEJ and QT was significantly different from zero
(Table 3). Pairwise &%' values were higher using the CR haplotype frequencies than the STR
allele frequencies. Most genetic variation was attributed within populations instead of among
populations (\ values from AMOVA tests were 0.2308 and 0.3856 for CR haplotype frequency
and STR allele frequency respectively). No significant correlation was detected between
linearized genetic distances and geographic distance among KKXL, AEJ, and QT (\ values from
Mantel tests were 0.827 and 0.486 for CR haplotype frequency and STR allele frequency
respectively).
Effective Population Size
The most probable estimate of 76 from LAMARC was 0.084343 (95% CI 0.053719 - 0.134826)
and the most probable estimate of 7 from LAMARC was 9.989892 (95% CI 9.850306 10.01527). The long-term estimate of 456 was in the range of 1.53 × 10] - 1.79 × 10G , and the
long-term estimate of 45 was in the range of 4.93 × 10L - 4.17 × 10Z . The contemporary 45
estimate was 368.9 (95% CI of 249.3 - 660.6).
Bottleneck Analyses
The mode-shift test did not detect any evidence of a bottleneck (Table 4). Heterozygosity excess
was detected only under the IAM mutation model (Table 4). While using ∆g=3.5, most M-ratio
values were above the critical value thresholds except for the small pre-bottleneck 7 values (0.01,
0.1 and 0.5) (See Table 4), which were very unlikely because historically Tibetan antelope had a
large effective population size. All calculated M-ratios were above the suggested threshold value
of 0.68 identified by Graza and Williamson (2001) for bottlenecked populations. ABC method
also didn't support the scenario of a population bottleneck. The best-supported model was
constant population size model, with a posterior probability of 0.5258 (95% confidence interval

CI: 0.5150 - 0.5366) for STR, and a posterior probability of 0.7142 (95% confidence interval CI:
0.7055 - 0.7229) for mtDNA CR sequences (Supplemental Figure 3). Analyses to estimate
confidence in scenario choice indicated that type I (false-positive) and type II (false-negative)
errors for the best-supported scenario (scenario 1 with constant 45 ) were high (0.438 and 0.389
for STR, 0.320 and 0.455 for mtDNA CR), suggesting low confidence in choosing the true
scenario. Point estimate for 45 was 4.44 × 10I (95% CI: 2.29 × 10I - 9.45 × 10I ) and
1.05 × 10Z (95% CI: 4.80 × 10L - 1.93 × 10Z ) for mtDNA CR and STR respectively.

Discussion
This study tests the hypothesis that sex-specific migration can buffer populations from the
impacts of population reduction with the case of migratory Tibetan antelope populations. Our
results showed that 1) Tibetan antelope maintained high genetic diversity in both mtDNA CR and
STR markers after a historical population decline; 2) No population bottleneck was detected; 3)
There was no obvious population structure among three geographical populations, which is a sign
of high gene flow among populations. Males are likely to play a bigger role in gene flow than
females since pairwise &%' values were higher using the maternal CR haplotype frequencies than
the biparental STR allele frequencies. This study suggests that the Tibetan antelope’s sex-specific
migration reduces their loss of genetic diversity in the face of severe demographic decline.
However, Tibetan antelope has not fully recovered from poaching in terms of effective
population size. There is a marked reduction in post-poaching effective population size 368.9
(95% CI of 249.3 - 660.6) compared to the pre-poaching average (4.93 × 10L - 4.17 × 10Z ).
Tibetan antelope maintained high genetic diversity after a historical population decline
Overall, CR haplotype diversity (!a ) was 0.9975 and π was 0.02026. The mean !()* of STR loci
was 0.7767 and 0.8446 for the within and among-deme studies respectively. Our results are
consistent with previous studies (Du et al., 2016; F. Zhang, Jiang, Xu, Zeng, & Li, 2013). At the
species level, the genetic diversity of Tibetan antelope was higher than other endangered ungulate
species, such as Roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus: size 401bp; !a 0.6969; π 0.0190; !()*
0.46), Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica: size 277 bp; !a 0.785; π 0.0139) and Kashmir red deer
(Cervus elaphus hanglu: size 454 bp; !a 0.589; π 0.008; !()* 0.66) (Alpers, Van Vuuren,
Arctander, & Robinson, 2004; Campos et al., 2010; Mukesh, Kumar, Sharma, Shukla, &
Sathyakumar, 2015; Singh, Grachev, Bekenov, & Milner-Gulland, 2010).
No population bottleneck was detected
Neither the mode-shift, heterozygosity excess, M-ratio nor ABC method revealed strong evidence
of a population bottleneck. The mode-shift test did not detect any evidence of a bottleneck.
Heterozygosity excess was detected only under the IAM model. IAM is prone to incorrectly
detect heterozygosity excess in non-bottlenecked populations. Therefore, to be statistically
conservative, one should use the SMM or TPM when analyzing STR data to test for recent
bottlenecks (Luikart and Cornuet, 1998). The M-ratio approach detected bottleneck signatures,
but only under extreme conditions (very small 7 values), suggesting a weak signal, if any. The

model with constant population size has higher support over the model with population
bottleneck based on ABC method, though it has high Type I and II errors.
No obvious population structure was detected among three geographical populations
Despite large-scale sampling efforts, phylogenetic analysis with Bayesian inference, haplotype
network analysis of the CR region, STRUCURE and DAPC analyses of STR loci revealed no
obvious geographic structure for Tibetan antelope in AEJ, QT, and KKXL populations. The
Mantel test detected no IBD pattern with neither mtDNA CR nor STR loci. This finding suggests
historically wide gene flow, which is consistent with results of previous studies (F. Zhang et al.,
2013; H. Zhou et al., 2007).
There are no obvious geographic barriers blocking population exchange on the plateau.
During the course of female Tibetan antelope migration, it is possible that a number of females
from one population translocate to another. This would promote gene exchange between
populations of different localities, which is reflected by the shared haplotypes among different
populations (Supplemental Figure 1). However, males are likely to play a bigger role in gene flow
since pairwise &%' values were higher using the maternal CR haplotype frequencies than the
biparental STR allele frequencies. Tibetan antelope have a harem polygyny mating system, in
which a male generally mates with most or all of the females in his harem (5-10 females) during
the breeding season. Mate competition is an important driver explaining the spatial movement of
males among populations during the breeding season. Breeding dispersal is not restricted to
young males. It also occurs among prime-aged individuals and even among harem holders
(Jarnemo, 2011; Richard, White, & Côté, 2014).
Tibetan antelope has not fully recovered from poaching yet in terms of effective population
size
In 2003, the estimation of Tibetan antelope population size reached the lowest number of 50,000
individuals. Since then, the Tibetan antelope population has begun to recover, with about 200,000
individuals currently (Leclerc et al., 2015). Their protection status has been changed from
“endangered” to “near-threatened” by IUCN. However, our effective population size comparison
analyses suggest that Tibetan antelope has not yet fully recovered. Their contemporary 45
estimate is 368.9 (95% CI of 249.3 - 660.6), which is markedly lower than their long-term
45 average (4.93 × 10L - 4.17 × 10Z ). Long-term 45 estimate with ABC method using STR
loci is 1.05 × 10Z (95% CI: 4.80 × 10L - 1.93 × 10Z ), which mostly agrees with the estimate
with LAMARC method.
The contemporary Ne estimate has a wide confidence interval (95% CI of 249.3 - 660.6).
In the LD method implemented in Ne Estimator v.2, CI of 45 is an increasing function of
45 (Posada & Crandall, 2001; Waples & Do, 2010). Like all the other genetic methods for
estimating contemporary 45 , LD method is most powerful with small populations and has
difficulty distinguishing large populations from infinite ones. However, it should provide a useful
lower bound for 45 , which can be important in conservation biology where a major concern is
avoidance and early detection of population bottlenecks (Bandelt et al., 1999; Waples & Do,
2010).

Surprisingly, the mtDNA CR-based estimate of 456 (1.53 × 10] - 1.79 × 10G ) was
larger than the STR-based estimate 45 (4.93 × 10L - 4.17 × 10Z ). Long-term 45 estimate with
ABC method using mtDNA CR sequences is 4.44 × 10I (95% CI: 2.29 × 10I - 9.45 × 10I ),
which is lower than the estimate with LAMARC, but still larger than the STR-based estimate. In
theory, the mitochondrial genome has an effective population size one quarter that of an average
nuclear locus because of the different inheritance modes of nuclear and mtDNA, as well as the
haploid nature of the mitochondrial genome. The observed disparity between mtDNA and STRbased estimates could result from the Tibetan antelope’s mating system, historical demography,
mutation or all three combined. Tibetan antelope have a harem polygyny mating system, as
mentioned above. Non-independent mating paring has a large effect when there is intense malemale competition for reproduction in a harem social system and reduces 45 for wholly or
paternally inherited components of genome (Evans & Charlesworth, 2013; Nunney, 1996).
Historical events may also explain the apparent discord between mtDNA and STR-based of longterm population size. For instance, if the historical source populations that contributed to the
origin of the contemporary population were isolated from each other but with male-biased
dispersal, then the populations would more rapidly diverge at mtDNA loci than nuclear loci
because mtDNA is matrilineally inherited. A secondary contact of these isolates would merge a
relatively homogenous pool of nuclear genes, but mtDNA lineages would remain differentiated.
This evolutionary scenario is supported by our pairwise &%' results (Table 3) that Pairwise &%'
values were higher using the CR haplotype frequencies than the STR allele frequencies. 456 may
reflect the collective genetic diversity of all source populations, which would possibly contribute
to the reversal in expected sizes for 45 and 456 . Another possibility is that size homoplasy of
STRs might have obscured the signal on the historical origin of the study population. Some STR
alleles can be identical in size but may not identical by descent due to convergent mutations. Size
homoplasy is especially problematic in large populations (Estoup, Jarne, & Cornuet, 2002), such
as Tibetan antelope population. Thus, STR-derived 45 estimates may not reflect the composite
origin of these populations as well as 456 . Regardless of the ultimate cause of the discord
between 45 and 456 , all estimators indicate that the historical population size of Tibetan antelope
is very large.
How did Tibetan antelope maintain such high genetic diversity despite a massive population
decline?
We expected the Tibetan antelope to have suffered a serious population bottleneck from the near
95% decline in the original population due to poaching. However, we found no evidence of such
an event by any of the methods used in the study. Tibetan antelope still maintains high genetic
diversity.
The contemporary Ne of Tibetan antelope estimate was 368.9, with a wide 95%
confidence interval of 249.3 - 660.6, which is large enough to preclude losses of neutral genetic
diversity. Small populations caused by massive population reduction are at risk of extinction
vortex due to demographic stochasticity and random genetic drift. The genetic pool is seriously
impaired when the effective population size reduces below the threshold of 50, according to the
50/500 rule, which proposes that a population would need to begin with at least a population size
of 50 individuals to ensure enough initial genetic variation, and maintain a population size of 500

to keep the levels of genetic variation over time (Franklin, 1980).
It is also possible that insufficient time has passed since the start of population reduction
to markedly reduce Tibetan antelope genetic diversity. It is hard to detect a recent population
bottleneck, as reflected by the high type I and II error in DIYABC analyses. According to the
coalescent theory (Crow & Kimura, 1970), !' /!# (the ratio between heterozygosity at generation
t vs. generation 0) depends on (1 − 1/2N)' . For populations with fluctuating population size
from generation to generation, one should replace N with harmonic mean of the generationspecific effective sizes 45 * If we assume that the year 1950 is time 0 and 45 * = 249 (we chose the
lower bound of contemporary effective population size as 45 * to be conservative), by 2016 !' /!#
would be 0.936 (assuming generation time is 2 years). Thus, we would not expect to see a
significant loss of genetic diversity by genetic drift.
The high genetic variability in Tibetan antelope population after a population crash likely
reflects the effect of admixture. A few immigrants entering a population each generation can
counteract the effects of genetic drift and obscure any genetic signature of this population’s
decline. Increasing human activities on the Tibetan Plateau is now threatening this once-paradise
for wildlife. Habitat fragmentation, such as fencing and road construction, might affect gene flow
among populations, leading to local extinction that could impede Tibetan antelope population’s
recovery (X. Su et al., 2015; Zhuge, Li, Zhang, Gao, & Xu, 2014).

Future Research Recommendations
We acknowledge that the few loci used in this study provide limited resolution and considerable
uncertainty for demographic inference. Each locus on the genome has a particular genealogy
describing its history. Genetic data using a few loci only provides a few numbers of possible
genealogies for the underlying demography. The only way to reduce the uncertainty of the
demographic model is to sample throughout the entire genome, which will contain a wealth of
information for demographic inference.
When the changes in genetic diversity are assessed for endangered populations, it is
essential to establish a baseline representing the pre-poaching conditions (Matocq & Villablanca,
2001). The use of archival (e.g. museum samples) specimens may allow for a powerful test of
loss in genetic diversity over time. If archival reference samples represent genetic variation found
in a population prior to the events leading to endangered status (e.g. samples from the prepoaching era), such samples would provide the most appropriate reference against which to
measure current levels of diversity (Bouzat, Lewin, & Paige, 1998).

Figure 1 Sampling locations used for the among-demes study (left) and the within-demes
study (right). Note: In the within-demes study, fresh scat samples were collected in ten
different wintering grounds in KKXL (KKXL1 - KKXL10) and around the calving ground
Zhuonai Lake (KKXL_ZNH). The among-deme study focused on three geographic populations
of Chiru on the Tibetan Plateau, including the KKXL, examined above, along with Aerjin (AEJ)
and Qiang Tang (QT) populations.
