in SAC signalling and, importantly, what inhibits PLK1 signalling to
allow MELT dephosphorylation and SAC silencing upon
microtubule attachment.

ABSTRACT
Local phosphatase regulation is critical for determining when
phosphorylation signals are activated or deactivated. A typical
example is the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis,
which regulates kinetochore PP1 and PP2A-B56 activities to
switch-off signalling events at the correct time. In this case,
kinetochore phosphatase activation dephosphorylates MELT
motifs on KNL1 to remove SAC proteins, including the BUB
complex. We show here that, surprisingly, neither PP1 or PP2A
are required to dephosphorylate the MELT motifs. Instead, they
remove polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) from the BUB complex, which
can otherwise maintain MELT phosphorylation in an
autocatalytic manner. This is their principle role in the SAC,
because both phosphatases become redundant if PLK1 is
inhibited or BUB-PLK1 interaction is prevented. Therefore,
phosphatase regulation is critical for the SAC, but primarily to
restrain and extinguish autonomous kinase activity. We propose
that these circuits have evolved to generate a semi-autonomous
SAC signal that can be synchronously silenced following
kinetochore-microtubule tension.

Our results demonstrate that two KNL1-localised phosphatases –
PP1-KNL1 and PP2A-B56 –antagonise PLK1 recruitment to the BUB
complex. This is crucial, because otherwise the BUB-PLK1 module
primes further BUB-PLK1 recruitment to sustain the SAC in an
autocatalytic manner. In fact, this is the primary role of both
phosphatases in the SAC, because when PLK1 and MPS1 are
inhibited together, MELTs dephosphorylation and SAC silencing
can occur normally even when PP1 and PP2A are strongly
inhibited. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the main role of
KNL1-localised phosphatases is to suppress a semi-autonomous
SAC signal that is driven by MPS1, but sustained by PLK1 and
positive feedback.

RESULTS
PP1-KNL1 and PP2A-B56 antagonise PLK1 recruitment to the BUB
complex
Inhibition of PP1-KNL1 or knockdown of PP2A-B56 both enhance
PLK1 recruitment to kinetochores 28,29. To test whether this was
due to localised phosphatase inhibition at the BUB complex, we
inhibited the recruitment of PP2A-B56 to BUBR1 (BUBR1PP2A) and
compared this to a PP1-KNL1 mutant (KNL1PP1), as used
previously 16,29 (note, that in these and all subsequent
experiments, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown was used in
combination with doxycycline-inducible replacement of the wild
type or mutant gene from an FRT locus: see methods). This
demonstrated that removal of either PP1 from KNL1 or PP2A-B56
from BUBR1 increased PLK1 levels at unattached kinetochores
(Figure 1A). We suspected that the increased PLK1 was due to
enhanced binding to the BUB complex, because depletion of BUB1
and/or BUBR1 also removes the BUBR1:PP2A-B56 complex from
kinetochores, but this did not enhance PLK1 levels (Figures S1A-C).
In fact, kinetochore PLK1 was considerably reduced when the
whole BUB complex was removed (see siBUB1 + siBUBR1 in Figures
S1A-C). PLK1 binds via its PBDs to CDK1 phosphorylation sites on
BUB1 (pT609 21) and BUBR1 (pT620 20,22), therefore we raised
antibodies to these sites and validated their specificity in cells
(Figure S1D). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that
phosphorylation of both sites is enhanced at unattached
kinetochores in KNL1PP1 or BUBR1PP2A cells (Figures 1B-C, S1E-F).
This is the reason that PLK1 kinetochore levels increase when PP2A
is removed, because the elevated PLK1 levels can be attenuated
by BUBR1-T620A mutation (Figure 1D) and completely abolished
by additional mutation of BUB1-T609A (Figure 1E). Therefore,
these data demonstrate that PP1-KNL1 and BUBR1-bound PP2AB56 antagonise PLK1 recruitment to the BUB complex by
dephosphorylating key CDK1 phosphorylation sites on BUBR1
(pT620) and BUB1 (pT609) (Figure 1F).

INTRODUCTION
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents mitotic exit until
chromosomes have attached to microtubules via the kinetochore
1,2. MPS1 kinase initiates SAC signalling by localising to unattached
kinetochores and phosphorylating the SAC scaffold KNL1 on repeat
motifs known as ‘MELT repeats’ (for the amino acid consensus
Met-Glu-Leu-Thr) 3-5. Once phosphorylated, these MELT motifs
recruit the heterotetrameric BUB1-BUB3-BUB3-BUBR1 complex
(hereafter BUB complex) to kinetochores 6-9, which, directly or
indirectly, recruits all other proteins needed to activate the SAC
and block mitotic exit 1,2. Once kinetochores attach to
microtubules, the local SAC signal must be rapidly extinguished by
at least three different mechanisms: 1) localised MPS1 activity is
inhibited 10-12, 2) key phosphorylation sites, such as the MELT
repeats, are dephosphorylated by KNL1-localised phosphatases 1317, and 3) dynein motors physically transport SAC components
away from kinetochores down microtubules 18.
One key unexplained aspect of SAC signalling concerns the role of
polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) 19. PLK1 interacts via its polo-box domains
(PBDs) to phospho-epitopes on various different kinetochore
complexes, including to two CDK1 phosphorylation sites on the
BUB complex (BUB1-pT609 and BUBR1-pT620) 20-22. PLK1 has
similar substrates preferences to MPS1 23,24 and it shares at least
two key substrates that are critical for SAC signalling: the KNL1MELT motifs and MPS1 itself, including key sites in the MPS1
activation loop 25-27. PLK1 can therefore enhance MPS1 kinase
activity and also directly phosphorylate the MELT motifs to
support SAC signalling, perhaps from its localised binding site on
BUB1 27. It is unclear why PLK1 is needed to cooperate with MPS1

PP1-KNL1 and PP2A-B56 antagonise PLK1 to allow SAC silencing

timepoints/treatment by eye: see methods). Therefore, when
kinetochore phosphatase recruitment is inhibited, PLK1 becomes
capable of supporting the SAC independently. This is due to
enhanced PLK1 levels at the BUB complex, because MELT
dephosphorylation and SAC silencing are also rescued if MPS1 is
inhibited when the PLK1 binding motif on BUBR1 is mutated
(BUBR1PP2A-T620A, Figure 2E-F). Collectively these data
demonstrate that excessive PLK1 levels at the BUB complex can
sustain the SAC when KNL1-localised phosphatases are removed
(Figure 2G). Therefore, these phosphatases promote SAC silencing
by antagonising PLK1 recruitment to BUB1 and BUBR1. This raises
the important question of whether PLK1 removal from the BUB
complex is the only critical role for these phosphatases in the SAC,
or whether they are additionally needed to dephosphorylate the
MELT repeats, as previously assumed 13-17.

PLK1 is able to support SAC signalling by phosphorylating the MELT
motifs directly 25-27. Therefore, we hypothesised that the increased
BUB-PLK1 levels in KNL1PP1 and BUBR1PP2A cells could help to
sustain MELT phosphorylation and the SAC in the absence of MPS1
activity. To address this, we examined the effect of PLK1 inhibition
with BI-2536 under these conditions. Figures 2A-B and S2A show
that MELT dephosphorylation and mitotic exit are both attenuated
following MPS1 inhibition in nocodazole-arrested KNL1PP1 or
BUBR1PP2A cells, as demonstrated previously 16,17.
Importantly, however, these effects are rescued if PLK1 and MPS1
are inhibited together (Figures 2C-D and S2B) (note, the thick
vertical bars in these violin plots display 95% confidence intervals,
which can be used for statistical comparison of multiple

There is an approximate 5-10 min delay in MELT
dephosphorylation between wild type and KNL1PP1/BUBR1PP2A
cells when MPS1 and PLK1 are inhibited together (blue vs red
symbols in Figure 2C). This could indicate a role for PP1/PP2A in
MELT dephosphorylation, or alternatively, it may reflect the time
it takes for BI-2536 to penetrate cells and inhibit PLK1, since both
inhibitors were added together at timepoint zero in this assay.
Therefore, we next sought to dissect if localised PP1 or PP2A
contribute directly to MELT dephosphorylation.

PP2A-B56 kinetochore recruitment is inhibited. This was
particularly surprising, because it implies that neither PP1 or PP2A
are essential for dephosphorylating the MELT repeats. This could
reflect redundancy between the two phosphatases, therefore we
attempted to remove both phosphatases from kinetochores by
combining PP2A-B56 and PP1 knockdown (Figure 3C) or
performing PP2A-B56 knockdown in KNL1PP1 cells (Figure 3D).
However, in both of these situations, MELT dephosphorylation was
indistinguishable from wild type cells if MPS1 and PLK1 were
inhibited together (Figures 3C-D and S3C-F). Finally, we treated
cells with a high dose of Calyculin A (50 nM) - a very potent
inhibitor of all PP1 and PP2A phosphatases (IC50 values, 1-2nM 30
– which can completely prevent MELT dephosphorylation and BUB
complex removal following MPS1 inhibition alone (Figures 3E and
S3G-I). However, even in this situation, the MELT motifs are still
dephosphorylated and the BUB complex is removed with fast
kinetics when MPS1 and PLK1 are inhibited together (Figures 3E
and S3G-I).

KNL1-MELT

PLK1 inhibition for 30 minutes was sufficient to reduce phosphoMELT in KNL1PP1 and BUBR1PP2A cells to levels comparable with
wild type cells (Figures 3A and S3A). Therefore, we next examined
MELT dephosphorylation rates when MPS1 was inhibited
immediately after this 30-minute inhibition of PLK1. Figures 3B
and S3B show that the MELT motifs are dephosphorylated with
very similar kinetics in this assay, irrespective of whether PP1 or

Therefore, these data demonstrate that neither PP1 or PP2A are
required to dephosphorylate the MELT motifs. Instead they are
needed to remove co-localised PLK1 from the BUB complex. This is
important because BUB1-bound PLK1 can otherwise prime its own
recruitment (via pMELT) and therefore maintain the SAC signal in
a semi-autonomous manner (Figure 4A).

KNL1. PLK1 is able to phosphorylate KNL1 on MELT motifs to
recruit further BUB complexes, which, directly or indirectly,
recruits all other proteins needed to generate the SAC signal 1,2,2527. Therefore, this positive feedback loop helps to maintain the SAC
in a semi-autonomous manner (pMELT→BUB:PLK1→pMELT,
Figure 4B, P1). Multiple MELT repeats are active on each KNL1
molecule 8,9,35 and multiple copies of KNL1 are present on each
kinetochore 36. Therefore, this creates over a thousand active
MELT repeats per kinetochore, which the BUB-PLK1 module can
use to rapidly amplifying SAC signalling downstream of MPS1.
Furthermore, this may be reinforced by an additional positive
feedback loop to MPS1 itself, since PLK1 can phosphorylate the
activation loop of MPS1 to stimulate its kinase activity 26,27,37
(MPS1→BUB:PLK1→MPS1, Figure 4B, P2). This may help to explain
the recent observation that this ‘autoactivation’ site remains
phosphorylated when MPS1 is inhibited in BUBR1PP2A cells 38. In
this case, PP2A removal may increase phosphorylation indirectly
via PLK1, instead of (or in addition to) preventing
dephosphorylation directly, as the authors propose. In summary,
positive feedback downstream of PLK1 explains why this kinase
cooperates with MPS1 to activate the SAC: it allows the SAC signal
to be establish in a rapid, semi-autonomous, manner. This also
explains why phosphatase regulation is critical to prevent these
positive feedback loops from locking the SAC signal into a
constitutive ‘on’ state.

DISCUSSION
Serine/threonine phosphatases were once considered slaves to
their kinase counterparts: kinases respond to regulatory inputs
whereas phosphatases provide the basal level of activity needed
for the kinases to act. A logical interpretation perhaps, considering
that phosphatases display little specificity in vitro and are encoded
by a relatively small number of genes that lack complex regulatory
elements. However, this kinase-centric view of signalling changed
when it became clear that phosphatases bind to substrates or
adaptors in a regulated manner using specific short-linear motifs
(SLiMs)31. In the case of PP1 and PP2A-B56, these SLiM interactions
can be either inhibited (PP1) or enhanced (PP2A-B56) by
phosphorylation inputs 32,33. We demonstrated recently that
kinetochores use these phosphatases primarily because of their
ability to be regulated in this way 34.
We build on this work here to show that PP1 and PP2A-B56
regulation is critical for the SAC, but primarily to determine when
localised kinase activity is extinguished. The kinase, in this case, is
PLK1 which is recruited via the BUB complex to the SAC scaffold

An important phosphatase in this regard is PP2A-B56, which is
recruited to the BUB complex by PLK1 itself 20,39-41. This create a
key negative feedback loop which allows PLK1 to restrain its own
activity (PLK1→PP2A⊣PLK1, Figure 4B, N1). This loop is crucial to
dampen the SAC signal, because when PP2A-B56 is removed, PLK1
recruitment is increased and the SAC can be sustained in a manner
that is dependent on PLK1, but largely independent of upstream
MPS1 activity (Figure 2). We hypothesise that this loop also
restrains PP2A-B56 activity to prevent it from fully removing PLK1
to silencing the SAC on its own. In support of this hypothesis, PP2AB56 can shut down the SAC if it is recruited to BUBR1 in a manner
that is independent of phosphorylation 34. This homeostatic SAC
regulation by phospho-dependent PP2A may be important to
preserve the BUB complex at kinetochores when microtubules
attach and MPS1 is removed/inhibited 10-12. The benefit of
preserving the SAC platform in this situation is that SAC signalling
can be rapidly re-established if microtubules subsequently detach.
However, if the correct bioriented stated is achieved and the
kinetochore comes under tension, then the PP1 arm is engaged 42,
which crucially, is not restricted by negative feedback (Figure 4B).
In fact, we speculate that this tension-dependent switch is
reinforced by positive feedback instead, because removal of PLK1
and the BUB complex may reduce the inhibitory Aurora B signal
emanating from centromeres 19,43.

below a certain threshold). It will be important to test this
hypothesis in future and to determine whether other signalling
pathways use a combination of regulated and unregulated
phosphatase activity to shut down localised processes in a rapid
synchronous manner. If phosphatase regulation has generally
evolved to restrain or extinguish localised kinase activity, as we
shown here for the SAC, then this regulation could be
therapeutically targeted to specifically elevate kinase activity in a
range of conditions. Recent work has demonstrated that inhibition
of a specific regulated phosphatase complex is both achievable
and therapeutically valuable 47,48.

In summary, by interrogating the specific role of PP1 and PP2A-B56
at kinetochores, we arrive at the conclusion that phosphatase
regulation is critical, but primarily to restrain and extinguish
localised kinase activities. The phosphatases are the metaphorical
slaves once again, but this time, they live up to their billing because
they are directly controlled by their kinase masters (i.e. by SLiM
phosphorylation 39-42). This is important because it is ultimately the
kinases that sense the microtubule attachment state of each
kinetochore, before relaying that information to the phosphatases
to determine whether the SAC signal stays on or shuts off (Figure
4B). In fact, in this final act, it is the slaves that are ultimately freed
to silence their kinase masters. It is interesting to note that other
organisms have evolved different circuits to control the SAC, but
even in these cases, phosphatase regulation appears to focus back
to limit kinase activity. In flies, the KNL1-MELTs are not phosphoregulated and MPS1/PLK1 activities are not required to recruit the
BUB complex to kinetochores 44,45. However, in this situation, PP1
binds directly to MPS1 to inhibit its activity and silence the
downstream SAC signal 46. Therefore, the use of regulated
phosphatases to silence local kinase activity may be a conserved
feature of SAC signalling.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Cell culture
All cell lines were derived from HeLa Flp-in cells (a gift from S
Taylor, University of Manchester, UK) 49 and authenticated by STR
profiling (Eurofins). The cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 9% FBS and 50 µg/ml penicillin/streptomycin.
During fluorescence time-lapse analysis, cells were cultured in
DMEM (no phenol red) supplemented with 9% FBS and 50µg/ml
penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were screened every 4-8 weeks to
ensure they were mycoplasma free.
Plasmids and cloning
pcDNA5-YFP-BUBR1WT expressing an siRNA-resistant and Nterminally YFP-tagged wild-type BUBR1 and pcDNA5-YFPBUBR1ΔPP2A (also called BUBR1ΔKARD), lacking amino acids 663-680
were previously described 16. These vectors were used to generate
pcDNA5-YFP-BUBR1T620A and pcDNA5-YFP-BUBR1ΔPP2A-T620A by site
directed mutagenesis. pcDNA5-YFP-BUB1WT expressing an siRNAresistant and N-terminally YFP-tagged wild-type BUB1 was
described previously 50 and used to generate pcDNA5-YFPBUB1T609A
by

directed
mutagenesis.
pcDNA5mTurquoise2(Turq2)-BUB1WT and pcDNA5-Turq2-BUB1T609A were
created by restriction cloning using Acc65I and BstBI to replace the
YFP originally present in pcDNA5-YFP-BUB1WT and pcDNA5-YFPBUB1T609A (Turq2 subcloned from pcDNA4-mTurq2-BUBR1WT 34).
pcDNA5-YFP-KNL1WT expressing an siRNA-resistant and Nterminally YFP-tagged wild-type KNL1 and pcDNA5-YFP-KNL1ΔPP1
(with RVSF at amino acids 58-61 mutated to AAAA, also called
KNL14A) were previously described 34. All plasmids were fully
sequenced to verify the transgene was correct.

One final important point concerns the fact that the ultimate
dephosphorylation of SAC substrates, such as the MELT motifs,
does not appear to depend on either PP1 or PP2A (Figure 3).
Instead, we speculate that it relies on a constitutive
phosphatase(s) that has unregulated basal activity. One advantage
of using a constitutive phosphatase in this situation, is that it can
reverse different signals in a synchronous manner, irrespective of
their positions within the kinetochore. This may be difficult to
achieve if the executioner phosphatase is a regulated one that
binds to a defined location within one protein. The final general
model is depicted in Figure 4C. The basic premise of this model is
that some cellular processes, such as the SAC, use kinases to
phosphorylate different spatially resolved substrates. When those
substrates must be synchronously dephosphorylated in a
regulated manner, then phosphatase regulation can extinguish
kinase activity at its point of origin, before basal phosphatase
activity dephosphorylates the substrates (when kinase activity falls

then fixed and stained as described below.
Immunofluorescence
Cells, plated on High Precision 1.5H 12-mm coverslips
(Marienfeld), were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS
for 10 min or pre-extracted (when using BUB1-pT609 or BUBR1pT620 antibodies and in double mutant experiments) with 0.1%

mM EGTA) for 1 minute before addition of 4% PFA for 10 minutes.
In experiments using calyculin A, coverslips were coated with polyL-lysine to prevent cell loss (Sigma-Aldrich). After fixation,
coverslips were washed with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS
+ 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min, incubated with primary antibodies

dark. Coverslips were then washed with PBS and mounted on glass
slides using ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). All
images were acquired on a DeltaVision Core or Elite system
equipped with a heated 37°C chamber, with a 100x/1.40 NA U Plan
S Apochromat objective using softWoRx software (Applied
precision). Images were acquired at 1x1 binning using a CoolSNAP
HQ or HQ2 camera (Photometrics) and processed using softWorx
software and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). For
experiments involving YFP-expressing cells, mitotic cells were
selected based on good expression of YFP at the kinetochore
(KNL1) or cytoplasm (BUBR1 cells). In cases were double mutants
(YFP and Turquoise 2) were used (Figure 1E), cells were selected
based on good YFP signal in the kinetochore and cytoplasm, since
the chicken anti-GFP antibody used cannot discriminate between
the two fluorescent proteins. All immunofluorescence images
displayed are maximum intensity projections of deconvolved
stacks and were chosen to most closely represent the mean
quantified data.

Gene knockdown
For all experiments in HeLa Flp-in cells, the endogenous mRNA was
knocked down and replaced with an siRNA-resistant mutant. The
siRNA’s
used
in
this
study
were:
BUBR1
(5′AGAUCCUGGCUAACUGUUC
-3’),
siBUB1
(5′GAAUGUAAGCGUUCACGAA -3’), B56α (PPP2R5A: 5’ UGAAUGAACUGGUUGAGUA
-3’),
B56β
(PPP2R5B:
5’GAACAAUGAGUAUAUCCUA
-3’),
B56γ
(PPP2R5C:
5’GGAAGAUGAACCAACGUUA
-3’),
B56δ
(PPP2R5D:
5’UGACUGAGCCGGUAAUUGU
-3’),
B56ε
(PPP2R5E:
5’GCACAGCUGGCAUAUUGUA
-3’),
PP1α
(PP1CA:
5’GUAGAAACCAUAGAUGCGG
-3’),
PP1β
(PP1CB:
5’ACAUCAGUAGGUCUCAUAA
-3’),
PP1γ
(PP1CC:
5’GCAUGAUUUGGAUCUUAUA -3’), GAPDH (control siRNA: 5′GUCAACGGAUUUGGUCGUA-3’). All siRNA’s were synthesised with
dTdT overhang by Sigma-Aldrich and used at 20nM final
concentration (i.e. the pools for B56 or PP1 knockdown contain
20nM of each siRNA). Double stranded interference RNA was used
to
knockdown
endogenous
KNL1
(sense:
5'GCAUGUAUCUCUUAAGGAAGAUGAA-3’;
antisense:
5'UUCAUCUUCCUUAAGAGAUACAUGCAU-3') (Integrated DNA
technologies) at a final concentration of 20 nM. All siRNAs/dsiRNAs
were transfected using Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX Transfection
Reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
After 16 h of knockdown, DNA synthesis was prevented by
addition of thymidine (2mM, Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h. Doxycycline
(1µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to induce expression of the
BUBR1, BUB1 and KNL1 constructs during and following the
thymidine block. Cells were then released from thymidine block
into media supplemented with doxycycline and nocodazole (3.3
µM, Sigma-Aldrich) for 8.5 hours before processing for fixed
analysis. In live-cell imaging experiments in Figure 2, MPS1 and/or
PLK1 were inhibited by adding AZ-3146 (2.5 µM Sigma-Aldrich) and
BI-2536 (100nM, Selleckbio) shortly prior to imaging (6-8h after
thymidine release). For MPS1 and PLK1 inhibition in cells analysed
by immunofluorescence, nocodazole and MG132 (10 µM, SigmaAldrich) were added first for 30 minutes (plus BI-2536 if pretreatment is used), followed by a time-course of AZ-3146 and/or
BI-2536 in media containing nocodazole and MG132.

Time-lapse analyses
For fluorescence time-lapse imaging, cells were imaged in 24-well
plates in DMEM (no phenol red) with a heated 37°C chamber in 5%
CO2. Images were taken every 4 minutes with a 20x /0.4 NA air
objective using a Zeiss Axio Observer 7 with a CMOS Orca flash 4.0
camera at 4x4 binning. For brightfield imaging, cells were imaged
in a 24-well plate in DMEM in a heated chamber (37°C and 5% CO2)
with a 10x/0.5 NA objective using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera
at 2x2 binning on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M, controlled by Micromanager software (open source: https://micro-manager.org/) or
with a 20x/0.4 NA air objective using a Zeiss Axio Observer 7 as
detailed above. Mitotic exit was defined by cells flattening down
in the presence of nocodazole and MPS1 inhibitor.

A high dose of calyculin A (50nM, LC labs) was used to inhibit all
PP1 and PP2A phosphatases (IC50 values, 1-2nM 30). In these
experiments (Figures 3E and S3I), Hela FRT cells (empty FRT locus)
were treated with nocodazole for 4 hours followed by a 30 min
incubation with media containing nocodazole and MG132 (these
two drugs were present in all the subsequent steps of these
experiments) prior to treatment as indicated in the timelines.

Antibodies
All antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA in PBS. The following primary
antibodies were used for immunofluorescence imaging (at the
final concentration indicated): chicken anti-GFP (ab13970 from
Abcam, 1:5000), guinea pig anti-Cenp-C (BT20278 from Caltag +
Medsystems, 1:5000), rabbit anti-BUB1 (A300-373A from Bethyl,
1:1000), mouse anti-BUBR1 (A300-373A from Millipore, 1:1000),
rabbit anti-PLK1 (IHC-00071 from Bethyl, 1:1000) and rabbit antiBUBR1 (A300-386A from Bethyl, 1:1000). The rabbit anti-pMELTKNL1 antibody is directed against Thr 943 and Thr 1155 of human
KNL1 16 (Gift from G.Kops, Hubrecht, NL). The rabbit anti-BUB1p609 antibody was raised against phospho-Thr 609 of human

To image nocodazole-arrested cells treated with siRNA targeting
BUBR1, BUB1 or both (Figures S1A-C), HeLa FRT cells were released
from thymidine block (40 h after siRNA treatment) for 7 hours
before arresting at the G2/M boundary with RO-3306 treatment
(10M, Tocris) for 2 hours. Cells were then washed three times
and incubated for 15 minutes with full growth media before
addition of MG132 for 30 minutes to prevent mitotic exit. This is

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
Flp-in HeLa cells were treated with thymidine and doxycycline for
24 hours, followed by a treatment with nocodazole and
doxycycline for 16 hours. Mitotic cells were isolated by mitotic
shake off and incubated with media containing nocodazole and
doxycycline with or without calyculin A (50nM, LC labs) for 20 min.
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
0.5% TritonX-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM ß-glycerophosphate, 25
mM NaF, 10 nM Calyculin A and complete protease inhibitor
containing EDTA (Roche)) on ice for 20 minutes. The lysate was
incubated with GFP-Trap magnetic beads (from ChromoTek) for 2
hr at 4°C on a rotating wheel in wash buffer (same as lysis Buffer,
but without TritonX-100) at a 3:2 ratio of wash buffer:lysate. The
beads were washed 3x with wash buffer and the sample was
eluted according to the protocol from ChromoTek.

Image quantification and statistical analysis
For quantification of kinetochore protein levels, images of similarly
stained experiments were acquired with identical illumination
settings and analysed using an ImageJ macro, as described
previously 51. Two-tailed, non-parametric Mann-Whitney unpaired
t-tests were performed to compare the means values between
experimental groups in immunofluorescence quantifications from
Figures 1 and S1 (using Prism 6 software). For Figure 2 onwards,
when multiple timepoints and treatments are used to compare the
difference in dephosphorylation kinetics, the graphs are plotted as
violin
plots
using
PlotsOfData
(https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotsOfData/; 52). This allows the
spread of data to be accurately visualised along with the 95%
confidence intervals (thick vertical bars) calculated around the
median (thin horizontal lines). to allow statistical comparison
between all treatments and timepoints. When the vertical bar of
one condition does not overlap with one in another condition the
difference between the medians is statistically significant (p<0.05).
