Abstract

18

Sport horses need to fulfill high physical and psychological requirements during training

19

and competition. These as well as certain conditions of modern husbandry may affect their

20

wellbeing. Here we aimed to (1) evaluate effects of demographic and management factors

21

as well as personality traits on stress reactivity of sport horses, (2) investigate if elite sport

22

horses have elevated stress levels compared to amateur sport horses, and (3) assess whether

23

different equestrian disciplines differentially influence horses' adrenal cortex

24

responsiveness. For this purpose, we visited 149 healthy elite (n=94) and amateur (n=54)

25

sport horses in Switzerland and performed an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)

26

stimulation test. Additionally, a person who was familiar with the horse completed a

27

questionnaire about demographic and management factors and horses’ personality traits.

28

Linear models were calculated to assess associations between the questionnaire data and

29

salivary cortisol 60 and 90 minutes after ACTH stimulation. While the model at T90 was

30

not significant, post-stimulatory cortisol after 60 min appears most informative in line with

31

a previous study and was significantly affected by the horses’ breed and by three

32

management factors: “number of riders”, “hours spent outside” and “group housing”

33

(adjusted r2 =15%, p<0.001). Thoroughbred and Warmblood horses displayed an increased

34

adrenal response compared to Franches-Montagnes horses. Horses with several riders had

35

a less pronounced reaction than horses with one rider, and horses that spent more time

36

outside had a decreased response compared to horses that were stabled most of the time.

37

Horses living in groups showed higher post-stimulatory cortisol values than horses that

38

were housed singly. However, no significant associations of cortisol responsiveness with

39

personality traits were found, and neither the horses' use as elite or as amateur sport horses

40

nor the discipline had an effect on the cortisol response. This suggests that optimizing

41

husbandry conditions may be more important for improving horses' welfare than changing

42

their use.

Introduction

45

As grazing animals living in herds [1, 2], their physical strength, speed and endurance

46

enabled horses (Equus caballus) to flee from predators and to search for food and water

47

over large distances in their original steppe environment [3]. Within human custody, these

48

naturally occurring talents predestined horses to become extraordinary athletes [3].

49

Furthermore, these features have even been enhanced through selective breeding for

50

competition purposes and training [4, 5]. However, modern keeping conditions often bear

51

little resemblance to the horse’s natural habitat and social structure and in many cases

52

allow only limited natural foraging behavior [1]. Sport horses, especially, are now mostly

53

housed in single stalls [6] and their time on pasture and the amount of roughage fed is

54

often restricted [7]. In equestrian sports, horses often complete high intensity trainings with

55

different trainers and riders, go to national and international horse shows, and are thus

56

often required to live in different stables and to travel long distances in trailers and

57

airplanes. As a consequence, modern sport horses are significantly challenged [8]. The

58

high requirements that they are expected to fulfill, as well as the conditions of modern

59

husbandry, may lead to significant stress, both acute and chronic.

60

Stress is the response of the body to a demand (stressor) placed upon it [9]. Whenever a

61

stimulus is perceived as a stressor, it results in a biological response in an attempt to cope

62

with the situation [10]. This biological reaction consists of the behavioral response, the

63

sympathetic-adrenal medulla (SAM) axis response and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal

64

cortex (HPA) axis response, which are often activated concurrently and interact during

65

stressful situations [11]. Studies investigating acute or chronic stress in horses have

66

assessed either one or several of these pathways [12-14]. SAM axis parameters, such as

67

evaluation of heart rate or heart rate variability and endocrinological parameters such as

68

cortisol levels are typically used as measures of acute stress [10]. HPA axis stimulation

69

tests such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)

70

challenge tests are described as potential tools for the assessment of long-lasting effects of

71

stress in horses [10]. Stimulated cortisol may give an impression of an animal’s overall

72

adrenal capacity, with both a depression [15-17] or an exaggerated response to stimulation

73

[18-21] reflecting a long-term stress-related alteration of the HPA axis.

74

Several management factors as well as personality traits have been investigated in relation

75

to stress responsivity in horses. For instance, a lack of social contact was linked to changes

76

in stress-related physiology and behavior [22, 23]. The examination of feeding patterns

77

revealed associations between stereotypies as indicators of chronic stress [10] and a

78

restriction of forage intake [24, 25] or pasture time [26-28]. Furthermore, participation in

79

equestrian competitions was demonstrated to cause an increased sympathoadrenal activity

80

and an activation of the HPA axis immediately after the event [29-31]. A few studies also

81

reported some associations between equine personality traits and stress parameters [32-34].

82

Cortisol responses following external stimulation of the HPA axis have been investigated

83

in behavioral studies [23, 35] and for the evaluation of chronic stress in horses suffering

84

from overtraining [36], stereotypies [18] or gastric disease [19, 20].

85

However, to what extent management factors, type of use or horses’ personality traits are

86

associated with indicators of long-term stress has not been investigated to date.

87

Using ACTH stimulation tests and questionnaire surveys, the aims of this study were to

88

explore (1) effects of breed, management factors and personality traits on the adrenal

89

reactivity of sport horses, (2) whether elite sport horses have elevated stress-levels in

90

comparison to amateur horses, and (3) if sport discipline is an influencing factor.

Experimental setup

115

The first author visited all horses in their “home stable” environment. Each horse

116

underwent an ACTH stimulation test, and a person who was familiar with the horse

117

(owner, rider or caretaker) completed a questionnaire. Horses did not participate in any

118

physical activity two hours before the visit, and they were not transported and did not

119

attend competitions during the preceding 48 hours. They received no medication or

120

additives except for over-the-counter nutritional supplements. Prior to the ACTH

121

stimulation test, the weight of the horses was estimated using an established formula for

122

mature horses, where weight (kg) = (heartgirth2 x body length)/ (11,880 cm3) [37]. The

123

general examination included an assessment of mucous membrane color, lymph nodes,

124

heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature at rest. Only horses in a good general

125

condition with normal general examination findings were included in the study. The body

126

condition score (BCS) was recorded, according to the 9-point Henneke BCS system

127

ranging from 1 (poor) to 9 (extremely fat) [38]. During the time of the test, horses

128

remained in their normal environment such as their stall or open stable. They were

129

prevented from drinking during the time of the test to avoid dilution of saliva before

130

cortisol measurements. For this reason, self-watering troughs were covered with plastic

131

bags.

132
133

ACTH stimulation test

134

For the ACTH stimulation test, based on the estimated weight, a dose of 1 µg/kg BW

135

synthetic ACTH1-24 (Synacthen tetracosactidum 0.25 mg/ml equivalent to 25 IU/mL;

136

Novartis, Vilvoorde, Belgium) was injected intravenously. The dosage was chosen based

137

on previous publications [19, 20, 39, 40]. Saliva samples were taken with salivettes

138

(Sarstedt, Nuembrecht, Germany) before (0 minute – baseline; T0) and 60 (T60) and 90

139

(T90) minutes after ACTH administration. The salivette swab was placed into the horse’s

140

mouth for at least 40 seconds until it was completely soaked with saliva. Afterwards, the

141

swab was replaced into the salivette and stored in a box with cool packs until return to the

142

clinic. Salivettes were then directly centrifuged at room temperature for 10 min at 185 x g

143

and stored at -20°C until the analysis. For the determination of salivary cortisol

144

concentrations, a competitive enzyme immunoassay (cELISA, Salimetrics, Newmarket,

145

United Kingdom) was used, which has been previously validated for use in horses [19, 20,

146

40].

147
148

Questionnaire

149

The first part of the questionnaire was designed to record information about demographic

150

and management factors such as housing, use and feeding, stereotypies and clinical signs

151

such as teeth grinding or yawning (Table 2). After termination of the study, some questions

152

were re-coded because there were too few observations in one of the categories (Table 2).

153

The aim of the second part of the questionnaire was to evaluate personality traits of the

154

participating horses. For this purpose, a previously validated questionnaire [41], relying on

155

the opinion of caretakers regarding the personality of horses, was adapted for the current

156

study (Table 3). The original version by Momozawa et al. [41] consisted of 20 items,

157

leading to four factors after a principal component analysis. These factors were labelled

158

'Anxiety', 'Trainability', 'Affability' and 'Gate Entrance'. For the current study, the question

159

about the horses' behavior at the starting gate (“gate entrance”) was excluded, since it is

160

only relevant for racehorses. Three additional questions regarding cooperation during

161

riding, trailer loading and transportation and four questions about the horses’ resilience

162

during or after putatively stressful events such as competitions or transports including [1]

163

recovery time; [2] susceptibility to infection (e.g. respiratory infections); [3] loss of

164

appetite; and [4] signs of discomfort (e.g. flehmen, colic, prolonged resting times) were

165

added instead. Questions of this second part of the questionnaire were answered using a

166

scale ranging from (1) poor to (9) excellent. To identify possible pitfalls or

167

misunderstandings, four independent volunteers/horse owners completed both parts of the

168

questionnaire. The questionnaire was adapted according to their comments, and German

169

and French translations were prepared for the participants. A person who was familiar with

170

the horse was asked to complete the questionnaires during the time the ACTH stimulation

171

test was performed.

190

Linear regression models (function lm) were calculated separately for the dependent

191

variables T60 and T90, with separate models for (1) demographic and management factors

192

and (2) personality traits, respectively. In the first model, 24 demographic and management

193

factors from the first part of the questionnaire (Table 2) in addition to the exact time of day

194

of the start of the ACTH stimulation test and the horse’s BCS were included as predictors.

195

In the second model, the seven principal components derived from the personality

196

questionnaire were used as explanatory variables. Initially, all variables were entered in the

197

models, which were then reduced by stepwise backward selection (function step). The fit

198

of the models was assessed using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), and the model

199

with the lowest AIC was retained as the final model. Level of significance was set at p <

200

0.05. Results were corrected for multiple testing via Bonferroni correction. In the Results

201

section, we report original p-values and subsequently indicate whether they can still be

202

considered significant after Bonferroni correction. The residuals of the models were

203

checked visually via scatterplots for independence and via quantile-quantile-plots,

204

histograms and Shapiro-Wilk tests for normal distribution. The models were tested for

205

homoscedasticity of variance via visual inspection and Breusch-Pagan test (package car,

206

function ncvTest). If necessary, square-root transformation of the respective response

207

variable was performed to meet linear model assumptions. Variables of the models were

208

checked for multicollinearity via use of the variance inflation factor (package car, function

209

vif). There was no multicollinearity in the variables included in the final models. 95%

210

confidence intervals and likelihood-ratio tests (LRT) were calculated for the final reduced

211

models.

215

For the comparison of adrenal reactivity in the ESHG versus the ASHG, the disciplines

216

para-equestrian, driving and vaulting were excluded, since no comparable groups of

217

amateur sport horses were available. Thus, 71 horses of the ESHG and all 54 horses of the

218

ASHG were included in the analysis. Linear regression models were computed to evaluate

219

the effect of category (ESHG versus ASHG) and the influence of the different disciplines

220

on cortisol levels after exogenous stimulation. As above, model assumptions were checked

221

and were adequate for all models.

227

Franches-Montagnes horses (n = 10) and one horse of another breed. Fifty-seven were

228

geldings, 33 mares and 5 stallions. Horses of the ASHG were 11 ± 3 (5 to 14) years old

and ‘docility’ were removed. Many horses did not have direct contact with other horses;

236

therefore, it was not possible to evaluate competitiveness. German and French translations

237

of docility turned out to be unsatisfactory and respondents were confused about the

238

meaning. The PCA on the remaining 24 items yielded seven cumulative factors with an

Eigenvalue > 1 accounting for 63.4% of the common variance. The factors partially

240

confirmed the factor structure determined for the original version of the questionnaire [41].

241

Factor 1 included five out of six items (nervousness, excitability, panic, skittishness,

242

timidity) that were grouped as “anxiety” by Momozawa et al. [41]. In the present study, it

243

contained two additional items (concentration, perseverance). Factor 2 (“trainability”),

244

consisted of two (trainability, memory) out of four items grouped by Momozawa et al. and

245

of two additional items (stubbornness, cooperation during riding). Factor 3 consisted of

246

four items that were not part of the original questionnaire and was named “recovery”

247

(recovery time after efforts, infections after efforts, inappetence after efforts and

248

discomfort after efforts). Factor 4, “social interaction” and factor 5, “alertness”, did not

249

form part of the factors identified by Momozawa et al. Factor 4 consisted of “self-

250

reliance”, “friendliness towards horses” and “discomfort after efforts” and factor 5 of

251

“concentration”, “curiosity” and “vigilance”. In agreement with Momozawa et al., Factor 6

252

was labeled "affability". It consisted of two (friendliness towards people, cooperation

253

while taking care) out of the four items that were grouped in the original questionnaire and

254

of one further item (inconsistent emotionality). The newly defined factor 7,

255

“transportability”, consisted of the newly added questions "cooperation trailer loading" and

256

"cooperation transport" (Table 3 and Fig 1).

Evaluation of the effects of demographic and management

275

factors as well as personality traits on stimulated cortisol levels

276

The final reduced linear regression model evaluating the effect of demographic and

277

management factors on cortisol levels 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation was significant

278

after Bonferroni correction (T60: p < 0.001; Adjusted R2 = 15%; F1, 122 = 3.305).

279

Likelihood ratio tests revealed four variables with a significant effect: 'breed' (LRT: p =

280

0.02), 'number of riders' (LRT: p = 0.009), 'hours spent outside' (LRT: p = 0.002) and

281

'group housing' (LRT: p = 0.045) (Table 4). Regarding 'breed', positive parameter estimates

282

for Warmblood and Thoroughbred horses indicate higher post-stimulatory cortisol values

283

in these breeds compared to Franches-Montages horses that served as the reference in the

284

model. Regarding the 'number of riders', horses with one rider displayed higher post-

285

stimulation cortisol values than horses with two or more riders. Furthermore, horses that

286

spent more time outside of their stalls on pasture or for training showed lower values than

287

horses being less outside. Predicted values for cortisol 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation

288

are plotted for the predictors 'breed', 'number of riders', 'hours spent outside', and 'group

289

housing' in Fig 2.

290

The linear regression model evaluating demographic and management factors influencing

291

cortisol levels 90 minutes after ACTH stimulation (Table 4) was not significant (T90: p =

292

0.085; Adjusted R2 = 4%; F1, 122 = 1.897).

293

When considering the correction for multiple testing, none of the personality traits was

294

significantly associated with post-stimulatory cortisol at either 60 or 90 minutes (T60: p =

295

0.043, adjusted R2 = 2%; F1, 122 = 4.181; T90: p = 0.013, adjusted R2 = 4%, F1, 122 = 6.35))

Evaluation of the effect of competition level and discipline on

322

stimulated cortisol levels

323

There was no significant effect of the category (ESHG or ASHG) on cortisol values after

324

ACTH stimulation (T60: p = 0.819; adjusted R2 = -0.008; F1, 123 = 0.05 and T90: p = 0.721;

325

adjusted R2 = -0.007; F1, 123 = 0.13). Likewise, cortisol levels at T60 (p = 0.753; adjusted

326

R2 = -0.02; F7, 117 = 0.6) and T90 (p = 0.055; adjusted R2 = 0.06; F7, 117 = 2.05) did not

327

differ between horses of different disciplines.

328
329

Discussion

330

This study found that 'breed', 'number of riders', 'hours spent outside' and 'group housing'

331

are significantly related to salivary cortisol concentrations in horses 60 minutes after

332

ACTH stimulation, which is considered as a measure of long-term effects of stress [10].

333

There was, however, no difference in post-stimulatory cortisol levels between elite sport

334

horses and amateur sport horses, nor between horses of different disciplines. Furthermore,

335

personality traits were unrelated to horses’ cortisol responsiveness.

336

Notably, 60 minutes post-stimulation appeared to be the most informative time point, as

337

linear regression models evaluating cortisol concentrations after 90 minutes showed no

338

significant outcome. This is in agreement with our previous study [43], where sampling

339

after 60 minutes also revealed the best association with the occurrence of glandular gastric

340

disease. The present study supports our previous hypothesis [43] that predominantly the

341

initial increase of cortisol after ACTH stimulation is important for the evaluation of the

342

cortisol responsiveness in the context of stress-related disorders.

343

Thoroughbreds and Warmbloods displayed an increased adrenal response in comparison to

344

Franches-Montagnes horses. This is in line with a previous study of our group, finding a
19

345

lower response to ACTH in Franches-Montagnes horses compared to Warmblood horses

346

[40]. In this previous study, however, all Franches-Montagnes horses were stallions and so

347

it was not possible to differentiate whether the effect was due to the sex or the breed of the

348

horses. The present study investigated the potential effects of sex and breed as separate

349

explanatory variables, indicating that the breed (but not sex) might be influencing equine

350

adrenal reactivity. This suggests a possible underlying genetic effect of adrenal reactivity

351

to ACTH stimulation – but note that the sample size for the Franches-Montagnes horses

352

was small at n=12, and 10 of these were driving horses trained by only three different

353

trainers. Thus, results need to be interpreted with caution, and further confirmatory studies

354

are needed.

355

Concerning the 'number of riders', interestingly, horses with two, three or more riders had a

356

less pronounced adrenal response than horses with only one rider. Conceivably, horses that

357

are accustomed to higher levels of stimulation in everyday life may be better equipped to

358

deal with challenging situations [44-46]. In accordance, horses that spent more time

359

outside of their stalls on pasture or for training and competition had a decreased reaction to

360

exogenous ACTH. This is in accordance with previous studies indicating better welfare in

361

pastured horses compared to stalled horses [6, 28, 47], possibly because the possibility to

362

range outside more closely reflects the horse’s natural living conditions [6, 48].

363

'Group housing' was another variable that significantly influenced post-stimulatory cortisol

364

concentrations. Horses living full-time in groups and horses living in groups on pasture

365

showed higher post-stimulatory cortisol values than single housed horses. Contradictory

366

results have been reported in previous studies investigating stress levels of domestic horses

367

in different types of housing. One study found that horses living in single housing without

368

physical contact to other horses had higher fecal glucocorticoids compared to horses with

369

visual, auditory and tactile contact to other horses and horses living in groups of two or

370

more individuals [22]. The authors concluded that integrating social contact into the

371

housing of the horse improves equine welfare [22]. Other studies found no effect of the

372

type of housing, neither in baseline salivary cortisol concentrations in adult horses [49] nor

373

in fecal glucocorticoid metabolites and baseline salivary cortisol in young horses stabled

374

for the first time [50, 51]. Similar to the results of the present study, Visser et al. [23] found

375

lower cortisol concentrations in response to a CRH stimulation test in individually housed

376

horses. In contrast to our interpretation, however, they proposed a decreased, not an

377

increased response as a potential sign for chronic stress. In line with the analysis of the

378

other variables in the present study, we conclude that group housing might represent a

379

further stressor activating the HPA axis. Although group housing appears overall to have

380

beneficial effects on horse welfare, it is also associated with social challenges [52], which

381

might be reflected by the increased cortisol reactivity of group housed horses in the present

382

study. In this context, social stability of groups might be important to consider in future

383

studies, which itself may be influenced by many factors such as group size, age and sex

384

composition, frequencies of changes or feeding management, available space and

385

infrastructure.

386
387

Regarding personality, the present study could confirm the overall factor structure of the

388

original questionnaire by Momozawa and colleagues [41] to some extent, although it

389

yielded some additional factors and some differences in loadings of individual items. Some

390

differences in factor structure are expectable given that firstly the study population was

391

more varied than in Momozawa et al., where only racehorses were investigated, secondly

392

not all questions were identical (two questions from the original version were removed and

393

four questions added), and thirdly German and French translations of the questionnaire

394

were used. Still, the similarity with the corresponding factors in Momozawa et al. indicates

395

validity of the questionnaire. Nevertheless, the analysis revealed no significant associations

396

between the cortisol response to ACTH and personality factors. Previous studies

397

investigating associations between HPA axis function and personality traits in horses

398

yielded diverse results. In line with our results, no correlations were found between

399

temperament and basal serum cortisol values of horses used in therapeutic riding programs

400

[53]. Another study investigated acute stress in stallions during transportation and found

401

that calmer and more experienced stallions had a more pronounced increase in plasma

402

cortisol following road transport than inexperienced, nervous stallions [54]. The authors

403

concluded that lower cortisol concentrations in the latter group might represent a failure of

404

the HPA axis to adapt to stress perceived during transportation [54]. As these examples

405

demonstrate for horses, the evidence for associations between HPA axis function and

406

personality has been inconclusive also in our own species [55] where both increased [33]

407

and decreased cortisol concentrations [54] have been interpreted as signs of disturbed HPA

408

function. Further research is needed in order to gain more specific insights into possible

409

relations between HPA axis function and equine behavior.

410

The current study was the first study to compare stress of high-performance athletes with

411

amateur sport horses and found no difference in post-stimulatory cortisol levels between

412

the two groups. However, studies investigating acute stress in relation to training [56-58]

413

and competition [29, 30] showed that experienced horses had lower basal plasma cortisol

414

values than inexperienced horses [56]. Furthermore, horses with a superior physical

415

training level had decreased basal cortisol levels, indicating that trained horses experience

416

less stress during exercise than untrained horses [56-58]. Consequently, the increased

417

requirements and the elevated stress levels that elite sport horses encounter may be

418

compensated by their experience and their better fitness. This may be the reason why

419

measurable indicators of long-term stress, such as cortisol responsiveness to external

420

stimulation do not differ between elite and amateur sport horses. Overtraining, however,

421

defined as a depletion of performance capacity, was revealed to lead to deleterious

422

consequences including weight loss, behavioral changes and reluctance to exercise [59]. It

423

was also reported to be associated with lower baseline cortisol values [36] and – quite

424

contradictory – with an increased [60], decreased [61] or unchanged [36] adrenal response

425

to exogenous ACTH. Interestingly, Bruin et al. [60] reported an increased response in

426

horses with early stages of overtraining, whereas Persson et al. [61] found a decreased

427

response in horses that were progressively and severely affected.

428

In comparison to these previous investigations, the present study tried to evaluate and

429

compare the overall adrenal capacity of the sport horse in a normal environment without

430

external stimuli such as training or transportation. Our results indicate that elite

431

performance levels do not lead to increased adrenal cortex responsiveness to ACTH. We

432

cannot specify, though, if this effect reflects targeted selection of horses that are able to

433

withstand the enhanced requirements in high-performance competitions. Also, with respect

434

to the effect of discipline, we found no difference in adrenal cortex reactivity between

435

horses used for dressage, show jumping, eventing or endurance. While two previous

436

studies reported increased cortisol levels in dressage horses [56, 62] compared to horses of

437

other disciplines in a competition environment, our results indicate no long-term effect of

438

discipline on HPA axis responsiveness.

439
440

A central limitation of this and similar studies remains the uncertain interpretation of the

441

results of ACTH stimulation tests. While a decreased response has usually been interpreted

442

as a sign of chronic stress in horses through desensitization of the HPA axis [23, 35, 61] (in

443

its extreme form an Addison crisis), various studies demonstrate an increased response in

444

potentially stressed horses [18-20, 22, 60]. Irrespective of these fundamental questions, a

445

blunted response, typically described in the context of severe distress [63], was not

446

expected in horses of the present study. At the time the study was conducted, all

447

participating animals successfully took part in competitions and were in good health.

448

Therefore, we hypothesized that increased responses might indicate higher stress

449

responsiveness.

450

A further difficulty for the interpretation of the results is the use of an immunoassay for the

451

measurement of cortisol concentrations in equine saliva. As shown for humans [64] and

452

only recently for use in horses [65], cortisol results derived from immunoassays need to be

453

interpreted with caution. While baseline values lack specificity, stimulated cortisol

454

concentrations might be overestimated [65]. However, an evaluation of overall effects, at a

455

group level rather than at an individual level, should still be reliable. Consequently, only

456

stimulated cortisol concentrations were considered for the analysis of the present study.

457

Previous studies described seasonal variability and a diurnal rhythm within cortisol

458

concentrations [49, 66, 67]. Due to the need to adjust to horse owners’ and riders’

459

schedules, it was not possible to collect samples at the same time of the day or within only

460

one season. However, baseline cortisol values, which are the most likely to be affected by

461

natural occurring release patterns, were not analyzed here. Cortisol releases induced by

462

exogenous ACTH administration are expected to override diurnal or seasonal changes [68],

463

and we statistically controlled for this effect by including time of day as a predictor in the

464

models. This confirmed that time of day had no significant effect on the post-stimulatory

465

salivary cortisol levels reported here.

466
467

In conclusion, from the current data, there is no evidence that the superior performance and

468

the high demands that elite sport horses have to fulfill in comparison to amateur sport

469

horses have long-term adverse consequences on their welfare as determined by their

470

cortisol reactivity. However, breed and management parameters, such as number of riders,

471

time spent outside and housing, influence the amount of stress hormones released.

472

Therefore, our results suggest that optimizing husbandry conditions, rather than changing

473

performance level, may be more important for improving the welfare of horses.
