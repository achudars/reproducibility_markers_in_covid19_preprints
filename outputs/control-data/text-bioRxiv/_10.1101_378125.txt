Abstract

24	  

Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS) affects Crassostrea gigas oysters worldwide and

25	  

caused important economic losses. Disease dynamics was recently deciphered and revealed a

26	  

multiple and progressive infection caused by the Ostreid herpesvirus OsHV-1 µVar,

27	  

triggering an immunosuppression followed by microbiota destabilization and bacteraemia by

28	  

opportunistic bacterial pathogens. However, it remains unknown if microbiota might

29	  

participate to oyster protection to POMS, and if microbiota characteristics might be predictive

30	  

of oyster mortalities. To tackle this issue, we transferred full-sib progenies of resistant and

31	  

susceptible oyster families from hatchery to the field during a period in favour of POMS.

32	  

After five days of transplantation, oysters from each family were either sampled for

33	  

individual microbiota analyses using 16S rRNA gene-metabarcoding or transferred into

34	  

facilities to record their survival using controlled condition. As expected, all oysters from

35	  

susceptible families died, and all oysters from the resistant family survived. Quantification of

36	  

OsHV-1 and bacteria showed that five days of transplantation was long enough to

37	  

contaminate oysters by POMS, but not for entering the pathogenesis process. Thus, it was

38	  

possible to compare microbiota characteristics between resistant and susceptible oyster

39	  

families at the early steps of infection. Strikingly, we found that microbiota evenness and

40	  

abundances

41	  

Rhodobacteraceae, and Rhodospirillaceae were significantly different between resistant and

42	  

susceptible oyster families. We concluded that these microbiota characteristics might predict

43	  

oyster mortalities.

Introduction

45	  

The farmed oyster Crassostrea gigas is heavily affected by the Pacific Oyster Mortality

46	  

Syndrome (POMS) targeting juveniles (Barbosa Solomieu et al., 2015; Pernet et al., 2016).

47	  

This disease is multifactorial and depends on water temperature (Petton et al., 2015),	  

48	  

development stage (Azéma et al., 2017), and oyster diet (Pernet et al., 2019). It is also

49	  

polymicrobial due to the combined development of viral and bacterial infections (de Lorgeril

50	  

et al., 2018). Different susceptibility levels were previously associated with oyster

51	  

physiological status, genetic backgrounds (Dégremont et al., 2005; Samain et al., 2007;

52	  

Wendling et al., 2017), in association with microbiota dysbiosis (Lokmer and Wegner, 2015).

53	  

Recently, holistic molecular approaches revealed the mechanism of POMS (de Lorgeril et al.,

54	  

2018; Rubio et al., 2019). These studies showed that an infection by the Ostreid herpesvirus

55	  

(OsHV-1 µVar) is the critical step in the infectious process leading to an immune-

56	  

compromised state by altering hemocyte physiology. This first process is followed by a

57	  

microbiota destabilization which “opens the door” to bacterial pathogens (e.g., vibrios) that

58	  

target hemocytes to induce their lysis. The infectious process is completed with subsequent

59	  

bacteraemia, which is the ultimate step inducing oyster death.

60	  

So far, it is still unknown whether oyster microbial associates might influence disease

61	  

development, and if microbiota characteristics might predict oyster mortalities. However,

62	  

microbiota can play a role of physical barriers against pathogens. For example, it was

63	  

suggested that part of the resident hemolymph bacteria may contribute to oyster protection by

64	  

producing antimicrobial peptides (Desriac et al., 2014). Other studies highlighted protective

65	  

effects of (i) secondary endosymbiont of aphids against parasitoid wasps (Oliver et al., 2003),

66	  

(ii) toxic alkaloids produced by endophytic fungi of grasses against herbivores (Clay, 1990),

67	  

or (iii) symbiotic bacteria of frogs against pathogenic fungi (Woodhams et al., 2007).

68	  

Furthermore, microbial associates might also stimulate immunity of their hosts (Wang et al.,

69	  

2019), and thus indirectly limit pathogen development.

70	  

To tackle this issue, we used one resistant oyster family (RF21) and two susceptible families

71	  

(SF15 and SF32) used in a previous study (de Lorgeril et al., 2018). Pathogen-free oysters

72	  

(reproduced and grown in bio-secured conditions) from these three full-sib families were

73	  

placed for five days in the field during an infectious period (Figure 1). According to previous

74	  

observations, 16°C was a relevant threshold to define the infectious period, as high mortality

75	  

rates were observed above this temperature (Pernet et al., 2012; Petton et al., 2013;

76	  

Dégremont et al., 2015). Moreover, five days were considered sufficient for oyster

77	  

contamination by the causal agents of the disease (Petton et al., 2015), and allow microbiota

78	  

analyses before disease development and animal death. In both the hatchery (control) and

79	  

after five days of transplantation in the field, oysters were sampled, and we analyzed oyster-

80	  

associated bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene-metabarcoding.

81	  

This study aimed at comparing bacteria content of resistant and susceptible families in order

82	  

to possibly identify microbiota features associated with oyster mortality and/or resistance.

83	  

According to a previous holistic study (de Lorgeril et al., 2018), we expected that susceptible

84	  

families had (i) early microbiota destabilization (increase of species richness, decrease of

85	  

evenness, increase of microbiota dispersions), and (ii) possibly contained opportunistic and/or

86	  

pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio sp., Arcobacter sp., etc.).

Materials and Methods

88	  

Full-sib C. gigas oyster families

89	  

In 2015, full-sib C. gigas oyster families were produced using a methodology that allowed the

90	  

production of pathogen-free juveniles (de Lorgeril et al., 2018). Two oyster families (SF15 and

91	  

SF32) were produced using one female and one male sampled from wild populations in the

92	  

Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, respectively (Figure 1). In addition, family RF21

93	  

was produced using genitors from a mass selective breeding program aiming to increase the

94	  

resistance of C. gigas oysters against OsHV-1. It was performed by breeding disease

95	  

survivors throughout four generations of selection (Dégremont et al., 2015). Thus, each

96	  

family (cohort) corresponded to the offspring of a biparental reproduction (full-sib progenies).

97	  

Conditionning, reproduction and larval breeding were performed as described previously (de

98	  

Lorgeril et al., 2018). At the larval and post-larval stages, oysters were fed with the same diet

99	  

as the genitors at a concentration between 1500-2000 µm3 µl−1 (Rico-Villa et al., 2009).

100	  

Before experiments, all oyster families were maintained in controlled condition at the

101	  

laboratory (Argenton, France) using seawater treated with UV, filtered through 1 µm mesh,

102	  

and enriched with a bi-specific phytoplankton diet made of Tisochrysis lutea (CCAP 927/14)

103	  

and Chaetoceros muelleri (CCAP 1010/3) (in equal biomass proportion) at a ratio equivalent

104	  

to 6% of the oyster dry mass (Rico-Villa et al., 2009). Finally, all oysters remained free of any

105	  

abnormal mortality.

106	  

Experimental design

107	  

About 140 juveniles per oyster family were either kept in the controlled condition or placed in

108	  

the field for five days. The field site was located within a oyster farm in the Atlantic Ocean

109	  

during an infectious period (Figure 1). This infectious period was selected according to

110	  

seawater temperatures (above 16°C), and was confirmed by the observed mortality rates.

111	  

After five days of transplantation (July 2016), no mortality occurred and 14 individuals per

112	  

family were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. The remaining oysters were

113	  

then transferred into the hatchery under controlled conditions to monitor the survival rates of

114	  

the three families. The number of dead oysters was recorded at day 13 (i.e., eight days after

115	  

the end of transplantation). Similarly, 14 individuals per family (except 13 for SF32) kept in

116	  

the controlled condition were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.

118	  

DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing

119	  

Frozen oysters were ground in liquid nitrogen in 50 ml stainless steel bowls using 20 mm

120	  

diameter grinding balls (Retsch MM400 mill). The powders were stored at -80°C, and were

121	  

then used for DNA extractions using the DNA from tissue Macherey-Nagel kit (reference

122	  

740952.250) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In order to improve DNA extractions,

123	  

we added a crushing step, which consisted in an additional 12 minutes mechanical lysis using

124	  

zirconium beads before the 90 min enzymatic lysis in the presence of proteinase K. DNA

125	  

concentration and quality were checked with Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek

126	  

Instruments, Inc.).

127	  

Then, the 16S rRNA gene of bacterial communities was amplified and sequenced using the

128	  

variable

129	  

GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3’) (Klindworth et al., 2013). Paired-end sequencing

130	  

(250 bp read length) was performed at the McGill University (Génome Québec Innovation

131	  

Centre, Montréal, Canada) on the MiSeq system (Illumina) using the v2 chemistry according

132	  

to the manufacturer’s protocol. Raw sequence data are available in the SRA database

133	  

(BioProject ID PRJNA419907).

134	  

Quantification of bacteria and OsHV-1

135	  

Quantification of OsHV-1, total bacteria 16S rDNA, and total Vibrio 16S rDNA was

136	  

performed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). All amplification reactions were analysed using a

137	  

Roche LightCycler 480 Real-Time thermocycler (qPHD-Montpellier GenomiX platform,

138	  

Montpellier University, France). A Labcyte Acoustic Automated Liquid Handling Platform

139	  

(ECHO) was used for pipetting into the 384-well plate (Roche). The total qPCR reaction

140	  

volume was 1.5 µl and consisted of 0.5 µl DNA (40 ng µl−1) and 1 µl LightCycler 480 SYBR

141	  

Green I Master mix (Roche) containing 0.5 µM PCR primer (Eurogenetec SA). Virus-specific

142

denaturation (95 °C, 10 s), hybridization (60 °C, 20 s) and elongation (72 °C, 25 s). After

151	  

these PCR cycles a melting temperature curve of the amplicon was generated to verify the

152	  

specificity of the amplification. Absolute quantification of OsHV-1 copies was calculated by

153	  

comparing the observed Cq values to a standard curve generated from the DNA polymerase

154	  

catalytic subunit amplification product cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector. For total bacteria

155	  

and total Vibrio 16S rDNA, we used the relative quantification calculated by the 2−ΔΔCq

156	  

method (Pfaffl, 2001) with the mean of the measured threshold cycle values of two reference

157	  

genes (Cg-BPI, GenBank: AY165040, Cg-BPI F-ACGGTACAGAACGGATCTACG, Cg-

160	  

Sequence analyses

161	  

The FROGS pipeline (Find Rapidly OTU with Galaxy Solution) implemented into a galaxy

162	  

instance (http://sigenae-workbench.toulouse.inra.fr/galaxy/) was used to define Operational

163	  

Taxonomic Units (OTU), and computed taxonomic affiliations (Escudié et al., 2017). Briefly,

164	  

paired reads were merged using FLASH (Magoc and Salzberg, 2011). After denoising and

165	  

primer/adapters removal with cutadapt (Martin, 2011), de novo clustering was performed

166	  

using SWARM that uses a local clustering threshold, with aggregation distance d=3 (Mahé et

167	  

al., 2015). Chimera were removed using VSEARCH (de novo chimera detection) (Rognes et

168	  

al., 2016). Particularly, this method divided each sequence into four fragments, and then

169	  

looked for similarity with putative parents in the whole set of OTUs. We filtered the dataset

170	  

for singletons and we annotated OTUs using Blast+ against the Silva database (release 123,

171	  

September 2015) to produce an OTU and affiliation table in standard BIOM format.

172	  

Rarefaction curves of species richness were produced using the {phyloseq} R package, and

173	  

the ggrare function (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). In order to compare samples for alpha and

174	  

beta diversity, we used the rarefy_even_depth function to subsample dataset to 5148 reads per

175	  

sample excluding chloroplasts. The alpha diversity metrics (Chao1 and Shannon) were

176	  

estimated at the OTU level with the estimate_richness function. Moreover, Pielou’s measure

177	  

of species evenness was computed using the diversity function in {vegan}. We also used

178	  

phyloseq to obtain abundances at differents taxonomic ranks (for genus and family)

179	  

(tax_glom function). Because agglomerate of multi-affiliation and unknown taxa does not

180	  

make sense at higher taxonomic ranks, we only kept taxa having a true annotation for each

181	  

corresponding taxonomic rank. We computed Bray-Curtis dissimilarities to study beta

182	  

diversity, i.e., distances between samples for OTU compositions (vegdist function, {vegan}).

183	  

Statistical and multivariate analyses

184	  

All statistical analyses were done using R v3.3.1 (R: a language and environment for

185	  

statistical computing, 2008; R Development Core Team, R Foundation for Statistical

186	  

Computing, Vienna, Austria [http://www.R-project.org]).

187	  

Principal coordinate analyses (pcoa, {vegan}) were computed to describe compositions of

188	  

microbial communities between samples using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities (vegdist, {vegan}).

189	  

Multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions was tested between microbial assemblages of

190	  

resistant and susceptible oyster families using 999 permutations (permutest, {vegan}). We

191	  

used DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) (DESeq {DESeq2}) to identify OTUs having differential

192	  

abundances between resistant and susceptible oyster families. Heatmaps of significant

193	  

bacterial genera and families were computed using relative abundances and the heatmap.2

194	  

function ({gplots}).

195	  

We performed one-way ANOVA or non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests (when normality of

196	  

residuals was rejected (Shapiro test)) to compare alpha diversity metrics of microbiota. When

197	  

ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis tests were significant, we then computed pairwise comparisons

198	  

between group levels (post-hoc analyses) using pairwise-t-tests or Dunn tests, respectively.

199	  

For all analyses, the threshold significance level was set at 0.05. P-values were corrected for

200	  

multiple comparisons using Benjamini and Hochberg’s method (Benjamini and Hochberg,

201	  

1995) (p.adjust, {stats}).

Results

203	  

Survival rates and disease development

204	  

Full-sib progenies from one resistant (RF21) and two susceptible (SF15 and SF32) oyster families

205	  

were produced and reared in bio-secured conditions (Argenton hatchery, France). About 140

206	  

pathogen-free oysters per family were transferred to the infectious environment for five days

207	  

(Brest, Atlantic Ocean, temperature above 16°C) (Figure 1). Fourteen oysters per family were

208	  

then flash frozen for individual bacterial microbiota analyses. The other 126 oysters per

209	  

family were placed back in hatchery to monitor survival rates. As expected, all oysters from

210	  

the two susceptible families died, whereas all oysters from the resistant family survived

211	  

(Figure 1). This observation showed that oysters were contaminated during transplantation,

212	  

and then developed the disease. Quantification of OsHV-1 and bacteria at day 5 post-

213	  

transplantation showed that only three oysters from susceptible families displayed moderate

214	  

to important viral infection, and that only one individual displayed both high viral infection

215	  

and bacteraemia (Figure 2). These results suggested that five days of transplantation in the

216	  

field during an infectious period were long enough for oyster contamination, but not for

217	  

entering the pathogenesis process (except for three oysters).

218	  

The whole bacterial communities were sequenced using the 16S rRNA gene from 14 oysters

219	  

per family and per condition (except 13 oysters for SF32 in hatchery) (i.e., 83 oyster-associated

220	  

microbiota for control and infectious conditions). In average, each sample contained 21423

221	  

sequences representing 1075 OTUs (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

222	  

First, we searched for known opportunistic genera within microbiota of diseased oysters (de

223	  

Lorgeril et al., 2018). Nine out of ten previously identified genera were present in our dataset

224	  

(Figure 3). Most were abundant for the oyster highly infected by OsHV-1 and displaying

225	  

bacteraemia (SF15.S.R14) (Figures 2 and 3A). Both Vibrio and Psychromonas genera were

226	  

found within the three diseased oysters (Figure 3A). However, Vibrio occurred in the majority

227	  

of healthy individuals as well (Figure 3B).

228	  

Microbiota assemblages before diseased development

229	  

Although five days of transplantation were long enough for oyster contamination, only three

230	  

individuals entered the pathogenesis process as indicated by virus load. Thus, after discarding

231	  

these three individuals, it was possible to compare microbiota characteristics of the other

232	  

oysters between resistant and susceptible families before the onset of disease development.

233	  

First, we compared alpha diversity indices (Chao1, evenness and Shannon) between oyster

234	  

families (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 3). This analysis showed that Chao1 increased

235	  

for all families between hatchery and the infectious environment. Moreover, evenness and

236	  

Shannon indices increased only for the resistant family RF21. Notably, RF21 had higher

237	  

evenness than SF15 and SF32 during the infectious condition. Secondly, we computed a

238	  

principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarities to describe

239	  

microbiota compositions (Figure 5A). This ordination highlighted that oyster microbiota

240	  

changed between hatchery and the infectious environment for the three oyster families.

241	  

Unexpectedly, microbiota dispersion of RF21 was not lower than the susceptible families, and

242	  

even showed higher dispersions for the infectious condition than in hatchery (Figure 5B).

243	  

Altogether, these results suggested that microbiota assemblages highly changed between

244	  

hatchery and the infectious environment for the three families. Although we did not expect to

245	  

find higher microbiota dispersion for RF21, our analyses revealed that the resistant family had

246	  

higher evenness than the susceptible families before the onset of disease development.

247	  

Different bacteria between oyster families in hatchery and infectious environment

248	  

Because resistant and susceptible oyster families had different microbiota characteristics

249	  

(evenness and dispersion) at the early steps of infection, we compared abundances of bacterial

250	  

taxa within hatchery to identify putative pathogens, opportunists or mutualists that were

251	  

consistently presents in microbiota before transplantation. Abundances were compared at two

252	  

taxonomic ranks, bacterial genera (Supplementary Table 4) and families (Supplementary

253	  

Table 5). Two genera (Colwellia and Photobacterium) (Supplementary Figure 2) and four

254	  

families (Anaplasmataceae, Colwelliaceae, Mycoplasmataceae, and Vibrionaceae) (Figure 6)

255	  

showed high abundances (>4% in at least one sample) and were significantly different

256	  

between resistant and susceptible oyster families.

257	  

We also compared bacterial taxa before disease development between resistant and

258	  

susceptible oyster families that were placed in the infectious environment. Except for

259	  

Mycoplasmataceae, significant bacterial taxa were not similar to hatchery-identified

260	  

candidates (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure 3). Four genera (Phormidium, Pseudomonas,

261

Discussion

267	  

Five days of transplantation allowed oyster contamination, but not disease development

268	  

Oysters were transplanted for five days in the field during an infectious period. According to

269	  

previous observations (Dégremont, 2011; Petton et al., 2015), this time period was considered

270	  

sufficient for oyster contamination. We did not observed dead oysters when they were

271	  

sampled, but all individuals of susceptible families died eight days after they were placed

272	  

back to laboratory tanks. This observation showed that oysters were contaminated during

273	  

transplantation, and this exposure was sufficient for the further development of the complete

274	  

pathogenesis process.

275	  

High abundances of OsHV-1 and total bacteria were previously observed for a susceptible

276	  

family during disease development (de Lorgeril et al., 2018). In this study, most oysters

277	  

(except three) did not exhibit high abundances of OsHV-1 or bacteria after five days of

278	  

transplantation. As a consequence and after exclusion of these three oysters, we thus analysed

279	  

oyster microbiota before the onset of disease development (i.e., at the early steps of infection).

280	  

Microbiota evenness was linked to oyster resistance during transplantation

281	  

According to a previous study (de Lorgeril et al., 2018), we expected to observe many

282	  

modifications of microbiota for susceptible oyster families during transplantation, but not or

283	  

few for the resistant one. In particular, we expected increase of alpha diversity indices (Chao1

284	  

and Shannon), and of microbiota dispersion for the susceptible families. Furthermore, we

285	  

hypothesized that the resistant family might have stable microbiota, because this characteristic

286	  

was linked to host homeostasis in many studies (Faith et al., 2013; Rungrassamee et al., 2016;

287	  

Zaneveld et al., 2017).

288	  

Unexpectedly, we found that alpha diversity indices and dispersion of microbiota highly

289	  

changed for the three oyster families (susceptible as well as resistant) when they were

290	  

transferred from hatchery to the infectious environment. Microbiota evenness was the only

291	  

index that discriminated resistant and susceptible families. It highlighted that OTU

292	  

abundances within resistant oysters were more equally distributed than within susceptible

293	  

oysters. This index may possibly have important effects on oyster homeostasis, because it was

294	  

already found to be positively linked to ecosystem productivity (Wilsey and Potvin, 2000;

295	  

Zhang et al., 2012), functional stability (Balvanera et al., 2005; Wittebolle et al., 2009), and

296	  

invasion resistance (Wilsey and Polley, 2002; De Roy et al., 2013).

297	  

Putative opportunistic and/or pathogenic bacteria of susceptible oysters

298	  

To date, most C. gigas diseases affecting juveniles in Europe were associated with

299	  

herpesvirus (OsHV-1 µVar) and Vibrio strains (Labreuche et al., 2006; Garcia et al., 2011;

300	  

Travers et al., 2014; Batista et al., 2015; Petton et al., 2015). Furthermore, other studies

301	  

highlighted the role of Roseovarius crassostreae (Boettcher, 2005; Maloy et al., 2007),

302	  

Tenacibaculum soleae (Burioli et al., 2017), and possibly Chlamydiales (Renault and

303	  

Cochennec, 1995) and Arcobacter sp. (Lokmer and Wegner, 2015; Burioli et al., 2017). Other

304	  

potential opportunistic bacteria were recently identified (de Lorgeril et al., 2018), such as

305	  

Cryomorphaceae,

306	  

Psychrobium, Psychromonas, and Salinirepens.

307	  

In this study, most of these genera were identified within the oyster that displayed high

308	  

abundances of OsHV-1 and bacteraemia. Psychromonas occurred within the three diseased

309	  

oysters, and might possibly be involved early in disease development, even if its pathogenic

310	  

role was not demonstrated so far. Furthermore, three bacterial families (Mycoplasmataceae,

311	  

Rhodospirillaceae, and Vibrionaceae) were linked to susceptible oysters in hatchery and/or

312	  

before disease development in the field. Among Vibrionaceae, Photobacterium genus was

313	  

mostly associated with SF32 in hatchery, and as well with low disease resistance oysters in a

314	  

previous study (King et al., 2019). Among Rhodospirillaceae, Thalassospira genus was

315	  

already identified in C. gigas oysters (Fernandez-Piquer et al., 2012). Even though

316	  

Rhodospirillaceae were found in diseased tissues of Platygyra carnosus corals (Ng et al.,

317	  

2015), there is no evidence that they may act as pathogens for oysters until now. Lastly,

318	  

Mycoplasmataceae family was abundant in C. virginica oysters from Hackberry Bay (King et

319	  

al., 2012), and decreased in oysters during experimental infections (de Lorgeril et al., 2018).

320	  

However, it was intriguing to find in this study that Mycoplasmataceae abundances were

321	  

significantly lower for resistant than susceptible oyster families in both hatchery and field

322	  

conditions, at the early steps of infection.

323	  

Putative beneficial bacteria of resistant oysters

324	  

Some observations suggested that bacteria might protect oysters from pathogens. For

325	  

example, Aeromonas media A199, Phaeobacter gallaeciensis and Pseudoalteromonas sp.

326	  

D41 improved survival of C. gigas against Vibrio strains when they were tested as probiotics

327	  

(Gibson et al., 1998; Kesarcodi-Watson et al., 2012). In particular, the Pseudoalteromonas

328	  

genus is known to produce a wide variety of biologically active secondary metabolites

329	  

(Kalinovskaya et al., 2004; Bowman, 2007). Finding beneficial bacteria could be interesting

330	  

and pave the way for prophylactic measures in oyster farming.

331	  

Here we identified three bacterial families associated with resistant oysters: Colwelliaceae,

332	  

Cyanobacteria (Subsection III, family I), and Rhodobacteraceae. Among Colwelliaceae, the

333	  

Colwellia genus was already found within C. gigas microbiota (Madigan et al., 2014). In this

334	  

study, this family and genus had high abundances for resistant oysters in hatchery, but they

335	  

were not significantly different between resistant and susceptible oyster families during

336	  

transplantation, suggesting a limited role in POMS. Moreover, although Rhodobacteraceae

337	  

was associated to juvenile oyster disease (Boettcher, 2005), this bacterial family was

338	  

commonly associated with oysters (Asmani et al., 2016; Takenaka et al., 2017; Arahal et al.,

339	  

2018). Strikingly, Cyanobacteria (Subsection III, family I) had low abundances in all

340	  

susceptible oyster microbiota before disease development, and were abundant in most

341	  

resistant oysters. Although cyanobacteria had a negative effect on other marine invertebrates

342	  

such as scleractinian corals (Meyer et al., 2016), they were already observed at high relative

343	  

abundances within oyster microbiota (Chauhan et al., 2014).	   Particularly, they were abundant

344	  

in the digestive gland, connective tissue, mantle, and gonad of oysters (Avila-Poveda et al.,

345	  

2014). Because cyanobacteria persisted in oyster tissues without signs of alterations, a

346	  

possible endosymbiotic relationship was even proposed (Avila-Poveda et al., 2014). Notably,

347	  

cyanobacteria were also negatively correlated to culturable Vibrio abundance in free-living

348	  

microbial communities (Turner et al., 2009). Hence, cyanobacteria might play a role of barrier

349	  

against pathogens from the genus Vibrio. In particular, photosynthetic activity of

350	  

cyanobacteria could inhibited pathogen growth through the production of reactive oxygen

351	  

species, such as observed for Plasmodium infection in Anopheles gambiae (Cirimotich et al.,

352	  

2011).

353	  

To conclude, we placed oysters from resistant and susceptible families in field condition for

354	  

five days during a period in favour of POMS. The analyses of oyster microbiota at the early

355	  

steps of infection revealed differences between resistant and susceptible oyster families.

356	  

These differences suggested that both the structure (evenness) and the composition (putative

357	  

opportunists, pathogens, mutualists) might predict oyster mortalities. Future studies should

358	  

test

359	  

Rhodobacteraceae, and Rhodospirillaceae within C. gigas microbiota. In particular, these

360	  

studies should evaluate the possibility of using Cyanobacteria (Subsection III, family I) as

361	  

probiotics for oyster farming.

Figure 1. Experimental design. Three oyster full-sib families were produced in controlled

602	  

condition (hatchery), and placed for five days in the environment (Atlantic Ocean, latitude:

603	  

48.335263; longitude: -4.317922) during an infectious period (July 2016). Then, oysters were

604	  

flash frozen, DNA were extracted, and microbiota were sequenced using 16S rRNA gene-

605	  

metabarcoding. Oysters deployed in the field during five days were followed during 8 days in

606	  

the hatchery. Survival rates were recorded at endpoint.

607	  

Figure 2. OsHV-1 and bacterial colonization in oysters at day 5 post-transplantation in

608	  

field condition during an infectious period. A. The OsHV-1 load was quantified by qPCR

609	  

and expressed as viral genomic units per ng of oyster DNA. Relative quantification of total

610	  

bacteria (B), and total vibrio (C) abundance were measured by qPCR.

A. Positive oysters for OsHV-1 detection (SF15.I.R14, SF32.I.R08, and SF32.I.R14). B.

613	  

Negative oysters for OsHV-1 detection for each family. These opportunistic genera were

614	  

identified in a previous experimental infection (de Lorgeril et al., 2018). Frequencies above

615	  

and below 4% are displayed in red and blue, respectively.
