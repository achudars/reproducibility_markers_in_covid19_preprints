ABSTRACT

Ion channel behaviour can depend strongly on temperature, with faster kinetics at physiological temperatures

14

leading to considerable changes in currents relative to room temperature. These temperature-dependent changes in voltage-

15

dependent ion channel kinetics (rates of opening, closing and inactivating) are commonly represented with Q10 coefficients

16

or an Eyring relationship. In this paper we assess the validity of these representations by characterising channel kinetics at

17

multiple temperatures. We focus on the hERG channel, which is important in drug safety assessment and commonly screened

18

at room temperature, so that results require extrapolation to physiological temperature. In Part I of this study we established a

19

reliable method for high-throughput characterisation of hERG1a (Kv11.1) kinetics, using a 15 second information-rich optimised

20

protocol. In this Part II, we use this protocol to study the temperature dependence of hERG kinetics using CHO cells over-

21

expressing hERG1a on the Nanion SyncroPatch 384PE, a 384-well automated patch clamp platform, with temperature control.

22

We characterise the temperature dependence of hERG gating by fitting the parameters of a mathematical model of hERG kinetics

23

to data obtained at five distinct temperatures between 25 and 37 ◦C, and validate the models using different protocols. Our models

24

reveal that activation is far more temperature sensitive than inactivation, and we observe that the temperature dependency of

25

the kinetic parameters is not represented well by Q10 coefficients: it broadly follows a generalised, but not the standardly-used,

26

Eyring relationship. We also demonstrate that experimental estimations of Q10 coefficients are protocol-dependent. Our results

27

show that a direct fit using our 15 second protocol best represents hERG kinetics at any given temperature, and suggests that

28

predictions from the Generalised Eyring theory may be preferentially used if no experimentally-derived data are available.

Ion channel currents are highly sensitive to temperature changes. Yet because many experiments are performed more easily at
room temperature, it is common to extrapolate findings to physiological temperatures through the use of Q10 coefficients or
Eyring rate theory. By applying short, information-rich protocols that we developed in Part I of this study we identify how
kinetic parameters change over temperature. We find that the commonly-used Q10 and Eyring formulations are incapable of
describing the parameters’ temperature dependence, a more Generalised Eyring relationship works well, but remeasuring
kinetics and refitting a model is optimal. The findings have implications for the accuracy of the many applications of Q10
coefficients in electrophysiology, and suggest that care is needed to avoid misleading extrapolations in their many scientific and
industrial pharmaceutical applications.

INTRODUCTION

72

Ion channel behaviour can depend strongly on temperature (1, 2), with physiological temperatures typically leading to faster
kinetics and different magnitudes of current than at room temperature, see for example (3, Figure 1). These temperaturedependent changes in voltage-dependent ion channel kinetics, e.g. rates of activation, deactivation, inactivation and recovery,
are commonly represented with either Q10 coefficients or an Eyring relationship. However, a detailed comparison between these
different representations for ion current modelling has not yet been undertaken. Here we characterise channel kinetics at multiple
temperatures, and test the validity of Q10 and Eyring rate theories by testing whether the kinetic parameters follow the trends
that these theories assume. For this case study we use the hERG channel which has been shown to have temperature-dependent
kinetics (3–5).
The human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming alpha subunit of the ion channel Kv11.1 that
conducts the rapidly activating cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr ) (6). Unless otherwise specified, we refer to
hERG1a simply as ‘hERG’ in the remainder of this paper. Pharmaceutical compounds that block IKr can prolong the cardiac
ventricular action potential (7), and are associated with both increased QT intervals on the body-surface electrocardiogram and
elevated risk of Torsade de Pointes (TdP) arrhythmia in patients (8). The existing International Council for Harmonisation S7B
regulatory guidelines for pharmaceutical development require the evaluation of drug effects on the hERG channel as part of
pre-clinical safety testing during drug development (9).
Drug effects on hERG are typically characterised by the concentration at which hERG channel activity is reduced by 50%
(the ‘IC50 ’) (10). However, no single measurement temperature nor method is used consistently across different laboratories
for measuring hERG IC50 values. Zhou et al. (4) and Vandenberg et al. (3) measured hERG1a temperature dependence, and
compared room and physiological temperature kinetics under typical activation and inactivation current-voltage (I-V) protocols.
A similar study with hERG1a/1b was performed more recently by Mauerhöfer and Bauer (5). These studies consistently report
that hERG kinetics are highly temperature-sensitive, something that is perhaps a property of potassium channels more widely
(2). The use of different temperatures and voltage protocols is therefore thought to be a large source of (deterministic) variation
in IC50 values (11–13).
In addition, drug screening data is often collected at room temperature, and requires extrapolation to physiological
temperature. The temperature extrapolation relies heavily on the accuracy of models of temperature-dependence. Some effort
has been made to model temperature effects on hERG kinetics based upon literature data (3, 4); for example Fink et al. (14)
attempted to use an Eyring relationship and Li et al. (15) used Q10 coefficients. However, a detailed comparison and assessment
of the applicability of these representations has not yet been undertaken.
In this paper, we study and model the temperature dependence of hERG kinetics using a cell-specific fitting technique, for a
range of room-to-physiological temperatures. We employ a staircase protocol that is applicable in automated high-throughput
patch clamp systems, developed in Part I of this study (16). We use a mechanistic model and its parameterisation to characterise
hERG kinetics at multiple temperatures, and compare whether these follow the temperature dependence of rate theories. Below,
we compare commonly-used temperature adjustments/models for hERG kinetic rates — the Eyring relationship and the Q10
coefficient.

Mathematical ion channel models are often expressed as a Hodgkin-Huxley model (17) or a Markov state model (18), and both
have rates (which we will call k) for transitions between the channel gates/states. To derive the rate k of transition between two
states, the occupancy of two states p(a), p(b) at equilibrium is assumed to follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:

barrier model, where only one rate-limiting step is required to transition between two states, the transition rate k is then directly
proportional to the fraction of system in the excited state, which leads to the commonly-used exponential form (19–21)

The temperature dependence of channel transitions is embodied in the Eyring equation. The original Eyring equation was
derived from basic thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, following from the the concepts of Gibbs free energy, entropy
and enthalpy (22). The typical form used to model voltage-dependent transition rates previously (14, 19, 21, 23) is

with physical constants: k B the Boltzmann constant, R the ideal gas constant, h the Planck constant, F the Faraday constant,
T the absolute temperature, and V the trans-membrane voltage. The following are unknowns (or ‘kinetic parameters’) to
be determined: ∆S the entropy difference, ∆H the enthalpy difference, ze the effective valency of the structure undergoing
conformational change. A more generalised Eyring relationship can be given by

where D is a coefficient that describes a temperature-independent effect of voltage on the transition rate. The Generalised
Eyring relationship is commonly used in the field of engineering, for example (24–27), although to the best of our knowledge it
has not been directly applied to ion channel modelling.
Without loss of generality, we can rewrite (reparameterise) Eq. 4, using unknowns aGE , bGE , cGE , dGE , absorbing all other
constants into these four new parameters, as



 
k GeneralisedEyring = aGE · T · exp −bGE · T −1 · exp cGE · T −1 + dGE V ,
(5)
where aGE = (k B /h) exp(∆S/R), bGE = ∆H/R, cGE = (ze F)/R, and dGE = D. By comparing Eq. 2 and Eq. 5, then we have


A = aGE · T · exp −bGE · T −1 ,

ln(A/T) = ln(aGE ) − bGE · T −1 ,

and
B = cGE · T −1 + dGE .

(8)

Therefore, plotting ln(A/T) against T −1 should yield a linear relationship if the Generalised Eyring relationship holds. Similarly,
from Eq. 8, we see that plotting B against T −1 yields a linear relationship for the Generalised Eyring relationship; or a
proportional relationship for the Typical Eyring relationship (dGE = 0). We refer to a plot of ln(A/T) or B as a function of T −1
as an ‘Eyring plot’.
Q10 coefficients

Another approach that is commonly used to describe temperature dependence in biological and chemical processes is the use of
Q10 coefficients. The Q10 relationship is an empirical expression (28), which assumes reaction rate increases exponentially
with temperature, and has been applied extensively to ion channel kinetics from Hodgkin & Huxley’s work to the present day
(3–5, 15, 29, 30). Using Q10 coefficients, we can express rates as

Here, α and β are parameters for the rate, and Tref is the reference temperature for the extrapolation. A Q10 coefficient is, by
definition, calculated using the ratio of the rates at Tref + 10◦ C and Tref . Comparing Eq. 2 and Eq. 9, we have

where aQ10 = (ln Q10 )/10◦ C, cQ10 = ln α − (Tref ln Q10 )/10◦ C. Therefore, if the Q10 formulation is accurate, then plotting
ln(A/T) against T −1 should yield a non-linear relationship, and B against T −1 is a horizontal line.

A theoretical comparison of the Eyring formulation and Q10 coefficient
We now compare the Generalised Eyring relationship (Eq. 4), the Typical Eyring relationship (Eq. 3) and the Q10 expression
(Eq. 9). Note that the Eyring relationships have been related to the Q10 expression (19, 31) to interpret the Q10 coefficient as the
change of entropy and enthalpy. However, in this study, we treat the two formulations independently.
For parameter A in Eq. 2, under the Eyring plot which we plot ln(A/T) (on the y-axis) against 1/T (x-axis), both the
Generalised Eyring and Typical Eyring relationships (Eq. 7) give y = mx + c which is a straight line; while the Q10 expression
(Eq. 11) becomes y = a/x + ln(x) + b which is not. This difference could be used to tell which theory is correct, but within our
temperature regime the Q10 expression on the Eyring plot gives a curve that is indistinguishable, in practical terms, from a
linear Eyring relationship, as shown in the top of Figure 1.
Therefore the only practically measurable difference between the potential temperature relationships is in B parameters
(which set the voltage dependence of the transition rate) in Eq. 2. The Generalised Eyring relationship implies that B has a
linear relationship with T −1 ; the Typical Eyring relationship restricts B to be directly proportional to T −1 ; and under the Q10
coefficient formulation, B is a constant that does not depend on temperature. These differences are illustrated in the bottom
panel of Figure 1.
The Typical Eyring relationship is a special case of the Generalised Eyring relationship, and therefore the Typical Eyring
relationship would hold if D = 0 were to be obtained when fitting the Generalised Eyring relationship: it will become clear later
on that this is not the case for our data. We hence consider and compare only the Generalised Eyring relationship and the Q10
formulation in the rest of this study.
There have been previous temperature-dependent hERG modelling studies. Fink et al. (14) expressed hERG kinetics using
the Typical Eyring relationship (Eq. 3), but its parameters were derived from experimentally estimated Q10 values in Vandenberg
et al. (3) yielding an incomplete form of the Eyring relationship based on Q10 values. Li et al. (15) used a Q10 formulation
(Eq. 9) to model temperature dependence of hERG kinetics for simplicity, but did not investigate to what extent this captured
temperature-dependent changes in the kinetics.
Modelling temperature effects in ion channel kinetics not only has applications in cardiac safety pharmacology, it is also
commonly used in action potential modelling more generally. Many cardiac action potential models (32–35) adapted the
Mazhari et al. (36) hERG model which used Q10 values from Zhou et al. (4) to extrapolate room temperature recordings to
physiological temperature. These extrapolations cause considerable changes to rates, often exceeding changes introduced when
modelling diseases or other conditions (37). Similarly, the Christé et al. (38) hERG model was based on measurements at room
temperature and extrapolated to 37 ◦C using Q10 values from Vandenberg et al. (3). Within action potential models, many other
ion current models (such as INa , ICaL , etc.) are also based on experiments performed at different temperatures (39), most of
which are then corrected via Q10 extrapolations (40–44).

Temperature dependence of hERG kinetics

MATERIALS AND METHODS

142

The experimental methods, mathematical model of IKr , and the IKr model parameter inference methods used in this paper were
identical to the methods detailed in our companion paper (16). We provide only a brief outline of these methods, for details
please refer to Lei et al. (16). Here we focus on the methods used specifically for studying the temperature dependence of the
channel.

Whole-cell patch-clamp voltage clamp experiments were performed on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected
with hERG1a (Kv11.1). Measurements were performed using the Nanion SyncroPatch 384PE (Nanion Technologies GmbH,
Germany), an automated high-throughput platform in which each run (or chip) is able to measure 384 wells (with one cell per
well) simultaneously. The temperature of machine’s ‘cell hotel’ was set to ∼15 ◦C. Single hole chips with medium resistance
(Nanion order number #221102) were used. Solutions used in all measurements are provided in Table S1 in the Supporting
Material.
A total of of 9 voltage clamp protocols were used, including the staircase protocol (16), an activation current-voltage (I-V)
protocol, a steady-state inactivation I-V protocol, a hERG screening protocol, a delayed afterdepolarization (DAD)-like protocol,
an early afterdepolarization (EAD)-like protocol, and action potential-like protocols with beating frequencies of 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz
and 2 Hz. A schematic of the experimental procedure is shown in Lei et al. (16, Figure 1). The whole sequence of protocols was
applied to every well. Details of these protocols can be found in Lei et al. (16, Supporting Material).

156

Only the staircase protocol was used in fitting (or calibrating) the mathematical model. The fitted models for each cell were
then validated by comparing their predictions for the other 8 protocols to the experimental recordings.

The SyncroPatch platform has a temperature control unit with software PE384TemperatureControl, which consists of a
temperature controller and several temperature monitors placed around the machine compartment. The machine compartment
contains all the solutions on stand-by and is where the measurements occurred. However, since the temperature controller
consists of a heater with a fan, it better maintains temperatures higher than room temperature than those close to room
temperature. Therefore, the lowest temperature we could maintain indefinitely was 25 ◦C, which is determined by the room
temperature (≈ 22 ◦C) plus heat generated by the machine’s operation (≈ 3 ◦C), even if the heat controller itself was set to a
lower temperature.

170

To ensure that we recorded the temperature correctly, an external K-Type thermometer was used to ensure the temperature
difference between the measuring stage and the machine in-built temperature monitors was . 0.5 ◦C. Note that the temperature
readouts could differ from the temperature set on the controller even after equilibrium, particularly close to room temperature,
so we used the thermometer and temperature monitors’ readouts as the true temperature of the experiments. The temperatures
of the five experiments were 25, 27, 30, 33, and 37 ◦C, and the uncertainty of our temperature measurements was estimated to
be ±1 ◦C by comparing the temperature differences at various locations of the compartment.

We performed a series of quality control checks and corrections (in post-processing) to ensure the currents recorded represent
only IKr . Leak corrections were applied to all measurements to eliminate leak current (16). E-4031 subtraction was applied to
remove any native voltage-dependent ion currents that were present in CHO cells besides the overexpressed hERG1a, usually
known as endogenous currents. Cells were then selected based on partially automated quality control described in Part I of this
paper (16), resulting in Ne = 124, 91, 85, 84, 45 cells being selected for measurements at 25, 27, 30, 33, and 37 ◦C, respectively;
and our 25 ◦C data were examined in Part I (16).

Data visualisation

189

Each hERG-transfected CHO cell was expected to have a different total conductance, hence giving a different magnitude for the
current recording. Therefore normalisation was applied for visual comparison. Note that the validation of model predictions was
performed without normalisation (a conductance was fitted for each cell individually). To avoid any circular reasoning involved
in normalising based on the gKr parameter fit within the models (which, at this point, may or may not vary with temperature), we
used an experimental maximum conductance estimate. The experimental estimate is approximated by extrapolating the negative
tail current, after the first 40 mV to −120 mV step, back to the time the voltage step occurred, see Figure S1 in the Supporting
Material. Note that this normalisation method is imperfect as it relies on a particular gating process (activation gate a ≈ 1 at the
end of the 40 mV step) which has some dependence on the kinetics we aim to compare, but the 22 ◦C parameterisation of the
model (45) suggests a ≈ 1 is a reasonable approximation (even for lower temperatures) at this point in the protocol. However,
since this method removes the conductance dependency, it has a benefit over the normalisation-to-a-reference-trace method
used in Paper I (16) by preserving the different magnitudes of currents from different temperatures.

We used the same Hodgkin & Huxley-style structure hERG model described in the complementary paper Lei et al. (16) and

IKr = gKr · a · r · (V − EK ),

where gKr is the maximal conductance, a is a Hodgkin and Huxley (17) activation gate, and r is an inactivation gate. EK is the

determined by the experimental solutions, 4 mM and 110 mM respectively. The two gates are governed by

First, we defined a transformation φ = ln(θ) to turn our positively constrained model parameters into unconstrained
parameters. For each temperature, we specified a statistical model to relate the mathematical model and the observed experimental
data:

where we assumed the noise term  follows a normal distribution  ∼ N (0, σ 2 ). Writing y = {yk } for the experimental data

where µ, Σ are the hyperparameters of the hierarchical model representing the mean vector and covariance matrix from which
Ne
the individual ‘low-level’ (well-specific) parameters are drawn. {θ j , σj } j=1
are the set of individual ‘low-level’ parameters
Ne
for each of the Ne repeats of the experimental recordings {y j } j=1
. The three terms in Eq. 24 correspond to (a) the likelihood
of all the individual (low-level) experiments; (b) the likelihood of the hyperparameters (top-level); and (c) the prior of the
hyperparameters and the prior of σj .
We assumed φ j for a particular cell (experiment) j follows a multivariate normal distribution, namely φ j ∼ N (µ, Σ). There
are two distributions describing the well-well variability in this hierarchical Bayesian model, one is the variability of the
samples of the mean parameter vector µ, and the other is the covariance matrix Σ. As described in the discussion of Lei et al.
(16), if we believe the well-well variability represented by Σ is primarily due to different patch clamp artefacts in each well,
then the uncertainty in µ represents our uncertainty in the underlying physiology, and we therefore believe it corresponds to
our uncertainty in the physiological hERG temperature response, rather than our expected variability in the results of future
experiments which would require Σ too.
For the choice of likelihoods and priors and sampling algorithms we used the simplified pseudo-Metropolis within Gibbs
(MwG) algorithm introduced in Part I (16, Supporting Material S6). All inference and sampling were done via our open source
Python package, PINTS (48); code is provided as described above.

Fitting Eyring and Q10 relationships
To investigate how well the two temperature models, the Generalised Eyring and the Q10 relationships, can explain the
temperature dependency of hERG kinetics, we fitted the two temperature models to the inferred distribution of the mean

parameter vector µ(T) for all temperatures T. To do so, first we transformed both the temperature models and µ(T) to the
Eyring plot form (see Figure 1). Second, we modelled the marginal distribution of µ(T) of pi at each T in the Eyring plot using
a normal distribution with mean µ̄i (T −1 ) and standard deviation σµ,i (T −1 ). We further assumed both µ̄i (T −1 ) and σµ,i (T −1 )
follow the temperature models, given by Eq. 7, 8 for the Generalised Eyring relationship and Eq. 11, 12 for the Q10 formulation.
Finally, given µ̄i (T −1 ) and σµ,i (T −1 ) (Figure S8 in the Supporting Material), we applied linear regression for parameters
A, B in the Generalised Eyring model (Eq. 7, 8 to infer aGE , bGE , cGE , dGE ) and a least squares method for only parameters A in
the Q10 relationship (Eq. 11 to infer aQ10 , cQ10 ) with the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm provided in SciPy (49); once to fit
the mean and once to fit the standard deviation of each parameter as a function of temperature. Due to the simplicity of the
problem after our transformation, a relatively simple optimisation algorithm was sufficient. For the B parameter in the Q10
relationship (Eq. 12), since it is a constant β, we decided to follow the standard way of using the Q10 relationship where models
are usually extrapolated from room temperature, therefore we directly used µ̄i (T −1 ) and σµ,i (T −1 ) at T = 25 ◦C to extrapolate to
other temperatures.
The estimated mean as a function of temperature was used to perform predictions for each temperature model; the estimated
standard deviation as a function of temperature allowed us to compute the uncertainty bounds of the IKr model parameter for
each temperature model.

Figure 2 shows the normalised voltage clamp recordings measured with the 9 different protocols, and the corresponding voltage
protocols, at the 5 temperatures. For each panel, from top to bottom shows the voltage clamp protocol (black), normalised
recordings (blue) that passed quality control at 25, 27, 30, 33, and 37 ◦C respectively. All results shown are the first of the two
repeats of our recordings.
Figure 2A shows the staircase calibration protocol (in black) and the corresponding experimental recordings (in blue). The
change in the recorded current as temperature increased was prominent, it increased the size of the current but also highlighted
alterations to the kinetics: during the first half (3–8 s) of the staircase protocol, at low temperature, there was almost no current
recorded; however, at physiological temperature, the current was almost as big as the current recorded during the second
half (8–13 s) of the staircase protocol. Furthermore, the shape of the current during the second half (8–13 s) of the staircase
protocol also changed as temperature increased. This demonstrates that the staircase protocol contains useful information on
how kinetics change with temperature.
Figure 2B–I shows experimental recordings for the other 8 validation protocols from the same cells. In validation protocol
1 (Figure 2B) we saw the activation I-V curve shifting to a lower voltage at higher temperatures. In validation protocol 3
(Figure 2D) and validation protocols 6–9 (Figure 2G-I) larger hERG currents were observed at higher temperatures. Both these
responses for hERG have been reported previously (3).

In Lei et al. (16), we showed exclusively the quality of fits and predictions for the hERG models at 25 ◦C, as this could be most
easily compared with previous manual patch results (45); the models replicated both the experimental training and validation
data very well.
Figure 3 shows the model fitting and validation results for all recorded cells at 37 ◦C alongside the experimental recordings
measured under the 9 different protocols. We fitted the model to the staircase protocol (Figure 3A) and validated against the
other 8 protocols (Figure 3B–I). To visually compare the variability in hERG kinetics (and not conductance), currents are
normalised by scaling them to minimise the absolute difference between each trace and a reference trace (as in 16). Similar
plots for all the intermediate temperatures are shown in the Supporting Material Figures S2–S4.
We applied the same error measure as in Part I of the study to quantify the fits and predictions — the relative root mean

values, and corresponding raw traces and predictions are shown in the three panels above. We note that the models only show
single exponential decays due to the limitations of the model structure whilst the data seem to show double exponential decays.
These results demonstrate that the hERG model remains a very good representation of the current kinetics, even at 37 ◦C, the
highest temperature. The same analysis has been applied to the intermediate temperatures, the results are shown in Supporting
Material Figures S5–S7.

Figure 5 shows the inferred parameter values, which are used in the model predictions in Figure 3 and Figures S2–S4, as a
function of temperature. The figure shows the inferred distribution of the hyperparameter mean vector µ (Eq. 24) using the
simplified pseudo-MwG at each temperature in a violin plot.
If the model kinetics were exhibiting temperature dependence following Q10 or Eyring rate theory, then lines whose function
is specified by these principles would fit the inferred parameters in Figure 5.
In Figure 5, most parameters show an obvious monotonic trend as temperature increases; although a handful take a slightly
more complicated form. It is obvious that the B parameters in the second row, pi with even i, are not constant over temperatures
as would be expected from the Q10 relationship. An Eyring plot version of Figure 5 is shown in the Supporting Material
Figure S8. We will compare these inferred parameters with the theoretical relationships in detail in the next section.
We then applied Eqs. 16 & 17 to calculate the steady-states a∞ , r∞ and time constants τa , τr at the 5 temperatures, using the
mean of the inferred distribution of µ at each temperature. Figure 6 shows the resulting voltage dependency of the steady-states
and time constants of the model gates a and r, where each temperature is indicated by a different colour (25 ◦C blue to 37 ◦C
red).
Figure 6 shows that as temperature increases, the steady-state of the activation gate a shifts in a negative voltage direction, a
prediction from the fitted model that is in agreement with the experimental observations in validation protocol 1: the voltage of
half-maximal activation (V1/2 ) of a∞ shifts from −7.5 mV at 25 ◦C to −30.9 mV at 37 ◦C, without a noticeable change in the
slope factor. However, the steady-state of the inactivation gate r does not show a prominent change over temperatures.
The time constant of both gates τa , τr show a similar effect as temperature increases; the maximum τa drops from 13.2 s
at 25 ◦C to 2.2 s at 37 ◦C, and the maximum τr drops from 14.3 ms at 25 ◦C to 3.6 ms at 37 ◦C. Note that τa is in the order of
seconds while τr is in milliseconds. The voltage which maximises the time constant shifts from −11.6 mV at 25 ◦C to −31.7 mV
at 37 ◦C for the activation gate, although it does not show a noticeable change for the inactivation gate.

Figure 7 shows the Generalised Eyring relationship and the Q10 equation fitted to the inferred parameters shown in Figure 5
(orange violin plot). The results are shown in the Eyring plot form: ln(A/T) and |B| as functions of T −1 . A version of Figure 7
with model parameters plotted directly against temperature is shown in Figure S9 in the Supporting Material. The Generalised
Eyring fits are shown as green fan charts with the first three standard deviations; the Q10 fits are shown similarly in red. The
obtained parameters for the Generalised Eyring equation (Eq. 4) and the Q10 equation (Eq. 9) are given in the bottom right
tables, one set for each rate ki , i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Reassuringly, the values in the tables are comparable to (the same orders of
magnitude as) typical literature values for ion channel models.
From the illustration in Figure 1, we expect the Generalised Eyring and Q10 formulations to be indistinguishable for the A
parameters, and indeed in Figure 7, the green fan charts (Generalised Eyring) are on top of the red fan charts (Q10 ) in the first

row: both formulations are able to fit to the inferred model’s A parameters.
Figure 7 shows that the Generalised Eyring equations fit better to the inferred model B parameters than the Q10 equations.
The Generalised Eyring equations are able to fit the inferred model parameters to a large extent except for p2 ; whereas the B
parameters in the Q10 equations are not temperature dependent (by definition), which is contradicted by our observations.
Furthermore, it is evident that for parameters p4 , p6 the two lines cannot intercept the y-axis close to the origin, as they are
decreasing rather than increasing on these plots. Parameters p2 and p8 also have non-zero estimates of D in the Generalised
Eyring relationship, indicating that the Typical Eyring relationship cannot be fit to any of our B parameters. The closest Typical
Eyring relationship for p8 is actually the example shown earlier in the bottom panel of Figure 1. The gradient of the Generalised
Eyring fit is approximately twice as steep as the Typical Eyring fit would require for this parameter.
In the literature, Q10 coefficients for biological processes such as channel gating are commonly thought to take values
from around 2 to 3 (50). To investigate this assumption, we projected our 25 ◦C model parameters directly using Eq. 9 with
Q10 ∈ [2, 3] and shown as the grey shaded region in Figure 7. Parameter p5 in the inactivation rate (k3 ) gives a Q10 just above 3,
but none of our other inferred relationships for parameter A is close to the range Q10 ∈ [2, 3].
Figure 8 shows the mean model predictions from the temperature-specific parameters (orange), the Generalised Eyring
formulation (dotted green), and the Q10 coefficient (dashed red) for the staircase protocol. The top panel shows the staircase
protocol, followed by the normalised current at 5 different temperatures. Data (in Figure 2A) are shown in fan charts style with
the 30th , 60th and 90th percentiles in blue. At low temperatures, all three models agree with the data. At higher temperatures,
particularly at 37 ◦C the predictions from the Generalised Eyring formulation (dotted green) still agree reasonably with the
temperature-specific independently fitted parameters (orange) and both fit the data (blue) well. However, the prediction from
the Q10 coefficient deviates from the data during the spikes (see zoomed-in images on the right) and does not predict the
time-course accurately during 4–7 s and 12–13 s of the staircase protocol (see insets in Figure 8).
Figure 9 shows a 2 Hz action potential-like protocol prediction version of Figure 8. All the three mean models are able to
predict the current during the repolarisation of the action potential clamp very well. The spikes during the upstrokes are however
badly predicted by the Q10 coefficient mean model; while the Generalised Eyring formulation, similar to the temperature-specific
parameters, gives a prediction closer to the data.

Figure 1: An Eyring plot illustrating the difference between a Generalised Eyring equation (Eq. 4), a Typical Eyring equation
(Eq. 3), and a Q10 formulation (Eq. 9). This plot extends from −10 ◦C to 50 ◦C to highlight the differences between the three
formulations. The green shaded region marks the temperature range of interest, from 22–37 ◦C. The Generalised Eyring
relationship shown has [ln aGE , bGE , cGE , dGE ] = [40, 1000, 3000, -70], and the Typical Eyring and Q10 relationships are the
best fits to the generated Generalised Eyring relationship. Both Eyring formulations give the same straight line dependence for
ln(A/T) and even the nonlinear Q10 formulation is indistinguishable (for practical purposes) within the relevant temperature
range. However, the three formulations can display very different behaviour when examining the temperature dependence of the
voltage-dependence parameter B.

Figure 7: Fitting of Generalised Eyring equation and Q10 equation to the distribution of the mean parameter values (mean
over all wells, µ, shown with an orange violin plot) on the Eyring axes. The obtained Generalised Eyring fits are shown as
green fan charts with the first three standard deviations; the obtained Q10 fits are shown in red. The fitted parameters for the
Generalised Eyring and Q10 equations are shown in the bottom right tables, one set for each ki , i = 1, 2, 3, 4. For Q10 equations,
Tref = 298.15 K was used. Note that the non-zero estimations of D in the Generalised Eyring relationship indicate that the
Typical Eyring cannot fit to all B parameters, as it is required to go through the origin. For comparison to typical Q10 values in
literature, where Q10 values are usually assumed to be around 2 to 3, we show the parameters prediction using Q10 ∈ [2, 3] as

DISCUSSION
In this study we have examined the temperature dependence of hERG kinetics, at five temperatures ranging from room to body
temperature, with 45 to 124 cells per temperature. We have used a mechanistic model and its parameterisation to capture our
knowledge of the hERG kinetics. By assuming that all cells share the same mechanism underlying hERG kinetics we have
based our study on the inferred model parameters at different temperatures to reveal the temperature dependence of hERG
gating kinetics. This is, to our knowledge, the first systematic effort to have taken this approach.
Using the staircase protocol, we were able to characterise hERG kinetics to the extent that our model can replicate both the
experimental training and validation data very well, for all of the measured temperatures. Our models can predict the current
response to the physiologically-relevant action potential protocols with a very high accuracy, demonstrating that our IKr models
are robust in predicting hERG current, in both healthy and arrhythmic situations. This gives us confidence that the cell-specific
model parameters do represent and capture hERG kinetics at the given temperatures.
The directly fitted models reveal that the activation gate has a much higher temperature sensitivity than the inactivation gate.
This effect is shown in both the comparison of steady-states and time constants (Figure 6) and the inferred Q10 coefficients
(Figure 7) where the Q10 values for the activation gate (k 1 , k2 ) are overall higher than the inactivation gate (k 3 , k4 ). Our inferred
Q10 coefficient for the rate of activation (k1 ) is relatively high compared to literature results (3, 4). However, our findings are
not implausible, when compared to other potassium channels, such as Kv2.1 and Kv4.3, which can have maximum Q10 values
up to the 20–30 range (2). Other ion channels can also exhibit a very high temperature sensitivity, such as TRP ion channels
which were reported to have Q10 values ranging from 2–15 in Dhaka et al. (1). We then further compare our model predictions
with the literature results in Vandenberg et al. (3).
Our hierarchical Bayesian models at different temperatures are not only able to predict our validation data but also able to
reproduce the temperature dependence seen in previous studies (3), where the increase of temperature caused a large increase in
the overall ‘steady state open probability’. In Section S8 of the Supporting Material, we describe how we reproduced Figure
6 of Vandenberg et al. (3). Figure 10 shows that our simulations (right panel) are broadly consistent with the temperature
effect observed in Vandenberg et al. (3) (left panel). The fan charts show the 30th , 60th and 90th percentiles of the simulations,
representing the inter-experiment (well-well) variability. There are differences between our simulations and their experimental
results, with a smaller open probability at low temperatures in our simulations and a slight shift of the curves to the right.
Nevertheless, our results are broadly consistent with the temperature effect observed in Vandenberg et al. (3) and predict a very
similar ‘width’ for this steady state window of open probability and also agree with the absolute values of the probabilities at
the higher temperature very well.
Q10 formulations have often been estimated in the past with different protocols, even for the same gating process (e.g.
activation). For example, two well-known experimental studies of temperature dependence of hERG kinetics, by Zhou et al. (4)
and Vandenberg et al. (3), estimated the Q10 coefficients using different protocols and analyses, and reported two very different
sets of Q10 coefficients (see Table 1) for various gating processes. We asked, if the two experiments were to be repeated with
the same underlying kinetics, would they agree with one another? Using our directly-fitted models at 25 ◦C and 37 ◦C, we
simulated the two different sets of experiments described in (3, 4), for details see Supporting Material Section S9. We then
estimated two sets of Q10 coefficients following the protocols and analysis in each of the papers, and the obtained values are
shown in Table 1. The findings in Table 1 show strong evidence that due to different protocols the estimated Q10 coefficients can
disagree. Furthermore, neither of the protocols reproduces the direct estimate of Q10 coefficients from the model parameter
temperature relationships (shown in the bottom right of Figure 7). We conclude that extreme caution should be used when
directly modifying rates in models with experimental estimations of Q10 coefficients.
Fitting directly to the staircase protocol at different temperatures does not require any assumption about the underlying
temperature dependence of the kinetic parameters, except that the model structure does not change. The existing well-known
models/approximations for temperature dependence of ion channel transition rates are the Q10 and Typical Eyring formulations.
Our study has raised concerns about how accurate these relationships are. In terms of parameter values (Figure 7) none of these
methods is able to capture the full temperature dependence of the directly-fitted parameters, µ(T), and predictably this impairs

their ability to fit and predict currents (Figure 8). However, using a Generalised Eyring relationship (not commonly used in
ion channel modelling) can closely mimic our full direct fitting approach (Figure 8, 9). Whilst the model predictions using
the Q10 formulation can generally predict overall trends in temperature effects, the predictions cannot capture the details of
the current, compared to the Generalised Eyring relationship or the full direct fitting approach (Figure 8 and 9). We therefore
suggest neither Q10 formulations nor the Typical Eyring relationship should be used: the Generalised Eyring relationship is
much better for temperature predictions. But for the best results the model should be refitted at any temperature of interest using
an information-rich protocol, such as our staircase protocol (16).
The nonlinearity of some kinetic parameters on the Eyring plots implies the Generalised Eyring relationship is a reasonable
but imperfect temperature model. Under the assumption that the model structure is correct, we accurately captured the kinetics at
each temperature, and the model structure stays the same for all temperatures. However, we could challenge these assumptions,
and suppose that the Generalised, or even Typical, Eyring relationship is true for any transition of ion channel from one

conformational state to another. In this case, the Eyring formulation not matching the individual temperature parameter sets
could imply that, either: (a) the hERG model structure that we have assumed is incorrect, i.e. the relationship not holding
is a consequence of discrepancy between the model and reality; or, (b) our procedure did not accurately capture the kinetic
parameters at each temperature, but the fact that the parameters give excellent fits and predictions (and many parameters do
follow expected trends) perhaps alleviates this concern; or, (c) in reality, the energy landscape of ion channel conformations
changes with temperature, and a given transition in the model represents a different jump in conformational state, i.e. the model
structure should change with temperature (which has been modelled previously (51)).
In any case, applying a simple treatment such as the Generalised Eyring relationship or the Q10 coefficient to an imperfect
model that violates the assumptions above would not automatically alleviate any mismatch. Since our temperature-specific fits
can replicate both the experimental training data and the validation data very well at all temperatures, the model is a good
representation of hERG kinetics. Hence it is better to apply a rapid and reproducible procedure, as illustrated here, for generating
all the parameters within a model at a new temperature, whenever possible. However, if necessary, then the Generalised Eyring
relationship would be a preferable choice for predicting kinetics at a new temperature where measurements cannot be, or have
not been, taken. While further work might show our results are more generally applicable to other channels, for now they should
be interpreted as being specific to hERG1a.
Our results have strong implications for how drug screening assays should be performed and interpreted. Since many of
the drug screening platforms work only at ambient temperature, measurements at different temperatures not only give rise
to a large source of (deterministic) variation but also introduce the problem of translation of their findings to physiological
temperatures. This translation is particularly problematic when an imperfect temperature model is used, such as the commonly
used Q10 coefficient, as shown in this study. Extreme caution should be taken when using temperature-extrapolated in vitro drug
screening data in in silico models for risk prediction.

414

Given we have shown Q10 coefficients definitely cannot capture the full temperature dependence of hERG kinetics (as
shown in Figure 7), and different drugs target different kinetics, then previous findings that there are no common set of Q10
coefficients to describe the kinetics of drug block (52), are consistent with our results. In future, one could use our models to
study some of the temperature effects observed in drug studies (11).

CONCLUSION

426

We have studied the temperature dependence of hERG kinetics using a 15 second high-information content protocol developed
in Part I of this study (16). We characterised the temperature dependence by fitting a mathematical model of hERG channel
kinetics to data obtained at five distinct temperatures between 25 and 37 ◦C. We constructed between 45 and 124 cell-specific
hERG models at each temperature using the 15 second calibration protocol, and our cell-specific variants of the hERG model
were able to predict currents under eight independent validation protocols with high accuracy. We represented the variability in
parameters using a hierarchical Bayesian model, and were able to reproduce the temperature dependence observed in previous
literature studies. Our hERG models reveal that, overall, the activation process has a higher temperature sensitivity than the
inactivation process. The temperature dependence of the kinetic parameters we obtained takes a more complicated form than
that predicted by Q10 coefficients or a Typical Eyring approach, although it broadly follows a Generalised Eyring relationship.
Our results show that a direct fit to the 15 second protocol is the best representation of hERG kinetics at a given temperature,
although predictions from the Generalised Eyring theory may be preferentially used if no such data are available.
