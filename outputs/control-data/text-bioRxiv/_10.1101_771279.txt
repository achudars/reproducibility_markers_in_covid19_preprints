In recent years, Zika spread through the Americas. This virus has been linked to

range has expanded and is anticipated to continue shifting as the climate changes.

We used statistical models to predict regional suitability for autochthonous Zika

inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models to

predict Zika outbreak suitability using 20 subsets of climate variables for 102 regions.

Variable subsets were selected for the final models based on importance to Ae. aegypti

survival and their performance in aiding prediction of Zika-suitable regions. We

27

determined the two best models to both be ZINB models. The best model’s regressors

28

were winter mean temperature, yearly minimum temperature, and population, and the

29

second-best model’s regressors were winter mean temperature and population.

30

These two models were then run on bias-corrected climate projections to predict

31

future climate suitability for Zika, and they generated reasonable predictions. The

32

predictions find that most of the sampled regions are expected to become more suitable

33

for Zika outbreaks. The regions with the greatest risk have increasingly mild winters and

34

high human populations. These predictions are based on the most extreme scenario for

35

climate change, which we are currently on track for.

Introduction

60

Recently, Zika has spread through many South American, Central American, and

61

Caribbean countries. There have been thousands of autochthonous Zika cases in US

62

territories like Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. In the mainland

63

US, there have been over two-hundred autochthonous cases in Florida and a few in

64

Texas [1]. In this paper, any Zika cases mentioned are autochthonous, meaning that the

65

infection occurred in the given region. The spread of Zika and the impact of climate

66

variation on its spread should be of concern to government officials, health professionals,

67

and citizens in the Americas. Although the symptoms are usually mild and short-lived,

68

Zika has been shown to be associated with Guillain-Barré, a disease that causes severe

69

weakness of the muscles, and can sometimes lead to paralysis [2]. In addition, pregnant

70

women who contract Zika can transmit the virus to their fetus, which can cause severe

71

birth defects, such as microcephaly [2]. Currently, there is no vaccination or cure for Zika

72

available, making it especially important to avoid contact with its vectors [3].

73

Since relatively less is known about the effects of climate on the Zika virus itself,

74

we seek to model this relationship through the effects of climate on the vectors that

75

spread Zika [4]. Ae. mosquitoes (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) transmit the Zika virus

76

[5]. Both Ae. mosquitoes take shelter in human habitations, but Ae. albopictus primarily

77

bites outside [4]. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes can undergo a winter diapause for up to a

78

year as eggs, making them more capable of surviving in temperate climates than Ae.

79

aegypti [6]. Ae. aegypti larvae develop more quickly at higher temperatures [7]. Larvae

80

develop fastest at 32ºC (89.6ºF), while significant mortality occurs at or below 14ºC

81

(57.2ºF) and at or above 38ºC (100.4ºF) [8]. The lower and upper limits for development

82

are 16ºC (60.8ºF) and 34ºC (93.2ºF), respectively [9].

83

Temperature also impacts the ability of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to fly and feed.

84

They can sustainably fly between 15ºC (59ºF) and 32ºC (89.6ºF) [10]. For a short flight,

85

the lower temperature limit is 10ºC (50ºF), and the upper limit is 35ºC (95ºF) [10]. In

86

addition, they feed more quickly between 26°C (78.8ºF) and 35°C (95ºF) than between

87

19°C (66.2ºF) and 25°C (77ºF), [11]. Ae. aegypti does not bite below 15°C (59ºF)

88

[11],[12],[13]. Ae. aegypti are most active at 28ºC (82.4ºF) [12], and the optimal

89

temperature for transmission is 29ºC (84.2ºF) [14]. Below 10 ºC (50ºF), Ae. aegypti

90

cannot move, and above 40ºC (104ºF), they die [9]. In Japan and Asia, the minimum

91

mean temperatures in winter months for a region to be habitable for Ae. aegypti were

92

suggested to be -2 and -5 ºC [15],[16]. There is less research concerning the effects of

93

temperature on the flight and feeding behaviors of Ae. albopictus [4].

94

For both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, temperature has been shown to be the

95

most crucial predictor of the vectors’ geographic distribution [17]. Ae. mosquitoes already

96

have geographical ranges covering much of the Eastern United States. In terms of

97

habitability for Ae. aegypti, the entire southeastern United States is a very likely range,

98

with much of the Southern Appalachian area being a likely range [18]. The geographical

99

range of the Ae. albopictus along the Eastern portion of the US is much larger, with the

100

very likely range stretching all the way from the tip of Florida to the middle of

101

Pennsylvania. The potential geographical regions for these two species of mosquitoes,

102

as determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are provided

119

that areas surrounding Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington would be suitable, but

120

does not reflect the suitability of Las Vegas, Nevada [20] or Phoenix, Arizona [22]. The

121

CDC’s map (Fig 1) also places all of Nevada in the “unlikely” or “very unlikely” ranges.

122

These maps’ lack of including all regions where Ae. aegypti can survive indicate that they

123

may need to be updated.

124

Currently, Ae. aegypti has trouble establishing populations in many temperate

125

regions because of their colder winters; their eggs have a high mortality rate upon

126

contacting frost [6]. In addition, there has been a decline in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes

127

associated with the invasion of the Ae. albopictus mosquitoes [23]. Ae. aegypti

128

mosquitoes prefer feeding on humans to other mammals, and feed numerous times

129

during the gonotrophic cycle, increasing the risk of transmitting disease from host to host

130

[6]. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes also prefer human blood, but they are opportunistic feeders

131

and will feed preferentially on whatever mammals are available [24], whereas Ae. aegypti

132

seek out human hosts even in the presence of other hosts [4],[6]. Ae. albopictus are less

133

competent vectors and are therefore less likely to spread Zika than Ae. aegypti

134

mosquitoes [24]. Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the primary vectors capable of

135

transmitting Zika [3], [25].

136

Attributed to both climate change and El Niño, Latin America was hotter than

137

average in 2015. There were high levels of precipitation in Southern Brazil and Uruguay

138

in the winter leading into 2015 [26]. Rain leads to standing bodies of water in the form of

139

puddles and water accumulated in other outdoors containers. These bodies of water

140

serve as breeding grounds for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes [26]. However, too heavy of rainfall

141

events can wash away larvae from breeding grounds, negatively affecting mosquito

142

population size [27]. Also, artificial containers of water provide breeding sites [28],

143

enabling mosquitoes to thrive during droughts [6],[29]. This is evinced by the start of the

144

Zika outbreak of 2015 occurring in northeastern Brazil during a drought [26]. Results

145

concerning the importance of precipitation to Ae. aegypti mosquitoes have been mixed,

146

and heat was likely a more important factor in the Brazilian Zika epidemic. In warmer

147

temperatures, viruses develop faster in vectors, inflating the proportion of infected

148

mosquitoes [30]. There also tend to be more people outside and people with exposed

149

skin to be easily infected [26]. It follows that maximal Zika transmission has been found

150

to occur between 26 and 29ºC [31].

151

Over the past few decades, Ae. aegypti has expanded its geographical range

152

[6],[32]. Their distribution is expected to continue shifting as the climate shifts, putting new

153

people at risk of Zika [6],[32],[33]. Since Zika is closely related to the dengue virus, and

154

the two are both spread by Ae. aegypti, research relating climate to the spread of the

155

dengue virus can also be applied to Zika [26],[34]. Temperature increases may expand

156

Ae. aegypti’s range, increasing the range of the virus, but some areas may get too warm,

157

leading to a decrease in Ae. aegypti and a decrease in virus transmission in some areas

158

[26]. Therefore, research concerning climate change and Zika vectors is crucial for

159

understanding how Zika risk in different regions may evolve in the coming decades.

160

Researchers have used a variety of methods to model the spread of Zika in

161

different regions. In 2017, Zhang et al. used temperature, vector density, socioeconomic

162

factors, human mobility, and demographic data in a “data-driven global stochastic

163

epidemic model” to predict the spread of Zika in the Americas [35]. In 2018, Lo and Park

164

used Ae. aegypti density, human density, and temperature data to perform a topological

165

analysis to model the spread of Zika in Brazil [36]. Also in 2018, Huber, Caldwell, and

166

Mordecai used a dynamic disease transmission model to examine the impact of different

167

aspects of temperature: seasonal variation, seasonal mean, and value at epidemic onset

168

on disease dynamics in twenty cities [14]. The New York City (NYC) Department of Health

169

and Mental Hygiene applied a zero-inflated Poisson model to estimate which census

170

tracts in NYC have the highest risk for Zika being imported by humans [37]. Other

171

researchers have used SEIR model variations, time series models, and stochastic models

172

for Zika-related research [36]. For other mosquito-related research, zero-inflated models

173

have been used to model the relationship between weather and dengue incidences in

174

China [38], mosquito egg abundance in Eastern Europe [39], Ae. albopictus females and

175

egg abundance in France [40], and to analyze the density of adult malaria mosquitoes in

176

Kenya [41]. In addition, the relationship between water volume changes in containers and

177

Ae. aegypti pupal abundance has been explored in Vietnam [42]. Our method is unique

178

in its relatively simple yet useful approach in characterizing a regions suitability for Zika

179

outbreaks using only historical climate, population, and Zika data.

180

The magnitude of the climate variations we will experience depend on our efforts

181

to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) being emitted. We can do a lot more

182

to lower our emissions and not continue on the path aligning with the “business as usual”

183

scenario, which accompanies the most extreme projections for climate change. In this

184

manuscript, we explore the potential for Zika’s geographical reach to expand or shift with

185

changes in climate by comparing Zika case predictions of statistical models trained using

186

past climate data and future climate projections. Where by training a model, we mean

187

providing an algorithm and data for the model to learn from. The overall goal of this

188

research was to develop a statistical regression model that can identify regions capable

189

of experiencing a Zika outbreak and to use this model to predict what regions may be at

190

an increased risk for Zika outbreaks as the climate changes. As desired, we achieved this

191

goal.

192
193

Methodology

194

To quantify how climate variations may impact the potential spread of Zika

195

outbreaks in the Americas, we sought out to build statistical models in R that could

196

accurately identify regions that have already reported at least one Zika case and regions

197

that presently have the potential for Zika infections to occur. Such models were created

198

with the goal of predicting what areas may be impacted by Zika in the near future (2020-

199

2045) given the variations in climate. To start, we constructed statistical models using

200

various subsets of climate variables relevant to the survival of Ae. aegypti. The regression

201

models we selected to compare were zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative

202

binomial.

203

To gain a basis for understanding the zero-inflated Poisson regression model, we

204

first consider the Poisson regression model. This is the simplest model in the family of

205

generalized linear models (GLMs) [43]. The dispersion parameter is 1; the canonical link

206

is 𝑔(𝜇𝑖) = log (𝜇𝑖), and the variance is 𝜇𝑖 [43]. Mathematically, the predictions from a

207

Poisson model take the following form when there are m explanatory variables: log (𝜇𝑖) =

208

𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑥1 + 𝛽2𝑥2 + … + 𝛽𝑚𝑥𝑚, where log (𝜇𝑖) = log (𝐸(𝑦𝑖)) is the natural log of the

209

expected value of the response variable 𝑦𝑖, and the 𝑥𝑗s are the explanatory variables [44].

210

This is equivalent to: 𝜇𝑖 = exp (𝛽0) exp (𝛽1𝑥1) exp (𝛽2𝑥2)…exp (𝛽𝑚𝑥𝑚), where exp (𝛽0) is
10

211

the effect on 𝜇𝑖 when all the 𝑥𝑗s are zero, and exp (𝛽𝑗) is the multiplicative effect that every

212

unit increase in 𝑥𝑗 has on 𝜇𝑖 with all the other 𝑥𝑘s held constant [44],[45]. Concerning the

213

values of the 𝛽𝑗s, if 𝛽𝑗 = 0, then there is no association between 𝑦 and 𝑥𝑗; if 𝛽𝑗 > 0, then

214

𝜇𝑖 increases when 𝑥𝑗 increases, and if 𝛽𝑗 < 0 then 𝜇𝑖 decreases when 𝑥𝑗 increases [44].

215

A potential issue with Poisson models is overdispersion, which occurs when the

216

variance of the data differs from the variance of a Poisson random variable [44],[45]. If

217

overdispersion occurs, an adjustment can be made [44], or a quasi-Poisson [46] or

218

negative binomial model could be used instead [44],[45]. If the overdispersion is due to a

219

greater number of zeros than would occur in Poisson distribution, a zero-inflated Poisson

220

(ZIP) or a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model should be considered [43],[45].

221

The next model we introduce is the count portion of the ZINB model: the negative

222

binomial regression model. The probability density function for the negative binomial

223

distribution takes the form: “𝑓(𝑦;𝜇,𝜃) = exp

224

the mean; 𝜃 is the shape parameter, and Γ( ∙ ) is the gamma function [43]. The shape

225

parameter can either be specified or estimated from the data. The negative binomial

226

model has the same dispersion parameter as the Poisson model, but rather than being

227

set equal to the mean, the variance is governed by the function: “𝑉(𝜇) = 𝜇 + 𝜃 ” [43]. The

228

negative binomial model for expected count has the same form as that of the Poisson

229

model but accounts for over-dispersion using an additional parameter [44],[47].

(

Γ(𝑦 + 𝜃)

𝜇𝑦 ∙ 𝜃 𝜃

)

” [43]. In this equation, 𝜇 is
Γ(𝜃) ∙ 𝑦! ∙ (𝜇 + 𝜃)𝑦 + 𝜃

𝜇2

230

The ZIP and ZINB regression models are useful when too many zeros are

231

observed than would naturally occur in a Poisson or negative binomial distribution [45],

232

[47]. This was the case with our dependent variable, Zika cases. A zero-inflated model is

233

defined to be a “two-component mixture model combining a point mass (logistic

234

regression model) with a count distribution”, which was either Poisson or negative

235

binomial as in our case [43]. In the S1 Text, we summarize technical information on zero-

236

inflated models provided by Zeileis, Kleiber, and Jackman [43] and Dr. Diane Lambert. If

237

there are excess zeros, and there is still over dispersion when a ZIP model is used (i.e.,

238

over dispersion not from the excess zeros), a ZINB model may be a better fit [48]. As

239

reflected through the models’ performances, this was the case with our data as well.

240

Next, we acquired all observational and projected climate data through Climate

241

Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) Climate Portal [49]. Originally, each

242

region that reported Zika cases was going to be represented by the yearly temperature

243

and precipitation data for the years 2015 to 2017, since those were the years that Zika

244

data was available from the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) [50]. However,

245

for some of the areas outside of the United States, the necessary weather data was not

246

available for those years from reliable resources. For the sake of consistency and

247

reliability, we chose to use historical data from 1980-2005 from CCAFS, since it was

248

available for all the necessary regions in North and South America. Some Caribbean

249

islands that had Zika cases were not available through this source.

250

Originally, we were going to use data for each US state and territory and for each

251

country outside the US. However, only looking at the number of Zika cases and the

252

climate at the country level for all nations other than the US and at the state level for some

253

US states would leave out significant climate variation across some nations. So, we chose

254

to further break down the following nations and US states: Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia,

255

Paraguay, Texas, Mexico, Canada, California and Florida. Since the highest level of detail

256

in reporting Zika cases was at the district/state level in the selected South American

257

countries, we chose a point in each state or district to represent the climate there. Almost

258

all of these points represented a city in the state/district, with the exception of La Paz,

259

Bolivia. Bolivia ranges from low-lying zones with warmer temperatures to colder

260

mountainous zones, and the district of La Paz contains both of these [51],[52]. Since the

261

largest city in La Paz, also named La Paz, is in the mountainous region deemed unlikely

262

to be inhabited by Ae. aegypti, we chose a point in a lower-lying, warmer part of the district

263

of La Paz instead [51]. For the selected cities, we selected a longitude and latitude point

264

in the center of the dot representing the city and downloaded the historical climate data

265

and the bias-corrected past future projections. We chose to use cities as representative

266

points since Ae. aegypti tend to live near people and bite inside buildings.

267

CCAFS obtained historical climate data from Agricultural Climate Forecast System

268

Reanalysis (AgCFSR), which combines “daily resolution data from retrospective analyses

269

(…the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, CFSR) with in situ and remotely-sensed

270

observational datasets” [53]. The uncorrected historical and future climate projections

were from the Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model 1.1 in the Coupled Model

272

Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5). The CCAFS Climate Portal authors then bias-

273

corrected these projections using quantile mapping [49].

274

The future of the climate is uncertain and depends on the emissions levels today

275

and in the years to come. So, for the future climate projections, we selected the emissions

276

scenario that we are currently on track for, Representative Concentrations Pathway 8.5

277

(RCP 8.5). This is the highest emissions scenario explored by the CMIP5 climate

278

modelers, so the temperature and precipitation changes in the future scenarios are

279

expected to be more extreme than in lower emissions scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 6).

280

This scenario is also interesting to consider in terms of its potential impact on the habitable

281

areas for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, because currently they are limited from spreading as

282

far north as Ae. albopictus mosquitoes have because their eggs cannot survive the cold

283

winters. With these winters potentially becoming warmer under this emissions scenario,

284

Ae. aegypti mosquitoes could potentially inhabit a wider range of areas. However, some

285

regions that are warm enough for these mosquitoes could become too hot in the summer

286

and experience a decline in Ae. aegypti populations, and in turn, Zika infections.

287

Since the CCAFS climate data was not available for the years in which the Zika

288

outbreaks occurred, we compared the historical climate data to monthly weather data

289

provided by Weather Underground from the years that Zika was reported in the Americas

290

(2015-2017) [54]. This data was not used in the model because the weather reports for

291

2015-2017 were either filled with missing/bad data or entirely unavailable for some of the

292

Zika-positive regions. For many of the Zika-positive regions, the weather reports

293

contained a few unrealistic or missing observations. These “bad” observations were

294

identified using judgment based on the reported temperatures from the rest of the month

295

and the climate of the region. To replace unrealistic or missing values, we used

296

“seasonally decomposed missing value imputation” [55]. In R, the function that performs

297

seasonally decomposed missing value imputation is called na.seadec and the package

298

containing this function is package imputeTS [55]. This function first eliminates the

299

seasonal component, imputes missing values using linear interpolation, then reinstates

300

the seasonal component [55]. After performing seasonally decomposed missing value

301

interpolation, we calculated the statistics winter.mean, summer.mean, year.min,

302

year.mean, year.max, year.prec, and year.diff for the years 2015-2017 for Zika-reporting

303

regions. We then compared these statistics to those calculated from the 1980-2005

304

CCAFS climate data by computing the mean and median differences between them and

305

the mean absolute differences as shown in Table 1.

306

We chose the climate variables to be used in the models based on their importance

307

to Ae. aegypti. Since temperature is the most important factor in determining Ae. aegypti’s

308

geographical range, most of the variables were chosen to describe the central tendency

309

and spread of temperature throughout the year. Initially, we were going to include

310

precipitation since it plays a role in breeding ground availability for Ae. aegypti. However,

311

there were major discrepancies in precipitation between the years the Zika outbreak

312

occurred and the years in the historical period used to train the models. So, we eliminated

313

this variable. We included the mean difference between daily maximum and minimum

314

temperature since large temperature changes in 24 hours negatively impacts female

315

reproduction [56]. The climate variables considered were: mean yearly minimum

316

temperature (year.min), mean yearly mean temperature (year.mean), mean yearly

317

maximum temperature (year.max), an indicator for year.mean being within the range in

318

which Ae. aegypti can sustainably fly (year.mean15to32), the mean difference between

319

the daily maximum, and daily minimum temperatures (year.diff), the mean yearly winter

320

mean temperature (winter.mean), and the mean yearly summer mean temperature

321

(summer.mean).

322

To obtain the average yearly minimum (mean) (maximum) temperature, we took

323

the minimum (mean) (maximum) of all the daily minimum temperatures for all the days

324

for each year. Then we averaged the yearly minimums (means) (maximums) for minimum

325

(mean) (maximum) daily temperature over the 21-year period. We calculated winter.mean

326

and summer.mean by taking the mean of the mean temperatures for December, January,

327

and February, the taking the mean of the mean temperatures for June, July, and August,

328

and then assigning one of these means to winter and one to summer depending on

329

whether the region of interest is above or below the equator.

330

Counts of Zika cases per country were obtained from PAHO; cases in US states

331

were obtained from the CDC, and cases in states/districts of non-US countries that were

332

further broken down this way were obtained from their respective health surveillance

333

websites and PAHO [57],[58],[59],[60]. First, we gathered the most recent Zika data made

334

available on the PAHO website, which was dated 1/4/2018 [50]. For regions that were

335

divided into smaller regions, this data set was used to scale the more specific

336

geographical distribution data. Scaling was necessary because the geographical

337

distribution data was found in other sources reported at different time periods, leading

338

them to have different reported numbers of Zika cases for each region of interest than

339

was reported in the final PAHO report. These sources include earlier PAHO reports for

340

individual South American countries that were dated before the latest report was released

341

and the country/states’ websites when they were available. Paraguay’s website where

342

PAHO obtained its data was no longer available. So, for selected departments (Amambay

343

and the Metropolitan Area of Asuncion), we took the total number of cases in 2016,

344

occurring in Amambay, the Metropolitan Area of Asuncion, Alto Parana, and Paraguari,

345

and scaled them by the areas’ proportion of the population where the cases were

346

observed to estimate numbers of cases for specific departments [60]. All of the Zika and

347

climate data was recorded in Excel spreadsheets, which are available in the

348

supplementary information. Each row of the spreadsheet has data for the point

349

representing the specified department, state, or city in the specified region.

350

Next, we performed the exploratory analysis by creating histograms for all of the

351

independent variables and the dependent variable, Cases (number of Zika cases up to

352

2018). The histogram of Cases revealed a much larger number of zeros than would have

353

been observed in the Poisson or negative binomial distribution, so we decided that a zero-

354

inflated model would likely perform best. We also noticed that the standard deviation of

355

Cases was much larger than the mean, indicating over dispersion possibly due to the

356

excess zeros. So, we decided to train both the zero-inflated negative binomial and

357

Poisson models using different subsets of the climate statistics as regressors and

358

compare their performances in predicting Zika outbreak suitability.

359

Each of 40 models (20 ZIP and 20 ZINB) created was trained on the historical

360

climate and Zika data using all rows minus one, then run on the row left out of the training

361

set to predict the number of Zika cases for that region. For each model, this process

362

repeated 101 more times so we could get the model’s prediction for each region without

363

training the model using that region. In terms of regressors used in these models, we

364

started with the simplest subset first: only one regressor. The variable chosen was

365

year.min, since susceptibility to cold is a limiting factor in the Ae. aegypti’s distribution.

366

Next, we tested the performance of a simple model using another measure of coldness:

367

winter.mean. Since there were over 1,000 potential models, we did not test all possible

368

model; not all combinations of regressors would have been logical to test anyway.

369

Instead, we chose 20 subsets of climate variables; each subset would be tested using a

370

ZIP and a ZINB model. The model performances were evaluated based on soundness of

371

model coefficients (i.e., coefficients that should be positive were positive and coefficients

372

that should be negative were negative), ability to predict at least one Zika case for all

373

regions that reported Zika cases, and for regions that did not yet report Zika, only

374

predicting one case or more for regions that presently could experience a Zika outbreak.

375

We define Zika-suitable regions as those currently inhabited by or determined to be

376

capable of being inhabited by Ae. aegypti by at least two out of three of the potential

377

distributions discussed in the introduction. In the potential distribution provided by the

378

CDC, we considered an area in the “likely” or “very likely” range to be capable of being

379

inhabited by Ae. aegypti. The presence of Ae. aegypti is correlated to Zika outbreaks if

380

there are individuals in that region with Zika. Since we used count models, we considered

381

a prediction of at least one Zika case to indicate that the model considers a region suitable

382

for Zika.

383

For the regions that reported Zika, we compared each model’s predictions to the

384

observed cases by calculating the mean of the absolute values of the residuals, then we

385

scaled these values by dividing them by the number of cases observed to get the mean

386

scaled residual. The mean scaled residual values were considered secondarily to the

387

other methods of evaluating model performance. We determined that the zero-inflated

388

negative binomial models consistently outperformed the zero-inflated Poisson models.

389

The final models were two ZINB models (ZINB1 and ZINB2). The best performing model

390

(ZINB1) used winter.mean and year.mean in the zero-inflation model and the same

391

variables plus Pop.100.000 in the count model. The second best performing model

392

(ZINB2) used winter.mean only in the zero-inflation model and winter.mean plus

On average, both the winters and summers of 2015-2017 were near 1 ºC warmer for Zika-

407

positive regions than they were in 1980-2005. The increase in winter.mean reflects an

408

increase in Zika suitability between these two time frames. The average yearly minimum

409

and yearly mean temperatures were also higher in general for 2015-2017 than they were

410

for 1980-2005, also reflecting an increase in Zika suitability. The average yearly maximum

411

temperature was lower in 2015-2017 than for 1980-2005. If the yearly maximum was near

or above 32 ºC, the yearly maximum decreasing from 1980-2005 to 2015-2017 could

minimum temperature decreased from 1980-2005 to 2015-2017, likely reflecting an

between precipitation and habitability for the mosquitoes that transmit Zika is complex,

.253128, an increase in population of 100,000 increases the log of the predicted cases

434

by .011674, and a 1 ºC increase in year.min increases the log of the predicted cases by

436

increase of 1 ºC of winter.mean changes the log-odds of a region observing at least one

437

case by -.87352, and an increase of 1 ºC of year.min changes the log-odds of a region

438

observing at least one case by .03751. Since all the coefficients in the count model are

positive, the model’s coefficients are satisfactory.

440

Concerning the model’s predictions for Zika-free regions, the median is

441

.007292707; the mean is 169.0705, and the standard deviation is 986.7907. Fig 3A below

shows the geographic distribution of ZINB1’s predictions for Zika-free regions that were

at least one. The Zika-free regions with the highest predictions were Los Angeles,

445

Arizona; San Francisco, California; Nevada, and Mississippi. Fig 3B shows the

472

Beginning with the count model’s output, based on log(𝜽), the estimate of the

473

dispersion parameter is about 3.3131. Holding the other regressors constant, a 1ºC

474

increase in winter.mean changes the log of the predicted cases by 0.278441, and an

475

increase of 100,000 in populations increases the log of the predicted cases by 0.011834.

476

In the zero-inflation model, an increase of 1ºC of winter.mean changes the log-odds of a

477

region observing at least one case by -0.7836. Again, since all the coefficients in the count

478

model are positive, they are satisfactory.

479

For the Zika-free regions, the model predicted a median of 0.0102, a mean of

480

146.0512, and a standard deviation of 828.4233. Fig 4A shows the geographic distribution

481

of ZINB2’s predictions of at least one for Zika-free regions. Fig 4B shows the distribution

482

of predictions for Zika-free regions. The Zika-free regions with the highest predictions, i.e.

483

predicted to have the most Zika-suitable climates, were: Los Angeles, California; Orlando,

484

Florida; Louisiana; Uruguay; Cordoba, Argentina; Houston, Texas; Arizona; San

485

Francisco, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Mississippi.

486

For the Zika-positive regions, the model predicted a mean of 27885.65, a median

487

of 8116.381, and a standard deviation of 91221.87. The Zika-positive regions predicted

488

to have the most Zika-suitable climates were Peru; Venezuela; Miami, Florida; Nicaragua;

Brownsville, Texas; Haiti; Dominican Republic; Manaus, Brazil; Panama; and Guyana.

is 0.06621878, and the standard deviation is 1374.127. The distribution of change in

517

predictions is provided in Fig 5D. As shown in Fig 5C, the Zika-free regions predicted to

518

see the greatest increases in Zika suitability include: Los Angeles, California; San

520

Cordoba, Argentina; Nevada; and South Carolina. The only Zika-free region predicted to

521

see a decrease in Zika suitability was Orlando, Florida. However, as previously stated,

522

Shifting focus to the Zika-positive regions, ZINB1 predicts that on average, the

537

regions that have already seen Zika will continue to be more Zika-friendly on average

538

than the Zika-free regions. For the future predictions, the mean is 28795.99; the median

539

is 7177.149, and the standard deviation is 92643.17. As shown in Fig 6A, the regions

540

predicted to see the most Zika-suitable climates in the future period include Peru;

541

Venezuela; Colombia; Haiti; Nicaragua; the Dominican Republic; Panama; Suriname;

542

Miami, Florida; and Brownsville, Texas. As shown in Fig 6D, for changes in predictions,

543

the mean is 5033.435, the median is 3157.645, and the standard deviation is 19710.42,

544

indicating that these regions are expected to become more suitable for Zika outbreaks

545

based on the climate projections considered. As shown in Fig 6C, the regions that have

546

reported Zika that are expected to see the greatest increases in Zika outbreak suitability

547

are Venezuela; Colombia; Haiti; the Dominican Republic; Nicaragua; Panama; Suriname;

548

Puerto Rico; Jamaica; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only two presently Zika-positive

549

regions predicted to experience a decrease in Zika outbreak suitability were Peru and

550

Miami, Florida.

Discussion

616

In summary, the two top performing models perform well in terms of having

617

acceptable model coefficients, predicting at least one Zika case for all regions that

reported Zika, and only predicting at least one case for regions that are habitable for Ae.

619

aegypti. Both models were able to predict suitability for Ae. aegypti and in turn Zika

620

outbreaks for the chosen subset of regions.

621

First, we compared the historical averages of the climatic variables used in the

622

model to the values of these variables from 2015-2017, when the Zika outbreak in the

623

Americas occurred. The mean deviations of the 2015-2017 observations from the

624

historical averages were relatively small (between 1 and 2 ºC) for the variables

625

winter.mean, summer.mean, year.mean, and year.diff. The average yearly mean

626

temperature was higher in the years 2015-2017 than it was in 1980-2005. For year.min,

627

the mean deviation from the historical average almost 3 ºC, and for year.max, the mean

628

deviation was just over 3 ºC. On average, year.min and year.mean were higher and

629

year.diff was lower in the years 2015-2017 than in the years 1980-2005, all changes

630

making regions more conducive to Zika outbreaks. None of the selected models used the

631

variable year.max, so the deviation in this variable is not concerning. For year.prec, the

632

mean deviation was large: almost 1000mm. Most of the places that reported Zika were

633

much drier between 2015 and 2017 than they were between 1980 and 2005, which is

634

unsurprising given the drought reported in Brazil the year than Zika broke out. Since

635

year.prec was not used in any of the selected models, the deviation between the climatic

636

average yearly precipitation and the yearly precipitation in 2015-2017 should not impact

637

the performance of the models.

638

Generally, the ZINB models outperformed the ZIP models. We speculate that the

639

additional variable to deal with over dispersion in the ZINB models contributed to the

640

performance differences. Concerning the performances of the top two models with Zika-

30

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/771279; this version posted September 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

641

free regions, ZINB1 outperformed ZINB2 by only predicting at least one case for regions

642

that either reported the presence of Ae. aegypti or were identified as having suitable

643

climates by at least two out of three present potential distributions considered [17][18][21].

644

ZINB2 predicted just more than one case for Seattle, Washington, which does not

645

have Ae. aegypti [33],[62] and is not included in at least two out of three of the likely

646

habitable ranges considered in this paper [17],[18],[21]. Still, this is not too concerning

647

since the prediction is just over one. Both ZINB1 and ZINB2 gave the highest predictions

648

to regions with Ae. aegypti. Both ZINB models predicted a median of less than one,

649

although ZINB1 gave more predictions very close to zero, as indicated by its smaller

650

median. ZINB2's predictions were smaller on average than ZINB1’s, as reflected by their

651

mean predictions.

652

Concerning the ZINB Models’ performances with regions that did report Zika,

653

both models predicted at least one case for every region. This is crucial, because if a

654

model is to be used to predict where Zika will be a problem in the future, we need to be

655

sure that it does not miss places, resulting in unpreparedness for Zika prevention. For

656

the scaled residuals, ZINB2 had a smaller mean, median, and standard deviation.

657

However, the models’ performances in predicting exact numbers of cases for Zika-

658

positive regions was considered secondarily to their performances in identifying regions

659

that could experience Zika outbreaks. So, we conclude that ZINB1 performed the best.

660

Looking to the future, the predictions from both the ZINB Models appear to be

661

reasonable: they reaffirm findings that support increased spread of Ae. aegypti

662

mosquitoes, and in turn increased climate suitability for Zika outbreaks. Based on the

663

output of these models, the regions that have not yet reported Zika that are most likely to

Colombia; Haiti; Nicaragua; the Dominican Republic; Suriname; Panama; Jamaica; Rio

670
671

Future Considerations

672

Moving forward, these regions especially should prepare by educating citizens

673

about ways to prevent Zika infections, such as wearing long sleeves, using screens on

674

doors and windows, and using an EPA-registered insect repellant [63]. Economically

675

disadvantaged areas with poor access to water from pipes should work on more secure

676

water storage methods to reduce the creation of Ae. aegypti breeding grounds in water

677

containers [64]. Research institutions in these places should record more sightings of Ae.

678

aegypti and Ae. albopictus and look more into the potential for Ae. albopictus to become

679

as much or more of an issue than Ae. aegypti in spreading Zika. For example, if the

680

increasing populations of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes that have been driving down Ae.

681

aegypti populations in the US develop as strong a preference for human blood as Ae.

682

aegypti or start to bite primarily inside houses as well, they could become the primary

683

vector for Zika. As these mosquitoes already can survive and reproduce in cooler

684

climates, this could potentially cause more of an issue for Northern regions. In addition,

685

since less is known about the impacts of temperature on Ae. albopictus’s feeding and

686

flying habits, more research should be conducted in that area as well.

687

The BCCCSM1.1 RCP85 climate projections are based on our current trajectory,

688

the highest emissions scenario, which results from not significantly reducing GHGs.

689

These projections suggest that many regions may become more hospitable for Ae.

690

aegypti, and many regions that have not seen autochthonous Zika cases before may see

691

them in the future. If actions are taken to reduce GHGs, less severe changes may occur

692

than those projected under this scenario, possibly reducing the risk for Zika to spread to

693

new regions.

694

In future research, we could use the weather data from the years that the Zika

695

outbreak in the Americas occurred to build the models. Although this data is not available

696

from stations in some of the selected cities in regions that observed Zika (Quito, Ecuador;

697

Georgetown, Guyana; Cayenne, French Guiana; and Port De Paix, Haiti), we could look

698

for the necessary data from other stations in those countries, or we could use historical

699

averages for those regions only. Also, we could increase the temporal resolution of these

700

models’ predictions. Given that monthly or seasonal Zika data is available for enough

701

regions, we might accomplish this by predicting the number of Zika cases per season

702

between the beginning of 2015 and the end of 2017 using the climate data of each season

703

and the season before it [14]. We would also look for socioeconomic data for each region,

704

since socioeconomic factors can contribute to the creation of breeding grounds through

705

water storage methods [64]. We could also see how Ae. aegypti density and population

706

density perform as regressors, as they were useful variables in the research of Lo and

707

Park [36]. As a different method of projecting suitability for Zika outbreaks, we could model

708

incidence rate or percentage of population infected, like Huber, Caldwell, and Mordecai

709

had done, rather than modeling cases and including population as one of the regressors

711

between regions.
