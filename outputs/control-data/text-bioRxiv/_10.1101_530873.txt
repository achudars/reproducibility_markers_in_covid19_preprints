ABSTRACT:
The natural abundance of coiled coil (CC) motifs in the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix suggests that CCs play a crucial role in the bidirectional mechanobiochemical signaling between cells and
the matrix. Their functional importance and structural simplicity has allowed the development of numerous applications, such as protein-origami structures, drug delivery systems and biomaterials. With
the goal of establishing CCs as nanomechanical building blocks, we investigated the importance of
helix propensity and hydrophobic core packing on the mechanical stability of 4-heptad CC heterodimers. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we show that both parameters determine the forceinduced dissociation in shear loading geometry; however, with different effects on the energy landscape. Decreasing the helix propensity lowers the transition barrier height, leading to a concomitant
decrease in the distance to the transition state. In contrast, a less tightly packed hydrophobic core increases the distance to the transition state. We propose that this sequence-structure-mechanics relationship is evolutionarily optimized in natural CCs and can be used for tuning their mechanical properties
in applications.

Coiled coils (CCs) are self-assembled, superhelical motifs that are naturally found in numerous
proteins in the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.1 CCs consist of two (or more) α-helices, each
characterized by a repetitive pattern of seven amino acids, called heptad (abcdefg)n (Figure 1A).
Positions a and d form the hydrophobic core of the superhelical structure; e and g are mostly charged
amino acids, which participate in interhelical salt bridges; b, c and f are solvent-exposed, often polar
amino acids, which contribute to the helix propensity of the individual helices.2

heterodimer in the shear geometry. C) Sequences of the CCs used in this study. The terminal cysteines define the
shear pulling geometry. The helix propensity of the CC-forming peptides was calculated using AGADIR.16

Utilizing this simple design, CCs serve as model systems for studying protein folding and
stability. As a result, they are increasingly used as templates for protein design and sequences with a
pre-determined thermodynamic stability can now be synthesized de novo.3-6 Such sequences find
application in peptide-based hydrogels7-10 and protein origami structures11,12 as well as in biosensors13
and drug delivery systems.8,14-15 Considering their natural role as a mechanical scaffold, surprisingly
little information is available about the sequence-structure-mechanics relationship of CCs. With the
goal of introducing CCs as nanomechanical building blocks, we have characterized three different CC
heterodimers with atomic force microscope (AFM)-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS;
Figure 1B). We show that hydrophobic core packing and helix propensity affect the thermodynamic
stability in similar ways; however, the underlying changes to the energy landscape are different.

Using the thermodynamically and mechanically well characterized CC A4B4 as the starting point
(Figure 1C),5,17 we used the standard rules of CC design2-3 to obtain one sequence with a reduced helix
propensity and a second sequence with a different hydrophobic core packing. To reduce the helix
propensity, Ala in the b position was substituted with Ser in all heptads18 (A4SB4S; Figure 1C).
Hydrophobic core packing was altered using another β-branched amino acid in position a (Val instead
of Ile; A4VB4V). The Asn in the third heptad was not replaced to maintain hetero-specificity.19-20 To
define the points of force application, Cys was introduced at the desired termini for coupling the CC to
the surface and the AFM cantilever. For A-peptides, Cys was located at the N-terminus, while it was
placed at the C-terminus of B-peptides, thus establishing a shear pulling geometry (Figure 1B).
To validate the design and to compare mechanical and thermodynamic stability, the CCs were
first investigated with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Wavelength scans, showing an α-helical
signature with minima at 208 nm and 222 nm and thermal denaturation experiments are shown in
Figure S1. As expected, A4B4 shows the highest melting temperature Tm, while A4SB4S and A4VB4V
were significantly destabilized (Table 1). The corresponding free energy difference between the folded
(F) and the unfolded (U) state (ΔGF-U) was obtained from van’t Hoff plots (Figure S2). In comparison
to A4B4, both modified CCs also show a lower ΔGF-U, which follows a similar trend compared to other
CCs reported in the literature.3,21-22
To address the question whether the thermodynamic and mechanical stabilities are correlated and
how the respective substitutions affect the energy landscape, SMFS was carried out. The B-peptide
was immobilized to the cantilever, while the corresponding A-peptide was immobilized to the surface
(Figure S3). The CC only forms when the cantilever is in contact with the surface. When retracting the
cantilever, the CC experiences a steadily increasing force until it ruptures (Figure 1B). At a retract
speed of 400 nm s-1, both A4SB4S and A4VB4V are mechanically less stable than A4B4 (Figure 2A). At
this retract speed, the most probable rupture forces decrease 20 pN and 15 pN for A4SB4S and A4VB4V,
respectively. This provides a first indication that the substitutions also lower the mechanical stability
of the CCs.
Subsequent dynamic SMFS, performed over a range of loading rates (r = dF/dt)23 from
approximately 15 pN s-1 to 11000 pN s-1, revealed that both modified CCs possess a lower mechanical

stability over the complete range of loading rates (Figures S4-S6); however, their dependence on the
loading rate is different. Fitting the data to the Bell-Evans model23 (Figure 2B) allows for obtaining
more detailed information about the energy landscape of the CC two-state system (folded CC vs.
random coil peptides): koff, the force-free dissociation rate, and ΔxF-TS, the distance from the folded to
the transition state (TS). Using the Arrhenius equation, also the barrier height between the folded and
the transition state (ΔGF-TS) can be calculated, provided that the Arrhenius pre-factor is known. Here,
we use an Arrhenius pre-factor of 5 ´ 108 s-1, which was estimated for the dimeric GCN4 leucine
zipper.24 Table 1 summarizes the obtained fit values, as well as the calculated ΔGF-TS values.

Comparing the koff values of A4SB4S and A4VB4V to A4B4 shows that both modifications lower the
height of the transition state barrier (higher koff and lower ΔGF-TS). This lower barrier height is

correlated with the different thermodynamic stabilities (Table 1) and helix propensities of the three
CCs (Figure 1C). This suggests that a reduced helix propensity lowers the barrier height, thereby
affecting both the thermodynamic and mechanical stability of the CCs. Interestingly, the ΔxF-TS values
do not correlate with the thermodynamic stabilities. The Ala-Ser modification (A4SB4S) reduces ΔxF-TS,
whereas the Ile-Val modification (A4VB4V) increases ΔxF-TS. This suggests that modifications in the
solvent- exposed residues affect the energy landscape of the CC interaction differently when compared
to hydrophobic core modifications.

CCs respond to an applied axial stretching force in three phases.17,25-27 Initially, the force increases
linearly with extension and the helices remain intact (phase I). At a strain of 10-20 %, the individual
helices start uncoiling at an almost constant force (phase II). In long CCs, the force increases sharply
after the helices are uncoiled and the resulting structure is extended further (phase III). For CCs with a
length of ≤4 heptads loaded in the shear geometry, the CC chains separate in phase I or just at the
transition to phase II.17 This is a direct result of the chain separation mechanism. At loading rates
typically used in SMFS, the applied force causes the uncoiling of helical structure at the points of
force application. This, in turn, destabilizes the CC thermodynamically and facilitates the subsequent
dissociation of the CC chains (uncoiling-assisted dissociation). This mechanism allows for explaining
the effects of helix propensity and hydrophobic core packing on CC shearing.

When mechanically loaded in shear geometry, the hydrogen bonds stabilizing the individual
helices are aligned parallel to the force vector, whereas the hydrophobic side chains are arranged
almost perpendicularly. The torsional angles and helical propensities of the individual amino acids,
which are responsible for maintaining stable hydrogen bonds in the helices,18,28-29 are thus critically
determining the resistance of CCs to shear forces. For CCs with a lower overall helix propensity less
force is required to uncoil the individual helices. In addition, a lower helix propensity is correlated
with a lower thermodynamic stability. Uncoiling of only small parts of helical structure thus
destabilizes an already less stable CC further, an affect that was observed earlier when decreasing CC
length.17 Assuming that the hydrophobic core is not altered, this suggests that chain separation occurs
at smaller extensions. In the case of A4SB4S, a higher koff value is thus accompanied by a shorter ΔxF-TS.
This result is in line with the observation that artificial constraints, which stabilize the helices against
uncoiling, lead to an increase in the forces required for chain separation.10,30

Figure 3. Energy landscape of the CCs. The horizontal line represents the distance from the folded (F) to the
transition state (TS) (ΔxF-TS), while the vertical solid arrow represents the transition barrier height (ΔGF-TS). The
dotted arrow shows the energy difference between the folded and the unfolded state (ΔGF-U).

Following this line of argumentation, ΔxF-TS for A4VB4V is expected to lie in between the values
obtained for A4SB4S and A4B4; however, A4VB4V shows an increase in ΔxF-TS. This suggests that
substituting Ile with Val does not only affect the helix propensity. It also causes a less tightly packed
and more flexible CC interface. The increased ΔxF-TS can thus be explained as follows: the pre-existing
flexibility at the hydrophobic core permits a more dynamic rearrangement of the Val side chains in

response to the applied force. In other words, a less densely packed hydrophobic core facilitates a
relative displacement of the helices prior to or during helix uncoiling. This agrees with other protein
unfolding studies, where destabilizing substitutions in the hydrophobic core loosened the packed
interface.31-32 Likewise, higher unfolding rates and larger distances to the transition state were
detected, an effect that has been termed mechanical softening. Alternatively, the increase of ΔxF-TS can
as well be explained with a different solvation of the core amino acids in the transition state.22,33
In summary, the combination of helix propensity and hydrophobic core packing determines the
mechanical stability of CCs; however, with different effects on the energy landscape (Figure 3).
Whereas a reduced helix propensity decreases both the barrier height and the distance to the transition
state, an increase in the transition state distance is obtained when decreasing the hydrophobic core
packing. It appears likely that natural CCs are evolutionary optimized to balance these different
effects. Clearly, both parameters can be utilized when designing CCs with controlled mechanical
properties for future applications. Most interestingly, these parameters can be used to obtain CCs with
similar thermodynamic stabilities that possess a different dynamic response to an externally applied
force. Such systems will find application as molecular force sensors34 or as physical hydrogel
crosslinks, which show a pre-defined response to mechanical deformation.
