Summary

2

Kinesins are well-known to power diverse long-range transport processes in virtually

3

all eukaryotic cells. The ATP-dependent processive stepping as well as the

4

regulation of kinesin’ activity have thus been focus of extensive studies over the past

5

decades. It is widely accepted that kinesin motors can self-regulate their activity by

6

suppressing the catalytic activity of the ‘heads’. The distal random coil at the C-

7

terminus, termed ‘tail domain’, is proposed to mediate this autoinhibition, however, a

8

direct regulatory influence of the tail on the processive stepping of kinesin proved

9

difficult to capture. Here, we simultaneously tracked the two distinct head domains in

10

the kinesin-2 motor using dual-color super resolution microscopy (dcFIONA) and

11

reveal for the first time their individual properties during processive stepping. We

12

show that the autoinhibitory wild type conformation selectively impacts one head in

13

the heterodimer but not the other. Our results provide key insights into the regulated

14

kinesin stepping that had escaped experimental scrutiny.

Introduction

2

Maintenance of a eukaryotic cell is a daunting task of logistics. One key organizer of

3

the eukaryotic cytoplasm is kinesin, a microtubule-associated molecular motor that

4

transports cargo in diverse settings throughout the cell [1–6]. After association with

5

the trail, kinesin takes many steps in a hand-over-hand fashion with its two head

6

domains and covers micrometer distances in vitro (Figure 1A, top panel). To this

7

end, the motor is propelled by the energy provided by two alternating ATP hydrolysis

8

cycles in the so-called ‘head’ domains [7,8]. Communication between the respective

9

cycles ensures that at least one head remains bound to the microtubule to prevent

10

premature dissociation of the motor from its track [9,10]. The timing of these cycles is

11

characterized by the so-called dwell times, e.g. the time one head remains bound to

12

the filament between steps [11].

13

Notably, the ATPase activity of kinesin motors can be suppressed by a self-

14

regulatory mechanism termed autoinhibition [12,13]. This is thought to be achieved

15

by folding of the distal C-terminal tail domain onto the N-terminal head domains

16

(Figure 1A, bottom panel). Either removal of the distal tail or preventing the inhibitory

17

folding relieves autoinhibition in vitro (Figure 1A, top panel) [12,14]. Indeed,

18

autoinhibition is proposed to interfere with the entry into a ‘run’ as well as with the

19

stepping of the motor [8–10,12–16]. Competitive binding to cargo or phosphorylation

20

are thought to disengage the tails from the heads in vivo and in vitro [15–17].

21

Importantly, ectopic activation has been shown to considerably hamper kinesin

22

function in vivo suggesting that self-inhibition is integral to kinesin-dependent

23

transport processes [18]. How the tail-mediated inhibition interferes with the dynamic

24

stepping of a kinesin motor at the molecular level remains an open question

25

[17,19,20].

1

Several kinesins that belong to the kinesin-2 family form heterotrimeric complexes

2

comprising two distinct motor subunits and one non-motor subunit [15,21–23]. At the

3

example of the heterotrimeric KLP11/20/KAP motor from C. elegans, we previously

4

unmasked the distinct contributions of the KLP11 and KLP20 subunits to the motility

5

and autoinhibition of the heterodimeric KLP11/20 motor in vitro [24]. Indeed, the

6

presence of two kinetically distinct head domains in a kinesin motor long provoked

7

the question of ‘limping’ during the stepping cycles, i.e. a difference in the stepping

8

behavior of the two heads [17,19,25–31]. Limping in kinesin-1 could be enforced

9

under load, however, limping has so far not been resolved with full-length wild type

10

motors during unperturbed stepping [32]. Resolving limping, in particular,

11

necessitates the separation of the dwell time information for each individual head

12

domain within the dimeric motor.

13

Here, we utilized the heterodimeric nature of the KLP11/20 motor to extract the dwell

14

times from each distinct head simultaneously. To this end, we implemented dual

15

color fluorescence imaging with one nanometer accuracy (dcFIONA) that exposed

16

for the first time the respective dwell times of individual head domains during

17

stepping. The capability to extract information simultaneously from both heads

18

ultimately confirmed the previously suggested limping behavior as well as the

19

inhibitory impact of the tail domain on the stepping of the kinesin motor.

KLP11 dwell times are fitted well by the double exponential model with similar values for both

parameters λ1 and λ2 (right panels). Fitting of the KLP20 data shown in the left panels with the same

model yields a ratio of the two parameters that is about two orders of magnitude higher, resulting in a

10

The two heads of the KLP11/20 motor display distinct stepping behaviors

11

The dwell times for kinesin constructs that were labeled on one head only were

12

shown to be distributed according to a double exponential distribution [7,21]. This

13

reflects the ATP-waiting time for the labeled head and the hidden step for the second

14

motor domain [7,21]. In our measurements, we can now extract the dwell times in

15

the ‘step primed’ position, i.e. only the time a head spends in the trailing position

16

before it takes the step.

17

At limiting ATP concentrations, we measured the individual dwell times of the two

18

heads in the eeKLP11Halo/20Snap motor (Figure 1B). For these dual color

19

measurements, one single exponential distribution would be expected for each head

20

[35]. Intriguingly however, we observed two different distributions (Figure 2, left vs

21

right panels). While the dwell times obtained from the KLP20 head domain displayed

22

a single exponential distribution as expected, the dwell times extracted from the

23

KLP11 head domain clearly deviated from a single exponential but were instead

24

consistent with a double exponential distribution (Figure 2, right panels).

To exclude any influence of the respective fluorophores or their recording by our

2

setup, we switched the dyes (eeKLP11Halo/20SNAP vs eeKLP11Halo/20SNAP) on the

3

respective head domains (Figure 2A vs 2B). In addition, we also switched the

4

position of the Halo- and SNAP-tags themselves (eeKLP11Halo/20SNAP vs

5

wtKLP11SNAP/20Halo) to exclude any influence of the specific tags on the behavior of

6

the motor per se (Figure 2B vs 2C). In both cases, we confirmed the double

7

exponential dwell time distribution for the KLP11 head domain (Figure 2, right

8

panels), while the KLP20 head domain consistently displayed a single exponential

9

distribution (Figure 2, left panels).

10

To further test the consistency of this observation, we fitted both data sets using the

11

same double exponential model (see Supplementary Information). For the KLP11

12

head domain, the ratio of the two involved parameters was close to 1 (Figure 2, right

13

panels), indicating a similar influence of both values on the stepping behavior. For

14

the KLP20 head domain, in contrast, the ratio was about 100-fold higher, ultimately

15

resulting in a near single exponential fit (Figure 2, left panels).

16

Together, these findings suggest that the steps taken by the KLP11 head domain

17

include a second rate-limiting event in addition to the waiting time for ATP binding

18

[7]. The observed differences in the dwell time distributions as displayed by the

19

KLP11 and KLP20 head domains ultimately confirm the presumed limping for

20

heterodimeric motors [17,19,25–31]. This behavior of a single head domain could so

21

far not be resolved by tracking the net movement of the motor due to the similar

22

mean dwell times of the two heads [25].

23

What is the origin of the second rate constant that is displayed specifically by the

24

KLP11 head domain? Notably, our previous work with the wtKLP11/20 suggested an

1

asymmetric autoinhibition mechanism [24]. It required both the presence of the tail

2

and the correct positioning of the KLP11 head within the wtKLP11/20 heterodimer.

3

Strikingly however, solely swapping the positions of the KLP11 and KLP20 head

4

domains sufficed to activate the autoinhibited wtKLP11/20 motor in single molecule

5

and bulk ATPase assays [24,36]. These findings provoke the question whether the

6

presence of the C-termini in the eeKLP11/20 per se influences the dwell time

7

distribution of the KLP11 head domain. If true, the autoinhibitory folding in the

8

wtKLP11/20 stalk would be expected to enhance this effect specifically in the KLP11

9

data (Figure 1A, bottom panel).

10

Difference in stepping gives insight into the autoinhibition of kinesin-2

11

To test this hypothesis, we extracted long dwell times (>2 s) from the KLP11

12

distributions from Figure 2 (right panels) and refitted them with a single exponential

13

model (Figure 3A). For the wtKLP11/20 motor, the resulting dwell time parameter

14

increased 1.6-fold when compared to the eeKLP11/20 that contains the ATPase

15

activating mutations in the stalk (Figure 3, left panels). This 1.6-fold difference is in

16

fact consistent with the decreased speed of the wild type motor at saturating ATP

17

concentrations (Figure 3B) [20].

18

The first rate constant present in both dwell time distributions is attributed to the

19

ATP-waiting time at low ATP concentrations [7]. Based on previous data [37–39], we

20

speculate that the second rate constant in the dwell time distribution of the KLP11

21

head domain results from the tail-suppressed ADP release. This effect is strong in

22

the wild type motor in which the flexible hinge in the stalk enables autoinhibitory

23

folding and consequently enhances the ‘head-tail’ interaction (Figure 1A, bottom

24

panel). When the stalk is mutated to prevent autoinhibitory folding (Figure 1A, top

2

times in the KLP11 stepping (Figure 2, right panels A+B vs. C). Taken together, our

3

capability to distinguish the two head domains during processive stepping provides

4

compelling support for an asymmetric autoinhibition mechanism in the KLP11/20

5

heterodimer [24]. Indeed, our results unmask for the first time the influence of the tail

6

on the dynamic stepping of a physiological kinesin motor.

for run length data of the respective motors).

4

Previous tracking of one head domain in the homodimeric kinesin-1 at nanometer

5

resolution using FIONA already represented a major breakthrough given the small 8

6

nm net displacement of the motor [7]. Being able to trace two head domains

7

simultaneously with the dual color FIONA introduced here now allows the dissection

8

of the specific contributions of the head domains to the processive stepping and the

9

regulation thereof at the single molecule level. The next major experimental

10

challenge towards a comprehensive understanding of the kinesin stepping

11

mechanism will be the correlation of the stepping behavior to specific events in the

12

respective ATPase cycles of the motor domains.

Single molecule experiments

2

Speeds and run length were measured at an ATP concentration of 2 mM. Movies

3

were recorded with an exposure time of 200 ms and 500 frames were recorded

4

before changing the position in the sample.

5

For step detection experiments, the ATP concentration was reduced to 0.4 µM, the

6

creatin phosphate/creatin phospho kinase system guaranteed stable ATP

7

concentrations over the duration of data collection. Movies were recorded with an

8

exposure time of 400 ms for dual color experiments, resulting in a cycle time of 405

ms.

Data analysis

11

All data analysis was performed using ImageJ and custom routines implemented in

12

Matlab (Mathworks Inc.). Traces for speed and run length measurements were

13

extracted by identifying and following peaks depending on their brightness. A

14

position with subpixel accuracy for these traces was assigned using a radial center

15

approach [40]. Runs over several frames were connected by following peaks

16

according to their distance to a peak in the previous frame. Overall distances were

17

calculated with respect to the first detected position in a run. Speeds where then

18

calculated by performing a linear regression on the distance over time data and

19

extracting sequences, that fitted with an r-squared value higher than 95%. Run

20

lengths were determined from the maximum distance from the starting point for each

21

run.

For step detection experiments, a least-squares fit procedure was used to fit a

23

Gaussian profile to the peak data with a starting point deduced from the initial

detection of the brightest pixel. This fit provided a higher accuracy subpixel position

2

for each frame, compared to the radial center approach. Due to the lower speeds,

3

the distance over time traces show distinct relocation events. An implementation of

4

the Potts algorithm was used for step detection [41]. Single position spikes in the

5

distance traces were filtered out. The individual sizes of steps were calculated from

6

the mean distances before and after each step.

7

An algorithm was used to extract sequences of alternating steps in both channels.

8

Dwell times were then calculated from the time of a step in one color to the next step

in the other color.

Dual exponential fit

3

In our first impression, the two dwell time distributions for KLP11 and KLP20 were

4

distributed according to a double and single exponential model respectively. To

5

support this assumption, we fitted both distributions with a double exponential model

6

and show, that one of the parameters vanishes for the KLP20 dwell times. The

7

model used was:

8

𝐴(𝑒 −𝜆1𝑥 − 𝑒 −𝜆2 𝑥 )

9

We used the same settings and starting point for the fit:

10

A = 150; λ1 = 0.3; λ2 = 10;

11

In order to focus on the shorter dwell times, where the effect of the double

12

exponential distribution can be seen best, we introduced a weight function that

13

describes the weight the corresponding data point contributes to the fit:
