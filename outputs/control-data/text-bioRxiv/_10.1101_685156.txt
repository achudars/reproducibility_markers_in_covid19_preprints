Abstract
Electronic Health Records (EHR) are data
generated during routine interactions across
healthcare settings and contain rich, longitudinal
information on diagnoses, symptoms, medications,
investigations and tests. A primary use-case for
EHR is the creation of phenotyping algorithms
used to identify disease status, onset and
progression or extraction of information on risk
factors or biomarkers. Phenotyping however is
challenging since EHR are collected for different
purposes, have variable data quality and often
require
significant
harmonization.
While
considerable effort goes into the phenotyping
process,
no
consistent
methodology for
representing algorithms exists in the UK. Creating
a national repository of curated algorithms can
potentially enable algorithm dissemination and
reuse by the wider community. A critical first step
is the creation of a robust minimum information
standard for phenotyping algorithm components
(metadata, implementation logic, validation
evidence) which involves identifying and reviewing
the complexity and heterogeneity of current UK
EHR algorithms. In this study, we analyzed all
available EHR phenotyping algorithms (n=70)
from two large-scale contemporary EHR resources
in the UK (CALIBER and UK Biobank). We
documented EHR sources, controlled clinical
terminologies, evidence of algorithm validation,
representation and implementation logic patterns.
Understanding the heterogeneity of UK EHR
algorithms
and
identifying
common
implementation patterns will facilitate the design of
a minimum information standard for representing
and curating algorithms nationally and
internationally.

1 Introduction
In the United Kingdom (UK), structured electronic health
records (EHR) spanning primary care, hospital care,
disease/procedure registries and death registries are used to

research studies [Hemingway et al., 2018]. Through a
process called phenotyping, researchers create algorithms
which utilize multiple EHR sources to accurately extract
information on diseases (e.g. status, onset and progression),
lifestyle risk factors and biomarkers [Banda et al., 2018].
Phenotyping however is challenging due to the fact that
EHR are fragmented, curated using different controlled
clinical terminologies and collected for purposes other than
research (e.g. reimbursement, audit) [Morley et al., 2014].
Phenotyping requires a significant amount of resources and
mix of expertise, yet no common standard approach for
defining, validating and ultimately sharing EHR
phenotyping algorithms currently exists. In the UK,
structured primary care EHR have been used in >1,800
peer-reviewed studies to date but only 5% of studies
published sufficiently reproducible phenotypes [Springate et
al., 2014]. Defining a standardized format to represent EHR
phenotypes will enable portability across data sources (and
healthcare systems) and facilitate the systematic sharing of
algorithms across the community [Mo et al. 2015].
Compared to the United States (US), the UK EHR research
landscape differs in two important ways: 1) researchers can
utilize multiple national EHR sources to create longitudinal
‘cradle to grave’ phenotypes [Kuan et al., 2019], and 2) UK
primary care EHR contain both healthy and unhealthy
individuals which allow researchers to capture information
on disease severity and progression over time. A recent
systematic review identified 66 different definitions used to
capture asthma status and exacerbations in research using
UK EHR [Al Sallakh et al., 2017] demonstrating significant
existing heterogeneity. While analyses have been
undertaken in the US to characterize the heterogeneity of
phenotyping algorithms [Conway et al., 2011], no such
analysis has been carried out in the UK.
One of the aims of the newly-established national institute
for health data science, Health Data Research UK (HDR
UK, www.hdruk.ac.uk), is the creation of a national
Phenomics Resource: an open-access online resource where
EHR phenotypes can be deposited and curated. A critical
first step in this process is to establish a minimum

information standard for representing EHR phenotyping
algorithms. This involves exploring and documenting the
complexity, heterogeneity, design and implementation
patterns of contemporary phenotyping algorithms in the UK.
The concept of a minimum information standard has been
used successfully in other biomedical disciplines, e.g.
Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment
(MIAME) defines standards for reporting microarray
experiments [Brazma et al., 2001]. Establishing a
standardized method for representing phenotypes in the UK
can potentially address these challenges and ensure
compatibility with other international initiatives such as
eMERGE and PCORNet [Fleurence et al. 2014; Gottesman
et al. 2013].

Aims

Despite the widespread use of UK EHR data sources for
research, contemporary research resources utilize different
approaches for algorithm creation, curation and validation.
The aims of this study were to: a) identify and characterize
the structural components, implementation logic and
heterogeneity of rule-based algorithms defining diseases,
lifestyle risk factors and biomarkers in structured national
EHR in the UK utilized by contemporary research
resources, and b) propose a minimum information standard
to represent UK EHR phenotyping algorithms.

3.

Methods

We identified, downloaded and reviewed published
phenotyping algorithms for diseases, biomarkers and
lifestyle risk factors from two large-scale contemporary UK
research resources: UK Biobank1 and CALIBER2.
The UK Biobank [Sudlow et al., 2015] is a prospective
cohort study of 500,000 (aged 40-69 at recruitment) adults
recruited in England, Scotland and Wales from 2006-2010.
For each participant, deep phenotypic and genotypic
information is available including biomarkers in blood and
urine, imaging (brain, heart, abdomen, bone, carotid artery),
lifestyle indicators, pathophysiological measurements and
genome-wide genotype data. Follow-up for health outcomes
is enabled by hospital EHR (Hospital Episode Statistics
(HES) in England, Patient Episode Data Warehouse in
Wales and Scottish Morbidity Registry in Scotland) and
linkages to primary care EHR are underway. CALIBER
[Denaxas et al., 2012; Denaxas et al., 2019] is a research
resource consisting of algorithms, tools and methods for
structured EHR linked across primary care (Clinical Practice
Research Datalink, CPRD), hospital care (HES) and a
mortality data (Office for National Statistics, ONS) in the
UK.

In the UK, national EHR are recorded using controlled
clinical terminologies where terms are assigned at variable
timepoints i.e. in UK primary care the physician records
terms in real time during the consultation with the patient
whereas in hospital care terms are retrospectively entered
into databases by trained coders and data selected for billing
purposes. We identified and counted the number of ontology
terms each algorithm utilizes from five controlled clinical
terminologies which are widely used in the UK: a) Read
(primary care, subset of SNOMED-CT), b) International
Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th Revision (ICD-9,
ICD-10, secondary care diagnoses and cause of mortality),
c) OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures
(OPCS-4, hospital surgical procedures, analogous to the
Current Procedural Terminology ontology used in the
United States), and d) the Dictionary of Medicines and
Devices (DM+D) which is used to record primary care
prescriptions. Terms were automatically extracted from
documents and counted using regular expressions in Python
3.63. We manually extracted and counted terms across five
randomly chosen algorithms to verify the automaticallygenerated counts.
EHR phenotype validation is a critical process guiding the
subsequent use of algorithms and we were interested in what
types, if any, of evidence were available to external
researchers. We classified the available material into six
non-overlapping categories which encapsulate all potential
approaches for obtaining validity evidence (adapted from
[Denaxas et al, 2019] and recorded as used/not used):
• Aetiological: Are the prospective associations with risk
factors consistent with previous published evidence
from both EHR and non-EHR studies?
• Prognostic: Are the risks of subsequent events
plausible and consistent with existing domain
knowledge?
• Case-note review: What is the positive predictive value
(PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) when
comparing the algorithm with clinician-led review of
case notes, self-reported information or a suitable “gold
standard” source?
• Cross-EHR-source concordance: To what extent is
the phenotype concordant across EHR sources?
• Genetic: Are the observed genetic associations
plausible and consistent in terms of magnitude and
direction of association with associations reported from
non-EHR studies?
• External populations: Has the algorithm been
evaluated in different countries or external sources?
For each algorithm, we documented the EHR sources the
phenotype is derived from (i.e. primary care, hospital care,

representation components of phenotypes e.g. the presence
of tabular data and the use of a flowchart (or other graphical
presentation). We extracted and categorized information on
the different types of implementation logic, temporality and
algorithm implementation patterns (Table 1), partially based
on previous research in the US [Conway et al., 2011].

Results

We identified and reviewed 70 EHR phenotyping (Table 2)
algorithms available from the UK Biobank (n=19) and the
CALIBER resource (n=51). The majority of phenotyping
algorithms were created to ascertain disease status (n=54)
(e.g. heart failure [Gho et al. 2018; Uijl et al. 2019],
depression [Daskalopoulou et al. 2016]), ten algorithms
were created to extract information on biomarkers (e.g.
heart rate [Archangelidi et al. 2018], blood pressure
[Rapsomaniki et al. 2014]) and six algorithms were used to
identify lifestyle risk factors (e.g. alcohol [Bell et al. 2017],
smoking [Pujades-Rodriguez et al. 2015]).
All but one CALIBER phenotyping algorithm (n=50) used
information from primary care EHR with the exception of
socioeconomic status which was defined using the Index of
Multiple Deprivation (IMD) provided by the ONS.
Algorithms defining biomarker measurements (e.g. white
blood cells, heart rate) were based on primary care EHR
entirely while approximately half of the algorithms
ascertaining disease status (n=19 of 35) combined
information across all three EHR sources. All currently
available UK Biobank algorithms (n=19) combined
information recorded during the baseline assessment (data
not shown), diagnoses and/or surgical procedures recorded
during hospitalization and information based on the
underlying (or secondary) cause of death which is recorded
in the national mortality register. Primary care linkages in
UK Biobank are still underway and as a result none of the
currently available algorithms utilized information from
primary care EHR. However, primary care information for
just under half of the cohort (n=230,000) will be made
available for UK Biobank researchers in June 2019.
Algorithms incorporating primary care data for the
conditions already covered have been or are being
developed [Wilkinson et al 2019]. Along with a range of
additional algorithms expanding the range of health
outcomes available, they will be available from UK Biobank
later in 2019. Overall, based on current publicly available
information from CALIBER and UK Biobank, 75% (n=66)
of algorithms used data from secondary care EHR and 45%
(n=49) used information available in the death registry.
The most widely-used clinical terminology was Read with
4,729 (non-unique) terms used across all algorithms while
the second highest number of terms was derived from the
DM+D with 2,273 (non-unique) terms used to record
prescriptions in primary care EHR. Four algorithms (body
mass index, socioeconomic deprivation, sex, heart rate) did
not use any terms across any terminology systems and were
based on information which is derived from a structured
field of the EHR or externally linked such as in the case of
IMD. The atrial fibrillation algorithm used the highest

number of clinical terms (n=987) while across all algorithms
the pregnancy phenotype used the highest number of Read
codes (n=1,948). ICD-9 was the terminology least used: in
the UK Biobank it is used for recording diagnoses in older
Scottish hospital records and in CALIBER it is used to
record the cause of death prior to 1997. Algorithms defining
biomarkers contained the lowest number of terminology
terms as they relied on structured data fields combined with
a small number of diagnosis terms to denote the type of test
(e.g. Read code “42K..00 Eosinophil count”).
With regards to algorithm implementation logic, 66 (93%)
of algorithms used Boolean statements, usually to identify
the presence of one or more diagnosis codes in a patient’s
EHR. Where Boolean statements were deployed, in nearly
half of the cases these were complex and involved either a
series of nested statements or joined information across
multiple sources, for example in the UK Biobank where
information is derived from self-reported, hospital and
mortality sources and events are further stratified as
‘prevalent’ (first reported prior to recruitment) or ‘incident’
(first reported after recruitment). A similar pattern of logic
was observed with regards to temporality where 66
algorithms utilized temporal rules and almost always this
included more complex statements and restrictions. Finally,
approximately half (n=43) of the algorithms used negation.
Only ten algorithms (16%) included more complex
calculations, usually to calculate the mean of multiple
measurements on the same day or to harmonize units for
laboratory measurements to a common format.

and temporal logic. When these are used, they are often
complex i.e. combining multiple nested Boolean layers of
logic and defining temporal proximity rules within them.
This is expected given that algorithms utilize multiple
sources of information and include evidence from primary
care and hospital care (or self-reported information in the
case of the UK Biobank). Algorithms defining disease status
were the most frequent and complex algorithms reviewed
and utilized the greatest number of terms from controlled
clinical terminologies. Negation was another major
component of algorithms and is often used to exclude
concomitant diagnoses or procedures when trying to
ascertain diseases based on secondary information (e.g.
ascertaining AF cases based on a prescription of digoxin but
excluding patients which are diagnosed with HF).
The Read clinical terminology was the most popular
terminology used with the highest number of terms per
phenotype. These findings are expected as Read contains a
significant amount of duplication internally due to synonym
terms which can be potentially utilized. Additionally, the
clinical concepts contained within Read subsume the
concepts across all other terminologies i.e. Read contains
terms for diagnoses, symptoms, laboratory tests,
prescriptions and procedures. UK primary care clinical
coding is currently transitioning to SNOMED-CT which
should provide a more streamlined set of terms to be used.

5. Discussion

In terms of validation, we observed a significant level of
heterogeneity with approaches seeking to evaluate and
replicate previously reported aetiological and prognostic
estimates from non-EHR studies being the most popular.
The presentation of the evidence however does not follow a
common standard and sometimes only included references
to published research rather than a more structured abstract
of the main findings of the analyses. In contrast with the
US, expert review of case records was the least frequently
used approach for evaluation due to the fact that large scale
corpuses of medical text do not exist in the UK owing to
information governance restrictions and the technical
challenges of integrating such data since they are held in a
wide range of formats by multiple different NHS
organisations. For similar reasons, none of the algorithms
reviewed utilize medical text and natural language
processing approaches to extract information from medical
notes which is prevalent in some clinical specialties such as
mental health [Wu et al. 2018].

In this study we downloaded and reviewed 70 EHR
phenotyping algorithms from two large-scale, national
research resources in the UK. We reviewed algorithms in
terms of EHR data sources, controlled clinical terminologies
used, available evidence of algorithm validation, algorithm
representation formats and implementation logic patterns.

Significant heterogeneity was also observed in terms of
representation. UK Biobank algorithms were curated in
individual PDF files4 and included extended information on
the goal of the algorithm and useful background knowledge
and references. In contrast, CALIBER phenotypes were

Prognostic 86% (n=66) and cross-source concordance 54%
(n=43) validation approaches where the most widely-used
algorithm evaluation approaches. The least-widely used
validation approach was expert case note review, although
this type of validation has been completed for a few UK
Biobank algorithms, including dementia and its subtypes
[Wilkinson et al, 2019], and is underway for several others.
Most (93% [n=66]) of the algorithms used data stored in
tabular format since tables are predominantly used to store
lists of controlled clinical terminology terms. Only 25%
(n=15) of algorithms included a graphical representation of
the algorithm using a flowchart and all algorithms included
a textual description of the algorithm components.

Similar to findings from US studies, we discovered that UK
EHR algorithms make extensive use of Boolean statements

stored in an online, openly-available Portal5, spanned
multiple pages and did not include much background
information. Flowcharts or similar graphical representations
were not widely-used and while they are not machinereadable, they can potentially minimize errors during
translation of the algorithm to machine code.
Our study has potential limitations. We reviewed algorithms
from only two UK sources. While other UK initiatives exist,
they tend to focus on curating lists of controlled clinical
terminology terms (referred to as codelists) rather than selfcontained phenotypes i.e. terms, implementation, validation
evidence. We only focused on rule-based approaches and
did not cover machine learning approaches. While rulebased methods are the most widely used in the UK, datadriven high-throughput approaches including natural
language processing methods are emerging [Zhou et al.,
2016, Pikoula et al., 2019]. These approaches pose different
challenges and their requirements would need to be
documented and analysed in order to ensure their integration
[Hripcsak & Albers 2013]. Finally, reproducible research
approaches [Denaxas et al., 2017, Goodman et al, 2016]
which are covered elsewhere would also need to be
carefully taken into consideration in order to ensure
algorithm portability.

6. Steps towards a minimum information standard
Based on our findings, we propose that an EHR
phenotyping algorithm representation combines metadata,
implementation logic, validation evidence and use-cases.
We suggest the following components towards establishing
a minimum information standard with regards to rule-based
phenotyping algorithms for UK EHR:
Part 1 – Algorithm metadata: Succinct information about
the goal of the algorithm, the intended use-case, the data
sources and controlled clinical terminologies used,
applicable age groups and genders, list of authors and their
contact details and a set of SNOMED-CT terms to classify
the algorithm. A unique identifier, such as a Digital Object
Identifier (DOI), should be minted to enable usage tracking
in subsequent research.
Part 2 – Implementation: Details on the implementation
logic of the algorithm with pseudocode to facilitate the
translation to machine code and documentation on decisions
made and reasoning. Where possible analytical scripts
should be attached using markdown or a similar approach.
The standard should support defining complex Boolean and
temporal logic across multiple EHR sources and clinical
terminologies. In the future, a computable phenotype format
should encapsulate this information as a stand-alone file.

Part 3 – Validation evidence: Description of the steps
taken to support phenotype validity across six categories
(aetiological, prognostic, genetic, expert review, crosssource and external population). For each implementation,
the number of cases, controls, NPV and PPV values should
be reported and the format should support the embedding of
graphical files (e.g. forest plots).
Part 4 – Use-cases: Links to published research utilizing
the phenotype algorithms, cross-referenced with DOI’s.

7. Conclusion
Our analyses identified a certain level of underlying
homogeneity in terms of how phenotyping algorithms are
defined and evaluated. We suggest four components
towards a minimum information standard that should be
used to represent phenotyping algorithms. These findings
provide a crucial first step towards curating and
disseminating phenotyping algorithms utilizing UK EHR.
Further work is required towards establishing a computable
format for phenotyping algorithms and ensuring
interoperability with other resources (e.g. PheKB).
