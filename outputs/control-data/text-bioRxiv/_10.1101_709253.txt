ABSTRACT

26

Saccharomyces eubayanus represents missing cryotolerant ancestor of lager yeast hybrid

27

and can be found in Patagonia in association with Nothofagus forests. The limited number

28

of isolates and associated genomes available has prevented to resolve the S. eubayanus

29

origin and evolution. Here, we present a sampling effort at an unprecedented scale and

30

report the isolation of 160 strains from ten sampling sites along 2,000 km distance in South

31

America. We sequenced the genome of 82 strains and, together with other 25 available

32

genomes, performed comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. Our results revealed the

33

presence of three main Patagonia-B lineages together with dozens of admixed strains

34

distributed in three mosaic clusters. The PB-1 lineage isolated from Tierra del Fuego

35

exhibited the highest genetic diversity, lowest LD blocks and highest Fis values compared

36

to the other lineages, suggesting a successful adaptation to cold temperatures in extreme

37

environments and greater inbreeding rates in Tierra del Fuego. Differences between

38

lineages and strains were found in terms of aneuploidy and pangenome content, evidencing

39

a lateral gene transfer event in PB-2 strains from an unknown donor species. Overall, the

40

Patagonian lineages, particularly southern populations, showed a greater global genetic

41

diversity compared to Holarctic and Chinese lineages, supporting the scenario of a S.

42

eubayanus colonization from Patagonia and then spread towards northern and western

43

regions, including the Holarctic (North America and China) and New Zealand. Interestingly,

44

fermentative capacity and maltose consumption resulted negatively correlated with latitude,

45

indicating a better fermentative performance in norther populations. Our genome analysis

46

together with previous reports in the sister species S. uvarum strongly suggests that the S.

47

eubayanus ancestor could have originated in Patagonia or the Southern Hemisphere, rather

48

than China, yet further studies are needed to resolve this conflicting scenario. Understanding

49

S. eubayanus evolutionary history is crucial to resolve the unknown origin of the lager yeast

50

and might open new avenues for biotechnological applications.

INTRODUCTION

52

There are at least 1,500 species of yeasts, which can be found on a broad range of

53

substrates including fruit skin, cacti exudates and soil, where they can be either inert or

54

pathogenic (Guz 2011). Some species from the Saccharomycotina subphylum have

55

developed the ability to ferment simple sugars from fruits to produce alcohol. In this way,

56

fermentation became a key innovation that led to the diversification of fermentative yeasts

57

about 100 million years ago (MYA), coinciding with the appearance of Angiosperms (Piskur

58

et al. 2006; Dashko et al. 2014). The monophyletic Saccharomyces genus is currently

59

composed of eight distinct species (Dujon and Louis 2017), including the partially

60

domesticated S. cerevisiae and other non-domesticated species, such as S. eubayanus

61

(Borneman and Pretorius 2015). This clade contains some of the most important species

62

involved in alcohol and bread fermentation, likely due to their ability to grow in the absence

63

of oxygen (anaerobic fermentation)(Hagman et al. 2013). Given the economic importance

64

of this clade, as well as the wealth of genomic information that has been produced in the

65

past decade, particularly for the model organism S. cerevisiae (Liti et al. 2009; Schacherer

66

et al. 2009; Gallone et al. 2016; Goncalves et al. 2016; Legras et al. 2018; Peter et al. 2018),

67

natural populations of Saccharomyces are excellent models for understanding genome

68

evolution and adaptation in the wild.

69

S. cerevisiae was the first sequenced eukaryote, and recently the large amount of isolates

70

in this species and associated genomic data provide exceptional new insights into the

71

genomic processes that drive environmental adaptation and genome evolution between

72

isolates (Yue et al. 2017; Legras et al. 2018; Peter et al. 2018). Given the feasibility to rapidly

73

and cost-effectively sequence full genomes, other Saccharomyces genomes have been fully

74

obtained (Dujon and Louis 2017). Saccharomyces species harbour different genetic

75

structures, population histories and unique phenotypic properties. Despite these advances,

76

the number of isolates for which both fully annotated genomes and phenotypic data are

77

available is still low. In many cases, only a handful of isolates from a species have been

78

studied and therefore the identification of genomic features responsible for local adaptation

79

and evolutionary changes is less well documented compared to S. cerevisaie, limiting the

80

understanding of adaptation processes in the genus.

81

In nature, several Saccharomyces inter-species hybrids have been found. An example of

82

this includes the workhorse of the modern brewing industry, S. pastorianus, a hybrid

83

between S. cerevisiae and the cold-tolerant S. eubayanus (Baker et al. 2015; Krogerus et

84

al. 2017). Despite the industrial importance of S. pastorianus, much of the natural history of

85

this hybrid remains obscure, largely because the S. eubayanus parental strain was only

86

recently isolated (Libkind et al. 2011). The combination of precise alleles gives the hybrid S.

87

pastorianus a series of competitive advantages in the fermentative environment. For

88

example, efficient maltotriose utilization was inherited from S. cerevisiae, while fermentation

89

at low temperatures and maltose utilization is the legacy of the cryotolerant S. eubayanus

90

(Hebly et al. 2015; Krogerus et al. 2017; Brickwedde et al. 2018; Eizaguirre et al. 2018;

91

Baker et al. 2019). Providing a unique fermentation profile for brewing, S. eubayanus can

92

efficiently grow at a lower range of temperatures (4°C – 25°C) compared to S. cerevisiae,

93

however the genetic basis of this advantage is yet unknown (Baker et al. 2015). S.

94

eubayanus was originally isolated from Nothofagus trees in the Argentinian Patagonia

95

(Libkind et al. 2011) and since then it has been isolated in New Zealand (Gayevskiy and

96

Goddard 2016), North America (Peris et al. 2014) and East Asia (Bing et al. 2014). However,

97

the evolutionary origin of S. eubayanus is still controversial. While this species has been

98

isolated from South American Nothofagus trees recurrently (Eizaguirre et al. 2018) and only

99

a handful of isolates have been recovered from trees in China and North America (Bing et

100

al. 2014; Peris et al. 2016), a subset of the strains from China have been reported as the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/709253; this version posted July 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

101

earliest diverging lineage, suggesting an Asian origin of the species (Bing et al. 2014),

102

although these findings have been challenged (Eizaguirre et al. 2018).

103

Molecular profiling indicates that S. eubayanus is composed of three populations, besides

104

the early diverging lineage of West China. These populations include a ‘Holarctic’ cluster (a

105

group of related strains from Tibet and North America) and two Patagonian populations

106

denominated: ‘Patagonia A’ and ‘Patagonia B’ (Peris et al. 2016). The populations, can be

107

further divided into six subpopulations, denominated: PB-1, PB-2, PB-3, Holarctic, PA-1 &

108

PA-2 (Peris et al. 2016; Eizaguirre et al. 2018). Whole genome sequence comparison

109

among wild S. eubayanus strains indicate that, thus far, the Holarctic lineage is the closest

110

relative of the lager yeast (Peris et al. 2016; Eizaguirre et al. 2018). Interestingly, multi-locus

111

sequence comparisons have indicated that the nucleotide diversity of S. eubayanus

112

Patagonian populations is greater than that of the West China and the Holarctic (North

113

American) lineages, suggesting a greater colonization success in South America (Peris et

114

al. 2016). However, until now only a handful of S. eubayanus genomes per population have

115

been fully sequenced preventing a detailed population genomics portrait.

116

Here, we isolated 160 S. eubayanus strains from bark samples obtained from Nothofagus

117

trees in Chile and we provide annotated genomes together with phenotypic characterization

118

for 82 selected strains. We investigated the genetic structure and nucleotide diversity of this

119

set of strains and re-analyzed other 23 previously published genomes. Overall, we provide

120

evidence of a population structure in Patagonia that greatly expands previously known

121

genetic structure in this region. Moreover, phenotypic clustering correlated well with genetic

122

distances, where individuals from northern sites showed greater fermentation performance

123

and high temperature tolerance than isolates from southern sites. The genomic data

124

presented here broadens our knowledge of the genetics, ecology, and evolution of wild

125

Saccharomyces strains.

RESULTS

127

S. eubayanus isolation and whole genome sequencing

128

In order to determine the presence and distribution of S. eubayanus isolates along the south

129

western side of the Andes Mountains (which is within the Chilean territory), we sampled ten

130

national parks and reserves between 2017 and 2018. The sites sampled correspond to

131

primary forest spanning 2,090 km from Altos de Lircay National Park in central Chile (VII

132

Maule Region, Chile) to Karukinka Natural Park in southern Chile (XII Magallanes Region,

133

Chile) (Figure 1A). From these sites, we obtained 553 bark samples from Nothofagus and

134

Araucaria trees, primordially N. pumilio, N. antarctica, N. dombeyi and A. araucana.

135

Raffinose and ethanol media enrichment (Cubillos et al. 2019) allowed us to recover yeast

136

colonies in 77% of the samples. Potential Saccharomyces strains were identified by

137

sequencing the ITS and/or GSY1 and RPI1 RFLP (Peris et al. 2014; Peris et al. 2016). From

138

these, 160 S. eubayanus strains were identified from different individual trees (Table S1,

139

representing 28.9% of the samples), and in parallel, another set of 179 S. uvarum isolates

140

were recovered (representing 37.9% of the samples), together with dozens of non-

141

Saccharomyces species belonging to the Lachancea, Kregervanrija, Kazachstania and

142

Hanseniaspora genera. Preliminary genotyping using GSY1 RFLP analysis (Peris et al.

143

2014; Peris et al. 2016) suggested that all isolates belong to the PB lineage, except for

144

isolate CL609.1 which showed a PA restriction pattern (data not shown). In general, we

145

observed a pattern between yeasts and hosts, where N. pumilio and N. antarctica contained

146

mostly S. eubayanus strains, while all but one isolate derived from N. dombeyi and A.

147

araucana samples were identified as S. uvarum (Table S1). Moreover, the frequency of

148

yeast isolates was higher towards southern regions (from Villarrica to Torres del Paine),

149

where up to 90% of the bark samples yielded yeast colonies, and most of these belonged

150

to the Saccharomyces genus (Figure 1B). On the contrary, a lower fraction of yeast colonies

151

was obtained from Tierra del Fuego, likely due to the extreme environmental conditions

152

found in this region. Overall, our results demonstrate the high frequency of the S. eubayanus

153

species after latitude 33° in the western side of the Andes Mountains.

162

To investigate the genomic variation and population structure of the S. eubayanus isolates,

163

we sequenced the whole genomes of 82 strains, randomly selected, from the ten sampling

164

sites using Illumina sequencing technology. Furthermore, to explore the genomic diversity

165

across the entire geographic range of this species, we combined our dataset with all

166

previously published genome from 23 strains obtained from the North America (9 strains),

167

Argentina (10 strains) (Peris et al. 2016), China (1 strain) (Bing et al. 2014), New Zealand

168

(1 strain) (Gayevskiy and Goddard 2016) and two lager genomes (Baker et al. 2015),

169

maximising the geographical dispersal of the species. In parallel, FACS analysis revealed

170

that all samples were diploids, except for CL609.1 and CL1005.1 that were found as haploid

171

and tetraploid respectively (Figure S1). Indeed, all strains were able to sporulate, with the

172

exception of CL609.1 (data not-shown).

173

On average, we obtained 25.9 million reads per sample, which were aligned against the

174

CBS12357T type strain reference genome (Brickwedde et al. 2018). From this, we obtained

175

an average coverage of 164X, ranging from 17X to 251X (Table S2). A total of 229,272

176

single nucleotide polymorphisms, together with 19,982 insertions and deletions were found

177

across the 82 S. eubayanus genomes collected in this study. The number of SNPs per strain

178

ranged from 28,420 to 76,320 with strains CL619.1 and CL609.1 representing both extremes

179

and which were isolated from Osorno Volcano and Puyehue neighbouring isolation sites,

180

respectively (Table S2a). Overall, no strain isolated in this study represents a close relative

181

to the type strain (obtained from Argentina), suggesting that the Andes Mountains

182

represents a natural barrier between S. eubayanus populations (Table S2b). On average,

183

across the 82 genomes we obtained 39,024 SNPs per strain relative to the reference

184

genome, and a SNP was found on average every ~300 bp. In parallel, we found on average

185

1,606 insertions and 1,677 deletions per isolate relative to the type strain. These results

186

demonstrate that Chilean S. eubayanus populations are genetically distinct from those

187

described in Argentina and world-wide.

188

Population structure and admixed isolates

189

To examine whether the collected isolates comprise one panmictic population or various

190

genetically distinct populations, we generated a neighbour joining phylogenetic tree based

191

on 590,909 polymorphic sites (Figure 2A). The phylogeny obtained demonstrates that

192

Chilean strains displayed different ancestry and mostly fell into three major clades:

193

Patagonia B1 (PB-1), B2 (PB-2) & B3 (PB-3), each containing 31, 16, 25 strains,

194

respectively. Nine strains fell outside the major PB lineage and might represent admixed

195

strains (‘SoAm’). Also, one strain shares a recent common ancestor with the PA cluster

196

suggesting that this strain might be a hybrid of the PB and PA lineages (Figure 2B). Each

197

clade tends to contain strains obtained from neighbouring localities, suggesting a strong

198

influence of geography on genetic differentiation. For example, strains obtained from

199

southern (Coyhaique, Torres del Paine, Magallanes, Karukinka) and south-central Chile

200

(Osorno Volcano) clustered in PB-1. Strains from central Chile (Altos de Lircay, Nahuelbuta

201

and Villarrica) clustered in PB-2, and some strains from south-central Chile also clustered

202

in PB-3 (Villarrica, Puyehue, Choshuenco, and Osorno Volcano). Interestingly, no isolates

203

belonging to Patagonia A were found in Chile, and only a single isolate (CL609.1 from

204

Puyehue) clustered near the PA branch, yet outside of this lineage.

205

To investigate the ancestry, we explored population structure using STRUCTURE. For this,

206

we selected 9,885 SNPs evenly distributed across the whole genome. Among our analyzed

207

strains, we identified three groups exhibiting different levels of mosaic or admixed genomes.

208

This analysis indicated an optimum k = 5 groups (K5 = 2,652, Figure S2, Table S3),

209

highlighted by the presence of three main Patagonia B populations in Chile (Figure 2B).

210

Furthermore, sequence similarity using SNP data and principal component analysis (PCA)

211

on the Patagonian populations validated the presence of three groups in addition to the

212

Argentinian Patagonia A cluster (Figure S3). Most localities contained isolates belonging to

213

one lineage and/or admixed groups, excepting for Villarrica and Osorno Volcano localities

214

which harbour at least two lineages and/or admixed set of strains, representing sympatric

215

geographic regions (Figure 2C). Overall, the phylogenomic, STRUCTURE and PCA

216

analyses indicate that the S. eubayanus Patagonia-B clade found in Chile can be subdivided

217

into three different lineages, PB-1, PB-2 & PB-3. Moreover, three groups of admixed strains

218

(SoAm 1-3) were found, that together with the North American (NoAm), Holarctic and PA

219

lineages shape the genetic structure of S. eubayanus.

220

In order to gain insight into the historical recombination events that affected the PB clade,

221

we estimated linkage disequilibrium decay. Estimates of LD based on r2 values differed

222

between the three PB lineages (Figure 2D). In particular, relatively low LD values were

223

observed for all populations, but the maximum r2 and the rates of decay differed among

224

populations. LD was detected over larger distances in the PB-3 and PB-2 populations, while

225

LD decreased rapidly with increasing distance for the PB-1 population. Lineages showed a

226

50% LD decay of 2.9 kb, 29.1 kb and 22.5 kb in the PB-1, PB-2 and PB-3 populations,

227

respectively, demonstrating a population-specific LD decay and greater recombination

228

levels in the PB-1 population.

in our collection (E). Genome-wide ancestry for admixed strains. Bins of 100 SNPs were assigned in
the admixed strains to the populations PB-1 (red), PB-2 (green), PB-3 (yellow) or PA (blue) based on
sequence similarity.

247
248

This could be explained by greater inbreeding or outbreeding rates in the clade. Indeed, Fis

249

values (Wright’s inbreeding coefficient) were significantly higher (p-value < 0.001, paired

250

Student t-test) in PB-1 (average Fis = 0.9482 CI = 0.9462 - 0.9503), compared to PB-2 and

251

PB-3 (average Fis = 0.9017 (CI = 0.8974 - 0.906 & Fis = 0.8856 CI = 0.8795 - 0.8916,

252

respectively), suggesting high inbreeding ratios in these populations (Table S3b). Moreover,

253

the PB-1 level of recombination was similar to what is described in domesticated S.

254

cerevisiae populations (Liti et al. 2009; Peter et al. 2018).

255

To determine how recombination events influenced the genomes of admixed strains and the

256

level of genetic exchange between populations, we explored their mosaic genome

257

compositions and genetic origins. Consequently, we generated similarity plots using 100

258

SNPs blocks and determined the closest genetic origin for each of the three groups of

259

admixed strains from each population. The most interesting strain corresponds to CL609.1,

260

which is a hybrid strain between the PA (58%), PB-1 (20%) and PB-3 (22%) lineages, where

261

different segments fall into each lineage (Figure 2E). Admixed strains clustering nearby the

262

PB-3 lineage represented another example where mosaic genomes between lineages were

263

found. These strains could represent hybrids between PB-1 and PB-3, and most of these

264

strains share the same regions from each population, and therefore suggesting a common

265

ancestor (Figure 2E). Similarly, two admixed strains between PB-1 & PB-2 from Nahuelbuta

266

showed different proportions of blocks of origins. While 79% of the genome of CL1106.1 is

267

most similar to PB-2, 54% of the genome of CL1112.1 is most similar to genomes of

268

individuals pertaining to PB-1. Similarly, the P1C1 strain from New Zealand corresponds to

269

a hybrid originated from PB-1 & PB-2 lineages, while North American strains hybrids

270

between PB-1 & PB-3, likely suggesting a migration out from Tierra del Fuego and the

271

Patagonia. These results demonstrate the constant outcrossing and admixture between

272

subpopulations and the success of the PB-1 branch by contributing to all of the admixed

273

genomes analysed in our study.

274
275

Highest nucleotide diversity in Tierra del Fuego populations

276

Characterizing patterns of genetic variation at the whole-genome level among populations

277

can provide insights into signatures of selection (Hoban et al. 2016). Therefore, we

278

calculated nucleotide diversity (, which corresponds to the average number of nucleotide

279

differences between individuals per site), genetic differentiation (FST), and neutrality test

280

statistics: Tajima’s D, Fu and Li's D, and Fu's F (Table S3B). Genome-wide nucleotide

281

diversity () differed among PB populations (Figure 3A). PB-1 was more genetically diverse

282

population (π= 0.00166750) than PB-2 (π= 0.000959206) and PB-3 (π= 0.000591578).

283

These results are in agreement with PB-1 faster LD decay results and the broader

284

geographic range where this clade is found. Interestingly, samples collected in Coyhaique

285

showed the highest nucleotide diversity (), in agreement with a high abundance of isolates

286

in this locality (Figure 3B). Indeed, southern localities belonging to PB-1 showed

287

significantly greater scores compared to the other two lineages, thus in our study PB-1

288

represents the most genetically diverse population (Figure 3). On the other hand, PB-3

289

isolates from Choshuenco and Villarrica, located further north had the lowest levels of

genetic diversity (Figure 3B). These results demonstrate a positive and significant (p-value

291

< 0.05, Spearman correlation coefficient rs = 0.632) correlation between latitude and genetic

292

diversity, i.e. the more southern the sampling the higher the genetic diversity found, and this

293

is likely influenced by greater N. pumilio dispersal towards southern regions (Figure 3C).

301

Subsequently, we estimated Tajima’s D values (measured as the deviation between

302

pairwise differences and segregating sites). Tajima’s D’ scores differed between clades.

303

Specifically, Tajima’s D for PB-2 & PB-3 were positive while this metric was nearly neutral

304

for PB-1, suggesting balancing selection in the former case and neutral selection for the

305

latest (Table S3b). To determine if the pattern of D’ scores was consistent across the whole

306

genome, we plotted the Tajima's D values along the genome for every 100 SNPs in non-

307

overlapping windows. Interestingly, PB-3 showed a greater number of regions with positive

308

Tajima's D scores (>1) compared to the other two clades. This suggests that balancing

309

selection may maintain allelic diversity in these regions (Figure S4).

310

The obtained FST values suggest that these populations are genetically different (p-value <

311

0.0001, Figure S5, Table S4). Our genome-wide analysis allowed us to find only a handful

312

of regions sharing low Tajima's D values between clades, yet all but one region in

313

chromosome V exhibited high FST values. This genomic island found between PB-1 and PB-

314

2 exhibited low Tajima's D values and extremely low FST values (Figure S4B & Figure S5),

315

suggesting a common genetic ancestry. This region contained four genes: IRC22, MNN1,

316

NOP16 and PMI40. From GO term analysis we found enrichment for ‘glycosilation’ process,

317

due to the presence of PMI40 and MNN1, the former encoding for an essential mannose-6-

318

phosphate isomerase that catalyses the interconversion of fructose-6-P and mannose-6-P,

319

while the latest encoding for an Alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase. These results suggest that

320

glycosilation could be under selection in these two populations.

321

We then assessed the degree of genetic differentiation and nucleotide diversity between the

322

ten sampling sites per lineage. We found moderate to high significant FST values ranging

323

from 0.16 to 0.88 (Table S4). Torres del Paine and Magallanes, two localities clustering in

324

PB-1 and separated by ~ 200 km had the lowest FST values, while Villarrica and Altos de

325

Lircay (separated by 400 km) were the most genetically differentiated (Table S4). A mantel

326

test showed a significant correlation between the geographic and the genetic distances

327

(isolation by distance, p-value < 0.05) among sampling sites of the PB-1 lineage. The

328

number of pairwise comparisons was insufficient to test for IBD for lineages PB-2 and PB-

329

3. The positive IBD for PB-1 indicates limited effective dispersal within this lineage (Figure

330

S6).

331
332

Pangenome and genome content variation

333

In order to compare the genome content, we constructed the pangenome across all isolates.

334

We identified 5,497 non redundant pangenomic ORFs in the species. Out of these, 5,233

335

ORFs are core systematically present in all of the isolates, while 264 are dispensable, being

336

only found in subsets of strains. A PCA analysis of the presence/absence profile of these

337

ORFs was used to visualize potential overlap between genome content similarities and

338

SNPs distance (Figure 4). In partial concordance with the phylogenetic tree, the branch

339

harbouring the Chinese isolate, which also contained two North American isolates,

340

represented the most divergent clade. The common grouping of Chinese and North

341

American isolates together with their sequence similarity, suggests a recent migration event

342

between Asia and America. Clear genetic differences were also found between PB-3 and

343

the other clades. This suggests reduced admixture of these genomes, but a relatively recent

344

separation. On the other hand, isolates from PB-1 and PB-2 distribute close to each other

345

representing two halves of the same cluster, which can either suggest an extremely recent

346

separation between the two clades, or continuous admixture. Interestingly, in our analysis

347

PA isolates were extremely close to the PB-1 isolates, indicating extensive overlapping in

348

genome content.

To identify potential lateral gene transfer (LGT) events from other species, we compared the

Figure 4. PCA of the gene’s presence-absence profiles. (A) Principal component analyses of the
first three components show a reasonable level of concordance between sequence variation and
genome content difference. Chinese/North American branch can be easily separated from the South
American clades. Only non-mosaic 83 isolates from all populations were considered. (B) Principal
component analyses considering only PB populations. Middle positioning of PB-1 mirrors the shape
of the un-rooted phylogenetic tree based on the sequence divergence (Fig.2A). Interestingly, the PB3 is the most separated clade, suggesting a lower level of outbreeding, while a partial overlap can be
identified between the other clades.

361
362

We identified nine ORFs present in a group of nine closely related isolates belonging to the

363

PB-2 clade (CL248.1, CL701.1, CL702.1, CL705.1, CL710.1, CL711.1, CL715.1, CL910.1

364

and CL915.1), and six of the strains were isolated from the same locality and were

365

assembled within a single contig for each isolate (S. eubayanus Region A). In two of these

366

isolates (CL701.1 and CL248.1) these ORFs appear to be duplicated. SMART was used to

367

identify known PFAM protein domains. These comprise putative proteins with an arginase

368

domain, a MFS_1 (Major facilitator superfamily), a membrane transport protein domain, a

369

Fungal specific transcription factor domain, a Gal4-like dimerization domain and a

370

transmembrane one (Figure S7). In addition to these high-confidence hits, a search for

371

homologies, also performed using SMART, indicated the presence of potential glucosidase

372

domain in four of the other ORFs and a homing endonuclease on another one (Figure S7).

373

The absence of matches from a search in the NCBI non-redundant database suggest the

374

presence of orphan genes from an external un-sequenced donor species.

375

Furthermore, we also identified 64 private ORFs in the Chinese/North American clade. Out

376

of 64 such ORFs, at least 20 correspond to orthologs of other genes found in S. eubayanus

377

(showing an identity percentage between 94% and 76%). For the majority of such ORFs no

378

potential donor species has been found. That being said, one of these ORFs was identified

379

as a MALS gene which encodes for a maltase enzyme also found in S. uvarum x S.

380

eubayanus hybrids (S. bayanus). These ORFs are not found clustered together, but rather

381

scattered across several contigs in the assemblies. A phylogenetic analyses performed

382

gene by gene indicates the potential donor species to have an intermediate distance

383

between S. eubayanus and S. arboricola, although the presence of more than one donor

384

cannot be categorically excluded. It is possible that different subset of these ORFs have

385

different evolutionary origins. Among these ORFs, we could also find ancestral segregating

386

genes, paralogs of other S. eubayanus genes and lost in the lineage from which the South

387

American clades originated.

Phenotypic diversity among S. eubayanus isolates

S. eubayanus phenotypic diversity was assessed in a set of 88 isolates, representative of

391

the different clades found across the American continent. High-resolution growth

392

quantification was conducted under eight environmental conditions. These conditions

393

included different growth temperatures, salt resistance, glucose and maltose utilization and

394

antimicrobial compounds. Three growth variables were extracted: the lag phase, growth rate

395

(max) and maximum OD (maxOD) (Table S7a) generating phenotypic data for 24 attributes

396

from the growth curves. We found a significant correlation between max and maxOD, and

397

therefore we focused on these two as fitness parameters and compared them across

398

isolates & conditions. We found that bivariate correlations among traits vary considerably

399

(Table S7b). For example, the conditions NaCl, and CuSO4 showed a positive max

400

correlation (Pearson r = 0.47, p-value < 6 x 10-9), where both traits likely share similar

401

molecular pathways (Dhar et al. 2013). Conversely, there was no significant max

402

correlation between NaCl and Hygromycin resistance (Pearson r = 0.12, p-value = 0.14).

403

NaCl and 34°C represented the two phenotypes exhibiting the greatest phenotypic

404

coefficients of variation (47% and 62%) for max and maxOD, respectively, suggesting

405

ecological niche differentiation and mutation accumulation in these polygenic traits across

406

the strains.

407

We then generated a clustered heat map of the phenotypic correlations between yeast

408

isolates across all traits for max (Figure 5). Phenotypic clustering was mostly driven by

409

geography, rather than by genetic relationship. North American Holarctic strains clustered

410

separately and showed low max and maxOD scores across traits. The CBS12357T strain

411

clustered together with PB-1 strains from Torres del Paine. This clustering was further

412

supported by the principal component analysis, both of which produced the main groups

413

split by localities, rather than lineages, where only PB-2 isolates grouped together (Figure

414

S8). Specifically, only for certain phenotypes we found differences among localities (Table

415

S8).

422

For example, northern isolates obtained from Altos de Lircay and Nahuelbuta had greater

423

max when grown at high temperatures (34°C) than isolates from other localities (p-value <

424

0.05, Tukey test). This suggests that northern isolates might be adapted to warmer climates.

425

Altogether, our results demonstrate a relatively low phenotypic diversity across traits and

426

strains, and most of this diversity can be explained by habitat adaptation rather than by

427

phylogenetic history.

428
429

Isolates from lower latitudes exhibit greater fermentation performance

430

Given the importance of S. eubayanus in lager brewing, we then evaluated the fermentation

431

performance of the same set of strains previously phenotyped and used the W34/70 lager

432

strain as fermentation positive control. The conditions included 12°P wort at 12°C in 50 mL

433

(micro-fermentations batches). For this, CO2 loss was recorded every day and metabolite

434

consumption (glucose, fructose, maltose and maltotriose) and production (glycerol and

435

ethanol) was estimated at the end of the fermentation process. In all cases, the lager control

436

showed better fermentation performance compared to the majority of S. eubayanus isolates

437

(p-value < 0.05, t-test, Table S9a), except for five strains from Altos de Lircay and Villarrica.

438

This strains showed not-significantly differences in CO2 lost levels compared to the lager

439

control (p-value > 0.05, Student test), demonstrating the greater beer fermentation potential

440

of these strains. Overall, we observed that isolates obtained at lower latitudes (Central

441

region) lost significantly greater CO2 levels than individuals obtained at higher latitudes

442

(extreme South). For example, Magallanes isolates belonging to PB-1 showed 2X lower

443

fermentation performance than isolates obtained from Altos de Lircay (PB-2), which are

444

separated by approximately 1,800 km (Table S9b). Indeed, we found a significant

445

correlation (Pearson r = 0.566, p-value < 0.001) when we compared latitude vs CO2 lost

446

(Figure 6A) and significant differences between localities (Table S9b). Furthermore, we

447

found that fermentation performance was directly correlated with maltose sugar

448

consumption (Pearson r = 0.52, p-value < 6 x 10-8, Table S10, Figure 6B), and ethanol

449

production (Pearson r = 0.56, p-value < 2 x 10-6).

461

In order to determine the molecular basis of differences in maltose consumption and

462

fermentation performance, we evaluated the impact of polymorphisms and indels within the

463

AGT1 gene. This gene encodes for a high-affinity maltose and maltrotriose transporter in S.

464

pastorianus and is responsible for the maltotriose consumption under fermentative

465

conditions (Nakao et al. 2009). Three copies along the reference genome were found in

466

chromosomes V (DI49_1597), XIII (DI49_3958) and XVI (DI49_5193), exhibiting a sequence

467

identity above 55% and hereafter denominated as AGT1_V, AGT1_XIII and AGT1_XVI. In

468

fact, analysing sequence variation across strains revealed that phylogenetic trees differed

469

between AGT1 copies (Figure S9A). Interestingly, we found that some strains do not carry

470

all three functional copies of the Agt1 protein. This loss of function is caused by deletions

471

that generate truncated proteins. For the AGT1_V encoded transporter, truncation occurs

472

after 50 aminoacids, for the AGT1_XIII encoded transporter it occurs after 180 aminoacids,

473

and for the AGT1_XVI encoded transporter it occurs after 293 aminoacids (Figure S9B).

474

Interestingly, PB-2 isolates did not carry any of the truncations, however many non-

475

synonymous polymorphisms were found within the AGT1 sequences. Indeed, docking

476

simulations indicate reduced maltose and maltrotriose binding capacity in the truncated

477

proteins in comparison to the non-truncated Agt1p copies (Figure S9C, p-value < 0.001

478

Student-test). Nevertheless, we did not find a direct correlation between fermentation

479

performance and a specific truncated Agt1p copy or a significant correlation between

480

fermentation performance and number of copies of the functional Agt1p transporter. These

481

results suggest that other genomic regions might be involved in maltose uptake generating

482

the observed differences in fermentation performance.

486

DISCUSSION

487

Our results, as well as others (see (Libkind et al. 2011; Peris et al. 2014) strongly suggest

488

that S. eubayanus is preferentially found in association with Nothofagus trees, particularly

489

N. pumilio (the most cold-adapted Nothofagus (de Porras et al. 2012; Hinojosa et al. 2016b).

490

Under this scenario, the biogeographic history of S. eubayanus should be strongly correlated

491

with the Nothofagus dispersal history across the globe. Interestingly, the isolation frequency

492

of S. eubayanus was correlated with the latitude. PB-1 is located at higher latitudes (and

493

lower altitudes) and the isolation frequency of this lineage was lower than that of the other

494

two. Overall, PB-2 and PB-3 were easily recovered from the environment and were

495

specifically associated with high altitude N. pumilio trees. These results are in agreement

496

with those reported for S. eubayanus in Argentina (Eizaguirre et al. 2018). The lower

497

frequency of isolates found in samples from Tierra del Fuego could be due to the extreme

498

environmental conditions confronted in this part of the continent, with average temperatures

499

below 5°C throughout most of the year (Ponce and Fernández 2014). However, the

500

extended distribution and higher abundance of N. pumilio in Tierra del Fuego compared to

501

northern areas may facilitate S. eubayanus survival, range distribution, and habitat

502

colonization (Hildebrand-Vogel et al. 1990) increasing population size and genetic diversity.

503

The genus Nothofagus was originated during the late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary interchange

504

(ca. 135 MYA); between Southeast Asia and Australia, from a “fagalean” complex in

505

Southeast Asia (Hill 1992b; Hinojosa et al. 2016b). At the time, Antarctica was in a northern

506

position connecting South America, Tasmania, Australia and New Zealand; and had a warm-

507

humid climate (=”mesothermal conditions”, sensu (Hinojosa et al. 2016b)). Then, a step-

508

wise dispersion-colonization wave following a westward direction reached South America.

509

This scenario is consistent with a dispersal of the S. eubayanus and S. uvarum ancestor

510

across the South Hemisphere (Hill 1992a; Hershkovitz 1999; Dutra and Batten 2000).

511

The phylogenetic analysis presented here of wild S. eubayanus demonstrates that the

512

Patagonia B lineage is actually composed of three clean lineages: PB-1, PB-2 and PB-3.

513

Interestingly, no strains belonging to the Patagonia A lineage were found amongst our

514

samples despite this lineage being highly abundant in Argentinian Patagonia (Eizaguirre et

515

al. 2018; Langdon et al. 2019). From the linkage disequilibrium analysis we found smaller

516

linkage blocks and higher Fis values in the PB-1 cluster, compared to PB-2 and PB-3. This

517

suggests that meiosis and inbreeding are more frequent in PB-1. Additionally, the nucleotide

518

diversity of PB-1 was higher than that of the other populations, and this was supported by

519

greater genetic diversity among individuals sampled from Coyhaique, Torres del Paine,

520

Magallanes and Karukinka locations. Individuals from these sites had high nucleotide

521

diversity which is interesting given that dispersal of N. pumilio is also greater than in northern

522

regions. Nevertheless, southern regions only contained individuals from a single lineage,

523

contrasting northern sites which harbour individuals from more than a population.

524

Interestingly, a subgroup of the PB-1 isolates is found at lower latitudes, which means that

525

PB-1, PB-2 and PB-3 are sympatric. Indeed, our STRUCTURE and pan-genome analyses

526

provide evidence of contact and admixture between PB-1 and the other two. That being

527

said, some of these admixed strains have migrated to other regions around the world,

528

including North America, China and Oceania. Overall, all of the admixed strains from Chile,

529

New Zealand and North America contained regions from the PB-1 lineage, suggesting an

530

‘out-of-Patagonia’ origin for most strains in the Holarctic lineage, and even Oceania, and

531

demonstrating the success of the PB-1 lineage.

532

The genetic diversity reported here for the PB South American clades is higher than that

533

reported for S. eubayanus in the Northern Hemisphere (Peris et al. 2016). Indeed, our results

534

resemble those obtained in the sister species for S. uvarum, where similar sequence

535

divergence among S. uvarum populations were described (Almeida et al. 2014).

536

Interestingly, based on the levels of genetic diversity and heterozigosity, our results support

537

the idea that PB-1 S. eubayanus from Tierra del Fuego is the oldest population in Patagonia,

538

and

539

hybridization/introgression into northern populations (see Fig 2). This scenario is also

540

consistent with the idea that S. eubayanus cryotolerance evolved recently, as N. pumilio (its

541

preferred environment) became secondarily adapted to cold during the orogenesis of the

542

Andes, a relatively young mountain range (de Porras et al. 2012; Hinojosa et al. 2016a;

543

Horton 2018). Also, it is now accepted that the distribution of Nothofagus (and subsequently

544

S. eubayanus) was already established in Patagonia before the onset of the last glacial

545

maximum (ca 20,000 years ago), whose ice sheets covered most land masses south of 41º.

546

Thus, there was massive floristic recolonization and ecological succession after this period

547

(Sersic et al. 2011; de Porras et al. 2012). Our results are consistent with this second

548

scenario (colonization from peripheral glacial refugia from the South) since we found lower

549

genetic diversity in populations located in central Chile (Altos de Lircay & Nahuelbuta) than

550

in populations found in southern Chile (Coyhaique, Torres del Paine, Magallanes and

551

Karukinka). Interestingly, a different pattern would be observed on the other side of the

552

Andes (Argentinian territory), where a lower number of peripheral glacial refugia occurred

553

and most of the diversity would originate from Valleys refugia in northen sites (Sersic et al.

554

2011). Indeed, in Argentina a greater S. eubayanus genetic diversity is reported north of

555

41°, where different lineages congregate in a single geographic location (Langdon et al.

556

2019). Thus, different glaciation refugia would have shaped the current genetic diversity and

557

dispersal of S. eubayanus populations in Patagonia.

561

located in northern populations grew much faster at higher temperatures than individuals

562

from the south, in agreement with the idea of local adaptation. High temperature growth has

563

been extensively studied in S. cerevisiae isolates (Steinmetz et al. 2002; Parts et al. 2011;

564

Yang et al. 2013; Wilkening et al. 2014), where several natural variants were mapped down

565

to the gene level. The fact that fermentation capacity was negatively correlated with latitude

566

represents a striking to the low phenotypic diversity found under microcultivation conditions,

567

suggesting that isolates found in northern regions could represent potential new strains for

568

the brewing industry. Specifically, strains found at lower latitudes showed greater CO2

569

release and maltose consumption, contrasting with fermentation performances obtained in

570

the east side of the Andes where northern isolates belonging to the PA lineage showed

571

lower fermentation performances (Eizaguirre et al. 2018). Selection in maltose transporter

572

could impact sugar assimilation (Brickwedde et al. 2018). In this context, the AGT1 gene

573

encodes for a high-affinity maltose and maltrotriose transporter (Alves et al. 2008) and is

574

responsible for this capacity in S. pastorianus. S. eubayanus strains carry different putative

575

copies of AGT1, however none of these are directly correlated with fermentation

576

performance nor with the transport of maltotriose. Yet, overexpression of a Holarctic allelic

577

variant of seAGT1 was able to confer maltotriose consumption (Baker and Hittinger 2019).

578

As expected, in our study no wild S. eubayanus isolate was found to consume maltotriose;

579

this was not surprising given that S. cerevisiae is the only Saccharomyces species in the

580

genus able to utilize maltrotriose as its carbon source (Krogerus et al. 2015 2018).

581

In sum, our results provide evidence of an ‘Out-of-Patagonia’ dispersal in the S. eubayanus

582

species and that this dispersal is responsible for the current extensive genetic diversity found

583

in the species. The majority of the S. eubayanus strains collected around the world belong

584

to the Patagonian cluster, even a subset of those recently found in China, supporting a

585

successful colonization from Out-of-Patagonia towards the Northern Hemisphere and

586

Oceania. Finally, our data in S. eubayanus together with previous evidence in S. uvarum

587

(Almeida et al. 2014) could possibly suggest that the ancestor of both species originated in

588

the South Hemisphere, rather than China. However, the current available data is insufficient

589

to draw further conclusions regarding the evolutionary history of the two species and future

590

studies and evidences are needed to support these results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

593

Sample areas and yeast isolation

594

Bark samples from ‘lenga’ (Nothofagus pumilio), coigüe (N.dombeyi) and ‘ñirre’ (N.

595

Antarctica) and Araucaria araucana were obtained aseptically from ten sampling sites in

596

Chile (collection date, Figure 1): National Park Altos de Lircay (January 2018, 35°36’34’’S,

597

70°57’58’’W), Nahuelbuta National Park (February 2018, 37°47’33’’S, 72°59’53’’W),

598

Villarrica National Park (January 2017, 39°28’52’’S, 71°45’50’’W), Choshuenco National

599

Park (January 2018, 39°50’2’’S, 72°4’57’’W), Antillanca National Park (November 2017,

600

40°46’23’’S, 72°12’15’’W), Vicente Pérez Rosales National Park (November 2017,

601

41°6’15’’S, 72°29’45’’W), Coyhaique National Reserve (February 2017, 45°31’23’’S,

602

71°59’19’’W), Torres del Paine National Park (February 2018, 50°56’32’’S, 73°24’24’’W),

603

Magallanes National Reserve (January 2018, 53°8’45’’S, 71°0’12’’W) and Karukinka Natural

604

Park (January 2018, 54°6’4’’S, 69°21’24’’W). All sampling sites were located at least five km

605

from human settlements.

606

For each site, at least 25 bark samples of about 1g and 20 x 1 mm were obtained and

607

immediately incubated in a 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of enrichment media. The media

608

contained 2% yeast nitrogen base, 1% raffinose, 2% peptone and 8% ethanol (Sampaio and

609

Goncalves 2008). Overall, 553 samples were collected (Table S1). Samples were incubated

610

for two weeks at 20°C without agitation and were subsequently vortexed and plated (5 L)

611

onto YPD agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose and 2% agar). Isolated colonies

612

were stored in glycerol 20% v/v and stored at -80°C in the Molecular Genetics Laboratory

613

yeast collection at Universidad de Santiago de Chile.

614

Saccharomyces eubayanus identification and FACS analysis

615

We amplified and sequenced the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) to identify colonies

616

to the genus level. For this, ITS1 and ITS4 primers (J White et al. 1990) were used and we

617

classified as Saccharomyces fragment sizes ranging between 830 and 880 bp (Pham et al.

618

2011). Species identification was conducted using the polymorphic marker GSY1 and RIP1

619

through amplification and enzyme restriction (see details in (Peris et al. 2014)). Then,

620

restriction fragment length polymorphism were performed using the restriction enzymes

621

HaeIII and EcoRI as previously described (Peris et al. 2014). Colonies were classified based

622

on restriction patterns as either S. eubayanus, S. uvarum or S. cerevisiae (Peris et al. 2014).

623

In many cases, species identification was confirmed by Sanger-sequencing of the ITS

624

region, which was attained using a BLASTN against the Genbank database under 100%

625

identity as threshold.

626

DNA content was analysed using a propidium iodide (PI) staining assay. Cells were first

627

pulled out from glycerol stocks on YPD solid media and incubated overnight at 30 °C. The

628

following day a small portion of each patch was taken with a pipette tip and transferred in

629

liquid YPD in a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 30 °C. Then, 3 μl were taken and

630

resuspended in 100 μl of cold 70% ethanol. Cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C, washed twice

631

with PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of staining solution (15 μM PI, 100 μg/ml RNase A, 0.1%

632

v/v Triton-X, in PBS) and finally incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the dark. Ten thousand cells for

633

each sample were analysed on a FACS-Calibur flow cytometer using the HTS module for

634

processing 96-well plates. Cells were excited at 488 nM and fluorescence was collected with

635

a FL2-A filter. The data collected were analysed in R with flowCore (Hahne et al. 2009) and

636

flowViz (Sarkar et al. 2008) and plotted with ggplot. The highest density value of FL2-A was

637

associated with the ploidy level of G1 cells, thus cells that are not dividing, and used for

638

inferring the ploidy state of the sample. FL2-A values between 60 and 110 for G1 cells were

639

associated with haploid state, FL2-A values between 120 and 220 were associated with

640

diploid state and FL2-A values between 290 and 400 were associated with a tetraploid state.

641

Sequencing, Reads processing and Mapping

642

DNA was obtained using a Qiagen Genomic-tip 20/G kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The

643

library prep reaction used was a 100x miniaturized version of the Illumina Nextera method.

644

In this prep, 1.6 ng of total DNA mass is tagmented in a 5X diluted Tagmentation reaction.

645

The 0.5 L reaction was quenched by 0.5% SDS(0.125% final concentration) at room

646

temperature for 5 minutes. After quenching, 125 nL of a P5 sequencing barcode and 125 nL

647

of a P7 sequencing barcode were added to the 0.625 nL reaction. In order to amplify the

648

library of inserts, 24.125 L of 1X KAPA Library Amplification Master Mix were added to the

649

reaction. The library went through 15 cycles of PCR to add the barcodes to then amplify the

650

library to a concentration >4 nM. The libraries were then normalized and pooled according

651

to the Illumina standard operating procedure and sequenced on a NextSeq 500/550 High

652

Output Kit v2.5 (300 Cycles) flow cell.

653

Read quality and summary statistics were examined using FastQC 0.11.8 (Andrews 2014).

654

Reads were processed with fastp 0.19.4 (low quality 3’ end trimming, 37 bp minimum read

655

size) (Brickwedde et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2018). We also obtained publicly available

656

sequencing reads of S. eubayanus (Bing et al. 2014; Gayevskiy and Goddard 2016; Peris

657

et al. 2016; Brickwedde et al. 2018) and S. pastorianus (Baker et al, 2015} from the SRA

658

database, which were processed similarly, i.e. visual inspection with FastQC and processing

659

adaptors, low quality 3’ ends, and read size, with fastp. Processed reads were aligned

against the Saccharomyces eubayanus CBS12357T reference genome (Brickwedde et al.

661

2018) using BWA-mem (options: -M -R)(Li 2013). Mapping quality and overall statistics were

662

collected and examined with Qualimap (García-Alcalde et al. 2012). Summary statistics are

663

shown in Table S2. Sorting and indexing of ouput bam files were performed using

664

SAMTOOLS 1.9 (Li et al. 2009). A S. uvarum isolate (CL1105) isolated from Nahuelbuta

665

was also mapped to the S. eubayanus and S. uvarum CBS7001 genome (Scannell et al.

666

2011; Almeida et al. 2014) for phylogenetic analysis.

667

Variant calling

668

Mapping files were tagged for duplicates using MarkDuplicates of Picard tools 2.18.14

669

(http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Variant calling and filtering was done with GATK

670

version 4.0.10.1 (DePristo et al. 2011). More specifically, variants were called per sample

671

and chromosome using HaplotypeCaller (default settings), after which variant databases

672

were build using GenomicsDBImport. Genotypes for each chromosome were called using

673

GenotypeGVCFs (-G StandardAnnotation). Variant files were merged into one genome-

674

wide file using MergeVcfs. This file was divided by SNP calls and INDEL calls using

675

SelectVariants. We applied GATK recommended filters to both variant files, i.e. for SNPs

676

“QD < 2.0 || FS > 60.0 || MQ < 40.0 || MQRankSum < -12.5 || ReadPosRankSum < -8.0”,

677

and for INDELS “QD < 2.0 || FS > 200.0 || ReadPosRankSum < -20.0". We then processed

678

the SNPs VCF file with vcftools (---minQ 30, --max-missing 1 , --max-alleles 2 (Van der

679

Auwera et al. 2013). Furthermore, we applied a stricter criteria to filter heterozygous calls

680

using bcftools view (-e 'GT="0/1" & QUAL<7000 & AC=1') version 1.9 (Li et al. 2009)}. In

681

addition, the effect of each variant was assessed and annotated with SnpEff version 4.3t

682

(Cingolani et al. 2012), using an updated version of S. eubayanus gene annotations

683

(Brickwedde et al. 2018)

685

We obtained a phylogenetic tree using 590,909 biallleic SNPs. VCF files were imported to

686

R (version 3.5.2)(Development Core Team) and converted to genlight objects with vcfR

687

version 1.8.0 (Knaus and Grunwald 2017). A bitwise distance matrix was calculated with the

688

package poppr version 2.8.1 (Kamvar et al. 2014), and a neighbour-joining tree was built

689

using the function aboot, using 1000 bootstraps. Trees were visualized in the iTOL website

690

(http://itol.embl.de). A thinned version of the VCF file was generated with vcftools 0.1.15 (--

691

thin 1000)(Danecek et al. 2011), containing 9,885 similarly-spaced SNPs. Structure was run

692

on this dataset five times for K values ranging from 3 to 7, with 10,000 burn-in and 100,000

693

replications for each run and using admixture model, infer alpha, lambda =1, fpriormean =1,

694

unifprioralpha 1, alpha max 10. The structure-selector website was used to obtain the

695

optimal K values (http://lmme.qdio.ac.cn/StructureSelector/) (Li and Liu 2018) according to

696

the Evanno method (Evanno et al. 2005) and to obtain the final results for each K, which

697

were plotted using CLUMPAK (Kopelman et al.). The resulting diagrams were visualised

698

using structure plot (http://omicsspeaks.com/strplot2/)(Ramasamy et al. 2014). In addition,

699

we performed clustering analyses of the same samples by using Discriminant Analysis of

700

Principal Components (DAPC) of the adegenet R package version 2.1.1 (Jombart 2008) run

701

with PB-1, PB-2 and PB-3 as population priors. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between

702

lineages was calculated using variants belonging to each Patagonia B population. LD decay

703

was estimated by calculating R2 values using with vcftools (----geno-r2 --ld-window-bp

704

100000), which were imported into R to calculate a regression according to (Hill and Weir

705

1988), for which the half decay was estimated (Ldmax/2).

706

Population Genetics

707

We estimated standard population parameters π , Tajima’s D, Fu and Li's D, and Fu's F

708

using the R packages PopGenome 2.6.0 (Pfeifer et al. 2014). Values of Fst were estimated

709

with StAMPP 1.5.1 (Pembleton et al. 2013) to obtain 95% confidence intervals by performing

710

5,000 bootstraps. Populations were designated as PB-1, PB-2, PB-3, or by sampling into

711

each geographical location from the same lineage (for example, only PB-1s were compared

712

between localities).

713

The variants of the mosaic S. eubayanus strains were split to bins of 100 SNPs (on average

714

~5kb windows) and each bin was assigned to either of the populations (i.e. PB-1, PB-2, PB-

715

3, or PA) using adegenet’s hyb.pred function. This algorithm uses DAPC to estimate

716

membership probability of a hybrid dataset to a known cluster (populations). The Argentinian

717

strains yHCT104 and yHCT72 were used as PA representative members.

718

The R package hierfstat (Goudet 2005) was used to calculate Fis, Hs, and Ho by using the

719

basic.stats function. Bootstrapping per loci on each population’s Fis was done using

720

hierfstat’s boot.ppfis, obtaining the 50th and 97.5th quantiles after 50000 boostraps. To

721

perform a Mantel test, first the Nei’s genetic distances between subpopulations (considering

722

localities) was calculated with the R package StAMPP (Pembleton et al. 2013). Euclidean

723

distance between localities was calculated using latitude and distances coordinates with R

724

‘dist’ function. Randel test was performed using the ade4 R package (Dray and Dufour

725

2007).

Pangenome

Isolates were assembled with assembled with Spades using k from 21 to 67. To detect the

728

non-reference material we used the custom pipeline based on the method described in

729

(Peter et al. 2018). LRSDAY software (Yue and Liti) was used to annotate the non-reference

730

material. The newly annotated ORFs have been added to the reference ORFs and a custom

731

pipeline, also based on methods from (Peter et al.) was used to collapse ORFs with identity

percentage over 95, selecting an unique reference for each groups of allelic variants to

obtain a list of non-redundant pangenomic ORF sequences. Confirmation of presence of

734

these ORFs has been obtained by mapping the reads of each strain to the set of pangenomic

735

ORFs using BWA mem with the option – U 0. Filtering was performed with samtools with

736

options –bSq 20 –F260.

737

Strains Phenotyping and Fermentations

738

The microcultivation phenotyping assay of the S. eubayanus strains was performed as

739

previously described (Kessi-Perez et al. 2016). Briefly, isolates were pre-cultivated in 200

740

L of YNB medium supplemented with glucose 2% for 48h at 25°C. For the experimental

741

assay, strains were inoculated to an optical density (OD) of 0.03–0.1 (wavelenght 630 nm)

742

in 200 uL of media and incubated without agitation at 25°C for 24 h (YNB control) and 48 h

743

for other conditions in a Tecan Sunrise absorbance microplate reader. OD was measured

744

every 20 minutes using a 630 nm filter. Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate.

745

Maximum growth rate, lag time and OD max for each strain were calculated using

746

GrowthRates software with default parameters (Hall et al. 2014).

747

Fermentation in beer wort and HPLC analysis

748

Fermentations were conducted using a 12°P high-gravity wort at 12°C in 50 mL (micro-

749

fermentations). The 12 °P wort was prepared from a Munton's Connoisseurs Pilsner Lager

750

kit (Muntons plc, England). The worts were oxygenated to 15 mg/L prior to pitching. For the

751

micro-fermentations, the strains were initially grown with constant agitation in 5 mL of wort

752

for 48 hours at 15°C. Following this, 50 mL of fresh wort were inoculated to a final

753

concentration of 15 × 106 viable cells/mL and fermentations were maintained for seven days.

754

Fermentations were weighed every day to calculate the CO2 output. The fermentations were

755

maintained until no-CO2 lost was observed. At the end of the fermentation, the fermented

756

worts were centrifuged at 9,000xg for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. From this,

757

the concentration of extracellular metabolites was determined using HPLC. Specifically, 20

758

L of filtered wort were injected in a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC (Shimadzu, USA) with a

759

Bio-Rad HPX –87H column (Nissen et al., 1997). In this way, the concentrations of glucose,

760

fructose, maltose, maltotriose, ethanol, and glycerol were estimated.

761

Data Analysis

762

Multiple comparisons across localities were performed utilising a non-parametric Kruskal-

763

Wallis test and Dunn's Multiple Test Comparison. Genomewide Fis and Fst data across

764

lineages was compared using paired Student t-test. Spearman rank correlation test and

765

Pearson test were performed to determine correlations between variables. Finally, all

766

analyses were performed utilising GraphPad Prism Software 5.2, except for correlation

767

analysis which were performed in R (Development Core Team). In all cases p-values < 0.05

768

were considered as significant.

truncated proteins consist of the first 50, 180 and 290 aminacids approximately for AGT1_V,

1076

AGT1_XIII and AGT1_XVI respectively. The truncated proteins are translated from the N-
