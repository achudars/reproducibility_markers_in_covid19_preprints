Abstract
1. Testosterone is a key regulator of vertebrate social behavior. As such, testosterone can

18

mediate and respond to social interaction dynamics.
2. Although experiments have demonstrated that testosterone signaling pathways can

20

influence aggression and cooperation, no study has examined the links between hormone
levels, behavioral phenotypes, and emergent properties of the social network. In other

22

words, how do mechanisms underlying an individual’s social behavior scale-up to
influence the emergent properties of the social network?

24

3. Here, we address this question by studying wire-tailed manakins, a species of bird in
which males cooperate to court females at sites known as leks. Our previous experiments

26

established that testosterone can influence the social behavior of individual male
manakins. In the present study, we use an automated proximity system to monitor

28

multiple manakin leks and measure the social network at each lek repeatedly through
time. We also quantified the testosterone phenotype of all individuals in the lek.

30

4. Our analysis examines how the collective hormone phenotype of individuals within the
lek affects three emergent properties of the social network: social specialization (the

32

exclusivity of social relationships), network stability (the persistence of partnerships
through time), and behavioral assortment (like associating with like). These three

34

properties are expected to enhance the benefits of cooperation. We found that the
manakin social networks with high-testosterone, dominant individuals were less

36

specialized, less stable, and had more negative behavioral assortment.

Introduction
44

Testosterone signalling pathways can both mediate and respond to dynamic social environments
in a diversity of vertebrates (Wingfield et al. 1990; Oyegbile & Marler 2005; Adkins-Regan

46

2005; Goymann 2009; Fuxjager et al. 2010; Eisenegger et al. 2011). For example, hormonesignaling pathways at the level of the individual are essential for the development and expression

48

of complex behavioral phenotypes (Cohen et al. 2012), which are hypothesized to shape social
interaction dynamics and higher order social network structure. Testing this hypothesis is

50

challenging, because it requires linking fine-scale measures of behavior and physiology with
broad-scale measurements that characterize the collective behavior of the group (Krause &

52

Ruxton 2002).
Here, we leverage a large and comprehensive dataset on the circulating hormone levels,

54

behavioral phenotypes, and social networks of a cooperative bird, the wire-tailed manakin (Pipra
filicauda), to test the hypothesis that testosterone-mediated behavior drives emergent social

56

structure. Male wire-tailed manakins form cooperative display coalitions on sites known as leks
to attract females (Heindl 2002). These coalition partnerships are essential for male fitness

58

(Ryder et al. 2008, 2009) and form the basis of complex and dynamic social networks (Ryder et
al. 2008, 2011a; Dakin & Ryder 2018). The social networks of wire-tailed manakins can also

60

exhibit temporal variation in structure (Dakin & Ryder preprint in review). This is important
because the emergent properties of the social network are theoretically predicted to influence the

62

costs and benefits of cooperation, and hence shape selection on individual behavior. For
example, cooperation in social networks is favored when individuals interact with a limited set of

64

familiar partners, when these relationships are temporally stable, and when helping is

reciprocated by immediate neighbors in the group (Trivers 1971; Roberts & Sherratt 1998;
66

Ohtsuki et al. 2006).
Can hormone-phenotypes at the individual level scale-up to influence these processes?

68

We have previously shown that male manakins differ in their circulating testosterone levels, with
some individuals have consistently higher testosterone than others (Fig. 1A). Moreover, variation

70

in testosterone level can also explain repeatable, among-individual differences in the frequency
and number of social partnerships (Ryder et al. in press). As observed in other vertebrates

72

(Eisenegger et al. 2011; Boksem et al. 2013), these hormone-behavior relationships are statusspecific in wire-tailed manakins. Among dominant, territory-holding males, high testosterone

74

levels are associated with reduced cooperative behavior (Ryder et al. in press). However, in the
subordinate, “floater” males, high testosterone is associated with increased cooperative behavior

76

and subsequent territory acquisition (Ryder et al. in press), both of which are essential for
reproductive fitness (Ryder et al. 2008, 2011b).

78

In this study, we used an automated proximity data-logging system to record over 36,000
unique male-male social interactions. These data allowed us to analyze repeated measures of the

80

weighted social networks at 11 different leks where manakin coalitions occur. A recent study
showed that the collective hormonal profile of human social groups can predict group success at

82

social tasks (Akinola et al. 2016). Hence, we similarly defined “collective testosterone” for
manakin groups as the weighted average testosterone phenotype of the individuals comprising

84

each lek social network, whereby each male’s contribution was weighted by his social activity
(i.e., frequency of cooperative interactions or “strength”). Because hormone-behavior

86

relationships are status-specific (Ryder et al. in press), collective testosterone was calculated for
each of the two status classes separately. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, this measure ranks social

88

networks on a scale ranging from those made up of mostly low-testosterone individuals, to those
made up of mostly high-testosterone individuals.

90

We evaluated whether collective testosterone was associated with three emergent
properties of social networks. The first property, social specialization, is a measure of the

92

exclusivity of the relationships between coalition partners. To quantify specialization at the
network level, we used the H2’ metric from community ecology, which provides a standardized

94

ranking of bipartite networks on a scale from highly generalized to highly specialized (Blüthgen
et al. 2006). In the context of manakin behavior, highly specialized networks exhibit a high

96

frequency of exclusive partnerships between males of different status classes, as illustrated in
Fig. S1. In other species, social specialization has been found to maximize the quality and

98

coordination of different types of behaviors (Jehn & Shah 1997; Laskowski et al. 2016); in
manakins, we expect specialization to improve the signal quality of male-male courtship

100

displays. Greater specialization is also expected to minimize conflict over mating and territorial
ascension opportunities (Schjelderup-Ebbe 1922; McDonald 1993).

102

The second property, network stability, quantifies the average persistence of social
partnerships through time (Dakin & Ryder preprint in review; Poisot et al. 2012). Coalition

104

partnerships require the coordination of complex behaviors, and previous empirical work
indicates that longer partnership tenure has a positive effect on display coordination (Trainer &

106

McDonald 1995; Trainer et al. 2002). Greater temporal stability of partnerships also increases
the opportunity for sustained reciprocity within the network (Trivers 1971; Roberts & Sherratt

108

1998; Croft et al. 2006). The third property, behavioral assortment, captures the extent to which
males interact with partners who express similar behaviors (i.e., is like associated with like?

110

(Croft et al. 2006; Farine 2014)). At the proximate level, positive assortment may represent the

outcome of generalized reciprocity (Fowler & Christakis 2010; Dakin & Ryder 2018). At the
112

ultimate level, positive assortment has also been shown to promote the evolution of cooperation
(Ohtsuki et al. 2006). To quantify the overall behavioral assortment of the manakin networks, we

114

used a composite measure that averaged the assortativity of “strength” (a male’s frequency of
cooperative interactions) with that of “degree” (his number of cooperative partnerships) (Dakin

116

& Ryder 2018). Examples of networks illustrating behavioral assortment are also shown in Fig.
S1.

Materials and Methods
120

Study Population
We studied wire-tailed manakins (Pipra filicauda) at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in

122

Orellana Province, Ecuador (0º 38’ S, 76º 08’ W). This population of P. filicauda has been
studied and individuals color-banded annually since 2002 (Ryder et al. 2008, 2009). Wire-tailed

124

manakins are a long-lived species in which the males form cooperative display coalitions to court
females on sites known as leks (Heindl 2002). There are two male status classes in P. filicauda:

126

subordinate non-territorial floater males, and dominant territorial males. Previous research has
established that territory ownership is a prerequisite for mating, and that both floaters and

128

territory-holders benefit from cooperative partnerships (Ryder et al. 2008, 2009). Specifically,
floaters with more social partners are more likely to inherit a territory, and territory-holders with

130

more partners achieve greater reproductive success (Ryder et al. 2008, 2009). The present study
was conducted on 11 leks where the males perform their cooperative courtship displays during

132

peak breeding activity (December-March) across three field seasons: 2015-16, 2016-17 and
2017-18 (Ryder et al. in press). All research was approved by the Smithsonian ACUC (protocols

136

Testosterone Assay
138

Male manakins were caught at leks using mist-nets up to three times per field season. Following
capture and removal from the mist net, a small blood sample (< 125uL) was taken from the

140

brachial vein and stored on ice prior to being centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, as described in
(Ryder et al. 2011b; Vernasco et al. 2019; Ryder et al. in press). Plasma volume was measured

142

to the nearest 0.25 ul and stored in 0.75 ml of 100% ethanol (Goymann et al. 2007). Plasma
testosterone was double extracted using dichloromethane. Following extraction, direct

144

radioimmunoassay was used to measure the total plasma androgen concentration (ng/ml)
adjusted by the extraction efficiency and plasma volume of each sample (Eikenaar et al. 2011;

146

Ryder et al. 2011b). Hormone assays were conducted annually, and the detection limits were
0.12, 0.08, and 0.09 ng/ml for 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18, respectively; any sample that fell

148

below the assay-specific limit of detection was assigned that limit as its testosterone
concentration as a most conservative estimate. As reported in our previous study (Ryder et al. in

150

press), the extraction efficiency for all samples was between 62-73%, and the intra-assay
coefficients of variation were 6.6%, 11.6%, and 9.2% for 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18,

152

respectively; the inter-assay coefficient of variation was 19.5%.

154

Behavioral Assay
To quantify social behaviors, we used an automated proximity data-logging system to monitor

156

the activity on the territories of 11 leks (Ryder et al. 2012; Dakin & Ryder 2018; Ryder et al. in

press). At the beginning of each field season, males were outfitted with a coded nano-tag
158

(NTQB-2, Lotek Wireless; 0.35 g). The tags transmitted a unique VHF signal ping once per 20 s
for three months. In total, 296 tag deployments were performed on 180 individual males, 178 of

160

whom also had hormone data (mean 3 hormone samples per male ± SD 1.5). Approximately 10
days (± SD 7) after tagging and sampling was completed at a given lek, a proximity data-logger

162

(SRX-DL800, Lotek Wireless) was deployed within each territory to record tagged males within
a detection radius of 30 m (a distance that corresponds to the average diameter of a manakin

164

display territory (Heindl 2002; Dakin & Ryder 2018)). Proximity recording sessions ran from
06:00 to 16:00 for ~6 consecutive days (± SD 1 day) and were performed ~3 times per season at

166

each lek. Prior to data-logger deployment, each territory was also observed on non-recording
days to identify the territory-holder based on his color-bands, following the protocol in previous

168

studies (Ryder et al. 2008, 2009). These status assignments were subsequently verified in the
proximity data. In total, we conducted 86 recording sessions (29,760 data-logger hours)

170

representing repeated measures of the social activity at 11 different leks.
To quantify social interactions in the proximity data, the tag detections were filtered

172

using an spatiotemporal algorithm to identify unique joint detections, when two males were
located within a display territory (Ryder et al. 2008, 2012; Dakin & Ryder 2018). A detailed

174

description of the algorithm is provided in (Dakin & Ryder 2018). A ground-truthing experiment
in that study also confirmed that these joint detections represent occasions when two males were

176

< 5 m apart (Dakin & Ryder 2018), corresponding to the range required for a typical male-male
social display (Heindl 2002). An additional validation study also confirmed that the social

178

interactions defined by this method corresponded to display coalitions that were directly

observed (Ryder et al. 2012). In total, we identified 36,885 unique social interactions over the
180

three field seasons in this study.

182

Quantification and Statistical Analysis
All quantitative analyses were performed in R (R Core Team 2018).

184

Network Analysis
186

We used the igraph package (Csardi & coathors 2018) to construct a weighted social network for
each lek recording session. The individual males who interacted on the lek were defined as the

188

nodes, and the links (or edges) between them were weighted by the social interaction
frequencies. We quantified three emergent network properties for each lek recording session:

190

social specialization, network stability, and behavioral assortment, as described below.
For specialization, we sought a measure that would capture the extent to which a network

192

was partitioned into exclusive social relationships (as opposed to a network made up of nonspecific or non-exclusive partnerships). To do this, we used a network metric of specialization

194

that is commonly used in community ecology to analyze ecological networks, called H2’
(Blüthgen et al. 2006). An advantage of H2’ is that it is standardized against a theoretical

196

maximum, based on the overall activity levels of different nodes and Shannon entropy (Blüthgen
et al. 2006); this makes it possible to compare the extent of specialization across different

198

bipartite networks in a standardized way. To apply this metric to our manakin data, we converted
each lek social network into its bipartite adjacency matrix, with floaters along one axis, and

200

territory-holders on the other, and then calculated social specialization as H2’ using the bipartite
package (Dormann et al. 2019). Higher values of this metric indicate that the network is made up

11
202

of more exclusive relationships, as illustrated in Fig. S1. We chose to focus on floater-territorial
specialization because these are by far the most common partnerships in this social system with

204

reproductive benefits to both parties (Ryder et al. 2011a).
To quantify the stability of social relationships, we compared each lek social network

206

derived from one recording session to that derived from the subsequent recording session within
the same field season (if available). Network stability was then calculated as the number of male-

208

male partnerships (network edges) shared by both time points divided by the number of
partnerships at either time point (i.e., the intersection divided by the union (Dakin & Ryder

210

preprint in review)). Higher values of stability indicate greater persistence of social relationships
within the network, independent of any changes in the representation of particular males (nodes)

212

(Poisot et al. 2012). To reduce the influence of partnerships that occurred only rarely (Farine et
al. 2017), prior to the stability calculation we filtered the data to include only significant edges

214

that occurred more often than expected in 1,000 random permutations of the interaction data, and
at least six times during a recording session (i.e., on average, once per day). Our previous work

216

has established that network stability is robust to alternative thresholds for occurrence and that
the wire-tailed manakin networks are more stable than expected by chance (Dakin & Ryder

218

preprint in review).
Assortment refers to the extent to which individuals associate with similar partners; it can

220

be due to partner choice (homophily), shared environments, or the social transmission of
behavior (Dakin & Ryder 2018). Assortment was quantified using Newman’s assortativity,

222

which is a correlation coefficient for the statistical association among linked nodes within a
network. It ranges from –1 (a negative association), through 0 (no association), and up to +1 (a

224

positive association). To quantify the assortment of cooperative behaviors, we first determined

12
the daily frequency of two behaviors for each male: his number of social interactions (strength),
226

and his number of unique social partnerships (degree) per day (Dakin & Ryder 2018). Strength
and degree are both repeatable measures of a male’s cooperative behavior in our study

228

population (Dakin & Ryder 2018). Next, we computed the average log-transformed strength and
degree within the recording session for each individual, and then calculated a weighted

230

assortativity coefficient for the entire social network using the assortnet package (Farine 2016).
Because assortativity values for strength and degree were highly correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.78, p

232

< 0.0001, n = 86), we took the average of these two values as the measure of overall behavioral
assortment within the social network. Finally, we also computed the assortativity of the two

234

discrete status classes, to ensure that our analysis of behavioral assortment was not solely driven
by status-specific patterns of assortment.

236

Statistical Models
238

Following our previous study (Ryder et al. in press), we characterized each male’s average
circulating testosterone after statistically accounting for capture conditions (“mean T” in (Ryder

240

et al. in press)), including the time of day and duration of time the bird was in the mist-net
(Vernasco et al. 2019). This measure of among-individual testosterone variation was a

242

significant predictor of cooperative behavior in our study system, albeit with different
relationships within each status class (Ryder et al. in press). To quantify collective testosterone,

244

we took the average “mean T” within the social network, weighted by each male’s interaction
frequency (strength) as a measure of his contribution to the network. We calculated collective

246

testosterone separately for each status class because the effects of hormones on social behavior

13
are status-dependent in this and other species (Eisenegger et al. 2011; Boksem et al. 2013; Ryder
248

et al. in press).
To evaluate whether collective testosterone could explain emergent social network

250

properties, we fit mixed-effects models using the packages lme4 and lmerTest (Bates et al. 2018;
Kuznetsova et al. 2018). Each model was fit with a random effect of lek to account for repeated

252

measures (n = 86 measures of 11 leks, except for stability which had n = 60 because stability
requires a subsequent recording session). We used Akaike’s Information Criterion to compare

254

goodness-of-fit for four candidate models, as follows: (1) collective testosterone of territoryholders + collective testosterone of floaters; (2) collective testosterone of territory-holders; (3)

256

collective testosterone of floaters, and (4) no testosterone predictors. All of the candidate models
also included additional fixed effects to account for field season (a categorical variable with three

258

levels), the average Julian date of the recording session, the number of recorded hours per
territory, and the size of the social network (number of individuals). Continuous predictors were

260

standardized (mean = 1, SD = 1) prior to being entered into the analysis so that the slope
estimates would be comparable with other models. Model selection was performed on models fit

262

with maximum likelihood, and then the best-fit models were refit using restricted estimation of
maximum likelihood (REML) to determine p-values (Zuur et al. 2009). We used the lmerTest

264

package to compute p-values for generalized mixed-effects models based on Satterthwaite's
method (Kuznetsova et al. 2018).

266

In two field seasons (2016-17 and 2017-18), nine of the territory-holders were part of an
experiment testing the influence of transiently-elevated testosterone on individual behavior (n =

268

5 individuals in 2016-17 and n = 4 in 2017-18 (Ryder et al. in press)). The results of that
experiment demonstrated that elevated testosterone caused a temporary decrease in the frequency

270

and the number of cooperative partnerships in the altered males, relative to control males (Ryder
et al. in press). However, it is important to note that this experiment was not designed to test

272

effects at the collective level, because it was conducted on a limited scale whereby only one or
two individuals were temporarily altered in only four leks. Therefore, our main analysis here

274

excluded data from recording sessions at manipulated leks. However, we verified that when we
repeated our analyses including these manipulated leks, the main conclusions were unchanged.

276

Furthermore, we did not detect any statistically significant effect of the individual hormone
manipulation on the three network-level properties (i.e., specialization, stability, and assortment;

278

all p > 0.16). Finally and most importantly, controlling for the manipulation also did not affect
any of our conclusions about collective testosterone shown in Fig. 2

280

Randomization Test
282

We performed a randomization test using a null model (Farine et al. 2017) to assess the effect of
randomizing each social network, leaving the testosterone data unchanged. To generate the null

284

data, we randomly permuted the node labels (ID labels) within each of the 86 social networks,
retaining all other features of the social network. After generating each null dataset, we

286

recalculated the network-level properties (specialization, stability, and assortment), and then refit
the top models from our original analysis. We then compared the slope estimates from the

288

observed data to the values obtained from 1,000 of these null permutations.

290

Perturbation Analysis
We performed a social perturbation analysis to determine the sensitivity of our results to the

proceeded by selectively removing males from the social networks in the observed data, to test
294

how much perturbation was necessary to disrupt our main results. We set the number of
individuals removed as a constant proportion of the total number of individuals in the network so

296

that the effect size would be standardized across heterogeneous networks. To do this, we
performed six iterations removing an increasing number of either floater or territory-holding

298

males with each iteration (node removal iterations = 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% of the
individuals in the relevant status class). The number of individuals removed from each network

300

was rounded, such that it was at least one, but not all of the individuals from that status class. To
evaluate the effect of gradually increasing the amount of social perturbation, the simulation

302

proceeded by removing less social (i.e., low-strength) individuals first. After severing all social
ties of the removed individuals, we recalculated the network properties, and refit the top models

304

from our original analysis (Table S1). Then, we compared the beta coefficients for collective
testosterone (standardized slope estimates) to those derived from the original data. A result was

306

considered robust to perturbation if two criteria were met: the slope in the removal analysis was
significantly different from 0, and it was within the 95% confidence interval of the slope from

308

the original data.

310

Results
We found that the collective testosterone of territorial males could predict all three properties of

312

the social networks. Specifically, the leks with a greater number of high-testosterone territorial
males were less specialized, less stable, and more negatively assorted (Fig. 2; all p < 0.03). The

314

coefficients of these relationships were also greater than expected under a null permutation of the
data within each social network (inset panels, Fig. 2; all p < 0.015).

16
We found that removing as few as 10% of the males in either social class (dominant

316

territory-holders or subordinate floaters) eliminated the relationship between stability and
318

collective testosterone. This indicates that stability is highly sensitive to the presence of both
status classes of males within the network. In contrast, behavioral assortment was more robust to

320

the removal of individuals: we had to drop 40% of the territory-holders, or 60% of the floaters, to
disrupt its association with testosterone. Finally, the sensitivity of social specialization was also

322

status-dependent: we found that removing only a few floaters (10%) decoupled the relationship
between specialization and testosterone, whereas 40% of the territorial individuals had to be

324

removed to eliminate this result.

326

Discussion
We found that the collective testosterone of dominant, territory-holding males predicted multiple

328

features of the social network structure. In contrast, the collective testosterone of the floater
males did not predict social network properties. Therefore, although testosterone may determine

330

the behavior of both floater and dominant males (Ryder et al. in press), its effects on dominant
males may represent an extended phenotype that ultimately determines social structure (Dawkins

332

1982).
How can the relationship between hormone levels and network properties be explained in

334

terms of individual behaviors? Given that testosterone has antagonistic effects on the cooperative
behavior of territorial males (Ryder et al. in press), we hypothesize that the behavior of high-

336

testosterone individuals causes multiple properties of stable cooperative networks to rapidly
break down. Based on our results in previous studies (Dakin & Ryder preprint in review; Ryder

338

et al. in press), the high-testosterone dominant individuals have a reduced ability to attract and

17
maintain stable coalition partners (Ryder et al. in press). This weakening of coalition bonds may
340

cause floater males to prospect elsewhere for new partnerships, negatively impacting both the
overall specialization and stability of the social network (Dakin & Ryder preprint in review).

342

Likewise, we propose that behavioral assortment becomes more negative in social networks with
many high-testosterone individuals, because these individuals may inhibit the processes of social

344

contagion, reciprocity, and/or behavioral coordination that contribute to positive assortment
(Dakin & Ryder 2018).

346

Our perturbation analysis suggests that the behavior of the floater males (i.e., initiating
partnerships) may play a key role in determining social specialization within the network.

348

Although this analysis is not a substitute for experimental tests in vivo (Zyphur et al. 2009;
Akinola et al. 2016), it can provide a good indication of the importance of particular individuals

350

to emergent properties of the network. Conducting experimental tests of causation at the level of
whole social networks remains a major challenge (Pinter-Wollman et al. 2014; James et al.

352

2009). With the present data, we cannot rule out the possibility that high-testosterone individuals
chose to participate in certain networks due to other factors that may also influence emergent

354

network properties (e.g., environmental quality and/or female activity). Nevertheless, our data
show that the increased prevalence of dominant individuals with high-testosterone is associated

356

with behavioral dynamics and changes to higher-order social structure that can ultimately
destabilize cooperation. These findings establish that hormone-behavior relationships are not

358

limited to one individual, but instead they may act as extended phenotypes that have populationlevel consequences (McClintock 1981; Dawkins 1982; Robinson 1992). Specifically, we suggest

360

that testosterone is a physiological driver of social network dynamics that may impede the
evolution of cooperation.

Figure 1. Testosterone varies at the level of the social network. (A) Circulating testosterone
varies within- and among-individuals. This graph shows repeated measures from 210 individual

366

male manakins, sorted along the x-axis by their average testosterone level (standardized “mean
T”; modified from Ryder et al. (Ryder et al. in press)). Opacity is used to denote the two male

368

status classes (with subordinate floaters colored semi-transparent, and dominant territory-holders
colored opaque) and color ramping is used to denote each individual’s hormone phenotype. (B-

370

D) Three examples of the social network structure and hormone phenotypes at manakin display
leks. Each node (circle) represents an individual male who engaged in social interactions at the

372

lek. Node size is scaled to his interaction frequency (“strength”); this parameter is also used to
weight each male’s contribution to collective testosterone. Edge thicknesses are also scaled to the

374

log-transformed interaction frequencies for each observed coalition. Node colors indicate an
individual’s hormone phenotype following the scale in (A). The collective testosterone of the

376

social network is calculated as the average of the individual hormone phenotypes within the
social network, weighted by strength as a measure of each male’s contribution. Because

378

hormone-mediated cooperation is status-specific (Ryder et al. in press; Eisenegger et al. 2011),
collective testosterone was determined for each status class separately (indicated by the semi-

380

transparent and opaque color scales for floaters and territory-holders, respectively). See Figure
S1 for additional data.

individuals were less specialized (i.e., partnerships were less exclusive), less stable over time,
386

and had more negative behavioral assortment (i.e., individuals tended to associate with more
dissimilar partners). Each plot shows the partial residuals from a statistical analysis that also

388

accounts for field season, the average Julian date of the recording session, the number of
recorded hours per territory, and network size (fixed effects), as well as a random effect of lek

390

identity. Because the two status classes differ in behavior (Dakin & Ryder 2018), the analysis of
behavioral assortment also accounted for assortment of the status classes within each network as

392

an additional covariate. Different symbols are used to indicate repeated measures of 11 different
leks networks, colored according the collective testosterone gradient in Figure 1B. Inset panels

394

show the results of a null randomization test. In each case, the slope in the best-fit model (solid
vertical line) was significantly more negative than expected in the null permutations of the social

396

networks (grey distribution; dotted vertical line indicates 0; all p-values < 0.015). See Tables S1
and S2 for additional data.
