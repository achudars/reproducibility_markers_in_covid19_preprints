Abstract

31

Objective –

32

Neighborhood characteristics can have profound effects on resident health. The aim of

33

this study was to use an unsupervised learning approach to reduce the multi-dimensional

34

assessment of a neighborhood using American Community Survey (ACS) data to

35

simplify the assessment of neighborhood influence on health.

36

Method –

37

Multivariate quantitative characterization of the neighborhood was derived by performing

38

a factor analysis on the 2011-2015 ACS data. The utility of the latent variables was

39

examined by determining the association of these factors with poor mental health

40

measures from the 500 Cities Project 2017 release.

41

Results –

42

A five-factor model provided the best fit for the data and the latent factors quantified the

43

following characteristics of the census tract: (1) affluence, (2) proportion of singletons in

44

neighborhood, (3) proportion of African-Americans in neighborhood, (4) proportion of

45

seniors in neighborhood, and (5) proportion of noncitizens in neighborhood. African-

46

Americans (R2 = 0.67) in neighborhood and Affluence (R2 = 0.83) were strongly

47

associated with poor mental health.

48

Conclusions –

49

These findings indicate the importance of this factor model in future research focused on

50

the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and resident health.

Introduction

53

There is strong evidence that certain characteristics of the neighborhood are associated

54

with both the physical and the mental health of its residents [1-7]. However, the strength

55

of this effect and the qualities of the neighborhood environment that are related to the

56

effect are unclear. Contradictory results in past studies relating neighborhood

57

characteristics and health indicate that the environmental effect remains elusive [8]. Thus,

58

objectively delineating the dimensions of a neighborhood and evaluating their

59

relationship to mental health could have important implications for future research

60

linking social factors to the biological processes underlying psychiatric disorders.

61
62

Past research has not yet fully elucidated the relationship between mental health and

63

neighborhood environment for several reasons. First, most studies only evaluate the

64

effects of one neighborhood characteristic—commonly neighborhood socioeconomic

65

status (NSES) or racial composition—rather than looking at a broader range of variables

66

describing the neighborhood. There is an emerging consensus that NSES is correlated

67

with physical and mental health, however the lack of more information about the nature

68

of this relationship leaves no hint of how NSES might be linked to these health effects.

69

Second, amidst the current literature are many different approaches in ascertaining a

70

population, extracting neighborhood measures, focusing on specific indices, or selecting

71

a subset of the population. A comprehensive approach has been lacking and could

72

provide a crucial step forward to identify specific environmental factors influencing rates

73

of poor mental health.

75

The American Community Survey (ACS) a household survey conducted by the U.S.

76

Census. It covers a vast number of statistics and includes a substantial sample of the U.S.

77

population. Therefore, it is an ideal dataset for studying demographics. In order to use as

78

many of the statistics provided by the ACS as possible, we used a latent variable

79

approach to arrive at a multivariate quantitative characterization of the neighborhood.

80

This method gave us the opportunity to objectively select variables to include in our

81

analysis based on their contribution to the variance between neighborhoods. We assumed

82

that these statistics are linked by underlying, latent variables. This allowed us to work

83

with a smaller number of variables without sacrificing any data.

84
85

Few studies have used such a method for the characterization of neighborhoods. Miles et

86

al. describes a method for measuring NSES using factor analysis and the ACS that can be

87

explored longitudinally [9]. Their method aims to find significant neighborhood

88

characteristics based on factor invariance. Another study by Li et al. combines factor

89

analysis and cluster analysis for a multivariate-structural approach to characterizing

90

neighborhoods [10]. These studies were used as a template for the method described in

91

this paper. This study aimed to use a latent variable approach to identify factors that

92

comprehensively quantify the neighborhood characteristics. We used the 2011-2015 ACS

93

data and applied a factor analysis method after appropriately transforming selected

94

variables. Moreover, we examined the influence of these latent variables on mental health

95

by comparing the factors to data from the 500 Cities project 2017 release [11]. The 500-

96

cities dataset includes 27,199 tracts. We performed this analysis in order to explore if one

97

or more factors would be significantly associated with proportion of individuals in a

99

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Methods

102

Sample

103

Neighborhood data were obtained from the ACS. The ACS is a national survey that uses

104

continuous measurement methods based on a series of monthly samples to produce

105

annual estimates for the same small areas (census tracts and block groups). The ACS was

106

inaugurated in 2005. Each year, ~3.54 million addresses are surveyed across the country.

107

This sample is sufficient to provide reliable 1-year estimates for geographical areas with

108

a population greater than 65,000; for areas with smaller populations, the sample needs be

109

accumulated over several years to achieve reliable estimates (3-year and 5-year estimates

110

for areas with population larger than and no more than 20,000, respectively) [12]. In this

111

study, neighborhood data were obtained at tract-level from the 5-year estimate spanning

112

2011-2015 [13].

113
114

This study aimed to use data at the smallest geographic division possible for a fine-

115

grained view of living environment. The two smallest geographic divisions available in

116

the ACS dataset are block-groups and tracts. On average, a block group is 1/3 the size of

117

a tract. The factor analysis was performed on both levels and the resulting factors were

118

largely the same (Comparison to Block Group, Supplementary Methods). Though larger,

119

the tract level factors were chosen because there were variables of interest that were not

120

available at the block group level (Fig S1). These variables included disability status,

121

citizenship status, and mobility. Additionally, the tract-level factors have a smaller

122

margin of error.

123
124

There are 72,424 census tracts in the United States that are within city and state

125

boundaries. Tracts consist of areas with a population between 1,200 and 8,000

126

individuals, are primarily defined by population density, and are delineated by visibly

127

identifiable features, such as highways, roads, or rivers. Both home addresses and group

128

quarters were sampled from the tracts. Group quarters are places where a group of people

129

live together in a place which is owned or managed by an entity that provides housing or

130

services to residents; for example, nursing homes, college dormitories, and homeless

131

shelters are all group quarters. Approximately 2.5% of the expected population inhabiting

132

group quarters was sampled [12].

133
134

Data extraction and variable selection

135

ACS variables are organized into tables, which are organized by content and format [14].

136

Not all tables were used in this analysis. A description of the excluded tables and the

137

reason for exclusion is provided in the supplementary material (Table S1). 37 tables were

138

included in the analyses and contained 461 measures describing tract characteristics of

139

age, race/ethnicity, citizenship, nativity, mobility, means of transportation to work,

140

household type, marriage status, education level, disability status, income, employment

141

status, home type, housing cost, and residential tenure. Among these 461 measures, 215

142

were removed due to redundancy or low variability. Redundancy was defined as

143

variables that were sufficiently represented by another variable (for example, the female

144

population is redundant because it is the inverse of the male population). Low variablility

145

was defined as a low coefficient of variation across tracts. A flow chart explaining how

146

the dataset was reduced is given in Fig S2. The remaining 246 statistics describing strata

147

or subgroups (e.g. age groups, gender, education levels) of a tract were combined to form

148

single statistics (Feature Selection, Supplementary Methods). This selection process led

149

to a final number of 39 measures for subsequent analyses.

150
151

These measures were subjected to a heuristic, data-driven transformation approach to

152

approximate Gaussian distributions as close as possible (Transformation, Supplementary

153

Methods). Missing values were imputed by the weighted average of 10-nearest neighbors

154

after transformation.

155
156

Factor analysis

157

A total of 39 transformed and/or imputed measures were then entered into an exploratory

158

factor analysis to investigate the underlying latent variable structure. Factor loadings

159

were estimated by the minimum residual method, and oblimin rotation was applied to

160

improve interpretation. We explored a range between 1 and 12 factors and chose the

161

factor number based on Kaiser’s rule (i.e. keeping factors with eigenvalues at least 1), a

162

scree plot, the amount of total variance explained from each model produced, and the

163

interpretability of the factor structure. The chosen factor model is depicted in Fig 1. The

164

factor structures of the 4- and 6-factor models are shown in Figs S3 and S4 for

165

comparison purposes. The stability of the final factor model was examined by 2,000

Relationship between neighborhood latent variables and

180

mental health

181

The factor scores for each census tract were merged with data from the 500 Cities

182

Project, which provides tract-level mental health data for 27,204 tracts [11]. This project

183

used Small Area Estimation (SAE) to estimate prevalence of health issues. The SAE was

184

performed on datasets managed by the CDC, including the Behavioral Risk Factor

185

Surveillance System (BRFSS) [15]. The BRFSS was conducted by a telephone survey

186

interviewing approximately 400,000 adults across the United States and its territories

187

[16]. Iterative proportional fitting was used to weight statistics by age, gender, race and

188

ethnicity, and geographical region [17]. For the purposes of this study, we focused on

only one question in the BRFSS: “Now thinking about your mental health, which includes

190

stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30

191

days was your mental health not good?” The tract-level SAE from this question provided

192

an estimate of the proportion of individuals ≥18 years old within a tract who responded

193

that they had ≥14 bad mental health days. These estimates were linked to the

194

neighborhood factor scores and their associations were investigated descriptively by

195

smoothing splines.

196
197

Software

198

The statistical software R [18] was used for all data extraction, analyses, and the

199

generation of all figures. The R code for this manuscript is available as a supplement.

200

ACS data were obtained through the R package acs [19]. The e1071 (31) and scales (32)

201

packages were used for transformation, the DMwR package for imputation, and the psych

202

package [20] for factor analysis.

203
204

Results

205

Exploratory factor analysis

206

The scree plot shows that a factor model with up to eight factors had eigenvalues greater

207

than 1.0 and an ‘elbow’ at 5 factors (Fig S5). Together, these factors accounted for 60%

208

of the variance and reproduced 0.98 of the off-diagonal elements of the sample

209

correlation matrix, and 0.04 root-mean square of residuals (RMS). Fit statistics of the 12

210

factor models explored are given in Table S2. The five factors were labeled based on the

variables with the strongest absolute loadings as: (1) Affluence, (2) Singletons in Tract,

212

(3) African-Americans in Tract, (4) Seniors in Tract, and (5) Noncitizens in Tract (Fig

213

S6). Affluence, which accounted for 16% of the variance, showed greatest loadings from

214

tract statistics relating to NSES, such as income (0.79 for Income in the circle plot) and

215

education (0.73 for Education). Singletons in Tract, which accounted for 13% of the

216

variance, demonstrated strong loadings from the proportion of people living alone (0.81

217

for Lives.alone), the average number of housing units per structure (0.72 for

218

Units.in.structure), and the proportion of homes in a tract not occupied by their owner

219

(0.70 for Not.owner.occupied). African-Americans in Tract, which accounted for 11% of

220

the variance, was positively correlated with the proportion of black population (0.87 for

221

Black) and inversely correlated with the proportion of white population (-0.87 for White).

222

This factor was also highly correlated to proportion of single moms (0.69 for

223

Single.moms), a lack of married couple family homes (-0.49 for Married.spouse.present,

224

0.46 for Never.married), the unemployed population (0.49 for Unemployed), and the

225

proportion of people living on government assistance (0.37 for w.SSI, 0.34 for w.PAI).

226

Seniors in Tract, which accounted for 11% of the variance, was primarily related to age

227

(0.85 for Age) and the proportion of the population receiving Social Security Income

228

(0.87 for w.Social.Security). Noncitizens in Tract, which accounted for 9% of the

229

variance, was strongly related to the proportion of certain racial and ethnic minorities

230

(0.74 for Some.other.race, 0.83 for Hispanic.or.Latino) as well as the population of U.S.

231

citizens (0.76 for Not.US.citizen).

232
233

The oblique rotation procedure left the factors correlated (Fig S7): African-Americans in

234

Tract was correlated with Noncitizens in Tract (r = 0.36), Singletons in Tract (r = 0.33),

235

and Affluence (r = -0.29); Seniors in Tract was correlated with Noncitizens in Tract (r = -

236

0.26) and Affluence (r = -0.21). Least correlated were Noncitizens in Tract and Affluence

237

(r = -0.08).

238
239

Associations between neighborhood factors and prevalence of

240

poor mental health

241

The prevalence of individuals in a tract with 14 or more days of bad mental health

242

appeared to be most related to Affluence, followed by African-Americans in Tract,

243

Noncitizens in Tract, Singletons in Tract, and least related to Seniors in Tract (Fig 2).

244

There was an obvious inverse relationship between the bad mental health measure and

245

affluence of tracts for all states (median R-square 0.83 and inter-quartile range (IQR)

246

between 0.80 and 0.86, Fig S8). There also existed monotone, increasing trends between

247

the health measure and the two factors African-Americans in Tract (median and IQR R²:

248

0.67 (0.58, 0.74)) and Noncitizens in Tract (median and IQR R²: 0.49 (0.35, 0.67)),

249

despite higher variability in trends across states for the latter. Concave trends appeared

250

between the bad mental health outcome and Singletons in Tract for most states (median

251

and IQR R²: 0.17 (0.11, 0.24)). The uniform relationship for tracts with a lower

252

Singletons in Tract score indicates that neighborhoods with fewer singletons tend to have

253

lower rates of poor mental health. As the factor score increases, however, rates of mental

254

health become more variable, indicating there is no relationship between mental health

255

and a higher Singletons in tract score. Seniors in Tract showed different patterns across

Discussion

265

This study aimed to quantify neighborhood characteristics using a latent variable

266

approach performed on census data and to determine the utility of these latent variables

267

by relating them to mental health outcomes. There were two main results. First, five

268

factors, Affluence, Singletons in Tract, African-Americans in Tract, Seniors in Tract, and

269

Noncitizens in Tract, accounted for 60% of the neighborhood tract variance and provided

270

a multidimensional assessment of census tracts. Second, two of the five factors were

271

shown to be strongly related to tract-level descriptors of poor mental health: Affluence,

272

and African-Americans in Tract. Taken together, this study shows that census tracts can

273

be robustly quantified using five dimensions and that some of these latent variables are

274

strongly associated with tract-level mental health status.

275
276

Several studies have described the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and

277

mental health [8, 21, 22]. However, to our knowledge, no previous study has used a

278

factor analysis approach to extract a multi-dimensional set of latent variables for the

279

characterization of neighborhoods. A recent study by Hu et al. was published showing the

280

relationship between NSES and health [23]. However, the results of these analyses are

281

limited because– as in many other papers– only NSES was examined as a predictor of

282

health while the possible influence of other neighborhood characteristics was ignored.

283

Additionally, the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) used in this paper, developed by Singh

284

[24], was developed based on a single-factor analysis using 17 socioeconomic indicators

285

selected by Singh from the 1990 U.S. census, however time-invariance of the results of

286

the factor analysis was not tested. It is important that this statistic was not tested for time-

287

invariance, as assuming the factor structure is consistent over time may lead to biased

288

results if time invariance of the factor structure does not hold [25]. An index should be

289

based on data in the relevant time period if time-invariance has not been demonstrated. A

290

factor model can be easily calculated for any 5-year period after 2005 using the methods

291

we describe in this paper.

292
293

Our results indicate that our factors representing Affluence and African-Americans in

294

Tract are most predictive of mental health rates in a neighborhood. Furthermore, results

295

indicate the pattern each relationship follows. The relationship between African-

296

Americans in Tract and mental health appears linear, while the relationship between

297

Affluence and mental health appears to follow an exponential decay. Our four most

298

explanatory factors (Affluence, African-Americans in Tract, Singletons in Tract, and

299

Noncitizens in Tract), have all been explored to some extent in past research. Affluence

300

appears to be synonymous with such measures as socioeconomic status, economic

301

disadvantage, and neighborhood deprivation as described in several previous studies [8].

302

African-Americans in Tract and Noncitizens in Tract have also been explored in a few

303

past studies as ‘racial congruence’ or ‘ethnic diversity’, etc. [8]. Even Singletons in Tract

304

is representative, to an extent, of residential mobility or neighborhood stability [8]. The

305

only factor not explored in previous studies was the elderly population, which we have

306

shown to be uncorrelated with rates of mental health. The relationship of our factors to

307

interests of previous studies indicate that our factors are intuitively as well as objectively

308

descriptive of neighborhoods.

309
310

Limitations

311

The variables used in this study were limited to those collected by the U.S. census.

312

Consequently, there are some neighborhood characteristics shown in previous studies to

313

be related to mental health that are not included in this study. For example, this study

314

does not include walkability, neighborhood disorder, social factors, neighborhood

315

hazards, the built environment, or the service environment [8]. Even with these

316

limitations, the ACS dataset serves as a reliable source for neighborhood statistics. These

317

statistics include responses from millions of households across the U.S., the data are

318

collected consistently over time, and the statistics cover a broad range of characteristics.

319

Additionally, neighborhood characteristics based on subjective resident response may be

320

biased and misleading. For example, perception of neighborhood conditions has been

321

shown to be significantly correlated to rates of depression [8], but there is no assurance

322

that this relationship does not simply depict the poor outlook of those with depression.

324

Additionally, there exist some challenges from an analysis standpoint. The indeterminacy

325

problem is a well-known issue with factor analysis [26, 27]. Factor analysis results in

326

factors that must be subjectively defined. This has always been a fundamental problem of

327

factor analysis. However, the circle plots clearly depict what the factors represent.

328

Additionally, this problem is superseded by the utility of the latent variables over the raw

329

data. The latent variable structure, though vague, simplifies interpretability drastically.

330
331

Future directions

332

The influence of these factors at an individual level is still unknown. Jones et al. make a

333

point that people experience substantial segregation across a range of spaces, such as

334

areas of work or recreation, in their daily lives [28]. The extent to which an individual’s

335

neighborhood characteristics affect their mental health must be explored in future

336

longitudinal studies.

337
338

The 500-Cities data contains data on physical health as well as mental health. An

339

exploration on the relationship between the factors and the other statistics in the 500-

340

Cities dataset is given in Fig S9. It is clear from this plot that the factors relate to more

341

than just mental health.

342
343

Conclusion

344

Neighborhood factors based on census data provide comprehensive, objectively derived

345

neighborhood characteristics. To our knowledge, our work takes into consideration a

346

variety of neighborhood statistics not previously explored, while remaining simple and

347

highly interpretable. We intend that these factors may be used to further explore the

348

relationship between living environment and mental health. Our findings show that

349

neighborhood characteristics are strongly related to mental health, indicating the

350

importance of the factor model in future research focused on the influence of

351

neighborhood characteristics on mental health.
