Abstract

45

The large-scale patterns of movement for the Sharp-shinned Hawk (Accipiter striatus), a small

46

forest hawk found throughout western North America, are largely unknown. However, based on

47

field observations we set out to test the hypothesis that juvenile migratory A. striatus caught

48

along two distinct migration routes on opposite sides of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of North

49

America (Pacific Coast and Intermountain Migratory Flyways) come from different

50

natal/breeding populations. We applied Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA) of hydrogen (H) and

51

oxygen (O) of feathers, and large scale models of spatial isotopic variation (IsoScapes) to

52

formulate spatially explicit predictions of the origin of the migrant birds. For both hydrogen and

53

oxygen isotope composition, novel relationships were assessed between the measured isotope

54

values of feathers from A. striatus museum specimens of known origin and the IsoScape

55

modeled compositions of precipitation at those known locations. We used these relationships to

56

predict the origin regions for birds migrating along the two flyways from the measured isotope

57

values of migrant’s feathers and the associated hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of

58

precipitation where these feathers were formed. The A. striatus from the two migration routes

59

had overlap in their natal/breeding origins and did not differentiate into fully separate migratory

60

populations. The methodology based on oxygen isotopes had, in general, less predictive power

61

than the one based on hydrogen. There was broad agreement between the two isotope approaches

62

in the geographic assignment of the origins of birds migrating along the Pacific Coast Flyway,

63

but not for those migrating along the Intermountain Migratory Flyway. These results are

64

discussed in terms of their implications for conservation efforts of A. striatus in western North

65

America, and the use of combined hydrogen and oxygen SIA to track the movement of birds of

66

prey on continental scales.

Introduction

69

Thousands of bird species migrate, traveling from breeding territories to wintering grounds and

70

back annually, sometimes over great distances and geographical features [1]. Such seasonal

71

movement make the factors that stress populations of migratory birds difficult to track, as

72

individuals may be affected by changes at any point along their migratory route [2–4]. As a

73

result, understanding the migratory routes and connections between breeding and wintering sites

74

is critical for strategizing conservation and preservation actions for particular bird species, such

75

as raptors which are often secretive and breed over a wide area [5].

76

Migratory routes taken by different birds that follow similar pathways across continents

77

are identified as migratory “flyways”, which are hypothesized to represent the shortest and least

78

costly path over wide geographic distances [6]. Differences in the choice of migratory flyway

79

between and within species may represent evolutionary divergences related to specific

80

adaptations [7–9]. For some species, individuals that stray from or cross between flyways

81

experience higher costs to migration, therefore evolutionary associations are likely to exist

82

between populations of birds and specific migratory flyways [10–12]. One common way to

83

monitor populations of birds of prey is by tracking migratory movement at watch sites and

84

banding stations along migratory flyways [5, 13, 14]. Long-term data sets from raptor migration

85

watch-sites can indicate population dynamics for specific species and populations, which can

86

provide indications of changes in population size [15–19]. However, it can be difficult to connect

87

migrating birds to other geographic stages in their life cycle (breeding and wintering) through

88

these data, and without these connections it may be problematical to understand what factors

89

underlie population size changes [20].

90

The Sharp-shinned Hawk (Accipiter striatus) is a small, forest hawk found throughout

91

North America [21]. During breeding, A. striatus prefers dense coniferous and deciduous forests,

92

making nesting sites difficult to identify and survey, and breeding birds problematic to monitor

93

[21–23]. Heavy persecution resulting from the shooting of thousands along migration routes each

94

year in the late 19th and early 20th centuries [22, 24], combined with the effects of

95

dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) used as a pesticide in the early 20th century, resulted in

96

A. striatus numbers decreasing steadily across the species’ range [25]. However, over the past

97

several decades data from population and migratory monitoring of the species have shown

98

inconsistent and contrary trends of both significant increases and decreases [26, 13]. Since North

99

America’s smallest hawk is difficult to track on its breeding grounds, most population

100

monitoring occurs at watch and banding sites along migratory flyways. Connecting migratory

101

flyways and watch sites with specific breeding ranges will allow for a greater understanding of

102

wider populations trends for this secretive bird of prey.

103

Raptors in the western side of the North American continent are believed to travel along

104

three migratory flyways: the Pacific Coast, the Intermountain, and the Rocky Mountain Flyways

105

[12]. Band recovery data of A. striatus trapped at migration sites along each of the flyways have

106

shown demographic population differentiation along each route [12, 15, 27]. However, sample

107

sizes for band returns are often small and may therefore represent biased information [28].

108

Endogenous markers, such as genetic analysis and stable isotope analysis (SIA), are not able to

109

track the same fine-scale movements as extrinsic markers (i.e. bands, satellite telemetry), but are

110

easier and less expensive to use with large sample sizes, and can provide a larger return in data

111

for wide geographic areas [29–35]. Integrating information from both levels of analysis can

112

provide the best account of current population trends, and allow researchers to connect migratory

113

flyway monitoring data with information on geographical breeding areas.

114

Over the past few decades, a number of studies have used SIA of naturally occurring

115

hydrogen (H) of feathers in order to estimate migratory patterns and ecological connectivity

116

among habitats for a broad range of species of birds [36]. In comparison, only recently with

117

advances in continuous flow pyrolysis techniques have reliable SIA of oxygen (O) of organic

118

materials been possible. Therefore, much less data exist on the additional information that can be

119

obtained by measuring both elements to trace animal movements from different tissue types,

120

such as feathers and hair [37–40].

121

Keratin, the main chemical constituent of feathers, remains chemically inert following its

122

synthesis, and it incorporates hydrogen and oxygen from consumed water and dietary sources.

123

The stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions in the keratin of a feather (2HF and

124

18OF values) therefore become markers of the environmental conditions and will vary

125

geographically due to the spatial variation in the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic

126

composition of meteoric precipitation (2HP and 18OP values) [41]. This variation is caused

127

primarily by isotope effects associated with evaporation and condensation processes [42–44] and

128

correlates inversely with latitude and elevation across the continents [45]. Additionally, because

129

hydrogen and oxygen are incorporated or “routed” into organic compounds like keratin along

130

different metabolic pathways, the 2H and 18O of feather keratin may not provide the same

131

information even if these elements had their origin from the same water source.

132

Linking the isotopic composition of animal tissue to geographic locations of origin is

133

based on important assumptions, such as the presence of known and constant isotope effects

134

associated with tissue synthesis, and the knowledge of the relationship between the isotopic

135

compositions of the tissue and that of the environmental food web and water source signals [46,

136

39, 74]. However, work on some species of birds suggests a decoupling between hydrogen and

137

oxygen isotopes in food webs that might affect the usefulness of 18OF measurements for

138

assignment of bird origin [48, 49, 39].

139

Previous SIA studies have used 2HF values to estimate the timing and pattern of

140

migration for A. striatus from western North America [50, 51]. Birds migrating along the

141

Intermountain Flyway were found to originate from the Northern Rocky Mountain Range (Idaho

142

(ID) and Montana (MT)) in the United States of America (USA) north through British Columbia

143

(BC, Canada) [51]. Specific origins were not determined for birds caught along the Rocky

144

Mountain Flyway, but it has been shown that A. striatus followed a chain migration pattern

145

where individuals from lower latitudes migrated earlier than those from higher latitudes [50].

146

However, no work has been done to look at the origins of A. striatus from the Pacific Coast

147

Flyway or has incorporated two isotopes to trace the origin of birds from neighboring flyways.

148

Migration can be a difficult and dangerous behavior for birds, and specific adaptations for

149

breeding populations that use different flyways would be anticipated to lead to population

150

differentiation [52]. If flyways represent unique migratory paths for different populations, then it

151

can be predicted that A. striatus migrating along neighboring flyways should originate from

152

separate breeding origins, as hinted at by their band results [12, 15]. However, no genetic

153

difference has been found between A. striatus caught on migration along either flyway [53],

154

suggesting that birds that utilize the different routes overlap and intermix in their breeding

155

populations.

156
157

In this study, we used the variation in 2HF and 18OF values of A. striatus and large scale
models of spatial isotopic variation (IsoScapes) to: a) examine the origin of A. striatus caught

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/856278; this version posted November 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

158

along the Pacific Coast Flyway in comparison to birds caught along the Intermountain Flyway,

159

and b) determine the usefulness and areas of concern of using oxygen isotopes to determine the

160

origin of raptorial birds of prey. First, we established relationships, separately for hydrogen and

161

oxygen, between 2HF and 18OF values of A. striatus museum specimens from known

162

natal/breeding locations, to predict the isotope signatures of precipitation at the origin regions of

163

birds migrating along the Pacific Coast and Intermountain Flyways from the measured isotope

164

values of migrant’s feathers. Prediction of precipitation hydrogen and oxygen isotope

165

composition and assignment of migrating bird origin locations were accomplished using an

166

internet-based environmental water IsoScape of Western North America (htpp://isomap.org)

167

[54]. Finally, predictions of sites of origin based on 2HP and 18OP values were also compared.

168

Assuming that the choice of migratory flyway is driven by evolutionary processes [11],

169

and that it would be costly for individuals to jump between migratory routes, we predicted that A.

170

striatus caught along the Pacific Coast Flyway would originate from further west then those

171

caught along the Intermountain Flyway, and show little overlap in their determined

172

natal/breeding origins. However, instead the SIA revealed that birds from the Pacific Coast

173

Flyway origins extended further east then predicted, including into the Rocky Mountain Range

174

and the western interior of North America. We report that both hydrogen and oxygen isotopic

175

analysis with feathers can be used to determine the origin of migratory birds of prey, but that

176

caution must be taken when interpreting the outcome.

180

Contour feathers of A. striatus from the ventral sternal feather track (n = 48 total, n = 23

181

juveniles and n = 25 adults) were sampled from museum specimens of known collection locality

182

(Table 1, Fig 1). Feather samples of juvenile A. striatus were obtained from the following

183

museums in the USA: California Academy of Sciences (CAS), San Francisco, CA; Charles R.

184

Conner Museum, Pullman (CRCM), WA; Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ), University of

185

California, Berkeley, CA; San Diego Natural History Museum (SDNHM), San Diego, CA;

186

University of Wyoming Museum of Vertebrates (UWYMV), Laramie, WY. In order to acquire

187

samples that were representative of feathers grown on breeding and natal geographic regions of

188

interest, specimens were constrained by date of collection (15th March – 30th August), and

189

feather wear [55, 21, 56]. Feathers were also sampled from migrating juvenile A. striatus banded

190

at the Marin Headlands, Marin County, CA (Golden Gate Raptor Observatory (GGRO), Pacific

191

Coast Flyway, n = 20), and the Goshutes Mountains, Elko County, NV (HawkWatch

192

International (Goshutes), Intermountain Flyway, n = 10) between August 15, 1999 and October

193

15, 1999 (Table 2, see [53] for sampling protocol). The migratory birds used in this study were

194

collected with samples previously used to analyze the genetic population structure of A. striatus,

195

and so are known to be from the western genetic population [53]. However, the specific origin of

196

migrating individuals was unknown. No live birds were handled for the described study.

197

Sampling of birds at banding stations was performed in 1999, and feathers used in this study

198

were from archived collections. Information on specimen numbers from each museum can be

199

found in Table 1, and band numbers for each banded bird in Table 2.

Sample preparation and SIA

226

Feathers were cleaned by immersion in a chloroform:methanol 2:1 (v/v) solution for 24 hours,

227

and then again for 1 hour, to remove lipids and mites. After each wash the feathers were air dried

228

for 24 hours [57–58]. The barbs were removed from the rachis, minced, and 1.5-2.0 mg of

229

feather material was packed into 3.5 x 5 mm silver (for stable oxygen isotopic measurement) or

230

tin (for stable hydrogen isotopic measurement) capsules. Previous work on other species of

231

raptors has found that breeding condition and age may affect 2HF values differently in juvenile

232

versus adults [59–61]. Therefore, only samples from juvenile individuals were analyzed for both

233

18OF and 2HF values (museum: n = 23, migratory: n = 21). Since there is no information about

234

life stage effects on the feather oxygen isotope composition of A. striatus, samples from adult

235

birds of known origin (n = 25) were also analyzed for 18OF measurement (Table 1).

The stable isotope abundances are presented in δ notation as deviations from the

237

standard reference (V-SMOW) in parts per thousand (‰) according to the following equation: δ

238

X = (Rsample/Rstandard) -1) where X represents 2H or 18O, and R the ratio of the heavy and light

239

isotope (e.g., 18O/16O) in the sample and in the standard, respectively.

240

The 18O measurements were performed at the Center for Stable Isotope

241

Biogeochemistry (University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA) using a PYRO Cube

242

(Elementar, Hanau, Germany) interfaced to a Thermo Delta V mass spectrometer (Thermo

243

Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The 2H measurements were carried out

244

at the Cornell Isotope Laboratory (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA) using a Temperature

245

Conversion Elemental Analyzer (TC/EA) interfaced to a Thermo Delta V mass spectrometer

246

(both from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Reference materials

247

of kudu horn and caribou hoof keratins (KHS and CBS) [62] were used as quality control

248

materials for both hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope measurements, and the precision of the

249

analysis was ± 2.8‰ and 0.30‰ for hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. To correct the measured

250

hydrogen isotope ratios for the contribution of exchangeable hydrogen atoms to the total number

251

of hydrogen atoms in feathers (~15%) [47, 62, 63], samples were allowed to equilibrate with the

252

laboratory ambient atmosphere along with KHS and CBS standards for a minimum of 72 hours

253

before isotopic analysis [63].

254

A linear regression approach was used to examine the relationship between measured

255

δ2HF and δ18OF values from A. striatus feathers for museum samples of known natal/breeding

256

origin as well as in birds sampled at the two migratory banding sites.

H and O precipitation IsoScapes for Accipiter striatus museum

259

samples of known natal/breeding origin

260

IsoMAP, a web resource for IsoScapes modeling, (http://www.waterisotopes.org)[64], was used

261

to predict the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of precipitation (2HP and δ18OP

262

values) at the locations where museum specimens were collected. IsoScapes are gridded surfaces

263

representing spatially explicit isotope distributions across a landscape [46, 65]. IsoMAP software

264

creates water IsoScapes by using precipitation isotope data from the Global Network for Isotopes

265

in Precipitation (GNIP) database administered by the International Atomic Energy Association

266

and World Meteorological Organization [66]. Within IsoMAP, numerous parameters can be

267

selected to create an IsoScape model that is the best fit for a specific study area and time period

268

since the geographical variation of δ2HP and δ18OP values depend on a range of geographic and

269

meteorological effects including latitude, season, elevation, and regional air mass circulation.

270

Independently for each isotope, we modeled the geographic distribution of 2HP and δ18OP values

271

across North America using precipitation data collected from 1960–1999 during the months from

272

March to September to represent the plant growing season [67]. The hydrogen and oxygen

273

IsoScape models were further analyzed using the spatial software ArcGIS (ESRI 2010). In

274

particular, we limited the spatial isotopic predictions to the known habitat range of A. striatus

275

using a geographic information system (GIS) layer of range delineation provided by Birdlife

276

International and NatureServe [68]. In addition, because this species is found to nest specifically

277

in forests [21], we applied a GIS biome layer to exclude non-breeding habitat, such as tundra,

278

open water, desert, and grassland from potential sites of origin [69].

Predicting the origin of migrating Accipiter striatus

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/856278; this version posted November 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

281

Because of isotope discrimination during feather formation and other effects, the isotope values

282

of feathers may not directly reflect the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of the

283

environmental water at the site where they are formed [70–71]. We estimated the magnitude of

284

such discrimination factors for A. striatus feathers by calculating the linear relationship between

285

the isotopic signatures of feathers from museum specimens of known origin (2HF and 18OF)

286

and the corresponding IsoScape predicted precipitation values (2HP and 18OP) at the location

287

where the museum specimens were collected [72–74]. Metadata associated with each specimen

288

included the uncertainty for the collection location in meters. When multiple IsoScape derived

289

2HP and 18OP grid values were available within the radius of uncertainty around a collection

290

location, we used the average isotope values within this radius.

291

The parameters of the linear regression equations derived from the museum specimens

292

data were used to predict the isotopic composition of the precipitation at the site of origin of

293

birds sampled at each of the two migratory banding sites (GGRO and Goshutes). The feather

294

isotopic compositions of the migrating birds represented the input variable x, and the response

295

variable y yielded an estimate of the associated 2HP or 18OP values. Resulting 2HP and 18OP

296

values thus represented the water source isotope signatures expected for the localities where the

297

feathers of migrating birds were formed. The linear regressions were used as a transfer function

298

to convert feather isotope values for migratory birds to precipitation isotopes values at the sites

299

of origin [75].

300

To determine if the origin for birds migrating through the GGRO and Goshutes sites

301

differed, we examined the data in several ways. First, we calculated the frequency distributions

302

of the predicted precipitation isotope values for the two migratory banding sites. Second,

303

predicted 2HP and 18OP values for each migrant group (GGRO and Goshutes) were compared

304

statistically using Welches unequal variance T-test and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution test.

305

Finally, we utilized the IsoMAP geographic assignment function to produce maps representing

306

the likelihood of origin for the migrant birds sampled at GGRO and Goshutes.

307

The assignment function in IsoMAP uses a semi-parametric Bayesian framework to

308

model probability density surfaces that can be used to determine geographic areas where organic

309

material, such as bird feathers, were developed [75, 76]. The assignment function requires an

310

observed sample isotopic composition and a standard deviation associated with the environment

311

to sample transfer. For each of the birds sampled at GGRO and Goshutes, 2HP and 18OP values

312

were estimated using the feather to precipitation linear regressions. The residual standard error

313

(RSE) of each linear regression was used as the estimate of precision. Additional uncertainty

314

associated with the precipitation isoscape is automatically included in the assignment algorithm.

315

Finally, following [76], rather than creating average probability surfaces for each migratory

316

group though the bulk sample function probability surfaces were generated for each individual

317

bird. The individual probability density maps were then averaged for GGRO and Goshutes

318

groups. Using ArcGIS, individual rasters within each group were summed together and then

319

normalized by the sum of all cell values in the final surface. This process resulted in geographic

320

representations of the likely origin of A. striatus migrating along the Pacific Coast and the

321

Intermountain Flyways. Areas outside the species range and nesting habitat type were not

322

included as likely origin areas of the migratory birds. All statistics were performed in R (R

323

version 2.14.0) [77].

The stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of feathers of juvenile A. striatus

327

museum specimens varied from -134.4 to -26.9 ‰ for 2HF and from 8.62 to 22.22 ‰, for 18OF

328

respectively (n = 23) (Table 1). A significant and positive relationship was found between the

329

2HF and δ18OF values from feathers (R2 = 0.48, P < 0.001, y = 6.33(x) – 164.06) (Fig 2).

334

Comparisons of different precipitation isotope models available in IsoMAP revealed that

335

the most robust IsoScapes that represented 2HP and δ18OP values across North America were

336

kriging interpolation models. The 2HP IsoScape produced was based on 117 stations, had

337

resolution of 9x9 km, a correlation parameter of 0.93, and included the variables elevation

338

(ETOPO, P < 0.001), latitude (P < 0.001) and longitude (P = 0.06) (IsoMAP job key 50333).

339

The most robust 18OP IsoScape was based on 120 stations, had resolution of 9x9 km, a

340

correlation parameter of 0.92, and included the variables elevation (ETOPO, P < 0.001), latitude

341

(P < 0.001) and longitude (P = 0.05) (IsoMAP job key 63026).

342

In museum feather samples from juvenile A. striatus, the mean 2HF value was -80.48 ±

343

29.0 (n = 23), and the mean 18OF value was 13.29 ± 3.2 (n = 23) (Table 1). We found positive

344

relationships between the feather isotope values and the IsoScape modeled precipitation isotope

345

values for the A. striatus museum specimen of known origin. The linear regression between 2HF

346

and 2HP values was statistically significant (n = 23, R2 = 0.46, P < 0.001, y = 0.58x – 36.64)

347

(Fig 3a), while the linear regressions between 18OF and 18OP values based on feathers of only

348

juvenile birds (Fig 3b) or only adults (not shown) were not statistically significant and produced

349

similar equation coefficients (n = 23, R2 = 0.14, P = 0.08, y = 0.33x - 15.42 for juveniles; n = 25,

350

R2 = 0.14, P = 0.07, y = 0.31x - 14.23 for adults). However, when the oxygen isotope data for

351

both juvenile and adult museum specimens were combined, the linear regression was statistically

352

significant, even though the equation parameters of the regression including adults and juveniles

353

were nearly identical to those of the separate regressions for adults and for juveniles (n = 48, R2

354

= 0.14, P = 0.008, y = 0.35x - 14.46) (Fig 3c).

of juvenile (filled circle) and adult (open circle) birds (n = 48) versus δ18OP values.

363

In migratory bird feathers, the mean δ2HF value was -82.36 ± 38.8 at GGRO (n = 15) and

364

-124.41 ± 8.2 at Goshutes (n = 7). The mean 18OF value was 14.78 ± 3.5 at GGRO (n = 19) and

365

8.19 ± 2.7 at Goshutes (n = 10) (Table 2). Within the set of migratory birds for which both

366

hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions were measured, there was a positive relationship

367

between 2HF and 18OF values at both the GGRO and Goshutes banding sites (Fig 4). The

368

linear relationship between 2HF and 18OF values for the birds captured at the GGRO was very

369

similar to that found for the museum bird feathers (n = 14, R2 = 0.40, P = 0.016, Fig 4a).

370

However, the relationship between 2HF and 18OF values for the birds migrating through the

371

Goshutes banding site was not statistically significant (n = 7, R2 = 0.18, P = 0.34, Fig 4b).

391

probability surfaces shows that the origin of the individuals captured along the Pacific Coast

392

Flyway are most likely from eastern CA, Oregon (OR), and Washington (WA) as well as some

393

forested areas within NV, Utah (UT), Colorado (CO), Montana (MT), Idaho (ID), Wyoming

394

(WY), British Columbia (Canada), and southern Alaska (AK) (Fig 6a). For the birds that

395

migrated through the Goshutes banding site, the predicted 2HP values were less varied than at

396

the GGRO, ranging between -103.0 and -115.8‰ (Table 2 and Fig 5c). The average probability

397

density surface suggests that Intermountain Flyway captured birds originated from a smaller area

398

focused primarily in eastern WA, WY, MT, ID, British Columbia (Canada), and in southern AK

399

(Fig 6c). The predicted mean δ2HP values were statistically different between the GGRO and

400

Goshutes sites (Welch’s two-sample t-test, t = 4.01, df = 16.5, P = 0.001, data not shown). Also,

401

there was a significant difference in the distribution of the 2HP values for the two migratory

402

flyways (Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D = 0.73, P = 0.005).

from eastern CA, OR, NV, UT, CO, MT, WA, coastal British Columbia (Canada) and southern

423

AK (Fig 6b). These predicted origins, in general, confirmed the predictions found from the 2H

424

analysis. Predicted 18OP values at the origin sites of the birds captured at Goshutes ranged from

425

-7.83 to -10.74‰ (Table 2 and Fig 5d). The average probability density surface based on oxygen

426

isotopes located the natal origins of Goshutes birds in more coastal and southern areas then those

427

from the 2H analysis, including CA, NV, UT, CO, OR, WA, British Columbia (Canada), and

428

small portions of AK (Fig 6d). Although a subsample of birds captured at the GGRO site showed

429

depleted 18OF signatures compared to the Goshutes birds (Fig 5b and c), the mean 18OP values

430

did not differ statistically between sites (Welch’s two-sample t-test, t = -1.38, df = 23.4, P =

431

0.18). Also, we did not detect any significant difference in the distribution of the 18OP values for

432

the migratory flyways (Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D = 0.42, P = 0.16), despite the

433

potentially bimodal distribution of the predicted 18OP values for the GGRO (Fig 5b).

Discussion
Results from the combined SIA of hydrogen and oxygen of A. striatus feathers showed

437

that some raptors migrating along the Pacific Coast Flyway have origins that overlap with those

438

of raptors migrating along the Intermountain Flyway. Our prediction that birds that traveled

439

along each migratory route would come from different and non-overlapping breeding/natal

440

origins was therefore not supported. Instead it appears that migratory A. striatus juveniles,

441

specifically those from the northern Rocky Mountain Range and western interior regions of

442

North America, may travel along either flyway (Fig 6).

443

This outcome should be taken into consideration for conservation of A. striatus in

444

western North America, as individual populations may not show specific adaptations or fidelity

445

for movement along a single migratory flyway [7, 10, 11]. Instead, adjustments to their migration

446

strategy may depend on a multitude of ecological factors, such as minimization of energy cost

447

and mortality risk [78]. Juvenile raptors have also been found to have a greater degree of

448

variation in their migratory movement then adults [79], perhaps leading juvenile A. striatus to

449

wander between flyways during their first migration. As a result, movement across multiple

450

flyways should be heeded when examining data from migratory watch and banding sites, and

451

when using this data to estimate population size and fluctuations.

452

In agreement with previous studies, we found that both stable hydrogen and oxygen

453

isotopic composition of feathers can be used to predict the origin of birds across broad spatial

454

scales [39, 40]. However, the methodology based on oxygen had, in general, less predictive

455

power than the one based on hydrogen. Within the overall finding of common origins for the

456

birds migrating along western migratory flyways in North America, some differences were found

457

in the predicted breeding/natal sites depending on which isotope and migratory route were

458

examined.

459
460

Assignment of origin

461

We found an overlap in natal /breeding origin of A. striatus from both Flyways based on

462

hydrogen and oxygen IsoScapes (Fig 6). Birds migrating along the Pacific Coast Flyway

463

originated from a larger area that covered both the coastal and central areas of the species’

464

western range while A. striatus migrating along the Intermountain Flyway had a more limited

465

geographical origin.

466
467

Both IsoScape approaches point to similar predicted natal/breeding areas for A. striatus
migrating along the Pacific Coast Flyway (Fig 6a and b) in forest sites in CA, NV, OR, WA, ID,

468

and British Columbia (Canada). The origins of the migrants from the Intermountain Flyway

469

predicted from the oxygen IsoScape also included forests in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade

470

mountains, spanning through CA, OR, and WA up into British Columbia (Fig 6d). This expands

471

the breeding territory of the migratory individuals from the Intermountain Flyway westward

472

from our hypothesized origins, placing them closer to the west coast of North America, and

473

creates substantial overlap with the breeding origins of those from the Pacific Coast Flyway. In

474

contrast, the origin sites for the Intermountain Flyway indicated using the hydrogen IsoScape lie

475

along our predicted areas of natal/breeding origin, and agree with previously published data from

476

Lott and Smith [51], which identified forests in the states of ID, MT, and British Columbia as

477

origins for A. striatus migrating through this flyway (Fig 6c). As a result, the hydrogen IsoScape

478

revealed limited overlap in the origins of the two flyways in the central areas of the species

479

western range. The weak relationship between the migrant’s 2HF and 18OF values may account

480

for this discrepancy (Fig 4), however weak correlations between 2H and 18O have not hindered

481

previous studies that looked at the origin of birds in Europe and Asia [40].

482

The successful use of SIA of hydrogen and oxygen to assign sites of origin for migratory

483

animals depends on understanding the relationship between isotopic values in tissues and the

484

isotopic values of waters sources within the landscape where these tissues were formed. Isotopic

485

composition of animal tissues are offset from environmental isotope values due to a variety of

486

discrimination factors such as metabolic processes and diet [80]. These discrimination processes

487

vary among specific isotopes. In this study, the relationship between the stable hydrogen and

488

oxygen isotope composition of feathers differed depending on sampling locality. This

489

relationship was stronger for both museum specimens of known origin (R2 = 0.46) and birds

490

migrating through the Pacific Coast Migratory Flyways (R2 = 0.40) (Fig 2 and Fig 4a), than for

491

birds traveling along the Intermountain Flyway (R2 = 0.18) (Fig 4b). Research on other species

492

of vertebrates that compared 18O and 2H values in feathers, claws, or hair have also found both

493

strong and weak correlation patterns between the two isotopic compositions. Significant

494

correlations between 18O and 2H values were found for insectivorous passerines (R2 = 0.34)

495

[37] and falcons (R2 = 0.64 and R2 = 0.48)[81, 48], as well as for herbivorous mammals and one

496

species of mammalian carnivore (R2 = 0.84, 0.57, and 0.20) [37]. However, no significant

497

correlations were found between tissue oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions for other

498

vertebrate species, including Pumas [37] and European Cranes [40]. Our study is the first to

499

report that birds of the same species sampled along different migrating routes can show different

500

relationships between 2HF and 18OF values.

501

The small sample size of birds captured along the Intermountain Flyways may also

502

account for the poor relationship between the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition in

503

feathers. These samples were restricted to a single year of migratory data to coincide with

504

sampling strategy of published genetic data and ensure that all the birds sampled belonged to the

505

previously characterized A. striatus western population [53]. It may be possible that the

506

individuals analyzed here represented a divergence from the average value for the site that could

507

have been detected with a larger sample size [48]. However, the predicted origins from our

508

assignments based on hydrogen isotopes align very closely with previously published work for

509

A. striatus from the same flyway also based on hydrogen isotopes [51]. This suggests that despite

510

a small sample size, our results agree with previous findings of origin of birds from the

511

Intermountain Flyway. In general, increasing the migrant sample sizes from both flyways may

512

improve the precision in assigning birds to geographic origin. In addition, obtaining similar

513

results from multiple isotopes over multiple years would provide greater confidence in origin

514

maps for migratory species and are worth pursuing in future studies.

515

In summary, birds caught along the Pacific Coast Flyway have origins that overlap with

516

those birds caught along the Intermountain Flyway. Overall birds that originate from the Rocky

517

Mountain Range of North America appear to choose to travel through either migration route, but

518

discrepancies in the predicted origins based on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes encourage caution,

519

and further studies in how A. striatus migrate in western North America.

520
521
522

Feather isotope composition and life history factors
Our understanding is still poor about why the strong correlation between δ18O and δ2H in

523

meteoric (source) water [44] breaks down in the tissues of different groups of vertebrates.

524

Isotopic variability has been observed in 2HF values for wild American Kestrels (Falco

525

sparverius) at a local scale [59], and in 2HF and 18OF values in laboratory-controlled groups of

526

House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) [73] and Japanese Quail (Cortunix japonica) [82]. This

527

variability is thought to be due to differences in diet and water requirements, seasonal timing of

528

water use, metabolism, and evaporative cooling effects, among other factors [82, 83].

529

A variety of factors may have contributed to the different predictive ability of 18OF and

530

2HF values in A. striatus. Carnivorous animals, including birds, are known to show enriched

531

2H signatures in bone collagen compared to source water [84], and hydrogen isotopic

532

composition in organic tissue seem to be influenced more by the diet consumed than the water

533

used, compared to the oxygen isotopic composition in the same tissue [74, 85, 82, 83]. In

534

addition, consuming prey from different trophic levels (herbivores vs. insectivores) might affect

535

the isotopic signatures for hydrogen and oxygen isotopes differently for a raptor such as A.

536

striatus. Climatic factors may also play a role in the development of different isotopic signatures

537

for raptorial birds from different habitats on the continent. Climate and aridity can have profound

538

effects on the degree of variation (fractionation) of water 18O values measured in animal body

539

water [81, 86, 87], as well as the proportion of drinking versus metabolically produced water in

540

the body-water pool [82]. Moreover, previous work analyzing isotopic information for a variety

541

of raptor species across North America found 2HF values enriched for birds from the northern

542

ranges of the Rocky Mountains in ID and MT compared to 2HP values at the same locations

543

[51]. More work is needed examining the effects of diet and climate on isotopic signatures for

544

birds from different trophic levels to determine if prey, habitat, or both, may play a role in

545

variation in 2H and 18O isotope signatures.

546

The age of the animal has also been found to have a significant affect on the 2HF value

547

for birds, with adults showing enriched isotopic signatures relative to younger animals [60, 88–

548

89]. Previous studies on breeding populations of know origins suggested a link between high

549

variability in adult 2HF values, and breeding behavior and physiological effort during the

550

breeding season [59, 61]. Little work has been done using oxygen variation to determine origin

551

of birds from different age classes. While we did not assess the origin of adult A. striatus

552

migratory samples, our results for museum samples of known origin show no significant

553

difference in the relationship found between 18OF and predicted 18OP for adult and juvenile A.

554

striatus (Fig 3b and c). This suggests that 18OF values of adult predatory birds may not be

555

affected by the enrichment seen in tissue 2H, perhaps because 18O values are more strongly

556

influenced by environmental water then diet [83], and are not as affected by evaporative,

557

metabolic, and respiratory water losses [61].

558

Research focused on the relationship between the known origin of a bird, its

559

physiological condition, aspects of its behavior, and its diet and drinking regime will no doubt

560

improve our understanding of what “sets” the oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition in

561

feathers. In addition, previous work has identified that the determination of origin for species of

562

various trophic levels is improved when species specific calibration curves for hydrogen are

563

included [48, 90]. Ideally, species specific fractionation factors for hydrogen and oxygen

564

isotopes should be considered along with isotopic variation observed in birds due to differences

565

in age and trophic level. Further research that examines how these variables affect the

566

fractionation factors for hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses will be essential before we can

567

use hydrogen or oxygen as a reliable tool for examining the origin of all birds. The results from

568

this study on A. striatus are encouraging.

569
570
571

Uncertainties in IsoScape modeling methodology
IsoMAP allows users to create and test large scale models of spatial isotopic variation for

572

a specific area of interest. IsoMAP also allows creation of probability density maps to show

573

uncertainty due to sample variability. It is known that predictions based on IsoScape modeling

574

methodology might be affected by several factors. The IsoScapes created for this study in

575

IsoMAP.com are based on precipitation isotope ratio values collected through a global network

576

of stations [66]. However, the global sampling of precipitation isotope ratios used for the

577

IsoScape predictions is spatially and temporally uneven [64]. Therefore, the trends of 2HP and

578

18OP values can be relatively robust on large scales, but they may not capture the variability

579

present at more limited spatial or temporal scales [65]. This can make attribution challenging or

580

less precise.

581

Other sources of uncertainty in precipitation isotope values modeled using IsoScapes are

582

due to large grid sizes, the integration of isotope data over multiple years, and the interpolation

583

model error. Collection location uncertainty, especially for museum specimens that may have a

584

location description that is not geographically specific, should also be taken into account. Spatial

585

and temporal resolution could be improved by the addition of quality precipitation isotope data to

586

the existing network through platforms like IsoMAP [65].

Conclusion
Our assignment evaluation demonstrates that the hypothesis that juvenile migratory A.

590

striatus birds caught along two distinct migration routes on opposite sides of the Sierra Nevada

591

Mountains of North America (Pacific Coast and Intermountain Migratory Flyways) come from

592

different natal/breeding populations can be rejected (Fig 6). We found an overlap in the assigned

593

natal/breeding territories of the migrating birds from the two migration routes. Birds captured

594

along the Pacific Coast Flyway had a range of 2HF and 18OF values that were consistent with

595

precipitation found not only along the west coast, but also in the interior regions in the US and

596

Canada. The birds migrating along the Intermountain Flyway had a more limited geographical

597

origin that also differed if predicted based on SIA of hydrogen or oxygen. The methodology

598

based on oxygen appeared to have less predictive power than the one based on hydrogen because

599

of the weaker relationships linking feather oxygen isotopes to those in precipitation.

600

We conclude that juvenile migrating A. striatus in western North America do not

601

differentiate into fully separate migratory populations. For this difficult-to-track and secretive

602

breeding raptor, our data can provide clues to the origins of birds caught along these two

603

migration routes, and that consideration must be given to both flyways when examining changes

604

in population size at breeding origins, especially along the Rocky Mountain Range and in the

605

interior western regions of the species’ range. However, further work will need to be done, with

606

larger sample sizes, to determine what may be driving the lack of correlation found between the

607

feather hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope compositions of A. striatus that migrate through the

608

Intermountain Flyway.

609

Results from this study corroborate previous work showing that feather isotopes can be

610

useful for identifying sites of origin for migrating birds, but also highlight that caution must be

611

taken when interpreting the outcome, especially if derived by the stable oxygen isotope

612

composition of feathers. Detailed studies on the sources of isotope variation at stages along the

613

path of ingestion and assimilation of water into body tissues, including different trophic levels,

614

life history stages, and geographic complexity, could provide insight for a wider application of

615

SIA of hydrogen and oxygen to track movement of different organisms, and especially wild

616

populations. Identification of breeding habitats has important conservation implications,

617

specifically because the movement of migratory species can often span across large geographic

618

areas and international borders. Organization of conservation efforts for such species requires a

619

precise understanding of movement patterns and connections between breeding sites, migratory

620

pathways, and wintering grounds. The continual development and testing of intrinsic methods,

621

such as stable isotopes, to track animals using feathers or hair can greatly improve our insight

622

into how animals, such as raptors like A. striatus, travel and move across their ranges.
