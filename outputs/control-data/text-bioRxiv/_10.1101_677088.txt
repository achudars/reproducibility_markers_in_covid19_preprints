Abstract

41

Objective: Shigellosis has been a heavy burden in China. However, its relative transmissibility in male

42

and female individuals remains unclear.

43

Method: A sex-based Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious/Asymptomatic–Recovered (SEIAR) model was

44

applied to explore the dataset of reported shigellosis cases built by Hubei Province from 2005 to 2017. Two

45

indicators, secondary attack rate (SAR) and relative ratio of SAR between males and females, were

46

developed to assess the relative transmissibility in males and females.

47

Results: The number of cases and reported incidences in males and females demonstrated a significant

48

decreasing trend (Male trend: χ2 = 11.268, P = 0.001, Female trend: χ2 = 11.144, P = 0.001). SEIAR model

49

had a great fitting effect with the data of shigellosis (P < 0.001). Our simulation revealed that, when

50

parameter βfm = 0, the greatest decrease in cases were obtained for different genders. The median value for

51

SARmm was 2.3225  10-8 (Range: 1.7574  10-8 – 3.8565  10-8), SARmf was 2.5729  10-8 (Range: 1.3772

52

 10-8 – 3.2773  10-8), SARfm was 2.7630  10-8 (Range: 1.8387  10-8 – 4.2638  10-8) and SARff was

53

2.1061  10-8(Range: 1.0201  10-8 – 3.2140  10-8). The median value of relative ratio calculated by SAR

54

in mm versus (vs) mf was 0.93 (Range: 0.75 – 1.47), mm vs fm was 0.90 (Range: 0.41 – 1.81), mm vs ff was

55

1.07 (Range: 0.55 – 2.93), mf vs fm was 0.99 (Range: 0.32 – 1.25), mf vs ff was 1.17 (Range: 0.43 – 3.21)

56

and ff vs fm was 0.75 (Range: 0.35 – 1.06).

57

Conclusion: Transmissibility of shigellosis is different among male and female individuals. Shigellosis

58

seems to be more transmissible in males than in females.

Introduction

76

Shigellosis, also known as bacillary dysentery, is an infectious disease caused by the genus Shigella

77

spp, and often occurs in summer and autumn. Shigella flexneri is the main cause of endemic diarrhoea in

78

low and middle income countries, and lays a heavy burden on these countries, especially in children aged

79

1-4 years old [1]. According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, about

80

150,000~450,000 cases were reported annually within the period 2005 to 2014 [2]. Although there has been

81

an improvement in the quality of water and sanitaion, shigellosis remains a major public health problem in

82

some developing countries, including China [3, 4].

83

Bacillary dysentery is an intestinal infectious disease, which can be transmitted via the consumption of

84

contaminated food or water [5]. Humans are the only natural host for shigella. Shigellosis has low

85

infectious dose and transmission primarily occurs from person-to-person [1]. Previously, a study was done

86

[6] in China during which it was evaluated that, contaminated water and food hardly contributed to

87

shigellosis. According to these reports, the incidence rate of bacillary dysentery is higher in males than in

88

females [7]. So, was there a shift route in the transmission of shigellosis in developing countries? What is

89

the process of transmission among individuals? What caused the different incidence in males and females?

90

The distribution of time and space were focused more in the model studies of shigellosis, while

91

population-based research was less [8-12]. Studies have showed that the Susceptible–Exposed–

92

Infectious/Asymptomatic–Recovered–Water (SEIARW) model has a great fitting effect [6]. However, it

93

does not estimate the transmissibility of bacillary dysentery between males and females. Therefore, a new

94

model–SEIAR, is formed by simplifying the SEIARW model. We adopted secondary attack rate (SAR) to

95

quantify the infectivity of shigellosis and relative ratio to assess the transmissibility of shigellosis between

96

males and females.

97

In this study, we collected Shigellosis cases reported in Hubei Province, China, adopted SEIAR model

98

to fit the data, calculated related index and figured out the transmissibility of shigellosis between males and

99

females.

101

Materials and Methods

102

Data sources

103

A dataset of shigellosis reported cases built by Hubei Province from January 2005 to December 2017,

104

were collected from China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. We cleared up the date

105

and sex (male or female) of onset of illness for each case. The informations of the population such as, birth

106

rate, death rate and total population were obtained from Hubei Statistical Yearbook.

107

Shigellosis model between different genders

108

According to a new review [1], the transmission of shigellosis is mainly from person-to-person in

109

developed countries. Therefore, the SEIAR model was developed according to the natural history of

110

shigellosis between male and female individuals (Figure 1). The pattern followed by the model was from

111

person-to-person, which contained susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic (I), asymptomatic (A), and

112

recovered (R) individuals (Table 1). We used the subscript m to represent male and f to represent female. In

113

the model, we assumed that:

114

a) Relative rate of transmission among male and female individuals was βm and βf, respectively;

115

b) Relative rate of transmission from male to female was βmf and from female to male was βfm.

116

We assumed that in both males and females:

117

a) The disease does not spread vertically, and the individuals born in various groups are all susceptible.

118
119

The natural birth rate is br, and the natural mortality rate is dr;
b) The proportion of latency patients (1-p)E (0 ≤ p ≤ 1) will change to infected person I after one

120

incubation period, while another part of the latent pE will become a latent infected person A after an

121

incubation period. Therefore, at time t, the speed from E to I is proportional to the latency group, the

122

proportional coefficient is (1-p)ω, and the speed from E to A is proportional to the latency population, and

123

the proportional coefficient is pω;

124
125

c) The speeds removed from I and A are proportional to the number of people in both groups, and the
proportional coefficients are γ and γ', respectively.

The left side of the equation shows the instantaneous rate of change of S, E, I, A and R at time t. In the

139

equations, the parameters βm, βf, βmf, βfm, k, ω, p, f, γ and γ’ refer to relative rate of transmission in males,

relative rate of transmission in females, relative rate of transmission from male to female, relative rate of

148

relative ratio by the equation as follows:

150

𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑚𝑓 = 𝛽𝑚𝑓𝑆𝑓 × 1/(𝛾 ∗ 𝑁𝑓)

𝑚𝑓 𝑣𝑠 𝑓𝑓 = 𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑚𝑓/𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑓𝑓

158

𝑓𝑓 𝑣𝑠 𝑓𝑚 = 𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑓𝑓/𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑓𝑚

159

In the equation, we defined the subscripts; mm, ff, mf and fm as among males, among females, from

160

female to male, and from male to female, respectively. mm vs mf , mm vs fm, mm vs ff, mf vs fm, mf vs ff

161

and ff vs fm refer to mm, ff , mf and fm, which have similar definitions as with the subscript of SAR.

162

Estimation of Parameters

163

According to epidemiological characteristics of shigellosis and previous study [6], we set k, ω, γ and γ’

164

as 0.3125, 1.0000, 0.0741 and 0.0286, respectively. The proportions of asymptomatic individuals were

165

reported to range from 0.0037 to 0.2700 [13-15]. We set p = 0.1 in SEIAR model. The fatality rate of the

166

disease reported in a study decreased from 0.00031 to 0.00088 from 1991 to 2000 [16]. Considering

167

the fatality rate of shigellosis is extremely low, we set f = 0. The values of βm, βf, βmf and βfm were

168

generated by curve fitting using SEIAR model and reported shigellosis data. In order to simulate the

169

contribution of βm, βf, βmf and βfm during the transmission, we performed a “knock-out” simulation in five

170

scenarios: A) βm = 0; B) βmf = 0; C) βf = 0; D) βfm = 0; E) control (no intervention).

Results

184

Epidemiological characteristics of shigellosis reported cases

185

From 2005 to 2017, 130770 shigellosis cases (including 73981male cases and 56789 female cases)

186

were reported in Hubei province (Figure 2). The median of incidences reported annually was 21.68 per

187

100000 persons (range: 6.10 – 32.63 per 100000 persons) in males and 17.91 per 100000 persons (range:

188

5.87 – 26.51 per 100000 persons) in females. It demonstrated that, the number of cases and reported

189

incidences in males and females had significantly decreased. (Male trend: χ2 = 11.268, P = 0.001, Female

190

trend: χ2 = 11.144, P = 0.001).

191

Curve fitting results

192

The results of curve fitting showed that the SEIAR model fitted the data well (Figure 3). The R2 of

193

SEIAR model of different genders each year were shown in Table 1. The model had a great fitting effect

194

with the data of shigellosis (Supplementary Table 1).

195

The transmissibility of shigellosis

196

From Figure 4, the results of the “knock-out” simulation showed that the number of cases in different

197

genders using parameters βm = 0, βf = 0, βmf = 0 and βfm = 0 were lower than in the control group. When βfm

198

= 0, the number of cases decreased most in different genders.

199

Figure 5 showed the difference between the mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) from 2005 to

200

2017 using βm, βf, βmf and βfm. The mean value when using βm was 1.9240  10-9 (95% CI: 1.6621  10-9 –

201

6.6121  10-9), using βf was 1.5645  10-9 (95% CI: 1.3521  10-9 – 1.7769  10-9), using βfm was 2.1572 

202

10-9 (95% CI: 1.9159  10-9 – 2.3986  10-9) and using βmf was 1.8750  10-9 (95% CI: 1.6846  10-9 –

203

2.0654  10-9).

The results of SAR from 2005 to 2017 were showed in Figure 6 and Figure 7. The median value of

205

SARmm was 2.3225  10-8 (Range: 1.7574  10-8 – 3.8565  10-8). The median value of SARmf was 2.5729 

209

The results of relative ratio of the dataset were depicted in Figure 8. The median value of relative ratio

210

calculated by SAR in mm vs mf was 0.93 (Range: 0.75 – 1.47). The median value of relative ratio in mm vs

211

fm was 0.90 (Range: 0.41 – 1.81), mm vs ff was 1.07 (Range: 0.55 – 2.93), mf vs fm was 0.99 (Range: 0.32

212

– 1.25), mf vs ff was 1.17 (Range: 0.43 – 3.21) and ff vs fm was 0.75 (Range: 0.35 – 1.06) (Figure 9).

Discussion
In this study, we were the first ones to make the transmission of shigellosis between different genders

216

clear. We applied SEIAR model to explore the differences of the water-borne infectious disease in males

217

and females for the first time. It has guiding significance for controlling the prevalence of shigellosis.

218

Validity of the model

219

According to R2 of linear regression, the model of SEIAR has a high good-of-fitness with the reported

220

data in different genders. It is consistent with the results of a research [6], suggesting the model is suitable

221

for this study.

222

Epidemiological characteristics

223

In recent years, although the incidence of shigellosis has a decreasing trend in China [16, 21, 22], it is

224

still relatively high level in Hubei province from 2005 to 2017. The difference incidence of shigellosis

225

cases in male and female is observed by the descriptive epidemiology [23, 24]. However, all of them do not

226

clarify the reasons for the difference. A study indicates that there were more male than female cases (the

227

ratio of male to female is 1.3:1), which is consistent with our results in descriptive epidemiology [25].

228

According to a new review[1], the transmission pattern of shigellosis has shifted from water/food-to-

229

person to from person-to-person, with high risk groups being particularly men who have sex with other

230

men in developed country. Does this mean that the transmissibility of shigellosis among males is stronger

231

than among females? We developed SEIAR model to verify this hypothesis. However, we obtained the

232

number of cases in five hypotheses using “knock-out” simulation. When βfm =0, the number of cases

233

dropped most in different genders, which means that the female-to-male had a large contribution during the

234

transmission. It is important to isolate and treat female cases, and to strengthen the personal health.

235

Transmissibility of Shigellosis in different genders

236

Compared with HIV which has different transmissibility in different genders, shigellosis is not

237

particularly highly contagious in different genders [26]. Our results showed that the mean values of the

238

transmission parameters among males and females, from male to female, and from female to male are

239

different, and they have the following order: βfm > βm > βmf > βf. The median values of SAR have the

240

following order: SARfm > SARmf > SARmm > SARff. The median values of relative ratio of SAR have the

241

following order: mf vs ff > mm vs ff > mf vs fm > mm vs mf > mm vs fm > ff vs mf. All the results have a

242

common feature, that the transmission is mainly female-to-male. These findings showed that male

243

individuals are more transmissible than female individuals. Therefore, the different transmissibility

244

between males and females is the reason for the difference in distribution between genders.

245

There are a large number of studies focused on the distribution of incidence in different age groups [1,

246

7, 16, 22]. And the high-risk group is under 5 years old and over 60 years old. Combining with our results

247

and the actual situation of China, whether it can be considered related to the tradition of the elderly

248

bringing children at home. Elderly people, especially grandmothers, have more daily contact with their

249

children, which lead to such high transmission rates. Meanwhile, the transmissibility of shigellosis in

250

different age groups further needs to be studied.

251

Limitation

252

According to a recent study, although it is mainly transmitted from person to person [1], the

253

shigellosis is still a water/food-borne disease. For this reason, there has been an impact on our result given

254

that we simplified the SIEARW model and ignored environmental factors (water and food). At the same

255

time, the parameters of SIEAR model come from relevant references and Hubei Statistical Yearbook, not

256

from collection, this has an impact on the accuracy of our model.

257

Conclusions

258

In Hubei Province, The incidence of shigellosis in males is higher than that in female, causing the

259

disease to be a burden. The transmissibility of shigellosis is different in male and female individuals. Males

260

seem to be more transmissible than females and the transmission is mainly female-to-male.
