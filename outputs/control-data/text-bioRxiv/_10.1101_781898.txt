Abstract
Functional features of populations of synapses are typically inferred from random electrophysiological
sampling of small subsets of synapses. Are these samples unbiased? Here, we developed a biophysically
constrained statistical framework for addressing this question and applied it to assess the performance of a
widely used method based on a failure-rate analysis to quantify the occurrence of silent (AMPARlacking) synapses. We thus simulated this method in silico and found that it is characterized by strong and
systematic biases, poor reliability and weak statistical power. Key limitations were validated by wholecell recordings from hippocampal neurons. To address these shortcomings, we employed our
experimentally constrained simulations to develop a synthetic likelihood estimator that infers silent
synapse fraction with no bias and low variance. Together, this generalizable implementation highlights
how computational models of experimental methodologies can substantially improve inference.

Significance statement
The plasticity potential of neural networks is influenced by the presence of silent (AMPA-lacking)
synapses. Silent synapses are more prevalent during early postnatal development, yet are found in adults
where drugs of abuse are thought to regulate their occurrence. Current methods estimate this global
fraction by recording from small subsets of electrically stimulated synapses. We show that a widely used
failure rate-based calculation returns highly variable, positively biased estimates of silent synapse
fraction. We developed an alternate estimator employing simulated likelihood functions which exhibits
dramatically decreased bias and variance. This method allows the reliable interrogation of fine-grained
changes in the functional make-up of synaptic populations, and exemplifies how computational models of
methodologies can be adapted into statistical inference tools.

Introduction
Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity has captured global research attention for well over four decades
due to its hypothesized role in learning and memory (1). Silent synapses contain only NMDA receptors,
not AMPA receptors, and represent preferential sites for receptor insertion during long-term potentiation
(LTP; 2, 3). Thus, their relative proportions in neural circuits is believed to be a fundamental determinant
of the plasticity potential of neural networks. Silent synapses are more prevalent in developing networks
(4, 5) yet continue to play a role in adult brain circuits for instance in newborn neurons (6), and mature
synapses can at times undergo ‘silencing’ by removal of AMPARs (7). Furthermore, addictive drugs such
as cocaine and morphine have been reported to induce de novo formation of silent synapse in rewardrelated pathways of adult animals (8-11). More generally, theoretical work has shown that high fractions
of ‘potential’ synapses (e.g. silent) are associated with optimal information storage over a range of
conditions (12-14). Together, whereas these observations point to the fundamental role of silent synapses
in both developing and mature brain circuits, they also emphasize the corollary challenge of quantifying
with precision their occurrence in synaptic populations with experimentally realistic throughput.
While sound methods exist to demonstrate the presence of individual silent synapses (Fig. 1Ai-ii) (2, 3),
these binary single-synapse classification methods can only estimate the fraction of silent synapses in a
population by pooling across repeated experimental attempts in a minimum stimulation paradigm (4, 5).
In contrast, multi-synapse classification methods, such as the failure-rate analysis (FRA) method, have
been developed to provide an estimate of the fraction of silent synapses for every attempt: here an
experimenter records from a small, but unknown, number of synapses simultaneously, and the FRA
formalism estimates the proportion of these which are silent by means of a comparison of failure rates
over many sweeps (Fig. 1Bi-ii) (methodology reviewed in 15). A number of studies have used this
method to quantify changes in silent synapse fraction, particularly in rodent models of drug addiction, but
also during critical periods of plasticity in the visual cortex and hippocampus (8-11; 16-21, 32). Yet,
although FRA seeks to scale up the throughput of silent synapse estimation, its scalability hinges on its
reliability and accuracy (especially compared with traditional binary classification methods), which have
not been investigated with targeted experiments and statistical analyses.
Here, we first employ a combination of biophysically constrained numerical simulations and
electrophysiological recordings to examine the performance of existing methods for silent synapse
detection and quantification. Our analysis reveals substantial and general limits on the reliability and
validity of the silent synapse fraction estimates obtained using the FRA formalism. To overcome these
inherent limitations, we build on approaches developed in the dynamical systems field and employed our
computational model to generate an approximate maximum-likelihood estimator, which provides
dramatic improvements in estimator bias and variance. A power analysis reveals that the enhanced
estimator can resolve fine-grained changes in silent fraction with experimentally feasible sample sizes.
Our estimator does not require a novel set of observations, and can thus be deployed on existing FRA
datasets. These tools and findings make large scale interrogation of changes in silent synapses possible
and reliable.

Results
While minimum stimulation experiments have been critically important for demonstrating the existence
of silent synapses, they do not formally allow estimation of the true silent synapse fraction (st) contained
in a synaptic population. A simple experimental technique, the failure rate analysis (FRA), has been
̂ A) of the true underlying silent fraction, st . In this
developed to provide a quantitative estimate (sFR
method, the rate of synaptic failures at two holding potentials (-60 mV and +40 mV) are used as inputs to
a mathematical equation (see Supplemental Methods for derivation), which returns an estimated fraction
of silent synapses. Despite this formalism, it is unclear how biophysical variables such as stochastic
neurotransmitter release and the inherent variability in the number of synapses stimulated shape the
statistical power and discriminability of this method. Here, we first use a set of increasingly constrained
and experimentally realistic numerical simulations and statistical tools to examine the performance and
general usefulness of this estimator.
A. Nonsilent synaptic populations and FRA estimator performance
As a first step, we directly determined the extent to which the stochasticity of synaptic release affect the
behavior of the FRA estimator for a typical electrophysiological recording. We thus numerically
simulated the simplest scenario where a single, non-silent synapse with probability of release Pr = 0.5 is
electrically stimulated (Fig. 1Ci). Henceforth we will refer to non-silent synapses as active synapses (i.e.,
synapses containing both AMPA and NMDARs). We simulated Bernoulli-distributed trials (failures and
successes) in 50-sweep epochs. The FRA technique, applied to a single, active synapse (i.e., st = 0)
̂ A ≈ 0. Fig. 1Cii depicts one example simulation where an estimate of sFR
̂ A ≈ 28.6 was
should return sFR
̂ A across multiple experiments (Fig. 1D) was strikingly broad (S.D. =
returned. The distribution of sFR
31.3%) and non-Gaussian, showing high kurtosis (Fisher’s kurtosis = 3.00) and a prominent left tail
(Fisher-Pearson coefficient of skewness = -1.01). These attributes therefore make the FRA estimator
̂ A
unsuitable for traditional parametric tests that assume normality. Furthermore, 45.3% of the sFR
distribution falls below zero, which are biologically irrelevant estimates. Since negative silent synapse
values are conspicuously absent from published datasets using FRA (8-11, 16-21), it is possible that these
negative values returned from the equation were arbitrarily set to a biologically relevant value of 0%
silent (i.e., systematically ‘zeroed’). This procedure would artificially inflate the mean silent synapse
estimate.
We next asked whether the FRA estimator's accuracy could be improved by simply increasing the number
of sweeps from the recommended value of 50 (15) (Fig. 1E). Increasing the number of sweeps per epoch
to 500 still produced a remarkably variable estimate (Fig. 1E inset; 500 sweeps: S.D. = 9.1%).
̂ A, due to the intuitive
Alternatively, recordings from multiple synapses may improve the reliability of sFR
averaging out of stochastic binary events. We thus numerically simulated FRA experiments on small
numbers of synapses, first analytically calculating a fixed Pr for all synapses such that the mean failure
̂ A
rate was 50% (as per standard experimental practice for this approach; Fig. 1F). Surprisingly, sFR
variability was virtually identical over the entire range of active synapse numbers (Fig. 1G, inset).
Therefore, in the simple case of non silent populations, the variability of the FRA estimates is not
markedly improved when monitoring multiple synapses.

̂ A estimates varied over a wide Pr
We considered the generalizability of our findings by asking how sFR
range and ensemble synapse number (Fig. S1 and Supplemental Information). Our analysis revealed that
the FRA estimator variance, surprisingly, is inversely proportional to synapse determinism (i.e., as
Pr → 0+ and as Pr → 1−), and does not significantly decrease with any combination of Pr and synapse
number. Taken together, these findings outline the inability of the FRA method to return reliable (i.e.,
low-variance) estimates of silent synapse fraction in simple conditions with no silent synapses present
(st = 0%), in most experimentally plausible conditions.
B. Silent synapse-containing synaptic populations and FRA estimator performance
Under conditions where silent synapses are present (st > 0%), the quantitative accuracy of the FRA
method is naturally dependent on the particular arrangement of synapses sampled. It is not intuitively
obvious whether traditional electrical stimulation selects an unbiased subsample of a larger synaptic
population, either in terms of silent fraction or of individual synapse properties such as release
probability. Therefore, before assessing the accuracy of the FRA equation, we first developed an
obligatory intermediate method to simulate experimentally feasible ‘draws’ of synapse sets, with varying
release probabilities, from larger mixed populations (Fig. 2A).
Briefly, we started with initial sets of 100 synapses with some true fraction silent (st). Release

probabilities were uniformly distributed (Pr ∼ U(0,1)). We next simulated as faithfully as possible a
typical FRA electrophysiological experiment. Thus, the initial set of activated synapses was subjected to
multiple rounds of stochastic synapse elimination (20% per round) corresponding to a decrease in
electrical stimulation intensity that an experimenter typically performs during an FRA experiment. The
rounds of elimination were ended when the failure rate of active synapses reached between 20% and 80%,
as dictated by described experimental guidelines (15). Synapse sets were discarded if they did not reach
this criteria before the elimination of active synapses. The simulation thus returned stochastic, small
subpopulations of silent and active synapses, each with an associated release probability, and with the
failure rate range as the main constraint.
To assess how the subpopulation sampling varied with st, we performed Monte Carlo simulations with 10
000 draws per condition. We found, surprisingly, that the number of active synapses in each
subpopulation reaching the selection criterion was very small - typically between 1 and 5 (Fig. 2Bi). As
one may intuit, large numbers of synapses in a draw are rare because they require very low Pr for every
synapse to achieve the desired failure rate (Fig. 2Bii). This experimentally-derived selection criterion
therefore leads to a bias towards sampling synapses with low Pr. The number of silent synapses in the
draws scaled with st , as expected (Fig. 2Ci). However, the sampled subsets were intriguingly enriched in
silent synapses compared to the ground-truth population (Fig. 2D). This bias arises from the fact that the
failure-rate criterion only depends on active synapse monitoring: therefore, the last elimination round
ineluctably eliminates an active, rather than a silent, synapse. The number of active synapses is therefore
under-represented in the sample, which leads to an overestimation of the silent fraction. Given that the
small size of the sampled synaptic population (1-5), this systematic bias is consequential. This appears to
be a general feature of the FRA method when stimulation amplitude is adjusted to reach a particular
failure rate.

We next considered the performance of the FRA estimator under this experimentally realistic scenario.
̂ A)
Individual simulations returned highly variable synapse sets (Fig. 2Ei) and inaccurate estimates (sFR
(Fig. 2Eii). Over multiple simulated experiments, the estimated silent synapse fraction showed distinctly
non-normal distributions (Fig. 2Eiii). We next undertook a formal analysis of the FRA estimator's bias
̂ A increased with the true silent fraction, st, and this occurred
and variance analysis. The bias of sFR
irrespective of whether negative estimates were erroneously set to zero (‘zeroing’) or not (Fig. 2Fi). The
standard deviation of the estimate was high across all silent fractions (Fig. 2Fii), reaching a maximum of
40% with zeroing applied. We conclude that the FRA estimator displays a high positive bias and large
variance, and thus is a flawed estimation technique.
While we drew the release probability of individual synapses from a uniform distribution following
previous work assessing Pr from iGluSnFR-mediated single-synapse release events (22), we additionally
asked whether different release probability distributions of a synaptic population would influence the
FRA estimator’s performance. First, we considered the gamma distribution (parameters: λ = 5.8; n = 3)
reported from staining-destaining experiments (Fig. 1G in ref. 23). This distribution produced negligible
changes in both the synapse selection bias, and in the bias and variance of the estimator (Fig. S3). We
additionally simulated the case with extremely small release probabilities (λ = 5.8, n = 1) (Fig. S4).
Although the mean number of active synapses rises from ~3 to ~10 (Fig. S4Bi), the estimator with
zeroing applied still shows comparable bias (27% bias at 50% silent, compared to 35% bias at 50% silent
for a uniform distribution) and variance (peak standard deviation of 30%) (Fig. S4Fi-ii). These results
demonstrate the significant propensity of the FRA estimator towards large positive biases and large
variances over a wide range of possible synaptic release probability distributions.
C. Electrophysiological verification of numerically simulated FRA estimate inaccuracies
We next experimentally assessed the propensity of the FRA approach to provide variable estimates of
silent synapse fraction by performing voltage-clamp recordings from CA1 neurons from p14-15 mice
while electrically stimulating Schaffer’s collateral synapses (Fig. 3A; see Methods). As per recommended
practice for typical FRA experiments, we tuned the stimulation intensity such that we obtained clear
monosynaptic currents with ~50% failure rates (Fig. 3B,C). We performed FRA experiments in triplicate
for each recording from individual CA1 neurons (Fig. 3D), and we verified that the evoked EPSC
amplitudes at both -70mV and +50mV were stable between these successive iterations (Fig. S5A),
confirming that we were stimulating the same subsets of synapses during each FRA iteration.

̂ A
Since we performed the FRA experiments in triplicate, our recordings returned three independent sFR
estimates of the same synaptic population. We found that these estimates were highly variable within the
same neuron, and often returned biologically irrelevant negative values (Fig. S5B), as predicted from our
simulations (Fig. 3E). Together, these results demonstrate that the estimated silent synapse fraction
returned by the FRA method on a fixed population naturally fluctuate in agreement with results from our
numerical simulations. This inherent lack of precision can be understood as resulting from stochastic
neurotransmitter release combined with the fundamental properties of the FRA estimator. Because we
cannot directly measure st, we are unable to formally compare the bias and variance of the estimator with
experimental ground truth, but these results nonetheless demonstrate the strong agreement between our
computational model and experimental findings in documenting the fundamental limits of the FRA
formalism.

D. An improved estimation technique based on synthetic likelihood functions
In principle, it should nonetheless be possible to extract reliable information about the true state of a
synaptic population from unreliable and biased estimates returned by the FRA method. For instance, if we
knew the distributions of failure rates at both hyperpolarized and depolarized potentials for each st, we
could write expressions for likelihood functions and construct a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE).
The logic of this approach is to first determine the analytical function establishing the probability of an
observation given some model parameters, and then to find the model parameter (here the silent synapse
fraction) that maximizes this likelihood function. This type of estimator is of particular interest here since
MLE minimizes the variance, at least asymptotically (37).
In the present case, however, the likelihood functions are analytically intractable, as they result from a
complex combination of the sampling protocol and the stochastic properties of synapses. Some
simplifying assumptions could be made to reach a closed-form likelihood function, but this would require
assuming that release probability distributions are independent of sampled synapse number, and that the
sampled subsets themselves reflect unbiased samples from the population (both assumptions are shown
by our model to be false). Alternatively, popular approaches for noisy dynamical systems sidestep
analytical solutions and rather construct synthetic likelihood functions from Monte Carlo simulations
(33-35). Here, the dynamical system is iteratively simulated and summary statistics are extracted,
allowing to likelihood-based estimation from a stochastic model. These likelihood function are
approximations only in the sense that they are based on a finite number of stochastic simulations, but will
converge to the true likelihood function. We use this formalism to construct an estimator, FRA-MLE,
from synthetic likelihood functions (Fig. S6A-B) where the summary statistic is the biased FRA estimate
̂ A ) (See Supplemental Methods for more details). Since our noisy sampling model already
itself (sFR
incorporates technical choices made by experimenters (e.g. the range of acceptable failure rates), this

(Fig. 2Fi), by yielding accurate estimates across the range of possible silent synapse values. Also in
contrast with the large variance found for the FRA estimator (Fig 2Fii), we found that although the
̂ A−MLE increases with ground truth silent fraction, it remains lower than that of sFR

As a final test, we applied FRA-MLE to the experimental values collected from hippocampus (Fig. S7).

We used FRA-MLE to arrive at a maximally likely estimate, sFR

likelihood estimate of 8.7% silent for our experiments (Fig. S7B). This was substantially lower than the
estimate obtained by simply taking the mean of all experimental FRA values (16.8%), in agreement with
our findings of a pervasive positive bias for FRA. We additionally verified our estimator and numerical
simulation approach as follows: We employed our statistical sampling model (i.e., successive rounds of
synapse elimination) to construct a hypothetical experimental distribution of FRA estimates for the
̂ A−MLE = 8.7 % obtained for our experiments. We found that this

model-generated distribution was not significantly different from the experimental distribution (Fig. S7C;
p = 0.90; KS-test, two-tailed). Together, these findings reiterate the general propensity of FRA to return
positively biased estimates, and demonstrate the ability of FRA-MLE to extract not just locally optimal
solutions, but solutions which are also in good quantitative correspondence with experimental
distributions.
E. A power analysis quantifies performance improvements of the FRA-MLE estimator
To achieve a high-throughput characterization, one needs to take two sets of n samples from either of two
separate conditions, and conclude with an experimentally realistic sample size whether the two conditions
do not have the same proportion of silent synapses (i.e. reject the null hypothesis). We used the
framework of power analyses to ask whether our FRA-MLE estimator compares favourably with other
methods (FRA or binary classification) in terms of the minimum sample size, nmin, required to
discriminate silent-containing populations from an active-only population. Depending on the estimator,
calculating nmin is done by either analytically or numerically calculating the minimum sample size to
achieve a threshold statistical power (i.e. a threshold false negative rate; see Supplemental Methods).
More specifically, since the FRA-MLE method calculates an approximate likelihood function explicitly,
we could use the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) to test against our null hypothesis (38), an approach that is
not possible with the FRA estimator. We can compare against the binary method (Fig. 1A) either using a
LLR as done for the FRA-MLE estimator or with a paired sample test as done with the FRA method.
Thus we compare four statistical protocols: FRA estimates using a paired test, FRA-MLE estimates using
LLR, binary classification using a paired test and binary classification using LLR.
Figure 4C shows nmin against the true silent synapse fraction. As is expected, we found that more samples
are required to discriminate smaller differences in silent synapse fractions from a fully active synapse
population. Importantly, we found a dramatic improvement in statistical power afforded by the FRA-MLE
technique (Fig. 4C) compared to FRA. While the FRA estimator required nmin = 36 to discriminate
populations containing less than 15% silent, FRA-MLE required only nmin = 8. Averaged across all silent
fractions, FRA-MLE achieved an identical statistical power to the FRA estimator with a 3.82-fold
reduction in sample size. Binary classification required 1.88-fold more samples than FRA, although when
LLR-based hypothesis testing was incorporated, the binary technique now required fewer samples than
FRA such that its power almost matched that of the FRA-MLE method. Together, this power analysis
shows that the FRA-MLE estimator renders more fine-grained silent fractions detectable with fewer
samples than comparable methods.

Discussion
It has been long understood that the plasticity potential of a network is in part determined by the fraction
of synapses which exist in a silent state, and the proportion of silent synapses is regulated both throughout
development (4-5) and in response to diseases or drugs (8-20). Despite a growing appreciation of the
overall importance of silent synapses in mature neural networks, a systematic analysis of quantification
methods for this parameter is, to our knowledge, lacking. Here, using statistical inference methods
alongside electrophysiological recordings, we have demonstrated the significant bias and variance
inherent to the popular failure-rate analysis method of silent synapse quantification. Through a set of

numerically simulated likelihood functions relying on minimal assumptions, we have furthermore
proposed and validated an alternate maximum-likelihood estimator which corrects for these flaws. This
approach illustrates the advantages of a model-based statistical inference approach.
Our computational model is based on two minimal constraints – first, that the range of failure rates for an
acceptable experiment is between 20% and 80%, and second, that release probabilities across a synaptic
population are drawn from a uniform distribution (22). It is formally possible that specific constellations
of central synapses in the brain may deviate from this assumption. For instance, a population dominated
by very low release probability synapses would inevitably result in the sampling of a greater number of
synapses, which could in principle increase the statistical power of the method and potentially decrease
bias. To address this possibility, we considered the release probabilities derived from staining-destaining
experiments in hippocampus that did not follow a uniform distribution (Fig. S3; ref. 23) and found that it
induced minimal changes in the mean estimates of sampled synapses. These considerations in effect
highlight a strength of the MLE model-based approach in that experimenters can ensure that the statistical
model is precisely calibrated to their experiment’s methodology (e.g., here, to a specified release
probability distribution).
We compared electrical minimum stimulation, historically considered the gold standard for silent synapse
detection (2-3) with the FRA method. We found that minimum stimulation required a greater sample size
(typically >2x larger) for the same degree of discriminability between populations. A sample size of 100
to discriminate between populations differing by 15% silent may appear restrictive, but methods such as
2P glutamate uncaging can provide a statistically equivalent alternative to electrical minimum stimulation
for a binary classification of synapses (i.e., active vs silent), while offering the potential for much faster
mapping (i.e., several synapses per neuron) with an additional spatial component. Analysis of the
electrophysiological responses induced by localized 2P glutamate uncaging can classify synapses as silent
(depolarized response) or active (hyperpolarized and depolarized response (24-25, 29-30). This approach
further circumvents the FRA assumption that synaptic release probability is invariant between
hyperpolarized and depolarized holding potential - a problematic assumption that is not always valid (e.g.,
depolarization-mediated suppression from excitation; ref. 41).
Recent work has drawn attention to the importance of silent synapses, suggesting their presence in mature
networks and outlining potential regulations by drugs of abuse. This renewed interest emphasizes the
need to consider the quantitative accuracy of current methods available to quantify silent synapses. We
have provided several lines of evidence that argue that the widely-used FRA technique, in its current
form, is a poor tool when fine discriminability is required. Our findings demonstrate an unsuspected
inherent high variability and positive bias obtained with this approach, and define constraints on the
granularity of the changes that can be expected to be detected with experimentally realistic sample sizes.
We have provided an enhanced FRA-MLE technique based on numerical simulations which provide
satisfactory correction to two inherent problems of the FRA formalism: high bias and variance. This
principled framework should allow for deeper investigation into subcellular and fine-grained differences
in silent synapse populations which may underlie network function and dysfunction in disease states. We
have further shown that the incorporation of a statistical model, as well as the use of a high-throughput
method such as two-photon uncaging, can render the class of single-synapse measurements highly
competitive with even the corrected FRA-MLE technique – with the additional strength of subcellular or
input-specific interrogation. An understanding of the dynamic network-level changes in silent synapse

fractions will ultimately aid in understanding how the plasticity potential of distributed networks of
neurons is established and modified.

Methods
A Python package which implements the optimal estimator, FRA-MLE, is available at https://github.com/
micllynn/SilentMLE.
Failure rate analysis equation and methodology
In FRA, experimenters measure synaptic failure rates during electrical stimulation while voltageclamping a neuron at hyperpolarized and depolarized membrane potentials. The resulting failure rates, Fĥ
(hyperpolarized) and Fd̂ (depolarized), are utilized as inputs to estimate the fraction silent synapses of
some recorded population:

̂ A=1−
sFR

ln Fĥ
⋅ 100 %
ln Fd̂

(1)

(2; See Supplemental Methods for full derivation and experimental procedures). The recommended
number of sweeps to produce each failure rate estimate is 50-100, and Fĥ should be kept around 0.5 (15).
Numerical simulations
All numerical simulations were performed using custom scripts employing standard functions of technical
computing libraries Numpy (39) and Scipy (40) in a Python 3.6 environment. See Supplemental Methods
for more details.
Electrophysiology
Hippocampal brain slices from P14-P15 mice (C57/Bl6) were made, and whole-cell recordings were
carried out from CA1 neurons using previously described methods while stimulating Shaffer collateral
afferents with a monopolar stimulating electrode. See Supplemental Methods for more details.

Supplemental Information
Derivation of FRA equation: Let ns represent the number of silent synapses in some ensemble, na

the number of active synapses, Fh the failure rate at hyperpolarized potentials (na synapses active) and Fd
the failure rate at depolarized potentials (na + ns synapses active since NMDA-receptor-containing silent
synapses can only conduct under depolarized settings). Then:

Fh = (1 − Pr)na → na = l og1−Pr (Fh )

Fd = (1 − Pr)na +ns → na + ns = l og1−Pr (Fd )
The silent fraction is s =

ns
,
n a + ns

so:

s=1−
s=1−

na
ns + na
log1−Pr (Fh )

log1−Pr (Fd )
log Fh
s=1−

Pr → 1− (Fig. S1A-B). However, at these two limits, the standard deviation of sFR
increases (Fig. S1C) – the estimates become less reliable at very high or very low release probabilities. It
is possible that there may be some combinations of synapse numbers and Pr exhibiting low estimate
variability. However, by simulating a large number of such combinations, we find that there is a lower
̂ A (Fig. S1D-Ei). In fact, although the variance of the
bound of ~25% on the standard deviation of sFR
estimator depends on both the Pr and the number of synapses, the variance of the estimator as a function
the failure rate is independent of the number of synapses (Fig. S1Eii). These counterintuitive behaviors
can be understood by appreciating the logarithm-transform taking place in the equation for the FRA
estimator (Fig. S2). First, under high-Pr conditions, as failure rates approach 0, the natural logarithm of
failure rates decreases nonlinearly, which amplifies failure rate variability under high-Pr conditions (Fig.
S2B, left). Second, under low-Pr conditions, as failure rates approach 1, the natural logarithm approaches
0 (Fig. S2B, left). Taking the fraction of two stochastic numbers approaching 0, as in the FRA equation,
amplifies the variability present. Therefore, due to the fundamental structure of the equation, the
variability of the FRA estimates is not markedly improved neither by sampling from more synapses nor
by sampling deterministic synapses.

Supplemental Methods
Simulations with active synapses only (Fig. 1, S1-S2). We simulated single active (nonsilent) synapses or
groups of active synapses. For each synapse i we assigned a release probability by drawing from a
uniform distribution Pri ∼ U(0,1).
We numerically stimulated stochastic neurotransmitter release at hyperpolarized voltages (Vh;
only active synapses) and depolarized voltages (Vd; active and silent synapses). 50 trials were simulated at
m
each of Vh and Vd . Trials were modelled as Bernoulli trials with failure rate F = ∏i=1 (1 − Pri ) over m
synapses considered, where m =

na
if V = Vh
. This yielded Fĥ and Fd̂ , which are estimates of
{na + ns if V = Vd

the true failure rate over 50 trials at Vh and Vd respectively. The FRA calculation was performed as
reported in equation (1) and Methods, with Fĥ and Fd̂ as the equation inputs. Simulated currents (for
purposes of illustration only) were generated by modeling the total current as a sum of all successfully
releasing synapses, where each success is treated as generating a stochastic unitary current with an
(arbitrary) mean amplitude of 10pA.
Simulations with active and silent synapses (Fig. 2, S3-S4). In this section, we describe our simulations of
minimum-simulation electrophysiological experiments, where a larger set of synapses with defined
release probabilities and some fraction silent are iteratively reduced into some experimentally feasible
subset on which to perform experiments. This iterative reduction models a gradual reduction in electrical
stimulation intensity that an electrophysiologist would perform.
Assume the true fraction of silent synapses in a population is st . For each replicate, an initial set

of silent and active synapse numbers {ns, na} were each chosen from a binomial distribution with an
initial population size of nt = 100 synapses and st silent probability (e.g. the distribution of ns silent
synapses was p(ns = k) = ( kt )stk (1 − st )n t −k ). Release probabilities for each synapse were I.I.D and
n

were drawn from either a uniform or gamma distribution as noted in the text, producing a vector of
release probabilities Pra = [Pr1, Pr2, . . . , Prna ] for active synapses and Prs = [Pr1, Pr2, . . . , Prns ] for

silent synapses. The synapse set {ns, na} and associated release probability set {Prs, Pra} were then
subjected to iterative rounds of reduction, which yielded an experimentally feasible subset.
Iterative reduction of the synapse sets proceeded until the failure rate criterion was met:
na
0.2 < F−70 < 0.8. Here, F−70 = ∏i=1
(1 − Pri ) where Pri ∈ Pra . F is analytically calculated at each
iteration, rather than estimated using Monte Carlo simulations, for purposes of computational efficiency.
Iterative reduction consisted of the following sequential steps: 1) Using pelim = 0.2 as the elimination

probability, stochastically eliminate pelim(ns + na ) synapses along with their associated release
probabilities in {Prs, Pra} . 2) After each elimination, calculate F−70 . 3). If F−70 falls within criterion
range, then store {ns, na} and {Prs, Pra}. If F−70 does not fall within criterion range, loop back to 1) and
repeat.
Together, this iterative decrease yielded Monte Carlo-simulated subsamples (replicates) of active
and silent synapses along with associated release probabilities {Prs, Pra} . For each replicate, we used
{Prs, Pra} to simulate 50 Bernoulli trials at each of Vm = − 70mV (na synapses) and Vm = + 40mV

Experimental measurement of silent synapse estimate variability in hippocampus (Fig. 3). Hippocampal
slices (300um thick) were made from P7-14 wild-type (C67/Blk) mice using a previously described
technique (36). In brief, mice were anesthetized using isofluorane, decapitated, and the brain was
extracted and placed in ice-cold choline-based cutting solution for the duration of the cut. Cutting solution
was comprised of 119 mM choline-Cl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 4.3 mM MgSO4-7H2O, 1 mM
NaH2PO4, 1.3 mM sodium L-ascorbate, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, and 11 mM glucose, and was equilibrated
with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. 300uM coronal sections were made of the hippocampus. Slices were
recovered in a chamber containing standard Ringer’s solution of the following composition: 119 mM
NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgSO4- 7H2O, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, and 11 mM
glucose, at a temperature of 37 °C, continuously bubbled with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Slices
were recovered for 1 h in the recovery chamber and equilibrated to a temperature of ∼25 °C until
recordings were performed.
Neurons were visualized in the CA1 subfield using an upright microscope (Examiner D1
equipped with differential interference contrast (DIC) (Zeiss; 40×/0.75 N.A. objective). Using 4-6mOhm
fire-polished glass electrodes (Sutter Corporation), CA1 subfield neurons were recorded in the whole-cell
patch-clamp configuration at room temperature (20-22C) with a cesium-based internal comprised of: [Get
cesium internal recipe and put here]. As an external solution, Ringer’s solution was continuously
circulated. Whole-cell recordings were carried out using an Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier, sampled at
10 kHz, digitized with an Axon Digidata 1440A (or 1550) digitizer, and filtered at 2 kHz. An electrical
stimulation electrode was placed apposed to the apical dendritic arbor to activate Schaffer collaterals.
Stimulation intensity was tuned such that ~50% synaptic failures and successes each were recorded.
The FRA protocol consisted of 100 sweeps of electrical stimulation (0.1ms pulse width; 10-15
seconds sweep-to-sweep time). 50 sweeps were performed at Vm = − 70mV and 50 sweeps were
performed at Vm = + 40mV. This FRA protocol was performed in triplicate on single neurons, with FRA
iterations immediately following one another. Recordings were discarded when the access resistance
changed by >30%. Liquid junction potential was not compensated for. The data was analyzed offline with
the aid of a custom Python module written by the author and available online at: https://github.com/
micllynn/synappy. Synaptic failures and successes were determined in an automated manner by setting a
threshold for the baseline-subtracted electrically evoked current to exceed to be considered a success. The
FRA calculation was performed as indicated in equation (1), by comparing the failure rate at -70mV and
+50mV. Mean estimate spread was calculated by subtracting the minimum FRA-estimated silent synapse
fraction from the maximum FRA-estimated silent synapse fraction within the same cell.
All experiments and procedures were performed in accordance with approved procedures and
guidelines set forth by the University of Ottawa Animal Care and Veterinary Services.

A maximum likelihood estimator derived from synthetic likelihood functions (Fig. 4, S6, S7). For a
jointly observed pair of failure rates at hyperpolarized and depolarized potentials, Fĥ and Fd̂ , we wish to
estimate the most likely st . If we had an analytically tractable likelihood function, we could use
likelihood-based inference techniques (e.g. maximum likelihood estimation) to find our most likely st .
However, two factors make it difficult to analytically derive a likelihood function: first, the number of
active and silent synapses in each sampled subset are only probabilistically related to st; and second, each
synapse has release probabilities Pr which are a complex function of the starting population’s Pr and a
bias imposed by the number of other (active) synapses present in that particular subset.
To circumvent these obstacles, we use a statistical inference approach inspired by recent
treatments of noisy dynamical systems (33). While each individual simulation of synaptic release trains
contains a large amount of information, we can extract summary statistics for each simulation and
construct a synthetic likelihood function yielding the probability of obtaining these summary statistics at
̂ A as the summary

When more than one piece of data is acquired, is convenient to write a joint log-likelihood
function over a given vector of observations D = (d1, d 2, . . . , dn ) . We can express this as
n
ℓ(st | D) = ∑i=1 log[ p(di | st )] . We can then construct an MLE estimator for st given some vector of

Power analysis of estimators for st (Fig. 4). We employed a power analysis approach to compare the
statistical power of different techniques for silent synapse detection. Parameters for power analyses were
α = 0.05 (false positive rate) and β = 0.2 (false negative rate) unless otherwise noted.
Given two populations of synapses, P1 and P2 , having distinct silent fractions st(1) and st(2) silent

fractions, respectively. We want to determine nmin , the minimum number of samples required to
discriminate these populations with some estimation technique. To do this, we wish to express statistical
power, p , as a function of the number of samples: p(n) . We can then find an nmin such that

p(n > nmin ) < β. Our approach to explore p(n) was to rely on Monte Carlo sampling methods paired
with an efficient binary search algorithm to search the space of possible n ∈ [0,211] (an arbitrary
maximum limit on n to search). Here, at each iteration, a sample size guess nguess is made. After Monte
Carlo simulations and an evaluation of statistical power (whether p(nguess ) < β or p(nguess ) > β). nguess is
adjusted up (if insufficient statistical power), or down (if sufficient statistical power). The amount that
nguess is adjusted by is halved at each time point in order to converge on the true value for nmin in
precisely t = 11 iterations (i.e. the algorithm has order O(l og2(n)) where n is the initial guess.)
The algorithm is described in the Python source code. Briefly:
0) Using the Monte Carlo methodology described above, generate numerical probability
distributions for estimates of st(1) and st(2). These distributions are denoted p(1)(s ̂FR A ) and p(2)(s ̂FR A ).
1) Set nguess = 211 = 2048 . Draw k = 10000 independent replicates, each composed of nguess

paired experimental samples sampled from p(1)(s ̂FR A ) and p(2)(s ̂FR A ) . This yields corresponding
replicate matrices D1 and D2, which have dimension (k , nguess ).

2) Evaluation of statistical power. For each one of the k columns in D1 and D2 , use a Wilcoxon
Rank-Sum statistical test and record whether the replicate is classified as a positive with p < α. Since the
populations have distinct silent fractions, all positives are true positives so we can record the number of
true positive n TP. Compute the false-negative rate as FNR = 1 − nTP /k.

4) Repeat until | nguess(t) − nguess(t − 1) | = 1. Then nmin = min{nguess(t), nguess(t − 1)}.

In Fig. 4C, we test each of the four estimators (fra, binary, fra-mle, binary(llr)) by testing the null
hypothesis that P1 is silent. So we fix st(1) = 0 while st(2) ∈ [0,1) and compute nmin(st(2)) for each
estimator:
̂ A (fra) the computation of nmin(st(2)) proceeds numerically as described in the algorithm above.
