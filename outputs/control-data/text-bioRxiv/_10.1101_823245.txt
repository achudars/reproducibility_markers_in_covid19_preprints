ABSTRACT

13

Small animal imaging has become essential in evaluating new cancer therapies as they

14

are translated from the preclinical to clinical domain. However, preclinical imaging faces

15

unique challenges that emphasize the gap between mouse and man. One example is the

16

difference in breathing patterns and breath-holding ability, which can dramatically affect

17

tumor burden assessment in lung tissue. As part of a co-clinical trial studying

18

immunotherapy and radiotherapy in sarcomas, we are using micro-CT of the lungs to

19

detect and measure metastases as a metric of disease progression. To effectively utilize

20

metastatic disease detection as a metric of progression, we have addressed the impact

21

of respiratory gating during micro-CT acquisition on improving lung tumor detection and

22

volume quantitation. Accuracy and precision of lung tumor measurements with and

23

without respiratory gating were studied by performing experiments with in vivo images,

24

simulations, and a pocket phantom. When performing test-retest studies in vivo, the

25

variance in volume calculations was 5.9% in gated images and 15.8% in non-gated

26

images, compared to 2.9% in post-mortem images. Sensitivity of detection was examined

27

in images with simulated tumors, demonstrating that reliable sensitivity (true positive rate

28

(TPR) ≥ 90%) was achievable down to 1.0 mm3 lesions with respiratory gating, but was

29

limited to ≥ 8.0 mm3 in non-gated images. Finally, a clinically-inspired “pocket phantom”

30

was used during in vivo mouse scanning to aid in refining and assessing the gating

31

protocols. Application of respiratory gating techniques reduced variance of repeated

32

volume measurements and significantly improved the accuracy of tumor volume

33

quantitation in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

38

Preclinical imaging has become an important tool for translating imaging techniques for

39

the detection and monitoring of cancer. A growing application of small animal imaging is

40

its utilization in supplementing a co-clinical trial (1, 2).

41

challenges in the design and interpretation of translational animal studies that must be

42

overcome to collect data which are meaningful in the context of clinical cancer research

43

(3). These include, but are not limited to, subject size, imaging hardware, motion, etc.

However, there are critical

44
45

We are developing quantitative imaging methods for use in the preclinical arm of a co-

46

clinical trial investigating synergy between immunotherapy and radiotherapy in sarcoma

47

(4). While magnetic resonance imaging is being employed to study primary lesion

48

characteristics in the limbs of both patients and mice, a critical metric of therapeutic

49

response in patients on study is metastasis-free survival determined through serial

50

imaging of the lungs, which is the most common site for metastasis for this type of soft

51

tissue sarcoma. To mimic the clinical study and patient standard of care, we are

52

performing periodic micro-computed tomography (CT) scans of mouse lungs to detect

53

and quantitate metastasis after treatment. Delineation of a significant trend in therapeutic

54

response requires accurate and precise volumetric measurements of lung tumors,

55

necessitating the implementation of respiratory gating techniques.

57

To understand the effect of respiratory gating on the sensitivity and precision of lesion

58

detection and measurement, we performed a series of in vivo scans on primary lung

59

tumor-bearing mice(5, 6). To better understand the effect of gating on true positive and

60

false negative rates, we also used simulated tumor images, both gated and non-gated,

61

which could be compared to a predetermined ground truth. Additionally, we evaluated

62

the utility of retrospectively gated images as an alternative to prospective gating with

63

reduced scan time. Finally, we have designed a clinically-inspired “pocket phantom” (i.e.,

64

a reference standard) for external use during scanning to aid in assessing gating

65

protocols (7). We performed a series of in vivo scans on tumor-bearing mice while varying

66

the animal’s position (test-retest), and performing the analyses in triplicate (repeated

67

measures) to assess the effects of gating on tumor detection and volumetric assessment.

METHODS

70

Animal Model

71

Lung tumors were generated by intranasal administration of adenovirus expressing Cre

72

recombinase (Adeno-Cre, Gene Transfer Vector Core, University of Iowa) into LSL-

73

KrasG12D; p53FL/FL mice as described previously (5, 6). Mice with primary lung tumors were

74

imaged at 12 weeks post Adeno-Cre infection, at which point multiple aggressive lung

75

adenocarcinomas (∼0.5–1.5 mm in diameter) were present within each mouse. All

76

animals were imaged at 24–30 weeks of age.

77
78

Micro-CT

79

All micro-CT imaging was performed using a micro-CT system developed in-house (8, 9).

80

Animals were scanned while breathing freely under anesthesia using 2–3% isoflurane

81

delivered by nose-cone. A pneumatic pillow was positioned on the animal’s thorax and

82

connected to a pressure transducer to monitor respiratory motion and inform gating. Body

83

temperature was maintained with heat lamps and a feedback controller. The x-ray source

84

parameters were 80 kVp and 40 mA with 10 ms exposures. A total of 360 views were

85

acquired over a full 360° rotation. The reconstruction resulted in a 63 µm isotropic voxel

86

size using the Feldkamp algorithm (9) followed by bilateral filtration to reduce noise (10).

87

The micro-CT images were converted to Hounsfield units (HU) and saved in DICOM

88

format. The radiation dose associated with a micro-CT scan was ~0.017 Gy per mouse,

89

which is ~294 to 411 times less than the LD50/30 lethal dose (5-7 Gy) in mice (11).

91

Phantom examinations for micro-CT

92

To assess image quality for our micro-CT scanner, we used a Micro-CT Phantom Kit that

93

is commercially available (pureimaging.com). This kit includes multiple phantoms: i) a

94

water phantom that is used for HU calibration as well as for measuring uniformity, noise

95

and the noise power spectrum (NPS) assessed using volumes of interest measuring

96

64x64x64 voxels around the periphery and at three different Z positions; ii) a calcium

97

hydroxyapatite (HA) phantom for bone density calibration that can also be used to verify

98

CT number linearity; iii) a phantom containing 25 µm tungsten wires designed to assess

99

the modulation transfer function (MTF) used for determining spatial resolution; iv) a multi-

100

layer phantom (also known as Defrise phantom) to assess the severity of cone beam

101

artifacts when using approximate reconstruction algorithms.

102
103

Prospective gating techniques

104

While clinical chest CT is performed during a single breath hold, projection data in micro-

105

CT must be acquired over many breaths. Resulting motion can lead to image blurring

106

which confounds measurement of small structures (such as developing metastases or

107

primary lung tumors), making respiratory gating necessary to achieve reasonable

108

accuracy. Respiratory gating can be performed prospectively or retrospectively (12). In

109

prospective respiratory gating, a single respiratory phase (e.g., end expiration) can serve

110

well to assess lung nodules. We were first to develop and implement combined cardiac

111

and respiratory gating for micro-CT (13), which improves cardio-pulmonary imaging

112

quality. However, the increased acquisition time which results from the addition of cardiac

113

gating makes combined gating unfeasible for the large number of animals and frequent

114

scan schedule required in the co-clinical trial. Consequently, we have used prospective

115

gating to synchronize acquisition with respiration only, in which each projection is

116

triggered when the respiratory signal breaches a user-defined threshold (Fig.1). Thus, all

117

projections are acquired in the same phase of the respiratory cycle (e.g., end inspiration),

118

which minimizes motion artifacts and blurring in the reconstructions (13).

Simulated tumor nodules

127

We have examined the effect of respiratory gating on lung tumor detection and volumetric

128

measurement using simulated nodules inserted into temporally-resolved micro-CT

129

datasets. A C57BL/6 mouse without lung tumors was scanned four times to acquire four

132

phase and processed with bilateral filtration (14). A lung mask was created for each

136

Three manual segmentations of real lung tumors were taken from previous micro-CT

137

image sets for incorporation into the reconstructions (Fig. 2). To augment this small bank

138

of tumors, they were subjected to transformations involving random rotations and skews

139

in three dimensions, resulting in tumors with a range of sizes (0.03 to 0.28 mm3).

140

Transforming the tumors altered their gray-values and textures. To address this, random

141

high frequency Gaussian noise and Gaussian filtering were applied to the tumor masks

142

to make the augmented tumors statistically like the originals.

143
144

Figure 2: Process of adding simulated tumor to respiratory-gated and non-gated CT

145

reconstructions. Deformation fields between respiratory phases are used to place tumors in

146

volumes corresponding to different respiratory phases. Once placed, each volume associated

147

with its lung phase is forward-projected in cone beam geometry. Random combinations of

148

respiratory-gated projections are used to simulate non-gated acquisitions. The projections from a

149

single lung phase create gated acquisitions.

150
151

The augmented tumors were randomly placed within the lung mask of the first respiratory

152

phase. The permitted locations were such that the tumor did not have more than 10%

153

overlap outside the lung-mask or with other tumors. In real data, lung tumors are often

154

along the edges of the lungs and near other tumors. To simulate this property, tumor

155

locations were weighted using the inverse of Euclidian distance to the nearest lung mask

156

boundary (i.e., positions nearest an edge of the mask will be selected with higher

157

frequency than those far from a mask boundary). To increase the likelihood of creating

158

groups of tumors, previously placed tumor locations were removed from the lung mask,

159

creating boundaries with high probability for additional tumors. Once all tumors were

160

placed in the volume, the image was forward-projected in cone beam geometry to

161

simulate CT sampling.

162
163

To simulate non-gated acquisitions, a deformation field was computed for the lungs for

164

each reconstructed respiratory phase using the demons algorithm (15, 16). The

165

deformation fields indicate how a tumor’s 3D position should change with respiratory

166

motion. The magnitudes of the computed deformation fields within the lung were small

167

due to difficulties for the algorithm to track low-contrast features in the lungs, however the

168

direction vectors were consistent with observed data. To correct this, we applied a

169

multiplicative factor to the deformation fields which provided a similar magnitude of motion

170

as in the respiratory-gated acquisitions. Tumor placement in each respiratory phase was

171

altered from the first respiratory phase by the modified deformation field. After tumor

172

placement, each respiratory phase image was forward-projected in the scanner cone

173

beam geometry. Non-gated reconstruction was simulated by randomly selecting

174

combinations of projections from each of the four respiratory phases. For gated

175

simulations, only the first respiratory phase was used for reconstruction, mimicking the

176

product of active breath gated acquisitions in vivo. Each image set contained gated and

177

non-gated reconstructions with twelve simulated tumors.

181

Retrospectively gated image generation and analysis

182

Images of five tumor-bearing mice were acquired with prospective respiratory gating

183

and without (non-gated). Respiration was monitored throughout the non-gated

184

acquisition, and the resulting projections were divisible into four breath phases.

185

Projections from a single respiratory phase (phase 0) were used as the retrospectively

186

gated CT images for tumor segmentation. Unfortunately, retrospective gating produces

187

an irregular angular distribution of projections per phase; thus, when using Feldkamp’s

188

reconstruction algorithm, streaking artifacts affect the image quality of the tomographic

189

reconstructions (17).

190
191

In a retrospective gating strategy, the projection images corresponding to a chosen

192

respiratory phase are also fewer in number. Thus, an iterative reconstruction is needed

193

to reduce the artifacts associated with missing angles. Reconstructions performed with

194

fewer projections generally appear noisier than well-sampled reconstructions. To

195

improve the reconstruction of retrospectively-gated data, we have used a sophisticated

196

iterative reconstruction algorithm based on the split Bregman method with the add-

197

residual-back strategy and with 4D bilateral filtration for regularization (18). In essence,

198

we solve the problem of temporal reconstruction (i.e., four different respiratory phases)

199

by minimizing the following penalized, weighted least squares objective function:
X=

arg min1
T
X 2∑𝑡[(AX𝑡 ‒ 𝐲) Q𝑡(AX𝑡 ‒ 𝐲)] + λ‖X‖BTV.

200
201

Each column of the reconstructed data, X, represents the reconstructed volume at a

202

different respiratory phase, indexed by t. The columns of X are related to the acquired

203

projection data, y, through the CT system projection matrix, A, and a time-point-specific,

204

diagonal weighting matrix, Qt. The weights on the diagonal of Qt are repeated for each

205

detector pixel within a single projection. The regularization term is controlled via the

206

regularization parameter λ. For retrospective gating, projection weights are assigned

207

based on Gaussian basis functions which are centered on the respiratory phase to be

208

reconstructed and which have a full-width-at-half-maximum equal to the integration time

209

of the projection data, scaled to span the complete respiratory cycle. The iterative

210

reconstruction was initialized with temporally-weighted least-squares evaluated for each

211

time point, t, (nt=4 respiratory phases) and with the biconjugate gradient stabilized convex

212

solver (BiCGSTAB (19)). For regularization we minimize bilateral total variation (BTV)

213

through the application of bilateral filtration (BF, (20)). The filtration domain is expanded

214

to include the respiratory phase point proceeding (t-1) and following (t+1) the time point

215

being filtered.

216
217

The signal-to-noise (SNR) was measured in the prospectively gated, retrospectively

218

gated, and non-gated images via regions of interest (ROIs) drawn in the liver and empty

219

space. Three tumors from each mouse were selected in the prospectively gated image,

220

varying the size and relative location as much as possible. Tumor isocenter coordinates

221

were recorded for consistent localization across segmentations. Measurements were

222

performed in triplicate in each image type, alternating between prospective, retrospective,

223

and non-gated. Sets within each triplicate were performed with at least one day in

224

between measurements, to avoid serial-segmentation biases in edge detection.

respiratory gating performance (Fig.3).

Mouse scans

249

For preliminary in vivo lung tumor studies, we scanned the same mouse in three adjusted

250

positions (repositioned on scan bed), acquiring images with and without gating in each

251

position. A non-gated scan requires about approximately 3 minutes and a prospectively

252

gated scan takes about 5 minutes to acquire. Post-mortem ex vivo scans of the same

253

mouse were also performed in triplicate and used as the standard for defining tumor

volumes and segmentation precision.

In order to understand the effect of precision on day-to-day tumor assessments for our

276

co-clinical trial, we have implemented a QIBA-inspired profile for mouse lung tumor

278

acquired. Lung nodules (n=13) were identified and measured in triplicate in each of the

281

3 conditions. Coefficients of variance (CV) were calculated for each measured tumor

282

volume in gated, non-gated, and post-mortem conditions. The tumors were then divided

283

into 3 groups based on size (as measured post-mortem). Within-subject coefficients of

284

variance (wCV) were determined for each size group in gated and non-gated images (24),

285

and used to calculate the 95% confidence intervals (CI) as follows:

286
287

After scanning, the animals were sacrificed and post-mortem images were

95% 𝐶𝐼 = 𝑌 ± (1.96 ∗ 𝑌 ∗ 𝑤𝐶𝑉)
where Y is the measured tumor volume, and wCV is dependent upon the size of Y.

288
289

To assess the utility of the calculated 95% CIs, an independent group of tumor-bearing

290

animals were scanned with and without respiratory gating. Three tumors of varying sizes

291

were identified in each mouse (n=15), and volume measurements were repeated three

292

times for each tumor/condition. The results were plotted against the calculated 95% CIs

293

to determine if the size-dependent prediction of precision reasonably reflected variance

of repeated measures across a range of tumor sizes.

Statistical analysis

297

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculations were performed to examine the effect of gating

on volume reproducibility. Bland-Altman analyses were used when comparing acquisition

defined as: *p<0.05.

RESULTS

Technical performance of the micro-CT scanner was assessed with phantom scans (Fig.

higher resolution. However, these noise levels are acceptable when imaging a high

noise. The noise power decreases significantly at high spatial frequencies (Fig. 4 D). We

Respiratory gating reduces variance and improves accuracy of tumor volume

325

measurements in vivo

326

To quantify the impact of respiratory gating on tumor volume measurements, selected

327

lung lesions in mice with primary tumors were segmented in triplicate from images

328

acquired with gating, without gating, and after sacrifice (motion-free control). Tumors of

329

varying size which were locatable in all three acquisition conditions were selected for

330

analysis (Fig. 5). The mean volume calculated in non-gated images was significantly

331

different (*p<0.05, calculated via ANOVA) from the post-mortem values in 2 out of 4

332

tumors (Fig. 5 B-C). Gated volumes did not differ significantly, suggesting that gating

333

improves accuracy of volume measurements compared to non-gated images. In all

334

cases, the mean volume calculated from the non-gated image was greater than both the

335

post-mortem and gated images. On average, the variance in volume calculations was

336

2.9% in post-mortem images, 5.9% in gated images, and 15.8% in non-gated images

337

(Fig. 5 D). Thus, prospective gating reduces variance compared to non-gated images in

338

repeated measures, demonstrating improved volume measurement precision. Gating did

339

not result in higher variance or lower accuracy than non-gated images when calculating

340

tumor volumes in any case. Taken together, these data suggest that in free-breathing

341

mice, prospective gating reduces motion-based blurring and improves tumor volumetry

342

precision and accuracy.

343
344

Fig. 5. Respiratory gating improved the accuracy and precision of tumor volume

345

measurements in the lung. Volumes were calculated for a collection of tumors (A) in 3 positions

346

per condition, including a non-gated image, a gated-image, and an image acquired post-mortem

347

(standard). When accounting for variance, volumes from non-gated images were significantly

348

different from post-mortem standards in half of cases, while gated image volumes did not differ

349

significantly (B; *P<0.05, ANOVA). The resulting ANOVA table describes the deviation and

350

difference in means between acquisition condition per tumor (C). Coefficients of variation were

calculated for each condition and averaged for each acquisition type (D).

353

From data acquired in animals scanned before and after sacrifice, we constructed a

354

QIBA-inspired profile for lung tumor segmentation in CT images acquired with and without

355

gating on our scanner. Given the dependency of segmentation precision or accuracy on

356

nodule size, the predicted confidence intervals were calculated for ranges of tumor

357

volumes observed on study. As expected, wCV and confidence intervals were generally

358

reduced for volume assessments in gated images compared to non-gated images (Fig. 6

359

A). This disparity increased with rising nodule volume, where the precision of gated

360

volumetry improved while non-gated precision remained unchanged. To assess the utility

361

of the derived confidence intervals for gated and non-gated volumetry, we performed test-

362

retest triplicate segmentations of multiple tumors in five mice. In gated and non-gated

363

images, the calculated 95% confidence intervals were successful in predicting variance

364

of volume measurements based on tumor size, with only one notable exception in a non-

365

gated segmentation of a large tumor (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the derived 95% confidence

366

intervals provide a reasonable metric for estimating the probable variance in tumor

367

volume measurements acquired with our lung CT protocols. This is of immense value in

368

a large-scale, co-clinical trial setting, where high animal numbers make persistent

369

measures of precision infeasible. In addition, the need for longitudinal assessments

370

requires a means of understanding the differences in precision as a tumor changes size,

371

without the validation of post-mortem ground truth.

Simulated lung nodules clarify the sensitivity and specificity of tumor detection in

382

micro-CT of mouse lungs with and without respiratory gating.

383

To assess false negative rates and limits of detection, we utilized our lung micro-CT

384

datasets containing simulated tumors which can be compared to a binary label map, or

385

absolute truth (Fig. 7). Simulated tumor volumes were measured in triplicate on the

386

original binary label map (to quantitate any variance due to segmentation drawing), the

387

non-gated images, and the gated images (Fig. 8 A). Precision of repeated volume

388

measurements was frequently superior in the gated acquisitions compared to the non-

389

gated measurements. Additionally, the accuracy of tumor volume calculations in gated

390

images was consistently better than in non-gated images, with multiple non-gated volume

391

calculations deviating significantly from the binary label map (truth).

Bland-Altman analysis comparing volume measurements from binary label maps with

416

those derived from gated and non-gated acquisitions suggested that both acquisition

types resulted in volume measurements of reasonable agreement with the ground truth

(Fig. 8 B). However, the trend seen in the plot of non-gated acquisitions, demonstrated

419

by a linear negative slope, suggests that volume calculations from these images are

420

subject to a tumor size-dependent bias. Specifically in non-gated images, large simulated

tumors and small simulated tumors were frequently over- and under-estimated,

respectively.

428

(Fig. 8 C). Similarly, the positive predictive value (PPV; precision) of gated images was

429

1.0, compared to 0.71 in non-gated images. When comparing limits of detection of TPR

430

= 0.9 (the size of lesion at which TPR drops below 0.9), gating maintained reliable

431

detection down to tumor volumes of approximately 1.0 mm3, while non-gated images

432

were not reliable in positive prediction at volumes below approximately 8.0 mm3 (Fig. 8

433

Retrospective gating techniques improve volume measurement accuracy

compared to non-gated images

437

Datasets including prospectively gated and non-gated images were acquired in five mice.

438

Retrospective images were generated from the non-gated images by selecting

439

projections from a single phase of respiration. First, signal-to-noise (SNR) measurements

440

were taken by selecting ROIs in the liver and empty air surrounding the mouse (Fig. 9 A).

441

Prospectively gated and non-gated images demonstrated similar SNRs, with prospective

442

gating being slightly better. Retrospectively gated images showed SNR of approximately

443

half of prospectively gated images (Fig. 9 B).

444

retrospectively gated images although reconstructed using an iterative approach use

mostly one fourth of the data, resulting in more noise. Nevertheless, we note that iterative

reconstruction does help compared to filtered back projection for the same amount of

data.

450

comparisons, there were four tumors in which the non-gated image resulted in

451

significantly different volume measurements compared to prospectively gated images

452

(Fig. 9 C). Retrospectively gated images differed significantly from prospective gating in

453

the case of two tumor volume measurements, one of which was also mis-measured in

454

non-gated images. Bland-Altman comparison of both alternatives to prospective gating

455

demonstrated that retrospective gating resulted in better agreement, with a smaller bias

456

and reduced limits of agreement (Fig. 9 D-E). Overall, retrospective gating improved

457

volume accuracy relative to non-gated images, but was not a perfect substitution for

458

prospective gating. This is likely due to the variance in measurements caused by a lower

459

SNR. Taken together, these data suggest that retrospective gating helps alleviate some,

460

but not all, of the motion-related issues with tumor volumetry with a shorter acquisition

461

time than prospectively gated lung CT.

of the following conditions: no gating, respiratory gating, post-mortem (motion-free) (Fig.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

490

The goal of this work was to assess the performance and utility of respiratory-gated CT

491

for detection and measurement of tumors in mouse lungs to serve a co-clinical imaging

492

study. When compared to clinical CT, the first challenge in implementing preclinical

493

imaging is ensuring adequate and comparable instrumentation. The performance of the

494

micro-CT scanner was found to be adequate for imaging of small tumor nodules in the

495

lungs of mice. We note that there are important constraints on radiation dose levels which

23

496

are intentionally very low to minimize any influence of longitudinal scanning on the

497

outcome of the experiments.

498

Unlike clinical chest CT, in which patients may hold their breath to reduce motion during

499

acquisition, breathing motion in micro-CT of mouse lungs is a persistent barrier to small

500

lesion detection. The development of lung metastases is a critical metric for assessing

501

therapeutic response in our co-clinical trial of sarcoma, making the ability to discern

502

differences in small lesions between treatment arms paramount. Thus, we employed

503

respiratory gating techniques to lessen the effect of motion in the lungs, increase visibility

504

of small lesions, and improve tumor volume measurement. In vivo studies demonstrated

505

that tumor segmentations performed in images with prospective respiratory gating more

506

accurately measured the volume of tumors than non-gated segmentations, compared to

507

post-mortem controls. In multiple instances, non-gated tumor volumes were significantly

508

different than control measurements, while gated volumes never differed significantly.

509

Further, gated segmentations were consistently more precise than those measured in

510

non-gated images. These data support the use of prospective respiratory gating to

511

improve tumor analysis in the lungs of free-breathing mice.

512

While post-mortem tumor measurement can serve as a motion-free control, the

513

volumetric limits of detection with or without gating remain undefined. Specifically, post-

514

mortem controls do not provide a complete assessment of false negative and false

515

positive rates, even though motion is not present. To delineate false negative rates, and

516

how gating techniques affect them, we utilized images which contained simulated tumors

517

that visually mimicked real tumors, projected into healthy, free-breathing micro-CT

518

images of the mouse lung. Most importantly, the size, shape, and location of simulated

519

tumors which appear in the final projections are known, providing a definitive ground truth

520

to which analyses can be compared. Using this system, we were able to interrogate the

521

sensitivity and precision of tumor detection in our micro-CT images, as well as quantitate

522

the advantage of respiratory gating techniques with respect to lesion size.

523

respiratory gating improved overall sensitivity and specificity of tumor detection compared

524

to non-gated projections.

525

consistently better in gated images, while non-gated images demonstrated size-

526

dependent discrepancies in volumetric accuracy.

527

While prospective respiratory gating significantly improved tumor detection and

528

measurement accuracy/precision, there is a time cost for acquiring prospectively-gated

529

images. Thus, we evaluated retrospective gating of non-gated images as an alternative

530

to prospective gating. Conceptually, retrospective gating would reduce motion-related

531

artifacts and blurring, improving lesion detection/measurement with the same short

532

acquisition time of a non-gated image. We found that, indeed, retrospective gating did

533

improve accuracy of tumor volumetry compared to non-gated images.

534

retrospectively-gated images were consistently noisier, resulting in less precise

535

measurements than both non-gated and prospectively-gated images. Thus, the utility of

536

retrospective gating for tumor volume measurement lies somewhere between

537

acquisitions without gating and prospectively gating. It is also worth noting that while

538

some time is saved during acquisition compared to prospective gating, long

539

reconstruction times (> 30 mins) associated with iterative reconstruction algorithms must

540

be considered. Still, retrospective gating could serve as a reasonable alternative to

541

prospective gating for those hoping to improve non-gated lung imaging without sacrificing

In fact,

Further, accuracy of tumor volume measurement was

542

scan time. We note that with more sophisticated reconstruction iterative algorithms, the

543

performance of the retrospectively gated images can be improved (25).

544

Finally, given the impact of successful gating on image quality, we sought to create and

545

implement a “pocket phantom” with which we could assess gating success on a scan-to-

546

scan basis. We measured beads contained within the pocket phantom, which moved

547

with the mouse as it breathed, with the same methods used to measure tumors. As was

548

seen with lung lesions, gating improved precision when repeatedly measuring the volume

549

of multiple pellets. The use of these pocket phantoms represents a simple and elegant

550

technique by which users can monitor gating success in vivo.

551

phantoms may be used as internal controls to identify instances of inadequate gating,

552

such as in the case of weak or inconsistent respiratory signal.

553

Overall, we have demonstrated methods for respiratory gating for improving tumor

554

detection and measurement accuracy in the lungs of free-breathing mice. Further, we

555

have provided rigorous assessment of preclinical gating techniques, highlighting the

556

advantages and shortcomings of multiple methods for correcting lung motion in the

557

context of a co-clinical cancer imaging study.
