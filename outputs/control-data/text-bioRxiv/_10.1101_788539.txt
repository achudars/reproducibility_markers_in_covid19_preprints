Abstract

4

Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in cell death, demyelination, and axonal loss. The spinal cord has a

5

limited ability to regenerate and current clinical therapies for SCI are not effective in helping promote

6

neurologic recovery. We have developed a novel scaffold biomaterial that is fabricated from the

7

biodegradable hydrogel oligo[poly(ethylene glycol)fumarate] (OPF). We have previously shown that

8

positively charged OPF scaffolds (OPF+) in an open spaced, multichannel design can be loaded with

9

Schwann cells to support axonal generation and functional recovery following SCI. We have now

10

developed a hybrid OPF+ biomaterial that increases the surface area available for cell attachment and that

11

contains an aligned microarchitecture and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to better support axonal

12

regeneration. OPF+ was fabricated as 0.08 mm thick sheets containing 100 Î¼m high polymer ridges that

13

self-assembles into a spiral shape when hydrated. Laminin, fibronectin, or collagen I coating promoted

14

neuron attachment and axonal outgrowth on the scaffold surface. In addition, the ridges aligned axons in

15

a longitudinal bipolar orientation. Decreasing the space between the ridges increased the number of cells

16

and neurites aligned in the direction of the ridge. Schwann cells seeded on laminin coated OPF+ sheets

17

aligned along the ridges over a 6-day period and could myelinate dorsal root ganglion neurons over 4

18

weeks. The OPF+ sheets support axonal regeneration when implanted into the transected spinal cord.

19

This novel scaffold design, with closer spaced ridges and Schwann cells is a novel biomaterial construct

20

to promote regeneration after SCI.

1. Introduction

3

The spinal cord has a limited ability to regenerate after spinal cord injury (SCI) and available therapies are

4

not efficacious in promoting recovery of motor and sensory neurological function. The failure to recover

5

function may be due to secondary events that occur after the primary insult such as cell death, axonal loss,

6

demyelination, cyst formation and an increase in the inhibitory microenvironment [1]. Many therapies are

7

currently under investigation for treating one or more of these secondary events using neuroprotective

8

strategies and cell, regenerative, and rehabilitative therapies [1, 2]. A single therapeutic strategy is

9

unlikely to be effective in treating a disorder that is heterogeneous in its underlying pathophysiology.

10

Combinatorial treatments that simultaneously address multiple contributions to the residual of the injury

11

will be required.

12

Biomaterial scaffolds are an attractive platform for combinatorial therapies because they are able to bridge

13

the physical gap produced from gliosis, cyst formation, and cell death by providing structural support for

14

regenerating cells [3, 4]. Biomaterials can be combined with extracellular matrices, cells, or

15

pharmaceuticals to promote a more hospitable environment for regeneration [3, 5, 6]. We have developed

16

a positively charged polymer, oligo[poly(ethylene glycol)fumarate] (OPF+) for scaffold fabrication in a

17

multichannel design that overlays the different tracts of the spinal cord [4, 7]. OPF+ forms a porous,

18

biodegradable hydrogel that is mechanically similar to the spinal cord [8]. The positive charge on OPF

19

enhanced neuronal cell attachment, extension and the axonal myelination with Schwann cells in vitro [9].

20

In vivo, OPF+ loaded with Matrigel supported axonal regeneration over 4 weeks [10]. OPF+ scaffolds

21

loaded with Schwann cells further improved axonal regeneration, and growth orientation over that seen

22

with Matrigel alone, and reduced collagen scarring, cyst formation, and proteoglycan accumulation

23

following transection injury [4, 7, 10]. Schwann cells, that were genetically modified to express high

24

concentrations of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF-SC), increased axonal regeneration and

1

myelination compared to wild type Schwann cells and led to enhanced functional recovery following

2

spinal cord transection [5].

3

Axonal regeneration occurred through the open channels in the scaffold, as well as on the outer surface of

4

the scaffolds. This observation led to the new hypothesis that changing the scaffold architecture to

5

increase the surface area available for axons to regenerate may increase the number of axons regenerating

6

through the scaffold and provide directional guidance. Different scaffold designs have been fabricated

7

with a higher proportion of open to closed spaces in association with a novel ridged surface architecture

8

that would guide regenerating axons. Physical structures for contact mediated axonal guidance, such as

9

microgrooves or ridges, have been created by laser etching onto polymer surfaces [11-13]. Initial studies

10

using quartz slides microgrooves improved the directional orientation of seeded fibroblast and epithelial

11

cells but did not align chick embryo neurons [11]. Yao et al. (2009) subsequently demonstrated that

12

micro-patterned poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) sheets increased neurite alignment. In another study,

13

neonatal rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were cultured on grooved polymers of poly(dimethyl

14

siloxane) coated with poly-L-lysine and laminin. On this surface neurites extended along and arched

15

over the grooves with the somas preferentially adhering to the ridges [14].

16

The addition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins onto polymer surfaces provides sites for receptor-

17

mediated cell attachment to promote axonal guidance and cell migration [15]. Grooved polymers coated

18

with gradients of laminin or collagen have been shown to direct axonal growth cones [16, 17].

19

Fibronectin promotes Schwann cell proliferation and motility in culture [18], and is an attractive ECM

20

candidate to make biomaterials more cell adhesive and facilitate growth. Peripheral nerve regeneration in

21

rats can be enhanced by the addition of fibronectin and Schwann cells in alginate hydrogels [19].

22

Fibronectin has also been shown to help increase serotonergic axon sprouting and can influence axonal

23

growth when used in combination with cells, growth factors, and biomaterials [20, 21].

1

In this study we sought to determine which ECM molecules best support neuronal attachment, and

2

whether the structural microarchitecture may further improve the directional alignment of axonal

3

extension and myelination in vitro. A novel hybrid OPF+ scaffold design was fabricated as a ridged, flat

4

sheet and coated with ECM proteins. Upon hydration the sheets had the unique property of spontaneously

5

rolling into a spiral 3D configuration. Polymer sheets with ridge spacings of 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, or 1 mm

6

apart were coated with laminin, collagen, or fibronectin, and used in in vitro assays to quantitate neuronal

7

attachment, DRG neurite extension, and axonal myelination by Schwann cells. A proof of concept study

8

was then conducted in vivo to compare axonal regeneration in laminin and untreated spiral scaffolds

9

implanted following complete spinal cord transection.

2. Material and Methods

11

2.1 OPF Synthesis and OPF+ Scaffold Fabrication

12

OPF+ was synthesized as described previously [8, 9]. To create the ridged OPF+ sheet, liquid polymer

13

was pipetted onto a Teflon mold that contained micro-grooves 100 Âµm in depth and spaced 1 mm, 0.4 mm

14

and 0.2 mm apart. A glass slide was place on top with a 0.08 mm thick spacer. The sheets were

15

polymerized by exposure to an ultra-violet (UV) light (365nm) for one hour and cured overnight. Single

16

channel OPF+ scaffolds were fabricated by mold injection of the polymer, and cast over a 1mm wire prior

17

to UV exposure. The scaffolds were cut into 2mm lengths for transplantation.

18

2.3 Swelling Ratio

19

Desiccated, ridged OPF+ sheets were cut into 6x6 mm pieces and weighed dry (Wd) and following

20

hydration in distilled water for 24 hours (Ws; swollen weight).

21

The swelling ratio was calculated using the equation:

1

OPF+ sheets were sterilized by immersion in serial dilution of ethanol, rehydrated in cell culture media

2

and then pinned flat onto sterile culture dishes containing a layer of silicone elastomer (SYLGARDÂ® 184

3

Silicone Elastomer Kit; Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA). The OPF+ sheets containing ridges spaced 1

4

mm apart were coated with rat tail collagen 1 (3.36 mg/ml; CorningÂ®, New York, USA), laminin (100

5

Î¼g/ml; Sigma-AldrichÂ®, St. Louis, MO, USA), or rat plasma fibronectin (10 Î¼g/ml) overnight at 37Â°C.

6

Control sheets received no additional ECM protein coating other than that which would be present in the

7

serum of the media (referred to as serum coated). The fibronectin was purified by gelatin-Sepharose

8

affinity chromatography from frozen rat plasma [6]. The sheets were then washed 3 times to remove

9

unabsorbed ECM proteins. To determine the effect of dissociated DRG attachement and alignment on

10

OPF+ sheets with different ridge sizes, OPF+ sheets with ridges 0.2 mm, 0.4mm, and 1mm apart were

11

coated with laminin.

12

2.5 Whole DRG Explants

13

DRG neurons were isolated from Sprague Dawley pups on embryonic day 15 as previously described

14

[22]. Whole DRG were placed on the scaffold in media containing modified Eagleâs medium (MEM;

15

Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum (CBS) (HyClone, Logan,

16

Utah, USA), L-glutamine (1.2 mM; Gibco), glucose (7mg/ml; Sigma Aldrich) and nerve growth factor

17

(NGF, 5ng/ml; Harlan Bioproducts, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Initially, the explants were incubated for 1

18

hour at 37Â°C in 150 Î¼L media to allow them time to attach. Once the DRG explants were attached the

19

plate was filled with media.

20

Eighteen DRGs for each condition were plated with 4-6 DRGs per scaffold. DRG explants were imaged

21

at 24 and 48 hours after isolation using a Zeiss Axiovert Model 35 microscope with a Nikon CCD camera.

22

Length of the longest neurite of each DRG was analyzed by measuring from the edge of the DRG to the

23

end of the longest outgrowing neurite using Image J (NIH). Given a variable degree of DRG attachment

1

on each type of substrate, the final numbers of explants available for analysis was n=17 DRGs for

2

laminin, n=11 DRGs for collagen, n=11 DRGs for fibronectin, and n=4 DRGs for serum coated.

3

2.6 DRG Neuronal Cultures

4

Dissociated DRG neurons were isolated from Sprague Dawley pups on embryonic day 15 as previously

5

described [22]. Approximately 100-200 whole DRGs were pooled and dissociated using trypsin and

6

mechanical trituration. 50,000 cells were plated onto each scaffold sheet, and were grown in MEM

7

supplemented with 15% CBS (HyClone, Logan, Utah, USA), L-glutamine (1.2 mM; Gibco), glucose (7

8

mg/ml; Sigma Aldrich) and NGF (5ng/ml; Harlan Bioproducts, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Dissociated

9

cultures were treated for 3 days with 1 x 10-5 M 5-fluoro-2-deoxy-uridine and with 1 x 10-5 M uridine

10

(Sigma) to remove non-neuronal cells[23, 24]. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30

11

minutes and stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4Â°C for immunocytochemistry.

12

2.7 Immunocytochemistry

13

The fixed OPF+ sheets were blocked with 10% normal donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.01M

14

PBS for 30 minutes. Primary antibodies against mouse anti-Î²-III tubulin (1:300, Millipore) and rabbit

15

anti-myelin basic protein (1:800, Abcam) were diluted in PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum and

16

0.3% Triton X-100 at 4Â°C overnight. Secondary antibodies (donkey anti- mouse Cy3; Millpore; 1:200

17

and donkey anti- rabbit Alexa 647; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1:200) were diluted with 5%

18

normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton-X-100 in PBS. After removing the pins, the OPF+ sheets were

19

carefully placed onto a glass slide using forceps with the ridges facing upwards. Glass coverslips were

20

mounted using Slow Fade Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI nuclear stain (Molecular ProbesÂ©, Eugene,

21

Oregon, USA).

22

2.8 Image Analysis of DRG Neurons

23

All images of dissociated neurons were taken using an inverted fluorescence microscope Zeiss Axio

24

Observer Z-1 with a motorized stage (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Oberkochen, Germany) mounted with an Axiocam

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/788539; this version posted October 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

1

503 camera (Zeiss). Pictures were acquired via the ZEN 2 (blue edition) imaging software (Carl Zeiss).

2

For cell quantification, z-stacks with approximately 5 slices at magnification of 10x were taken using an

3

EC Plan-Neofluar 10x/0.30 Ph1 objective. On each polymer sheet, 4 representative areas of different

4

ridges and the adjacent flat parts were systematically captured. To avoid bias, the regions were chosen by

5

moving one field of view up or down form the centered position and then 2 fields across left or right to

6

yield a total of 4 quadrants. The DRG neurons preparation was repeated at least 3 times. Cell nuclei

7

(DAPI), which were associated with axons (Î²-tubulin, red) were counted in each image in an area of

8

878.94 Âµm x 662.84 Âµm on the polymer to quantify neuronal cell attachment.

9

In order to determine the ECM protein-coating that displayed most neurite outgrowth and attachment, the

10

amount of Î²-III tubulin was calculated for each polymer sheet using ImageJ software by measuring the

11

mean gray value of the staining. The amount of Î²- tubulin staining was normalized to the amount of

12

DAPI (mean grey value) per cell. A mean value of normalized Î²- tubulin mean gray values was derived

13

for each polymer sheet from replicates of the 4 fields of views. For comparison between different ECM

14

molecules on OPF+ sheets with 1 mm spaced ridges, laminin coated sheets had n=7 sheets, fibronectin

15

coated sheets had n=3 sheets, collagen coated sheets had n=4 sheet, and sheets with no substrate had n=6

16

sheets. For different spaced ridges, OPF+ sheets with 0.2 mm spaced ridges had n=3 sheets, 0.4 mm

17

spaced ridged sheets had n=2 sheets, and 1 mm ridged sheets had n=4 sheets.

18

2.9 Schwann Cell Cultures

19

Primary rat Schwann cells were isolated from sciatic nerves of 2-5 day old Sprague Dawley pups as

20

previously described [25, 26]. 125,000 cells were seeded on to laminin coated OPF+ ridged sheets.

21

Schwann cells were imaged using Zeiss Axiovert Model 35 microscope with a Nikon CCD camera at 24

22

hours and 6 days. For each condition 3 scaffold replicates were made and images were taken of 4 fields

23

of views per scaffold.

1

Schwann cells and dissociated DRG neurons were isolated and plated together (1:1 ratio, 100,000 cells in

2

total per scaffold) on OPF+ ridged sheets. The cells were cultured for 4 weeks in MEM supplemented

3

with 15% CBS (HyClone, Logan, Utah, USA), L-glutamine (1.2 mM; Gibco), glucose (7 mg/ml; Sigma

4

Aldrich) and NGF (5 ng/ml; Harlan Bioproducts, Indianapolis, IN, USA), 50 Î¼g/mL of ascorbic acid

5

(Sigma) and 2 Î¼M Forskolin (Sigma). For each condition 3 scaffold replicates were made and images

6

were taken of 4 fields of views per scaffold using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope system.

7

2.11 OPF+ sheet and scaffold preparation and surgical implantation

8

OPF+ sheets and single channel scaffolds were sterilized with serial dilution of ethanol. 2 mm by 6 mm

9

OPF+ sheets with ridges 0.4 mm apart were either coated with laminin (n=1; 100 Î¼g/ml) or had only

10

serum coating (n=1). The scaffold sheet was rolled along the long edged and placed inside the single

11

channel scaffold with 2 mm length. Female Sprague Dawley rats (230 â 300 grams; Harlan Laboratories,

12

Madison, WI) received a laminectomy at level T8-T10 and a complete spinal cord transection was

13

performed at level T9. The scaffold was placed into the transected area and all the muscles were closed

14

with sutures. The animals were cared for by the research team and by veterinarians their staff experienced

15

with care of rats with spinal cord injury daily. All procedures were approved by the Mayo Clinic

16

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and all guidelines were followed in accordance with the

17

National Institute of Health, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research and the United States Public Health

18

Services Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

19

2.12 Tissue preparation and Immunohistochemistry

20

The animals were euthanized 4 weeks after implantation and injury by deep anesthesia and fixed by

21

transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The spinal column was removed en bloc and

22

post fixed for 2 day at 4Â°C. The spinal cords were dissected out and a 1 cm segment with scaffold (T9) in

23

the center was embedded in paraffin. Transverse sections 8 Î¼m thick were made on a Reichert-Jung

24

Biocut microtome (Leica, Bannockburn, IL). Tissue sections were deparaffinized and immunostained as

we have described (Chen et al 2017) using a mouse anti-human neurofilament primary antibody (1:100;

2

DAKO) and a donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated to Cy3.

2.13 Imaging for axon regeneration in scaffolds

4

The sections were imaged using Zeiss Axiovert Model 35 microscope with a Nikon CCD camera. The

5

microscope contained a motorized stage and the tiling feature was used in the Zen Blue (Zeiss) software

6

to image the whole scaffold section. Neurofilament staining identified the axons running through the

7

scaffold.

2.14 Statistics

9

All data are reported as mean Â± standard error of the mean (SEM). All statistics were calculated using

10

GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA). Statistical significance was calculated using one-

11

way ANOVA with multiple comparisons using Tukeyâs post-hoc testing (unless stated otherwise). On

12

graphs p-values are represented as *p< 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p< 0.001, **** p< 0.0001.

3. Results

14

3.1 Ridged OPF+ Sheet Characterization

15

0.08 mm thick OPF+ sheets were embedded with longitudinal ridges spaced 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, or 1 mm

16

apart (Figure 1A). Our previously used scaffold was fabricated with 7 channels that were 2mm wide and

17

32 mm long (Figure 1B). Swelling ratios were calculated to be 10.5 Â± 0.8 for OPF+ sheets with 1 mm

18

spaced ridges, 9.8 Â± 0.4 for sheets with 0.4 mm spaced ridges, and 9.7 Â± 0.1 for sheets with 0.2 mm

19

spaced ridges (Figure 1C). Hydrated sheets spontaneously rolled into a spiral configuration (Figure 1D

20

and 1E). In comparison to a multichannel scaffold (Figure 1B), the rolled-sheet design allowed for a

21

greater volume of open space inside of the scaffold, and increased surface area that was dependent on the

22

number of loops in the spiral (Figure 1F and 1G). Internal volumes and surface areas were calculated by

23

taking into account the number of channels that form between ridges, ridge separation (mm), length of the

1

cylinder (mm), and ridge width (mm) (Figure 1F). A scaffold sheet with 3x loops increased the volume

2

by 2.6 fold (3.34 mm3 to 8.83 mm3), whereas a sheet with 4x loops has an increase of approximately 3

3

fold (3.34 mm3 to 9.72 mm3) compared to the 7 multichannel OPF+ scaffold design (Figure 1F). There

4

was a similar corresponding increase in surface area where sheets with 3x loops had 1.71 fold increase

5

(45.4 mm2 to 77.7 mm2) and 4x loops had 2.87 fold increase (45.4 mm2 to 130.5 mm2) compared to the 7

6

channel design.

7

3.2 Whole DRG neurite outgrowth is enhanced on laminin-coated sheets

8

Whole DRGs were used to determine the effect of different ECM protein coatings (laminin, fibronectin,

9

and collagen) on promoting neurite outgrowth on OPF+ sheets with ridges 1 mm apart. The explants were

10

observed to consistently settle on or immediately adjacent to a ridge, rather than on the broader, flat

11

intervening surfaces (Figure 2). The DRGs elongated along the ridge, and into the adjacent areas in

12

conditions where ECM protein coatings were present in contrast to OPF+ sheets with serum coating.

13

Within 24 hours of culture, laminin-coated OPF+ sheets had longer neurite outgrowth (708.5 Â± 34.93 Âµm,

14

Figure 2E) than controls with serum coating only (255.7 Â± 37.12 Âµm, p=0.004), fibronectin (288.3 Â± 33.72

15

Âµm, p<0.0001) and collagen (433.6 Â± 74.56 Âµm, p=0.0362). Outgrowth from collagen and fibronectin

16

was not significantly different from serum coated control surfaces. After 48 hours of culture, laminin

17

coated OPF+ sheets (1261 Â± 58.98 Âµm, p <0.0001) continued to support greater neurite outgrowth than

18

serum coated control (445.1 Â± 61.15 Âµm), fibronectin (731.9 Â± 69.99 Âµm, p<0.0001), and collagen (817.3

19

The outgrowth rate (Âµm/h) of whole DRG neurites over 48 hours in culture between the different ECM

21

coatings (Figure 2F) was compared. In the first 24 hours laminin (29.52 Â± 1.45 Âµm/h, p=0.017) enabled a

22

higher rate of neurite outgrowth than was observed on OPF+ sheets with serum coating (10.66 Â± 1.55

23

Âµm/h). There was no significant difference between the outgrowth rates of fibronectin (11.64 Â± 1.46Âµm;

there were no significant differences between laminin (23.03 Â± 2.85 Âµm/h; p=0.1120), fibronectin (17.64

Â± 2.8 Âµm/h; p=0.6721), and collagen (15.99 Â± 4.87 Âµm/h; p=0.8394) as compared with serum coating

3.3 Dissociated DRG neuron neurite outgrowth is enhanced on laminin coated sheets

5

OPF+ sheets with ridges 1 mm apart and laminin, fibronectin or collagen ECM supported dispersed

6

neuronal cell attachment and outgrowth. On all surfaces, dissociated neurons preferentially attached to the

7

ridges, and aligned their axons longitudinally along the ridge (Figure 3, Supplemental Figure 1). The use

8

of laminin, fibronectin, or collagen increased the number of adherent neurons on the ridge by 3.4 ï± 0.62

9

fold, 2.69 ï± 0.50 fold, and 3.7 ï± 0.32 fold, respectively over ridged sheets with serum coating (Figure 3E).

10

The use of laminin resulted in a greater increase in neuronal attachment (38.1 Â± 5.98 fold) in the spaces

11

between the ridges compared to collagen coating (4.25 Â± 3.3 fold) (p=0.003; figure 3F). Neuronal

12

attachment in between the ridges on fibronectin-coated sheets (32.36 Â± 5.65 fold, p=0.013) was also

13

greater statistically than those attached on collagen-coated sheets. 71.67 Â± 10.76% (p=0.0127) of neurons

14

attached to the ridges on laminin coated sheets, 60.33 Â± 10.67% (p=0.0374) on fibronectin coated sheets,

15

98.33 Â± 12.32 % (p<0.0001) on collagen coated sheets, and 94.33 Â± 12.32% (p<0.0001; 2-way

16

ANOVA/Sidakâs multiple comparison) on serum coated sheets, demonstrating a preferential neuronal

17

attachment onto the ridge (figure 3G).

18

The neurite density of dissociated neurons was also greater on laminin and fibronectin coated sheets

19

(figure 3H), as measured by stereologic analysis of the areas of Î²-tubulin staining. Laminin coated sheets

20

(185.3Â± 41.02 mean gray value; p=0.002) and fibronectin (198.4Â± 30.14 mean gray value; p=0.0408) had

21

higher total Î²- tubulin staining per cell than sheets with serum coating (20.73 Â± 5.59 mean gray value).

22

The neurite density on laminin coated sheets (p= 0.0263) and fibronectin coated sheets (p=0.0408) was

23

also greater than that seen on collagen coated sheets.

3.4 Increasing the number of ridges improves neuronal cell attachment, alignment, and neurite

2

density

3

To determine what effect ridge spacing distance may have on neuronal cell attachment and alignment,

4

laminin-coated OPF+ sheets with ridges 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, and 1 mm apart were used. Tighter ridge

5

spacing increased the number of ridges per area and the overall surface area of the sheet, (figure 4 A-C)

6

which in turn improved neuronal cell attachment. Many of the cells settled around or on top of the ridges,

7

extending neurites along the ridge. The number of neuronal cells located on the ridge surface was 2.5 fold

8

greater for the 0.2 mm spaced OPF+ sheets (figure 4 D; 208.6 Â± 44.3 cells; p=0.039) than the 1 mm OPF+

9

sheets (84.8 Â± 15.1 cells). The 0.4 mm OPF+ sheets (figure 4 D; 186.4 Â± 11.9 cells; p=0.1215) had 2 fold

10

greater number of cells than the 1 mm spaced OPF+ sheets. The neurite density was increased on the

11

OPF+ sheets with ridges more closely spaced (0.2 mm and 0.4 mm apart). We found a 2.9 fold increase

12

in the amount of Î²-III tubulin staining (normalized to the amount of DAPI staining /cell) when comparing

13

OPF+ sheets with 0.2 mm spaced ridges (figure 4 E; 719.5 Â± 130.3 mean grey value; p=0.012) to OPF+

14

sheets with 1 mm spaced ridges (251.2 Â± 33.4 mean grey value).

15

3.5 The number of ridges influences Schwann cell organization and axonal myelination.

16

In our previous studies we have loaded the multichannel scaffolds with genetically modified Schwann

17

cells which facilitated axonal regeneration and recovery after spinal cord transection [5]. We next sought

18

to demonstrate that the OPF+ ridged sheet design with laminin coating would support the growth of

19

Schwann cells. Schwann cells on OPF+ ridged sheets initially formed a cell layer in a dispersed and

20

unorganized manner (Figure 5 A-C). Over a 6 day period the Schwann cells organized along the ridges of

21

the scaffold (Figure 5 D-F). When the Schwann cells were co-cultured with dispersed DRG neurons for

22

4 weeks, neurites became myelinated (Figure 6). Neurites aligned well with the ridges and stained

23

positively for myelin basic protein (MBP). Greater densities of aligned myelinated neurites were

24

observed when the ridges were spaced closer together (0.2 mm spacing vs. 1 mm spacing).

3.6 Rolled OPF+ scaffold sheets, housed within a single channel scaffold, integrated into the spinal

2

cord and supported axon outgrowth into the scaffold after complete transection injury.

3

A proof of principle pilot experiment was conducted in which uncoated and laminin-coated OPF+ sheets

4

with ridges 0.4 mm apart, were rolled and secured inside a single channel OPF+ scaffold (Figure 7A).

5

This scaffold was then implanted into the transected rat spinal cord at the T9 level. The scaffold integrated

6

well with the spinal cord over a 4 week period (Figure 7B). Staining for Î²-III tubulin indicates that both

7

scaffolds promoted axon outgrowth into the scaffold (Figure 7C-D). Although the number of animals was

8

not powered to determine statistical significance (n=1 per condition), these preliminary results show the

9

potential of our novel rolled scaffold for spinal cord regeneration.

10

4. Discussion

11

We have previously demonstrated that OPF+ fabricated in a multichannel design with seven channels can

12

enhance regeneration after SCI [4, 7] in rats. This regeneration can be further improved by loading the

13

channels with GDNF-secreting Schwann cells, leading to modest functional recovery [5]. We have also

14

shown that the OPF+ material can be modified by incorporating the anti-fibrotic drug rapamycin in PLGA

15

microspheres [27]. OPF+ multichannel scaffolds containing rapamycin microspheres were also combined

16

with Schwann cells to help promote functional recovery following SCI. It was also noted from these

17

studies that many of the regenerating axons grew on the outer circumferential surface of the scaffold. We

18

therefore hypothesized that axonal growth may preferentially occur on surfaces rather than within open

19

spaces. Maximizing the surface areas available to regenerating axons to extend may further improve the

20

density and directionality of regrowth, and impact upon functional reconnections. In this study, we have

21

now demonstrated, in vitro, that OPF+ fabricated in a flat sheet design with ridges increased the surface

22

area available for growth when compared to the multichannel design scaffold. Providing an attractive

23

ECM protein coat and spacing the ridges closer together improved cell attachment, outgrowth, and

1

alignment of DRG explants, neurons, and Schwann cells. We also demonstrated that this scaffold design

2

is feasible to use in vivo.

3

When hydrated, the OPF+ sheets spontaneously form a 3D spiral tube. Hydrogels have been designed to

4

self-roll in previous studies either by introducing reductants to cleave disulfide bonds [28], changes in pH

5

and sacrificial layers [29], or using light responsive inks [30] and photolithography [31]. These ridged

6

scaffolds had swelling ratios comparable to our previous studies [32]. Hydrogels may suffer from low

7

cell attachment due to the hydrated surface layer [33]. This issue could be addressed by coating the

8

hydrogel sheets with collagen, laminin, or fibronectin, all of which are classically established as ECM

9

coatings used to promote neurite outgrowth [6, 13, 34, 35]. The current study shows that DRG explants

10

cultured on laminin coated OPF+ sheets had longer neurite outgrowth than fibronectin or collagen coated

11

sheets. In addition, the outgrowth rate of neurites on laminin coated sheets was faster in the first 24 hours

12

of culture. This can be due to the different amount of proteins used or absorbed into the scaffold.

13

Previous studies have demonstrated concentration dependent differences in cell attachment and

14

outgrowth, however, concentrations used in this study were within range of those used in other studies [6,

15

24, 36, 37]. It is also interesting to note that the DRG outgrowth rate on the fibronectin coated sheets was

16

still increasing at the 24-48 hour time point and may have results in greater outgrowth length at a later

17

time point. When neuronal attachment was measured on or in between the ridges, laminin and fibronectin

18

did equally well. The observed enhancement of neuronal outgrowth and guidance associated with laminin

19

is in keeping with several other studies investigating different substrates for neuronal regeneration [6, 13,

20

35, 38]. ECM proteins or their fragments play an important role in cell adhesion through ligand receptor

21

interactions, and these interactions may be an important component to consider in developing novel

22

biomaterials [39-41]. In addition, the three dimensional structure of ECMs help anchor cells and provide

23

axonal guidance [15]. We show that to maximize the ability of hydrogel scaffolds to anchor neurons and

24

their axons and aid in their outgrowth, ECMs like laminin and fibronectin are necessary to maximize the

25

regenerative capability of the scaffold.

1

The combination of a scaffold containing ridges and ECM may mimic what is seen in development where

2

topographical and chemical cues help guide axons. Factors such as stiffness of the substrate can be

3

important in determining the growth patterns of neurons, as shown by the growth of retinal ganglion cell

4

axons towards softer tissue [42]. Laminin and Î²-integrin signaling have been found to be important in

5

neuronal polarization and the deletion of Î²-integrin results in deficits in axonal development [43]. Radial

6

glia, similar to the ridges of the scaffold, provide topographical cues that orientate the migration of

7

embryonic neurons [44]. Neurite outgrowth from DRG explants and disassociated DRG neurons could be

8

directed in a bidirectional way on ridged surfaces in this study. Ridges may provide important

9

topographical cues, as the majority of neurons preferentially attached on or near the ridges of the scaffold.

10

A similar preference for mechanical guidance cues (microgrooves), rather than on flat spaces between the

11

microgrooves, has previously been observed [13]. Studies investigating the effect of grooves on a

12

polymer surface have shown that axonal alignment and behavior could be influenced by the depth of the

13

grooves, spacing between the grooves, and groove widths [13, 38]. Similarly, in our study, disassociated

14

DRG neurons that grew on the OPF+ sheets with ridges spaced 0.2 mm apart had greater cell attachment

15

to the ridges, alignment, and outgrowth than those grown on 1 mm spaced sheets. One of the goals of the

16

scaffold is to bridge the gap that is created after spinal cord injury. The ability of the scaffold to direct

17

growth in a longitudinal direction and maximize this directed growth is an important consideration.

18

Another approach to enhancing regeneration is to mimic the peripheral nervous system environment. It is

19

well established that the peripheral nervous system has a better ability to regenerate than the central

20

nervous system. This may be due to a more rapid clearance and recycling of myelin debris, more

21

permissive ECM, and a neurotrophic Schwann cell response [45]. The use of Schwann cells with

22

biomaterials recreates a peripheral nervous system environment in the spinal cord, where the cells can

23

contribute regenerative ECM, growth factors, and facilitate remyelination. Our lab, among others, has

24

compared different cell types. Schwann cells have been found to be best able to support axonal

25

regeneration [10, 26, 46, 47]. In this study, Schwann cells preferentially organized along the ridges of

1

OPF+ sheets and myelinated neurites. The OPF+ sheet with ridges spaced 0.2 mm apart had more aligned

2

myelinated neurites observable per area than the 1 mm sheet. This combination of the OPF+ ridged sheet

3

with an ECM and Schwann cells may increase the regenerative potential of the scaffold and these in vitro

4

results suggest that this combination would be helpful in guiding and myelinating aligned axons.

5

This study demonstrates a novel hybrid design of the OPF+ scaffold for use in regenerative medicine,

6

particularly suited for spinal cord injury. It has properties similar to the spinal cord, maximizes available

7

surface area and volume for regeneration, and can spontaneously roll to make a 3D structure for

8

transplantation. Flattened, ridged sheets were used for in vitro studies and demonstrated improved neuron

9

attachment, axonal alignment, and outgrowth. Furthermore, it would be straightforward to manufacture

10

and scale for large animal studies and clinical applications. Scaffold properties can be modified including

11

varying the ridge distance and size, as well as, coating with different substances. It is also possible to

12

study different cell types for different applications in regenerative medicine. In a small study when

13

implanted into transected spinal cord, the rolled scaffold integrated well and supported regenerating

14

axons. This scaffold is well positioned to be used for combinatorial treatments to treat spinal cord injury

15

through use of novel biomaterials, ECMs, and cells.

Figure 1: Ridged OPF+ sheet fabrication and characteristics. (A) After crosslinking of OPF polymer

2

on Teflon molds, OPF+ sheets contain 100 Âµm high ridges that are spaced 0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, and 1 mm

3

apart. (B) OPF+ has previously been fabricated as a multichannel scaffold with 7 channels and is as wide

4

as a rat spinal cord. We previously demonstrated that axons grown through the channels, as well as the

5

outside surface (Chen et al, 2018). (C) The swelling ratio of OPF+ sheets were similar to each other and

6

greater than the OPF neutral charged sheet. Bars are represent mean Â± SEM. (D) and (E) When the

7

ridged scaffold is rehydrated it spontaneously rolls up into a 3D configuration along the axis of the ridges.

Figure 6: Confocal images showing Schwann cells co-cultured with disassociated DRG neuron on

3

OPF+ sheets with ridges spaced 0.2 mm or 1 mm apart. The cells were labelled with Î²-III tubulin

4

staining (red, A, C, D & F), Myelin Basic Protein (teal, B, C, E & F), and DAPI (blue, C & F). After

5

culture in media that supports myelination by Schwann cells, the Schwann cells myelinate the

6

disassociated DRG neurites. Since alignment is enhanced by having the ridges on the OPF+ sheet closer

7

together, it can be observed that there are more aligned myelinated neurites on the 0.2 mm spaced OPF+

8

sheets (A-C) than 1 mm spaced sheets (D-E).
