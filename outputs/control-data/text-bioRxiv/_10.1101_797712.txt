Abstract

21

Accurate, rapid, and comprehensive biodiversity assessments are critical for investigating

22

ecological processes and supporting conservation efforts. Environmental DNA (eDNA)

23

surveys show promise as a way to effectively characterize fine-scale patterns of community

24

composition, but most studies to date have evaluated its effectiveness in single habitats

25

and for conspicuous taxonomic groups in temperate ecosystems. We tested whether a

26

single PCR survey of eDNA in seawater using a broad metazoan primer could identify

27

differences in community composition between five adjacent habitats at 19 sites across a

28

tropical Caribbean bay in Panama. We paired this effort with visual fish surveys to compare

29

methods for a conspicuous taxonomic group. eDNA revealed a tremendous diversity of

30

animals (8,586 operational taxonomic units), including many small taxa that would be

31

undetected in traditional in situ surveys. Fish comprised only 0.07% of the taxa detected by

32

a broad COI primer, yet included 43 species not observed in the visual survey. eDNA

33

revealed significant differences in fish and invertebrate community composition across

34

adjacent habitats and areas of the bay driven in part by taxa known to be habitat-

35

specialists or tolerant to wave action. Our results demonstrate the ability of broad eDNA

36

surveys to identify biodiversity patterns in the ocean.

Introduction

38

Coastal regions make up less than 10% of the Earth’s surface but their ecosystems

39

contribute disproportionately to the globe’s primary productivity, biodiversity, and

40

ecosystem services 1–4. Coral reefs alone are thought to be home to 25% or more of

41

described marine species5. Human activities such as coastal development, exploitative

42

fishing practices, and eutrophication, however, have resulted in the widespread decline of

43

commercially-important fisheries, the loss of important habitat-forming species, and

44

biological invasions6–8. The accelerating pace of changes in the structure and function of

45

coastal ecosystems due to these impacts makes it urgently important to develop methods

46

for efficient and effective biomonitoring to support management, conservation, and basic

47

science initiatives9.

48

Systematic survey data are especially fundamental in understanding the link

49

between biodiversity and the health and functioning of marine ecosystems10–12. At its core,

50

biomonitoring requires the reliable identification of species that are present in an

51

environment, and answers if, how, and why populations of these species change over time.

52

Yet, it still remains a challenge to capture the full taxonomic diversity of ecosystems in a

53

repeatable way to identify trends through time and patterns across space13. Traditional

54

marine biodiversity surveying methods, such as visual surveys by divers, are often

55

expensive, invasive, require taxonomic expertise, are limited by visibility or habitat

56

complexity, and miss cryptic diversity, including most invertebrates14–16. As a result, such

57

traditional techniques are prone to miss many species or even entire taxonomic and

58

functional groups, and are sensitive to observer bias14,17–20.

59
60

Sampling environmental DNA (eDNA), the genetic material shed by organisms into
the surrounding environment (e.g., blood, mucus, waste, scales, etc.15), may avoid the

61

shortcomings of traditional survey techniques, and thereby provide a powerful and

62

repeatable approach to assess biodiversity15,16,21–26. Studies have shown the promise of

63

eDNA metabarcoding for detecting specific target taxa and elucidating richness and

64

community composition patterns in taxonomically focused surveys using species- or group-

65

specific primers. Relatively few marine studies, however, have explicitly tested whether

66

broad range eDNA surveys potentially targeting all metazoans simultaneously in a single

67

PCR assay could effectively detect fine-scale patterns of community composition in spatially

68

heterogeneous coastal seascapes22,27,28. Moreover, none of these studies were conducted

69

in the tropics, nor validated with visual surveys on subsets of the sampled communities. In

70

this era of unprecedented biodiversity loss8,29, development of a reliable community-wide

71

approach to assess tropical marine biodiversity across greater spatial and temporal scales

72

would provide a more holistic picture of ecosystem health and functioning by establishing

73

patterns of biodiversity and possible species linkages between habitats.

74

Here, we test the efficacy of a broad metazoan eDNA metabarcoding survey in

75

tropical marine environments and validate the approach with an established visual survey

76

protocol [i.e., Reef Life Surveys (RLS)30] for fish. We examined fish and invertebrate

77

communities in multiple interconnected tropical habitats that have traditionally been

78

challenging to survey comprehensively despite their critical functional roles — e.g., they

79

host considerable biodiversity, serve as important nurseries for juveniles, and sustain high

80

levels of productivity31–35. The semi-enclosed Almirante Bay in the Bocas del Toro

81

archipelago on the Caribbean coast of Panama is an ideal system for testing the ability of

82

eDNA to capture fine-scale patterns of marine diversity. It contains all the primary tropical

83

coastal habitats including coral reefs, seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, sandy

84

unvegetated bottoms, and human-made structures, each with distinct communities that

85

are in close proximity, forming a heterogeneous seascape36,37. Almirante Bay is also one of

86

the best studied areas in the Caribbean, both taxonomically and ecologically. A large-scale

87

biodiversity survey conducted in 2003 and 2004 across the bay36 reported 1183 species of

88

marine invertebrates, 128 species of fish38 and helped establish an online database of

89

species reported from the area, with photos (available at

90

https://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/bocas_database/). Since then, annual taxonomic workshops

91

have been held in the area36,39,40 and the database has expanded to include over 6,500

92

terrestrial and marine plant, animal, and fungi species. Over 80% of the fishes reported by

93

the database are represented in GenBank for the animal barcode cytochrome c. oxidase

94

subunit I (COI) gene. Almirante Bay has also served as a natural laboratory for numerous

95

ecological studies utilizing visual survey and experimental methods to look at the response

96

of coral reefs and associated reef fauna to anthropogenic and environmental stress41–45.

97

The objectives of our study were to 1) examine patterns of community composition

98

for metazoans using eDNA and 2) validate the resolution of a broad COI metazoan primer

99

by comparing the subset of fish taxa detected by eDNA to those identified in traditional

100

visual fish surveys and previously assembled taxonomic lists of reported species. We

101

hypothesized that despite the potential for eDNA in seawater to mix across habitat

102

boundaries27, eDNA surveys would detect habitat-specific patterns of community

103

composition and structure across the highly diverse mangrove-seagrass-coral reef

104

complex.

Materials and Methods

106

Study Sites

107

The field component for this study was conducted in Almirante Bay of the Bocas del

108

Toro archipelago (Figure 1) on the Caribbean coast of Panama from May to July 2017. A

109

total of 19 study sites that span a wide gradient of environmental conditions were sampled;

110

they were separated by distances ranging from 20 m to 6,000 m and included areas

111

exposed to, and sheltered from, open ocean swell (Figure 1, Table S1). Six of these areas

112

were previously established Smithsonian Marine Global Earth Observatory (MarineGEO)

113

monitoring sites that each contained adjacent mangrove, seagrass, coral reef and sandy

114

bottom habitats. Eight additional sites contained only mangrove and seagrass habitats, and

115

five were boat docks (Figure 1). Additional site information can be found in Supplementary

116

Table S1. Surveys in mangrove habitat were conducted in and around the submerged

117

portion of Rhizophora mangle stands (1-2 m depth). Surveys in seagrass habitat were

118

conducted in meadows dominated by Thalassia testudinum (2-4 m depth). Surveys in coral

119

habitat were conducted in reef areas that were dominated by Porites spp. finger corals and

120

Agaricia tenuifolia (2-5 m).

121

eDNA Surveys

122

The eDNA workflow involved filtering and extracting eDNA from a water sample and

123

amplifying specific regions of DNA using a broad COI metazoan primer set during PCR. The

124

resulting amplicons were then sequenced on a massively parallel sequencing platform and

125

compared to a reference database of partially or fully characterized genomes of organisms

126

to identify the taxa present in the environmental sample26.

127

Sample collection

128

Three replicate one-liter seawater samples were collected from each of four habitat

129

types (mangrove, seagrass, coral, sand) at the six MarineGEO monitoring sites (n = 72) and

130

from mangrove and seagrass habitats at eight additional sites (n = 48). At the five dock

131

sites, a 1 L water sample was taken from each of the two sides of each dock; there was one

132

dock at three of the sites and 2 docks at two of the sites (n = 14). In total, 134 water

133

samples were collected (see Supplementary Table S1).

134

Water samples were collected by opening a translucent bleach-sterilized wide-

135

mouth polypropylene sampling bottle directly above (10 – 30 cm) the surface of the habitat

136

without disturbing benthic sediments. Samples were filtered immediately on the boat after

137

collection when possible, but occasionally frozen at -20ºC until filtering. There was no

138

difference in the amount of DNA extracted (t-test, P = 0.55) or in PCR yield (P = 0.14) from

139

freshly filtered versus frozen samples (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). Water samples

140

were vacuum-filtered onto sterile 47 mm diameter 0.45 µm cellulose nitrate filters (GE Life

141

Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA and ThermoScientific, Rochester, USA) with a peristaltic pump

142

head following the “Environmental DNA Sampling Protocol #2” prepared by the U.S.

143

Geological Survey46. One 1 L field blank was also collected per sampling event (n = 19 total)

144

as a negative control (a 1 L bottle of deionized water was left open during filtration of the

145

triplicate eDNA samples in the field and then filtered as described above). Filters were

146

stored in sterile 15 mL falcon tubes at -20°C, then transferred to a -80°C freezer before

147

extraction.

148

DNA Extraction

149

Half of each cellulose nitrate filter was cut up into smaller pieces for DNA extraction

150

using sterile snips and the other half was archived at -80ºC. DNA was extracted using the

151

DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA) with the following modifications to the

152

manufacturer’s protocol. First, we increased the total volume of Powerbead solution (950µL

153

total) and C1 solution (80 µL total) to fully submerge filter pieces. Second, we incubated

154

samples in a water bath at 65ºC for 10 minutes directly following bead beating to increase

155

the yield. Third, we eluted the DNA in 75 µL of Solution C6 to increase the final

156

concentration. The concentration of each DNA extract was quantified using the Qubit

157

dsDNA HS Assay (Invitrogen, Ca, USA), and the approximate molecular weight of a selected

158

number of DNA extracts was visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel by electrophoresis.

159
160

Amplification and Sequencing
A 313 bp fragment of the variable region of the mitochondrial COI gene47 was

161

amplified for each sample with a set of PCR primers designed to target metazoans

162

(mlCOIintF and jgHCO2198, full primer sequences can be found in Supplementary Table

163

S2). To combine samples into a sequencing run on the Illumina MiSeq platform, each

164

sample was assigned a unique combination of indices following the adapter ligation

165

method48. The first index was added to the target fragments during PCR amplification using

166

tailed-PCR primers (i.e., PCR primers to which unique 6-base-pair indices were added at the

167

5’ end) and the second index was added to the product of amplification in the form of

168

standard single-indexed Illumina TruSeq Y-adapters. PCR amplifications were conducted

169

three times for each sample. Each 20 µL PCR reaction contained 2 µL of Clontech

170

Advantage 2 PCR buffer (10x), 1 µL of each primer (10µM), 1.4 µL of dNTP mix (10 mM), 0.4

171

µL of 50X Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix (50x), 13.2 µL PCR-grade water, and 1 µL of DNA

172

extract. The following cycling conditions were used: 5 minutes at 95°C (1x); 1 min at 95°C,

173

30 s at 48°C, and 45 s at 72°C (38x); 5 min at 72°C (1x). PCR negative controls were

174

conducted alongside samples to test for the presence of contaminants. PCR replicates were

175

pooled, purified using magnetic KAPA Pure Beads (bead:sample ratio of 1.6:1) and

176

quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay. Equimolar amounts of PCR products amplified

177

with distinct tailed PCR primers were pooled before ligation of single-indexed adapters (see

178

Supplementary Table S3 for the multiplexing protocol) following the protocol of the

179

Illumina TruSeq PCR-Free LT kit. All libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer,

180

equimolar amounts pooled into a single tube, and the final product validated using a KAPA

181

qPCR library quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA). The

182

library was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with an Illumina MiSeq v2 500-cycle kit.

183

We also attempted to amplify and sequence the water samples using the fish-

184

specific 12S MiFish primers for additional validation, but we had limited success with PCR

185

amplification using these primers. This may be due to the low concentration of fish DNA

186

present in our water samples. For this reason, we do not report further on the fish-specific

187

amplicon sequencing part of this study, but additional details for the MiFish amplicon

188

method used can be found in the Supplementary Information document.

189

Analysis of sequence data

190

Reads were demultiplexed and Illumina adapters were trimmed using Flexbar

191

version 3.0.349. The demultiplexed and adapter trimmed FASTQ files can be accessed on

192

the NCBI SRA under the BioProject accession number PRJNA558350. Negative control

193

samples that failed DNA extraction, PCR amplification, or initial quality control checks after

194

demultiplexing were not uploaded. Adapter-trimmed reads were then further trimmed to

195

ensure that all primer regions were removed, filtered for quality, merged, checked for

196

chimeric sequences, and used to infer exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with

197

DADA2 version 1.9.050,51 (DADA2 parameters: maxN = 0, maxEE = c(2,2), truncQ = 10,

198

trimLeft = 26, with pseudo-pooling). ASVs were clustered into operational taxonomic units

199

(OTUs) at a 97% identity threshold using VSEARCH52. OTUs were further processed with the

200

LULU algorithm (GitHub commit f4a880d), which curates OTUs based on sequence identity

201

and co-occurrence patterns, in order to reduce taxonomic redundancy and improve the

202

accuracy of richness estimates (LULU parameters: minimum_ratio_type = "min",

203

minimum_ratio = 1, minimum_match = 84, minimum_relative_cooccurence = 0.95)53. OTUs

204

were assigned taxonomic information using the Bayesian Least Common Ancestor (BLCA)

205

Taxonomic Classification software54 (GitHub commit 3b41b98) against Midori-Unique

206

v20180221, a curated database of metazoan mitochondrial gene sequences (available at

207

www.reference-midori.info)55. BLCA taxonomic rank assignments with less than 50%

208

confidence were discarded. OTUs that remained unidentified with BLCA were compared to

209

the whole NCBI NT database (retrieved May 2018) using BLAST searches (word size = 7;

210

max e-value = 5e-13) and assigned the taxonomic information of the lowest common

211

ancestor of the top 100 hits.

212

OTUs that were identified down to species level were cross-checked with the species

213

lists from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute’s Bocas del Toro species database

214

(https://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/bocas_database/, retrieved 3/9/2019), previous literature on

215

Caribbean biodiversity13, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System for the Bocas region

Visual Fish Surveys

220
221

To quantify the richness and composition of fish communities in coastal habitats
across the network of 19 sites, two scuba divers conducted visual fish surveys following the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/797712; this version posted October 8, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

222

Reef Life Survey (RLS) protocol30. These divers counted, identified to the highest taxonomic

223

resolution possible, and assigned to binned size-classes all fish greater than 2.5 cm in

224

length observed along a 50 x 10 m belt transect positioned parallel to shore. One transect

225

was conducted in each of the same habitats and sites as the eDNA survey (Figure 1, Table

226

S1) for a total of 43 transects. Due to the inability to swim through the mangrove habitat,

227

two 50 m transect lines were deployed along the edge of the mangrove and a diver looked

228

5 m to one side of each of the primary prop roots and under overhanging roots for fish.

229

These mangrove transects were then pooled together into a single transect. Dock sites

230

were sampled similarly to the mangroves, with divers swimming along the edge of the

231

structure looking inward. When fish were in large schools, counts were estimated to the

232

nearest power of ten. Unidentifiable individuals were photographed for later identification

233

using reef fish identification books56 and online databases (e.g., FishBase57, Smithsonian

234

Identification Guide - Shorefish of the Greater Caribbean58). The same two divers

235

conducted all visual surveys after a period of training to ensure consistency.

236

Analysis of diversity patterns

237

Community analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.159 using the phyloseq60,

238

vegan61, and DESeq262 packages. Machine learning analysis was conducted using the h2o

239

package63. Visualizations were done with the Plotly64 and ggplot2 packages65.

240

Raw counts were transformed to relative abundances before calculating a

241

dissimilarity matrix based on the Bray-Curtis metric. Bray-Curtis takes into account

242

differences in abundance of reads between samples; a value of 0 indicates that samples

243

are exactly identical in terms of OTU composition and relative abundance of reads whereas

244

a value of 1 indicates that samples do not have any OTUs in common. The variance in

245

community composition was calculated using a PERmutational Multivariate ANalysis Of

246

VAriance (PERMANOVA)66 computed with 10000 free permutations. The following terms

247

were used as factors: region within the bay, habitat, geographic site, diver (for the visual

248

survey), and the interaction terms between bay region and habitat, and site and habitat.

249

We calculated the accuracy with which a machine learning algorithm was able to

250

assign a sample to its source habitat based on OTU composition to understand how

251

consistently distinct the assemblage was for a given habitat in Bocas del Toro. We selected

252

a random forest classifier over other approaches because of the high-dimensionality of our

253

data, the relative ease of tuning a distributed random forest algorithm, and the ability of

254

random forest algorithms to calculate feature importance. LULU-curated metazoan OTUs

255

were filtered to only include taxa that occurred at more than 5e-5 relative abundance

256

(approximately five reads on average) in at least five samples. OTUs were then used as

257

predictors in a random forest classifier with source habitat (coral reef, mangrove, seagrass,

258

sand, dock) as the response variable with 5-fold cross-validation using the h2o machine

259

learning platform63. Cross-validation is a statistical term for training a model on the

260

majority of the data while withholding some data to be used to test the model. Since the

261

withheld data were not used to train the model, the model has never seen them before,

262

thereby providing a better estimate of how accurate the model would be on new data.

263

Hyperparameters were chosen by grid search optimizing for logarithmic loss using ‘h2o’.

264

The model parameters with the smallest logarithmic loss value during cross-validation

265

were selected and used to build a random forest from which feature importance

266

information was extracted.

267

To examine differences in specific pairwise habitat and exposure comparisons

268

(exposed vs. sheltered, mangrove vs. seagrass habitat, and coral vs. sand habitat),

269

differential abundance analysis of visual survey detections and OTUs of fish and metazoans

270

between habitats was conducted using Wald t-tests in the DESeq2 package62. Coral and

271

sand sites were only contrasted with each other because each only had six sites, while

272

mangrove and seagrass sites had 12 sites each. Variance stabilizing transformation was

273

used on the count data to standardize downstream visualization using heatmaps.

Results

275

Metazoan community composition

276

PCR amplification of the mitochondrial COI gene with a general primer set was

277

successful for all 134 water samples whereas all negative field, extraction and PCR controls

278

remained blank. A total of 14,376,785 raw paired end reads were obtained and 12,708,398

279

(88.4%) remained after filtering, chimera removal, and processing.

280

The vast majority of the reads (99.5%) from seawater were assigned to non-fish taxa

281

such as invertebrate animals, unicellular eukaryotes (i.e., diatoms and picozoans), algae or

282

bacteria (Figure 2). Metazoans made up 8,781 OTUs (out of 23,123 total OTUs) consisting of

283

5,479,007 paired reads (43% of total). Of these, approximately 10% of sequences were

284

identified to species (526,898 read pairs comprising 387 OTUs). OTU richness and alpha

285

diversity (Shannon’s Index, H’) was highest in mangrove habitats (4,939 OTUs, 5.127 ± 1.63)

286

and lowest in coral reef habitats (1,680 OTUs, 4.912 ± 0.069) (Table 1).

287

A larger portion of the variation in the metazoan eDNA data was explained by

288

sampling site (R2=29.1%) and the interaction term between habitat and sampling site

289

(R2=17.2%). PERMANOVA analysis indicated significant differences between geographic

290

areas (exposure), habitats, sites and all interactions between factors (Table 2). Despite

291

targeting a much broader range of taxa (including fish and numerous invertebrates), the

292

whole metazoan eDNA sequencing found similar patterns of community dissimilarity

293

across the sampling region and between habitats (PERMANOVA, Table 2) as the visual and

294

the subset of the eDNA dataset assigned to fish.

295

A distributed random forest algorithm correctly predicted the source habitat of the

296

samples an average of 83% and 68% of the time in total and in cross-validation,

297

respectively. Mangrove samples were the most likely to be correctly classified during cross-

298

validation (81% correct) while coral reef samples were the least likely (44%) (Figure 3). While

299

many of the taxa that were important predictors in the random forest classification

300

algorithm were unidentified taxa, a number of identified taxa were species known to

301

occupy mangrove roots, such as Haliclona manglaris, Isognomon alatus, and Dendostrea

302

frons. (Supplementary File S1).

303

The identity and abundance of metazoan OTUs differed between mangrove and

304

seagrass habitats (Supplementary Figure S3), between reefs and sand habitats

305

(Supplementary Figure S4), and by exposure (Figure 4). There were more OTUs that

306

significantly (adjusted p-value < 0.05) differed in abundance when comparing exposed

307

versus sheltered sites than any of the habitat comparisons. Samples generally consisted of

308

invertebrate OTUs that were unidentifiable past the phylum level. Of eDNA OTUs with

309

species-level assignment, the symmetrical brain coral, Pseudodiploria strigosa, and sponge

310

Placospongia carinata were more abundant in exposed sites, while the mangrove periwinkle

311

(Littoraria angulifera), European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), eared ark clam (Andara

312

notabilis) and planktonic copepod Oncaea waldemari were more abundant in sheltered sites

313

(Fig 4).

314

Of the OTUs identified to species level, only 154 (40%) had been previously reported

315

in the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute Bocas del Toro species database or OBIS at

316

the time of analysis (see Supplementary File S2 for exact lists). Interestingly, four of the

317

species detected in the eDNA, including two terrestrial species, are listed as invasive in the

318

Caribbean by the Global Invasive Species Database: the bryozoan Bugula neritina, the crab

319

Charybdis hellerii, the ant Monomorium pharaonis, and the common house mouse Mus

320

musculus. DNA from these invasive species was observed in more than 3 water samples,

321

and all were at very low relative abundances (Bugula neritina: 46 reads, Charybdis hellerii: 7

322

reads, Monomorium pharaonis: 186 reads, Mus musculus: 21 reads). We speculate that the

323

terrestrial invasive species DNA is likely from local sewage sources and/or runoff rather

324

than laboratory contamination, since these are species known to occur in the area and

325

were not found in any negative or positive controls.

Fish Community Composition

327

In the eDNA survey, reads assigned to bony fishes (Osteichthyes) made up a median

328

of only 0.07% of the total reads per sample with no sample containing more than 5.2% fish

329

reads. We detected 79 fish species (86 OTUs) which accounted for a total of 26,724 paired

330

reads (Table 1). 93% (80/86 OTUs) had a species-level identification, with two OTUs

331

identified as the same species. 66.6% (4/6) of OTUs only had a family-level identification,

332

and 33% (2/6) of OTUs only had a class-level identification. Six out of 134 eDNA sample

333

replicates did not contain hits to fish, but every habitat within each site had hits to fish

334

when triplicate samples were combined. The highest mean read abundance of bony fishes

335

among habitats was recovered from the dock sites (per sample mean ± SE: 506±160),

336

followed by mangrove habitats (per sample mean ± SE: 436±160) (Table 1).

337

Mangrove habitats harbored the highest average read diversity for fish based on

338

Shannon diversity indices, followed by seagrass, dock, sand, and finally coral reef habitats

339

(Table 1). Samples from the Salt Creek mangrove MarineGEO site, located outside the bay,

340

contained among the highest number of hits to fish species (10,229 reads), followed by the

341

Ferry dock site located inside the bay (1,510 reads). The fish species with the highest

342

number of reads were the clupeid big-eye anchovy (Anchoa lamprotaenia; 11,312 reads),

343

striped parrotfish (Scarus iseri; 1,700 reads), and clupeid hardhead silverside (Atherinomorus

344

stipes; 1,671 reads). Sheltered sites had a higher species richness and diversity (6034 OTUs,

345

Shannon’s H= 5.172) than exposed sites (4781 OTUs, Shannon’s H = 4.934).

346

For the visual fish survey, over 7,000,000 individuals (5,523 kg) and 97 identifiable

347

species from 42 families were observed in transects covering a total area of 21,500 m2

348

(Table 1). At least one fish individual was observed from each habitat in every site. Fishes

349

that were ubiquitous across all sites and habitats belonged to species that are typically

350

thought of as reef-associated, were already included in the Bocas species database, and

351

were previously observed in surveys of the area (e.g., stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride),

352

threespot damselfish (Stegastes planifrons), bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum)). Of

353

the non-schooling fish species, the masked goby (Coryphopterus personatus) was the most

354

abundant (and third most abundant overall). For a full list of fish species, see

355

Supplementary Table S4.

356

Out of a total of 922 diver observation events (i.e., a species or morphospecies

357

recorded in some abundance on a given transect by a given diver), 838 (91%) were species-

358

level identifications, 20 (2%) were genus-level identifications and 64 were family-level

359

identifications (7%). The family-level observations accounted for 99% of the observed

360

individuals across all study sites. Clupeids (small mid-water “baitfish”) commonly found in

361

mangrove and dock habitats could not be identified to species in most cases because they

362

are small, move quickly, and occur in very large mixed species schools (e.g., up to 1,000,000

363

estimated in a single transect). Clupeids and the second most abundant group, belonids,

364

accounted for 75% of diver observation events that were not identified at the species level.

365

For fishes other than clupeids and belonids, 98% of diver observation events achieved

366

species-level identifications.

367

Comparing fish eDNA and visual survey methods

368

In both the visual surveys and eDNA surveys, we found significant differences in the

369

fish communities observed between different regions of the bay, and between habitats,

370

using the Bray-Curtis index based PERMANOVA (full results in Table 2). There was no clearly

371

visible structure when the community data from the eDNA or visual surveys were

372

ordinated using a Bray-Curtis PCoA (Figure 5). For both surveys, the majority of the

373

explained variation, however, was attributed to the factor “site” which encompasses

374

multiple habitats within a given location, (RLS: R2=25.5%, eDNA: R2=16.8%) and the

375

interaction term between habitat and site (RLS: R2=25.6%, eDNA: R2=20.7%).

376

Visual surveys and eDNA were similar in that each method identified differences

377

between habitats and exposure in the abundance of fish taxa, but they differed in which

378

taxa contributed to this difference (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S4). For example, in

379

visual surveys, nine taxa including schoolmaster snapper (Lutjanus apodus), latin grunt

380

(Haemulon steindachneri), and yellowfin mojarra (Gerres cinereus) were more abundant in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/797712; this version posted October 8, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

381

mangrove sites, whereas slippery dick (Halichoeres bivittatus) was more abundant in

382

seagrass sites (Fig 6). On the other hand, the same comparison between mangrove and

383

seagrass sites for the eDNA fish dataset only showed big-eye anchovy (Anchoa

384

lamprotaenia) to be more abundant in mangrove sites (Figure 6). In general, the visual

385

surveys detected more differentially abundant taxa in the habitat and wave exposure

386

comparisons than the eDNA surveys.

387

The visual survey detected 97 fish species, 36 of which overlapped with the eDNA

388

survey and 19 of which were absent in the eDNA (Supplementary Table S4). Of the 79 fish

389

species detected by eDNA, 31 had not been previously recorded in the Bocas or OBIS

390

databases. No detected fish species (except those mis-assigned, see Discussion) were

391

identified as false positives. In total, eDNA metabarcoding with COI and visual surveys

392

detected 140 fish species, 60 of which had not been previously reported in the Bocas

393

database (which had 219 fish species when we initiated our study) and nine of which had

394

not been reported in OBIS. Our total is slightly greater than the number of detected fish

395

species from the most recent and comprehensive record from this region (2005), which

396

reported 128 fish species (85 of which we also report here) from 12 coral reef sites varying

397

in habitat complexity and exposure in Bocas del Toro after 288 visual surveys on

398

comparable transects38. With surveys conducted along 43 transects deployed across five

399

habitat types and using two sampling approaches (i.e., visual and eDNA), we found 65

400

species that were not reported in 200538 and 25 species that were not recorded in the

401

Bocas database. eDNA detected small-sized species (<2.5 cm) and pelagic species that

402

scuba divers did not look for.

403

Discussion

404

The broad-range COI primer set revealed community patterns across a

405

heterogeneous tropical coastal system that were generally consistent with visual surveys of

406

conspicuous fish and the known distribution of invertebrates. Both the eDNA and visual

407

surveys show distinct variation in taxon abundances between habitats and regions in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/797712; this version posted October 8, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

408

bay (Figure 4,6, Table 1). Interestingly, the similar patterns of fish community composition

409

uncovered by the two methods were driven by different pools of fish species. This suggests

410

that eDNA can unveil distribution patterns of fish taxa (as well as invertebrates) previously

411

missed or underreported by visual methods. Our results also indicate that habitat and

412

wave exposure drive the distribution of diversity across various taxonomic groups.

413

Patterns of differential sequence abundance observed between habitats and

414

regions of the bay for metazoan taxa can be verified and explained by their ecology. For

415

example, the massive brain coral Pseudodiploria strigosa was consistently detected by eDNA

416

at exposed sites, as would be expected because of their wave resistant morphology67. This

417

result is also consistent with previous descriptive studies of Bocas del Toro’s reefs, where

418

this species was found more often at sites on the exposed eastern side of Bastimentos

419

Island than on sheltered sites around Colón Island68–70.

420

The proportion of the variance explained by site (which encompass multiple

421

habitats) in the PERMANOVA (visual: R2 = 0.238, eDNA: R2 = 0.270, Table 2) may be

422

indicative of a shared species pool and/or connectivity of habitats in the ecosystem (i.e., the

423

mangrove-seagrass-coral complex) through organism dispersal, migration or movement of

424

seawater that carries eDNA. The variance explained by habitat alone was statistically

425

significant, but relatively small compared to site and site x habitat, indicating differences

426

between habitats at some sites but not others. The physical distance between water

427

samples may have been a larger contributor to the community similarity than the habitat

428

of collection. Alternatively, this could be due to daily differences in weather patterns if

429

wind-driven water movement transported eDNA across habitats at some sites (i.e., as

430

collections were made at all habitats of a site in the same day).

431

The random forest classification was able to detect subtle variation that was

432

informative for classifying the source habitat of the samples, even though only

433

approximately 7% of the variance in Bray-Curtis distances was explained by habitat. Most

434

of the taxa that were important predictors of habitat classification were metazoans not

435

identified to species, but the taxa that could be identified to species tended to be taxa that

436

are known to be specialized on particular habitats. For instance, a number of common

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/797712; this version posted October 8, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

437

mangrove root epibionts were important to the algorithm’s classification accuracy,

438

including the sponge Haliclona manglaris and various bivalves such as the flat tree oyster

439

Isognomon alatus and the mangrove oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae. Because mangroves

440

had the most taxa, they likely contained more unique species associated with it, which

441

improved the accuracy of the classifier. This shows that eDNA is able to pick up multiple

442

species indicative of different habitats separated by only a few meters.

443

This study demonstrates the utility of eDNA as a biomonitoring tool for highly

444

diverse tropical seascapes. In combination with a traditional visual survey, eDNA allowed

445

for a more comprehensive survey of the biodiversity contained in the Bocas del Toro

446

lagoon. Overall, over 8,500 metazoan OTUs were detected in the eDNA, which is

447

comparable to previous estimates of marine metazoan diversity for the entire Caribbean

448

region (10,676 animal species reported in a 2010 study of georeferenced species records

449

and taxonomic lists13). We detected over 200 metazoan OTUs with species-level

450

identifications that had not been previously recorded in the Bocas or OBIS databases. This

451

is particularly notable given that the majority (95%) of metazoan OTUs detected in our

452

study were not identifiable to species with the databases accessed at time of analysis. Even

453

though COI is one of the most commonly sequenced genes for animals, with over 4.5

454

million sequences in the Barcode of Life Data system71,72, we speculate that many small or

455

cryptic taxa that are not well taxonomically described are not adequately represented in

456

GenBank, a point highlighted by the Open Tree of Life project73. In addition, the broad-

457

range COI primers also detected numerous non-metazoan sequences. These sequences

458

represented 53% of the reads, which is around 2–3 times greater in relative abundance

459

than in previous studies sequencing bulk benthic samples utilizing the same COI

460

primers74,75 but comparable to recent estimates for water samples76. This is likely

461

attributable to the lower concentrations of metazoan eDNA in seawater and the broad

462

taxon compatibility of the COI primer set.

463

Successful taxonomic identification in eDNA-based surveys rely on the taxonomic

464

coverage of reference databases. Yet, as highly diverse tropical systems remain poorly

465

sampled, the majority of OTUs remained unidentified to the species level. In addition, OTUs

466

in groups known to have slow rates of COI evolution77 were incorrectly assigned to species

467

that are not known to occur in the area. For example, one octocoral OTU detected as

468

significantly more abundant in exposed sites was assigned as Muricea fruticosa, an eastern

469

Pacific gorgonian species. This OTU is more likely to be one of the many Caribbean

470

gorgonian species with identical COI sequences in the PCR target region (e.g.,

471

Pseudoplexaura porosa and Eunicea flexuosa). Two additional false positives (species not

472

known to inhabit the Caribbean) were detected with the taxonomic assignment method

473

used. Ray OTUs were reported as the Eastern Pacific rays Aetobatus ocellatus and Rhinoptera

474

steindachneri, but are likely the closely-related Western Atlantic species Aetobatus narinari

475

and Rhinoptera brasiliensis or R. bonasus.

476

The co-amplification of numerous non-metazoan taxa lowered the sampling depth

477

of our target organisms (metzoan) and likely prevented the consistent detection of rare

478

taxa. The taxonomic selectivity of primers, rather than environmental factors such as

479

organismal DNA shedding rates, has been argued to be the main driver behind differences

480

in detection between eDNA and visual approaches24. Using more taxon-specific primers

481

could have improved the detection consistency for organisms of interest. PCR yield using

482

MiFish primers that specifically target fish was surprisingly low across samples. It is

483

possible that 1 L water samples did not contain sufficient fish eDNA for consistent

484

amplification with these primers, possibly owing to the overall low fish biomass in our

485

study area relative to other parts of the Caribbean78. Increasing the number of replicates

486

and the volume of water filtered, along with decreasing the size of the pore membrane,

487

may help capture more eDNA for sequencing26. Regardless of these challenges, we were

488

still able to capture a wide array of target taxonomic groups across the animal tree of life

489

simultaneously, including benthic species that would otherwise each be costly in the form

490

of taxonomic expertise, specialized techniques, and effort to observe through traditional

491

visual means.

492

Our study supports the feasibility and utility of using molecular-based approaches

493

for quantifying tropical marine biodiversity with relatively low sampling effort. We found

494

the DNA signature of many invertebrate species and, more surprisingly, of numerous fishes

495

that were not observed during visual surveys or never documented in the area. As we

496

hypothesized, eDNA effectively identified patterns of diversity in fish and invertebrate

497

communities in this heterogeneous seascape despite a high level of variability in the

498

dataset likely due to water circulation. We were able to identify environmental features (i.e,

499

exposure) that drive the distribution of animal communities, and we identified sets of

500

habitat specialized species that are consistent with our visual observations. Utilizing

501

environmental DNA sequencing techniques in biodiversity assessments will be crucial as

502

people continue to balance marine resource use and conservation in tropical coastal

503

ecosystems.
