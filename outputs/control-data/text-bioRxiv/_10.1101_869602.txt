Abstract
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a threat to genome stability. In all domains of life, DSBs are
faithfully fixed via homologous recombination. However, recombination requires the presence of an
uncut copy of duplex DNA that can be used as a template for repair. Alternate to this, in the absence of
a template, eukaryotes and some prokaryotes also utilize Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair.
This pathway, or variations of it, can be error-prone. However, it avoids the lethality of a DSB, making
NHEJ an important form of repair. Although ubiquitously found in eukaryotes, NHEJ is not universally
present in bacteria. It is unclear as to why many prokaryotic systems lack this pathway. To understand
what could have led to the current distribution of NHEJ in bacteria, we carried out comparative
genomics and phylogenetic analysis across ~6000 sequenced genomes. Our results show that this repair
trait is sporadically distributed across the phylogeny, with a few clades that are completely devoid of it.
Ancestral reconstruction suggests that NHEJ was absent in the eubacterial ancestor, followed by
primary independent gains as well as secondary losses and gains, in different clades across the bacterial
history. Further, our analysis suggests that this pattern of occurrence is consistent with the correlated
evolution of NHEJ with key genome characteristics of genome size and growth rates; NHEJ presence
in bacteria is associated with large genome sizes and / or slow growth rates, with the former being the
dominant correlate. Given the central role these traits may play in determining the ability to carry out
recombination, it is possible that the evolutionary history of bacterial NHEJ may have been shaped by
the requirement for efficient DSB repair.

Introduction
Accurate transmission of genetic material from parent to progeny is essential for the continuity of life.
However, low rates of error during replication and DNA break-inducing mutagenic agents such as
ionising radiation and reactive oxygen, while generating diversity for natural selection to act on
(Tenaillon, Denamur, and Matic 2004), also adversely affect viability and could lead to diseases
including cancer (Tomasetti, Li, and Vogelstein 2017; Srinivas et al. 2019). Therefore, most cellular
life forms invest in mechanisms that repair damaged DNA including double strand breaks (DSBs).
Two major mechanisms of repair of DNA double strand breaks are homologous recombination and
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Homologous recombination based repair requires a homologous
copy of the DNA around the damage site for repair to occur. In contrast, NHEJ, the subject of the
present work, directly ligates the double strand break after detecting and binding the break ends
(Aniukwu, Glickman, and Shuman 2008; Bhattarai, Gupta, and Glickman 2014). Where direct ligation
is not possible – at breaks that generate complex ends – a processing step involving the removal of
damaged bases and resynthesis of lost DNA is required. Such processing can be error-prone
(Bétermier, Bertrand, and Lopez 2014). Thus NHEJ can be a double-edged sword: required for
essential DNA repair when a homologous DNA copy is not available, but also prone to causing errors
at complex DNA breaks.
NHEJ is a major mechanism of DNA repair in eukaryotes. In bacteria however, homologous
recombination based repair is the most common mechanism of DNA repair; NHEJ, on the other hand,
was described only recently (Aravind and Koonin 2001; Doherty, Jackson, and Weller 2001), and its
prevalence still remains to be systematically elucidated. Studies in bacteria have found that NHEJ can
participate in repair, and also contribute to mutagenesis such as in stationary phase (Bhattarai, Gupta,
and Glickman 2014; Paris et al. 2015). Experiments in Mycobacterium and Pseudomonas have shown
that bacterial NHEJ repair machinery consists primarily of two proteins – the homodimeric Ku and the
three-domain LigD harbouring ligase (LIG), polymerase (POL) and phosphoesterase (PE) domains
(Aniukwu, Glickman, and Shuman 2008; Stephanou et al. 2007; Zhu and Shuman 2010; Della et al.
2004). In contrast, Bacillus subtilis encodes Ku along with a two-domain (LIG and POL) LigD
(Moeller et al. 2007). In exceptional cases, LigC, which contains only the LIG domain, can carry out
repair in the absence of LigD (Bhattarai, Gupta, and Glickman 2014; Matthews and Simmons 2014;
Aniukwu, Glickman, and Shuman 2008). Though Escherichia coli does not encode NHEJ, expression

of M. tuberculosis Ku and LigD renders E. coli NHEJ proficient (Malyarchuk et al. 2007).
Studies in the early 2000s, with a small number of genomes, suggested that the distribution of NHEJ in
bacteria could be patchy (Bowater and Doherty 2006). Collectively, what does it mean for bacteria like
Escherichia coli to not code for NHEJ and others like Mycobacterium tuberculosis to harbour it? Given
the large population sizes and relatively short generation times that make selection particularly strong,
the question of the pressures that determine the deployment of the potentially risky NHEJ assumes
importance. In this study, using bioinformatic sequence searches of Ku and LigD domains in the
genomic sequences of ~6000 bacteria, we have tried to 1) understand how pervasive their pattern of
occurrence is, 2) trace their evolutionary history and, 3) understand what selection pressures could
explain it.

Methods
Data
All genome information files for ~6000 bacteria were downloaded from the NCBI ftp website using
in-house scripts - whole genome sequences ( .fna), protein coding nucleotide sequences (.fna), RNA
sequences (.fna) and protein sequences (.faa). All the organisms were assigned respective phylum and
subphylum based on the KEGG classification (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/genome.html).

Identification of NHEJ repair proteins
Initial blastp (Altschul et al. 1990) was run using each of the four protein domain sequences – Ku and
LigD (LigD-LIG, LigD-POL and LigD-PE) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 as the query
sequence against the UniProtKB database (“UniProt: A Worldwide Hub of Protein Knowledge”
2019)

with an E-value cut-off of 0.0001. The top 250 full length sequence hits were downloaded from

Uniprot for both Ku and LigD domains respectively. A domain multiple sequence alignment was made
using phmmer -A option with the top 250 hits as the sequence database and P. aeruginosa domain
sequences as the query. An hmm profile was built using the hmmbuild command for the multiple
sequence alignment obtained in the previous step. To find domain homologues, hmmsearch command
with an E-value cut-off of 0.0001 was used with the hmm profile as the query against a database of
5973 bacterial genome sequences (Supplementary table 1). These homolog searches were done using
HMMER package v3.3 (Finn, Clements, and Eddy 2011). An in-house python script was written to

extract the results and assign organisms with Ku and LigD domains.
Bacteria were assigned into five broad categories, based on the status of NHEJ components – NoNHEJ, Ku-only, LigD-only, conventional-NHEJ and non-conventional NHEJ. Conventional NHEJ was
said to be present in bacteria harbouring Ku and LigD having LIG, POL and PE domains in the same
protein. Non-conventional NHEJ included bacteria with Ku and at least one of the following: a) all
LigD domains present in different combinations in different proteins, b) just the LIG and POL domains
present in the same or, c) different proteins and, d) LIG with/without PE domain present in the same or
different proteins. Organisms with PE and/or POL but not the LIG domain detected, were assigned to
No-NHEJ state if Ku domain wasn’t detected either; a Ku-only state if Ku domain was detected.
(Figure 1)

Ku and LigD neighbourhood analysis
In-house python scripts were written to determine the proximity of ku and ligD on the genome using
the annotation files. Taking one gene as the reference, the presence of the other gene was checked
within a distance of 10 genes upstream or downstream inclusive of both strands. The organisation of
NHEJ genes fell into three categories – 1) both genes on the same strand and within the distance range;
this we call as operonic NHEJ, 2) both genes on different strands and within the distance range and 3)
genes outside the distance range. This analysis was done only for NHEJ+ organisms which code for
LigD containing all the three domains as part of a single protein.

Identification of rRNA sequences
A 16S rRNA sequence database was downloaded from the GRD (Genomic-based 16S ribosomal RNA
database) website (https://metasystems.riken.jp/grd/). A multiple sequence alignment and a profile of
the database was made using FAMSA v1.1 (Deorowicz, Debudaj-Grabysz, and Gudyś 2016) and
hmmbuild (Finn, Clements, and Eddy 2011) respectively. To detect 16S rRNA homologues in our
database of 5973 bacteria, we used nhmmer (Wheeler and Eddy 2013) with an E-value cut-off of
0.0001 where the GRD based 16S rRNA sequence profile was used as the query. In-house python
script was written to parse the output files and select the best hits for further analysis.

Calculation of genome sizes, growth rates and G-C content
In-house python scripts were written to calculate the genome sizes, growth rates and G-C content of all

bacteria in our dataset (Supplementary table 1). These calculations were made after excluding the
plasmid sequence information from the whole genome sequence assembly files. Previous studies have
shown a significant positive correlation between a bacteria’s growth rate and the number of rRNA
operons harboured in it’s genome (Vieira-Silva and Rocha 2010; Roller, Stoddard, and Schmidt 2016;
Klappenbach, Dunbar, and Schmidt 2000; Gyorfy et al. 2015). Therefore, as an estimate of growth rate
for a given bacteria, rRNA copy number was taken as a proxy.

Genome size randomization analysis
For this analysis, we only considered 920 organisms harbouring conventional NHEJ. We used the total
number of coding DNA sequences (CDS) as the proxy for genome size. Since the chances of picking
up a gene coming from a larger genome size are more than a smaller genome, we drew 920 genes at
random from a pool of all the genes coming from 5973 organisms in our dataset and every time the
genome CDS size (genome size) from which the gene came from was noted. For this iteration, the
median genome size was calculated. This was repeated for 100 iterations and a distribution of median
genome size was obtained. The non-parametric wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare this
random distribution to the median genome size of NHEJ harbouring bacteria.

Horizontal gene transfer analysis
We used Alien Hunter v1.7 (Vernikos and Parkhill 2006) with default options to predict horizontally
acquired regions (HARs) - based on their oligonucleotide composition - across bacterial genomes
present in our dataset. In-house python scripts were used to detect Ku and LigD in the predicted HARs.
NHEJ was said to be acquired through horizontal gene transfer if both Ku and LigD were present in the
predicted HARs.

Phylogenetic tree construction
For the construction of species tree, one 16S rRNA sequence per genome was extracted into a multifasta file using an in-house python script. For bacteria with multiple 16S rRNA sequences, one 16S
rRNA sequence was chosen such that it minimizes the number of Ns in that sequence and has the
maximum sequence length. In order to build a pruned phylogenetic tree, 970 bacteria were randomly
selected such that a genus was represented exactly once for every NHEJ state. Please note that in the
case of non-conventional NHEJ, we treated all its four sub-categories, as described in the previous
sections, separately, when including bacteria at the genus level. A multiple sequence alignment (MSA)

was built using FAMSA 1.1 (Deorowicz, Debudaj-Grabysz, and Gudyś 2016) with default options.
The conserved regions relevant for phylogenetic inference were extracted from the MSA using BMGE
v1.12 (Criscuolo and Gribaldo 2010). After the manual detection of the alignment, one spurious
sequence was removed and the MSA was built again for 969 bacteria (Supplementary table 2). Using
IQTREE v1.6.5 (Nguyen et al. 2015), a maximum likelihood based phylogenetic tree was built with the
best model chosen as SYM+R10 (LogL= -118152.5876, BIC= 249946.0604). ModelFinder (-m MF
option) (Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017) was used to choose the best model for the tree construction
compared against 285 other models . Branch supports were assessed using both 1000 ultrafast bootstrap
approximations ( -bb 1000 -bnni option) (Hoang et al. 2018) and SH-like approximate likelihood ratio
test (-alrt 1000 option) (Guindon et al. 2010).
A similar approach was used to build a phylogeny of 1403 (Supplementary table 3) organisms, nonredundant at the species level, comprising of just two NHEJ states- 1) No NHEJ and 2) conventional
NHEJ.

NHEJ ancestral state reconstruction analysis
To trace the evolutionary history, four discrete character states were defined as follows – Ku only,
LigD only, NHEJ- and NHEJ+. States were estimated at each node using stochastic character mapping
(Bollback 2006) with 1000 simulations provided as make.simmap() in the R package phytools v0.6-44
(Revell 2012). The phylogenetic tree was rooted using the midpoint method and polytomies were
removed by assigning very small branch lengths (10 -6) to all the branches with zero length. The prior
distribution of the states were estimated at the root of the tree. Further, by default the method assumes
that the transitions between different character states occur at equal rates. This might not always be
true, especially with complex traits where it is supposedly easier to lose than gain such characters.
Therefore, for the estimation of transition matrix Q, three discrete character evolution model fits were
compared – Equal Rates (ER), Symmetric (SYM) and All Rates Different (ARD). This allowed for
models that incorporate asymmetries in transition rates. Based on AIC weights, ARD model (w-AIC ARD
=1, w-AICSYM= 0, w-AICER= 0) was chosen as the best fit with unequal forward and backward rates for
each character state transition. Finally, Q was sampled 1000 times from the posterior probability
distribution of Q using MCMC and 1000 stochastic maps were simulated conditioned on each sampled
value of Q. This strategy was used to reconstruct ancestral states for both phylogenies comprising of
969 and 1403 organisms as described in the previous sections.

Ancestral states for the continuous trait genome size were reconstructed using fastAnc() employed in
phytools v0.6-44 based on the brownian motion model. This model was found to be the better fit model
as compared to multiple rate model (BPIC brownian<BPICstable and PSRF approaching <1.1 well within
1000000 iterations), assessed using StableTraits (Elliot and Mooers 2014). The multiple rate model
allows for the incorporation of neutrality and gradualism associated with Brownian motion and also
includes occasional bursts of rapid evolutionary change. Ancestral states for growth rate were
reconstructed by converting it into a binary trait. An organism was said to be slow growing if it
encoded rRNA copy numbers less than or equal to the median rRNA copy number (median =3) and
fast growing otherwise. The reconstruction was carried out using the same approach that was used for
estimating NHEJ ancestral states, as described in the previous paragraph.

NHEJ and genome characteristics phylogenetic comparative analysis
The two genome characteristics – genome size and growth rate – were compared across bacteria with
different NHEJ states. The distributions across bacteria with different NHEJ states were first compared
assuming statistical independence of bacteria, using Wilcoxon Rank sum test, wilcox.test() in R. Next,
two measures of phylogenetic signal – Pagel’s λ (Freckleton, Harvey, and Pagel 2002) and Blomberg’s
K (Blomberg, Garland, and Ives 2003) – were used for detecting the impact of shared ancestry, for
genome size and growth rate across bacteria, using the phylosig() routine in phytools R package
(Revell 2012). A phylogenetic ANOVA, employed in phytools R package v0.6-44 (Revell 2012), was
carried out with 1000 simulations and Holm-Bonferonni correction to control for family-wise error
rate, based on a method by Garland T. (Garland et al. 1993), to compare the genome characteristics in a
phylogenetically controlled manner. Please note that we log 10 transformed genome sizes and rRNA
copy number for all the analysis.

Correlated evolution analysis
Two relationships – (NHEJ repair and genome size) and (NHEJ repair and growth rate) - were
quantified using a statistical framework. To test if changes in genome characteristics occur
independently of NHEJ or are these changes more (or less) likely to occur in lineages with (or without)
NHEJ , we considered two models of evolution- independent and dependent. In the independent model,
both the traits were allowed to evolve separately on a phylogenetic tree i.e non-correlated evolution. In
the dependent model, the two traits were evolved in a non-agnostic manner i.e correlated evolution.
The NHEJ repair trait had two character states – no NHEJ repair (0) and conventional NHEJ repair (1).

Genome sizes, a continuous trait, were converted into binary state as well. For this, we computed the
mean genome size of organisms with 0 or 1 NHEJ repair state, and assigned a “lower” state (0) if a
value was less than the mean and a “higher” state (1) if the value was more. The same approach was
used to convert growth rates (rRNA copy number) into a binary state.
A continuous-time Markov model approach was used to investigate correlated evolution between
NHEJ repair and the genome characteristics. First, we used the maximum likelihood (ML) approach
(Pagel 1994) to calculate log-likelihoods for the two models of evolution per trait pair – 1) NHEJ repair
and genome size; 2) NHEJ repair and growth rate. A likelihood ratio statistic (LR) was calculated for
both comparisons, followed by a Chi-square test to assess if dependent model was a better fit. The
degrees of freedom are given by: dfChi-square

test

= ( nrate-dependent

model

– nrate-independent

model

). There are 8

transition rates in the dependent model across four states (00,01,10,11) and four transition rates in the
independent model across two states (0,1; 0,1). Therefore, the test was run with four degrees of
freedom.
The ML approach implicitly assumes that the models used for hypothesis testing are free of errors.
Therefore, to make our analysis robust, we used the bayesian rjmcmc (reverse jump markov chain
monte carlo) approach to calculate the marginal log-likelihoods of the independent and dependent
models of evolution (Pagel and Meade 2006). This approach takes into consideration the uncertainty
and minimizes the error associated in calculating the parameters used in each of our model(s), ensuring
reliable interpretations. log Bayes factor was used to assess the better fit out of the two models.
BayesTraits v3 (Pagel and Meade 2006) was used to carry out both ML and bayesian rjmcmc based
correlated evolution analysis as described above for both the models. ML was run using the default
parameters. Bayesian rjmcmc was run for 5050000 iterations, sampling every 1000th iteration with a
burn-in of 50000. For the estimation of marginal likelihood, stepping stone sampler algorithm was used
where the number of stones were set to 100 and each stone was allowed to run for 10000 iterations.

Phylogenetic logistic regression analysis
A method developed by Ives and Garland (Ives and Garland 2010), was used to carry out the
phylogenetic logistic regression analysis provided in the R package phylolm v2.6 (Tung Ho and Ané
2014)

as the subroutine phyloglm() with method=logistic_IG10. NHEJ repair was the binary

dependent variable with two states - no NHEJ (0) and conventional NHEJ repair (1). The two
independent continuous variables were genome size (GS) and growth rate (GR). We tested for three

To identify NHEJ machinery across bacteria, we used the reference sequences of the Ku domain, and
the LIG, POL and PE domains of LigD from P. aeruginosa to search ~6,000 complete bacterial
genomes for homologs (see Methods). We defined bacteria encoding Ku and the complete, threedomain version of LigD as those harbouring a conventional NHEJ system. Organisms lacking the POL

and LigD domains across these organisms, but a large majority (920) carried the conventional NHEJ.
75% bacteria harbouring conventional NHEJ coded for Ku and LigD in a 10kb vicinity of each other,
with 60% organisms carrying Ku and LigD in an operon. Most bacteria (84%) harbouring NHEJ coded
for a single copy of Ku, whereas the remaining coded 2-8 Ku copies in their genomes. About twothirds of NHEJ positive bacteria carried multiple copies of the LIG domain, 37% carried multiple
copies of the POL domain and 8% bacteria had multiple copies of the PE domain (Supplementary table

and not Ku. (Figure 1; Supplementary table 1).

Figure 4: NHEJ was gained and lost multiple times through evolution. A trace of the evolutionary history of
the two-component NHEJ system across bacteria. The tip and node labels are coloured according to the
NHEJ states: Red – NHEJ- ; Yellow – Ku-only ; Green – LigD-only ; Blue – NHEJ+ (Conventional and Nonconventional). NHEJ state for nodes is shown only when the posterior probability support is greater than
70%; interpreted as change in NHEJ state at that node as compared to shallower phylogenetic depths. Major
primary sequential NHEJ gains occured in Bacteroidetes and sub-clades in Proteobacteria. There was a
direct primary gain at actinobacteria at a relatively shallow depth (posterior probability > 0.7), however, it
should be noted that a node before the direct gain, supports the acquisition via LigD if cut-offs are relaxed
(posterior probability > 0.5). Major direct primary gains occured at the ancestral nodes of Firmicutes,
Acidobacteria and different sub-clades in Proteobacteria.

NHEJ was gained and lost multiple times through evolution
We traced the number of NHEJ gains and losses starting from the eubacterial ancestor to the species at
the tips of the 16S-based bacterial phylogenetic tree. To trace the evolutionary history we defined four
discrete character states – Ku only, LigD only (conventional and non-conventional), NHEJ- and
NHEJ+. Note that an NHEJ+ state is defined only when both Ku and LigD are present in a bacterium.
We calculated the posterior probabilities (pp) of each character state per node on the phylogeny, the
distribution of the number of times each of the 12 character state transitions occurred (Figure 3A) and
the distribution of the total time spent in each state (Figure S1). We performed this analysis for a set of
969 genomes in which each genus was represented once for each state (see Methods).

We first asked if NHEJ was present in the common eubacterial ancestor and, given the sporadicity of
NHEJ, subsequently lost in several lineages (Supplementary table 5). We assigned a major primary
gain to an internal ancestral node if (a) all nodes leading to it from the root had NHEJ- state; (b) the pp
of either NHEJ+, LigD only or Ku only at that ancestral node was >=0.7; (c) a gain of LigD only or Ku
only was followed by a transition to NHEJ+ and; (d) if it had at least three descendent species. We
observed multiple major independent primary gains at ancestral nodes within Bacteroidetes,
Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria and multiple sub-clades of Proteobacteria (Supplementary
table 5). It follows that the common eubacterial ancestor likely did not have NHEJ (Figure 4).
The gain of NHEJ can be sequential, gaining either Ku only or LigD only followed by the gain of the
other component; or it can be a one-step acquisition of both components (Figure 3B). The most
common transition from an NHEJ- state was to a LigD only state, followed by that to a NHEJ+ state.
Transition from NHEJ- to Ku only was negligible. In the reverse direction, a one-step loss of both Ku
and LigD is the most likely. However, Ku only state is rare.
A one-step transition from NHEJ- to NHEJ+ is likely through horizontal gene transfer. 60 bacterial
genomes belonging to the phyla Alpha (in particular the Rhizobiales) - and Beta-proteobacteria, and
Streptomycetales carried their NHEJ components on plasmids (Supplementary table1). However, based
on abnormal word usage statistics (see Methods), we couldn’t find NHEJ to be a part of the
horizontally acquired component of the chromosomes of any bacterial genome. At least two NHEJ- to
NHEJ+ transitions occurred close to the root, and it is possible that the predictions of horizontally
acquired NHEJ systems may be an underestimate (Figure 4).
In summary, (a) the common eubacterial ancestor was devoid of NHEJ; (b) NHEJ was gained and lost
multiple times; (c) transitions to a Ku only state are rare.

NHEJ occurrence is associated with genome size, growth rate and G-C content
Recently, Ku-encoding organisms were shown to have higher genomic G+C content (Weissman,
Fagan, and Johnson 2019). Given its central role in DNA repair, we asked whether any other genome
characteristics could also be associated with the presence or absence of NHEJ. First, we verified that
the findings of Weissman et al. held true for NHEJ+ states as defined in our study (Figure 5A,
Supplementary S4-S5, S7C) (Weissman, Fagan, and Johnson 2019). Along with this, we tested two
additional characteristics: genome size and growth rate (as measured by the copy number of rRNA
operons), both of which could determine the availability or the lack of a homologous template for high

bacteria as a proxy for repair proficiency, and compared them to NHEJ- genomes. Data including nonconventional NHEJ are shown in Supplementary Figures S2 and S3.
Bacteria with NHEJ were found to have larger genomes (median = 5.4 Mb) than those without NHEJ
(Median= 2.9 Mb; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < 10 -15; Figure 5B, S7A), and significantly larger than
that expected by a random distribution in which the probability of having NHEJ is linearly proportional
to genome size (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P < 10 -15, across 100 simulations; Figure 5D). This
relationship was found to be true within the phylum Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and
Firmicutes as well (Supplementary figure S6).
In addition, bacteria harbouring NHEJ were found to have significantly fewer rRNA copies (median =
3), and by inference slower growth rates, than bacteria without NHEJ (median = 4; Wilcoxon rank-sum

test; P < 10-15; Figure 5C). While the distribution of rRNA copy numbers for genomes without NHEJ
was broad, those with conventional NHEJ fell within a narrow range, representing relatively slower
growth (Supplementary figure S7B). At the phyla level, this relationship was found to hold true for
Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, whereas there was no significant difference for Bacteroidetes and
Firmicutes respectively (Supplementary figure S8).
In order to confirm the result in a phylogenetically controlled manner, Pagel’s λ and Blomberg’s K
were used to first measure whether closely related bacteria tended to have similar genome sizes and
growth rates in the dataset (see Methods). These measures suggest that phylogenetic coherence is
significantly greater than random expectations for both the genome characteristics (Supplementary
Table 6). Therefore, the distributions of genome size between bacteria with different NHEJ status were
compared while accounting for the statistical non-independence of closely related taxa (see Methods).
We found a significant difference in log10(genome sizes) between bacteria with conventional NHEJ and

without the repair (phyloANOVA; P = 6 x 10 -3); the characters being mapped on the phylogenetic tree
of 969 bacteria with five discrete groups – NHEJ-, Ku only, LigD-only, conventional NHEJ and nonconventional NHEJ. However, we did not observe a significant difference in log 10 (rRNA copy
number) between the two groups of bacteria (phyloANOVA; P = 1; See Discussion).
We used maximum likelihood as well as Bayesian approaches to test if the observed associations of
conventional NHEJ individually with large genomes and slow growth rates is indicative of dependent
or independent evolution of these traits on the phylogenetic tree (see Methods). Both suggested that the
phylogenetic data fit models of evolution in which conventional NHEJ presence or absence and
genome size or growth rate are evolving in a correlated manner (Table 1). This strengthens the
association between the tested variables in a phylogenetically controlled way. Phylogenetic logistic
regression of the conventional NHEJ occurrence with both the continuous independent variables
showed, however, that genome size is the stronger correlate (see Methods; Table 2)
As a case study where the association of both genome size and growth rate with NHEJ evolution was
prominent, we found a gain of conventional NHEJ in the ancestor of two genera belonging to
Corynebacteriales – Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium – where the former retained and the latter
had a secondary loss of the machinery. Phylogenetic ancestral reconstruction analysis revealed an
increase in genome size in the ancestor of Corynebacteriales, followed by an NHEJ gain. While
Mycobacterium retained NHEJ, Corynebacterium lost the machinery along with a decrease in genome
size. Using a similar analysis, growth rate mapped to this sub-clade revealed an increase in rRNA copy
number in Corynebacterium. (Figure S9; see methods)

Discussion
Taking advantage of the availability of a large number of genomes, we confirm the non-ubiquitous
nature of NHEJ across the bacterial domain with 22% bacteria coding for it. At the taxa level, while
some phyla retain this sporadicity, others are devoid of an NHEJ repair. A trace of the evolutionary
history suggested that NHEJ was most likely absent in the eubacterial ancestor. It was instead gained
independently multiple times in different bacterial lineages. However, these primary gains were not
sufficient to stabilize the repair states in sub-clades, since a large number of secondary losses and gains
were observed across the phylogeny.
Our analysis suggests that there are two common methods to arrive at an NHEJ+ state- a) the most

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/869602; this version posted December 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

common way to gain NHEJ was by the acquisition of LigD followed by Ku and b) a direct transition
from an NHEJ- to NHEJ+ state. We found that the LigD only state is more prevalent and is a
prominent intermediate in the evolution of the NHEJ+ state in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes
(ppProteobacterial-subclade=0.875 and ppBacteroidetes=0.7; Figure S10C and S10D). However, 90% of LigD only
genomes did not encode POL and PE domains, raising the possibility that LigD only to NHEJ+
transitions could actually be NHEJ- to NHEJ+ transitions.
Direct NHEJ gain can be explained by their acquisition via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In this
direction, we observed 60 NHEJ+ organisms coding this repair on their plasmids. However, our
analysis based on the detection of base compositional differences revealed no horizontally acquired
chromosomal NHEJ. These numbers may be an underestimate because one is unlikely to pick HGT
events if – (a) the regions getting horizontally transferred have the same compositional biases in the
donor and the recipient cells and/or (b) such HGT events occur early in bacterial evolution. Two
instances of the latter case that we observe in our analysis are direct primary gains of NHEJ at the
ancestral nodes of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, with high posterior probability support
(ppFirmicutes=0.987 and ppActinobacteria = 0.967; Figure S10A and S10B).
A third route to an NHEJ+ state could have been via a Ku only state. However, we observed that the
time spent in a Ku only state is the least and NHEJ gains via this route are rare. Approximately 90% Ku
only states are present in Firmicutes alone, specifically belonging to two genera, Bacillus and
Fictibacillus. This suggests that Ku only state is largely avoided across most bacteria. This could be
because Ku alone is non-functional in repair or in some cases could even block the access of break ends
for recombination-based repair (Sinha et al. 2009; Gupta et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012). In 138
organisms, where Ku is retained in the absence of LigD, it’s function could be mediated by cross-talk
with other ligases such as LigA. Consistent with this, it has been previously shown that if damage
produces 3’ overhangs specifically, LigA could repair the lesion even in the absence of LigB/C/D
(Aniukwu, Glickman, and Shuman 2008).
To understand the selection pressures that might play a role in shaping the evolutionary pattern of
NHEJ, we studied the genome characteristics associated with this DNA repair. Under the event of a
DSB, the unavailability of a template would prevent the highly accurate homologous recombination
repair to act. Therefore, one might expect a higher selection pressure of maintaining NHEJ in bacteria
with larger genome sizes and slower growth rates. In line with our hypothesis, we found that the
organisms possessing conventional NHEJ tend to have significantly larger genome size and slower

growth rate as compared to those that are devoid of it. A phylogenetically controlled test suggested that
this association held true for genome size and not growth rate. We note that phyloANOVA used here
for hypothesis testing assumes normality. However, our data for genome size and rRNA copy number
are not normally distributed, even after converting them into a logarithmic scale (Shapiro-Wilk
normality test; Pgenome size =1.7 x 10-10, PrRNA copy number < 10-15). Therefore, the result should be interpreted
keeping this caveat in mind. Furthermore, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inferences showed that
there is a correlated evolution of NHEJ with genome size and growth rate along the phylogenetic tree.
Considering the two variables together, we found that genome size is the better correlate of the NHEJ+
state. Therefore, we conclude that the NHEJ+ state is strongly associated with genome size and to a
much smaller extent with growth rate throughout its evolution.
Our study highlights the evolutionary trajectory of NHEJ and central characteristics that may have
determined it’s sporadic distribution. DSB repair, including NHEJ, has been implicated in shaping
bacterial genomes through mutagenesis (Paris et al. 2015), HGT (Popa et al. 2011) and their effect on
genomic GC content (Weissman, Fagan, and Johnson 2019). Given this relationship between repair and
genome evolution, it is important to ask how one factor may have influenced the other during bacterial
evolution. It is also possible that similar forces have played a role in the evolution of other repair
pathways and the genomes encoding them.
