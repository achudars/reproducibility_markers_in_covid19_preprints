Abstract

28

Upon detection of viral infections, cells activate the expression of type I interferons

29

(IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines to control viral dissemination. As part of their

30

antiviral response, cells also trigger the translational shutoff response which prevents

31

translation of viral mRNAs and cellular mRNAs in a non-selective manner.

32

Intriguingly, mRNAs encoding for antiviral factors bypass this translational shutoff,

33

suggesting the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms enabling expression of the

34

self-defence genes. Here, we identified the dsRNA binding protein ILF3 as an essential

35

host factor required for efficient translation of the central antiviral cytokine, IFNB1,

36

and a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. By combining polysome profiling and next-

37

generation sequencing, ILF3 was also found to be necessary to establish the dsRNA-

38

induced transcriptional and translational programs. We propose a central role for the

39

host factor ILF3 in enhancing expression of the antiviral defence mRNAs in cellular

40

conditions where cap-dependent translation is compromised.

Introduction

50

The presence of virus-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cytoplasm of infected

51

cells is a hallmark of active viral replication. Mammals have developed several sensors,

52

known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), capable of recognising these virus-derived

53

pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). For instance, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs),

54

with MDA5 and RIG-I as central members of the family, sense dsRNA and signal through

55

the mitochondrial associated antiviral factor, MAVS to induce the expression of type I

56

interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines (reviewed in (1)). Secreted type I IFNs

57

bind the cell surface receptor IFNAR on infected and neighbouring cells to activate a second

58

transcriptional response of approximately 500 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are

59

responsible for establishing an antiviral state and preventing viral replication and

60

dissemination (2)(3).

61

Virus-derived dsRNA also activates the cytoplasmic kinase PKR, which phosphorylates the

62

initiation factor of translation eIF2α, resulting in a non-selective translational arrest of viral

63

and cellular mRNAs also known as the host translational shutoff (4)(5)(6)(7). Regulation of

64

eIF2α activity by phosphorylation provides a fast-acting mechanism to control protein

65

expression in response to other stimuli, including amino acid starvation or endoplasmic

66

reticulum stress (8)(9)(10). In addition to phosphorylating eIF2α and inducing the

67

translational shutoff response, PKR can also phosphorylate the two major alternatively

68

spliced isoforms encoded by the ILF3 gene, known as NF90 and NF110 (11)(12)(13).

69

NF90/110 are involved in regulating different steps of gene expression, including pre-mRNA

70

splicing, miRNA biogenesis, and mRNA stability amongst others, and in controlling the life

71

cycle of several viruses (reviewed in (14)(15)). Both ILF3 isoforms bind RNA through two

72

tandem dsRNA-binding motifs and an RGG-rich domain (16)(17). In agreement with their

73

association with polyribosomes, these factors can negatively regulate the translation of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/809608; this version posted October 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

74

cellular mRNAs, and in particular, mRNAs containing AU-rich motifs (18)(19). In the

75

context of viral infections, the current model suggests that NF90 and NF110 work in a

76

complex with NF45 (20)(21)(22), and upon PKR-mediated phosphorylation, dissociate from

77

NF45 and are retained on ribosomes to prevent translation of viral mRNAs (13). However,

78

the translational targets of ILF3 during homeostasis or the antiviral response remain

79

unknown. ILF3 isoforms have also been implicated in promoting the formation of stress

80

granules during the antiviral response (23)(24), as well as being required for successful

81

biogenesis of circular RNAs, a function that is impaired by activation of the antiviral

82

response by the viral dsRNA mimic, poly (I:C) (25). However, the function of ILF3 during

83

activation and establishment of the type I IFN response has not been characterized.

84

Besides the classical sensors of viral-derived dsRNA, other cellular dsRNA binding proteins

85

are involved in limiting viral replication. Both dsRNA binding proteins TRBP and PACT

86

regulate PKR activity and consequently the host-translational shutoff (26)(27). The

87

OAS/RNase L system binds dsRNA and induces cleavage and degradation of RNA to limit

88

viral replication, and participates in the translational shut off response by promoting turnover

89

of the host mRNAs (28)(29)(30). In addition to their role as direct antiviral factors, the

90

dsRNA binding proteins DICER, DGCR8 and DROSHA have shown to be essential to

91

control the antiviral response (31)(32)(33)(34). Considering that both NF90 and NF110 can

92

also bind dsRNA, and their previously reported role as direct antiviral factors by interfering

93

with the function of viral-encoded proteins and viral RNAs, here we characterized the role of

94

NF90/NF110 in regulating the activation of the IFN pathway by dsRNA stimulation and in

95

the establishment of the host translational shutoff. By combining polysome profiling and

96

high-throughput RNA sequencing analyses, we uncovered a role for NF90/NF110 in

97

establishing the gene expression profile associated with the activation of the dsRNA-

98

mediated type I IFN response, at the transcriptional and translational level. Specifically, the

99

NF110 isoform was found to be essential for efficient translation of IFNB1 mRNA, the

100

central cytokine of the antiviral response, and a subset of ISGs in an environment where cap-

101

dependent translation is compromised. In agreement, in the absence of NF90/NF110, cells

102

displayed impaired antiviral activity, which correlated with attenuated production of ISGs.

103

We propose a role for ILF3 in enhancing translation of IFNB1 and ISGs during the host

104

translational shutoff response, thereby providing effective levels of these antiviral proteins

105

and ensuring a competent type I IFN response.

Material and methods

107

Cell lines, transfections, poly(I:C) and IFN-β stimulation

108

HeLa and A549 cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal

109

calf serum (FCS) and 1% Penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2. Transfections of

110

poly(I:C) (2 μg/mL, HMW, tlrl-pic; Invivogen) were performed using Lipofectamine 2000

111

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Four hours post transfection, cells were

112

collected for downstream applications. For IFN-β stimulation, HeLa cells were treated with

113

100U of recombinant human IFN-β (Peprotech, 300-02BC) for 4 hrs and harvested. Knock-

114

down experiments were performed by two consecutive rounds of transfection with siRNA

115

pools against ILF3 (L-012442-00-0005, Dharmacon) or EIF2AK2 (L-003527-00-0005,

116

Dharmacon) in HeLa or A549s. As a negative control, a non-targeting siRNA pool was used

117

(D-001810-10-05, Dharmacon). Individual siRNAs against both major ILF3 isoforms were

118

adapted from Guan et al., 2008 (35). For NF110 (Sense-CUACGAGAGCAAAUUCAA

123

cells were split and transfected with a second round of siRNAs. Cells were collected for

124

downstream processing 72 hours after the first transfection.

125

RNA extraction and RT/qRT-PCR analyses

126

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol and reverse transcribed (RT) using MMLV (Promega)

127

or Transcriptor Universal cDNA master (Roche) using random hexamers or oligo-dT and

128

analysed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in a Roche Lightcycler 480 II system. For

129

oligonucleotides sequences see Supplementary Table 1. Analyses (2-ΔCt) were performed

130

by normalization against RN7SK or 18S rRNA levels.

131

Cell lysis and Western blotting

132

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Na-

133

deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail

134

(Roche), 5mM NaF and 0.2 mM Sodium orthovanadate. Protein lysates were mixed with

135

reducing agent and LDS sample buffer (Novex, ThermoFisher) and denatured at 70 °C for 10

136

min and loaded in Novex Nupage 4-12% Bis-Tris gels. Gels were transferred onto

137

nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot2 system (ThermoFisher). Membranes were blocked

138

with PBS-0.05% Tween and 5% milk for 1 hour at room temperature with agitation, before

147

ELISA, IFN bioactivity and Virus protection assay (TCID50)

148

A549 and HeLa cells were depleted of ILF3 and poly(I:C) stimulated as described above.

149

Conditioned medium was harvested after 4 hr of poly(I:C) stimulation for HeLa cells and 6 hr

150

in A549 to quantify IFN-β production by ELISA using the Quantikine human IFN-β ELISA

151

kit (R&D systems, DIFNB0) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Data were collected

152

using a Varioskan Flash plate reader. For viral protection assays, A549 were transfected with

153

either mock (non-targeting siRNA) or siRNAs against ILF3 for 72 hours, prior to poly(I:C)

154

transfection (2 μg/mL). Next, medium was collected, centrifuged for 3 minutes at 500xg, and

155

filtered using a 0.22 μm filter. For ISG induction analyses, A549 cells were seeded and

156

treated with a 1:2 dilution of conditioned medium for 4 hr and harvested for qRT-PCR

157

analyses. For the 50% Tissue Culture Infective dose (TCID50) assays, A549 cells were seeded

158

into 96 well plates and treated for 4 hr with the following conditioned medium dilutions: 1:2,

159

1:10, 1:50, 1:100 and 1:250. Next, cells were infected with eight serial dilutions of Echovirus

160

7, with at least 6 wells per dilution and incubated for at least 24 hours before counting

161

infected wells. TCID50 values were calculated using the Spearman and Kärber algorithm, as

162

in Witteveldt et al., 2019 (34). As a control, IFN-β signalling was blocked with 1.5 µg/mL of

163

neutralizing antibodies against IFNAR1 for 2 hours prior to the conditioned media treatment,

164

as previously described in Szabo et al., (36).

Gradient buffer solution (0.3 M NaCl, 150 mM MgCL2, 15 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5, 2 mM

167

DTT and 0.1 mg/mL cyclohexamide) containing different sucrose concentrations was layered

168

in Beckman Coulter 14 mL polypropylene ultracentrifuge tubes. 0.5 mL of 60% sucrose

169

followed by 1.6 mL of each, 50%, 42%, 34%, 26%, 18% and 10% sucrose solutions were

170

poured followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen after every layer. Gradients were stored

171

at -80°C until use and defrosted overnight at 4°C to allow them to equilibrate. For polysome

172

gradient fractionation, one 10 cm plate of HeLa cells at 80 % confluency was used. Fresh

173

medium was added to cells for 1 hr prior harvesting to ensure active protein synthesis. Next,

174

50 ng/mL cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma) was added to the medium and incubated for further

175

30 minutes at 37°C, before transferring to ice, where cells were washed twice with 2 mL ice-

176

cold PBS containing 50 ng/mL CHX. To harvest, cells were scraped into 2 ml ice-cold PBS

177

containing 50 ng/mL CHX and pelleted by centrifugation at 1400 rpm (300 x g) at 4 °C for 5

178

minutes. The supernatant was removed and 0.5 ml ice-cold lysis buffer (Gradient Buffer; 1%

179

Triton X 100) was added, lysates were passed several times through a 25G needle and

180

incubated on ice for 10 min. Lysates were then transferred to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and

181

centrifuged at maximum speed (20,000 x g) for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatant was next

182

carefully layered onto a sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 256,000 x g (38,000 rpm) for 1

183

hr 50 min at 4°C in a SW40 rotor in a Beckman L60 Ultracentrifuge. Ten 1 mL fractions

184

were collected using a fraction collector (FoxyR1) monitoring optical density (Teledyne

185

ISCO UA-6 detector with Optical unit 11). Constant flow rate was achieved using a pump

186

syringe (Brandel) and Fluorinert FC770 (Flourinert). Optical absorbance of the solution was

187

read at 254 nM and recorded directly using PeakTrak software V. 1.1. For protein extraction,

188

20% (v/v) final of cold TCA was added to each fraction and incubated on ice for 10 min prior

189

centrifugation (20,000 x g for 5 min at 4 C). The pellet was washed twice in 1 ml acetone (-

190

20°C) followed by centrifugation. After the last acetone wash, the pellet was air-dried and

191

dissolved in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to be loaded in SDS-PAGE gels and western blot

192

analyses. For RNA analyses, RNA was either extracted from each individual fraction or

193

pooled into subpolysomal or polysomal pools. For this, three volumes of absolute ethanol

194

were added to each fraction along with 0.1% SDS and precipitated overnight at -20°C.

195

Samples were centrifuged at 5000 x g for 50 min at 4°C, and pellets resuspended in 50 μL

196

water at 4°C with gentle agitation for an hour. Finally, Trizol LS was used to extract RNA,

197

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To disrupt polysomes by EDTA treatment, lysates

198

were pre-treated with EDTA (50 mM) before sucrose fractionation.

199

For high-throughput sequencing analyses, RNA was extracted from pooled polysomal

200

fractions (polysome profiling) or directly from cells (total RNA profiling). HeLa cells were

201

either ILF3-depleted by ILF3-targeting siRNAs or transfected with non-targeting siRNAs as

202

a control (siMock), followed by stimulation with poly(I:C). Experiments were performed in

203

three biological replicates. For total RNA profiling, library preparation and sequencing for

204

total RNA sequencing was carried out by BGI (Hong Kong). Briefly, total RNA was rRNA-

205

depleted using the Ribo-zero rRNA depletion kit (Illumina) and strand-specific libraries were

206

prepared using the Illumina Truseq protocol (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq

207

4000 generating 100 bp paired end reads. For polysome profiling, library preparation and

208

sequencing were carried out by Novogene (Hong Kong). Libraries were enriched for mRNAs

209

using polyA + selection and non-strand-specific libraries prepared using the Illumina Trueseq

210

protocol (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 generating 150bp single end

211

reads.

212

Bioinformatic analyses

213

Total and polysome associated RNA-sequencing datasets were processed with the following

214

RNA-seq pipeline; quantification of transcript and gene level abundances per sample were

215

performed with Salmon v0.9.1 (parameters: --seqBias -g) (37) over the Gencode v24

216

reference human transcriptome (38). Estimated counts were retrieved as input for differential

217

expression analyses. Only protein coding genes were considered in the case of polysomal

218

samples. Statistical inference of regulated genes between each pair of conditions were

normalization (TMM) and the generalized linear model (GLM). Differentially regulated

221

genes were examined with an FDR cut-off of 0.05 obtained with the Benjamini & Hochberg

222

correction. MA-plots, heatmaps, boxplots were generated using gplots, pheatmap and the

223

viridis R libraries. Overlapped MA-plot representations (Figure 1B, 4A and 4D) were

224

obtained using sliding bins along the complete range of the average expression logCPM (size

225

= 1.5, step=0.5), quartiles and median were retrieved in bins with more than 25 genes. The

226

average expression for each gene was calculated using the logCPMs obtained in each of the

227

conditions compared.

228

For GC-content analyses, the longest isoform annotated for each protein coding gene was

229

retrieved (Gencode v24, (38)). Genic regions were obtained according to the annotations and

230

the following nucleotide contents calculated: GC-content (S/W), R/Y, A/T and G/C. To

231

define the subset of GC or AT-richness, groups were chosen after splitting by the median of

232

the total protein coding genes.

233

The list of ISGs was generated from the significantly upregulated genes in our total RNA-seq

ILF3 depletion affects expression of the antiviral type I IFN program

250

During homeostasis, ILF3 has been involved in most steps of the gene expression pathway,

251

from transcription to translation, including splicing, RNA stability and export (14). However,

252

the role of ILF3 during cellular stress, such as the antiviral IFN response, is still unknown. To

253

elucidate the function of ILF3 during the antiviral response, total gene expression analyses by

254

RNA-sequencing were performed during ILF3 depletion in conditions of type I IFN

255

activation (Supplementary Figure 1A). For this purpose, HeLa cells were depleted of ILF3

256

with siRNAs targeting both major isoforms, NF90 and NF110, and the type I IFN response

257

was induced by transfection of the dsRNA analogue, poly(I:C). This analogue activates the

258

expression of type I IFNs, but also induces translational shutoff by stimulation of PKR and

259

RNAse L activity. Analyses of total RNA sequencing of poly(I:C)-stimulated HeLa cells

260

confirmed the expression of the type I IFN IFNB1, but not IFNA, and induction of more than

261

300 classical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), as expected (Figure 1A and

262

Supplementary Excel File 2). KEGG and Reactome analyses for upregulated genes were

263

enriched for ‘Interferon alpha/beta signalling’ and ‘immune system’ categories, whereas

264

metabolic genes were represented in the group of downregulated genes during dsRNA

265

stimulation (Supplementary Figure 1B). The depletion of ILF3 significantly changed the

suggesting that most of the observed changes in gene expression upon activating the type I

268

IFN response were conserved in the absence of ILF3 (Supplementary Figure 2A ‘siILF3

269

p(I:C) vs siMock p(I:C)’ and ‘siILF3 p(I:C) vs siILF3’), for depletion levels see

270

Supplementary Figure 2B). During homeostasis, ILF3 depletion only caused a minor effect

271

on the steady-state levels of transcripts, as less than 1% of the analysed genes displayed

272

significant changes in their relative expression (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2C for a

273

complete list see Supplementary Excel File 2). A more detailed analysis of ILF3-dependent

274

changes in gene expression revealed differential behaviour depending on the average

275

expression of the genes (average expression is calculated using the logCPMs obtained for

276

each gene in the two conditions compared). Lowly expressed genes were upregulated during

277

dsRNA stimulation and were less increased in the absence of ILF3, whereas inhibited genes

278

were highly expressed and less downregulated in the absence of ILF3 (Figure 1B). Specific

279

analyses of annotated interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) upregulated after poly(I:C)

280

transfection revealed that ILF3 was necessary to stimulate their expression (Figure 1A and

281

1C). Other subgroups of genes, such as IRES and TOP (5'terminal oligopyrimidine motif)-

282

containing mRNAs were not negatively affected by ILF3 depletion, suggesting that the

283

positive effect of ILF3 on expression was ISG-specific (Figure 1C). TOP mRNAs are

284

enriched for genes encoding protein synthesis factors, such as ribosomal proteins, and their

285

translation is regulated during stress growth conditions by the mTOR pathway (46). On the

286

other hand, IRES-containing mRNAs bypass the need of 5'end cap structure to initiate

287

translation and directly recruit the ribosome internally to the mRNA (47). These results were

288

validated by qRT-PCR, confirming a reduction in the production of the ISGs, IFTI2, ISG15,

289

CCL5 and CXCL10 in the absence of ILF3 (Figure 1D). The expression levels of IFNB1

291

ISGs, remained unchanged in the absence of ILF3 (Figure 1D). These analyses suggest that

292

ILF3 is essential to induce a robust type I IFN gene expression program.

293

ILF3 associates with polysomes and regulates IFNB1 mRNA translation

294

While the levels of some ISGs were reduced in the absence of ILF3, the mRNA levels of

295

IFNB1, the major driver in inducing their expression, were unchanged. Considering the

296

previously reported role of ILF3 on mRNA translation (18) (19), we next aimed to study if

297

ILF3 could be regulating the translation of IFNB1 mRNA, and as consequence differential

298

ISG expression. To test this possibility, we assessed the rate of IFNB1 translation by

299

polysome profiling, in addition to measuring IFN-β protein levels by ELISA. First, co-

300

sedimentation of the different ILF3 isoforms with polysomes was characterized by sucrose

301

fractionation analyses of HeLa cytoplasmic extracts stimulated with or without poly(I:C).

302

During homeostasis, both major alternatively spliced isoforms of ILF3, NF90 and NF110,

303

were found to associate with polysomes (Figure 2A, fractions 6-9), as well as lighter

304

fractions, containing the 40S and 60S ribosomal particles (Figure 2A fractions 3-4,

305

respectively), and monosomes (80S) (Figure 2A, fraction 5, quantification in Figure 2B).

306

After stimulation with poly(I:C), a major drop in the levels of actively translating polysomes

307

was observed, as expected by the dsRNA-activated translational shutoff (Figure 2A, top right

308

panel). The translational shutdown was further confirmed by assessing the co-sedimentation

309

profiles of ribosomal markers. eIF6 serves as a marker for pre-ribosomal subunit 60S, which

310

dissociates from the nascent 60S particle when the mature 80S ribosome is formed (48). The

311

ribosomal protein S6 (S6RP) serves as a marker for the small 40S ribosomal subunit. In

312

poly(I:C)-stimulated conditions, S6RP no longer co-sedimented in the heavier polysomal

313

fractions, confirming successful activation of the translational shutoff response (Figure 2A,

314

bottom right panel). Under these conditions, NF110 isoform disengaged from heavier

315

polysomal fractions, accumulating in the lighter fractions (Figure 2A, quantification in

316

Figure 2B top panel), whereas NF90 profile remained similar when compared to non-

317

stimulated cells (Figure 2A, quantification in Figure 2B bottom panel).

318

Both NF90 and NF110 are known substrates of the kinase PKR, one of the essential factors

319

driving the translational shutoff during the dsRNA-mediated antiviral response (13). We

320

therefore measured ILF3 isoforms association with polysomes in the absence of PKR (Figure

321

2C). Interestingly, the NF110 isoform shifted to lighter molecular weight fractions in the

322

absence of PKR during homeostasis (Figure 2D left panel, compared to Figure 2A left

323

panel), suggesting that association of this isoform with polysomes depends on PKR.

324

Stimulation of PKR-depleted cells with poly(I:C) did not result in further changes in NF90

325

and NF110 sedimentation, when compared to non-stimulated PKR-depleted cells (Figure

326

2D), even though a less pronounced translational shutoff was observed, as evidenced by

327

residual S6RP co-fractionation with higher molecular weight fractions (compare Figure 2D

328

right panel with Figure 2A right panel). To confirm that ILF3 isoforms were indeed

329

associated with polysomes, cytoplasmic extracts pre-treated with EDTA were fractionated to

330

monitor NF90/NF110 sedimentation. EDTA treatment, which forces dissociation of

331

ribosomal subunits, resulted in both NF90 and NF110 disengaging from the polysomal

332

fractions (Figure 2E, from fraction 6 onwards). All these data support that NF90 and NF110

333

directly associate with actively translating ribosomes, and NF110 association with polysomes

334

is dependent on PKR.

335

Considering these results, we next aimed to determine if ILF3 could regulate IFNB1

336

translation. We performed polysomal fractionation and assessed IFNB1 mRNA association

337

with polysomes as an indirect measurement of its translation, in the presence or absence of

338

ILF3. We again confirmed that ILF3 depletion did not significantly affect the levels of IFNB1

339

mRNA induction (Figure 3A). In addition, we confirmed that depletion of NF90/NF110 did

340

not change the levels of eIF2α phosphorylation, but resulted in destabilization of NF45

341

(Figure 3B), as previously reported (35). We next studied the sedimentation of IFNB1

342

mRNA with polysomes in the presence or absence of ILF3 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on

343

each of the collected fractions, as in Figure 3C. Successful poly(I:C)-activated translational

344

shutoff was confirmed by the shift of FOS mRNA from heavier to lighter polysomal fractions

345

(Figure 3D, compare top left and right panels). Interestingly, the depletion of ILF3 affected

346

the distribution and association of IFNB1 mRNA with polysomes, suggesting that ILF3

347

regulates translation of this mRNA (Figure 3D, bottom gels). In addition, IFNB1 mRNA in

348

pooled subpolysomal and polysomal fractions was quantified by qRT-PCR and confirmed

349

that ILF3 depletion significantly decreased the co-sedimentation of IFNB1 mRNA with

350

polysomes, suggesting that ILF3 may indeed regulate IFN-β protein production (Figure 3E).

351

This was confirmed by quantifying IFN-β protein levels by ELISA in the supernatants of

352

both HeLa and A549 cells after stimulation with poly(I:C). ILF3 depleted cells showed a

353

significant decrease in IFN-β protein levels (Figure 3F).

354

As ILF3 encodes the two major isoforms NF90 and NF110 and only the NF110 association

355

with polysomes was affected during poly(I:C) stimulation, we next assessed if regulation of

356

IFNB1 mRNA association with polysomes is isoform specific. For this purpose, we designed

357

specific siRNAs targeting NF90 or NF110. Extracts depleted for these factors were

358

fractionated, and subpolysomal and polysomal fractions were pooled to quantify the IFNB1

359

mRNA in these two populations. Interestingly, the depletion of NF110, but not NF90, caused

360

a decrease in the association of IFNB1 mRNA with the polysomal fractions (Figure 3G-3I).

361

All these results suggest that translation of IFNB1 mRNA is enhanced by the NF110 isoform

362

of ILF3 after dsRNA stimulation.

363

ILF3 is necessary for the host translational shutoff and translation of ISGs

364

Considering the previously reported role of ILF3 in regulating translation during homeostasis

365

and its role in enhancing IFNB1 mRNA translation, we next wanted to characterize the

366

impact of ILF3 function in global translation during the type I IFN response. For this

367

purpose, mRNA was extracted in triplicates from pooled polysomal fractions from poly(I:C)

368

stimulated and unstimulated HeLa cells in the presence or absence of ILF3 and the

369

transcriptome was sequenced (Supplementary Figure 3A). After dsRNA stimulation, we

370

observed two populations of protein-coding mRNAs that were differentially affected by

371

ILF3. First, a population of low abundance transcripts that became more associated with

372

polysomes during dsRNA stimulation, and second, a highly expressed population that

373

became less associated (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure 3B, for complete list see

374

Supplementary Excel File 3). Interestingly, those mRNAs that were recruited to polysomes

375

during activation of the type I IFN response, which were mainly cytokines and ISGs, were

376

less engaged in the absence of ILF3 (Figure 4A, for KEGG analyses Supplementary Figure

377

4A). Conversely, highly associated mRNAs, which contain housekeeping genes and

378

ribosomal proteins, no longer dissociated from polysomes during poly(I:C) stimulation upon

379

ILF3 depletion (Figure 4A, for KEGG analyses Supplementary Figure 4B). To explore

380

these observations further, we analysed subgroups of protein-coding genes separately and

381

confirmed that ISGs were significantly less enriched in polysomes in the absence of ILF3,

382

whereas TOP mRNAs became more enriched, and IRES mRNAs remained similarly enriched

383

in polysomes upon ILF3 depletion (Figure 4B). There are several features in mRNAs that

384

dictate their translatability, for instance, the GC-content of an mRNA positively correlates

385

with efficient polysomal association (49). In agreement with this, we observed that GC-rich

386

genes were also more associated with polysomes upon dsRNA stimulation, whereas AT-rich

387

genes were disengaged, and this effect was attenuated upon ILF3 depletion (Figure 4C). A

388

more refined analysis, considering the average expression of these genes, revealed that ILF3

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/809608; this version posted October 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

389

depletion reverted some of these observations. Highly expressed AT-rich genes were no

390

longer disengaged from polysomes, and low and medium-expressed GC-rich genes were less

391

efficiently associated with polysomes (Figure 4D). Importantly, ISGs have a heterogeneous

392

GC-content distribution, suggesting that the differential association of these genes with

393

polysomes cannot be directly attributed to the GC-content effect revealed by our analyses.

394

Our data suggest that the ISGs and TOP mRNAs subgroups display opposite behaviours in

395

polysomal association upon ILF3 depletion. ISGs association with polysomes was affected by

396

the absence of ILF3 (Figure 5A), whereas TOP mRNAs, which are disengaged from

397

polysomes upon activating the host translational shutoff, reverted to almost homeostatic

398

levels in the absence of ILF3 (Figure 5B). qRT-PCR analyses of pooled subpolysomal and

399

polysomal fractions confirmed that ILF3 depletion led to a significant reduction in polysome

400

association for the ISGs IFIT3, CCL5, IFIT2, ISG15, CXCL10 and DDX58, supporting a

401

positive role of ILF3 in ISGs translation (Figure 5C). At the protein level, we confirmed that

402

in the absence of ILF3, ISGs such as IFIT3, OASL and IRF1 were less induced (Figure 5D).

403

The opposite effect was confirmed for the TOP mRNA, EIF3M. Polysomal association of

404

EIF3M was lost during dsRNA stimulation, and this effect was reversed by depletion of

405

ILF3, as a control ACTB association was quantified (Supplementary Figure 5A and 5B).

406

However, no changes in eIF3M protein levels were observed, which may be due to the its

407

high stability, and the brief time of stimulation with poly (I:C) (Supplementary Figure 5A).

408

To further elucidate the function of ILF3 on ISGs mRNA translation, we assessed if

409

differential ISG polysomal association could be directly attributed to ILF3 presence or be a

410

secondary consequence of lowered IFN-β production and ISG expression. To this end,

411

polysome profiles of cells depleted or not of ILF3 and stimulated with recominant IFN-β

412

were compared. A proportion of the tested ISGs (IFIT3, IFIT2 and ISG15) followed the same

413

behaviour as seen after poly(I:C) stimulation, suggesting that the differential polysomal

414

association of these ISGs were due to direct ILF3 action (Supplementary Figure 6).

415

All these data suggest that ILF3 has a dual function on mRNA translation during the type I

416

IFN response by enabling translation of ISGs mRNAs and impairing TOP mRNA polysomal

417

association. In addition, ILF3 was found to repress association of AT-rich genes with

418

polysomes. All these together support the hypothesis that ILF3 has a major role in regulating

419

the association with polysomes of important subtypes of genes during the host translational

420

shutoff.

421

ILF3 is necessary for type I IFN induction in response to dsRNA

422

As we have shown that ILF3 has an essential role in the expression of ISGs, we next wanted

423

to evaluate the functional relevance of this regulation. For this purpose, mock or ILF3-

424

depleted A549 cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) and the supernatant, or conditioned

425

medium, was collected and added to naive cells to measure ISG induction and confirm

426

differential type I IFN production and secondly, measure differential protection against viral

427

infections (Figure 6A). Addition of conditioned medium from poly(I:C) stimulated cells

428

induced the expression of ISGs IFIT1, RSAD2, IFIH1 and DDX58, and as expected, medium

429

from ILF3-depleted cells resulted in significantly lower expression levels of the same ISGs

430

(Figure 6B), confirming that the production of type I IFN, which is essential to drive the

431

expression of these genes, is diminished in the absence of ILF3.

432

As a functional approach, we tested if conditioned medium generated in the absence of ILF3

433

conferred decreased resistance to viral infections. Serial dilutions of conditioned medium

434

were added to fresh A549 cells to test their sensitivity to Echovirus 7 infection by TCID50.

435

Conditioned medium generated in ILF3-depleted cells was able to confer less resistance to

436

Echovirus 7 infections, with an almost 100-fold reduction in protection observed at the lowest

437

dilution (Figure 6C). To verify if the differential expression of IFN-β was in part responsible

438

for the observed difference in susceptibility, one of the subunits of the type I IFN receptor,

439

IFNAR1, was neutralized by pre-incubating cells with an anti-IFNAR1 antibody before

440

addition of conditioned medium. Mock versus ILF3-depleted conditioned medium resulted

441

again in significant differences in conferring viral protection to Echovirus 7 and blocking of

442

IFNAR receptor impaired the antiviral protection effect, rendering cells susceptible to

443

Echovirus 7 reaching similar levels to the untreated control (Figure 6D). These results

444

support the hypothesis that differences in viral protection observed between mock and ILF3-

445

depleted cells are caused by differential production of ISGs, highlighting again the central

446

role for ILF3 in facilitating the establishment of a robust cellular type I IFN response upon

447

dsRNA stimulation.

448

Discussion

449

The activation of the dsRNA-mediated antiviral response involves drastic changes in the gene

450

expression program of cells which needs to be tightly regulated from transcription to

451

translation. In this work, we propose that the RNA-binding protein ILF3, which is involved in

452

many steps of RNA processing during homeostasis, is also essential for establishing a robust

453

type I IFN program upon dsRNA stimulation. We found this factor acts at the level of

454

induction of ISGs as well as enhancing their translation. These results agree with the

455

previously reported antiviral role of the ILF3 isoforms in the context of HIV and (+) ssRNA

456

viral infections, although these effects were proposed to be mediated by direct binding of

457

ILF3 isoforms to the viral genome or viral proteins (50)(51)(52)(53). To assess whether

458

ILF3-mediated regulation of the gene expression pathway was mediated by direct association

459

of ILF3 with the different transcripts, we compared our results to publicly available CLIP

460

datasets (54). Unfortunately, ILF3 binding is too ubiquitous to obtain clear correlations

461

between binding and changes in gene expression upon ILF3 depletion. Whereas our analyses

462

revealed that ILF3 binds to thousands of different genes, it primarily overlapped with Alu-

463

derived sequences (data not shown), confirming similar recent observations (55)(25).

464

ILF3 had been previously suggested to have an inhibitory role for the translation of mRNAs

465

harbouring AT-rich motifs during homeostasis (18)(19). Interestingly, our results suggest a

466

similar role for ILF3 during the type I IFN response. AT-rich mRNAs were dissociated from

467

polysomes during the host translational shutoff, but this effect was reverted in the absence of

468

ILF3, confirming a role of ILF3 in inhibiting translation of AT-rich mRNAs during the host

469

translational shutoff. In addition, ILF3 was found to be essential for efficient polysomal

470

dissociation of TOP mRNAs upon dsRNA stimulation. This effect did not seem to be a

471

consequence of differential activation of the host translational shutoff in the absence of ILF3,

472

since similar levels of phosphorylated eIF2α were detected. However, a decrease in total

473

mRNA levels for TOP genes was also observed upon dsRNA stimulation (Figure 1C),

474

suggesting that the differential polysome loading could be the combined result of regulating

475

the available pool of TOP mRNAs as well as their association with polysomes. In contrast to

476

these, ILF3 was shown to be required for efficient translation of IFNB1 and a subgroup of

477

ISGs, suggesting an additional role for ILF3 as a positive factor for translating essential self-

478

defence genes during the inhibition of cap-dependent translation. Regarding ISGs, such as

479

IFIT3 and DDX58, ILF3 only affected their association with polysomes, resulting in

480

decreased protein production. However, in a considerable proportion of the ISGs analysed,

481

ILF3 depletion resulted in both changes in their RNA steady state levels and their polysomal

482

association, suggesting that both effects could provide a certain level of redundancy to

483

guarantee optimal levels of these antiviral factors. An additional layer of complexity is

484

provided by the fact that ILF3 directly regulates the production of the main inducer of ISGs,

485

the type I IFN, IFN-β. To disentangle the specific contribution of ILF3 in controlling ISGs

486

translation, polysome profiling of these mRNAs was studied upon exogenous IFN-β

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/809608; this version posted October 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

487

stimulation in the absence of ILF3. These analyses revealed that the role of ILF3 in

488

controlling ISG levels and polysome loading was largely conserved between dsRNA and

489

exogenous IFN-β stimulation, suggesting that direct ILF3 action and not the differential

490

expression of IFN-β is responsible for this regulation. Considering these results, we also

491

hypothesize that other cues resulting in type I IFN expression, such as cytoplasmic DNA or

492

Toll-like receptors ligands, could also depend on ILF3 to provide effective levels of these

493

relevant antiviral products.

494

To date, it is still unknown how ISGs escape the host translational shutoff and engage with

495

polysomes in the infected cells. Upon dsRNA stimulation, TOP mRNAs and other highly

496

expressed genes disengage from polysomes. This observation raises the exciting hypothesis

497

that disengagement of highly expressed genes from the polysomal fractions during stress or

498

poor-translating environments, may be an essential step to allow polysomal engagement of

499

IFNs and ISGs. Interestingly, the regulation of IFNB1 mRNA translation was found to be

500

specific for the NF110 isoform, which correlates with a shift in its polysomal co-

501

sedimentation pattern upon dsRNA stimulation. The shift of NF110 to lighter ribosomal

502

fractions during the translational shutoff leads us to hypothesize that NF110 could be

503

supporting successful initiation of translation of IFNB1 and specific ISGs. In agreement with

504

previous reports, we also found PKR to be essential for efficient association of NF110 with

505

translating ribosomes (13), which also suggests that either direct protein-protein interactions

506

with PKR, or some basal phosphorylating activity of PKR on NF110 may be necessary to

507

retain this factor associated with polysomes during homeostasis.

508

Whereas our study supports a positive role for ILF3 in promoting type I IFN and ISGs

509

translation in cells in which cap-dependent translation is compromised, the specific

510

mechanism by which the translation of these cytokines bypasses the translation shutoff during

511

the antiviral response remains unknown. Although type I IFNs increased the levels of PKR,

512

thus amplifying the translational shutoff response, they have also been shown to stimulate the

513

translation of certain ISGs in specific cell types. Type I IFNs can activate the AKT-mTOR

514

pathway, which in turns phosphorylates and inactivates the repressor of translation 4E-BP1

515

(56). In agreement, absence of 4EBP1 enhances expression of ISG15 and CXCL10 upon IFN

516

stimulation (57). In addition, type I IFNs activate the MAPK pathways, a necessary step for

517

efficient translation of ISG15 and IFIT2 (58). Taking all these results into account,

518

differential translation and production of the type I IFN, IFN-β, upon ILF3 depletion could

519

also be indirectly affecting the levels and translation of some ISGs.

520

In summary, we have identified ILF3 as a stimulatory factor in the establishment of an

521

optimal type I IFN antiviral program, in which ILF3 enhances the production of IFN-β and

522

ISGs, thus ensuring effective levels of antiviral factors in conditions where cap-dependent

523

translation is compromised.

KEGG and reactome analyses of differentially upregulated (top left) and downregulated (bottom left) genes during the
antiviral response. Similar KEGG reactome categories are obtained during the antiviral response in the absence of ILF3,
for both upregulated (top right) and downregulated (bottom right) groups. Only the top 5 categories are included.
