I. ABSTRACT

2

1. In diverse ecosystems, organisms cluster together in such a manner that the

3

frequency distribution of cluster sizes is a power-law function. Spatially-explicit

4

models of ecosystems suggest that loss of such power-law clustering may indicate

5

loss of ecosystem resilience. Hence, it is hypothesised that spatial clustering

6

properties in ecosystems - which can be readily measured using remotely-sensed

7

high-resolution data - can help infer proximity to ecosystem thresholds and may

8

even provide early warning signals of ecosystem collapse. Recent empirical and

9

simulation studies, however, don’t find consistent relationships between spatial

10

clustering and ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, how spatial clustering metrics

11

relate to other well-known early warning signals of ecosystems collapse, specifi-

12

cally the phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD), remains unclear.

13

2. We synthesize the literature on cluster sizes in empirical and theoretical studies

14

that show how local interactions (especially, positive feedback) among organisms

15

can cause power-law clustering. In addition, we analyse a minimal spatial model

16

of ecosystem transitions that allows us to disentangle the role of environmental

17

stressor and positive feedback on spatial patterns and ecosystem resilience.

18

3. Our literature synthesis reveals that empirically observed power-law cluster-

19

ing in ecosystems is parsimoniously explained by local positive feedback. Our

20

synthesis together with model analysis demonstrates that, depending on the

21

strength of positive feedback, emergence of power-law clustering can occur at

22

any distance from the critical threshold of ecosystem collapse. In fact, we find

23

that for systems with strong positive feedbacks, which are most likely to exhibit

24

abrupt transitions, loss of power-law clustering may not even occur prior to

25

ecosystem thresholds. We also argue that cluster-size distributions are unrelated

26

to the phenomenon of CSD.

27

4. We demonstrate that, due to CSD, a power-law feature does occur near critical

28

thresholds but in a different quantity; specifically, a power-law decay of spatial

29

correlations of ecosystem state.

30

5. We conclude that loss of power-law clustering cannot be used as a reliable

31

indicator of ecosystem resilience. Our synthesis and model analyses highlights

32

links between local positive feedback, emergent spatial properties and how they

33

may be used to interpret ecosystem resilience.

II. INTRODUCTION

35

Desertification of semi-arid ecosystems (van de Koppel et al. 2002), eutrophica-

36

tion of lakes (Carpenter et al. 1999), spread of diseases (Chaves et al. 2012), inva-

37

sion (Hansen et al. 2013) and community shifts in coral reefs (Knowlton 2004) are

38

some examples of state transitions or regime shifts in ecological systems. Some

39

of these transitions can be abrupt and irreversible, leading to catastrophic loss

40

of wildlife, habitats, and ecosystem services. Such transitions are also known as

41

critical transitions in the ecology literature. They happen when a system crosses

42

a certain threshold, called critical threshold, of environmental conditions. Over

43

the last decade, several studies have devised and validated methods to detect

44

the vulnerability of ecosystems to transitions (Carpenter et al. 2011, Dakos et al.

45

2012, 2011, Eby et al. 2017, Guttal and Jayaprakash 2009, Kéfi et al. 2014, Kéfi et al.

46

2007, Scheffer et al. 2009). One such method is based on the idea that patterns of

47

self-organisation in ecosystems can offer signatures of resilience (Kéfi et al. 2014,

48

Kéfi et al. 2007, Rietkerk et al. 2004, von Hardenberg et al. 2001). Self-organised

49

patterns themselves often result from an interplay of facilitative and competitive

50

interactions among organisms (Manor and Shnerb 2008, Scanlon et al. 2007, von

51

Hardenberg et al. 2010). Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how lo-

52

cal interactions between organisms scale to their spatial distribution and affect

53

ecosystem resilience, is of broad ecological interest.

54

Of many varieties of self-organization found in nature (D’Odorico et al. 2012,

55

Kéfi et al. 2007, Rietkerk and van de Koppel 2008, Scanlon et al. 2007), we focus

56

on spatial patterns where organisms exhibit clustering of irregular size and shape

57

(see Glossary); these are found in many ecosystems such as semi-arid ecosystems,

58

mussel beds or seagrass (Fig 1). Here, the frequency distributions of these cluster-

59

sizes may follow a power-law function (henceforth referred to as power-law clus-

60

tering). These are interesting because they may imply that systems lack charac-

61

teristic size/shape (see Box 1 for a summary of properties of power-laws). Some

62

simulation and empirical studies suggest that when ecosystems are stressed, clus-

63

ters fragment leading to loss of large patches (Kéfi et al. 2014, Kéfi et al. 2007). This

64

results in a qualitative change in the properties of cluster sizes, from a power-law

65

to an exponential distribution. The progressive truncation of the tail of the power-

66

law clustering has, therefore, been hypothesised to represent loss of resilience in

67

ecosystems (Fernández and Fort 2009, Kéfi et al. 2014, Kéfi et al. 2007, Kéfi et al.

68

2011, Lin et al. 2010, Weerman et al. 2012).

69

Empirical evidence for this hypothesis, however, is ambiguous (Maestre and

70

Escudero 2009, Meloni et al. 2017b, Weerman et al. 2012). Additionally, simu-

71

lation studies in more complex models suggest that details of systems matter,

72

thus questioning the generality of these cluster based indicators (Génin et al.

73

2018b, Schneider and Kéfi 2016). Nevertheless, the possibility of inferring ecosys-

74

tem resilience from a single snapshot and the increasing availability of low-cost

75

remotely-sensed spatial datasets, where these methods can be applied, is attrac-

76

tive. Therefore, an evaluation of the generality and robustness of clustering prop-

77

erties as a signature of ecosystem resilience is needed.

78

To understand issues of generality, we must discuss another class of power-

79

law behaviours that are considered universal features near/at critical points of

80

phase transitions. Here, we emphasize that the theoretical underpinnings of

81

ecosystem dynamics and indicators of stability are based on principles derived

82

from the theory of phase transitions and bifurcations (Scheffer et al. 2009, Stro-

83

gatz et al. 1994). This theory predicts that as a system nears a critical point of

84

phase transitions, it takes increasingly longer to recover from perturbations. This

85

phenomenon of slowed recovery is called critical slowing down (CSD) in the con-

86

text of continuous phase transitions in the physics literature. However, a similar

87

effect of slowed recovery appears even in ecological models that show abrupt

88

transitions (Scheffer et al. 2009, Strogatz et al. 1994, Wissel 1984). Consequently,

89

CSD has been widely used to devise methods to detect the approach of critical

90

thresholds in ecosystems (Scheffer et al. 2009, Wissel 1984). An aspect of CSD

91

that is much less known in the ecology literature is that close to, and at the crit-

92

ical point, the strength of perturbation decays as a power-law function of time

93

- indicating a very slow recovery (Ma 2000, Sethna 2006, Stanley 1999); this is

94

in contrast to systems far away from thresholds where perturbations decay ex-

95

ponentially fast. In fact, many power-law behaviours arise near/at continuous

96

phase transitions (Ma 2000, Sethna 2006, Stanley 1999).

97

We highlight an interesting contrast between the two power-law relationships

98

we have discussed thus far: While the power-laws associated with CSD are ex-

99

pected to emerge near/at critical points of phase transitions (Ma 2000, Sethna 2006),

100

the power-laws in clustering are hypothesised to be lost near/at critical thresh-

101

olds of ecosystem collapse (Kéfi et al. 2007). It is now fairly well established

102

that many mechanisms cause emergence of power-laws even away from critical

103

thresholds (Newman 2005, Pascual and Guichard 2005, Roy et al. 2003). However,

104

the theoretical basis for why a loss of power-law clustering can indicate approach

105

to a critical threshold in ecosystem models is unclear. Furthermore, elucidating

106

relationships (if any) between the dynamical phenomenon of CSD and cluster

107

size properties, has not gained attention in the literature. Such an exercise will

108

not only prove helpful in evaluating the generality of ecosystem resilience in-

109

dicators but also reveal the crucial role of local positive feedback in ecosystem

110

patterning.

111

In this article, we review and synthesize the literature on how local ecological

112

processes lead to the formation and dynamics of clusters, and how the resulting

113

spatial patterns relate to ecosystem stability. Owing to the interdisciplinary na-

114

ture of the study, we introduce important terms and concepts via summaries in

115

Boxes 1, 2 and 3 and a glossary in Table 1.

116

We summarize our main findings here: First, our synthesis reveals the im5

117

portance of local positive feedback in the emergence of power-law clustering in

118

various ecosystems. To probe the relationship between positive feedback, clus-

119

tering and resilience, we use a spatially-explicit model which, unlike previous

120

relatively complex models, decouples the effects of positive feedback and envi-

121

ronmental stress. Together with synthesis of previous studies, our analyses en-

122

ables us to demonstrate that power-law clustering (or loss thereof) is unrelated

123

to resilience. We then demonstrate how CSD - a universal feature of dynamical

124

systems near thresholds - manifests as a power-law decay of spatial correlations.

125

We discuss the important role of positive feedback in shaping clustering proper-

126

ties and suggest future directions of research to quantify patterns/dynamics of

127

clustering and to infer ecological interactions.

Glossary
1. Regime shifts: Changes in qualitative nature of ecosystem states. These changes can be
abrupt or gradual functions of the underlying drivers.
2. Critical threshold: The value of an environmental condition (such as rainfall) and/or state
variable (e.g. woody cover) at which a system undergoes an abrupt regime shift. In some
ecology papers, it is used interchangeably with critical point but here we avoid doing so.
3. Resilience: The amount of change a system can withstand without transitioning to an alternative state. In the model described in Box 2, we interpret resilience as the distance to
the threshold driver (or density).
4. Stability: The rate at which a system recovers to its original equilibrium from small perturbations.
5. Critical point: In the physics literature, this term refers to the value of driver at which the
system typically undergoes a continuous phase transition from one state to the other.
6. Critical slowing down: The phenomenon in which systems near threshold of transitions
are slow to recover from perturbations.
7. Positive feedback: Interactions between individuals that resuls in enhanced reproduction
and/or reduced death rates of both individuals.
8. Cluster: A set of individuals who are within a minimum distance (typically the nearest
neighbor distance) of at least one member of the same set.
9. Scale-free: A quantity having infinite average value, thus lacking a characteristic scale.
Also see Box 1.
10. Percolation: In the physics literature, percolation is the movement/spread of an agent
through the entire extent of the system via a connected path of sites.
11. Percolation density: The lowest density of occupied sites at which a fully connected path in
the system is possible. At the same density, we observe a scale-free distribution of cluster
sizes in the landscape.
12. Spatial autocovariance function: Covariance between states at two locations as a function
of the distance between them. Also see Box 3.

BOX 1: POWER-LAW AND SCALE-FREE BEHAVIOURS

159

Biology is replete with examples of self-organised spatial clustering (Guichard

160

et al. 2003, Rietkerk and van de Koppel 2008, von Hardenberg et al. 2001). In

161

some cases, clumps have a wide range of sizes such that the frequency of occur-

162

rence of clumps of a particular size (denoted by x) decays as a power function of

163

the size i.e. f (x) = c x−β (defined for all clusters above a size x > xmin with c and

164

β being constants).Below we describe two interesting properties of this function.

power-law is evident here too.

177

Scale-free power-laws
Power-laws with an exponent β ≤ 2 mathematically describe features that lack a
characteristic size/length scale. To see this, we observe that when β ≤ 2 the mean of
this distribution is infinite. Exact expressions for the mean (x̄) and variance (σx2 )
of the (normalised) power-law probability density function, denoted by p(x), are
given by

Thus, there is no characteristic size or typical length scale in this distribution,
when β ≤ 2, and therefore the distribution is called scale-free. Power-law distri-

180

butions of biological quantities with exponents β ≤ 2 are therefore intriguing.

181

Such distributions, however, are not uncommon and have been documented in

182

various ecosystems (Fig 1).

178

183

BOX 2: SPATIAL MODEL WITH POSITIVE FEEDBACK

184

Several spatial models in ecology try to explain power-law clustering but due

185

to their relative complexity, it is difficult to clearly elucidate the role of positive

186

feedback on clustering and resilience (Guichard et al. 2003, Kéfi et al. 2007, Man-

187

rubia and Solé 1997, Scanlon et al. 2007). To address this problem, we employ

188

a simple spatially-explicit model with only two parameters. In this model, we

189

consider a discrete two-dimensional space where each grid cell is updated prob-

190

abilistically depending on states of cells in its neighbourhood. The simplicity

191

of this model allows us to independently tune, and thus study effects of, envi-

192

ronmental driver and positive feedback on spatial patterns via two parameters p

193

and q, respectively. See Fig 3 for a schematic of the update rules; detailed model

194

description is available in Appendix A and was first described in the physics lit-

195

erature in Lübeck (2006) and has been recently adopted in the context of regime

196

shifts (Eby et al. 2017). Using this model, we study the effect of positive feedback

197

(q) on steady-state density (defined as proportion of occupied sites) and spatial

198

patterns (quantified via cluster size distributions and spatial power-spectrum) as

199

a function of the environmental driver p. We add that reducing p in this model

200

can also be interpreted as increasing environmental stress.

201

Positive feedback and abrupt regime shifts: Stronger positive feedback

202

in ecosystems are known to cause non-linear and even abrupt responses to

203

stress (Kéfi et al. 2010, 2016, Xu et al. 2015b). In our model too, when positive

Figure 3: Schematic representation of the model and simulation procedure, for a given ‘Initial
lattice’ shown at the centre of the top row. The parameter p represents baseline birth rate
whereas q represents the strength of local positive feedback; reducing p in this model can be
interpreted as increasing environmental stress. Light blue circles represent (randomly) chosen
cells to update. Depending on the states of chosen cells, the update scheme results in baseline
birth or death (left part of second row), or increased birth or reduced death due to positive
feedback (right part of the second row). The box at the bottom shows (i) neighbours of a focal
pair of cells and (ii) model udpate rules captured via transition probabilities.

204

feedback is weak, the system undergoes a continuous transition from an occu-

205

pied to a bare state as we increase environmental stress (Fig 4a). As positive

206

feedback strength increases, the system can maintain a high density state even

207

for higher levels of stress; but the system also exhibits an abrupt transition to a

208

bare state when the stressor crosses the critical threshold. Henceforth, we refer

209

to the point of transition (defined by either driver value (p) or density (ρ)) from

210

an occupied to a bare state as threshold. When we specifically refer to a continu-

211

ous transition, we call it a critical point whereas the corresponding term for the

212

discontinuous transition is critical threshold (also see Glossary).

III. POSITIVE FEEDBACK PROMOTES POWER-LAW CLUSTERING AT RELA-

214

TIVELY LOW DENSITIES

215

Power-law cluster size distributions are seen in diverse ecosystems, includ-

216

ing drylands, mussel beds, seagrass beds, sawgrass and forest fires (Fig 1). Many

217

studies propose that these systems are likely shaped by positive feedback (Aguiar

218

and Sala 1994, Boada et al. 2017, Dell et al. 2016, Foti et al. 2013, Guichard et al.

219

2003, Kéfi et al. 2007, Knowlton 2004, Maestre et al. 2003, Scanlon et al. 2007).

220

For example, in semi-arid landscapes, seed germination and seedling survival

221

probabilities are higher in the neighbourhood of other plants than out in the

222

open (Aguiar and Sala 1994, Maestre et al. 2003). This results from reduced light

223

and heat stress as well as increased water availability to young saplings in the

224

vicinity of adult plants. Similarly, in mussel-beds, steadfast attachment of mussel

225

to the substrate is directly dependent on the attachment of neighbours (Guichard

226

et al. 2003). In macroalgal beds, recruitment and survival of macroalgal fronds

227

shows density dependence due to the protection offered by neighbours from her-

228

bivory by sea urchin and fish (Boada et al. 2017, Dell et al. 2016).

229

To understand how positive feedback promotes such clustering, it is insight-

230

ful to first discuss how power-law cluster-size distributions are also realised in

231

‘null models’ that are devoid of any interactions among organisms. In spatial

232

null models, individuals are initially assigned to random locations on a two10

233

dimensional discrete lattice. They then either die or give birth to an offspring

234

at a rate that does not depend on presence/absence of any individual on the

235

landscape (Kéfi et al. 2011). Consequently, the proportion of occupied sites in the

236

landscape (henceforth called density) changes from nonzero values to zero (a bare

237

state) as a gradual function of decreasing birth (or increasing death) rates (Grim-

238

mett 1999, Kéfi et al. 2011). These null models correspond to classic models in

239

the physics literature in the context of a phenomenon called percolation (Stauffer

240

1979). The lowest density at which there is a non-zero probability of emergence

241

of a fully connected path in the system is called the percolation density; at the per-

242

colation density (denoted by ρp ), the system also shows a scale-free clustering. In

243

other words, despite the lack of positive feedback in these null models, a power-

244

law cluster size distribution with β < 2, and hence scale-free clustering, occurs

245

at the percolation density (ρp ). The value of percolation density depends on the

246

geometry of the landscape. For ecological contexts, a relevant geometry is that of

247

two dimensional square lattice where the percolation density is 0.59 (Grimmett

248

1999, Stauffer 1979).

249

In many ecosystems, densities that correspond to power-law clustering are

250

typically lower than the above mentioned percolation density of the null model.

251

For example, regions in the Kalahari show power-law cluster-size distributions

252

of vegetation for densities ranging from 0.14 to 0.54 (Scanlon et al. 2007); a bulk

253

of these areas also exhibit power-laws with exponent β < 2, and are thus scale-

254

free (see Box 1 and Glossary). Power-law cluster-size distributions observed in

255

several other ecosystems also show exponents within the scale-free range (e.g.

256

Fig 1). To explain such power-law clustering, many spatial ecological models of

257

ecosystems have been developed (Grassberger 1993, Guichard et al. 2003, Kéfi

258

et al. 2007, Manrubia and Solé 1997, Scanlon et al. 2007). These models often in-

259

corporate ecosystem-specific processes and are consequently complex, involving

260

many parameters. Nevertheless, they have commonalities. For example, they all

261

assume local positive feedback in some form that causes increased birth (or re-

262

duced death) rates of individuals who are surrounded by others (Box 2). Below,

263

we explain how local positive feedback can lower the percolation density.

264

The emergence of power-law clustering depends on how local interactions be-

265

tween individuals scale to cluster dynamics. Even in spatial null models that are

266

devoid of any positive interactions, clusters form entirely due to random filling

267

of the lattice; furthermore, larger clusters are more likely to merge with other

268

clusters and therefore have higher growth rates. Theory predicts that power-law

269

clustering emerges whenever clusters grow in proportion to their size, a phe-

270

nomenon known as proportionate growth (Grimmett 1999, Manor and Shnerb

271

2008, Stauffer 1979). Such growth occurs at the percolation density of 0.59 for the

272

spatial null models for a square lattice. In models with local positive interactions,

273

empty sites near an existing cluster of occupied states are more likely to become

274

occupied. This not only expands the original cluster but also increases chances

275

of merger of this cluster with a nearby cluster. This dynamic of clusters is con-

276

trast to the spatial null model where expansion as well as merger of clusters are

277

driven entirely by the random filling of the landscape. Therefore, in models with

278

positive feedback, proportionate growth and scale-free cluster size distributions

279

(i.e. a power-law with 1 < β < 2) occur at densities lower than the percolation

280

density of the null model (Scanlon et al. 2007). This may offer a potential expla-

281

nation for the observed low densities at which power-law clustering is seen in

282

many ecosystems (Fig 1).

283

We support this argument by showing

284

how percolation density changes with pos-

285

itive feedback in our model (Box 2). To do

286

so, we use the concept of percolation proba-

287

bility which is defined as the probability of

288

occurrence of a fully-connected path of oc-

289

cupied cells in the landscape. In Fig 5, we

display the percolation probability as a function of density for two different values of
positive feedback and the spatial null model.
We then identify percolation density as the
lowest density at which this probability is
non-zero. We find that the percolation density is lower for the system with higher positive feedback, consistent with our synthesis
of previous theoretical and empirical stud12

299

ies discussed above. Interestingly, we also observe that weak positive feedback

300

leads to continuous change in percolation probability whereas strong positive

301

feedback, owing to stronger nonlinear response of the system, makes it discon-

302

tinuous (Fig 5).

303

Putting empirical studies together with spatially-explicit models of clustering,

304

we conjecture that strong positive feedback is likely to be the key interaction low-

305

ering percolation density in many ecosystems.

306

IV. CLUSTER-SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT INDICATORS OF ECOSYSTEM

307

RESILIENCE

308

Let us now use the above link we established between positive feedback and

309

cluster-size distributions to address the larger question: how general is the rela-

310

tionship between cluster-size distributions and ecosystem resilience?

311

Studies over the last decade have suggested that fragmentation of large clus-

312

ters leads to a thinning of the tail of the cluster-size distribution. Consequently,

313

this causes loss of a power-law clustering, which can be used as an indicator of a

314

stressed and less resilient ecosystem (Génin et al. 2018a, Kéfi et al. 2014, Kéfi et al.

315

2007). A corollary to this hypothesis is that ecosystems with power-law cluster-

316

ing are relatively farther from critical thresholds, and hence are likely to be more

317

resilient. The evidence for this hypothesis in both models and data, however,

318

has been ambiguous (Maestre and Escudero 2009, Meloni et al. 2017b, Moreno-

319

de las Heras et al. 2011, Schneider and Kéfi 2016). Therefore, the generality of the

320

relationship between cluster sizes and resilience remains unknown.

321

To resolve this, let us first consider how positive feedback affects both spatial

322

clusters and resilience. As we argued in section III, positive feedback lowers the

323

percolation density. Additionally, positive feedback promotes abrupt transitions

324

and increases the threshold value of density from which the regime shift happens

325

(Fig 4). Therefore, we hypothesize that, depending on the strength of positive

326

feedback, power-law clustering can occur at any distance from the threshold of

327

regime shift. We make predictions for two scenarios: we predict that in systems
13

328

with weak positive feedback, the distance between percolation density and thresh-

329

old of regime shift will be relatively large. Thus, increasing stress and an ap-

330

proach to threshold follows the previously expected pattern of loss of power-law

331

clustering (Kéfi et al. 2014). In contrast, for systems with strong positive feedback,

332

which are most likely to exhibit abrupt transitions, the distance between percola-

333

tion density and the critical threshold of collapse will be negligble or even zero.

334

Hence, power-law clustering may occur at the critical threshold itself and the loss

335

of power-law clustering cannot be used as a resilience indicator.

336

To buttress our arguments, we analyse the model presented in Box 2. Indeed,

337

our model analysis confirms our expectations: A weak positive feedback scenario

338

shows that percolation density (ρp ) is relatively far from the threshold of transi-

339

tion (ρp ) (Fig 6a and inset); moreover, we find that loss of power-law clustering

340

and appearance of thin-tailed (exponential) cluster-size distribution precedes the

341

transition (see Appendix C). Our model reveals that this distance between the

342

density of threshold of transition and percolation density reduces as a function

343

of positive feedback and becomes even zero for large values of positive feedback

344

(Fig 6c, d). Consequently, the qualitative features of cluster size distribution (e.g.

345

being a power-law, truncated power-law or exponential) do not follow a general

346

trend as a function of ecosystem stress see Appendix C. In Fig 6b and inset, we

347

show a case where a strong positive feedback scenario shows a power-law clus-

348

tering occurring very near, even possibly at, the critical threshold of collapse. Put

349

together, our model analyses suggests that the relationship between cluster-sizes

350

and ecosystem resilience heavily depends on the strength of positive feedback

351

in the ecosystem. We recall that systems with strong positive feedback are most

352

likely to exhibit abrupt shifts; it is precisely in these systems that the expected

353

trend of cluster-size distributions, of loss of power-law as the system approaches

354

thresholds, is least likely to be true. This questions the generality as well as po-

355

tential utility of cluster-size distributions as indicators of ecosystem resilience.

356

We discuss above results in light of theoretical studies which too have found

357

the association of cluster-size distributions with resilience to be tenuous (Génin

358

et al. 2018b, Schneider and Kéfi 2016). These studies investigate spatially-explicit

359

models of dryland vegetation and forest gap dynamics. They include, for exam-

360

ple, a lowered grazing-induced mortality for individuals with more neighbours,

a process termed associative protection. When the associative protection is high,

362

they find power-law clustering at/near the critical thresholds of collapse. These

363

results are consistent with our synthesis because associative protection in their

364

model (i.e., reduced mortality for plants with neighboring plants) is analogous to

365

increased positive feedback in our model (which causes reduced death rates for

366

individuals with neighbors).

367

Synthesizing our results together with these recent studies, we argue that

368

cluster-size distribution primarily depends on the strength of the positive feed-

369

back and that it cannot be employed as an indicator of ecosystem resilience.

370

Furthermore, since cluster-size distributions do not primarily depend on prox-

371

imity to critical threshold in these stochastic and spatial ecological models, we

372

conclude that it is also unrelated to critical slowing down (CSD); we recall that

373

CSD is a generic dynamical feature of systems near critical thresholds. See next

374

section on how CSD influences spatial properties and causes power-law features

375

in them.

376

V. SCALE-FREE SPATIAL CORRELATIONS MAY ARISE AT CRITICAL THRESH-

377

OLDS OF ECOSYSTEM COLLAPSE

378

So far, we have demonstrated that cluster-size distribution do not represent

379

resilience and hence cannot reliably indicate imminent regime shifts. However,

380

the theory of phase transitions posits the emergence of scale-free features near/at

381

critical points. Here, using our spatially-explicit ecological model, we illustrate

382

how critical slowing down - a canonical features of dynamical systems near

383

thresholds - causes scale-free behaviour in the spatial autocovariance function

384

(Fig 7; Box 3;).

385

As an ecosystem approaches a critical threshold, its return to equilibrium

386

state, when perturbed, becomes increasingly slower. This phenomenon of crit-

387

ical slowing down (Ma 2000, Scheffer et al. 2009, Wissel 1984) has two impli-

388

cations - increased spatial correlations (Dakos et al. 2010) and increased spatial

389

variance (Guttal and Jayaprakash 2009). To understand this, consider how a per-

390

turbation from the equilibrium state at any location in the ecosystem will spread

391

in space. First, owing to slowed dynamics, the perturbation lives longer and,

392

via spatial connectedness in the system, propagates to larger distances in the

393

system (Ma 2000, Sethna 2006). Consequently, a measure of spread of perturba-

394

tion, the correlation length, increases (Dakos et al. 2010, Ma 2000, Sethna 2006).

395

Second, as the perturbations persist for longer duration, further disturbances

396

enhance amplitudes of the fluctuations. This manifests as increasing spatial vari16

397

ance in the ecosystem as it moves towards the threshold (Guttal and Jayaprakash

398

2009). Here, we consider the spatial autocovariance function, defined as covari-

399

ance of local densities at two locations separated by a distance r (Box 3). This

400

function captures both spatial variance and correlations.

401

Before we illustrate computations of spatial autocovariance for our model, we

402

make a couple of technical remarks. First, physicists often refer to the autoco-

403

variance function as the ‘correlation function’; some theoretical papers in ecology

404

also do the same (Roy et al. 2003). Here, we have adopted the standard termi-

405

nology that is used in quantitative ecology literature (Eq 2 in Box 3). Second, the

406

theory of phase transition predicts critical slowing down and consequent scale-

407

free behaviour at critical points of continuous phase transitions (Ma 2000, Sethna

408

2006). However, it has been shown that signatures of CSD are present, albeit

409

with a relatively less magnitude, even in ecological models exhibiting abrupt

410

transitions (Dakos et al. 2011, Scheffer et al. 2009). Consequently, we argue and

411

demonstrate using the simple ecological model presented in Box 2 that scale-free

412

behaviour may characterize critical thresholds of abrupt transitions as well.

413

Calculation of the spatial autocovariance function is often beset with statistical

414

and computational difficulties. Therefore, we focus on a mathematically equiva-

415

lent measure of correlations in spatial patterns via its power spectrum (Kéfi et al.

416

2014) (Box 3; Appendix D). It can be shown that the power spectrum is the Fourier

417

transform of the autocovariance function (Reif 2009). The power spectrum of a

418

spatial pattern provides a measure of the relative contribution of fluctuations at

419

different spatial frequencies in the system, to its overall pattern. It is known in the

420

ecology literature that as systems approach critical thresholds, the low frequency

421

modes begin to dominate their power spectrum (Carpenter and Brock 2010, Kéfi

422

et al. 2014). However, the full functional form of the power-spectrum is rarely

423

quantified (but see Barbier et al. (2006), Bonachela et al. (2015), Couteron (2002)

424

in the context of periodic and multi-scale patterns of dryland vegetation). Simu-

425

lations of our model shows that the power-spectrum indeed becomes scale-free

426

at critical thresholds for systems with both weak and strong positive feedback

427

(Fig 7). We explain in Box 3 that a scale-free power spectrum is indicative of a

428

scale-free autocovariance function. Thus, scale-free power-spectrum character-

429

izes the structure of spatial perturbations near/at critical thresholds of ecosystem

431

BOX 3: COVARIANCE, CORRELATION AND SPECTRAL FUNCTION

432

One way to capture the spread of disturbance in a system or the length scale of

433

spatial fluctuations, is by constructing the spatial covariance function. The spatial

434

autocovariance function for local density ρ for a distance r is defined as
C(r) = h(ρ(x) − ρ̄)(ρ(x0 ) − ρ̄)i

(1)

435

where ρ̄ represents mean density over the entire landscape, angular brackets de-

436

note average over all locations x and x0 in the landscape that are separated by a

437

distance r. Ecologists widely use the correlation function which is defined as
K(r) =

h(ρ(x) − ρ̄)(ρ(x0 ) − ρ̄)i
)
σ2

(2)

438

where σ 2 is the spatial variance of densities in the ecosystem. Thus the covariance

439

function is a production of the correlation function and the variance.

440

The correlation length is defined as the mean of the covariance function and can

441

be interpreted as the average distance to which local fluctuations spread. The cor18

442

relation length becomes infinite at the critical thresholds. This means that the co-

443

variance function then follows a power-law with an exponent less than 2 (Box 1).

444

The power spectrum, denoted by S(k), is the Fourier transform of its autocovari-

445

ance function (Baugh and Murdin 2006, Reif 2009). Therefore, it can be calculated

446

as
Z
S(k) =

447

448

C(r)e−ikr dr

(3)

At critical thresholds, we expect the spatial covariance function to exhibit a
power-law relation with distance
C(x) = c0 x−α

(4)

where c0 is a constant and α is an exponent less than two. The corresponding
spectral function for an n-dimensional system is given by
|S(k)| ∼ k−(n−α)

449

Therefore, evidence of a power-law spectral function is also evidence of a power-

450

law autocovariance function.

451

VI. DISCUSSION

452

In this study, we set out to investigate the generality of the conclusion that

453

loss of power-law clustering in ecosystems is indicative of reducing resilience.

454

First, our synthesis reveals that power-law clustering (or lack thereof) is unrelated

455

to ecosystem resilience. We argue that this is because power-law clustering is

456

fundamentally associated with local positive feedback rather than any generic

457

dynamics of systems near critical thresholds of ecosystem collapse. Second, when

458

ecosystems are in the vicinity of critical thresholds of collapse, critical slowing

459

causes a power-law (scale-free) behaviour but in a different metric - the spatial

460

autocovariance, or spectral function, of local densities.

461

A. Local positive feedback, clustering and resilience

462

Previous ecological models that have attempted to resolve these connections

463

include complex interactions often specific to particular ecosystems (Kéfi et al.

464

2011, 2007, Meloni et al. 2017b, Scanlon et al. 2007, Schneider and Kéfi 2016). In

465

such models, many parameters contribute to local positive feedback and environ-

466

mental stress, thus making it difficult to disentangle causal links between local

467

processes and macroscopic patterns. Here, we deliberately used a simple model

468

with only two parameters representing environmental stress and local positive

469

feedback. The simplicity of the model we employed may also be seen as a limi-

470

tation. However, it helped us conclude that loss of power-law clustering is not a

471

robust indicator of approach to ecosystem transitions. Furthermore, it allowed us

472

to disentangle the effects of environmental stress and positive feedback on clus-

473

tering and resilience. Specifically, we propose a hypothesis that distance between

474

power-law clustering (percolation threshold) and critical threshold of collapse re-

475

duces as the strength of positive feedback increases.

476

Seminal ecological models that try to explain power-law clustering observed

477

in ecosystems (Kéfi et al. 2007, Scanlon et al. 2007) assume that local births/deaths

478

of trees, in addition to being positively influenced by local density, is negatively

479

regulated by global-scale feedback. Mechanisms such as rapid spread of water in

480

the landscape (von Hardenberg et al. 2010) are offered as potential explanations

481

for negative regulation of local growth due to global-scale vegetation density.

482

Indeed, based on our synthesis ((Manor and Shnerb 2008, 2009) and Fig 6), we

483

demonstrate that there is no need to invoke global-scale feedback; in fact, local

484

positive feedback alone can explain the emergence of scale-free clustering in these

485

systems.

486

Several empirical studies find neither scale-free clustering (Weerman et al.

487

2012, Xu et al. 2015a) nor the expected shifts of cluster-size distributions with

488

increasing stress (Casey et al. 2016). However, they attribute this to an ab-

489

sence/disruption of global negative feedback in their systems (Casey et al. 2016,

490

von Hardenberg et al. 2010, Weerman et al. 2012)(but also see Moreno-de las

491

Heras et al. (2011)). As we argued in the previous paragraph, negative feed-

492

back isn’t even a necessary condition for scale-free clustering. Further, based

493

on our synthesis that cluster-sizes do not relate to resilience, we posit that these

494

empirical results are not surprising.

495

Cluster-size distributions are nevertheless relevant in ecological contexts where

496

connectivity or porosity of the landscape is of focal interest, such as in the case of

497

forest fires or disease spread (Chaves et al. 2012, Turcotte and Malamud 2004). We

498

illustrated that power-law clustering in our ecological model is associated with

499

a transition in percolation probability, representing the emergence of a spanning

500

cluster (i.e. a fully connected path) in the system. This is also seen in spatial mod-

501

els of predator-prey interactions (Roy et al. 2003). In the context of fire or disease

502

outbreaks, presence of a cluster of vegetation (susceptible individuals) allows

503

fire (disease) to easily spread within each cluster. Consequently, scale-free clus-

504

tering, which indicates a highly connected landscape, allows the possibility of

505

catastrophic fire (or disease) outbreaks. These models represent a fundamentally

506

different class of models from what we have discussed in this paper (Dickman

507

et al. 2000, Solé et al. 1999).

508

B. Cluster-sizes and Critical slowing down

509

Our synthesis predicts that scale-free behaviour in spatial correlations, mea-

510

sured via autocovariance or spectral functions, can characterise critical thresh-

511

olds. This feature, we argued, arises from the critical slowing down - i.e. slowed

512

response of ecosystems near threshold points - which is a generic feature of many

513

ecological transitions. How do scale-free correlations in density (described in V)

514

and scale-free clustering (Section III) relate to each other? They both indicate

515

emergence of large spatial scales in the system. However, they capture fun-

516

damentally different properties. Scale-free correlations in density indicate that

517

perturbations spread to large distances in ecosystems as a consequence of critical

518

slowing down. Therefore, it captures the dynamics of perturbations and hence

519

can be used to infer stability or lack thereof. In contrast, scale-free clusters indi-

520

cate the presence of large clusters, which do not correspond to dynamics of how

521

perturbations decay. Therefore, clustering properties are unrelated to resilience,

522

as we indeed demonstrate in Fig 6.

523

How efficient is it to use scale-free features of density correlations as an early

524

warning signals (EWS) of regime shifts or critical transitions (Scheffer et al. 2009)?

525

The purpose of early warning signals is to detect signatures of approach to crit-

526

ical thresholds. In that sense, computing simpler metrics of spatial autocorrela-

527

tion between neighboring sites (Dakos et al. 2010) or spatial variance (Guttal and

528

Jayaprakash 2009) may have advantages such as ease of computation and better

529

statistical reliability in comparison to characterising the complete form of autoco-

530

variance or spectral functions. On the other hand, simpler metrics are also easily

531

affected by external factors, such as increased spatial heterogeneity or external

532

variability (Dakos et al. 2010, Kéfi et al. 2014) and hence confound interpreta-

533

tions. Further investigations can reveal the relative efficacy of different spatial

534

metrics.

535

C. Future directions

536

Our synthesis suggests some exciting directions for future research. The focus

537

of recent research, as reviewed in this paper, has been to understand how local

538

interactions produce clustering properties, and how clustering properties can be

539

used to infer resilience. However, the inverse problem of inferring ecological

540

interactions from spatial images of ecosystems remains poorly studied. For ex-

541

ample, the occurrence of power-law or such heavy-tailed distributions can itself

542

be used to infer the role of local facilitative interactions in the ecosystem. Indeed,

543

one recent study does suggest that skewness of cluster-size distributions can sug-

544

gest positive feedback in dryland-vegetation systems (Xu et al. 2015a). The bigger

545

question remains open: can we quantify the strengths and spatial scales of posi-

546

tive feedback and other ecological interactions between organisms by analysis of

547

spatial images, for example via geometrical properties of clusters such as cluster

548

sizes, fractal dimensions of clusters, and the strength of spatial correlations in the

549

system.

550

With recent advancements in remote sensing and reducing costs of spatial im-

551

ages, we can also procure extensive high-resolution spatial data over time. This

552

will enable us to quantify not only patterns, as described above, but also dynam-

553

ics of various cluster properties. Unlike static properties available from a single

554

image, dynamical properties may reflect stability of ecosystems by capturing how

555

systems respond to perturbations. Theoretical works, inspired by studies of do-

556

main growth in phase transitions, describe the dynamics of clusters in simple

557

ecological models exhibiting continuous and discontinuous transitions (Manor

558

and Shnerb 2008, Weissmann et al. 2017). However, much remains to be done in

559

integrating these studies with real data. This requires extensive theoretical and

560

computational studies to identify suitable metrics of clustering properties, devel-

561

opment of statistical frameworks including appropriate spatial null models and

562

finally, empirical validations/applications based on analyses of aerial images of

563

ecosystems.

564

D. Concluding remarks

565

Our synthesis helps us disentangle processes that generate power-law cluster

566

sizes, scale-free correlations and how they relate to ecosystems’ critical thresh-

567

olds. Real world analyses however can sometimes yield misleading patterns,

568

including power-laws and scale-free behaviours due to sampling artefacts (Plank

569

and Codling 2009) or misfitting (Clauset et al. 2009, Meloni et al. 2017a, White

570

et al. 2008). Various ways in which patterns are misconstrued as power-laws

571

have been discussed in detail in multiple other forums (Breed et al. 2015, Clauset

572

et al. 2009, Stumpf and Porter 2012). Where there is a true power-law with an

573

exponent less than two, since it is indicative of diverging quantities, there is a

574

tendency to associate such a pattern with a critical phenomenon. However, scale-

575

free patterns can also arise when underlying processes operate at multiple scales

576

and due to landscape heterogeneity (Khaluf et al. 2017, Petrovskii et al. 2011).

577

Naive association of observed scale-free behaviours with either criticality or sta-

578

bility is problematic. An additional challenge in interpreting spatial patterns in

579

ecosystems is to disentangle effects of underlying spatial heterogeneity from true

580

self-organisation. With the increasing availability of high-resolution spatial datas,

581

from satellites to drone based imagery, of various ecosystems, spatial analyses are

582

likely to be widely deployed in the future. Our study highlights the importance
