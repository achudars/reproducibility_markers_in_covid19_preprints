Abstract
Mitochondria contain their own translation apparatus which enables them to produce
the polypeptides encoded in their genome. The mitochondrially-encoded RNA
components of the mitochondrial ribosome require various post-transcriptional
processing steps. Additional protein factors are required to facilitate the biogenesis of
the functional mitoribosome. We have characterised a mitochondrially-localized
protein, YbeY, which interacts with the assembling mitoribosome through the small
subunit. Loss of YbeY leads to a severe reduction in mitochondrial translation and a
loss of cell viability, caused by less accurate mitochondrial mt-tRNASer(AGY) processing
from the primary transcript and an accumulation of immature mitochondrial small
subunit. Our results suggest that YbeY performs a dual function in mitochondria
coupling tRNA processing to mitoribosome biogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) is one of the major functions of mitochondria. A
majority of the components of the OxPhos complexes are encoded in the cell nucleus
and imported into mitochondria upon translation in the cytoplasm. However, thirteen
structural polypeptides of the OxPhos complexes are translated within mitochondria.
These polypeptides are encoded in the human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) along
with the twenty-two tRNAs and two rRNAs that make up the RNA components of the
intra-organellar translation apparatus.
The mtDNA is transcribed bidirectionally, generating long polycistronic RNA strands.
In the majority of cases, mRNAs and rRNAs in the precursors are flanked by tRNA
molecules (1,2). The excision of these mt-tRNAs is performed by endonucleolytic
enzymes RNase P at the 5’ end, and RNase Z (ELAC2) at the 3’ end (3,4). This
releases the mt-mRNAs and mt-rRNAs, with the latter undergoing further maturation
and assembly into the mitochondrial ribosome.
The mammalian mitoribosome consists of a large (mt-LSU) and small subunit (mtSSU), and is composed of approximately 80 nuclear-encoded proteins, two mt-rRNAs
and one mt-tRNA (5,6). The assembly of the mitoribosome involves the chemical
modification of the mt-rRNAs, spontaneous RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions
and RNA folding, and requires the assistance of various assembly factors. These
factors include, but are not limited to, GTPases and ATP-dependent RNA helicases.
The hydrolysis of NTPs by these enzymes ensure that the mt-rRNA does not fall into
conformational traps. For example, GTPBP10 (also called ObgH2) (7,8), OBGH1 (also
called GTPBP5) (9) and MTG1 (also called GTPBP7) (10) are three conserved
GTPases that assist in the assembly of mt-LSU, and C4orf14 (11-13) and ERAL1
(14,15) are two conserved GTPases that are involved with the biogenesis of mt-SSU.
RNA helicases such as DDX28 (16) and DHX30 (17) unwind mt-rRNA coupled to the
hydrolysis of ATP. Additional factors such as MALSU1 form a trimeric complex with
L0R8F8 and mt-ACP at the intersubunit interphase preventing the association of the
immature subunits during monosome formation (18,19). The early stages of
mitoribosomal assembly occur co-transcriptionally in the nucleoid (20). The assembly
of mt-LSU can initiate on the 12S-16S mt-rRNA precursor molecule, but not the mtSSU (21). The initiation and progression of small subunit assembly may be inhibited

until a certain stage of early mt-LSU assembly is complete (8,22). Then, subsequent
steps of mitoribosome biogenesis are continued in distinct foci called RNA granules
(23,24).
In bacteria, the ribosomal RNAs are co-transcribed as a single operon. The pre-rRNA
undergoes the removal of transcribed spacer regions before the rRNA is ready for
assembly. The bacterial homolog of human YbeY is a single strand-specific
endoribonuclease that is responsible for the 3’ end processing of the SSU rRNA (2528). Depletion of the protein leads to accumulation of precursors, the loss of the SSU
and a subsequent translation defect (29,30). In addition, the protein also plays a role
in LSU rRNA and 5S rRNA maturation (26). However, recent work suggests that,
unlike other nucleases that can use immature small subunits containing precursor 16S
rRNA as substrates for nucleolytic activity, the endonucleolytic activity of purified
bacterial YbeY has not been demonstrated in vitro. Even the addition of various
combinations of known YbeY interactors, ribosome components and initiator tRNA did
not lead to expected YbeY-specific RNA cleavage events (27,31). Furthermore, it has
also been implicated in the degradation of defective and misprocessed SSU rRNA
and, as such, plays a role in ribosome quality control, in conjunction with RNase R
(26,31,32).
Very little is known about the human orthologue of bacterial YbeY. Unlike bacteria, the
16S and 12S mt-rRNA components are flanked by mt-tRNAs, and their excision by
RNase P and ELAC2, without the need for further end processing, is sufficient for
assembly into the mitochondrial ribosome (33,34). Therefore the function of
mammalian YbeY is expected to be substantially different. Recent work demonstrated
that the introduction of human YbeY into bacteria lacking the homolog caused partial
rescue of phenotype (35). However, the exact function of YbeY in mammalian
mitochondria has so far not been investigated.
We and others have recently shown that defects in the structural components of
mitoribosome and its assembly factors can lead to a human disorder of mitochondrial
respiration (36). The RNase activity of YbeY from various bacterial species (26,28,37),
plant chloroplasts (38) and the mammalian mitochondria have been previously
demonstrated. Therefore, we have focussed on the functional significance of the
protein in the mitochondria (35). Here, we show that YbeY is a mitochondrially-

localised protein. We characterise YbeY-deficient HEK293T cell lines and YbeY
knockout Hap1 cell lines. We demonstrate that the loss of the protein leads to a severe
deficiency in mitochondrial translation. We also show that YbeY has a dual function:
(i) YbeY plays a role in tRNASer(AGY) processing at both the 5’ and 3’ ends and (ii)
interacts with the mt-SSU component uS11m. The loss of YbeY causes a decrease in
the abundance of mt-SSU components and an increase in mt-LSU component
abundance. Furthermore, in YbeY knockout cells, mt-SSU and mt-LSU fail to
effectively assembly into a monosome. These findings on the role of YbeY provide
new insights into the mitoribosome assembly process and, in the long-term, can help
pave the way for the development of future mechanism-based therapies for
mitochondrial diseases.

RESULTS
YbeY is a mitochondrial protein with a conserved endonuclease domain
Human YbeY is an uncharacterised protein that is encoded by the C21orf57 gene. It
belongs to the UPF0054 protein family (PFAM accession number: PF02130) which
contains a highly conserved zinc ion-coordinating consensus motif H3XH5XH (39).
The bacterial homolog is an active endoribonuclease and contains the RNA-binding
Arg59 residue and the histidine triad (26,32). Sequence alignment from multiple
species (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1) and homology modelling of human
YbeY, using the E. coli protein as the template, revealed strong conservation,
especially of the aforementioned active site residues, suggesting that human YbeY is
an active RNase (Figure 1B). In addition, the previous analysis showed that E. coli
Asp85 (Asp90 H. sapiens), found in the beta-sheet outside the active site and required
for the interaction of YbeY with the ribosomal small subunit component, S11, is also
conserved. Mutation of these residues has been shown to disrupt nuclease activity of
the protein and rRNA maturation (35) (Supplementary Figure 1). Further comparison
of the two homologs also shows that human YbeY has a nine amino acid insertion
(Gly75-Pro83) between two conserved beta sheets which is conserved in other
eukaryotic species (Supplementary Figure 1) and may be responsible for additional
protein interactions and additional functions in the mitochondria (Figure 1B) (35).
YbeY has been previously predicted to be mitochondrially localised by large-scale
databases, MitoCarta 2.0 and MitoMiner 4.0 (40,41). Furthermore. large-scale
CRISPR/Cas9 screen has revealed that YbeY is vital for OXPHOS function (42). In
accordance with these results, in silico analysis of the subcellular localisation of the
protein by multiple online tools predicted a high probability of mitochondrial
localisation: Predotar (43) - 0.87, TargetP (44) - 0.86, and Mitoprot (45) - 0.96. To
confirm these predictions, we used immunostaining that showed a co-localisation of
transiently-expressed flag/strep2-tagged YbeY to the mitochondria in HeLa cells
(Figure 1C). We also used subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting to localise
endogenous YbeY in the cell. YbeY co-fractionated with inner membrane-localised
Complex I subunit, NDUFS1 (Figure 1D). To assess, if YbeY co-localises within
mitochondrial RNA granules (MRGs), where processing of nascent RNA occurs,
immunocytochemistry was performed using antibodies against a MRG marker GRSF1

(46). While the MRGs appeared as distinct puncta, YbeY was distributed throughout
the mitochondria (Supplementary Figure S2). Taken together, this confirms that
YbeY is a mitochondrial protein but does not co-localise within MRGs.

YbeY is required for mitochondrial translation
In order to investigate the role of YbeY, we inactivated its expression in human cells.
YbeY-deficient HEK293T cell lines were generated using zinc finger nuclease
targeting exon 2, whereas YbeY knockout Hap1 cells were created by CRISPR/Cas9.
The hemizygous HEK293T knockout - hereby referred to as YbeY (-/m) - contained
three out-of-frame deletions and one allele with a 12 bp deletion and a change in 4
amino acids (Supplementary Figure S3A). In the heterozygous HEK293T mutant
(YbeY (+/-)), three alleles contained indels which led to premature stop codons, while
one allele contained an in-frame deletion leading to a loss of two amino acids (Figure
3B). We also used a near haploid, Hap1, YbeY knockout (YbeY (-/-)) cell line that
contained a 13 bp insertion (Supplementary Figure S3C) which produced a
premature stop codon and leads to an 80 amino acid truncated protein. All three YbeYdeficient cell lines exhibited severely depleted levels of endogenous protein (Figure
2A, B).
Next, we intended to study the OXPHOS function and mitochondrial translation upon
ablation of YbeY. Western blot analysis showed a strong reduction in the steady state
levels of Complex I and IV subunits in YbeY(-/m) cells (Figure 2A). A much stronger
effect was observed in the complete knockout cell line where, in addition to Complex
I and IV, a Complex III subunit was also depleted, suggesting a defect in synthesis of
the OXPHOS subunits in the absence of YbeY. Consistent with this result, cell growth
was compromised when YbeY-deficient HEK293 cells were grown in media containing
galactose as the sole carbon source, forcing them to rely on mitochondrial ATP
production (Figure 2C). The growth of Hap1 YbeY-deficient cells was compromised
on standard, glucose-containing medium while the cells failed to grow on medium
containing galactose as the sole carbon source (Figure 2D). The effect of YbeY
depletion on mitochondrial translation was assessed using in vivo incorporation of
[35S]-methionine into newly synthesised proteins. A global mitochondrial translation
defect was observed in the YbeY(-/-) cells, while a reduction of protein synthesis was

observed in the YbeY(-/m) cells (Figure 2E, F). Moreover, in YbeY-deficient HEK293T
cells, the higher molecular weight translation products were affected to a greater
degree than the lower molecular weight products (Supplementary Figure S4A). This
loss of translation was mitochondria-specific and not caused as a by-product of
reduced cytoplasmic translation (Supplementary Figure S4B). Taken together, these
result show that YbeY is indispensable for mitochondrial translation.

YbeY is required for accurate mt-tRNASer(AGY) processing
In E. coli, YbeY is required for endonucleolytic processing of the rRNA precursors (32).
Thus, we set out to investigate if the endonucleolytic function of human YbeY has a
role in controlling mitochondrial transcript steady state level. Northern blot analysis
showed that there was no difference in the levels of the 12S and 16S mt-rRNAs
(Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure S5A). Any observed increase in mt-mRNAs
coding for Complex I subunit ND1 and ND2 steady state levels and a decrease in mtmRNAs encoding Complex IV subunit CO1 and CO2 (Figure 3A, Supplementary
Figure S5A) was not attributed to YbeY deficiency, as a similar compensatory
phenotype has been often observed in cells responding to defective mitochondrial
translation (47-50).
Further analysis of mitochondrial tRNA using high resolution northern blotting showed
a potential steady-state decrease and/or processing defect of mt-tRNASer(AGY) relative
to other mt-tRNAs analysed (Figure 3B). Given that bacterial YbeY is predominantly
involved in rRNA end processing, we wanted to investigate the effects of YbeY
knockout on the 5’ and 3’ ends of the mt-rRNAs and mt-tRNAs to see if YbeY plays a
similar role in the mammalian mitochondria. To do so, we used circularisation RT-PCR
to ligate the 5’ end of the RNA molecule to the 3’ end and sequence the junction. No
significant difference was observed in the 5’ and 3’ processing of mt-tRNAIle, mttRNALeu(UUR), 12S mt-rRNA and 16S mt-rRNA when Hap1 parental cells and YbeY
knockout cells were compared (Figure 4A, B). However, in YbeY knockout Hap1 cells,
only ~1 % of the mt-tRNASer(AGY) molecules were correctly cleaved from the primary
transcript and modified to add the 3’ CCA, as compared to the ~85 % in the control
Hap1 cells (Figure 4A). Sequence analysis of the mt-tRNA processing in the YbeY
knockout cells revealed that only ~ 20 % of mt-tRNASer(AGY) were correctly processed

from the 5’ terminus and ~64 % from the 3’ end (Figure 4C, D). This confirms that
YbeY is indispensable for the correct end processing of mt-tRNASer(AGY).

YbeY interacts with mitochondrial ribosomal components
In order to study a potential interaction of human YbeY with the mitoribosomal
subunits, we used western blot analysis after sucrose gradient fractionation. A majority
of YbeY was found in the “free” fractions (fractions 1-4). However, a small proportion
co-migrated with the mt-SSU, suggesting potential weak interaction of YbeY with this
subunit (Figure 5A). Next, in order to identify interactors of human YbeY with a higher
sensitivity, we used quantitative SILAC-based immunoaffinity purification of flagtagged YbeY. This experiment identified various mt-SSU and mt-LSU components
being pulled-down with YbeY. The strongest interactor of YbeY appeared to be
uS11m. Other interactors of YbeY included ERAL1 and mitoribosomal proteins such
as uL2m, uL4m, bL20m, bL21m, mL42, mL43, mL50, mL64 and mS26 (Figure 5B,
Supplementary Figure S6). The interaction with uS11 and ERAL1 is highly
conserved in bacteria and vital for the maturation of the small subunit (51). These
results show conserved interactions of YbeY with the ribosome and, hence, a
potentially conserved role in ribosome biogenesis between bacteria and human
mitochondria.
Loss of YbeY impairs mitoribosome assembly
In E. coli, YbeY is responsible for ribosomal quality control. With the assistance of
exonuclease RNase R, bacterial YbeY degrades rRNA from late stage ribosome
assembly intermediates with defective small subunits (26,32). Hence, we intended to
investigate the effect of YbeY depletion on the mitoribosome integrity. Western blot
showed a decrease in the steady state levels of mt-SSU components, while the
steady-state levels of mt-LSU remained largely unchanged, as compared to a control
(Supplementary Figure S7A). To further verify this, we performed western blot
analysis after sucrose gradient fractionation. Again, we observed a decrease in
abundance of the assembled mt-SSU, with a large proportion of mt-SSU (measured
by the abundance of uS17m) being present in the earlier ‘free protein’ fractions
(Supplementary Figure S7B-C). To quantitatively assess changes in composition
and integrity of the mitoribosome in the YbeY knockout cells, we used isokinetic

sucrose gradient fractionation in combination with SILAC and quantitative mass
spectrometry. These experiments confirmed that mt-SSU was strongly decreased in
the YbeY knockout cells (Figure 6A, C), while mt-LSU was more abundant in the
knockout cells relative to the control (Figure 6B, D). A comparison of the ratio of
assembled mt-SSU and mt-LSU subunits to the monosome implies that in cells lacking
YbeY, a larger proportion of both subunits is not assembled into the monosome
(Figure 6E). Taken together these experiments indicate a problem in mt-SSU
assembly/stability preventing correct formation of the monosome in mitochondria.

DISCUSSION
The translation of the mitochondrially-encoded polypeptides requires the coordinated
action of numerous factors. Many of these factors act at the RNA level such as
cleaving the primary transcript, chemically modifying mt-tRNAs and mt-rRNAs, or
chaperoning the mt-rRNA into the correct conformation (52). Here, we have identified
YbeY, a mitochondrially-localised protein with a conserved endonucleolytic domain.
Deletion of the gene led to decreased steady state levels of the OxPhos complexes
which have mitochondrially-encoded components. Moreover, analysis of de novo
mitochondrial protein synthesis showed that YbeY depletion had a detrimental effect
on ribosome activity.
The main catalytic residues involved in endonucleolytic cleavage, are conserved in
mammalian YbeY suggesting the conservation of its endonucleolytic function (35).
Moreover, YbeY has been shown to be an active RNase in various bacterial species
(26,28,37) and in plant chloroplasts (38). In E. coli, similar to the mitochondria, the
ribosomal RNAs are initially transcribed within a primary transcript and are later
released through multiple hierarchical cleavage events. Bacterial YbeY is responsible
for the 5’ and 3’ end maturation of the 16S (small subunit rRNA) precursor, the 5’ end
maturation of the 23S (large subunit rRNA) precursor and the final steps of 5S rRNA
maturation (32). In the mammalian mitochondria, however, the excision of the flanking
mt-tRNAs by RNase P and ELAC2 produces the mt-rRNAs ready for mitochondrial
assembly. Thus, to investigate if the translation defect was due to errors in RNA
processing, we investigated the effect of YbeY depletion on RNA steady state levels.
We observed no difference in mRNA and rRNA levels or processing, however, there
was a noticeable decrease in the mt-tRNASer(AGY) and in mt-tRNALeu(UUR) to a lesser
extent. Analysis of the 5’ and 3’ termini of the tRNAs showed that a severe deficiency
in accurate post-transcriptional processing of mt-tRNASer(AGY) from the primary
transcript in YbeY-deficient cells.
In addition to RNA processing, the bacterial YbeY degrades rRNA from late state
ribosomes with defective small subunits and as such is responsible for quality control
(26,32). We show that, in the mammalian mitochondria, YbeY is crucial for the integrity
of the small subunit. Similar to the bacterial homolog, YbeY may perform its ribosomeassociated function through its interaction with the uS11m and ERAL1. Analysis of

interactors of the human YbeY showed that it interacts with uS11m and ERAL1, both
key components of mt-SSU biogenesis, suggesting a role for YbeY in mitoribosomal
biogenesis similar to its role in bacteria. The GTPase ERAL1 is a 12S mt-rRNA
chaperone and mt-SSU assembly factor (14). In bacteria, the homolog of YbeY
interacts with ribosomal protein S11 (homolog of mitoribosomal component uS11m)
and GTPase Era (homolog of 12S mt-rRNA methyltransferase, ERAL1). However, the
interaction with Era is facilitated indirectly through its interaction with S11, which
explains the weak interaction of ERAL1 with YbeY. A disruption of this YbeY-S11
interaction in bacteria led to an accumulation of 16S small subunit rRNA precursors
and a resultant increase in susceptibility to stress (51). The residues involved with the
YbeY-S11 interaction are conserved in human YbeY (51). Therefore, this suggests
that, similar to its bacterial homolog, YbeY associates with ERAL1 indirectly through
uS11m. Both ERAL1 and its bacterial homolog Era binds stem-loop structures at the
3’ end of the SSU rRNA (14,15). In mammalian 12S mt-rRNA, this stem-loop region
contains two adenines that are methylated by TFB1M, and this modification is
necessary for ERAL1 activity (15). The progression of mt-SSU assembly requires the
removal and targeted degradation of ERAL1 from this site (53). Structural analysis of
the mitochondrial ribosome suggests that, similar to the bacterial ribosome, the uS11m
component is assembled at the 3’ end of the SSU mt-rRNA, at the site of ERAL1
interaction.
Mitochondrial uS11m has extensive connections with the 12S mt-rRNA and binds
independently to other protein clusters during the assembly process (23). However,
previously published pulse-chase quantitative proteomic analysis of small subunit
assembly in bacteria and human cells have demonstrated that while the mitochondrial
uS11m subunit is an early binding protein, S11 is one of the last proteins to be
assembled into the bacterial SSU (23,54). In addition to uS11m, YbeY interactors also
included mS26, mL64, uL2 and early-assembly mt-LSU clusters, bL20m-bL21mmL42-mL43-mL44 and uL4m-mL50 (23). Mapping these components onto the
mitoribosomal structures show that these subcomplexes form a continuous belt of
proteins around the large subunit and have extensive contacts with the 16S mt-rRNA
(Supplementary Figure S6). However, these interactions with the mt-LSU
subcomplexes are weak and might not be direct interactions, but secondary
interactions via rRNA or other proteins.

The assembly of mt-SSU and mt-LSU can be inextricably linked. It has been previously
shown that defects in the assembly of the large subunit have negative consequences
for the assembly of the small subunit (7,8). The knockout of YbeY leads to a severe
depletion of mt-SSU. We speculate that this impaired assembly of mt-SSU is
associated with compensatory accumulation of mt-LSU, owing to perturbed
monosome formation. This partly explains the loss in mitochondrial translation in YbeY
deficient cells. How this compensatory upregulation of mt-LSU is executed and
whether or not it involves sensing of the mt-SSU assembly status, need further
investigation.
Alongside its role in mitoribosomal biogenesis, we also demonstrate that YbeY is
required for the accurate post-transcriptional processing of mt-tRNASer(AGY). The
residues required for endonucleolytic cleavage are conserved in YbeY. However,
there is no indication of endonucleolytic processing of mt-rRNA during mitoribosomal
biogenesis. Normally, the 5’ end of RNAs in the mitochondrial primary transcripts is
processed by RNase P before the 3’ end processing by RNase Z (3,21). However,
previous work has suggested that mt-tRNASer(AGY) is not processed completely at the
5’ end by RNase P (55). The authors suggested that the release of the 5’ end of the
mt-tRNA is a consequence of the 3’ endonucleolytic processing of the upstream mttRNAHis, while the presence of the downstream mt-tRNALeu(UUR) was dispensable for
mt-tRNASer(AGY) 3’ end processing (55). Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of RNase
P-deficient MRPP3 knockout mice show that mt-tRNASer(AGY) is not affected by the lack
of RNase P (21) while the presence of ELAC2 is required for the processing of mttRNASer(AGY) as loss of the enzyme leads to accumulation of unprocessed precursors
(56). Here, we demonstrate that in the absence of YbeY, steady state levels of mttRNASer(AGY) are reduced, and the 5’ and to a lesser extend the 3’ ends of mttRNASer(AGY) are erroneously processed. However, a small proportion of correctly
processed mt-tRNAs are still produced and can be used in translation. We suggest
that YbeY works in conjunction with, but independently from, ELAC2 to accurately
cleave the mt-tRNA at the 3’ end of the upstream mt-tRNAHis and at the 3’ end of mttRNASer(AGY). The mechanism by which this is performed is currently unclear and
remains to be elucidated.
Fractionation experiments are consistent with early mt-LSU assembly and a majority
of mt-SSU assembly occurring in the nucleoid (mtDNA containing fractions) after

which mitoribosome assembly continues in MRGs, the latter being based on colocalisation experiments (12,20,22-24). Our data suggests that YbeY contributes to
late assembly of mt-SSU. However, previously published proteomic analysis of
nucleoid-associated proteins did not identify YbeY as a constituent of nucleoids (20)
and our results indicate that YbeY does not localise to MRGs. The distribution of YbeY
in the mitochondrial matrix may be as a result of its multiple functions in mitochondria.
Many mitochondrial RNA binding proteins, such as MRPP1, MRPP2 and NSUN4,
have multiple independent functions in RNA modification (57-60). Our results have
demonstrated that YbeY, similarly performs multiple functions in the mammalian
mitochondria. As such, it may act as a link between the post-transcriptional processing
of the primary transcript, and mitoribosomal biogenesis and translation. Moreover, our
results also highlight a possible connection between the assembly pathways of the
large and small mitoribosomal subunits, where the negative effects on the assembly
of the small subunit may have a knock-on effect on the large subunit.

Cell culture
Cell lines were maintained at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in humidified incubators. The
HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM), containing 4.5 g/L glucose, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, supplemented with
10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Hap1
cells were cultured in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) containing 4.5 g/L
glucose, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine
serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. IMDM for YbeY knockout Hap1
cells were supplemented with 20% FBS. Flp-In T-Rex HEK293T cells were cultured in
supplemented DMEM with additional 15 µg/ml blasticidin and 100 µg/ml Zeocin. After
transfection with pcDNA/FRT/TO plasmid, the cells were cultured in supplemented
DMEM containing 4.5 g/L glucose, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, supplemented with
10% (v/v) tetracycline-free foetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin, 15 µg/ml blasticidin and 50 µg/ml hygromycin.
Transfection
2 µg of DNA and 3 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 were incubated in 100 µl of optiMEM
separately for 5 minutes at room temperature. They were mixed and incubated for a
further 10 minutes. Then, they were added to cells in supplemented DMEM and mixed
by swirling.
Immunodetection of proteins
A confluent 9 cm dish of HEK293T or Hap1 cells (or isolated mitochondria) were
washed with PBS and pelleted at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes. The pellet was lysed with
Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 1 x Roche
inhibitor tablet) on ice for 15 minutes and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes. The
protein concentration of the supernatant was quantified. 25 µg of lysate was boiled at
95 °C with 33.3 % NuPAGE LDS 4x sample buffer containing 200 mM DTT. The boiled

solution was run on a 4-12% Bis-Tris NuPage polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 30
minutes. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane with the iBlot
2 Dry Blotting System using Protocol ‘P0’. Gels were stained with SimplyBlue
Safestain. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBS-T at room
temperature. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary
antibody diluted in 5% milk in PBS-T. The membrane was washed 3 times for 10
minutes with PBS-T. The membrane was incubated with secondary antibody diluted
in PBS-T and then washed again as before. Finally, the membrane was developed
using ECL and X-ray film.

Mitochondrial Isolation and cell fractionation
Mitochondria were isolated using a cell homogeniser (isobiotec) as described by (61).
For cell fractionation, the mitochondrial isolation protocol using a Dounce homogeniser
adapted from (62) was used. Briefly, 15 confluent 15 cm dishes of HEK293T cells were
washed with 1 x PBS and pelleted. The cell pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of
mitobuffer (0.6 M mannitol, 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) containing 0.1%
BSA. 100 µl of the cell suspension was kept aside as the ‘total fraction’. The
suspension was homogenised in a Dounce homogeniser (15 strokes). The
homogenised suspension was centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes. The pellet was
resuspended in mitobuffer containing BSA and re-homogenised. The supernatant was
used as the ‘debris fraction’. The supernatant was centrifuged at 400 g for 5 minutes.
The supernatant from this step was centrifuged at 11,000 g. The supernatant from this
step was kept aside as the ‘cytoplasmic fraction’. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml
of mitobuffer containing 50 U/ml Benzonase, incubated on ice for 15 minutes and
centrifuged at 11,000 g for 10 minutes. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in
120 µl of mitobuffer and divided into two aliquots. The first aliquot was the
mitochondrial fraction. The second aliquot was incubated with 4 µg/mg of Proteinase
K for 30 minutes on ice (proteinase K fraction). The aliquots were centrifuged at 11,000
g for 5 minutes. The pellet was lysed, and all fractions were analysed by western
blotting.
Immunocytochemistry
The cells were grown on coverslips in a well of a 6-well plate. 24 hours after
transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with 4 %
formaldehyde diluted in PBS for 15 minutes. The cells were then washed with PBS
and then permeabilised for 5 minutes with 0.1% Triton-X diluted in PBS. The cells were
incubated for 1 hour in PBSS (5% FBS v/v, 95% PBS) and then for 1.5 hours in primary
antibody diluted in PBSS. The cells were washed three times for 5 minutes in PBSS.
Secondary antibody, diluted in PBSS, was added to the cells and incubated for 1 hour.
Following the incubation, the cells were washed (5 minutes each) twice in PBSS and
once in PBS and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium. The cells were visualised
by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope.

Circularisation RT-PCR sequencing
For the analysis of the 5’ and 3’ ends of certain mt-tRNAs and mt-rRNAs, the protocol
was adapted from (48). In brief, the RNA was circularised and reverse transcribed
across the ligated junction. PCR was used to amplify the product, which was then
cloned using a Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit and sequenced using an M13 forward
universal sequencing primer.

S-methionine metabolic labelling of de novo protein synthesis

Newly synthesised mitochondrial proteins in Hap1 and HEK293T cell lines were
labelled with

35

S-labelled methionine and analysed by autoradiography as described

by (63).
Quantitative immunoprecipitation
Doxycycline-inducible YbeY.FLAG-expressing cells were grown in heavy (15N and 13C
labelled Arg and Lys containing medium) and light (14N and

12

C Arg and Lys (Sigma

Aldrich) containing medium) SILAC medium. Cells were differentially induced with 100
ng/ml doxycycline for 24 hours. The four conditions (heavy induced, heavy uninduced,
light induced, light uninduced) were harvested, pelleted at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes,
washed with PBS and re-pelleted. The cells were quantified and mixed in equal
proportion (heavy induced with light uninduced, and heavy uninduced with light
induced). Mitochondria were isolated (see Mitochondrial isolation section) from the cell
suspension. Mitochondria were lysed and immunoaffinity purification was carried out
with FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Elution was performed with FLAG peptide. The interactors were measured using mass
spectrometry and the interactors were separated into ‘induced’ and ‘uninduced’ based

on isotope labelling (see Mass spectrometry and analysis of SILAC samples section).
After protein concentration and labelling were computationally identified. The
reciprocal of the protein orientation was calculated for the reverse labelling orientation.
Ratios for both the samples and a base two logarithm were calculated. The data was
plotted on an X-Y scatter plot.
Quantitative isokinetic sucrose gradient analysis of mitoribosomes
6 x 15 cm dishes of Hap1 control and YbeY (-/-) Hap1 cells were grown in heavy (15N
and

13

C labelled Arg and Lys containing medium) and light (14N and

12

C Arg and Lys

(Sigma Aldrich) containing medium) SILAC medium respectively. The cells pelleted at
1200 rpm for 3 minutes, washed with PBS and re-pelleted. The cells were
resuspended in 20 ml of PBS, quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit as per
manufacturer’s instructions and the two cell suspensions were mixed in equal
proportions. The cells were pelleted and mitochondria were isolated (see
Mitochondrial isolation section). The mitochondrial pellet was incubated on ice with
100 µl of lysis buffer for 15 minutes and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 °C.
750 µg of the lysate was run on a 10-30% isokinetic sucrose gradient as described in
(63). 100 µl fractions were taken and run 4 mm into a 4-12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide
gel to remove the sucrose. The gel was stained for 1 hour with SimplyBlue Safestain
and destained for 1 hour (20% methanol, 10% acetic acid). The stained 4 mm region
was cut and analysed by mass spectrometry. The Hap1 and YbeY(-/-) proteins were
separated by their SILAC labelling.
Mass spectrometry and analysis of SILAC samples
The peptides were analysed with LC-MS/MS on a Thermo Scientific Oribitrap LTQ XL
spectrometer with a nanospray inlet interface coupled with Proxeon EasynLC nano
chromatography. The internal ‘lock mass’ standard of 445.120 m/z was used for
accurate mass measurements. Samples were run from the earliest fraction to the
latest without intervening washes to maintain chromatographic conditions between
washes. To identify peptides, resulting data files were processed using Proteome
Discoverer software (ThermoFisher Scientific). The resulting spectra from the RAW
file were submitted to the in-house Mascot server and peptides were assigned using
the Uniprot Homo sapiens protein database, specifying parameters for use of trypsin
digest of the gel pieces, allowing for the possibility of one uncleaved lysine and

arginine residue per peptide, allowing for peptides to carry a deviation of 10 ppm
around calculated peptide values to allow matches with experimentally observed
values, and fragment size was set at 0.5 Da. A multiconsensus report was generated
following the quantification of each identified peptide using Protein Discoverer,
allowing the relative quantification of proteins to be obtained from the relative
quantification of peptides. The mean value of the three most abundant peptides for
each protein was used as a representative value for that protein. This was performed
for fraction and a profile for each protein for each fraction was determined.
For SILAC samples, proteins were identified using the ANDROMEDA algorithm of the
MAXQUANT software package by comparing the proteins to the human UniProt
database. The peptide information from both sets were combined and filtered using
the PERSEUS software, removing proteins only identified by site, that matched a
decoy peptide database and contaminating peptides. Proteins identified by two or
fewer peptides were removed. Proteins identified from only one of the two cell lines
were removed from the final protein dataset. Heavy label incorporation was performed
by manually processing peptide information of the heavy-only sample by MAXQUANT.
The maximum intensity for each of the proteins in the two samples was marked as the
maximum value and the remaining intensity profile of that protein was scales
proportional to this value.
RNA isolation and northern blotting
RNA was extracted from HEK293T and Hap1 cell lines with TRIzol reagent
(ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Northern blot was
performed as described by (62) with minor modifications. Total RNA was resolved on
a 6% or a 15% urea-PAGE gel (for mt-tRNAs). After wet transfer of the RNA to a nylon
membrane (Magnoprobe, 0.45 µ; GE Healthcare or Genescreenplus, NEN DuPont) in
2 x SSC (150 nM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate pH 7.0), the membrane was subjected
to UV-crosslinking (0.12 J). High resolution tRNA gels were dry blotted using the ‘rapid
transfer method’ (Reference). The membranes were hybridised overnight at 65 °C with
radioactive probes in 7% SDS and 0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), washed
with SSC (containing 0.1% SDS) five times for 20 minutes. The membrane was
exposed to a storage phosphor screen (GE Healthcare), visualised using a Typhoon
phosphorimaging system and quantified using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij).

Figure 6 | Assembly of mt- SSU is perturbed in YbeY knockout cells
(A, B) Quantitative sucrose gradient fractionation of mtSSU (A) and mtLSU (B).
Sucrose gradient fractionation was performed with mitochondria from SILAC labelled
parental and YbeY knockout Hap1 cell. The fractions were analysed using mass
spectrometry. A heatmap was generated from the intensity of detection of peptides
common to both samples. The intensity profile was scaled relative to the maximum
intensity. Each row represents a different large subunit component.
(C, D) The average abundance of the mt-SSU (C) and mt-LSU (D) components in
the sucrose gradient.
(E) The proportion of protein components in assembled mt-SSU or mtLSU relative to
those found in monosomes was calculated for the Hap1 control cells and the YbeY
knockout cells. The abundance of the MRPs in the free mt-SSU (fractions 6-8), the
mt-LSU (fractions 8-10) and the monosome (fraction 12) was calculated relative to
the total mitoribosomal protein. Then, the proportion of free small or large subunit to
the assembled monosome was calculated for the Hap1 parental and YbeY (-/-) cells.

Supplementary Figure S1 (related to Figure 1) | Sequence conservation in YbeY
The YbeY amino acid sequences of various species were aligned using Clustal Omega tool. The
catalytically-important RNA-binding arginine is indicated with a box and an asterisk above. Green circles
indicate histidine residues from the zinc ion-binding H3H5XH motif. Asp90 (equivalent of Asp85 in E.
coli), found in the beta-sheet outside the active site and required for the interaction of YbeY with the
ribosomal SSU component S11 is indicated in orange. Eukaryote-specific insertion is indicated in blue.

Supplementary Figure S2 (related to Figure 1) | Investigating YbeY colocalization in
mitochondrial RNA granules using immunocytochemistry.
Flag-tagged YbeY was transiently expressed in HeLa cells and visualised using anti-flag antibodies
and visualised using secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa fluor 488 (green, left). RNA granules
were stained using antibodies against GRSF1 (red, middle). Co-localisation is shown in yellow. The
white scale bar at the bottom depicts 10 µm.

Supplementary figure S3 (related to Figure 2) | Genome modifications of the YbeY locus.
PCR products from candidates were cloned into pCR4 vectors using Zero Blunt TOPO cloning kit and
bacterial colonies were picked and sent for Sanger sequencing. Indels at the ZFN target sites
(depicted in red) are shown. (A) Four alleles of YbeY were identified in YbeY(-/m) clone (B) Five
alleles of YbeY were identified in YbeY(+/-) clone. The wild type sequence is above in the pair of
sequences. The Start codon is in bold. The zinc finger nuclease target site is coloured orange. (C) A
single allele is present in the YbeY(-/-) Hap1 cells.

Supplementary Figure 4 (related to Figure 2). Mitochondrial translation in YbeY-deficient cells.
(A) Quantification of mitochondrial translation products relative to the expected size of the
polypeptide. Relative metabolic labelling of the polypeptides was quantified from the intensity of the
bands using ImageJ, measured relative to the control wild type sample. The bands specific for CO2
and CO3, CYTB and ND2, CO1 and ND4 were quantified together due to their proximity on the gel.
The average mass of both proteins was calculated. The line represents the linear regression.
YbeY(+/-) R2=0.46, YbeY(-/m) R2=0.77
(B) Metabolic labelling of mitochondrial translation products in Hap1 parental cells and YbeY knockout
cells in the presence and absence of cytoplasmic inhibitor, emetine, and mitochondrial inhibitor,
chloramphenicol. Coomassie Blue staining (CBS) was used as loading control.
