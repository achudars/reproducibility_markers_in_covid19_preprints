Summary

23

During oocyte maturation, changes in gene expression depend exclusively on translation

24

and degradation of maternal mRNAs rather than transcription. Execution of this translation

25

program is essential for assembling the molecular machinery required for meiotic progression,

26

fertilization, and embryo development. With the present study, we used a RiboTag/RNA-Seq

27

approach to explore the timing of maternal mRNA translation in quiescent oocytes as well as in

28

oocytes progressing through the first meiotic division. This genome-wide analysis reveals a global

29

switch in maternal mRNA translation coinciding with oocyte re-entry into the meiotic cell cycle.

30

Messenger RNAs whose translation is highly active in quiescent oocytes invariably become

31

repressed during meiotic re-entry, whereas transcripts repressed in quiescent oocytes become

32

activated. Experimentally, we have defined the exact timing of the switch, the repressive function

33

of CPE elements, and identified a novel role for CPEB1 in maintaining constitutive translation of

34

a large group of maternal mRNAs during maturation.

Introduction

38

Cell development relies on elaborate changes in gene expression in order to transition

39

through different phenotypic and functional stages that ultimately lead to terminal differentiation.

40

Changes in gene expression are achieved through transcriptional and post-transcriptional

41

regulations. Although transcriptional regulation is understood in considerable detail(Chen and

42

Dent, 2014; Klemm et al., 2019), much less is known about the molecular machinery involved in

43

translation regulation.

44

Large oligomeric complexes involving proteins and non-coding RNAs are assembled on

45

the mRNA (Rissland, 2017) to regulate its interaction with ribosomes, its translation rate, and its

46

stability (Rissland et al., 2017; Wu and Brewer, 2012). In somatic cells, numerous observations

47

indicate that translation is intimately coupled with degradation of mRNAs (Jonas and Izaurralde,

48

2015; Wu and Brewer, 2012). Proteins recruited to the mRNA interact with elements located

49

throughout the length of the transcript (Cheng et al., 2017; Rissland, 2017). However, complexes

50

nucleated around the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) play a predominant role in translation

51

and stabilization, often by controlling the length of the poly(A) tail, which is present in most mRNAs

52

(Jacobson and Peltz, 1996; Rissland et al., 2017). In gametes and embryos, particularly, the

53

poly(A) tail determines the translation rate and stability of a mRNA (Clarke, 2012; Radford et al.,

54

2008; Richter and Lasko, 2011; Subtelny et al., 2014; Tay et al., 2000; Yartseva and Giraldez,

55

2015).

56

Germ cells are unique in their properties as they progressively acquire specialized function

57

during development (Clarke, 2012). At the same time, they maintain traits that allow for rapid

58

transition to totipotency (Seydoux and Braun, 2006). Throughout development, germ cells often

59

rely on unique post-transcriptional regulations rather than on transcription itself (Clarke, 2012;

60

Kimble and Crittenden, 2007). Striking examples of this property are the growth and maturation

61

stages of an oocyte and its transition to zygote and early embryo (Clarke, 2012; Yartseva and

3

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/685594; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

62

Giraldez, 2015). During the growth phase, oocytes amass large number of maternal mRNAs

63

through high transcriptional activity. These mRNAs are either used immediately to synthesis

64

proteins involved in growth or are stored for future use. Indeed in all species studied, transcription

65

ceases when an oocyte is fully grown and resumes only in the embryo. Thus, critical steps in

66

oocyte maturation and early embryo development rely exclusively on a program of maternal

67

mRNA translation.

68

Some properties of the molecular machinery involved in maternal mRNA translation

69

repression or activation have been elucidated in model organisms (Kimble and Crittenden, 2007;

70

Tadros and Lipshitz, 2005; Yartseva and Giraldez, 2015). In frogs, the cytoplasmic

71

polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) is considered a master regulator of

72

polyadenylation and translation (Mendez and Richter, 2001; Richter, 2007). Much less is known

73

about the role of CPEB in mammalian oocytes. Here, we have used a genome-wide approach to

74

investigate the role of this RNA-binding protein (RBP) during the transition from quiescence to re-

75

entry into the meiosis. Through a detailed time course, we have investigated the temporal

76

association between maternal mRNA translation and the different steps involved in oocyte re-

77

entry into and progression through the meiosis. Using a RiboTag/RNA-Seq strategy, we describe

78

a genome-wide switch in the translation program of maternal mRNAs, and define new, critical

79

functions of CPEB in the control of this switch.

Results

81

Re-entry into meiosis coincides with rapid translational changes of stable mRNAs

82

We have used a RiboTag/RNA-Seq strategy to characterize mRNA translation in oocytes

83

arrested at prophase I (GV) and in those undergoing meiotic maturation. (Fig. 1a). This strategy

84

has been previously validated (Martins et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017) and additional quality

85

controls are reported here (Supplementary Fig. 1a-d). Upon meiotic resumption, there were both

86

progressive increases and decreases in ribosome loading of maternal mRNAs (Fig. 1b). By late

87

metaphase I (MI), mRNAs were either constitutively translated (n = 4284, CONSTITUTIVE),

88

translationally repressed (n = 1722, DOWN), or translationally activated (n = 1537, UP) (FDR ≤

89

0.05, Supplementary Fig. 1e). Total mRNA levels remained stable up to MI and significant

90

destabilization was detectable only for 3% of maternal mRNAs at late MI (Fig. 1b and

91

Supplementary Fig. 1f). Comparison of changes in total mRNA levels (transcriptome) to changes

92

in ribosome-associated mRNA levels (translatome) confirms this late MI destabilization (Fig. 1c),

93

which became prominent later during MII arrest, with a subset of mRNAs remaining stable even

94

if their translation was repressed. Changes in translation that initiate during MI were extended into

95

and amplified at MII (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, there is a strong, positive correlation between

96

translational changes at late MI and MII (Supplementary Fig. 1g). Therefore, the patterns of

97

differential ribosome loading are consistent across multiple in vitro and in vivo biological replicates

98

and across two distinct detection platforms.

99

We compared the maternal mRNAs that are translational repressed and those that are

100

degraded in our dataset with those stabilized in mouse oocytes depleted of YTHDF2 (Ivanova et

101

al., 2017), a RNA m(6)A reader, or CNOT6L (Horvat et al., 2018), a component of the CCR4

102

complex, and found little overlap (Supplementary Fig. 2a-d). We do, however, observe overlap

103

between our data and those mRNAs that are stabilized in MII in BTG4 -/- mouse oocytes

104

(Supplementary Fig. 2e and f), confirming that repressed mRNAs are eventually destabilized.

105

BTG4 is a member of the TOB family of proteins that interacts with CNOT7/8 and is required for

106

mRNA destabilization in MII (Liu et al., 2016; Pasternak et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016).

107

Divergent mechanisms control gene expression during mitosis and meiosis

108

Repression of maternal mRNA translation is associated predominantly with mitochondrial

109

and ribosomal biogenesis, while translationally activated mRNAs code for proteins with functions

110

related to cell cycle and embryo development (Conti and Franciosi, 2018). Gene ontology (GO)

111

analysis of UP and DOWN transcripts at late MI reinforces this association (Fig. 2a). Genome-

112

wide comparison of our RNA-Seq data to those available for translation and transcription during

113

mitosis (Park et al., 2016) did not reveal any significant correlation (Fig. 2b), suggesting profound

114

differences in gene expression regulation during these processes. When the comparison between

115

mitosis and meiosis is restricted to genes specific to cell cycle function, only nine mRNAs overlap

116

in translation activation between mitosis and meiosis (Fig. 2c). However, a sizable group of

117

mRNAs whose translation is activated during meiosis instead is activated transcriptionally at the

118

S-to-M-phase transition. Although limited, overlap is also detected when translation repression

119

during meiosis is compared with changes in translation during mitosis. Manual curation of the

120

data confirms that decreased translation of Cdk1 and increased translation of Bub1b occur during

121

both mitosis and meiosis (Supplementary Fig. 3).

122

The pattern of mRNA translation in GV-arrested oocytes predicts changes occurring

123

during the G2-to-M-phase transition

124

During prophase I, maternal messages display a broad spectrum of translation efficiencies

125

(TEs) (Fig. 3a), calculated as the ratio between ribosome-bound and total mRNA levels; there is

126

a seven-fold difference when comparing the average TE of the 10% of mRNAs with the highest

127

TEs (high-TEs) to that of the 10% with the lowest TEs (low-TEs). To validate that TE reflects rate

128

of translation, we related these values to other available measurements (Morgan et al., 2017;

129

Wang et al., 2010) in GV-arrested oocytes. High-TE messages have significantly longer poly(A)

130

tails (≥ 70 nts) (Fig. 3b) and are associated with increased protein accumulation as assessed by

131

mass spectrometry (Fig. 3c).

132

GO analysis of low- and high-TE messages during prophase I arrest revealed associations

133

antithetical to those found during meiotic maturation (Fig. 2a). Functions important for oocyte

134

growth are significantly enriched for high-TE mRNAs, while functions important during oocyte

135

maturation are enriched in low-TE mRNAs (Fig. 3d). We hypothesize that, upon meiotic

136

resumption, a switch in the translation program occurs in order for the oocyte to progress through

137

meiosis and prepare for embryogenesis. Indeed, transcripts with greater TEs become

138

translationally downregulated (DOWN), while transcripts with lower TEs become activated (UP)

139

during meiotic maturation (Fig. 3e). More detailed analysis reveals that translation of 99% of low-

140

TE mRNAs is constitutive or upregulated during meiotic maturation, while translation of virtually

141

all of high-TE mRNAs is constitutive or repressed (Fig. 3f).

142

Unique mRNA features are associated with the opposing translation patterns in GV-

143

arrested oocytes

144

To understand how such a broad array of TEs is established in GV-arrested oocytes, we

145

correlated these values with various mRNA features genome-wide (Fig. 4a). ATG density, GC

146

content, and length of the 5’UTR are inversely correlated with TE. As for the 3’UTR,

147

polyadenylation signal (PAS) density and GC content are positively correlated, whereas DAZL-

148

binding element density, 3’ UTR length, and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) density

149

are all inversely correlated. Detailed analysis confirms this strong inverse relationship between

150

CPE density and TE, as 87% of low-TE mRNA contain putative CPEs in the 3’UTR, while this is

151

only true for 57% of high-TE mRNAs (Fig. 4b). The absence of CPEs proximal to the PAS is

152

significantly associated with greater TEs (Fig. 4c), and the closer a CPE is to the PAS, the less

153

efficiently a message is translated during prophase I arrest (Fig. 4d).

154

This correlation was confirmed by CPEB1 RNA-immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) followed by

155

RT-qPCR (Fig. 4e). While only two of the eight candidate high-TE mRNAs (Cdk8 and Dnmt1)

156

were immunoprecipitated above background levels, both of which have ≥ 1 CPEs in the 3’UTR,

157

all low-TE transcripts with CPEs in the 3’UTR were efficiently recovered in the CPEB1-IP pellet.

158

Binding of CPEB1 to CPE recruits a repressive complex in GV-arrested oocytes

159

To elucidate the mechanisms controlling translation during prophase I arrest, we focused

160

on members of the oocyte-secreted protein (OOSP) cluster (Oosp1, 2, and 3) (Paillisson et al.,

161

2005). Oosp1 (red) and Oosp3 (black) are translationally repressed during prophase I arrest and

162

activated after meiotic resumption, while Oosp2 is highly translated in GV-arrested oocytes and

163

its translation becomes repressed during meiotic maturation (Fig. 5a). While 60% of Oosp2

164

transcripts have poly(A) tails with ≥ 80 nts, Oosp1 (21%) and Oosp2 (6%) do not show this bias

165

(Fig. 5b). The 3’UTRs of Oosp1 and Oosp3 have two and four putative CPEs upstream of the

166

PAS, respectively, while Oosp2 has no obvious CPE.

167

Either YPet-Oosp1 or YPet-Oosp2 mRNAs (Fig. 5c and d) were injected into oocytes

168

along with polyadenylated mCherry mRNA and the translation of YPet was monitored via

169

quantitative live cell imaging (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The patterns of YPet accumulation for the

170

Oosp1 and Oosp2 reporters recapitulate the translation patterns of the mRNAs during meiotic

171

maturation as observed in the RNA-Seq data (Fig. 5c). During prophase I arrest, YPet-Oosp1-

172

oligo(A) was translated at a significantly lower rate than YPet-Oosp2-oligo(A) (Fig. 5e and 5f).

173

Notably, the translation rate of YPet-Oosp2-oligo(A) significantly increased during incubation,

174

whereas translation rate of the polyadenylated reporter (YPet-Oosp2-poly(A)) was initially high

175

and remained steady (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 4b and c). When polyadenylation of the

176

Oosp1 reporter was forced, the translation rate was initially high but decreased to levels

177

comparable to those of the oligoadenylated reporter (Fig. 5h and Supplementary Fig. 4b and d).

178

Therefore, regardless of its initial adenylation state, a reporter will eventually be translated at a

179

rate dictated by the 3’UTR (Supplementary Fig. 4e).

180

In YPet-Oosp1, single as well as combined mutations of CPE1 and CPE2 in the 3’UTR

181

(Fig. 5i) resulted in de-repressed translation to levels similar to those of YPet-Oosp2 (Fig. 5j and

182

k). These findings indicate a role of CPEs in the recruitment of an inhibitory complex. Using an

183

oocyte-specific, CPEB1 loss-of-function model (Supplementary Fig. 5), we investigated the

184

consequences of CPEB1 depletion on translation. While no significant difference in Ypet-Oosp1

185

translation were detected between CPEB1+/+ and CPEB1+/- oocytes, translation in CPEB1-/-

186

oocytes was significantly de-repressed (Fig. 5l and m). Of note, the effects of CPEB1 depletion

187

on Oosp1 de-repression were not as prominent as those achieved by mutating the CPEs in

188

Oosp1. These results provide strong evidence that CPEB1 binding to CPEs is necessary for

189

translation repression during prophase I arrest. However, regardless of the distance from the

190

PAS, addition of a CPE into the 3’UTR of Oosp2 was not sufficient to repress its translation rates

191

(Supplementary Fig. 6).

192

Translation repression during meiotic maturation is dependent on mRNA deadenylation

193

and is dissociated from destabilization

194

From prophase I to late MI, ribosome loading for 1722 transcripts is decreased (DOWN,

195

FDR ≤ 0.05). Translation repression is observed at as early as pro-metaphase I, but also occurs

196

later on during meiosis (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 7 and 8). For 92% of DOWN transcripts,

197

repression does not coincide with message destabilization, indicating that these two processes

198

are mechanistically decoupled. Several DOWN candidates with stable mRNA levels were chosen

199

for further investigation, including Oosp2 and mRNAs that code for components of the zona

200

pellucida (Zp1, Zp2, and Zp3) and the chromosome condensin complex (Smc4) (Fig. 6a). RT-

201

qPCR confirmed the stability of these mRNAs, with all levels being constant up to 8 hrs and most

202

up to 16 hrs of meiotic maturation (MII) (Fig. 6b). Poly(A) tail length (PAT) assays documents that

9

203

Smc4 and Zp2 were polyadenylated in prophase I (Supplementary Fig. 9a) and, by 2 hrs, their

204

poly(A) tails were significantly shortened (Fig. 6c).

205

A CPE in close proximity of the PAS is required to maintain translation during meiotic

206

maturation

207

The YPet-Zp2 reporter was translated at relatively high and steady rates during prophase

208

I and translation was repressed shortly after GVBD (Fig. 7a and b), in agreement with the RNA-

209

Seq data (Fig. 6a) and PAT assay (Fig. 6c). Similar results were obtained with YPet-Smc4

210

(Supplementary Fig. 9b and c) and Ypet-Oosp2 (see below). Oocytes released from cilostamide

211

block and simultaneously treated with the CDK1 inhibitor dinaciclib did not show differences in

212

YPet-Zp2 translation rates when compared to oocytes maintained in cilostamide, suggesting that

213

CDK1 activation and GVBD are required for translation repression. PKA inhibitor treatment (Rp-

214

cAMPS), used to block cAMP signaling, again resulted in no repression, indicating that cAMP is

215

not a signal involved in translation repression (Fig. 7c). However, treatment of oocytes with

216

dinaciclib after GVBD (2 hrs) resulted in decreased translation repression as compared to control

217

oocytes. Therefore, CDK1 activation and GVBD are events necessary to trigger translational

218

repression of Zp2 upon meiotic resumption.

219

To elucidate the mechanisms of constitutive or repressed translation during meiotic

220

maturation, we monitored the translation of the CcnB2 reporter, which is constitutively translated

221

before and after GVBD. Progressive deletions of the Ccnb2 short 3’UTR revealed that a reporter

222

retaining only the PAS sequence (YPet-CcnB2 short (102-118)) was translated like a prototypical

223

DOWN gene; it was highly translated during prophase I and translation became repressed after

224

GVBD (Fig. 7d). Presence of the first 42 nts of the 3’UTR did not significantly affect the translation

225

pattern (Supplementary Fig. 10a). If the 3’UTR included a CPE (YPet-Ccnb2 short (Δ49-102),

226

translation of the reporter was no longer repressed post-GVBD (Fig. 7d) and resembled the

227

pattern of a prototypical CONSTITUTIVE mRNA. Therefore, the presence a CPE is critical for an

10

228

mRNA to evade translation repression during meiotic maturation. This was confirmed by a gain-

229

of-function experiment using a repressed mRNA, where insertion of a CPE was sufficient to

230

maintain the high, prophase I translation rate of YFP-Zp2 after meiotic resumption (Fig. 7e).

231

We tested whether CPE position in relation to the PAS is important for the maintenance

232

of translation post-GVBD by using the Oosp2 3’UTR. When a CPE was added 22 nts upstream

233

of the PAS, reporter translation was no longer repressed upon meiotic resumption, but maintained

234

at the constant rate as in prophase I (Fig. 7f and Supplementary Fig. 10b). However, if the same

235

CPE was added 111 nts upstream of the PAS, translation was still repressed post-GVBD and the

236

pattern did not differ from that of YPet-Oosp2 (Fig. 7f and Supplementary Fig. 10b). Therefore,

237

during meiotic maturation, inclusion of a CPE proximal to the PAS in the 3’UTR of a translationally

238

repressed mRNA (gain-of function) changed its translation pattern to that of a constitutively

239

translated mRNA. Conversely, removal of a CPE proximal to the PAS from the 3’UTR of a

240

constitutively translated mRNA (loss-of-function) transformed its translation pattern to that of a

241

repressed mRNA.

242

Genome-wide analysis shows that 82% of CONSTITUTIVE mRNAs have at ≥ 1 CPEs in

243

the 3’UTR, while this is true for only 47% of DOWN mRNAs (Fig. 7g). Further analysis of these

244

classes reveals a bias towards the presence of CPEs within 50 nts upstream of the PAS in

245

constitutively translated mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 11).

246

Activation of translation during meiotic maturation is dependent on GVBD and, in part,

247

activation of CDK1

248

Concurrent with translation repression, progression through meiosis is associated with

249

significant increases in translation of 1537 maternal mRNAs (UP, FDR ≤ 0.05) (Supplementary

250

Fig. 1e). These UP mRNAs show both early and late increased translation (Supplementary Fig.

251

12). To investigate the mechanisms underlying this activation, we chose candidates with some of

252

the highest fold changes in ribosome loading from prophase I to late MI, Tcl1, Oosp1, Obox5,

11

253

Ccnb1, and Ewsr1 (Fig. 8a). RiboTag/RT-qPCR confirmed the translation pattern of these UP

254

transcripts (Fig. 8b). To investigate the link between cell cycle and the translation program during

255

meiosis, we used a YPet reporter fused with the Ccnb1 3’UTR, a transcript whose translation

256

activation after GVBD has been shown to be CDK1-dependent (Han et al., 2017). When CDK1

257

activity was inhibited immediately after release from PDE inhibition, GVBD did not occur and

258

translation was maintained at levels prior to cilostamide release (Fig. 8c). Oocytes treated with

259

dinaciclib after GVBD (2 hrs) eventually regained a nuclear membrane, indicating effective CDK1

260

inhibition, and translation of Ypet-Ccnb1 was reduced, but not abolished. This experiment was

261

also performed using YPet-Ewsr1, YPet-Oosp1, and YPet-Mos (Supplementary Fig. 13). While

262

dinaciclib treatment of GV-arrested oocytes completely inhibited translation of all the reporters,

263

CDK1 inhibition after GVBD only decreased the translation of YPet-Ccnb1 and Ypet-Ewsr1; the

264

translation of YPet-Oosp1 and YPet-Mos was unaffected (Fig. 8d). Therefore, early CDK1 activity

265

responsible for GVBD is required for translation activation of these candidates, while CDK1

266

activity in MI is only partially responsible for subsequent increases in translation of Ccnb1 and

267

Ewsr1. The variable effects of dinaciclib may be due to subtle differences in the timing and

268

mechanism’s of translation activation.

269

Regulation of mRNA translation by CDK1 is thought to be mediated by phosphorylation of

270

CPEB1 (Ballantyne et al., 1997; Han et al., 2017). Genome-wide analysis reveals that 95% of UP

271

transcripts have ≥ 1 CPEs in the 3’UTR (Fig. 8e). Using CPEB1-/- oocytes, we investigated the

272

role of CPEB1 in the regulation of Ccnb1 translation. CPEB1-/- oocytes showed significantly

273

decreased, but not abolished, translation rates as compared to wild type oocytes (Fig. 8f and g).

274

Moreover, depletion of CPEB resulted in higher translation rates prior to GVBD (Fig. 8g),

275

confirming the role of this RBP in translation repression during prophase I. Single mutations of

276

CPE1 and CPE2 in Oosp1 resulted in a significant increase in initial reporter translation, but there

277

were no effects on translation activation post-GVBD (Fig. 8h and i). This indicates that both CPEs

278

are necessary for translation repression during prophase I, but only one CPE is sufficient for

279

translation activation. Mutation of both CPEs did not further de-repress translation before GVBD,

280

but completely abolished translation activation post-GVBD (Fig. 8h and i), suggesting that

281

translation activation is not simply due to de-repression and that the two processes are

282

dissociated.

Discussion

285

Female gamete development is driven by transcription of not only maternal mRNAs

286

essential for the expansive growth taking place during this phase, but also of mRNAs needed for

287

the synthesis of proteins used later on during meiotic progression and embryo development. To

288

accomplish this developmental program, not all mRNAs are translated immediately after

289

synthesis. Some are, instead, stored for future use during later stages of development and their

290

translation is repressed until then. In this study, we used a genome-wide approach to demonstrate

291

that translation of housekeeping and instructive mRNAs in quiescent GV-arrested oocytes is due

292

only in part to low complexity 3’UTRs and therefore is not the default pathway. Robust translation

293

of 84% of high-TE mRNAs is associated with 3’ UTRs that are > 200 nts and include putative

294

binding elements for known RBPs. Conversely, translation repression in quiescent oocytes is

295

dependent on the assembly of complexes that promote deadenylation; our data suggest that this

296

complex is nucleated by CPEB1. CPEB1 is not sufficient, though, as repression is mitigated, not

297

abolished, in CPEB1-/- oocytes. Either compensatory mechanisms or alternative repressive

298

networks are functional in these GV-arrested oocytes. As the oocyte resumes meiosis, a switch

299

in the translation program occurs at around the time of germinal vesicle breakdown. Messenger

300

RNAs translated at high levels during growth become deadenylated and repressed in a manner

301

dependent on the properties of the 3’UTR, but total levels remain stable for the majority of these

302

mRNAs. Conversely, translation of mRNAs that were repressed in quiescent oocytes becomes

303

progressively activated through MI and MII.

304

The timing of translational repression is unique for each mRNA. In frog oocytes, it is

305

proposed that the deadenylase PARN is released at nuclear envelope breakdown, inducing the

306

default process of deadenylation (Barnard et al., 2004; Mendez et al., 2000a; Mendez et al.,

307

2000b). This mechanism may apply to only a minority of mRNAs in mouse oocytes, as 77% of

308

the maternal mRNA analyzed are translationally repressed well after GVBD, during MI or later. It

309

should be noted that, in some cases, translation repression coincides with inactivation of the

310

encoded protein. For example, CPEB1 protein degradation initiates at four to six hours post-

311

meiotic resumption (Han et al., 2017; Mendez et al., 2002). Our RNA-Seq data indicate that

312

ribosome association with Cpeb1 mRNAs begins to decrease around this time. Translation of

313

Cdk1 similarly decreases at the MI-to-anaphase transition, when M-Phase-promoting factor

314

(MPF) is inactivated because of CCNB1 degradation (Evans et al., 1983). Thus, changes in

315

message translation likely cooperates with protein turnover to regulate functions during meiosis.

316

Our genome-wide analysis of translation demonstrates that the environment of stable

317

maternal mRNAs present during oocyte growth extends well into the late stages meiosis. Here,

318

we have identified a first wave of mRNA destabilization at the MI-to-anaphase transition that

319

affects a subset of mRNAs; most messages that are translationally activated along with a subset

320

of translationally repressed mRNAs continue to remain stable well into MII. Eventually, these

321

maternal messages will be eliminated later on in the zygote and in the embryo at the time of

322

zygote genome activation in two successive waves of degradation (Yartseva and Giraldez, 2015).

323

Recently, mRNA methylation has emerged as a key regulator of mRNA stability and the m6A

324

reader YTHDF2 has been implicated in message destabilization in the oocyte (Ivanova et al.,

325

2017; Wang et al., 2014). However, we found minimal overlap between mRNAs destabilized in

326

MI and those stabilized by YTHDF2 loss-of-function. Thus, the code controlling timed

327

destabilization remains poorly understood. However, a CCR4/CNOT complex that includes

328

CNOT7/8 and BTG4 is responsible for destabilization of a subset of repressed mRNAs(Liu et al.,

329

2016; Pasternak et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016). Our RiboTag/RNA-Seq data do indicate that the

330

machinery required for mRNA destabilization/degradation is synthesized late during oocyte

331

maturation due to delayed translation of mRNAs such as Btg4, Cnot7, and Dcp1a.

332

CPEB1 is considered a master regulator of translation during oocyte meiosis. Our findings

333

are consistent with this concept, as 95% of mRNAs significantly activated from prophase I to late

15

334

MI have at least one CPE in the 3’UTR and all translationally activated candidates we tested

335

interact with CPEB1. Depletion of CPEB1 in the oocyte did not completely abolish translation

336

activation, pointing to the presence of other RBPs with similar function to CPEB1 or other

337

compensatory mechanisms. Moreover, we have characterized an additional function of this RBP

338

during oocyte maturation: CPEB1 is required for maintaining translation of thousands of maternal

339

mRNAs, preventing their deadenylation. Our genome-wide data provide evidence that a CPE in

340

close proximity of the PAS is required for this widespread translation of the majority of maternal

341

mRNAs. Studies in frog oocytes have revealed the presence of a combinatorial code of CPEs

342

enforcing repression and early and late activation(Pique et al., 2008). Our global analysis

343

documents that CPE elements cluster in the vicinity of the PAS (< 100 nts), and that both

344

repression and activation are associated with the presence of more than one CPE element in the

345

3’UTR. Using Oosp1 mRNA as prototypic mRNA repressed in prophase and activated in MI, we

346

demonstrated that two CPEs are required for repression, but one CPE is sufficient for activation.

347

Although some of the features of the combinatorial code described in Xenopus were confirmed,

348

more complex rules govern the functions of CPEs in oocyte translation.

349

We demonstrate that the pattern of translation switches at the time CDK1 is activated in

350

the oocyte. If CDK1 activity is inhibited, no activation or repression of translation takes place and

351

GVBD, however, is also blocked. Under our experimental conditions and if CDK1 inhibition is

352

delayed after GVBD, translation of some mRNAs including CcnB1 and Ewsr1 was partially

353

inhibited whereas that of Mos and Oosp1 was not significantly affected. A possible explanation of

354

this differential sensitivity to CDK1 is the presence of distinct mechanisms of translational

355

activation downstream of CDK1. Differences in translation mechanisms for Mos and Ccnb1 have

356

been demonstrated in frog oocytes(Mendez et al., 2002; Sheets et al., 1994). However, given the

357

very rapid re-entry in meiosis of mouse oocytes, we are unable to dissect possible CDK1-

358

independent mechanisms of translation activation.

359

In summary, our genome-wide approach provides a novel perspective on the dynamics of

360

the translational program in mouse oocytes. Since the combinatorial code described in frog

361

oocytes(Pique et al., 2008) is applicable only to a subset of mammalian mRNAs, more complex

362

mechanisms are functioning in mammalian oocytes. Additionally, to be defined is whether a

363

CPEB-mediated translation program is required during oocyte growth as short, low complexity

364

3’UTRs are associated with only a portion of the mRNA translated during growth. Finally,

365

differences in how the translation program is executed between mouse and human must exist

366

and should to be explored to gain a better understanding of the human oocyte-to-zygote transition

367

and female fertility.

Fig. 1. The translational program during oocyte meiotic cell cycle involves both
translational repression and activation
a) Spindle and chromatin conformation in the oocyte during meiosis. Oocytes were matured in
vitro and fixed at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hrs post-meiotic resumption. Immunofluorescence staining for
tubulin (green), kinetochores (red), and chromatin (blue) was performed. Maturing oocytes either
presented chromosome condensation, but no spindle assembly (2 hrs, pro-metaphase I), visible
initial spindle formation (4 hrs, early MI), progressive spindle formation with kinetochore
attachment (6 hrs, MI), or a fully attached, MI-bipolar spindle (8 hrs, late MI). b) Total mRNA levels
and differential ribosome loading during meiotic progression as compared to prophase I arrest.
Oocytes were matured in vitro and collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hrs post-meiotic resumption. Total
RNA samples were collected prior to RiboTag-IP for each time point. cDNA libraries were
prepared from total and ribosome-bound RNA samples, RNA-Seq was performed, and the data
processed and analyzed as described in the “Methods”. The data are presented as volcano plots
with log2(fold change) (LFC) CPM at each time point compared to 0 hrs and plotted against false
discovery rate (FDR). Statistically significant increased (red) and decreased (blue) (FDR ≤ 0.05)
genes are reported as well as non-significant changes (grey). LFCs ≤ -1 or ≥ 1 are considered
biologically significant and are marked by dashed lines. Two biological replicates of 200 oocytes
per time point were used for this experiment. c) Changes in the transcriptome and translatome
during meiosis. The late MI data are derived from the experiment described in Fig. 1b, MII
translation data are from a deposited dataset generated from oocytes matured in vivo followed by
polysome fractionation/microarray (polysome array)(Chen et al., 2011; Conti and Franciosi,
2018); and prophase-to-MII total mRNA data were from a deposited dataset(Su et al., 2007). The
data are reported as scatterplots with LFC in total mRNA CPM at either late MI or MII compared
to prophase I arrest versus the LFC of ribosome-bound mRNA CPM at the same time points. We

identified four groups of messages: transcripts that showed significant changes only in translation
(purple), significant changes only in total message levels (orange), no significant changes in
translation nor in total transcript levels (grey), and significant changes in both translation and total
transcript levels (black); significant changes are defined as FDR ≤ 0.05. Two biological replicates
of 200 oocytes per time point were used to generate the RNA-Seq data, while six biological
replicates of 500 oocytes per time point were used to generate the polysome array data. d)
Overlap of translatome changes between late MI and MII. Both DOWN (blue) and UP (red) genes

Fig. 3. Genome-wide analysis of translation reveals a switch in the translation program at
the quiescence-to-meiotic cell cycle re-entry transition
a) Histogram of translational efficiencies in GV-arrested oocytes. Translation efficiency (TE) for
individual mRNAs was calculated as the ratio between ribosome-associated and total mRNA
CPMs. Plotted is the distribution of TE values of maternal mRNAs during prophase I arrest. The
10% of mRNAs with the lowest TEs are designated as low-TE mRNAs (n = 734, grey box) and
the 10% of mRNAs with the highest TEs as high-TE mRNAs (n = 734, yellow box); this definition
is used for all the subsequent comparisons. b) Genome-wide relationship between TE and poly(A)
tail length in GV-arrested oocytes. TE was calculated for individual mRNAs as described in Fig.
3a. Deposited TAIL-Seq data on poly(A) tail length of maternal mRNAs during prophase I
arrest(Morgan et al., 2017) were associated with their TEs during this time. Median values are
represented by red lines and the 25 and 75% quartiles are represented by black, dashed lines.
Statistical significance was evaluated by unpaired, two-tailed t-tests. ****: p < 0.0001. c) Genomewide relationship between TE and protein levels in GV-arrested oocytes. TE was calculated for
individual mRNAs as described in Fig. 3a. Deposited data on protein levels in GV-arrested
oocytes as quantified by mass spectrometry(Wang et al., 2010) were associated with the TEs of
maternal mRNAs. Median values are represented by red lines and the 25 and 75% quartiles are
represented by black, dashed lines. Statistical significance was evaluated by unpaired, two-tailed
t-test; ****: p < 0.0001. d) Gene ontology analysis of low- and high-TE maternal mRNAs in GVarrested oocytes. Only terms with a Benjamini coefficient ≤ 0.05 were considered. e) Genomewide relationship between TE in prophase I arrest and translation pattern during meiotic
resumption of oocyte maternal mRNAs. TE was calculated for individual mRNAs as described in
Fig. 3a. The data are presented as a scatterplot of total mRNA CPMs compared to TE values in
GV-arrested oocytes. Transcripts are then categorized as CONSTITUTIVE (grey), DOWN (blue),
or UP (red) on the basis of their translation pattern during maturation to late MI (-1 ≥ LFC ≥ 1 and

Fig. 4. Features associated with maternal mRNAs translated with high or low efficiency in
GV-arrested oocytes
a) Genome-wide correlation between mRNA features with TE in GV-arrested oocytes. PAS
density in the 3’UTR, GC content in the 3’ and 5’UTRs, ATG density in the 5’UTR, DAZL and
CPEB cis-acting element densities in the 3’UTR, and 3’UTR and 5’UTR lengths were calculated
as detailed in the “Methods”. These data were then correlated with TEs during prophase I arrest
and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for every comparison; p < 0.0001 for all
pairs. In mRNAs with higher TEs, the reduced number of 3’UTR cis-acting elements is not due to
shorter 3’UTR length, as element number was normalized for 3’UTR length when calculating
densities. b) Detailed analysis of the relationship between TE in prophase I arrest and presence
of CPEs in the 3’UTR of low- and high-TE mRNAs. Pie charts report the percentage of low- or
high-TE mRNAs in GV-arrested oocytes where a CPE could be identified. Scanning for CPE in
the 3’ UTRs was performed as detailed in the “Methods”. c) Genome-wide relationship between
TE and number of CPEs found within 100 nts of the PAS in GV-arrested oocytes. Median values
are represented by red lines and the 25 and 75% quartiles are represented by black, dashed
lines. Statistical significance was evaluated by unpaired, two-tailed t-tests; *: p = 0.0313; **** p <
0.0001. d) Detailed analysis of the relationship between TE in prophase I arrest and the distance
of the closest CPE to the PAS. Median values are represented by red lines and the 25 and 75%
quartiles are represented by black, dashed lines. e) Enrichment of low-TE mRNAs bound to
CPEB1 in GV-arrested oocytes. GV-arrested oocytes were collected and RNA-IP followed by RTqPCR was performed as described in the “Methods”. Nlrp5 was used as a reference gene as it is
known to not bind to CPEB1. Three biological replicates of 200 oocytes per time point were used
and RT-qPCR reactions were run in triplicate. Data are presented as fold difference in mRNA
levels in CPEB1-IP as compared to the IgG-IP. The bars represent the mean ± SEM of three

GV-arrested oocytes
a) TE values of members of the Oosp cluster during meiosis. The dubplicate average and range
of TEs are reported. b) Polyadenylation state of members of the Oosp cluster in GV-arrested
oocytes. Data were from a published TAIL-Seq study(Morgan et al., 2017). c) Accumulation of
YPet reporters for Oosp1 and Oosp2 3’UTRs during meiotic maturation. GV-arrested oocytes
were collected and microinjected with oligoadenylated YPet-Oosp1 (red) or YPet-Oosp2 (blue)
mRNA along with polyadenylated mCherry mRNA. Oocytes were allowed to recover for 16 hrs
after microinjection, released from cilostamide block, and imaged for 16 hrs with a sampling
frequency of 15 mins. Each point is the mean ± SEM of individual oocyte traces obtained in three
separate experiments. The total number of oocytes analyzed is in parentheses. d) YPet reporters
for Oosp1 and Oosp2 3’UTRs. 3’ UTRs expressed in the oocytes were cloned downstream of the
YPet ORF (yellow box). CPEs (grey ovals) and PASes (green hexagons) are shown along with
relevant nucleotide positions relative to the start of the 3’UTR. e) Accumulation of Oosp1 and
Oosp2 3’UTR YPet reporters in GV-arrested oocytes. GV-arrested oocytes were collected and
microinjected with oligoadenylated YPet-Oosp1 (red) or YPet-Oosp2 (blue) mRNA along with
polyadenylated mCherry mRNA. Oocytes were allowed to recover for 2.5 hrs after microinjection,
maintained in prophase I, and imaged for 9 hrs with a sampling frequency of 15 mins. Each point

Fig. 6. Translational repression during oocyte reentry into the cell cycle is dissociated from
destabilization and requires de-adenylation
a) Time course of ribosome loading onto repressed candidate mRNAs (DOWN) during meiotic
maturation. Values are from our RiboTag/RNA-Seq dataset and the mean and range of duplicate
biological replicates are plotted. b) Translational repression of endogenous mRNAs is dissociated
from destabilization. Oocytes were matured in vitro up to MII and samples were collected at
different times during maturation. RNA was extracted from the oocytes, reverse transcribed, and
used for RT-qPCR. Bcl2l10 was used as a reference gene as its levels are known to be stable
during this time. Data are represented as fold changes in mRNA levels as compared to 0 hrs.
Three biological replicates of 30 oocytes per time point were used and RT-qPCR reactions were
run in triplicate. The bars represent the mean ± SEM of three experiments. Statistical significance
was evaluated by Friedman tests; *: p < 0.05. c) Translational repression of endogenous Smc4
and Zp2 is associated with message de-adenylation. Oocytes were either maintained in prophase
I arrest (0 hrs) or allowed to mature for 2 or 8 hrs. At the end of the incubation, RNA was extracted
and used for PAT assays with anchored oligo-dT primers. A representative experiment of the
three performed is reported.

Fig. 7 Translational repression during meiotic maturation is recapitulated by the 3’UTR of
DOWN mRNAs, requires CDK1 activation, and is prevented by the presence of a CPE in
close proximity to the PAS
a) The 3’ UTR of Zp2 (high-TE in prophase I and DOWN transcript) recapitulates the rapid
translation repression post-GVBD. Oocytes were injected with an oligoadenylated YPet-Zp2
mRNA together with a polyadenylated mCherry mRNA. Oocytes were then either maintained in
prophase I arrest with cilostamide treatment (empty circles) or allowed to mature (solid circles)
and imaged for 10 hrs with a sampling frequency of 30 mins. Data are reported as the fold change
of the YPet/mCherry ratios as compared to 0 hrs. Each point is the mean ± SEM of individual
oocyte traces obtained in two separate experiments. The total number of oocytes analyzed is in
parentheses. b) Translation rates of the YPet-Zp2 reporter in GV-arrested or maturing oocytes.
The translation rate for each oocyte was calculated by linear regression of the reporter data (Fig.
7a) between 3 and 6 hrs. Mean ± SEM are reported. Statistical significance was evaluated by
unpaired, two-tailed t-test; ****: p < 0.0001. c) Translation repression of the YPet-Zp2 reporter
during meiosis resumption requires GVBD and CDK1 activation but not PKA activity. After
microinjection of the YPet-Zp2 reporter, oocytes were released in cilostamide-free medium and
incubated with a CDK1 inhibitor (5 μM dinaciclib) or a combination of CDK1 and PKA inhibitors
(Rp-cAMPS) from the time of release (0 hrs). The translation rate for each oocyte was calculated
by linear regression of the reporter data between 3 and 6 hrs. In another group, dinaciclib was
added after GVBD at 2 hrs into incubation. Statistical significance was evaluated by unpaired,
two-tailed t-tests; ns: not significant; **: p = 0.0053. d) Deletion mutagenesis of the Ccnb2 3’UTR.
GV-arrested oocytes were collected, microinjected with oligoadenylated YPet-CcnB2 short or
reporters fused to the Ccnb2 3’UTRs with progressive deletions along with a polyadenylated
mCherry reporter. Sixteen hrs after microinjection, oocytes were either maintained in prophase I
arrest with cilostamide (empty circles) or allowed to mature (solid circles) and imaged for 6 hrs

of a CPE in the 3’ UTR of Zp2 (DOWN), prevents repression during meiotic maturation. GVarrested oocytes were collected, microinjected with oligoadenylated YPet-Zp2 +CPE mRNA
together with a polyadenylated mCherry mRNA. Experimental conditions were as described in
Fig. 7a. Data are reported as the fold change of the YPet/mCherry ratios as compared to 0 hrs.
Each point is the mean ± SEM of individual oocyte traces obtained in two separate experiments.

of the PAS in the Oosp2 3’UTR prevents translational repression during meiotic maturation. GVarrested oocytes were collected, microinjected with oligoadenylated YPet-Oosp2 or a reporter
with a CPE inserted in the Oosp2 3’UTR along with a polyadenylated mCherry reporter. Oocytes
were incubated for 16 hrs after microinjection, allowed to mature, and imaged for 16 hrs with a
sampling frequency of 15 mins. Data are reported as the fold change of the YPet/mCherry ratios
as compared to 0 hrs. Each point is the mean ± SEM of individual oocyte traces obtained in three
separate experiments. The total number of oocytes analyzed is in parentheses. g) Detailed
analysis of the relationship between translation patterns during meiotic resumption and the
presence of CPEs in the 3’UTR. Pie charts report the percentage of CONSTUTIVE or DOWN

Fig. 8 CPEB binding to mRNAs activated during maturation is necessary, but not sufficient,
for full translational activation
a) Pattern of ribosome loading onto UP mRNAs during meiotic maturation. mRNAs whose
translation increased by at least three-fold from prophase I to late MI in our RiboTag/RNA-Seq
dataset are shown. Traces of the 149 mRNAs with the highest activation are in grey and
transcripts recovered in the pellet of RNA-IP/RT-qPCR with CPEB1 are in black. * denotes
transcripts that are also immunoprecipitated by DAZL antibodies (data under review). b) RiboTagIP/RT-qPCR validation of ribosome loading for selected UP candidates. Zp3-CreT RiboTagF/F mice
were hormone primed and the oocytes isolated. Oocytes were either maintained in prophase I or
matured in vitro for 8 hrs and collected for downstream RiboTag-IP/RT-qPCR analysis. We
quantified several candidates with some of the greatest fold changes in ribosome loading from
prophase to late MI. Dppa3 was used as a reference gene as it is known to be constitutively
translated during this time. Data are represented as fold changes in message levels as compared
to 0 hrs. Three biological replicates of 200 oocytes per time point were used and RT-qPCR
reactions were run in triplicate. The bars represent the mean ± SEM of three experiments.
Statistical significance was evaluated by unpaired, two-tailed t-tests; ****: p < 0.0001. c) The effect
of CDK1 inhibition on the translation of CcnB1 (UP). GV-arrested oocytes were collected and
microinjected with oligoadenylated YPet-CcnB1 3’UTR mRNA along with polyadenylated
mCherry mRNA. Oocytes were incubated for 16 hrs then two groups of oocytes were maintained
in prophase I arrest with either cilostamide (empty, black circle) or dinaciclib without cilostamide
(blue circle). Another two groups of oocytes were either matured without (solid, black circle) or
with dinaciclib added at 2 hrs after release (red circle). Imaging started 2 hrs after cilostamide
release and lasted for 10 hrs with a sampling frequency of 15 mins. Each point is the mean ±
SEM of individual oocyte traces obtained in three separate experiments. The total number of
oocytes analyzed is in parentheses. d) Translation rates of YPet-CcnB1 and YPet-Ewsr1 are

Methods
Animals
All experimental procedures involving mice were approved by the University of California,
San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval #AN101432). Animal care
and use were performed according to relevant guidelines and regulations. All animals used were
of the C57BL/6J inbred strain. C57BL/6-Zp3cre-Rpl22tm1.1Psam (Zp3-CreT RiboTag) mice were
obtained from Jackson Laboratories and bred as previously described(Martins et al., 2016).
CPEB1-targeted mice were a gift from Raúl Méndez and colleagues(Calderone et al., 2016) and
bred in our laboratory.
Oocyte isolation and culture
Three-week old female mice were injected with 5 I.U. PMSG to induce superovulation.
Forty-four hrs after injection, the mice were euthanized and the ovaries dissected into media
containing HEPES and 1 µM cilostamide (Millipore, 231085) (HC media). The antral follicles were
punctured, allowing release of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). Repeated aspiration through
a glass pipette allowed for removal of the surrounding cumulus cells. Denuded oocytes were
maintained at prophase I arrest in MEM Alpha (Gibco, 12561-056) supplemented with sodium
pyruvate (Gibco, 11360070) and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122) in addition to 1 µM
cilostamide (αC media) at 37°C under 5% CO2. If indicated, oocytes were transferred to
cilostamide-free MEM Alpha (α media), allowed to mature, and collected at various time points.
Where specified, oocytes were treated with 5 µM dinaciclib (Selleckchem, SCH727965) or 10 mM
Rp-cAMPS.

Oocytes were collected at various time points and fixed in DPBS (GE Healthcare,
SH30264.02) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma, X-100) and 2% formaldehyde
(ThermoFisher, 28908) for 30 mins. After washing in blocking buffer (1x DPBS, 0.3% BSA, and
0.01% Tween), the oocytes were incubated in blocking buffer for 16 hrs and permeabilized for 15
mins in DPBS supplemented with 0.3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were washed and
then incubated for 1 hr with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. The antibodies used were:
1:100 β-tubulin (9F3) rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling Technology, 3623); 1:200 human antibody
against centromere (ImmunoVision, HCT-0100). After another round of washing, samples were
incubated for 1 hr with the corresponding secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor
488 (ThermoFisher, A-11008) or 1:500 goat anti-human IgG, Alexa Fluor 568 (ThermoFisher, A21090). Oocytes were washed again and then mounted with VECTASHIELD® Antifade Mounting
Medium with DAPI (Vector, H-1200). All washes were done three times each round in blocking
buffer for 10 mins each wash. Images were captured with a confocal Nikon C1SI equipped with
X60 oil immersion lens and processed with ImageJ(Rueden et al., 2017).
RiboTag-immunoprecipitation (RiboTag-IP)
Only Zp3-CreT RiboTagF/F female mice used for RiboTag-immunoprecipitation. Oocytes
were collected in 5 µl 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; Sigma, P0930) in 1x PBS (Invitrogen,
AM9625), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C.
The appropriate volume (50 µl per sample) of Dynabeads™ Protein G (Invitrogen,
10004D) was washed three times in 500 µl homogenization buffer (HB: 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4,
100 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, and 1% NP-40) on a rotor at 4°C for 5 mins per wash. Two additional
washes were performed with 500 µl sHB on a rotor at 4°C for 10 mins per wash. The final wash
solution was removed and the beads were eluted in the original volume of HB supplemented
(sHB) with 1mM DTT, 1x protease inhibitors, 200 units/ml RNaseOUT, 100 µg/ml cycloheximide,

and 1mg/ml heparin. Samples were thawed, randomly pooled to yield a total of 200 oocytes per
time point per replicate, and 300 µl of sHB was added to each pooled sample. To lyse the cells,
samples were vortexed for 30 secs, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed at room
temperature (RT); this process was repeated twice. Finally, the homogenates were centrifuged
for 10 mins at maximum speed and 4°C and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. To
pre-clear the samples, 20 µl washed beads was added to each supernatants and samples were
incubated on a rotor at 4°C for 1 hr. A magnetic rack was used to remove the beads and 15 µl of
each pre-cleared lysate was collected and added to 200 µl RLT buffer per sample (Qiagen, 74034)
to serve as the input samples. The input samples were frozen and kept at -80°C until RNA
extraction. Three µl (3 µg) anti-HA.11 epitope tag antibody (BioLegend, 901501) was added to
each of the extracts and all samples were incubated on a rotor at 4°C for 4 hrs. Thirty µl washed
beads was then added to the samples and incubated overnight on a rotor at 4°C. The beads (now
bound by HA-tagged ribosomes and the associated mRNAs) were washed 5 times in 1 ml of urea
wash buffer (uWB: 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, 1x protease
inhibitors, 1 mM DTT, 40 U RNaseOUT, 1 mg/ml heparin, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 1 M urea)
on a rotor at 4°C for 10 mins per wash. The beads were then pelleted via a magnetic rack and
the uWB removed. Two-hundred and fifty µl RLT buffer was added to each sample and the
samples were vortexed for 30 seconds. RNA extraction was performed following the Rneasy Plus
Micro Kit protocol (Qiagen, 74034). Samples were eluted in 10 µl of RNase-free water and used
downstream for RNA-Seq or RT-qPCR analysis.

RNA samples were sent to the Gladstone Institutes Genomics Core for quality control
using Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and cDNA library preparation. Samples were sequenced using the
HiSeq 4000 system (Illumina).
Sequence quality assessment and trimming
The quality of the raw sequence data was checked via FASTQC. The sequence files were
then trimmed using tools in Trimmomatic-0.36(Bolger et al., 2014). The following were removed:
Illumina TruSeq3 single-ended adapter sequences, bases with a quality score lower than 3 at the
start and end of a read, bases that had an average quality per base of below 15 calculated using
a sliding window to average four bases, and any reads that were shorter than 36 bases. Input
reads were single-ended and input qualities were ASCII characters equal to the Phred quality
plus 33.
Mapping and counting reads
HiSat2(Kim et al., 2015) was used to build indexes from the Reference Consortium Mouse
Build 38 (mm10) and to align sequence reads to the genome. The resulting .bam files were sorted
and indexed with SAMtools(Li et al., 2009). Count files for each group were created with HTSeq
using the Mouse GENCODE Gene set release M11. The input data were .bam files, the data were
not from a strand-specific assay, and the feature type used was ‘gene.’
Differential expression (DE) analysis
The Bioconductor packages edgeR(Robinson et al., 2010) and limma(Ritchie et al., 2015)
were used for statistical analyses. Only reads with greater or equal to 10 counts per million (CPM)
in at least 2 samples were kept. Trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalization, which accounts
for compositional differences among the libraries, was then performed on HA reads and input
reads, separately. Using the raw counts, dispersion, and design matrix, the negative binomial

generalized linear model was fitted for each gene. Finally, pairwise likelihood ratio tests for 2, 4,
6, and 8 hrs versus 0 hrs were conducted.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis
Gene lists were uploaded to DAVID 6.8(Huang et al., 2009a, b) and processed with the Functional
Annotation Tool.
Analysis of 3’UTR sequences
The 3’UTR sequences of the genes of interest (including known mRNA isoforms) were
downloaded using the Table Browser (UCSC Genes track) provided by GBShape(Chiu et al.,
2015). The locations of putative PAS (AATAAA, ATTAAA, and AAGAAA)(Beaudoing et al., 2000)
and CPE (TTTTAT, TTTTAAT, TTTTACT, TTTTAAAT, TTTTAAGT, and TTTTCAT)(Pique et al.,
2008) sequences were determined via the Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO) tool(Grant
et al., 2011), which is part of the MEME Suite(Bailey et al., 2009); only exact matches were used
for downstream analysis. Python scripts were written to calculate the distance of each CPE from
each PAS for individual 3’UTRs.
Data visualization
ggplot2(Wickham, 2009) was used to create the multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plots,
which are used to visualize sample-to-sample distances, and translation activation and repression

RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP)
The appropriate volume (50 µl per sample) of Dynabeads™ Protein G (Invitrogen,
10004D) was washed twice in 250 ul incomplete lysis buffer (iLB: 15 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 75 mM

at 4°C for 5 mins. Two additional washes were performed with 250 µl complete LB (cLB: iLB
supplemented with protease inhibitor, DTT, RNAseOUT, ribonucleoside vanadyl complex, and
cycloheximide) on a rotor at 4°C for 5 mins per wash. The final wash solution was removed and
the beads were eluted in the original volume of cLB. Oocytes were isolated as described and kept
arrested at prophase I. Two hundred oocytes were collected in 5 µl 0.1% PVP in PBS, flash frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. To homogenize the cells, 250 µl of cLB was added to the
samples, samples were vortexed for 30 secs, and then incubated on ice for 10 mins. The
homogenates were then centrifuged for 10 mins at maximum speed at 4°C and the supernatants
were transferred to new tubes. Fifiteen µl of each supernatant was saved as input samples and
the rest were equally aliquoted for the CPEB1-IP and the IgG-IP (control). The volume of each
sample was increased to 300 µl with cLB, 2 µl (2 µg) of the appropriate antibody (anti-CPEB:
Abcam, ab73287 and control IgG: Abcam, ab172730) was added to each tube, and samples were
incubated on a rotor for 2 hrs at 4°C. Thirty µl washed beads were then added to each tube and
samples were incubated on a rotor overnight at 4°C. The beads of each sample were pelleted
using a magnetic rack and washed 5 times on a rotor at 4°C with 750 ml wash buffer (WB: 30 mM
Tris HCl pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25 mM Na3VO4, 10mM βglycerophosphate, 1x protease inhibitor, 1 mM DTT, 1M urea, and 1x RNase out) for 10 mins
each wash. The beads were then pelleted via a magnetic rack and the WB removed. Two-hundred
and fifty µl RLT buffer was added to each sample and the samples were vortexed for 30 secs.
RNA extraction was performed following the Rneasy Plus Micro Kit protocol. Samples were eluted
in 10 µl of RNase-free water and used for downstream RT-qPCR analysis.
Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
Extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis
System with random hexamer primers (Invitrogen, 18080051) and the resulting cDNA was diluted
1:6 with RNase-free water. Gene expression was measured using TaqMan AssaysTM and

(Mm00494367_m1), Zp2 (Mm00442173_m1), and Zp3 (Mm00442176_m1). Ten µl reactions
were run on 384-well plates with the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-time PCR System. Gene expression
was quantified via the 2-ΔΔCt method and statistical analysis was performed via GraphPad Prism
8.
Construction of florescent protein reporters
The 3’ UTR sequences of Ccnb1, Ccnb2 short, Ewsr1, Mos, Oosp1, Oosp2, Smc4, and
Zp2 were retrieved from the RNA-Seq .bam files using the Integrative Genomics Viewer
(Supplementary Table 1). Primers were used to amplify the target 3’ UTRs from oocyte cDNA and
portions of YFP-containing vector. Using the Choo-Choo CloningTM Kit (MCLAB, CCK-20), the
PCR fragments were fused together and transfected into competent 5-α E. coli cells. The DNA
plasmids of ampicillin-resistant bacteria were extracted using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit
(Qiagen, 27106) and the sequences confirmed via DNA sequencing. The extracted plasmid was
then linearized using a forward primer upstream of the YFP sequence and a reverse primer to the
3’UTR with 20 additional thymine residues. The PCR product was then transcribed in vitro using
the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen, AM1344) and the resulting cRNA
was purified using the MEGAclear™ Transcription Clean-Up Kit (Invitrogen, AM1908); cRNA were
eluted in RNase-free water and kept at -80°C. The mCherry reporter was similarly produced.

However, the message contained no 3’UTR, but instead was polyadenylated (150-200 nts) using
the Poly(A) Tailing Kit (Invitrogen, AM1350).
Oocyte microinjection
Oocytes were collected as described and allowed to recover in αC media for two hrs, after
which they were transferred into HC media for microinjection. Oocytes were injected with 5-10 pl
of a 12.5 ng/µl solution of the YFP reporter of interest mixed with mCherry mRNA and allowed to
recover in αC media for the specified amount of time before live cell imaging.
Live cell imaging and fluorescence microscopy
Live cell imaging experiments were performed using a Nikon Eclipse T2000-E equipped
with mobile stage and environmental chamber at 37°C and 5% CO2. Filter set: dichroic mirror
YFP/CFP/mCherry 69008BS; Ypet channel (Ex: S500/20x 49057; Em: D535/30m 47281),
mCherry channel (Ex: 580/25x 49829; Em: 632/60m). Images were processed and fluorescence
was quantified using MetaMorph.
Poly(A) tail length (PAT) assay
This assay was performed as previously described(Yang et al., 2017).
Histology
Ovaries were dissected from eight week-old female mice, fixed in Bouin’s solution, and
preserved in 70% ethanol. Tissues were then processed, cut at 8 µm, and stained (H&E) by the
Cancer Center Tissue Core at UCSF.
Western blot
Oocytes were collected in 0.1% PVP in DPBS and boiled for 3 mins at 95°C in 1x Laemmli

and phosphatase inhibitor. Samples were resolved on a 10% Laemmli gel and semi-dry
transferred onto supported nitrocellulose membranes, 0.2 µm (Bio-Rad, 1620097). Membranes
were incubated in 5% blocking buffer for 1 hr then incubated for 18 hrs in primary antibody at 4°C.
The antibodies used: 1:1000 rabbit anti-CPEB1 (Abcam, ab73287). The membrane was then
washed in 1x TBST, incubated in the appropriate secondary antibodies, 1:20,000 rabbit IgG (GE
Healthcare, NA934V) for 2 hrs, and washed again in 1x TBST. Clarity Western ECL substrate
(Bio-Rad, 1705061) was then used to develop the membrane. All washes were done four times
each round in TBST for 10 mins each wash.
