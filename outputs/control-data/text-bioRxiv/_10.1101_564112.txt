Abstract
Human autofluorescence (AF) has shown significant potential for non-invasive
diagnosis, while information regarding the pathological implications of the changes of
epidermal AF is deficient.

Our study has suggested that epidermal green AF may become the

first endogenous indicator of the levels of inflammatory and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
factors to which the skin is exposed: The AF intensity has virtually linear relationships with the
dosages of UV, LPS and ROS in mouse models or skin cell culture studies; and the green AF
intensity in skin is also highly correlated with the risk of cerebral small vessel disease patients
to develop acute ischemic stroke.

Since ROS and inflammatory factors to which healthy skin

is exposed should come from such pathways as the blood circulation, epidermal green AF may
also become the first biomarker of the levels of oxidative stress and inflammation in the body.
We further found that keratin 1 degradation mediates the UV-induced increases in green AF
intensity, and that decreased keratin 1 levels can lead to cell death.

These findings have

collectively suggested that organ damage-produced ROS and inflammatory factors may be
transported along the body, producing increased epidermal green AF, which may become a
common biomarker for organ injury as well as the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in
the body. Our study has also highlighted an essential relationship between skin’s changes and
organ damage, as well as critical roles of epidermal keratins in both UV-induced skin damage
and non-invasive evaluation of organ injury.

Introduction
Human autofluorescence (AF) has shown significant promise for non-invasive diagnosis
of certain diseases including diabetes

1

and cancer 2.

Melanin, keratins, NADH and FAD are

four major known epidermal fluorophores3,4. However, there is distinct deficiency in the
information regarding the effects of various pathological insults on epidermal AF.

Since

oxidative stress and inflammation are common key pathological factors in the organ injury of a
number of diseases such as acute ischemic stroke (AIS)

5,6

and myocardial infarction (MI)

7,8

,

elucidation of the effects of oxidative stress and inflammation on epidermal AF may establish
basis for non-invasive evaluation of organ injury.

epidermolytic ichthyosis, palmar-plantar keratoderma, and ichthyosis with confetti 17,18,19. It is
of both theoretical and clinical significance to further elucidate the biochemical and biophysical
properties of keratins.

While keratins is one of the four major epidermal fluorophores 4, three

major questions regarding epidermal keratins’ AF have remained unanswered: 1) In addition to
its basal AF, can the keratins’ AF be induced by pathological insults ?

2) Which keratins are

responsible for the epidermal green AF under physiological and pathological conditions? 3)
Does epidermal keratins’ AF have any biomedical significance ?

inflammation in not only the organ, but also other parts of the body such as the blood
circulation

5-8,20-27

.

Considering that major epidermal fluorophores include the key

mitochondrial electron donor NADH and a key mitochondrial electron acceptor FAD 4, it is
reasonable to expect that the ROS and inflammatory factors in the blood circulation or
interstitial fluid may alter epidermal AF by affecting the levels and state of these epidermal
fluorophores.
Our current study determined the effects of three major types of pathological insults,
including UV, oxidative stress and inflammation, on the epidermal AF in both mouse models
and skin cell culture models.

We also determined skin’s green AF of UV-exposed human

subjects, cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) patients and AIS patients. Our study has
suggested that the keratin-based epidermal green AF may become a novel biomarker for the
levels of these pathological insults to the skin.

These findings have also suggested that organ

damage-produced inflammatory factors and ROS can produce increased epidermal green AF,
which may become a common biomarker for organ injury.

Studies on human Subjects
The study on UVC-exposures of human body was conducted according to a protocol s
approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Subject Studies of Shanghai Ninth Hospital,
Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.

The study on CSVD patients and AIS

patients was conducted according to a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai
Fifth People’s Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University. The human subjects in our study were
divided into four groups: Group 1: The group of healthy persons; Group 2: The group of
CSVD patients with low-risk of developing AIS; Group 3: The group of CSVD patients with
high-risk of developing AIS; and Group 4: The group of AIS patients.

The age of Group 1,

Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4 is 64.11±1.07, 66.80±0.65, 67.38±0.95, 64.09±1.12 years of
old, respectively.

The ages of all of the subjects range from 50 - 80 years of old.

Exposures of UV radiation
UVA lamp (TL-K 40W ACTINIC BL Reflector, Philips, Hamburg, Germany), UVB
lamp (TL 20W/01 RS NARROWBAND, Philips, Hamburg, Germany), and UVC lamp (TUV
25W /G25 T8, Philips, Hamburg, Germany) were used as the UV sources in our experiments.
C57BL/6SLACBL/6Slac mice, ICR mice, and BALB/cASlac-nu nude mice at the weight
between 18-35 g were used for UVC treatment. C57BL/6SLACBL/6Slac mice at the weight
between 20-30g were used for UVB or UVA treatment.

After the mice were briefly

anesthetized with 3.5% (w/v) chloral hydrate (1 ml /100 g), the ears of the mice were exposed to
UV lamps. The power densities of UVA and UVB were 3.0±0.1 mW/cm2 and 2.1±0.1
mW/cm2, respectively, measured by a UVA/UVB detector (ST-513, UVAB, SENTRY

OPTRONICS CORP., Taiwan, China). The power density of UVC was 0.55±0.05 mW/cm2,
measured by a UVC detector (ST-512, UVC, SENTRY OPTRONICS CORP., Taiwan, China).
The index fingers of human subjects were exposed to a UVC lamp (TUV 25W /G25 T8, Philips,
Hamburg, Germany) at the power density of 2.0±0.1 mW/cm2, with the radiation dosage of 2.4
±0.1 J/cm2.

Imaging of the AF of mouse’s skin
The AF of the ears of the mice were imaged by a two-photon fluorescence microscope
(A1 plus, Nikon Instech Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), with the excitation wavelength of 488 nm and
the emission wavelength of 500 - 530 nm.

The AF was quantified by the following approach:

Sixteen spots with the size of approximately 100 X 100 m2 on the scanned images were
selected randomly.

After the average AF intensities of each layer were calculated, the sum of

the average AF intensities of all layers of each spot was calculated, which is defined as the AF
intensity of each spot.

If the value of average AF intensity of certain layer is below 45, the AF

signal of the layer is deemed background noise, which is not counted into the sum.
The AF spectra of the mice was determined by using a two-photon fluorescence
microscope (A1 plus, Nikon Instech Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).

After the imaging, the images

were analyzed automatically. The index fingers of human subjects were imaged under a
confocal fluorescence microscope (TCS SP5Ⅱ, Lecia, Wetzlar, Germany). The excitation
wavelength was 488 nm and the emission wavelength was 500 - 550 nm. Eight spots with the
size of approximately 200 X 200 m2 on the scanned images were selected randomly, which
were used for calculations of the AF intensities of the fingers.

In some studies where noted, after the ears of C57BL/6SLAC mouse were irradiated with
UVC, the ears were collected, which were imaged under a confocal fluorescence microscope
(TCS SP5Ⅱ, Lecia, Wetzlar, Germany). The excitation wavelength was 488 nm and the
emission wavelength was 500-550 nm.

The AF was quantified by using the following

protocol: Sixteen spots with the size of approximately 100 X 100 m2 on the scanned images
were selected randomly. The average AF intensities of the 16 spots were quantified. The
average value of the 16 AF intensities was defined as the AF intensity of the sample.

The excitation wavelength is 485 nm, and the

For all of the human subjects, the AF intensity in the

following seven regions on both hands, i.e., fourteen regions in total, was determined, including
the Index Fingernails, Ventroforefingers, Dorsal Index Finger, Centremetacarpus, Dorsal
Centremetacarpus, Ventribrachium and Dorsal Antebrachium.

Determinations of the AF spectrum of human’s skin
By using a portable equipment for AF spectrum determinations, we determined the
spectra of the AF of the 12 regions of the skin of the human subjects.

Western blot assays
The lysates of the skin were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The protein
concentrations of the samples were quantified using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce
Biotechonology, Rockford, IL, USA). As described previously28, a total of 50 μg of total protein

poly-L-lysine coated slides and stored at room temperature. The skin sections were incubated in
Xylene three times.

The sections were then sequentially dehydrated in 100% EtOH, 95%

EtOH and 70% EtOH.

After two washes with PBS, the sections were blocked in 10% goat

serum for 1 hr, which were then incubated in monoclonal Anti-Cytokeratin 1 (ab185628, abcam,
Cambridge, UK) (1:1000 dilution), containing 1% goat serum at 4 °C overnight. After three
washes in PBS, the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit lgG (1:1000
dilution) (Invitrogen, CA,USA) for 1 hr in darkness at RT, followed by staining in 0.2% DAPI
solution (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu Province, China) for 5 min.

Subsequently the sections

were mounted in Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu Province,
China).

To compare the intensity of fluorescence in each sample, at least three randomly

picked fields in each section were photographed under a Leica microscope.

0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
1) UV dose-dependently increased the epidermal green AF at the stratum spinosum of
C57BL/6SLAC mice’s ears
We determined the spectra of both the basal and the UVC-induced AF of C57BL/6SLAC
mice, ICR mice and nude mice, showing that the spectra of these three strains of mice were
similar, reaching maximal AF intensity at 470 - 500 nm when the excitation wavelength was 800
nm under a two-photon fluorescence microscope (Figure 1a).

We further investigated the

effects of UVC on the skin’s green AF of C57BL/6SLAC mice’ ears, showing that the green AF
intensity of the skin was does-dependently increased by 0.33, 0.66 and 0.99 J/cm2 UVC,
assessed at 1, 6, or 24 hrs after the UVC exposures (Figures 1b and 1c). The green AF
intensity had virtually linear relationships with the UVC dosages at 1 (r1h = 0.9478), 6 (r6h =
0.9448) and 24 hrs (r24h = 0.9623) after the UVC exposures.

Exposures of the ears’ skin of ICR

mice or nude mice to UVC also led to significant increases in the green AF (Figures 1d and 1e).
Orthographic green AF images of C57BL/6SLAC mice’s skin were taken to investigate the
locations of the UVC-induced green AF: The UVC-induced AF increases occurred only at
certain layer of the skin with the thickness of approximately 10 m, which is approximately 10 20 m apart from the outer surface of the epidermis (Figure 1f). Our H&E staining of the skin
showed that the thickness of the epidermis is approximately 25 - 30 m, while the thickness of
the stratum corneum is less that 3 m (Supplemental Figure 1), suggesting that the source of

the AF is located between the stratum corneum and the dermis.

The spatial distribution of the

UVC-induced AF is distinctly polyhedral (Figures 1b and 1d), exhibiting the characteristic
structure of the suprabasal keratinocytes at the stratum spinosum of the epidermis.
We determined the effects of UVC on the green AF of B16-F10 cells - a melanoma cell
line: UVC dose-dependently increased the green AF intensity of the cells (Figures 1g – 1h).
The AF intensity had virtually linear relationships with the UVC dosages at 0.3 (r0.3h = 0.9478),
1 (r1h = 0.9448) and 6 hrs (r6h = 0.9623) after the UVC exposures. UVC also significantly
increased the green AF intensity of the Ventroforefinger’s skin of human subjects (Figures 1i, 1j
and 1k).
Exposures of the ears of C57BL/6SLAC mice to 1.3 and 2.6 J/cm2 UVB also led to
dose-dependent increases in the green AF, assessed at 6 and 24 hrs after the exposures
(Supplemental Figures 2a and 2b). The AF intensity had virtually linear relationships with
the UVB dosage at 6 (r6h = 0.9997) and 24 hr (r24h = 0.9742) after the UVB exposures.
Exposures of the ears of C57BL/6SLAC mice to UVA at the dosage of 5.4 J/cm2 led to a
significant AF increase at 24 hrs after the exposures (Supplemental Figures 2c and 2d).

The

AF intensity also had virtually linear relationships with the UVA dosages at 6 (r6h = 0.9741) and
24 hr (r24h = 0.9361) after the UVA exposures.

The spectra of UVC-, UVB-, and UVA-induced

AF were similar, reaching its peak at 470 - 480 nm when the excitation wavelength was 800 nm
under a two-photon microscope (Supplemental Figure 2e).

2) Evidence suggesting that keratin 1 is the major source of the UV-induced epidermal
green AF of C57BL/6SLAC mice’s ear

The spectrum of the UV-induced green AF is distinctly different from that of NADH 29,30,
thus excluding the possibility that NADH is responsible for the UV-induced green AF.

Our

observation that the UVC-induced green AF mainly occurs in the stratum spinosum argues
against the possibility that FAD is responsible for the UV-induced AF increases, considering
that FAD is an ubiquitous molecule.

Moreover, UVC produced a significant decrease in the

FAD level of the skin of C57BL/6SLAC’s ears at 1 hr after the UVC exposures (Supplemental
Figure 3), when UVC significantly increased the AF intensity (Figures 2b and 2c), arguing
further against the possibility that FAD is responsible for the UVC-induced AF increase.
Because UVC can induce significant increases in the AF of the skin of ICR mice’s ears (Figure
1e), a strain of albino mice that are melanin-deficient
responsible for the UVC-induced increase in the AF.

31

, it is unlikely that melanin is

Moreover, our observation that

Deoxyadenosine (DA), a competitive melanin synthesis inhibitor, did not affect the
UVC-induced increase in the green AF of B16-F10 cells (data not shown) further excludes the
possibility that melanin is responsible for the increased AF.

Collectively, the discussion above

has implicated that epidermal keratins may be responsible for the UV-induced epidermal green
AF, since melanin, FAD, NADH and keratins are four major known epidermal fluorophores4.
Several lines of evidence has suggested that K1 and K10 may be the two major potential
sources of the UV-induced epidermal green AF: First, the spectrum of the UV-induced green AF
(Figure 1a) matches that of the keratins’ AF

32

.

Second, the spatial distribution of the

UV-induced AF exhibits the characteristic structure of the suprabasal keratinocytes at the
stratum spinosum (Figures 1b and 1d), in which K1 and K10 are the major keratins

.

Third, K1-K10 heterodimers, the major existing form of K1 and K10 in the suprabasal

keratinocytes, form the unique, highly dense bundles that are parallel with the cell membranes
of the suprabasal cells

33 34

.

Our TEM study on the ear’s epidermis of C57BL/6SLAC mice

has also found polyhedral structures and dense bundles in the layers between the stratum
corneum and the dermis (Supplemental Figure 4).

Moreover, immunostaining of the skin of

C57BL/6SLAC mice’s ears using anti-K1 antibody also showed polyhedral structure of the
K1-positive regions (Supplemental Figure 5).

This unique spatial distribution of the K1-K10

heterodimers matches well with the spatial distribution of the UVC-induced green AF (Figures
1b and 1d).
We determined the levels of K1 and K10 in the ear’s skin of C57BL/6SLAC mice and
nude mice, and in B16-F10 cells and HaCaT cells - two widely used skin cell lines.

In the ears

of C57BL/6SLAC mouse and nude mouse, K10 existed mainly in the 60 kDa form and 54 kDa
form, respectively (Figures 2a and 2b), while there was only a very low level of K10 in HaCaT
cells (Figures 2a and 2b). There was a 67 kDa band of K1 in HaCaT cells (Figures 2a and
2b).

In contrast, under the normal denaturing conditions for Western Blot analyses on the

samples prepared from the C57BL/6SLAC mouse’s ears, nude mouse’s ears and B16-F10 cells,
the K1 antibody recognized two bands at 127 kDa and 67 kDa, respectively, with the 127 kDa
band as the predominant band (Figures 2a and 2b). Two lines of evidence has suggested that
the K1-containing band of 127 kDa is the K1-K10 heterodimer: First, it is established that K1
and K10 form heterodimers through covalent binding in the stratum spinosum 35, which may be
dissociated when urea concentration is in molar range 33; and second, the sum of the molecular
weight of K1 and K10 is approximately 127 kDa.
We determined the K1 and K10 levels of the ears and back of both C57BL/6SLAC mice
13

and nude mice: The level of the K1-K10 heterodimers in the skin of C57BL/6SLAC mice’s
back was only approximately 6% of that of C57BL/6SLAC mice’s ears, while the levels of the
K1-K10 heterodimers in both the ears and back of nude mice’s are significantly higher than
those in C57BL/6SLAC mice’s ears and back (Figures 2c and 2d).

There was the K10 of

both 60 kDa and 54 kDa in the ears and back of nude mice, while there was only the K10 of 60
kDa in both the ear and the back of C57BL/6SLAC mice (Figures 2c and 2d).
We determined both the basal and UVC-induced epidermal green AF of C57BL/6SLAC
mice’s ears and back: While UVC induced a significant increase in the green AF of
C57BL/6SLAC mice’s ears, UVC did not significantly affect the green AF of C57BL/6SLAC
mice’s back (Figures 2e and 2f).

In contrast, UVC induced significant increases in the green

AF of both the ears and the back of nude mice (Figures 2e and 2f).

There was no significant

difference among the FAD levels in the ears and the back of C57BL/6SLAC mice and nude
mice (Supplemental Figure 6). Together with the above-stated evidence suggesting that K1
and K10 are two major potential sources of the UVC-induced epidermal green AF, our
observation that the presence of K10 with virtual absence of K1 is associated with the absence
of the UVC-induced epidermal green AF in C57BL/6SLAC mouse’s back has suggested that
K1, but not K10, is the major source of the UVC-induced epidermal green AF.
We further applied laser-based technology to deliver K1 siRNA into the skin of
C57BL/6SLAC mice’s ears to determine the role of K1 in the UVC-induced AF.

The laser

treatment led to marked increases in the fluorescent signal of Cy5-labeled siRNA inside the skin
(Supplemental Figure 7), suggesting the effectiveness of the siRNA delivery. Our Western
blot assays showed that the laser-based K1 siRNA administration led to a significant decrease in

results (Figure 2i).

Immunostaining of the skin showed similar

The K1 siRNA administration led to a significant reduction of the

UVC-induced AF intensity (Figures 2j and 2k).

3) UVC-generated ROS produces K1 degradation that can lead to increased epidermal
green AF and cell death
Our study showed that UVC induced a significant decrease in the K1 of 127 kDa 30 min
after the ears of C57BL/6SLAC mice were exposed to 0.33 J/cm2 or 0.66 J/cm2 UVC (Figures
3a and 3b). UVC also produced a significant decrease in the K1 levels of B 16 cells (Figures
3c and 3d). These findings have suggested that K1 degradation, instead of K1 increase, is
associated with the UVC-induced AF increase.

E-64, a broad spectrum cysteine protease

inhibitor, significantly attenuated the UVC-induced increase in the epidermal green AF of
C57BL/6SLAC mice’s ear (Figures 3e and 3f), suggesting that UVC induces increased
epidermal green AF by producing K1 degradation.

E-64 administration also prevented

UVC-induced K1 degradation (Supplemental Figures 8a and 8b).
Our AF imaging study showed that topical administration of 3 or 7.5 mg/cm2 N-acetyl
cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, led to a significant decrease in the 0.66 J/cm2 UVC-induced
epidermal AF of the C57BL/6SLAC mice’s ears 1 hr after the UVC exposures (Figures 3g and
3h).

The UVC-induced K1 degradation was also prevented by the NAC administration

(Figures 3i and 3j).
In the skin cell lines that have K1 monomers only, UVC also induced increased green AF:
There was a selective increase in the K1 monomers in the B16-F10 cells overexpressing K1

with Flag at its C-terminus (Supplemental Figure 9a), in which a marked increase in green AF
was induced by UVC (Supplemental Figure 9b). UVC also produced a marked decrease in
the levels of K1 monomers of the cells overexpressing the Flagged-K1 (Supplemental Figure
9a).
We further determined the effects of decreased K1 levels on B16-F10 cell survival,
showing that K1 siRNA, but not K10 siRNA, dose-dependently induced early-stage (Annexin
V+/AAD-) and late-stage apoptosis (Annexin V+/AAD+) as well as necrosis (Annexin V-/AAD+)
of the cells (Figures 3k – 3l). K1 siRNA, but not K10 siRNA, also induced increases in the
fluorescence intensity of both dichlorofluorescein (DCF) (Figure 3m) and ethidium (Figure 3n)
of the cells - two fluorescent markers of ROS, suggesting that decreased K1 may induce the cell
death at least partially by exacerbating oxidative stress.

4) LPS and oxidative stress can induce increased green AF of the skin of C57BL/6SLAC
mice’ ears or B16-F10 cells, respectively
The skin’s green AF of C57BL/6SLAC mice’s ears was determined at 1 hr, 1 day, 3 day
and 7 day after the mice were administered with 1 mg/kg LPS by i.p. injection.

LPS induced

significant increases in the green AF at all of these time points (Figures 4a and 4b). We also
determined the effects of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg LPS on the green AF, showing that LPS
dose-dependently induced increases in the green AF, assessed at both 3 (Figures 4c and 4d) and
7 days (Figures 4e and 4f) after the LPS administration.

The AF intensity had linear

relationships with the LPS dosages at both 3 days (R2 = 0.9697) and 7 days
after the LPS administration.

(R2 = 0.9889)

These AF images exhibited the characteristic polyhedral

spinosum. We also found that

H2O2

concentration-dependently increased the green AF intensity of B16-F10 cells (Figures 4g – 4h).
The AF intensity also had linear relationships with the H2O2 concentrations at both 0.3 mM
H2O2 (R2 = 0.9897) and 0.5 mM H2O2 (R2 = 0.9739).

5) The green AF intensity of skin is highly correlated with the risk of CSVD patients to
develop AIS
We further determined the green AF intensity of the skin of healthy controls, the CSVD
patients at either low-risk or high-risk to develop AIS, and AIS patients.

In the Dorsal Index

Fingers of certain AIS patients, there were characteristic green AF structures that were similar
with those observed in the UVC-exposed ears’ skin of C57BL/6SLAC mice (data not shown),
suggesting that at least for Dorsal Index Fingers of AIS patients, the green AF also existed in the
stratum spinosum of human’s epidermis. The epidermal green AF intensity at both right (R2 =
0.9997) and left Dorsal Index Fingers (R2 = 0.9884) was highly correlated with the risk level of
the CSVD patients to develop AIS (Figures 5a and 5b).

The epidermal green AF intensity at

both right (R2 = 0.9530) and left Ventroforefinger (R2 = 0.9979) was also highly correlated with
the risk level of the CSVD patients to develop AIS (Figures 5a and 5b).
There was marked variability in the basal AF intensity of the various regions of the skin
of healthy people (Figures 5c and 5d), the CSVD patients (Figures 5e and 5f) and the AIS
patients (Figures 5g and 5h). The variability did not appear to be associated with sunshine
exposures, since the AF intensity of the Ventroforefinger was significantly higher than that of
Dorsal Index Fingers on either left side or right side in all of these groups.

healthy group, the extent of the variability of the AIS group was markedly higher: The
difference between the AF intensity of Ventroforefinger and Ventriantebrachium on the right
and left side of AIS patients was approximately 150% and 70%, respectively, while the
difference between the AF intensity of Ventroforefinger and Ventriantebrachium on the right
and left side of healthy people was approximately 20% and 40%, respectively.

Discussion
Since inflammation and oxidative stress are two common key pathological factors in
organ injury, it is of critical significance to search for biomarkers for non-invasive evaluation of
the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in the body.

Since epidermal AF may be

affected by the ROS and inflammatory factors that are transported through such pathways as the
blood circulation, changes of epidermal AF may become the first biomarker of the ROS and
inflammatory factors in the body.

Our current study has suggested that epidermal green AF

may become the first endogenous indicator of the levels of ROS and inflammatory factors to
which the skin is exposed: First, epidermal green AF intensity has virtually linear relationships
with the dosages of UV and LPS in mouse model studies; green AF intensity has virtually linear
relationships with dosages of ROS in skin cell cultures; and the green AF intensity of human’s
skin is also highly correlated with the risk of CSVD patients to develop AIS.

For healthy skin,

the ROS and inflammatory factors to which the skin is exposed should come from such
pathways as the blood circulation. Therefore, epidermal green AF may also become the first
biomarker of the levels of oxidative stress and inflammation in the body.
Our study has also suggested that increased epidermal green AF is a strong indicator of

‘real damage levels’ of cells and tissues:

First, our study has indicated that K1 degradation

mediates the UV-induced increases in the green AF intensity. The findings indicating critical
biological functions of K1 and the observation showing perinatal lethality of K1-knockout mice
10

have suggested that K1 degradation may lead to tissue and cellular damage.

Indeed, our

study has indicated that decreased K1 levels can lead to both apoptosis and necrosis of a skin
cell line. Second, our findings showing virtually linear relationships between the intensity of
UV-, LPS- and ROS-induced green AF and the dosages of these pathological insults have also
suggested that the epidermal green AF is an indicator of ‘real damage levels’ of cells and tissues,
since it is established that these pathological insults can dose-dependently produce cellular and
tissue damage.
Our previous studies have indicated that the patients of each of the five diseases we have
studied, including AIS

36

, MI

37

, stable coronary artery disease

37

, Parkinson’s disease

38

and

lung cancer 39 patients have their characteristic patterns of green AF in multiple skin locations,
which was defined as ‘Pattern of AF’.

‘Pattern of AF’ is formed by several major properties of

the green AF of the skin, including AF intensity, AF asymmetry, locations with the AF changes
and structure of the green AF images.

By generalizing the properties of the skin’s green AF of

the patients of each disease, as we have studied on the five major diseases36,37,38,39, we may
establish the unique ‘Pattern of AF’ of each disease, which may be used to provide non-invasive
diagnosis of the diseases.
However, the mechanisms underlying the ‘Pattern of AF’-based diagnostic approach
have remained unclear.

and diabetes 56-58. Therefore, we proposed that the increased green AF in the patients’ skin

of the diseases may result from the elevated oxidative stress and inflammation in their body.
Blood circulation is the leading pathway by which ROS and inflammatory factors may be
transported along the body. However, our findings regarding the remarkable variability of the
AF increases in the skin of the AIS and CSVD patients have argued against the possibility that
the blood circulation is the pathway by which ROS and inflammatory factors are transmitted to
the locations of the skin: If were the AF increases produced by the ROS and inflammatory
factors in the blood circulation, the green AF intensity in the various locations of the human
skin would be relatively homogeneous.
We have proposed the hypothesis that ROS and inflammatory factors might be
transported along the Meridian System (‘Channel System’), the pivotal system in Chinese
medicine, that links the locations of the skin to the damaged organ 36:

The damaged organ in a

certain disease could produce significant levels of oxidative stress and inflammation, which
may be transported along the Meridian System that corresponds to the organ, leading to
‘Blockage’ (‘Yu Du’ in Chinese) of the system.

The ROS and inflammatory factors that are

transported along the channel may diffuse into the suprabasal layer of the epidermis, leading to
keratin degradation and subsequent increases in the epidermal green AF.

Therefore, different

injury levels of a certain organ may lead to differential changes of the green AF at various
locations of the skin along the Meridian System that corresponds to the organ, forming its
20

characteristic ‘Pattern of AF’.

We have obtained significant evidence supporting this

hypothesis, e.g., there were marked and selective increases in the skin’s green AF at certain
locations for both lung cancer patients39 and professional swimmers

59

.

However, extensive

future studies are required to further test the validity of this hypothesis.

If this hypothesis is

demonstrated, our understanding on the scientific basis of Chinese medicine would be
profoundly enhanced.

This demonstration would also provide an essential linkage between

Western medicine and Chinese medicine.
Based on these pieces of information, we have proposed our novel theory for
non-invasive evaluation of organ injury - ‘Pattern of AF Theory for Organ Injury’ (Figure 6):
Injury of a certain organ can release major pathological factors such as ROS and inflammatory
factors, which may be transported along the Meridian System that links to the organ. The
ROS and inflammatory factors can induce keratin degradation of the epidermis nearby the
Meridian System, leading to increased green AF intensity at those locations of the skin.
Therefore, each different injury level of a certain organ can lead to differential changes of green
AF at various locations of the skin along the Meridian System, forming its characteristic
‘Pattern of AF’.

By determining the ‘Pattern of AF’, we can evaluate non-invasively the injury

level of a certain organ.
Our green AF-based method for evaluating pathological state is essentially a ‘organ
damage-detection method’, which can provide not only non-invasive diagnosis of numerous
diseases, but also non-invasive evaluation of sub-health conditions as well as therapeutic effects
on numerous diseases. Our ‘organ damage-detection method’ has also surpassed previous
methods of ‘risk evaluation’.

For example, since our AF-based approach may determine the
21

injury levels of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular system, our approach may have profoundly
higher precision in evaluating the risk of a person to develop AIS or MI than previously used
methods.
Our study has also exposed several novel biological and pathological properties of
keratins: First, our finding showing that UVC can induce K1 degradation by such mechanisms
as increasing oxidative stress and cysteine protease activity, together with our finding showing
the capacity of decreased K1 to induce oxidative stress as well as apoptosis and necrosis of cells,
have suggested a novel mechanism underlying UV-induced skin damage Degradation-Mediated

the

‘Keratin

Skin Damage Theory for UV-Induced Skin Damage’ (Figure 7). These

findings may also shed light for elucidating the pathological mechanisms underlying the K1
mutations-associated inherited skin diseases. Second, our study has indicated novel properties
of epidermal keratins’ AF: In addition to its basal AF, epidermal keratins’ AF can also be
induced by such pathological insults as UV, inflammation and ROS, in which K1 is a key factor.
Most previous studies regarding AF applications in disease diagnosis have determined basal AF
only.

Our study has suggested that determinations of both basal AF and ‘induced AF’ may

provide significantly richer information for the biomedical applications of epidermal keratins’
AF.

Third, epidermal keratins’ AF have extensive biological significance: It is not only a

biomarker for indicating the pathological damage of skin, but also a novel, common biomarker
for organ damage.

Moreover, since it is established that UV exposures at a certain time point

can dose-dependently produce skin damage in the future, our finding that the dosages of UV
have virtually linear relationships with the epidermal green AF intensity has suggested that the
AF intensity may also become the first biomarker for predicating UV-induced skin damage.

Furthermore, our study has suggested profound variability of the biological properties of
keratins in different parts of mice’s body and different strains of mice, which have highlighted
the complexity of both epidermal keratins and the skin.
