Abstract

30

DNA from formalin-preserved tissue could unlock a vast repository of genetic information stored in

31

museums worldwide. However, formaldehyde crosslinks proteins and DNA, and prevents ready

32

amplification and DNA sequencing. Formaldehyde acylation also fragments the DNA. Treatment with

33

proteinase K proteolyzes crosslinked proteins to rescue the DNA, though the process is quite slow. To

34

reduce processing time and improve rescue efficiency, we applied the mechanical energy of a vortex

35

fluidic device (VFD) to drive the catalytic activity of proteinase K and recover DNA from American lobster

36

tissue (Homarus americanus) fixed in 3.7% formalin for >1-year. A scan of VFD rotational speeds

37

identified the optimal rotational speed for recovery of PCR-amplifiable DNA and while 500+ base pairs

38

were sequenced, shorter read lengths were more consistently obtained. This VFD-based method also

39

effectively recovered DNA from formalin-preserved samples. The results provide a roadmap for exploring

40

DNA from millions of historical and even extinct species.

41

Introduction

42

Archived biological samples offer an important source of genetic information for diverse fields including

43

evolutionary biology, ecology, phylogenetics, biodiversity, and epidemiology [1-2]. Samples, from

44

hydrated tissues to whole organisms, have historically been preserved in aqueous formaldehyde (3.7 to

45

4% solution of formaldehyde in water, termed formalin). In many cases, these specimens are the only

46

remaining samples that could provide genetic information about the organisms, including their

47

microbiomes, environments, diets, and other attributes – all from the moment of sample preservation [3-

48

5]. This preservative, however, hinders DNA amplification and sequencing with the sample [6]. Thus, new

49

methods to recover DNA from formalin-fixed specimens could advance our ability to access the genetic

50

information in these samples, and advance our understanding of how organisms and ecosystems have

51

responded to natural and anthropogenic changes over time. For example, formalin-fixed specimens in

52

natural history museums could be used to elucidate the impact of environmental changes on the DNA of

53

biological populations [1-2, 7]. DNA sequencing of such samples could address longitudinal, biological

54

questions that may be impractical to address without the genetic information for the preserved specimens

55

[2, 8-9].

56

For >150 years, formalin fixation has been used to effectively preserve hydrated specimens [7]. A

57

vast repository of formalin-fixed samples exists, including at least 400 million samples at 13 large

58

institutions [1]. Marine organisms are particularly well-preserved in this aqueous preservative, as it retains

59

morphological features well, enabling more detailed taxonomic studies. Aqueous formaldehyde is also

60

advantageous in that it stops parasitic microbial growth [10]. However, preserving samples in formalin

61

fixation damages DNA [11-12]. Covalent modification of DNA bases by the electrophilic formaldehyde

62

drives base deglycosylation, and the resultant abasic sites in DNA can cause strand breakage [13].

63

Additionally, long duration storage often incurs DNA fragmentation, independent of formalin [14].

64

Fragments from both mechanisms increase the amount of DNA template required for PCR amplification

65

of longer targets, and can also inhibit PCR [15-16].

66

Intrastrand and protein-DNA crosslinks introduced by formaldehyde can also block PCR and DNA

67

sequencing [17-18]. Protein-DNA crosslinks result from nucleophilic attack on formaldehyde by proteins’

68

primary amines to yield imines and iminium ions. These groups can then react with the less nucleophilic

69

primary amines of DNA bases, particularly from guanine, resulting in a protein-DNA crosslink (Fig 1) [19-

70

20]. Due to the high density of amines found on the surface of proteins and DNA, each DNA-protein

71

complex can become crosslinked multiple times. Additionally, formalin-fixed cells cannot repair the slow

72

process of cytosine deamination to uracil [11, 21]. During PCR amplification, adenine can be incorporated

73

as the incorrect complement to degraded cytosine, resulting in point mutations [11]. In summary, DNA

74

damage caused by preservation results in short templates for PCR and low-quality, error-prone DNA

75

sequences.

79

carbonyl to yield an iminium ion, which can then react with another primary amine from DNA, RNA, or

80

proteins to form a crosslink. This crosslink reaction is in reversible dynamic equilibrium [10, 21]. (B)

81

Treatment with a protease, proteinase K, allows free DNA (fDNA) recovery. Here, Nuc designates an

83

Despite the immense challenges that are associated with formalin fixation, much effort has been

84

dedicated to developing techniques for sequencing these irreplaceable samples (DNA recovery methods

85

from formalin-fixed tissue are summarized in Table 1). Most current methods for recovering DNA from

86

formalin-fixed organisms use proteinase K, a thermostable serine protease with broad substrate

87

specificity [22], to digest crosslinked proteins and eliminate most crosslink-associated blockages [21-23].

88

However, even at the enzyme’s optimum temperature (49 ± 2 °C), the free DNA (fDNA) recovery rate

89

from this method is low at approximately 4.4% per hour; additionally, the enzyme’s half-life is limiting at

90

approximately 11.3 h [21-22]. At room temperature (≈22 °C), the proteolytic reaction rate yields only 1.1%

91

fDNA per hour [24]. DNA can also be recovered from formalin-fixed tissue with a 0.1 M NaOH (pH 12)

92

buffer treatment at 120 °C for 25 min [7, 25]. However, these harsh conditions can further damage the

93

DNA through Brønsted base-caused strand cleavage; therefore, this approach is most valuable in cases

94

where there is an excess of tissue to be digested, and is highly inappropriate for most delicate, longer-

95

preserved samples. Notably, the current reactions to liberate DNA are harsh, low-throughput, low

96

yielding, and time consuming. Mild methods to increase DNA recovery and purification for PCR

97

amplification and subsequent DNA sequencing could revolutionize the study of a wide range of museum

98

specimens.

We posit that judicious application of mechanical energy could address this challenge.

103

Specifically a vortex fluidic device (VFD) directs controlled mechanical energy into solution to accelerate

104

enzyme-catalyzed reactions [29]. This thin film microfluidic platforms can disrupt membranes and drive

105

protein folding [30], and potentially assist with the deaggregation, and solubilization of formalin-fixed

106

samples in addition to acceleration of enzyme activity. Here, we tested the efficacy of using a VFD to

107

accelerate proteinase K activity, and increase the process throughput and efficiency of extracting DNA

108

from formalin-fixed specimens (Fig 2). Thus, we optimized the recovery of fDNA from formalin-fixed

109

specimens through VFD and post-processing purification. Our results suggest that this method recovers

110

fDNA with 40 to 85% greater yields than conventional methods without requiring harsh conditions, and

111

can decrease treatment time from days to hours.

Procedure

143

Tissue sample preparation. Timing: ≈1 h

144

1. After removal of a small portion (≈5 to 10 g) of the preserved biological tissue from the preservative,

145

immerse the tissue in liquid nitrogen until frozen, and grind with a mortar and pestle for ≈1 min. The

146

small pieces of ground tissue are aliquoted (≈1 to 1.5 g) into Eppendorf tubes (henceforth termed

147

tubes).

148

Safety Note: Exercise caution when utilizing a sharp edge to prevent puncturing or cutting personal

149

protective equipment or skin.

150

Pause Point: At this stage, the sample can be stored at -80 °C for later processing.

151

2. On an autoclaved glass surface, mince the formalin-fixed tissue sample with a flame-sterilized

152

razorblade held by a sterilized hemostat for ≈5 min.

153

Safety Note: Exercise caution when utilizing a sharp edge to prevent puncturing or cutting personal

154

protective equipment or skin.

155

Critical Step: This step increases the surface area to volume ratio of the tissue and, thus, improves

156

the proteinase K access to the sample.

157

3. To remove the preservative fluid, wash the sample three times with the proteolysis buffer (1 mL). For

158

each wash step, briefly vortex, centrifuge (15 krcf, 3 min), and decant the samples. If required, an

159

addition centrifugation (15 krcf, 1 min) can remove any residual buffer.

160

VFD treatment. Timing: ≈1 h

161

4. Transfer the ground, minced tissue to the bottom of an autoclaved 20 mm VFD sample tube. Add

162
163

proteolysis buffer (950 µL) and then proteinase K solution (50 µL).
5. Seal the VFD sample tube with a rubber septum, and use the VFD to spin the sample (7 krpm, 1 h,

164

RT).

165

Critical Step: This rotational speed is optimal for fDNA amplification and sequencing.

166

Sample post-processing and purification. Timing: ≈1.5 h

167

6. Following VFD processing, immediately transfer the sample, including both the processed tissue and

168
169
170
171

solution, from the VFD sample tube to a new tube.
7. Immediately, centrifuge the sample (15 krcf, 5 min, RT) to remove the tissue. Transfer the
supernatant to a clean tube.
8. Incubate the supernatant on wet ice for 30 minutes.

172

Critical Step: A white precipitate (SDS) collects at the bottom of the tube. The presence of SDS

173

negatively affects PCR yields and subsequent purification of fDNA.

174

9. Immediately, centrifuge the sample (15 krcf, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove SDS, and transfer the

175

supernatant to a new tube without disturbing the SDS pellet.

176

Critical Step: The supernatant must be transferred immediately following centrifugation to prevent

177

resolubilization of SDS.

178

Pause Point: At this stage, the sample may be frozen at -20 or -80 °C for later analysis.

179
180

10. Process 400 µL of the supernatant with a Zymo DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

181

fDNA quantification and characterization. Timing: ≈8 h

182

11. The isolated fDNA can be used for further amplification, characterization, quantification, and

183

sequencing.

Materials & methods

185

One adult male Lobster (H. americanus) was purchased in February 2017 from a local lobster fishery in

186

Boston, MA. The lobster was euthanized by quickly severing the ganglia behind the eyes with a sharp

187

knife. The body was then placed whole in a solution of 3.7% formaldehyde in 0.9 M phosphate-buffered

188

saline (which approximates the salinity of seawater). The lobster was maintained at room temperature for

189

one month, and then shipped to the University of California Irvine in March 2017. All lobster trails shown

190

here have used muscle recovered from the chelipeds (primary claws), which have remained in formalin

191

for the two-year duration of this study. For experimental treatments, the lobster claw tissue was

192

processed according to the procedure described above.

193
194

Proteinase K (Promega, V3021, lyophilized) was solubilized and diluted to 10 mg/mL in storage
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 50% glycerol, pH 8.0).

195

For DNA isolation, 100 (±1) mg of lobster tissue samples were utilized. Tissue preparation, VFD

196

processing, and DNA purification used methods described above. In the experiments reported here, the

197

VFD was operated in the confined, not continuous flow, mode [32-33]; specifically, 1 mL volumes were

198

used. The negative control samples consisted of identical tissue samples and treatment but were not

199

subjected to VFD processing. A positive control contained VFD-processed fresh lobster tissue.

200

Additionally, fixed and fresh lobster tissue were processed overnight at 56 °C without the VFD for the

201

conventional method controls, based on Table 1. Finally, intermediate controls combined the conventional

202

and VFD-mediated methods to minimize the number of variables changed per experiment. These

203

intermediate controls consisted of fixed and fresh lobster processed overnight (as in the conventional

204

method) at room temperature (as in the VFD-mediated method) without use of the VFD.

205

The positive controls for PCR quantification were DNA obtained from fresh (non-formalin-fixed),

206

ground lobster claw tissue. The DNA recovery from this sample applied Chelex 100 Resin (Bio-Rad, 10%

207

w/v in 500 µL in ddH2O) with the manufacturer’s protocol. The mixture of a tissue fragment and resin was

208

vortexed and centrifuged briefly before incubation at 90 to 95 °C for 20 to 35 min. Following another brief

209

vortexing and centrifugation, the supernatant was isolated as the positive control for lobster fDNA.

210

DNA extraction yields were compared by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Bio-Rad iCycler). For PCR,

211

reaction mixtures (10 µL) applied the Phusion DNA polymerase (0.2 U final concentration, New England

212

Biolabs) and buffer (5× diluted final concentration, New England Biolabs), DMSO (10% v/v final

213

concentration), dNTPs (0.5 mM each final concentration, New England Biolabs), primers (8-33 ng each

214

final concentration, Integrated DNA Technologies) (Table 2), and SYBR Green I dye (10,000× diluted final

215

concentration, Thermo Fisher Scientific). A PCR was performed with 1 cycle of 94 °C for 5 min followed

216

by 40 to 50 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for

217

5 min.

The recovered fDNA from the formalin-fixed lobster was quantified by UV-Vis absorbance. The

221

absorbance spectra of the samples, diluted in ddH2O (1:50), were measured (Jasco V-730

222

Spectrophotometer). The spectra were recorded from 200 to 400 nm, in triplicate (technical replicates),

223

with a scanning speed of 200 nm/min and intervals of 0.5 nm with ddH2O as the blank. Two buffer only

224

controls examined the reaction mixture without lobster tissue. The first was processed in the VFD (7.5

225

krpm, 1 h, RT), and the second did not use VFD processing. The 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder (10 µg, 1000 µL)

226

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1.0 µg/µl) was used to estimate DNA sizes and concentrations; a positive

227

control applied DNA from fresh lobster tissue extracted with Chelex 100 Resin, as described above.

228

A SYBR Green I fluorescence assay also quantified the dsDNA concentration [34]. To derive a

229

DNA concentration calibration curve, a 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1.0 µg/µL) was

230

diluted to concentrations of 0 ng/µL to 1.25 ng/µL. These dilutions (100 µL) and SYBR Green I dye (100

231

µL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1250× diluted in ddH2O) were added to a black, clear-bottom 96-well plate

232

(Corning, 3615). The fluorescence of each well was measured (λex 485 nm, λex 550 nm, Bandwidth 20

233

nm, Gain 50). The fluorescence of fDNA from the fixed lobster samples (100× diluted) were similarly

234

measured, and the dsDNA concentrations were estimated using the calibration curve shown in S4 Fig.

Results and discussion

236

Conventional methods applying proteinase K to remove protein-DNA crosslinks require >17 h [26-27],

237

and typically the reaction runs for >1 day. Here we report enzyme acceleration techniques via VFD

238

mechanical stimulation to enable DNA recovery in <2 h from lobster claw tissue (H. americanus)

239

preserved in formalin (3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, a condition iso-osmotic with

240

seawater). Key variables requiring optimization included mechanical breakage of the tissue sample,

241

length of fDNA sequences to be amplified, and rotational speed of the VFD. As observed for other VFD-

242

enhanced enzymes [29], proteinase K activity can be accelerated using a VFD. The approach allows

243

recovery of free DNA (fDNA) from formalin-fixed samples. The rotational speed of the tube in the VFD

244

determines the level of shear, micro-mixing, and fluid dynamics experienced by the thin film of liquid [32].

245

The tilt angle of the VFD can be important, and 45 relative to the horizontal is the optimal tilt angle for a

246

myriad of applications, including accelerating enzymatic reactions [29, 32].

Fig 2. Schematic of the VFD-mediated fDNA recovery technique. (A) The protocol begins with Vortex

249

Fluidic Device (VFD) treatment (7 krpm, room temperature, abbreviated RT, 1 h) of a mixture of

250

proteinase K and the frozen, then broken-up tissue. The reaction mixture is next processed to remove

251

solids and DNA polymerase inhibitors. The recovered fDNA is then purified and concentrated. Finally, the

252

DNA is amplified, quantified, and characterized by (B) qPCR and (C) DNA sequencing of the samples.

253

Larger versions of panels B and C are provided in S1 and S2 Figs. Threshold cycle (Ct) and endpoint

254

fluorescence values are given in S1 Table.

255

Mechanical breakage of the tissue sample emerged as a key variable for efficient and robust

256

isolation of fDNA. Smaller fragments increase the surface area to volume ratio, allowing greater efficiency

257

of proteinase K digestion. Also, the VFD removes solids from solution by centrifugation, and, therefore,

258

breaking the tissue sample into small fragments improves the efficiency of VFD-mediated fDNA recovery.

259

The formalin-fixed tissue was first frozen in liquid nitrogen then ground into small particles using a clean

260

mortar and pestle. When extracted using traditional extraction approaches, the ground material yielded

261

modest and inconsistent quantities of fDNA (Fig 2 and S1 Table). The lack of reproducibility suggested a

262

need for further mechanical breakdown of the tissue. Beadbeating and sonication increased the observed

263

breakdown of tissue, but both methods failed to improve PCR product yields (data not shown). These

264

failures may be due to the fact that sonication or the resultant heat generation through cavitation could

265

introduce additional breaks in the DNA. However, we found that a second, mincing step with a sterile,

266

new razorblade consistently improved fDNA recovery (Fig 4).

267

Also, the length of the amplified DNA proved critical for consistent recovery from formalin-fixed

268

samples. In initial experiments, we amplified a 579 bp sequence of fDNA. The amplified DNA was the

269

correct lobster sequence (Fig 2, Fig 4, and S2 Fig), but this long fragment proved difficult to amplify

270

repeatedly. Thus, primers targeting a 183 bp sequence were used for all further experiments reported

271

here. The shorter target amplicon decreased the chance of DNA fragmentation damaging the sequence

272

and preventing PCR amplification. As expected, DNA sequencing quality in the non-VFD control reactions

273

was difficult to monitor; only three out of thirteen cumulative control amplification reactions yielded fDNA

274

detectable by gel electrophoresis.

275

The final parameter optimized for fDNA extraction was the rotational speed of the VFD. Previous

276

studies with the VFD have demonstrated that acceleration of enzymatic catalysis occurs at rotational

277

speeds between 5 and 9 krpm with the VFD at a 45° tilt angle [29]. Hypotheses attribute the enzymatic

278

acceleration phenomena to two interconnected actions. First, the periodic change in the thickness of the

279

thin fluid film present in the VFD, results in intense micro-mixing and high mass transfer. Second, the

280

Faraday waves arising from this periodic change contribute to zones of high and low pressure within the

281

reaction mixture and, accordingly, the enzyme present in solution. The pressure oscillations could

282

increase substrate accessibility and removal of product from the enzyme active site, which also benefit

283

from the high mass transfer of the VFD.

284

To identify optimal speeds for fDNA recovery, a systematic assessment of rotational speeds

285

between 5 and 9 krpm at intervals of 1 krpm was conducted. Heterogeneity inherent to pulverized tissue

286

imparts idiosyncratic and uncontrollable variables into this optimization and subsequent isolation of fDNA.

287

Thus, the yields of fDNA, as determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, were sometimes inconsistent (It is

288

well known that absorption of 260 nm is a proxy for DNA concentrations in solution, whereas the ratio of

289

absorbances at 260:280 nm serves as an indicator of DNA purity). Though absorbance at 260 nm

290

increased for the VFD-processed samples at various rotational speeds relative to the non-VFD-processed

291

negative control, the ratio of 260:280 nm absorbances was significantly <1.8 for all rotational speeds (Fig

292

3 and S3 Fig), which likely indicates inclusion of protein in the VFD-treated samples [35]. The DNA-

293

associated, absorbance at 260 nm was greatest for the samples processed at 8 krpm. This rotational

294

speed is within the VFD-based rate enhancement zone for reactions in aqueous solvents. That said, the

295

highest, most consistently observed PCR yields were obtained for the rotational speed of the VFD of 7

296

krpm (which is discussed in more detail below; see Fig 2, Fig 4, S1 Fig, S2 Table, and S5 Fig).

samples. The negative control indicates samples not subjected to VFD processing. Buffer only controls

304

lacked lobster tissue. The positive controls included DNA that had not been formalin fixed. Additional

305

controls demonstrated a conventional method and an intermediate method (processing time of the

306

conventional method and temperature of the VFD-mediated method) used to process fixed and fresh

307

tissue without the VFD. The error bars designate the standard deviation for sample measurements at the

308

indicated condition (technical replicates, n = 3).

309

To more robustly quantify the concentration of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the fDNA, a

310

fluorescence-based DNA intercalating assay was performed using SYBR Green I dye. Samples were

311

diluted to reach the dye’s linear range, and the sample fluorescence (λex 485 nm, λem 550 nm) was

312

measured against a standard curve to determine the concentrations of the rescued dsDNA. The assay

313

demonstrated that VFD-processed samples yielded 40 to 85% more dsDNA than the control, non-VFD

314

processed sample (Fig 3). Thus, the VFD improved the rescue of dsDNA from formalin-fixed tissue

315

compared to the non-VFD-treated negative control.

316

Moreover, and most importantly, DNA recovered via VFD-enhanced extraction were amenable to

317

amplification via PCR and quantitative PCR (or qPCR). Post-VFD treatment, samples were purified and

318

concentrated with a Zymo™ DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit, which removes DNA polymerase inhibitors

319

and proteins [16, 36]. Using the fDNA samples and qPCR, we observed reproducible amplification of an

320

183 bp target amplicon from the gene encoding ATP synthase from samples processed with a VFD

321

rotating at either 6 or 7 krpm (Fig 4, Table 2). Paradoxically, these speeds had lower fDNA yields when

322

compared to the 8 krpm (as described above; see Fig 3a-b). However, the 8 krpm treated DNA would

323

amplify <50% of the time (n = 8, shown in S5 Fig). Though yields were greater, the more aggressive

324

treatment is apparently liberating other compounds that can be problematic to PCR amplification (this

325

phenomena has also been seen in algal cells and more) [37]. Additionally, it is plausible that greater VFD

326

rotational speeds could result in both greater yields and further fragmentation of fDNA, which could

327

explain the higher DNA concentrations, but lower amplification efficacy [16].

328

From the formalin-fixed samples, the 7 krpm VFD-processed DNA sample yielded the highest

329

levels of fDNA amplification as measured by qPCR. For example, on average 94±4% of the endpoint

330

positive control fluorescence signal was obtained with a low threshold cycle (Ct) value, averaging

331

35.4±0.7 cycles (S2 Table). Comparatively, the no template controls (NTC) did not surpass the threshold

332

in two of three trials, and their fluorescence averaged 10±10% of the endpoint positive control

333

fluorescence signal (S2 Table). The lower Ct values demonstrated a greater yield of DNA. Furthermore,

334

the PCR product of the fDNA rescued from the 7 krpm VFD-processing condition could readily be

335

sequenced via Sanger sequencing. This sequence exhibited 99.5% homology to the expected sequence

336

[38]. The 6 krpm-processed sample offered a decreased yield of amplified DNA. Notably, PCR

337

amplification failed for the non-VFD-treated sample.

338

The data herein illustrate the efficacy of our new VFD-enabled method for fDNA recovery. We

339

have demonstrated the successful amplification of fDNA from biological specimens treated with

340

formaldehyde. We have also shown that fDNA can be used to great effect with appropriately designed

341

qPCR assays. Therefore, we are optimistic that this method presents a potentially valuable method for

342

increasing the throughput of fDNA recovery. Increasing the rate at which fDNA can be recovered is a

343

timely pursuit, as there are tens of millions of formalin-fixed samples stored in museums around the world.

344

These organisms provide a “time capsule” of sorts, revealing the genomic adaptations of organisms to a

345

pre-industrial world. Indeed, museum specimens may become our first tool for understanding the extent

346

to which anthropogenic factors are shaping our biosphere. It is also important to note that fDNA is,

347

unfortunately, subject to irreparable damage and fragmentation, and any PCR-based amplification from

348

such samples will always be highly dependent on rescue conditions, primer design (especially amplicon

349

length), tissue mincing, and other factors. The VFD method here may help investigators tap into this

350

enormous genetic repository.
