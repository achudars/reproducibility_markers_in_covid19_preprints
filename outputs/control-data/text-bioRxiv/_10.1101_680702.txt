ABSTRACT

Scaffolds composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) can assist tissue remodeling
and repair following injury. The ECM is a complex biomaterial composed of
proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans, secreted by
cells. The ECM contains fundamental biological cues that modulate cell behavior
and serves as a structural scaffold for cell adhesion and growth. For clinical
applications, where immune rejection is a constraint, ECM can be processed
using decellularization methods intended to remove cells and donor antigens
from tissue or organs, while preserving native biological cues essential for cell
growth and differentiation. Recent studies show bioengineered organs composed
by a combination of a diversity of materials and stem cells as a possibility of new
therapeutic strategies to treat diseases that affect different tissues and organs,
including the central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, the methodologies
currently described for brain decellularization involve the use of several chemical
reagents with many steps that ultimately limit the process of organ or tissue
recellularization. Here, we describe for the first time a fast and straightforward
method for complete decellularization of mice brain by the combination of rapid
freezing and thawing following the use of only one detergent (Sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)). Our data show that using the protocol we describe here the brain
can be entirely decellularized, while still maintaining ECM components that are
essential for cell survival and repopulation of the scaffold. Our results also show
the repopulation of the decellularized brain matrix with Neuro2a cells, that were
identified by immunohistochemistry in their undifferentiated form. We conclude

that this novel and simple method for brain decellularization can be used as a
biocompatible scaffold for cell repopulation.
Key Words: decellularization; brain; scaffold

Impact Statement
For the first time we describe an easy, effective and low cost method for complete
decellularization of murine brain by the use of only one detergent (SDS)
combined with rapid freezing and thawing, that can be used as a 3D scaffold for
cell culture of neuronal cells. The results show that the decellularized brains still
maintain ECM components essential for cell survival and repopulation of the
scaffold. Moreover, we found that the decellularized brain matrix can be
repopulated with neural cells, showing its biocompatibility.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic diseases represent a burden to the individuals as well as to the
health systems worldwide. Recently, several strategies have been developed to
better understand and eventually treat chronic diseases. These strategies
comprehend the establishment of organoids produced from human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC), bioengineered tissues, and decellularized
scaffolds from lungs, hearts, livers, and kidneys (1-5). Despite the great advances
till now, none of these processes can reproduce with high fidelity the full
complexity of a tissue or organ. Combinations of organoids and organ-on-a-chip
technology have been proposed, but still face technical difficulties, including the
correct assemble of a given tissue microenvironment 6. Thus, one of the most
challenging aspects of tissue engineering is to reproduce the correct disposition

of the extracellular matrix (ECM), known not only to support correct cell biology
processes, but in many cases, to drive them. The brain is an emblematic example
of this issue and the production of brain organoids from hiPSC has been
described in the literature by several laboratories

11.

Despite the power of

organoid cultures, there are some limitations such as the lack of full organ
organization and orientation. Furthermore, there is a size limitation to organoids
as they are not vascularized in vitro (12,13).
The solution may lay in the reproduction of the ECM composition, not only
with regard to the types of proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, but also to
their arrangement in the tissue

(14-21).

Decellularization of organs can produce

ECM scaffolds that can be used for stem cell differentiation as an alternative to
organoids. The ECM acts as a support for cells during embryo development,
induces cell differentiation and proliferation, promotes cell adhesion and cell
migration, and provides cues to maintain tissue homeostasis and regeneration.
Similar to organoids, acellular organ substrates combined with patient-derived
stem cells can create a platform for personalized medicine studies

13.

Properly

decellularized organs retain both the structural proteins and biologically active
growth factors that are capable of inducing location-specific differentiation of stem
and progenitor cells (13,22,23).
Tridimensional (3D)-printed scaffolds are an attractive alternative to
decellularized scaffolds. However, it is currently difficult to use this technology to
replicate the intricate ECM structure of complex organs, such as the brain, and

To

produce a bioscaffold, several steps are required in order to achieve complete
decellularization and that can be performed by flushing detergents or enzymes
through to the main artery of the organ. Based on this, several protocols have
been described, but none of them has been shown to be more effective than
other. Moreover, the total removal of cellular and nuclear components is crucial,
as cellular or subcellular fragments left can trigger an immunological response.
On the other hand, biological activity of the remaining ECM and preservation of
the 3D architecture of the tissue, including a wide microvascular system, must be
maintained (24-30).
Generally, two different approaches for cellular repopulation have been
described: (i) infusion of cells via the conserved vascular network and (ii) direct
injection of cells into the ECM

(30-32).

In the present study, we chose the second

approach due to the significant reduction of the brain size after complete
decellularization. Hence, we proposed a new method for decellularized brain
scaffold production that could be used as a template for tissue bioengineering as
the ECM structure is preserved.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Experimental Model
Mice (Mus musculus, C57/Bl6 lineage) weighting 25-30 g, were obtained
from the University’s Animal Facility (CEDEME/UNIFESP). All protocols were
approved by the University’s Committee of Ethics in the Use of Animals (CEUA
#2101180516). Every effort was made to minimize animal suffering and reduce
the number of animals used. For the surgical proceedings, mice were

anesthetized with Ketamine 75 mg/Kg and Xylazine 10 mg/Kg by intraperitoneal
injection. Trichotomy and skin antisepsis were performed in abdominal site with
chlorhexidine-alcohol and sterile cotton gauzes. Mice used to harvest the brain
were placed in a surgical table at 37°C in dorsal decubitus.

Decellularization process
Brains were obtained from adult C57BL/6 mice, placed inside a 2 mL tube
and soaked in liquid nitrogen for 10 min. After this rapid freezing process, the
brains were thawed at room temperature and washed with 10 mM PBS for 5 min.
This freeze-thawing process was done 3 times. After this, each brain was soaked
in a 10 mL solution of 1 % SDS, and agitated for 24 h. The decellularized brains
were washed 3 times with 10 mM PBS for 5 min.

Residual nucleic acid and protein quantitation
Nucleic acid quantitation was performed in samples of 100 mg of
decellularized matrix or control fresh tissue, triturated in 1 mL Trizol (Life
Technologies, USA) using a Polytron Pt 1200 Cl homogenizer (Kinematica AG,
Switzerland). One mL of homogenate was transferred to propylene tubes and
250 µL of chloroform were added. After, tubes were sealed, homogenized and
centrifuged 10000 x g; 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and 300 µL
of ethanol were added, and the mixture was gently homogenized in vortex and
incubated at room temperature for 3 min. The solution was centrifuged 10000 x g;
5 min at room temperature. The DNA pellet was washed twice with 0.1 M citrate
buffer and suspended in 1 mL of 75 % ethanol, incubated for 15 min with
homogenization. The DNA solution was centrifuged at 10000 x g; 5 min at room

temperature and the supernatant was gently removed, the pellet was dried for
5 min under vacuum and 100 µL of DNase free water were added.
DNA and RNA were isolated from native and decellularized tissue to
perform the nucleic acid quantitation. The samples were triturated in 1 mL of
Trizol using a Polytron Pt 1200 Cl homogenizer (Kinematica AG, Littau,
Switzerland). One mL (1 mL) of homogenate was transferred to propylene tubes
and 250 μL of chloroform were added. After, the tubes were sealed, homogenized
and centrifuged 10,000xg, for 15 min at 4° C. The supernatant was discarded and
300 μL of ethanol were added, gently homogenized and incubated at room
temperature for 2-3 min. Centrifuged at 10,000xg, for 5 min at room temperature.
DNA pellet was washed twice with 0,1 M citrate buffer and suspended in 1 mL of
75 % ethanol, incubated for 15 min with periodic homogenization, centrifuged at
10,000 x g, for 5 min at room temperature and the supernatant was gently
removed, dried for 5 min in vacuum and 100 μL of DNase free water were added.
Nucleic acid content was quantified using NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA). DNA and RNA contents were normalized to the initial dry weight
of the samples. Base pair length of residual DNA was determined.
The total protein of the decellularized and non-decellularized brains was
extracted using Mammalian Cell Extraction Kit (Biovision, USA) following the
recommendations of the manufacturer, and after that the protein was quantified
with Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) fluorimeter.

Characterization of decellularized tissues constituents
Decellularized and fresh tissues were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and
embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5 µm) were obtained and used for

histological analysis. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed
according to standard protocol to evaluate the tissue morphology, specially the
absence of residual cellular nuclei in the decellularized tissues, also confirmed
by 4´,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole fluorescent dye (DAPI, 1:1000, Molecular
Probes, USA) staining.
Basal membrane was evaluated by Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining,
and Masson’s trichrome staining was used to stain collagen fibers. Alcian blue
staining was used to evaluate the presence of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and
picrosirius red was used to evaluate the presence of collagens type I, II, and III.
All reagents used for the histological analysis were purchased from SigmaAldrich (USA), and the images were acquired with an Olympus BX61 microscope
(USA).

Culture of Neuro2a (mouse neuroblastoma)
Neuro2a cells were cultured according to the recommended protocol from
ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, USA). Briefly, cells were cultured in a
75 cm2 culture bottle with 15 mL of culture medium composed of high glucose
DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, GibcoBRL, USA), 1 % penicillin /
streptomycin (GibcoBRL), 1 % glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 % fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Cultilab, Brazil). Cells were kept in an incubator at 37° C and
5 % CO2. Upon reaching 60 % confluence cells were trypsinized and subcultured
in the ratio of 1:5.

Immunostaining

The control brains or decellularized brains were immunolabeled with antilaminin antibody (Merck Millipore, USA), followed by incubation with fluorophoreconjugated secondary antibody (Alexa 488 or 594; Molecular Probes, USA) plus
DAPI. Coverslips were assembled with Fluoromount G (Electron Microscopy
Sciences) and then analyzed using an inverted confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Germany). Image overlays were generated using ImageJ software
(NIH, USA).
Neuro2a cells were injected on decellularized brains and kept in an
incubator at 37°C and 5 % CO2. After this period, cells were fixed with 4 %
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), and
immunollabeled with anti-beta III tubulin (Tubbeta3) (Merck Millipore) followed by
incubation with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa 488 or 594)
plus DAPI. Coverslips were assembled with Fluoromount G (2: 1 in PBS) and
then analyzed by an inverted confocal microscope. Image overlays were
generated using ImageJ software.

Repopulation of decellularized brain with Neuro2a cells
Repopulation of decellularized brain was performed after sterilization of
the tissue with peracetic acid (PAA) 1:1000 in 20 % ethanol, placed on 24-well
culture plate. After washing the samples 6 times with high glucose DMEM, 1 x 106
Neuro2a cells were injected into the decellularized brain, and culture medium was
added, until the incubation time periods were reached (24 and 72 h). After these
periods of time, the repopulated decellularized brain was analyzed.

Scanning electron microscopy

Samples of repopulated and non-repopulated decellularized brain fixed in
2.5 % glutaraldehyde solution buffered in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate solution,
pH 7.2. After the fixation process, samples were washed with 0.1 M sodium
cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2 and submitted to metallic impregnation. To make this,
samples were incubated in 2 % osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate
buffer, pH 7.2 for 2 h, washed with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.2 three
times during 15 min, and incubated in 1 % tannic acid water solution for 45 min,
followed by two washes in distilled water (10 min each). After metallic
impregnation, samples were dehydrated gradually in 50-70-90 % ethanol (twice,
30 min each) and 100 % (three times, 30 min each) and then, samples were
submitted to a drying process in a critical point chamber (Balzers CPD 030,
Lichtenstein) using CO2. Samples were then coated with a thin layer of 20-30 nm
thickness of gold (Sputtering, Leica Microsystems, Germany) and scanned on a
FEI Quanta 250 FEG scanning electron microscope (ThermoFisher, USA).

Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS version 23.0, USA). The results were expressed by average ± SEM, and
significance was tested by t-test or one-way ANOVA, as appropriate. The value
of p < 0.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS

Murine brains were fully decellularized by SDS

After fast freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by 24 h in 1 % SDS, the mice
brains were analyzed to investigate the remaining of cells, nucleic acids and
proteins. Figure 1A presents a representative image showing that decellularized
the brain became smaller, with less blood after the decellularization procedure.
Further direct confocal microscopy analysis on a decellularized mouse brain
section revealed the absence of nuclei stained with DAPI (Figure 1D), as
compared to the clear presence of DAPI-stained nuclei in fresh nondecellularized mouse brain (Figure 1B). The absence of nuclei was confirmed by
H&E staining (Figure 1C and E). Therefore, the fully decellularized murine brains
were then named decellularized brain matrix (DBM).

Decellularization reduces the amount of nucleic acids leaving a higher
protein concentration per weight of DBM
The quantification of DNA, RNA, and protein was performed in order to
evaluate the effectiveness of decellularization. DNA, RNA, and protein
concentrations were normalized by brain weight. The amount of DNA (Figure 1F)
and RNA (Figure 1G) decreased after the decellularization process, whereas the
the total protein concentrations was statistically higher after decelularization
(Figure 1H, *p = 0.0155).

DBM maintains essential ECM proteins after decellularization
Alcian Blue stains acidic polysaccharides such as glycosaminoglycans
(Figures 2A and B). Masson’s Trichrom staining of collagen IV shows that its
architecture was not affected by decellularization protocol (Figures 2C and D).
Periodic Acid–Schiff (PAS) is a staining method used to detect polysaccharides
such as glycogen, and glycoproteins, glycolipids and mucins in tissues. PAS
staining showed that although the decellularization process was performed with
a detergent (SDS), the basal lamina remained preserved (Figures 2E and F).

DBM maintain collagen and laminin after decellularization
The immunofluorescence performed in non-decellularized brains and in
DBM identified the presence of laminin, a protein crucial for the repopulation
process. The results showed the presence of laminin (Figures 3A and 3B).
Picrosirius red staining was performed to observe the presence of collagen type
I, II and III (Figures 3C and 3D). Under polarized light, collagen bundles appear
green, red, or yellow, and are easily differentiated from the black background

33.

These two assays showed that laminin and collagen type I, II, and III were also
preserved after the decellularization process.

SEM microscopy shows the architecture of the DBM repopulated with
Neuro2a cells
We also aimed to analyze if Neuro2a cells adhered when grown on DBM
as they would do while cultured on plastic or glass. SEM analysis of slices of the
internal region of DBM showed the presence of fibers of different lengths and
thicknesses (Figure 4A) and holes that appear to be ripped cell nuclei (Figure 4B)
from inner sections. In slices of the internal region of the DBM we could also
observe the preservation of grooves (Figure 4E) while in the visualization of the
external region of the DBM we could notice the presence of a vessel (Figure 4F).
After recellularization for 24 h we observed that cell spreading and extended

cellular protrusions were rare (Figure 4C and D), suggesting that there was no
evidence of neuronal differentiation of Neuro2a cells, indicating that during this
period of incubation the scaffold did not induce neuronal differentiation.

DBM maintained cells in an undifferentiated state
After injecting suspensions of Neuro2a cells into the DBM, they were
incubated at 37oC and 5 % CO2 for 24 and 72 h. After fixing and performing the
histological sections of the DBM, it was possible to find Neuro2a cells by
immunostaining (Figure 5A and F), showing that the scaffold was able to maintain
the cells alive and undifferentiated. There was no evidence of neuronal

DISCUSSION
In the present work, we investigated the use of ECM scaffolds from murine
brains (DBM) as a platform for repopulation of decellularized tissue. Our results
showed a fast and straightforward method based on freezing and thawing murine
brains followed by soaking them in a 1 % SDS solution for complete
decellularization. This concentration was able to decellularize the brains with
minimal residues of DNA reminiscent and preserving structures as the basement
membrane, collagen IV, as well as adhesive proteins such as laminin. For the
first time it was shown that a simple and rapid process involving just one chemical
reagent could successfully decellularize murine brains.

The ECM has a crucial role in the development and repair of tissues. It
offers support to cellular organization, and participates of cell growth and
proliferation by the interaction with growth factors and cytokines (34-37). Therefore,
the preservation of the ECM after the decellularization process showed here is
very important to help cell reorganization after repopulation. In this work, after
establishing a novel simple method for complete murine brain decellularization,
and preservation of ECM structures, we also showed that the remaining scaffold
(DBM) is biocompatible, being capable of maintaining Neuro2a cells alive for
72 h.

CONCLUSION
Decellularized scaffolds derived from an organ can be used as a platform
to understand decellularization and cell repopulation. Although further studies are
still required to validate the present data in translational models, our results are
promising due to the fact that we could fully decellularize murine brains with a
fast (24 h for complete decellularization) and simple (only one detergent and 3
freezing and thawing processes) method. The decellularization process also
retained essential ECM proteins that are crucial for cell adhesion, migration,
proliferation and consequently repopulation of the tissue. Lastly, the
decellularized brain scaffold showed to be biocompatible, as neural cells were
injected inside their structure and could be identified by immunohistochemistry.
