ABSTRACT

27

Climate change scenarios predict an increase in mean air temperatures and in the frequency, intensity,

28

and length of extreme temperature events in many wine-growing regions worldwide. Because elevated

29

temperature has detrimental effects on the berry growth and composition, it threatens the economic

30

and environmental sustainability of wine production. Using Cabernet Sauvignon fruit-bearing cuttings,

31

we investigated the effects of high temperature (HT) on grapevine berries through a label-free shotgun

32

proteomic analysis coupled to a complementary metabolomic study. Among the 2279 proteins

33

identified, 592 differentially abundant proteins were found in berries exposed to HT. The gene

34

ontology categories “Stress”, “Protein”, “Secondary metabolism” and “Cell wall” were predominantly

35

altered under HT. High temperatures strongly impaired carbohydrate and energy metabolism, and the

36

effects depended on the stage of development and duration of treatment. Transcript amounts correlated

37

poorly with protein expression levels in HT berries, highlighting the value of proteomic studies in the

38

context of heat stress. Furthermore, this work reveals that HT alters key proteins driving berry

39

development and ripening. Finally, we provide a list of differentially abundant proteins that can be

40

considered as potential markers for developing or selecting grape varieties that are better adapted to

41

warmer climates or extreme heat waves.

INTRODUCTION

49

Grapevine is economically the most important fruit crop in the world, providing dried fruits, table

50

grapes and the basis for wine making (www.oiv.int; www.fao.org). The combination of climate, soil

51

and viticultural practices in a given region constitutes a highly interactive system known as “terroir”

52

(Deloire et al. 2005). The interaction between “terroir” and the plant’s genotype (cultivar) significantly

53

affects vine development and berry composition, and thereafter determines wine quality and character

54

(Van Leeuwen and Seguin 2006). Grapevine requires suitable temperatures, radiation intensities and

55

duration, and water availability during the growth cycle for optimal fruit production and quality (Kuhn

56

et al. 2014). Because of on-going climate change, the environmental parameters in most wine

57

producing regions around the world are expected to change, potentially lowering productivity and

58

altering the traditional characteristics (“typicity”) of the wine from a given region (Schultz and Jones

59

2010). While some of these climatic constraints can be overcome, at least partially, by viticultural

60

practices, temperature remains more difficult to control under field conditions (Van Leeuwen et al.

61

2013). Climate change scenarios predict an increase in global mean temperatures between 1.5 and

62

5°C, during the 21th century (IPCC, 2014), in addition to an increase in the frequency, intensity, and

63

duration of extreme temperature events (Lobell et al. 2008). Considering that air temperature is a key

64

climate variable affecting grapevine phenology, berry metabolism and composition (Jones et al. 2005;

65

Martínez-Lüscher et al. 2016), global warming represents a serious threat for wine production and/or

66

typicity in many wine-growing regions worldwide (Fraga et al. 2016).

67

Temperatures above the optimum are sensed as heat stress by living organisms. Heat stress disturbs

68

cellular homeostasis and can lead to severe retardation in growth and development and even death

69

(Wahid et al. 2007). In grapevine, warming promotes vegetative growth and disturbs the plant’s

70

carbon balance (Greer and Weedon 2012), adversely affecting flower set and young berry

71

development (Greer and Weston 2010). HS also impacts fruit primary and secondary metabolism,

72

desynchronizing sugar and organic acid metabolism and delaying sugar and polyphenol accumulation

73

during ripening (Torregrosa et al. 2017; Gouot et al. 2018). As a consequence, heat waves occurring

74

during key berry development stages can dramatically affect the organoleptic properties of wine even

75

when more favourable weather conditions prevail for the remaining of the season.

76

In this context, the common viticultural practice of removing leaves around the fruit zone to

77

enhance aroma development and avoid fungal infections (Alem et al. 2018), might be questioned since

78

it affects light exposure and temperature of the berries. Because of the direct irradiative effects,

79

temperature within the fruit may differ very significantly from that of the whole plant or surrounding

80

air (Cola et al., 2009). The microclimate (mostly temperature and light conditions) strongly influences

81

the metabolite composition of berries, affecting flavonols, anthocyanins, amino acids and aroma

82

precursors (Downey et al. 2006; Pereira et al. 2006; Asproudi et al. 2016; Young et al. 2016; Reshef et

83

al. 2017). These effects can be explained, at least in part, by the substantial remodelling of the fruit

84

transcriptome observed under these conditions (du Plessis et al. 2017; Lecourieux et al. 2017).

85

In a previous report, we showed dramatic biochemical and transcriptomic changes in heat-exposed

86

berries, depending on both the developmental stage and the stress duration (Lecourieux et al. 2017).

87

Although transcriptomic analyses have offered comprehensive insights into the mechanisms

88

underlying the HS responses in grape (Liu et al. 2012; Carbonell-Bejerano et al. 2013; Rienth et al.

89

2014b; Jiang et al. 2017; Lecourieux et al. 2017), it is recognised that changes in transcript abundance

90

do not always correlate with the levels of the encoded proteins (Keller and Simm 2018). Furthermore,

91

proteins represent a more functional level of gene expression than transcripts because they have a

92

direct impact on metabolism and other cellular processes. Therefore, state of the art mass spectrometry

93

analysis of the proteome is a powerful tool to study molecular mechanisms and biological traits in

94

plants, including responses to abiotic stresses (Kosova et al. 2018). Using shotgun proteomic tools

95

such as iTRAQ (isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) and label-free quantification

96

techniques, several proteomic studies have recently investigated the heat responses of grapevine leaves

97

(Liu et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2017) or grape cell cultures (George et al. 2015).

98

To better understand the consequences of high temperature (HT), inherent to leaf removal, on berry

99

development and to improve our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms involved in grapevine

100

fruit response to HT, the present work combines transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolite analysis

101

using Cabernet Sauvignon fruit-bearing cuttings. A label-free proteomic approach was used to

102

investigate changes in the grape berry proteome resulting from direct exposure to elevated

103

temperature. The collected proteomic data were compared with our previous transcriptomic analysis

104

performed on the same berry samples (Lecourieux et al., 2017). These data showed a strong and

105

negative effect of HT on proteins related to carbohydrate and energy metabolism, which led us to

106

analyse the impact of HT on primary metabolites using tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

107

Finally, we focused on proteins accumulating in berries exposed to HT that are potentially involved in

108

thermotolerance. Altogether, this work helps to better understand the consequences of heat stress on

109

developing grape berries and provides a list of potential heat-tolerance molecular markers that could

110

be useful for breeders and viticulturists.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

113
114

Quantitative analysis of heat stress responsive proteins in grape berries

115

Experiments were performed on fruit-bearing cuttings of V. vinifera Cabernet Sauvignon as described

116

in Lecourieux et al. (2017). In brief, berries at three different stages of development were exposed to

117

elevated temperatures for 12 h (7:00 am to 7:00 pm) during each day of treatment and harvested for

118

analysis after 1 and 7 days of treatment. The average pulp temperature of the heat-treated berries was

119

about 8°C higher than in control berries. A label-free proteomic approach was performed to identify

120

proteins with differential abundance between control and heat-treated berry samples.

121

Using the parameters and filters described in the Material and Methods, the conducted label-free

122

experiment led to the identification of 3972 protein groups (from here on referred to as proteins) in the

123

combined dataset from the six conditions (three stages x two treatment durations), of which 2279

124

showed two or more unique peptides (Table 1). Protein abundance changes between control and heat-

125

exposed fruits were considered to be significant when a minimum fold change of 1.5 (log2FC > 0.58 or

126

< -0.58) was reached, with a significance threshold of p < 0.05. Only proteins identified in all three

127

biological replicates were considered for quantification. Among the quantified proteins with a

128

minimum of two unique peptides, 592 DAPs (differentially abundant proteins) displayed significant

129

differences in abundance between control and HT berries in at least one of the six conditions. The

130

entire dataset is available via ProteomeXchange (identifier PXD014693) and in Supplementary Table

131

S1. Further information on the 592 DAPs is provided in Supplementary Table S2. Among these 592

132

DAPs, 501 proteins were identified in only one condition (139 up-regulated and 362 down-regulated)

133

while the 91 remaining proteins were retrieved in more than one condition (16 up-regulated, 61 down-

134

regulated, and 14 proteins that were up-regulated in some conditions but down-regulated in others)

135

(Table 1 and Table S2). More DAPs were identified at the ripening stage (304 DAPs) than at the

136

green (146 DAPs) or veraison stages (222 DAPs). Whereas the numbers of up- and down-regulated

137

proteins were similar at veraison (115 up, 107 down), more down-regulated proteins were found when

138

the HT was applied at the green stage (24 up, 122 down) or ripening (49 up, 255 down) stages (Figure

139

1A). The DAPs identified after short (1 day) treatments were mostly different from those observed

140

after long (7 days) treatments. Indeed, only 1 (up), 9 (4 up, 5 down) and 18 (2 up, 16 down) common

141

DAPs between 1D or 7D of HT were observed at the green, veraison and middle ripening stages,

142

respectively (Figure 1B and Tables S2, S3, S4 & S5). Similarly, at all three stages, only one common

143

down-regulated DAP was identified after 1 day of HT (VIT_12s0057g01020, fasciclin-like protein),

144

with none being detected after 7 days of treatment (Table S2). The number of common DAPs per

145

stage increased when looking for proteins with modified abundance after 1 and/or 7 days treatment. In

146

this case, 7 DAPs (3 up, 4 down) were found in common for the three stages, and up to 31 DAPs were

147

obtained when comparing heat effects between green and veraison stages (Figure 1C and

148

Supplementary Table 2).

149

To determine the functional categories affected by HT, the identified DAPs were functionally

150

classified using MapMan BIN codes (Usadel et al. 2005) and a V. vinifera mapping file (Lecourieux et

151

al., 2017). The predominant proteins changed in berries in response to HT were assigned to “protein

152

metabolism” (114/592 DAPs, 19.3%), “stress” (54/592 DAPs, 9.1%), “secondary metabolism”

153

(31/592 DAPs, 5.2%) and “cell wall” (25/592 DAPs, 4.2%) (Figure 2). Except for the categories

154

“stress” (36 up, 18 down) and “RNA” (10 up, 9 down), all the others categories contained more down-

155

regulated proteins that up-regulated ones, with particularly asymmetrical changes in some categories,

156

such as “lipid metabolism” (0 up, 16 down) and “transport” (2 up, 17 down). No particular effect of

157

HT according to the developmental stage was observed on these functional categories, whereas

158

categories linked to carbohydrate and energy metabolism (glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,

5

159

fermentation, gluconeogenesis, minor and major carbohydrate (CHO) metabolism) or related to

160

“photosynthesis”, “cell wall” and “redox” were mostly impacted during veraison and/or ripening

161

stages (Supplementary Table 2).

162
163

Poor correlation between the transcriptome and proteome in heat-stressed berries

164

Global analyses based on gene expression and protein profiles provide a powerful tool for

165

understanding how organisms respond to environment changes. To integrate proteomic data with

166

transcriptomic results, the present protein abundance data were compared to each corresponding

167

differentially expressed gene (DEG) identified in the same grape berry samples exposed to HT

168

(Lecourieux et al., 2017). Whereas 592 DAPs were retrieved in at least one of the six HT conditions

169

(Table 1, Supplementary Table S1), 6848 DEGs were identified using the same berry samples

170

(Lecourieux et al. 2017). A linear correlation between differentially expressed transcripts and the

171

corresponding proteins was established for 64 out of 592 DAPs (Figure 4, Supplementary Table

172

S11). Two types of correlation profiles were found. The first one corresponds to proteins and

173

transcripts that exhibit profiles with the same tendency (up- or down-regulation in response to HT) and

174

the second one includes proteins and transcripts that are inversely correlated for a same gene. The best

175

relationship between mRNA and protein levels (39 DAPs) was observed when HT was applied for one

176

day at veraison, and for proteins belonging to functional BINs associated to “heat stress” (25

177

members), “hormone” (4), and “secondary metabolism” (5) (Figure 4, Supplementary Table S11).

178

Our results underline the poor correlation between the proteome and the transcriptome in HT

179

berries, with only 11% (64/592 DAPs) of the differentially abundant proteins that were also impacted

180

at the mRNA expression level. This is not unexpected since HT leads to denaturation and aggregation

181

of proteins, and because translation, especially under elevated temperature, is governed by a variety of

182

regulatory mechanisms independent of transcription rate (Bokszczanin and Fragkostefanakis 2013).

183

These include the impacts of miRNAs on mRNA stability and translatability, mRNA half-life, global

184

and transcript specific translational rates, as well as protein turnover. Any lag between the synthesis of

185

a gene transcript and its translation into a protein could also give rise to an apparent discrepancy

186

between transcript and protein abundance at a given sampling time (Keller and Simm 2018). Last but

187

not least, the poor correlation between transcript and protein levels in heat-treated berry samples may

188

also be due to alternative splicing (AS) events. Increasing evidence has shown that AS is a critical

189

post-transcriptional event and plays an important role in plant stress responses (Baurle 2016).

190

Particularly, many genes are under transcriptional regulation by the circadian clock, and several

191

circadian clock genes show AS in response to even small changes in temperature (James et al. 2018).

192

In grapevine, AS changes were observed for nearly 70% of the genes in leaves exposed to

193

temperatures above 35°C. In the same study, only 64 out of the 808 identified DAPs were retrieved as

194

differentially expressed at the transcript level (Jiang et al. 2017), that fits well with the weak

195

transcript/protein correlation observed in our work. Jiang et al. (2017) suggested that AS changes

196

under high temperature could provide molecular plasticity allowing the plants to adapt to stress

197

conditions. Using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants exposed or not to a non-lethal HT,

198

referred to as priming, Ling et al. (2018) have recently demonstrated that AS functions as a novel

199

component of heat-shock memory.

200

Despite the generally poor correlation between individual transcripts and proteins levels in berries

201

exposed to HT, there was a much better correspondence at the functional category level, with

202

transcripts and proteins assigned to the “stress”, “protein metabolism” and “secondary metabolism”

203

MapMan BINs showing consistent responses as a group (Supplementary Figure S1). We also

204

noticed that, at the transcript level, most of the functional categories were differentially affected

205

according to the developmental stage and the stress duration whereas it was less obvious at the protein

206

level. The best relationship between transcripts and proteins levels was observed with genes related to

207

the category “stress”, and especially to the “heat” sub-category. Among the 30 HSPs whose protein

208

abundance increased in response to HT, 25 were also up-regulated at the transcript level

209

(Supplementary Table S12). Most proteins are inherently thermo-labile, with some becoming

210

denatured at the temperatures that grapevines experience during a heat wave. In addition, high

211

temperature is often associated with oxidative stress leading to production of reactive oxygen species

212

that irreversibly damage proteins. Maintaining proteins in stable and functional conformations and

213

preventing their aggregation are essential for survival of cells under high temperature. HSPs function

214

as molecular chaperones in maintaining protein quality and folding, and are required for the

215

acquisition of plant thermotolerance (Bokszczanin and Fragkostefanakis 2013). It is well established

216

that transcription factors from the HSF family regulate the heat stress response in plants, through a

217

massive up-regulation of HSP genes (Scharf et al. 2012). However, as transcription factors are low

218

abundance proteins they largely escaped proteomic detection, and no HSF was retrieved in the present

219

study despite the observed transcriptional up-regulation of six VviHSF genes in heat-exposed berries

220

(Lecourieux et al. 2017).

221

In good agreement with our transcriptomic data, the protein abundance of the functional category

222

“Protein metabolism” was strongly impacted with nearly 20% of the identified DAPs that belong to

223

this category being affected, especially those belonging to the sub-categories “protein synthesis” (34

224

DAPs) and “protein degradation” (55 DAPs) (Supplementary Table S6). However, the HT triggered

225

a strong down-accumulation effect on the “protein metabolism” category (92 out of the 114 DAPs), in

226

contrast with what was observed on transcripts (333 up- and 307 down-regulated genes). A number of

227

studies demonstrated that different abiotic stresses, including heat, result in a general inhibition of

228

protein translation (Yanguez et al. 2013). Accordingly, we observed a significant decrease in

229

abundance of many proteins related to protein synthesis including various ribosome structural proteins

230

and several translation initiation factors (Supplementary Table S6). Whereas inhibiting translation

231

under stress helps to reduce energy consumption, certain specific mRNAs are selectively translated to

232

produce relevant proteins involved in the proper establishment of the stress adaptation process. By

233

studying the translatome of Arabidopsis seedling exposed to HT, Yanguez et al. (2013) observed that

234

regulation of gene expression at the translational level is superimposed on regulation at the

235

transcriptional level, and often reinforces the response of individual genes/proteins to heat stress.

236

Protein translation is accomplished by the combined actions of the ribosomes and ancillary proteins

237

such as initiation, elongation, and termination factors. Yanguez et al. (2013) showed that translation

238

could be regulated at the initiation phase in Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to HT, even if the

239

mechanisms involved in this regulation remain unclear. To date, there is some evidence for the role of

240

different plant translation initiation factors (eIFs) in various abiotic stresses responses (Dutt et al.

241

2015). Our proteomic data highlighted the increase in abundance of four eIFs upon HS, namely eIF1A

242

(VIT_15s0046g01500), two isoforms of eIF3 (VIT_14s0060g01630, VIT_00s0880g00020) and eIF5

243

(VIT_14s0006g01990), whereas others eIF isoforms were decreased (Supplementary Table S6).

244

eIF5 (VIT_14s0006g01990) showed the highest accumulation score (Log2FC 5.22) within this

245

functional category. The importance of eIF5 proteins in thermotolerance was highlighted in pea

246

(Suragani et al. 2011) and Arabidopsis (Xu et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2017).

250

Heat stress impacts the secondary metabolism in developing berry

251

The strong effects of HT observed on transcripts assigned to the “secondary metabolism” functional

252

category (291 DEGs across the six conditions, (Lecourieux et al. 2017)) were confirmed at the protein

253

level (31 out of the 592 DAPs), albeit to a lesser extent (Supplementary Table S8). These 31 DAPs

254

(11 up, 20 down) mainly belonged to the subcategories: “isoprenoids” (7 DAPs), “phenylpropanoid-

255

lignin” (12) and “flavonoids” (7).

256

HT altered expression of numerous genes related to aromatic potential, including genes encoding

257

biosynthetic enzymes for terpenes and methoxypyrazines (Lecourieux et al. 2017), but the proteomic

258

data from the current study suggested that these changes in transcript abundance were not translated

259

through to the protein level. A few proteins related to isoprenoid subfamily were down-accumulated

260

under HT including a 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS10, VIT_04s0008g02250), which is involved in

261

the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids that are incorporated into plant lipids (precursors of

262

cuticular waxes), and several enzymes related to the synthesis of precursors of terpenoids

263

(Supplementary

264

VIT_13s0064g00810) was found more abundant in stressed berries at veraison. Expression of various

265

VvCCD genes was reported to increase towards berry ripening and enzymes in this family were

266

demonstrated to promote desirable flavor and aroma compounds in grapes and wine (Mathieu et al.

267

2005; Rienth et al. 2014a; Alem et al. 2018). The putative role of CCD proteins in heat responses is

268

still unknown but these proteins were suggested to enhance tolerance to various abiotic stresses

269

through their enzymatic products (e.g. apocarotenoids) acting as stress signals (Havaux 2014). For

280

significant increase in lignin biosynthesis would confer additional strength to lignified secondary cell

292

proteins were less abundant in heated berries, suggesting a sharp decline of the corresponding

293

enzymatic activities (Supplementary Tables S2 & S8). This lower amount of key enzymes probably

294

contributes to the reduction of flavonoid synthesis in grape berries exposed to heat. However, other

295

concomitant processes may explain the decrease of flavonoid contents in warmed berries, including

296

reduced biosynthetic enzyme activities due to non-optimal temperature, enzymatic oxidation or

297

chemical degradation after ROS scavenging (Gouot et al. 2018). Upon their biosynthesis in the

298

cytosol, flavonoids are rapidly accumulated into vacuoles or other cellular compartments through

299

vesicle trafficking, membrane transporters or glutathione S-transferase (GST)-mediated transport

300

(Zhao 2015). In addition to transport of flavonoids into vacuoles mediated by ATP-binding cassette

301

(ABC) transporters (Francisco et al. 2013), there is also H+-dependent transport mechanism in

302

grapevine (Gomez et al. 2011; Kuang et al. 2019). Vacuolar transport of anthocyanins and other

Harmful effects of heat stress on carbohydrate and energy berry metabolism

314

A drastic negative effect of HT was observed for proteins assigned to primary carbohydrate

315

metabolism (Supplementary Table S9). Almost all the DAPs related to the following processes were

316

under-accumulated after HT: major CHO metabolism (6 out of 8 DAPs), glycolysis (8 out of 9

317

DAPs), fermentation (4 out of 5 DAPs), gluconeogenesis (3 out of 4 DAPs), oxidative pentose

318

phosphate pathway (6 DAPs) and TCA cycle (13 out of 14 DAPs). To better understand the

319

consequences of this HT repressive effect, and to expand beyond the previously reported metabolite

320

changes (Lecourieux et al., 2017), we measured an additional 31 metabolites that are involved in sugar

321

or organic acid metabolism, or respiration. To put the measured metabolites into a metabolic context, a

322

schematic representation of plant central carbon metabolism was created to display the metabolite

323

profiles under HT compared to control conditions, for each developmental stage and each stress

324

duration (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S10). A significant effect of the developmental stage (two-

325

way ANOVA, p < 0.05) was observed for most quantified metabolites (23 out of 31), in agreement

326

with the previously reported metabolite profiles in developing berries from Cabernet Sauvignon fruit-

327

bearing cuttings (Dai et al. 2013). HT significantly influenced the content of 14 metabolites including

328

shikimate, glycerate, glycerol-3-P (G-3-P), several glycolytic intermediates (fructose 6-phosphate

329

(Fru6P), 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) and pyruvate), fumarate, and several sugar phosphates (glucose

330

6-P (G6P), trehalose 6-P (T6P), sucrose 6´-P (S6P) and mannose 6-P (M6P)). The well-known

331

accelerated decrease of malate under elevated temperature was also observed although the changes

332

were below the level of significance in an ANOVA test. However, when considered over the 14-day

333

time frame of the experiments, the decrease in malate was statistically significant according to a t-test

334

(Figure 3). This agrees with the significantly lower malate content detected previously in HT berries

335

at harvest (Lecourieux et al., 2017).

336

Metabolism undergoes profound reprogramming during fleshy fruit development (Beauvoit et al.

337

2018). The contents of primary and secondary metabolites have been investigated in developing grape

338

berries (Dai et al. 2013; Degu et al. 2014; Cuadros-Inostroza et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2017). Using

339

Cabernet Sauvignon fruit-bearing cuttings as in the present work, Dai et al. (2013) conducted a deep

340

analysis of metabolites from central carbon metabolism using an LC-MS/MS approach. They reported

341

the timing of important switches in primary carbohydrate metabolism during grape berry development

342

and discussed the relationship between these metabolite changes and transcriptional and translational

343

modifications within the fruit. Similarly, Wang et al. (2017) reported close correlations between the

345

vinifera Early Campbell fruits. Down-regulation of carbohydrate production and protein synthesis is a

346

conserved response of plants to abiotic stresses (Cramer et al. 2011). This may be a way for plants to

347

save energy, and reflects a shift from plant growth to mechanisms of protection. However, with the

348

exception of organic acids, the effects of high temperature on berry primary metabolism in general are

349

still poorly described (Serrano et al. 2017). It is well known that warm climatic conditions enhance the

350

degradation of malate in grapevine fruits, leading to a decrease in total acidity (Sweetman et al. 2014).

351

Sugar metabolism is desynchronized from organic acid metabolism in ripening berries at high

352

temperatures (Rienth et al. 2016). The micro-environment plays an active role in controlling the

353

dynamics of primary metabolite accumulation that affect fruit composition. For instance, heating

354

strongly alters the berry concentration of various amino acids, including phenylalanine and γ-

355

aminobutyric acid, and decreases malate content (Lecourieux et al. 2017). Integrating microclimatic

356

parameters and metabolomic analysis, Reshef et al. (2017) reported that solar irradiance affected the

357

overall levels and patterns of accumulation of sugars, organic acids, amino acids and

358

phenylpropanoids, across the grape cluster. The relationship between the diurnal microclimatic

359

changes (radiation and temperature) and the berry metabolic dynamics was recently described (Reshef

360

et al. 2019). The present study provides additional evidence about the harmful effects of heat on berry

361

primary metabolism through the quantification of 31 metabolite intermediates related to sugar

362

accumulation, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle, as well as through the identification of numerous

363

proteins related to the corresponding metabolic pathways whose abundance is affected by HS. Among

364

the 31 metabolites quantified, 14 were significantly impacted upon HT, with reduced contents in

365

warmed berries for all of these (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S10). Some intermediates were

366

more affected when the HT was applied during the green stage (glycerate, fumarate), and others

367

during ripening (T6P and S6P), whereas the remaining ones were negatively impacted at all three

368

developmental stages (pyruvate, shikimate, G3P, 3-PGA, G6P, Man6P, F6P). Reduced malate

369

contents were also observed under HS, including the green stage (Figure 3). These primary metabolite

370

profiles coincide with a dramatic down-regulation of numerous enzymes related to carbohydrate and

371

energy metabolism in heat-treated berries (48 out of 56 DAPs, Supplementary Table S9), and more

372

than 70% of these DAPs were repressed during the ripening period. Using a Cabernet Sauvignon cell

373

suspension culture subjected to HS (42°C), George et al. (2015) observed a similar decline in proteins

374

related to sugar metabolism. Our results highlighted changes in many metabolic pathways in grape

375

berries exposed to heat, possibly due to the inhibitory effect of elevated temperature on metabolic

376

enzyme activities from these pathways.

377

Several enzymes from the pathways of sugar and sugar-phosphate metabolism were less abundant

378

in heated berries, including a fructokinase (FRK, VIT_14s0006g01410) and two hexokinases (HXK,

379

VIT_18s0001g14230, VIT_11s0016g03070). The decrease in these enzymes may contribute to the

380

lower concentration in sugar phosphates (T6P, S6P, G6P and F6P) under heat, since the hexoses

11

381

(glucose and fructose) resulting from cleavage of imported sucrose can be converted to hexose

382

phosphates by FRK and HXK in the cytosol (Stein and Granot 2018). In plants, trehalose 6-phosphate

383

(T6P) acts as a signal of sucrose availability connecting plant growth and development to its metabolic

384

status, and it was reported that T6P levels can exhibit dynamic responses to environmental cues

385

(Figueroa and Lunn 2016). An increase in T6P content was observed in berries from veraison on, but

386

this increase was lower under heat (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S10). In some plants, T6P

387

inhibits the SnRK1 Ser/Thr protein kinase, in turn contributing to a reduction in anthocyanin content

388

(Baena-Gonzalez et al. 2007). It is thus tempting to speculate that the increase in T6P concentration

389

from veraison onwards contributes to anthocyanin accumulation through repression of SnRK1, and

390

that this regulatory process is less effective under heat. However, the roles of T6P as a signalling

391

molecule and the SnRK1/T6P pathway during the berry ripening process and in HT response remain

392

to be demonstrated. In sink organs such as developing berries, sucrose cleavage is carried out either by

393

invertase (INV) to yield glucose and fructose, or by sucrose synthase (SUS) to yield UDPG and

394

fructose. Our proteomic analysis revealed a strong accumulation of a SUS isoform after HT at

395

veraison (SUS2, VIT_05s0077g01930). However, glucose, fructose and sucrose contents were not

396

differentially altered by heat treatment (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S10), whereas a delay in the

397

increase in total soluble solids (TSS) content was observed in developing berries after heat exposure

398

during the green stage (Lecourieux et al. 2017). Accumulation of SUS may be a sign of hypoxia

399

resulting from increased respiration rate under high temperature conditions, thus consuming oxygen

400

faster than it can diffuse into the bulky grape berry tissue.

401

Arabidopsis, SUS genes are described as hypoxic responsive genes and a role for sucrose synthase as

402

part of the acclimation mechanism to anoxia in dicots was proposed (Santaniello et al., 2014).

Such as AtSUS1 and AtSUS4 in

403

The present study also revealed the lower abundance of many glycolytic enzymes (9 DAPs) in

404

warmed berries, mostly during ripening, together with the reduced content of some glycolytic

405

intermediates (Fru6P, 3-PGA, pyruvate). A similar decrease in abundance of glycolytic enzymes or

406

glycolytic intermediates was also reported for some grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon,

407

when berries ripen under normal growth conditions (Giribaldi et al. 2007; Dai et al. 2013; Martinez-

408

Esteso et al. 2013). Thus, the consequence of heat stress on the glycolytic pathway remains unclear

409

since the glycolytic flux might have been maintained of even increased at high temperature although

410

the decrease of some glycolytic-related DAPs. Disturbing the glycolytic pathway may impair the

411

generation of energy (ATP), reducing equivalents (NADH) and various intermediates required for the

412

production of amino acid, lipids and secondary metabolites. For example, it has been reported that cell

413

energy, reducing power and α-ketoglutarate availability are potential drivers for flavonoid

414

biosynthesis in grape cells (Soubeyrand et al. 2018).

415

The TCA cycle is a central metabolic hub since it generates energy, reducing power and carbon

416

skeletons. Several enzymes from the TCA cycle were repressed in heated berries but consequences on

417

the corresponding TCA intermediates were not obvious within the time frame of the analysis. The

418

transcript levels of MDH, which catalyzes a reversible reaction between oxaloacetate and malate, and

419

ME which oxidizes malate to pyruvate, were reported to increase during grape berry ripening. This

420

higher expression might contribute to the decline of malate concentration after veraison (Martinez-

421

Esteso et al., 2011; Wang et al, 2017). In our study, however, heat exposure reduced protein amount of

422

both

423

VIT_00s0373g00040; ME: VIT_15s0046g03670, VIT_11s0016g03210), therefore questioning their

424

precise role in hastening the malate decrease under heat. The amount of a phosphoenolpyruvate

425

carboxylase (PEPC, VIT_19s0014g01390) was also reduced by HT at the green stage. This may

426

contribute to lower the amount of malate under heat before veraison (Figure 3), since the first step of

427

anaplerotic malate synthesis involves the carboxylation of PEP by PEPC (Sweetman et al. 2009).

428

However, the loss of malate during ripening has been attributed to increased degradation rather than

429

decreased synthesis pre-veraison (Ruffner et al. 1976; Sweetman et al. 2014). Accordingly, PEPC

430

activity decreases in pre-veraison berries with day heating, and malate content did not correlate with

431

changes in PEPC activity (Sweetman et al. 2014). The PEPC activity is highly regulated by reversible

432

protein phosphorylation and mono-ubiquitination, which affects its sensitivity to feedback inhibition

433

by malate (Ruiz-Ballesta et al. 2016). Thus, changes in the phosphorylation and/or the ubiquitination

434

status of PEPC might be more important than changes in total PEPC protein abundance. Energy-

435

consuming processes such as gluconeogenesis may also be impacted in ripening berries exposed to

436

HT, with three down-regulated enzymes (MDH, PEPCK and isocitrate lyase). Lower MDH amounts

437

would reduce the accumulation of oxaloacetate (OAA), required for PEP formation through

438

phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity (PEPCK). In normal growth conditions, both PEPCK

439

activity and transcript abundance are increased in berries after veraison (Walker et al. 2015). In

440

ripening grapes, PEPCK may function in gluconeogenesis when malate released from the vacuole

441

exceeds the demand from other malate-consuming processes (Walker et al. 2015).

Heat stress promotes changes in lipid metabolism and cell wall remodelling

444

The functional category “Lipid metabolism” was particularly affected in heat-exposed berries since all

445

the lipid-related proteins (20 DAPs) identified in our work were negatively regulated after HT

446

(Supplementary Table S2). Moreover, we also observed that warmed berries contain lower amount

447

of glycerol 3-phosphate, precursor of the membrane glycerolipids (Figure 3). These lipid-related

448

DAPs are involved in fatty acid (FA) synthesis, FA elongation or FA degradation, among which were

449

the following enzymes: acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC, VIT_18s0001g04980, VIT_11s0065g00360),

450

glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT, VIT_15s0046g02400), beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase

451

(KCS, VIT_13s0067g03890) and phosphoinositide phosphatase (SAC, VIT_04s0044g00030). ACC

452

proteins catalyse the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA during fatty acid synthesis

453

(Sasaki and Nagano 2004). The cytosolic ACCase contributes to the synthesis of very-long chain fatty

454

acids, with a role in membrane stability and biosynthesis of flavonoids. Its lower abundance in

455

warmed berries may negatively impact the flavonoid accumulation upon veraison. The heat-repressive

456

effects observed at the protein level may also lead to a deep remodelling of the berry protection

457

system. Particularly, the down-regulation of some proteins such as GPAT and KCS may disturb the

458

berry protective barrier, namely the cuticle, since these two proteins belong to families involved in

459

cutin and wax biosynthesis, respectively (Guo et al. 2016; Petit et al. 2016). The strongest translational

460

repression was observed for a protein from the SAC (suppressor of actin) family (log2FC: -6.22) when

461

the HS was applied during the green stage. SAC proteins are phosphatases that hydrolyze

462

polyphosphoinositides, and roles in stress responses, cell wall formation, vacuolar trafficking and

463

vacuolar morphology and function have been demonstrated in plants (Novakova et al. 2014). Among

464

the known effects of high temperatures, one of the most relevant is the alteration of membrane-linked

465

processes due to modifications in membrane fluidity and permeability (Niu and Xiang 2018). Heat

466

stress decreases the total content of lipids and glycolipids (Escandon et al. 2018). To preserve

467

membrane integrity under elevated temperatures, plants can regulate the ratio of bilayer to non‐bilayer‐

468

forming lipids (Welti et al. 2007). Plant thermotolerance might also be improved by reducing the

469

membrane content of unsaturated fatty acids or by accumulating more saturated fatty acids prior to

470

HS, thus helping to maintain optimal membrane fluidity (Higashi et al. 2015; Escandon et al. 2018).

471

Accordingly, we found that two desaturase proteins (VIT_05s0094g00750, VIT_00s0499g00030)

472

were down-regulated in warmed berries. Membrane components may also be involved in initiating

473

key signalling pathways that lead to the appropriate plant responses to heat (Niu and Xiang 2018).

474

Consequences of the heat-induced lipid metabolism changes for berry development and quality remain

475

to be determined.

476

The cell wall forms a dynamic boundary for plant cells and plays important roles during grape

477

berry development, governing the potential for cell expansion during fruit growth and modulating the

478

texture of mature berries through the depolymerisation and the solubilisation of cell wall polymers

479

(Goulao et al. 2012b). Cell wall remodelling also constitutes an important component of plant

480

responses to HS that maintain overall function and growth, although the cell wall factors contributing

481

to the acquisition of plant thermotolerance remain largely unknown (Wu et al. 2018). Our previous

482

transcriptomic analysis highlighted the strong effect of HT on genes involved in cell wall homeostasis,

483

and especially on enzymes contributing to cell wall expansion and loosening such as xyloglucan endo-

484

transglycosylase and expansins (Lecourieux et al. 2017). At the protein level, most of the 25 DAPs

485

related to the category “cell wall” displayed lower amounts in heated berries, except for a few proteins

486

among which were two pectin methylesterases (PME, VIT_07s0005g00730, VIT_11s0016g00290)

487

and two polygalacturonases (PG, VIT_02s0025g01330, VIT_08s0007g08330) that accumulate in

488

ripening berries exposed to heat. Both PME and PG are implicated in pectin disassembly and fruit

489

softening process, but it is difficult to assess the impact of changes in these four proteins, since both

490

enzymes belong to large families, with 36 PMEs and 60 PGs being annotated in the reference grape

491

genome (Goulao et al. 2012a). However, there is increasing evidence that cell wall-modifying

492

enzymes are involved in plant responses to HS, and PMEs appear to be key players in the process (Wu

493

et al. 2018). Similar observations were made in fruits of other species exposed to high temperature,

494

such as strawberry (Langer et al. 2018).

495
496

Identification of proteins with a potential role in berry responses to heat

497

Global warming represents a substantial risk for the sustainability of wine production in many regions.

498

Plant breeding combined with molecular plant biotechnology has the potential to deliver stable yields

499

and quality under warmer climate conditions, but this requires the identification of key traits of

500

tolerance to heat (Torregrosa et al. 2017). Our proteomic study revealed 54 DAPs related to the

501

functional category “Stress” and mainly belonging to the “abiotic/heat stress” cluster (Supplementary

502

Table S7; 35 out of the 54 “stress” DAPs). Most of the proteins associated with the “heat stress”

503

category were over-accumulated, mainly at veraison stage, and all were members of the heat shock

504

protein (HSP) family. Looking for potential protective mechanisms activated in berries exposed to HT,

505

we paid particular attention to up-regulated proteins previously described in the HS responses and

506

thermotolerance in other plant species (Table 2; Supplementary Tables S7 and S12). We also listed

507

some proteins that increased in abundance under HT and thus have a putative role in stress tolerance.

508

These proteins (Table 2) are potential markers for developing or selecting grape varieties that are

509

better adapted to warmer climate or the extreme heat waves that are expected due to climate change.

510

Cabernet Sauvignon berry can improve its HS response abilities by elevating the levels of

511

particular proteins associated with the maintenance of protein homeostasis (synthesis, folding and

512

degradation). HSP/chaperones are considered as powerful buffers against environmental stress

513

including HS. Their chaperone functions include not only protein folding, but also signalling and

514

protein targeting and degradation (Bokszczanin and Fragkostefanakis 2013). Data collected over the

515

last decades suggest that members of the HSP/chaperone network are valuable targets for engineering

516

multiple stress resistance in crops (Jacob et al. 2017). Among the 30 up-regulated HSPs in heat-

517

exposed berries, four of these were increased irrespective of the fruit developmental stage (HSP70,

518

HSP90, HSP101, HSP17.6II), and all of these were described as required for thermotolerance in

519

various plant species (Table 2). Another up-regulated protein under HS corresponds to a Bcl-2-

520

associated athanogene isoform (BAG). Plant BAGs are multifunctional proteins that regulate cell

521

development and contribute to cytoprotection from pathogen attack and abiotic stress (Doukhanina et

522

al. 2006). In particular, AtBAG7 was described to be a key player of the heat-induced unfolded protein

523

response (UPR) pathway that alleviates the detrimental effects of accumulation of misfolded proteins

524

(Li et al. 2017). VvROF1 abundance was also increased in HS conditions. In Arabidopsis, AtROF1

525

encodes a peptidyl prolyl isomerase catalysing the cis/trans isomerization of peptide bonds N‐terminal

526

to proline residues within polypeptide chains. AtROF1 is transcriptionally induced by HT and is

527

involved in acquired thermotolerance through the interaction with HSP90.1 and HSFA2 (Meiri and

528

Breiman 2009). We also observed that two thaumatin-like proteins (VvTLPs) from the osmotin sub-

529

family strongly accumulated in heat stressed berries. The grape genome contains 33 VvTLPs (Yan et

530

al. 2017), and this family is known to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses including

531

grapevine (Liu et al. 2010). Osmotins have been shown to have multiple functions in enhancing stress

532

tolerance in many plant species, although the mechanisms by which osmotins mediate plant response

533

to abiotic stress are not well established (de Jesus-Pires et al. 2019). Finally, a strong increase in the

534

translation initiation factor VveIF5 was detected in heated berries (Table 2). The role of eIF5 in

535

thermotolerance was described in Arabidopsis and pea (Suragani et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017).

536

How plants sense and transduce the HT signal is still an important topic to be addressed. It was

537

reported that phytochromes function as plant thermosensors (Jung et al. 2016). Transduction of the HT

538

signal involves various players (Li et al. 2018), including members of the plasma membrane cyclic

539

nucleotide gated calcium channel family (CNGC). In Arabidopsis, CNGC2 and CNGC6 were

540

described as heat sensors, contributing to the Ca2+ signalling induced by HT and leading to the onset

541

of plant acquired thermotolerance (Finka et al. 2012). Whereas CNGC6 gene is ubiquitously expressed

542

in Arabidopsis (Gao et al. 2012), our results revealed that the protein abundance of the grape ortholog

543

VvCNGC2 increased after berry exposure to heat, underlining the need for de novo synthesis of this

544

protein to achieve its role in thermotolerance.

545

Integration of elevated temperature, signal transduction and the appropriate stress response is

546

mediated, at least partially, by plant hormones (Ku et al. 2018). Several proteins related to hormone

547

homeostasis were seen to be more abundant in heat-exposed berries (Table 2). Four abscisic acid

548

(ABA)-related DAPs were up-regulated in the present study. The first DAP is a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid

549

dioxygenase (NCED). This enzyme catalyses the first committed step in ABA biosynthesis (Tan et al.

550

1997) and NCED overexpression improves drought tolerance in grape (He et al. 2018). At the

551

transcript level, a mixed picture has emerged for the NCED isogenes in HS grape berries (Carbonell-

552

Bejerano et al. 2013; Rienth et al. 2014a; Lecourieux et al. 2017). The second ABA-related DAP was

553

GER5/GRE5, a protein closely related to GEM (GLABRA2 Expression Modulator) and belonging to

554

a subfamily of the GRAM domain-containing proteins (Mauri et al. 2016). In heat-stressed berries,

555

GER5 was up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Table S11). GER5 and

556

closely related GRAM domain genes (GER1, GEM) were proposed to be required in the reproductive

557

development of Arabidopsis whereas a putative role in abiotic stress responses remains unclear

558

(Bhatta et al. 2018). The third ABA-related DAP is an ABA-, stress-, and ripening- (ASR) induced

559

protein known to play prominent roles in the protection of plants against abiotic stress (Gonzalez and

560

Iusem 2014). For instance, the grape ASR VvMSA was reported to be involved in responses to water

561

deficit (Medici et al. 2014). The last ABA-related DAP is RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1).

562

In rice, this protein positively regulates seed germination by controlling endogenous levels of ABA

563

and H2O2 (Zhang et al. 2014). More broadly, plant RACK1 proteins regulate various signalling

564

pathways ranging from developmental processes such as seed germination, flowering and leaf

565

initiation, to immune and stress responses against pathogens and environmental stimuli (Islas-Flores et

566

al. 2015). Another phytohormone-related DAP was a brassinosteroid-related protein phosphatase

567

which accumulated in heated berries. In Arabidopsis, this protein is one of a four-member gene family

568

(BSL, for BRI1-SUPPRESSOR1 Like) shown to participate in brassinosteroid signalling (Maselli et

569

al. 2014), and potentially involved in stress tolerance (Gruszka 2018).

570

Heat stress is accompanied by oxidative stress, which may trigger adverse effects through oxidative

571

damage of cell membranes and important macromolecules (Bokszczanin and Fragkostefanakis 2013).

572

Therefore, redox regulation and signalling have been recognised as crucial mechanisms for acute

573

responses to HT (Katano et al. 2018). Our proteomic analysis of HT berries highlighted several up-

574

regulated DAPs with antioxidant properties, including two glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), a

575

glutathione reductase (GR, VIT_07s0141g0039), one catalase, a protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), an

576

aldo-keto reductase (AKR), two mannitol dehydrogenases (MTD) and an S-nitrosoglutathione

577

reductase (GSNOR). Glutathione S-transferases belong to a well-characterized detoxification enzyme

578

family, catalyzing the conjugation of the reduced glutathione tripeptide (GSH) to electrophilic

579

substrates (Kumar and Trivedi 2018). GSTs quench reactive molecules through the addition of GSH

580

and protect the cell from oxidative damage. Accordingly, plant GSTs play an important role in abiotic

581

and biotic stress responses (Nianiou-Obeidat et al. 2017). The two up-regulated GSTs were observed

582

at veraison but an opposite pattern was seen at ripening with five GST isoforms being strongly

583

repressed at the protein level. This GST down-regulation observed under HT may negatively impact

584

the accumulation efficiency of flavonoids into the vacuolar compartment of ripening berries. Indeed,

585

GSTs function as non-enzymatic carriers in intracellular transport, allowing the accumulation of

586

flavonoid-GSH conjugates into vacuoles (Petrussa et al. 2013). The GST-mediated transport of

587

anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins has been established in grape as well (Perez-Diaz et al. 2016).

588

Among the four other heat-affected proteins, GR catalyses the reduction of glutathione disulfide

589

(GSSG) to GSH, and its role in heat tolerance was described in different plant species (Jegadeesan et

590

al. 2018). The ROS detoxifying enzyme catalase is considered as an acclimation protein required for

591

basal thermotolerance (Vanderauwera et al. 2011), whereas PDI encodes an oxidoreductase enzyme

592

belonging to the thioredoxin superfamily. PDI can be considered as a folding enzyme since it catalyses

593

the formation of correct disulfide bridges between the cysteine residues in proteins to maintain ER-

594

homeostasis (Park and Seo 2015). In potato, StPDI1 was found to interact with a sucrose transporter

595

(StSUT1) (Krugel et al. 2012), and a role in abiotic stress tolerance and H2O2 detoxification was

596

suggested (Eggert et al. 2016). Recently, the heterologous over-expression of a Methanothermobacter

597

thermautotrophicus PDI with a chaperone function and disulfide isomerase activity could confer

598

thermotolerance to transgenic rice (Wang et al. 2018). The aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily

599

contains proteins able to reduce a broad spectrum of substrates, ranging from simple sugars to

600

potentially toxic aldehydes. Plant AKRs are involved in diverse metabolic reactions including reactive

601

aldehyde detoxification, biosynthesis of osmolytes, secondary metabolism and membrane transport.

602

These proteins may also confer multiple stress tolerance (Sengupta et al. 2015), including heat stress

603

tolerance as reported in rice (Turoczy et al. 2011). Two mannitol dehydrogenases (MTD) increased in

604

abundance in grape berries exposed to HT. The role of mannitol and by extension, its catabolic

605

enzyme MTD, is well established in resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. Several studies

606

suggest that mannitol protects plants from various abiotic stresses by acting as an osmoprotectant and

607

by quenching the damaging ROS (Patel and Williamson 2016). In grapevine, VvMTD1 was described

608

as involved in water-deficit stress tolerance (Conde et al. 2015). Finally, GSNOR has an important

609

function in the homeostasis of NO (nitric oxide), which is considered as a broad-spectrum anti-stress

610

molecule when acting at low concentration in plants. Whereas NO was described to accumulate in

611

tobacco exposed to HT (Gould et al. 2003), the key role of GSNOR1-mediated de-nitrosylation in

612

thermotolerance was revealed by the characterization of Arabidopsis hot5 (sensitive to hot

613

temperatures) knock-out mutants (Lee et al. 2008). Taken together, these up-regulated and redox-

614

related proteins may play a role in signalling as well as in preventing harmful effects of ROS and

615

reactive nitrogen species in berries under HS conditions.

616

Finally, our proteomic work highlighted the heat-induced accumulation of two proteins related to

617

vitamin metabolism, namely VvPDX1.2 and VvPANK (Table 2). The pseudoenzyme PDX1.2

618

(Pyridoxine biosynthesis 1) is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B6

619

biosynthesis protein machinery. Transcriptionally regulated by HsfA1, PDX1.2 serves to stabilize the

620

catalytic PDX1s under HT, thereby maintaining vitamin B6 homeostasis in plants (Dell’Aglio et al.

621

2017). AtPDX1.2 was reported as essential for plant growth under heat and oxidative stress conditions

622

(Moccand et al. 2014). The second up-regulated protein corresponds to a pantothenate kinase (PANK).

623

Pantothenate (known as vitamin B5) is the key precursor of CoA and acyl carrier protein, which are

624

essential co-factors for many metabolic enzymes (Raman and Rathinasabapathi 2004). The PANK

625

converts pantothenate to phosphopantothenate, using ATP as phosphate donor. PANK activity plays a

626

critical role in regulating intracellular coenzyme A (CoA) levels in bacteria and animals but little is

627

known about the role of this enzyme in plants (Ottenhof et al. 2004). It was suggested that an

628

increased level of CoA, through an increased PANK activity, may be responsible for improved plant

629

growth and stress resistance (Rubio et al. 2008).

Conclusion

632

Global warming represents a substantial risk for the sustainability of wine production in many regions.

633

Plant breeding combined with molecular plant biotechnology have the potential to deliver stable yields

634

and quality under warmer climate conditions, but this requires the identification of key traits of

635

tolerance to heat. To this end, we combined omics approaches to decipher the molecular components

636

and processes affected in developing Cabernet Sauvignon berries exposed to heat. In the present study,

637

592 differentially abundant proteins were identified in heated berries among which some may play a

638

substantial role in heat tolerance. Our data also show that there is not a straightforward correlation

639

between the heat-modulated berry transcriptome and proteome, indicating the major involvement of

640

post-transcriptional regulation under heat stress. These pronounced changes contribute on the one

641

hand to generate fruit damaging effects, including disruption of carbohydrate and secondary

642

metabolism, and on the other hand to mobilize key heat-signalling players as well as protective

643

molecules such as antioxidants and chaperones (Figure 5). In summary, these findings help elucidate

644

heat-triggering effects on developing grape berries and identify genes and proteins that potentially

645

control heat acclimation in grapevine. The functional characterization of some putative candidates is in

646

progress.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

649

Plant material, temperature and sampling

650

Elevated temperature (+ 8°C) was directed on clusters of V. vinifera Cabernet Sauvignon fruiting

651

cuttings. The HT was applied at three different berry developmental stages and maintained throughout

652

the light period (7:00 am to 7:00 pm) until harvesting. To separate short- and long-term responses,

653

berries were collected after 1 and 7 days of treatment. Details of the experimental protocol and

654

sampling were provided in Lecourieux et al. (2017). The same pools of deseeded berries were used for

655

both the transcriptomic analysis reported in Lecourieux et al. (2017) and the proteomic analysis

656

reported here.

657
658

Tissue preparation and total protein extraction

659

Each biological replicate contained 25 pooled berries underwent independent protein extraction using

660

a protocol adapted from Lücker et al. (2009) and Martinez-Estezo et al. (2011). Briefly, deseeded

661

berries were ground to a fine powder in a mortar with liquid nitrogen and 3 g of frozen ground tissue

662

were used to prepare a total protein extract. Pectins and pigments were removed after incubation of the

663

frozen tissues in 25 mL of a cold (-20°C) ethyl acetate: ethanol (1 : 2 (v/v) for 30 min at -20°C with

664

repeated vortexing. The protein extract was precipitated by centrifugation for 3 min at 21000 × g at

665

4°C, and a second ethyl acetate: ethanol wash was performed in a similar way. The pellet was next

666

extracted twice with cold (-20°C) 100% acetone by vortexing and centrifuging, as before. The pellet

667

was transferred to a mortar and dried in a fume hood until complete acetone evaporation. The dried

668

pellet was finely ground after addition of 1/3 vol of sand, and washed with 1.5 mL chilled 10% (w/v)

669

trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in acetone. This washing step was repeated seven times. This was followed

670

by two washes with aqueous 10% (v/v) TCA, two with chilled 80% (v/v) acetone, and drying at 4 °C.

671

Each washing step included incubation at -20°C for 20 min followed by centrifugation for 3 min at

672

21000 × g at 4°C. Subsequently the dried pellet was resuspended in 500 µL protein extraction buffer

673

containing: 0.7 M sucrose, 0.1 M KCl, 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM EDTA, 1% PVPP, 1%

674

DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Germany), and incubated at room temperature (RT) for

675

30 min with intermittent vortexing. Then, an equal volume of Tris-saturated phenol (pH 7.5) was

676

added, the sample was incubated at RT for 30 min with vortexing every 5 min. After centrifugation at

677

15,000 × g at RT for 40 min, the phenol phase in the upper layer was transferred into a new 2-mL

678

Eppendorf tubes and the remaining aqueous lower phase was re-extracted with another 500 µL Tris-

679

saturated phenol (pH 7.5). The two phenol phases were combined and washed twice with an equal

680

volume of phenol washing buffer (0.7 M sucrose, 0.1 M KCl, 0.5 M Tris (pH 7.0, 50 mM EDTA, 1%

681

DTT, and protease inhibitor cocktail). Proteins contained in the organic phase were precipitated

682

overnight at 4°C with 5 volumes of 0.1 M ammonium acetate in methanol. Precipitated proteins were

683

washed three times in 0.1 M ammonium acetate in methanol and twice in ice-cold 80% (v/v) acetone.

684

All these precipitating and washing steps included incubation for 30 min followed by centrifugation at

685

15,000 × g at 4°C for 40 min. Finally, proteins were dissolved in 200 µL freshly prepared

686

solubilization solution (7 M urea, 70 mM SDS, 20 mM DTT) and quantified according to the Bradford

687

method (Bradford, 1976) with bovine serum albumin as standard.

688
689

Sample preparation and protein digestion

690

Thirty µg of each protein sample (three biological replicates for each condition; 12 conditions in total:

691

three stages x two treatments x two treatment durations) were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and were

692

separated by SDS-PAGE in a 10% (w/v) acrylamide gel. After colloidal blue staining, each lane was

693

horizontally divided into four parts of equal length and each part was subsequently cut in 1 mm x 1

694

mm gel pieces. Gel pieces were destained in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate dissolved in 50% (v/v)

695

acetonitrile (ACN), rinsed twice in ultrapure water and dehydrated in 100% ACN for 10 min. After

696

ACN removal, gel pieces were dried at room temperature, covered with proteolysis solution

697

(containing 10 ng/µl trypsin dissolved in 40 mM NH4HCO3 and 10% (v/v) ACN), rehydrated at 4 °C

698

for 10 min, and finally incubated overnight at 37 °C. The gel pieces were then incubated for 15 min in

699

40 mM NH4HCO3 and 10% (v/v) ACN at room temperature with rotary shaking. The supernatant was

700

collected, and an H2O/ACN/formic acid (47.5:47.5:5 by volume) extraction solution was added and

701

gel slices incubated for 15 min. The extraction step was repeated twice. Supernatants were pooled and

702

concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge to a final volume of 40 µL. Digests were finally acidified by

703

addition of 2.4 µL of 5% (v/v) formic acid and the resulting peptide mixtures stored at -20 °C until

704

analysis.

705
706

nLC-MS/MS analysis

707

Peptide mixtures were analyzed on an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system (Dionex, Amsterdam, The

708

Netherlands) coupled to a nanospray LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San

709

Jose, USA). Ten microliters of peptide mixtures were loaded onto a 300-µm-inner diameter x 5-mm

710

C18 PepMapTM trap column (LC Packings) at a flow rate of 30 µL/min. The peptides were eluted from

711

the trap column onto an analytical 75-mm id x 15-cm C18 Pep-Map column (LC Packings) with a 5–

712

40% linear gradient of solvent B in 105 min (solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in 5% ACN, and solvent

713

B was 0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN). The separation flow rate was set at 200 nL/min. The mass

714

spectrometer operated in positive ion mode at a 1.8-kV needle voltage and a 39-V capillary voltage.

715

Data were acquired in a data-dependent mode alternating a Fourier transform mass spectrometry

716

(FTMS) scan survey over the range m/z 300–1700 and six ion trap MS/MS scans with CID (Collision

717

Induced Dissociation) as activation mode. MS/MS spectra were acquired using a 3-m/z unit ion

718

isolation window and a normalized collision energy of 35%. Only +2 and +3 charge-state ions were

719

selected for fragmentation. Dynamic exclusion duration was set to 30s.

720
721

Database search and MS data processing

722

Data were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm (supported by the Proteome Discoverer 1.4

723

software; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) against a subset of the 2012.01 version of UniProt database

724

restricted to Vitis vinifera Reference Proteome Set (29,817 entries). Spectra from peptides higher than

725

5000 Da or lower than 350 Da were rejected. The search parameters were as follows: mass accuracy of

726

the monoisotopic peptide precursor and peptide fragments was set to 10 ppm and 0.8 Da respectively.

727

Only b- and g-ions were considered for mass calculation. Oxidation of methionines (+16 Da) was

728

considered as a variable modification. Two missed trypsin cleavages were allowed. Peptide validation

729

was performed using the Percolator algorithm (Käll et al. 2007), and only “high confidence” peptides

730

were retained corresponding to a 1% false positive rate at the peptide level.

731
732

Label-Free Quantitative Data Analysis

733

Raw LC-MS/MS data were imported into the Progenesis LC-MS 4.0 (Non Linear Dynamics)

734

software. Data processing includes the following steps: (i) Features detection, (ii) Features alignment

735

across the six samples for each part, (iii) Volume integration for 2-6 charge-state ions, (iv)

736

Normalization on total protein abundance, (v) Import of sequence information, (vi) ANOVA test at the

737

peptide level and filtering for features p <0.05, (vii) Calculation of protein abundance (sum of the

738

volume of corresponding peptides), (viii) ANOVA test at protein level and filtering for features p

739

<0.05. Only non-conflicting features and unique peptides were considered for calculation at the

740

protein level. Quantitative data were considered for proteins quantified by a minimum of two peptides.

741

The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via

742

the PRIDE (Perez-Riverol et al. 2019) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD014693.

743

Protein abundance changes between control and heat-exposed fruits were considered to be

744

significant when a minimum fold change of 1.5 (log2FC > 0.58 or < -0.58) was reached, with a

745

significance threshold of p < 0.05. Only proteins identified in all three biological replicates were

746

considered for quantification. Significantly affected protein categories based on the MapMan

747

Ontology (Usadel et al., 2005) were identified using a Chi-square test. MapMan mappings for the

Primary metabolism quantification

752

Deseeded berries were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and aliquots (15–20 mg) of frozen

753

powder were extracted with chloroform/methanol as described by Lunn et al. (2006). Primary

754

metabolites were measured by LC-MS/MS as described by Lunn et al. (2006), with modifications as

755

described in Figueroa et al. (2016) and Dai et al. (2013).

Figure 1. Venn diagrams displaying the numbers of DAPs in heat-treated berries, according to

1179

the developmental stage (A) or the treatment duration (B). DAPs were selected using a 1.5 fold

1180

expression change and an adjusted p < 0.05 (with FDR correction). Only proteins identified in all three

1181

biological replicates and with a minimum of two unique peptides were considered for quantification.

1182

The detailed information of the common DAPs upon HT for each stage or for each exposure time was

1183

listed as in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Figure 3. Metabolite profiles of Cabernet Sauvignon developing berries exposed (red line) or not

1190

(blue line) to heat stress. Metabolites are shown in their respective metabolic pathways (sugar

1191

metabolism, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle) and their temporal profiles during berry treatment

1192

(µmol.g–1 FW for glucose, and fructose; and nmol.g–1 FW for the others) are presented alongside. For

1193

each profile, the x-axis shows the developing stage (G: middle-green, V: véraison and R: middle-

1194

ripening) and the stress duration (1, 7 and 14 days).

Figure 4. Correlation between the expression of proteins and mRNAs in developing control and

1197

HT berries. DAPs and DEGs were selected using a 1.5 and 2 fold expression change, respectively,

1198

and an adjusted p < 0.05 (with FDR correction). Venn diagrams display the number of DAPs and

1199

DEGs (red: up-regulated and blue: down-regulated) according to the developing stage (A: middle-

1200

Figure 1. Venn diagrams displaying the numbers of DAPs in heat-treated berries, according to

1251

the developmental stage (A) or the treatment duration (B). DAPs were selected using a 1.5 fold

1252

expression change and an adjusted p < 0.05 (with FDR correction). Only proteins identified in all three

1253

biological replicates and with a minimum of two unique peptides were considered for quantification.

1254

The detailed information of the common DAPs upon HT for each stage or for each exposure time was

1255

listed as in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Figure 3. Metabolite profiles of Cabernet Sauvignon developing berries exposed (red line) or not

1265

(blue line) to heat stress. Metabolites are shown in their respective metabolic pathways (sugar

1266

metabolism, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle) and their temporal profiles during berry treatment

1267

(µmol.g–1 FW for glucose, and fructose; and nmol.g–1 FW for the others) are presented alongside. For

1268

each profile, the x-axis shows the developing stage (G: middle-green, V: véraison and R: middle-

1269

ripening) and the stress duration (1, 7 and 14 days).
