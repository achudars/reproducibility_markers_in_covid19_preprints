Abstract:

22

Males and females often produce distinct responses to the same sensory stimuli. How such

23

differences arise – at the level of sensory processing or in the circuits that generate behavior

24

– remains largely unresolved across sensory modalities. We address this issue in the acoustic

25

communication system of Drosophila. During courtship, males generate time-varying songs,

26

and each sex responds with specific behaviors. We characterize male and female behavioral

27

tuning for all aspects of song, and show that feature tuning is similar between sexes,

28

suggesting sex-shared song detectors drive divergent behaviors. We then identify higher-

29

order neurons in the Drosophila brain, called pC2, that are tuned for multiple temporal aspects

30

of one mode of the male’s song, and drive sex-specific behaviors. We thus uncover neurons

31

that are specifically tuned to an acoustic communication signal and that reside at the sensory-

32

motor interface, flexibly linking auditory perception with sex-specific behavioral responses.

Introduction

35

Across animals, males and females produce distinct, dimorphic behaviors in response to

36

common sensory stimuli (e.g., pheromones, visual cues, or acoustic signals), and these

37

differences are critical for social and reproductive behaviors (Billeter and Levine, 2013;

38

Dulac and Wagner, 2006; Kelley, 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2013; Yang and Shah, 2014). The

39

molecular dissection of sexual dimorphisms in the nervous system of flies and mice in

40

particular (Cachero et al., 2010; Dulac and Wagner, 2006; Rideout et al., 2010; Stowers and

41

Logan, 2010; Yang and Shah, 2014; Yu et al., 2010) has identified neurons involved in either

42

processing important social cues or driving social behaviors, but it remains open as to how

43

sex-specific behaviors to common sensory signals emerge along sensorimotor pathways. It

44

could be that males and females process sensory information differently, leading to different

45

behavioral outcomes, or that males and females process sensory information identically, but

46

drive different behaviors downstream of common detectors.

47
48

This issue has been most heavily investigated for pheromone processing. In Drosophila, the

49

male pheromone cVA induces either aggression in males (Wang and Anderson, 2010) or

50

receptivity in females (Billeter et al., 2009; Kurtovic et al., 2007). The pheromone is detected

51

by shared circuits in males and females and the similarly processed sensory information

52

(Datta et al., 2008) is then routed to sex-specific higher-order olfactory neurons (Kohl et al.,

53

2013; Ruta et al., 2010) that likely exert different effects on behavior, although this

54

hypothesis has not yet been tested. In the mouse, the male pheromone ESP1 triggers

55

lordosis in females, but has no effect on male behavior. This pheromone activates V2Rp5

56

sensory neurons in both sexes but, analogous to cVA processing in flies, these neurons

57

exhibit sex-specific projection patterns in the hypothalamus that drive sex-specific behavioral

58

responses (Haga et al., 2010; Ishii et al., 2017). For pheromone processing then, the rule

59

appears to be that early olfactory processing is largely shared between the sexes and then

60

common percepts are routed to separate higher-order neurons or circuits for control of

61

differential behaviors. But does this rule apply for other modalities, or for stimuli that can be

62

defined by multiple temporal or spatial scales (e.g. visual objects or complex sounds)? For

63

such stimuli, selectivity typically emerges in higher-order neurons (Dicarlo et al., 2012;

64

Gentner, 2008; Tsao and Livingstone, 2008) and we do not yet know if such neurons are

65

shared between males and females, and therefore if dimorphic responses emerge in

66

downstream circuits.

68

Here, we investigate this issue in the auditory system in Drosophila. Similar to birds (Fortune

69

et al., 2011; Konishi, 1985), frogs (Gerhardt and Huber, 2002), or other insects (Ronacher et

70

al., 2014), acoustic communication in Drosophila involves different behaviors in males and

71

females relative to the courtship song. During courtship, males chase females and produce

72

a species-specific song that comprises two major modes – pulse song consists of trains of

73

brief pulses and sine song consists of a sustained harmonic oscillation (Bennet-Clark and

74

Ewing, 1967). In contrast with males, females are silent but arbitrate mating decisions

75

(Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1969). Males use visual feedback cues from the female (rapid

76

changes in her walking speed and her distance relative to him) to determine which song

77

mode (sine or pulse) to produce over time (Clemens et al., 2017; Coen et al., 2014; 2016) –

78

this gives rise to the variable structure of song bouts (Fig. 1A). Receptive females slow in

79

response to song (Aranha et al., 2017; Bussell et al., 2014; Clemens et al., 2015; Coen et

80

al., 2014; Cook, 1973; Crossley et al., 1995; F. Von Schilcher, 1976; Tompkins et al., 1982),

81

while playback of courtship song to males in the presence of other flies can induce them to

82

increase their walking speed (Crossley et al., 1995; F. Von Schilcher, 1976; Vaughan et al.,

83

2014), and to display courtship-like behaviors (Eberl et al., 1997; Li et al., 2018; Yoon et al.,

84

2013; Zhou et al., 2015). These behavioral differences surrounding song production and

85

perception between Drosophila males and females, combined with the wealth of genetic and

86

neural circuit tools, make the Drosophila acoustic communication system an excellent one in

87

which to investigate whether males and females share common sensory detection strategies

88

for their courtship song, and how divergent behaviors arise.

89
90

Each major mode of Drosophila courtship song, sine or pulse, contains patterns on multiple

91

temporal scales (Arthur et al., 2013; Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1967) (Fig. 1A) – neurons that

92

represent either the pulse or sine mode should in theory bind all of the temporal features of

93

each mode, similar to object detectors in other systems (Bizley and Cohen, 2013; Dicarlo et

94

al., 2012; Gentner and Margoliash, 2003; Griffiths and Warren, 2004), and their tuning

95

should match behavioral tuning. Historically, behaviorally relevant song features have been

96

defined based on the parameters of the species’ own song (Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1969).

97

However, there is now ample evidence that the preferred song can diverge from the

98

conspecific song (Amézquita et al., 2011; Blankers et al., 2015; Ryan et al., 2001) – for

99

instance if females prefer exaggerated song features (Rosenthal and Ryan, 2011; Ryan and

100

Cummings, 2013) or respond to signal parameters not normally produced by their male

101

conspecifics (Hennig et al., 2016). It is therefore important to define song modes by the

102

acoustic tuning of specific behavioral outputs. This has been done for other insects (e.g.

103

(Clemens and Hennig, 2013; D. von Helversen and O. von Helversen, 1997)) but never for

104

flies in a systematic way that also permits a direct comparison between sexes.

105
106

To that end, we developed a behavioral assay for assessing dynamic changes in walking

107

speed in response to sound playback in both sexes, and we then measured locomotor

108

tuning for all features of either pulse or sine song. We found that males and females have

109

similar tuning but different behavioral responses and that they are tuned for every major

110

feature of the song. We then identified a small set of sexually dimorphic neurons, termed

111

pC2 (Kimura et al., 2015; Rideout et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2014), that serve as shared pulse

112

song detectors in both sexes: the tuning of pC2 neurons is matched to behavioral tuning for

113

pulse song – but not for sine song – across a wide range of temporal scales. We find that

114

optogenetic activation of pC2 is sufficient to drive sex-specific behaviors – changes in

115

locomotion with sex-specific dynamics as well as singing in males – and that silencing pC2

116

neurons biases males to production of sine song. pC2 is therefore both sensory and motor

117

with regard to pulse song – it is important both for pulse song processing and pulse song

118

generation. Finally, we establish the importance of pC2 neurons by showing that early social

119

experience changes both the tuning of these neurons and the tuning of the behavior. Our

120

results indicate that the fly brain contains common pulse song detectors in males and

121

females which control sex-specific behavioral responses to song via downstream circuits.

122
123

Results

124

Comprehensive characterization of behavioral tuning for courtship song features

125

We designed a single-fly playback assay in which individual males or females receive

126

acoustic stimuli in the absence of any confounding social interactions, and we implemented

127

an automated tracker to analyze changes in locomotion relative to acoustic playback (Fig.

128

1B and Movie S1). The assay (which we refer to as FLyTRAP (Fly Locomotor TRacking and

129

Acoustic Playback)) monitors dynamic changes in walking speed, which provides a readout

130

that can be directly compared between both males and females, as opposed to slower

131

readouts of sex-specific behaviors such as the female time to copulation (Bennet-Clark and

132

Ewing, 1969; Zhou et al., 2014) or male-male chaining (Yoon et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015).

133

Because of the high-throughput nature of our assay combined with automated tracking, we

134

can easily test a large number of flies and song parameters, including those only rarely

135

produced by conspecifics but to which animals might be sensitive (Coen et al. 2014; Aranha

et al., 2017; Bussell et al., 2014; Crossley et al., 1995; Eberl et al., 1997; Rybak et al.,

137

2002a; 2002b; F. Von Schilcher, 1976; Yoon et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015). Using

138

FLyTRAP, we systematically compared male and female locomotor tuning to 82 acoustic

139

stimuli that span the features and timescales present in courtship song (see Supplemental

140

Table 1). Typically, each stimulus was presented 23 times to 120 females and 120 males,

141

generating >2500 responses per stimulus and sex (see Methods).

142
143

Previous studies that assayed either male-female copulation rates or male-male chaining

144

often focused on behavioral selectivity for the interval between pulses in a pulse train (inter-

145

pulse interval (IPI), Fig. 1A) (Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1969; Rybak et al., 2002b; F. Von

146

Schilcher, 1976; Zhou et al., 2015). We therefore started by examining behavioral tuning for

147

IPI using the wild type strain NM91, whose acoustic response during courtship was

148

previously characterized(Clemens et al., 2015; 2018a; Coen et al., 2016; 2014). Observed

149

changes in speed were stimulus-locked, sex-specific and tuned to IPI (Fig. 1C). Varying

150

stimulus intensity had minimal effect on pulse song responses (Fig. S1A, B). While females

151

slowed down to pulse trains, males exhibited transient slowing at pulse train onset followed

152

by a long-lasting acceleration. The transient component of the locomotor response was

153

present for all stimuli (Fig. S1C, D, see S3A-C) and may correspond to an unspecific startle

154

response to sound onset (Lehnert et al., 2013). The transient was also present in females

155

but masked by the stimulus-dependent slowing that followed (Fig. 1C). Due to the briefness

156

of the transient response, the integral change in speed following stimulus onset reflects

157

mostly the speed during the sustained phase (Fig. S1C, D). For simplicity, we therefore used

158

the full integral as an overall measure of behavioral tuning. We found that in FLyTRAP,

159

female IPI tuning is a band-pass filter matched to the statistics of male song (Fig. 1D): the

160

mode of the distribution of Drosophila melanogaster IPIs is centered between 30 and 50 ms

161

and females decrease their speed most for the same IPI range, and less for shorter or

162

longer IPIs. Males produced a similar band-pass tuning curve peaked at the same IPI range

163

- but their locomotor response was opposite in sign (males accelerated, females

164

decelerated). This is consistent with the results of other assays that have found band-pass

165

tuning for IPI in both sexes (Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1969; Rybak et al., 2002b; F. Von

166

Schilcher, 1976; Zhou et al., 2015) and a sex-specific sign of locomotor responses (Crossley

167

et al., 1995; F. Von Schilcher, 1976).

169

Interestingly, we found the behavioral tuning for IPI in seven additional wild type strains to

170

still be sex-specific but different from strain NM91 (Fig. S2A) – these strains showed

171

reduced tuning for IPI, even though these same wild type strains – including NM91 – display

172

similar responses to song features in a more natural courtship assay (Clemens et al., 2017;

173

2015; Coen et al., 2016; 2014). This indicates that these other strains may require additional

174

cues (e.g., pheromones or visual cues) not present in FLyTRAP to fully express their

175

preference for conspecific song features. For all subsequent analyses of locomotor tuning in

176

FLyTRAP, we therefore chose the NM91 strain since i) acoustic responses during courtship

177

were previously characterized (Clemens et al., 2018a; 2015; Coen et al., 2016; 2014), ii) it

178

produced responses to song that were similar to the genetic background used for calcium

179

imaging experiments (Fig. S2B-E), and iii) produced song responses that were consistent

180

with those found using other assays (Crossley et al., 1995; Li et al., 2018; F. Von Schilcher,

181

1976; Yoon et al., 2013) – for example showing slowing to pulse song in females versus

182

acceleration to pulse song in males.

183
184

We next systematically varied parameters that characterize pulse song to cover (and extend

185

beyond) the distribution of each parameter within D. melanogaster male song (just as we did

186

for IPI) (see Fig. S3). We examined behavioral tuning in both sexes for parameters that

187

varied on timescales of milliseconds (carrier frequency, pulse duration and IPI) to seconds

188

(pulse train duration) (Fig. 1A). We found that male and female tuning curves are of opposite

189

sign but similar shape for all pulse song features tested across time scales (Fig. 2A, B, see

190

Fig. S3A-C for speed traces, S3D-F), and that the behavioral tuning for pulse parameters

191

often overlapped the distribution found in natural song (Fig. 2C). While the behavioral tuning

192

curves for all pulse song features on short time scales are band-pass with a well-defined

193

peak, we found that tuning for pulse train duration was monotonous: both females and males

194

increase their locomotor response with increasing pulse train duration up to four seconds

195

(Fig. 2A, B). During natural courtship, pulse trains longer than four seconds are rarely

196

produced (Coen et al., 2014) – these stimuli thus correspond to “supernormal“ stimuli which

197

drive strong behavioral response probably due to integration over long time scales

198

(Tinbergen, 1989). Males also produce two distinct types of pulses (Clemens et al., 2018a) –

199

we find that while females appear to be broadly tuned for both types of pulses in the

200

FLyTRAP assay, males respond preferentially to higher frequency pulses (Fig. 2A, B).

201

Finally, we found that both males and females are more selective for the pulse duration

202

versus the pulse pause, the two components of the IPI (Fig. S3D-F) – this is in contrast to

203

other insects that produce and process song pulses (e.g. crickets, grasshoppers, katydids),

204

and that are preferentially tuned to pulse pause, pulse period or pulse train duty cycle

205

(Hennig et al., 2014; Ronacher et al., 2014).

206
207

We next tested locomotor tuning for the parameters that characterize sine stimuli – carrier

208

frequency and the duration of sine trains (Fig. 1A). Both males and females slow for sine

209

tones of different frequencies, with very low and very high frequencies eliciting the strongest

210

responses (Fig. 2A, B and Fig. S3A-C). Notably, the frequencies inducing the strongest

211

slowing (100 Hz) are not typically produced by males (Fig. 2C). As for sine train duration

212

tuning, we observed sustained responses that increased with duration and saturated only

213

weakly, possibly because of the weak response magnitude.

214
215

Pulse and sine song usually co-occur within a single bout but it is not known why males

216

produce two different modes (although females respond to both during natural courtship

217

(Clemens et al., 2017; Coen et al., 2014)). One possibility is that one mode exerts a priming

218

effect on the other (F. V. Schilcher, 1976). To test interactions between the two song modes,

219

we presented sequences in which a 2-second pulse train was followed by a 2-second sine

220

tone or in which a sine tone was followed by a pulse train and compared the responses for

221

these sequences to the responses to an individual pulse train or sine tone (Fig. S3G). The

222

responses are well explained by a linear combination of the responses to individual sine or

223

pulse trains. Deviations from linearity occur due to sound onset responses, but otherwise

224

responses do not strongly depend on the order of presentation in a bout (see also (Talyn

225

and Dowse, 2004)). This suggests that these stimuli are processed in independent

226

pathways.

227
228

To summarize, we compared behavioral responses in males and females from the strain

229

NM91 for all features that define the courtship song. We found that male and female speed

230

changes were strongly correlated for both song modes but that the sign of the correlation

231

was negative for pulse stimuli and positive for sine stimuli (Fig. 2E). The opposite sign of the

232

correlations along with the independence of responses to sine and pulse stimuli (Fig. S3G)

233

indicates that sine and pulse song are processed by different circuits. The large magnitude

234

of the correlations implies that feature tuning of the behavioral responses is similar between

235

sexes and suggests that detector neurons for each song mode should be shared between

236

sexes.

237
238

Hearing pulse song drives wing extension in males, but not in females

239

Another sex-specific aspect of song responses is courtship: playback of conspecific song

240

induces courtship-like behavior in males – this can even be directed towards other males,

241

leading to the male chaining response, in which males follow other males, chasing and

242

extending their wings (Eberl et al., 1997; F. Von Schilcher, 1976; Yoon et al., 2013). In our

243

single-fly assay, males lack a target for courtship and the song-induced arousal likely

244

manifests as an increase in speed. Since FLyTRAP does not permit simultaneous recording

245

of fly acoustic signals during playback, we quantified wing extension as a proxy for singing,

246

and examined whether song playback alone drives singing in solitary males. We found that

247

solitary males extend their wings in response to pulse song stimuli specifically (Fig. 2F, G,

248

Movie S2). This behavior is tuned for the inter-pulse interval (similar to the locomotor

249

response, Fig. 1D) – the conspecific IPI of 36 ms drives the most wing extension, and

250

shorter and longer IPIs evoke fewer wing extensions. By contrast, conspecific sine song

251

(150 Hz) does not induce wing extension (Fig. 2F) (see also (Eberl et al., 1997; Yoon et al.,

252

2013)). We also found that playback of pulse does not elicit wing extension in females, even

253

though females have been shown to possess functional circuitry for singing (Clyne and

254

Miesenböck, 2008; Rezával et al., 2016) – wing extension in response to pulse song is thus

255

sex-specific.

256

These results are consistent with those for locomotor tuning: pulse song, but not sine song,

257

generates sex-specific differences in the behavior of the strain NM91. The identical tuning of

258

the two behavioral responses in males (locomotion (Fig. 1C) and song production (Fig. 2G))

259

suggests that the behavioral responses are driven by a common circuit.

260
261

Drosophila male and female brains share pulse song detector neurons

262

Our systematic exploration of song stimulus space using the FLyTRAP assay revealed

263

behavioral tuning for song parameters across temporal scales (from the carrier frequencies

264

of sine and pulse lasting milliseconds to the duration of sine and pulse trains lasting

265

seconds). We next searched for neurons with tuning across temporal scales that detect

266

either the pulse or sine mode of courtship song. We focused on neurons expressing the

267

Doublesex (Dsx) transcription factor that regulates sexual dimorphism in cell number and

268

neuronal morphology between males and females. In the central brain there are ~70 Dsx+

269

neurons per hemisphere in females and ~140 Dsx+ neurons per hemisphere in males

270

(Kimura et al., 2015; Rideout et al., 2010). Previous studies found calcium responses to both

271

song-like stimuli and pheromones in Dsx+ neuron projections in females (Zhou et al., 2014)

272

and tuning for the inter-pulse interval in males (Zhou et al., 2015). In addition, silencing

273

subsets of Dsx+ neurons in females affected receptivity (Zhou et al., 2014). These data

274

suggest that Dsx+ neurons could serve as the common pulse song detectors in males and

275

females. To test this possibility, we recorded auditory responses in Dsx+ neurons and

276

examined tuning for song features across timescales, in both males and females, to

277

compare with our behavioral results.

278
279

We imaged neural activity using the calcium sensor GCaMP6m (Chen et al., 2013)

280

expressed only in Dsx+ neurons. While we found no auditory response in the superior

281

medial protocerebrum (SMP), we did find responses in the lateral junction (LJ) (Cachero et

282

al., 2010; Ito et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2010), a site of convergence for the majority of Dsx+

283

neuron projections (Fig. 3A, B, S5B, C, Movie S3, S4). We found that male and female Dsx+

284

projections in the LJ are driven strongly by pulse but not by sine stimuli (Fig. 3C), confirming

285

previous results (Zhou et al., 2014). While males produce weaker responses to auditory

286

stimuli compared with females (Fig. 3C), the selectivity of Dsx+ LJ responses is highly

287

correlated between sexes – stimuli that evoked the strongest responses in females also

288

evoked the strongest responses in males (Fig. 3D).

289
290

When examining neuronal tuning curves, we found a good match between Dsx+ LJ

291

responses and the magnitude of changes in speed across all timescales of pulse song in

292

both sexes (Fig. 3E, F). Results were similar whether we used the integral ΔF/F or the peak

293

ΔF/F to quantify tuning (Fig. S4F, G). For example, the Dsx+ LJ tuning curve for IPI is similar

294

in females and males with the strongest responses at 36 ms, matching the behavioral tuning

295

curves (compare with Fig. 2A-B and S2B-C). On longer timescales, LJ tuning curves also

296

match behavioral tuning curves for pulse train duration, with the integral calcium increasing

297

with train duration in both sexes, similar to the behavioral response. Overall, LJ responses

298

are highly selective for multiple features found in conspecific pulse song: Dsx+ LJ responses

299

were strongest for stimuli with a carrier frequency of 250 Hz, an inter-pulse interval of 36 ms,

300

and a pulse duration of 16 ms (Fig. S4C-E). A match in only two of these three features was

301

not sufficient to maximally drive Dsx+ LJ projections (Fig. 3G) – a mismatch in a single pulse

302

song feature reduced calcium responses between 20% and 80%. Sine stimuli have lower

303

carrier frequencies, long durations, and no pauses (they are by definition continuous) –

304

which explains the weak responses of Dsx+ LJ neurons to all sine stimuli (Fig. 3C).

305

Likewise, broadband noise also lacks the correct pattern of amplitude modulations and

306

accordingly does not strongly drive the Dsx+ LJ neurons (see also Fig. 4D). Given this high

307

selectivity for the features defining conspecific pulse song, it is unlikely that the LJ would be

308

driven by other naturally occurring stimuli. For instance, wind stimuli typically contain lower

309

frequencies (Nagel and Wilson, 2011) and lack the periodical pattern of pulse trains required

310

to strongly drive Dsx+ LJ neurons, and aggression song differs from courtship pulse song in

311

carrier frequency and in IPI (Versteven et al., 2017).

312
313

To more directly show that Dsx+ LJ neurons are shared pulse song detectors, we matched

314

neuronal and behavioral responses for the same stimuli. Given the observed strain-

315

dependence of behavioral responses in FLyTRAP (Fig. S2A), we compared behavioral and

316

neuronal tuning within the same genotype (Dsx/GCaMP). In FLyTRAP, Dsx/GCaMP flies

317

produced weaker behavioral responses, but nonetheless, their tuning for song features was

318

matched to that of wild type strain NM91 (Fig. S2B-E). Male neural and behavioral tuning for

319

pulse stimuli are positively correlated (r=0.61, p=1x10-5) – high Dsx+ LJ neuron activity

320

correlates with the most acceleration (Fig. 3H). Female neural and behavioral tuning for

321

pulse stimuli are negatively correlated (r=-0.53, p=3x10-4) – high Dsx+ LJ neuron activity

322

correlates with the most slowing (Fig. 3I). This is consistent with these neurons controlling

323

the magnitude, but not the direction of speed changes. We observed no statistically

324

significant correlation for sine stimuli (male: r=0.17, p=0.49; female: r=0.28, p=0.25), as

325

Dsx+ LJ responses to sine stimuli were weak. We obtained a similar pattern of correlations

326

when using behavioral data from the wild type strain NM91 for comparison instead (Fig.

327

S4H-I). Note that Dsx+ LJ activity only accounts for roughly 1/3 of the variability in behavioral

328

responses for pulse song. This suggests that the behavior is driven and modulated by

329

additional pathways outside of the Dsx+ neurons in the LJ or that most of the variability

330

arises in downstream circuits. Nonetheless, Dsx+ neurons that innervate the LJ have tuning

331

properties expected for pulse song detectors – they prefer pulse over sine stimuli, are

332

similarly tuned in males and females, and their feature tuning matches the behavioral tuning

333

for all pulse, but not sine, stimuli across timescales.

334
335

Dsx+ pC2 neurons are tuned like the LJ and to conspecific pulse song

336

The Dsx+ neurons of the central brain form a morphologically heterogeneous population with

337

several distinct, anatomical clusters many of which project to the LJ (Kimura et al., 2015;

338

Rideout et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2015; 2014) (Fig. 3A). Previous studies that examined

339

auditory responses in Dsx+ neurons (Zhou et al., 2015; 2014) did not resolve which subtype

340

carried the response. Using a stochastic labeling approach (Nern et al., 2015), we confirmed

341

that five out of eight Dsx+ cell types in the female brain have projections into the LJ (Kimura

342

et al., 2015): pC1, pC2l/m, pMN1, and pMN2, but not pCd1/2 and aDN (Fig. 4A and Fig.

343

S5D, E). We next imaged calcium responses to pulse and sine stimuli in the somas of all five

344

Dsx+ cell types that innervate the LJ and found that a subset of neurons in the pC1 and pC2

345

clusters possess auditory responses, in addition to cell type pMN2 (a VNC-projecting

346

female-specific neuron (Kimura et al., 2015) comprising only one cell body per hemisphere)

347

(Fig. 4B, C, Movie S5, S6). All responsive cells preferred pulse over sine or noise stimuli

348

(Fig. 4D). We did not observe auditory responses in pMN1 neurons (not shown), although

349

we cannot rule out that this neuron class has responses that are below the level of detection

350

by the Calcium indicator GCaMP6m.

351
352

The pC1 cluster – which was previously considered the only Dsx+ auditory neuron in the LJ

353

(Zhou et al., 2015; 2014) – contained very few somas with calcium responses to sound (2-3

354

cells in the female brain; none in the male brain) (Fig. 4C). By contrast, we found ~15

355

auditory neurons in the pC2 cluster in each animal (this number is an underestimate since

356

somas overlap; see Methods). While pC1 and pMN2 likely contribute to the LJ responses,

357

they contain few auditory-responsive neurons and/or are present only in females. We

358

therefore focused on pC2 as the putative pulse song detector common to both sexes.

359
360

Although there are more pC2 neurons in males versus females (~67 vs. ~26, (Kimura et al.,

361

2015)) the number of auditory neurons is similar in both sexes (~15). pC2 neurons can be

362

subdivided into a lateral and a medial type, termed pC2l and pC2m (Robinett et al., 2010),

363

and each type projects to the lateral junction via a distinct bundle of neurites (see Fig. 3A,

364

S5B, C). Most auditory neurons were lateral in the pC2 cluster in both sexes (Fig. S5A), and

365

pC2l neurites produced strong auditory responses. However, we did observe auditory

366

responses from some pC2m neurons indicating that auditory activity is not exclusive to pC2l

367

(Fig. S5A). While tuning differed slightly between individual pC2 neurons, no single cell was

368

specialized to detect specific features of the pulse song (Fig. S5F) and responses of single

369

cells and the LJ were highly correlated in both sexes (Fig. 4F-H). From this we conclude that

370

LJ responses reflect the tuning of pC2l neurons. Importantly, the tuning of the pC2l neurites

371

in the LJ matches the behavioral tuning in both sexes (Fig. 4I-J and Fig. S5G-H), indicating

372

that pC2l neurons are selective for conspecific pulse song.

373
374

Circuits parallel to or downstream of pC2l strongly contribute to behavioral variability

375

The match between behavioral and pC2 tuning suggests that pC2 contributes to the sex-

376

specific responses to song. If locomotor responses were driven mainly by pC2, then the

377

variability in pC2 tuning across animals would explain most of the variability in behavioral

378

responses across animals. On the other hand, if locomotor responses were controlled by

379

parallel pathways or by circuits downstream of pC2, then the variability in pC2 would be

380

much lower than the behavioral variability across animals. We compared individual variability

381

of male song, female pC2 neural responses, and female locomotor responses (Fig. 4K) and

382

focused on the pulse song feature for which we had the most data – inter-pulse interval (IPI).

383

We found a steady increase in variability from song to brain to behavior. Song is consistent

384

across individuals – the IPI distribution for each male peaks between 36 and 56 ms. pC2

385

(LJ) responses are more variable than song but still relatively consistent across animals –

386

pC2 in 7/11 females responds most strongly between 36 and 76 ms. By contrast, behavioral

387

responses are highly variable – only half of the flies slow most strongly to IPIs between 36

388

and 76 ms. Variability at the level of locomotor responses increases for other song features,

389

too (data not shown). Overall, this suggests that locomotor responses in FLyTRAP are

390

strongly affected by pathways parallel or downstream of pC2. This must be considered when

391

interpreting experiments that test the role of pC2 in driving behavioral responses to song.

392
393

Activation and inactivation of pC2l neurons affects sex-specific behaviors

394

Given that pC2l neurons are tuned to the conspecific pulse song, we expected that their

395

activation could also contribute to the sex-specific behaviors observed for pulse song –

396

changes in locomotion and singing that are distinct between males and females. To test this

397

hypothesis, we used a driver line (Rezával et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2014)) that labels 11/22

398

female and 22/36 male pC2l neurons, in addition to 5-6 pCd neurons, but no pC2m or pC1

399

neurons (Fig. S6A). At least 5 of the pC2l cells in this driver line responded to song (Fig.

400

S6B), which corresponds to ~1/3 of the auditory pC2l neurons. We expressed CsChrimson,

401

a red-shifted channelrhodopsin (Klapoetke et al., 2014), in these neurons and

402

optogenetically activated them in both males and females.

403
404

We first recorded behavior in a chamber tiled with microphones (Coen et al., 2014) to test

405

whether pC2 activation was sufficient to induce singing, as we previously showed that pulse

406

song playback alone drives wing extension in males (Fig. 2F, G). Upon red light activation,

407

males produced pulse song, while sine song was produced transiently after stimulus offset

408

(Fig. 5A, Movie S7), and the amount of pulse song produced scaled with the strength of

409

activation (Fig. 5B-C). The evoked pulse and sine songs were virtually indistinguishable from

410

natural song (Fig. S6C, D). In Drosophila, retinal (the channelrhodopsin cofactor) must be

411

supplied via feeding, and red light stimulation drove singing significantly more in males fed

412

with retinal versus those fed regular food (Fig. S6E). Activation of a control line that only

413

labels pCd neurons (Zhou et al., 2014) did not drive singing (Fig. S6E), implying that song

414

production results from the activation of the pC2 neurons in our driver. Importantly, we never

415

observed song production upon pC2 activation in females (Fig. 5D-E) – pC2 neurons thus

416

drive song in a sex-specific manner. These results also establish pC2 neurons as serving a

417

dual sensory and motor role: they respond selectively to the pulse song (Fig. 3C, F) and also

418

bias the song pathway towards producing the same song mode (Fig. 5A, B).

419
420

We next tested whether inactivation of pC2 affected song production during courtship, by

421

constitutively suppressing the synaptic output of pC2 (via expression of TNT (Sweeney et

422

al., 1995)) in males courting wild type virgin females (see Methods). Males with a genetically

423

silenced subset of pC2 neurons still sang, demonstrating that the driver did not label

424

neurons that were required for singing or that other neurons can substitute for the missing

425

activity of pC2 (Clemens et al., 2018a; Philipsborn et al., 2011). The fine structure of the

426

song was wild-type like with normal IPIs, pulse shapes, and carrier frequencies (Fig. S6F, G)

427

and copulation rates were normal (Fig. S6H). Surprisingly, pC2l-silenced males sang about

428

twice as much as the controls, and this effect was largely driven by the production of more

429

sine song (Fig. 5F). Given that pC2 activation yielded virtually no sine song during

430

optogenetic stimulation (Fig. 5A, B), this suggests that pC2 inhibits sine song production

431

during natural courtship and generally demonstrates that song production in Drosophila

432

involves a complex control scheme (see also (Clemens et al., 2018a; Philipsborn et al.,

433

2011; Shirangi et al., 2013)).

434
435

The genetic manipulations so far demonstrate that pC2 can drive behavior in a sex-specific

436

manner – driving song only in males. FLyTRAP also revealed pC2 sex-specific locomotor

437

responses. In the wild type strain NM91, these responses were similarly tuned but of

438

opposite sign in both sexes (Fig. 1, 2). Although the behavioral tuning differed for other

439

strains, the locomotor responses to song were still sex-specific (Fig. S2A). To test whether

440

pC2 activation can produce sex-specific locomotor responses, we placed flies in the

441

FLyTRAP assay and used red light for activation (instead of sound). Given the genotype

442

dependence of the locomotor tuning, we expressed csChrimson in pC2 using two different

443

genotypes. Both carried the same transgenes for expressing csChrimson in pC2 neurons,

444

but one carried half of its chromosomes from the NM91 wild type strain – these genotypes

445

are called “pC2l-csChrimson” and “pC2l-csChrimson/NM91” (see Methods). Both strains

446

produced song upon optogenetic activation in males but not in females (Fig. 5A-E, S6I, J). In

447

FLyTRAP, these strains produced different but nonetheless sex-specific locomotor

448

responses for IPI stimuli (Fig. S2A), allowing us to test whether locomotor responses evoked

449

by pC2 activation are robustly sex-specific despite genotype-specific locomotor tuning. To

450

account for innate visual responses to the light stimulus, we subtracted the responses of

451

normally fed flies from retinal fed flies (Fig. S6K, L).

452
453

For both strains, optogenetic activation of pC2 yielded sex-specific locomotor responses. For

454

pC2l-csChrimson, we observed complex, multiphasic locomotor dynamics, with males

455

tending to slow down and females tending to speed up with increasing optogenetic activation

456

(Fig. 5G, H). For pC2l-csChrimson/NM91, we observed simpler, bi-phasic responses –

457

females first sped up during activation and slowed down after, while males sped up for a

458

short period after stimulation onset only (Fig. 5J). For this genotype, responses differed little

459

across activation levels (Fig. 5K). Importantly, locomotor responses were sex-specific in both

460

genotypes, which we confirmed using principal component analysis (PCA) of the speed

461

traces of males and females (Fig. 5I, L). The first two principal components were sufficient to

462

explain 80% and 99% of the variance in the speed traces, and the responses occupy non-

463

overlapping regions in the principal component space. However, pC2 activation in neither

464

strain reproduced the responses to pulse trains of varying IPI (for the same strain) in

465

FlyTRAP (cf. Fig. S2A). This could be because optogenetic activation does not recapitulate

466

brain dynamics evoked by song – either because the pC2 activation levels were not

467

matched or because song activates multiple circuits that all affect the locomotor responses

468

(Jazayeri and Afraz, 2017). While these issues have to be addressed to fully understand

469

how the responses to playback of song are driven, the results show that pC2 is one of serval

470

elements that contribute to the locomotor tuning for song.

471
472

Finally, we used the pC2l-csChrimson driver to constitutively suppress the synaptic output of

473

pC2 (via expression of TNT (Sweeney et al., 1995)) in females and paired them with wild

474

type virgin males (see Methods). We quantified female song responses as the correlation

475

between different song features and female speed (Clemens et al., 2015; Coen et al., 2014)

476

(Fig. 5M-O). Because male song is structured via sensory feedback cues from the female

477

(Coen et al., 2014), silencing pC2 neurons in females could affect the content of male song

478

– however, the statistics of male song were unchanged by the female manipulation (Fig.

479

S6M, N). pC2 inactivation specifically affected the correlation between female speed and the

480

pulse song IPI, which changed from ~0 to +0.3 (Fig. 5M-O). While control – and wild type

481

(Clemens et al., 2015) – females do not change their speed relative to the range of natural

482

IPIs produced by conspecific males (Fig. 1), females with pC2 neurons silenced accelerate

483

more with increasing IPI. pC2 neurons are therefore required for the normal response to

484

pulse song. The remaining responses to pulse could be caused by pC2 neurons not silenced

485

by our genetic driver or by other neurons tuned for longer IPIs (Zhou et al., 2015). While

486

female locomotor responses to courtship song were affected by pC2 inactivation, copulation

487

rates were not significantly reduced (Fig. S6O), consistent with previous studies (Zhou et al.,

488

2014). In conjunction with the match between behavioral tuning and pC2 tuning, these

489

results add to the evidence that pC2 neurons detect pulse song and play a critical role at the

490

sensorimotor interface – they relay information about pulse song to sex-specific downstream

491

circuits that control either singing or locomotion, and thereby contribute to acoustic

492

communication behaviors.

493
494

Auditory responses of pC2 are modulated by social experience

495

Many sexual behaviors change with social experience (Keleman et al., 2012; Li et al., 2018;

496

Marlin et al., 2015; Remedios et al., 2017). This plasticity could be mediated by modulating

497

the selectivity and the gain of the neurons that detect social cues or of the neurons that drive

498

the behaviors. Social experience is also known to affect courtship behavior in Drosophila

499

(Ellis and Kessler, 1975; Kohatsu and Yamamoto, 2015; F. Von Schilcher, 1976). In

500

particular, a recent study has shown that group housing sharpens the IPI selectivity of the

501

female mating decision and of the male chaining response, and that this effect is mediated

502

by the exposure of song from other flies in the group (Li et al., 2018). However, we do not

503

yet know which elements in the pathway from song to behavior are affected by social

504

experience. Given that pC2 contributes to behavioral responses to song, we asked whether

505

its activity is modulated by housing conditions. The behavioral results presented so far were

506

obtained from group-housed flies so we also ran single-housed males or females to confirm

507

that locomotor responses in FLyTRAP are modulated by social experience. We found that

508

single-housed males responded with little selectivity to pulse trains with different IPIs (Fig.
16

509

6A). This is consistent with the previous study (Li et al., 2018), since group-housed males

510

are exposed to the song of other males during rearing. That we can reproduce these results

511

in a single-fly assay shows that acoustic cues are sufficient to express the effect – previous

512

experiments had used multi-fly assays, leaving open the possibility of other cues being

513

required – e.g. social experience could also affect the song selectivity by altering the

514

pheromonal modulation of acoustic responses. By contrast, females do not sing to other

515

females and accordingly, their locomotor responses are unaffected by the housing condition.

516

Consistent with the behavior, calcium responses in pC2 (measured via the LJ) (Fig. 4F-H)

517

do not change strongly with housing conditions in females but become more selective for IPI

518

in group-housed males (Fig. 6B, C). Notably, sine song responses and responses to pulse

519

trains with different durations are not affected by housing conditions (Fig. S7). This suggests

520

that pC2 could mediate the effect of social experience on the behavioral responses to song.

521
522

Discussion

523

Using a quantitative behavioral assay, we characterized locomotor responses in both males

524

and females to the features that define the Drosophila melanogaster courtship song. Males

525

and females of the wild type strain NM91 showed similar tuning for pulse song stimuli, but

526

nonetheless produced distinct responses (males accelerate while females decelerate; males

527

sing while females do not) (Fig. 1, 2). For both males and females and across multiple

528

timescales, tuning was matched to the distribution of each parameter in the male’s pulse

529

song. We then identified Dsx+ pC2 neurons in the brain that respond selectively to all

530

features of pulse song stimuli, and whose tuning is matched to behavioral tuning (Fig. 3, 4).

531

The activation of pC2 neurons elicited sex-specific behavioral responses to pulse song (Fig.

532

5), and social experience sharpened both behavioral feature selectivity and pC2 tuning (Fig.

533

6). We thus conclude that Dsx+ pC2 neurons connect song detection with the execution of

534

sex-specific behaviors.

535
536

Matches between behavioral tuning and conspecific song

537

Behavioral selectivity for species-specific signals is thought to serve species separation. In

538

FLyTRAP, locomotor tuning in NM91 and Dsx/GCaMP females overlaps with the conspecific

539

song – these females slow to conspecific song (Fig. 2A) and do not change their speed or

540

may even accelerate for deviant pulse parameters (Fig. S3A, E). However, the tuning for any

541

single song feature is not sufficiently narrow to serve as an effective filter for conspecific

542

song. For instance, NM91 and Dsx/GCaMP females also slow for IPIs produced by a sibling

species D. simulans (50-65 ms) (Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1969). However, D. simulans

544

pulses would be rejected based on a mismatch in other song features – D. simulans pulses

545

are too short and of too high frequency to be accepted by females (Clemens et al., 2017;

546

Riabinina et al., 2011). Selectivity for multiple song features may thus enable species

547

discrimination with relatively broad single-feature tuning (Amézquita et al., 2011). Males and

548

females are exposed to additional non-acoustic cues during courtship that may further

549

sharpen behavioral tuning. For instance, chemical cues prevent males from courting

550

heterospecific females (Fan et al., 2013) and likely also contribute to female rejection

551

(Billeter et al., 2009; Rybak et al., 2002b) – it will be interesting to explore how non-auditory

552

cues (Keleman et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2016) modulate locomotor responses to song and

553

whether multi-modal integration occurs in pC2 neurons or elsewhere. The absence of non-

554

acoustic cues may explain the diversity of locomotor responses across strains in the

555

FLyTRAP assay (Fig. S2). Using a naturalistic courtship assay, previous studies show that

556

the same strains as the ones tested in FlyTRAP exhibit similar behaviors – males pattern

557

their song in response to the female behavior and females change their locomotor speed to

558

the natural courtship song similarly across all strains (Clemens et al., 2017; 2015; Coen et

559

al., 2016; 2014).

560
561

In contrast to pulse song responses, the locomotor and singing responses for sine song in

562

FLyTRAP were less sex-specific (Fig. 2E) and the behavioral tuning did not match well the

563

conspecific song – very low frequencies never produced by males slowed NM91 females the

564

most (Fig. 2A, B). This implies divergent roles for the two song modes and is consistent with

565

previous studies (Eberl et al., 1997; F. V. Schilcher, 1976) – for instance sine song does not

566

induce male-male courtship (Yoon et al., 2013). It has been suggested that pulse song may

567

modulate sine song responses (F. V. Schilcher, 1976) but we did not detect strong serial

568

interactions between the two song modes (Fig. S3G). Alternatively, responses to sine song

569

may depend more strongly on the presence of male chemical cues (Billeter et al., 2009;

570

Kurtovic et al., 2007) that are absent in the FLyTRAP assay. This is consistent with sine

571

song being produced when the male is near the female (Coen et al., 2014) – that is, when

572

these chemical cues are particularly strong.

573
574

Pathways for detecting sine and pulse

575

Our behavioral and neuronal results suggest that pulse and sine song are processed in

576

parallel pathways (Fig. 2E, 3C, F-H) but it is unclear as of yet how and where sounds are

577

split into different streams. Sine and pulse can be separated based on spectral and temporal

578

properties (Fig. S5). In fact, the frequency tuning in auditory receptor neurons (JON) and

579

first-order auditory brain neurons (AMMC) may already be sufficient to separate the lower-

580

frequency sine (150 Hz) from the higher-frequency pulse (>220 Hz) (Azevedo and Wilson,

581

2017; Ishikawa et al., 2017; Kamikouchi et al., 2009; Patella and Wilson, 2018; Yorozu et al.,

582

2009). Temporal pattern could further discriminate pulse from sine by either suppressing

583

responses to the sustained sine via adaptation or by tuning temporal integration such that

584

the brief pulse stimuli fail to drive neuronal spiking. A complete mapping of auditory

585

pathways and auditory activity throughout the Drosophila brain is required to identify where

586

and how the neural selectivity for the different song modes arises.

587
588

Here, we have identified pC2 as one of the pathways driving responses to pulse song – pC2

589

tuning matches the behavioral tuning for pulse song (Fig. 3H, I), pC2 activation drives sex-

590

specific responses to song (Fig. 5), and experience-dependent modulation of pC2 tuning

591

matches the behavioral tuning (Fig. 6). Importantly, our data also indicate that pC2 neurons

592

are not the only neurons used to detect pulse song, since the variability of pC2 neurons

593

across stimuli and individuals does not account for the full behavioral variability (Fig. 3H, I,

594

Fig. 4I-K). Interestingly, previous studies have implied pC1 as a pulse song detector (Zhou

595

et al., 2015; 2014). Like pC2, pC1 exists in males and females (Rideout et al., 2010), and

596

activation drives several courtship-related behaviors in males – including singing, male-male

597

courtship, and aggression (Koganezawa et al., 2016; Kohatsu et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2012;

598

Philipsborn et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2015) – and also in females (Li et al., 2018; Rezával et

599

al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2014). All previous studies have relied on imaging activity in the lateral

600

junction (LJ) to show that pC1 preferentially responds to pulse song (Zhou et al., 2015;

601

2014). However, we show here that calcium responses of Dsx+ neurons in the LJ reflect the

602

auditory activity of multiple Dsx+ cell types – and we detected auditory responses in the

603

somas of pC2, pC1 (only in females) and pMN2 (a female only neuron) (Fig. 4). Because the

604

number of auditory neurons within the pC2 cluster is much larger than for pC1 or pMN2 (Fig.

605

4C), and because tuning in pC2 somas matches the tuning in the LJ (Fig. 4E-H), we

606

conclude that the LJ activity largely reflects pC2 responses. Nonetheless, we have not

607

exhaustively assessed the match between the neuronal responses of female pC1 and pMN2

608

neurons and behavior. Those neurons may also be critical for the female’s response to pulse

609

song, including behaviors not investigated here (such as oviposition (Kimura et al., 2015)).

611

Inputs and outputs of pC2 neurons

612

pC2 neurons bind different properties of the pulse song to selectively signal the presence of

613

conspecific pulse song – pC2 is tuned to several features of pulse song like pulse carrier

614

frequency, pulse duration, and inter-pulse interval and a match in only one feature is not

615

sufficient to strongly drive these neurons (Fig. 3, S4C-E). How this selectivity arises is as of

616

yet unclear since systematic studies of tuning for multiple pulse song features in the early

617

auditory pathway are missing. However, existing evidence suggests that pC2 may acquire

618

its feature selectivity in a serial manner – via a cumulative sharpening of tuning for song

619

features at successive stages of auditory processing (Kamikouchi et al., 2009; Yamada et

620

al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2015; 2014). Auditory receptor neurons display diverse and specific

621

band-pass tuning for carrier frequency (Ishikawa et al., 2017; Kamikouchi et al., 2009;

622

Patella and Wilson, 2018; Yorozu et al., 2009) and first order auditory B1 neurons further

623

sharpen frequency tuning via resonant conductances (Azevedo and Wilson, 2017). Likewise,

624

peripheral responses are already weakly tuned for IPI (Clemens et al., 2018b; Ishikawa et

625

al., 2017) and this tuning is further sharpened in downstream neurons (Vaughan et al., 2014;

626

Zhou et al., 2015) through the interplay of excitation and inhibition (Yamada et al., 2018).

627

This serial sharpening is similar to how selectivity for pulse song arises in crickets, in which

628

a delay-line and coincidence detector mechanism produces broad selectivity for pulse

629

duration and pulse pause which is subsequently sharpened in a downstream neuron

630

(Schöneich et al., 2015). More direct readouts of the membrane voltage of auditory neurons

631

in the fly brain are required to determine the biophysical mechanisms that generate song

632

selectivity in pC2.

633
634

Similarly, the circuits downstream of pC2 neurons that control the diverse and sex-specific

635

behaviors reported here remain to be identified. Our assessment of inter-individual variability

636

in IPI preference revealed that most of the behavioral variability does not arise at the level of

637

pC2 neurons (Fig. 4K). This suggests that variability in parallel or in downstream pathways

638

strongly contributes to the locomotor tuning – pC2 activity is only one of multiple

639

determinants of the behavior. This is consistent with optogenetic activation of pC2 being

640

insufficient to produce the song-induced locomotor dynamics (Fig. S3, 5G,J). Still, our

641

results demonstrate that pC2 drives sex-specific downstream circuits. pC2 neurons may

642

connect directly with descending interneurons (DNs) (Cande et al., 2017; Namiki et al.,

643

2017) that control motor behaviors. For example, pC2 activation in males drives pulse song

644

production, followed by sine song production at stimulus offset (Fig. 5A). This behavior

645

resembles that caused by pIP10 activation (Clemens et al., 2018a) – pIP10 is a male-only

646

descending neuron (Philipsborn et al., 2011), but we don’t yet know if it directly connects

647

with pC2 neurons. The fact that song responses are bi-directional – pulse song can induce

648

both slowing and acceleration within each sex (Fig. 2A, B, S3) – implies that the sex-

649

specificity of motor control is more than a simple re-routing from accelerating DNs in males

650

to slowing DNs in females. Notably, song also promotes copulation, but we did not detect a

651

significant effect of pC2 inactivation on copulation rates (Fig. S6O). This could be because

652

our driver only labeled 1/3 of the auditory pC2 neurons or because pC2 activity does not

653

inform the decision to mate. That is, parallel pathways may control song responses on

654

different timescales: one pathway accumulates song information over timescales of minutes

655

(Clemens et al., 2015; Ratcliff et al., 2016) and ultimately controls the mating decision;

656

another, independent pathway controls behavioral responses to song on sub-second

657

timescales, such as dynamic adjustments in locomotion and the production of courtship

658

song.

659
660

Modularity facilitates plasticity of behavioral responses to song

661

Our behavioral data suggest that some aspects of the sex-specificity of behavior arises after

662

feature tuning. The pC2 neurons are selective for pulse song in both sexes (Fig. 3, 4) and

663

drive locomotor responses with sex-specific dynamics or singing in males (Fig. 5). This is

664

reminiscent of how sex-specific behaviors are driven to the male pheromone cVA in flies:

665

shared detector neurons – olfactory receptor neurons and projection neurons in the antennal

666

lobe – detect cVA in both sexes, and this information is then routed to sex-specific higher-

667

order neurons in the lateral horn, which are thought to drive the different behaviors (Datta et

668

al., 2008; Kohl et al., 2013; Ruta et al., 2010). This modular architecture with detectors of

669

social signals being flexibly routed to different behavioral outputs is beneficial if these routes

670

are plastic. For instance, here we show that social experience can shape male responses to

671

song (similar to (Li et al., 2018)), along with tuning at the level of the neurons that detect the

672

song (Fig. 6). During mating, males transfer a sex peptide to females (Yapici et al., 2008)

673

that alters female behavioral responses to song from slowing to acceleration (Coen et al.,

674

2014) – these effects may be mediated at the level of the motor circuits downstream of pC2,

675

shifting pulse song responses in females to resemble those of males. Modularity also

676

facilitates behavioral plasticity on evolutionary time scales since only one element – the

677

feature detector – needs to change for behavioral tuning in both sexes to adapt to new

678

songs that evolve during speciation (Capranica et al., 1973; Kostarakos et al., 2009). The

679

identification of pC2 neurons as pulse song detectors is therefore likely to benefit future

680

studies of the evolution of song recognition.

681
682

pC2 neurons have a dual sensory and motor role

683

Unlike regular higher-order sensory neurons, which detect a sensory cue to drive different

684

behaviors, pC2 neurons detect the cue whose production they drive (Fig. 3F, G, 5A-C). Such

685

a dual sensory and motor role may guide social interactions and communication via

686

imitation. In Drosophila melanogaster, hearing the song of other males induces a male to

687

court and sing to other females and even males (Eberl et al., 1997; Yoon et al., 2013). This

688

behavior may have originated because the song of another male indicates the presence of a

689

female nearby.

690
691

Neurons with a dual sensory and motor roles are well-known from vertebrates (Mooney,

692

2014; Prather et al., 2008; Rizzolatti and Fogassi, 2014). For instance, “mirror” neurons are

693

active during the production as well as the observation of a behavior and are thought to be

694

crucial for imitation learning and communication between conspecifics (Rizzolatti and Arbib,

695

1998). Neurons with a sensorimotor correspondence in the brain of song birds are active

696

during singing and hearing song, and these neurons are hypothesized to play a role in song

697

learning (Mooney, 2014). Importantly, pC2 differs crucially from these instances in that it

698

directly drives the production of the acoustic signal it detects (Fig. 5A-C). Because we

699

recorded pC2 activity in passively listening males, we do not yet know whether pC2 is

700

activated by sound in an actively singing male. If so, hearing its own song could induce self-

701

stimulation and form a positive feedback loop to maintain courtship behavior by mediating

702

persistent behavioral state-changes (Hoopfer et al., 2016). Alternatively, auditory inputs

703

could be suppressed during singing via a corollary discharge (Poulet and Hedwig, 2003;

704

Schneider et al., 2014), which would allow pC2 to maintain sensitivity to the song of other

705

males to coordinate inter-male competition during singing. Additional studies of pC2 activity

706

in behaving animals are required to fully understand how these pulse song detector neurons

707

integrate into the acoustic communication behavior.

708
709

In summary, we show how the circuits that recognize song to drive diverse and sex-specific

710

behavioral responses are organized in Drosophila: common detector neurons – pC2 –

711

recognize pulse song in both males and females, and this identically processed information

712

is then routed to drive multiple sex-specific behaviors. Similar principles may underlie the

Figure 1 – FLyTRAP assay for comparing locomotor tuning for courtship song stimuli in
males and females.
A Drosophila melanogaster produces song in bouts that can consist of two modes: Sine song
corresponds to a weakly amplitude modulated oscillation with a species-specific carrier
frequency (~150Hz) and pulse song corresponds to trains of Gabor-like wavelets each with a
carrier frequency between 220 and 450Hz and a duration between 6 and 12 ms. These pulses
are produced at an inter-pulse interval (IPI) of 30-45 ms.
B FLyTRAP consists of behavioral chamber that is placed in front of a speaker through which
sound is presented. Fly movement is tracked using a camera. Shown is a single video frame of
females in the assay with fly tracks for the preceding 20 seconds overlaid in magenta. See
Movie S1.
C Locomotor responses of females (magenta) and males (grey) for pulse trains with different
IPIs (see legend). The gray shaded box indicates the duration of the sound stimulus. Red traces
at the bottom of the plot show short snippets of the 5 IPI stimuli presented in this experiment.
Baseline speed was subtracted before trial averaging.
D Speed tuning curves for different IPIs in females (magenta) and males (grey) are obtained by
averaging the speed traces in the six seconds following stimulus onset. The histograms at
bottom shows the IPI distribution found in male song (data from 47 males of NM91 wild type
strain totaling 82643 pulses).
Lines and shaded areas or error bars in C and D correspond to the mean ± s.e.m. across 112
male and 112 female flies.
All Δspeed values from the wild type strain NM91.
See also Figure S1 and Movie S1.

Figure 2

Figure 2 – Responses to song playback are sex-specific and tuned for multiple features
of pulse and sine song.
A, B Locomotor tuning curves for females (A, magenta) and males (B, grey) for 6 different
features of pulse and sine song. Lines and error bars correspond to the mean±s.e.m. across
flies (see Table S1 for a description of all stimuli and N flies).
C Distribution of the six different song features tested in A, B in the natural courtship song of
Drosophila melanogaster males (data from 47 males of NM91 wild type strain totaling 82643
pulses and 51 minutes of sine song from 5269 song bouts). Histograms are normalized to a
maximum of 1.0.
D Pictograms (not to scale) illustrating each song feature examined in A-C. Pulse and sine song
features are marked red and blue, respectively.
E Changes in speed for males and females for all pulse (red) and sine (blue) stimuli tested (data
from A, B, S3, see Table S1). Responses to sine stimuli are strongly and positively correlated
between sexes (r=0.89, p=6x10-8). Pulse responses are also strongly but negatively correlated
(r=-0.63, p=5x10-10). Blue and red lines correspond to linear fits to the responses to sine and
pulse song, respectively.
F Fraction of trials for which male and female flies extended their wings during the playback of
pulse song (five different IPIs as in 1C, D) and sine song (150Hz, quantified only for males).
Solitary males (grey) frequently extend their wings in response to pulse but not to sine song.
Solitary females (magenta) do not extend wings for pulse song. See also Movie S2.
G Fraction of trials that evoke wing extension in males (grey) and females (magenta) as a
function of IPI. In males, wing extension and locomotor behavior (Figure 1D) exhibit strikingly
similar tuning with a peak at the conspecific IPI. Females almost never extend their wing for any
IPI.
All behavioral data from the wild type strain NM91. All correlation values are Spearman’s rank
correlation.

Figure 3 – Neuronal tuning of Dsx+ neurons in the LJ matches behavioral tuning for
pulse stimuli in males and females.
A Anatomy of Dsx+ neurons in the female brain. Max z-projection of a confocal stack of a fly
brain in which all Dsx+ are labeled with GFP. 5/8 cell types (pC1, pC2l (yellow), pC2m (blue),
pMN1, pMN2) project to the lateral junction (LJ), while 3 cell types (pCd1, pCd2, aDN (movie
S11)) do not. Yellow and blue arrows point to the neurites that connect pC2l and pC2m to the
LJ. See also Fig. S5B, C.
B Grayscale image (see color bar) of calcium responses (ΔF/F) to a pulse train (IPI 36ms) in an
ROI centered around the LJ (red) and the pC2l neurites (yellow) in a female. Shown are
snapshots of the recording at three different time points relative to stimulus onset - before (T=10s), during (T=1.2s), and after (T=20s) the stimulus. Flies express GCaMP6m in all Dsx+ cells.
Conspecific pulse song elicits strong increases in fluorescence in the LJ and the pC2 neurites.
C LJ responses to sine (blue) and pulses (red) stimuli in females (left) and males (right).
Individual dots correspond to integral ΔF/F responses for individual stimuli averaged over the 312 individuals tested for each stimulus. Many pulse stimuli evoke much stronger responses than
the most effective sine stimulus (p=8x10-11 for females and p=2x10-11 for males, two-sided rank
sum comparison of sine and pulse responses).
D Comparison of male and female LJ responses to sine (blue) and pulse (red) stimuli.
Responses to both song modes are correlated strongly for pulse (r=0.85, p=1x10-14) and
moderately for sine (r=0.48, p=0.007) stimuli. Individual dots correspond to the integral ΔF/F for
individual stimuli averaged across animals. Before averaging, the responses of each animal
were normalized to compensate for inter-individual differences in calcium levels (see methods
for details).
E Fluorescence traces from the LJ in females (top, magenta) and males (bottom, grey) for pulse
trains with three different IPIs (see legend, average over 6 individuals for each sex). In both
sexes, the LJ responds most strongly to the conspecific IPI of 36ms (Fig. 1D). Responses are
much weaker for shorter (16ms) and longer (76ms) IPIs. Calcium responses in the LJ are
smaller in males than in females (compare C). See also Supp. Movie S3, S4.
F Tuning curves of calcium responses in the female (magenta) and the male (gray) LJ for
features of pulse and sine song (compare to behavioral tuning in Fig. 2A, B). Lines and error
bars correspond to the mean±s.e.m. across flies. Integral ΔF/F normalized as in D.
G pC2 calcium responses to the conspecific pulse song (left), pulse song stimuli with a
mismatch in a single feature (right) in males (grey) and females (magenta). A single mismatch
reduces neuronal responses by at least 20% and up to 80%, indicating the high, multi-feature
selectivity of pC2 in both sexes. The conspecific pulse song is shown as a reference (pulse
duration 12ms, pulse pause 24ms, pulse carrier frequency 250Hz, 112 pulses). Mismatch
stimuli differed only in a single parameter from the reference (shortest pause: 4 ms, longest
pause: 84 ms; shortest pulse: 4ms, longest pulse: 60ms, lowest frequency: 100Hz, highest
frequency: 800Hz).
H, I Comparison of behavioral and neuronal tuning in males (H) and females (I). Behavioral and
neuronal data from flies of the same genotype (Dsx/GCaMP). We obtained similar results when
comparing the neuronal responses to behavioral data from wild type flies (NM91, Fig. S4H-I).

Dots correspond to the Δspeed and the normalized integral ΔF/F averaged over individuals,
lines indicate linear fits. In males (H), behavioral and neuronal responses are positively
correlated for pulse (red, r=0.61, p=1x10-5) but not for sine stimuli (blue, r=0.17, p=0.49). In
females (I), behavioral and neuronal responses are negatively correlated for pulse (red, r=-0.53,
p=3x10-4 but not for sine stimuli (blue, r=0.28, p=0.25).
All Δspeed and ΔF/F values are from Dsx/GCaMP flies. Panel K additionally shows behavioral
data from the wild type strain NM91. All correlation values are Spearman’s rank correlation.
See also Figure S4, and Movie S3 and S4.
Figure 4

Figure 4 – pC2 neurons are pulse song detectors common to both sexes.
A Individual Dsx+ neuron types (black) with somas in the female central brain in which we
detected calcium responses for pulse or sine song, registered to a common template brain
(gray) (see Methods for details). Of the 8 Dsx+ cell types in the central brain, pC2l, pC2m, the
single female-only neuron pMN2 and a small number of pC1 neurons (and only in some
individuals) respond to courtship sounds. The lateral junction (LJ) is marked in magenta and
somata are marked with golden arrow heads. See also Supp. Movie S10, S11.
B Example somatic fluorescence traces from single somata of the pC1, pC2, and pMN2 cells in
response to pulse trains (IPI=36ms, single trial responses). Fluorescence trace from the LJ
(magenta) shown for comparison. The gray box marks the duration of the sound stimulus. In
each panel. Horizontal and vertical scale bars correspond to 6 seconds and 0.25 ΔF/F,
respectively. Horizontal black line marks ΔF/F=0.
C Fraction of cells in Dsx+ clusters with detectable somatic calcium responses to pulse or sine
song (females, light grey dots; males, dark grey squares). Complete clusters were imaged using
volumetric scan for pC1, pC2 and single plane scans for pMN2. We did not distinguish between
pC2l/m, since in most flies both groups are spatially intermingled at the level of cell bodies. Note
that all flies included showed calcium responses to sound in the LJ, even when we did not
detect responses in specific somata.
D Peak somatic ΔF/F for pulse (red, 36ms IPI), sine (blue, 150Hz), and noise (orange, 100900Hz). Lines connect responses recorded in the same animal. Note that responses are plotted
on a log scale – the average of the ratio between sine and pulse for all cells is ~2.6. 36/38 pC2,
4/5 pC1 and 2/2 pMN2 prefer pulse over sine. See also Supp. Movie S5, S6.
E High resolution confocal scan of a single pC2l neuron (obtained via a stochastic labelling
technique, see Methods for details). Only the side ipsilateral to the cell body is shown. The
neurites in the lateral junction appear varicose, indicating that they contain pre-synaptic sites.
F Normalized integral ΔF/F values recorded simultaneously in the LJ and the neurites that
connect the LJ with the somata of pC2l (and no other Dsx+ cell type) are highly correlated in
females (magenta, r=0.99, p=1x10-71, N=10-24 flies/stimulus) and males (grey, r=0.75, p=4x1013, N=1-6 flies/stimulus). Each point corresponds to an individual stimulus (pulse or sine)
averaged over flies. The high correlation indicates that calcium responses in the LJ reflect
responses in pC2l neurons. Magenta and gray lines in F-H correspond to a least-squares fit to
the individual data points.
G Normalized integral ΔF/F recorded first in the LJ and then in single pC2l somata in the same
fly are highly correlated in both sexes (females: r=0.86, p=8x10-10, N=8 flies/stimulus, males:
r=0.73, p=4x10-6, N=1 fly/stimulus), demonstrating that calcium responses in the LJ represent
the responses of individual pC2l cells, with some variability across individual cells and animals.
H Normalized integral ΔF/F responses from the pC2l neurites and from single pC2l somata in
different flies are highly correlated in both sexes (females: r=0.89, p=2x10-11, N=8 flies/stimulus,
males: r=0.79, p=1x10-7, N=1 fly/stimulus). The pC2l neurites reflect the average activity of
individual pC2l neurons, with some variability across individual cells and animals.
I, J Comparison of calcium responses in the pC2l neurites and male (I) or female (J) speed for
the same stimuli. Calcium and speed data come from flies of the same genotype (Dsx/GCaMP).

Similar results were obtained when using speed data from wild type flies (NM91) instead (Fig.
S5G-H). pC2l and behavioral responses are highly correlated for pulse with a sex-specific sign
(female (I): pulse: r=-0.49, p=1x10-3, sine: r=-0.09, p=0.73; male (J): pulse: r=0.70, p=5x10-4,
sine: r=-0.20, p=0.78), just as for the LJ (compare Fig. 3I). The match between neuronal and
behavioral tuning for pulse song indicates that pC2l neurons detect the pulse song. Each point
corresponds to an individual stimulus (Δspeed: N~100 flies per stimulus, ΔF/F: N=10-24 female
and 1-6 male flies/stimulus).
K Comparison across individuals of most frequent IPIs in male song (n= 75528 pulses from 27
males) and preferred IPIs in the female LJ (integral ΔF/F; n = 11 females) and behavior
(Δspeed; n = 112 females NM91 and 92 females Dsx/GCaMP). Song and speed are shown for
NM91 (blue), LJ and speed are shown for Dsx/GCaMP (orange). While all males produce songs
with IPIs around 36ms, female neuronal and behavioral tuning for IPI is much more variable
(standard deviations: 2.4ms for male song, 14ms for female ΔF/F (for integral ΔF/F (shown),
7ms for peak ΔF/F), 23 and 27ms for the speed of NM91 and Dsx/GCaMP females,
respectively). Notably, variability in female speed is larger than in the female LJ, indicating that
pathways parallel to or downstream of the LJ contribute to the behavior.
All Δspeed and ΔF/F values are from flies expressing GCaMP6m under the control of Dsx-Gal4.
All correlation values are Spearman’s rank correlation. See also Figure S5 and Movie S5 and
S6.

Figure 5

Figure 5 – Testing the necessity and sufficiency of pC2 neurons for song and locomotor
behaviors.
A Song evoked in males by optogenetic activation (627nm LEDs, intensity 13 mW/cm2) of a
driver line that labels pC2l and pCd neurons (R42B01∩Dsx, refered to as pC2l-csChrimson).
Top trace shows a song recording marking pulse and sine song in red and blue, respectively.
The grey area indicates the duration (4 seconds) of optogenetic activation. Pulse song is
evoked during activation while sine song occurs immediately following activation. Bottom plots
show pulse rate (red) and sine song probability (blue) averaged over 7 flies (18 stimulation
epochs per animals). See also Movie S7. Activation of pC2l using a different genotype (pC2lcsChrimson/NM91) has similar effects (Fig. S6I, J)
B, C Average pulse rate (B) and sine song probability (C) evoked in the 6 seconds following
LED light onset (LED duration is 4 seconds). Dose-response curves for individuals are shown
as thin lines, population averages (mean±s.e.m.) are shown as thick lines with error bars. Pvalues result from two-sided sign tests and are adjusted for multiple comparisons using
Bonferroni’s method. Same data as in A. See also Supp. Movie S7, S8.
D, E Same as B, C but for females (N=3 flies). Activation of pC2l (and pCd) in the female does
not evoke song – pC2l activation drives singing in a sex-specific manner.
F Song of males courting wild type NM91 females. pC2l synaptic output in the males was
inhibited using TNT via the R42B01∩Dsx driver. Dots correspond to the amount of all song
(left), pulse song (middle), and sine song (right) (pC2l TNT (N=24) – orange, pC2l control
(N=25) – blue). Black lines connect the means of the two genotypes. P-values show the
outcome of a two-sided rank sum test. Inhibiting pC2l output leads to more overall singing and
sine song, but not to more pulse song, indicating that pC2l biases singing towards pulse song
during courtship. Other song features are not affected (see Fig. S6F-H).
G, H Optogenetic activation of R42B01∩Dsx using csChrimson (pC2l-csChrimson) evokes
locomotor responses with sex-specific dynamics. Changes in speed (G) and tuning curves (H)
were corrected for intrinsic light responses by subtracting the responses of control flies with the
same genotype that were not fed retinal (see Fig. S6K). Females (top, magenta) slow for weak
and speed for strong activation with multi-phasic dynamics as for sound (H, I, compare D).
Males decrease their speed and responses outlast the optogenetic stimulus (bottom, grey). See
also Supp. Movie S9. See S6K for N flies. The grey area indicates the duration of LED
stimulation (4 seconds).
I Principal component (PC) analysis of male and female locomotor speed traces (12s following
stimulus LED or sound onset, traces taken from G). Shown are first and second principal
component (PC) scores of females (magenta) and males (grey) for sound (squares) and
optogenetic stimulation (circles). Lines correspond to least-square fits for each sex. Female and
male responses to different LED occupy different areas in PC space, indicating that the
locomotor dynamics are sex-specific.
J, K Same as G, H but with a different genotype (pC2l-csChrimson/NM91 – see Methods for
details). Females (top, magenta) speed throughout the stimulation (J) and for all LED intensities
(K). Males (bottom, grey) first speed and then slow for all LED intensities. The evoked locomotor
dynamics differ between genotypes (I) but are always sex-specific.

L Same as I but with the pC2l-csChrimson/NM91 phenotype. Again, male and female locomotor
responses are different, since they occupy different areas in PC space (compare panel I).
M Locomotor tuning for IPI during natural courtship obtained from single females that were
courted by a wild-type NM91 male. pC2l synaptic output in the females was inhibited using TNT
using the R42B01∩Dsx driver. Lines and error bars correspond to the mean±s.e.m speed of N
females per genotype tested (pC2l TNT– orange, pC2l control – blue, N=48 females for each
genotype, see methods for details on how the tuning curves were computed). pC2l control
females (blue) do not change their speed with IPI within the range commonly produced by
males (r=0.02, p=0.59, compare Fig. 1D). pC2l TNT females (orange) accelerate for longer IPIs
(r=0.31, p=3x10-30).
N Rank correlation between female speed and different song features during natural courtship
(pC2l control – blue, pC2l TNT – orange).
O Difference between the rank correlations for control (blue) and pC2l TNT (orange) flies in N.
pC2l inactivation specifically changes the correlation between female speed and IPI (dark gray,
p=6x10-8). All other changes in correlation are much smaller and not significant (p>0.18). Pvalues were obtained by fitting an ANCOVA model (see methods for details) and were corrected
for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method.
All correlation values are Spearman’s rank correlation.
See also Figure S6 and Movie S7.

Figure 6

Figure 6 – Behavorial and pC2 responses are similarly modulated by social experience.
A Changes in speed for pulse trains measured using FLyTRAP with different IPIs in singlehoused (solid line) or group-housed (dashed lines) female (left, magenta) and male flies (right,
grey). Plots show mean ± s.e.m. across 92/116 group-housed and 137/71 single-housed
female/male flies. Female IPI tuning is not strongly affected by housing conditions. By contrast,
males change their speed more selectively when group-housed.
B Calcium responses from the LJ for pulse trains with different IPIs in single-housed (solid line)
or group-housed (dashed lines) female (left, magenta) and male flies (right, grey). Plots show
mean ± s.e.m. across 5-6 female or male flies in each condition. In females, group housing only
weakly suppresses LJ responses for some IPIs. By contrast, male LJ responses are selectively
suppressed for long IPIs, which sharpens the IPI tuning.
C Ratio of Calcium responses to 36 and 56 ms IPIs in single-housed or group-housed female
(left, magenta) and male flies (right, grey). Individual dots correspond to individual flies, the solid
lines connect the population average ratios. P-values were obtained from a two-sided rank sum
test.
All Δspeed and ΔF/F values are from flies expressing GCaMP6m under the control of Dsx-Gal4.

Grey color frames with a resolution of 1280x960 pixels were acquired at 30 frames per second
using custom written software in python and saved as compressed videos. Sound
representation was controlled using custom software written in Matlab. The sound stimuli were
converted to an analog voltage signal using a National Instruments DAQ card (PCIe-6343). The
signal was then amplified by a Samson s-amp headphone amp and used to drive a speaker
(HiVi F6 6-1/2" Bass/Midrange). Sound intensity was calibrated as in (Clemens et al., 2015) by
converting the voltage of a calibrated microphone (placed where the fly chambers would be
during an experiment) to sound intensity and adjusting the sound amplification to match the
target intensity. Sound and video where synchronized by placing into the camera's field-of-view
a 650nm LED whose brightness was controlled using a copy of the sound signal. The chamber
consisted of an array of 12 small arenas (7 by 46 mm, made from red plastic) was placed in
front of the loudspeaker (Movie S1). The arena floor consisted of plastic mesh to let sound into
the chamber and the top was covered with a thin, translucent plastic sheet. Flies were
illuminated using a white LED back light from below and a desk lamp from above.
Playback experiments
Virgin male and female flies were isolated within 6 hours of eclosion and aged for 3-7 days prior
to the experiments. Flies were raised at low density on a 12:12 dark:light cycle, at 25˚C and
60% humidity. Flies were introduced gently into the chamber using an aspirator. Recordings
were performed at 25˚C and timed to start within 60 minutes of the incubator lights switching on
to catch the morning activity peak. Stimulus playback was block-randomized to ensure that all
stimuli within a set occur at the same overall rate throughout the stimulus. The stimulus set (e.g.
five pulse trains with different IPIs, see Supplemental Table 1 for a list of all stimulus sets) was
repeated for the duration of the experiment (2 hours). Stimuli were interleaved by 60 seconds of
silence to reduce crosstalk between responses to subsequent stimulus presentations.
Stimulus design
Sound was generated at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz using custom Matlab scripts. Sine
song stimuli were created as pure tones of the specified frequency and intensity (typically
5mm/s). Pulse song was generated by arranging Gabor wavelets in trains interleaved by a
specified pause. The Gabor wavelets were built by modulating the amplitude of a short
sinusoidal using a Gaussian: exp(-t2/(2σ2)) sin(2πf * t + ϕ), where f is the pulse carrier
frequency, ϕ is the phase of carrier, and σ is proportional to the pulse duration. The parameters
for all stimuli used along with the behavioral responses obtained in FLyTRAP are listed in
Supplemental Table 1.
Analysis of FLyTRAP data
Fly positions where tracked using custom-written software. Briefly, the image background was
estimated as the median of 500 frames spaced to cover the full video. Foreground pixels
(corresponding to the fly body) were identified by thresholding the absolute values of the

difference between each frame and the background estimate. The fly center position was then
taken as the median of the position of all foreground pixels in each chamber. The sequence of
fly positions across video frames was then converted into a time series using the light onset
frames of the synchronization LED (indicating sound onset) as a reference. From the position
time series fly speed was calculated and the speed traces where then aligned to stimulus onset
for each trial. Base line speed was calculated as the average of the speed over an interval
starting 30 seconds and ending 2 seconds before stimulus onset. Test speed was calculated
over an interval starting at stimulus onset and ending 2 seconds after stimulus offset. Tuning
curves were calculated as the difference between baseline speed and test speed for each trial,
averaged over trials for each stimulus and animal. Speed traces were obtained by subtracting
the baseline speed from the trace for each trial and averaging over trials for each stimulus and
animal. All data (tuning curves, speed traces) are presented as mean +/- s.e.m. over flies. Code
for stimulus generation, fly tracking and analysis of the locomotion data is available at
https://github.com/murthylab/flytrapanalyses.
Manual scoring of wing extension in FLyTRAP
To evaluate the number of flies that extend their wings upon playback of pulse or sine song, we
manually scored wing extension in the videos using the VirtualDub software. For pulse song
(see Movie S2), we scored 25 stimuli/fly, choosing trials randomly but ensuring that each IPI
(16/36/56/76/96 ms) was scored 5 times/fly. To avoid bias, the scorer was blind to the IPI
presented to the fly in each trial. A total of 120 male flies and 36 female flies were scored (3000
and 900 single-fly responses total for pulse song). We scored wing extension only when the
wing was extended in the first 1/3 second following stimulus onset, and only when the wings
where not extended during the 1 second before stimulus onset. For sine song (150Hz carrier
frequency), 60 males were scored.
Joint tuning for pulse duration and pulse pause
To visualize locomotor (Fig. S3E, F) and calcium (Fig. S4D,E) responses to pulse trains with
different combinations of pulse duration and pulse pause we generated smooth surface plots
using Matlab’s “scatteredInterpolant” function with the interpolation mode set to “natural”.
The boundaries of the plots were set as follows: Pulse duration of zero corresponds to silence
and the speed values were set to 0 since all speed traces are always base line subtracted. A
pulse pause of zero corresponds to a continuous oscillation and we set the corresponding
speed values to those obtained for a 4 second pure tone with a frequency of 250 Hz.
Measurement of song features from natural song data
The inter-pulse interval (IPI) is given by the interval between the peaks of subsequent pulses in
a pulse train. Pulse trains correspond to continuous sequences of pulses with IPIs smaller than
200ms. Measuring the pulse durations from natural song data is non-trivial since pulses vary in
their shape and can be embedded in background noise. We quantified pulse duration by 1)
calculating the envelope of each pulse using the Hilbert transform, 2) smoothing that envelope
using a Gaussian window with a standard deviation of 2 ms, and 3) taking as the pulse duration
the full width of the smoothed envelope at 20% of the maximum amplitude of the pulse. Pulse

durations for artificial stimuli used in our pulse train were defined to be consistent with this
method. Pulse carrier frequency is given by the center of mass of the amplitude spectrum of
each pulse (Clemens et al., 2017). Sine carrier frequency was calculated as the peak frequency
of the power spectrum of individual sine tones.
PCA of speed traces
For the PCA of sex-specific responses to sound and optogenetic activation of pC2 (Fig. 5L) we
collected male and female speed traces for all IPIs (Fig. 5D, F) and optogenetic activation levels
(Fig. 5H, J) into a large matrix. Each speed trace was cut to include only the 10 seconds after
sound onset and then normalized to have zero mean and unit variance.
Optogenetic experiments
CsChrimson was expressed in pC2 neurons using an intersection between R42B01-Gal4 and
dsx-LexA using two different genotypes (see table, pC2/csChrimson and
pC2/csChrimson/NM91). 655nm light was emitted from a ring of 6 Tri-Star LEDs (LuxeonStar,
SinkPAD-II 20mm Tri-Star Base) in FLyTRAP (Fig. 5D-K). Flies were fed with food that
contained all-trans retinal for a minimum of three days post eclosion. Control flies were raised
on regular fly food after eclosion. LED stimulation lasted four seconds with 60 seconds pause
between stimuli, similar to the temporal pattern used for auditory stimulus delivery in FLyTRAP
(1-5mW/cm2, 100Hz, duty cycle 0.5). Smaller intensities of 0.1-1wW/cm2 were not sufficient to
drive changes in speed in the pC2/csChrimson/NM91 genotype (data not shown). To measure
the amount of song driven by pC2 activation in solitary flies of the pC2/csChrimson and the
pC2/csChrimson/NM91 genotype, we used a chamber whose floor was tiled with 16
microphones to allow recording of the song (Fig. 5A-C, Movie S7; see (Clemens et al., 2017)).
The LED (627nm LEDs, LuxeonStar) was on for four seconds (frequency 25 Hz, duty cycle 0.5)
and off for 60 seconds. For pC2/csChrimson, we tested three different light intensities (1.8, 9,
and 13 mW/cm2) that were presented in 3 blocks of 18 trials. The order of the three blocks (light
intensities) was randomized for each fly. pC2/csChrimson/NM91 was tested with 9mW/cm2 in 10
trials. Fly song was segmented as described previously (Arthur et al., 2013; Coen et al., 2014).
pC2 inactivation in females and males during courtship
Tetanus neurotoxin light chain (TNT) (Sweeney et al., 1995) was used to block synaptic
transmission in pC2 neurons in females and males. 3-7 days old virgin females or males (pC2TNT: UAS>STOP>TNT/LexAop-flp; dsx-LexA/R42B01-Gal4, pC2-control: +/LexAop-flp; dsxLexA/R42B01-Gal4) were paired with wild type flies (NM91) of the opposite sex, in a custombuilt chamber designed to record fly song (∼25 mm diameter, tiled with 16 microphones;
same setup as the one used for measuring optogenetic driven song). Flies were allowed to
interact for 30 minutes, and the percent of flies copulated as a function of time was scored. A
monochrome camera (Point Grey, FL3-U3-13Y3M) was used to record the fly behavior at 60
frames per second. Fly position was tracked offline and song was segmented as previously
described (Arthur et al., 2013; Coen et al., 2014). We then calculated song statistics (e.g.
amount of song or number of pulses per window) and female locomotion (average female

speed) in windows of 60s with 30s overlap (Clemens et al., 2015). For the rank correlations
between male song features and female speed (Fig. 5M-O), we binned the female speed values
into 16 bins with the bin edges chosen such that each bin was populated by an equal amount of
samples (see Fig. 5M) and calculated the rank correlation between the binned female speed
and the average male song feature per bin. Changes in correlation between control and
experimental flies (Fig. 5O) were analyzed using an ANCOVA model with independent slopes
and intercepts. Significance was determined based on the p-value of the interaction term
(model’s genotype by song-feature) after Bonferroni correction.
Calcium imaging
Imaging experiments were performed on a custom built two-photon laser scanning microscope
equipped with 5mm galvanometer mirrors (Cambridge Technology), an electro-optic modulator
(M350-80LA-02 KD*P, Conoptics) to control the laser intensity, a piezoelectric focusing device
(P-725, Physik Instrumente) for volumetric imaging, a Chameleon Ultra II Ti:Sapphire laser
(Coherent) and a water immersion objective (Olympus XLPlan 25X, NA=1.05). The
fluorescence signal collected by the objective was reflected by a dichroic mirror (FF685 Dio2,
Semrock), filtered using a multiphoton short-pass emission filter (FF01-680/sp-25, Semrock),
split by a dichroic mirror (FF555 Dio3, Semrock) into two channels, green (FF02-525/40-25,
Semrock) and red (FF01-593/40-25, Semrock), and detected by GaAsP photo-multiplier tubes
(H10770PA-40, Hamamatsu). Laser power (measured at the sample plane) was restricted to
15 mW. The microscope was controlled in Matlab using ScanImage 5.1 (Vidrio). Single plane
calcium signals (Fig. 3C-I, 4F,G and pMN2 neuron in Fig 4C-E) were scanned at 8.5 Hz
(256X256 pixels). Pixel size was ~0.5μmX0.5μm when imaging the lateral junction or pC2l
process and ~0.25μmX0.25μm when imaging cell bodies in a single plan (Fig 4G and pMN2
in Fig. 4B-D). For volumetric scanning of cell bodies (Figs 4B-D, S5A), volumes were
acquired at 0.5Hz (256*216, 20 planes, voxel size ~ 0.34μm X 0.4μm X 1.5μm), scanning
one group of cells at a time (pC1, pC2, pCd).
After surgery (opening of the head capsule to reveal the brain), flies were placed beneath the
objective and perfusion saline was continuously delivered directly to the meniscus. Sound
playback was controlled using custom written Matlab software (Clemens et al., 2018). The
software also stopped and started the calcium imaging via a TTL pulse sent to ScanImage
(“external hardware trigger” mode), and single frames were synchronized with stimulus by
sensing a copy of the Y-galvo mirror to a National Instruments DAQ card (PCIe-6343) that
controled the stimulus. The sound stimulus was generated at a sampling rate of 10kHz and
sent by the DAQ card through an amplifier (Crown, D-75A) to a set of head phones (Koss,
‘The Plug’). A single ear plug was connected to one side of a plastic tube (outer-inner
diameters 1/8’’-1/16’’) and the outer tube tip was positioned 2 mm away from the fly arista.
Sound intensity was calibrated by measuring the sound intensity 2 mm away from the tube tip
with a pre-calibrated microphone at a range of frequencies (100Hz-800Hz) and the output
signal was corrected according to the measured intensities. The pause between stimulus
representation was 25 seconds. A stimulus set (26-36 stimuli) was presented to each fly in a

block-randomized order as in the playback experiments. Three blocks were presented for
each fly. If the response decayed in the middle of a block (possibly because of drift in the zaxis), the whole block was discarded from the analysis. Typically, two full repetitions per fly
were used for analysis.
Regions of interest (ROIs) for calcium response measurements (in the LJ, pC2 process and in
single Dsx+ somata) were selected manually based on a z-projection of the tdTomato channel.
∆F/F of the GCaMP signal was calculated as (F(t)-F0)/ F0, where F0 is the mean fluorescence in
the ROI in the 10 seconds preceding stimulus onset. Integral ∆F/F (Fig. 3D, F-I) and peak ∆F/F
(Fig. 3F, inset) values were calculated in a window starting at sound stimulus onset and ending
25 seconds after sound stimulus offset. To compensate for differences in overall
responsiveness across flies, we normalized ΔF/F values of each fly by dividing the integral or
peak ∆F/F by the maximal value (of integral or peak ∆F/F) across all stimuli for that fly. For
volumetric scanning (Fig. 4C-D, S5A) pulse song (250Hz, 16 pulse duration, 20 pulse pause),
sine song (250 Hz) and broadband noise (100-900Hz) were presented 6 times each (in the
order pulse-sine-noise, 6 blocks, duration of each stimulus 10 seconds with 20 of silence in
between) for each group of neurons (pC1 or pC2). A cell was considered responsive to a given
stimulus (pulse, sine or broadband noise) if the mean ΔF during the stimulus was higher than
the mean ΔF in the 10 seconds before stimulus onset in 5/6 blocks. Each time series was first
motion corrected using the rigid motion correction algorithm NoRMCorre (Pnevmatikakis and
Giovannucci, 2017) taking the tdTomato signal as the reference image. Then, single cell bodies
were drawn manually, by marking cell boundaries stack by stack. In some cases, mostly with
male pC1 neurons, cell bodies were very packed, such that some ROIs we marked manually
possibly included more than a single cell. The number of single cells reported from Ca imaging
is therefore slightly underestimated.
Light microscopy
Flies expressing GFP in Dsx+ neurons (UAS-eGFP2X; dsx-Gal4; Fig. 3A) and flies expressing
CsChrimson.mVenus in pC2 neurons (R42B01-Gal4 intersected with dsx-LexA; Fig. S6) were
immunostained and scanned in a confocal microscope. 2-4 day old flies were cold-anesthetized
on ice, dissected in cold S2 insect medium (Sigma Aldrich, #S0146) and fixed for 30-40 minutes
on a rotator at room temperature in 4% PFA in 0.3% PBTS (0.3% Triton in PBSX1), followed by
4x15 minutes washes in 0.3% PBTS and 30 minutes in blocking solution (5% normal goat
serum in 0.3%PBTS). Brains were incubated over two nights at 4°C with primary antibody,
washed with 0.3%PBT and incubated for two more nights at 4°C in secondary antibody,
followed by washing (4x15 minutes in 0.3%PBTS and 4x20 minutes in PBS), and mounting with
Vestashield for 2-7 days before imaging. Antibodies were diluted in blocking solution at the
following concentrations: rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen #1828014; used against GFP and mVenus)
1:1000, mouse anti-Bruchpilot (nc82, DSHB AB2314866) 1:20, goat anti-rabbit Alexa Flour 488
(Invitrogen #1853312) 1:200, goat anti-mouse Alexa Flour 633 (Invitrogen #1906490) 1:200.

Stochastic labeling of Dsx+ neurons in the female brain (Fig 4A, E) was done using multi-colorflip-out (MCFO, (Nern et al., 2015)) with three different epitope tags (HA,V5,FLAG). We followed
the JFRC FlyLight Protocol ‘IHC-MCFO’ (https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flylight/protocols)
for the preparation of brains. Flp was induced using R5710C10 promotor-coding sequence
fusions of the flpG5 and flpl. Flies were 4-7 days old when dissected. Flies were stored at 25˚C.
Confocal stacks were acquired with a white light laser confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8 X)
and a Leica objective (HC PL APO 20x/0.75 CS2). A high-resolution scan of a pC2 cell (Fig 4E)
was performed with an oil immersion Leica objective (HC PL APO 63x/1.40 Oil CS2, fig 4E).
Images were registered to the Janelia brain template (JFRC2) (Jenett et al., 2012) using
vfbaligner (http://vfbaligner.inf.ed.ac.uk), which internally uses CMTK for registration (Rohlfing
and Maurer, 2003). The images of the fly brain in Figs 4A and S5D were deposited by G.
Jefferis (Jefferis, 2014). Image processing was performed in FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012)
