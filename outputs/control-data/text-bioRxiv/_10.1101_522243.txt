ABSTRACT

19

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma

20

and is associated with two B cell malignancies, primary effusion lymphoma and the

21

plasmablastic variant of multicentric Castleman’s disease. EphA2 functions as a cellular

22

receptor for the gH/gL glycoprotein complex of KSHV for several adherent cell types. KSHV

23

gH/gL was previously shown to also weakly interact with other members of the Eph family of

24

receptors. Whether these interactions are of functional consequence remained unclear so

25

far, even if other A-type Ephs were shown to be able to compensate for absence of EphA2 in

26

overexpression systems. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that endogenously

27

expressed EphA7 in BJAB B cells is critical for the cell-to-cell transmission of KSHV from

28

producer iSLK cells to BJAB target cells. The BJAB lymphoblastoid cell line often serves as a

29

model for B cell infection and expresses only low levels of all Eph family receptors other than

30

EphA7. Endogenous EphA7 could be precipitated from the cellular lysate of BJAB cells using

31

recombinant gH/gL, and knockout of EphA7 significantly reduced transmission of KSHV into

32

BJAB target cells by over 80%. Finally, we demonstrate that receptor function of EphA7 is

conserved between cell-to-cell transmission of KSHV and cell-free infection by the related

34

rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV), which is relatively even more dependent on EphA7 for

35

infection of BJAB cells.

IMPORTANCE

38

Infection of B cells is biologically relevant for two KSHV-associated malignancies, the

39

plasmablastic variant of multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD) and primary effusion

40

lymphoma (PEL). Elucidating the process of B cell infection is therefore important to

41

understand the pathogenesis of these diseases. For various types of adherent cells, EphA2

42

has been shown by several groups to function as an entry receptor that is engaged by the

43

gH/gL glycoprotein complex. Our previous findings indicate that KSHV does not only interact

44

with EphA2, but can also bind to other members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine

45

kinases with comparatively lower avidity. We now analyzed the requirement of Eph

46

interactions for infection of the BJAB B cell line, a model for infection of B cells by KSHV. We

47

identify EphA7 as the principal Eph receptor for infection of this model B cell line by both

48

KSHV and the related rhesus monkey rhadinovirus.

INTRODUCTION

51

In addition to Kaposi’s sarcoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is

52

associated with a variant of multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD) and with primary

53

effusion lymphoma (PEL) (1). Several publications demonstrate the importance of the

54

cellular receptor EphA2 for KSHV entry into various adherent target cells (2–5). While the

55

KSHV gH/gL complex exhibits the highest avidity for EphA2, it can also interact with other

56

members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs), similar to the gH/gL complex

57

of the related rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) (6). However, so far it was unclear whether

58

these interactions are of functional relevance for KSHV infection at endogenous protein

59

levels. Interestingly, in vitro infection of established B cell lines by cell-free KSHV is extremely

60

inefficient (7), while coculture of KSHV producing cells with target cells leads to robust

61

infection (8). BJAB cells (9) are used as a model for B cell infection by KSHV (7, 8) and B cell

62

biology in general (10). Our previous work had already demonstrated that cell-to-cell

63

transmission of KSHV into BJAB cells is susceptible to inhibition of the interaction with

64

receptors from the Eph family (6). An open question so far was which member of the Eph

65

family of receptor tyrosine kinases is the principal receptor for infection of these cells.

66

Additionally, we investigated the receptor requirements for BJAB infection by RRV, a closely

67

related gamma2-herpesvirus of rhesus macaques (11) to further characterize its significance

68

as an animal model virus for KSHV.

RESULTS

71

We performed a two-step pulldown from the lysate of BJAB cells using Strep-tagged Fc

72

fusion proteins of soluble versions of the gH proteins of KSHV, RRV 26-95 and RRV 17577

73

(12) in complex with the respective gL proteins as bait to identify cellular interaction

74

partners (Figure 1A). While our group works with RRV isolate 26-95, we included isolate

75

17577 to identify possible differences in receptor interactions between the two described

76

RRV isolates. Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified EphA7 as a prey in all three

77

binding reactions (Figure 1B). In pulldowns with both RRV gH/gL complexes, EphA7 was the

78

only membrane protein identified in excised bands in the 100-130kDa molecular weight

79

range. In the KSHV pulldown we additionally found several peptides derived from EphA5. A

80

comparison of the mRNA expression profiles of the 14 human Eph family receptors in a

81

dataset (13) deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database revealed that BJAB cells

82

predominantly express EphA7 (Figure 1C). We therefore focused our analysis on this

83

member of the Eph receptor family. To confirm our mass spectrometry results, we repeated

84

the pulldown with a similar experimental protocol and tested the precipitate for the

85

presence of EphA7 by Western blot analysis. We could confirm that using soluble gH/gL

86

complexes of KSHV and RRV 26-95 we pulled down a protein that reacted with an antibody

87

to EphA7 from BJAB lysate, but not from 293T lysate (Figure 1D). In contrast, EphA2 was

88

precipitated by KSHV gH/gL from 293T lysate but not from BJAB lysate, which mirrors

89

expression of the two receptors in BJAB or 293T, respectively (Figure 1E). To test the

90

functional relevance of the gH/gL-EphA7 interaction, we generated EPHA7 knockout (KO)

91

cell pools by transducing BJAB with lentiCRISPRv2-based constructs targeting EPHA7. All four

92

tested single guide RNAs (sgRNA) abrogated EphA7 expression compared to two non-

93

targeting guide RNAs or two guide RNAs targeting EPHA2 as assayed by Western blot (Figure

94

2A). EphA2, the described KSHV receptor for adherent cells, is not expressed to detectable

95

levels in BJAB cells (Figure 1E, 2B). The weak signal detected by the polyclonal EphA2

96

antibody in BJAB lysates appears at an apparent molecular weight below that of EphA2 in

97

293T cell lysate and is therefore most likely a non-specific reactivity, which would also be in

98

accordance with mRNA expression profiles in databases and the absence of EphA2 in our

99

initial pulldown experiment. After confirmation of the CRISPR/Cas9 knockout efficiency, we

100

used the knockout cell pools to analyze receptor function of EphA7 for infection of BJAB

101

cells. As BJAB cells are not readily amenable to infection with cell-free KSHV, we resorted to

102

the previously described coculture cell-to-cell transmission system. This method allows for

103

efficient infection of BJAB cells by overlaying chemically induced iSLK cells with BJAB cells

104

and resolution of the two populations by flow cytometry after staining for expression of

105

CD13 (as iSLK cell marker) and CD20 (as B cell marker) as described by Myoung et al. (8). In

106

addition to iSLK cells harboring BAC16 KSHV wt we included iSLK cells harboring our

107

previously described Eph-detargeted gH-ELAAN mutant in BJAB coculture experiments

108

(Figure 2C) (14). When the results obtained with all sgRNA constructs targeting one specific

109

gene were averaged (two non-targeting sgRNAs, two sgRNAs to EPHA2, four sgRNAS to

110

EPHA7), knockout of EPHA7 resulted in a 86% reduction of infection with wt KSHV, whereas

111

targeting EPHA2, which is not expressed at detectable levels as assayed by Western blot,

112

resulted in a 27% reduction of wt KSHV infection, which was not significant. Analysis of all

113

BJAB EPHA2KO or EPHA7KO cell pools compared to control cell pools in infection experiments

114

with KSHV gH-ELAAN did not indicate significant changes between any of the groups. RRV

115

26-95, as opposed to KSHV, readily infects BJAB cells as free virus. Therefore, we infected

116

the same set of knockout BJAB cells with cell-free wt RRV-YFP and with RRV-YFP gH-AELAAN,

117

an Eph-detargeted RRV mutant, analogous to KSHV gH-ELAAN (Figure 2D). While the results

118

obtained with RRV essentially paralleled those with KSHV, ablating EphA7 expression

119

resulted in an even more pronounced and significant reduction in infection for all EPHA7-

120

targeting constructs when compared to the non-targeting controls. When averaged, the

121

BJAB EPHA7KO cell pools exhibited a 95% reduction in RRV-YFP infection vs non-targeting

122

controls. Infection levels of RRV-YFP gH-AELAAN equaled RRV wt infection with matched

123

genome copy numbers on BJAB EPHA7KO cells, with no significant differences between

124

controls and EPHA2KO or EPHA7 KO cells.

125

As we still detected residual infectivity upon EPHA7 knockout, we wanted to address the

126

question, whether infection of EPHA7KO BJAB cells could be further inhibited by a treatment

127

with ephrinA4-Fc, a soluble Fc-fusion protein of a natural Eph ligand, which targets A-type

128

Ephs and blocks infection of adherent cells by cell-free KSHV (6). This would indicate

129

receptor functions of additional A-type Eph proteins other than EphA7. To this end we used

130

a reduced set of our knockout cell pools and treated the cells either with PBS (control) or

131

ephrinA4-Fc in PBS during the coculture experiment (Figure 3). While ephrin A4-Fc

132

significantly inhibited infection of both EPHA2KO BJAB cells and non-targeting control BJAB

133

cells compared to PBS by over 85%, infection of EPHA7KO BJAB cells was only reduced by 20%

134

in the presence of ephrinA4-Fc, which did not reach significance. It should be noted that

135

knockout of EPHA2 also lead to a small but significant reduction in infection in this

136

experiment using only a reduced set of sgRNA constructs.

137
138

DISCUSSION

139

We identified endogenous EphA7 in BJAB cell lysate as an interaction partner for the gH/gL

140

complexes of both KSHV and RRV. This is not surprising insofar that it had already been

141

shown in our previous publication that RRV binds relatively promiscuously to different Ephs,

142

and that KSHV binds EphA2 with high affinity, but can also interact with other Ephs, among

143

them EphA7, with lower affinity. We had also identified trace peptides of other Ephs

144

alongside peptides of EphA2 after pulldown with KSHV gH/gL previously. Additionally, we

145

had already identified EphA7 as an interaction partner for gH/gL of both RRV subtypes in

146

293T cells in a previous study (6). In contrast, we were not able to precipitate endogenous

147

EphA7 from 293T cells with KSHV gH/gL under similar conditions, as was the case in previous

148

studies. The reason for the lack of EphA7 – gH/gL interaction in 293T cells is most likely

149

either competition by e.g. EphA2 for binding to the KSHV gH/gL complex and/or differences

150

in relative expression of the different Ephs (Figure 1E). While a recent publication by TerBush

151

et al. (2) has already suggested that Ephs other than EphA2 can function as receptors for

152

KSHV, this has not been conclusively shown, as in this publication knockout of EPHA4 or

153

EPHA5 e.g. in SLK cell did not lead to a reduction in KSHV infection. Quite to the contrary,

154

EPHA4 knockout lead to an increase in infection. Demonstrating receptor function by a loss-

155

of-function experiment such as gene knockout and not only after recombinant

156

overexpression is therefore essential to demonstrate biological relevance at endogenous

157

expression levels and in a physiological context. So far, only EphA2 has passed this test in

158

several publications (2–5). We now show that knockout of EPHA7 in BJAB cells resulted in a

159

significant reduction in infection by both KSHV and RRV. For RRV, the remaining level of

160

infection was practically indistinguishable from that observed with the Eph-detargeted RRV5

161

YFP gH-AELAAN mutant, indicating that EphA7 is the principal Eph receptor for infection of

162

BJAB cells by RRV. For KSHV, EPHA7 knockout also reduced infection significantly by more

163

than 85%. For both viruses, residual levels of infection with the Eph-detargeted virus

164

mutants in both control and EPHA7KO BJAB cells confirm our previous results that the

165

interaction with Ephs contributes significantly to infection but is not strictly essential, most

166

likely because alternative receptors exist. Unlike for RRV, the level of KSHV infection

167

observed in the BJAB EPHA7KO cultures was still marginally higher than that observed in the

168

coculture experiments with iSLK harboring the Eph-detargeted KSHV gH-ELAAN. This

169

difference in infection could be due to interaction with additional Eph receptors other than

170

EphA7 by the KSHV gH/gL complex. The slight reduction of infection after transduction of

171

sgRNAs directed against EPHA2, which reached significance in one set of infections (Figure 3)

172

might hint at some residual function of EphA2 at very low expression levels. Our initial

173

finding of some peptides derived from EphA5 in the analysis of the gH/gL pulldown as well as

174

results by TerBush et al. demonstrating rescue of KSHV infection in EPHA2KO SLK cells by

175

recombinant EphA5 expression (2) furthermore suggest that EphA5 may also have a function

176

in mediating the remaining level of infection after knockout of EPHA7. However, we only

177

observed a very slight reduction of KSHV infection by treating the iSLK BAC16 KSHV wt/ BJAB

178

EPHA7 KO coculture with ephrinA4-Fc, which did not reach significance. In the light of this

179

inability to block KSHV infection of EPHA7 KO cells with ephrinA4-Fc and given the very small

180

difference in infection between KSHV wt on EPHA7 KO cells and infection with the Eph-

181

detargeted KSHV gH-ELAAN overall, any attempts of analyzing the function of additional

182

receptor interactions in this context would not be informative. Nevertheless, we think that it

183

is highly likely that other Ephs, which like EphA5 weakly but detectably interact with KSHV

184

gH/gL (6), may play a role similar to EphA7 for KSHV infection of other cell types, in

185

particular in the absence of the high-affinity EphA2 receptor. This should be addressed in

186

separate studies using loss-of-function methodology. Overall, while KSHV exhibits the

187

highest affinity for EphA2, our results demonstrate that KSHV uses other Ephs under

188

circumstances where these are more abundantly expressed, which parallels the interaction

189

of ephrins with their receptors (15) and receptor usage by RRV (6). Whether there is a direct

190

correlation between affinity and receptor function or whether the mechanism is more

191

complicated will also be a subject for future studies. A recent study on the role of

192

glycoprotein K8.1 A in the infection of B cells, but not in the infection of other cell types,

193

hints at possible mechanistic differences (16) specific for B cell infection, although infection

194

of BJAB by cell-to-cell transmission was not analyzed in that study. Another open question is

195

whether the function of EphA7 in cell-to-cell transmission is somewhat different from the

196

function of e.g. EphA2 in the infection of epithelial or endothelial cells, and whether the

197

specific nature of cell-to-cell transmission may allow for more efficient use of receptors with

198

comparatively lower affinity for gH/gL.

METHODS AND MATERIALS

201

Cells and virus. BJAB cell lines were obtained from the Leibniz-Institute DSMZ - Deutsche

202

Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH. iSLK cells were a kind gift from

203

Jinjong Myoung (17), 293T cells from Stefan Pöhlmann, and primary rhesus monkey

204

fibroblasts from Rüdiger Behr. BJAB cells were propagated in RPMI medium (Thermo Fisher

205

Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and

206

50µg/ml gentamycin (PAN Biotech). 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle

207

Medium (DMEM), high glucose, GlutaMAX, 25mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

208

supplemented with 10% FBS and 50μg/ml gentamycin. iSLK cells were maintained in DMEM

209

supplemented with 10% FBS, 50μg/ml gentamycin, 2.5μg/ml puromycin (InvivoGen) and

210

250μg/ml G418 (Carl Roth). RRV-YFP, RRV-YFP gH-AELAAN and iSLK cells harboring BAC16

211

KSHV wt or BAC16 KSHV gH-ELAAN were produced as described previously (14).

212

Coculture infections. iSLK cells were seeded in 48well plates at 100 000 cells per well. After

213

five hours, lytic replication was induced with 1µg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) and 2.5mM sodium

214

butyrate (Carl Roth) over night in DMEM, high glucose, GlutaMAX, 25mM HEPES with 10%

215

FBS. After one day, medium was exchanged to 400µl RPMI with 10% FBS and 50µg/ml

216

gentamycin and the respective BJAB cell pools at 40 000 cells per well. For blocking

217

experiments, recombinant ephrinA4-Fc protein (R&D Systems) was added at the start of the

218

coculture to a final concentration of 2µg/ml.

219

Flow cytometry analysis. Cocultured cells were harvested by pipetting and fixed with 2%

220

formaldehyde (Carl Roth) in PBS. The cells were stained with anti-CD13 (clone WM15, PE

221

coupled, BIOLEGEND) and anti-CD20 (clone 2H7, Alexa647 coupled, BIOLEGEND) antibodies

222

at a 1:50 dilution in 5% FBS in PBS for 30min – 45min. After 2 washes in PBS, the cells were

223

post-fixated in 2% formaldehyde in PBS. The samples were analyzed on a LSRII flow

224

cytometer (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry data was further analyzed using Flowing

226

out using GraphPad Prism version 6 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California

228

Generation of knockout cell pools. Knockout cell pools were generated using the

229

lentiCRISPRv2 system (18) as described previously (19), with the exception that transfection

230

was carried out using PEI (20). In short, BAJB cells were transduced with lentiviruses

231

harboring the indicated sgRNAs. After 48h the selection antibiotic puromycin (Invivogen)

232

was added to a final concentration of 10µg/ml. After initial selection the puromycin

233

concentration was reduced to 1µg/ml. The following single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were

234

inserted into plentiCRISPRv2 (a kind gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid number

241

sequences for all sgRNAs directed against EphA7 as well as EPHA2-2 were determined using

242

E-CRISP (21). The lentiCRISPRv2-sgEPHA2-1 plasmid was purchased from Genscript. NT

243

sgRNA sequences were taken from the GeCKO (version 2) library (18).

244

Pulldown experiments and Western blot. Two-step pulldown with specific elution and re-

245

precipitation using gH-FcStrep/gL complexes for identification by mass spectrometry was

246

performed as described previously (8) with 1ml of wet BJAB cell pellet in 4ml of lysis buffer

247

as starting material for pulldown per sample. The samples were then separated by

248

polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 8-16% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and the gel was

249

silver stained using the SilverQuest staining kit (Life Technologies). Mass spectrometry

250

analysis of individual gel bands was carried out by the Taplin mass spectrometry core facility,

251

Harvard Medical School. For pulldown followed by Western blot analysis, cells were lysed

252

with 1ml of lysis buffer (1% NP40 150mM NaCl 1mM EDTA 25mM HEPES pH7.3 with addition

253

of protease inhibitor cocktail (Amresco)) per ml of wet cell pellet. The lysate was clarified by

254

centrifugation 21 100g for 20min and reacted with gH-FcStrep/gL-Flag complexes that were

255

pre-coupled to Strep-Tactin XT (IBA) beads. After three washes with lysis buffer, the

256

precipitates were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot as
