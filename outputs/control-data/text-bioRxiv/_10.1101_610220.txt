Abstract

26

Mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam)-mediated mtDNA maintenance and

27

transcription, as well as leucine-rich PPR motif-containing protein (Lrpprc)-mediated

28

mtRNA maturation and translation are essential steps of mtDNA-encoded electron

29

transport chain (ETC) protein expression. ETC is essential for mitochondrial

30

thermogenesis, the process of oxygen-dependent heat production inside the

31

mitochondria in brown adipocytes. Here we describe that Tfam or Lrpprc deficiency in

32

brown adipocytes cause non-synchronized ETC mRNA and protein expression

33

(NOSEMPE) and mitochondrial ETC imbalance, ultimately abolish mitochondrial

34

thermogenesis. However, mice with NOSEMPE in brown adipocytes are cold resistant

35

upon an acute 4ºC cold challenge, because of augmented nonmitochondrial

36

thermogenesis driven by the “NOSEMPEàATF4àproteome turnover” pathway.

37

Importantly, mice with either NOSEMPE or ATF4 overexpression in brown adipocytes are

38

protected against high-fat-diet-induced metabolic abnormalities, indicating a positive

39

association between nonmitochondrial thermogenesis in brown adipocytes and metabolic

40

fitness. Thus, although brown adipocytes are defined by their unique ability to produce

41

heat through mitochondrial respiration, our study demonstrates a novel cytosolic

42

nonmitochondrial thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Targeting this ATF4-dependent

43

nonmitochondrial thermogenesis in brown adipocytes may represent a new therapeutic

44

strategy for combating metabolic disorders.

Energy balance requires equivalent energy intake from food and energy expenditure for

46

basal metabolism, physical activity and adaptive thermogenesis. The adaptive

47

thermogenesis refers to the heat production in response to environmental changes, which

mainly occurs in brown adipose tissue (BAT) containing specialized mitochondria-rich

Thus, increasing brown fat abundance to boost adaptive thermogenesis has been

The cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis (CIT), also called bAR-induced adaptive

thermogenesis in brown adipocytes

69

adipocyte-specific mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) knockout mice (TfamBKO)

70

exhibit a paradoxical trade-off between mitochondria-fueled bAR-induced adaptive

71

thermogenesis and systemic metabolism in mice 15. In this study, we further demonstrate

72

that disrupting mitochondrial quality (by the non-synchronized ETC mRNA and protein

73

expression, abbreviated as NOSEMPE) in brown adipocytes induces an ATF4-dependent

74

nonmitochondrial thermogenesis that is instead fueled by proteome turnover in the

75

cytosol. This nonmitochondrial thermogenesis in brown adipocytes can contribute to

76

organismal thermoregulation under acute cold stress and promote metabolic health,

77

which unveils a new function of brown adipocytes in systemic thermoregulation and

78

metabolism.

induced “whitening” of brown adipocytes at room temperature (RT) (Fig.1b). But both

92

wild-type and Lrpprc-deficient brown adipocytes exhibited unilocular morphology

93

uniformly at thermoneutrality (30ºC) (Fig.1b), where mitochondrial respiration in brown

94

adipocytes is not needed for organismal thermoregulation.

95
96

As we expected, steady-state mRNA levels of most mtDNA-encoded genes were reduced

97

in the BAT of LrpprcBKO mice, without significant changes in nuclear-encoded ETC genes

98

or mtDNA copy numbers (Fig.1c, Supplementary Fig.1e). This specific reduction of

99

mtDNA-encoded ETC genes was also observed in the BAT of LrpprcBKO mice housed at

100

30ºC (Fig.1c). Immunoblots further confirmed that mtDNA-encoded complex IV proteins,

101

mtCo1 and mtCo2, were reduced in isolated BAT mitochondria from LrpprcBKO mice

102

(Fig.1d, Supplementary Fig.2g). Interestingly, nuclear-encoded complex IV subunits,

103

such as Cox4, Cox5b and Cox6b, were also reduced at both ambient temperatures, even

104

though their mRNA levels were largely unaffected (Fig.1c, d). In contrast, Atp5a (complex

105

V), Uqcrc2 (complex III), Sdhb (complex II) and Ndufb8 (complex I) protein levels remain

106

unaffected (Supplementary Fig.2g).

107
108

In order to obtain a global view of their mitochondrial proteome, we performed mass

109

spectrometry analysis of freshly isolated BAT mitochondria from control and LrpprcBKO

110

mice at normal chow housed at both RT and 30ºC. We identified approximately 670

111

mitochondrial proteins for further analyses (Supplementary Fig.2a-c, Supplementary

112

profound metabolic reprogramming in Lrpprc-deficient brown adipocytes, including the

114

enzymes involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle and beta-oxidation, except for the upregulation

115

of Acot2 (Supplementary Fig.2f). Lrpprc deficiency did cause similar changes in

116

mitochondrial ETC proteome at both RT and 30°C. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis

117

showed that mitochondrial respiratory chain, NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) and

118

cytochrome C oxidase (complex IV) activities were the most affected by Lrpprc deficiency

119

at both ambient temperatures (Supplementary Fig.2d, e). The complex IV enzyme

120

activity in vitro was attenuated in the BAT of LrpprcBKO mice (Fig.1f). To quantitate the

121

BAT ETC proteome, we calculated the average log2 fold change (log2FC) values for all

122

complex proteins identified and we found that complex IV was the most affected (Fig.1e),

123

suggesting that an ETC proteome imbalance is induced by Lrpprc deficiency in brown

124

adipocytes.

125
126

Previously we reported the BAT mitochondrial proteome in brown adipocyte-specific Lkb1

127

and Tfam knockout mice (Lkb1BKO and TfamBKO)

128

mitochondrial proteomic changes induced by Tfam or Lrpprc deficiency were similar

129

(Supplementary Fig.2h). Comparing the BAT mitochondrial proteome in TfamBKO and

130

LrpprcBKO mice, we found that proteins involved in mitochondrial protein import (Timm10,

131

Pam16, and Dnajc15) and proteases (Afg3l1, Afg3l2 and Lonp1) were selectively

132

upregulated (Supplementary Fig.2i), suggesting that Lrpprc or Tfam deficiency induces

133

a similar mitochondrial proteome remodeling in response to ETC proteome imbalance.

then used indirect calorimetry experiments to measure bAR-induced adaptive

thermogenesis, as well as basal energy expenditure (EE, calculated from oxygen

10-week-old male control and LrpprcBKO mice at RT and 30°C. Body weights of LrpprcBKO

147

and control mice were not different at this age. At basal state, there were no differences

148

in basal EE, RER, food intake and physical activity (Fig.1g, Supplementary Fig.3).

169

In order to identify the underlying mechanisms for NOSEMPE-induced nonmitochondrial

170

thermogenesis, we first performed RNA-seq experiments from the BAT of male control

171

and LrpprcBKO mice housed at RT and 30ºC. Clustering analysis of differentially

172

expressed genes (DEGs) suggested that thermoneutral housing affected BAT

173

transcriptome more profoundly than Lrpprc deficiency (Fig.2a). Volcano plots of DEGs

174

showed that there were approximately 6 times more up- and down-regulated DEGs in

175

LrpprcBKO mice at 30ºC (Fig.2b). Within downregulated DEGs, 132 genes were commonly

176

observed at both RT and 30ºC. The Oxidative phosphorylation pathway was the most

177

significantly enriched in downregulated DEGs at both ambient temperatures

178

(Supplementary Fig.5a, b). Indeed, the sequencing reads of all 13 mtDNA-encoded ETC

179

subunits were reduced in the BAT of LrpprcBKO mice (Supplementary Fig.5c), consistent

180

with our q-PCR analysis (Fig.1c).

181
182

On the other hand, pathways of immune cell activation and protein homeostasis were

183

highly enriched among the upregulated 165 genes at both RT and 30ºC (Supplementary

184

Fig.5d, e). Cis-regulatory sequence analysis using iRegulon predicted that ATF4 and its

185

downstream transcription factors ATF3 and DDIT3 were the top regulators of the

186

upregulated DEGs (Fig2.c). For example, 39 (out of 165) genes were predicted to contain

187

putative ATF4 response element “TTGCATCA” on their promoter regions. These genes

188

regulated diverse cellular processes, such as response to ER stress, cellular amino acid

189

metabolism, transport of small molecules, one-carbon metabolism, steroid metabolism

190

and fibroblast proliferation (Fig.2d). We experimentally confirmed that the mRNA levels

191

of the ATF4 targets were upregulated in the BAT of LrpprcBKO mice at both RT and 30ºC

192

fed with either normal chow or HFD (Supplementary Fig.6a). Interesting, several ATF4

193

targets, such as Cyb5r1, Pck2 and Lonp1, were also identified amongst the upregulated

194

proteins in the BAT mitochondria from both TfamBKO and LrpprcBKO mice (Supplementary

195

Fig.2i). Thus, this transcriptomic profiling study indicates that ATF4 transcription network,

196

also called the integrated stress response (ISR), is activated by NOSEMPE in brown

197

adipocytes.

198
199

The ISR is centrally controlled by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation

200

factor eIF2a. When phosphorylated, it specifically induces ATF4 translation and its target

gene expression 27. Indeed, we observed phosphor-eIF2a and Atf4 protein were elevated,

202

along with known ATF4 targets in the BAT of LrpprcBKO mice at RT and 30ºC (Fig.2e).

203

TfamBKO mice, but not betaless mice, showed a similar induction of p-eIF2a in the BAT

204

(Supplementary Fig.6b, c). Additional clustering analysis using these ATF4 targets in

205

various mouse models with defective thermogenesis such as betaless, GnasBKO,

thermogenesis in brown adipocytes (Fig.2f).

15,24

clearly demonstrated that ATF4-dependent ISR was

209
210

Nonmitochondrial thermogenesis induced by NOSEMPE and ATF4 is dependent

211

on proteome turnover

212

Since elevated ATF4 expression is sufficient for transcriptional induction of its targets in

213

vitro and in vivo

214

adipocytes to examine its consequences on mitochondrial thermogenesis and

215

nonmitochondrial thermogenesis. We have crossed ROSA-LSL-FlaghATF4 (Flag-tagged

216

human ATF4 flanked by stop cassette in ROSA locus) with Ucp1-Cre mice, to generate

217

brown adipocyte-specific ATF4 overexpressing mice (ATF4BOX) and their controls

218

(Supplementary Fig.7a). Flag immunoblot confirmed the presence of Flag-ATF4 protein

219

in the BAT of the ~8-week-old ATF4BOX mice at normal chow at RT (Supplementary

220

Fig.7b). Similar to LrpprcBKO and TfamBKO mice, ATF4BOX mice exhibited marked

221

upregulation of ATF4 target gene network in the BAT at both RT and 30°C (Fig.3a),

222

further confirming the ISR activation by ATF4 overexpression in the BAT. Thus, the

223

ATF4BOX mice phenocopied the LrpprcBKO and TfamBKO mice in regard to the brown

224

adipocyte ISR activation specifically.

28,29

, we then decided to ectopically overexpress ATF4 in brown

225
226

Indirect calorimetry experiments showed that the ATF4BOX mice exhibited the similar bAR-

227

induced adaptive thermogenesis as control mice at both ambient temperatures, so did

228

the basal EE, RER, food intake and physical activity (Fig.3b, c, Supplementary Fig.7d-

229

f). This was consistent with the lack of changes in BAT thermogenic and ETC (nuclear-

230

and mtDNA-encoded) gene expression (Fig.3a, Supplementary Fig.7c). Therefore,

231

ATF4 overexpression in brown adipocytes does not affect mitochondrial ETC gene

232

expression and bAR-induced adaptive thermogenesis. When housed at RT, ATF4BOX

233

mice were cold resistant as the control mice during CTT, because mitochondrial

234

thermogenesis was not affected by the ATF4 overexpression in brown adipocytes

235

(Fig.3d). Thermoneutral housing (lack of sympathetic inputs) reduces PGC1a expression

236

and mitochondrial biogenesis in brown adipocytes, similar to Gnas deficiency

237

Therefore, wild-type mice, acclimated to thermoneutrality, rapidly drop their core

238

temperature upon CTT due to diminished mitochondrial thermogenesis. However,

239

ATF4BOX mice exhibited enhanced cold resistance during CTT from 30°C (Fig.3d), further

suggesting the presence of ATF4-dependent nonmitochondrial thermogenesis in brown

adipocytes.

Besides Ucp1-mediated uncoupling in mitochondria, heat can be generated through futile

such as calcium cycle, creatine cycle, triglyceride-fatty acid cycle, and glycolysis-

by wasting ATP to generate heat as the byproduct

249

genes, involved multiple steps in amino acid synthesis (Prcy1, Phgdh, Psat1 and Mthdf2),

250

amino acid transporters (Slc7a1, Slc7a5, Slc38a2), and protein synthesis (aminoacyl-

251

tRNA synthetases: Wars, Eprs, Aars) were upregulated by NOSEMPE and ATF4

252

overexpression in brown adipocytes (Fig.2d), we reason that ATF4 may promote

253

proteome turnover primarily due to its anabolic action on protein synthesis.

36

. As numerous ATF4 signature

254
255

We evaluated rates of protein synthesis in the BAT of ATF4BOX mice at both RT and 30ºC.

256

First, ribosome protein S6 and mRNA translation repressor 4Ebp1 were highly

257

phosphorylated in the BAT of ATF4BOX mice (Fig.3e), reflecting a higher activity of

258

mTORC1 (the master regulator of protein synthesis)

259

protein synthesis rate by puromycin labeling

260

elevated in the BAT of ATF4BOX mice (Fig.3e). Next, a protein synthesis inhibitor

261

(rapamycin) was used to determine the contributions of protein synthesis to the increased

262

cold resistance phenotype of the ATF4BOX mice acclimated at 30ºC. Pretreatment of

263

4mg/kg rapamycin fully abolished elevated p-S6, p-4Ebp1, total puromycylated proteins

264

in the BAT of ATF4BOX mice (Supplementary Fig.8a). Importantly, ATF4BOX mice were

265

no longer cold resistant after rapamycin treatment, although control mice behaved

266

similarly during CTT with or without rapamycin (Fig.3f). In contrast, global protein

267

synthesis was not affected in the muscle of the ATF4BOX mice, and rapamycin did not

268

affect the phosphorylation of S6 and 4Ebp1, and the rates of global protein synthesis in

269

the muscle (Supplementary Fig.8b), suggesting the effect of rapamycin in cold

38

37

. We then evaluated the global

270

resistance phenotype in the ATF4BOX mice was due to inhibition of mTORC1-dependent

271

protein synthesis specifically in the BAT.

272
273

In parallel, the global ubiquitinated proteins were also elevated (Fig.3e) and proteasome

274

inhibitor (bortezomib) had a similar effect in ATF4BOX mice during CTT (Fig.3f). Inhibition

275

of protein synthesis by rapamycin also reduced total ubiquitinated proteins in the BAT of

276

ATF4BOX mice (Supplementary Fig.8a), suggesting that protein synthesis and

277

degradation were coupled and the accelerated proteome turnover in brown adipocytes

278

contributed to the cold resistance phenotype in the ATF4BOX mice.

279
280

We next assessed BAT proteome turnover in LrpprcBKO mice similarly. Phosphorylated

281

S6 and 4Ebp1 and puromycylated and ubiquitinated proteins were elevated in the BAT of

282

LrpprcBKO mice (Supplementary Fig.9a). Treatment with rapamycin or bortezomib

283

suppressed the cold resistance phenotype of the LrpprcBKO mice without any noticeable

284

changes in control mice in CTT (Fig.3f). TfamBKO mice, another mouse model of BAT

285

NOSEMPE, showed similar phenotypes (Fig.3f, Supplementary Fig.9b). Collectively,

286

ATF4-mediated proteome turnover constitutes a mechanism of nonmitochondrial

287

thermogenesis in brown adipocytes.

289

NOSEMPE and ATF4 activation in brown adipocytes promote systemic metabolism

Next, we characterized the metabolic consequences of elevated nonmitochondrial

temperatures (Supplementary Fig.10a). At ~8-month of age, LrpprcBKO mice exhibited

294

reduced adipose mass in BAT, subcutaneous inguinal WAT (iWAT) and visceral

295

epididymal WAT (eWAT) (Supplementary Fig.10b, c).

296
297

Male LrpprcBKO mice gained less body weight under high fat diet (HFD) (Fig.4a). The

298

difference in body weight was already evident after 4 weeks on HFD and became greater

299

after longer-period HFD (Fig.4a, c). After 12-week HFD, body weight gains of LrpprcBKO

300

mice were only 28% and 37% of those of control littermates. The body weight difference

301

was mainly contributed by reduction of fat mass. Fat percentage was increased in control

302

mice by four-fold by 12-week HFD, but it barely increased in LrpprcBKO mice (Fig.4d). Fat

303

depots like iWAT and eWAT showed progressively reduced weight under HFD and

304

contained smaller adipocytes, and BAT only showed reduced weight after 12-week HFD

305

(Fig.4b, c). The adipocyte size in eWAT was also reduced in LrpprcBKO mice after HFD

306

(Fig.4e, f).

307
308

We also measured other HFD-induced metabolic parameters in male LrpprcBKO mice.

309

Systemic insulin sensitivity was improved in LrpprcBKO mice (Fig.4g-i) as early as after 4-

310

week HFD, and serum insulin levels were significantly reduced at 12-week HFD (Fig.4j).

311

HFD-induced hypertriglyceridemia was completely inhibited in LrpprcBKO mice. Serum

312

triglyceride contents were elevated by about four-fold (over 200 mg/dL) in control mice at

313

RT but remained at lower levels (<40 mg/dL) in LrpprcBKO mice after 12-week HFD

314

(Fig.4k). Similar results were also obtained at 30°C (Fig.4l). HFD also induced ectopic

315

triglyceride accumulation in the liver in control mice, which was also absent in LrpprcBKO

316

mice (Fig.4m-o). HFD-induced adipose inflammation was suppressed by Lrpprc

317

deficiency in brown adipocytes. Q-PCR analysis showed macrophage markers (Cd68,

318

F4/80 and Cd11c) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Ccl2 and Leptin) were reduced in the

319

eWAT of LrpprcBKO mice after 12-week HFD (Fig.4q-r) and serum leptin levels were also

320

reduced (Fig.4p). Thus, Lrpprc deficiency in brown adipocytes in BAT leads to the

321

protection against HFD-induced obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis,

322

hypertriglyceridemia, and adipose inflammation, despite defective thermogenesis in BAT.

323

The reduced adiposity and liver TG phenotypes were also observed in female LrpprcBKO

324

mice (Supplementary Fig.11a-d). Thus, BAT NOSEMPE improves systemic metabolism

325

in the LrpprcBKO and TfamBKO mice despite a complete absence of bAR-induced adaptive

326

thermogenesis.

327
328

In order to determine whether ATF4 activation in wild-type brown adipocytes is sufficient

329

to drive systemic metabolic benefits, we performed HFD experiments similarly on

330

ATF4BOX mice at both RT and 30°C. Indeed, ATF4-ISR remained elevated in the BAT of

331

ATF4BOX mice even after HFD (Fig.5b). ATF4BOX mice gained less body weight, which

332

was contributed by reduced adiposity (Fig.5a, c, d). Again, other metabolic parameters

333

such as increased adipocyte size and inflammation in white adipose tissue (Fig.5e, f, m),

334

systemic insulin resistance (Fig.5g-i), hepatosteatosis and hyperlipidemia (Fig.5j-l) were

335

all suppressed by ATF4 overexpression in brown adipocytes. Taken together, ATF4

336

activation in brown adipocytes is sufficient to induce nonmitochondrial thermogenesis

337

from BAT (without an increase of bAR-induced adaptive thermogenesis) and improves

338

systemic metabolism.

While Atf4 global knockout mice are lean 39,40, Atf4’s specific role in brown adipocytes is

343

unknown. To address this question, we have generated brown adipocyte-specific Atf4

344

knockout mice (Ucp1-Cre;Atf4f/f, Atf4BKO). Atf4 deficiency in brown adipocytes reduced

345

ATF4 target gene expression but did not affect multilocular morphology at RT and

346

mitochondrial ETC gene expression at RT and 30°C (Supplementary Fig12.a, b).

347

Indirect calorimetry experiments showed that Atf4 deficiency did not affect basal and CL-

348

induced EE, RER, food intake and physical activity (Supplementary Fig12.c-g). Most

349

importantly, HFD-induced obesity, insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis and hyperlipidemia

were not altered by Atf4 deficiency (Supplementary Fig12.h-o).

We then determined whether Atf4 activation in brown adipocytes was required for the

354

have generated brown adipocyte-specific Lrpprc and Atf4 double knockout mice (Ucp1-

355

Cre;Lrpprcf/f;Atf4f/f, Lrpprc;Atf4BKO). Lrpprc and Atf4 double deficient brown adipocytes

356

were unilocular and exhibited reduced mtDNA ETC gene expression and p-eIF2a, similar

357

to the LrpprcBKO mice (Supplementary Fig.13a, b, Fig.6a). Consistently, the

358

Lrpprc;Atf4BKO mice at 30°C also lacked CL-induced EE due to the defect of mtDNA gene

359

expression in brown adipocytes (Fig.6b,c), but without noticeable changes in basal EE,

food intake and physical activity (Supplementary Fig.14a-c). However, the upregulation

362

Lrpprc deficiency was attenuated by additional Atf4 deficiency in brown adipocytes

363

(Supplementary Fig.13b, Fig.6a). The Lrpprc;Atf4BKO mice were no longer cold resistant

364

in CTT, although Atf4 deficiency itself in brown adipocytes did not affect core body

365

temperature during CTT (Supplementary Fig.13c). We then characterized the full

366

spectrum of metabolic performance of Lrpprc;Atf4BKO mice at 30ºC. Compared to the

367

LrpprcBKO mice, the Lrpprc;Atf4BKO mice were no longer protected against HFD-induced

368

obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy, systemic insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis and

369

hyperlipidemia (Fig.6d-h, Supplementary Fig.15a-f). Thus, Atf4 activation is required for

370

the NOSEMPE-induced, proteome turnover-fueled nonmitochondrial thermogenesis in

371

brown adipocytes, and Atf4 deletion fully reverses metabolic benefits without affecting

372

mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial thermogenesis in the LrpprcBKO mice.

DISCUSSION

375

Comparative studies have suggested that the appearance of thermogenic BAT in

376

endotherms provides an advantage to survive in cold environment throughout evolution

377

41

378

adaptive thermogenesis. Thus, active brown adipocytes in rodents and humans are

379

defined by three criteria: multilocular in morphology, rich in mitochondria and positive for

380

UCP1. Divergent from this “mitochondrial thermogenesis” centric view, our studies

381

demonstrate that the unilocular and mitochondrial respiration-defective brown adipocytes

382

in LrpprcBKO and TfamBKO mice (especially at thermoneutrality) can also efficiently

383

promote systemic metabolic health. Since adult humans mostly live at the thermoneutral

384

condition, it is feasible that these adipocytes will have the potential to regulate systemic

385

metabolism through the mechanism observed in mice with BAT NOSEMPE or ATF4

386

activation.

387
388

Moreover, a new concept termed as “nonmitochondrial thermogenesis” is emerging.

389

Distinct from the well-studied mitochondrial thermogenesis (the bAR-dependent heat

390

production inside mitochondria), this nonmitochondrial thermogenesis can operate

391

without bAR stimulation. When housed at RT with mild cold stress, wild-type mice process

392

activated mitochondrial thermogenesis and minimal nonmitochondrial thermogenesis.

393

GnasBKO (or betaless or Ucp1 KO) mice or wild-type mice at thermoneutrality lose

394

mitochondrial thermogenesis (without changes in nonmitochondrial thermogenesis),

395

consequently showing defective thermoregulation in CTT. Even though TfamBKO and

396

LrpprcBKO mice also lack mitochondrial thermogenesis completely at RT, they can still

397

maintain their core temperature during CTT through augmented ATF4-dependent

398

nonmitochondrial thermogenesis. Furthermore, ATF4BOX mice after thermoneutral

399

housing even exhibited enhanced cold resistance in CTT. Collectively, mitochondrial

400

thermogenesis and nonmitochondrial thermogenesis are both crucial for organismal

401

thermoregulation, and nonmitochondrial thermogenesis can even compensate for the

402

deficiency of mitochondrial thermogenesis in vivo.

403
404

However, there are still several unanswered questions regarding this nonmitochondrial

405

thermogenesis. Cellular proteome balance is precisely controlled by the capacity, velocity

406

and fidelity of protein synthesis and degradation in the cytosol 42, and its maintenance is

407

the most energy-consuming process (utilizing about one-third of total energy)

43-45

.

Although we have demonstrated the “NOSEMPEàATF4àproteome turnover” pathway

409

as a candidate mechanism for nonmitochondrial thermogenesis in brown adipocytes, its

12 hours, before administration of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG (3.94±0.17 MBq,

480

range: 3.67-4.17 MBq) was administered intravenously via tail vein under anesthesia (2-

481

2.5% isoflurane). Uptake time of 55 min (±1 min) was strictly followed before the start of

482

the scan. During the uptake time, the animals were awake and kept warm over a

483

temperature-controlled heating pad at 37 °C. Ten-minute static PET data were acquired

484

for all animals, followed by CT under isoflurane (2-2.5%) anesthesia. The total imaging

485

time was under 20 minutes. Once the data for PET and CT were acquired, reconstructions

504

1mM EGTA, pH 7.4) by sonication (5 second pulse x 5, 60% power) using a Microson

505

XL2000 Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor (Misonix). Protein was quantitated using the Bradford

assay and all samples were diluted to a final concentration of 1µg/µl of protein. The

spectrophotometric kinetic assays were performed using a monochromator microplate

determined by measuring oxidation of NADH at 340 nm (using ferricyanide as the electron

at RT or 30°C (n=3 for each genotype/condition) were resuspended in 8 M urea, 50 mM

fragmented by HCD and detected in the ion trap. All data were searched against the Mus

Immunoblots: Puromycin (ThermoFisher, #A1113803) was injected intraperitoneally at

563

the dose of 0.04 µmol g-1 30 minutes prior to tissue collection. For lysates, tissues were

564

lysed in ice-cold lysis-buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM EGTA,

565

20 mM NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1µM MG132 and protease inhibitors) using a TissueLyser

578

Q-PCR and RNA-seq: Total RNA was extracted from tissues homogenized in TRIsure

579

(Bioline, #BIO-38033) reagent and ISOLATE II RNA Mini kit (Bioline, #BIO-52073).

580

Isolated RNA was reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad, #170-

581

8891), and the resulting cDNA was used for quantitative PCR on a CFX384 real-time

582

PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Relative mRNA expression level was determined using

583

the 2(-Delta Ct) method with 36B4 as the internal reference control. Primer sequences

584

are listed in Supplementary Table 2. RNA-seq was performed by Novogene Inc. Briefly,

585

first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse

586

Transcriptase (RNase H). Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed

587

using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Double-stranded cDNA was purified using

588

AMPure XP beads. Remaining overhangs of the purified double-stranded cDNA were

589

converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3'

590

ends of DNA fragments, NEBNext Adaptor with hairpin loop structure was ligated to

prepare for hybridization. In order to select cDNA fragments of preferentially 150~200bp

592

in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter,

593

Beverly, USA). The libraries were sequenced in Illumina for 20 million reads with pair-end

594

150 bp (PE150). Downstream analysis was performed using a combination of programs

595

including STAR, HTseq and Cufflink. Alignments were parsed using Tophat program and

596

differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined through DESeq2/edgeR. KEGG

597

enrichment was implemented by ClusterProfiler. Cis-regulatory sequence analysis was

598

performed using iRegulon plugin in Cytoscape.

599

mtDNA Quantification: The relative mtDNA content was measured using qPCR. The β2

600

microglobulin gene (B2M) was used as the nuclear gene (nDNA) normalizer for

601

calculation of the mtDNA/nDNA ratio. A 322bp region of the mouse mtDNA was amplified

602

using forward primer mtDNAF (CGACCTCGATGTTGGATCA) and the reverse primer

603

mtDNAR (AGAGGATTTGAACCTCTGG). A fragment of the B2M gene was amplified

604

using forward primer, B2MF (TCTCTGCTCCCCACCTCTAAGT), and reverse primer,

605

B2MR (TGCTGTCTCGATGTTTGATGTATCT), giving an amplicon of 106 bp. The

606

relative mtDNA content was calculated using the formula: mtDNA content = 1/2ΔCt, where

607

ΔCt = CtmtDNA − CtB2M.

608

Quantification and statistical analysis

609

Data was presented as average ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by t-test

610

using GraphPad Prism 7. *: p<0.05 and **: p<0.01. Sample sizes for animal experiments

611

were selected based on numbers typically used in similar published studies. No

612

randomization of animals or predetermination of sample sizes by statistical methods was
