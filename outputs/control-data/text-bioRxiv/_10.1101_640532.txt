Abstract
Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causal agent for Kaposi sarcoma

27

(KS), the most common malignancy in people living with HIV/AIDS. The oral cavity is a major

28

route for KSHV infection and transmission. However, how KSHV breaches the oral epithelial

29

barrier for spreading to the body is not clear. Here we show that extracellular vesicles (EVs)

30

purified from saliva of HIV-positive individuals and secreted by HIV-1-infected T cells promote

31

KSHV infectivity in both monolayer and 3-dimensional models of immortalized and primary

32

human oral epithelial cells, establishing the latency of the virus. The HIV trans-activation

33

response (TAR) element RNA in HIV-associated EVs contributes to the infectivity of KSHV

34

through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Cetuximab, a monoclonal neutralizing

35

antibody to EGFR, blocks HIV-associated EV-enhanced KSHV infection. Our findings reveal

36

that saliva containing HIV-associated EVs is a risk factor for enhancement of KSHV infection

37

and that inhibition of EGFR serves as a novel strategy for controlling KSHV infection and

38

transmission in the oral cavity.

Author summary
Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a causal agent for Kaposi sarcoma

considered the most common route for spreading of the virus among HIV/AIDS patients.

However, the role of HIV-specific components in co-transfection of KSHV is unclear. We

Introduction
Kaposi sarcoma (KS), the most common malignancy in patients infected with HIV, is

54

etiologically associated with infection by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also

55

known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) [1]. This oncogenic gamma-herpesvirus is also linked

56

with primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD), and KSHV

57

inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) in aging people and immune compromised adults [2].

58

Oral transmission of KSHV through saliva in particular is believed to be the most common route

59

for spreading of the virus among homosexual people and “mother to child” transmission [3,4].

60

The oral mucosa has shown to be the first target of KSHV infection once the virus is in the oral

61

cavity [5,6,7,8,9]. Although KS incidence has dramatically decreased in developed countries in

62

the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), KS remains the most frequent tumor in the HIV-infected

63

population worldwide [10,11,12]. The oral milieu of HIV-infected patients has long been

64

deduced to favor KSHV infection; however, the role of HIV in KSHV infection and transmission

65

is largely unknown.

66
67

Most types of cells can release lipid membrane-enclosed vesicles, generally called

68

extracellular vesicles (EVs), into the extracellular space and body fluids. Saliva and other body

69

fluids contain a variety of EVs [13,14,15,16]. EVs are highly heterogeneous and dynamic and

70

can be generally grouped into exosomes [17,18,19,20], macrovesicles [21], and apoptotic bodies

71

based on biogenesis and the origin of vesicles [22]. EVs contain molecular components of their

72

cells of origin, including proteins and RNAs, to play roles in intercellular communication,

73

molecular transfer, and immune regulation at local and distant sites [13,20,23]. EVs derived from

74

culture supernatants of latently HIV-1-infected T-cell clones do not contain HIV-1 viral

75

particles, although these EVs do contain viral proteins such as Gag and the precursor form of

76

Env protein (p160) [24]. The HIV transactivation response (TAR) element RNA, a precursor of

77

several HIV-encoded miRNAs, can fold in the nascent transcript and facilitate binding of the

78

viral transcriptional trans-activator (Tat) protein to enhance transcription initiation and

79

elongation of HIV [25]. EVs isolated from HIV-1-infected cells or from HIV-positive patient

80

sera contain TAR RNA in vast excess of total viral RNA [24,26]. TAR RNA-bearing EVs can

81

induce proinflammatory cytokines in primary macrophages [27] and stimulate proliferation,

82

migration and invasion of head and neck and lung cancer cells in an epidermal growth factor

83

receptor (EGFR)-dependent manner [26]. EVs in body fluids of HIV/AIDS patients may

84

mediate HIV-1 RNA and protein trafficking and affect HIV pathogenesis [28,29]. However, the

85

role of salivary HIV-associated EVs in co-infection of KSHV has not been explored [29].

86
87

Here, we report that EVs purified from the saliva of HIV-infected patients and secreted

88

from culture medium of latently HIV-infected T cells enhance KSHV infectivity in human oral

89

epithelial cells cultured in both monolayer and 3-dimenional (3-D) formats. EVs from T cells

90

infected with an HIV-1 provirus, which contains a dysfunctional mutant HIV Tat and lack of the

91

Nef gene, can still stimulate KSHV infection. Although HIV-associated (HIV+) EVs lack viral

92

proteins that are involved in cellular processes; they contain the HIV TAR RNA in excess of

93

other HIV RNAs. We demonstrate that TAR RNA alone and TAR RNA-bearing EVs are able to

94

enhance KSHV infectivity in oral epithelial cells, indicating the importance of the HIV TAR

95

RNA in promoting KSHV infection. HIV+ EV-enhanced KSHV infection is blocked by the

96

monoclonal antibody against EGFR. Our findings reveal that HIV+ saliva EVs is a risk factor for

97

enhancement of KSHV infection and that inhibition of EGFR serves as a novel strategy for

98

potentially controlling KSHV infection and transmission in the oral cavity.

Results

101

HIV-associated EVs enhance KSHV infectivity in oral epithelial cells. We treated iSLK-

102

BAC16 cells with sodium butyrate and doxycyline to produce infectious KSHV virions, which

103

contain a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette for monitoring success infection in terget cells

104

[30]. To determine the multiplicity of infection (MOI) for each of KSHV stocks, we infected the

105

immortalized oral epithelial line OKF6/TERT2 [31] using each KSHV preparation at various

106

dilutions for 24 hr, followed by immunofluorescent staining of cells for KSHV-specific markers.

107

We found that KSHV infected OKF6/TERT2 cells, leading to expression of the KSHV latency-

108

associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and GFP and that 1:100 dilution of the KSHV stocks was

109

estimaed to equal to MOI 0.1, which was used throuout all the experiments to ensure consistant

110

results (S1 Fig).

111
112

To determine whether HIV+ EVs were able to affect KSHV infection in oral epithelial

113

cells, we incubated OKF6/TERT2 cells with KSHV virions in the presence of EVs isolated from

114

culture supernatants of latently HIV-1-infected J1.1 T cells or control “virus-free” Jurkat cells

115

[26,32]. HIV+ EVs from J1.1 cells significantly enhanced KSHV infection compared to those

116

isolated from control Jurkat T cells as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy of LANA

117

and GFP proteins (Fig 1A) and flow cytometry on GFP of infected cells (Fig 1B and 1C),

118

suggesting that HIV+ EVs potentially stimulated KSHV infectivity in oral epithelial cells. KSHV

119

infects the oral cavity and oropharynx and the infection is more prevalent in HIV-positive people

120

than that in the general population [6,33]. We postulated that saliva EVs in people living with

121

HIV might be responsible for the higher KSHV infection in HIV patients. To test this hypothesis,

122

EVs were purified from the saliva of HIV-infected donors and healthy individuals using the

123

differential ultracentrifugation protocol [26]. To determine whether EVs prepared from saliva

124

met the minimal requirement for EVs [34], we conducted immumoblotting on total saliva EVs.

125

Saliva EVs from both HIV+ and HIV- donors contained tetraspanin proteins CD63, CD9 and

126

CD81 (Fig 2A), suggesting presence of exosomes in the EV preparations [34]. In addition, the

127

total EV protein amount was proportionally increased as more saliva was used in EV

128

purifications (S2 table), indicating our protocol was able to purified EVs from saliva samples

129

[34]. To determine whether HIV+ saliva EVs had HIV-specific components, we performed RT-

130

PCR on total EV RNA and found that only HIV+ saliva EVs contained HIV TAR, Tat and Nef

131

RNA, but not Env RNA (Fig 2B) [26], indicating that saliva of HIV-infected people contained

132

HIV+ EVs. To evaluate the effect of saliva EVs on KSHV infection, we infected OKF6/TERT2

133

cells with KSHV in the presence of EVs from saliva of HIV-infected subjects and control people,

134

respectively. Saliva EVs from HIV-infected subjects (Fig 2C, P8 and P9) significantly enhanced

135

KSHV infection in OKF6/TERT2 cells compared to EVs from the saliva of healthy individuals

136

(Fig 2C, N1 and N3) as determined by GFP flow cytometry. To determine whether KSHV was

137

able to infect primary human oral epithelial cells (HOECs), we treated the cells with KSHV

138

virions and found that KSHV-infected HOECs and infected cells expressed KSHV LANA and

139

GFP (Fig 2D), indicating that KSHV can infect primary oral epithelial cells. To test whether

140

HIV+ EVs were able to stimulate KSHV infection in these cells, we treated HOECs with EVs

141

from J1.1 and Jurkat cells as well as those purified from saliva of HIV+ or HIV- donors. EVs

142

isolated from HIV+ T cells or purified from the saliva of HIV-infected donors significantly

143

stimulated KSHV infection in HOECs compared to EVs from control T cells and saliva of

144

healthy donors, respectively (Fig 2E). To verify the stimulatory effect of HIV+ saliva EVs on

145

KSHV infection, we treated HOECs with saliva EVs derived from HIV-infected donors (n=8),

146

who were under ART treatment with CD4+ T-cell counts over 200 per ml, or those from healthy

147

individuals, followed by the KSHV infection assays. HIV+ saliva EVs considerably enhanced

148

KSHV infection compared to HIV- saliva EVs in primary HOECs (Fig 2F and 2G). Collectively,

149

these results demonstrate that HIV+ saliva EVs indeed promote KSHV infection in oral

150

epithelial cells.

151
152

HIV+ saliva EVs stimulate KSHV infection and transmission in 3-D culture models of oral

153

mucosa. The oral mucosa is the first target of KSHV infection once the virus is in the oral cavity

154

[6,7,8,9]. To evaluate the initial infection process of oral mucosa by KSHV, we created the 3-

155

dimentional (3-D) organotypic culture by using OKF6/TERT2 cells as described previously [35]

156

(Fig 3A), followed by KSHV infection. KSHV infected all layers of cells of the 3-D cultures of

157

OKF6/TERT2 cells in the presence of HIV+ EVs from J1.1 T cells; however, the infection was

158

barely detected in the presence of Jurkat cell EVs (Fig 3B). Further, we used 3-D cultured oral

159

buccal mucosal tissues consisting of primary human oral epithelial cells (MatTek Co., Ashland,

160

MA) (Fig. 3A, lower panel). EVs from HIV+ J1.1 T cells increased expression of KSHV LANA

161

protein (Fig 3C, arrowheads) and GFP (Fig 3C, arrows) upon KSHV infection in the mucosal

162

tissues and cells in the basal layers compared with HIV- EVs from Jurkat cells. Quantification of

163

Fig 3C demonstrated that HIV+ J1.1 T-cell EVs significantly increased KSHV-infected LANA-

164

expressing cells compared to HIV- Jurkat T-cells EVs (Fig 3D). Our findings suggested that

165

HIV+ EVs were able to facilitate KSHV transmission through oral mucosa.

166
167

HIV transactivation element RNA (TAR) is critical for promoting KSHV infection. We

168

suspected that HIV-specific EV cargo components were responsible for HIV+ EV-enhanced

169

KSHV infection in oral epithelial cells. Latently HIV-infected J1.1 T-cell EVs do not contain

170

HIV-1 viral particles, although these EVs have viral proteins such as Gag and the precursor form

171

of Env protein (p160) [24]. To determine if HIV+ EVs contained viral proteins, such as Tat and

172

Nef that are known to contribute to cellular functions [36,37], we performed immunoblot on total

173

EV proteins isolated from latently HIV-infected J1.1 cells and the HIV+ Jurkat clone C22G cell

174

line that contains a disruptive HIV tat mutant and nef deletion [38]. While the whole protein

175

lysates of HIV-infected J1.1 cells contained Tat and Nef proteins, EVs from J1.1 and C22G cells

176

did not produce the HIV proteins (Fig 4A), suggesting that the HIV-associated proteins might

177

not play a major role in promoting KSHV infection. We have reported that EVs from both J1.1

178

and C22G cell lines contain HIV TAR RNA, which is required for HIV+ EV-enhanced

179

proliferation of cancer cells [26]. HIV+ saliva EVs also contained TAR RNA (Fig 2B).

180

Therefore, we postulated that the TAR RNA-bearing EVs contributed to increase KSHV

181

infection in oral epithelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we treated OKF6/TERT2 cells with EVs

182

derived from J1.1 and C22G cells, respectively, followed by KSHV infection. HIV+ EVs from

183

both J1.1 and C22G cell lines promoted KSHV infectivity in OKF6/TERT2 cells as shown by

184

GFP flow cytometry (Fig 4B), suggesting that the TAR RNA contributed to HIV+ EV-enhanced

185

KSHV infectivity. HIV TAR RNA can directly induce expression of pro-oncogenes and

186

proliferation of cancer cells and the pro-tumor effect of TAR RNA requires the bulge-loop

187

structure [39] of the molecule [26]. To determine whether the bulge-loop structure of the TAR

188

RNA affected KSHV infection, we transfected OKF6/TERT2 cells with a TAR RNA mutant

189

containing 5 nucleotide replacements in bulge and loop sequences [26] and found that, while the

190

wild type TAR RNA promoted KSHV infection in oral epithelial cells, the mutant TAR RNA

191

failed to affect KSHV infection (Fig 4C, TAR vs. mut TAR). In addition, the RNA aptamer R06,

192

which is complementary to the TAR apical region and blocks TAR function without disrupting

193

the secondary structure of TAR [40], blocked TAR RNA-enhanced KSHV infection in

194

OKF6/TERT2 cells (Fig 4C, TAR+R06). However, a scrambled aptamer [26] did not

195

significantly change TAR RNA-induced KSHV infectivity (Fig 4C, TAR+scrb). These results

196

indicate that the bulge-loop region of TAR RNA is critical for its function associated with the

197

enhancement of KSHV infection in oral epithelial cells by TAR RNA-bearing EVs.

198
199

HIV-associated EVs promote KSHV infectivity in an EGFR-dependent fashion. We have reported

200

that EVs released from HIV-infected T cells and purified from plasma of HIV-positive patients

201

stimulate proliferation of HNSCC and lung cancer cells in an EGFR-dependent manner through

202

phosphorylation of ERK1/2 [26]. We reasoned that HIV+ EVs might promote KSHV infection

203

in oral epithelial cells via the similar mechanism. Indeed, treatment of OKF6/TERT2 cells with

204

cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks ligand binding to EGFR, inhibited KSHV

205

infection in OKF6/TERT2 cells as shown by reduced numbers of GFP+ cells in the culture (S3

206

Fig, HIV+ J1.1 EVs vs. +cetuximab). The inhibitory effect of cetuximab on HIV+ EV-enhanced

207

KSHV infection in OKF6/TERT2 cells was also determined by flow cytometry (Fig 5A). To

208

determine whether viral proteins defining KSHV productive infection were affected by inhibition

209

of EGFR, we treated OKF6/TERT2 cells with cetuximab and AG1478, a selective inhibitor of

210

EGFR phosphorylation [41], followed by KSHV infection assays in the presence and absence of

211

HIV+ EVs. HIV+ EVs enhanced expression of viral LANA and K8 proteins, an early viral

212

protein encoded by open reading frame K8 to regulate viral and host cell transcription [42,43].

213

However, expression of the viral proteins was blocked by cetuximab and AG1478 (Fig 5B).

214

Cetuximab also blocked HIV+ EV-enhanced KSHV infection in primary oral epithelial cells (Fig

215

5C). To determine whether inhibition of EGFR affected KSHV infection promoted by HIV+

216

saliva EVs in oral mucosal tissues, we treated the 3-D oral mucosal tissues with cetuximab,

217

followed by KSHV infection in the presence of HIV+ saliva EVs. While HIV+ saliva EVs

218

stimulated KSHV infection in oral mucosal tissues, cetuximab blocked the pro-infection effect of

219

HIV+ saliva EVs in the tissues (Fig 5D). Our findings indicate that blocking EGFR was able to

220

inhibit KSHV infection mediated by HIV+ EVs in the oral cavity.

221
222

HIV-associated EVs stimulate p38 MAPK signaling through EGFR. We have reported that

223

HIV+ EVs induce phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in an EGFR-dependent manner without causing

224

activation of the receptor in cancer cells [26]. To determine if HIV+ EVs contribute to activation

225

of EGFR and its down-stream effector kinases, we treated OKF6/TERT2 cells and HOECs with

226

EVs isolated from HIV+ J1.1 T cells and control Jurkat cells, respectively. Treatment of

227

OKF6/TERT2 cells with HIV+ EVs for 10 min induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, a

228

process was blocked by cetuximab and AG1478 (Fig 6A). Similarly, HIV+ EVs induced

229

phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but not ERK1/2, in HOECs (Fig 6B). However, HIV+ EVs

230

failed to phosphorylate EGFR at tyrosine residuals 1068 (Y1068) and Y1173 in OKF6/TERT2

231

cells and HOECs, while EGF induced phosphorylation of EGFR at Y1068 and Y1173 as well as

232

phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in OKF6/TERT cells and HOECs, indicating that

233

the non-cancerous oral epithelial cells responded to EGF signaling (Fig 6A and 6B). In addition,

234

HIV+ EVs and EGF failed to phosphorylate STAT3, a downstream effector in the EGFR

235

signaling [44,45]. Our findings suggested that HIV+ EVs enhanced KSHV infection in an

236

EGFR-dependent manner possibly through activation of the EGFR/p38 signaling in oral

237

epithelial cells.

239
240

Discussion
HIV-infection is essential for KSHV co-infection, transmission, and its progression to

241

malignancies [46]. In people living with HIV/AIDS, co-infection with KSHV is much more

242

likely to lead to the development of KS and other KSHV-associated diseases [47,48,49]. The

243

incidence rates of KSHV detection are more prevalent in the HIV-infected population than that

244

in the general population in a case control study [33]. In this report, we demonstrate that HIV+

245

EVs from the saliva of HIV-positive patients and culture medium of HIV-infected T cells

246

promote KSHV productive infection in oral epithelial cells cultured in both monolayer and 3-D

247

models, indicating that HIV+ EVs are capable of regulating the initial steps of KSHV infection

248

in the oral cavity. Saliva-mediated oral transmission of KSHV is considered as the most common

249

route for spreading among homosexual people through deep kissing and “mother to child”

250

transmission [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Because both saliva and peripheral blood samples [26] from HIV-

251

infected persons contain HIV+ EVs, our findings suggest that the in HIV seropositive people

252

bear higher risk for KSHV infection most likely through EVs in the body fluids.

253
254

It has been reported that oral microbial metabolites contribute to infection and lytic

255

activation of KSHV [50,51,52]. Supernatants of periodontopathic bacteria cultures induce KSHV

256

replication in BCBL-1, a latently infected KSHV-based lymphoma-derived cell line, and

257

infection in embryonic kidney epithelial cells, human oral epithelial cells and umbilical vein

258

endothelial cells [51,52]. The saliva of patients with severe periodontal disease contain high

259

levels of short chain fatty acids that stimulate lytic gene expression of KSHV in a dose-

260

dependent fashion in BCBL-1 cells [52]. These bacterial metabolic products can stimulate

261

KSHV replication in infected cells using different mechanisms [51,52]. However, it is not clear

262

whether these microbial metabolic products are responsible for KSHV infection in HIV-infected

263

persons in the oral cavity. Collectively, our findings and these previous reports denote that

264

multiple microbial/viral risk factor contribute to KSHV pathogenesis in the oral cavity.

265
266

We have reported that HIV+ EVs stimulate proliferation and proto-oncogene expression

267

of squamous cell carcinoma cells in an EGFR-dependent manner [26]. Similarly, EGFR is

268

critical for HIV+ EV-enhanced KSHV infectivity; blocking the receptor with a neutralizing

269

antibody effectively inhibits KSHV infection in primary and immortalized oral epithelial cells.

EGFR mediates HIV+ EV entry into target cells and participates in EV-induced signaling,

271

including phosphorylation of ERK1/2, in head and neck as well as lung cancer cells [26].

272

However, cancer cells lacking EGFR, such as B-cell lymphoma cells, do not respond to HIV+

273

EVs [26]. Our results suggest that HIV+ EVs specifically promote KSHV infectivity through

274

EGFR in epithelial cells in the oral cavity.

276

EVs from plasma of HIV-infected people and culture supernatants of HIV-infected T

277

cells contain HIV TAR RNA in vast excess over all viral mRNAs [24,26]. In patients with

278

virtually undetectable virion levels, TAR RNA can still be found in blood EVs [27]. Our results

279

show that HIV+ saliva EVs contained TAR RNA and that synthetic TAR RNA considerably

280

increases KSHV infection in oral epithelial cells. Several reports have shown that the HIV TAR

281

RNA is a critical component of the HIV+ EV cargo and induces expression of proinflammatory

282

cytokines and proto-oncogenes in primary human macrophages and head and neck cancer cells,

283

respectively [24,26,27]. Synthetic TAR RNA alone can stimulate proliferation and migration of

284

head and neck cancer cells [26]. The mutant TAR RNA with 5-nucleotide substitutions in the

285

bulge and loop sequences fails to induce gene expression in head and neck cancer cells [26].

286

Similarly, our results demonstrate that the same TAR RNA mutant cannot enhance KSHV

287

infection in oral epithelial cells. In addition, the R06 nucleotide aptamer, which creates an

288

imperfect hairpin to complement to the entire TAR loop to block the function of TAR RNA [40],

289

blocks TAR RNA-induced KSHV infection in oral epithelial cells. The R06 aptamer and its

290

derivatives are able to reduce HIV-1 infection and inhibit the viral transcription [53,54]. Kolb et

291

al. have reported that the replication of HIV-1 and the activity of β-galactosidase under the

292

control of the HIV-1 5'LTR were reduced in cells expressing the nucleolar R06 transcript [53],

293

suggesting the antiviral activity of the nucleotide aptamer. Our results implicate that the R06

294

RNA aptamer and its functional derivatives can be potentially developed as a strategy for

295

controlling co-infection of the herpesvirus in the HIV-infected population.

296
297
298

We have reported that HIV+ EVs activate the ERK1/2 singling through the EGFR-TLR3
axis to induce proto-oncogene expression and proliferation of head neck and lung cancer cells

299

[26]. However, our data show that HIV+ EVs specifically activate the MAPK p38, but not

300

ERK1/2, through EGFR without inducing phosphorylation of the receptor in non-cancerous oral

301

epithelial cells. Inhibition of the catalytic activity of the phosphorylated p38 blocks KSHV

302

reactivation, possibly through reduction in a global H3 acetylation and phosphorylation [55].

303

Various chromatin-silencing mechanisms, including histone deacetylation, repressive histone

304

methylation, and DNA methylation, lead to silence of the genomes of herpesviruses and HIV

305

during latency [56]. Multiple short chain fatty acids, including butyric acid, propionic acid,

306

isovaleric acid, and isobutyric acid, inhibit class-1/2 histone deacetylases (HDACs) for histone

307

hyperacetylation, resulting in expression of genes associated with the fate of KSHV infection and

308

viral reactivation [57,58,59]. The epigenetic modifications, particularly acetylation of histones,

309

are required for maintenance of KSHV latency in classic and AIDS-associated KS tissues [59].

310

Taken together, our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying HIV-specific

311

components and co-infection of KSHV in people living with HIV/AIDS through the oral cavity.

312

In addition, targeting the HIV TAR RNA and EGFR of oral epithelial cells may serve as novel

313

approaches to control KSHV infection in the HIV-infected population.

323

The J1.1 cell line was obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program. C22G cells were obtained

324

from Dr. Karn (Case Western Reserve University). Jurkat cells were purchased from American

325

Type Culture Collection (TIB-152, ATCC, Manassas, VA). These cells were maintained in

326

RPMI1640 medium (HyClone Lab., Inc., Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted

327

FBS, which was prepared by ultracentrifugation of FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,

328

MA) at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C [26], followed by collecting supernatants without disturbing

329

the pellet. Primary human oral epithelial cells (HOECs) were isolated from healthy patients who

330

underwent third-molar extraction at School of Dental Medicine as previously described [60].

331

HOECs and immortalized OKF6/TERT2 human oral keratinocytes were maintained as

332

previously described [31,61]. EpiOral™ oral mucosal tissues were purchased from MatTek Co.

333

(Ashland, MA), which consist of normal human oral keratinocytes that are differentiated into

334

tissues with a non-cornified, buccal phenotype. The 3-D organotypic cultures were constructed

335

following previously published protocols by Dongari-Bagtzoglou and Kashleva [35]. Briefly,

336

collagen gel cushion was prepared on ice from rat-tail type I collagen (Cat# Corning 354249,

337

Thermo-Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS in DMEM and antibiotics. Fibroblast gel layer was

338

prepared by mixing 1 ml of NIH3T3 cells with the collagen gel as mentioned above. Culture

339

inserts containing gel cushion and fibroblast gel layer were cultured for 4 day, followed by

340

addition of OKF6/TERT6 cells to the center of the insert and cultured for 3 days. These inserts

341

were then lifted and cultured in airlifting medium for 14 days with change of the medium every

342

other day.

344

Preparation of KSHV virions and EVs

345

EVs were prepared from cell supernatants by differential ultracentrifugation with filtration steps

346

[26]. Briefly, cell culture media were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min to remove cells, followed

347

by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min to remove any possible apoptotic bodies and large cell

348

debris. EVs were precipitated at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C (50.2Ti rotor, Beckman Coulter,

349

Brea, CA) and suspended in PBS. Isolated EVs were quantified using the acetylcholinesterase

350

(AChE) assay system [26] (System Biosci. Inc/SBI, Palo Alta, CA) and maintained at -80 °C in

351

DMEM for later use. To purify EVs from saliva, 2 ml of saliva was centrifuged at 400 × g for 15

352

min to remove cell contaminants. After centrifugation at 11,000× g for 10 min, saliva EVs were

353

pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C (Optima™ Max-XP, Beckman

354

Coulter). The EVs were washed in 2 ml PBS and pelleted again at 100,000 × g for 90 min and

355

suspended in PBS. Saliva EVs were quantified using BCA assays to measure total EV proteins

356

following the manufacture’s protocol (SBI).

357
358

Flow cytometry analysis

359

OKF6/TERT or HOECs were washed 3 times with PBS, then suspended in 100 µl of PBS. Flow

360

cytometric analysis was performed by Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) on FACSAria Flow

361

Cytometer (BD Biosciences). FACS data was analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc.).

362
363

RT-PCR and immunoblot

364

Total RNA was isolated and purified using High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche) according to

365

the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA (High-

366

Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription, Applied Biosystems). Regular PCR analysis was

367

performed using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2x Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and detected

368

by the T100™ Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). Sequences of primers are listed in SI Appendix table

369

S1. For immunoblotting, total EV proteins were purified using the Total Exosome RNA &

370

Protein Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher) following the manufacturer’s instructions. To prepare total

371

cellular proteins, cells were washed with PBS and then cellular lysates were obtained by adding

372

300 µl of RIPA Lysis and Extraction Buffer (ThermoFisher). Protein lysates were separated by

373

SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PVDF, Merck

Immunofluorescence microscopy

379

Immunofluorescence microscopy of 3-D cultures were performed as previously described [62]

380

with minor modifications. Briefly, each section (5 µm) was de-paraffinized 3 times in Clear-

381

Rite™ 3 and hydrated with 100% Alcohol followed by 95% Alcohol. Samples were blocked

382

with 10% donkey serum at room temperature for 1 hr. Each section was incubated with the

383

primary antibody at 4°C overnight. After washing in PBS, sections were stained with the

384

appropriate AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibody to the species of the primary antibody.

385

Sections were then mounted with the VECTASHIELD Fluorescent Mounting Media (Vector Lab

386

Inc., Burlingame, CA) containing DAPI to visualize nuclei. Immunofluorescent images were

387

generated using AMG EVOS FL digital inverted fluorescence microscope (AMG, Mill Creek,

388

WA). Confocal images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP8 system (Leica Microsystems) using

389

a 63×/1.4 objective at a pixel size of 90 nm. Channels were acquired sequentially by line. For

390

immunocytochemistry, cells on 8 well culture slide were fixed with 100% methanol at -20°C for

391

20 minutes followed by permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were then

392

stained with the primary antibody followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies.

393

Fluorescent images were taken as described above. Antibodies for immunofluorescence

394

microscopy are listed in S5 Table.
