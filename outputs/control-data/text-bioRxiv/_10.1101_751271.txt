Abstract

32

Background. Global positioning systems (GPS) and altimeters are increasingly used to monitor

33

vertical space use by aerial species, a key aspect of their niche that we need to know to understand

34

their ecology and conservation needs, and to manage our own use of the airspace. However, there

35

are various sources of error in flight height data (”height” above ground, as opposed to “altitude”

36

above a reference like the sea level): vertical error from the devices themselves, error in the ground

37

elevation below the tracked animals, and error in the horizontal position of the animals and thus the

38

predicted ground elevation below them.

39

Methods. We used controlled field trials, simulations, and the reanalysis of raptor case studies with

40

state-space models to illustrate the effect of improper error management.

41

Results. Errors of a magnitude of 20 meters appear in benign conditions (expected to be larger in

42

more challenging context). These errors distort the shape of the distribution of flight heights, inflate

43

the variance in flight height, bias behavioural state assignments, correlations with environmental

44

covariates, and airspace management recommendations. Improper data filters such as removing all

45

negative recorded flight height records introduce several biases in the remaining dataset, and

46

preclude the opportunity to leverage unambiguous errors to help with model fitting. Analyses that

47

ignore the variance around the mean flight height, e.g., those based on linear models of flight height,

48

and those that ignore the variance inflation caused by telemetry errors, lead to incorrect inferences.

49

Conclusion. The state-space modelling framework, now in widespread use by ecologists and

50

increasingly often automatically implemented within on-board GPS data processing algorithms,

51

makes it possible to fit flight models directly to raw flight height records, with minimal data pre-

52

selection, and to analyse the full distribution of flight heights, not just the mean. In addition to basic

53

research about aerial niches, behaviour quantification, and environmental interactions, we highlight

54

the applied relevance of our recommendations for airspace management and the conservation of

55

aerial wildlife.

Introduction

58

Describing the distribution of animals in environmental space is fundamental to understanding their

59

resource requirements, cognitive processes, energetic strategies, and ecological characteristics. The

60

distribution of animals in horizontal space has dominated ecological studies (Nathan et al. 2008),

61

however the vertical dimension is also important for flying animals, and for that matter also diving

62

and tree-climbing animals (Weimerskirch et al. 2005, Kunz et al. 2007, Bishop et al. 2015, Liechti et al.

63

2018). For example, flight height data could help documenting the vertical niche and community

64

ecology of aerial foragers (Arlettaz et al. 1997, Siemers and Schnitzler 2004). Flight height data

65

quantify the behaviour of flying animals and their flight strategies (Pirotta et al. 2018, Murgatroyd et

66

al. 2018), and their relationships with environmental factors (e.g., Péron et al. 2017). From an applied

67

perspective, we need an accurate, error-free description of the distribution of birds and other

68

animals in the aerosphere to avoid collisions with man-made structures, which is key to aircraft

69

safety and animal conservation, in the current context of increasing human encroachment into the

70

airspace (Lambertucci et al. 2015, Davy et al. 2017).

71

However, monitoring vertical airspace use by wildlife remains challenging. Ground-based surveys are

72

limited in their field of vision and time window. Airborne monitoring (e.g., from glider planes) is

73

logistically challenging and constrained by weather conditions. Radar-based methodologies are not

74

usually specific enough to assign records to species (but see Zaugg et al. 2008, Dokter et al. 2013).

75

Animal-borne tracking methodologies such as global positioning systems (GPS) and altimeters have

76

therefore become popular to monitor flying species (López-López 2016). They record data even when

77

the animals are out of sight for ground-based observers, over extensive, potentially uninterrupted

78

periods of time, and with no uncertainty about which species or individuals are being monitored. For

79

example, we can record raptors soaring over the high sea at night (Duriez et al. 2018). However, the

80

data that GPS and altimeters record are not error-free (D’Eon et al. 2002, Frair et al. 2004, Jerde and

81

Visscher 2005, Brost et al. 2015). Errors are particularly evident in the vertical axis because there are

82

unpassable barriers, e.g., the ground. Usually, a few unambiguously erroneous positions are

83

recorded beyond these barriers (Katzner et al. 2012, Ross-Smith et al. 2016, Weimerskirch et al.

84

2016, Péron et al. 2017, Krone and Treu 2018, Roeleke et al. 2018).

85

Most of the research into ways to deal with sampling errors in positioning data has focused on

86

horizontal animal movement (Freitas et al. 2008, Albertsen et al. 2015, Brost et al. 2015, Fleming et

87

al. 2016). There is very little guidance for ecologists about the challenges specific to vertical space

88

use data (Poessel et al. 2018). Many practitioners consider that vertical movement data need to be

89

“filtered” before analysis, i.e., they discard some records before proceeding with the analysis. They

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/751271; this version posted September 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

90

may discard records that are too far from preceding ones (as often done for horizontal data; Freitas

91

et al., 2008), too far beyond impassable barriers (Katzner et al. 2012, Krone and Treu 2018), or

92

obtained from an unreliable configuration of the GPS satellite network (Poessel et al., 2018). Instead

93

of discarding the more erroneous records, researchers have also sometimes chosen to reset them to

94

plausible values (Weimerskirch et al. 2016, Roeleke et al. 2018). However, when applied improperly,

95

such filters can have undesirable consequences. We start by reviewing the sources of error in GPS

96

and altimeter flight height data (Part 1). In Part 2, we reanalyse case studies into the flight height of

97

three raptor species (Péron et al. 2017), and complement them with novel data from controlled field

98

trials and from simulations, in order to illustrate the stakes of proper error-handling in vertical

99

airspace use data.

100

102

Part 1: Review of the sources of error in flight height data
from GPS and altimeters

103

Throughout we refer to flight height h, which is the distance to the ground below the bird, different

104

from flight altitude z. The flight altitude denotes the distance to a reference altitude, often the

105

ellipsoid, i.e., a geometrically perfect (but simplistic) model of the sea level. Alternatively, some GPS

106

units may provide the altitude relative to the empirical sea level measured at a reference point over

107

a reference period (e.g., in France the “NGF-IGN 1969” norm means that altitude is measured

108

relative to the mean sea level in the port of Marseille between 1884 and 1896), or relative to the

109

geoid, which is a model of the sea level if it was only influenced by the local gravitational field and

110

the rotation of the Earth (Fowler 2005). There are databases and simple formulae to convert from

111

one system of reference to another, but this nevertheless represents a first potential source of error

112

in flight height data.

113

Flight height above the ground is computed as

114

altitude predicted by a digital elevation model (DEM) at the recorded horizontal position , , in

115

the same system of reference as z. Errors in h can then be caused by errors in any of the three

116

components: , ஽ாெ , or ,  (Fig. 1). Importantly, depending on the application, researchers might

117

want to study z not h (Pirotta et al. 2018, Murgatroyd et al. 2018). In the list below, sources of error

118

#3-#5 do not influence z.

119

1. Error in  when  is given by a GPS.

120

If recorded by a GPS, z is affected by the “user equivalent range error” (UERE) and the “vertical

121

dilution of precision” (VDOP) (Parkinson and Spilker 1996, Sanz Subirana et al. 2013).

101

 – ஽ாெ , , where ஽ாெ ,  is the ground

122

The UERE stems from diffusion and diffraction in the atmosphere, reflection from obstacles, and

123

receiver noise (Parkinson and Spilker 1996, Sanz Subirana et al. 2013). The acronym UERE usually

124

directly refers to the root mean squared error, but here we will use the notation σ୙୉ୖ୉ instead.

125

σ୙୉ୖ୉ is usually in the order of a few meters and considered constant over time for a given device.

126

Some GPS manufacturers specify the horizontal σ୙୉ୖ୉ , or alternatively it can be estimated from the

127

data (Johnson et al. 2008). The σ୙୉ୖ୉ is however reputedly larger in the vertical axis than the

128

horizontal axes (D’Eon et al. 2002, Bouten et al. 2013), meaning that manufacturer-provided σ୙୉ୖ୉

129

should be considered conservative for vertical applications and should be used with appropriate

130

caution.

131

The vertical position dilution of precision factor (VDOP) quantifies the effect of changes in the size

132

and spatial configuration of the available satellite network on the precision of GPS records (Parkinson

133

& Spilker, 1996; Sanz Subirana et al., 2013; Fig. A1). The more satellites are available and the more

134

evenly spread apart they are, the more reliable the positioning is. Some GPS manufacturers do

135

provide a VDOP value for each record, but many only provide a more generic DOP value.

136

When σ୙୉ୖ୉ and VDOP are known, the error-generating process can then be approximated by a

137

Gaussian process with time-varying standard deviation σ୸ t  VDOPt · σ୙୉ୖ୉ (Eq. 6.45 in Sanz

138

Subirana et al., 2013). Therefore, the DOP is not a direct index of precision. The spread of the error

139

distribution increases with the DOP, but the error on any given record is stochastic. The DOP is

140

therefore not intended to be used as a data filter (e.g., discard any data with DOP above a given

141

threshold), but instead it should be used to model the error-generating process.

142
143

2. Error in  when  is given by an altimeter

144

If recorded using an altimeter,  is computed from the barometric pressure, using the formula

145

   ·  · ோாி ⁄ (Monaldo et al. 1986, Crocker and Jackson 2018). c is a calibration constant

146

that mostly depends on the composition of the air (e.g., percentage of vapour) and on the

147

gravitational field. T is the air temperature in Kelvin, P is the air pressure, and PREF is the air pressure

148

at an elevation of reference (both pressures in mbar or in Pascal). However, this formula only holds

149

when the atmosphere is at equilibrium. Changes in temperature, pressure, and air composition, i.e.,

150

the weather, alter the link between z and P. These influences are difficult to control fully because one

151

would need to measure the weather variables both where the bird is, and at the reference elevation

152

immediately below the bird. In other words, altimeters can be more accurate than GPS to monitor

153

flight height, but only over short periods of time when the weather can be considered constant and

154

the altimeter is calibrated for that weather. One should ideally regularly re-calibrate the altimeters

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/751271; this version posted September 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

155

using direct observations of flight height and accurate measures of PREF and T. Unfortunately, field

156

calibrations are rarely feasible in practice (but see Shepard et al., 2016; Borkenhagen et al., 2018).

157

The consequence is that altimeters are often miscalibrated. The degree of miscalibration depends

158

mostly on the weather. This generates temporally autocorrelation in the error time series. Over a

159

restricted time period, the error patterns are thus more akin to a bias (a systematic over- or under-

160

estimation of flight height) than to an error in the statistical sense of a zero-mean, identically and

161

independently distributed random process. Importantly, altimeter data still allow one to compute

162

the derivative of flight height, i.e., climb rate, because the amount of bias can be considered constant

163

over short periods of time. In Part 2.1, we will directly compare the errors from GPS and altimeters

164

using controlled field experiments.

165

3. GPS horizontal error.

166

,  is also affected by a user equivalent range error and a dilution of precision (Fig. 1). The

167

horizontal error in ,  can thus also be described as a Gaussian process with time-varying standard

168

deviation: ௫௬   1/√2 ·     · ௎ாோா . Note that we use here a horizontal dilution of

169

precision factor, HDOP. An often-overlooked consequence of errors in the horizontal position is that

170

they introduce flaws in the link to spatially-explicit environmental covariates (Hays et al. 2001,

171

Bradshaw et al. 2007). In particular, the ground elevation ஽ாெ is extracted from a location , 

172

that is slightly different from the true location (Katzner et al. 2012). If the terrain is very rough, then

173

the ground elevation at the recorded location ,  may be significantly different from the ground

174

elevation below the actual location of the bird. In Part 2.2 we will use simulations to quantify the

175

influence of horizontal errors.

176

4. Interpolation error in ஽ாெ .

177

஽ாெ is interpolated from discrete ground elevation measurements (Gorokhovich and Voustianiouk

178

2006, Januchowski et al. 2010). The ground elevation is measured at a few select locations, but it is

179

interpolated between them. The result of the interpolation is then rasterized at a set resolution, and

180

the result is the DEM. This process can be quite imprecise (Gorokhovich and Voustianiouk 2006,

181

Januchowski et al. 2010). At a cliff, for example, the ground elevation may drop by several hundred

182

meters within a single pixel of the DEM.

183

5. Errors in DEM base data.

184

The original measurements from which DEMs are interpolated are not necessarily error free either.

185

These errors are assumed small relative to the other sources, however, there is, to our knowledge,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/751271; this version posted September 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

186

not much information available about the base datasets from which DEM are interpolated and their

187

precision.

188

190

Part 2: Field trials, simulations, and reanalysis of raptor
data

191

Material and Methods

192

Controlled field trials

193

To quantify the magnitude of the vertical error in altimeters and GPS devices, we conducted three

194

controlled trial experiments.

195

First, we attached an “Ornitrack 25” GPS-altimeter unit (Ornitela) to a drone. We then flew the drone

196

above the rooftop of the Max-Planck institute in Radolfzell, Germany at heights ranging from 0

197

(drone landed on the rooftop) to 90m. We conducted 6 flight sessions over two days, each lasting

198

between 15 and 140min, collecting one record every ten minutes for a total of 30 records. We also

199

monitored the air pressure and temperature on the rooftop, which we used to recalibrate the

200

altimeter post-hoc. Lastly, the drone carried a separate, on-board, altimeter.

201

In a second, separate experiment, we attached two “Gipsy 5” GPS units (Technosmart) to an ultra-

202

light aircraft, with a vertical distance of 1.8m between the two units. We then flew the aircraft near

203

Radolfzell while the two units simultaneously tracked its flight height, collecting one record per

204

second for a total of 11.5 hours over 5 days.

205

Third, we compared the vertical positions recorded by 4 different units from 3 different

206

manufacturers: Technosmart (AxyTrek and Gipsy 5), Microwave (GPS-GSM 20-70), and Ornitela (GPS-

207

GSM Ornitrack 85). We (RG and OD) carried these units to 21 known geodesic points, of which the

208

altitude was precisely documented by the French National Geographic Institute. The units recorded

209

their position once every minute for a total of 894, 934, 560, and 563 data points, keeping only the

210

unit * location combinations that yielded more than 25 fixes. We computed the bias and root mean

211

squared error of the vertical measurement by comparing these data to the actual, known altitudes of

212

the geodesic points. Importantly, the manufacturers do not use the same reference to compute the

213

altitude: Microwave uses the geoid (WGS 84 EGM-96 norm), whereas the others use the mean sea

214

level (assumed to correspond to the local reference, meaning the NGF-IGN 1969 norm, but sea

215

below). We expressed all altitudes in the same norm before computing biases and errors, and

216

accounted for sampling effort (number of fixes) and location when comparing the performance of

217

different units.

218

Simulations of flight tracks

219

We simulated flight tracks that followed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes (Dunn and Gipson 1977). This

220

is a class of continuous-time stochastic models, which is not specific to vertical movement or even to

221

movement (Dunn and Gipson 1977). In the case of vertical movement, the parameters of the

222

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes control the mean flight height, the variance in flight height, and the

223

temporal autocorrelation in the flight height time series. We transformed the raw Ornstein-

224

Uhlenbeck simulations using an atanh link as described by Péron et al. (2017) to enforce positive

225

flight height. The time unit was arbitrary. An attractive feature of simulations in the context of this

226

study is that we know both the true flight height and the recorded flight height, which is the true

227

flight height plus an independent and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian error.

228

Simulations of synthetic landscapes

229

The objective was to quantify the influence of horizontal errors. We generated synthetic landscapes

230

of varying complexity and roughness (Fig. A2). We then transposed the flight track of a lesser kestrel

231

Falco naumanni over these synthetic landscapes. The individual originally flew over extremely flat

232

terrain (the Crau steppe in France). The data (Pilard and OD, unpublished) were collected every 3

233

minutes using a Gipsy 5 GPS unit from Technosmart, and processed through the state-space model of

234

Péron et al. (2017) to account for real sampling errors before use. We then added simulated random

235

telemetry noise of controlled standard deviation.

236

Raptor case studies

237

We reanalysed the data from Péron et al. (2017), where the field procedure, data selection, and data

238

analysis procedures are described in full. Briefly, we studied three species of large soaring raptors:

239

Andean condors Vultur gryphus (five juveniles, 1,692 individual.days of monitoring, 15 minute

240

interval), Griffon vultures Gyps fulvus (eight adults, 2,697 individual.days, 1-5 minute interval), and

241

Golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos (six adults, 3,103 individual.days, 6-10 minute interval). After

242

applying the analytical procedure, for each data point, we could compare the corrected position, an

243

estimate of the true position, to the recorded position, which was affected by the sources of errors

244

we listed in Part 1.

245

We selected the period between 11:00 and 15:00, which concentrates condor activity and therefore

246

flight time, and discarded other records. For the vultures, we selected the period between 09:00 and

247

16:00. For the eagles, we selected the period between 08:00 and 17:00 and, because a lot of time is

248

spent motionless in this species even during their core activity period, we further removed all the

249

records that were less than 15 meters from the previous record. We acknowledge the arbitrary

250

nature of this data selection and emphasize that it is not necessary or even recommended to apply

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/751271; this version posted September 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

251

such filters before analysis. We however stress that in the context of the present study, the case

252

studies perform an illustrative function, meaning that we use them to highlight the effect of

253

improper error-handling, at least during the particular time periods that we selected for analysis

254

because we consider them relevant for biological inference, and that the same analytical procedures

255

can indiscriminately be applied to other time frames.

256

Collision risk

257

In several instances, we will illustrate the potential effect of improper data-handling on management

258

recommendations by estimating the risk of collision with wind turbines as the proportion of records

259

between 60 and 180m above ground (assuming no behavioural adjustment in the presence of wind

260

turbines). Collision risk estimated from GPS tracks is increasingly used to make recommendations

261

about the choice of locations for new turbines, or to schedule the operation of existing ones. We

262

expected that the estimated collision risk would depend on flight parameters (mean flight height,

263

variance in flight height), on the magnitude of errors, and on error-handling. For example, a large

264

variance in flight height might lead to a high collision risk even if the mean flight height is beyond the

265

collision zone. Improperly handled errors may lead to positions being erroneously recorded in the

266

collision zone when the birds actually flew outside of it, and vice versa. The same type of thinking

267

could be applied to other types of collision risk, e.g., antennas, utility lines, buildings with bay

268

windows, except that the collision zone would be at a different height.

269

Part 2.1: The magnitude of vertical errors in GPS and altimeters

270

During the first controlled field trial (with the drone), DOP values between 1.2 and 1.6 indicated that

271

the configuration of the satellite network was reliable throughout. Nevertheless, 6.7% of the GPS

272

flight height records were below the rooftop height, i.e., obviously erroneous. For the altimeter, with

273

default settings, 10% of the records were below the rooftop height. The default settings of the

274

altimeter therefore did not correspond to the atmospheric conditions during the experiment. The

275

standard deviation of the difference between the recalibrated altimetry and the GPS data was 22m,

276

between the recalibrated altimetry and default-setting altimetry it was 14m, and between the

277

recalibrated altimetry and the on-board drone altimeter it was 19m. This means that, with default

278

settings, the altimeters had approximately the same precision as the GPS.

279

During the second controlled field trial (with two GPS units attached to the same aircraft), in 35% of

280

cases, the lower unit was erroneously recorded above the higher unit. The standard deviation of the

281

difference between the height recorded by the two units was 7.1m. The highest of the two units

282

recorded 3% of negative flight heights. The lowest unit recorded 13% of negative flight heights.

283

During the third controlled field trial (with GPS units carried to a geodesic point of precisely known

284

altitude), the mean absolute bias of the vertical measurement was 27m on average across units and

285

locations. The root mean squared error ranged from 14m to 42m depending on the unit, with a small

286

effect of location. However, the within-session standard deviation ranged only to 28m, suggesting

287

that a bias in the sea level reference point (probably incorrectly assumed to follow the French norm)

288

inflated the RMSE. The average bias ranged between -17m and +12m depending on the unit, after

289

correcting for significant location effect, but without effect of altitude. This means that different

290

brands of GPS unit yield different rate of error in their altitude measurements, which can impair the

291

comparison of datasets collected by different units. Further investigation or communication with

292

manufacturers should decipher whether this stems from different fix acquisition procedures (e.g.,

293

satellite detection) or different post-processing algorithms, and should also make clear which sea

294

level reference point different manufacturers are using.

295

These controlled field trials, along with other similar reports (Bouten et al., 2013; Ross-Smith et al.,

296

2016), highlight that even in benign conditions, GPS and altimeter data are sufficiently error-prone to

297

tamper with ecological inference in many cases (range of the standard deviation of the error: 4 –

298

50m). The issue is only suspected to be more acute in operational conditions when the DOP is larger,

299

the terrain rougher, the weather more variable, and there are more obstacles to signal diffusion than

300

in controlled field trials. Furthermore, the rate of error depended on the brand of the unit and on the

301

location, which can be of importance when comparing across studies.

302

Part 2.2: Horizontal errors can cause vertical errors

303

In the synthetic landscape simulations, the frequency of negative flight height records increased with

304

the standard deviation of both the horizontal and vertical telemetry error (Fig. A2a), and with the

305

landscape roughness and complexity (Fig. A2b). However, the various sources of errors acted in a

306

multiplicative way, so that even when the telemetry noise was small (SD of 1m), the error in h could

307

be large (SD of 20m; Fig. A2c; darkest grey curve). Perhaps unexpectedly, when the horizontal error

308

was large, the error in the height above ground tended to be independent of the vertical error in the

309

GPS (on average across all simulations; Fig. A2c; lightest grey curve). This means that the effect of the

310

horizontal error in the GPS can supersede the effect of the vertical error, if the terrain is rough. Even

311

in the absence of any vertical error, the horizontal error was indeed routinely sufficient to cause 10-

312

20% of the data points to be below ground (Fig. A2a).

313

Part. 2.3: Errors inflate the recorded variance in flight height

314

In the simulations of flight tracks, errors in h inflated the variance in the distribution of recorded

315

flight heights, i.e., the variance in the true flight height was consistently lower than the variance in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/751271; this version posted September 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

316

the recorded flight height (Fig. 2). In the raptor case studies, we obtained the same result, with the

317

caveat that we did not access to the true flight height, but we could instead use the corrected flight

318

heights (Fig. 2).

319

Indeed, if the movement and error processes are independent, the total variance in flight height is

320

theoretically exactly the sum of the movement and sampling variances (e.g, Auger-Méthé et al.,

321

2016; see also Gould & Nichols, 1998 and references therein). If the movement and error processes

322

are not independent, the total variance is still larger than the movement variance. Yet, what we need

323

for biological inference is the movement variance. In a naïve analysis of the raptor case studies that

324

would confound telemetry errors with rapid movements, the birds would therefore have appeared

325

more vertically mobile and with a more spread-out distribution in the aerosphere than they actually

326

were. This type of issue is potentially quite widespread in movement ecology, e.g., in behavioural

327

assignment exercises that use movement variances (daily displacements, turning angles, etc.) to

328

determine the behavioural state of animals.

329
330

Part 2.4: Negative flight height records provide useful information

331

In this section we focus on negative records, i.e., unrealistically low records, but the same logic can

332

be applied to unrealistically high records. Negative flight height records are more likely to occur

333

when animals are near the ground, either perched or flying. If we remove the negative records

334

(Poessel et al. 2018), perching and low flight are under-sampled in the final dataset (Roeleke et al.

335

2018). To illustrate this point, we used a flight track from a migrating juvenile osprey (Pandion

336

haliaetus) as it crossed the sea between the Italian mainland and Corsica (Duriez et al. 2018). During

337

a portion of that sea crossing, its Ornitela GPS unit recorded flight heights that oscillated between -

338

2m and -7m below the sea level (Fig. A3, inset). The amplitude of the oscillation suggested that the

339

bird followed the swell of the waves. The complete sequence (Fig. A3) depicts a progressive loss of

340

altitude as the bird glided towards firm ground, and a period of active flapping flight (as per the

341

accelerometery record) very low above the waves once the bird had lost all of its accumulated

342

potential energy before reaching firm ground. These negative flight height records documented a

343

critical time period. First, the risk of having to make a sea landing were clearly much greater in the

344

few minutes when the osprey was flying low over the waves, compared to the rest of the sea

345

crossing when the bird was often soaring high (Duriez et al. 2018). In addition, when flying low, the

346

bird had no other choice than to flap and therefore expend energy; whereas when higher above the

347

sea, the bird had the option to soar and therefore spare energy. It is critical that negative flight

348

height records like these are maintained, even if, instead of a fully interpretable high-resolution

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/751271; this version posted September 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

349

sequence like in this example, there are just a few isolated negative flight height records in a low-

350

resolution dataset.

351

In addition, if we only kept the records with positive flight height, we would obtain a biased sample

352

of the distribution of flight height. Both in simulations and in the raptor case studies, discarding

353

negative flight height records led to the overestimation of the mean flight height in the remaining

354

dataset, the underestimation of the variance in flight height, the introduction of a right skew in the

355

distribution of flight height, and the overestimation of the collision risk (Fig. 3). The latter result was

356

because negative records mostly occurred when the bird was flying below the collision zone, and

357

thus removing negative records led to under-sample safe periods of time. Note that this particular

358

result pertains to the wind turbine application case only; in other types of collision risk, e.g., buildings

359

and utility lines, the collision zone starts closer to the ground.

360

The simulations nicely complemented the raptor case studies by 1) eliminating any debate about

361

whether the corrected flight heights in the raptor case studies were trustworthy or not (in the

362

simulations, the true flight heights are exactly known) and 2) increasing the range of flight

363

behaviours, since the raptors tended to exhibit lower percentage of time near the ground (in part

364

because we purposely tried to exclude time spent perched) and different distributions of the

365

sampling error. The amount of bias appeared highly dependent on the underlying flight behaviour

366

and error distribution, and therefore not easy to predict and account for without appropriate error-

367

handling methodology.

368

Additionally, there are many other major consequences of discarding negative flight heights. One is

369

the disruption of the expected balance of positive and negative errors in the remaining data.

370

Negative flight height records only arise when the error is negative, and so removing them

371

introduces a bias towards positive errors, thereby disrupting the shape of the distribution of errors in

372

the remaining data. Yet, we need the full range of errors to fit the models in Part 3. Another,

373

unrelated consequence is the disruption of the sampling schedule of the remaining data. Many

374

movement analyses are critically sensitive to the sampling schedule, and therefore their outcome will

375

not be the same after removing the negative records. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, negative

376

flight height records can help fit the models that separate the error and movement processes,

377

because they are unambiguously erroneous and can be informed as such in the model-fitting

378

procedure (cf. Part 3). Some authors have applied less stringent filters, such as removing only the

379

most negative flight height records and removing an equal amount of extremely positive flight height

380

records. While the effect on the remaining distribution, and on the balance of negative and positive

381

errors is supposedly weaker than if removing all of the negative records, we warn that the remaining

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/751271; this version posted September 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was
not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. It is made available

382

records are still affected by the same error process that generated the records that were deemed too

383

erroneous to keep, thus the issues in Part 2.3 still need to be addressed. In addition, these extremely

384

erroneous records are potentially the most informative regarding the shape of the error distribution

385

(cf. Part 3).

386
387
388

Part 2.5: The mean flight height is not sufficient to describe the
distribution of flight heights

389

Flight height datasets are often reduced to a single summary metric, the mean flight height and its

390

variation with environmental and individual covariates (Walter et al. 2012, Cleasby et al. 2015,

391

Poessel et al. 2018, Tikkanen et al. 2018, Balotari-Chiebao et al. 2018). This decision is mostly based

392

on the ease of implementing spreadsheets, linear models, moving averages, or spline models. In this

393

section we instead call for approaches that describe the full distribution of flight heights in the

394

aerosphere, not only the mean flight height. To justify this call, we again focus on collision risk

395

estimation. Indeed, if the variance in flight height is large enough, a proportion of time may be spent

396

in the collision zone even if the mean flight height is outside the collision zone. In simulations, the

397

proportion of time spent in the collision zone indeed depended on both the mean and the variance in

398

flight height (Fig. 4a-b). In the raptor datasets, the estimated probability of flying in the collision zone

399

did not decrease much for the individuals whose mean flight height was estimated above the

400

collision zone (Fig. 4c). Similarly, the individuals that had an estimated mean flight height well below

401

the collision zone were predicted to spend about 20% of their time in the collision zone (Fig. 4c). We

402

strongly recommend that collision risk forecasts should not be based on the fixed effects of linear

403

models, but instead on the full distribution of flight heights – a recommendation that will likely hold

404

for all studies into vertical airspace use.

405

Part 3: Statistical solutions

406

The state-space model framework (de Valpine & Hastings, 2002; Fig. 5) has a structure that is

407

naturally aligned with the challenges of sampling errors in vertical space-use data. A state-space

408

model is a stochastic model describing the changes over time in a state variable (here, the true flight

409

height), when that variable is imperfectly observed (here, the recorded flight height). There is a

410

“state process”, separated from an “observation process” (Fig. 5). State-space models are routinely

411

used to correct for positioning errors in satellite-tracking data (chap. 6 in Sanz Subirana et al., 2013),

412

including in wildlife studies (Patterson et al. 2008, Johnson et al. 2008, Albertsen et al. 2015, Brost et

413

al. 2015, Buderman et al. 2015, Fleming et al. 2017). Importantly, these applications are not to be

414

confused with another application of state-space models to movement data, when the focal state

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/751271; this version posted September 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

415

variable is a “behavioural state” whose Markovian transitions drive changes in movement rates

416

(Gurarie et al. 2016, Pirotta et al. 2018, Murgatroyd et al. 2018). Instead, when the objective is to

417

correct for positioning errors, the state variable is the position itself.

418

In studies of flight height, the movement model can be set up such that the state variable always

419

stays above zero. Then, if the recorded flight height is -7m, the model “knows” that the error was at

420

least 7m (Ross-Smith et al., 2016; cf. Part 2.4). Actually, the presence of unambiguously erroneous

421

records makes flight height studies better-suited to apply state-space models than many studies into

422

horizontal space use by animals. Indeed, even when in theory the model is estimable, sometimes

423

only a subset of the parameters of a state-space model are separately estimable, a phenomenon

424

called “weak identifiability” that occurs when the sampling variance largely exceeds the process

425

variance. An example of weak identifiability is when the difference between two classes of

426

individuals are larger than the differences within the classes (Garrett and Zeger 2000). In addition,

427

there are large statistical correlations between variance parameters in a movement model (Fleming

428

et al. 2017), making it extra difficult to accurately separate movements and errors in sparse datasets.

429

In that context, unambiguously erroneous records, such as negative flight heights, represent an

430

additional source of information (Brost et al. 2015). They can help separate the process and sampling

431

variances (Péron et al. 2017) and solve issues of weak identifiability.

432

As a perspective, we stress that there are also ways to obtain unambiguously correct records. These

433

records could in theory perform a role similar to that of unambiguously erroneous records. For

434

example, sometimes the position of the animals can be confirmed, e.g., at a documented feeding

435

site, a nest, or by an incidental ground-based sighting. Those records can then be matched to the

436

GPS track, yielding an exact measure of the local error. Animal-borne devices may also include a

437

transponder designed to signal passage near strategically-placed emitters (e.g., Rebke, Coulson,

438

Becker, & Vaupel, 2010). This type of validation data is routinely used in other applications of the GPS

439

technology (Sanz Subirana et al. 2013). Lastly, the state-space framework is naturally conducive to

440

the joint analysis of multiple sources of error-prone data (e.g., Péron, Nicolai, & Koons, 2012). In

441

flight height studies, it is therefore possible to jointly analyse GPS and altimeter data, or multiple GPS

442

streams coming from the same animal. This double-data approach is expected to help with statistical

443

covariance issues, but cannot be expected to fully resolve all identifiability issues (Besbeas & Morgan,

444

2017), which only error-free validation data can do.

445

We should eventually stress that several wildlife GPS manufacturers already use a state-space model

446

as part of the onboard data pre-processing algorithm, i.e., the released data have already been

447

corrected by a proprietary state-space algorithm which may furthermore rely on proprietary

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/751271; this version posted September 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

448

validation data (Ornitela staff, pers. comm.). From our experience, in wildlife applications, these pre-

449

processing algorithms are only applied during “bursts” of high-frequency data acquisition, not when

450

the users request a more traditional low-frequency data acquisition schedule. Importantly, the data

451

may not be pre-processed across bursts. The error from the first location of a burst is then carried

452

over the entire burst sequence. Flight height tracks affected by this issue would exhibit a staircase-

453

shaped profile. Overall, this type of data pre-processing trades a lower error variance against a larger

454

error autocorrelation. Additional state-space modelling of the released pre-processed data can deal

455

with this type of error autocorrelation, but the models need to be custom-made, i.e., are not

456

routinely implemented in software. Perhaps more worryingly, some commercially-available GPS units

457

apparently simply truncate the recorded height at zero above sea level (pers. obs.). We call for a

458

more open approach to these data manipulations, including making the raw, unprocessed GPS

459

records available, in addition to any pre-processed data, and with a formal description of the pre-

460

processing algorithm.

461

We also acknowledge that the fitting of state-space models to vertical space use data still requires

462

relatively rare statistical skills. Nevertheless, there are already several free, open-source computing

463

environments to fit state-space models to vertical (and horizontal) movement data, and thereby

464

estimate the most likely movement track as a by-product of the estimated parameters, similarly to

465

how the individual values would be computed in a generalized mixed model with individual random

466

effects:

467

- The crawl (Johnson et al. 2008) and ctmm (Calabrese et al. 2016) packages for R. These compute

468

the likelihood of the state-space model using a Kalman filter. This algorithm is fast but requires all the

469

model processes to be Gaussian or approximately Gaussian (no truncation or constraint, no excess

470

extreme values, no excess kurtosis or skew).

471

- The TMB package for R (Kristensen et al. 2014) approximates the likelihood of the state-space

472

model using the automatic differentiation algorithm with Laplace approximation. That approach

473

makes computing times shorter than the next option, while still allowing for flexible modelling such

474

as non-Gaussian errors (Albertsen et al. 2015), custom link functions (Péron et al. 2017), or multiple

475

data streams.

476

- The Monte Carlo Markov Chain Bayesian framework (Plummer 2003, Spiegelhalter et al. 2003,

477

Csilléry et al. 2010) generates parameter distributions that iteratively converge towards the solution.

478

This option is the most flexible in terms of nonlinearities and non-Gaussian features, such as

479

truncated distributions (Brost et al. 2015), but the computing time can be prohibitive large for

480

datasets.

482

Conclusion

483

Improper error-handling methodologies yield a flawed picture of aerial niches. For example,

484

discarding negative flight height records artificially truncates the observed distribution of flight

485

heights (Fig. 3), and focusing on the mean flight height alone (for example when using linear models)

486

does not fully describe the aerial niche (Fig. 4). While these observations are quite intuitive, bad

487

practices remain common enough that it was important to stress these issues and illustrate them

488

thoroughly. On the other hand, not addressing the occurrence of errors at all would artificially

489

spread-out the observed distribution of flight heights (Fig. 2), leading for example to increased

490

observed vertical overlap between species and individuals, which can modify the inference about

491

community processes. Improper error handling procedures would also tamper with the

492

quantification of behaviour and flight strategies, by increasing or decreasing the observed vertical

493

velocity, and interfere with behavioural state assignments. Lastly, errors may covary with

494

environmental covariates such as terrain roughness and wind speed, e.g., GPS positioning precision

495

decreases with terrain roughness (D’Eon et al. 2002) and wind speed decreases near the ground

496

(Sachs 2005). Thereby, selectively discarding records based on the number of available satellites or

497

the dilution of precision would lead to imbalanced sampling of terrain roughness, and discarding

498

negative flight height records (that predominantly occur near the ground) would lead to

499

misrepresent the relationship to wind speed.

500

Regarding applied consequences, we focused on demonstrating how improper methods would

501

imperfectly quantify the time spent by GPS-tracked raptors in the rotor-swept zone of wind turbines

502

(Fig. 3b). There are many other human-wildlife conflicts for the use of the aerosphere, for example

503

bird strikes near airports and disturbance of wildlife by drones and other recreational aircraft.

504

Regarding bird strikes, GPS-based predictive models of bird flight height (e.g., Péron et al. 2017)

505

might help plan ahead the operation of airports. The state-space class of model that we advocate is

506

actually already used, in real time, to exploit bird activity data from radar monitors and generate a

507

warning system for airport managers (Bruder 1997). Regarding recreational aircraft and drones,

508

analysing bird-borne GPS tracks may help reveal the effect of the disturbance, which is expected to

509

increase in frequency as drones in particular become more popular (Rebolo-Ifrán et al. 2019). The

510

recommendations we made about the effect of errors on the estimation of aerial niche overlaps and

511

the quantification of behaviours seem particularly relevant in this context.

512

In conclusion, the issue of properly handling errors in flight height data is key to any aeroecology

513

study. We strongly advise against ad-hoc “data quality” filters, and against statistical tools that only

document variation in the mean flight height instead of the full distribution of flight height. Our

proposed statistical framework based on state-space models and the analysis of the full distribution

of flight heights requires interdisciplinary work between experts in flight behaviour and experts in

data analysis, and the emergence of interface specialists, but the insights and the applied decisions

based on those insights are expected to be more reliable.

Fig. 1: Illustration of the difference between true and recorded flight height. A: True flight height

724

above ground (htrue), and true elevation above ellipsoid (ztrue). B: Adding the five sources of error, with

725

circled numbers referring to headings in Part 1. DEM stands for Digital Elevation Model. C: Two tracks

726

with the same amount of error. The bird of track 1 is flying high so all the recorded flight height data

727

remain positive despite the errors. The bird of track 2 is flying low, so some of the recorded data fall

728

below the digital elevation model.

729
730

Fig. 2: Comparison between the standard deviation of the recorded flight height (y-axis) and of the

731

corrected flight height (x-axis), assumed to represent the true flight height, in three species of large

732

soaring raptors. Each point stands for one bird over its entire monitoring period. The state-space

733

model that we used to correct the flight heights, and in particular its robustness to variation in

734

sampling resolution across populations, is explained in Péron et al. (2017). The diagonal line shows

735

where the points should be if the recorded flight heights were error-free.

736
737

Fig. 3: Removing the negative recorded flight heights introduces biases in the distribution of the

738

remaining flight heights. Left group of panels: in simulations, where the true flight height is known.

739

Right group of panels: in the raptor case studies, where the corrected flight height is assumed to

740

represent the true flight height. In all panels, the x-axis features the variance in the true (or

741

corrected) flight height. The y-axis features the percentage bias in (a) mean flight height; (b) collision

742

risk (proportion of time spent between 60 and 180m above ground); (c) variance in flight height; and

743

(d) skewness of the distribution of flight height. A percentage bias of +10% means that the focal

744

quantity is 10% larger after we remove the negative records.

745
746

Fig. 4. The variance in flight height influences the percentage of time spent in the collision zone of a

747

wind farm (grey area, between 60 and 180 m). (a) Four simulated tracks (where the true flight height

748

is known) with the same mean flight height (200m) but different variances (10, 50, 100, and 250m²).

749

(b) More extensive simulations. Each point corresponds to one simulated track with a different mean

750

flight height. (c) Same as (b) but using real datasets collected from three raptor species, where the

751

corrected flight height is assumed to represent the true flight height. Each symbol stands for an

752

individual over its entire monitoring period.

Fig. 5: Schematic overview of the principles of a state-space model as applied to the correction of

755

sampling errors in flight height data. The movement (or state) process accounts for the distribution

756

of true flight heights. The observation process introduces sampling errors of various origins (Part 1)

757

and yields the recorded flight heights. It also accounts for the sampling schedule. By fitting this model

758

to recorded flight height time series, we can retrospectively compute the corrected flight height, an

759

estimate of the true flight height.
