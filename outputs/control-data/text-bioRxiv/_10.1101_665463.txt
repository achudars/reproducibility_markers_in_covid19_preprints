Abstract
In oval shaped Streptococcus pneumoniae, septal and longitudinal peptidoglycan synthesis is
performed by independent functional complexes; the divisome and the elongasome. Penicillin
binding proteins (PBPs) were long considered as the key peptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes in
these complexes. Among these were the bifunctional class A PBPs, which are both
glycosyltransferases and transpeptidases, and monofunctional class B PBPs with only
transpeptidase activity. Recently, however, it was established that the monofunctional class B
PBPs work together with non-PBP glycosyltransferases (FtsW and RodA) to make up the core
peptidoglycan synthesizing machineries within the pneumococcal divisome (FtsW/PBP2x) and
elongasome (RodA/PBP2b). The function of class A PBPs is therefore now an open question.
Here we utilize the peptidoglycan hydrolase CbpD to show that class A PBPs have an
autonomous role during cell wall synthesis in S. pneumoniae. Purified CbpD was shown to target
the septum of S. pneumoniae cells. Using assays to specifically inhibit PBP2x, we demonstrate
that CbpD specifically target nascent peptidoglycan synthesized by the divisome. Notably, class
A PBPs could process this nascent peptidoglycan from a CbpD-sensitive to a CbpD-resistant
form. The class A PBP mediated processing was independent of divisome and elongasome
activities. Class A PBPs thus constitute an autonomous functional entity which processes or
repairs nascent peptidoglycan synthesized by FtsW/PBP2x. Our results support a model in which
pneumococcal peptidoglycan is made by three functional entities, the divisome, the elongasome
and a peptidoglycan-repairing or -remodelling complex consisting of bifunctional PBPs. To our
knowledge this is the first time a specific function has been identified for class A PBPs in
bacterial cell wall synthesis.

Introduction
The peptidoglycan layer covering the pneumococcal cell provides shape and rigidity, and is
essential for growth and survival. It consists of linear chains of two alternating amino sugars, Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), interlinked by peptide
bridges between MurNAcs on adjacent strands1,2. Peptidoglycan is synthesized from lipid II
precursors at the outside the cytoplasmic membrane by glycosyltransferases that polymerize the
glycan chains and transpeptidases that interconnect the chains through peptide cross-links. S.
pneumoniae produce five different penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) with transpeptidase
activity, namely PBP1a, PBP1b, PBP2a, PBP2b and PBP2x3. The first three of these, designated
class A PBPs, are bifunctional enzymes that catalyse transglycosylation as well as
transpeptidation, while PBP2x and PBP2b are monofunctional transpeptidases (class B PBPs)4.
Monofunctional glycosyltransferases that have homology to the glycosyltransferase domains of
class A PBPs are present in some bacterial species, but are absent from S. pneumoniae. PBP2x is
an essential constituent of the divisome, a multiprotein division machine that synthesizes the
septal cross-wall3,5,6,7. The other monofunctional transpeptidase, PBP2b, is a key component of
another multiprotein complex, the elongasome, which is responsible for longitudinal
peptidoglycan synthesis3,5,6,7,8. Until recently, it was believed that only class A PBPs were able to
polymerize glycan chains in S. pneumoniae. Consequently, the divisome as well as the
elongasome would have to include at least one class A PBP in order to be functional. Recently,
however, it was discovered that FtsW and RodA, two proteins belonging to the SEDS (shape,
elongation, division, and sporulation) family, function as peptidoglycan polymerases that
synthesize glycan strands from lipid II9,10,11. FtsW and RodA were originally reported to be lipid
II flippases, a function now assigned to MurJ12. However, it is still not entirely clear whether
these polytopic membrane proteins are monofunctional glycan polymerases or bifunctional
flippases and polymerases13,14. Previous research has shown that FtsW and RodA are essential,
and work in conjunction with PBP2x and PBP2b, respectively9,11.
Peptidoglycan synthesis requires the concerted action of enzymes that carry out
transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions. Thus, in principle, peptidoglycan synthesis
might be performed by monofunctional transglycosylase working together with monofunctional
transpeptidase, by single bifunctional enzymes such as the class A PBPs, or by a combination of

monofunctional and bifunctional enzymes. As mentioned above, class A PBPs have traditionally
been considered to be essential components of bacterial divisomes and elongasomes. However, it
has been known for a long time that Bacillus subtilis is viable without class A PBPs15. Thus,
considering the recent discovery of the SEDS partners of PBP2x and PBP2b, it is conceivable
that the pneumococcal divisome and elongasome perform the primary synthesis of septal and
peripheral peptidoglycan without the involvement of class A PBPs. If so, the function of class A
PBPs is an open question, and their role in peptidoglycan synthesis must be re-examined. Here,
we have addressed this question by exploiting the unique properties of the peptidoglycan
hydrolase CbpD (choline-binding protein D).
When developing competence for natural transformation, streptococci belonging to the
mitis phylogenetic group express a set of core competence genes controlled by the competence
stimulating peptide (CSP)16 and the competence-specific two-component regulatory system
ComDE17. Most proteins whose expression are controlled by this quorum-sensing-like system
are involved in DNA-binding, DNA-uptake, DNA-processing or genomic integration of
internalized DNA18,19. However, among the CSP/ComDE-regulated genes is a peptidoglycandegrading enzyme, CbpD, which does not seem to have a role in any of the transformation steps
mentioned above19,20. Instead, evidence strongly suggests that CbpD, which is encoded by a late
competence gene, is part of a DNA-acquisition mechanism consisting of CbpD and the cognate
immunity protein ComM21,22,23. Previous research has shown that ComM, a polytopic membrane
protein encoded by an early competence gene, protects competent pneumococci from being lysed
by their own CbpD. The mechanism behind this protection is not understood24,25.
CbpD is composed of three different domain types: an N-terminal cysteine, histidinedependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP) domain, one or two Src homology 3b (SH3b)
domains, and a C-terminal choline-binding domain (Cbd) consisting of four choline-binding
repeats. CHAP domains are present in many peptidoglycan hydrolases, and function as either Nacetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases or endopeptidases19,26. Hence, the CHAP domain of CbpD
must cleave somewhere within the peptide bridges of streptococcal peptidoglycan. However, so
far the exact bond cleaved has not been identified. The SH3b domain is essential for the function
of CbpD, and experimental evidence indicates that it binds to the peptidoglycan portion of the
cell wall27. CbpDs from Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis contain only one SH3b

domain, sandwiched between the CHAP and the Cbd domain, while many (but not all) strains of
S. pneumoniae contain two successive SH3b domains. The choline-binding repeats of the Cbd
domain anchor CbpD to cell wall teichoic acid, and possibly also lipoteichoic acid, through noncovalent interactions with the choline residues decorating these polymers28. Mitis group
streptococci such as S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. mitis, S. oralis and S. infantis
produce choline-decorated teichoic acids, while this type of teichoic acid is not present in mitis
group streptococci that are more distantly related to S. pneumoniae29. Similar to the CHAP and
SH3b domains, the Cbd domain is essential for the biological function of CbpD27.
Even though CbpD appears to be a key component of the pneumococcal gene transfer
machinery it is still poorly characterized. It has proved very difficult to express pneumococcal
CbpD in a soluble and active form in Escherichia coli and other hosts, and we therefore
investigated whether homologs of pneumococcal CbpD from various mitis group streptococci
might be more amenable to heterologous expression. This strategy turned out to be successful, as
we were able to purify milligram amounts of the CbpD protein produced by S. mitis B6 (CbpDB6) in soluble form. In the present study, we show that CbpD-B6 is active against S.
pneumoniae, and that its properties appear to be very similar to pneumococcal CbpD.
Interestingly, we found that CbpD-B6 cleaves only a distinct subset of the peptide bridges that
cross-link the carbohydrate chains in pneumococcal peptidoglycan. It is highly specific for
nascent peptidoglycan formed by PBP2x and FtsW. We realized that this property can be
exploited as a research tool. Hence, we have used the unique specificity of CbpD to study the
functional relationships between different peptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes in S.
pneumoniae. Our results strongly indicate that class A PBPs are not part of the core machinery of
the divisome and elongasome, but have an important autonomous role in construction of the fully
matured peptidoglycan layer.

Results
Purification and properties of CbpD-B6
The gene encoding cbpD from S. mitis B6 was amplified by PCR, ligated into the

proteins bind to the diethylaminoethanol groups of DEAE-cellulose via their choline-binding
repeats, the soluble protein fraction was subjected to DEAE-cellulose affinity chromatography as
previously described30. The recombinant CbpD-B6 protein was further purified by size-exclusion
chromatography (SEC) on a SuperdexTM 75 10/300 GL column (see Methods section for details).
After SEC some CbpD-B6 fractions were essentially pure as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig.
S1). These fractions were collected and used for further studies.
CbpD-B6 and CbpD from S. pneumoniae strain R6 (CbpD-R6) are highly homologous
except for the extra SH3b domain present in CbpD-R6 (Fig. S2). We therefore assumed that the
two enzymes have more or less the same properties, and that CbpD-B6 can be used as a proxy
for CbpD-R6. To test this assumption, we first investigated whether CbpD-B6 is active against
non-competent S. pneumoniae R6 cells. The results presented in Fig. 1A show that the R6 strain
is highly sensitive to CbpD-B6, and that a concentration of about 0.3 µg ml-1 lyses 50% of the
cells in a R6 culture at OD550 = 0.2. To compare the properties of the CbpD-R6 and CbpD-B6
enzymes under in vivo conditions, we replaced the native cbpD gene with cbpD-B6 in strain R6.
This was done in a wild-type strain (A) as well as a

ΔcomM

genetic background (strain B),

resulting in strains C (strain A, cbpD-B6) and D (strain B, cbpD-B6). Induction of competence in
cultures of these strains by addition of CSP at OD550 = 0.2 resulted in almost identical growth
and lysis patterns (Fig. 1B and C). The growth of the A and C strains were virtually unaffected
by competence induced CbpD secretion, as they express the immunity protein ComM. However,
significant and similar lysis were observed when strains B and D were induced to competence
(Fig. 1C). These results show that CbpD-R6 and CbpD-B6 have very similar properties.

CbpD-B6 attacks the septal area of the pneumococcal cell wall
In an attempt to identify the specific bond cleaved by CbpD, purified peptidoglycan from S.
pneumoniae R6 was digested with CbpD-B6 and mutanolysin followed by HPLC analysis of the
resulting digest31. We were not able to detect any significant difference in muropeptide
composition between mutanolysin digested samples and CbpD-B6/mutanolysin double-digested
samples. This indicated that the enzyme is not active against purified peptidoglycan, or that it
only cleaves a small subset of the peptide bonds present in pneumococcal peptidoglycan. To
investigate the latter possibility, pneumococci exposed to purified recombinant CbpD-B6 were

examined by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for visualization of
changes in their ultrastructure. Pneumococcal cultures were treated for 60 seconds with 0.5 µg
ml-1 of enzyme, after which the bacteria were fixed and the reaction stopped by the addition of
2% formaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (v v-1). The SEM microscopy analysis clearly
showed that CbpD-B6 attacks only the septal region of the peptidoglycan sacculus, resulting in
cells that are split in half along their equators (Fig. 2A and B). Interestingly, the rims of both
hemispheres in the split cells are thicker than the rest of the peptidoglycan layer. This suggests
that CbpD-B6 cleaves the cells along the middle of the equatorial ring, also called the piecrust.
Alternatively, the peptidoglycan layer has rolled back on itself to become double at the rims. In
accordance with the SEM data, the TEM micrographs of CbpD-B6 treated cells showed damage
to the peptidoglycan layer only in the septal region. In some cells that were about to rupture,
“footprints” of the enzyme’s activity could be seen. Judging from these footprints, CbpD-B6
cleaves peptide bridges located within and/or close to the base of the septal cross-wall (Fig. 2C
and D).

CbpD-B6 specifically cleaves nascent peptidoglycan formed by PBP2x and FtsW
Since CbpD-B6 attacks the septal region of the cell, we speculated that the enzyme targets the
peptidoglycan formed by PBP2x and FtsW. If so, specific inhibition of the divisome activity
might render pneumococci less sensitive or insensitive to CbpD-B6. In a recent profiling of the

β-lactam

selectivity of pneumococcal PBPs, Kocaoglu et al.32 showed that PBP2x is more

sensitive than PBP1a, PBP1b, PBP2a and PBP2b to several different β-lactams. Hence, by using
the appropriate

β-lactam

at the right concentration it should be possible to inhibit the

transpeptidase activity of PBP2x without significantly affecting the function of the other PBPs.
To test this hypothesis, we grew pneumococcal cultures in 96 well plates in a microplate reader
at 37 ⁰C. When reaching OD550 ~ 0.2, each culture was treated with a different concentration of
oxacillin. The oxacillin concentrations used ranged from 0-100 µg ml-1, i.e. from sub- to supraMIC concentrations. Ten minutes after being exposed to oxacillin, each culture received 5 µg ml1

of purified CbpD-B6. Comparison of the lytic responses of the cultures showed that the extent

of lysis gradually decreased with increasing oxacillin concentrations until the cells became
resistant to CbpD-B6 at concentrations between 0.19 – 6.1 µg ml-1 (Fig. 3A). The lowest

concentration that gave full protection (0.19 µg ml-1), corresponds roughly to the MIC value of
oxacillin against the R6 strain (Fig. S3). However, to our great surprise, the pneumococci started
to lyse again when the concentration of oxacillin was increased further, i.e. above 6.1 µg ml-1. At
the highest oxacillin concentrations used (50 and 100 µg ml-1), the pneumococci became as
sensitive as untreated control cells (Fig. 3A). In sum, the results show that as the oxacillin
concentration is gradually increased the lytic response to CbpD-B6 shifts from decreasing
sensitivity (S1-phase) to resistance (R-phase) and then back to increasing sensitivity (S2-phase).
In line with the observations above, GFP-CbpD has previously been shown to mainly
bind the septal region of pneumococcal cells, and the binding specificity is determined by the Cterminal choline-binding domain27. To test whether CbpD-resistance during the R-phase could be
explained by altered binding of CbpD after exposure to oxacillin, we analyzed the binding
patterns of sfGFP-CbpD-B6 as previously described27. The fusion protein was expressed and
purified essentially as CbpD-B6, and exposed to RH425 control cells as well as RH425 cells
treated with 0.8 µg/ml oxacillin for 10 minutes (resulting in R-phase cells, Fig. 3A). sfGFPCbpD-B6 retained the localization to the septal region after oxacillin-treatment for cells in all
division stages (Fig. S4A), although the fraction of cells without septal sfGFP-CbpD-B6 was
slightly higher than in the control cells (6.7 % in control cells and 11.8 % after oxacillin
treatment, Fig. S4B). This show that the R-phase cannot be explained by alterations in the
binding pattern of sfGFP-CbpD-B6.

PBPs

Βeta-lactam-resistant pneumococci have acquired so-called low-affinity PBPs, modified
that have much lower affinity for β-lactams than the corresponding PBPs of sensitive

strains. To verify that the R-phase is due to inhibition of PBP2x by oxacillin, the experiment
described above was repeated with an R6 mutant strain (KHB321) expressing a low-affinity
version of PBP2x. The KHB321 mutant was constructed by replacing the extracytoplasmic part
of R6-pbp2x with the corresponding part of the low-affinity pbp2x gene from S. mitis strain B6.
The B6 strain is a highly penicillin-resistant clinical isolate that produces low-affinity versions of
PBP2x, PBP2b and PBP1a33. When the oxacillin titration experiment was carried out with the
KHB321 strain, no R-phase was obtained within the concentration range used (0-100 µg ml-1
oxacillin) (Fig. 3B). This result clearly shows that inhibition of the transpeptidase activity of

PBP2x by oxacillin causes the R-phase. Moreover, it shows that CbpD-B6 specifically attacks
the peptidoglycan formed by PBP2x/FtsW in the divisome.

The S2 phase
During the S1-phases the oxacillin concentration increases gradually resulting in
progressively stronger inhibition of PBP2x. This causes a gradual reduction in the number of
nascent peptide bridges formed by PBP2x, and eventually complete inhibition of its
transpeptidase activity in the R-phase. While this line of reasoning provides an explanation for
the S1- and R-phases, it does not explain the S2-phase. How can a further increase in oxacillin
concentration lead to increased cell lysis when PBP2x is completely inhibited? We observed that
the R-phase disappears if oxacillin (0.8 µg ml-1) and CbpD-B6 are added simultaneously to
pneumococcal cultures. After being exposed to oxacillin it takes 3-4 minutes before the cells
develop full immunity against CbpD-B6 (Fig. 3C). This shows that the peptidoglycan initially
formed by the PBP2x/FtsW machinery must undergo remodelling before it becomes resistant to
CbpD-B6, a process that takes several minutes. This finding suggested a plausible explanation
for the S2-phase. Although PBP2x is more sensitive than the other pneumococcal PBPs to
oxacillin, a further increase in oxacillin concentration will eventually affect the transpeptidase
activity of the less sensitive PBPs. Presumably, the activity of one or more of these PBPs is
required to remodel PBP2x/FtsW-synthesized peptidoglycan into a CbpD-B6-resistant form.
Consequently, the cells will not become resistant if their activity is blocked. The reason for this
is that newly synthesized CbpD-B6-sensitive peptidoglycan will still be present if the activities
of PBP2x and the PBP(s) required for processing this peptidoglycan are blocked simultaneously.
In sum, our results indicate that the S2-phase results from inhibition of the PBP(s) required for
processing PBP2x/FtsW-synthesized peptidoglycan into a CbpD-B6-resistant form.

Peptidoglycan synthesized by the FtsW/PBP2x machinery is further processed by class A PBPs

To determine whether class A PBPs are required to produce mature CbpD-B6-resitant
peptidoglycan, the oxacillin titration experiment described above was performed in the presence
of 10 µg ml-1 of the antibiotic moenomycin. Moenomycin inhibits bacterial growth by blocking
the transglycosylase activity of class A PBPs, but does not affect FtsW and RodA9. Our results
showed that in the presence of moenomycin the S1-R-S2 pattern disappeared, and the
pneumococci were sensitive to CbpD-B6 at all oxacillin concentrations used (0-100 µg ml-1
oxacillin) (Fig. 4 and supplementary Fig. S5A). This demonstrates that without functional class
A PBPs, nascent peptidoglycan is not converted to the CbpD-B6-resistant form.
As three different class A PBPs are produced by S. pneumoniae (PBP1a, Pbp1b and
PBP2a) we wondered whether or not the concerted action of all three is needed for the
maturation process. To answer this question the oxacillin titration experiment was performed
with a mutant strain expressing a low-affinity PBP1a protein from S. mitis B6. Using the same
concentration range as before (0-100 µg ml-1 oxacillin), we only observed the S1- and R-phases
in this experiment. The S2-phase had disappeared and was replaced with an extended R-phase
(Fig 4 and Fig. S5B). This result shows that the activity of PBP1a alone is sufficient to transform
PBP2x/FtsW-synthesized peptidoglycan into the CbpD-B6-resistant form.
The class A PBPs of S. pneumoniae strain R6 can be deleted one by one, and are
therefore individually non-essential. PBP1a/PBP1b and PBP2a/PBP1b double mutants can also
be constructed, whereas PBP1a/PBP2a double mutants are non-viable6,7. The fact that
pneumococcal cells need either PBP1a or PBP2a to survive, indicates that these PBPs can, at
least to a certain extent, substitute for each other. If the observed conversion of PBP2x/FtsWsynthesized peptidoglycan into a CbpD-B6-resistant form represents an important element in the
construction of a mature pneumococcal cell wall, it would be expected that this remodelling step
can be carried out also by PBP2a. To address this question, we performed the oxacillin titration
experiment with a Δpbp2a/Δpbp1b and a Δpbp1a/Δpbp1b strain. In both cases we observed the
usual S1, R and S2 phases (Fig. 4 and Fig. S5C and D), demonstrating that PBP2a can substitute
for PBP1a in the process that transforms CbpD-B6-sensitive peptidoglycan into a resistant
structure.

PBP2b and the elongasome

Having established that class A PBPs are essential for the maturation of FtsW/PBP2xsynthesized peptidoglycan, we wanted to determine whether the maturation process also requires
an active elongasome. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any β-lactam or other drug to which
PBP2b is more sensitive than the other pneumococcal PBPs. Consequently, we were not able to
specifically inhibit the transpeptidase activity of PBP2b without running the risk of inhibiting the
activity of the other PBPs as well. Instead, we carried out the oxacillin titration experiment with
a

Δpbp2b, ΔlytA,

MreCΔaa182-272 mutant strain (strain ds789), which lacks a functional

elongasome. PBP2b is essential in a wild-type background, but can be deleted in a strain
expressing a truncated version of the elongasome protein MreC34. Moreover, since pneumococci
depleted in PBP2b becomes hypersensitive to LytA8, we deleted the lytA gene to avoid extensive
autolysis. Deletion of lytA does not affect the S1-R-S2 pattern observed when wild-type
pneumococci are subjected to increasing concentrations of oxacillin (Fig. S5E). When
performing this experiment, we observed the usual S1-R-S2 pattern (Fig. 4 and Fig. S5F), but
complete resistance was not reached when CbpD-B6 was added 10 minutes subsequent to
oxacillin. However, after 15 minutes close to full resistance was obtained in cultures treated with
0.19-0.75 µg ml-1. This experiment shows that Class A PBPs are not dependent on a functional
elongasome to convert nascent PBP2x/FtsW-synthesized peptidoglycan into a CbpD resistant
form.

Discussion
Recently it has become clear that FtsW/PBP2x and RodA/PBP2b constitute cognate pairs of
interacting proteins that make up the core peptidoglycan synthesizing machineries within the
pneumococcal divisome and elongasome, respectively9,10,11. Both couples consist of a
monofunctional transglycosylase working together with a monofunctional transpeptidase. This
discovery has important implications for our understanding of pneumococcal cell wall synthesis,
and the role played by class A PBPs in this process. Before it was discovered that the SEDS
proteins FtsW and RodA have glucosyltransferase activity, class A PBPs were considered to be
the only peptidoglycan polymerases present in pneumococci. Hence, they were regarded as key
components of the divisome and elongasome, and indispensable for septal as well as peripheral

peptidoglycan synthesis. This way of thinking is no longer valid, and the function of class A
PBPs has therefore become an open question.
Our results show that class A PBPs act downstream of the FtsW/PBP2x machinery to
produce alterations in the cell wall. Class A PBPs are able to function, i.e. to convert
FtsW/PBP2x-synthesized peptidoglycan into a CbpD-B6-resistant form, even when PBP2x is
completely inhibited by oxacillin. Similarly, we show that class A PBPs are able to operate
independently of PBP2b and the elongasome in a

Δpbp2b

mutant. Furthermore, since the

conversion process takes several minutes, the activity of class A PBPs occur subsequent to and
separate in time from FtsW/PBP2x-mediated peptidoglycan synthesis. Together these findings
provide three novel and important insights: i) class A PBPs have a distinct and unique role in the
construction of the pneumococcal cell wall, ii) there exists a class A-mediated mechanism that
remodels nascent FtsW/PBP2x-synthesized peptidoglycan into a mature CbpD-B6-resistant
form, and iii) this maturation mechanism is essential.
It is well established that the divisome and elongasome constitute two separate
peptidoglycan synthesizing machineries5. Their activities are precisely coordinated during the
cell cycle, but experiments have shown that the divisome is able to operate in the absence of the
elongasome and vice versa. Pneumococcal cultures treated with oxacillin (0.1 µg ml-1), at a
concentration that inhibits PBP2x but not class A PBPs and PBP2b, give rise to highly elongated
cells with no septal cross-walls (Fig. S6A and B). This demonstrates that the elongasome is
active even in the absence of a functional divisome. Similar findings have been reported
previously by others5,35,36,37. In the opposite case, several studies have shown that pneumococci
are able to grow and form septal cross walls when PBP2b is depleted or deleted8,34,38,39.
Pneumococci that are strongly depleted in PBP2b form long chains of round cells that are
compressed in the direction of the long axis (Fig. S6 C and D). In the present study, we have
obtained evidence that class A PBPs operate independently of the divisome and elongasome and
hence function autonomously. An important question is therefore whether PBP1a, PBP2a and
PBP1b operate alone or in multiprotein complexes similar to the divisome and elongasome. It
has been reported that PBP1a forms a complex with CozE, MreC and MreD40, and that it coimmunoprecipitates with the cell cycle protein GpsB41. Furthermore, it has been shown that
PBP2a is regulated by MacP, a substrate of the global cell cycle regulator StkP42. The interplay

between the two PBPs and their respective partners appears to be specific, as interactions
between CozE/PBP2a and MacP/PBP1a have not been detected40,42. Presumably, the specific
partners of PBP1a and PBP2a are important for the precise spatiotemporal regulation of their
activity. Together the data support a model in which PBP1a, PBP2a and PBP1b are the key
players in three separate and autonomous peptidoglycan synthesizing machineries with partially
overlapping functions.
The fact that class A PBP-mediated remodelling of nascent peptidoglycan is inhibited by
oxacillin as well as moenomycin strongly indicates that both catalytic domains of these proteins
are actively involved in the remodelling process. Hence, the remodelling mechanism most likely
involves the synthesis of new glycan strands, and the incorporation of these strands into existing
peptidoglycan. How could peptidoglycan synthesis by class A PBPs make the cell wall resistant
to CbpD-B6? The muralytic enzyme consists of three different domains, a catalytic CHAP
domain, an SH3b domain and a choline-binding domain that anchors CbpD-B6 to teichoic acid.
The SH3b domain probably acts as an auxiliary module that binds peptidoglycan and facilitates
the function of the catalytic CHAP domain27. Previous research has shown that all three domains
are required for the enzyme to be active27. Hence, it would be sufficient to block the function of
one of these domains to convert the cell wall into a CbpD-B6-resistant form. To inhibit the
activity of the CHAP domain would require that the nascent peptide bridge cross-linked by
PBP2x is altered to become resistant to the enzyme. A structural change in this peptide bridge
might also block the binding of the SH3b domain, as the SH3b domain of lysostaphin has been
reported to bind to the peptide part of the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus43. The peptide
bridges in pneumococcal peptidoglycan consists of a mixture of branched and unbranched crosslinks. The branches are introduced by the aminoacyl ligases MurM and MurN. MurM catalyzes
the addition of L-Ala or L-Ser, whereas the addition of the second L-Ala is catalyzed by MurN44.
We hypothesized that if class A PBPs synthesize peptidoglycan containing only branched
peptides, and the CHAP and/or SH3b domains only recognize unbranched peptidoglycan, the
cell wall synthesized by class A PBPs would be resistant against CbpD-B6. This hypothesis did
not receive support from the experimental data, however, as a strain lacking murMN behaved
exactly like wild-type when subjected to the oxacillin titration assay described above (Fig. S7).
Alternatively, we speculated that the SH3 domain recognizes the glycan part of the
peptidoglycan instead of the peptide part. Thus, the oxacillin titration assay was performed with

ΔpgdA

and

Δadr

mutant strains as well. The pdgA gene encodes a peptidoglycan N-

acetylglucosamine deacetylase, while the adr gene encodes a peptidoglycan O-acetyl transferase45,46.
The ΔpgdA and Δadr strains displayed approximately the same S1-R-S2 pattern as the wild type strain,
demonstrating that neither N-acetylation nor O-acetylation significantly affect the ability of CbpD-B6 to
cleave pneumococcal peptidoglycan during the S1 and S2 phases (Fig. 8A and B). Furthermore, it is
possible that class A PBP-mediated remodelling of pneumococcal peptidoglycan affects the
ability of CbpD-B6 to attach to teichoic acid via its C-terminal choline-binding domain. It has
been shown previously that CbpD-R6 binds to the septal region of the cell, and that the cholinebinding domain alone is sufficient to target the enzyme to this localization27. To determine if
resistance against CbpD during the R-phase is caused by reduced binding to the midcell region,
we examined the binding pattern of sfGFP-CbpD-B6 to oxacillin-treated (0.8 µg ml-1) R-phase
cells and untreated cells. The fraction of cells lacking a fluorescent signal in the midcell region
was slightly higher among the R-phase cells (Fig. S4A and B), but this small difference cannot
explain why R-phase cells are fully resistant against CbpD-B6. Finally, to determine whether
inactivation of the class A PBPs has any effect on pneumococcal morphology, cells were treated
with moenomycin for 2 hours before they were fixed and prepared for TEM. The amount of
moenomycin used (0.4 µg ml-1) completely inhibits peptidoglycan polymerization by class A
PBPs. The TEM micrographs revealed that moenomycin-treated cells had considerably thicker
septal cross walls than untreated cells (Fig. S9). This observation shows that something goes
wrong with the synthesis of the septal cross wall in the absence of class A PBPs. Hence, to
construct a normal mature cross wall, the primary cross wall synthesised by the PBP2x/FtsW
machinery must be further processed by class A PBPs. In the absence of class A PBPs, the
PBP2x/FtsW machinery probably does not know when to stop and just continues to synthesise
additional layers of peptidoglycan.
Considering that S. pneumoniae must express either PBP1a or PBP2a to be viable, class
A PBPs must serve an essential function. PBP1a appears to have the most prominent role among
class A PBPs, as highly β-lactam resistant pneumococci always express low-affinity versions of
PBP1a in addition to PBP2x and PBP2b. We clearly show that class A PBPs together with their
associated auxiliary proteins somehow remodels the primary peptidoglycan synthesized by the
PBP2x/FtsW machinery. As discussed above, this remodelling might involve chemical or
structural modifications of the primary peptidoglycan that inhibit the function of the CHAP,

SH3b or Cbd domain of CbpD-B6. Alternatively, class A PBPs and their helper proteins might
not synthesize peptidoglycan that is qualitatively different from the primary peptidoglycan
synthesized by PBP2x/FtsW, but rather function as a repair machinery that mend imperfections
that arise during construction and expansion of the cell wall10. It is conceivable that the
peptidoglycan layer synthesized by PBP2x/FtsW, i.e. the divisome, is not perfect. It might not be
fully homogenous but contain irregularities in the form of gaps and small holes. We speculate
that CbpD-B6 use these irregularities to penetrate into and even pass through the peptidoglycan
layer. This could explain the curious observation that CbpD-B6 can attack the cell wall from the
inside (Fig. 2 C and D). Perhaps CbpD-B6 is not able to digest “tightly woven” peptidoglycan
but depends on imperfections to get access to its substrate. We therefore propose the following
scenario to explain our observations: The divisome (PBP2x/FtsW) synthesize the primary crosswall which has structural imperfections. A few minutes later, class A PBPs and their auxiliary
proteins detect and repair these imperfections making the cell wall resistant to CbpD-B6.
However, since primary peptidoglycan synthesis performed by PBP2x/FtsW and Class Amediated repair occurs simultaneously, with the latter lagging 3-4 minutes behind, there will
always be some imperfect peptidoglycan in growing cells that can be attacked by CbpD. In the
case where PBP2x, but not class A PBPs, is inhibited by oxacillin (phase R), all gaps and
imperfections are repaired by class A PBPs before CbpD-B6 is added and the pneumococcal
cells become resistant. When higher concentrations of oxacillin are used (phase S2), PBP2x and
class A PBPs are inhibited at the same time, preventing repair of the most recently synthesized
peptidoglycan. In sum, we believe our results are best explained by a model in which the
peptidoglycan synthesizing machinery of S. pneumoniae consists of a divisome, an elongasome
and a repairosome. The reason the repairosome consists of three different machineries, PBP1a,
PBP2a and PBP1b, is probably because each have separate but overlapping functions. They
might repair different types of damages and/or operate in different parts of the cell wall. Further
confirmation or rejection of the repairosome hypothesis will be an important topic for future
studies.

All strains used in the present study are listed in Table S1. E. coli was grown in Luria Bertani
broth or on LB-agar plates at 37°C containing ampicillin (100 µg ml-1) when necessary. Liquid
cultures were grown aerobically with shaking. Chemically competent E. coli cells were
transformed by heat-shocking at 42ºC. S. pneumoniae was grown in liquid C medium47 or on
Todd-Hewitt (BD Difco®) agar plates at 37°C. When grown on TH-agar the cells were incubated
in a sealed container made anaerobically (<1% O2) by including AnaeroGen™ sachets from
Oxoid. Transformation of S. pneumoniae was done by adding CSP-1 (final concentration of 250
ng ml-1) and the transforming DNA (50-100 ng) to one ml of exponentially growing cells at
OD550 = 0.05. Following incubation at 37°C for two hours, transformants were selected by
plating 30 µl cell culture on TH-agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic; kanamycin
(400 µg ml-1), streptomycin (200 µg ml-1) or spectinomycin (200 µg ml-1).
DNA cloning
All primers used in this study are listed in Table S2. To construct pRSET-cbpD-B6, the cbpD-B6
gene from S. mitis B6 was amplified from genomic DNA using the primer pair so1/so2. The gene
was amplified without the signal sequence encoding part, starting from codon 41. The cbpD-B6
amplicon was cleaved with XbaI and HindIII and ligated into pRSET A (Invitrogen) generating
pRSET-cbpD-B6. The plasmid pRSET-sfGFP-cbpD-B6 was constructed by substituting the
CHAP encoding part (aa 41-175) of cbpD-B6 with the sf-gfp gene. The sf-gfp gene was
amplified using the kp116 and kp119 primers and SPH370 genomic DNA as template, and the
cbpD-B6-Δchap gene was amplified from SO7 genomic DNA using the primer pair
kp117/kp118. Using overlap extension PCR and the primers kp116 and kp117, sf-gfp was fused
to cbpD-B6-Δchap. The resulting sf-gfp-cbpD-B6 amplicon was cleaved with NdeI and HindIII
and ligated into pRSET A giving the pRSET-sfGFP-cbpD-B6 plasmid.
Amplicons used to transform S. pneumoniae were constructed by overlap extension PCR
as previously described by Johnsborg et al.22. We employed the Janus cassette48 to knock out
genes and to introduce recombinant DNA at desired positions in the S. pneumoniae genome.
When substituting the native pbp2x gene with a low affinity version (pbp2x-exB6), an additional
version of the native gene was ectopically expressed during transformation using the ComRSsystem as described by Berg et al.49. The spectinomycin resistant marker aad9 was employed to
knock out lytA in strain ds789.

Expression and purification of CbpD-B6
E. coli BL21 containing pRSET-cbpD-B6 was grown to OD550 = 0.4 – 0.5 at 37°C. Then
production of CbpD-B6 was induced by adding a final concentration of 0.1 mM IPTG followed
by incubation at 20°C for four hours. The cells were harvested at 5000 x g for five minutes and
resuspended in 1/100 culture volume of TBS, pH 7.4. The cells were lysed using the Fast Prep
method with

≤106

µm glass beads at 6.5 m s-1 and insoluble material were removed by

centrifugation at 20 000 x g. CbpD-B6 was purified from the soluble protein fraction by
performing DEAE cellulose chromatography as described by Sanchez-Puelles et al.30, but using
TBS (pH 7.4) instead of a phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). To remove choline from the eluted CbpDB6 protein it was dialyzed against TBS (pH 7.4) for one hour at room temperature. After
concentrating the dialyzed protein to a final volume of 500 µl using an Amicon centrifugal filter
(10 000 MW), it was further purified by gel filtration through a Superdex™ 75 10/300 GL
column (GE healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min-1 in TBS (pH 7.4).

CbpD-B6 resistance assay
Pneumococcal cells were grown in 96-wells microtiter plates and OD550 was measured every five
minutes. When reaching OD550 = 0.2, oxacillin was added in concentrations decreasing from 100
µg ml-1 down to 0.003 µg ml-1 in a two-fold dilution series. Zero antibiotic added was used as
controls. In some cases, 10 µg ml-1 of moenomycin was added together with oxacillin. The cells
were grown for 10 minutes in the presence of antibiotics before purified CbpD-B6 was added to
a final concentration of five µg ml-1. CbpD-sensitive cells were observed as a drop in OD550. For
the time kinetic experiments, oxacillin (0.8 µg ml-1) was added simultaneously to 11 parallel cell
cultures grown in a 96-well microtiter plate. Then CbpDB6 (1 µg ml-1) was added to the first well
at time zero, then to the second well after 1 minute and so on for 10 minutes.

For TEM and SEM analysis, strain RH425 was grown to OD550 = 0.2 and CbpD-B6 was added
to a final concentration of 0.5 µg ml-1. The enzyme was allowed to attack the cells for one
minute at 37°C before they were fixed in a mixture of 2% (v v-1) formaldehyde and 2.5% (v v-1)
glutaraldehyde. The cells were fixed on ice for one hour and then prepared for SEM and TEM
imaging as previously described by Straume et al.24. RH425 cells grown for two hours (from
OD550 = 0.1 to OD550 = 0.4) with 0.4 µg ml-1 moenomycin or 0.1 µg ml-1 oxacillin and SPH157
cells depleted for PBP2b (as described by Berg et al.8) was fixed and prepared for electron
microscopy in the same way.
To determine the binding pattern of CbpD-B6 on sensitive and immune S. pneumoniae
cells, a 10 ml cell culture of S. pneumoniae was split in two when reaching OD550 = 0.2. One half
was left untreated, while the other half was added oxacillin to a final concentration of 0.8 µg ml1

. Both cultures were incubated further for 10 minutes at 37°C before formaldehyde was added to

a final concentration of 2.5%. Both non-treated and oxacillin treated cells were fixed on ice for
one hour. The fixed cells were washed three times in 1/5 volume of PBS, before sfGFP-CbpDB6 (purified as described for CbpD-B6) was bound to the cell surface as described by Eldholm et
al.27. Briefly, 100 µl of cells were applied onto a microscope glass slide (inside a hydrophobic
frame made with a PAP pen) and cells were immobilized by incubation at room temperature for
five minutes. Non-bound cells were rinsed off the glass by PBS. Cells were then incubated in
100 µl PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 15 µg ml-1 sfGFP-CbpD-B6 for eight minutes at
room temperature. Non-bound sfGFP-CbpD-B6 was washed off the cells by rinsing the glass
slide by submerging the glass slide in five tubes each containing 40 ml PBS. Phase contrast
pictures and GFP fluorescence pictures were captured using a Zeiss AxioObserver with an
ORCAFlash4.0 V2 Digital CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) through a 100x PC
objective. An HPX 120 Illuminator was used as a light source for fluorescence microscopy.
Images were prepared in ImageJ.

Δpbp2a/Δpbp1b mutant (strain khb225) and Δpbp1a/Δpbp1b mutant (strain khb224) as well as a
Δpbp2b mutant (strain ds789) all developed the typical S1, R, S2 phases upon increasing

strain khb224 and ds789 compared to wild type cells.
