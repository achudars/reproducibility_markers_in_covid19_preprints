ABSTRACT

17

CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene interference (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa)

18

approaches hold promise for functional genomic studies and genome-wide screens in

19

human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). However, in contrast to CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease

20

approaches, the efficiency of CRISPRi/a depends on continued expression of the dead

21

Cas9 (dCas9) effector and guide RNA (gRNA), which can vary substantially depending

22

on transgene design and delivery. Here, we design new fluorescently labeled piggyBac

23

(PB) vectors to deliver robust and stable expression of multiplexed gRNAs. In addition,

24

we generate hPSC lines harboring AAVS1-integrated, inducible and fluorescent dCas9-

25

KRAB and dCas9-VPR transgenes to allow for accurate quantification and tracking of

26

cells that express both the dCas9 effectors and gRNAs. We then employ these systems

27

to target the TCF4 gene and conduct a rigorous assessment of expression levels of the

28

dCas9 effectors, gRNAs and targeted gene. Collectively, these data provide proof-of-

29

principle application of a stable, multiplexed PB gRNA delivery system that can be

30

widely exploited to further enable genome engineering studies in hPSCs. Paired with

31

diverse CRISPR tools including our dual fluorescence CRISPRi/a cell lines, this system

32

would facilitate functional dissection of individual genes and pathways as well as larger-

33

scale screens for studies of development and disease.

INTRODUCTION

36

CRISPR-Cas9 systems have revolutionized genome editing in myriad cell types

37

and organisms and ushered the development of variant technologies that utilize dCas9

38

fused to epigenetic modifiers which can be localized to a gene of interest upon

39

expression of a gRNA (Adli, 2018; Chavez et al., 2015; Gilbert et al., 2014). Two such

40

approaches are CRISPRi, which fuses dCas9 to transcriptional repressors, such as the

41

KRAB domain (Gilbert et al., 2014), and CRISPRa which fuses dCas9 to transcriptional

42

activators, such as the chimeric VPR domain (Chavez et al., 2015). These tools can be

43

deployed for both single and multiplexed gene manipulation and allow modulation of

44

gene expression in the absence of cellular toxicity caused by Cas9-mediated DNA

45

double-strand breaks (Aguirre et al., 2016). CRISPRi/a set-ups have been used

46

successfully in studies of cellular programming (Kearns et al., 2013), cellular

47

reprogramming (Liu et al., 2018; Weltner et al., 2018), in vivo gene manipulation (Zhou

48

et al., 2018), enhancer screens (Fulco et al., 2016), chemical screens (Jost et al., 2017),

49

and whole-genome genetic interaction mapping studies (Horlbeck et al., 2018). When

50

targeting populations of cells, gene repression through CRISPRi is reported to be more

51

homogeneous and efficient compared to Cas9 nuclease (Mandegar et al., 2016).

52

Indeed, while Cas9-nuclease strategies have been employed in genome-wide screens,

53

they are limited by heterogeneity in the targeted cell populations, which may include a

54

significant number of wild-type cells alongside cells with mixtures of indels that produce

55

partial loss or gain of function phenotypes, or truncated gene products which can

56

complicate interpretations (Mandegar et al., 2016). Furthermore, CRISPRi/a offers the

57

potential for conditional gene perturbation, allowing for the functional study of essential

58

genes (Gilbert et al., 2014) and reversibility of phenotypes. However, unlike genetic

59

knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 that requires a single indel formation event to permanently

60

disrupt gene function, successful CRISPRi/a requires persistent and uniform expression

61

of dCas9 effectors and gRNA across cell populations, an important consideration both in

62

single gene studies and whole-genome screens.

63

There is limited data on the stability of dCas9 effectors (Mandegar et al., 2016)

64

and studies report variability in the induction and expression of different promoters in

65

different loci due to de novo DNA methylation (Bertero et al., 2016a). Further, gRNA

66

delivery and expression require optimization in order to fully capitalize on the

67

multiplexing potential of CRISPRi/a. With regard to gRNA delivery, previous studies

68

have utilized transfection and selection of plasmid DNA (Balboa et al., 2015; Heman-

69

Ackah et al., 2016; Mandegar et al., 2016) transient transfection of in vitro transcribed

70

gRNA (González et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2017), lentiviral integration (Ho et al., 2017) or

71

piggyBac transposon-based integration (Li et al., 2017). In particular, piggyBac (PB)

72

delivery methods have the advantages of being easy to clone and deliver into hPSCs

73

and carry substantially larger payload compared to lentiviral vectors (Schertzer et al.,

74

2018; Wang et al., 2016). As a result, PB vectors are particularly applicable for studies of

75

parallel pathways or polygenic disease, enabling the perturbation of many genes with a

76

single delivery vehicle at minimal cost.

77

Here, we developed a new piggyBac vector system to enable rapid cloning and

78

stable delivery of multiple gRNAs for CRISPRi/a applications. We coupled this system

79

with genomically integrated and inducible dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR in hPSCs,

80

including a dual-fluorescent readout to readily quantify cells that express both gRNAs

81

and dCas9 variants in a population. We then quantified expression levels of the effector

82

components as well as a targeted gene, TCF4, at both the transcript and protein levels.

83

Our results confirm the utility of the dual-fluorescent readout and multiplexed PB gRNA

84

delivery system for CRISPRi/a that can now be broadly employed in hPSCs for gene

85

perturbation studies.

RESULTS

88

Generation of AAVS1 integrated and doxycycline-inducible dCas9-KRAB and

89

dCas9-VPR hPSC lines

90

To derive stable CRISPRi and CRISPRa hPSC lines, we cloned and introduced

91

all-in-one cassettes containing S. pyogenes dCas9 fused to the KRAB repressor domain

92

(Gilbert et al., 2013) or VPR activation domain (Chavez et al., 2015) into the AAVS1

93

safe-harbor locus of the XY embryonic stem cell line H1 (Thomson et al., 1998) via a

94

TALEN-mediated gene-trap approach that confers neomycin (G418) resistance to cells

95

upon on-target integration (González et al., 2014; Mandegar et al., 2016) (Figure 1A). In

96

both constructs, dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR expression is driven by the TRE3G

97

doxycycline inducible promoter (Takara Bio) and fused to Enhanced Green Fluorescent

98

Protein (EGFP) transcriptional reporters by an IRES sequence (dCas9-KRAB) or a T2A

99

self-cleaving peptide sequence (dCas9-VPR). Following selection with G418, dCas9-

100

KRAB and dCas9-VPR clones were assessed for EGFP expression and genotyped by

101

junction PCR (Figure S1A, B). From these data, dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR clones

102

were expanded and confirmed to have normal karyotypes and absence of mycoplasma

103

(data not shown).

104

To validate our CRISPRi/a hPSC lines, we first quantified EGFP fluorescence by

105

flow cytometry following 48 hours of doxycycline treatment. Doxycycline led to strong

106

induction of EGFP fluorescence, reaching 99% in both dCas9-VPR and dCas9-KRAB

107

hPSC lines (+48h; Figure 1B, C). 120 hours after washout of doxycycline, EFGP

108

fluorescence levels dropped to background levels in both the dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-

109

VPR lines (-120h; Figure 1B, C). As expected, we also observed strong induction of

110

dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR protein expression after doxycycline induction (Figure

111

1D, E) and loss of detectable dCas9 expression by 96 hours post-washout in dCas9-

112

KRAB cells and by 72 hours in dCas9-VPR cells (Figure 1D, E). The increased stability

113

of dCas9-KRAB and EGFP protein in dCas9-KRAB cells in comparison to dCas9-VPR

114

cells may be due to the presence of the WPRE (Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus Post-

115

transcriptional Response Element) in the 3´ UTR of the dCas9-KRAB construct (Figure

116

1A), which has been reported to increase transcript stability (Zufferey et al., 1999).

117

Similar to previous reports, dCas9 protein was not detected in the absence of

118

doxycycline (Mandegar et al., 2016)(Figure 1D, E). These data confirm that our AAVS1-

119

integrated dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR constructs exhibit robust induction and

120

reversibility of dCas9 expression in hPSCs.

121
122

Identification of the relevant transcriptional start site of TCF4 in hPSCs

123

To assess the potency of our dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR systems for gene

124

repression and activation, we targeted the TCF4 gene in hPSCs as an example. TCF4

125

plays important roles in development and TCF4 gene dysfunction has been implicated in

126

multiple

127

schizophrenia by GWAS (Jung et al., 2018; Quednow et al., 2014; Ripke et al., 2014).

128

Importantly, TCF4 has multiple alternatively-spliced transcripts (Sepp et al., 2011)

129

making it critical to identify the most relevant TCF4 isoform and its corresponding

130

transcriptional start site (TSS) to target with CRISPRi/a. Generally speaking, functional

131

gRNA design for CRISPRi/a applications has the added challenge that TSSs may not be

132

well annotated for a given cell type. We therefore first carried out western blot analysis of

133

TCF4 protein in hPSC lysates. As shown in Figure 2A, the most abundant and full-

134

length isoform migrated at approximately 72 kDa, which corresponds to the full-length

135

canonical TCF4 sequence (Sepp et al., 2011). To experimentally map the functional TSS

136

of this protein isoform, we utilized exon-specific RT-qPCR with an array of primers

137

targeting candidate TSS-harboring exons. RT-qPCR analysis revealed the most

138

dominantly expressed exon to be exon 3b of TCF4, which corresponds to the TCF4-B

139

transcript isoform (Figure 2B) (Sepp et al., 2011). Having established the dominant TSS

140

of TCF4 in hPSCs, we selected three gRNAs for CRISPRi (i1, i2, i3) and three gRNAs

141

for CRISPRa (a1, a2, and a3) that fall within the optimal window of 300 bp from the TSS

142

(Doench, 2017; Gilbert et al., 2014) using the CRISPR-ERA guide selection tool (Liu et

143

al., 2015)(Figure S2A).

144
145

Design and delivery of multi-gRNA piggyBac vectors in hPSCs

146

A noted strength of CRISPRi and CRISPRa is the ability to deliver multiple

147

gRNAs for enhanced targeting of one or several genes in the absence of DNA damage

148

(Jusiak et al., 2016). To facilitate stable delivery of multiple gRNAs in hPSCs, we

149

designed a new vector that incorporates the efficiency and ease of the piggyBac (PB)

150

transposase system (Chen et al., 2010) with a multiplex gRNA cloning system (Sakuma

151

et al., 2014). To do so, we cloned either the three CRISPRi gRNAs (i1, i2, i3) or

152

CRISPRa gRNAs (a1, a2, a3) targeting TCF4 into individual vectors and sequentially

153

assembled the final PB vector including mRFP and blasticidin resistance via Golden

154

Gate and Gateway cloning (Figure 2C). Of note, while we opted to introduce three

155

gRNAs per PB vector, the parental vectors allow for the cloning of up seven gRNAs in

156

tandem array (Sakuma et al., 2014) that can easily be introduced into our PB vectors.

157

Additionally, FRT sites flanking the mRFP and blasticidin cassettes (Figure 2C) allow for

158

removal of these selectable features by introduction of FLP recombinase, allowing for

159

future PB re-targeting events. With our workflow, the cloning of multiple gRNAs into

160

these vectors can be completed and confirmed via BamHI restriction digest within one

161

week (Figure S2B and Materials and Methods).

162

We next co-transfected the multi-gRNA PB vectors along with a plasmid

163

encoding the piggyBac transposase into dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR hPSC lines.

164

Following selection with blasticidin, individual dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR clones were

165

isolated and screened for high levels of uniform mRFP fluorescence (Figure 2D). We

166

then selected and expanded two independent dCas9-KRAB clones (dCas9-KRAB-PB

167

clones K1 and K2) and two independent dCas9-VPR clones (dCas9-VPR-PB clones V1

168

and V2) and assessed integrated PB copy number via droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Our

169

ddPCR analysis revealed approximately 14 and 31 PB copies in dCas9-KRAB-PB

170

clones K1 and K2, respectively, and approximately 13 and 34 PB copies dCas9-VPR-PB

171

clones V1 and V2, respectively (Figure 2E). At this stage, we also confirmed that both

172

dCas9-KRAB-PB and dCas9-VPR-PB cells harboring moderate levels of integrated PBs

173

(i.e., 13 - 34 copies) maintained pluripotency and tri-lineage potential (Figure S2C, D).

174

Thus, our multiplexed PB vectors can facilitate rapid cloning and efficient delivery of

175

gRNAs for CRISPRi/a applications in hPSCs.

176
177

Quantifying CRISPRi/a Component Expression in hPSCs

178

To quantify CRISPRi/a component expression, that is, the dCas9 effector and

179

gRNA levels, we treated dCas9-KRAB-PB and dCas9-VPR-PB clones with doxycycline

180

for 0, 24, and 48 hours and collected replicate and matched samples for side-by-side

181

clonal analysis via flow cytometry, western blot, and RT-qPCR (Figure 3A). For

182

CRISPRi, flow cytometric quantification of EGFP fluorescence of the two independent

183

dCas9-KRAB-PB clones showed high levels of EGFP fluorescence (99.9% for both K1

184

and K2 clones) and mRFP expression fluorescence (100% for both K1 and K2 clones)

185

after 48 hours of doxycycline induction (Figure 3B) indicating robust and uniform

186

expression of dCas9-KRAB and gRNA. In direct congruence with the EGFP and mRFP

187

fluorescence data, we observe strong induction of dCas9-KRAB protein in both K1 and

188

K2 clones (Figure 3C) and high levels of all three CRISPRi gRNAs by gRNA-specific

189

RT-qPCR (Figure 3D). Indeed, we observed gRNA expression levels between 1% and

190

nearly 100% of the levels of GAPDH transcripts. These results indicate that PB vectors

191

provide a consistent and reproducible means to express multiple gRNAs across cells in

192

a population using a single delivery vehicle.

193

In the case of CRISPRa, flow cytometric quantification of EGFP fluorescence of

194

the two independent dCas9-VPR-PB clones revealed only intermediate levels of EGFP

195

fluorescence (82% for clone V1 and 53% for clones V2; Figure 3E). The decreased

196

levels of EGFP expression in dCas9-VPR-PB clones contrasts with the high levels of

197

EGFP expression in the parental dCas9-VPR clone (Figure 1C), perhaps indicating a

198

CRISPRa gRNA- or PB-specific effect as prolonged doxycycline treatment in dCas9-

199

VPR cells without integrated PB vectors did not result in reduced EGFP levels (data not

200

shown). However, mRFP expression remained high in dCas9-VPR-PB cells, as

201

quantified by flow cytometry (100% for both clone V1 and V2). Direct assessment of

202

dCas9-VPR protein levels in clones V1 and V2 revealed strong induction upon

203

doxycycline treatment (Figure 3F), albeit to a lesser extent compared with dCas9-

204

KRAB-PB clones. Again, RT-qPCR confirmed robust and uniform expression of all three

205

CRISPRa gRNAs (Figure 3G). Interestingly, the expression levels of CRISPRi and

206

CRISPRa gRNAs i2 and a2 increased 4-6 fold upon expression of dCas9 by doxycycline

207

treatment (Figures 3D, G). It is possible that the presence of dCas9 selectively

208

increases gRNA stability by binding particular gRNAs with high affinity and protecting

209

them from degradation, perhaps by masking the 5´ end of the gRNA, as suggested by

210

previous studies (Jiang and Doudna, 2017). These results demonstrate that both dCas9-

211

effectors and multiplex gRNAs are efficiently expressed in our CRISPRi and CRISPRa

212

hPSC lines.

213
214

Quantification of TCF4 repression and activation at the transcript and protein level

215

Having established robust expression of our effector components, we next

216

sought to quantify levels of repression and activation of a target gene in hPSCs. To

217

quantify the efficiency of TCF4 repression by CRISPRi, we first analyzed TCF4 transcript

218

levels by RT-qPCR in dCas9-KRAB-PB clonal pairs. As shown in Figure 4A,

219

doxycycline induction resulted in rapid and significant repression of TCF4 transcripts

220

both clones K1 and K2, (averaged decreased of 18-fold at 24 hours and 200-fold at 48

221

hours). Comparison of TCF4 transcripts in clone K1 and K2 shows that K2 displays more

222

rapid repression, suggesting that CRISPRi potency may titrate with PB copy number

223

(Figure 2E). In contrast to the rapid decline of TCF4 transcripts, TCF4 protein was more

224

moderately decreased in both dCas9-KRAB clones, resulting in a reduction of 0.4-fold

225

after 24 hours and 2-fold after 48 hours of doxycycline treatment (Figure 4B). By

226

comparison, targeting of TCF4 for activation in dCas9-VPR-PB clones resulted in a 1.8-

227

and 1.6-fold averaged increase in transcript levels after 24 hours and 48 hours

228

doxycycline treatment, respectively (Figure 4C). TCF4 protein levels increased

229

approximately 2- and 1.3-fold after 24 and 48 hours of doxycycline induction,

230

respectively, in dCas9-VPR-PB cells (Figure 4D).

231

To confirm our results over longer induction time-points, we treated the dCas9-

232

KRAB-PB clone K1 with doxycycline for up to 96h and the dCas9-VPR clone V1 for up to

233

168h. As shown in Figure 4E, the 96h induction period for dCas9-KRAB-PB cells failed

234

to further decrease TCF4 protein levels (~3-fold reduction at 48h versus 2.5-fold

235

reduction after 96h). By contrast, continued doxycycline induction of dCas9-VPR

236

resulted in a steady increase of TCF4 protein over time, with a 20-fold increase after

237

168h (Figure 4E). These results are consistent with activation of TCF4 through

238

CRISPRa resulting in parallel activation of TCF4 transcript and protein expression levels,

239

and repression of TCF4 through CRISPRi leading to differing degrees of impact on

240

transcript and protein expression. These differences likely reflect endogenous gene

241

regulatory programs that remain notable considerations for CRISPRi/a applications.

242

Importantly, our data confirm robust and efficient transcript repression and activation of

243

the target gene, thus providing proof-of-principle data on the effectiveness of our

244

CRISPRi/a approach in hPSCs.

245
246

DISCUSSION

247

CRISPRi/a systems hold great potential for exploring gene function and

248

dissecting human disease mechanisms in hPSCs and hPSC-derived cell types, such as

249

cardiomyocytes (Mandegar et al., 2016) and neurons (Ho et al., 2017). Benefits of

250

CRISPRi/a over knockout strategies utilizing Cas9 nuclease include the ability to

251

conditionally perturb essential and multiple genes in the absence of DNA damage and

252

genetic instability (Ihry et al., 2018; Kosicki et al., 2018). However, in contrast to gene

253

perturbation by gene knockout with CRISPR-Cas9, gene modulation by CRISPRi and

254

CRISPRa approaches are dependent on sustained expression of the dCas9 effector and

255

gRNA.

256

Here, we developed a set of tools to facilitate multiplexed CRISPR-mediated

257

gene modulation in hPSCs. We find that our integrated dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR

258

constructs allow for reproducible and reversible induction of dCas9 alongside EGFP in

259

the vast majority of cells, consistent with previous reports (Mandegar et al., 2016). To

260

facilitate stable and multiplex gRNA expression, we designed and validated a drug-

261

selectable piggyBac vector with constitutive mRFP fluorescence to visualize and track

262

gRNA-expressing cells. Thus, dual monitoring of both EGFP and mRFP fluorescence

263

allows for quantification of the percentage of CRISPRi/a competent cells in a population.

264

This may be particularly important for downstream functional studies and screens in

265

differentiated cell types derived from hPSCs, where cell-to-cell variation is likely to

266

increase. Further, some commonly used mammalian promoters are reported to be

267

silenced over time by DNA methylation (Bertero et al., 2016b; Norrman et al., 2010) and

268

lentiviral vectors, commonly used to introduce gRNAs, can also be subject to shutdown

269

(Xia et al., 2007).

270

With regard to gRNA expression, we find that CAG-promoter driven PB vectors

271

support sustained gRNA and reporter expression in hPSCs. Importantly, we confirmed

272

high expression levels of 3 independent gRNAs in the multiplexed system,

273

demonstrating that PB vectors provide a dependable, rapid and inexpensive delivery

274

vehicle for transgene expression. Specifically, we anticipate these vectors will be useful

275

for rapid and multiplexed expression of gRNAs in hPSCs for perturbation analysis at the

276

single gene and whole genome levels, both in CRISPRi/a contexts, as presented here,

277

and in CRISPR knockout schemes with Cas9 nuclease or Cas9-fused base editors

278

(Billon et al., 2017).

279

In our examination of CRISPRa potency, we observed a near 1-to-1 congruency

280

between level of transcriptional activation and protein overexpression. However, in our

281

assessment of CRISPRi, we find that TCF4 transcript levels drop precipitously,

282

approximately 200-fold within 48 hours of dCas9-KRAB induction, while protein levels

283

were reduced merely 2-fold. This discrepancy may arise in cases where only a small

284

percentage of the expressed transcripts are needed to maintain cellular protein levels or

285

cases when the protein is more stable than the transcript (Schwanhäusser et al., 2011).

286

Such transcription-translation discrepancies are mediated by endogenous regulatory

287

programs that vary from cell-type to cell-type (Moritz et al., 2019) and remain an

288

important aspect to consider in both single gene studies and whole genome screens with

289

CRISPRi and CRISPRa strategies.

290

Collectively, our newly designed multi-gRNA PB vectors are vehicles for robust,

291

sustained gRNA expression in hPSCs. Further, the coupling of these tools with our dual-

292

fluorescence dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR systems facilitates accurate quantification

293

and tracking of CRISPRi/a components across cells in a population. We anticipate these

294

tools will facilitate both single and multiplexed gene perturbation studies and screens in

295

hPSCs and other cell types for functional interrogation of development and disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

298
299

Plasmid construction

300

To generate the dCas9-KRAB-IRES-EGFP AAVS1 targeting plasmid pT077, parental

301

plasmid pHR-TRE3G-KRAB-dCas9-IRES-GFP (a gift from Jesse Engreitz, Broad

302

Institute) was cloned by Gibson assembly into the backbone fragment of plasmid

303

pGEP116 that contains AAVS1 homology arms and the doxycycline-responsive activator

304

rTTA driven by a constitutive CAG promoter (Sellgren et al., 2019). To generate the

305

dCas9-VPR-T2A-EGFP AAVS1 targeting plasmid (pT076), the dCas9-VPR cassette

306

from plasmid SP-dCas9-VPR (Addgene 63798, (Chavez et al., 2015)) was fused by

307

Gibson assembly with a PCR fragment containing a T2A-EGFP-NLS cassette (from

corresponding to gRNA target sequences (Supplemental Table S1) were cloned via BpiI

310

into

311

pGEP179_pX330K (this study) according to kit instructions (Addgene Kit#1000000055,

312

Sakuma et al., 2014). The pGEP179_pX330K plasmid is a modified entry vector

313

generated by cloning the BsaI-pU6-sgRNA-BsaI fragment from pX330A-1x3 (Sakuma et.

314

al., 2014) into a slightly modified MCS of the attL-containing entry vector, pENTR1A

315

(Invitrogen). These gRNA-containing pX330S and pGEP179_pX330K plasmids were

316

then assembly by Golden Gate cloning to form a single entry vector. This entry vector

317

was then cloned by Gateway cloning into the piggyBac donor destination plasmid

318

pGEP163 that contains piggyBac ITRs for transposase-mediated insertion, a CAG

319

promoter driving an mRFP-T2A-BLASTR cassette, and attR sites Gateway cloning to

320

create CRISPRi multi-gRNA plasmid pPN441 and CRISPRa multi-gRNA plasmid

321

pPN440. Donor plasmid pGEP163 was constructed by fusing a fragment of plasmid PB-

322

CA (Addgene 20960, (Woltjen et al. 2009) containing the piggyBac ITRs and a CAG

323

promoter with a synthetic gene block containing FRT-mRFP-T2A-BLASTR-SV40 pA-FRT

324

(IDT). The versions of pPN441 and pPN440 plasmids used in this study were initially

325

created by an earlier cloning strategy that was replaced by the strategy described above

326

to generate the same pPN441 and pPN440 plasmids more rapidly.

Cell culture and gene targeting

329

The human embryonic stem cell line H1 (WA01) was obtained from WiCell Research

330

Institute (Madison, WI) (Thomson et al., 1998). Stem cells were grown in either mTeSR1

331

medium (Stem Cell Technologies 05850) or StemFlex medium (ThermoFisher

332

A3349401) on Geltrex (Life Technologies A1413301) coated plates under conditions

333

previously described (Hazelbaker et al., 2017). Throughout culturing, cells were tested

334

to confirm the absence of mycoplasma contamination (Lonza MycoAlert LT07-418). To

335

integrate the dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR constructs into the AAVS1 locus, 2.5 x 106

336

cells were co-transfected with 10ug of pT077 (KRAB) or pT076 (VPR), 1.5 µg AAVS1

337

TALEN L (Addgene 59025) and 1.5 µg AAVS1 TALEN R (Addgene 59026) via the Neon

338

Electroporation System (ThermoFisher) at 1050 mV, 30 ms, 2 pulses. For the first round

339

of clonal selection, the transfected cells were plated at low-density (8,000 cells in a 10cm

340

dish) under G418 selection (50ug/ml, Gibco 10131035) to allow for single-cell colony

341

formation (~10 days). Importantly, cells with the dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR cassettes

342

are kept under selection with G418 for the duration of culture and experiments to protect

343

against shutdown of the AAVS1 integrated transgenes. In this strategy, colonies are

344

picked and deposited into a 96-well plate and when sufficiently dense, the 96-well plate

345

is triplicated to create 3 plates of identical clones. Plate 1 is frozen for storage, plate 2 is

346

treated with doxycycline (Sigma, D9891-25g) at a final concentration of 2 µg/ml 24 hours

347

after duplication for visualization of EGFP+ colonies (with high levels of EGFP

348

expression serving as a proxy for high dCas9 expression), and plate 3 is maintained for

349

expansion and banking of EGFP+ colonies (n=6) while the analysis of plate 2 is

350

performed. For integration of the multiplex PB vectors, 2.5 x 106 dCas9-KRAB and

351

dCas9-VPR cells were transfected with 5 µg of pPN441 (CRISPRi multi-gRNA plasmid)

352

and 5 µg of pPN440 (CRISPRa multi-gRNA plasmid), respectively, with 1 µg of

353

transposase plasmid (System Biosciences #PB210PA-1) under conditions described

354

above. 24 hours after transfection, cells are treated with blasticidin at a final

355

concentration of 2 µg/ml for 12-15 days to select for positive piggyBac integrants and

356

allow clearing of free plasmid. Genomic DNA for PCR-based genotyping and piggyBac

357

copy number analysis by ddPCR was isolated via the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit

358

(Qiagen 69504). For doxycycline induction of dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR, cells are

359

treated with 2 µg/ml doxycycline and pelleted at indicated time points.

360
361

Western blot analysis

362

To isolate protein for western blot analysis, hPSCs were lysed using Pierce IP lysis

363

buffer (Life Technologies 87787) with protease inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich 11836153001).

364

20 μg total protein, as determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific

365

23227), was loaded onto Bolt 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris Plus gels (Invitrogen). Gels were

366

transferred overnight at 4ºC to nitrocellulose membranes in 1X NuPAGE transfer buffer

367

(Invitrogen) with 10% methanol. The following antibodies were used for western blot

368

analysis: Cas9 (Diagenode C15310258, 1:1000) TCF4 (Abcam ab217668, 1:500),

369

GAPDH (EMD MAB374; 1:2000), α-rabbit HRP-linked F(ab’)2 (GE Life Sciences

370

NA9340; 1:5000) and α-mouse HRP-linked F(ab’)2 (GE Life Sciences NA9310; 1:5000).

371

Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence with the SuperSignal West Femto kit

372

(Pierce) and imaged and quantified with a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (BioRad). For

373

quantification of Cas9 protein in dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR parental clones, 1.2 μg

374

total protein was analysed with Cas9 (Diagenode C15310258, 1:400) and GAPDH (EMD

375

MAB374; 1:50) antibodies using the Wes capillary immunoassay system (ProteinSimple)

376
377

Flow cytometry

378

Flow cytometry was performed at the Broad Institute Flow Facility on a CytoFLEX flow

379

cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Cells were treated with 10 mM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632)

380

for 4 to 6 hours prior to flow. For each experiment, 100,000 events were recorded and

381

analyzed with FCS Express 6 software (De Novo Software)

382
383

Genomic DNA isolation and genotyping PCR and ddPCR

384

Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from hPSCs with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit

385

according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). For genotyping of WT AAVS1 in

386

dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-VPR clones, PCR of gDNA was performed with primer pair

387

GE222 and GE668. For genotyping of gene targeted AAVS1 in dCas9-KRAB cells, PCR

388

was performed with primer pair GE222 and GE586 for 5´ junctions and primer pair

389

GE819 and GE668 for 3´ junctions. For genotyping gene targeted AAVS1 in dCas9-VPR

390

cells, PCR was performed with primer pair GE222 and GE332 for 5´ junctions and

391

primer pair GE233 and GE668 for 3´ junctions. For ddPCR of gDNA to quantify piggyBac

392

copy number in dCas9-KRAB-PB and dCas9-VPR-PB clones, 20 μl reactions were

393

prepared with ddPCR Supermix for Probes (no dUTP) (Bio-Rad, #1863024) with probes

394

specific to mRFP and control gene RPP30 according to manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-

395

Rad). Droplets were generated using a QX100 Droplet Generator and PCR was

396

performed on a C1000 Touch thermal-cycler (Bio-Rad) followed by sample streaming

397

onto a QX100 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad). Quantification was performed with QuantaSoft

398

software. Primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S1.

399
400

RT-qPCR

401

Total RNA from hPSCs was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Reverse

402

Transcription cDNA synthesis reactions were performed on 0.2 μg -2 μg total RNA with

403

iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

404

Quantitative PCR reactions were performed the iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix

405

(BioRad) and quantified by the ΔΔcT method on a CFX384 Real-Time System (Bio-

406

Rad). Primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table S1.

408

Embryoid body differentiation and immunostaining

409

Embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated as previously described (Hazelbaker et al.,

410

2017). For immunostaining, hPSC colonies and EBs were fixed with 4%

411

paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 mins at room temperature (RT), blocked and

412

permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 and 4% serum in PBS for 1 hr at RT and incubated

413

with the appropriate primary antibody at RT. Following primary antibody incubation,

414

cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody

415

(Alexa Fluor 488 or 594, 1:500, Invitrogen) for 1 hr. Cells were then washed with PBS

416

and incubated with DAPI before imaging at 20X magnification. The following primary

417

antibodies were used: OCT4 (R&D Systems AF1759; 1:250), SSEA-4 (SCBT SC21704;

418

1:250), TRA-1-60 (SCBT SC21705; 1:200), AFP (Sigma A8452; 1:250), SMA (Sigma

419

A2547; 1:2000), β-III Tubulin (R&D Systems MAB1195; 1:3000).
