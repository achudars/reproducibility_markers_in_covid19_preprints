ABSTRACT:

It has long been noted that the cell arrangements in epithelia, regardless of their origin, exhibit
some striking regularities: first, the average number of cell neighbours at the apical side is
(close to) six. Second, the average apical cell area is linearly related to the number of
neighbours, such that cells with larger apical area have on average more neighbours, a relation
termed Lewis’ law. Third, Aboav-Weaire’s (AW) law relates the number of neighbours that a
cell has to that of its direct neighbours. While the first rule can be explained with topological
constraints in contiguous polygonal lattices, and the second rule (Lewis’ law) with the
minimisation of the lateral contact surface energy, the driving forces behind the AW law have
remained elusive. We now show that also the AW law emerges to minimise the lateral contact
surface energy in polygonal lattices by driving cells to the most regular polygonal shape, but
while Lewis’ law regulates the side lengths, the AW law controls the angles. We conclude that
global apical epithelial organization is the result of energy minimisation under topological
constraints.

INTRODUCTION
Epithelia are polarized tissues. This means that cell properties change along the apical-basal axis (Fig.
1a). In particular, cells adhere tightly on the apical side via an adhesion belt composed of Cadherins,
while they bind to the extracellular matrix on the basal side. When viewed from the apical side, the
tissue appears as a contiguous polygonal lattice (Fig. 1b). The organisation of the polygonal lattice
may appear random at first sight, but it has previously been noted to follow certain phenomenological
laws. First, even though the fraction of cells with a certain number of neighbours differs hugely
between epithelial tissues (Fig. 1c), the average number of neighbours, 𝑛̅, is always close to six (Fig.
1d) [1-7] because of topological constraints in 2D contiguous polygonal lattices [4, 8]. In fact, in the
limit of an infinite number of polygons, the average number of neighbours is exactly

𝑛̅ = 6,

(1)

if three cells meet at each vertex; this can be derived from Euler's formula, v-e+f =2, which formulates
a relationship between the number of vertices, v, edges, e, and faces, f. Second, the average apical area
is linearly related to the number of cell neighbours, n, a relation termed Lewis' law (Fig. 1e), i.e.

̅̅̅̅
𝐴𝑛

𝑛−2

̅̅̅̅

Here, 𝐴
𝑛 refers to the average apical area of cells with n neighbours, and 𝐴 refers to the average
apical area of all cells in the tissue. We have recently shown that Lewis’ law can be explained with a
minimisation of the lateral cell-cell contact surface energy (Kokic et al, submitted). The lateral contact
surface energy is minimal if the cell-cell contact area, and thus the combined cell perimeter is
minimised. For a given apical area, the cell perimeter is minimal if the polygons are the most regular.
To form a contiguous polygonal lattice from regular polygons, these need to all have the same
side/edge length. However, for the same polygon area, side lengths differ between polygon types (Fig.
1f). In epithelial tissues, apical areas vary as a result of several processes, most prominently growth

and cell division. By following the relationship between polygon area and polygon type as stipulated
by Lewis' law (Eq. 2), the difference in side lengths is minimised between cells. However, equal side
lengths are only achieved if the areas followed a quadratic rather than a linear relationship,

This quadratic relationship only emerges in case of a larger variability in apical areas than previously
observed in epithelia. We confirmed this prediction by increasing the area variability in the
Drosophila larval wing disc, which led to the predicted quadratic relationship (Kokic et al,
submitted).

Finally, Aboav-Weaire's law (AW law) formulates a relationship between the number of neighbours,
n, that a cell has and the average number of neighbours, 𝑚𝑛 , of its direct neighbours (Fig. 1g). Aboav
[9] empirically observed for grains in a polycrystal that

𝑚𝑛 ∙ 𝑛 = 5𝑛 + 8.

Eq. 4 has previously been found to be a close approximation to the neighbour relationships in
epithelial tissue in both plants [10-12] and animals [7] (Fig. 1h). However, Eq. 4 cannot explain

regular hexagonal packings, where 𝑚6 = 6 ≠ 5 + 6. Weaire suggested a refinement of the form

𝑚𝑛 ∙ 𝑛 = 5𝑛 + 6 + 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑛),

where 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑛) = ∑∞

cells with 𝑛 neighbours [13]. Eq. 5 applies to hexagonal lattices as 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑛) = 0, and reduces to Eq. 4
for 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑛) = 2. Efforts to explain the mathematical basis of Eqs. 4 and 5 have led to a wide range of

alternative formulations [14], but no physical or mathematical argument has so far been established to
explain the experimental observations.

In the following, we will show that the emergence of the AW law in epithelia can be explained with
the minimisation of the lateral contact surface energy. We previously showed that Lewis' law ensures
that the side lengths of the different polygon types are the most similar, so that the different polygon
types can fit within a polygonal lattice as the most regular polygons. To form a regular polygon also
the internal angles of the polygon must match the polygon type, and to form a contiguous lattice, the
internal angles around the shared vertex of adjacent cells must add to 360°. We show that this second
constraint results in the AW law.

RESULTS

The emergence of the AW law can be explained with the minimisation of lateral surface energy

In the first step, we sought to test whether the AW law could be explained with the minimisation of
the lateral contact surface energy. We have previously introduced the simulation framework
LBIBCell [15] to simulate epithelial tissues (Kokic et al, submitted). LBIBCell represents tissues in
a 2D plane, and can thus be used to simulate the apical tissue dynamics (Fig. 2a). The simulation
framework offers high spatial resolution, i.e., it represents the boundaries of all cells separately such
that cells can unbind and the spatial resolution is sufficiently high that cell edges can be curved.
Cortical tension as well as cell-cell adhesion are implemented via springs between vertices. The fluid
inside and outside the cells is represented explicitly and the fluid dynamics are approximated by the
Lattice Boltzmann method. The interaction between the elastic cell boundaries and the fluid is
realised via an immersed boundary condition.

The biological parameters in the simulation are the growth rate, the cell division threshold (i.e. the
apical cell area, at which the cell divides), as well as the spring constants representing cortical tension
and cell-cell adhesion. We have previously adjusted these to recapitulate the quantitative data from
the Drosophila larval wing disc, a model epithelial tissue, and we have re-used the same setup as
described before (Kokic et al, submitted; Supplementary Material, Table S1). When we simulate the
Drosophila larval wing disc dynamics while dividing cells either perpendicular to their longest axis
(Hertwig’s rule [16]) (Fig. 2b, orange line) or randomly (Fig. 2b, cyan line), the resulting lattice
results in polygonal relationships that are close to the AW law (Fig. 2b, black line). The deviation of
the simulations from the AW law is similar to that observed for epithelial tissues (Fig. 2c). Thus, if we
determine the parameters a and b for which

𝑚𝑛 ∙ 𝑛 = 𝑎 ∙ 𝑛 + 𝑏

(5)

best fits the simulations and the data, the inferred values differ in a similar way from those of the AW
law (a=5, b=8) [9]. We note that the 𝑏 parameter deviates more than the 𝑎 parameter. Weaire linked
the 𝑏 parameter to the variance in the observed polygon distribution, i.e. 𝑏 = 6 + 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑛) (Eq. 5)
[13]. However, 6 + 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑛) does not correlate with the parameter 𝑏 that we infer from the data (Fig.
2d), thus ruling out such a relationship. Given the definition of variance, the hexagon fraction declines
with the variance of the polygon distribution (Fig. 2e), and 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑛) = 2 and thus 𝑏 = 8 as in Aboav’s
formulation is observed only for tissues with low hexagon fraction (~30%), which are rare (Fig. 1c).
We conclude that the LBIBCell simulations generate a distribution of cell-cell contacts that lead to
similar parameters for the AW law as observed in epithelia, but that differ from those specified by
Aboav and Weaire. This suggests that the AW law could be explained with a minimisation of the
lateral contact surface energy. But why would energy minimisation result in neighbour arrangements
that follow the AW law?

Perfect polygonal lattices do not follow Aboav’s law, but match Weaire’s law

To understand the underlying constraint that leads to the particular form of the AW law, we consider
perfect polygonal lattices made of regular polygons. The simplest case is a perfect hexagonal lattice
(Fig. 3a, red). Here, all polygons must have the same area. To generate other regular lattices, cells
with the appropriate areas must be placed in the correct relative position within the polygonal lattice.
The relative areas of the different polygon types must follow the quadratic law (Eq. 3) so that all
polygons in the lattice have the same side length. In addition, the internal angles of the cells that meet
at a vertex must add up to 360° (Fig. 3b). The internal angles of a regular polygon with n neighbours
(Fig. 3c) are given by

𝜃𝑛 =

𝑛−2
∙
𝑛

180°,

(6)

and only in few regular configurations, the angles at each vertex will add up to 360° (Fig. 3a).
Consider for instance the case of a lattice made of repetitive elements with one square and two
octagons: the 90° angle of a square and the 135° angles of two regular octagons (Fig. 3c) add up to
360° at each vertex (Fig. 3a). If in addition, the octagons have about four times the area of the square
(Eq. 3), a regular lattice emerges (Fig. 3a, blue). On the contrary, if the areas of neighbouring cells do
not match such requirements, irregular lattices emerge (Fig. 3d).

As noted above, in a hexagonal lattice the average number of neighbours is six, i.e., 𝑚6 = 6 ≠ 5 +

(Fig. 3e, red triangle), which violates Aboav’s law (Eq. 4, Fig. 3e, black line), but matches Weaire’s
law (Eq. 5, Fig. 3e, red line). Also, the other arrangements that result in perfect polygonal lattices
(Fig. 3a) deviate from Aboav’s law (Eq. 4, black line), but match Weaire’s law (Eq. 5, coloured lines)
rather well (Fig. 3e). These perfect lattices also all emerge in LBIBCell tissue simulations when
adhesive circles with the appropriate relative areas are placed at the appropriate relative positions in a
grid (Fig. 3a, coloured lattices) and thus represent the configuration with the lowest lateral surface

energy. This shows that not all configurations that minimise the lateral contact surface area follow
Aboav’s law.

In summary, regular polygonal lattices follow Weaire’s law more closely than Aboav’s law (Fig. 3e),
while epithelial tissues follow Aboav’s law more closely than Weaire’s law (Fig. 2c,d). What is
special then about epithelial tissues, and what is the underlying physical principle that leads to these
regularities?

The AW law in epithelial tissues

In an epithelial tissue, the apical areas are predetermined by several active processes, including cell
growth, cell division, and interkinetic nuclear migration. As a result, the position of cells with a
certain area does not follow a pattern that would allow the emergence of a contiguous lattice made
from regular polygons. But, why would these lattices follow the AW law?

According to Euler’s formula, cells have on average six neighbours [4, 8]. The plot of 𝑚𝑛 ∙ 𝑛 with
𝑚𝑛 = 6 versus n is reasonably close to the AW law (Fig. 4a, black line), but clearly deviates (Fig. 4a,
green line). In a contiguous lattice, cells have to meet a further constraint, in that at each vertex point,
the combined angle must be 360° (Fig. 3b). At each of the n vertices, the neighbouring cells should
then have a combined angle of 360° - 𝜃𝑛 (Fig. 4b, inset). The average angle, 𝜃𝑚 =

This relationship approximates the AW law for neighbour numbers close to n = 5 rather well, but
deviates for larger and smaller neighbour numbers (Fig. 4a, yellow line). We note that the internal
angle of regular polygons, 𝜃𝑛 , depends non-linearly on the polygon type n (Eq. 6, Fig. 4b). As a
consequence, two cells, whose angles at a vertex add up to 2𝜃𝑚 yield a different 𝑚𝑛 depending on
whether their angles are very similar or very different. If we take this non-linear effect into account
(see Supplementary Information for details), and integrate within sensible physiological limits, i.e.
𝜃min = 60°, the smallest internal angle of a regular polygon (triangle), and 𝜃max =

(360°−𝜃min )

the internal angle of a regular dodecagon (12-gon), we obtain

which yields a rather close fit to the AW law for larger 𝑛 (Fig. 4c, grey line). In the limit of 𝑛 → ∞,

which is close to the parameters 𝑎 = 5 and 𝑏 = 8 in the AW law as given by Eq. 4 (Fig. 4c, black

simulations (Fig. 2c). Aboav's empirical values 𝑎 = 5 and 𝑏 = 8 are obtained with 𝜃min = 50.4° and
𝜃max = 160.7°, the lower bound of which is plausible only if trigons become distorted.

For small 𝑛, Eq. 8 predicts larger values for 𝑚𝑛 than what is observed. So, what happens for smaller
𝑛? Consider a regular triangle. To meet the angle constraint, it requires neighbouring polygons that

each have 12 neighbours (Fig. 3a, purple). To maintain a lattice of equilateral polygons, this would
require a tissue with a large variability in cell area (Eq. 3), and a strict pattern of large and small cells
(Fig. 3a, purple). Such tissues are unlikely to emerge from biological processes. In the case of more
physiological variabilities in apical cell areas, a triangular cell will border cells that have a smaller
area than what is required for a regular dodecagon (n=12) according to the quadratic law (Eq. 3). As a
consequence, such neighbouring dodecagonal cells would have a smaller side length than the
triangular cell. To fit into a contiguous lattice, the polygons would then become stretched and their
internal angles would no longer correspond to that of a regular polygon. Alternatively, the neighbours
can assume a lower neighbour number than 12. Also in this case, the internal angles can no longer
reflect that of a regular polygon as they would no longer add to 360°.

Accordingly, we extended the above formalism to allow for an irregular central polygon that deviates
from the perfect internal angle 𝜃𝑛 by an angle 𝜃i (Fig. 4d, inset; see Supplementary Information for
details). In the limit of 𝑛 → ∞, we recover the same value for the parameter 𝑎 as for the regular
polygon case (Eq. 9), but 𝑏 now depends also on the maximal value of the deviatory angle 𝜃i . We
obtain an excellent fit to the AW law (a=5, b=8, Fig. 4d, black line) when we use 𝜃min = 360° −
𝜃𝑛 − 𝜃i − 𝜃max and 𝜃max = 151.3°, and set the symmetric upper bounds of the angle mismatch to
|𝜃i− | = 𝜃i+ = 0.59

where

is the upper limit to maintain convexity (Fig. 4d, red line).

In fact, there is sufficient parametric freedom to reproduce all measured values of a and b (Fig. 2c) by
adjusting the integration bounds for the angles, 𝜃min and 𝜃max , and the upper bounds 𝜃i− , 𝜃i+ for the
angle deviation 𝜃i . Thus, the neighbour relationships in the Drosophila larval wing disc (a=4.76,
b=8.34, grey) deviate slightly from the classical AW law (Eq. 4, Fig. 5a, black), but can be
reproduced very well by the model (Fig. 5a, red line), and the predicted upper bound, |𝜃i− | = 𝜃i+ =

in the angle deviation matches that observed in the tissue very well (Fig. 5b). Importantly,

even though we introduced the irregularity assumption to explain the neighbour relationships of cells
with few neighbours, it applies to all polygon types. In agreement with this, the great majority of

epithelial cells deviate from a regular shape as measured by their ellipticity, and the irregularity of the
apical sides of epithelial cells does not dependent on the cells’ neighbour number (Fig. 5c).

Much as the internal angles, we expect the side lengths to deviate from that of a regular polygon. In a
regular polygonal lattice, all side lengths should be equal (Eq. 3, Fig. 5d, yellow line), and the average
normalised side lengths are indeed close to one (Fig. 5d). Single cells mostly deviate from these
averages, much as only the average area per polygon type follows Lewis’ law (Eq. 2, Fig. 5e, black
line). There are two sources for the observed irregularity. For one, the cellular processes result in a
spatial distribution of apical areas in epithelia that are not consistent with the requirements of regular
polygonal lattices (Fig. 3a). Secondly, apical areas in epithelia follow a continuous area distribution
(Fig. 5f, black line) while the quadratic law (Eq. 3) specifies discrete optimal areas for each polygon
type (Fig. 5f, yellow lines). With regard to the second point, we indeed observe that cell shape, side
lengths, and angles deviate the least from that of a regular polygon when a cell’s neighbour number
corresponds to the apical area according to the linear Lewis’ law (Eq. 2, Fig. 5g-i, black line) or the
quadratic law (Eq. 3, Fig. 5g-i, yellow line).

CONCLUSION

We conclude that the AW law, like Lewis’ law, emerges in epithelial tissues because cells minimise
the overall lateral surface energy and thus the combined cell perimeter. By following the relationship
between polygon area and polygon type as stipulated by Lewis' law (Eq. 2) or the quadratic law (Eq.
3), the difference in side lengths is minimised between cells. By following the neighbour relationships
that are described by the phenomenological AW law, the internal angles are closest to that of a regular
polygon while adding to 360° at each vertex. Both the linear Lewis’ law and the AW law deviate from
the curve predicted for a regular polygonal lattice. Regular polygonal lattices, however, require strict
patterns of correctly sized cells. Given that cell growth and cell division processes result in a more

variable spatial distribution of apical cell sizes, these cannot give rise to a regular polygonal lattice.
The observed lattices therefore represent a trade-off to achieve the most regular cell shapes in a
contiguous lattice with differently-sized apical areas.

METHODS

Image Processing
Cell boundaries and cell properties (cell area, polygon type, ellipse fit axes) were obtained in (Kokic
et al., submitted). In addition, the side lengths and the internal angles of all cells were extracted using
EpiTools [5] and the Fiji [17] plugin Tissue Analyzer [18]. To this end, the EpiTools source code was
modified to also export the IDs of the 𝑛𝑖 neighbours of a cell to permit the calculation of 𝑚𝑛 . R
scripts were used to extract and analyse data, calculate statistics, and plot the results.

Set-Up of the LBIBCell simulations
The LBIBCell simulations were set up as described in detail before (Kokic et al, submitted) and is
summarised in the Supplementary Material.

Figure legends

Figure 1: Principles of Epithelial Organisation
(a) A cartoon of an epithelial tissue. The tissue is polarized with an apical and basal side. At the apical
side cells adhere tightly via adhesion junctions (green). Nuclei are depicted in pink.
(b) The epithelial cells (denoted as faces - f) form a contiguous polygonal lattice on the apical side.
Typically, three edges, e, meet in a vertex, v.
(c) Tissues differ widely in the frequency of neighbour numbers. The legend provides the measured
average number of cell neighbours for each tissue and the references to the primary data [1-7]. Data
points for n < 3 were removed as they must present segmentation artefacts. The tissue samples are:
Chick neural tube epithelium (cNT) [2], Drosophila eye disc (EYE) [2], Drosophila peripodal
membrane from the larval eye disc (dPE), Drosophila larval wing disc (dWL) [1-6, 19] (Kokic et al,
submitted), Drosophila pre-pupal wing disc (dWP) [1, 2], Drosophila mutant wing pre-pupa (dMWP:
the expression of myosin II was reduced in the wing disc epithelium by expressing an UAS-zipperRNAi using the C765-Gal4 line) [2], and Drosophila pupal wing disc (dPW) [1]. In case of the
Drosophila peripodal membrane from the larval eye disc (dPE), the numbers indicate the
developmental age as the number of ommatidial rows that have formed. In case of the Drosophila
pupal wing disc (dPW) [2], TPx indicates subsequent, but not further specified pupal time points [1];
30h and 48h specifies the time post puparium formation.
(d) The measured average number of cell neighbours is close to the topological requirement 𝑛̅ = 6 in
all tissues; see panel c for the colour code.
(e) The relative average cell area,

is linearly related to the number of neighbours, n, and follows

Lewis’ law (Eq. 2, black line) in all reported tissues. The colour code is as in panel c, but data is
available only for a subset of those tissues. Few cells with more than 7 neighbours have been
measured and estimates of the mean areas are therefore unreliable (shaded part).
(f) The normalised side length of a regular polygon with n vertices for a fixed area.

(g) The AW law formulates a relationship between the number of neighbours, n, that a cell has and
the average number of neighbours, 𝑚𝑛 , that its direct neighbours have. The product 𝑚𝑛 ∙ 𝑛 can be
determined by summing over all 𝑛 neighbours.

adherens junctions (marked in green), which are located below the apical surface. Cell boundaries are
geometrically highly resolved and cell boundaries and cell-cell junctions are modelled with elastic
springs. The cartoon and legend are reproduced with modifications from (Kokic et al, submitted).

Figure S1: Illustration of a cell neighbourhood with regular central cell.
Consider the case of a regular polygon with n edges in the centre of a local epithelial cell
neighbourhood. The interior angles of a regular polygon are given by
θn = π

n−2
.
n

(1)

Inversely, the number of edges can be obtained from the interior angles as
n=

2π
.
π − θn

Assuming that all junctions are tri-cellular as illustrated in Fig. S1, and given θn , the average angle
left for the two neighbouring cells is
θm =

θ1 + θ 2
2π − θn

at each vertex. If θ1 = θ2 and also both neighbour cells are regular polygons, the mean neighbour
number of all neighbours of a cell with n neighbours follows as
mn =

π − θm

However, in most polygonal lattices, θ1 and θ2 differ. We are therefore now averaging over all
allowed values of θ1 :

where
n1 =

with
θ2 = 2π − θn − θ1 .
The average is taken over a physiological range [θmin , θmax ] (to be specified later):

Notice that this definition is symmetric in θ1 , θ2 , i.e., one could also average over θ2 instead. The
integral in Eq. 8 can be cast into the form

Therefore, after some basic algebra, Eq. 8 can be evaluated to
mn =

π − θmin θn − (π − θmax )
ln
.
θmax − θmin
π − θmax θn − (π − θmin )

(13)

Eq. 13 requires careful selection of the integration bounds θmin , θmax , which can be functions of
n in general. Trigons are the polygons with the lowest possible neighbour number, and assuming
regular polygons, a consistent choice for the minimum allowable angle is
θ=

π
.

(14)

For the upper bound, a natural choice appears to be
θ=

2π − θ

= π
2

(15)

(corresponding to n = 12), as cells with more than 12 edges are hardly ever observable in epithelial
tissue. Since this rationale applies to both angles θ1 and θ2 alike, and since they are coupled via
Eq. 7, the bounds must be applied symmetrically, yielding

θmin = max θ, 2π − θn − θ
(16)

θmax = min θ, 2π − θn − θ .
As long as n ≤ 12, this evaluates to θmin = 7π/6 − θn and θmax = 5π/6 (Fig. S2). With these
integration bounds, Eq. 13 becomes

This relationship approximates Aboav–Weaire’s empirical law very well for n ≥ 6 (Fig. S3). Aboav–
Weaire’s law can thus be explained for large n by the cell’s tendency toward a regular shape under
the constraint that the three angles at cell junctions must sum up to 2π.

Figure S3: Comparison of analytical approximations to Aboav–Weaire’s law for regular polygons.
We now consider the asymptotic behavior in the limit of large n. Aboav’s empirical law reads
mn = an + b

(18)

with coefficients a = 5, b = 8 originally observed in polycrystals [1]. Weaire derived the coefficients
a = 5, b = 6 under a mean field approximation of polygonal regularity, which led him to suggest
that b = 6 + Var(n) [17]. Taking the limit in Eq. 13, we find a linear asymptote with

Both of these values lie remarkably well within the experimentally observed range of the coefficients for epithelial tissue (see Fig. 2c in the main article). Other values can be obtained if the
physiological range over which the average is taken is chosen differently. The dependence of a and
4

b on the integration bounds is shown in Fig. S4 along with the inverse relationship. As an example,
Aboav’s empirical values a = 5, b = 8 are obtained if θmin ≈ 50.4◦ and θmax ≈ 160.7◦ , which are
physiologically plausible values for epithelial tissue. Taking the mean epithelial coefficients a = 4.8,
b = 8 (Fig. 2c) as a reference, we find the slightly tighter bounds θmin ≈ 51.9◦ and θmax ≈ 156.0◦ .

Figure S5: Illustration of the neighbourhood of an irregular polygon. The internal angle deviates
from that of a regular polygon, θn , by the angle θi . The dashed lines mark the outline of a regular
pentagon in the centre, as well as the maximal angle θi+ < 2π
n for θi to maintain convexity. The
angles of the three polygons, θn + θi , θ1 , θ2 , must add to 2π.
Evidently, the regularity assumption on the polygonal cell shape breaks down for small n. Eq. 17
predicts higher polygon types around triangles, quadrilaterals and pentagons than can be observed
in many cellular arrangements (Fig. S3). In real epithelial tissue, cells with large area are not available discretionarily, as required for the regularity assumption to hold for small n. Additionally, side
lengths between neighbouring cells must match at shared edges, posing further limitations on the
attainable cell regularity in a contiguous lattice. Therefore, a generalisation of the above formalism
is proposed here for irregular central polygons.
We now consider a deviation θi from the internal angle of a regular polygon (Eq. 1) (Fig. S5),
and calculate the expected neighbour number of direct neighbours by averaging over a physiological
range θi ∈ [θi− , θi+ ], yielding

is its volume (in the present one-dimensional case, its length). A natural choice for the permitted
degree of irregularity appears to be to set the bounds θi− , θi+ to a certain fraction of the turning
angle of regular polygons, π − θn = 2π/n, which represents the maximum excess angle that will
maintain convexity of the polygon (Fig. S5). It is therefore reasonable to set

However, Eq. 27 is a non-elementary integral as it can be expressed in terms of dilogarithm functions
[7]. Taking also the complicated integration domain I into account, a closed-form solution appears
to be inaccessible. Nevertheless, with the assumptions used for the irregularity bounds in Eq. 26,
it is easy to recognize that the same asymptotic slope a as for the regular case is recovered, since
Eq. 27 converges to Eq. 13 as θi− , θi+ → 0, which is the case for n → ∞. The asymptotic intercept
b, on the other hand, depends on the granted range of irregularity.
In order to calculate mn for given n, we evaluate the double integral numerically using the
acceptance-rejection method with uniform sampling in the domain [θi− , θi+ ] × [θ, θ] in MATLAB
2018a. The integral offers sufficient parametric freedom to get very close to the linear Aboav–
Weaire relationship over the entire range of polygon types (Fig. S6), and it still does if θ = 0 is fixed,
such that the lower integration bound θmin is essentially governed by the symmetry requirement
of θ1 and θ2 . Furthermore, restricting the irregularity angles to symmetric domains by setting
α = β leaves us with two free parameters, θ and β. A curve fit of our model to the empirical line
mn = an+b with a = 5 and b = 8 yields least squared errors for θ = 151.3±0.7◦ and β = 0.59±0.04
2
with an adjusted coefficient of determination of R = 0.997 (Fig. S6). Taking the mean epithelial
coefficients a = 4.8, b = 8 (see Fig. 2c in the main article) as a reference, we find θ = 146.3 ± 0.5◦
2
and β = 0.52 ± 0.03 (R = 0.998), both of which are physiologically plausible values for epithelial
tissue.

In summary, the linear Aboav–Weaire law emerges naturally for geometric reasons in contiguous,
two-dimensional cellular lattices when a limitation in locally available cell areas and matching side
lengths enforce polygonal irregularity, i.e., interior angles deviating from those of regular polygons.
For high-n polygons (n > 6), it can even be explained by the cells’ tendency toward regular
polygonal shapes alone. We expect this explanation of Aboav–Weaire’s law to be applicable also
to other systems partially driven by surface minimisation and area variability, such as soap bubble
froths or polycrystals. Our theoretical results might also be appreciable in terms of contact graph
theory, of which the present polygonal space-filling packing represents a special case.

LBIBCell Simulations

Simulation framework We used the software LBIBCell [15] to simulate the detailed epithelial
tissue dynamics. LBIBCell simulates a 2D plane of the epithelial tissue, and thus allows us to
simulate the apical cell dynamics, or more precisely a plane where cells adhere laterally (Fig. 2a,
main manuscript). LBIBCell represents the extracellular and cytoplasmic spaces of the tissue as
Newtonian fluids and incorporates the fluid-structure interaction with the elastic cell boundaries
via an immersed boundary method [10]. The Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid dynamics is
solved using the Lattice Boltzmann method, i.e., the fluid and its motion are realised by particle
ensembles which stream and collide on a 2D regular lattice [2]. Cell boundaries are geometrically
highly resolved and cell boundaries and cell-cell junctions are modelled with elastic springs.
LBIBCell Simulations for Figure 2 The proliferating Drosophila larval wing disc tissue was
simulated as described in (Kokic et al, submitted); the parameter values are summarised in Table
S1. Simulations with two different cell division rules were carried out 10 times each. According to
the first cell division rule, Hertwig’s rule [5, 3, 8], cells divide perpendicular to their longest axis. In
the second set of simulations, the orientation of the cell division axis was randomised. Details on
the implementation of the cell division rules can be found in [15].
LBIBCell Simulations for Figure 3 To generate polygonal lattices of regular polygons, centres
of circular cells were placed at sites corresponding to the centres of regular polygons in different
Euclidean tilings by convex regular polygons (i.e., {6, 6, 6}, {4, 8, 8}, {4, 6, 12}, {3, 12, 12}). The
relative sizes of the cells followed the quadratic law (Eq. 3 in the main manuscript). In a second step,
the circular cells were enlarged uniformly until they collided at single points with their neighbours.
These start structures (LBIBCell input) were created using Inkscape [6], Fiji [13, 14] and R [16]. A
detailed description of the pipeline and scripts are available on https://git.bsse.ethz.ch/iber/
Publications/2019_vetter_kokic_aboav-weaire-law. In a last step, cells were grown uniformly
until the entire lattice was filled with cells and cells thus formed a contiguous lattice. In order to
prevent gaps, the cell junction search radius was increased to its maximum value (cf. Figure S3
in Kokic et al., submitted; Table 1), and the amount of mass that was added intracellularly was
subtracted from the extracellular fluid (cf. Cell Junction and Membrane Channels in Table S1).
All other LBIBCell parameter values were set to the same values as for the Drosophila larval wing
disc (Table S1), and all subsequent quantifications were carried out as described in (Kokic et al.,
submitted).
