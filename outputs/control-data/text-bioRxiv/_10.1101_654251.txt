Abstract

23
24

Introduction: Uganda is experiencing a significant increase in the prevalence of non-

25

communicable diseases including hypertension and obesity. Frequent alcohol use is also highly

26

prevalent in Uganda and is a key risk factor for both hypertension and obesity. This study

27

determines the trends of frequent alcohol consumption, hypertension and obesity across different

28

age groups, and the extent to which alcohol consumption affects the two.

29

Methods: The data were extracted from the 2014 National Non-communicable Diseases Risk

30

Factor Survey (N=3,987) conducted among adults aged 18 to 69 years. Hypertension was

31

defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140mmHG or diastolic blood pressure ≥90. Obesity was

32

defined as body mass index >30 kg/m2. Frequent alcohol consumption was defined as alcohol

33

use 3 or more times a week. Multivariable log binomial regression analysis was carried out for

34

each of the two outcome variables against age group and controlled for frequency of alcohol

35

consumption and few other independent factors. Non-parametric tests were used to compare

36

trends of prevalence ratios across age groups. Modified Poisson regression was use in few

37

instances when the model failed to converge.

38

Results: The results showed increasing trend in the prevalence of hypertension and frequent

39

alcohol consumption but a declining trend for obesity along different age groups (p<0.01).

40

Frequency of alcohol consumption did not significantly modify the age group-hypertension and

41

age group-obesity relationships although the effect was significant with ungrouped age. There

42

was significance in difference of fitted lines for hypertension prevalence ratios between frequent

43

drinkers and mild drinkers and between abstainers and frequent drinkers. Alcohol consumption

44

did not have any significant effect on obesity-age group relationship.

45

Conclusion: The results call for more research to understand the effect of alcohol on the

46

hypertension-age relationship, and the obesity-age relationship. Why prevalence ratios for

47

hypertension decline among those who take alcohol most frequently is another issue that needs

48

further research.

Introduction

56

About 13% of the world’s adult population (11% of men and 15% of women) is obese[1] while

57

32% of adults aged more than 24 years are hypertensive[2]. The prevalence of obesity and

58

obesity-related diseases including hypertension are increasing worldwide [3]. These conditions

59

lead to reduced quality of life given their protracted nature, and they also lead to premature

60

deaths, especially due to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes [4]. Once associated only with

61

high income countries, obesity and hypertension are now highly prevalent in low and middle

62

income countries, including Uganda, and are shown to be on the rise[5, 6]. The World Health

63

Organization (WHO) projects the number of hypertension cases in Sub Sahara Africa (SSA) to

64

increase substantially from an estimated 80 million in 2000 to 150 million in 2025[7].

65
66

Alcohol consumption is widely known to be associated with high blood pressure and obesity [5,

67

8-11] both of which are known to increase with age [12, 13]. However, little is known on how

68

alcohol affects high blood pressure and obesity trajectories across age. So far studies have

69

reported varying patterns of relationship between alcohol and hypertension across different age

70

groups. A study in the United States of America, found that in young people aged 18-26, blood

71

pressure reduced among those who took 2-3 drinks a day but rose higher with more or less

72

alcohol intake [14]. In Germany a study found a linear relationship between alcohol intake and

73

blood pressure for only men aged 20-34 and 50-74 and women aged above 49 years[15]. In

74

France a positive relationship between blood pressure and alcohol intake was more evident in

75

under 40 years[16]. A study in Japan found that the elevating effect of alcohol drinking on blood

76

pressure was more prominent in the elderly than in the young[17]. A study in Netherlands found

77

a stronger association between alcohol and blood pressure in older men compared with young

78

men[18]. A study in Michigan, USA found that alcohol intake patterns significantly changed the

79

relationship between age and blood pressure[19]. Such varying evidence calls for more localized

80

research that can inform local intervention. Africa has the lowest research output on most health

81

fields but more critically missing is evidence on Non-communicable diseases and their risk

82

factors in the local environment [20].

83

In 2016, 7% of women and 1% of men in age group 15-49 in Uganda were obese [21]. In 2014,

84

the National Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) Risk Factor Survey found that the prevalence

85

of hypertension was 26.4% and it was associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) > 25kg/m2 [6,

86

22]. These estimates are consistent with findings from other studies conducted in smaller

87

populations in Uganda which estimated the prevalence of hypertension to be in the range of

88

14%-35% [11]. On alcohol consumption the country is rated 5th highest consumer in Africa in

89

terms of per capita pure alcohol with an estimated average consumption of 9.8 liters (14.4 liters

90

for males and 5.2 liters for females) of pure alcohol per person per year[23].

91
92

There is a paucity of research on how alcohol affects obesity and hypertension levels across age

93

groups [24, 25] especially in developing countries yet this would inform age group specific

94

intervention. As such, the purpose of this study is to establish the trends of frequent alcohol

95

consumption, hypertension and obesity across different age groups and the extent to which the

96

frequency of alcohol consumption influences the trends of the two.

Materials and Methods

100

This paper uses secondary data from the National Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) Risk

101

Factor Survey of 2014. The survey included 3,987 participants aged 18-69 and 60% of them

102

were females. The data were collected using the STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS).

103

STEPS is a World Health Organization method that provides a standardized method for

104

collection, analysis and dissemination on risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCD)[22].

105

The survey covered the whole country and used a three stage sampling design to select

106

participants. The first stage involved sampling enumeration areas (EA), followed by random

107

selection of 14 households in each EA and lastly a random selection of one member of household

108

from a list of eligible members. The response rate from the survey was 99% and more details on

109

the methods used can be obtained from the national NCD report or papers written from the

110

mother data set [6, 22].

111
112

For purposes of this study, only relevant variables were provided by the managers of the NCD

113

survey. Key among these variables were frequency of alcohol consumption and amount drank in

114

previous 30 days, height, and weight, biometrics that include hypertension and body mass index,

115

socio-demographic-economic characteristics of the respondents.

116
117

Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90

118

mmHg [26] while obesity is defined as body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2 [27].

119

Measurements for Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were taken three times and average for

120

each was computed. In the previous study the average was computed for only last 2

121

measurements and the difference is minor. Frequent alcohol consumption was measured as

122

taking alcohol 3 or more times a week.

123
124

We used log binomial regression to model hypertension and obesity with key independent

125

variable being age group and key interaction variable as frequency of alcohol consumption.

126

Binomial models were preferred because they provide prevalence ratios directly. Secondly unlike

127

the alternative logistic regression log binomial models do not overestimate their coefficients

128

when the outcome of interest is a common occurrence[28, 29] although they also have problems

129

of lack of convergence[19] . In the few times non-convergence occurred we used modified

130

Poisson regression which solves the problem but it is not also perfect since it produces

131

inconsistent variances[19]. Stata V14 software was used for analysis.

132
133

Log binomial models are expressed as follows[29]

175

Characteristics of respondents

176

distribution did not differ by sex (Table 1). Two thirds were married or in relationship, but

177

marital status varied by sex. Two fifths had attained primary school, but among women a higher

178

proportion did not have any formal education. Nearly two thirds were employed, but among

179

men a higher percentage were employed than among women (75% vs. 58%). The median income

180

per month was 100,000(≈USD 30) and it was significantly higher among men (110,000) (USD

181

≈33) than women (60,000) (≈18).

182

The level of frequent alcohol consumption (3 or more times a week) was 8.4% but it was

183

significantly higher among men (16%) than women (3.4%). Obesity was at 7.5% and it was

184

higher among women (10.9%) than men (2.4%). Hypertension level was at 18.4% and it did not

185

significantly differ by sex.

A total of 2956(74.1%) of the respondents were in the age range 21-50 years. The age

almost at the same average gradient until 46-50 years when the prevalence of hypertension rises

197

higher. The level of obesity reduces with age group to near zero in age group 51-55 when it rises,

but at a lower gradient. Values for all the three indicators start at nearly the same level and

Fig 2 shows the ratio of prevalence of hypertension at each age group to that at base age group of

219

18-20 by frequency of alcohol consumption. It’s evident that after 40 years the hypertension

220

prevalence ratio across age groups among frequent drinkers was persistently lower than that

221

among those who did not take alcohol or drank moderately while trends for those who drank

222

moderately and those who never drank kept a steady rise at almost equal gradient. Beyond 60

223

years the ratio among the frequent drinkers dropped sharply to 0.8 rose slightly to 2.3.

A closer examination of trends of prevalence ratios across age groups by sex showed that the

229

prevalence of hypertension across age groups is relatively lower among men that don’t take

230

alcohol while it’s the opposite among women (Fig 3). A Wilcoxon’s rank sum test for the

231

difference was significant for men (p=0.03) but not for women (p>0.1). The figure left out those

232

who drank most frequently because they were too few to split by sex across age groups.

Obesity

251

Fig 5 shows the trend of prevalence of obesity across all age groups. The prevalence of obesity

252

among women starts high up from around 18% in the age group 21-25 and declines to around

253

1% at the age group of 46-50 years while that among men starts low at 3.6% and reduces to 3.1%

254

in the same period. The test for the difference in the two trends using Wilcoxon’s rank sum test

255

shows a p-value of p=0.016.

Table 3 shows prevalent ratios for obesity. The prevalence ratios of obesity reduced with

increasing age groups even after controlling for drinking patterns and marital status which were

significant in the bivariate analysis. A test of interaction with frequency of alcohol consumption

267

did not show any significance hence lack of influence on the obesity-age group relationship.

Discussion

283

This study explored relationship patterns of alcohol with hypertension and obesity across

284

different age groups. The findings show that the prevalence of frequent alcohol consumption and

285

hypertension follow a nearly similar increasing trend across all age groups below 50 years while

286

the prevalence for obesity follows a downward trend. The relationship between frequent alcohol

287

consumption and hypertension is significant and it changes significantly by age in single years

288

but not by 5 year age groups. The relationship between frequent alcohol consumption and

289

obesity is not significant and does not change across different age groups. Across all age groups

290

the prevalence of hypertension among frequent drinkers is lower than those who either don’t

291

drink or drink less. While among men it’s the non-drinkers that have low prevalence of

292

hypertension it’s the opposite among women.

293

The increasing trends of frequent alcohol consumption and hypertension across age groups are

294

consistent with several studies in different parts of the world [31] but inconsistent with studies in

295

some other communities[32]. The increasing trend for alcohol consumption can be explained by

296

increased access and ability to buy alcohol which may reduce after 50 years due to change in

297

lifestyle, working environment and social network. Another view could be threshold effect where

298

frequent alcohol consumption exacerbates physiological damages that may also lead to

299

hypertension. However, we noticed that among those who used alcohol frequently, the

300

prevalence ratios rose sharply, dropped and rose again. Future research may examine this pattern

301

more specifically and address other contextual factors not addressed in this study including

302

potential cohort effects, age since alcohol initiation and other potential factors that can impact

303

these findings.

304

The strong relationship between frequent alcohol consumption and hypertension is reported in

305

many studies [33] and some affirm a causal relationship[34]. However, the change in this

306

relationship with single years and not 5 year age groups is what needs to be investigated further.

307

The prevalence of obesity reduces with age groups but this is more evident among women where

308

it declines sharply between age groups 21-25 and 46-50. This contrasts with studies that show

309

increasing trend of obesity with age group among women in other countries [35, 36] but others

310

show decline with age[37, 38]. While some studies have found a significant positive relationship

311

between alcohol consumption and obesity[39] this study did not find such relationship

312

significant. The negative association between age and obesity can be partially explained by the

313

lower life expectancy observed in Uganda compared to populations examined elsewhere as well

314

as a potential cohort effect of the older participants in this study.

315

Lower prevalence of hypertension among frequent alcohol consumers compared to the abstainers

316

and infrequent drinkers is an issue that needs further investigation. One probable explanation is

317

the low number of respondents that were frequent alcohol consumers. In subsequent analysis by

318

sex the frequent consumers were left out because of small numbers.

319

Conclusion

320

We conclude, firstly, that the prevalence of frequent alcohol consumption increases across the

321

age groups at almost the same level with prevalence of hypertension until 50 years of age.

322

The frequency of alcohol consumption did not significantly modify the age group-hypertension

323

and obesity-age group relationships but the effect was significant with single years.

324

The prevalence of hypertension among frequent alcohol consumers is lower than that among

325

abstainers and infrequent/mild drinkers. This calls for further research as this is inconsistent with

326

several studies.

327

While among men it’s the non-drinkers that have lower prevalence of hypertension than the mild

328

drinkers across age groups it’s the opposite among women although the difference is not

329

significant as in the case with the men. More research is needed to identify causes behind this

330

difference.

331

Programs aimed at reducing hypertension should include messages on abstinence from alcohol

332

consumption especially among men. Priority should also go to older persons.

333

Frequent alcohol consumption is a key factor in the prevalence of hypertension among most age

334

groups examined, but particularly among those ages 40 and above. Frequent drinking is a

335

modifiable factor that needs to be addressed within clinical practice. Typically, while treatment

336

protocols may include counseling patients on the risk of alcohol, it is not clear whether doctors

337

or health care providers in Uganda have fully embraced or implemented alcohol reduction

338

strategies such as alcohol screening and brief interventions in their treatment of hypertension (is

339

this true). However, this modification to current clinical practice should be explored and

340

investigated further. Moreover, additional research is needed to determine the biological

341

mechanism linking alcohol use to hypertension and what factors exacerbate this association

342

among adults in their 40-50s.

343

These findings underscore the importance of examining alcohol use in the context of non-

344

communicable diseases in order to determine prevention and intervention strategies.

345

Limitations

346

Our findings should be considered in the context of several limitations. First and foremost, the

347

data are self-reported and as such, inherent biases or lack of knowledge about certain health

348

conditions may have yielded an underestimate of both obesity and hypertension. Moreover,

349

while disclosing alcohol use is not considered a sensitive matter, study participants across

350

settings often under report actual use. Most likely these limitations yield an underestimate of the

351

true association between alcohol use, hypertension and obesity than what has been reported in

352

this study. Moreover, the analyses were based on a cross sectional survey and as such we could

353

not measure the timing and prospective association of the associations between alcohol use and

354

hypertension and obesity which would be of great importance for future prospective cohort

355

studies. Finally, we included several potential confounders in our analyses. However, there may

356

be other important variables that were not considered or available for analyses.
