We propose a simple model for chromatin organization based on the interaction of the chromatin
fibres with Lamin proteins along the nuclear membrane. Lamin proteins are known to be a major
factor that influences chromatin organization, and hence gene expression in the cells. Our polymer
model explains the formation of lamin associated domains, and for heteropolymers with sequence
control, can reproduce observed length distributions of LADs. In particular, lamin mediated interaction can enhance the formation of chromosome territories as well as the organization of chromatin
into tightly packed heterochromatin and the loosely-packed gene-rich euchromatin regions.

Introduction: The link between microscopic and
macroscopic descriptions of genome structure and function is one of the key questions of present day biology [1–
3]. In particular, the structure and folding principles of
the interphase chromosomes has been the subject of much
debate over the last decade[4–6]. While the structure of
DNA double helix and histone proteins that form the nucleosome is well understood[7–9], how the nucleosomes
finally organise to form the interphase chromosomes still
remains an open question[10–12]. The organization of the
chromatin determines the function of the cell type, with
the epigenetic state of a differentiated cell correlated with
differential packaging of the chromosome. Understanding
the principle behind the chromatin organization thus has
important implications for the proper functioning of the
cell as misfolding errors leads to several human pathologies.
The advent of experimental techniques such as chromosome conformation capture (2C/3C/5C/Hi-C)[13–16]
and FISH[17, 18] has provided a wealth of information on
the large scale structure of the chromosome. A key experimental observation has been that different chromosomes
segregate into different territories with minimal contact
between them[19–21]. Additionally, the chromatin can
also be classified into transcriptionally silent heterochromatin and gene expression active euchromatin, with heterochromatin regions being more tightly packed, and located preferentially in the nuclear periphery. The euchromatin, in contrast, is relatively loosely packed and
located in the interior[22–25].
One of the key mediators in the organization of the
genome are interactions between the nuclear lamina and
chromatin. The nuclear lamina (NL) is a complex structure that acts as a scaffold for various proteins that regulate nuclear structure and function [26, 27]. Mammalian
cells contain two B-type lamins, B1 and B2, and two Atype lamins, lamins A and C. In most cells, lamins B1
and B2 are concentrated along the NL in nculear periphery, while A-type lamins are also found in the nuclear interior[28, 29]. The lamin proteins in the NL play

an important role in the organization of the chromosomes within the nucleus. Experimental studies have
shown that certain regions of the chromosomes lie in
close proximity to the lamina, and DamID experiments
have been used to build a map of chromosome lamin
interactions[26, 27, 30, 31]. These experiments reveal
that there are large domains of chromosomal regions that
have a high degree of affinity for nuclear lamins (called
lamina-associated domains or LADs), alternating with
regions of very low affinity. The LADs in the human
genome can be very large, ranging from 0.1M b − 10M b
in length[30, 31]. The LADs are associated with gene
poor regions of the chromosome, with the mean gene density being around half of that in the non-LAD regions.
Additionally, other gene activity markers, such as PolII
and the histone mark H3K4me2 are also repressed within
LADs, indicating that LADs represent a strongly repressive chromatin environment[26, 27, 30]. A large fraction
of the human chromosome (≈ 40%) consists of LADs[30].
Subsequent experiments have also shown that the interaction between LADs and lamin proteins are stochastic in nature, with only a fraction of the total LADs being
in contact with the NL in a given cell[31]. After the cell
division process, a new subset of LADs can be in contact with the NL. ChIP-DamID experiments have shown
that only those LADs which interact with the lamin proteins have enhanced levels of H3K9me2, which implies
that this methylation mark status is also stochastic, and
directly correlated with the LAD position[31]. These experiments conclusively show that LADs are positioned
stochastically within the nucleus.
While there has been considerable theoretical progress
in understanding the origins of the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes [32–37], an important missing
ingredient in the proposed models has been the effect of
the NL-chromatin interactions. In this letter we propose
a simple polymer model that incorporates confinement
as well as the attractive interactions between the chromosomes and the lamin proteins. The main results are
as follows: ( i) for a homopolymer we reproduce experi-

of base pairs and their associated contact probabilities,
( ii) for a heteropolymer with sequence control we obtain
length distributions of LADs, and ( iii) for a mixture of
homo and hetero-polymers we observe phase separation
of chromosomes and formation of distinct territories. We
thus demonstrate that a complete understanding of the
folding principles of the chromosome need to incorporate
this interaction for a cohesive picture.
Model : We model the chromatin as a self-avoiding
polymer chain of N beads, each of diameter b0 , connected
by harmonic springs. The polymer is confined within a
sphere of radius R. The polymer consists of two types of
beads, type A and type B (see Fig. 1). The inner surface
of the sphere attracts beads of type A, mimicking laminchromatin interactions. The fraction of type A beads is
denoted by f . The lamin interactions occur if a bead of
type A lies within a cut-off distance Rc = b0 from the inner wall of the sphere. The energy of the polymer chain
is thus given by the Hamiltonian,

bead-spring polymer, and is taken to be in the same
range as previous studies [32, 37], and tj denotes the
type of bead (0 for A-type beads, and 1 for B-type
beads). The lamin-chromatin binding energy is given
by EB . Equilibrium conformations of this confined polymer system in the presence of an attractive boundary is
then simulated following Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme,
and the statistical averages are calculated for a time of
TM C = 109 MC steps after allowing an equilibration time
of Teq ∼ 10N 2 ∼ 106 MC steps.
The radius R of the nucleus and the polymer volume
fraction is chosen in our model to conform to a biologically relevant scenario. Human nuclei sizes can range
between diameters of 6µm − 11µm[38, 39], while the to-

(normalised) number of monomers within a spherical shell as

tal number of base pairs in the human genome is of the
order of 6 billion (6 × 109 bp)[38]. Assuming that a 30 nm
chromatin bead has 3000bp[40, 41], the chromatin volume
fraction of the human nuclei ranges from 0.004 to about
0.25. For our simulated confined polymer with N = 512
monomers, the radius of the confining sphere then corresponds to R ≃ 12 for a volume fraction of 0.004 and
R = 7 for a volume fraction of 0.25. We look at physical
quantities of interest for these two values of the radius
R = 12 and R = 7 in this Letter.
Results: We first consider a homopolymer with all type
A beads that can bind to the lamin proteins, i.e. f = 1.
This is done for both values of the nuclear radii used in
our investigations, R = 7 and R = 12 for a range of
binding energies EB ∼ O(kB T ). As shown in Fig. 2(a),
the mean square displacement hR2 (s)i as a function of
contour length of the polymer s scales as hR2 (s)i ∼ s2ν ,
with an exponent ν between 0.4 − 0.7 for short genomic
distances and saturates for higher values. The saturation
of the mean square separation is a simple consequence
of the confinement of the polymer. For R = 12, ν ≈
0.5−0.7; while for R = 7, ν ≈ 0.4−0.6 which corresponds
extremely well with measured values from FISH data[42–
44].
We also compute the contact probability for two
monomers separated by s base pairs to approach within
a certain cutoff distance rcut of each other. Consistent
with previous studies, we choose rcut = 2.5b0 [34]. For
small base pair separations, the contact probability decreases before tapering off at large values (see Fig. 2(b)).
The contact probability decreases following a power law
of the form pc (s) = s−β1 for small values of s. The expo-

nent β1 ≈ 1.5 − 1.6 for R = 12 and ≈ 0.9 − 1.0 for R = 7,
consistent with Hi-C experiments[45, 46].
Further, we compute volume fraction of monomers as
a function of the radial distance from the centre, i.e.
we count the number of monomers nr in a thin shell
r → r + ∆r, with ∆r = 1, and compute the volume occupied by these nr monomers normalized by the volume
of the shell. This is shown in Fig. 2c. The corresponding
number of monomers (normalised by the total number
N ) in each shell is shown in Fig. 2(d). Entropic confinement, in the absence of lamin-protein interactions (i.e.
EB = 0), leads to a low volume fraction near the surface
and a constant value throughout the rest of the nucleus.
For EB ≥ 2 kB T , the chromatin volume fraction at the
nuclear periphery increases such that the outermost shell
is more densely packed than the inner ones. This is consistent with observations of tighter chromatin packing in
heterochromatin regions[22–25], and also correlates with
the hypothesis that lamin protein - chromatin interactions are more prominent in heterochromatin regions,
which explains their tighter packing, and consequently,
higher volume fractions.
Next, we investigate domain formation within our
model to compare against DamID experimental data. We
define the lamin proximity index for the ith monomer as,
ri −Rc
, which deterLP I = (R−(Rc +0.5b0 ))Θ(r
i −Rc )+Rc Θ(Rc −ri )

mines the position of the centre of a monomer, with respect to the distance Rc beyond which it interacts with
the lamin. The LP I value ranges from [−1 : 1], with positive values indicating bond-formation with the lamin.
Figures 3(a,b) and (d,e) show the variation of LP I as
a function of the binding energy EB for both spheres of
radii R = 12 and R = 7 respectively.
The lamin-associated chromatin domains for the homopolymer, has a size distribution P (ℓ) ∼ exp[−ℓ/ℓ0 ],
peaked around ℓ = 0, with the characteristic length scale
ℓ0 monotonically increasing as a function of the binding energy EB (Fig. 3(c,f)). The size-distribution obtained from DamID data is peaked around a non-zero
value of ℓ [30]. This arises due to the fact that for chromatin roughly 40% of the monomers can associate with
the lamin. This necessitates a heteropolymer model of
chromatin where only a fraction f of the beads (type A)
can associate with the lamin proteins.
Heteropolymer: A heteropolymer model for chromatin
assumes NA beads of type A and NB beads of type B,
such that NA /(NA + NB ) = f . We consider three heteropolymer models: (i) random-heteropolymer - where
the NA number of A types beads are chosen randomly;
(ii) uniform-block-copolymer - where the NA beads are
divided into uniform patches of size p = N/4; and (iii)
gaussian-block-copolymer - where the NA beads are divided into patches with patch sizes are chosen from a
Gaussian distribution (µ = 20, σ = 5). For polymers
with quenched randomness of the type studied here, the
fraction f as well as the disorder-correlation length plays
a role in dictating their equilibrium properties. We investigate the statistical properties of the confined polymer
both as a function of the lamin binding energy as well
the fraction f of binding monomers.
The mean square displacement between any two
monomers hR2 (s)i has the same statistical features as
a homopolymer, with hR2 (s)i ∼ sν for small separations
followed by a saturation at larger values. The exponent
ν increases as a function of EB for all fractions considered, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Increasing the binding
energy EB allows the monomers to spread out on the
surface, as lamin attachments become more favourable,
leading to an increase in the exponent ν. As expected,
ν also increases with increasing the fraction f of binding
monomers. A similar behaviour is observed for the contact probability exponent β (Fig. 4b). The values of the
exponents ν and β are similar for the different disorder
realisations studied.
We also plot the volume fraction (Fig. 4c) as a function of the normalised distance from the center of the
sphere, for a binding fraction of f = 0.4 corresponding
to the biologically relevant situation. For small binding
energies, the volume fraction drops close to the surface of
the nucleus. With increasing binding energy the volume
fraction shows a maxima near the lamina, indicating an
increased density of monomers there.

FIG. 5. Lamin proximity index for EB = 3kB T for a sphere with R = 7 for the three heteropolymer models: (a) random

are in proximity to the NL, while green lines indicate bond-forming type-A monomers. The corresponding distributions of
domain sizes is shown for R = 7 in panels (b, e and h), and for R = 12 in panels (c, f and i).

We now turn to the lamin contact maps in order to investigate domain formation for the heteropolymer case.
A representative plot for the Lamin Proximity Index

in Fig. 5(a) for R = 7 and EB = 3kB T . Domains of
lamin-associated-chromatin alternate with ones that do

not come in contact with the NL. The length distribution
of the domains P (ℓ) for R = 7 and R = 12 are shown in
Figures 5(b) and 5(c) respectively. The domain sizes are
distributed exponentially for both values of the nuclear
size indicating that a random heteropolymer model does
not reproduce the characteristic distributions of LADs

observed in experiments [30]. Fig. 5d) shows the LP I for
the uniform block copolymer with f = 0.5 having 4 equal
length alternating blocks of attractive and inert domains
that interact with the lamin. The block copolymeric nature is reflected in the LPI plots (Fig. 5d) with larger
domain sizes in comparison to those formed in the case
of the random heteropolymer. The associated domain
length distributions for R = 7 and R = 12 are shown in
Figs. 5 (e) and (f) respectively. In contrast to the single
exponential fit for both the homopolymer and the random heteropolymer, the domain size distribution in this
case is a double exponential, with an enhanced probability for larger domains. For high enough binding energies,
additionally there is a peak corresponding to the domain
size as well. Finally we consider the case of Gaussian
block heteropolymer with f = 0.4, with the corresponding LPI shown in Fig. 5(g). The distributions of the LAD
sizes reflect the Gaussian nature of the block copolymer
for higher values of the binding energy EB & 2kB T , as
can be seen from Figs. 5(h) and (i) for both values of the
radius. This qualitatively agrees with the domain size
distribution observed in DamID measurements[30]. The
heteropolymer model thus illustrates that the observed
domain length distributions in experimental studies must
necessarily correlate with the distribution of chromatin
regions that can interact with lamin proteins as well as
setting a scale for the strength of the lamin-chromatin
interactions. Weak interactions give rise to exponential
domain length distributions, and hence the interaction
energies must be beyond a certain strength in order to
explain the experimental observations.
Multiple polymers: We explore the formation of chromatin territories within our model. In the absence of any
lamin interactions (EB = 0), the lamin contact maps
(Fig. 6a) shows negligible territory formation. A sample equilibrium configuration, shown in Fig. 6(c) illustrates that there is significant interpenetration between
the four polymer strands. If we allow two of the four
polymers to interact with the lamin, these two polymers
show extremely low levels of interpenetration. This can
be seen from the contact map shown in Fig. 6(b), where
the first polymer (monomers 0 − 127), and the third
polymer, (monomers 256 − 383) interacts with the lamin
(EB 6= 0), while the other two do not. The regions of
the contact map corresponding to overlaps between the
first and third polymers clearly show a reduced intensity, indicating the two polymers seldom approach each
other. This is also clear in the sample equilibrium configuration shown in Fig. 6(d), where the first (brown)
and third (red) polymers stay close to the attractive surface on the two distal sides of the sphere. The two noninteracting polymers (shown here in cyan and blue) on
the other hand, occupy the central region of the sphere
and have increased inter-penetration. The interactions
of the lamin proteins with the chromatin thus enhances
the ability of the chromatin to segregate into individual

territories. The attractive surface interaction makes it
energetically favourable for the chromatin polymers to
occupy different regions of the nucleus, leading to the
formation of territories. This provides a candidate mechanism by which chromosome territories form within the
eukaryotic cell nucleus.
Discussion: In conclusion, we model chromatin packing in the cell nucleus as a polymer confined in a spherical cavity having an attractive interaction with the inner walls. We compute statistically measurable quantities such as mean square displacement as a function of
base pair separation hR2 (s)i, the lamin proximity index
LP I, and contact map for homo and heteropolymers with
different disorder realisations and different nuclear radii.
Our computational results explain the data observed in
DamID and FISH experiments.
A complete map of chromatin-nuclear lamina interactions generated by DamID experiments have identified a large number of LADs in the human chromosome,
and understanding the origin of the observed distribution of LADs is thus important to understand the 3D
organization of the genome. Our work shows that a heteropolymeric chromatin, with domains of lamin-binding
regions with sizes drawn from a distribution, reflects this
structural heterogeneity. We show, for example, that for
Gaussian distributed domains, the lengths of lamin associated regions also follow a Gaussian distribution. Further, for low binding energies, the distribution of lengths
follows a single exponential. Thus our analysis shows
that lamin chromatin interactions need to be beyond a
certain critical strength (few kB T s), such that thermal

to dynamic chromosomes, and also reflect the underlying
domain structure.
For the case of multiple polymers, while it is known
that confinement can introduce territory formation [47],
we show that lamin mediated interactions can effectively
strengthen the formation of chromosome territories, even
at densities where territory formation would not be expected from simple confinement.
While our model shows several interesting features a
quantitative understanding of genome organization is far
from complete. We assumed an uniformly attractive surface, corresponding to a uniform distribution of lamin
proteins. In reality, there is a complex and heterogeneous distribution of lamin filaments on the nuclear envelope, and this would lead to tighter heterochromatin
packaging at regions of high lamin concentration [48].
Further, A-type lamins are known to be present on the
nucleolas as well[28, 29]. Thus LADs on chromatin can
interact with the nucleolas surface in the interior of the
nucleus. The effect of this attractive surface in the nuclear interior can compete with the attractive interaction at the nuclear periphery to give rise to non-trivial
structures. The current model focuses solely on the effect of nuclear lamin interactions. However, it is known
that various other proteins such CTCF[49, 50], cohesins
and condensins[51–53] play a role in the large-scale organization of the genome. An open question is how
protein-mediated interactions in the bulk compete with
lamin-interactions on the surface to determine 3D organization. Non-equilibrium active forces may also play a
role, although their role in large scale organization remains open. While preparing this manuscript for publication we became aware of a similar model by Chiang
et al.[54]. While our model does not include sequence
specific data as an input into hetero/euchromatin track
lengths, it is more generic, allowing for systematically
tuning the disorder correlation length of heterochromatin
tracks along the backbone. Despite its conceptual simplicity, our model captures features of conformational
statistics of the chromatin. This calls for a systematic
study of specific interactions among beads and lamin to
understand robustness of genetic landscape on changes
in mesoscale parameters.
We hope that our simple theoretical model will encourage experimental work in this direction. Our study predicts that tuning the strength of lamin-chromatin interactions can change the distributions of lamin-associated
domain lengths. If the interactions can be made sufficiently weak, the theory predicts a transition to a single
exponential distribution of domain sizes. Further, tuning
the interaction strength will also change the radial volume fraction, with volume fraction at the nuclear periphery increasing monotonically with increasing interaction
strength. These specific predictions can be tested against
experimental data.
Our study emphasizes how sequence heterogeneity in

the genome affects the three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, this heterogeneity is crucial to
a complete understanding of the chromosome packaging
problem.
