Abstract

Identified as an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) susceptibility gene by genome wide-association
studies, BIN1 has 10 isoforms that are expressed in the Central Nervous System (CNS). The
distribution of these isoforms in different cell types, as well as their role in AD pathology still
remains unclear. Utilizing antibodies targeting specific BIN1 epitopes in human postmortem tissue and analyzing RNA expression data from purified microglia, we identified three
isoforms expressed specifically in neurons (isoforms 1, 2 and 3) and four isoforms expressed in
microglia (isoforms 6, 9, 10 and 12). The abundance of selected peptides, which correspond to
groups of BIN1 protein isoforms, was measured in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and their relation
to neuropathological features of AD was assessed. Peptides contained in exon 7 of BIN1’s N-BAR
domain were found to be significantly associated with AD-related traits and, particularly, tau
pathology. Since only isoforms 1, 2 and 3 contain exon 7, it appears that decreased protein
expression of the N-BAR domain of BIN1 is associated with greater accumulation of tau pathology
and subsequent cognitive decline, with astrocytic rather than neuronal BIN1 being the more likely
culprit. These effects are independent of the BIN1 AD risk variant, suggesting that targeting
specific BIN1 isoforms might be a novel therapeutic approach to prevent the accumulation of tau
pathology.

Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of aging-related dementia and is
characterized by cognitive decline associated with hyperphosphorylation of tau protein,
accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. In the last few
years, several susceptibility loci that contribute to genetic risk for AD, including one that contains
the BIN1 (Bridging integrator 1) gene, have been identified by genome wide association studies
(GWAS). The effect size of the BIN1 variant (tagged by rs6733839) is among the largest for
common AD variants; only APOEe4 and TREM2 1 2 have larger effects. BIN1, a member of the
BIN1/amphiphysin/ RVS167 family, is highly expressed in the brain and in skeletal muscle 3. It
has been implicated in diverse cellular processes such as endocytosis, actin dynamics, DNA repair,
membrane trafficking, inflammation and apoptosis 4. The BIN1 gene has 20 exons which encode
several known structures including an N-BAR domain, a phosphoinositide (PI) binding motif, a
CLAP (clathrin and AP2) binding domain, a Myc-binding domain (MBD) and a Src homology 3
(SH3) domain (Fig. 1a). The N-BAR domain, encoded by exons 1 to 10, is involved in membrane
curvature 5. The phosphoinositide (PI) binding motif is encoded by exon 11 and is only present in
a few BIN1 isoforms (isoform 4, 8 and 12). The CLAP domain is encoded by exons 13 to 16 and
is involved in endocytosis 6. Its inclusion in mature protein is highly variable among isoforms.
Finally, the MBD domain, encoded by exons 17 and 18, plays a role in the regulation of c-Myc, a
transcription factor regulating histone acetylation 7. BIN1 is expressed in 14 RNA transcripts,
generated by alternative splicing, and 11 of them are translated into respective protein: isoforms 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 (Fig. 1b). Isoforms 1 through 7 are brain specific with isoform 1
being exclusively expressed in neurons 3. Isoform 8 is specifically expressed in muscle 3. Isoforms

9 and 10 are ubiquitously expressed and are also detected in the brain 8. In the brain, it was reported
that BIN1 isoforms are translated into protein in different cell types: neurons mostly express
isoform 1, 3, 5 and 7 while astrocytes express isoforms 2, 5, 9 and 10 8.
Genetic analysis of BIN1 has shown that the rs59335482 insertion allele is associated with
an increase of BIN1 mRNA expression in the brain 2, and this manuscript also reports an increase
of BIN1 mRNA expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of AD patients compared to nonAD patients 2. These findings highlight that a polymorphism associated with an increase of BIN1
expression in the CNS is not associated with AD risk: the functional consequences of the risk allele
remains unclear. A different study found altered methylation in the BIN1 locus at cg22883290 in
relation to neuritic amyloid plaques and a pathologic diagnosis of AD, and this altered methylation
pattern was independent of the effect of the rs744373 susceptibility variant 9. Thus, there appears
to be a convergence of a genetic factor and an environmental or experiential factor mediated by
epigenomic changes on risk of AD in the BIN1 locus. Further, mechanistic dissection has shown
that BIN1 interacts with tau

4

and is involved in tau-mediated neurotoxicity in a Drosophila

melanogaster 2.
In addition to BIN1, GWAS have also identified over 30 other loci implicated in AD10, and
approximately one-third of them are expressed in microglia and other myeloid cells

,

emphasizing the potential role of immune cells as contributors to the onset of AD. BIN1 has been
implicated in inflammation; for example, there is a report of an increase of inflammation in BIN1
knock-out mice 13, 14. However, the role of BIN1 in microglia needs to be clarified as at least some
of its isoforms are expressed in all CNS types. In addition, an association between expression of
some RNA isoforms and AD was reported: a decrease of isoform 1 and an increase of isoform 9
expression was noted in small collections of human AD post-mortem brain samples 15, 16. De Rossi

and colleagues reported that the decrease of isoform 1 (the largest isoform) expression is correlated
with a decrease of a neuronal marker, illustrating the loss of neurons observed in AD. On the other
hand, the level of isoform 9 seems to be correlated with the abundance of astrocyte (GFAP) and
microglia (CD45) markers 17. These findings suggest that there may be an increase of isoform 9
expression by reactive astrocytes and microglia during AD. Indeed, BIN1 RNA isoform 9 is highly
expressed by glial cells 18, 19; however, no study has shown the expression of BIN1 in microglia in
post-mortem human tissue. Furthermore, the extent of the characterization of the expression of
these different isoforms in different cell types had been limited by the small number of
commercially available antibodies against exon-selective epitopes of BIN1. Here, using antibodies
recognizing specific epitopes of BIN1 and a targeted proteomic approach, we studied the
distribution of different translated BIN1 exons and hence protein isoforms in different cell types
in the human brain as well as their relation to pathologic measures of AD.

Material and Methods

BIN1 isoform cloning
pLVX Ires-Neo lentiviral plasmid from Clontech was cut with EcoRI/MluI to remove the IRESneo cassette. eGFP-P2A linker expression cassette with a new multiple cloning site was
synthesized as linear dsDNA (gBLOCK (IDT)) and cloned into the cut vector using NEB Builder
DNA assembly master mix (New England Biolabs). All BIN1 isoforms were then synthesized as
gBLOCKs (IDT) and cloned into the GFP-P2A lentiviral vector using NEBuilder DNA assembly
master mix according to the manufacturer protocol.

HEK293T cells plated in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 12ug of lentiviral vector expressing
various BIN1 isoforms using 36ul Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). After 48 hours, cells
were harvested, and protein lysates were prepared from 1x106 293T cells by adding 100ul of Lysis
Buffer (NaCl 140mM, HEPES 10mM pH7.4, NP-40 1%) plus PMSF 1mM, DTT 1mM, Complete
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). After 1h incubation on ice, lysates were cleared by spinning
at 13,000rpm, 10 min, 4°C. Protein concentrations had been determined by BCA protein assay
(Biorad). A total of 20μg of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis using
NuPAGE 7% Tris-Acetate Gel (Thermo-Fisher), then transferred to a Nitrocellulose membrane.
After 1h blocking in 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were
then incubated overnight at 4°C with in house generated primary antibodies against various
epitopes of BIN1 at final concentration of 2ug/ml or anti-BIN1 Ab 1:500 (99D and H100, Santa
Cruz), respectively. The membranes were washed in TBST (4×10 min) before 1h incubation with
an anti-rabbit HRP 1:5000 (Santa Cruz). The immunoblots were then visualized using the ECL
(Amersham).
Cell culture and TMA preparation
Preparation of cultured cells for paraffin embedding: a batch of 108 293Expi cells had been
transfected with each of the lentiviral vector expressing various BIN1 isoform according to
manufacturer’s instruction (Thermo-Fisher). After 48h in culture, cells had been harvested,
centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4°C for 5 minutes, washed in PBS twice. Once PBS had been removed,
10% Neutral Buffered Formalin had been added down the side of the tube onto the cell pellet
(Thermo-Fisher). Formalin-Fixed cell pellet had been Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE), sectioned and
included Tissue microarray (TMA) blocks in triplicate, ~ 2.25 mm core diameter. After a 24 h
fixation period, cells were processed and embedded into paraffin. A tissue microarray (TMA) was

constructed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell pellet preparations. Triplicate 2.25 mm
cores from each of the cell pellet blocks were punched and placed into the TMA block.
Untransfected 293 cell pellet preparatiom was also included in triplicate. A non-related tissue
sample was included in the TMA as an orientation marker.
Validation of isoform-specific anti-BIN1 antibodies
Five-micron thick sections of TMA block containing 11 cell pellets were prepared and placed on
charged slides. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using Ventana Discovery Ultra
automated staining platform (Roche Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Briefly, paraffin
sections deparaffinized and rehydrated. Epitope retrieval was performed in Ventana CC1 (EDTA,
pH 8.0) buffer at 95 °C for 64 min. Slides were reacted against anti-BIN1 antibodies at one
concentration (final concentration of 0.25- 1 µg/mL, as selected from immunohistochemistry
method optimization studies). Following primary antibody incubation, sections were incubated
with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibodies (OmniMap HRP kit, Roche Ventana) followed by
detection with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstaining with hematoxylin. Stained slides
were digitized, and staining was evaluated visually. Photomicrographs were captured at 100x
magnification using ImageScope software (Leica Microsystems). A non-related tissue sample was
included as an orientation marker.
ROSMAP cohort
The Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Memory and Aging Project (MAP) are both cohort studies
directed by Dr. David Bennett at RUSH University. Non-demented individuals over age 65 are
recruited and consent to brain donation at the time of death. Both cohorts implement the same
annual evaluations including 19 cognitive functional tests and use accepted and validated
procedures to diagnose AD and other dementias and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Since 1994

(ROS) and 1997 (MAP), more than 3,069 individuals have been enrolled and 1641 are still alive
and the follow-up rate exceeds 95% and the autopsy rate exceeds 90%. All participants undergo a
uniform structured evaluation for AD including CERAD, Braak Stage, NIA-Reagan, and a global
measure of AD pathologic burden with modified Bielschowsky; amyloid load and PHFtau tangles
by immunocytochemistry and image analysis and stereology; Lewy bodies and TDP-43 by
immunocytochemistry, and the age, location, and size of all macro- and microscopic infarcts. Both
frozen and fixed brain tissue is available on request from these subjects. Our laboratory has
generated DNA methylation scans, H3K9Ac ChipSeq, and RNAseq data (n=508) from the frozen
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as part of other studies (Suppl. Table 1). We also have RNA-seq data
from FACS-purified viable microglia from some of these individuals at autopsy (n=21).
Immunohistochemistry on human post-mortem brain tissue
Formalin-fixed post-mortem brain tissues were obtained from brains donated to Rush University
Medical Center. All participants consented to brain donation at the time of death.
Six μm sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from the cortex frontal (n=3) were
used to stain NeuN (Millipore), IBA1 (Wako), ALDH1L1(eBioscience), CD45 (Novus Biological),
along with anti-BIN1 antibodies provided by Biogen.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using citrate for antigen retrieval. The sections are blocked
with blocking medium (8% of horse serum and 3% of BSA) and incubated overnight at 4°C with
primary antibodies. Sections are washed with PBS and incubated with fluorochrome conjugated
secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) and coverslipped with anti-fading reagent with Dapi
(P36931, Life technology). Photomicrographs are captured at X20 magnification using Zeiss Axio
Observer.Z1 fluorescence microscope and exported to Image J imaging software (NIH, Maryland,
USA). The images have been quantified using CellProfiler and CellProfiler Analyst.

Isolation of human monocytes and MDMi cell differentiation
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were extracted from blood samples from the
PhenoGenetic cohort using a standard Ficoll protocol (Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS). PBMCs were
frozen at a concentration of 1-3x107 cells/mL in 10%DMSO + 90%FBS and stored in -80oC until
they are processed. CD14+ monocytes are purified from frozen PBMC samples using a positive
isolation strategy (CD14+ selection kit, Miltenyi). 100,000 monocytes were allocated per well in
96-well plates. To differentiate to MDMi, monocytes were cultured in RPMI-1640 media
supplemented with 10ng/ml M-CSF, GM-CSF and NGF-β, as well as 100ng/ml CCL2 and IL-34
for 10 days.
Expression Analysis by Real-Time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, Germany), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The expression of genes of interest were measured by qRT-PCR, in
duplicate. B2M was used as an internal control. 5μL of the cDNA was amplified using 10μL of
TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix, 1.5 of primers and 4μL of RNase free water. qRT-PCR was
run on Quantstudio 3 detection system (Applied Biosystems, USA).
Isolation of adult human microglia, RNA-sequencing and data processing
Microglia were isolated from autopsy brain material as described in Olah et al., Nature
Communication, 2018. Briefly, upon arrival of the autopsy brain sample, the cerebral cortex and
the underlying white matter were dissected under a stereomicroscope. All procedures were
performed on ice. Only microglia isolated from the grey matter of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC) were used in this study (n=21). The dissected tissue was first mechanically dissociated.
Subsequently, myelin was depleted by the use of anti-myelin magnetic beads, following which the
cell suspension was enriched in microglia with anti-CD11b magnetic beads. Microglia were then

sorted based on their characteristic CD11b and CD45 expression and a viability dye (7AAD) on a
BD FACS Aria II sorter. Cells were sorted into a 96-well PCR plate containing lysis buffer.
Following FACS the lysate was snap frozen on dry ice and stored at -80°C until further processing.
Library construction was performed using the SmartSeq-2 protocol described in detail elsewhere
(Olah et al.). Samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform with a read length of
100bp and paired end reads. RNA-Seq reads in FASTQ format were inspected using FASTQC
program. Barcode and adapter contamination, low quality regions (10bp at beginning of each fastq
reads) were trimmed using FASTX-toolkit. The STAR (v2.5.3a) aligner software was used to map
paired-end reads to the reference genome (assembly GRCh38) using Ensembl gene annotation
(release 91). Transcription levels were estimated using the RSEM (v1.2.31) software and reported
in Transcripts Per Million (TPM). Four out of 25 samples were removed because of low percentage
of exonic and UTR reads (< 30%) or low total number of reads mapping to the transcriptome (<
106 reads).
SRM proteomics
Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) proteomics was performed using frozen tissue from
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (Suppl. Table 1) (n=1377). The sample preparation for
LC-SRM analysis follows standard protocol, as described elsewhere 20, 21. An average ~20 mg of
brain tissue from each subject was homogenized in denaturation buffer (8M urea, 50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA). Following denaturation, 400 ug protein aliquots were
taken for further alkylation with iodoacetamide and digestion with trypsin. The digests were
cleaned using solid phase extraction, following readjustment of tryptic peptide digests
concentration to 1 ug/uL. 30 uL aliquots were mixed with 30 uL synthetic peptide mix. All liquid
handling steps were performed in 96-well plate format using Epmotion 5075 TMX (Eppendorf)

and Liquidator96 (Rainin). We selected 7 proteotypic peptides based on BIN1 isoform-specificity
and peptide detectability prediction tool CONSeQuence 22 (Suppl. Table 2). The 7 synthetic heavy
peptides labeled with

13

C/15N on C-terminal lysine and arginine were purchased from New

England Peptide (Gardner, MA) with cysteine modification with carbamidomethylation. All LCSRM experiments were performed on a nano ACQUITY UPLC coupled to TSQ Vantage MS
instrument, with 2 µL of sample injection for each measurement. A 0.1% FA in water and 0.1%
in 90% ACN were used as buffer A and B, respectively. Peptide separations were performed by
an ACQUITY UPLC BEH 1.7 µm C18 column (75 µm i.d. × 25 cm) at a flow rate 350 nL/min
using gradient of 0.5% of buffer B in 0-14.5 min, 0.5-15% B in 14.5-15.0 min, 15-40% B in 1530 min and 45-90% B in 30-32 min. The heated capillary temperature and spray voltage was set
at 350 °C and 2.4 kV, respectively. Both the Q1 and Q3 were set as 0.7 FWHM. The scan width
of 0.002 m/z and a dwell time of 10 ms were used. All the SRM data were analyzed by Skyline
software

23

. All the data were manually inspected to ensure correct peak assignment and peak

boundaries. The peak area ratios of endogenous light peptides and their heavy isotope-labeled
internal standards (i.e., L/H peak area ratios) were then automatically calculated by the Skyline
software and the best transition without matrix interference was used for accurate quantification.
The peptide relative abundances were log2 transformed and centered at the median.

Results
Study of the distribution of BIN1 isoforms in the CNS using transcriptomic and proteomic
approaches
We first evaluated the distribution of BIN1 isoforms in the CNS by analyzing RNA
expression of each isoform in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (Fig. 1c); the figure

also provides the reference numbers for each BIN1 isoform and an outline of the locus. Isoforms
1 and 9 are most highly expressed, followed by isoforms 6, 7 and 10. Isoforms 2, 3, 5, and 12 are
expressed at low levels, and isoform 8, which has been reported to be specific to muscle 3, is absent.
To characterize the cell-specific expression of BIN1’s different isoforms at the protein
level in human post mortem tissue, 4 antibodies against 4 specific exons (exon 7, 11, 13 and 16)
have been generated. The targeted exons are present in different domains of BIN1: exon 7 is
present in the N-BAR domain; exon 11 is in the PI domain; while exons 13 and 16 are in the CLAP
domain (Suppl. Fig. 1a). These exons are alternatively spliced in selected isoforms (Fig. 1b). To
validate the various BIN1 antibodies, we cloned BIN1’s 11 protein-coding isoforms and expressed
them in HEK293T cells. As positive controls, we used commercially available anti-BIN1
antibodies: clone 99D (recognizing a mid-portion of BIN1 present in isoforms 1 through 9) and
clone H100 (recognizing the C-terminus of BIN1 present in isoforms 1 through 12). No basal
expression of BIN1 was detected in the HEK293T cell clone that we used to express the different
isoforms (data not shown). As expected, the 4 custom antibodies against different epitopes of BIN1
recognized the selected isoform, according to the scheme depicted in Fig 1b (Suppl. Fig.1b).
Furthermore, the 4 custom antibodies against different epitopes of BIN1 recognized the selected
isoform expressed in 293T cells by immunohistochemistry (Suppl. Fig. 2). Specific reactivity was
demonstrated against the appropriate transfected cell pellet controls, while no non-specific
reactivity was observed (Suppl. Fig. 2). Having validated these new reagents, we deployed them
to stain human post-mortem brain samples to characterize the distribution of the different isoforms
of BIN1 by immunofluorescence.

BIN1 isoforms are expressed in neurons and astrocytes

Immunostaining using the antibody recognizing exon 7 showed a co-localization with
NeuN, a neuronal marker and with ALDH1L1, an astrocyte marker (Fig. 2a). This observation
suggests that exon 7 of BIN1 is expressed in both neurons and astrocytes. The same approach was
used for the antibodies recognizing exons 11, 13 and 16 in order to define the cell types expressing
these exons. Exons 11, 13 and 16 are expressed in both neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 2b, 2c, 2d);
however, only a subset of astrocytes expressed exon 16 of BIN1 (Fig. 2d, arrows), suggesting a
more context-specific role for this isoform. Considering that exon 7 is only present in BIN1
isoforms 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 1b), the results indicate that these three isoforms might be expressed in
neurons and astrocytes. BIN1 isoforms 4 and/or 12, which both contain exon 11 (Fig. 1b), are
expressed in neurons and astrocytes. Similarly, isoforms 4, 5 and 6 that contain exon 13 and
isoform 7 which contains exon 16 (Fig. 1b) appear to be expressed in both cell types. Since isoform
8 is not expressed in the CNS (Fig. 1c), we excluded it from this annotation relating to neurons
and astrocytes.
BIN1 isoforms 6, 9, 10 and 12 are expressed in human microglia
Two previous publications have tried to characterize the presence of BIN1 in post-mortem
human brain samples, but neither had shown expression in microglia 17, 18. In order to investigate
whether BIN1 is expressed in microglia, we performed a BIN1 mRNA isoform expression analysis
in transcriptomes of 21 subjects with live grey matter microglia purified from fresh autopsy 11 (Fig.
3a). Using estimates of isoform abundance derived from our paired-end reads of 100 bp, we
observed expression of isoforms 6, 9, 10 and 12 in these purified cortical microglia, with RNA
isoform 9 being the most highly expressed isoform in both batches of samples. Estimates of
isoform expression level from these RNA sequencing data are supported by the results of an

alternative approach which counts the number of reads mapped to each exon (Suppl. Fig. 3a).
Overall, these results support the presence of BIN1 RNA in purified human microglia, and shotgun
proteomic data generated from purified microglia derived from other human samples by the same
pipeline confirmed the detection of BIN1 at the protein level. As seen in Suppl. Table 3, 6 BIN1
peptides encoded by different exons were present in these data.
In order to explore the expression of BIN1 by microglia in human post mortem brain tissue,
an antibody recognizing an epitope of BIN1 contained within isoforms 1-9 (Ab BIN1 99D) was
used in combination with the microglial marker IBA1 (Fig. 3b). The results showed expression of
BIN1 in the nucleus of IBA1 positive cells, suggesting the presence of BIN1 isoforms 1-9 in
microglia. In order to narrow down the identity of the isoforms that are specifically expressed by
microglia at the protein level, the exon specific antibodies of BIN1 were again utilized. The BIN1
antibody recognizing exon 11, contained in isoforms 4, 8 and 12 (Fig. 3c), produced a positive
staining in the nucleus of IBA1 positive cells, confirming the expression of isoform 12 which was
also observed at the mRNA level. Isoforms 4 and 8 also contain exon 11, but they can be excluded
since we didn’t detect these isoforms at the RNA level in purified microglia (Fig. 3a). Subsequently,
we tested a BIN1 antibody against exon 7 (which is present in isoforms 1, 2 and 3) but observed
no co-localization between BIN1 and IBA1 (Fig. 3d), suggesting that BIN1 isoforms 1, 2 and 3
are not expressed by microglia. These results confirm our mRNA expression analysis of microglia
where none of these isoforms were detected (Fig. 3a) and are consistent with previously published
reports of isoform 1 and 3 expression in neurons and isoform 2 in astrocytes 8. Finally, we tested
an antibody against exon 13 (present in isoforms 4, 5 and 6). As observed in Fig. 3e, we detected
positive staining in the nucleus of a few IBA1 positive cells, suggesting that only a subset of
microglia express BIN1 containing exon 13. These results confirm our RNA expression analysis

of microglia, where isoform 6 but not isoforms 4 and 5 was detected. In summary, using antibodies
against selected BIN1 epitopes, we find that BIN1 isoforms 6, and potentially 9 and 12 are
expressed by microglia in the aged human brain.
To explore whether these isoforms are expressed in all myeloid cells (including microglia and
monocytes) or more specific to myeloid cells of the CNS, we evaluated data from human purified
monocytes and matched Monocyte Derived Microglia-like (MDMi) cells (Fig. 3f). We note a
significant increase of BIN1 isoforms expressed in microglia as isoforms 10 and 12 (p<0.0001) in
MDMi compared to their corresponding monocytes. These findings showed that isoforms present
in myeloid cells are expressed in a context-dependent manner and are probably more prominent in
microglia than in peripheral myeloid cells. Fig. 3g presents a summary of these results.
We evaluated the possible role of genetic variants on BIN1 expression; in particular, we
evaluated the BIN1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported to be associated
with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). However, these variants had no effect on gene or isoform mRNA
expression in a well-powered sample of cortical tissue data

24

(n=503) or in a small sample of

purified microglia (n=20) (Suppl. Fig. 3b and 3c). Other non-AD SNPs in the BIN1 locus were
seen to have a modest effect on expression in cortical tissue data for isoform 10, which is expressed
in microglia (Suppl. Tables 4a and 4b), but this was not seen in the small dataset derived from
purified microglia.

Association between BIN1 isoforms and AD-related traits
Using RNA sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 541
participants in two prospective studies of aging (ROSMAP subjects), we assessed the relation of
BIN1 isoforms to AD-related traits (Suppl. Fig. 4). We find no significant association between

BIN1 isoforms with a syndromic diagnosis of AD dementia and AD-related traits such as a
person’s slope of cognitive decline prior to death or quantitative measures of neuritic amyloid
plaques, neurofibrillary tangles or PHF tau (which measures the presence of an AD-associated
phosphorylated epitope) burden.
Given potential differences between RNA and protein expression, we then turned to a
quantitative proteomic approach: we used signal reaction monitoring in DLPFC samples of a larger
set of ROSMAP participants (n=1377) to measure the abundance of 7 peptides that originate from
different domains of the BIN1 protein (Fig. 4 and Suppl. Tables. 2-3). Five of the peptides map to
the N-BAR domain: two in exon 7, one spanning exon 7 and 8 and one each in exons 8 and 10.
The other two peptides map to a linker domain (encoded by exon 12) and exon 13 which contains
the proximal element of the CLAP domain.
After testing 7 peptides (Suppl. Fig 5), only the three peptides which contain sequence
from exon 7 display associations with AD related-traits: a diagnosis of AD dementia, the
participants’ trajectory of cognitive decline, residual cognition and quantitative measures of both
amyloid and Tau pathology (tangles) (Fig. 4a-f and Suppl. Table 5). In secondary analyses, we
also evaluated other neuropathologic traits that are available in these subjects and find no
association with neurovascular measures, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, hippocampal sclerosis,
Lewy Bodies, or the burden of TDP43 pathology (Suppl. Table 6). These findings suggest a
specific association between exon 7 of BIN1 and AD-related pathologies, and our measures of
amyloid and tau pathology appear to be more strongly associated than the measures related to
clinical function. Overall, as pathology accumulates, exon 7 peptide expression is reduced.
Similarly, the expression of these peptides is diminished as cognitive functions worsens. To
address the possibility that these associations are due to a shift in cortical cell populations, we

repeated these analyses in a subset of individual in which we could estimate the proportion of
different cell types using RNA sequence data (n=508). As seen in Supplementary Table 7, the
results of these analyses remain significant for AD pathologies after including a correction for the
different cell types.
Since the burden of amyloid and tangles are partially correlated to one another, we used
conditional analyses to assess whether BIN1 exon 7 peptides are primarily driven by one of the
two pathologies or are independently associated to both measures (Suppl. Table 8). When we
adjust for the burden of tangles, most of the association with amyloid is no longer significant, aside
for the peptide that bridges exons 7 and 8, which is diminished by 49.2% (Fig. 4g). On the other
hand, the associations with tangles are diminished but remain significant when we account for the
effect of amyloid, suggesting that the association of the alternatively spliced exon 7 of BIN1 with
AD is primarily driven by tangles, with a possible minor component involving amyloid
independent of tau (Fig. 4g).
Since the primary effect of BIN1 exon 7 on pathology is exerted through tangles, we further
explored whether this relation with tangles explained the association of BIN1 with cognitive
decline; in evaluating different models using mediation analyses, we find that the peptide
LQAHLVAQTNLLR explains 1.48% of the variance in cognitive decline (p=4.63.10-5), when
modeled independently: with higher protein expression of this peptide we see slower cognitive
decline. On the other hand, tangles explain 20% of the variance in cognitive decline (p=7.59.1067

), where higher tangles increase the rate of cognitive decline. When modeled jointly, the effect

of the peptide LQAHLVAQTNLLR on cognitive decline is reduced significantly (r2 from 1.48%
to 0.49%), whereas the effect of tangles on cognitive decline is unchanged (r2 from 20% to 19.7%),
suggesting that the majority of the role of BIN1 in cognitive decline is not independent of Tau

(Suppl. Table 9). In other words, we propose that reduced inclusion of exon 7 into BIN1 proteins
contributes to increases in tangle burden (Fig. 4h) which then causes more rapid cognitive declines.
Fig. 4i presents a summary of these results.

Effect of genetic variants and known risk-associated molecular features on peptide measures
We evaluated the role of APOEe4 which has a strong role in AD, with both tangles and
cognitive decline: specifically, APOEe4 explains approximately 7.7% of the variance in tangles
while the BIN1 peptide LQAHLVAQTNLLR explains up to 2.8% of the variance in tangles. In
an independent model containing the peptide, LQAHLVAQTNLLR peptide explains 1.48% of the
variance in cognitive decline, while APOEe4 explains 5.7%. However, in a conditional model
containing both LQAHLVAQTNLLR peptide and APOEe4, the LQAHLVAQTNLLR peptide
explains 0.76% of the variance in cognitive decline (Fig. 5b), whereas, APOEe4 explains 6% of
the variance in cognitive decline. This indicates that the association of LQAHLVAQTNLLR
peptide with cognitive decline persists after adjustment with APOEe4 (p=0.00386) but is not
entirely independent.
Secondarily, we evaluated whether the other known AD susceptibility variants influence
BIN1 peptides, but we found no evidence of association between AD variants and BIN1 peptides
after correcting for the testing of multiple hypotheses (Suppl. Table 10). Further, we performed a
cis-pepQTL (+- 1Mb) (peptide QTL) analysis of the BIN1 locus but found minimal effects of
genetic variation in the vicinity of BIN1 on peptide expression. We found a single linkage
disequilibrium (LD) block where the top SNP rs74490912 is associated with expression of BIN1
peptide LQAHLVAQTNLLR (p=4.9.10-6); but this SNP is in only weak LD with the BIN1 AD
SNP rs6733839 (R2=0.156).

In other analyses, we have found Tau pathology to be associated with certain miRNA
(miR132 and mir129) (https://doi.org/10.1101/234351) as well as certain modules of co-expressed
genes derived from cortical RNA sequence data 24.We therefore extended our analyses to include
these variables and find that the association of the BIN1 peptide LQAHLVAQTNLLR with tangles
is independent of all of these factors (Suppl. Table 11). Finally, we have recently reported largescale changes in the neuronal epigenome in relation to Tau pathology 25, and we have developed a
person-specific score for the extent of cortical epigenomic alteration. Using this score, we found
that there is no association between tau-related epigenomic alterations, as defined by the H3K9Ac
histone marks, and the LQAHLVAQTNLLR or other BIN1 peptides (Suppl. Table 12). Thus, the
relation of BIN1 protein expression to the accumulation of Tau pathology appears to be
independent of these factors.

Validating the association of Exon 7 with AD in human post-mortem tissue
Given the association of exon 7 with AD and AD-related pathologies in the proteomic analyses,
we stained AD and cognitively non-impaired subjects with the antibody recognizing BIN1 exon 7
and ALDH1L1, a marker of cortical astrocytes, or NeuN, a neuronal marker to resolve which cell
type may be driving the association. We collected images in a systematic manner and used Cell
Profiler to automatically segment these images and count the number of cells expressing each
marker combination. We then compared the frequency of cells expressing each marker
combination in the AD and cognitively non-impaired subjects (Supplementary Figure 6). While
the number of BIN1 exon 7+ neurons shows no difference, we find a significant decrease in the
number of astrocytes expressing BIN1 exon 7 in AD compared to cognitively non-impaired
subjects while there is not a significant difference in the total number of astrocytes between the

two classes of subjects. This suggests that the role of BIN1 exon 7 in AD is related to its role in
astrocytes and perhaps that loss of a class of BIN1 exon 7+ astrocytes contributes to the
accumulation of Tau pathology.

Discussion
Since its identification as a genetic risk factor for AD in 2010, several studies have focused on
characterizing the mechanism by which BIN1 contributes to the onset of AD

2, 15, 26

. Currently,

only 2 of the 11 translated isoforms have been described as being differentially expressed in the
AD brain: a decrease of isoform 1 and an increase of isoform 9 expression correlate with AD 15.
However, it remains unclear (1) whether these transcriptional changes are due to differences in
cell type proportions and (2) in which cell type(s) BIN1 may play a role in influencing AD risk
since it is widely expressed.
In this study, we identified the cell types expressing different BIN1 RNA and protein isoforms
and investigated their association with AD neuropathology. At the RNA level, we detected
expression of isoforms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 12 in the human DLPFC, and we observed that
isoforms 1 and 9 are highly expressed compared to the other isoforms. Utilizing antibodies
specifically targeting exon 7 on post-mortem human brain, we deduced that isoforms 1, 2 and 3
are expressed in both neurons and astrocytes. Exon 7 encodes the N-BAR domain of BIN1 and is
specific to isoforms 1, 2 and 3 5, 27; Exon 7 enables the interaction between BIN1 and dynamin 2
(DNM2), a ubiquitously expressed GTP binding protein, and this interaction facilitates endocytic
uptake 28. Absence of exon 7 leads to the inhibition of uptake, suggesting that the BIN1 N-BAR
domain plays a key role in endocytosis via its interaction with DNM2 28. In addition, a decrease of
DNM2 mRNA in AD temporal cortex has been reported 29. In our study, we have shown that the

expression level of exon 7 peptides (AAPQWCQGK, LQAHLVAQTNLLR, NQAEEELIK) are
associated with tau pathology and cognitive decline. In addition, we report that exon 7 peptides of
BIN1 are negatively correlated with tangles, suggesting that decreased expression of
neuronal/astrocyte isoforms 1, 2, and 3 contributes to greater accumulation of tangles and cognitive
decline. Since we found no association between BIN1 isoforms and AD traits at the RNA level, it
appears that the alteration in BIN1 protein isoforms may be occurring post-translationally.
Interestingly, BIN1 has been reported to regulate endocytosis in neurons, and the loss of its
function appears to promote the propagation of tau pathology in an in vitro model, supporting our
findings 30. However, our in situ validation revealed dysregulation of expression of BIN1 exon 7
in astrocytes in AD subjects suggesting that the lack of expression of these specific BIN1 isoforms
in astrocytes might be involved in AD pathology.
In summary, based on our data and evidence from the literature, we propose that decreased
expression of isoforms 1, 2, and 3 yields increases in the endocytosis process and promotes the
formation the phosphorylation of AD-related epitopes in neurons, either in a cell autonomous or
non-cell autonomous fashion. The potential function of these isoforms expressed in astrocytes
should be investigated further. This model implicates BIN1 in the narrative of altered endocytosis
that is suggested by several of the known AD susceptibility loci. However, the BIN1 AD variant
itself does not appear to function through these alterations in the splicing of the N-BAR domain:
the rs6733839 variant’s mechanism remains unclear and independent of the role of the N-BAR
domain in AD.
Given our results, BIN1’s expression in microglia may be unrelated to the convergence of
other AD risk factors in microglia, although we need larger microglial-specific datasets to fully
explore the function of microglial BIN1 in AD. Nonetheless, we have enriched our understanding

of BIN1 in this study: our multidisciplinary approach identified 4 specific BIN1 protein isoforms
(isoforms 6, 9, 10 and 12) expressed by these cells. Except for isoform 6, these isoforms are
characterized by the lack of a CLAP domain, and they appear to be expressed at higher level in
microglia-like cells than in peripheral myeloid cells. The CLAP domain has been described to be
involved in clathrin mediated endocytosis and in the recruitment of dynamin. The absence of exon
7 and the CLAP domain in BIN1 isoforms expressed by microglia suggest that BIN1 may have a
function during aging and AD that is unrelated to clathrin mediated endocytosis. BIN1 has been
implicated in phagocytosis in macrophages 13, and an increase of incidence of inflammation has
been reported in BIN1 knock out mice

14

, suggesting a possible anti-inflammatory function of

BIN1. In addition, we show that BIN1 isoforms 10 and 12 are expressed in monocyte-derived
microglia-like cells and not in peripheral monocytes, highlighting the existence of context-specific
expression of BIN1 protein isoforms by microglia.
Overall, using multiple approaches, our study has refined the cell-type specific expression
patterns of the different BIN1 isoforms at the protein level. Our findings showed a strong
association between BIN1 isoforms expressed by neurons/astrocytes and tangles that contributes
to cognitive decline in AD, and our in situ studies refined these association to prioritize astrocytes
as the target cell type. While these isoforms may be unrelated to the effect of the rs6733839 AD
risk variant, they nonetheless represent a distinct contribution of this complex protein to AD,
offering new insights into how BIN1 could be targeted or could serve as an outcome measure in
AD studies.
