ABSTRACT

44

In land plants, the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins form a large family

45

accounting for post-transcriptional process in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

46

Although studies showed a number of PPR proteins generally influence the editing of

47

organellar genes acting as a member of editing complex, few of them were

48

characterized detailed in rice. Here, we reported a PLS-E subclass PPR protein in rice,

49

PPR756, loss function of which lead to the abolishment of RNA editing events among

50

three sites in mitochondrial genes including atp6 (ATP synthase F0 subunit 6), ccmC

51

(cytochrome c biogenesis C) and nad7 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 7). The

52

defective C- to-U transformation of atp6-368, ccmC-236 and nad7-83 resulted in the

53

retention of proline, proline and serine codon respectively to the right leucine in rice.

54

Furthermore, PPR756 could bind to the three target genes directly and interacted with

55

three OsMORFs (multiple organellar RNA editing factors), OsMORF1, OsMORF8-1

56

and OsMORF8-2. The knock-out plants of PPR756 exhibited retarded growth and

57

greener leaves during the early stages, accompanied with sterile pollens at

58

reproductive stage. These results established a role for PPR756 in the RNA editing of

59

three various transcripts, cooperating with MORFs via editosome manner in rice.

INTRODUCTION

64

The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins constitute an interesting protein family

65

widely spread in eukaryotes, from algae to human, although their number vary

66

considerably in different organisms (Lurin et al., 2004). This protein family has been

67

suggested to undergo great expansion when the terrestrial plants came into being,

68

whose numbers ranged from ~100 (in Physcomitrella patens) to about over 1000 (in

69

Selaginella moellendorffii) (O'Toole et al., 2008; Fujii and Small, 2011). However,

70

except for the landplants, other eukaryotic species contain a few PPR members such

71

as the animals, with 7 in human and 6 in mouse (Lightowlers and

72

Chrzanowska-Lightowlers, 2008, 2013). Generally, PPR proteins constitute a kind of

73

protein family which is generally characterized by 2 to about 30 degenerate tandem

74

repeats about 35 amino acids (Lurin et al., 2004). Interestingly, there are three

75

different types of PPR motifs, including P motif (35 amino acids), L motif (35 or 36

76

amino acids) and S motif (31 amino acids), according to which, the PPR proteins can

77

be divided into two main classes: P-class and PLS-class. On account of the high

78

sequence conservation of the C-terminal in different PPR proteins, the PLS-class

79

proteins are then divided into three subclasses named PLS-E, E+ and DYW

80

subclasses respectively (Small and Peeters, 2000; Lurin et al., 2004).

81

The mitochondria and chloroplasts in plants are semi-autonomous organelles, in

82

which more than 2000 and 3000 proteins are respectively estimated, but only

83

approximately 40 and 100 genes encoded by themselves, massive proteins are

84

encoded by nuclei and imported into these organelles to play important roles in the

85

regulation (Mullet, 1988; Sato et al., 1999; Millar et al., 2005). Accumulating

86

researches established PPR proteins are almost exclusively targeted to the

87

mitochondria or chloroplasts, where they take part in post-transcriptional processing

88

of RNA by altering RNA sequence, stability, cleavage, splicing or translation to

89

regulate the organellar gene expression (Dahan and Mireau, 2013; Shikanai and Fujii,

90

2013).

91

Different types of PPR proteins have been indicated to perform distinct functions,

92

such as most P-class PPR proteins always take part in the progress of organelle

93

transcripts cleavage, stability and translation, while the majority of PLS-class PPR

94

proteins act as editing factors in the post-transcriptional process (Okuda et al., 2007;

95

Saha et al., 2007). For example, PPR10 (Pfalz et al., 2009; Prikryl et al., 2011), ATP4

96

(Zoschke et al., 2012), CRP1 (Barkan et al., 1994), PGR3 (Yamazaki et al., 2004)

97

could both stabilize the organelle gene transcripts and active their translation.

98

Although almost all of the target transcripts are chloroplast ORFs, few is known to

99

affect the mitochondria gene translation just except for that MPPR6 could influence

100

the choice of start codon and the processing or stabilization of rps5 5â€™ terminal

101

(Manavski et al., 2012).

102

It has come to be known that some PPR-type Rf genes always belong to P-class

103

and influence the cleavage of sterility-associated mitochondria RNAs (Dahan and

104

Mireau, 2013). For instance, in rice ,RF1a and RF5 participated in the cleavage of

105

toxic chimeric mitochondria transcripts contributing to fertility restoration (Wang et

106

al., 2006; Hu et al., 2012). Not only the P-class PPR proteins take part in the splicing

107

of Group II introns (such as THA8) but also several PLS-class proteins could (such as

108

PpPPR43) (Ichinose et al., 2012; Khrouchtchova et al., 2012). However, when they

109

were mentioned as editing factors, the PLS-class proteins may act as the main forces

110

(Kotera et al., 2005). Up to now, a series of PLS-class proteins have been reported to

111

play important roles in the editing of mitochondria or chloroplast genes. In rice,

112

OsOGR1, OsSMK1, OsMPR25 have been indicated to participate in the editing of

113

organelle transcripts (Kim et al., 2009; Toda et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014). Previously,

114

we also reported that OsPGL1 and OsPPS1 are responsible for the RNA editing of

115

ndhD, ccmFc and nad3, respectively (Xiao et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2018).

116

In this study, we characterized a novel PPR gene, PPR756 (Os12g19260),

117

encoding a PLS-E PPR protein, which is associated with the development of rice.

118

PPR756 acted as an editing factor required for the editing of mitochondria genes, atp6,

119

ccmC and nad7, loss function of which could influence the activities of mitochondrial

120

electron transport chain complexes and result in the dysfunctional pollens.

123

PPR756 is essential for rice development

124

In previous reports, to identify the function of PPRs in rice, we generated a series of

125

RNAi transgenic lines of several PPR genes under the background of ZhongHua11

126

(ZH11, Oryza sativa.L.japanica), and characterized OsPGL1 and OsPPS1 (Xiao et al.,

127

2018; Xiao et al., 2018). In this study, we investigated a novel independent RNAi

128

lines, in which the expression of Os12g19260 was knocked down solidly

129

(Supplemental Fig. S1C). Since, Os12g19260 encodes a PPR protein with 756 amino

130

acids, we named it as PPR756 in this study. These lines displayed pleotropic

131

phenotypes compared with WT, including delayed development, more green leaves,

132

smaller leaf angle in early vegetative stage (Supplemental Fig. S1A to E).

133

According to these interesting phenotypes, we next applied the CRISPR-Cas9

134

system to create the knock-out (KO) mutant lines under the background of

135

ZhongHua11 to confirm the function of PPR756. We selected three independent

136

mutant lines for further detection in which two lines showed a premature translation

137

termination, named ppr756-1 and ppr756-2 respectively (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, in

138

order to explore the function of PPR756 in detail, we also generated the

139

over-expression (OE) transgenic lines, in which the CDS of PPR756 was driven by

140

the ubiquitin promoter and fused with the tags of Flag and cMyc (Supplemental Fig.

141

S2A). We checked the expression of PPR756 in three independent OE lines, named

142

PPR756-OE-1 to PPR756-OE-3. Results showed the relative expression of PPR756

143

was elevated in all OE lines, especially in PPR756-OE-2 (Supplemental Fig. S2B).

144

Moreover, the protein accumulation was conducted simultaneously. The signal of

145

western blotting confirmed that PPR756 were successfully expressed in transgenic

146

line (Supplemental Fig. S2C). Based on above detection and confirmation, we

147

selected PPR756-OE-2 and ppr756-1for further analysis in this study.

148

Since the leaf colour was obvious a visible phenotypic differentiation, we first

149

measured the chlorophyll contents among these lines. Data showed chlorophyll a

150

(Chla), and chlorophyll b (Chlb) were highly accumulated in KO mutants while

151

reduced in OE lines compared with WT, which well explained the change of leaf

152

colour (Fig. 1B and C). Loss function of PPR756 also resulted in erect leaves, and

153

lower seed-setting, while the OE line presented opposite phenotypes especially with

154

larger panicle compared with WT (Fig. 1D and E) All of these results indicated that

155

PPR756 played important roles in rice development and affected the yield in rice.

156

157

PPR756 especially influences pollen fertility

158

To make it clear whether the lower seed setting resulted from the male sterility or

159

female sterility, we first tested the pollen fertility by I2-KI staining. Results showed

160

that the pollens became sterile when PPR756 was null (Fig. 2A). To explore the

161

underlying mechanism, we further detected the morphological details of anther and

162

pollen by SEM. The observations of anther showed the curly anther base in the KO

163

mutant line compared with the WT and OE line (Fig. 2B). The observation of pollen

164

further revealed that most of the pollen grains in the KO mutant were distorted and

165

shrunken, while those in the WT and OE lines were spherical and regular (Fig. 2C and

166

D). All of these data indicated that the dysfunction development of pollen in KO

167

mutant accounted for the reduced seed-setting rate, implied PPR756 is required for

168

pollen development in rice.

169

170

PPR756 encodes a PPR-E subclass protein

171

Mostly, PPR proteins translated without introns (O'Toole et al., 2008), while PPR756

172

consisted of four exons and three introns based on the sequence analysis and database

173

(Fig. 1A). PPR756 was predicted with 18 putative PPR motifs by the Pfam database

174

(http://pfam.xfam.org.). In addition to the 18 PPR motifs (15 S motifs, 1 P motif and 2

175

L motifs), its C-terminal region (from 621 to 694 residues) also exhibited a strong

176

similarity to the consensus sequence of E domain which attributed to classify this

177

protein into the PLS-E subfamily (Fig. 3A). More interesting, most PPR proteins

178

consisted of P, L, S motifs in turns, however, PPR756 consisted of numbers of S

179

motifs (Fig. 3B).

180

To further explore the evolution of PPR756 in plants, a phylogenetic tree was

181

constructed based on the protein sequence alignment from 22 other species, which

182

exhibited over 55% similarity, including Aegilops tauschii, Triticum turgidum,

183

Brachypodium distachyon, Panicum hallii, Dichanthelium oligosanthes, Setaria italic,

188

Results showed all of these homologous were vascular plants with most being

189

monocots and only one dicot (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the homologous in top five species

190

were further analyzed, results showing the extremely conservation in these monocots

191

(Fig. 3D). Therefore, data suggested PPR756 may play a conservative role in different

192

plant species, and might be more especially in monocots.

193

194

Subcellular localization of PPR756

195

The majority of PPR proteins are predicted to localize either in mitochondria or

196

chloroplasts (Lurin et al., 2004). Up to now, the characterized PPR protein also

197

confirmed this view, and some of them were dual-localized to mitochondria and

198

chloroplasts. Bioinformatic analysis of the PPR756 protein sequence using the

199

TargetP 1.1 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/serivices/TargetP/) indicated that PPR756 is

200

dual-localized to chloroplast and mitochondria. To determine the actual subcellular

201

localization of PPR756 in vivo, we applied the p35S:PPR756-sGFP construct

202

encompassing the full-length cDNA of PPR756 lacking the stop codon fused with the

203

GFP (green fluorescent protein) driven by the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. Then

204

the recombinant vector and the empty p35S:sGFP vector (control) were transiently

205

expressed in the rice protoplasts, respectively. The GFP fluorescent signals were

206

detected by confocal microscopy, showing that the GFP signals were well overlapped

207

with the indicator signal of mitochondria (Fig. 4A).

208

Moreover, the Flag tag was used as a marker in the OE transgenic lines to

209

observe the subcellular location of PPR756. Immunoblot assay with an anti-Flag

210

antibody was then performed to detect the PPR756-Flag fusion protein in the

211

chloroplasts and mitochondria extracted from the OE lines. An obvious signal

212

detected in the mitochondria extractive confirmed that PPR756 was indeed targeted to

213

mitochondria, while no signal was observed in the chloroplast (Fig. 4B). Therefore,

214

these results demonstrated PPR756 was a mitochondria-localized protein.

215

216

Expression pattern of PPR756

217

To investigate the expression pattern of PPR756, a bioinformatic data was first

218

conducted using the RiceXPro (http://ricexpro.dna.affrc.fo.jp), results indicated that

219

PPR756 was constitutively expressed in all the rice tissues during the whole

220

development process, but a higher level in the reproductive stage (Supplemental Fig.

221

S3). To confirm the expression profile, we carried out the quantitative real-time PCR

222

(qRT-PCR). Results demonstrated that PPR756 was expressed in all the tissues,

223

including seedling, root, stem, leaf, young panicle, and mature spikelet. The relative

224

expression of PPR756 was much higher in mature panicle and seedling, implied it

225

played essential roles in these tissues (Fig. 4C).

226

To characterize the expression pattern of PPR756 at tissue level, we also

227

generated the transgenic plants that harbor the pPPR756:GUS under the background

228

of ZhongHua11. Different tissues of the transgenic plants were isolated for GUS

229

histochemical staining. The staining results displayed PPR756 was preferentially

230

expressed in shoot, seedling, stem and anther (Fig. 4D), which was consistent with the

231

results of RT-PCR above. These findings demonstrated the significant function of

232

PPR756 in seedling which affected the chlorophyll contents in leaves and its

233

indispensable roles in the reproductive organs which leaded to the sterile pollen.

234

235

PPR756 affects multiple C-to-U RNA editing in mitochondria

236

The PLS-PPR proteins have been reported to typically function as site-specificity

237

factors in RNA editing (Barkan and Small, 2014). According to the sub-localization

238

results of PPR756, we checked all well-known RNA editing sites, 21 in the

239

chloroplasts and 491 in the mitochondria, respectively, (Corneille et al., 2000; Notsu

240

et al., 2002) via RT-PCR and direct sequencing. In the chloroplast, results showed no

241

obviously RNA editing efficiency difference between the KO mutant and WT were

242

observed, which also implied PPR765 did not function in chloroplast directly.

243

However, in the mitochondria, the RNA editing efficiency of three editing sites,

244

atp6-368, ccmC-236, nad7-83, were significantly reduced in the KO mutant (Fig. 5A).

245

All of these three genes were involved in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC)

246

complexes. The editing defect caused by disabled PPR756 protein leaded to the amino

247

acids transformation failure: CCA(Pro)-to-CTA(Leu), CCA(Pro)-to-CTA(Leu),

248

TCA(Ser)-to-TTA(Leu) in atp6, ccmC, nad7 compared with the WT. The amino acids

249

transformation failure generally influenced the function of the proteins as subunits of

250

the corresponding complexes.

251

To investigate whether the transcript levels were affected by the editing

252

deficiency, we took advantage of the qRT-PCR to detect the relative expression levels

253

of these targets of PPR756. And the results demonstrated that there was almost no

254

influence in the transcriptional expression of the three targets (Fig. 5B). Taken

255

together, data suggested PPR756 is responsible for the three RNA editing sites in

256

mitochondria.

257

258

PPR756 protein can directly bind to its targets both in vitro and in vivo

259

As previous studies reported, PPR protein could bind specifically to the surrounding

260

RNA sequences of the editing sites as a trans-factor (Barkan et al., 2012; Nakamura et

261

al., 2012). A series of experiments have also shown that the cis-element as a binding

262

upholder were about 25 nucleotides of the upstream and 10 nucleotides of the

263

downstream sequence surrounding the target editing sites (Okuda et al., 2006). To

264

confirm PPR756 actually bind to its target transcripts, we generated a recombinant

265

PPR756 proteins. We failed to express the complete PPR756 with 18 motifs for a long

266

period. Then we removed the signal peptide and first S2 motif (residues 1-40) for

267

expression, named MBP-PPR75641-756-HIS protein which contains the MBP tag in its

268

N-terminus, and 6 x HIS tag in the C-terminus (Supplemental Fig. S4A).

Recombinant tag protein containing the two tags (MBP-HIS) only was taken as a

270

negative control. The two recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli

271

and purified. The purified recombinant proteins were tested by western blot using

272

His-tag antibody (Supplemental Fig. S4B). The binding cis-element sequences of

273

PPR756â€™s three targets were chosen by the -25 to +8 nucleotides surrounding the

274

editing site according to the previous research, and labelled with fluorescent FAM. As

275

a control, probe C (nad5-1580) was synthesized in our previous study and it has been

276

reported as the target of MPR25, another PPR protein in rice. To carry out the RNA

277

electrophoresis mobility shift assays (REMSA), the purified recombinant proteins

278

were dialyzed to remove the RNase contamination, and incubated with the

279

FAM-labelled RNA probes respectively. The binding efficiency could be detected by

280

the shift difference between the protein-RNA complexes and the free RNA probes.

281

The retarded bands were observed when the targets were incubated with

282

MBP-PPR75641-756 -HIS protein, while the Tag proteins could not bind to the RNA

283

probes (Fig. 6A). Moreover, no electrophoresis shift was observed when the probe C

284

was incubated with MBP-PPR75641-756-HIS protein as a negative control, which

285

suggested that PPR756 bound to its target RNAs specifically. We then performed the

286

competitor assays using the corresponding unlabelled RNA probes respectively to

287

further confirm the preference of PPR756 to its targets. The binding capacity to the

288

labelled probes gradually decreased following the increased competitor concentration,

289

suggested PPR756 bona fide bound to these targets directly (Fig. 6B). To validate the

290

binding activity in vivo, we next conducted RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) in the

291

OE transgenic plants to check the transcripts incorporated to PPR756. In this

292

procedure, we used the Flag antibody to obtain the RNAs bound to PPR756, and the

293

extracted RNA were converted to cDNA by reverse-transcription (Fig. 6C). Several

294

negative controls were designed, and the western blot was conducted to verify the RIP

295

efficiency. Results showed the antibody anti-Flag could specifically capture

296

PPR756-Flag and the outputs was appropriate for further analysis (Fig. 6D).

297

Subsequently, we applied qRT-PCR by relevant primers to make sure the proportion

298

of these three target transcripts. The results showed that atp6, ccmC and nad7

299

transcripts displayed different binding efficiency to PPR756 nevertheless the negative

300

control GAPDH did not (Fig. 6E). The percentage ratios of these three targets are

301

6.014, 0.210, 0.090, suggested that PPR756 preferentially bound to atp6 compared

302

with other two targets (Fig. 6F). It implied PPR756 might bind to these via different

303

manner. Taken together, our results showed PPR756 could bind to the mitochondrial

304

transcripts atp6, ccmC and nad7 directly and specifically both in vitro and in vivo.

Dysfunction of PPR756 affects the activity of mitochondrial electron transport

Transcripts of atp6 and nad7 encode the subunit of respiratory complex V and I,

309

respectively, and ccmC is involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c, which transfers

311

atp6, ccmC and nad7 in theses complexes, we attempted to detect the activities of

312

complexes of ETC in the WT, OE and KO mutant lines. The in-solution determination

313

results showed that in the KO mutant, the activity of complex I, III, IV and V were all

314

reduced significantly compared with the WT (Fig. 7A to D). The data from OE

315

transgenic lines showed the activity of complex I, III, IV and V were all increased,

316

which is consistent with the expected. Therefore, we speculated that these translated

317

proteins without proper editing on RNA level might reduce their biological functions

318

to varying degrees. Meanwhile, several representative antibodies for ETC complexes

319

were next employed. The results suggested that except for the slight reduction of

320

cytochrome c (Cyt C), the others such as NAD3, COXII and ATP6 all showed

321

significant decrease in KO mutant compared with those in WT (Fig. 7E). It suggested

322

that the decreased protein accumulation of these proteins in ETC complexes resulted

323

in the reduction of the activities. The slight effect on Cyt C might resulted from the

324

defective editing site was far away from its functional WWD domain (Ahuja and

325

Thony-Meyer, 2003). Meanwhile, the coomassie brilliant blue staining of Blue-Native

326

(BN) PAGE gel also showed all mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes

327

were decreased in the KO mutant compared with the WT and OE line (Fig. 7F). All

328

these data indicated that dysfunction of PPR756 leaded to the abortive editing and

329

then induced the decrease of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes

activities.

333

Previous studies reported that some PPR proteins function with MORFs as an

334

editosome (Bentolila et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2016). Here, to make it clear whether

335

PPR756 cooperated with MORFs, we investigated the interactions in vitro and in vivo.

336

All of seven MORFs in rice database were cloned previously, including one

337

MORF1-like (Os11g11020), two MORF2-like (Os04g51280, Os06g02600), one

338

MORF3-like (Os03g38490), one MORF9-like (Os08g04450), and two MORF8-like

339

(Os09g04670, Os09g33480). Yeast two-hybrid system was first used to check the

340

interactions. Interactions between PPR756 and OsMORF1/8s were detected, while no

341

interaction between PPR756 and OsMORF2/3/9 was observed, indicated that PPR756

342

interacted with OsMORF1/8s, but not with OsMORF2/3/9 (Fig. 8A). Studies showed

343

OsMORF8s were dual-localized in the mitochondria and chloroplast, OsMORF1 and

344

OsMORF3 were sublocalized in the mitochondria only. Therefore, the bimolecular

345

fluorescence complementation (BiFC) was conducted to detect the interactions

346

between PPR756 and all mitochondria-located OsMORFs in vivo. Yellow

347

fluorescence signals were clearly observed when the PPR756 and MORF1 or

348

MORF8s fusions were coexpressed in rice protoplast, whereas no fluorescence was

349

detected in PPR756 and OsMORF3, as well as the negative control, indicating the

350

special and physical interactions between them in vivo (Fig. 8B). Taken together, we

351

demonstrated that PPR756 directly interacted with OsMORF1/8s in mitochondria,

352

consistent with fact that the editing events of mitochondrial genes were affected rather

353

than the chloroplast genes.

DISCUSSION

356

PPR756 is required for plant development

357

In plants, RNA editing is a familiar event occurred in organelle transcripts which is

358

critical for gene repair and essential for the development of plants (Takenaka et al.,

359

2013). There are several types of RNA editing in plants including C-to-U, U-to-C and

360

A-to-I. The three editing events have different occurrences: C-to-U editing in mRNAs

361

and tRNAs, A-to-I editing in tRNAs and U-to-C editing in mRNAs of a few

362

non-flowering land plants (Chateigner-Boutin and Small, 2010). Previous study of the

363

rice transcriptome revealed 21 and 491 C-to-U editing sites in the chloroplasts and

364

mitochondria, respectively (Corneille et al., 2000; Notsu et al., 2002). Despite of the

365

mechanism and evolutional significance of RNA editing is still obscure, several RNA

366

editing factors have been characterized, such as PPRs, MORFs (also known as RIPs,

367

RNA editing factor interacting protein), ORRM (organelle RNA recognition

368

motif-containing), PPO1 (protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase 1) and OZ1 (organelle zinc

369

finger 1) (Sun et al., 2016).

370

Up to now, approximately 65 nuclear encoded genes were characterized for RNA

371

editing in mitochondrion and/or chloroplast in Arabidopsis, rice, maize and

372

Physcomitrella patens, and so on. Only 5 of them, OGR1, OsSMK1, MPR25,

373

OsPGL1 and OsPPS1 were identified in rice (Kim et al., 2009; Toda et al., 2012; Li et

374

al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2018). Here, we characterized a novel PPR

375

gene, PPR756, which is involved in the RNA editing of atp6-368, ccmC-236 and

376

nad7-83. NAD7 is the subunit of respiratory complex I and ATP6 is the subunit of

377

respiratory complex V. Therefore, the activities of complex I and V are expected

378

reduced, which may then influence the activities of complex III and complex IV. All

379

of them are involved in the energy production, consequently, like most PPR mutants,

380

loss of function of PPR756 leaded to the defects of plant pleiotropic phenotypes.

381

Furthermore, in this study, we showed that PPR756 expressed in most tissues, but

382

highly in seedling and anther, exhibiting a significant spatial expression pattern. The

383

pollen was sterile and seed setting was extremely lower than WT, which was

384

consistent with the high expression of PPR756 in anther. We speculated that the

385

energy for seedling and anther is in great demand, any short of which could lead to

386

the defects of the development in corresponding stage.

387

The majority of RNA editing events result in the conversion from proline/serine

388

to leucine (Kim et al., 2009; Toda et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014).

389

Besides of our previous studies on OsPGL1 and OsPPS1, findings of these editing

390

sites of PPR756 also established that all of them contribute to convert the

391

proline/serine to leucine, implied the function of leucine in proteins could be

392

evolutionally conserved in plants.

393

394

PPR756 shares the PPR-RNA recognition model

395

A commonly held view is that PPR proteins can directly bind to target RNA with its

396

specific manner, which is confirmed by bioinformatic and structural analysis (Barkan
19

397

et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2013). These analyses indicated that three positions of amino

398

acids distributed in two adjacent PPR repeats were of great importance in recognizing

399

its target RNA base (Takenaka et al., 2013). Position 6 in first helix motif is predicted

400

more important for distinguishing between purines (A and G) and pyrimidines (U and

401

C) while position 1 in the second helix motif directly recognizes amino (A and C) or

402

keto (G and U) groups (Yagi et al., 2013). Position 3 is less important, but provides an

403

additional constraint to binding nucleotides (Takenaka et al., 2013).

404

Most PPR proteins consisted of P, L, S motifs in turns, and usually end with a L2

405

linked to S2 motif ahead of the E domain (Takenaka et al., 2013). However, in this

406

study, PPR756 was distinctive, including numbers of continuous S motifs in which

407

several S2 motifs in the middle rather than the end. To evaluate the PPR-RNA

408

recognition model, we analysed the associations between PPR756 and its three target

409

genes on the basis of the reported general recognition mechanism. We found that the

410

match index between PPR756 and its targets atp6, ccmC and nad7 were 9/17, 11/17

411

and 12/17, respectively (Fig. 8C), such relative high match scores suggesting that

412

PPR756 could bind its target genes directly in accordance with the PPR-RNA

413

recognition model. More interesting founding in the match alignments, the highly

414

matching score from the last 8 nucleotides (-5~-12) implied that the latter might be

415

more important than the former during the recognition.

416

One of the most essential issue is the deaminase activities during RNA editing

417

events. Taking the fact that DYW motif was dispensable for RNA editing activity in

418

vivo of CRR22 and CRR28, and some DYW motif of PLS-class members possess the

419

RNA endonuclease activities in vitro (Okuda et al., 2009). Furthermore, given that

420

PPR756 belongs to PLS-E group without DYW motif, we can speculate that other

421

unknown factors deaminase activity is needed.

422

423

A coordination between mitochondrion and chloroplast

424

Recently research proposed that MORFs could enhance the interaction or recognition

425

of PPR proteins with RNA targets in vitro (Yan et al., 2017). Although our REMSA

426

results exhibited that PPR756 could bind to the three RNA targets specifically, the

427

binding affinities among the threes targets were different. In view of the involvement

428

of MORF1/8s, we speculated that the distinct binding activities could result from the

429

interactions with the partners of PPR756. Of course, other unknown factors should be

430

also considered in vivo (Fig. 9 ).

431

Meanwhile, PPR756, a mitochondria-located PPR protein, interacted with

432

OsMORF8-1 and OsMORF8-2, two dual-localized proteins, which may also shed

433

light on us that the amount of PPR756 in cell is quite critical. Since the overexpressed

434

or absence of PPR756 could change the distribution of MORFs, we easily checked the

435

alteration of the chlorophyll contents in the OE and mutant lines. Consequently, we

436

believe that the dual-localized proteins such as MORF8 and other PPRs might play an

437

essential role in regrade signal pathway or crosstalk between mitochondrion and

438

chloroplast. Furthermore, mitochondrion and chloroplast are both semi-autonomous

To construct the RNAi lines, a fragment (ranging from 13 to 354 bp) of Os12g19260

446

cDNA was amplified with primers (Table S1) and cloned into the pH7GWIWG(II)

447

vector to construct the RNAi vector. To construct the knock-out lines, in

448

CRISPR-Cas9 system, we chose two target sites close to the start codon ATG to

449

design the gRNAs, which were driven by OsU6a and OsU3. The overexpression lines

460

were extracted from 1-week old etiolated rice seedlings and then transformed with

461

about 10~20 Î¼g plasmids respectively according to a procedure described in previous

462

study (Xiao et al., 2018). Mito Tracker Red (Invitrogen) was used as a mitochondrial

463

specific dye (Invitrogen). The organelle and GFP signals were detected in the Leica

464

microscope (DM4000 B, Germany) using different excitation wavelength. In addition,

465

western blotting was performed to confirm the subcellular localization of PPR756, in

466

which the mitochondria and chloroplasts were extracted from the PPR756 OE lines.

chlorophyll was absolute ethyl alcohol : acetone : water as the ratio of 4.5 : 4.5 : 1.

509

The 0.5 g fresh leaves derived from WT, OE line, KO line, were cut into splices about

510

1 cm and put into 10 ml extracting solution in a dark place for approximately 20h

511

until the leave splices became white. Then, 200 Î¼l pigment solution was taken out to

521

protein containing only MBP and His tags. RNA probes were synthesized and labeled

522

with 6-FAM at the 5â€™ end by GenScript (Nanjing, China). For the RNA

523

electrophoresis mobility shift assays (REMSAs), the dialyzed recombinant protein

524

was incubated with 100 fmol RNA probes in a 10 x binding buffer (100mM HEPES

525

PH=7.3, 200mM KCl, 10mM MgCl2, 10mM DTT) condition and reacted in a 20 Î¼l

526

system for 30 min at 25 oC with 10 units RNasin, followed with separation by 8%

527

native acrylamide gels in a 0.5 Ã— TBE buffer. After the electrophoresis, the gels were

528

screened using a Typhoon Trio Imager (GE).

530

RNA Immunoprecipitation-PCR (RIP-PCR)

531

RIP is a well-developed technology to detect protein-RNA interactions in vivo and

532

involves the immunoprecipitation (IP) of a target protein followed by purification of

533

the associated RNA. Here, the cell lysate was obtained from 2-week-old OE line

534

seedlings which were cross-linked in 0.1% formaldehyde in advance to strengthen

535

protein-RNA interactions. The seedlings were grinded in liquid nitrogen and the

536

powder was resuspended in extraction buffer (Tu et al., 2015). Then we used the

537

anti-Flag antibody to IP the PPR756-Flag fusion protein from the supernatant, and the

538

Scanning electron microscopy assay

543

The samples for SEM assay were prepared according to previous study (Xiao et al.,

544

2018). The seedlings were cut into 1 cm long and mature spikelets were immersed in

545

2.5% glutaraldehyde buffer for 18 h at 4 oC as quickly as possible when separated

546

from the plants. The samples were dehydrated with the help of different concentrate

547

ethyl alcohol at room temperature in every 1 hour and then the dehydrating agent was

548

replaced in order to subsequently critical-point dried. At last, the samples were sputter

549

coated with gold in an ion sputter (E-100, Japan), and observed with a scanning

550

electron microscope (Hitachi S-3000N, Japan).

Blue native PAGE and activity examining of mitochondrial complex

553

The mitochondria were isolated from the calli of the WT, OE and KO lines,

554

respectively, and the equivalent of 500 Âµg of total mitochondrial proteins were treated

555

and loaded on BN-PAGE gel with continuous gradient according to the previous

556

protocol (Liu et al., 2012). The gel was then stained with coomassie brilliant blue.

557

For further verification, the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain

558

complexes, complex I, III, IV and V, were measured using the electron transport chain
