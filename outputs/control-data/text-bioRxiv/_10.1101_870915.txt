neuronal dynamics or neuron–neuron interactions to provide
this modulation (14–17). However, another possibility is that
the neuronal excitability can be modulated by the astrocytes,
which greatly outnumber the neurons in the network (18–21).
It is believed that they can modulate nearby neuronal activities
(22, 23), form tripartite synapses (24) and exhibit calciumexcitability in response to nearby neuronal activities. Since
astrocytic glutamate transporters malfunction can give rise to
excitotoxicity and concomitant epileptic form of SB (25, 26),
it is conceivable that the astrocytes may also modulate the
SB dynamics through synaptic glutamate recycling.
One of the important findings in our understanding of
synaptic dynamics in the last decades is that it can be characterized by the recycling of a conserved amount of resources
as described by Tsodyks, Uziel and Markram (TUM) (27). In
this bipartite synapse model, synaptic resources (glutamate)
of a neuron are recycled through three states: namely the
recovered, active, and inactive states. It is the recovered state
which gives rise to the excitability of a neuron. Physiologically,
it corresponds to the ready-to-release pool of the glutamate
resource. Once released into synapse, it is known that both
neurons and astrocytes can uptake the glutamate from the
synapse (28). Presumably, if the astrocytes can take part in
the recycling process, they should have a significant impact on
the modulation of the excitability of the neurons. Since majority of glutamate is uptaken by the astrocytes, converted to

Synchronous bursting (SB), a collective dynamics of neuronal network, is related to brain functions. Its underlying mechanism still
remains unclear. Recent studies provide sufficient evidence that astrocytes participate in synaptic transmissions. However, the role of
astrocytes in SB is not yet well understood. Here, we investigated
collective dynamics of astrocytes and neurons simultaneously by using cortical cell cultures developed on multi-electrode array (MEA)
systems. Employing glutamate sensors (iGluSnFR) specifically expressed on astrocytes, we observed array-wide rapid rise and fall
of synaptic glutamate level during SB. These glutamate traffics at
synapses are likely responsible for the persistence of neuronal activities for up to seconds. We found that properties of SB events such
as bursting rate and burst duration depend on the activities of GLT-1
glutamate transporters, known to majorly express on astrocytes. In
addition, through genetically-encoded calcium indicator (GECI), we
also observed concomitant array-wide synchronous calcium elevations in astrocytes. By including the glutamate traffics related to
astrocytes, a tripartite synapse model (TUMA) was developed to conform with our experimental observations. Simulation results of the
TUMA model show that astrocytes regulate synaptic transmissions
by fixing the total amount of available glutamate in the pre-synaptic
neuron which in turn controls the dynamics of the SB. During SB, the
tripartite TUMA synapse is basically a traditional bipartite synapse
with the amount of astrocyte-controlled neurotransmitters.

ynchronous firing is ubiquitous in both natural and artificial neural networks (1). These synchronous events
can emerge as low frequency spiking patterns or bursts of
spikes; known as synchronous bursting (SB). In our brain, SB
is observed under physiological conditions (2–4); as well as in
pathological states (5–8). In neuronal cultures, similar spontaneous SB (9), ictal events or seizure-like activities (10, 11)
have also been widely reported. In view of the ubiquity of the
occurrence of SB in both structured (in brains) and randomly
connected networks (in cultures), it is highly likely that there
might be a generic mechanism for SB which is insensitive to
the connection topology.
In the phenomenon of SB, the neuronal system can be
described by two states, the ‘activated state’ (during an SB)
and the ‘dormant state’ (time between SBs). Earlier studies
suggest that the activated state arises from the connectivity
and excitability of the networks (12, 13). Physical connectivity
does not change during the short duration of an SB. Therefore,
modulation of excitability in the system can be a common
mechanism for the SB observed in a variety of systems. Up
to date, most of the studies have focused on the intrinsic,

Significance Statement
Synchronous bursting (SB) in groups of interconnected neurons is a hallmark dynamics of functional neuronal circuits. This
study shows that SBs are, in fact, manifestations of glutamate
dynamics at synapses and its trafficking is orchestrated by
neuron–astrocyte tripartite interactions through astrocytic glutamate transporters (GLT-1). Experimentally we show that the
features of SB in cultured cortical networks depend on GLT-1
function. By including the GLT-1 mediated glutamate recycling,
our tripartite synapse model clarifies that astrocytes modulate
the amount of available glutamate at presynaptic neurons via
multiple timescale depression mechanisms which in turn govern the SB patterns. Our results show that, at least for SB, the
traditional bipartite synapse can still be a good description if
astrocytes-dependent glutamate content is taken into account.

We will refer to the synchronous-discharge state of network
as the ’activated state’, since all neurons collectively remain
active during this state (Figure 1C). Within an activated state
a network exhibits different kinetics, as shown in the firingrate time-histogram (FRTH) plot. FRTH was generated by
summing the total number of array-wide action potentials
detected in a 5 ms bin size. A generic SB’s kinetic structure
consists of the initiation, maintenance, and termination phases
(Figure 1C, bottom). Initiation of SB occurs by assembly of
neuronal activities at an exponential rate (32). Post-assembly
of neuronal firings, array-wide firing reaches a peak level then
gradually decays to the extent where all neuronal spikes ceased
completely. By taking reciprocal of the ISI ranges stated above,
it can be seen that the firing rate in single electrode during the
activated state can range between 10-500Hz. After termination
of the SB, the network maintains a period of quiescence for
several seconds and regains its basal firing activities until next
SB occurs. We will refer to the time between the termination
and the initiation of the next SB as the ‘dormant state’ of
the network. During the dormant state some neurons may
still exhibit spontaneous firings at a rate within the range of
0.1-4Hz.
Synaptic glutamate is regulated during active and dormant
states. Firing dynamics observed in SB involves fast recurrent

glutamine, transported to neurons and followed by conversion
back to glutamate (glutamate-glutamine cycle)(29), the time
scale for the astrocytic glutamate recycling pathway should be
much longer than that for the pre-synaptic neuronal pathway.
One possible consequence of this difference in time scales of
the two pathways is that multiple-time-scale depression in the
SB can be mediated by astrocytes. In fact, recent finding
by Murphy-Royal et al. (30) shows that astrocytic GLT-1
glutamate transporters can dynamically modulate synaptic
events by regulating synaptic glutamate. Also, experiments
with DHK (GLT-1 inhibitor) on cortical cell cultures by Huang
et al. (31) have also shown to alter the period of SBs. These
findings give strong support to the notion that SB could be
consequence of astrocyte-mediated glutamate modulation in
response to neuronal dynamics.
With the picture of astrocytic glutamate recycling above,
we hypothesized that the glutamate-transporter (GluT) system of the astrocytes plays a pivotal role in SB modulation.
We tested this hypothesis by both experiments as well as simulations. For the experiments, glutamate transporters were
targeted in cortical cultures developed on multi-electrode array (MEA). Combining astrocyte-specific fluorescent probes
with MEA, we could monitor the responses from neurons and
astrocytes simultaneously. Our setup with controlled external
environment makes it possible to target the two cell types
specifically using pharmacological tools. To test the validity
of our idea of astrocytic modulation of SB, we developed a
tripartite synapse model to include astrocytes in the glutamate
recycling process. We found that results from both our experiments and simulations were consistent with our hypothesis.
Specifically, the excitability of the neurons were modulated
by the GLT-1 transporters. Different aspects of the SB, such
as the burst duration and bursting frequency, were modified
when the timescale of the transporter’s activity were altered.
The forms of SB were found to be governed by the amount of
glutamate residing in astrocytes.

Results

Active and dormant states in cortical cultures. Neurons in cortical cell cultures develop into self-organized networks forming
recurrent connections (Figure S2). At the same time, astrocytes also develop and extend their processes forming their
own complex network, at the vicinity of neuronal network.
Functionally, the neurons exhibit a wide range of spontaneous
firing patterns (9) during their course of development. Typically, after three weeks of age neuronal connections become
functionally mature, and the array-wide firing patterns turn
stable. Each active electrode of MEA generally display two patterns of neuronal activities: either bursts of spikes followed by
isolated spikes (ch#2,3,7,9,10,14 in Figure 1A), or only bursts
of spikes (ch#1,4,5,6,8,11,12,13). Aligning the temporal activities in all the electrodes, the overall array-wide firing dynamics
thus appears as either asynchronous or synchronous firings
in a network. A distinction between synchronous bursting
and asynchronous spiking events can be made by generating
inter-spike interval (ISI, time interval between successive discharge) return map (Figure 1B). Electrodes which exhibit only
synchronous events, their ISI return map show single cluster
lying within the range of 2–250 ms. Whereas, electrodes which
also show asynchronous firings, display additional clusters of
ISI distributed in the interval between 1–10 sec.

excitation of AMPA and NMDA receptors by synapse-released
glutamate(33, 34). Previous studies indicate that most of the
synaptic glutamate(≈80%) is uptaken by astrocytic processes
through GLT-1 transporters while only a smaller portion is
directly uptaken by the neurons (35, 36). This distinction is
due to the difference in the number of transporter expressions
on the membranes of the two cell types. We performed a
qualitative check on GLT-1 expression in our sample cortical
cultures. Confocal imaging, revealed a highly clustered expression of GLT-1 (see Figure S2) around hub-like clustered
neuronal bodies. A previous study (37) has shown these neuronal hub structures to be composed of organized synaptic
clusters formed by assembly of presynaptic, postsynaptic and
dendritic structures. Observation of intense GLT-1 expressions
implies high glutamate activities at these locations. Our goal
was to detect glutamate dynamics during SBs in the immediate
surrounding of the astrocytes. Therefore, we employed glutamate sensors genetically expressed on astrocytic-membrane
facing extracellular space.
Astrocytes in developing cortical cultures were infected with
adeno-associated viruses expressing GFAP-targeted intensitybased-glutamate-sensing-fluorescent-reporter (iGluSnFr) (38)
(See material and methods in SI for details). This approach
has been previously shown to indicate the kinetics of glutamate
clearance by astrocytes (39). Therefore, we implemented this
method for evaluating GluT activities during SBs. Within
two weeks (post-infection), fluorescence signals from astrocytes were detectable. Simultaneous recording of MEA and
whole field synaptic glutamate imaging, revealed sharply elevated iGluSnFr signals associated with SB events recorded
with MEA(Figure 2A). Its kinetics almost overlapped with
the time course of network’s activated state. Evidently, the
sharp rise in glutamate signal was due to synaptic releases of
glutamate during intense burst firings by neurons. Notably,
the glutamate level rapidly decayed back to baseline level
immediately towards the termination of the SBs(Figure 2B).
Detected iGluSnFr signal continued to remain at its baseline

level until the next SB occurred. The time taken for the decrease of glutamate from its maximum level to half during
SB was defined as τhalf . The glutamate decay time τdecay
(assuming exponential decay function(39)) was computed as
τhalf / ln 2 (Figure 2C) to reflect the glutamate clearance time
by the astrocytes. In our culture system, the decay time was
found to be distributed around 0.26±0.11 s (N=8 cultures).
SB dynamics are modulated by GLT-1 glutamate transporters.

Summary of the changes in array-wide neuronal activities from
reference (Ref) after pharmacological treatments with glutamate
transporter inhibitors; DL-TBOA(10µM), DHK(200µM) or selective
augmentation of GLT-1 glutamate transporter with PAM (positive
allosteric modulator) drug GT949(10µM). Statistical tests: paired t
tests, significance with Ref as baseline was defined as *p<0.05, n
denotes number of cultures.

Analyzing the firing patterns, cultures treated with bicuculline showed significant increase in firing rate (Table 2).
After disinhibition, networks engaged only in synchronous
activities (burst index ≈ 1). Disinhibition also resulted in
significant increase in the duration of SB while maintaining
similar SB frequency compared to reference. To validate the
role of GLT-1 in mediating SB dynamics in disinhibited state
of cortical networks, we also pharmacologically manipulated
GLT-1 transporters. Further addition of DHK did not affect the overall firing rate or the SB index but induced a
re-organization of the firing events into shorter duration with
higher frequency of bursting (Figure 3E). These effects were
reversible as observed after washout of the drugs (see Figure S7–
S8). Adding GT949 in the disinhibited networks decreased the
overall network firing activities significantly while maintained
the high synchronicity caused by disinhibition (Figure 3F).
Under the influence of GT949, burst duration was significantly
shorter, without affecting the SB frequency (Table. 2).

To gain further insights on the role of glutamate transporters
in SBs, we used pharmacological tools to dissect their contribution. Adding GluT-specific inhibitor drugs resulted in
dramatic change in firing and bursting patterns(Figure 3A-B).
Inhibition with DL-TBOA resulted in two-folds increase in
array-wide firings (Table 1, Figure S4). Still there was no significant change in SB frequency. The SB duration was increased
nearly 2.5 times. The level of array-wide spiking activities
during SBs was quantified as SB index (ranging between 0 and
1, see SI for more information). Our cultured networks usually
displayed an SB index of ≈0.8 in their reference recordings.
DL-TBOA treatment significantly increased SB index. We also
observed a rearrangement effect of firing activities in different
samples. Although all networks showed consistent increase of
firing activities after DL-TBOA addition, a range of change
in SB duration was observed across samples. Networks which
showed small increases in burst duration after the drug treatment, showed increased frequency of SB compared to their
reference. Whereas, networks that displayed big increase in
burst duration, showed a decrease in SB frequency. Specific
inhibition of GLT-1 with DHK reproduced the effects similar
to DL-TBOA treatment. The only difference was found in the
SB index of the networks after drug treatment. Contrary to
DL-TBOA effect, DHK addition resulted in increased asynchronous state firings which significantly reduced the burst
index (Table 1, Figure S5). On the other hand, augmenting
GLT-1 function with GT949, a positive allosteric modulator
(PAM) drug, significantly decreased array-wide firings without
affecting SB frequency and SB index. The duration of SBs
became shorter than their reference, a consequence likely due
to reduced firing activities (Figure 3C, S6). These results
indicate that the clearance mechanism by GLT-1 acts as a
major restoring force during SBs by effectively controlling the
amount of glutamate in synapses.

statistics

SBs are not terminated by inhibition. Inputs from the in-

hibitory sub-networks are known to control the excitability of
neurons. It is the interaction between the two which is believed
to regulate the flow of information through the network as
well as shape network activities (40–43). To gain insight on
the contribution of inhibitory inputs in SB, cortical networks
were treated with bicuculline (Bic, GABA antagonist, 10 µM)
to suppress the fast inhibitory effects of γ-aminobutyric acid
(GABA). After bicuculline addition, the SBs became more periodic (Figure 3E-F). Networks in disinhibited state also often
displayed reverberatory activities (sub-bursts) within each SB
event similar to previous report(44). Asynchronous activities
were almost abolished while SBs were more prominent, with
rather clearly-maintained active and dormant phases. The
observation that networks did not fire endlessly and stop until
there is no more activity after bicuculline treatment, show that
termination of SBs do not depend on excitatory-inhibitory
interactions.

Astrocytes display SB-associated synchronous calcium activities. Previous studies have reported astrocytic calcium sen-

sitivity towards synaptic glutamate activities (45). However,
its role in synaptic events still remains unclear. We further
probed calcium activities in astrocytes in spontaneously bursting cortical networks. Cultures were expressed with genetically
encoded calcium sensors (cyto-GCaMP6f) specific to the astrocytes. GCaMP6f imaging revealed asynchronous local calcium
elevation as well as synchronous calcium elevations (SCEs,
Figure 4A). We noticed that, the sequence of astrocytic activation during the global calcium elevation was not random.
A hierarchy in the recruitment of calcium was consistently
observed. This was likely due to an existence of a stable subset
of privileged neurons whose spiking activities reliably increase
before the onset of global SB (32). Combining MEA and
calcium imaging, temporal activities from the two cell types
were recorded simultaneously. Consistently, we observed that
SCEs always emerged towards the end of longer persisting
SBs (Figure 4B). Note that during the SCE in astrocytes, neuronal ongoing activities were completely abolished. Neurons
resumed their basal activity level shortly after decay of SCE
in astrocytes. Importantly, only SBs persisting long enough

(>500 ms) were followed by the astrocytic SCE. Since SBs
result in large glutamate transient at synapses globally, this
transient is likely to triggered collective activation of astrocytic
metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptors(46). A positive
correlation was indeed found between the duration of SB in
neurons and its concomitant SCE in astrocytes. To validate
whether glutamate released by the SBs were responsible for
SCE in astrocytes, cultures were treated with riluzole (glutamate release inhibitor, 10 µM). Treatment with riluzole
resulted in suppressed neuronal activities with complete abolition of SBs and associated SCEs (Figure S9). Although
neurons maintained some asynchronous firings, no astrocytic
SCE was observed after addition of riluzole, indicating SB
dependency of synchronous calcium activities in astrocytes.

the astrocytic uptake by DHK treatment in our experiments.
These increases reflect the fact that more glutamate becomes
available in the synapse while A gets smaller. Figure 5D(a–b)
shows that A remained relatively constant during the SBs
however its mean value was sensitive to the value of τau . A
change of τau from 200 ms to 300 ms decreased A from 0.71
to 0.66. A further increase in τau would decrease A to an even
smaller value and vice versa. These findings were consistent
with the schematic picture that A works as a temporary storage
for the glutamate and can modulate the amount of available
glutamate in the synapse(49). With the parameters used to
reproduce experiment observations, the simulation revealed
that A remains relatively constant and sets the amount of
glutamate available to X.

terns obtained from MEA experiments show how the dynamics
of SB changes under various conditions. We used these firing
patterns as input to obtain relevant parameters for our tripartite synapse TUMA model. This model describes how glutamate gets relocated to different parts of a tripartite synapse.
For details, please refer to the supplementary information
(SI). The essentials of this model can be understood from
the schematic diagram shown in Figure 5A. The amount of
glutamate (expressed as fractions) in the system can be in X
(ready-to-release pool), Y (activated state; producing EPSC),
Z (pool of glutamate uptaken from the synapse), and A (glutamate uptaken by astrocyte). Similar to the TUM model(27),
we implemented conservation of glutamate in the tripartite
synapse; with X + Y + Z + A = 1. The glutamate transporters targeted in this study are related to the two uptake
time scales in TUMA synapse; τnu (neuronal uptake) and τau
(astrocytic uptake). The values of τnu and τau were obtained
and fixed in a manner to match the simulated firing patterns
with the experimental observations. These time constants and
the model mechanism were the basis of our understanding on
how glutamate dynamics control the properties of SB.

Synchronous bursting events. Figure 5C shows the raster plot of

typical noise-induced synchronous firing events in 100 neurons
randomly connected through TUMA synapses. The time
course of X, Y , Z, and A during the SB events are also shown
in the figure. Simulation parameters (see Table S1) were chosen
such that the firing patterns were similar to experimental
firing patterns (Figure 5B) and consistent with published
values(47, 48). Before the onset of SB, the fraction X was at
its maximum, while Z was at its minimum. Most of the changes
in X were supplied from Z. Once the SB is triggered, a steep
rise in Y happens similar to our experimental observations
(Figure 2). One remarkable feature shown in the figure is that
during an SB, changes in X and Z were large while only very
small changes occurred in A. These changes in A during SB
were small because of the slow process for A to turn into Z.
If this later process was much faster, one would expect bigger
changes in A during an SB event.
Slower astrocytic uptake increases SB rate and duration. The effects

of the astrocyte uptake time scale on the properties of SB are
shown in Figure 5D(a–b). It can be seen that an increase in
τau , from 200 ms to 300 ms, caused a substantial increase in the
overall firings, bursting rate, bursting duration and burst index
(Figure 5E). This effect should be similar to the inhibition of

SB can be produced by a fixed A. A remains nearly constant dur-

ing SBs for different values of τau as shown in Figures 5D, a–b.
These results suggest that astrocytes do not directly take part
in the generation of an SB. Still, their role is to set the amount
of available glutamate in the synaptic dynamics. By fixing
A as a constant (Figures 5D, c–d), it can be seen that SBs
were generated similar to the experiments, indicating that the
dynamics of A is not important for the generation of SB. By
fixing A, our tripartite synapse was in fact reduced to a bipartite synapse. As a bipartite (TUM) synapse is governed by
X + Y + Z = 1, fixing A was equivalent to X + Y + Z = 1 − A,
were 1 − A became another constant <1. This finding strongly
suggests that the main role of astrocytes in generation of SB
is to limit the amount of glutamate available in the bipartite
synapse. The availability of glutamate then governs the firing
patterns in SBs.
Slower transformation of A to Z decreases SB rate and duration. Ac-

cording to our TUMA model, the amount of glutamate in the
A state can be varied either by varying τau or τg . Here τg
represents the timescale for glutamate-glutamine cycle which
is followed by astrocytic glutamate uptake. Previous research
have shown the importance of this cycle for the generation
of bursting activities in neurons (50, 51). Figure 5E shows
network bursting statistics under combinations of different τau
and τg . Although τg has been used as an overly simplified
representation of multiple processes that occur in the course
of glutamate transport from astrocytes to neurons in this

study, these simulation results provide an estimated range of
τg within which this recovery may take place. From the data
pooled from our cortical culture experiments, the reference SB
statistics were found to be in the following ranges: array-wide
firing rate (≈26 spikes/s), SB duration (≈0.29 s), SB index
(≈0.82), and SB rate (≈5 SBs/minute). Also, the glutamate
decay time (τdecay ) measured across networks was found to be
≈0.26 s. In order to align with these values, it can be seen from
Figure 5 that τg should lie around 30s range. Furthermore,
the effect of blocking astrocytic glutamate-glutamine cycle on
bursting activities in the previous reports(50, 51) comply with
effect of increasing τg .

Experimental evidence across brain regions show that vesicle
release can occur at the rate of 0.3–70 vesicles per spike (52, 53),
each vesicle carrying about 4,000 glutamate molecules (54).
Now, considering a presynaptic firing rate of 100 Hz, a synapse
can witness 1.2×105 –2.8×107 molecules of glutamate turnover
per second. Hence, an SB event involving millions of synapses
can cause a massive rise in synaptic glutamate level. Their
dwelling time in the synaptic region is very likely to dictate the
post-synaptic response duration. Therefore, a gating system
is necessary to limit the extent of glutamatergic excitation
and thus limit the persistence of firing events. Since the
majority of glutamate re-uptake happens via astrocytic GLT-1
GluTs, they qualify to be an important regulatory body during
synchronous neurotransmissions. Indeed, our experimental
and simulation results show that SBs observed in cortical
cultures are associated with re-distribution of a conserved
amount of glutamate in different forms and locations.
The main finding of our experiments and simulations is that
the amount of glutamate in astrocytes govern the collective
dynamics in SB. Based on our modeling, the effects of A on the
phenomenon of SB can be divided into the following phases:
Initiation and positive feedback: In the dormant phase of the
network, the number of asynchronous release increases(see Figure 1) before SB. These releases come from the noise-induced
release of X which build up slowly during the dormant state.
If these release events become large enough and the connectivity in the network is also high enough, action potentials
gets triggered in some neurons. Once this happens, more
glutamate gets released by these action potentials triggering
more neurons to fire due to recurrent connections in the system. Consequently, this positive feedback then triggers a
system-wide firing events.
Maintenance of burst (activated phase): The positive feedback
can be maintained as long as there is enough X to be released
to trigger further action potentials. Depending on the system
parameters (A level), sub-burst in the form of reverberations
can also be possible because of the interaction between synaptic
facilitation and depression in the TUM mechanism. One
would expect reverberations to be more easily observed in a
system with only excitatory inputs similar to experiments with
bicuculline. This is because for systems with both inhibitory
and excitatory inputs, there should be a wider and weaker
distribution of input currents to the neurons. Intuitively,
system with higher X (lower A) should have longer bursting
duration because it will take longer for X to deplete to a certain
threshold. Indeed, we see from both experiments (Table 1)
and simulations (Figure 5D) that SB duration decreases with

the amount of glutamate in the astrocyte.
Termination of burst: During the activated state of SB, the
ready-to-release glutamate molecules (X) are constantly being
transformed into Z, via multiple timescale processes, which
will then be turned slowly back to X controlled by another
long time constant. Due to overall slower recovery mechanism,
X is not replenished fast enough from Z. The action potential
triggered release from the pre-synaptic cell will be then too
small to elicit action potentials at the post-synaptic cell. In
this scenario, the positive feedback can no longer be sustained
and the bursting will stop.
Dormant phase (deactivated phase): Once the system is in the
dormant state, system-wide firings stop and there are only isolated spikes created by noise-driven releases. During this phase,
X can slowly recover from Z. As X increases, the amount of
noise-driven-released glutamate will also increase, raising the
probability of triggering a system-wide depolarization.
In our TUMA model, we assumed that the amount of
glutamate is conserved within the tripartite synapse. As
we have shown in our simulations (Figure 5), the effect of
astrocytes in our tripartite synapse is to control the level of
glutamate available to neurons. During the different phases
of SB, there is very little change in A. In fact, one can
even fix A and still obtain qualitatively similar collective
bursting patterns. In this latter case, we are back to the
traditional bipartite synapses (TUM model with X+Y +Z
being a constant but less than one). The role of astrocytes
here is to set the overall level of A through the two processes
of uptake from Y and transforming A to X. Therefore, even
if there is a violation of the conservation, it will not invalidate
our conclusion as long as the overall A is fixed to a certain
level.
Termination of SBs were found to be independent of inputs
from inhibitory sub-networks. Pharmacologically removing
the inhibition, with addition of bicuculline, although enhanced
firing probability of networks resulting in longer SBs, the
SBs were eventually terminated and followed by dormant
states. Our simulation shows that the dormant state is in fact
the network’s refractory period during which there is a slow
recovery of glutamate in X. During the recovery, the neuronal
network could not generate another SB due to insufficient
glutamate available in the presynapse. This recovery process
can be regarded as a slow negative feedback mechanism, which
effectively controls the occurrence of SBs.
During the activated state, it is clear that there are SCEs
in the astrocytes (Figure 4). Its contribution was unaccounted
for in our TUMA model. From Figure 4B, the SCEs in astrocytes appear to have a role in the termination of SBs. For such
an observation, there are multiple possible scenarios: First,
calcium elevation may trigger astrocytic transmitters (’gliotransmitter’) release into the synapses which may suppress the
persisting neuronal activities(55). Two possible candidates are
ATP/adenosine(46, 56) and nitric oxide(57) which have been
reported to suppress hetero-synaptic activities. Second, the
SCE may also be associated with recruitment of additional
astrocytic GluTs for more rapid uptake of glutamate from
the synapse. These two processes may also occur simultaneously. In a contrasting scenario, astrocytic concomitant
SCE response could be positive feedback mechanism associated with increased glutamine transport to the neurons or
calcium-induced glutamate release(58). It required further

experiments to test these hypotheses.
With the picture described above, the SB phenomenon
can be considered as a generic property of a neuron-astrocyte
system. No special circuits or burster neurons are needed
for its generation. We show that such collective dynamics is
an outcome of synergistic interactions between neurons and
astrocytes as demonstrated in the TUMA model. The most
important finding in our work is that, the firing and bursting patterns of the neurons are governed by the amount of
glutamate in the astrocytes (A). It is possible that different
regions of brain can have different amount A in the astrocytes
locally, allowing different firing and bursting patterns at different brain regions. In this sense, the astrocytes are modulating
the bursting of neurons in the network.
Finally, we like to point out that neurological disorders
such as seizure-like epilepsy and even behavioural changes
can be associated with GLT-1 malfunction(59–63). Our study
contributes to the understanding of how altered uptake mechanisms can affect a network’s firing and bursting activities,
which are representative of brain circuit’s functions. In the
astrocyte targeted experiment of Bechtholt-Gompf et. al. and
John et. al. (61, 63), a depression-like behaviour was induced
in rats by DHK treatment; the same drug used here. If we
extend our findings to understand their observations, it seems
that the increase in firings induced by the DHK are the origin
of such changes. In terms of our model, this is just a decrease in
the level of glutamate in the astrocytes (the A state). This last
observation is consistent with the current view that astrocytes
can be important in shaping the behaviour of animals(64).

(A) Time series of extracellular field potentials of a sample cortical network, recorded with 14 electrodes using a multi-electrode array probe.
Spontaneous electrical activities of cortical neurons in a developing network (22 days in vitro) appear as asynchronous or synchronous firings. (B)
A inter-spike interval (ISI) distribution, generated by plotting time intervals (top) between successive firings, show a distinction between
synchronous and asynchronous firing events. Electrode#1 engaging only in synchronous firings exhibit only one dense cluster of ISI lying in 2–100
ms range (middle), while the electrode#2 also engaging in asynchronous firings show additional ISI clusters lying above 1 sec region (bottom). (C)
Raster plot of detected spikes (top, black trace) illustrates two states of network in general: ’activated’ state when all units exhibit synchronous
burst (SB) firings followed by a ’dormant’ state in which most units show no to very few activities. Corresponding firing-rate time histogram
(FRTH) (bottom trace in blue), calculated by summing all the detected spikes within 5 ms bin size, displays the kinetic structure of network’s
states. The kinetics involve an initiation (a), maintenance (b), and termination (c) phases followed by a much longer dormant phase (d).

resulted in more robust SB patterns with clear activated and dormant Time
states
of network. Resulting SBs were longer than reference. Further DHK
(200µM) addition, enhanced SB frequency and reduced SB duration at the same time. Enhancing GLT-1 function with GT949 (10µM) treatment
in disinhibited state (network in F), resulted in shorter SBs.

Note that all neuronal activities ceased during the global calcium rise in astrocytes. Neuronal activity reappeared soon after the SCE decay. (Top

at
time t = tspk , arriving at the presynapse, trigger glutamate release into
the cleft. Released glutamate molecules rapidly activate the post synaptic fast receptors until their clearance by neuronal and astrocytic uptake
with timescales τnu and τau respectively. The astrocytic uptake follows glutamate–glutamine cycle leading to slow recovery of glutamate at the
timescale of τg in the presynapse. Once recovered, glutamate gets packed into vesicles and retrieved back at the active zone within τr . During this
recovery process, some neurons may exhibit noise(ξ) induced asynchronous release. (B) Shows FRTH (blue trace, bin size 5ms) and raster plot
(black trace) of neuronal activities obtained from MEA. (C) Similar firing and bursting patterns were obtained from simulation (random network of
100 neurons connected with TUMA synapses). Simulated normalized FRTH trace (bin size 5ms) is overlapped with the four-state X(red),
Y (green), Z(blue), and A(yellow) dynamics of glutamate occurring simultaneously in the network. These traces denotes the average fraction of
glutamate distributed around synapse. For visual clarity, Y is shown 5 times its actual values. (D) Effects of varying the astrocytic uptake
timescale on network firing patterns(FRTH, gray trace). Subplots D(b–d) share the same vertical and horizontal axis scales with D(a). Increasing
τau from 200 ms to 300 ms resulted in longer and frequent SBs similar to DHK effects.(D,c–d) By fixing A to the mean values (0.71 and 0.66)
obtained from τau (200 and 300ms) did not affect the SB patterns.(E) Summary of network firing statistics dependence on astrocytic uptake rate
τau and transport τg . Each data point represents the mean value obtained at the specified parameter values. Effects of varying τg , i.e., recovery
time of glutamate from astrocytes is shown in color-coded traces. Overlapped vertical and horizontal broken gray lines represent the approximate
mean value of glutamate decay time (τdecay analogue for astrocytic glutamate uptake, τau ) obtained from experiment (Figure 2C) and the
approximate SB statistical mean values obtained from MEA data analysis respectively. The simulated firing and SB statistics were found to match
with experimental observations when τg was close to 30s.
