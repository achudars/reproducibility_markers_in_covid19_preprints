Abstract
Cell-fate decisions during development are controlled by densely interconnected gene regulatory networks (GRNs) consisting of many genes. Inferring and predictively modeling these
GRNs is crucial for understanding development and other physiological processes. Gene
circuits, coupled differential equations that represent gene product synthesis with a switchlike function, provide a biologically realistic framework for modeling the time evolution of
gene expression. However, their use has been limited to smaller networks due to the computational expense of inferring model parameters from gene expression data using global
non-linear optimization. Here we show that the switch-like nature of gene regulation can be
exploited to break the gene circuit inference problem into two simpler optimization problems
that are amenable to computationally efficient supervised learning techniques. We present
FIGR (Fast Inference of Gene Regulation), a novel classification-based inference approach to
determining gene circuit parameters. We demonstrate FIGR’s effectiveness on synthetic data
as well as experimental data from the gap gene system of Drosophila. FIGR is faster than
global non-linear optimization by nearly three orders of magnitude and its computational
complexity scales much better with GRN size. On a practical level, FIGR can accurately
infer the biologically realistic gap gene network in under a minute on desktop-class hardware
instead of requiring hours of parallel computing. We anticipate that FIGR would enable the
inference of much larger biologically realistic GRNs than was possible before. FIGR Source

Introduction

Development is controlled by gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that interpret extrinsic signals to make decisions about cell fate [6, 23]. The same principle also applies to the maintenance of populations of replenishable cell-types such as blood cells during adult homeostasis
or to the in vitro reprogramming of cell identity [11]. Transcription factors (TFs) provide the
connectivity in GRNs since they modulate the transcription rate of target genes by binding
specific sites in non-coding DNA neighboring the gene and recruiting cofactor proteins that
interact with the polymerase holoenzyme complex or modify the accessibility of DNA. Unlike direct regulation by TFs, non-TF gene products can regulate target gene transcription
indirectly. For example, the abundance of receptor proteins modulates the transduction of
extracellular signals [30].
Inferring and modeling the genetic control logic of cell-fate determination is necessary
not only for understanding the basic principles of development and physiology but also for
further progress in regenerative medicine. Over the past decade or so, it has become clear
that developmental GRNs comprise tens to hundreds of densely interconnected genes [7, 29]
rather than a few so-called master regulators. Moreover, developmental GRNs are wired
recursively since the genes encoding TFs are themselves regulated by other TFs or indirectly
by non-TF genes products. Their large size and high interconnectivity make the inference
and predictive modeling of developmental GRNs a challenging problem.

GRNs can be reverse engineered from gene expression data sampled in time, in different
cell types, or in different mutant backgrounds with a variety of statistical approaches [20,
26, 33]. One specific reverse-engineering methodology, termed gene circuits, has been particularly successful in inferring and modeling developmental GRNs [15, 31, 38]. Gene circuits model protein or mRNA concentrations using coupled nonlinear ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) in which synthesis is represented as a switch-like function of regulator
concentrations. The values of the free parameters define GRN connectivity. Gene circuits
do not presuppose any particular connectivity, but instead determine it by estimating the
values of the parameters from data using global nonlinear optimization techniques [5, 21, 22].
In contrast to other reverse engineering methods, gene circuits infer not only the topology of
the network but also the type, either activation or repression, and strength of interactions.
Most importantly, the inference procedure yields ODE models that can be used to simulate
and predict developmental perturbations [16, 24, 25, 37, 39].
Despite its successes, the gene circuit method suffers from two drawbacks that have
hamstrung its application to larger networks and other developmental systems. The first
limitation is that gene circuit parameter inference is computationally intensive and scales
with G3 , where G is the number of genes. Because of this, gene circuits have only been
inferred for relatively small networks of fewer than 10 genes so far [4, 24, 27]. The second
limitation is that, parameter identifiability is relatively poor and only the sign of interaction,
but not its strength, is inferable for the majority of network connections [2] in apparently
well-determined problems.
In this paper we present an alternative approach, FIGR (Fast Inference of Gene Regulation), for determining gene circuit parameters that overcomes the first drawback by being
significantly more computationally efficient than simulated annealing. Our algorithm exploits the observation that the inference of the connectivity of a given gene can be rephrased
as a supervised learning problem: to find a hyperplane in phase space that classifies observations into two groups, one where the gene is ON and the other where the gene is OFF.
Our algorithm determines whether a gene is ON or OFF at a given observation point by
computing the time derivative of concentrations in a numerically robust manner. It then
performs classification using either logistic regression or support vector machines (SVM) to
determine the equation of the switching hyperplane. The genetic interconnectivity can then
be computed from the coefficients of the hyperplane equation in a straightforward manner.
We have implemented the algorithm in MATLAB and tested its ability to recover the genetic
interconnectivity of random GRNs from simulated data. The algorithm works as expected
and recovers parameters accurately. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to correctly infer the Drosophila gap gene regulatory network from empirical data. We observed
a ∼600-fold speed up relative to simulated annealing on the gap gene problem. Finally, we
discuss how conceiving of and visualizing gene circuit inference as a classification problem
promises to provide insight into parameter identifiability.

representing the switch-like nature of gene regulation. Rg is the maximum synthesis rate of
product g, Tgf are genetic interconnectivity coefficients describing the regulation of gene g
by the product of gene f , hg determines the basal synthesis rate, and λg is the degradation
rate of product g. Nominally, all genes in the model also function as regulators, so that both
g and f run over the range 1, 2, 3, . . . , G. Sometimes such gene networks include upstream
regulators that are not themselves influenced by other gene products represented in the
model. For example, in the Drosophila segmentation gene network, maternal proteins such
as Bicoid activate the zygotically expressed genes, but are not regulated by their targets [1].
An upstream regulator g can be represented by setting Tgf = 0 for all f .
2.1.1

Glass networks

Here, we utilize gene circuits in which gene state switching is represented with the Heaviside
regulation-expression function

0 if u < 0
Θ(u) =
1 if u ≥ 0.
The resulting differential equations are piece-wise linear and are referred to as Glass networks [8, 9]. Glass networks are capable of exhibiting a rich variety of dynamical behaviors
such as multistability, limit cycles, and chaos [10, 28].
Using the state vector x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xG ) to represent a point in the G-dimensional phase
space of the model and the vector Tg to represent the gth row of the genetic interconnectivity
matrix, the Glass equations may be written as
dxg

g = 1, 2, 3, . . . , G.

The gene may said to be “ON” or “OFF” depending on whether the gene product is being
synthesized or not respectively. Equation (3) implies that

Thus the “gene g ON” and “gene g OFF” configurations are separated in phase space by the
hyperplane defined by the equation Tg · x + hg = 0. We call this the switching hyperplane.
Tg is the normal to the switching hyperplane and Tg · x + hg is the perpendicular distance
of any point x to the hyperplane. Furthermore,

xg (0)e−λg t + Rλgg (1 − e−λg t ) if the gene is ON
(5)
xg (t) =
xg (0)e−λg t
if the gene is OFF.
Equations (4) and (5) imply that for Glass networks, the regulatory parameters, T and hg ,
and the kinetic parameters, Rg and λg , are separable. The former determine the switching
hyperplane, while the latter determine the trajectories on either side of the hyperplane.
Figure 1D,G shows examples of the switching hyperplanes and trajectory of a two-gene gene
circuit (Fig. 1A,B) having a stable spiral equilibrium solution.

2.2

FIGR: Classification-based inference

In FIGR, we exploit the separability of the regulatory and kinetic parameters to break up the
inference problem into two distinct tractable subproblems. For inferring the parameters of
any given gene, we classify the data points into two classes—one in which the gene’s product
is being synthesized (ON class) and the other in which the product is not being synthesized
(OFF class). The regulatory parameters are inferred by determining the optimal G − 1
dimensional hyperplane separating the two classes. The kinetic parameters can be inferred
either by fitting the piece-wise linear Glass equations to estimates of the rate of change of
gene product concentrations or by fitting Equation 5 to the gene product concentration time
series.
2.2.1

bounded by the maximum concentration determined by the synthesis and degradation rates,

Gene expression data, such as those obtained from immunofluorescence or high-throughput
sequencing, inevitably contain noise. If the gene expression level is close to its maximum
g
(xg ≈ Rg /λg ) or minimum level (xg ≈ 0), dx
is theoretically close to zero, but noise causes
dt
dxg
sgn dt to fluctuate, which might be interpreted as spurious switching events. To avoid this
problem, we identify a gene’s ON/OFF state as follows. If the gene expression level xg
is increasing (decreasing) at a rate greater than a user-supplied velocity threshold vgc , then
the gene is classified as ON (OFF). Otherwise, if the expression level is above (below) a
user-supplied expression threshold xcg , then the gene is classified as ON (OFF). This can be
summarized as

In our implementation of FIGR, cubic smoothing splines are fit to time series data and
differentiated to estimate velocity. Figure 1E,H illustrates the determination of yg for an
example two-gene network.
2.2.2

Determining regulatory parameters

Within the Glass model, the ON/OFF state of a particular target gene g, whose index
we shall omit from now on, is given by y = sgn (T · x + h) . Suppose that gene product
concentrations have been sampled P times, in time and in one or more conditions or cell
types. The gene ON/OFF state yp is determined for each experimentally measured state
vector xp , p = 1, 2, 3, . . . , P , according to the method described above (Section 2.2.1). Then,
the regulatory parameters can be inferred by finding T̃ and h̃ such that


(11)
yp = sgn T̃ · xp + h̃
is satisfied for as many p as possible. Inferring the regulatory parameters therefore reduces
to the problem of linear binary classification [14].
There are many well known supervised learning algorithms for linear binary classification.
We have used both support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression. An SVM finds
a hyperplane buffered by the biggest possible margin such that the number of points xp
belonging to each class, “gene ON” or “gene OFF”, is maximized on opposite sides of the
margin zone. This can be accomplished by minimizing the cost function

proportional to its distance from the margin. The parameter λ is used to choose the relative
weight of the penalty and loss terms. Two-class logistic regression models the posterior
probability of the ON/OFF state of a point as a logit transformation of its distance from
the switching hyperplane. The optimal switching hyperplane can be found
 by−yminimizing
Equation (12) with a Binomial deviance loss function L(yp , xp ) = log 1 + e p (T·xp +h) .
Figure 1C,F,I illustrate binary classification for an example two-gene network.
Minimization of Equation (12) is a convex optimization problem, which can be solved by
quadratic programming or the Newton-Raphson method quite efficiently, even for large G.
This is the key benefit of the separation of regulatory and kinetic parameters enabled by the
Glass equations.
2.2.3

Determining kinetic parameters

Having identified the ON/OFF state of a gene, yp , for P measurements of its concentration,
xp , the Glass equations (Eq. 3) can be rewritten as

series data (Section 2.2.1). Thus, for any particular gene, Equation (13) takes the form of
P equations that are linear in the two unknowns R and λ. This is an overdetermined linear
system, so best estimates for R and λ can be extracted by least-squares linear regression.
In practice, the error in the spline, and hence in v, is the largest when a gene is switching
states. We therefore exclude a user-configurable number of time points nearest to switching
events. This method is implemented as the ‘‘slope’’ method of FIGR. Alternatively, R
and λ can also be determined by fitting Equation 5 to the concentration data (see Section S1
of Supplementary Materials).

Inference of the Drosophila gap gene network

Gene circuit equations for a spatially extended system

The gene circuit describes the time evolution of the concentrations of the gap proteins in
a one-dimensional row of N nuclei lying along the anteroposterior axis of the embryo [24]
during cleavage cycle 14. The lack of cell membranes in the syncitium implies that proteins
can diffuse between nuclei (cells) and Equation (1) is modified to incorporate discretized
Fickian diffusion and anteroposterior position, so that

Here xng (t) is the expression level of protein g in nucleus n at time t, Dg is the diffusion
constant for protein g, and S(u) is the sigmoid regulation-expression function (Eq. 2). Zeroflux boundary conditions are used at the ends of the modeled region, while initial conditions
are given by the empirical data from cycle 13.
2.3.2

Model and spatiotemporal data

We inferred a gene circuit for the gap genes hunchback (hb), Krüppel (Kr), giant (gt), and
knirps (kni). The model includes the upstream regulators Bicoid (Bcd), Caudal (Cad),
and Tailless (Tll), so that G = 7. Other gap genes expressed in the head and tail of the
embryo [15] are not included in the model, and so it is restricted to N = 58 nuclei lying
between 35%–92% egg length (EL).
The gene circuit was inferred from a publicly available whole-mount immunofluorescence
dataset [35] of the spatiotemporal expression of the segmentation genes. Data from the 50
minute-long cleavage cycle 14 are staged into 8 time classes, T1–T8, spaced 6.25 mins apart.
We utilized integrated data [24] obtained by subtracting background fluorescence from raw
single-embryo data, aligning the spatial patterns of different embryos belonging to a time
class, and averaging over several embryos in each time class. See Janssens et al. [19] for
details of how the data were processed.
2.3.3

Classification-based Inference

The determination of ON/OFF state and inference of regulatory parameters Tg and hg is
carried out as described above in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. In addition to Rg and λg , spatially
extended gene circuits have an additional set of kinetic parameters, the diffusion constants
Dg .
We exploited so-called kink solutions to the gene circuit equations [36] to estimate the
kinetic parameters. Let gene g be ON in an anteroposterior domain [l, r] so that there is
net diffusion out of the domain into surrounding OFF nuclei. Then the balance of synthesis,
degradation, and diffusion will establish a stable gradient,

steady state.
In order to infer the kinetic parameters, we first determine the time class in which a
gene is expressed at the highest level, since the spatial gradient would best approximate
steady state at that time point. Next, we identify gene-expression domains as local maxima
in the spatial pattern in that time class. For genes having multiple expression domains,
such as hb and gt, the domain with the highest expression is chosen. The gene is expressed
at half maximum at the domain borders (Eq. 15). Therefore, border positions (l or r) are
determined as nuclei where the expression is half of the domain peak. Rg , λg , and Dg are

then determined by fitting Equation (15) to the observed expression data for n > r and
n < l using MATLAB’s lsqnonlin function. This is implemented as the ‘‘kink’’ method
of FIGR.
2.3.4

Refinement of parameters for smooth gene circuits

For gene circuits with diffusion, the correspondence between velocity vg and ON/OFF state
yg (Eq. 9) will be violated for a few nuclei lying adjacent to nuclei in which the gene is ON.
Such nuclei would have positive velocity despite the gene being OFF because of diffusion
of the protein from adjacent “ON nuclei”. Although this effect is limited to a few nuclei,
it would nevertheless result in slightly inaccurate parameter estimates. For this reason, we
refineP
the parameters inferred by FIGR using local optimization. The objective function is
2
χ = ngt (x̃ng (t) − xng (t))2 , where x̃ng (t) are data and xng (t) are solutions of Equation (14).
χ2 was minimized with MATLAB’s fminsearch, which utilizes the Nelder-Mead algorithm
to conduct an unconstrained local search starting from parameters inferred with FIGR.
2.3.5

Comparison with simulated annealing and timing

Simulated annealing was carried out with gene circuit C code as described previously [24].
Wall clock time was measured with C’s time function or MATLAB’s tic/toc functions for
simulated annealing and FIGR respectively.

2.4

Validation of FIGR with synthetic data

Random gene circuits were generated and simulated to generate synthetic data as follows.
Rg and λg were drawn uniformly from the interval [0.5, 2]. We chose Tgf and hg such that
the switching hyperplane passed through a random point xcen drawn uniformly from the
< Rλgg ), and the normal to the switching hyperplane (T̂g ) was
bounding hypercube (0 < xcen
g
drawn uniformly from the unit hypersphere. We generated N trajectories starting at random
initial position xn (t = 0) drawn uniformly from the bounding hypercube by integrating the
Glass equations without diffusion (Eq. 3) using MATLAB’s ode45 solver. We stored the
values of these functions xng (tk ) at 41 timepoints tk = 0, 0.05, . . . , 2 to serve as synthetic
data for FIGR.

Validation of FIGR on synthetic data

As a first test of FIGR, we tested its ability to recover known parameters from synthetic
data (see Section 2.4 for details). In each test, 10, 000 randomly generated gene circuits
were simulated using the diffusion-less Glass equations (Eq. 3). For each gene circuit, N
trajectories starting from random initial starting points were computed and sampled at 40
time points to obtain synthetic time series data. The parameters were inferred from the

synthetic data using FIGR (Section 2.2) and compared with the known values by computing
the discrepancies, δT = kT̃g − Tg k, δh = |h̃g − hg |, δR = |R̃g − Rg |, and δλ = |λ̃g − λg |, where
T̃g , h̃g , R̃g , and λ̃g are inferred parameter values. The user-defined options and parameters
utilized in this study are provided in Table S1 (Supplementary Material).
Figure 2A shows the frequency distributions of the discrepancies for 10, 000 two-gene
networks. Given that Tg and T̃g are unit normal vectors to the theoretical and inferred
hyperplanes
respectively, δT gives the angle between the two normals when it is small, while
√
δT = 2 implies that the inferred hyperplane is orthogonal to the theoretical one. The
switching hyperplane has been inferred accurately (δT < 0.1 or 6◦ angle to the theoretical
normal) for the vast majority of random gene circuits. The inference of hg and the kinetic
parameters is similarly accurate. The inference of the genetic interconnectivity depends on
the number of sampled data points and the number of modeled genes as one would expect
(Fig. 2B). The accuracy improves with increasing number of trajectories (N ) and decreases
with increasing number of genes (G) if the number of data points is held constant.

Although the inference is quite accurate, the discrepancies are not zero for most gene circuits and can be fairly large for a small number of gene circuits. This results from constraints
imposed by the intrinsic dynamics of gene circuits and finite sample size. For instance, trajectories move away from the switching hyperplane for autoactivating genes. In this case,
the initial conditions act as support vectors for the inferred hyperplane, which then strongly

a hyperplane that divides the bounding hypercube into ON and OFF regions in a lopsided
manner. Since initial points are sampled uniformly, this results in too few sampled points in
the vicinity of the hyperplane and poor inference. These considerations are also valid when
inferring GRNs from empirical data. Such insights and their implications for parameter
identifiability will be described elsewhere. Notwithstanding these constraints, our analysis
demonstrates that FIGR is capable of inferring parameters quantitatively when provided
with a sufficient number of data points.

Gap gene network inference

We tested the efficacy of FIGR on empirical data by inferring a gene circuit for the gap
gene network acting during Drosophila segmentation. We provide a very brief summary of
the segmentation system here; a more complete description may be found in reviews by
Akam [1] or Jaeger [18]. The segmentation proteins pattern the anteroposterior axis during
the first three hours of embryogenesis. During this period, the embryo is a syncitium, so
that nuclei lack cell membranes and undergo 13 mitotic divisions, termed cleavages. After
the tenth cleavage cycle, the majority of the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the embryo
and are arranged in a monolayer, forming a syncitial blastoderm. Cellular membranes form
by invagination of the plasma membrane in the latter half of cleavage cycle 14, at the end
of which the embryo undergoes gastrulation.
Near the end of cleavage cycle 14, the segmentation genes are expressed in spatially resolved patterns that specify the position of each cell to an accuracy of one cell diameter.
Segmentation gene expression is initiated by shallow protein gradients formed by the translation of localized mRNAs, such as bicoid (bcd) and caudal (cad), deposited in the oocyte
by the mother. These maternal protein gradients regulate the gap genes, which commence
mRNA expression in cleavage cycle 10–12 and are expressed in broad domains ∼20 nuclei
wide during cycle 14. The gap genes in turn regulate the pair-rule and segment-polarity
genes that provide the molecular prepattern for the subsequent segmentation of the embryo.
All the maternal and gap proteins are known to act as transcription factors that regulate
each others’ expression in a complex GRN that has been modeled extensively [3, 12, 13, 15–
17, 24, 25, 32, 36–38], providing an ideal test of FIGR.
We inferred a gene circuit for the gap genes hunchback (hb), Krüppel (Kr), giant (gt),
and knirps (kni) regulated by the upstream factors bcd, cad, and tailless (tll). The equations
utilize the sigmoid regulation-expression function and include the effects of the spatial diffusion of gap proteins (Section 2.3.1). The gene circuit models the protein expression of these
genes between 35%–92% egg length during cleavage cycle 14 (Section 2.3.2). The dataset is
comprised of immunofluorescence protein concentration measurements at the resolution of
individual nuclei at eight timepoints during cleavage cycle 14 (Fig. 3A).
The regulatory and kinetic parameters were inferred with FIGR (Section 2.3.3). The
user-defined options and parameters utilized for fitting the gap gene circuit are provided in
Table S1 (Supplementary Material). Figure 3B shows that the assignment of ON/OFF states
using slope estimates (Section 2.2.1) correctly recapitulates the extent and dynamics of the
gene expression domains. The regulatory parameters T̃g and h̃g were inferred by supervised

values, ỹg = sgn T̃x · xg + h̃g (Fig. 3C), are in good agreement with the empirical ON/OFF
classification and the gene expression domains, suggesting correct inference of the regulatory
parameters. In the presence of diffusion, the correspondence between velocity dxdtng and the
ON/OFF state of the gene will be violated for nuclei abutting gene expression domains due to
diffusion of protein from ON regions into OFF regions. The inferred parameters likely deviate
slightly from optimal values and were therefore refined using local search (Section 2.3.4).
Gene circuit simulation with refined parameters produces output that agrees very well with
the data and the√
output of gene circuits inferred using simulated annealing (Fig. 3D,E), and
has an RMS (χ/ n) of 13.29.
In the inferred network (Fig. 4), the gap genes are activated by Bcd and Cad, repress
each other, and autoactivate. The posterior gap genes are repressed by Tll. This scheme
is in good agreement with experimental evidence [18], the network inferred by simulated
annealing, and previous analyses [15, 24].
With compiled MATLAB code, FIGR with refinement takes 48 sec compared to 29,067 sec
taken by simulated annealing (∼600-fold speed up) to achieve the same RMS. In summary,
FIGR infers the gap gene network accurately but at a fraction of the computational expense.

Discussion and Conclusions

Gene circuits [15, 24, 31] provide many unique advantages for inferring and modeling gene
regulatory networks. Among higher-throughput statistical approaches for the inference of
GRNs, some, such as ARACNe [26] and Module Networks [33], are limited to the inference,
do not infer causality, and are incapable of predicting gene expression levels. Others, such
as Dynamic Bayesian Networks [20], although capable of simulation and prediction, rely on
the assumption that gene regulation by multiple TFs is additive and also cannot predict
gene expression at intermediate time points. In contrast, gene circuit equations are biologically realistic in representing gene regulation as a nonlinear switch-like function of TF
concentrations. Gene circuits not only infer the topology of the network but the directionality (causality) and sign of the edges. Most importantly, gene circuits are not limited to
inference but are capable of accurately simulating and predicting gene expression patterns.
Finally, the use of differential equations allows gene circuits to compute transient solutions,
an important factor in simulating development since fate determination can occur before
equilibrium is reached [25, 34].
Despite the promise held by gene circuits, their application, as of other nonlinear differential equation based models, has been limited to smaller networks so far. A major challenge
in broader adoption is the high computational expense of inferring the free parameters from
time series data. Currently, the approach for inferring parameter values [5, 31, 37] is to solve
(“integrate”) the ODEs to obtain trajectories, compare with experimental trajectories, and
refine parameters using global optimization techniques such as simulated annealing. This
procedure is slow and expensive because it requires performing multidimensional optimization on a complicated objective function χ2 ({T, h, R, λ}) with many local minima and each

function evaluation involves solving a system of ODEs. For instance, inferring a relatively
small 4-gene network takes 35 mins on 64 CPUs [37]. The computational complexity grows
as O(G3 ), since G ODEs are solved in each function evaluation and the number of objective
function evaluations required is proportional to the number of parameters (O(G2 )).
In contrast, FIGR directly attempts to fit the differential equations, which describe how
the velocities vg depend upon the positions xg . Tg and hg are determined using binary

classification (support vector machines or logistic regression). Both of these algorithms
reduce to quadratic programming, and thence to convex optimization. Subsequently, Rg
and λg can be determined by linear regression against velocities or non-linear regression
against concentrations using the piece-wise analytical solutions of the ODEs, which are even
simpler optimization problems. Each inference can be completed in a fraction of a second
on a consumer-grade computer, even with interpreted MATLAB code. We found that in
the gap gene circuit, the values of the regulatory parameters Tg and hg thus inferred were
consistent with those obtained by simulated annealing, and ODEs solved with the inferred
parameters produced gap gene domains correctly positioned in space and time. Furthermore,
the parameter values, which were inferred under the assumption of a Heaviside regulationexpression function, served as a good starting point for equations with a sigmoid regulationexpression function. Gene circuits with a good RMS could be obtained with an “off-the-shelf”
Nelder-Mead simplex method built into MATLAB. This refinement takes under a minute in
serial compared to the eight hours taken by simulated annealing. Finally, logistic regression
has a computational complexity of O(G), where G is the number of features (genes), which
implies that FIGR has a complexity of O(G2 ) when inferring G genes. Consequently, FIGR
scales with problem size much better than global nonlinear optimization techniques.
Besides the problem of computational efficiency, the broader application of gene circuits,
and indeed all nonlinear differential equation models, is limited by a lack of understanding of
parameter identifiability. Most commonly, a posteriori confidence intervals for the parameter
estimates are computed [2]. Such calculations are based on the strong assumption that the
solution is linear in the parameters and that the measurement errors are normally distributed.
a posteriori parameter identifiability analysis also does not provide any hints to improve
experimental design for achieving better identifiability in future studies.
Although we have not directly addressed the problem here, we anticipate that conceiving
of and visualizing gene circuit inference as a classification problem will lead to insights into
parameter identifiability. For example, it is evident from phase space plots (Fig. 1F,I) that
sampling gene expression trajectories closer to the true switching hyperplane of the gene
will lead to less “wiggle room” for the inferred hyperplane and result in more accurate
parameter inference. This implies that datasets that measure gene expression near steady
state, for example in differentiated cell types, are unlikely to lead to accurate parameter
inference irrespective of the number of data points sampled or the precision of the experiment.
Sampling transient trajectories densely when genes are turning ON or OFF is the best
strategy for accurate parameter inference. Another less obvious implication is that it is
easier to infer the regulation of negatively autoregulated genes than positively autoregulated
ones. Trajectories move toward or away from the switching hyperplane for negatively or
positively autoregulated genes respectively, making it more likely that sampled data points
will lie near the hyperplane in the former. This analysis will be reported elsewhere.
In summary, we have exploited features of the mathematical structure of the Glass model
to break a difficult optimization problem into a series of two, much simpler, optimization
problems. We have demonstrated that FIGR is effective on synthetic as well as experimental
data from a biologically realistic GRN. We have validated the inferred gap gene model by

and scalability should allow the inference of much larger GRNs than was possible previously.
