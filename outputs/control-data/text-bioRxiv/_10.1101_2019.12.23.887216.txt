Hydroxide Ion Carrier for Proton Pump in Bacteriorhodopsin:
Primary Proton Transfer

KEYWORDS: Photoreceptive proteins, Proton transport, Quantum molecular dynamics
ABSTRACT: Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) is a model protein for light-driven proton pumps, where the vectorial active proton transport results
in light-energy conversion. To clarify the microscopic mechanism of primary proton transfer from retinal Schiff base (SB) to Asp85 in BR,
herein we performed quantum-mechanical metadynamics simulations of the whole BR system (~3800 atoms). The simulations showed a
novel proton transfer mechanism, viz. hydroxide ion mechanism, in which the deprotonation of specific internal water (Wat452) yields the
protonation of Asp85 via Thr89, after which the resulting hydroxide ion accepts the remaining proton from retinal SB. Furthermore,
systematic investigations adopting four sequential snapshots obtained by the time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography revealed that
proton transfer took 2–5.25 μs on the photocycle. The presence of Wat401, which is the main difference between snapshots at 2 and 5.25 μs,
is found to be essential in assisting the primary proton transfer.
SIGNIFICANCE: Bacteriorhodopsin (BR), the benchmark of light-driven proton pumps, has attracted much attention from diverse areas
in terms of energy conversion. Despite the significant experimental and theoretical efforts, the microscopic mechanism of the proton
transfers in BR is not completely unveiled. In this study, quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations of whole BR system were
performed to elucidate the primary proton transfer in the L intermediate state with the latest snapshots obtained from X-ray free electron
laser. As a result, it is found that the hydroxide ion originating from the specific internal water, which appears at the active site only in the L
state, acts as a carrier for the primary proton transfer, demonstrating the importance of hydroxide ions in proton pumps.
1. INTRODUCTION
Proton transfer reactions play a vital role in various
biological phenomena as well as chemical events. For example,
the concentration gradient of protons across the membrane
generated by the active transport through proton pumps
becomes the driving force for adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
synthesis, thus indicating that the vectorial proton transfers
across the membrane help in energy conversion in biological
systems.1 A great deal of effort has been devoted to elucidating
the mechanism behind proton transfer reactions in biological
and chemical macromolecules. However, the microscopic
mechanism is still unclear due to the difficulties involved in
direct observation and analysis of the proton transfer reactions,
including the limitations imposed by high computational costs
of quantum-mechanical simulations of biomolecules, and
accurate measurements of the spatio-temporal resolution in
experiments.
Bacteriorhodopsin (BR), shown in Figure 1, is a typical
membrane protein that also functions as a proton pump.1-3
Recently, BR was adopted as a tool for efficient light-energy
conversion in artificial cells.4,5 BR is considered a benchmark
for microbial rhodopsins that have garnered attention from
various research fields, owing to the diversity in functionality
and applicability.6-9 For instance, part of microbial rhodopsins

have been successfully utilized as molecular tools for
controlling neuronal networks in optogenetics.10,11 In BR,
starting from the photo-isomerization of the retinal
chromophore12-16, which connects with Lys216 via the
protonated Schiff base (SB), at least five proton transfer
reactions successively take place on the photocycle, resulting in
net proton translocation from the cytoplasmic to extracellular
sides.1-3,17-27 In particular, the primary proton transfer occurring
in the L intermediate state from the protonated SB to Asp85 is
important, because it is the expected switching mechanism for
preventing the backflow of protons.22-25,27
In 2016, E. Nango et al. reported a molecular movie of
structural changes for BR along the photocycle captured by
time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography using an
X-ray free electron laser (XFEL).28 This state-of-the-art
technique is also utilized for capturing the molecular movie in
the initial photoisomerization process of BR.29,30 In addition,
time-resolved serial synchrotron crystallography has achieved
the visualization of the slow structural changes for BR in the
millisecond regime on the photocycle.31 These experimental
frameworks induce the paradigm shift in structural biology
from the conventional static pictures to the dynamical movies
for (at least) photoreceptive proteins.32

water molecules in the vicinity of the active site on the primary
proton transfer in BR, we performed DC-DFTB-MD and
metadynamics (metaD)51-54 simulations starting from four
snapshots along the L-to-M transition in the molecular movie28,
which are free from the radiation damages induced by x-ray,
followed by analysis of the free energy surfaces.
2. METHODS
For crystal structures of BR in the L intermediate state on
the photocycle, the four sequential snapshots obtained from
time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography based on
XFEL were employed; the PDB IDs (times from
photo-illumination) are 5B6X (760 ns), 5H2K (2 μs), 5H2L
(5.25 μs), and 5H2M (13.8 μs), respectively.28 From these four
snapshots, BR (the residues from 4 to 231), retinal, and internal
water molecules given in the individual crystal structures (the B
conformations) were extracted for constructing the isolated
models. The missing internal coordinates in the N terminus
(GLN1, ALA2, and GLN3) were added using the Swiss PDB
Viewer.55 The protonation states of the titratable amino acids
were evaluated at pH 7 with PROPKA56 implemented in the
PDB2PQR package57,58, and as a result, Asp96, Asp115, and
Glu194 were assigned to be protonated in these four structures,
which is consistent with the previous Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) experiments1. In addition, the retinal SB
was considered to be protonated in these four structures as the
initial states of the primary proton transfer from SB to Asp85.
The hydrogen atoms were added by the LEaP module in the
Amber14 software.59 The resulting number of atoms for the
isolated models (i.e., BR in vacuum) based on 5B6X, 5H2K,
5H2L, and 5H2M were 3748, 3748, 3745, 3742, respectively.
The positions of the complemented missing residues (the
residues from 1 to 3) and the hydrogen atoms in the systems
were first relaxed by energy minimization with the restraint of
the non-hydrogen atoms in the remaining residues within the
framework of the classical force fields. The minimization
process was conducted using the Sander module of Amber 1459,
with the Amber ff99SB-ILDN force field60 for the standard
amino acids, and TIP3P61 for the internal water molecules. The
parameters for the 13-cis retinal bound to Lys216 through SB
were generated with the RESP charges at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level and the general Amber force field (GAFF).62 The resulting
relaxed structures were used as the initial structures for the

The sequential 13 snapshots recorded by E. Nango et al.
during the transition from the resting state to M state showed
the functionally relevant conformational changes of BR,
including rearrangements of internal water molecules in the
active site and reorientational motions of the specific
residues.28 The appearance of the internal water molecule
(Wat452) exclusively in the L state (Figure 1b), the
disappearance of the internal water molecule (Wat401) between
2 and 5.25 μs (Figure 1d), and the change in orientation of the
Arg82 side chain between 5.25 and 13.8 μs (Figure 1e) are of
special interest. However, the hydrogen atoms and protons are
still invisible due to the restriction of spatial resolution (2.1
Å).28 Therefore, complementary approaches are expected to
reveal the remaining mysteries in the reaction mechanism of
proton transfers.
To this effect, a theoretical investigation based on
quantum-mechanical
molecular
dynamics
(QM-MD)
simulations is one of the more convenient approaches.
However, its application has been hampered by the so-called
exponential wall problem in QM-MD computations with
respect to the system size. Various efforts have been made to
solve this problem.33-35 Although one of the feasible approaches
might involve the first-principle simulations with pseudo
potential for core electrons and plane-wave basis for valence
electrons, the number of atoms that can be treated might be
fewer than 1000 for pico or sub-pico second simulations.36
Recently, the authors’ group enabled to perform QM-MD
simulations for thousands or tens of thousands of atoms by
utilizing three pillars: linear-scaling divide-and-conquer (DC)
technique, cost-effective semi-empirical density-functional
tight-binding (DFTB) method, and massively parallel
implementation with the hybrid of MPI and OpenMP.37 The
DC-DFTB-MD simulations were successful in describing
various chemical/physical phenomena in complex systems.38-48
The program system, DCDFTBMD49, has been distributed to the
academic community through a special web site.50
In this study, we applied the DC-DFTB-MD method to
examine the primary proton transfer in BR, in which the proton
is transferred from the protonated SB to Asp85 during the
L-to-M transition. This is the key step in achieving
unidirectional active proton translocation. To elucidate the
detailed pathway, timing, and the roles of residues and internal

where qNζ, qCε, and qC15 denote the charge of the N atom on SB,
that of the Cε atom in Lys216, and that of the C15 atom in
retinal, respectively. Similarly, the charge fluctuation of Asp85
qD85 is defined as
qD85 = 0.75 qOδ1 + 0.55 qOδ2 – 0.35 qCγ
(2)
where qOδ1, qOδ2, and qCγ indicate the charge of the Oδ atom in
Asp85 forming hydrogen bond with Thr89, that of the
remaining Oδ atom in Asp85, and the Cγ atom in Asp85,
respectively. Note that these coefficients were determined from
the principal component analysis for the time series of the
charges. The weighted 2D histograms for qSB and qD85 were
calculated from multiple biased trajectories using the
reweighting method,71 and the resulting histograms were
statistically averaged with weighted histogram analysis method
(WHAM).72 After equilibration with DC-DFTB-MD, at least 5
biased trajectories with different initial structures and velocities
were generated from DC-DFTB-WTmetaD for more than 50 ps
during which the 2D FES for the charge fluctuations qSB and
qD85 were calculated.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
First, we performed the DC-DFTB-metaD simulations
biasing the deprotonation of SB: i.e., 1D metaD with a single
CV. This is based on the assumption that deprotonation initiates
the primary proton transfer as examined in the previous
studies.22-25 We then obtained 17 proton transfer trajectories
from SB to Asp85 by using the 5H2K structure, which were
categorized into two parts. One is a two-step proton transfer
pathway, denoted as path 1, in which the proton migration
occurs from SB to the hydroxy group in the side chain of Thr89,
followed by the proton transfer from Thr89 to Asp85 (Figure
2a). Path 1 was observed in 8 out of 17 metaD trajectories. This
pathway was proposed by the NMR study.27 The other is a
three-step proton transfer pathway, denoted as path 2, where the
protonation of Wat452 is first induced by the deprotonation of
SB, and then the proton is transferred from Wat452 through
Thr89 to Asp85 (Figure 2b). Here, Wat452 plays a key role in
the initial proton transfer by producing hydronium ion (H3O+),
followed by deprotonation, which corresponds to the standard
Grotthuss hopping.73 Path 2 was observed in 9 out of 17 metaD
trajectories. This pathway was proposed by the XFEL study.28
The structural condition that brought about path 2 might be the
formation of simultaneous short-range hydrogen bonds from
SB to Asp85 through Wat452. The detailed analysis is given in
Figures S1 and S2 in the supporting information (SI).
Figures 3a and 3b show the 2D FESs for two paths 1 and
2, both of which were obtained from the DC-DFTB-metaD
simulations using the 5H2K structure. Here, the horizontal and
vertical axes represent the charge fluctuations of SB and Asp85,
qSB and qD85, respectively. These values are recognized as the
order parameters of the protonation states for SB and Asp85.
The free energy minimum located at {qSB, qD85} ≃ {0.1, -1.3}
corresponds to the initial state (i.e., protonated SB and
deprotonated Asp85), whereas the one located at {qSB, qD85} ≃
{0.4, -1.0} corresponds to the final state (i.e., deprotonated SB
and protonated Asp85). The intermediate state (i.e.,
deprotonated SB and deprotonated Asp85) is located at around
{0.4, -1.3}, and represents protonated Thr89 in paths 1 and 2,
as well as the hydronium ion of Wat452 in path 2. The free
energy barriers from the initial to final states, ΔG‡, of paths 1
and 2 were estimated to be 59 and 58 kcal/mol, respectively.
From the timescale of the L state, i.e., the order of
microseconds,1 the barrier can be estimated to be
approximately 10 kcal/mol using the transition state theory.
Therefore, the present estimations of ΔG‡ of paths 1 and 2 are
significantly higher than the previous theoretical values.22-25

DC-DFTB-MD simulations, in which all the atoms
(approximately 3,800 atoms) were treated quantum
mechanically without any restraints.
The DC-DFTB-MD simulations were performed for the
equilibration and production runs of the systems using the
DCDFTBMD program.49 The DFTB3 method was employed
with the 3OB parameter set.63-65 Grimme’s DFT-D3 dispersion
correction with the Becke-Johnson damping scheme was
adopted.66,67 The DC method with 4 × 4 × 4 Å3 cubic grids,
resulting in ca. 660 subsystems, and the buffer radius of 5 Å
was employed to reduce the computational costs. The unbiased
DC-DFTB-MD simulations starting from the above-mentioned
structures were carried out for 50 ps under the NVT ensemble
(T = 298.15 K) controlled by the Andersen thermostat.68 Here,
the velocity Verlet integrator with a time step of 0.5 fs was
utilized for the time integration. From the 50-ps DC-DFTB-MD
simulations for equilibrating the systems, no proton transfers
were actually observed. The structural analyses such as the
probability distribution functions for the hydrogen-bond
distances and angles in the active site were performed on the
basis of the last 10-ps trajectories.
The free energy surfaces (FESs) for the primary proton
transfer in BR were evaluated using the DC-DFTB-metaD
simulations.49 In the present study, the well-tempered
metadynamics (WTmetaD)52 was employed to accelerate the
deprotonation event of the protonated SB. As the collective
variable (CV) of one-dimensional (1D) WTmetaD
characterizing the dissociation event of the protonated SB, the
effective coordination number for the N atom on SB with
respect to proton was selected, which is defined as the rational
form as a function of the distance between N and H atoms of
SB with the cutoff distance of 1.6 Å.49 The initial height of the
Gaussian function for the biasing potential was set to 1.88
kcal/mol. Note that this value of the initial Gaussian height was
actually
employed
in
the
previous
quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) metaD
simulations for biomolecular systems.69 The width of the
Gaussian function was set to 0.02. This value corresponds to
the standard deviation of CV obtained from unbiased MD
simulations in the initial state of the primary proton transfer.53
The Gaussian biasing potential was deposited at the time
interval of 20 fs, which is estimated from the initial decay of
the autocorrelation function for CV in the unbiased MD
simulations.53 The bias factor of WTmetaD was set to 31
corresponding to the bias temperature of 9000 K.
The two-dimensional (2D) WTmetaD were performed to
confirm whether the protonation change of the internal water
molecule in the cytoplasmic side of the active site (Wat452)
occurs before the deprotonation of SB. In addition to the
coordination number for the N atom on SB employed in the 1D
WTmetaD, that for the O atom on Wat452 with the cutoff
distance of 1.4 Å was adopted as the alternate CV in the 2D
WTmetaD. The parameters for the 2D WTmetaD were
identical with those for the 1D WTmetaD.
To characterize the proton transfer reaction
unambiguously, 2D FESs for the charge fluctuations of the
donor (SB) and acceptor (Asp85), instead of the corresponding
coordination numbers, were calculated. Note that recently the
charge fluctuation is proposed as the efficient CV for the FESs
of chemical reactions by performing the coupled-perturbed
DFTB-metaD simulation.70 In this study, the reweighting
method for WTmetaD71 was employed to obtain the 2D FESs
for the charge fluctuations from the DC-DFTB-metaD with the
CV(s) of the coordination number(s). Here, the charge
fluctuation of SB qSB is defined as
(1)
qSB = –0.94 qNζ + 0.26 qCε + 0.21 qC15

intervals of 100 fs were superimposed. The arrows and numbers indicate the direction and order of the proton transfers, respectively.
the initial to final states ΔG‡ in path 3 was estimated to be 29
kcal/mol, which was slightly higher than those in the previous
QM/MM studies22-25 based on SCC-DFTB with crystal
structures including x-ray-induced radiation damages28, but
significantly lower than those in paths 1 and 2. Therefore, the
present simulations indicate that the hydroxide ion mechanism
is the most favorable from an energetic standpoint.

Next, we performed the DC-DFTB-metaD simulations
with the biases for coordination numbers of SB and Wat452;
i.e., 2D metaD with two CVs. It is notable that the simulations
did not assume that the deprotonation of SB precedes the other
protonation changes in the active site. From the simulations
with the 5B6X and 5H2K structures, we obtained another
three-step proton transfer pathway, denoted as path 3, in which
the deprotonation of Wat452 gives rise to the protonation of
Asp85 via Thr89, followed by the reprotonation of the resultant
hydroxide ion of Wat452 from SB (Figure 2c). Because the
hydroxide ion (OH-) of Wat452 plays a key role in this pathway,
we termed this as the hydroxide ion mechanism. Note that in
contrast to the above-mentioned paths 1 and 2, the hydroxide
ion mechanism via path 3 had not been discovered so far, to the
best of our knowledge. The structural analysis in path 3, as
shown in Figure S3 in the SI, clarified that short-range
hydrogen bonds related with Wat452 switches stepwise from
Thr89-water to SB-hydroxide ion, which might be caused by
the higher mobility of Wat452. We speculate that this stepwise
switching of the hydrogen bond might be the origin of the
irreversible proton transfer.
Figure 3c shows the 2D FES for path 3 obtained from the
DC-DFTB-metaD simulations with the 5H2K structure. The
free energy minima corresponding to the initial and final states
in path 3 are the same as those in paths 1 and 2. The local
minimum located at {qSB, qD85} ≃ {0.1, -1.0} indicates the
intermediate state (i.e., protonated SB and protonated Asp85)
with the hydroxide ion of Wat452. The free energy barrier from

Table 1 summarizes the free energy barriers ΔG‡ of the

transfer via path 3 was not obtained from the 2D metaD
simulations. Instead, the irrelevant proton transfer from Wat452
to the backbone carbonyl group of Thr89 was observed, as
shown in Figure S4. The value of ΔG‡ in path 3 for 5H2K was
the lowest among the three pathways and four L-state structures,
indicating that the primary proton transfer takes place from
5H2K (2 μs) to 5H2L (5.25 μs) on the photoreaction cycle in
BR.

occurs prior to the other protonation changes, two pathways
(paths 1 and 2) were observed, as predicted in the previous
studies.22-25,27,28 However, free energy barriers of both pathways
were estimated to be significantly higher. In contrast, from the
2D metaD simulations biasing the protonation changes of both
SB and Wat452, a hitherto unknown pathway (path 3) was
observed. In this pathway, Wat452 initially donates the proton
to Asp85 via Thr89, and subsequently the resulting hydroxide
ion receives the proton from SB. Here, Wat452 was expected to
serve as the switch from Thr89 to SB of the short-range
hydrogen bonds required in the transition states of the proton
transfers, which could be biologically relevant to the
unidirectional proton transfers as the proton pump. From
energetic and structural viewpoints, the present results
confirmed that the primary proton transfer occurs from 5H2K
(2 μs) to 5H2L (5.25 μs) via path 3, which we call the
hydroxide ion mechanism. After the primary proton transfer,
Wat401 disappears from the extracellular side of the active site,
which destabilizes the hydrogen bond between Wat452 and
Thr89 and further discourages the reverse reaction. Finally, the
downward orientation of Arg82 promotes the next proton
transfer process, i.e., the release of the proton into the
extracellular medium73-78, and the subsequent reprotonation of
SB from Asp96 on the cytoplasmic side.79-81

Finally, we examined the differences in the four L-states
(5B6X, 5H2K, 5H2L, and 5H2M) from a structural viewpoint.
In the hydroxide ion mechanism via path 3, the hydrogen bond
between Wat452 and the side-chain hydroxy group of Thr89
should be essential for the initial deprotonation of Wat452.
Figures 4a-d show the 2D probability distribution functions for
the hydrogen-bond distance, r(O...O), and the hydrogen-bond
angle, θ(O-H...O), which were evaluated by using the results of
DC-DFTB-MD simulations with the 5B6X, 5H2K, 5H2L, and
5H2M structures at the equilibrium condition. In the 5B6X and
5H2K structures the peaks of the probability distributions were
located at {r, θ} = {2.7 Å, 160°}, whereas in the 5H2L and
5H2M structures the peaks were at {3.9 Å, 90°}. These results
indicate that the hydrogen bond between Wat452 and Thr89 in
5B6X/5H2K was favorably formed, while that in 5H2L/5H2M
was broken; in the latter case, Wat452 formed the hydrogen
bond with the main-chain carbonyl group of Thr89. Note that
there are no significant differences in the other hydrogen bonds
connecting SB and Asp85 in the active site amongst the four
structures under discussion (Figures S5, S6, and S7).

One of the prominent differences between 5B6X/5H2K
and 5H2L/5H2M is the number of internal water molecules in
the extracellular side of the active site: two and one,
respectively (Figure 1). To clarify the role of Wat401, we
performed the DC-DFTB-MD simulation with the 5H2K
structure by artificially eliminating Wat401. The 2D probability
distribution function for the hydrogen-bond distance and angle
obtained from the simulation closely resembled that in
5H2L/5H2M (Figure S8). Therefore, Wat401 was found to
assist the initial proton transfer in path 3 by stabilizing the
hydrogen bond between Wat452 and Thr89.
