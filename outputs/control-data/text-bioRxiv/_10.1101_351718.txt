anticipated. However, very few experimental evolutionary studies have convincingly

22

demonstrated the evolution of reproductive isolation due to sexual conflict. Recently a study

23

on the replicates of Drosophila melanogaster populations under differential sexual conflict

24

found that divergent mate preference evolved among replicates under high sexual conflict

25

regime. The precopulatory isolating mechanism underlying such divergent mate preference

26

could be sexual signals such as cuticular lipids since they evolve rapidly and are involved in

27

D. melanogaster mate recognition. Using Drosophila melanogaster replicates used in the

28

previous study, we investigate whether cuticular lipid divergence bears signatures of sexually

29

antagonistic coevolution that led to reproductive isolation among replicates of high sexual

30

conflict regime. We found that their cuticular lipid profiles are sexually dimorphic. Although

31

replicates with male biased sex ratio evolved isolation in reproductive traits due to high sexual

32

conflict, the patterns of cuticular lipid divergence in high and low sexual conflict regimes

33

suggest that sexual selection is the dominant selection pressure rather than sexual conflict

34

affecting the cuticular lipid profile. We also find cuticular lipid divergence patterns to be

35

suggestive of the Buridan’s Ass regime which is one of the six possible mechanism to resolve

36

sexual conflict. Although both sexes of male biased replicates have divergent cuticular lipid

37

profiles, isolation of male biased replicates as a result of cuticular lipid divergence cannot be

38

credited to sexually antagonistic coevolution.

The ability of sexual conflict to facilitate reproductive isolation is widely

INTRODUCTION

42
43

Mathematical models of sexual conflict based on mating rate envisage six possible

44

evolutionary outcomes out of which two lead to speciation: allopatric speciation as a

45

byproduct of sexually antagonistic coevolution (SAC) and sympatric speciation as a

46

byproduct of divergence in the reproductive traits of females followed by the male sex

47

(Gavrilets and Hayashi 2005). A comparative study on groups of insect species has shown

48

that the prevalence of high sexual conflict makes a taxonomic group more speciose than

49

those with low or no sexual conflict (Arnqvist et al. 2000). However, the support for

50

speciation through sexual conflict is not universal and comparative studies on other groups of

51

species have not found a similar trend (Gage et al. 2002, Morrow et al. 2003). Experimental

52

studies that directly investigate speciation linked to sexual conflict too are inconsistent in

53

their support for the hypothesis presumably due to the occurrence of four other possible

54

dynamic outcomes predicted in the mathematical models that do not result in speciation

55

(Gavrilets 2014).

56

By evolving independent replicates of a dung fly population for 35 generations under

57

monogamous (low) and polygamous (high) sexual conflict) regime, Martin and Hosken

58

(2003) showed that mating success between individuals of the same population was

59

significantly higher than that of pairs consisting of males and females from different

60

populations under polygamous regime. In the monogamous regime, there was no difference

61

in mating success between individuals from hetero-population and same population.

62

Recently, a study on Drosophila melanogaster populations using male biased (high sexual

63

conflict) and female biased (low sexual conflict) operational sex ratio regimes showed that

64

evolution of both premating and post mating prezygotic isolation was possible within 105

65

generations in the high sexual conflict regime but not in the low sexual conflict regime (Syed

66

et al. 2017). Contrary to these two studies, few other studies were unable to find any support

67

for sexual conflict driven reproductive isolation leading us to question the potential of sexual

68

conflict as an “engine of speciation” (Gage et al. 2002, Morrow et al. 2003, Bacigalupe et al.

69

2007, Gay et al. 2009, Plesnar-Bielak et al. 2013).

70

Syed et al. (2017) indicate that the differences in mate preference among replicate male

71

biased (3 male : 1 female sex ratio) Drosophila melanogaster populations arise due to

72

sexually antagonistic coevolution. Prezygotic isolation by mate preference is often mediated

73

by cuticular lipid profiles that provide information about species identity, sex, mating status,

74

age, etc. to a receiver and play a pivotal role in sexual communication in Drosophila sp.

75

(Ferveur et al. 1989, Ferveur 1997, Ferveur and Cobb 2010). It is, therefore, possible that the

76

cuticular lipid profiles form the mechanistic basis for mate preference among replicate male

77

biased populations in D. melanogaster studied by Syed et al. (2017). However, this

78

possibility assumes that the cuticular lipid profiles have also differentiated among replicates

79

as a byproduct of sexual conflict within each allopatric replicate. Cuticular lipid profiles of

80

Drosophila melanogaster are dimorphic (Ferveur and Cobb 2010) and those cuticular lipids

81

that take part in mate preference are known to have independent genetic controls in the two

82

sexes, often linked to sex determination genes, for their biosynthesis (Ferveur 2005,

83

Chenoweth et al. 2008, Dembeck et al. 2015). This is a possible signature of past sexually

84

antagonistic selection (Cox and Calsbeek 2009) and current interlocus sexual conflict. Many

85

previous studies have implicated differentiated cuticular lipid profiles in the evolution of

86

reproductive isolation in Drosophila sp. through sexual selection (Smadja and Butlin 2008,

87

Laturney 2012, Shahandeh et al. 2017) but in this study we look into the possibility of

88

cuticular lipid divergence under differential sexual conflict.

89

We test the hypothesis that cuticular lipid profiles (that play a role in mate attraction) are

90

differentiated in conjunction with the differentiation in mate preference by sexual conflict.

91

Using the same D. melanogaster populations as Syed et al. (2017), we investigate the patterns

92

of cuticular lipid divergence among the replicates of male and female biased regimes. We

93

expect all D. melanogaster populations to show sexual dimorphism in cuticular lipid profiles.

94

We predict that due to high sexual conflict the male cuticular lipid profiles of male biased (3

95

male : 1 female) replicates will diverge more than the male cuticular lipid profiles of the

96

female biased (1 male : 3 female) populations. Our result suggests that reproductive isolation

97

among M replicates due to high sexual conflict is not explained by the patterns of cuticular

98

lipid divergence. Instead we find other evolutionary mechanisms that are contributing to

99

cuticular lipid divergence.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
D. melanogaster population maintenance. In this study, we used nine populations

103

of Drosophila melanogaster belonging to 168-170 generation raised under three different

104

selection regimes. These three selection regimes were identical in all respect, except for the

105

adult sex-ratio. The male biased regime (henceforth M) had a 1:3 :: female:male adult sex

106

ratio, while the female biased regime (henceforth F) had a 3:1 :: female:male adult sex ratio.

107

The control regime (henceforth C) had a 1:1 adult sex ratio. Each regime had three replicate

108

populations (M1,2,3 in the M regime, F1,2,3 in the F regime and C1,2,3 in the C regime). All

109

nine populations ultimately trace their ancestry to a large, laboratory adapted population,

110

LHst which has an autosomal, recessive scarlet eye-colour marker. We first derived three

111

populations from the LHst population and labeled them C1,2,3. The C1,2,3 populations were

112

maintained at a 1:1 adult sex ratio for five generations. Subsequently, from each C

113

population, we derived one population for the M regime, one for the F regime and one for the

114

C regime. M, C and F populations with the same subscript were derived from the same C

115

population and therefore are closely related in terms of ancestry. For example, M1, F1 and

116

C1 were derived from C1. Moreover, during subsequent population maintenance, M, C and F

117

populations with the same subscript are handled on the same day and therefore can be treated

118

as statistical blocks. The details of maintenance of M, C and F populations have been

119

described elsewhere(Nandy et al. 2013a). Briefly, these populations are maintained on a 14-

120

day discrete generation cycle, at 25˚C and 60% relative humidity (RH), 12:12 hours

121

light/dark cycle and standard cornmeal– molasses–yeast food in standard vials (90-mm length

122

× 30-mm diameter). In each regime, every generation we collect virgin males and females

123

and combine them in appropriate sex ratios. Males and females interact for around 48 hours,

124

after which they are transferred to fresh vials for oviposition. Eggs laid are trimmed to a

125

density of around 140-160 eggs per vial containing 6-8 ml food. These eggs are used to start

126

the next generation.

127

Generating flies for cuticular lipid extraction. Before cuticular lipid extraction

128

from virgin M, C, and F flies, we allowed one generation of “standardization” or common-

129

garden rearing at a 1:1 sex ratio following Nandy et al. (2013a) to account for any potential

130

non-genetic parental effect (Rose 1984). In order to generate flies for cuticular lipid

131

extraction, we collected eggs from “standardised” flies. On the 10th day after egg collection

132

from the M, C, and F populations, we collected newly eclosed flies as virgins within 6 hours

133

of eclosion under light CO2 anesthesia. The flies were isolated by keeping each of them

134

singly in a vial for 2 days. On 12th day (ensuring flies of same age to minimize age-specific

135

variation of cuticular lipids) the cuticular lipids extraction assay was conducted.

136

Cuticular lipid extraction. We transferred each virgin individual to a 1.5 ml gas

137

chromatography (GC) vial without anesthetising it. We then poured a 200 µl Hexane solvent

138

containing 10ng/µl Pentadecane (C15H32, internal standard) into the GC vials. The vials

139

were left undisturbed for 4 minutes and then vortexed for 1 minute. We removed the dead

140

individual from each GC vial and subsequently left the hexane to dry out. The extracted

141

samples in the GC vials were then stored at 4˚C until gas chromatography was performed.

142

Cuticular lipids were extracted from the male and female D. melanogaster flies belonging to

143

all blocks of MCF population [n for M = 119 (60 males + 59 females), n for F = 115 (58

144

males + 57 females) and n for C = 118 (59 males + 59 females)].

145

Gas chromatography. Before gas chromatography, the dried extract adhering to the

146

glass GC vials was brought to solution by pipetting 20 µl Hexane and vortexed for 30 sec.

147

We injected 2µl of this solution manually into splitless Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus instrument

fitted with a Restek Rxi-5Sil MS (30m x 0.25µm df x 0.25mm ID) capillary column. The

149

24.88 minutes’ temperature program was set to increase from initial 57˚C held for 1.1

150

minutes to 190˚C held for 1.2 minutes at 100˚C per minute. The temperature increased from

151

190˚C to 270˚C at 5˚C per minute and finally raised to 300˚C at 120˚C per minute with hold

152

time of 5 minutes at 300˚C (Bedhomme et al. 2011). The carrier gas was Nitrogen with

153

column flow rate fixed at 2ml per minute.

154

Cuticular lipid identification. Before gas chromatography of D. melanogaster

155

samples, a chromatographic run was performed with a mix of known straight chained alkane

156

standards (C10 to C40) increasing in even numbers of Carbon. This chromatogram was used to

157

measure Kovats Retention Index (KI) for all relevant unknown sample peaks by referring to

158

retention time for internal standard (Pentadecane: C15) and hydrocarbon compounds in the

159

standard mix. The KI was used to identify cuticular lipid peaks based on already published

160

KIs of cuticular lipids (using similar method followed by Bedhomme et al. (2011)).

161

Cuticular lipid quantification. All peaks that consistently appeared in the samples

162

when compared with a blank chromatographic run (using Hexane that was used in the

163

extraction process) were considered relevant to this study. The area under the peak value was

164

calculated by drawing a baseline to each relevant peak using the Shimadzu GCSolutions

165

software. We manually checked the integrated peaks in all the sample chromatograms for any

166

irregularities. The peak areas of the 352 samples was standardized by dividing the peak value

167

with that of internal standard (Pentadecane) from respective chromatograms following

168

Bedhomme et al. (2011). Each standardized value was then multiplied by 105 to enable us to

169

use more significant figures in multivariate analysis. While standardization using internal

170

standard allow us to minimise any handling effect during gas chromatography performed

171

over many days, we further normalized the standardized peak values of all samples to reduce

172

any handling effect that may have cropped up during extraction process. Extractions were

173

performed on three different days for three different blocks of M, C and F. This entire

174

exercise was repeated at two different times. We use the following min-max feature scaling

175
176

formula for normalizing cuticular lipid peak values: 𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋 =

177

group and Xmin is the minimum peak value within a group. However, we also ran Random

178

Forest analysis (see below) with non-normalised data to examine whether any effect of

179

procuring samples at different times affected the cuticular lipid divergence pattern. We find

180

that cuticular lipid divergence pattern is qualitatively similar for both normalized and non-

181

normalised data. We use divergence pattern from normalized data in this study while

182

corresponding cuticular lipid divergence pattern from non-normalised data is presented as

183

supplementary information (see Supplementary Information).

where Xnew is the

Linear mixed effects analysis. To quantify whether variables such as selection

185

regimes, sex, replicates and their interactions explain the distribution of the peak values of

186

each cuticular lipid, we used linear models for mixed effects analysis. Following Bedhomme

187

et al. (2011), selection regime (M, C and F), sex (male and female) and their interaction were

188

considered explanatory variables with fixed effects while replicates within each selection

189

regimes (block 1, 2, and 3) and its interactions with explanatory variables were assigned as

190

variables with random effects. Although each individual within blocks were unique, block

191

themselves were nested within each selection regime. Additionally, the same subscript in

192

block identity from different selection regime denoted common ancestry. A common ancestry

193

has the possibility of confounding the independence of cuticular lipid profiles of the studied

194

Drosophila individuals stochastically since these populations have evolved for around 170

195

generations, making it necessary to consider block identity as random effect. Therefore, using

196

normalized peak values as response variables in this analysis, we modelled the fixed and

197

random effects on the response variables according to the following two formula:

198

Model 1 = Selection regime + Sex + (Selection regime x Sex) + Block

199

Model 2 = Selection regime + Sex + (Selection regime x Sex) + Block + (Selection

200
201

regime x Block) + (Block x Sex) + (Selection regime x Block x Sex)
While Model 1 represents a simpler model out of the two models containing all variables

202

with fixed effects and only block identity having random effect, Model 2 incorporates all

203

biologically relevant explanatory variables with fixed and random effects. We used “lme4”

204

package in R and selected a model out of the two aforementioned models for each cuticular

205

lipid that had a lower Akike Information Criterion (AIC). Linear mixed effects analysis

206

explains how different variables recorded during sampling from the D. melanogaster

207

populations affect each cuticular lipid individually. However, to further understand how the

208

combinations of all cuticular lipids determine grouping of Drosophila M, C and F

209

populations, we used Random Forest based multivariate analysis.

210

Random Forest analysis. Multivariate analysis like principal component analysis and

211

discriminant function analysis are generally used in studies that investigates group patterns

212

within samples based on cuticular profiles (Kather and Martin 2012). However, these

213

statistical techniques are adversely impacted by small sample-size(n):variables(p), non-

214

independence of cuticular lipids in a sample (since many cuticular lipids share common

215

biochemical pathways (Dembeck et al. 2015)) and disproportionate effects of cuticular lipids

216

found in trace amounts (Martin and Drijfhout 2009). To overcome this drawbacks of

217

traditional techniques, we used Random Forest analysis (R package “Party”) that performs

218

well under “small n large p” conditions, unaffected by highly correlated variables and is

219

unbiased towards the nature of variables used (Strobl et al. 2009b, 2009a). Random Forest

220

Analysis is a machine learning algorithm that forms numerous classification schemes without

221

prior expectation of the data structure by repeated subsampling of the data and random

222

selection of a few predictor variables (Strobl et al. 2009b). Using these classification schemes

223

(also called base learners), individuals are reassigned their identity based on their probability

224

to appear as a particular group in the base learners. When these new identities of the samples

225

are compared to their already known group identity, we calculate the percentage correct

226

prediction of individual identities from Random Forest analysis. Based on the probabilities of

227

individual identities, proximity analysis (identical to similarity-dissimilarity matrix/

228

correlation matrix in traditional multivariate analysis) gives us a measure of samples’ group

229

affinity. Multidimensional scaling (identical to Principal Component Analysis) of the

230

proximity matrix is then illustrated in a scatterplot to show how experimental individuals

231

group with respect to each other.

232

We performed Random Forest analysis using normalized and standardised area under the

233

peak values of all relevant peaks. Seed (a random number) was set to 1220. We checked the

234

stability of the classification scheme by increasing the number of subsampling events

235

gradually from 5000 to 20000 and decided to set the number of trees (ntree) parameter in the

236

analysis at 15000. The number of variables (mtry = 6) to be used in the analysis was fixed to

237

rounded square root of the number of predictor variables (in the present study, the number of

238

peaks analysed in chromatograms) in the data (Strobl et al. 2009b). Multi-dimensional

239

scaling (MDS) of proximity matrix was used to produce two dimensional scatterplots

240

showing clustering of individuals.

RESULTS

242

Characterisation of cuticular lipids in D. melanogaster populations under

243

differential sexual conflict. We found a total of 44 peaks that consistently appeared in

244

MCF chromatograms. Out of the 44 peaks, 37 were cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), 3

245

belonged to other chemical groups found on insect cuticle and 4 could not be identified. We

246

also found 14 new peaks that have not been reported for Drosophila melanogaster in

247

literature before. Most of the CHCs had hydrocarbons chain lengths between C20 and C30 (see

248

Supplementary Information). Male and female chromatographic profiles significantly

249

differed in relative abundance of 35 peaks out of the 44 identified peaks based on Welch two

250

sample T test (p<0.05). The 9 cuticular lipids which occur in similar quantities in both males

251

and females are most likely involved in primary anti-dessication function of cuticular lipids.

252

Drosophila melanogaster males predominantly produce monoenes (e.g. Tricosene,

253

Pentacosene, etc) while their females predominantly produce dienes (e.g. Heptacosadiene,

254

Nonacosadiene, etc.) (Ferveur and Cobb 2010). Among the dimorphic cuticular lipids (see

255

Supplementary Information), we found that the D. melanogaster males produced few

256

monoenes (peak 7, 8, 15, 16, 19 and 43) significantly more than the females. Peak 19 (a

257

Pentacosene isomer) that is always present in males was totally absent in females indicating a

258

likely sex specific role. However, we also found certain monoenes (peak 20, 21, 25, 26, 27,

259

28 and 30) to be significantly more in the females than males. The D. melanogaster females

260

almost always produced significantly more dienes (peak 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 41) than

261

the males in our study (only exception being peak 14/ (Z,Z)-7,11-Tricosadiene). In our D.

262

melanogaster populations, Peak 33 (9,13-Heptacosadiene) was generally absent from male

263

chromatograms but were found in most females. Apart from Peak 19 and Peak 33, all other

264

peaks appeared consistently in all female samples while except Peak 33 and Peak 39 (14-

Effects of selection regime, sex and replicate on the cuticular lipids of D.

268

melanogaster populations under differential sexual conflict. We considered 37

269

peaks out of 44 cuticular lipids for the linear mixed effects analysis. Peak 15, 25-29 and 42

270

were ambiguous since they often appeared as more than one peak within their retention time

271

in many samples. We assigned Model 1 for most cuticular lipids while 6 cuticular lipids were

272

assigned Model 2 as the best fit model based on the lower AIC value. Even in case of these 6

273

cuticular lipids, Model 2 outperformed Model 1 on a thin difference of AIC varying between

274

0.008-4.38 (exception being Peak 36: difference in AIC between Model 1 and Model 2 was

275

28.52). This indicates that variables with random effects played an insignificant role in

276

influencing the cuticular lipid profiles of D. melanogaster M, C and F populations. When we

277

compared the standard deviation of variable(s) with random effects to that of the residual for

278

each peak (that were in itself close to 0 in all cases), we found that the standard deviation of

279

residual was always more (in many cases, order of magnitude more) than the standard

280

deviation of variable(s) with random effects for all peaks under consideration (see

281

Supplementary Information for detailed results). This means block or its interactions are not

282

substantial than other unaccounted random effects and confirms that there is no effect of

283

common ancestry of the replicates of the selection lines on the cuticular lipid profiles of the

284

M, C and F populations. The sex of the sampled D. melanogaster individuals is the most

285

important variable affecting the cuticular lipid profiles of the M, C and F populations (see

286

Table 1) as is seen in the T test (see Supplementary Information). The variables with fixed

287

effects such as selection regime and its interaction with sex of the individuals also affect a

288

few cuticular lipids (see Table 1). Only two cuticular lipids (Peak 2 and Peak 10) are not

289

affected by any of the explanatory variables. Since this test failed to give us any indication

Drosophila M-C-F populations under linear mixed effect modelling framework. Model with

313

note that the triplicates of C are maintained at unit sex ratio and are derived from LHst while

314

M and F populations are derived from the C replicates (see Methods section for details).

Therefore, the divergence pattern of C in Fig. 1 (see Supplementary Information for 3D

reference pattern to M and F populations. The cuticular lipid divergence pattern in Fig. 2 (see

318

Supplementary Information for 3D representation) suggests that the M females are more

319

dispersed than the M males that are tightly grouped (95 % correct identification of M

320

individuals from 3 replicate populations). In comparison to C population, M males appear to

321

have evolved cuticular lipid profiles which are more similar to each other while M females

322

have either evolved a more variable cuticular lipid profile or maintained their cuticular lipid

323

profile variability as seen in C females. In F population (Fig. 3 (see Supplementary

324

Information for 3D representation)), we see an opposite trend where the F males are

325

dispersed more than the F females that form tight group (93 % correct identification of F

326

individuals belonging to 3 replicate populations). Comparison with C females suggests that F

327

females have evolved identical cuticular lipid profiles while F males have either increased or

328

maintained their variable cuticular lipid profile as seen in C males. Corresponding 3-

dimensional scatterplot representations for Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are provided in the

When we compare male cuticular lipid profile of M and F replicates, Random Forest analysis

336

of M replicates formed separate groups with few overlaps among themselves. However, F

337

replicates did not group separately from the M replicates as expected but overlapped with

corresponding M replicates. In Random Forest analysis involving females of M and F

DISCUSSION

346

Divergent reproductive behavior in high sexual conflict regimes of allopatric MCF populations

347

evolved over 105 generations as a byproduct of sexually antagonistic coevolution within each

348

M replicates (Syed et al. 2017). Since reproductive behavior did not diverge in F replicates

349

under low sexual conflict, we predicted that male and female cuticular lipid profiles of the three

350

replicates within the M regime should be more divergent from each other compared to the

351

differences in the cuticular lipid profiles of the three replicates within the F regime (assuming

352

the putative chemical cues such as the cuticular lipids form the basis of divergent mate choice

353

in M). Random Forest analysis (see Fig. 4) shows that the three replicates of M males form 3

354

distinct groups but contrary to our prediction, F males do not form a single group. Instead, the

355

three F replicates overlap with the three corresponding M replicates. The same divergence

356

pattern is also reflected in the females of M and F replicates (see Fig. 5). Such cuticular lipid

357

divergence pattern indicates that sexual conflict has little or no role in reproductive isolation

358

via male cuticular lipid differentiation within M and F regimes that have been under high and

359

low sexual conflict, respectively, for around 170 generations at the time of this study. Rather

360

the cuticular lipid divergence in M and F regime appears to follow an inexplicable pattern.

361

There are two possible reasons for the block-wise cuticular lipid divergence pattern that we see

362

in the replicates of M and F sexes. The cuticular lipid divergence pattern of M and F males and

363

females (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) may be construed as a result of handling effect since extraction

364

process spanned over three days (for three blocks) and repeated at two different times (see

365

Methods section for details). Using Random Forest analysis on normalized and non-normalised

366

data, we tried to address this issue. However, congruence in cuticular lipid divergence patterns

367

from these two treatments of cuticular lipid peak values (see Supplementary Information for

368

cuticular lipid divergence pattern using non-normalised dataset) indicate that there was no

369

significant effect of handling during the extraction process done over three days at two different

370

times. Ferveur and Cobb (2010) suggest that the variability in the cuticular lipid profiles of

371

different populations under different selection pressure (as is observed in this study) is possibly

372

due to different initial and undergoing evolutionary mechanism. Alternatively, the divergence

373

pattern of M and F males and females (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) could be a result of ancestry. However,

374

since M, C and F populations were established using a large population size (Ne (LHst) ~ 2250,

375

Ne (MCF) ~ 450; (Nandy et al. 2013b)), a founder effect during initial establishment is unlikely

376

to affect the MCF populations. This is also confirmed in the linear mixed modelling analysis

377

which shows effect of replicates on the cuticular lipid profile is negligible, if any in many cases

378

(see Table 1). In conclusion, reproductive isolation (in M regime but not in F regime (Syed et

379

al. 2017)) as a byproduct of sexually antagonistic coevolution cannot be explained by the

380

cuticular lipid divergence among males and females of Drosophila melanogaster M and F

381

regimes when analysed separately. However, cuticular lipid divergence in M and F at regime

382

level indicate other possible evolutionary mechanisms at play that are discussed below.

383

Isolation among M replicates in form of diverged mate preference could possibly be maintained

384

by sexual selection acting on mating signals (Syed et al. 2017). Since cuticular lipid profiles of

385

D. melanogaster MCF populations are dimorphic, one possible mechanism for this

386

reproductive isolation among M replicates could be mate choice over the divergent cuticular

387

lipid profiles. In this study, sexual selection appears to have particularly strong effect on the

388

cuticular lipid profiles in a different way at the regime level (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). If

389

we compare the cuticular lipid profiles of males and females of C regime and M regime, we

390

see that M females have diverged with respect to C females while M males have converged

391

with respect to C males considerably. This pattern indicates that under increased sexual

392

selection, M males are pushed towards a common optimum point in terms of cuticular lipid

393

profile in order to present a more preferable cuticular lipid profile to M females. Similar

394

cuticular lipid profiles of the M males may also be explained by suppression of sexually

395

selected cuticular lipids such that variability of male cuticular lipid is reduced over time. This

396

may be true since D. serrata males have been found to lower their cuticular lipid expression

397

when female : male ratio is decreased (Gershman and Rundle 2017). The female cuticular lipid

398

divergence of M could either be a result of maintaining ancestral pattern as seen in C or have

399

diverged as predicted in populations following Buridan’s ass regime (see below). On the

400

contrary, F males and F females show a diametrically opposite pattern to that of the M regime.

401

Under low sexual selection, the selection pressure is possibly weaker and hence, F males

402

diversified and/or maintain their cuticular lipid variation as seen in the C regime. Drosophila

403

serrata males exhibit cuticular lipid profile associated with increased mating success when

404

female : male ratio is increased (Gershman and Rundle 2017). In F regime where female : male

405

is high, males may evolve to display their most attractive cuticular lipids to potentially improve

406

mating success leading to varied cuticular lipid profiles in the process. The F females appear

407

to be more tightly grouped in terms of their cuticular lipid profile (in comparison to M females)

408

than C population. This indicates that F females are probably under selection pressure to

409

maintain similarity of their cuticular lipid profiles. The reason for this is not obvious and may

410

be a result of correlated evolution in some other trait affected by sexual selection. Alternatively,

411

F females may also be affected by high sexual selection (increased competition) due to altered

412

sex ratio where they have to maintain identical profile to be acceptable to males that are fewer

413

in number. Overall the cuticular lipid divergence pattern of M and F regime appears to be

414

strongly influenced by sexual selection although other possible sexual conflict resolution

415

mechanism such as Buridan’s ass paradigm (see below) cannot be ruled out.

416

Apart from speciation, a population under sexual conflict may follow other evolutionary stable

417

strategy to resolve the conflict between sexes (Gavrilets 2014). For example, in a large

418

population and/or population with significant rates of mutations, there might be diversification

419

of female traits with respect to male traits (Buridan’s ass regime) such that males, in an attempt

420

to adapt to the variability in such traits, are caught in limbo unable to increase its own fitness

421

in the population as a whole (Gavrilets and Hayashi 2005). This is relevant to the results from

422

the current study where multivariate analysis show M females are more dispersed and M males

423

form a tight group with respect to their cuticular lipid profile (see Fig. 2). It is known that the

424

male mating behavior of Drosophila melanogaster is partially mediated by female cuticular

425

lipids (Ferveur and Cobb 2010). The M population also meet the criterion for Buridan’s ass

426

regime since the population size is large (Ne ~ 450) and the block-wise differences among M

427

replicates (see Fig. 4) suggest that possibility of random mutation accumulation over several

428

generations due to allopatry. It is therefore possible that sexual conflict on cuticular lipid trait

429

in M regime has followed Buridan’s ass phenomenon where M males have been caught in an

430

uncertain intermediate stage failing to pursue either ends of cuticular lipid divergence in M

431

females. The fact that this pattern is repeated in case of females of F regime is a revelation

432

since effect of sexual conflict has been traditionally focused on males rather than females

433

(Ferveur and Cobb 2010).

434

CONCLUSION

435

Experimental studies and comparative analysis of taxonomic groups suggest that speciation is

436

possible under sexual conflict. The mathematical models support this possibility but also

437

suggest that dynamics of evolution under sexual conflict is quite varied and stochastic to a

438

point that evolution of reproductive isolation in allopatry is only one of the several other

439

outcomes. This study is an example of different reproductive traits being affected differently

440

by sexual conflict such that isolation based on mate preference, copulation duration and sperm

441

defense ability is not reflected in the mate attraction cues such as cuticular lipids. Rather sexual

442

conflict, if any, is probably reconciled in form of Buridan’s ass regime. In fact, D. melanogaster

443

individuals from high and low sexual conflict regime appear to be significantly affected by

444

sexual selection on cuticular lipid profiles. We conclude that since cuticular lipids form a basis

445

for mate recognition, M males under high sexual selection tend to keep their cuticular lipid

446

profiles similar to be acceptable by the limited number of females in the male biased regime.

447

The same may also be true for the females of female biased regimes or their cuticular lipid

448

divergence pattern may be by-product of sexual selection pressure on any other hitherto

449

unknown trait.
