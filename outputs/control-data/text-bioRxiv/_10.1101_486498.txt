Abstract
Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects
more than 1% of children in the United States. ASD risk is thought to arise from both genetic
and environmental factors, with the perinatal period as a critical window. Understanding early
transcriptional changes in ASD would assist in clarifying disease pathogenesis and identifying
biomarkers. However, little is known about umbilical cord blood gene expression profiles in
babies later diagnosed with ASD compared to non-typically developing and non-ASD (Non-TD)
or typically developing (TD) children.
Methods: Genome-wide transcript levels were measured by Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 array
in RNA from cord blood samples from both the Markers of Autism Risk in Babies--Learning
Early Signs (MARBLES) and the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) high-risk
pregnancy cohorts that enroll younger siblings of a child previously diagnosed with ASD.
Younger siblings were diagnosed based on assessments at 36 months, and 59 ASD, 92 NonTD, and 120 TD subjects were included. Using both differential expression analysis and
weighted gene correlation network analysis, gene expression between ASD and TD, and
between Non-TD and TD, was compared within each study and via meta-analysis.

Results: While cord blood gene expression differences comparing either ASD or Non-TD to TD
did not reach genome-wide significance, 172 genes were nominally differentially-expressed
between ASD and TD cord blood (log2(fold change) > 0.1, p < 0.01). These genes were
significantly enriched for functions in xenobiotic metabolism, chromatin regulation, and systemic
lupus erythematosus (FDR q < 0.05). In contrast, 66 genes were differentially-expressed
between Non-TD and TD, including 8 genes that were also differentially-expressed in ASD.
Gene coexpression modules were significantly correlated with demographic factors and cell
type proportions.
Limitations: ASD-associated gene expression differences identified in this study are subtle, as
cord blood is not the main affected tissue, it is composed of many cell types, and ASD is a
heterogeneous disorder.
Conclusions: This is the first study to identify gene expression differences in cord blood
specific to ASD. The results of this meta-analysis across two prospective pregnancy cohorts
support involvement of environmental, immune, and epigenetic mechanisms in ASD etiology.

Background
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired
social interaction and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Heritability of ASD risk has been well
established with twin and family studies and is estimated at 52% [1-3]. While rare variants with
large effects explain a relatively small proportion of all ASD cases, heritable common variants
with individually minor effects contribute substantially to ASD risk [4]. Accumulating lines of
evidence suggest that ASD arises from complex interactions between heterogeneous genetic

and environmental risk factors. Gene expression levels are influenced by both genetic and
environmental factors and determine the functional responses of cells and tissues. Postmortem
brain gene expression studies have guided understanding of ASD pathophysiology and show
evidence of changes in gene co-expression and enrichment in immune response and neuronal
activity functions [5, 6]. Peripheral blood gene expression studies in children and adults using
whole blood and in specific cell types (natural killer (NK) cell and lymphocytes) observed
enrichment of immune and inflammatory processes in differential gene expression associated
with ASD [7, 8]. Recent efforts have been focused on identifying how genetic risk factors
converge into one or more unifying pathways and pathophysiological mechanisms [9, 10]. Yet,
the majority of this work to date relies on post-mortem or post-symptom timing of sample
collection, rather than prospective assessment of gene expression.

Converging evidence suggests that most of the changes in the brain associated with ASD are
initiated during prenatal brain development [11, 12], but the complete nature of these changes
remain unknown. Umbilical cord blood captures fetal blood as well as the exchanges across the
feto-placental unit and provides a distinct insight into prenatal development. A unique cell
mixture is represented in umbilical cord blood, including hematopoietic stem cells, B cells, NK
cells, T cells, monocytes, granulocytes and nucleated red blood cells [13]. Cord blood gene
expression would reflect the immune response as well as endocrine and cellular communication
essential for fetal development near the time of birth.

While several studies have previously examined child blood gene expression differences in ASD
[8, 14-20], this is the first study to take advantage of cord blood samples collected from two
prospective studies (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies--Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) and
the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI)) in order to assess the perinatal
transcriptional changes that precede ASD diagnosis in high-risk children [21, 22]. The subjects

in this study are all siblings of children with ASD and thus have a 13-fold increased risk for ASD
compared to the general population [23]. They are also at a higher risk for non-typical
neurodevelopment, including deficits in attention and behavior. We measured cord blood gene
expression levels using the Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 array and compared gene-level
differential expression, gene set enrichment, and gene coexpression networks across ASD,
non-typically developing (Non-TD) and neurotypical children (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). Studylevel results were then combined in a meta-analysis to investigate cord blood transcriptional
dysregulation in ASD.

Methods
Sample population and biosample collection
MARBLES
The MARBLES study recruits Northern California mothers from lists of children receiving
services through the California Department of Developmental Services who have a child with
confirmed ASD and are planning a pregnancy or are pregnant with another child. Inclusion
criteria for the study were: 1) mother or father has one or more biological child(ren) with ASD; 2)
mother is 18 years or older; 3) mother is pregnant; 4) mother speaks, reads, and understands
English sufficiently to complete the protocol and the younger sibling will be taught to speak
English; 5) mother lives within 2.5 hours of the Davis/Sacramento region at time of enrollment.
As described in more detail elsewhere [21], demographic, diet, lifestyle, environmental, and
medical information were prospectively collected through telephone-assisted interviews and
mailed questionnaires throughout pregnancy and the postnatal period. Mothers were provided
with sampling kits for cord blood collection prior to delivery. MARBLES research staff made
arrangements with obstetricians/midwives and birth hospital labor and delivery staff to assure
proper sample collection and temporary storage. Infants received standardized
neurodevelopmental assessments beginning at 6 months, as described below, and concluding

at 3 years of age. For this study, all children actively enrolled by March 1, 2017 (n = 347) with
umbilical cord blood collected in a PAXgene Blood RNA tube (n = 262, 76%) were included.

EARLI
The EARLI study is a high-risk pregnancy cohort that recruited and followed pregnant mothers
who had an older child diagnosed with ASD through pregnancy, birth, and the first three years
of life. EARLI families were recruited at four EARLI Network sites (Drexel/Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia; Johns Hopkins/Kennedy Krieger Institute; University of California (UC) Davis; and
Kaiser Permanente Northern California) in three distinct US regions (Southeast Pennsylvania,
Northeast Maryland, and Northern California). In addition to having a biological child with ASD
confirmed by EARLI study clinicians, to be eligible mothers also had to communicate in English
or Spanish and, at recruitment, meet the following criteria: be 18 years or older; live within two
hours of a study site; and be < 29 weeks pregnant. The design of the EARLI study is described
in more detail in Newschaffer et al. [22]. EARLI research staff made arrangements with
obstetricians/midwives and birth hospital labor and delivery staff to ensure proper cord blood
sample collection and temporary storage. The development of children born into the cohort was
closely followed through age three years. For this study, 212 infants born into EARLI as a
singleton birth and followed to one year of age were considered for inclusion. Of the 212 infants,
97 were excluded because they were either missing umbilical cord blood samples or outcome
measures at 36 months, leaving a final sample of 115.

Diagnostic outcomes
In both studies, development was assessed by trained, reliable examiners. Diagnostic
assessments at three years included the gold standard Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule (ADOS) [24, 25], the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) [26] conducted
with parents, and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) [27], a test of cognitive, language,

and motor development. Participants were classified into one of three outcome groups, ASD,
typically developing (TD), and Non-TD, based on a previously published algorithm that uses
ADOS and MSEL scores [28, 29]. Children with ASD outcomes had scores over the ADOS
cutoff and met DSM-5 criteria for ASD. The Non-TD group was defined as children with low
MSEL scores (i.e., two or more MSEL subscales that are more than 1.5 standard deviations
(SD) below average or at least one MSEL subscale that was more than 2 SD below average),
elevated ADOS scores (i.e., within 3 points of the ASD cutoff), or both. Children with TD
outcomes had all MSEL scores within 2 SD and no more than one MSEL subscale 1.5 SD
below the normative mean and scores on the ADOS at least three or more points below the
ASD cutoff.

Demographic characteristics
In both the MARBLES and EARLI studies, demographic information was prospectively collected
through in-person and telephone-assisted interviews and mailed questionnaires throughout
pregnancy and the postnatal period. Cotinine was measured in maternal urine during
pregnancy, and maternal smoking was identified if the concentration of cotinine was > 50 ng/mL
[30]. Within each study, demographic characteristics were stratified by diagnostic outcome and
compared using Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and one-way ANOVA for
continuous variables.

RNA isolation and expression assessment
In both MARBLES and EARLI, umbilical cord blood was collected at the time of birth in
PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes with the RNA stabilization reagent (BD Biosciences) and stored at 80°C. RNA isolation was performed with the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. RNA from 236 (90%) of the 262 MARBLES PAXgene blood samples
and all of the EARLI PAXgene blood samples met quality control standards (RIN ≥ 7.0 and

concentration ≥ 35ng/uL) and volume requirements. Total RNA was converted to cDNA and in
vitro transcribed to biotin-labeled cRNA, which was hybridized to Human Gene 2.0 Affymetrix
microarray chips by the Johns Hopkins Sequencing and Microarray core. EARLI and MARBLES
samples were measured separately and in multiple batches within each study. The
manufacturer’s protocol was followed for all washing, staining and scanning procedures. The
raw fluorescence data (in Affymetrix CEL file format) with one perfect match and one
mismatched probe in each set were analyzed using oligo package in R.

Data preprocessing
Within each study, signal distribution was first assessed in perfect-match probe intensity and
Robust Multi-Chip Average (RMA) normalized data [31]. During the quality control step, we
identified outliers using the arrayQualityMetrics and oligo R packages [32, 33]. Outliers were
excluded based on loading in principal component 1, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, median
normalized unscaled standard error, and the sum of the distances to all other arrays. For the
MARBLES study, 3 outlier samples were identified and excluded, and another 71 children had
not yet received a diagnosis by April 12, 2018 so were excluded; 162 samples were normalized
using RMA. For the EARLI study, 6 outliers were identified and excluded, then 109 samples
were normalized using RMA. Probes were annotated at the transcript level using the
pd.hugene.2.0.st R package [34], and those assigned to a gene (36,459 probes) were used in
subsequent analyses.

Surrogate variable analysis
Surrogate variable analysis (SVA) was used to estimate and adjust for unmeasured
environmental, demographic, cell type proportion, and technical factors that may have
substantial effects on gene expression using the SVA R package [35, 36]. 21 surrogate
variables were detected in normalized expression data from MARBLES subjects for both the

ASD versus TD and Non-TD versus TD comparisons. Specific factors associated with surrogate
variables in MARBLES using linear regression included array batch, sex, maternal BMI,
gestational age, delivery method, child ethnicity, and maternal education (False Discovery Rate
(FDR) q < 0.1, Additional file 1: Fig. S2a). In normalized expression data from EARLI subjects,
11 surrogate variables were detected for the ASD versus TD comparison, which were
associated with sex, birthweight, gestational age, and paternal age (FDR q < 0.1, Additional file
1: Fig. S3a). 12 surrogate variables were detected for the Non-TD versus TD comparison, which
were associated with sex and gestational age (FDR q < 0.1, Additional file 1: Fig. S4a).
Proportion of variance in expression of each gene explained by each surrogate variable was
determined using the variancePartition R package [37]. Median variance explained by each
surrogate variable ranged from 0.3% to 5.6% in MARBLES (Additional file 1: Fig. S2b). In
EARLI, median variance explained by each surrogate variable ranged from 0.8% to 7.1% for the
ASD versus TD comparison and 0.5% to 7.2% for the Non-TD versus TD comparison
(Additional file 1: Fig. S3b, S4b).

Differential gene expression
Differential expression was determined using the limma package in R with diagnosis and all
surrogate variables included in the linear model [38] (Additional file 1: Fig. S5, S6). ASD versus
TD and Non-TD versus TD differential expression results were extracted from a single model
with three levels for diagnosis for MARBLES, while two pairwise models were used for EARLI,
although this did not affect the results (1 vs 2 model meta-analysis fold change ASD vs TD
Pearson’s r = 0.97, Non-TD vs TD Pearson’s r = 0.99). Fold change and standard error from
each study were input into the METAL command-line tool for meta-analysis using the standard
error analysis scheme with genomic control correction [39]. In this approach, the fold changes
from each study are weighted using the inverse of the standard error. Using the meta-analyzed

data, differential probes were then identified as those with a nominal p-value < 0.01 and an
average absolute log2(fold change) > 0.1.

Gene overlap analysis
Gene overlap analysis by Fisher’s exact test was performed using the GeneOverlap R package
[40]. Gene symbols annotated to differentially-expressed probes were compared to autismrelated or blood cell-type associated gene lists [41] for overlap relative to all genes annotated to
probes on the array. Genes with variation previously associated with autism were obtained from
the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) Gene database and a recent
genome-wide association study meta-analysis [42, 43], while genes with expression previously
associated with autism were obtained from multiple previous reports [6, 8, 44, 45]. Significant
overlaps were those with an FDR q-value < 0.05.

Overrepresentation enrichment analysis
Differential probes identified during meta-analysis were converted to Entrez gene IDs using the
biomaRt R package [46]. Functional enrichment of only differential probes by hypergeometric
test was relative to all probes on the array and was performed using the WebGestalt online tool
with default parameters for the overrepresentation enrichment analysis method [47]. Enrichment
databases included WebGestalt defaults and also a custom database of recently evolved genes
obtained from [48]. WebGestalt default databases queried included Gene Ontology, KEGG,
WikiPathways, Reactome, PANTHER, MSigDB, Human Phenotype Ontology, DisGeNET,
OMIM, PharmGKB, and DrugBank. Significant enrichments were those with an FDR q-value <
0.05.

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)

All probes included in the analysis were ranked using meta-analysis log2(fold change) and input
into the WebGestalt online tool using default parameters for the GSEA method [47]. GSEA
assesses whether genes in biologically-predefined sets occur toward the top or bottom of a
ranked list of all examined genes more than expected by chance [49]. GSEA calculates an
enrichment score normalized to the set size to estimate the extent of non-random distribution of
the predefined gene set, and it then tests the significance of the enrichment with a permutation
test. Enrichment databases included WebGestalt defaults (see above). Significant gene sets
were called as those with an FDR q-value < 0.05.

Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA)
WGCNA was performed using the WGCNA R package [50]. RMA-normalized expression data
were adjusted for batch using ComBat due to large batch effects in MARBLES [36]. Samples
were clustered with hierarchical clustering using the average method and excluded using static
tree cutting with cut height set to 100, resulting in one outlier being removed for each study [50].
Expression data were renormalized with RMA and adjusted for batch after removing outliers.
Final samples for WGCNA included 59 ASD (41 MARBLES/19 EARLI), 91 Non-TD (44
MARBLES/47 EARLI), and 119 TD (76 MARBLES/43 EARLI). Signed topological overlap
matrices (TOMs) were obtained separately for each study in a single block using the biweight
midcorrelation with the maximum percentile for outliers set to 0.1 and the soft-thresholding
power set to 10. Study-specific TOMs were calibrated using full quantile normalization, and a
consensus TOM was calculated as the parallel minimum of the study-specific TOMs. Modules
were identified using dynamic hybrid tree cutting with deepSplit set to 4, and modules with a
dissimilarity < 0.1 were merged. Module hub probes were determined as the probe in each
module with the highest module membership. Study-specific module eigengenes were
correlated with demographic factors or estimated cell type proportions using the biweight
midcorrelation with the maximum percentile for outliers set to 0.1 and including only pairwise-

complete observations. Study-specific correlation Z-scores were combined in a meta-analysis
using Stouffer’s method with weights given by the square root of the sample n [51]. P-values
were adjusted for all comparisons using the FDR method. Significant correlations were called as
those with an FDR q-value < 0.05.

Cell type proportion deconvolution
Estimation of cell type proportions was performed using CIBERSORT [41]. Final samples for
cell type deconvolution were the same as for WGCNA: 59 ASD (41 MARBLES/19 EARLI), 91
Non-TD (44 MARBLES/47 EARLI), and 119 TD (76 MARBLES/43 EARLI). RMA-normalized
expression data was adjusted for batch due to large batch effects in MARBLES. To correspond
with identifiers used by CIBERSORT, array probes were matched to HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) gene symbols using the biomaRt R package [46]. RMAnormalized expression data and the default LM22 adult blood signature genes file were input
into the CIBERSORT web tool [41]. A similar signature genes file was not available for umbilical
cord blood. Relative and absolute modes were run together, with 100 permutations and without
quantile normalization. Deconvolution goodness of fit p-value was < 0.05 for all subjects.
Estimated cell type proportions were correlated with demographic factors within each study
using the biweight midcorrelation with the maximum percentile for outliers set to 0.1 and
including only pairwise-complete observations. Study-specific correlation Z-scores were
combined in a meta-analysis using Stouffer’s method with weights given by the square root of
the sample n [51]. P-values were adjusted for all comparisons using the FDR method.
Significant correlations were called as those with an FDR q-value < 0.05.

MARBLES subjects in the final analysis included 41 ASD (30 male, 11 female), 44 Non-TD (27
male, 17 female), and 77 TD subjects (40 male, 37 female). Paternal age and gestational age
were nominally associated with diagnostic group in MARBLES, with slightly increased paternal
age and gestational age for the ASD subjects (paternal age p = 0.02, gestational age p = 0.04,
Table 1). Other demographic characteristics were not associated with diagnostic group among
MARBLES subjects. EARLI subjects in the final analysis included 18 ASD (13 male, 5 female),
48 Non-TD (23 male, 25 female), and 43 TD subjects (19 male, 24 female). Child race and
ethnicity and home ownership were nominally associated with diagnostic group in EARLI (race
and ethnicity p = 0.02, home ownership p = 0.01, Table 2). Specifically, the ASD group included
a lower proportion of white subjects and a lower rate of home ownership. Other demographic
characteristics were not associated with diagnostic group among EARLI subjects. In the metaanalysis, which combined both the MARBLES and EARLI studies, gene expression was
analyzed in 271 subjects, including 120 TD, 59 ASD, and 92 Non-TD subjects.

ASD-associated differential gene expression in cord blood
We examined differential expression of single genes in cord blood samples in association with
ASD diagnosis status at 36 months. In meta-analysis, no transcripts were differentially
expressed at a conservative FDR q-value < 0.05. Under the thresholds of log2(fold change) >
0.1 and nominal p-value < 0.01, 172 transcripts were differentially expressed between ASD and
TD cord blood (ASD n = 59, TD n = 120, Fig. 1a, Additional file 2: Table S1). Among these
differential transcripts, 87 were upregulated and 85 were downregulated, and the median
absolute log2(fold change) was 0.12. The differential transcript with the greatest absolute fold
change was TUBB2A (log2(fold change) = 0.35, standard error = 0.12, p = 4.8E-3, Fig. 1b, Table
3). Additionally, the estimated fold changes for differentially-expressed genes were strongly
correlated between the two studies (Pearson’s r = 0.80, p < 2.2E-16), although the fold changes
of all transcripts were weakly correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.02, p = 4.6E-4, Additional File 1: Fig.
S7a). Many of the differentially-expressed genes were noncoding or uncharacterized transcripts;
however, the median expression of differentially-expressed genes was not lower than nondifferentially-expressed genes on the array (MARBLES: differential = 4.70, non-differential =

Specifically, SLC7A3, VSIG4, and MIR1226 have been associated with ASD in genetic studies
[42, 52], while SNORD104, OR2AG2, and DHX30 were differentially expressed in the same
direction in ASD in gene expression studies [8, 44]. Further, GFI1, GPR171, KIR2DL4, PTGIR,
and TRPM6 were differentially expressed in ASD cord blood and are also differentially
expressed in specific blood cell types, including natural killer cells and T cells, although a
significant enrichment was not observed (q > 0.05, Additional file 1: Fig. S10, Additional file 2:
Table S3) [41].

Overrepresentation enrichment analysis, which looks for overlap of only differentially-expressed
genes with biologically-predefined gene lists, revealed that ASD differential transcripts were
significantly enriched for functions in the response to toxic substances (TRPM6, CYP1A1, FOS,
GCH1, AC012476.1, RAD51, and AQP10, fold enrichment = 9.5, q = 0.027) and ultraviolet
radiation (CDO1, CYP1A1, FOS, and GCH1, fold enrichment = 7.6, q = 0.037, Fig. 1c,
Additional file 2: Table S4). Both of these functional enrichments included the genes CYP1A1,
FOS, and GCH1. Additionally, downregulated transcripts were enriched for functioning in blood
coagulation (GNG12, MAFF, PF4, and PLG, fold enrichment = 12.5, q = 0.009) and xenobiotic
metabolism (CDO1, CYP1A1, GCH1, and PLG, fold enrichment = 8.6, q = 0.019), but no
significant enrichments were observed for upregulated transcripts alone.

Using fold changes to rank all transcripts for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we
observed significant enrichment for upregulation of gene sets involved in chromatin regulation (q
< 0.05, Fig. 2, Additional file 2: Table S5). In other words, genes associated with chromatin
regulation tended to be ranked toward the top of the distribution of fold change in ASD cord
blood. Chromatin gene sets upregulated in ASD included DNA methylation (23 leading edge
(LE) transcripts, normalized enrichment score (NES) = 2.16, q = 0.009), condensation of
prophase chromosomes (24 LE transcripts, NES = 2.11, q = 0.007), nucleosome assembly (24

LE transcripts, NES = 1.96, q = 0.026), histone deacetylase (HDAC)-mediated deacetylation (30
LE transcripts, NES = 1.90, q = 0.040), and polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated
methylation (22 LE transcripts, NES = 1.89, q = 0.002). Additionally, the gene set for the
autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus was significantly upregulated (45 LE
transcripts, NES = 2.13, q = 0.003). Most of the genes associated with these sets compose a
cluster of histone genes located at the 6p22.2 locus, which was also enriched (27 LE
transcripts, NES = 2.15, q = 0.007). The above findings of differential expression across two
prospective cohorts suggest transcriptional dysregulation in environmentally-responsive genes
is present at birth in cord blood of high-risk subjects later diagnosed with ASD.

Non-TD-associated differential gene expression in cord blood
To assess the specificity of ASD-associated transcriptional differences in cord blood, we also
examined differential expression between cord blood samples from infants later classified as
Non-TD compared to TD at 36 months. Meta-analysis results showed no transcripts
differentially expressed at a conservative FDR q-value < 0.05. Under the thresholds of log2(fold
change) > 0.1 and nominal p-value < 0.01, 66 transcripts were differential, with 38 upregulated
and 28 downregulated (Non-TD n = 92, TD n = 120, Fig. 3a, Additional file 2: Table S6). The
median absolute log2(fold change) was 0.12. The gene with the greatest fold change between
Non-TD and TD subjects was TAS2R46 (log2(fold change) = 0.37, standard error = 0.12, Fig.
3b, Table 4). Further, the estimated fold changes of Non-TD-associated differentially-expressed
genes were highly correlated between the individual studies (Pearson’s r = 0.80, p = 3.9E-16);
however, fold changes of all transcripts were weakly correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.01, p = 0.10,
Additional file 1: Fig. S7b). Additionally, median expression of differentially-expressed genes
was not different from other genes on the array (MARBLES: differential = 4.48, non-differential =
4.64, p = 0.65; EARLI: differential = 4.15, non-differential = 4.20, p = 0.90; Additional file 1: Fig.

although the overlap was not statistically significant (q > 0.05, Additional file 1: Fig. S9,
Additional file 2: Table S2). Genetic deficiencies in MIR4269 have been previously associated
with a reduced risk for ASD [43], while DHCR24, GNAO1, and TYMS were differentially
expressed in ASD in other studies [8, 44]. Additionally, none of the Non-TD differentiallyexpressed genes were known cell-type specific genes (Additional file 1: Fig. S10, Additional file
2: Table S3)[41]. Differentially expressed genes in Non-TD that overlap genes previously
associated with ASD likely function in general neurodevelopment.

Because genes recently evolved in primates have been hypothesized to play a role in human
neurodevelopment, differentially-expressed genes in Non-TD cord blood were assessed for
enrichment in recently evolved genes by vertebrate lineages, ranging from tetrapods to
homininae using overrepresentation enrichment analysis [48]. Non-TD-associated genes were
significantly enriched for genes recently evolved in mammalia, theria, eutheria, boreoeutheria,
euarchontoglires, primates, catarrhini, and hominidae, with the greatest enrichment in primatespecific genes (fold enrichment = 7.5, q = 2.1E-5, Fig. 3c, Additional file 2: Table S7). Of genes
that evolved in primates, SLC52A1, SPANXN5, and TRIM49B were upregulated in Non-TD cord
blood, while FAM86C1, RASA4, RASA4B, and TRIM73 were downregulated (Fig. 3d). In
contrast, ASD differentially-expressed genes were not significantly enriched in recently evolved
genes from any of the vertebrate lineages (q > 0.05).

After GSEA with all probes ranked by fold change in Non-TD compared to TD subjects, we
observed significant enrichment for upregulation of sensory perception gene sets (q < 0.05, Fig.
4a, Additional file 2: Table S8). Taste receptor activity (14 LE transcripts, NES = 2.30, q < 1E-4),
metabotropic glutamate receptors (17 LE transcripts, NES = 2.21, q = 4.9E-3), and olfactory
receptor activity (105 LE transcripts, NES = 1.96, q = 0.018) gene sets were all upregulated in
cord blood from Non-TD subjects. Additionally, gene sets that interact with the compounds

quinine (19 LE transcripts, NES = 2.30, q = 2.0E-3) and citric acid (22 LE transcripts, NES =

LE transcripts, NES = -2.02, q = 0.037) and H2-receptor antagonists (6 LE transcripts, NES = 2.03, q = 0.047) were downregulated. Taste receptor genes included in these gene sets and the
top Non-TD-upregulated gene, TAS2R46, are located at the 12p13.2 locus, which was also
enriched (16 LE transcripts, NES = 2.11, q = 8.3E-3).

which was more than expected by chance (odds ratio = 28.3, p = 1.67E-9, Fig. 5a). Specifically,

IGLV1-40, LRRC37A4P, MIR1299, PMCHL2, and TRBV11-2 were upregulated, while

subjects (Fig. 5b). LRRC37AP, MIR1299, PMCHL2, and TRBV11-2 were among the top
upregulated genes in Non-TD subjects (Fig. 3b). Additionally, the fold changes across all
transcripts were moderately correlated between the ASD versus TD and Non-TD versus TD
comparisons both within study and in the meta-analysis (Meta-analysis log2(fold change)
Pearson’s r = 0.38, p < 2.2E-16, Additional file 1: Fig. S7c-e). These findings suggest that some

Coexpression network analysis and cell type deconvolution in cord blood from high-risk children
As a complementary approach to differential gene expression analysis, we performed WGCNA
to identify consensus gene coexpression modules and their correlations with ASD or Non-TD
diagnosis and other variables. 79 consensus coexpression modules were identified, which

ranged in size from 20 to 4137 transcripts (Additional file 1: Fig. S12, Additional file 2: Table S9,
S10). Overall the module eigengene networks were highly preserved between MARBLES and
EARLI subjects, indicating the identified consensus modules are robust (Overall preservation =
0.93, Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Module eigengenes were correlated with diagnosis and
demographic factors within each study and these results were combined in meta-analysis (Fig.
6, Additional file 1: Fig. S14-16, Additional file 2: Table S11). Across MARBLES and EARLI
subjects, modules were identified that significantly correlated with diagnostic group, sex,
gestational age, birthweight, ethnicity, paternal age, delivery method, and maternal smoking
(FDR q < 0.05, Fig. 6, Additional file 1: Fig. S16). In particular, gestational age, birthweight, and
paternal age were associated with more than 20 modules each, suggesting that these factors
have major effects on gene expression in cord blood from high-risk children. Interestingly, the
skyblue1 module was significantly upregulated in ASD compared to TD subjects (z-score = 3.4,
FDR q = 0.046, Additional file 1: Fig. S17a-b, Additional file 2: Table S11). Skyblue1 was also
significantly correlated with sex (z-score = -28.1, FDR q = 2.7E-172), paternal age (z-score =
2.2, FDR q = 0.047), and maternal smoking (z-score = -3.4, FDR q = 0.015). Probes in skyblue1
map to 21 genes, 18 of which are located only on chromosome Y, explaining the strong
upregulation in males (Additional file 1: Fig. S17c). Further, two of these genes, TTTY10 and
ZFY, were upregulated in ASD compared to TD subjects in this study, which is a significant
enrichment (Additional file 1: Fig. S17d, odds ratio = 33.6, p = 0.002). However, the association
of skyblue1 with ASD may be driven by increased expression of skyblue1 genes in males and a
greater frequency of males with ASD.

Because cord blood is a heterogenous tissue composed of many cell types with distinct
transcriptional profiles, we examined the proportions of 22 cell types estimated with the
CIBERSORT web tool and their correlation with diagnostic group and demographic variables.
The most prevalent cell types detected in cord blood overall were neutrophils and naïve CD4+ T
cells, which made up 26% and 24% of whole cord blood, respectively (Additional file 2: Table
S12). When cell type proportions were compared to diagnostic group and demographic factors
within each study and combined in meta-analysis, no cell types differed between diagnostic
groups (Fig. 7a). However, cell fractions were significantly correlated with demographic factors
including sex, gestational age, birthweight, delivery method, and maternal smoking (FDR q <
0.05, Fig. 7b, Additional file 2: Table S13). To determine the correspondence of consensus
modules with the proportions of specific cell types, the module eigengenes were compared to
the cell type fractions followed by meta-analysis. The eigengenes for the majority of consensus
modules were strongly and significantly correlated with the proportion of multiple cell types
(FDR q < 0.05, Additional file 1: Fig. S18, Additional file 2: Table S14). The cell types
significantly correlated with the most modules were neutrophils, naïve CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T
cells, M0 macrophages, and plasma cells, which were associated with more than 30 modules
each. In contrast, skyblue1, which was correlated with diagnosis, along with sex, paternal age,
and maternal smoking, was not correlated with the proportions of any examined cell type

(Additional file 1: Fig. S16, S18, Additional file 2: Table S14). As an example, the grey60 module
was positively correlated with the proportions of naïve B cells, plasma cells, and activated
dendritic cells, but negatively correlated with resting NK cells and neutrophils (FDR q < 0.05,
Additional file 1: Fig. S18). The hub gene for grey60 was CD79A, which encodes Iga, the B cell
antigen receptor component necessary for signal transduction [53]. Interestingly, the grey60
module eigengene, CD79A expression, and the proportion of naïve B cells were all significantly
upregulated during cesarean delivery (FDR q < 0.05) and nominally downregulated in ASD
compared to Non-TD subjects (p < 0.05, Additional file 1: Fig. S19, Additional file 2: Table S11,
S13). These results from coexpression and cell type deconvolution analyses suggest that
biological factors including cell type, gestational age, birthweight, and paternal age are major
drivers of interindividual variation in cord blood gene expression.

Discussion
Perinatal transcriptional alterations in ASD
Based on meta-analysis across two high-risk pregnancy cohorts of similar design, we examined
gene expression differences in cord blood between high-risk children who went on to develop
ASD, were Non-TD, or were TD at 36 months. Significant differential gene expression in cord
blood at individual genes was not observed in individuals who developed ASD compared to TD
after adjusting for multiple comparisons. However, significant gene set enrichment was seen in
toxic substance response, blood coagulation, chromatin regulation, and autoimmune response
functions among genes differentially expressed at a nominal level in ASD.

Several of the nominally differentially-expressed genes have been previously associated with
neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD via genetic association studies. However, overlap
with prior findings was not statistically significant, indicating that this may be coincidental.
Included in the top upregulated genes in ASD was TUBB2A, a component of microtubules.
TUBB2A is expressed in fetal brain and is mutated in complex cortical dysplasia, a
neurodevelopmental disorder that involves seizures [54]. SLC7A3 and VSIG4 were also
upregulated in ASD and have been previously associated as putative ASD risk genes [42]. Rare
missense variants have been found in ASD subjects at SLC7A3, which is a cationic amino acid
transporter selectively expressed in brain [55]. Nonsense and splice site variants have been
found in ASD subjects at VSIG4, a complement C3 receptor that functions in pathogen

recognition and inhibition of helper T-cell activation [56-58]. Overlap of both genetic and
transcriptional association with ASD suggests that these genes would be interesting targets for
additional mechanistic studies in relation to ASD.

Environmental factors are also thought to contribute to ASD risk, especially during the perinatal
period, a sensitive window for neurodevelopment [59]. Genes differentially expressed in cord
blood from ASD subjects, including CYP1A1 and GCH1, were significantly enriched for
functions in xenobiotic metabolism and response to both toxic substances and ultraviolet
radiation. Notably, CYP1A1 was downregulated in ASD cord blood and has been previously
found to be transcriptionally regulated in blood by toxicants that affect neurodevelopment,
including polychlorinated biphenyls [60-62]. GCH1--which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the
synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, a precursor to folate, dopamine, and serotonin [63]--was also
downregulated in cord blood from ASD subjects. GCH1 expression increases in response to
valproic acid, an anti-epileptic drug associated with behavioral deficits in mice and increased
risk of autism in humans after in utero exposure [64, 65]. Interestingly, GCH1 is genetically
associated with ASD subphenotypes, is downregulated in peripheral blood from ASD children,
and its product tetrahydrobiopterin is decreased in cerebrospinal fluid from ASD subjects [17,
66, 67]. These environmentally responsive genes may have altered expression due to increased
genetic susceptibility and/or early life exposure to toxicants in patients with ASD [68, 69].

Epigenetic modifications, such as those to DNA and histone protein subunits, are affected by
both genetic and environmental factors and are thought to play a role in mediating ASD risk [70,
71]. Immune dysregulation has also been found in children with ASD, and immune cells rely on
epigenetic regulation for lineage commitment and cell activation in response to infection [72,

(SLE) were also upregulated, including histone-encoding, complement pathway, and antigen
presentation genes. Epigenetic dysregulation is a feature of SLE, including global DNA
hypomethylation, histone H3 and H4 hypoacetylation, and H3K9 hypomethylation in CD4+ T
cells [74-76]. Notably, maternal SLE increases risk for ASD in offspring, suggesting an
association between these two disorders [77]. Together, this implicates both epigenetic and
immune mechanisms in ASD pathobiology.

Perinatal transcriptional alterations in Non-TD
To assess the specificity of cord blood gene expression changes in ASD compared to other
neurodevelopmental disorders, this analysis examined transcriptional differences in Non-TD
compared to TD subjects across the two studies. While no single genes were significantly
differentially expressed in Non-TD subjects after adjusting for multiple comparisons, sets of
functionally-related genes were enriched among nominally differentially-expressed genes.
Significantly enriched gene sets included sensory perception and primate specific genes. The
top upregulated gene in Non-TD cord blood was TAS2R46, encoding a member of the taste 2
receptor (TAS2R) family, which was included in the top upregulated gene set, taste receptor
activity. Upregulated genes in this gene set were primarily other TAS2Rs located at the 12p13.2
locus. TAS2Rs are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) highly expressed in taste receptor
cells and are associated with the perception of bitter taste [78]. Interestingly, individuals with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy have previously been found to perceive
bitter tastes more intensely than healthy controls [79, 80]. TAS2Rs are also expressed in blood
leukocytes, where they function in chemosensation of foodborne flavor compounds and
response to food uptake [81]. Further, TAS2Rs are upregulated in leukocytes from asthma
patients and levels of lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines are decreased by
TAS2R agonists [82]. Taste receptor upregulation may reflect altered chemosensation in the
immune and nervous systems in Non-TD subjects.

Differentially-expressed genes in cord blood from Non-TD subjects included genes recently
evolved in primates and genes that function in neurodevelopment. Primate-specific genes
originated at a similar evolutionary time that the neocortex expanded and have biased
expression for the fetal neocortex in humans [48]. RASA4 is a fetal-biased primate-specific gene
that was also one of the top downregulated genes in Non-TD subjects. RASA4 is a GTPaseactivating protein in the Ras signaling pathway that functions in the activation of T cells, mast
cells, and macrophages [83-85]. Children with Non-TD were also observed to have
downregulation of GNAO1, encoding a G-protein alpha subunit important for neurodevelopment
and synaptic signaling. Mutations in GNAO1 are associated with epileptic encephalopathy,
involuntary movements, and intellectual disability [86, 87]. Additionally, missense mutations and
downregulation of GNAO1 in lymphocytes occur in individuals with schizophrenia [88, 89]. In
individuals with ASD, GNAO1 is upregulated in post-mortem cortex [6]. Further, GNAO1 is
required in mast cells for toll-like receptor 2-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine release,
suggesting GNAO1 functions in cell signaling in both the nervous and immune systems [90].

Cord blood as a window into transcriptional alterations specific to ASD
Umbilical cord blood gene expression offers a unique snapshot of molecular differences in
perinatal life, a critical window for neurodevelopment [91]. Hematopoietic cells in the blood are
actively differentiating and responding to environmental cues, such as pathogens and
xenobiotics [92, 93]. Epigenetic marks written during this period, which reflect short-term
transcriptional activity, have the potential to have long-term effects on gene regulation and cell
function [94, 95]. Signals from the immune system cross the blood-brain barrier during gestation
and influence the development of the brain [96]. Toxicant exposure during gestation can also
impact brain development [97, 98]. In this study, genes involved in toxic substance response,
xenobiotic metabolism, and chromatin regulation were altered in cord blood from subjects

diagnosed with ASD at 36 months. Transcriptional differences in cord blood from ASD and NonTD subjects compared to TD subjects were largely independent, with only 8 genes in common.
Enriched gene sets associated with Non-TD expression included sensory perception and
primate-specific genes and did not overlap with ASD expression gene sets. Further, genes
associated with ASD in previous studies of genetic variation and gene expression had few
overlaps with ASD-associated genes in cord blood [6, 8, 42-44]. Instead, cord blood ASD genes
likely represent tissue-specific environmentally-responsive genes that may reflect in utero
exposures and long-term altered neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Major factors contributing to transcriptional variability in whole cord blood
While the purpose of this study was to identify changes in cord blood gene expression
associated with ASD and Non-TD diagnosis, we also identified biological factors associated with
transcription variation in cord blood, including gestational age, birthweight, paternal age, and
cell type composition. Gestational age was correlated with many consensus gene coexpression
modules in cord blood, and it likely reflects ongoing differentiation and expansion of
hematopoietic cells captured at different developmental timepoints. Specifically, gestational age
was positively correlated with the estimated proportion of neutrophils and negatively correlated
with the proportions of CD8+ T cells, naïve CD4+ T cells, and resting mast cells, suggesting
alterations in these cell types are contributing to variability in gene expression related to
gestational age. Notably, birthweight was correlated with many of the same gene coexpression
modules as gestational age and is itself correlated with gestational age, so modules associated
with birthweight likely reflect gestational age as well.

A mostly independent set of coexpression modules were correlated with paternal age.
Increased paternal age has previously been associated with global changes in transcription in
peripheral blood lymphocytes, including a downregulation of genes involved in transcriptional

36
regulation and a decrease in the distribution of gene expression variance [99]. Interestingly,
both increased paternal age and decreased gene expression variance have also been
associated with ASD [99, 100]. The mechanism for the effect of paternal age on transcription is
still unclear, but previous studies have observed increases in telomere length and de novo
mutations and alterations in DNA methylation at specific genes in offspring from older fathers
[101-103].

The factor with the strongest association with cord blood gene expression was cell type
composition, as observed previously [104]. The cell types whose proportions correlated with the
most modules were neutrophils, naïve CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, M0 macrophages, and
plasma cells. Neutrophils and naïve CD4+ T cells were also the most prevalent cell types in cord
blood. The strong correlation of estimated cell type proportions with coexpression modules
suggests that variability between samples in cell type composition is contributing a large portion
of the transcriptional signal measured in whole cord blood. Overall, the large impact of biological
factors on gene expression in a bulk tissue such as cord blood makes detecting differentiallyexpressed genes associated with a heterogeneous disorder such as ASD practically difficult.
Future studies should take care to reduce these sources of noise, by isolating specific cell
populations, selecting subjects with similar gestational and paternal age, or focusing on more
narrow ASD endophenotypes [105].

Limitations
Cord blood samples from two enriched autism risk pregnancy cohort studies were analyzed
together to improve the power to detect differential gene expression between ASD and TD
individuals. Meta-analysis substantially increased the total number of ASD and Non-TD
subjects; however, the study was not adequately powered to detect moderate differences at a
single gene level after correcting for multiple comparisons. Differential genes used in the

37
enrichment analysis also did not meet multiple comparison-corrected statistical significance.
Lack of statistical evidence of individual differential genes does not eliminate the potential of
identifying a biologically-significant gene set enrichment across diagnostic groups; however, the
results should be interpreted cautiously. ASD is a heterogeneous disorder and this may mask
differential expression. The two cohort studies coordinated classifying participants into ASD,
Non-TD, and TD diagnostic groups using the same metrics to improve consistency between the
studies. Nonetheless, it is possible that heterogeneity within ASD remains in this study without
further breaking down the group into subtypes.

The two cohorts used the same platform to measure the RNA expression levels and were
subject to the limitations in transcript coverage and measurement precision of the microarray
platform. Transcripts not covered by a probe on the array were not analyzed in this study, and
targeted quantitative analysis in the general population would be needed to validate specific
transcriptional changes as ASD risk biomarkers. Additionally, genetic, epigenetic, and
environmental variation is known to impact both gene expression and ASD risk, but this was not
investigated in this study. Future studies that integrate cord blood gene expression with genetic,
epigenetic, and environmental factors will be important to improve understanding of ASD
etiology.

Conclusions
In the first study to investigate gene expression in cord blood from high-risk newborns later
diagnosed with ASD, we identified nominally statistically significant transcriptional alterations
specific to ASD, which were enriched for toxic substance response and epigenetic regulation
functions. Differentially-expressed genes in ASD had few overlaps with those identified in cord
blood from newborns with other non-typical neurodevelopmental outcomes in this high-risk
population. Instead, Non-TD-associated genes were enriched for sensory perception functions

and primate-specific genes. Further, coexpression and cell type analyses revealed that
gestational age, birthweight, paternal age, and cell type composition have large impacts on
variability in gene expression measured in whole cord blood.

A strength of this high-risk prospective pregnancy cohort design was the observation of gene
expression at birth, prior to the onset of symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Perinatal life is a
critical period for neurodevelopment, where environmental stressors could have long-term
impact. Additionally, ASD-associated differential expression was meta-analyzed across two
independent studies with harmonized methods and compared with expression changes in other
subjects with non-typical neurodevelopment. Finally, cord blood is an accessible tissue that
reflects the perinatal environment, and ASD-associated gene expression changes in cord blood
may have potential as a predictive biomarker.
