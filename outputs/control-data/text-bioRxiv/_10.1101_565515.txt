that Undermine Controlled HIV-1 Viral Capsid Formation

Abstract
The early and late stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication are orchestrated by
the capsid (CA) protein, which self-assembles into a conical protein shell during viral maturation.
Small molecule drugs known as capsid inhibitors (CIs) impede the highly-regulated activity of
CA. Intriguingly, a few CIs, such as PF-3450074 (PF74) and GS-CA1, exhibit effects at multiple
stages of the viral lifecycle at effective concentrations in the pM to nM regimes, while the majority
of CIs target a single stage of the viral lifecycle and are effective at nM to µM concentrations. In
this work, we use coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms that enable CIs to have such curious broad-spectrum activity. Our quantitatively
analyzed findings show that CIs can have a profound impact on the hierarchical self-assembly of
CA by perturbing the population of small CA oligomers. The self-assembly process is accelerated
by the emergence of alternative assembly pathways that favor the rapid incorporation of CA
pentamers, and leads to increased structural pleomorphism of mature capsids. Two relevant
phenotypes are observed: (1) eccentric capsid formation that may fail to encase the viral genome
and (2) rapid disassembly of the capsid, which express at late and early stages of infection,
respectively. Finally, our study emphasizes the importance of adopting a dynamical perspective
on inhibitory mechanisms and provides a basis for the design of future therapeutics that are
effective at low stoichiometric ratios of drug to protein.

Introduction
Over the last few decades, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1) has made substantial progress.1-3 These advances can be attributed, in part, to the
identification of multiple enzymes that are critical to the HIV-1 lifecycle,4-6 such as reverse
transcriptase, integrase, and protease, as well as the development of small molecules that
competitively inhibit their activities. Current state-of-the-art ARTs consist of a combination
(cART) approach that utilizes multiple drugs, each active against different targets; this strategy is
also referred to as highly-active ART (HAART). Nonetheless, the primary challenges for
HAARTs are to maintain efficacy, safety, and tolerability.1-2 In particular, individual genetic
variation has been responsible for drug resistance in patients.7 Treatment regimens must therefore
adapt to these circumstances, e.g., through the introduction of drugs with alternative mechanisms
of action, since clinically available options are limited.
An emerging class of drugs aims to disrupt the activity of the Gag (group specific antigen)
polyprotein, which is responsible for coordinating the late stages of the viral lifecycle.8-9 The
capsid (CA) domain of Gag is an attractive therapeutic target, since both the assembly and
maturation of infectious viral particles are mediated by interactions between CA protein
domains.10-16 During maturation, for example, CA self-assembles into a conical capsid (i.e., the
mature core), composed of more than one thousand CA monomers, that encases the viral
genome.17-18 Given the functional significance of the CA domain, it is also important to note that
its sequence is highly conserved (around 70%) amongst HIV-1 subtypes, thereby reducing the risk
of viral polymorphism.19-20 Drugs that target CA are known as capsid inhibitors (CIs) and have
been studied for nearly a decade.21-22 Several candidates have been identified that demonstrate the
feasibility of the CI approach, such as Bevirimat and PF-3450074 (PF74), which have half
maximal effective concentrations (EC50), a measure of drug potencies, at nM to µM
concentrations.23-24 Most recently, GS-CA1 was introduced as a promising CI with an EC50 around
85 pM concentration, and targets the same binding pocket as PF74 during early and late stages of
viral infection.25 Nonetheless, a clinically viable CI has yet to appear. A molecular understanding
of the mechanism of action for CIs is currently lacking, and represents a barrier for the
development of new therapeutics.
Perhaps the most extensively studied CI, PF74 serves as a useful example to highlight the
complexity of potential mechanisms for CIs. Initial reports of PF74 have suggested that capsid

destabilization is the primary mechanism of action for the drug.23 Further capsid disassembly
assays have shown that PF74 induces viral uncoating,26-28 although a contradictory study, using
assays at similar concentrations of PF74, observed no discernible effects on viral uncoating and
reverse transcription.29 Interestingly, similar assays that were performed on preassembled CA
tubules have shown that PF74 has a stabilization effect.28,

30-31

Several binding assays have

indicated that PF74 preferentially binds to CA multimers rather than isolated CA,23, 28, 31-32 and
have found that CA assembly rates increase with PF74 present.23, 31 One hypothesis that may
resolve the aforementioned contradiction is that PF74 affects the kinetics of the CA assembly
process, which warrants further investigation. Another hypothesis has also been presented on the
basis of the crystal structure of PF74 in complex with CA hexamers. Since the drug binds to a
pocket at the interface between the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of
adjacent CA monomers,23, 28 PF74 binding may preclude variable curvatures in CA oligomers that
must be adopted for closed capsids. However, since this binding pocket has also been associated
with cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 6 (CPSF6) and nucleoporin 153 kDa (NUP153),
two cellular transport factors that aid nuclear import,33-34 another possibility is that nuclear
integration of the virus is abrogated due to competitive inhibition by PF74.29 Taken together, these
observations suggest that PF74 (and related CIs, such as GS-CA1) can exhibit complex,
multimodal mechanisms of action that target viral maturation, uncoating, reverse transcription, and
nuclear import. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which CIs produce one key aspect
(capsid assembly/disassembly) of such broad activity is the focus of this work.
We use coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations based on prior CG models11
to investigate the impact of CIs on viral infectivity. We hypothesize that the role of CIs is to perturb
the population of small, intermediate oligomers of CA. These effects are implicitly incorporated
into our CG model and used to examine the subsequent implications on late and early stages of the
viral lifecycle. We simulate both capsid assembly and disassembly and emphasize the differences
between the assembly/disassembly pathways in models for both apo and CI-bound capsids. Our
findings suggest that CIs have multiple modes of action by increasing the population of mature
capsids that either (i) fail to enclose viral RNA during maturation or (ii) spontaneously disassemble
before transport and nuclear integration. Furthermore, our study implies that the targeting of CA
oligomers, which requires low stoichiometric loadings of drugs to CA, is a possible design strategy
for future therapeutics.

Results and Discussion
We begin by considering the hierarchical nature of viral capsid assembly, which is
schematically shown in Fig. 1. The capsid is an enclosed protein core that is composed of tiled CA
hexamers with 12 CA pentamers incorporated for topological completeness.17-18 In the cytoplasm,
CA exists in a dynamic equilibrium between CA monomers and dimers.35 Furthermore, the
conformation of CA dimers is inherently dynamic, as depicted in the top row of Fig. 1, and
importantly, only adopts conformations compatible with the mature capsid with 5-10% probability
(i.e., the conformer observed in mature CA hexamers, which is shown in the upper half of the red
box in Fig. 1).36 CA dimers associate during the assembly process to form the final capsid structure.
Prior CG simulations10-11, 37 and a kinetic model38 have shown that a key intermediate is the trimer
of dimers (TOD) structure, depicted in the lower half of the red box in Fig. 1. Three TODs form a
complete CA hexamer that can simultaneously template adjacent hexamers. As CA oligomers
increase in size, there are numerous possible assembly outcomes, including stalled or malformed
assemblies. However, under the precise conditions of weak CA-CA interactions with highlyspecific association interfaces, which are only accessible in a limited manner, the self-assembly
process expresses the characteristic fullerene core morphology.11 These results have suggested that
the nucleation of specific intermediate oligomers is an essential aspect of canonical mature core
assembly. It is also notable that self-assembly is predicted to proceed even in the absence of viral
RNA, which is consistent with recent experiments that have demonstrated mature capsid formation
when co-assembled with inositol phosphate, a small-molecule co-factor.39 The conditions used in
previous simulations implicitly include the putative effects of these co-factors, and the simulations
presented hereafter similarly assume that RNA is not essential for core formation.
To consider the impact of CIs on the CA assembly process, we note that solved
crystallographic structures show evidence that PF74 and GS-CA1 preferentially bind to an interCA pocket between the respective NTD and CTD domains of two adjacent CA monomers.23, 25, 28
Importantly, these pockets only appear when CA oligomerizes, such as in TODs, and appear to
mediate inter-CA interactions, thereby stabilizing multimeric CA.31 We therefore hypothesize that
CIs stabilize the interface between CA domains, increasing the population and/or lifetime of
intermediate oligomers. A natural question to investigate is how these perturbations affect the
overall CA assembly process.

Figure 1. Schematic of the hierarchical process that is central to HIV-1 mature capsid assembly. Within each
oligomeric state of N monomers (N-mer), a variety of configurations are possible. The canonical assembly
pathway relies on constant self-correction across N-mer states, which is contingent on a dynamic and broad
population of small N-mer intermediates. In this work, we effectively introduce the presence of capsid
inhibitor (CI) drugs using a small but fixed population of trimers of dimers, a 6-mer with up to three bound
CIs (one at each dimer-dimer interface), thereby perturbing the natural dynamics of the assembly process.
Snapshots of the final structures from 12 CG-MD simulations are depicted, from which a majority population
of eccentric or malformed capsids can be seen. Here, eccentric (canonical) end-points refer to structures with
regions of densely-accumulated pentamers and defective hexamers (broadly distributed pentamers) while
malformed assemblies are non-enclosed and semi-amorphous structures.

To simulate the influence of CIs, we use the “Ultra-CG” (UCG) model11 that was
previously developed to investigate mature capsid assembly. Briefly, the UCG model consists of
a Cα resolution representation of CA helices with an elastic network model40 (ENM) used to
conserve the tertiary structure of the protein. Select inter-CA contacts that are exposed in the
“mature” configuration are identified from X-ray structures18, 41 and projected as “virtual” CG sites
with two possible states: (1) a non-interacting “inactive” state and (2) an interacting (through an
attractive Gaussian interaction) “active” state. Throughout the simulation, CA dimers periodically
switch between active ([CA+]) and inactive ([CA-]) states and a constant ratio between the two is
maintained. Here, we include the effect of CI binding to CA by introducing a fixed population of
[CA+] that have preassembled into TODs ([CA+]CI), as highlighted by the red box in Fig. 1. We
performed CG MD simulations under conditions that previously resulted in self-regulated
assembly11 ([CA+]/[CA-] = 0.11, [CA] = 4 mM, inert crowder density at 200 mg/ml, UCG state
switching interval at 5×105 timesteps) with [CA+]CI = 0.025, 0.050, 0.075, 0.100, 0.200 and 0.500
mM and 2 replicates for each condition resulting in a total of 12 independent trajectories; note that

[CA+]CI = 0.025 mM represents a single TOD out of a total of 616 CA dimers in a 80 nm length
cubic box. Each simulation was run for 2×109 timesteps (τ) with τ = 10 fs in CG time (which is
not to be confused with actual time). Further details can be found in Methods and in Ref. 11.
The bottom row in Fig. 1 depicts the outcomes of each of the 12 CG simulations. Here, we
qualitatively define three classes of core morphologies for the purposes of the following
discussion: (1) canonical, (2) eccentric, and (3) malformed. Malformed capsids are those with noncontiguous, semi-amorphous lattices, such as when multiple aggregates of CA merge. Canonical
and eccentric capsids refer to contiguous lattices that are distinguished by their curvatures, and
relatedly, their pentamer distributions; in the former case, pentamers are dispersed such that all
pentamers are separated by (at minimum) a hexamer, while the latter case contains adjacent
pentamers in pentamer-dense regions, which also denote regions of high curvature; the need for
this distinction will become evident during the discussion below. From our CG simulations, we
observe 1 canonical, 10 eccentric, and 1 malformed capsid structure. We note that we do not
observe any explicit trends between [CA+]CI and the resultant core morphologies, as summarized
in Table 1, which is likely due to the stochastic nature of the process; additional independent
sampling at each [CA+]CI would be required to confirm a potential trend with respect to [CA+]CI,
but is currently computationally cost prohibitive and outside the scope of this work. Nonetheless,
our simulations suggest that the majority of cores that form due to CIs are highly pleomorphic with
many cores exhibiting large degrees of curvature. This is a notable result when compared to the
expected behavior of WT viruses. Previous cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) surveys of
mature WT virions have revealed a variety of capsid phenotypes, including conical capsids, tubular
capsids, incomplete capsids and dual capsids, although the majority (around 60 to 90%) appears
to be conical.42-44 Our simulations suggest that the presence of CIs shifts this distribution toward
the formation of non-conical cores, which is consistent with cryo-EM images of virions treated by
GS-CA1.25 The distribution of end-point morphologies show that even slight positive perturbation
to TOD populations has profound effects on CA assembly that favor alternative pathways. We
note that this view is conceptually consistent with recent reports of pathway complexity observed
in supramolecular polymers, which emerges when assembly kinetics cannot be described by
simple nucleation-and-elongation models.45-47

To characterize the lattice morphology, we first recognize that the CA lattice can be
represented as a connected graph. One may conceive of each CA monomer as a vertex (v) on a
graph (G) with an edge (e) between vertices signifying their proximal nature. Within the assembled
CA lattice, e represents dimeric CA as well as adjacent intra-capsomer CA; in other words, each v
is ideally connected to three neighboring v within G, which strictly represents the largest assembled
CA lattice. Throughout the simulation trajectories, we use a distance criterion to construct this
graph representation:
(1)
(2)
(3)
with V and E denoting the set of v and e in G, i and j denoting the index of each CA monomer,
dNTD (dCTD) denoting the measured distance between residue V36 (E180) in i and j, and rc denoting
a cutoff distance of 2.5 nm. We then consider a property of graphs known as eccentricity (ecc),
which effectively measures how “far” a given vertex is from its furthest vertex. The ecc of each v
is formally defined as:
(4)
which quantifies the maximum path distance amongst the set of minimum paths between vi and
every other v in V. For our purposes, we consider the normalized ecc (λi = ecc(vi) / max{ecc(v)})
and statistical measures on its distribution (P(λ)) as a metric to classify CA lattice morphologies.

shown; green, red, and blue NTD domains in capsomers indicate hexamers, pentamers, and incomplete
capsomers, respectively.

The utility of P(λ) can be shown with four representative CA lattices (extracted from a
single trajectory) that are analyzed in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) depicts an early stage of CA nucleation in
which the lattice appears largely two-dimensional and isotropic around its six-fold (C6) axis. The
resultant P(λ) exhibits a normal distribution with the smallest (largest) λi associated with the
interior (edges) of the lattice. In Fig. 2(b), the lattice has grown with some edges appearing
“jagged” (a nascent dendrite, in some sense), which is indicative of anisotropic nucleation. The λi
associated with v that participate in these jagged edges is large (e.g., λi > 0.8) in comparison to
interior v; in fact, as these edges become more dendritic, we expect large λi to be increasingly
favored in P(λ). Here, we argue that anisotropic growth at the edges of the CA lattice are relevant
since the branching junction between dendrites may nucleate into pentamers, presumably to anneal
the lattice and to minimize potential strain due to curvature. In Fig. 2(c), the lattice has fully
wrapped into an enclosed 2D lattice, such that all v can be considered interior v. Now, P(λ) favors
a higher population of small λi (e.g., λi < 0.8) with large λi associated with oblong areas of the
capsid; note that pristine cleavage of the capsid, such that the edges are largely composed of
hexamers, recovers a P(λ) with a normal distribution, as seen in Fig. 2(d). This analysis suggests
that we may use the skew of P(λ) (i.e., γ(λ)) to qualitatively classify CA lattice growth; γ(λ) ≈ 0
signifies a lattice with edges that are isotropically distant from the lattice center while γ(λ) < 0
(γ(λ) > 0) represents a lattice with anisotropic edges (with contiguous and uniform oblong
character, such as in complete enclosures).
On the basis of the aforementioned metric, we now analyze time-series profiles from a
subset of the CG trajectories, which were chosen for clarity, in Fig. 3 and compare them to that of
the non-CI case from Ref. 11. We find that in all cases with [CA+]CI > 0, the assembly rate for CA
hexamers (Fig. 3(a)) and pentamers (Fig. 3(b)) is accelerated compared to the [CA+]CI = 0 case.
The observed increase in multimerization rate is consistent with experimental multimerization
assays for PF74,23, 31 and our simulations suggest that CI-bound populations of CA (even at
stoichiometric ratios as low as 1 mol%) can have a profound impact on multimerization rates.
Interestingly, the onset of pentamer incorporation is also notably sooner in the CI-bound cases
(around 50−150×106 τ) compared to the CI-absent case (around 350×106 τ). In all cases, γ(λ), as

seen in Fig. 3(c), is initially close to zero but shifts toward negative values directly preceding the
onset of pentamer incorporation; recall that negative γ(λ) is indicative of non-uniform protrusions
along the lattice edges. The resultant pentamer incorporation typically seems to anneal the lattice
such that γ(λ) increases toward 0 or positive values and the rate of pentamer incorporation is
temporarily suppressed. However, as the edges of the lattice continue to nucleate CA, anisotropic
character may re-emerge and promote the additional incorporation of pentamers. The edges of the
lattice may ultimately anneal to form an enclosed CA lattice (with γ(λ) > 0). Here, CA within
incomplete capsomers, which are likely to be in areas of high curvature, continue to relax until
pentamers are formed, e.g., as evident by the time-series profiles in which pentamer counts
increase while hexamer growth is stalled. Molecular snapshots from a CI-bound case that exhibits
all of these steps are shown in Fig. 3(d).

and accelerated assembly pathway (bottom) through the association of a trimer of dimer (TOD) that is
stabilized by capsid inhibitors (CIs) and a CA dimer. The stars represent potential binding interfaces; yellow
stars indicate the need for an adjacent CA dimer to associate nearly simultaneously, while red stars indicate
sites that are energetically satisfied by a single CA dimer. The topological character of an assembling lattice
over time is quantified by the skew of its eccentricities (γ(λ)) with distributions calculated from a swarm of
50 trajectories in the (b) absence and (c) presence of CIs. Here, γ(λ) ≈ 0 is indicative of an open isotropic
lattice, γ(λ) < 0 is indicative of an open anisotropic lattice, and γ(λ) > 0 is indicative of a uniform and oblong
lattice (such as in closed mature capsids). These results suggest the preference of isotropic (emergence of

anisotropic) lattice growth during canonical (CI-perturbed) assembly, which is highlighted in the region
bound by the dashed red box. Each trajectory was discretized into 20 equal bins before histograms were
computed (n = 375 per histogram).

We interpret these collective results by proposing that CI-bound TODs (i.e., the fixed
TODs in our simulations) accelerate CA assembly by increasing the number of accessible
assembly pathways. First, let us consider that TODs, while important building blocks, still require
free CA dimers (and potentially, other small oligomers) to continue assembly of the CA lattice.11
Each CA dimer favors two binding interfaces that should be satisfied for successful association,
as seen in Fig. 4(a). Hence, continued CA assembly requires the near-simultaneous fastening of
two CA dimers at adjacent edges of the lattice, which subsequently create new edges for future
second-order CA association events. The increased population of TODs, on the other hand, enables
CA lattice growth through the near-simultaneous binding of a TOD and CA dimer. In this
alternative assembly pathway, new binding edges also appear. Yet, it is instead likely that
subsequent assembly steps only require a single CA dimer, as seen in Fig. 4(a), which therefore
accelerates CA assembly.
To demonstrate the emergence of additional assembly paths, we perform 50 short
independent simulations (over 150×106 τ) of CA assembly with [CA+]CI = 0.000 and 0.100 mM
starting from a pre-assembled lattice with 37 CA hexamers (i.e., the equivalent of four concentric
“layers” of hexamers). We depict the progression of γ(λ) in Fig. 4(b-c) and compare the two cases.
In the [CA+]CI = 0.000 mM case (Fig. 4(b)), we find that the majority of trajectories maintain γ(λ)
around 0.0. However, in the [CA+]CI = 0.100 mM case (Fig. 4(c)), a fraction of the trajectories
instead adopt γ(λ) < 0, which is commensurate with increasingly anisotropic lattice growth, with
this fraction increasing as time progresses. This observation is most evident after 50×106 τ has
elapsed; here, states associated with γ(λ) < −0.75 are sampled by CI-bound trajectories while
absent from apo trajectories (see red box in Fig. 4(b)). We therefore suggest that the presence of
CI-bound TODs enables an alternative assembly pathway through enhanced CA association
kinetics and increasingly anisotropic lattice growth.
One consequence of the accelerated CA assembly, and relatedly, the rapid pentamer
incorporation, induced by CIs is that the resultant mature cores may fail to enclose viral RNA for
two reasons. First, the enhanced CA assembly kinetics may preclude the need for viral RNA and
nucleocapsid (NC), i.e., the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, to serve as templates for assembly;
some experiments have suggested that the RNP complex nucleates mature CA assembly,42 which

is further mediated by integrase,43, 48 although this behavior does not appear to be universal as
evident by mature capsid formation even in the absence of an enclosed RNP complex.43-44, 49
Second, CI-perturbed cores are likely to adopt highly curved morphologies with small internal
volumes that may impede the encapsulation of the RNP complex. In our simulations, cores that
underwent full enclosure were observed to contain on the order of 100 hexamers (see Fig. 3(a)).
For comparison, previous accounts from cryo-EM data suggest canonical capsid cores contain on
the order of 200 hexamers. Based on an effective reduction of surface area by a factor of two, we
approximate an associated reduction of internal volume by up to 65% (for simple spherical
geometries). However, we note that RNA condensation, which is likely dependent on salt and viral
protein content, may allow the RNP complex to occupy these reduced volumes; note that such
condensation is suggested by the localization of RNP-associated densities in cryo-EM images
within the broad region of conical mature capsids.42, 49 Nonetheless, the proposed phenotype is
consistent with previous cryo-EM experiments that have observed RNP-associated density outside
that of protein cores, especially those treated with inhibitors.43-44 Hence, our simulations suggest
that one mechanism of action of CIs is to increase the population of eccentric cores that may fail
to enclose the RNP complex.

(with respect to the initial size of the mature capsid core) for the four listed systems as a function of MD
timestep. Three of the eccentric cases exhibit spontaneous disassembly, which appear to be initiated at sites
with large pentamer density. (b) Molecular snapshots of the protein lattice for the 0.075 mM case (orange
line in (a)) at the listed MD timestep (τ [×106]) are shown; green, red, and blue capsomers indicate hexamers,
pentamers, and incomplete capsomers, respectively. This suggests that capsid inhibitors can promote the
formation of ‘leaky’ mature cores that spontaneously open at regions of high curvature (or high pentamer
density), and represents one failure mechanism that suppresses infectivity.

In the event that CI-bound mature cores successfully condense the RNP complex, we also
investigated their viral uncoating behavior. During the post-entry stages of viral infection, capsid
disassembly is highly regulated.6 Although the process is not completely understood, it has been
suggested that certain biological triggers, such as the binding of host cell factors50-52 or the
initiation of reverse transcription,53 act as signals to initiate disassembly. Hence, perturbations to
canonical uncoating behavior may result in reduced infectivity. We simulate putative post-entry
events following the procedures established in Ref. 11 in which we deplete the concentration of
available [CA+] (= 0 mM) and integrate dynamics over 8×108 τ. In Fig. 5, we compare time-series
profiles that depict the fraction of the mature core that persists; here, we select and compare four
closed end-point morphologies from our simulations described above. Interestingly, three out of
four of the selected eccentric cores undergo a step-wise disassembly process, as described by the
processive periods of plateaus and decrements seen in Fig. 5(a). The molecular snapshots depicted
in Fig. 5(b) of an eccentric core during disassembly provide insight into the origins of this behavior.
During the plateau periods, pentamers switch between pentameric states (red in Fig. 5(b)) and that
of an incomplete hexamer (blue in Fig. 5(b)). In this latter state, it is more likely for a CA dimer
to dissociate from the lattice, which has been suggested as the rate-limiting step for viral uncoating.
54

The resultant defect is then the site of spontaneous dissociation of CA. In comparison, we find

that one of the cores remains enclosed, which is evident from the flat profile in Fig. 5(a). This
suggests that within our simulated time-scales, some eccentric cores are inherently stable. In this
case, we find that the regions with large pentamer density are restricted to two adjacent pentamers
at most, and therefore speculate that an increased local density of pentamers (of three or more) is
required for spontaneous uncoating. These results are consistent with fluorescence experiments
that have suggested both WT and PF74-treated viruses contain small populations of cores that fail
to open, while the remaining PF74-treated viral cores have a greater propensity to open
spontaneously.54 Another mechanism of action for CIs may therefore be the production of
eccentric cores that exhibit rapid CA disassembly due to inherent instabilities in high curvature
regions with large pentamer density. Hence, despite the successful assembly of mature cores in the
presence of CIs, accelerated capsid disassembly during the early stages of infection may inhibit
viral infectivity.

On a final note, our simulations demonstrate that a CG model can aid interpretation of the
anomalously broad activity of CIs observed in experiments. In the case of PF74, the binding of
CIs to pre-established binding pockets stabilizes CA multimers in tubular structures and prevents
disassembly.28, 30-31 Our simulations incorporate this stabilization effect with the use of TODs that
are fixed during dynamics. We only consider a low stoichiometric ratio of CI-bound CA given that
experimental EC50 estimates tend to be in the range of µM concentrations or below.23-25 Our results
show that perturbing TOD distributions in this way is sufficient to induce alternative assembly
pathways that yield diverse capsid morphologies, including eccentric cores that were previously
seen as a minority population in WT viruses.42-44 The inherent diversity of these capsids results in
multiple mechanisms of action. Furthermore, these mechanisms appear to be fundamentally
different from that of inhibitors that target monomeric CA, which tend to affect either early or late
(but not both) stages of the viral lifecycle. For example, CAP-1 and CAI bind to CA monomers
and prevent proper CA association at key interfaces (e.g., the CTD dimeric interface) during latestage assembly.55-56 For these types of CIs, higher drug concentrations (e.g. µM or above) may
have been required to ensure that the population of apo CA monomers is sufficiently repressed to
prevent complete assembly. Hence, CIs that target the highly regulated dynamical processes
observed throughout the viral lifecycle by means of CA oligomer subpopulations may have two
primary benefits: (1) broader spectrum inhibitory effects and (2) reduced stoichiometric
requirements that facilitate drug delivery challenges.
Conclusions
In summary, we use CG molecular dynamics simulations and elucidate the mechanisms
underlying the broad-spectrum HIV-1 inhibitory effects of capsid inhibitors (CIs), such as PF74
and GS-CA1, by virtue of small perturbations to the hierarchical self-assembly of viral capsid (CA)
proteins. We find that the primary action of CIs is to stimulate CA association and propagate
anisotropic assembly pathways, which results from the stabilization of a subpopulation of trimer
of dimers (TODs); this behavior is consistent in all of our CG simulations, even at the lowest
accessible drug to CA stoichiometries of less than 1 mol%. Consequently, pentameric defects
appear to be rapidly incorporated, thereby increasing the expression of eccentric cores, that is,
mature cores with inherently large curvature and pleomorphism. Capsids of this phenotype may
unsuccessfully enclose the viral nucleic acid and nucleocapsid protein (RNP) complex, which is

one possible failure mode for infection. However, in the event that the RNP complex is
encapsulated, a secondary failure mode during post-entry events is observed from our capsid
disassembly simulations. Here, regions of the capsid that are dense with pentameric defects appear
to be inherently unstable and initialize CA dissociation; eccentric cores that form due to CIs may
therefore spontaneously disassemble after entry into the cytoplasm. Taken together, our findings
reveal that CIs affect processes during both viral maturation and uncoating. These results also
suggest that the identification of potential binding pockets that appear upon CA oligomerization,
especially those with small degrees of genetic polymorphism, and the design of small molecules
that specifically target these sites – even at low stoichiometric loadings – will facilitate the design
of HIV-1 (and other viral) inhibitors with similarly broad mechanisms of action.
Methods
Coarse-grained modeling and simulation. As mentioned above, the CG models used in this
work are described in Ref.

11

. Our simulations contained CA, pre-assembled TODs and inert

crowding agents, as described in the main text, which were initially dispersed randomly within the
periodic simulation box. Configurations were allowed to equilibrate over 5×106 τ without any
attractive interactions. Production runs were then performed as described in the main text, while
[CA+]/[CA-] UCG state switching was attempted every 5×105 τ. All simulations were performed
in the constant NVT ensemble at 300 K using a Langevin thermostat57 with a damping period of
100 ps and τ = 10 fs. All simulations were run using an in-house MD engine called UCG-MD,
which is optimized to run implicit-solvent UCG simulations with dynamic load-balancing and
runtime algorithms.58 Neighbor lists up to 4 nm with an additional 1 nm skin depth were used,
while load balancing was attempted every 2×104 τ. Molecular snapshots were saved every 1×106
τ for analysis.
Data analysis. Graph analysis was performed using the python package NetworkX 2.1
(http://networkx.github.io/). A graph was constructed for each molecular snapshot following the
criteria described in the main text. Hexamers and pentamers were identified by vertices (i.e., CA
monomers) that participated in a closed cycle of length six and five, respectively. The remaining
nodes were identified as components of incomplete capsomers. The λ of each vertex was computed
using the eccentricity function.
