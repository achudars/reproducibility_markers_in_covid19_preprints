
Abstract— Objective: To develop a new fMRI network
inference method, BrainNET, that utilizes an efficient machine
learning algorithm in a specialized way to quantify contributions
of various regions of interests (ROIs) in the brain to a specific ROI
to estimate the network.
Methods: BrainNET is based on Extremely Randomized Trees
(ERT) to estimate network topology from fMRI data and modified
to generate an adjacency matrix representing brain network
topology, without reliance on arbitrary thresholds. Open source
simulated fMRI data of fifty subjects in twenty-eight different
simulations under various confounding conditions with known
ground truth was used to validate the method. Performance was
compared with Pearson correlation. The real-world performance
was then evaluated in a publicly available Attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) dataset including 135
Typically Developing Children (mean age: 12.00, males: 83), 75
ADHD Inattentive (mean age: 11.46, males: 56) and 93 ADHD
Combined (mean age: 11.86, males: 77) subjects. Network
topologies were inferred using BrainNET and Pearson correlation.
Graph metrics were extracted to determine differences between
ADHD groups. An extension to BrainNET was also developed (BCorr) in which BrainNET adjacency matrix is combined with
Pearson correlation output to remove false positives.
Results: BrainNET demonstrated excellent performance across
all simulations and varying confounders. It achieved significantly
higher accuracy and sensitivity than Pearson correlation (p<0.05).
In ADHD dataset, BrainNET was able to identify significant
changes (p< 0.05) in graph metrics between groups. No significant
changes in graph metrics between ADHD groups was identified
using Pearson correlation. The B-Corr method provided similar
results to BrainNET.

I. INTRODUCTION
The brain is a complex interconnected network that balances
segregation and specialization of function with strong
integration between regions, resulting in complex and precisely
coordinated dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales
[1]. Connectomics and graph theory offer powerful tools for
mapping, tracking, and predicting patterns of disease in brain
disorders through modelling brain function as complex
networks [2]. Studying brain network organization provides
insight in understanding global network connectivity
abnormalities in neurological and psychiatric disorders [3].
Several studies suggest that pathology accumulates in highly
connected hub areas of the brain [4, 5] and that cognitive
sequelae are closely related to the connection topology of the
affected regions [6]. An understanding of network topology
may allow prediction of expected levels of impairment,
determination of recovery following an insult and selection of
individually tailored interventions for maximizing therapeutic
success [7]. A large number of network inference methods are
being used to model brain network topology with varying
degrees of validation. A recent study [8] evaluated some of the
most common methods, including correlation, partial
correlation, and Bayes NET, to infer network topology using
simulated resting state functional magnetic resonance images
(fMRI) data with known ground truth and found that
performance can vary widely under different conditions.
Development of statistical techniques for valid inferences on
disease-specific group differences in brain network topology is
an active area of research. Machine learning methods have been
used in neuroimaging for disease diagnosis and anatomic
segmentation [9]. Very few studies have attempted to apply
machine learning methods to infer brain networks [9-12].

the ERT regressor. Node Importance of each node for predicting the target node are extracted and populated in the importance

Recent work in machine learning approaches for inference of
Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN) have demonstrated good
performance [13-15]. Interestingly, these same approaches to
gene regulatory networks can be used to infer brain networks.
In this study, we describe a new network inference method
called BrainNET, inspired by machine learning methods used
to infer GRN [16].
Validation of BrainNET was performed using fMRI
simulations with known ground, as well as in real-world ADHD
fMRI datasets. In this study, publicly available resting state
fMRI simulated data [8] was used to validate BrainNET’s
ability to infer networks. The real-world performance of
BrainNET was then evaluated in a publicly available data set of
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is
one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in
children with significant socioeconomic and psychological
effects [17, 18] and is very difficult to diagnose [19]. ADHD
has widespread but often subtle alterations in multiple brain
regions affecting brain function [20, 21] [19, 22] [23-25]. Neuro
Bureau, a collaborative neuroscience forum, has released fully
processed open source fMRI data “ADHD-200 preprocessed”
from several sites [26, 27] providing an ideal dataset to test the
BrainNET model and compare its performance with standard
Pearson correlation.

upon
the dynamic
causal
modelling fMRI forward model, which uses the non-linear
balloon model for vascular dynamics, in combination with
a neural network model [8]. The open source dataset has 28
simulations; each including simulated data for 50 subjects with
varying number of nodes and several confounders (e.g., shared
input between the nodes, varying fMRI session lengths, noise,
cyclic connections and hemodynamic lag variability changes).
Additional details on the simulations can be found in the
original study [8].
ADHD data: Preprocessed rs-fMRI data were obtained from
the
ADHD-200
database
(http://fcon
1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/). Seven different sites
contributed to the ADHD-200 database for 776 rs-fMRI data
acquisitions. The data was preprocessed using the Athena
pipeline and was provided in 3D NifTI format. Additional
information on the Athena pipeline and “ADHD 200
preprocessed” data is detailed by Bellec et al [26].
In our study, subjects identified with ‘No Naïve medication’
status, or questionable quality on rs-fMRI data were excluded.
The remaining subjects were age-matched between the groups
resulting in 135 Typically Developing Children (TDC) (mean
age: 12.00, males: 83), 75 ADHD Inattentive (ADHD-I) (mean
age: 11.46, males: 56) and 93 ADHD Combined (ADHD-C)
(mean age: 11.86, males: 77) subjects. Mean time series from
116 ROI’s in the AAL atlas [28] were extracted using the
NILEARN package [29].

nodes), where edges between the nodes represent the true
functional connectivity between nodes. At each node, there are
measurements
from

points
𝑋 =
{ 𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , 𝑥3 , 𝑥4 , … . , 𝑥𝑁 }, where xi is the vector representation of
m time points measured as
𝑥𝑖 = (𝑥𝑖1 ,
𝑥𝑖2 ,
𝑥𝑖3 ,
𝑥𝑖4 , … ,
𝑥𝑖𝑚 )𝑇 .
Our method assumes that fMRI measurement of BOLD (Blood
Oxygen Level Dependent) activation at each node is a function
of each of the other nodes’ activation with additional random
noise.
For the jth node with m time points, a vector can be defined
denoting all nodes except the jth node as

nodes. Then, the decrease in impurity ΔImpurity(S) from node
split “S” based on Nodej to predict Nodei is defined as
ΔImpurⅈty(S𝑖𝑗 ) = Impurⅈty(S) – (N𝐿 /N𝑃 ) ∗ Impurⅈty (S𝐿 )
− (N𝑅 /N𝑃 ) ∗ Impurⅈty (S𝑅 )
where, SL and SR are left and right splits and NP, NL, NR are
number of samples reaching parent, left and right nodes
respectively. Let 𝕍k be the number of ensembles, which uses
ROIj for splitting trees. Then, the importance score for Node j
for predicting Nodei is calculated as the average of node
impurities across all trees, i.e. Importance of ROIji
I(ⅈ, j) = ∑G∈𝕍k ΔImpurⅈty (S𝑖𝑗 )/T

𝑥−𝑗 = (𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , 𝑥𝑗−1 , 𝑥𝑗+1 , … . . , 𝑥𝑁 ), then the measurements
at the jth node can be represented as a function of other nodes as
𝑥𝑗 = 𝑓𝑗 (𝑥−𝑗 ) + Ɛ𝑗
where Ɛj is random noise specific to each nodej. We further
assume that function ƒj () only exploits the data of nodes in x-j
that are connected to nodej. The function ƒj () can be solved in
various ways in the context of machine learning. Since the
nature of the relationship between different ROIs in the brain is
unknown and expected to be non-linear [30], we choose a tree
based ensemble method as it works well with a large number of
features with non-linear relationships and is computationally
efficient. We utilized Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT), an
ensemble algorithm similar to Random Forest, which
aggregates several weak learners to form a robust model. ERT
uses a random subset of predictors to select divergences in a
tree node and then selects the “best split” from this limited
number of choices [31]. Finally, outputs from individual trees
are averaged to obtain the best overall model [32]. BrainNET
infers a network with N different nodes by dividing the problem
into N different sub problems, and solving the function ƒj () for
each node independently as illustrated in Figure 1. The steps are
listed below:
For j = 1 to N nodes
 Fit the ERT regressor with all the nodes data, except
the jth node, to find the function fj that minimizes the
following mean squared error:
m

1/𝑚 ∑ (xj − fj (x−j ))

2

k=1



Extract the weight of each node to predict node j,
w
W(j, n) = { 𝑛
0



ⅈf n ≠ j
ⅈf n = j

where wn is the weight of node to predict node j and
n= 1 to N.
Append the weights values to the Importance matrix

The importance score for each node (Nodej) to predict (Nodei)
is defined as the total decrease in impurity due to splitting the
samples based on Nodej [31]. Let “S” denote a node split in the
tree ensemble and let (SL, SR) denote its left and right children

where T is the number of trees in the ensemble.
Importance values extracted using a typical Random Forest
model can be biased in the presence of two or more correlated
features since the model will randomly assign importance to
any one of the equally important features without any
preference [33]. This problem is avoided by using the ERT
regressor.
The importance of each node to predict all other node time
series is extracted from the model and an NxN (where N is the
number of nodes) importance matrix is generated with the
diagonal equal to zero. Each row of the importance matrix
represents normalized weights of each node in predicting the
target node. The extracted adjacency matrix is affected in two
ways. First, due to the row-wise normalization, the upper
triangular values of the importance matrix are not same as the
lower triangle values. We therefore take the average of the
upper triangle and the lower triangle of the matrix to make it
symmetric to determine the presence of connection between the
nodes. This procedure does not allow directionality of the
connections to be determined. Second, again because of the
row-wise normalization, the sum of each row in the importance
matrix is one. Since the importance values are normalized with
respect to number of nodes in the analysis, we used a threshold
equal to a theoretical probability value that is inversely
proportional to the number of nodes (i.e., threshold = 1/number
of nodes) in the network to produce a final adjacency matrix
representing the network topology. This results in a
dynamically changing threshold based on the number of nodes
in the network.
C. Analysis
Network topologies were inferred in the rs-fMRI simulation
data using BrainNET. The average of the network estimation
across the 50 simulated subjects in each simulation was
compared against the ground truth to calculate accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity for BrainNET and Pearson
correlation. In the Pearson correlation method, pairwise
similarity between the nodes was calculated to create a
correlation matrix [8]. A combined method called B-Corr was
also created, by masking the Pearson correlation matrix with the
adjacency matrix derived from BrainNET. The output from BCorr will have nodes determined by BrainNET, with Pearson
correlation values assigned between the connections. This will
allows analysis of connectivity changes between nodes, which
cannot be performed with an adjacency matrix alone derived

threshold for the BrainNET method we False Positive Rates

simulations which has same confounder except number of
nodes (Fig.2).
After validating BrainNET on the simulated data, we applied it
to the real-world ADHD data to evaluate whole brain network
changes in ADHD subtypes (i.e., ADHD-Combined (ADHDC), ADHD Inattentive (ADHD-I) compared to Typically
Developing Children (TDC). The conventional Pearson
correlation and B-Corr method were also used on the same
dataset to infer fMRI networks. The BrainNET model was
applied to extract an importance matrix for each subject. The
importance matrix was then thresholded at 1/number of nodes
(e.g., 1/116 for the AAL atlas regions) to obtain an adjacency
matrix for each subject (AdjImp). Functional Network
connectivity was calculated between the 116 ROIs using
Pearson correlation and thresholded at a correlation coefficient
of 0.2 (AdjCorr) This threshold was determined based on a

sensitivity threshold analysis (Fig.3). The B-Corr adjacency
matrix (AdjB-corr) was derived by masking the correlation matrix
(AdjCorr) with the adjacency matrix of BrainNET (Adj Imp).
Graph theoretic metrics were extracted using each of these
methods for each group. Network differences between the three
groups TDC, ADHD-I and ADHD-A were then computed using
t-tests on the graph metrics.
Graph Metrics: Graph theoretical metrics representing global
and local characteristics of network topology were used to
compare between the groups in the ADHD dataset. The
Networkx package in python was used to extract the graph
theoretical metrics including Density, Average Clustering
Coefficient and Characteristic Path length [34]. Density of the
graph is defined as the ratio of number connection in the
network to the number of possible connection in the network.
Average Clustering is the fraction of a node's neighbors that are
neighbors of each other. The clustering coefficient of a graph is
the average clustering coefficient (ACC) over all nodes in the
network. Networks with a high clustering coefficient are
considered locally efficient networks. Characteristic Path

The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each method
across all 28 simulated data sets is presented in Table 1.
BrainNET achieved higher accuracy and sensitivity in all the
simulations compared to the correlation method as shown in
Fig.4. The overall accuracy and sensitivity of BrainNET for
the 28 simulations was significantly higher than that Pearson
correlation method with p-values of 0.0009 and 0.0001
respectively. BrainNET achieved an accuracy of 94.69 %,
sensitivity of 96.31% and specificity of 88.02 %, whereas the
Pearson correlation method achieved 90.03%, 89.79% and
90.35%, respectively across the 28 simulations. Although the
specificity of the BrainNET’s method was lower than the

specificity performance. BrainNET demonstrated significantly
increased performance in terms of accuracy and sensitivity
with a tradeoff of slightly lower specificity. The BrainNET
threshold analysis is presented in Figure 2. Use of a threshold
value inversely proportional to the number of nodes did not
increase the False Positive rates (FPR).
B. Comparison of BrainNET and Pearson Correlation on
ADHD Data
BrainNET was able to identify significant changes (p < 0.05) in
brain network topology in graph metrics in the ADHD data.
Significant increase and decrease of CPL and density were
demonstrated respectively in between TDC and ADHD,
between TDC and any ADHD subtypes, and between ADHDC and ADHD-I subtypes (Table.2). There is no significant
changes in AC between the groups. Pearson correlation was not
able to detect significant changes in any of the above whole
brain analyses. The B-Corr method provided similar results to
the BrainNET model.

IV. DISCUSSION
BrainNET is based on ERT [35] to generate an importance
matrix. The ERT regressor is used to develop a tree based
ensemble model to predict each node’s time series from all
other node time series. The tree based ensemble methods are
ideal for inferring complex functional brain networks as they
are efficient in learning non-linear patterns even where there are
a large number of features [36]. The importance matrix is then
thresholded to generate an adjacency matrix representing the
fMRI topology. The BrainNET model is applicable to both
resting-state and task-based fMRI network analysis. It can be
easily adapted to datasets with varying session length and can
be used with different parcellation schemes. A unique feature
of the BrainNET approach is that it is implemented at the
subject level. It does not need to be trained on big datasets as it
infers the network topology based on each individual subject’s
data.
A. BrainNET Inference of Network Topology in Simulated
fMRI Data
BrainNET demonstrated excellent performance across all the
simulations and varying confounders. It achieved significantly
higher accuracy and sensitivity than Pearson correlation
(p<0.05). BrainNET performance remained high in the
simulations across varying session lengths, number of nodes,
neural lags, cyclic connections, and changing number of
connections. Even for the simulations in which only one node
had much higher activation signal than the other nodes
(simulation 24), the model achieved 84% accuracy and 85.3%
sensitivity. BrainNET performance was weakest for Simulation
11. In this simulation, there are 10 nodes, and each node shares
a relatively small amount of the other node time series in a
proportion of 0.8:0.2. Since the features have shared data
between the nodes in this simulation, it limits discrimination of
true connectivity between nodes. BrainNET still outperformed
the correlation method in Simulation 11. The sharing of data
between nodes can be minimized in fMRI analysis by selecting
independent regions using anatomical parcellation or methods

such as ICA. In simulation 13, the nodes had many indirect
connections. The correlation method performed poorly,
identifying many false positives (specificity of only 45%),
whereas BrainNET achieved a specificity of 86% with higher
accuracy and sensitivity compared to the correlation method. In
simulation 16, the nodes were simulated to have a greater
number of connections. BrainNET specificity dropped to
75.43% while maintaining high accuracy and sensitivity. This
suggests that the ability of BrainNET to find all the connections
in highly connected hub nodes may be affected.
Thresholding the importance matrix can change the network
topology drastically. Thresholding can be applied to suppress
spurious connections that may arise from measurement noise
and imperfect connectome reconstruction techniques and to
potentially improve statistical power and interpretability [7].
However, based on the threshold value, the connection density
of each network may vary from network to network after the
threshold has been applied. This can lead to wide variability in
computed graph metrics, as they are typically very sensitive to
the number of edges in a graph. Identifying an appropriate
threshold to infer the underlying brain network topology is
critical. In the BrainNET model, as the number of nodes
increases, the importance value also decreases as it is
normalized across all the nodes in a row. Our choice of
threshold for BrainNET is [1/ (number of nodes)], represents a
theoretical probability for the presence of connection between
the nodes. One concern with this approach is that as the number
of nodes increases, the threshold similarly decreases, and may
result in increased false positives at this low threshold value.
We performed a specificity analysis to determine the false
positive rate as the number of nodes increases. The false
positive rate actually improved with increasing number of
nodes (Figure 2), showing that the decreased threshold value
does not affect the performance of BrainNET.
A major strength of the BrainNET approach is that it provides
a unique threshold to determine the true network topology. In
correlation-based approaches, there is no defined correlation

cutoff to determine the true network topology. Rather, multiple
approaches are employed, or multiple thresholds applied to
generate different networks. Typically, the network cost has
been used to define the cutoff value for defining true
connections in correlation-based approaches [37]. Multiple
costs are then applied to generate multiple instances of the
network topology, and analyses are performed to determine the
variation in network metrics across these costs, or variation in
group differences across thresholds [38]. The BrainNET
approach provides a single threshold obviating the need for
these imprecise and convoluted thresholding approaches.
B. Evaluation on ADHD Data
BrainNET was able to identify statistically significant changes
in graph metrics between ADHD subjects and typically
developing children. The correlation method failed to identify
differences in any of the groups with any statistical significance
(Table.2). The BrainNET results were similar across ADHD
groups and TDC. There was a decrease in density and an
increase in CPL in ADHD compared to TDC. Decrease in
density suggests that the number of connections is decreased in
ADHD. This can be interpreted as an increase in the cost of
wiring in the brain. The increase in CPL is expected given that
there is a decrease in density and suggests that there is increased
difficulty in transferring information across the brain in ADHD.
The trends in the graph metrics using the correlation method do
not convey much information and the interpretation may be
misleading as none was even close to significance. The B-corr
method, however, which is the combination of correlation and
BrainNET, showed significant changes between all groups
similar to BrainNET. Previous studies have shown that ADHD
is often associated with changes in functional organization of
the brain [18, 21]. BrainNET analysis of ADHD data supports
the notion that functional organization of brain changes in
ADHD, and it was effective in identifying the subtle changes in
the ADHD subjects.

V. CONCLUSION
We describe BrainNET, a new network inference method to
estimate fMRI connectivity that was adapted from Gene
Regulatory methods. We validated the proposed model on
ground truth simulation data [8]. BrainNET outperformed
Pearson correlation in terms of accuracy and sensitivity across
simulations and various confounders such as the presence of
cyclic connections, and even with truncated fMRI sessions of
only 2.5 min. We also describe a method of thresholding
correlation-based networks using the BrainNET results (BCorr). We evaluated the performance of BrainNET on the open
source “ADHD 200 preprocessed” data from Neuro Bureau.
BrainNET and B-Corr were both able to identify significant
changes in global graph metrics between ADHD groups and
TDC, whereas correlation alone was unable to find any
differences. BrainNET can be used independently or combined
with other existing methods as an effective tool to understand
