Abstract

19

Introduction: Multimorbidity associated with significant disease and economic burdens

20

is common among the aged. We identified chronic disease multimorbidity patterns in Koreans 50

21

years of age or older, and explored whether such patterns were associated with particular

22

sociodemographic factors and health-related quality-of-life.

23

Methods: The multimorbidity patterns of 10 chronic diseases (hypertension, dyslipidemia,

24

stroke, osteoarthritis, tuberculosis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, depression, diabetes mellitus, and

25

thyroid disease) were identified via latent class analysis of data on 8,370 Korean adults aged 50+

26

years who participated in the sixth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

27

(2013-2015). The associations between multimorbidity patterns, and sociodemographic factors

28

and health-related quality of life, were subjected to regression analysis.

29

Results: Three patterns of multimorbidity were identified: 1) a relatively healthy group

30

(60.4% of the population); 2) a ‘cardiometabolic conditions’ group (27.8%); and, 3) an ‘arthritis,

31

asthma, allergic rhinitis, depression, and thyroid disease’ group (11.8%). The female (compared

32

to male) gender was associated with an increased likelihood of membership of the cardiometabolic

33

conditions group (odds ratio [OR]=1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.15-1.51) and (to a much

34

greater extent) the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group (OR=4.32,

35

95% CI=3.30-5.66). Low socioeconomic status was associated with membership of the two

36

multimorbidity classes. Membership of the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid

disease group was associated with a significantly poorer health-related quality-of-life than was

membership of the other two groups.

Conclusion: The co-occurrence of chronic diseases was not attributable to chance.

40

Multimorbidity patterns were associated with sociodemographic factors and quality-of-life. Our

41

results suggest that targeted, integrated public health and clinical strategies dealing with chronic

42

diseases should be based on an understanding of multimorbidity patterns; this would improve the

43

quality-of-life of vulnerable multimorbid adults.

Introduction

46

Given aging populations, advances in medical care and public health policies, and

47

improved living conditions, the co-occurrence of two or more chronic diseases in the same

48

individual (multimorbidity) [1,2] is increasingly common [3-5]. A recent study of Koreans adults

49

aged 50 and older found that more than one in four were multimorbid [6]. Multimorbidity is a

50

public health concern, being associated with higher mortality, impaired functional status, a reduced

51

quality-of-life, increased healthcare utilization, and a greater treatment burden [7-14]. The impact

52

of multimorbidity can be much more complex (being synergistic) than the impact of individual

53

diseases; health outcomes may differ by the disease combinations in play [3,15,16]. Thus, current

54

single-disease-oriented public health strategies and clinical healthcare guidelines may be both

55

incomplete and ineffective for multimorbid patients [17].

56

Certain chronic diseases tend to co-occur more often than expected by chance because they

57

share pathophysiological pathways [18,19]. Identification of patterns of disease combinations and

58

the characteristics of individuals exhibiting similar multimorbidity patterns may provide important

59

information for policymakers and clinicians who seek to integrate strategic public health policy

60

plans and healthcare management to address multimorbidity in at-risk groups more effectively.

61

Even though multimorbidity has attracted increasing attention (because it is becoming the norm in

62

the elderly; [17,20-25]), we still do not know how multiple chronic diseases cluster, the associated

63

socioeconomic factors, and how multimorbidity affects quality-of-life.

64

Multimorbidity is highly complex. The use of a statistical approach to group a population

65

into a limited number of subgroups with similar combinations of chronic diseases is much more

66

practical than analysis of every possible disease combination. Therefore, we performed latent class

67

analysis (LCA) based on the hypothesis that certain chronic diseases cluster. LCA identifies

68

probabilistic rather than deterministic subgroups based on responses to a set of observed variables,

69

and assumes that the pattern is explained by unobserved categorical latent variables of K classes

70

[26,27]. Our objectives were: 1) to identify multimorbidity patterns in the general Korean

71

population aged over 50 years using nationally representative survey data; and, 2) to explore

72

whether such patterns were associated with certain sociodemographic characteristics and quality-

73

of-life.

Methods

77

Data source and sample

78

We used data on adults 50 years of age and older who participated in the sixth Korean

79

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted in 2013-2015.

80

KNHANES is a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of the noninstitutionalized

81

Korean population conducted by the Division of Chronic Disease Surveillance, Korea Centers for

82

Disease Control and Prevention (KCDCP). KNHANES uses a stratified, multistage cluster

83

sampling method based on geographical area, gender, and age. The details have been described

84

previously [28].

85
86

Measures

87

Chronic disease was based on self-reports, on whether participants had ever been

88

physician-diagnosed with any disease on a pre-specified list. Analysis was limited to the 10 most

89

common chronic diseases (hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, osteoarthritis, tuberculosis, asthma,

90

allergic rhinitis, depression, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease; the prevalence of each is greater

91

than 3% [29-31]) of the 28 diseases listed in the KNHANES. Multimorbidity was defined as the

92

presence of two or more of these diseases in the same subject.

93

The sociodemographic variables evaluated included age, gender, household income,

94

educational level, and occupation. The household income was the monthly income divided by the

95

square root of household size [32], and was grouped into high and low using the median income

96

as the cut-off. Educational level was categorized as low for those younger than 70 years who were

97

high school graduates or less accomplished, and for those older than 70 years who were middle

98

school graduates or less accomplished. In terms of occupational status, students and housewives

99

were defined as unemployed; service workers. retailers, agriculture or fishery employees,

100

technicians, mechanics, assemblers, and simple laborers were defined as manual workers; and

101

managers, professionals, and office workers were considered to be non-manual workers. The

102

health-related quality of life was assessed using the EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument;

103

this is a generic measure of health status. The EQ-5D features five dimensions (mobility, self-care,

104

engagement in usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression); each dimension has three

105

response options (1 = no problem, 2 = some problems, and 3 = a severe problem). The health-

106

related quality of life was scored as a single value (the EQ-5D index score) using a validated

107

algorithm [33,34].

108
109

Statistical analysis

110

Disease prevalence, disease co-occurrence in the multimorbid, and the number of co-

111

occurring diseases for each disease, were calculated. We used LCA to explore multimorbidity

112

patterns. The optimal number of latent classes was determined based on the lowest Consistent

113

Akaike Information Criterion (CAIC) and the adjusted Bayesian-Schwarz Information Criterion

114

(adjusted BIC) [35-37], clinical significance, and interpretability [38]. After selection of an optimal

115

model, each respondent was assigned to the class for which s/he had the highest computed

116

membership probability. An average posterior probability greater than 70% indicates an optimal

117

fit [39]. The characteristics of respondents in different latent classes were compared using the chi-

118

squared test for categorical variables and ANOVA for continuous variables. In addition,

119

multinomial logistic regression was performed to assess the association between each

120

sociodemographic factor (age, gender, household income, educational level, and occupation) and

121

latent class membership. Associations were assessed using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence

122

intervals (CIs). Each association was adjusted in terms of the other variables in the multivariate

123

analysis. Regression analysis (using SAS PROC SURVEYREG) was performed to assess whether

124

the health-related quality of life varied by latent class membership. The least square mean of the

125

EQ-5D index score (with the 95% CI) was estimated for each latent class. The adjusted model

126

considered gender, age, household income, educational level, and occupation. Bonferroni post-hoc

127

testing was performed after all pairwise comparisons. As the EQ-5D index score is not normally

128

distributed, it was log-transformed prior to analysis and then back-transformed. All tests were two-

129

tailed, and a p-value <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were

130

performed with the aid of SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). All estimates

131

were subjected to sample weighting to reflect the complexity of the KNHANES sampling design.

132
133

Ethics

134

The KNHANES was approved by the institutional review board of the KCDCP (approval

135

nos. 2013-07CON-03-4C, 2013-12EXP-03-5C, and 2015-01-02-6C). Written informed consent

136

was obtained from all participants.

138

Results

139

A total of 8,370 participants aged over 50 years were included in analysis. The mean age

140

was 62.5 years, and 46% were male. Of all respondents, 39% had two or more chronic diseases;

141

the mean number of chronic diseases in multimorbid subjects was 2.6. Table 1 lists the prevalence

142

and the proportions of multimorbidity, and the average number of comorbid diseases for each of

143

the 10 chronic diseases included in the analysis. Hypertension (36.4%), dyslipidemia (22.1%),

144

osteoarthritis (19.8%), and diabetes mellitus (14.4%) were the most prevalent diseases and at least

145

one of the 10 diseases existed as a multimorbidity in over 60% of multimorbid patients; stroke

146

occurred in 87.1% (the highest) and tuberculosis in 63.2% (the lowest). The number of co-

147

occurring diseases varied between 2.2 and 2.9 depending on the index disease. Table 2 summarizes

148

the LCA model fits. When up to four latent classes were considered, the smallest adjusted BIC

149

(two-class model: 929.18; three-class: 797.28; four-class: 801.36) and CAIC (two-class model:

150

1016.91; three-class: 930.97; four-class: 981.01) were those of the three-class model; these classes

151

were relatively healthy, those with cardiometabolic conditions, and those with arthritis, asthma,

152

allergic rhinitis, depression, and thyroid disease as revealed by the estimated probabilities of any

153

particular chronic disease given membership of a latent class. Every respondent was assigned to

154

one of the three classes based on the highest membership probability. The relatively healthy group

155

included those with a low prevalence of all evaluated chronic conditions. The dyslipidemia

156

response probabilities were very similar for the two multimorbid groups but dyslipidemia was

157

classified as a cardiometabolic condition based on the clinical nature of the disease; thus, the

158

cardiometabolic conditions group was populated by those with high probabilities of hypertension,

159

dyslipidemia, stroke, and diabetes mellitus. The class membership probabilities were 60.4, 27.8,

160

and 11.8% respectively, and the average posterior probabilities for all three classes exceeded 70%

161

(Table 3). The mean age of the cardiometabolic conditions group was the highest (67 years) but

162

the mean number of co-occurring chronic conditions was highest (2.9) in the arthritis, asthma,

allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group. Both the cardiometabolic conditions group (40.2%

164

male vs. 59.8% female) and the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group

165

had higher proportions of females (17.7 vs. 82.3%); males constituted over 50% of the relatively

166

healthy group (51.4 vs. 48.6%). In particular, most subjects were female in the arthritis, asthma,

167

allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group (82.3%). Socioeconomic status was similar in the

168

cardiometabolic conditions group and the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid

169

disease group; both groups evidenced higher proportions (compared to the overall figures) of

170

individuals with lower household incomes, lower levels of education, and of unemployed status

(Table 4).

Multinomial logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, educational level,

185

household income, and occupation showed that age increased the risk of being in either of the

186

multimorbid groups compared to the relatively healthy group. The risks of membership of the

187

cardiometabolic conditions group (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.15-1.51) and the arthritis, asthma,

188

allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group (OR=4.32, 95% CI=3.30-5.66) were significantly

189

higher for females than males. Lower household income (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.14-1.52) and lower

190

educational level (OR=1.25, 95% CI=1.05-1.49) significantly increased the risk of membership of

191

the cardiometabolic conditions group. In addition, unemployed status increased the risk of

192

membership of both the cardiometabolic conditions group and the arthritis, asthma, allergy,

193

depression, and thyroid disease group (Table 5).

Discussion

215

We used LCA to identify three distinct multimorbidity patterns in the general Korean

216

population: (1) a relatively healthy group; (2) a group with cardiocerebrovascular conditions
17

217

including hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, and diabetes mellitus; and, (3) a group with arthritis,

218

asthma, allergic rhinitis, depression, and thyroid disease. We found that individuals of the three

219

classes exhibited different sociodemographic characteristics and varied in terms of health-related

220

quality of life. It is difficult to directly compare our results to those of previous studies given the

221

methodological differences in terms of study setting, disease spectrum and number, demographic

222

factors, baseline health status of participants, and the statistical methods used [29], but the

223

multimorbidity patterns we identified are in general agreement with those of prior works. Such

224

similarities may indicate that chronic diseases aggregate because they share underlying risk factors

225

(so one disease increases the risk of another) or that causalities are shared [19]. We found that

226

hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, and diabetes mellitus were very likely to co-occur, as have

227

several prior studies evaluating subjects with (predominantly) cardiocerebrovascular conditions

228

[17,19,21,40-42]. It is known that hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus are risk factors

229

for cerebrovascular diseases, and may precede such diseases [43-46]. Although the mechanism

230

behind the combination of arthritis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, depression, and thyroid disease

231

remains unclear, similar groupings were evident in other studies. Arthritis and depression were co-

232

grouped by Simoes et al. [19], asthma and allergy by Larsen et al. [47], and arthritis, respiratory

233

diseases, and psychiatric symptoms formed a latent class in the work of Islam [17,42].

234

Most previous studies on multimorbidity used a non-model approach such as counts of the

235

most common disease combinations and their observed-to-expected ratios [48-50]; such methods

236

are too simplistic. Recently, several studies have used statistical approaches such as cluster

237

analysis [31,51,52], factor analysis [21,25,40,41], and LCA [17,22,36,42,53-55] to identify

238

nonrandom multimorbidity clusters. We used LCA to identify subgroups based on structural

239

equation modeling [56]. LCA is better than conventional clustering because LCA employs

240

probability-based classification methods to choose an optimal number of classes based on various

241

diagnostic tests [27,57]. This allowed us to group individuals into a limited number of latent classes

242

and then analyze the differences between the classes. Our analysis not only indicated what other

243

diseases were likely to co-occur in subjects with certain diseases but also allowed us to explore

244

whether individuals with certain sociodemographic characteristics were more vulnerable to

245

multimorbidity and the associated adverse health outcomes. The multimorbid groups were of lower

246

socioeconomic status than the relatively healthy group. Individuals with cardiometabolic

247

conditions were older than individuals in the relatively healthy and the arthritis, asthma, allergy,

248

depression, and thyroid disease groups. In addition, a remarkable female predominance was

249

evident in the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group. Female

250

predominance in a musculoskeletal class and a headache-mental illness class was noted by Larsen

251

et al. [47].

252

Furthermore, we found that older age, being female, and lower socioeconomic status

253

increased the risk of membership of the cardiometabolic conditions group and/or the arthritis,

254

asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group, as compared to the relatively healthy

255

group. In particular, being female increased the risk of membership of the arthritis, asthma,

256

allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group more than four-fold; also, individuals assigned to

257

this latent class had a lower quality-of-life and were younger than members of other groups.

258

Females are thus significantly more likely to develop the disease cluster of arthritis, asthma,

259

allergy, depression, and thyroid disease than males and, thus, endure a lower quality-of-life for

260

longer than males. Such gender inequality in healthy life expectancy, caused by multimorbidity,

261

warrants public health interventions targeting the female elderly.

262

Our study had certain limitations. Analysis was based on a limited number of chronic

263

diseases recorded by the KNHANES only from non-institutionalized Koreans who were able to

264

participate in the survey. In addition, we only considered disease occurrence and, thus, not duration

265

or severity. Finally, we cannot discuss causal relationships between diseases because the survey

266

was cross-sectional in nature. However, using a large and nationally representative sample, we

267

identified multimorbidity patterns, and associations between such patterns and both

268

sociodemographic factors and health-related quality-of-life. Our findings deepen our

269

understanding of non-random associations between diseases; this will aid the design of useful,

270

effective, holistic healthcare and preventative strategies addressing the needs of multimorbid

271

individuals and those at high risk of multimorbidity. In addition, given that the multimorbidity

272

patterns are associated with poor quality-of-life and sociodemographic inequalities, targeted

273

multimorbidity management is important to reduce the burden on the vulnerable population and to

274

address the associated social inequalities.
