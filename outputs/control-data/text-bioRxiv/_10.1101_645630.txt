Abstract

9

Background: The keystone zooplankton Daphnia magna has recently been used as a

10

model system for understanding host-microbiota interactions. However, the bacterial

11

species present and functions associated with their genomes are not well understood.

12

In order to understand potential functions of these species, we combined 16S rRNA

13

sequencing and shotgun metagenomics to characterize the whole-organism microbiota

14

of Daphnia magna.

15
16

Results: Five metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were assembled from the

17

Daphnia magna microbiota. Phylogenetic placement of these MAGs indicated that two

18

belong to the Limnohabitans genus, one to Polaromonas, one to Pedobacter, and one

19

unclassifiable below the Burkholderiaceae family. Average nucleotide identity of these

20

MAGs to their closest sequenced relative was <95%, suggesting these may be new

21

species in known genera. 16S rRNA community profiling shows that the Daphnia magna

22

microbiota is distinct from its culture environment. Genes involved in host colonization

23

and immune system evasion were detected across the MAGs. Some metabolic

24

pathways were specific to some MAGs, including sulfur oxidation, nitrate reduction, and

25

flagellar assembly. Threonine and arginine exporters were encoded by the

26

Limnohabitans and Burkholderiaceae MAGs, and pathways for key vitamin biosynthesis

27

and export were identified across MAGs.

28
29

Conclusions: In this study, we characterize five metagenome-assembled bacterial

30

genomes within the Daphnia magna microbiota. Our examination of functions

31

associated with these genomes shows a diversity of nutrient acquisition and metabolism

32

pathways present that may benefit the host, as well as genomic signatures of host

33

association and immune system evasion.

Introduction

38

Organisms are hosts to complex communities of microorganisms that live on any tissue

39

in contact with the environment, collectively known as the microbiota. Species in the

40

microbiota may provide beneficial functions to the host and to other species in the

41

microbiota, including nutrient acquisition and uptake [1], production of host-accessible

42

metabolites [2], host immune system priming [3], and direct pathogen protection [4].

43

However, characterizing these beneficial host-microbe and microbe-microbe

44

interactions in biologically relevant systems can be difficult due to the number of core

3

45

species present in the microbiota and the variation in an individual organism’s

46

microbiota over time from dietary changes or differential environmental exposure [5].

47
48

The zooplankton Daphnia magna provides a useful model for studying functional

49

relationships between microbes and their hosts. Daphnia species are used as a model

50

system in ecology, ecotoxicology, and host-parasite dynamics due to their well-

51

documented life cycle and rapid asexual reproduction [6]. The ability to raise Daphnia

52

magna clonally in the laboratory allows for genetically identical hosts to be used

53

experimentally, reducing the impact of genetic variation on the microbiota.

54

Furthermore, their indiscriminate filter feeding within the water column allows for

55

control over food input. Daphnia are colonized with bacteria throughout their entire

56

body cavity and gut [7,8]. Composition of the Daphnia microbiota appears to be similar

57

in spatially unique populations [8,9], suggesting mechanisms of acquisition and

58

cultivation of these microbes by the host. The Daphnia microbiota is relatively simple at

59

the class level, with b-proteobacteria, g-proteobacteria, and Flavobacteriia consistently

60

identified at high relative abundances [9,10]. While some work on the Daphnia

61

microbiota has used shotgun sequences to examine potential bacterial symbionts [7],

62

the majority of studies have used coarse-level 16S rRNA analyses to profile the taxa

63

present. Species-level identification and subsequent functional profiling of the Daphnia

64

microbiota has not been achieved with these studies, as resolution of the microbiota

65

using 16S rRNA sequencing can only reliably identify bacterial genera. Much of the

66

genomic content of Daphnia-associated bacteria is unknown, and potentially novel taxa

67

may not be identified by standard 16S rRNA techniques.

68
69

Beyond identifying the composition of the microbiota, it is clear that this composition

70

affects host fitness. The microbiota as a whole has been implicated in nutrient

71

acquisition and breakdown of toxic compounds [11], and survival and growth are

72

affected by the presence of, and perturbations to, the microbiota [12-14]. Host

73

fecundity has been specifically tied to the most abundant genus in the Daphnia

74

microbiota, Limnohabitans. Entirely bacteria-free Daphnia experience significant

75

declines in fecundity, but monocolonization of bacteria-free Daphnia with

76

Limnohabitans restores fecundity to that of Daphnia with a complete microbiota [15].

77

However, it is unclear what metabolic functions Limnohabitans provides to achieve

78

these effects. How the other species in the Daphnia microbiota contribute to host life

79

history and what functions these species may be providing is entirely unclear.

80
81

Here, we use shotgun metagenomics to characterize the bacterial species present in

82

the Daphnia magna microbiota. The metagenome-assembled genomes generated from

83

this data were then used to examine potential metabolic functions of the microbiota in

84

total and for each species assembled. This study is the first to report metagenome-

85

assembled genomes of bacteria in the Daphnia magna microbiota and is the first to

86

suggest functions based on gene content of these microbes. This increased resolution

87

allows us to formulate testable hypotheses about the metabolic interactions happening

88

between the host and microbes, and among microbes, that impact host fitness. This

89

functional knowledge will provide a new lens for studying this important ecological

90

model system.

Results

93

Shotgun sequencing, assembly, and binning

94

Shotgun sequencing of the adult and juvenile Daphnia magna microbiota resulted in

95

20.19Mbp of paired-end Illumina read data, which was then reduced to 9.64Mbp after

96

quality trimming and host genome filtering. A co-assembly of all four samples

97

generated 174,991 contigs (N50 of 1,923bp; longest assembled contig 226,522bp).

98

Summaries of assembly statistics for the co-assemblies and the individual sample

99

assemblies can be found in Table 1. Identification of high-quality reads and ≥1000bp

100

assembled contigs using Kraken, Kaiju, and MetaPhlAn2 indicated 18 genera that were

101

present as more than 1% of the sample (Supplementary Figure 1). Of the 18 genera,

102

only Limnohabitans was identified by all three tools in reads and contigs. Other

103

abundant genera included Pedobacter, Flavobacterium, Polaromonas and other

104

unclassified Burkholderiaceae. 16S rRNA sequencing of the library preparation and

105

DNA extraction kits resulted in <50 reads (Figure 1A). 16S rRNA community profiles of

106

the Daphnia magna food source, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the COMBO culture

107

media Daphnia magna are raised in, and samples of 5 healthy adult Daphnia magna

108

were found to have differences in composition (Figure 1A). The Chlamydomonas

109

samples showed reduced relative abundance of Proteobacteria as compared to adult

110

Daphnia and the culture media. The culture media showed higher relative abundance

111

of Actinobacteria, and healthy Daphnia magna primarily were colonized by

112

Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. These same community profiles were analyzed using

113

an unweighted principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) on the unweighted UniFrac

114

distances between samples, which represents the phylogenetic relatedness between

115

samples based on ASV presence and absence (Supplementary Figure 2). The three

116

sample groups were found to cluster separately, with no overlap.

CONCOCT clustering of contigs from the master co-assembly by tetranucleotide

130

composition, GC content, and coverage resulted in 19 bins of draft and incomplete

131

genomes. Manual curation, refinement, and merging using Anvi’o resulted in 15 bins,

132

with 7 meeting the ≥50 quality metric. The adult-only co-assembly generated 12 bins,

133

which further refined to 5 bins, with 4 meeting the ≥50 quality metric (Supplementary

134

Figure 5). Three of the four high-quality bins were also present in the master co-

135

assembly and one unique bin was identified. The juvenile-only co-assembly generated

136

15 bins, which further refined to 7 bins, with 4 meeting the ≥50 quality metric

137

(Supplementary Figure 6). Because the master co-assembly generated bins with higher

138

coverage or higher completeness, we used GTDB-Tk on bins refined in the master co-

139

assembly only. Phylogenetic placement using GTDB-Tk for the seven high- and

140

medium-quality bacterial MAGs identified from the master co-assembly placed two in

141

143

(Burkholderiaceae MAG), one in the Pedobacter genus (Pedobacter MAG), one in the

144

Emticicia genus, and one unable to be placed below the Chitinophagales order

145

(Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Figure 4). None of the MAGs mapped to

146

previously identified species in the GTDB-Tk database. Average nucleotide identity of

147

the two Limnohabitans MAGs was measured at 86.6% similarity. This is less than the

148

95% cutoff generally accepted for strain-levels similarity, suggesting the MAGs are

149

likely separate species [16].

150
151

To examine potential functions of the Daphnia magna microbiota, we focused on the

152

three most complete MAGs: unknown Burkholderiaceae, 99.28% complete, 11.5X

153

mean coverage; Pedobacter sp., 98.56% complete, 14.87X mean coverage; and

154

Polaromonas sp., 82.73% complete, 15.3X mean coverage. We also examined the two

155

Limnohabitans MAGs: sp1, 78.42% complete, 29.99X coverage; sp2, 60.43% complete,

156

14.16X coverage (Figure 2). Though the Limnohabitans MAGs were not over 90%

157

complete, according to read-based and contig-based identification tools they were the

158

most abundant, and coverage of both exceeded 30x in the juvenile D. magna samples.

159

Furthermore, prior work has indicated the presence and importance of this genus in the

160

Daphnia magna microbiota, suggesting unique functions may be present in these

Functional profiling of the five high- and medium-quality bacterial metagenome-

assembled genomes

180

Contigs from the entire metagenome and from the 5 MAGs independently were

181

analyzed for potential coding sequences (CDS) using Prokka. All identified CDS were

182

then queried against the KEGG database using GhostKOALA and identified orthologs

183

of functional genes were grouped and quantified into KEGG functional categories

184

(Figure 3). We focused on pathways associated with respiration, carbohydrate

185

metabolism, amino acid metabolism, other energy metabolism, and transport. These

186

functional categories indicate not only general metabolism for these species, but also

187

could indicate what functions these species are providing to the host. Out of the 7,453

188

CDS from the five high-quality MAGs that mapped to KEGG pathways, 707 (9.48%)

189

were associated with carbohydrate metabolism, 642 (8.71%) were associated with

190

amino acid metabolism, and 358 (4.80%) were associated with other energy

191

metabolism (Figure 3A-B; Supplementary Figure 3). Although C. reinhardtii has a

192

relatively high concentration of lipids [17], only 188 (2.52%) of all CDS were associated

193

with lipid metabolism. To understand how much genetic overlap there was among the

194

five MAGs, we compared predicted genes identified with Prokka and clustered with

195

OrthoVenn. The two Limnohabitans MAGs shared the highest number of genes (641),

196

and across all MAGs 325 genes were shared (Figure 4). The Pedobacter MAG had the

197

most unique genes in its gene set (117), while the Burkholderiaceae had so much

198

overlap with other MAGs that it had relatively few unique genes (21).

230

the described shared and unique functions and some functions specifically associated

231

with host association as genomic signals of host association, providing potential

232

explanations for why these genera are commonly found in the Daphnia magna

233

microbiota.

234
235

Shared functions of the Daphnia magna microbiota

236

Nutrient uptake and major biosynthesis pathways. All five MAGs shared genes involved

237

in some key metabolic pathways (Table 3, ‘All’ MAGs, Supplementary Tables 2 & 3). In

238

all MAGs, a complete TCA cycle was encoded. Genes encoding a cytochrome c

239

oxidase were identified in all MAGs, suggesting all have the capacity for aerobic

240

respiration. All encoded for lipopolysaccharide transport and lipoprotein release. All

241

MAGs except the Pedobacter encoded for a complete glyoxylate cycle, and the non-

242

oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway was present in all MAGs except the

243

Limnohabitans species. Transporters for multiple TCA cycle intermediates are present

244

across the MAGs, including a C4-dicarboxylate transport system in all MAGs that allows

245

for transport of multiple different molecules into bacterial cells. Other transporters for

246

TCA cycle intermediates encoded included those for alpha-glucosides, malate,

247

fumarate, 2-oxogultarate, succinate, and aspartate.

248
249

Transport and biosynthesis of other essential molecules were shared across MAGs as

250

well. All MAGs except Pedobacter shared transport systems for phospholipids,

251

phosphate, and branched-chain amino acids. All species except for Limnohabitans

252

MAG 2 encoded for the elongation step of fatty acid biosynthesis, but only the

253

Burkholderiaceae, Polaromonas, and Pedobacter MAGs encoded for fatty acid

254

biosynthesis initiation. The Limnohabitans MAGs shared multiple copies of sialic acid

255

TRAP transporter genes (siaM, siaT, siaQ).

256
257

All genomes encoded for the transport of multiple necessary vitamins, including

258

riboflavin (B2, ribX, ribY, ribZ), pantothenate precursors (B5, panS), and cobalamin (B12,

259

btuB). Genes involved in the salvage pathway for cobalamin were also present in both

260

Limnohabitans MAGs and in the Polaromonas MAGs (cobO, cobP). Some species were

261

also able to biosynthesize vitamins: the Pedobacter and Polaromonas MAGs encoded

262

for biotin biosynthesis, and all MAGs except Pedobacter encoded for tetrahydrofolate

263

biosynthesis. All MAGs encoded for a pyridoxine 5-phosphate synthase (PdxJ),

264

indicating likely biosynthesis of pyridoxine (B6).

266

Biosynthesis and transport of amino acids varied across MAGs, with no shared amino

267

acid transport systems present across all species. All MAGs except Pedobacter were

268

able to biosynthesize arginine and ornithine. The Burkholderiacae, Limnohabitans 1,

269

and Polaromonas MAGs encoded for threonine, cysteine, lysine, proline, phenylalanine,

270

tyrosine, and glutathione biosynthesis. Valine, leucine, and tryptophan were also able

271

to be biosynthesized by some of the MAGs.

272
273

Host and environment interaction. Superoxide dismutase (sodA, sodB) and catalase-

274

peroxidase (katG) were found in all MAGs. These act as reactive oxygen species

275

detoxifiers and scavengers. The universal minimal Tat system was encoded by all MAGs

276

(tatA, tatC), and both Limnohabitans MAGs also encoded tatB, allowing all of these

277

species to transport folded proteins across their cell membranes. Complete adhesin

278

transport systems and a gene associated with type IV pilus biosynthesis were present in

279

both Limnohabitans MAGs and the Polaromonas MAG (pilQ). These MAGs also

280

encoded two membrane proteases related to aminoglycoside resistance (HtpX, FtsH)

281

[19]. All MAGs except the Pedobacter encoded for the QseC-QseB quorum sensing

282

regulatory system. Though the Polaromonas MAG was the only one to encode for

283

complete flagellar assembly, the Limnohabitans MAGs encoded for multiple genes

19

284

involved in flagellar assembly (flhA, flhB, flgB – L). A gene for chemotaxis protein CheA

285

was present in these three MAGs as well.

286
287

As none of the MAGs encoded for all necessary amino acid biosynthesis pathways,

288

some amino acid importers were present across the MAGs. These include arginine

289

(artM), proline (proP), cystine (yecS) in Limnohabitans MAGs, glutamine (glnQ, glnM)

290

and glutathione (gsiC) in Limnohabitans MAGs and in the Polaromonas MAG, and

291

histidine (hisP, hisM, hisQ) in the Burkholderiaceae MAG and Limnohabitans MAG 1. It

292

is unclear whether food (e.g., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) or export from other bacteria

293

is the source of these amino acids for these MAGs. As some MAGs are able to

294

biosynthesize amino acids that others must import, there may be cross-feeding among

295

species in the microbiota occurring.

296
297

Environmental stress tolerance mechanisms were shared among genomes as well. All

298

encoded for the phosphate starvation response regulatory system PhoR-PhoB. The

299

Limnohabitans MAGs and the Polaromonas MAG shared the EnvZ-OmpR osmotic

300

stress response system, allowing the bacterial cells to respond to changes in osmolality.

301

Limnohabitans MAG 2 and the Polaromonas MAG shared CusS-CusR, a copper

302

tolerance regulatory system.

303
304

MAG-specific functions of the Daphnia magna microbiota

305

Nutrient uptake and major energy pathways. There were potential differences in

306

respiration for some of the MAGs. The Burkholderiaceae encoded a nitrate/nitrite

307

transporter (narK) and a respiratory nitrate reductase (narGHI). Use of this system for

308

respiration was supported by the presence of genes encoding the nitrate respiration

309

two-component regulatory system NarX-NarL. The Polaromonas encoded for

310

thiosulfate transport (cysT, cysW, cysP) and potential use via a subunit of the Sox

311

complex (soxA). We found a supplementary energy pathway in the Limnohabitans

312

MAGs, which share a pathway for the biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll (pufLM, bchY).

313

This pathway has been documented in other Limnohabitans species [20].

314
315

Differences in carbohydrate metabolism among MAGs was apparent. The Pedobacter

316

MAG was the only high-quality genome to encode for glycolysis and glycogen

317

biosynthesis; the Burkholderiaceae MAG for the Leloir pathway; and Limnohabitans

318

MAG 2 for the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The Polaromonas MAG encoded for a

319

complete beta-oxidation system, enabling fatty acid metabolism. Different

320

carbohydrate transporters were found in the MAGs as well. Limnohabitans MAG 1

321

uniquely encoded for the transport of glucose, mannose, and glycerol (gtsABC, malK).

21

322

It also encoded for transport of L-arabinose (araPQ) and for a semiSWEET general sugar

323

transporter. The Burkholderiaceae MAG encoded for methyl-galactoside transport

324

(mglABC) and a galactose processing pathway. The Pedobacter MAG can potentially

325

utilize chitin, as the MAG uniquely encoded for chitin degradation to fructose-6-

326

phosphate (chiA, chb, nagB).

327
328

Other pathways for vitamin and amino acid import, biosynthesis, and degradation were

329

uniquely present in some genomes. Limnohabitans MAG 1 was the only MAG to

330

encode taurine import (tauA, tauB). This MAG also uniquely encoded a pathway for the

331

degradation of histidine to glutamate. Limnohabitans MAG 2 could transport thiamine

332

into the cell via a putative thiamine transport system (KEGG Module M00192).

333

Uniquely, Polaromonas could synthesize cobalamin (cobA, cobQ, cbiB, cobP, cobC). It

334

may also synthesize riboflavin via the purine biosynthesis pathway.

335
336

Host and environment interaction. Multiple genes and pathways involved in antibiotic

337

resistance and detoxification were found in the bacterial MAGs. Pedobacter encoded

338

an MdlAB/SmdAB transporter as well as two genes involved in macrolide (macA, macB).

339

The Polaromonas MAG encoded an AcrAB-TolC/SmeDEF efflux pump, and the

22

340

Burkholderiaceae MAG encoded the BaeS-BaeR envelope stress response two-

341

component regulatory system.

342
343

The MAGs encoded for different secretion systems and regulatory systems. The

344

Polaromonas MAG was the only one to encode for a type I secretion system (RaxAB-

345

RaxC). The Burkholderiaceae MAG encoded for an alpha-hemolysin and cyclolysin

346

secretion system and a type IV secretion system (virB1 – 5, 10, 11). The

347

Burkholderiaceae MAG encoded for an osmotically-inducible protein, OsmY, part of an

348

osmoprotectant ABC transporter complex, and a putrescine transporter (potFGHI).

349
350

Genomic signs of host association in the Daphnia magna microbiota

351

Because the Daphnia magna microbiota has been shown to differ significantly from the

352

surrounding aquatic environment at the genus level [9,21], we examined the MAGs for

353

any potential indicators of host association. Multiple instances of host immune system

354

evasion or tolerance were noted in the MAGs. Both Limnohabitans MAGs encoded for

355

the microbial stealth protein CpsY, implicated in host immune system evasion [22].

356

Genes involved in dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis were present in all MAGs, indicating

357

these species are able to use rhamnose as an alternative cell wall polysaccharide. L-

358

rhamnose has been linked to bacterial viability and virulence [23], and similarly

23

359

structured polysaccharides have been shown to modulate host immune systems [24]. A

360

gene involved in quorum quenching (signaling between other microbial species or

361

between microbes and the host) was identified in Limnohabitans MAG 1 and the

362

Pedobacter MAG (ytnP). Other virulence factors and regulators were identified in both

363

Limnohabitans and the Pedobacter MAG (cvfB, bvgS/bvgA).

364
365

These bacterial species may benefit the host via amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis

366

and export. Complex eukaryotes must acquire some essential vitamins and amino acids

367

from their diet or from heterotrophic microorganisms. Six amino acids have been

368

demonstrated as essential for Daphnia magna’s close relative, Daphnia pulex: arginine,

369

histidine, leucine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, and tryptophan [25]. All of the dietary

370

essential amino acids are biosynthesized by at least one of the MAGs, and some may

371

be able to export these as well. The Limnohabitans MAGs and the Burkholderiaceae

372

MAG encode for an arginine exporter (argO), Limnohabitans sp. 1 encodes for a

373

threonine exporter (rhtA), and the Burkholderiaceae MAG a threonine-serine exchanger

374

(steT). The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii food source used here does not contain

375

cobalamin [26], a beneficial vitamin for Daphnia magna, suggesting that Daphnia

376

magna raised in culture must acquire cobalamin from the culture media and from

377

microorganisms. In the Daphnia metagenome, the Polaromonas MAG encodes for

24

378

cobalamin biosynthesis. Other vitamins are biosynthesized by at least one of the MAGs,

379

including tetrahydrofolate, biotin, and pyridoxine. Supplementation of Daphnia magna

380

growth media with biotin and cobalamin has been shown to increase host fitness [27],

381

though it is unclear if these vitamins are essential for Daphnia survival.

382
383

Other host-microbe interactions were also present in the MAGs. An essential nutrient

384

for bacteria is iron, and catalase genes were found in all MAGs along with other ABC

385

transporters for iron. The Limnohabitans MAG 2 encoded for heme binding proteins

386

and a heme export system (ccmB, ccmC), systems implicated in bacterial use of host-

387

synthesized heme [28]. The Pedobacter MAG encoded for an N-acetylneuraminate

388

lyase (nanA) and all five MAGs contain genes involved in transport of sialic acids. As

389

sialic acids are found in complex host tissue [29], this may indicate cleavage of sialic

390

acids from host cells for import and use by the bacteria. Pathways involved in host

391

invasion and colonization were also present in the MAGs. The Polaromonas MAG

392

encoded a suite of type IV pilus and fimbriae associated genes, including type IV pilus

393

biogenesis factors (pilY1, pilQ), fimbrial proteins (pilE), the type IV fimbriae synthesis

394

two-component regulatory system PilS-PilR, and a complete set of flagellar assembly

395

genes. This MAG, along with the two Limnohabitans Mags, also encoded for twitching

396

motility (pilT). Both Limnohabitans MAGs encoded for swarming motility (swrC, rssA),

25

397

and all three for other genes involved in chemotaxis (pctA, cheA, cheY, tar, cheB,

398

mcp4, tsr, cheW). Though genes for adhesin production were not identified, genes

399

involved in adhesin transport were identified in both Limnohabitans MAGs and in the

400

Burkholderiaceae MAG (bmaC, ehaG, ata).

402

Discussion

403

To date, studies examining the Daphnia magna microbiota have only sequenced the

404

16S rRNA marker gene to understand broad-level interactions and functions of the

405

microbiota. Here, we were able to assemble the first metagenome-assembled genomes

406

from the Daphnia magna microbiota to elucidate genome-specific functions associated

407

with highly abundant members of the bacterial community. Our 16S rRNA gene level

408

data shows that the Daphnia magna bacterial community is structured differently than

409

the surrounding environment and from the microbiome of their food, which has been

410

also been corroborated by earlier studies [9,30]. We identified five MAGs that were

411

distinct from each other and distinct from their closest sequenced relatives based on

412

average nucleotide identity. We found that these MAGs were high- or medium-quality,

413

meaning they contained some or most of the single-copy genes found in all bacteria.

414

With metagenomic short-read shotgun sequencing it is unlikely that the MAGs

415

assembled here contained the full gene sets associated with these species; however,

26

416

bins of relatively high-quality suggest that we found many important genes within each

417

assembled genome. Most studies of the Daphnia magna microbiota using marker-

418

based sequencing have identified more OTUs or ASVs and higher diversity than the 12

419

bins we identified, likely due to the higher sequencing depth necessary for shotgun

420

sequencing to identify rare taxa [31]. However, the five MAGs assembled from our

421

shotgun sequencing are mostly consistent with genera found in 16S rRNA sequencing

422

from other studies and from our own sequencing.

423
424

The Burkholderiales order has been demonstrated as the most abundant in the

425

Daphnia gut and whole organism microbiota [9,13], and four of the five MAGs

426

assembled here were identified to families or genera within this order. Two

427

Limnohabitans MAGs were assembled and found at high abundances in adults and

428

juveniles. Within the Burkholderiales, the genus Limnohabitans has been reported to be

429

highly abundant in the Daphnia microbiota, and has been implicated in increasing host

430

fecundity [12,15]. Here, we show that there are two distinct Limnohabitans MAGs that

431

encode for different metabolic potential. Only one other study has definitively

432

identified more than one OTU in this genus [13]. We also identify two other MAGs in

433

the Burkholderiales order, including a Polaromonas species and one unclassified

27

434

Burkholderiaceae. Surprisingly, we also identify a Pedobacter MAG, which has

435

previously only been reported as a rare taxon in the Daphnia microbiota [32].

436
437

Analysis of annotated genes and pathways across the five MAGs showed overlap and

438

differences in metabolism. Key pathways such as the TCA cycle were shared across all

439

MAGs, and multiple ABC transporters of key vitamins and amino acids were identified.

440

Many genes encoding for the use of different carbohydrates were encoded across the

441

MAGs. Microalgae are generally rich in carbohydrates [33] and serve as a major food

442

source for Daphnia magna [34], potentially allowing these microbes easy access to

443

myriad nutrient sources. The two Limnohabitans MAGs shared a high proportion of

444

annotated genes, suggesting some functional similarity between them. Indeed,

445

multiple metabolic pathways were shared between these two MAGs, including the

446

glyoxylate cycle, bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of some vitamins

447

and amino acids. The Limnohabitans MAGs also shared many genomic features with

448

the Polaromonas MAG and the Burkholderiaceae MAG, including multiple TCA cycle

449

intermediate importers and several transport systems. There is also potential flexibility

450

among the taxa in encoded respiration, notably in the Polaromonas MAG’s ability to

451

use thiosulfate and the Burkholderiaceae’s ability to utilize nitrate under hypoxic

452

conditions. Along with the variety of two-component regulatory systems found within

28

453

each MAG, the wide range of potential respiratory pathways may allow functions to

454

sustain through different bacterial species even when stressful environments cause

455

fluctuations in the abundance of species within the microbiota.

456
457

The difference between taxa identified in the Daphnia magna microbiota and its

458

environment suggest that there are some key interactions between the host and its

459

associated microbes in order to establish and maintain these microbial populations.

460

Furthermore, there may be some interactions between bacterial species in the

461

microbiota that could impact the host. We found many genes in the Limnohabitans

462

MAGs and the Polaromonas MAG involved in flagellar assembly, type IV pilus

463

biogenesis and production, and biofilm formation, all of which have been implicated in

464

host colonization and successful adhesion to host-associated surfaces [35,36,37]. All

465

MAGs encode for l-rhamnose production, which has been implicated in adhesion to

466

other cells [23]. Genes in secretion systems implicated in host cell adhesion, particularly

467

Type I, II, and IV were also encoded [38]. We found many genes involved in host

468

immune system evasion or modification, which may allow these bacteria to persist

469

within the host species [39]. Notably, superoxide dismutase and catalase were encoded

470

by multiple MAGs, suggesting the bacteria could defend against radical oxygen species

471

produced by the host as a defense mechanism [40]. Also present across MAGs are

29

472

genes involved in the detoxification of antibiotics and toxins, including multidrug efflux

473

transporters and pumps (MdlAB/SmdAB, AcrAB-TolC/SmeDEF), macrolide export

474

(macA, macB), and stress tolerance to antibiotics (BaeS-BaeR).

475
476

Biosynthesis and provision of amino acids by bacteria to their host is a well-

477

documented set of interactions that is known to confer fitness benefits to the host [41-

478

43]. Here, we find that the Limnohabitans MAGs and the Burkholderiaceae MAG

479

encode for the export of arginine and threonine, essential amino acids for the host

480

Daphnia [25]. Similarly, biosynthesis or metabolism of vitamins and minerals by bacteria

481

and provisioning to the host has been well-documented in the microbiota of other

482

organisms [44-46]. Many genes involved in vitamin B biosynthesis were found across all

483

MAGs. Media supplemented with cobalamin (B12) is used to successfully culture

484

Daphnia magna [47], and we find the Polaromonas MAG encoded for a complete

485

cobalamin biosynthesis pathway, suggesting potential vitamin provisioning to the host

486

from this species. We also find a potential microbe-microbe interaction, where the

487

Pedobacter MAG encodes for cleavage of sialic acids from host tissue, where it can

488

then be transported and utilized by other species as a carbohydrate source via a sialic

489

acid TRAP transporter. The breakdown of sialic acid to metabolites that are accessible

490

to the host by microbiome-associated species has been shown to increase host fitness

491

[48]. If Limnohabitans are able to use sialic acid as a nutrient source, this may be the

492

basis for a microbe-host-microbe interaction, where Limnohabitans provides essential

493

amino acids to the host using energy generated from metabolism of molecules

494

provisioned from the host.

495
496

In total, our data shows that there is much versatility in metabolism among the MAGs,

497

but some overlap in function. As Daphnia magna are indiscriminate filter feeders, they

498

may feed on a wide variety of particulate matter with variable nutrient profiles. The

499

versatility in metabolism encoded by these MAGs indicates that they are able to utilize

500

this unpredictable range of nutrients both in the digestive tract and on the carapace.

501

The specific functions of certain MAGs, particularly in amino acid and vitamin

502

biosynthesis and export, seem critical in providing nutritional benefits to the host

503

zooplankton.

504
505

Conclusions

506

Daphnia magna is an important model system for multiple facets of ecology, and has

507

recently become an organism of interest for understanding fundamental questions

508

about the microbiota. Our metagenomic sequencing and subsequent analysis

509

characterizes the Daphnia magna microbiota to the species level and finds some

genomic features that allow core bacterial species to acquire and biosynthesize

511

nutrients, and to potentially interact with their host via amino acid and vitamin export.

512

By examining this relatively simple microbiota via metagenome-assembled genomes,

513

we can begin to investigate metabolic interactions between the host and its associated

514

microbes. Future work to further elucidate functions of these MAGs will involve long-

515

read metagenome sequencing to complete genome assemblies and pure, single-

516

isolate sequencing to understand strain variation within the microbiota. Furthermore,

517

transcriptomics and metabolomics could be used to understand which of these

518

encoded genes are functioning under different environmental and host conditions, and

519

will direct future hypotheses on host-microbiota interactions. For example, how much of

520

the differences in Daphnia life history and population dynamics across food

521

environments [49] can be attributed to differences in microbiota composition? These

522

results will help to inform future work studying the effects of the microbiota on host

523

health and population dynamics across ecological contexts. Moreover, as more

524

populations of Daphnia and their microbiota are sequenced, it will become possible to

525

examine the coevolutionary relationships between hosts and microbiota, and this

526

functional information will be essential for making sense of those relationships.

529

Sample collection and extraction. Two samples of 100 21-day-old adult Daphnia magna

530

and two samples of 6-day-old juvenile Daphnia were collected from laboratory cultures

531

maintained in defined COMBO medium [47]. Laboratory cultures were fed a

532

standardized volume of green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CPCC 243) to provide

533

0.25 mg C/ml/day. Samples were immediately ground after collection using in sterile

534

1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes. To separate bacterial cells from host cells, a modified

535

protocol from Benson et al. 2014 was used [50]. Samples were suspended in 2mL PBE

536

buffer and layered on a cushion of 50% sucrose, then centrifuged at 4,000g for 10

537

minutes. DNA was extracted from the pellets at the base of the sucrose fractions

538

following the Qiagen DNEasy Blood & Tissue Kit spin-column protocol of total DNA

539

from animal tissues (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

540
541

Library preparation and sequencing. Shotgun sequencing libraries from the two adult

542

samples and two technical replicates of one juvenile sample were prepared and

543

multiplexed using the Illumina Nextera XT kit and protocol. Input DNA was quantified

544

using the Qubit dsDNA system. Libraries were checked using the Agilent Technology

545

2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were manually normalized due to a final library yield under

546

10nM. Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq using a MiSeq

547

Reagent Kit V2.

548
549

Quality filtering and metagenome assembly. Reads were demultiplexed using the built-

550

in Illumina MiSeq Reporter. Quality of demultiplexed reads was checked using FastQC

551

v0.11.5. Reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.36 [51] with the commands:

552

ILLUMINACLIP:NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3

553

SLIDINGWINDOW:4:25 MINLEN:36 to remove adapter sequences and to remove

554

segments of reads where quality fell below 25. Trimmed reads were mapped to the

555

Daphnia magna draft genome [52] using BWA [53], Samtools [54], and BEDtools [55],

556

and reads with greater than 80% identity over 50% of the read were filtered. Remaining

557

paired unmapped reads were assembled de novo using metaSPAdes in SPAdes v3.11

558

[56]. A co-assembly of all four samples, a co-assembly of the adult samples, a co-

559

assembly of the juvenile samples, and individual assemblies for each sample were

560

created.

561
562

Taxonomy-independent sequence binning and identification of individual

563

metagenome-assembled genomes. To resolve genomes of identified organisms and to

564

discover genomes of organisms not present in read-based taxonomy identification

565

programs or entirely new organisms, contigs from the master co-assembly with reads

566

mapped from each sample were binned using CONCOCT within Anvi’o [57], accepting

567

contigs over 2500 bp in length. Contigs greater than 20kb in length were split into

568

20kb fragments prior to running CONCOCT. Bins from the master co-assembly were

569

assessed using Anvi’o, using Parks et al.’s quality score (genome completeness - 5x

570

estimated redundancy or contamination) of ≥50 as a cutoff for further refinement [58].

571

Bins meeting this quality cutoff were manually curated within Anvi’o, where contigs

572

within a bin that deviated dramatically from the mean GC content or mean coverage of

573

the bin were removed from the bin. Bins that increased completeness when merged,

574

did not increase redundancy above 10%, and were similar in GC content were merged.

575

Bins that did not have high (>90% completion) or medium quality (>50% completion)

576

after merging and refining were not analyzed further. After merging and refining, bins

577

that still met the quality score cutoff were assigned taxonomy using GTDB-Tk [59,60].

578

GTDB-Tk uses average nucleotide identity and genome topology to find the closest

579

genomic relative in its database. The same process was repeated for the juvenile co-

580

assembly and the adult co-assembly to confirm species presence and attempt to

581

resolve species identity at different host life stages. Similarity between MAGs was

582

calculated using the average nucleotide identity tool in Pyani [61].

583
584

Read-based taxonomic classification. Kaiju v1.5 [62], Kraken v1.0 [63], and MetaPhlAn2

585

v2.6 [64] were used to assign taxonomy to reads. We used all three identifiers due to

35

586

due to Kaiju’s high rate of false identification [65] and MetaPhlAn2’s use of specific

587

marker genes from reference organisms rather than entire genomes. All programs were

588

used with their built-in databases. Kraken results were confirmed via cross-comparison

589

of abundant species with both Kaiju and MetaPhlAn2. All three taxonomy profilers were

590

also used to assign taxonomy to contigs assembled from each sample. Visualization of

591

each sample’s community composition was performed in R.

592
593

Functional profiling. Contigs from each metagenome-assembled genome and from the

594

adult, juvenile, and master co-assemblies were annotated using Prokka v1.12 [66].

595

Genes annotated in Prokka were assigned KOs (KEGG Orthologs) using the

596

GhostKOALA tool on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [67]. KOs

597

identified from GhostKOALA were mapped to standard KEGG categories and

598

metabolic pathways using the KEGG Pathway Mapper & KEGG Module tools to

599

examine pathway completeness and identify pathways of interest [68]. Genes identified

600

using KEGG and GhostKOALA in each MAG were compared using OrthoVenn [69].

601

Overlapping and unique orthologs were compared using custom R scripts and with the

602

‘UpSetR’ package [70].

16S rRNA gene sequencing and identification of contaminant taxa. The V4

605

hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using

606

a MiSeq Reagent Kit V2 and the same Qiagen DNEasy Blood & Tissue Kit and reagents

607

as in the shotgun sequencing sample processing. Four samples of five adult Daphnia

608

magna were sequenced to compare community composition found in 16S sequencing

609

to that found in shotgun sequencing, along with four samples of the COMBO media

610

Daphnia magna cultures are raised in, four samples of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and

611

two samples of the DNA sequencing kit and library preparation kit as negative controls.

612

Paired-end reads were analyzed in R using the ‘dada2’ package to trim primer

613

sequences, identify amplicon sequence variants, and assign taxonomy [71]. Taxonomy

614

was assigned using the RefSeq+RDP taxonomic training data set formatted for dada2

615

[72]. Further analysis of community composition and visualization were carried out using

616

the ‘phyloseq’ package in R [73].
