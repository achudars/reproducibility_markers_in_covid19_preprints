ABSTRACT (139 words)

2

Cullin RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases SCFTIR1/AFB1-5 and their ubiquitylation targets,

3

AUX/IAAs, sense auxin concentrations in the nucleus. TIR1 binds a surface-

4

exposed degron in AUX/IAAs promoting their ubiquitylation and rapid auxin-

5

regulated proteasomal degradation. Here, we resolved TIR1·auxin·IAA7 and

6

TIR1·auxin·IAA12 complex topology, and show that flexible intrinsically disordered

7

regions (IDRs) in the degron’s vicinity, cooperatively position AUX/IAAs on TIR1. The

8

AUX/IAA PB1 interaction domain also assists in non-native contacts, affecting

9

AUX/IAA dynamic interaction states. Our results establish a role for IDRs in

10

modulating auxin receptor assemblies. By securing AUX/IAAs on two opposite

11

surfaces of TIR1, IDR diversity supports locally tailored positioning for targeted

12

ubiquitylation, and might provide conformational flexibility for adopting a multiplicity

13

of functional states. We postulate IDRs in distinct members of the AUX/IAA family to

14

be an adaptive signature for protein interaction and initiation region for proteasome

15

recruitment.

Main text

17

Proteolysis entails tight spatiotemporal regulation of cellular protein pools

18

ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) rules over protein turnover, and controls

19

stimulation or attenuation of gene regulatory networks, depending on whether a

20

degradation target is a transcriptional repressor or activator 2. A typical E1-E2-E3

21

enzymatic cascade warrants specific target ubiquitylation by catalyzing the ATP-

22

dependent attachment of ubiquitin moieties to the target 3. Directly and indirectly, every

23

single aspect of cellular integrity and adaptation is impacted by target ubiquitylation,

24

e.g. cell cycle progression, apoptosis/survival, oxidative stress, differentiation and

25

senescence 4. In SKP1/CULLIN1/F-BOX PROTEIN (SCF)-type E3 ubiquitin ligases,

26

the interchangeable F-BOX PROTEIN (FBP) determines specificity to the E3 through

27

direct physical interactions with the degradation target

28

degradation signal or degron, located mostly within structurally disordered regions,

29

which is precisely recognized by cognate E3 ligases 7. Structural disorder and

30

conformational flexibility within UPS targets confer diversity and specificity on

31

regulated protein ubiquitylation and degradation 7. Primary degrons within a protein

32

family, whose members share the same fate, behave as islands of sequence

33

conservation surrounded by fast divergent intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) 7.

34

Once a favorable E3-target association stage has been accomplished, one or multiple

35

lysines residues neighboring IDRs of the target, often form a ubiquitylation zone of

36

functional exposed ubiquitylation sites 8-10. Local disorder and conformational flexibility

37

brings next an E2-loaded with Ub (E2~Ub) into close proximity to the bound target,

38

such that a suitable microenvironment for catalytic Ub transfer is created 7. Efficient

39

degradation of UPS targets requires the 26S proteasome to bind its protein target

40

through a polyubiquitin chain with a specific topology, and subsequently engages the

51

a mostly conserved VGWPP-[VI]-[RG]-x(2)-R degron as recognition signal for an

AUX/IAAs are themselves auxin regulated, once the intracellular AUX/IAA pool is

replenished, they act again in a negative feedback loop repressing ARF activity 23,24.

TIR1/AFBs and AUX/IAAs assemble at different auxin concentrations, allowing the

Although we currently lack structural information on AUX/IAAs, they are postulated to

80

The dynamic range of auxin sensitivity in plant cells, and by default growth and

developmental responses, relies on efficient AUX/IAA processing by the UPS that we

82

still need to mechanistically understand. The complexity of auxin signaling also

83

underscores the importance of unveiling precisely how different AUX/IAAs can

84

contribute to auxin sensing, engage in multifarious interactions, e.g. TIR1·AUX/IAA,

85

AUX/IAA·AUX/IAA and AUX/IAA·ARF, and undergo ubiquitylation and degradation.

86

While we recognize the degron as TIR1·AUX/IAA interaction motif, we lack information

on how AUX/IAAs are positioned on TIR1, or whether additional structural AUX/IAA

features might impact recruitment and auxin binding. Furthermore, full structure of

AUX/IAA proteins has remained elusive so far, as they appear to adopt a highly flexible

90

fold and/or form high order oligomers due to their PB1 domain.

91

Here, we studied the structural properties of AUX/IAAs and report on intrinsically

92

disordered regions (IDRs) in IAA7 and IAA12 that influence TIR1·AUX/IAA

93

interactions. We pursued a biochemical and structural proteomics approach and

94

unveiled how flexibility in AUX/IAAs affect their conformational ensemble allowing

95

surface accessibility of degrons. Our data demonstrate how an extended fold in

96

AUX/IAAs is favorable for recruitment by the SCFTIR1, and offers a structural constraint

97

for correct positioning on TIR1. Our data lays evidence of how AUXIAAs are fully

98

recognized by the ubiquitylation machinery. We also offer a model of how a potential

99

allosteric effect that fine-tunes TIR1·AUX/IAA interactions echoes into AUX/IAA-

Results

104

AUX/IAAs exhibit intrinsic structural disorder

105

Regions flanking the core GWPPVR degron motif influence AUX/IAA protein

106

recruitment by SCFTIR1, impact auxin binding, and AUX/IAA degradation. A broader

107

sequence context of the AUX/IAA degron might be therefore crucial for the adequate

108

regulation of AUX/IAA processing and turnover, including post-translational

109

modifications (e.g. ubiquitylation), protein-protein interactions and ligand-protein

110

interactions

111

common features of AUX/IAAs in general, we carried out an in silico analysis

112

(IUPred2A) of the 29 members of the Arabidopsis thaliana AUX/IAA family (Fig. 1a,

113

Supplementary Figs. 1). This allows to predict global structural disorder along

114

AUX/IAA protein sequences, and to score the probability of disorder for every amino

115

acid residue in a context-dependent manner

116

IDRs in AUX/IAAs outside the well-structured PB1 domain (Fig. 1a, Supplementary

117

Fig. 1). We defined scores for disorder probability as high (= disordered, >0.6),

118

intermediate (0.4-0.6), or low (= ordered, <0.4). First, IDRs occur in most AUX/IAAs

119

and in almost all AUX/IAA subclades (Fig. 1a). IDR-located residues are enriched in

120

the N-terminal halves of AUX/IAAs and much less so in the C-terminal PB1-domains

121

(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1). The length of the AUX/IAAs does not correlate with

122

an enrichment of disorder segments because IAA1-4 or IAA28 (average length below

123

200 aa) exhibit features of disorder, while similarly small AUX/IAAs (e.g. IAA6, IAA15,

124

IAA19, IAA32, or IAA34) are predicted to be well-structured. Interestingly, all non-

125

canonical AUX/IAAs but IAA33, which lacks the core degron motif for interaction with

126

TIR1 and auxin binding, are rather ordered. IAA33 diverged early during the evolution

127

from the rest of the AUX/IAAs

IAA13, to the most disordered family members. Intriguingly, AUX/IAAs such as IAA7

129

and IAA12, which are members of a different subclade 19, appear to have similar bias

130

for IDRs (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1).

131

IAA7 and IAA12 equip TIR1·AUX/IAA receptor complexes with distinct auxin binding

132

affinities, i.e. Kd TIR1·IAA7 ~10 nM and TIR1·IAA12 ~ 300 nM, respectively 21. These

133

differences are not exclusive to a divergent primary degron, since a TIR1-IAA12GWPPVR

134

co-receptor could not account for high auxin binding affinity 21. This data substantiated

135

the hypothesis that distinct features outside the core degron, such as IDRs, might

136

bestow AUX/IAAs, explicitly IAA7 and IAA12, with unique properties for interaction

137

with TIR1, and therefore auxin sensitivities. In order to investigate the distribution of

138

disorder in IAA7 and IAA12 proteins, we performed in silico analyses using multiple

139

disorder prediction algorithms (Fig. 1b). Consistently, all tested algorithms showed

140

that most of the disorder segments in IAA7 and IAA12 are located on their N-terminal

141

half (upstream of the PB1), and near their C-terminus resembling probably a

142

disordered “piggy tail”. We also observed an enrichment of hydrophilic residues in

143

these IDRs (hydropathy index), which may therefore be solvent exposed (Fig. 1b).

144

Disorder in IAA7 and IAA12 represents almost 50% of their amino acid content. In

145

IAA7 but most notably in IAA12, we observed a predominant “order-dip” corresponding

146

to the core degron (Fig. 1b).

147

Using recombinantly expressed proteins, we further analyzed IAA7 and IAA12

148

secondary structure and overall shape via CD spectroscopy and size exclusion

149

chromatography, respectively (Fig. 1c-d, Supplementary Figs. 2-3). Hereby, we

150

addressed a function-related transient AUX/IAA fold while considering different protein

151

conformational classes. In addition to wild-type and oligomerization-deficient IAA7 and

152

IAA12 full-length proteins (iaa7bm3, iaa12bm3), we incorporated truncated variants of

153

IAA7 and IAA12 lacking the compact PB1 domain. Both iaa7bm3 and iaa12bm3

154

exhibit a rather complex mix of secondary structure elements characteristic of molten

155

globule–like proteins, displaying a minimum at ~205 nm, and a shoulder near 220 nm

156

in CD spectra

157

toward a shorter wavelength with a minimum at just below 200 nm, which is

158

characteristic for random-coil proteins (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2). Figure 1d

159

shows the measured Stokes radii (RS) for iaa7bm3, iaa12bm3 together with the

160

theoretical values of IAA7 and IAA12 displaying specific folds, v.z. native fold (NF),

161

molten globular (MG), premolten globule (PMG), and unfolded (IDP). Since, all

162

measured Stokes radii are larger than the ones expected for their respective natively

163

folded proteins, we concluded that iaa7bm3 and iaa12bm3 adapt extended structures

164

mainly due to large proportions of intrinsically disordered segments outside of the

165

compactly-folded PB1 domain.

CD spectra of PB1-lacking IAA7 and IAA12 appear to be shifted

166
167

What is the impact of intrinsic disordered segments on auxin-dependent

168

SCFTIR1·AUX/IAA associations?

169

IAA7 and IAA12 as well as their sister proteins IAA14 and IAA13, respectively, exhibit

170

striking differences in their degron tail (Supplementary Fig. 4). While IAA7 and IAA14

171

have a short basic degron tail (<30 aa) linking the degron to the PB1 oligomerization

172

domain, IAA12 and IAA13 have a longer (44 aa), highly charged (Lys, Glu, Asp) and

173

unstructured degron tail (Supplementary Fig. 4). Because IAA7 and IAA12 have

174

distinct and contrasting TIR1-interaction properties, we reasoned to pinpoint the

175

determinants of these differences and the impact of IDRs on auxin-dependent

176

TIR1·AUX/IAA associations by creating 16 seamless IAA7 and IAA12 chimeric

177

proteins. We defined five different segments flanked by motifs conserved throughout

the AUX/IAA family: DI (N-terminus including KR motif), core degron (VGWPP-[VI]-

179

[RG]-x(2)-R), the PB1 domain (formerly known as DIII-DIV) and two variable IDRs

180

connecting either the DI and degron (linker), or the degron and PB1 domain (degron

181

tail) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4). We exchanged the modules between IAA7 and

182

IAA12 and used the resulting chimeras for interaction assays with TIR1 in the yeast-

183

two hybrid system (Y2H) for qualitative assessment of auxin co-receptor assembly

184

(Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4). TIR1 interacts in an auxin-dependent manner with

185

IAA7 containing all its native segments, denoted IAA(7-7-7-7-7). Expression of the ß-

186

galactosidase reporter indicates stronger interaction of TIR1·IAA7 than TIR1·IAA12.

187

As expected, mimicking degron mutants iaa7/axr2-1 (P87S) or iaa12/bdl (P74S) in the

188

IAA7 or IAA12 chimeras (7-7-7m-7-7, 12-12-12m-12-12) abolished their association

189

with TIR1 (Fig. 2a). Exchanging the disordered degron tail of IAA7 (36 aa) for the one

190

in IAA12 (49 aa) IAA(7-7-7-12-7) does not affect interaction with TIR1. A IAA(12-12-

191

12-12-7-12) chimera however, associated with TIR1 much more efficiently, and in an

192

auxin-dependent manner than wild type IAA(12-12-12-12-12). Similarly, PB1 domain

193

exchanges between IAA7 or IAA12 affected positively the ability of the IAA(12-12-12-

194

12-7) chimera to interact with TIR1. To investigate interdependency of the degron tail

195

and the PB1 domain, we exchanged the flexible degron tail of IAA12 together with its

196

corresponding PB1 domain, and fused them to IAA7 IAA(7-7-7-12-12). In this case,

197

TIR1·IAA(7-7-7-12-12) interaction is greatly affected, while TIR1·IAA(12-12-12-7-7)

198

interaction, although weak, remains stronger than TIR1·IAA(12-12-12-12-12)

199

association. Next, we omitted the degron tails in either the wild type proteins or in the

200

PB1-swapped versions. In both instances, when IAA7 lacks its native degron tail

201

irrespective of the PB1 it carries, (7-7-7-Δ-7 or 7-7-7-Δ-12) basal interactions with TIR1

202

do not occur and auxin-dependent interactions are greatly diminished. On the other

Niemeyer, M., et al
203

hand, IAA(12-12-12-Δ-12) and IAA(12-12-12-Δ-7) chimeras invariably exhibit an

204

increased ability to interact with TIR1, independently of their expression level

205

(Supplementary Fig. 4). Surprisingly, in each case when we omitted the PB1 domain

206

of IAA7 chimeras, we observed strong interactions with TIR1. This coincidently

207

supports previous observations where removal of the folded PB1 domain in several

208

AUX/IAAs resulted in accelerated auxin-induced turnover

209

this effect is due to high order complexes the PB1 domains engage in, which might

210

negatively influence AUX/IAA processing in yeast 29. Hence, when the PB1 domain is

211

omitted, chimeric proteins seem to be unhindered by oligomeric interactions and

212

readily interact with TIR1 in yeast. Of note, independently of the layout of the core

213

degron, either GWPPVR in IAA7 or GWPPIG in IAA12, the IAA7 degron tail and PB1

214

combo of IAA7 favor auxin-dependent TIR1∙AUX/IAA chimera interactions

215

(Supplementary Fig. 5). Taking together, auxin-dependent and –independent

216

interactions are influenced by both the degron tail and the PB1 domain, as they

217

probably act in concert.

218

In order to address whether accessibility of IDRs and the PB1 domain in AUX/IAAs

219

affect the outcome of TIR1·AUX/IAA interactions, we carried out in vitro radioligand

220

binding assays. We used recombinant TIR1 as well as IAA7 and IAA12 chimeric or

221

iaa7bm3 and iaa12bm3 mutant proteins. While auxin binding affinities of

222

TIR1·iaa7bm3 and TIR1·IAA(7-7-7-7-12) complexes are reduced when compared to

223

the TIR1·IAA7 co-receptor system (TIR1·iaa7bm3 = Kd ~53 and TIR1·IAA(7-7-7-7-12)

224

= Kd 45 nM vs. TIR1·IAA7 Kd ~23 nM), we observed similar auxin affinities of

225

TIR1·iaa12bm3 and TIR1·IAA12 co-receptors (Kd ~195 nM vs. 226 nM, respectively)

226

(Fig. 2b-d, Supplementary Fig. 6). This indicates that homotypic interactions in the

227

case of IAA12 might not interfere with the auxin binding properties of an IAA1212

29.

It has been postulated

containing auxin co-receptor. The decrease in the auxin binding affinity of

229

TIR1·iaa7bm3 and TIR1·IAA(7-7-7-7-12) co-receptors hints to a positive effect of the

230

IAA7 PB1 domain on auxin sensing (Fig. 2b and d). Exchange of disordered degron

231

tails in chimeric IAA7 and IAA12 altered the affinity for auxin. The degron tail of IAA12

232

in the IAA7 context, IAA(7-7-7-12-7), reduces by two-fold auxin binding affinity of the

233

receptor (Fig. 2b-d). Conversely, the disordered degron tail of IAA7 in an IAA12

234

context, IAA(12-12-12-7-12), appears to enhance AUX/IAA contribution to an auxin

235

receptor. This is consistent with our Y2H data, where we observed a unique positive

236

effect of the IAA7 PB1 domain. Taken together, our data confirm the postulated

237

interdependency of the degron tail and PB1 domain, and further point to additive and

238

separate effects of each disordered degron tail and the PB1 domain on auxin-

239

independent and auxin-triggered TIR1 interaction.

240
241

IDRs in AUX/IAAs harbor ubiquitylation sites or facilitate their accessibility

242

To investigate differences in ubiquitylation dynamics, and reveal whether the

243

disordered nature of IAA7 and IAA12 influences their ubiquitylation rate, we

244

recapitulated auxin-triggered and SCFTIR1-dependent IAA7 and IAA12 ubiquitylation

complexes (i.e. 25 nM to 155 nM) (Fig. 2d) and at higher, saturating conditions (Fig.

248

3, Supplementary Fig. 7). Ubiquitin-conjugates on IAA7 and IAA12 were traceable

249

10 min after incubation, and their ubiquitylation is accelerated in an auxin-dependent

250

manner. We observed robust SCFTIR1-mediated IAA7 ubiquitylation even in the

251

absence of auxin, which can be explained by previously reported basal TIR1·IAA7

252

interactions

We traced IAA7 and IAA12 ubiquitylation over time and covered IAA concentrations

IAA12~ubiquitin conjugates were much less abundant than IAA7 after

30 min incubation (Fig. 3a). Once an auxin concentration above the Kd for the

254

TIR1·IAA12 (±150 nM) co-receptor complex is reached however, the differences in

255

ubiquitin conjugation on IAA7 and IAA12 are negligible over time. Reaching an auxin

256

concentration of 1 µM corresponding to at least 50-times the Kd of TIR1·IAA7, and 4-

257

5-times the Kd of TIR1·IAA12 for IAA (Fig. 2d), AUX/IAA ubiquitylation becomes solely

258

time-dependent. We conclude IAA7 and IAA12 ubiquitylation occurs rapidly, and the

259

differences in ubiquitylation dynamics depend on the auxin binding affinity by their

260

corresponding receptors when in complex with TIR1. Given auxin to be a “molecular

261

glue” between TIR1·AUX/IAAs, we postulate auxin might be needed for increasing the

262

dwell-time of flexible AUX/IAAs on TIR1. This facilitates sampling of favorable

263

AUX/IAA conformations allowing efficient ubiquitin transfer to lysine residues.

264

Putative ubiquitin acceptor lysine residues along the IAA7 and IAA12 sequences are

265

enriched in the degron tail of IAA12, and the linker of IAA7, both of which appear to

266

lack a three dimensional (3D) structure (Fig. 3b). We aimed therefore at gaining

267

experimental evidence of IAA7 and IAA12 ubiquitylation sites, after in vitro

268

ubiquitylation (IVU) reactions, tryptic digest and LC/MS analysis. We were able to map

269

only few specific lysine residues on IAA7 and IAA12, which are differently distributed

270

along their sequence (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 1). Although IAA7 and IAA12

271

contain 24 and 18 lysine residues, respectively, only 3 and 6 of them were

272

ubiquitylated. While we observed only few ubiquitylated lysine residues at the AUX/IAA

273

N-terminus, most of the mapped ubiquitylation sites were located in the region

274

downstream of the degron, either in the PB1 domain in IAA7, or the degron tail in

275

IAA12. Even though 4 lysines are conserved in the PB1 domain of IAA7 and IAA12,

276

only the non-conserved residues appeared to be ubiquitylated in IAA7. The flexible

277

degron tail of IAA7 did not get ubiquitylated, whereas 4 out of 7 lysine residues in the

Niemeyer, M., et al
278

slightly longer disordered IAA12 degron tail could be mapped as ubiquitylation sites

279

(Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 1).

280

To further investigate whether the apparent structural divergence of IAA7 and IAA12

281

imposes restrictions to lysine access for ubiquitylation, we used chimeric IAA7 and

282

IAA12 proteins (Fig. 3c) in our IVU assay. As we aimed at visualizing absolute

283

differences in ubiquitin conjugation, we traced auxin-dependent ubiquitin conjugation

284

of chimeric AUX/IAAs at a fixed IAA concentration of 0.5 µM after 1 hour IVU reaction.

285

Exchanging the degron tails or the PB1 domains between IAA7 and IAA12 led to

286

differences in ubiquitylation profiles of chimeric proteins compared to their wild type

287

counterparts. This happens as we either added or subtracted regions that contain the

288

ubiquitin acceptor sites in the IAA7 and IAA12 chimeric proteins (Fig. 3c,

289

Supplementary Fig. 8). For instance, we detected an increase of ubiquitin conjugates

290

on IAA(7-7-7-12-7), which gains ubiquitylation sites due to the exchange of the IAA7

291

degron tail. Deleting the AUX/IAA degron tail or the PB1 domain in the chimeric

292

proteins results in an overall reduction of ubiquitin conjugates on targets. Versions of

293

IAA7 or IAA12 missing a degron tail and containing the PB1 domain of IAA12, IAA(7-

294

7-7-Δ-12) and IAA(12-12-12-Δ-12), do not undergo auxin-triggered ubiquitylation (Fig.

295

3c, Supplementary Fig. 8). Similarly, AUX/IAA versions containing the IAA7 degron

296

but lack a PB1 domain (IAA(7-7-7-7-Δ), IAA(12-12-12-7-Δ)) are not conjugated by

297

ubiquitin, probably due to the loss of the mapped ubiquitin acceptor sites (Fig. 3b).

298

Our IVU assays on AUX/IAA chimeras validate our findings showing that the IAA7 PB1

299

domain or the flexible IAA12 degron tail carry propitious ubiquitylation sites. Thus, we

300

postulate AUX/IAA ubiquitylation favorably occurs in exposed regions in IAA7 and

301

IAA12, when they are recruited by TIR1.

TIR1·AUX/IAA ensembles are guided by the degron, but tailored by flexible

304

degron flanking regions

305

Due to the relative lack of a stable 3D conformation, IDPs or proteins enriched in IDRs,

306

such as AUX/IAAs, represent a challenge for structural biology studies. During

307

interactions with target proteins, IDPs, particularly IDRs, may undergo conformational

308

changes that cannot be traced easily, or captured while happening

309

Arabidopsis SKP1 (ASK1)∙TIR1∙auxin∙degron crystal structure enlightened us on how

310

auxin is perceived, we lack information on the contribution of regions flanking the

311

AUX/IAA degron on auxin binding. Thus, without being able to structurally resolve

312

intrinsically disordered degron flanking regions, we are hindered in our understanding

313

of how AUX/IAA ubiquitylation targets are actually positioned on TIR1. This has

314

evidently far-reaching implications on SCFTIR1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and ubiquitin

315

transfer by an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme.

316

We aimed to elucidate the driving factors for ASK1∙TIR1∙AUX/IAA complex assembly

317

and to unveil how IDRs in AUX/IAAs influence positioning on TIR1. We pursued a

318

structural proteomics approach using chemical cross-linking coupled to mass

319

spectrometric analyses (XL-MS) (Fig. 4a). We assembled ASK1∙TIR1∙AUX/IAA

320

complexes containing either IAA7bm3 or IAA12bm3 proteins in the absence or

321

presence of auxin (IAA), and added the MS-cleavable cross-linker disuccinimidyl

322

dibutyric urea (DSBU). Reaction products were processed for mass spectrometric

323

analysis, which utilizes the characteristic fragmentation of DSBU to identify cross-

324

linked residues within the AUX/IAAs and the ASK1·TIR1·AUX/IAA complex

328

cross-links when compared to auxin-containing samples (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig.

329

10). In the presence of auxin, we identified two distinct clusters in TIR1 harboring

330

cross-linker-reactive amino acid side chains with IAA7 and IAA12 (Fig. 4b,

331

Supplementary Fig. 9). Cluster 1 comprises amino acid residues in LRR7 (217-229

332

aa), while cluster 2 consists of residues toward the TIR1 C-terminus located in LRR17-

333

18 (485-529 aa). The location of the clusters on two opposing surfaces of TIR1

334

suggests a rather extended fold of the AUX/IAA protein when bound to TIR1 (Fig. 4b).

335

The cross-linked residues along the sequences of ASK1∙TIR1∙IAA7bm3 or

336

ASK1∙TIR1∙IAA12bm3 show an enrichment of highly variable intra-molecular cross-

337

links within the AUX/IAAs (Fig. 4c-d). A low number of intra-protein cross-links along

338

the TIR1 sequence were detected as a consequence of its rigid solenoid fold, which

339

is in agreement with the ASK1∙TIR1 crystal structure (PDB: 2P1Q,

340

cross-links indicate that the cross-linker-reactive clusters in TIR1 mainly connect with

341

only a specific subset of AUX/IAA residues (Fig. 4b). Multiple IAA7 residues upstream

342

of the core degron, including the KR motif, preferably cross-linked to TIR1 cluster 2.

343

While residues downstream of the core degron, including the PB1 domain, positioned

344

towards TIR1 cluster 1 (Fig. 4c). IAA12 is similarly positioned on TIR1, but exhibits

345

even higher flexibility given the more diverse distribution of inter-protein cross-links

346

(Fig. 4d). This is also supported by the fact that we detected many more assemblies

347

for ASK1∙TIR1∙IAA12bm3 across replicates, than for the ASK1∙TIR1∙IAA7bm3

348

complex (Fig. 4c-d). In conclusion, our structural proteomics approach confirmed

349

AUX/IAAs IAA7 and IAA12 exhibit flexible conformations in solution (intra-protein

350

cross-links), and adopt an extended fold when bound to TIR1.

351

As we gained a better understanding on the extended fold of IAA7 and IAA12 on TIR1,

352

we wondered whether intrinsic disordered stretches flanking the degron might help to

coordinate positioning of the folded PB1 domain. An extended AUX/IAA configuration

354

on TIR1 would be particularly relevant for allowing K146 and K223 in the PB1 domain

355

of IAA7 to be readily available for ubiquitylation. In the case of IAA12, an assertive

356

extension of the degron tail would expose K91, K111, K116 and K120 for ubiquitin

357

attachment (Fig. 3b).

358
359

Conformational heterogeneity in flexible IDR steers AUX/IAA molecular

360

interactions

361

To further investigate how the intrinsic disorder in IAA7 and IAA12 influence their

362

positioning on ASK1∙TIR1, we combined our cross-linking information with a molecular

363

docking strategy (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 11). For that, we use available

364

structures for the PB1 domains of AUX/IAAs and ARFs

365

modeled PB1 domains of Arabidopsis IAA7 and IAA12 to the ASK1∙TIR1 complex,

366

applying distance restraints based on the cross-linking data (Fig. 5, Supplementary

367

Fig. 11). We also added an additional distance restraint reflecting the possible

368

conformational space covered by the respective degron tails. We visualized the impact

369

of the different restraints on the possible interaction interface of ASK1∙TIR1∙IAA7PB1

370

and ASK1∙TIR1∙IAA12PB1 by DisVis

371

distance restraints, we limit the number of ASK1∙TIR1∙AUX/IAAPB1 protein complexes,

372

therefore reducing their explored interaction space (Fig. 5).

373

Intriguingly, the relationship between the number of accessible complexes vs. the

374

number of restraints applied does not reveal a linear behavior, but shows a sharp drop

375

when the degron tail restraint is added to all cross-link-based restraints (Fig. 5a-b).

Comparing the groups of water-refined HADDOCK models lead to similar observations

Niemeyer, M., et al
377

and the best scoring groups were only sampled incorporating the degron tail restraint

378

(Supplementary Table 2). This indicates the disordered degron tail restricts the

379

conformational space explored by the PB1 domain (Supplementary Table 2,

380

Supplementary Fig. 11-12). The reduction of accessible ASK1∙TIR1∙IAA7PB1 and

381

ASK1∙TIR1∙IAA12PB1 complexes for docking is also reflected by the decreased space

382

that can be possibly occupied by the PB1 domain (Fig. 5c-d). Overall, cross-linking-

383

based docking of the PB1 domain of IAA12 on the ASK1∙TIR1 complex is less-defined,

384

and occupies a distinct conformational space than the ASK1∙TIR1∙IAA7PB1 complex.

385

In order to refine our docking data and identify the most energetically-favored

386

TIR1∙AUX/IAAPB1 assemblies, we carried out molecular dynamic simulations coupled

387

to free-binding energy calculations by MM/GBSA. We used as a starting structure (t=0)

388

the results from the HADDOCK simulations including the degron tail restraint, and

389

performed 20 ns simulations for each TIR1·IAA7PB1 or TIR1·IAA12PB1 complex (Fig. 6

390

a-b). We obtained the effective binding free energy every 1 ps for each simulation,

391

and observed distinct average effective energy (ΔGeff) for the different groups in each

392

system (protein complex). Group 1 for TIR1·IAA7PB1 and groups 1 and 3 for

393

TIR1·IAA12PB1 turned out to be energetically less favored, while groups 2 in each case

394

showed the lowest binding energy. This indicates groups 2 likely depict the most

395

probable ensembles (Fig. 6 a-b). To identify relevant residues in groups 2 favoring

396

TIR1·AUX/AA interactions, we carried out per-residue effective energy decomposition

397

analysis (prEFED) followed by validation via computational alanine scanning (CAS)

398

(Fig. 6c, Supplementary Table 3). We found residues in TIR1 that might engage in

399

polar interactions with the AUX/IAA PB1 domain. D119, D170, V171, S172, H174,

400

H178, S199, R220 along the LRR3-6 in TIR1 likely contribute to stabilization of the

401

TIR1·IAA7 PB1 complex. Residues H174, H178, S199 also stabilized TIR1·IAA12 PB1

interactions together with R156, S177, S201, and R205 in TIR1 LRR4-6 (Fig. 6c-d,

403

Supplementary Fig. 13).

404

Next, we assessed empirically whether the in silico identified TIR1 residues contribute

405

to TIR1·AUX/IAA interaction. We generated mutant TIR1 proteins and evaluated their

406

interaction with either ASK1 or IAA7 and IAA12 in Y2H assays (Fig. 6e). We aimed at

407

identifying residues in cluster 1 at the TIR1 NTD and cluster 2 in TIR1 CTD (Fig. 4b),

408

which might provide non-native interaction interfaces with either the PB1 domain or

409

the KR motif of AUX/IAA proteins, respectively (Fig. 6c-e, Supplementary Table 3).

410

Mutations R156E, as well as S201A, and S205A either abolished or drastically

411

impaired basal TIR1·IAA7 and auxin-driven TIR1·IAA7 and TIR1·IAA12 associations,

412

without affecting ASK1·TIR1 assembly. This allowed us to postulate that the

413

positioning of the PB1 domain of AUX/IAAs on a specific NTD region in TIR1 might

414

have a favorable effect as part of the target recruitment mechanism. Specifically, IAA7

415

and IAA12 PB1 “piggy tails” might be in contact with R156 in TIR1. On the other hand,

416

mutations S172A, H174A, E197A, S199A, and R220A impaired ASK1·TIR1 and

417

TIR1·IAA7, as well as TIR1·IAA12 interactions. This data suggests these mutations

418

causing a long range effect on TIR1 activity and probably its overall conformational

419

stability, that is however independent on TIR1 expression levels (Fig. 6f). While D170

420

offered one of the best CAS scores (Supplementary Table 3), D170K mutation

421

probably corresponds to a null allele, as it leads to a reduction of protein levels, and a

422

complete disruption of TIR1 associations (Fig. 6c, e-f).

423

Among the mutants tested, we also included a reversed charge exchange for D481,

424

which is located in a negative charged patch in cluster 2 of TIR1 (Fig. 4b). According

425

to our cross-linking data, this exposed patch (incl. D481, S482, E459 or E506) might

426

exert electrostatic interactions with a conserved Lys-Arg (KR) dipeptide located

Our interaction studies combined with a structural proteomics approach demonstrated

IDRs in IAA7 and IAA12 harbor specific features that support TIR1·AUX/IAA

tail and the PB1 domain act in concert to secure AUX/IAA on TIR1, thereby modulating

auxin binding dynamics and likely enabling efficient ubiquitin transfer.

Discussion

440

Auxin is perceived by the FBP TIR1 and its ubiquitylation targets the AUX/IAA

441

transcriptional repressors. While TIR1 adopts a compact solenoid fold, AUX/IAAs

442

appear flexible and modular in nature as they engage in various protein interaction

443

networks

444

TIR1, securing auxin in place. To date, we lacked information on whether additional

445

physical interactions between TIR1·AUX/IAAs influence conformation and fate. We

446

also did not know whether additional partner interactions facilitate the formation of the

447

final auxin receptor complex by a two-dimensional search on the part of TIR1 on the

448

AUX/IAA surface or vice versa. We found IAA7 and IAA12 exhibit conformational

449

flexibility due to the presence of IDRs along their sequence. From the TIR1·auxin·IAA7

450

degron structure, we observed the degron adopts a slight helical structure 20. Our data

451

shows this semihelical peptide is embedded in an intrinsically disordered stretch,

452

which represent ~50% of the AUX/IAA sequence, and winds down in the well-folded

453

PB1 domain.

454

We showed IAA7 and IAA12 have properties of a molten globule, or a loosely packed

455

and highly dynamic conformational fold. Although IAA7 and IAA12 might exhibit

456

conformational heterogeneity, we observed that, while in solution, they maintain

457

unprecedented flexibility that seems to favor recruitment by the SCFTIR1.

458

Computational and experimental studies have shown IDRs such as those in

459

AUX/IAAs, act as inter-domain linkers contributing to protein-protein interactions by

460

exclusively or partially forming binding interfaces

461

and IAA12 with TIR1 captured by XL-MS allowed us to visualize AUX/IAAs “kissing

462

and embracing” TIR1 (Fig. 7). While the degron drives auxin-mediated interactions,

463

the IDR upstream of the degron and the PB1 domain engage in transient interactions

464

with the CTD, and the NTD of TIR1, respectively. A directional embrace of TIR1 by an

465

open-armed AUX/IAA, strengthened by degron-flanking IDRs, is initiated by a

466

TIR1·auxin·degron kiss or vice versa. This is remarkable indeed, as we show for the

467

first time that the PB1 domain may contact the TIR1 surface.

468

Signaling proteins carrying IDRs with mostly polar and charged residues seem to have

469

evolved more rapidly than ordered sequences, allowing increased functional

470

complexity

471

but not for AUX/IAAs degron tails. Although IAA7 and IAA12 show differences on IDR

472

content and length, both embraced TIR1 in a similar manner. Despite the fact that the

473

degron tail in IAA12 is third longest in the AUX/IAA family (49 aa) and about ~1.3 times

474

longer than the tail of IAA7 (36 aa), both offer flexibility (Supplementary Fig. 14). An

475

introduced degron length constraint in IAA7 and IAA12 greatly reduced the sampled

476

conformational space of IAA7 and IAA12 on TIR1. Finally, degron tails seem to

477

increase the interaction surface with TIR1, which we anticipate translates into

478

variability of binding kinetics.

479

Within the Arabidopsis AUX/IAA protein family, nearly half of the degron tails are

480

between 20-40 aa long and show high disorder probability (Supplementary Fig. 1).

481

Seven of the 23 degron-containing AUX/IAAs (IAA19, IAA4, IAA6, IAA5, IAA1, IAA2,

482

IAA15), however, carry a relatively ordered degron tail shorter than 20 amino acids

483

(Supplementary Fig. 14). Is that specific length an evolutionary constraint for TIR1

484

association? Auxin-dependent gene regulation, and AUX/IAA proteins appear in the

485

land plant lineage over 500 mya

486

two ancestral AUX/IAAs in moss and Marchantia

487

are not much longer than the average degron tails (40 aa) of Arabidopsis AUX/IAAs,

488

despite the overall length of these proteins being at least double that of angiosperm

48,49.

In our study, this applied to IDRs in regions upstream of the degron,

degron tails (less than 20 aa) can still offer tailored positioning on TIR1. Furthermore,

492

the degron tail might generate an entropic force

493

restricted by IDR length, modulating binding of AUX/IAAs to TIR1.

494

Particular stretches of amino acids with increased evolutionary conservation within

495

disordered segments have been found to determine interaction specificity, acting as

496

functional sites

497

upstream of the degron containing the auxin-responsive rate KR motif

498

exhibits a high level of conservation, and in addition to being part of a bipartite nuclear

499

localization signal (NLS), the KR contributes to assembly of a TIR1∙AUX/IAA auxin

500

receptor complex and, probably as a result, is required for basal proteolysis in planta

501

and AUX/IAA degradation dynamics 21,28,29,54. How mechanistically could the KR exert

502

an effect on TIR1 recognition and further AUX/IAA processing? Our findings lead us

503

to propose an answer to a more than 10 year’s long standing question. As part of the

504

AUX/IAA embrace of TIR1, the KR motif embedded in the IDR upstream of the degron

505

offers alternative contacts with the CTD of TIR1 and probably first binding contacts

506

(Fig. 7). Previous studies showed that moving the KR motif closer to the degron was

507

not sufficient to accelerate AUX/IAA degradation rate 29. We predict a high flexibility of

508

the IDR offers a necessary distance between the KR and the core degron for reaching

509

distinct TIR1 contact sites. So, the positively charged KR motif in AUX/IAAs may be

510

capable of engaging in electrostatic interactions with a cluster of highly charged (Asp,

511

Glu) residues in TIR1 between LRR16 and LRR18, where D481 is located. While TIR1

512

and AFB1 offer similar contact points to the KR in AUX/IAAs, AFB2 and AFB3 exhibit

513

opposite charged residues (Lys) that however might still provide charge-charge

This seems to precisely apply to the region in AUX/IAAs

interactions with a specific subset of AUX/IAAs. It remains to be determined whether

515

this is an additional feature facilitating differential auxin sensing by distinct

516

TIR1/AFBs·AUX/IAA co-receptor combinations 21.

517

Local flexibility in AUX/IAAs is evidently shaping their conformation when in complex

518

with TIR1. Specifically, flexible IDRs flanking the core degron in AUX/IAAs, as shown

519

for IAA7 and IAA12, serve as variable spacers between the degron and the well-folded

520

PB1 domain. Our data provide evidence for dynamic allosteric modulation of a

521

TIR1·AUX/IAA auxin receptor complex by the folded-PB1 domain and IDRs in

522

AUX/IAAs. We could track positive but also negative cooperativity, due to the degron

523

tail and PB1 domain combo, fine-tuning conformational states of TIR1·IAA7 and

524

TIR1·IAA12 receptor pairs, respectively. Further long-range, probable allosteric,

525

effects are reflected into AUX/IAA turnover, when PB1 domain and degron tail act as

526

one element (Supplementary Fig. 5).

527
528

Structural disorder in AUX/IAA targets appears also to be instrumental for processivity

529

in ubiquitin transfer by the SCFTIR1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. This is crucial as once an active

530

E2-E3-target assembly has formed, spatial and geometric constraints such as

531

distance and orientation relative to the E3-bound primary degron limit ubiquitylation

532

surface and lysine selection for degradation 7. AUX/IAA sequence harbors a number

533

of putative ubiquitin acceptor lysines (~9% total sequence) (Supplementary Fig. 14).

534

Our data show that not all of these sites are favorable for ubiquitylation. Downstream

535

of the core degron, AUX/IAAs likely offer an attractive region for ubiquitin conjugation.

536

We predict either the PB1 or the degron tail facilitate the accessibility of receptor

537

residues that undergo ubiquitylation. Upon TIR1∙AUX/IAA interaction, IDRs either act

538

themselves as ubiquitylation acceptor sites (e.g. IAA12) or orient the PB1 domain25

located lysines as ubiquitin acceptor sites (e.g. IAA7). We cannot rule out however,

540

regulated and efficient ubiquitin transfer might prioritize target degradation at the

541

proteasome. This is key, as AUX/IAA turnover likely needs properly positioned

542

ubiquitin moieties at the proper distance of an IDR, and an IDR with unbiased

543

sequence composition as an initiation site for efficient degradation

544

understand this, it will be imperative to gain insights into where AUX/IAAs are

545

ubiquitylated in vivo, and where exactly the proteasome initiates degradation relative

546

to the ubiquitylation sites.

547

The effects of cooperative allostery driven by IDRs in AUX/IAA proteins might not be

548

limited to the TIR1·AUX/IAA interaction, but rather influence the assembly into other

549

complexes regulating auxin output signals

550

response to fluctuating cellular auxin concentrations, transient TIR1·AUX/IAA

551

interactions via IDRs alter the energy landscape of AUX/IAA·TPL, AUX/IAA·ARF and

552

AUX/IAA·AUX/IAA assemblies and/or possible decorations with PTMs. Future studies

553

will tell whether IDRs in AUX/IAAs, and the recently described IDRs in ARFs, affect

554

their protein assembly’s localization or activity

555

cooperativity resulting in a multiplicity of allosterically-regulated interactions within the

556

auxin signaling pathway, where AUX/IAAs act as signaling hubs within the different

557

complexes.

558

Using an XL-MS approach, we have captured for the first time a highly flexible

559

ubiquitylation target being engaged by an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which at the

560

same time, constitutes a phytohormone receptor. Our strategy offers an opportunity to

561

visualize how IDR-driven allostery might influence a complex signaling network.

Methods

563

Phylogenetic tree generation and secondary structure analysis

564

Phylogenetic tree construction was done using Clustal Omega60 with standard settings

565

and the full-length protein sequences of all Arabidopsis AUX/IAAs deposited at

566

uniprot61. The constructed tree was visualized by iTOL62 and manually edited. In silico

567

disorder analysis was performed with the web-based IUPred2A tool32 utilizing

568

AUX/IAA protein sequences. The resulting disorder probability was used to categorize

569

each residue as either ordered (<0.4), intermediate (0.4-0.6) or disordered (>0.6).

570

Same analysis was done for all AUX/IAA proteins excluding the PB1 domain using the

571

conserved VKV motif as the start of the PB1 domain. Residues of each category were

572

plotted using R. IAA7 and IAA12 disorder predictions were additionally carried out

573

using SPOT 63 and PrDOS 64 algorithms with standard settings. Hydropathy plots were

574

generated via Expasy-linked ProtScale 65,66 using the Kyte-Doolittle method 67.

575
576

Protein purification

577

ASK1·TIR1 complex was purified from Sf9 cells as described earlier

578

changes. In brief, ASK1 was co-purified with GST-TIR1 using GSH affinity

579

chromatography (gravity flow) and anion chromatography (MonoQ) followed by Tag-

580

removal and a final size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) step (Superdex 200), using

581

an ÄKTA FPLC system.

582

AUX/IAA proteins, including chimeric versions, were expressed as GST-tagged

583

proteins in E.coli and purified using GSH affinity chromatography, including a high salt

584

wash (1M NaCl) and gravity flow anion exchange chromatography (Sepharose Q). For

585

circular dichroism, the GST-tag was removed on the GSH column matrix with

586

thrombin, and fractions containing AUX/IAAs were briefly concentrated, passed over

588

with an ÄKTA FPLC system. This step was carried out using the CD measurement

589

buffer (see CD measurement section) for buffer exchange.

590
591

Size exclusion chromatography and size calculations

592

The last protein purification step was used to simultaneously determine the Stokes

593

radii of AUX/IAAs in CD buffer (10 mM KPi pH 7.8; 150 mM KF; 0.2 mM TCEP). The

594

HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 high resolution column was calibrated using gel

595

filtration standards (Bio-Rad, Cat. #151-1901) with added BSA before the runs. Stokes

596

radii for the globular known reference proteins were calculated as described 68. The

597

Stokes radii of AUX/IAA variants were calculated from the resulting calibration curve

598

equation based on their retention volume (n = 4-9).

599
600

Circular Dichroism (CD) measurements

601

After purification, including tag-removal and size exclusion chromatography,

602

AUX/IAAs were concentrated and adjusted to 2.5 - 5 µM in CD buffer. CD

603

measurements were carried out on a Jasco CD J-815 spectrometer and spectra were

604

recorded from 260 nm to 185 nm as 32 accumulations using a 0.1 nm interval and 100

605

nm/min scanning speed. Cell length was 1 mm and temperature was set to 25°C. All

606

spectra were buffer corrected using CD buffer as a control and converted to mean

607

residual ellipticity (MRE). Reference spectra for a disordered (MG-14; PCDDBID:

608

CD0004055000), a beta-sheet (BtuB; PCDDBID: CD0000102000) and an alpha-

609

helical protein (amtB; PCDDBID: CD0000099000) were used.

Radioligand binding assays were performed as previously described 69 using purified

613

ASK1·TIR1 protein complexes, GST-tagged AUX/IAAs incl. chimeric AUX/IAAs and

614

[3H]IAA with a specific activity of 25 Ci/mmol (Hartmann Analytic). Final protein

AUX/IAAs. Complexes were allowed to form 1 h on ice, shaking. For non-specific

617

binding controls, reactions contained additionally 2 mM cold IAA. Data was evaluated

LexA Yeast Two Hybrid Assays

622

LexA-based yeast two hybrid assays were performed using yeast transformed with the

623

described constructs (DBD-fusions: EGY48+pSH18-34, pGILDA vector; AD-fusions:

624

YM4271, pB42AD vector), freshly mated and grown on selection medium (Gal/Raff –

625

Ura –His –Trp). Same amount of yeast cells (OD600 = 0.4 or 0.8 for IAA12(-like)) were

626

spotted on selection plates containing BU salts (final: 7 g/L Na2HPO4, 3 g/L NaH2PO4,

627

pH 7), X-Gal (final 80 mg/L) and the given auxin (IAA) concentration. Plates were

628

incubated at 30°C for several days and constantly monitored. Expression of chimeric

629

AUX/IAAs and TIR1 mutants in yeast were checked using immunoblot analysis on

630

lysates from haploid yeast. 50 mL liquid selection medium (Gal/Raff -Ura -His or -Trp)

631

were inoculated with an 1/25 volume overnight culture and grown till OD 600 ≈ 0.6,

632

harvested, washed with water and lysed in 200 µL lysis buffer (0.1 M NaOH, 2 % β-

633

mercaptoethanol, 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.05 M EDTA, 200 µM benzamidine, 1

634

mM PMSF, Roche protease inhibitor cocktail) at 90°C for 10 min. After neutralization

635

with 5 µL 4 M sodium acetate for 10 min at 90°C, 50 µL 4X Laemmli was added and

636

samples were separated via SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted.

In vitro reconstitution of Ub-conjugation

638

In vitro ubiquitylation (IVU) reactions were performed as previously described 31. In

639

brief two protein mixtures (mix A and mix B) were prepared in parallel. Mix A contained

640

50 µM ubiquitin (Ub; Fluorescein-labeled UbS20C: UbK0; 4:1 mix), 0.2 µM 6xHis-UBA1

641

(E1) and 2 µM 6xHis-AtUBC8 (E2) in reaction buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM

642

NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 µM ZnCl2, 2 mM ATP). Mix B contained 1 µM

643

Cul1∙RBX1, 1µM ASK1∙TIR1, and 5 µM AUX/IAA protein in reaction buffer. Mix B was

644

aliquoted and supplemented with IAA to reach the indicated final concentration.

645

Mixtures A and B were separately incubated for 5 or 10 minutes at 25 °C, respectively.

646

Equal volumes of mix A and B were combined, aliquots were taken at specified time

647

points, and reactions were stopped by denaturation in Laemmli buffer. IVUs with

648

chimeric AUX/IAAs were carried out 1 h with 1 µM IAA. Immunodetection of Ub-

649

conjugated proteins was performed using polyclonal anti-GST in rabbit (Sigma,

650

G7781; 1:20,000) antibodies combined with secondary anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor® Plus

651

647 antibody (1:20,000) (Thermo Fischer Scientific, A32733). Detection was

652

performed with a Typhoon FLA 9500 system (473 nm excitation wavelength and LPB

653

filter for fluorescein-labeled ubiquitin signal detection and 635 nm excitation

654

wavelength and LPR filter for GST signal).

655

Quantification of ubiquitylated AUX/IAAs was performed using the in-gel fluorescein

656

signal above GST-IAA7 and GST-IAA12, as well as the ubiquitin-modified Cullin (~50

657

kDa) were quantified for each lane using ImageQuant TL software automatic lane

658

detection. The reduction of unmodified GST-IAA7 and GST-IAA12 fusion proteins was

659

quantified after blotting and immunodetection using the Alexa Fluor 647 signal, and

660

automatic band detection. All signals were background subtracted (rubberband

661

method).

LC-MS analyses of IVU reactions

663

Three sets of IVUs, corresponding to three biological replicates, were carried out on

664

consecutive weeks using AUX/IAA proteins from different batch preparations. After 30

665

minutes, IVUs were stopped by denaturing with urea, reduced with DTT and alkylated

666

with iodoacetamide. Trypsin digestion was carried out overnight at 37°C. Upon

667

quenching and desalting, peptides were separated using liquid chromatography C18

668

reverse phase chemistry and later electrosprayed on-line into a QExactive Plus mass

669

spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS/MS peptide sequencing was performed

670

using a Top20 DDA scan strategy with HCD fragmentation. Ubiquitylated residues on

671

identified peptides were mapped using GG and LRGG signatures (as tolerated

672

variable modifications) from using both the Mascot software v2.5.0 (Matrix Science)

673

linked to Proteome Discoverer v1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the MaxQuant

Cross-linking reactions

679

DSBU (ThermoFisher) cross-linking reactions were performed for 1 h at 25°C with

680

either 4-5 µM of ASK1·TIR1 and 5 µM iaa7bm3 or iaa12bm3 or 10 µM iaa7bm3 or

681

iaa12bm3 alone. Proteins were pre-incubated 15 minutes in the presence or absence

682

of 10 µM auxin (IAA) before addition of 1 mM DSBU (100 molar excess). After TRIS

683

quenching, samples were sonicated in the presence of sodium deoxycholate, reduced

684

with DTT, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Alkylation was quenched by DTT, and

685

the reactions were incubated with trypsin over night at 37°C. Digestion was stopped

followed by high-resolution product ion scans (R = 30,000), starting with the most

703

intense signal in the full-scan mass spectrum (isolation window 2 Th); the target value

Cross-link-based docking using HADDOCK

722

Comparative models of IAA7 and IAA12 PB1 domains were created using multi-

723

sequence-structure-alignments (PIR formatted) as input for MODELLER 0.921 70. The

724

generated models were incorporated for the HADDOCK-based docking together with

725

the available ASK1∙TIR1 structure (PDB code: 2P1Q, resolution: R= 1.91 Å)20. A

726

detailed description how to prepare pdb files and incorporated distance restraint can

727

be found elsewhere. Formatted pdb files were uploaded to the HADDOCK server 71,72

728

using guru access level. To incorporate distance restraints, we used distances from

729

intramolecular cross-links of known distance (see SUPP file docking parameters). We

730

further added a distance restraint or not corresponding to the degron tail length

731

calculated as described

732

structures were generated followed by a second iteration (400 best structures). Finally,

733

200 models/structures were water refined (explicit solvent) and clustered (FCC74 at

One refined structure of each group, derived from the cross-link-based docking by

741

HADDOCK incorporating the disorder restraint (2 groups for IAA7PB1∙TIR1; 3 groups

742

for IAA12PB1∙TIR1), was used as starting structure for MD simulations. The 5 structures

were prepared using structure preparation and protonate 3D (pH = 7.5) modules and

744

subsequently minimized with AMBER10 force-field in MOE 2019.0101 (Chemical

745

Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada).

Molecular dynamic simulations were performed with the GROMACS software package

747

(version 4.6.5)78. The parameters corresponding to the proteins were generated with

749

electro-neutrality was guaranteed with a NaCl concentration of 0.2 mol/L. The protocol

750

employed here to perform MD simulations involves prior energy minimization and

position-restrained equilibration, as outlined by Lindahl 81 for lysozyme in water. Once

the system was equilibrated, we proceeded to the productive dynamic simulation

𝐺𝐵𝑂𝐵𝐶2 implicit solvation models were employed82. The accumulated mean value of

761

Δ𝐺𝑒𝑓𝑓 were obtained every 10 ps from the productive MD simulation.

762

Energetically-relevant residues (hot-spots) at the interfaces of TIR1·AUX/IAA PB1

763

complexes were predicted by using the per-residue effective free energy

764

decomposition (prEFED) protocol implemented in MMPBSA.py

765

were defined as those with a side-chain energy contribution (Δ𝐺𝑠𝑐 ) of ≤ -1.0 kcal/mol.

766

We used Computational Alanine Scanning (CAS)82 to further assess per-residue free

767

energy contributions. Alanine single-point mutations were generated on previously

768

identified hot-spots from the prEFED protocol. Both prEFED and CAS protocols were

769

performed from the last 10 ns of the MD simulation.

1041

ubiquitylation is auxin-driven and time-dependent. Basal ubiquitylation (auxin-

1042

independent) of IAA7 starts in less than 30 mins. Ubiquitylation was monitored using

1043

the ubiquitin fluorescent signal (green), and anti-GST/Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated

1044

antibodies for detection of GST-AUX/IAAs (red). ImageQuantTL software was used

1045

for quantification (middle), and generation of merged image (bottom). (b) IAA7 and

1046

IAA12 IVU samples were analyzed via LC-MS, and putative ubiquitylation sites

1047

detected by the diGly (or LRGG) Ub remnant after tryptic digest, were mapped

relative to the domain structure. IAA12 Ub sites agglomerate in the region upstream

1066

Cross-links were identified in at least 2/3 or 3/4 independent experiments (dashed:

1067

2/3 and 3/4; solid lines: 3/3 and 4/4). High number of intra-protein cross-links (red)

1068

within AUX/IAAs show a high degree of flexibility characteristic of intrinsically

1069

disordered regions (IDRs). Specific cross-links within TIR1 are in agreement with the

1070

crystal structure (PDB: 2P1Q). Inter-protein crosslinks (blue) in the ASK1·TIR1·IAA7

1071

complex mainly occurred between the N-terminus of IAA7 and the C-terminus of

1072

TIR1. Regions downstream of the IAA7 and IAA12 degron preferably cross-linked

1073

with a distinct region on TIR1 (K217, K226, T229). Known motifs and protein

1074

domains are displayed. High variability in TIR1·IAA12 cross-links hints toward a

1075

flexible and less-defined interaction interface, which reflect on the low auxin binding

1076

affinity of a TIR1·IAA12 co-receptor complex.

is much broader than the IAA7 PB1. This is an evidence the conformational space

for the IAA7 PB1 on TIR1 is much more restricted, especially when the degron tail

1112

flanking the AUX/IAA core degron. The F-Box Protein TIR1 of the SCFTIR1 E3

1113

ubiquitin ligase recruits AUX/IAA targets for their ubiquitylation and degradation. The

1114

phytohormone auxin and a core degron in AUX/IAAs are essential for AUX/IAA

1115

recognition. Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) flanking the degron provide high

1116

flexibility and an extended fold to AUX/IAAs, and influence TIR1·AUX/IAA complex

1117

formation. At least two different routes are possible for dynamic AUX/IAA recruitment

1118

and UPS-mediated degradation: i) auxin-triggered association between TIR1 and the

1119

core AUX/IAA degron paves the way for positioning adjacent IDRs, which exposes

1120

ubiquitin acceptor sites for efficient ubiquitylation; ii) transient auxin-independent

1121

interactions between IDRs, as well as the PB1 domain in AUX/IAAs and two patches

1122

of residues at opposite sides of TIR1, assist on auxin binding and offer tailored

1123

positioning. The residency time of an AUX/IAA target on TIR1, when assembled in

1124

an SCF-complex, propels processivity of AUX/IAA ubiquitylation, and impinges on

1125

availability of IDRs as initiation sites for degradation by the 26S proteasome.
