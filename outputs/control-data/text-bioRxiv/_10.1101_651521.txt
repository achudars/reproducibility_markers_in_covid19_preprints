ABSTRACT
Background and objectives: Cognitive deficits in MS are common, also early in the disease
course. We aimed to identify if estimated brain age from MRI could serve as an imaging
marker for early cognitive symptoms in a longitudinal MS study.
Methods: A group of 76 MS patients (mean age 34 years, 71% females, 96% relapsingremitting) was examined 1, 2 and 5 years after diagnosis. A machine-learning model using
Freesurfer-processed T1-weighted brain MRI data from 3208 healthy controls, was applied to
develop a prediction model for brain age. The difference between estimated and chronological
brain age was calculated (brain age gap). Tests of memory, attention and executive functions
were performed. Associations between brain age gap and cognitive performance were
assessed using linear mixed effects (LME) models and corrected for multiple testing.
Results: LME models revealed a significant association between the Color Naming condition
of Color-Word Interference Test and brain age gap (t=2.84, p=0.005).
Conclusions: In this study, decreased information processing speed correlated with increased
brain age gap. Our findings suggest that brain age estimation using MRI provides a useful
semi-automated approach applying machine learning for individual level brain phenotyping
and correlates with information processing speed in the early course of MS.

INTRODUCTION
MS is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS, mostly diagnosed in young adults.
Cognitive deficits, affecting up to 70 % of all MS patients, are associated with psychiatric
symptoms, reduced quality of life and ability to participate in work-related and social
activities 1. Cognitive deficits may appear early in the disease course and are only mildly
associated with physical disability 2, 3. The domains most frequently affected in MS are
information processing speed and memory, followed by executive functions, verbal fluency
and visuospatial processing 4-6.
MRI is an essential tool for diagnosing and monitoring of disease activity and
progression in MS 7, 8. MRI is highly sensitive to MS related pathological processes such as
inflammation, demyelination and loss of neurons and is an important tool for visualizing the
neuropathological substrates in MS 9.
Cross-sectional studies have revealed cognitive deficits to be associated with several
structural MRI (sMRI) markers. Longitudinal studies have shown correlation between corpus
callosum atrophy 10, thalamus atrophy 11, 12, whole-brain atrophy 13 and reduction in grey and
white matter volumes 14, 15 and cognitive performance. Especially, thalamus has shown to be
highly susceptible to retrograde degeneration and scan-scan correlations with longitudinal
data 16. Thalamus is recognized to be subject to atrophy from the earliest stages of MS,
especially for primary progressive (PP) MS patients but also in general for MS patients 14.
Thalamus structure has been linked to decline in cognitive performance in MS 12.
A multiparametric MRI study identified that deep reduced gray matter volume and
regional white matter atrophy were the strongest predictors of overall cognitive dysfunction in
MS 17. Cognitive decline is found to be associated with increase in T2 lesion volume, cerebral
atrophy, microstructural damage and cortical lesions 4.
Despite extensive research efforts concerning MRI markers in MS, most studies show
weak associations between neuroradiological disease markers and cognitive performance (the
cognitive clinico-radiological paradox)4, 18, 19. There is a need to establish new MRI markers
that robustly relate to cognitive function, with the ability to predict future progression and
monitor the effects of treatments on the individual level 4.
Brain age estimation has emerged as a robust MRI marker, combining sensitive
measures of MRI-based brain morphometry using machine learning models, to estimate an
individual brain age when correlating with a large MRI data set of healthy controls 20, 21.
Having an older-appearing brain is associated with advanced physiological and cognitive
ageing and mortality in several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders 20, 22, 23.

To our knowledge, no studies elaborating cognitive function in association with brain age in
MS have yet been performed.
By using data from our prospective, longitudinal study of newly diagnosed MS
patients, we aimed to evaluate if regional brain age estimation is sensitive to subtle changes in
cognitive performance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
In total 76 MS patients were recruited as described previously 15, 24. The patients were
diagnosed in 2009-2012 in accordance with the at that time current McDonald Criteria 25. The
patients were examined at three time points after being diagnosed with MS; time point 1 after
15 months (±12, n=76), time point 2 after 28 months (±9, n=75) and time point 3 after 66
months (±13, n=62). No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA-3) was defined as absence of
both clinical relapses, disease progression and new or contrast enhancing lesions on MRI.
Disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) were categorized within the following groups; no
treatment (group 0); glatiramer acetate, interferons, teriflunomide or dimetylfumarate (group
1) and fingolimod, natalizumab or alemtuzumab (group 2). The disease course was defined
according to the Lublin criteria 26.
MRI acquisition
All MS patients were scanned using the same 1.5 T scanner (Avanto, Siemens Medical
Solutions; Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 12-channel head coil for up to three times in
the study with the same MRI scanning sequence across all timepoints. Structural MRI data
were collected using a 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE (Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient
Echo) sequence, with the following parameters: TR (repetition time) / TE (echo time) / flip
angle / voxel size / FOV (field of view) / slices / scan time / matrix / time to inversion = 2400
ms / 3.61 ms / 8° / 1.20 x 1.25 x 1.25 mm / 240 / 160 sagittal slices / 7:42 minutes / 192 × 192
/ 1000 ms.
MRI pre and postprocessing
The MRI pre and postprocessing for this data has been described previously 24. Manual
quality control of the MRI scans from patients was performed by trained research personnel to
identify and edit segmentation errors where possible (done for 15 MRI scans) and exclude

data of insufficient quality or missing sequences (11 MRI scans). Lesions have been shown to
not substantially influence the output data from Freesurfer or the brain age estimations 24, 27.
Detailed information on MRI variables is given in supplementary material.
Brain age estimation model
Detailed information on the brain age estimation model has been described previously 21, 24.
To summarize we utilized a training set based on MRI scans from 3208 HC (54 % women,
mean age 47.5 (±19.8) years, age range 12-95 years) obtained from several publicly available
datasets and processed in the same MRI pipeline (Supplementary Fig. 1). Based on robust
performance in previous machine learning competitions we chose the xgboost package in R 28
to create the brain age estimation model. To estimate the performance of the estimation
model, a 10-fold cross-validation showed consistent performance and generalizability for the
combined model for both genders (r = 0.91, Supplementary Fig. 2).
Neuropsychological assessment
The participants were evaluated using a battery of 13 neuropsychological tests at all three
time points, detailed information regarding the tests can be found in the supplementary
material. Results from baseline and the first follow-up have been published previously 15, 29.
We used the raw scores in the analyses.
Statistical analysis
We used R (R Core Team, Vienna, 2018, version 3.7.0) for statistical analyses. To assess
reliability of brain age and cognitive tests across time we computed the intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC) using the R package “irr” (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=irr).
Figures were made using “ggplot2” 30 and “cowplot” (https://CRAN.Rproject.org/package=cowplot) in R.
The linear mixed effects (LME) models were performed using the R package “nlme”
(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlme). All LME models accounted for age, gender and
months since time point 1 31. To control for multiple testing, we calculated the degree of
independence between the resulting cognitive data only, by making a 13 x 13 correlation
matrix based on the Pearson´s correlation between all pair-wise combinations of the cognitive
variables. Utilizing the ratio of observed eigenvalue variance to its theoretical maximum, the
estimated equivalent number of independent traits in our analyses was 9.0 32. To control for

multiple testing, our significance threshold was therefore adjusted accordingly from 0.05 to
5.6 x 10-3 32.

RESULTS
Participant demographics and characteristics
A full summary of the demographic and clinical characteristics is provided in Table 1. At time
point 1, the MS patients had a mean age of 35.3 years (range 21.3-49.5 years), 71% were
females and they were diagnosed with MS 15 months previously (range 0-36 months). Mean
age increased to 36.3 (range 22.7-50.6 years) and 40.4 years (range 25.5-53.7 years) at time
point 2 and 3, respectively. 96% were diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).
NEDA-3 was achieved for a subset of 53% and 44% at time point 2 and 3, respectively. The
proportion of patients using group 1 DMTs decreased during follow-up period with 65%, 48
% and 37% at time point 1, 2 and 3. Correspondingly, the use of group 2 DMTs increased
among the subjects in the same time period from 13% at time point 1 to 23% and 32% at time
point 2 and 3.

Changes in brain age and brain morphometry over time
Summary statistics from the brain morphometry, cognitive tests and corresponding principal
component analysis (PCA) (see supplementary material) are provided in Table 2. Estimated
brain age gap (BAG, the difference between estimated and chronological brain age). increased
from 2.8 at time point 1 to 4.6 at time point 3 (LME estimated effect of time: t=0.36, p=0.72).
Both thalamus volume (t=-2.27, p=0.03) and normalized thalamus volume (t=2.73, p=7.2 x
10-3) showed significant longitudinal decrease. We also found significant decrease in white
matter volume (t=-2.30, p=0.02), normalized white matter volume (t=-3.56, p=5.3 x 10-4) and
normalized brain volume (t=-2.60, p=0.01). Raw morphometric volumes and normalized
volumes showed significant correlations with white matter volume (r=0.49, p=9.8 x 10-13) and
thalamus (r=0.59, p=2.2 x 10-16) and non-significant correlations with total brain volume
(r=0.08, p=0.25) and grey matter volume (r=0.07, p=0.37).

respectively. Both Color Naming (t=-4.25, p=4.3 x 10-5) and Word Reading (t=-3.47, p=7.2 x 10-4) displayed
significantly decreasing results across the time points, as measured by LME models.

Associations between brain age gap and cognitive performance
A summary of the multiple regressions analyses for associations between brain imaging
markers and the cognitive tests are provided in Table 3 (see Supplementary Table 4 for
complete results). After correcting for multiple testing there was a significant positive
association between the Color Naming condition of CWIT and estimated BAG across all time
points (t=2.84, p=5.4 x 10-3), indicating slower speed with higher brain age gap (Fig. 2). The
associations between BAG and the Color Naming condition of CWIT remained after
accounting for fatigue, years of education, disease duration, depressive symptoms, intracranial
volume (ICV) and raw scores from the vocabulary task of Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of
Intelligence. LME revealed no significant association between the longitudinal changes in the
Color Naming condition of CWIT and BAG (stats for the interaction term: t=0.68, p=0.50).

DISCUSSION
Using established machine learning methods for brain age estimation, we tested if estimated
brain age was associated with early cognitive decline in a longitudinal study of MS patients.
In addition, we investigated associations with established MRI features and cognitive
performance. We found that reduced information processing speed was associated with
increased brain age gap and smaller thalamus volumes for patients in the early course of MS.
Previous studies have shown that the first symptom of cognitive decline MS is impairment in
information processing speed 4, 33, as our results also suggest with associations between MRI
markers and decreased information processing speed. We show that brain age estimation

correlates with cognitive decline measured by information processing speed in the early
course of MS.
In our study, increasing brain age gap were significantly associated with slower
performance for the Color Naming condition of CWIT across all time points, corresponding
to an estimated 0.13 seconds increase in completion time for every year increase in brain age
gap. This finding is in line with a recent study reporting lower processing speed as measured
using the Stroop test with higher brain age gap in healthy individuals covering large parts of
the adult lifespan 22. Supporting the sensitivity to individual differences in relevant clinical
and cognitive traits, brain age gap has also been linked to negative symptoms in patients with
schizophrenia, cognitive impairment in patients with dementia, and symptom burden in
patients with MS 21. A study investigating brain age prediction over the lifespan revealed that
individuals with major objective cognitive impairment had 2.1 years higher estimated brain
age compared with a group of individuals with no objective cognitive impairment 23. Reduced
information processing speed is known to appear early and with an increasing prevalence
throughout the disease course of MS 4.
We found that reduced Word Reading condition of CWIT performance was
significantly associated with smaller thalamus volume across time points corresponding to
0.87 seconds slower completion time for every ml reduction in thalamus volume. Previous
studies have documented the importance of thalamic changes for cognitive performance in
MS 12 while a longitudinal study has shown thalamic atrophy to be evident from the earliest
stages in MS 14. Although the current results suggest a relevant role of the thalamus in
processing speed, the extended brain networks supporting cognitive function are distributed
and comprise large parts of the brain. Hence, combining information from various structures
and imaging modalities is likely to improve sensitivity. Indeed, increased sensitivity and
specificity to identify MS patients with severe cognitive impairment have been found when
including other MRI modalities, such as resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor
imaging 12, which is also in line with a study comparing the sensitivity to cognitive
performance between various brain age estimations based on different combinations of
structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging 22.
Our results did not uncover relevant associations between imaging variables and
SDMT. The SDMT is currently a widely used screening test for reduced information
processing speed in a clinical setting and is the suggested sentinel test for cognitive
impairment in MS 6, 33. The correlations between SDMT and the Color Naming and Word
Reading conditions of CWIT were significant in our study. The lack of significant

correlations between SDMT and the MRI markers across all time points might be due to the
fact that our patients were at an early stage in their disease course. In accordance with the
national guidelines for MS care in Norway, a large proportion of the MS patients in this study
were treated with high efficacy DMTs from early on, possibly resulting in the higher number
of NEDA patients in the study. As described earlier, on average our MS patients even
performed better on some cognitive domains compared to healthy controls 15. In the same
study, patients with NEDA had on average stable cognitive performances one year after the
first visit 15. Findings from another MS sample also related lower depressive symptoms with
improved cognitive performance 3.
No significant longitudinal correlations between changes in MRI parameters and
cognitive test performance after the five year follow-up were found. One contributing factor
to this might be the subtle cognitive and morphological changes observed in our patients.
Significant improvements were found across the larger part of our administered cognitive
tests at time point 1, 2 and 3. These improvements were most likely due to practice-related
effects 34. Similar increases in test performance was also observed for SDMT in a study of
Danish MS patients, where they found continuous enhancement after repeated monthly testing
and more pronounced practice effect at lower EDSS levels 35.
Some additional limitations have to be considered when interpreting our results. First,
we did not have access to longitudinal matched healthy controls, which would have enabled
us to directly compare both the brain imaging and cognitive data across time points. Secondly,
our current brain age estimation model was based solely on structural brain imaging data
whereas some studies have shown increased precision when incorporating additional imaging
modalities such as diffusion tensor imaging and functional MRI. In addition, the study does
not allow us to make causal interference.
To conclude, this longitudinal MS study showed reduced information processing
speed to be associated with increased brain age gap for patients in the early course of MS. Our
results fit with previous findings, where reduced information speed is found to be an early
symptom of cognitive decline in MS. In conclusion, we show that brain age estimation using
MRI provides a useful semi-automated method for individual level brain phenotyping and
correlates with cognitive decline measured by information processing speed.
