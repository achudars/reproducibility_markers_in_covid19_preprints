Abstract
The early mammalian conceptus (blastocyst) contains two supporting extraembryonic tissues - the
trophectoderm and the primitive endoderm (PrE) - that encase and guide the epiblast (Epi) to
eventually form the all body. Modifications of the conceptus exposed key genes regulating these
tissues co-development. However, the combinations of signalling pathways underlying the interplay
of PrE and Epi remains elusive. Stem cell-based models including embryoid bodies and blastoids
can be generated in large numbers and subjected to high-content screens. Here, we use
combinatorial screens of proteins, GPCR ligands and small molecules to rapidly (72 hours) and
efficiently (80%) guide embryoid bodies to form a three-dimensional PrE-/Epiblast-like niche in
chemically-defined conditions (gel-free, serum-free). This bipotent niche spontaneously progresses,
without growth factors, to form a pro-amniotic cavity surrounded by a polarized Epi covered with
parietal and visceral endoderm-like cells. In blastoids, these molecules enhance the ratio and
number of Gata6+/Nanog+ cells and promote the survival, expansion and morphogenesis of a
post-implantation-like Epi ​in vitro​. Altogether, modelling early development in chemically-defined
conditions delineates the pathways sufficient to form a functional PrE/Epiblast niche that fuels
post-implantation development.

Introduction
The early mammalian conceptus consists of three lineages: the pluripotent Epiblast (Epi) that
forms the embryo proper, and the two extraembryonic lineages — trophoblast and primitive endoderm

(PrE) — that contribute to the placenta and yolk sac, respectively​1,2​. In mice, the bifurcation between PrE
and Epi cells is established in a seemingly sequential and synergistic manner between E3.25 and E4.5​3–6​ 7​​ ,
and marked by the timed expression of transcription factors Gata6, PDGFRα, Gata4, Sox17, and Sox7​2,8,9​.
Experiments using ​in vivo​ and ​in vitro​ models suggested that this process is initiated by lineage priming​10
exploiting polycombs​11​, chromatin modifiers​12​ and small-RNAs​13​ activities, along with the progression of
gene regulatory networks​2​ and intercellular signalling circuitries (e.g. FGF/Mapk/Erk​5,10,14–21​ and
Lif/Stat​4,22​, Bmp4/Smad4​23,24​ and Wnt/​β-​Catenin​25,26​ pathways). In the mouse blastocyst this initial cell
fate choice is reinforced by a PrE/Epi cross-talk​8,27–31​, which progressively locks cell fates, promote their
physical segregation, and the epithelization and lining of the PrE along the blastocoel cavity​32–34​35​ while
adjusting the mutually allocated cell numbers​20,36–38​.
The resolution of a niche (E4.5) comprising two outer tissues (the polar trophoblast and the PrE)
encasing the inner Epi acts as a checkpoint for developmental progression, coincides with the blastocyst
implantation into the uterus, and leads to both a switch in Epi identity (pluripotent-formative-primed
states)​39–42​ and the morphogenesis of a rosette​43,44​. The formation of a basement membrane, mainly by the
trophoblast and PrE cells, along with differential molecular signalling (e.g. Nodal​45​ and Lif​46​) and
mechanical properties​47​ are likely to support the sustainability and polarization of the Epi with centrally
oriented apical sides. This polarization coincides with a switch of the core transcriptional network and
epigenetic state of the Epi​39–42​ marked by a loss of ​Nanog​ and a gain of ​Otx248,49
​ ​ , and with the induction,
45​
50​
expansion and fusion of lumens in part​ ​via​ beta-integrin signalling​ and exocytosis of negatively
charged sialomucins including Podocalyxin (Podxl) that repulse the apical cell membranes​43,46,51,52​. These
processes resolve the primed Epi state and the pro-amniotic cavity, which altogether set the stage for
post-implantation development.
The formation of PrE and derivatives has been studied in embryoid bodies (EBs) - aggregates of
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that reflect aspects of early embryonic development​53,54​. However, EBs are
usually cultured in conditions that do not favour a precise control over cell number and confinement, nor
the chemical nature of the medium. As a result, the PrE does not form efficiently and the culture
parameters (e.g. the use of serum-containing medium) occlude underlying mechanisms. In contrast, the
use of microsystems​55​ and chemically-defined medium​55,56​ opens possibilities to increase the control,
throughput and screening capacities, thus better understand cell fate.
Here we run combinatorial screens of proteins, GPCR ligands and small molecules in a microwell
array platform and in chemically-defined conditions. This pipeline establishes a cell culture model that
rapidly and efficiently co-form PrE- and Epi-like cells amenable to in-depth investigation. Applying this
novel model to test the functional co-development of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues​57​, we
investigate how tissues synergies support the potential for viability, expandability and morphogenesis of
the post-implantation epiblast.

We used a high-content screening platform of non-adherent hydrogel microwells in
96-well-plates​58​ to reproducibly aggregate small, defined numbers of ESCs into EBs (​Figure 1A​). The
number of ESCs seeded into microwells followed a Poisson distribution across the 430 microwells (7–12
cells per microwell), which aggregated within 24 hours (​Figure 1B, Figure S1)​. We quantified PrE
differentiation ​via​ in situ imaging of a fluorescent reporter under the promoter for Pdgfrα (ESCs
Pdgfrα-h2b-gfp/+​
, ​Figure S2​)7,59​
​ . EBs survived in serum-free B27N2 medium and leukemia inhibitory factor
(Lif) but did not proliferate and formed only a few PrE cells (Yield of Pdgfrα+ EBs: 1%, ​Figure 1C,
Figure S3​). In contrast, the addition of serum induced proliferation and the appearance of Pdgfrα+ EBs
(44%, ​Figure 1C​,​ ​p​ < 0.001, ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test). Consistent with a previous
report​18​, we observed that an initial 2D expansion in chemically-defined B27N2/2i/Lif medium​60
enhanced the permittivity for PrE formation, as compared to an initial expansion in serum-containing
medium (​Figure 1C​). Thus ​naïve​ ESCs have an enlarged ability to respond to PrE-inductive signals. We
concluded that similar to the blastocyst cells​7,59​, PrE formation in EBs requires an initial permissive state,
along with undefined signals regulating proliferation and differentiation.

A three-dimensional screen reveals signalling pathways regulating Pdgfrα expression.
Several signalling pathways influence the formation of the PrE lineage including Stat​22​, Retinoic
acid​61​, Fgf​5,20,62​, Wnt​63,64​, and Tgf​65​. In the ​conceptus​, these pathways are likely to act synergistically but
their actions and interactions​ ​remain difficult to investigate. We thus tested these developmental pathways
in cultured ESCs. While Lif (10 ng/mL) increased the yield of Pdgfrα+ EBs in serum cultures (30% yield,
3.6-fold increase, ​Figure 1D​), the addition of Retinoic acid (RA; 10 nM) further improved the process
(91% yield, 3-fold increase, ​Figure 1D​) as well as increased the number of Pdgfrα+ clusters per EB
(5.5-fold, ​Figure 1D, ​clusters are defined as Pdgfrα+ cells found within the equatorial plane of EBs, and
reflecting loci of EBs differentiation into Pdgfrα+ cells, see methods and ​Figure S2​). In contrast, the
effect of these two molecules appeared restricted in serum-free B27N2/Lif medium (16% yield). We
concluded that Lif and RA support but are not sufficient to form Pdgfrα+ cells.
We then created a small library including the known activators and inhibitors of signalling
pathways active in the blastocyst (​Table 1​). We first tested them individually in serum-containing
medium, and measured the percentage of Pdgfrα+ EBs (yield) and the number of Pdgfrα+ clusters per EB.
The broad tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Sodium Orthovanadate (40 µM) supported a 1.5-fold increase in
yield and a 1.3-fold increase in the number of cells (​Figure 1J​). Fgf4 (100 ng/mL) and the Wnt activator
CHIR99021 (6 µM) increased both the yield (44% and 81%, respectively) and the number of cells (both
1.6-folds; ​Figure 1E, 1J​). Accordingly, inhibiting Wnt secretion (IWP2), Wnt processing (XAV), and
MAPK (PD032) did not increase the yields (​Figure 1E​). We concluded that, similar to events occurring
in the blastocyst​5​, the Fgf and Wnt pathways regulate both the differentiation and the expansion of
Pdgfrα+ cells.
In contrast, the activation of the Tgfβ pathway by Nodal, Activin-A, BMP4 or Tgf-β1 reduced
either the yield or the number of Pdgfrα+ cells. Consistent with these observations, the TGF-β receptor
inhibitor SB43 and the Alk1/2 inhibitor ML347 (Bmp signalling) enhanced the formation of Pdgfrα+ cells
(​Figure 1I)​. The BMP pathway inhibitor LDN193189 prevented proliferation of ESCs (​Figure 1I​).We
concluded that the activation of the Wnt and Fgf pathways and the inhibition of the Tgfβ pathway act on
the generation of Pdgfrα+ cells.

A three-dimensional screen reveals GPCR ligands inducing Pdgfrα expression.

Next, to complement the action of the developmental pathways, we investigated the potency of
GPCR ligands and ran a compound screen of 264 GPCR ligands. DL-adrenaline, a β-adrenergic agonist
acting upstream of the cAMP/PKA pathway, strongly increased the yield of Pdgfrα+ EBs (206%) without
affecting the overall size of the EB or the number of clones (​Figure 1E​). Consistent with the role of
GPCR ligands in enhancing the activity of signalling pathways​66​, we concluded that DL-adrenaline
potentiates ESCs for Pdgfrα expression independent of proliferation. Accordingly, the cell-permeable
analogue 8Br-cAMP (3200 µM) also increased the yield of PrE EBs by 91% as compared to serum/Lif
alone, ​Figure 1E​)55​
​ without affecting the size of EBs.
Altogether, we concluded that Fgf4, Wnt, Lif, RA, DL-Adrenaline, and cAMP individually
increase the potential for ESCs to express Pdgfrα.
A combinatorial screen delineates a chemically-defined medium inducing Pdgfrα
expression.
Because signalling molecules act in concert to ensure development, we ran combinatorials of
molecules, this time in serum-free medium (B27N2 medium, ​Figure S3​). Using a factorial design
screening approach​67​, we tested combinations of 8Br-cAMP, DL-Adrenaline, Lif, Fgf4, Sodium
Orthovanadate, Chir, ML347, SB43, RA, and Activin-A at effective concentration ranges. Specific
combinations preserved EB viability (measured by EB-size), EB integrity (measured by EB circularity)
and induced PrE-like differentiation (Pdgfrα expression, ​Figure S4​). Among all 21 combinations, a
medium containing 8Br-cAMP (1 mM), RA (10 nM), Fgf4 (100 ng/mL) and Chir (5 µM) led to a stark
upregulation of the yield of Pdgfra+ EBs (78%, ​Figure 1K, L, S4C​). Consistent with the important role
of RA​61,65​, depleting this molecule from the induction medium reduced the yield significantly (​Figure
1L)​. However, the synergy with other factors was essential for a robust and efficient induction (​Figure
1L​). This chemically-defined inductive medium also reduced the number of dead cells per EB, to levels
similar to serum-containing medium (​Figure S5B​), and no longer required the presence of Lif neither for
maintaining viability or Pdgfrα expression (​Figure S5A​).

The embryoid bodies form a niche including both PrE- and Epi-like cells.
The resulting EBs spontaneously formed an outer layer of PrE-like cells positive for the
transcription factors Gata6​3,72–75​ and Sox17​76–78​ and a core of Nanog+ cells (96 h, ​Figure 2A​). This spatial
organization is consistent with the segregation of the PrE and Epi of the late blastocyst​5​. We then
characterized the cells ​via​ single-cell transcriptomics (96 h). In congruence with Pdgfrα labelling, the
cells showed two distinctive subpopulations (​Figure 2B, Table 2)​. One expressed the PrE genes ​Gata6,
Gata4, Pdgfrα, Sox7 and Sox17​, while the other one expressed the Epi genes ​Nanog,​ ​Sox2​ and O
​ ct4
(​Figure 2C​). Importantly, Epi-specific Fgf4 and PrE-specific Fgfr2 were mutually expressed, which
resembled the native circuitry reinforcing PrE identity in blastocysts​10,16,79​. SPRING Louvain clustering​68
pinpointed 3 subpopulations of extra-embryonic cells (​Figure 2D​): one displaying the early parietal
endoderm (PE) markers Follistatin and Vimentin, one opposing subpopulation displaying the early
visceral endoderm (VE) markers Dab2 and Podocalyxin, while the third subpopulation had an
intermediate profile. In accordance with the Louvain clustering, principal component (PC) analysis
separated the embryonic and extra-embryonic cells along PC1 and sub-populations of extra-embryonic

cells along PC2 (​Figure S6A, S6B​). The bottom 50 and top 50 differentially-expressed genes along the
PC axis 2 showed on one side PE genes​69​ such as ​Vim​, ​Fst,​ ​Thbd​, ​Sema6​ and N
​ og​, and VE genes​69​ such as
Amn​, ​Cubn​, ​Dab2,​ ​Podxl​ (Pcx), ​Apoe​ on the opposite side (​Figure 2E, Figure 5SB​). In line with this,
tSNE maps allowed clustering putative PE and VE subpopulations (​Figure S7A, Figure S7B) ​that
revealed distinct expression levels for known PE and VE genes (​Figure S7C​) and a number of potential
markers for these subpopulations (​Figure 2E, Figure S6B, Table2​).
From these data, we performed gene ontology term analysis (​Table 2​). In the putative VE
subpopulation, cell polarity regulators typical of an epithelium and Tgf-β pathway responses were
enriched as compared to Epi, in accordance with the epithelium nature of the VE and with the previously
proposed function of Tgf-β in VE expansion and in Epi sustainability​45​. We conclude that the chemically
defined medium induced the co-formation of spatially organized PrE-like and Epi-like cells, the former
group capable of bifurcating into both VE and PE lineages.

The PrE/Epi-like niche spontaneously progresses into extraembryonic endoderm/Epi
rosettes in growth factors-free and gel-free culture conditions.
In utero​, extraembryonic endoderm (XEn)/Epi rosettes form following implantation of the
blastocyst, when the VE deposits a laminin-rich basement membrane that polarizes the Epi cells and
triggers the formation of the pro-amniotic cavity (​Figure 3A​)80​
​ . Such Epi-only rosettes form in the
absence of PrE cells when ESCs are encapsulated in Matrigel (that mimics the basement membrane) and
cultured in serum-containing medium (that provides soluble molecules)​43,81​. We thus tested whether the
free-standing PrE/Epi niche was sufficient to functionally generate post-implantation-like rosettes. Upon
transfer into plain B27N2 medium without growth factors, the suspended PrE/Epi structures proliferated
and formed a cavity morphologically resembling the polarized XEn/Epi tissues (​Figure 3A, 3B, 3C​).
Interestingly, ESC alone do not proliferate in plain B27N2 medium. This suggested that the PrE- and
Epi-like tissues mutually supported their proliferation. Similar to post-implantation embryos, the Epi-like
cells expressed Oct4, accumulated F-actin and Pcx at the apical side to form a cavity (​Figure 3D, E​),
while the PrE-like cells produced a laminin basement membrane and polarized as well (Pcx, ​Figure 3E​).
Over time, the cavities increased in size (​Figure S8A​). The process was both efficient (94%) and
reproducible (​Figure S8B, S6C​). We concluded that the formation of the PrE/Epiblast niche was
sufficient to support the spontaneous, mutual proliferation and organization of a post-implantation-like
structure including a pro-amniotic cavity.

Lif signalling inhibits the formation of the pro-amniotic-like cavity.
Lif has been shown to prevent the formation of the amniotic cavity in Matrigel-embedded /
serum-cultured conditions​46​. ​Similarly, the presence of Lif during the first 3 or for the entire 6 days of ​in
vitro​ development respectively reduced and fully inhibited the formation of the pro-amniotic cavity, as
seen by the absence of Pcx within the Epi and non-apically located Pcx in the XEn (​Figure 3F-H​). Also,
the inhibition of apoptosis using Z-vad-fmk did not impair the hollowing of the pro-amniotic cavity
(​Figure S8B)​, as previously observed​43,81​.
Altogether, we concluded that, in chemically-defined conditions, a restricted number of signalling
pathways (Wnt, Fgf, RA, cAMP) are sufficient to induce the co-formation of PrE-like and Epi-like cells
supporting the spontaneous organization of a structure resembling the post-implantation embryonic stage.

The chemically-defined medium enhances Primitive Endoderm formation in blastoids.
Next, we tested the capacity to modulate the induction of PrE-like cells in blastoids by exposing
ESCs including a fluorescent reporter for Gata6 (ESCs​Gata6-h2b-venus/+) ​ 82​
​ to the inductive molecules. For this,
we primed the cells during the aggregation phase (0 – 24 hours, ​Figure 4A​), prior to adding the
trophoblast stem cells (TSCs)​56​. PrE-induction tempered the efficiency of blastoid formation (from 49%
to 36%, ​Figure 4B​) by reducing the efficiency of TSCs to engulf the EBs (from 39% to 30% of

non-engulfed structures, ​Figure 4B​). Nevertheless, the induction increased the overall percentage of
blastoids including Gata6+ and Nanog+ cells to 78%, compared to 22% under standard conditions
(​Figure 4D, E​). Concomitantly, the number of Gata6+ cells increased (p-value = 0.00079, ​Figure 4E, F).
Notably, the total number of inner cells was also higher upon PrE induction (​Figure 4G​). In accordance
with our observations in rosettes and with a previous study​83​, these data confirm that a synergy between
PrE and Epi cells regulates the total number of inner cells. The ratio of Gata6+/ Nanog+ cell numbers in
PrE-induced blastoids was comparable to the one in blastocysts (0.83 vs. 0.9 in 120 cells-stage blastocyst
((Saiz et al. 2016), ​Figure 4H​).
Next, we examined the spatial organization of PrE-induced blastoids. When blastocysts
progressed, the PrE cells sorted out from the Epi cells to line the blastocoel cavity. We observed that 21%

The induction of Primitive Endoderm supports the ​in vitro​ formation of
post-implantation-like structures from blastoids.
We then tested whether the PrE/Epi-like tissue within blastoids could support the development of
structures reflecting aspects of the post-implantation ​conceptus,​ such as the 3-dimensional organization of
the epiblast. We plated PrE-induced blastoids containing PrE cells (>2 Gata6+ or Pdgfrα+ cells) and
non-induced blastoids ​in vitro​86,87​ The presence of PrE cells (Gata6+) enhanced the potential to expand the
PrE (96 h, Gata6+, 53% vs. 10%, ​Figure 5A​). Similar to our previous observation​56​, PrE-induced
blastoids with Gata6+ cells and non-induced blastoids maintained survival of Epi cells (96 h, 98% vs
100%, ​Figure 5A​).
We observed that the potential for the PrE cells to expand depended on the initial number of PrE
cells present in blastoids (​Figure 5B​). In addition, the induction of PrE cells improved the formation of
3D structures (35% vs. 7%, ​Figure 5C​) containing both Epi and PrE cells. Consistent with our findings in
EBs, we concluded that PrE cells are critical for the proliferation and organization of the
post-implantation Epi. Clearly, the potential of the Epi to expand and initiate the formation of a 3D
structure depended on the initial number of PrE cells present in blastoids (​Figure 5E)​. We concluded that
PrE-induction promoted the survival of expandable Epi- and PrE-like cells. Finally, upon culture, the
PrE-induced blastoids supported the formation of rosettes including Gata6+/ Pdgfrα+ cells surrounding
Epi-like cells and including a pro-amniotic-like cavity (2 out of 14 and 1 out of 9 PrE-induced blastoids in
two separate experiments, ​Figure 5D​). In sharp contrast, the non-induced blastoids lacked that potential.
Altogether, we concluded that a specific combination of signalling pathways is sufficient to
rapidly and efficiently generate a PrE/Epi-like niche within blastoids that supports the ​in vitro​ expansion
and morphogenesis of a post-implantation-like tissues.

Discussion
High-content screening of a large number of embryoid bodies on a microwell array in
chemically-defined culture conditions allows for robust statistics necessary to delineate the effect of
signalling pathways. Here, we observed that the combination of cAMP, RA, Wnt and FGF4 signals were
sufficient to rapidly and efficiently drive the co-formation of PrE-like cells and Epi-like cells in gel-free
and serum-free cultures. Upon transfer in plain medium, these two cell types are capable of further growth
and autonomous organization into a structure resembling post-implantation embryonic and
extraembryonic tissues.
Consistent with the idea that the blastocyst is a self-regulating system​83​, the induction of PrE-like
cells in blastoids shows a synergy between PrE and Epi cells regulating the total cell number, which
sustains the expansion and morphogenetic capability during the post-implantation stage. Accordingly, the
insufficient formation of PrE and incomplete lining of the PrE epithelium between the Epi and blastocoel
has been described to halt Epi expansion in blastocysts​59,81​. Similarly, inappropriate specification of the
extraembryonic VE has been shown to result in disorganized ectoderm and stagnated development ​88​.

Overall, these results argue for the importance of the PrE tissue in nurturing the Epi for survival and
expansion, and for a synergistic development of the embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. The
mechanisms by which the PrE accomplishes this remain to be determined.
Altogether, this study establishes stem cell-based models of the embryo amenable to
high-throughput drug and genetic screens and alleviating the burden on the use of animals​57,89​. We
propose that these models are foundations for basic and biomedical discoveries to elucidate the critical
and currently unknown processes of embryogenesis.

Methods and Materials
No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size.

Microfabrication
Elastomeric stamps for imprinting the agarose microwell arrays were fabricated using PDMS Sylgard 184
kit. Microwell arrays were moulded as described previously​58​ using a 2.2% w/v solution of Ultrapure
agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific 11560166). In each well of a 96-well-plate 430 microwells, with a
diameter of 200 µm, were moulded. Each well contains a calculated liquid volume of 250 µL split
between 225 µL medium and 25 µL hydrogel buffer.

Stem cell culture
The following lines were used for experiments: Pdgfrα h2b-GFP/+, H2B-RFP V6.5 sub-clone, Gata6
H2B-Venus/+;ColA1 TetO-Gata4-mCherry/+;R26 M2rtTA/+ ES cells. Gata6 H2B-Venus cell line was a
kind gift of C. Schröters laboratory. The V6.5 cell line has a C57BL/6 ×​ ​ 129/Sv background and was
obtained from the laboratory of R. Jaenisch. The Pdgfrα H2B-GFP/+ cell line has an ICR background and
was derived from A.-K. Hadjantonakis’ laboratory. Standard ES cell expansion was done in 2i/Lif
conditions comprising B27N2 (Gibco) medium with leukaemia inhibitory factor (Lif, Merck Millipore
ESG1106, 10 ng/mL), PD0325901 (1 μM, AxonMed 1408) and CHIR99021 (3 μM, AxonMed 1386) as
developed previously (Nichols et al. 2009), supplemented with 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco
11528926).
ESCs were seeded and expanded as 25.000 per cm​2​ on 0.1% w/v gelatin-coated tissue-culture treated
polystyrene dishes (Nunc). ESCs were expanded for minimally 2 passages before aggregating into EBs
within the agarose microwells. For cell banking and serum/Lif experiments ESC were expanded on a
monolayer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEF) in DMEM containing sodium pyruvate and Glutamax
(Thermo Fisher, 10569010) supplemented with 10 mM Non-essential amino acids (Gibco, 12084947), 10
mM HEPES (Gibco, 15630056), 10 ng/mL Lif and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol
TSCs were seeded and expanded as 25.000 per cm​2​ on 3% Matrigel-coated dishes in chemically defined
TX-medium as developed previously (Kubaczka et al. 2014) or on TCPS with a Laminin-512 coating
(Biolamina LN521-02, 5 µg/mL overnight incubation at 4 degree C) in TX-medium supplemented with
Activin-A (Bio-techne 338-AC-010), 50 ng/mL IL11 (Peprotech, 220-11), 200 µM 8Br-cAMP (Biolog,
B007-50E), 25 ng/mL BMP7 (RnD systems, 5666-BP-010), 5 nM LPA (Tocris 3854), 2 ng/mL TGFβ1
(Peprotech, 100-21-B), 25 ng/mL Fgf4 (RnD systems, 5846-F4-025), 1 µg/mL heparin (Sigma), 100 µM
2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco 11528926).

EB, PrE/Epi and XEn/Epi formation
EBs were formed by seeding an average of 7 ESC per microwell in either serum medium, Lif/serum
medium or B27N2-based media, all supplemented with 50 µM of 2-mercaptoethanol. Serum medium
consists of high-glucose DMEM containing sodium pyruvate and Glutamax (Thermo Fisher, 10569010)
and supplemented with 10 mM Non-essential amino acids, 10 mM HEPES and penicillin/streptomycin.
Lif was supplemented in a standard working concentration of 10 ng/mL. PrE-induction medium consists
of advanced B27N2 medium supplemented with 3 μM CHIR99021, 50 ng/mL Fgf4, 10 nM RA, 1 mM
8Br-cAMP and 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol.To induce XEn/Epi Rosettes from PrE-induced EBs, 14 ESCs
were seeded per microwell. Medium was refreshed after 48 h of culture with advanced B27N2
supplemented with 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol. After 72 h EBs were flushed out and transferred into
6-well plates with 2 mL advanced B27N2 medium supplemented with 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol.

Blastoid formation
Blastoids were formed as described previously​56,90​. For control blastoids, an average of 7 ESC was seeded
per microwell in serum/Lif medium (10 ng/mL Lif, control blastoids) with 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol. For
PrE-induced blastoids an average of 7 ESC was seeded per microwell in either 1) B27N2 medium with
PrE-induction compounds and 10 ng/mL Lif for 21 hours incubation followed by serum/Lif for 3 hours,
or 2) Serum/Lif medium with PrE-induction compounds. After 24 hours of ESC aggregation an average
of 17 TSC were added per microwell in TX-medium with non-essential amino acids and the blastoid
culture components; 20 µM Y27632 (AxonMed 1683), 5 µM CHIR99021 (AxonMed 1386), 1 mM
8Br-cAMP, 25 nG/mL FGF4, 15 nG/mL TGFβ1, 30 nG/mL IL11, 1 µg/mL heparin, 100 µM
2-mercaptoethanol. After 24 hours an additional 1 mM of 8Br-cAMP was added to the blastoid culture
medium.

In vitro​ post-implantation assay

Blastoids cultured for 96 h (from seeding ESC) were selected on their morphology (cystic, roundness,
presence of inner cell mass) and transferred from microwells onto tissue-culture glass or polystyrene
plastic in IVC1 medium using mouth pipetting. IVC1 medium consisted of Advanced DMEM/F12
medium (Fisher Scientific, 11540446) with non-essential amino acids and sodium pyruvate, 10%
ESC-selected fetal bovine serum, 1/100 Glutamax (Fisher Scientific, 35050061), penicillin/streptomycin,
1/100 ITS-X (Fisher Scientific, 10524233), 8 nM β-estradiol (Sigma, E8875), 200 ng/mL progesterone
(Sigma, P8783), 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco 11528926). Structures were fixated after 96 hours of
culture using a fresh solution in PBS of 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde.

Image-based analysis
Fluorescence images were acquired on a widefield Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope using a 10x objective.
Analysis of EBs was performed using a custom-made pipeline in CellProfiler2.0 (Broad Institute)​91​. The
number of EBs and cells positive for Pdgfrα-h2b-gfp were determined by thresholding on intensity. EBs
were considered positive for Pdgfrα when one or more cells were positive for Pdgfrα-h2b-gfp. The

Immunofluorescence
Blastoids and blastocysts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 1X PBS for 15 minutes at room
temperature. VE/Epi rosettes and ​in vitro​ implantation cultures were fixated in 2% paraformaldehyde
solution with 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 1X PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature. After fixation, samples
were washed 3x in washing buffer (0.1% Triton-X with 2% BSA in 1​×​PBS), permeabilized in 1%
Triton-X solution in 1X PBS and blocked in blocking buffer (2% BSA, 5% serum of host 2nd antibody
species, 0.5% glycine, 0.1% Triton-X, 0.2% Tween-20) for 30 minutes. Samples were incubated in
antibody solution (¼ of blocking buffer with ½ of 1​×​PBS and ¼ of 0.1% Triton-X in 1​×​PBS) with
primary antibodies for 12 hours at 4 degree C, washed 3x 10 minutes with washing buffer followed by
incubation with secondary antibodies in antibody solution for 4 hours at 4 degree C. Optionally
complemented with DAPI (0.2 µg/mL) and phalloidin (Thermo Scientific, 1/100 dilution).
