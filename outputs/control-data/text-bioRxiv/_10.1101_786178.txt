Abstract

The function of the ventral hippocampus (vHC) supports many behaviors, including those related to
reward seeking behaviors and drug addiction. We used a mouse model of alcohol dependence and
relapse to investigate the role of the vHC in alcohol (ethanol) drinking. One experiment used a
chemogenetic approach to inhibit vHC function while ethanol dependent and non-dependent mice had
access to ethanol. Interestingly, the non-dependent mice expressing an inhibitory DREADD in the VHC
showed a significant increase in ethanol drinking (~30%) after hM4Di DREADD activation with
clozapine-n-oxide (CNO; 3 mg/kg, ip.) compared to vehicle. On the other hand, ethanol dependent
mice, which were already drinking significantly more ethanol than non-dependent mice, only had a
slight, non-significant increase in drinking after CNO challenge. In a separate group of dependent and
non-dependent mice, GCaMP6f calcium-dependent activity was recorded in the vHC while mice were
actively drinking ethanol. These data showed that once mice were rendered ethanol dependent and
were drinking more ethanol than the non-dependent mice, calcium signaling in the ventral hippocampus
decreased (~45%) in the ethanol dependent mice compared to the non-dependent mice. Together, these
findings suggest that ethanol dependence reduces activity of the ventral hippocampus and that reduced function
of this brain region contributes to increased ethanol drinking.

Introduction
The consequences of heavy alcohol drinking extract significant personal, medical and economic costs
(Rehm et al. 2014; Rehm et al. 2017). Unfortunately, neurobiological adaptations that perpetuate harmful
drinking are not fully understood and animal models remain important for the basic discovery of mechanisms
and treatments of alcohol use disorder. Mice rendered alcohol (ethanol) dependent display significant
escalations of ethanol drinking as compared to non-dependent animals (Becker 2013; Becker & Lopez 2004;
Griffin 2014; Griffin et al. 2014; Griffin et al. 2015; Griffin et al. 2009b; Lopez & Becker 2005). In these studies,
C57BL/6J (B6) mice are exposed to repeated cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure which
are interleaved with periods of voluntary drinking. Under these conditions, CIE exposed mice increase ethanol
consumption compared to air-exposed control mice (CTL). Similar findings have been reported by other
laboratories in mice (DePoy et al. 2013; Dhaher et al. 2008; Finn et al. 2007; Jeanes et al. 2011) and rats (Gilpin
et al. 2008; Hansson et al. 2008; O'Dell et al. 2004; Roberts et al. 1996). The escalated drinking observed in
ethanol dependence is likely due to adaptations in specific neurobiological systems regulating ethanol intake.
It is well known that the hippocampus plays a prominent role in mediating spatial orientation, navigation
and learning and memory. Interestingly, preclinical lesion and inactivation studies indicate that the more anterior
and dorsal areas of the hippocampus have the largest role in spatial orienting and learning behaviors, while the
posterior and ventral areas of the hippocampus, though still contributory to spatial navigation, appear to also
participate in other realms of behavior (Bannerman et al. 2004; Fanselow & Dong 2010; Kanoski & Grill 2015;
Pennartz et al. 2011; Strange et al. 2014). Nevertheless, it has been shown that increased activity of the ventral
hippocampus promotes conditioned place preference for social reward (LeGates et al. 2018) while inactivation
diminishes context-mediated drug (Bossert et al. 2016; Lasseter et al. 2010; Rogers & See 2007; Sun & Rebec
2003) and alcohol reinstatement (Marchant et al. 2016). Thus, the ventral hippocampus processes salient
contextual information.
Interestingly, some reports indicate that the vHC plays an important role in motivation and reward that
extends beyond simply processing external contextual cues. For example, studies indicate that lesion or
reversible inactivation of the vHC increases food reward (Ferbinteanu & McDonald 2001), increases feeding
behavior in novel situations (Bannerman et al. 2002a; Bannerman et al. 2002b), decreases fear and anxiety
(Kjelstrup et al. 2002; Maren & Holt 2004). Recent data also suggests a role for the ventral hippocampus in

regulating habit and goal motivated behaviors (Barker et al. 2019) as well as increases in exploration of aversive
contexts in approach-avoidance studies (Ito & Lee 2016; Schumacher et al. 2016). Collectively, these reports
indicate that reduced ventral hippocampus function can facilitate behavior, suggesting the ventral portion of the
hippocampus participates in the active inhibition of at least some behaviors (Schwarting & Busse 2017). Thus,
the role of the ventral hippocampus in motivation and reward is complex and in need of further study. Given the
broad array of behaviors influenced by the ventral hippocampus, it is reasonable to predict that the ventral
hippocampus plays an important role in regulating ethanol drinking. Studies in this report address the hypothesis
that alcohol dependence reduces ventral hippocampal function and, as a consequence, reduced ventral
hippocampal activity promotes increased ethanol consumption.

Methods
Subjects
Male C57BL/6J mice (10 weeks of age) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME),
individually housed and maintained in an AAALAC accredited animal facility under a 12 hr light cycle. Mice had
free access to food and water at all times. All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at the Medical University of South Carolina and were consistent with the guidelines of
the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Generally, Mice were given access to ethanol using limited access procedures (described below). After
establishing stable ethanol intake, mice were separated into chronic intermittent ethanol exposure (CIE; ethanol
dependent) and control (CTL; non-dependent) groups. The EtOH group received chronic intermittent exposure
to ethanol vapor in inhalation chambers (16 hr/day for four days) while CTL mice were similarly handled but
received air exposure (see below). Limited access drinking sessions were suspended during inhalation
exposure. After CIE exposure, mice entered a 72 hr abstinence period and then were tested for voluntary ethanol
intake for five consecutive days using limited access conditions as before. Cycles of CIE exposure interspersed
with Test weeks of voluntary drinking were repeated several times for both experiments.

Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane mixed with medical-grade air (4% induction, 2% maintenance),
given a subcutaneous injection of 5 mg/kg carprofen (Pfizer, Inc), and placed in a Kopf stereotaxic instrument
with digital display (Model 942). For Experiment 1, mice received bilateral infusion of either a virus containing an
inhibitory DREADD (AAV(8)-CaMKIIa-hM4Di-mCherry; Addgene, Inc.) or a control virus expressing only
mCherry (AAV(8)-CaMKIIa-mCherry; Addgene, Inc.) into the vHC [relative to bregma, AP: -3.4 mm, ML: Â±3.0
mm, DV: -4.75mm], relative to Bregma (Franklin & Paxinos 2008). For Experiment 2, mice received a unilateral
infusion of a virus to drive expression of a geneitically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f (AAV-CamKIIaGCaMP6f-WPRE;

secured in place by light-cured dental resin (Griffin et al. 2014).

Limited Access Drinking Procedures
Mice were trained to drink ethanol in the home cage as previously described (Becker & Lopez 2004;
Griffin 2014; Griffin et al. 2009a; Lopez & Becker 2005), with the exception that both experiments started with
mice drinking 15% (v/v) ethanol without the sucrose fading procedure used before. The 2-hr drinking sessions
started 3 hours into the dark phase Monday through Friday. The amount of ethanol consumed was determined
by weighing bottles before and after the access period, spillage was accounted for by measuring bottle weights
maintained on empty cages. Mouse body weights were recorded weekly. There were some differences in the
limited access procedures between Experiment 1 and 2, noted below in the sections describing them.

Chronic Intermittent Ethanol (CIE) Exposure Procedures
Chronic intermittent ethanol vapor (or air) exposure was delivered in Plexiglas inhalation chambers as
previously described (Becker & Lopez 2004; Griffin 2014; Griffin et al. 2009a; Lopez & Becker 2005). Chamber
ethanol concentrations were monitored daily and air flow was adjusted to maintain ethanol concentrations within
a range that yielded stable blood ethanol levels throughout exposure (175-225 mg/dl). Mice were placed in
inhalation chambers at 1600 hr and removed 16-hr later at 0800 hr. Before each 16-hr exposure during CIE
treatment, EtOH mice were administered ethanol (1.6 g/kg; 8% w/v) and the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor
pyrazole (1 mmol/kg) to maintain a stable level of intoxication during each cycle of ethanol vapor exposure (Griffin

et al, 2009a). CTL mice were handled similarly but received injections of saline and pyrazole. All injections for
these procedures were given intraperitoneally in a volume of 20 ml/kg body weight. These procedures were the
same for Experiments 1 and 2.

Experiment 1: Gi-DREADD Activation
During Experiment 1, mice had access to both ethanol and tap water, as an alternative fluid, and the
position of ethanol and water bottles were alternated randomly to avoid side preferences. In this study, mice
were also habituated to daily intraperitoneal (ip.) injections of normal saline (10 ml/kg) given 30 min prior to
ethanol access. Finally, during the 4th Test week, mice were challenged with Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO; Tocris,
Inc) dissolved in saline (0.9%) in a cross-over design such that all mice were tested with vehicle and one dose
of CNO (3mg/kg; ip.) to examine changes in ethanol consumption when Gi-DREADDs were activated by CNO
in the ventral hippocampus.

Experiment 2: Fiber Photometry Procedures
For the fiber photometry in Experiment 2, mice had access to only a single bottle of ethanol during the 2hr access period, as described previously (Braunscheidel et al. 2019; Rinker et al. 2018). Additionally, the fiber
photometry procedures required that mice were tethered during acquisition of GCaMP6f transients and that
lickometers (Med Associates, Inc) are used to capture bottle contact data in real time in order to time-lock
licking/consummatory behavior with GCaMP6f activity. Immediately after surgery, mice were acclimated to living
around-the-clock in lickometer cages which included ad libitum access to water from bottles connected to the
lickometer system and ad libitum food available on the floor of the cage. After several days, mice were connected
to a dummy tether each day at the beginning of the dark phase and remained tethered for approximately 6 hours.
After 1-2 weeks, ethanol was provided 3 hours into the dark phase and baseline drinking established followed
the CIE exposure procedures described above.
Photometry data were acquired using acquisition equipment based on that described by the Deisseroth
lab with modifications (Braunscheidel et al. 2019). Illumination was provided by 405 nm and 470 nm fiber
collimated LEDs (Thorlabs; 30 ÂµW per channel) connected to a four-port fluorescence mini-cube (Doric Lenses,
Inc). The combined LED output passed through a 400 Âµm optical fiber (0.48 NA) pigtailed to a rotary joint

(FRJ_1x1_PT; Doric Lenses, Inc) that was housed in a custom-built balance arm. The patchcord connected to
the implanted fiber using a pinch connector (ADAF2; Thorlabs, Inc). Emission light was focused onto a
photodetector (Newport model 2151; DC low setting) low-passed filtered at 3 Hz and sampled at 6.1 kHz by a
RZ5P photometry multiprocessor (TDT, Inc) controlled by Synapse software (TDT, Inc). Excitation light was
sinusoidally modulated at 531 Hz (405 nm) and 211 Hz (470 nm) via software control of an LED light driver
(Thorlabs). Real-time demodulated emission signals from the two channels were acquired at a frequency of
1017.253 Hz and stored offline for analysis. While the mice were drinking, the lickometer system generated TTLs
that were sent to the multiprocessor, signaling contacts at the ethanol bottle.

Photometry Data Analysis
Raw data collected from the photoreceiver were low-pass filtered and then the extracted 470 nm and 405
nm signals were normalized and analyzed using custom-written scripts in MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.), following
previously published methods (Braunscheidel et al. 2019; Rinker et al. 2018). To normalize for differing rates of
photobleaching (slope measured over single recordings sessions, mean Â± sem; 405 nm -0.056 Â± 0.001, 470 nm
-0.0042 Â± 0.0004, N=45), the 405 nm and 470 nm signals for each channel were first fitted to a polynomial versus
time. The Ca++-independent isosbestic 405 nm signal was then subtracted from the Ca++-dependent 470 nm
signal, to remove movement artifacts and calculate the final ÎF/F time series. Additionally, in these recordings,
the mean of the negative values was first subtracted from the normalized ÎF/F to establish a new baseline of
the recordings for comparing changes during ethanol consumption. A licking bout for ethanol was defined as >6
Hz licking rate lasting â¥500 ms. The calcium transients were time-locked to bouts, and the GCaMP6f data before,
during and after each bout were extracted.

Statistical Analysis
Analysis was conducted in SPSS Version 25. Dependent variables were analyzed by factorial analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures as necessary with p<0.05 as the criteria for significance. For posthoc analyses, multiple comparisons Sidakâs test as indicated.

Results
Experiment 1.
Ethanol Drinking Prior to CNO Challenge. In this study, mice underwent 3 cycles of CIE exposure prior
to challenge with CNO and these data are summarized in Figure 1A. As expected from prior work (Griffin et al.
2014; Griffin et al. 2015; Griffin et al. 2009b), the ethanol dependent (CIE) mice increased ethanol intake
significantly over time compared to the relatively stable drinking the CTL group. Further, there was no effect of
virus type (mCherry vs hM4Di) on ethanol drinking in either group. This assessment was supported by 3-way
ANOVA (2 Groups) X (2 Viruses) X (4 Time points) with Time used as a repeated measure. The 3-way interaction
was not-significant [F (3,102) >0.05] and neither was the Time X Virus interaction [F (3,102) >0.05]. However,
the Group X Time interaction was significant [F (3,102) <0.05]. Post-hoc analysis of these data show that the
CIE mice consumed more ethanol in the Test drinking weeks compared to the CTL group (*p<0.05), as well as
their own baseline (^p<0.05).
CNO Challenge and Ethanol Drinking. During Test week 4, mice were challenged with CNO in a cross
over design on Tuesday and Thursday of that week to activate the inhibitory DREADD, hM4Di, expressed in
vHC glutamatergic neurons. These data are summarized in Figure 1B and are consistent with the data in Figure
1A showing that CIE mice consume more ethanol than CTL mice. Further, the data show that CNO activation of
hM4Di DREADDs in the vHC, i.e., inhibition of vHC projections, only increased ethanol consumption in nondependent mice. Initially, these data were analyzed using a 3-way ANOVA (2 Groups) X (2 Viruses) X (2 Dose:
VEH vs CNO) where Dose was a repeated measure. The 3-way interaction was not significant [F (1,34) =1.7]
and neither was the Dose X Group interaction [F (1,34) <0.5]. However, the ANOVA revealed a significant
interaction of Virus X Dose [F (1,34) =8.8, p=0.005] indicating that the virus type interacted with CNO challenge.
Additional analyses focused separately on the two different viral groups using a 2-way ANOVA (Group
vs Dose), again using Dose as a repeated measure. For the mice expressing only mCherry in the ventral
hippocampus, there was no significant interaction [F (1,16) =0.925], nor was there a main effect of Dose [F (1,16)
=2.104]. There was, however, a main effect of Group [F (1,16) =11.916, p=0.003], consistent with the increased
ethanol consumption by the CIE mice (*p<0.05). Planned comparisons using Sidakâs Post-hoc Test supported
the ANOVA indicating significant differences in ethanol consumption between CIE and CTL mice (VEH and CNO
conditions both *p<0.05) but did not indicate any other significant differences. The slight decrease in ethanol

intake after CNO challenge in the CTL mice was not significant (p=0.09). Thus, as expected, CNO did not alter
ethanol consumption in CIE and CTL mice expressing the mCherry control virus.
Similar analyses were conducted on the ethanol consumption data from mice expressing hM4Di in the
ventral hippocampus. This analysis did not reveal a significant factor interaction [F (1,18) =0.743] but did indicate
significant main effects of Group [F (1,18) =5.996, p=0.025] and Dose [F (1,18) =7.776, p=0.012]. Planned
comparisons using Sidakâs Post-hoc Test supported the findings for group differences, but only for the
comparison between the CTL and CIE mice after VEH challenge (*p=0.041). No difference was noted between
CTL and CIE mice after CNO challenge (p=0.168). While there was a slight increase in ethanol consumption in
CIE mice after CNO challenge, this also was not statistically significant (p=0.094). Thus, these data suggest that
CNO activation of hM4Di in the vHC increased drinking in CTL mice to amounts observed in CIE mice, but did
not significantly affect alcohol intake in the CIE mice.
Water Drinking after CNO Challenge. Because water was also available during the ethanol access
session, water consumption was also tracked during this study on days when mice were challenged with CNO.
Earlier reports from our laboratory using lickometer systems indicate that water consumption is very low in this
limited access paradigm (Griffin et al. 2009b; Griffin et al. 2007). Consistent with these earlier reports, water
intake was very low in this experiment. In fact, many values were zero after taking into account the correction for
spillage (see methods), though some mice did consume some water. Because water intake was so sparse, no
statistical analyses were conducted on these data.

Experiment 2.
Ethanol Drinking. All data shown are from ethanol access periods when photometry recording occurred.
As expected, the CIE exposure procedures increased ethanol consumption in the CIE group compared to the
CTL group (Figure 2A & 2B). This was supported by a Group (CIE vs. CTL) X Phase (Baseline vs. Post-CIE)
ANOVA with Phase treated as a repeated measure. The factor interaction was significant [F (1,4) =15.076, p
=0.018] as was the main effect of Phase [F (1,4) =43.989, p=0.003]. The Group factor was not significant [F (1,4)
<2]. Post-hoc analysis indicated that the CIE mice increased drinking during the Post-CIE phase (*p=0.003).
Total bottle contacts (per mouse) followed a similar pattern as the ethanol consumption, as would be expected.
However, after a similar analysis, there were no significant interaction or main effects found [F (1,4) =1.6]. Lick

frequency at the bottle per bout were similar for CTL and CIE mice during both Phases of the study (data not
shown).
Calcium Transients. These analyses focused on bout level events. Here, bouts are defined as contacts
occurring over at least a 0.5 sec period at a minimum rate of 6 Hz followed by a 5sec pause before the next bout
begins. Along with the consumption data, these data are also summarized in Figure 2. In the CTL mice, the
normalized pre- and post-bout GCaMP6f signal was elevated prior to and following ethanol drinking bouts, and
this signal remained stable over the course of the drinking study. However, after CIE exposure, the CIE mice
showed attenuated pre- and post-bout GCaMP6f signals in the ventral hippocampus compared to the CTL mice.
The 2-way ANOVA on the pre-bout calcium transients revealed a near-significant factor interaction [F (1,4)
=6.456, p=0.064] with a significant main effect of Phase [F (1,4) =6.456, p=0.064]. The group factor was not
significant. Post-hoc analysis showed that during the Post-CIE Phase, the CIE mice had reduced pre-bout
calcium transients than the CTL mice (Figure 2C). Analysis on the post-bout calcium transients revealed similar
findings. The factor interaction was significant [F (1,4) =13.353, p=0.022] as was the main effect of Phase [F
(1,4) =89.123, p=0.001], while the Group factor was not [F (1,4) =1.362]. Post-hoc analysis showed that during
the Post-CIE Phase, the CIE mice had reduced post-bout calcium transients than the CTL mice (Figure 2D).
Shown in Figure 2E is an example recording from a 2-hr drinking period showing the normalized calcium signal
(in green) and the bottle contacts in vertical red lines. Note that the vertical red lines obscure the numerous
contacts and multiple bouts of ethanol drinking that can occur in relatively short periods of time. Finally, the
normalized calcium signal for the 15 secs before and after a bout during the Post-CIE phase are shown in Figure
2F with the dark line representing the group mean and the shaded area around the line indicating standard error
of the mean. Together, these findings indicate that after mice are rendered ethanol dependent and consume
more ethanol, there is less functional activity in the ventral hippocampus surrounding bouts of active ethanol
drinking.

Discussion
The two principle findings of these experiments are that inhibiting the ventral hippocampus increases
drinking in non-dependent (CTL) mice, elevating their drinking to levels similar to that of dependent mice, and
that ethanol dependent (CIE) mice have attenuated calcium signaling in the ventral hippocampus surrounding
drinking bouts. Together, these findings suggest that ethanol dependence reduces activity of the ventral

hippocampus and that reduced function of this brain region contributes to the increased drinking phenotype in
ethanol dependent mice.
Chemogenetic inhibition of ventral hippocampal activity increased ethanol drinking but, interestingly, this
was significant only for the non-dependent mice (CTL group). This suggests that the ventral hippocampus
contributes an inhibitory influence on ethanol consumption that is disrupted by ethanol dependence thus
facilitating higher ethanol consumption. This is similar to evidence for infralimbic projections to the NAc exerting
control over excessive drinking in ethanol dependent rats (Pfarr et al. 2015). Prior literature indicates that the
hippocampus is part of a behavioral inhibition circuit in the brain that serves to keep certain behaviors in check
(McNaughton 2006; Schwarting & Busse 2017). Recent work has explored this concept by modeling approachavoidance behaviors in rodents. In these studies, data indicate that inhibition of ventral hippocampal circuitry
increases approach behaviors to contexts that were previously avoided (Ito & Lee 2016; Schumacher et al.
2016). Relevant to the present study are earlier data indicating an inhibitory role of the hippocampus on
consummatory behavior (Bannerman et al. 2002a). Thus, the findings in this report extend earlier work to include
excessive ethanol drinking.
The outcome of the first experiment suggested that reduced function of the ventral hippocampus drives
ethanol drinking to higher levels, resembling the phenotype of ethanol dependent mice. To confirm that CIE
exposure reduces functional activity in the vHC, we measured calcium transients in neurons with the calcium
sensor GCaMP6f expressed the under the control of the CaMKIIa promoter using fiber photometry techniques.
Importantly, blunted GCaMP6f signals in the vHC of ethanol dependent mice occurred during a phase of the
experiment when they consumed significantly more ethanol than the non-dependent mice. Of course, the blunted
GCaMP6f signal in the ventral hippocampus of dependent mice drinking more ethanol is consistent with the
chemogenetic experiment showing that inhibition of the vHC increased ethanol drinking in non-dependent mice.
Despite the already reduced activity in the ventral hippocampus of CIE mice shown in the photometry
fiber recordings, chemogenetic inhibition of ventral hippocampal activity only produced a small, non-significant
additional increase in ethanol drinking in this group. It is possible that the lack of a further increase in drinking by
the CIE mice can be attributed to a ceiling effect either caused by the time constraints of the limited access
procedure or simply reaching a physiological limit for consumption. However, if the time available for ethanol
access is extended, we have found that B6 mice are capable of drinking 6-7 g/kg of 20% ethanol in a 4-hour

period (Haun, Lopez, Griffin and Becker, unpublished) indicating that B6 are physiologically capable of drinking
more ethanol. In addition, other recent work indicates that B6 mice can consume ~4.5 g/kg within 2 hours after
systemic challenge with the kappa receptor agonist U50488 while drinking 20% ethanol (Haun, Lopez, Griffin
and Becker, unpublished). Together, these findings suggest the likely possibility that the 2-hour access period
used in these studies may be a constraint on drinking when ethanol dependent mice are drinking 15% ethanol.
Alternatively, if providing a longer ethanol access period in combination with chemogenetic inhibition of the vHC
in ethanol dependent mice does not further increase consumption, this could suggest a limit on the reduction in
vHC activity that will influence drinking. Thus, additional experiments will be required to determine if
chemogenetic inhibition of the ventral hippocampus in ethanol dependent mice can increase drinking even
further.
In the first experiment, we also measured water intake and found that very little occurs in this limited
access drinking procedure, consistent with earlier reports (Griffin et al. 2009b; Griffin et al. 2007). Despite this
limitation, we did not find systematic evidence that chemogenetic inhibition changed consumption of the alternate
fluid choice in these mice. Still, it is premature to suggest that the effect of ventral hippocampus inhibition is
specific to ethanol. It will be important to investigate the role of the ventral hippocampus in consumption of other
reinforcers, especially natural reinforcers like food and sucrose. Some reports indicate the involvement of the
ventral hippocampus in models of feeding behavior using high concentrations of sucrose. Data from these
experiments show that inhibition of ventral hippocampus function after concluding a meal increases feeding at
the next meal (Hannapel et al. 2019; Hannapel et al. 2017), a finding broadly consistent with the data presented
in this report. Thus, more work needs to be done to determine the role of the ventral hippocampus on
consummatory behavior.
Human imaging studies indicate that compared to healthy controls there is hippocampal atrophy in
patients with alcohol use disorder (Agartz et al. 1999; Beresford et al. 2006; Nagel et al. 2005). While human
imaging studies do not differentiate dorsal and ventral areas of the hippocampus, preclinical work in the 1980âs
suggests that the ventral portion of the hippocampus may be more susceptible to ethanol-related plasticity,
exhibiting larger reductions in spine density (Lescaudron & Verna 1985). Interestingly, more recent work supports
the idea that the vHC may be more vulnerable to ethanol exposure with reports demonstrating increased
excitability which was associated with reduced expression of key proteins that regulate synaptic transmission in

the vHC (Almonte et al. 2017; Ewin et al. 2019). Although this appears opposite to the data presented here,
given the complex interactions between the hippocampal subregions in the ventral hippocampus (CA1, CA2,
CA3 and Subiculum), sorting out the multifaceted effects of ethanol on neuronal function in this area and
ultimately determining how these alterations influence behavior will be an important undertaking.
In conclusion, reduced function of the ventral hippocampus appears to be permissive in the context of
ethanol drinking, leading to increased ethanol consumption. This was measured directly using fiber photometry
procedures and also supported by using chemogenetic techniques to inhibit function of this brain region. The
work presented here reveals a complexity in hippocampal function with regards to ethanol drinking behavior that
requires further study to understand. Much of the work supporting a role for the hippocampus in various behaviors
relies on permanent or reversible lesions, however more recent work using newer, more selective technology is
emerging that is helping to resolve unanswered questions and, at the same time, reveal the complex function of
this heterogenous structure (Barker et al. 2019; Britt et al. 2012; Ewin et al. 2019; Scudder et al. 2018; Yu et al.
2017). Despite the exciting directions that research in this area is going, many questions regarding ventral
hippocampal functional remain unresolved. One important consideration for future efforts is to examine the role
of ventral hippocampal connectivity to other limbic areas such as the nucleus accumbens, which is known to be
crucial for processing reward-related information. Recent work has identified that this pathway and its
engagement of a feed-forward inhibitory circuit within the nucleus accumbens as important to a variety of
behaviors (Scudder et al. 2018; Yu et al. 2017). The role of the vHC to accumbens pathway in ethanol drinking
behavior is relatively unexplored but was recently shown to be influenced by ethanol dependence in the same
mouse model used in the present studies (Kircher et al. 2019). Thus, future work will focus on the ventral
hippocampal to accumbens pathway and the role it plays in driving excessive drinking in ethanol dependence.

Figure 1. Inhibiting ventral hippocampal function increases drinking in non-dependent (CTL) mice but not in
ethanol dependent (CIE) mice. A) Ethanol Drinking Prior to CNO Challenge (n=18-20/group). Over time, CIE
mice increased ethanol consumption (*p<0.05 within time point, ^p<0.05 versus baseline, regardless of viral
construct). B) CNO Challenge and Ethanol Drinking (n=8-11/group). CNO had no effects in mice expressing
only mCherry (see Results for more details). However, in mice expressing hM4Di in the ventral hippocampus,
CNO (3 mg/kg ip.) significantly increased drinking in the CTL mice (#p<0.05 within group for hM4Di virus) without
altering the already elevated drinking in the CIE mice. These data suggest that reduced ventral hippocampal
function contributes to increased ethanol consumption in ethanol dependence mice. All data are weekly means
