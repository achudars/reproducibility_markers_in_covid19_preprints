Abstract
Genetic variation in the enzymes that catalyse post-translational modification of
proteins is a potentially important source of phenotypic variation during
evolution. Ubiquitination is one such modification that affects turnover of
virtually all of the proteins in the cell in addition to roles in signalling and
epigenetic regulation. UBE2D3 is a promiscuous E2 enzyme that acts as a
ubiquitin donor for E3 ligases that catalyse ubiquitination of developmentally
important proteins. We have used protein sequence comparison of UBE2D3
orthologues to identify a position in the C-terminal a-helical region of UBE2D3
that is occupied by a conserved serine in amniotes and by alanine in anamniote
vertebrate and invertebrate lineages. Acquisition of the serine (S138) in the
common ancestor to modern amniotes created a phosphorylation site for Aurora
B. Phosphorylation of S138 disrupts the structure of UBE2D3 and reduces the
level of the protein in mouse ES cells (ESCs). Substitution of S138 with the
anamniote alanine (S138A) increases the level of UBE2D3 in ESCs as well as
being a gain of function early embryonic lethal in mice. When mutant S138A
ESCs were differentiated into extra-embryonic primitive endoderm (PrE), levels
of the PDGFRa and FGFR1 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were reduced and
PreE differentiation was compromised. Proximity ligation analysis showed
increased interaction between UBE2D3 and the E3 ligase CBL and between CBL
and the RTKs. Our results identify a sequence change that altered the
ubiquitination landscape at the base of the amniote lineage with potential effects
on amniote biology and evolution.

INTRODUCTION
Ubiquitination is an ancient post-translational modification that
originated in Archaea (Grau-Bove et al., 2015) and controls a wide range of
cellular and developmental processes across eukaryotic lineages (reviewed by
(Rape, 2018). One of the major functions of ubiquitination is protein quality
control and regulation of the rate of turnover of individual proteins. This occurs
through the addition of polyubiquitin chains, which act as signals that direct
proteins to the proteasome for degradation. In addition to these functions,
ubiquitination is involved in diverse processes that include epigenetic regulation
of transcription, control of lysosomal trafficking of growth factor receptors,
regulation of DNA repair and modulation of signalling pathways including,
among others, the MEK/ERK NF-kB and Wnt signalling pathways. These
different types of regulation can occur through a variety of ubiquitination events
including monoubiquitination of specific residues and addition of polyubiquitin
chains with different topologies generated by varying combinations of ubiquitin
chain linkages (Rape, 2018).
Ubiquitin is first activated by formation of a thioester bond with the E1
enzyme, and is then transferred to an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. The E2
enzyme acts as the donor for transfer to the substrate, a reaction that is
catalysed by the action of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is the component of the
cascade that confers most of the substrate specificity. Mammals have 1 to 2 E1
enzymes, around 30 E2 enzymes and at least 600 E3 ligases. This means that
each E2 generally interacts with multiple E3 enzymes. Together with the fact
that different E2s preferentially give rise to ubiquitin chains with different
linkages (Ye and Rape, 2009), this gives E2 enzymes a broad potential for
influencing cellular functions that has still to be explored in depth.
UBE2D3 is a promiscuous E2 enzyme that acts as the donor for a number
of E3 ligases that are involved in protein quality control and important signalling
and regulatory pathways (Brzovic and Klevit, 2006; Jensen et al., 1995; Wenzel
et al., 2011). The UBE2D family members are the vertebrate orthologues of the
Drosophila Effete (Eff) protein (also known as UBCD1), which shares 94%
identity with human UBE2D3 and has been shown to have multiple roles in
Drosophila development (Chen et al., 2009; Cipressa and Cenci, 2013).

Among the E3 ligases that use UBE2D3 as a ubiquitin donor in vertebrates
is the developmentally important CBL proto-oncogene (Liyasova et al., 2019),
which is responsible for controlling the endocytosis and lysosomal trafficking of
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Fortian et al., 2015) and
ubiquitination and degradation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a
(PDGFRa) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) (Haugsten et al., 2008;
Vantler et al., 2006). Other E3 ligases for which UBE2D enzymes have been
shown to act as ubiquitin donors in vertebrates include the Polycomb protein
Ring1B (Bentley et al., 2011), which catalyses mono-ubiquitination of histone
H2AK119, MDM2, which ubiquitinates the tumour suppressor and checkpoint
protein p53 and regulates its turnover (Saville et al., 2004), and CHIP/STUB1,
which plays an essential role in protein turnover and quality control (VanPelt
and Page, 2017).
Acquisition of the capacity to live entirely on land was a key event in
vertebrate evolution that took place during the Carboniferous period. The
transition occurred when tetrapod amphibia that had evolved in the Devonian
acquired the ability to breed on dry land without returning to water, leading to
evolution of the amniote lineage (reviewed by (Clack, 2012). One of the major
changes that led to this capability was the development of extraembryonic
membranes, which surrounded the amniote embryo, protecting it from
dessication (Ferner and Mess, 2011; Stern and Downs, 2012). The first true
amniote fossil has been dated to 314 Mya (Carroll, 1964) and the common
ancestor to amniotes is thought to have lived between 340 and 314 Mya (Clack,
2012). Other changes that made a terrestrial existence possible included skeletal
alterations that allowed movement and feeding on land (Clack, 2012) and the
physiological changes that made it possible for amniotes to become fully air
breathing. The detailed molecular mechanisms that led to these changes are still
poorly understood but they are likely to have included a mixture of changes to
transcription factor mediated control of developmental genes and to the
signalling pathways that control development and organogenesis.
Here we describe an unusual mutation that occurred in the common
ancestor to modern amniotes generating a single amino acid change at a highly
conserved site in the UBE2D3 gene. The substituted serine (S138) is completely

invariant across amniote lineages whereas the position is occupied by a
conserved alanine in anamniote vertebrates, invertebrates and single-celled
eukaryotes. We show that phosphorylation of S138 by Aurora B kinase disrupts
the structure of UBE2D3, destabilising it and reducing its level and activity. The
reduction in UBE2D3 activity affects the functioning of the CBL E3 ligase,
increasing the expression of RTKs in differentiating extra-embryonic primitive
endoderm (PrE). Mutation of the S138 residue to the anamniote alanine has a
gain of function effect that results in early embryonic lethality in mouse
embryos, compromised ability of mutant ESCs to develop into PrE and reduced
levels of PDGFRa and FGFR1 in differentiating PrE. Our results identify a novel
regulatory pathway that originated in the common ancestor to modern amniotes
and affected the ubiquitination landscape with potential impacts on amniote
evolution.
RESULTS
Comparison of UBE2D3 orthologues across eukaryotic lineages
The amino acid sequence conservation of UBE2D3 orthologues was
analysed by carrying out a sequence comparison across 118 eukaryotic species
using the human sequence as a reference (Figure 1 and Table S1) (see Methods
for details). The results show a very high level of conservation, with 94%
sequence identity between humans and Drosophila melanogaster and >80%
identity observed between humans and basal eukaryotes such as the Oleaginous
diatom, Fistuilifera solaris, and the extremophilic red alga, Galdieria sulphuria
(Figure 1 and Table S1). As expected, the overall variation relative to human
UBE2D3 increases with increasing evolutionary distance but the variation is
non-random and confined to specific residues or short regions while significant
stretches of the protein are completely invariant. Many of the substitutions
observed are conservative and, even where the substitution is non-conservative
the variation is generally restricted to a few amino acids. This suggests that the
variable regions have also been subject to significant functional constraint
during evolution.
The highest variability in the UBE2D3 sequence is observed in a stretch of
20 residues (127-147) that contains an a-helix at the C-terminal end of the

protein (Figure 1, Figure S1 and Table S1). The variation within the C-terminal
region is also non-random. For example, basal fish lineages (Lamprey, Elephant
shark, Spotted gar) show 90% homology between this region and the equivalent
region of human UBE2D3, whereas in a subgroup of teleost fish, the
Acanthomorpha, the homology ranges from 55-75%, and is lower than the
homology between humans and the majority of invertebrate metazoan species
examined (Figure 1 and Table S1, grey shading). The Acanthomorpha (spiny
rayed fishes) are a successful and morphologically diverse fish taxon that first
appeared approximately 120 Mya and comprise around one third of all living
vertebrates (Bellwood et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2014; Friedman, 2010). They
include the pufferfish, cichlids, sticklebacks and seahorse as well as cod and sea
bass. Several of the Acanthomorph species examined had gene duplications that
are likely to be a product of the whole genome duplication that occurred in the
common ancestor to teleosts (Meyer and Van de Peer, 2005; Opazo et al., 2013).
Neo-functionalisation or sub-functionalisation of these duplicated genes could
have contributed to the increased variation in the C-terminal region of
Acanthomorphs. It is notable that the side-chains of the hypervariable amino
acids are mainly located on the outward facing surface of the a4-helix whereas
the invariant residues mostly face inwards towards the hydrophobic core of the
protein (Figure S1B). This suggests that the variable residues are involved in
protein-protein contacts and that these contacts have been subject to
evolutionary change in the Acanthamorpha. Additional discussion of the results
obtained from the analysis of fish sequences can be found in Supplementary
Information.
Evidence of an alanine to serine substitution at UBE2D3 position 138 in the
common ancestor to amniotes
A further striking feature of the C-terminal region of UBE2D3 that was
revealed by the sequence comparison was the very high conservation of the
alanine residue at position 138 (A138) in anamniotes, invertebrates and single
celled eukaryotes (Figure 1, Table S1). The residue occupying position 138 is
located in the centre of the C-terminal a4-helix (Figure S1) and the conservation
of alanine at this position is maintained even in the Acanthamorph fish, where

the residues on both sides of position 138 are highly variable. However, in all
amniote species examined, this position is occupied by serine (S138), a residue
that is not found at position 138 in any of the other eukaryotic species examined.
This leads to the conclusion that an alanine to serine substitution occurred in the
common ancestor to modern amniotes and that the S138 residue has been
conserved in all amniote lineages. The sequence context around position 138 in
amniotes means that the substitution created a consensus phosphorylation site
for the Aurora B kinase and we have previously reported that UBE2D3-S138 is
phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by Aurora B (Frangini et al., 2013).
The variation observed in teleosts in general and the Acanthomorpha in
particular, contrasts with the near-absolute conservation of the entire UBE2D3
sequence across Amniote orders (Figure 1). This level of conservation of the
amino acid sequence of UBE2D3 has occurred despite the fact that the common
ancestors to modern amniotes and teleosts existed at roughly the same time
during the Carboniferous period and suggests that the UBE2D3 sequence is
subject to a high level of functional constraint in amniotes.
In summary, our comparative analysis of the UBE2D3 sequences leads us
to conclude that a unique alanine to serine substitution in the C-terminal region
of UBE2D3 occurred in the common ancestor to modern amniotes, creating a
consensus phosphorylation site for the Aurora B cell cycle kinase. The
occurrence of the substitution at a critical point in vertebrate evolution and its
absolute conservation in amniotes raised the possibility that the acquisition of
the serine residue at this position played a functional role in amniote evolution.
Mutation of S138 to the anamniote alanine increases the stability of
UBE2D3 in ESCs
Analysis of the mRNA levels of UBE2D family members in pluripotent
mouse ESCs showed that UBE2D3 is the predominantly expressed UBE2D
enzyme in these cells with UBE2D2 and UBE2D1 showing barely detectable
levels of mRNA (Figure S2A). This allowed us to investigate the functional roles
of the UBE2D3-S138 residue in the embryonic cell lineages of a model amniote
by replacing it with the anamniote alanine residue in mouse ESCs using
CRISPR/Cas9. Following transfection of ESCs with the guide RNA (gRNA), Cas9

expression construct and targeting sequence (see Methods), clones were isolated
and genotyped by nested PCR. Out of a total of 37 clones analysed, 10 were
homozygous for the mutation. The mutant cells grew normally and showed no
overt changes in cell cycle profile (Figure S2B). To ensure that any differences in
the behaviour of the cells were caused by the mutation, CRISPR/Cas9
mutagenesis was used to generate a revertant cell line from one mutant clone.
For subsequent functional analysis of the ESCs, wild-type ESCs were compared
with the S138A mutant clone and the A138S revertant that was generated from
it.
When the mutant UBE2D3 protein was analysed by western blotting of
protein extracts from the UBE2D3-S138A ESCs, it became apparent that the
presence of the S138A mutation enhanced the stability of the protein (Figure
2A). The mean level of UBE2D3 was increased by approximately 3-fold (P<0.05,
n=5). Analysis of UBE2D3 mRNA levels showed no significant change in the
transcript levels in the mutant and revertant cells compared with wild-type cells
(Figure S2C). Inhibition of protein synthesis by incubation of wild-type and
mutant cells with cycloheximide showed a significantly lower rate of degradation
of UBE2D3-S138A compared with wild-type UBE2D3 after 5 hours of
cycloheximide treatment, confirming the increased stability of the mutant
protein (Figure 2B). Our findings provide evidence that the alanine to serine
substitution at position 138 substantially affected the stability of UBE2D3,
thereby altering the functioning of the protein in amniotes.
Phosphorylation of UBE2D3-S138 by Aurora B destabilises the protein in
ESCs
Phosphorylation of UBE2D3-S138 (Frangini et al., 2013) has the potential to
affect the stability of the protein by introducing a negative charge in the centre of
the a4-helix of the protein. The presence of phosphorylated UBE2D3 in ESCs was
demonstrated using an antibody that specifically recognises the phosphorylated
UBE2D3-S138 residue (Frangini et al., 2013) (anti-UBE2D3-Ph; Figure S2D).
Western blotting of protein extracts from wild-type and UBE2D3-S138A mutant
ESCs using the anti-UBE2D3-Ph antibody gave a strong band in wild-type ESCs
and only a low background band in the S138A mutant cells (Figure 2C, top

panel). The background is likely to result from cross-reaction of the antiUBE2D3-Ph antibody with the unphosphorylated protein that we have observed
in vitro. Incubation of ESCs for 3 and 18 hours with the specific Aurora B
inhibitor AZD1152 reduced the level of phosphorylated UBE2D3 to background
levels (Figure 2C, bottom panel;), confirming the involvement of Aurora B in
phosphorylating S138. These results show that Aurora B has a major role in
phosphorylating wild-type UBE2D3-S138 in ESCs, although we cannot
completely exclude the possibility that S138 is also a target for phosphorylation
by other kinases.
To directly test whether phosphorylation of UBE2D3-S138 destabilises
UBE2D3, wild-type and UBE2D3-S138A mutant ESCs were incubated for 3 hours
with the specific Aurora B inhibitor AZD1152. The short incubation period was
used to avoid any possibility of interference with the cell cycle. Western blot
analysis showed that inhibition of Aurora B led to a significant increase in the
level of UBE2D3 protein compared to cells treated with vehicle (Figure 2D). In
contrast, no change was observed in the level of the UBE2D3-S138A mutant
protein, where the Aurora B phosphorylation site is not present. As a further test
of the effect of phosphorylation of S138, phosphomimetic mutant UBE2D3
proteins that had glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues at position 138 were
transiently expressed in wild-type ESCs. The results show that the
phosphomimetic mutants are very unstable in ESCs (Figure 2E), providing
further confirmation of the destabilizing effect of phosphorylation of S138.
UBE2D3-S138 phosphorylation alters the structure of the protein causing it
to become insoluble and aggregate
To further investigate the effect of phosphorylation on UBE2D3, the wildtype, S138A and phosphomimetic S138E and S138D proteins were expressed in
bacteria with the aim of purifying the proteins for structural analysis (see
Methods). A western blot of the soluble fractions and the pelleted inclusion body
fractions obtained after IPTG induction of expression followed by lysis of the
bacteria is shown in Figure 3A. The bulk of the wild-type and S138A mutant
UBE2D3 proteins was located in the soluble fractions whereas the
phosphomimetic mutant proteins were almost entirely localised to the insoluble

inclusion bodies, providing direct evidence that the presence of a negatively
charged residue at position 138 disrupts the structure of UBE2D3. This
observation also indicates that the C-terminal a–helix has an important role in
regulating the stability and level of the protein.
Efforts to purify soluble UBE2D3-S138E or S138D proteins by varying the
bacterial growth conditions were unsuccessful, precluding direct functional
analysis of the phosphomimetic mutant proteins. Therefore, as an alternative
strategy, purified wild-type and UBE2D3-S138A proteins were incubated with
Aurora B kinase and ATP. This was followed by centrifugation of the reaction mix
and analysis of the supernatant and pelleted fractions by western blotting and
probing with the anti-UBE2D3-S138Ph antibody. The results show clearly that
the phosphorylated form of wild-type UBE2D3 is located almost entirely in the
pelleted fraction (Figure 3B). No phosphorylation signal above background was
observed in the pelleted or supernatant fractions for the UBE2D3-S138A mutant
protein. Together with the observation that the phosphomimetic mutant
proteins are insoluble when expressed in bacteria, these results provide strong
evidence that phosphorylation of UBE2D3-S138 disrupts the structure of the
protein, causing it to aggregate and become insoluble.
The effect of S138 phosphorylation on the molecular structure of UBE2D3
was also addressed by carrying out molecular dynamic simulations on the
protein in the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states (Figure 3C-E; see
Methods). The results show that phosphorylation substantially alters the
structure of the protein. Two independent simulations each of duration 200 ns
were performed for the wildtype and phosphorylated protein. While both
proteins remained stable in terms of secondary structure on the timescale of the
simulations, distinct differences in their conformational behavior were observed.
The unphosphorylated protein displayed much less flexibility compared to the
phosphorylated protein. This is clearly evident from the root mean square
fluctuation (RMSF) which measures the deviations from the average structure
calculated over the simulation (Figure 3C). In particular residues 43-55, 70-80
and 130-138 show a marked increase in flexibility in the phosphorylated
compared to the unphosphorylated protein.

Visual inspection of the trajectories (Figure 3D) revealed that upon
phosphorylation, a distinct conformational rearrangement is observed in the
phosphorylated protein, namely that the a4-helix, which contains the
phosphorylated S138 moves away from the loop carrying Pro44 and Tyr 45,
thereby exposing the hydrophobic core of the protein. This was further
confirmed by calculating the distances between residues P44 and S138 and
between Y45 and Y134, which were found to increase in the phosphorylated
protein (Figure 3E). These results suggest that upon extension of the
simulations, the phosphorylated protein is likely to begin to unfold. This
rearrangement was not observed in the unphosphorylated protein, in which the
a4-helix and the aforementioned loop remain in close proximity throughout the
simulations.
The UBE2D3-S138A mutation is an early embryonic lethal in mice
The evidence that phosphorylation downregulates the level of UBE2D3 in
ESCs by disrupting the structure of the protein led us to consider the possibility
that S138 phosphorylation could have acquired functional roles in
embryogenesis during amniote evolution. To investigate the possible
involvement of UBE2D3-S138 phosphorylation in amniote embryogenesis, we
used the mouse embryo as a model system. The CRISPR/Cas9 targeting strategy
described above was used to mutate S138 to the anamniote alanine in fertilized
mouse eggs (see Methods). Initially, the eggs were implanted into foster
mothers and allowed to develop to term. However, this did not yield any live
mice that carried the mutation, which suggested that the S138A mutation is an
embryonic lethal in mice. To determine whether this is the case, embryos
generated by injection of fertilized eggs were dissected at 12.5 days after
injection and re-implantation of the eggs (E12.5) and 5 tissues were dissected
from each embryo and analysed by PCR to genotype the embryos and assess
mosaicism (see Methods). The percentage of embryos carrying the S138A
mutation at E12.5 was compared with the rate obtained by injection of a
targeting sequence that was designed to generate a synonymous mutation
(S138S) that altered the codon sequence, leaving the protein sequence
unchanged (see Methods). Injection of the control S138S targeting sequence

gave a mutation rate of 22% (10/45). In contrast, when the S138A targeting
sequence was injected, 2% of E12.5 embryos (3/137) were positive for the
mutation (Figure 4A). One of the 3 positive embryos obtained for the S138A
mutation was dead and sequencing of the 2 live embryos showed evidence of
additional mutations around the splice site upstream from the mutated codon
138 that could have compensated for the S138A mutation by downregulating
expression of the UBE2D3 gene (data not shown). As CRISPR/Cas9 targeting is
known to occasionally introduce unwanted mutations close to the targeting site,
the observation that a small proportion of embryos were able escape from the
effects of a gain of function mutation due to acquisition of additional
compensating mutations was not unexpected. The 10-fold reduction in the
proportion of E12.5 embryos carrying the S138A mutation compared with the
targeting efficiency for S138S provides clear evidence that the S138A mutation
has a high penetrance embryonic lethal effect in mice that affects the viability of
the early embryo.
To further investigate the timing of the lethal effect, embryos were
dissected 6.5 days after injection of the S138A targeting construct (E6.5 and
E7.5) and analysed by microscopy. This was followed by PCR analysis to
determine genotype (see Methods for details). Seven homozygous embryos were
identified at E6.5 and confirmed by sequencing (Figure S3). A significant
reduction in size was observed in the homozygous mutant S138A embryos
compared with the wild-type embryos (p < 0.001) (Figure 4B, C). Embryos were
also stained with anti-GATA6 and anti-OCT4 antibodies to assess visceral
endoderm (VE) and epiblast development. Staining of the homozygous mutant
E6.5 embryos gave no staining for GATA6 (VE) and very weak staining for OCT4
(epiblast) compared to wild-type cells (Figure 4D, E) The close up view of the
peripheral region of the embryo shown in Figure 4E reveals the absence of the
GATA6 staining that is indicative of VE cells at this stage of development. These
results suggest that the presence of alanine at position 138 of UBE2D3 interferes
with epiblast expansion and differentiation of VE in mouse embryos between
E4.5 and E6.5.
In summary, the CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in mice shows that mutation
of UBE2D3-S138 to the alanine that is conserved in non-amniote eukaryotes is a

high penetrance early embryonic lethal mutation in mice with death most likely
caused by a failure of lineage commitment and cellular expansion between E4.5
and E7.5. These results support the idea that phosphorylation of UBE2D3-S138
acquired important functional roles in embryogenesis during amniote evolution.
Phosphorylation of UBE2D3-S138A affects differentiation of embryonic
primitive endoderm cells
The CBL E3 ubiquitin ligase plays an important role in regulating receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) turnover by monoubiquitinating phosphorylated RTKs
and promoting trafficking of the receptors to the lysosome for degradation. RTKs
that are known targets for CBL include PDGFRa, EGFR and FGFR, all of which
have essential roles in embryonic development. In particular, FGFR1 and
PDGFRa are involved in differentiation and survival of primitive endoderm
(PrE), which is a precursor of extraembryonic lineages. (Bessonnard et al., 2019;
Molotkov et al., 2017) CBL has been shown to use UBE2D3 as a ubiquitin donor
(Fortian et al., 2015; Liyasova et al., 2019), leading us to speculate that
phosphorylation of UBE2D3-S138 mutant might be affecting the level of RTKs in
embryonic cells by regulating the activity of CBL.
To test this possibility we induced wild-type and mutant ESCs to
differentiate into XEN cells, which are an in vitro model for primitive endoderm
(PrE), by incubating them with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and activin (Niakan
et al., 2013; Tomaz et al., 2017). PrE differentiates from the inner cell mass (ICM)
of the developing blastocyst in response to signalling through the FGFR and
PDGFRa RTKs (Bessonnard et al., 2019; Molotkov et al., 2017). The cells of the
PrE lineage give rise to the parietal endoderm, which forms the inner surface of
the yolk sac. PrE cells are also precursors of visceral endoderm, which has
important inductive roles during gastrulation. After 8 days of induction, wildtype and revertant ES cells gave rise to large numbers of cells with the
characteristic XEN cell morphology (Niakan et al., 2013; Tomaz et al., 2017),
whereas the mutant cells failed to differentiate efficiently and gave significantly
reduced numbers of XEN cells. (Figure 5A). The reduced efficiency of
differentiation was confirmed by a time-lapse analysis from days 4 to 8 of the
differentiation, which showed greatly reduced rates of XEN cell colony formation

during differentiation of the S138A mutant cells compared with the wild-type
cells. (Supplementary Video 1). FACS analysis of PDGFRa and
immunofluorescent staining for PDGFRa and FGFR1 showed strong reductions
in the levels of both RTKs in the mutant cells after 8 days of differentiation,
confirming the impact of the UBE2D3-S138A mutation on PrE differentiation.
(Figure 5B and 5C).
Interactions between CBL and its receptor tyrosine kinase substrates are
enhanced by the UBE2D3-S138A mutation
The proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to measure the interaction
between CBL and UBE2D3 during differentiation of ESCs into XEN (primitive
endoderm) cells (Figure 6A – D). PLA detects and amplifies interactions between
oligonucleotide tags on the two antibodies, generating interaction foci that can
be visualised by microscopy. When PLA was used to compare the level of
interaction between UBE2D3 and CBL in wild-type, S138A and revertant A138S
ESCs after 3 days of differentiation, a substantial increase in the number of
interaction foci was observed in the S138A mutant cells compared with wildtype cells, whereas the A138S revertant cells showed a similar level of
interaction to the wild-type cells (Figure 6B). These results provide evidence
that phosphorylation of UBE2D3-S138 downregulates CBL activity during PrE
differentiation and that this regulation is blocked by the S138A mutation.
PLA was also used to analyse the interaction between CBL and the RTK
PDGFRa after 3 days of XEN cell differentiation. The results showed an increase
in the number of interaction foci in S138A mutant cells compared with wildtypes cells (Figure 6C). A similar increase was also observed in the interactions
between CBL and FGFR1 (Figure 6D). The increased interactions provide an
explanation for the reduction in the levels of PDGFRa and FGFR1 observed by
immunofluorescence staining in differentiating PrE cells.
The effect of the S138A mutation on the ability of ESCs to differentiate
into the three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, was also tested
(See Methods). Differentiation into the germ layers showed that wild-type and
mutant ESCs gave rise to all three cell types with similar efficiency (Figure S4).
These results show that the effect of Aurora B downregulation of UBE2D3 levels

and CBL activity is strongest on differentiation of extraembryonic PrE, although
we cannot rule out more subtle effects of the mutation on differentiation of the
germ layers that would contribute to the lethal effect of the UBE2D3-S138A
mutation in mouse embryos.
UBE2D3 acts a ubiquitin donor for a number of E3s in addition to CBL and
is involved in the ubiquitination of a wide range of substrates. Cyclin D1 is a
known target of UBE2D3-mediated ubiquitination, which leads to its
downregulation (Hattori et al., 2007; Mittal et al., 2011). Analysis of Cyclin D1
levels in the analysed in the S138A mutant ESCs showed that the level was
significantly reduced in the mutant cells (Figure S2E). As a further test of the
broad effects of the S138A mutation, the level of monoubiquitination of histone
H2AK119 (H2AK119Ub) was measured at gene promoters in ESCs. H2AK119
ubiquitination is mediated the E3 ligase activity of the Polycomb protein RING1B
using UBE2D3 as a ubiquitin donor, and has been shown to be important for
maintaining poising of developmentally regulated promoters in ESCs (Stock et
al., 2007). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was carried out on
chromatin isolated from wild-type and mutant ESCs using primers for a range of
silent and active promoters. The results show a clear increase in the level of
H2AK119Ub across the majority of promoters analysed (Figure S5A and S5B)
and a reduction in binding of S5-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol IIS5Ph) (Figure S5C). Interestingly, we observed increased H2AK119Ub and
reduced RNA Pol II-S5Ph at active as well as silent promoters. This is consistent
with a previous report that RING1B binds to and ubiquitinates active as well as
silent promoter regions in ESCs (Brookes et al., 2012). Overall, our results show
that the increased UBE2D3 levels caused enhanced ubiquitination by a number
of different E3s. This highlights the broad effect that phosphorylation of
UBE2D3-S138 has on ubiquitination and provides a potential explanation for the
very high penetrance phenotype that was observed for the S138A mutation in
mouse embryos.
DISCUSSION
Amniotes first appeared during the Carboniferous period between 314
and 340 Mya (Carroll, 1964; Clack, 2012) and ultimately became the dominant

vertebrate life forms on dry land. The results of this study identify an alanine to
serine substitution that occurred in the common ancestor to modern amniotes,
generating a novel mechanism for regulating the promiscuous ubiquitinconjugating enzyme UBE2D3. The conservation of the alanine residue at position
138 in UBE2D3 from single celled eukaryotes through to modern invertebrate
metazoan and anamniote vertebrates, together with the absolute conservation of
the serine residue in amniotes provides strong evidence that the substitution
was a highly unusual event that happened only once in eukaryotic evolution.
Acquisition of the serine created a phosphorylation site for the cell cycle kinase
Aurora B, and we have shown that phosphorylation of this site drastically
reduces the stability of the UBE2D3 protein by altering the position of the Cterminal a-helix and exposing the hydrophobic core of the protein. This causes a
reduction in the solubility of the protein, targeting it for degradation.
Experiments in mice and ESCs showed that phosphorylation of UBE2D3S138 is required for mouse embryonic development. Intriguingly, the strongest
effect of the mutation that we observed in ESCs and embryos was on the
differentiation of extraembryonic endoderm lineages (PrE and VE), which are
known to have important roles in the formation of the amniote extraembryonic
membranes and in the positioning of the primitive streak during gastrulation in
chick and mouse embryos (Ferner and Mess, 2011; Stern and Downs, 2012).
The experiments using PLA provide clear evidence that the S138A
mutation affects the functioning of the E3 ligase CBL, with increased interaction
between UBE2D3 and CBL and between CBL and two of its target RTKs, PDGFRa
and FGFR1, observed during differentiation of S138A mutant ESCs into XEN cells.
Ubiquitination by CBL is essential for mouse development, with mice that are
null for the two major isoforms c-CBL and CBL-b showing an embryonic lethal
phenotype before E10.5 (Naramura et al., 2002). Our results provide evidence
that regulation of CBL activity is also essential for mouse embryonic
development and we show that the increased CBL activity resulting from
upregulation of UBE2D3 in the S138A mutant cells is associated with
downregulation of FGFR1 and PDGFRa in differentiating XEN (PrE) cells. In
addition to their roles in PrE differentiation, FGFR1 is involved in embryonic
growth and mesodermal patterning during gastrulation (Deng et al., 1994;
16

Yamaguchi et al., 1994) and PDGFRa is required for regulation of neural crest
development, somite patterning and craniofacial development (Soriano, 1997;
Xu et al., 2005). Reduced activity of both of these RTKs is likely to contribute to
the very strong effect embryonic lethal effect that we observe for the UBE2D3S138A mutation.
In addition to the effects on CBL, we also observed increased
ubiquitination of histone H2AK119 at repressed and active genes in S138A
mutant ESCs and downregulation of Cyclin D1. Both of these proteins are known
targets for ubiquitination that uses UBE2D3 as a ubiquitin donor (Bentley et al.,
2011; Mittal et al., 2011). It is notable that we did not obtain significant numbers
of heterozygotes or mosaics for the S138A mutation at E12.5, which suggests
that the mutation causes a general cell autonomous defect that affects survival of
the majority of cell lineages in the developing embryo. This could be a reflection
of the number of different E3s that are able to use UBE2D3 as a ubiquitin donor.
The promiscuous activity of UBE2D3 is an intrinsic function of the protein
(Brzovic and Klevit, 2006) that is highly conserved, as evidenced by the very high
homology exhibited by UBE2D3 orthologues across eukaryotic lineages. UBE2D3
also has the ability to synthesise different types of ubiquitin chains. In addition,
UBE2D3 operates in a complex regulatory environment within the cell, which is
populated in mammals by around 30 E2 enzymes with varying specificities for
around 600 partner E3s. The functioning of E2 enzymes involves co-operative
action between different E2s and also, potentially, competition between E2s for
access to partner E3s. Promiscuous proteins are known to confer evolvability by
virtue of being able to adopt novel functions and regulatory roles (Aharoni et al.,
2005). We hypothesise that the A138S substitution and the acquisition of
phosphoregulation of UBE2D3 levels by Aurora B at the anamniote to amniote
transition is an example of this type of acquisition that altered the ubiquitination
landscape in the ancestral amniote lineage.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Comparative analysis of UBE2D3 amino acid sequences
Vertebrate sequences: The UBE2D3 protein sequence comparison was based on
protein sequences downloaded from the UCSC 100-way MULTIZ alignment for

hg19 exons against 100 vertebrate species. Protein sequences were checked
manually for accuracy using gene sequences from the UCSC browser, NCBI or
ENSEMBL (see below). UBE2D3 genes were identified by the presence of an
additional minor alternative exon (exon-7a) that lies upstream from the
predominantly used exon-7b and is specific to UBE2D3 (see Supplementary
Methods). Manually annotated fish UBE2D3 sequences, in particular, differed
significantly from the sequences produced by automated annotation. This is
probably due to the high homology between UBE2D3 family members. Sources
and sequence co-ordinates or accession numbers for the UBE2D3 gene are
shown in Table S2. Full details of the approaches used to identify UBE2D3 genes
and verify the protein sequences can be found in Supplementary Methods.
Carolina Anole Lizard (Anolis carolinensis): Due to problems with annotation of
the UBE2D3 sequence of the Carolina Anole Lizard, the sequence was obtained
by mining of transcriptome data (see Supplementary Methods).
Axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum): Candidate partial UBE2D3 sequences from
were obtained by blasting the Axolotl genomic sequence using the exon-6 and
exon-7 sequences from the Tibetan frog (Nanorana parkeri). As it was not
possible to determine which of these sequences is UBE2D3 due to the absence of
the diagnostic exon-7a, both are shown in Figure 1 as Axolotl-1 and -2 (see
Supplementary Methods).
Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca): The annotated UBE2D3 sequence for the
Giant Panda contains a cluster of 4 variant residues at positions 112, 113, 115,
116. Since 3 of these residues are invariant in all other eukaryotes examined, we
concluded that the apparent variation in the Giant Panda sequence was the
result of a sequencing error. Therefore, the Giant Panda was omitted from the
sequence comparison.
Sequences from non-vertebrate eukaryotes. Sequences of UBE2D3 homologues
from representatives of non-vertebrate eukaryotic lineages were mined from the
Uniprot database by blasting the entire database with conserved sequences from
amino-terminal and C-terminal regions of Drosophila melanogaster UBCD1 that
did not include position-138. The sequences used for the blast were:
MALKRINKEL; REWTRKYA; REWTRKYAM. Sequences were also obtained by

examination of protein sequences of individual E2 conjugating enzymes from
model organisms in the Uniprot database.
Mice
All work involving mice was carried out under the regulations of the British
Home Office and was approved by the Imperial College Animal Welfare and
Ethical Review Body. To generate mouse embryos with the UBE2D3-S138A
mutation, gRNA for the mutation was transcribed in vitro and injected in
C56Bl6/CBA F1 fertilized oocytes together with Cas9 mRNA and the donor
ssDNA. To obtain E6.5, E7.5 and E12.5 embryos, the injected embryos were
transplanted into foster mothers and harvested at the appropriate time point.
Cells
E14 ESCs (female, 129/Ola) were obtained from the LMS Stem Cells and
Transgenics facility. E14 ESCs were maintained on gelatin coated plates, at 37°C,
5% CO2, in KnockOut Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with
15% fetal bovine serum, 1x NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin,
100 µg/ml streptomycin, 100 µM bME (all reagents from ThermoFisher) and
1000 units/ml LIF (Merck).
ESC differentiation into XEN cells: Differentiation was performed using the
protocol detailed by (Niakan, et al., 2013). For time-lapse imaging of
differentiation (see Supplemental Video 1), cells were transferred on day 4 of
differentiation to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss) where images were
taken at 10 minute intervals until day 8. Images were analysed using Volocity
software (Perkin Elmer).
Aurora B inhibition: ESCs were incubated for 3 hours with 200 nM AZD1152
(Merck) or DMSO in medium.
Protein synthesis inhibition: ESC were incubated for 1h and 5h with 50 µg/ml of
cycloheximide (Cell Signalling Technology) or DMSO in medium.

re-establish the wild type sequence and 5’TTAATTTTATTTTTTAAATAGCTTATTTGTTTGTTTACAGGTACAACAGAATAAGCC
GCGAATGGACTCAGAAGTATGCCATGTGATGCTACCTTACAGTCAGAATAACC-3’ to
introduce an S138S synonymous mutation.
To produce E14 UBE2D3-S138A mutant ESC, 4x106 cells were transfected with 3
µg of pX330 plasmid carrying the appropriate gRNA, 4 µg of the donor ssDNA
and 3 µg of a puromycin resistance plasmid (pCAG-puroR) using the Mouse ES
Cell Nucleofector™ Kit (Lonza) following the manufacturer’s protocol. One day
after transfection cells were subjected to puromycin selection (1.5 µg/ml) for
24h. A week after transfection, individual clones were picked and genotyped by
nested PCR. Mutant genotypes were confirmed by sequencing.
Flow cytometry
All experiments were performed in a LSRII (Becton-Dickinson) and analysed
with FlowJo Software. Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS and
incubated at a densitiy of 106 cell/ml with anti-PDGFRa (1:100) in 2%FBS-PBS
for 20 min at 4°C. After incubation, cells were washed twice, resuspended in
2%FBS-PBS at 5x105 cells/ml and analysed.
Cell cycle analysis: ESCs were trypsinised, washed twice with PBS, fixed with 70%
ethanol for 30 min on ice and washed twice with 2% FBS-PBS. Finally, cells were
resuspended in PBS containing 1µg/ml RNAse A (ThermoFisher), 50 µg/ml
propidium iodide and 0.05% NP40, incubated 20 min at room temperature in the
dark followed by analysis.

Whole-mount immunostaining
Embryos were harvested at the appropriate time point and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde + 0.01% TritonX100 + 0.1% Tween for 20 min at 4°C. Fixed
embryos were washed 3 times for 5 min in 0.1% Triton-PBS (PBT) at room

(2% donkey serum-0.4% TritonX100-PBS) for 2 hours at room temperature.
Incubation with the primary antibodies was carried out at 4°C for 2 days with
the primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. Embryos were then washed
3 x 15 min in PBT, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted
in blocking solution for 2 hours at room temperature, washed again 3 times 15
min in PBT and left ON in PBT+1µg/ml DAPI at 4°C until imaging the next day.
Images were acquired in a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with LAS X software
(Leica) and analysed using Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012). The antibodies used for
embryo staining and their dilutions are indicated in Table S4.
Cell immunostaining

0.4% Tx-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and blocked 1 hour at 37°C
with blocking solution. Incubation with the primary antibodies was performed at
4°C overnight (the antibodies used and their dilutions are indicated in Table S6).
The following day, cells were washed 2x5 min with buffer A, incubated with the
minus and plus probes for 1h at 37°C in antibody diluent solution, washed 2x5
min with buffer A, incubated with Duolink ligation mix 30 min at 37°C, washed
2x5 min with buffer A, incubated with Duolink amplification mix 1h and 40 min
at 37°C, washed 2x10 min with buffer B, 1x5 min with buffer A and
counterstained with anti-Tubulin FITC for 1h at room temperature. After
counterstaining, cells were washed 2x2 min with buffer A, 1x1 min with 0.01x
buffer B and incubated 5 min with 1µg/ml DAPI in PBS. All incubations were
performed in a humidity chamber. Images were acquired in a Leica SP8 confocal
microscope with LAS X software (Leica), PLA foci were quantified with Imaris
software (Oxford Instruments).
Transient expression of UBE2D3 mutant proteins in ESCs
Wt UBE2D3, S138A, S138E and S138D were cloned into the expression vector
pCAG-IRES-GFP (Addgene, plasmid #11159). E14 cells (5 x 106) were transfected
with 10 µg of the appropriate plasmid with the Mouse ES Cell Nucleofector™ Kit
(Lonza) and allowed to grow for 48h after transfection. Cells were then collected
and sorted for GFP expression. UBE2D3 protein levels were analysed by western
blot.
Protein analysis by western blotting
Cells were lysed in ice cold RIPA buffer (50 mM TrisHCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with Complete™ protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche) for 10 min, sonicated (MSE Soniprep150, 3 times 5 sec on/1 min
off, 14 µm amplitude) and cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 14000g.
Concentration of the extracts was measured with the BCA Protein Assay Kit
(ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracts were
diluted in 6x SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS PAGE.
Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-Rad wet tank
blotting system. Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)

in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05%NP40 (TBS-NP40) for 1h at room temperature
and incubated with the primary antibody diluted in 0.5% BSA TBS-NP40 O/N at
4°C. On the following day, membranes were washed 3 times for 20 min with TBSNP40, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1h at room
temperature, washed again 3 times 15 min and developed using Millipore
Crescendo ECL (Merck). For western blot quantification, membranes were
developed and analysed using the ImageQuant LAS400mini and the
ImageQuantTL Software (GE Healthcare). The antibodies used are listed in Table
S6.
In the case of western blots probed with the anti-UBE2D3-S138Ph antibody,
membranes were denatured prior to blocking by incubation for 30 min at 4°C
with 6M guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 1mM PMSF and 5 mM
bME solution.
Protein expression in bacteria and extraction.
The cDNAs of UBE2D3 variants (wt, S138A, S138E, S138D) were cloned into the
pET-N-His (Origene) vector containing a 6xHis N-terminal tag. E. coli BL21(DE3)
cells (Agilent) were transformed with the pET-UBE2D3 plasmids and protein
expression was induced with 0.4 mM IPTG (Merck) for 3h at 37°C. Bacteria were
pelleted and incubated in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10
mM imidazole, 7 mM b-Mercaptoethanol, 300 µg/ml lysozyme) for 30 min at 4°C.
Lysate was then sonicated and spun (15000g, 10 min, 4°C). Supernatant was
collected as soluble fraction and pellet was subjected to the same lysis as before.
The pellet obtained after the second lysis-sonication was resuspended in lysis
buffer, sonicated one more time and collected as the insoluble fraction.
In vitro phosphorylation assay
Recombinant His-UBE2D3 (1 µg) was incubated with 200 ng of GST-AuroraB
(MRC PPU, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland,
mrcppureagents.dundee.ac.uk) for 30 min at 30°C in phosphorylation buffer (50

used for subsequent ubiquitination assays. Phosphorylation was analysed by
western blot.
For the kinase and spin assay, in vitro phosphorylation reactions were
performed as indicated above and the spun for 15 min at 15000g at 4°C, washed
2x with phosphorylation buffer and subsequently analysed by western blot.
Molecular Modeling.
Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D3 (UBE2D3) structure was retrieved from the
Protein Data Bank (PDB: 3UGB) (Page et al., 2012), along with the conjugated
ubiquitin. Two systems were set up: one with the original wild-type structural
and one with a phosphorylation on the Ser138 side-chain. Ubiquitin was
maintained on both simulations, but excluded from the analysis of results. The
phosphorylated Ser138 (Sep138) model was obtained by submitting the original
structure to the CHARMM-GUI server (Jo et al., 2014; Jo et al., 2008). Parameters
to describe the thioester bond between UBE2D3 and ubiquitin were generated
by submitting a dipeptide composed by the two residues that participate in this
interaction (Gly and Cys) to the CGenFF server (Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010; Yu
et al., 2012) and adapted into the CHARMM36 force field.
Atomistic Molecular Dynamics Simulations.
Simulations were performed using the GROMACS simulation suite (2018.3
version) (Abraham et al., 2015) , the CHARMM36 force field (Huang and
MacKerell, 2013) and the TIP3P water model (Jorgensen et al., 1983).
Simulations were performed for 200 ns each, with two independent replicates
for each system (800 ns, overall). The chosen temperature was 340 K in order to
enhance sampling and denaturation of the structures. It was maintained by
making use of the velocity rescale thermostat (Bussi et al., 2007) with a time
constant of 1ps. For pressure coupling, the Parrinello-Rahman barostat
(Parinello et al., 1981) was employed to keep pressure at 1 atm with a time
constant of 1 ps. Particle Mesh Ewald method (Darden et al., 1993) handled the
long-range electrostatics. The LINCS algorithm (Hess et al., 2008) was applied to
constrain bonds, allowing an integration step of 2 fs. Long-range electrostatic
and van der Waals cut-offs were set at 1.4 nm. Charges were neutralized by the

Figure 1. Alignment of the sequences of vertebrate UBE2D3 genes and nonvertebrate UBE2D3 orthologues. Numbering starts from the first residue of the
human sequence. Residues that differ from the human sequence are highlighted
in green with the exception of position 138. The serine and alanine residues at
position138 are indicated by red and yellow boxes respectively. Dashed lines
indicate gaps in some of the available sequences. Full species names and accession
numbers and sources for the sequences are provided in Tables S1 and S2. ⧣The
Axolotl Exon-6 and exon-7 sequences were located for two UBE2D genes by blast
searching the Axolotl genome sequence (for details, see Supplementary Methods).
Sequence comparison indicated that these genes were UBE2D2 or UBE2D3, but it
was not possible to determine which is UBE2D3. Therefore, both sequences are
shown as Axolotl-1 and -2. The sequences differ by a single residue (position 132),
which is occupied by E or A. ¶Duplicated UBE2D3 genes (UBE2D3-a and UBE2D3b) arising from the whole genome duplication that occurred in the common
ancestor to teleost fish.

(RMSF) calculations for unphosphorylated and S138 phosphorylated UBE2D3.
Blue arrows indicate regions of increased mobility in the C-terminal a4-helix
where S138 is located and around P44. (D) Effect of S138 phosphorylation on the
positioning of the C-terminal a4-helix. P44 and Y45 are shown in grey, Y134 and
S138 in blue. The unphosphorylated protein is purple, and the S138
phosphorylated protein is green. In the S138 phosphorylated protein, the a4-helix
has moved away from the loop carrying Pro44 and Tyr45, exposing the
hydrophobic core of the protein. (E) Distance between key residues in the
simulations of the wild type and phosphorylated proteins. The distances were
measured between P44 and S138 (left panel) and between Y45 and Y134 (right
panel) Each curve is averaged over 2 independent simulations. The bars indicate
the standard deviations.
