Abstract
Emergence of the symbiotic lifestyle fostered the immense diversity of all ecosystems on Earth,
but symbiosis plays a particularly remarkable role in marine ecosystems. Photosynthetic
dinoflagellate endosymbionts power reef ecosystems by transferring vital nutrients to their coral
hosts. The mechanisms driving this symbiosis, specifically those which allow hosts to discriminate
between beneficial symbionts and pathogens, are not well understood. Here, we uncover that host
immune suppression is key for dinoflagellate endosymbionts to avoid elimination by the host using
a comparative, model systems approach. Unexpectedly, we find that the clearance of nonsymbiotic microalgae occurs by non-lytic expulsion (vomocytosis) and not intracellular digestion,
the canonical mechanism used by professional immune cells to destroy foreign invaders. We
provide evidence that suppression of TLR signalling by targeting the conserved MyD88 adapter
protein has been co-opted for this endosymbiotic lifestyle, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily
ancient mechanism exploited to facilitate symbiotic associations ranging from coral endosymbiosis
to the microbiome of vertebrate guts.
Main Text
Summary
Symbiotic interactions appear in all domains of life and are key drivers of adaption and
evolutionary diversification. A prime example is the endosymbiosis between corals and eukaryotic,
photosynthetic dinoflagellates, which the hosts take up from the environment by phagocytosis.
Once intracellular, endosymbionts transfer vital nutrients to the corals, a process fundamental for
survival in nutrient-poor environments (Muscatine, 1990; Yellowlees et al., 2008). A central
question is how endosymbionts circumvent the hosts’ defensive strategies to persist intracellularly
and conversely, how hosts prevent invasion by non-symbiotic microorganisms. Here, we use a
comparative approach in the anemone model Exaiptasia pallida (commonly Aiptasia) (Hambleton
et al., 2019; Tolleter et al., 2013; Weis et al., 2008) to address this. Using RNA-seq, we show that
symbiont phagocytosis leads to a broad scale, cell-specific transcriptional suppression of host

innate immunity, but phagocytosis of non-symbiotic microalgae does not. We show that targeting
MyD88 to inhibit canonical TLR signalling promotes symbiosis establishment. Using live imaging
and chemical perturbations, we demonstrate that non-symbiotic microalgae are cleared from the
host by ERK5-dependent vomocytosis (non-lytic expulsion) (Alvarez and Casadevall, 2006;
Gilbert et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2006), and that immune suppression is key for symbiont persistence
and for establishment of an intracellular LAMP1 niche. We propose that expulsion is a fundamental
mechanism of ancient innate immunity used to eliminate foreign cells; a process that is subverted
by symbionts in the endosymbiotic association that forms the foundation of coral reef ecosystems.

Results & Discussion
Phagocytosis of microalgae from the environment is primarily indiscriminate in Aiptasia larvae
The long-term pairings between cnidarian hosts and eukaryotic dinoflagellate symbionts (family
Symbiodinaceae) (LaJeunesse et al., 2018) are evolutionarily ancient and highly specific (Coffroth
et al., 2010; Hambleton et al., 2014; LaJeunesse et al., 2004); yet cnidarians also phagocytose
inert beads (Bucher et al., 2016), associate transiently with heterologous symbiont strains (Dunn
and Weis, 2009; Hambleton et al., 2014; Matthews et al., 2017; Wolfowicz et al., 2016), and with
Chromera velia, a chromerid microalga that is closely related to apicomplexan parasites (Cumbo
et al., 2013; Mohamed et al., 2018). Unlike true symbionts, however, these non-symbiotic
microalgae fail to engage in lasting relationships with their host.
To gain insight into the mechanisms that support intracellular maintenance of symbionts and
removal of non-symbiotic microorganisms, we exploited the ability of naturally aposymbiotic
(symbiont-free) Aiptasia larvae to phagocytose symbionts from the environment (Bucher et al.,
2016; Hambleton et al., 2014; Wolfowicz et al., 2016). We screened seven distinct microalgae
from four phyla (Fig. 1a) and found that, in addition to the dinoflagellate symbiont Breviolum
minutum (strain SSB01) (LaJeunesse et al., 2018; Xiang et al., 2013), Chromera velia, Isochrysis
sp., Chlorella sp., Dunaliella salina, Chlamydomonas parkeae, Nannochloropsis oculata, and
Microchloropsis gaditana (Fig. 1a) are all phagocytosed by the endodermal cells of Aiptasia larvae
(Fig. 1b, Fig. S1). For further comparative analyses we chose C. velia because of its interesting
phylogenetic position, as well as N. oculata and M. gaditana, which have not previously been
observed in association with cnidarians. We confirmed that all three microalgae are fully
internalised using confocal microscopy (Fig. 1c).
To compare long-term host tolerance between symbiotic microalgae and non-symbiotic
microalgae, we quantified infection rates and the number of intracellular microalgae over time. We
found that the proportion of larvae containing symbionts (SSB01) remains relatively constant, even
after removal of microalgae from the environment at 24 hours post infection (hpi) (Fig. 1d). In
contrast, the number of larvae infected with the other algal species decreased over time. The most
rapid reduction occurred with N. oculata, followed by M. gaditana, and a more gradual decrease
with C. velia. While the number of symbiont cells increased due to proliferation within the host
(Fig. 1e) (Hambleton et al., 2014), the mean algal cell count per larva for all the other microalgae
decreased (Fig. 1e). Taken together, our results indicate that phagocytosis of microalgae is largely
indiscriminate, suggesting that decisive symbiont-selection mechanisms occur after uptake, and
that host clearance response varies between the distinct algal types.

Symbiosis establishment broadly suppresses host cell immunity at the transcriptional level
As the sister group to bilaterians, cnidarians have a complex innate immune system that is
implicated in recognising pathogens and managing beneficial microorganisms, including
endosymbionts. Previous transcriptomic analyses comparing aposymbiotic to symbiotic Aiptasia
larvae and adult animals revealed several immune-related genes to be downregulated in response
to symbiosis (reviewed in Mansfield and Gilmore, 2018). Specifically, symbionts have been
proposed to induce immune suppression through NF-κB downregulation, possibly via TGFbsignalling (Berthelier et al., 2017; Detournay et al., 2012; Mansfield et al., 2019, 2017). In contrast,
heterologous microalgae are thought to activate host innate immunity leading to their subsequent
removal (Mansfield et al., 2019; reviewed in Mansfield and Gilmore, 2018; Mohamed et al., 2018).
Selection of true endosymbionts, however, as well as rejection of non-symbiotic microalgae,
occurs at the level of the individual cell. We currently lack direct evidence whether and/or how
symbiont uptake specifically modulates host cell expression of innate immunity related genes, and
how the transcriptional response induced by symbionts compares to that induced by non-symbiotic
microalgae. To address this, we directly compared the host cell transcriptional response postphagocytosis of either symbionts or M. gaditana cells, which are lost rapidly, yet remain
intracellular long enough for analysis (Fig. 1d), using our recently developed cell-specific RNAseq approach (Fig. S2a) (Voss et al., 2019). We infected Aiptasia larvae with M. gaditana for 2448 h, dissociated infected larvae, and sequenced groups of 8-12 endodermal cells that contained
M. gaditana cells and aposymbiotic cells from M. gaditana-infected larvae. We compared
M. gaditana-containing endodermal cells and aposymbiotic endodermal cells to endodermal cells
containing symbionts and aposymbiotic cells from symbiotic larvae, as well as cells from
aposymbiotic larvae (Fig. S2a) (Voss et al., 2019). Using this cell-type specific approach, we found
that only cells containing symbionts are clearly distinct in their overall gene expression when
compared to all other cell types (Fig. 2a, Fig. S2b) (Voss et al., 2019). In contrast, M. gaditanacontaining cells are basically indistinguishable at the transcriptional level from aposymbiotic cells
(Fig. 2a, Fig. S2b), suggesting that the recognition and removal of non-symbiotic microalgae by
the host cell may predominantly be regulated at the post-transcriptional level.
Using our cell-type specific transcriptomic dataset, we compared the expression levels of immunerelated genes (based on KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) annotations for E. pallida) between
the different cell-types (Fig. 2a, Fig. S2a). An array of immune genes was significantly downregulated in symbiont-containing cells, compared to all other cell types (Fig. 2a). This down-

regulation involved 10 KEGG pathways related to metazoan innate immunity with some genes
present in multiple pathways, and multiple transcripts annotated as the same gene (e.g. TRAF3)
(Fig. 2a), but it was the expression of genes associated with NF-κB and AP-1/Jun-related
signalling pathways, such as toll-like receptor pathway (TLR, Fig. 2b) and tumour necrosis factor
(TNF) pathways, that differed most drastically (∼20% of genes from each pathway) (Fig. 2a, Table
S1). This demonstrates for the first time that symbiont phagocytosis massively suppresses
transcription of immunity-related genes in the host at the cellular level. Moreover, in contrast to all
previous organismal-wide analyses, we did not find the NF-κB transcription factor itself to be downregulated in symbiotic cells (Mansfield et al., 2019; Wolfowicz et al., 2016; Mansfield et al., 2017)
suggesting that its own transcriptional regulation is not required for symbiosis establishment.
However, AP-1, a different transcription factor implicated in the TLR pathway is significantly
downregulated in symbiont-containing cells (Fig. 2b).
Out of 382 unique genes involved in immunity, only a few are differentially regulated when
comparing aposymbiotic cells from symbiotic and naïve larvae. Therefore, the transcriptional
profile somewhat resembles the aposymbiotic state; however, some of the genes (11) are
upregulated (Fig. 2a, Table S1). Thus, the explicit host cell response to symbiont phagocytosis is
again distinct from the systemic response in the endoderm of infected Aiptasia larvae.

Modulation of host innate immunity is involved in symbiosis establishment
The substantial suppression of host innate immunity (Fig. 2a) suggests that it is required for
symbiosis establishment within the first 48 h after phagocytosis. To test this, we challenged
aposymbiotic Aiptasia larvae with Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a ligand for mammalian TLR
commonly used to elicit an immune response, for 1 h before, and during infection with microalgae
(Fig. 2c). Strikingly, LPS treatment massively decreased the proportion of symbiont-infected
larvae to 28 % of the untreated control (Fig. 2c), reflecting previous observations in Aiptasia adult
anemones (Detournay et al., 2012). We observed a similar, though less dramatic, effect for
C. velia, but no significant effects for N. oculata and M. gaditana infected larvae (Fig. 2c).
Surprisingly, once symbionts are intracellularly integrated for > 24 h, LPS treatment had no effect
on symbiosis stability (Fig. 2d). Together, this suggests that for both the dinoflagellate symbiont
and the apicomplexan-related ‘invader’, activation of host immunity pathways conflicts with the
initiation of the symbiotic interaction. However, once symbionts are stably integrated into the host
cell, symbiosis stability is not compromised by immune activation, likely due to the fact that a large

proportion of host immune signalling is transcriptionally repressed by that time (Fig. 2a). The
intracellular persistence time of N. oculata and M. gaditana microalgae is unaffected by LPS
suggesting that their loss is independent of immune stimulation or occurs so quickly that any
additional effect is undetectable.
In vertebrates, TLRs act as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and are involved in the
elimination of pathogens; however, commensal bacteria have also been shown to exploit the TLR
pathway by suppressing host immunity to promote host colonisation, suggesting that the host
innate immune system responds distinctly to pathogens and symbionts (Franzenburg et al., 2012;
Koch et al., 2018; Round et al., 2011). During colonisation, the central adapter protein MyD88 has
emerged as a key player to manage the initiation of symbiotic pairings between host and beneficial
microbe. MyD88 promotes re-establishment of bacterial homeostasis after antibiotic treatment in
Hydra vulgaris and is required for an appropriate immune cell response during gut colonisation in
zebrafish larvae (Franzenburg et al., 2012; Koch et al., 2018). Specifically, colonisation with
beneficial microbial communities of zebrafish larvae induces a broad scale, myd88-dependent
transcriptional reprogramming of immunity-related genes in the host, including suppression of
MyD88 itself, as well as the transcription factor AP-1 (Koch et al., 2018), and in H. vulgaris
specifically the AP-1 branch is effect during gut colonisation and in MyD88 silencing (Franzenburg
et al., 2012). Strikingly, we also find that gene expression of large parts of the TLR pathway is
significantly downregulated, including MyD88 (below detection threshold) and AP-1, after
symbiont phagocytosis in Aiptasia larval host cells (Fig. 2a). To directly test whether decreased
MyD88 activity affects retention of symbionts or N. oculata cells, we infected Aiptasia larvae with
both for 24 h, and then inhibited the activity of MyD88 with an inhibitory peptide that blocks MyD88
homodimer formation (Loiarro et al., 2007). We found that MyD88 inhibition significantly increased
the number of larvae that contained symbionts compared to the control; however, no such effect
was observed for N. oculata (Fig. 2e). This suggests that inhibition of MyD88 facilitates symbiont
retention within the first 48 h of infection. More broadly, suppression of MyD88 at the
transcriptional level, and thus modulation of host innate immunity, may be a common strategy
used in distinct symbiotic associations ranging from the vertebrate gut microbiome to cnidariandinoflagellate endosymbiosis to facilitate effective symbiont-host pairings.

Only symbionts establish an intracellular niche, while all other microalgae are expelled

Phagocytosis is an ancient process by which cells internalise large particles from the environment.
Originally utilised by single-celled organisms such as amoeba to acquire food, phagocytosis has
evolved to become an important part of immunity to kill invading microbes in macrophages of
higher metazoans (Flannagan et al., 2012). Accordingly, it seems likely that the non-symbiotic
microalgae are cleared by intracellular digestion, characterised by the consecutive fusion of the
nascent phagosome with endocytic vesicles to ultimately mature into the digestive
phagolysosome. To our surprise, N. oculata- and M. gaditana-containing phagosomes appeared
to be void of the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), a marker protein typically
associated with late endo- and lysosomes destined for digestion. In contrast, LAMP1 was found
to be weakly associated with C. velia-containing phagosomes, and heavily decorating
symbiosomes, the organelle in which the symbiont resides, shortly after uptake (Fig. 3a, Videos
S1-3). Thus, it is the symbionts that rapidly establish a LAMP1-positive niche in which they can
persist intracellularly, and not the non-symbiotic ‘invaders.’ This then raises the question: how are
non-symbiotic microalgae, destined for removal (Fig. 1d), cleared by the host cell after
phagocytosis?
To monitor elimination of non-symbiotic microalgae, we established live imaging to observe their
fate over time. After 24 hpi, larvae were embedded in low-gelling agarose (LGA) and imaged every
15 minutes for 48 h. We selected larvae that appeared to have intracellular microalgae, indicated
by continuous and synchronous movement of both the algal cell and the rotating larva (Video S4);
this was clearly distinct from the non-synchronous movement of microalgae located in the gastric
cavity (* in Video S4). Intracellular symbionts were maintained inside Aiptasia larvae for the entire
duration of the observation period (Fig. 3b, Video S5, Table S2), with the exception of one larva
at one time point in which a pair of symbionts was seen moving asynchronously in the gastric
cavity (Video S6). Furthermore, symbionts frequently replicated (11 replication events/13 larvae)
suggesting that the immobilisation in LGA does not affect larval or symbiont physiology, nor
symbiosis stability.
To our surprise, most larvae that had phagocytosed M. gaditana cells (4/7), N. oculata cells (7/8),
and C. velia cells (6/8) expelled the microalgae rather than digesting them (Fig. 3b, Video S7-9,
Table S2). After expulsion, the microalgae appeared intact and healthy based on the retention of
their autofluorescence and their ability to re-infect larvae. Re-acquisition of non-symbiotic
microalgae by larvae occurred frequently (Table S2). To test whether this was a common response
to inert particles in addition to non-symbiotic microalgae, we imaged larvae containing intracellular
polystyrene beads of the same size as the microalgae. We saw that all of the beads were also

both expelled (11/11) and reacquired (Table S2, Video S10). Interestingly, we found that initial
expulsion of C. velia cells and beads occurred later during imaging when compared to the
expulsion of N. oculata and M. gaditana cells (Fig. 3c); in one event, a C. velia algal cell replicated
during imaging (Video S9). Together, this indicates that non-lytic expulsion, and not
phagolysosomal digestion, is a general response to the uptake of non-symbiotic particles in
Aiptasia larvae. Uptake and subsequent removal appear to occur non-specifically and
continuously, as a trial-and-error mechanism, to probe for suitable particles (e.g. symbionts) in the
environment.

Non-lytic expulsion (vomocytosis) is negatively regulated by ERK5
Interestingly, in both phagotrophic amoeba and vertebrate macrophages, the fungus
Cryptococcus neoformans and certain Candida species are known to be expelled via a process
referred to as vomocytosis (Bojarczuk et al., 2016; Smith and May, 2013). The host phagocyte
remains intact, thus preventing immune stimulation, which is thought to promote dissemination of
the pathogen (Alvarez and Casadevall, 2006; Ma et al., 2006). To directly test if immune activation
via LPS treatment induces symbiont loss by expulsion rather than reduced uptake, we used our
live-imaging assay to monitor their fate. We found that in the presence of LPS, symbionts are
much more likely to be expelled (Fig. 3d). Very early after infection (~1-6 hpi), we observed a
baseline expulsion of symbionts that we did not observe in earlier experiments (Fig 3d), likely due
to the fact that earlier experiments were monitoring a more stable, well-established symbiosis (24
hpi). Thus, immune stimulation by LPS counteracts the robustness of symbiosis establishment
due to the increase in expulsion events of newly phagocytosed symbionts.
In vertebrate macrophages, vomocytosis is negatively regulated by MAPK 7 (ERK5), as well as
the MAPK kinase, MEK5. ERK5 inhibition by XMD17-109 significantly increased rates of
vomocytosis (Gilbert et al., 2017). Aiptasia contains several MAP kinases and one clear ERK5
homolog, with a conserved ATP binding site (aa 61-69 in H. sapiens ERK5 – the target of XMD17109), as well as a clear MEK5 homolog (Fig. S3). To examine whether the function of ERK5 as a
negative regulator of vomocytosis is conserved in Aiptasia, we incubated Aiptasia larvae shortly
before, and during, a 24 h infection period with the inhibitor. Intriguingly, we found that the number
of larvae infected with symbionts was massively reduced upon ERK5 inhibition (Fig. 4a).
Moreover, upon inhibition of ERK5, LAMP1 accumulation on the symbiosome does not occur,
resembling non-symbiotic microalgae-containing phagosomes (Fig. 4b + c). This suggests that

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/864579; this version posted December 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

ERK5 inhibition increases symbiont expulsion via vomocytosis and impairs the niche formation
that is required to initiate a stable partnership between endosymbiont and host cell. More broadly,
vomocytosis is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism utilised by amoeba, cnidarians, and
vertebrates as a means to clear unwanted particles from phagocytic cells (Alvarez and Casadevall,
2006; Ma et al., 2006; Watkins et al., 2018, this study).

Conclusions
We propose a model in which aposymbiotic Aiptasia larvae constitutively acquire particles from
the environment. By default, phagocytosed, non-symbiotic microalgae are removed by
vomocytosis. Acquisition of true symbionts leads to suppression of host innate immunity pathways,
likely the AP-1 branch of the highly conserved TLR signalling, by targeting MyD88. Modulation of
host innate immunity is crucial for symbionts to escape expulsion by vomocytosis and promote
intracellular niche formation (Fig. 4c). More broadly, the initiation of the endosymbiotic association
between dinoflagellate symbionts and cnidarian host cells depends on subverting the innate
immune system; specifically, the removal of invaders by expulsion, and not by phagolysosomal
digestion.
Phagocytosis is an ancient mechanism used by unicellular organisms to acquire and digest food
(Hartenstein and Martinez, 2019). Microbial killing by professional macrophages in higher
metazoans is thought to derive from phagotrophy (Boulais et al., 2010; Hartenstein and Martinez,
2019).

Interestingly,

the

core TLR/NF-κB

pathway has

recently been

identified

in

choanoflagellates suggesting that unicellular organisms may have used phagocytosis for both
prey sensing and immunity (Richter et al., 2018). Although the evolutionary trajectory of
phagocytosis is unclear, it seemed likely that intracellular digestion is a primitive and highly
conserved defence mechanism. Thus, it was highly unexpected that symbionts have to escape
vomocytosis to efficiently establish a stable intracellular symbiotic relationship.
In this context, it is noteworthy that unicellular, phagotrophic amoeba have two redundant, yet
mechanistically distinct expulsion mechanisms: constitutive exocytosis and vomocytosis (Watkins
et al., 2018). Constitutive exocytosis results in the expulsion of undigested remnants of food;
alternatively, pathogens such as C. neoformans, which are protected from digestion by their
polysaccharide capsule (Lee et al., 1995), activate a second route of expulsion, vomocytosis,
possibly in an effort to avoid infection or halt the acquisition of new food. Expulsion of indigestible

material, non-symbiotic microalgae, or even pathogenic microbes may be effective for small,
motile organisms that are in constant contact with the environment, but animals with complex body
plans and organ systems are more susceptible to lasting infections by expelled, yet internally
trapped, microorganisms. Therefore, vomocytosis of unwanted and indigestible particles may be
an evolutionarily ancient defence mechanism that required stricter regulation in higher metazoans,
which focus on microbial killing. This may explain why this phenomenon has been overlooked in
multicellular organisms until recently (Alvarez and Casadevall, 2006; Ma et al., 2006).
Cnidarians, such as corals and anemones, are evolutionarily ancient animals with simple body
plans, yet possess cells with complex immune capacities. Here, we show that the endodermal
cells of cnidarian larvae use distinct mechanisms of innate immunity to abet a post-phagocytic
trial-and-error mechanism for selection of suitable symbionts from the environment. This study
provides valuable insight into regulation of host immunity by symbionts and demonstrates that the
primitive and versatile functions of phagocytosis are exploited by these basal organisms to support
symbiosis and host health.

Methods
Live Organism Culture and Maintenance
Algal maintenance
For infection experiments of Aiptasia larvae, we used Breviolum minutum clade B (SSB01) (Xiang
et al., 2013), Microchloropsis gaditana CCMP526 (NCMA, Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean
Sciences, Maine, USA), Nannochloropsis oculata, and Chromera velia (NORCCA K-1276). All
cultures were grown in cell culture flasks in 0.22 µm filter-sterilized 1X Diago IMK medium (Wako
Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) on a 12-h light:12-h dark (12L:12D) cycle under 20–25 µ mol m−2
s−1 of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Sterile stock cultures of SSB01, N. oculata, and
C. velia were grown at 26 ºC and M. gaditana at 18 ºC. All algal cultures to be used for infections
were kept at 26 ºC for a minimum of 3 days prior to infection.

Aiptasia spawning and larval culture conditions
Aiptasia clonal lines F003 and CC7 (Carolina Biological Supply Company #162865; Burlington,
USA) were induced to spawn following the previously described protocol (Grawunder et al., 2015).
Aiptasia larvae were maintained in glass beakers in filter-sterilized artificial sea water (FASW) at
26 ºC and exposed to a 12L:12D cycle.

Infection assay
Three biological replicates (e.g. distinct spawning events) of naturally aposymbiotic Aiptasia larvae
were collected and diluted to a concentration of 300-500 larvae per millilitre of FASW in glass
beakers. Between 4- and 8-days post fertilisation (dpf), the larvae were infected with 1.0 x 105
algal cells/ml of the respective algal types. Beakers were kept at 26 ºC and exposed to a 12L:12D
cycle. After a 24-h infection, the larvae were washed to remove the microalgae and fresh FASW
was added.

Infected larvae were fixed at 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, and 10-day(s) post infection (dpi) using 4%
formaldehyde solution (#F1635, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT), followed
by two washes in 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-Triton) (#3051, Carl Roth GmbH), and mounted in 87%

1,4-

Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan (DABCO) (#D27802, Sigma-Aldrich). At least 50 larvae per replicate per
algal type were counted, and representative differential interference contrast (DIC) and epifluorescent images of the algal autofluorescence were taken. Microscopic analysis was conducted
with a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope using a Nikon Plan Fluor 40x air objective. Images
were processed with Fiji software (Schindelin et al., 2012).

Imaging and staining procedures in Aiptasia larvae
Fluorescent staining for f-actin
Infected larvae were fixed 24 hpi using 4% formaldehyde solution for 30 minutes at RT, followed
by one wash in 0.05% Tween20 (#P7949, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (PBS-Tween20) for 5 minutes.
For permeabilisation, larvae were rotated in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes at 0.25 rpm in a solution of
1% PBS-Triton and 20% DMSO (#67-68-5, fisherscientific) for 1 h at RT. For blocking, the
permeabilisation solution was exchanged with 5% normal goat serum (#005-000-121, Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) in 0.05% PBS-Tween20. Larvae remained in the blocking
buffer for 30 minutes at RT while rotating. After two washes in 0.05% PBS-Tween20, larvae were
incubated in Phalloidin Atto 565 (#94072, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:200 in 0.05% PBS-Tween20
on a rotor and protected from light. Larvae were washed three times in 0.05% PBS-Tween20
before incubation in 10 µg/ml Hoechst (#B2883, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in Tris-buffered saline, pH
7.4; 0.1% Triton X-100; 2% bovine serum albumin (#A7906, Sigma-Aldrich); 0.1% sodium azide
(#S2002, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes on a rotor at RT in the dark. Larvae were washed three
times for 5 minutes with 0.05% PBS-Tween20 and washed step-wise into glycerol from 30% to
50% to 100% and finally mounted. Confocal microscopic analysis was carried out with a Leica
TCS SP8 stand using 63x glycerol immersion objective (NA 1.30), Leica LAS X software and Fiji
software (Schindelin et al., 2012). Hoechst, Atto 565, and symbiont autofluorescence were excited
with 405, 561, and 633 nm laser lines, respectively. Fluorescence emission was detected at 410501 nm for Hoechst, 542-641 nm for Phalloidin Atto 565, and 645-741 for symbiont
autofluorescence.

Live imaging
For live imaging of infected larvae, chambers were prepared by placing two 2.5 mm x 5 mm strips
of non-toxic double-sided tape (TES5338, Tesa) at the periphery of 35 mm µ-Dishes (# 81166,
Ibidi). 1.5% low gelling agarose (LGA) (#A4018, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in FASW by heating
to 80 ºC until liquid. The liquid LGA was cooled to and kept at 37 ºC until use. 300 larvae in a
volume of 1 ml were placed in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf centrifuge tube and quickly vortexed using a
Sprout mini centrifuge (#552021, Biozym Scientific GmbH) to pellet larvae. The larvae and 1.5%
LGA at 37 ºC were mixed for a final LGA concentration of 1.14% LGA. The mixture was pipetted
into the center of the prepared imaging chamber and a glass coverslip was pressed on top of the
droplet as to adhere on either end to the double-sided tape. The Ibidi plate was filled with 2 ml of
FASW. Microscopic analysis was conducted with a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope using a
Nikon Plan Fluor 20x air objective, with images taken every 15 minutes in DIC and TexasRed
channels. Images were processed with Fiji software (Schindelin et al., 2012).

Immunofluorescence staining (LAMP1)
Larvae were fixed for 45 minutes in 4% formaldehyde at RT, followed by three washes in 0.2%
PBS-Triton and one wash in PBS. Larvae were then permeabilised in PBS-Triton for 1.5 h at RT,
followed by blocking in 5% normal goat serum and 1% BSA in PBS-Triton for 1 h. Primary antibody
(rabbit-α-LAMP1) (Voss et al., 2019) was diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer and incubated overnight
at 4°C. After three washes in PBS-Triton, the secondary antibody (goat-α-rabbit AlexaFluor 488,
#ab150089, abcam) was diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer and incubated for 1.5 h at RT. Larvae
were washed two times in PBS-Triton, followed by a 15-minute incubation with 10 µg/ml Hoechst
protected from light at RT, and two final washes in PBS-Triton and one in PBS before mounting
in 87% glycerol. Larvae were imaged on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope
using a 63x glycerol immersion lens (NA 1.30) and Leica LAS X software. Hoechst, Alexa 488,
and symbiont autofluorescence were excited with 405, 496, and 633 nm laser lines, respectively.
Fluorescence emission was detected at 410-501 nm for Hoechst, 501-541 nm goat-α-rabbit
AlexaFluor 488, and 645-741 for symbiont autofluorescence.

Transcriptome
Computational methods
RNA sequencing data from Voss, et al. (2019) was complemented with data for larvae infected
with M. gaditana, acquired in the same way. Paired reads were mapped to the Aiptasia genome
version GCF_001417965.1 using HISAT2 version 2.1.0 at default settings, except –X 2000 --nodiscordant --no-unal --no-mixed. Transcripts were quantified in Trinity v2.5.1 using salmon v0.10.2
at default settings. Principal component analysis was conducted using a perl script supplied with
Trinity for all samples. Differential expression was analysed using in R! v3.5.2 (R Core Team,
2018). DEseq2 (Love et al., 2014) (log2-fold change ≥ 1, adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05). Graphing of
results was restricted to pathways involved in innate immunity as found in KEGG (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000), using the R! package “ComplexHeatmap” (Gu et al., 2016) in KNIME (Berthold et al.,
2007). The custom KNIME workflow used for processing and analysing the data are freely
available from the corresponding author upon request.

Exogenous immune perturbations
LPS/ ERK5 inhibitor treatment
Aiptasia larvae were washed and diluted to a concentration of 300-500 larvae/ml and were then
incubated with 20 µg/µl LPS (lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli O127:B8, Sigma-Aldrich),
1 µm XMD17-109 (0.1% DMSO [Dimethylsulfoxid, Carl-Roth]), 0.1 % DMSO, or without for 1 hour.
Algal cultures were then added to a final concentration of 1 x 105 microalgae/ml of the respective
algal types and incubated at 26 ºC and exposed to a 12L:12D cycle. After a 24-hour infection, the
larvae were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 minutes, washed in PBS, and mounted in 100%
glycerol for counting. Infection status was quantified in at least 100 larvae per infection using a
Nikon Eclipse Ti epifluorescent microscope, utilising algal autofluorescence.

LPS post-infection treatment
Washed and diluted Aiptasia larvae (300-500 / ml) were mixed with B. minutum (1x105 microalgae
/ ml) and left for infection at 26 °C with a 12L:12D cycle for 24 hours. They were then

washed/filtered to remove excess microalgae and incubated further for 24 hours. Half of the
infected larvae were exposed to 20 µg/ml of LPS for 24 hours, before fixation with 4%
formaldehyde. They were then washed in PBS and mounted in glycerol. Infection status was
assessed in at least 100 larvae per infection using a Nikon Eclipse Ti epifluorescent microscope,
utilising algal autofluorescence.

Early infection LPS treatment live imaging
Aiptasia larvae (300-500) were either incubated with 20 µg/ml LPS or not for 1 hour, before
infection with B. minutum (1x105 microalgae / ml) for 1 hour. They were then mounted in µ-Dishes
as described previously and then imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope using a Nikon
Plan Fluor 20x air objective, with images taken every 5 min in DIC and TexasRed channels.
Images were processed with Fiji software (Schindelin et al., 2012). For each independent
experiment (n=3), between 7 and 14 larvae were observed.

MyD88 inhibitor peptide treatment
6 dpf larvae were infected with 1.0 x 105 cells/ml of SSB01 or N. oculata for 24 hours. Infected
larvae were washed with FASW to remove microalgae from water and 10 units penicillin and 10
µg streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Infected larvae were incubated for 24 hours at 26
ºC under a 12L:12D cycle with either 50 µM of MyD88 inhibitor peptide or 50 µM control peptide
(NBP2-29328, Novus Biologicals). Larvae were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and infection efficiency

LAMP1 assessment after ERK5 inhibitor treatment
Aiptasia larvae were exposed to 1 µM ERK5 inhibitor (XMD17-109) or not for 1 h prior to and
during infection with 1.0 x 105 cells/ml of SSB01 for 5 h. Larvae where then stained for LAMP1 as
described above. Fracture of symbionts with strong LAMP1 staining were assessed on a Leica
TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope using a 63x glycerol immersion lens (NA 1.30) and

Leica LAS X software. For control 20 larva each were evaluated, due to low infection numbers in
XMD17-109 treated larvae, only 8, 4 and 7 larvae could be evaluated in the replicates.

ERK5 / MEK5 phylogeny
To resolve the evolutionary history and classification of Aiptasia MAPKs and MAP2Ks we first
used well-defined ‘bait’ sequences (human MAPK7 and MAP2K5) and reciprocal BLAST searches
to identify and collate the MAPK and MAP2K repertoire in Aiptasia. Aiptasia sequences were then
used to retrieve other MAPK and MAP2K sequences of animals including key cnidarian species
from public databases using BLASTP. H. echinata sequences were downloaded from
https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/hydractinia/download/ and manually curated and translated.
Resulting protein sequences were deduplicated and then aligned using ClustalW (GONNET, goc:
3, gec: 1.8). Then automated trimming was performed using trimAI (using standard
parameters; http://trimal.cgenomics.org/, (Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009)). Best-fitting amino acid
substitution models were determined using ModelFinder (-m MF -msub nuclear -nt AUTO) within
iqTree and Maximum likelihood trees generated. Trees were finalised using FigTree 1.4.4
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and Adobe Illustrator CC 2018. Original tree files are
available upon request

Statistical notes
Statistic test and number of replicates are given in text or figure legends. In general, two-sided ttest were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.2 for Mac, GraphPad Software, La Jolla
California USA, www.graphpad.com. Paired t-test were performed for all experiments, except for
experiments represented in Fig. 3 where experimental set-up did not permit side-by-side execution
and unpaired t-test were used instead. Individual experiments from distinct samples (n) are shown
as data points.
