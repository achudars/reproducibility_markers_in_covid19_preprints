Abstract
The non-enzymatic replication of the primordial genetic material is thought to have enabled the
evolution of the first ribozymes, leading to early forms of RNA-based life. However, the
reported rate of chemical RNA ligation is extremely slow. Here we show that the rate of ligation
can be greatly enhanced by employing a 3ʹ-amino group at the 3ʹ-end of each oligonucleotide, in
combination with an N-alkyl imidazole organocatalyst. These modifications allow the rapid
copying of long RNA templates by multi-step ligation of tetranucleotides, as well as the
assembly of long oligonucleotides from short template splints. Our work shows that a functional
RNA ligase ribozyme can be assembled from relatively short oligonucleotides, demonstrating a
transition from non-enzymatic ligation to enzymatic ligation. We suggest that the genomes of
primitive protocells could have consisted of relatively easily replicated oligonucleotides as short
as 10 to 12 nucleotides in length.
Main Text
The RNA world hypothesis posits an early stage in the evolution of life during which RNA was
both the carrier of genetic information and the catalyst of cellular reactions1–4. This model is
supported by the in vitro evolution of ribozymes with RNA polymerase activity5–7. However,
prior to the emergence of the first RNA replicase ribozyme, genetic polymers must have relied
on non-enzymatic self-replication processes to survive8. The current lack of an efficient pathway
for non-enzymatic RNA replication is the main obstacle towards building a model protocell
capable of growth, division, and therefore Darwinian evolution9. Recent progress in template
copying chemistry with activated mononucleotide substrates has enabled the copying of mixedsequence RNA templates up to 7 nt long in solution and 5 nt long inside a model protocell10,11. In
more artificial scenarios, it has been possible to copy bead-immobilized templates up to 12 nt in
length, completing a functional ribozyme sequence12. In spite of this progress, it is not yet
possible to copy, in an effective and prebiotically plausible manner, RNA templates long enough
to encode ribozymes that might enable RNA catalyzed self-replication processes13,14.

As an alternative to mononucleotide polymerization, templates might be copied by the ligation of
short oligomers to generate longer products15. However, the slow rate and low yield of templatedirected RNA ligation12,16 has precluded the copying of long, functional sequences by ligation.
In an effort to overcome this problem, the Orgel and von Kiedrowski laboratories used EDC
driven ligation of oligonucleotides with 3ʹ-amino-RNA or 3ʹ-phosphoryl-DNA to demonstrate
the copying of tetramer and hexamer templates by the ligation of dimer and trimer substrates
respectively17,18. Unfortunately, no example of long RNA copying with rapid chemical ligation
has been reported in the subsequent 30 years. Recently, the Hud laboratory demonstrated the Ncyanoimidazole driven ligation of DNA tetramers into long polymers with the help of
intercalators to stabilize the tiled tetramer arrays19. However this approach failed with RNA
tetramers, and no prebiotically plausible intercalator has been reported. The Richert group has
recently shown that the rapid cyclization of activated di- and tri-nucleotides significantly limits
the ligation of such substrates20. Despite these challenges, template copying by ligation remains
attractive, as it requires fewer reaction steps to copy a template of a given length. A ligation
approach could also overcome other problems that are severe for monomer polymerization, such
as copying through secondary structures, copying A/U rich sequences21, and copying the last
nucleotide of a template22. Moreover, short oligomers would have been prebiotically accessible,
as inevitable products of reactions between activated monomers both on and off template23. In
light of these advantages, further studies of non-enzymatic ligation are needed to evaluate the
potential of ligation mediated pathways for template assembly and copying.
Here we explore the use of highly reactive oligonucleotide substrates in non-enzymatic template
directed ligation. We use short oligoribonucleotides terminated with 3ʹ-amino-2ʹ,3ʹ-dideoxyribonucleotides as substrates, because the 3ʹ-amino moiety is a stronger nucleophile than the 3ʹhydroxyl of ribonucleotides. Although 3ʹ-amino oligonucleotides are not prebiotically realistic,
they are an excellent model for the study of how RNA oligonucleotides might behave if the
nucleophilicity of the 3ʹ-hydroxyl could be enhanced, for example by delivery of a catalytic
metal ion to the reaction center. We used 2-methylimidazole for 5ʹ-phosphate activation, together
with the organocatalyst 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)imidazole (HEI) to provide enhanced activation24,25.
Together, these modifications allow for the non-enzymatic copying by ligation of templates up to
at least 32 nt in length. We also show that oligonucleotides only 4-nt long can assemble into
products longer than 140 nt. Finally, we show that a functional RNA ligase ribozyme can be
assembled by the splinted ligation of sets of 10-12 nt long oligonucleotides.
We began by quantitatively assessing the effects of a 3ʹ-amino vs. a 3ʹ-hydroxyl nucleophile on
the rate of template-directed oligonucleotide ligation. Using an RNA primer containing either a
canonical ribonucleotide or a 3ʹ-amino-2ʹ,3ʹ-dideoxyribonucleotide residue at the 3ʹ-end (Fig. 1a,
Fig. S1), we measured the rate of primer ligation as a function of concentration of the ligator
oligonucleotide, a 2-methylimidazole activated RNA tetramer. The observed maximal rate (kobs
2+
was 0.027 h-1 (Fig. 1b, Fig.
max) of the RNA ligation reaction in the presence of 100 mM Mg
2+
S2a). RNA ligation in the absence of Mg was too slow to measure, while the ligation rate
continued to increase up to ~0.1 h-1 at 1.6 M Mg2+(Fig. S3). Under the same 100 mM Mg2+
conditions, substitution of the last nucleotide on the RNA primer with a 3ʹ-amino-2ʹ,3ʹdideoxyribonucleotide enhanced the ligation rate by over 50-fold; giving a kobs max of 1.6 h-1 (Fig.
1c, Fig. S2b). Notably, without Mg2+, kobs max reached an even higher value of 5.1 h-1 (Fig. 1c, Fig.
S2c). Our results show that Mg2+ accelerates the N3ʹ–P5ʹ ligation rate only at low concentrations
of the ligator oligonucleotide. When the concentration of the ligator is sub-saturating, Mg2+
stabilizes duplex formation and improves the kobs. At higher, saturating concentrations of

tetramer or with a longer ligator, such that the template is saturated even in the absence of Mg2+,
the presence of Mg2+ lowers kobs max, for reasons that remain unclear (Fig. S3-S7).
The organocatalyst 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)imidazole (HEI) enhances the non-enzymatic polymerization rate of imidazole activated monomers24,26. HEI is thought to act as a nucleophilic catalyst
that exchanges with the 2-methylimidazole moiety on the activated nucleotides, generating a
more reactive imidazolium leaving group. As expected, the presence of HEI increased the rate of
RNA ligation in the presence of 100 mM Mg2+ by more than ten-fold, such that kobs max reached
0.40 h-1 (Fig.1d, Fig. S8a). Similarly, HEI also increased the rate of the N3ʹ–P5ʹ ligation by more
than ten-fold to a kobs max of 21 h-1 and 43 h-1, in the presence and absence of 100 mM Mg2+
respectively (Fig. 1e, Fig. S8b, Fig. S8c).
Encouraged by the greatly enhanced ligation rate resulting from the combination of a 3ʹ-amino
nucleophile and the HEI organocatalyst, we applied these advances to the copying of longer
RNA templates by multi-step ligation. We first tested the copying of a 32 nt RNA template
containing eight 5ʹ-UCAG-3ʹ repeats (Fig. 2a) in the presence of 400 μM of the tetramer 2MeImp-CUGA-3ʹ-NH2. With HEI, we observed a ~20% yield of full-length product within 10
minutes and more than 60% within 40 minutes. Consistent with our previous results, Mg2+
inhibited ligation, leading to increased levels of a ladder of stalled products corresponding to the
stepwise addition of tetramers. After two hours, we did not observe any further increase in the
yield of full-length product, and the stalled products remained unchanged in intensity. To test the
hypothesis that the stalled products arise from templates occupied by hydrolyzed (i.e.
unactivated) downstream ligator oligonucleotides, we repeated the ligation experiments but
added multiple aliquots of the coupling reagent EDC after the initial stage of the reaction was
largely complete. In the absence of Mg2+, this strongly decreased the background of stalled
products and significantly increased the yield of full-length product (Fig. S9). The effect of EDC
was much smaller in the presence of Mg2+, possibly due to Mg2+-enhanced EDC hydrolysis. We
suggest that more prebiotically plausible chemistry that could re-activate hydrolyzed ligator
oligonucleotides, such as the recently described isonitrile activation pathway27, might also
significantly increase the yield of full-length product in multi-step template copying reactions.
We then examined the copying of a 16 nt template with a non-repeating sequence, in the
presence of four different tetramers at 50 μM each (Fig. 2b). As before, full-length product was
formed rapidly in the presence of HEI, with ~35% full-length product observed by 30 minutes
and more than 60% at 2 hours. In this system, Mg2+ significantly improved the rate of full-length
product formation. This effect was particularly notable for the addition of the last tetramer 2MeImp-GAAA, where Mg2+ likely facilitated binding of this A-rich tetramer. Thus, the
combination of a 3ʹ-amino nucleophile, HEI catalysis and Mg2+ allows for the rapid and high
yielding copying of mixed sequence RNA templates.
Although multi-step ligation allows the copying of long RNA templates, the thermal stability of
the resulting long RNA duplexes makes it difficult to separate the strands so that the product
strand could either fold into an active ribozyme or act as a template for the next round of
copying9. We therefore asked if multi-step ligation could be directed by short RNA template
splints which could dissociate more easily. Enzyme-catalyzed splinted ligation28 is widely used
to generate RNA products that are much longer than the starting materials, hinting at a plausible
chemical pathway for emergence of the first long ribozyme sequences or templates in the preRNA world. We therefore asked whether long oligonucleotides could assemble starting from the
splint template 5ʹ-AGUC-3ʹ, and the activated tetramer 2-MeImp-CUGA-3ʹ-NH2 (Fig. 3a). The

template and the ligator can assemble into tiled arrays held together by two base pairs on each
side of each tetramer. To monitor the non-enzymatic ligation reaction, we used a 5ʹfluorescently-labeled primer containing a 3ʹ-amino terminus hybridized to a template with a 5ʹAG overhang. We tested the reaction with and without 100 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM HEI. In this
experiment, the limiting factor is the weak binding between the two-nucleotide overlaps. We
therefore conducted the experiment on ice, with 200 mM NaCl, to promote pairing. MgCl2
helped to stabilize the tiled arrays and therefore greatly enhanced the long oligo formation,
resulting in >140 nt products within 1 day. When using both MgCl2 and HEI, >100 nt products
formed within 6 hours (Fig. 3b). This experiment serves as a proof-of-concept that nonenzymatic ligation is capable of generating long oligomers without pre-existing long templates.
Having established that long RNA strands could assemble from short oligonucleotides via
splinted ligation, we asked whether non-enzymatic ligation could lead to the formation of
functional ribozymes. The nonenzymatic assembly of an RNA ligase ribozyme is a tantalizing
prospect, since this type of ribozyme could represent a key intermediate in the transition from the
pre-RNA world to the RNA world. Recently, the Holliger group reported the assembly of an
RNA polymerase ribozyme by the nonenzymatic ligation of six 20-nt and one 30-nt long 2methylimidazole activated RNA oligonucleotides in 0.5% overall yield29. However, T7 RNA
polymerase transcription of RT-PCR amplification product was needed to demonstrate ribozyme
activity, possibly because of the failure of the 20-30 nt splints to dissociate from the assembled
product. In order to study a simpler and more prebiotically relevant model system, we decided to
examine the assembly of a much smaller ligase ribozyme from shorter oligonucleotides. The
Joyce group has reported a highly-efficient RNA ligase ribozyme of 52-nt in length, which can
ligate a 14-nt 5′-triphosphate RNA substrate to its 3′-end 30. We designed an experiment to
generate this particular ligase from five different oligomers, varying from ten to twelve
nucleotides in length (Fig. 4), with ligation directed by four different 10-nt splint
oligonucleotides. Preliminary experiments with DNA splints showed efficient assembly of fulllength ribozyme, which upon dilution into ribozyme buffer exhibited the expected ligase
catalytic activity at the optimal temperature of 48°C (Fig. S10). Subsequent experiments with
RNA splints of the same length and sequence also exhibited excellent assembly of the full-length
ligase ribozyme, but upon dilution into ribozyme buffer, no ligase activity was detected at 48°C,
presumably due to inhibition by the tightly bound RNA splint oligonucleotides (Fig. S11).
Shorter 8-nt splints resulted in a severe loss of ribozyme assembly efficiency. We therefore
introduced a number of G:U wobble pairs between the splint-templates and the ligator
oligonucleotides, to lower the melting temperature while maintaining specific binding. In
addition, one of the four splints was shortened to 9-nt, instead of 10-nt. In this non-enzymatic
ligation experiment, the mixture of the splints and ligators gave rise to the 52-nt product at ~50%
yield within 6 hrs, and ~66% in 48 hrs (Fig. 5c, Fig. S12). To test the ligase activity of assembled
product, we diluted the ligation reaction into ribozyme ligase buffer containing the 5′triphosphate substrate, and incubated the mixture at 48°C. Strikingly, the 52-nt product of the
non-enzymatic ligation reaction could efficiently perform the enzymatic ligation reaction with
the 5′-triphosphate RNA substrate (Fig. 5c).
Our work suggests a scenario for the origin of life in which the replicating genomic
oligonucleotides in the first protocells were much smaller than previously considered. Because
reasonably active ribozyme nucleases are generally larger than 25-50 nucleotides in length, with
ligases and polymerases being substantially longer, it had generally been assumed that
replicating genomic fragments had to be at least 25 nucleotides in length if not longer. Even

when ribozymes are assembled from multiple oligonucleotides, the fragments lengths are
typically ≥ 25 nucleotides long. Copying sequences of this length by primer extension remains
an unsolved problem, and even if that problem can be solved, complete cycles of replication will
require a means of overcoming the thermodynamic stability of such long RNA duplexes so that
the separate strands can be copied. In contrast, the full replication of oligonucleotides in the
range of 10-12 nucleotides long seems much more plausible, both in terms of template copying
and because of the lower melting temperature of such short duplexes. Oligonucleotides only 1012 nucleotides long are unlikely to exhibit useful catalytic activities individually, but could
assemble by multiple splinted ligation reactions into much longer oligonucleotides that could
indeed act as efficient ribozymes, as shown by our assembly of an active ribozyme ligase by a
series of nonenzymatic ligation reactions.
Demonstrating cycles of replication of genomic RNA oligonucleotides and the concurrent
assembly of longer functional ribozymes will require overcoming several obstacles. First, the
efficient copying of RNA templates of 10-12 nucleotides length must be achieved either by
monomer polymerization, by the ligation of small oligomers, or by some combination thereof.
Second, efficient splinted-ligation must be achieved with RNA so that longer functional (but
non-replicating) sequences can be assembled. Third, the duplex products of oligonucleotide
copying must dissociate in order to allow for iterated cycles of replication. Finally, the affinity of
splint-templates for their ligator oligonucleotides must be high enough to allow for efficient
ligation, but the affinity of the splints for the ligated product strand must be low enough to allow
for splint dissociation, so that the assembled product strand can fold into an active ribozyme. The
first two problems would benefit from an effective way of increasing the nucleophilicity of the
RNA 3ʹ-hydroxyl, perhaps by some means of delivering an appropriate catalytic metal ion to the
reaction center. The third problem might be overcome if either strand displacement or strand
separation could be triggered by transient environmental changes, for instance, temperature
fluctuations or salt concentration fluctuations following wet-dry cycles. The final problem of
achieving splint specificity (so as to correctly program ribozyme assembly) with only moderate
affinity was an unexpectedly difficult hurdle in our efforts to demonstrate the assembly of an
RNA ligase through nonenzymatic ligation. RNA splints that had only 3-4 nucleotides of
complementarity to two ligator oligonucleotides led to slow and/or inaccurate ligation, and thus
inefficient assembly. On the other hand, splints with 10-12 nucleotides of complementarity to the
ligated product strand failed to dissociate, leading to inhibition of the assembled ribozyme. We
found that the introduction of wobble mis-matches allowed RNA splints to accurately direct
ribozyme assembly through iterated ligation events without inhibiting the assembled ribozyme.
Similarly, DNA splints exhibited excellent specificity with low enough affinity to avoid
ribozyme inhibition. Prebiotically, it is possible that the admixture of low levels of deoxy-,
arabino- or threo- nucleotides into RNA oligonucleotides could have had the same effect, as well
as potentially decreasing duplex stability enough to facilitate multiple cycles of replication. The
identification of roles for weakly binding oligonucleotides is reminiscent of our previously
described mechanism for the homeostatic modulation of ribozyme activity by short
oligonucleotides that inhibit ribozyme folding at high concentrations, but dissociate and thereby
lead to ribozyme activation following the dilution that occurs during protocell growth31. Solving
the related problems of oligonucleotide replication and splint-directed ribozyme assembly may
lead to further insights into the origins of life in an RNA world.

Figure 3: The non-enzymatic ligation reaction of tetramers leading to the formation of long
oligomers without a pre-existed long template. (a) Schematic representation of the reaction. The
splint template is the non-activated tetramer 5ʹ-AGUC. The ligator is 2-MeImp-CUGANH2. The
duplex of 5ʹ-Cy3-labeled primer with 3ʹ-ANH2 and 5ʹ-AG-overhang RNA template was used to
monitor the reaction. (b) PAGE shown for the ligation reactions leading to the formation of >140
nt products within 1 day. The reactions contained 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 μM AGUC, 500
μM 2-MeImp-CUGANH2, 200 mM NaCl, with/without 100 mM MgCl2 or 100 mM HEI as noted.
The experiments were carried out on ice in triplicate.

Figure 4: The transition from non-enzymatic ligation to enzymatic ligation. (a) Schematic
representation of the experiment design. Oligonucleotides shown in blue take part in multi-step
ligation reactions templated by the green splint oligonucleotides to generate the full ligase
sequence. Following dilution, the splint oligonucleotides dissociate in the 48 °C ribozyme
reaction mixture, allowing folding of the ligase ribozyme. The functional ligase then ligates itself
to the 5ʹ-triphosphate oligonucleotide substrate. (b) Proposed secondary structure of ribozyme
ligase. Black letters represent ribonucleotides; red letters represent the 3ʹ-amino-2ʹ,3ʹdideoxyribonucleotides used in this study. The set of ligator oligonucleotides is shown inside the
box. The purple sequence is the 5ʹ-triphosphate substrate of the ribozyme ligase. (c) Left PAGE
shows the formation of RNA ligase ribozyme via non-enzymatic ligation. The reaction contains
20 μM primer, 25 μM each 2-methylimidazole activated oligonucleotide as shown in (b), 25 μM
each of the four different RNA template splints (5ʹ-AAGUGAUAAU-3ʹ, 5ʹ-CUUAUGUAAU-3ʹ,
5ʹ-UAAAGUGUUA-3ʹ and 5ʹ-CAACCUAUU-3ʹ), 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 50
mM MgCl2 and 100 mM HEI. The ligation reaction was carried out on ice. Right PAGE shows
the activity of the product ligase. The non-enzymatic ligation product was diluted 10-fold into
the ribozyme reaction buffer: 50 mM bis-tris propane, pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 3 μM
triphosphate substrate. The ligase reaction was performed at 48 °C.
