ABSTRACT

27

Hemagglutinin (HA) stability, or the pH at which the HA is activated to cause membrane fusion,

28

has been associated with the replicative fitness, pathogenicity, transmissibility, and interspecies

29

adaptation of influenza A viruses. Here, we investigated several mechanisms by which a

30

destabilizing HA mutation, Y17H (activation pH 6.0), may attenuate virus replication and

31

pathogenicity in DBA/2 mice, compared to wild-type (WT; activation pH 5.5). Extracellular lung

32

pH was measured to be near neutral (pH 6.9–7.5). WT and Y17H viruses had similar

33

environmental stability at pH 7.0; thus, extracellular inactivation was unlikely to attenuate Y17H

34

virus. The Y17H virus had accelerated single-step replication kinetics in MDCK, A549, and

35

Raw264.7 cells. The destabilizing mutation also increased early infectivity and type I interferon

36

(IFN) responses in mouse bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (DCs). In contrast, the HA-Y17H

37

mutation reduced multistep replication in murine airway mNEC and mTEC cultures and

38

attenuated virus replication, virus spread, severity of infection, and cellular infiltration in the

39

lungs of mice. Normalizing virus infection and weight loss in mice by inoculating them with

40

Y17H virus at a dose 500-fold higher than that of WT virus revealed that the destabilized mutant

41

virus triggered the upregulation of more host genes and increased type I IFN responses and

42

cytokine expression in DBA/2 mouse lungs. Overall, HA destabilization decreased virulence in

43

mice by boosting early infection in DCs, resulting in greater activation of antiviral responses,

44

including type I IFN. These studies reveal HA stability may regulate pathogenicity by

45

modulating IFN responses.

Importance

47

Diverse influenza A viruses circulate in wild aquatic birds, occasionally infecting farm animals.

48

Rarely, an avian- or swine-origin influenza virus adapts to humans and starts a pandemic.

49

Seasonal and many universal influenza vaccines target the HA surface protein, which is a key

50

component of pandemic influenza. Understanding HA properties needed for replication and

51

pathogenicity in mammals may guide response efforts to control influenza. Some antiviral drugs

52

and broadly reactive influenza vaccines that target the HA protein have suffered resistance due to

53

destabilizing HA mutations that do not compromise replicative fitness in cell culture. Here, we

54

show that despite not compromising fitness in standard cell cultures, a destabilizing H1N1 HA

55

stalk mutation greatly diminishes viral replication and pathogenicity in vivo by modulating type I

56

IFN responses. This encourages targeting the HA stalk with antiviral drugs and vaccines as well

57

as reevaluating previous candidates that were susceptible to destabilizing resistance mutations.

Introduction

61

Influenza A virus (IAV) isolates vary in fitness and pathogenicity because of differences in the

62

viral genetics and in the ability of the viruses to stimulate or evade host responses. In the H1–

63

H16 subtypes, the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein binds sialic acid–

64

terminating moieties on the host-cell plasma membrane (1, 2), is triggered by endosomal low pH

65

to undergo irreversible conformational changes that cause membrane fusion (3), and contributes

66

to virus assembly and morphology (4, 5). Genetic differences, between strains or due to

67

mutations, that alter fundamental properties of the HA protein can alter virus replication,

68

tropism, host range, and pathogenicity (reviewed in references (6, 7)). For example, isolates

69

containing an HA protein with a single Arg residue in its cleavage site are restricted to

70

replication in the lungs where extracellular proteases are available, while isolates encoding the

71

furin protease consensus sequence Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Argv undergo cleavage maturation

72

intracellularly in the secretory pathway, expanding tropism and increasing pathogenicity in

73

chickens and mammals (8, 9). Mutations in the HA receptor-binding pocket that switch

74

preferential binding from 2,3- to 2,6-linked sialic acid are necessary for avian influenza

75

viruses to adapt to humans (10-12). Two recent studies showed that a mutation that increases HA

76

stability (by decreasing the pH threshold at which the protein is activated) was necessary for

77

gain-of-function airborne transmissibility of H5-subtype viruses in ferrets (13, 14). A stable HA

78

protein was also necessary for airborne transmission of influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus in ferrets

79

and for pandemic potential in humans (15). Numerous mutations that alter HA stability are

80

located in the conserved stalk region (16), which is a target for antiviral drugs and broadly

81

immunogenic vaccines (17). Susceptibility to stalk-based antivirals and vaccines can be altered

82

by changes in HA stability (18, 19). In view of these facts, an understanding of how HA stability

83

regulates IAV replication and pathogenesis bears upon the emergence of pandemic influenza and

84

the development of HA-based control efforts.

85

During IAV entry into cells, receptor binding at the plasma membrane induces virion

86

internalization (20) via clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytosis (21, 22). Within 5 min,

87

internalized virions are exposed to a pH of 6.0–6.5 in early endosomes, and over a period of 30–

88

40 min or more they are exposed to pHs of 5.0–5.5 in late endosomes and 4.6–5.0 in lysosomes

89

(23, 24). At a threshold pH, HA trimers are triggered to undergo irreversible conformational

90

changes that cause membrane fusion (reviewed in reference (3)). The threshold pH for HA

91

activation (and subsequent inactivation) ranges from approximately 4.8 to 6.2 (16, 25, 26). In

92

general, avian IAVs have less stable HA proteins with higher activation pH values and human-

93

adapted IAVs have more stable HA proteins. Less stable avian-origin HA proteins can enable

94

virus replication in macrophages (27) and allow virus entry into early endosomes, thereby

95

avoiding virion interactions with the IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins that stimulate interferon

96

(IFN)-induced antiviral activity (28).

97

Dozens of mutations throughout the HA trimer have been identified as altering the HA-

98

activation pH, and many of these mutations are associated with adaptations (reviewed in

99

references (16, 29, 30)). Destabilizing mutations enhance virus replication in the presence of

100

ammonium chloride and high concentrations of amantadine, which raise the endosomal pH (31-

101

34). The replication of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus, which has an HA activation pH of 5.0–5.1 (26),

102

is enhanced in Vero cells by a destabilizing mutation that increases the activation pH by 0.2 pH

103

units (35). NS1-deleted vaccine candidates with HA-activation pH values of 5.5–5.8 have

104

infectivity and immunogenicity higher than those of related variants triggered at pH 6.0–6.3 (36,

105

37). In H5 viruses with relatively unstable HA proteins, stabilizing mutations have been shown

106

to increase upper respiratory tract replication in mice and ferrets (38-40) and to enable gain-of-

107

function transmissibility in ferrets (13, 14); however, these mutations decrease the replication,

108

virulence, and transmissibility in avian species (41-43).

109

Adaptations of IAVs to mice suggest that there is an optimal HA-activation pH range of

110

approximately 5.4–5.8 for replication in the lungs. In the context of 20th-century seasonal H1N1

111

and H3N2 viruses that are activated at pH 5.2–5.3, adaptation to mouse lungs yielded

112

destabilization mutants that elevated the HA-activation pH to 5.6–5.8 (44-46). However, the

113

adapted viruses also exhibited changes in receptor binding. For H5N1 and A/2009/H1N1 viruses

114

containing point mutations that did not alter receptor-binding specificity or avidity, HA proteins

115

that were activated at pH 5.4–5.5 boosted replication in mouse lungs and increased pathogenicity

116

when compared to those activated at pH 5.9–6.3 (15, 39).

The mechanisms by which HA stability regulates influenza virus replication,

117
118

pathogenesis, transmissibility, and host range are unclear. As viruses containing unstable HA

119

proteins (with activation pH > 5.8) have less environmental stability (41), we hypothesized that a

120

relatively stable HA protein was required for maximum in vivo infectivity and replication to

121

avoid extracellular inactivation in the respiratory tract (16). To test this hypothesis, we studied

122

infection with A/TN/1-560/2009 (H1N1), a 2009 pandemic virus, and two viruses with HA

123

stability–altering mutations (Y17H and R106K). The wild-type (WT) HA protein is activated at

124

pH 5.5, whereas a Y17H mutation in the HA1 fusion-peptide pocket increases the activation pH

125

to 6.0 and an R106K mutation in the HA2 coiled-coil core decreases the activation pH to 5.3

126

(15). Neither mutation altered HA protein expression, cleavage, maturation, receptor-binding

127

avidity, or receptor-binding specificity. Both mutant viruses exhibited multistep replication

128

kinetics similar to those of WT virus in MDCK cells; however, Y17H virus had reduced

129

replication and was less lethal than WT virus in mice (15). The objective of this study was to use

130

a mouse model to determine the mechanism by which HA stability regulates A/H1N1/2009

131

replication and pathogenicity.

Animal experiments

190

Seven-week-old DBA/2J mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with

191

virus in 30 µL of PBS. Clinical symptoms (including weight loss and mortality) were monitored

192

daily. To enable the collection of respiratory tissues, groups of mice were euthanized with CO2

193

after 2 and 5 days of infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected by washing

194

the lungs three times with 0.5 mL of PBS containing 2 mM EDTA (for a total volume of 1.5 mL)

195

via a catheter. The BALF was centrifuged, then the total number of infiltrating cells was counted

196

by flow cytometry and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Lung tissues were collected for

197

use in the various assays described below.

198
199

Virus titrations and environmental persistence assays

200

At 2 and 5 days post infection (DPI), mice were euthanized and nasal turbinates, tracheae, and

201

lungs were collected. After the tissues had been homogenized using a Qiagen Tissue Lyser II

202

(30/s frequency for 30s, operated twice), the homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at

203

8,000 RPM for 15 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf 5417R centrifuge. The infectivity of the

204

supernatants was titrated by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assays. One day before

205

the virus infection, 3–5 × 104 MDCK cells in culture medium were dispensed into each well of a

206

96-well tissue-culture plate and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. On the day of infection, tissue

207

supernatants were serially diluted 10-fold in virus infection medium supplemented with 1 µg/mL

208

L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Worthington Biochemical

209

Corporation, Lakewood, NJ). The plates were rinsed twice with PBS, and 200 µL of diluted

210

tissue supernatant sample was added to each well containing MDCK cells. The plates were

211

incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 days, then 50 µL of the culture from each well was

212

transferred to a new 96-well round-bottom plate, then 50 µL of 0.5% turkey red blood cells in

213

PBS was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The

214

highest dilution that tested positive for virus was recorded. TCID50 values were calculated using

215

the method of Reed and Muench (52).

216

To measure virus persistence, thawed virus stocks were diluted to approximately 106

217

TCID50 /mL in pH-adjusted PBS (pH 6.4 or 7.0). Viruses were incubated at 37 °C and collected

218

at the specified time points to measure the residual infectivity by TCID50 assay. The time

219

required for a 10-fold decrease in virus titer (Rt) was calculated by least-squares linear regression

220

of values above the limit of detection, using GraphPad Prism 7.

221
222

Lung pH measurements

223

A pH-1 micro fiber-optic pH transmitter and a pH-Microsensor (a needle-type fiber-optic

224

microsensor) were purchased from PreSens Precision Sensing GmbH (Regensburg, Germany).

225

The microsensor was calibrated manually according to the manufacturer’s manual

226

before experimental measurements. In brief, calibration details listed on the Final

227

Inspection Protocol of the microsensors, which were provided together with each

228

sensor, were typed into the pH1-View, Manual Calibration under Calibration. DBA/2J

229

mice were inoculated intranasally with 30 L of PBS or virus inoculum (750 or 375,000 PFU).

230

At 2 and 5 DPI, mice were euthanized, their chests were opened immediately, and the pH

231

Microsensor was inserted into their lungs. In each case, the pH was recorded 30 s after probe

232

insertion.

237

indicated temperatures (33 °C, 37 °C, or 39.5 °C) in 5% CO2 for 1 h, after which they were

238

rinsed three times with PBS. Infection medium was then added, and the cells were incubated at

239

the indicated temperatures (33 °C, 37 °C, or 39.5 °C) in 5% CO2. Supernatants were collected at

240

the indicated time points, stored at −80 °C, and titrated in MDCK cells by TCID50 assay. For

241

single-step growth-curve experiments, MDCK, A549, and Raw264.7 cells were infected with

242

virus at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell for 1 h at 37 °C, after which the infected cells were rinsed once

243

with saline buffer (pH 2.2) and twice with PBS. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2

244

until harvested at the specified time points. Samples were stored at −80 °C until they could be

245

titrated in MDCK cells by TCID50 assay.

247

Histopathology

248

The lungs from control and virus-infected mice were fixed via intratracheal infusion with and

249

then immersion in 10% buffered formalin solution. Tissues were paraffin embedded, sectioned,

250

and immunohistochemical labeling of viral antigen was completed by using a primary goat

251

polyclonal antibody (US Biological, Swampscott, MA) against influenza A, USSR (H1N1) at

252

1:1000 and a secondary biotinylated donkey anti-goat antibody (catalog number sc-2042; Santa

253

Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:200 on tissue sections subjected to antigen retrieval

254

for 30 minutes at 98°C. The extent of virus spread was quantified by first capturing digital

255

images of whole-lung sections stained for viral antigen by using an Aperio ScanScope XT Slide

256

Scanner (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA) then manually outlining fields with the alveolar areas

257

containing virus antigen-positive pneumocytes highlighted in red (defined as ACTIVE

258

infection). Those lesioned areas containing minimal or no antigen positive cells were

259

highlighted in yellow (defined as INACTIVE infection). The percentage of each lung field with

260

infection/lesions was calculated using the Aperio ImageScope software. In addition, a

Microarray analyses

273

Pieces of lung were preserved in RNAlater (Ambion), and lung tissues were homogenized using

274

a Qiagen Tissue Lyser II. RNA was extracted from lung samples with an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen),

275

and microarray analyses were performed by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and

276

Biotechnology at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Briefly, total RNA (100 ng) was

277

converted to biotin-labeled cRNA with an Ambion Wild-Type Expression Kit (Life

278

Technologies) and was hybridized to a Mouse Gene 2.0 ST GeneChip microarray (Affymetrix).

279

After the microarray was stained and washed, the array signals were normalized and transformed

280

into log2 transcript expression values with the robust multi-array average algorithm (Partek

281

Genomics Suite version 6.6). Differential expression was defined by applying a difference in

282

expression of 0.5-fold (log2 signal) between conditions. Lists of differentially expressed

Mini Kit (Qiagen). The levels of virus-specific vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA, as well as GAPDH

290

mRNA, were analyzed by semiquantitative real-time PCR analysis on an Applied Biosystems

291

7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) as previously described

292

(55). Briefly, total RNA was reverse transcribed using virus-specific RT primers or oligo-dT

293

primers and the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-

294

time quantitative PCR was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 system with QuantiTect

295

SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen) and the appropriate primers. After normalization of the

296

results to the GAPDH expression levels, the fold-change ratio of expression in virus-infected

Results

329

Y17H virus is attenuated for infectivity, replication, and virulence in mice

330

The HA protein of A/Tennessee/1-560/2009 (H1N1) WT virus was previously shown to be

331

activated for membrane fusion or, in the absence of target cells, inactivated by low-pH buffer at a

332

midpoint pH of 5.5. HA2 stalk mutations Y17H and R106K altered HA stability to pH 6.0 and

333

5.3, respectively, yet these mutated proteins retained similar expression levels, cleavage, and

334

receptor-binding specificity (15, 48). To investigate the mechanisms by which HA stability alters

335

infectivity and pathogenicity, we inoculated groups of DBA/2 mice intranasally with various

336

doses of reverse-genetics (r.g.) WT, Y17H, and R106K viruses. The mouse infectious dose 50

337

(MID50) of these viruses decreased with decreasing HA activation pH (Table 1); thus, increased

338

HA stability was associated with increased infectivity. WT virus had an MLD50 value of 11,000

339

PFU; the R106K mutation increased the MLD50 to 20,100 PFU; and 80% of Y17H virus–

340

infected mice survived infection with 375,000 PFU, the highest dose tested (Table 1). At

341

equivalent doses, WT and R106K viruses induced similar weight loss, whereas Y17H virus

342

caused substantially less weight loss (Figure 1A–C). For example, at a dose of 750 PFU, mice in

343

the WT- and R106K virus–infected groups exhibited approximately 10% weight loss, whereas

344

mice in the Y17H virus–infected group lost only approximately 2% of their weight. We

345

euthanized additional groups of mice at 2 and 5 DPI and measured the viral loads. WT and

346

R106K viruses yielded similar titers (P > 0.05) at all inoculated doses except for 750 PFU in

347

trachea at 2 DPI (Figure 1D-–I). As infection with R106K virus yielded viral loads and weight

348

loss similar to those observed with WT virus, R106K virus was excluded from subsequent

349

mechanistic studies. Titers of Y17H virus were only 10% of WT virus for many of the

350

inoculation doses used (Figure 1D–I). The maximal nasal titer of WT virus at 2 DPI was

351

approximately 105 TCID50/mL, whereas that of Y17H virus was lower by a factor of

352

approximately 100 (Figure 1D). At 2 DPI with a 750-PFU dose, WT virus reached its maximal

353

lung titer of approximately 106 TCID50/mL, whereas the corresponding lung titer of Y17H virus

354

was lower by a factor of approximately 200. Overall, these studies showed that the HA-

355

stabilizing mutation R106K had little effect on pathogenicity, whereas the HA-destabilizing

356

Y17H mutation was highly attenuating.

357
358

Reference and normalized inoculation doses of WT and Y17H viruses

359

For subsequent in vivo studies, we selected 750 PFU as the reference dose. This dose yielded a

360

10-fold difference in weight loss and 10- to 100-fold differences in lung viral titers (Figure 1),

361

and it had previously resulted in differences in histopathology, cellular infiltration, and

362

cytokine/chemokine expression (15). To normalize the viral titers and weight loss for subsequent

363

studies of host responses, we considered two additional groups. A 75-PFU inoculum of WT virus

364

resulted in an average lung viral titer that was lower by a factor of approximately 10 at 2 DPI

365

(P = 0.4731, non-significant) but 10-fold higher at 5 DPI (P = 0.0814, non-significant) (Figure

366

S1A) than the corresponding titer obtained with a 10-fold higher 750-PFU inoculum of Y17H

367

virus at those time points. With respect to weight loss, a 75-PFU dose of WT virus yielded a

368

maximum loss of approximately 9%, whereas a 750-PFU dose of Y17H virus caused

369

significantly less weight loss (P < 0.05 on days 7–10) (Figure S1C). Thus, a 75-PFU dose of WT

370

virus did not result in pathogenicity like that caused by a 10-fold higher 750-PFU dose of Y17H

371

virus. We next inoculated mice with a 500-fold higher dose (375,000 PFU) of Y17H virus and

372

compared the results to those in mice inoculated with 750 PFU of WT virus. These two groups of

373

mice exhibited similar weight loss (P > 0.05) (Figure S1D). Compared to a 750-PFU dose of WT

374

virus, a 375,000-PFU dose of Y17H virus resulted in lung titers approximately 0.5-log lower at 2

375

DPI (P = 0.2193) and approximately 1-log higher at 5 DPI (P = 0.0114) (Figure S1B). Overall,

376

the data showed that increasing the dose of Y17H virus to 375,000 PFU resulted in similar

377

weight loss and comparable, albeit unequal, lung viral titers to those seen with a dose of 750

378

PFU of WT virus. Thus, in addition to the groups of mice infected with 750 PFU of WT or

379

Y17H viruses, we included a group infected with 375,000 PFU of Y17H virus in our subsequent

380

analyses of potential differences in the host responses.

381
382

Y17H virus retains WT-like infectivity at the extracellular pH of murine lungs

383

One mechanism by which the HA-destabilizing Y17H mutation could attenuate virus growth in

384

vivo is by extracellular inactivation if the respiratory tract is mildly acidic (16). To measure the

385

extracellular pH in murine lungs, groups of mice were inoculated intranasally with WT virus

386

(750 PFU), Y17H virus (750 or 375,000 PFU), or PBS. In PBS-control mice, the average lung

387

pH was 7.04 (Figure 2A). The average lung pH in infected mice at 2 and 5 DPI was increased to

388

approximately 7.3–7.4 (P < 0.02 or less compared to PBS) for all groups except mice infected for

389

5 days with 750 PFU of Y17H virus, in which the lung pH recovered to 7.04. By 35 DPI, the

390

lung pH in all groups had recovered to approximately 7.0–7.1. Overall, this experiment showed

391

that the lungs of DBA/2 mice remain at a near-neutral pH whether they are uninfected, are

392

infected with a pH1N1 virus, or have recovered from an infection.

393

To measure the persistence of virion infectivity (environmental stability) at neutral pH,

394

we incubated aliquots of WT and Y17H viruses at 37 C in buffer of pH 7.0 or 6.4 and measured

395

the residual infectivity as a function of time by TCID50 assay (Figure 2B,C). At pH 7.0, the titers

396

of both viruses dropped from approximately 5.7 log10 to 1.7 log10 TCID50/mL over a period of 72

397

h. When virus aliquots were incubated at pH 6.4, the titer of Y17H virus decayed at an

398

accelerated rate compared to that of WT virus. The 90% reduction time (Rt value) is the time

399

required for a 90% (1 log10) decrease in the viral titer (56). At pH 7.0, the Rt values for the WT

400

and Y17H viruses were similar (21.7  1.5 h and 20.4  2.1 h, respectively); however, at pH 6.4,

401

the Rt values for the WT and Y17H viruses were 26.6  1.8 h and 7.4  0.6 h, respectively. In

402

summary, Y17H virions were inactivated at a rate 3.6 times faster than WT virions when

403

exposed to pH 6.4 but were inactivated at a similar rate to WT virions when exposed to pH 7.0.

404

As the measured pH of murine lungs did not drop below pH 7.0, a value at which the

405

environmental stability of Y17H virus showed little to no accelerated decay, we concluded that

406

the attenuation of Y17H virus in murine lungs was not due to extracellular inactivation.

407
408

Replication in cultured cells

409

We previously found that Y17H virus exhibited multistep replication kinetics like those of WT

410

virus in MDCK, A549, and normal human differentiated epithelial (NHBE) cells at 37 C (15).

411

Here, we performed additional single- and multistep growth-curve experiments. In MDCK cells

412

inoculated at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell and incubated at 33 or 39.5 C, Y17H virus grew in a

413

similar manner to WT virus (Figure 3A,B). Y17H and WT viruses also had similar replication

414

kinetics (multistep and single-step) in LA-4 murine lung adenoma epithelial cells (Figure 3C,F).

415

In differentiated murine nasal (mNEC) and tracheal (mTEC) epithelial cells grown at an air-

416

liquid interface, replication of Y17H virus was delayed by approximately 12–24 h (Figure 3E,F).

417

Additionally, the maximal growth of Y17H virus in mTEC cells was less than 10% of that in

418

MDCK cells. In Raw264.7 mouse macrophage cells, WT virus did not produce an infection,

419

whereas Y17H virus replicated (Figure 3I). For completeness, we performed single-step growth-

420

curve experiments using MDCK and A549 cells. Surprisingly, the data showed that the growth

421

of Y17H virus was enhanced relative to that of WT virus (Figure 3G,H). In summary, Y17H

422

virus replicated faster than WT virus in single-step growth-curve experiments in MDCK, A549,

423

and Raw264.7 cells; Y17H virus exhibited similar growth to WT virus in multistep growth-curve

424

experiments in MDCK, A549, and LA-4 cells; but the growth of Y17H virus was delayed in

425

comparison to that of WT virus in mNEC and mTEC cells.

426
427

Pathogenicity at equivalent and normalized doses

428

To investigate how the HA-destabilizing Y17H mutation affected in vivo spread and

429

pathogenesis, we inoculated groups of five mice intranasally with PBS, WT virus (750 PFU), or

430

Y17H virus (750 or 375,000 PFU) and recovered the lungs at 2 and 5 DPI. Compared to

431

infection with WT virus, infection with Y17H virus at the same dose (750 PFU) resulted in

432

significantly less spread of infection, growth of virus, severity of infection, cellular infiltration,

433

and IL6 and IP10 expression in the lungs (Figures 4 and S2). Thus, Y17H virus was highly

434

attenuated in vivo, recapitulating in vitro replication in mNECs and mTECs, the only

435

differentiated cells used for growth curves. We also wished to compare the results of a 750-PFU

436

infection with WT virus and a 375,000-PFU infection with Y17H virus, because in a previous

437

experiment, these two virus exposures induced similar weight loss and the viruses grew to

438

similar lung titers (Figure S1D). By 5 DPI, infection in the 375,000-PFU Y17H group covered

439

14% less area, grew to titers approximately 1 log higher, induced approximately 19% more

440

cellular infiltration, and was scored as approximately 17% more severe when compared to

441

infection in the 750-PFU WT group. However, the 750-PFU WT and 375,000-PFU Y17H groups

442

did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) at 2 DPI or 5 DPI with respect to virus growth, spread of

443

infection, severity of infection, cellular infiltration, and IL6 and IP10 expression in the lungs

444

(Figures 4 and S2). Thus, inoculating mice with Y17H virus at a dose 500-fold higher than that

445

used for WT virus induced an infection that was sufficiently robust to overcome the attenuation

446

of Y17H virus. This suggested that normalizing Y17H infection with a dose 500-fold higher than

447

the WT virus dose could be used to investigate differential triggering and/or counteracting of

448

antiviral host responses by the two viruses.

449
450

Impact of HA stability on antiviral responses

451

To analyze gene expression to examine if the Y17H virus differentially induces host responses,

452

we inoculated groups of three mice with PBS, WT virus (750 PFU), or Y17H virus (750 or

453

375,000 PFU). At 2 and 5 DPI, we collected lungs and processed the samples for Affymetrix

454

microarray analysis. At an equivalent dose of 750 PFU, infection with Y17H virus resulted in

455

21% fewer genes (127 vs. 161) being upregulated than with WT virus after 2 days and 54%

456

fewer genes (142 vs. 308) being upregulated after 5 days (Figure 5A). The upregulation of fewer

457

genes by infection with Y17H virus was consistent with prior experiments showing less virus

458

growth and cytokine expression with the attenuated virus (Figure 4). Despite mice in the

459

375,000-PFU Y17H group showing virus spread, infiltration, and cytokine expression in the

460

lungs that were similar to those in the 750-PFU WT group (Figure 4), inoculation with Y17H

461

virus at the normalized 375,000-PFU dose induced upregulation of 80% (289 vs. 161) and 104%

462

(629 vs. 308) more genes at 2 DPI and 5 DPI, respectively (Figure 5 B,C). Although this

463

suggested that Y17H virus might less effectively counteract host-cell antiviral responses, virus

464

dosage effects may also have contributed to the increased gene expression. Therefore, we

465

analyzed the number of shared and unique genes upregulated after infection with WT and Y17H

466

viruses. At 5 DPI, 90% of the genes upregulated in the 750-PFU WT group were also

467

upregulated in the 375,000-PFU Y17H group (Figure 5C). In contrast, only 44% of the genes

468

upregulated in the 375,000-PFU Y17H group were also upregulated in the 750-PFU WT group.

469

A total of 386 genes were uniquely upregulated in the Y17H virus–infected groups at 5 DPI,

470

whereas only 29 were uniquely upregulated in the WT virus–infected group. Thus, Y17H virus

471

appeared to trigger host-cell responses more robustly than did WT virus. Gene enrichment

472

analysis showed that the genes most differentially upregulated were involved in the IFN

473

pathway, the inflammatory response, and/or the antiviral state (Figure 5D). Transcription profiles

474

of genes in the IFN pathway were largely similar for the 750-PFU WT and 375,000-PFU Y17H

475

groups (Figure 5E).

476

To investigate further the effect of the HA-Y17H mutation on type I IFN signaling, we

477

performed Western blot analyses by using antibodies to STAT1, phosphorylated STAT1

478

(pSTAT1), influenza M1 (as a control for infectivity), and β-actin (Figure 6A). Comparing the

479

375,000-PFU Y17H and 750-PFU WT groups at 5 DPI, we found that pSTAT1 expression in the

480

Y17H group was 2-fold higher than in the WT group (Figure 6D), but both viruses had similar

481

M1 expression. Overall, Y17H virus induced the upregulation of more host genes and a higher

482

level of pSTAT1 responses in murine lungs than did WT virus when mice were inoculated with

483

Y17H at a dose 500-fold higher than that used for WT virus. The higher dose was necessary to

484

boost the growth of Y17H virus to a level comparable to that of WT virus.

485
486

Type I IFN responses are enhanced in Y17H virus–infected dendritic cells

487

Dendritic cells and macrophages recognize IAV and other pathogens via a subset of intracellular

488

receptors, such as Toll-like receptors 7/8 (TLR 7/8) and retinoic inducible gene (RIG)-I helicase,

489

and they release high levels of antiviral mediators such as type I IFN and other inflammatory

490

cytokines/chemokines(57). This process leads to more immune cells being recruited to the site of

491

the infection and to the initiation of an adaptive immune response. As the previous analyses of

492

type I IFN responses in murine lungs required a 500-fold higher dose of Y17H virus to normalize

493

the level of infection, we wished to investigate these responses to infection at an equal MOI in

494

the immune cells most likely to display potential differences.

protocols (47). After 6–7 days of differentiation, we infected cells with WT or Y17H virus at an

497

MOI of 3 PFU/cell. In macrophages, M1 expression was more than 3-fold higher in Y17H virus–

498

infected cells at 12–24 h post infection (Figure 6B,E), consistent with macrophages supporting

499

productive infection by Y17H virus but not WT virus in single-step growth-curve experiments

500

(Figure 3I). However, pSTAT1 expression in infected macrophages was similar for Y17H and

501

WT viruses between 6 and 24 h post infection (Figure 6E). In DCs, pSTAT1 responses were

502

highest at 12 h post infection, at which time pSTAT1 expression in Y17H virus–infected cells

503

was 3.3-fold higher than in WT virus–infected cells (Figure 6C,F). Thus, pSTAT1 expression in

504

DCs, but not in macrophages, was elevated by infection with Y17H virus, as compared to

505

infection with WT virus.

506

We also measured the induction of inflammatory mediators in bone marrow–derived DCs

507

and macrophages infected with WT and Y17H viruses at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell. Infection with

508

either virus resulted in increased expression of IFNβ, CXCL10, IL6, and TNFα at 24 h post

509

infection (Figure 7A–D). Compared to WT virus, Y17H virus induced 2.2-fold higher expression

510

of IFNβ (P < 0.0001) and 2.3-fold higher expression of CXCL10 (P <0.001) in DCs but not in

511

macrophages. In DCs, NP was expressed at a level 1.13-fold higher during Y17H virus infection

512

(P = 0.0313) at 4 h post infection (Figure 7H). At 6 and 12 h post infection, DCs infected with

513

Y17H virus also had higher levels of vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA transcripts than did DCs

514

infected with WT virus (Figure 7E–G). Overall, compared to WT virus, Y17H virus infected

515

DCs, transcribed viral genes, and translated viral proteins at higher levels early in infection,

516

resulting in increased induction of protective responses, including elevated expression of

517

pSTAT1 and the inflammatory mediators IFNβ and CXCL10.

To investigate if WT and Y17H viruses differentially induced Rig-I like receptors (RLR)

518
519

and TLR signaling, we infected bone marrow–derived DCs from WT, mice lacking the

520

mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), and mice lacking the two major adaptor

521

proteins MyD88 and TRIF. After 24 hours of infection, we collected supernatants and measured

522

induction of the cytokines IFN, IL6, and TNF (Figure 8). Consistent with previous results,

523

IFN expression was 32% higher in Y17H-infected BMDCs from WT mice than those infected

524

with WT virus (Figure 8A). MAVS is the adaptor protein required for retinoic acid-inducible

525

gene I (RIG-I)-mediated sensing of IAV RNA (58, 59). Bone marrow-derived DCs from mice

526

lacking MAVS were unable to produce IFNβ after infection with either virus, but these cells did

527

induce expression of IL6 and TNFα (Figure 8). The effects were similar for infection with both

528

WT and Y17H virus. These data confirm RIG-I-mediated sensing of IAV was required for

529

interferon signaling in DCs and that both viruses stimulate the RIG-I/MAVS pathway to trigger

530

the type I IFN response in DCs. In bone marrow-derived DCs from mice lacking MyD88 and

531

TRIF, IFN expression was reduced compared to IFN expression in DCs from WT mice. In

532

these cells, expression of IL6 and TNFα was eliminated, showing the MyD88/TRIF signaling

533

pathway was required to induce IL6 and TNFα inflammatory cytokines. Overall, the results

534

suggest that WT and Y17H are sensed by the same pathway in DCs and that the increased type I

535

IFN response observed during Y17H infection is due to increased replication by the mutant

536

virus.

Discussion

538

We have investigated several potential mechanisms by which a destabilizing mutation in the HA

539

protein might attenuate the replication of A/H1N1/2009 virus, reduce its infectivity (as

540

demonstrated by an increased ID50), and diminish its pathogenesis in mice. The extracellular pH

541

in the lungs of DBA/2 mice ranged from 6.9 to 7.5, a near-neutral range in which changes in HA

542

stability did not affect the persistence of A/H1N1/2009 infectivity. The HA stability altered the

543

virus tropism in cell culture. A destabilizing HA mutation boosted virus replication in single-step

544

growth-curve experiments in MDCK, A549, and Raw264.7 cells but reduced multistep

545

replication in murine airway mNEC and mTEC cultures. In DBA/2 mice, a destabilizing HA

546

mutation substantially reduced virus replication, virus spread in lungs, the severity of infection,

547

and cellular infiltration into BALF. Increasing the inoculation dose of the destabilized HA-Y17H

548

mutant virus 500-fold, as compared to the dose of WT virus, boosted the replication, pulmonary

549

spread, severity of infection, and cellular infiltration to levels comparable to those seen with WT

550

virus. Normalized infection with the destabilized mutant triggered the upregulation of more host

551

genes and increased type I IFN responses and cytokine expression in DBA/2 mouse lungs and

552

bone marrow–derived DCs. Collectively, the data show that HA destabilization attenuates

553

virulence in mice not by decreasing the extracellular virion stability but by enhancing early viral

554

transcription and translation in DCs, which results in stronger activation of antiviral responses,

555

including type I IFN.

556

Extracellular environments with acidic pH (pH <6.6), warmer temperature, and/or higher

557

salinity decrease the environmental persistence of IAVs (56, 60). Environmental stability can

558

also be decreased by destabilizing HA mutations (41), i.e., those that increase the pH at which

559

the HA protein becomes activated to undergo irreversible structural changes (16, 30). In the

560

present study, the A/H1N1/2009 virus containing a destabilizing HA-Y17H mutation (activation

561

pH: 6.0) had reduced environmental stability over 72 h at pH 6.4, but not at pH 7.0. From this,

562

we hypothesize that such a destabilizing HA mutation will attenuate influenza virus replication

563

in acidic environments but not at near-neutral pH. The respiratory pH in the lungs of DBA/2

564

mice ranged from 6.9 to 7.5. In previous work, the nasal pH and tracheal pH in mice were

565

reported to range from 6.5 to 7.0 and from 6.7 to 7.5, respectively (61-63). Therefore, we

566

conclude that extracellular inactivation is unlikely to be the cause of A/H1N1/2009-HA-Y17H

567

attenuation in mice. The HA-Y17H mutation may decrease the environmental persistence of

568

A/H1N1/2009 in the human nasal cavity, the pH of which is reported to range from 5.3 to 7.0 in

569

healthy adults and from 5.5 to 6.7 in healthy children (64-67).

570

The HA-Y17H mutation studied here increases the HA activation pH of A/H1N1/2009 to

571

pH 6.0, most likely enabling quicker virion entry into early endosomes. The wild-type HA

572

protein is activated at pH 5.5, most likely delaying virion entry until the progression into late

573

endosomes. Earlier entry by the Y17H mutant virus is consistent with the accelerated replication

574

kinetics of the virus in single-step growth-curve experiments in MDCK, A549, and Raw264.7

575

cells and bone marrow–derived DCs. Entry into early endosomes via a relatively unstable HA

576

protein such as HA-Y17H may also enable the virus to avoid functional interactions with IFTM2

577

and IFITM3 proteins in late endosomes. For reverse-genetics viruses containing the six internal

578

genes of A/H1N1/PR8 and two surface genes, less stable HA proteins from avian influenza

579

viruses were shown to confer increased infectivity in MDCK cells, and the viruses were less

580

sensitive to antiviral IFN responses (28). If these effects contribute to the increased pathogenicity

581

of H7 and H9 viruses in humans, as has been suggested (28), the effect may be lost for seasonal

582

IAVs. On the background of A/H1N1/2009, any early replication advantage by the less stable

583

HA-Y17H protein in single-step growth was lost during multistep replication in MDCK, mNEC,

584

and mTEC cells. In previous publications, destabilizing HA mutations have also resulted in

585

reduced virus growth in DBA/2 mice, ferrets, and human airway epithelium (15, 68). Although

586

the impact of HA destabilization on virulence in humans is unknown, the HA-Y17H mutation

587

was previously associated with a loss of pandemic potential in A/H1N1/2009 (15).

588

Wild-type A/TN/1-560/2009 (H1N1) virus with an activation pH of 5.5 was replication

589

incompetent in macrophages, whereas the destabilized Y17H mutant with an activation pH of 6.0

590

produced infectious virions. Similarly, the closely related virus A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) wild-type

591

(activation pH: 5.4) was replication incompetent in Raw264.7 cells, whereas a 7+1 reassortant

592

encoding a less stable H5 HA protein (pH 5.9) produced infectious virions (27). In the present

593

study, gain-of-function replication in macrophages did not correlate with altered antiviral IFN

594

responses or with increased virus replication and pathogenicity in mice. Thus, expanded tropism

595

does not necessarily result in gain-of-function pathogenicity.

596

Dendritic cells often elicit immunity by capturing and phagocytosing influenza-infected

597

airway cells (69, 70). Additionally, IAVs have been shown to directly infect primary human

598

myeloid DCs, human blood monocyte-derived DCs, mouse splenic DCs, and mouse bone

599

marrow–derived DCs (71-80), although these infections do not necessarily produce infectious

600

virions (80). A/H1N1/09 wild-type virus was previously shown to induce weak cytokine

601

responses in DCs but to be highly sensitive to the antiviral activities of IFNs (73). In the present

602

study, the destabilizing HA-Y17H mutation increased early infection and type I IFN responses in

603

mouse bone marrow–derived DCs, but not in macrophages, and amplified IFN responses in mice

604

were associated with attenuated virus replication and pathogenesis. Thus, the present work shows

605

that the destabilization of the A/H1N1/2009 HA protein to an activation pH of 6.0, a relatively

606

high value typically associated with avian influenza viruses, helps elicit stronger type I IFN

607

responses by accelerating infection in DCs.

608

We have discovered that HA stability influences IAV replication and pathogenesis in

609

mice by altering the virus infection kinetics and type I IFN responses in DCs. This provides a

610

link between a fundamental property of the viral surface glycoprotein, namely, acid-induced

611

activation of the HA protein, and the ability of the virus to evade antiviral host responses. Further

612

studies are needed to assess the impact of HA stability on the infection kinetics in DCs of other

613

IAV strains and the resulting antiviral responses, especially for highly pathogenic avian

614

influenza viruses that have HA proteins with relatively high activation pH values of similar to

615

the Y17H virus studied here. Future investigations should also investigate the impact of HA

616

stability on IFN responses in pigs, ferrets, and humans. In these studies, it will be important to

617

assess the relative importance of HA stabilization in dampening IFN responses, as has been

618

demonstrated in the present work by infection of DCs vis-a-vis HA stabilization potentially

619

increasing IFN responses by interactions with IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins in late endosomes

620

(28). Overall, we hypothesize that narrow ranges of HA activation pH support robust replication

621

by a particular IAV in a specific host. The restrictions on the HA activation pH should be

622

considered when developing antiviral drugs and vaccines, especially those that target the more

623

highly conserved stalk region. It should be noted that resistance mutations that alter HA stability

624

without reducing fitness in cell culture, such as the HA-Y17H mutation discussed here, may

625

greatly compromise virus replication in vivo. Thus, antiviral drug and broadly reactive vaccine

626

candidates that target the HA stalk but are susceptible to HA stability mutations in cell culture

627

should not be readily dismissed if such changes compromise the in vivo fitness of the virus.

ImageJ. In panel D, the results for the WT 750 PFU and Y17H 375,000 PFU groups from DBA/2

959

mouse lungs were normalized to WT expression at 5 DPI. In panels E and F, the results for WT

960

and Y17H virus infection (at equivalent MOIs in macrophages and dendritic cells) were

961

normalized to WT expression at 12 h post infection. Values for WT virus (black squares) and

962

Y17H virus (gray triangles) represents the mean (± SD) for a single gel in panel A and for two gels

963

in panels B and C. Significant differences, compared to WT, were determined by multiple Student's t-

964

tests: * P < 0.5, **P < 0.01.

Figure 2. Murine extracellular lung pH and virion environmental stability. (A) Lung pH values in
DBA/2 mice. Mice were inoculated intranasally with PBS (white), 750 PFU of WT virus (black), 750
PFU of Y17H virus (orange), or 375,000 PFU of Y17H virus (brown). After 2, 5, or 35 days of infection,
extracellular pH values were measured in the lungs. Reported values are means (n=6) with standard
deviations. (B,C) Environmental stabilities of WT and Y17H viruses. Virus stocks were thawed and
diluted to approximately 106 TCID50/mL in PBS with the pH adjusted to 7.0 (B) or 6.4 (C) then
incubated for the specified times at 37 °C before the residual infectivity was measured by TCID50 assay.
Groups included those infected with WT virus (black squares) or Y17H virus (orange triangles). For
panels B and C, the values are reported as means (n=3) with standard deviations. Statistical significance
tests compared the results to those for PBS (panel A) or WT virus (panels B,C): * P<0.05, ** P<0.01,

Figure 4. Infection, histopathology, infiltration, and cytokine induction in lungs. Groups of
mice were infected with 750 PFU of Y17H virus (orange bars), 750 PFU of WT virus (black
bars), or 375,000 PFU of Y17H virus (brown bars). After 2 and 5 days of infection, lungs were
recovered to assess the spread of infection, histopathology, cellular infiltration in BALF, and
cytokine expression in BALF. (A) Lung homogenates were plaque titrated by TCID50 assay on
MDCK cells. (B,C) Lungs were fixed, sectioned, and analyzed microscopically to determine the
percentage of cells infected (B) and the severity of the infection (C). (D) Cellular infiltration in
BALF was measured by flow cytometry. (E,F) Expression of IL6 (E) and IP10 (F) in BALF was
measured by ELISA. Undetectable values are labeled n.d. Displayed values are the mean (± SD)
from five mice per group. Multiple comparisons to the 750-PFU WT group at each time point
were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (time and group) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.
Statistical significance: * P<0.05, ** P<0.01, *** P<0.001, **** P<0.0001. ns = not significant
