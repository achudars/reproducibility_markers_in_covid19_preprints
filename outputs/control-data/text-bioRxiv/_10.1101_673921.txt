ABSTRACT

4

and solutes between coupled cells. Connexin 43 (Cx43), also known as Gap Junction

5

Protein Î±1, is the most broadly expressed gap junction protein in vertebrate development.

6

Cx43 is strongly expressed in premigratory cranial neural crest cells and is maintained

7

throughout the neural crest cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but its

8

function in these cells is not known. To this end, we have used a combination of in vivo

9

and ex vivo live imaging with confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and functional

10

assays to assess gap junction formation, and Cx43 function, in chick premigratory cranial

11

neural crest cells. Our results demonstrate that gap junctions exist between chick

12

premigratory and migratory cranial neural crest cells, with Cx43 depletion inhibiting the

13

function of gap junctions. While a reduction in Cx43 levels just prior to neural crest cell

14

EMT did not affect EMT and subsequent emigration of neural crest cells from the neural

15

tube, the size of the premigratory neural crest cell domain was decreased in the absence

16

of any changes in cell proliferation or death. Collectively, these data identify a role for

17

Cx43 within the chick premigratory cranial neural crest cell population prior to EMT and

18

migration.

INTRODUCTION

20

Connexins are integral building blocks of gap junctions (Li et al., 2002; Laird, 2014;

21

Sorgen et al., 2018), which are intercellular channels that permit diffusion of small (<1

22

kDa) molecules and ions between cells (Goodenough et al., 1996; Mese et al., 2007;

23

Abbaci et al., 2008; Defranco et al., 2008; Goodenough & Paul, 2009; Delmar et al.,

24

2018). Connexin proteins have four membrane spanning domains, two extracellular

25

loops, one intracellular loop, and intracellular amino and carboxyl termini (Mese et al.,

26

2007; Abbaci et al., 2008; Defranco et al., 2008; Delmar et al., 2018). Following their

27

synthesis, six connexin proteins are assembled into a hemichannel, also known as a

28

connexon, which can be either homomeric or heteromeric (Goodenough et al., 1996;

29

Mese et al., 2007; Abbaci et al., 2008; Defranco et al., 2008; Goodenough & Paul, 2009;

30

Delmar et al., 2018; Solan & Lampe, 2018). To form a gap junction, hemichannels are

31

trafficked

32

hemichannel/connexon on an adjacent cell, in a homomeric or heteromeric manner, with

33

the newly formed gap junction possessing a half-life of only a few hours (Mese et al.,

34

2007; Dbouk et al., 2009; Goodenough & Paul, 2009). Notably, the connexin composition

35

of gap junctions endows the gap junction with distinct properties including pore side,

36

voltage-dependent gating, open probability, and permeability (Vogel & Weingart, 2002;

37

Kanaporis et al., 2011). More recently, connexin proteins have been discovered to have

38

gap junction-independent roles, including binding and organizing cytoskeletal and

39

signaling components as well as regulating junctional conductance and voltage sensitivity

40

(Dbouk et al., 2009; Delmar et al., 2018; Sorgen et al., 2018). Not surprisingly, connexins

41

have been implicated in many human diseases involving a variety of tissues, including

cancer metastasis, although cancer preventative roles have also been ascribed to gap

43

junctions in certain tissue types, highlighting the dynamic nature of gap junction

44

interactions and function (Davy et al., 2006; Laird, 2014; Delmar et al., 2018; Cooreman

45

et al., 2019; Waning et al., 2019; J. I. Wu & Wang, 2019).

46

In humans, 21 connexins have been identified and there are at least 16 in mice (Li

47

et al., 2002; Laird, 2014) and, of these, Connexin 43 (Cx43) in the most abundant and

48

the best studied (Goodenough et al., 1996; Laird, 2014; Delmar et al., 2018; Sorgen et

49

al., 2018; J. I. Wu & Wang, 2019). Our recent work revealed that Cx43 is expressed in

50

chick cranial neural crest cells, including both prior to and during their epithelial-to-

51

mesenchymal transition (EMT), and their subsequent migration (Jourdeuil & Taneyhill,

52

2018). Neural crest cells are a multipotent cell population induced during early

53

embryogenesis within the neural plate border, a region between the neural and non-

54

neural ectoderm (Donoghue et al., 2008; Sauka-Spengler & Bronner-Fraser, 2008;

55

Gammill & Roffers-Agarwal, 2010; Bronner, 2012; Bronner & LeDouarin, 2012; Ivashkin

56

& Adameyko, 2013; Simoes-Costa & Bronner, 2013). During neurulation, premigratory

57

neural crest cells, which lie at the dorsal aspect of the neural folds, undergo EMT,

58

delaminate, and migrate into the periphery where they give rise to a large number of

59

derivatives including intramembranous bones, satellite glial cells, melanocytes, smooth

60

muscle, adipocytes, and odontoblasts (Sauka-Spengler & Bronner-Fraser, 2008;

61

Bronner, 2012; Bronner & LeDouarin, 2012; Ishii et al., 2012; Prasad et al., 2012;

62

Stuhlmiller & Garcia-Castro, 2012; Ivashkin & Adameyko, 2013; Simoes-Costa &

63

Bronner, 2013). While Cx43 (and gap junctions) has been identified in human, Xenopus,

64

and mouse migratory neural crest cells (Reaume et al., 1995; Ewart et al., 1997; Lo et

66

2006; Rhee et al., 2009; Francis et al., 2011; Kotini et al., 2018), the presence of functional

67

gap junctions in the premigratory cranial neural crest cell population, however, remains

68

unknown. Moreover, nearly 80 distinct mutations in Cx43 gives rise to a multisystem

69

developmental

70

characterized by defects in neural crest-derived craniofacial bones (William A. Paznekas

71

et al., 2003; W. A. Paznekas et al., 2009; Laird, 2014; Delmar et al., 2018). Gap junction-

72

related disorders of the peripheral nervous system have also been identified, which, in

73

the craniofacial region, are derived from neural crest and placode cells (Hamburger, 1961;

74

Delmar et al., 2018).

75

The robust expression of Cx43 in premigratory cranial neural crest cells, both

76

before and during EMT, suggests that gap junctions may exist within this cell population

77

to facilitate intercellular communication as these cells dismantle their adherens and tight

78

junctions during EMT (Sauka-Spengler & Bronner-Fraser, 2008; Bronner, 2012;

79

Schiffmacher et al., 2014; Schiffmacher et al., 2016; Schiffmacher et al., 2018). A recent

80

study in Xenopus cranial neural crest cells identified a 20 kDa isoform of Cx43 (Cx43-

81

20k) that trans-activates N-cadherin to promote NCC migration without affecting the

82

premigratory neural crest cell population or EMT (Kotini et al., 2018). In chick, however,

83

N-cadherin is extinguished very early within the premigratory cranial neural crest cell

84

population and is not expressed by migratory cranial neural crest cells until later in

85

development (Dady et al., 2012). To further explore a role for gap junctions and Cx43

86

within the cranial neural crest cell population of the chick, we performed live imaging and

87

loss-of-function assays. Our data reveal that functional gap junctions are formed between

88

premigratory and migratory neural crest cells. In addition, depletion of Cx43 is sufficient

89

to inhibit gap junction function in both premigratory and migratory neural crest cells, but

90

this does not overtly affect neural crest cell EMT and early migration. Instead, a reduction

91

in Cx43 resulted in a concomitant loss of Snail2- and Pax7-positive premigratory cranial

92

neural crest cells. Altogether, these data suggest that Cx43 plays a role in influencing the

93

size of the premigratory cranial neural crest cell population in the chick embryo, but,

94

remarkably, Cx43-dependent gap junctions are likely not required for neural crest cell

95

EMT, implying that role of Cx43, and gap junctions, may be unique to individual species.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

99

Chicken embryo culturing and fixation

100

Fertilized chicken eggs were obtained from both Moyerâs Chicks (Quakertown, PA,

101

USA) as well as the University of Maryland (College Park, MD, USA) and incubated at

102

38Â°C in humidified incubators (EggCartons.com, Manchaug, MA, USA). After 30 hours of

103

incubation, eggs were removed from the incubator and a window was made in the shell

104

to allow access to the embryo. Samples were staged according to the Hamburger and

105

Hamilton (Hamburger & Hamilton, 1951) staging table. Manipulations were performed

106

between Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 7+ through to HH8- (2-3 somite stage).

107

Embryos were subsequently collected between HH8- and HH10 (3-10 somite stage).

108
109

Cx43 and mismatch control morpholinos

110

A 3â lissamine-tagged antisense translation-blocking Cx43 morpholino (Cx43MO,

111

5â- CAGGGCACTCCAATCACCCATCTTC-3â), or a 5-base pair mismatch Cx43 control

112

morpholino

113

underlined and mismatches shown in lower case), was designed to target the Cx43

114

transcript according to the manufacturerâs criteria or serve as a control, respectively

115

(Gene Tools, LLC, Philomath, OR). Both morpholinos were used at a concentration of

116

500 ÂµM as previously described (Fishwick et al., 2012; Schiffmacher et al., 2014). We

117

confirmed that the morpholinos were specific to Cx43 and did not bind to any other sites

118

by using the NCBI Nucleotide BLAST tool to search the invert complement of the

119

morpholino

(Cx43MM,

recommendations). Immunoblotting was also performed to demonstrate evidence of

121

Cx43 knockdown (see below).

122
123

Dorsoventral electroporation of the neural crest

124

Dorsoventral electroporation of the neural tube was used to target the entire

125

midbrain premigratory cranial neural crest cell population between HH7+ and HH8-. To

126

this end, a drop of Ringers Solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Penicillin-Streptomycin

127

(10,000 U/mL; Gibco, 15140122) was applied to the vitelline membrane overlying the

128

embryo. A hole was then made at the edge of the area opaca using a 20-gauge needle.

129

The Cx43 MO or Cx43 control MO was injected between the vitelline membrane and the

130

embryo using fine glass needles to completely flood the area that will give rise to the

131

head. The electrodes were then placed such that the anode was inserted into the hole at

132

the border of the area opaca, underlying the morpholino-flooded epithelium, with the

133

cathode barely touching the vitelline membrane. Three, 9 V, 50 ms electric pulses were

134

applied with a 200 ms refractory period in between. Following electroporation, another

135

drop of Ringers with 0.1% Penicillin-Streptomycin was applied to the surface of the

136

vitelline membrane, the eggs were sealed with tape and parafilm, and re-incubated for

137

three hours. Embryos were then screened for the presence of Cx43 MO or Cx43 control

138

MO using a Zeiss Discovery v8 stereomicroscope, with successfully electroporated

139

embryos fixed using 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA; Fisher Scientific, 30525-89-4) at 4Â°C

140

overnight.

143

In ovo unilateral electroporations

144

Unilateral electroporation of the early chick neural tube was conducted to target

145

premigratory neural crest cells in the midbrain. The Cx43 MO or Cx43 control MO was

146

injected into the lumen of the neural tube of HH7+ and HH8- (2 or 3 somites) chick

147

embryos using fine glass needles. Electrodes were then placed on either side of the

148

midbrain and two, 25 V, 30 ms electric pulses were applied to the midbrain with a 200 ms

149

refractory period in between (Gemini System, BTX). Following electroporation, the eggs

150

were sealed with tape and parafilm, and returned to the incubator for three to six hours.

151

Embryos were then screened as described above and subsequently fixed using 4% PFA

152

or were processed for subsequent experimental analysis as outlined below.

153
154

Immunoblotting

155

To validate both Cx43 antibodies used in these experiments (Sigma Aldrich,

156

C6219, raised to the carboxy terminus (CT); Abcam, ab78055, raised to the amino

157

terminus (NT)), chick heads were collected from HH8 and 9 (5 somites through to 8

158

somites) wild-type embryos. Similarly, the knockdown efficiency of the Cx43 MO was

159

evaluated by collecting and independently pooling the electroporated and contralateral

160

control half neural tubes from the midbrains of Cx43 MO and Cx43 control MO embryos

161

at the 7 somite stage. Samples were rinsed in Ringerâs Solution, centrifuged at 500 g for

162

5 minutes at 4Â°C, and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein extraction and

163

immunoblotting were then performed as previously described (Schiffmacher et al., 2014;

164

Shah et al., 2017; Schiffmacher et al., 2018). Briefly, cell pellets were lysed in lysis buffer

165

(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1mM EDTA) supplemented

166

with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma, 1167498001) and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma

167

Aldrich, 10837091001) for 30 minutes at 4Â°C with periodic mixing. The clarified,

168

solubilized protein fractions were collected following centrifugation at maximum speed for

169

15 minutes at 4Â°C and protein concentrations were quantified by Bradford assay (Thermo

170

Fisher Scientific). Equivalent amounts of protein per sample were boiled at 99Â°C for five

171

minutes in 4X reducing Laemmli sample buffer and then centrifuged at maximum speed

172

for five minutes at room temperature. The samples were then loaded into a Novex

173

Wedgewell Tris-Glycine gel (either 16% (wild-type; XP00160BOX, Invitrogen) or 10%

174

(Cx43 MO and Cx43 control MO; XP00100BOX, Invitrogen)) and subsequently

175

transferred to a 0.45 Âµm BioTrace PVDF membrane (Pall, Port Washington, NY).

176

Membranes were incubated in blocking solution (5% dry milk in 1X PBS + 0.1% Tween-

177

20 (PTW)) for one hour at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4Â°C with

178

the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution: CT Cx43 (1:1000 (wild-type);

179

1:5000 (Cx43 MO and Cx43 mismatch MO)) or NT Cx43 (1:1000). Membranes were

180

washed in PTW and then incubated with species- and isotype-specific horseradish

181

peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (40 ng/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch) in

182

5% blocking solution for one hour at room temperature. Membranes were washed again

183

in PTW and antibody detection was performed using the Supersignal West Pico or Femto

184

chemiluminescent substrates (Thermo Scientific) and visualized using a ChemiDoc XRS

185

system (Bio-Rad). The immunoblots were then stripped using Restore Western Blot

186

Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific) for two hours at 37Â°C and re-probed using a Î²-actin

187

primary antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-46668) and its species- and

188

isotype-specific secondary antibody as described above. Immunoblots were analyzed

189

using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad), in order to determine band size and volume. The

190

volume of the Cx43 control MO- and Cx43 MO-electroporated (and their corresponding

191

contralateral controls) were then normalized to the loading control in order to determine

192

the efficacy of morpholino-mediated knockdown.

193
194

Evaluation of gap junction function

195

Gap junction function was evaluated by introducing either the Cx43 MO or Cx43

196

control MO via dorsoventral electroporation of the premigratory cranial neural crest cell

197

population as described. After three hours of incubation, the embryo, along with the

198

extraembryonic membranes, was dissected off the yolk and carefully washed in Ringerâs

199

Solution. The vitelline membrane was then removed and a ring of filter paper (VWR;

200

28310-128) was placed around the embryo so as to hold the embryo taut. A 1:1 solution

201

of 1 mg/ml Calcein (C481; dissolved in Ringerâs Solution), which only passes to cells via

202

gap junctions (Davy et al., 2006; Abbaci et al., 2008), and 1 mg/ml Dextran, Cascade

203

Blue (D1976; dissolved in ddH2O), to allow for the identification of the injected cells as it

204

does not pass through gap junctions (Ziambaras et al., 1998), was injected into the dorsal

205

neural folds using a fine glass needle. Excess Calcein-Dextran solution was washed away

206

using Ringerâs Solution. Then, the embryo and filter paper were turned over and the

207

tautness of the embryo and extraembryonic tissues were adjusted before a second ring

208

of filter paper was applied to the back of the embryo, creating a sandwich. The embryo

209

was then transferred, dorsal side down, onto a Glass Bottom Culture Dish (MatTek,

210

P35G-1.5-20-C) with a 20 mm Microwell and covered with a mixture of 1% Low Melting

Point Agarose (prepared with Ringerâs Solution; Promega, V2111) and thin albumin in

212

order to immobilize the embryo on the dish.

213

To assess the effects of Cx43 knockdown on migratory neural crest cells, embryos

214

were first unilaterally electroporated at HH7+ or HH8- with either the Cx43 MO or Cx43

215

mismatch MO and then cultured for an additional three hours at 38Â°C. The electroporated

216

embryos were dissected off the yolk and washed with Ringerâs Solution. The midbrain

217

dorsal neural folds (containing the premigratory neural crest cells) were then carefully

218

dissected from both the electroporated and the contralateral control side in PB-1 standard

219

medium and placed into either a Glass Bottom Culture Dish with a 10 mm Microwell

220

(MatTek, P35G-1.5-10-C (N=3)) or an 8-well Lab-Tek II Chamber Slide (Naige Nunc

222

coated with Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma Aldrich, P5899) and Fibronectin (Corning, 356008)

223

containing serum-free DMEM (Corning; 10-013-CV) supplemented with 0.1% Penicillin-

224

Streptomycin and N-2 supplement (Gibco, 17501-048). To each of these treatments

225

(Cx43 MO or Cx43 control MO), dissected wild-type neural folds that had been incubated

226

for 30 minutes at 37Â°C in a 1:500 Calcein-AM (Invitrogen, C3099)/DMEM (supplemented

227

with Penicillin-Streptomycin and N-2) solution in an uncoated chamber slide, and

228

subsequently washed three times with DMEM, were added. The neural folds were then

229

cultured overnight in order to allow the neural crest cells to undergo EMT and migrate out

230

onto the underlying fibronectin. Cultures were then checked hourly until the Cx43 MO- or

231

Cx43 control MO-treated neural crest cells made contact with the Calcein-AM-treated

232

neural crest cells.

All cultures were imaged live using a Zeiss LSM800 Confocal with AiryScan

RESULTS
Multiple isoforms of Cx43 are present in the chick cranial neural crest

282

A recent study revealed a role for a short C-terminal isoform of Cx43 (Cx43-20k)

283

during Xenopus cranial neural crest cell migration (Kotini et al., 2018). To define the Cx43

284

isoforms expressed in the chick head prior to and during neural crest cell EMT and

285

migration (HH8+ to HH9+ (5 somite stage (ss) to 8ss)), we performed immunoblotting for

286

Cx43 using an antibody that recognizes the Cx43 C-terminus. These results revealed that

287

only the full-length Cx43 isoform (37 kDa) is present in heads at both the 5ss, in the

288

premigratory neural crest cell population, and at the 6ss, when neural crest cells first

289

begin EMT (Fig. 1A). By the 7ss, when cranial neural crest cells are undergoing EMT, we

290

noted a strong band corresponding to Cx43-20k and a lighter band of approximately 11

291

kDa, the latter of which was also identified previously but does not regulate N-cadherin

292

expression (Kotini et al., 2018) (Fig. 1A). The expression of the 20 and 11 kDa isoforms

293

is also maintained at the 8ss (Fig. 1A). To confirm the identify of these bands, we

294

performed immunoblotting for Cx43 using an antibody raised to the Cx43 N-terminus,

295

which yielded a band of 37 kDa, corresponding to full-length Cx43 protein, and no C-

296

terminal isoforms (Fig. 1B). These data point to a potential role of full-length Cx43 in

297

premigratory neural crest cells and during early stages of neural crest cell EMT.

298
299

Premigratory and migratory cranial neural crest cells possess gap junctions that are

300

dependent upon Cx43 for their function

To evaluate whether premigratory cranial neural crest cells form functional gap

junctions, we examined the passive diffusion of Calcein dye, which only passes between

303

cells via gap junctions (Davy et al., 2006; Abbaci et al., 2008), between premigratory

304

neural crest cells in vivo containing the Cx43 control MO, which we validated by

305

immunoblotting to have levels of Cx43 similar to the unelectroporated, contralateral

306

control side of treated embryos (Fig. 1C, Cx43 MM EP vs. Cx43 MM CONT). In order to

307

trace the spread of the Calcein between cells that had previously been electroporated

308

with the Cx43 control MO, we co-injected a 1:1 solution of Calcein and Dextran, the latter

309

being unable to pass through gap junctions due to its large size and is thus maintained in

310

cells receiving the Calcein by injection (Ziambaras et al., 1998). Results of these

311

experiments demonstrated that, in under three hours, Calcein diffused to a small number

312

of surrounding premigratory neural crest cells (Fig. 2A-Aâââ, C-Câââ, E-Eâââ, G-Gâââ;

313

arrowheads indicate dye spread; Supplemental Video 1). In embryos possessing

314

premigratory cranial neural crest cells electroporated with the Cx43 MO, which leads to a

315

69% reduction in Cx43 protein levels by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C, Cx43 MO EP vs. Cx43

316

MO CONT; Fig. 1D), we noted no passage of Calcein to adjacent cells (Fig. 2B-Bâââ, D-

317

Dâââ, F-Fâââ, H-Hâââ; Supplemental Video 2). Taken together, these results demonstrate that

318

premigratory cranial neural crest cells form functional gap junctions and that Cx43

319

knockdown is sufficient to inhibit gap junction-based intercellular communication between

320

them.

321

To determine whether migratory cranial neural crest cells also form functional gap

322

junctions, we used an ex vivo culturing system to facilitate live imaging of dye passage,

323

or gap junction function, between neural crest cells. To this end, dorsal neural folds

324

(containing premigratory cranial neural crest cells) from either Cx43 control MO- or Cx43

325

MO-electroporated embryos were explanted into chamber slides and combined with

326

dorsal neural folds previously treated with Calcein-AM for 30 minutes (Fig. 3A and K).

327

After overnight incubation, during which time the neural folds attached to the dish and

328

neural crest cells commenced EMT and migrated, we observed that control MO-treated

329

migratory neural crest cells now possessed Calcein-AM within their cytoplasm due to their

330

contact with adjacent Calcein-treated neural crest cells (Fig. 3C, arrows). We confirmed

331

that these cells were, in fact, migratory neural crest cells by immunostaining fixed cultures

332

with the HNK-1 antibody (Fig. 3B-E). We then repeated the experiment but performed live

333

imaging at high magnification throughout the incubation period to observe dye transfer in

334

real time. Through these assays, we showed that when a control MO-containing migratory

335

neural crest cell extended a filopodia and made contact with an adjacent, Calcein-AM-

336

positive migratory neural crest cell, the dye was taken into the control MO-containing

337

neural crest cell in under four minutes (Fig. 3F-J, asterisk: Calcein contained within MO-

338

positive cell; Supplemental Video 3).

339

Next, we conducted the same fixed and live imaging assays described above but

340

this time with Cx43 MO-containing neural crest cells. When Calcein-AM-positive neural

341

folds were incubated with Cx43 MO-electroporated neural folds (Fig. 3K) and cultured to

342

generate migratory neural crest cells from both populations, we did not detect a single

343

cell in which dye transfer had occurred after immunostaining (Fig. 3L-O, arrowheads:

344

MO-positive cells, asterisks: Calcein-positive cells). We confirmed these findings with live

345

imaging, where we observed no dye transfer among Cx43 MO-containing neural crest

346

cells migrating among adjacent, Calcein-AM-positive migratory neural crest cells over a

347

period of five minutes of continuous imaging (Fig. 3P-T, asterisk: Calcein-positive cells;

348

Supplemental Video 4). These results demonstrate that migratory neural crest cells also

349

form gap junctions and that a reduction in Cx43 protein levels is sufficient to inhibit gap

350

junction function in this cell population. Intriguingly, as premigratory neural crest cells

351

were electroporated prior to EMT, these data also suggest that Cx43 knockdown is not

352

sufficient to inhibit EMT in an ex vivo culture system.

353
354

Cx43 knockdown reduces the size of the premigratory neural crest cell domain but does

355

not inhibit neural crest cell EMT in vivo

356

To delineate the function of Cx43, and potentially gap junctions, on EMT

357

independent of neural crest cell induction, we introduced the Cx43 control MO or Cx43

358

MO by unilateral electroporation at HH7+ to HH8-, three hours prior to the onset of EMT.

359

Embryos were fixed and immunostained for a battery of premigratory and migratory

360

neural crest cell markers (i.e., Cx43, Snail2, Sox10, Pax7, and E-cadherin) (Taneyhill et

361

al., 2007; Sauka-Spengler & Bronner-Fraser, 2008; Betancur et al., 2010; Murdoch et al.,

362

2012; Lee et al., 2013; Jourdeuil & Taneyhill, 2018). We also examined N-cadherin

363

expression as it is a marker for the neural tube at this stage (Dady et al., 2012; Lee et al.,

364

2013). When premigratory cranial neural crest cells were electroporated with the Cx43

365

control MO, we noted no change in any of the markers examined (Fig. 4A-Aââ, C-Cââ, E-

366

Eââ, G-Gââ, I-Iââ). As expected, electroporation of premigratory cranial neural crest cells with

367

the Cx43 MO reduced the levels of Cx43 in both the dorsal neural folds and the neural

368

tube (Fig. 4B-Bââ, arrow). Surprisingly, however, reduction in the level of Cx43 resulted in

369

a statistically significant decrease in the number of Pax7- (Fig. 4D-Dââ, arrow; p = 0.007)

370

and Snail2- (Fig. 4F-Fââ, arrow; p = 0.0001) positive premigratory neural crest cells on the

371

electroporated side compared to Cx43 control MO-electroporated premigratory neural

372

crest cells (Table 1; all values were normalized to the contralateral control side prior to

373

statistical analysis as per (Hutchins & Bronner, 2018)). Interestingly, the reduction in the

374

number of Sox10-positive premigratory neural crest cells (Fig. 4H-Hââ, arrow) was not

375

statistically significant (p = 0.2). In addition, we saw no appreciable difference in levels

376

and distribution of E-cadherin (not shown) and N-cadherin (compare Fig. 4I-Iââ to J-Jââ).

377

Importantly, this decreased domain size was not due to any changes in cell proliferation

378

or cell death. Immunostaining with an antibody to phospho-histone H3 (Fig. 5A-Bââ,

379

asterisks in Aâ and Bâ indicate the premigratory neural crest cell population) or TUNEL

380

assays (Fig. 5C-Dââ, asterisks in Câ and Dâ point to the premigratory neural crest cell

381

population) showed no appreciable difference in cell proliferation or cell death,

382

respectively, between control MO- and Cx43 MO-treated embryos. These results suggest

383

that the reduction in the size of the premigratory neural crest cell domain may be due to

384

an earlier effect on the cranial neural crest. Moreover, the absence of any change in the

385

migratory neural crest population (Fig. 4Dâ, Fâ, Hâ, arrowheads) reveals that Cx43

386

knockdown is not sufficient to inhibit EMT in vivo, in keeping with our ex vivo explant

387

culture data (Fig. 3).

388

Given this change in the number of premigratory neural crest cells upon Cx43

389

knockdown, we next evaluated the function of Cx43-mediated gap junction

390

communication in neural crest induction. To this end, we performed electroporations at

391

HH4 to target the Cx43 control MO or the Cx43 MO into the epithelium comprising the

392

non-neural ectoderm, neural plate border region (consisting of those cells that will give

393

rise to neural crest and placode cells), and the neural ectoderm. While the Cx43 control

394

MO-electroporated embryos developed normally, the Cx43 MO-electroporated embryos

395

displayed significant malformations such that it was impossible to characterize any effects

396

on neural crest induction (not shown). These data are not surprising as Cx43 is expressed

397

from very early stages of mouse embryogenesis (5.5 days post coitum) through to the

398

establishment of the neural crest (Yancey et al., 1992; Lo et al., 1997; Jourdeuil &

399

Taneyhill, 2018; Kotini et al., 2018) and is critical for a large number of developmental

400

processes. Altogether, these results indicate an important role for Cx43 during normal

401

chick morphogenetic movements and later in the establishment and/or maintenance of

402

the premigratory cranial neural crest cell domain. Moreover, premigratory cranial neural

403

crest cells do not require Cx43-dependent gap junction-mediated communication during

404

EMT and early migration.

DISCUSSION

420

Premigratory and migratory neural crest cells form functional gap junctions

421

Previous research has focused on the expression of Cx43 and gap junction

422

function in mouse cardiac neural crest cells, as Cx43 knockout (KO) mice die from

423

conotruncal heart malformations and defects associated with the outflow tract, a region

424

of the heart that forms from cardiac neural crest cells (Ruangvoravat & Lo, 1992; Ewart

425

et al., 1997; Lo et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1998; Sullivan et al., 1998; Xu et al., 2001; Wei

426

et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2006; Rhee et al., 2009; Francis et al., 2011). In mouse, Cx43 is

427

expressed in premigratory and migratory neural crest cells as well as those undergoing

428

EMT (Ruangvoravat & Lo, 1992; Lo et al., 1997). Furthermore, migratory neural crest

429

cells form function gap junctions (Lo et al., 1997). To further study Cx43 function, a

430

transgenic mouse overexpressing Cx43 (CMV43) (Ewart et al., 1997) or a dominant-

431

negative Cx43 fusion protein (Sullivan et al., 1998) were generated. Cardiac neural crest

432

cells in CMV43 mice possess an increased migration rate, with lower rates of migration

433

observed for cardiac neural crest cells from the Cx43 KO and dominant-negative Cx43

434

mouse (Huang et al., 1998). In Xenopus, Cx43 MO-mediated knockdown only impacted

435

neural crest migration, as none of the early premigratory neural crest markers were

436

affected (Kotini et al., 2018). In chick, we have shown that Cx43 is expressed in cranial

437

neural crest cells from HH8- through to HH17 during trigeminal ganglion assembly

438

(Jourdeuil & Taneyhill, 2018). In all of these systems, however, gap junction presence

439

and function in premigratory neural crest cells and those undergoing EMT remained

440

poorly understood, until our studies herein.

441

Our results now show that gap junctions are present in both chick premigratory

442

and migratory cranial neural crest cells and that their function is dependent on Cx43. An

443

approximate 70% reduction in Cx43 levels within the premigratory and migratory cranial

444

neural crest cell populations impeded dye transfer between adjacent neural crest cells. In

445

the presence of Cx43, dye will readily pass from one cranial neural crest cell to an

446

adjacent cell, but this is not observed upon Cx43 knockdown. The presence of Cx43-

447

mediated gap junctions in the neural crest could imply a function for gap junction-based

448

communication within the premigratory and migratory cranial neural crest cell populations,

449

which we investigated in more detail in the chick embryo.

450
451

Cx43 knockdown reduces the number of premigratory neural crest cells but does not

452

affect neural crest cell EMT

453

After determining that gap junctions were formed between premigratory and

454

migratory cranial neural crest cells, we next evaluated the function of Cx43 in the embryo

455

during neural crest cell EMT. Strikingly, unilateral electroporation of the Cx43 MO at HH7+

456

and HH8- (2-3ss) decreased the number of premigratory cranial neural crest cells but did

457

not affect EMT. In addition, this reduction in the number of premigratory cranial neural

458

crest cells was not due to increased apoptosis or decreased cell proliferation. This is

459

different from what was observed in Xenopus embryos, where Cx43 MO-mediated

460

reduction in the levels of Cx43 had no effect on the premigratory neural crest cell

461

population (Kotini et al., 2018). It should be noted that while a 70% reduction in Cx43

462

protein levels achieved by the Cx43 MO abrogated gap junction function (i.e., the ability

463

of neural crest cells to transfer dye), it is possible that any residual Cx43 protein may be

22

464

sufficient to mediate EMT. However, this would likely occur through a gap junction-

465

independent function of Cx43 given the robust loss of intercellular dye passage. In

466

addition, we cannot rule out that other connexins expressed in cranial neural crest cells

467

may be capable of compensating for this reduction in Cx43, or function normally to

468

mediate EMT by forming gap junctions. As the introduction of the Cx43 MO inhibited gap

469

junction function and also decreased the number of premigratory cranial neural crest

470

cells, it is possible that the normal function of Cx43-containing gap junctions is to permit

471

the passive diffusion of an intercellular signal(s) required to maintain this cell population.

472

A reduction in Cx43 could also affect hemichannel function, which allows small molecule

473

and ion exchange to occur between the cytoplasm and the extracellular environment and

474

has recently been shown to play a role in extracellular signaling and disease function

475

(Nielsen et al., 2012; Delmar et al., 2018; Rovegno & Saez, 2018; Valdebenito et al.,

476

2018). It will be necessary in the future to develop techniques in the chick that will allow

477

us to query hemichannel function in the cranial neural crest.

478

During the course of this study, we attempted to electroporate the presumptive

479

neural crest cell population prior to neural crest cell induction (HH4) with either the Cx43

480

control or Cx43 MO to evaluate effects on this earlier event. While Cx43 control MO-

481

electroporated embryos developed normally, the Cx43 MO had such a deleterious effect

482

on morphogenesis that it was impossible to determine whether Cx43-mediated gap

483

junctions are involved in neural crest induction (not shown). These data are not altogether

484

surprising as Cx43 is expressed in a large number of tissues, including the ectoderm,

485

neural crest, and neural tube; plays critical functions in intercellular communication,

486

cytoskeletal organization, and signaling; and connexin dysfunction is associated with

487

diseases that affect a variety of tissues and organs (Davy et al., 2006; Dbouk et al., 2009;

488

Kanaporis et al., 2011; Nielsen et al., 2012; Laird, 2014; Delmar et al., 2018; Jourdeuil &

489

Taneyhill, 2018; Rovegno & Saez, 2018; Sorgen et al., 2018; Valdebenito et al., 2018;

490

Cooreman et al., 2019; Waning et al., 2019; J. I. Wu & Wang, 2019). Therefore,

491

techniques in the chick to knockdown or knockout Cx43 function specifically in the

492

presumptive neural crest cell population at a well-defined time must be developed in order

493

to evaluate the requirement for Cx43, and Cx43-mediated gap junction function, in the

494

induction of cranial neural crest cells.

495
496

Cx43 and gap junctions may play different and species-dependent roles in the neural

497

crest

498

While we have identified the presence of Cx43-20k and Cx43-11k C-terminal

499

isoforms in chick cranial neural crest cells during neural crest cell EMT and early stages

500

of migration, their function at this time in the chick remains unknown. In Xenopus, MO-

501

mediated knockdown of full-length Cx43 worked in a cell autonomous manner that

502

specifically affected neural crest cell migration without interfering with neural crest cell

503

induction. Furthermore, the Cx43-20k isoform directly regulates N-cadherin transcription

504

in migratory neural crest cells through a BTF3/PolII complex (Kotini et al., 2018).

505

Interestingly, early studies to examine gap junction function in mouse migratory neural

506

crest cells ex vivo by Lo and colleagues noted that carboxyfluorescein dye-filled cells,

507

which had undergone gap junction coupling, expressed little to no N-cadherin at sites of

508

cell-cell contact, contrary to what they expected to see in emerging neural crest cells (Lo

509

et al., 1997). Subsequent investigation into the role of N-cadherin during mouse cardiac

510

neural crest cell migration revealed that N-cadherin is expressed at sites of cell-cell

511

contact found between extended cell processes. and that N-cadherin is often co-localized,

512

or closely apposed, to Cx43-positive gap junctions (Xu et al., 2001). Interestingly, while

513

N-cadherin deficiency also affected gap junction function in neural crest cells, Cx43 was

514

not downregulated (Xu et al., 2001), and, while N-cadherin appears to be required for

515

Cx43 localization to the cell membrane (Wei et al., 2005), Cx43 and N-cadherin appear

516

to have separable roles in cardiac neural crest cell migration (Xu et al., 2001). Additionally,

517

these studies do not suggest a role for Cx43 in N-cadherin transcription, highlighting the

518

diverse function of Cx43 in different species. As Cx43 interacts differently with N-cadherin

519

in both Xenopus and mouse neural crest cells, it is therefore likely that Cx43/N-cadherin

520

interactions may differ among species.

521

In the chick, N-cadherin is expressed in the neural tube but is absent in

522

premigratory neural crest cells prior to EMT (Hatta & Takeichi, 1986; Nakagawa &

523

Takeichi, 1998; Dady et al., 2012; Jourdeuil & Taneyhill, 2018). Moreover, if N-cadherin

524

is ectopically expressed in trunk premigratory neural crest cells, no neural crest cells

525

undergo EMT (Nakagawa & Takeichi, 1998). Migratory neural crest cells in the chick,

526

however, express Cadherin-7 (Nakagawa & Takeichi, 1998). Therefore, the function of

527

the Cx43-20k isoform during early neural crest cell migration in the chick remains to be

528

elucidated as does whether Cadherin-7 can interact with Cx43 in a manner similar to what

529

has been described for N-cadherin in mouse.

530

Remarkably, our study shows a significant reduction in the size of the premigratory

531

cranial neural crest cell population after Cx43 knockdown, which has not been described

532

in other species after loss of Cx43. The reduction in the size of the premigratory cranial

533

neural crest may be due to the loss of gap junction function or loss of a required gap

534

junction-independent function of Cx43. To unravel this, it will be necessary to target earlier

535

stages during the induction and specification of the neural crest; however, our attempts

536

were unsuccessful due to the apparent requirement for Cx43 in proper morphogenetic

537

movements during early chick development.

538

These data also suggest, however, that connexins (and potentially gap junctions),

539

may play different roles in neural crest cell induction, specification, EMT, and migration in

540

different species or different subpopulations of the neural crest (i.e., cardiac versus

541

cranial). As there is robust expression of full-length Cx43 at these stages in chick, and

542

reduction in Cx43 inhibits gap junction function, gap junctions may play a role in

543

coordinating cell-cell communication during the establishment of the neural crest cell

544

population. The function of Cx43-mediated gap junctions during neural crest cell migration

545

in chick is currently unknown and is an area of current study. During EMT, however, it is

546

likely that the function of Cx43 is gap junction-independent, possibly involving Cx43-

547

mediated cytoskeleton rearrangements as identified in mouse cardiac neural crest cells,

548

which will be followed up in a future study.

CONCLUSIONS

557

These data reveal that both premigratory and migratory cranial neural crest cells

558

possess functional gap junctions in chick and that the function of these gap junctions

559

depends, in part, on Cx43. Furthermore, reduction of Cx43 protein levels between HH7+

560

and HH8- decreases the number of Pax7- and Snail2-positive premigratory neural crest

561

cells but is insufficient to block EMT. This suggests that gap junctions may be needed to

562

maintain the size of the premigratory neural crest cell population but are not required for

563

EMT. As we are unable to achieve complete knockdown of Cx43, however, we cannot

564

determine whether residual Cx43 is serving a non-gap junction-related function and

565

therefore allowing EMT to progress normally. Further study will be required to determine

566

such a role for Cx43 during cranial neural crest cell EMT, as initial experiments to decipher

567

the function of Cx43 during early neural crest cell induction were not fruitful due to large-

568

scale developmental abnormalities occurring upon Cx43 knockdown at this stage.

569

Interestingly, we also identified multiple C-terminal isoforms of Cx43 (Cx43-20k and

570

Cx43-11k) in chick cranial neural crest cells during EMT and early migration. A recent

571

paper in Xenopus demonstrated that the Cx43-20k isoform is a transcriptional regulator

572

of N-cadherin, a gene required for neural crest migration in Xenopus. Chick cranial neural

573

crest cells do not require N-cadherin to mediate their early migration, however, suggesting

574

that connexins may play distinct roles in different species. Taken together, these data

575

suggest that connexins, and gap junctions, may be critical for intercellular communication

576

to maintain the appropriate size of the premigratory cranial neural crest cell domain prior

577

to these cells undergoing EMT and migrating to properly pattern the vertebrate embryo.

reveals different Connexin 43 isoforms during chick development. Immunoblotting

789

results shown for antibodies directed against the C-terminus (A, C) or N-terminus (B) of

790

Connexin 43 (Cx43). (A) The antibody directed against the C-terminus revealed the

791

presence of full-length Cx43 protein (37 kDa) at all stages examined (5-8ss), while the 20

792

kDa and 11 kDa Cx43 isoforms are only present at the 7ss and 8ss. (B) The antibody

793

directed against the N-terminus, which is distinct from the C-terminal epitope, does not

794

detect the 20 kDa or 11 kDa isoforms of Cx43. Knockdown efficiency of the Cx43 MO

795

was assessed as previously described (C. Y. Wu & Taneyhill, 2012; Shah et al., 2017).

796

Immunoblot analysis using the C-terminal antibody (C) reveals a 69% reduction (D) in

797

Cx43 protein (Cx43 MO EP) as compared to the control MO-treated lysate (Cx43 MM EP)

798

and associated contralateral controls (Cx43 MO CONT and Cx43 MM CONT).

dye (green) from Calcein-AM-treated wildtype (WT) neural crest cells to neural crest cells

812

treated with either the Cx43 mismatch control (MM) or Cx43 morpholino (MO). When

813

premigratory neural crest cells from MM-treated embryos were combined with Calcein-

814

AM-treated WT premigratory neural crest cells (A-J), passage of Calcein-AM occurred

815

between adjacent MM-positive neural crest cells, noted after fixation (B-E, arrowhead to

816

arrow-labeled cells) and in live cultures (F-J, asterisk). No dye, however, moved to Cx43

817

MO-positive neural crest cells (K-O, arrowhead) while adjacent WT neural crest cells

818

freely pass Calcein-AM (asterisk). This is more obvious during live imaging (P-T), where

819

a MO-positive neural crest cell migrates between two adjacent cells and there is no

820

transfer of Calcein-AM (asterisk). During live imaging, photos were acquired every 10

821

seconds (a total of 25 images were captured, but only the first five images are shown in

822

stills; videos can be viewed in supplemental data). Scale bars in (A) and (K) are 100 Âµm;

823

scale bars in (B-E) and (L-T) are 10 Âµm; and scale bars in (F-J) are 5 Âµm.

833

migratory neural crest cell markers (e.g., Pax7 (Câ), Snail2 (Eâ), Sox10 (Gâ)). Similarly,

834

there are no changes in N-cadherin (I-Iââ), a marker of neural tube cells. In Cx43 MO-

835

treated embryos (B-Bââ, D-Dââ, F-Fââ, H-Hââ, J-Jââ, L-Lââ, N-Nââ), however, there is obvious

836

knockdown of Cx43 in the neural tube (Bâ, arrow) and also a reduction in the premigratory

837

neural crest cell population observed after Pax7 (Dâ, arrow), Snail2 (Fâ, arrow), and Sox10

838

(Hâ, arrow) immunostaining. Interestingly, other markers such as N-cadherin (J-Jââ) and

839

E-cadherin (not shown) are not affected. Cx43 knockdown does not seem to be required

840

for EMT, as neural crest cells emerge from the neural tube (Dâ, Fâ, Hâ; arrowheads). Scale

841

bars are 20 Âµm.
