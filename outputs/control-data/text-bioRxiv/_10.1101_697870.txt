Abstract
Developmental dyslexia, a specific learning difficulty in reading, manifests as effortful decoding of
words and as such is commonly associated with reduced phonemic awareness. However, its underlying
cause remains elusive, with magnocellular visual processing, temporal auditory processing, visual
attentional deficits and cerebellar dysfunction all gaining some traction. More recent theories have
concerned visual attention span, measuring the parallel attentive capacity of the sensory visual system.
However the VA span task as implemented requires reports, both conscious recall and recognition of
letters, that activate many cortical areas beyond sensory visual cortex. Change detection, in contrast,
does not require the conscious recognition of items, but simply awareness that the stimulus has
changed, or not, again testing visual attention in a parallel fashion, but avoiding the complications of
higher order cognitive processes. Thus, we investigated change detection in 33 good and poor readers
with ages of around 10 yr, using a gap paradigm. Groups of 4 letters or 4 shapes were presented for a
fixed time (0.7 s), followed after a 0.25 s gap, by a second similar group, each item surrounded by an
annular frame filled with dynamic random noise of variable contrast. Detection performance was
manipulated by varying the contrast of these meta-contrast mask frames, yielding a threshold contrast
of the frames at which participants could just detect change. In two separate experiments, letters and
rectangular shapes were used as target items, in order to test whether previous findings of superior
change detection in good compared with poor readers was a result of greater automaticity in letter
recognition of the good readers. The results indicate that the good readers were able to detect change at
higher levels of masking distraction for both the letter and shape targets, indicating that this difference
is not specifically related to to the training of graphemic or lexical information but more likely reflects
a difference in alerting or pre-recognition stages of visual processing. Together, the results provide
further support of the notion that there is a low level attentional performance difference between
dyslexic and normal reading children. Thus, the results further bring transient spatial attention directly
into the spotlight as an ability critical for learning to read.

Introduction
Developmental Dyslexia (DD) is an impairment in the acquisition of literacy skills despite
normal intelligence, socioeconomic and educational circumstances, as defined under DSM-IV-TR
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000), but positioned with specific learning disorder in DSM-5
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). It is estimated to affect approximately 5-10% of school-aged
children (Habib, 2000). These deficits tend to persist through to adulthood. Children with DD are
reported to show deficits in many areas of perception, motor skills and learning but the primary deficit
has long been considered to involve phonological processing (reviewed Bishop and Snowling (2004),
Snowling and Hulme (2012)). Deficits in rapid temporal auditory processing have also been
hypothesised as the basis of dyslexia by Merzenich et al. (1996), as dyslexics have difficulty in rapidly
processing sequential information. Indeed, rapid temporal dot counting has been shown to be more
difficult for children with dyslexia than spatial dot counting (Eden et al., 1995). Other multisensory
processing deficits have been demonstrated with both auditory and visual gap detection impaired in
children with dyslexia compared with normal reading children of the same age (Van Ingelghem et al.,
2001) indicate the possibility of a general temporal processing deficit in children with dyslexia. More
recent experiments employing stimuli designed to probe magnocellular activity have also identified
perceptual speed as a common factor accounting for variance in reading ability (McLean et al., 2011).
Competing visual hypotheses also exist for the underlying mechanism of dyslexia. For example,
dysfunction in the magnocellular visual pathway (Stein and Walsh, 1997;Habib, 2000;Gori et al., 2016)
has been proposed on the basis of reduced motion and motion coherence sensitivity (Cornelissen et al.,
1995;Talcott et al., 2000), and reduced brain activation in Area V5/MT+ (Eden et al., 1996) to moving
stimuli with Demb et al. (1998) showing a 3-way interaction between brain activiation in MT+,
thresholds for speed discrimination and reading speed.
Interest has also grown in abnormalities in transient attention as a basis for autistic perception.
Indeed deficiencies in visual attention as the basis for dyslexia are supported by reports of slower serial
search speeds and lowered search performance (Eskenazi and Diamond, 1983;Casco and Prunetti,
1996). Early work investigating the effect of backward masking (Grosser and Trzeciak, 1981) on the
recognition of briefly presented single letters, demonstrated poorer performance in a group of dyslexic
children compared with normals. Facoetti and Molteni (2001) showed that dyslexia is associated with
an alteration in the gradient of attention with consequent abnormalities in engagement and
disengagament (Facoetti et al., 2008). Visual attention span (VA) was introduced as a means of
measuring the proportion of distinct visual elements that can be correctly processed in parallel in a
briefly presented multi-element array (Bosse et al., 2007). Bosse et al. proposed that a deficit in VA

span might contribute to developmental dyslexia, independently of abnormalities in phonological
processing. This was supported through studies indicating a visual rather than verbal modality (Lobier
et al., 2012). Also, fMRI studies using categorization of alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric character
strings showed differential fMRI activation in the superior parietal lobule between participants with
and without dyslexia (Lobier et al., 2014).
Other aspects of attentional processing, such as ability to detect change in the environment
rapidly (change detection), have received relatively less attention, despite strong intergroup
differences. Rutkowski et al. (2003) using a gap-paradigm change detection task, involving a stimulus
array of 4 letters in circular place holders, showed that a much longer presentation time (an inspection
time) for the initial group of letters was needed in order to just detect change, comparing dyslexic
children with normal readers. There are some similarities between change detection and visual
attention span, centred around the fact that for both tasks, several objects have to be processed in
parallel. A key difference is that with change detection, the target objects do not have to be brought
fully to conscious awareness in order to report change at better than chance level. VA span, on the
other hand, requires identification and hence conscious perception of the objects. While change
detection relies on the integration of the initial items in terms of depth of recognition, it is possible that
the ability to detect change depends on low level attentional functions related to the sudden
reappearance of the second group of items following the gap. If misdirection of attention provided by
the place-holders around each object provides a masking signal, then this can potentially be used to
measure change detection ability, independent of integration times for recognition of the initial display
in the gap paradigm stmuli but rather as a function of ability to filter salient information by inhibiting
distracting visual stimuli.
Thus we proposed to further investigate masking as a distracter in change detection, providing a novel
thresholding mechanism using dynamic random noise of variable contrast in annular place holders as a
variable meta-contrast masking of the second presentation stimulus of the gap change detection
paradigm. This method of measuring change detection sensitivity (Rutkowski et al., 2003) was then
used across letter and shape targets to establish whether previously reported change detection
differences could be more attributable to better training in letter recognition in good readers rather than
impairment in visual processing in those with dyslexia. The shape stimuli were used to test whether
good readers, when presented with novel, untrained stimuli under similar task conditions, would
perform any better than poor readers.

Methods
Participants
Thirty-three children were recruited from two non-selective state primary schools and from a
summer camp for children with learning difficulties. Reading ability was assessed by trained
experimenters using the The Neale Analysis of Reading Test (Neale, 1999). A reading age was
established for each participant on the basis of the published norms. Assignment of participants to
good and poor reading groups was on the basis of chronological age minus reading age
Two similar change detection tasks were carried out – one using detection of changes in letter
identity (Expt 1a) and the other using change in orientation or colour of rectangular shapes (Expt 1b).
Delay in the implementation of testing for Expt 1b resulted in overlapping but not identical populations
for the two experiments.

Change Detection for Letter Stimuli
In this experiment, a fixation cross appeared for a period of 1 sec, prior to the appearance of the first
stimulus, which consisted of four upper case letters , each subtending a visual angle of 1° high x 0.8°
wide and presented at an eccentricity of 2° for a participant seated 57 cm from the computer monitor
(see Figure 1a). The presentation time for the first stimulus was fixed at 0.7 sec, followed by a fixed
gap of 0.25 sec (with only the fixation cross showing). The second display was as for the first display
(with a probablity of 50% that one item was changed), except that each letter was surrounded by an
annulus of width 0.2 subtending 2° at the eye filled with dynamic random noise (2 pixel), the contrast
of which could be varied from 0 to 1. The second stimulus remained on screen until a button was
pressed. Stimuli were created and presented using VPixx (www.vpixx.com) on an iMac computer (see
Fig 1a). Participants were required (in a two alternative forced choice) to press the keyboard right
arrow if they thought change had occurred and keyboard left arrow if they thought the two displays
were identical. Convergence to threshold for the dynamic random dot noise was under the control of a
PEST model. Participants performed 40 trials.

Figure 1: Experimental stimuli used in experimentas 1a and 1b. Both employed annular place holders
around the 4 stimuli of the second presentation, with variable contrast random dynamic noise (shown at
high contrast for the letter stimuli in Fig 1a, and low contrast in the shape stimuli for Fig 1b).
Change Detection for Shape Stimuli
The shape experiment was identical to the letter experiment, except that shapes were substituted for
letters. The shapes were rectangles oriented either horizontally or vertically and coloured either red or
blue (see Fig. 1b). With 50% probability one of the shapes could change its orientation, its colour, or
both, with conditions randomised. The shapes subtended 1° x 0.5° while the circular place holders
subtended 2° at the eye of the participant seated 57 cm from the computer monitor. Stimuli were
created and presented using VPixx on an iMac computer. Background luminance for both experiments
was 50 cd/m2.
Results
Letters
Good readers performed signficantly better than poor readers on the change detection for letters task.
This can be seen in Figure 2 which shows the mean threshold contrast (with standard errors) for the
masking annuli. As the contrast of the flickering mask increases it becomes harder to detect change,

and hence the contrast threshold represents a measure of change detection ability. Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was carried out on the threshold masking contrast compared between reading groups,
finding a significant main effect of Reading Group (F(1, 29) = 8.35, p = 0.007).

Figure 2: Threshold masking contrasts for letter and shape stimuli, for which groups of good and poor
readers (GR, PR) could just detect change. The data are presented as means (with standard errors).
Contrast thresholds for both letter and shape stimuli were higher for Good cf Poor reader groups.
Experiment 1b: Shapes
Good readers performed better than Poor readers on the change detection for shapes as well (see Figure
2). Again, higher contrast indicates a better ability to withstand the distraction caused by the
appearance of the rings. Despite the smaller population size of Poor readers in the Shapes experiment,
the effect of reading group was again significant F(1, 22) = 5.75, p = 0.02).
The similarity in threshold results for the two tasks suggests the degree of correlation be investigated.
Taken across all readers, the correlation between threholds for letters and shapes was significant
(F(1,20) = 4.77, p=.04, Rsq=.19).
Discussion
The results of these psychophysical experiments validate the use of variable masking as a measure of
change detection, as the results replicate those established using different methods of measurement
(titrating the initial display presentation time to estimate detection threshold) (Rutkowski et al., 2003).
The results of this experiment reinforce the idea (Rutkowski et al., 2003) that the sudden appearance of
the second stimulus is likely to be the factor that controls change blindness, for this type (display – gap
– display) of change experiment.
The metacontrast masking method has the advantage that it opens up other possibilities for
investigating the role of attention in change detection, particularly as it applies to the mechanisms of
dyslexia. It has the benefit that a wide dynamic range of distraction is available – especially using the

random dot noise which is qualitatively much more effective at high contrast than a static noise ring of
the same geometrical dimensions and contrast. The fact that mask contrast can be used in such a
controllable fashion to modify detection rate also suggests that the sudden appearance of the second
stimulus (see Fig.1) may interfere with change detection precisely because attention is distributed
across the field of possible targets. Indeed it would fit with better change detection for targets in upper
visual field compared with targets in lower visual field (Rutkowski et al., 2003), in the following way.
Primates including human appear to have a relative magnocellular concentration in lower compared
with uper visual field (Previc, 1990;Pitzalis et al., 2012) in extrastriate cortical areas. This lower field
bias for M cell activity has also been recently shown in multifocal VEP in children (Crewther et al.,
2019). This bias, together with the contribution of M cells to transient attention make it likely that
distraction from the flickering meta-contrast masks is likely to be stronger in lower visual field. This
would cohere with the upper visual field change detection advantage seen with change detection stimuli
surrounded by masks (Rutkowski et al., 2003).
A criticism of the interpretation of studies in dyslexia that use letters as stimuli is that letter processing
by poor readers may be deficient because they have generally read less and practised letter recognition
less. The discussion on both sides is well represented in Nature Reviews Neuroscience (Goswami,
2015b;a;Lobier and Valdois, 2015). This potential criticism provides the rationale for examining
change detection using shapes. The second experiment, despite being less statistically powered, due to
a smaller PR population, showed that when geometrical shapes were used as targets, change detection
performance was still inferior for poor readers compared with good readers.
The significance of the difference in change detection between good fluent and poor nonfluent readers
suggests that rapidity of object processing might play an important role in the development of fluent
reading (see (Grosser and Trzeciak, 1981), irrespective of need for phonological awareness of various
letters and words. This is borne out by recent experiments associating perceptual speed with reading
ability (Hecht et al., 2004;Thomson et al., 2006;McLean et al., 2011). The current findings are hard to
reconcile with Goswami (2015a) because while letters may have been learned better by those with
good reading skills, the spatial arrangement of the change detection task is something that has not been
trained, and yet the change detection performance on the shapes task was similarly impaired in those
with poor reading skills. More likely as an an explanation is that the good readers exhibit better
attentional control over low-level noise and distraction, irrespective of the targets.
