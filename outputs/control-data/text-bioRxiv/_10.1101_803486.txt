INTRODUCTION
Bacterial spores are highly resistant structures in a dormant state,
with little, if any, detectable metabolic activity (McKenney et al.
2013) (Figure 1). Spores are formed in response to adverse environmental conditions and spore formation, or sporulation, generally
occurs when bacteria are challenged by nutritional stress (Driks
2002; Errington 2003; Piggot and Hilbert 2004). Spores can remain
alive for extended periods of time and possess the ability to reactivate if nutrients become available and conditions are favorable
(Moir 2003; Setlow 2003; Paredes-Sabja et al. 2011). Spores can
survive many conditions that would otherwise destroy vegetative

cells. The unique architecture of spores, such as the spore coat,
cortex, and core, explains in large part their resistance to stresses
and their ability to survive under extreme conditions (Henriques
and Moran 2007).
Firmicutes are characterized by their ability to produce endospores (Figure 2-6), and compared to other spore-forms endospores are many times more resistant to oxidizing agents, heat,
desiccation, and radiation (Setlow 1995). Pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic
acid, or dipicolinic acid (DPA) is an important component of bacterial endospores (Powell 1953). It has been shown that DPA is
located in the spore core, and can represent 5–14% of endospore dry
weight (Murrell 1969). DPA is maintained within intact endospores,
and can be degraded under aerobic (Arima and Kobayashi 1962;
Taylor and Amador 1988; Amador and Taylor 1990) and anaerobic
(Seyfried and Schink 1990) conditions after it is released during
spore germination. Dipicolinic acid forms a complex with calcium

ions within the endospore core. This complex binds free water
molecules causing dehydration of the spore. As a result, the heat
resistance of macromolecules within the core increases (Gerhardt
1989). In addition, the calcium-dipicolinic acid complex also functions to protect DNA from heat denaturation by inserting itself
between the nucleobases, thereby increasing the stability of DNA
(Moeller et al. 2014).
In Bacilli, the DPA biosynthetic pathway has been well characterized (Wolska et al. 2007). In B. subtilis, the DPA synthetic pathway is encoded by four operons: dapG, asd, dapA and dpaAB. Asparatate kinase, encoded by dapG, is responsible for the first step of
the biosynthesis cascade, producing L-4-aspartyl phosphate from
L-aspartate. Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, encoded by
asd, is responsible for the second step, producing L-aspartate 4semialdehyde. Dihydrodipicolinate synthase, encoded by dapA is
responsible for the third step, producing L-2,3-dihydrodipicolinate
(Takahashi et al. 2015). These steps are also used in lysine biosynthesis. DPA synthase which is responsible for the production of
DPA, is encoded by dpaAB. Dipicolinate synthase subunit A (dpaA,
otherwise known as spoVFA) encodes a putative dehydrogenase,
and dipicolinate synthase subunit B (dpaB, otherwise known as
spoVFB) appears to be a flavoprotein (Daniel and Errington 1993).
The major genera identified as endospore forming bacteria include Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Clostridium (Fritze 2004; Logan
and Halket 2011; Galperin 2013). Since 1990, the genus Bacillus has
been split into several families and genera of endospore-forming
bacteria based on 16S rRNA analysis (Galperin 2013). The unifying
characteristic of these bacteria is that they are Gram-positive, form
endospores, and aerobic. An increased concentration of DPA is
a biochemical hallmark for endosporulating bacteria such as B.
subtilis (Piggot and Hilbert 2004). We therefore hypothesized that
strains capable of sporulating and previously classified as Bacillus,
such as Brevibacillus, Fontibacillus, Lysinibacillus, Rummeliibacillus,
and Terribacillus should produce DPA and contain the same set of
genes responsible for DPA synthesis in Bacilli.
Work by others has shown that members of the Clostridium sensu
stricto (cluster I) lack genes with significant homology to dpaAB
(Stragier 2002; Onyenwoke et al. 2004) but nevertheless produce
DPA during sporulation (Paredes-Sabja et al. 2008). This cluster is
particularly important due to the presence of industrially useful

strains such as Clostridium acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii, as well
as human pathogens such as C. perfringens, C. botulinum and C.
tetani. Osburn et al. (2010) implicated an electron transfer flavoprotein α-chain (etfA) that is directly involved in DPA synthesis in C.
perfringens using a modified version of the Bach and Gilvarg assay
system (Bach and Gilvarg 1966; Orsburn et al. 2010). We hypothesized that other members of the Clostridium (cluster I) such as C.
beijerinckii, C. carboxidivorans, C. scatologenes, and C. tyrobutyricum,
use the same or similar biosynthesis pathways.
DPA can be detected by a range of analytical techniques (Beverly et al. 1996; Yilmaz et al. 2010; Cowcher et al. 2013; Wang et al.
2011). The terbium dipicolinate fluorescence method (Rosen et al.
1997; Hindle and Hall 1999) is both tractable and sensitive, allowing the detection of nanomolar concentrations. This technique
is therefore appropriate for testing if the genera hypothesized to
produce DPA (Brevibacillus, Fontibacillus, Lysinibacillus, Rummeliibacillus, and Terribacillus) do in fact have the capacity for DPAproduction. The terbium dipicolinate fluorescence method can
also be used to establish that Clostridia such as C. beijerinckii, C.
carboxidivorans, C. scatologenes, and C. tyrobutyricum produce DPA
prior to sequencing and genomic evaluation to look for dpaAB and
etfA DPA biosynthesis gene homologues.
In the present study, bacteria isolated from soil and a microbial product were taxonomically identified using 16S rRNA sequence analyses. Presumptive endospore-forming bacteria were
then screened for DPA production in vitro. DPA detection was
followed by whole genome-sequencing to confirm taxonomic identifications at the species-level and to examine whether known DPA
biosynthesis pathways were present.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strain Isolation and Initial Identification
All strains used were isolated from either bulk soil or from a sample of HYT® A (Table S1) (Agrinos, https://agrinos.com). Strains
were then repeatedly streaked onto semi-solid media until isogenic. Initial taxonomic classifications were made using 16S
rRNA gene sequences. Full length 16S genes were amplified
from each strain using genomic DNA and/or colonies as the
PCR template (27F, 5’-AGRGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’; 1492R,
5’-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3’; following (Singer et al. 2016)
with minor modifications). PCR products were sequenced directly

(Madden 2013).

Prior to testing, strains were grown as follows. Aerobic strains
were cultured on Trypticase Soy Agar (i.e. TSA; Tryptone 17 g/L,
Soytone 3 g/L, Dextrose 2.5 g/L, Sodium chloride 5 g/L, Dipotassium phosphate 2.5 g/L, Agar 15 g/L) in a static incubator at 30°
for up to three days. Anaerobic strains were cultured on Reinforced
Clostridial Medium (i.e. RCM; BD Difco™ Reinforced Clostridial
Medium, Cat No. 218081) in a static incubator at 35° for up to five
days.
All cultures were visualized using phase-contrast microscopy
at 100X magnification to verify the presence of refractile spores
(Bulla et al. 1969). A modified version of the protocol used by
Hindle and Hall (1999) was used to detect the presence of DPA.
Using a sterile disposable loop, a 1 µl loopful was taken off a plate
and resuspended in 10 ml of sodium acetate buffer (0.2 M, pH
5) in screw cap glass test tubes. Samples were autoclaved for 15
minutes at 121° to heat the spores and release any DPA. Samples
were then cooled for 10 min in a room temperature (22°) water
bath. Following cooling, for each sample 100 µl was mixed with
100 µl of terbium chloride solution (TbCl3, 30 µM) in wells of
a 96-well flat-bottomed clear microtiter plate. Fluorescence was
measured with a BioTek® Cytation 5 Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek
Instruments, Inc., https://www.biotek.com/) using time resolved
fluorescence (delay 50 µs, excitation wavelength 272 nm, emission
wavelength 540 nm) (Brandes Ammann et al. 2011). Strains testing
higher than negative controls, with a fluorescence intensity of more
than 10,000 relative fluorescence units, and endospores visible with
phase-contrast microscopy were considered DPA-producers.

Whole-genome sequencing and Bioinformatic Analysis
Whole-genome sequencing was performed by CoreBiome (CoreBiome, Inc., https://www.corebiome.com). Briefly, isolates were
grown in appropriate liquid culture. A minimum of 1 x 109 cells
were spun down and the supernatant removed prior to freezing at -20°. Samples were then sent to CoreBiome for DNA extraction, followed by whole-genome sequencing, assembly, and
annotation using their StrainView™ whole-genome shotgun sequencing service. Genome assembly quality was assessed using
QUAST (Gurevich et al. 2013). Whole-genome sequence annotation
was performed using Prokka (https://github.com/tseemann/prokka)
(Seemann 2014). 16S sequences were identified using Barrnap
(https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap). To assign function to CDS
features, a core set of well characterized proteins are first searched
using BLAST+, then a series of slower but more sensitive HMM
databases are searched using HMMER3 (http://hmmer.org) (Finn
et al. 2011).

For each sequence, a BLAST analysis was performed using the
NCBI 16S ribosomal RNA sequence database (Madden 2013). To
make species-level identifications, representative genomes were
retrieved from NCBI and the whole-genome similarity metric Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) was calculated for top 16S BLAST
hits. Whole-genome comparisons with ANI values of greater than
95% were considered to be the same species (Konstantinidis and
Tiedje 2005; Goris et al. 2007). For whole-genome comparisons with
ANI values less than 95%, strains were labeled as Genus sp. (), with

RESULTS
Of the 67 strains included in this study (Table S1), all were Firmicutes representing the classes of Bacilli, Clostridia and Paenibacilli.
As expected, all 49 strains of Bacillus and Paenibacillus (Figure 3,
in black) were found to form endospores via phase-contrast microscopy (see Figures 1 and 2). DPA biosynthesis was detected in
vitro (Table S1), and genome sequences revealed that all of these
strains possessed known DPA synthase genes (Files S2 & S3).

Eight strains of Clostridia which were expected to produce DPA
were found to form endospores via phase-contrast microscopy
(see Figures 5 and 6). DPA biosynthesis was detected in vitro
(Table S1), and genome sequences revealed that two strains of
Clostridium aerotolerans possessed homologs to known DPA sythase
genes, dpaAB (Files S2 & S3). Genome sequences from the remaining six Clostridia (Figure 3, highlighted in red) did not have
detectable known dpaAB or etfA genes (Table 1). etfA contains a
flavin mononucleotide (FMN), therefore a search was performed
for other flavoproteins that contained a FMN and were common
among the six Clostridia that lacked homologs to known DPA
synthesis genes.

While the Clostridium (cluster I) strains lack the recognized DPA
biosynthesis genes, they all possess at least one copy of an ironsulfur flavoprotein (Isf ) (File S4), and strains with more Isf copies
produced more DPA (Table 1). Both etfA and Isf are thought to be
involved in electron transport (Tsai and Saier Jr 1995; Becker et al.

Here we have found that genera was a good predictor of DPA
production, and added experimental evidence to support the production of DPA by additional Bacillaceae. This result, which is
consistent with their previous classification as Bacillus, is yet an
important observation given the functional diversity that these
genera possess. In addition, we found the Clostridium (cluster I)
lack recognized biosynthesis pathways for DPA production. This
result, while similar to previous work (Orsburn et al. 2010), fails to
confirm their findings and we propose an alternate genetic pathway in these strains.
Members of the Bacillaceae family found to produce DPA have
recently been shown to possess many functions and utilities, and
the survivability that DPA production adds, makes these strains
ripe for use in novel products. For example, strains of Brevibacillus have been found to have larvicidal activity (Zubasheva et al.
2010), biological control of plant pathogens (Chandel et al. 2010;
Liu et al. 2010), as well as improving shelf-life of fruits (Che et al.
2011). Fontibacillus strains have been shown to produce a novel
and highly reusable pullanase (Alagöz et al. 2016) which is used as
a processing aid for the production of ethanol or sweeteners from
grain. Lysinibacillus species have been shown to degrade harmful
insecticides (Singh et al. 2012), selectively desulfurize dibenzothiophene (Bahuguna et al. 2011), and produce mosquito larvicidal
toxins (Lozano et al. 2011). In addition, strains can produce 10hydroxystearic acid from olive oil (Kim et al. 2012). Rummeliibacillus species have been shown to transform palm oil mill effluent
to polyhydroxyalkanoate and biodiesel (Junpadit et al. 2017), enhance growth and health in tilapia (Yih et al. 2019), and has the
potential for biomineralization (Mudgil et al. 2018). Finally, Terribacillus species have been found to produce a novel chitinase as
well as antifungal enzymes that repress plant diseases (Essghaier
et al. 2014). Given the wealth of functionalities that this family possesses, coupled with a long shelf-life and potential to survive in a
variety of manufacturing processes due to DPA production, makes
Bacillaceae well suited for industrial processes and an untapped
well of biotechnology potential.

We have confirmed here that some Clostridia possess a DPA
synthase homolog. We have also confirmed that Clostridium (cluster I) do not possess a DPA synthase homolog. Unlike previous
findings, we were unable to identify etfA in our assayed Clostridium
(cluster I) strains. Despite the lack of dpaAB and etfA genes, these
strains were still able to produce detectable quantities of DPA.

We propose the Isf gene product as an alternate pathway for
DPA-production in Clostridium (cluster I). This alternate biosynthesis pathway for DPA synthesis represents a new potential route for
bioengineering the production of DPA in other strains of bacteria
via the addition of a single gene to the lysine pathway, particularly in anaerobes. Dipicolinic acid production has been engineered in bacterial strains using the traditional dpaAB genes (Zelder
et al. 2009; McClintock et al. 2018). DPA has numerous industrial
uses, for example, the monomer can be used as a replacement for
petroleum derived isophthalic acid in the synthesis of polyesters
or polyamide copolymers (McClintock et al. 2018) resulting in a
more biodegradable compound. The scalable synthesis of DPA
using a variety of bacteria could increase its use as a replacement
for other aromatic dicarboxylic acids.
Probiotics have been developed for human use as well as for
use in animal feeds, and a large number of these formulations
utilize spore-forming Bacillus (Hong et al. 2005). Effective probiotics need to thrive in anaerobic conditions and retain viability in
aerobic conditions on the shelf, as well as cross the gastric barrier

and enter the upper GI tract in a viable state following consumption. Probiotics utilizing DPA-producing endospores are proven
to have better survivability during passage through the acidic
stomach environment, show better survival during manufacturing,
and have a longer shelf-life (Bader et al. 2012). The potential of
Clostridia as probiotics has only recently been discussed (Cartman
2011). DPA-containing Clostridial endospores are ideal vehicles
for overcoming the challenges probiotic bacteria encounter, as they
can survive aerobic storage and remain viable while crossing the
host gastric barrier, followed by germination in the anaerobic environment of the upper GI tract where they are well adapted to
survive. Clostridium have been documented as members of healthy
GI tracts in humans (Arumugam et al. 2011; Qin et al. 2010; Tap
et al. 2009), have been shown to increase resistance against Irritable
Bowel Disease (Atarashi et al. 2011), and can protect against C. difficile infection (Merrigan et al. 2009; Sambol et al. 2002). Given the
survivability of DPA-producing Clostridia, and the recently highlighted benefits of Clostridium as members of the gut microbiota,
they may prove to be an ideal probiotic.
In addition, an alternate biosynthesis pathway for DPA represents a new target for designing drugs to prevent contamination, as inhibiting the production of DPA would make endospores
more susceptible to traditional manufacturing procedures. Many
of the endospore-forming bacteria can survive food processing,
decreasing the shelf-life of processed foods (e.g. Clostridium tyrobutyricum), and potentially making them unsafe to consume (e.g.
Clostridium botulinum) (Daelman et al. 2013; Soni et al. 2016; André
et al. 2017). Endospore-forming Clostridium also contain members
that are known for their pathogenic potential, such as Clostridium
(e.g. (C. perfringens, C. novyi, C. septicum, C. tetani, and C. difficile)
(Ehling-Schulz et al. 2019; Wells and Wilkins 1996).
Here we have added experimental evidence to support the production of DPA by additional Bacillaceae and we have proposed an
alternate pathway in Clostridium (cluster I) strains that lack recognized dipicolinic acid biosynthesis genes. By fully understanding
the breadth and mechanisms by which DPA is produced, we can
utilize endospore-forming bacteria in new ways: as novel bacterial
strains added to products, for genes to create inputs for the polymer industry, and to be better equipped to control contaminating
spores in industrial processes.
