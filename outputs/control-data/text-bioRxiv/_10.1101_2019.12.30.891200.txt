Abstract
Growth factors and cytokines activate signal transduction pathways and regulate gene expression in
eukaryotes. Intracellular domains of activated receptors recruit several protein kinases as well as
transcription factors that serve as platforms or hubs for the assembly of multi-protein complexes. The
signaling hubs involved in a related biologic function often share common interaction proteins and target
genes. This functional connectivity suggests that a pairwise comparison of protein interaction partners
of signaling hubs and network analysis of common partners and their expression analysis might lead to
the identification of critical nodes in cellular signaling. A pairwise comparison of signaling hubs across
several related pathways might also reveal novel signaling modules. Analysis of Protein Interaction
Connectome by Venn (PIC-VENN) of transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, NFKB1, RELA, FOS and
JUN, and their common interaction network suggested that BRCA1 and TSC22D3 function as critical
nodes in immune responses by connecting the signaling nodes into signaling modules. Mutations or
differential expression levels of these critical nodes in pathological conditions might deregulate
signaling pathways and their target genes involved in inflammation. Biological connectivity emerges
from the structural connectivity of interaction networks across several signaling hubs in related
pathways. Application of PIC-VENN to several signaling hubs might reveal novel nodes and modules
that can be targeted to simultaneously activate or inhibit cell signaling in health and disease.

Introduction

Signal transduction in mammalian cells is mediated through specific membrane receptors and
intracellular kinases to regulate gene expression [1]. Ligand binding activates receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) activity by auto-phosphorylation or by serving as a substrate for other tyrosine kinases [2].
Receptor phosphorylation can occur at several sites and induce modifications that stimulates intrinsic
enzyme activity or establish docking positions for adaptor proteins that recognize phosphorylated
tyrosine residues. In turn, tyrosine RTKs phosphorylate other substrates, thereby initiating a cascade of
downstream signals including activation of Serine/Threonine protein kinases and multiple transcription
factors. Several enzyme cascades consisting of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and stressactivated protein kinases (SAPK) play critical roles in animal development as well as immune responses
to pathogens [3]. Protein kinases, and transcription factors can serve as critical hubs or platforms for the
assembly of signaling molecules [1-3]. Precision medicine requires the identification of molecular
defects in human genetic diseases at the individual and gene-specific level. Targeting multiple signaling
pathways is often required to prevent resistance to chemotherapy in cancer [4]. Identification of defects
in cell signaling pathways is essential for understanding the molecular basis of human diseases [1-4].
The complexity

of

signaling

pathways

arises from

the diverse

ways protein interactions

connect between signaling molecules to regulate gene expression. Several protein interaction databases
such as STRING, BIOGRID, and WIKI-PI were developed [5-7]. Furthermore, differential mRNA
levels of signaling molecules in a tissue or cell-specific fashion in normal and pathological conditions
were also reported in databases such as Gene Expression across Normal and Tumor tissue (GENT),
Renal Gene Expression Database (RGED) and Lung Cell Transcriptome Explorer [8-11]. The main
objective of this paper is to gain insights into the mammalian signaling pathways by pairwise comparison
of protein interaction partners of critical signaling hubs in multiple related signaling pathways. In

addition, analysis across several hubs in related pathways might reveal critical nodes and modules
involved in cell signaling. It is clear from protein interaction databases that co-operative transcription
factors generally share a large number of common protein interaction partners (5-7). Furthermore, these
transcription factors also share a large number of common target genes. Identification of common
signaling molecules between two signaling hubs and organizing them into a concise interaction network
allows for visualizing the critical connections. Critical nodes and modules across signaling hubs were
determined by functional data analysis of candidates in various databases from knockout, knockdown
or overexpression studies. This approach might reveal modules of functional connectivity across several
signaling hubs in related signaling pathways and provide potential targets to simultaneously activate or
inhibit gene expression.

Methods

All entries of protein interaction partners of signaling hubs in this paper were retrieved from WIKI-PI,
a human protein-protein interaction database [7]. It is worth pointing out that protein interaction
databases differ in the list of interaction partners for each entry based on criteria like in vitro or in vivo
detection and methodologies such as immunoprecipitation, co-expression or yeast 2-hybrid interaction
analysis [5-7]. They also differ in the number of model organisms included on their list. Schematic
representations of cytokine signaling (Figure 2) were modified from previously published reviews [1214]. Microarray data for innate immunity model represented by mouse macrophage cell line (RAW
264.7) treated with Toll-like receptor [TLR] ligands and adaptive immunity model represented by
mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-Kd) expressing influenza HA antigen co-cultured with CD8+ T cells
for 6 hours were used [15.16]. Upstream promoter region (-1000 to +1) of 150 induced genes in
RAW264.7 cells by TLR ligands or 50 induced genes in MLE-Kd cells by CD8+ T cell recognition were
analyzed for transcription factor binding sites using P-SCAN software [17]. Transcription factors

considered most significant in innate and adaptive pathogen responses were shown. Target genes for
RELA, STAT1, JUN, and BRCA1 transcription factors were obtained from Transcriptional Regulatory
Relationships Unravelled by Sentence based Text (TRRUST) database [18].
2.1 Differential Gene Expression Tissue expression data for BRCA1, MYC, NOTCH1, and FBXW7

were obtained from Gene Expression across Normal and Tumor tissue (GENT) database [8]. Relative
mRNA expression levels of BRCA1 and TSC22D3 in control and dexamethasone treated small airway
epithelial cells of human donors were retrieved from the database [11]. Read counts of each gene in the
database were obtained by HTSeq and differential expression results were obtained by DESeq2.
2.2

Protein Interactions Connectome-Venn (PIC-VENN) method of signaling hubs

In the protein network analysis, interaction partners of signaling hubs S1 and S2 were considered. The
overlapping area is V, for “Venn” that includes the elements that are in both sets. This relationship can
be expressed in terms of an overlapping set as shown in a Venn diagram (Figure 1). The PIC-VENN
method consists of three steps. First, Microsoft Excel software was used to construct a simple Venn
diagram of common interaction partners by pairwise comparison of critical signaling hubs. Briefly,
protein interaction partner lists of the two signaling hubs were analyzed for duplicate values in the Excel
program that correspond to common interaction partners of the signaling hubs. In Step 2, a network
diagram of common interaction partners of the hubs together with the critical signaling hubs was
visualized in BIOGRID tool Ensign (Human Mine) or the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting
Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. The interacting proteins or nodes were represented by circles andprotein interactions by lines or edges in the network. In step 3, novel or critical node was selected from
the common interaction partners by determining the biological effect of a node on the signaling pathway
from knock out or over expression studies (from National Center for Biotechnology Information/
Pubmed query) or from differential expression in a disease-specific gene expression databases such as

GENT, Renal Gene Expression Database (RGED) and Lung Cell Transcriptome Explorer (LCTE).
Databases such as Gene cards (www.genecards.org) and mouse genome informatics (www.mgi.org)
also provide concise information on entries related to human and mouse genes for critical node analysis,
respectively.Two or more signaling hubs connected together with a critical node was designated as a
signaling module.

Results and Discussion

3.1 STAT, NF-kB and AP1 family of transcription factors as critical hubs in innate and adaptive

immunity
Cytokines such as Interferons (IFN), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) play an important role in innate immunity [19-21]. Dendritic cells and macrophages
of innate immunity patrol various tissues and produce significant amounts of these cytokines in response
to virus infection [21]. In contrast, CD8+ T cells play an important role in antiviral defense, tumor
suppression and in the control of immunopathology in adaptive immunity [22,23]. After engagement of
the T cell receptor (TCR) by an appropriate antigen-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on a
target cell, activated CD8+ T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- and IFN-[23].
These cytokines activate multiple transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences or ciselements to regulate gene expression. Transcriptional regulatory elements in eukaryotes are
predominantly located within 1 kilobase [kb] of the transcription start site [24,25]. Intracellular signal
transduction pathways play a major role in pathogen response and are regulated by Signal Transducer
and Activator of Transcription (STAT), Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-KB) and Activator Protein (AP1)
members of transcription factors (Figure 2A). Involvement of JAK kinases, IKB kinases as well as
mitogen-activated and stress-activated protein kinases (MAPK/SAPK) such as ERK, JNK, p38 and
activation of transcription factors STAT1, NF-KB and AP1 in target cells in response to cytokines

released from immune cells has been described [3,26,27]. Diversity of signaling and gene expression
are orchestrated by cooperative or alternative binding of distinct members of a transcription factor
family. STAT members like STAT1 and STAT3 bind to gamma activated sequence (GAS) as
homodimers or heterodimers or as trimeric complex of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 to the Interferon
stimulated response element (ISRE). AP1 is a leucine zipper domain containing heterodimeric
transcription complex comprised of FOS and JUN family of transcription factors [3]. The NF-KB family
is a set of five structurally related transcription factors that form homodimers or heterodimers and
function as transcriptional regulators. There are two classes of NF-KB family members: class one
consists of p50/p105 (NFKB1) and p52/p100 (NFKB2) while class two consists of RELA/p65, RELB
and c-REL [27].
The subunit composition of STAT, NF-KB and AP1 transcription factors may vary significantly
during inflammatory response. To establish the frequency of the subunit composition of these
transcription factors in innate immunity, a dataset of 150 genes regulated by Toll-like ligands (TLR) in
RAW 264.7 macrophages were scanned in the promoter region (1 Kb upstream or -1000 to 0) using PSCAN [17]. Members of NF-KB (RELA, REL, NFKB1, NFKB2); STAT/IRF family (STAT1, STAT2,
IRF2, IRF7) and AP1 (FOS, JUN, JUNB) were highly represented (Figure 2B). In addition, a dataset of
50 genes regulated by CD8+ T cell recognition of antigen presenting MLE-Kd lung epithelial cells
representing adaptive immunity were also scanned in the I kb upstream promoter region. Members of
NF-KB (RELA, REL, NFKB2, NFKB1), STAT/IRF family (STAT1, STAT3, IRF7) and AP1 (JUN)
were again highly represented (Figure 2C). These results suggested that transcriptional targets and
biological functions of innate and adaptive immunity were associated with these three classes of
transcription factors. Target genes of signaling hubs of innate and adaptive immunity such as RELA,
STAT1 and JUN also share regulation by a common transcription factor network that includes SP1,

STAT3, IRF1, FOS, TP53, HIFA, CREB1 and MYC suggesting that functional connectivity is mediated
by common protein-protein interactions and target genes (Figure 3).
3.2

Case study 1. Application of PIC-VENN to STAT1, STAT3, RELA and JUN hubs

To determine the common interaction partners of these transcription factors, pairwise comparison of
critical signaling hubs was performed. Venn diagrams of STAT1 versus RELA, STAT1 versus STAT3
and STAT1 versus JUN indicated that there were 14, 13 and 12 common interactions between the hubs,
respectively. Furthermore, comparison of common interacting partners across the hubs revealed that
Breast Cancer Gene or BRCA1 emerged as one of the critical components of these signaling hubs
(Figure 4A). Network analysis using BIOGRID program eSYN showed that BRCA1 emerged as a node
linking RELA, STAT1, and JUN. Protein interactions identified by genetic analysis in the network were
shown in green lines and BRCA1 node was highlighted in yellow color. In addition, a module consisting
of STAT1, BRCA1, JUN and RELA can be identified across the hubs in pathways (Figure 4B). PICVENN results of common interaction partners can be used to search for biological significance in
disease-specific expression array databases. Mutations in BRCA1 are common in breast and ovarian
cancers [28,29]. Comparison of BRCA1 expression in normal and tumor tissues revealed differential
expression in cancers, especially blood cancers (Figure 5A). In addition, cancer cell lines of the blood
including lymphoma and myeloma express high level of BRCA1 (data not shown). These results suggest
that BRCA1 is a novel and critical node and mutations as well as abnormal level of BRCA1 expression
in cells of immune origin may play an important role in cancer. BRCAI is a multifunctional protein with
critical roles in cell cycle, DNA repair and tumor suppression [28]. BRCA1 target genes include several
transcription factors such as STAT1 and STAT3 involved in immunity as well as TP53, MYC and
HIF1A involved in cell growth suggesting that BRCA1 regulates multiple feedback loops that are
involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Table 1). The target genes of BRCA1 also included IRF7

that plays an important role in interferon signaling as well as production of type I interferon [30].
BRCA1 functions in the transcription control of gene expression by interacting with specific
transcription factors like TP53, ER alpha and MYC [31]. BRCA1 also interacts with RNA polymerase
holoenzyme complex, histone acetyl transferases such as CBP/p300 and histone deacetylases such as
HDAC that regulate nucleosome assembly and disassembly [31,32]. In addition, BRCA1 interacts with
DNA methyl transferases and functions as E3 ubiquitin ligase to regulate epigenetic mechanisms such
as methylation and ubiquitination [31]. PIC-VENN studies suggest that BRCA1 may have a major role
in modulating cytokine signaling and a critical role in innate and adaptive immunity. BRCA1 modulates
IFN- signaling by specifically binding to STAT1 after phosphorylation on serine 727 residue [33]. This
serine phosphorylation of STAT1 was highly enhanced in response to synergistic combination of IFN with a variety of cytokines such as TNF- and IL-1 as well as bacterial cell wall component LPS
induced inflammatory gene expression [34, 35]. IFN- caused a decrease in cell proliferation due to
apoptosis in cells expressing wild type BRCA1 and mediated by an upregulation of type I IFN
production [30,36]. BRCA1 was recently identified as a nuclear co-factor to IFI16 in the sensing of
foreign DNA and subsequent cytoplasmic inflammasome formation and secretion of antiviral cytokines
such as IL-1 and IFN- [37]. STAT3 and RELA signaling hubs share 20 common interaction partners.
In addition, BRCA1 emerged as a critical node for the RELA-STAT3-JUN-STAT1 module (Figure 5B).
STAT3 and RELA share about 50 target genes including cytokines, chemokines, matrix
metalloproteases and regulators of cell growth and apoptosis (data not shown). Recent studies have
shown that cytokines that predominantly activate STAT3 and RELA such as IL-6 and TNF- in
combination promote differentiation of human monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC)
into inflammatory macrophages [38]. These results are consistent with a role for BRCA1 in
inflammation, in addition to its well-recognized roles in transcription, cell cycle and DNA repair [32].

Furthermore, BRCA1 also emerged as a critical node in a pairwise comparison of RELA vs JUN or
STAT3 vs JUN signaling hubs (data not shown). Treatment with dexamethasone, a synthetic
glucocorticoid receptor agonist suppressed BRCA1 mRNA levels in human airway epithelial cells
(Figure 5C).
IFN- is involved in the amplification of the inflammatory response by synergy in signaling
with endotoxin, TNF and IL-1 and this synergy further enhances the severity of inflammatory
response in sepsis [23,34,35]. Collaboration of multiple cis-elements and altered dimer composition of
these three classes of transcription factors leading to cross-talk between signal transduction pathways
may play an important role in the diversity of gene expression by transcriptional synergy or antagonism.
3.3

Case study 2. Application of PIC-VENN to AP1 and NF-KB signaling hubs

In addition to inflammatory response, members of NF-KB and AP1 transcription factors are also
activated by diverse stimuli such as cell growth, DNA damage and apoptosis [3,27]. A pairwise
comparison of interaction partners of signaling hubs (FOS versus RELA, JUN versus NFKB1 and FOS
versus JUN) revealed that these three sets also share a small number of interaction partners within the
hubs and across the hubs (Table 2). Network visualization of the common interaction partners across
two (NFKB1 versus JUN and FOS versus JUN) or all three (NFKB1 versus JUN, FOS versus RELA
and FOS versus JUN) pairs of hubs suggested that TSC22D3 or glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper
(GILZ) may act as a novel and critical node linking the module FOS, JUN and NFKB1 (Figure 6A and
6B). Consistent with this prediction, functional studies have revealed that TSC22D3 interacts with NFKB and AP1 and negatively regulated its function [39,40]. AP1 and NF-KB member connections to
negative regulators of signaling such as BCL3 and ATF3 were also highlighted (Figure 6A).
Interestingly, dexamethasone treatment significantly induced TSC22D3 mRNA levels in human airway
epithelial cells (Figure 6C).

Case study 3. Application of PIC-VENN to JAK Kinases in Interferon Signaling

JAK Kinases are critical signaling hubs in growth factor and cytokine signaling including interferon
responses [13,26]. Virus infected cells produce different forms of interferons that serves as a danger
signal to the neighboring cells to establish an antiviral response [20]. Dendritic cells and macrophages
produce type I Interferon (IFN-) after virus infection [19-21]. In contrast, activated NK cells and
CD8+ T cells produce type II Interferon or IFN- [22,23]. JAK1 and TYK2 are activated in type I
Interferon signaling while JAK1 and JAK2 are activated in type II Interferon signaling [26]. Interferon
binds to a specific and distinct receptor on the cell surface and activate JAK-STAT pathway. This
pathway is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several hundred genes [13]. Several Stat1independent pathways are also activated simultaneously, including extra-cellular signal regulated kinase
(ERK1/2), SAPK members such as P38, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) and SRC kinases
[41,42]. The role of JAK kinases in tyrosine phosphorylation and creation of docking site and activation
of STAT signaling is well established [13]. The role of additional tyrosine phosphorylation sites on the
IFN receptor and JAK Kinase interaction partners involved in alternative signaling pathways might play
a role in Stat1-independent IFN signaling remains to be established [41,42]. However, limited
information is available on JAK kinase interacting protein partners involved in these alternative
pathways. Application of PIC-VENN revealed that JAK1 and TYK2 share 16 common interaction
partners and JAK1 and JAK2 share 44 interaction partners. In addition, type I and type II IFN signaling
share 11 common interaction partners (Table 3). JAK1 and JAK2 common interaction network is large
and visualized into two separate sub-networks with roles in IFN- and growth factor signaling (Figure
7A and 7B). Common network interaction partners highlight the role of JAK1 and JAK2 in STAT1 and
STAT3 activation as well as P-I-3-kinase and RAF1 involvement in AKT1 and ERK1/2 activation,
respectively [41]. Analysis of protein interaction network suggested a novel connecting module of P-I-

3-kinase subunit (PI3KR1) to Phospholipase gamma (PLCG) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domain
containing adaptor (SHB/SH2B2) and Signal Transducer and Adaptor (STAM) to JAK2 in IFN and
growth factor signaling. PLCG is involved in the generation of second messengers diacyl glycerol
(DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG leads to the activation of protein kinase C theta and
IP3 imediates an increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium (Ca2+) and activation of the Ca2+dependent kinases and phosphatases [43]. In addition, PLCG plays an important role in lung epithelial
regulation of cell adhesion molecule (ICAM1) by IFN- [44]. The SHB adaptor (SHB) levels were
regulated by interferon, and plays a role in apoptosis and tumor suppression [45-47]. Thus, PIC-VENN
method is capable of revealing novel interacting partners between JAK Kinase signaling hubs in
Interferon signaling. Furthermore, this analysis suggests several ways to test the connection between
specific protein interaction and activation of novel components (highlighted by orange boxes in figures)
of the signal transduction pathways. IFN-  as well as IFN-  activate P-I-3-kinase and AKT1
signaling [48,49]. JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylate and activate IRS1/IRS2 which in turn activate PI3K
in IFN-  signaling [50]. This pathway is evident in the common interaction network of IFN 
signaling (Figure 7C). However, JAK1 and JAK2 are not involved in IRS1/IRS2 activation in IFN-
signaling [50,51]. Protein interaction databases differ in the lists of protein interaction partners of each
entry leading to novel pathways. Visualization of the common interactions between the signaling hubs
and across the signaling hubs in to a pathway in different databases helps to appreciate the similarities
and differences between the signal transduction pathways. Therefore, network visualization of common
interaction pathways in different databases might be useful to gain novel insights into signaling
networks.

Sepsis and septic shock represent the pathological response to infection [14]. Cytokines such as
Interferon- and TNF- as well as double-stranded RNA and bacterial LPS activate STAT1 and RNAdependent protein kinase (EIF2AK2 or PKR) signaling hubs in septic shock resulting in inflammatory
response, apoptosis and tissue injury [52-54]. Apoptosis plays an important role in sepsis-induced
mortality [53,54]. One of the major control points in apoptosis is the sequential activation of Caspases
[54]. Studies have indicated that serum from septic shock patients activated transcription factors such
as STAT1, NF-kB and IRF1 as well as Caspases [55]. Pairwise comparison of STAT1 and EIF2AK2
signaling hubs interactions revealed that common interacting partners include CASPASE 3, CASPASE
7, STAT3, RAC1 and TYK2 suggesting that caspase activation and apoptosis are an important part of
the acute inflammatory response (Table 4). STAT1 regulates the constitutive levels of Caspase
expression [56]. JAK kinases such as TYK2 were shown to be required for the activation of STAT1 and
EIF2AK2 in response to double-stranded RNA or Bacterial RNA [57]. Inhibition of EIF2AK2
attenuated inflammatory response, blocked apoptosis and improved mortality in a mouse model of acute
lung injury [53]. The network diagram of common interaction partners highlighted these experimentally
validated results (Figure 8A). Interaction network visualization also suggested that RAC1 and STAT3
interaction might be important for critical nodes STAT1 and EIF2AK2 to form a module involved in
the regulation of inflammatory response and disease [58,59]. Acute inflammation is a hallmark of high
mortality in pathogen response while chronic inflammation is a characteristic feature of many
inflammatory diseases including cancer [60]. Cancer development involves alteration of signal
transduction pathways leading to constitutive activation of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressors
implicated in the cell cycle regulation. In addition, several studies have shown that two hits in these
critical genes are required to initiate cancer [4,61]. All cancers share some molecular features referred
to as hallmarks such as self-sufficiency in growth signals, loss of response to inhibitory growth signals,

ability to evade programmed cell death or apoptosis and unlimited replication potential [62]. Molecular
defects in cancer are heterogeneous. It is important to understand the critical signaling hubs and
interaction partners perturbed in individual signaling pathways in order to achieve the goals of
personalized medicine [1,2,4], Targeting common interaction partners of two signaling hubs in a signal
transduction pathway may enhance chemotherapy in cancer (Table 4). The following examples include
using PIC-VENN to target transcription factors or kinases or both in various cancers. STAT3 and AKT1
constitute potent survival signals for cancers and are constitutively activated in a variety of cancers [63].
These two signaling hubs share 9 interaction partners including the module containing critical nodes
SRC and MTOR Kinases (Figure 8B). Furthermore, inhibition of these Kinases can be used in
combination to target both pathways in some cancers [64]. Two Serine Kinases STK39 and AKT1 share
the same interaction Protein Kinase, p38 or MAPK14 (Table 4). Consistent with a critical function of
MAPK14 in cancer, inhibition of the STK39 by antisense approach stabilized microtubules, inhibited
cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. This effect was mediated by inhibition of MAPK14
phosphorylation and enhanced paclitaxel sensitivity of ovarian cancer [65]. Constitutive activation of
transcription factors MYC or NOTCH1 occurs in a variety of cancers [66]. These two signaling hubs
share 6 interaction partners, including FBXW7 (Figure 8C). Comparing the expression levels of two
signaling hubs and a common interaction partner in the normal and cancer tissue database provided
clues on the role of this pathway in a particular type of cancer (Figure 9). MYC and NOTCH1 as well
as common interactor FBXW7 expression levels were significantly altered in several cancers, especially
in blood cancers [67]. Consistent with the results, mutations in FBXW7 were reported in 2-6% of
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) resulting in the activation of NOTCH11 intracellular domain
(NCID) and MYC target genes [68]. Network visualization also revealed that RELA, GSK3B

Negative results such as lack of common interaction partners between two signaling hubs can also be
informative suggesting that inhibitors for both hubs can be combined into a single chemotherapy.

Conclusions and Perspectives In summary, signaling hubs in simultaneously activated signaling

pathways share a large number of common interaction partners and target genes involved in a common
biological function suggesting that structural connectivity translates into functional connectivity of
common interaction partners. PIC-VENN provides significant information on critical nodes and
modules when the analysis is carried out across 3 or more pairs of signaling hubs in related signaling
pathways (Figures 4 and Figure 6). Even a comparison of two critical signaling hubs provides some
useful information on novel nodes and modules (Figure 8). Algorithms such as Google PageRank and
Eigenvector Centrality might be helpful in the prediction and ranking of critical nodes from the analysis
of gene perturbation data in the future. Small molecules such as dexamethasone can be used to target
critical nodes such as BRCA1 and TSC22D3 to simultaneously activate or inhibit multiple target genes.
The common protein interaction connectome analysis of critical signaling hubs by PIC-Venn approach
is conceptually similar to the identification of shared genes and signal transduction pathways in a
comparative study of multiple sclerosis and in response to interferon beta treatment [69]. However, this
method was applied to genome-wide analysis (GWAS) of a disease and not critical signaling hubs as
detailed in this report. Human protein interaction miner (HPIminer) is a protein interaction database that
allows combined view of common and unique interacting proteins of signaling hubs in a Cytoscape
program [70]. The entries were curated from Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD). Direct as
well as indirect interactions between signaling hubs were also displayed. However, it is difficult to
follow or identify unique patterns between hubs or across several hubs when large number of common
interactions are involved. Furthermore, the database is limited to human proteins and does not allow for
custom building of selective common interactions into a network. In contrast, PIC-VENN method can

be used for multiple species and elucidation of novel or critical nodes and modules. A major
disadvantage of many protein interactome studies is that they provide a snapshot of expression profile
in cells or tissues at a particular time. However, it is well known that protein interactions and gene
expression are dynamically and temporally regulated during cellular signaling. Further studies are
required to systematically perturb protein interaction network to understand the role of individual nodes
and modules in the dynamic nature of signal transduction pathways [71]. The impact of microbiome
and its products such as small molecules and small proteins on the regulation of mammalian signal
transduction pathways also remains to be investigated [72].
