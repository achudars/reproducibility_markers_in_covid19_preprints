11

induced bistability between competing bacterial species has not been considered

yet. Here we demonstrate a possibility of regime shifts in well-mixed phage-bacterial

ecosystems. In one of the bistable states the fast-growing bacteria competitively

14

exclude the slow-growing ones by depleting their common nutrient. Conversely, in

15

the second state the slow-growing bacteria with a large burst size generate such a

16

large phage population that the other species cannot survive. This type of bistability

17

can be realized as the competition between a strain of bacteria protected from phage

18

by abortive infection and another strain with partial resistance to phage. It is often

19

desirable to reliably control the state of microbial ecosystems, yet bistability signiﬁcantly

20

complicates this task. We discuss successes and limitations of one control strategy in

21

which one adds short pulses to populations of individual species. Our study proposes

22

a new type of phage therapy, where introduction of the phage is supplemented by

23

addition of a partially resistant host bacteria.

Our model predicts these regime shifts in the competition between bacterial strains

the task of manipulation and control of a community. We propose and study a success-

INTRODUCTION

38

Diverse ecosystems are known to be capable of regime shifts in which they abruptly

39

and irreversibly switch between two mutually exclusive stable states (1). Such regime

40

shifts have been extensively studied in both macroscopic and microbial ecosystems (1)

41

and shown to be hysteretic and history-dependent. In microbial ecosystems (2) these

42

transitions are known to be possible when a bacterial species directly produces some

43

metabolic waste products or antibiotics (3) that inhibit the growth of other bacteria.

44

They may also occur when bacterial species compete for several food sources, which

45

they use either in different stoichiometric ratios (4) or in different preferential orders

46

(5). Here we explore a new type of regime shifts caused by interactions between

47

bacteria and phages. Bacteriophages have long been known to increase bacterial

48

diversity, especially in aquatic environments (6, 7). However, their potential to create

49

multiple stable states with distinct bacterial species compositions so far has not been

50

recognized. Here we illustrate a possibility of such alternative stable states and regime

51

shifts using a computational model in which two bacterial species compete for the

52

same food source, and are simultaneously exposed to an infection by the same virulent

53

phage. Such dual constraints are known to abate the usual competitive exclusion (8) by

54

allowing multiple bacterial species consuming the same nutrient to co-exist (9, 7).

55

Microbial communities are an important part of our natural and artiﬁcial surround-

56

ings and are also responsible for many aspects of human health. Some compositions of

57

microbial communities may be useful for us, while other might be detrimental or even

58

lethal. Thus we would like to reliably manipulate and control the species compositions

59

of these systems. Here we explore several strategies aimed to control the state of

60

phage-bacterial ecosystems via short population pulses inducing the desired regime

61

shift.

MODEL AND RESULTS

63

Model We study a model describing the dynamics of two microbial species with

64

populations B 1 and B 2 growing on a single limiting nutrient (e.g. carbon source) with

65

concentration C and infected by a single phage species with population P . All popula-

66

tions are assumed to be well-mixed in an environment constantly supplied with the

67

limiting nutrient at a rate φ. The dynamics of this ecosystem is given by

72

The growth rate of each bacterial species is assumed to be proportional to the nutrient

73

concentration C with the species B 1 growing faster than the species B 2 : λ 1 > λ 2 . Nutri-

74

ent yields of these two species are given by Y1 and Y2 respectively. Phage adsorption

75

coeﬃcients of two species are given by η 1 and η 2 and their burst sizes are β 1 and β 2 .

76

The two bacterial species in our model are assumed to have the same death rate δB

77

that also includes possible contribution from dilution of their shared environment. The

78

death/dilution rate of the phage is given by δ P and the nutrient is diluted at a rate δC .

79

Conditions for bistability and regime shifts In what follows we explore the

80

steady state solutions of Eqs. 1-4, - the only asymptotic dynamical behavior possible

81

in our system. In the absence of phages, the faster growing species B 1 would always

82

eliminate the slower growing species B 2 due to competitive exclusion (8). Phages in

83

principle allow for a slow-growing species to co-exist with the fast-growing one or even

84

to completely take over the ecosystem. In order for this to happen in high-nutrient/high-

85

phage environments the species B 2 needs to be less susceptible to phage infections

86

than the species B 1 : λ 1 /η 1 < λ 2 /η 2 . In the extreme case, where the species B 2 is fully

FIG 1 Alternative stable states and regime shifts in a phage-bacterial ecosystem. A) The diagram of interactions between the
three species and one nutrient resource in our model: the fast-growing (red, B 1 ) and the slow-growing (blue, B 2 ) bacterial species
are limited by the same nutrient C and infected by the same phage P . The slow-growing bacteria are more protected from
infections by phage, but, if infected, they generate a larger burst size. The negative effective interaction from B 1 to B 2 is mediated
via the nutrient, while that from B 2 to B 1 - via the phage. B) A representative stochastic simulation of the model. Note the abrupt
and large regime shifts of the ecosystem between two alternative stable states dominated by bacteria B 1 and B 2 correspondingly.
All populations are always maintained above a very low level 4 × 10−4 provided by a weak inﬂux of species to the ecosystem. Both
phage and nutrient concentrations experience a discontinuous shift up if the ecosystem suddenly ﬂips from the B 1 -dominated
state to the B 2 -dominated one and down in the opposite case. The model parameters are λ 1 = 1, λ 2 = 0.8, Y1 = Y2 = 1, η 1 = 0.20,
η 2 = 0.15, β 1 = 2, β 2 = 40, δ C = δ B = δ P = 0.2 and φ = 0.66.

resistant to the phage (η 2 = 0), the co-existence between these bacterial species has

88

been previously identiﬁed and computationally studied (9, 7, 10).

89

Here we introduce and study another regime of a phage-bacterial ecosystem in

90

which two bacterial species could mutually exclude each other. This falls under the

91

category of discontinuous and abrupt regime shifts between alternative stable states in

92

microbial ecosystems (see Ref. (2) for a review), which have been previously modelled

93

in the context of competition for nutrients (5, 4) and without phages. In order for a

94

phage-bacterial ecosystem to be in principle capable of bistability, the slow-growing

95

bacterial species needs to produce disproportionately more phages per each unit

96

of consumed nutrient than the fast-growing one: Y2 β 2 > Y1 β 1 . As we show in the

97

Supplementary Materials, the bistability requires the following three inequalities to be

Figure ??A illustrates the basic mechanisms responsible for bistability and regime

103

shifts in our ecosystem. The thickness of each arrow scales with the relative strength

104

of the interaction between the nodes it connects. Thus the width of the arrow pointing

105

from the nutrient to the bacterial species B i reﬂects its growth rate λi , while that of the

106

arrow pointing in the opposite direction - the rate λi /Yi at which this bacterial species

107

depletes the nutrient. Similarly, the width of the arrow pointing from the phage to the

108

bacterial species B i reﬂects its adsorption coeﬃcient ηi , while that of the arrow going

109

in the opposite direction - the rate β i ηi at which this bacterial species generates new

110

phages.

111

Figure ??B shows a stochastic simulation of our model with parameters λ 1 = 1,

112

λ 2 = 0.8, Y1 = Y2 = 1, η 1 = 0.20, η 2 = 0.15, β 1 = 2, β 2 = 40, δC = δB = δ C = 0.2 and φ = 0.66

113

(see Methods for details). In our simulations we do not allow the population of either of

114

three species (B 1 , B 2 , and P ) to fall below a very small value 4 × 10−4 . This is equivalent

115

to keeping a constant but weak inﬂux of these species to the ecosystem. As a result,

116

each species would start growing as soon as ecosystem’s internal parameters would

117

make its net growth rate positive.

118

Random ﬂuctuations in population sizes of bacteria and phages could trigger

119

spontaneous regime shifts between two alternative stable states of the ecosystem

120

visible in Figure ??B. One of these states is dominated by the fast growing bacterial

121

species B 1 . It suppresses the slow-growing species B 2 by the virtue of competitive

122

exclusion via their shared nutrient. In the second stable state the slow-growing species

123

B 2 with a large burst size β 2 , generates such a high population of phages that they

124

completely eliminate the fast-growing species B 1 , which is relatively more susceptible

125

to phage infections. This steady state also has a larger nutrient concentration due to a

126

slower rate of its depletion by the species B 2 .

127

History dependence of the ecosystem state When Eqs. (5-7) are satisﬁed, the

128

bistability is possible only in a certain intermediate range of the nutrient supply rate.

129

Fig. 2A-D shows the changes in, respectively, steady state values of P , B 1 , B 2 and

130

C when the nutrient supply rate φ is slowly changed ﬁrst up from 0 to 1 and then

131

down to 0 again. For very low nutrient supply rates φ < 0.04 neither bacteria nor

132

phages can survive and the system stays abiotic B 1 = B 2 = P = 0. The fast-growing

133

bacteria B 1 ﬁrst appears for φ ≥ 0.04 and prevents the appearance of the slow-growing

FIG 3 Control of the ecosystem by a pulse in phage population P (panel A), resource concentration C (panel B), bacterial populations B 2 (panel C), or B 1 (panel D). Red symbols mark the B 1 -dominated state, while blue symbols - the B 2 -dominated state. In
the region marked with red crosses phages cannot exist: P = 0. The x -axis is the nutrient supply rate φ with the bi-stable region
conﬁned between two black solid lines. The y -axis is the magnitude of the pulse normalized by the population/concentration of
the target stable state, that is to say, by that of the B 2 -dominated state in panels A-C and of the B 1 -dominated state in panel D.
For nutrient supply rates 0.27 < φ < 0.7 the B 1 -dominated state (red) can be switched to the B 2 -dominated state (red) by adding
a suﬃciently large pulse of phage P (panel A), nutrient C (panel B), or bacteria B 2 (panel C). Conversely, for 0.23 < φ < 0.46 the
B 2 -dominated state (blue) can be switched to the B 1 -dominated state (red) by adding a suﬃciently large pulse of bacteria B 1 (panel
D).

134

species due to competitive exclusion. As the nutrient supply rate is increased above

135

0.14, the population of the phage P becomes sustainable and linearly increases with φ.

136

B 2 continues to be competitively excluded until much higher rate of nutrient supply

137

φ (1) = 0.70, at which the ecosystem undergoes a regime shift to the state dominated by

138

B 2 and excluding B 1 . This alternative stable state persists all the way up the nutrient

139

supply rate. The growth of B 1 is prevented by a high phage population to which this

140

species is especially susceptible. When φ is lowered, the B 2 -dominated state survives

141

down to the nutrient supply rate φ (2) = 0.23, which is much lower than φ (1) = 0.70. Thus

142

for nutrient supply rates between 0.23 and 0.70 the ecosystem is bistable and can be in

143

any of the two alternative stable states making upper and lower parts of the hysteresis

144

loops in Fig. 2A-D. Note that the population of phages and the concentration nutrients

145

generally change in synchrony: when B 1 is dominant, both phage and nutrient levels

146

are low, while the dominance of B 2 generates many phages which signiﬁcantly lower

147

its population and prevent it from fully exploiting resources, thereby keeping C high.

148

Controlling regime shifts by population pulses Phages have recently been in-

149

vestigated as potential agents of control of populations of individual bacterial species

150

in the gut microbiome (11). However, when alternative stable states are present, the

151

state of an ecosystem is complicated by hysteresis and history dependence.

Regime shifts in a phage-bacteria ecosystem

152

One may need to switch a microbial ecosystem from an undesirable/diseased state

153

to a desirable/healthy state without perturbing the environmental parameters such

154

as nutrient supply rate. One way to achieve such control is by adding a ﬁxed amount

155

of one of the species P , B 1 , B 2 , or of the nutrient C giving rise to an instantaneous

156

increase of its current population/concentration. Such one-time addition, which we call

157

a “population pulse”, is similar to the “impulsive control strategy” discussed in Ref. (12).

158

Since P , C , and B 2 are all higher in the B 2 -dominated state than in the B 2 -dominated

159

state, adding a population pulse of either one of them to the B 1 -dominated state could,

160

in principle, trigger a regime shift. Similarly, adding a population pulse of B 1 to the

161

B 2 -dominated state could result in a regime shift in the opposite direction.

162

Fig. 3 explores successes and limitations of the population pulse strategy. We

163

found that this strategy works but only within a certain range of nutrient supply that is

164

generally more narrow than the bistability region itself. A regime shift from the B 1 - to

165

the B 2 -dominated state can be triggered across the entire bistability region. Conversely,

166

a regime shift from the B 2 - to the B 1 -dominated state by adding a pulse of B 1 can be

167

made only for φ below 0.46, which is lower than φ (1) = 0.7 - the upper bound of the

168

bistable region (the right solid line in Fig. 3). Another observation is the reentrant

169

transition in Fig. 3D: adding too much of B 1 to the B 2 -dominated state may prevent

170

the regime shift from taking place. We also note that in order to trigger a regime

171

shift one generally needs to add a pulse that would transiently make the population

172

of the perturbed species to exceed its steady state value in the targeted state (pulse

173

normalized to 1 on the y-axis in Fig. 3). Indeed, a pulse changes only one out of four

174

populations/concentrations in our ecosystem. Thus it needs to be large enough to

175

drive the remaining three populations in the general direction of the regime shift.

176

Consider a situation where we can simultaneously perturb all three species and

177

the nutrient and set their populations/concentrations (C , B 1 , B 2 , and P ) to any desired

178

value. In this case, transient populations after a pulse could be made smaller than their

179

steady state values in the target state. Indeed, to switch the state of the ecosystem, it

180

would be suﬃcient to make all four populations/concentrations just a little bit closer to

181

the target state than their values in the dynamically unstable state shown as dashed

182

lines in Fig. 2A-D.

183

Model with perfect abortive infection in B 1 In one of the phage defense mech-

184

anisms called abortive infection (Abi) (13) phages enter and kill the host without pro-

185

ducing any phage progeny. A special limit of our model is obtained when the species

186

B 1 is characterized by abortive infection: β 1 = 0, while η 1 > 0. Our equations in this case

187

predict φ (1) = ∞, which means that B 1 would not disappear from the ecosystem for

188

any nutrient supply φ. Indeed, this species generates no phage progeny, thus it always

189

can outcompete a small amount of the slower-growing species B 2 infected by phages.

190

However, analogous to Fig. 3A,C a suﬃciently large population pulse of B 2 and P can

191

get established in the system and eliminate B 1 . This could happen for φ > φ (2) .

192

DISCUSSION

193

We introduced a mathematical model of regime shifts in phage-bacterial ecosystems.

194

The alternative stable states in our model are populated by different bacterial species

195

mutually excluding each other. The negative interactions between these species are

196

mediated by either their co-infecting phages or their shared nutrients. In this respect

197

the mechanism of bistability in our model is similar to that in consumer resource

198

models without phages (4). Indeed, the mandatory (but not suﬃcient) condition for

199

bistability in either of these two models is a signiﬁcant difference in stoichiometry of

200

competing microbial species. In our model this stoichiometry is quantiﬁed by Y · β

201

- the product of nutrient yield and burst size of a given bacterial species. It can be

202

interpreted as the conversion factor connecting the amount of nutrients used to build

203

a single bacterial cell to the number phages it produced upon lysis. Comparison of

204

inequalities in Eq. 6 and Eq. 7 shows that bistability is possible only when conversion

205

factors of two bacterial species are suﬃciently different from each other: Y2 · β 2 > Y1 · β 1 .

206
207

Similarly, multistability studied in Refs. (14, 4) requires species competing for two
types of essential resources (e.g. C and N) to have different C:N stoichiometries.

208

Regime shifts and multistability are known to occur when competition between

209

species in principle allows for their co-existence, while the differences in stoichiometry

210

make such coexistence dynamically unstable (14, 4). This is also true in our model,

211

where bistability between species B 1 and B 2 is possible whenever their co-existence

212

is dynamically unstable. Conversely, a dynamically stable co-existence of B 1 and B 2 is

213

possible whenever inequalities given by Eqs 5-6 are satisﬁed, while that in the Eq. 7

214

changes the direction to λ 1 /(Y1 β 1 η 1 ) < λ 2 /(Y2 β 2 η 2 ).

215

Our model predicts that regime shifts in phage-microbial ecosystems can be a

216

consequence of differences in species’ yields Y2 > Y1 rather than their burst sizes. A

217

negative correlation between species’ growth rate and its yield known as rate-yield

218

trade-off is widely known (15). According to this correlation slower growing species

219

tend to have higher yields thereby facilitating bistability in our model.

220

A general case of predator-prey food webs with multiple trophic levels has been

221

considered in Ref. (16, 17). For certain combinations of parameters one can prove that

222

the steady state of dynamical equations describing such ecosystems is unique and thus

223

multistability is impossible. This proof, based on the Lyapunov function proposed in

224

Ref. (18), requires the food web to have identical stoichiometry products (like Yi β i in our

225

model) for all paths connecting the same pair of species. Here we extend this study by

226

showing that if the difference in stoichiometries of two such paths is suﬃciently large,

227

multistability could in principle emerge. Thus, it is tempting to extend our mechanism

228

for multistability up from microscopic phage-bacterial ecosystems to macroscopic

229

predator-prey food webs. In order for macroscopic food webs to be multistable, the

230

biomass conversion ratio between two successive trophic levels has to deviate widely

231

from its typical value of about 10% (19, 20) and be suﬃciently different for different

232

species in the same trophic level. Indeed, one could always choose to measure the

233

population of each species in units of its biomass per unit area. These units would

234

rescale absolute values of competition parameters such as λ and η. In these units

235

stoichiometric coeﬃcients Y and β are given by the eﬃciency (0%-100%) of biomass

236

conversion between two consecutive trophic levels. Multistability requires suﬃcient

237

differences in biomass conversion factors along paths between species in different

238

trophic levels. For example, in our model the nutrient, which can be thought to occupy

239

the trophic level 0 is connected to the phage species (trophic level 2) via paths going

240

through two different bacterial species (intermediate trophic level 1). Furthermore,

241

the number of species in intermediate trophic levels of these paths has to be odd.

242

Given that the overall number of trophic levels rarely exceeds 4, the case of a single

243

intermediate trophic level considered in this study represents the most biologically

244

plausible scenario.

245

The ecosystem used in our study is very simple: it has low species diversity and a

246

single growth-limiting nutrient. This simplicity allowed us to quantitatively understand

247

the principal mechanisms giving rise to bistability. More complex ecosystems with a

248

larger number of species and multiple nutrients are expected to have qualitatively

249

similar properties. They also could have a much more complicated phase diagram

250

in the space of nutrient supply rates. Hence multistability with more than two stable

Regime shifts in a phage-bacteria ecosystem

251

states could be realized in some regions of this space (See Ref. (4) for this type

252

of multistability in consumer resource models). Another limitation of our model is

253

that it ignores the possibility of rapid evolution of bacterial strains competing with

254

phages. Such red queen dynamics often generates phage-resistant bacterial strains.

255

The appearance of a phage-resistant variant of B 1 would modify the behavior of our

256

ecosystem for very high nutrient supply, but might not affect bistability between B 1 and

257

B 2 for intermediate nutrient supply studied above. This depends on the magnitude of

258

the growth deﬁciency of the resistant mutant. A delicate interplay between multiple

259

strains and species could be understood by visualizing them all in Fig. 4A, where a

260

phage-resistant strain would be shown as a vertical line.

261

It is instructive to compare the mechanisms of bistability in our model to two

262

previously described bistable systems involving phages and bacteria. One example of

263

alternative stable states in a phage-microbial ecosystem has been described in Ref. (21).

264

Unlike in our model, where regime shifts change the composition of bacterial species,

265

the ecosystem modeled in Ref. (21) switches between the states with and without

266

phages. The main feature responsible for this switching behaviour is a decrease of

267

adsorption coeﬃcient of the bacterial host when nutrients become scarce. Similar to

268

regime shifts in our ecosystem, the feedback between the nutrient concentration and

269

the abundance of phages is at the core of this bistable behavior.

270

Perhaps the most celebrated example of a bistable system is the genetic switch

271

operating inside a bacterial host of a temperate phage (22, 23). In a host of the

272

prophage λ there is an intracellular competition between the dormant, lysogenic state

273

dominated by the repressor protein C1 (24), and the virulent, lytic state dominated

274

by the protein Cro (25). When Cro wins, it leads to production of a large number of

275

phages, akin to the species B 2 in our microbial ecosystem. High nutrient concentration

276

in the environment typically favors the lytic state of the λ-host (26). Such lytic state is

277

analogous to the B 2 -dominated regime in our ecosystem, also favored by high C . In

278

this sense our ecosystem can be in the “dormant state” producing few phages when it

279

is dominated by B 1 . When this state is exposed to a strong pulse of P , C , or B 2 it can

280

switch to the “lytic state” dominated by B 2 and producing many phages (see Fig. 3).

281

One realistic implementation of bistability predicted by our model is in a phage-

282

microbial ecosystem consisting of a bacterial strain protected against phages by the

283

abortive infection (Abi) mechanism (B 1 ) and a partially-resistant strain (B 2 ) co-infected

284

by the same phage. Hosts with abortive infection allow phages to enter and kill them

285

without producing a noticeable phage progeny (13). An example of the Abi defense

286

is provided by certain types of CRISPR defense (27, 28, 29), where phages kill most of

287

infected hosts but have zero or small burst size. In contrast to Abi- or CRISPR-protected

288

bacteria, partially resistant strains may arise due to a mutation in the receptor protein

289

which reduces both the growth rate (30) and the phage adsorption but has little effect

290

on the burst size. Thus regime shifts may naturally occur as a consequence of diverse

291

phage defence mechanisms in microbial ecosystems (31).

292

A potential application of our system is in a new type of phage therapy in which

293

phages targeting the pathogenic species (B 1 ) are introduced together with carefully

294

selected non-pathogenic species (B 2 ) infected by the same phage. This therapy effec-

295

tively combining two population pulses shown in panels A and C of Fig. 3 would lead to

296

a more eﬃcient and permanent elimination of the fast-growing pathogen (B 1 ). One

297

of the advantages of this approach is that phages would be continually present in the

298

former patient thereby preventing reentry of pathogenic bacteria. The strategy could

299

be made even more favourable if the bacteria added together with phages would use

300

a nutrient other than C rendering it not vulnerable to nutrient competition from the

METHODS

303

Simulations The paper investigates the dynamics of a model deﬁned by Eqs. (1-4),

304

built on assumptions of mass action kinetics in a well-mixed system with an adjustable

305

nutrient supply rate (32). We performed both deterministic and stochastic simulations

306

of this model.

307

In stochastic simulations shown in Fig. 1B we use the Gillespie algorithm with step

308

size of 0.0002 and rates deﬁned for each of the 9 basic processes in Eqs 1-4: nutrient

309

introduction and dilution events, B 1 and B 2 replication events, phage infection events

310

separately in B 1 and in B 2 , and combined death/decay/dilution events in each of the

311

two bacteria and one phage species. Notice that a single phage infection event reduces

312

the bacterial population by the step size equal to 0.0002, but increases the phage

313

population by β · 0.0002. A large value of the burst size β 2 = 40 justiﬁes a small step size

314

used in our simulations.

315

Deterministic simulations shown in Fig. 2 solve the dynamics given by Eqs. (1-

316

4). At each value of nutrient supply rate φ we integrate the equations for 1000 time

317

units to eliminate transients. We then increase the nutrient supply rate in increments

318

∆φ = 0.01. We use the steady state populations/concentrations obtained at φ as

319

starting populations/concentrations for simulations at φ + ∆φ .

320

Each blue or red dot in Fig. 3 was obtained by starting the system in one of

321

the stable states, and subsequently changing one of the variables (P , C , B 1 or B 2 ) as

322

indicated on the y-axis. After a deterministic simulation of dynamical Eqs. (1-4) for

323

1000 time-units, the ﬁnal state is compared to each of the states possible for a given

324

value of φ and is marked with the corresponding color Fig. 3.

325

Conditions for bistability In our model it is convenient to describe the growth of a

326

microbial species in (C , P ) coordinates, characterizing respectively the nutrient and the

327

phage concentrations in the environment. The population of a species exponentially

328

grows for λC − ηP > δB , exponentially decays for λC − ηP < δB , and stays constant for

329

λC − ηP = δ B . The last equation deﬁnes the so-called Zero Net Growth Isocline (ZNGI)

330

(14) of the species deﬁned by all environmental parameters where the population of

331

this species could be in a steady state. Everywhere in the region of the (C , P )-plane

332

located to the right and below of species ZNGI (high C and small P ) its population

333

exponentially grows, while in the region to the left and above its ZNGI (low C and large

334

P ) it exponentially decays.

335

Red and blue straight lines in Fig. 4A correspond to the Zero Net Growth Isoclines

336

(ZNGI) of, correspondingly, the fast- and the slow-growing bacterial species in our

337

model. They intersect at the point (C ∗ , P ∗ ) given by

338

C∗

δB · (η 1 − η 2 )
λ 1 λ 2 · ( λη11 − λη22 )

P∗

λ 1 λ 2 · ( λη11 − λη22 )

(9)

340

The intersection point correspond to the only set of environmental parameters at

341

which these two species can potentially coexist with each other.

342

The lower part of the species 1 ZNGI (the solid part of the red line) extending from

343

P = 0 and up to the intersection point at P ∗ and the upper part of the species 2 ZNGI

344

above P ∗ (the solid part of the blue line) have a special property that the other species

345

would not be able to grow in this environment. Hence, the union of these two halves

346

of ZNGIs corresponds to uninvadable states of the ecosystem, which are the main

FIG 4 Geometric solution of the steady state of the ecosystem. A) Steady state C and
P are from solving Eqs. (2-3). When both bacteria B 1 and B 2 are present the system can
only be at the intersection (C ∗ , P ∗). In our case this state is dynamically unstable. As φ
increases, the environmental parameters (C , P ) follow the solid red line up to the black
dot, then discontinuously jumps to the blue cross and continues up along the solid blue
line. When φ subsequently decreases in the hysteresis loop shown in Fig. 2, the (C , P )
follow the solid blue line down to the black dot, discontinuously jumps to the red cross
and continues down along the solid red line. This trajectory is shown in black lines with
arrows. B) The geometric solution for coexisting bacterial populations is given by the
intersection of the grey line, where the phage population is at the steady state P = P ∗
(Eq. 14), and the green line, where the nutrient concentration is at the steady state
C = C ∗ (Eq. 15). The green line shifts up as the nutrient supply φ is increased. Bacterial populations B 1 (B 2 ) disappear at the boundaries φ (1) (φ (2) ) of the bistability region
φ (2) < φ < φ (1) . Here we show an example in which the steady state C ∗ , P ∗ is dynamically
unstable giving rise to bistability. However, if the grey line has a steeper slope than the
green line, the bistability is replaced by the region (φ (1) < φ < φ (2) ) of stable coexistence
of B 1 and B 2 .

straight lines in the (B 1 , B 2 )-plane shown in Fig. 4B. The grey line corresponds to the

(15)

These lines intersect for positive B 1 and B 2 when φ (1) < φ < φ (2) .

375

In the opposite case, where φ (1) > φ (2) , the system is capable of bistability for

376

nutrient supply rates φ (2) < φ < φ (1) . To understand this it is useful to follow the

377

trajectory of environmental parameters (C , P ) as φ is gradually increased. For φP 1 <

378

φ < φ (1) the environmental parameters follow the ZNGI of the fast growing species

379

1 (the red line in Fig. 4A below the intersection with the blue line). Immediately

380

above the intersection point (C ∗ , P ∗ ), realized for nutrient supply rate slightly larger

381

than φ (1) , the ecosystem becomes invadable by the species 2. However, for this

382

species the intersection point (C ∗ , P ∗ ) corresponds to a lower value of nutrient supply

383

φ (2) < φ (1) . Hence after a brief transient period the environmental parameters (C , P )

384

of our ecosystems move to the position marked with the blue cross in Fig. 4A. As φ

385

continues to increase above φ (1) , the environmental parameters follow the ZNGI of the

386

species 2 (the blue line to the right of the blue cross in Fig. 4A).

387

If at some point one starts decreasing φ, the species 2 will persist down to φ (2) at

388

which the environmental parameters are again at the coexistence point (C ∗ , P ∗ ). For

389

slightly lower φ the environmental parameters will discontinuously jump to the point

390

marked with the red cross on the ZNGI of the species 1. For even lower nutrient supply

391

rates they will continue to follow the ZNGI of the species 1 to the left and below of the

392

red cross. Hence, our environment is bistable in the interval of two ZNGIs between the

393

red and blue crosses. The lower red part of this interval is reachable only when φ is

394

increased from a low value below φ (2) , while the upper blue part - when φ is decreased

395

from a high value above φ (1) .

In the regime where φP 1 < φ (2) < φ (1) and for nutrient supply rates in the bistable

Note that in our study we consider only uninvadable states of the ecosystem.

In other words, we ignore an invadable steady state, where for a small value of φ

424

the ecosystem is populated only by the species 2, or another invadable steady state

425

realized for a large value of φ , where the ecosystem has only the species 1. These

426

states are located on invadable parts of each species’ ZNGI, which are to the right and

427

below the ZNGI of the other species in Fig. 4A. Indeed, in these regions an arbitrary

428

442

The bacterial abundances anywhere within this interval of nutrient supply rates are

443

given by B 1(F ) = 0.5, B 2(F ) = 0 or B 1(S ) = 0, B 2(S ) = 0.0333 in alternative stable states

444

dominated respectively by the fast and the slow-growing bacterial species.
The other transitions visible in Figure 2 happen at φB1 = 0.04 above which the

445
446

bacterial species 1 is able to survive given the dilution rate δ, and φP 1 = 0.14, above

447

which the phage can survive in this ecosystem.

448

To estimate the typical values of C and P in two bistable states let us consider one

449

example when φ = 0.25 is slightly above φ(2) . In this case the steady state concentrations

450

of the nutrient and the phage in two alternative stable states: F and S are given by

451

C (F )

=

0.357;

C (S ) = 1.277

(34)

452

P (F )

=

0.786;

P (S ) = 5.476

(35)

453

The dynamically unstable steady state point always has C ∗ = 1 and P ∗ = 4, which

454

are located between their values in the F and S states. The bacterial abundances in

455

an unstable state for φ = 0.25 are given by B 1(U ) = 0.0246 and B 2(U ) = 0.0317. Note that

456

the steady state abundance of the species 1 in the unstable state is much lower than

457

its abundance B 1(F ) = 0.5 in the stable state. That suggests why for such a low value of

458

φ we found it impossible to switch the ecosystem from the F state to the S state by

459

pulses of C , P , or B 2 . Indeed, neither of these transient pulses is capable of lowering

460

down B 1 to the extra low saddle point value B 1(U ) = 0.0246 from initial stable state value

461

of B 1(F ) = 0.5 without simultaneously moving the populations of other species away

462

from the saddle point region.

463

The position of the crosses in Fig. 4A can be calculated as follows: at φ = φ (1) = 0.7

464

the species 1 sets the environmental parameters of the ecosystem exactly at the

465

intersection point (C ∗ , P ∗ ) = (1, 4) between ZNGIs of species 1 and 2. For slightly

466

higher nutrient supply rates the species 2 eliminates the species 1 and the nutrient

467

concentration shifts to C 2x =

468

(λ 2 C 2x −δ B )/η 2 = 15.14. On the way down the bacterial species 1 reenters the ecosystem

469

slightly below φ = φ (2) = 0.2266. When the species 1 replaces the species 2 immediately

470

below this point the nutrient concentration shifts to C 1x =

471

the phage population - to P 1x = (λ 1 C 1x − δ B )/η 1 = 0.6190.
