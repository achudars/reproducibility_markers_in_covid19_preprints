Abstract
Objectives
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become the main cause of mortality in China. In
2009, the Chinese government introduced the Public Health Service Equalization (PHSE)
program to restore the primary healthcare system in both essential medical care and public
health service provision. This study evaluates the impact of management on hypertension
control and evaluate how the program works.

Methods
The China National Health Development Research Centre (CNHDRC) undertook the Crosssectional Health Service Interview Survey (CHSIS) of 62,097 people from primary healthcare
reform pilot areas, across 17 provinces from eastern, central and western parts of China in
2014. This study is based on CHSIS survey responses from 9,607 participants, who had been
diagnosed with hypertension. Regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of
management provided under PHSE on hypertension control adjusting for the effects of other
known determinants of hypertension control.

Findings
Uncontrolled hypertension was markedly lower among respondents, whose hypertension had
been managed (22.4% in managed patients versus 31.1% in unmanaged patients, p<0.001).
The interaction between PHSE management and the geographical region was highly
significant in the model (p<0.001), suggesting that the PHSE program was not equally
effective in all regions. Further analysis suggested that approximately 10% of regional
variability was attributed to differences in administrative systems, as there was a significant
association (P=0.014) between the presence of established regional Information Management
Systems (IMS) and increased PHSE effectiveness. Insurance (χ2(5)=4.4, p=0.496) and Hukou
(χ2(1)=2.4, p=0.121), which denote social security and urban rural differences, respectively,
were not significant predictor of hypertension control.

Conclusion
Active management of hypertension through the PHSE program was effective with 7.31
million more patients receiving hypertension control and equalization of service delivery was
reflected to some extent. The link between established IMS and regional variability in the
impact of PHSE highlights the importance of effective management of patient referrals and
follow-up. Further investigation is needed to explore the factors that influence the
effectiveness of PHSE.

1. Introduction
The leading causes of mortality in China have shifted relatively quickly from infectious
diseases and perinatal conditions to chronic diseases and injuries [1,2]. This has been
accompanied by an increase in hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors which were
responsible for 1.7 million deaths from stroke and 948,700 deaths from ischemic heart
diseases in 2010 [3], making these factors the leading causes of death in China. In recognition
of the failure of the prevailing health system at the time, the central government introduced a
new healthcare reform plan in 2009 to restore the primary healthcare system in both essential
medical care and public health service provision [4]. One important measure was the program
entitled “Public Health Service Equalization for All (PHSE)” which supports community

health organizations to deliver a defined package of basic health services throughout the
country [5]. In urban areas, these organizations are called community health centers and
stations; in rural areas they are township health centers and village clinics. This essential
health care package was designed to equalize essential health care packages, and focused on
maternal and child health, elderly people, and chronic disease patients. A major aim of the
program is to combat the increasing burden imposed by non-communicable diseases (NCDs),
through a range of measures including health education and management of hypertension and
diabetes [6], similar to the recommendations by the WHO for essential packages of
interventions for non-communicable diseases by primary care facilities [7].
Funding for the program was provided by the Government initially on the basis of 15 Chinese
yuan (CNY) per capita each year, which was increased to 20 CNY in 2011 and 50 CNY in
2017 [8]. From 2009 to 2013, over 140 billion CNY (or around USD 21 billion) was invested
in this program. It has been estimated that about 18% of this investment was spent on
management of patients with hypertension for a total of around 25.2 billion RMB (or USD
3.8 billion) [9]. By the end of 2013, the number of primary health care facilities providing
services under the PHSE reached 2.96 million, including 476,073 community health service
centers (or stations), 1,244,054 township hospitals, and 1,238,022 village clinics [10]. The
specifications for the PHSE and the requirements for service delivery were revised in 2011,
2013 and 2017, ensuring that hypertensive patients aged 35 and over, be followed-up,
monitored and evaluated on a regular basis. However, little is known about the effectiveness
and benefit of such a large investment, especially from the population’s perspective.
A longitudinal cohort study of the Chinese population, the China Health and Retirement
Longitudinal Study (CHARLES) conducted in 2015 demonstrated that factors such as age,
sex, smoking habits, drinking habits, household income, health insurance, BMI, residential
region, marital status, educational level and nationality were significantly associated with the
status of hypertension: awareness, treatment and control [11]. A recent cross-sectional study
[12] discovered that a lower likelihood of awareness and treatment of hypertension was
associated with younger age, lower income, males, with an absence of previous cardiovascular
events, diabetes, obesity, or alcohol use.
Also the rate of control of hypertension was universally low across all subgroups. Data from
the CHARLS has highlighted the importance of health insurance in the ability of patients to
control hypertension [13]. However, very few evaluations have focused on the role of primary
care facilities in hypertension control, although primary care in low-resource settings is
considered to be the backbone for implementation of essential NCD interventions [7,14].
Two related reports have described the progress of the PHSE program. The Annual Report of
Essential Public Health Services Performance Evaluation has been conducted every year since
2010 by the Center for Project Supervision and Management of National Health and Family
Planning Commission (NHFPC) [15]. It reported that from 2011 to 2013, the number of
hypertensive patients managed by the program increased from 65,864 million to 85,030
million. Another report conducted by the Community Health Association of China (CHAC)
in 2014 [16], was similar to the NHFPC 2013 evaluation. However, none of these studies
evaluated the effectiveness of the PHSE from the perspective of hypertension control. The
PHSE program facilitates patients seeing the same doctor regularly for management of
hypertension. Evidence from the USA shows that the rates of controlled hypertension were
significantly higher among persons who visited the same facility for their health care or saw
the same provider [17]. This study aims to identify differences in hypertension control
between patients managed by the PHSE program and those not managed by the program by
using data from the CHSIS.

Based on the studies cited above and others, 12 factors in three categories are considered as
determinants of hypertension control in this study. The first category consists of sociodemographic factors influencing adherence to medication, including age, gender,
geographical region, health insurance, financial difficulties, and education level. The second
category includes disease-related factors, such as smoking, drinking, exercise, blood glucose
levels, and the presence of complications and co-morbidities. Hypertension management,
denoting medical support and follow-up by a specialist, is the factor considered as the effect
of the PHSE program.
This study measures the impact of the PHSE program by comparing the degree of
hypertension control among patients managed by the program and those that are outside the
program, using the results of the CHSIS. It assesses the contribution of program management
to hypertension control while considering other relevant factors suggested by the literature.

2. Methodology
Source of data and sampling
The CHSIS used in this study was conducted in 2014 by the China National Health
Development Research Center (CNHDRC) and was funded by the National Health and Family
Planning Commission of the People’s Republic of China (NHFPC) and the National Natural
Science Foundation (No. 71303173). The primary objective of the survey was to monitor the
implementation of primary care reform in China in chosen pilot areas, to draw experiences to
promote the integration of the healthcare system, and to disseminate these experiences across
the nation. Of the 32 provinces in China, 17 were chosen to participate in the survey based on
their representativeness and willingness to participate. These provinces cover the eastern,
central and western parts of China considering the rural-urban divide. The basic administrative
unit of the financial and tax system in China is the rural county or urban township, so one
rural county and one urban district were chosen from a selected city in each province. From
the 17 rural counties and 17 urban districts, 10,865 urban households with 30,924 dwellers
and 9,912 rural households with 31,173 dwellers were selected by stratified multi-stage
sampling resulting in a total of 20,777 households comprising 62,097 persons. Fig 1 provides
more detail on the sampling procedure for the survey.
Fig 1. Selection of study participants.
The CHSIS was carried out using face-to-face interviews by undergraduates from medical
universities trained by the personnel from CNHDRC. The questionnaire used in the survey
was based on the 5th National Health Interview Survey of Households of China conducted in
2013 [18], adjusted to concentrate on primary health care.
In the CHSIS, a total of 9,607 respondents (5155 urban and 4452 rural) aged 15 years and
over in the survey answered “Yes” when asked “Have you ever been diagnosed with
hypertension by a doctor?”. These respondents form the basis of the analysis in this study.

Indicators and data method
According to the criteria for public health service delivery developed by the NHFPC for the
PHSE, primary health care facilities need to screen people aged 35 years or over for
hypertension, and once the person is diagnosed, he or she should be taken into standard
management. It requires that patients be seen regularly by a community health care
professional at least four times a year, to have their blood pressure measured, to be checked
for any signs of deterioration in risk factors, and to obtain advice on behavior and medication.

The question “Have any primary health care workers provided advice for your hypertension
control during the past three months?” was specifically designed to evaluate hypertension
management under the PHSE program. If the answer was “yes”, the patient was considered
as being part of the disease management program of the PHSE, and if the answer was “no”,
the patient was considered as not being under the disease management program of the PHSE.
Patients were regarded as having hypertension controlled, if they answered “Yes” to the
question “Was your blood pressure normal when it was last measured?”. They were
considered as not controlled if the answer was “no” or “not clear”.
Other questions addressed demographic characteristics (residence, gender, age, number of
household participants), socio-economic status (annual disposable income of the household,
health insurance, education level), disease-related health behaviors (smoking, drinking and
exercise), self-reported wellbeing and compliance with medication. The questions used to
measure these factors are listed in Table 1 and with more details provided in the
Supplementary Material (S1Table).
The ethics committee of the China National Health Development Research Centre reviewed
and approved the present study, and the written informed consent was obtained from each
participant before data collection.

Analytical method
A Pearson chi-square (χ2) test was used to compare the managed and unmanaged hypertensive
patients for each factor. Results were considered significant if P＜0.05. As age and wellbeing
were continuous variables, a T-test was used in comparing differences with the significance
level also set at P＜0.05 (Table 2).

To further analyze the impact of the program, a logistic regression analysis model was used
to identify the role of factors in hypertension control, with the dependent variable being a
binary variable (1=non-control of hypertension). To make the variables suitable for the
logistic regression model, most variables from the survey questionnaire were transformed into
binary or ordinal form. The binary variables were hukou or residence (urban or rural), gender
(female or male), disease management (yes or no), and drinking alcohol (yes or no). The
ordinal variables were income, education level, health insurance, medication, smoking, and
exercise, with the first group in each variable set as reference. Age and well-being were
included in the regression analysis as continuous variables. The analysis was performed using
Stata (version 14).
A likelihood ratio test was used to assess the significance of any interaction effects between
hypertension management and the other factors influencing hypertension control. Household
random effects and city random effects were also checked where there was a significant cluster
effect within households, but not significant within each city (province). The quantitative

effect of each impact factor was analyzed for hypertension control. The impact of management
was estimated using a main effects logistic regression model with an adjustment for
correlation within households (household cluster effects). The 95% confidence interval of
predicted probability is also shown.

3. Results
Demographic characteristics
Key demographic characteristics of managed and unmanaged survey participants are
described in Table 2. The overall level of uncontrolled hypertension was markedly lower in
the managed group of survey participants (22.4% versus 31.1%). The pronounced difference
in uncontrolled hypertension could not be attributed to population differences between
management groups, as both groups were similar with respect to those demographic
characteristics which are known to influence hypertension control. There were strong
similarities in compliance with medication (85.4% versus 78.1% in managed and unmanaged
groups respectively), gender (46.0% versus 48.7%), age (63.5 versus 62.8 years), wellbeing
(70.9% versus 70.1%) and regular alcohol intake (11.8% versus 12.8%). Trends were also
similar in proportions across categories of education, income, exercise, smoking and the
number of participants per household. The statistical differences between management groups
that were detected for most of these variables arose not from meaningful disparities, but from
the large sample size (N=9,607), which made tests of significance sensitive to relatively minor
differences. More marked differences between management groups were observed between
categories of hukou, type of medical insurance, and geographical regions.

Main factors selected (regression model selection)
A more accurate comparison of uncontrolled hypertension levels in managed and unmanaged
groups was performed using multivariate regression modelling to adjust for any population
imbalances in the key characteristics that were listed in Table 2. The selection of independent
variables for inclusion in the regression models is outlined in Table 3.

geographical regions (χ2(33)=78.2, p<0.001), which indicated that the management program
was not equally effective in all regions.
Insurance (χ2(5)=4.4, p=0.496) and Hukou (χ2(1)=2.4, p=0.121), which denote social security
and urban rural differences, respectively, were not significant predictor of hypertension
control. It may reflect that the EPHS program had played a role in equalization from the two
perspective.
Random effects for 7,867 households (1.2 respondents/household on average) were strong and
highly significant (χ2(1)= 423.8, p<0.001), suggesting a tendency towards similar levels of
hypertension control within the same household. No significant clustering by provinces was
detected in the data.

Main effects in hypertension control
The logistic regression results show that the estimated proportion of patients with uncontrolled
hypertension was 27.7%, or 8.6 percentage points lower among participants in the
management program (22.4% versus 31.0%, Table 4).

The average effect of Management was estimated from the Main Effects logistic regression model of
Uncontrolled Hypertension.

Given the strong emphasis of the management program on the importance of regular
compliance, at least some of the effect of management was expected to be due to improved
compliance among managed patients. The results show that the effect of management was
independent of compliance in the surveyed population, with no significant interaction (Table
4) or mediation effects (Table 5). To test for mediation, the compliance term was removed
from the main effects regression model. The impact of management was not changed
substantively in the absence of the compliance term (Table 5). Management was associated
with a reduction of 8.6 percentage points (95% CI: -11.1 to -6.1) in uncontrolled hypertension
if compliance was included in the model; without adjustment for compliance the reduction
was 9.6 percentage points (95%CI: -12.1 to -7.0).

The impact of management was compared in two Main Effects models: in one model Compliance was
included as an independent variable, while in the second model the Compliance term was excluded.

The effects of most other independent variables were in line with expectations (Table 4).
Predictors of improved hypertension control included compliance, wellbeing, education,
income, age and three or more exercise sessions per week, while smoking over 20 cigarettes
per day was associated with reduced control. Predicted trends for wellbeing and age are shown
in Fig 2 and S2 Fig. Levels of disease control also varied among regions (Table 4), with the
most favorable outcomes predicted for Xicheng (8.9% uncontrolled hypertension), Yunhe
(10.1%), Runzhou (10.1%), Changning (11.2%), Wuhou (14.0%), Yijiang (13.6%), Pudong
(12.5%), Shengzhou (13.4%) and Xinjin (11.5%). The highest levels of uncontrolled
hypertension were in Keshiketeng (52.7%) and Yinan (44.2%).
The significant inverse association between uncontrolled hypertension and age points to poor
hypertension control in younger people. The trend is consistent with previous studies in both
China and the USA, which showed that younger adults were less likely to be treated for
hypertension than older adults. The residual effect may be due to a more general failure among
younger people to seek medical care, including treatment for comorbidities, which may cause
hypertension, such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease [19,20] (see Fig 2-1 and Fig 2-2).

Regional impact of management
The significant interaction between management and regions indicates that the benefit of the
management program is not the same in all areas (χ2 [33] = 78.2, p<0.001, Table 3). Estimates
for regional management effects are shown in Fig 3 and S3 Table. In sixteen regions, there
were significantly lower rates of uncontrolled hypertension among managed patients, while
in eighteen regions, no difference was detected between management groups. The strongest
impact of management was observed in Wuhou and Shengzhou, with respective rate ratios of
0.19 and 0.20 (Fig 3 and S3 Table). Predicted difference proportions of Uncontrolled
Hypertension between Management groups were derived from the Interaction Effects
regression model (Table 2). The effect of Management in each location is indicated by black
circles; vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Estimates tagged with open circles
mark those regions where no IMS systems have been established. Management rate ratio
estimates for each region are listed in S3 Table and regional availability of IMS is shown in

Establishment of information management systems may
contribute to regional differences in the effectiveness of the
management program
Two important factors may account for the variability in regional management effects. One is
the presence of an information management system (IMS), which is important according to
the specification of hypertension management. We explored the possible link between
regional variability in the impact of the management program and the presence of an
established IMS. Regions with an established IMS are listed in S4 Table. Fig 3 shows that
management rate ratios for these regions tended to cluster near the value of 1.00, which is the
assumption of no effect under the null hypothesis. Management had no discernible impact on
hypertension control in regions with no IMS (RR=0.93; 95% CI: 0.76-1.12), while in regions
with established IMS, management had a strong impact (0.68, 95%CI: 0.62-0.75). Established
IMS accounted for approximately 10% of the variability in regional management effects, as
the change in deviance for the interaction term (IMS x management) represented 10% of the
change in deviance for (regions x management) interaction terms (χ2=78.2, p<0.001).
The other possible factor is government funding, which has been well-reported in the literature
in China [21-23]. However, in this study, no correlation was detected between regional
management effects and government healthcare funding (S5 Fig). Related reported data on
government funding for primary care and for total healthcare [22] is provided in S4 Table.

4. Discussion
This study examined the relationship between hypertension control and disease management
under the PHSE program from care utilizers’ perspectives and found that providing
management of hypertension significantly improved hypertension control.
Much of the literature on control of hypertension gives prominent roles to socio-economic
factors, such as education, income and insurance, while taking healthcare accessibility and
availability into account [6,23]. In this study, the above factors were not the main ones for
hypertension control. Multi-regression analysis indicates that neither insurance scheme nor
Hukou (which denotes urban and rural character of the surveyed hypertensives) were main
factors for hypertension control. Such a result may imply that the EPHS program had played
a role in equalization between urban and rural as well as that among different insurance
schemes, which was like previous studies [24].
This study reveals major differences in the effectiveness of hypertension control among
regions in China, which could guide policy makers and implementers in identifying where the
health system needs strengthening. There are a number of possible reasons for these regional
differences. According to the disease management specifications of hypertension from the
PHSE issued by the National Health Commission (previously known as the National Health
and Family Planning Commission) [25,26], one likely explanation is the efficiency of the
integration of the management program with other medical services. Such integration is
important in the treatment of patients who do not respond to medication. Appropriate referral
for more intensive testing and treatment in a hospital or a specialist clinic is particularly
16

important in the treatment of more severe hypertension or secondary hypertension, caused by
diabetes, kidney disease or heart disease [20]. The ability to coordinate referrals as well as
patient follow-up requires the establishment of effective information management systems
(IMS) and government funding of the primary care system. This study has shown that the
presence of an information management systems is a significant factor explaining regional
differences in hypertension control. If some of the impact of management were mediated
through IMS, it would be through providing improved access to advanced treatment for
patients with severe or secondary hypertension. It follows that an effective system of referral
can only be part of the solution and that more intensive treatment for severe or secondary
hypertension must also be made available. It is possible that regional differences in the
availability of more intensive treatment for patients with uncontrolled hypertension could
account for some of the remaining differences in regional management effects.
Another possible reason for the variation of impact in different regions may be government
funding. From international experience, investment by the government in an essential
healthcare package is an important measure to address market failure in achieving the goal of
universal health care [7,27]. In this study, a significant relationship between government
funding and hypertension control was not detected. However, many studies in China discuss
the impact of government funding on the PHSE program. In 2011, Chen Li et al. demonstrated
that for the PHSE program, the financial investment could not match local responsibilities and
roles of the central and local government were not clearly defined in funding and expenditure
[20]. Such differences guide the need to further detect the regional differences of government
investment, financial systems and expenditure on public health equalization programs at the
primary care facilities level [28].
The failure to detect mediation effects could be explained by similarly high levels of
compliance in both managed and unmanaged patients (85.4% and 78.1% respectively, Table
2). With high compliance rates among unmanaged patients, there was little opportunity for
further improvement. In a different population with lower compliance rates outside the
management program, we expect the effect of management to be more pronounced than
estimated in this study because it would also include the contribution of improved medication
use.
Younger people in the current study were also less likely to persist with medical treatment:
they were less likely to participate in the management program and to comply with medication
than older people. The finding of an inverse relationship between uncontrolled hypertension
and age is not new [17,18]. It is noted that the inverse association between uncontrolled
hypertension and age was detected in the regression model despite adjustment for
management and compliance, which is consistent with the 2017 study by Li et al. [29]. Some
younger people are part of a floating population and tend not to consider hypertension as a
risk [30,31] which may contribute to poorer control among younger people. In China, the
“floating population” of 250 million people mainly consists of young people and they suffer
the highest illiteracy in China. As well, the health insurance system in China system is based
at the local government level, and the floating population derives little benefit from it [31, 32].
As the survey was conducted by interviews, answers from respondents of hypertension
management and control may not be as accurate as diagnosis by a health professional,
although definitions such as hypertension control followed WHO guidelines. The findings of
low management and control rates for young patients requires additional research, taking other
social factors into account.

The PHSE program delivered through community health organizations has played a
significant role in improving the control of hypertension and improved service delivery
equalization on hypertension management between urban and rural and among different
social-economic groups in China since its introduction in 2009. Based on a previous study
[14], it is estimated that 7.31 million more patients received hypertension control from the
PHSE in 2013. Patient outcomes have been improved by the program, independent of the
degree of medication compliance, and demographic and socioeconomic differences, which
reflected that equalization of service delivery was demonstrated. But the impact of the
program on the control of hypertension varies across different regions in China and this is
detected to be linked to the presence of a functioning health information system independent
of the level of investment in health by the central government. This suggests that functioning
health information systems be established in regions where they are not currently present and
established systems be further strengthened to enhance the outcomes from the PHSE program.
Lastly, implementation of the PHSE program needs to address the requirements of younger
patients to improve the management of hypertension control to achieve higher levels of control.
