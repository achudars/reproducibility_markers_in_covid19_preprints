THC IMPAIRS VISUAL WORKING MEMORY

Abstract
With the sharply increasing prevalence of cannabis use and availability, there is an
urgent need to identify cognitive impairments related to its use. It is widely believed that
cannabis, or its main psychoactive component D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), impairs
working memory, i.e., the ability to temporarily hold information in mind. However, our
review of the literature yielded surprisingly little empirical support for an effect of THC or
cannabis on working memory. We thus conducted a study with 3 main goals: (1)
quantify the effect of THC on visual working memory in a well-powered sample (2) test
the potential role of cognitive effects (mind wandering and metacognition) in disrupting
working memory, and (3) demonstrate how insufficient sample size and task duration
reduce the likelihood of detecting a drug effect. We conducted two double-blind,
counterbalanced experiments in which healthy adults (N=23, 23) performed a sensitive
and validated visual working memory task (the “Discrete Whole-Report task”, 90 trials)
after administration of THC (7.5 and/or 15 mg oral) or placebo. We also assessed selfreported ‘mind wandering’ (Exp 1) and metacognitive accuracy about ongoing task
performance (Exp 2). THC impaired working memory performance (d = .65), increased
mind wandering (Exp 1), and decreased metacognitive accuracy about task
performance (Exp 2). Thus, our findings indicate that THC does impair visual working
memory, and that this impairment may be related to both increased mind-\ wandering
and decreased monitoring of task performance. Finally, we used a downsampling
procedure to illustrate the effects of task length and sample size on power to detect the
acute effect of THC on working memory.

THC IMPAIRS VISUAL WORKING MEMORY

Introduction
Cannabis and its main psychoactive constituent, D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
are widely believed to impair executive functioning needed to plan and achieve goals
(for review, see 1). In particular, THC is believed to impair working memory, the mental
workspace used to hold information “in mind” that is needed for everyday behaviors
such as driving and problem solving[2,3]. Disruptions to working memory can thus
disrupt ongoing behavior and lead to potentially negative outcomes, from the innocuous
(e.g., forgetting that your turn-signal is on) to the dire (e.g., hitting the cyclist you forgot
was in your blind-spot). Thus, understanding the acute effects of THC on working
memory and cognition is of critical importance for public health and safety.
Despite the popular belief that THC impairs working memory, here we reviewed
papers published on this topic from 1970 to 2019, and found that more than 70% of
studies using the most commonly used working memory tasks failed to detect an effect
of the drug (p ³ .05). Thus, it has been surprisingly difficult to demonstrate the effects of
THC on working memory in controlled studies [4–9]. This finding is especially notable
given the bias toward publishing ‘positive’ results [10–12], which should inflate the
relative proportion of positive effects in the literature. This lack of empirical support for
impairment of working memory after THC could indicate either that the drug truly has
little effect, or that previous studies were limited, either because of insufficient sample
sizes or insensitivity of the tasks. As cannabis and THC become more widely used for
both medical and nonmedical purposes, it is critical to understand how the drug affects
working memory and cognition.
The current study had three key goals which together test whether visual working
memory is disrupted by THC, and if so, why and to what degree it is disrupted. First, we
sought to characterize the effects of THC on working memory using a higher than
typical number of trials and larger sample size (90 trials, combined n = 46). We
measured working memory performance using a sensitive visual working memory task
(“Discrete Whole Report”). In this task participants view 6 colored squares, attempt to
remember them across a blank delay, and then freely recall the color-location pairing of
all 6 squares [13,14]. Second, we tested visual working memory performance in relation
to other ongoing cognitive processes, specifically increased mind wandering (Exp 1)
and decreased metacognitive accuracy of task performance (Exp 2). Whereas mind
wandering and decreased awareness of mind wandering are known to occur during
nicotine withdrawal [15] and alcohol intoxication [16], little is known about the effect of
THC on mind wandering during ongoing task performance. Finally, we examined
previous studies on the effect of THC on working memory to determine whether
previous failures to detect effects could be related to insufficient power. To this end, we
combined our literature review with a down-sampling procedure on our own, wellpowered sample (achieved power > .99) and found that with comparable sample sizes
and task length to those used in the literature (e.g., 5 minute task, n = 10-15), we would
have had insufficient power to reliably detect the impairment (d = .65) of working
memory that we observed. Thus, we conclude that visual working memory performance
is impaired under the influence of THC, and that this impairment may be related to mind
wandering and poorer monitoring of ongoing task performance. We further conclude

that the majority of prior work has been underpowered to detect the effects of THC on
working memory performance. Such power issues are likely typical of the literature, and
more work is urgently needed to accurately quantify the effects of THC on other aspects
of cognition.
Results
Subjective and physiological measures
THC produced its expected effects on physiological and subjective measures.
THC (15 mg) increased heart rate, including at the time of the working memory test in
both Exp 1, t(21) = 3.55, p = .002, d = .76, and Exp 2, F(2,44) = 12.16, p = 6.3x10-5.
Only 1 dose (15 mg) was used in Exp 1. In Exp 2 (15 mg , 7.5 mg), there was a linear
effect of dose (p = 2.3x10-5), but only the high dose was significantly different from
placebo (high vs. placebo p = 1.6x10-4, low vs. placebo p = .25). The drug did not affect
systolic or diastolic blood pressure (p > .3). See SI Results for tables of all values. THC
also increased scores on the “marijuana scale” of the ARCI (p < .001), and the “Feel” (p
< .001), “Like” (p £ .005), “Dislike” (p £ .03), and “High” (p < .001) questions of the DEQ
(Bonferroni-corrected for the 5 DEQ measures). The drug increased “Want more”
ratings of the DEQ (p = .002; p = .197), and VAS measures “Sociable” and “Friendly” (p
< .05, Bonferroni-corrected for 13 VAS measures) in Exp 1, but not Exp 2. See SI
Results for tables of all values.
Mean working memory performance
We assessed visual working memory performance using the Discrete WholeReport task [13,14]. In this task, participants briefly view (200 ms) an array of six brightly
colored squares and remember the colors and locations of these squares across a
blank delay (1,000 ms). At test, they report the color of all six squares. Working memory
performance is measured as the average number of correctly recalled color-location
pairings (out of 6) on each trial. THC impaired working memory performance relative to
placebo in both Exp 1 (Fig 1A) and Exp 2 (Fig 1B). In Exp 1, participants correctly
reported an average of 3.11 (SD = .49) items in the placebo condition and 2.77 (SD =
.50) items in the 15 mg THC condition, t(22) = 3.72, p = .001, d = .78. In Exp 2,
participants correctly reported an average of 3.02 (SD = .53) items in the placebo
condition, 2.84 (SD = .44) items in the 7.5 mg THC condition, and 2.78 (SD = .54) items
in the 15 mg THC condition, F(1.52,33.42) = 4.58, p = .026, hp2 = .17*. Although
polynomial contrasts revealed a linear effect of dose in Exp 2 (p = .005), only the high
dose was significantly different from placebo (placebo vs. high, p = .018; placebo vs.
low, p = .07).
In a separate analysis, we combined the working memory performance data for
Placebo vs. 15 mg THC in Exp 1 and Exp 2 , and observed the same main effect of
THC on working memory performance (Fig 1C). A mixed ANOVA with within-subjects

Greenhouse-Geisser corrected values are reported whenever the assumption of
sphericity is violated.

Experiment, F(1,44) = .52, p = .48, hp2 = .01, so this combination of experiments is
justified. This combination of experiments yields a total sample size of 46 subjects and a
robust effect of Drug on working memory performance, Fig 1C, t(45) = 4.43, p =
5.94x10-5, d = .65. With this larger sample size, we quantified reliability, the effect of
experimental block, and the effects of response number on both accuracy and response
time. Task reliability (even-odd correlation) was excellent during both the placebo (r =
.91) and the THC (r = .90) conditions, and individual differences in performance were
preserved across the THC and Placebo conditions, as shown by a positive correlation
(Fig 2A; r = .63, p = 3.20x10-6, 95% CI [.41, .78]).

combined (C; N=46). Here and elsewhere, violin plots show the distribution of
participants, black error bars represent 1 SEM, and transparent gray lines show
individual participants. THC significantly reduced the number of remembered items in
the 15 mg conditions.
Changes in working memory performance across experimental blocks and
individual responses
To determine whether the effect of THC on working memory performance was
related to a decline in effort or task engagement over the course of the experiment, we
compared performance across the three blocks of the experiment (30 trials per block).
The difference between THC and placebo scores was constant over time (Fig 2B). A
repeated measures ANOVA with factors Drug and Block revealed no main effect of
Block, F(2,90) = 2.69, p = .074, hp2 = .06, and no interaction between Drug and Block,
F(1.73,77.98) = 1.60, p = .210, hp2 = .03.
To determine whether the effect of THC on working memory was related to
careless responding and a speed-accuracy trade-off, we examined response time and
accuracy for each response in the trial. Recall, participants were shown 6 items on each
trial, and made 6 responses to report the remembered color of all items. If participants

were simply more careless at responding in the THC condition, then they may have
responded quickly and with poor accuracy. Thus, if the THC-related working memory
decrement is driven by a speed-accuracy tradeoff, we should observe faster response
times for trials where participants showed lower accuracy. The empirical data did not
support a speed-accuracy tradeoff account. Accuracy was overall lower in the Drug
condition, particularly for the first three responses. There was a main effect of Drug,
F(1,45) = 19.64, p = 5.94x10-5, hp2 = .30, a main effect of Response Number,
F(2.44,109.58) = 909.07, p = 5.50x10-73, hp2 = .95, and an interaction between Drug and
Response Number, F(3.68,165.62) = 4.38, p = .003, hp2 = .09. However, poorer
accuracy was not associated with faster response times. Instead, response times were
actually slower overall. A repeated measures ANVOA examining response times
showed a main effect of Drug, F(1,45) = 21.68, p = .014, hp2 = .13, a main effect of
Response Number, F(1.13,50.99) = 1026.79, p = 1.08x10-36, hp2 = .96, and a significant
interaction between Response Number and Drug, F(1.13,50.64) = 11.61, p = 8.68x10-4,
hp2 = .21.

were overall less accurate for THC versus placebo, particularly early in the trial. (D)
Cumulative response time as a function of response number and drug indicates that

Effects of THC on mind wandering during the task (Exp 1).
In Exp 1 only, we used “thought probes” to assay the contents of participants’
thoughts while performing the working memory task. Participants were asked after a
random 20% of trials about the contents of their current thoughts, which were
categorized as, ‘On-Task’, ‘Mind Wandering’ or ‘Zoning Out’ (Fig 3A). THC significantly
reduced reports of being On Task t(22) = 5.08, p = 4.38x10-5, d = 1.06. and increased
frequency of both Mind Wandering t(22) = 4.42, p = 2.15x10-4, d = .92, and Zoning Out,
t(22) = 2.13, p = .044, d = .45. In a separate ANOVA looking at the drug’s effects on
type of mind wandering (Past, Future, Other, or “I Don’t Know”), there was no
interaction between Drug and Mind Wandering Type, F(3,48) = 2.49, p = .07, hp2 = .135.

Effect of THC on metacognitive accuracy (Exp 2).
In Exp 2 only, we examined subjects’ ability to accurately monitor ongoing task
performance (i.e. metacognitive accuracy), by providing confidence ratings for each
response. On each trial, participants made binary confidence judgments (i.e. “confident”
or “guess”) about each of their 6 responses. To measure metacognitive accuracy, we
calculated the correlation between the number of correct items on each trial and the
number of confident responses on each trial (separately for each individual using
Spearman’s r). Higher, positive correlation values correspond with more accurate

monitoring of task performance (e.g., the participant got N correct and reported N
confident responses). We tested whether metacognitive accuracy declined as a function
of Drug. A repeated measures ANOVA with factors Drug and Dose revealed a main
effect of Drug, F(2,44) = 3.43, p = .04, hp2 = .14. Consistent with the impairment to
overall performance, post-hoc t-tests for each dose revealed that this measure of
metaknowledge was impaired for the high dose (p = .03) but not the low dose (p = .07).
Literature review and power analysis
We conducted a review of acute effects on working memory performance (SI
Results). Here, we focus on studies using a single task that is routinely administered,
the Digit Span (Forward and/or Backward). We found 15 publications [17–31] with a
total of 57 experimental conditions which examine the acute effect of THC on Digit
Span. Although the Digit Span task has been widely used, we found that the drug had
no effect on this task in more than 70% (73.68%) of the conditions tested (Fig 4A). A
lack of sensitivity was evident for both Forward and Backward span, as well as other
working memory tasks, such as Spatial N-Back (SI Results). The lack of effect was
observed in studies using a range of doses including higher doses than what was used
here, and multiple modes of administration (Table S1). The apparently weak effect of
THC on working memory could indicate that the drug does not affect performance but,
alternatively, it could reflect a lack of power in most prior studies. Although it was not
possible to calculate effect sizes for the reviewed studies, we were able to demonstrate
the effects of task time and sample size on power new empirical data.
To test whether the distribution of p-values in the literature review was related to
insufficient statistical power or a lack of an effect of THC on working memory
performance, we performed a down-sampling procedure [32] on the data from Exp 2 (15
mg THC; n = 46, trials = 90). When we reduced the sample size and task length of our
dataset to match those in the literature, we could nearly perfectly predict the distribution
of p-values that was observed in the literature.
With 46 subjects and 90 trials per subject, the achieved power (1 - b) for our
main effect of THC on working memory performance was in excess of 0.99. Fig 1B
reveals the results of iterative down-sampling of this data (e.g. randomly choosing N
subjects and T trials, calculating power). Each cell in this figure contains the average
power for 250 random iterations. When down-sampling to a typical sample size and task
duration for the literature (e.g. 15 subjects, 5 min task time), power plummets to only
0.47. In Figs 4C and 4D, we have plotted the distribution of p-values for Digit Span
studies above and below the median sample size found in the literature. To compare
predictions from our down-sampling procedure, we chose the cell from Fig 4B that most
closely matched the number of subjects (5 subjects, 15 subjects), and then discretized
the p-value outcomes for each of the 250 iterations (<.001, <.01, <.05, or n.s.). The digit
span task takes approximately 4 – 5 minutes, corresponding to approximately 15 trials
of the whole-report task. As shown in Fig 4, with 5 minutes of task time and fewer
subjects per “experiment”, we obtain distributions of p-values that are nearly identical to
those in the empirical literature (Fig 4C, 4D).

Discussion
The present study demonstrated that single, moderate doses of THC impair
working memory, when tested under rigorous, placebo-controlled, double-blind
conditions. THC, the main psychoactive constituent in cannabis, is commonly thought to
impair working memory, but this effect has been difficult to demonstrate in controlled
studies. We review previous studies assessing the effects of THC, and conclude that

the failures to detect effects were most likely due to inadequate statistical power. Using
a well-powered sample (combined n = 46, [1-b] > .99), we found that single doses of
THC reliably impair visual working memory, and further that the drug increases selfreports of mind wandering and decreases meta-awareness of task performance.
Here, we demonstrated that single moderate doses of THC impair visual working
memory in human observers. Future work is needed to understand the mechanisms
underlying this effect of THC on working memory deficits, the effects of repeated
exposure to the drug, exposure at a young age, and effects in people with clinical
disorders. For example, disruption to working memory is a key cognitive deficit in people
with schizophrenia [33], and this deficit is hypothesized to be related to disruptions of
the endocannabinoid system [34], more specifically to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC)[35–37], but see [38]. The DLPFC is laden with CB1 receptors, the primary
target of THC, and is a critical component of WM maintenance [39–41]. Studies of the
neural mechanisms underlying WM disruption under the effects of THC may thus
provide a reversible demonstration of WM deficits related to disruptions of the
endocannabinoid system.
Subjective thought probes revealed that THC increased rates of mind wandering
(Exp 1) and decreased accuracy of performance monitoring (Exp 2). To our knowledge,
our work provides the first demonstration of THC’s effects on mind wandering during a
concurrent cognitive task. These finding are consistent with prior work on THC,
including task-independent reports of mind wandering in structured interviews [42,43],
failure to de-activate the default mode network during task performance [44], and
decreased error monitoring [45]. Similar to the effects of nicotine cravings [15] and
alcohol [16], THC appears to increase mind wandering and decrease awareness of task
performance. These broad effects on conscious experience are likely to drive
performance decrements in a broad range of cognitive tasks.
Choice of working memory task
One major difference between our study and prior studies assessing effects of
THC on working memory performance is the specific task used. The tasks most
commonly used in previous studies are the digit span task or a spatial n-back task. Our
down-sampling analysis suggests that the effect size of working memory disruption in
these tasks is similar to that observed in the present study (as we could accurately
predict the digit span task’s p-value distribution when matching sample size and task
length), but those tasks may not be best suited to detect drug-induced impairments. We
will briefly comment on our choice of task.
Although simple span and n-back tasks are quick and widely recognized, they
may have some disadvantages for measuring deficits to working memory storage. Most
critically, based on our down-sampling analysis, we believe that the very short task
length of digit span (forward and backward conditions, <5 min) critically reduces its
sensitivity. In addition, simple span tasks (e.g., the forward digit span condition) load
onto a general working memory factor at the latent level [46] relatively weakly, and
typically do not predict individual differences in general fluid intelligence [47–51], but
also see [52]. N-back tasks correlate somewhat weakly with other working memory

tasks [53–55] and have relatively poor statistical reliability [51], potentially making it
difficult to detect effects across treatment conditions. On the other hand, n-back tasks
still load well onto a general WM factor at the latent level [46] and are particularly useful
for investigating the executive function component of WM (vs. the storage component).
Here, we used the “Discrete Whole-Report” task, a visuospatial working memory
task in which participants encode many items simultaneously and recall them at test.
This and similar visuospatial working memory tasks are reliable [32,56], correlate well
with other measures of working memory [46,47], and predict individual differences in
general fluid intelligence [47]. Thus, we believe that visuospatial working memory tasks
(i.e., whole-report, partial-report, and change detection) are well-suited for
characterizing deficits in the ability to temporarily store information in mind. In addition,
the short trial length of these tasks makes them well-suited for future neural studies that
will help to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying THC’s effects on
working memory performance, and the relatively simple nature of these tasks allows for
direct comparisons in performance of humans and non-human primates [57].
Limitations and implications for future studies of THC and cognition
There in an intense public interest in the effects of cannabis on cognition and an
urgent need for practical information that will guide use. Our findings offer important
new leads on how the drug affects memory, but the studies also had limitations and
suggest future avenues for research. First, we were able to test working memory at only
one, relatively late time-point after oral consumption of a THC capsule (160 – 220
minutes), and at two moderate doses. It will be important to characterize the effects of
THC on working memory performance over the full time-course of the drug, and,
importantly when it is taken at higher doses and by different routes of administration
(especially smoked and vaped). Second, we need more information on the severity of
working memory disruption and the extent to which the effect depends on initial
performance. Although the effect we observed was relatively large (d = .65), this effect
is smaller than, for example, normal variation in working memory performance across
individuals. The behavioral performance difference between the placebo and drug
conditions was 0.29 items, but the difference between the top- and bottom-half of
individuals within the placebo condition was .80 items. Further, the effects of the drug
may be especially pronounced in certain at-risk populations, including those with initially
poor working memory performance.
Our literature search revealed the importance of statistical power in studies of
THC on cognition. Here, we used one relatively long task (~30 minutes, 90 trials). In
contrast, many earlier studies used several shorter tasks (e.g. ten 3-minute tasks),
presumably to assess a range of potential deficits. However, because task time and
statistical power have direct tradeoffs, this approach may miss important effects. Similar
problems of inadequate power may exist in other studies of effects of drugs on working
memory and other aspects of cognition. Thus, we recommend that longer tasks be used

Methods
Participants
Healthy occasional cannabis users, aged 18-35, were recruited for the study.
Screening included a physical examination, an electrocardiogram, and a semistructured interview by a clinical psychologist. Exclusion criteria included any current
Axis I DSM-IV disorder including substance dependence, current use of >5 cigarettes
per day, history of psychosis or mania, less than a high school education, lack of
English fluency, a body mass index outside 19-33 kg/m2, high blood pressure
(>140/90), abnormal electrocardiogram, daily use of any medication other than birth
control, pregnancy, or lactating. Participants were eligible if they reported having used
cannabis at least 4 times, but no more than 100 times (Exp 1) or daily (Exp 2). We
enrolled 24 participants in Exp 1 (12 female; M = 23.0 years old, SD = 3.6) and 24 in
Exp 2 (12 female; M = 23.4 years old, SD = 4.3), but one participant was excluded from
each study because of poor behavioral performance (>3 SDs below the mean).
Procedures were approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board, and
participants provided written, informed consent.
Drug
THC (15 mg Exp 1; 7.5 or 15 mg Exp 2; Marinolâ; Solvay Pharmaceuticals) was
placed in opaque, size 00 capsules with dextrose filler. Placebo capsules contained only
dextrose. These doses produce reliable subjective and cardiovascular effects without
adverse effects [19,58].
Design
Both experiments used double-blind, within-subjects, counterbalanced designs.
In both experiments, sessions were conducted at least 1 week apart, in a laboratory
setting. Subjects were screened for recent drug use and pregnancy before each
session. The drugs (THC 15 mg or placebo in Exp 1; placebo 7.5 and 15 mg in Exp 2)
were administered in mixed order under double-blind conditions. On each session
participants performed a discrete whole-report working memory task [13,14,59] and
completed questionnaires regarding drug effects and self-reports of their level of
concentration (Exp 1) or their level of performance (Exp 2). In Exp 1, participants also
performed a long-term memory task that was reported by Doss and colleagues [60]. In
Exp 2, participants also performed a cognitive test battery that was reported by Pabon
and colleagues [61].
Procedures
Pre-session. During an orientation session subjects received instructions,
signed a consent form, and practiced the tasks. They were instructed to consume their
normal amount of caffeine and nicotine, but to abstain from alcohol, prescription drugs
(except contraceptives), over-the-counter-drugs, cannabis, and other illicit drugs for at
least 48 hours before session. Participants were informed that they would be tested for
recent drug use at the beginning of each session, and positive tests would result in
rescheduling or dismissal. Finally, they were advised to get their normal amounts of

sleep and to not eat for 2 hours prior to each experimental session. To minimize
expectancy effects, participants were informed that they may receive a stimulant,
sedative, cannabinoid, or placebo during the sessions.
Experimental sessions. At the beginning of each laboratory visit, subjects
provided breath and urine samples for breath alcohol level (Alco-sensor III,
Intoximeters, St. Louis, MO), a urine drug test (ToxCup, Branan Medical Co., Irvine,
CA), and a pregnancy test (females only; Aimstrip, Craig Medical, Vista, CA). Those
testing positive were rescheduled or dropped from the study. Baseline cardiovascular
and mood measures were also taken, and participants consumed the capsule (placebo
or THC, double-blind). During the first 120 min, participants relaxed with magazines and
music (but were not allowed to eat, sleep, work, or browse the internet) while the drug
was absorbed. Cardiovascular and mood measures were taken approximately every 30
minutes during this baseline absorption period and at multiple points during the
cognitive testing period.
Cognitive testing began at 120 min. Before performing the working memory task,
participants completed other cognitive tests. In Exp 1, participants completed long-term
memory tasks for stimuli they had encoded 48 hours earlier (SI Methods) as previously
reported in [60]. In Exp 2, participants completed a series of cognitive tasks on a
desktop computer and on a mobile phone [61]. The working memory task was
performed at around 160 min post-capsule in Exp 1 (M = 159.4, SD = 14.5, Range =
[126,193]) and around 220 min post-capsule in Exp 2 (exact time not recorded).
Physiological and Subjective Measures
Heart rate and blood pressure were measured with portable monitors in Exp 1
(A&D Medical/Life Source, San Jose, CA) and Exp 2 (Omron 10 Plus, Omron
Healthcare). Cardiovascular measures were taken at baseline (immediately preceding
capsule administration) and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 190 and 210 min post-capsule in Exp 1,
and at baseline and at 30, 60, 90, 150 and 240 min post-capsule in Exp 2. Subjective
measures were taken at the same time-points as the cardiovascular measures, with the
exception that the 210 minute time point was not collected in Exp 1. Exp 1 included the
Addiction Research Center Inventory [ARCI] [62,63], the Visual Analog Scales [VAS]
[64], and the Drug Effects Questionnaire [DEQ] [65], and the End of Session
Questionnaire (ESQ; given only at end). Exp 2 included only the ARCI and DEQ. See SI
Methods for more details.
Working Memory Task
In both Experiments, participants performed 90 trials (3 blocks of 30) of a
discrete whole report task [13,14]. On each trial, participants briefly viewed (200 ms) an
array of 6 brightly colored squares, and remembered the colors and locations of the
squares across a blank delay (1,000 ms). Colors for each trial were chosen without
replacement from a set of 9 highly-discriminable colors [14]. At test, “response grids”
appeared at each location (3x3 grid of all 9 colors). Participants freely recalled the colorlocation pairing of each item by clicking the color in each response grid that

corresponded to the color remembered at that location. They were required to make a
response to all 6 squares before moving on to the next trial.
Task-Unrelated Thoughts. In Exp 1, participants were occasionally probed
(20% of trials) about the contents of their thoughts at the moment of the probe.
Participants could choose between the categories of “on task”, “mind wandering”, or
“zoning out”. If mind wandering, they were asked to further classify whether their mind
had wandered toward the future, the past, “other”, or “I don’t know”. Participants were
given instructions and examples of each category during the orientation pre-session.
Item-level Confidence Judgements. In Exp 2, participants made a binary
confidence judgement for each response. If they felt they had “some information” in
mind about the item, they should click the color with the left mouse button. If they felt
they had “no information” in mind, they should click the color with the right mouse
button. The number of confident items was calculated for each trial by summing the
number of left click responses (out of 6).
Statistical Analysis
To assess subjective and physiological measures at the time of the working
memory test, we calculated a change score from baseline (timepoint immediately before
consuming the capsule). In Exp 1, we used the time-point closest in time to the WM test
(120 min for 4 participants who started the WM task at ~130 min; 190 min for remaining
participants who started the WM test at 160 min). In Exp 2, we used the time-point
immediately following the WM Test (240 min). In Exp 1, one participants’ heart rate and
blood pressure could not be collected due to device malfunction, leaving 22 participants,
and one participants’ subjective measures could not be collected due to a computer
malfunction, leaving 22 participants.
Significance of placebo versus THC (15 mg) in Exp 1 was tested by paired t-test
(2-tailed) of the 2 conditions. Significance of a THC effect in Exp 2 was tested by 1-way
Repeated Measures ANOVA, with the within-subjects factor Drug containing 3 levels
(Placebo, 7.5 mg THC, 15 mg THC).
Literature Review and Power Analysis
We reviewed the literature to find within-subjects, randomized, placebo-controlled
studies testing the acute effect of THC on working memory performance (SI Methods).
By far the most common test of working memory was the Digit Span
(Forward/Backward) Task. We found 15 papers meeting our inclusion criteria that
reported the results of a standard Digit Span task [17–31]. Together, these papers
reported a total of 57 different conditions that were tested (e.g. Forward vs. Backward
span, differing doses of THC). We did not include conditions from papers that reported
only combined Digit Span [66], or conditions measuring Digit Recall instead of Span
[67–71]. These and other tasks show consistent patterns, but we chose to focus on only
Digit Span conditions for our core arguments because this task (1) is the single mostused task and (2) is administered in a highly consistent manner. See SI Results for the
p-values across conditions for other working measures in the literature.
