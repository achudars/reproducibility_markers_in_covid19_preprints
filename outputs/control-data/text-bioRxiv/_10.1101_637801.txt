ABSTRACT

26

Targeted pathogen-selective approach to antibiotic development holds promise to minimize

27

collateral damage to the beneficial microbiome. The AB5-topology pertussis toxin (PtxS1-S5,

28

1:1:1:2:1) is a major virulence factor of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of the highly

29

contagious respiratory disease whooping cough. Once internalized into the host cell, PtxS1 ADP-

30

ribosylates α-subunits of the heterotrimeric Gαi-superfamily, thereby disrupting G-protein-

31

coupled receptor signaling. Here, we report the discovery of the first small molecules inhibiting

32

the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of pertussis toxin. We developed protocols to purify mg-

33

levels of truncated but highly active recombinant B. pertussis PtxS1 from Escherichia coli and an

34

in vitro high throughput-compatible assay to quantify NAD+ consumption during PtxS1-

35

catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαi. Two inhibitory compounds (NSC228155 and NSC29193)

36

with low micromolar IC50-values (3.0 µM and 6.8 µM) were identified in the in vitro NAD+

37

consumption assay that also were potent in an independent in vitro assay monitoring conjugation

38

of ADP-ribose to Gαi. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations identified plausible binding

39

poses of NSC228155 and in particular of NSC29193, most likely owing to the rigidity of the

40

latter ligand, at the NAD+-binding pocket of PtxS1. NSC228155 inhibited the pertussis AB5

41

holotoxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαi in living human cells with a low micromolar IC50-

42

value (2.4 µM). NSC228155 and NSC29193 might prove useful hit compounds in targeted B.

INTRODUCTION

49

Whooping cough, i.e. pertussis, is a globally distributed acute respiratory disease 1. Whooping

50

cough affects all age groups 1. However, young children are the most affected age group where

51

the disease may lead to death despite hospital intensive care and use of antibiotics 1. Worldwide

52

estimates of cases and deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2014 were 24.1 million and

53

160.700, respectively 2. Despite efficient global vaccine campaign whooping cough remains

54

endemic and recent data, e.g. from USA 3, indicate that the number of cases is increasing.

55

Moreover, macrolide resistant B. pertussis strains have been reported 4, 5. Sizeable outbreaks have

56

also been witnessed 1, but the reasons for the resurgence are incompletely understood. On the one

57

hand, improved diagnostics and surveillance methods as well as increased awareness of

58

whooping cough by health care professionals might contribute 1. On the other hand, molecular

59

changes in the pathogenic B. pertussis lineages and waning immunity especially after receipt of

60

acellular pertussis vaccines have been debated 1. These data highlight the need to improve the

61

vaccine formulations and vaccination campaigns, but also to develop alternative means to treat

62

whooping cough.

63

Pertussis toxin is a major virulence factor of B. pertussis 6, and a detoxified form of the toxin

64

is included in all acellular pertussis vaccine formulations. Clinical isolates lacking pertussis toxin

65

have turned out to be rare 7. When administrated systemically to experimental animals, e.g. to

66

mice 8, pertussis toxin recapitulated the leukocytosis (increase in number of circulating white

67

blood cells) seen in young children with whooping cough. Rats experimentally infected with B.

68

pertussis developed prolonged paroxysmal coughing, but an isogenic pertussis toxin-deficient

69

strain did not cause such pathology

70

toxin-deficient strain of B. pertussis survived a challenge, which caused 100% mortality with the

71

parental strain 11. Therefore, targeting of pertussis toxin might prove beneficial in the treatment of

72

whooping cough, especially in young children who still lack the vaccine-induced protection.

73

Pertussis toxin is composed of five non-covalently bound subunits (PtxS1-S5), which are

74

arranged in an AB5-topology 12, 13. The B5-assembly is formed by the PtxS2-S5 subunits (PtxS2,

75

PtxS3, 2 copies of PtxS4, PtxS5)

76

pathway and Ptl type IV secretion system 14. The B5-assembly mediates binding of the secreted

77

AB5 holotoxin on the surface of various different cell types in a carbohydrate-dependent manner

78

13

12, 13

. Pertussis toxin is secreted from the bacteria via Sec-

. Subsequent cell entry is followed by dissociation of the B5-assembly and the PtxS1-subunit 15,
16

79

which belongs to the family of ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs)

80

single C-terminal cysteine residue in α-subunits of most heterotrimeric Gαi-superfamily members

81

such as Gαi, Gαo, and Gαt 17-19. The C-terminus of the heterotrimeric G-protein α-subunits makes

82

functionally important contacts with the plasma membrane-localized G-protein coupled receptors

83

(GPCRs)

84

subunit, and also the βγ-dimer, from the GPCRs and inhibits the agonist stimulation-induced

85

signal propagation inside the cell.

86

In this study, we set out to identify small molecular weight compounds that inhibit the Gαi-

87

specific ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of pertussis toxin, and thereby to potentially interfere

88

with the pathological effects of pertussis toxin.

RESULTS

97

Purification of recombinant PtxS1 (rPtxS1) from E. coli – We did not succeed in purifying the

98

full length N- or C-terminally HIS-tagged recombinant B. pertussis PtxS1 from E. coli due to

99

weak solubility and proteolytic instability (data not shown). Therefore, we engineered a double

100

deletion to ptxA resulting into expression of an N-terminally HIS-tagged version of B. pertussis

101

Tohama I strain PtxS1 (UniProt_P04977), referred hereafter to as rPtxS1, which lacks the N-

102

terminal secretion signal sequence as well as part of the C-terminus (Fig. 1, Fig. 2A). Structural

103

data of the pertussis AB5 holotoxin demonstrate that the C-terminus of PtxS1 masks the active

104

site, and indicate that di-sulfide bond reduction (Cys41-Cys201) and significant movement of the

105

C-terminus would be required for catalysis12, 13. Our C-terminal truncation exposes the ADP-

106

ribosyltransferase catalytic site of PtxS1 including the NAD+-binding pocket (Fig. 1)12, 13.

107

rPtxS1, as purified with metal affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), is

108

proteolytically stable and migrates between the 25 and 20 kDa protein markers in SDS-PAGE

109

(Fig. 2B), in accordance with a theoretical size of 23.4 kDa. In order to study the oligomerization

110

state of rPtxS1 in solution, size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering

111

(SEC-MALS) was used. Purified rPtxS1 appeared as a single peak (Fig. 2C), with an estimate of

112

23.04 ± 0.2 kDa in a triplicate run indicating that rPtxS1 is monomeric in solution. rPtxS1 is well

113

folded as evidenced by a sigmoidal curve with a melting temperature (Tm) of 54.67 ± 0.22 °C in

114

a differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF)-assay (Fig. 2D).

116

Analysis of the ART activity of rPtxS1 – ART activity of rPtxS1 towards Gαi was first studied

117

with a HEK293T cell membrane preparation having an endogenous level of Gαi in an NAD+-

118

biotin Western blot-assay. rPtxS1 ADP-ribosylated one major protein from the complex

119

membrane proteome (Fig. 2E). This protein migrated between the 55 and 35 kDa protein markers

120

in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2E), in accordance with a theoretical size of endogenous Gαi, e.g. 40.4 kDa

121

for isoform 1 (UniProt_P63096). Next, ART activity of rPtxS1 towards Gαi was studied with

122

recombinant N-terminally HIS-tagged Gαi (isoform 1, UniProt_P63096) purified from E. coli,

123

hereafter referred to as rGαi, in an NAD+ Western blot-assay. rPtxS1 ADP-ribosylated rGαi (Fig.

124

2F), indicating that Gαi may efficiently serve as a substrate without the G-protein βγ-complex or

125

other cellular constituents. SEC-analysis of rPtxS1-rGαi complex solution topology showed the

126

presence of only single monomeric rPtxS1 and rGαi proteins (Fig. S1). rPtxS1-rGαi complex

127

formation during catalysis therefore appears to be weak, i.e. the rGαi modification is based on a

128

transient kiss-and-run interaction. Interestingly, rPtxS1 modified itself (Fig. 2E), and it already

129

had become auto-ADP-ribosylated in the E. coli expression host (Fig. 2F). This activity was

130

drastically diminished in a Q127D/E129D double mutant of rPtxS1(Fig. S2A), hereafter referred

131

to as rPtxS1-mutant. Based on a DSF-assay, the Tm of the rPtxS1-mutant was 52.00 ± 0 °C as

132

compared to Tm of the rPtxS1-wt (Tm of 54.67 ± 0.22 °C), indicating that the Q127D/E129D

133

double mutation does not affect the folding of rPtxS1. The rPtxS1-mutant was also incapable of

134

ADP-ribosylating rGαi (Fig. S2B). This double mutant of rPtxS1 was analyzed, because

135

structurally identical mutations in a recently discovered pertussis-like toxin from E. coli caused

136

catalytic inactivation, although NAD+ was still capable of binding to the protein (Fig. S2C)

137

Q127 and E129 of rPtxS1 are also conserved with several other bacterial ART-toxins where these

138

residues position NAD+, in particular the nicotinamide end (Fig. S2C), and promote the transfer

21

.

139

of ADP-ribose to a substrate amino acid residue 16. To assess the substrate amino acid specificity

140

of the extensively truncated rPtxS1 (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2A), we analyzed the C351A mutant of

141

rGαi (UniProt_P63096), hereafter referred to as rGαi-mutant, in an NAD+-biotin Western blot-

142

assay. rPtxS1 ADP-ribosylated rGαi, but it was incapable of ADP-ribosylating the rGαi-mutant

143

(Fig. S3). Based on a DSF-assay, the Tm of the rGαi-mutant was 44.33 ± 0.23 °C as compared to

144

Tm of the rGαi-wt (Tm of 43.83 ± 0.23 °C), indicating that the C351A mutation does not affect

145

the folding of rGαi. Therefore, rPtxS1 is not only catalytically active towards rGαi, but it also

146

retains the Gαi substrate amino acid specificity evidenced with the pertussis AB5 holotoxin 17-19.

147

148

Multiwell-based assay set-up for screening of rPtxS1 inhibitors – We analyzed the suitability

149

of a fluorometric method to screen for rPtxS1 inhibitors previously developed for poly-ADP-

150

ribose (PAR) synthesizing enzymes

151

synthesizing enzymes

152

fluorophore with emission maximum at 444 nm 22. The decrease in fluorescence in comparison to

153

the non-enzyme control is a measure of NAD+-consuming enzymatic activity

154

rPtxS1 with rGαi for 40 min resulted in a strong decrease of fluorescence (Fig. 3A). No

155

fluorescence decrease was detected with the rPtxS1-mutant under identical conditions (Fig. 3A).

156

Assays with different concentrations of rPtxS1 were stopped at various time points to measure

157

NAD+ consumption in the presence of a constant amount of rGαi substrate. These data

158

demonstrated that an increase in the rPtxS1 concentration increases NAD+ consumption that also

159

progresses over time (Fig. 3B). rPtxS1 could also consume NAD+ in the absence of rGαi,

160

although much slower than with the rGαi substrate (Fig. 3A). This NAD+ glycohydrolase activity,

161

i.e. enzyme-catalyzed reaction between NAD+ and water to yield ADP-ribose and nicotinamide,

162

was not detected with the rPtxS1-mutant (Fig. 3A). The effect of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on

163

the NAD+-consuming activity of rPtxS1 was also studied because small molecules in chemical

164

libraries are usually dissolved in DMSO typically resulting in assay concentrations of 0.1% – 1%

165

DMSO. DMSO did not have a significant effect on the NAD+-consuming activity of rPtxS1 in

166

the presence of rGαi substrate up to 0.2% DMSO, while 1% DMSO already significantly (p = 10-

167

4

) reduced activity (Fig. 3C). We chose to perform compound screening for rPtxS1 inhibitors in

168

the presence of 0.1% DMSO. To test reproducibility of the fluorometric assay, maximum (NAD+

169

as incubated in plain buffer) and minimum (NAD+ as incubated in rPtxS1- and rGαi-containing

170

buffer) signals were measured from five independent runs to test plate-to-plate and day-to-day

171

variability. The average Z’ value for the assay was 0.68, indicating that the fluorometric assay is

172

suitable for high throughput screening. The statistical parameters of the NAD+ quantitation assay

173

are summarized in Table S1.

174

175

Screening for rPtxS1 inhibitors – We first analyzed a panel of selected compounds (n = 32)

176

known to inhibit the ART-activity of human diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferases

177

(ARTDs/PARPs). These compounds (Table S2), which also included several FDA-approved anti-

178

cancer drugs such as Rucaparib, did not inhibit the NAD+-consumption activity of rPtxS1 in the

179

presence of rGαi when analyzed at 80-fold molar excess to rPtxS1 (arbitrary inhibitory threshold

180

= 50%). Next, we screened a diversity set compound library obtained from the National Cancer

181

Institute (NCI) Developmental Therapeutics program repository (https://dtp.cancer.gov), which at

182

the time of acquiring contained 1,695 compounds (diversity set III). The so-called diversity set

183

contains selected compounds, e.g. to represent high scaffold diversity, from the over 100,000

184

NCI-repository compounds. A total of nine compound hits were identified, which inhibited the

185

NAD+-consumption activity of rPtxS1 in the presence of rGαi more than 50% when analyzed at
8

186

80-fold molar excess to rPtxS1. These nine compounds were analyzed in an independent NAD+-

187

biotin Western blot-assay, which measures the rPtxS1-catalyzed conjugation of ADP-ribose-

188

biotin onto rGαi. Five out of the nine primary compound hits showed strong inhibition of rPtxS1-

189

catalyzed rGαi ADP-ribosylation when analyzed at 200-fold molar excess to rPtxS1 (Fig. 4A,

190

titration effect shown for NSC228155 and NSC29193 in Fig. 4B). NSC119875 (Cisplatin, DNA

191

alkylating agent used in cancer treatments) and NSC44750 affected rGαi and/or rPtxS1 protein

192

integrity in the NAD+-biotin Western-blot based assay (Fig. 4A), even if the assay was performed

193

with a 10-fold lower compound concentration (data not shown). NSC119875 and NSC44750

194

were therefore excluded from further studies. To evaluate the potency of the remaining three

195

compounds to inhibit rPtxS1, dose response studies were performed using the fluorometric

196

NAD+-consumption assay in the presence of rGαi. NSC228155 and NSC29193 had IC50-values

197

of 3.0 and 6.8 μM, respectively (Fig. 4C). NSC149286 was less potent than the other two

198

compounds with an IC50-value of 20 μM (Fig. 4C), and was excluded from further analyses.

199

Chemical structures of the hit compounds are shown in Figure 4C. NSC228155 and NSC29193

200

appeared to have mimicry to the adenine base or the nicotinamide end of NAD+ (Fig. 4D). We

201

also utilized an alternative readout of the NAD+-biotin assay, i.e. capture of HIS-tagged proteins

202

on 96-well nickel-coated plates followed by the detection of protein-conjugated ADP-ribose-

203

biotin. As shown in Figure 4E, NSC228155 and NSC29193 showed strong inhibition of the

204

rPtxS1-catalyzed conjugation of ADP-ribose-biotin onto rGαi. NSC228155 and NSC29193 also

205

inhibited the auto-ADP-ribosylation activity of rPtxS1 (Fig. 4F), indicating that these two

206

compounds interact directly with rPtxS1. The two hit compounds were not identified as pan-

207

assay interference compounds or aggregators (zinc15.docking.org). In summary, compound

208

screening resulted into identification of NSC228155 and NSC29193, which inhibited the ART

209

activity of rPtxS1 in low micromolar concentrations.

211

Putative binding poses of NSC29193 and NSC228155 to PtxS1 – In order to evaluate possible

212

binding modes of the compounds to PtxS1, we performed docking and molecular dynamic

213

simulation (MDS). The top ranked poses of NSC228155 shared features, including the placement

214

of the aromatic pyridine ring of NSC228155 in an enclosed region where the nicotinamide ring of

215

NAD+ would bind to PtxS1, with the double benzoxadiazole ring positioned near the center of the

216

NAD+-binding pocket. The benzoxadiazole ring is joined to the pyridine ring via a central sulfur

217

atom, and the rotatable bonds permit the adoption of varying conformations. In pose 1 (Fig. 5A),

218

with the lowest free energy of binding (ΔGbind of -51.2 kcal/mol; docking score of -4.08

219

kcal/mol), the pyridine ring oxygen of the ligand forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain

220

nitrogen atom of Tyr10, anchoring the ligand to an aromatic area of the binding pocket, and with

221

π-π stacking interactions observed for the pyridine ring with nearby Tyr59 and for the

222

benzoxadiazole ring with Tyr63. In pose 2 (Fig. 5B), having the best docking score (-4.20

223

kcal/mol; ΔGbind of -43.3 kcal/mol), the pyridine ring is rotated 90° relative to pose 1, losing the

224

backbone hydrogen bond with Tyr10, but making π-π interactions with both Tyr63 and Tyr10,

225

and ionic interactions with Arg9 and Arg67. In MDS, pose 1 showed stability and retained its

226

position with respect to the original docked position, only differing on average by an root-mean-

227

square deviation (RMSD) of 0.9 Å (Fig. S4A), and the RMSD for the ligand orientations differ

228

on average by 2.3 Å when the coordinates of PtxS1 are superposed over the backbone atoms. In

229

contrast, pose 2 was unstable at the initial binding position and occupied different locations of the

230

binding pocket with an average 22 Å RMSD for the ligand based on superposing the PtxS1

231

coordinates from the simulation (Fig. S4B).

232

In contrast to NSC228155, NSC29193 is rigid and almost exclusively resulted in two docked

233

poses. Pose 1 of NSC29193 is positioned near the binding site for the nicotinamide ring of NAD+

234

in the PtxS1, hydrogen bonding with main-chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms of Tyr10 (Fig. 5C).

235

Additionally, NSC29193 forms π-cation interactions with Arg9, π-π stacking with Tyr63 and

236

hydrogen bonding with the side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser52. NSC29193, pose 2, is bound near

237

the location where the adenine ring of NAD+ would be bound in the pertussis toxin, stacking

238

against the aromatic ring of Trp26 and hydrogen bonding with the main-chain oxygen atom of

239

Thr24 (Fig. 5D) as well as forming ionic interactions with Arg9 and Arg13. During MDS,

240

NSC29193 pose 1 was quite stable, with an average RMSD of 0.1 and 1.0 Å with respect to the

241

ligand and receptor backbone atoms (Fig. S4C), and interactions between the ligand and main-

242

chain atoms of Tyr10 were conserved for over 90% of the simulation time. The π-π interactions

243

with Tyr63 and π-cation interactions with Arg9 were also retained for the majority of the

244

simulation time. In contrast, the binding mode of pose 2 was disrupted at around 20 ns of the

245

simulation (Fig. S4D), mainly due to the reorientation of the indole ring of Trp26, which appears

246

to be one of the key interaction partners of NSC29193. Consequently, in pose 2 the ligand moves

247

from the initial binding position and binds to several areas of the binding pocket. This is reflected

248

by the average 12 Å RMSD of the ligand with respect to the superposed coordinates of the toxin

249

from the simulation (Fig. S4D). Taken together, docking and MDS resulted in identification of

250

plausible binding poses of NSC228155 and in particular for NSC29193, most likely owing to the

251

rigidity of the latter ligand, at the NAD+-binding pocket of PtxS1.

252

253

NSC228155 and NSC29193 as inhibitors of pertussis toxin in living human cells – First, to

254

find the optimal toxin dosage, we titrated the pertussis AB5 holotoxin and detected the ADP-

55 kDa protein markers in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A), in accordance with a theoretical size of

259

endogenous Gαi, e.g. 40.4 kDa for isoform 1 (UniProt_P63096). Next, we pre-incubated the

260

HEK293T cells for 30 min with the compounds NSC228155 or NSC29193 prior to addition of

261

the holotoxin and subsequent co-incubation. We did not detect inhibitory action for the

262

compound NSC29193 despite multiple analyzed conditions (data not shown), e.g. i) 30 min pre-

263

incubation with inhibitor (0.1, 1, 10 and 50 µM) + 2 h with holotoxin (10 ng/mL) or ii) 1, 2, 3, 4

264

and 5 h pre-incubation with 50 µM inhibitor + 2 h with holotoxin (10 ng/mL). However,

265

compound NSC228155 inhibited the Gαi-specific ADP-ribosylation activity of holotoxin in a

266

concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Some inhibitory action was evidenced with 0.1 and 1

267

µM of NSC228155, but 5 µM of NSC228155 resulted in a near complete inhibition of mono-

268

ADP-ribosylation of Gαi. Based on pixel intensity analysis of the anti-MAR signal, the IC50 of

269

NSC228155 inhibitory effect was 2.35 µM (Fig. 6C).

270

Having established NSC228155 as a potent inhibitor of pertussis toxin in living HEK293T

271

cells, we turned our attention to the maximum tolerated dose. NSC228155, at the effective 5 µM

272

inhibitory concentration, did not significantly increase the DNA-damage induced PARP1 (also

273

called ARTD1) poly-ADP-ribosylation or cell death-associated PARP1/ARTD1 proteolytic

274

processing from the approximately 120 kDa full length form into the approximately 90 kDa form

275

(Fig. 6D). However, visual alterations, including partial cell detachment, was detected in

276

HEK293T cell monolayers upon titration of NSC228155 up to 50 µM in the 2.5 h Gαi ADP-

277

ribosylation assay (data not shown). Therefore, we utilized the MTT-assay, i.e. reduction of

278

tetrazolium salt into formazan by metabolically active cells, to study the potential cytotoxicity of

279

NSC228155. The metabolic activity of HEK293T cells, as analyzed by the MTT-assay 3.5 h after

280

addition of NSC228155, was significantly affected with 20 µM or higher concentrations (Fig.

281

6E). IC50 of NSC228155 cytotoxicity was 15.33 µM (Fig. 6E). In conclusion, NSC228155 is a

DISCUSSION

290

We report the identification of the first small molecular weight compounds inhibiting the ADP-

291

ribosyltransferase activity of pertussis toxin in vitro and in living cells. ADP-ribosyltransferase

292

activity of pertussis toxin is important for the pathological effects of pertussis toxin. Seven-day-

293

old neonatal mice infected with a B. pertussis strain expressing a mutant of PtxS1 lacking the

294

ART-activity fully survived a challenge, which caused 100% mortality with the parental strain of

295

B. pertussis

296

inducing leukocytosis in mice in doses that were 100-fold more than the median lethal dose of

297

wild-type AB5 holotoxin

298

pertussis toxin might prove beneficial in the treatment of whooping cough.

11

. Purified AB5 holotoxin containing the same PtxS1 mutant was incapable of

24

. Therefore, targeting of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of

299

Compound library screening was made possible due to our ability to purify mg-levels of a

300

truncated but highly active recombinant B. pertussis PtxS1 (rPtxS1) from E. coli. rPtxS1 retained

301

the high amino acid specificity of pertussis AB5 holotoxin toward the single C-terminal cysteine

302

in Gαi

303

terminal signal sequence ending at Ala34

304

of PtxS1 from the cytoplasm into the periplasm where the AB5 holotoxin is assembled prior to Ptl

305

type IV secretion system-mediated export. The truncated part of the PtxS1 C-terminus masks the

17-19

. Used truncation positions in rPtxS1 are functionally justified. PtxS1 contains an N25, 26

that gets cleaved upon the Sec-mediated secretion

12, 13

. Our truncation approach bypasses the need for disulfide bond

and extensive conformational movement of the C-terminus

12, 13

to activate PtxS1,

310

We made an initial attempt to identify PtxS1 inhibitory compounds from molecules (n = 32,

311

see Table S2) known to inhibit the ART-activity of human diphtheria toxin-like ADP-

312

ribosyltransferases (ARTDs/PARPs). We envisioned that some of these compounds, which target

313

the ARTD/PARP NAD+-binding pockets, could provide a fast track to antibiotic development via

314

repurposing drug strategy, due to the current FDA-approvals in cancer therapy. However, none of

315

these compounds significantly inhibited the NAD+-consumption activity of rPtxS1 in the

316

presence of rGαi. Therefore, we decided to screen a diversity set compound library (n = 1,695)

317

obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Developmental Therapeutics program

318

repository (https://dtp.cancer.gov). Two potent inhibitory compounds NSC29193 and

319

NSC228155 with low micromolar IC50-values were identified in the in vitro NAD+ consumption

320

assay. These compounds were also potent in an independent in vitro assay where we monitored

321

the amount of rGαi-conjugated ADP-ribose-biotin upon rPtxS1 catalysis by streptavidin-HRP

322

Western blotting (see Fig. 4B). NSC228155 and NSC29193 also inhibited the auto-ADP-

323

ribosylation activity of rPtxS1 (see Fig. 4F), indicating that these two compounds interact directly

324

with rPtxS1. Our docking and molecular dynamic simulations resulted in plausible binding poses

325

for both ligands NSC228155 and NSC29193 (see Fig. 5 and S4). More consistent, energetically

326

favorable binding poses were observed for NSC29193. This appears to be in accordance with the

327

compound structures (see Fig. 4C). NSC29193 (purine-2,8-dithiol) is a rather rigid purine

328

analogue that mimics the structure of the adenine base of NAD+ (see Fig. 4D). NSC228155, on

329

the other hand, contains two major molecular structures, connected by a rotatable linker, one ring

330

compound mimicking the adenine base of NAD+ and the other ring compound mimicking the

331

nicotinamide of NAD+. It is noteworthy that 7 other compounds were also positive in the in vitro

332

NAD+ consumption assay, some apparently via deleterious effects for protein stability as

333

evidenced by the independent in vitro ADP-ribose conjugation assay (see Fig. 4A), i.e.

334

compounds NSC44750 and NSC119875 (cisplatin). The data highlights the importance of

335

validating the primary screening hits in alternative and independent in vitro assays. In summary,

336

compound screening resulted into the identification of two compounds, NSC29193 and

337

NSC228155, which inhibited the rPtxS1-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of rGαi in vitro with low

338

micromolar IC50-values.

339

NSC228155, but not NSC29193, was a potent inhibitor of pertussis holotoxin-mediated ADP-

340

ribosylation of Gαi in living HEK293T cells. We analyzed multiple different experimental set-

341

ups with NSC29193, including concentrations up to 50 µM that did not cause visible alterations

342

or cell detachment of HEK293T cell monolayers. In respect of previous drug screening

343

approaches there appears to be no published information on NSC29193. Accordingly, the cell

344

permeability of NSC29193 is not known, but might be weak and thus explain our negative

345

inhibitory data. In sharp contrast, we detected a near complete inhibition of the Gαi ADP-

346

ribosylation with 5 µM NSC228155 (see Fig. 6). In part, this could relate to the fact that

347

NSC228155 easily permeates cells. It has been shown in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells that 5

348

min incubation with 100 µM NSC228155 caused rapid movement of this inherently fluorescent

349

molecule across cell membranes and dispersal to both the cytoplasm and nucleus 29. However, we

350

witnessed significant toxicity of NSC228155 for HEK293T cells with 20 µM or higher

351

concentrations after a 3.5-h incubation (cytotoxicity IC50 – 15.33 µM see Fig. 6E). This

352

cytotoxicity might be caused by the proposed NSC228155-mediated production of reactive

353

oxygen species (ROS) inside the cell 29. In this respect, it is noteworthy that, upon incubation of
15

354

cells with 5 µM of NSC228155 for 2.5 h, we did not detect auto-ADP-ribosylation of

355

PARP1/ARTD1 (see Fig. 6D), which is induced in cells upon ROS-induced DNA damage

356

Moreover, we did not detect caspase-mediated proteolytic PARP1/ARTD1 cleavage (see Fig.

357

6D), which is a robust readout for the onset of programmed cell death. However, future hit

358

development needs to address the apparent cell toxicity effects of NCS228155 at high

359

concentrations. Taken together, NSC228155 is a potent cell permeable hit compound to inhibit

360

pertussis holotoxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of Gαi in living cells in low micromolar

361

concentrations.

362

CONCLUSION

363

Resurgence of whooping cough has been witnessed even in highly vaccinated populations 1-3, and

364

currently there are no specific therapeutics to treat whooping cough. Macrolide antibiotics, when

365

administrated at a very early stage, show therapeutic effects in certain patient subgroups such as

366

in infants <3 months of age

367

reported

368

toxin might prove beneficial in the treatment of whooping cough, especially in young children

369

who still lack the vaccine-induced protection against whooping cough. In this respect, several

370

drug modes of action could be envisioned, including to inhibit – i) secretion from the bacterium,

371

ii) host cell recognition, iii) endocytosis, iv) intracellular trafficking, and v) ADP-ribosylation

372

activity inside the host cell. Humanized monoclonal antibodies have been developed that block

373

pertussis toxin cell surface receptor interaction or the subsequent internalization and retrograde

374

trafficking 32. These humanized antibodies prevented the characteristic signs of whooping cough

375

in mouse and baboon models 33. Our current study shows that small molecular weight compounds

376

inhibiting the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of pertussis toxin might also have therapeutic

377

potential. Similar findings have been published on some other ADP-ribosylating bacterial toxins,

were collected after 24 h by centrifugation and were either frozen to -80°C as pellets, in lysis

Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) – rPtxS1 at a concentration of 0.25 mg/mL was used

449

in PBS. Protein was incubated with 5 × SYPRO orange (Thermo Scientific) for 10 minutes. The

450

samples were heated from 20-90°C with 1°C increments (1 min/1°C). The experiment was run on

451

2500 Real-Time PCR systems (Applied Biosystems). The resulting data was analyzed with

452

Boltzmann sigmoidal equation using GraphPad (GraphPad software, Inc.). Thermal stability of

453

rGαi, rGαi-mutant and rPtxS1 alone as well as in the presence of NSC228155 or NSC29193, was

454

analyzed by DSF using a CFX96 Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). rGαi, rGαi-mutant

and rPtxS1 at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL was used in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl,

456

10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP. The inhibitor concentrations used in the assay ranged from

457

50 µM to 1 mM. Samples were incubated with 5 × SYPRO Orange (Thermo Scientific) for 5

The cells were incubated at 4°C for 1 h in rotation to allow them to swell and partially lyse. The

472

partial lysates were drawn 20 times through 27-gauge needles and centrifuged with low speed

473

(600 × g, 4°C, 10 min) to pellet the nuclei and insoluble cell debris. The low-speed supernatant

was subjected to high-speed centrifugation (16100 × g, 4°C, 30 min) to pellet the membranes.

The membranes were resolubilized into 50 μL of 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM

502

Reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli loading dye to 1 × and heating for 3 minutes at

503

90°C. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes,

504

followed by blocking with 1% (w/v) casein blocking buffer (Bio-Rad, 161-0782). Membranes

In vitro NAD+ consumption assay – i) basic reaction set-up Reactions were carried out in a U-

529

shaped 96-well black plate (Greiner BioOne, 650209). Typically, reactions were conducted with

530

50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 25°C with shaking at 300 rpm with a reaction volume of 50

531

μL. The reactions were stopped by adding 20 μL of 20% acetophenone (diluted with ethanol) and

532

20 μL of 2M KOH and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. 90 μL of formic acid was

533

added and further incubated for 20 minutes. The plates were read using Tecan infinity M1000 pro

534

with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 372 and 444 nm, respectively. Maximum signal

535

was defined as the NAD+ buffer control and the minimum signal was the rPtxS1-catalyzed

536

reaction in the presence of rGαi. The raw fluorescence values were always subtracted from blank

537

containing buffer. The assay was optimized to reach 60% NAD+ consumption. The optimized

538

conditions for the assay are 125 nM rPtxS1, 500 nM NAD+ and 1 µM rGαi. The reaction has

539

incubation time of 40 minutes at 25°C with shaking at 300 rpm. The DMSO concentration used

540

was 0.1%. DMSO tolerance test was done with optimized conditions (0.1-5%). For rGαi

substrate-independent NAD+ consumption activity of rPtxS1, identical conditions were used

542

except that rGαi was excluded with longer incubation time of 60 minutes. Statistical analyses on

543

typically 8 parallel values was conducted using two-tailed Student’s t-test two sample equal

544

variance. ii) validation of the NAD+ consumption assay In order to establish repeatability of

545

values for maximum and minimum signals between plates, wells and days, five control plates

546

were tested. Experimental conditions and protein batches used for assay validation were the

547

same. Three plates were made on one day while second and third days had one plate each. Each

548

plate had 40 wells for maximum and minimum signals individually with buffer blanks. The CV%

background, screening window coefficient (Z’) were calculated as described previously 22, 23. iii)

552

small molecule library screening Each plate had buffer blank, control reaction (minimum signal,

553

with rPtxS1-wt) and maximum signal (NAD+ and rGαi). Both maximum and minimum signals

554

contain 0.1% DMSO. To correct for inherent fluorescence of compounds separate controls with

555

NAD+, Gαi and compounds were prepared. Compounds were tested at a concentration of 10 μM.

556

Compounds displaying inhibition more than 50% were considered as hits. Compound library for

557

screening was obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Developmental Therapeutics

558

program repository (https://dtp.cancer.gov). After the screening, we re-ordered the primary hit

559

compounds in a powder form for subsequent in vitro and in vivo analyses. The hit compounds

560

were analyzed to identify pan-assay interference compounds or aggregators (zinc15.docking.org).

561

iv) IC50 measurements Assay incubation time was adjusted such that the substrate conversion did

562

not exceed 30% in order to minimize the effect of reduction in substrate concentration while

563

maintaining a robust signal. Compounds were tested from a concentration range of (100-0.01

564

μM) in half-log dilution series. Each plate had buffer blank, positive control where PtxS1-wt is
