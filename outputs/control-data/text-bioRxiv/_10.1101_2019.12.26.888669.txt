Abstract
Thiol peroxidase from ​Escherichia coli (​Ec​TPx) is a peroxiredoxin that catalyzes the reduction
of different hydroperoxides. During the catalytic cycle of ​Ec​TPx, the peroxidatic cysteine (C​P​) is
oxidized to a sulfenic acid by peroxide, then the resolving cysteine (C​R​) condenses with the
sulfenic acid of C​P to form a disulfide bond, which is finally reduced by thioredoxin. Purified
Ec​TPx as dithiol and disulfide behaves as a monomer in close to physiological conditions.
Although secondary structure rearrangements are present when comparing different redox states
of the enzyme, no significant differences in unfolding free energies are observed under reducing
and oxidizing conditions. A conformational change denominated ​fully folded (FF) to locally
unfolded (LU) transition,​ involving a partial unfolding of αH2 and αH3 helices, must occur to
enable the formation of the disulfide bond since the catalytic cysteines are 12 Å apart in the FF
conformation of ​Ec​TPx. To explore this crucial process, the mechanism of the FF➝LU and the
LU➝FF transitions were studied using long time scale conventional molecular dynamic
simulations and an enhanced conformational sampling technique for different oxidation and
protonation states of C​P and/or C​R​. Our results suggest that the FF➝LU transition has a higher
associated energy barrier than the refolding LU➝FF process in agreement with the relatively
slow experimental turnover number of ​Ec​TPx. Furthermore, ​in silico designed single-point
mutants of the αH3 enhanced locally unfolding events, suggesting that the native FF interactions
in the active site are not evolutionary optimized to fully speed-up the conformational transition
of wild-type ​Ec​TPx.

Introduction
Escherichia coli thiol peroxidase (​Ec​TPx, UniProt entry P0A862) is a small and globular
protein of 167 residues belonging to the peroxiredoxin (Prx) family ​[1–4]​. ​Ec​TPx shares the
prototypical thioredoxin fold, characterized by a seven strand β sheet core surrounded by five
helices with an N-terminal β hairpin extension (Figure 1A). Members of the TPx subfamily,
originally named p20 or scavengases ​[5,6]​, were identified as bacterial atypical 2-Cys Prxs, as
both catalytic cysteines (Cys) are located in the same polypeptide molecule, and conform one of
the less phylogenetically diverse subfamilies known ​[7]​.
Ec​TPx reduces H​2​O​2 ​[8] and alkyl hydroperoxides ​[9] via a reactive and absolutely
conserved peroxidatic Cys (C​P​) surrounded by the highly conserved PxxxT/SxxC​P motif ​[10] and
an Arg residue that constitute the active site ​[11]​. The first step of the catalytic mechanism
involves the nucleophilic attack of the C​P sulfur atom on the peroxide yielding the sulfenic acid
intermediate (Cys-SOH) and a water molecule if the substrate is H​2​O​2​. The progress in the
catalytic cycle depends on the presence and location of a second Cys residue (resolving Cys or
C​R​), that react with the sulfenic acid yielding a disulfide bond (R-C​P​-S-S-C​R​-R), releasing a
water molecule as a leaving group. Finally, the disulfide bond is reduced by thioredoxin (TRX),
through a typical thiol-disulfide exchange reaction (Figure 1B, ​[12]​).

disulfide bond between C​P and C​R​, and; III) the reduction of the disulfide by a thiol
oxidoreductase (TRX).
The catalytic cycle goes through at least one major conformational transition, the
so-called fully folded (FF) to ​locally unfolded (LU) transition ​[2,13–15]​, as C​P (Cys60) and C​R
(Cys94) are more than 12 Å apart in the crystallographic structure of the reduced (dithiol) state
(Figure 1A, ​[13]​). Whether the conformational equilibrium is modulated by the redox and
protonation state of C​P and/or C​R is still an open question. The transition involves a partial
unfolding of the C-terminal region of αH3 (residues 86 to 97), together with a smaller local
unfolding of the N-terminal region of αH2 and the preceding loop connected to the β5 strand and
changes in the solvent accessibility of C​P​ (Figure 1A).
The specificity constant of ​EcT
​ Px for H​2​O​2 ​(​k​cat​/K​M = 8.9 × 10​4 M​-1 s​-1​, ​[16]​) is in the
range observed for other TPx-Prx subfamily members ​[17]​. The kinetic parameters for the
individual steps in the reduction of H​2​O​2 by TPx (catalyzed by TRX) have been reported ​[8]​, ​k​cat
= 76 s​-1 (H​2​O​2​), K​M = 1.7 mM (H​2​O​2​) and K​M = 25.5 µM (TRX), and indicate that the most likely
rate-limiting step of the cycle is the peroxidation (Reaction I, Figure 1) since large
concentrations of H​2​O​2 would be needed to saturate the enzyme. The only other hydroperoxide
tested, cumene hydroperoxide, has a much smaller K​M (9.1 µM) pointing to a specialization of
the enzyme for larger hydrophobic peroxides. In those cases, reduction and/or resolution
reactions may become rate-limiting and both reactions involve the conformational transitions
under study, FF➝LU and LU➝FF, respectively. Crystallographic and kinetic approaches have
provided evidence describing the FF and LU conformations in different Prx subfamilies
[8,13,18,19]​. However, a thorough dynamic characterization of the FF➝LU and LU➝FF

conformational transitions with C​P modeled in the thiol, thiolate, sulfenic acid and sulfenate
states and C​R modeled in the thiol and thiolate states were studied in the present work, using long
time scale conventional molecular dynamic (cMD) simulations to study the intrinsic dynamics of
the FF and LU conformational substates together with the enhanced sampling technique
accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) to describe conformational changes. Additionally, a set
of biophysical experiments were carried out in order to characterize the oligomeric state, the
secondary/tertiary structure content and the thermodynamic properties of the dithiol and disulfide
states of the enzyme.

and coincides within 1 Da with the expected mass deduced from protein sequence, considering
the loss of two protons in the oxidized state and the lack of the initial Met residue. The secondary
and tertiary structure content of ​Ec​TPx in the dithiol (preincubated with 1 mM DTT) and
disulfide states were evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The spectrum in the
far-UV region show native-like signatures compatible with a folded protein (Figure 2A). The
lower negative signal at 222 nm and lower positive signal at 195 nm of the far-UV CD spectrum
in the oxidized form account for the loss of periodic helical structure compatible with the locally

unfolded (LU) conformation. Furthermore, the near-UV CD spectrum shows a significant gain of
negative band in the 270-285 nm region, in oxidizing conditions, which is also compatible with
the formation of a disulfide bond (Figure 2B), reflecting a change in the asymmetric environment
of aromatic residues near the active site (Figure 1B).

​ Px is shown in panel F. Far-UV CD
spectra of reduced ​Ec​TPX at different urea concentrations are shown in the inset.
A previous bioinformatic and structural analysis reported that the TPx subfamily shows a
region of highly conserved hydrophobic residues that in the oxidized state forms an
intermolecular interface involving a surface area of ~1400 Å​2 ​[8]​, suggesting a role for the
stabilization of the dimeric form of ​Ec​TPx in solution. In the same fashion, experimental
measurements carried out by analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the dimer is the
predominant species in solution above 40 ​μ​M. Furthermore, the authors concluded that the dimer
interface is involved in the stabilization of the active site ​[8]​. To evaluate the oligomeric state of
Ec​TPx at low micromolar concentrations (10-20 ​μM
​ ), we performed SEC-FPLC experiments
monitored by means of a multiangle light scattering detector at neutral pH and moderate ionic
strength (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The predominant species in both reduced
and oxidized conditions exhibited molecular masses compatible with a monomer species (Figure
2D). These observations are also in agreement with SEC experiments carried out with a TPx
from ​Helicobacter pylori ​[20] and the PrxQ from ​Xanthomonas campestris ​[21] that shows a
predominant monomeric species in both reduced and oxidized conditions. To test the effect of
ionic strength in the monomer-dimer equilibrium, SEC-FPLC experiments were carried out
increasing the NaCl concentration up to 400 mM. No dimeric species were observed, neither in
reduced nor oxidized conditions (data not shown).
Curiously, the oxidized enzyme at pH 6.1 forms a homotrimer with an average molecular
mass of 49.9 ± 1.1 kDa (Figure 2E). On the other hand, only a much less abundant and
highly-dispersed population, compatible with dimeric or trimeric forms, was detected for the

reduced state. Even more, a species with a molecular mass compatible with the monomer was
observed with a slightly higher elution volume, compared to that observed at pH 7.4 (Figure 2D
and E), possibly due to a particular interaction of the protein with the Superose-12 matrix at this
pH.
The urea-induced chemical unfolding of the reduced and oxidized states of ​EcT
​ Px are
cooperative, indicating that both states are organized and contain a native protein core. The
difference in free energy between the unfolded and folded state obtained by equilibrium
unfolding experiments are nearly unchanged in the oxidized or reduced states of ​Ec​TPx (Figure
2F, ΔG°​NU​< 0.5 kcal mol​-1​) which is in agreement with the low difference in the melting
temperature (​T​m​) observed for the TPx from ​H. pylori ​[20] in the reduced (​Tm​ =
66.6 °C) and
​
oxidized conditions (​Tm​ ​= 65.0 °C). However, it is worthy to note that the unfolded state of the
dithiol and disulfide states of ​Ec​TPx is structurally different because of the presence of the
disulfide bond, making difficult the comparison between them in energetics terms.
Structural Characterization of the Native FF and LU Conformational Substates by MD
Simulations
To get insights about the conformational transitions and internal motions that take place
during the catalytic cycle of ​Ec​TPx, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
Several systems were evaluated: (I) the wild-type ​Ec​TPx substituting Ser60 residue for Cys (C​P​)
as thiol, thiolate, sulfenic acid or sulfenate (starting from FF conformation, PDB ID 3HVV); (II)
the wild-type ​EcT
​ Px with C​P as thiol, thiolate, sulfenic acid or sulfenate starting from a
locally-unfolded-like conformation (LU*, PDB ID 3HVS chain A); (III) the wild-type ​EcT

four possible protonation combinations for both Cys (C​P and C​R​); (V) three single-point mutants
of the aH3 helix, starting from FF conformation, with C​P and C​R modeled in the sulfenic acid and
thiol form, respectively, substituting the residues Arg92, Phe93 or Glu97 of αH3 helix by Gly
(see text below).
In order to validate our computational simulation setup, a comparative analysis was
performed between the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the experimental structures of
Bacillus subtilis TPx (​BsT
​ Px) determined by NMR ​[19] in the truly reduced state (dithiol) with
the B factor of the crystallographic structures of ​Ec​TPx ​[8] and the root-mean-square fluctuation
(RMSF) of our conventional MD (cMD) simulations in the dithiol and disulfide states (Figure 3).
Remarkably, our cMD simulations of ​Ec​TPx captures the fundamental conformational features
of the reduced and oxidized ensembles. The RMSF profiles found in our simulations reproduce
very well the ensemble heterogeneities inferred from B factors and RMSD profiles
corresponding to ​EcT
​ px and ​BsT
​ Px, respectively.

These analyses pointed out the possibility to explore the dynamics of the FF and LU

and sulfenate species. In this regard, there is a clear difference in the interactions that each

species can form and how they may influence in the FF ⇆ LU transition. The thiolate species is a
hydrogen bond (HB) acceptor and can establish salt bridge interactions due to its negative net
charge, so it is expected to stabilize the FF conformation through interactions with polar and
charged residues in the vicinity, particularly the conserved Thr57 and Arg132 of the active site.
On the other hand, the thiol group is a poor HB donor due to the low electronegativity and large
size of the sulfur atom, moreover, it cannot establish ionic interactions. Once the C​P is oxidized,
the presence of the C​P​-SOH group, that can form stronger HB due to the extra oxygen atom,
could affect the HB network of the active site. Additionally, being more voluminous than thiol or
thiolate, the sulfenic acid species may affect the conformational architecture of the active site
[22]​. Furthermore, if the sulfenate is the predominant species at neutral pH ​[23]​, the oxygen can
act also as an HB acceptor.
We clusterized different structures obtained in the cMDs using principal component
analysis (PCA) as clustering criteria and identify key residues involved in large conformational
movements. For reduced and oxidized ensembles, the first two eigenvectors fall near the origin
of the Cartesian axis, suggesting that the systems are sampling conformations close to the ones
observed in the crystallographic structures. Moreover, the overlap of the root-mean-square inner
product (RMSIP) value of 0.4, denotes a low similarity of the overall dynamics ​[24]​. It is worthy
to note that the essential subspace in each conformational substate is expected to change due to
the conformational restriction imparted by the disulfide bond between C​P​ and C​R​.
The deprotonated C​P​-thiolate and C​P​-sulfenate species keep nearly unchanged with
respect to the starting structure, establishing ionic interactions with Thr57 and Arg132. Although
the protonated forms transiently got closer between the catalytic Cys residues, in any case, local

unfolding transitions were observed, as judged by the secondary structure analysis (SSC, data not
shown). This observation suggests that the thiolate species, that is the most abundant form under
physiological conditions and reactive one, contributes to the stability of FF conformations.
For the disulfide bond formation, two things must occur: the approximation of catalytic
Cys residues and also the loss of secondary structure, with a concomitant increment in local
fluctuation. When cMD simulations started from the LU conformation, the deprotonated species,
particularly the C​P​-thiolate system, present a maximum peak with a C​P​-C​R distance of 5.6 ± 0.3
Å, close to the starting distance at the beginning of the simulation (Figure 4, right panel).
Nevertheless, fully refolding events compatible with the FF conformation was not observed in
any case. These results are interesting because, although the form that reacts with C​R is the
sulfenic acid form of C​P​, the sulfenate species would remain closer to the C​R​, transiently
stabilizing the LU conformation, necessary for the reaction. Additionally, it has been found that
although the preferent reaction is between C​P sulfenic and C​R thiolate, the reaction with the C​P
sulfenate also occurs ​[23]​.

corresponds to the mean ± 1σ of the multimodal Gaussian fit.
Exploring the FF→LU Conformational Transition by Accelerated MD Simulations
Helix-coil transitions usually involve surpassing high energy barriers, thus cMD
simulations become insufficient to study this kind of conformational rearrangements. To
overcome this obstacle, we employed accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations, an
enhanced sampling technique that extends the effective simulation time scale to the order of
microseconds ​[25]​. Due to the unknown value of the energy barrier involved in the FF➝LU
process, four multiples λ values of the acceleration factor α were applied to the ​Ec​TPx
C​P​-sulfenic acid in the FF conformation system ranging from 0.3 to 4.0 collecting a total
1.75x10​9 simulation steps, equivalent to a computational cost of 3.5 μs. Although at λ = 0.3 the
system shows a more spread out map along the first two eigenvectors compared with the cMD
simulation (Figure 5A), the conformations sampled in the cluster of maximal frequency are still
similar to those sampled by the cMD simulation, as pointed out by the low value of the average
ΔRMSD of 0.5 Å, a RMSIP value of 0.7 and a C​P​-C​R distance of 12.2 ± 0.8 Å between Cα
atoms. Interestingly, multiple solvent exposure events of the C​P residue were observed at λ = 1.0
characterized by a ΔSASA of 88.2 ± 20.2 Å​2​. Nevertheless, this was not accompanied by a
significant local unfolding of the ​α​H2 neither an approach of the catalytic Cys which keep at an
average distance of 12.1 ± 0.7 Å (Figure 5B). This fact could indicate that the Cys approximation
and the concomitant condensation of the disulfide bond, involves two independent stages where
the unfolding of one of the helices does not induce the unfolding of the other. Similar results

evidencing significant changes in the SSC of αH2 or αH3 (Figure 5C).
It is worth to note that an increase in λ parameter (​i.e. a decrease in the acceleration factor
α) will result in a decrease in ΔV(​r)​ (the boost potential) and then, a longer simulation time will
be needed to properly sample the protein conformational space ​[26]​. For this reason, a
microsecond time scale simulation was performed at λ = 4.0. The bidimensional heatmap shows
more populated minima besides the crystallographic basin (Figure 5D). To characterize the
conformations accumulated in each energy minimum, a clustering analysis over the projection of
the covariance matrix in the accelerated simulation was conducted. Five minima clusters
preserving native and non-native signatures were found at λ = 4.0 and four of them are
characterized to hold conformations which are far away from the crystallographic FF
conformational substate. The conformations clustered in the well 1 have a slight shift in the
position of αH2 and a twist of 40° in the αH3 refereed to the cMD simulation with no significant
loss of helicity. For wells 2 to 5, a drastic sheet-to-helix transition involved the antiparallel β3-β4
(residues 22 to 44) to an α-helix was formed. The loss of the β3-β4 interactions affects the local
dynamics of β7 which is in close proximity with the αH3 helix. Nevertheless, a similar behaviour
was observed for αH2 and αH3 than
in the well 1. Well 3 holds structures in which the helix
​
observed in the wells 2-5 breaks into 2 parallel α-helix with a partial unfolding of αH3 and
interestingly near 70 % of the conformations have the catalytic Cys at less than 4 Å.
Surprisingly, a complete loss of secondary structure of the αH3 helix was found in well 4 but the
average C​P​-C​R distance remained at 12.1 ± 0.8 Å and only 5 % of the conformers the catalytic

were subjected to 100 ns of cMD simulation using a distance restraint of 3.5 Å between the Cα
atoms of C​P and C​R​. Then four aMD simulation replicas (7.5x10​7 simulation steps ​per replica,
equivalent to 150 ns) were performed for each system using the last structure as initial
coordinates for the unrestricted simulations assigning new random velocities.
The analysis of the simulation of the C​P​P​-C​R​P system showed an ensemble population
with a local RMSD of 2.2 Å and a C​P​-C​R distance distribution of 12.4 ± 0.8 Å between Cα atoms
(Figure 6). The analysis of the helical content ​per residue (Figure 7A) through the simulations,
revealed that the protonation of C​R rises the helical propensity of the first segment of αH3
comprising the residues 87 to 90, to more than 90 % on the whole trajectory. Furthermore, when
the simulations were analyzed in three sections: the first part (0-50 ns), seconds part (50-100 ns),
and the third part (100-150 ns) we observed that during the last part of the simulations (100-150
ns) the helical structure of the complete αH3 (residues 87-96) was acquired (Figure 7A). On the
other hand, when both Cys residues were modeled as thiolate (system IV, C​P​D and C​R​D​), the
stabilization of helical structure for the first seven residues of αH3 (residues 87-93) was
significantly reduced. Intermediate behaviors were observed for systems II and III which have
one Cys as thiolate and the other as thiol (C​P​P​-C​R​D​ and C​P​D​-C​R​P​, Figures 6 and 7).
Deprotonated Cys residues established ionic pair interactions with Arg92, Arg65 (in the
case of C​P​) and Arg132 (in the case of C​R​, Figure 7B). These interactions presumably impede the
helical structure acquisition, or at least delay its induction, stabilizing the LU conformations and
keeping the system trapped, suggesting that the protonation state of the C​P residue is a key
feature for the modulation of the equilibrium between the LU and FF conformations. Noticeably,

with the protein core (Figure 8, left panel). Noticeably, the second half of αH3 helix (residues 93
to 97), containing the C​R​, is stabilized by only one interaction between Glu97 and Arg65. On the
other hand, in the LU ensemble, three HB are formed in the same region: two HB between the
side chain N​ζ of Arg65 with the backbone oxygen of Glu97 and C​P​, and one between the
backbone oxygen of Phe93 with the backbone N-amide of Glu97; plus the covalent disulfide

simulations. Variants R92G, F93G, and E97G showed RMSD values of 1.3 ± 0.2 Å, 1.6 ± 0.2 Å
and 1.9 ± 0.3 Å, respectively. However, significant changes occurred, as inferred by the SSC

Discussion
The study of connections among protein structure, conformational stability, protein
dynamics and function is currently an area of intense efforts. The relationships among these
key-features define the energy-functional landscape of proteins and comprehend how it occurs is
critical to understand enzyme catalysis. Proteins and pathways that include enzymes belonging to
thioredoxin (TRX) superfamily have been well established as system models for this kind of
studies. Members with very different structural features, mechanisms of action and activities
have been studied. In this context, we decided to study experimentally and computationally the
enzyme ​Ec​TPx, a protein that shares the TRX fold and emerges as an interesting case in the Prx
subfamily.
The protein was successfully overexpressed in ​E. coli and purified to homogeneity, and
further analyzed under reduced and oxidized conditions in experimental and computational
studies. Although the enzyme was previously described as a dimer, as suggested by
ultracentrifugation experiments at high concentrations (above 40 µM, ​[8]​), our results
demonstrate that, close to physiological conditions and in both redox states, it behaves as a
monomer (Figure 2D). The oligomeric features and its influence on the different functions of
Prxs is a matter of debate ​[3,29,30]​. Most Prxs behave as homo-oligomers (dimers, decamers,
etc.) and changes in the quaternary structure are very dependent on a variety of experimental or
cellular conditions ​[31,32]​. Nevertheless, a few reports on members of the TPx and PrxQ
subfamilies have already shown by applying different techniques that some Prxs behave as

monomers, such as the case of ​BsT
​ Px ​[19]​, PrxQ from ​Arabidopsis thaliana ​[33] and PrxQ B
from ​Mycobacterium tuberculosis ​[34]​. Although key secondary structure rearrangements linked
to protein function are present when comparing different redox states of ​EcT
​ Px, no significant
differences in unfolding free energies were observed under reducing and oxidizing conditions.
Remarkably, this behavior contrasts with that observed for ​Ec​TRX enzyme, the oxidoreductase
partner of ​Ec​TPx in the catalytic cycle (see Figure 1B). When both redox states of the ​Ec​TRX
are compared no conformational change are present and only subtle changes in internal motions
are observed ​[16,35,36]​, whereas the difference in the free energy of unfolding for oxidized state
is significantly higher than the corresponding to the reduced state (Δ​G​o​NU, H2O ox - Δ​Go​​ NU, H2O red​=
3.5 kcal mol​-1 at 25 °C, ​[37,38]​). More experiments should be done to understand why such
different behaviors were selected through evolution and to elucidate if there is a thermodynamic
connection between both proteins.
Structural evidence provided by X-ray crystallography concerning different states of
AhpC from ​Salmonella typhimurium initially allowed to infer the existence of complex
relationships between conformational exchange and activity, pointing to the existence of at least
two different and functionally relevant native substates ​[20]​. In the case of the TPx subfamily,
the catalytic reaction comprises a partial local unfolding/refolding event of two non-consecutive
alpha-helical elements, bringing the intermediate C​P​-SOH and C​R species close enough to react,
yielding a disulfide bond and releasing a water molecule (see Figure 1B). This suggests that
conformational exchange and catalysis are coupled. In particular, the crystallographic structures
of reduced and oxidized states of ​EcT
​ Px have shed light on the conformation of the native
substates FF and LU. However, no sufficient in-depth dynamic and mechanistic information

concerning the conformational transition and protein motions involved is available at the
molecular level.
We investigated the FF➝LU and LU➝FF conformational transitions of ​Ec​TPx by
computational methods. Conventional MDs allowed us to explore different substates of the
conformational landscape. In addition, the different oxidation and protonation states of the
catalytic Cys residues involved in the reaction were evaluated. This approach was insufficient to
investigate the conformational transition. However, the implementation of aMD allowed an
enhancing of conformational sampling. Using this technique, we observed the LU➝FF refolding
transition suggesting that the process involves high energetic barriers.
It will be very important to study the molecular nature of the barrier, and the degree of
coupling between the internal motions, conformational stability of the helical secondary structure
elements and the speed of the resolution steps (conformational transition and disulfide bond
formation). Our computational results allowed us the study of the LU➝FF refolding process, but
the FF➝LU transition was not observed as such. This conclusion is in agreement with
experimental results regarding the secondary structure content (circular dichroism), that
indicated that in equilibrium under reducing conditions, an increase in the helical content is
observed, which is compatible with the stabilization of the FF ensemble, relative to the LU
ensemble, in aqueous solution. Similar behaviors were previously observed for the atypical
2-Cys TPx from ​H. pylori​ ​[20]​ and 2-Cys PrxQ B from ​M. tuberculosis​ ​[34]​.
One of the main questions concerning Prx activity is whether the oxidation/protonation
state of the C​P might trigger the conformational transition or, on the other hand, there is an
inherent equilibrium between FF and LU conformations independent of the oxidation and/or

26

protonation state of C​P and C​R​. The available data in the literature is controversial. Some results
support the idea that LU conformations can be reached only upon C​P oxidation to sulfenic acid
[39]​, while others suggest that the FF/LU equilibrium is independent of the oxidation state of C​P
[33,40]​, but in any case, it could be very dependent on each particular Prx. To shed light on this
debatable issue, starting from FF and LU conformations, we modeled C​P in the thiol, thiolate,
sulfenic acid and sulfenate species and subjected to microsecond long cMD simulations. Our MD
results suggest that the thiolate species of C​P stabilize the FF conformations. This idea is in
agreement with the fact that the FF conformations are capable to bind and react with the peroxide
substrate ​[41] since the p​K​a value of C​P is typically below 7 ​[42,43]​. ​However, when aMDs were
carried out from the LU conformations we observed that the thiolate form of the Cys residues
may establish ionic par interactions that stabilize the LU conformations. On the other hand, when
Cys residues were protonated the LU to FF transition occurred. It is interestingly to note that
when the disulfide bond of a Prx (in the LU conformations) is reduced by an oxidoreductase (​e.g.
TRX), consecutive thiol/disulfide exchange reactions release C​P and the C​R both transiently as
thiolates ​[44–46] and then they could receive a proton from the solvent or a neighboring acidic
residue. Remarkably, C​P and C​R as thiols is the protonation state that favors the return to the FF
conformations in our simulations. Therefore, we inferred that the deprotonation of the Cys
residues can modulate the energetics of the conformational exchange altering the barrier between
both conformational ensembles. Protonated states might favour the LU​➝​FF transition, whereas
deprotonation might stabilize the existing conformation. A major caveat needs to be given at this
point, the reduction reaction and potentially the LU​➝​FF transition happens with the TRX bound
to the Prx, such binding (transiently covalent) will importantly alter the electrostatic and

solvation environment surrounding the TPx disulfide. TRX is negatively charged at neutral pH
(pI = 4.5), the interactions between TPx and TRX are mostly electrostatic and may play a central
role in the refolding process.
The conformational exchange between two substates of the native ensemble that allows
the formation of the disulfide bond in the active site occurs in other Prxs, including the
decameric/dimeric Prx1 and Prx2 in which the reduction of the intersubunit disulfide bonds
results in an increase in the secondary structure content ​[47,48]​. An analogue behaviour was
previously described in detail for PrxQ, an atypical 2-Cys Prx, which is exclusively found in
bacteria, fungi and plants. However, in PrxQ, catalytic Cys is locat​e​d prototypically in αH2 and
typically separated by four residues (C​P​xxxxC​R​), although they can also be functional as 1-Cys
[49]​. Most PrxQ are monomeric and undergo a significant conformational change upon reduction
of the disulfide bond ​[34]​. In the case of ​AtP
​ rxQ, thermal unfolding analysis showed that the
oxidized enzyme exhibited lower conformational stability than that the reduced enzyme (48 and
53 °C, respectively, ​[33]​). For the oxidized state, it was observed a significant increase in the
effective NMR-R​2 relaxation rates in ​AtP
​ rxQ for residues located in the vicinity of the active site

The resolution step (Reaction II, Figure 1), that includes the FF→LU transition, has been
shown to be significantly slower than expected for a reaction between a sulfenic acid and a thiol.
The rate of resolution is differentially regulated in different Prx and sometimes imposes a severe

limitation in the turnover number of Prx ​[23]​. Additionally, changes in the protein sequence can
accelerate the resolution step, this has been shown in the cases of ​Salmonella typhimurium AhpC
W32F (twofold acceleration, ​[50]​), a mycothiol peroxidase from ​Corynebacterium glutamicum
(fivefold acceleration, ​[51]​) and human Prx5 with 22 additional amino acids at the C-terminal
(eightfold acceleration, Semelak ​et al.​ 2019, unpublished results).
Thus, it seems that the conformational exchange between FF and LU substates of the
native state may become a rate limiting and is a key step in the catalytic mechanism of Prx
regardless the location of the Cys residues: (i) same secondary structure element, (ii) different
secondary structure element but located in the same protein subunit, or (iii) Cys residues located
in different subunits. It is expected that different Prxs subfamilies exhibit particularities in the
FF/LU equilibrium, depending on the protein primary sequence and topology features. Whether
or not the molecular characteristics of this step can define important aspects of kinetics is an
important question that should be further studied in detail and in a case-by-case basis.
In addition, mutations that destabilize the FF interaction network (particularly F93G and
E97G) resulted, not only in increasing probabilities of local unfolding events of the αH3, but also
in the modulation of the distance that separates the catalytic Cys residues during a significant
portion of the MD simulations, which are critical to understand the catalytic features of the
enzyme.

(93 × 2.7 cm), previously equilibrated with buffer 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM
NaCl, pH 7.4. Fractions containing ​EcT
​ Px (>95% pure) were pooled and aliquoted for storage at
-20 °C until use.
Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy Characterization
Changes in secondary and tertiary structure content of wild-type ​EcT
​ Px were followed by
the circular dichroism (CD) signal in the far-UV (195 to 260 nm) using a 1.0 mm path-length cell
and in the near-UV (240 to 350 nm) using a 5 mm path-length cell. Measurements were made in
a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp., Tokio, JP). ​EcT
​ Px (8-30 μM final concentration)
were prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.4. Both reduced and oxidized states were
obtained incubating the protein samples for 30 minutes at room temperature in the presence of
1.0 mM DTT or 1.0 mM H​2​O​2​, respectively. After that, DTT or H​2​O​2 was removed by SEC using
a Sephadex G25 matrix (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, US), and the [SH]/[protein] ratios were

checked using DTDPy reagent ​[53] (ε​324nm =

at 25 ± 0.1 °C using a Peltier system and a speed scan of 50 nm min​-1 with a time constant of 0.5

the number of peptide bonds, and ​L​ is the path length in centimeters.
Steady-state Chemical-induced Unfolding Followed by Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
Equilibrium unfolding experiments were carried out incubating the reduced and oxidized
state of ​Ec​TPx (25 μM) with increased concentrations of urea up to 7.0 M in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1
mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and incubated at room temperature for 5 hours. In the case of
the reduced ​EcT
​ Px, 0.5 mM DTT was added to the buffer to keep reduced conditions. The
unfolding process was followed by far-UV CD spectroscopy at 222 nm using a path length
cuvette of 0.1 cm as a function of time during at least 200 seconds. All measurements were
carried out at 25 ± 0.1 °C. In addition, the far-UV CD spectra at intervals of 1.0 M denaturant
were recorder to ensure the loss of structure signatures. A two-state unfolding mechanism (​native
[N]↔​unfolded ​[U]) was fitted to the experimental data to calculate thermodynamic parameters
[55,56]​. The reversibility of the process was checked by dilution in both the reduced and
oxidized conditions (data not shown). The final concentration of denaturant was determined by
refractive index measurements ​[57]​ using a Palm Abbe digital refractometer (​Misco)​ .

Oligomeric State in Solution
Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed in a FPLC system equipped with
an UV absorption detector (Jasco Corp., Tokio, JP) and MALLS detector. SEC experiments were
carried out using a Superose 12 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, US) column equilibrated in 50 mM
Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl pH 7.4 prepared in milliQ water and filtered through a 0.22 μm pore
size filter. The flow rate was set to 0.3 mL min​-1 and the injection volume was 100 μL. Protein
samples were prepared at 10x (1 mg mL​-1​) to the desired concentration in equilibrium buffer and
centrifuged at top speed before injection. In all cases, three independent experiments were
performed at room temperature. Data processing was performed using the ASTRA 6.0 software
(Wyatt Technology, ​[58]​).
Computational Characterization of the FF and LU Conformational States

Conventional Molecular Dynamics Protocol
The atomic coordinates of the reduced (fully folded, FF conformation) and disulfide
bonded (locally unfolded, LU conformation) wild-type ​Ec​TPx were retrieved from the RCSB
Protein Data Bank under the accession codes 3HVV and 3HVS at 1.75 Å and 1.80 Å of
resolution, respectively ​[13]​. Both crystallographic structures were renumbered throughout this
work starting from serine 1 in both cases.
The protonation and oxidation state of the peroxidatic Cys (C​P​60) was changed to model
different species of interest ​(see Table 1). The thiol and thiolate protonation state of C​P were
modeled by the parameters provided in the AMBER package ​[59]​. The parameters for the

sulfenic acid species were taken from Defelipe ​et al. ​[60]​. The parameters for the sulfenate
species were kindly provided by Dr. Jenner Bonanata (Universidad de la República, Montevideo,
Uruguay). The protonation state of the rest of the ionizable residues was set to the corresponding
state at neutral pH. The initial coordinates were solvated with the 3-particle TIP3P water model
[61] in a cubic box, which extended 10-15 Å further of the nearest protein atom. The set of
parameters for alkali halide ions created by Joung and Cheatham ​[62,63] were used to balance
the total charge of the simulation box. A standard minimization protocol was applied to the
resulting structures to remove any clashes for 1000 steps of steepest descent followed by 1000
steps of conjugate gradient minimization procedure in the canonical ensemble (NVT) using
periodic boundary conditions. The systems were heating up from 100 K to 300 K, using the
Berendsen thermostat ​[61] to suppress fluctuations of the kinetic energy of the system with a
relaxation constant of 2 ps and subsequently switched to constant isotropic-isobaric (NpT)
conditions to allow the density to equilibrate around ~1 g cm​-3 using the Montecarlo barostat.
The SHAKE algorithm ​[64] was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen atoms, then 2 fs time
step was settled. An 8 Å cutoff radius for range-limited interactions with the particle mesh ​Ewald
summation ​[65] for long-range electrostatic interactions was used. Harmonic positional restraint
of strength 20 kcal mol​-1 Å​-2 on Cα atoms was applied during minimization and equilibration and
subsequently removed in four successive simulation stages (10, 5, 2 and 0 kcal mol​-1 Å​-​2​) of 5 ns
each. Unrestrained cMD simulations were performed with the Amber14 ​[59] suite using the
pmemd​.CUDA engine for the graphics processing unit (GPU) code ​[66,67] in a GeForce
GTX780 (Nvidia) equipped cluster and the ​ff14SB force field ​[68]​. Conventional MD runs were

Accelerated Molecular Dynamic Simulation Protocol
Accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) is a biased method that enhances conformational
sampling ​[69]​, promoting the search for low frequency events in biomolecules by adding a
non-negative boost potential ΔV(​r​) to the true potential energy function V(r) when this is lower
than a pre-defined energy level E ​[25,70,71]​. Such that, the potential surfaces are raised near the
minima and unchanged near the saddle points giving as a result, a decrease in the global potential
energy barriers. The biased potential function ​V*​ (​r​) is as follows (Equation 2-3):

(2)

(3)
Where ​EPot
​ and ​E​D are the average potential and dihedral energies obtained by a cMD simulation,
V(​r)​ and V​D(​​ r)​ are the normal potential and torsion potential, respectively, and α​Pot and α​D are the
acceleration factors for the potential and dihedral energies, respectively. ​The dual-boost method
was used in all aMD simulations. ​E​Pot​, ​E​D ,​ α​Pot​ and α​D​ are defined as follows:
(4)

(5)

The values of ​a and ​b used in the present work were 0.2 and 3.5 kcal mol​-1 residue​-1​, respectively.
Natoms
​
and ​N​residue are the total atoms of the system and the number of residues of the protein,

respectively. In order to modify the dihedral boost potential, the 𝜆 parameter was adjusted as
described in Equation 5.
General Post-processing Analysis
Time evolution of the protein secondary structure was calculated with the DSSP
algorithm ​[28] of Kabsch and Sander implemented in the ​cpptraj routine ​[72] of AmberTools15.
Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) was calculated using the vmdICE plug-in ​[73] for VMD
1.9.2. The hydrogen bond (HB) network of the cMD trajectories was calculated using the
Python-based HBonanza script ​[27] and visualized using the provided ​Tcl script for VMD 1.9.2
[74]​. The analysis was performed over 2000 frames (200 ns of cMD simulation) setting a
donor-acceptor distance of 3.0 Å and hydrogen-donor-acceptor angle of 30 degrees. In order to
obtain the most stable HBs along the trajectory, all HBs that were formed less frequently than 50
% of the simulation time were discarded. All protein representations were prepared in VMD
1.9.2 ​[74]​.
Principal Component Analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the widest techniques used for the study of
the conformational space of protein dynamics ​[75,76]​. PCA is a quasi-harmonic analysis
involving a linear combination to transforms the original dataset of correlated variables into an
uncorrelated reduced dimension and the interatomic distance fluctuation covariance matrix ​C​ij is
constructed as follows (Equation 6):

where ​x​i,j are the Cartesian atomic coordinates of the atom ​i,j and ‹​xi​ ​› and ‹​x​j›​ denote the average
coordinates position over the trajectory. After diagonalization of the covariance matrix, a set of
eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues are obtained. The orthogonal eigenvectors set
describe axes of the maximal variance of the distribution of conformations, and the eigenvalues
provide the variance of atomic positional fluctuations contained along each eigenvector. The
root-mean-square inner product ​[77,78] (RMSIP) is a measure for the similarity between the ​N
modes of the covariance matrix of two-mode subspaces obtained by PCA and is calculated by
Equation 7:

(7)
here η​i and υ​j are the ​ith​ and ​j​th eigenvectors of each subspace and ​n i​ s the number of eigenvectors
evaluated. The two limit values of RMSIP are 0 and 1, where 0 means mutually orthogonal
eigenvectors whereas the unity means identical subspaces. In general terms a value of 0.7 is
considered an excellent correspondence, a score of 0.5 is fair and below is considered no
correlation ​[77]​. The first 10 eigenvectors were used along this work.
