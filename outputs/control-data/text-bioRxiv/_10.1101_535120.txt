Summary
The transition to reproduction is a crucial step in the life cycle of any organism. In
Arabidopsis thaliana the establishment of reproductive growth can be divided into two
phases: In the first phase, cauline leaves with axillary meristems are formed and
internode elongation begins. In the second phase, lateral meristems develop into
flowers with defined organs. Floral shoots are usually determinate and suppress the
development of lateral shoots. Here, we describe a Ds transposon insertion mutant in
the Nossen (No-0) accession with severe defects in floral development and flower
morphology. The most striking aspect is the outgrowth of stems from the axillary
bracts of the primary flower carrying terminal secondary flowers. Therefore, we
named this mutant flower-in-flower (fif). However, the insertion of the transposon in
the annotated gene is not responsible for the fif phenotype. By means of classical
and genome sequencing-based mapping, the mutation responsible for the fif

phenotype was found to be in the LEAFY (LFY) gene. The mutation, a G-to-A
exchange in the second exon of LFY, creates a novel lfy allele and causes a
cysteine-to-tyrosine exchange in the α1-helix of the LFY DNA-binding domain.
Whereas subcellular localization and homomerization are not affected, the DNAbinding of LFYFIF is abolished. We propose that the amino acid exchange interferes
with the cooperative binding of LFY to its target DNA. To generate the strong fif
phenotype, LFYFIF may act dominant-negatively by either forming non-binding
LFY/LFYFIF heteromers or by titrating out the interaction partners, required for LFY
function as transcription factor.

a novel allele of the LEAFY gene

Introduction
The development of flowers is indispensable for the reproductive success of
angiosperm plants. During vegetative growth, the shoot apical meristem (SAM)
develops leaves and/or branches, the latter with their own SAMs. After the switch to
reproductive growth, the apical meristems give rise to flowers. Floral development
differs crucially from vegetative shoot growth, as the flower possesses several types
of organs of which the number, arrangement and morphology are species-specific.
Furthermore, the development of lateral shoots is inhibited in flowers and floral
shoots are determinate after the last reproductive organs have been initiated (Piñeiro

and Coupland, 1998; Ma, 1998; Pidkowich et al., 1999). Thus, the coordination of
complex molecular processes is necessary for successful floral development.
There has been significant progress in recent years towards understanding the
molecular mechanisms underlying flower formation. Central to this was the
identification and cloning of the genes that initiate and maintain floral development in
plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana. The most intriguing discovery was the
Arabidopsis loss-of-function mutants with structures that are intermediate between
floral and vegetative shoots. The cloning of the corresponding genes revealed the
existence of the master regulators required for the floral initiation process (FLIP). To
date, five FLIP regulatory master genes are known: LEAFY (LFY), APETALA1 (AP1),
CAULIFLOWER (CAL), APETALA2 (AP2) and UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO)
(Pidkowich et al., 1999). LFY and AP1 play a primary role in initiating the floral
program, as the corresponding loss-of-function mutants do not generate shoots with
floral characteristics and the ectopic expression of either gene induces precocious
flower formation (Irish and Sussex, 1990; Huala and Sussex, 1992; Bowman et al.,
1993). Based on its amino acid similarity and expression characteristics CAL appears
to be functionally redundant to AP1 (Kempin et al., 1995). LFY, AP1 and CAL encode
for transcription factors and are expressed predominantly in floral primordia (Weigel
et al., 1992; Mandel et al., 1992; Kempin et al., 1995).
During plant vegetative growth, LFY expression increases in newly formed leaves
until a certain threshold is reached (Bowmann et al., 1993). LFY then induces the
expression of AP1/CAL genes by binding to the AP1/CAL promoters. Through their
mutual transcriptional up-regulation, LFY and AP1/CAL cooperate to cause the floral
transition (Blazquez et al., 2006). Once the floral meristem is established, the FLIP
gene functions govern its spatial patterning by inducing the expression of the floral
homeotic ABC genes, such as AP2, AP3, Pistillata (PI) and AGAMOUS (AG). The

ABC gene functions in turn control the identity of the stereotypically arranged
Arabidopsis floral organs (Coen and Meyerowitz, 1991; Lohmann and Weigel, 2002).
In the course of our study of the influence of abiotic stress on flower symmetry, we
searched for novel insertion mutants with defects in floral development or
morphology in different Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We focused on genes that
had not yet been linked to flowering. A Ds transposon insertion mutant, which
developed secondary inflorescences with partially aberrant flowers, was identified in
the No-0 accession . The wild-type allele of the gene carrying the Ds transposon
codes for a cystein/histidine-rich C1 domain protein (Shinya et al., 2007; Miwa et al.,
2008). However, a thorough genetic analysis revealed that the transposon-inserted
allele is not the cause of the observed floral phenotype. Using classical mapping and
mapping-by-sequencing, we eventually found a novel mutant allele of LFY to be
responsible for the aberrant floral development and flower morphology and
determined the molecular reason for LFY malfunction.

Results
The flower-in-flower (fif) transposon insertion line displays a novel flower
phenotype
In order to identify novel Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defects in flowering we
screened the RIKEN Arabidopsis Phenome Information Database (RAPID; Kuromori
et al., 2006). RAPID also covers a Ds transposon mutant collection in the Arabidopsis
Nossen-0 (No-0) background (Ito et al., 2002; Kuromori et al., 2004). We identified a
transposon-tagged line (15-3794-1), which developed secondary inflorescences with
partially aberrant flowers (Fig. 1a). Because of this phenotype, we named this novel
Arabidopsis mutant flower-in-flower (fif).

As shown in Figure 1c and d, wild-type Arabidopsis flowers does not have bracts but
consist of four concentric rings of 4 sepals, 4 petals, 6 stamens and 2 fused carpels.
In contrast, the primary flower of the fif mutant had bracts as well as sepals but the
petals were incompletely developed or entirely missing (Fig. 1b, e). In addition, there
were either no stamens or the stamens displaying an aberrant development (Fig. 1b,
e). Furthermore, there were more than 2 carpels per flower, which were not or only
partially overgrown and did not establish fertile ovaries. Most obvious, however, was
the outgrowth of stems from the axillary meristems of the bracts, which carried
terminal secondary flowers. A few secondary fif flowers showed a wild-type-like
phenotype and were, thus, fertile (Fig. 1b, e).
Furthermore, the fif mutant plant displayed a bushy habitus compared to wild-type
No-0 (Fig. 2a, b). This bushy appearance was due to an enhanced number of stemborn side branches compared to wild-type No-0, whereas the number of rosette-born
side shoots was the same in fif and wild-type No-0 plants (Fig. 2c). In addition, fif
mutant plant exhibited delayed flowering compared to wild-type No-0 (Fig. 2a, b).

The transposon insertion is not responsible for the fif phenotype
According to the RIKEN RAPID and our own genotyping results, the Ds transposon
was located in the second exon of the gene At1g20990 that codes for a putative
cysteine/histidine-rich C1 domain protein with an as yet unknown function. To
validate the causal relationship between the fif phenotype and the Ds transposon
insertion, we analysed an independent insertion mutant in the Arabidopsis thaliana
Col-0 background, which exhibited a T-DNA insertion in the promoter region of
At1g20990 (SALK_073291; Alonso et al., 2003). However, homozygous mutant
plants of this line showed no aberrant phenotype compared to wild-type (Col-0) with
respect to floral development, flower morphology, flowering time and growth habitus.

This observation raised doubts as to whether there is a functional link between the
Ds transposon insertion and the fif mutant phenotype. We therefore performed a (co-)
segregation analysis by backcrossing the fif mutant with wild-type No-0 in both
directions (♀fif x ♂No-0, ♀No-0 x ♂fif). Irrespective of the direction, the crosses were
successful as demonstrated by PCR on genomic DNA extracted from F1 plants using
Ds transposon- and At1g20990-specific primers (Figure S1). All tested F1 plants
were heterozygous for the Ds transposon and wild-type At1g20990 and displayed
wild-type floral organs and growth habiti (Figure S1). Therefore, the mutation that
causes the fif phenotype is recessive. Next, six F1 plants were self-fertilized and 20
to 30 progenies each analysed for their pheno- and genotypes. As shown in figure 3,
around one quarter of the F2 plants displayed the fif phenotype indicating that it is
caused by a single mutant gene. Intriguingly, our genotyping results showed that the
Ds transposon insertion did not co-segregate with the fif phenotype: 29 % of the fif
phenotype-displaying plants did not contain the transposon, an additional 49%
contained the transposon insertion only heterozygously (Figure 3). These results
prove that the Ds insertion into the At1g20990 locus does not cause the fif
phenotype.

The fif phenotype is caused by a novel allele of LEAFY (LFY)
To identify the mutant locus genetically responsible for the fif phenotype, we
combined a classical mapping (Neff et al., 2002; Kover et al., 2009; Pacurar et al.,
2012) with a mapping-by-sequencing approach (James et al., 2013; Schneeberger,
2014). To establish a mapping population, fif mutant plants (No-0) were crossed in
both direction with plants of the Col-0 accession. Irrespective of the crossing
direction, all the F1 plant displayed a wild-type phenotype (Figure S2a). Eight F1
plants were self-fertilized and 1582 F2 plants characterized phenotypically. In

accordance with the self-crossing results described above, around 25 % of the F2
plants (437 of the 1582) showed the fif phenotype (Figure S2b). Leaf material was
harvested from 425 of the 437 F2 plants in groups of 15 to 20 individuals; in addition
leaf material from 200 F2 plants was collected individually. Genomic DNA was
extracted and used for classical mapping. Using chromosome-specific INsertion and
DELetion (INDEL) markers (Pacurar et al., 2012) the mutant locus was mapped to
the q-arm of chromosome 5 (Figure 4a). Two additional INDEL markers and two
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) based Derived Cleaved Amplified
Polymorphic Sequences (dCAP) markers (Kover et al., 2009; Neff et al., 2002) limited
the Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) responsible for the fif phenotype to the terminal
end of chromosome 5´s q-arm (Figure 4b, dCAP S5-24: 99% No-0).
To establish the exact localization of the mutant locus, we deep-sequenced the total
genome of 245 homozygous fif mutant plants derived from the fif (No-0) x WT (Col-0)
crosses described above, and determined the frequencies of No-0 and Col-0 alleles
along the chromosomes. Whereas the heterozygous distribution of No-0 and Col-0
sequences was found to be equal with respect to chromosomes 1 to 4 (Figure S3ad), there was a very significant deviation towards No-0 sequences at the terminal end
of chromosome 5 (Figure 5a). A detailed examination of this 300 kb stretch revealed
100 % identity with the No-0 sequence (Figure 5b). This sequence stretch conformed
with the QTL identified by classical mapping.
A detailed comparison of the fif and wild-type No-0 sequence in this 300 kb stretch
revealed a single SNP, which did not result in a silent mutation but caused a change
in a codon. This SNP was also found in all the 143 individually tested fif mutant plants
and reflected a single guanine-to-adenine exchange in the second exon of the
LEAFY (LFY) gene (At5g61850, Figure 5c). This mutation caused a cysteine-totyrosine amino acid exchange at position 263 in the DNA-binding domain of the LFY

protein (Figure 5d). To prove that this point mutation causes the fif phenotype, we
transformed the fif mutant (No-0) with constructs expressing LFY-GFP or LFYFIF-GFP
under the control of the 35S promoter. Whereas the expression of LFY-GFP
complemented the fif mutant phenotype almost completely, there was no
complementation with LFYFIF-GFP (Figure S4).

LFYFIF impairs DNA-binding capability but shows wild-type intracellular
localization and homomerization
Having identified a new LFY allele to be responsible for the fif phenotype, we next
analysed the putative consequences of the Cys263-to-Tyr exchange for LFY protein
properties at molecular and cell biological levels.
To test a putative alteration in subcellular localization, C-terminal GFP fusions of wildtype LFY and the mutant LFY version (LFYFIF) were expressed under the control of
the Arabidopsis ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10) promoter in transiently transformed Nicotiana
benthamiana epidermal leaf cells. The functionality of C- (and N-terminal) GFP
fusions of LFY was previously shown by the genetic complementation of the lfy-12
mutant phenotype (Wu et al., 2003). As shown in figure 6a, LFY-GFP and LFYFIFGFP localised to the cytoplasm and the nucleus in a similar manner. The observed
fluorescence pattern of LFY-GFP and LFYFIF-GFP is in accordance with the pattern
previously reported for their expression in tobacco epidermal leaf cells (Siriwardana
and Lamb, 2012b).
Next, we tested by in vivo FRET-FLIM whether LFY protein-protein interaction, here
especially LFY homomerization (Sirwardana and Lamb, 2012a), was altered. To do
so, C-terminal GFP fusions (FRET donor) and C-terminal RFP fusions (FRET
acceptor) were transiently expressed, either individually (donor only) or in
combination in N. benthamiana epidermal leaf cells and the fluorescence lifetime of

the donor fusion was measured. As shown in figure 6b, the fluorescence lifetimes of
LFY-GFP and LFYFIF-GFP were similar in the absence of the acceptor fusions.
However, the lifetimes of LFY-GFP and LFYFIF-GFP decreased significantly when
they were co-expressed with either LFY-RFP or LFYFIF-RFP demonstrating
homotypic (LFY-LFY, LFYFIF-LFYFIF) and heterotypic (LFY-LFYFIF) homomerization in
planta (Figure 6b). In addition, there was no significant difference in the interaction of
the homotypic and heterotypic homomers (Figure 6b).
The Cys263-to-Tyr exchange is located in the first α-helix of the LFY DNA-binding
domain (Figure 5d). We, therefore, used a quantitative DNA-protein interaction ELISA
approach (qDPI-ELISA; Fischer, Böser et al., 2016) to test whether the mutation
interferes with the DNA-binding capability of LFY in vitro. We expressed N-terminally
GFP-tagged full-length LFY, as well as full-length LFYFIF and GFP, in E. coli
independently and applied the crude extracts containing the fusion proteins or GFP,
in identical amounts, based on the GFP fluorescence and western-blotting, to ELISA
plates in two dilutions. The plates were covered with double-stranded (ds) DNA
oligonucleotides representing either the LFY-binding sequence of the AP1 promoter
(pAP1), a mutated pAP1 version (pAP1m) that is not recognized by LFY (Winter et
al., 2011) a random sequence without any similarity to the LFY binding motif
(C28M12), or were uncovered. The DNA-binding efficiency of the proteins was
recorded by determining the GFP fluorescence of the bound proteins (Fischer, Böser
et al., 2016). GFP-LFY exhibited a specific binding to pAP1 and no binding to any
other oligonucleotide or to the oligonucleotide-free ELISA plate (Figure 7). In
contrast, GFP-LFYFIF, like GFP or the E. coli crude extract without recombinant
protein, was unable to recognize pAP1 or any other oligonucleotide (Figure 7). To
exclude the possibility that the Cys263-to-Tyr exchange may alter the DNA-binding
specificity we used a DPI-ELISA based approach to screen a dsDNA oligonucleotide

library reflecting 4096 randomized DNA hexamers (Brand et al., 2013a, b) with GFPLFY- and GFP-LFYFIF-containing E.coli extracts. Whereas a DNA-binding consensus
sequence was obtained for GFP-LFY (5´-GGGC-3´/3´-CCCG-5`), there was no DNAbinding of GFP-LFYFIF to any oligonucleotide in the library.

Discussion
In our search for novel floral genes in Arabidopsis thaliana we identified the fif Ds
transposon insertion mutant in the No-0 accession in the RIKEN RAPID collection (Ito
et al., 2002; Kuromori et al., 2004). fif mutant plants display a novel floral phenotype
and inflorescence architecture, as they develop aberrant and infertile primary flowers
in combination with short stems that emerge from vegetative meristems in the axillars
of the bracts and carry fertile secondary flowers.
The Ds transposon insertion in the genome of the fif mutant was annotated to gene
At1g20990, which encodes a cysteine/histidine-rich C1 domain protein. However, as
demonstrated by our genetic analysis, the Ds transposon insertion into the
At1g20990 locus is not the cause of the fif phenotype. Obviously, another mutant
locus generated somewhere else in the genome, most likely during transposon
movement, is responsible for the fif phenotype. Using combined classical and
genome sequencing-based mapping approaches, the causal mutation for the fif
phenotype was found to be in the LFY gene. The mutation is a single G-to-A
exchange in the second exon of LFY, creating the novel, recessive lfy allele. The
mutation causes a Cys-to-Tyr exchange at position 263 in the LFYFIF amino acid
sequence.
The cell biological analysis of LFY-GFP and LFYFIF-GFP revealed an intracellular
localization in the cytoplasm and nucleus of tobacco epidermal leaf cells identical to
that previously reported for LFY-GFP (Siriwardana and Lamb, 2012a). Thus, a mis-

localisation cannot be the cause of the LFYFIF malfunction. In addition, as shown by
quantitative FRET-FLIM interaction studies the mutation does not interfere with the
homomerization capacity of LFY. Especially the latter result was to be expected as
the domain essential for homomerization is located at the N-terminus of LFY (amino
acid 46 to 127; Siriwardana and Lamb, 2012a).
However, our quantitative DPI-ELISA assay demonstrated that, in contrast to LFYGFP, LFYFIF-GFP lost its capacity to bind to its DNA target, as it is present, for
instance, in the AP1 promoter (Winter et al., 2011). Furthermore, the DPI-ELISA
based approach for the determination of putative alterations in binding specificity did
not reveal any DNA-binding activity for LFYFIF-GFP.
According to the available crystal structure of the DNA-bound dimer, Cys263 is well
conserved between the LFY homologs of many plant species but has never
previously been reported to be crucial for DNA-binding (Hames et al., 2008).
Intriguingly, Cys263 does not contribute to the physical contact of LFY with DNA;
however, the α1-helix, in which Cys263 is positioned, participates in the cooperative
DNA-binding of LFY, as it facilitates the establishment and stabilization of the DNAbinding domains in the minor and major grove of DNA (Hames et al., 2008).
Therefore, the change of the relatively small Cys to the bulky, aromatic Tyr might
prevent the folding of the α1-helix and thereby strongly restrict the cooperative
binding of LFY to its target DNA.
The total failure of LFYFIF to bind to DNA explains the strong floral phenotype of
especially the primary flowers. LFY is one of the master regulators in the FLIP of
Arabidopsis (and other plant species) and controls, together with other factors and
via a complex regulatory network, the spatiotemporal expression of downstream FLIP
genes and also of the homeotic flower genes required for flower organ formation.
Although only a single amino acid exchange is affected, LFYFIF mirrors in principle

the flower phenotype of known strong lfy alleles. However, of the more than 15
described lfy alleles (Weigel et al., 1992), the six alleles that show such a strong floral
phenotype produce shortened LFY polypeptides caused by either premature stop
codons (lfy-1, lfy-6, lfy-7, lfy-8, lfy-11) or a non-sense frame shift C-terminal of Gln196
(lfy-15). Hence, the strong phenotype of the fif allele needs a different explanation:
LFYFIF may act dominant-negatively by either forming non-functional heteromers with
wild-type LFY, which cannot longer bind to DNA, or by titrating out interaction
partners required for LFY function (Siriwardana and Lamb, 2012b). However, as long
as sufficient wild-type LFY is present in heterozygous plants, the fif mutant shows
recessive inheritance.
The failure of LFYFIF to bind to DNA is also explains the bushy growth architecture of
the fif mutant. It has recently been shown (Chahtane et al., 2013) that mutations in lfy
can cause the emergence of axillary meristems instead of floral meristems resulting
in an enhanced number of side branches. In addition, the ectopic expression of a
nearly full-length LFY version with weaker in vitro DNA-binding capacity and
dramatically reduced in vivo transcriptional activity [LFYHARA(∆40)] in the Col-0
accession causes a bushy phenotype similar to that of the No-0 fif mutant (Chahtane
et al., 2013). Interestingly, the His387-to-Ala and Arg390-to-Ala in LFYHARA(∆40) are
also mooted to interfere with the cooperative binding of LFY to its target DNA as well.
Taken together, our data demonstrate the general importance of Cys263 for LFY
function not only in floral development but also in axillary meristem outgrowth in
Arabidopsis.
Most intriguingly, the fif floral phenotype appears to be specific for the No-0
accession, as, to our knowledge, it has never been reported for the Col-0 or any
other accession. However, the fif phenotype also becomes also manifest in the Col-0
accession when the fif locus of No-0 is transferred to Col-0. This phenomenon might

be explained by differences in the spatio-temporal transcriptional activity of the No-0
and Col-0 LFY loci during vegetative meristem and floral development. Therefore, the
fif phenotype may only be visible in other accessions such as Col-0 when the No-0
locus is artificially introduced into them and drives LFYFIF accumulation.

Experimental procedures
Plant material
Seeds of the homozygous Ds transposon insertion line 15-3794-1 and the
corresponding wild-type accession (No-0) were obtained from the RIKEN Arabidopsis
Phenome Information database (RAPID; Kuromori et al., 2006). Seeds of the
homozygous T-DNA insertion line Salk_073291 and the corresponding wild-type
accession (Col-0) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre
(NASC; Alonso et al., 2003).

Plasmid construction
Using gene-specific primers [sense (S): 5´-caccATGGATCCTGAAGGTTTCACG-3´,
antisense (A): 5´-GAAACGCAAGTCGTCGCCG-3´) the cDNA of LFY was amplified
from pSST14 (gift Jan Lohmann, University of Heidelberg, Germany) and cloned in
pENTR™/D-TOPO®. Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) was performed to produce
the fif cDNA using the following primers (S: 5´CTGTTCCACTTGTACGAACAATaCCGTGAGTTCCTTCTTCAG-3´, A: 5´CTGAAGAAGGAACTCACGGtATTGTTCGTACAAGTGGAACAG-3´). With
Gateway™ LR Clonase™ II Enzyme mix the LFY cDNA was inserted into pUGT1Dest (A. Hahn, unpublished) and pB7RWG2-Dest (Karimi et al., 2002) for plant
expression and into pET-Dest42GFP (Fischer, Böser et al., 2016) for E. coli
expression.

Classical mapping and mapping by genome sequencing
Genetic mapping was accomplished using 100 phenotypic fif plants collected from a
F2 population derived from a cross between fif (No-0) and Col-0. The mapping
strategy and the molecular markers used to identify the causal locus were described
by Păcurar et al. (2012). After mapping of the chromosome arm and next-generation
sequencing (NGS, see below) the point mutation was confirmed by derived cleavedamplified polymorphic sequence primers designed by using the dCAPS Finder 2.0
software (Neff, Turk and Kalishman, 2002). One or two mismatches were introduced
in one of the used primer to incorporate an allele-specific restriction site into the PCR
product. After amplification, the PCR products were digested (enzymes from Thermo
Scientific) following the manufacturer’s recommendations and separated on a 4%
agarose gel. All used markers are listed in table S1.
NGS mapping was performed using a pool of 425 phenotypic fif plants from the
crossing described above. A pool of 40 wild-type No-0 plants was sequenced to
generate a genome-wide marker list and to mine the fif genome for acquired
mutations. Isolation of genomic DNA was performed in groups up to 20 plants using
the DNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s
recommendations. DNA concentration was determined with the use of NanoDrop
ND-1000 and the whole pool composed by using 100 µg DNA of each group.
Sequencing was performed at the Max Planck-Genome-Centre Cologne by a
HiSeq2500 (Illumina) Sequencer producing ~35.000.000 read-pairs for each pool.
Short reads of both pools were respectively aligned against the Col-0 reference
sequence (TAIR10) and SNPs were called using shore pipeline (version v0.8) with
GenomeMapper (version v0.4.4s) with default parameters (Ossowski et al., 2008;
Schneeberger et al., 2009a). Genome-wide SNP markers were defined with filtering
for sequencing coverage and allele frequency using SHOREmap (version 3.0, Sun et

al., 2015; Schneeberger et al., 2009b; Schneeberger, 2014). Sliding window-based
estimation of allele frequencies of the Nos allele in the pooled F2 samples and
identification of a mapping interval were performed with SHOREmap (version 3.0)
using default parameters. Comparison of the consensus calls of both pools in the 300
kb mapping interval revealed the mutation in LFY.

Localization and FRET-FLIM studies
The indicated constructs and p19 as gene silencing suppressor were transformed
into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and infiltrated into Nicotiana
benthamiana leaves. The localization of the fusion proteins was performed 3 days
after infiltration using 488 nm or 561 nm lasers for GFP or RFP excitation,
respectively, at the SP8 laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems GMBH) with
LAS AF and SymPhoTime software using a 63x/1.20 water immersion objective
(Ladwig et al., 2015). FLIM data were derived from measurements of at least 20
probes for each fusion protein combination. To excite LFY-GFP and LFYFIF-GFP for
FLIM experiments, a 470 nm pulsed laser (LDH-P-C-470) was used, and the
corresponding emission was detected with a SMD Emission SPFLIM PMT from 495
to 545 nm by time-correlated single-photon counting using a Picoharp 300 module
(PicoQuant). Each time-correlated single-photon counting histogram was
reconvoluted with the corresponding instrument response function and fitted against
a monoexponential decay function for donor-only samples and a biexponential decay
function for the other samples to unravel the GFP fluorescence lifetime of each
probe. The average GFP fluorescence lifetimes as well as the standard error values
were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2013. To test for homogenity of variance
Levene’s test (df=5/140, F=26.298, p < 0.0001) was used and statistical significance

was calculated by a two-tailed, all-pair Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Steel-Dwass
post hoc correction using JMP version 12.2.0 (Ohmi et al., 2016).

qDPI-ELISA, DPI-ELISA based screening and western blotting
qDPI-ELISA was performed using E.coli crude extracts containing GFP-tagged LFY
or LFYFIF, GFP alone or no fluorescent protein according to Fischer, Böser et al.
(2016). The sequences of the 5´-biotinylated dsDNA oligonucleotides AP1, mAP1
and C28M12 used for the immobilization on Streptavidin-coated 384 well microtiter
plate are displayed in table S2. Before addition to the microtiter plate, the equal
content of GFP-tagged fusion protein in the crude extracts was adjusted according to
the GFP fluorescence using a fluorescence reader (TECAN Safire).
The DPI-ELISA based specificity screening, using a dsDNA oligo array on a 384 well
microtiter plate covering all possible 4096 hexanucleotide DNA motifs was performed
as described previously (Brand et al. 2013a, b).

Figure 7. Comparative analysis of the in vitro DNA-binding capacity of LFY and
LFYFIF using a GFP-fluorescence-based DPI-ELISA approach. GFP-LFY and GFPLFYFIF were expressed in E.coli. After extraction, crude extracts containing either no
recombinant protein (w/o protein) or, based on GFP fluorescence, equal amounts of
GFP or GFP fusion protein were added to ELISA plates covered with either the
double-stranded (ds) DNA oligonucleotide pAP1, which contains a LFY recognition
site, an altered version of pAP1 (pAP1m), in which the recognition site was mutated,
a dsDNA oligonucleotide unrelated to the pAP1 and pAP1m sequences (C28M12) or
