Abstract:

35

Recent advances in animal tracking technology have ushered in a new era in biologging.

36

However, the considerable size of many sophisticated biologging devices restricts their

37

application to larger animals, while old-fashioned techniques often still represent the state-of-

38

the-art for studying small vertebrates. In industrial applications, low-power wireless sensor

39

networks fulfill requirements similar to those needed to monitor animal behavior at high

40

resolution and at low tag weight. We developed a wireless biologging network (WBN), which

41

enables simultaneous direct proximity sensing, high-resolution tracking, and long-range

42

remote data download at tag weights of one to two grams. Deployments to study wild bats

43

created social networks and flight trajectories of unprecedented quality. Our developments

44

highlight the vast capabilities of WBNs and their potential to close an important gap in

45

biologging: fully automated tracking and proximity sensing of small animals, even in closed

46

habitats, at high spatial and temporal resolution.

Introduction

53

Recent advances in animal tracking technology have ushered in a new era in biologging1, 2.

54

By collecting data of unprecedented quantity and quality, automated methods have

55

revolutionized numerous fields including animal ecology3, collective behavior4, migration5,

56

and conservation biology6. For example, automated tracking of animals from space has

57

advanced considerably over the past decade, in particular for observing large-scale

58

movements1. However, satellite communication for localization or data access requires a lot

59

of energy, and heavy transmitters greatly limit our ability to track smaller vertebrate species1.

60

Efforts to further miniaturize increasingly powerful biologging devices culminated in the

61

launch of the ICARUS initiative in 2019, which aims to achieve global animal observation at a

62

small tag weight through a combination of GPS tracking, on-board sensing, energy

63

harvesting, and energy-efficient data access from low space orbit7. ICARUS promises a great

64

step forward in tracking large-scale movements such as migration. GPS tracking, however, is

65

often not ideal or feasible for field biologists studying behavior on smaller spatial scales. GPS

66

tracking of small vertebrate species is further limited by the considerable weight of GPS

67

devices1. Satellite reception is hampered by complex habitats and impossible if animals go

68

inside trees, caves, or underground burrows.

69

In industrial applications or for civilian surveillance, low-power wireless sensor

70

networks (WSNs) fulfill requirements similar to those needed to track animal behavior at high

71

resolution and at low tag weight8. Consistently, there have been numerous applications for

72

WSNs in wildlife monitoring (‘biologging’) since the early 2000s9. In the last decade, more

73

sophisticated approaches have created powerful monitoring systems, e.g., for high-resolution

74

tracking10 and fully automated logging of social encounters11, 12. The major challenge in

75

developing efficient wireless biologging networks (WBNs) is to design ultra-low power

76

communication networks in order to maximize performance, minimize energy consumption,

77

and reduce tag weight.

78
79

Here, we describe a system that takes WBNs to the next level: a multifunctional and
thus Broadly Applicable Tracking System (‘BATS’, Figure 1). We first present a solution for

80

direct proximity sensing that enables the collection of proximity data at a temporal resolution

81

of seconds, at tag weights of one to two grams, and with runtimes of up to several weeks

82

depending on the sampling rate. Second, we describe an adaptive option for triangulating

83

spatial positions based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) by ground-borne localization

84

nodes. This adaptive option allows automated recording of robust movement trajectories

85

even in structurally complex habitats. Third, we explore a new, almost energy neutral solution

86

for remote data access over distances of several kilometers at low data rates. Finally, we

87

present an energy model that shows the effect of the parameter settings of software tasks on

88

the runtime of the animal-borne tag. First deployments of BATS have resulted in proximity

89

and tracking data of unprecedented quality and have demonstrated the high potential of

90

WBNs for studying (social) behavior. Our developments highlight the vast capabilities of

91

WBNs and their potential to close an important gap in biologging: fully automated tracking

92

and proximity sensing of small animals, even in closed habitats, at high spatial and temporal

93

resolution.

94
95

Results

96

The modular structure of BATS allows researchers to combine proximity sensing, long-range

97

telemetry, and high-resolution tracking (Figure 1) depending on the research question and

98

the behavior of the animals. We chose bats to test and validate the system since they are

99

small-bodied and move fast in dense vegetation, both challenges to the performance of the

100

WBN. Three recent field studies were conducted in temperate and tropical habitats on three

101

bat species: greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis), common noctules (Nyctalus noctula)

102

and common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). Each study documented high-resolution

103

proximity data by direct proximity sensing among animals and automatically forwarding data

104

to ground nodes (Figure 1a) that were deployed at roosting or foraging sites. Bat-borne

105

mobile nodes that came within the reception range of the localization grid automatically

106

increased their sampling rate to enable high-resolution localization (Figure 1b). Data for the

107

synchronization of clocks was transmitted successfully over distances of more than 4 km by

long-range telemetry (Figure 1c). The following sections describe the empirical validation of

109

the system.

112

Figure 1: BATS overview. (a) Animal-borne mobile nodes (MNs) document animal-animal

113

meetings, which are triggered by MN-beacons 24/7 and independently of ground

114

infrastructure. Each mobile node forwards its meeting data when it receives beacons from a

115

ground node (GN) that is dedicated to downloading and storing data. (b) When a tagged

116

animal enters a grid of localization nodes (depicted by an antenna with red/blue gain

117

patterns), a beacon of a tracking-dedicated GN triggers the transmission of localization

118

packets from the MN to the localization nodes. Received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) of

119

the impinging localization packets are then sent from the localization nodes to a work station

120

via a WLAN. (c) Long-range bursts, which contain encoded sensor data, are received by

121

long-range receivers. Long-range telemetry enables data transmission over distances of

122

several kilometers at a low data rate.

127

highly dynamic both during day and night. For example, Figure 2a shows the course of the

128

meeting history and the dynamic range of degree centrality for a single bat (ID 56) over a

129

two-day period. The high temporal resolution of meetings (all mobile nodes in reach

130

communicate with each other every two seconds) also makes it possible to infer a behavior

131

such as departure from the roost or movement within the roost. For example, foraging bouts

132

can be identified by a sudden drop in meeting partners at night, which can be verified by

133

contacts to ground nodes outside the roost. Autonomous direct proximity sensing allows

134

monitoring changes in roosting associations, caused by moving among subgroups within the

135

roost (Figure 2b, c) and it also allows inferring ‘social foraging networks’ outside the roost

136

(Figure 2d). In addition, every meeting is labeled with a maximum signal strength intensity

137

indicator (RSSI). This makes it possible to subset the meeting dataset according to signal

138

strength, an estimate for proximity13. RSSI values can distinguish close-contact associations

139

from associations based on merely occupying the same area.

140

The social networks created from direct proximity sensing are independent of the

141

whereabouts of the tagged bats and provide an adaptive temporal resolution of seconds.

142

Almost 400,000 individual meetings were recorded during the first eight days of our field test.

143

To take bats as an example, the typical approach for collecting social network data has been

144

to sample some unknown portion of co-roosting associations in a sample of identified roosts

145

each day14. Our system allows complete networks of all bats every few seconds. This

146

temporal resolution makes changes in social gathering directly visible if time slices in high-

147

resolution data are small enough15. We believe this represents an extraordinary advance for

148

studying such small free-ranging animals, and it allows for an analytical depth which is so far

149

known predominantly from human social networks generated by communication among

150

smart phones or social media15.

RSSI-based localization from angle-of-arrival estimation:
Seventeen wireless localization nodes were used to track tagged 11 mouse-eared

164

bats (Myotis myotis) over an area of approximately 1.5 ha in an old, natural deciduous forest

165

in northern Bavaria (Germany, Forchheim). We were able to reconstruct flight trajectories

166

from foraging mouse-eared bats. Figure 3b shows as an example two trajectories of one

167

foraging mouse-eared bat during two different nights in early August.

168
169

We evaluated the spatial resolution of the tracking system by estimating a trajectory
from a defined reference path using unscented Kalman filters. The reference path and

170

estimated trajectories are shown in Figure 3a. The trajectories were calculated from angle-of-

171

arrival estimates of signals impinging on localization nodes. Angles were estimated from

172

difference measurements of received signal strength (RSS) at two orthogonal antenna gain

173

patterns. This procedure in combination with a set of post-processing techniques for

174

probabilistic multipath mitigation makes the trajectories robust to multipath propagation. The

175

calculated trajectory is based on 4,912 data sets, while one set was composed of up to 2x17

176

RSS difference measurements (one per frequency band), if all 17 localization nodes were

177

within the reception range of the mobile node. For comparison, we also analyzed four tracks

178

recorded by a 15 g heavy-duty Ornitela GPS tracker, which is commonly used for tracking

179

large birds of up to 450 g body weight. The mean positioning error was 7.30 m for the

180

Ornitela GPS tracker and 5.65 m for the trajectory of the BATS system.

181

We calculated the positioning accuracy at lower densities of the localization grid.

182

Localization was less accurate with fewer localization nodes (Figure 4), but it was robust and

183

comparable to the full tracking grid (17 nodes) when using 15 - 16 nodes. With 12 - 14

184

nodes, we observed increasing variation in average error rates. With 11 nodes, the mean

185

error was similar to the results from GPS tracking. Variation increased steadily with lower

186

numbers of nodes and the mean error reached more than 10 m with a maximum error rate of

187

34 m at 6 nodes. At such low grid densities, the localization results tended to diverge,

188

resulting in increasing positioning errors. In addition, sparser grids lack robustness against

189

multi-path scattering. Consequently, the node density may only be reduced to a certain point,

190

while positioning errors remain quite stable (Figure 4).

191

These analyses show that 11 localization nodes over an area of 1.5 ha in a forested

192

habitat might be sufficient to construct high-resolution trajectories comparable in quality to a

193

heavy-duty GPS tracker, which would only last for a few hours using a 15 g device, or to

194

reverse GPS in open desert habitats10. Only moderate resources and human effort are

195

needed to cover an area of a few hectares. For example, a setup as described above

196

consisting of 11 localization nodes is deployed and configured by two people in one to two

197

workdays.

Distance verification of packet transmission by long-range telemetry:

213

Transmission distances of data packages were measured in an urban green area. 34 noctule

214

bats (Nyctalus noctula) were tagged in a forest within the city of Berlin and two long-range

215

telemetry receivers were placed at a distance of about 1 and 4 km from the forest.

216

Mobile nodes transmitted with each MN-beacon a burst for long-range transmission of

217

the mobile node’s time stamp. During a period of two weeks, we were able to receive more

218

than 168,000 long-range bursts, which allowed us to successfully recover 9,511 complete

219

timestamps from 32 individual bats. To mitigate the impairment by interfering transmission,

220

one complete long-range telemetry packet is split over 24 single burst transmissions. At the

221

long-range receiver, 24 subsequent bursts are merged to one actual long-range packet

222

containing the ID and the bat’s time reference. This transmit scheme assures that the mobile

223

node’s transmit module is only activated for a short time period avoiding stress on the

224

batteries and hardware. In addition, it avoids interference of other channels by a time-

225

frequency hopping pattern in transmission. Instead of a complete package loss, only a

226

fraction of the collection of bursts might be corrupted, which can be reconstructed by means

227

of error-correction codes at the receiver side. It is only due to this specialized telegram-

228

splitting technique16 that a long-range transmission under extreme power-restrictions and

229

vastly occupied frequency channels becomes possible.

230

Reception of long-range data should perform best when the tagged bats move in

231

open airspace. However, we recovered a considerable number of these long-range bursts

232

while bats were inside their roosts during the day. 563 long-range bursts received during the

233

day were mapped to the known roosts of the bats, allowing us to measure the transmission

234

distance. Fifty-seven long-range bursts from four bats inside their roost were recovered over

235

distances of ca. 4.2 km (between roost 1 or 2 and the receiver at the cogeneration plant,

236

Supplementary Figure 1). 506 long-range bursts from five tagged bats were recovered at

237

distances between 667 and 819 m (between roost 1 or 3 and the receiver at the retirement

238

home, Supplementary Figure 1). Burst retrieval over distances of more than 4 km was

239

surprising. Theoretical calculations predicted transmission distances of about 5 km assuming

240

barrier-free transmission17. In the field, however, signals had to pass first through the wooden

241

wall of the tree roost and second the forest’s vegetation, which should greatly reduce

242

transmission distance.

243

Data recovery is a major challenge in automated light-weight tracking-systems. Signal

244

transmissions inherently suffer from limited transmission power under heavy losses due to

245

distance, shadowing, and other interfering signals. Remote downlinks, e.g., per GSM (Global

246

System for Mobile Communications), add considerable weight in the form of circuitry and

247

battery1. Many light-weight trackers must therefore be retrieved, or energy harvesting must

248

be used to counter-balance the expenses for remote data download7, 18-20, again adding

249

weight for the required hardware components. When tagged animals move on predictable

250

scales, energy-saving methods like transfer via VHF (Very High Frequency) or radio modems

251

may be an option to receive data over distances of hundreds of meters to few kilometers21.

252

Our scenario explores options to decrease the energy expense for downloading stored data

253

to a negligible proportion of the overall energy budget (compare Figure 5). For data

254

download over short distances of ca. 100m, we accumulate and pre-process data on-board

255

and use sophisticated communication protocols that maximize data-package reconstruction

256

while minimizing energy demand22, 23. The above described long-range telemetry mode

257

provides an option for robust transmission of small amounts of data at a low rate without the

258

expenditure of additional energy due to the hybrid modulation of the signal. In comparison,

259

other long-range systems for biologging, such as LoRa12, enable higher transmission rates.

260

However, the bi-directional communication between transmitter and receiver strongly

261

increases the energy demand no the mobile node.

262
263

Sensor node energy consumption and lifetime

264

A major strength of WBNs is the ease of adjusting parameters such as sampling rate and in

265

turn energy consumption. These adjustments can maximize runtime for a given battery

266

capacity, or alternatively maximize sampling rate to obtain higher resolution data. To

267

investigate the impact of the different software-task parameters on runtime, we derived a

268

model for energy consumption. We computed examples of runtimes of mobile nodes for two

269

battery capacities and different parameter settings (Table 1). For example, the increase in

270

energy consumption when tracking two to four hours per day can be compensated by

271

extending the MN-beacon intervals. We achieve runtimes of at least five days using a 12mAh

272

battery (corresponding to a 1g mobile node) even at the shortest beacon intervals of two

273

seconds (active mode) and with two hours of high-resolution tracking per day. Depending on

274

the parameter settings, we achieve runtimes of up to 13 days using the smaller battery and

275

25 days using 22mAh (Table 1).

disabled (i.e., only proximity sensing), sending out beacons to wake up other mobile nodes to

287

initiate meetings strongly drives the energy demand (Figure 5a, b). Therefore, modifying the

288

MN-beacon intervals has the highest impact on runtime. When localization is enabled,

289

tagged animals send localization packages whenever they enter the tracking grid. The high

290

duty-cycle of sending localization packages (8/s) strongly decreases the runtime (Figure 5c-

291

e, Table 1). At active/inactive MN-beacon intervals of 2/10s, a daily localization period of two

292

hours decreases the overall runtime by 10.8% (Fig 5 a, c, Table 1). At four hours of

293

localization, the energy demand for localization dominates the overall energy consumption, in

294

particular at high MN-beacon intervals.

Figure 5: Energy distribution of software tasks of a mobile node powered by a 22mAh

297

battery. Energy demand per software task depends on parameter settings for active/inactive

298

beacon interval [s] and amount of time an animal spends in the localization grid [h]. The

299

energy demand is shown for the seven major software tasks; MN = mobile node, GN =

300

ground node. Zero time in the localization grid (a, b) refers to a pure proximity sensing

301

scenario.

302
303

Model-derived runtimes were compared with empirical runtimes from field tests on

304

noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula), where mobile nodes were either powered by a 12mAh

305

battery or a 22mAh battery, resulting in MN weights of 1.1g to 1.9g depending on housing.

306

The average runtime was 148h (max. 209h) for the small battery, while the model predicted

307

151h. For the larger battery, average runtime was 280h (max. 426h) with a predicted

308

average value of 277h. For both batteries, the predicted values were very close to the

309

observed (1.8% overestimation and 0.7% underestimation, respectively) indicating that the

310

model is a reliable tool for experimental design of a field study.

315

environments10 have previously pushed the boundaries of what was technologically feasible.

316

BATS takes the next step by combining these functionalities while keeping the tag weight at

317

one to two gram. Adhering to the 5% rule25, even animals weighing as little as 20g can be

318

tagged with this system. These smaller species make up a large proportion of birds and

319

mammals (see Figure 3 in1) and WBNs will give researchers new capabilities to address a

320

wide range of questions in animal behavior and ecology. Our adaptive and scalable system

321

design provides great flexibility to tailor such a system, allowing adjustable use for any

322

species- and study-specific requirement. The design of the mobile node allows to add

323

multiple functionalities beyond the ones presented here, such as accelerometers,

324

magnetometers, or even an on-board electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors26.

325

An early example of automated tracking of small-bodied animals on a limited

326

geographic scale was ARTS, a system for automated VHF tracking, which was installed on

327

Barro Colorado Island, Panama27. This six-year endeavor in the 2000s already highlighted

328

the promising opportunities offered by WBNs: scalability, remote reconfiguration, full

329

automation, and low-cost tags. Yet, a rather low positioning accuracy (~50 m) and restricted

330

coverage were limiting factors27. Most of today’s solutions for automated tracking of small

331

animals such as songbirds, bats, or rodents perform best at larger geographic scales or in

332

open habitats. For example, current versions of 1 g GPS loggers are suitable to explore

333

seasonal large-scale movements18, 20. However, they cannot reconstruct flight paths in a

334

complex environment, since they can only collect around 100 fixes. Furthermore, the

335

physical devices must be retrieved for data recovery, and satellite reception suffers within

336

vegetated areas. Alternatively, reverse GPS can track small animals much more energy-

337

efficiently and at much higher temporal and spatial resolution by measuring time-of-flight at

338

ground-based receiving stations10. However, time-of-flight measurements are inherently

339

affected by vegetation and perform best in open areas. Therefore, we combined signal

340

strength measurements (including angle of arrival (AoA) estimates) from two frequency

341

bands and probabilistic multipath mitigation28 to create a system that is robust to multipath

342

propagation and thus performs well in complex environments. Common but costly measures

343

to resolve multipath propagation are large-aperture antenna arrays for AoA tracking or large

344

signal bandwidth for time-of-flight tracking. However, the future of animal tracking will most

345

certainly center on low cost, ultra-low power integrated circuits, which are currently

346

experiencing a noticeable push due to their broad applications in Industry 4.0 and 5G. This

347

technology has the potential to dramatically boost the capabilities of biologging devices.

348

Contact networks of small-bodied animals have received increased attention in past

349

years and are most commonly built from RFID- (radio-frequency identification) or PIT-

350

(passive integrated transponder) tagged animals that were observed to be feeding or

351

sleeping at the same site at the same time29-31. Later developments for direct encounter

352

logging were able to log association independently of the locality. However, these sensors

353

were either quite large and heavy11 or had short runtimes of less than 24h32 due to the high

354

energy demand for the permanently active receiver — a major shortcoming for applications

355

in small-bodied species. We show that the use of wake-up receivers and adaptive operation

356

paired with novel wireless communication protocols dramatically reduce the energy demand

357

of such wireless sensor tags. We believe that direct encounter logging or more precisely

358

proximity sensing will enable diverse research in the future, as this approach creates large

359

datasets, with additional sensor data providing the behavioral context closing the gap

360

between social patterns and their underlying processes2.

361

Ongoing work on ultra-low power sensor networks not only targets animal tracking

362

systems but a variety of "Internet of Things"-solutions in general. Energy efficiency is not only

363

a question of hardware circuit design but also of how to interact across all relevant layers in

364

the node's software stack (i.e., application, and operating system). On the mobile node, the

365

interaction aspect between communication layers (e.g., application and MAC layer) concerns

366

the placement of certain functions (e.g., retransmissions) within the entire software

367

hierarchy33 such that energy-efficient operation is not affected by unnecessary functional

368

redundancies. Besides, cross-layer designs that optimize the timing of communication

369

processes and make them deterministic at least within limits34 form the software-engineering

370

basis for an overall energy-aware systems approach. In our scenario, energy-efficient and

371

reliable communication between nodes are cross-cutting concerns, since failed

372

communication attempts lead to additional overhead for retransmissions. Very promising

373

examples for low-power communication initiation are novel selective wake-up receivers35,

374

which allow the small tags to enter sleep modes in the nano-ampere range rather than

375

constantly operating in the micro- or milli-ampere range. Selective wake-up concepts allow

376

waking up dedicated recipients of a message (or a selected subset thereof) instead of

377

waking up all systems in communication range. Integrated into the animal tracking nodes,

378

this could enable the next quantum leap on low-power operation. The alternative to making

379

the receiver operate on a lower energy budget is to make the communication more reliable.

380

Recent advances in integrating coding for forward error correction into such lightweight

381

systems show very promising results, e.g., using erasure codes22. Ultra-reliable

382

communication protocols currently used in 5G networks can also be applied to localization

383

nodes, which are used for quasi-live tracking in the bat tracking scenario. For example, the

384

ground network can be used as a distributed antenna array, which allows the use of smart

385

decoding algorithms for very weak communication signals to further optimize data recovery36.

386
387

Conclusions

388

There is no single best method for tracking animal behavior. RFID- and PIT-tags allow

389

monitoring presence of animals at known sites at low cost. Satellite-based localization will

390

remain the method of choice to monitor large-scale movements such as migration or to

391

explore unpredictable events such as nomadism1, 37. However, we believe that WBNs like

392

BATS will greatly benefit biologging of small animal species that move over smaller and more

393

predictable spatial scales, especially inside of habitats where signal transmission is

394

constrained. The homologies of applications between mobile communications and biologging

395

(e.g., Bluetooth low energy for communication among mobile nodes12) will boost the

396

development of WBNs. Experimental setups including automated triggers (e.g., acoustic

397

playbacks or other sensory cues) might easily be integrated and direct proximity sensing will

398

bring exciting research opportunities. Such setups will allow to study the effect of social

4. Methods

403

The WBN hardware, software, and functionality:

404

Figure 1 is a schematic overview of BATS. In order to study its performance, we empirically

405

evaluated the three major functions of the system: proximity sensing (Figure 1a), high-

406

resolution tracking at local scales (Figure 1b), and long-range telemetry (Figure 1c). See

407

Glossary (Supplementary Table 1) for definitions of terms.

408
409

Proximity sensing:

410

Any given mobile node (MN) dyad generates meetings whenever it comes within reception

411

range (5 - 10 m depending on the environment). The animal-borne MN consists of a 22mm x

412

14mm Flex PCB circuit board, which is populated with a central System-on-Chip (EFR32,

413

Silicon Labs) containing an ARM Cortex-M4 core and two radio frontends for 868/915MHz

414

and 2.4GHz (Supplementary Figure 2). The transmitter in the sub-GHz frontend periodically

415

sends MN-beacons, a signal that contains a wake-up sequence. The rate of beacons is

416

configurable (see below). A low-power wake-up receiver on the MN triggers the conventional

417

receiver to receive incoming information on the ID whenever a MN-beacon is received from

418

another MN. Subsequently, a meeting is created between the communicating MN-dyad

419

(Figure 1a left). While a conventional receiver draws a relatively high current in receiving

420

mode waiting for incoming packages, a wake-up receiver achieves this functionality with a

421

low current (yet, at cost of sensitivity and performance). When no further MN-beacons are

422

received from the meeting partners for 5 MN-beacon intervals, the meeting is closed and

423

stored to memory along with the ID of the meeting partner, meeting duration, maximum RSSI

424

and a relative timestamp. The mobile node contains both persistent and volatile random-

425

access memory for data storage.

426

The conventional receiver of the sub-GHz frontend is periodically activated to observe

427

the presence of a ground node (at a fixed interval of every two seconds), which is indicated

428

by a ground node beacon (GN-beacon), periodically broadcast by the transmitter of each

429

ground node (Figure 1a right). The transmitter supports several configurations defining the

430

main purpose of the ground node (GN) and enabling location-dependent adaptive operation

431

of the WBN. (i) A download-dedicated GN broadcasts a signal that enables transmitting MN

432

data based on a customizable RSSI threshold received at the mobile node. (ii) A tracking-

433

dedicated ground node positioned within the grid of localization nodes for high-resolution

434

tracking broadcasts a signal that activates the 2.4GHz frontend in addition to the sub-GHz

435

front end on the MN, transmitting ‘localization packets’ at a rate of 8 packets per second. (iii)

436

A presence-detection-dedicated GN triggers the transmission of ‘presence signals’ by an MN

437

and stores incoming signals which can be used to determine presence/absence of tagged

438

individuals (presence at resources or at sleeping sites). Combinations of functionalities (i-iii)

439

may be used in a single GN if desired (e.g., a tracking-dedicated GN can also trigger data

440

download). Incoming MN data is received by the GN and stored by a Raspberry Pi

441

(Raspberry PI Foundation, Cambridge, UK) to a SD card along with the ID of the transmitting

442

MN and the receiving GN, respectively, and a timestamp, which is provided by a GPS unit.

443

The Raspberry Pi also hosts a WiFi allowing the user remote data access.

444

Visualization of proximity sensing data is facilitated by the custom-made software

445

‘meeting splitter’ (see Figure 2). For each specified mobile node ID, the current meeting

446

partners are projected onto a discrete time axis (one second resolution). We specified a

447

configurable time window around each point on the time axis (five seconds in case of Figure

448

2). All ongoing meetings, which overlap with the window around the respective point in time,

449

are included in the set of associated bats at this particular point in time. The result per bat is

450

a set of associated bats per each second in the dataset. A subsequent automated analysis

451

classifies each meeting as inside or outside the roost, depending on the number of

452

simultaneous meeting partners (not applied in this manuscript).

454

RSSI-based high-resolution tracking:

455

Localization nodes (LN) perform field strength measurements, which are collected by WLAN

456

and are processed by a PC including a file system whenever animal-borne mobile nodes

457

enter the localization grid (Figure 1b; localization nodes collect localization packets from

458

mobile nodes; the transmission is triggered by a ground node). Each localization node

459

comprises a software-defined radio (consisting of a radio-frequency frontend, a highly

460

integrated analog-to-digital converter, a field-programmable gate array and a microcontroller)

461

and two receiving antenna gain patterns each with two main lobes (Figure 1b, red and blue

462

pattern, respectively). The bi-lobed shape indicates the directional sensitivity of the antenna,

463

while the direction of each lobe represents its maximum in sensitivity. The red pattern is

464

rotated by 90° compared to the blue pattern, and both are simultaneously used to estimate

465

the angles of arrival (AoA) of the localization packages transmitted by the animal-borne MNs.

466

The difference in received signal strength (RSS) of the two patterns relates to AoA: If the

467

difference – RSS of the blue pattern minus RSS of the red pattern – is maximum, the wave

468

front impinges on the localization node either from east or west; if the RSS difference is

469

minimum, the direction of arrival is N or S. Accordingly, there are four options for the AoA if

470

the difference is zero: NE, NW, SE or SW. These ambiguities are resolved by fusing

471

measurements of several localization nodes.

472

This design allows us to exploit not only error-prone absolute field strength

473

measurements40, but also fail-safe angles of arrival. These are not affected by faulty

474

propagation laws or shadowing effects, because both error sources disappear when forming

475

the RSS differences. The angular resolution of the AoA estimates improves with increasing

476

ambiguity of the antenna pattern designs. However, more localization nodes have to be in

477

reach to resolve the ambiguity41. During the Forchheim field trial, we collected up to 272

478

angle estimates per second when all 17 localization nodes were in reception range.

479

To further improve localization accuracy, we exploited three sources of information

480

((a) model-based Bayesian positioning, (b) frequency diversity, (c) retrodiction), which

481

increase robustness against multipath propagation. This effect complicates the positioning

482

process, in particular in structurally complex environments since wave fronts impinge a

483

localization node out of the different directions of multiple reflectors (e.g., surrounding

484

vegetation). The information sources to counteract multipath-related adverse effects are

485

described in the following:

486

(a) Model-based Bayesian positioning: Due to the nature of multipath propagation, a

487

stochastic model can be devised to characterize the resulting spread in the AoA estimates28.

488

This AoA measurement model can be incorporated into the likelihood function of the

489

recursive Bayesian positioning process, e.g., based on a Kalman filter or a related grid-based

490

estimation filter42. The recursive estimation process yields a probability distribution

491

characterizing where the bat may be, considering propagation characteristics from a local

492

channel model43. All measurements are fused during the recursive process taking into

493

account a movement model reflecting the flight characteristics of a bat (e.g., max. flight

494

speed). The better the agreement of the various AoA estimates, the more pronounced the

495

positioning probability distribution.

496

(b) Frequency diversity: Multipath propagation leads to frequency-dependent fading.

497

We therefore measured field strength not only on the primary far-reaching carrier frequency

498

at 868 MHz, but also on a secondary carrier frequency at 2.4 GHz. On both carrier

499

frequencies, wave forms comprising several subcarriers are employed to enhance the field-

500

strength based AoA estimation process. Due to the large carrier frequency separation (>

501

1.4GHz), frequency-dependent fading effects are de-correlated even if multipath time-of-flight

502

differences are minor, i.e., in the range of a few meters, which corresponds to our accuracy

503

level.

504

(c) Retrodiction. If we do not have to estimate the position of a particular bat in real-

505

time, we can exploit all measurements of a bat to estimate a complete trajectory. Forward-

506

backward filtering enhances estimation quality considerably, yielding a positioning quality in

507

the range of 4 m (1 - σ). Performance limits of field-strength based positioning have been

508

discussed in depth41, 44.

510

We evaluated the trade-off between tracking grid density and localization quality for the

511

Forchheim setup, which comprised 17 localization nodes. In particular, we asked: how many

512

localization nodes are required to obtain localization quality comparable to heavy-duty GPS

513

tracking? We selected subsets of 6 to 16 out of the 17 localization nodes in order to observe

514

the decrease in positioning accuracy with decreasing grid density. Trajectories including

515

standard deviation were estimated for each subset of localization nodes. 17 configurations

516

were calculated for the grid consisting of 16 nodes (all possible subsets of the full grid) and

517

25 unique, randomly chosen subsets for all remaining grid configurations (6 to 15 nodes,

518

respectively) to obtain average errors for the given number of nodes (see Figure 4).

519
520

Long-range telemetry

521

Our long-range telemetry approach aimed at transmitting long-range bursts from mobile

522

nodes over distances of up to several kilometers – much longer distances than our

523

download-dedicated ground nodes would allow for – within the city of Berlin, under harsh

524

shadowing by obstacles (vegetation, buildings, etc.) or in presence of numerous interferes.

525

We periodically transmitted ‘long-range bursts’, i.e., relative timestamps in form of seconds

526

since mobile node start-up generated by a simple clock counter. These timestamps are

527

crucial for post-processing of meeting because they allow accounting for clock drift on the

528

mobile node. We embedded the long-range functionality into the existing modulation scheme

529

using a hybrid phase-alternating modulation on top of the pure amplitude-modulated wake-up

530

sequences of the MN-beacon45. As a consequence of the extreme energy limitation of the

531

MN, we ensured the required Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) by counterbalancing the rate and

532

the desired transmission distance. The combination of the hybrid modulation, the channel

533

encoding procedure17, 45 and the ‘Telegram-splitting’ technique16 enables an ultra-low power

534

long-range transmission without additional expenditure of energy. The long-range bursts

535

were received at two long-range receivers, which were deployed on exposed sites (rooftops)

536

at distances of ca. 200 - 1,800m (retirement home) and 3,300 - 4,500m (cogeneration plant;

537

see Figure S1) to the proximate respectively ultimate border of the urban forest where the

538

roosts of the tracked bats were located.

539

We quantified communication distances in the field, which was possible when a

540

tagged bat occupied a known roost and was simultaneously received by the long-range

541

receiver. We therefore matched timestamps of signals received simultaneously by GNs at

542

roosting sites and at long-range receivers. In case of a match, we quantified the distances

543

between roosts and long-range receivers in the R package geosphere using the Haversine

544

function46. The empirically assessed communication distances have then been compared to

545

a theoretical model of long-range transmission distances47. This model evaluates achievable

546

rate and distance of transmission based on the energy relation of the SNR, presuming the

547

transmission power given by the MN’s hardware configuration and a desired target payload

548

rate. For simulating the channel characteristics faced by the MN, the model comprises

549

parameters like the path loss in dependence of the signal-center frequency, the transmission

550

distance and receiver and transmitter heights. Environmental influences like attenuation by

551

obstacles, multi-path propagation or unpredictable rotation of the MN’s rod antenna are

552

incorporated by means of a random variable, stating the superimposed attenuation effects.

553

Based on these assumptions we were capable of overcoming path losses of over 150dB for

554

a distance of 5 km and more, under reasonable rates of packet loss17, thus accomplishing an

555

ultra-robust implementation supporting payload data rates of a few bits per second.

556
557

Sensor node energy consumption and runtime

558

A crucial aspect for biologging is knowledge on the runtime of the sensor nodes. Static

559

program-code analysis methods of the mobile node are able to determine upper bounds on

560

the nodes’ runtime48. However, in the context of the BATS tracking system, precise estimates

561

for the average uptimes of the system proved to be more beneficial for the empirical studies

562

than upper bounds for the lifetime. Consequently, we focused on an energy model to

563

determine the average runtime of the mobile nodes, which is strongly dependent on the tasks

564

executed by the software. Our models are based on measurements of each executed task in

23

565

combination with empirically determined activity parameter of each task. That way, we

566

ensure highest accuracy for our model. In our setting, seven different tasks are implemented:

567

(i) Standby, (ii) sending MN-beacons, (iii) receiving MN-beacons, (iv) observing ground node

568

availability, (v) transmitting data to a ground node, (vi) sending localization packets, and (vii)

569

sending presence signals (see Table S Glossary for definition of terms).

570
571

We determined the runtime by using the specific energy demand for a task and by translating

572

it to an average current draw. With the average current draw and a given battery capacity,

ŋDCDC represents the efficiency of the DCDC-converter, which is permanently active and

576

consumes energy. Determining ŋDCDC is impractical, because it highly depends on the

577

actual current drain of the application for the entire runtime. For this reason, we assume a

578

fixed efficiency of 0.95, which translates to only 95% of the battery capacity being available

579

for software tasks. This way, losses caused by the DCDC and parasitic discharges of the

580

battery are modeled in a coarse-grained manner.

581

The idle current during standby is given in a current draw, which does not require any

582

further calculations. The other tasks (e.g., observing GN availability, sending localization

583

packets) are executed in predefined cycle times (duty cycle). Based on the measured energy

584

demand and the duty cycle, we calculated an average current draw for each task. The

585

energy demand for each task was measured in the lab with an Agilent DC power analyzer

586

precise source meter. In the case of a localization packet, which is sent every 128ms, the

587

average current draw can be expressed as follows:

The average time spent inside the localization grid (Tlocalization) per day is strongly dependent

590

on the species-specific animal behavior and the experimental design. For the calculations

591

presented here, we set the daily localization period to 2 or 4 hours, respectively.

592

Observing a ground node in receiving range is carried out at a fixed duty cycle of 2

593

seconds. Here, the task is independent of the behavior of the tracked animal and the energy

594

demand is calculated as follows:

595

The transmission rate of MN-beacons and presence signals is adaptive based on the contact

596

to a ground node (i.e., a mobile node near a GN at a roost will decrease the duty cycle in

597

comparison to a MN on a foraging animal which is not in reception range of a GN). In turn,

598

the energy demand for sending beacons and presence signals highly depends on the

599

behavior of the tracked study species and the individual animal (e.g., time spent near GNs at

600

roosting sites). We therefore used empirical data obtained in the Berlin field test to inform our

601

energy model with realistic averaged parameter values for duty cycles of each task and the

602

amount of transmitted data. We quantified the average time-tagged bats spent in reception

603

range of a GN (inactive mode, decreased duty cycle) versus the time bats spent outside the

604

reception range of any GN (active mode, increased duty cycle). The common noctule bats in

605

the Berlin field test spent on average 47% of the observation time in the inactive mode and

606

the energy demand for transmitting beacons and presence signals calculates as follows:

Receiving a MN-beacon depends on the duty cycle at which beacons are transmitted and on

the number of mobile nodes in receiving range. During the Berlin field test, we calculated the

average number of 2.05 maximum parallel meetings.

For data download to a GN, we assumed static energy consumption (the energy demand for

614

sending a data packet highly depends on the size of the packet to be transmitted23. The

615

number of data packets to be transmitted is again dependent on the behavior of the tracked

616

animal (depending on how many meetings an individual accumulates). Mobile nodes on

617

common noctule bats sent on average 23.7 packages per hour to a ground node. Thus the

618

current draw can be denoted as:

619

Based on these calculations, we matched the estimated average runtimes to the observed

620

runtimes during the Berlin field test (based on the last beacon or packet received from each

621

individual tagged bat).

622
623

Adaptive operation, scalability, and reconfiguration:

624

The adaptive operation contributes to the energy efficiency of BATS. We define location-

625

specific communication schemes on the mobile nodes which are initiated by ground nodes.

626

At a noctule bat day roost, for example, GNs activated the inactive beacon interval where

627

MN-beacons for meeting generation were only sent every 10 seconds. When tagged bats

628

leave their roost and move beyond the reception range of the GN, the MN switches to the

629

active interval, sending a MN-beacon every two seconds, which increases the probability to

630

detect also very short meetings in comparison to the inactive rate. Similarly, localization

631

packets, which strongly increase the energy demand, should only be sent when the tagged

632

animal moves within the tracking grid and are therefore triggered by a GN within the grid.

633

BATS tracks multiple individuals simultaneously. Our current design allows for the

634

observation of up to a theoretical maximum of 60 individuals. Field deployments containing

635

11 to 50 tagged bats empirically validated this targeted scalability. The scale of the

636

localization grid can be adapted to the ranges required for experimental setups. While we

637

tracked mouse-eared bats on 1.5ha, smaller areas might be sufficient to track, e.g., rodents

638

(bank voles, which showed a density of 40 - 162 individuals per hectare, have been tracked

639

on less than 0.5ha using automated VHF telemetry49). Tracking grids larger than 1.5ha are

640

certainly possible from a technological point of view. Yet, one has to keep in mind that effort

641

for maintenance (e.g., replacing power sources for localization nodes) scales with the size of

642

the tracking grid.

643

Since settings for communication schemes are sometimes difficult to pick a priori, we

644

built an option for reconfiguration of so-called ‘soft-settings’ (active/inactive rate of MN-

645

beacons, RSSI-thresholds for data download, localization interval, or timeout duration after

646

which a running meeting is terminated, etc.). Four values for every soft-setting (e.g., active

647

rate 2s, 4s, 10s, 30s) can be defined a priori and during operation ground nodes can be used

648

to trigger a switch between these pre-defined values at the mobile node.

649
650

Field deployments:

651

BATS functions as a modular system and hardware setup and software configurations are

652

easily tailored to a specific use case. We evaluated BATS during three major field studies by

653

applying mobile nodes to vampire bats, noctule bats, and mouse-eared bats with body

654

weights of 27 - 48g, 18 - 35g, and 22 - 28g respectively. While at least two of the three major

655

functionalities (proximity sensing, high-resolution tracking, long-range telemetry) have been

656

used in all three field studies, we focus on one specific functionality per deployment.

657
658

Proximity sensing in vampire bats:

659

We tagged 50 common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus; 44 adult females, 6 subadults)

660

from a colony roosting in a cave tree near Tolé, Panama, to document social networks with

661

high resolution. Field work was conducted during September and October 2017. Mobile

662

nodes were powered by a 22mAh LiPo battery and housed in a 3D-printed plastic case,

663

resulting in a total weight of 1.8g. One download-dedicated ground node was positioned

664

inside the roost and five ground nodes were placed on surrounding cattle pastures to detect

665

the presence of foraging or commuting bats.

666
667

Long-range telemetry in noctule bats:

668

We captured and tagged 34 common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula; 19 adult females and

669

15 juveniles) from two bat boxes in a nursing colony an urban forest in the city of Berlin,

670

Germany (‘Königsheide Forst’)50. Mobile nodes were powered by either a 12mAh or a 22mAh

671

battery and were housed either in a 3D-printed plastic case or in a fingertip of a nitrile lab

672

glove that was sealed with glue. Total weight varied between 1.1 - 1.9g depending on

673

housing and battery. We positioned 5 ground nodes underneath known roosts to document

674

the presence of individual bats and to remotely download data. In addition, we set up two

675

long-range receivers to evaluate model-based predicted data retrieval over distances of up to

676

4-5km17. This opportunity is particularly valuable to retrieve data of tagged individuals that

677

moved to an unknown roost.

678
679

High-resolution tracking of mouse-eared bats

680

We captured 11 mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) using mist-nets set up at ground level in a

681

mature deciduous forest near Forchheim, Germany. When hunting for ground beetles,

682

mouse-eared bats are faithful to their foraging sites for consecutive days. We therefore mist-

683

netted bats at an attractive foraging site rather than catching them from a roost in order to

684

track repeated bouts by returning individuals over the course of several days. Mobile nodes

685

were powered by 22mAh batteries and housed in fingertips of nitrile lab gloves (total weight

686

1.4g). At the capture site we installed a tracking grid consisting of 17 localization nodes

687

covering roughly an area of 1.5ha (see Figure 3). Distance between tracking stations varied

688

between ca. 25 - 40m. The irregular configuration was due to the presence of thick trees. We

689

aimed at positioning tracking stations at least 3 - 5m away from trees to reduce shielding of

690

the signal. We set up a polygon-shaped reference path for estimating localization errors and

691

determined the true position of the corners using a Leica Robotic Total Station TS16

692

(positioning error < 5cm). Corners were connected using strings, and we walked either a

693

sensor node (once) or a GPS tracker (four times) (Ornitela OrniTrack-15; a 15g solar

694

powered GPS-GSM/GPRS tracker; maximum logging rate 1 fix per second at a lifetime of ca.

695

4h without solar harvesting) along the calibration path and calculated the average localization

696

error based on the obtained tracks.

Description

Hardware
Mobile node (MN)

Animal-borne sensor node.

Ground node (GN)

Multifunctional ground-based sensor nodes. Depending on the GNconfiguration, it receives data from MNs, triggers transmission of
localization packets at the MN, or triggers the transmission of presence
signals at the MN.

Localization node

Sensor node containing a dual-band antenna for high-resolution
positioning of MNs. Arranged in a tracking grid.

Long-range receiver

Long-range telemetry-dedicated sensor node for receiving long-range
bursts.

Communication and data types
Ground node beacon

A packet sent by a ground node that triggers action on the MN (e.g.,

(GN-beacon)

data download).

Mobile node beacon

A packet sent by a mobile node. It contains a wakeup sequence which

(MN-beacon)

wakes other MNs from standby.

Long-range burst

A packet embedded in the wakeup sequence of the MN-beacon for
data transmission to a long-range receiver.

Localization packet

A packet sent by a MN to localization nodes for high-resolution
tracking. Transmission is initiated by a GN-beacon.

Presence Signal

A packet sent by a MN to indicate the presence of a bat in range of a
GN. Transmission is initiated by a GN-beacon.

Software task on the mobile node
(i) standby

An idle state where only mandatory devices are active (e.g., wakeup
receiver). The idle state is terminated by the reception of a wakeup.

(ii) sending beacons

Sending a MN-beacon to wake nearby MNs from standby. Nearby MNs
immediately send their IDs in return.

(iii) receiving beacons

If the wakeup receiver receives a wakeup sequence, the conventional
receiver is activated to receive the IDs of nearby MNs (encoded in the
MN-beacons).

(iv) observing ground

Every 2 s the receiver is activated to check whether GN-beacons are

received.

(v) transmitting data to a
