ABSTRACT

19

Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) is a nontuberculous mycobacterium that causes

20

invasive pulmonary infections in patients with structural lung disease. Mab is intrinsically

21

resistant to several classes of antibiotics and an increasing number of strains isolated

22

from patients exhibit resistance to most antibiotics considered for treatment of Mab

23

infections. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new regimens with improved efficacy

24

to treat this disease. Synthesis of the essential cell wall peptidoglycan in Mab is

25

achieved via two enzyme classes, L,D- and D-D-transpeptidases, with each class

26

preferentially inhibited by different subclasses of β-lactam antibiotics. We hypothesized

27

that a combination of two β-lactams that comprehensively inhibit the two enzyme

28

classes will exhibit synergy in killing Mab. Paired combinations of antibiotics tested for in

29

vitro synergy against Mab included dual β-lactams, a β-lactam and a β-lactamase

30

inhibitor, and a β-lactam and a rifamycin. Of the initial 206 combinations screened, 24

31

pairs exhibited synergy. 13/24 pairs were combinations of two β-lactams. 12/24 pairs

32

brought the minimum inhibitory concentrations of both drugs to within the therapeutic

33

range. Additionally, synergistic drug pairs significantly reduced the frequency of

34

selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. These novel combinations of currently-

35

available antibiotics may offer viable immediate treatment options against highly-

36

resistant Mab infections.

INTRODUCTION

38

Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) is considered to be among the most virulent of the

39

rapidly-growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). It may be environmentally or

40

nosocomially acquired (1) and can lead to severe and invasive pulmonary infections in

41

immunocompromised patients or those with structural lung diseases, such as

42

bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis (CF). In the CF population, invasive Mab infections are

43

associated with rapid lung function decline (2-4), so adequate treatment of these

44

infections is paramount. Mab is intrinsically resistant to several classes of antibiotics

45

and the percentage of clinical isolates exhibiting resistance to the few drugs currently

46

available to treat this infection is steadily increasing (5-8). Sputum culture conversion

47

rates as low as 25% have been described with antibiotic treatment alone (9) and the

48

cure rate for Mab pulmonary disease is only 30-50% (10).

49
50

The current treatment guidelines for Mab pulmonary disease include at least 18 months

51

of multi-drug therapy, several of which require intravenous administration and may be

52

associated with significant cytotoxicity (11, 12). These recommendations are largely

53

based on empirical evidence, as few systematic clinical trials have been performed to

54

elucidate the optimal therapeutic regimen against Mab. It is also frequently necessary in

55

clinical practice to tailor treatment regimens based on the resistance profiles of

56

individual Mab isolates, as the high degree of variability in antibiotic resistance observed

57

among Mab strains often precludes use of a standardized regimen (10).

59

Macrolide antibiotics have historically been considered the backbone of treatment

60

against many NTMs, including Mab (2, 12). However, two of the three Mab subspecies,

61

abscessus and bolletii, harbor a functional erm(41) gene, which confers inducible

62

macrolide resistance and thus limits the effectiveness of this antibiotic class beyond the

63

first two weeks of treatment (13, 14). Guidelines therefore recommend subspeciation of

64

the Mab complex, which many clinical laboratories are not equipped to perform

65

routinely. Consequently, some CF centers prescribe initial treatment regimens that

66

include a combination of intravenous amikacin and either cefoxitin or imipenem rather

67

than a macrolide (15). Cefoxitin (a cephalosporin) and imipenem (a carbapenem) are

68

the only two β-lactam antibiotics included in the current Mab treatment guidelines (12,

69

16).

70
71

β-lactams function by inhibiting enzymes that catalyze synthesis of peptidoglycan, a

72

three-dimensional macromolecule that forms the exoskeleton of bacterial cells (17).

73

During the final step of peptidoglycan synthesis, Mab utilizes two enzyme classes; the

74

canonical D,D-transpeptidases (DDT, also known as penicillin binding proteins) and the

75

recently discovered L,D-transpeptidases (LDT) (18) to generate 4→3 and 3→3 linkages

76

between stem peptides, respectively (Figure 1). Since as many as 80% of the linkages

77

in Mab peptidoglycan are of the 3→3 type (18), the LDTs that generate them are likely

78

at least as important as DDTs for this organism. An initial survey of the Mab genome

79

identified five putative LDT encoding genes (19). These LDTs are differentially

80

susceptible to β-lactam subclasses, with most carbapenems exhibiting strong inhibitory

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/522649; this version posted January 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

81

activities, followed by cephalosporins, and only a select few penicillins exhibiting

82

moderate inhibition of these enzymes (20, 21).

83
84

Inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis is lethal to bacteria (22). As LDT and DDT activities

85

are required for synthesis of Mab peptidoglycan, simultaneous inhibition of both

86

enzymes could be bactericidal. Since these enzymes exhibit differential susceptibilities

87

to β-lactams (21, 23, 24), we hypothesize that a combination of β-lactam subclasses;

88

one that optimally inhibits LDTs and another that specifically targets DDTs, will

89

demonstrate synergy in killing Mab. In this study, we have tested this hypothesis by

90

assessing potencies of combinatorial pairs against Mab using a panel of 16 β-lactams

91

representing cephalosporins and carbapenems. Penicillins were not assessed, as many

92

require frequent dosing and we preferentially chose oral cephalosporins requiring daily

93

or twice daily dosing to simplify administration in patients.

94
95

Mab exhibits robust β-lactamase activity via BlaMab, which significantly reduces the

96

efficacy of β-lactams against this pathogen (25, 26). BlaMab degrades several β-lactams

97

with much greater efficiency than BlaC of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) (27). Among the known

98

β-lactamase inhibitors, avibactam strongly inhibits BlaMab (28) and reduces the MICs of

99

various β-lactams against Mab (25, 29-31). Although clavulanate, tazobactam, and

100

sulbactam are not potent inhibitors of BlaMab, (27) clavulanate is the only orally-

101

bioavailable agent and whether it exhibits synergy in combination with β-lactams against

102

Mab is not sufficiently documented. Therefore, we have included avibactam and

103

clavulanate in our study. Rifamycins were also included based on prior demonstration of

104

synergy between carbapenems and rifamycins against Mab in vitro (32-34).

105
106
107

RESULTS

108

MICs of β-lactams against M. abscessus

109

We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of several β-lactam antibiotics, including nine

110

cephalosporins (cefadroxil, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftibuten, cefdinir,

111

cefditoren, cefpodoxime, and cefoxitin), six carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem,

112

imipenem, doripenem, biapenem, and tebipenem), and a penem (faropenem) by

113

determining their Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) against Mab (Table 1). We

114

preferentially tested oral cephalosporins that did not require more than twice daily

115

dosing as their use in the clinical setting would be more convenient. MICs were also

116

determined for three rifamycin antibiotics (rifabutin, rifapentine, and rifampin) and two β-

117

lactamase inhibitors (clavulanate and avibactam), which were tested for synergy with β-

118

lactams in subsequent experiments. The majority of cephalosporins exhibited high

119

baseline MICs of 256 µg/mL, with the exception of cefoxitin and cefdinir at 64 µg/mL.

120

The MICs of the carbapenems/penem were more variable, ranging from 8 µg/mL for

121

imipenem to 256 µg/mL for ertapenem, tebipenem, and faropenem.

122
123

Several β-lactam combinations exhibit synergy against M. abscessus

124

A total of 206 paired combinations of antibiotics were initially screened for synergy via a

125

condensed version of the checkerboard assay, as described in materials and methods.

aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

126

Combinations included all possible pairs of cephalosporins and carbapenems/penem, a

127

rifamycin with either a cephalosporin or carbapenem/penem, and avibactam or

128

clavulanate with a cephalosporin or carbapenem/penem (Figure 2).

129
130

Of the initial 206 combinations screened, 60 combinations showed no growth at ¼ MIC

131

or less for each drug and were further evaluated to verify synergy and determine the

132

Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI), using a full checkerboard titration assay

133

as described in materials and methods (Figure 2). The FICI of a synergistic pair is a

134

mathematical representation of the degree to which each drug contributes to synergy

135

(35-37). Although substantial variability in the level of synergy among paired

136

combinations was observed, there were a few notable trends. For example, imipenem

137

was highly synergistic with all other drugs except clavulanate, and avibactam

138

demonstrated synergy with all β-lactams except ceftibuten. Of note, all of the

139

combinations that included clavulanate failed to inhibit growth of Mab in the presence of

140

antibiotics at concentrations as high as 2x MIC. This antagonism was unexpected, but

141

was reliably reproducible when the experiment was repeated.

142
143

A total of 24 out of the 60 combinations exhibited FICIs of ≤0.5 and thus were confirmed

144

as synergistic (Table 2). To determine if the degree of synergy between paired

145

combinations was sufficient to reduce MICs to within the therapeutic range, the

146

Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) of each drug in combination was used to

147

extrapolate expected MICs as a result of synergy. Although Clinical and Laboratory

148

Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines regarding MIC breakpoints against Mab are not

149

currently available for most of the antibiotics tested, they have been established for

150

cefoxitin and imipenem (38). Therefore, MIC breakpoints for all cephalosporins and

151

carbapenems/penem were assumed to be the same as those for cefoxitin (≤16 µg/mL,

152

susceptible; ≤64 µg/mL, intermediately susceptible) and imipenem (≤4 µg/mL,

153

susceptible; ≤8 µg/mL, intermediately susceptible), respectively. With regard to the

154

rifamycins, a breakpoint MIC of ≤1 µg/mL has been established for rifampin and

155

rifabutin against Mtb and Mycobacterium avium complex (38) and the same principle

156

was applied. Based on these presumed breakpoints, 5/24 combinations exhibited MICs

157

within the fully susceptible range for both drugs, and an additional 7/24 combinations

158

showed MICs that were considered moderately susceptible or intermediate. The

159

remaining 12/24 combinations were unable to bring MICs below resistance breakpoints.

160
161

All of the 12 most synergistic combinations—those that that brought MICs within the

162

therapeutic range—were pairs of either two β-lactams or a β-lactam and avibactam.

163

Several of the remaining 12/24 combinations also exhibited a high degree of synergy

164

based on FICI; however, their initial MICs were so high that the synergistic effect was

165

insufficient to reduce MICs to below presumed breakpoints. We also observed a limit to

166

the degree of synergy achievable with drugs exhibiting relatively low initial MICs, such

167

as imipenem, biapenem, and doripenem. Combinations with these drugs resulted in up

168

to a four-fold decrease in MIC, but this appeared to be the limit of reduction as MICs

169

approached 2 µg/mL.

171

Additionally, the rifamycins showed synergy in combination with two of the earlier

172

generation cephalosporins (cefprozil and cefadroxil); with at least a four-fold reduction in

173

MIC for each combination. However, given the relatively low presumed MIC breakpoint

174

of ≤ 1 µg/mL for rifamycins, none of the combinations brought MICs within the

175

therapeutic range.

176
177

β-lactam combinations reduce frequency of selection of spontaneous drug-

178

resistant mutants

179

The 24 synergistic combinations were also evaluated to determine the frequency at

180

which spontaneous resistant mutants are selected in the presence of paired drug

181

combinations compared to each drug alone (Table 3). The frequency of resistant

182

mutant selection was lower for all 24 combinations compared to the frequency for each

183

drug individually. The greatest decrease was noted among the cephalosporins at >4 log

184

reduction for six out of seven agents; with cefdinir being the exception, as the mutation

185

frequency of this drug alone was lower than that of the other cephalosporins. Also of

186

note, rifapentine and rifabutin exhibited the lowest frequency of resistant mutant

187

selection, with no mutant colonies observed on any of the individual drug plates.

188
189
190

DISCUSSION

191

Given the growing prevalence of extensively drug-resistant Mab infections, development

192

of novel treatment strategies is imperative. Although our current understanding of β-

193

lactam targets in Mab is not comprehensive, we have leveraged the available data to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/522649; this version posted January 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

194

begin developing synergistic treatment regimens with potential to treat Mab infections

195

that are resistant to standard therapies.

196
197

In this study, we tested a total of 206 paired combinations of antibiotics in vitro against

198

Mab reference strain ATCC 19977, 24 of which displayed synergy with FICI ≤ 0.5. Of

199

these, 12 combinations achieved MIC reductions below presumed breakpoints for both

200

drugs. Although a few studies have been published describing synergy between β-

201

lactams and other antibiotic classes against Mab in vitro (32, 34, 39, 40), only one has

202

assessed synergy between dual β-lactams (21). Our current study encompasses a

203

broader array of combinations and offers a more comprehensive analysis of the

204

synergistic activity of the two major β-lactam subclasses currently used to treat Mab

205

infections; cephalosporins and carbapenems.

206
207

We hypothesize that the basis for synergy exhibited by β-lactam pairs is their non-

208

redundant selective inhibition of distinct transpeptidases that synthesize PG in Mab. If

209

only one type of enzyme existed as the target for β-lactams, the pairs would likely

210

exhibit additive activity rather than synergy. Variation in the level of inhibition of L,D-

211

transpeptidases of Mab (21) and Mtb (20, 24, 41) by agents of this antibiotic class

212

supports this hypothesis. We further hypothesize that, at the molecular level, the

213

structures of β-lactams that exhibit synergy against Mab most effectively complement

214

the structure of the binding sites available in the transpeptidases of this organism;

215

thereby favoring initial binding and subsequent interaction to bring about effective

216

inhibition of the enzymes. Differences in binding affinity and kinetics of inhibition by

217

different β-lactams against LDTs of Enterococcus faecium (42) illustrate the basis for

218

this hypothesis.

219
220

Five out of 24 synergistic combinations included avibactam. In these combinations, the

221

MICs of three β-lactams (cefuroxime, imipenem, and biapenem) were reduced to below

222

therapeutic breakpoints. Therefore, avibactam appears to be a viable adjunct to β-

223

lactam-based treatment regimens. However, its current coformulation with ceftazidime

224

(which itself does not exhibit valuable activity against Mab (28, 30)) and intravenous

225

administration limit its usefulness. Relevant to the strategy of combining a carbapenem

226

with a β-lactamase inhibitor against Mab, several coformulated agents have recently

227

been developed. These include FDA-approved meropenem-vaborbactam (Melinta

228

Therapeutics) and imipenem-relebactam (Merck), which recently completed phase III

229

trials. Coformulations of cefepime-zidebactam (Wockhardt) and meropenem-

230

nacubactam (Roche) are currently in phase II of development. Although these

231

compounds have yet to be tested against Mab, our data suggest they could be viable

232

options for treatment of Mab infections and would potentially simplify β-lactam-based

233

regimens. Interestingly, clavulanate was found to be antagonistic in combination with all

234

β-lactams tested in this study, although the mechanism for this is unclear. As there is no

235

precedent for antagonism of β-lactam and clavulanate combinations against other

236

bacteria, we speculate the following hypotheses. Clavulanate is metabolized by Mab

237

and the resulting metabolite alters the rate of influx or efflux of β-lactams, thereby

238

reducing the effective concentration available to bind target enzymes. It is also possible

239

that binding of the clavulanate metabolite to target enzymes may alter their binding

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/522649; this version posted January 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

240

kinetics to β-lactams. In addition, the possibility of the clavulanate metabolite directly

241

competing for binding sites associated with the 4-carbon core ring of β-lactams cannot

242

be ruled out. Further study would be necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanism

243

for this phenomenon, including possibilities not considered above.

244
245

Another measure of synergy is the frequency of selection of spontaneous resistant

246

mutants. For a synergistic pair, the frequency of resistant mutant selection would ideally

247

be lower than the product of frequencies associated with either drug alone. The majority

248

of drug pairs with the lowest FICIs selected resistant mutants with a frequency of <1 x

249

10-10, which approaches the product of the individual drugs (Table 3). However, due to

250

physical limitations of the number of Mab CFU that could be used to identify resistant

251

mutants, we were unable to obtain the exact frequency of mutant selection for several

252

paired combinations. Based on these observations, we propose that the majority of

253

pairs identified here exhibit synergy in both antimicrobial activity and reduction of

254

selection of drug-resistant mutants.

255
256

Although significant variability in MIC exists among Mab strains and in vitro drug

257

susceptibility data does not always correlate with clinical efficacy (43), the novel β-

258

lactam combinations identified here using the reference Mab strain ATCC 19977 could

259

be leveraged for further preclinical assessment, including in vivo efficacy against drug-

260

resistant clinical isolates. As Mab treatment generally necessitates a regimen consisting

261

of at least 3-4 agents, the addition of other antibiotic classes or β-lactamase inhibitors to

262

these synergistic β-lactam combinations may further potentiate MIC reduction and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/522649; this version posted January 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

263

improve efficacy. This may also allow clinicians to avoid use of the more cytotoxic

264

antibiotics such as amikacin, especially in the context of prior adverse effects.

265
266

Based on current trends of Mab strains isolated in clinics, resistance to an increasing

267

number of drugs is likely to continue over the next several years; further compromising

268

our ability to treat disease resulting from this pathogen. New antibiotics and

269

coformulations are currently in development, but none are primarily intended for

270

treatment of Mab or other NTM infections and it could take several years for efficacy

271

studies to be completed. Repurposing of currently-available antibiotics in novel

272

combinations, such as those identified here, may provide vital immediate therapeutic

273

options for patients failing standard Mab treatment regimens and facilitate rapid

274

implementation in the clinical setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

278
279

Bacterial strains and in vitro growth conditions

280

The Mab reference strain ATCC 19977 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was used for all

281

experiments. Strains were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with

282

0.5% glycerol, 10% albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment, and 0.05% Tween80, at

283

37°C with constant shaking at 220 RPM in an orbital shaker. All drugs were obtained

284

from the following commercial vendors: ertapenem (Toronto Research Chemicals),

285

rifampin, meropenem, imipenem, doripenem, biapenem, faropenem, tebipenem, and all

286

cephalosporins (Sigma-Aldrich). To assess the quality of these compounds, a few were

287

randomly selected and assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The

288

purity of compounds ranged from 95% to 99%.

289
290

Minimum Inhibitory Concentration

291

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each drug against Mab was determined using

292

the standard broth dilution method (44, 45) in accordance with CLSI guidelines specific

293

for this organism (38). In summary, powdered drug stocks were reconstituted in

294

dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and two-fold serial dilutions were prepared in Middlebrook

295

7H9 broth to obtain final drug concentrations ranging from 256 µg/mL to 1 µg/mL in 96-

296

well plates in a final volume of 200 µL. 105 colony forming units (CFU) of Mab from

297

exponentially growing culture was added to each well. Mab culture without drug and

298

7H9 broth alone were included in each plate as positive and negative controls,

299

respectively. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 72 hours per CLSI guidelines. MIC was

300

assessed via visual inspection to determine growth or lack thereof and an MIC for each

301

drug was recorded as the lowest concentration at which Mab growth was not observed.

302

All MIC assessments were repeated to verify results.

304

Checkerboard Titration Assay

305

The checkerboard titration assay is a modiﬁed broth dilution assay and was performed

306

as previously described (35-37). An initial synergy screen of two-drug combinations was

307

performed at four different concentrations based on each drugs’ respective MIC: 2x

308

MIC, MIC, ½ MIC, and ¼ MIC for each drug in combination via two-fold serial dilutions

in a 96-well plate. 105 CFU of Mab from exponentially growing culture were inoculated

310

into each well, with positive and negative controls as described above for the MIC

311

assay, and plates were incubated at 30°C for 72 hours. Plates were visually inspected

312

for Mab growth or lack thereof. Drug combinations that inhibited Mab growth at ¼ MIC

313

or less of each drug were considered to have some degree of synergy and were chosen

314

for additional synergy testing.

315
316

To confirm the degree of synergy, two drugs were added to Middlebrook 7H9 broth in a

317

96-well plate, each starting at 2x MIC and serially diluted two-fold up to 1/32x MIC, so

318

all possible two-fold dilution combinations from 2x to 1/32x MIC were assayed. 105 CFU

319

of Mab were inoculated into each well. Plates were incubated at 30°C and evaluated for

320

Mab growth by visual inspection at 72 hours. The Fractional Inhibitory Concentration

321

(FIC) of each drug in combination was determined as described previously (35-37). The

322

FIC of a drug in a sample is calculated as the concentration of the drug divided by the

323

MIC of the drug when used alone. The FIC Index (FICI) is the sum of the FIC of two

324

drugs in a sample. The FICI was calculated for each combination of drugs that inhibited

325

Mab growth at less than ½ the MIC of each individual drug. An FICI of ≤0.5 was

326

interpreted as synergy, >0.5 to 2 as indifference, and >2 as antagonism. As an internal

327

control, the MIC of each individual drug was also assessed via broth microdilution within

328

each plate. All combinations with an FICI of ≤0.5 were tested in triplicate to confirm

329

reproducibility and an average FICI was calculated and reported here.

Determination of frequency of spontaneous drug resistance emergence

332

Any drug combination with an FICI of ≤0.5 was further assessed for frequency of

333

spontaneous drug resistance. The CFU/mL of Mab in culture at an A600nm of 1.0 was

334

initially determined as follows. Mab was grown to exponential phase, adjusted to an

335

A600nm of 1.0 in Middlebrook 7H9 broth and was serially diluted 10-fold in this broth. 100

336

µL of each dilution was plated onto Middlebrook 7H10 agar, which were incubated at

337

37°C for 72 hours. Resultant CFU counts were used to determine Mab CFU density in

338

culture. This assessment was repeated three times and the mean Mab CFU density

339

was used in calculations in subsequent experiments.

340
341

To determine frequency of spontaneous drug resistance emergence, 10 mL of Mab

342

culture grown to exponential phase in 7H9 broth was used to prepare a suspension at

343

A600nm of 1.0, and 1.0 mL of this suspension was inoculated onto each of 10 total

344

Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates, which were supplemented with either a single drug or a

345

combination of two drugs. These assessments were performed at the MIC for single-

346

drug and combination plates, to promote selection of resistant mutants. CFU were

347

counted after 7 days of incubation at 37°C. The frequency of drug-resistant mutants was

348

determined from the number of spontaneous mutants observed as a percentage of the

349

input CFU inoculum.
