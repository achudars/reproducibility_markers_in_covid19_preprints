Abstract
The radical SAM enzyme viperin exerts a wide range of antiviral effects through both the synthesis of
the antiviral nucleotide 3’-deoxy-3’, 4’-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) and through its interactions with
various cellular and viral proteins. Here we investigate the interaction of viperin with hepatitis C
virus non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) and the host sterol regulatory protein, vesicle-associated
membrane protein A (VAP-33). NS5A and VAP-33 form part of the viral replication complex that is
essential for copying the RNA genome of the virus. Using transfected enzymes in HEK293T cells, we
show that viperin binds to both NS5A and VAP-33 independently and that this interaction is
dependent on all three proteins being localized to the ER membrane. Co-expression of viperin with
VAP-33 and NS5A was found to reduce NS5A levels, most likely by increasing the rate of proteasomal
degradation. However, co-expression of viperin with VAP-33 and NS5A also reduces the specific
activity of viperin by ~ 3-fold. This observation suggests that NS5A may have evolved to bind viperin
as a strategy to reduce ddhCTP synthesis, thereby reducing possibility of the replication complex
introducing this chain-terminating nucleotide during genome synthesis.

Introduction
Viral infection of eukaryotic cells initiates a number of viral recognition strategies aimed at preventing
the spread of infection. Induction of antiviral cytokine interferons (IFN) is one of the primary innate
immune defences against viruses. Type I IFN induces the expression of numerous interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) that limit viral replication. Viperin (Virus inhibitory protein, Endoplasmic
Reticulum-associated, Interferon-inducible) is one of the ISGs that have been implicated directly as
having antiviral activity. Viperin appears to exert antiviral activity against a wide range of viruses by
and has been show to interact with various cellular and viral proteins. Especially, it has been shown to
inhibit several flaviviridae family viruses; including Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) (1-3), dengue virus
(DENV)(4,5), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)(6-8), West Nile virus (WNV)(4), and Zika virus
(ZIKV)(8-11).
The molecular basis of viperin’s inhibitory effects seems to be virus-specific. For HCV and DENV, it was
shown to inhibit viral replication by interacting with the non-structural proteins(1,5,11,12), while for
TBEV, it impedes the synthesis of positive-strand viral RNA(7). A recent study revealed that viperin can
also inhibit ZIKV and TBEV replication by interacting with both structural and non-structural viral
proteins(8). The regulation of viral proteins by viperin unveils the mechanistic insights of its antiviral
activity. However, the underlying unifying mechanism by which viperin targets a broad range of viruses
is still under investigation.
Viperin is a radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent enzyme (13-15), a superfamily of
enzymes that catalyses a wide range of reactions involving free radical intermediates. Of the more
than 110,000 radical SAM enzymes, viperin is one of only eight found in humans (16). The superfamily
is characterized structurally by a partial (βα)6 barrel fold with a CxxxCxxC motif [Figure 1(a)]; the
cysteinyl residues of which chelate the iron-sulfur [Fe4S4] cluster that is essential for radical
generation. A 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical (5'-dAdo·) is generated from SAM by 1-electron reduction
mediated by the iron-sulfur cluster. The adenosyl radical then abstracts a hydrogen atom from the
substrate to form 5’-deoxyadenosine (5’-dAdo) as a by-product [Figure 1(c)]. In subsequent steps, the
substrate-radical intermediate can undergo a diverse array of chemical transformations, depending
upon the enzyme (17-19).
The enzymatic activity of viperin was only recently elucidated; it was shown to catalyse the formation
of a novel antiviral ribonucleotide by dehydration of CTP to 3’-deoxy-3’, 4’-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP)
[Figure 1(d)]. ddhCTP acts as a chain terminator for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) in
flaviviruses, thereby explaining one facet of viperin's antiviral activity (20). However, ddhCTP did not
seem to be effective in restricting RdRps from other human viral families. Moreover, viperin’s catalytic
activity does not explain viperin's ability to regulate different metabolic pathways through its
interactions with different cellular and viral proteins. For example, viperin was recently shown to
modulate immune signalling through the Toll-like receptor-7 and -9 pathways by interactions with
interleukin-1 receptor– associated kinase-1 (IRAK1) and E3 ubiquitin ligase TNF receptor–associated
factor 6 (TRAF6) (21).
In this study we focus on viperin’s interaction with the Hepatitis C non-structural protein 5A (NS5A),
which is an essential component of the viral replication complex (1,3). NS5A localizes at the
cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets together with the RdRp, NS5B.

Interaction of NS5A with the sterol regulatory host protein, vesicle-associated membrane protein A
(VAP-33), is also needed to support HCV replication (12,22). Through FRET analysis (3), confocal
microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation studies (1), viperin was shown to interact with NS5A through
VAP-33 at lipid droplets. This observation suggests that the interaction between viperin and VAP-33
may interfere with the association of NS5A and VAP-33, thereby perturbing the viral replication
complex formation [Figure 1(b)]. Mutagenic analysis showed that the C-terminal domain of viperin is
required for its interaction with NS5A through VAP-33 in HEK293T cells.
Here we have investigated the interactions between viperin, NS5A and VAP-33 and their effect of
virperin’s catalytic activity using proteins transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and with pure
proteins in vitro. We show that full-length viperin interacts with NS5A in presence of host cell factor
VAP-33 and leads to its degradation through the proteasomal degradation pathway. Concomitantly,
NS5A and VAP-33 reduce the ddhCTP-forming activity of viperin. The formation of the complex
between viperin, NS5A and VAP-33 is dependent on the membrane localization of all three proteins.
The present study provides insight into the mechanism of regulation of a viral protein by viperin,
coupled with its enzymatic activity.

Results
Viperin interacts with NS5A at endoplasmic reticulum
We first examined the interaction of viperin with NS5A and the c-terminal cytoplasmic domain of VAP33 (hVAPc; human homolog with amino acid residues 156-242), which previous studies (1) had shown
is responsible for binding to NS5A. We conducted immunoprecipitation experiments using viperin or
viperinΔ3C (viperin variant with iron-sulfur cluster-chelating cysteine residues mutated to alanine) as
bait proteins and NS5A and/or hVAPc as prey proteins.
NS5A was found to co-precipitate with viperin [Figure 2(a)], independent of the presence of hVAPc.
NS5A was also co-precipitated by the viperinΔ3C mutant [Figure 2(a)], suggesting that the presence
of the iron-sulfur cluster is not an essential part of the viperin-NS5A interaction. Both viperin and
viperinΔ3C mutant were found to precipitate hVAPc individually. We further confirmed the colocalization of viperin, NS5A and hVAPc by immuno-fluorescence microscopy of fixed HEK293T cells,
where NS5A was observed to co-localize with viperin at endoplasmic reticulum in the presence and
absence of hVAPc [Figure SI.1]
We also assessed the importance of the N-terminal amphipathic helix of viperin for its interaction with
NS5A and hVAPc by co-immunoprecipitation using an N-terminal truncated viperin construct (viperinΔN50) that lacks the ER localizing amphipathic helix as the bait protein. In this case NS5A and hVAPc
showed a weaker interaction with viperin-ΔN50 [Figure 2(b)], indicating that the localization of viperin
to the endoplasmic-reticulum is important for its interaction with the target proteins.
Viperin leads to the degradation of NS5A through proteasomal degradation pathway
Viperin has been found to alter the cellular expression levels of various proteins it interacts with(8,23).
Therefore, we next examined how co-expression of viperin altered the cellular levels of NS5A and
hVAPc. Proteins were co-transfected into HEK293T cells and after 30 h the cells were harvested and

protein expression analysed by immunoblotting. Co-expression with hVAPc had no significant effect
on NS5A expression, whereas co-expression with viperin resulted in a small decrease in NS5A levels.
Co-expression of both hVAPc and viperin led to the most significant decrease in intra-cellular
expression level of NS5A, by ~2-fold, compared to NS5A expressed on its own [Figure 3(a)]. No
reduction of NS5A levels were observed in control experiments when empty vector (pcDNA3.1) was
co-transfected with it. Similar reductions in NS5A levels were observed when NS5A was co-expressed
with viperinΔ3C and hVAPc, suggesting the iron-sulfur centre is not required for this effect.
To investigate the reason for the viperin-mediated reduction in NS5A expression, we examined the
ability of the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 to restore NS5A expression levels. The expression levels
of NS5A co-expressed with viperin or viperinΔ3C were restored to levels comparable to those of the
controls by treatment with MG-132 [Figure 3(b)]. These results suggest that viperin promotes the
degradation of NS5A through the proteosomal degradation pathway.
NS5A and hVAPc together repress the reductive SAM cleavage activity of viperin
NS5A is known to antagonize the innate immune system by inactivating various ISGs (24). For example,
NS5A was shown to disrupt dimerization and repress the enzymatic activity of Protein kinase R, a
critical ISG in cellular antiviral response (25). Therefore, we investigated whether NS5A might alter
the catalytic activity of viperin. To examine this possibility, we measured specific activity of viperin in
HEK293T cell lysates when co-expressed with NS5A and/or hVAPc. HEK293T cell-lysates were prepared
under anaerobic conditions and viperin activity was quantified as described previously (21).
When expressed on its own, viperin showed a specific activity, expressed as a turnover number, kobs =
7.6 ± 0.6 h-1. When co-expressed with hVAPc, this activity increased slightly with kobs = 13.1 ± 1.1 h-1,
whereas co-expression with NS5A did not change the specific activity of viperin, kobs = 8.4 ± 0.7 h-1.
However, when viperin was co-expressed with both hVAPc and NS5A, the specific activity of viperin
was significantly lowered to kobs = 4.0 ±0.4 h-1. [Figure 4, Figure SI.3]. VAP-33 is a known interaction
partner of viperin, therefore, it was not unexpected to see the increase in activity of viperin (about
~1.7- fold relative to single-expressed viperin) in its presence. However, a ~3.3-fold reduction in
relative activity of viperin upon addition of NS5A (comparing viperin with hVAPc alone and with both
proteins) is quite remarkable; as this deactivation of radical SAM activity of viperin has not been
previously observed.
The membrane-localizing domains of viperin, NS5A and VAP-33 are required for complex formation
To examine the changes in enzymatic activity in more detail we attempted to reconstitute the
interactions between viperin, NS5A and hVAPc using purified proteins obtained by over-expression in
E. Coli. However, this necessitated removing the membrane-binding domains of these proteins so
that they could be produced in soluble form. A C-terminal His6-tagged viperin lacking the first 50
membrane-associated amino acids (viperin-ΔN50), was purified under anaerobic conditions and the
iron-sulfur cluster was reconstituted using procedures as described previously (15). NS5A lacking the
first 39 amino acids comprising the membrane-binding amphipathic helix (NS5A-ΔN39), was expressed
and purified as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (MBP), followed by TEV cleavage and
size exclusion chromatography as described in the methods section. The N-terminal His6-tagged VAP33 construct lacking the last 20 amino acids of the trans-membrane domain on the C-terminus (VAP33-ΔC20), was purchased commercially.

However, when the interactions between these three proteins we examined by immunoprecipitation
using an anti-viperin antibody, no protein complexes could be detected [Figure 5]. Further
experiments designed to detect the formation of protein complexes using the lysine-reactive covalent
cross-linking reagent, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3), similarly failed to detect any inter-protein
crosslinking. Consistent with this, the catalytic activity of viperin-ΔN50 was unaffected by the
presence of NS5A-Δ39, or VAP-33-ΔC20. Under the conditions of the assay, kobs for viperin-ΔN50 was
4.1 ± 0.3 h-1, with the lower activity observed for the truncated construct being consistent with
previous observations (21). When mixed with stoichiometric amounts of NS5A-ΔN39 or VAP-33-ΔC20,
we measured rates of 2.7 ± 0.2 h-1 and 2.8 ± 0.1 h-1 respectively. Finally, combining all three proteins
yielded a comparable result with kobs = 2.8 ± 0.1 h-1 [Figure 6]. These results suggest that removing the
membrane-associated domains from these proteins effectively abolishes the ability of the proteins to
form a complex.

Discussion
To date, most of the studies conducted on the antiviral activity of viperin against flaviviridae viruses
have been focused on identifying physical interactions between viperin and viral core and nonstructural proteins and correlating perturbations of these interactions with changes in viral replication
or infectivity. Though the importance of domain-specific interactions between viperin and its target
viral proteins has been shown through mutational analysis, no investigation of the effects of these
interactions on the recently-revealed catalytic activity of viperin have been undertaken. The discovery
that viperin catalyzes the formation of the antiviral nucleotide ddhCTP from CTP raises the question
of whether the activity of viperin is modulated by the numerous proteins it has been shown to interact
with. Understanding the mechanism by which the synthesis of ddhCTP is viperin regulated by other
proteins may open the way to the design of new antiviral therapeutics.
Non-structural protein NS5A from HCV is one of the viral proteins that interacts with viperin. NS5A
interacts with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5B, within the replication complex and is
essential for genome replication (26,27). The reported interaction of NS5A and viperin could either
be a mechanism by which viperin inhibits viral replication, or an adaptation of the virus to inhibit
viperin. To investigate these possibilities we have examined the enzymatic activity of viperin in
complex with NS5A and the cellular protein VAP-33, which is co-opted as part of the viral replication
complex.
By reconstituting the complex between viperin, NS5A and VAP-33 in HEK293T cells, we were able to
investigate how NS5A and VAP-33 alter viperin’s catalytic activity. The most significant difference in
viperin activity was apparent when comparing the complex of viperin and VAP-33 and the complex of
viperin, VAP-33 and NS5A, with the addition of NS5A reducing the activity of viperin by ~ 3 fold. This
suggests that NS5A may have evolved, in part, to counteract the synthesis ddhCTP, thereby
potentiating the infectivity HCV. The localization of these proteins to the ER membrane or lipid
droplets appears to be crucial for the complex to form. This was evident from our in vitro studies using
purified proteins, which necessitated the removal of the membrane associated domains from the
proteins to facilitate their expression and purification. The truncated proteins failed to associate with

each other as evident from in vitro co-immunoprecipitation and chemical crosslinking experiments.
This observation is in agreement with previous studies on swine fever virus in which the N-terminal
domain of viperin was shown to be crucial to co-localize with the replication complex at lipid droplets
in HCV and interact with NS5A (28).
Although NS5A appears to inhibit viperin, our studies find support for the hypothesis that viperin
exerts an antiviral effect by promoting the degradation of NS5A through the proteasomal degradation
pathway. This presumably occurs by ubiquitination of NS5A. In this respect we note that viperin has
been shown to activate the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 in the context of innate immune signalling. It
seems plausible that viperin could act to recruit other E3 ligases that function in the endoplasmic
reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. Notably, this function of viperin does not
appear to require the iron-sulfur cluster, as the viperinD3C variant was equally effective in reducing
the cellular levels of NS5A. These findings are in accord with other studies showing that viperin
promotes the degradation of non-structural protein NS3 in other flaviviruses through the proteasomal
degradation pathway (8).
In conclusion, we find opposing effects on viral replication for the interaction between viperin and
HCV NS5A [Figure 7]. On one hand, NS5A appears to inhibit the activity of viperin, thereby reducing
the potential for ddhCTP to interfere with replication of the viral genome. On the other hand, viperin
appears to decrease the expression of NS5A to limit the formation of the replication complex. These
studies point to complex interplay between viral proteins and cellular proteins they co-opt for their
replication.

2-mercaptoethanol. The total amount of protein in lysates was determined by DC™ Protein Assay
(5000116, Biorad). The supernatants were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF
membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBST buffer (20 mM Tris, pH
7.5, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by overnight
incubation at 4°C in TBST buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk and the appropriate primary antibody.

Reductive SAM assay of viperin HEK293T cells transfected with viperin, and/or NS5A and hVAPc were
harvested from one 100-mm diameter tissue culture plate each, re-suspended in 500 µl of anoxic Trisbuffered saline (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, sonicated within an
anaerobic glovebox (Coy Chamber), and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min. Dithiothreitol (DTT; 5 mM)
and dithionite (5 mM) were added to the cell lysate together with CTP (300 μM). The assay mixture
was incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to starting the reaction by the addition of SAM
(200 µM). The assay was incubated for 60 min at room temperature, after which the reaction stopped
by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. The solution was chilled to 4 °C, and the precipitated proteins were
removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 25 min. The supernatant was then extracted with
acetonitrile. Samples were analysed in triplicate by UPLC-tandem mass spectrometry(29).
NS5A-ΔN39 in vitro expression and purification MBP_NS5A-ΔN39 was transformed into BL21(DE3)
chemically competent cells and plated on ampicillin (AMP) supplemented LB-agar plates. The
following day, a single colony was picked and added to 2-25mL fractions of AMP-supplemented LB
media and shaken overnight at 37°C. The seed cultures were added to 2L of 2xYT media supplemented
with AMP and 1% glycerol. The culture was shaken for approximately 3 hours, until mid-log was
achieved (O.D.600 ≈ 0.8), then cold shocked by incubation at 4°C for one hour. 0.5 mM IPTG was added
and the culture was grown at 16°C overnight. The cells were centrifuged and the pellet was harvested
and stored at -80°C.
The cell pellet was re-suspended at a ratio of 30 mL/ 2L culture in NS5A lysis buffer (30)(50 mM Tris
pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol, 2 mM L-Cysteine – HCl, 2 mM 2mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 1 cOmpleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet. The
cell suspension was lysed on ice via sonication at amplitude 8 in 20 second intervals for a total process
time of 4 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged for 45 min at 12,000 RPM. 1 mL of 100% Ni-NTA resin
(pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer) was added to the supernatant and incubated at 4°C for 2 hr. The
mixture was added to a 20 mL fritted column and the flow-through was collected and set aside. The
column was washed with 30 column volumes of lysis buffer supplemented with 25 mM imidazole. The
protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA using three - 10 column volume washes of lysis buffer
supplemented with 100, 200, or 300 mM imidazole. The lysate, pellet, supernatant, flow through,
wash, and all elutions were analysed via reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
NS5A-ΔN39 TEV cleavage and size exclusion chromatography Once presence and purity of the
protein was confirmed, the appropriate elution fraction was subjected to TEV cleavage. The reaction
contained approximately 10-15 mg of pure MBP_NS5A-ΔN39, 50 μg TEV, and 3 mM DTT, was carried
out overnight (18-20 hours) at 4°C, and the cleaved protein was purified over a pre-packed 5 mL MBPtrap column (from GE). The reaction was circulated over the column via peristaltic pump at 0.5 mL/min
three times and the flow through, which contained cleaved NS5A, was collected after a fourth pass.
The column was washed with 10 column volumes of NS5A storage buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl, 10% glycerol). Any un-cleaved protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of NS5A storage buffer
supplemented with 10 mM maltose.
Next, a size exclusion step was added in order to remove any soluble aggregate and additional protein
contaminants not removed by the post-TEV cleavage purification. Cleaved NS5A-ΔN39 was
concentrated down to approximately 3 mL and injected onto a pre-equilibrated prep-grade Superdex200 size exclusion column. The column was washed with NS5A storage buffer without glycerol at 1

mL/min. Elution fractions were compared against a 15-600 kDa protein standard (Millipore Sigma) and
analysed via SDS-PAGE for purity and presence of soluble, cleaved NS5A-ΔN39. These fractions were
concentrated and buffer exchanged using a PD-10 desalting column into NS5A storage buffer. This was
concentrated further to 500 μL (final concentration ~ 38 μM), aliquoted, and flash frozen for future
use. Protein concentration was estimated via Abs280 and confirmed with gel quantification.
Viperin-ΔN50 in vitro expression and purification Viperin-ΔN50 was expressed in the same manner
as described above with small differences. pRSFDuet-1 is kanamycin (KAN) resistant, so all antibiotic
selection steps were done with KAN. Once the culture entered mid-log phase, it was equilibrated to
18°C after which 0.2 mM Na2S · 9H20 was added. After 20 additional minutes of equilibration, 0.2 mM
FeCl3 and 0.1 mM IPTG were added and the culture was shaken overnight at 16°C. Cells were harvested
by centrifugation the following day and stored at -80°C.
The purification was carried out in the same manner as above, with small differences. All purification
steps were done in an anaerobic environment (Coy chamber) using anoxic (nitrogen flushed) buffers
(viperin-ΔN50 lysis buffer contained 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol). Once the
lysate had been cleared via centrifugation it was added to a pre-packed 5 mL His-Trap column (from
GE) via peristaltic pump. The solution was flowed over the column 3x at 0.5 mL/min and the flow
through was collected on the fourth pass. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of viperinΔN50 lysis buffer supplemented with 50mM imidazole. viperin-ΔN50 was eluted with three 15 mL
washes of lysis buffer supplemented with 200 mM imidazole. Protein presence and purity was
analysed in the same manner as above. Once confirmed, the appropriate elution fraction was
concentrated, buffer exchanged into viperin storage buffer (50mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol) with a PD-10 desalting column, and stored on ice before reconstitution.
Reconstitution of viperin-ΔN50 Fe4S4 cluster The reconstitution of the Fe4S4 cluster in the purified
viperin-ΔN50 was performed in an anaerobic environment (Coy chamber, O2 levels kept below 20
ppm)(15). Purified protein was incubated with 5 mM DTT for 20 min on cold beads. The stock solution
of 0.1 M FeCl3 and 0.1 M Na2S was added drop-wise, incubating for 10 min after each addition until
the protein turned dark brown in color. A 10 mL PD-10 desalting column was equilibrated with 2
column volumes of viperin storage buffer. The reconstituted protein (2.5 mL) was then added to the
equilibrated PD-10 column and eluted with 3.5 mL of viperin storage buffer. The elution was then
concentrated again using vivapore concentrators to the final volume of 1 mL. The concentrated
protein (final concentration~ 68 μM) was aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80°C.
Co-immunoprecipitation of recombinant NS5A and VAP-33 using recombinant viperin All steps were
performed inside anaerobic Coy chamber. Recombinant human viperin-ΔN50, purified from BL21
(DE3) E. Coli, was incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-viperin antibody for 1h at 4°C, at final
concentration 0.5 μM, in the presence of dithiothritol (5 mM) and CTP (300 μM). The protein-antibody
complex was incubated with pre-equilibrated protein A/G beads (pre-blocked with 2mg/ml Bovine
Serum albumin protein overnight at 4°C) for 1h at 4°C. Recombinant prey proteins NS5A-ΔN39 and
VAP-33-ΔC20 were incubated with viperin-antibody-bead-complex at a final concentration of 1µM for
30 minutes at 4°C. Flow-through was collected using Pierce gravity columns and washed three times
with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.0% Tween-20. Immuno-complexes were eluted

by boiling in 1x SDS-PAGE sample buffer outside Coy chamber and immunoblotted with appropriate
antibodies.
In vitro SAM cleavage assay The reaction containing purified 5 uM viperin-ΔN50, 7.5 uM NS5A-ΔN39
or VAP-33-ΔC20 or both in 50 mM tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 100 uM Ltryptophan (internal standard), and 300 uM CTP were incubated on cold beads for 2 hours under
anaerobic conditions to allow for complex formation. The reactions were then incubated at 37°C for
5 minutes after the addition of 5 mM dithionite. Finally, 200 uM SAM was added to each reaction and
20 uL aliquots were taken at various time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 minutes). Each sample was
quenched with 20 uL of 50 mM H2SO4 solution. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10
minutes to precipitate protein before loading it on to a Vydac 201TP 10 µm C18 column (250 X 4.6
mm, 10 µm particle size). Buffer A was 0.01% TFA in DI water and buffer B was 0.01% TFA in
acetonitrile. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and the following gradient was applied: 0% B for 0.01
minutes, 0-5% B from 0.01-5.01 minutes, 5% B from 5.01-5.31 minutes, 5-75% B from 5.31-25.31
minutes, 75% B from 25.31-26.31 minutes, 75-100% B from 26.31-27.01 minutes, 100% B from 27.0132.01 minutes, 100-0% B from 32.01-32.31 minutes, 0% B from 32.31-36.31 minutes. The internal
standard peak (L-tryptophan) was observed at 13.25 minutes and the 5’deoxyadenosine (5’dA) peak
was observed at 10.10 minutes. The peaks were integrated using LCSolution software.

transfected viperin or viperin-Δ3C (lacking the iron-sulfur cluster), NS5A and or FLAG-hVAPc (cterminal of VAP-33) were immunoprecipitated using anti-viperin antibody and blots probed with antiNS5A monoclonal and anti-FLAG (for hVAPc) antibody. The results demonstrate that viperin and

Figure 5: Co-immunoprecipitation of recombinant NS5A-Δ39 and VAP-33-ΔC20 using purified
viperin-ΔN50 (lacking the membrane associated sequence) as bait protein in vitro: Recombinant
viperin was incubated with its possible prey protein recombinant NS5A-ΔN39 and VAP-33-ΔC20,
followed by its immunoprecipitation, using anti-viperin antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples
were immunoblotted with anti-his antibody to probe for the proteins. No specific interaction was
observed between viperin and NS5A in presence and absence of VAP-33, suggesting that the
membrane associated sequence of these interacting proteins are important for protein-complex
formation.

Figure 6: Recombinant NS5A and VAP-33, lacking the membrane associated domain, did not change
the reductive SAM cleavage activity of recombinant viperin in vitro. Activity of purified viperin
(viperin-ΔN50) was assessed by monitoring the rate of 5’-deoxyadenosine production. The turnover
of 5’-deoxyadenosine by viperin was calculated from the linear fitting curve. Viperin showed the
turnover of 4.1 ± 0.3 h-1 alone and 2.7 ± 0.2 h-1, 2.8 ± 0.1 h-1, 2.8 ± 0.1 h-1 when incubated with
recombinant NS5A (NS5A-ΔN39), VAP-33 (VAP-33-ΔC20) or both, respectively. Overall, no significant
change was observed in the activity of viperin, when combined with purified NS5A and VAP-33.

Figure 7: Overview of the functional interactions between NS5A and viperin. Viperin exerts anti-viral
activity against Hepatitis C virus by promoting the degradation of NS5A in the replication complex. In
contrast, NS5A reduces the catalytic activity of viperin, decreasing ddhCTP levels. Membrane
localization of viperin, NS5A and proviral adaptor protein VAP-33 is crucial for the interactions

Figure SI.1: NS5A co-localizes with viperin or viperin-Δ3C at endoplasmic-reticulum
Immunofluorescence microscopy of HEK293T cells co-transfected with viperin (upper panel) or
viperin-Δ3C (lower panel) and NS5A, in presence of hVAPc. The cells were immobilized 30 hours posttransfection and stained for viperin (green) and NS5A (red). Both viperin and viperin-Δ3C co-localize
(yellow in merged images) with NS5A.

Figure SI.2: Expression level of viperin, viperin-Δ3C and hVAPc. HEK293T cells were transfected with
genes of NS5A, FLAG-hVAPc and viperin or viperin-Δ3C and immunoblotted for viperin, viperin-Δ3C,
hVAPc and GAPDH (loading control) 30 hours post-transfection. (a) Viperin and viperin-Δ3C, showed
reduced expression when co-transfected with NS5A and hVAPc. (b) The expression level of hVAPc
remained the same, regardless the presence of viperin and NS5A.

Figure SI.3: Co-expression of NS5A and hVAPc inhibits reductive SAM cleavage activity of Viperin in
HEK293T cell-lysates (contd.). (a) Immunoblotting of vipeirn, NS5A and hVAPc present in the samples.
(b) The relative activity was of viperin was determined by the ratio of 5’-deoxyadenosine produced to
amount of viperin present in the sample per hour.

Figure SI.4: Non-specific oligomerization of recombinant viperin, NS5A and VAP33 in vitro after
chemical crosslinking assay. Purified viperin (viperin-ΔN50), NS5A (NS5A-Δ39) and VAP-33 (VAP-33ΔC20) were incubated with each other or by itself prior to the addition of chemical crosslinker BS3.
The three proteins individually formed dimers and showed non-specific oligomerization in the
presence other partner protein. The protein complex among these three proteins was not observed.
