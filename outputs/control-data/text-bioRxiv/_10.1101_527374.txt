ABSTRACT
Although the relative expansion of the frontal cortex in primate evolution is generally
accepted, the nature of the human uniqueness, if any, and between-species anatomofunctional comparisons of the frontal areas remain controversial. To provide a novel
interpretation of the evolution of primate brains, sulcal morphological variability of the medial
frontal cortex was assessed in old-world monkeys (macaque, baboon) and Hominoidea
(chimpanzee, human). We discovered that both Hominoidea do possess a paracingulate
sulcus, which was previously thought to be uniquely human and linked to higher cognitive
functions like mentalizing. Also, we revealed systematic sulcal morphological organisations of
the medial frontal cortex that can be traced from multiple old-world monkey to Hominoidea
species, demonstrating an evolutionary conserved organizational principle. Our data provide
a new framework to compare sulcal morphology, cytoarchitectonic areal distribution,
connectivity, and function across the primate order, leading to clear predictions on how other
primate brains might be anatomo-functionally organized.

INTRODUCTION
Is the human brain unique? Although the relative expansion of the frontal cortex in
primate evolution is generally accepted, the nature of the changes that occur remains
controversial. Neuroanatomy offers a window into the evolution of brain circuits and its
correlates, brain functions. Looking at a macroscopic level, a large literature has emphasized
the link between the extent of gyrification, the rapid expansion of the cerebral cortex, and the
complexity of the computational processing performed in a given brain (e.g. Zilles et al., 1989,
2013). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of sulci and gyri: genetic
control (Rakic, 2004), cortical growth (Toro and Burnod, 2005), tension of white matter
cortico-cortical axons (Van Essen, 1997; Hilgetag and Barbas, 2005, 2006), cortico-thalamic
axons (Rakic, 1988), or simply mechanical instability in a soft tissue growing non-uniformly
(Tallinen et al., 2014; Amiez et al., 2018; Van Essen et al., 2018). Although important, these
discussions of cortical gyrification have not considered another major dimension of sulcal
pattern organization, i.e. its variability. Interindividual variability of traits are at the basis of
many evolutionary genetic studies (Harris, 1966; Przeworski et al., 2000). Therefore, the
primary goal of our study was to investigate variability in sulcal phenotypes from four key
primate populations to provide a new understanding into evolution of primate frontal cortex.
Sulcal organization is not random despite the presence of strong inter-hemispheric and
inter-subject variability (Petrides, 2012). Rather, it follows a precise topographical
organization. The most straightforward example is the location of the central sulcus. Although
its shape, length, and depth may vary across hemispheres and individuals, it is always present
and systematically located at the same strategic antero-posterior location. Importantly, this is
not a human specific feature as it is observed in all primates (Sherwood et al., 2004; Hopkins
et al., 2014). In primates, although the origin of gyrification is not well understood, three types
of sulci can be identified based on their appearance during gestation: primary sulci (e.g.
central sulcus) are the earliest formed during gestation (i.e. before the 30th week of gestation
in human), followed by secondary sulci (e.g. paracingulate sulcus, formed between the 32nd
and the 36th week of gestation in human), and finally tertiary sulci (formed between the 36th
week of gestation and the end of the first year of life in human) (Armstrong et al., 1995;
Tamraz and Comair, 2000). Importantly, although primary sulci are present in all hemispheres

in all individuals, the probability of observing secondary/tertiary sulci is variable. For instance,
the cingulate sulcus (CGS) in the Medial Frontal Cortex (MFC) is a primary sulcus and as such
is observed in 100% of hemispheres; by contrast the paracingulate sulcus (PCGS), a sulcus
running parallel to the CGS, is a secondary sulcus and is present only in about 70% of human
subjects at least in one hemisphere (Vogt et al., 1995, 2005; Paus et al., 1996; Amiez et al.,
2018).
Importantly, several lines of evidence indicate that primary sulci are limiting sulci
between cytoarchitectonic areas. For instance, the central sulcus is the limiting sulcus
between the primary motor cortex (area 4) and the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3). In
addition, one study (Vogt et al., 2005) has shown that the cytoarchitectonic organization of
the cingulate cortical region is modulated, depending on the presence/absence of a secondary
sulcus in the cingulate cortex, namely the PCGS. In addition, several studies performing single
subject analysis have demonstrated that the organization of sulci and its variability is also
pertinent to prediction of the localization of functional areas (Tomaiuolo and Giordano, 2016).
For instance, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that the
primary hand motor area is always located in the central sulcus in human and non-human
primates (Yousry et al., 1997; Amiez and Petrides, 2014, 2018; Hopkins et al., 2014), the frontal
eye field is always located in the ventral branch of the superior precentral sulcus in the human
brain (Amiez et al., 2006; Amiez and Petrides, 2009, 2018; Derrfuss et al., 2012) and in the
genu of the arcuate sulcus in macaque (Bruce and Goldberg, 1985; Koyama et al., 2004), the
face motor representation of the rostral cingulate motor area and the juice feedback-related
activity during exploratory situations recruits a region located in the CGS when no PCGS is
present, but in the PCGS when the CGS is present (Amiez et al., 2013; Amiez and Petrides,
2014). Comparable observations were made in other regions of the brain, such as the inferior
frontal junction (Derrfuss et al., 2009, 2012), the orbitofrontal cortex (Li et al., 2015), the
parietal somatomotor cortex (Zlatkina et al., 2016), and the angular gyrus region (Segal and
Petrides, 2013). Collectively, these studies strongly suggest that the sulcal organization in
primates is not random, but rather has anatomo-functional relevance that are likely
associated with the evolution to increasingly sophisticated sensory, motor, and cognitive
functions. To what extent sulcal morphology across primate brains can provide insights into
the anatomo-functional organization of the brains in higher primates and brain evolution in
the primate order is, however, poorly understood.

The aim of the present study was to determine how the MFC sulcal organization has
evolved through the primate order, a region often neglected in comparative studies (Van
Essen and Dierker, 2007), despite its key role in cognitive functions often thought to be
uniquely human, such as mentalizing or counterfactual thinking (Amodio and Frith, 2006).
Opposing views suggest that the MFC is functionally comparable in humans and macaque
(Sallet et al., 2013; Amiez et al., 2016). As mentioned above, several studies have shown that
strong relationships exist between sulcal morphology and functional organization in the
human brain. Based on neuroimaging anatomical scans, we investigated the sulci
morphological variability from old-world monkeys (80 macaques and 88 baboons) and
Hominoidea (225 chimpanzees and 197 humans) to identify potential specific properties of
the human MFC. We discovered that the analysis of the sulcal organization in the MFC in
primates provides critical new evidence of how the prefrontal cortex evolved within the order
Primates. We discovered that both Hominoidea do possess a paracingulate sulcus, which was
previously thought to be uniquely human and linked to higher cognitive functions like
mentalizing. We also confirmed the expansion of the most rostral part of the medial prefrontal
cortex in Humans. But overall, we revealed systematic sulcal morphological organisations of
the medial frontal cortex that can be traced from multiple old-world monkey to Hominoidea
species, demonstrating an evolutionary conserved organizational principle.

RESULTS
The PCGS, an ape innovation
A major finding of the present analysis was the demonstration of the presence of the
PCGS in at least one hemisphere within human and chimpanzee brains but not in baboon and
macaque brains (χ2 = 242.18, df = 3, p-value = 2.2e-16, logistic regression, GLM fitted using an

adjusted-score approach to bias reduction) (Fig 1A, B, C, D, E).

Figure 1. Presence of the paracingulate sulcus (PCGS) across primates. The location of the
cingulate sulcus (CGS) is shown in red in typical hemispheres displaying no PCGS versus those
displaying a PCGS in human (A), chimpanzee (B), and in typical hemispheres of baboon (C) and
macaque (D) brains. The location of the PCGS is shown in yellow in typical hemispheres
displaying a PCGS in human (A) and chimpanzee (B). The present analysis demonstrated the
presence of PCGS in both human and chimpanzee brains, but not in baboon and macaque
brains (E). The probability of occurrence of a PCGS decreased from human to chimpanzee. The
PCGS is lateralized in the left hemisphere in human, but not in chimpanzee, brains. Statistics:
* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, ns non-significant.
A post-hoc Tukey test revealed that the probability of occurrence of a PCGS differed
significantly between human and chimpanzee brains with a PCGS in least in one hemisphere
in 70.1% of human versus 33.8% of chimpanzee brains (estimate=1.47562, std. error=0.20917,

z-value=7.054, p-value<0.001) (Fig 1E). Interestingly, humans and chimpanzees differed with
respect to asymmetries in the PCGS. In human brains, the PCGS was present in the left
hemisphere only in 35% of subjects, in the right hemisphere only in 12.7% of subjects, and in
both hemispheres in 22.8% of subjects, a distribution that differed significantly (χ2 = 19.912,
df = 1, p-value = 8.109e-06, logistic regression) (Fig 1E). In contrast, in chimpanzee, the PCGS
was present in the left hemisphere only in 12.9% of subjects, in the right hemisphere only in
14.2% of subjects, and in both hemispheres in 6.7% of subjects, a distribution that did not
significantly differ (χ2 = 0.12399, df = 1, p-value = 0.7247).
The presence or absence of an intralimbic sulcus (ILS, i.e. a shallow sulcus running
parallel and ventral to the cingulate sulcus), was also characterized in our primate sample. The
ILS was observed in at least one hemisphere in 27%, 18.7%, 12.5%, and 11.3% of human,
chimpanzee, baboon, and macaque brains (Fig 2A), which were significantly different (χ2 =
18.993, df = 3, p-value = 0.0002743, logistic regression). Post-hoc Tukey analysis revealed that
the presence of ILS in humans was significantly higher than all other primate species. Further,
no significant differences in the presence of the ILS were found between the three non-human
primate species (chimpanzee versus baboon: p=0.5502, chimpanzee versus macaque:
p=0.4176, baboon versus macaque: p=0.9942).
We also tested for asymmetries in the presence of ILS within each species. No
interhemispheric differences were found in humans (χ2 = 0.68999, df = 1, p-value = 0.4062
(ns), baboons (χ2 = 3.3591, df = 1, p-value = 0.06684 (ns), or rhesus monkeys (χ2 = 0.42938, df
= 1, p-value = 0.5123 (ns), logistic regression). However, the ILS was found to be present
significantly more often in the left than right hemisphere in chimpanzees (χ2 = 10.419, df = 1,
p-value = 0.001247, logistic regression). Lastly, in Hominoidea, when a PCGS was present, the
ILS was almost always absent (Fig 2B) (Human: presence of ILS in hemispheres with versus
hemispheres without a PCGS: χ2 = 30.221, df = 1, p-value = 3.855e-08; Chimpanzee: χ2 =
14.011, df = 1, p-value = 0.0001817, logistic regression).

The probability of occurrence of an ILS is higher in human brains compared with non-human

the three non-human primate species. Only in chimpanzee brains, the probability to observe
an ILS is higher in the left than in the right hemisphere. By contrast, no difference between the

The dorsal medial frontal cortex, a well-preserved structural organization
across primates
There are several lines of evidences suggesting that the dorsal medial frontal cortex is
comparable in terms of cytoarchitectonic areal distribution, connectivity, and functions across
macaque and human brains (Cole et al., 2009, 2010; Procyk et al., 2016; Vogt, 2016). The
present analysis adds up on these results revealing that the sulcal organization of this region
is well-preserved too.
In the human brain, posterior to the genu of the corpus callosum, we identified four
sulci vertical to the CGS or the PCGS including the paracentral sulcus (PACS), the preparacentral sulcus (PRPACS), the posterior (VPCGS-P) and the anterior (VPCGS-A) vertical
paracingulate sulci (Fig 3). For each of these sulci, we characterized them as either fully
present, as a spur or dimple when only superficially evident, or absent. For this analysis, we
considered the presence of spurs or dimples, which were observed almost entirely in the
baboon and rhesus monkey samples, as precursors to their full sulci expression in
chimpanzees and humans (see below and FIG S1). Our argument for considering spurs and
dimples as precursors of each of the 4 sulci in rhesus monkeys and baboons comes from an
analysis of their normalized spatial location relatively to human and chimpanzee brains (see
below). Specifically, we observed that the PACS, PRPACS, VPCGS-P and VPCGS-A sulci, spurs
or dimples could be reliably located with respect to four anatomical landmarks: the rostral
limit of the pons, anterior commissure, caudal limit of the genu of the corpus callosum, and
the rostral limit of corpus callosum (see FIG 3A). To assess the consistency in the occurrence
of PACS, PRPACS, VPCGS-P and VPCGS-A with respect to these landmarks, we calculated the
difference between the Y value of the intersection between the CGS and the PACS and the Y
value of each anatomical landmark. Note that the MRI data of the four species were first
normalized in their respective normalized space (see Method). This difference was then
normalized to take into account the different antero-posterior extent of the brains of the four
species (i.e. antero-posterior extent of the human, chimpanzee, baboon, and macaque brains
are respectively 175, 110, 85 and 60 mm). These results are shown in FIG3B to 3E and, as can
be seen, the variability around the standardized location of each sulcus relative to their
anatomical landmark were consistent within and between species.

When evaluating the probability of occurrence of each of the 4 vertically oriented sulci
along the CGS or PCGS, significant species differences were found for PACS (χ2 = 43.068, df =
1, p = 2.381e-09), PRPACS (χ2 = 49.192, df = 3, p = 1.187e-10), VPCGS-P (χ2 = 108.8, df = 3, p =
2.2e-16) and VPCGS-A (χ2 = 83.311, df = 3, p = 2.2e-16) (see FIG 3A to 3D). For PACS, VPCGS-P

and VPCGS-A, post-hoc analysis indicated that these sulci were present in a higher proportion
of human brains compared to chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys and baboons. Additionally, the
percentage of chimpanzee brains displaying a PACS, VPCGS-A and VPCGS-P was significantly
higher compared to rhesus monkeys and baboons; however, there was no significant
difference in the probability of occurrence between baboons and rhesus monkeys. For
PRPACS, post-hoc analysis indicated that its probability of occurrence was significantly higher
in humans and chimpanzee brains compared to rhesus monkeys and baboons. There were no
significant differences in its occurrence between human and chimpanzee brains nor between
baboon and macaque brains.
In sum, the four vertical sulci, or their precursors, can be found across the four primate
species examined in the current study. In humans, the four sulci are equally and largely
present in both hemispheres (χ2 = 4.6815, df = 3, p = 0.1967). By contrast, their co-occurrence
is not equally present in chimpanzees (χ2 = 68.917, df = 1, p = 7.279e-15), baboons (χ2 =
38.617, df = 1, p = 2.092e-08), and rhesus monkeys (χ2 = 67.617, df = 1, p = 1.382e-14]. As can
be seen in Fig 4A to D, PACS, PRPACS, and VPCGS-A are the most conserved sulci across
primate species, while VPCGS-P is the least conserved sulcus (Fig 4). Chimpanzee brains
display a sulcal organization of the dorsal medial frontal cortex comparable to that of the
human brain, macaque and baboon brains display evidence of the emergence of this
organization. Importantly, vertical sulci emerging from the CGS or the PCGS located in the
dorsal medial frontal cortex can be identified within fixed anatomical landmarks that are
present across primates.

The anterior cingulate (ACC), ventral medial prefrontal (vmPFC) and the
frontopolar cortex
The ACC, vmPFC, and medial frontopolar cortex are the focus of many studies on,
respectively, emotional processing (Caruana et al., 2018), value-based decision-making
(Rushworth et al., 2011; Papageorgiou et al., 2017), and high-order socio-cognitive processing
(e.g. mentalizing (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Vaccaro and Fleming, 2018; Wittmann et al., 2018)).
These abilities reach their epitope in humans, strongly suggesting that these cortical areas
have evolved. The present analysis reveals how these regions have evolved, providing a
structural substrate for improved abilities in the primate order.
Anterior to the genu of the corpus callosum, we identified in human brains up to 9
distinct sulci (Lopez-Persem et al. in revision). One of the distinct features of the vmPFC is the
branching of sulci at the end of the CGS. In human brains, the rostral end of the cingulate
sulcus is characterized by two sulci forming a downward bifurcation: the supra-rostral sulcus
(SU-ROS) and the supra-orbital sulcus (SOS) (Fig 5A). When the PCGS is absent, the fork is
located at the rostral end of the CGS but, when the PCGS is present, it is located at the rostral
end of the PCGS in the large majority of hemispheres (Fig S2).

hemispheres. In macaque. The fork formed by CGS-VE and CGS-DE is displaying the same
possible patterns than the baboon but in different proportions: the most frequent pattern
observed is a fork facing forward, followed by a fork looking downward. The fork is incomplete

was then normalized for brain size to compare across primate brains. Mean normalized rZ

intersection with the CGS or the PCGS is located close to the level of the apex of the genu of

In the non-human primates, a majority of the brains displayed different sulcal patterns
at the rostral end of the CGS. The complexity and orientation of these folds were highly
variable between species. Because of this discrepancy with the observed pattern in human
brains, we chose to label the sulci at the end of the CGS, the ventral (CGS-VE) and dorsal (CGSDE) extension of the cingulate sulcus. We viewed the CGS-VE and the CGS-DE in the nonhuman
primate brains as precursors of the human SU-ROS and SOS respectively.
In chimpanzees, the fork formed by the CGS-VE and CGS-DE extension of the cingulate
sulcus was also oriented downward in the majority of hemispheres (81.25%). However, in
17.5% of hemispheres, the fork was forward facing, and was incomplete (i.e. SOS is present
but SU-ROS sulcus is absent) in 1.25% of hemispheres (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, as in humans,
when the PCGS is absent, the fork is located at the rostral end of the CGS. By contrast, when
the PCGS is present in the chimpanzee brain, the fork was is still located at the rostral end of
the CGS -and not at the PCGS as in human- in the large majority of hemispheres (Fig S2).
In baboons, the fork formed by CGS-VE and CGS-DE is also oriented downward in the
majority of hemispheres but to a lesser extent (40%) compared to humans and chimpanzees.
In 25% of hemispheres, the fork is forward facing, is incomplete in 28.75% of hemispheres,
and absent in 6.25% of hemispheres (Fig. 5A). In rhesus monkeys, the fork formed by CGS-VE
and CGS-DE displays the same patterns than in baboons but in different proportions: the most
frequent pattern observed is a forward-facing fork (in 45% of hemispheres), followed by a fork
oriented downward (in 23.75% of hemispheres). The fork is incomplete in 13.75% of
hemispheres and is absent in 17.5% of hemispheres (Fig. 5A).

To assess the relative location of the intersection of this fork with the CGS or PCGS
across primates, we calculated the percentage of displacement of this intersection from the
apex of the genu of the corpus callosum. This displacement was normalized across primates
on the basis of the dorso-ventral extent of the brains normalized in their respective standard
space (see Methods) at the level of the genu of the corpus callous across primates (i.e. 100mm,
50mm, 30mm, and 24mm, respectively in human, chimpanzee, baboon, and macaque brains).
Results showed that the intersection of this fork with the CGS or the PCGS is located at the
level of the apex of the genu of the corpus callosum in humans (Fig 5B), but is located dorsal
to it in the non-human primate brains (F(3,298)=43.506, p<2.2e-16, GLM), strongly suggesting
that this has migrated downward in the human brain.
Ventral to SU-ROS or CGS-VE lies the superior rostral sulcus (ROS-S). The ROS-S is a long
and deep sulcus that is present in nearly 100% of hemispheres across all four species and
therefore does no differ significantly in its occurrence (χ2 = 4.5334, df = 3, p = 0.2093) (Fig 6A).
The ROS-S is often connected to the accessory supra-orbital sulcus (ASOS) and this sulcus is
equally present in human (88.75%) and chimpanzee (81.25%) hemispheres. The ASOS is
observed significantly less often in the baboon (26.25%) and rhesus monkey (21.25%)
hemispheres compared to the chimpanzees and humans (χ2 = 132.81, df = 3, p-value = 2.2e16, logistic regression (Fig 6B).
The most ventral sulcus within the vmPFC is the inferior rostral sulcus (ROS-I). This
sulcus is equally present in human (35%) and chimpanzee (37.5%) hemispheres but largely
absent in the baboons (3%) and rhesus monkeys (1.5%) (χ2 = 60.348, df = 3, p = 4.952e-13,)
(Fig 6C).

Finally, we observed at the most rostral part of the frontal cortex, several sulci that are

brain, an additional vertical sulcus joining the CGS or PCGS anterior to the rostral part of the
genu of the corpus callosum which was labeled the rostro-perpendicular paracingulate sulcus

(RP-PCGS) (Fig 7A). In addition, we observed a sulcus located just dorsal to SOS, which joins
the lateral surface of the brain but not the CGS or PCGS, called the dorsomedial polar sulcus
(DMPS) in 88.75% of hemispheres in human and in 48.75% of hemispheres in chimpanzee. By
contrast, only 2.5% of hemispheres of baboon brains display this sulcus and no hemispheres
in macaque brains (χ2 = 227.43, df = 3, p-value = 2.2e-16). A second sulcus, the ventromedial
polar sulcus (VMPS), located in the ventral medial frontal cortex, joining the lateral surface of
the brain and sometimes the ROS-I, was identified more frequently in humans (57.5% of
hemispheres) than in chimpanzee (11.25% of hemispheres) and was absent in baboons and

DISCUSSION
While gyrification correlates with brain volume (Rogers et al., 2010; Zilles et al., 2013),
and therefore with the expansion of primate neocortex, careful analysis of sulcal brain
morphology has proven to be a powerful complementary method for a better understanding
of the evolution of the medial frontal cortex in primates. Here, we describe for the first time
that chimpanzees possess a PCGS, which was previously thought to be a uniquely human
feature (Cole et al., 2009, 2010; Vogt, 2016). Two differences must, however, be emphasized:
1) the probability of occurrence of a PCGS is lower in the chimpanzee than in the human brain
(present at least in one hemisphere in 70.1% of human versus 33.8% of chimpanzee, Fig 1E),
and 2) the presence of a PCGS is largely lateralized in the left hemisphere in the human brain,
whereas it is equally present in both hemispheres in the chimpanzee (Fig 1E). Notably, only in
the chimpanzee, the probability of occurrence of an ILS is higher in the left than in the right
hemisphere (Fig 2A). The ILS being observed only in hemispheres displaying no PCGS in human
and chimpanzee (Fig 2B), one can hypothesize that the lateralized presence of an ILS in the
left hemisphere in chimpanzee brains may constitute an evolutionary reflection of the
beginnings of the sulcal organization as observed in the human brain, i.e. a PCGS lateralized
in the left hemisphere and an ILS not lateralized.
Another major difference between the primate species examined was the organization
of the medial prefrontal cortex rostral to the genu of the corpus callosum. Differences were
associated with 1) a sulcus only observed in humans, the rostro-perpendicular paracingulate
sulcus (RP-PCGS), 2) the progressive emergence of the DMPS and VMPS, and 3) the SUROS/SOS intersection that is displaced downwards from the level of the apex of the genu of
the corpus callosum as one compares more distantly related primates to humans. There is no
evidence from cytoarchitectonic (Petrides and Pandya, 1994; Petrides et al., 2012) and
neuroimaging (Sallet et al., 2013; Neubert et al., 2015) studies that these changes are
associated with new cortical areas, suggesting instead differential expansion of 1) the rostral
medial prefrontal cortex (area 9) and medial frontopolar cortex (area 10), two brain regions
that have been considered important for high-order socio-cognitive processing, such as
mentalizing (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Vaccaro and Fleming, 2018; Wittmann et al., 2018) and
2) the ventromedial frontal cortex (VMPFC) implicated in value-based decisions (Rushworth

et al., 2011; Papageorgiou et al., 2017). Our results are in line with a recent study showing that
the anterior cingulate/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (ACC/VMPFC) is a region of high
structural variability within the human brain and also within the macaque brain (Croxson et
al., 2018). By examining the morphological sulcal variability in this region across four primate
brains, our results provide an explanation of the nature of this variability.
Furthermore, by comparison with the ACC/VMPFC region, the data demonstrate that,
in Old-world monkeys, the organization of the medial frontal cortex (MFC) posterior to the
genu of the corpus callosum (where medial motor and premotor areas lie and which
corresponds to the Mid-Cingulate Cortex, MCC), has all the basic features of the human sulcal
organization and reaches a similar organization across Hominoidea. Specifically, Old world
monkeys display precursors –in the form of spurs or dimples- of the four vertical sulci of this
region: PACS, PRPACS, VPCGS-P and VPCGS-A. This result is of great importance as it provides
additional evidence that the MCC is comparable both anatomically and functionally across
macaque and human brains (see Procyk et al. (Procyk et al., 2016) for a detailed anatomofunctional comparison), contrary to what has been proposed by some (Cole et al., 2009, 2010;
Vogt, 2016). Importantly, we show for the first time that these sulci refer to specific and highlyreliable anatomical features, and we provide a simple framework to identify these sulci: PACS
is located at the level of the rostral limit of the pons, PRPACS at the level of the anterior
commissure, VPCGS-P and VPCGS-A at the level of the caudal and rostral limit of the genu of
the corpus callosum, respectively. Moreover, these landmarks could be used to guide
interpretation of functional neuroimaging studies. Our results also show that the most ventral
part of the MFC is highly preserved from macaque to human. ROS-S, which is in the center of
this region, is a deep sulcus in all primate species. Importantly, it has been recently shown that
the main ventromedial prefrontal node of the default mode network lies in this sulcus in the
human brain (Lopez-Persem et al., 2018). Importantly, the macaque default brain network
was recently shown to be comparable to that observed in the human brain (Mars et al., 2012;
Margulies et al., 2016), providing further support to our present demonstration that the sulcal
organization of this region is conserved across the primates examined.
Collectively, the results presented here provide 1) strong evidence for a comparable
organization of the MCC across primates and 2) a clear framework to test further hypotheses
regarding the relation between the vertical sulci/spurs/dimples, cytoarchitectonic areas, and
functions. For example, there is some evidence that PACS may be a sulcus occurring at the

border between medial area 4 and area 6 in several primate species: human (Brodmann, 1909;
Bucy, 1944; Sarkissov et al., 1955), orangutan (Mauss, 1911; Bucy, 1944), and macaques (Bucy,
1935). Finally, as no new areas have been identified in the human medial frontal cortex in
neuroimaging (Sallet et al., 2013; Neubert et al., 2015) and cytoarchitectonic (Petrides and
Pandya, 1994; Petrides et al., 2012) studies, one could suggest the emergence of a new sulcus
present in the medial cortical region of the human brain might reflect the relative expansion
of this region compared to other primates. For instance, we suggest that the RP-PCGS reflects
the expansion of medial area 9, a region thought to be important for social metacognitive
abilities (Amodio and Frith, 2006; Vaccaro and Fleming, 2018; Wittmann et al., 2018).
Future studies can also test for the relationships between the vertical sulci of the
cingulate/paracingulate sulci and cytoarchitectonic areas. Based on cytoarchitectonic studies,
Vogt has proposed a hierarchical model of the organization of the cingulate cortex. At the
higher level one could distinguish, both in humans and monkeys, a four-region organization
(Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2009; Vogt, 2016). This model emphasizes the distinction between
the anterior cingulate cortex -ACC- (anterior to the rostral limit of the genu of the corpus
callosum), the anterior and the posterior mid-cingulate cortex -aMCC and pMCC-, the
posterior cingulate cortex -PCC-, and the retrosplenial cortex. We superimposed this model
on our sulcal organization scheme presented here in human and macaque to examine
whether the vertical sulci may have significant meanings on the anatomo-functional
organization of the cingulate cortex. Based on the consistent location of the vertical sulci we
have demonstrated above, one can hypothesize that the VPCGS-A, which is located at the
rostral limit of the genu of the corpus callosum and is better conserved than the VPCGS-P
across primates, may be a reliable landmark to distinguish the ACC from the aMCC in both
human and macaque brains. Vogt’s model identifies the limit between aMCC and pMCC as
being the anterior commissure and we demonstrated that the pre-paracentral sulcus
(PRPACS) is systematically located at the level of the anterior commissure and is highly
conserved across primates. As such, this sulcus might be a limiting sulcus between aMCC and
pMCC in both human and macaque brains. Finally, the paracentral sulcus (PACS) which is
located at the level of the rostral limit of the pons might be the limit between pMCC and PCC
in both human and macaque. Although there is no currently available information about the
four-region model in the medial cortex of baboon and chimpanzee brains, our demonstration
that the vertical sulci examined are conserved and hold the same location as in human and

macaque brains, one can infer that these sulci are limiting the same regions. This hypothesis
is displayed in Fig S3 and future studies can assess whether these sulci are limiting functional
and cytoarchitectonic areas in these species. Altogether, these data provide strong evidence
that the dorsal medial frontal cortex is highly conserved from macaque to human. It is
important to note, however, that whether sulci relate to cytoarchitectonic areas remains
controversial (Córcoles-Parada et al., 2017; Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles, 2018) and requires
considerably more investigations in appropriately sectioned brains. It should be emphasized
that proper examination of the relation of sulci to cytoarchitectonic areas requires histological
sections perpendicular to the orientation of a given sulcus, as was originally pointed out by
Economo and Koskinas (1925) (Economo and Koskinas, 1925).
Besides sulci, we propose that other anatomical landmarks could help guide
interpretation of the functional organization of the medial frontal cortex. This is a relevant
question as New-world monkeys include species with gyrified brains (e.g. capuchin and
squirrel monkeys) and species with lissencephalic brains (e.g. the marmoset) (Van Essen and
Dierker, 2007; Chaplin et al., 2013; Donahue et al., 2018). Importantly, it has been shown that
the relative position and cytoarchitecture of homologous areas in New versus Old World
monkeys are similar (Paxinos et al., 2008, 2012), despite a different brain size (Chaplin et al.,
2013). On the basis of the framework provided by the present study, it would be reasonable
to hypothesize that homologous cytoarchitectonic and functional regions in the medial frontal
cortex in New-world monkeys may be identified using landmarks common to all primates: the
PCC/MCC limit should be located at the level of the rostral part of the pons (where PACS is
found in old world monkeys, apes, and human). The MCC should expand from this location to
the anterior part of the genu of the corpus callosum, i.e. where the VPCGS-A is found and
which corresponds to the limit between MCC and ACC. As in humans, we also predict the
border between Supplementary Motor Area and Pre-Supplementary Motor Area to be at the

To conclude, our study provides critical new evidence in the context of a new
comprehensive framework regarding prefrontal cortical evolution (summarized in Fig 8). We
anticipate that this framework will be used to examine the relationships between sulcal

METHODS
Neuroimaging T1 anatomical data of 197 humans, 225 chimpanzees, 88 baboons and 80
macaque brains were analyzed.
Human subjects. High-resolution anatomical human scans were obtained from the Human
Connectome Project database (humanconnectome.org). Only data from subjects displaying
no family relationships were analyzed. The participants in the HCP study were recruited from
the Missouri Family and Twin Registry that includes individuals born in Missouri (Van Essen et
al., 2012). Acquisition parameters of T1 anatomical scans are the following: whole head,
0.7mm3 isotropic resolution, TR=2.4s, TE=2.14ms, flip angle = 8° (more details can be found
on
https://humanconnectome.org/storage/app/media/documentation/s1200/HCP_S1200_Rele
ase_Appendix_I.pdf. The full set of inclusion and exclusion criteria is detailed elsewhere (Van
Essen et al.,2012). In short, the HCP subjects are healthy individuals who are free from major
psychiatric or neurological illnesses. They are drawn from ongoing longitudinal studies (Edens
et al., 2010; Sartor et al., 2011; Van Essen et al., 2012), where they received extensive previous
assessments including the history of drug use, emotional, and behavioral problems. The
experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and all
experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) (IRB #
201204036; Title: ‘Mapping the Human Connectome: Structure, Function, and Heritability').
All subjects provided written informed consent on forms approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Washington University in St Louis. In addition, the present study received approval
(n°15-213) from the ethic committee of Inserm (IORG0003254, FWA00005831) and from the
Institutional Review Board (IRB00003888) of the French institute of medical research and
health.
Non-human primates. High-resolution anatomical scans of chimpanzee and baboon brains
were acquired in the laboratories of Dr. William Hopkins and Dr. Adrien Meguerditchian,
respectively. High-resolution anatomical scans of macaque were acquired in the laboratories
or Drs E. Procyk/C. Amiez, W. Hopkins, J. Sallet, F. Hadj-Bouziane, and S. Ben Hamed.

Neuroimaging data analysis. Human and macaque brains were normalized in the human
(http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/HomePage) and macaque (Frey et al., 2011)
MNI steretotaxic coordinate system, respectively. Chimpanzee brains were normalized in the
chimpanzee standard brain developed by Dr. W. Hopkins (Hopkins and Avants, 2013). Baboon
brains were normalized in the baboon standard brain developed by Dr. A. Meguerditchian
(Love et al., 2016).
Two levels of analysis were performed:
1) A large qualitative analysis in the whole set of data (i.e. 197 human, 225 chimpanzee,
88 baboon and 80 macaque brains). This large analysis was performed to identify
whether the paracingulate sulcus (PCGS) and the intralimbic sulcus (ILS) were humanspecific features. For that goal, we visually inspected each MRI scan to assess the
presence or absence of these sulci in both hemispheres of each normalized brain of
each species were assessed.
2) A restricted qualitative/quantitative analysis of all sulci of the medial frontal cortex
in both hemispheres of a subset of 40 brains of each species. This analysis consisted
first in assessing the characteristics of the vertical sulci in the superior medial frontal
cortex emerging from the cingulate (CGS) or the PCGS in all brains across species. For
that goal, the sulci were assigned in one of 3 categories based on our qualitative
observations (Fig S1): sulcus (a real sulcus -long and deep- can be observed), spur (a
precursor sulcus, i.e. not long enough to be considered a sulcus), and dimple (locations
where a hump indicates a dimple of the CGS).
Second, this analysis consisted in identifying all sulci in the medial frontal
cortex, all anatomical landmarks fixed across species (rostral limit of the pons, anterior
commissure, caudal and rostral limit of the genu of the corpus callosum, apex of the
genu of the corpus callosum) and in identifying any relationships that may exist
between the location of a given sulcus and a given anatomical landmark in all species.
The relationships between the location of a given sulcus and a given anatomical
landmark in all species was performed as follow:
a) To assess whether PACS, PRPACS, VPCGS-P, and VPCGS-A were located at the
level of, respectively, the most rostral limit of the pons (landmark 1), the anterior
commissure (landmark 2), the caudal (landmark 3) and the rostral (landmark 4) limit

of the genu of the corpus callosum, we calculated the difference between the Y value
of the intersection between the CGS or the PCGS (if present) and the PACS, PRPACS,
VPCGS-P, and VPCGS-A and the Y value of landmarks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This
difference was calculated in all species on the normalized T1 data of the four species.
This difference was then normalized to take into account the different anteroposterior extent of the brains of the four species (i.e. antero-posterior extent of the
human, chimpanzee, baboon, and macaque brains are respectively 175, 110, 85 and
60 mm).
b) To assess the relative location of the intersection of the fork formed by SUROS/CGS-VE and SOS/CGS-DE with the CGS or PCGS across primates, we calculated the
% of displacement of this intersection from the apex of the genu of the corpus
callosum. In that goal, we measured the difference between the Z value of this
intersection and the Z value of the apex of the genu of the corpus callosum. To
compare primate brains, this difference was then normalized on the basis of the dorsoventral extent of the brains normalized in their respective standard space (see
Methods) at the level of the genu of the corpus callous across primates (i.e. 100, 50,
30, and 24mm, respectively in human, chimpanzee, baboon, and macaque brains).
Statistical analysis.
Concerning binomial data, we built binomial logistic regression GLMs. ANOVA Chi-square tests
and post-hoc Tukey tests were then applied. Note that, in the cases where only one value was
observed in a specific variable (e.g. the PCGS is absent in baboon and macaque and the
“presence” value is therefore 0 for all subjects), the binomial logistic regression GLM was
fitted using an adjusted-score approach to bias reduction (using the brglm package

(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brglm/brglm.pdf).
Concerning gaussian data (e.g. displacement of the fork formed by SU-ROS/CGS-VE and
SOS/CGS-DE), regular GLM analyses, ANOVA F tests, and Post-hoc Tukey tests were applied to
assess whether the location of the various sulci. All statistics were performed with R software,
