Abstract

30

Background: Distribution of N-acetyltransferase2 (NAT2) polymorphisms varies considerably

31

among different ethnic groups. Information on NAT2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in South

32

African population is limited. We investigated NAT2 polymorphisms and their effect on

33

isoniazid pharmacokinetics in Zulu black HIV-infected South Africans in Durban, South Africa.

34

Methods: HIV-infected participants with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were

35

enrolled from two unrelated studies. Culture-confirmed participants were genotyped for NAT2

36

polymorphisms 282C>T, 341T>C, 481C>T, 857G>A, 590G>A and 803A>G using Life Technologies

37

pre-validated Taqman assays (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Participants underwent sampling

38

for determination of plasma isoniazid and N-acetylisoniazid concentrations.

39

Results: Amongst the 120 patients, 63/120 (52.5%) were slow metabolisers (NAT2*5/*5),

40

43/120 (35.8%) had intermediate (NAT2*5/12), and 12/120 (11.7%) had rapid genotype

41

(NAT2*4/*11, NAT2*11/12 and NAT2*12/12). NAT2 alleles in this study were *4, *5C, *5D, *5E,

42

*5J, *5K, *5KA, *5T, *11A, *12A/12C and *12M. NAT2*5 was the most frequent allele (70.4%)

43

followed by NAT2*12 (27.9%). 34/40 had both PK results and NAT2 genotyping results. The

44

median area under the concentration-time-curve to infinity (AUC0-∞) interquartile range (IQR)

45

was 7.81 (5.87 – 16.83) µg/ml/hr and maximum concentration (Cmax) 3.14 µg/ml (2.42 – 4.36)

46

µg/mL. Individual polymorphisms were not equally distributed, with some represented in small

47

numbers. Genotype did not correlate with phenotype, rapid genotype showing higher AUC0-∞

48

than slow but not significant, p=0.43.

49

Conclusion: There was high prevalence of slow followed by intermediate then rapid acetylator

50

genotypes. The poor concordance between genotype and phenotype suggests that other

51

factors or genetic loci influence INH metabolism, and warrants further investigation in this

52

population.

Introduction:

55

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, with approximately

56

10 million cases and 1.5 million deaths in 2018 (1). South Africa is a high TB burden country

57

with an estimated 301,000 cases in 2018. The so-called ‘short-course’ treatment regimen

58

recommended in international guidelines; consisting of 6 months of rifampicin and isoniazid,

59

supplemented by pyrazinamide and ethambutol in the first 2 months, has remained largely

60

unchanged for several decades. Whilst this regimen can achieve high relapse-free cure rates, a

61

range of host and mycobacterial factors can influence treatment outcomes. There is increasing

62

evidence that inter-individual variability in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs within this

63

regimen lead to heterogeneity in clinical outcomes(2, 3).

64
65

Pharmacogenomics describes one cause of PK variability due to polymorphisms in drug

66

metabolising enzymes and transporters. During TB treatment, isoniazid is the paradigmatic

67

case. Isoniazid is acetylated to its major metabolite, N-acetyl-isoniazid (AcINH), by the action of

68

hepatic N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2). AcINH is subsequently rapidly hydrolysed to acetyl-

69

hydrazine, which is also acetylated, to diacetyl-hydrazine, by the action of NAT2(4).

70

Accumulated acetyl-hydrazine can be oxidised to form other, potentially hepatotoxic

71

metabolites(4-6). Moreover, accumulated isoniazid can be metabolised by an alternative

72

pathway where it is first hydrolysed to hydrazine, which has also been implicated in liver injury,

73

before acetylation to acetyl-hydrazine, again by NAT2(4, 7). Hence, the activity of NAT2 both

74

dictates metabolism of isoniazid, and determines the availability of potentially hepatoxic

75

hydrazine and acetyl-hydrazine metabolites. Within the 870-base pair NAT2 gene, a number of

76

low-activity single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been characterised. The NAT2

77

genotype has been shown to determine the rate of acetylation by NAT2 in several

78

populations(8). Individuals homozygous for the wild-type alleles are characterised as ‘rapid’

79

acetylators (RAs), those homozygous for low-activity SNPs as ‘slow’ acetylators (SAs) and

80

heterozygotes as ‘intermediate’ acetylators (IAs)(9-13). SAs have a higher incidence of side-

81

effects, particularly drug-induced hepatitis, during TB therapy, presumably due to higher levels

82

of hepatoxic metabolites (14-20). Amongst the first-line TB drugs isoniazid has the greatest

83

early bactericidal activity (EBA) and isoniazid PK parameters have been associated with rates of

84

cure, sterilisation and acquired drug resistance(3, 21-27). A link between rapid acetylation and

85

increased risk of poor treatment outcomes has been reported (28, 29).

86
87

NAT2 genotype is known to differ amongst ethnic groups; with approximately 40-70% of

88

Caucasians, Indians and African Americans characterised as SAs, versus only around 10% of

89

Asian populations(30-42). NAT2 genotype is not well characterised in the communities where

90

TB is most prevalent, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa has several black ethnic

91

groups and few have been studied(43-45). Bach et al characterised 40% of a Zulu population as

92

phenotypically slow acetylators but these findings have not been replicated, or informed by

93

genotypic analysis(44). Moreover, South Africa has a high HIV prevalence and discordant

94

relationships between NAT2 genotype and isoniazid acetylator phenotype have been described

95

amongst individuals living with HIV in other settings(46, 47).

96
97

We therefore characterised the relationship between NAT2 genotype, isoniazid and AcINH PK

98

and hepatotoxicity in a cohort of TB-HIV coinfected individuals in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South

99

Africa.

Methods:

103

Participants, study treatment and sample collection

104

Participants from two unrelated PK studies were included(48, 49). Both studies recruited black,

105

Zulu-speaking adults living with HIV from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, between March 2007

106

and April 2010. Study 1 entitled “Bioavailability of the fixed dose formulation Rifafour

107

containing isoniazid, rifampicin pyrazinamide, ethambutol and the WHO recommended first

108

line anti-retroviral drugs zidovudine, lamivudine, efavirenz administered to new TB patients at

109

different levels of immunosuppression.”. The results of this study have been previously

110

reported (49). As shown in Table 2, for the purposes of this analysis, we used samples collected

111

on day 1 of the study after an overnight fast, at pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 hours post

112

dose, with samples analysed for INH and AcINH for 60 participants with microbiologically

113

proven pulmonary TB (positive sputum culture or smear) who received a standard first line TB

114

regimen consisting of a FDC as described above . The INH dose was 150 mg, 225 mg, 300 mg

115

and 375 mg per day for participants with weight 30 -37 kg, 38– 54 kg, 55 – 70 kg, and 70 kg and

116

above, respectively, as per WHO guidelines(50). Each participant had blood collected on a

117

paxgene tube for NAT2 genotyping. In addition, genotyping was performed on a further 20

118

participants without TB who were recruited to this study (49).

119
120

Study 2, entitled “Pharmacokinetics of Rifabutin Combined with Antiretroviral Therapy in the

121

Treatment of Tuberculosis Patients with HIV Infection in South Africa”, was a randomised

122

controlled trial of two different rifabutin doses co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir-based

123

antiretroviral therapy (51, 52). Participants initially received 6 weeks of standard intensive

124

phase treatment, followed by 2 weeks with rifabutin 300mg daily replacing rifampicin. After 2

125

weeks of the continuation phase during which participants received only isoniazid and rifabutin

126

(both 300mg daily) PK sampling was carried out. Individuals were fasted overnight, and a

127

standard hospital breakfast served 2 hours after drug ingestion. Sampling was conducted pre-

128

dose and at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 and 24 hours after drug intake, with samples analysed for

129

isoniazid and AcINH for 40 participants. NAT2 genotyping was performed on 40 participants

130

with 34 participants having both PK sampling and genotyping.

131
132

All participants receiving anti-TB treatment in both studies were given pyridoxine for peripheral

133

neuropathy prophylaxis and patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3 received

134

cotrimoxazole. No participants were on antiretrovirals at the time of PK sampling. Both studies

135

were approved by the South African Medicines Control Council (SAMCC), Biomedical Research

136

Ethics Committee (BREC) of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (Study 1- E294/05; Study 2-

137

BFC011/07) and the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) ethics committee. Study

138

one was also approved by the WHO Ethics Research Ethics Committee. Written informed

139

consent was obtained from all participants.

141

NAT2 genotype procedures

142

Total Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen,

143

Crawly, UK) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Participants were genotyped, using the

144

DNA Engine Chromo4 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and Opticon Monitor v.3.1

145

software (Bio-Rad Laboratories), for 6 NAT2 SNPs; 282C>T, 341T>C, 481C>T, 857G>A, 590G>A

146

and 803A>G using Life Technologies pre-validated probe-based Taqman assays as per

147

manufactures instructions (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Each participant sample was

148

analysed in duplicate.

149
150

Haplotype assignment and acetylator genotype inference

151

Haplotype assignment from probe-based SNP data is poorly described in African populations.

152

We elected to employ an unbiased PHASE analysis, which takes the dataset as a whole to assign

153

the most likely haplotype for each individual, alongside a probability for this assignment (53,

154

54). Haplotype for each individual and acetylator genotype for each haplotype were defined as

155

per the NAT gene nomenclature committee (55). Individuals with two rapid alleles were defined

156

as RAs, those with two slow alleles as SAs and those with one fast and one slow allele as IAs.

157
158

Isoniazid and N-acetyl-isoniazid PK and phenotype inference

159

Blood samples were collected and placed on ice immediately, before centrifugation within 60

160

minutes, immediate separation and storage of plasma at -70°C until analysis. Concentrations of

161

isoniazid, AcINH and a 6-aminonicotinic acid internal control were quantified using validated

162

high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).

163

Sample preparation included a protein precipitation with acetonitrile and subsequent dilution

164

with water. Analytes were chromatographically separated using a Waters Exterra C18, 3.5µm,

165

50mm x 2.1mm column and detected using the AB Sciex 5500 Q-Trap mass spectrometer. All

166

analytes were analysed isocratically with an acetonitrile/water/0.1% formic acid mobile phase.

167

Isoniazid, AcINH and the internal standard were analysed at mass transitions of the precursor

168

ions (m/z) 137.9, 180.1 and 138.7 to the product ions (m/z) 66.0, 78.6 and 50.9, respectively.

169

Chromatographic data acquisition, peak integration and quantification of analytes was

170

performed using Analyst® software version 1.5.2. We constructed time-concentration curves in

171

the PK package in R for windows (version 3.5.1). We characterised the isoniazid and AcINH PK

172

parameters maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), area under

173

the concentration curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-∞), apparent oral clearance (CL) and

174

elimination half-life and compared Cmax to published efficacy targets (56). AUC0-∞ was calculated

175

using the trapezoid rule, apparent oral clearance estimated by dose / AUC0-∞ and elimination

176

half-life by regression analysis of log10 concentrations of the terminal exponent of elimination.

177

We analysed the ratio of log10 AcINH to log10 isoniazid at two and four hours to assess

178

acetylation phenotype.

179
180

Sample processing and HPLC-MS was initially conducted in 2010 for Study 1. Samples remained

181

in storage and were later moved to a new storage facility before they were shipped to a

182

different laboratory for determination of isoniazid and AcINH concentrations as above (having

183

previously only had isoniazid concentrations determined). To confirm the Integrity of these

184

samples we compared the isoniazid AUC0-∞ of the current analysis with that previously reported

185

on the same samples analysed in 2010.

186
187

Statistical methods

188

All data were entered in Epidata and transferred to either Stata (version 14) or R for windows

189

(version 3.5.1) for statistical analysis. Demographic characteristics were presented as

190

frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, and as means with standard deviations

191

for continuous variables. Descriptive PK data was described as median and inter-quartile

192

ranges. Cmax and AUC0-∞ were log-transformed prior to comparison between genotypes. PK

193

parameters were compared, by genotype, using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal–Wallis

194

test.

195
196

Hepatic adverse events

197

Hepatic adverse events were defined as elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and

198

aspartate transaminase (AST), elevated alkaline phosphatase and elevated total bilirubin,

Results:

203

Participant characteristics

204

One hundred and twenty-two individuals living with HIV participating in two PK studies were

205

included in the study. Eighty participants in study 1 were included in the NAT2 genotyping

206

analysis and 60 in the PK analysis (with 58 individuals having both PK and genotype data), while

207

40 participants in study 2 were included in the PK analysis and 40 participants included in NAT2

208

genotyping analysis (with 34 individuals having both PK and genotype data). Key characteristics

209

are outlined in table 1. Participants in study 1 included 60 with pulmonary TB and HIV co-

210

infection; 40 with CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 and, 20 with CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 as well as

211

20 participants living with HIV and without TB (who contributed only genotype data). All 40

212

participants in study 2 had TB and HIV coinfection, with a CD4 count of 200 cells/mm3 or below.

213

In the combined studies, 66.7% of participants had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3 and 33.3% had

214

CD4 count >200 cells/mm3. The Median age was 33.1 years (IQR 18-53). Only 15 (12.5%) of

215

patients had a BMI < 18.86 kg/m2.

216
217

NAT2 genotype and deduced phenotype

218

One hundred and twenty participants (80 from study 1 and 40 from study 2) were genotyped.

219

Allele and haplotype frequencies and deduced phenotypes are outlined in tables 2-5. We

220

identified 12 different alleles in the population. The most common allelic group was NAT2*5

221

(70.4%) followed by NAT2*12 (27.9%). From the NAT2*5 group NAT2*5C (21.3%), NAT2*5J

222

(17.5%), NAT2*5D (14.6%) and NAT2*5K (10.4%) were the most common. The NAT2*12 group

223

was predominantly NAT2*12C. The deduced phenotype was 11.7% rapid, 35.8% intermediate

224

and 52.5% slow.

227

As above, to assess sample integrity for Study 1 we compared the AUC0-∞ of the current analysis

228

with that previously reported on the same samples analysed in 2010. The median (IQR) AUC0-∞

229

was 5.53 (3.63 – 9.12), processed at University of Cape Town (UCT) in 2009 and 5.70 (3.85 –

230

7.94), processed at Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) laboratory in 2014, suggesting that

231

the integrity of the samples was maintained for isoniazid, but cannot be confirmed for AcINH.

232
233

Study 1 showed rapid absorption, with a median (IQR) isoniazid Tmax of 1 hr(1 -2). Isoniazid

234

exposure was variable amongst individuals with median (IQR) Cmax 1.47 (1.14 – 1.85) µg/ml and

235

AUC0-∞ 5.53 (3.63 – 9.12) µg.h/ml. Median (IQR) elimination half-life was relatively slow at 2.27

236

(1.69 – 3.56) h. We compared these isoniazid PK measures to published targets; 98.28% (57/58)

237

failed to attain the minimum 2-hour plasma concentration target of 3 µg/ml (56). PK

238

parameters by genotype are shown in table 8(A), unexpectedly median half-life was slowest,

239

apparent oral clearance lowest and AUC0-∞ highest amongst genotypically rapid acetylators,

240

with the reverse true for genotypically slow acetylators, although none of these differences was

241

statistically significant. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences by genotype

242

for AcINH Cmax, elimination half-life or AUC0-∞. Median isoniazid and AcINH time-concentration

243

curves are given in Figure 1(A).

244
245

Absorption was rapid in Study 2, with a median INH Tmax of 2 hrs. INH exposure was also

246

variable amongst individuals with median (IQR) Cmax 3.14 µg/ml (2.39 – 4.34) and AUC0-∞ 10.76

247

µg.hr/ml (8.24 – 28.96 µg/ml). Median elimination half-life was 2.62hr (2.26 – 4.07). Again, we

248

compared these INH PK measures to published PK targets; 47.5% (19/40) failed to attain the

249

minimum 2-hour plasma concentration target of 3 µg/ml. PK parameters by genotype are

250

shown in table 8(B). For both isoniazid and AcINH and across the PK parameters; Cmax, AUC0-∞

251

and elimination half-life, variability (both range and IQR) were increased amongst those

252

genotyped as SAs. Again however, there were no statistically significant differences between

253

these PK parameters by genotype. Median isoniazid and AcINH time-concentration curves are

254

given in Figure 1(B).

256

For both studies we calculated the log10 AcINH: log10 isoniazid ratio, as a measure of

257

acetylation, at two and four hours post-dose and analysed this ratio by genotype (figure2 & 3).

258

In both studies we saw no statistically significant difference in ratios between genotypes at

259

either two or four hours. In Study 2 we again saw increased variability in this metric amongst

260

those genotyped as SAs.

261
262

Hepatic adverse events

263

There were no grade 3 and 4 hepatic adverse events in Study 1 and only 1 grade 4 hepatic

264

event was reported from the only participant with rapid genotype in Study 2. Although there

265

were more grade 1 hepatic adverse events among the slow genotype participants, as shown in

266

table 9, the difference was not statistically significant between genotypes; p=0.203 in Study 1,

267

and 0.276 in Study 2.

268
269

Discussion:

270

We investigated the NAT2 genotype, isoniazid and AcINH PK of black Zulu South Africans living

271

with HIV from Durban and surrounding areas. We found that most individuals were of SA

272

(52.5%) or IA (35.8%) genotype, with only a small number of RA genotype (11.7%). The

273

proportions of the deduced acetylator phenotypes in our population was broadly similar to

274

other African and Caucasian populations (36, 43, 57, 58) but differed from those previously

275

reported from within other black ethnic groups within Southern Africa. For example, Werely et

276

al found that IA genotypes dominated in the Xhosa cohort, with SAs only 30% (45). Our results

277

were comparable to a recent Study by Naidoo et al. in patients from the same geographic area

278

reported 34% SA, 43% IA and 18% RA (59).

279
280

There was a high prevalence of the NAT2*5 allelic group in our population, accounting for the

slow acetylator genotype. In well studied Caucasian and Asian populations, four variants;

282

NAT2*4 (wild type, rapid), NAT2*5B, NAT2*6A, and NAT2*7B (all slow), account for most NAT2

283

alleles. In Asian populations there are generally a higher proportion of wild type NAT2*4 alleles

284

and few NAT2*5B alleles, and this difference largely accounts for the much lower prevalence of

285

RAs in non-Asian populations. Consistent with other studies in Sub-Saharan African populations,

286

the wild-type NAT*4 allele was far less prevalent and variant alleles were far more diverse in

287

our Study. In our population, the NAT2*5B allele was relatively rare in comparison to two

288

studies in the black population from Western Cape and North West Province. (45, 60).

289

However, in contrast to these populations, there were a diversity of other NAT2*5 alleles,

290

including a much higher prevalence of the rare NAT2*5J allele (17.5%) and the poorly

291

characterised NAT2*5K allele (10.4%). The NAT2*6A and NAT2*7B alleles, common in

292

Caucasian and Asian populations, were not seen in our cohort. In Caucasian and Asian

293

populations, rapid NAT2*12 alleles are rarely seen, where as in populations in sub-Saharan

294

Africa the NAT2*12A allele is reported at much higher frequencies(35). In our Study the

295

NAT2*12A allele did indeed comprise 5.8% of alleles seen but we saw a much higher frequency

296

of the NAT2*12C allele (21.2%), in contrast to other Southern African cohorts(10, 45, 60, 61).

297
298

Isoniazid Cmax and AUC0-∞ demonstrated considerable variability between individuals in both

299

studies and almost all participants in Study 1 and almost half of the participants in Study 2 had a

300

Cmax below the lower limit of the target range(56). Low isoniazid concentrations during TB

301

treatment are concerning because it is postulated they may lead to poorer treatment

302

outcomes, or the generation of isoniazid resistance, the likely first step in the evolution of

303

multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB). However, the evidence for either of these concerns is mixed

304

and in this setting the prevalence of INH mono-resistance is relatively low.

305
306

There was a marked difference in PK measures between the two studies analysed, with Study 1

307

having much lower measures than Study 2.

308

contributed to this difference. The difference in isoniazid dosing could explain the lower PK

309

measures, where Study 1 used the FDC dosing as per WHO recommended weight bands,

310

leading to almost half the participants receiving doses <300 mg, as previously reported(49). All

311

participants in Study 2 received 300 mg doses of isoniazid irrespective of weight. Although the

312

samples of Study 1 did not appear to deteriorate during the 5 years between first analysis and

313

subsequent analyses for this study, differences in processing and storage between the studies
11

There are several reasons that could have

314

cannot be excluded. Figure 3 shows the INH and AcINH at different time points. Based on this,

315

the phenotype of the study participants is generally more intermediate/rapid than what the

316

predominant slow genotype suggests, which is in contrast to other studies reporting HIV

317

patients having a tendency towards slow phenotype (62).

318
319

We identified no statistically significant difference by NAT2 genotype in a variety of PK

320

measures, hence in this cohort we found poor correlation between NAT2 genotype and

321

phenotypic acetylation of isoniazid. Previous studies in other populations have shown good

322

correlation between NAT2 genotype and isoniazid PK, suggesting that NAT2 genotyping could

323

be used as a parsimonious way to risk-stratify patients and personalise dosing of isoniazid in an

324

attempt to maximise efficacy whilst minimising toxicity. There are significant practical

325

difficulties to implementing these approaches in this setting, but our data suggest that in this

326

population NAT2 genotyping will not be helpful in guiding TB therapy. A lack of concordance

327

between genotypic and phenotypic measures of INH acetylation has been reported previously

328

in HIV positive cohorts (63) (64). It is likely that in this cohort, as in others, other non-genetic

329

factors are more or equally important than NAT2 genotype. Jones et al found that infection

330

with HIV or stage of HIV infection may alter Phase I and II drug metabolising enzyme (DME)

331

activity in their study on 17 HIV infected participants at different levels of immunosuppression

332

(65). They found that HIV infection was related to an increase in variability of these DMEs.

333

Whilst additional pathways, aside from NAT2 genotype, have been implicated in hepatotoxicity

334

of isoniazid-containing TB treatment regimens, it is not clear that these pathways alter isoniazid

335

PK and thus could account for the lack of genotypic and phenotypic concordance in this study.

336
337

Although there were more hepatic adverse events among the SA, there was no statistical

338

association between genotype and hepatotoxicity in the two studies, with only 1 patient who

339

was a RA having a grade 4 hepatic adverse event and 2 others who were IA having grade 3

340

hepatic adverse events.

342

In our study, participants received pyridoxine and cotrimoxazole with the ATT in Study 2, but

343

not in Study 1 as we used the samples collected on day 1 for this analysis when only ATT was

344

given. As both INH and sulfamethoxazole are inhibitors of CYP2C9, this could be one of the

345

reasons for the variations noted. INH also inhibits CYP3A4, which is induced by rifampicin, this

346

interaction has not proven significant except when it relates to hepatotoxicity (66, 67). That the

347

combination of INH and rifampicin leads to an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, has been

348

reported in other studies. In our Study 2, isoniazid was given with Rifabutin which is a less

349

potent hepatic enzyme inducer, which therefore should have less interaction with INH (68).

350

Considering the limited effect on hepatotoxicity, the effect of CYP2E1 was not evident in our

351

study. We cannot confirm or exclude the effect of these CYP450 enzymes on INH metabolism in

352

these participants.

353
354

In our study samples were stored at -800 Celsius and loss of compound due to storage would

355

have been minimal (69), although studies have not reported on plasma samples stored longer

356

than 5 weeks, nor sample integrity for the metabolite, AcINH.

357
358

Conclusion

359

Amongst black Zulu TB-HIV coinfected South African patients, most had slow or intermediate

360

NAT2 genotype. There was a diversity of specific NAT2 alleles of a pattern differing from

361

previously studied cohorts in other settings. Despite the rarity of rapid acetylator genotypes,

362

INH PK was variable and a substantial proportion of individuals failed to attain minimum

363

efficacy targets. Importantly NAT2 genotype did not explain PK variability in this cohort or the

364

low Cmax, which suggests that other factors could be influencing isoniazid bioavailability and

365

metabolism, which require further elucidation.
