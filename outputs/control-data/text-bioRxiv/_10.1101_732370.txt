Abstract
Mechanical force has emerged as a determinant of Notch signalling but the mechanisms of force sensing
and coupling to Notch are unclear. Here we propose a role for Piezo1 channels, the recently identified
mechanosensors of mammalian systems. Piezo1 channel opening in response to shear stress or a
chemical agonist led to activation of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10
(ADAM10), a Ca2+-regulated transmembrane sheddase that mediates S2 Notch1 cleavage. Consistent
with this observation there was increased Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) that depended on
ADAM10 and the downstream S3 cleavage enzyme, -secretase. Endothelial-specific disruption of
Piezo1 in mice led to decreased Notch1-regulated gene expression in hepatic vasculature, consistent
with prior evidence that Notch1 controls hepatic perfusion. The data suggest Piezo1 as a mechanism
for coupling physiological force at the endothelium to ADAM10, Notch1, gene expression and vascular
function.

Introduction
Mammalian Notch proteins were identified following studies in D. melanogaster that linked genetic
abnormality to wing notch1. Extensive research then revealed major roles in the transfer of information
between cells in health and disease1. Each of the four Notch receptors (Notch1-4) is a membrane protein
that is trans coupled to a membrane-anchored ligand such as Deltalike 4 (DLL4). Though the initiation
of Notch signalling is often considered to occur through ligand-receptor complex formation, mechanical
force also plays an important role in this activation whereby a pulling force arising from ligand
endocytosis causes trans activation1,2. Furthermore it recently became apparent that frictional force from
fluid flow also stimulates Notch1, but how this force couples to the Notch mechanism is unknown3-6.
Therefore mechanical forces would seem to play key roles in Notch regulation. Further information is
needed on how this is achieved.
Piezo1 channels are key players in the sensing of shear stress and lateral force applied to plasma
membranes (membrane tension)7-14. While there are multiple candidate sensors, Piezo1 channels are
notable because of broad agreement amongst investigators that they are direct sensors of physiological
force. As such they are now considered to be bona fide force sensors rather than proteins that, whilst
affected by force, do not appear to have evolved to sense and transduce force as a primary function.
Piezo1 channels are exquisitely sensitive to membrane tension15 and readily able to confer force-sensing
capacity on cells that are otherwise poorly sensitive7,9. Reconstitution of Piezo1 channels in artificial
lipid bilayers generates force-sensing channels16 and native Piezo1 channels in excised membrane
patches respond robustly to mechanical force in the absence of intracellular factors10.
Piezo1 channels are Ca2+-permeable non-selective cationic channels, so when force causes them to open
there is Ca2+ entry, elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and regulation of Ca2+-dependent
mechanisms7,8. Potentially relevant to such a system is Ca2+ and Ca2+-calmodulin regulation of
ADAM1017,18, a metalloprotease or sheddase that catalyses rate-limiting S2 cleavage of Notch1 prior to
-secretase-mediated S3 cleavage and release of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), driving
downstream transcription1,19,20. Therefore, we speculated about a potential relationship between Piezo1
and Notch1, using endothelial cells to investigate this idea because both proteins are prominent in these
cells and have established functional significance in them1,8-10,12,19. Because mechanical force can affect
numerous mechanisms, we explored the relationship by specifically activating Piezo1 channels with a
synthetic small-molecule agonist (Yoda1) that acts directly to enhance force sensitivity21-24. Because
there is inherent force in cell membranes and force arises through cell-cell and cell-substrate contact,
Yoda1 can be used to activate the channels in endothelial cells without applying an exogenous force24
that might otherwise complicate the analysis by concurrently stimulating parallel mechanisms. Piezo1
dependence of Yoda1’s actions was investigated and the effect of fluid flow was also determined.

Results
Piezo1 regulates NICD abundance. To activate Piezo1 channels without stimulating other forcesensing mechanisms we applied 0.2 M Yoda1, the concentration required for half-maximal activation
of native endothelial Piezo1 channels24. After 30-min Yoda1 treatment, human microvascular
endothelial cells (HMVEC-Cs) showed 1.5-2 times as much NICD as controls (Figure 1a-d). Short
interfering (si) RNA specific to Piezo1 (Supplementary Figure S1) reduced basal NICD to about half
its control value and the Yoda1 effect was suppressed (Figure 1b). The data are consistent with the
reported ability of shear stress to increase NICD4 and suggest importance of Piezo1 for basal Notch1
processing and ability of Yoda1 to stimulate production of NICD.
-secretase is required. If Piezo1 channels do indeed promote NICD release, the effect should depend
on -secretase1. Therefore we tested the role of -secretase by treating cells with 10 M DAPT (N-[N-

(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butylester), a commonly used -secretase
inhibitor4,25. DAPT had an effect on NICD that was similar to that of Piezo1 siRNA, reducing basal
NICD and ablating the ability of Yoda1 to increase NICD (Figure 1c, d). DAPT inhibited Yoda1-evoked
Ca2+ entry by about 30%, which was unlikely to have been sufficient to explain its effect on NICD
(Supplementary Figure S1). The data suggest that Piezo1-mediated and constitutively generated NICD
require -secretase.

ADAM10 is important. In order to understand how Piezo1 channels couple to Notch1 we next
considered the role of ADAM10, which is required for S2 cleavage before -secretase can act 1. SiRNA
targeted to ADAM10 (Supplementary Figure S2) had an effect on NICD that was remarkably similar
to that of Piezo1 siRNA and DAPT (Figure 2a, b cf Figure 1). It tended to reduce basal NICD, and
Yoda1 no longer had significant effect (Figure 2b). The data suggest that ADAM10 is required for
effects of Piezo1 on NICD.

0.001.

ADAM10 enzyme activity is needed. To investigate if ADAM10 activity mediates the effect of Yoda1,
we first quantified the abundance of its cleaved form, a 62-64 kDa protein that is generated by
proprotein convertase to enable enzymatic activity20. In HMVEC-Cs, the majority of ADAM10 was in
the uncleaved form, a protein of 95 kDa that is inactive (Figure 2c, Supplementary Figure S2). Yoda1
increased the abundance of the cleaved form, but the quantity remained small relative to the total protein
(Figure 2c, d). To investigate if the ADAM10 was enzymatically active 18 we used a cell-based activity
assay. Yoda1 increased ADAM10 activity (Figure 2e). The effect was prevented by the widely used
ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X ((2R,3S)-3-(Formyl-hydroxyamino)-2-(3-phenyl-1-propyl) butanoic
acid[(1S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-methylcarbamoyl-1-propyl] amide) which is thought to act via the catalytic
site26 (Figure 2e). GI254023X (5 M) affected NICD similarly to Piezo1 siRNA and ADAM10 siRNA,

reducing both basal NICD and the ability of Yoda1 to increase NICD (Figure 2f, g). A 10-fold lower
concentration of GI254023X (500 nM) inhibited the Yoda1 effect on NICD (Supplementary Figure S2),
consistent with its nanomolar potency against ADAM1026. GI254023X (5 M) had no effect on Yoda1evoked Ca2+ entry (Supplementary Figure S2). Gd3+ (30 M), a blocker of the Piezo1 channel pore7,
inhibited the ability of Yoda1 to activate ADAM10, consistent with Ca2+ entry through the channel
being required (Supplementary Figure S2). The data suggest that Piezo1-mediated stimulation of
ADAM10 enzyme activity is necessary for basal and stimulated effects on Notch1 cleavage.
Shear stress activates ADAM10, via Piezo1. To further investigate ADAM10, we applied 10 dyn.cm2
laminar shear stress, a physiological stimulator of Piezo1 channels9. In response to this stimulus there
was also increased ADAM10 enzymatic activity, which was Piezo1-dependent (Figure 2h). The data
suggest that shear stress acts, like Yoda1, to stimulate ADAM10 via Piezo1 channels.
Function significance for downstream gene expression. To investigate if there is functional
significance of Piezo1-regulated NICD, we quantified Notch1-regulated gene expression, focussing on
the HES1 gene which is Notch1- and flow- regulated4 and DLL4, which is itself Notch1 regulated27.
Yoda1 caused increased expression of both HES1 and DLL4 genes (Figure 3), consistent with Yoda1’s
effect on NICD (Figure 1). The effects of Yoda1 were suppressed by Piezo1 siRNA (Figure 3a, b),
DAPT (Figure 3c, d), ADAM10 siRNA (Figure 3e, f) and GI254023X (Figure 3g, h). In most cases,
there was little or no change in constitutive gene expression, suggesting that it is regulated mostly by
other mechanisms in these cultured cells (HMVEC-Cs). Nevertheless, the data suggest that Piezo1
signalling via Notch1 can be functionally important for downstream gene regulation.

Importance for hepatic vasculature gene regulation. To test the physiological relevance, we
investigated liver where functional microvascular Piezo1 channels have been detected at the adult
stage10 and where Notch1 is important for sinusoid development19,28. To specifically ask about
endothelial biology, liver endothelial cells were acutely isolated after 2-weeks in vivo conditional
Piezo1 disruption in endothelium of adult mice (Piezo1EC), as previously described10. Neither mice nor
isolated cells received Yoda1, so Piezo1 channel activity should have arisen only due to physiological
forces existing in vivo prior to cell isolation. Strikingly, expression of Hes1 and Dll4 genes was
downregulated in Piezo1EC endothelial cells (Figure 4a, b) (Supplementary Figure S3). Hey1 and
EphrinB2, other genes known to be Notch1- and flow-regulated4,6, were also downregulated (Figure 4c,
d). Expression of the reference gene, -actin, and endothelial marker gene, Tie2, was not affected
(Supplementary Figure S3).Whole liver showed no change or trends towards decreased expression of
Hes1, Dll4, Hey1 and Ephrin B2 in Piezo1EC mice, consistent with effects restricted to the endothelial
cell population (Supplementary Figure S4). The data suggest that endothelial Piezo1 normally
positively regulates Notch1 signalling in hepatic vasculature.

different between Control and Piezo1EC (Supplementary Figure S3). t-Test was used, indicating significant difference of
Piezo1EC cf Control * P< 0.05, ** P< 0.01.

Discussion
The study has identified a connection between Piezo1 channels and Notch1 signalling and thus a
mechanism by which Notch1 regulation by force can be achieved. We propose a pathway in which
activation of Piezo1 channels stimulates ADAM10 via Ca2+ and Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated
mechanisms17,18 for S2 cleavage of Notch1, which then enables intracellular S3 cleavage by -secretase
and release of NICD for association with transcriptional regulators such as RBPJ and the control of
gene expression (Figure 5). In this way, Notch1 is coupled to an exceptional force sensor, the Piezo1
channel. Other mechanisms by which Notch1 achieves force sensitivity are not excluded but we suggest
that Piezo1 is a mechanism of biological significance because endothelial-specific disruption of Piezo1
in vivo disturbed Notch1-regulated gene expression in hepatic endothelium, a site known to be Notchregulated. Our findings are consistent with prior studies of D melanogaster that inferred Notch to be
downstream of Piezo 29 and so the proposed mechanism may have broad relevance.

Figure 5: Summary of the proposed pathway. Activation of Piezo1 channel by mechanical force (e.g. fluid flow) or chemical
agonist (Yoda1) causes elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration which stimulates enzymatic activity of ADAM10 to
cause S2 and S3 Notch1 cleavage and release of NICD to drive gene expression that is important in hepatic vasculature and
potentially other vascular biology.

Prior work showed important effects of endothelial-specific disruption of Notch1-regulated RBPJ on
hepatic microvasculature19,28. Disruption of RBPJ in 6 week-old mice led to enlarged sinusoids between
portal and central venules, and disruption earlier in postnatal development caused poor perfusion,
hypoxia and liver necrosis28. Therefore our observed requirement for Piezo1 in Notch1-regulated gene
expression of hepatic endothelial cells suggests a positive role for the proposed Piezo1ADAM10/Notch1 partnership in hepatic function. It is important to emphasise that Piezo1 signalling is
unlikely to be limited to ADAM10/Notch1 because there is also good evidence for Piezo1 coupling to
calpain9, eNOS9,14 and other mechanisms30. Therefore, it will be challenging to delineate the specific in
vivo phenotypic contribution of Piezo1 coupling to ADAM10/Notch1 relative to other downstream
consequences of activated Piezo1 channels.
An important observation of ours was that shear stress activates ADAM10 via Piezo1 (Figure 2h). It is
consistent with previous work describing activation of ADAM10 by shear stress in human platelets 31,
which also express Piezo132. The finding has implications for Notch1 signalling but also more widely
because ADAM10 is a sheddase that also targets E- and VE-cadherin, CD44 and cellular prion
protein17,33-35. Therefore its shear stress regulation via Piezo1 may be broadly relevant, for example in
adherens junction biology and cartilage integrity, where functional importance of Piezo1 is already
suggested36,37, and amyloid plaque formation, where Piezo1 was originally detected38 and has been
suggested to have functional importance in combination with E coli infection39.
A prior report has suggested lack of specificity of Yoda1 for Piezo1 channels40 but the GsMTx4 toxin
used as the basis of this proposal has limited value as a tool for evaluating Piezo1. Other prior studies
have shown that genetic deletion of Piezo1 abolishes Yoda1’s effects10,36,41,42 and that Piezo1
knockdown by RNA interference suppresses its effects14,30,43-46, consistent with Yoda1 having only
Piezo1-mediated effects. Specific structure-activity requirements of Yoda1 at Piezo1 have been
observed24 and it does not activate Piezo221. Here we observed that Piezo1-specific siRNA suppressed
or abolished Yoda1 effects. Although it is important to seek Piezo1-specific activation with agents such
as Yoda1 (because mechanical force is not specific to Piezo1) we recognise that activation by such
agents does not necessarily mimic activation by a physiological factor such as shear stress. Importantly,
therefore, we show that shear stress mimicked the effect of Yoda1 at ADAM10 and that genetic
disruption of Piezo1 impacted Notch1 signalling in the absence of Yoda1. Therefore Piezo1 regulation
of the ADAM10/Notch1 pathway was not dependent on Yoda1.

In conclusion, we connect the new discovery of Piezo1 mechanosensing with the extensive prior
discoveries of the ADAM and Notch fields1,19. The ability of Piezo1 to activate ADAM10 and Notch1
suggests that these mechanisms are downstream of Piezo1 and therefore linked via Piezo1 to changes
in physiological force. There are likely to be broad-ranging implications for vascular and other biology.
Understanding how to specifically disrupt the Piezo1-ADAM10/Notch1 partnership will be important
as a next step to deciphering the roles and therapeutic potential of the pathway.
Materials and Methods
Piezo1 mutant mice. All animal use was authorized by the University of Leeds Animal Ethics
Committee and Home Office UK. Genotypes were determined using real-time PCR with specific probes
designed for each gene (Transnetyx, Cordova, TN). C57BL/6 J mice with Piezo1 gene flanked with
LoxP sites (Piezo1flox) were described previously9. To generate tamoxifen (TAM) inducible disruption
of Piezo1 gene in the endothelium (Piezo1EC), Piezo1flox mice were crossed with mice expressing cre
recombinase under the Cadherin5 promoter (Tg(Cdh5-cre/ERT2)1Rha) and inbred to obtain
Piezo1flox/flox/Cdh5-cre mice. TAM (T5648, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO) was dissolved in corn oil
(C8267 Sigma-Aldrich) at 20 mg.ml−1. 10-12 week-old male mice were injected intra-peritoneal with
75 mg.kg-1 TAM for 5 consecutive days and studied 10-14 days later. Control mice were the same
except they lacked cre, so they could not disrupt Piezo1 even though they were also injected with TAM.
Acute isolation of liver endothelial cells. Liver of 12-14 week-old male mice was used. Tissue was
mechanically separated using forceps, further cut in smaller pieces and incubated at 37 °C for 50 min,
in a MACSMix Tube Rotator to provide continuous agitation, along with 0.1% Collagenase II (17101015, Gibco, Waltham, MA) and Dispase Solution (17105-041, Gibco). Following enzymatic digestion
samples were passed through 100 μm and 40 μm cell strainers to remove any undigested tissue. The
suspension was incubated for 15 min with dead cell removal paramagnetic beads (130-090-101,
Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and then passed through LS column (130-042401, Miltenyi Biotec). The cell suspension was incubated with CD146 magnetic beads (130-092-007,
Miltenyi Biotec 130-092-007) at 4°C for 15 min under continuous agitation and passed through MS
column (130-042-201, Miltenyi Biotec). The CD146 positive cells, retained in the MS column, were
plunge out with PEB and centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 min. Cell pellet was resuspended in RLT buffer
(74004, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to proceed with RNA isolation.
Cell culture. HMVEC-Cs were cultured in endothelial medium 2MV (EGM-2MV, CC-3202, Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sixteen hours before performing
experiments, cells were cultured with starvation medium consisting of EGM-2MV but only 0.5% fetal
bovine serum and without vascular endothelial growth factor A165 (VEGF A165) and basic fibroblast
growth factor.
siRNA transfection. HMVEC-Cs were transfected with siRNA using Opti-MEMTM I Reduced Serum
Medium (31985070, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Lipofectamine 2000 (11668019,
ThermoFisher Scientific). For transfection of cells in 6-well plates, a total of 50 nmol siRNA in 0.1 mL
was added to 0.8 mL cell culture medium per well. Medium was changed after 4 hours. After 48 hours
cells were treated or not with Yoda1 and subjected to RNA or protein isolation. For Ca2+ measurement,
cells were plated into a 96-well plate at a density of 25000 cells per well 24 hours after transfection,
and Ca2+ entry was recorded 24 hours later.
RNA isolation and RT-qPCR. For isolated liver endothelial cells, RNA was isolated by using RNeasy
micro-kit (74004, Qiagen). A total of 100 ng RNA per sample was subjected to Reverse Transcriptase
(RT) by using iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis kit (1708890, BioRad, Hercules, CA). For whole liver, RNA
was isolated using phenol/chloroform extraction from snap frozen samples. One g of RNA was used
for RT (Superscript® III Reverse Transcriptase, 18080044, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). qPCR was
performed using SyBR Green (1725122, Biorad). The sequences of PCR primers are shown in
Supplementary Table S1. Primers were synthetized by Sigma. qPCR reactions were performed on a
LightCycler® 480 Real Time PCR System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Samples were analysed using

the comparative CT method, where fold-change was calculated from the ΔΔCt values with the formula
2-ΔΔCt.
ADAM10 enzyme activity. Activity was determined using the SensoLyte®520 ADAM10 Activity
Assay Kit (AS-72226, AnaSpec Inc, Fremont, CA), which is based on the FRET substrate 5‐
FAM/QXL™520 with excitation/emission of 490/520 nm. HMVEC-Cs were treated with or without
Yoda1 for 30 min in the presence or absence of ADAM10 inhibitor. Cells were then washed with PBS
and collected with Trypsin-EDTA. The pellet was resuspended in assay buffer, incubated on ice for
10 min and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were plated on a 96‐well plate.
The substrate solution was diluted in Assay Buffer, brought to 37 °C was then mixed 1:1 with the
sample. The fluorescence was measured every 2.5 min for 60 min at 37 °C at excitation/emission of
490/520 nm Flexstation 3 microplate reader with SoftMax Pro 5.4.5 software (Molecular Devices, San
Josa, CA).
Shear stress. Endothelial cells were seeded on glass slides (MENSJ5800AMNZ, VWR, Radnor, PA)
coated with Fibronectin (F0895, Sigma-Aldrich). Sixteen hours before performing experiments, cells
were cultured with starvation medium consisting of EGM-2MV but only 0.5% fetal bovine serum and
without vascular endothelial growth factor A165 (VEGF A165) and basic fibroblast growth factor. The
slides were placed in a parallel flow chamber and flow of starvation medium was driven using a
peristaltic pump.
Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Cells plated in 96-well plates were
incubated for 1 hour in Standard Bath Solution (SBS, containing in mM: 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 8 D-glucose,
10 HEPES, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, pH 7.4) supplemented with 2 μM fura-2-AM (F1201, Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR) and 0.01 % pluronic acid. Cells were then washed in SBS at room temperature for
30 min, allowing deesterification to release free fura-2. Fluorescence (F) acquisition (excitation 340
and 380 nm; emission 510 nm) was performed on a Flexstation 3 microplate reader with SoftMax Pro
5.4.5 software (Molecular Devices). After 60 seconds of recording, Yoda1 was injected. Ca2+ entry was
quantified after normalization (ΔF340/380 = F340/380(t)-F340/380(t=0)).
Immunoblotting. Proteins were isolated in RIPA buffer supplemented with PMSF, protease inhibitor
mixture, and sodium orthovanadate (RIPA Lysis Buffer System, sc24948, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX).
Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, loaded on a precast 4-20 %
polyacrylamide gradient gel (4561094, Biorad) and subjected to electrophoresis. Proteins were
transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-Blot® TurboTM RTA Mini Nitrocellulose Transfer
Kit, 1704270, BioRad) for 30 min using Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (BioRad). Membranes were
blocked with 5 % milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 0.05 % for 1 hour at room temperature. The
membranes were exposed to primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, rinsed and incubated with appropriate
horseradish peroxidase-labelled secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. The detection was
performed by using SuperSignalTM West Femto (34096, ThermoFisher Scientific) and visualized with
a G-Box Chemi-XT4 (SynGene, Cambridge, UK). GAPDH was used as reference protein.
Reagents. Human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-C, CC-7030, Lonza), DAPT
(D5942, Sigma-Aldrich), GI254023X (3995, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), Yoda1 (5586/10, Tocris

Statistical Analysis. All averaged data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical
significance was determined using two-tailed t-test when only two groups were compared or by 2-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey posthoc test when multiple groups were treated with vehicle control
(DMSO) or Yoda1 were studied. The genotypes of mice were blinded to the experimental investigator
and studied at random according to Mendelian ratio. In all cases, statistical significance was assumed
for probability (P) <0.05. Statistical tests were performed using OriginPro 8.6 software or GraphPad
Prism 6.0. Outlying data were not detected or excluded. The letter n indicates the number of independent
biological experiments and its value in each case is stated in figure legends. The study was aimed at
discovering components of a biological mechanism using various cell/molecular and animal-based
studies to address a single hypothesis. In the absence of prior knowledge of the mechanism, power
calculations were not considered to be applicable. We selected numbers of independent repeats of
experiments base on prior experience of studies of this type. In all cases the number of independent
repeats was at least 3. The number of replicates per independent experiment was 1 for western blotting,
2 for qPCR, 4 for Ca2+ assays and 1 for the ADAM10 activity assay.
