The role of cellular metabolites in the direct control of signaling is an emerging and
rapidly evolving field. Herein, we identify a key role for nuclear glycogen in epigenetic
regulation through compartmentalized acetyl CoA production and histone acetylation.
Nuclear glycogenolysis is dependent on ubiquitination and translocation of glycogen
phosphorylase (GP) into the nucleus by malin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We developed an
innovative in organello stable isotope tracer method coupled to mass spectrometry
analysis to define the metabolic fate of nuclear glycogen. This work revealed that GP is
required for nuclear glycogen degradation and subsequent glycolysis to generate
substrates for histone acetylation. Inhibition of nuclear glycogenolysis is found to be
particularly important in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as evident by increased
nuclear glycogen accumulation and malin suppression in NSCLC. Re-introduction of
malin in model NSCLC cell lines restores nuclear glycogenolysis, resulting in increased
histone acetylation and transcriptional changes that delay cancer cell growth in vivo.
This study uncovers a previously unknown role for glycogen metabolism in the nucleus
and elucidates another way by which cellular metabolites control epigenetic regulation.

Glycogen is the primary source of storage carbohydrate in mammals and primarily
functions as an energy cache. Abnormal glycogen metabolism has deleterious effects in
a range of diseases including cancer1,2, neurodegeneration3 and congestive heart
failure4. However, glycogen also has other key roles beyond functioning as a simple
energy reserve. Nuclear glycogen was first reported in the 1950s in hepatocytes,
suggesting compartmentalized regulation, but its role in cellular physiology remained
unanswered5,6. This study investigates the half-century old phenomenon of nuclear
glycogen in the case of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We found increased
glycogen accumulation in the nucleus of NSCLC patient tumors and model cell lines
and defined its pivotal role in modulating histone acetylation.
We analyzed paired cancer and normal distal benign tissues from four NSCLC patients
and three NSCLC cell lines for glycogen content. A general increase in glycogen is
observed in cancer tissue and cell lines by histochemical imaging with an anti-glycogen
antibody and biochemical quantification (supplement Fig. 1 and 2A-B). Further analysis
of histochemical staining suggested the presence of nuclear glycogen in NSCLC
(supplement Fig. 2A). To quantify the presence of nuclear glycogen, we used a
hypotonic cell lysis buffer to isolate nuclear glycogen and measured the glycogen
content in both cancer and normal tissues and lung cancer cell lines. Nuclear glycogen
content ranged from 1-10mg/mg protein in both patient cancer tissues and cancer cell
lines (Fig. 1A and D), representing a 10-100-fold increase compared with benign tissue.
Nuclear glycogen accumulation is accompanied by the suppression of malin, an E3
ubiquitin ligase reported to interact with glycogen metabolic enzymes7,8. Using
OncoLnc9, which connects TCGA survival data with matching RNAseq analysis, we
found that high malin mRNA expression correlates with better survival, suggesting malin
is of clinical importance in NSCLC (Fig. 1B). Strikingly, this correlation was specific,
since it was not observed with other cancers, such as breast (supplement Fig. 2D),
prostate or ovarian cancers. Indeed, we observed a dramatic decrease in malin protein
levels in NSCLC patient samples by both immunoblotting (Fig. 1C), and histochemical
staining (supplement Fig. 1B).
Ubiquitination can impact protein levels by promoting proteasome-dependent
degradation, can change enzymatic activity, and/or can change the localization of a
protein10. Therefore, we hypothesized that downregulation of malin contributes to
nuclear glycogen accumulation by impacting one or more glycogen metabolic
enzymes via at least one of these mechanisms. Malin is comprised of a RING
domain, a linker region, and six NHL protein-protein interaction repeats (supplement
Fig. 3A)7. To identify novel malin substrates that could modulate nuclear glycogen, we
purified recombinant malin, incubated the protein with cell extract, and identified
malin-bound proteins by mass spectrometry. The majority of identified interacting
proteins were previously reported including the glycogen phosphatase laforin, glycogen
debranching enzyme (GDE), and HSP70. Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and glycogen
branching enzyme (GBE) were identified as novel putative malin-interacting partners
(supplement Fig. 3A and B). Using co-expression and co-immunoprecipitation
experiments, we validated the known interactions and the malin interaction with GP8.

Malin over-expression (OE) resulted in decreased levels of laforin, HSP70, and GDE
in our model cell line (Fig. 2A), validating previous reports7,8.
GP is a novel malin-interacting protein and both the liver isoform (GPLL) and brain
isoform (GPBB) co-immunoprecipitated with malin (supplement Fig. 3G and H).
Interestingly, malin overexpression resulted in a consistent increase in GP levels,
prompting us to further investigate this interaction (Fig. 2A). The incubation of
recombinant malin with ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme (E2), ATP, and ubiquitin resulted in GP ubiquitination in vitro (Fig. 2B). GPLL
is largely localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C) and co-expression with malin did not
result in GP proteasomal-directed degradation, but rather translocation of GP from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. 2D and supplement Fig. 4A and B). Conversely,
co-expression of a malin point mutation in either the malin RING or NHL domains
abolished the GP nuclear localization (Fig. 2D). Moreover, leptomycin treatment, a
nuclear exportin inhibitor11, resulted in the accumulation of endogenous GP in the
nucleus, suggesting GP translocation is part of normal cellular physiology
(supplement Fig. 4C). GP translocation to the nucleus resulted in degradation of
nuclear glycogen (Fig. 2E).
Glycolytic enzymes have been shown to moonlight in the nucleus with many having
undefined functions12,13. Moreover, pyruvate14,15 and acetate16,17 are the primary
substrates for histone acetylation, but the source for both substrates in the nucleus
remains uncertain. We hypothesized that the existence of nuclear glycogen could be a
separate carbon pool from the cytosolic fraction, supplying metabolic substrates for
histone modification without mobilizing cytosolic metabolites. Therefore, we investigated
the functional role of nuclear glycogen and GP in pyruvate and acetate production and
histone modification using In-Organello Stable Isotope-Enriched Metabolomics (IOSIEM) (Fig. 3A).
We generated 13C-glycogen using a liquid diet stable tracer enrichment method recently
described18. 8-week old mice were fed a 13C6-glucose enriched liquid diet for 48 hours
(supplement Fig. 5A) and liver glycogen was purified by trichloroacetic acid extraction
and ethanol precipitation19. Next, the nucleus from empty vector (EV) or malin-OE cells
were isolated in hypotonic cell lysis buffer. We found that pyruvate is transported into
the nucleus, but neither liver glycogen nor glucose cross the nuclear membrane
(supplement Fig. 5B-F). We then used a nuclear hypotonic lysis buffer to release
nuclear enzymes while preserving enzyme integrity. Nuclear lysates and 13C-glycogen
were incubated in respiration buffer for 6 hours and polar metabolites and their
isotopologues were derivatized and analyzed by gas-chromatography mass
spectrometry (supplemental Fig. 6). Malin-OE and nuclear localization of GP resulted in
the successful breakdown of glycogen and the enrichment of glycolytic metabolites (Fig.
3B-C and supplemental Fig. 6B-E) such as 3PG and pyruvate. TCA cycle metabolites
such as citrate, fumarate, succinate as well as serine and glycine were also identified in
the nucleus but not enriched upon nuclear glycogenolysis (supplement Fig. 6G-M).
Strikingly, both free and histone-bound 13C-acetate were markedly increased with malin
expression (Fig. 3D and E). The enrichment of histone-bound 13C-acetate was

confirmed by immunoblotting showing a dramatic increase in pan-histone acetylation
and a corresponding decrease in pan-histone methylation in malin-OE cell lines (Fig.
3F). This epigenetic change is further validated by increased acetylation and decreased
trimethylation on H3K27 (Fig. 3F). Importantly, H3K27 methylation has been implicated
in lineage switching during NSCLC tumorigenesis20,21. These data reveal nuclear
glycogen as a metabolite source for histone modification, specifically acetylation.
Epigenetic programs, i.e. chromatin organization, dictate cell fate22, control cell cycle23
and contribute to tumorigenesis24. Global changes in histone methylation and
acetylation with malin-OE suggest a shift in the transcriptional landscape. We performed
RNAseq analysis to define transcriptional changes after malin-OE and found that all
three cell lines showed similar changes with an average of 1761 genes that were
downregulated and 1672 genes that were upregulated more than 1.5-fold (Fig. 3G and
supplement Fig. 7A and B). Principle component analysis (PCA) and clustering heat
map analysis placed the EV and malin-OE lines in two separate groups (supplement
Fig. 7C and D). Genes upregulated in malin-OE versus EV were enriched for pathways
involved in metabolism and cell division that influence NSCLC growth. Increases in
glutathione metabolism and amino acid metabolism such as arginine, tryptophan and
histidine metabolism are also observed with malin-OE (supplement Fig. 7E).
Downregulated genes with malin-OE were enriched for glycolysis, oxidative
phosphorylation, and o-glycan biosynthesis (supplement Fig. 7E). Interestingly, genes
involved in DNA demethylation and alkylation were upregulated, while genes involved in
chromosome segregation, cell proliferation, and execution of apoptosis were
downregulated with malin-OE (supplement Fig. 7F).
Histone hypermethylation and hypoacetylation are contributing factors to
tumorigenesis25. Therefore, increased histone acetylation via malin-OE would potentially
have anti-proliferative effects. The NSCLC cell lines A549, H1299, H2030 with malin-OE
or EV were grown as xenografts in immunocompromised mice to assess tumor growth
in vivo. A549 cells with malin-OE grew significantly slower than the EV cell line (Fig 4AB). Similar anti-proliferative effects were seen in H1299 and H2030 cells carrying malinOE (supplemental Fig. 8A-B). Histochemical analysis of these tumors displayed a
decrease in the proliferative marker Ki67 in malin-OE cell lines and a similar decrease in
the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) (Fig 4C and supplement Fig. 8C).
Furthermore, we did not detect any glycogen in malin-OE tumors, confirming the
contribution of malin in glycogenolysis in vivo (supplement Fig. 8C).
This study identifies compartmentalized, nuclear glycogenolysis as a carbon source of
acetate for histone acetylation. The pathway is dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase
malin and its ubiquitination of GP. This process represents a new concept in subcellular organelle communication and signaling by an E3-ligase through glycogen.
Compartmentalized glycogenolysis downstream of malin-GP signaling is a crucial
component of the transcriptional regulatory machinery. The inability to carry out
glycogenolysis in NSCLC from lack of GP results in a lack of substrate for histone
acetylation contributing to the altered epigenetic landscape seen in NSCLC.

These data also provide a context to understand emerging themes in cancer biology
that connect metabolism with epigenetic regulation through undefined links. Mutations in
metabolic enzymes such as isocitrate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, and
succinate dehydrogenase result in over-production of “oncometabolites” such as 2hydroxyglutarate (2HG)26, fumarate27, and succinate28, respectively. Studies suggest
that oncometabolites contribute to cancer malignancy through inhibition of histone and
DNA demethylases. In addition to oncometabolites, it is known that pyruvate/acetate
and serine/methionine are donors for histone acetylation and methylation, respectively.
Dysregulation of acetylation and methylation contributes to tumorigenesis. While the
folate pathway is well described to support methylation, the origin of compartmentalized
pyruvate and acetate had remained ambiguous, especially with previous work showing
nuclear and cytosolic acetyl-CoA pools are maintained separately with limited
equilibration between them16. To date, histone hypoacetylation has been attributed to
the effects of histone deacetylases (HDACs) by DNA hypermethylation29,30. In
organello glycogenolysis is yet another mechanism by which cancer can suppress
histone acetylation and coordinate synergistically with HDACs to drive tumorigenesis.
Downregulation of malin in NSCLC drives cellular proliferation by preventing nuclear
glycogen degradation for histone acetylation. This study identifies the molecular
mechanism of a half-century old observation and defines the role of nuclear glycogen
beyond a simple energy cache to regulating epigenetics through acetylation. Given the
significant reduction in mouse xenograft growth, the glycogen metabolic pathway
represents a novel therapeutic target for NSCLC.
