Abstract
Hollow hydroxyapatite (HA) microspheres showed the ability to facilitate bone regeneration

3

in rats with non-healing calvarial defects. However, new bone formation in the rat calvarial defect

4

implanted with the closed HA microspheres was limited. The objective of this work is to evaluate

5

size-, time, and structure-dependent bone regeneration between open and closed HA microspheres in

6

an osseous model. Open HA microspheres were obtained by sectioning closed HA microspheres.

7

The open HA microsphere had dense convex surface and rough and porous concave surface. For

8

both size ranges (œï106-150 Œºm vs. œï212-250 Œºm), the open HA microsphere were more effective in

9

facilitating bone regeneration than the closed HA microspheres in rat calvarial defects. Bone

10

regeneration in the open HA microspheres (49 ¬± 7% for œï106-150 Œºm; 40 ¬± 8% for œï212-250 Œºm)

11

were higher than the closed HA microsphere (26 ¬± 8% for œï106-150 Œºm; 30 ¬± 9% for œï212-250 Œºm)

12

at 12 weeks. Furthermore, the open HA microspheres of smaller size showed a significant increase in

13

bone regeneration than the open HA microspheres of larger size at both 6 weeks and 12 weeks. The

14

difference in bone regeneration between these microspheres could be due to their differences in

15

microstructures, namely curvature, concavity, porosity, surface roughness, and total surface area

16

available for cells to attached to.

Introduction
Effective regeneration of bone defects caused by trauma or chronic diseases is a significant

3

clinical challenge. Over the past few decades, researchers have investigated the mechanism of bone

4

regeneration to better inform the designs of healing strategies [1-3]. Bone healing involves three

5

primary stages: the early inflammatory stage; the repair stage and the late remodeling stage [4].

6

These three stages are distinct, but continuous. In the inflammatory stage, a hematoma forms and

7

inflammatory cells infiltrate the bone, resulting in the formation of granulation tissue, vascular tissue

8

and immature tissue. During the repair stage, new blood vessels are developed to facilitate tissue

9

regeneration and a soft callus is formed around the repair site. Bone healing is completed during the

10

remodeling stage in which the bone is restored to its original shape, structure and mechanical

11

strength.

12

Clinically, bone deficiency is overcome using treatments that rely on bone regeneration and

13

augmentation. While various treatments have been investigated with encouraging results [5],

14

complete and predictable bone reconstruction is often difficult [6]. Autologous bone grafts are the

15

gold standard for treatment because they contain osteoinductive growth factors, osteogenic cells and

16

a structural scaffold. However, disadvantages of this treatment include limited tissue availability,

17

increased surgery time, additional pain and cosmetic imperfection at the donor site [6-8]. Many of

18

these issues can increase the health care cost for the patient [9]. An alternative to autogenous bone is

19

allogenic bone, which can induce moderate healing results due to its preserved osteoinductivity.

20

However, allografts are costly, can have unpredictable effects on growth due to donor variance,

21

cause adverse immune reactions, and increase the risk of disease transference [10-12]. Synthetic bone

22

grafts have advantages such as consistent quality, safety, and good tissue tolerance, but they usually

23

function as inert or merely osteoconductive implants. Encouraging results have been reported.

24

Hydroxyapatite (HA), the main component and essential ingredient of human bone, can be

25

prepared by chemical reactions. Studies have demonstrated that HA supports bone regeneration and

26

bonding to surrounding tissue because of its biocompatibility, bioactivity, and osteoconductivity

27

[13]. Our studies with the closed HA microspheres showed the ability to regenerate bone in non-

28

healing rat calvarial defects [14, 15]. Experiments with œï106-150 ùúám and œï150-250 ùúám closed HA

29

microspheres showed differences in mechanical properties and biological tests [16]. The size

30

variation of closed HA microspheres could affect the structure of HA microspheres. The changes in

31

structure can influence on the biological tests in return. We sporadically observed that there tended to

32

be better bone regeneration with broken closed microspheres with micro-concavity [15, 17]. This

33

observation motivated us to design this study that focused on enhanced bone regeneration with open

34

microspheres. We hypothesize that open HA microsphere with special geometric characters can yield

35

better bone regeneration compared with the closed HA microspheres. Our goal is to investigate

36

whether bone regeneration in an osseous model is microgeometry-, size-, and time-dependent. To

37

achieve our goal, two size ranges (œï106-150 Œºm and œï212-250 Œºm) of closed and open HA

38

microspheres were created. Bone regeneration was conducted with a rat calvarial defect model. No

39

osteoinductive agents were added in order to distinguish the intrinsic osteogenic properties of the

40

open HA microspheres.

Preparation of closed and open hollow hydroxyapatite (HA)

43

microspheres

44

The closed hollow HA microspheres were prepared by conversion solid glass microspheres in

45

aqueous phosphate solution as described in a previous study. Briefly, calcium-lithium-borate glass

46

with the composition of 15CaO, 11Li2O and 74B2O3 (wt. %), designated as CaLB3-15, was prepared

47

by melting CaCO3, Li2CO3, H3BO3 (Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA, USA) in a platinum crucible at 1200

48

¬∞C for 45 min and then quenching the melt between stainless steel plates. Glass particles of were

49

obtained by grinding the glass via a mortar and pestle, crashing in a shatter box and sieving through

50

100 and 140 mesh sieves for œï106-150 Œºm in size, or 60 and 70 mesh sieves for œï212-250 Œºm in

51

size. Glass microspheres were obtained by dropping the crushed particles down through a vertical

52

furnace at 1200 ¬∞C. The closed hollow hydroxyapatite microspheres were obtained by reacting the

53

glass microspheres in a 0.02 M K2HPO4 solution at 37 ¬∞C and pH = 9 for 7 days. In the conversion

54

process, 1 g glass was immersed in a 200 ml phosphate solution and the system was stirred gently

55

and continuously. The converted microspheres were washed with distilled water and anhydrous

56

ethanol, and then dried at room temperature for at least 12 h and at 90 ¬∞C for at least 12 h.

57

The open hollow HA microspheres were obtained by sectioning the closed hollow HA

58

microspheres using a microtome. Briefly, the closed HA microspheres were fixed on a wax block

59

using a water-soluble tape and were sectioned by microtome. The open HA microspheres were

60

washed with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried at room temperature for at least 12 h and at

61

90 ¬∞C for at least 12 h. The debris in open HA microspheres were removed using sieves.

Characterization of closed and open hollow hydroxyapatite (HA)

63

microspheres

64

The microstructures of the closed HA microspheres, cross-section of closed HA microspheres,

65

and open HA microspheres were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; S4700

66

Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 15kV and working distance at 12 mm. The

67

local composition of the surface layer, middle layer and inner layer of the mesoporous shell wall of

68

the HA microspheres was investigated using energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) analysis in SEM with an

69

electron beam spot size of 1 Œºm.

70

The specific surface area (SSA) of the closed and open HA microspheres and pore size

71

distribution of the shell wall were measured by using nitrogen absorption (Autosorb-1;

72

Quantachrome, Boynton Beach, FL) as described in a previous study. Three hundred milligrams of

73

closed or open HA microspheres were weighted and evacuated at 120 ¬∞C for 15 h to remove

74

absorbed moisture. The volume of nitrogen absorbed and desorbed at different relative gas pressure

75

was measured and used to construct adsorption-desorption isotherms. The first twelve points of the

76

adsorption isotherm, which initially followed a linear trend implying monolayer formation of

77

adsorbate, were fitted to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation to determine the specific surface area.

78

The pore size distribution of the shell wall of the hollow HA microspheres was calculated using the

79

Barrett-Joiner-Halenda method applied to the deposition isotherms [18].

All animal use and care procedures were approved by the Missouri S&T Institutional Animal

82

Care and Use Committee in compliance with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory

83

Animals (1985). The rat calvarial defects were implanted with four groups of implants composed of

84

closed or open hollow HA microspheres for 6 weeks and 12 weeks (Table 1). The implantation time

85

was based upon considerable bone regeneration in rat calvarial defects implanted with hollow HA

86

microspheres observed in previous studies. The closed or open HA microspheres of œï212-250 Œºm

87

were randomly implanted to defect areas. The closed or open HA microspheres of œï106-150 Œºm

88

microspheres were randomly implanted to defect areas, but mixing implants of closed and open

89

microspheres in the same animal was avoided due to the possible migration of low-weight open HA

90

microspheres.

anesthesia with isoflurane in oxygen. The surgery area was shaved, scrubbed with 70% ethanol and

96

iodine, and draped. With sterile instruments and using an aseptic technique, a 1 cm cranial skin

97

incision was made in an anterior to posterior direction along the midline. The subcutaneous tissue,

98

musculature and periosteum were dissected and reflected to expose the calvaria. Bilateral full

99

thickness defects (4.6 mm in diameter) were created in the central area of each parietal bone using a

100

saline-cooled trephine drill. The sites were constantly irrigated with sterile PBS to prevent

101

overheating of the bone margins and to remove the bone debris. Each defect was randomly implanted

102

with HA microspheres of each group. After the implantation of the hollow HA microspheres, one

103

drop of Ringer‚Äôs solution was added to each defect. The periosteum and skin were repositioned and

104

closed with wound clips. Each animal received an intramuscular injection of ~200 Œºl buprenorphine

105

and ~200 Œºl penicillin post-surgery. All animals were monitored daily for the condition of the

106

surgical wound, food intake, activity and clinical signs of infection. After 6 weeks, the animals were

107

sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and the calvarial defect sites with surrounding bone and soft tissue

108

were harvested for subsequent evaluations.

Histological processing

110

Harvested calvarial samples were fixed in a 10% formaldehyde solution for five days. The

111

samples were cut into half after being washed with deionized water. Half of the sample was for

112

paraffin embedding, and the other half was for poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) embedding. The

113

paraffin-embedded samples were decalcified in 14 wt. % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA,

114

Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 2 weeks, dehydrated in ethanol, and then embedded in paraffin using

115

standard histological techniques. These samples were sectioned using microtome. The thickness of

116

the tissue section with paraffin was 5 Œºm. These slices were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin

117

(H&E) [19]. Without decalcification, the samples for PMMA embedding were dehydrated in ethanol

118

and embedded in PMMA. These samples were sectioned, affixed to acrylic slices, and ground to a

119

thickness down to 50 Œºm using a micro-grinding system (EXAKT 400CS, Norderstedt, Germany).

120

The von Kossa staining was used to observe mineralization [20].

121

Histomorphometric analysis

122

Histomorphometric analysis was carried out using optical images of stained sections and

123

Image J software (National Health Institute, USA). The percentage of new bone formed in calvarial

124

defect was evaluated from the H&E stained sections. The newly formed bone was identified by

125

outlining the edge of the defect, with the presence of old and new bone being identified by lamellar

126

and woven bone, respectively. The total defect area was measured from one edge of the old calvarial

127

bone, including the entire implant and tissue within it, to the other edge of the old bone. The newly

128

formed bone within this area was then outlined and measured; the amount of the new bone was

129

expressed as a percentage of the total defect area. The amount of von Kossa positive area was shown

130

as a percent of the total defect area.

131

Statistical analysis

132

Measurements of the percentage of new bone (relative to the entire defect area) were

133

expressed as a mean ¬± SD. Analysis for differences between groups was performed using one-way

134

analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey‚Äôs post hoc test; the differences were

135

considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results

137

Geometry of the closed and open hydroxyapatite microspheres

138

The closed HA microspheres were prepared by converting glass microspheres in a phosphate

139

solution. The diameters of the starting glass microspheres were œï106-150 Œºm and œï212-250 Œºm,

140

respectively. After conversion, changes in the diameter of the microspheres were negligible. The

141

SEM images revealed a spherical shape of closed HA microspheres with two size ranges: œï106-150

142

Œºm (thereafter, small size; Fig. 1A1 and A2) and œï212-250 Œºm (thereafter, large size; Fig. 1C1 and

143

C2). Open HA microspheres were sectioned from closed HA microspheres using a microtone. The

144

SEM images confirmed precise sectioning of open HA microspheres of both sizes (Fig. 1B1, B2, D1

145

and D2). Compared to the complete spherical structure of closed HA microspheres, the open HA

146

microspheres were near hemispherical. The hollow microsphere had a mesoporous shell and a

147

hollow core (0.6 of the microsphere diameter). The shell wall consisted of two distinct layers: a

148

denser external layer and a more porous internal layer. For both size ranges of HA microspheres, the

149

thickness of the denser layer was ~ 5 Œºm. The open HA microspheres of both sizes showed the dense

150

external part and rough and porous internal part of the shell wall (Fig. 2). Both size ranges of the

151

closed and open HA microspheres showed similar microstructures of the shell wall. The HA

152

microspheres were formed by needle-like hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. The external surface tended

153

to be denser than the internal surface.

5. Bone regeneration was limited and confined mainly to the edge of the defects and some bone

185

bridging along the bottom of implants. Fibrous tissues (light blue in H&E stained sections) filled the

186

space between the microspheres. New bone formation in the implants with the smaller size of closed

187

and open HA microspheres was 12 ¬± 3% and 17 ¬± 6%, respectively (Fig. 4 and Table 4). The von

188

Kossa positive areas in in the implants with the smaller size of closed and open HA microspheres

189

were 41 ¬± 3% and 49 ¬± 5%, respectively (Table 5). The percentages of new bone in the implants

190

with the larger size of closed and open HA microspheres were 6 ¬± 2 % and 12 ¬± 3 %, respectively

191

(Fig. 5). The von Kossa positive areas in the implants with the larger size of closed and open HA

192

microspheres were 30 ¬± 3% and 35 ¬± 3%, respectively. Open HA microspheres showed significant

193

improvement in bone regeneration compared with closed HA microspheres for both size ranges at 6

194

weeks in rat calvarial defects (n = 5, p‚Äôs < 0.05 for both sizes, Fig. 8 and 9). Smaller closed HA

195

microspheres showed a significant increase in bone regeneration than the larger closed HA

196

microspheres (n = 5, p < 0.05). Based on the H&E results, there was a borderline difference in new

197

bone formation between the two size ranges of open HA microspheres (n = 5, p = 0.050). However,

198

based on von Kossa results, the smaller open HA microspheres showed a significant enhancement in

199

bone growth compared to the larger open HA microspheres (n = 5, p < 0.001).

Higher magnification images of the closed and open HA microspheres of both sizes are shown

221

in Fig. 4C and D (from the boxed areas of Fig. 4A1 and A2) and Fig. 5C and D (from the boxed

222

areas in Fig. 5A1 and A2). For the closed HA microspheres in both size ranges, bone formation was

223

scanty, while the fibrous tissues filled the pore space between the closed HA microspheres and

224

infiltrated into the hollow core of some broken closed HA microspheres. In comparison, more bone

225

regeneration was observed in the micro-concavity of open HA microspheres (indicated by blue

226

arrows) in both sizes (œï106-150 Œºm and œï212-250 Œºm).

227

The outcomes from the implants with the closed and open HA microspheres of the two size

228

ranges after 12 weeks in rat calvarial defects are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. New bones were formed

229

from the edge of the defects and on the bottom of the implants. For the open HA microspheres of

230

both size ranges, more new bone growth in the micro-concavity can be found; the remaining open

231

HA microspheres can be observed in the new bone bridging the ends of defects. For the closed and

232

open HA microspheres of small size (Fig. 6), the percentages of new bone formation were 26 ¬± 8%

(n = 5~10, p > 0.05). However, smaller open HA microspheres showed a more significant increase in

241

bone regeneration than larger closed HA microspheres (n = 5, p < 0.05). Bone regeneration was

242

time-dependent for both size ranges; new bone formation increased significantly from 6 weeks to 12

259

The capability of HA microspheres to regenerate bone can presumably be affected by the

260

differences between closed and open HA microspheres in microstructure. In this study, the

261

microstructure of closed and open HA microspheres in two size ranges (œï106-150 Œºm vs. œï212-250

262

Œºm) were analyzed. To test HA microspheres in facilitating bone regeneration, rat calvarial defects

263

were created and HA microspheres were implanted. Bone regeneration was evaluated in weeks 6 &

264

12.

265

For both size ranges, the thickness of the denser (outer) layer was ~ 5 Œºm, while the ratio of

266

the hollow core diameter to the microsphere diameter is ~0.6. The factors leading to these two

267

distinct layers are still unclear. In the glass conversion process [16, 21-23], ions are dissolved from

268

glass (i.e., Ca2+, Li+, B3+) to the aqueous solution. The Ca2+ from glass reacts immediately with

269

phosphate anions from solution to form calcium phosphate. The calcium phosphate precipitates onto

270

the glass surface due to its insolubility in the system. As the glass dissolves, the calcium phosphate

271

layer continues to thicken until the glass is completely converted to calcium phosphate. The kinetics

272

and mechanism of the formation of the HA layer in borate glass is investigated in several studies [22,

273

24-26]. The conversion rate is initially described by a reaction-controlled model (linear kinetics);

274

however, at the later stage, a three-dimensional diffusion model (parabolic kinetics) better explains

275

the conversion rate. Presumably, the denser layer and porous layer results from these two kinetic

276

models. Additional experiments can be set-up to further investigate the dynamic changes of SSA and

277

pore size.

Our in vivo experiment showed the effectiveness of open HA microspheres in bone
regeneration. For both size ranges of the open HA microspheres, new bone formation was observed

280

in both 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-implantation. The amount of new bone growth increased from 6

281

weeks to 12 weeks. In the study of 12-week implantation with small microspheres, new bone

282

formation with the implants of open microsphere was about twice that of the closed microspheres;

283

for large microspheres, new bone formation in the implants of open microspheres was about 30%

284

higher than that of the closed microspheres. Thus, the open microspheres were more effective in

285

facilitating bone regeneration than the closed microspheres. Compared to the closed microsphere, the

286

open microsphere had a micro-concave region with a more porous and rougher surface (see Fig

287

1&2). These characters (i.e., micro-concavity, porosity, roughness) could contribute to the difference

288

in bone regeneration between the closed and open microspheres.

289

The effectiveness of micro-concavity in bone regeneration has been investigated by others

290

[27-32]. Substantial mineralization of simulated body fluid on the discs made of calcium phosphate

291

ceramic were observed inside concavities but not at the planar surface [31]. Smaller concavity (0.4

292

mm in diameter) can induce much more mineralization than larger concavities (0.8 mm or 1.8 mm in

293

diameter) [31]. An in vivo study demonstrated that concavity appeared to stimulate formation of

294

blood vessels, a critical process for bone formation [32]. Stem cells showed better outcomes on a

295

concave surface than a flat surface in terms of cell maturation, osteodifferentiation, and specific

296

protein production [28]. Bone formation by intramembranous ossification preferred to occur on a

297

concave surface as well [30]. Concavity is also conducive to accumulation of growth factors such as

298

BMPs [27]. Differences in microstructure may also be a contributing factor to the outcome of bone

299

regeneration. The internal concave surface was more porous and rougher compared to external

300

convex surface.

301

The differences in porosity and roughness could influence dissolution/degradation of

302

biomaterials, adsorption of growth factors, and mineral deposition from body fluid [33-40]. For

303

instance, the degradation of a porous surface could lead to faster Ca2+ release which is a key factor in

304

facilitating angiogenesis [41]. Further, a more porous and rougher surface could be a more suitable

305

substrate for adsorption of biologically active molecules, such as BMPs and growth factors.

306

Together, these lead to enhanced cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation.

307

Dissolution/degradation of HA have been shown to be affected by the ratio of Ca/P of the

308

microspheres [42-44]. The dissolution of HA in water increased as the Ca/P ratio decreased [42].

309

Higher dissolution/degradation of HA could release more Ca2+ and phosphate ions, which could

310

facilitate bone regeneration. In this study, there was no significant difference in Ca/P ratio within the

311

three regions or between the two size ranges of HA microspheres. It is possible that the Ca/P ratio of

312

our HA microspheres can be manipulated to achieve varying degree of dissolution.

313

The current study demonstrated that the small open microspheres induced a more significant

314

increase in bone regeneration than the large open microspheres at both 6 weeks and 12 weeks. One

315

reason for this difference may be attributed to total surface area on microspheres where cells can be

316

attached to. A simulation of the difference in available surface area for cell attachment was made.

317

Given the same mass, the same size distribution pattern of the open and closed microspheres of the

318

same size, and the same density of the shell of the microspheres of different sizes, the open

319

microspheres of the same size have larger surface area than that of the closed microspheres for cells

320

to attached to. For instance, the closed and open microspheres of œï106-150 Œºm have surface areas of

321

584 cm2 (assuming the total volume of the microsphere shell is 1 cm3) and 981 cm2, respectively.

322

The closed and open microspheres of œï212-250 Œºm surface areas of have 328 cm2 and 552 cm2,

323

respectively. Another reason for the difference in bone regeneration could be due to the curvature.

324

The small microspheres have higher curvature than the large microspheres. It remains to be

325

investigated how the curvature of the microspheres affect cellular physiology leading to the

326

differential outcome of bone regeneration.

327

An apparent observation is that new bone formation with implants of the small open

328

microspheres was able to completely bridge the defects at the bottoms of all the implants. In

329

comparison, not all animals with closed microspheres were able to bridge the entire defects. During

330

the regeneration process, new bone formation started from the edge of the host bone and from the

331

bottom of the defect (dura matter), where osteogenic cells and blood supply were abundant. The

332

open microspheres might absorb the osteogenic factors by diffusion or fluid transport and trigger

333

bone growth in the micro-concavity. The open microspheres at the bottom of the implants had the

334

best chance of contact with the osteogenic factors not only from dura matter but also from the edges

335

induced by the open microsphere in periphery. We observed that a large number of smaller pieces of

336

open microspheres was found in the bottom of the implants. This might be caused by the rats‚Äô

337

physical activity of daily living.

338

In this work, the closed HA microspheres of œï106-150 ¬µm significantly enhance bone

339

regeneration than those of œï 212-250 ¬µm at 6 weeks; no significant difference in bone regeneration

340

between two size ranges at 12 weeks. Compared to the work by Fu [14], new bone formation with

341

the closed HA microspheres of œï150-250 ¬µm was significantly greater than that with the closed HA

342

microspheres of œï106-150 ¬µm at 12 weeks. It should be noted that there is a significant difference in

343

the size range of the large microspheres between these two studies; thus, they should not be viewed

344

as conflicting results.

345

Conclusion

346

The open HA microspheres significantly enhance the bone regeneration as compared to the

347

closed HA microspheres at both 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Compared with the larger size of open HA

348

microspheres (smaller curvature), the smaller size of open HA microspheres (larger curvature)

349

resulted in a more significant increase in bone regeneration. The differences in microstructures of the

350

HA microspheres (i.e., curvature, concavity, porosity, surface roughness, total surface area available

351

for cells to attached to) may deserve future attention of investigation.
