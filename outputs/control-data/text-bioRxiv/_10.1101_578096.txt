Abstract
The human erythroleukemia (K562) cells are considered as bipotent megakaryocyte-erythroid
progenitor cells and the differentiation of these cells to megakaryocytes (MK) in the presence of
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) mimics in vivo differentiation of MEP (megakaryocyteerythroid progenitor) cells in the bone marrow. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in
gene suppression and their roles during the MK differentiation remains largely undefined. In the
present study, we have studied the expression levels of class I and class II HDACs during
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation of K562 cells to MK. Class IIb
HDACs (HDAC6 & HDAC10) were significantly up regulated time dependently upto 4 days of
PMA-induced MK differentiation along with decreased acetylation levels of H3K9 and H3K56.
Pharmacological inhibition and knockdown studies of HDAC6 using tubastatin A (TubA) and
shRNA-HDAC6 respectively, during MK differentiation resulted in down regulation of MK
lineage marker CD61 and up regulation of erythroid lineage gene glycophorin A (GYPA).
HDAC6 over expression in K562 cells showed significant up regulation of CD61, MK
transcription factors (FOG1 and GATA2) and down regulation of GYPA. ChIP-PCR studies
showed enrichment of HDAC6 protein on GYPA promoter during differentiation indicating
GYPA gene repression by HDAC6. Further studies on elucidating the role of HDAC6 in MK
differentiation clearly indicated that HDAC6 is required for the production of sustainable levels
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an important regulator of MK differentiation, via NOX4.ROS-HDAC6 circuit. In this study, we provide the first evidence that during PMA-induced
megakaryocyte differentiation of K562 cells, HDAC6 represses erythroid lineage marker gene,
GYPA, and promotes the sustainable levels of ROS via NOX4 required for MK differentiation.

Key words: PMA-induced MK differentiation of K562 cells, HDAC6, erythroid lineage gene
repression, sustainable ROS, NOX4.

Introduction
Survival, self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in to blood cells is
tightly regulated by expression of transcription factors, cytokines and miRNAs1-5.
Megakaryocytes and erythrocytes are derived from a common megakaryocyte-erythroid
progenitor (MEP) cells 6. Megakaryocytes (MK) produce enucleated platelets that are involved
in blood clotting, hemostasis and in immune response 7. Thrombocytopenia, reduced platelets
count, is a clinical problem in many disease conditions such as cancer therapy, trauma, sepsis
and viral infections such as dengue, etc 8 and requires platelet transfusion. The two reasons for
thrombocytopenia are reduced production from MK cells or increased destruction of platelets9.
Better understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating MK differentiation and platelet
production are required to identify the safe sources of platelets for therapeutic purposes and to
cure the platelet diseases.

K562 cells are chronic myeloid leukemia cells, well studied model system to find out the
molecular mechanisms regulating the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages in the presence of
different chemical inducers 10. PMA (Phorbal 12-myristate 13-acetate) induces the differentiation
of K562 cells towards megakaryocyte lineage whereas hemin, hydroxyurea and Ara-C
(Arabinosyl cytosine) induce erythroid differentiation of these cells

11,12

. The differentiation of

K562 cells to megakaryocytes is monitored by cell growth arrest, changes in morphology,
endomitosis and adhesive properties due to expression of integrins CD61 and CD41 (MK
markers)13 and reduced expression of erythroid genes Glycophorin A (GYPA). PMA induces the
activation of PKC leading to further ERK1/2, c-JUN, c-FOS and NF-κB transcription factor
activation 14-17. PMA also induces ROS production in K562 cells and ROS is an important factor
driving MK cell differentiation 18.

The two epigenetic marks that play an important role in gene regulation are methylation and
acetylation. Acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins is controlled by histone acetyl
transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) respectively. Deacetylation of histone
proteins by HDACs leads to the formation of compact chromatin which prevents the binding of
transcriptional machinery and thus gene suppression

physiological and pathological processes by regulating the activity of non-histone proteins by
deacetylation

20

. Total of 18 HDACs have been identified in humans and divided into four

classes based on their homology to yeast orthologs. Class I (HDAC1,2,3,4,8), Class II
(HDAC4,5,7,9 & 6,10) and class IV (HDAC11) are classical zinc dependent enzymes whereas
class III HDACs are named as sirtuins from SIRT1-7 which requires NAD+ as cofactor for their
activity

21-23

. Recent studies indicate that the epigenetic gene regulation governs the stem cell

differentiation and the role of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) in reprogramming of somatic cells to
pluripotency is well established 24.
The commitment of the bipotent progenitor cells to a particular lineage requires
suppression of the opposite lineage genes. Since HDACs are involved in gene repression via
compact chromatin formation, we hypothesize that one or few of the HDACs might be involved
in lineage commitment of progenitor cells. Although the involvement of HDACs in
hematopoiesis is known, the role of HDACs and the underlying molecular mechanisms of
lineage commitment remain elusive. Recently, Messaoudi et al have shown that, HDAC6 plays
an important role in proplatelet release from MKs by deacetylating cortactin, an important
cytoskeletal protein25. We therefore, in the present study, aimed at identifying the role of
HDACs in MK lineage commitment of K562 cells.

Methods
Cell culture
K562 cells were obtained from the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) cell repository,
India. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Fetal
Bovine Serum) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin and grown at 37 oC, 5% CO2. The
exponentially growing K562 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 x105 cells / ml and treated with
20 nM PMA for 24 h and 48 h. In combination treatments, the cells were treated with 5 µM
tubastatin A or 100 µM quercetin, 1 h prior to PMA addition and the control cells received
DMSO alone.

Results
Differential expression of classIIb HDACs with decreased acetylation levels of H3K9 and
H3K56 during MK differentiation of K562 cells
PMA-induced MK differentiation of K562 cells was confirmed by change in morphology of cells
(Fig 1A), upregulation of MK markers such as CD41 and CD61 and downregulation of an
erythroid marker glycophorin A (GYPA) (Fig 1B). Once the model system was validated, we
next did HDAC expression profiling (mRNA and protein expression). The expression levels of
class I (HDAC1, 2 and 8) and class IIa HDACs (HDAC4) did not change significantly in control
and PMA-treated cells (Fig 1C & D). However, RNA and protein levels of class IIb HDACs,
HDAC6 and 10, were significantly upregulated during MK differentiation (Fig 1C & D). Further,
time-course mRNA expression analysis indicated upregulation of HDAC6 along with MK
markers till 4 days of PMA treatment and gradual downregulation of GYPA significantly (Fig.
1E). Since histones are the primary substrates for HDACs, we have analyzed the global
acetylation levels of lysine residues of histone H3. We have observed a significant decrease in
acetyl levels of H3K9 and H3K56 during PMA-induced differentiation of K562 cells (Fig 1F),
suggesting these might be the targets of upregulated class IIb HDACs. The acetylation levels of
H3K18, H3K14 and H3K27 did not alter in control and PMA treated cells (Fig 1F).

HDAC6 upregulation is specific to K562 cell differentiation to MK cells.
PMA is known to activate several signaling pathways including PKC and PI3K. So we asked the
question whether HDAC6 upregulation is due to PMA signaling or is MK lineage specific. To
address this, we assessed the expression levels of HDAC6 in PMA-induced HL-60 cells that
differentiate into monocytes. The results showed no change in HDAC6 expression levels in
PMA-induced HL-60 cells indicating that HDAC6 upregulation is MK lineage specific (Fig.
2A). To better understand the role of HDAC6 in MK differentiation as a repressor of gene or as a
protein activity regulator, we first investigated HDAC6 localization by confocal microscopy. As
shown in Fig. 2B, HDAC6 is predominantly localized to the nucleus during MK differentiation
when compared to pan-cellular distribution in control cells. Immunoblot analysis of the
cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions also indicated similar results (Supplementary Fig. S1). To get
an insight into the nuclear function of HDAC6, we analyzed the acetylation levels of the two

histone H3 lysine residues, H3K9 and H3K56, that were actually downregulated during MK
differentiation (Fig. 1F) in presence of HDAC6-specific inhibitor, Tubastatin A (Tub A). The
specificity of Tub A towards HDAC6 was confirmed by analyzing the Ac-tubulin levels dosedependently (Supplementary Fig. S2) and also its inhibitory effect on other HDACs by
Immunoblot (Supplementary Fig. S3). The Ac- H3K9 and Ac-H3K56 immunoblot showed a
significant increase in the acetylation levels of H3K9 and H3K56 (Fig. 2C) suggesting that
HDAC6 might be playing an important role as a transcriptional regulator during PMA-induced
differentiation of K562 cells to MK cells. We next investigated the mechanism by which
HDAC6 is upregulated during MK differentiation of K562 cells. We analyzed the PKC pathway
activated by PMA in K562 cells during MK differentiation. We determined the levels of
phospho-ERK and Ac-NF-κB in control and PMA-treated K562 cells. In the immunoblots, we
found increased p-ERK levels and increased Ac-NF-κB (K310) along with increased HDAC6
during PMA treatment (Fig 2D). Further, we found reduced HDAC6 expression when ERK1/2
activation was inhibited with apigenin (Fig 2E) during PMA induced differentiation of K562
cells suggesting that HDAC6 upregulation during MK differentiation is via PKC-p-ERK-NF-κB
axis.
HDAC6 is required for the expression of MK markers and inhibition of erythroid marker
To further delineate the role of HDCA6 during MK differentiation, we have treated the cells with
Tub A, and analyzed the expression levels of MK lineage genes. The qPCR results clearly
indicated that MK markers were downregulated when HDAC6 is inhibited in PMA treated cells
along with significant upregulation of erythroid marker (Fig 3A). We also measured the protein
levels of CD61 by flow cytometry and the results are in agreement with qPCR data (Fig 3B (i) &
(ii)). Next we performed HDAC6 knockdown during MK differentiation with shRNA (pLKO.1
HDAC6) and studied the MK linage commitment. The expression analysis of MK marker
(CD61) and erythroid marker (GYPA) showed significant reduced levels of CD61 with
significant induction of GYPA during MK differentiation (Fig 3C), mimicking effects obtained
with Tub A. To further probe the effect of HDAC6 during MK differentiation, we have
overexpressed HDAC6 in K562 cells and studied the MK lineage marker expression.
Overexpression of HDAC6 in K562 cells was confirmed at the RNA level by qPCR (Fig 3D (i)),
protein level by immunoblot (Fig 3D (ii)) and activity by HDAC assay (Fig 3D (iii)).

Overexpression of HDAC6 resulted in significant upregulation of CD61, but not CD41 and
downregulation of erythroid lineage gene, GYPA (Fig 3E). These results suggest that HDAC6
might be negatively regulating erythroid lineage gene, GYPA expression and positively
regulating the MK lineage gene, CD61 expression. We then sought to determine how HDAC6 is
positively regulating the expression of MK marker (CD61). To explore this, we have analysed
the expression levels of MK transcription factors GATA2, FOG-1 and GATA1 in HDAC6
inhibited cells treated with PMA. We observed reduced expression of GATA2 and FOG-1 in
Tub A treated cells alone but not in HDAC6 inhibited cells treated with PMA (Fig 3F). On the
contrary, we observed upregulation of GATA2 and FOG-1 in HDAC6 overexpressed cells
without PMA treatment (Fig 3G). These results suggest that HDAC6 might be regulating the
expression of GATA2 and FOG-1 indirectly that in turn regulate CD61 expression.
HDAC6 represses GYPA promoter
When HDAC6 was inhibited with tubastatin A, we have observed upregulation of GYPA not
only in PMA-treated K562 cells, but also in K562 cells treated with Tub A alone (Fig 4A). But
we did not observe significant effect on other erythroid lineage genes like globin and EKLF
γ

(Fig 4B). This prompted us to look into the role of HDAC6 in GYPA transcriptional repression.
We therefore designed 5 sets of primers from first intron to the 1400 bp upstream to the
transcription start site (TSS) of GYPA promoter (Fig. 4C) and did ChIP-PCR with HDAC6
antibody. We observed a 2-fold enrichment of HDAC6 over the GYPA promoter at 4 out of 5
sites studied in control cells (Fig 4D). However, there was a significant enrichment at site 1 (1363 bp to 1183 bp) in PMA-treated cells. The HDAC6 binding decreased significantly at site 1
when treated with Tub A (Fig 4D) in control cells. These results clearly indicated that HDAC6
plays an important role in repressing erythroid-specific lineage gene, GYPA.
Crosstalk between PMA signalling, ROS and HDAC6 during MK differentiation
The strong nuclear localization of HDAC6 in the present study correlated, partly, with the GYPA
gene repressing function of HDAC6. However, the immunofluorescence and immunoblot data
indicated cytoplasmic presence of HDAC6. So we also focused on other probable functions
HDAC6 might be having during MK differentiation. Since the role of HDAC6 in ROS
production and the role of ROS in MK biology is well known, we tried to find a link between

ROS and HDAC6 in MK differentiation. We measured ROS levels using H2DCF-DA by flow
cytometry and observed increased ROS levels in PMA treated cells that were reduced upon
HDAC6 inhibition (Fig 5A). Since NADPH oxidases are involved in ROS production, we next
examined the effect of Tub A on NOX2 and NOX4 expression and found that NOX4 was
upregulated during MK differentiation and significantly downregulated in the presence of
HDAC6 inhibitor with no change in NOX2 expression (Fig 5B) suggesting for the first time that
PMA-induced ROS production in MK differentiation of K562 cells is via NOX4. In addition, we
have observed downregulation of NOX4 in HDAC6 knockdown cells (Fig 5C). To further
understand the relation between HDAC6 and NOX4, we analyzed the effect of an antioxidant,
quercetin, on the expression of HDAC6, NOX2, NOX4 and MK markers during PMA-induced
differentiation of K562 cells. During MK differentiation in the presence of antioxidant,
significant reduction in the expression levels of HDAC6 and NOX4 along with MK markers was
observed (Fig 5D). This result implicated a clear crosstalk between HDAC6, NOX4 and ROS
during MK differentiation. Next, we confirmed the role of HDAC6 in ROS production via
NOX4 in MK biology, by analysing the mRNA levels of survivin gene, a chromosome passenger
protein involved in cell division. During MK differentiation, survivin is downregulated so as to
promote polyploidy in MK cell. We observed that survivin is upregulated when HDAC6 is
inhibited (Fig 5E) suggesting that ROS produced by NOX4 is important for polyploidy of MK
cell and that HDAC6 is involved in ROS production. Taken together, these results confirm the
interplay between ROS, NOX4 and HDAC6 during PMA induced differentiation of K562 cells.

Discussion
HDACs are involved in the regulation of gene expression and also control various biological
processes by deacetylation of non-histone proteins

27

. Hematopoiesis is a process of

differentiation of blood cells from the hematopoietic stem cells that are regulated by various
transcription factors, cytokines and miRNAs 2. Earlier studies have shown that sustained
expression of HDAC1 by GATA1 transcription factor allows the differentiation of myeloid
progenitor’s cells to erythrocyte and megakaryocytic lineages

28

. Treatment of human primary

CD34+ cells with sub-optimal concentration of panobinostat, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, does not
affect the MK proliferation or commitment but inhibited maturation and platelet formation29.

But the molecular mechanisms and specific roles of HDACs during the MK differentiation
remain unclear. In this study we have shown the upregulation of Class IIb HDACs (HDAC6 and
HDAC10) with decreased acetylation levels of H3K9 and H3K56 during PMA induced
differentiation of K562 cells to megakaryocytes. HDAC6 is upregulated time dependently
peaking at 4th day of PMA treatment, and is required for the expression of MK markers CD61
and CD41, inhibition of erythroid lineage gene, GYPA and is involved in sustainable production
of ROS.
HDAC6 is a class IIb cytoplasmic deacetylase with two homologous catalytic domains
making it unique among all other HDACs

30

. HDAC6 is involved in regulating the function

stability, protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction, localization and signaling of cytoplasmic
proteins by deacetylation, an important posttranslational modification. HDAC6 also possesses a
zinc finger motif (ZnF-UBP) that enables it to bind with ubiquitin and thus plays a role in
clearing the misfolded protein aggregates31. The well-studied cytoplasmic substrates of HDAC6
include tubulin, HSP90, cortactin and peroxiredoxins

32-35

. In the nucleus, HDAC6 regulates

expression of genes by interacting with nuclear proteins such as HDAC11, sumoylated p300,
transcriptional repressors such as LCoR, ETO-2

36

and transcription factors RUNX2 and NF-

kappaB 37 38. Studies have shown the role of HDAC6 in variety of biological processes including
metastasis, cell migration, autophagy, and viral infection39,40 41.
Our results in PMA induced K562 cell differentiation to MKs are in line with the recent
studies by Messaoudi et al using CD34+ cells where the results have shown that HDAC6 is
indispensable for proplatelet release from MKs by regulating the acetylation of cytoskeletal
protein, cortactin 25. The study also demonstrated a significant decrease in MK cell number and
Colony forming units (CFU) when CD34+ cells were treated with HDAC6 inhibitor (5µM
Tubastatin A)25. Similarly our results demonstrate reduced MK marker expression in HDAC6
inhibited PMA-treated K562 cells. Therefore our results in the K562 cell line are biologically
meaningful and hold significance as in CD34+ cells. Furthermore, Sardina JL et al. have
demonstrated that the results obtained using K562 cells as megakaryocyte progenitor cells and
the results obtained using CD34+ cells were same and reproducible suggesting the robustness of
the PMA-induced MK differentiation of K562 cell line model system42.

Recent studies have shown that the nuclear HDAC6 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) by suppressing the genes involved in formation of tight junctions 43. In our study also, we
have observed the localization of HDAC6 in the nucleus predominantly, indicating that HDAC6
might be involved in suppression of erythroid lineage genes or regulating the activity or function
of transcription factors. To further probe the role of nuclear HDAC6, we did ChIP-PCR for
GYPA promoter. ChIP-PCR studies confirmed the binding sites of HDAC6 at GYPA promoter
and the enrichment was increased in PMA-treated cells, significantly reduced in the presence of
HDAC6 inhibitor. Interestingly we have observed the enrichment of HDAC6 to GYPA promoter
in control cells (progenitor cells) also suggesting biasedness of MEP cells towards MK lineage
due to the short half life of MK cells (5-7 days) compared to longevity of erythrocytes (120
days). However, further studies are needed to get a deeper insight into the ME-MK biasedness.
HDACs are recruited to the target promoter regions by transcription factors and repressor
proteins, as they do not contain DNA binding domain 44. Further studies are required to find out
the interacting partner of HDAC6 in repressing GYPA. Thus in progenitor cells, GYPA is
expressed at basal level due to the repressors bound to its promoter and repressed completely in
the presence of lineage-specific cytokines or overexpression of lineage specific transcription
factors.
At the molecular level, we have shown upregulation of HDAC6 via ERK1/2 signaling pathway
and the down regulation of MK marker, CD61 when HDAC6 is inhibited or knockdown during
MK differentiation. We have also observed increased expression of CD61 when HDAC6 is
overexpressed in K562 cells giving us a clue that CD61 might be indirectly regulated by
HDAC6. It is established that HDAC6 plays a role in ubiquitination and studies by ChonghuaLi,
et al, have shown that SnoN, an inhibitor of Smad Pathway, is a repressor of CD61 and
undergoes ubiquitination during PMA signaling of MK differentiation45. Furthermore our results
are in line with ChonghuaLi, et al study showing upregulation of MK transcription factors
GATA2 and FOG1. These results indicate presumably that HDAC6 might be the repressor of
repressor (SnoN) of MK-specific transcription factors. Further studies are needed to confirm
these presumptions.
Most of the studies have shown that ROS is required for MK cell commitment, maturation and
for the release of platelets

42,46

. ROS is the upstream regulator in activating the cascade of

signaling proteins and finally leads to the activation of c-JUN, c-FOS, NF-κB transcription
factors, which further regulate the expression of lineage specific genes. Studies have shown that
treatment of cells with antioxidants (Trolox, NAC) inhibited the acquisition of MK
morphological features and reduction in MK marker expression 42. p22phox-dependent NADPH
oxidase is the primary source of ROS production

42

and the inhibition of ROS by antioxidants

hinders MK differentiation from progenitor cells. But it is not clear, out of the four NOX
homologues (NOX1-4), which NOX is responsible for the production of ROS. First time, our
studies have shown that NOX4 is involved in PMA-induced ROS production. Youn GS et al,
have shown that HDAC6 overexpression induces the ROS production by upregulating NADPH
Oxidase in macrophages

47

. In our study, we have observed downregulation of NOX4 when

HDAC6 is inhibited during MK differentiation suggesting that HDAC6 plays important role in
ROS production by regulating NOX4 expression. In astrocytes, crosstalk between HDAC6 and
NOX2 regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators during HIV-1 infection 48. In line
with these results we found downregulation of HDAC6 and NOX4 when ROS is inhibited with
an antioxidant, quercetin during MK differentiation indicating the positive feedback loop
between HDAC6, NOX4 and ROS production. Zhang Y et al found that Aurora-B/AIM-1 and
survivin, the 2 critical mitotic regulators were mislocalized or absent during endomitosis of
mouse MKs49. This was further supported by finding by McCrann et al, who have shown that
NOX4 is required for polyploidazation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) by down
regulating survivin50. Our results have also shown, upregulation of survivin in the presence of
HDAC6 inhibitor, where NOX4 expression was reduced.
In conclusion, our findings provide a new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which
HDAC6 induces sustainable levels of ROS during MK differentiation by upregulating the NOX4
expression, positively regulating the expression of MK lineage transcription factors, GATA2 and
FOG1, MK lineage marker CD61 and repressing erythroid lineage gene GYPA (Fig. 6).
