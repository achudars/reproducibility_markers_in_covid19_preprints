ABSTRACT
Inhibition of the histone methyl-transferase DOT1L (KMT4) has shown encouraging activity in
preclinical models of KMT2A (MLL)-rearranged leukemia. The DOT1L inhibitor pinometostat
(EPZ5676) was well tolerated in early phase clinical trials and showed modest clinical activity,
including occasional complete responses (CRs) as single agent. These studies support the
development of combinatorial therapies for KMT2A-rearranged leukemias. Here, we investigated
two novel combinations: dual inhibition of the histone methyltransferases DOT1L and EZH2, and
the combination of a DOT1L inhibitor with the protein synthesis inhibitor homoharringtonine
(HHR).
EZH2 is the catalytic histone methyltransferase in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2),
and inhibition of EZH2 has reported preclinical activity in KMT2A-rearranged leukemia. We found
that the H3K79 and H3K27 methyl marks are not dependent on each other, and that DOT1L and
EZH2 inhibition affect largely distinct gene expression programs. In particular, the KMT2A/DOT1L
target HOXA9, which is commonly de-repressed as a consequence of PRC2 loss or inhibition in
other contexts, was not re-activated upon dual DOT1L/EZH2 knockout or inhibition. Despite
encouraging data in murine KMT2A-MLLT3 transformed cells suggesting synergy between
DOT1L and EZH2 inhibition, we found both synergistic and antagonistic effects on a panel of
human KMT2A rearranged cell lines. Combinatorial inhibition of DOT1L and EZH2 is thus not a
promising strategy. We identified opposing effects on ribosomal gene transcription and protein
translation by DOT1L and EZH2 as a mechanism that is partially responsible for observed
antagonistic effects. The effects of DOT1L inhibition on ribosomal gene expression prompted us
to evaluate the combination of EPZ5676 with a protein translation inhibitor. EPZ5676 was
synergistic with the protein translation inhibitor homoharringtonine (HHR), supporting further
preclinical/clinical development of this combination.

INTRODUCTION
Rearrangements of KMT2A (MLL1) occur in 10% of AML and ALL, and 70% of infant ALL. With
few exceptions, KMT2A rearrangements are associated with a poor prognosis, and KMT2Arearranged (KMT2A-r) leukemias have been the target of substantial drug development efforts
and clinical research without much impact yet on survival [1]. KMT2A fusions are strongly
transforming [2], likely due to the profound epigenetic changes they induce. Key histone lysine
methyltransferases (KMTs) involved in KMT2A-fusion mediated leukemogenesis are the H3K79
KMT4 (hereafter referred to as DOT1L) [3-6] and the H3K27 KMT6 (hereafter referred to as EZH2)
[7-11]. Both have been proposed as therapeutic targets, and pharmacologic inhibitors for both are
currently in clinical trials (although EZH2 inhibitors are not being studied in AML).
Direct genomic targets of the KMT2A fusion display aberrantly high H3K79 methylation levels
compared with other highly expressed loci [3], and knockdown, knockout, or pharmacologic
inhibition of DOT1L results in the transcriptional downregulation of fusion target gene expression
in KMT2A fusion leukemia models, cells lines and patient samples [3-6]. These findings formed
the basis for two phase I/II clinical trials with the DOT1L inhibitor pinometostat (EPZ5676), as well
as ongoing combination trials with hypomethylating agents and chemotherapy. Pinometostat was
well tolerated and induced single agent responses including two CRs, one of them durable for
many months. However, a substantial number of patients failed to respond, and in others,
resistance rapidly developed [12]. Several mechanisms of resistance have been reported in
model systems since the initiation of these trials. These include classic drug efflux pump
mechanisms (ABCB1A/MDR-1/PGP) [13], epigenetic resistance through downregulation of
SIRT1/SUV39 [14], and independence of H3K79 methylation through unknown mechanisms [13].
Nevertheless, the clinical experience provided proof of concept that DOT1L inhibition had activity
in KMT2A-r disease, with largely non-overlapping toxicities with other agents. A critical next

question is whether synergistic combinations with other agents can be identified that ultimately
improve outcomes for a larger number of patients.
In this study, we investigated the interplay between DOT1L and EZH2 in KMT2A-r AML and ALL
cells. Inhibitors of both, DOT1L and EZH2 have been reported to have single agent efficacy in
models of KMT2A-r leukemia, with different mechanisms of action [1, 3-11]. This raises the
question whether dual inhibition could be additive or synergistic. At the same time, potential
interplay on several levels could also result in antagonistic effects of dual DOT1L/EZH2 inhibition:
DOT1L inhibition results in downregulation of direct KMT2A targets such as the later HOXA
cluster genes. During embryonic and hematopoietic development as well as in several subtypes
of leukemia, the HOXA cluster is silenced and acquires H3K27 tri-methylation by the polycomb
repressive complex 2 (PRC2) [15]. Loss of PRC2 function has been linked to increased HOXA
cluster expression in leukemia [16, 17]. Inhibition of EZH2, the main KMT of the PRC2 complex,
might thus interfere with the silencing of direct KMT2A fusion targets in a manner similar to SIRT1/SUV39 [14]. Furthermore, AF10, a core member of the DOT1L complex and rate limiting cofactor for the di- and tri-methylation of H3K79 [18], was reported to bind unmodified, but not H3K27
methylated H3K27 [19]. Inhibition of H3K27 methylation might thus increase the ability of AF10 to
bind to KMT2A fusion targets and increase H3K79 methylation, resulting in greater difficulty to
achieve profound inhibition of H3K79 methylation. In this study, we set out to answer the following
questions: Does EZH2 inhibition modulate H3K79 methylation? Is EZH2/PRC2 required for the
silencing of KMT2A fusion direct target genes upon DOT1L inhibition? Is dual DOT1L/EZH2
inhibition synergistic or antagonistic in KMT2A-fusion driven leukemia?
In brief, we found that the combination of DOT1L /EZH2 inhibition induced pleiotropic and context
dependent effects, and did not consistently synergize with each other. However, these studies
identified previously underappreciated effects of these inhibitors on protein translation and
suggest that protein translation inhibition acts synergistic with DOT1L inhibition.

METHODS:
For primer sequences, antibodies and detailed experimental procedures please refer to the
supplemental materials.
Cell lines: Human leukemia cell lines were obtained from ATCC or DSMZ and maintained in
culture as detailed in the supplemental materials. Cell lines were re-authenticated every 6
months in culture.
Drug Assays: Compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and all dilution series were prepared
keeping the DMSO exposure euqal accross all conditions and at <0.1% (<1:1000). Human
leukemia cell lines were exposed to EPZ4777, EPZ5676 (DOT1L inhibitor), GSK 126 (EZH2
Inhibitor) or homoharringtonine (HHT) at the indicated concentrations, and cells were replated at
equal densities in fresh compound containing media every 3-4 days. Cell growth and viability
was assessed either by serial replating and trypan blue exclusion, or XTT assay.
Dot1l and Ezh2 knockout mice, breeding: Animals were maintained at the Animal Research
Facility at the University of Colorado and Boston Children’s Hospital. Animal experiments were
approved by the Internal Animal Care and Use Committee. Dot1l [3] and Ezh2 ([7]) conditional
knockout mice were previously described and were maintained on a C57BL/6 background.
Generation of transformed murine cells: Ecotropic retroviral vectors containing murine
KMT2A-MLLT3-IRES-GFP, Cre-IRES-pTomato (Cre) and MSCV-IRES-pTomato (MIT) were
generated by cotransfection of 293 cells. Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSC) cells were transduced with
KMT2A-MLLT3-GFP. After 2-7 days, GFP+ cells were sorted and transduced with Cre or control.
2-3 days after transduction, cells were sorted and plated in colony assays or liquid culture.
Biochemical Assays (cell growth, colony growth, apoptosis, cell cycle, western blotting):
For colony assays, sorted transduced cells were plated in methylcellulose M3234 containing IL3,
IL6 and SCF at 1000 cells per plate in duplicate, and colonies were scored after 7 days of culture.

For liquid culture of murine cells, cells were maintained in media with cytokine support, and
replated every 2-3 days. Dot1l and Ezh2 deletion was verified by PCR at each replating beyond
day 7. Cell growth and viability were followed by serial cell counts using Trypan blue exclusion.
Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were performed using the Annexin-staining and the Click-IT
EdU kit. Protein translation was analyzed using the Click-IT OP-Puro kit. Western blotting for
histone modifications was performed on purified histones isolated by acid extraction using the
indicated antibodies and controls.
Histone Mass Spectrometry: Histones were isolated, chemically derivatized and analyzed by
mass spectrometry as previously described [20].
qPCR analysis of HOXA9 and CDKN2A: RNA was isolated from sorted murine transformed
progenitor cells or compound treated human cell lines using RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen).
Please refer to the supplement for primer sequences. Fold-change of is shown compared
vehicle treated control (human cell lines) or wild type control (murine knockout studies).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP): Chromatin immunoprecipitation for H3K79me2 and
H3K27me3 in murine KMT2A-MLLT3 leukemias was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies
from abcam (ab3594 Cambridge, MA) similarly as described [21].
RNA amplification and RNA-Seq: RNA was isolated from MV4;11 cells exposed to 7 days of
EPZ5676 or GSK126 using RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen). RNA for RNA-Seq was submitted to
the UC-Denver genomics core for library preparation and sequencing.
Data analysis and statistical methods : Histone PTMs were analyzed using the EpiProfile 2.0
computational algorithm [22]. Drug interactions were evaluated for synergy or antagonism using
CompuSyn (http://www.combosyn.com/) [23, 24]. RNA-Seq raw Fastq files were aligned using
STAR [25] against Human GRCh37 reference and quantified by applying Kallisto [version 0.45.0,
PMID: 27043002]. Output from Kallisto was then directly imported into DESeq2 [26] in order to
detect differentially expressed genes (DEG). DEGs were deemed as genes with False Discovery
Rate (FDR) less than 0.05 level.

RESULTS:
No interplay between H3K27 and H3K79 methylation.
In order to assess whether inhibition of EZH2 affects H3K79 methylation (or DOT1L inhibition
impacted H3K27 methylation), we exposed the KMT2A rearranged cell line MV4;11 to small
molecule inhibitors of DOT1L or EZH2 (Figure 1A). Western blotting over a wide range of inhibitor
doses revealed no changes of H3K79 methylation upon inhibition of EZH2, or H3K27 methylation
upon inhibition of DOT1L. Results were confirmed by mass spectrometry (Figure 1B) at a fixed
dose in an extended cell line panel. Despite a higher availability of H3K27 unmodified histones
that could serve as binding sites for AF10 [19], H3K79 methylation is not increased upon inhibition
of EZH2.
Synergy between DOT1L and EZH2 deletion in murine KMT2A-MLLT3 (MLL-AF9)
transformed bone marrow cells.
We next asked if dual knockout of Dot1l and Ezh2 would act synergistic or antagonistic in a
defined genetic mouse model driven by MLL-AF9 (KMT2A-MLLT3). MLL-AF9 was retrovirally
introduced into lin- cKit+ Sca-1+ (LSK) cells from mice carrying conditional alleles for Dot1l and/or
Ezh2. Deletion of either Dot1l or Ezh2 alone resulted in smaller and more differentiated colonies
(which we previously showed to be devoid of replating capacity, therefore colonies were not
replated). Dual inactivation of Dot1l and Ezh2 resulted in a near complete failure to yield any
colony formation (Figure 2A), and particularly rapid outgrowth of cells that had failed to undergo
complete deletion of the Ezh2 allele (Figure 2B). Transcriptionally, inactivation of Ezh2 was
accompanied by de-repression of Cdkn2a, which was independent of Dot1l and H3K79
methylation. In turn, HoxA9 expression was decreased upon loss of Dot1l, which was not rescued

by concomitant loss of Ezh2 (Figure 2C). Consistent with these results, ChIP-qPCR of the later
HoxA cluster showed no substantial increase in H3K27 trimethylation 5 days after Dot1l deletion,
while HoxA9 expression was already profoundly decreased. We therefore conclude that PRC2 is
not the primary mechanism by which the HoxA cluster is silenced upon loss or inhibition of DOT1L.
DOT1L and EZH2 inhibition results in both synergistic and antagonistic effects in human
cell lines.
Our data in the murine conditional knockout system suggest potential synergy between
inactivation of DOT1L and EZH2 at high doses, mediated by de-repression of CDKN2A. We
therefore asked whether dual inhibition of DOT1L and EZH2 would act synergistic in a panel of
cell lines with intact or deleted CDKN2A locus (Figure 3A and S1, mutational information from
ATCC, DSMZ and CCLE). Molm14, Monomac6, MV4;11 and THP1cells were exposed to a range
of difference concentrations of DOT1L and EZH2 inhibitor alone or in combination. We observed
strong synergy in Molm14 and Monomac6 cells (Figure 3B), and moderate to strong antagonism
in MV4;11 and THP1 cells (Figure 3C). Thus, CDKN2A status did not correlate with synergy
versus antagonism in the human cell lines. As in the murine system, the expression of KMT2Afusion target genes was not affected by inhibition of EZH2. The substantial antagonistic effects
between DOT1L and EZH2 inhibition in half the cell lines tested suggest that this is not a
combination that should be pursued clinically.
DOT1L and EZH2 inhibitors have opposing effects on the transcription of ribosomal genes.
The antagonism of DOT1L and EZH2 in MV4;11 cells was particularly striking. We therefore
performed RNA-Seq to investigate potential mechanisms of antagonism. Samples with dual
inhibition clustered separate from single inhibition, but were closer to DOT1L than EZH2 exposed
samples (Figure 4A). Principal component analysis revealed that, for the most part, DOT1L and
EZH2 act on distinct, non-overlapping gene sets (Figure 4B). H3K79me2 (catalyzed by DOT1L)
is associated with actively transcribed genes, while H3K27me3 (catalyzed by EZH2) is associated

with silencing. In order to interrogate which pathway(s) might be responsible for the observed
antagonistic effects, we therefore focused on genes that were downregulated upon DOT1L
inhibition, de-repressed upon EZH2 inhibition, and normalized upon dual inhibition. The gene set
in cluster 1 and 5 follows this pattern (Figure 4C+D, red and light blue cluster/line). KEGG pathway
analysis showed that this gene set is highly enriched for ribosomal genes (Figure 4E). In fact, a
role for PRC2 in repressing Polymerase II transcribed RNA transcription (rRNAs, tRNAs) has
been previously documented [27].
DOT1L inhibition reduced protein translation.
We next asked whether DOT1L inhibition reduced protein translation in MV4;11 cells. Protein
translation was measured by incorporation of OP-Puro and found to be affected by DOT1L
inhibition (Figure 5A). The rate of protein translation is different in different phases of the cell
cycle, and we and others showed decreased cycling as one of the most prominent effects of
DOT1L inhibition or deletion. We therefore chose a very early time point, and measured cell cycle
distribution at the same time as protein translation. In fact, decreases in protein translation were
one of the earliest effects measured when exposing MV4;11 cells to DOT1L inhibition (Figure 5A),
occurring before any substantial effects on cell cycle (Figure 5B), and at a dose much lower than
doses that affect HOXA cluster expression (compare to Figure 3D). EZH2 inhibition not only
rescued ribosomal gene expression (Figure 4), but also partially rescued protein synthesis (Figure
5C). The antagonism between DOT1L and EZH2 inhibitors in MV4;11 cells may thus in part be
driven by their opposing effects on ribosomal gene expression and, as a consequence, protein
translation.

translation inhibitor. We first asked whether Inhibitory effects on protein translation were observed
across all KMT2A-rearranged cell lines used in this study, and found this to be the case (Figure
5D),. Non-KMT2A-rearranged control cell lines were not affected (Figure 5D).

The protein

translation inhibitor homoharringtonine (omacetaxine) was FDA approved for chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) in 2012 [28, 29]. It also has published preclinical activity in several AML models
and small clinical trials [30-32]. We exposed two KM2A-rearranged AML cell lines (MV4;11,
Molm14) to 4-7 days of EPZ5676, followed by exposure to EPZ5676 and HHR. We found the dual
inhibition to be synergistic, suggesting that decreased ribosomal gene expression upon DOT1L
inhibition sensitized leukemia cells to the effect of a protein translation inhibitor.

DISCUSSION:
In this study, we set out to interrogate the interplay between DOT1L and PRC2 inhibition in
KMT2A-rearranged leukemias. We discovered that:
H3K27 and H3K79 methylation do not affect each other. Despite a potential rationale that
modulation of H3K27 methylation might affect H3K79 methylation via binding of AF10 [19], we
find no such effect over a wide range of doses of the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126. Furthermore, our
results are consistent with the previously reported lack of effects of DOT1L loss or inhibition on
H3K27me3 [3, 4].
The polycomb repressive complex 2 is not responsible for silencing the HOXA cluster in
KMT2A-fusion driven leukemia. Despite a clear role of PRC2 mediated silencing of the HOXA
cluster in other contexts, the HOXA cluster does not acquire H3K27 methylation in a time frame
consistent with a primary silencing mechanism. Furthermore, dual inhibition/inactivation of DOT1L
and EZH2 does not rescue HOXA cluster expression. These results were consistent across the
murine retroviral model as well as human cell lines. Given the well documented regulation of the

HOXA by PRC2 during development and in the context of other subtypes of leukemia, our data
is highly relevant in that is suggests a more complex and context dependent regulation of the
HOXA cluster than previously appreciated.
The polycomb repressive complex 2 is not responsible for silencing the CDKN2A in human
KMT2A-rearranged cell lines. CDKN2A is a major canonical target of PRC2. Although CDKN2A
independent effects of loss of PRC2 on leukemogenesis have been reported [33], de-repression
of CDKN2A was described as a major mechanism for the anti-leukemic effect of PRC2
inactivation [7, 9]. In the murine model, persistent downregulation of the KMT2A-fusion target
HOXA9 and simultaneous de-repression of CDKN2A provide a good potential mechanism for the
observed synergy between inactivation of DOT1L and EZH2. However, synergistic versus
antagonistic effects in a panel of human cell lines did not correlate with CDKN2A status, and in
cells with an intact CDKN2A locus no de-repression was observed upon inhibition of EZH2.
Inhibition of DOT1L affects ribosomal gene expression, protein translation, and sensitized
KMT2A-rearranged cell lines to homoharringtonine. More in depth analysis of the antagonistic
effects between DOT1L and EZH2 inhibition in MV4;11 cells revealed that EZH2 inhibition
mediates resistance to DOT1L inhibition through partial rescue of ribosomal gene expression and
protein translation. With respect to EZH2, our data is consistent with the previously reported effect
of PRC2 on Polymerase III transcribed non-translated RNA gene transcription [27]. Furthermore,
we found that DOT1L inhibition resulted in decreased protein synthesis in KMT2A-rearranged
AML cell lines. This resulted in sensitization to the effect of the protein translation inhibitor HHR.
A wealth of preclinical data as well as several clinical trials [30-32] support HHR as an active
agent in AML. Our data suggests that the combination of DOT1L inhibition with HHR merits further
investigation, with the potential for rapid clinical translation given that HHR is FDA.
