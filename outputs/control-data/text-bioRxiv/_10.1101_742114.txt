Abstract
Blueberry plants require large quantities of pollen deposited on stigmas to produce commercialquality fruit. Like many agricultural crops, the interaction between pollen-source variety and pollenrecipient variety can be a major determinant of fruit quality in blueberries. However, little
information exists to guide growers in optimising fruit set and quality. Using five commonly grown
blueberry varieties, I determined whether crossing between varieties (inter-varietal) increased fruit
mass and decreased developmental time relative to crossing within a variety (intra-varietal), and if
so, what the best crossing combinations are. While intra-varietal pollination often produced fruit, for
certain varieties the fruit set and fruit mass were highly reduced compared to inter-varietal
pollination. Furthermore, intra-varietal pollination resulted in longer fruit developmental time in
comparison to pollination between varieties. For the same pollen-recipient variety, inter-varietal
crosses typically outperformed intra-varietal crosses in fruit mass and developmental time; however,
the extent to which inter-varietal crosses outperformed intra-varietal crosses differed between
pollen-donor varieties. This result suggests that combinations of varieties are not trivial as some
inter-varietal combinations may outperform others. Furthermore, some varieties appear to be more
susceptible to the negative effects of intra-varietal crosses than others and that less susceptible
varieties may be better suited to conditions where pollinator movement is poor. While our study can
guide growers in determining optimal co-planting schemes for the varieties tested, for example in
South Africa where these varieties are frequently grown. It also serves as a blueprint for similar
compatibility studies that can easily be performed prior to planting to determine the best intervarietal combinations.

Introduction
Agriculture is continually focused on improving yields, but crops are persistently barraged with a
range of problems including pests (Isman, 2000; Kumar et al., 2008), lack of nutrients (Parikh and
James, 2012), and droughts (Bodner et al., 2015), that may reduce yield or even induce crop failure
(Mendelsohn, 2007). Growers therefore persistently seek innovative ways to improve pest-control,
plant nutrition, and irrigation to overcome these problems and increase yields (Bodner et al., 2015;
Isman, 2000; Kumar et al., 2008; Mueller et al., 2012). Yet, even when fertigation and pest-control
are ideally managed, many crops may still fail to produce optimal yields if they are not adequately
pollinated (Broussard et al., 2017; Fijen et al., 2018). Growers of animal-pollinated crops therefore
need to manage an additional dimension of crop production—pollination services—to ensure that
enough of the correct pollen lands on recipient stigmas (Eaton and Nams, 2012; Gaines-Day and
Gratton, 2016; Stern et al., 2001).
The simplest intervention to increase crop yields through pollination is to increase pollinator
numbers (Eaton and Nams, 2012; Gaines-Day and Gratton, 2016; Stern et al., 2001). For example,
Stern et al., (2001) found doubling honey bee hives caused an increase in the number of honey bee
foragers leading to increased fruit set and yield of ‘Red Delicious’ apple trees by 50–100%. However,
increasing hive numbers does not always result in greater yields: Eaton and Nams., (2012) found that
increasing bee hive density caused an increase in fruit set and yield in blueberries but only to a point.
This suggests that at a certain level of abundance, further investment to increase pollinator numbers
may be met with diminishing returns on yield (Thomson, 2003) (Fig. 1.1). Thus, although increasing
pollinator numbers is often one of the first means employed to increase low fruit yields, it is easy to
over-shoot on this solution and it is important to understand where and when the point of
diminishing returns is reached.

Fig 1.1: Hypothetical relationship between fruit yield and the quantity of pollinators for high and low pollination quality. A)
Increasing pollinator numbers is likely to have a marked positive effect on yields until most stigmas are saturated with
pollen (point X). Thereafter, additional increases in pollinator numbers are expected to progressively result in smaller and
smaller yield increases until all stigmas are saturated with pollen (point Y). The area between points X and Y (B) is the area
of diminishing returns with increased investment in pollinators. C) After this point, the addition of more pollinators will not
increase yields, however yields can be increased by increasing the quality of pollen receipt (red curve versus blue curve). In
fact, increases in pollen quality have the potential to increase yields across the entire spectrum of pollinator numbers.
Furthermore, low numbers of pollinators, carrying high quality pollen may generate similar yields to high numbers of
pollinators carrying low quality pollen (dotted line Z).

The second method of increasing crop yields through pollination is to improve the quality of pollen
reaching stigmas, rather than the quantity. In many crops, fruit quality and yield vary depending on
the source of pollen, i.e., pollen from the same variety (intra-variety pollination) or pollen from
different varieties (inter-variety pollination). For example, ‘Red delicious’ apples require intervarietal pollination to produce fruit (Stern et al., 2001) as most varieties are self-incompatible.

Similarly in dates, fruit set, weight, maturity and marketable yield are all affected by pollen source
(Rezazadeh et al., 2013). Importantly, increasing the quality of pollen can have positive effects on
yields, even when further increases in pollinator numbers have negligible effects on yield (Fig 1).
Blueberry fruit quality is directly affected by pollen source, where inter-varietal pollination often
positively affects fruit size, weight, and developmental time when compared to pollination within
varieties (Bell et al., 2012; Dogterom et al., 2000; Ehlenfeldt, 2001; Gupton and Spiers, 1994;
Harrison et al., 1993; Huang et al., 1997; Müller et al., 2013; Taber and Olmstead, 2016; Usui et al.,
2005). In response to this constraint, growers often plant different varieties in adjacent rows in an
orchard in attempt to increase yield through inter-varietal pollination. While inter-varietal
pollination is likely to increase yield, varieties may differ in their compatibility with each other.
Knowing which varieties should be planted together is thus of crucial importance to growers.
Despite this, very few multi-variety compatibility studies exist to guide growers in deciding which
varieties to co-plant.
In this paper, I investigate the interactive effects of pollen origin and pollen recipient on fruit yields
for some of the most commonly planted blueberry varieties, especially in South Africa. This will help
blueberry growers to optimize inter-varietal planting beyond simply planting two different varieties
together. First, I determined whether inter-varietal pollination generally increases fruit mass relative
to intra-varietal pollination. I then asked whether there were ideal combinations of varieties which
maximize fruit production and yield. I hypothesized that inter-varietal pollination would result in
significantly larger yields than crossing within varieties. I also expect that yields will be significantly
affected by the choice of recipient and donor pairs.

Methods and materials
Study site
This study was conducted in an experimental blueberry plot in Klapmuts (Western Cape, South
Africa, 33°49'42.5"S 18°55'03.5"E). The experimental plot was stocked at a density of 10 honey bee
hives per hectare.

Varieties and experimental design
I conducted a series of hand pollinations between concurrently flowering blueberry varieties,
Emerald, Eureka, Snowchaser, Suziblue and Twilight. Emerald and Eureka were the first varieties to
bloom, followed by Snowchaser, Suziblue and the Twilight. Pollination for each variety was
conducted at 25% bloom. Therefore, varieties such as Emerald and Eureka could be pollen donors to
all varieties but not recipients to all varieties. Each possible pollination combination for each variety
(i.e., crosses within varieties and between varieties that overlap in flowering period, see Table 1.1)
was replicated across nine plants, with each pollination combination repeated three times per
individual plant. This yielded a total of 27 replicates per pollination combination. Since blueberry
plants of the same variety are clones, I did not expect variation between plants to strongly affect our
results. In addition, by using fewer individual plants, but with repetition within plants, I was able to
conduct my experiments across varieties within a small unit of space (experimental plot size: 50 m X
115 m). This approach reduced variation in external factors that may influence fruit development
(e.g. soil nutrition, moisture and irrigation, and exposure to sunlight and wind) that typically vary in
situ across large-scale multi-variety plantings.

not overlap in flowering time. Emerald and Eureka were the first varieties to bloom, followed by Snowchaser, Suziblue and
the Twilight. All pollinations were conducted when a variety was at 25% flowering. Varieties could therefore be donors to

Hand-pollination protocol
To ensure that experimental flowers were virgins, buds that were about to open were bagged three
days before hand pollination. The day before pollination, I collected pollen from pollen donor
flowers (approximately five flowers per pollen application) (Dogterom et al., 2000). Pollen was
extracted from donor flowers by removing the corolla with a scalpel and agitating the anthers with
forceps, causing the poricidal anthers to release pollen that I collected in a Petri dish. Prior to handpollination, recipient flowers were marked and emasculated. I did this by removing all stamens with
a pair of fine forceps, ensuring that no self-pollination could take place. After removing anthers, I
checked stigmas with a 20x hand lens to ensure no pollen deposition occurred. I mixed pollen from
donor flowers on different individual plants to ensure that recipient flowers received pollen from
multiple donors. I dipped recipient stigmas into this pollen mix and visually confirmed that the
stigma was saturated with pollen. To prevent honey bees from depositing additional pollen of
unknown origin onto the stigma I placed a fine mesh bag over hand-pollinated flowers following
hand-pollination. Once flowers wilted, I removed their bags.

Fruit quality variables
After hand pollinations were conducted, I checked fruit development weekly to determine whether
fruit were mature (the entire fruit had turned a uniform dark blue) and ready for fruit-quality
measurements. I harvested and weighed mature fruit by hand. I also measured the diameter of each
fruit on the day it was harvested. The developmental time for each fruit (the number of weeks from
pollination to harvesting) for each donor–recipient pair was also determined. Similar to fruit mass
and diameter, the developmental time is a significant determinant of fruit value, because early fruit
are more valuable than late fruit, since early fruit can be sold at higher prices when market demand
is not saturated (Dogterom et al., 2000; Sobekova et al., 2013). I also calculated the percentage fruit
set per donor–recipient pair. I combined fruit mass and percentage fruit set for donor-recipient pair i
to calculate the adjusted fruit mass (i.e. a proxy for realised yield) for donor–recipient pair i as
follows:
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖 = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 × 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖

(Equation 1)

Statistical analyses
I used linear mixed-effects models with fruit mass, diameter, developmental time and adjusted fruit
mass as a function of donor–recipient pair (fixed effect). I allowed the model to vary in both slope
and intercept (without covariance) per plant ID to account for variation among individual plants
(plant ID as a random effect), thus allowing the model more sensitivity to detect differences in fruit
quality measures as a result of donor–recipient pair in isolation. Linear contrasts (Tukey) were used
to test differences between donor–recipient pairs. To assess model fit to our data, I used Nakagawa
R2 values (Nakagawa and Schielzeth, 2013), which provides both conditional variance (R2c) and
marginal variance (R2m) estimates for linear mixed-effects models that can be equated to traditional
R2 values. Conditional R2 values (R2c) reflect the variance explained by the entire model (fixed effects

and random effects), whereas marginal R2 values (R2m) indicate the variance explained by the fixed
effects alone.

Inter- vs. intra-varietal pollination
To determine whether inter-varietal pollination was beneficial to blueberry production, I grouped
inter-varietal pollination combinations by recipient variety and compared overall fruit quality
resulting from inter-varietal pollination to intra-varietal pollinations for that variety. I used the same
linear mixed-effects model approach for this comparison, but with adjusted fruit mass as a function
of intra- vs inter-varietal pollination (fixed effect). As above, I allowed the model to vary in both
slope and intercept (without covariance) per plant ID to account for variation among individual
plants (plant ID as a random effect). Since there were only two levels for the fixed effect, I compared
model estimates for intra- vs inter-varietal pollination directly and assessed model fit to our data
using Nakagawa R2 values (Nakagawa and Schielzeth, 2013).
All statistical analyses were conducted in R (version 3.3.2) (R Core Team, 2017) using the packages
nlme (Pinheiro et al., 2017), multcomp (Hothorn et al., 2008), ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009), sjPlot
(Lüdecke, 2017), car (Fox and Weisberg, 2011), lme4 (Bates et al., 2015), grid (R Core Team, 2017),
gridExtra (Auguie, 2017), lattice (Deepayan, 2008), MuMIn (Barton, 2017), plyr (Wickham, 2011) and
plotrix (Lemon, 2006).

Results
Inter- vs. intra-varietal pollination
Inter-varietal pollination resulted in larger fruit for Suziblue and Twilight, but not for Emerald, Eureka
and Snowchaser. Inter-varietal pollination consistently resulted in a heavier adjusted fruit mass
compared to intra-varietal pollination. Developmental time was largely unaffected by pollen source,
except in the case of Suziblue and Twilight. Below, I discuss the results of our experiments in depth.

Across all varieties, inter-varietal pollination significantly (z=4.3580, p<0.001; Fig 1.2) increased

time as within variety pollination (mean ± SE weeks = 13 weeks ± 0.36 weeks, mean ± SE weeks = 13
weeks ± 0.55 weeks respectively; Fig 1.3).
Plant ID explained most of the variance in fruit mass compared to donor–recipient pairs, since the
conditional variance for the fruit mass model was R2c=0.6942 (fixed- and random-effects). This was
largely different to the marginal variance (fixed-effects only: R2m=0.1927). Inter-varietal pollinations
using Emerald pollen significantly increased (z= 3.8720, p<0.001; see Table S1) the fruit mass of
Suziblue by 38% to (mean ± SE fruit mass = 1.43 g ± 0.14 g). I did not detect a significant difference in
fruit mass for Eureka x Suziblue (z= 0.5940, p=0.9322; see Table S1) and Twilight x Suziblue (z=
1.9910, p=0.1862; see Table S1) compared to intra-varietal pollination, with the average (± SE) fruit
mass resulting from inter-varietal pollinations with Eureka (1.10 g ± 0.14 g) and Twilight (1.13 g ±
0.10 g) only 6% and 9% higher respectively than for Suziblue x Suziblue pollinations (1.04 g ± 0.07 g;
Fig 1.3).

Emerald pollen and Snowchaser pollen resulted in a significantly shorter developmental time of 10

(mean ± SE weeks; z= -5.5930, p<0.001; see Table S2), respectively. This was on average 2 weeks
shorter than pollinating Twilight with its own pollen which had a ripening time of 12 weeks ± 0.43
weeks (mean ± SE weeks). I was unable to detect any difference in developmental time between

pollinating Twilight with other Twilight pollen or Eureka pollen as Eureka also had a developmental
time of 12 weeks (z= -0.6950, p=0.8990; see Table S2).
Plant ID explained most of the variance in fruit mass compared to donor–recipient pairs, since the
conditional variance for the fruit mass model was R2c=0.3132 (fixed- and random-effects). This was
largely different to the marginal variance (fixed-effects only: R2m=0.1375). Pollinating Twilight plants
with pollen from other varieties significantly increased fruit mass in all donor–recipient pairs except
Eureka (z= 1.503, p=0.4299; see Table S2; Fig 1.4). Pollinating Twilight with Emerald pollen resulted
in the greatest fruit mass at 3.1 g ± 0.46 g (mean ± SE fruit mass) compared to Twilight plants
pollinated with other Twilight pollen, a ca. 100% increase (z=2.7940, p=0.0259; see Table S2).
Pollinating Twilight with Suziblue pollen also substantially increased fruit mass by 70% (z= 2.8770,
p=0.0202; see Table S2) to 2.7 g ± 0.20 g (mean ± SE fruit mass).

The lack of influence of donor–recipient pair (fixed effect) on developmental time is further
supported by linear contrasts, which revealed no significant difference between donor–recipient
pairs (z= -0.3570, p=0.7210; see Table S3). However, the average (± SE) developmental time resulting
from inter-varietal pollination with Eureka (12 weeks ± 0.76 weeks) was one week shorter than
Emerald x Emerald pollinations (13 weeks ± 0.59 weeks; Fig 1.5)—the direction (shorter
developmental times for inter-varietal pollination) is consistent with expectations.

Donor–recipient pairs explained all of the variance in fruit mass compared to plant ID, since the
conditional variance for the fruit mass model was R2c=0.0179 (fixed- and random-effects), and the
marginal variance (fixed-effects only: R2m=0.0179); however, donor-recipient pair still explained a
very small proportion of the overall variation in fruit mass. While I was unable to detect a significant
difference in fruit mass between these donor–recipient pairs (z=0.7761, p=0.4380; see Table S3), the
average (± SE) fruit mass resulting from inter-varietal pollinations with Eureka (1.62 g ± 0.16 g) was
12% higher than for Emerald x Emerald pollinations (1.46g ± 0.15 g, Fig. 1.5). The direction of this
difference (increased mass for inter-varietal pollination) is consistent with expectations.

weeks ± 0.36 weeks (mean ± SE weeks; Fig 1.6). Pollinating Eureka with Emerald pollen also resulted
in a developmental time of 9 weeks ± 0.26 weeks (mean ± SE weeks; Fig 1.6).
Plant ID explained most of the variance in fruit mass compared to donor–recipient pairs, since the
conditional variance for the fruit mass model was R2c=0.5211 (fixed- and random-effects). This was
largely different to the marginal variance (fixed-effects only: R2m=0.0683). I was unable to detect a
substantial difference in fruit mass between Emerald x Eureka (z=2.0960, p=0.0894; see Table S4)
and Snowchaser x Eureka (z= 1.835, p= 0.1563; see Table S2). However, the average (± SE) fruit mass
resulting from inter-varietal pollinations with Emerald (4.42 g ± 0.36g) and Snowchaser (4.19g ±
0.29g) was 25% and 18% higher respectively than for intra-varietal pollinations of Eureka (3.54 g ±
0.36g; Fig 1.6). Our level of replication may be the reason why the difference is too small to be
statistically detected, however, the direction (increased mass for inter-varietal pollination) is
consistent with our expectations.

could not detect a significant difference in developmental time between these donor–recipient pairs

Discussion
This study revealed a general trend of crosses within varieties producing lower adjusted fruit masses
than crosses between varieties. Furthermore, differences in the source of pollen can affect both fruit
mass and developmental time of multiple blueberry varieties. Inter-varietal pollination significantly
increased fruit mass for Suziblue and Twilight and decreased developmental time. These differences
in fruit mass among inter-varietal pollinations have real-world implications for growers and
underscores the importance of compatibility research in agriculture to assist growers in decisions to
co-plant different varieties.
I show that blueberry varieties Emerald, Eureka, Snowchaser, Suziblue, and Twilight can all produce
fruit after intra-varietal pollinations. This means that varieties can be planted in solid block plantings
and still produce fruit. However, despite Emerald, Eureka and Snowchaser not yielding significantly
larger fruit for inter-varietal compared to intra-varietal pollinations, the direction of these
differences was always consistent (inter-varietal pollinations always increased adjusted fruit mass)
(Fig 1.2). This suggests that the effect sizes may have been too small to pick up using the level of
replication in this study and it may take extremely large sample sizes to detect significant treatment
differences for some of these varieties. Nevertheless, the consistency of the effect direction (intervarietal crosses yield greater fruit mass than intra-varietal crosses, Fig. 1.2) suggests that it is
prudent to interplant whenever possible. Other studies have also shown that fruit mass can be
increased when varieties are pollinated with pollen from other varieties (Bell et al., 2012; Harrison et
al., 1993; Müller et al., 2013; Taber and Olmstead, 2016). In this study, the degree of benefit from
inter-varietal pollen appeared to differ between varieties and while absolute positive effects were
always detected, these were often not statistically significant. For Suziblue and Twilight, intervarietal pollination also led to significant reductions in developmental time. Inter-varietal pollination
has also been shown to decrease developmental time in other blueberry varieties such as Bluecrop,
Bluegold, Legacy, Sierra, Toro and Patriot (Dogterom et al., 2000; Ehlenfeldt, 2001; Gupton and

Spiers, 1994; Mackenzie, 1997; Müller et al., 2013; Taber and Olmstead, 2016). Choosing the correct
pollen source appears to be especially important for varieties such as Eureka, Suziblue and Twilight
as pollen quality is likely to have large consequences for yields and interplanting varieties to
promote outcrossing therefore seems to be the best strategy for increased fruit mass and decreased
developmental times. In contrast, varieties Snowchaser and Emerald appear to be slightly less
affected by pollen source and may be better suited to conditions where pollinators seldom move
between varieties.
While this study used hand-pollinations to optimise pollination conditions actual pollinators are
more likely to deposit mixed pollen loads. Consequently, even with good pollinator movement
between varieties, animal pollination is unlikely to achieve the fruit quality recorded in this study.
Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that pollinator movement between varieties is likely to
increase yields for many commercial blueberry varieties. However, there is little to no data available
on how frequently pollinators move between varieties, and how position, spacing and the identity of
varieties and pollinator species are likely to affect probabilities of pollen movement between
varieties. This represents a fertile area for future study.
While many farms attempt to maximize the chances of pollen movement between cross-compatible
varieties by planting different varieties in rows, it is unclear how frequently pollinators actually move
between rows. By studying pollinator behaviour, I may improve spacing or placement of blueberry
plants, to increase outcrossing. This may be done by matching planting structure with pollinator
movement. For example, if a pollinator often moves between rows in a blueberry orchard, then
varieties can be planted next to each other in rows because this may improve the chances of
pollinator movement from donors to recipients and vice versa. However, if pollinators mostly move
down rows and varieties are planted next to each other, varieties will be pollinated with pollen from
different plants of the same variety. Improving spacing, or placement of blueberry plants may
