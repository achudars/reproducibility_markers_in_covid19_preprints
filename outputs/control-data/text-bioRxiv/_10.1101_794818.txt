ABSTRACT
Promoting diversity and inclusiveness in the STEM academic workforce remains a key challenge and national priority.
Scientific societies can play a significant role in this process through the creation and implementation of programs to foster
STEM academic workforce diversification, and by providing mentoring and skills development training that empower
scientists from under-represented minority (URM) backgrounds to succeed in their communities of practice. In this article,
we provide examples of challenges met by scientific societies in these areas and present data from the American Society for
Cell Biology, highlighting the benefits received by trainees through long-term engagement with its programs. The success of
these initiatives illustrates the impact of discipline-specific programming by scientific societies in supporting the
development of URM scientists and an increasingly diverse and inclusive academic STEM community.

INTRODUCTION
The effort to create a diverse and inclusive academic biomedical workforce in the United States continues to face
significant challenges. At present, under-represented minority (URM) scientists constitute only 3-4% of medical school basic
science tenure-track faculty in Association of American Medical Colleges member institutions, a disproportionately small
group in comparison to the ~32% of the U.S. population that are URM (1). Another disparity exists with regard to gender, as
women have earned the majority of biomedical Ph.D. degrees from U.S. institutions since 2008, yet represent only one-third
of NIH-funded principal investigators (2, 3). While URM and well-represented (WR) trainees are equally likely to
matriculate in and complete doctoral programs and to obtain postdoctoral positions, recent analyses indicate that two major
bottlenecks exist on the path to becoming faculty: URMs exhibit higher attrition rates during both undergraduate education
and in the transition from postdoctoral to junior faculty positions (1, 4). Importantly, although the number of URM Ph.D.
graduates increased 9.3-fold between 1980 and 2013, this did not translate into greater representation at the faculty level (4).
These observations suggest that merely increasing the total number of URM Ph.D. recipients is unlikely to have a major
impact on the proportion of URM biomedical faculty, a conclusion supported by computer modeling of the academic
biomedical training and hiring landscape (4). Interventions will likely be necessary across the career trajectory – and
particularly at the postdoc-to-faculty transition – to improve representation of URM scientists in the professoriate (1, 4).
More URMs in the professoriate may ultimately lead to increased amounts of role models and mentors for the next
generation of URM scientists and professors, which will likely have a positive impact on the recruitment and retention of a
diverse STEM workforce (5-8).
In several ways, discipline-focused scientific societies are well-positioned to catalyze these interventions and
support the professional development of URM researchers. Unlike individual degree programs or postdoctoral positions,
scientific societies provide longitudinally stable touchstones for individual scientists across their training and career
trajectories, from the undergraduate to senior faculty stages. Societies often assist scientists in obtaining admission to
graduate programs or postdoctoral positions, writing grant proposals, publishing research, and presenting their work through
poster and oral presentations (9). Unlike individual universities, societies help unite geographically distant scientists and can
promote cross-institutional collaborations, networking, mentoring, and career opportunities, benefits that may be particularly
impactful for women and URM researchers (9). Given these characteristics, scientific societies can be considered
communities of practice (C of P), gathering individuals with similar interests to learn from one another and improve their
fields (10). It is often the case that these C of P have explicit or implicit requirements for bona fide membership, such as
evidenced mastery of a set of skills, abilities, and accomplishments (11). And, although societies can sometimes be

inequitable or unwelcoming environments for women and URM researchers (10-15), they are also capable of remedying
these problems themselves (16) and can serve as valuable, inclusive, international, professional and social networks for
scientists with common intellectual interests (13, 15).
Professional societies can facilitate the integration of URM scientists into their C of P through the creation and
implementation of programs to promote the diversity and inclusiveness of their membership and the STEM academic
workforce. Indeed, a recent public Request for Information by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS),
soliciting “strategies to enhance postdoctoral career transitions to promote faculty diversity, specifically in research-intensive
institutions,” revealed several unmet needs and proposed solutions that are well-suited to interventions by societies (17-18).
For example, respondents frequently cited bias and inadequate mentoring in academic environments as two major
impediments to URM scientist advancement into the professoriate, and proposed solutions such as enhanced mentoring and
networking opportunities, inclusive and welcoming environments, and skill development, including grant-writing and faculty
job search preparation (17-18). For decades, scientific societies have leveraged their unique strengths to develop and
administer a range of programs that promote diversity, inclusion and equity in the biosciences. Many of the publications
about these scientific society programs are descriptive in nature, mostly assessing short-term impact on trainees, while few
address the outcomes of long-term engagement of trainees with their professional organizations.
In this article, we aim to fill this gap by describing the synergistic ways in which the American Society for Cell
Biology (ASCB) and its Minorities Affairs Committee (MAC) have met the challenge of diversifying the biomedical
professoriate through programming that addresses some of the most common deficits encountered by URM individuals
wanting to join scientific C of P. We also discuss data collected by our organization indicating the benefits and challenges
that URM trainees experience during long-term scientific society engagement. We find evidence that increased representation
of URM scientists is obtainable through the work of scientific societies. We advocate for scientific societies not only to
engage in specific programming to increase the inclusion of URM scientists, but also to assess the outcomes and efficacy of
this programming to facilitate evidence-based modifications and improvements. The results of these assessments can shape
the future of our scientific societies and how their diversity-related missions are addressed. We also discuss below how the
ASCB, in part informed by the evidence presented, is currently working to shift its culture by bringing diversity into the
purview of a wider range of members and governing committees, beyond the MAC.
DISCUSSION
The ASCB, an international professional society of cell biologists founded in 1960, is “dedicated to advancing scientific
discovery, advocating sound research policies, improving education, promoting professional development, and increasing

diversity in the scientific workforce” (19-20, https://www.ascb.org/about-ascb/). Since 1980, the ASCB has relied upon its
MAC “to significantly increase the involvement of underrepresented minority scientists in all aspects of the Society,
promoting equity and a sense of belonging for URM cell biologists across their career trajectories” (19-20,
https://www.ascb.org/committee/minorities-affairs/). Thanks largely to MAC efforts, ASCB was awarded a 2004 Presidential
Award for Excellence in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Mentoring, the highest honor bestowed upon mentors who
work to expand STEM talent (http://paesmem.net/node/1765). Early on in its history, the MAC helped Society leadership
integrate diversity and inclusion goals into the ASCB mission, established working relationships with URM-focused
committees at other societies and successfully competed for funding from the National Institute for General Medical Sciences
(NIGMS) to support specific programming, beginning a tradition that has continued to the present day in the form of support
from the NSF and the National Institutes of Health (19-20). The MAC has provided educational and career development
opportunities for URM trainees for 30 years (19-20, L. Hammonds-Odie, M.J. Leibowitz, and M. Zavala, presented at the
2017 TWD Program Directors’ Meeting, Baltimore, MD, 18 to 21 June 2017), during which MAC members have used their
multidisciplinary scientific and pedagogical expertise to mentor and inspire the next generation of cell biologists from URM
backgrounds at a variety of academic stages, from undergraduate/graduate students and postdocs to junior faculty. ASCB
MAC initiatives have included programs aiming to increase the success of URM trainees in the science faculty workforce
(Table 1). We describe these programs briefly below to set the stage for a discussion of the long-term outcomes associated
with involvement in these MAC programs, as reported by trainees in our study.
Junior Faculty/Postdoctoral Fellows Career Development Workshop
The MAC’s Junior Faculty and Postdoctoral Fellow Career Development Workshop was held annually during the
summer months, for about 30 attendees per year, from 2006 through 2017 (20). The 2-3-day workshops aimed to help
trainees develop the skills needed for success as they transitioned into tenure-track positions. The workshops included
sessions on challenges and opportunities for URM populations, goal-setting and time management, getting published,
mentorship, professional conduct, laboratory management and career development at research and teaching institutions,
getting the job, NSF and NIH grant opportunities, securing tenure and career advancement, collaborations, networking, and
getting started as a new investigator. The workshop curriculum was revised over time to fit the needs of the trainees. Early
on, the workshop included opportunities for interested attendees to submit grants or manuscripts in advance for review and
feedback from workshop and ASCB faculty. More recently, the MAC deployed new methods to advance diversity and
inclusion goals, including adapting an applied theater approach to build skills in conflict resolution and managing difficult
professional interactions for female and URM postdocs and junior faculty (21). Ultimately, some of the elements of this

workshop were earmarked as ideas for seeding new programming. For example, the ASCB MAC later sought to secure
funding and establish a new program focused on participants submitting grants for feedback from experienced mentors—the
Faculty Research and Education Development (FRED) Program, described in detail below.
MAC Travel Awards to ASCB Annual Meeting
ASCB MAC Travel Awards enabled approximately 70 URM students and scientists per year, including students and
faculty from minority-serving institutions (MSIs), to attend the annual Society meeting in December. Trainees who applied
for awards were required to submit abstracts and present posters at the MAC/Education Committee-organized poster
competition. For faculty members, preference for travel awards was given to those who were early in their careers and who
planned to bring students to the annual ASCB meeting. To support these awardees, the ASCB MAC provided professional
development sessions at the annual meeting that awardees were encouraged to attend. These sessions were open to all ASCB
members, giving both URM and WR scientists an opportunity to receive mentoring, exchange perspectives, and network with
other scientists in similar career stages.
Visiting Professor (VP) Program
The VP program, which began in 1997, matched over 80 junior faculty members from UR backgrounds and/or MSIs
with host senior investigators at research-intensive institutions for one or two summers (8-10 weeks) of research in the senior
investigator’s laboratory, with the intent of strengthening the research and educational activities at the VPs’ home
institutions. An optional second year of funding was part of this program in later years and allowed the research relationship
to continue and for the results of the collaboration to be published. The MAC has determined that participation in the
program resulted in more publications and successful grant awards to the VPs, compared to a control group of peers (22).
Linkage Fellow (LF) Program
The LF program was established in 2000 to provide over 30 faculty members at MSIs with funding for outreach
activities supporting cell biology and science career development of students at their home institutions. The LF program has
supported workshops, undergraduate research experiences, and outreach to local middle and high schools (20). One of the
main objectives of this program was to promote the activities of the MAC and the ASCB at colleges and universities that
might not be aware of such activities and to recruit faculty and students to attend the annual meetings.
Participation in Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) training
The ASCB MAC provided funding to over 35 individuals from UR backgrounds and/or MSIs to attend scientific
courses at the MBL. In this way, the MAC enabled trainees to develop the technical skills needed for their academic success.
Mentoring Academy

The Mentoring Academy was developed in collaboration with ASCB’s Committee for Postdocs and Students
(COMPASS) and targeted postdoctoral fellows at major research institutions. The Mentoring Academy included mandatory
training on proactively managing mentoring relationships, which are critical for academic and professional success (23).
Faculty Research and Education Development (FRED) Program
This program began in 2014 and has bolstered grant development skills for 36 UR and/or MSI postdocs and junior
tenure-track faculty members. This was accomplished through the establishment of structured mentoring relationships
focused on grant development. FRED fellows were paired with more senior, well-funded and established scientists for a oneyear, grant writing/submission one-on-one mentoring relationship. The program started with a three-day workshop that
included grant writing sessions and presentations by both junior and senior faculty and postdoctoral fellows. So far, over half
of the participants have secured funding from the NIH, NSF, or other agencies.
MAC Program Short-term Outcomes: End-of-Program Surveys
The success of the programs outlined above was regularly assessed by anonymous surveys administered to
participants by an external evaluator. The majority of participants consistently reported positive objective outcomes and
specific benefits of MAC programs, including enhanced networking, successful grant applications, promotions and other
professional advancement, publications, research collaborations and curricular practices (21-22).
MAC Program Long-term Outcomes: Retrospective Survey Analysis
To better understand the long-term outcomes of trainee participation in ASCB MAC programs, we recently
surveyed postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty who participated between 2006 through 2015, with 98 (46%) of 215
individuals completing at least part of the survey (see Appendix 1 for study design and methods; approved by Institutional
Review Board at High Point University; protocol number 201811-755). Interestingly, most respondents participated in more
than one MAC program (54%) and most participated in a program more than three years ago (79%), highlighting the
potential of these interventions to fill the needs of trainees and have a positive impact on their career trajectories. The
percentages and numbers of respondents participating in each of the MAC program offerings are listed on Table 1 (see also
Appendix 2 for demographic and descriptive information of survey respondents). Participants have progressed in their
careers, with 88% continuing in academic careers involving some combination of teaching, research, and/or administration
(Table 2). 79% credited MAC programs with helping them attain academic promotions, 63% serve as PI or Co-PI on research
grants, and 52% have published scholarly articles or book chapters since their participation (Table 3). 53% credited MAC
program participation with receiving awards, honors, or other distinctions (Table 3).

Moreover, past trainees credited MAC programs for the attainment of psychosocial benefits, such as improved selfefficacy (Table 4). 90% of respondents reported that MAC programs helped them feel a part of a scientific C of P and looked
forward to continued interactions with networks developed through MAC programs (Table 5). This result highlights the
potential of scientific societies as an on-ramp catalyzing membership to scientific Cs of P.
Building on our past successes to amplify impact
The MAC, in part informed by the evidence presented above, is currently working to shift the culture of ASCB by integrating
diversity matters into a wider range of activities for members and governing committees, beyond the MAC. We hypothesize
that by including WR ASCB members and leadership in these programs, we will augment the power of our interventions for
UR, ultimately benefiting all members. Examples include new initiatives like an Prize for Excellence in Inclusivity Award
that is one of the featured annual meeting awards (sponsored by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,
https://www.ascb.org/award/new-ascb-prize-for-excellence-in-inclusivity/), a keynote talk and poster sessions at the ASCB
annual meeting, focused on the Scholarship of Diversity (https://www.ascb.org/meetings/scholarship-of-diversity/), diversity
training for ASCB leadership and Council members, as well as a revamped workshop for postdocs and junior faculty that is
not limited to a summer, but which continues for two years and maximizes the use of other annual meeting activities
(https://www.ascb.org/career-development/2020-accomplishing-career-transitions-act-program/). Most of these new efforts
are currently funded by a NIH-NIGMS IPERT grant (https://www.ascb.org/careers/ascb-receives-nigms-ipert-fundingdiversity-career-development-programs/). By bringing diversity and inclusion to the forefront of ASCB annual meeting
programming, we aim to amplify the impact of our efforts and accelerate progress on diversifying the professoriate.
CONCLUSION
To achieve a more inclusive and thus higher-performing STEM workforce and professoriate, we must recognize that
while URMs are well prepared to contribute to the scientific endeavor at the professoriate level (as evidenced by increasing
amounts of URMs that are NIH-supported Ph.D. recipients), they may lack the cultural capital needed to succeed in our
hyper-competitive academic landscape (3). Scientific societies can provide UR scientists with the training and mentoring
needed to meet the challenges of academic professions. In fact, while years of expansive programming have increased
representation in a variety of career stages of the STEM workforce, attainment of tenured faculty positions remains a tenuous
transition that should be the focus of particular attention (2, 24-26).
We have outlined examples of how such broad challenges can be addressed through programs within scientific
societies. Unlike individual institutions, scientific societies are nationwide networks offering discipline-rooted professional
support and leadership opportunities. Because the leaders of scientific societies are often standard-bearers in their fields, they

have the credibility and experience to serve as excellent role models to younger generations of professionals. Scientific
societies owe it to their membership to be as inclusive as possible and to help train future generations of scientists and
academicians. Fully diversifying the STEM workforce calls for scientific societies to continue and expand programming
designed to increase the URM proportion of undergraduate degree recipients and faculty in particular. The programs and data
reviewed here suggest that increases in URM scientist representation at these levels are obtainable through the work of
scientific societies.
We advocate for more scientific societies to engage in specific programming to increase the proportions of URM
scientists at the bachelor’s and faculty stages. Since many best practices, model programs, and Cs of P have already been
established, societies can continue this work and develop additional, targeted programs either alone or in collaboration with
one other. It is our hope that, in this way, scientific societies will further increase URM participation at key career transitions,
helping to achieve a truly inclusive and productive future STEM workforce.
Moving forward, creating and implementing successful, evidence-based interventions to broaden participation by
UR scientists in the biomedical enterprise will likely require not only systemic approaches across the career trajectory, but
also centralized collection, analysis and reporting of participant data to guide future programming (1, 4, 12). As transinstitutional organizations that foster the professional development of individual scientists across a wide range of career
stages, scientific societies are well-suited to help drive forward the diversification of the academic STEM workforce. ASCB
looks forward to working with and learning from other societies in our collective efforts to develop, evaluate and optimize
programs that broaden participation in the biomedical workforce.

Appendix 1: Study Design and Methods Summary
The MAC carried out a long-term outcomes survey to address the following research questions:
1. What impact has MAC program experience had on participants’ career progress, as gauged by publications, grants,
promotions, tenure, and similar indicators of career success?
2. To what extent has involvement in MAC programs resulted in intangible benefits and contributed to a sense of belonging
to a community of practice (C of P)?
3. Does involvement in more than one program, over a period of years, reinforce the impact on participants’ careers?
4. Does positive impact, if any, persist even after participant involvement comes to an end?
Between 2006 and 2015, approximately 300 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty members from
underrepresented groups participated in career development activities organized by the ASCB MAC. Current email addresses
for 215 of these participants were identified. These 215 individuals received a solicitation to respond to the survey that was
approved by the High Point University Institutional Review Board (protocol number 201811-755). The survey was
administered electronically using the ASCB MAC’s Survey Monkey account. 98 individuals completed at least part of the
survey (45.6% response rate) in January 2019.
Appendix 2: Demographic Information of Respondents
Of the 98 respondents, over half were female (Supplemental Table 1, 58%) and one-third (Supplemental Table 2, 32%) selfidentified as Hispanic or Latino. Over 30 of the survey respondents did not answer the question on race (Supplemental Table
3). Of the 68 who did answer, over half (Supplemental Table 3, 56%) self-identified as African American or Black. 6%
(Supplemental Table 3, 4) respondents self-identified as of mixed race (two identified as Black and Caucasian, one as
Hispanic and Caucasian, and one as Native American and Caucasian (Supplemental Table 3). No Native Hawaiian, Pacific
Islander, or South Asian individuals provided race information (Supplemental Table 3). The respondents also indicated that
29% (Supplemental Table 4, 28) were the first in their family to attend college; 26% (Supplemental Table 4, 25) were not
born in the United States; 23% (Supplemental Table 4, 23) had at least one parent born outside of the United States; and 21%
(Supplemental Table 4, 21) stated that the primary language spoken at home was not English.
