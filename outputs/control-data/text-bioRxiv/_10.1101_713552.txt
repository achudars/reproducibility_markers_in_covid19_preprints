Sleep and aging: Methodological challenges

Abstract
In quest of new avenues to explain, predict, and treat pathophysiological conditions during aging,
research on sleep and aging has flourished. Despite the great scientific potential to pinpoint
mechanistic pathways between sleep, aging, and pathology, only little attention has been paid to the
suitability of analytic procedures applied to study these interrelations. On the basis of
electrophysiological sleep and structural brain data of healthy younger and older adults, we
identify, illustrate, and resolve methodological core challenges in the study of sleep and aging. We
demonstrate potential biases in common analytic approaches when applied to older populations. We
argue that uncovering age-dependent alterations in the physiology of sleep requires the
development of adjusted and individualized analytic procedures that filter out age-independent
inter-individual differences. Age-adapted methodological approaches are thus required to foster the
development of valid and reliable biomarkers of age-associated cognitive pathologies.

Introduction
In search of novel biomarkers and treatment targets for age-related pathologies, sleep has recently
attracted much attention. Disrupted sleep represents one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s
disease (Lim et al., 2013; Lucey et al., 2019), but might also potentiate, accelerate, or even cause
cognitive pathology in old age (Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018; Vaou et al., 2018). Because of the assumed
bidirectional relationship between sleep and Alzheimer’s pathology (Ju et al., 2014; Mander et al.,
2016; Noble and Spires-Jones, 2019; Vaou et al., 2018; Winer et al., 2019), studying the interrelations
between sleep and neurocognitive aging has become increasingly popular.
Even in the absence of any diagnostically identifiable pathology, healthy aging entails
fundamental yet very characteristic changes in sleep (Mander, 2017; Ohayon et al., 2004; Vitiello,
2006). Overall, older adults’ sleep is shifted earlier in time (including earlier bed and wake times),
gets lighter, more fragile and shorter (Dijk et al., 2000; Monk et al., 2005). Sleep alterations are
evident in the global distribution and succession of sleep stages (i.e., the macro-structure of sleep;
Feinberg, 1974; Ohayon et al., 2004), but also involve a changed signature of electrical oscillations
that define and characterize different sleep states (i.e., the micro-structure of sleep; cf. Box 1; Carrier
et al., 2011; Crowley et al., 2002). In particular, older adults’ sleep is characterized by a drastic
reduction of deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, so-called slow-wave sleep (SWS), that is
accompanied by an increase of light NREM sleep (Carrier et al., 2011; Danker-Hopfe et al., 2005;
Ohayon et al., 2004; Redline et al., 2004). In contrast to NREM sleep, age-related changes in the
amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are typically more subtle (Redline et al., 2004; Scullin
and Gao, 2018), although a pronounced reduction of rapid eye movements within this sleep stage has
been reported (Darchia et al. 2003). Moreover, with advancing age, high-amplitude slow oscillations
(< 1 Hz), slow delta waves (1–4 Hz), and discrete sleep spindles (11–16 Hz) defining NREM sleep
appear less often and with reduced amplitudes and altered topography (Crowley et al., 2002; Dubé et
al., 2015; Fogel et al., 2012; Landolt and Borbély, 2001; Landolt et al., 1996; Martin et al., 2013).
Diminished homeostatic sleep pressure, circadian shifts, dysregulation of neurotransmitters, and
structural brain alterations may contribute to these pronounced changes in sleep during aging (for
more details see Dijk et al., 2000; Mander et al., 2017; Monk et al., 2005; Skeldon et al., 2016;
Zhong et al., 2019).
Standard criteria to describe these age-related alterations in sleep physiology are only rarely
tested and validated within heterogeneous samples that include older adults (but see, e.g., Ujma et al.,
2015, 2019; Warby et al., 2014). Therefore, in the following, we aim to demonstrate the possible
benefits and limitations of applying established indicators of sleep physiology in the context of aging

research. We aim to raise awareness for the complexity of aging that entails widespread structural
and functional brain changes that affect sleep in multiple ways (Dubé et al., 2015; Fogel et al., 2012,
2017; Muehlroth et al., 2019b). To identify meaningful biomarkers that can explain or even predict
cognitive decline in old age, we need to promote the use of sensitive and age-adjusted methodology
that captures within-person age-dependent changes in the physiology of sleep, rather than ageinflated inter-individual differences (Lindenberger et al., 2011).

Preamble: How do we define ‘old age’ and ‘aging’?
As an inevitable prerequisite, the identification of changes in sleep physiology during aging
requires an appropriate and transparent rationale on how research should delineate and investigate
‘old age’ and ‘aging.’ The literature in (cognitive) neuroscience is dominated by cross-sectional
group comparisons of ‘younger’ (~20–30 years) and ‘older’ adults (~60–80 years) (Browning and
Spilich, 1981; Hedden and Gabrieli, 2004). This is grounded in the notion that the brain’s structure
and function has already undergone profound alterations when humans reach their 60’s (e.g., Li et
al., 2004; Ohayon et al., 2004; Raz et al., 2005; Rönnlund et al., 2005; Ziegler et al., 2012). Beyond
stressing the importance of a general agreement on the definition of ‘old age’ to ensure the
comparability of research on aging, we want to highlight two challenges that accompany such a
definition: First, the chronological age of individuals can deviate from their biological age. Second,
age differences derived from such group comparisons cannot capture aging in terms of age-related
change.
First and foremost, one should bear in mind that chronological age, i.e., the time that has
passed since birth, is a variable that does not induce or explain any developmental change in itself
(Wohlwill, 1970). At best, it can serve as a proxy for an individual’s expected functional capacity
that relies on true mechanistic alterations taking place as humans age (Li and Schmiedek, 2002;
MacDonald et al., 2011). The conceptual and methodological pitfalls of using chronological age as
an index of development or aging have been discussed elsewhere in detail (e.g., Cole et al., 2017a,
2019; Lindenberger and Pötter, 1998; MacDonald et al., 2011; Wohlwill, 1970). Due to great interindividual variation in the manifestation of aging effects (Cabeza et al., 2018; Habib and Nyberg,
2007; Lindenberger, 2014), particularly in old age, chronological age can deviate greatly from an
individual’s biological age (Cole et al., 2017a, 2019; MacDonald et al., 2011; Steffener et al., 2016).
Importantly, physiological brain age, as for instance derived from estimates of structural brain
integrity, could represent a better and more informative predictor of differences in aging, individual
(brain) health, functional capacity, and mortality (Burzynska et al., 2013; Cole et al., 2018, 2017a,

2017b; Franke et al., 2010). Notably, also brain age derived from the sleep electroencephalogram
(EEG) has lately shown its potential to serve as a sensitive index of aging and pathology (Sun et
al., 2019). In the course of this paper, we will suggest that the sensitivity of sleep physiology as a
potential biomarker of brain age, aging, and age-related disease is closely tied to a fair and adapted
investigation and evaluation of sleep in aged individuals.
Strictly speaking, the term aging describes a process of change, taking place as organisms
grow older. Cross-sectional age comparisons are not appropriate to inform us about these changes
(Hertzog and Nesselroade, 2003; Hofer and Sliwinski, 2001; Li and Schmiedek, 2002; Lindenberger
and Pötter, 1998; Lindenberger et al., 2011; Overton, 2010; Raz and Lindenberger, 2011). When
sampling age-heterogeneous groups cross-sectionally, essential confounds such as cohort effects or
sampling bias may covary with age and thus prevent or bias conclusions on intra-individual
dynamics of change (Hertzog and Nesselroade, 2003; Hofer and Sliwinski, 2001; Li and
Schmiedek, 2002; Lindenberger et al., 2011; Rönnlund et al., 2005; Wohlwill, 1970). For
convenience, however, we will use the phrase aging independently of the respective study’s
sampling design in this article. The lack of longitudinal studies on sleep in adulthood does not
allow for the identification of ‘real’ age-related changes of sleep physiology. Hence, we emphasize
that longitudinal study designs are essential to study aging and to identify the lead-lag relations
between age-related alterations in brain structure and function (Hofer and Sliwinski, 2001; Li and
Schmiedek, 2002; Lindenberger, 2014; Raz and Lindenberger, 2011).

Box 1. Sleep electrophysiology at a glance
In most animal species, three different and discrete states of vigilance can be differentiated:
wakefulness, REM (rapid eye movement), and NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (Vassalli
and Dijk, 2009). REM and NREM sleep can be clearly distinguished based on electrophysiological
characteristics (Aserinsky and Kleitman, 1953; Dement and Wolpert, 1958; Feinberg and Evarts,
1969; Loomis et al., 1935, 1962). REM sleep is marked by the occurrence of phasic irregular and
rapid eye movements, muscle atony, and desynchronized wake-like electroencephalographic
activity. NREM sleep, by contrast, is characterized by synchronous, low-frequency, high-amplitude
EEG oscillations (Iber et al., 2007). NREM sleep can further be divided into the three sub-stages
N1, N2 and N3 (also SWS; Iber et al., 2007; Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968). These NREM substages form a continuum of increasing arousal threshold and sleep depth (Carskadon and Dement,
2011). At the same time, they serve as a proxy for the dominance of different sleep-specific
oscillatory brain signals: Lighter NREM sleep (stage 2 or N2 sleep) is defined by the occurrence of
discrete sleep spindles (i.e., rhythmically waxing and waning oscillatory events with a typical

frequency of 11–16 Hz), and K-complexes (i.e., phasic negative high-amplitude EEG deflections
that are followed by a positive EEG component). With deeper sleep, the number and power of EEG
slow waves increases. This predominance of slow EEG waves defines the presence of SWS (stage 3
or N3 sleep).

Challenge 1: Ambiguous sleep stage definitions across age
groups
Standardized visual scoring of sleep stages is regarded as the ‘gold-standard’ of sleep research.
Defined sleep stages are thereby considered sensitive indicators of specific physiological events.
However, current sleep stage definitions may not capture the same physiological processes across
age groups. We suggest that genuine sleep analysis – in line with similar views from animal
research – should consider the continuous nature of NREM sleep. A focus on the presence of
predefined electrophysiological events, like the occurrence or coupling of slow oscillations and
sleep spindles, during both stage 2 sleep and SWS is required.

Pitfalls of visually scoring SWS
In human research, the classification of sleep stages (cf. Box 1) is based on widely accepted
standardized rules that are used to score sleep by means of EEG activity, muscle tone, and eye
movements (Iber et al., 2007; Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968). SWS, as defined by the American
Academy for Sleep Medicine (AASM; Iber et al., 2007), requires the presence of 0.5–2 Hz waves with
a minimum amplitude of 75 V covering more than 20 % of a sleep time segment. Already in 1982,
Webb noted that the frequently reported striking age-related reduction in SWS likely results from the
use of a fixed amplitude threshold to define slow waves (Webb, 1982; Webb and Dreblow, 1982; cf.
Figure 1A, Table 1). As also acknowledged by the AASM (Silber et al., 2007), reliably measuring
SWS using an amplitude criterion below 75 V is possible. Still, the current version of the manual
for sleep scoring that defines the prevailing gold-standard, relies on a minimum amplitude criterion
of 75 µV. Crucially, the age-related reduction in slow wave (< 4 Hz) and slow oscillation (< 1 Hz)
amplitudes is one of the most consistent findings in age-comparative sleep studies (Carrier et al.,
2011; Dubé et al., 2015; Mander et al., 2017; Muehlroth et al., 2019b; Ujma et al., 2019). Typically,
SWS is easily identifiable in younger adults because slow waves exceed the required amplitude
threshold. By contrast, the identification of true SWS in older adults is challenging: Due to the
reduction of slow wave amplitudes below 75 V (cf. Figure 1B and C, Table 2), time segments can
often not be scored as SWS but are rather assigned to stage 2 sleep – although all other

characteristics of the sleep epoch suggest the presence of SWS (i.e., the predominance of lowfrequency EEG waves but absence of eye movements along with reduced muscle tone; cf. Figure 2).
Re-analyzing our own previously published data from 29 healthy younger (range: 19–28
years, Mage = 23.55 years, SDage = 2.58; 16 females) and 34 healthy older adults (range: 63–74
years, Mage = 68.85 years, SDage = 3.11, 15 females), we demonstrate the effects of fixed amplitude
thresholds for visual sleep scoring in age-comparative studies. Participants’ nighttime sleep was
monitored using ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) before and after completing an associative
learning task (cf. Supplementary Methods; Muehlroth et al., 2019a,b). Subjective sleep quality was
assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989) and comparable in
both age groups (Z = 1.03, p = .305, MdYA= 4.5 [3.0; 6.25], MdOA= 4.0 [3.0; 5.0]). We show that,
overall, in our dataset the extent of age-related reductions in visually scored SWS matched the
increase in stage 2 sleep in older adults (Cohen’s dstage 2 = –2.3 [–2.96; –1.63]; Cohen’s d

SWS

=

2.18 [1.53; 2.83]; Table 1). Visually scoring the data from older adults, a reduction – and in some
participants even ‘absence’ – of SWS became evident in comparison to younger adults (Table 1,
Figure 1A). Closely inspecting the sleep architecture of older adults in our sample, it became
evident that the older age group was divided into subjects not exhibiting any or only few SWS, and
subjects showing a more ‘youth-like’ proportion of SWS (Figure 1A). In part, this bisection of older
subjects might be due to inter-individual differences in the amplitude of slow oscillations, with half
of the older adults showing slow oscillation amplitudes below the proposed 75 V threshold on
average (MdOA = 71.83 V; Figure 1B). For older adults, falling above or below this threshold
divided the sample into individuals with and without SWS according to the standard scoring
system (Figure 1C). None of the younger adults undercut an average slow oscillation amplitude
threshold of 75 V (MdYA = 123.17 V) and, accordingly, SWS could be effectively scored in this
age group (Figure 1B and C).
Taken together, it appears that due to age-related reductions in slow wave amplitudes, the fixed
amplitude criterion of 75 V for scoring SWS results in a biased estimate of SWS presence in older
populations. Descriptively providing standardized estimates of sleep architecture is important to
ensure the comparability and validity of studies. In studies with heterogeneous samples, though,
researchers should acknowledge that such derived sleep stage estimates may be severely biased. As
Rechtschaffen and Kales themselves put it in 1968 when establishing the standardized scheme for
visual sleep scoring: “Even among human subjects, however, there are some individuals or groups
whose polygraph recordings may require further description or elaboration than that provided by
the stages proposed here” (Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968).

The need to acknowledge the continuous nature of NREM sleep
The potential bias of current sleep stage definitions across age groups has direct theoretical and
methodological implications. These affect the way we should conceive and treat NREM sleep and
its sub-stages in our theories and analyses. The transition between stage 1, stage 2, and SWS
happens continuously with slow waves increasing in amplitude and abundance as NREM sleep gets
deeper. On the contrary, sleep spindles show a reversed pattern with predominance during lighter
stage 2 NREM sleep (Prerau et al., 2017). Hence, stage 2 and SWS are often treated as proxies for the
dominance of different sleep-specific oscillatory brain signals (Genzel et al., 2014; Hobson, 1968).
Although generally accepted in human sleep research, the distinction between sleep stage 2 and
SWS based on a certain amplitude and time criterion (Iber et al., 2007) is not without problems
(Genzel et al., 2014; Lacroix et al., 2018; Webb, 1982; Silber et al., 2007). Challenges include the
handling of potentially biased sleep stage estimates in different age groups and the comparability of
estimates between human and animal research (e.g., Genzel et al., 2014; Lacroix et al., 2018).
As discussed above, the current criteria to define the presence of SWS along with great interindividual variation in slow wave amplitudes may severely bias the assignment of a specific sleep
segment to stage 2 sleep or SWS. Between the ages of 5 and 90, the proportion of NREM sleep
decreases only little (Ohayon et al., 2004). The composition of visually scored NREM sleep itself,
however, changes drastically across the lifespan. This might at least partly stem from the fact that
time segments ‘equivalent’ to SWS may be scored as stage 2 sleep because the amplitude criterion
of 75 V is not met and result in two major problems: First, the assignment of SWS-like time
segments to stage 2 sleep in older adults blurs the boundary between the two stages. As a
consequence, sleep stages can no longer be regarded as a direct reflection or proxy of underlying
neural and physiological processes (Hobson, 1968). Second, due to skewed distributions and
reduced variance, any correlational analysis relying on measures of SWS is biased, or even
prevented, in samples of older adults – especially in samples of older adults with a large percentage
of ‘no-SWS’ participants. As a result, a clear-cut association between a given physiological state –
identified via a corresponding sleep stage – and an outcome measure, like the ability to maintain
memories across sleep (e.g., Diekelmann and Born, 2010; Rasch and Born, 2013), is hardly tangible
in age-comparative studies. If the definitions used to identify a given sleep stage do not capture the
same phenomenon (e.g., the presence of slow oscillations) to the same degree across age groups, age
differences in associations with outcome measures can hardly capture the intended mechanism. For
example, the observation that memory performance is more consistently associated with SWS in
younger than in older adults, could be taken as evidence that slow oscillations forfeit their

functionality for memory processing during aging (e.g., Baran et al., 2016; Scullin, 2013; Sonni and
Spencer, 2015). However, if slow oscillations are present in older adults but just attributed to a
different sleep stage, the statistics might be correct, but the functional interpretation would be
different. In this case, slow oscillations found in a different sleep stage may continue to contribute
to the consolidation of memories even in old age – a matter of fact only revealed when focusing on
the oscillatory phenomena themselves (e.g., Helfrich et al., 2018; Mander et al., 2013; Muehlroth et
al., 2019b; Varga et al., 2016; Westerberg et al., 2012).
Given the described challenges a NREM sleep subdivision bears, it may be hardly surprising
that research in other species refrains from applying such a sub-classification (but see Lacroix et al.,
2018, for a recent attempt for ‘human-like’ sub-classification of NREM sleep in rodents). The term
‘SWS’ is typically used to describe the whole continuum of NREM sleep, which has evoked pivotal
misunderstandings when comparing human and animal research (Genzel et al., 2014). This
conception of NREM sleep may arise from the prevailing sleep scoring procedure in rodents that can
easily distinguish between REM and NREM sleep on the basis of movements and spectral parameters
of electrical neuronal activity during sleep, but less so between NREM sub-stages (Bagur et al.,
2018; Lacroix et al., 2018). In humans, contemplating whole-night multitaper spectral EEG data
irrespective of participants’ age, the distinct natures of REM and NREM sleep becomes evident,
whereas differences between SWS and stage 2 sleep are more subtle as they transition gradually
(Figure 2; see Prerau et al., 2017 for a detailed description of the spectral dynamics of the wholenight multitaper spectogram). Crucially, this does not signify that NREM sleep should be regarded
as a uniform state, rather that the continuous nature of NREM sub-stages must be acknowledged,
which makes a clear-cut distinction and definition of stage 2 and SWS problematic, if not
impossible.
To conclude, an explicit distinction between stage 2 and SWS bears not only methodological but
also theoretical difficulties. A coherent methodology to study the complex and dynamic nature of
sleep not only within, but also between species is required to enable informative study comparisons
(cf. Prerau et al., 2007). Research on the causes and consequences of inter-individual and agerelated differences in sleep physiology should thus transcend stage-based analyses and rather
consider the actual exploranda, ie., the underlying neurophysiological processes (for instance, the
occurrence of rhythmic thalamocortical sleep spindles) present during both stage 2 sleep and SWS.

corresponding whole-night multitaper spectral EEG data at electrode Cz (lower panels). Both
younger and older adults show a similarly increased low-frequency power during periods of NREM
sleep (some examples highlighted by blue ellipses) along with a distinct increase in power in the fast
spindle frequency range (approx. 12.5–16 Hz) that disappears during REM sleep (violet ellipses).
Periods of wake are characterized by an additional strong enhancement of alpha (8–12 Hz) and high
frequency power (red ellipses). Although the older adult only has a small amount of visually scored
SWS, the spectrogram clearly shows periods of enhanced low frequency and spindle power – in
line with the canonical SWS characteristics found in younger adults. No clear distinction between
stage 2 and SWS is observed on the basis of spectral EEG characteristics. Note the differences in
absolute sleep duration (x-axis). YA: younger adult; REM: rapid eye movement sleep; SWS: slowwave sleep; OA: older adult.

Box 2. Guidance for the interpretation of frequently reported oscillatory characteristics
Spectral power. The spectral power in predefined frequency bands is believed to mirror the
presence of rhythmic neural activity, i.e., periodic alternations in the excitability of neuronal
populations (Buzsáki, 2006; Buzsáki et al., 2016; Cohen, 2014). Yet, conventional estimates of
spectral power reflect a compound of rhythmic and arrhythmic activity and, within their rhythmic
component, index a combination of the duration and the amplitude of oscillations within a specific
frequency range (Cohen, 2014; Kosciessa et al., in press).
Amplitude. The amplitude of an oscillation reflects the degree of synchronized neuronal firing:
Small amplitudes relate to more local synchronous firing, whereas large amplitudes reflect more
global synchronous changes in membrane potentials (Buzsáki, 2006; Nir et al., 2011). The basis for
this cortical synchronization is the integrity of cortical areas involved in the generation and
propagation of a certain oscillation (Dubé et al., 2015; Saletin et al., 2013). In aging, cortical
thinning and atrophy may diminish the scalp-detectable range of amplitudes. Age differences in
oscillatory amplitudes may, on the one hand, reflect a minimized extent of synchronous neuronal
firing as direct consequence of structural brain changes in the course of aging (Dubé et al., 2015). On
the other hand, anatomical alterations of the brain and skull may influence the conduction of the
EEG signal and thus attenuate the amplitude of an oscillation measured on the scalp (Leissner et al.,
1970; Segalowitz and Davies, 2004). Besides, reduced slow wave amplitudes in old age may arise
from alterations in homeostatic sleep pressure, which is typically reduced as humans age (Dijk et
al., 2000; Esser et al., 2007; Vyazovskiy et al., 2009).
Frequency. In general, the inherent frequency of an oscillation may index the efficiency and
speed of neural information transfer (Dubois et al., 2008; Grandy et al., 2013; Klimesch, 1999;
Posthuma et al., 2001). The typical developmental acceleration of various oscillatory components
including sleep spindles (Campbell and Feinberg, 2016; Purcell et al., 2017) is believed to depend
on the differentiation of thalamocortical feedback loops due to maturation, optimization of synaptic
connections, and neuronal myelination (Campbell and Feinberg, 2016; Clawson et al., 2016; Dubois
et al., 2008; Klimesch, 1999; Piantoni et al., 2013). Maintained or even increased frequency of fast
spindles in old age (Crowley et al., 2002; Fogel et al., 2017; Nicolas et al., 2001; but see Martin et al.,
2013) may indicate a largely preserved functionality of thalamocortical cells during aging. In
contrast, the consistently reported slowing and flattening of slow oscillations in old age (Carrier et
al., 2011; Dubé et al., 2015; Mander et al., 2017) may be the consequence of reduced synaptic load
and homeostatic sleep pressure in old age and indicative of decelerated and less synchronous
switches between phases of neuronal excitability and inhibition (Bersagliere and Achermann, 2010;
Carrier et al., 2011; Dijk et al., 2000; Dubé et al., 2015; Fogel et al., 2012; Vyazovskiy et al., 2009

Challenge 2: Multiple ways to describe sleep physiology
The multitude of indicators and available algorithms used to describe sleep-specific neural activity
hampers the comparability of results between studies. We argue that the validity and value of agecomparative sleep research depends greatly on the precise definition of indicators that reflect a
neural process of interest as directly as possible. In our view, indicators of sleep micro-structure
should always be preferred as they more closely mirror the dynamics and characteristics of sleepspecific neural activity.
Everyone engaging in sleep research will soon realize the multitude and inconsistency of indicators
available to describe neurophysiological activity during sleep (Supplementary Figure 1). Comparing
different measurement occasions (Brandmaier et al., 2018) and diverse indicators of slow oscillatory
activity during NREM sleep in our own data set (namely % SWS, relative SWA, and the number,
density, frequency, and amplitude of detected slow oscillations), we noticed a generally poor
agreement between the different variables both across and within age groups (ICC = 0.201 [–.15;
.47], F(62,310) = 1.25, p = .113; ICCYA = 0.13 [–.48; .54], FYA(28,140) = 1.15, pYA = .295; ICCOA =
0.09 [–.49; .49], FOA(33,165) = 1.1, pOA = .342; cf. Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, the testretest reliability of the same variable between two consecutively recorded nights was good to
excellent (all ICC ≥ .78, all F ≥ 4.61, all p < .001; cf. Supplementary Table 1). A moderate testretest reliability of relative SWA in the group of older adults was the only exception (ICC = .68 [.33;
.85], F(33,33) = 3.69, p < .001). Critically, all participants engaged in an extensive associative
learning task between the two recorded nights (cf. Muehlroth et al., 2019a,b). As demanding
learning is known to influence indicators of spindle and slow oscillatory activity (e.g., Gais et al.,
2002; Mölle et al., 2011, 2009), the reported estimates should even be considered as the lower
bounder of reliability. Taken together, even though sleep physiology can be very reliably measured
by applying common analytic approaches, the great disparity of available indicators calls for a
thorough consideration of the way we describe sleep physiology in our analyses.
In general, the validity of indicators to quantify neural activity during sleep scales with their
resolution and precision: Age differences in sleep are best captured by describing the dynamics and
features of neural activity in as much detail and as directly as possible. Using machine learning on
3500 sleep recordings covering the ages 18 to 80, Sun and colleagues (2019) recently demonstrated
that oscillatory dynamics during sleep – like fluctuations in spectral power – (i.e., the microstructure of sleep) can reliably predict participants’ age (mean absolute deviation 7.8 years; see

Sun et al., 2019). Global sleep stage composition (i.e., the macro-structure of sleep), in contrast,
turned out to be a less appropriate predictor of chronological age (mean absolute deviation 23.3
years; Sun et al., 2019). Sleep is known to be a dynamic process (Prerau et al., 2017; Spiess et
al., 2018; Yetton et al., 2018). The use of sleep stage estimates mismatches our current theoretical
understanding of sleep and strongly reduces resolution of the data (Conte and Ficca 2013; Prerau et
al., 2017). Altogether, we believe that the analysis of sleep EEG data should transcend beyond the
report of sleep stages and global spectral features and focus on the micro-structure of sleep.
To avoid using the proportion of SWS as a proxy for the presence of slow waves, analyses
increasingly report on slow-wave activity (SWA). SWA measures the spectral delta power (i.e., 0.5–
4.5 Hz) via a transformation of the data in the frequency domain (e.g., a Fast Fourier Transformation,
FFT). In conjunction with a normalization procedure – e.g., dividing the respective frequency band
by the total power of the whole spectrum – the influence of possible confounds such as frequencyunspecific inter-individual differences in EEG amplitudes can be minimized (see, e.g., Dannhauer et
al., 2011; Frodl et al., 2001; Leissner et al., 1970; Segalowitz and Davies, 2004; Werkle-Bergner et
al., 2009, for arguments on how inter-individual differences in anatomical properties of the brain
and skull influence the EEG signal). A normalized measure of SWA increases the comparability
across diverse study populations. However, spectral power, as conventionally measured with FFT, is
a compound of rhythmic processes and the arrhythmic 1/f background spectrum that, crucially, is
flattened in older compared to younger adults (Voytek et al., 2015; Supplementary Figure 2; see
Haller et al., 2018; Kosciessa et al., in press; Wen and Liu, 2016; Whitten et al., 2011 for
approaches to separate rhythmic activity from the arrhythmic background spectrum). Moreover, as
spectral power conflates both duration and amplitude of rhythmic neural activity (e.g., Kosciessa et
al., in press), an interpretation of SWA in terms of abundance or strength of slow waves remains
difficult (Amzica and Steriade, 1998; Mensen et al., 2016). “Thus it is essential to strive toward a
characterization of sleep EEG oscillations that faithfully represent the underlying data, allowing us
to apply the wealth of knowledge we have gained about the continuum of the underlying
neurophysiological mechanisms to the interpretation of the EEG” (Prerau et al., 2017, p. 63).
Technological developments over the past decades are increasingly facilitating analysis of
specific features and characteristics of neural events during sleep (Mensen et al., 2016; Mölle et al.,
2002; Prerau et al., 2017). Such analyses can incorporate the amplitude, oscillatory frequency, the
density of occurrence (i.e., number of events per time interval), and the slope of specific oscillatory
events. These different indicators are often used interchangeably although they signify differential
physiological properties and, accordingly, show differential age dependency (cf. Box 2,

Supplementary Figure 1). If applied correctly, though, they hold great explanatory power and can
provide more informed insights into the aging brain (Fogel et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2019; Ujma et al.,
2019). Moreover, the possibility to identify individual oscillatory events also entails the opportunity
to investigate how different oscillations and neural processes interact (Helfrich et al., 2018; Klinzing
et al., 2016; Muehlroth et al., 2019b; Staresina et al., 2015). At the moment, due to the variety of
algorithms available to study oscillatory brain signals and their interaction during sleep, these
analyses are still time-consuming and between-study comparability of indicators can be challenging
(Figure 3; cf. Warby et al., 2014). To tackle these problems, currently, several open source projects
are under development that aim to harmonize and standardize analysis pipelines and parameters and
make them publically available (e.g., Luna [http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/luna/], Sleep [Combrisson et
al.,

2017;

http://visbrain.org/sleep.html],

[http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3382284]; all code and sample data to reproduce this manuscript’s
EEG analysis pipeline will be available on the Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/zur2b/]).
Identifying and resolving these discrepancies – ideally by the use of common algorithms – will lay
the grounds for a mechanistic understanding of the causes and consequences of age-related changes
in sleep (Helfrich et al., 2018; Muehlroth et al., 2019b).

Challenge 3: Amplitude reductions – towards algorithms
with adjusted thresholds
The benefits of a direct investigation of slow oscillatory events are constrained by a lacking
consensus on the detection thresholds to be applied. We suggest that a fair assessment of true slow
oscillatory activity requires the use of amplitude thresholds that are adjusted individually within
participants.
Studying rhythmic neural activity during sleep requires a reliable detection of oscillatory events
themselves. Here, automated slow oscillation detection methods offer an efficient way to identify
the presence and characteristics of individual slow oscillations (eg., Massimini et al., 2004; Mensen
et al., 2016; Mölle et al., 2002; Nir et al., 2011). Typically, oscillation detection algorithms rely on a
bandpass-filtered EEG signal within a theoretically implied frequency range (eg., 0.5–1 Hz for slow
oscillations, see Challenge 4 for details on the definition of frequency ranges). The presence of
oscillatory components is then inferred by applying certain amplitude and peak detection criteria (cf.
Supplementary Methods). Amplitude criteria can either be based on fixed thresholds or on variable
thresholds adjusted within individuals (e.g., Massimini et al., 2004; Mölle et al., 2009, 2002;
15

Staresina et al., 2015). In analogy to the visual scoring of SWS, many algorithms rely on a criterion
of 75 V (Carrier et al., 2011; Dubé et al., 2015; Piantoni et al., 2013) or even higher amplitudes
(Heib et al., 2013; Massimini et al., 2004) for the detection of slow oscillations during NREM sleep.
But an increasing number of studies opt for thresholds adjusted individually for each participant
(e.g., Klinzing et al., 2016; Mölle et al., 2011; Ngo et al., 2015). As yet, there is neither a goldstandard nor consensus on the most suitable method nor on the threshold settings to be applied when
identifying the presence of oscillatory events (Mensen et al., 2016; Ujma et al., 2019). However, the
choice of detection thresholds has profound effects on the analysis of age differences.
Irrespective of the applied detection threshold (i.e., a fixed threshold of 75 V vs. an
individually adjusted threshold of 1.25 times the mean amplitude of all putative slow oscillations; cf.
Supplementary Methods), in the older adults in our data, the number, density (i.e., the number of
slow oscillations per minute of NREM sleep), amplitude, and frequency of slow oscillations were
all reduced (Table 2). Nevertheless, compared to an individually adjusted amplitude criterion, the
extent of age effects was augmented when using a fixed detection threshold of 75 V (nonoverlapping confidence intervals for Cohen’s d of slow oscillation density, cf. Table 2). Using
individually adjusted thresholds, as displayed in Figure 1B, in older adults, the average slow
oscillation amplitude fell below the 75 V criterion in 61.77 % of the subjects (21 out of 34
compared to only one younger subject [3.45 %]). In other words, in older adults, a large number of
potential slow oscillations will not be detected in case of a fixed amplitude criterion of 75 V as the
detection is biased towards higher-amplitude oscillations (Figure 3B). As a consequence, slow
oscillation density estimates that are derived using individually adjusted vs. fixed detection
thresholds are comparable in younger but not in older adults (ZYA= –.88, pYA = .38; ZOA = 6.08, pOA <
.001; see Table 2; Figure 3A).
Critically, inter-individual differences in slow oscillation amplitudes might not only carry
functional information but may be confounded by differences in homeostatic sleep regulation (Dijk
et al., 2000), brain integrity (Dubé et al., 2015; Saletin et al., 2013), and skull thickness (Leissner et
al., 1970; Frodl et al., 2001). Hence, an individually adjusted amplitude threshold that tags slow
oscillations with the largest amplitudes within individuals may have advantages. Only when slow
oscillations are selected independently of inter-individual differences in EEG amplitudes, do
unbiased comparisons become possible. Persisting age differences in the amplitude, density, and
morphology of slow oscillations can then be interpreted as valid age group differences. Compared to
fixed amplitude detection criteria, especially in age-comparative settings, the use of individually

adjusted amplitude criteria for detecting slow oscillations during NREM sleep provides a more
realistic and at the same time less biased measure of true slow oscillatory activity.

Challenge 4: Differential frequency shifts in sleep oscillations
– towards individualized frequency ranges
The exact frequency band in which an oscillatory event can be observed varies between individuals
and is influenced by age. To prevent missing true oscillatory events during detection and mixing up
functionally distinct oscillatory components, cut-off frequencies have to be determined carefully. We
argue that individually determined frequency ranges are the prerequisite to derive meaningful ageand person-specific characteristics of oscillatory components.

Contemplating frequency cut-offs for low-frequency oscillatory components
Age-related changes in the appearance of sleep oscillations do not only include alterations in
amplitudes, but also entail shifts in the intrinsically expressed frequencies of the respective neural
events. With respect to low-frequency components, a global slowing has consistently been reported
(Carrier et al., 2011; Dubé et al., 2015; Mander et al., 2017) (Figure 4I, Box 2). These effects
comprise both slow oscillations (< 1 Hz) as well as slow waves with higher frequencies (1–4 Hz).
Although slow oscillations and slow waves constitute different entities on a theoretical level
(Achermann and Borbély, 1997; Amzica and Steriade, 1998; Steriade et al., 1993), the applied cutoff frequencies defining low-frequency EEG components are often not much attended to.
Empirically, the problem of identifying the exact frequency ranges for specific oscillatory
components in individual participants can be solved by considering the NREM sleep power
spectrum. Peaks in the power spectrum signify the presence of rhythmic neural activity at a given
frequency (Aru et al., 2015; Kosciessa et al., in press; Whitten et al., 2011). When visually
inspecting the age-specific power spectra during NREM sleep in our data, it became evident that the
peak in low-frequency power was shifted to even lower frequencies in older adults (Supplementary
Figure 2). This slowing in low frequencies was statistically reliable (average frequency peak: t(115)
= 6.18, p < .001, MYA = 0.73 Hz, MOA = 0.53 Hz) and was also evident for discrete slow oscillation
events (Z = 3.24, p = .001, MdYA= 0.79 Hz, MdOA = 0.77 Hz; see Table 2, Figure 3B, Figure 4C).
Although statistically detectable, in contrast to the dramatic reduction in slow oscillation
amplitudes, inter-individual and age differences in slow oscillation frequencies were relatively small
(dfrequency = 0.90 [0.36; 1.44]; damplitude = 2.28 [1.62; 2.94], non-overlapping confidence interval; cf.
Table 2).
Taken together, it appears that the magnitude of the slowing of slow oscillations in old age does
not reach an extent that would bias detection results when established frequency ranges (e.g., 0.5–1
Hz for slow oscillations) are utilized. Nonetheless, we emphasize the need to carefully consider,
19

justify, and report the selected frequency range when publishing sleep research findings on older
adults. Slow oscillations and ‘faster’ slow waves have been associated with differential homeostatic
regulation (Bersagliere and Achermann, 2010; Werth et al., 1997) as well as with divergent roles in
the context of cognitive pathology in aging (Lucey et al., 2019; Mander et al., 2015, 2016). Yet,
detection algorithms often deploy frequency bands that comprise both oscillatory components (e.g.,
Carrier et al., 2011; Kurth et al., 2010). Finally, one should bear in mind that even when using adequate
frequency cut-offs, filtering can induce signal distortions. The choice of filter type and filter parameters
will differentially influence the signal and change detection results (Widmann et al., 2015). Together, we
thus underscore the need for clear and coherent terminology along with appropriate parameter
settings and detection criteria when reporting on age differences in low-frequency oscillatory activity.

Note. All slow oscillation and spindle characteristics were derived using individually adjusted

Inter-individual (age) variation in fast and slow spindle frequency bands
In contrast to slow oscillations whose detection seems mostly dependent on appropriate amplitude
settings, the detection of sleep spindles is heavily influenced by the selection of frequency ranges. In
particular, the detection of spindle events is challenged by the presence of two spindle types. Slow
(ca. 9–12.5 Hz) and fast spindles (ca. 12.5–16 Hz) differ in frequency, topography (Figure 4) (De
Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003; Doran, 2003; Klinzing et al., 2016; Schabus et al., 2007), generating
mechanisms (Ayoub et al., 2013; Schabus et al., 2007; Timofeev and Chauvette, 2013), and not least
in their functionality (Barakat et al., 2011; Fogel and Smith, 2011; Mölle et al., 2011). Although the
existence of two spindle types is now widely acknowledged, there is no general consensus on the
exact definition of the frequency range in which to expect slow and fast spindles should be expected
(Cox et al., 2017). Critically, spindles undergo a complex developmental shift and differentiation in

their inherent frequency, power and topography (Campbell and Feinberg, 2016; Crowley et al.,
2002; Nicolas et al., 2001; Purcell et al., 2017). This not only challenges research on younger adults
(Cox et al., 2017), but also research that focuses on the entire lifespan.
In line with these observations, slow and fast spindle frequencies were differentially affected by
age in our data. Average fast spindle frequency was increased in older adults (F(1,56) = 14.12, p <
.001, MYA= 13.39 Hz, MOA = 13.68 Hz) (Figure 4A, Box 2). In contrast, an age-related decrease in the
average frequency of slow spindles was only pronounced at electrode Cz

interaction: F(3,168) = 9.78, p < .001, ZCz = 3.31, p < .001, MdYA = 11.28 Hz, MdOA = 10.61 Hz; all
other |Z| ≤ 1.41, all other p ≥ .158, -level adjusted to .0125; Figure 4B). The complexity of
frequency shifts during aging is thus even enhanced by the topographical intricacy of the observed
effects.
The multiple facets of age differences in sleep spindle appearance require the careful
consideration of an age-adjusted definition of spindle frequency ranges. Based on individually
identified peaks in the NREM sleep power spectrum at topographical locations where slow and fast
spindles are expected (cf. Supplementary Figure 2), individually adjusted spindle frequency ranges
can be defined – even if they might not match conventionally prescribed bands exactly (Adamczyk
et al., 2015; Bódizs et al., 2009; Cox et al., 2017; Doppelmayr et al., 1998; Grandy et al., 2013;
Klimesch, 1999; Ujma et al., 2015). Comparisons between spindle detection algorithms that use
commonly predefined frequency ranges and those that adjust their frequency range definitions within
individuals, provide a strikingly poor agreement with conventional (fixed frequency) algorithms. The
latter have been shown to miss up to 25 % of fast and slow spindles (Adamczyk et al., 2015; Cox et al.,
2017; Ujma et al., 2015). To allow for the investigation of differences in spindle characteristics, agecomparative research should ensure that the frequency bands applied to define slow and fast spindles
are congruent with age- and person-specific spindle properties. Moreover, frequency definitions
need to be broad enough to capture sleep spindles in their complexity and entirety. Independently of
an individual’s age, person-specific definitions of spindle frequencies form the basis for these
improvements (Adamczyk et al., 2015; Cox et al., 2017; Ujma et al., 2015).

Challenge 5: Topographical disparities in age-related sleep
changes
Age-related alterations in sleep physiology do not show a spatially coherent pattern. We highlight
that alterations in sleep oscillations that are measurable on the scalp do not necessarily reflect an
altered initiation of underlying physiological sleep processes per se, but could rather represent agerelated alterations in structural properties of the brain. Taking into account that intrinsic
characteristics of sleep-specific oscillatory components may be well preserved during aging can
help our understanding of the functionality of sleep in old age.
Across the lifespan, the human brain undergoes complex structural alterations (Buckner, 2004;
Cabeza et al., 2005; Fjell et al., 2013; Fjell and Walhovd, 2010; Raz et al., 2005), which are also
reflected in the topography of the sleep EEG (Buchmann et al., 2011; Carrier et al., 2011; Kurth et al.,
2010; Landolt and Borbély, 2001; Martin et al., 2013; Sprecher et al., 2016). From childhood to
adolescence, along with cortical maturation in frontal brain regions, maximal SWA shifts from
posterior to frontal brain regions (Kurth et al., 2010; Whitford et al., 2007). In old age, frontal brain
regions are particularly prone to age-related structural white and gray matter loss (Giorgio et al.,
2010; Raz and Rodrigue, 2006). As a consequence, age-related decline in spectral EEG power and
amplitude is particularly pronounced over frontal areas (Carrier et al., 2011; Landolt and Borbély,
2001; Mander et al., 2017; Martin et al., 2013; Sprecher et al., 2016).
Topographical shifts in sleep parameters are diverse. For example, in our own data, the
centroparietal prevalence of fast spindle density and amplitude in younger adults was shifted
posterior in older adults, resulting in reduced or even absent age differences over parietal and
occipital regions (Figure 5A and D; Supplementary Figure 2). In contrast, slow spindles and slow
oscillations maintained their frontal dominance in old age. Whereas the amplitude and density of
slow oscillations were globally and uniformly reduced in old age (Figure 5C and F), the density and
amplitude of slow spindles showed most pronounced age-related reductions over frontal areas
(Figure 5B and E). Thus, the extracted oscillatory event or indicator (i.e., slow spindle, fast spindle,
slow oscillation), their derived characteristics (i.e., density, amplitude, and frequency), and not least
an individual’s age interact and influence where, and to what extent, age differences in sleep can be
observed.

Crucially, the topographical heterogeneity of age effects detectable on the scalp level may be
meaningful and indicative of alterations in underlying brain structure and cellular properties. To
illustrate this effect, we tested for the association between gray matter volume and fast spindle
density measured at different electrode sites (separate voxel-vise multiple regression models for each
predictor; see Figure 6; cf. Supplementary Methods; Supplementary Figure 4, Supplementary Table
3). In line with the observed posterior preservation of fast spindles in old age (Figure 4A;
Supplementary Figure 2), fast spindle density at Pz and Oz did not relate to gray matter volume. In
contrast, fast spindle density measured frontally and at Cz, that was most reduced on older adults,
was associated with structural integrity in frontal and temporal brain regions (Figure 6;
Supplementary Figure 4, Supplementary Table 3). In comparison, gray matter clusters for the
association with slow spindle and slow oscillation density were small and less consistent
(Supplementary Figures 5 and 6, Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Based on these analyses

examples, it becomes clear that structural brain integrity does not globally shape the generation and
propagation of all oscillatory components. However, one should note that chronological age, in
general, was associated with global reductions in gray matter volume that were strongest in frontal
brain regions (Figure 6; Supplementary Figure 3, Supplementary Table 2). The extent of structural
brain alterations in aging can thus overshadow more focalized and potentially meaningful structure–
function associations.
To derive a meaningful interpretation of the observed structure–function associations, one
needs to consider that the extent to which we can detect oscillatory events on the scalp depends on
both their generation and propagation. Thus, we can encounter the situation that oscillations are
properly generated, but their propagation to certain brain areas is impaired by altered structural
properties of the involved brain circuits (Landolt and Borbély, 2001; Martin et al., 2013; Nir et al.,
2011; Sprecher et al., 2016). In line with this notion and the gray matter associations reported
above, the maximum of fast spindle density over the posterior cortex has been interpreted in terms
of aggravated fast spindle propagation to frontal and central brain regions that is severely affected
by brain atrophy during aging. In contrast, the generation of sleep spindles is often regarded as less
affected by aging (Crowley et al., 2002; Landolt and Borbély, 2001; Martin et al., 2013; Nir et al.,
2011; Sprecher et al., 2016; see also Box 2). Still, we must acknowledge that the available crosssectional correlative data neither allows us to disentangle whether differences in oscillatory
components stem from disparities in their generation or their propagation, nor whether structural
brain alterations cause, accompany, or result from alterations in sleep physiology. To solve these
questions, longitudinal study designs that identify and track the sources of oscillatory components
and link them to aging changes in structural brain integrity are required.
To conclude, the topographic distinctiveness of age-related sleep alterations is an important but
often overlooked factor in age-comparative sleep studies. With the choice where to study age
differences, age effects can either be maximized or reduced. Hence, deriving measures of EEG
activity from only one derivation, as common in standard sleep recordings, should be avoided
(Mander et al., 2017). To capture regional variation of age effects in the EEG, electrode setups that
can capture hemispherical asymmetry (Sprecher et al., 2016) and allow for a high spatial resolution
should be preferred (ideally at least a 32-electrode setup or even high density EEG). The fact that
sleep parameters are selectively altered over specific brain regions, but not over other areas, casts
doubt on the reported extent of age-related impairments in sleep processes. Brain atrophy likely
results in a diminished and altered generation of certain sleep parameters (Dubé et al., 2015; Mander
et al., 2013), but may also affect the propagation of electrical events that, per se, may be less prone

to age-related changes. Future research should interpret the reported effects with care and provide
solutions to disentangle age-related impairments in slow wave and spindle generation and
propagation. Rather than placing a continued focus on the deficiency of sleep in old age, sleep
studies require a shift towards maintained and intact sleep characteristics to determine altered or
preserved functionality of sleep in old age.

Conclusion
Fundamental changes in human sleep during aging are consistently reported and easy to observe –
but, as discussed in this paper, it is nontrivial to quantify and measure them. Intact sleep and the
functional succession of different sleep states is enabled by the balance of different neurotransmitter
systems (Aston-Jones et al., 2007; Cirelli et al., 2005; Ramm, 1979; Steriade et al., 1990), and
synergistic activity in different cortical and sub-cortical brain regions (Hobson and Pace-Schott,
2002; Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002; Saletin et al., 2013; Steriade et al., 1990). Furthermore, it is
embedded in a system of regulatory circadian and homeostatic processes (Achermann and Borbély,
1999; Dijk et al., 2000). Altogether, the diversity of regulatory mechanisms, reaching from genes
and cells to neurotransmitters and brain networks (Hobson and Pace-Schott; Pace-Schott and
Hobson, 2002), makes sleep susceptible to a wide range of possible interference. In consequence,
the causes and the appearance of age-related changes in sleep are manifold and diverse (Dubé et al.,
2015; Fogel et al., 2012, 2017; Mander et al., 2017; Muehlroth et al., 2019b; Zhong et al., 2019).
Standard criteria applied to measure these alterations are commonly optimized to capture interindividual variance in healthy younger adults but can be severely biased when applied in other
populations. As a result, not all age differences documented via the use of conventional analysis
pipelines capture real alterations in underlying neural processing. We thus stress the need to develop
individually adjusted analytic approaches in order to disentangle true age-dependent effects from
age-independent inter-individual differences. But how could such an age-adjusted research process
work?
We suggest that the basis for research on age-dependent differences in a given (neural) process
is rooted in thorough theoretical considerations that incorporate the complex and dynamic nature of
aging (e.g., Cabeza et al., 2018, 2005; Lindenberger et al., 2006) and the individual as the primary
unit of analysis (Fisher et al., 2018; Grandy et al., 2017; Molenaar and Campbell, 2009; Nesselroade
et al., 2007; Nesselroade and Molenaar, 2016; Rose et al., 2013). Ideally, such a research process
starts out with an exact definition of a neural or physiological phenomenon that we intend to
investigate. For instances we could ask whether the intensity of sleep (in terms of sleep depth) is
reduced in old age. In a next step, potential indicators that mirror the phenomenon of interest along
with its crucial features have to be considered and the most appropriate indicator(s) need(s) to be
selected. In our example, we could decide to use SWA and slow oscillation density as markers of
low-frequency oscillatory activity during sleep that index the depth of sleep (e.g., Achermann and
Borbély, 1999; Bersagliere and Achermann, 2010; Blake and Gerard, 1937). Next, we need to

determine how to best measure the respective indicator. Here, the individual has to be at the center of
the analysis. Inter-individual differences that are irrelevant for our research question and thus introduce
‘noise’ (e.g., differences in anatomical skull properties) should be filtered out by adjusting analytic
detection criteria at the level of the individual person (Karch et al., 2015; Molenaar and Campbell,
2009; Nesselroade et al., 2007; Nesselroade and Molenaar, 2016; Rose et al., 2013). In this way, we
can create the conditions that facilitate an accurate interpretation of remaining inter-individual
differences (Nesselroade et al., 2007). To be as unbiased as possible when comparing heterogeneous
subject groups and individuals, we thus believe that research on sleep and aging should strive to
identify the best possible analysis strategy to study a certain phenomenon of interest – even if this
means moving away from conventional analytic approaches.
Complementarily, we stress the inevitable need to shift research foci from cross-sectional
towards longitudinal studies. The currently available evidence cannot inform about ‘real’ age
changes in sleep (Hertzog and Nesselroade, 2003; Hofer and Sliwinski, 2001; Li and Schmiedek,
2002; Lindenberger and Pötter, 1998; Lindenberger et al., 2011; Overton, 2010; Raz and
Lindenberger, 2011). To disentangle adaptive from maladaptive aging processes, and to identify the
lead-lag relations between age-related alterations in brain structure and sleep, study designs that
follow the same individual across multiple measurement occasions are required (Hofer and Sliwinski,
2001; Li and Schmiedek, 2002; Lindenberger, 2014; Raz and Lindenberger, 2011).
Aside from that, we want to emphasize that age-dependent alterations in sleep physiology
should not necessarily be interpreted in terms of ‘shortage’ or ‘deficiency.’ The brain is an adaptive
organ that changes its structure and function in reaction to mismatches between environmental
demands and organismic supplies (Lövden et al., 2010; Park and Reuter-Lorenz, 2009). First, this
means that not all observed age differences in sleep necessarily indicate a loss (Baltes, 1987; Baltes
et al., 1998). Reduced SWA, for instance, might merely be the consequence of reduced sleep
pressure and an altered need for sleep in old age (Dijk et al., 2000). Second, due to the adaptive
nature of the human brain, persons with very different developmental trajectories and physiological
conditions can display similar sleep patterns (Muehlroth et al., 2019a). By identifying the
similarities among individuals, and specifically among younger and older adults (Nesselroade et al.,
2007), we can determine whether and how sleep is preserved in old age. Moreover, we can
determine whether maintained sleep physiology is also reflected on the level of behavioral outcomes
(Cabeza et al., 2018; Muehlroth et al., 2019a; Nyberg et al., 2012; Nyberg and Pudas, 2019; Park and
Reuter-Lorenz, 2009). Research that shifts its focus towards the successful retention of sleep
characteristics represents the foundation to gain a mechanistic understanding of the consequences

entailed in altered sleep physiology. This is the basis for identifying the diagnostic value of sleep
changes (Ferrarelli et al., 2019; Grandy et al., 2013; Prinz, 1977).
Finally, we want to point out that understanding sleep neurophysiological dynamics in their
entirety ultimately requires taking a holistic view on sleep as alternating states of NREM and REM
sleep (Conte and Ficca, 2013; Prerau et al., 2017; Scullin and Gao, 2018). Beyond a continued focus
on NREM sleep, theories and analysis methods should take the cyclic nature of NREM and REM
sleep into account and consider their dynamic interaction (e.g., by investigating stage transition
rates, probabilities, and their temporal pattern; cf. Kishi et al., 2011; Schlemmer et al., 2015; Yetton
et al., 2018).
Recent attempts to establish sleep as a novel biomarker and treatment target for Alzheimer’s
disease have instantly evoked a massive rise in research on sleep and aging (Ju et al., 2014; Mander
et al., 2016; Noble and Spires-Jones, 2019; Vaou et al., 2018). Methodological considerations,
though, call for a clarification of what we want to measure and how we can best assess the
respective phenomena. Improved methodological approaches will clearly speed up the search for a
mechanistic understanding of the association between sleep and cognition in aged individuals.

Box 3. Methodological advice for age-comparative sleep studies
1. Closely inspect your sleep EEG data visually. Knowing what the data looks like will ease
your understanding of what to consider and what to adjust in your analyses.
2. Analyses should focus on micro-structural rather than macro-structural sleep features.
3. Define the neural process of interest as well as possible. Avoid proxies wherever possible.
4. Consider that seemingly similar measures (e.g., frequency, amplitude, density, power of the
very same spindle event) can reflect very different physiological and neuronal properties. Be
precise on which features you extract and interpret them carefully.
5. NREM sleep forms a continuum. Acknowledge that neurophysiological processes that are
captured by sleep spindles and slow oscillations are present during both stage 2 sleep and
SWS.
6. Use individually adjusted algorithms (with regard to amplitude and frequency) for sleep
oscillation detection.
7. Use electrode setups that enable topographical comparisons. Try to incorporate the
mechanisms that are driving topographical heterogeneity in age effects into your theories and
methods (e.g., by carrying out structural brain imaging or source localization techniques in
addition).
8. Instead of focusing on deficits only, consider what is intact or maintained in old age. Do your
very best to apply age-adjusted methodology and comparisons.

Overview of data
In the present article, we report on data from 29 healthy younger (range: 19–28 years, Mage = 23.55
years, SDage = 2.58; 16 females) and 34 healthy older adults (range: 63–74 years, Mage = 68.85
years, SDage = 3.11; 15 females) whose sleep was monitored in two consecutive nights at their
homes using ambulatory polysomnography (PSG). Analyses involving structural magnet resonance
imaging (MRI) data, were based on data from 29 younger adults (Mage = 23.66 years, SDage = 2.6;
17 female) and 32 of the older adults (Mage = 68.78 years, SDage = 2.94; 14 female). All participants
were right-handed native German speakers with no reported history of psychiatric or neurological
disease, or any use of psychoactive medication. Older participants were screened for cognitive
deficits using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; M = 29.24, SD = 1.12, range: 26–30;
Folstein et al., 1975). General subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989).
All displayed data were collected as part of a research project investigating age differences in
the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of associative memories (for more details on the
experimental procedure, see Muehlroth et al., 2019a,b; Fandakova et al., 2018; Sander et al., 2019;
Sommer et al., 2019). Participants’ sleep was monitored in two successive nights before and after
engaging in an extensive associative learning task. An adaptation night prior to the first experimental
night familiarized participants with the PSG procedure. MRI data were collected after the second
experimental night. The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Deutsche
Gesellschaft für Psychologie (DGPs) and conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Human
Development in Berlin. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants before study
participation.

Sleep data acquisition
Sleep was recorded in two consecutive nights using an ambulatory PSG device (SOMNOscreen
plus; SOMNOmedics, Germany). Eight scalp electrodes were attached according to the
international 10–20 system for electrode positioning (Fz, F3, F4, C3, C4, Cz, Pz, Oz; Jasper, 1958;
Oostenveld and Praamstra, 2001) along with two electrodes on the mastoids A1 and A2, which later
served as the offline reference. All impedances were kept below 6 kΩ. Data were recorded using Cz
as the online reference for all EEG derivations and AFz as ground. Additionally, a bilateral

electrooculogram (EOG) was assessed. Two submental electromyogram channels (EMG) were
positioned left and right, below the labial angle, and referenced against one chin electrode.
Electrical activity of the heart was recorded using two electrocardiogram channels (ECG). EEG
channels were recorded between 0.2–75 Hz using a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter and a
sampling rate of 128 Hz, with a manufacturers high-passed filter at 0.2 Hz and a low-pass filter at
35.0 Hz.

EEG pre-processing
Data was first preprocessed using BrainVision Analyzer 2.1 (Brain Products, Germany). Here, all
EEG channels were re-referenced against the average of A1 and A2. To visually score the sleep data
according to the standard criteria suggested by the American Academy for Sleep Medicine (AASM;
Iber et al., 2007), the data were filtered using their recommended settings (EEG: 0.3–35 Hz; EOG:
0.3–35 Hz; EMG: 10–100 Hz). A Notch (50 Hz) filter was applied to the EMG and EOG
derivations to remove external electrical interference. Afterwards, sleep stages 1 and 2, SWS, REM
sleep, awakenings, and body movements were visually scored in 30-second epochs using SchlafAus
1.4 (Gais & Werner, Lübeck, Germany). Total sleep time (TST) was calculated as the time spent in
stage 1, stage 2, SWS, and REM sleep. Wake after sleep onset (WASO) was defined as the time
participants were awake between sleep onset and final morning awakening.
Further analyses of the sleep EEG data were conducted using Matlab R2014b (Mathworks
Inc., Sherbom, MA), the open-source toolbox Fieldtrip (Oostenveld et al., 2011), and custom-made
code. Bad EEG channels were visually rejected. For the remaining channels, artefact detection was
implemented on 1-second segments. Segments that were visually identified as body movement and
those that exhibited amplitude differences of more than 500 V were excluded. To further exclude
segments that strongly deviated from the observed overall amplitude distribution, mean amplitude
differences for each segment were z-standardized within each channel. Segments with a z-score of
more than 5 in any of the channels were excluded. Code and sample data to reproduce the whole
EEG analysis pipeline will be available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zur2b/).

Slow oscillation detection
Slow oscillation detection at frontal electrodes was implemented based on previously established
algorithms (Mölle et al., 2002; Ngo et al., 2013; cf. Muehlroth et al., 2019b). For NREM epochs
(i.e., stage 2 sleep, and SWS), EEG data was band-pass filtered between 0.2 and 4 Hz using a 6thorder Butterworth filter (in forward and backward directions to prevent phase distortions). The

whole signal was then divided into negative and positive half-waves that were separated by zerocrossings of the filtered signal. The combination of a negative half wave with the succeeding
positive half wave was considered a putative slow oscillation when its frequency was between 0.5
and 1 Hz. The amplitude of each potential slow oscillation was calculated as the distance between
the slow oscillation trough and positive peak, defined as its maximal negative and positive potential,
respectively. Selection of real slow oscillations was then performed in two ways:
1. Adaptive amplitude thresholds were defined separately for each participant: Putative slow
oscillations exceeding a trough of 1.25 times the mean trough of all putative slow oscillations
as well as an amplitude of 1.25 times the average amplitude of all potential slow oscillations,
were considered real slow oscillations (Ngo et al., 2013).
2. As an alternative detection criterion, fixed amplitude thresholds were defined: Putative slow
oscillations exceeding a trough of –40 µV as well as an amplitude of 75 V, were selected
(Carrier et al., 2011; Dubé et al., 2015). Only artefact-free slow oscillations were considered
in further analyses.

Spindle detection
Spindles were detected using an established automated algorithm (Klinzing et al., 2016, 2018;
Mölle et al., 2011). For NREM epochs (stage 2 sleep, and SWS), EEG data were band-pass filtered
using a 6th-order Butterworth filter (in forward and backward directions) between 9 and 12.5 Hz
for the detection of slow spindles, and between 12.5 and 16 Hz for fast spindles, respectively (Cox
et al., 2017; Ujma et al., 2015). The root-mean-square (RMS) representation of the signal was
calculated using a sliding window of 200 ms at each sample point. Afterwards, the RMS signal was
smoothed by applying a moving average of 200 ms. To increase sensitivity and specificity of our
algorithm (Coppieters ’t Wallant et al., 2016), we accounted for individual differences in EEG
amplitude by anchoring the spindle identification to individually determined amplitude thresholds.
A potential spindle was tagged if the amplitude of the smoothed RMS signal exceeded its mean by
1.5 SD of the filtered signal for 0.5 to 3 seconds. Spindles with boundaries closer than 0.25 seconds
were eventually merged in the following way: In each processing run, starting with the smallest
boundary difference, two spindles were merged if the resulting spindle event remained within the
time limit of 3 seconds. As soon as a spindle was combined with another one, it could not be
merged with another spindle in the same run again. Only if all boundary differences were revised

and no further merging of putative spindles was possible, the new resulting spindle events were
processed in a next run. Starting again with the smallest boundary difference, two putative spindles
could be merged if the merged event remained within the required time limit. These runs were
repeated until no further merging was possible. Finally, only spindles that did not overlap with
previously marked artefact segments were considered real spindles.

Spectral analysis
To derive whole-night characteristics of spectral EEG power (cf. Figure 2), we applied multitaper
spectral analyses at electrode Cz (Mitra and Pesaran, 1999; Prerau et al., 2017) with frequency limits of
0.2 and 30 Hz and a frequency resolution of 1 Hz. Raw data was segmented into 30-second epochs
that were spaced at 5-second intervals. A total of 29 discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS)
tapers was applied. Power spectral analyses of the sleep EEG data were conducted, to obtain finergrained indicators of neural processes during deep NREM sleep. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)
with frequency limits between 0.5 and 30 Hz was applied on 5-second intervals using a Hanning
function with no overlap and averaged across all NREM sleep (i.e., stage 2 sleep, and SWS). Logtransformed power spectra were derived for all channels. Slow-wave activity (SWA), defined as
spectral power in the delta frequency range (0.5–4.5 Hz), was calculated for NREM epochs and
normalized at the total power of the whole spectrum to minimize confounding effects and frequencyunspecific differences in EEG amplitudes (e.g., Dannhauer et al., 2011; Frodl et al., 2001; Leissner
et al., 1970).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using RStudio 1.0.53 (RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA). For each
subject, sleep estimates were averaged between the two experimental nights. Due to non-normal
data distributions, we calculated non-parametric Mann-Whitney U Tests for independent samples
and reported median and quartile values of the variables o identify age differences in sleep
architecture and the expressed sleep oscillations between younger and older adults. Effect sizes
were quantified by calculating Cohen’s d along with its 95 % confidence interval. Mixed factorial
ANOVAs with the between factor AGE GROUP and the within factor CHANNEL were calculated
to investigate the topographical differences in age-related sleep alterations. Post-hoc testing, again,
was conducted using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U Tests for independent samples as well as
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for matched pairs. Associations between variables were estimated using
Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient. The agreement between different sleep variables was

quantified by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC; Koo and Li, 2016) based on a
two-way mixed effects model and consistency (= ICC(3,k)). To derive the test-retest reliability of the
extracted sleep variables between the two consecutive nights, ICC calculation on the non-averaged
sleep data was based on a two-way mixed effects model and absolute agreement (= ICC(2,k)).
Significance levels were set to  = .05 and tested two-sided. We controlled statistical significance for
multiple comparisons by Bonferroni-correcting the -value and dividing it by the number of
performed comparisons.

Structural MRI data acquisition and analyses
Whole-brain MRI data was acquired with a Siemens Magnetom 3T TimTrio machine. A highresolution T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (TR = 2500 ms, TE = 4.77 ms, FOV = 256 mm, voxel
size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3) was collected from each participant. To quantify gray matter volume voxelwise, we applied voxel-based morphometry (VBM; Ashburner and Friston, 2000) using Statistical
Parametric Mapping Software (SPM12, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and the Computational
Anatomy Toolbox (CAT 12, http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat). Images were normalized to Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) space and segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal
fluid. Data were then modulated, i.e., corrected by the volume changes due to spatial normalization.
For this, each voxel value was multiplied with the Jacobian determinant derived from the spatial
normalization step. Afterwards images were smoothed with a 8 mm full width at half maximum
(FWHM) kernel. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was estimated by summing volume of gray matter,
white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid.
To derive the association between gray matter volume, age, and specific sleep variables, voxelvise multiple regression models were implemented. For each subject, sleep estimates were averaged
between the two experimental nights. All regression models were controlled for inter-individual
differences in TIV by entering TIV as a covariate into the model. For masking, an absolute
threshold of .02 was used. A family-wise error (FWE) correction was applied to all statistical maps,
and as set to .05. Further, we deployed a FWE-corrected cluster extent threshold of p < .05 and k
>100 as well as a correction for nonstationary smoothness. Finally, we used the xjView toolbox
(http://www.alivelearn.net/xjview/) to plot the resulting statistical t-maps onto the Ch2bet MNI
template and to derive cluster labels.

Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficients within and across age groups were calculated
between the different indicators (corresponding p-values in brackets). All slow oscillation
characteristics were derived using individually adjusted amplitude thresholds. The distribution of
the respective variable within younger (orange) and older (blue) is displayed on the diagonal.
Correlation coefficients and corresponding scatter plots are displayed in the upper right and lower left
triangle respectively. OA: older adults; SO: slow oscillation; SWA: slow-wave activity; SWS: slowwave sleep; YA: younger adults.

Supplementary Figure 2. Log-transformed EEG power during NREM sleep. (A) In younger adults
(YA) a clear peak in the fast spindle frequency range (12.5–16 Hz; shaded in dark gray) is observed
in centroparietal electrodes. Frontal channels locally peak in lower frequencies at the transition
from the slow (9–12.5 Hz, shaded in light gray) to fast spindle band. (B) In older adults (OA) we
observe the same fast spindle power peak, but in Pz only. (C) For each age group the average power
spectrum is depicted with its 95 % bootstrap confidence interval (500 bootstrap samples). Overall,
the power spectra are flatter in OA (blue) than in YA (orange). YA show a stronger fast spindle
power peak (shaded in dark grey) and higher power values in low frequencies (0–9 Hz) compared to
OA. Note that, overall, confidence intervals are narrow. OA: older adults; YA: younger adults.

No significant cluster

Note. The table lists cluster size along with the cluster’s peak intensity (maximal t-value, FWE-corrected) and
corresponding MNI coordinates. Anatomical classification is based on the respective peak voxel. Reported clusters
are significant with a FWE-corrected voxel threshold of p < .05, a FWE-corrected cluster extent threshold of p <
.05 and k > 100, and corrected for nonstationary smoothness. See Supplementary Figure 7 for the cluster
depiction.
