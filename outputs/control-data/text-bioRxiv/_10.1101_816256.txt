Abstract (149 words)
Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is essential during development and in organ physiology. In
the canonical pathway, Hh binding to Patched (PTCH) relieves the inhibition of
Smoothened (SMO). Yet, PTCH may also perform SMO-independent functions. While
the PTCH homolog PTC-3 is essential in C. elegans, worms lack SMO, providing an
excellent model to probe non-canonical PTCH function. Here, we show that PTC-3 is
a cholesterol transporter. ptc-3(RNAi) leads to accumulation of intracellular cholesterol
and defects in ER structure and lipid droplet formation. These phenotypes were
accompanied by a reduction in acyl chain (FA) length and desaturation. ptc-3(RNAi)induced lethality, fat storage and ER morphology defects were rescued by reducing
dietary cholesterol. We provide evidence that cholesterol accumulation modulates the
function of nuclear hormone receptors such as of the PPARa homolog NHR-49 and
NHR-181, and affects FA composition. Our data uncover a novel role for PTCH in
organelle structure maintenance and fat metabolism.

Introduction
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is crucial during animal development and has
also demonstrated roles independent of development stages. The Hh receptor PTCH
is among the most mutated tumor suppressors

1

and more specifically, PTCH1

mutations are the cause of the Gorlin Syndrome 2. In the classical Hh signaling
pathway, PTCH inhibits the plasma membrane G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
smoothened (SMO). Upon Hh binding to PTCH, this inhibition is relieved, and SMO
can activate a downstream signaling cascade. The mechanism by which PTCH
inhibits SMO was enigmatic for a long time because PTCH represses SMO without
direct contact 3. PTCH1 was shown to be able to transport cholesterol 4–6 which in turn
will directly activate SMO7, a finding, which was supported by recent structural
analyses 1,8–10. The structures suggest that Hh inhibits PTCH transporter function and
hence plasma membrane cholesterol levels could increase. Such an increase of
cholesterol might be sensed through the sterol sensing domain in SMO and thereby
activate the GPCR. As PTCH may mainly function as a cholesterol transporter, it might
also affect other signaling pathways. In fact, in recent years SMO-independent PTCH
signaling has been reported

11–14

. However, the mechanistic understanding of these

non-canonical Hh signaling pathways remains largely unknown.
Caenorhabditis elegans expresses two PTCH homologs, PTC-1 and PTC-3,
which are essential for development and survival 15–17. While PTC-1 function appears
to be mostly restricted to the germline, PTC-3 is expressed in somatic tissues

18–20

.

No clear SMO homolog is encoded in the genome. In addition, some of the other
downstream targets of the canonical Hh signaling pathway are also missing. In fact, it
was proposed that SMO and those components were specifically lost during evolution
in nematodes

15,21–23

. For example, SUFU is not conserved and the homolog of the

transcription factor Gli, TRA-1, is involved in sex determination and gonad
development in males and hermaphrodites

24

. Therefore, C. elegans provides an

excellent model to study non-canonical, SMO-independent Hh signaling pathways, in
particular in somatic tissues. To dissect SMO-independent PTCH functions, we
concentrated on PTC-3, which is expressed in somatic tissues, in particular in the
hypodermis, glia and gut

20

. We found that reduction of PTC-3 levels causes the

accumulation of intracellular cholesterol and reduction in poly unsaturated fatty acids

(PUFAs). Moreover, the endoplasmic reticulum lost most of its reticulate tubular form
and developed elaborate sheet structures in the intestine. This effect in turn strongly
impaired lipid droplet biogenesis, resulting in the inability of the animal to store fat.
Reduction of dietary cholesterol rescued fat storage defects, the ER morphology
defects, and improved development and survival in ptc-3(RNAi) animals. Cholesterol
levels influence nuclear hormone receptor activity such as of the PPARa homolog
NHR-49, which is involved in the regulation of FA synthesis. Thus, our data
demonstrate that PTCH also controls intracellular cholesterol levels in C. elegans.
Moreover, we show that PTCH thereby impinges on FA metabolism, organellar
structure and fat storage capacity.

Results
PTC-3 has cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions and is required for
lipid storage in the intestine.
In order to understand the function of PTCH proteins in C. elegans, we decided first to
revisit the phenotypes caused by the depletion of the somatically expressed PTC-3.
Like its mammalian homolog, ptc-3 is essential for development. Consistently, it has
been reported that ptc-3(RNAi) results in growth, molting and vulva morphogenesis
defects

17,18

. Given the essential role of PTCH in development, we started the

knockdown by RNAi only at the L2 stage of development, allowing the worms to
progress further in development and even some to reach adulthood. In addition to the
previously reported phenotypes, we noticed that the ptc-3(RNAi) animals were much
paler than their mock-treated counterparts (Fig. 1A). Pale worms are an indication for
defects in fat storage. C. elegans has a much simpler body plan than humans and
hence some C. elegans organs take over more functions. For example, the worm
intestine has paracrine functions, and also serves also as the fat storage organ

25

.

Thus, in a simplified view, the C. elegans intestine represents the functional equivalent
of the human intestine, adipose tissue and liver. To test whether PTC-3 was expressed
in the gut as indicated by genome-wide expression analyses 20, we raised antibodies
against PTC-3 (Fig. S1A). Those antibodies decorated the apical membrane of gut
epithelial cells, while no plasma membrane signal was detected in oocytes, consistent
with the notion that PTC-3 is present only in somatic tissues (Fig. 1B). This localization
was confirmed with a GFP-tagged PTC-3 (Fig. S1B).
To determine which phenotype is dependent on intestinal PTC-3, we performed
a gut-specific knockdown of PTC-3

26

. ptc-3(RNAigut) animals were still paler and

thinner than mock-treated animals (Fig. 1C). Moreover, vulva morphogenesis defects
were also observed upon the ptc-3(RNAigut) regime, indicating that PTC-3 has cell
autonomous and non-autonomous functions.
As outlined above, pale phenotypes are often associated with lipid storage
defects in worms 25,27. Nile Red staining indeed showed a reduction in lipid content in
ptc-3(RNAi) animals (Fig. 1D and E). Of note, this reduction was observed in the
intestine, but not in the germline, in accordance with the absence of PTC-3 expression
in oocytes. A drawback of Nile Red staining is that autofluorescence in the intestine

caused by lysosome-related organelles (LROs) is also potentially measured at the
same time, which may confound the results. Therefore, we turned to Coherent antiStokes Raman Scattering Microscopy (CARS), a dye-free method recognized for
accurate in vivo lipid detection in worms

28

. This analysis confirmed the Nile Red

staining, and we observed an about 50% reduction in lipid content (Fig. 1F and G),
indicating that we can use Nile Red for further analysis. The CARS signal did not
overlap with the autofluorescence of LROs (Fig. S1C). We conclude that loss of PTC3 causes a reduction in fat storage in the intestine.
PTC-3 is a cholesterol transporter
Recent data suggested that mammalian PTCH1 acts as a cholesterol transporter
1,5,6,8–10

. To investigate, whether PTC-3 shares the function of PTCH1 as cholesterol

transporter, we first expressed PTC-3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which does not
contain any cholesterol

29

and measured cholesterol efflux from cells using TopFluor

cholesterol in pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 2A). PTC-3 expressing yeast cells
exported cholesterol significantly faster out of the cell than control cells, similar to what
has been observed for mammalian PTCH15. This efflux capacity was dependent on
an active permease domain, since a mutation in the permease domain

18

, ptc-3D697A,

strongly reduced the cholesterol efflux. The ptc-3D697A mutation has been reported to
cause larval lethality in worms

18

, establishing that cholesterol efflux is the essential

function of PTCH. Next, we repeated the pulse-chase experiment in worms. While in
mock treated worms, TopFluor cholesterol was present mostly in the gut lumen, it was
still strongly accumulated in the intestine in ptc-3(RNAi) worms after the washout,
further demonstrating the role as cholesterol transporter (Fig. 2B). Finally, we
measured sterol levels by mass spectrometry. Cholesterol levels were increased in
ptc-3(RNAi) worms, while 7-dihydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and lophenol levels were
decreased (Fig. 2C). 7-DHC and lophenol are downstream products of cholesterol in
worms, indicating that cholesterol metabolism might also be affected by ptc-3(RNAi).
Taken together our data strongly suggest that PTC-3, like PTCH1, is a cholesterol
transporter at the plasma membrane.

Cholesterol accumulates predominantly in the apical membrane in the intestine
of ptc-3(RNAi) animals
Cholesterol accumulates in ptc-3(RNAi) worms because it cannot be pumped out of
the cells. In addition, cholesterol is not efficiently metabolized into 7-DHC and lophenol
under those conditions. We speculated where the excess of cholesterol would reside
in the cell. First, we used filipin, which binds specifically to cholesterol. While we could
barely detect any filipin staining in mock-treated animals, ptc-3(RNAi) worms showed
a strong fluorescent signal in the apical membrane in the intestine and also some
appreciable increase in intracellular fluorescence (Fig. 2D). To corroborate this finding,
we next employed two versions of the domain 4 of perfringolysin fused to mCherry
probe (D4-mCherry), YDA and YQDA, which have different sensitivities in the
detection of cholesterol 30–32. We expressed the probes constitutively in the C. elegans
intestine and analyzed their cellular distribution. Similar to the filipin staining, the
mCherry signal increased in the plasma membrane for both probes in ptc-3(RNAi)
animals compared to mock treated controls. (Fig. 2D and E). Thus, the strongest
cholesterol accumulation is observed in the apical membrane in the intestine of ptc3(RNAi) animals. We envisage that cholesterol levels are also increased, albeit to a
lesser extent, in intracellular membranes.
Low dietary cholesterol rescues ptc-3(RNAi) phenotypes
It is plausible that the cholesterol accumulation is the cause for the observed
phenotypes in ptc-3(RNAi) animals. C. elegans is unable to synthesize cholesterol and
must ingest it through the diet

33

. In the lab, cholesterol is provided in the growth

medium. Strikingly, when we omitted cholesterol from the growth medium, ptc-3(RNAi)
worms developed much better, with 89% reaching adulthood (Fig. 3A and B).
Moreover, the pale phenotype was strongly reduced, and lipid storage was improved
(Fig. 3C and D). Thus, reducing cholesterol accumulation rescued developmental as
well as fat storage defects in ptc-3(RNAi) worms. Since cholesterol conversion into 7DHC was also impaired, we asked whether increasing the levels of 7-DHC would
likewise rescue the ptc-3(RNAi) phenotypes. However, addition of 7-DHC did not
alleviate the ptc-3(RNAi) phenotype (Fig. S2). We conclude that most of the ptc3(RNAi) phenotypes are linked to the regulation of intracellular cholesterol levels.
Moreover, the accumulation of cholesterol, and not the inability of the ptc-3(RNAi)
animals to process cholesterol efficiently, appears to be detrimental for the organism.

Lipid droplet biogenesis and ER morphology are impaired upon ptc-3(RNAi)
Cellular fat is mostly stored in lipid droplets, which originate from the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). In ptc-3(RNAi) animals, we observed defects in fat storage dependent
on the intracellular cholesterol levels. Thus, we investigated whether the ER was
affected by loss of PTC-3 function using intestinally expressed TRAM-GFP. We
observed morphological alterations in the ER in ptc-3(RNAi) animals, which were,
however, hard to interpret (Fig. S3). To gain a better understanding of the phenotype,
we performed electron microscopy. Not unexpectedly, given the fat storage defect,
lipid droplets were essentially absent in ptc-3(RNAi) intestines (Fig 4A). Even more
strikingly, the ER had lost most of its reticulate structures and formed long lines. Such
long lines in 2D are indicative of ER sheets in 3D

34

. We used focused ion beam

scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and machine learning algorithms to obtain
information on the ER structure in 3D. Indeed, the reticulate, tubular structure of the
ER was dramatically reduced in ptc-3(RNAi) when compared to mock; instead
enormous ER-sheets and clusters were formed (Fig. 4B, Fig. S4, movies S1 and S2).
Taken together, our data so far suggest that the cholesterol accumulation, due to the
absence of PTC-3, impairs ER structure and thereby lipid droplet formation. If the
cellular cholesterol levels were indeed the critical factor, then reducing dietary
cholesterol in ptc-3(RNAi) animals should alleviate the ER phenotype. Indeed, ptc3(RNAi) animals raised on low cholesterol diet displayed reticulated ER and lipid
droplets (Fig. 4A). Thus, cellular cholesterol levels strongly influence ER morphology
and function. At this point we were unable to determine whether this effect is direct or
indirect. Even though, most of the cholesterol accumulated in the apical plasma
membrane in ptc-3(RNAi) animals, we cannot exclude, that there is also an
accumulation of cholesterol in the ER. Unfortunately, filipin bleaches very fast, and the
D4-mCherry sensors are present throughout the cell, so that we are only be able to
detect very strong local accumulations. Still, the inability of the ER membrane to form
lipid droplets and the sheet structure might be linked to the increased membrane
bending rigidity.
Fatty acid acyl chain length and desaturation is reduced in ptc-3(RNAi) animals
To test this hypothesis, we first performed a simple experiment, in which we modulated
the growth temperature. Membrane fluidity increases as a function of temperature,
while membrane bending rigidity decreases. Consistent with our hypothesis, the

development and viability of ptc-3(RNAi) animals were improved at an elevated
temperature (Fig. 5A and B).
Another factor, which determines the stiffness or fluidity of membranes is the
saturation of the acyl chains of lipids. Saturated acyl chains are considered to be
relatively straight, allowing a high packing rate of lipids accompanied with the
generation of an ordered phase and a reduction in fluidity. In contrast, desaturated
fatty acids correlate with less dense packing, higher membrane fluidity and lower
bending rigidity. Therefore, we performed lipidomics and determined the level of
phospholipid acyl chain saturation upon ptc-3(RNAi). We did not observe any major
difference in the headgroup composition of the most important lipid species (Fig. 5C).
In contrast, we detected a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in ptc3(RNAi) worms as there was a marked decrease in acyl chain length and desaturation
(Fig. 5D). This reduction in PUFAs is not due to a general reduction in lipids upon ptc3(RNAi) compared to mock treatment, but rather reflects a shift from PUFAs to more
saturated, shorter FAs. This shift towards more saturated FAs supports our hypothesis
that the cholesterol accumulation contributes, directly or indirectly, to the
morphological changes of the ER membrane.
NHR-49 and FAT-7 overexpression rescue ptc-3(RNAi) animals
The reduction in PUFAs could potentially be due to inhibition or lower expression of
fatty acid desaturases and elongases. A potential candidate to check this hypothesis
is the desaturase FAT-7, which appeared to be down-regulated during heat adaptation
to counteract the increase in membrane fluidity at high temperature 35. Overexpression
of FAT-7 in the intestine resulted in better survival of ptc-3(RNAi) animals (Fig. 6A and
B). The rescued animals were darker than their counterparts (Fig. 6A), suggesting that
they were able to store fat. FAT-7 expression is regulated by the PPARa homolog
NHR-49

36,37

. Similar to what we had observed for FAT-7 overexpression, increasing

intestinal NHR-49 levels improved survival of ptc-3(RNAi) animals (Fig. 6A and B).
Rescue of survival due to NHR-49 overexpression was accompanied by restoration of
fat storage (Fig. 6A-D), suggesting that NHR-49 is a major downstream effector of
PTC-3. NHR-49 partners with NHR-80, a homolog of mammalian HNF4, to regulate
fatty acid desaturation 36. However, overexpression of NHR-80 did not rescue the ptc-

3(RNAi) phenotype (Fig. 6A and B). Our data are consistent with the notion that NHR49 and FAT-7 are modulators of membrane bending rigidity.
Loss of NHR-181 rescues the high cholesterol induced phenotypes in ptc3(RNAi) animals
Nuclear hormone receptors often act context-dependent. Therefore, we wondered,
whether other NHRs or the loss thereof may contribute to the ptc-3(RNAi) phenotype.
NHR-8, the C. elegans ortholog of vertebrate liver X and vitamin D receptors, was also
shown to influence cholesterol levels and fat content 38,39. Since nhr-8(RNAi) animals
contained more fat

39

, we speculated whether loss of NHR-8 could rescue the ptc-

3(RNAi) phenotype. However, we could not detect any rescue (Fig. S5A). This result
may not have been so unexpected since nhr-8 mutants contain less unsaturated fatty
acids

39

. Overexpression of NHR-8 still did not alleviated ptc-3(RNAi) defects (Fig.

S5B), indicating that NHR-8 and PTC-3 act independently.
C. elegans expresses 278 nuclear hormone receptors. To identify possible
NHRs important in a PTC-3-dependent pathway, we turned to genome-wide
expression data during development. C. elegans goes through 4 larval stages before
reaching adulthood (Fig. 6E). Each transition from one larval stage to the next is
accompanied by the synthesis of a new, larger cuticula, in a process referred to as
molting. Genome-wide RNAseq and Riboseq throughout C. elegans development
revealed an oscillatory behavior of gene expression for many genes 40 (Fig. 6E). Given
the general role of PTC-3 in development and the observed cuticle defects upon ptc3(RNAi), it was not surprising to find that PTC-3 expression also oscillated (Fig. 6F).
However, NHR-49 expression remained constant during development (Fig. 6F). We
then asked, which other NHRs would oscillate in a similar manner as PTC-3. Three
NHRs emerged as possible candidates: NHR-41, NHR-168 and NHR-181 (Fig. 6G).
We hypothesized that the expression levels of the NHRs should be responsive to
cholesterol levels. Of the three, only expression levels of the HNF4 homolog NHR-181
were upregulated in high cholesterol i.e. ptc-3(RNAi), and reduced under low
cholesterol conditions (Fig. 6H). More importantly, knockdown of NHR-181 rescued
the ptc-3(RNAi) induced lethality to a similar extent than overexpression of NHR-49,
irrespective of the cholesterol present in the medium (Fig. 6B and I). Moreover, fat
content was restored to a similar extent (Fig. 6J and K, compare J and C). Taken

together, our data imply that NHR-49 positively and NHR-181 negatively regulate
membrane bending properties and fat storage in response to high cholesterol levels.

Discussion
We explored the role of the C. elegans PTCH homolog, PTC-3, in the absence of the
classical functional hedgehog signaling pathway. The function of PTCH proteins is
conserved from C. elegans to man because similar to what has been proposed for
mammalian PTCH 1,6,41, PTC-3 is a cholesterol transporter, which exports cholesterol
out of the cell. PTC-3 appears to be the major cholesterol transporter in the apical
plasma membrane in the C. elegans intestine, since knock-down of PTC-3 resulted in
strong intracellular cholesterol accumulation, most notably in the apical plasma
membrane.
As a consequence of the cholesterol accumulation, the balance of tubular and
sheet-like ER was strongly skewed towards sheet structures (Fig. 7). Moreover, lipid
droplet synthesis, which originates at the ER was greatly reduced. We propose that
the ER membranes in ptc-3(RNAi) animals have an increased bending rigidity, which
does not allow bulging out of lipid droplets. Whether triglycerides still accumulate
within the lipid bilayer remains unclear because their detection in the ER membrane
was not possible. However, we observed an increase in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid acyl chains (MUFAs) at the expense of polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs) upon knockdown of PTC-3. This imbalance towards shorter and
saturated acyl chains should also increase lipid packing and increase membrane
bending rigidity. This effect would then be intensified by the accumulation of
cholesterol in intracellular membranes, which would furthermore promote membrane
stiffness.
While the increase of membrane bending rigidity is probably sufficient to inhibit
lipid droplet formation, vesicle formation at the ER and the Golgi apparatus may not
be as strongly affected by cholesterol accumulation and the increase in MUFAs
because we still observed stacked Golgi apparatus by electron microscopy (Fig S6).
The difference between lipid droplet formation and vesicle budding is that the COPII
coat can bend the entire lipid bilayer

42

, while the triglycerides must deform the

membrane from within and push the lipid bilayer apart, a process, which might be less

energetically favorable. The COPII coat can thus probably exert the force necessary
to bend the ER membranes in the mutant.
However, the cholesterol accumulation may not only have a structural role in
stiffening of membranes, together with MUFAs and saturated fatty acid acyl chains. It
was shown previously that cholesterol can act as a hormone in C. elegans

43–45

. In

support of this notion, we observed cuticular defects with intestine-specific knockdown
on PTC-3, indicating that there are cell non-autonomous effects of ptc-3(RNAi). Given
that PTC-3 is a cholesterol transporter, we speculate that the increased cholesterol
levels are the causative of the cuticle defects. Moreover, cholesterol may also change
the transcriptional program and reduce the expression of genes required for FA
desaturation and elongation. In fact, overexpression of the PPARa homolog NHR-49
rescued the ptc-3(RNAi)-induced fat storage and developmental arrest phenotype. In
mammalian cells, PPARa requires PUFAs for activation

35,46

. We hypothesize that

reduced PUFA levels downregulate NHR-49 activity, which could be compensated by
the overexpression of NHR-49. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, the
interaction between NHR-49 and NHR-80, which are jointly controlling FA elongation
and desaturation 36, would be disrupted by high cholesterol levels and NHR-49 would
instead team up with NHR-181. This complex could then negatively regulate FAT and
ELO gene expression when cholesterol levels increase in the cell. A circumstantial
argument that put weight on this latter possibility is that both NHR-80 and NHR-181
are homologs of mammalian HNF4 proteins. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the
exchange of one HNF4 like molecule for another would shift the activity of NHR-49
from promoting elongation and desaturation to repressing these processes.
Interestingly, a C-terminal truncation in Ptch1 in adult mice led to a reduction of white
fat tissue and PPARg levels, suggesting that the SMO-independent pathway we
uncovered might be conserved in mammals 47.
NHR-49 and NHR-181 appear to be specific downstream effectors of PTC-3
activity levels, as down regulating NHR-8 did not improve PTC-3-dependent
phenotypes. Likewise, SREB, which is a major responder to alteration in cellular
cholesterol levels and which has been shown to regulate the expression of fatty acid
elongases and desaturases in mammalian cells 48. However, knockdown of PTC-3 did
not affect the nuclear localization of the C. elegans SREB homolog SBP-1 (Fig. S5C).
However, NHR-49 activity clearly is affected by increased cholesterol levels since

phenotypes.
We used C. elegans to reveal potential ancestral functions of PTCH family
proteins because it lacks smoothened and other canonical hedgehog signaling
pathway components, which have been lost during evolution 22,23. In fact, it has been
proposed that PTCH and related proteins such NPC1 and dispatched evolved
separately from smoothened

49

. PTCH belongs to the family of RND transporters,

which are already present in bacteria. For most bacterial RNDs the substrates are
unknown. However, the family most related to PTCH transports hopanoids, which are
structural and functional analogs of sterols

49

. Next to PTC-3, C. elegans encodes

another PTCH protein PTC-1 and 18 PTCH-related proteins (PTRs), presumably all
RND transporters. It is tempting to speculate that these PTCs and PTRs are
transporting small molecules, presumably sterols, and thereby contributing to cellular
homeostasis and potential intra- and intercellular communication.
Our data strongly implicate cellular cholesterol levels, membrane composition
and nuclear hormone receptors such as PPARa and HNF4 in non-canonical Hh
signaling pathways. They also provide a framework on how to distinguish between
SMO-dependent and -independent functions in mammals. Our results might in
particularly important for the understanding of diseases such as multiple myeloma in
which canonical and non-canonical Hh signaling have been implicated 50,51.

Materials and methods
General methods and strains
C. elegans was cultured and maintained as described previously52 at 20°C unless it
was specified different. RNAi was carried out using sequenced and confirmed clones
from the Ahringer library, as mock nontargeting dsRNA from the Ahringer library clone
Y95B8A_84.g was used 53. For low cholesterol conditions cholesterol was omitted and
agar replaced by agarose. RNAi feeding experiments were performed for 3 days
starting from L1 larvae. When adult ptc-3(RNAi) were needed worms were grown with
RNAi mock bacteria until L2 stage and then transferred to ptc-3(RNAi) plates for 2
days. For developmental and survival assays eggs from 1-day adult worms were
hatched in M9 buffer (3 g KH2PO4, 6 g Na2HPO4, 5 g NaCl, 1 ml 1 M MgSO4, H2O to
1 l; sterilized by autoclaving) overnight without bleaching. L1s were transferred to RNAi
plates and grown at 20°C. Survival and developmental stage were assessed after 72
hr. For double RNAi experiments ptc-3(RNAi) was diluted 1:1 with the second RNAi
or mock expressing bacteria. nhr-49(nr2041) [ges-1p::3xHA::nhr-49(cDNA)::unc-54
3'UTR + myo-3p::mCherry::unc-54 3'UTR] and for gut specific RNAi kbIs7 [nhx2p::rde-1 + rol-6(su1006)] was used , sbp-1(ep79)
[sbp-1::GFP::SBP-1; rol-6(su1006)], were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics
Center (CGC). nhr-8(hd117) mutant and nhr-8::GFP over expressing strains were
described previously 39. For the cholesterol sensor strains generation the PFO-derived
D4 domain mutants YDA (D434W Y415A A463W) and YQDA (D434W Y415A A463W

Microscopy
Live worms were immobilized with 50 mM levamisole in M9 and mounted on a slide
with 2% agarose. The worms were imaged with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope
equipped with a Zeiss Axio Cam MRm camera (Carl Zeiss, Aalen Oberkochen,
Germany) and the objectives EC Plan-Neofluar 10x/0.3, EC Plan-Neofluar 20x/0.50,
EC Plan-Neofluar 40/1.30. All images were adjusted to the same parameters with
OMERO.web 5.3.4-ice36-b69. Images of D4H cholesterol sensors, Filipin III staining
and TRAM::GFP were obtained on a Zeiss LSM 880 microscope with Airyscan with
Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC M2. The fast mode was used, and images were
processed using the Zen Black software.
Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy
Worms were mounted on a slide with 2% agarose with 20 mM levamisol. A Leica TCS
SP8 system with a CARS laser picoEmerald. The lasers were beam to 816.4 nm while
keeping the Stokes beam constant at 1,064.6 nm. The scan speed was set to 400 Hz.
A z-stack per worm was imaged along the intestine and 19 animals from 3 experiments
were collected per condition. The number of lipid droplets in each stack was assessed
with the Fiji plug-in Lipid Droplet Counter. The data was analyzed with a one tail
ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test in Prism 7.
TEM and FIB SEM
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and focused-ion beam scanning electron
microscopy (FIB-SEM), worms were frozen as follows. C. elegans animals were

picked with a worm pick from agar plate and transferred to a droplet of M9 medium on
a 100 µm cavity of a 3 mm aluminium specimen carrier (Engineering office M.
Wohlwend GmbH, Sennwald, Switzerland). 5 - 10 worms were added to the droplet
and the excess M9 medium was sucked off with dental filter tips. A flat aluminium
specimen carrier was dipped in 1-hexadecene and added on top. Immediately, the
specimen carrier sandwich was transferred to the middle plate of an HPM 100 highpressure freezer (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria) and frozen immediately
without using ethanol as synchronizing medium.
Freeze-substitution was carried out in water-free acetone containing 1% OsO4
for 8 hr at -90°C, 7 hr at -60°C, 5 hr at -30°C, 1 hr at 0°C, with transition gradients of
30°C/hr, followed by 30 min incubation at RT. Samples were rinsed twice with acetone
water-free, block-stained with 1% uranyl acetate in acetone (stock solution: 20% in
MeOH) for 1 hr at 4°C, rinsed twice with water-free acetone and embedded in
Epon/Araldite (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany): 66% in acetone overnight, 100% for 1 hr
at RT and polymerized at 60°C for 20 hr. Ultrathin sections (50 nm) were post-stained
with Reynolds lead citrate and imaged in a Talos 120 transmission electron
microscope at 120 kV acceleration voltage equipped with a bottom mounted Ceta
camera using the Maps software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Eindhoven, The
Netherlands).
For Focused ion beam scanning electron tomography, a trimmed Epon/Araldite
block containing a single C. elegans was mounted on a regular SEM stub using
conductive carbon and coated with 10 nm of carbon by electron beam evaporation to
render the sample conductive. Ion milling and image acquisition was performed
simultaneously in an Auriga 40 Crossbeam system (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany)
using the FIBICS Nanopatterning engine (Fibics Inc., Ottawa, Canada). A large trench
was milled at a current of 16 nA and 30 kV, followed by fine milling at 240 pA and 30
kV during image acquisition with an advance of 5 nm per image. Prior to starting the
fine milling and imaging, a protective Platinum layer of approximately 300 nm was
applied on top of the surface of the area of interest using the single gas injection
system at the FIB-SEM. SEM images were acquired at 1.9 kV (30 µm aperture) using
an in-lens energy selective backscattered electron detector (ESB) with a grid voltage
of 550 V, and a dwell time of 1 μs and a line averaging of 130 lines. The pixel size was
set to 5 nm and tilt-corrected to obtain isotropic voxels. The final image stack was
registered and cropped to the area of interest using the Fiji image-processing package

[https://imagej.net/TrakEM2]. FIB-SEM images were processed with iLastik57 and
pixel classification was done. The classifier was trained to separate different object
classes, ER, cytoplasm and other organelles. The training was done individually for
each dataset. A 3D reconstruction was later handled with IMARIS 9.2.
Lipidomic analysis
Worms were cultured in liquid media as described previously 58. Feeding bacteria were
prepared by growing RNAi bacteria to an OD600 of 0.6 in LB-Amp medium and then
inducing dsRNA expression with 1 mM IPTG for 24 hr. Bacteria were harvested,
resuspended to OD600 400. Synchronized populations of worms were grown from L1
larvae to L2 stage in mock bacteria and then transferred into RNAi bacteria until they
reach early adulthood. Young adults were collected and washed once in ddH2O. 8,000
young adults were used for glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid analysis while sterol
analysis was done from 40,000 young adults. Pellets were frozen and stored at -80°C
until extraction. Lysis was performed on a Cryolysis machine (Precellys 24, lysis &
homogenization machine (Bertin Technologies)) at 4°C using 100 µl 1.4 mm zirconium
oxide beads in 800 µl MS-H2O with three cycles of 45 sec bursts at 6,200 rpm followed
by 45 sec interruptions. Lysates were eluted into glass tubes with lipid standards
(glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid standards: di-lauryl phosphatidylcholine, dilauryl

phosphatidylethanolamine,

di-lauryl

phosphatidylinositol,

di-lauryl

phosphatidylserine, tetra-lauryl cardiolipin, C17 ceramide, C12 sphingomyelin, C8
glucosylceramide, all from Avanti Polar Lipids; sterol standard: ergosterol from Fluka)
and beads were washed and eluted again with 200 µl MS-H2O. Lipids were extracted
with chloroform and methanol according to Bligh and Dyer
protocol

. Briefly, 3.6 ml organic solvent (CHCl3/MeOH=1:2, v:v) were added to the

1 ml aqueous lysate, mixed and centrifuged to clear extract from worm debris. Extracts
were transferred to new glass tubes and phase separation was induced by addition of
0.5 mL MS-H2O and 0.5 ml CHCl3. Samples were centrifuged, and the organic phase
was collected. For sterol analysis total lipid extract was dried directly in a centrivap.
To separate sterols from other lipids solid phase extraction on a Chromabond® SiOH
column (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) was performed. Columns were washed two
times with 1 ml CHCl3. Total lipid extract from 40,000 worms was resuspended in 250
µl CHCl3 by vortexing and sonication. The extract was then applied to the column and
eluted with two times 650 µl CHCl3. The flow-through and CHCl3 elutions were

combined, dried and used for sterol analysis by GC-MS. In the case of
glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid analysis, total lipid extract was split in two and
dried. One aliquot was used without further treatments for glycerophospholipid
analysis and inorganic phosphate determination while the other underwent
methylamine treatment and desalting via butanol extraction 61.
Glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid analysis was performed following a worm
adapted version of a previously published method 62. LC-MS or HPLC grade solvents
were used and the samples were pipetted in a 96 well plate (final volume = 100 µl).
Positive mode solvent: CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (2:7:1 v/v) + 5mM NH4Ac. Negative mode
solvent: CHCl3/MeOH (1:2 v/v) + 5mM NH4Ac. The glycerophospholipid and
sphingolipid aliquots were resuspended in 250 µl CHCl3/MeOH (1:1 v/v) and sonicated
for 5 min. The glycerophospholipids were diluted 1:10 in negative and positive mode
solvents and the sphingolipids were diluted 1:5 in positive mode solvent and infused
onto the mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry for the identification and
quantification of glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid molecular species was
performed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with a TSQ Vantage Triple Stage
Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany)
equipped with a robotic nanoflow ion source, Nanomate HD (Advion Biosciences,
Ithaca, NY). The collision energy was optimized for each lipid class. Each biological
replicate was read in two technical replicates each comprising three measurements
for each transition. Lipid concentrations were calculated relative to the corresponding
internal standards and then normalized to the total phosphate content of each total
lipid extract. Sterol analysis was done as previously described 61.
Nile Red Staining
Nile Red staining was performed as described previously63. Worms were washed with
1 ml M9 into a 1.5 ml siliconized microfuge tube. Worms were allowed to sink by gravity
on ice and were washed with M9. Approximately 30 µl of M9 and worms at the bottom
of the tube were left. 0.2 ml of 40% isopropanol was added and incubated for 3 min
for fixation. The fixative was removed and 150 µl of Nile Red solution (6 µl of Nile Red
0.5 mg/ml in acetone per 1 ml of 40% isopropanol) was added to the worms for 30 min
at 20°C with gentle rocking in the dark. Worms were washed once with 1 ml M9 buffer
and mounted on a 2% agarose pad for microscopy. Intensity analysis was performed

into the yeast plasmid p426TEF. A point mutation (D697A) was introduced with the
Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (E0554S NEB). Yeasts were cultured to an OD600
of 4, washed with cold water and resuspend to 10 OD600 in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH
7.0. Yeasts were incubated protected from light with 5 µM TopFluor® Cholesterol
(810255, Avanti Polar Lipids) for 2 hr at 20°C. They were washed once with cold
ddH2O and resuspend with HEPES buffer, after 20 min the yeast were spun down,
and the supernatant was measured with filters 485ex 520em on a plate reader
(DTX880, Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter). The efflux was normalized to the
initial fluorescence of the yeast. Worms were washed off a plate with M9 buffer and
put on a shaker in M9 buffer with 5 mM TopFluor® Cholesterol for 1 hr at 20°C. Worms
were washed with M9 buffer once to remove the excess of Topfluor® Cholesterol and
chase in M9 buffer was performed for 1 hr before imaging.
Immunofluorescence and PTC-3 antibody.
Immunofluorescence of C. elegans was performed as described previously

, with

slight modifications: Worms were blocked with PTB (1% BSA, 1x PBS, 0.1 %
Tween20, 0.05 % NaN3,1 mM EDTA) and secondary antibody was diluted in PTB.
Peptide antibodies against C. elegans PTC-3 were generated in rabbits by Eurogentec
using peptides SASHSSDDESSPAHK and EVRRGPELPKENGLG. Serum was used
in a 1:100 dilution and Alexa Fluor 488-goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen; A11034) 1:5,000. Worms were washed 2x in M9 and mounted with fluorescence
protecting media (ProLong™ Glass Antifade Mountant Invitrogen P36984). Worms
were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 microscope as described in the Microscopy section.

Filipin staining
Worms were fixed in Glyoxal solution (2.835 ml ddH2O, 0.789 ml EtOH, 0.313 ml
glyoxal (40% stock solution from Sigma-Aldrich, #128465) 0.03 ml glacial acetic acid.
pH 4.5) for 30 min on ice, and for another 30 min at RT, followed by 30 min of
quenching in 100 mM NH4Cl at RT and O/N post quenching at 4°C

65

. Worms were

washed 2x 30 min with M9 and left in 50 µl of M9 in which 50 µl of Filipin III readymade solution (Sigma-Aldrich, SAE0087) was added for 1 hr in the dark at RT. Worms
were washed 2x in M9 and mounted with fluorescence protecting media (ProLong™
Glass Antifade Mountant Invitrogen P36984). Worms were imaged on a Zeiss LSM
880 microscope as described in the Microscopy section.
Western Blot
Worm Lysate from synchronous L3 worm cultures was prepared in Laemmli buffer
with 6 M urea with glass beads in a FastPrep machine (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA)
for 2x 30 sec. Samples were run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE before transfer onto
nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Protran; 10600003). Membranes were blocked
in TBS containing 5% milk for 1 hr at RT. First antibody incubation was done O/N at
4°C and the secondary HRP-coupled antibodies goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L)
(ThermoFisher scientific; 31430; 1:10,000) or polyclonal HRP-conjugated goat-antirabbit IgG (ThermoFisher scientific; 31460; 1:10,000) for 1 hr at RT. The blots were
developed using WesternBright ECL HRP substrate (K-12045 Advansta) in a Fusion
FX7 (Vilber Lourmat) image acquisition system.
qRT-PCR
RNA for qRT-PCR was extracted with TRIzol according to the manufacturer’s
instructions from synchronous worms 26 hr after L1. The RNA was DNase digested
and reverse transcribed using Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, with
dsDNase (ThermoFischer Scientific). The resulting cDNA was diluted 1:10 for further
analysis. The StepOne RT-PCR system combined with StepOne Software (Applied
Biotechnologies) was used for analysis. The presented values are based on three
biological replicates. Expression levels were normalized to cdc-42 Primer sequences:

Figure 7. Model of how PTC-3 and the loss thereof affects ER structure and LD
formation. PTC-3 controls intracellular cholesterol levels directly by promoting its
efflux. In the absence of PTC-3, cells accumulate cholesterol, which in turn directly
influence membrane properties. In addition, cholesterol directly or indirectly affects
NHRs, which subsequently leads to a reduction of acyl chain length and desaturation.
This second effect enhances the changes in membrane properties and leads to
changes in ER morphology and LD formation.

Immunoblot of lysates of mock or ptc-3 (RNAi) treated worms. (B) PTC-3 gut
localization was confirmed with a GFP-tagged PTC-3. Arrows point to the apical
intestinal membrane. Scale bars 10 µm (C) Mock and ptc-3(RNAi) treated animals
were imaged with CARS microscopy. The signal did not overlap with the
autofluorescence of LROs, validating the proper spectral separation of the filters, and
that we can detect specifically lipid droplets. Scale bars 10 µm.
