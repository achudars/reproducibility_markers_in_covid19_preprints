Cade et al.: WGS analyses of sleep-disordered breathing

Abstract
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder associated with significant morbidity. Through

3

the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program we report the first whole-genome sequence

4

analysis of SDB. We identified 4 rare gene-based associations with SDB traits in 7,988 individuals of diverse

5

ancestry and 4 replicated common variant associations with inclusion of additional samples (n=13,257). We

6

identified a multi-ethnic set-based rare-variant association (p = 3.48 × 10 -8) on chromosome X with ARMCX3.

7

Transcription factor binding site enrichment identified associations with genes implicated with respiratory and

8

craniofacial traits. Results highlighted associations in genes that modulate lung development, inflammation,

9

respiratory rhythmogenesis and HIF1A-mediated hypoxic response.

Cade et al.: WGS analyses of sleep-disordered breathing

Introduction
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a prevalent disorder associated with increased mortality and

12

morbidity [1–4]. The most common type of SDB is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by repeated

13

airway collapse leading to intermittent hypoxemia and sleep disruption, that is increaed in prevalence with older

14

age and male sex [5]. The disease appears to be multifactorial, reflecting variable contributions of abnormalities in

15

ventilatory control, craniofacial anatomy, and adiposity [ 5–11]. Due to an incomplete understanding of its

16

pathophysiology, standard OSA treatment only addresses the downstream manifestations of airway collapse

17

through nightly use of pressurized air to the nasopharynx, a therapy that often is poorly tolerated. Therefore, there

18

is a critical need to identify molecular pathways that could provide specific therapeutic targets. The need for

19

overnight studies to phenotype SDB traits has limited the available sample size for genetic analyses, and only

20

several common-frequency genome-wide analysis studies have been reported [ 11–15]. Increased statistical power

21

may increase the genetic resolution of regions that may not be adequately tagged by current genotyping arrays due

22

to population differences and/or reduced linkage disequilibrium with biologically relevant regions [ 16].

23

The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program is an NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood

24

Institute program designed to improve the understanding of the biological processes that contribute to heart, lung,

25

blood, and sleep disorders [17]. TOPMed has generated whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data on over 100,000

26

individuals from multiple cohorts at >30× depth, including seven studies with objective assessment of SDB. A

27

variant imputation server using TOPMed data also allows for high-quality imputation of non-sequenced genotype

28

chip data [18]. A complementary initiative sponsored by the Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) of

29

the NIH National Human Genome Research Institute has generated sequencing data from additional individuals in

30

two TOPMed cohorts (https://www.genome.gov/27563570). These initiatives provide the ability to examine the

31

genetics of SDB at unprecedented detail in African-Americans (AA), Asian-Americans (AsA), European-

32

Americans/Australians (EA), and Hispanic/Latino-Americans (HA).

33

In this first WGS analysis of SDB, we examine the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the standard clinic

34

metric of SDB, and four complementary measurements of overnight hypoxemia: average and minimum

35

oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) during sleep and the percent of the sleep recording with SpO 2 < 90% (Per90);

36

and the average desaturation per hypopnea event. These indices were chosen because of clinical relevance, high

37

heritability, or prior significant GWAS findings [7–9,11,14]. We examined 7,988 individuals with objectively

38

measured SDB and WGS data in conjunction with data from 13,257 individuals with imputed genotype data.

Methods

40

Each study had a protocol approved by its respective Institutional Review Board and participants

41

provided informed consent. A study overview is provided in Supplementary Figure 1. There were two classes of

42

data: “WGS studies” had WGS performed by the TOPMed program and, in some cases, in additional participants

43

by the CCDG program (referred to as “WGS” studies); “Imputed studies” had array-based genotyping later

44

imputed using the TOPMed imputation server (as described below). Some studies with WGS contributed imputed

45

study data from additional array-based genotyped individuals.

46
47

WGS studies

48

The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), and the

49

Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (FHS) included individuals who participated in the Sleep Heart Health

50

Study (SHHS), who underwent polysomnography (PSG) between 1995 – 1998 using the Compumedics PS-2

51

system [19–22]. These samples included 1,028 EAs from ARIC; 151 AAs and 557 EAs from CHS; and 478 EAs

52

from FHS.

53

The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is investigating the risk factors for clinical

54

cardiovascular disease [23]. PSG was obtained between 2010 – 2013 using the Compumedics Somte system [ 24].

55

This analysis includes data from 698 EAs, 486 AAs, 456 HAs, and 229 AsAs.

56

The Cleveland Family Study (CFS) was designed to investigate the familial basis of SDB, with four visits

57

occurring from 1990 – 2006 [25]. Sleep was assessed either in a clinical research center using full PSG

58

(Compumedics E series) (visit 4); or in the latest available prior examination using an in-home sleep apnea testing

59

device (Edentrace). Data were analyzed from 505 AAs and 485 EAs (339 AAs and 234 EAs with full PSG data).

60

The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) is studying multiple health

61

conditions in HAs [26,27]. Home sleep apnea testing was performed during the baseline examination (2008 – 2011)

62

using the ARES Unicorder 5.2, a validated device including a forehead-based reflectance oximeter, a nasal

63

pressure cannula and pressure transducer, an accelerometer, and a microphone [ 28]. 2,339 individuals provided

64

data.

65

The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is investigating cardiovascular disease in AAs [ 29]. An in-home sleep

66

study was performed from 2012 – 2016 using a validated Type 3 sleep apnea testing device (Embla Embletta

67

Gold) [30,31]. 575 individuals contributed data.

The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS) is a multi-center cohort study initially designed to

71

examine the risk factors for osteoporosis, fractures, and prostate cancer in older males [ 32,33]. An ancillary study

72

(MrOS Sleep; 2003 – 2005) focused on outcomes of sleep disturbances used PSG and nearly identical procedures

73

as in MESA (Compumedics Safiro system) [34]. 2,181 EA individuals were included, with genotyping performed

74

using the Illumina Human Omni 1 Quad v1-0 H array.

75

The Starr County Health Studies (Starr) investigates the risk factors for diabetes in Mexican-Americans

76

[

77

finger pulse oximetry, actigraphy, body position, and peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar-Medical WatchPAT-

78

200) [37]. 782 HA individuals were studied, using Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping data.

79

35,36

]. An in-home sleep apnea study occurred between 2010 and 2014 using a validated instrument that records

The Western Australian Sleep Health Study (WASHS) is a clinic-based study focused on the

80

epidemiology and genetics of SDB [38]. PSG was obtained from 1,508 European-ancestry patients (91% referred

81

for SDB evaluation) from 2006 – 2010 (Compumedics Series E). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina

82

Omni 2.5 array.

83

Imputed genotype data were available for additional members of the TOPMed cohorts described above.

84

Study/population combinations with fewer than 100 individuals were excluded. ARIC contributed an additional

85

631 EA individuals (Affymetrix 6.0; dbGaP phg000035.v1.p1). CFS contributed 225 AA and 218 EA individuals

86

(Affymetrix 6.0; Illumina OmniExpress+Exome, Exome, and IBC). CHS contributed 365 individuals (Illumina

87

CNV370 and IBC; phg000135.v1.p1 and phg000077.v1.p1). FHS contributed 192 EA individuals (Affymetrix

88

500k; phg000006.v7). HCHS/SOL contributed 7,155 HA individuals (Illumina Omni 2.5; phg000663.v1).

91

Phenotype and covariate definitions
We examined several SDB measures, including specific measures of OSA: AHI (number of apneas plus

92

hypopneas per hour of sleep, with a minimum 3% desaturation per event) and average oxyhemoglobin

93

desaturation per apnea or hypopnea; and measures of SDB severity [ 7–9]: average and minimum SpO2 and the

94

percentage of the night with SpO2 < 90% (Per90). Apart from WASHS, all sleep data were scored by blinded

95

scorers at one central Sleep Reading Center with high levels of scorer reliability using well-defined procedures

96

[39,40]. We adjusted for age, age2, sex, age × sex, body mass index (BMI), and BMI2 due to known age and sex

97

effects, some of which are non-linearly associated with outcomes, and our goal of identifying obesity-independent

98

loci. Age and BMI were obtained at the time of the sleep recording. Phenotype analyses were pooled within

99

populations to aggregate very rare variants for testing, and therefore further adjusted for study. Cryptic relatedness

100

and population substructure were controlled for using linear mixed models. Genomic control was applied to

101

population-specific results (or cohort-specific imputed genotype results).

103

WGS and genotyping

104

Sequence data were derived from the TOPMed Freeze 6a release, jointly called by the TOPMed

105

Informatics Research Center at the University of Michigan (http://github.com/statgen/topmed_variant_calling).

106

The methodology was described elsewhere [ 17]. In brief, WGS was performed at the Broad Institute (ARIC, FHS,

107

MESA), Baylor College of Medicine (ARIC, CHS, HCHS/SOL), and the University of Washington (CFS, JHS).

108

Additional ARIC and HCHS/SOL WGS funded by CCDG and performed at Baylor College of Medicine were

109

included in the jointly-called data. TOPMed and CCDG calling pipelines have functionally equivalent outcomes

110

despite data processing differences (as detailed in [ 41]). WGS data were merged and normalized; inferred sequence

111

contamination was identified; and SNPs and small indels were detected (structural variants are not currently

112

available). Lower quality variants were excluded using Mendelian consistency checks. Variants were aligned to

113

Build 38 and annotated using snpEff 4.3t [42]. We excluded variants with <10× depth or >5% missingness, leaving

114

152.7 million polymorphic variants in 7,988 individuals with SDB phenotypes.

115

Genotype data were imputed using the TOPMed Imputation Server [ 18] using a Freeze 5b (Build 38)

116

template. Forward strand checks were performed using the Strand database and the Haplotype Reference

117

Consortium imputation preparation script (https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/tools/) and confirmed using

118

Ensembl variant allele checks and internal QC performed on the server. Study-level data were imputed separately.

119

Analyses on variants with r2 score > 0.5 were therefore performed separately for each study.

120

Statistical analyses

121

Single and grouped variant analyses were performed using EMMAX and MMSKAT, both within the

122

EPACTS suite (v3.3, https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/EPACTS) [43]. WGS genetic relatedness matrices

123

(GRM) were constructed using autosomal variants (MAF > 0.1%) following a comparison of EPACTS point-wise

124

heritability estimates of the AHI using different minimal MAFs. A grid search identified optimal GRM

125

parameters with imputed data (MAF > 0.5%, r2 > 0.90) using 929 ARIC individuals with imputation and WGS

126

data. Log10 P-values using identical association test parameters had a Spearman’s ρ correlation of 0.951 between

127

WGS and imputed data. Matrices were constructed separately for each study + population combination (due to

128

potentially differential imputation coverage).

129

Gene-based group sets were constructed with a series of filters considering non-pseudogenes expressed in

130

any GTEx v7 tissue. A variant could be assigned to one or more Ensembl genes based on SNPEff annotations

131

[42,44]. We examined 5_prime_UTR_premature_start_codon_gain_variant, bidirectional_gene_fusion,

132

conservative_inframe_deletion, conservative_inframe_insertion, disruptive_inframe_deletion,

133

disruptive_inframe_insertion, exon_loss_variant, frameshift_variant, gene_fusion, intiator_codon_variant,

134

missense_variant, non_canonical_start_codon, splice_acceptor_variant, splice_donor_variant,

135

splice_region_variant, start_loss, stop_gained, stop_lost, and stop_retained_variant mutations. We also included

136

variants located within experimentally derived promoter regions and Ensembl-derived Tarbase miRNA binding

137

sites; and regulatory variants located within 1000 bases of a particular gene, including ChIP-seq determined

138

transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), and Ensembl-derived CTCF, TFBS, and promoter sites [ 44–46]. Group set

139

variants were filtered by requiring either a FATHMM-XF score > 0.5 or a CDTS < 1% constrained region score

140

[47,48]. Exonic variants could alternatively have a PrimateAI score > 0.803 or a Havrilla et al. < 1% constrained

141

coding region score [49,50].

142

Gene-based tests considered variants in WGS-only data (MAF < 5%). Pooled (across cohort) analyses

143

were performed within each population in order to aggregate information on very rare variants across studies.

144

Combined population results were obtained through meta-analysis of p-values weighted by sample size (due to

145

potentially different MAF spectra driven by population demography). A significance level of p < 4.51 × 10 -8 was

146

used, reflecting a Bonferroni adjustment for all genes tested across all phenotype and population configurations.

147

A second set-based analysis was designed to query for TFBS annotation enrichment [ 51]. We performed

148

250 base-pair sliding window analyses (to improve power by aggregating additional variants beyond an

149

approximate ChIP-seq peak width of 100 base-pairs). We filtered for variants with either a FATHMM-XF score >

150

0.5 or a CDTS 1% score with no MAF cut-offs and meta-analyzed MMSKAT results across the 4 populations,

151

noting windows with p-values < 0.01. These intervals were tested for enrichment of ChIP-seq coordinates with at

152

least 50% physical overlap for up to 437 transcription factors using ReMap 2018 v1.2

153

(http://tagc.univ-mrs.fr/remap/index.php?page=annotation) [ 52].

154

Single-variant EMMAX tests examined common variants (MAF > 0.5%). Meta-analysis across

155

populations (and imputed genotype studies) used METAL with genomic control [ 53]. We performed bidirectional

156

discovery and replication using the WGS and imputed samples (noting the high genomic resolution in the WGS

157

samples and the higher sample size in the imputed data). We report results including at least 1000 individuals,

158

discovery association p-values < 1 × 10-5 and replication association p-values < 0.05. Significance was defined as

159

p < 1 × 10-8 in joint analyses, reflecting adjustment for five correlated phenotypes (Supplementary Table S3). We

160

performed MetaXcan imputed GTEx gene expression analyses using joint EA results in selected tissues relevant

161

to SDB and GIGSEA pathway analyses of MetaXcan output in whole blood (to maximize power), with empirical

162

p-values incorporating 10,000 permutations [54,55].

Results

165

Study sample

166

A study overview is provided in Supplementary Figure 1. Tables 1 and 2 provide a summary of the

167

study samples and SDB traits analyzed using WGS and imputed genotypes, respectively. In total, there were

168

21,244 individuals (1,942 AAs; 229 AsAs; 8,341 EAs; and 10,732 HAs). Median AHI levels ranged from mildly

169

to moderately elevated, reflecting the age range and sex distribution of each cohort. Pairwise correlations of

170

phenotypes and covariates are provided in Supplementary Table 3.

171
172

Gene-based results

173

Gene-based rare variant results are presented in Table 3 (for meta-analyzed results across multiple

174

populations) and in Table 4 (for secondary population-specific results). Collectively, we identified 4 significantly

175

associated genes (Bonferroni p < 4.51 × 10-8). ARMCX3, identified in the multiple-population analysis, is an X-

176

linked protein-coding that was associated with average desaturation (p = 5.29 × 10 -8). Two protein-coding genes

177

were identified in population-specific analyses of Per90: MRPS33 (p = 1.22 × 10-9) and C16orf90 (p = 1.36 × 10-

178

8

179

significant results (p < 0.01) and additional details are presented in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.

). We identified 12 suggestively associated genes (p ≤ 4.22 × 10-7). Three genes are druggable [56,57]. Nominally

180
181
182

Single-variant results
We identified four genome-level significant loci in single-variant analyses (MAF > 0.5%; p < 1.0 × 10-8;

183

Table 5). In multiple-population analyses, the 2q12 locus (rs77375846; IL18RAP) was associated with average

184

event desaturation in a multiple-population analysis (combined p = 1.57 × 10 -9) and minimum SpO2 (consistent

185

with a previous report [14]). Two novel population-specific loci were identified. The 8p12 locus (rs35447033,

186

NRG1) was associated with AHI in EAs (combined p = 3.02 × 10-9, Figure 1). The 5p13 locus (rs28777;

187

SLC45A2) was associated with average SpO2 in EAs (combined p = 8.08 × 10-10, Figure 2). In HAs, the 1q32

188

locus (rs116133558; ATP2B4) was associated with Per90 (combined p = 3.51 × 10-10) and with average SpO2 (as

Cade et al.: WGS analyses of sleep-disordered breathing

We used joint WGS and imputed EA results to impute associations with gene expression levels using a

196

MetaXcan framework for 6 tissues (subcutaneous and visceral omentum adipose, lung, monocytes, skeletal

197

muscle, and whole blood). No individual tests reached Bonferroni significance (p < 2.60 × 10-7; Supplementary

198

Table 7). Genes that were observed in the top 10 results across the varied analyses (Supplementary Table 8)

199

included ZNF83 (15 instances) and CHRNE (13 instances).

200

Whole blood MetaXcan results (with the largest sample size) were further evaluated in GIGSEA-based

201

pathway analyses. KEGG pathway results are shown in Supplementary Table 9. The most significantly

202

associated pathway was KEGG_STEROID_HORMONE_BIOSYNTHESIS (average SpO 2 empirical p-value =

203

7.00 × 10-4). KEGG_RIG_I_LIKE_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING_PATHWAY was observed in the top 10 results

204

for 4 of the 5 phenotypes. Gene-centric transcription factor binding site (TFBS) enrichment analysis results are

205

presented in Supplementary Table 10. V$PEA3_Q6 (ETV4) was the most significantly associated TFBS

206

(average desaturation empirical p-value = 3.00 × 10-4) and was the strongest association for AHI and minimum

207

SpO2 (empirical p-values 0.002 and 0.001, respectively). The most significant miRNA binding site enrichment

208

analysis association was GCATTTG,MIR-105 (average SpO 2 p = 0.002; Supplementary Table 11).

209

AGGCACT,MIR-515-3P (the strongest AHI association, p = 0.009) was observed in the top ten results for four

210

phenotypes.

211
212
213

ChIP-seq transcription factor binding site interval enrichment
We performed a sliding window analysis to examine enriched intervals containing ChIP-seq derived

214

coordinates for up to 437 transcription factors (Table 6, Supplementary Table 12). FOXP2 TFBS were

215

consistently the most enriched for all phenotypes. Other notable transcription factors in the top 5 included EGR1,

216

KDM4B, KDM6B, and TP63. KDM4B and KDM6B are druggable [56,57]. Leading sliding window results are

217

provided in Supplementary Table 13.

Cade et al.: WGS analyses of sleep-disordered breathing

Discussion
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with increased risk of a wide range of disorders, including

221

atrial fibrillation, cancer, cognitive impairment, diabetes, liver, and interstitial lung diseases, as well as premature

222

mortality [3,4,62–67]. Treatment options, however, are limited by a lack of knowledge of molecular pathways,

223

including those that may be “druggable”. Recent analyses of SDB traits have focused on common variants and

224

identified several preliminary genome-level significant associations using GWAS, admixture mapping, and

225

linkage approaches [11–15], but did not address gene-based or rare variant effects. Ten studies and over 21,000

226

individuals of multiple ancestries with WGS data at unprecedented resolution from the NHLBI TOPMed program

227

combined with densely imputed data from other sources contributed to these results. We identified several variant,

228

gene-based, and pathway-level associations. Analyses adjusted for obesity, a major SDB risk factor, identified

229

loci and genes implicated in pulmonary, inflammatory, and craniofacial pathways. Some associations were

230

population-specific, while others were sex-specific, consistent with population differences and strong sex

231

differences for SDB [24,68–70]. Notably, across multiple ancestral groups, we identified a set-based rare-variant

232

association (p = 3.48 × 10-8) on chromosome X with ARMCX3.

233
234
235

Gene-based results
Across multiple populations, ARMCX3 (ALEX3) and the RNA anti-sense gene ARMCX3-AS1 were

236

associated with apnea-hypopnea triggered intermittent hypoxia. ARMCX3 regulates mitochondrial aggregation

237

and trafficking in multiple tissues and facilitates neuronal survival and axon regeneration [ 71–73]. Wnt signaling

238

regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and ARMCX3-associated mitochondrial aggregation [72,74].

239

Potential mechanisms for further study include sensitized carotid body chemoreflexes, interaction with

240

inflammatory mechanisms, and neuronal dysfunction within respiratory centers. Sleep apnea and reduced

241

ventilatory drive are enriched in individuals with a primary mitochondrial disorder [ 75]. Mitochondria are an

242

important source of ROS, which modulate the acute hypoxic ventilatory response. Mitochondria impact HIF1A

243

signaling and may contribute to oxygen sensing [76–79]. ROS are required for intermittent hypoxia-induced

244

respiratory long-term facilitation [80,81]. These effects may mitigate the level of hypoxia resulting from recurrent

245

apneas, or conversely, lead to ventilatory instability, promoting apnea occurrence. Mitochondrial ROS also

246

activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in multiple pulmonary diseases, consistent with an inflammation model that

247

includes our IL18-pathway and HK1 results, ROS-related proinflammatory responses to lung capillary pressure,

248

and evidence of alveolar epithelial injury/SDB interactions [ 14,82–87]. Our findings suggest value in investigating the

249

mechanisms by which ARMCX3 predisposes to SDB, and whether these associations are mediated by neuronal

250

dysfunction and/or ROS and carotid body sensitization, and interact with the inflammasome.

251

Additional genes were significantly associated in population-specific analyses, including the

252

mitochondrial ribosomal gene MRPS33. Mitoribosomes are responsible for expression of the 13 essential

253

components of the oxidative phosphorylation system, and a majority of the small subunit proteins have been

254

implicated in disease [88]. The expression of several small and large subunit proteins are altered in a hypoxic

255

environment [89]. MRPS33 expression varies with oxygen treatment in COPD [90].

256
257
258

Single-variant results
We identified four common frequency associated loci, including multiple-population associations with

259

the IL18RAP region. The IL18RAP region has been associated with minimum SpO2 [14], and here we further

260

identify an association with average event desaturation, highlighting a role in an OSA-specific trait. Multiple

261

variants in this region are also GTEx eQTL variants for both interleukin-18 receptor subunits IL18RAP and

262

IL18R1 (Supplementary Table 6) and experimental studies support a role for IL18 signaling in mediating this

263

association, possibly through effects of pulmonary inflammation on gas exchange (reviewed in [14]).

264

We identified three population-specific loci, including two novel associations in individuals of European

265

ancestry (Figures 1 and 2). 65 variants in the NRG1 region were associated with the AHI (p < 1.0 × 10-8,

266

Supplementary Table 6). This region was suggestively associated with sleep apnea in a Korean population [ 91],

267

however the lead signals appear to be independent (rs10097555 Korean p = 2.6 × 10 -6, EA p = 0.91). NRG1 is

268

associated with lung development and acute lung injury, and mediates inflammasome-induced alveolar cell

269

permeability [87,92–95]. NRG1 promotes accumulation of HIF1A and has increased expression in vascular smooth

270

muscle cells following exposure to intermittent hypoxia [ 96,97]. The lead SLC45A2 region variant rs28777 (average

271

SpO2 p = 8.08 × 10-10) has been associated with multiple traits and is in a splicing regulatory element with extreme

272

population differentiation [98]. An association in the ATP2B4 region with average SpO2 in HAs [11] has been

273

extended to a second hypoxemia trait at the same variant (Per90 p = 3.31 × 10 -10). This gene is the main cellular

274

membrane calcium pump in erythrocytes and also regulates vascular tone [ 99,100].

275
276
277

Pathway analyses
Several gene pathways were identified in EA individuals using imputed gene expression in whole blood

278

(Supplementary Table 9). KEGG_RIG_I_LIKE_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING_PATHWAY (retinoic acid-inducible

279

gene I-like) was the most commonly observed, occurring in the top 10 results for 4 of the 5 phenotypes. This

280

pathway initiates the immune response to RNA virus infection [ 101], consistent with a role for inflammation at the

281

NRG1 and IL18RAP loci. Steroid hormone biosynthesis (the most significantly associated pathway), PPAR

282

signaling, and metabolism (via ‘starch and sucrose metabolism’) suggest the importance of biological pathways

283

modulating energy homeostasis and balance and metabolic function [ 102]. In the gene-centric GIGSEA TFBS

284

analysis, V$PEA3_Q6 (ETV4) was the lead association for three phenotypes. ETV4 influences branching in the

285

developing lung and regulates hypoxia-inducible factor signaling [ 103,104], a major mechanism influencing

286

ventilatory control.

287
288
289

Transcription factor binding site enrichment
Several transcription factors were identified through interval enrichment of observed TFBS across the

290

genome (Table 6). FOXP2 was consistently the most enriched transcription factor and is known to regulate gene

291

expression in epithelial lung tissue and response to lung injury through an inflammatory mechanism [ 105,106].

292

FOXP2 is also expressed in brainstem respiratory areas including the pre-Bötzinger complex (which is essential

293

for respiratory rhythmogenesis) and impacts airway morphology [ 107,108]. Two lysine demethylases (KDM4B and

294

KDM6B) were also identified. KDM6B (JMJD3) is required for a functional pre-Bötzinger complex [109,110] and

295

reduced KDM6B protein expression was reported in hypoxic OSA patients [111]. Kdm6b also plays roles in

296

immune function and lung development [112–114]. Drosophila Kdm4b knock-outs have increased sleep [115].

297

KDM4B (JMJD2B) and KDM6B are both members of the JmjC protein domain family and are regulated by

298

HIF1A, require oxygen as a cofactor and act as oxygen sensors for chromatin in hypoxia [ 116,117]. EGR1 mediates

299

hypoxia-induced pulmonary fibrosis [118]. TP63 is associated with cleft palate in Tp63 deficient mice, which is

300

associated with an increased prevalence of OSA [ 119,120], suggesting that its relationship to OSA may be through

301

pathways influencing craniofacial development. Among the leading 250-base pair sliding window results

302

(Supplementary Table 13), 4:105708751-105709001 (Per90 HA p = 2.72 × 10-9) is of note due to regional

303

associations with lung function and expression in human lung [ 121].

304
305
306

Strengths and weaknesses
This study is the first genome-wide analysis of objectively measured SDB traits using deep sequencing.

307

Together with improved imputation quality, the TOPMed resource has enabled unprecedented genetic resolution.

308

We examined clinically relevant phenotypes measured using rigorous methodology [ 5,7–10]. We analyzed data from

309

10 studies of individuals from four population groups that used different ascertainment strategies, which may

310

potentially improve the generalization of our results. While this analysis is among the largest performed for SDB

311

traits to date, our moderate sample size has lower power to detect weaker associations, and data were not

312

available to replicate these first rare variant associations. While there are multiple lines of evidence in the

313

literature to support our findings, additional experimental followup analyses are required.

Cade et al.: WGS analyses of sleep-disordered breathing

We have identified the first rare-variant and additional common-variant associations at genome-level

317

significance with objectively measured SDB traits in humans. The results point to biologically relevant pathways

318

for further study, including a novel X-linked association (ARCMX3), and a number of associations in genes that

319

modulate lung development, inflammation, respiratory rhythmogenesis and HIF1A-mediated hypoxic-response

320

pathways. These associations will motivate future sample collection and follow-up in cell-line and animal

321

validation studies, with potential therapeutic benefit for sleep-disordered breathing and related comorbidities.

Lead EMMAX single-variant associations within one order of magnitude of significance (combined p < 1.00 × 10-8) and with replication evidence
(p < 0.05) are shown. Full results for all variants in each locus with p < 1.00 × 10-7, including additional associations with secondary models, and
metadata and annotations, are provided in Supplementary Table 6.

250 base-pair sliding window coordinates with association p < 0.01 were queried for interval enrichment of ChIP-seq derived transcription factor
binding sites using the ReMap annotation tool. ChIP-seq coordinates were required to have >50% overlap with a sliding window interval. ReMapderived expected overlaps are obtained from the equivalent number of similarly-sized random regions. E-value indicates the expected value, with a
higher log-transformed value indicating greater enrichment. Full results are provided in Supplementary Table 12.
