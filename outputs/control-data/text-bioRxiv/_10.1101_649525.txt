Abstract

29

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), a mosquito-borne RNA virus, is one of the

30

most acutely virulent viruses endemic to the Americas, causing between 30% and 70%

31

mortality in symptomatic human cases. A major factor in the virulence of EEEV is the

32

presence of four binding sites for the hematopoietic cell-specific microRNA, miR-142-

33

3p, in the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) of the virus. Three of the sites are “canonical”

34

with all 8 seed sequence residues complimentary to miR-142-3p while one is “non-

35

canonical” and has a seed sequence mismatch. Interaction of the EEEV genome with

36

miR-142-3p limits virus replication in myeloid cells and suppresses the systemic innate

37

immune response, greatly exacerbating EEEV neurovirulence. The presence of the

38

miRNA binding sequences is also required for efficient EEEV replication in mosquitoes

39

and, therefore, essential for transmission of the virus. In the current studies, we have

40

examined the role of each binding site by point mutagenesis of seed sequences in all

41

combinations of sites followed by infection of mammalian myeloid cells, mosquito cells

42

and mice. The resulting data indicate that both canonical and non-canonical sites

43

contribute to cell infection and animal virulence, however, surprisingly, all sites are

44

rapidly deleted from EEEV genomes shortly after infection of myeloid cells or mice.

45

Finally, we show that the virulence of a related encephalitis virus, western equine

46

encephalitis virus, is also dependent upon miR-142-3p binding sites.

Author Summary

49

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is one of the most acutely virulent mosquito-

50

borne viruses in the Americas. A major determinant of EEEV virulence is a mammalian

51

microRNA (miRNA) that is primarily expressed in myeloid cells, miR-142-3p. Like

52

miRNA suppression of host mRNA, miR-142-3p binds to the 3’ untranslated region

53

(UTR) of the EEEV genome only in myeloid cells suppressing virus replication and the

54

induction of the innate immune response. In this study, we used point mutations in all

55

four miR-142-3p binding sites in the EEEV 3’ UTR to understand the mechanism behind

56

this miRNA suppression. We observed that decreasing the number of miR-142-3p

57

binding sites leads to virus escape and ultimately attenuation in vivo. Furthermore,

58

another virus, western equine encephalitis virus, also encodes miR-142-3p binding sites

59

that contribute to virulence in vivo. These results provide insight into the mechanism of

60

how cell-specific miRNAs can mediate suppression of virus replication.

Introduction

63

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that

64

causes severe manifestations of encephalitis in humans resulting in high mortality rates

65

and long-term neurological sequelae in symptomatic cases [1] and is one of, if not the

66

most acutely virulent virus circulating in North America. Even though both EEEV and

67

the closely related Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) cause encephalitic

68

disease, they exhibit drastic differences in their pathogenesis, in large part due to

69

differential infectivity of the viruses for myeloid cells. VEEV is highly myeloid cell tropic

70

and induces a robust innate immune response while EEEV is largely replication

71

defective in these cells, which limits the production of systemic IFN-a/b and other innate

72

cytokines in vivo [2]. Critical to EEEV virulence, a host microRNA (miRNA), miR-142-3p,

73

primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells [3], prevents translation of the EEEV genome

74

and virus replication in myeloid cells by interaction with binding sites in the EEEV 3’

75

untranslated region (UTR) [4]. Remarkably, although mosquitoes do not express miR-

76

142-3p, presence of the miR-142-3p binding site sequences is required for efficient

77

mosquito infection and, presumably, transmission of EEEV in nature [4].

78

miRNAs are short ~22 nucleotide long non-coding RNAs that can be transcribed

79

from both coding and non-coding chromosomal regions. miRNAs bind to complimentary

80

sequences in host mRNA as part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) through

81

the seed sequence, nucleotides 2-8 at the 5’ end of the miRNA [5]. Perfect

82

complementarity throughout the entire miRNA and target mRNA can lead to

83

degradation of the mRNA, but is rarely seen in mammalian interactions [6,7]. More

84

commonplace in mammalian cells is a perfect match (canonical sequence) or a single

85

mis-match (non-canonical sequence) in the seed sequence and the target mRNA [8,9]

86

leading to translational repression, downregulation of protein expression, and RNA

87

destabilization [10,11]. The miR-142-3p blockade virtually eliminates EEEV translation

88

and replication in myeloid cells [4].

89

miRNAs can interact with the 5’ UTR (e.g. hepatitis C virus (HCV) [12]), 3’ UTR

90

(e.g. EEEV [4], and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) [13]) or coding regions (e.g.

91

influenza [14-16], and enterovirus-71 [17,18]) (reviewed in [19]). This interaction leads

92

to either inhibition of virus translation and replication (e.g. EEEV [4]) or stabilization of

93

the virus RNA and increased replication (e.g. HCV [20] and BVDV [13]). There are

94

three canonical and one non-canonical miR-142-3p sites in a 260 nt stretch of the EEEV

95

3’ UTR [4]; however, the contribution of each site to replication inhibition is not known,

96

and the contribution of individual or combinations of miRNA binding sites to virulence in

97

animals is not known for any virus.

98

In the current studies, we have leveraged the highly restrictive effect of miR-142-

99

3p on EEEV replication in vitro and in vivo to examine the impact of each of the four

100

sites present in the 3’ UTR on virus replication and disease. We have used point

101

mutations to alter each of the miRNA binding sites to a non-functional sequence, either

102

individually or in combination. We then examined infection efficiency for myeloid cells or

103

mouse lymphoid tissue, replication, innate immune response induction, disease severity

104

after mouse infection and competence for mosquito cell replication. We found that both

105

canonical and non-canonical sites contributed to the virulence phenotype of wild type

106

(WT) EEEV with a single site exerting the most potent effect upon virulence. The

107

contribution of all sites to restriction of myeloid cell replication was reinforced by the

108

observation that deletion mutations in the 3’ UTR arose rapidly during WT EEEV

109

replication in vitro and in mice removing all of the miR-142-3p sites and conferring

110

myeloid cell tropism to EEEV. Finally, we provide evidence that another encephalitic

111

alphavirus, western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) also possesses functional miR-

112

142-3p binding sites in its 3’ UTR.

RESULTS

114

miR-142-3p binds to the EEEV 3’ UTR within the RISC complex in RAW cells

115

The RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) facilitates repression of host mRNA

116

and viral RNAs through interactions of Argonaute protein (Ago) with host miRNAs

117

[20,21]. In an effort to determine if miR-142-3p bound to viral RNA and targeted it to the

118

RISC complex, we utilized a translation reporter that encodes the 5’ UTR and the WT

119

EEEV 3’ UTR encoding the four miR-142-3p binding sites (Figure 1A) or the 11337

120

deletion mutant 3’ UTR that lacks all of the miR-142-3p binding sites [4] and two

121

different experimental methodologies: 1) immunoprecipitation of the Ago protein to

122

isolate RNAs interacting with the complex and 2) precipitation of biotin-labeled miR-142-

123

3p to ascertain whether miR-142-3p interacted directly with the EEEV 3’ UTR in myeloid

124

cells. Virus-specific RT-PCR of precipitated nucleic acids was then used to quantify the

125

level of reporter RNA.

126

After electroporation of the EEEV translation reporters into RAW 264.7

127

monocyte/macrophage cell line, which constitutively expresses miR-142-3p[4], WT

128

EEEV RNA was ~15 fold higher in the Ago-immunoprecipitated fraction compared to

129

11337 reporter RNA when normalized to mock electroporated cells and total input RNA

130

(Figure 1B) demonstrating that WT EEEV interacted with the Ago complex. Next, to

131

determine specifically if miR-142-3p bound to the EEEV 3’ UTR, we electroporated a

132

biotin-labeled miR-142-3p or biotin-labeled scrambled control miRNA into RAW cells

133

along with the EEEV reporters and immunoprecipitated RNA complexes with

134

streptavidin beads. We detected ~18 fold higher levels of WT EEEV RNA in lysates that

135

were

136

electroporation with a scrambled miRNA mimic (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we detected

137

only very low levels of 11337 reporter RNA in lysates after co-transfection with both the

138

biotin-miR-142-3p mimic or scrambled mimic demonstrating the specificity of miR-142-

139

3p interaction with the WT EEEV 3’ UTR. PCR analysis indicated that the initial levels of

140

WT and 11337 reporter RNA in electroporated RAW cells were comparable prior to

141

immunoprecipitation. Thus, the EEEV 3’ UTR interacts with miR-142-3p inside RISC

142

complex through the Ago proteins presumably leading to translational inhibition of the

143

EEEV genome.

144
145

Combinatorial mutation of the EEEV miR-142-3p binding sites increases virus

146

replication in myeloid cells

147

A higher number of miRNA binding sites within a virus 3’ UTR may lead to

148

increased suppression of tissue-specific virus replication and virus attenuation in vivo

149

[22,23]. To determine the contribution of each miR14-2-4p binding site to restriction of

150

EEEV replication, we created point mutant EEEV viruses in every combination of one,

151

two, three or all four miR-142-3p binding sites disrupted in the 3’ UTR (Figure 1D) in the

152

background of a nLuc expressing virus [24]. We incorporated mutations at 3 nucleotides

153

at positions 2 (C2G), 4 (T4C), and 6 (A6T) in each of the canonical miR-142-3p binding

154

sites that is complimentary to the miR-142-3p seed sequence (Figure 1D, sites 1, 3 and

155

4). We also made similar mutations in the non-canonical miR-142-3p binding site (site

156

2), except at position 2 where an A-G mutation was inserted making all four binding

157

sites have the same 3 nucleotide mutations. This yielded fifteen mutant viruses with the

158

combined four-site mutant containing a total of 12 point mutations over a span of ~250

159

nucleotides.

160

In BHK-21 fibroblast cells, which do not express miR-142-3p [4], point mutation

161

of the miR-142-3p binding sites did not significantly change virus replication compared

162

to WT EEEV or the 11337 deletion mutant at 12 hpi (Figure 2A) or subsequent time

163

points (data not shown). In RAW cells, a monocyte/macrophage cell line which express

164

an intermediate level of miR-142-3p, and C57BL/6 bone marrow-derived dendritic cells

165

(BMDCs), which express a high level of miR-142-3p [4], mutation of each miR-142-3p

166

binding site individually, leaving three intact miR-142-3p binding sites, did not

167

significantly increase virus replication compared to WT EEEV (Figure 2B-C). Mutation of

168

any two of the miR-142-3p binding sites resulted in a reproducible but small increase in

169

virus replication in both RAW and BMDCs that did not attain statistical significance

170

versus WT EEEV. However, mutation of 3 miR-142-3p binding sites, leaving only a

171

single binding site intact, led to significantly higher levels of virus replication at 12 hpi in

172

both RAW and BMDC cells (Figure 2B-C), with the exception of the virus with mutations

173

in sites 1, 2, and 3 leaving site 4 intact in RAW cells.

174

Both the 11337 deletion mutant and the 1234 point mutant are impaired in their

175

ability to replicate in in vitro in C6/36 mosquito cells and in mosquito vectors [4],

176

suggesting a requirement for these 3’UTR sequences in the EEEV transmission cycle.

177

Therefore, we used the point mutant viruses to determine whether or not the individual

178

miR-142-3p binding sites contribute to EEEV replication in mosquito cells. At 8 hpi,

179

replication of both the quadruple mutant 1234 and 11337 mutant viruses were

180

significantly reduced in C6/36 cells compared to EEEV WT (Figure 2D). Of the three

181

mutation viruses, only mutants 134 and 234 were significantly reduced compared to

182

EEEV WT, while there was no difference in replication of the other EEEV mutants. By

183

12hpi, only mutants 1234 and 11337 were significantly reduced compared to WT

184

(Figure 2E). Combined with the fact that the 11337 mutant was significantly more

185

inhibited than the four site point mutant at 12 hpi (p<0.0001, unpaired t test), this result

186

suggests that the individual miR-142-3p binding site sequences may not be the primary

187

elements in the 3’ UTR that promote mosquito replication, but potentially, a sequence-

188

dependent RNA secondary structure or other specific sequence is critical.

189

Together, these data demonstrate that while mutations in the miR-142-3p binding

190

sites do not alter virus replication in non-miR-142-3p expressing cells, mutations in 3 of

191

the miR-142-3p binding sites results in EEEV replicative escape from miR-142-3p

192

suppression in myeloid cells. Therefore, 2 or more miR-142-3p binding sites are

193

required for significant suppression of EEEV myeloid cell replication in vitro

194

demonstrating that cooperativity between the miR-142-3p binding sites enhances EEEV

195

suppression.

196
197

Combinatorial mutation of the EEEV miR-142-3p binding sites increases virus

198

attenuation in mice.

199

We have previously demonstrated that deletion of all of the miR-142-3p binding

200

sites (virus 11337) resulted in virus attenuation in vivo due to increased myeloid cell

201

replication and systemic IFN-a/b production [4]. Since decreasing the number of

202

functional miR-142-3p binding sites resulted in increased myeloid cell replication in vitro,

203

we sought to determine whether a similar phenomenon could be observed in vivo. In

204

CD-1 mice infected with viruses lacking a single miR-142-3p binding site (single

205

mutants), only mutation of site 4 lead to a significant increase in survival compared to

206

WT EEEV (Figure 3A); there were no significant survival differences with mutation of

207

sites 1, 2, or 3 alone. Mutation of two miR-142-3p binding sites (double mutants)

208

resulted in greater attenuation and higher percent survival compared to the single

209

mutants; however, virus attenuation was dependent on the combination of sites that

210

were mutated. The virus with sites 3 and 4 mutated (34) had the highest survival rate of

211

the double mutants and was significantly attenuated with 50% survival compared to WT

212

EEEV (Figure 3A). Percent survival was also significantly higher in mice infected with

213

the 13, 14, and 23 viruses compared to WT EEEV but lower than the 34 mutant. There

214

was no significant survival difference in mice infected with the 12 and 24 mutant viruses

215

compared to WT EEEV.

216

Infection of mice with viruses encoding three mutant miR-142-3p binding sites

217

and only one functional miR-142-3p binding site (triple mutants) resulted in significant

218

survival differences for all of the mutants compared to WT EEEV (Figure 3A).

219

Additionally, percent survival for the mutant viruses 134 and 234 was higher than that of

220

the double mutants, but not to the level of 11337 or the quadruple mutant 1234 virus.

221

Finally, mice infected with the mutant 1234 virus was not significantly different than

222

11337. We also observed similar survival percentages of the miR-142-3p binding site

223

mutants in inbred C57BL/6 mice compared to CD-1 mice (S1 Figure).

224

Together these results demonstrate that, similar to our data on virus replication in

225

myeloid cells, reduction in the number of miR-142-3p binding sites leads to increased

226

survival and higher virus attenuation in vivo. Importantly, none of the 1, 2, or 3 site point

227

mutants were similarly attenuated to the four-site mutant 1234 or 11337, suggesting

228

each of the four miR-142-3p binding sites, including the non-canonical site (site 2)

229

contributes to the fully virulent phenotype of the WT virus. There was little significant

230

difference in attenuation between viruses with similar numbers of mutations. Mutant

231

virus 4 was significantly attenuated compared to mutant 1 (P<0.05) and mutant 34 virus

232

was significantly attenuated compared to 12 (P<0.01), which may suggest a higher

233

impact of site 4 that other sites on virulence in vivo. Yet overall, the data indicate that

234

each miR142-3p binding site contributes to EEEV virulence.

235
236

Early virus replication in popliteal lymph nodes and inflammatory response is dependent

237

on the number of miR-142-3p binding sites

238

We also previously demonstrated that the miR-142-3p binding site mutant,

239

11337, rescued virus replication in the popliteal lymph nodes (PLN) in vivo early after

240

infection compared to WT EEEV [4]. Therefore, we next determined whether or not

241

combinatorial mutation of the miR-142-3p sites led to differences in virus replication in

242

the PLNs early after infection. CD-1 mice were infected with the nLuc-expressing EEEV

243

mutant viruses and the PLNs were harvested 12 hpi, and virus replication was

244

quantified by nLuc analysis. In the PLNs, the deletion mutant 11337 virus had the

245

highest level of virus replication at 12 hpi (Figure 3B), which was significantly higher

246

than WT. Replication of the four site mutation virus, 1234, and the triple mutant viruses

247

were higher than either the single or double mutant viruses, but lower than the 11337

248

mutant virus. All of the triple mutant viruses except mutant 123 had significantly higher

249

levels of virus replication in the PLN compared to WT although that mutant exhibited a

250

trend toward higher replication. Of the double mutants, only mutants 34 (P<0.05) had

251

significantly higher replication than WT. Replication of the single site mutation viruses

252

was not significantly different form the WT, although the site 4 mutant exhibited a trend

253

towards higher replication evidenced in some animals. These results are similar to the

254

in vitro results in myeloid cells in that the mutant viruses with 2 or 3 functional miR-142-

255

3p binding sites showed restricted viral replication. In summary, elimination of 3 miR-

256

142-3p binding sites conferred myeloid cell replication leading to higher virus levels of

257

nLuc in the PLN. Virus replication in vivo was more variable after infection than in

258

cultured myeloid cells suggesting that other factors potentially including variability in the

259

expression of miR-142-3p in PLN cells or numbers of myeloid cells could be influencing

260

PLN replication.

261

Myeloid cell replication by the mutant 11337 virus leads to IFN-a/b production in

262

vivo by 12 hpi [4]. We hypothesized that decreasing the number of miR-142-3p binding

263

sites would lead to higher levels of systemic IFN-a/b contributing to the virus attenuation

264

that is seen in vivo. At 12 hpi, serum IFN-a/b, measured by bioassay, was undetectable

265

in WT and single mutation viruses with the exception of two mice infected with the site 4

266

mutant (Figure 3C). This is consistent with the trend for site 4 mutant viruses towards

267

higher PLN replication and significant attenuation in vivo demonstrating that activity of 3

268

miR-142-3p binding sites largely suppresses IFN-a/b production except when the miR-

269

142-3p binding site (site 4) is closest to the poly (A) tail. Serum IFN-a/b levels in mice

270

infected with the double mutant viruses was dependent on the particular combination of

271

mutations. Mutant viruses 12 and 14 only had a single mouse with detectable levels of

272

IFN-a/b. Viruses with mutations in sites 23, and 24 led to a higher number of mice with

273

serum IFN-a/b, but the average for the groups was not significantly different from WT.

274

Mutant 13 and 34 were the only double mutant viruses to have significantly higher levels

275

of serum IFN-a/b compared to WT (P<0.01). For the triple mutants, mutant 123 and 234

276

didn't not induce significantly higher levels of IFN-a/b compared to WT.

277

By 24 hpi (Figure 3D), we detected serum IFN-a/b in some mice infected with the

278

WT, and more mice infected with the single mutants and the double mutants than at

279

12hpi. These data suggest there is a delayed induction of IFN-a/b with these viruses

280

compared to 11337 and the other mutants. It is possible that the increased IFN-a/b

281

production by WT may be due to changes in miR-142-3p levels within the PLN as a

282

response to infection, leading to virus replication or, possibly, virus escape of miR-142-

283

3p suppression in myeloid cells due to the presence of higher levels of WT virus in the

284

PLN at 24 hpi compared to 12 hpi [25].

285

Early production of cytokines and chemokines produced by myeloid cells can

286

influence trafficking of immune cells and the induction of the adaptive immune response

287

[26,27]. A single PLN was harvested at 12 hpi from each of three CD-1 mice infected

288

with either WT, 11337 or mock-infected and RNA was isolated for qRT-PCR to quantify

289

cytokine and chemokine mRNA levels using a panel of cytokine and chemokines that

290

are involved in trafficking and induction of the adaptive immune response, specifically

291

trafficking of immune cells to peripheral tissues during infection [26]. Significantly higher

292

mRNA levels of the inflammatory cytokines Ifnb, Ifng, Il6, and Il1b and chemokines

293

Cxcl10, Ccl3, and Ccl2 were detected in 11337-infected PLN compared to WT-infected

294

PLN. (S2A Figure). For both Ccl4 and Cxcl1, statistical significance was influenced by

295

several WT-infected mice that had high mRNA levels in the PLN, but overall WT-

296

infected mice had lower levels compared to 11337-infected mice.

297

To further examine the relationship of myeloid cell replication and the number of

298

miR-142-3p binding sites to induction of chemokine mRNAs within the PLN, we

299

quantified the level of Cxcl10 mRNA within the PLN after infection with each of EEEV

300

mutants at 12 hpi (S2B Figure). Similar to IFN-a/b levels in the serum, Cxcl10 mRNA

301

levels in the PLN depended on the number of miR-142-3p binding sites. Mice infected

302

with WT and the single mutants had similar levels of Cxcl10 mRNA within their PLN.

303

Mice infected with the double mutant virus 34 had significantly (P<0.001) higher levels

304

of Cxcl10 mRNA compared to WT. Mutant 123 of the triple mutant viruses didn't not

305

significantly increase Cxcl10 mRNA within the PLN, but all of the other triple mutant

306

viruses, the quadruple mutant 1234, and 11337 had significantly higher levels of Cxcl10

307

mRNA. Together, our results demonstrate the increasing myeloid cell replication leads

308

to not only higher levels of serum IFN-a/b, but also higher mRNAs levels of

309

inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the PLN. Overall, these results demonstrate

310

that, similar to myeloid cells in vitro, the four miR-142-3p binding sites in the EEEV 3’

311

UTR have a cumulative effect upon PLN replication and response, and overall

312

virulence, However, deficiency in site 4 does have a consistent but not always

313

significantly greater effect upon these factors.

314
315

Virus-cell interaction in the PLN influences replication in CNS

316

As we have demonstrated above, reducing the number of miR-142-3p binding

317

sites in the EEEV 3’ UTR leads to increased virus attenuation in vivo. An important

318

question regarding the pathogenesis of arboviral encephalitic viruses is whether or not

319

attenuation of encephalitis-causing viruses can be influenced by responses elicited in

320

tissues outside the CNS. This is particularly significant with EEEV as we have proposed

321

that failure to elicit a robust peripheral innate immune response contributes to the

322

extreme virulence of the virus. Tissues from CD-1 mice infected with the EEEV mutants

323

were harvested 96 hours post infection to measure virus replication in the PLN, spleen,

324

and several regions of the brain. In the PLN and spleen, the triple, quadruple and 11337

325

mutant viruses all had lower levels of mean virus replication compared to WT (S3

326

Figure). These mutants also elicited higher levels of serum IFN-a/b than WT at 12 hpi.

327

There was no difference in virus replication between WT and the single or double

328

mutants at this time point suggesting that early IFN-a/b production by the triple,

329

quadruple, and 11337 (Figure 3C), in the absence of complete miR-142-3p restriction,

330

led to reduced virus replication in situ in the PLN and spleen.

331

We previously demonstrated that higher levels of serum IFN-a/b lead to

332

increased STAT1 phosphorylation and, presumably, upregulation of the IFN-induced

333

antiviral state in brain tissue at early times post EEEV infection prior to neuroinvasion by

334

the virus [28]. At 96 hours post infection with the EEEV mutants, we harvested the

335

cortex, subcortex, cerebellum and olfactory bulbs to measure virus replication by nLuc

336

analysis. WT-infected mice exhibited high levels of virus replication in all brain regions

337

(Figure 4A-D) corresponding to the time when WT EEEV infected mice begin to

338

succumb to infection (Figure 3A). Similar levels of virus replication were also detected in

339

the different regions of the brain infected with the single mutants and double mutants.

340

Even though all of the mice infected with the double mutant viruses had virus replication

341

in the different regions of the brain, not all mice succumbed to infection (Figure 3A).

342

Virus replication was significantly lower for the triple mutants, the quadruple

343

mutant 1234, and the deletion mutant 11337, compared to WT in all four regions of the

344

brain. In fact, virus replication of these mutants was also lower than the single and

345

double mutants at this time point. As further evidence of the contribution of extraneural

346

replication to the attenuated phenotype of binding site mutants, we found that the WT

347

and the most attenuated 11337 mutant viruses caused similar virulence when give

348

intracerebrally to CD-1 mice (S4 Figure). These results demonstrate that the miR-142-

349

3p binding sites not only suppress virus replication in the PLN early after infection, but

350

the IFN-a/b induced early after infection reduces virus dissemination to the CNS

351

contributing to the attenuation of these viruses in vivo.

352
353

Spontaneous mutation miR-142-3p binding sites may contribute to changing EEEV

354

phenotypes as infection progresses.

355

EEEV is primarily transmitted between ornithophilic mosquitoes and passerine

356

birds, but infections do occur in humans and horses, both of which are considered

357

dead-end hosts [29] and, therefore, should not contribute to the host-driven evolution of

358

the virus. Mosquito cell lines do not express miR-142-3p [4,30] while avian

359

hematopoietic cell lines do [31]; however, it may be expressed at lower levels than in

360

mammal hematopoietic cell lines [4]. Importantly, without the miR-142-3p binding sites

361

in the 3’ UTR, EEEV cannot establish a productive infection in mosquitoes [4],

362

suggesting that the miR-142-3p binding sites are maintained due to selective pressures

363

in the mosquito-bird life cycle but not during replication in humans or possibly mice as

364

human disease models. Remarkably, the sequence of the region of the EEEV 3’UTR

365

containing the miR-142-3p binding sites is identical between currently circulating viruses

366

and viruses isolated in the 1930’s, also suggesting a strong selective pressure for

367

conservation [4]. Therefore, we sought to determine if some of the altering phenotype

368

of EEEV during mouse infection, such as the increase in serum IFN-ab levels in mice

369

infected with the WT or single mutation viruses between 12 and 24 hpi (Figure 3C-D),

370

might be associated with a reduction in miR-142-3p restriction in myeloid cell infection.

371

Interestingly, in RAW cells and interferon non-responsive mouse BMDCs, between 24

372

and 48 hpi, WT EEEV appears to escape miR-142-3p suppression and replicates to

373

high titers (Figure 5A-B).

374

To detect escape mutations in vitro and in vivo, RNA was isolated from WT

375

EEEV-infected RAW cells (48 hpi), Ifnar-/- bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs)

376

(24 hpi and 48 hpi), mouse brains, sera, and cervical lymph nodes (CVLN) at times >24

377

hours post infection. PCR amplification of the 3’ UTR led to the identification of a subset

378

of amplified fragments in all amplified RNA that were smaller than the WT amplicon;

379

however, with mouse samples, these fragments did not represent the majority of the

380

viral population (data not shown). By comparison, in BMDCs, at 24 hpi a majority of the

381

population was similar to WT (~750nt), but by 48 hpi, the predominant viral population

382

had a much shorter 3’ UTR more similar to 11337 (Figure 5C). In general, 3’UTR length

383

variations were of multiple lengths (S5 Figure). However, amplicon sequencing revealed

384

that in all circumstances, deletions encompassed most or all four of the miR-142-3p

385

binding sites and the sequence of one sample from the serum of an infected mouse was

386

identical to the 11337 mutation (mutation 11337-11596). Two samples from the brains

387

of B6 mice had identical deletions (11355-11601). These results demonstrate that the

388

miR-142-3p binding sites are not stable during EEEV infection in a model of human

389

disease.

390
391

miR-142-3p binding sites are present in the EEEV-derived 3’ UTR of western equine

392

encephalitis virus.

393

Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) is a recombinant alphavirus

394

consisting of the 5’ UTR, nonstructural proteins, capsid protein, and part of the 3’ UTR

395

of EEEV and the structural proteins (E3, E2, and E1) and the initial 60 nucleotides (nt)

396

of the SINV 3’ UTR [32,33]. Like EEEV, replication of WEEV is inhibited in human

397

peripheral blood leukocytes[34]. Since part of the WEEV 3’ UTR is derived from an

398

EEEV progenitor, we hypothesized that the 3’ UTR may also contain miR-142-3p

399

binding sites. Screening of the WEEV 3’ UTR of the McMillan strain (McM) identified

400

four potential miR-142-3p binding sites located at different positions relative to the poly

401

(A) tract and each other (Figure 6A-B) as compared to the miR-142-3p binding sites in

402

the EEEV 3’ UTR (Figure 1A). Two of the miR-142-3p binding sites, beginning at nt

403

11347 and 11369, have canonical seed sequence matches, but they overlap in the 3’

404

UTR by 6 nts. The other 2 miR-142-3p binding sites, beginning at 11405 and 11429,

405

have a G:U wobble at position 2 of the seed sequence suggesting they may be non-

406

canonical (Figure 6B).

407

To determine whether the miR-142-3p binding sites within the WEEV 3’ UTR

408

suppress WEEV replication in myeloid cells, we made a deletion mutant, WEEV-11224,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/649525; this version posted May 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

409

that deletes 226 nucleotides from the 3’ UTR that eliminates all of the miR-142-3p

410

binding sites similar to the 11337 deletion in EEEV[4]. In BHK cells, both WEEV McM

411

and WEEV-11224 replicated with similar growth kinetics demonstrating that the deletion

412

in the 3’ UTR had no effect on virus replication in miR-142-3p deficient cells (Figure 6C)

413

[4,30]. In RAW cells that express miR-142-3p [4], both WEEV McM and WT EEEV did

414

not replicate (Figure 6D). Deletion of the miR-142-3p binding sties in McM (WEEV

415

11224 virus) resulted in a 2-log increase in virus replication at 24 hpi compared to

416

WEEV McM (P<0.01). By comparison, EEEV 11337 replicated to a ~4-log higher titer

417

than WEEV 11224 at 24 hpi. Differences between EEEV and WEEV in relative growth

418

of WT viruses and miR-142-3p deletion mutants may reflect differential sensitivity to

419

mutant-induced interferon responses or other myeloid cell factors as similar responses

420

were since in Ifnar-/- BMMf (Figure 6E). Like EEEV 11337, WEEV 11224 is also

421

inhibited in replicating in C6/36 mosquito cells (Figure 6F) suggesting a common

422

function of this region between WEEV and EEEV in establishing mosquito replication.

423

Finally, sc infection of mice revealed that the 11224 mutant was attenuated (P=0.052)

424

versus the WT WEEV McM (25% versus 75% mortality, respectively) (Figure 6G).

425

Attenuation of the EEEV miR-142-3p deletion mutant 11337 is due to differential type I

426

IFN induction[4], therefore we infected Ifnar-/- mice to determine whether WEEV 11224

427

was similarly attenuated by the type I IFN response. Survival times and mortality of

428

Ifnar-/- mice infected with WEEV McM and WEEV 11224 were not distinguishable

429

(Figure 6G) demonstrating that type I IFN is needed for the attenuation of WEEV 11224

430

compared to WEEV McM. Thus, similar to EEEV, the miR-142-3p binding sites in the

DISCUSSION

434

miRNAs function in a cell and tissue specific manner to prevent translation of

435

cellular mRNAs. Recent evidence demonstrates that cellular miRNAs can interact with

436

RNA viruses to either suppress RNA translation via interaction with 3’ UTRs or enhance

437

virus replication by interacting with 5’ UTRs (reviewed in [19]). Artificial insertion of

438

miRNA binding sites into viral 3’ UTRs has been used to restrict virus replication in

439

specific cells or tissues to understand the contribution of these cells and tissues to viral

440

pathogenesis. These experiments require insertion of multiple highly complementary

441

miRNA sequences in specific locations and distances from each other to achieve

442

efficient viral suppression [22,23,30,35,36]. However, miRNA natural binding sites in

443

viral 3’ UTRs are not completely complimentary nor are they arranged at uniform

444

distances from each other [4]. We have used point mutations to determine the role of

445

each of four naturally occurring canonical and non-canonical miR-142-3p sites whose

446

stringent restriction of myeloid cell replication drives the severity of encephalitis caused

447

by EEEV, one of the most acutely virulent viruses endemic to the Americas. Through

448

these studies, we have confirmed that miR-142-3p interacts with the EEEV 3’ UTR as

449

part of the RISC complex in myeloid cells in vitro and we have determined that all four

450

of the miR142-3p sites, including the non-canonical site 2, contribute to EEEV virulence.

451

Furthermore, we demonstrate that another encephalitic alphavirus, WEEV, achieves

452

virulence through miR-142-3p restriction.

453

Viruses [22] and cellular mRNA [37-39] encoding multiple miRNA binding site are

454

more suppressed than viruses and mRNA encoding only a single miRNA binding site.

455

This interaction between two or more miRNA binding sites leading to enhanced

456

repression of the target RNA over a single miRNA binding site is called cooperativity

457

[38-40]. Cooperativity between miRNAs is most optimal when the seed sequences of

458

the miRNA binding sites are spaced 13-35 nucleotides apart [40]. Also, the location of a

459

miRNA binding site in the 3’ UTR within 15 nucleotides from the stop codon can

460

increase efficacy and repression of the target RNA [38]. However, not all naturally

461

encoded viral miRNA interaction domains encode more than one miRNA binding site

462

[17,18,41,42], and if there is more than one miRNA binding site, the sites may not be

463

ideally located based on the aforementioned guidelines for cooperativity.

464

For EEEV, the number of miR-142-3p binding sites rather than their location

465

within the 3’ UTR was dominant in the suppression of EEEV replication. EEEV mutants

466

with 2 or more miR-142-3p binding sites were suppressed in replication in myeloid cells

467

in vitro to WT EEEV and in vivo in the PLN. Once a third miR-142-3p binding site was

468

removed from the 3’ UTR leaving only one intact miR-142-3p binding site, EEEV virus

469

replication was rescued in myeloid cells and the PLN. Even though replication was

470

detected with the triple mutant viruses, it was still lower than the quadruple miR-142-3p

471

mutant, 1234, and the deletion mutant, 11337 indicating that each miR-142-3p binding

472

site contributes to EEEV restriction in vitro. However, it should be noted that mutant 4

473

exhibited a non-significant but consistent trend towards higher replication potentially

474

implying a more substantial contribution to EEEV restriction that the other binding sites.

475

With in vivo morbidity/mortality studies, which appeared to distinguish more

476

precisely between effects of individual binding sites, some of the single, double, and

477

triple mutants were significantly attenuated in comparison with WT EEEV. Of the single

478

mutants, the mutant EEEV virus lacking site 4 was the most attenuated. This miR-142-

479

3p binding site is located the closest to the poly (A) tail, a known factor in enhancing

480

miRNA restriction of cellular mRNA [38], and its position within the UTR may underlie

481

greater replication restriction observed in vitro and in vivo. The mutant virus 34, which

482

was mutated in two sites that are only separated by 8 nucleotides, was the most

483

attenuated double mutant virus compared to WT EEEV. This suggests that there is

484

some positional effect for these sites that may enhance cooperativity. Of the triple

485

mutants, the viruses mutated in both sites 3 and 4 in conjunction with either site 1 or 2

486

were the most attenuated, again suggesting greater contribution of site 4 and an

487

interaction between sites 3 and 4.

488

All of the triple mutants were attenuated, but more virulent than the quadruple

489

mutant 1234 or 11337. Site two with a G:U wobble at position 2 of the seed sequence is

490

a non-canonical miRNA binding site due to a potential offset 6-mer binding site that has

491

complementarity between nucleotides 3-8 of the seed sequence and the EEEV 3’ UTR

492

[43]. The nullification of this non-canonical site in the mutant 134 still resulted in

493

increased mortality during infection compared to 1234 and 11337. Therefore, our data

494

demonstrate that each miR-142-3p binding site, even the non-canonical site 2, is

495

involved in suppression of virus replication in myeloid cells and attenuation of EEEV

496

disease. However, as noted, site 4 may be the most restrictive by itself and positional

497

effects between sites 3 and 4 may enhance cooperativity yielding the greater

498

suppression of replication.

499

It can be argued that the binding of miRNAs to viral RNAs can lead to

500

sequestration of the miRNA leading changes in the host transcriptome due to

501

derepression of previously repressed targets [13,44] and with EEEV, potentially causing

502

altered myeloid cell responses to infection. However, the binding of miRNAs to viral

503

RNA is unlikely to result in changes in the cellular transcriptome through sequestration

504

of the free miRNA early after infection when viral genomes are limited. We previously

505

demonstrated with EEEV, that initial translation of the infecting virus genome is

506

restricted by miR-142-3p and subsequent replication is greatly suppressed [4]. Here we

507

show that EEEV RNA associates with Ago complexes and therefore, is directed into

508

translation repression pathways. Furthermore if the miRNA is highly expressed within

509

the cell, as with miR-142-3p in myeloid cells [3], the number of miR-142-3p molecules

510

will greatly exceed EEEV RNA molecules particularly early after infection. The loss of a

511

small number of miR-142-3p molecules due EEEV sequestration should not

512

quantitatively change the levels of miR-142-3p within myeloid cells.

513

Our results also point to an effect of replication efficiency in initial infection sites

514

on subsequent CNS disease severity. IFN-a/b production by the triple, quadruple and

515

11337 mutants at 12 hpi resulted in reduced virus dissemination to the CNS (Figure 5)

516

suggesting that the initial innate immune responses within 12 hours after infection can

517

influence events in tissues distant form the site of infection. We have previously shown

518

production of serum IFN can lead to an upregulation of STAT1 transcription factor

519

phosphorylation in the CNS [28]. Furthermore, WT EEEV and the 11337 mutant,

520

missing all four sites, were equally virulent when virus was delivered ic. Therefore, the

521

early IFN response in the triple, quadruple and 11337 deletion mutants may help to

522

prime the innate immune response in the CNS to restrict virus replication and lessen

523

disease severity. Myeloid cell production of cytokines and chemokines are also integral

524

to the induction of both the innate and adaptive immune responses in vivo [26,27]. The

525

inability of EEEV to replicate in tissue-specific myeloid cells may also lead to

526

suppression of the cytokine and chemokine leading to inadequate induction of the

527

adaptive immune responses in the spleen, or recruitment of important cell types to the

528

CNS needed for neuroprotection. We infer that limitations in neuroprotective adaptive

529

immune responses may also contribute to the extremely high mortality rate in

530

symptomatic EEEV cases.

531

There is remarkable conservation of the EEEV 3’ UTRs that have been isolated

532

from nature with a majority of the EEEV strains having nearly identical sequence and

533

location of the miR-142-3p binding sites as the prototype strain EEEV FL93-939 [4]. Our

534

data suggests that requirements for mosquito cell replication exert a strong selective

535

pressure for maintenance of the miR-142-3p sites (current studies and [4]), which may

536

explain such conservation. However, we found that in mammalian cells and hosts, the

537

lack of a selective pressure results in generation of escape mutants that lack the miR-

538

142-3p binding sites. Similarly, artificial miR-142-3p binding sites introduced into

539

Dengue virus were deleted during the course of mouse infection [30]. The EEEV

540

mutations we observed rendered all four of the miR-142-3p sites non-functional

541

reinforcing the contribution of all sites to EEEV replication restriction.

542

Finally, we have shown that WEEV, a natural recombinant SINV/EEEV virus that

543

derived its 3’ UTR sequences from an EEEV-like ancestor, contains four binding sites

544

for miR-142-3p (Figure 6), but in different locations in the 3’ UTR compared to EEEV.

545

Deletion of the binding sites from WEEV rescued virus replication in myeloid cells and

546

attenuated the mutant virus in mice, while also suppressing replication in mosquito cells.

547

Therefore, we suggest that multiple members of the encephalitic alphaviruses express

548

virulence factors conferred by miRNA binding. It is of interest that the other major

549

encephalitic alphavirus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, has a much shorter 3’

550

UTR than EEEV or WEEV [45], does not possess miR-142-3p binding sites and is

551

highly myeloid cell tropic [2].

552

In summary, our data demonstrate that the miR-142-3p binding sites

553

cooperatively suppress EEEV 3’ UTR replication in myeloid cells thereby enhancing

554

virulence in vivo. miRNA binding sites are being used to limit tissue tropism in the

555

generation of live-attenuated vaccine candidates [22,23]. However, these artificial

556

miRNA binding sites are usually complimentary to the entire miRNA [22,23,30], which is

557

rarely found in naturally occurring viral RNAs [4,13-17]. Furthermore, when artificial

558

miRNA binding sites are grouped together, viral escape of miRNA suppression can

559

occur through deletion of the inserted miRNA binding sites [22,30], leading to potential

560

adverse events.

the EEEV FL93 genome (EF151502.1) and WEEV McMillan genome (GQ287640.1). All

707

statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software. All experiments

708

were repeated at least twice as indicated in Figure Legends. For IP, unpaired t test was

709

performed to compared between groups. For the EEEV point mutant in vitro and in vivo

710

data, a one-way analysis of variance was performed of the log-transformed data with

711

corrections for multiple comparison using the Holm-Sidak method comparing each

712

mutant to WT. An unpaired t-test was used to compare 11337 to mutant 1234 in the

713

growth curve experiments in C6/36 cells. Box-and whisker plots represent min-max with

714

bar representing the median value. Statistical significance for survival curves was
