Abstract
Adaptive mutations play an important role in molecular evolution. However, the frequency and nature
of these mutations at the intra-molecular level is poorly understood. To address this, we analysed the
impact of protein architecture on the rate of adaptive substitutions, aiming to understand how protein
biophysics influences fitness and adaptation. Using Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana
population genomics data, we fitted models of distribution of fitness effects and estimated the rate of
adaptive amino-acid substitutions both at the protein and amino-acid residue level. We performed a
comprehensive analysis covering genome, gene and protein structure, by exploring a multitude of factors
with a plausible impact on the rate of adaptive evolution, such as intron number, protein length,
secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, intrinsic protein disorder, chaperone affinity, gene
expression, protein function and protein-protein interactions. We found that the relative solvent
accessibility is a major driver of adaptive evolution, with most adaptive mutations occurring at the
surface of proteins. Moreover, we observe that the rate of adaptive substitutions differs between protein
functional classes, with genes encoding for protein biosynthesis and degradation signalling exhibiting
the fastest rates of protein adaptation. Overall, our results suggest that adaptive evolution in proteins is
mainly driven by inter-molecular interactions, with host-pathogen coevolution likely playing a major
role.

Introduction
A long-standing focus in the study of molecular evolution is the role of natural selection in protein
evolution (Eyre-Walker 2006). One can measure the strength and direction of selection at the divergence
level through the 𝑑" /𝑑$ ratio (w). However, because w represents a summary statistic across nucleotide
sites, it can only provide the average trend, while proteins will typically undergo both negative and

positive selection. Because adaptive mutations contribute relatively more to substitution than to
polymorphism, we can disentangle the two types of selection by contrasting the number of substitutions
to the number of polymorphisms at synonymous and non-synonymous sites, as implemented in the
McDonald and Kreitman (MK) test (McDonald and Kreitman 1991). Charlesworth (1994) extended the
MK test to estimate the proportion of substitutions that are adaptive (a). Yet, one limitation of this
approach was that it didn’t account for the segregation of slightly deleterious mutations, which can either
over- or underestimate measurements of a according to the demography of the population (Eyre-Walker
2002; Smith and Eyre-Walker 2002). Recent methods solved this issue by taking into consideration the
distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of both slightly deleterious (Fay et al. 2001; Smith and Eyre-Walker
2002; Bierne and Eyre-Walker 2004; Eyre-Walker et al. 2006; Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009;
Stoletzki and Eyre-Walker 2011) and slightly beneficial mutations (Galtier 2016; Tataru et al. 2017).

By allowing the estimation of the rate of non-adaptive (𝜔&' = 𝑑𝑁 /𝑑𝑆 ) and adaptive (𝜔' = w − 𝜔&' )

non-synonymous substitutions, in addition to measurements of a (𝜔' /w), these methods triggered new
insights on the impact of both negative and positive selection on the rate of protein evolution.
Several studies have reported substantial levels of adaptive protein evolution in various animal
species, including the fruit fly (Smith and Eyre-Walker 2002; Sawyer et al. 2003; Bierne and EyreWalker 2004; Haddrill et al. 2010), the wild mouse (Halligan et al. 2010) and the European rabbit
(Carneiro et al. 2012), but also in bacteria (Charlesworth and Eyre-Walker 2006) and in plants
(Ingvarsson 2010; Slotte et al. 2010; Strasburg et al. 2011). Whereas for other taxa, such as primates
(Boyko et al. 2008; Hvilsom et al. 2012; Galtier 2016), and many other plants (Gossmann et al. 2010),
the rate of adaptive mutations was observed to be very low, wherein amino-acid substitutions are
expected to be nearly neutral and fixed mainly through random genetic drift (Boyko et al. 2008). Several
authors proposed that this across-species variation in the molecular adaptive rate is explained by an
effective population size (𝑁0 ) effect, where higher rates of adaptive evolution are observed for species
with larger 𝑁0 due to a lower impact of genetic drift (Eyre-Walker 2006; Eyre-Walker and Keightley
2009; Gossmann et al. 2012). Galtier (2016), however, reported that 𝑁0 had an impact on a and 𝜔&' but
not 𝜔' . Hence, he proposed that the relationship with 𝑁0 is mainly explained by deleterious effects,
wherein slightly deleterious non-synonymous substitutions accumulate at lower rates in large-𝑁0 species
due to a higher efficiency of purifying selection, thus decreasing w and consequently inflating a.
The rate of adaptive substitutions, however, was observed to vary extensively along the genome.
On a genome-wide scale, it was reported that 𝜔' correlates positively with both the recombination and
mutation rates, but negatively with gene density (Campos et al. 2014; Castellano et al. 2016). When
looking at the gene level, previous studies have demonstrated the role of protein function in the rate of
adaptive evolution, wherein genes involved in immune defence mechanisms appear with higher rates of
adaptive mutations in Drosophila (Sackton et al. 2007; Obbard et al. 2009), humans and chimpanzees
(Nielsen et al. 2005). In Drosophila, sex-related genes also display higher levels of adaptive evolution,
being directly linked with species differentiation (Pröschel et al. 2006; Haerty et al. 2007). At the intra2

genic level, however, the frequency and nature of adaptive mutations remain poorly understood.
There are several structural factors that have been reported to influence the rate of protein
evolution but have not been investigated at the population level. Molecular evolution studies of protein
families revealed that protein structure, for instance, significantly impacts the rate of amino-acid
substitutions, with exposed residues evolving faster than buried ones (Liberles et al. 2012). As a stable
conformation is often required to ensure proper protein function, mutations that impair the stability or
the structural conformation of the folded protein are more likely to be counter-selected. Moreover,
distinct sites in a protein sequence differ in the extent of conformational change they endure upon
mutation, a pattern generally well predicted by the relative solvent accessibility of a residue (Goldman
et al. 1998; Mirny and Shakhnovich 1999; Franzosa and Xia 2009). In this way, residues at the core of
proteins evolve slower than the ones at the surface due to their role in maintaining a stable protein
structure (Perutz et al. 1965; Overington et al. 1992; Goldman et al. 1998; Bustamante et al. 2000; Dean
et al. 2002; Choi et al. 2006; Lin et al. 2007; Conant and Stadler 2009; Franzosa and Xia 2009; Ramsey
et al. 2011). Inter-specific comparative sequence analyses also revealed that positively selected sites are
often found at the surface of proteins (Proux et al. 2009; Adams et al. 2017). Hence, exploring the role
that these structural elements play in shaping the rate of adaptive evolution is crucial in order to fully
understand what are the main drivers of adaptation within proteomes. Inter-specific comparisons,
however, do not permit to disentangle the effect of relaxed purifying selection from adaptation-driven
increase in substitutions rates. Such insights can only be obtained by contrasting patterns of
polymorphisms and divergence.
Our study addresses protein adaptive evolution at a fine scale by analysing the impact of several
functional variables among protein-coding regions at the population level. To further assess the potential
generality of the inferred effects, we carried our comparison on two model species with distinct lifehistory traits: the dipter Drosophila melanogaster and the brassicaceae Arabidopsis thaliana. We fitted
models of DFE and estimated the rate of adaptive substitutions, both at the protein and amino-acid
residue scale, across several variables and found that solvent exposure is the most significant factor
influencing protein adaptation, with exposed residues undergoing ten times faster 𝜔' than buried ones.
Moreover, we observed that the functional class of proteins has also a strong impact on the rate of protein
adaptation, with genes encoding for processes of protein regulation and signaling pathways exhibiting
the highest 𝜔' values. We therefore hypothesized that inter-molecular interactions are the main drivers
of adaptive substitutions in proteins. This hypothesis is consistent with the proposal that, at the interorganism level, coevolution with pathogens constitute a so-far under-assessed component of protein
evolution (Sackton et al. 2007; Obbard et al. 2009; Enard et al. 2016; Mauch-Mani et al. 2017).

Results and Discussion
In order to identify the genomic and structural variants driving protein adaptive evolution we looked at
10,318 protein-coding genes for Drosophila melanogaster, analyzing polymorphism data from an

admixed sub-Saharan population (DPGP2, Pool et al. 2012) and divergence out to D. simulans; and
18,669 protein-coding genes for Arabidopsis thaliana, with polymorphism data from a Spanish
population (1001 Genomes Project, Weigel and Mott 2009) and divergence to A. lyrata. The rate of
adaptive evolution was estimated with the Grapes program (Galtier 2016). The Grapes method extends
the approach pioneered by the DoFE program (Fay et al. 2001; Smith and Eyre-Walker 2002; Bierne
and Eyre-Walker 2004; Eyre-Walker et al. 2006; Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009; Stoletzki and EyreWalker 2011), by explicitly accounting for mutations with slightly advantageous effects. Grapes
estimates the rate of non-adaptive non-synonymous substitutions (𝜔&' ), which is then used to estimate
the rate of adaptive non-synonymous substitutions (𝜔' ) and the proportion of adaptive non-synonymous
substitutions (a). A high a can be potentially explained both by a higher 𝜔' or a lower 𝜔&' , and
therefore does not allow to disentangle the two effects. Thus, we explored how, and if, 𝜔' and 𝜔&' , as
well as the total w, depend on the different functional variables analysed here.
Results from model comparison of DFE showed that the Gamma-Exponential model is the one
that best fits our data according to Akaike’s information criterion (Akaike 1973) (Table S1 in
supplementary File S1). This model combines a Gamma distribution of deleterious mutations with an
exponential distribution of beneficial mutations. In agreement with previous surveys within animal
species, this model suggests the existence of slightly deleterious, as well as slightly beneficial
segregating mutations in D. melanogaster and A. thaliana genomes (Galtier 2016). Genome-wide
estimates of 𝜔' for A. thaliana and D. melanogaster are 0.05 and 0.09, respectively, and are in the range
of previously reported estimates for these species (Bierne and Eyre-Walker 2004; Gossmann et al. 2012;
Smith and Eyre-Walker 2002).
We then categorized genes and amino-acid residues in order to investigate the main drivers of
protein adaptive evolution. We distinguished two types of analyses: gene-based and site-based, where
we looked into how the molecular adaptive rate varies across different categories of genes and aminoacid residues, respectively. Gene-based analyses allowed us to explore the impact of the background
recombination rate, number of introns and mean expression levels. At the protein level, we investigated
the effect of binding affinity to the molecular chaperone DnaK, protein length, cellular localization of
proteins, protein functional class and number of protein-protein interactions. Finally, site-based analyses
enabled us to study the effect of the secondary structure of the protein, by comparing residues present
in b-sheets, a-helices and loops; the tertiary structure, by considering the relative solvent accessibility
of a residue (RSA) and the residue intrinsic disorder; and whether an amino-acid residue participated or
not in an annotated active site.
The impact of gene and genome architecture on adaptive evolution
To study the impact of gene and genome architecture on the rate of adaptive evolution we looked at
recombination rate and the number of introns. Recombination rate was previously reported to favour the
fixation of adaptive mutations in Drosophila by breaking down linkage disequilibrium (Marais and

Charlesworth 2003; Hill and Robertson 2008; Castellano et al. 2016). We analysed this by looking at
50 and 30 categories of recombination rate for A. thaliana and D. melanogaster, respectively. For
Drosophila, we found a significant positive correlation in estimates of 𝜔' with increasing levels of
recombination rate (Kendall’s t = 0.384, p = 0.0029; Figure S1 and File S2), which is consistent with
previous studies (Castellano et al. 2016). This was also observed in A. thaliana (Kendall’s t = 0.206, p
= 0.0343), thus corroborating the effect of recombination in the rate of adaptive evolution.
Previous studies proposed that genes containing more introns are under stronger selective
constraints due to the high cost of transcription, especially in highly expressed genes (Castillo-Davis et
al. 2002). Hence, we would expect regions with more introns to be under stronger purifying selection.
Conversely, by increasing the total gene length, introns might also effectively increase the intra-genic
recombination rate, which could in turn increase the efficacy of positive selection and have a positive
impact on 𝜔' . To disentangle the two effects, we categorized genes based on their intron content, into
13 and 10 categories for A. thaliana and D. melanogaster respectively. Results of 𝜔&' showed
significant negative correlations in D. melanogaster (Kendall’s t = -0.359, p = 0.0876 in A. thaliana; t
= -0.867, p = 0.0005 in D. melanogaster; Figure S2), but we did not find any significant correlation
between the number of introns and 𝜔' (Kendall’s t = -0.154, p = 0.4641 in A. thaliana, t = -0.333, p =
0.1797 in D. melanogaster; Figure S2 and supplementary File S2). These findings suggest that the effect
of the intron content on the rate of protein evolution is essentially due to stronger purifying selection,
while having a negligible influence on the rate of adaptive substitutions.
The impact of protein structure on adaptive evolution
We further explored the impact of three different levels of protein structure (i.e. primary, secondary and
tertiary) on the rate of adaptive evolution. We first looked at the primary structure by categorizing
proteins according to their length. Former studies correlating gene length and 𝑑" /𝑑$ have shown that
smaller genes evolve more rapidly (Zhang 2000; Lipman et al. 2002; Liao et al. 2006). Here, we
investigated if this faster evolution is followed by a higher rate of adaptive substitutions. We performed
the analysis with 30 and 50 categories for A. thaliana and D. melanogaster, respectively. Results show
significant negative correlations with protein length for values of w and 𝜔&' in both species (w:
Kendall’s t = -0.678, p = 1.42e-07 in A. thaliana; t = -0.776, p = 1.79e-15 in D. melanogaster; 𝜔&' : t
= -0.673, p = 1.72e-07 in A. thaliana; t = -0.696, p = 9.66e-13 in D. melanogaster; Figure S3). The same
trend was observed for 𝜔' , although it was only significant in D. melanogaster (Kendall’s t = -0.131, p
= 0.3092 in A. thaliana; t = -0.477, p = 9.91e-07 in D. melanogaster; Figure S3 and supplementary File
S2). These findings suggest that smaller protein-coding regions are indeed under relaxed purifying
selection but might also evolve, in some cases, under a higher rate of adaptive substitutions.
The analysis at the secondary structural level showed significant differences in the evolutionary
rate between the structural motifs, with loops demonstrating the highest values of w, followed by ahelices and b-sheets (pairwise comparisons, see Material and Methods; loops/a-helices: p = 0.0303, all

other estimates: p = 0.0101 in A. thaliana; p = 0.0104 in D. melanogaster; Figure 1). When considering
adaptive and non-adaptive substitutions separately, this effect was only observed between b-sheets and
the two other structural motifs in 𝜔&' in A. thaliana (pairwise comparisons; b-sheets/loops: p = 0.0101,
b-sheets/a-helices: p = 0.0303, a-helices/loops: p = 0.5960 in A. thaliana; b-sheets/loops: p = 0.4062,
b-sheets/a-helices: p = 0.8229, a-helices/loops: p = 0.4271 in D. melanogaster; Figure 1) and among
b-sheets and a-helices in 𝜔' in both species (pairwise comparisons; b-sheets/loops: p = 0.0707, bsheets/a-helices: p = 0.0707, a-helices/loops: p = 0.9191 in A. thaliana; b-sheets/loops: p = 0.0729, bsheets/a-helices: p = 0.0521, a-helices/loops: p = 0.9687 in D. melanogaster; Figure 1 and
supplementary File S3). This implies that the structural motif has an impact on the selective constraints
in A. thaliana and also contributes to the rate of adaptation in the two species. Previous studies
investigating protein tolerance to amino-acid change have similarly shown that loops and turns are the
most mutable, followed by a-helices and b-sheets (Goldman et al. 1998; Guo et al. 2004; Choi et al.
2006). Some authors posed this relationship as an outcome of residue exposure (Goldman et al. 1998;
Guo et al. 2004), while others associate it to the degree of structural disorder, where ordered proteins
are under stronger selective constraint (Choi et al. 2006). In order to clarify this, we further look into
the impact of tertiary structure, by exploring the relationship between residue exposure to solvent and
intrinsic protein disorder with the rate of adaptive evolution.

represented with the black points. Error bars denote for the 95% confidence interval for each category, computed
over 100 bootstrap replicates. The hand-drawings of A. thaliana and D. melanogaster were made by AFM.

Considering the relative solvent accessibility, several studies previously demonstrated that
residues at the surface of proteins evolve faster than the ones at the core (e.g. Goldman et al. 1998; Choi
et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2007; Franzosa and Xia 2009). This higher rate of substitution can be either due
to a reduced selective constraint at exposed residues and/or to an increased rate of adaptive substitutions.
To disentangle the two effects, we compared the site frequency spectra across 28 and 19 categories of
RSA in A. thaliana and D. melanogaster respectively. By using polymorphism data, our results
recapitulate those of previous studies on divergence and demonstrate a significant positive correlation
with solvent exposure for values of w (Kendall’s t = 0.984, p = 1.99e-13 in A. thaliana; t = 0.977, p =
5.14e-09 in D. melanogaster; Figure 2a). Moreover, we demonstrate that both a relaxation of the
selective constraints (𝜔&' : Kendall’s t = 0.846, p = 2.58e-10 in A. thaliana; t = 0.579, p = 5.33e-04 in
D. melanogaster; Figure 2a) and a higher rate of adaptive non-synonymous substitutions (𝜔' : Kendall’s
t = 0.751, p = 2.01e-08 in A. thaliana; t = 0.813, p = 1.16e-06 in D. melanogaster; Figure 2a and
supplementary File S2) explain the higher evolutionary rate at the surface of proteins.
Intrinsically disordered proteins are defined by lacking a well-defined three-dimensional fold
(Dunker et al. 2002; Dyson and Wright 2005), more specifically, proteins with a higher degree of loop
dynamics (“hotloops”) (Linding et al. 2003). As these structures are more flexible we expect them to be
under less structural constraint and to accumulate more substitutions (Guo et al. 2004; Wilke et al. 2005;
Choi et al. 2006), either deleterious and/or beneficial. To test this hypothesis, we asked two different
questions: (1) Are intrinsically disordered protein regions more likely to respond to adaptation? (2) Are
proteins with more disordered regions undergoing more adaptive substitutions? For the first question,
we divided amino-acid residues into 30 categories based on their predicted value of intrinsic disorder.
We report a significant positive correlation with w, 𝜔' and 𝜔&' with residue intrinsic disorder for both
species (w: Kendall’s t = 0.977, p = 3.39e-14 in A. thaliana; t = 0.954, p = 1.32e-13 in D. melanogaster;
𝜔&' : t = 0.917, p = 1.09e-12 in A. thaliana; t = 0.670, p = 2.08e-07 in D. melanogaster; 𝜔' : t = 0.60,
p = 3.22e-06 in A. thaliana; t = 0.706, p = 4.32e-08 in D. melanogaster; Figure 2b and supplementary
File S2). For the second question, proteins were categorized according to their proportion of disordered
residues (see Material and Methods). Analyses were performed with 30 categories. Results exhibit a
significant positive correlation of protein disorder with w in both species, 𝜔&' in A. thaliana and 𝜔' in
D. melanogaster (w: Kendall’s t = 0.752, p = 5.41e-09 in A. thaliana; t = 0.568, p = 4.58e-04 in D.
melanogaster; 𝜔&' : t = 0.733, p = 1.26e-08 in A. thaliana; t = 0.063, p = 6.97e-01 in D. melanogaster;
𝜔' : t = 0.191, p = 1.38e-01 in A. thaliana; t = 0.726, p = 7.56e-06 in D. melanogaster; Figure S4). Our
findings propose that, at the residue level, intrinsically disordered regions are more likely to respond to
adaptation and are also under less selective constraint in both species. However, when considering the

whole protein, we observe that intrinsically disordered proteins have different effects between species.
In particular, they contribute to the relaxation of purifying selection in A. thaliana and to a higher rate
of adaptation in D. melanogaster. The reason for the difference between species is unclear and will
require further analyses.

Probability of Residue Intrinsic Disorder

Figure 2. Relationship between w, 𝜔&' and 𝜔' with (a) the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and (b) the
probability of residue intrinsic disorder for A. thaliana (top) and D. melanogaster (bottom). The x axis is scaled
using a squared root function. Mean values of each estimate for each category are represented with connected
black dots. The shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval of each category, computed over 100 bootstrap
replicates.

Finally, we tested whether the rate of adaptive substitutions is affected by the binding affinity
of proteins to molecular chaperones. It has been suggested that binding to a chaperone leads to a higher
evolutionary rate due to the buffering effect for slightly deleterious mutations (Bogumil and Dagan
2010; Kadibalban et al. 2016). Here, we investigate whether binding to the chaperone DnaK could also
favour the fixation of adaptive mutations. In agreement with previous studies, we find an effect on w
(pairwise comparisons; p = 0.0109 in A. thaliana; p = 0.0172 in D. melanogaster; Figure S5) and 𝜔&'
in D. melanogaster (pairwise comparisons; p = 0.3152 in A. thaliana; p = 0.0172 in D. melanogaster;
Figure S5), but no effect on 𝜔' (pairwise comparisons; p > 0.670, FigureS5 and supplementary File S3),
suggesting that the interaction with a molecular chaperone does not influence the fixation of beneficial
mutations.
Protein function and adaptive evolution
We further explored the impact of protein function on sequence evolution. To do so, we analysed the
effect of gene expression, protein location and protein functional class on the rate of adaptive
substitutions. Several studies on both Eukaryote (Pal et al. 2001; Subramanian and Kumar 2004; Wright

highly expressed genes have lower rates of protein sequence evolution. Here we investigated if the lower
evolutionary rate is followed by a reduced rate of adaptive substitutions. To do so, we divided genes
into 30 and 15 categories for A. thaliana and D. melanogaster respectively. Our results support previous
findings by displaying a significant negative correlation of mean gene expression with estimates of w
and 𝜔&' in both species (w: Kendall’s t = -0.894, p = 3.92e-12 in A. thaliana; t = -0.771, p = 6.11e-05
in D. melanogaster; 𝜔&' : t = -0.816, p = 2.39e-10 in A. thaliana; t = -0.619, p = 1.30e-03 in D.
melanogaster; Figure 3). Besides, we find that mean gene expression is also significantly negatively
correlated with 𝜔' in D. melanogaster (Kendall’s t = -0.159, p = 0.2183 in A. thaliana; t = -0.505, p =
8.72e-03 in D. melanogaster; Figure 3 and supplementary File S2), suggesting that gene expression also
constrains the rate of adaptation, in addition to the well-known effect on purifying selection. It has been
hypothesized that the higher selective constraint in highly expressed genes could be driven by the
reduced probability of protein misfolding, wherein selection acts by favouring protein sequences that
accumulate less translational missense errors (Drummond et al. 2005). Hence, the higher selective
pressure to increase stability in highly expressed proteins could also be hampering the fixation of
adaptive mutations.

evolution in nuclear and secreted proteins, with the lowest values observed in the mitochondria, plasma
membrane and endomembrane system (pairwise comparisons; p = 0.0128 in A. thaliana; p = 0.0104 in
D. melanogaster; Figure S6). However, this result seems to be explained by a reduced purifying
selection, with significantly higher values of 𝜔&' observed in cytoplasmic, nuclear and secreted proteins
(pairwise comparisons; p = 0.0128 in A. thaliana; p > 0.0729 in D. melanogaster; Figure S6), and not
by a higher rate of adaptive substitutions, since no significant differences were found between the
categories in the estimates of 𝜔' (Figure S6 and supplementary File S3).
By analyzing the different categories of protein functional class (Tables S2 and S3 in
supplementary File S1), we observe that genes involved in protein biosynthesis (i.e. ribosome biogenesis
and transcription machinery) and signaling for protein degradation (ubiquitin system) exhibit the highest
rates of adaptive substitutions (Figure 4 and supplementary File S4), functions coded mostly by nuclear
and cytoplasmic proteins. Signal transduction pathways also appear to play a role in adaptation, since
protein phosphatases also present high rates of adaptive mutations (Hunter 1995). Moreover, in A.
thaliana, cytochrome P450 proteins are also in the top categories of 𝜔' (Figure 4 and supplementary
File S4). We fitted a linear model to the 𝜔' values of the shared categories (21 categories in total) to see
if results were consistent between the two species and found a positive correlation (Kendall’s t = 0.257,
p = 0.1101; Figure S7a), which is stronger after discarding the two outliers, mRNA biogenesis and
glycosyltransferases (Kendall’s t = 0.333, p = 0.0490; Figure S7b). Our findings therefore suggest that
adaptive mutations occur mainly through processes of protein regulation and signaling pathways.

What are the major drivers of adaptive evolution along the genome?
Overall, we found multiple factors influencing protein adaptive evolution, specifically recombination
rate (positive correlation), protein length (negative correlation), secondary structural motif (lower values
observed for b-sheets), relative solvent accessibility (positive correlation), protein intrinsic disorder
(positive correlation), gene expression levels (negative correlation) and protein functional class. Since
some of these variables are intrinsically correlated we next asked whether some of the inferred effects
are spurious. First of all, it is known that protein length and gene expression are negatively correlated,
wherein highly expressed genes tend to be shorter, as previously reported for vertebrates (Subramanian
and Kumar 2004), yeast (Coghlan and Wolfe 2000; Akashi 2003) and observed in this study (Kendall’s
t = -0.015, p = 1.22e-02 in A. thaliana; t = -0.093, p = 1.70e-28 in D. melanogaster; Figure S8). Since
highly expressed genes have lower rates of adaptive substitutions and shorter genes have higher rates of
adaptive evolution, we may conclude that these two variables independently impact the rate of
adaptation in proteins. Protein length is also negatively correlated with the proportion of exposed
residues (Kendall’s t = -0.310, p = 0.00 in A. thaliana; t = -0.404, p = 1.03e-223 in D. melanogaster;
Figure S9), as the surface / volume ratio of globular proteins decrease when protein length increases
(Janin 1979). By estimating the rate of adaptive mutations of buried and exposed sites separately, we
observe that the effect of protein length is no longer significant (𝜔' -buried: Kendall’s t = -0.422, p =
0.0892 in A. thaliana; t = -0.067, p = 0.7884 in D. melanogaster; 𝜔' -exposed: t = -0.289, p = 0.2449
in A. thaliana; t = 0.333, p = 0.1797 in D. melanogaster; Figure 5a and supplementary File S5). This
suggests that the effect of protein length on the rate of adaptive substitutions is a by-product of the effect
of the residue’s solvent exposure. Furthermore, mean gene expression is positively correlated with
solvent exposure (Kendall’s t = 0.016, p = 0.1037 in A. thaliana; t = 0.327, p = 4.50e-45 in D.
melanogaster; Figure S10), as expected since highly expressed genes are shorter and shorter genes have
a greater proportion of exposed residues (Figures S8 and S9). These two variables, however, have
opposite effects on 𝜔' , and we therefore conclude that gene expression is acting independently from
solvent exposure on the rate of adaptive protein evolution.
We further note that the secondary structure motif is intrinsically correlated with the degree of
intrinsic disorder, where loops and turns represent the most flexible motifs (Figure S11), consistent with
previous studies (Choi et al. 2006). When analysing different degrees of protein disorder across the
structural motifs, we observe that secondary structure has only an impact on estimates of w, while
intrinsic protein disorder is significantly positively correlated with w within the three motifs in both
species, and 𝜔' within b-sheets in A. thaliana and within a-helices in D. melanogaster (Figure S12 and
supplementary File S5). Moreover, we report that the secondary structure motif is correlated with
solvent exposure (Figure S13), b-sheets being mostly found at the core of proteins, while a-helices and
loops have, on average, higher solvent exposure (Bowie et al. 1990; Guo et al. 2004). By estimating the
rate of adaptive substitutions in buried and exposed residues across the three motifs, the impact of
secondary structure is no longer noticeable on estimates of 𝜔' (p > 0.1562; Figure S14 and

supplementary File S5), thus suggesting that the effect of secondary structure motif is also a by-product
of solvent exposure. When looking at the tertiary structure level, in agreement with Choi et al. (2006),
we report that structures with more exposed residues tend to be more flexible (Kendall’s t = 0.001, p =
0.5115 in A. thaliana; t = 0.015, p = 0.0222 in D. melanogaster; Figure S15). Estimation of the rate of
adaptive mutations in buried and exposed sites across different levels of residue intrinsic disorder shows
that solvent exposure plays the main role in protein adaptive evolution, with significant impact of protein
disorder only observed in values of w in both species and 𝜔' in exposed residues for D. melanogaster
(w-buried: Kendall’s t = 0.453, p = 5.27e-03 in A. thaliana; t = 0.505, p = 1.84e-03 in D. melanogaster;
w-exposed: t = 0.368, p = 2.31e-02 in A. thaliana; t = 0.716, p = 1.02e-05 in D. melanogaster; 𝜔&' buried: t = -0.063, p = 6.97e-01 in A. thaliana; t = 0.295, p = 6.92e-02 in D. melanogaster; 𝜔&' exposed: t = -0.0211, p = 8.97e-01 in A. thaliana; t = -0.032, p = 8.45e-01 in D. melanogaster; 𝜔' buried: t = 0.211, p = 1.94e-01 in A. thaliana; t = 0.084, p = 6.03e-01 in D. melanogaster; 𝜔' -exposed:
t = 0.211, p = 1.94e-01 in A. thaliana; t = 0.537, p = 9.35e-04 in D. melanogaster; Figure 5b and
supplementary File S5). These findings suggest that the level of exposure of a residue in the protein
structure is the main driver of adaptive evolution, and that structural flexibility potentially constitutes a
comparatively small, if any, effect to protein adaptation. By comparing the level of exposure of the
residues across the different classes of protein function, no differences are observed (Figure S16), thus
suggesting that these two variables independently affect the rate of protein adaptation.

Summarizing, our results reveal that besides population genetic processes such as recombination
and mutation rate (Marais and Charlesworth 2003; Hill and Robertson 2008; Castellano et al. 2016),
three major functional factors significantly impact the rate of protein adaptive evolution: gene
expression, relative solvent accessibility and the protein functional class. When looking at the magnitude
effect of each of these variables, we observe that exposed residues have a ten-fold higher rate of adaptive
substitutions when compared to completely buried sites (Figure 2a and supplementary File S2). The
effect of gene expression seems to be of lower magnitude, wherein less expressed genes have a two-fold
higher rate of adaptive substitutions with a significant negative correlation observed only in D.
melanogaster (Figure 3 and supplementary File S2). As a comparison, genes in highly recombining
regions have up to a ten-fold higher rate of adaptive substitutions compared to genes within regions with
the lowest recombination rates (Figure S1 and supplementary File S2), being therefore similar to that
observed with solvent exposure. Previous studies reported that the type of amino-acid change also plays
an important role in protein adaptive evolution, where more similar amino-acids present higher rates of
adaptive substitutions (Grantham 1974; Miyata et al. 1979; Bergman and Eyre-Walker, personal
communication). In order to evaluate a potential bias on the type of amino-acid at the surface and at the
core of proteins, we computed the proportion of conservative and radical residue changes, according to
volume and polarity indices, as defined by Grantham (Grantham 1974). We found similar frequencies
of conserved and radical changes in buried and exposed residues, thus suggesting that our results at the
structural level are not influenced by the type of amino-acid mutation (97% of conservative and 3%
changes on buried residues; 96% of conservative and 4% changes on exposed sites). Our findings
therefore suggest that protein architecture strongly influences the rate of adaptive protein evolution,
wherein selection acts by favouring a greater accumulation of adaptive mutations at the surface of
proteins.
What drives protein adaptive evolution?
Our results show that solvent exposure is the functional factor with the highest impact on the rate of
adaptive substitutions. To explain this effect, we discuss three hypotheses in which protein adaptive
evolution occurs through (1) the acquisition of new biochemical activities at the surface of proteins, (2)
the emergence of new functions via network rewiring at the level of protein-protein interactions, and (3)
inter-molecule interactions between organisms, as a consequence of host-pathogen coevolution.
We first hypothesized that protein adaptation results from new catalytic activities, wherein
adaptive mutations arise within active sites. Barlett et al (2002) reported that active sites are mostly
present in more intrinsically disordered regions of the protein. Moreover, they proposed that apoenzymes, which are not yet bound to the substrate or cofactor, present a greater residue flexibility and
more exposed catalytic residues, which could favour a higher rate of adaptive substitutions. In order to
test this, we estimated the rate of adaptive substitutions on active and non-active sites, controlling for
solvent exposure, and observed only significant differences in w within buried residues in A. thaliana

(p = 0.0309; all other estimates with p > 0.1122; Figure S17 and supplementary File S5), although with
higher values observed for non-active sites. While the non-significant differences in the rate of adaptive
mutations could result from incomplete annotations, which tend to be biased towards motifs highly
conserved across species (De Castro et al. 2006), this suggests that being present in an active site does
not influence the rate of adaptation. Active sites, however, are rather mobile, presenting different levels
of solvent exposure and residue flexibility according to the stage of the enzymatic reaction (Bartlett et
al. 2002). Therefore, it may be arbitrary to assign them a certain solvent exposure class based on the
phase the enzymes were crystallized, limiting our capacity to test their role on adaptive evolution.
Several studies discussed the impact of protein-protein interactions (PPI) on the rate of protein
evolution. Valdar and Thornton (2001) and Caffrey (2004) proposed that PPI may be acting as an
inhibitor of protein evolution by enhancing the efficiency of purifying selection due to a higher degree
of protein connectivity, typically associated with more complex functions. Mintseris and Weng (2005)
supported this assumption but proposed that the proteins evolving slowly are the ones involved in
obligate interactions, while proteins involved in transient interactions evolve at faster rates due to a
higher interface plasticity. Here, we ask whether the higher rate of adaptive mutations at the surface of
proteins could have arisen through inter-molecular interactions at the protein network level. We
addressed this question by estimating the rate of adaptive mutations in genes with different degrees of
PPI. This was only possible in D. melanogaster since there was no data available for A. thaliana. We
report a negative correlation between the number of PPI and w, 𝜔&' and 𝜔' , respectively, with only
significant values observed for w (w: Kendall’s t = -0.368, p = 0.0275; 𝜔&' : t = -0.111, p = 0.5062; 𝜔' :
t = -0.309, p = 0.0637; Figure S18 and supplementary File S2). These findings suggest that a higher
degree of protein connectivity leads to lower rates of protein sequence evolution, but prevent us to assess
with confidence whether this effect is due to a stronger purifying selection and/or a slower rate of
adaptive substitutions. A potential limitation of this analysis is the low number of genes with PPI
information available and the noise associated with the BioGRID annotations. As a physical interaction
does not necessarily imply a functional link, we might lack statistical power to detect any putative effect
of PPI on 𝜔' (Chatr-Aryamontri et al. 2017).
In support to our third hypothesis, several studies have described the role of the immune and
defense responses in molecular evolution across taxa (Sackton et al. 2007; Obbard et al. 2009; Enard et
al. 2016; Mauch-Mani et al. 2017). These studies suggest that pathogens could be key drivers of protein
adaptation, by acting as a powerful selective pressure through the coevolutionary arms race between
hosts and parasites. This could be driving the higher rate of adaptive mutations in protein biosynthesis
enzymes (Figure 4), which are the ones typically hijacked by pathogens during host infection (Dangl
and Jones 2001; Enard et al. 2016). Moreover, one of the fastest evolving protein class is the ubiquitin
system (Figure 4), which is known to be involved in the defense mechanism, both by the host, through
processes like the activation of innate immune responses and degradation signaling of pathogenic
proteins; and by the pathogen, which inhibits and/or uses this system in order to modulate host responses

(Loureiro and Ploegh 2006; Collins and Brown 2010; Dielen et al. 2010; Trujillo and Shirasu 2010;
Hiroshi et al. 2014). Likewise, in A. thaliana, cytochrome P450 proteins present a high rate of adaptive
mutations (Figure 4), which have been reported to play a crucial role in the defence response in plants
(Schuler and Werck-Reichhart 2003). Besides, the reduced selective pressure on nuclear and secreted
proteins (Figure S6) may be also a consequence of their role in disease and pathogen immunity (i.e.
Motion et al. 2015; Mosmann et al. 2016), as observed in yeast (Julenius and Pedersen 2006), insects
(Sackton et al. 2007; Obbard et al. 2009) and primates (Nielsen et al. 2005).
Our findings therefore support the hypothesis that coevolutionary arms race of the hostpathogen interactions are a major driver of adaptation in proteins. While we do not rule out that proteinprotein interactions and the acquisition of new biochemical functions could also have an impact, more
and better annotation data is required to further evaluate their role. In conclusion, our study reveals that,
in addition to genome architecture, protein structure has a substantial impact on adaptive evolution
consistent between D. melanogaster and A. thaliana, unraveling the potential generality of such effect.
Our study further emphasizes that the rate of adaptation not only varies substantially between genes, but
also at the intra-genic scale, and we posit that accounting for a fine-scale, intra-molecular evolution is
necessary to fully understand the patterns of molecular adaptation at the species level.

Population Genomic Data and Data filtering
The D. melanogaster data set included alignments of 114 genomes for one chromosome arm of the two
large autosomes (2L, 2R, 3L and 3R) and one sex chromosome (X) pooled from 22 sub-Saharan
populations with negligible amount of population structure (𝐹$3 = 0.05; DPGP2, Pool et al. 2012).

Coding DNA sequences (CDS) were extracted from the alignments with MafFilter (Dutheil et al. 2014)

transcript, in cases of multiple transcripts per gene. At this stage, 12,801 and 27,072 genes, for D.
melanogaster and A. thaliana respectively, were kept for further analysis. CDS sequences were then
concatenated in order to obtain the full coding region per gene. For the analysis with A. thaliana, the
alignment of A. lyrata with the reference sequence was re-aligned with each gene alignment of the
ingroup using MAFFT v7.38 (Katoh and Standley 2013) with the options add and keeplength so that no
gaps were included in the ingroup. Genes with incomplete CDS sequences due to missing information
in the outgroup were kept to increase the number of sites for the analysis and gaps were discarded. CDS
alignments with premature stop codons were excluded. Final datasets included 10,318 genes for D.
melanogaster/D. simulans and 18,669 genes for A. thaliana/A. lyrata. These datasets were then used to
infer both the synonymous and non-synonymous unfolded and folded site frequency spectra (SFS), and
synonymous and non-synonymous divergence based on the rate of synonymous and non-synonymous
substitutions. All calculations were performed using the BppPopStats program from the Bio++ Program
Suite (Guéguen et al. 2013). The Grapes program was then used to compute a genome-wide estimate of
the rate of non-adaptive (𝜔&' ) and adaptive non-synonymous substitutions (𝜔' ) (Galtier 2016). This
method assumes that all sites were sampled in the same number of chromosomes and since some sites
were not successfully sampled in all individuals, the original dataset was reduced to 110 and 105
individuals for D. melanogaster and A. thaliana respectively, by randomly down-sampling polymorphic
alleles at each site. The following models were fitted and compared using Akaike’s information
criterion: Neutral, Gamma, Gamma-Exponential, Displaced Gamma, Scaled Beta and Bessel K. A
model selection procedure was conducted on the two datasets using the complete set of genes for
comparison (see Table S1 in supplementary File S1). Following analyses comprised the categorization
of genes (see Tables S2 and S3 in supplementary File S1 for detailed information on the genes used for
each variable as well as the population genetic parameters estimated per gene for A. thaliana and D.
melanogaster respectively) and amino-acid residues (see Tables S4 and S5 in supplementary File S1 for
detailed information on the amino-acid residues used for each category as well as the population genetic
parameters estimated per site for A. thaliana and D. melanogaster respectively) for the different
variables analysed and are described below.
Categorization of gene and genome architecture
Recombination rates were obtained with the R package “MareyMap” (Rezvoy et al. 2007), by using the
cubic splines interpolation method. Hereafter we computed the mean recombination rate in cM/Mb units
for each gene. Discretization of the observed distribution of recombination rate was performed in 50
and 30 categories with around 350 and 280 genes each for D. melanogaster and A. thaliana respectively.
Intronic information was obtained using the GenomeTools from a GFF with exon annotation and the
option addintrons (Gremme et al. 2013). Genes were discretized into 10 and 13 categories according to

Categorization of protein structure
Genes were discretized according to the total size of the coding region, for which 50 and 30 categories
with around 650 and 350 genes each were made for D. melanogaster and A. thaliana respectively.
In order to obtain structural information for each protein sequence, blastp (Schaffer 2001) was
first used to assign each protein sequence to a PDB structure by using the “pdbaa” library and an e-value
threshold of 1e-10, allowing only one match per protein sequence. This resulted in 5,008 genes for which
a PDB structure was available, making a total of 3,834 PDB structures for D. melanogaster and 9,121
genes with a total of 3,832 PDB structures for A. thaliana. The corresponding PDB structures were then
downloaded and further processed to only keep one chain per polymer. PDB manipulation and analysis
were carried on using the R package “bio3d” (Grant et al. 2006). Values for secondary structure (SS)
and solvent accessibility (SA) per residue were obtained using the “dssp” program with default options,
and were successfully retrieved for 3,613 PDB files corresponding to 4,944 genes for D. melanogaster
and 3,806 PDB files for a total of 9,106 genes for A. thaliana. Subsequently, to map SS and SA values
to each residue of the protein sequence a pairwise alignment between each protein and the respective
PDB sequence was performed with MAFFT, allowing gaps in both sequences in order to increase the
block size of sites aligned. The final data set comprised a total of 1,397,885 sites with SS and SA
information, out of 4,821,113 total codon sites obtained with BppPopStats for the complete set of genes
of D. melanogaster, and 2,585,468 sites mapped with SS and SA information out of 7,479,808 codon
sites of A. thaliana. We computed the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) by dividing SA by the aminoacid’s solvent accessible area (Tien et al. 2013).
Categorization of secondary structure was performed by comparing 460,702, 975,934 and
523,880 amino-acid residues in b-sheets, a-helices and loops respectively in A. thaliana, and 258,898,
516,356 and 282,588 sites in b-sheets, a-helices and loops respectively in D. melanogaster. RSA values
were analysed with 28 categories with around 85,000 sites each, with the exception of the totally buried
residues (RSA = 0) category containing 299,684 sites in A. thaliana; and 19 categories with
approximately 69,000 residues each, except for 151,417 completely buried residues in D. melanogaster.
For the analysis of correlation between variables two categories of RSA were considered, comparing
buried (RSA < 0.05) and exposed (RSA >= 0.05) residues, following Miller et al (Miller et al. 1987).
Estimates of intrinsic protein disorder were acquired via the software DisEMBL (Linding et al.
2003), wherein intrinsic disorder was estimated per site and classified according to the degree of “hot
loops”, meaning loops with a high degree of mobility. This analysis was successfully achieved for a
total of 7,479,807 out of 7,479,808 sites for A. thaliana and 3,952,602 out of 4,821,113 sites for D.
melanogaster. Amino-acid residues were divided into 30 categories with an average of 249,000 and
131,000 sites in A. thaliana and D. melanogaster respectively. For the proportion of disordered regions
per protein, we considered a residue “disordered” if it was in the top 25% of the measured probabilities
of disorder across the proteomes of each species. Analyses were performed with 30 categories with
around 620 and 420 genes for A. thaliana and D. melanogaster respectively.

Identification of proteins binding to a molecular chaperone
Prediction of the molecular chaperone DnaK binding sites in the protein sequence was estimated with
the LIMBO software using the default option Best overall prediction. This setting implies 99%
specificity and 77.2% sensitivity (Van Durme et al. 2009). Genes were categorized according to this
prediction setting, which suggests that every peptide scoring above 11.08 is a predicted DnaK binder.
Genes scoring below that value were not consider as possible binders.
Categorization of gene expression
Gene expression data was obtained from the database Expression Atlas (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa;
Petryszak et al. 2016), wherein one baseline experiment was used for each species (D. melanogaster, EMTAB-4723; A. thaliana, E-GEOD-53197). For both analysis, gene expression levels were averaged
across samples and tissues for each gene, ending up with 15 and 30 categories with around 430 and 350
genes each for A. thaliana and D. melanogaster respectively.
Protein cellular localization and protein functional class
Cellular localization of each protein sequence was predicted with the software ProtComp (from
Softberry, http://www.softberry.com/) with the default options and genes were classified into the
following cellular categories: cytoplasmic, endomembrane system, mitochondrial, nuclear, peroxisome,
plasma membrane and secreted proteins. The category peroxisome was excluded from further analysis
due to the small number of annotated genes (114 and 250 genes in D. melanogaster and A. thaliana
respectively; detailed information in Tables S2 and S3 in supplementary File S1). Protein functional
classes were obtained with the Bioconductor package for R “KEGGREST”, using the KEGG BRITE
database (Kanehisa et al. 2002). Analysis were carried out with 2,950 and 3,780 genes for D.
melanogaster and A. thaliana respectively, discretized into the highest levels of each of the three top
categories of protein classification: metabolism, genetic information processing and signalling and
cellular processes (see Tables S2 and S3 in supplementary File S1).
Enzymatic active sites and protein-protein interactions
In order to check whether a residue was present in an active site, we used the ScanProsite software (De
Castro et al. 2006). Datasets included 1,061,876 and 1,870,166 active sites for D. melanogaster and A.
thaliana respectively. All sites that were not predicted by the program were considered as non-active
(see Tables S4 and S5 in supplementary File S1). Data on the degree of protein-protein interactions was
obtained with the BioGRID database (Chatr-Aryamontri et al. 2017). This was only possible for D.
melanogaster since there was no corresponding data available for A. thaliana. Analyses were carried
out with 5,630 genes divided into 19 categories, with 1,114 genes in the first category, and the others

ranging from 700 to 130 according to the respective number of interactions (see Tables S2 and S3 in
supplementary File S1).
Estimation of the adaptive and non-adaptive rate of non-synonymous substitutions
For all gene and amino-acid sets, 100 bootstrap replicates were generated by randomly sampling genes
or sites in each category. The Grapes program was then run on each category and replicate with the
Gamma-Exponential distribution of fitness effects (Galtier 2016). The first step included the removal of
replicates for which the distribution of fitness effects parameters was not successfully fitted. For this
purpose, we discarded 1% in the maximum and minimum values for the mean and shape parameters of
the DFE (see supplementary files for detailed R scripts). Results for w, 𝜔&' and 𝜔' were plotted using
the R package “ggplot2” (Wickham 2017) (see supplementary files).
Statistical analyses
Significance for all continuous variables, including protein length, number of introns, gene expression,
intrinsic residue disorder, proportion of disordered regions, recombination rate, number of proteinprotein interactions and RSA, was assessed through Kendall’s correlation tests. For this, the mean value
of the 100 bootstrap replicates was taken for each category (see detailed script as well as all statistical
results in supplementary File S2; note: p-values indicated as 0 in this file correspond to a p < 1.0e-8).
Significance values for discrete variables, comprising binding affinity to DnaK, protein location, protein
functional class and secondary structure motif, were achieved by estimating the differences between
each pair of the categories analysed, by randomly subtracting each bootstrap replicate. Following steps
included counting the number of times the differences between categories were below and above 0,
which by taking the minimum of those values gives us a statistic that we call k. The two-tailed p was
then estimated by applying the following equation: p = (2k + 1)/(N + 1), where N in the number of
bootstrap replicates used. For variables comparing more than two categories we corrected the p for
multiple testing using the FDR method (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) as implemented in R (R Core
Team 2015) (see detailed script and all statistical results in supplementary Files S3 and S4). Analyses
on the correlations between variables are described in supplementary Files S5 and S6.
