Abstract

9

The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place in the plant chloroplast thylakoid

10

membrane, a complex three-dimensional structure divided into the stacked grana and

11

unstacked stromal lamellae domains. Plants regulate the macro-organization of

12

photosynthetic complexes within the thylakoid membrane to adapt to changing environmental

13

conditions and avoid oxidative stress. One such mechanism is the state transition which

14

regulates photosynthetic light harvesting and electron transfer. State transitions are driven by

15

changes in the phosphorylation of light harvesting antenna complex II (LHCII), which cause

16

a decrease in grana diameter and stacking, a decreased energetic connectivity between

17

photosystem II (PSII) reaction centres and an increase in the relative LHCII antenna size of

18

photosystem I (PSI) compared to PSII. Phosphorylation is believed to drive these changes by

19

weakening the intra-membrane lateral PSII-LHCII and LHCII-LHCII interactions and the

20

inter-membrane stacking interactions between these complexes, while simultaneously

21

increasing the affinity of LHCII for PSI. We investigated the relative roles and contributions

22

of these three types of interaction to state transitions using a lattice-based model of the

23

thylakoid membrane based on existing structural data, developing a novel algorithm to

24

simulate protein complex dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that state transitions

25

are unlikely to lead to a large-scale migration of LHCII from the grana to the stromal

26

lamellae. Instead, the increased light harvesting capacity of PSI is largely due to the more

27

efficient recruitment of LHCII already residing in the stromal lamellae into PSI-LHCII

28

supercomplexes upon its phosphorylation. Likewise, the increased light harvesting capacity

29

of PSII upon dephosphorylation was found to be driven by a more efficient recruitment of

30

LHCII already residing in the grana into functional PSII-LHCII clusters, primarily driven by

31

lateral interactions.

Statement of significance

35

For photosynthesis to operate at maximum efficiency the activity of the light-driven

36

chlorophyll-protein complexes, photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII) must be fine-tuned to

37

environmental conditions. Plants achieve this balance through a regulatory mechanism

38

known as the state transition, which modulates the relative light-harvesting antenna size and

39

therefore excitation rate of each photosystem. State transitions are driven by changes in the

40

extent of the phosphorylation of light harvesting complex II (LHCII), which modulate the

41

interactions between PSI, PSII and LHCII. Here we developed a novel algorithm to simulate

42

protein complex dynamics and then ran Monte Carlo simulations to understand how these

43

interactions cooperate to affect the organization of the photosynthetic membrane and bring

44

about state transitions.

Introduction

47

The plant chloroplast thylakoid membrane is the site of the light reactions of photosynthesis.

48

Here, the integral membrane protein complexes; light-harvesting complex II (LHCII),

49

photosystem II (PSII), cytochrome b6f (cytb6f), photosystem I (PSI) and ATP synthase carry

50

out light harvesting and electron and proton transport, culminating in the synthesis of

51

NADPH and ATP, which are utilized in the stroma for CO2 fixation. The thylakoid membrane

52

is partitioned into the grana and stromal lamellae regions (1–3). The grana are cylindrical

53

stacks of 2-30 appressed membranes 400-500 nm in diameter, enriched in LHCII and PSII.

54

The stromal lamellae are flat sheet like structures that wrap helically around the grana

55

interconnecting one stack to another and are enriched in PSI and ATP synthase (4–6). The

56

cytb6f complex is evenly distributed between the two domains (1, 7, 8). The division of the

57

thylakoid into the grana and stromal lamellae depends on the presence of positively charged

58

counterions to overcome the net negative charge on the membranes (9, 10). In the presence of

59

cations attractive lateral interactions between PSII and LHCII drive the lateral segregation of

60

these complexes from PSI and ATP synthase (10–12). In the presence of screening levels of

61

cations attractive van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions between the flat stromal

62

surfaces of these PSII-LHCII macrodomains then allow these complexes to self-associate

63

with PSII-LHCII regions in neighbouring membranes to form 3-dimensional grana stacks

64

(11, 13, 14). An entropic driving force through the influence of macromolecular crowding

65

may also contribute to grana stacking (15). At the molecular level, the interaction of two

66

LHCII trimers across the stromal gap has been calculated to be of the order 4 kBT where kB is

67

Boltzmann’s constant and T is the temperature in K (16).

68

The light environment of land plants fluctuates by orders of magnitude over time

69

scales as little as a second. Such dramatic variations can cause mismatches between the

70

amount of light absorbed and its utilisation in photosynthesis leading to metabolic and

71

oxidative stress that lowers plant growth and productivity (17, 18). Fortunately plants have

72

evolved a complex repertoire of mechanisms that can alter the efficiency of light harvesting

73

and electron transfer in the thylakoid membrane (19). One such mechanism is the state

74

transition which balances the relative excitation level of PSI and PSII to optimise

75

photosynthesis (20, 21). The relative excitation balance between PSI and PSII varies with

76

light spectral quality due to their differing absorption spectra and may also be adjusted to

77

account for differences in the required ratio of linear (PSII and PSI) to cyclic (PSI only)

78

photosynthetic electron transfer (22, 23). State transitions are regulated by the redox state of

79

the photosynthetic electron transfer chain (24). When PSII is overexcited relative to PSI, the

80

Qp site on the cytb6f complex is occupied by plastoquinol (PQH2) leading to activation of the

81

STN7 kinase (25). STN7 phosphorylates the stromal-facing N-terminus of the LHCII

82

subunits LHCB1 and 2, weakening its tendency to associate with PSII and increasing its

83

affinity for PSI (State II) (26). In this way the relative light harvesting antenna sizes of PSI

84

and PSII are altered to equalise their relative excitation rates restoring redox homeostasis of

85

the electron transfer chain. When PSI is overexcited relative to PSII the PQ pool is oxidised

86

and STN7 is inactivated and LHCII is dephosphorylated by the constitutively active

87

phosphatase TAP38 (State I) (27, 28). Alternatively State I can also induced by simultaneous

88

overreduction of the PQ pool and the chloroplast stroma in high light through the inhibitory

89

effect of thioredoxin (and /or ΔpH) on STN7 (29, 30).

90

While the LHCII phosphorylation is clearly established as the mechanistic basis of

91

state transitions it remains unclear precisely how the thylakoid macro-organization changes to

92

bring about the relative change in the PSI/ PSII antenna size. STN7-dependent

93

phosphorylation of LHCII causes a reduction in grana diameter and the number of membrane

94

layers per stack while simultaneously increasing the number of grana per chloroplast (23, 31).

95

Puthiyaveetil et al. (14) calculated, by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for average

96

surface charge across the grana, the changes in the stacking forces due to LHCII

97

phosphorylation. They found that at physiologically relevant cation concentrations the

98

balance between attractive van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions and repulsive

99

electrostatic interactions is carefully poised. The net result is that increasing the negative

100

surface charge density on LHCII by phosphorylation is sufficient to weaken the lateral and

101

stacking interactions that sustain grana organization (13, 14). These changes bring about a

102

reduction in grana dimeter and effectively increase the contact area between the grana and

103

stromal lamellae, which may facilitate the exchange of LHCII between the domains (23, 31,

104

32). The changes in thylakoid stacking were also found to weaken the connectivity between

105

PSII reaction centres, again contributing to the relative shift in antenna size (33). In addition

106

to LHCII phosphorylation, molecular recognition through the presence of specific binding

107

sites on PSI is also important (20, 34). Binding of Phospho-LHCII (P-LHCII) to PSI via the

108

PsaL/ O and H subunits gives rise to the PSI-LHCII supercomplex for which a high

109

resolution structural model has been solved (35, 36). A second probably weaker binding site

110

for P-LHCII involving the LHCI (LHCA1-4) subunits of PSI also exists (37, 38). The psal

111

and lhca mutants of Arabidopsis thus largely lack state transitions despite unchanged or even

112

increased levels of LHCII phosphorylation (34, 37). Early structural analysis using freeze-

113

fracture electron microscopy revealed that LHCII migrates from the grana to stromal lamellae

114

upon transition to State II in isolated thylakoids, consistent with a decrease in the chlorophyll

115

a/b ratio of this domain (39). However, later biochemical studies where state transitions were

116

first induced in leaves prior to thylakoid isolation and those using in situ fluorescence

117

microscopy suggested PSI and LHCII encountered one another in the margins where the two

118

domains meet and exchange of LHCII between domains was very limited (40, 41). However,

119

recent cryo-electron tomography data has cast doubt on the existence of a defined margins

120

region with intermediate composition relative to the grana and stromal lamellae (8).

121

Moreover, it is now clear that a population of LHCII energetically connected to PSI resides in

122

the stromal lamellae even in State I and that the transition to State II rather increases the

123

proportion (42). The relative importance of the changes in thylakoid membrane stacking and

124

changes in the lateral interactions brought about by LHCII phosphorylation remain unclear

125

and indeed they may fulfil distinct as well as complimentary roles in regulating electron a

126

transfer and light harvesting

127

Given the unanswered questions that remain on the precise mechanism of state

128

transitions new approaches are needed to clarify how the altered balance of forces upon

129

LHCII phosphorylation affect the thylakoid macro-organization. The structural model of the

130

thylakoid membrane at the individual protein complex level presented here was made

131

possible by recent breakthroughs in elucidating thylakoid organization and dynamics using in

132

atomic force microscopy (AFM) (7, 23, 43) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM)

133

(31, 44), and publication of high-resolution structures of the key protein complexes involved

134

in the light reactions (45–50). Recently developed algorithms, which made the calculation of

135

whether two or more particles spatially overlap tractable, were also essential (see methods).

136

Thanks to these advances, we were able to model the behaviour of protein complexes using

137

structures obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank whereas previous studies relied on

138

simplified protein geometries (16, 51). Previous models have revealed that relatively weak (2

139

KBT) interaction between LHCII trimers, including strong and moderately bound trimers of

140

the PSII-LHCII supercomplex, give rise to complex emergent behaviour including the

141

formation of crystalline domains of PSII and LHCII (51, 52). This model extends those of

142

Schneider and Geissler., (16) and Lee et al., (51), to include cytb6f, PSI and ATP synthase as

143

well as introducing separate thylakoid regions: the grana and the stromal lamellae. We used

144

this molecular model as a basis for Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the role of specific

145

lateral intermolecular interactions and changes in grana stacking forces in modifying the

146

distribution of photosynthetic complexes between the two domains and on the connectivity of

147

LHCII with PSI and PSII. In particular, we address the question of whether the lateral and

148

stacking interactions have functionally distinct or cooperative roles in state transitions. In

149

order to achieve this, we developed a lattice-based algorithm for overlap detection of particles

150

of arbitrary geometry an area that remains an active area of research. This algorithm was

151

shown to be computational effective for a large number of protein complexes, rendering

152

feasible the mesoscale Monte Carlo simulation protein structures directly from the Protein

153

Data Bank.

166

and moderately PSII-bound) per PSII reaction centre (54). cytb6f particles were distributed

167

between the grana and stromal lamellae at a ratio of at an equal area density to a total of 0.5

168

times the number of PSII reaction centres (1, 7). The ATP synthase was added to the stromal

169

lamellae at a density of 0.7 of the number of PSII reaction centres (1, 55). Monomeric PSII

170

and free LHCII were added to the stromal lamellae at a density of 10 % and 30 % of the total

Monte Carlo simulations

177

LHCII lateral and stacking interactions were modelled using the potentials described in

178

Schneider and Geissler (16) except that intra-layer interactions were nonspecific: we did not

179

specify an angular difference threshold for binding. This is because specific interactions were

180

considered from the outset by including C2S2M2 and C2S2 PSII-LHCII supercomplexes in the

181

model in equal numbers. We note that the S and M LHCII trimers of C2S2M2 and C2S2 PSII-

182

LHCII are not directly involved in state transitions in vivo (56). We introduced a PSI-LHCII

183

interaction, based on Pan et al., (36), when LHCII was phosphorylated. This was modelled as

184

a square well interaction and varied between 2 and 16 kBT with a distance threshold of 1 nm.

185

Simulations included two grana layers of equal composition. Equilibrium properties of the

186

thylakoid membrane system were sampled using the standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

187

For each perturbation in the Monte Carlo simulations, a particle was selected at random from

188

one of the two layers, and moved by plus or minus 1 nm (lattice spacing) in x or y and rotated

189

by plus or minus π/33. 107 perturbations were made for each simulation and sampling was

190

only carried out when the system was in equilibrium (Supplementary Fig. 1). Overlap of

191

particles was forbidden during simulations. Spatial overlap was implied when the total

192

number of lattice sites occupied by all particles was less than the sum of the number of lattice

193

sites occupied by individual particles (Supplementary Fig. 2). A thorough discussion is given

194

in Appendix 1. Test simulations were performed with only LHCII complexes (Supplementary

195

Fig. 3) or with only LHCII and PSI complexes to test PSI-LHCII interactions.

Diffusion in protein complex dynamics

198

Translational (DT) and rotational (DR) diffusion coefficients of protein complexes in the

199

thylakoid membrane were calculated according to Saffman and Delbrück (57):

204

respectively, h = 4 nm is the thickness of the lipid bilayer, γ ≈ 0.577 is the Euler-Mascheroni

205

constant and re is the effective radius of the particle

re =

Par t icle ar ea (nm2 )
π

207

The effective radius therefore makes the simplifying assumption that the particle is circular.

208

In diffusion simulations, translations were ± 1 nm (in x and y directions) and rotations were ±

209

π/33 radians (π/33 radians was chosen because this results in movements to only

210

neighbouring lattice site for larger particles). A single time step of 1 μs was used. To

211

compensate for the variety of diffusion coefficients, we used a probabilistic approach

212

whereby translations and rotations where accepted given the following criteria:

213

214

1 ∆ X2
Accept t r a n sl at io n with pr o ba bilit y
1μs 4DT
Accept r o tat io n with pr o ba bilit y

1 ∆ θ2
1μs 4DR

215

That is, movements were accepted with a probability defined by the predicted time (from the

216

Einstein equation (∆ x 2 = 4D ∆ t)) divided by 1 μs. The 1 μs time step was chosen such that

217

the probability of acceptance was always less than 1. Translations and rotations were

218

considered independent.

219

Graphical analysis of antennae size and PSII connectivity

220

The PSII-LHCII chlorophyll antenna network was modelled as a graph network using the

221

NetworkX package in Python (Supplementary Fig. 4). Each PSII or LHCII complex was

222

represented by a node in the graph. Edges were introduced between any two nodes in the

223

graph if any chlorophyll in the particle represented by the first node was within a given

224

distance (referred to as the distance threshold) of any chlorophyll in the complex represented

225

by the other node (Supplementary Fig. 4). We measured two properties of the graph, termed

226

the antennae size and the PSII connectivity. The antenna size was defined as the average

227

number of LHCII, over all PSII complexes and at a given distance threshold, for which there

228

exists a connecting path (a sequence of edges connecting the two nodes). The PSII

229

connectivity was defined in terms of PSII clusters. If there existed a path between any two

230

PSII complexes, they were defined as belonging to the same cluster of PSII complexes. The

231

PSII connectivity was therefore defined as the average number of reaction centres per PSII

232

cluster.

The particles were regarded as “hard” objects, meaning that translations and rotations with

resulted in any two particles occupying the same lattice site were forbidden. To calculate

240

whether particle overlap had occurred during the movement of a given particle, we developed

the following algorithm (Supplementary Fig. 2)

Particle geometries, as determined from PDB structures, were represented by a matrix Pi of

dimension 2 x n. The columns of Pi contain the coordinates of lattice sites occupied by the

particle.

245

We define the matrix M as the concatenation of all Pi along the column axis, and is therefore

a matrix which contains, in its columns, the lattice sites occupied by all (m) particles

248

During a given time step, the ith particle may be translated by an amount ∆ X and rotated by

249

an amount ∆ θ, giving the new coordinates.

250

The new M is created after each particle translation or rotation.

251

Theorem 1.

252

We define the function Νunique(M) as the number of unique columns of M.

253

Pi spatially overlaps at least one other particle in M if and only if

254

Νu n iq u e(M ) < Νu n iq u e(Pi) + Νu n iq u e(M | Pi )

255

Where A|B (A but not B) refers to the set difference of the columns of A and B. Intuitively, if

256

the total number of occupied lattice sites is less than the number occupied by the particle of

257

interest plus the number occupied by all other particles (Figure 1A,B), then the particle of

258

interest must share a lattice site with another particle. Therefore, there is overlap of two or

259

more particles.

260

Proof.

261

As Νunique(M) is equivalent to the number of elements in the set of columns of M, or

262

Νu n iq u e(M) = | {Co l(M )} | , and because M contains the columns of Pi then

263

{Co l(Pi )} ⊂ {Co l(M )}

264

∀ x ∈ {Co l(M )}, x ∈ {Co l(Pi )} o r x ∈ {Co l(M | Pi )} o r x ∈ {Co l(Pi )} ∩ {Co l(M | Pi )}

265

And so

266
267
268

Νu n iq u e(M ) = Νu n iq u e(Pi) + Νu n iq u e(M | Pi) − Νu n iq u e({Co l(Pi )} ∩ {Co l(M | Pi )})

Hence
Νu n iq u e(M ) < Νu n iq u e(Pi) + Νu n iq u e(M | Pi )

269

implies that
ηu n iq u e({Co l(Pi )} ∩ {Co l(M | Pi )}) > 0

270
271

And so there exists at least one column (and therefore at least one occupied lattice site)

272

common to both Pi and M | Pi.

273
274

We use existing Python libraries to calculate Νunique. We found that we could significantly

275

reduce the time taken to compute Νunique if lattice sites were given a unique index, effectively

276

making the lattice geometry 1-D. We apply suitable scaling and offsetting of the lattice units

277

to ensure that x, y ∈ ℕ and define a suitable function f

f : M(2 × N ) → M(1 × N )

278
279

Such that the uniqueness of the columns of M is preserved. For 2 dimensions, we find a

280

suitable f in the form

f (M ) = CM

f (x, y) = c1 x + y

289
290

Where ∀x, y c1 > x, y

291

For x = 0, f (0,y) = y

292

This is unique for any y since

f (x, y + 1) = f (x, y) + 1 > f (x, y)

293
294

For 0 < x, we have f (x, y) = c1 x + y

295

Now y < c1 and so, for all y, f (x, y) = c1 x + y < c1 x + c1 = f (x + 1,0)

296

And so

f (x, y) < f (x, y + 1) < f (x + 1,0) < f (x + 1,y)

297
298

In summary, if f (0,0) is uniquely defined, then f (x, y) = c1 x + y is also uniquely defined if

299

c1 is greater than any given x or y in the geometry of the model.

304

The thylakoid model

305

A model of the plant thylakoid membrane was constructed, based on realistic protein

306

complex geometries and densities (Fig. 1A). The densities of PSII and PSI were obtained

307

from AFM images on isolated grana and stromal lamellae membranes from spinach (23). The

308

relative number of other complexes in the membrane (LHCII, cytb6f, ATP synthase) were

309

taken from the current literature, see methods. The model produced a number of predictions

310

that agreed with the experimental literature. The chlorophyll a/b ratio calculated to be 3.2 was

311

found to agree with those taken from spinach leaves grown at 150 µmol photons m-2 s-1

312

(Supplementary Fig. 5). In this model, the grana area, PSII density, PSI density and PSI: PSII

313

stoichiometry were fixed parameters based on experimental data. The number of PSII

314

complexes was calculated by multiplying the PSII density by the grana area. Because of the

315

fixed PSI:PSII ratio, this resulted in a fixed number of PSI complexes. The radius and

316

therefore the area of the stromal lamellae was calculated such that it resulted in the correct

317

PSI density. In this model we choose a 1:1 stoichiometry of PSI and PSII. This resulted in the

318

radius of the thylakoid including stromal lamellae to be 252 nm when the grana radius was

319

set at 190 nm (23) and predicted the area of grana as a percentage of total thylakoid area to be

320

54%. We found this prediction to be within the range of 50-80 % proposed in the literature

321

(59, 60). In general, we found that for any choice of PSI to PSII stoichiometry in the range of

322

0.5 to 1.2, the resulting area of grana as a percentage of total thylakoid was within the

323

observed range (Supplementary Fig. 6). This largely agrees with the range of PSI:PSII ratios

324

of 0.54 - 1.4 observed in the literature (61). We calculated the area occupation of each type of

325

complex in the membrane as the number of lattice sites occupied by the complexes divided

326

by the total number of lattice sites in the grana or stromal lamellae. The area fraction (the

327

fraction of lattice sites occupied) of protein complexes were 0.75 in the grana (Fig. 1B) and

328

0.67 in the stromal lamellae (Fig. 1C). The lower density of proteins in the stromal lamellae

329

compared to the grana was confirmed with AFM analysis of grana and stromal lamellae

330

membranes (Supplementary Fig. 7) and previous work (62). The overall protein area

331

occupation as a percentage within the thylakoid was 72%, in agreement with the previous

332

estimates of around 70 % (63). In particular, LHCII dominates the grana with free LHCII

333

trimers accounting for almost 40 % of the grana area (Fig. 1C). Including 4 LHCII timers

334

bound to each C2S2M2 PSII complex and 2 LHCII trimers bound to each C2S2 PSII complex,

335

increases the area occupation of LHCII to around 55 % of the grana area. The area of the

336

stromal lamellae was found to be predominantly occupied by PSI (Fig. 1D). At 40 %, the area

337

occupancy of PSI in the stromal lamellae was greater than that other every other protein

338

complex in the stromal lamellae combined, which was approximately 30 %.

339
340

State transitions change the molecular organization of the thylakoid membrane.

341

We investigated the phenomenon of state transitions at an individual complex level. In the

342

dephosphorylated State I (SI), LHCII trimers interact with one another both within the same

343

membrane via specific protein-protein interactions (hereafter lateral interactions) and across

344

the stromal gap of the grana via electrostatic interactions mediated by cation screening

345

(hereafter stacking interactions) (Fig. 2A). Both of these interactions are greatly diminished

346

when LHCII is phosphorylated in State II (SII) (13, 14). There is however, the appearance of

347

the PSI-LHCI-LHCII complex when LHCII is phosphorylated (Fig. 2B) (35). We modelled

348

SI using the lateral and stacking LHCII interactions described in Schneider & Geissler

349

(16)(Fig. 2A,C) and modelled SII by introducing a square well interaction between LHCII

350

and PSI (Fig. 2B,D). In both cases, only LHCII was allowed to move between the grana and

351

stromal lamellae, consistent with the majority of the biochemical data (31, 40, 42). The grana

352

radius was set to 190 nm and 170 nm for SI and SII respectively as observed in SIM images

353

of spinach chloroplasts (23). The densities of PSII and PSI were unchanged from SI to SII as

354

was the area of grana as a percentage of total thylakoid area (31, 56). The latter fact is

355

explained by the increased number of grana per chloroplast that offsets the decrease in grana

356

diameter in State II (31). Monte Carlo simulations were used to sample the partitioning of

357

LHCII into the grana and stromal lamellae at equilibrium. Sampling was carried out after 107

358

Monte Carlo perturbations for SI and SII (Supplementary Fig. 1).

359

We defined the presence of the PSI-LHCII complex by the criterion of LHCII in close

360

proximity (≤ 1 nm) to the PSI binding site described in Pan et al., (36). We observed an

361

increased in the fraction of PSI in complex with LHCII from 2.3 ± 0.6% at 0 KBT to 80% at

362

16 KBT in SII, within this range of values an interaction of 3.3 KBT reproduced a figure of 42

363

% of PSI in complex with LHCII in SII in line with experimental data (37, 64)(Fig. 3A). We

364

therefore chose 3.3 KBT as representative of the PSI-LHCII interaction in SII and hereafter

365

we will simply refer to this as SII. We found that the strength of the PSI-LHCII interaction

366

did not affect the amount percentage of LHCII partitioned into the stromal lamellae (Fig. 3B)

367

but transition from SI to SII was accompanied by an increase in proportion of LHCII

368

partitioned into the stromal lamellae by 27.5% to 29.0% (Fig. 3C). We found that the

369

migration of LHCII into the stromal lamellae did not directly result in an increased proportion

370

of PSI-LHCII complexes. This was evident due to the random state (no interactions) having

371

similar amount of LHCII in the stromal lamellae (Fig. 3C) but a much-decreased proportion

372

of PSI bound to LHCII (Fig. 3D). This result suggests that the amount of LHCII present in

373

the stromal lamellae is predominantly controlled by the strength of the lateral and stacking

374

interactions present in SI rather than the PSI-LHCII interaction, a finding which is consistent

375

with experimental data that shows the reduction in grana diameter and stacking in SII is not

376

dependent on specific PSI-LHCII interactions (31). This observation also suggested that the

377

formation of PSI-LHCII complexes in SII was not limited by LHCII migration from the

378

grana. To test this, we ran a separate SII simulation where LHCII was not permitted to

379

migrate between the grana and the stromal lamellae and found that the percentage of PSI

380

present as PSI-LHCII complexes was not significantly reduced (Fig. 3E). Thus, the

381

partitioning of LHCII between the grana and stromal lamellae did not account for the

382

magnitude of the increase in the number of PSI-LHCII supercomplexes as a fraction of the

383

total number of PSI complexes in SII. It is possible that the migration of LHCII in the stromal

384

lamellae is restricted due to the high density of the stromal lamellae. To test whether the

385

number of PSI-LHCII complexes would increase in SII if the density of proteins in the

386

stromal lamellae was lower, we increased the area of the stromal lamellae, effectively

387

reducing the density by half, whilst keeping the grana area the same (Fig. 3F). This led to a

388

large increase in the percentage of LHCII in the stromal lamellae, reaching 42% in SII.

389

Counterintuitively, the decreased density also led to a decrease in the number of PSI-LHCII

390

complexes from 42 % to 6.4 % (Fig. 3F). We speculate that this decrease may be due to an

391

increased entropic cost of forming the PSI-LHCII complex when the density of the stromal

392

lamellae is low.

393

We next investigated whether the movement of LHCII led to reorganization of the

394

thylakoid membrane, by analysing the nearest-neighbour distributions of PSII (including

395

C2S2M2 and C2S2 supercomplexes). In our model PSII-LHCII did not form grana-spanning

396

semi-crystalline domains, as has been seen previously (52), however we did observe a more

397

ordered arrangement of PSII supercomplexes in SI (Fig. 3G). The trimodal nearest-neighbour

398

distribution of PSII in SI (Fig. 3G, blue arrows) is in agreement with the organization of PSII

399

observed in AFM images of grana membranes in SI (7, 43, 65) as is the more disordered

400

arrangement in SII (23, 56). Despite the increase in the number of LHCII and PSI-LHCII

401

complexes in the stromal lamellae in SII compared to SI, PSI nearest-neighbour distributions

402

were indistinguishable (Fig. 3H). This is in contrast with the observed increased amount PSI

403

dimerization is SI observed in AFM images of stromal lamellae membranes (23). Here, as

404

with PSII, it is difficult to ascertain at present as to whether the discrepancy between the

405

results of the model with previous experiments is due to artefacts resulting from the

406

detergent-based isolation of membranes in Wood et al (23) or that the dimerization of PSI is

407

due to interaction not included in the model. We note that Wietrzynski et al., (8) using cryo

408

ET found no evidence of such PSI dimers in Chlamydomonas thylakoids though the PSI

409

structure is different to plants (66). A large difference between SI and SII was observed in the

410

nearest neighbour distribution of LHCII (Fig. 3I). The mean nearest neighbour distances of

411

LHCII in SI and SII were found to be 8.27 nm and 9.02 nm respectively. This can be seen in

412

the clustering of LHCII in SI (Fig. 2C) compared to the seemingly more random LHCII

413

organization in SII (Fig. 2D).

414
415

A diffusion-based lower bound for the time taken for the transition from state I to state

416

II

417

The transition from SI to SII relies on the phosphorylation of LHCII (26). This is followed by

418

the diffusion of a portion of LHCII into the stromal lamellae. However, which of the two

419

processes, phosphorylation or diffusion is the slowest and therefore rate-limiting is unclear.

420

We performed time-resolved simulations with the intention of estimating the time taken for a

421

state transition to occur if LHCII phosphorylation was immediate (the diffusion limited case).

422

We could not simulate the directly the SI to SII transition in a time resolved manner as this

423

would require a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation which is computationally unfeasible for this

424

model. Instead, we substituted a model which lacked any interactions (hereafter referred to as

425

a random distribution) in place of SII, which, in relation to the amount of LHCII in the

426

stromal lamellae, is highly similar to SII (Fig. 3C). The diffusion coefficients of the thylakoid

427

protein complexes were calculated using the Saffman-Delbrück model (57)(see methods).

428

Table 1 shows the calculated translational (DT) and rotational (DR) diffusion coefficients used

429

in the simulations. We found the half-time for the transition from SI to random as measured

430

by the proportion of LHCII in the stromal lamellae was 0.95 ms (Fig. 4A). This is much

431

faster than state transitions occur in vivo, which have a half-time of around 3-8 minutes (34),

432

suggesting the limiting factor in the time taken for state transitions to occur is the action of

18

433

the STN7 kinase. By analysis of the mean square displacement of LHCII in the random state,

434

we calculated the effective diffusion coefficient of LHCII to be 1.6 x 10-10 cm2 s-1 (Fig. 4B).

435

This is within the range observed for LHCII and phosphorylated LHCII in vivo which were

436

found to be 8.4 x 10-11 cm2 s-1 and 2.7 x 10-10 cm2 s-1 respectively (67). It is evident in this

437

model that LHCII migration into the stromal lamellae is driven by the higher density of

438

protein complexes in the grana in SI. During the course of the transition, LHCII continues to

439

flow from the grana into the stromal lamellae until they are almost at equal area densities

440

(Fig. 4C).

441
442

Lateral and stacking interactions of LHCII cooperate to increase the light-harvesting

443

antenna size and the connectivity of PSII-LHCII in SI.

444

We investigated the effects of the lateral and stacking interactions of LHCII individually, to

445

ascertain their impacts on the properties of the thylakoid membrane. Simulations were carried

446

out containing either both lateral and stacking interactions, lateral interactions only, stacking

447

interactions only, or no interactions. We found that the lateral interactions caused the LHCII

448

complexes to cluster as shown by a decrease in the nearest neighbour distances (Fig. 5A).

449

Stacking interactions did not cause clustering of LHCII complexes in the same layer (Fig.

450

5A) but the attraction between LHCII complexes on opposing layers did lead to increased

451

correlation between LHCII complexes as shown by a decreased nearest neighbour distance

452

when considering only neighbours on the opposing thylakoid layer (Fig. 5B). These results

453

were also replicated in simulations containing LHCII only (Supplementary Fig. 3).

454

Questions naturally arise from the simulations outlined above as to how the increased density

455

and clustering of LHCII in the grana in SI are implicated in the observed increase of antenna

456

size and connectivity of PSII observed in vivo (33, 68). We investigated the structure of the

457

PSII-LHCII chlorophyll light-harvesting antenna using a network-based topological analysis.

458

The antenna network consisted of LHCII trimers connected to PSII reaction centres (Fig. 6),

459

which collectively made up the vertices of the graph. Edges between neighbouring LHCII

460

trimers and/or PSII supercomplexes were introduced if there were chlorophylls in each

461

complex close enough together. That is, the Euclidean distance was less than a given value

462

called the distance threshold (Supplementary Fig. 4, Fig 6A). Reaction centres where

463

assumed to be connected to bound LHCII trimers within the same C2S2M2 or C2S2 PSII-LHCII

464

supercomplex. The quantitative properties of the antenna network are highly sensitive to the

465

chosen distance threshold for this type analysis. For this reason, we describe the phenomena

466

observed for a range of distance thresholds and show that the qualitative conclusions drawn

467

are independent of the distance threshold. Firstly, for any given distance threshold, we found

468

that PSII and LHCII network was arranged in functional clusters, with a defined number of

469

reaction centres and associated LHCII trimers akin to the heterogeneous photosynthetic unit

470

model of Lavergne & Trissl (69). At low distance thresholds (≤ 1 nm), one retrieves the

471

average antenna properties of the C2M2S2 and C2S2 supercomplexes (at equal stoichiometry),

472

namely around three LHCII trimers and two reaction centres per cluster. With lateral and

473

stacking interactions together or only lateral interactions, the size of the clusters was

474

increased, leading to a larger antenna size (Fig. 6B) and more PSIIs per cluster (Fig. 6C). The

475

increase in number of reaction centres per cluster is in agreement with the decrease in PSII

476

connectivity observed in SI by Kyle et al (33). We found only a slight increase in the

477

antennae size and the number of PSIIs per cluster when only stacking interactions were

478

present (Fig. 6B, C) compared to when no interactions were present. Using the same

479

approach, we investigated the structure of the PSI-LHCII chlorophyll network (Fig. 6D). We

480

observed a slight increase in the network-based PSI antenna size (Fig. 6D) in SII and no

interactions compared to SI. This can be seen to occur at low (< 3 nm) and high (> 5 nm)

482

distance thresholds but not in the intermediate range.

484

Discussion

485

Recent reports suggest a dual role of STN7-dependent LHCII phosphorylation. On the one

486

hand, LHCII phosphorylation leads to structural changes in the thylakoid membrane in which

487

grana diameter and the number of membrane layers per stack decreases, while the number of

488

grana per chloroplast increases (23, 31, 44). This process is driven by a increase in the

489

repulsive electrostatic force between LHCII trimers across the stromal gap of appressed grana

490

membranes (14). On the other hand, LHCII phosphorylation has been implicated in balancing

491

the excitation energy distribution between PSII and PSI as a consequence of state transitions

492

(21, 26). In addition to STN7-dependent LHCII phosphorylation, state transitions require

493

specific interactions between LHCII-P and the PsaL/H/O subunits of PSI, which lead to the

494

formation of the PSI-LHCII supercomplex (34–36). In this study we developed a molecular

495

model of the thylakoid membrane as a basis for Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the

496

role of lateral intermolecular interactions, changes in grana stacking forces and specific PSI-

497

LHCII interactions in modifying the distribution of photosynthetic complexes between the

498

two domains and the relative antenna sizes of PSI and PSII during state transitions. The value

499

of a theoretical model is the ability to clearly separate the effects of these three forces and

500

understand the extent to which they likely cooperate to bring about the changes observed in

501

vivo. Our results show three forces act largely separately to bring about specific facets of the

502

structural changes observed up state transitions.

503

The first question we addressed was how the three forces affected the distribution of LHCII

504

between the grana and stromal lamellae. In the absence of the lateral and stacking interactions

21

505

percentage of LHCII in the stromal lamellae rises due to the lower density of complexes in

506

this region. The increase we observe explains the tendency for a slight increase in the

507

chlorophyll a/b ratio of the stromal lamellae (40). The strength of the PSI-LHCII interactions

508

however did not cause appreciable changes in the percentage of LHCII in the stromal

509

lamellae. This finding is in line with experimental results that show that while mutants

510

lacking the PsaL/O/H LHCII-P binding site on PSI lack state transitions they still show a

511

transition to smaller grana in SII indicative of a movement of LHCII from grana to stromal

512

lamellae (31). The next question was how the number of PSI-LHCII supercomplexes formed

513

was affected. As the specific PSI-LHCII interaction was increased from 0 to 16 KBT the

514

number of PSI-LHCII supercomplexes increased to from 0 to 80%. In vivo 30 - 50 % of PSI

515

are found in PSI-LHCII supercomplexes (37, 42, 56). We therefore chose 3.3 KBT, which

516

resulted in 42 % of PSI in complex with LHCII, as representative of SII in our simulations.

517

Interestingly, the number of PSI-LHCII supercomplexes was not significantly higher even if

518

the protein density of the stromal lamellae was reduced by 50%, which increased the LHCII

519

percentage in the stromal lamellae to 42%. The availability of LHCII in the stromal lamellae

520

does not limit the amount of PSI-LHCII supercomplexes that are formed and thus a large

521

scale redistribution of LHCII between grana and stromal lamellae is not necessary for

522

achieving an increase in PSI antenna size, a finding consistent with previous studies (40, 41).

523

Indeed even in SI significant amounts of LHCII are found in the stromal lamellae (37, 42).

524

Our model does not take into account PSI-LHCII complexes involving the weaker digitonin-

525

sensitive LHCA binding sites (37, 38) which may further augment PSI antenna size.

526

If redistribution of LHCII between grana and stromal lamellae upon loss of lateral and

527

stacking interactions is not required for the observed increase in PSI antenna size might it

528

serve another purpose? Two other phenomena associated with LHCII phosphorylation are the

529

decrease in connectivity between PSII reaction centres (33, 68) and the faster diffusion of the

22

530

electron carriers PC and PQ/PQH2 between the grana and stromal lamellae (23). We found

531

that the cooperative effects of the lateral and stacking interactions led to larger average PSII-

532

LHCII cluster size and, moreover, more LHCII trimers per reaction centre in each cluster.

533

This was not due to a mere increase in the LHCII in the grana, which only increased by 5 %.

534

Instead we suggest the combined effect of these interactions is the more efficient recruitment

535

of free LHCII trimers in the grana into the functional PSII-LHCII clusters. The decreased

536

light harvesting capacity of PSII (antenna size and connectivity) when grana stacking

537

interactions were removed (Fig. 6B,C) has been observed in vivo (33). The effect has

538

primarily been attributed to the mixing of PSII and PSI in destacked thylakoids and the

539

consequent spillover of energy from PSII to PSI (32, 70). Previous hypotheses as to the

540

purpose of the evolution of grana in plants have dismissed the idea that the role of grana is to

541

prevent excitation energy spillover (71) on the basis that cyanobacteria lack grana yet are

542

seemingly not largely afflicted by spillover. However, we have shown that stacking

543

interactions may increase photosynthetic efficiency even when strict separation of PSII and

544

PSI is maintained. The findings presented here reopen this debate as they have shown that an

545

evolutionary advantage of grana stacking could be an increased light harvesting efficiency of

546

the PSII photosynthetic unit by more efficient recruitment of LHCII. Since this state

547

represented that of dephosphorylated LHCII, this increased cluster size may be important in

548

very low and high white light levels. At these extremes, the STN7 is inactivated causing

549

dephosphorylation of LHCII (29, 30). LHCII clustering has been previously observed in

550

high-light (72). Consequently, a large PSII antenna size allows for efficient photoprotection

551

in high light without undermining photosynthetic capacity (68). We propose that in very low

552

light, the increased PSII-LHCII cluster size enables PSII to capture and utilise light energy

553

more efficiently. Understanding the contribution of smaller grana upon LHCII

554

phosphorylation to more efficient photosynthetic electron transfer by speeding up diffusion of

555

electron carriers between the domains requires further investigation but this maybe another

556

synergistic benefit of LHCII phosphorylation, augmenting the effects of state transitions and

557

PSII connectivity (23).
In conclusion our model reveals that LHCII phosphorylation, that is the exchange of

558
559

LHCII-LHCII and LHCII-PSII lateral and stacking interactions for specific PSI-LHCII

560

interactions affects the antenna structure of the two photosystems differently. While the

561

change in PSII is an emergent property of large-scale network structure the change in PSI is

562

modulated largely by individual LHCII binding events. This idea is consistent with the fact

563

that PSII forms an interconnected photosynthetic unit (antenna lake) whereas PSI

564

connectivity is much more limited (73). Several testable hypotheses emerge from our model-

565

namely that PSII antenna connectivity and perhaps changes electron transfer kinetics brought

566

about by weakened lateral and stacking interactions may be modulated independently of

567

specific P-LHCII binding sites on PSI. Future experimental work is now needed to clarify the

568

extent to which this is true.
