ABSTRACT
With technological advancements and an aging population, there is growing interest in delivering
interventions at home. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Cognitive Remediation
(CR) have been widely studied, but mainly in laboratories or hospitals. Thus, the objectives of this
review are to examine feasibility and the interventions components to support the domiciliary
administration of tDCS and CR. We performed a systematic search of electronic databases,
websites and reference lists of included articles from the first date available until October 31, 2018.
Articles included had to meet the following criteria: original work published in English using
human subjects, majority of tDCS or CR intervention administered remotely. A total of 39 studies
were identified (16 tDCS, 23 CR/cognitive training, 5 using both tDCS & cognitive training). Four
studies were single case studies and two were multiple case studies. The remaining 33 studies had
a range of 9 – 135 participants. Five tDCS and nine CR/cognitive training studies were double
blind randomized controlled trials. Most studies focused on schizophrenia (8/39) and multiple
sclerosis (8/39). Literature examined suggests the feasibility of delivering tDCS or CR remotely
with the support of information and communication technologies.

Keywords: Cognitive Remediation, cognitive training, transcranial direct current stimulation,
home-based, remotely supervised, self-administered.

INTRODUCTION
Currently, 47 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, with nearly 10 million new cases
each year, making it the 7th global leading cause of death [1]. Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD)
represents a growing health concern and contributing to 60–70% of dementia cases worldwide [2,
3]. Given the growing prevalence rate of AD, preventative interventions and treatments that target
individuals on a population level are crucial.

There are limited effective treatments available for AD, highlighting the necessity for preventative
options. Recent research on preventative measures has focused on interventions that target brain
neuroplasticity and cognitive reserve [4] due to observed maladaptive neuroplastic changes in
various neuropsychiatric diseases [5]. Such changes are also visible in AD, whereby deficits in
cognition, may be related to disruptions in the connections among neurons and neuronal networks
[5]. Therefore, inhibiting these pathological changes and enhancing neuroplasticity may be
beneficial for preventing or delaying the onset of AD and enhancing cognition [5]. Two
interventions that have the potential of enhancing neuroplasticity and can be delivered remotely,
offering a scalable preventative effect, are transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and
cognitive remediation (CR) [4, 6].

tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that can be safely administered to awake
outpatients and works by delivering a low intensity electrical current (e.g., 2 mA) to either increase
cortical excitability with an anodal electrode, or to suppress cortical excitability with a cathodal
electrode [7]. tDCS has the potential to reduce symptoms of cognitive decline and enhance
cognition and rehabilitation in neuropsychiatric diseases [5, 8], including mild AD [9-15], through

the modulation of neuronal activity and neuroplasticity [5, 7]. Unlike other non-invasive brain
stimulation devices, tDCS equipment is readily transportable, making it a viable population-level
intervention, and an option for patients with AD who need remote assistance.

CR programs also offer a way of improving neurocognitive abilities by inducing functional
changes within the brain [4]. In CR, patients engage in computerized cognitive exercises and, with
the help of a therapist, are encouraged to utilize their metacognition in order to identify and modify
their problem-solving techniques [16]. CR has been shown to improve cognition in schizophrenia
[15], bipolar disorder [12, 13], alcohol dependence [14], and major depression [4, 8, 17]. CR
training programs are available online and therefore can be easily accessed from home.

Although a number of studies have examined the tolerability and efficacy of home-based,
remotely-supervised tDCS and cognitive training in order to determine viability [18-20], no study
to date has examined the combination of tDCS and CR delivered remotely as preventative
measures for dementia. The current review intends to summarize existing literature on remote
delivery of tDCS and CR/CT. Insight into the current research findings will allow for future
determination of the potential usefulness of these two techniques to act as preventative treatment
options for dementia on a population level.

METHODS
Selection strategy
PubMed, Ovid, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were searched focusing on studies from the
first date available to October, 31 2018 for tDCS and CR/CT at-home studies. The literature search
was divided into 2 categories:

tDCS at-home studies
Titles and abstracts for the following Medical Subject Headings (MesH) terms and keywords:
(transcranial direct current stimulation or tDCS) in combination with “at-home” OR “home-based”
OR “remotely supervised” OR “home treatment” OR “telemedicine” OR “self-administered” were
searched.

Cognitive Training and Cognitive Remediation at-home studies
Titles and abstracts for the following MesH terms and keywords were searched: (cognitive
remediation) in combination with “at-home” OR “home-based” OR “remotely supervised” OR
“home treatment” OR “telemedicine” OR “self-administered.”

Selection Criteria
tDCS at-home studies
The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) articles published in English; (2) original
research with human participants, (3) home-based intervention. Excluded papers were: (1) articles

centers; (2) review, guideline and protocol papers without reporting original research; (3) articles
that used animals as study subjects, (4) articles reporting do-it-yourself (DIY) tDCS use.

Cognitive Training and Cognitive Remediation at-home studies
The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) articles published in English; (2) original
research with human participants; (3) home-based interventions. Excluded papers were: (1) articles
reporting CR/cognitive training data from research settings such as laboratories, nursing homes,
hospitals, clinics, and research centers, (2) review, guideline and protocol papers without reporting
original research.

Data Extraction/Collection
Data extraction is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. After filtering for inclusion and exclusion criteria
and eliminating duplicates, 11 home-based tDCS papers, 23 home-based cognitive training (CT)
or CR papers, and 5 studies that discussed both home-based CT and tDCS were included from this
systematic multiple database search in the current review.

RESULTS
A total of 39 publications met the inclusion criteria for this review. Out of the 39 identified
publications, two studies were single case studies and two were multiple case studies, one
involving six participants and the other involving four participants. The remaining 33 published
articles reported on a sample size range of 9-135 participants. Studies were published between the
years of 1995-2018, and targeted multiple diagnoses including but not limited to: multiple sclerosis
[2, 19, 20, 26-28, 45], Parkinson’s disease [2, 30, 43], brain injury [44, 52], and schizophrenia [29,

37, 46, 48, 49, 51, 55]. Only three papers [21-23] and one case study [24] were published with AD
as the target population, with an additional study targeting mild vascular dementia [25]. Studies
examined in this systematic search included both males and females with a noted age range of 7.77
(standard deviation: 1.62) to 94 years of age.

Remote tDCS Research Published to Date
There were 16 studies total that met the inclusion criteria. Studies targeted a range of symptoms
and disorders, but most research focused on multiple sclerosis [2, 20, 26-28], schizophrenia [29],
Parkinson’s disease [2, 30] and dementia [24, 25].

Study Design
Of the 16 tDCS studies reviewed, five were double blind randomized controlled trials [2, 27, 3133], two were single blind randomized sham controlled trials [25, 34], two were pilot studies [20,
28], two featured a randomized double-blind cross-over design [18, 35], two were open label
studies [27, 30], one was a multiple case study with four participants [36] and two were single case
studies [24, 29].

Participants
There was high variability in the sample size and age of participants across studies. The ages of
participants ranged from 17 to 86. The number of participants in each study ranged from 1 to 45,
with an average of 19.63 (SD 12.02) participants.

also made available for use under a CC0 license.

Administration Parameters
tDCS stimulation was administered for 20 minutes per session in all studies except three [24, 29,
33]. The current used for the stimulation ranged between 1 to 3mA, with 12 studies using either
1.5mA or 2mA.

Participants either self-administered tDCS (n=5/16 studies) [33], administered tDCS with the help
of an aide or study partner (n=6/16 studies) [18, 24, 25, 29, 31, 35, 36], or could choose what they
preferred [36]. Five studies encouraged self-administration, but used a proxy or caregiver if further
assistance was required [20, 26-28, 30].

The most common electrode placement was the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex setup (DLPFC),
where the anodal electrode was placed over the left DLPFC, and the cathodal electrode over the
right DLPFC or temporal lobe (n=12/16 studies) [2, 21, 26-30, 32, 33, 35, 36]. Furthermore, the
majority of studies reviewed utilized tDCS head gear for simple and consistent electrode placement
each session (n=11/16 studies) [2, 20, 26-30, 32-34, 36].

The number of sessions administered varied across studies with participants receiving an average
of 15.17 (SD = 12.36) tDCS sessions, ranging between 4 to 60 sessions for studies lasting less than
four months. Within longer running studies, one study involved 8 months of daily tDCS sessions
[24], and another study followed a participant for three years receiving 1-2 daily treatments, with
tDCS sessions still ongoing at the time of publication [29].

Training and Safety Measures
Although the majority of studies employed tDCS training at the baseline testing visit or during the
first session at the research center (n=12/16 studies) [2, 18, 20, 26-28, 30-33, 35, 36], the length,
intensity and nature of training varied across research. In most cases training sessions consisted of
an instructional video, hands-on tDCS coaching and monitoring by a study technician [2, 26, 28,
30, 33, 35, 36], troubleshooting techniques [2, 28, 33, 35, 36], as well as an assessment of the
participant’s ability to replicate the procedures competently at home [2, 32-36]. Training also
incorporated safety assessments, including tolerability testing at the initial clinic visit [2, 20, 2628, 30, 33, 36].

Most studies implemented a number of safety measures in order to ensure safe and controlled use
of the tDCS device. This included tDCS devices that were programmed to allow for a minimum
of 12 hours between sessions [33], and devices that released a single session of stimulation after
receiving a one-time unlock code [2, 20, 26-28, 30, 33, 36]. Additional safety measures included
machines with password protected settings [34], anode and cathode sponges that had opposite male
and female connections [34], as well as tDCS machines that measured and displayed contact
quality prior to the start of stimulation [2, 20, 28, 30, 33, 35, 36].

Fidelity Monitoring
All studies (n=16 studies) used some form of fidelity monitoring including real-time monitoring
by means of video-conferencing (n=8/16 studies) [2, 20, 26-28, 30, 33, 36], remote control
software (n=7/16 studies) [2, 20, 26-28, 30, 36], daily online check-ins (n=1/16 studies) [34],

treatment diaries (n=4/16 studies) [18, 32, 33, 35], webcam or Facetime sessions (n=1/16 studies)
[34] and weekly home visits (n=1/16) [35].

Effectiveness of tDCS Treatment
Overall, all studies reviewed reported significant improvement in physical or mental symptoms,
such as a reduction in fatigue [20, 27] and pain [18, 20], improved pain management [35],
improved anxiety and dizziness ratings [34], improvements in affect [20], motor function [30],
rocking perception, [34], psychosocial functioning [29] and moderate improvements in
consciousness [35]. Further significant improvements were noted in areas of cognition, including
processing speed [20, 25], visual recall [25], attention and response variability composites [26] as
well as stabilization of cognitive decline for AD patients, with some improvement in memory
function also noted [24].

Feasibility of Remote tDCS
Many studies supported the feasibility of remotely supervised tDCS [2, 20, 30, 33, 35, 36] and
found it to be well tolerated [18, 20, 30, 33, 35], easy to use and safe [32, 33]. High compliance
rates (80% or higher) were noted in nine studies [19, 30, 33, 35, 37-41]. Only one study noted
generally poor compliance rates and a high dropout rate [42], and two other studies noted
participants training less than desired [43], or not always following the protocol [44]. The
remaining four studies did not discuss compliance rates.

Five studies addressed the combination of remotely delivered tDCS and cognitive training [2, 20,
26, 27, 30]. No additional training or supervision by study staff was discussed with the
incorporation of cognitive training into the study protocol.

Remote Cognitive Remediation and Cognitive Training Research Published to Date
There were 24 studies total that met the inclusion criteria. There was wide variability in the
populations targeted including, but not limited to, schizophrenia [37, 46, 48, 49, 51, 55] and
individuals who were at risk of developing psychosis [39], multiple sclerosis [2, 19, 45], dementia
[21-23], Parkinson’s disease [2, 43], and brain injury [44, 52].

Study Design
Among the 24 studies reviewed, there were nine double blind, randomized controlled trials [2, 19,
21, 22, 39, 40, 42, 45, 46], one randomized waitlist controlled trial study [47], one multicenter
randomized control trial [23], three pilot studies [41, 48, 49], one single group study [43], one
within subject study [50], one controlled experimental design [51], one follow-up single group
design study [52], one case control study [53], one longitudinal within-group design study [38],
one feasibility study [37], one multiple case study [54], and two single case studies [44, 55].

Participants
The age range and sample size varied, with participants ranging in age from 7 to 75. The number
of participants in each study ranged from 1 to 135, with an average of number of 41.1 (SD =35.55)
participants.

Administration Parameters
There was high variability in the administration of CR and CT. The duration of engagement, with
one exception [44], ranged from 20 minutes per day to two hours per day, with a frequency of two
to seven days per week.

There was some variability in the type of CR or CT delivered, as well as the mode of delivery. Of
the 24 studies examined, six studies utilized principles of cognitive remediation [22, 23, 38, 42,
48, 52-54], whereas the other 18 studies utilized cognitive training exclusively. Participants
completed tasks individually (n=14/24 studies) [2, 19, 38, 39, 42, 43, 45, 46, 48-53], or with a
partner (n=10/24 studies) [21-23, 37, 40, 41, 44, 47, 54, 55]. Studies used printed materials (n=7/24
studies) [21-23, 42, 44, 54, 55] and internet-based and/or computer-based programs (n=18/24
studies) [2, 19, 38, 39, 42, 43, 45, 46, 48-53] to deliver the intervention to participants. Only five
studies did not use any form of computerized program [21-23, 52, 55]. Software also varied quite
extensively in studies that utilized a computer. Posit Science was used in six different studies [19,
37, 39, 45, 46, 50], however, the program varied in its usage and utility.

A common factor across studies was utilizing programs that adjusted in difficulty level based on
participant performance (n=21/24 studies) [2, 19, 21, 22, 37-41, 43-47, 49-55].

Training and Guidance
Participant training ranged in duration and intensity and consisted of no training and self-guided
treatment (n=4/24) [38, 41, 45, 52], having one session of training in a group or alone (n=5/24) [2,
37, 40, 42, 47], weekly training [44], observational training [21, 22, 53] or training on an as-needed

basis [46]. Training generally involved printed instruction sheets and recommended strategies for
daily activities, which were explained prior to starting the intervention [54], education surrounding
the human brain, cognition and how cognition affects daily functioning [37, 42], educational
handbooks, worksheets and information about compensatory strategies [42], as well as the protocol
for the computer software [50]. Only three studies discussed initial training, whereby training was
conducted at the study center during the first session [42, 48] for two hours [37].

Fidelity Monitoring
Most research provided ongoing monitoring and support by a study technician (n=20/24 studies)
[2, 19, 38, 39, 42, 43, 45, 46, 48-53]. Software programs that allowed for monitoring/real time
feedback were utilized in most studies (n=14/24) [2, 20, 38-40, 42-44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 54].
Check-ins were also quite common (n=16/24 studies) [2, 19, 38, 39, 42, 43, 45, 46, 48-53], and
were completed primarily through phone or email at least once a week (n=7/24) [19, 37, 39, 40,
45, 49, 51]. Other studies used video conferencing multiple times a week [38], or had study staff
meet with participants once a week either at home [54, 55] or in a study clinic [54]. Additional
tools included: instructional manuals [23, 24, 39, 54, 55], participant logs [50], checklists [54], and
training schedules [45, 47, 55].

Effectiveness of Remote Delivery of Cognitive Remediation and Cognitive Training
Overall, all remote cognitive remediation and cognitive training studies reviewed showed a
positive effect in most of the parameters measured following the remote intervention. Specifically,
significant cognitive improvements were found for individuals with MS [19, 45], chronic fatigue
syndrome [53], 22q11 Deletion Syndrome [38], schizophrenia [34-36, 55], HIV [50], TBI [44],

acquired brain injury [52], and AD [21]. Areas of cognition that were improved following these
interventions include, but are not limited to, global cognition (n=9/24) [19, 21, 37, 39, 43, 45, 46,
51, 55], processing speed (n=3/24) [49, 50, 53], working memory (n=3/24) [22, 44, 53], visual
recognition (n=1/24) [44], verbal memory (n=2/24) [46, 51], word fluency (n=3/24) [21, 22, 44],
and executive functioning skills (n=5/24) [22, 46, 47, 51, 53]. Only one study did not find
improvements in cognition, however, they did find statistically significant improvements within
activities of daily living performance for stroke patients with cognitive impairments [54]. Many
studies found that improvements in areas of cognition persisted at least 3-9 months postintervention (n=5/24) [21, 40, 41, 43, 51]. Improvements in cognition were also found to be
positively correlated with quality of life (n=3/24) [42, 44, 51].

Feasibility of Remote Cognitive Training and Cognitive Remediation
Most research reported remote, home-based cognitive remediation and cognitive training
programs to be feasible, useful and well accepted for people with MS [19, 45], schizophrenia [48,
55], epilepsy [42], and those with brain damage [44, 52]. Participants indicated that the training
was beneficial, convenient [42], and enjoyable [42, 48], and supported the benefit of remote CR
using spousal caregivers for people with dementia [22]. Only one study noted that some
participants felt the cognitive training instructions were confusing [50].

DISCUSSION
The current literature suggests that both remotely administered tDCS and CR are feasible and
effective in targeting a number of cognitive functions in various patient populations. Proper
training in equipment use and regular monitoring of procedures appear crucial for study
compliance and feasibility. The literature suggests that implementing ideal components of both
CR and tDCS administration should be studied as a viable preventative treatment option for AD.

tDCS
Based on the literature reviewed, the recommendations for future trials targeting cognitive decline
in the AD population would include ensuring proper training and regular monitoring. This means
dedicating adequate training time at the initial clinic visit or arranging in-home training in order to
ensure hands-on coaching around tDCS application and proper use of the device. Explanation and
demonstration of troubleshooting techniques could be helpful to include as part of the training
procedure, including rectification techniques to manage pain and discomfort.

Considering the potential difficulty in tDCS self-administration with a predominantly elderly
population, machine safety features and a customized headset could be useful. If a headset is not
used, study partners or proxies can be utilized for tDCS application, with an anode and cathode
that are clearly distinguishable to avoid interchangeability.

Video-monitoring as well as online and in-person check-ins could be beneficial ways for ensuring
fidelity monitoring for a protocol targeting cognitive decline in the AD population. It is
recommended that participants in future studies be overseen once every week, or every two weeks,

through video conferencing or home visits by study staff. If tDCS stimulation is combined with an
online cognitive training program, monitoring could also include remote control software. In
addition, it is recommended that participants keep a log of sessions completed, either digitally or
manually, in order to ensure protocol adherence.

The effectiveness of tDCS was dose-dependent, where more sessions (20 vs 10) and an increase
in current (2.0mA vs 1.5mA) resulted in a greater reduction in fatigue [27, 29]. This suggests that
longer treatment periods and higher stimulation intensity are of greater benefit where at least 20
tDCS sessions with a current no lower than 2.0mA [18-20, 56] may be optimal. Future trials might
want to consider these settings to ensure maximum benefit.

Cognitive Remediation
Ease of use may be a necessary factor to take into account for future trials in the AD population.
Considering these patients already suffer from some cognitive decline and may be less experienced
with computer software, a simpler computer program preinstalled by study staff and a longer
training period might be preferred for tolerability. Additionally, having study staff engage in
regular monitoring (i.e. regular phone calls, home visits or video conferencing) and using programs
that ensure optimal cognitive challenge appear to be important components to consider for
effectiveness and adherence.

Future trials may also want to consider utilizing exercises that target cognitive domains typically
affected by AD related cognitive decline, such as memory, executive function, processing speed,
attention, as well as reasoning and problem solving.

Moreover, continuously challenging cognition by finding an individualized optimal level of
difficulty within the CR program used is an important aspect to consider for future trials targeting
AD related cognitive decline. With the exception of four studies [23, 42, 48, 52], all research
reviewed had cognitive exercises that adapted in difficulty level based on the participant’s
performance. This self-adjusting feature may promote continued participant engagement and
eliminate frustration brought about by seemingly unachievable difficulty parameters within the
exercises.

Strategy contemplation [38, 42, 52] and cognitive transfer [22, 42, 52, 54] are also important
components to consider within the study design, whereby participants are asked to identify skills
and strategies utilized in the exercises and apply them to real-world situations. This addition
encourages cognitive activation and the utilization of adaptive problem-solving strategies in daily
scenarios. To further cognitive transfer, some CR interventions encourage participants to seek out
cognitively challenging activities in everyday life, and engage in activities that are cognitively
stimulating outside of the program, however, this was not clearly visible in any of the studies
reviewed. These add-on techniques could be particularly helpful in slowing cognitive decline and
facilitating improvement in every day functioning and daily living within the AD population.

Limitations
A major limitation of this systematic review is that out of 39 studies reviewed, only four presented
AD as the disease targeted. More specifically, within the cluster of at-home tDCS literature

reviewed, only one case study used the intervention as a means to slow cognitive decline in an
individual with early onset AD [24]. Similarly, within the group of at-home CR articles reviewed,
one RCT targeted patients with AD [22], and one targeted individuals with Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) and AD [23]. A third article targeting AD utilized cognitive training rather than
cognitive remediation [21]. This makes it difficult to make inferences and recommendations based
on population specific difficulties encountered in past studies that could be improved upon in
future studies.

Only six studies utilized discussion guided cognitive remediation (rather than cognitive training)
as the observed intervention, with aspects of strategy awareness [55] and discussion [23, 38, 42,
52] visible in five out of six CR studies reviewed, and the addition of cognitive transfer visible in
4 out of 6 [22, 42, 52, 54]. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness and value of these
add-on techniques within a trial targeting patients at-risk for developing AD. Furthermore, as
different cognitive measures were used in each of the studies, it is difficult to determine if one
method was more effective over another.

CONCLUSIONS
With millions of individuals being diagnosed with AD worldwide each year, and the
accompanying maladaptive neuroplastic changes leading to worsening cognition, CR and tDCS
are promising preventive interventions and treatments that can target individuals on a population
level. Both CR and tDCS are effective interventions for improving cognition [4, 8-15, 17] and
have the benefit of being portable.

CR enhances frontal lobe activation and neuroplasticity [57] and it has been shown to improve
cognition in depression [4, 8, 17]. CR’s effectiveness relates to its inclusion of performance
adapting software as well as strategy-based learning and bridging discussions, which typically
occur in a group environment. However, with current technological advances, these components
of CR can be achieved remotely.

tDCS modulates neuronal activity and enhances neuroplasticity [7] and has been shown to improve
cognition in mild AD [9-11]. In other studies, participants must be present at a treatment centre in
order to receive CR, tDCS or both from trained study staff. However, this can be costly and
laborious for participants, and has the potential of being unfeasible for individuals with restricted
mobility, vocational obligations, and lengthy travel times.

Future research may like to further consider additional measures that were not fully assessed
throughout the literature examined, such as baseline ratings of reward (which may be positively
associated with cognitive gains) and inclusion of a partner or caregiver. Investigating the feasibility
of remotely delivering these interventions with other cohorts, such as individuals with mild AD,
or those at risk of developing AD, who could benefit from at-home tDCS, CR or both would also
be important considerations for prospective trials.
