Abstract:
We report the first draft of the whole genome assembly of a male Asiatic lion,
Atul and whole transcriptomes of five Asiatic lion individuals. Evaluation of genetic
diversity placed the Asiatic lion in the lowest bracket of genomic diversity index
highlighting the gravity of its conservation status. Comparative analysis with other felids
and mammalian genomes unraveled the evolutionary history of Asiatic lion and its
position among other felids. The genome is estimated to be 2.3 Gb (Gigabase) long with
62X sequence coverage and is found to have 20,543 protein-coding genes. About
2.66% of the genome is covered by simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 0.4% is
estimated to have segmental duplications. Comparison with seven well annotated
genomes indicates the presence of 6,295 single copy orthologs, 4 co-orthologs, 21
paralogs uniquely present in Asiatic lion and 8,024 other orthologs. Assessment of male
and female transcriptomes gave a list of genes specifically expressed in the male.
Our genomic analyses provide candidates for phenotypes characteristic to felids
and lion, inviting further confirmation of their contribution through population genetic
studies. An Asiatic lion-specific expansion is detected in the Cysteine Dioxygenase-I
(CDO-I) family that is responsible for taurine biosynthesis in cats. Wilm’s tumorassociated protein (WT1) family, a non-Y chromosome genetic factor underlying malesex determination and differentiation is found to have undergone expansion,
interestingly like that of the human genome. Another protein family, translation
machinery-associated protein 7 (TMA7) that has undergone expansion in humans, also
expanded in Asiatic lion and can be further investigated as a candidate responsible for
mane in lions because of its role in hair follicle morphogenesis.
INTRODUCTION:
The Asiatic lion, Panthera leo persica, is one of the most endangered large
mammals in the world. A small population of lion in Gir forests in India estimated at 523
(Gujarat Forest Department Census 2015), represents the only known remaining wild
population of an animal that historically ranged throughout most of the southeastern and
southwestern Asia, extending from Syria to north India, as recently as 200 years ago1.
The subspecies became extinct in Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan in the

later part of the 19th century. In India too, the lions were once spread across Rajasthan,
Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and western Bihar2,3.
Population pressure and extensive hunting for trophies reduced the Asiatic lions
alarmingly less in number4,5.

With strengthening conservation measures and habitat recovery by incessant
efforts of the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of lions has increased significantly in
Gir forests6. However, with the entire wild population being confined to a single location,
the Asiatic lion is facing an increased risk of extinction because of a very low number
and continuous inbreeding7,8. Morphological and molecular approaches have been used
to study genetics, population structure and evolutionary history of this species9-11. The
molecular genetic assessment of the Asiatic lions at whole genome level can be utilized
for designing further conservation and management strategies for this critically
endangered Indian big cat.

Here, we have sequenced, assembled and annotated a draft whole genome of
an Asiatic lion male named Atul. We have also characterized the transcriptome of five
individual Asiatic lions to obtain data on gene expression and to assist gene annotation.
RESULTS & DISCUSSION

Asiatic lion genome sequence and assembly:

The genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood of a male Asiatic lion
named Atul. We used the whole genome sequencing strategy on the HiSeq 2500
platform (Illumina Inc., USA) to reconstruct the genome sequence of Atul
(Supplementary Figure L1, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The isolated DNA was
subjected to sequencing using libraries of varying insert sizes; 150 base pairs (bp),
500bp, 800bp, 6kb (kilo base), 10kb, and 20kb.

In total, we generated 231 Gb

sequence data with the read lengths of 100 bp and 250 bp for pair-end and mate-pair
libraries respectively, achieving a total of 90X fold coverage of the whole genome

(Supplementary Table S3). To ensure an accurate assembly, we excluded data from
poor libraries, eliminated low-quality reads with erroneous bases or other ambiguous
sequence data, and used 152 Gb (62X) high- quality reads for de novo assembly of the
individual (Table 1, Supplementary Figure L2, L3A and L3B, Supplementary Table S4
and Methods).

We assembled the short reads using the de Bruijn graph algorithm of
SOAPdenovo (http://soap.genomics.org.cn), a genome assembler used for short read
sequences12. SOAPdenovo reported a peak sequencing depth at 62X and an estimated
genome size of 2.3 Gb by using frequency of 23-mer reads (Supplementary Table S5).

The resulting assembly scaffolds have an N50 of 20,864, the longest scaffold being 383
Kb (Supplementary Table S6).

To ensure the quality of assembly, multiple strategies were adopted including
mapping lion reads to lion scaffolds, assembling blood transcripts of five Asiatic lion
individuals and reference Feliscatus 8.0 domestic cat EST sequences (hereafter called
Fca-8.0) on to the lion scaffolds which showed a decent coverage of 86% and mapping
was quite high at 96.63% (Supplementary Tables S7-S9). Additionally, lion draft
genome assembly analyzed by core eukaryotic genes using CEGMA approach revealed
that more than 86.8% of conserved genes could be identified in the assembly
(Supplementary Table S10), indicating a good coverage and completeness of the core
gene repertoire with unique gene sequences in Asiatic lion genome assembly and it is
same as that observed in the African lion assembly13. The GC content of the Asiatic lion
genome was determined to be 39.63% (Supplementary Table S11), close to 41.66%
obtained for a domestic cat genome reference genome of Fca-8.014 and 41.4% in Amur
tiger15 suggesting less bias due to assembly quality.

The draft chromosome of Asiatic lion was constructed by mapping against the
domestic cat reference genome of Fca-8.0, the only felid to have a chromosome level
genome assembly. The lion genome showed 93.9% similarity to the domestic cat which
is similar to findings for tiger (Supplementary Table S12). The divergence times of
Felidae radiation estimated by Johnson et al.16 are suggestive that P. tigris diverged
from the felid ancestor after P. leo and is, hence, expected to show a higher genome
similarity15 reflected in the slightly lower similarity observed between Asiatic lion and
domestic cat genomes (Supplementary Tables S11 and S13-16, Supplementary
methods).
Asiatic lion genome annotation:

We compared the pattern of distribution of six important classes of genome
repeats in Asiatic lion with four other published felid genomes13,14,15,17 and found that the

genome coverage for the classes were largely conserved and reflective of the recent
divergence except for the small RNAs (Supplementary Figure L4 A and B). The striking
difference between small RNAs distribution and a similar distribution among Asiatic lion
and cheetah genomes (Supplementary Figure L4 B) might be suggestive of the low
evolutionary pressure acting on these groups. Four groups of non-coding RNA could be
delineated out of which snRNA (spliceosomal RNA and CD-box) presented the largest
genome coverage (1.2%) of a total of 4,057 ncRNA copies (Supplementary Table S17)
like the tiger genome (Supplementary Figure L5). We have also searched for the simple
sequence repeat (SSR) distribution in lion genome using our exhaustive repeat finding
algorithm, PERF18 and identified a total of 4.23 million SSRs >=12bp in length.
Together, the SSRs cover 2.66% of the Asiatic lion genome. The most frequent SSRs
are poly A/T repeats (0.53 million), followed by AG, AAAT, AC, and C repeats. A
majority (53.2%) of SSRs are hexamers, whereas, trimers are the least abundant
(2.4%) (Supplementary Figure L6A and B).

Annotation of Asiatic lion genome concluded with the prediction of 20,543
protein-coding genes by integrating evidence generated from homology-based, ab initio
and EST-based approaches (Supplementary Table S18 and S19) compared to 19,043
in Amur leopard13, 20,285 in domestic cat14, 20,226 in Amur tiger15 and 20,343 in
cheetah17. A mere 2.63% remained un-annotated (Supplementary Table S20) and the
reason can be attributed to the sizable number of annotated pantherine genomes now
available for comparison.
Genetic diversity of Asiatic lion:

Felids, in the order Carnivora, have distinctively small population sizes and are
also typified by low genetic diversity which holds pertinence in their conservation. Even
within felids, the fact, that Asiatic lion lies towards one end of the genomic diversity
spectrum, is indicated in a graph showing the rate of heterozygous SNPs per base pair
of a genome (Figure 1). This statistics has also been used as the index of genomic
diversity in other whole genomes published recently13,15,19. Mapping Asiatic lion raw

gave a rate of 0.000276 heterozygous SNVs per base pair (Supplementary Table S14

white lion and comparable with Eurasian lynx which is also facing the risk of extinction20.
The rate is also much lower than the average (0.00094) reported for Felidae genomic

diversity. The low genomic diversity characterized by low rate of heterozygous SNPs

Evolution in specific protein families and genes

Inferences drawn based on protein families expanded and contracted in a
species proteome, might be reflective of the specific adaptations the organism (or a
lineage) has undergone and is largely because of gene duplication, divergence or
recombination28. The asymmetric application of Wagner’s parsimony algorithm was
as
used to delineate the protein-families that underwent these lineage-specific evolutionary
ry
changes in Asiatic lion. Twenty-four protein families expanded while 792 underwent
nt
contraction in this species after its divergence from the common ancestor shared with
ith
the tiger lineage (Supplementary Table S26). Phylogenomic analysis showed the origin
in
of a lion to be a later event as compared to other felids at 10.5 Mya (95% CI: 10.18-10.92Mya) (Figure 4).

acid taurine which is known to be an essential nutrient in a cat’s diet and its absence
causes retinal degeneration and blindness29. Along with cysteine sulfuric acid de
carboxylase (CDAS), CDO-I is responsible in the formation of taurine from cysteine
while the former is the rate-limiting enzyme in this process. Thus, an expansion specific
to Asiatic lion can only be explained by a genomic gain that does not lead to a change
in the CDO-I enzyme activity to enhance taurine biosynthesis.

The Wilm’s tumor-associated protein (WT1) family is a known non-Y chromosome
genetic factor responsible for male-sex determination and differentiation in animals30
and mutations in this gene are known to cause urogenital abnormalities in humans31.
The family was also demonstrated to have undergone a genomic gain in human
genome and absence of the same in the closely related tiger in our analysis. The WT1
family was found to have undergone expansion in Asiatic lion after its divergence from
the pantherine ancestor although a gender-specific difference in gene expression was
not observed in our analysis. Knock-out analyses in mice have shown reduced gene
expression of male-specific markers32.

The translation machinery-associated protein 7 (TMA7) underwent expansion in
Asiatic lion. It was interestingly found to have undergone gain in human while
experiencing a loss in the more closely related domestic cat and Amur tiger
(Supplementary Table S26). Null yeast strains with TMA7 gene deletions have been
shown to have altered rates of protein synthesis33. HSPC016, a TMA7 clone, was
shown to be differentially expressed in dermal papilla cells (DPC). The DPC are pivotal
in hair follicle generation and morphogenesis. The inhibition of HSPC016 led to slower
growth and non-aggregative behavior of DPC34. The linkage between TMA7 and hair
follicle morphogenesis, its expansion in Asiatic lion and human genomes both of which
are known to have male facial hair as a common feature makes it an important
candidate for examination of a possible role in mane formation of lions.

The comparative analysis helped to provide genomic candidates to explain
phenotypic specialization in felids. For instance, the pathway analysis of protein families

expanded in Asiatic lion showed the participation of ionotropic glutamate receptor and
metabotropic glutamate receptor group III (PTHR18966:SF269) pathways. Glutamate is
one of the neurotransmitters that play a key role in synaptic transmission in the
vertebrate retina35. Its role in low-light vision of cat retina has been specifically
investigated36 which is a sensory adaptation characteristic of felines as it assists their
need to locate the prey in low-light conditions37. The SLC6A16 belonging to the orphan
sodium and chloride dependent neurotransmitter transporter family, NTT5, was found to
be positively selected in the lion genome. Positive selection in this gene might be
contributory to meet the necessity of sharper vision in lion as also among felids, in
general.
Gender-biased gene expression38 has been observed in transcriptome studies
across distinct species and the findings have been instrumental in making inferences on
important sex-specific traits. The analysis of differential gene expression between three
male and two female Asiatic lion individuals revealed four protein coding genes and one
region coding for a protein domain of ATP dependent RNA helicase DDX3Y-like protein,
all except, one Y-linked, to be enriched among males (Post FC> 2). The other maleenriched genes are Y-linked ubiquitin-specific protease 9 (USP9Y), eukaryotic
translation initiation factors 2, subunit 3 (EIF2S3Y) and lysine demethylase 5D (KDM5D)
and X-linked Zinc finger protein ZFX.

We have presented the first ever whole genome sequence of Asiatic lion. Findings
on genome organization and evolutionary divergence analyses are concordant with
those obtained for felid genomes in earlier complete genome studies. Low genomic
variation found in Asiatic lion here is typically reported for species with low population
sizes and at the brink of extinction which is important from the conservation point of
view. Genomic and gene evolution findings in the study especially, relevant to features
characteristic of lion and felids, need further corroboration through studies on multiple
individuals before they can be used for conservation and management of Asiatic lion.

METHODS

Sequencing and de novo assembly of the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica)
genome:

Genomic DNA was isolated from a fresh blood sample of a male Asiatic lion, Atul
housed in Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad,

India using NucleoSpin® Blood L

(Machery-Nagel, GmbH & Co., Germany) followed by a quality and quantity check to
ensure high molecular weight DNA for library preparation. Libraries with short insert
paired-end reads (150bp, 500bp and 800bp) and long insert mate-pair reads (4-6Kb, 810Kb and 1-20Kb) were sequenced using HiSeq 2500 (Illumina Inc., USA) at SciGenom
Labs, Cochin, India.
The raw sequencing data obtained was refined by Cutadapt39 and mate-pair data
extracted using NxTrim40 prior to assembly. The genomic contigs were assembled by
SOAPdenovo41 and CLC Genomics Workbench 9.5.3 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) and
scaffolded using CEGMApipeline42. Scaffolds obtained from SSPACE43 for CLC
assembly were chosen for downstream analysis. A de Bruijn graph constructed with 23mer frequency of read data gave an estimated genome size of 2.3 Gb (Supplementary
Table S5; Supplementary Figure L2). To check the quality of assembly, the weighted
mean of assembled contigs (N50) was determined (Supplementary Table S12,
Supplementary Figure L3) and Asiatic lion transcripts were mapped to cat ESTs
(Supplementary Table S15).
Genome annotation and Gene evolution:

The Asiatic lion genome was scanned for tandem repeats using Tandem
Repeats Finder version 4.0944. Homology-based approach was applied supplemented
with information available in Repbase version 21.0645 to identify transposable elements
(TEs). The database was used to locate repeats using Repeat Masker version 4.0.6. A
SINE-masked genome was scanned for tRNA using tRNAscan-SE version 2.046 for

determining reliable tRNA positions. snRNA and miRNA were discovered by a BLAST
alignment followed by running INFERNAL47 to search for putative sequences in the
Rfam database Release 12.1. Simple Sequence Repeats >=12bp in length were
identified using PERF18.

The Asiatic lion genome annotation was carried out by following an in-house
pipeline CANoPI (Contig Annotator Pipeline) maintain by Scigenom Ltd., for comparison
with UniProt using BLASTP, organism annotation, gene and protein annotation to the
matched CDSs, gene ontology and pathway annotation.

Phylogenomic analyses were shown to delineate the position of Asiatic lion in the
mammalian and felid phylogenies. To accomplish this, we used published whole
genomes of human (GRCh38.p9), mouse (GRCm38.p5), cheetah (AciJub1.0), tiger
(PanTig 1.0), domestic cat (Felis_catus-8.0), panda (aiMel1.0), dog (CanFam3.1) and
opossum (monDom5.0) was reconstructed using concatenated amino acid sequences.
The phylogenomics was reconstructed using BioNJ48 of PhyML49 followed by fastNNI50
for tree optimization and LG model of substitution51 was applied. TREEVIEW was used
for the visualization of resulting trees. (Supplementary Figure L8 and L9). Divergence
dating was done using MCMCTREE implemented in PAML version 4.052.

The proteome of Asiatic lion was again compared with the well-annotated
proteomes of seven mammals, domestic cat, tiger, dog, panda, human, mouse, and
opossum to delineate the extent of gene orthology among these organisms using
TreeFam53 and OrthoMCL54 methodologies to predict orthologs, co-orthologs and
paralogs. The Pfam55 was used to predict the number of protein families
(Supplementary Table: S21). These analyses helped to identify gene function in Asiatic
lion genome by scrutinizing conserved regions among gene orthologs. Since the
organisms being examined belong to different orders (Carnivora, Rodentia, Primata,
Didelphimorphia), the analysis was helpful in studying the extent of protein evolution in
them.

The ratio of rates of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS), ω
was computed using the CODEML program of the PAML package56 from the alignment
of annotated genomes of Asiatic lion, tiger, cat, dog, mouse, panda and opossum
obtained by PRANK57,58. Only 1:1 orthologs were used for this analysis. The branch-site
model in which

ω

can vary at specific sites of a gene sequence and branches of

phylogeny was applied59.

The blood transcriptomes of three male Asiatic lions and two female Asiatic lions
were aligned using STAR, which uses a sequential maximum mappable seed search
followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure60. RNA-Seq by Expectation
Maximization (RSEM) was applied to evaluate and carry out a differential analysis61
allowing a false discovery rate less than 0.05. The number of paired reads (expected
counts) was estimated for genes exhibiting a 2-fold change were considered as
differentially expressed in male samples (Supplementary Table - S30). Male-specific
genes were selected based on a minimum value of 2 in PostFC which is the posterior
fold change for a gene/transcript each gene.
Draft chromosomes of Asiatic lion:

The Asiatic lion genome contigs were aligned with the genome of domestic cat
(Felis_catus 8.0) as reference using bwa-mem program of BWA62, to determine the
chromosome location and order of scaffolds. EMBOSS63 was used to merge two
overlapping scaffolds. Chromosomes and pseudo-molecules were reconstructed based
on the synteny observed between the Asiatic lion and domestic cat genomes.
Chromosomal synteny:

The Whole Genome Assembly Comparison (WGAC) was done to find segmental
