ABSTRACT

25

While the basic mechanisms of flavivirus entry and fusion are understood, little is

26

known about the post-fusion events that precede RNA replication, such as

27

nucleocapsid disassembly. We describe here a sensitive, conditionally

28

replication-defective yellow fever virus (YFV) entry reporter, YFV∆SK/Nluc, to

29

quantitively monitor the translation of incoming, virus particle-delivered genomes.

30

We validated that YFV∆SK/Nluc gene expression can be neutralized by YFV-

31

specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways, including clathrin-

32

and dynamin-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification, YFV E

33

glycoprotein-mediated fusion, and cellular LY6E expression; however, as

34

expected, gene expression from the defective reporter virus was insensitive to a

35

small molecule inhibitor of YFV RNA replication. YFV∆SK/Nluc gene expression

36

was also shown to require cellular ubiquitylation, consistent with recent findings

37

that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid

38

uncoating to occur, as well as valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular

39

ATPase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large

40

macromolecular complexes. RNA transfection and washout experiments showed

41

that VCP/p97 functions at a post-fusion, pre-translation step in YFV entry.

42

Together, these data support a critical role for VCP/p97 in the disassembly of

43

incoming flavivirus nucleocapsids during a post-fusion step in virus entry.

IMPORTANCE

50

Flaviviruses are an important group of RNA viruses that cause significant human

51

disease. The mechanisms by which flavivirus nucleocapsids are disassembled

52

during virus entry remain unclear. Here we show that the yellow fever virus

53

nucleocapsid disassembly requires the cellular protein-disaggregating enzyme

54

valosin-containing protein, also known as p97.

INTRODUCTION
Flaviviruses are a large, genetically-related group of positive-strand RNA

66

viruses that are classified as a genus, Flavivirus, within the family Flaviviridae,

67

including several medically important, arthropod-borne human pathogens such

68

as dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus (WNV),

69

yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) (1). Infectious virions are small

70

(~50 nm diameter), enveloped particles that display 180 copies of the envelope

71

(E) glycoprotein and a small transmembrane protein, M, on their surface,

72

surrounding an inner nucleocapsid composed of the viral capsid protein and an

73

unsegmented RNA genome of ~11-kb (2, 3). While the surface of flavivirus

74

particles are relatively well-defined, the nucleocapsid lacks apparent symmetry or

75

higher-order structure (2, 4).

76

Flavivirus infection initiates through interaction of the viral E glycoprotein

77

with one or more host cell attachment factors that serve to concentrate the

78

virions on cell surface, as well as virus entry receptors that have only been

79

partially identified (5). Virus internalization occurs through clathrin- and dynamin-

80

dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis (6). As internalized virus particles

81

pass through endosomes they encounter low pH, which triggers rearrangement

82

of the E glycoprotein, leading to fusion and release of viral nucleocapsids into the

83

cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1A).

84

Once in the cytoplasm, flavivirus nucleocapsids are presumably

85

disassembled to release the viral genome, which must be translated in order to

86

initiate infection. The viral genome encodes a single open reading frame, which

87

is translated to produce a polyprotein that is processed by viral and cellular

88

proteases to yield three structural proteins: capsid (C), pre-M (prM), and E; as

89

well as seven nonstructural (NS) proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A,

90

NS4B, and NS5 (Fig. 1B). NS1 is a secreted glycoprotein that is required for

91

RNA replication; it forms dimers that remain peripherally associated with the

92

inner leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane or on the cell surface,

93

as well as secreted hexameric lipoprotein particles that induce strong humoral

94

responses and contribute to flavivirus pathogenesis (3, 7). NS2A, NS2B, NS4A,

95

and NS4B are polytopic membrane proteins required for RNA replication. NS2B

96

and NS3 form a membrane-anchored enzyme complex with serine protease and

97

RNA helicase activities essential for viral polyprotein processing and RNA

98

replication (3, 8). NS5 is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA

99

capping enzyme (3, 9, 10). Once translated, the NS proteins presumably recruit

100
101

the viral genome out of translation and into an RNA replication complex.
Little is known about the process of flavivirus nucleocapsid disassembly.

102

Nucleocapsids obtained by solubilizing WNV particles with nonionic detergent

103

are partially accessible for translation (11), suggesting that nucleocapsids may

104

spontaneously uncoat. On the other hand, intact nucleocapsids can be isolated

105

from detergent-solubilized tick-borne encephalitis virus particles (12); these

106

nucleocapsids are stable in physiologic salt but dissociate in high salt, >0.5 M

107

sodium chloride. In cell culture, however, DENV capsid protein must be

108

ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating and genome translation to

109

occur (13), suggesting that uncoating is an active process in vivo.

110

Here we describe a sensitive, conditionally replication-defective YFV

111

reporter virus designed to probe the early, pre-replication events of the flavivirus

112

life cycle. We validate the specificity of this reporter to monitor YFV entry and

113

pre-replication events, confirm that YFV entry requires ubiquitylation, then used

114

this tool to examine the hypothesis that YFV nucleocapsids are disassembled by

115

valosin-containing protein (VCP), also known as p97.

116

VCP/p97 is a conserved and abundant eukaryotic AAA+ ATPase that uses

117

the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to unfold ubiquitylated proteins and

118

extract them from large macromolecular complexes (14, 15). VCP/p97 forms

119

hexameric double-ring structures with a central pore (16, 17). Each subunit is

120

composed of an N-terminal regulatory domain and two RecA-like ATPase

121

domains that stack against each other to form the hexameric holoenzyme.

122

VCP/p97 plays an essential role in protein homeostasis and genome stability; it is

123

therefore an attractive target for anticancer therapies and several potent and

124

specific VCP/p97 inhibitors have been developed (18). We show here that

125

VCP/p97 inhibitors block the initiation of YFV infection, interfering with a post-

126

fusion, pre-replication event during virus entry.

RESULTS

128

YFV reporter viruses are sensitive tools to monitor early events of

129

flavivirus infection. A key challenge to studying the early life cycle events of

130

some positive-strand RNA viruses is in detecting the initial rounds of translation

131

of incoming, virion-released genomes. While viruses can be engineered to

132

express sensitive reporter genes, signals produced by translation of the incoming

133

viral genome are soon overwhelmed by translation of genomes produced by

134

RNA replication. Therefore, in order to specifically study early, pre-replication

135

events in the life cycle of flaviviruses, we sought to uncouple translation from

136

RNA replication by constructing a YFV reporter, based on the live-attenuated

137

strain 17D (YFV-17D), that is conditionally defective for RNA replication. The

138

YFV-17D mutant YFV∆SK, which contains a large, in-frame deletion within the

139

essential NS1 gene, is incapable of initiating RNA replication but can be

140

complemented in trans (19). Thus, in the absence of NS1, a YFV∆SK-based

141

reporter virus should allow viral entry, fusion, uncoating, and primary translation

142

of the incoming genome to be monitored (Fig. 1A).

143

First, we constructed a full-length, infectious YFV-17D reporter virus that

144

expresses the Nano-luciferase (Nluc) enzyme, based on previously described

145

flavivirus reporter designs (20-22). We chose Nluc because of its smaller size

146

(19.1 kDa; 171 codons), enhanced stability, and exquisite sensitivity compared to

147

other luciferases (23). A cassette encoding Nluc, the foot-and-mouth disease

148

virus 2A codon-skipping peptide, and a ubiquitin monomer was inserted in-frame

149

into the YFV-17D infectious clone after the first 25 codons of the YFV-17D C

150

gene, which contains the essential 5´ RNA cyclization sequence (24, 25),

151

followed by the entire YFV polyprotein coding sequence, to generate

152

YFV17D/Nluc (Fig. 1B). After transfection into BHK-21 cells, YFV-17D/Nluc RNA

153

transcripts replicated and gave rise to infectious virus with peak titers similar to

154

wild-type YFV-17D (≥1 × 107 PFU/ml at 48 h post-transfection) but had a small

155

plaque phenotype (Fig. 1C). Similar replication impairments have been reported

156

with other flavivirus reporter constructs (22). Nluc expression was stably

157

maintained for at least three serial virus passages in BHK-21 cells; we did not

158

specifically address the long-term stability of the Nluc insert. Based on prior

159

reports of flavivirus insert instability, we expect that Nluc expression will be lost

160

with passage and therefore limited our experiments to early passage stocks of

161

virus. Importantly, YFV-17D/Nluc was able to infect and replicate in BHK cells,

162

as observed by the robust accumulation of Nluc activity over time (Fig. 1D).

163

Robust Nluc expression was also observed upon YFV-17D/Nluc infection of other

164

established cell lines, including Huh-7.5, HEK 293, SW-13, and primary mouse

165

fibroblasts (data not shown). Furthermore, Nluc expression levels directly

166

correlated with the amount of input virus in an endpoint dilution assay (Fig. 1E);

167

notably, some replicates were Nluc-negative at higher dilutions, indicating that an

168

end-point had been reached (i.e., some replicate wells received no virus, while

169

other wells received one or a few viruses). Notably, Nluc activity was 10- to 100-

170

fold higher in positive wells around the endpoint, which likely received only a

171

single virus particle, than negative wells (Fig. 1E). Based on this, we were able

172

to calculate a tissue culture-infectious dose, 50% endpoint (TCID50) of 3.54 × 104

173

TCID50/mL, which was similar to the plaque infectivity titers (3.25 × 104 PFU/mL)

174

of this same early-harvest (18 h post-transfection), low-titer stock. We

175

consistently noted that virus stocks harvested after cytopathic effects became

176

evident contained significant Nluc activity, presumably due to enzyme release

177

into the conditioned medium by cell lysis. Thus, early virus harvests provided

178

optimal signal:noise ratio without requiring extensive washing during virus

179

inoculation (see Methods for detailed information). Taken together, these data

180

show that YFV-17D/Nluc is a sensitive reporter virus for measuring YFV-17D

181

infection and replication.

182

Next, we generated a conditionally replication-defective construct,

183

YFV∆SK/Nluc, containing a large in-frame deletion within the essential NS1 gene

184

(19). Upon transfection of RNA transcripts into BHK-21 cells that express YFV

185

NS1 (BHK-NS1), YFV∆SK/Nluc replicated, expressed Nluc, and produced

186

infectious virus. YFV∆SK/Nluc virus infected BHK-NS1 cells and expressed

187

robust Nluc activity (Fig. 1F, blue circles); however, infection of parental BHK-21

188

cells, which do not express NS1, led to modest but significant levels of Nluc

189

expression (Fig. 1F, green circles). To confirm that the Nluc activity observed in

190

BHK-21 cells that lack NS1 expression was due to the entry and translation of

191

YFV∆SK/Nluc, we performed an additional time course in the presence or

192

absence of cycloheximide (CHX), a potent inhibitor of translation. Nluc

193

expression was detectable as early as 30 min post-infection, increased >10-fold

194

higher than in CHX-treated cells by 90 min post-infection, and plateaued by 7 h

195

post-infection (Fig. 1G). Given the tight requirement for NS1 in flavivirus RNA

196

replication, these results demonstrate that YFV∆SK/Nluc is a sensitive reporter to

197

measure the translation of incoming viral genomes.

198

Nluc reporter viruses mimic authentic flavivirus infection and Nluc

199

activity correlates with cellular entry. To further validate the utility of

200

YFV∆SK/Nluc for monitoring early stages of virus infection, we asked whether it

201

exhibited known features of flavivirus entry and replication. First, we asked

202

whether Nluc expression was sensitive to YFV-specific neutralizing antibodies.

203

As shown in Fig. 2A, Nluc expression from both YFV-17D/Nluc and

204

YFV∆SK/Nluc was neutralized by serum from an interferon-α/β R-/- mouse

205

immunized with YFV-17D, while non-immune control serum did not neutralize

206

Nluc expression. Similarly, serum from a human YFV-17D vaccinee neutralized

207

both reporter viruses, while pooled human serum did not (Fig. 2B). Together,

208

these data confirm that Nluc expression is dependent on infectivity of the YFV

209

reporter viruses.

210

Flaviviruses enter target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, which

211

requires clathrin and dynamin, and delivery to endosomes, where viral fusion is

212

induced by the low pH of this compartment (26). Consistent with this viral entry

213

pathway, expression of Nluc by YFV∆SK/Nluc was sensitive to Pitstop2, an

214

inhibitor of clathrin-coated pit formation (Fig. 2C), and to Dynasore, an inhibitor of

215

dynamin (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, expression of Nluc by YFV∆SK/Nluc was

216

sensitive to ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), a weak base that buffers endo-

217

lysosomal compartments (Fig. 2E), and to Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of

218

the vacuolar H+-ATPase pump (Fig. 2F). As shown in Fig. 2G, Nluc expression

219

by YFV∆SK/Nluc was sensitive to K784-9103, a small-molecule that binds to

220

DENV E protein and inhibits membrane fusion of DENV and other flaviviruses

221

(27). Furthermore, Nluc expression was reduced 3.1-fold by genetic ablation of

222

LY6E (Fig. 2H), a host factor that facilitates internalization of flaviviruses and

223

other viruses (28, 29). These results confirm that YFV∆SK/Nluc gene expression

224

are dependent on clathrin, dynamin, LY6E-mediated trafficking, endosomal

225

acidification, and YFV E-mediated fusion, consistent with the known pathways of

226

flavivirus entry.

227

We also examined the effects of benzodiazepine acetic acid (BDAA), a

228

low micromolar inhibitor of YFV RNA replication that targets NS4B (30). In

229

contrast to the entry-specific inhibitors used above, BDAA potently inhibited Nluc

230

expression by YFV-17D/Nluc but had no effect on Nluc expression by

231

YF∆SK/Nluc (Fig. 2I), confirming that YF∆SK/Nluc is a sensitive reporter of pre-

232

replication events in the YFV life cycle.

233

Ubiquitination and valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) are essential

234

for early stages of YFV infection. Since DENV genome uncoating requires a

235

non-proteolytic ubiquitylation step (13), we next examined whether YFV also

236

requires ubiquitylation at an early step in its life cycle. As shown in Figure 3A,

237

expression of Nluc activity during YFV∆SK/Nluc infection was blocked by Pyr-41,

238

a potent, specific, and irreversible inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1

239

(31), confirming that ubiquitylation is required for an early, pre-replication event in

240

the YFV life cycle. To clarify the stage in entry where ubiquitylation is required,

241

we bypassed the viral entry process by directly transfecting YFV∆SK/Nluc RNA

242

into BHK cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, Pyr-41 did not inhibit Nluc expression after

243

RNA transfection. These results show that ubiquitylation is required for an early

244

step in YFV entry, upstream of genome release (i.e., uncoating), consistent with

245

the finding that ubiquitylation is required for the disassembly of the DENV

246

nucleocapsid (13).

247

The above results suggested that ubiquitin can tag incoming

248

nucleocapsids for subsequent uncoating by an unidentified host factor. The

249

eukaryotic AAA+ ATPase VCP/p97 utilizes energy released from ATP hydrolysis

250

to unfold ubiquitylated client proteins and extract them from larger complexes

251

(14). We therefore tested the hypothesis that VCP/p97 promotes disassembly of

252

the YFV nucleocapsid. As VCP/p97 is an abundant cellular protein, efficient

253

knockdown takes several days to achieve a loss-of-function phenotype, which

254

can cause pleiotropic effects on cells (32). Therefore, in order to specifically

255

examine the role of VCP/p97 in YFV entry we chose two small molecules, DBeQ

256

and NMS873, which work through different mechanisms of action to potently and

257

specifically inhibit VCP/p97 in a matter of minutes, rather than days (33, 34).

258

DBeQ and NMS873 potently inhibited Nluc expression after infection with

259

YFV∆SK/Nluc virus particles (Fig. 3A) but did not inhibit Nluc expression after

260

transfection of YFV∆SK/Nluc RNA (Fig. 3B), indicating that VCP/p97 is

261

necessary for YFV entry, prior to the delivery and translation of incoming YFV

262

genomes.

263

To clarify the step at which VCP/p97 functions during YFV entry, we

264

conducted a washout experiment. As shown in Fig. 3C, DBeQ inhibition of

12

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/814764; this version posted October 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

265

YFV∆SK/Nluc entry could be reversed by drug washout at 1 h post-infection.

266

Moreover, DBeQ washout bypassed the sensitivity to BafA1, indicating that

267

VCP/p97 functions at a post-fusion step of YFV entry. We were unable to

268

perform the converse experiment, washout of BafA1 followed by DBeQ

269

treatment, because BafA1 washout was inefficient, consistent with the low

270

nanomolar dissociation constant of this compound (35). Importantly, Pyr-41,

271

DBeQ, NMS873, and CHX treatments were not toxic under the concentrations

272

and time scales used in our studies (Fig. 3D), indicating that their abilities to

273

block viral gene expression were not simply due to cellular toxicity. Taken

274

together, these data suggest that VCP/p97 has a post-fusion, pre-replication

275

function early in the YFV life cycle.

276

VCP/p97 is required for early events in the life cycle of replication-

277

competent flaviviruses. To determine whether ubiquitylation and VCP/p97 are

278

also required for post-replication viral gene expression, we examined Nluc

279

expression by the replication-competent YFV-17D/Nluc. As shown in Fig. 4A-B,

280

Pyr-41 and DBeQ potently inhibited Nluc expression by 18 h post-infection with

281

YFV-17D/Nluc, but not after 18 h post-transfection of YFV-17D/Nluc RNA. Since

282

robust expression of Nluc activity at late times of infection (>8 h) depends on

283

YFV-17D/Nluc replication (compare Figs. 1D, 1F, and 1G), these data suggest

284

that ubiquitylation and VCP/p97 are specifically required for early events in the

285

YFV life cycle.

286

inhibited the expression of NS1 at 24 h post-infection with the Kunjin strain of

289

WNV (WNVKUN) or Cambodian FSS 13025 strain of ZIKV. These data suggest

290

that multiple flaviviruses depend on cellular ubiquitylation and VCP/p97 activity.

DISCUSSION
Flaviviruses initiate infection via a transient, multistep cellular entry

294

process that poses some unique challenges to study. Early efforts focused on

295

the identification of virus-specific receptors and in defining the mechanisms of

296

antibody-mediated enhancement (36, 37). However, to date only a few flavivirus

297

entry factors and putative entry receptors have been identified, including DC-

298

SIGN (38, 39), DC-SIGNR (40), mannose receptor (41), and multiple

299

phosphatidylserine receptors (42). Nevertheless, for many of these cell entry

300

factors, the specific role(s) in flavivirus entry remains elusive (5).

301

The processes of flavivirus internalization and fusion were originally

302

characterized by using biochemical and cell biological approaches with high

303

MOIs of radiolabeled virus particles, revealing a requirement for endocytosis and

304

endosomal acidification (43, 44). While working with infectious, radiolabeled

305

virus particles may be slightly inconvenient, the use of high MOIs is potentially

306

more problematic, as aggregates of virus particles can influence the apparent

307

mechanisms of viral entry (45). More recently, the entry of individual,

308

fluorescently-labeled flavivirus particles has been visualized at low MOI through

309

live cell imaging (26, 46-48). An important caveat to this approach is that

310

flavivirus preparations typically have relatively low specific infectivities (46, 47,

14

311

49), so it is difficult to know whether a given particle under observation is on a

312

pathway toward productive infection.

313

Given the above considerations, we chose to pursue a function-based

314

approach to study the productive entry of a recombinant YFV that expresses a

315

reporter enzyme only after viral entry and translation. Several flavivirus reporter

316

systems have been developed, mainly for high-throughput screening of viral

317

replication (13, 22, 50-57). In one remarkable study, Byk, et al., adapted a Renilla

318

luciferase-expressing DENV reporter virus to show that the incoming DENV

319

capsid protein must be ubiquitylated prior to viral gene expression (13). However,

320

an important consideration of this experimental design is that flavivirus-encoded

321

reporter genes are continuously expressed, making it difficult to rigorously

322

conclude that reporter activity was translated from an incoming viral genome

323

versus viral RNAs produced by replication, i.e., because both viral entry and RNA

324

replication can contribute to reporter gene expression, the translation of incoming

325

genomes could only be inferred based on the kinetics of when reporter gene

326

expression first became observable. Byk, et al. attempted to control for this

327

concern by using CHX to inhibit translation (13); however, CHX inhibits viral gene

328

expression irrespective of whether the genome was delivered by a virus particle

329

or newly synthesized by RNA replication. A further consideration is that reporter

330

enzymes differ in their specific activities; thus, enzymes with low specific activity

331

require higher MOIs to achieve similar sensitivity of early translation events. In

332

this regard, it is notable that Byk, et al. did not report the MOIs used in their

333

DENV entry studies; however, several of their experiments used MOIs sufficiently

334

high to allow incoming capsid protein to be detected by western blot (13).

335

Despite these minor technical caveats, Byk, et al. clearly demonstrated that

336

incoming DENV capsid protein must be ubiquitylated before viral gene

337

expression can be detected.

338

Given the above considerations, we sought to build a sensitive YFV

339

reporter specific for detecting translation of incoming viral genomes. First, we

340

used the Nluc reporter gene, which exhibits >100-fold greater specific activity

341

over firefly and Renilla luciferases (58). Second, we created a conditionally

342

replication-defective reporter by incorporating a large, in-frame deletion in the

343

essential NS1 gene, which can be supplied in trans (19, 59). The NS1

344

glycoprotein, which is expressed within the secretory pathway, contributes to the

345

cytosolic process of RNA replication via interaction with the polytopic NS4A and

346

NS4B membrane proteins, likely within the NS4A-2K-NS4B polyprotein

347

intermediate (60-62). NS1 also has distinct membrane-alteration properties (61,

348

63), which likely contribute to replication complex assembly. In the absence of

349

NS1 expression, flavivirus infections are halted prior to replication complex

350

formation and the initial round of RNA synthesis (19, 61, 64, 65). Consistent with

351

this, robust Nluc expression by YFV-17D/Nluc was sensitive to a YFV-specific

352

RNA replication inhibitor, BDAA, while the modest Nluc expression by

353

YFV∆SK/Nluc was not. Thus, the YFV∆SK/Nluc virus faithfully reports on early,

354

post-fusion, pre-replication events in the flavivirus life cycle.

355
356

Our experimental approach should be generally applicable to other
flaviviruses. It is notable that two groups previously described NS1 deletion-

357

reporter virus systems for WNV and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (57, 66).

358

These constructs were originally designed to reduce biosafety risks for high-

359

throughput screening; our data suggest that these constructs should also be

360

useful in dissecting early, pre-replication events in the life cycle of these

361

flaviviruses. Further improvements to our design are also possible; for instance,

362

smaller tags, such as a split Nluc reporter (55), could improve viral titers or allow

363

post-fusion events to be monitored prior to viral genome translation.

364

We validated that YFV∆SK/Nluc gene expression was neutralized by YFV-

365

specific antibodies and was dependent on several known pathways of flavivirus

366

entry, including clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis (6, 26, 67-69),

367

endosomal acidification (47, 68-71), E protein-dependent fusion (27), and

368

dependence on LY6E (28, 29).

369

We then applied our YFV reporter system to address the role of

370

ubiquitylation and protein homeostasis in flavivirus entry, which has been

371

controversial. As part of a genome-wide RNAi screen, Krishnan, et al. first

372

reported that knockdown of ubiquitin ligase CBLL1 inhibited internalization of

373

WNV particles into HeLa cells, and that WNV entry was sensitive to proteasome

374

inhibitors (72). However, these findings were called into question by Fernandez-

375

Garcia, et al., who found that entry of WNV, YFV, and DENV was insensitive to

376

rigorously validated knockdown of CBLL1 or by proteasome inhibitors (73).

377

Furthermore, while JEV entry is also inhibited by proteasome inhibitors (74),

378

these compounds can decrease the cellular pools of free ubiquitin (75-77), so the

379

role of ubiquitylation vs. proteasome activity in flavivirus entry has been unclear.

380

Byk, et al. brought clarity to this issue by demonstrating that ubiquitylation is

381

required for DENV capsid disassembly (13). Furthermore, proteasome activity is

382

dispensable for DENV entry, but is responsible for the turnover of incoming

383

capsid protein, presumably after disassembly (13).

384

Our studies confirm that ubiquitylation is required for flavivirus entry,

385

although the relevant substrate(s) are unknown. Given that incoming DENV

386

capsid protein is turned over in a proteasome-dependent manner, and that

387

inhibition of proteasome activity leads to the accumulation of a slightly higher

388

molecular weight form of capsid protein (13), it is likely that YFV capsid is directly

389

ubiquitylated. It is not yet clear how nucleocapsids are targeted for ubiquitylation,

390

nor whether there is a preferred site on capsid protein for this modification. In

391

this regard, DENV mutants lacking lysine residues in the capsid protein were

392

able to infect and translate their genomes normally (13), suggesting that the

393

capsid protein may be ubiquitylated at the N-terminus or other non-canonical

394

residue(s) (78). Future work would be needed to identify of the relevant E3

395

ligase(s) and the type(s) of ubiquitin linkage that modify flavivirus capsid proteins.

396

VCP/p97 functions to unfold and extract proteins from macromolecular

397

complexes in a ubiquitin- and ATP-dependent manner (14). For instance,

398

VCP/p97 dissociates ubiquitylated IκBα from NF-κB, activating this transcription

399

factor (79). VCP/p97 contributes to ER-associated degradation by extruding

400

misfolded proteins from the secretory pathway for subsequent delivery to the

401

proteasome (80). Similarly, VCP/p97 contributes to ribosome-associated quality

402

control by extracting misfolded nascent polypeptides from the translation

403

apparatus (81, 82). VCP/p97 has additional roles in extracting client substrates

404

from chromatin, mitochondria, and other large macromolecular complexes. It is

405

worth noting that VCP/p97 has a weak affinity for ubiquitin and relies on a large

406

array of cofactors, which typically encode enzymatic activities to facilitate

407

VCP/p97 substrate processing, or adaptor molecules, which simply link VCP/p97

408

to client substrates. Each of these adaptors and cofactors carry binding surfaces

409

that recognize VCP/p97 and ubiquitin, respectively (83, 84). Thus, VCP/p97

410

contributes to diverse cellular functions based this modular cofactor- and

411

adaptor-mediated targeting.

412

Based on our finding that VCP/p97 activity is required for an early, post-

413

fusion event prior to the translation and replication of incoming YFV genomes, we

414

propose a model wherein VCP/p97 functions to disassemble ubiquitylated

415

nucleocapsids (Fig. 5). Although we have illustrated free nucleocapsids within

416

the cytosol, we cannot exclude the possibility that fusion is tightly coupled to

417

capsid ubiquitylation and disassembly, such that nucleocapsids may be

418

disassembled as they are exposed to the cytosol. Consistent with our model,

419

VCP/p97 activity was previously shown to be important for WNV, JEV, and

420

DENV infections, although specific role(s) for VCP/p97 in virus entry were not

421

determined (55, 85). We cannot also exclude a role for ribosome engagement to

422

facilitate disassembly.

423

The nature of VCP/p97 interaction with flavivirus nucleocapsids is

424

presently unknown but may well involve cellular VCP/p97 cofactors. It is possible

425

that VCP/p97 may be directly recruited to endo-lysosomal organelles via binding

426

to early endosomal autoantigen, clathrin, or caveolin, as demonstrated by

427

previous proteomic studies (86-88). Once recruited to endosomes, VCP/p97 may

428

have direct access to ubiquitylated capsid protein during fusion or to an unknown

429

ubiquitylated host protein that associates with capsid protein.

451

and pYF-17D/5ʹC25Venus2AUbi were previously described (20, 21). Plasmid

pYF17D/Nluc was constructed by replacing the Venus coding region of pYF-

453

17D/5ʹC25Venus2AUbi with that of the Nluc gene (Promega, Madison, WI) by

454

using standard molecular biology techniques and verified by restriction digestion

455

and sequencing. Briefly, the SrfI–NsiI region of pYF17D/5ʹC25Venus2AUbi was

456

subcloned into a shuttle vector, pSL1180, generating the pSL1180/S17DN

457

intermediate. The Nluc coding region was PCR amplified with primers YO-3008

(5´- ggg ccc GAG CTC ATG GTC TTC ACA CTC GAA GAT TTC GTT G-3´) and

459

YO-3009 (5´- ggg ccc acc ggt CGC CAG AAT GCG TTC GCA CAG CCG CCA

461

pSL1180/S17DN, resulting in replacement of Venus with Nluc. The SrfI–NsiI

462

fragment was then subcloned back into pCC1/YF-17D to generate pYF17D/Nluc.

463

The construction and use of pYF∆SK as well as pSINrep21-NS1 was described

464

previously (19, 64). To generate pYF∆SK/Nluc, the 7221-bp NsiI–ClaI fragment

of pACNR/YF∆SK was subcloned into pYFV17D/Nluc cut with these same

473

cells were then selected for one week in complete growth medium supplemented

474

with 5 µg/ml puromycin. Reporter virus RNAs were transcribed from XhoI-

475

linearized plasmid templates pYF17D/Nluc and pYF∆SK/Nluc by using SP6 RNA

476

polymerase in the presence of the ARCA synthetic cap analog (New England

477

Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Primary stocks of reporter virus were generated by

478

electroporation of BHK-21 clone 15 or BHK-NS1 cells with YFV RNA transcripts,

479

as previously described (19). At 36 h post-electroporation, conditioned media

480

containing primary YFV-17D/Nluc or YFV∆SK/Nluc stocks were harvested and

481

clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to remove cell debris.

482

Pilot experiments showed that primary stocks of YFV-17D/Nluc virus

483

harvested at late time points (≥36 h post-transfection) contained high levels of

484

Nluc released into the conditioned cell culture media, which correlated with the

485

onset of virus-induced cytopathic effects. Therefore, to help minimize

486

background, primary stocks of Nluc-expressing virus were dialyzed via

487

ultrafiltration with Centricon plus-80 (containing 100-kDa nominal molecular

488

weight cut-off polyethersulfone filters) to remove contaminating background Nluc

489

activity. Furthermore, secondary virus stocks with minimal Nluc background

490

were harvested at early (<24 h) times post-infection, albeit with reduced titers.

491

Specifically, primary virus stocks were passaged on several 15-cm dishes of

492

~70% confluent monolayers of BHK-21 or BHK-NS1 cells; after 1 h incubation at

37°C, the inoculum was removed and washed twice with complete DMEM, twice

with PBS, then incubated in the presence of complete DMEM containing 2%

FBS; conditioned cell culture media were harvested ~18 h post-inoculation,

496

clarified as before, and stored in 1 ml aliquots at -80°C. These early harvest

497

virus stocks had very low contaminating Nluc activity that was effectively

498

removed by washing infected cells three times with PBS.

499

Virus infectivity. Infectivity measurements were determined by using plaque

500

assays or endpoint dilution assays. Plaque assays were performed as previously

501

described (89). For endpoint dilution assays with Nluc viruses, virus stocks were

502

serially diluted in half-log (√10) intervals in DMEM containing 2% FBS and

503

nonessential amino acids; each dilution was then added to BHK cells seeded in

504

96-well plates. At 24 h post-infection, cells were washed twice with complete

505

DMEM, once with PBS, and Nluc activity was measured in all wells. Wells were

506

scored positive if the Nluc activity was >2 σ from the mean of uninfected controls.

507

Tissue culture infectious dose 50% endpoint (TCID50) values were calculated by

508

using the method of Reed and Muench method, as previously described (60).

509

Nluc activity. Nluc activity was measured by using the Nano-Glo luciferase

510

assay (Promega). At indicated times in the assay, cells grown in 96-well plates

511

were gently washed twice with complete DMEM and once with PBS, then lysed

512

with 20 µl Nano-Glo luciferase assay buffer containing the substrate. Nluc activity

513

was measured from cell lysates within 10 min of lysis (or substrate addition) by

514

transferring lysate into white OptiPlate 96-well plates (PerkinElmer, Waltham,

515

MA) and measured in a Berthold Centro XS3 LB 960 luminescent plate reader

with readings integrated over 0.2 sec.

fusion inhibitor K784-9103 was purchased from ChemDiv (San Diego, CA), and

526

its structure and purity were confirmed by tandem liquid chromatography-mass

described (27). Briefly, reporter viruses were incubated in medium containing the

at room temperature to allow inhibitor to bind to virus particles before adding to

543

intravenously with 1 × 107 PFU of YFV-17D. At eighteen days post-infection, the

544

mouse was boosted intravenously with 1 × 107 PFU of YFV-17D; serum was

collected seven days following this booster injection. Serum from a female non-

tumbling. At the end of the incubation, samples were centrifuged briefly and 50 µl

553

samples were added to 3 wells of BHK cells grown in 96-well plates; Nluc

554

expression was measured after 5 h of infection.

555

Cytotoxicity assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated with

556

inhibitors at their respective experimental concentrations (indicated above) along

557

with the membrane-impermeable nuclear dye Cytotox Green (Essen BioScience

558

Inc. Ann Arbor, MI) and cell-permeable Hoechst stain (Sigma). Cytotoxicity was

559

measured on an ImageXpress Pico (Molecular Devices) by quantifying the

560

fraction of Cytox Green-positive, permeable cells among total cells.

561

Immunostaining and FACS analysis. WNVKUN and ZIKV NS1 were detected

antibody, originally raised against DENV-4 NS1 (a kind gift of Dr. Marie Flamand,

564

Institut Pasteur). Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with

565

Accumax (Innovative Cell Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA) to gently dissociate

566

cells for FACS analysis. Dissociated cells were directly fixed in paraformaldehyde

567

solution (2% (w/v) final) for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were

568

permeabilized with 0.2% saponin for ~30 min on a rotating chamber, followed by

569

two washes with PBS. Cells were incubated overnight with a 1:3000 dilution of

570

antibody 6B8-2D8 in PBS containing 2% FBS, washed with PBS, and incubated

571

with 1:1500 dilution of an anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-

572

680 fluorescent dye. Specificity of labeling was confirmed by parallel incubation

573

with the dye-conjugated secondary Ab in the absence of primary antibody, and

574

by performing the complete staining procedure on uninfected cells. At the end of

575

incubation, cells were washed twice, resuspended in PBS and subject to FACS

576

analysis to quantify the percent of NS1-positive cells by using the far-red

577

channel.
