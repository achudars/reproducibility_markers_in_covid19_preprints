Abstract. The ability to predict disease association in human genes is enhanced by an
evolutionary understanding. Importantly genes linked with heritable disease, particularly
dominant disorders, tend to have undergone duplication in our early vertebrate ancestors,
with a strong asymmetric relationship between disease-association within duplicate/paralog
pairs. Using a novel phylogenetic approach, alongside a whole-genome comparative analysis,
we show that contrary to the accepted compensatory model of disease evolution, the majority
of disease-associations reside with the more evolutionary constrained gene, inferred to most
closely resemble the progenitor. This indicates that the strong association between paralogs,
specifically ohnologs, and dominant disorders is often a consequence of a mechanism
through which pre-existing dosage sensitive/haploinsufficient genes are successfully
duplicated and retained. Heritable disease is thus as much a consequence of the fragility of
evolutionarily more ancient genes as compensatory mechanisms. From these findings, we
demonstrate the utility of a new model with which to predict disease associated genes in the
human genome.

Introduction
More than 150 years since Gregor Mendel’s findings were first published, the role of
evolution and heritability in human genetics, and specifically disease association, is still
being elucidated. We now know that whilst Mendel’s foundation of dominant versus

recessive is broadly correct, a myriad of factors can contribute to both penetrance and
severity of the resulting phenotype, but also that complex genetic interactions, where the
interplay between multiple genes results in a trait, rather than the simple ‘one gene- one trait’
model can and does occur (Cooper et al., 2013). In terms of mono-genic disease association,
a striking association has been found to exist between genes duplicated in vertebrate
evolution and disease with 80% of human heritable disease genes residing in a paralog in the
human genome (Dickerson and Robertson, 2012). Why does this strong one gene to
phenotype relationship exist with genes that have a duplication event in their history?
While ‘duplicability’ of a gene can be influenced by genomic context, such as
sequence composition and chromosomal location, leading to much of the copy number
variation observed within the human genome (Schuster-Böckler et al., 2010; Truty et al.,
2018), differential retention biases have played a significant role in the landscape of paralogs
observed in genomes (Hakes et al., 2007). Notwithstanding stochastic sampling processes in
evolution associated with smaller population sizes (Lynch and Conery, 2003), this will often
be a result of factors associated with gene product fitness. Whole genome duplication in
particular, is hypothesized to increase the chance of retention of dosage-threshold sensitive
genes, as a consequence of maintenance of stoichiometric balance (Papp et al., 2003), which,
due to negative impact on the system, would be very unlikely to be retained within the
context of small-scale duplication (SSD) events (Makino and McLysaght, 2010).
Furthermore, it has been proposed that whole-genome duplication (WGD) events confer an
immediate fitness benefit to the organism by reducing expression ‘noise’ (Pires and Conant,
2016). While copy-number associated duplicates tend to be refractory for the retention of
dosage-sensitive paralogs (Makino and McLysaght, 2010).
These studies demonstrate the imperative of having a mechanistic and evolutionary
understanding of the processes by which genes arise and are retained, in order to disentangle
the relationship between gene duplication and disease (Innan and Kondrashov, 2010; Opazo

and Zavala, 2018). Exemplifying this perspective is the strikingly strong association observed
between genes which have undergone duplication in vertebrate evolutionary history,
particularly WGDs and heritable human disease (Makino and McLysaght, 2010). Following a
‘compensation model’, where duplicates contribute to redundancy (Gu et al., 2003), we
hypothesised that this relationship was due to the accumulation of otherwise deleterious
mutations in the context of duplication events (Dickerson and Robertson, 2012), with disease
associations emerging as new genes arise and are retained, i.e., duplication introducing
disease potential by ‘masking’ of otherwise deleterious mutations. Singh et al (Singh et al.,
2012) presented a modified version of the compensation model, in which the compensation
for deleterious variation, in particular for dominant disorders, is ‘locked in’ by the WGD
event, and subsequently neither gene in the duplicate pair can be lost without severe
consequences to fitness.
What is often neglected, however, is the asymmetric relationship of disease to paralog
pairs (Dickerson and Robertson, 2012), which must be considered in any analysis. Due to
differential pressures, following a duplication event it is rarely the case that the two
paralogous genes will remain identical indefinitely. Over time the accumulation of variants in
either or both of the duplicates leads to divergence. This divergence can result in differing
functions of the two genes, sub- and neo-functionalization, or pseaudoginization amongst
others. It can also lead to disease. The relative proportions of these outcomes is a contentious
subject, with conflicting theories surrounding not only differential retention, but also the
likelihood of and degree to which evolutionary asymmetry may occur (Pachter, Lior, 2015).
Fundamentally, the discussion revolves around two arguments: the first, that paralog pairs
tend to show asymmetry where the less constrained copy is likely to be harmless to the
organism, presented by Ohno et al (Ohno, Susumu, 1970) and the second, proposed by Force
et al (Force et al., 1999) that evolution following duplication is unlikely to be asymmetric.
The current consensus agrees with Ohno’s proposition that evolutionary asymmetry does

exist (Kellis et al., 2004), although the statistical measurement employed remains contested
(Pachter, Lior, 2015), and may be dependent on the degree of dosage sensitivity within any
given paralog pair (Tasdighian et al., 2017).
In contrast to this it has been hypothesized that, following duplication, redundant
genes confer robustness through the provision of a functional paralog, which acts as a
‘buffer’ to otherwise deleterious disruptions to its partner gene (Gu et al., 2003; Hakes et al.,
2007; Hsiao and Vitkup, 2008; López-Bigas and Ouzounis, 2004; Rice and McLysaght,
2017). It is proposed that this dilution of deleteriousness permits the retention of diseaseassociated genes, which would otherwise be subject to purifying selection. Given this
‘compensation’ model, we would predict that disease-associated mutations would mostly be
found on the less constrained, longer branch within the gene pair as the relaxation of
purifying selection will permit accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations, i.e., non-lethal
disease-causing mutations (Dickerson and Robertson, 2012). Thus, explaining the connection
between paralogs and heritable disease.
Another important variable is the haploinsufficient nature of genes and its link to
dosage and disease (Veitia and Birchler, 2010), i.e., those where a single functioning copy of
the diploid gene alone is unable to support the wild-type function. Haploinsufficiency is
strongly associated with gene duplication (Kondrashov and Koonin, 2004; Papp et al., 2003;
Pires and Conant, 2016), and has generally been found to have a greater number of paralogs
than haplosufficient genes. This is likely due to the need to retain genes of this kind following
duplication events/dosage effects as they have a greater likelihood of negatively impacting on
the system, leading to stoichiometric imbalance should differential copy numbers arise
(Makino and McLysaght, 2010).
To investigate the association between evolution, the diploid nature of human genes
and human disease further, we parsed these sets of trees using a novel phylogenetic method
for gene dating and found that heritable disease genes tend to be evolutionary ancient and

associated with gene duplication, and in the case of dominant disorders this is due to WGD
being the mechanism for duplicating haploinsufficient genes. Confirming this we find
disease-associated mutations tended to fall on the shorter constrained branch in paralog pairs,
and are thus more likely to be associated with the ancestral function. We discuss these
findings and the implication that disease states are due to a pre-existing fragility within the
ancestral genome, rather than the product of later duplication events.

Results
Using a novel phylogenetic method of dating genes (SI), we were able to assign
singleton and duplicate gene ages and compare properties of disease and non-disease genes.
From this analysis, we have been able to determine that both dominant and recessive diseaseassociated genes, as identified within the OMIM database, tend to be relatively evolutionarily
ancient (Figure 1A). Significantly, the majority of these genes arose either with the two
rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD, ~441 MYA in our Euteleostomi/fish ancestors
before the split between cartilaginous and bony vertebrates) or predate them, with relatively
few disease-associated genes arising thereafter. The cumulative frequency of heritable
disease-associated genes within the human genome (Figure 1B) reveals a relative plateau in
the introduction of obviously disease-associated genes in more recent evolutionary history,
the onset of which coincides with the most recent round of WGD ~441 million years ago
(MYA). This is consistent with the proposal that there has been a relatively low rate of
disease associated gene introduction following the last round of WGD, with the majority of
disease being evolutionarily ancient.
Support for this finding of a high association between ancient genes and fragility is
provided by the results of our analysis of gene age and haploinsufficiency (HI), using the
Decipher haploinsufficiency scores (Firth et al., 2009) (Figure 2). Genes falling into the ‘true’
haploinsufficient decile, as defined by Decipher (Firth et al., 2009), are almost exclusively

genes arising at, or prior to, the most recent round of WGD (441 MYA), with only the only
outliers arising from the time-point immediately after WGD. While the seminal paper
Makino and McLysaght (2010) also looked at the link between dosage and ohnologs, they did
not directly measure this using haploinsufficiency rather assuming HI to be a property of the
ohnologs.
To test the significance of this association we investigated the relationship between
disease, haploinsufficiency, paralog status and gene age (Figure 3). The multiple
correspondence analysis (MCA) of these four features demonstrates a strong relationship
between disease, paralog status, gene age, and haploinsufficiency, in particular, for
duplicated genes with dominant disease-associations. This indicates haploinsufficiency is
providing the underlying structure of their interactions.
We tested the hypothesis that disease-association preferentially tracks to the more
diverged gene within any paralog pair. In order to do this, we parsed sets of gene trees to
establish relative branch lengths of genes in both ohnolog and SSD pairs. This novel method
provides a way of dating genes, accounting for their duplication histories by comparing
relative branch lengths and ordering of Ensembl gene families (see supplementary method).
This was further refined by establishing disparity of function by comparing associated GO
terms between genes within pairs, and subsequently refining to genes pairs with observed
functional asymmetry. Confirming our previous analysis (Dickerson and Robertson, 2012),
the majority of disease associations fall on just one of the paralogs partners (78%/1510 pairs).
while in only 433 cases (22%) are both paralogs disease associated. Contrary to expectations,
however, more of the pairs containing just one gene associated with disease associate with
the constrained, i.e., shorter branch (56%/840genes)), than the longer/evolutionary less
constrained branch (44%/710 genes) (Figure 4A) as predicted by the disease being due to
disease mutations accumulating as a consequence of relaxed selection (Dickerson and
Robertson, 2012), confirmed to be statistically significant (Chi-squared tests, P-value =2.2E-

16). This indicates that disease is often a consequence of mutations disrupting the ancestral
function, i.e., inferred to be retained by the more conserved paralog.
For the diseases associated with the conserved paralog these are over-represented for
the more haploinsufficient genes (74%), further confirming the role of haploinsufficient
genes in disease. This focus on asymmetry shows that disease propensity is most frequently
associated with a combination of both haploinsufficiency and conservation, wherein the
disease associated paralog retains a greater sequence similarity to the ancestral gene than its
partner.
When adding heritable disease type to this analysis, disease, particularly dominant
disease, being associated with the conserved branch was again the case, with more tending to
be haploinsufficient (Figures 4B & C). The major role of haploinsufficiency is supported by
gene pairs that possess a dominant disease-association only in the more diverged gene
(Dominant D, Figure 4), whilst these occur considerably less frequently than pairs whose
disease association resides in the more conserved gene, when they do, it is predominantly the
case that the disease gene also ranks more highly in the haploinsufficiency scale. Indeed there
is a highly significant trend in the increase in the number of pairs where disease is present in
only one gene, which is also both more conserved and has a greater haploinsufficiency score
(SI table S2). It must also be noted that, whilst the profiles are broadly similar in both
ohnologs (Figure 4B), and SSDs (Figure 4C) the exception is in the relative proportions of
recessive disease, which highlights the propensity of ohnologs to be more frequently
associated with dominant disorders.
These results indicate it is frequently the paralog that retains the ancestral function
that has a tendency towards fragility and therefore disease. If this is indeed the case, although
not over-represented for any disease-association (Singh et al., 2015), we would still expect to
see the same pattern for SSDs, and this is what we find (Figure 4C). As with WGDs, for
SSDs associated with dominant disorders, it is again the constrained/shorter branch that tends

to have a higher association with haploinsufficiency and, unlike WGDs, there is also a high
association with recessive disorders. This asymmetric relationship confirms that disease tends
to be associated with the more constrained/older gene function.

Discussion
Our findings demonstrate that the association between ohnologs and dominant disease
exists for the most part due to their tendency to be haploinsufficient, a feature most
commonly associated with genes arising prior to the two known WGD events in our early
vertebrate ancestors (Figure 2). The overrepresentation of disease genes within this set then
arises because WGD is the main process by which haploinsufficient genes can be both
duplicated and have a high probability of being retained. This provides an understanding of
why so many dominant diseases exist within human populations.
This is consistent with a recent study by Diss et al (Diss et al., 2017) who investigated
the impact on the system caused by the introduction of interdependent paralogs and show
differential dependence in the model organism yeast, suggesting that duplication has
introduced fragility and not increased robustness as expected. This supports the hypothesis of
equivalent divergence (and therefore absence of asymmetry) presented by Force et al (Force
et al., 1999), as disruption of interdependent subfunctions of one of the duplicated paralogs in
a subfunctionalised pair would produce a deleterious phenotype.
The evolution of complexity has been facilitated by gene duplication mechanisms,
particularly WGD events, which have facilitated the introduction of repurposable genetic
material, despite the pre-existing fragility of more evolutionarily ancient functions. Ohnologs
are a source of functional divergence (Acharya and Ghosh, 2016) as they increase the
probability of a dosage-dependent gene being retained, the later elongation of branch length
is indicative of novel function which, in terms of disease, is likely either to be associated with

complex disease or no disease. That only one of the duplicates retains dosage-sensitivity is in
line with theoretical work that incorporates retention bias due to dosage constraints (Teufel et
al., 2016).
There are, however, a small proportion of genes which, whilst likely to fit our criteria
of greater constraint and haploinsufficiency will never be observed to be disease associated.
In the case of these genes this is due to the fundamental inviability which would be
introduced as a result of their disruption, and which, as highlighted by previously observed
links between essentiality, developmental processes and ohnologs (Makino et al., 2009), are
likely to be overrepresented in genes which have resulted from a WGD event.
The significance of our finding that fragile, heritable-disease associated genes are
evolutionary more ancient can assist in a predictive capacity. This is highlighted when
applied to a newly identified disease set obtained from a recent study by Bastarache et al
(Bastarache et al., 2018), who presented a new method using phenotype risk scores to
identify novel Mendelian disease variants. They identified 18 variants in 16 genes leading to
monogenic disorders. Using these genes as a test set, we predicted that they would
predominantly be duplicates, and that those duplicates would have greater haploinsufficiency
and shorter branch length when compared with their paralog partner. We found that of the 16
genes, 12 were duplicates: 9 ohnologs (from varying stringency criteria) and 3 SSDs
(supplementary results table S2). Within this set, five of the newly-established disease genes
had both the shortest branch length and highest haploinsufficiency scores, three had the
shortest branch length and lowest haploinsufficiency scores, three had the longest branch
length and highest haploinsufficiency scores, and only one gene had the longest branch and
lowest haploinsufficiency score. This validates our finding that disease is most commonly
associated with the more conserved gene in a pair. However, in cases where it is the
divergent gene that is associated with disease, this is almost always the gene with a greater
haploinsufficiency score.

By expanding our understanding of haploinsufficiency and paralog-associated disease
asymmetry within duplicated gene pairs, we have demonstrated that the observed enrichment
of dominant disease-association is an artifact of pre-existing haploinsufficiency and any
subsequent disease states are due to this, rather than the somewhat counterintuitive
hypothesis that it is dominant disease-association, so-called dangerousness, which leads to
retention (Singh et al., 2012). It should be noted that the second round of WGD (Acharya and
Ghosh, 2016) will add at least one additional disease-associated gene, so ohnologs do also
add disease-prone genes to the genome. These haploinsufficient duplicates, which can persist
due to the initial presence of a functionally identical partner, are then able to evolve away
from their haploinsufficient disease-associated state. A high abundance of haploinsufficient
disease-associated genes were already extant in the ancestral genome, and what we observe
within ohnologs is an increase in genes with an on-going reduction in potential for
monogenic disease associations compared with the pre-WGD genome.
In conclusion, the ancestral role of the progenitor genes was likely the provision of
relatively more ‘core’ functions common to most life, which leads to the observed
associations with haploinsufficiency, essentiality and, as a consequence, a tendency towards
fragility, all of which are traits passed on to their duplicated ‘daughters’. The lack of obvious
disease-association in more recent evolutionary history will be a consequence of a reduction
in the importance of any one specific gene in the context of greater functional complexity.

Methods
Allocation of evolutionary ages to genes
To obtain the gene ages, the Ensembl IDs and gene types of all known genes were
obtained from Ensembl (release 88, genome GRCh38) (Zerbino et al., 2018) with R (version
3.3.3) (R Core Team, 2016) using the biomaRt R package (version 2.28) (Durinck et al.,
2009). The known gene IDs were used by a Perl script running on ActivePerl (version 5.20.2)

that saved the approximate taxon age and relative phylogenetic branch length (based on
protein sequence similarity) of all the speciation and duplication events for every known gene
with a gene tree in Ensembl Compara, starting with each gene’s leaf node and recursively
saving all the ancestor events in the gene’s tree up to the root event (SI Figure). The known
gene IDs were grouped into paralog families using biomaRt and, together with the gene tree
event ages and branch lengths, formed the input to a C# program (Microsoft Visual Studio
Enterprise 2015, .NET version 4.6.2) that implements the FFS algorithm.
To obtain duplicate gene ages an algorithm, furthest from source, FFS, was devised.
First the approach removes all speciation events apart from those at the start of gene histories
and all duplication events marked as ‘dubious’, preserving the phylogenetic branch lengths
from the removed events by adding them to the next youngest event. The gene tree events for
each paralog family’s genes were then used to create a human-specific paralog tree, started
by merging the oldest event (common to all genes in the family) from each gene’s event
history and then continued by merging events where identical in age and branch length and
branching otherwise. Non-bifurcating duplication events were then removed from the humanspecific paralog trees, again preserving the removed events’ branch lengths by adding them
to the next youngest event. This method of tree building recreates the human-specific
duplication topology of the paralog family in Ensembl Compara, preserving branch lengths
while removing events unnecessary for the allocation of duplication ages to genes.
The ages of the root node and internal duplication nodes in each paralog tree were then
assigned to the gene leaf nodes according to the following algorithm, with node distances
comprising the cumulative branch lengths between the node in question and the root node:
while there are genes in the paralog tree without ages...
set the subject to be the undated gene furthest from the root
for each duplication from the subject’s ancestor back up to the root...
if the duplication has undated genes with shorter distance to root...
subject takes the duplication's age

if subject is still undated...
subject takes the root’s age

This algorithm has the effect of assigning ages from duplications to genes such that a
gene’s FFS-assigned age is influenced by the degree of protein sequence similarity between
the gene and the inferred ancestral gene at the root of the paralog tree. The root
duplication/speciation node’s age is assigned to two genes in contrast to internal duplication
nodes’ ages which are assigned to exactly one extant leaf gene node (triplication node ages
would be assigned to two gene nodes, etc). In addition to paralog similarity to the inferred
ancestral sequence, FFS takes account of all duplications in a paralog family. A small number
of genes were found, wherein there had been no divergence since their most recent shared
duplication event, these genes were defined as ambiguous and omitted from the current
analysis.
The FFS approach also emits the IDs, names and gene-to-parent branch lengths of the
‘terminal paralog pairs’, defined as the gene pairs that have a duplication as their parent node.
For each terminal paralog pair, the normalised branch length asymmetry was calculated as
the difference in branch lengths of the pair divided by the maximum gene distance to root in
each paralog family (so that the asymmetries could be compared across all paralog families).

Disease status, paralog status, and haplosufficiency
In addition to gene ages, data was gathered pertaining to disease association, gene age
and paralog status of all ‘known’ genes. Data analysis was performed using a combination of
Perl 5, version 18, subversion 2 (v5.18.2) (Wall, 2000) and R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31) (R
Core Team, 2016).
Paralog status was calculated by cross-referencing output from the FFS approach with
data pertaining to whole genome duplication status obtained from Singh et al (Singh et al.,
2015) on 19/03/2018. It was decided when restricting to ‘ohnologs’ alone, to only include
gene pairs which fulfilled the ‘strict’ criteria, having q-scores for both self-comparison, and

outgroup of <0.01 (ibid), as these provide the clearest distinction between ohnolog and nonohnolog genes in the human genome.
The FFS-dated genes were subsequently partitioned into paralog status based on their
individual history of duplication, and presence in the ‘strict’, ‘intermediate’ or ‘relaxed’
synteny-based ohnolog lists. Those with an additional duplication event more recent than the
second WGD event at 441mya were defined as ‘[ohnolog-type]/SSD’. Genes without any
duplication events in their history were defined as ‘singleton’ and the remaining duplicated
genes, not yet assigned a duplication type, were designated as ‘SSD’.
Data pertaining to disease association were obtained from OMIM in the form of the
Genemap2

dataset

(https://data.omim.org/downloads/dI1aeTBYTNet3PfqZqIS_w/genemap2.txt) obtained on
1/5/2018. Information contained therein used in the current analysis was compiled by OMIM
from the following sources: Ensembl gene id –Ensembl; Phenotype data – OMIM. A textbased search was performed on this file to establish, firstly, if each gene in our ‘known’ set
existed within the OMIM dataset, and if so, whether their association was with dominant,
recessive or unknown disease inheritance, subsequent assignment of disease status was
conducted according to these findings. For rare instances where genes had both dominant and
recessive associations their status was defined as ‘both’ and genes in the ‘known’ list, not
present in Genemap2, were defined as ‘none’.
Haploinsufficiency (HI) scores (Huang et al., 2010) were obtained from Decipher (Firth
et al., 2009) (Haploinsufficiency Predictions Version 3 bed file) on 10/03/2018. Due to the
fact that the entries in this file listed genes using HGNC identifiers, to bring them in line with
the Ensembl naming convention used in the analysis it was necessary to cross reference gene
names with their Ensembl counterparts. To this end Ensembl GRCh38.p7 gene names and
HGNC IDs were obtained from Ensembl BioMart (Zerbino et al., 2018) on 03/05/2018, and,
where possible HGNC IDs substituted in the Haploinsufficiency data, for Ensembl gene IDs.

Haplosufficiency scores and ranks were then obtained for each ‘known’ gene. A consolidated
dataset was then created (Data S1), containing Ensembl gene name, disease status, paralog
status and both haplosufficiency score and rank, which provided the basis for the initial
analysis of gene age, paralog status, disease status and haplosufficiency.
In order to investigate asymmetry the initial dataset was expanded. Four further datasets
were compiled from data obtained the above sources, specifically pertaining to genes in the
differing types of duplication pairs, including genes identified as [ohnolog]SSDs as [ohnologtype] (Data S3:S5), and the other pertaining to genes in terminal paralog pairs (Data S2). For
these files comparisons were made on a per pair basis. Each gene in the pair was named
Conserved ‘C’ or Diverged ‘D’, where gene C had the shortest distance to root, and was
therefore considered the most conserved, and gene D the greatest distance, and therefore
considered the most diverged. Disease association per pair was then calculated, and disease
associations previously listed as ‘both’ were considered dominant.
To validate the asymmetry between the pairs functional dissimilarity was calculated and
added to the data. In order to do this the complete list of human GO terms was downloaded
from the gene ontology consortium ((Ashburner et al., 2000), 31/10/2018), these were then
stored for each gene, and compared between genes in each pair. For each term not present in
the other gene the functional divergence score was increased by one. Any pairs with a score
of less than one was considered not to exhibit true asymmetry, and therefore dropped from
the asymmetry data.
