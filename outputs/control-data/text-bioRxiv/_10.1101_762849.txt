Background: Malaria vector control and research rely heavily on monitoring mosquito

16

populations for the development of resistance to public health insecticides. One

17

standard method for determining susceptibility in adult mosquito populations is the

18

World Health Organization test (WHO bioassay). The WHO bioassay kit consists of

19

several acrylic pieces that are assembled into a unit. Parts of the kit commonly break,

20

reducing the capacity of insectaries to carry out resistance profiling. Since there is at

21

present only a single supplier for the test kits, replacement parts can be hard to procure

22

in a timely fashion. Here, we present 3D printable versions for all pieces of the WHO

23

bioassay kit. Results: Using widely available polylactic acid (PLA) filament as a

24

printing material, we were able to design and print functional replacements for each

25

piece of the WHO bioassay kit. We note no significant difference in mortality results

26

obtained from PLA printed tubes and WHO acrylic tubes. Additionally, we observed

27

no degradation of PLA in response to prolonged exposure times of commonly used

28

cleaning solutions. Conclusions: Our designs can be used to produce replacement

29

parts for the WHO bioassay kit in any facility with a 3D printer, which are becoming

30

increasingly widespread. 3D printing technologies can affordably and rapidly address

31

equipment shortages and be used to develop bespoke equipment in laboratories.

Background

37

Malaria remains a critical public health problem across sub-Saharan Africa, with vector

38

control — a vital part of efforts to control and eradicate malaria — relying heavily on

39

efficacious insecticides [1]. Widespread and emerging resistance poses a significant

40

threat to public health and is reflected by increased efforts to understand and

41

characterize the distribution of resistant mosquito populations and associated genetic

42

variants across endemic regions of Africa [2, 3].

43
44

The World Health Organization insecticide susceptibility test (WHO bioassay) is a

45

standard method implemented to assess resistance in adult mosquito populations.

46

During this test, mosquitoes are held in one of two tubes (Fig. 1a), either lined with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/762849; this version posted September 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

47

untreated paper (control) or insecticide-impregnated paper (exposure) held in place

48

with spring clips (Fig. 1c). Both tubes are separated by a slide unit (Fig. 1e) and slide

49

(Fig. 1f), while the ends of the tubes are capped with a screen mesh (Fig. 1b) and

50

screw cap (Fig. 1a). Mosquitoes are held in the insecticide tube for one hour, and the

51

percentage mortality of exposed mosquitoes 24 hours post-exposure is a

52

measurement for insecticide susceptibility [4]. A single experimental unit for the WHO

53

bioassay kit is comprised of 2 mesh screens, two screw caps, two tubes, four spring

54

clips, one slide unit, one slide (Fig. 1).

55
56

Certain parts of the WHO bioassay kit are more liable to become worn, damaged or

57

lost, causing a reduced capacity of insectaries to conduct bioassays. Most notably, in

58

our experience, the mesh screen can become easily lost or damaged during cleaning;

59

the slide unit is subject to friction from the slide and when combined with the gradual

60

weakening of the chemical bond through repeated uses and washes, frequently splits;

61

and springs are lost during washing procedures. Long shipping times and associated

62

costs mean that replacing lost or damaged parts can become economically or

63

logistically unviable. To address these problems, we used computer-aided design

64

software to produce 3D printable versions of the parts that comprise the WHO

65

bioassay kit.

66
67

Accurate, reliable and affordable 3D printing technologies are now commercially

68

available. The most common 3D printer form utilizes a Cartesian axis system to control

69

the deposition of molten plastic filament onto a print surface, in a process called fused

70

filament fabrication (FFF). Many different plastics and materials can be used for 3D

71

printing, such as polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), nylon,

72

polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PET-G) and polycarbonate. PLA is widely available

73

and is suitable for use in most laboratory plastic equipment. Indeed, 3D printing

74

technologies are increasingly being used in research settings [5]. The glass transition

75

temperature of PLA is 60 - 65oC with a melting temperature of ~180oC, meaning in

76

cold or low-temperature settings PLA is thermally stable.

77
78

Here, we present 3D printable replacement parts for the WHO bioassay kit which print

79

without the need for tools or glue; and which interface with existing WHO bioassay

80

parts. We discuss the design challenges, modifications from existing WHO bioassay

81

kits and files needed to print replacement parts for the WHO bioassay kit.

82
83

Methods

84

Designing 3D models

85

We used SketchUp (Trimble Inc.) and OpenSCAD (Marius Kintel, Openscad.org) to

86

create the 3D model files in the stereolithography (STL) format needed to enable 3D

87

printing of parts. Some parts were technically difficult or impossible to directly replicate

88

using current FFF 3D-printing. In these cases, we modified the existing design to allow

89

printing, while retaining the same physical function.

90
91

Support material is plastic printed alongside the desired part to prevent necessary

92

plastic overhangs from dropping below their intended position. This support material

93

is printed in such a way that it is easily detached from the finished piece; however, its

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/762849; this version posted September 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

available under aCC-BY-NC 4.0 International license.

94

inclusion leads to longer print times and higher plastic consumption. Around the

95

circumference of the tube, two rims are present to provide a positive stop for when the

96

tubes are fully inserted into the slide unit. On the original WHO bioassay tube, these

97

rims are squared on the edges, replicating this feature would require support material

98

during printing. To reduce print time, plastic consumption and potential interference

99

with tube threads, the outer geometry of the rim was changed to triangular. This

100

geometry can be printed without any lower support while retaining the function of the

101

original part.

102
103

The slide unit has an internal section into which the gate slides. This geometry is

104

complex; indeed, the original part is manufactured in two halves and chemically

105

bonded together. The concept for this project required that the entire system be 3D

106

printable, to increase accessibility and use. To be practically printable, this part needed

107

adapting for 3D printing. Like the WHO bioassay slide unit, we created two halves and

108

developed a method of bonding the pieces together. We designed a sliding clip

109

method of joining two screw flanges of the slide unit. Two halves of the slide unit are

110

printed with the addition of arrow-like notches on each side; these interface with a

111

sliding lock clip that mechanically locks the two halves together and creates a gap for

112

the gate to slide through (Fig. 1g, h, i).

113
114

On the inside of the slide unit are two friction nodules (Fig. 1h) that retain the slide in

115

either the closed or open position, preventing the slide from falling out of the slide unit

116

during handling. To address this, we designed the whole slide unit to include front clips

117

that retain the friction nodules. These changes now necessitate some assembly of the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/762849; this version posted September 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

118

slide unit once printed. However, the slide unit has been designed to allow hand-

119

assembly without the need for tools. Despite the changes to this part of the WHO

120

bioassay kit and the increase in physical size, the mechanical function remains the

121

same.

122
123

The mesh screen used at the end of the tubes is manufactured from a flexible material

124

that allows it to have no border. In our prototyping, we found that printed mesh screens

125

were too weak to be handled when printed without a border. Therefore, a 3mm border

126

was added to the CAD version of the mesh – this does not extend past the lip of the

127

screw cap, retaining the same function as the original.

128
129

3D Printing

130

3D printing was carried out on an Original Prusa i3 MK3 and an MK3S (Prusa

131

Research) modified with a BuildTak print surface (https://www.buildtak.eu/), using

132

white 1.75mm PLA filament (ZIRO3D). Designed CAD models were exported as STL

133

files. STL files must be converted to machine instructions following the G-code

134

standard to be processed by 3D printers. This conversion process is called slicing.

135

The STL model files were sliced using Cura 3.3.1 (Ultimaker) with the following key

136

slicer settings: 100% infill, two shells/perimeters.

137
138

Reliably and efficiently 3D printing transparent objects is technically difficult with

139

commercially-available 3D printers and typically results in a cloudy translucent finish.

140

During prototyping, we identified that bright white filament – though not transparent –

141

provides enough contrast for mosquitoes to be easily counted while viewing through

142

the mesh screen. Commercially available WHO bioassay tubes use a green and red

143

dot to denote both the holding and exposure side the bioassay kit, respectively. We

144

used a permanent marker to label the corresponding printed parts with an ‘E’

145

(exposure) and ‘H’ (holding) (Fig. 2).

146
147

Bioassay testing

148

To ensure that the 3D printed tubes performed in a similar manner to the acrylic tubes

149

we performed susceptibility testing using standard 4% WHO diagnostic dose of

150

dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) insecticide on two Kenyan laboratory strains of

151

Anopheles gambiae s.s. (Kilifi and Mbita). Batches of ~25 3 – 5 day old female

152

mosquitoes, were exposed in each tube. The number of replicate exposures was as

153

follows: Kilifi WHO tubes n=10, Kilifi 3D tubes n=11, Mbita WHO tubes n=7, Mbita 3D

154

tubes n=7. Percentage mortality was recorded after the 24-hour holding period. All

155

mosquito rearing was conducted at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine

156

insectaries, following standard operating procedures. The Mbita strain was collected

157

at Mbita Point, Kenya in 1999, and has been maintained as a laboratory strain since

158

this time. The Kilifi strain was collected in the Kilifi County, Kenya in 2012. The colony

159

is maintained by both the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and Kenya Medical

160

Research Institute.

PLA reactivity with bioassay solutions

163

To assess whether the PLA would interact with solutions that are commonly used

164

during the bioassay protocol, we exposed PLA parts to 4 different solutions to observe

165

any degradation of the plastic. (1) Cotton pads soaked with 10% sucrose solution,

screens for seven days. Cotton pads were soaked daily with fresh 10% sucrose

solution to replace evaporated solution. (2) Four slides were submerged in 3%

169

Rely+On Virkon (Lanxess) for five days. (3) Four slides were submerged in 5% Decon

Bioassays with 4% DDT using the Mbita and Kilifi strains showed no significant

182

difference in 24-hour mortality (Figure 3) for measurements between 3D printed and

WHO bioassay kits. We also observed that mosquitoes can sugar feed through the 3D

184

printed mesh screens.

187

After exposure to 10% sucrose, 70% ethanol, 3% Rely+On Virkon (Lanxess) and 5%

Decon 90 (Decon Laboratories Ltd.), we observed no signs of degradation of the PLA

191

Discussion

192

We have developed, and provide here, printable versions of all pieces that compose

193

a WHO bioassay kit. We see the primary use case for these parts as a replacement

194

library for missing and damaged parts of an original WHO bioassay kit. Bioassay data

195

for DDT exposure indicate no significant difference between 3D printed and WHO

196

bioassay kits; although, other insecticides/strain combinations may react differently

197

when interacting with 3D printed materials. Anecdotally, in our insectaries, we find that

198

the most in-demand 3D printed replacement parts are the slide unit and mesh screen,

199

with tubes being the most durable parts and least likely to be needed.

200
201

The design challenges of 3D printing the WHO bioassay kit necessitated some

202

changes to the geometry of individual parts. Most notably, to retain all functionality,

203

the 3D printable slide unit had to be printed as six individual pieces that are assembled.

204

In addition to showing no functional differences during operation and manual handling,

205

because the 3D printed slide unit does not use chemical bonding, it is more durable to

206

general wear and less likely to become damaged, in terms of splitting. Though, we do

207

note that when using PLA as a 3D printing material, operators must be cognizant of

208

the effect of hot temperatures causing material deformation.

211

We present files that allow printing of all parts of the WHO bioassay kit. To achieve

212

this, we replicated existing parts in CAD software, modifying and adapting the designs

213

where necessary to permit 3D printing. The printed parts interface with standard WHO

214

bioassay kits and in the case of full 3D printed kits, produce results not significantly

215

different from standard WHO bioassay kits. 3D printing in laboratory environments has

216

become more achievable thanks to the continued reduction in costs and developments

217

in 3D printing technologies. Through the distribution of the 3D printable laboratory

218

equipment, researchers can maintain testing capacity, reduce costs and adapt

219

apparatus for bespoke purposes.
