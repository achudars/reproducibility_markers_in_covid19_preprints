Abstract
Prodromal positive psychotic symptoms and anxiety are two strong risk factors for schizophrenia in
22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). The analysis of large-scale brain network dynamics during rest is
promising to investigate aberrant brain function and identify potentially more reliable biomarkers. We retrieved and examined dynamics of large-scale functional brain networks using innovation-driven co-activation
patterns (iCAPs) and probed into functional signatures of prodromal psychotic symptoms and anxiety. Patients with 22q11DS had shorter activation in cognitive brain networks and longer activation in emotion
processing networks. Functional signatures of prodromal psychotic symptoms confirmed an implication of
cingulo-prefrontal salience network activation duration and coupling. Functional signatures of anxiety uncovered an implication of amygdala activation and coupling, indicating differential roles of dorsal and ventral
sub-divisions of anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices. These results confirm that the dynamic
nature of brain network activation contains essential function to develop clinically relevant imaging markers
of psychosis vulnerability.

Introduction
Schizophrenia is a strongly debilitating mental disorder both for affected individuals and in terms of
societal cost (35, 31). Converging evidence suggests that schizophrenia is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder, given that in most cases, sub-clinical psychiatric and cognitive symptoms of the disorder are
present several years prior to the onset of a full-blown psychotic episode (35, 30, 45, 53, 73, 100). The neurodevelopmental model critically implies that earlier interventions might prove more effective in preventing
the progression towards psychosis (53, 59). Hence extensive research has been devoted to characterizing the
prodromal disease stage, also known as psychosis High-Risk State (30). In particular, clinical research has
demonstrated that the presence of attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, operationalized in the UltraHigh-Risk criteria (99), confers a strongly increased 30-40% risk of developing psychosis (29). While current
clinical management is based purely on clinical observation (63, 81), the identification of biomarkers of early
psychosis could improve our understanding of the pathophysiology in its earliest disease stage (38). In this
sense, the addition of imaging markers to the existing clinical diagnostic tools could allow the establishment
of more precise biomarker-informed stages in the evolution of psychosis, which would give way to more
targeted and effective therapeutic strategies and improved clinical outcomes (35, 59, 38).
Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder coming with a
highly elevated risk for schizophrenia with a 30%-40% prevalence by adulthood (83). Most patients with
22q11DS are diagnosed already during childhood, which allows to characterize the earliest stages of schizophrenia’s disease course (35, 6). Similarly to the general population the presence of attenuated psychotic symptoms strongly increases the risk of psychosis in 22q11DS pointing to a common clinical trajectory with
non-syndromic schizophrenia (82). Moreover, anxiety has emerged as another strong risk factor for psychosis in 22q11DS (32, 33). These clinical findings point to the particular importance of understanding the
pathophysiology and characterizing biomarkers of attenuated psychotic symptoms and anxiety in 22q11DS.
Among the tools to characterize biomarkers, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has emerged as promising (78). FMRI provides the unique opportunity to non-invasively observe
brain function, and the resting condition is especially well-suited in clinical populations because it requires
minimal compliance from participants. Most studies on rs-fMRI in psychosis to date have used static
functional connectivity (sFC); i.e., the correlation between the activation in different brain regions over the
whole scanning time (91). However, a limitation of such static approaches is that they ignore the inherently
dynamic nature of brain activity with potentially valuable information contained in dynamic changes of
activation and connectivity over the scanning duration (11, 12, 71, 34, 43). In this perspective, dynamic

approaches have the potential to identify more precise and more reliable biomarkers, and are particularly
promising in schizophrenia, given the multiplicity of affected behavioral domains and brain circuits (10, 8, 24,
92, 91). Studies on dynamic brain function in schizophrenia point towards disrupted dynamic connectivity
between several brain states, in particular of subcortico-cortical connectivity (15) and connections of the
default mode network (DMN; 19, 60, 87, 75). The few studies to date investigating dynamic FC (dFC) in
individuals at clinical high risk found reduced dFC of salience network (SN) and DMN (67) and stronger
alterations in early schizophrenia patients than subjects at ultra high risk (18). These results underline the
potential of dynamic brain function to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology in subjects at risk
for schizophrenia.
Despite these promises of dynamic fMRI analysis, functional neuroimaging research in 22q11DS has so
far mostly focused on static functional features (17, 80, 54, 84, 55), often targeting only specific functional
networks such as the DMN (66, 85). The studies who explicitly investigated psychotic symptoms in 22q11DS
showed correlations of DMN dysconnectivity with prodromal psychotic symptoms (17), as well as successful
discrimination between patients at high vs. low risk based whole-brain rs-fMRI (80) and hypoconnectivity
of DMN, SN, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and frontoparietal network (FPN; 84). Further, in the
only two studies to date investigating a dynamic feature of brain function in 22q11DS – the variability of
blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals – we found widespread reductions in brain variability
in 22q11DS (102), and reduced variability in the dorsal ACC in patients with higher prodromal psychotic
symptoms (101). In general, aberrant function, but also structure of the ACC has been suggested as a
neuroimaging marker for the development of psychosis in 22q11DS (65) and might reflect dysfunctional
self-monitoring and salience processing, possible mechanisms for the emergence of psychosis (37).
There are multiple methods to investigate dynamic fMRI (71), many of which have already been applied in
schizophrenia as outlined above (10, 18). In sliding-window dFC, changes in FC are extracted by computing
FC in a temporal window that is shifted over time (11, 75). This method has also been extended to
compute dFC between independent components obtained from independent component analysis (ICA).
These approaches, however, are limited by the necessity to choose the window size, and are only able to detect
relatively slow changes in FC (48). Alternatively, so-called first-order approaches rely on temporal clustering
of fMRI frames to obtain patterns of co-activity, so-called “co-activation patterns” (CAPs) (50). Here, no
minimum activation duration of a brain state needs to be specified, which allows to trace even fast changes
is brain states. However, only one brain state (or CAP) can be active at a time point. To overcome these
limitations, the recently introduced innovation-driven co-activation patterns (iCAPs) framework detects

moments of significantly changing brain activity to extract large-scale brain networks and their dynamic
properties (41, 43, 103). In other words, brain networks are retrieved from dynamic activation changes,
rather than activation itself. In this way, the iCAPs framework allows to robustly retrieve spatially and
temporally overlapping brain networks. Furthermore, it incorporates deconvolution of the hemodynamic
response function as a prerequesite to network extraction, which makes it robust towards noise.
In this study, we complement the existing literature on dFC in schizophrenia by using iCAPs combined
with multivariate pattern analysis to identify potential biomarkers for psychosis vulnerability in 22q11DS.
We detect functional fingerprints of anxiety and positive prodromal symptoms, two symptoms that have
emerged as reliable predictors of psychosis in 22q11DS (33, 82).

Results
Demographic characteristics
Table 1 shows demographic characteristics of the 78 patients with 22q11DS and 85 healthy controls (HCs)
that were included in the current study. There were no significant differences in age, gender distribution and
handedness of the two groups. IQ was significantly lower in patients with 22q11DS (p<0.001). Amongst
patients, 55% met the criteria for one or multiple psychiatric diagnoses, while HCs were selected based on
the absence of such diagnoses.
Extracted spatial maps correspond to known resting-state networks
We applied the iCAPs framework to rs-fMRI scans of all subjects, including both HCs and patients
with 22q11DS. We identified 17 iCAPs corresponding to well-known resting-state networks (see Figure 1
and Supplementary Table S2). See Materials and Methods for details on iCAPs analysis and the definiting of the optimum number of networks based on consensus clustering (62) (see also Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). The obtained networks included sensory-related networks such as primary visual (PrimVIS1
and PrimVIS2; iCAP1 and iCAP8), secondary visual (SecVIS, iCAP2), auditory/sensorimotor (AUD/SM,
iCAP13) and sensorimotor (SM, iCAP6) networks. The default mode network (DMN) was decomposed
into anterior (aDMN, iCAP10), posterior (pDMN, iCAP11) and precuneus/ventral DMN (PREC/vDMN,
iCAP7). There were two attention-related iCAPs; i.e., fronto-parietal network (FPN, iCAP9) and visuospatial network (VSN, iCAP12). Two iCAPs included regions commonly considered as the salience network:
the anterior insula (aIN, iCAP3) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex together with dorso-lateral prefrontal

orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, iCAP16) and prefrontal cortex (PFC, iCAP17).
Patients with 22q11DS show altered activation and coupling of iCAPs
Our first objective was to probe into alterations of the identified networks’ temporal properties in patients
with 22q11DS. First, we investigated in which networks patients with 22q11DS had aberrant activation
duration. Then, given the neurodevelopmental nature of 22q11DS, we tested whether these alterations
might be related to aberrant development with age. Finally, we looked further into aberrant coupling
duration between networks, which was assessed as positive coupling duration (same-signed co-activation
between two iCAPs) or anti-coupling duration (differently-signed co-activation between two iCAPs).

Altered duration of iCAPs’ activation
Figure 2 shows duration for all 17 iCAPs in percentage of total non-motion scanning time. Median
total activation time ranged from 34.36 % for LAN (4) to 1.54 % for PFC (17). Patients with 22q11DS had
significantly shorter activation of dACC/dlPFC (5), PrimVIS2 (8), FPN (9), aDMN (10) and pDMN (11)
and significantly longer activation of SM (6), iTEMP/FUS (14), AMY/HIP (15) and OFC (16).
Relationship between age and duration of iCAPs’ activation
To assess the association between age and duration of iCAPs’ activation we conducted Partial Least
Squares Correlation (PLSC; 46) – a technique that provides multivariate association between variables.
PLSC is based on the extraction of principal components of correlation between a set of behavioral measures
and a set of brain activation measures. It results in correlation components that are associated with brain
and behavior weights indicating the contribution of each respective measure to the multivariate correlation
(see Materials and Methods for more details).
We conducted PLSC with age as behavioral variable and duration of the nine altered iCAPs (figure 2) as
brain variables. There was one significant correlation component (p=0.04) showing an opposite age-effect in
HCs and patients with 22q11DS (age-weights: −0.44±0.2 in HCs, 0.89±0.21 in 22q11DS, see Supplementary
Figure S3). In three networks (dACC/dlPFC - 5, PrimVIS2 - 8, FPN - 9), we found declining duration
with age in patients with 22q11DS, but increasing duration with age in HCs. These three iCAPs had also
globally shorter activation in 22q11DS. Contrarily, two networks (iTEMP/FUS - 14, AMY/HIP - 15) had
increasing duration with age in 22q11DS and declining duration with age in HCs. Both of these networks
had also globally longer activation in 22q11DS. Together, these results suggest that the alterations in these

five networks are emerging over age in patients with 22q11DS.
Alterations in temporal coupling of networks
To go beyond pure investigation of activation, we next probed into alterations of brain network interactions. Specifically, we analyzed the duration of positive coupling (co-activation with same sign) or
anti-coupling (co-activation with opposite sign) between between all pair-wise combinations of iCAPs. Figure 3 shows significant group differences in iCAPs’ coupling. For several networks the duration of coupling
was longer in patients with 22q11DS than in controls. This was true for 6 positive couplings and 13 anticouplings. Fewer networks had shorter duration of coupling in patients with 22q11DS (1 positive coupling,
5 anti-couplings). Globally, alterations were more numerous for anti-couplings (25 in total) than for positive
couplings (6 in total).
Functional signature of positive psychotic symptoms
In order to investigate the behavioral relevance of this aberrant activation and coupling in 22q11DS, we
conducted behavior PLSC including positive symptoms items deducted from the Structured Interview of
Prodromal Symptoms (SIPS; 61). We first investigated iCAPs’ activation duration, followed by a second

PLSC further testing for the implications of positive couplings and anti-couplings of the dACC/dlPFC (5)
network.
Altered iCAPs’ duration is associated with psychotic symptoms in patients with 22q11DS
PLSC analysis including positive SIPS items and iCAPs’ activation duration of the nine altered iCAPs
(see figure 2) resulted in one significant correlation component (p=0.05, see figure 4A). The duration of
dACC/dlPFC (5), FPN (9) and iTEMP/FUS (14) was positively correlated with all five positive psychotic
symptoms.
Altered couplings of dACC/dlPFC are associated with psychotic symptoms in patients with 22q11DS
Next, we investigated the relevance of couplings for psychotic symptoms. For this, we selected the
dACC/dlPFC (5) network based on its appearance in the previous analysis (see previous paragraph “Altered
iCAPs’ duration is associated with psychotic symptoms in patients with 22q11DS”), as well as literature
associating ACC alterations with psychosis in 22q11DS (65). We included coupling time of dACC/dlPFC (5)
with iCAPs that had altered couplings (iCAPs 3, 13, 14 and 15; see figure 3) and with iCAPs whose duration
was significantly correlated with psychotic symptoms (iCAPs 9 and 14; see figure 4A).
We first conducted a PLSC for anti-coupling time between dACC/dlPFC (5) and these networks and
found one significant correlation component (p=0.02, see figure 4B) showing an association between higher
positive symptoms and longer anti-coupling of dACC/dlPFC (5) with FPN (9) and iTEMP/FUS (14). Thus,
not only the activation of dACC/dlPFC (5) by itself is associated with higher symptoms severity, but also
its interaction with other networks, namely its anti-coupling time with FPN (9) and iTEMP/FUS (14).
A second PLSC analysis for positive coupling time between dACC/dlPFC (5) and these networks did
not give any significant correlation component (p=0.58).
Functional signature of anxiety
Finally, we conducted similar analyses to investigate dynamic brain network alterations associated with
anxiety, another behavioral risk factor for psychosis in 22q11DS besides prodromal symptoms. Anxiety
scores were obtained from the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) (1) in children, and the Adult Behavioral Checklist (ABCL) in adults (see also Materials and Methods). Again, we first probed into iCAPs’
activation duration, followed by a further analysis of positive couplings and anti-couplings – this time of the
AMY/HIP (15) network.

anti-couplings of dACC/dlPFC (5) that were altered in 22q11DS. Longer anti-coupling of dACC/dlPFC (5) with FPN (9)
and iTEMP/FUS (14) is associated with higher positive symptoms. Error bars indicate bootstrapping 5th to 95th percentiles,
robust results were indicated by yellow background. Exact values of bootstrap mean and 5-95 percentiles are reported in
Supplementary Table S5. PLSC results for positive couplings were not significant (p=0.6) and are thus not reported here.

Altered iCAPs’ duration is associated with anxiety in patients with 22q11DS and HCs
We performed PLSC analysis between CBCL/ABCL anxiety scores in 22q11DS and HCs and iCAPs’
duration, again including the nine iCAPs with altered duration (see figure 2). There was one significant
correlation component (p=0.03, see figure 5A). Both in HCs and patients with 22q11DS, longer activation of
PrimVIS2 (8), iTEMP/FUS (14) and AMY/HIP (15) and shorter activation of aDMN (10) were associated
with higher anxiety.
Altered couplings of AMY/HIP are associated with anxiety in patients with 22q11DS
To further investigate coupling effects related to anxiety, we conducted PLSC for coupling time of
AMY/HIP (15). We have chosen to focus on this network because its duration was related to anxiety
in the previous analysis (see previous paragraph “Altered iCAPs’ duration is associated with anxiety in
patients with 22q11DS and HCs”) and because of the involvement of these brain regions in anxiety, which
is well established in the literature (22). We included coupling time of AMY/HIP (15) with iCAPs that
had altered couplings (iCAPs 4, 5, 7 and 9; see figure 3) and with iCAPs whose duration was significantly

associated with anxiety (iCAPs 10 and 14; see figure 5A).
In the first PLSC analysis, testing for anti-couplings between AMY/HIP (15) and these networks, there
was no significant correlation component (p=0.07).
The second PLSC analysis included positive couplings between AMY/HIP (15) and these networks and
resulted in one significant correlation component (p=0.006, see figure 5B). Behavior weights were only
robust for patients with 22q11DS, indicating that the corresponding pattern of correlations given by the
correlation weights was specific for patients. Longer positive coupling of AMY/HIP (15) with LAN (4) and
dACC/dlPFC (5) was positively associated with anxiety, whereas positive coupling with aDMN (10) was negatively associated with anxiety. Again, these results indicate that not only the activation of AMY/HIP (15)
is related to anxiety, but also its coupling with other networks.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated dynamic features of network brain activity in patients with 22q11DS, with
a particular focus on the identification of functional signatures of prodromal psychotic symptoms and anxiety, two behavioral risk factors for the transition to psychosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study to investigate dynamics of large-scale functional brain networks in 22q11DS. We used iCAPs to go
beyond static functional connectivity analysis and look into precise moments of brain network activation and
interaction, which is particularly promising to provide more sensitive imaging markers in schizophrenia (10).
We observed alterations of brain networks’ duration and couplings in 22q11DS and associations between
these patterns of alterations with positive psychotic symptoms and anxiety. We found shorter activation of
fronto-parietal network (FPN), salience network (SN) and default-mode network (DMN) and longer activation of inferior temporal and limbic networks, as well as globally increased segregation between networks.
Functional signatures of prodromal psychotic symptoms uncovered a pattern of relevant activation duration
and coupling of dorsal anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (dACC/dlPFC). Functional
signatures of anxiety revealed an implication of amygdala and hippocampus (AMY/HIP) activation duration and coupling, suggesting an adversarial effect of coupling with different sub-divisions of the ACC and
medial PFC (mPFC), either reinforcing or protecting from anxiety.
Alterations in 22q11DS: implication of cognitive and emotional brain networks
Comparing individuals with 22q11DS to healthy controls (HCs) revealed a varied pattern of longer and
shorter network activations, suggesting that they ‘over-engage’ certain brain states, while ‘under-engaging’
in others. In particular, patients with 22q11DS presented shorter activation of FPN, DMN and cinguloprefrontal SN (i.e., dACC/dlPFC). According to the triple-network hypothesis, these three core brain networks play a central role for higher cognitive functions and conversely their dysfunctional interaction could
account for several psychiatric symptoms (57). Specifically, the hypothesis stipulates that the dynamic shift
between an internally-oriented default state and the externally-directed goal-directed fronto-parietal state
is mediated by the activation of a third network responsible for attributing salience. Of note, while these
dynamic interactions are critical for higher cognitive functioning, they even occur at rest (28). Still, static
connectivity approaches are unable to fully capture the proposed dynamic nature of such interactions. Here
we observe reduced activation of all three networks in 22q11DS, which could suggest a less efficient engagement in these basic brain dynamics that are crucial to engage and disengage in goal-directed behavior. One
could speculate that the disruption of these core mechanisms may underlie broad impairments in higher

cognitive function described both in 22q11DS and psychosis (56, 35). In turn, there was longer activation in
networks comprising limbic regions including amygdala, medial temporal and orbitofrontal cortices. While
the dichotomy between cognitive and emotional brain is arguably artificial, longer activation in regions highly
involved in emotional processing such as amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex could reflect higher emotional
load during scanning in patients with 22q11DS (47, 68). The pattern of activation showed a significant, but
different, development with age in both subgroups. Whilst in HCs higher age was associated with increased
duration in FPN and cingulo-prefrontal SN and reduced duration of limbic networks, the opposite pattern
was observed in 22q11DS. These results suggest that the atypical activation pattern observed in 22q11DS
emerges with age, in accordance with the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia (35, 73).
Besides duration of activation, the iCAPs approach allowed us to probe the pattern of coupling between
different networks. The pattern of altered couplings in 22q11DS was characterized by predominantly longer
anti-couplings, accounting for more than half (13/25) of the alterations. Longer anti-coupling is suggestive
of increased segregation between brain networks and is in agreement with evidence of increased segregation
and decreased integration of structural and functional brain networks in both 22q11DS and non-syndromic
psychosis (64, 76, 77, 79, 91, 93). Network segregation is a central feature of brain function that is important
for cognition and attention (97) and its alterations in 22q11DS may be reflective of cognitive disabilities on
a more global level than the above mentioned alterations in triple network activation that concentrates on
three core networks.
Functional signature of psychosis prodrome: aberrant salience network duration and coupling
The presence of prodromal psychotic symptoms was associated with longer activation of inferior temporal
and fusiform (iTEMP/FUS), dACC/dlPFC and FPN. Increased activation of inferior temporal and fusiform
gyrus has been previously reported in schizophrenia in terms of relative cerebral blood flow (44, 51) and
BOLD variability (49). Also in 22q11DS, we observed higher BOLD variability in inferior temporal and
fusiform regions in a partially overlapping sample (102), suggesting that increased BOLD variability might
reflect longer network activation. Further, prodromal psychotic symptoms were associated with longer
activation of the dACC/dlPFC network. The dACC is considered a key node of the SN involved in attributing
subjective salience to internally and externally generated events (57, 86). Aberrant salience attribution
has been proposed to possibly account for several positive psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations
and delusions (37). Also electroencephalogram (EEG) studies in psychosis and 22q11DS have consistently
reported longer representation of the EEG topography that corresponds to SN (7, 74, 88, 89), which, together

with our findings, supports that aberrant salience processing may be a key mechanism in the emergence of
psychotic symptoms in 22q11DS.
However, whilst duration of both dACC/dlPFC and FPN was positively correlated with psychotic symptoms, it was reduced overall in 22q11DS compared to HCs. Converging evidence from both structural and
functional MRI points towards altered connectivity of the ACC in individuals with 22q11DS and psychotic
symptoms (20, 76, 80, 101), reviewed in (65). Hence we suspected that the quality of the activations; i.e.,
the coupling with other networks, might be relevant for higher psychotic symptoms. Indeed, the analysis
of dACC/dlPFC couplings revealed a significant relationship between higher psychotic symptoms and anticoupling with both FPN and iTEMP/FUS. Taken together, these results suggest that whilst activations of
dACC/dlPFC and FPN occur less frequently in 22q11DS in general, they are more frequently anti-coupled
with one another and with iTEMP/FUS in patients with higher psychotic symptoms. The triple-network
model proposes that activation of the SN is instrumental in re-orienting attention by mediating the shifts
between DMN and FPN (57). Our findings of longer anti-coupling between SN and FPN suggest that this
functional role of the cingulo-prefrontal SN is disrupted in individuals with higher psychotic symptoms,
possibly reflecting mechanisms that underlie atypical salience processing (37).
Altogether, the richness of our iCAPs approach permitted to characterize a pattern reflecting SN activations that contribute to the pathophysiology of psychotic symptoms, both in terms of duration and quality.
Our findings support the key role of network dynamics in the ACC in increased psychosis vulnerability
(65) and point towards disrupted triple network function centered on the SN, which might reflect aberrant
salience processing in patients with psychotic symptoms (57, 37).
Functional signature of anxiety: aberrant amygdala & hippocampus duration and coupling
For both HCs and patients with 22q11DS anxiety was associated with a pattern of longer activation of
AMY/HIP, iTEMP/FUS and primary visual (PrimVIS2) and shorter activation of anterior DMN (aDMN).
Evidence in animal models and humans has revealed a central role of the amygdala in fear exposure, anticipation and reaction (47, 90, 16, 52). Anxiety in humans is associated with hyper-reactivity of the amygdala
to fearful stimuli (22, 25). Also in absence of stimulation, increased metabolic activity in amygdala, hippocampus and inferior temporal cortex was found in rhesus monkeys with anxious temperament (26, 27) and
cerebral blood flow in amygdala and fusiform cortex has been associated with trait anxiety in humans (36).
The iCAPs approach allowed us to quantify moments of network activation and confirmed that hyperactivity AMY/HIP and iTEMP/FUS at rest could indeed represent trait markers of anxiety in both HCs and

22q11DS. Hyperactivity of both AMY/HIP and iTEMP/FUS observed in 22q11DS could therefore account
for increased prevalence of anxiety disorders in this population.
Importantly, the amygdala does not operate in isolation, but is part of a complex circuit involved in
regulating emotional responses (21). Indeed, in accord with the role in salience processing mentioned
above, the dorsal portion of the ACC and PFC promote amygdala activity and are critical in the appraisal
and expression of fear behavior (21). Oppositely, the subgenual-ACC and ventral mPFC largely dampen
amygdala activity and are essential for fear extinction (21). This functional sub-division of the frontal
lobe is also supported by extensive literature on fear circuitry in rodents, where the dorsal pre-limbic and
the ventral infra-limbic cortices are found to have opposing roles on amygdala activation, fear expression,
respectively fear extinction (90, 21, 58, 72, 94, 13, 14, 9). Given these findings, we speculated that the
modulation of AMY/HIP activity particularly by the dACC/dlPFC and aDMN network may play a crucial
role in the pathophysiology of anxiety. Indeed, we showed a significant positive association between anxiety
and coupling duration between AMY/HIP and dACC/dlPFC, along with language network (LAN), FPN
and iTEMP/FUS. Coupling duration between AMY/HIP and aDMN had an opposite, protective role on
anxiety in accordance with the modulating role of mPFC-AMY projections on fear expression. Of note,
the effects of amygdala coupling on anxiety appeared specific to individuals with 22q11DS, which could
suggest that effects of amygdala modulation are nonlinear and relate only to more severe anxiety observed
in 22q11DS.
In conclusion, we observed a dynamic functional pattern characterized both by longer AMY/HIP activations and atypical prefrontal AMY/HIP modulation, which might constitute a trait maker of anxiety and
contribute vulnerability to psychosis in 22q11DS.
Methodological aspects
The iCAPs framework
The present study is one of the first to apply the iCAPs framework in a clinical population and, due
to the flexibility of the framework, we were able to discover distinct patterns of functional activation and
interaction characteristic for prodromal psychotic symptoms and anxiety. The framework is unique in its
ability to detect spatially and temporally overlapping networks (41, 103), and the robustness and richness
of the presented results underlines its potential. Of note, extracted spatial patterns were highly similar
to previously observed iCAPs retrieved from healthy subjects (41, 103), which reassures the performance
of the iCAPs approach in a clinical population. Furthermore, the sub-division of classical resting-state
networks such as the DMN and SN into multiple subnetworks confirms previously observed findings (41)

and suggests that different subnetworks have distinct dynamic properties, which are difficult to detect by
static approaches.
While iCAPs themselves were retrieved from a purely dynamic measure (i.e., the innovations), the
measure of coupling duration between networks is closely linked to static functional connectivity (sFC). A
direct comparison between the two showed that, as expected, alterations in couplings are related to aberrant
sFC (see Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure S6). However, while the results were similar,
they were not identical, which is most likely due to the deconvolution, denoising and reconstruction of blocklike time courses conducted before computing coupling duration. No such direct comparison was possible
for activation duration, as it is a measure specific to each network which cannot be explained in terms of
static connectivity.
BOLD signal analysis and motion
As in any fMRI study, we cannot exclude that the measured effects may have been influenced by nonneural confounds, such as heartbeat, respiration and motion (70). For the current study, we addressed this
issue by taking typical measures during preprocessing, such as regression of WM and CSF signals, as well as
motion censoring. Further, it is of note that the regularized deconvolution from the hemodynamic response
function (HRF) further minimizes such effects, as any non-neural signals, which do not follow the HRF,
are filtered out by the approach. Finally, we included group-centered average framewise displacement as
nuisance regressor in all analyses to further avoid any confounding effects caused by motion in particular.
To explicitly investigate whether observed group differences may have been caused by motion artifacts,
we compared iCAPs activation duration in HCs with high motion versus low motion (see Supplementary
Figure S5 and Supplementary Table S7). There were no significant differences in activation duration between
these two groups, which suggests that motion was indeed not a major confound in our analysis. In patients
with 22q11DS scanner motion is strongly correlated with the severity of symptoms, which makes it impossible
to disentangle the two effects. Therefore, this remains a limitation of our study, despite the multiple measures
we took to account for non-neural confounds.
Conclusion
In summary, we here presented functional signatures of anxiety and positive psychotic symptoms in
22q11DS in terms of brain network activation and coupling. Our results confirm the implication of SN
activity and connectivity in the emergence of psychotic symptoms. We further uncovered differential roles
of dorsal and ventral ACC and mPFC coupling with AMY that are relevant for anxiety. Together, these

findings shed light into the pathophysiology of two clinical risk factors that might represent relevant imaging
markers for psychosis vulnerability.

Methods and Materials
Participants
The study included 221 subjects (111 patients with 22q11DS, 110 healthy controls (HCs), both aged 8–30
years). We excluded 33 patients and 25 HCs to ensure good data quality (see Supplementary Methods).
The final sample included 78 patients with 22q11DS (37 males) and 85 HCs (36 males, see Table 1). HCs
were recruited among patients’ siblings and through the Geneva state school system and had no present or
past history of neurological or psychiatric disorders.
Prodromal positive psychotic symptoms in patients with 22q11DS were assessed using the Structured
Interview of Prodromal Symptoms (SIPS; 61). The SIPS was not conducted in HCs. Anxiety was assessed
both in HCs and patients with 22q11DS by combining the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) AnxiousDepressed scale (1) in children, and the Adult Behavioral Checklist (ABCL) Anxious scale in adults above
18 years old (2).
Participants and their parents (for minors) gave their written informed consent and the research protocols
were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Geneva University School of Medicine.
Image acquisition
All MRI brain scans were acquired at the Centre d’Imagerie BioMédicale (CIBM) in Geneva on a Siemens
Trio (12-channel coil; 54 HCs, 42 patients) and a Siemens Prisma (20-channel coil; 31 HCs, 36 patients)
3 Tesla scanner. Structural images were obtained with a T1-weighted sequence of 0.86×0.86×1.1 mm3
volumetric resolution (192 coronal slices, TR = 2500 ms, TE = 3 ms, acquisition matrix = 224 × 256, field
of view = 22 cm2 , flip angle = 8◦ ). Eyes-open rs-fMRI data were recorded with a T2*-weighted sequence of
8 minutes (voxel size = 1.84×1.84×3.2 mm, 38 axial slices, TR = 2400 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 85◦ ).
Subjects were instructed to fixate a cross on the screen, let their mind wander and not to fall asleep.
Preprocessing
Before applying the iCAPs pipeline, MRI scans were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping
(SPM12, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) and functions of the Data Processing Assistant for RestingState fMRI (DPARSF; 98) and Individual Brain Atlases using Statistical Parametric Mapping (IBASPM;

3) toolboxes. After realignment of functional scans, we applied spatial smoothing with an isotropic Gaussian
kernel of 6 mm full width half maximum and coregistered structural scans to the functional mean. Structural
images were segmented with the SPM12 Segmentation algorithm (5) and a study-specific template was
generated using Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponential Lie algebra (DARTEL; 4). Then,
the first five functional scans were excluded and average white-matter and CSF signals were regressed out
from the BOLD timeseries. We applied motion scrubbing (69) for the extended correction of motion artifacts,
marking frames with a framewise displacement of more than 0.5 mm. As the filters implemented in the
iCAPs framework require a constant sampling rate, marked frames were replaced by the spline interpolation
of previous and following frames. Finally, motion frames were excluded before computation of temporal
characteristics (described below).
Total Activation and iCAPs
We used openly available Matlab code (https://c4science.ch/source/iCAPs/) to apply innovation-driven
co-activation patterns (iCAPs; 41, 42, 103). We first employed Total Activation (TA; 39, 40, 23), which
applies hemodynamically-informed deconvolution to the fMRI timeseries through spatio-temporal regularization. Significant activation changepoints (i.e., transients), derived from deconvolved timeseries, were
concatenated across all subjects and fed into temporal K-means clustering to obtain simultaneously transitioning brain patterns, the iCAPs. The optimum number of clusters was determined by consensus clustering
(62). Finally, time courses were obtained for all iCAPs using spatio-temporal transient-informed regression
(103). A detailed description of all steps can be found in the Supplementary Methods.
Extraction of temporal properties
For computation of temporal properties, iCAPs time courses were z-scored within each subject and
thresholded at a z-score > |1| to determine ‘active’ timepoints (41). For each iCAP, we then computed the
total duration of overall activation as percentage of the total non-motion scanning time.
Further, coupling and anti-coupling duration of two iCAPs were calculated as timepoints of same-signed
or oppositely-signed co-activation measured as percentage of the total non-motion scanning time or as
Jaccard score; i.e., percent joint activation time of the two respective iCAPs.
Statistical analysis
Group comparisons of duration and coupling time
Duration and coupling measures between groups were compared using two-sample t-tests. P-values were
corrected for multiple comparisons with the false discovery rate (FDR).

Partial Least Squares Correlation for multivariate relationship between iCAPs measures and behavioral variables
To evaluate multivariate patterns of correlation between behavioral variables and iCAPs activation measures, we used behavior partial least squares correlation (PLSC; 46). Briefly, we first computed a correlation
matrix between behavioral variables (age, SIPS items, or CBCL/ABCL anxiety scores) and brain variables
(iCAPs activation, positive coupling or anti-coupling duration). Group-specific correlation matrices of HCs
and patients with 22q11DS were concatenated and singular value decomposition of this matrix then lead to
several correlation components. Each correlation component is composed of a set of “behavior weights” and
“iCAPs duration/coupling weights”. These weights indicate how strongly each variable contributes to the
multivariate brain-behavior correlation in the associated correlation component. The weights lie between
–1 and 1 and can be interpreted similarly to correlation values. Significance of correlation components was
determined by permutation testing (1000 permutations) and stability of brain and behavior weights was
obtained using bootstrapping (500 bootstrap samples). See Supplementary Methods for a detailed outline
of PLSC.
We conducted multiple PLSC to investigate how psychotic symptoms and anxiety are related to the
iCAPs’ activation and coupling measures. First, we conducted two PLSC analysis with the durations of
altered iCAPs as brain measures and psychotic symptoms, respectively anxiety as behavioral measures.
Then, we probed into behavioral effects of positive couplings and anti-couplings of one selected iCAP for
each of the two behavioral measures, resulting in four more PLSC analyses. Due to the difference in design
of each single PLSC in terms of type of measure and number of items, we did not correct for multiple
comparisons.
Nuisance variable regression
Age, gender and motion were included as nuisance regressors in group comparisons and PLSC analyses.
Nuisance regressors were standardized within each group to avoid linear dependence with the effects of
interest.
