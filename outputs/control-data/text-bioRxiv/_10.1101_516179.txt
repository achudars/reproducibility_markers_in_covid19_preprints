16Abstract
17Cytoplasmic dynein is a two-headed molecular motor that moves to the minus end of
18microtubule (MT) using ATP hydrolysis free energy. By employing its two heads (motor
19domains), cytoplasmic dynein shows various bipedal stepping motions; the inchworm and hand20over-hand motions, as well as non-alternate steps of one head. However, the molecular basis to
21achieve such diverse stepping manners remains obscure. Here, we propose a kinetic model for
22bipedal motions of cytoplasmic dynein and performed Gillespie Monte Carlo simulations that
23reproduces most experimental data obtained to date. The model represents status of each motor
24domain as five states according to conformations, nucleotide- and MT-binding conditions of the
25domain. Also, the relative positions of the two domains were approximated by three discrete
26states. Accompanied by ATP hydrolysis cycles, the model dynein stochastically and
27processively moved forward in multiple steps via diverse pathways, including inchworm and
28hand-over-hand motions, same as experimental data. The model reproduced key experimental
29motility-related parameters including velocity and run-length as functions of ATP concentration
30and external force. Our model reveals that, in a typical inchworm motion, the leading domain
31moves via the ATP-dependent power-stroke of the linker coupled with a small change in the
32stalk angle, whereas the lagging domain moves via diffusion dragged by the leading domain.
33Moreover, the hand-over-hand motion in the model dynein clearly differs from that of kinesin
34by the usage of the power-stroke.

Summary

36Cytoplasmic dynein is a two-headed molecular motor, which moves linearly and transports
37intra-cellar organelles along microtubules driven by ATP hydrolysis free energy. In contrast to
38other better-known molecular motors, such as kinesin, dynein is known to take various stepping
39motions including motions akin to human walking and inchworm-like motions. However,
40molecular mechanisms underpinning the diverse stepping motions are unclear. Here, based on
41recent high-resolution structure information and single-molecule motility assay data, we
42designed a kinetic model that explicitly include two heads, each of which makes ATP
43hydrolysis cycles and moves along the microtubules. Using the model, we performed Monte
44Carlo simulations. The simulation reproduced most of currently available experimental results.
45More importantly, the simulation suggested molecular mechanisms of various stepping motions.
46While stepping motions apparently resemble to those proposed before, once looking into details,
47we found the resulting mechanisms distinct from previously proposed ones in the usage of ATP
48and protein conformation changes coupled with stepping motions.

50Introduction
51Cytoplasmic dynein (hereafter, denoted as dynein for simplicity) is a molecular motor that show
52bipedal motions on the microtubules (MT) to its minus end, driven by ATP hydrolysis free
53energy[1–3]. This motility enables dynein to play essential roles in various cellular functions
54including intracellular transport, positioning of organelles and cell division. As such, dynein is
55often compared with another MT-based molecular motor, kinesin, most of which walks to the
56plus end of MT[4]. Single-molecular measurements clarified that the kinesin-1 walks rather
57regularly via the so-called hand-over-hand manner; two motor domains alternately move from
58the lagging position to the leading position, akin to human walking. This motion of kinesin
59leads to precise 8 nm steps per one ATP hydrolysis reaction[5]. The hand-over-hand mechanism
60is also in harmony with the experiment that a mutant kinesin that impairs one motor domain
61severely slows down kinesin motility [6,7]. In contrast, dynein moves more stochastically with
62various step size, which ranges 4-32 nm with its representative size of 8 nm [8–11]. In addition
63to the hand-over-hand motions, dynein can take the so-called inchworm-like motions; walking
64via alternating steps with one motor domain being always ahead of the other domain, as well as
65non-alternating steps[10–13].
66

Previous structural studies delineate the ATP-dependent conformational changes in each

67dynein motor domain. The dynein motor domain consists of the ATPase associated with diverse
68cellular activities (AAA+) ring[14,15], the microtubule binding domain (MTBD), the stalk, the
69linker, and the tail domain (see cartoons in Fig 1A). The AAA+ ring (a large donut shape in Fig
701A) made of six subdomains, AAA1-AAA6, possesses the ATPase activity and energizes the
71dynein movement[16]. The MTBD (small circles near the MT in Fig 1A) is a small domain
72responsible for the binding to MT. The stalk is a long coiled-coil that connects the AAA+ ring
73and the MTBD[16,17]. The linker (an arrowhead-like object drawn on the AAA+ ring) is
74associated with the AAA+ ring and connects to the tail domain where two motor domains
75dimerize (the tail domain not drawn in Fig 1A)[18,19]. Biochemical and structural experiments
76have revealed that ATP hydrolysis reactions in AAA1 play the primary role in the movement,
77affecting conformations of the entire motor domain[15,20]. In particular, depending on the
78nucleotide state in AAA1, both the linker and the MTBD make marked structural changes
79which are of central importance in the motility[17]. When AAA1 is in the ATP-bound state, the
80linker is largely bent on the AAA+ ring and the tip of the linker is located near AAA2/AAA3
81subdomains (the bottom-left cartoon in Fig 1B), whereas, in the ADP bound and apo state of
82AAA1, the linker tends to be more extended on the AAA+ ring reaching to the AAA4/AAA5
83subdomains (the top-right cartoon in Fig 1B)[21–24]. The linker is expected to swing

84simultaneously or immediately after Pi release and swings back upon ATP binding, which are
85termed the power-stroke and recovery-stroke, respectively. The power-stroke of the linker is
86considered to be responsible for dynein force generation [17,25,26]. The MTBD tends to take a
87low affinity state to MT in the ATP bound state, while it takes a high affinity conformation to
88MT in the ADP-bound and apo states [20]. This ATP-dependent change in the affinity of
89MTBD must be critical, because dynein needs to bind tightly with MT when it exerts force
90against MT but needs to dissociate from MT during recovery-stroke to avoid backward
91movement[27,28]. In addition to these specific parts of the motor domain, allosteric
92conformational changes in the entire motor domain may play an important role for the dynein
93movement[29,30].

However, these ATP-dependent conformational changes in each motor domain alone do not

108explain how diverse walking manners are realized. In order to clarify the mechanism of various
109walking manners, we need to characterize coordination of the two motor domain movements
110coupled with ATPase cycle. Observing the coordinated motion directly by single-molecule
111experiments is, however, currently difficult due to the time- and the spatial-resolution.
112

Therefore, several theoretical models have been proposed to understand the walking

113mechanisms of dynein. Most theoretical models proposed before the X-ray structure reports are
114unavoidably simple and consider only one motor domain [31,32]. A more elaborate kinetic
115model that explicitly deals with coordination of the two motor domains clarified a class of
116necessary coordination and the force-dependent motility change well [33]. The model is,
117however, limited to the hand-over-hand coordination and is not compatible with recent
118experimental data. More recently, a mechano-chemical model that connects the two ATP-

119dependent motor domains via elastic bonds elucidated correlation between the motion and the
120tension [34]. Yet, in the model, chemical cycles in the two domains are treated as independent.
121However, in order to clarify the mechanism of versatile walking mechanisms, it is crucial to
122model how ATP hydrolysis reactions and conformational change proceed, correlated with the
123relative configuration of the two motor domains.
124

In this study, we propose a new kinetic model of dynein that explicitly contains chemical

125and conformational states of each motor domain, directly coupled with the relative positions of
126the two domains along MT. The kinetic model can explain molecular basis of versatile walking
127manners. We represent chemical and conformational states of each dynein motor domain as 5
128discrete states. For the relative positions of the two domains, for simplicity, we assume it taking
1293 discrete states: either one is 8 nm ahead of, at the same position as, or 8 nm behind the other
130motor domain along MT. Together our kinetic model consists of

5 ×5 ×3=75 states and

131considers transitions among these states, which is solved by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with
132the Gillespie algorithm[35]. We reproduced experimentally observed behaviors with various
133dynein walking manner and uncovered detailed and comprehensive pathways.

state model for a dynein motor domain.

137Our model assumes that each dynein motor domain takes one of five possible states depending
138on the combination of the nucleotide bound in AAA1, the binding to MT, conformation of the
139linker, and that of MTBD (Fig 1B). The five states are the followings:
140(1) The DM state: ADP is bound in AAA1. The linker is in the post-power-stroke (extended)
141

state. The high-affinity MTBD binds to MT.

142(2) The T state: ATP is bound in AAA1. The linker is in the post-power-stroke state. The low143

affinity MTBD is unbound from MT.

144(3) The T* state: ATP is bound in AAA1. The linker is in the pre-power-stroke (bent) state. The
145

low-affinity MTBD is unbound from MT. The stalk leans towards the MT long axis.

146(4) The D*M state: ADP is bound in AAA1. The linker is in the pre-power-stroke state. The
147

high-affinity MTBD binds to MT. The stalk leans towards the MT long axis.

148(5) The D state: ADP is bound in AAA1. The linker is in the post-power-stroke state. The high149

affinity MTBD is, however, unbound from MT.

150Of the five states, the states (1) and (3) correspond to X-ray crystal structures solved to date
151(PDB ID: 3VKH and 4RH7, respectively)[22,36] (note that those are for different families) and
152thus are assumed to be relatively stable, whereas the other three states are considered as

153transient states with higher free energies. We note that, when the linker takes the pre-power154stroke state (the D*M and T* states), we assume that the stalk leans to the MT long axis with a
155smaller angle between the stalk and the MT compared with the other states. This is based on
156experimental data that suggests the motor domain to stand up with the MTBD position fixed
157upon power stroke motion[37]. This suggestion was further supported by some electron158microscopic observations for cytoplasmic dynein [38,39] as well as for axonemal dynein [17].
159

Next, we setup transitions among the five states of motor domain.

160(1) DM→T: ADP release is followed by ATP binding and a dissociation of the motor domain
161

from MT

162(2) T→T*: The recovery-stroke of the linker
163(3) T*→D*M: ATP hydrolysis is followed by the Pi release and the binding of the motor
164

domain to MT

165(4) D*M→DM: The power-stroke of the linker
166The above four transitions form the main (and thus productive) ATP hydrolysis cycle.
167Additionally, we include the following off-pathways.
168(5) D*M→D & DM→D: The dissociation of the motor domain from MT
169(6) D→T: ADP release is followed by ATP binding, without the binding to MT
170(7) T*→D: ATP hydrolysis is followed by Pi release, without the binding to MT.
171Our model assumes that the ATP hydrolysis cycle of one ATP molecule corresponds to one
172power-stroke and recovery stroke, without considering ATP hydrolysis in other AAAs than
173AAA1 subdomain.
174

Since the dynein motor domain never synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi in any condition, we

175do not consider the reverse transitions of (3) or (7), D*M→T* or D→T*. For all the other
176transitions, we take into considerations of the reverse transitions. We note that all the cyclic
177transition paths that do not include the ATP hydrolysis, i.e. T*→D*M and T*→D, should give
178no net free energy changes. This leads us to the following equalities to be satisfied.

184We next define the position of the dynein motor domain. Since cargos in vivo and beads in
185single-molecule experiments are connected to the tip of the linker, we define the position of

186motor domain by the position of the tip of the linker. In addition, we approximate that the tip of
187the linker resides in discrete positions spaced with 8 nm (Fig 1C).
188

Next, we discuss the movement of the motor domain. We assume that the position of the

189linker tip changes via the power-stoke/recovery-stroke, and the diffusive motion. First, in the
190power-stroke transition D*M→DM (see Fig 1B), the tip of the linker position moves 8 nm to
191the forward direction (the minus end of MT), whereas in the reverse reaction of the power192stroke (note that this is not the recovery stroke), the tip moves 8 nm to the backward direction
193(the plus end of MT) although the reverse reaction rarely happens.
194

Both the yeast and human dynein molecules can move forward against 5~10 pN backward

195loading [9,40]. If the load force disturbs the linker motion completely, the dynein molecules
196would not step forward. Therefore, as a common feature of dynein, the power-stroke motion of
197the linker should be able to undergo against more than 5~10 pN of the load. This led us to
198model the following energy difference between pre- and post- power stroke states;
199

(

k DM ← D M
10 pN × 8 nm
=exp
k D M ← DM
kB T
¿

¿

)

200where T is the temperature, the Boltzmann constant k B takes k B=0.0138

pN ∙nm/ K . We note

201that the tip of the linker does not move during the recovery-stroke from the T to T* states
202because the MTBD is unbound from MT.
203

Next, we consider the diffusive motion. In our five states model, only in the D, T and T*

204states among five states of our model, the motor domain can move diffusively along MT. We
205assume that the motor domain takes an 8-nm step to forward or backward direction during the
206diffusive movement. We define the rates for the forward and backward diffusive transitions as
207 λ for and

λ back, respectively. The values of λ for and λ back are set as the same for all the three

208states; the D state, the T state, and the T* state. In addition, by symmetry,

λ for and λ back must be

209the same values when the external force is not applied.
210
211The dimeric

dynein motor domains

212We assume that dynein moves as a homo-dimer of the motor domain throughout this study. To
213distinguish two identical motor domains, throughout the paper, we call the first one as "red
214domain" and the second domain as "blue domain", merely for convenience, corresponding to the
215colors used in figures (Fig 1D for example). For the minimal complexity of the model, we set
216that the difference in the positions of the two motor domains along MT being either +8 nm, 0
217nm, or -8 nm (Fig 1D for the case of +8 nm). Thus, the relative positions of the two dynein
218motors can be regarded as the three-state model. When the red motor domain is ahead of, at the

219same position as, and behind the blue motor domain, we write their configurations as +, 0, and -,
220respectively (The minus end of MT is regarded as the forward direction). Assumed here is that
221the two motor domains use different protofilaments so that they can have 0 nm distance along
222axial direction of MT. We do not include the side-steps from one to another proto-filaments. We
223also note that the generalization of this restraint of the inter-motor-domain distance to the
224multiples of 8 nm is straightforward.
225 Combining 5 states for each motor domain and 3 states for the relative positions between the
226two motor domains, the current model for the dimeric dynein has

5 ×5 ×3=75 states in total.

227To indicate each of 75 states clearly, we introduce a combinatorial notation, which we explain
228with an example, 2TDM+. In this notation, the first integer (2 in the example) represents the
229numbering of the state from 1 to 75 (S1 Table). The following characters represent states of the
230first (red one in Fig 1D) and the second (blue one in Fig 1D) motor domains; in this example the
231red motor domain is in the T state, while the blue one is in the DM state. The last symbol, either
232+, 0, or -, represents the relative position of the two motor domains along MT.
233
234Effect

of external forces

235Our model incorporates the effect of external force. We suppose the external force is applied to
236the tip of the linker through the attached bead or cargo in the direction parallel to MT. In this
237work, we limit ourselves to the case where the external force is applied to the plus end
238(backward direction to the functional movements) of MT. When one motor domains is ahead of
239another domain, i.e. the state with + or -, it is natural to assume that the external force is applied
240only to the motor domain that locates in the opposite side to the direction of the external force.
241Thus, the external force

F is applied to the leading motor domain located closer to the minus

242end. When the two motor domains take the same position along the MT, we assume each motor
243domain is subjected to a half of the external force
244

F /2.

Since the power-stroke changes the bead position, transition rates for the power-stroke and its

245reverse process must be affected by the external force. We can easily incorporate this effect into
246the energy difference between pre- and post- power-stroke states as,

(

k DM ← D M
(10−F) pN × 8 nm

k D M ← DM

248Of note, the external force

)

(4 )

F takes the positive value when dynein is pulled to the plus end

249direction of MT. Based on this equation, we rescaled the rate of the reverse of the power-stroke
250process, making it more probable to occur as the force is applied, whereas the rate of the power251stroke is unchanged.

252

Similarly, the diffusive motions are affected by the external force. It is natural to assume the

253ratios between
254

λ for and λ back depends on the external force as

(

λ for
−F pN × 8 nm
=exp
λback
kB T

) exp ⁡(−1.9 F pN)

255We have multiple choices of
256pendence in

(5)

λ for and λ back that satisfy this equation. Here, we put the force de-

λ back making the backward diffusion more probable to occur as the force is ap-

257plied, while the rate of the forward step is unchanged. Besides, previous experiments uncovered
258that the dissociation rates of the motor domain from the MT increases with the external force
259[41,42]. Since this could be an essential feature of the dynein motor domain, we include this ef260fect into our model. Specifically, all the transitions from MT-bound states to unbound states,
261such as D*M→D and DM→D, that occur in the leading motor domain are accelerated by a
262force-dependent factor. Note that this corresponds to the increase in the free energy of the lead263ing domain MT-bound state by the logarithm of the force-dependent factor. We introduce a
264multiplying factor

f ext ( F) into the dissociation rates of the motor domain under the force F . An

265example is illustrated in Fig 1E. We set

f ext (F)=exp (B ∙ F) because the associated energy

266changes should be proportional to the external force. Here, B is a fitting parameter that we esti267mate below. When the motor domain that is subjected to a half of the external force dissociates
268from MT, the factor becomes

f ext ( F /2 )= √ f ext ( F) (see an example in Fig 1E from the third to

269the fourth states).
270
271Internal force between two motor domains
272Since the two motor domains are connected, each motor domain should receive internal force
273from the other one when the both motor domains are bound on MT. We treat the internal force
274being independent of the external force. Previous experimental study shows the asymmetric
275dissociation rates of MTBD from MT for the case of internal force[41,42]. Therefore, the
276lagging motor domain should dissociate with larger rates than that of the leading (minus-end
277side) motor domain due to the opposite directions of internal force for the leading and lagging
278motor domains when both motor domains are bound to MT with 8-nm gap,. We incorporate this
279effect by introducing a multiplying factor f ∫ ¿¿ into the dissociation rate of the lagging motor
280domain when the leading domain is also bound on the MT (Fig 1F).
281

To satisfy the condition that the free energy change along any cyclic path must be zero, we

282put the same factor f ∫ ¿¿ , either in the numerator or in the denominator, of many surrounding

283transition rates, as in S1 Fig. We begin with the acceleration of the transitions by f ∫ ¿¿ ;
2844D*MDM+ → 24D*MD+ and 1DMDM+ → 21DMD+ (see Fig 1F), in which the lagging
285motor domains are peeled out due to the inter-motor domain force. These changes are
286accommodated by increasing the free energies of 4D*MDM+ and 1DMDM+ by

ln ⁡¿ , which

287can be viewed as the internal tension. These free energy changes in the two states result in
288including the same multiplying factor, either in the numerator or in the denominator of all the
289rate constants connected with these two states (Fig 1F for an example and S1 Fig for the
290complete picture). For example, in S1 Fig, 4D*MDM+ can transit to 5DDM+ and 9D*MT+ so
291that we introduce f ∫ ¿¿ into the incoming rates from these two states.
292
293Setting

up the rate constants

294Now, we discuss the values of rate constants. As of now, due to the lack of experimental mea295surements, we cannot decide many parameters without uncertainty. Yet, we would like to
296choose a set of parameters that satisfy the physics law, equations (1)-(4), and that are consistent
297with all the available data as much as possible.

First, from single-molecule experiments for the monomeric dynein, we can set

[43].

Second, the transition DM→T contains the ADP release (k ADP−¿ :10 s ¿ ), ATP binding (

301k ATP +¿: 2 μM ∙s−1¿ ), and the dissociation from MT (k off : 500 s ), as a roughly sequential process
302[43]. So we can express k T ← DM as
303k T ← DM =

20 ∙ [ ATP ]
2∙ [ ATP ] +10

304In the derivation process, we assumed that the dissociation from MT is much faster than the
305other processes. Thus, k T ← D becomes the same as
306

k T ← DM .

Third, since direct experimental data are not available at the moment for other values,

307we infer physically feasible values guided by the detailed balance conditions and other re308straints. We assume the power-stroke motion is fast enough and set it as
−1

309k DM ← D¿ M =1000 s . Of note, as far as this is large enough, the result does not depend on
310this precise value at all. Using the physical constraint, eq.(4), we also can obtain

312Next, we suppose that the high affinity MTBD does not dissociate from MT without the applied
313external or internal force. We thus choose k D ← DM as a sufficiently small value; specifically, it
314must be much smaller than k T ← DM

10 s−1 at its saturated value. Since both k D ← DM and

315k D ← D ¿ M represent dissociation of the high affinity MTBD from MT, we set

k D ← DM =k D ← D M .
¿

316The D state must be inherently unstable. Thus, the lifetime of the D state is short and it changes
317quickly to the DM state. It is natural to assume

k DM ← D >k T ← DM 10 s−1 . From the detailed

Next, we determine the external force dependent factors. The detachment force of dynein,

328i.e., a critical force beyond which dynein detaches from MT promptly, to the plus end of MT
329with the high affinity MTBD is estimated to be approximately 2 pN (Shima et al, manuscript in
330preparation). This suggests that, with the external force of 2 pN, the DM state should change to
331the D state, rather than the other states, i.e., the T state. Thus, we require
332k T ← DM ≪

f ext (F)∙ k D ← DM (¿ k D ← D M ). We note that k T ← DM =10 s−1 at the saturated ATP con¿

333centration. Since we set the dissociation rates with no external force to be
334k D ← D ¿ M =k D ← DM =
335end, we obtain

1 −1
s , previously, we decided to choose f ext (2 pN )=10000 . To this
100

f ext ( F )=100(F pN) exp ⁡( 4.61 F pN ). Note that the estimate of the detachment

336force contains some uncertainty; if the detachment force were equal to 3 pN, we would have
337 f ext ( F )
338

exp ⁡(3.07 F pN )

While there is no experimental estimate for the value of f ∫ ¿¿ , merely for the consistency with

339the effect of the external force in the previous section, we set f ∫ ¿=10000 ¿ ; we suppose the dissoci340ate rate of the relevant motor domain from MT may be equal. We also tested how this value
341would alter the results, finding that most of the qualitative results are not changed, except the
342probabilities to choose individual paths (see Discussions).

345As the basic dynamic equations for the kinetic model of

5 ×5 ×3=75 states, we take the master

346equation;

348the transition matrix T i← j represents corresponding transition rates for the non-diagonal
349elements and cumulative outgoing rates for the diagonal elements, respectively. Of the

7 5 ×75

350matrix elements, we have already described all the non-zero elements, while the other elements
351are zero. In this work, we solved this master equation via Gillespie Monte Carlo (MC)
352simulations, a random number-based sampling of the solution. When the system resides in j-th
353state at a time t, the Gillespie algorithm first chooses the state to go; among those connected
354from the current state j, a state i is chosen by the probability proportional to the corresponding
355transition rate T i← j . Next, using the summation of all the rates connected from the state j,

356k j =

P( ∆ t)=k j exp ⁡(−k j ∆ t). In all the MC trajectories, we begin with the initial

357Poisson process,

358state, 1DMDM+, the red motor domain in the DM state is ahead of the blue motor domain,
359which is also in the DM state. Each MC simulation is terminated at the moment when both
360motor domains are disassociated from MT (i.e., T, T*, or D state) or when the time exceeds 10s.
361For each setup, we repeated MC simulation 10000 times with different random number
362sequences.
363

We also note that the current master equation can be solved by the standard linear algebra,

364as well. We tried to solve the linear algebraic equation by an algebraic manipulation software.
365However, we did not succeed to obtain the closed formula for this large matrix. Still, one can
366solve the linear equation numerically, obtaining the exact numerical values for velocity and the
367run length. However, the MC simulation is more straightforward to analyze pathways, and thus
368we took the MC approach in this study.

of the run length from trajectory

When we determine the run-length from a trajectory, to avoid possible artefacts in the initial

372configuration, we used a scheme used in experiments[38]. First, we plotted the cumulative
373probability distribution c ( x ) (red crosses in Fig 2B) as a function of the run length x , and
374confirmed that 1−c ( x ) exhibits exponential decay for

x >1step. This is probably due to the

375Poisson process of the dynein detachment. Given the exponential behavior, we fitted

c ( x ) with

376the form,

397Kinetic

model reproduces many data on the wild-type dynein motility

398First, we examine the basic motility of our kinetic model comparing the simulation results with
399experimental data. We performed MC simulations of wild type dimeric dynein movement with
400[ATP] = 1 mM and no external force. We repeated simulations 10,000 times, from which five
401representative trajectories are shown in Fig 2A (see S2 Fig for the entire trajectories). For this
402trajectory, we see that dynein stochastically proceeded to the minus-end direction of MT for ~20
403steps before detachment from MT at ~2.2s. Interestingly, we find dynein sometime moved quite
404rapidly, but also exhibited occasional pauses. During the pauses, we find some rapid stamping
405of one motor domain (while one domain pauses in a position, the other domain moves back and
406forth many times, as in the inset of Fig 2A). The other four trajectories (drawn in grey curves in
407the figure) proceeded to the same direction and roughly with the same velocity.
408

From the 10,000 trajectories, we estimated the mean run length; for example, for the case of

409[ATP] = 1 mM, it was estimated as 3.6 ± 0.15step (Fig 2B). We plot the mean run length as a
410function of the ATP concentration [ATP] (Fig 2C). The mean run length shows a peak at around
411[ATP] = 1μM and levels off at higher [ATP]. The ATP-bound dynein, the T or T* states, has
412weak affinity to MT and thus the saturated [ATP] diminish the run length. The characteristic
413event that the run-length becomes longer with lower [ATP] was also reported in 22S dynein of
414Tetrahymena cilia and cytoplasmic dynein of mammalian [44,45].
415

We then plot the velocity as a function of the ATP concentration [ATP] (Fig 2C). For the

416velocity, we defined it as the ratio of the distance of movement to the time duration between
417long-time pauses, from which we obtained the median

v med of the velocity distribution as the

418representative value. We note there can be several other ways to define the velocity, which we
419discuss in the supporting information (S3 Fig). As [ATP] increases, the velocity increases at the
420low [ATP] and then saturates at higher [ATP], which is qualitatively consistent with
421experiments. In the saturated [ATP], each motor domain is bound by ATP for most of time and

422the ATP binding does not determine the velocity, as usual. The maximum velocity in the model
423dynein was about 6 step/s ~ 50 nm/s.
424

Experimentally, the velocity of dynein movement has been measured and known to depend

425on the species/constructs. The velocities for the full length and the GST dimer of Dictyostelium
426dynein are ~200 nm/s [46], and ~500 nm/s [47], respectively. For mammalian dynein, the DDB
427complex proceeds with 500~800 nm/s and the GST dimer velocity is ~500 nm/s [48]. For yeast,
428the full length dynein moves at the velocity ~80 nm/s [8] and the GST dimer proceeds with
429~100 nm/s [49]. Our model dynein moved with the velocity similar to that of yeast dynein
430Reasons that the model shows lower velocity than Dictyostelium dynein may be attributed to the
431choice of the low rate constant for k T ← DM which actually could dramatically change depending
432on the dimeric state [43].
433

Next, we calculated dynein motions under the external force to the backward direction, i.e.,

434towards the plus-end of MT. The estimated velocity

v med is plotted against the strength of the

435external force for a few different [ATP] in Fig 2D. With non-zero [ATP], the velocity is positive
436at low external force and becomes negative at sufficiently large force, as expected. Notably, the
437mean velocity crosses zero at the same external force (~2 pN), regardless of [ATP]. This is in
438harmony with a recent experimental result in dynein motility assays (Shima et al, manuscript in
439preparation). Another non-trivial behavior is a slight increase in the velocity with a weak
440external force of 0 - 1 pN, which we will discuss later.
441
442

We also estimated the efficiency of our model dynein. Specifically, we plotted in Fig 2E the

443median forward step numbers per one ATP hydrolysis, termed ATP efficiency for brevity, for
444several combinations of [ATP] and the external force. Focusing on the ATP efficiency in the
445absence of external force, although the run length and the velocity differ by far between [ATP]=
4461 μM and [ATP]=103 μM , the ATP efficiency changes less than 5%. Namely, the average move
447per one ATP cycle does not depend on the ATP concentration much, whereas the waiting time
448for ATP binding depends on [ATP] and thus affects the velocity at low-to-medium range of
449[ATP]. As [ATP] increases, the ATP efficiency decreases slightly from 0.71 at 1 μM , to 0.68 at
450103 μM . This is because the forward move by the power-stroke is partly canceled by the
451influence of diffusion in the weakly coupled dissociation state. When we applied the external
452force to the backward direction, we found the increase in the ATP efficiency for the range
453[ATP] = 1−103 μM and up to the force of 1pN (the efficiency reaches to ~1). Above 1.5 pN,
454the efficiency decreased. This is related to the increase in the velocity with a weak external
455force mentioned above, and we will come back to this feature in the pathway analysis later.

456Notably, with large external forces (1.5 pN and above for [ATP] = 1 μM, and 2.0 pN for the
457other [ATP]), we found a much larger variance in the ATP efficiency than the cases of weaker
458force. With large opposing force, dynein occasionally goes backwards largely and then detaches
459from MT, which makes sampling of broad data difficult.
460
461Mutants

that impair one motor domain activity

462It is an interesting feature of dimeric dynein that it can proceeds to the same direction even
463when one of motor domains lacks the ATP binding or hydrolyzing ability[11,50]. Here, to test
464our model, we performed MC simulations for the two cases that mimic the two types of
465impaired heterodimeric mutants. Fig 3A shows representative trajectories for the case where one
466motor domain does not bind ATP. Clearly, with the ATP-binding deficient mutant in one motor
467domain, it still moved to the forward direction with qualitatively similar processivity. Not
468surprisingly, during the processive movement, the intact motor domain was ahead of the mutant
469motor domain in most steps. We also see this mutant showed slightly reduced velocity and
470slightly increased run length, compared to the wildtype (grey in the figure) (Fig 3C and 3D).
471This is because the mutation leads to increase the population in the high-affinity state to MT,
472which slowed the movement and increased the processivity. Both of these effects have been
473shown in previous experiments, suggesting our model calculation qualitatively agreed with the
474experiments[50].

490and run length because the mutated motor domain stay in T or T* states with low affinity to
491MT. We also see this mutant showed slightly reduced velocity, compared to the wild-type case
492(grey in the figure) (Fig 3C and 3D). Indeed, previous experiments showed decreases in the run493length and the velocity for this mutant [50]. Thus, our model calculation qualitatively agrees
494with the experiment.
495

We note, however, that experiments showed the ATP-hydrolysis deficient mutant moves

496with larger velocity than the ATP-binding deficient mutant, which differs from our model
497calculations. We consider that our model dynein of the ATP-hydrolysis deficient mutant
498detaches from MT quickly so that it is difficult to complete ATP cycles in many trajectories,
499which makes the velocity estimate difficult.

501The bipedal mechanism:

Pathway analysis

502So far, we described overall behavior of motility in our kinetic model, showing that the model
503can reproduce many of previous experimental observations. Now, we analyze the underlying
504mechanisms emerged from our model. For this purpose, we focus on the case of [ATP] = 1 mM
505with no external force, unless otherwise denoted.
506 Fig 4 shows the whole network of the states-to-state transition dynamics, which, albeit of high
507complexity, contains full of mechanistic information. Hereafter, we decipher this complex
508network. Of the 75 states, the network contains only those that appeared in our 10000
509trajectories.

524

Starting from this ground state 26DMDM0 and following probable transitions (thick arrows,

525with the counts larger than 5000), we find a pair of probable cyclic pathways. The one that
526makes a clockwise rotation in the upper side of the figure is
527

Path 1: 26DMDM0 → 31DMT0 → 36DMT*0 → 41DMD*M0 → 51DMDM- → 55DDM-

528

→ 30DDM0 → 26DMDM0

529On this pathway, from the 26DMDM0 state to the 51DMDM- state via three transient states, the
530blue motor domain completed one ATP hydrolysis cycle while the red one remained in the DM
531state, by which the blue motor domain proceeded by one step forward via recovery-stroke and
532the subsequent power-stroke of the linker (Remember that, to distinguish two identical motor
533domains, we call the first and the second domains as the red and the blue domains,
534respectively). The 51DMDM- state is a long-lived intermediate state (star-marked in the figure).
535Subsequently, the lagging red motor domain detached from MT reaching to 55DDM-, which is
536followed by the diffusive motion of the red motor domain 30DDM0. Finally, the red domain
537rebound to the MT returning into the starting state 26DMDM0. When the dimeric dynein
538repeats this cycle more than once, this process is normally called the inchworm motion.
539Notably, during this cycle, the ATP hydrolysis reaction occurred only in the leading (blue)
540motor domain, whereas the lagging (red) motor domain is simply dragged by the leading one.
541This is in harmony with the observation that the mutants that impair motor activity still move in
542one direction. The other prominent cycle (a clockwise cycle in the bottom side of the figure),
543which is related to the first one by symmetry, is,
544

Path 1’: 26DMDM0 → 27TDM0 → 28T*DM0 → 29D*MDM0 → 1DMDM+ →

545

21DMD+ → 46DMD0 → 26DMDM0

546in which the red motor domain hydrolyzes one ATP to drive the system forward. Clearly, the
547mechanism is identical to the first cycle.
548

Thus, while the pathway analysis exhibit extremely diverse routes, we find a dominant cyclic

549pathway which corresponds to the inchworm motion.
550
551Distinct

bipedal motions

552While we found one prominent cyclic pathway, Path 1, in the previous section, due to the com553plexity of the whole network in Fig 4, we need a more systematic analysis to reveal various
554pathways. Given that each motor domain has the highest population in the DM state (S2 Table),
555we systematically seek pathways that connect the dimeric dynein states where both motor do556mains take the DM states. Among several possible combinations, we found the two cases are
557dominant; 1) the one starting from and ending to the 26DMDM0 state and 2) the other starting

558from 1DMDM+ and ending at 51DMDM- without passing through the 26DMDM0 state. We

573As described above, the leading motor domain made one ATP hydrolysis cycle driving this do574main forward by one step, whereas the lagging motor domain moved via diffusive motions
575dragged by the leading domain. In addition, we find a branch path depicted in the top row of the
576figure, in which the detached leading motor domain diffused backward, which is followed by
577the recovery-stroke and subsequently the power-stroke. Overall, the molecule returned to its
578original state and position. Moreover, we find another branch path depicted in the bottom line
579of the figure, where the detached blue motor domain diffused forward. The following steps in580clude recovery-stroke and then the power-stroke in the blue motor domain. Together, the dynein
581moved 2 steps forward, one by diffusion and the other by the power stroke. Thus, while a pair of
582linker recovery-stroke and the subsequent power-stroke in the leading domain contributes to the
583one forward step, additional diffusive motions, if any, can modulate the motions.
584

Next, we consider the paths starting from 1DMDM+ and ending at 51DMDM- without pass-

585ing through the 26DMDM0 state, of which a schematic picture is drawn in Fig 5B. Albeit high
586diversity, these paths all correspond to the hand-over-hand motions. In the 10000 trajectories,
587we identified 3328 steps of the hand-over-hand motions, which is about one fifth of the inch588worm motions (Fig 2F). This route contains many branches, but each path includes one or more
589relatively slow transition processes, making this entire route not as frequently used as the Path
5901.

591

Among the many branches during the hand-over-hand motion, the most frequently used path

592was as follows,
593

Path 2: 1DMDM+ →6DMT+ → 11DMT*+ → 36DMT*0 → 41DMD*M0 → 51DMDM-

594During the process, fueled by the ATP hydrolysis reaction cycle in the blue motor domain, the
595blue domain moved from the rear side of the red motor domain to the forward side by 2 steps,
596and thus 16 nm. We note that one of the 2 steps is via diffusive movement. More in details,
597starting from the 1DMDM+ state, the internal tension from the forward red motor domain in598duces the ADP dissociation/ ATP binding in the rear blue domain, leading to the detachment
599from the MT (6DMT+) and subsequently recovery stroke (36DMT*+). Then, the lagging blue
600domain diffuses forward (36DMT*0), which is followed by the ATP hydrolysis (41DMD*M0).
601Finally, the power-stroke in the blue domain moved the blue domain one more forward step. We
602note that in this process the one (blue) motor domain moved by two steps, one via diffusion and
603the other by the power-stroke. The other (red) motor domain remained in the DM state through604out. Interestingly, the hand-over-hand motion in the model dynein is qualitatively different from
605that of kinesin-1 (or conventional kinesin), the neck-linker docking (classically termed the
606power-stroke) occurs in the MT-bound leading head. Whereas, our model dynein uses the
607power-stroke of the lagging motor domain to move itself forward. When the dimeric dynein
608continues on this bipedal motion, the next step is that the red motor domain moves forward by
609two steps using ATP hydrolysis reaction. Therefore, mutants that impair one motor domain ac610tivity cannot move by this mechanism. There exist similar paths closely related to the Path 2,
611such as
612

Path 2’: 1DMDM+ →6DMT+ → 31DMT0 → 36DMT*0 → 41DMD*M0 → 51DMDM-

613which differs from the Path 2 only in the third state 31DMT0. These are essentially the same.
614 Occasionally, we observed that both the blue and red motor domains made diffusional move615ment during one ATP cycle in the blue domain. The path can be described as
616
617

Path 3: 1DMDM+ →6DMT+ → 31DMT0 → 56DMT- → 61DMT*- → 66DMD*M- →
70DD*M- → 45DD*M0 → 55DDM- → 51DMDM-

618This whole path contains three diffusive movements, in addition to one ATP hydrolysis cycle in
619the blue motor domain.
620

In summary, starting from the states where both motor domains are in the most stable DM

621states, we found two prominent cyclic pathways, Paths 1 and 2, which correspond to the inch622worm and the hand-over-hand motions, respectively. By counting the respective cycles in the
623trajectories, we found that the inchworm motions are more probable than the hand-over-hand

624motions for all the [ATP] and the external force conditions tested here (Fig 2F). The predomi625nance of the inchworm steps in the model dynein is in harmony with the experiment data [10].
626
627Fast-track,

slow-track, and back-step

628So far we described the inchworm and the hand-over-hand motions in the model dynein step629ping, but the whole network includes many more sub-dominant pathways. To address effects of
630dynein stepping pathway in its velocity, we classified fragments of trajectories by the short-term
631velocity defined within the fragment. Here, we define the three classes, fast-track, slow-track,
632and backward move and discuss dominant pathways in each class (we exclude the medium-ve633locity class because it corresponds to the dominant pathways discussed above). The fast-track is
634defined as the fragment of trajectories that have their velocities faster than the third quartile
635value (480 nm/s). Similarly, the slow-track is defined as those with the velocities slower than
636the first quartile value and that are positive (54 nm/s). The backward move is defined as the
637negative velocities in the fragment of trajectories.
638

First, Fig 6A depicts the fast-track pathways and its schematic mechanism. One prominent

639path starts from the 1DMDM+ state (or equivalently 51DMDM- state) and proceed via the Path
6402 (the hand-over-hand manner).
641

Path 2: 1DMDM+ →6DMT+ → 11DMT*+ → 36DMT*0 → 41DMD*M0 → 51DMDM-

642
643Fig 6. Dominant motions in different velocity regimes. (A) Fast-track motion. (B) Slow-track
644motion. (C) Backward motion. Schematic diagrams and the whole network are drawn on the left
645and the right, respectively.
646
647As above, in the fast-track pathways, there exist some small variant paths. For example, when
648the order of the recovery stroke and the diffusion is exchanged from the above path, we obtain a
649variant path depicted at the top line in the left side of Fig 6A. Alternatively, starting from the
650initial 1DMDM+ state, detachment and the diffusion of the rear domain can precede the nucleo651tide exchange reaction, which is drawn at the bottom line of the left side of Fig 6A. In summary,
652the hand-over-hand motion dominates the fast movement.
653

Next, we discuss the slow-track, of which schematic pathways are drawn in Fig 6B. The

654prominent pathway observed is
655

Path 4: 26DMDM0 → 31DMT0 → 36DMT*0 → 11DMT*+ → 16DMD*M+ →

657The first three states in this path are identical to that in the Path 1. From the 36DMT*0 state, the
658blue motor domain diffused backward (11DMT *+). Then, the blue domain was bound on the
659MT upon ATP hydrolysis (16DMD*M+), which is followed by the power-stroke to return the
66026DMDM0 state. This path was illustrated in Fig 2A at around the time 0.70 - 0.74 s where we
661see long pause with an instantaneous back step of the blue domain. Overall, the molecule did
662not proceed forward, but came back to its original location. A variant of the Path 4 is also de663picted at the bottom line of the left side of Fig. 6B. Pathways observed in the low velocity class
664always include a backward diffusion.
665 Finally, we describe the case in which the dimeric dynein moved backward. Fig 6C merged
666with Fig 6B represent a pathway,
667

Path 5: 51DMDM- → 56DMT- → 6DMT+ → 11DMT*+ → 16DMD*M+ →

668

26DMDM0

669The last three states in this path are identical to those in Path 4. A crucial feature in this pathway
670is that, in the very first transition, the leading blue domain detached from MT, which is in con671trast to the detachment of the lagging domain in the Path 2; the hand-over-hand motion. Once
672the leading blue domain is detached, it cannot diffuse forward, but can diffuse backward, due to
673the restraint from the MT-bound red motor domain. In the Path 5, the blue domain diffused
674backward by two steps, which is followed by the recovery stroke and then the power-stroke mo675tion in the blue domain. Overall, the dimeric dynein moved backward by one step.
676
677Discussion
678The observed

primary inchworm motion uses one ATP per a dimer step

679Here, we propose the kinetic model, which can reproduce extremely versatile modes of dynein
680movement. Our model suggests that the dominant pathway is the inchworm motion, which is
681about 5 times as many as the hand-over-hand motions. This is consistent with a recent report
682that classifies the modes of movements of dynein finding that about 80% of steps are of the
683inchworm type motions [10].
684

Notably, among some variants, the most prominent inchworm pathway in our model dynein,

685

Path 1: 26DMDM0 → 31DMT0 → 36DMT*0 → 41DMD*M0 → 51DMDM- → 55DDM-

686

→ 30DDM0 → 26DMDM0

687uses only one ATP hydrolysis per a dimer step. Namely, only the leading motor domain moves
688via ATP-dependent linker power-stroke coupled with a change in the stalk angle, whereas the
689lagging motor domain is moved via diffusion dragged by the leading motor domain without the
690ATP hydrolysis cycle. In this sense, the observed model is clearly different from previously

691suggested inchworm models where two ATP hydrolysis are assumed to occur per a dimer step
692(e.g., Fig. 4 in [51], Fig. 2 in [2]). It should be noted that the current model do include such a
693pathway. In Fig. 3, we find the transition from 51DMDM- to 52TDM-, which continues to make
694the following cycle,
695

Classic inchworm path: 26DMDM0 → 31DMT0 → 36DMT*0 → 41DMD*M0 →

696

51DMDM- → 52TDM- → 53T*DM- → 54DM*DM- → 26DMDM0

697where each motor domain hydrolyzes one ATP, resulting in two ATP consumption per a dimer
698step. In our model, this pathway is minor since the transition from 51DMDM- to 52TDM- oc699curs with a relatively low probability. A recent single-molecule assay measured the AAA+ ring
700angles relative to MT, finding that about 50% of motor domain steps are coupled with small an701gle changes in the AAA+ ring [52]. The Path 1 is perfectly in harmony with this result because
702only the leading motor domain takes the ATP hydrolysis cycle which exerts the force and leads
703to changes in the AAA+ ring angle. On the other hand, the classic inchworm path is not compat704ible with this single-molecule assay data because it contains twice of ATP hydrolysis cycles and
705steps and thus it takes 100% coupling between the stepping and the angle change.
706

Within our model, we assume that the stalk lean towards the MT axis by about 15 degree in

707the pre-power-stroke state, T* and D*M states, relative to the post-power-stroke state. However,
708the lifetimes of the pre-power-stroke states are rather short: From the populations in every states
709(S2 Table), we estimated the probability to have at least one pre-power-stroke state is only 15%,
710as a whole. Thus, due to short lifetimes of the pre-power-stroke states, some of these angle
711changes in the stalk might not been observed by the single-molecule assay [53].
712

It is interesting to discuss an analogy to other molecular motors that are known to use the

713inchworm motions: Some helicases and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers are known to use
714the inchworm motions to proceed along DNA [54–56]. The inchworm motions in these mole715cules are realized by two subdomains where the ATP hydrolysis is catalyzed at the interface of
716the two subdomains. In the apo-state, the subdomains are bound on DNA in an open form. Upon
717ATP binding, subdomains close by sliding one of the two subdomains on DNA by one base718pair. After ATP hydrolysis, the subdomains return to the open form by moving the other subdo719main on DNA by one base-pair, which results in the one base-pair inchworm motion. Notably,
720one ATP hydrolysis cycle is sufficient to achive one inchworm motion in these cases. Thus, this
721usage of ATP is similar to the inchworm motions found in the current simulations for the model
722dynein.
723
724The observed

23

hand-over-hand motion agrees with the previous models

725We observed the hand-over-hand motions as a sub-dominant pathway. Even though there exist
726many branch paths, a prominent one is
727

Path 2: 1DMDM+ →6DMT+ → 11DMT*+ → 36DMT*0 → 41DMD*M0 → 51DMDM-

728which is actually identical to the hypothetical model suggested previously [11,53]. In our kinetic
729model, however, this mode is sub-dominant.
730

It is interesting to note that the hand-over-hand motion in the dynein is distinct from that in

731kinesin. In kinesin, chemical events in both heads are more tightly coordinated. Starting from
732the two-head bound states, the ATP hydrolysis in the lagging head reduces its binding affinity to
733MT and results in the dissociation from the MT. The ATP-dependent neck-linker docking (clas734sically called neck-linker power-stroke) occurs in the originally leading head. On the other
735hand, the hand-over-hand motion found in our model dynein contains the full of ATP-hydroly736sis cycle in the originally lagging motor domain, while the originally leading domain stays in
737the ADP-bound state. The ATP-dependent power-stroke occurs in the originally lagging motor
738domain.
739
740Bipedal motion

under external force

741It has been suggested that a load exerted by bound cargos speeds up dynein movements by acti742vating some conformational changed. However, our model propose a possibility that this in743crease in the velocity under load is an intrinsic feature of the dynein motor domain. As in Fig
7442D, the velocity slightly increased with a weak external force; e.g., at [ATP] = 1 mM, the veloc745ity with 0.5 pN external force was larger than that without external force. This slight increase in
746the velocity under a weak opposing force was also reported in previous experimental studies
747[40,57]. The load-dependent cancellation of dynein auto-inhibition has been proposed for the
748cause of the phenomenon, however, the molecular basis for such cancellation was still obscure.
749Our model analysis may partly explain the reason for acceleration of dynein motility under a
750small backward load.
751

In order to understand the underlying mechanism of this increase, we sought the differ-

752ence in the paths with and without 0.5 pN of external force. We extracted fragments of paths
753that are significantly more frequent with the 0.5 pN force compared to the case of no force (Path
7546, depicted in Fig 7)

758Fig 7: Paths observed in the case of 0.5pN external force more frequently than the case of no
759external force. Schematic diagrams and the whole network are drawn on the left and the right,
760respectively.
761
762In the first half of the path 6, the leading red motor domain takes the ATP hydrolysis reaction,
763which inevitably peels out the lagging motor domain from MT due to the internal force. We
764then ask why this path was enhanced by the 0.5pN force. First, total incoming flows to 2TDM+
765were equally probable with and without the external force. Second, the transition from 2TDM+
766to 3T*DM+ was notably enhanced by the external force. Without the external force, the
7672TDM+ state tends to make a transition to 2TDM0 via backward diffusion of the red domain.
768The external force affects this route in two mutually opposing mechanisms: 1) The backward
769diffusion is accelerated by the external force as in eq. (5), which increases the transition to
7702TDM0. 2) The MT-bound blue motor domain receives the half of external force in 2TDM0
771state, but not in 2TDM+ state, which suggests that the 2TDM0 has extra energy cost due to ex772ternal-force based factor

f ext ( F /2 )=10(F pN), which thus reduces the transition to 2TDM0. In

773fact, the two effects are nearly cancelled out, but, in our current estimate, the second effect is
774slightly larger. This inhibitory effect to 2TDM0 explains the slight increase in the transition fre775quency to 3T*DM+. We, however, note that our estimate in the second effect comes from the
776experimental data of detachment force for Dictyostelium dynein, which contain some uncer777tainty. If the detachment force were 3 pN, for example, instead of 2 pN used here, the second ef778fect would be weaker than the first effect, and thus we may not see the slight increase in the ve779locity upon a weak external force.
780
781Effects
782

of internal force and diffusion rates

Our model contains some parameters of which appropriate values are hardly known from

783experiments to date. Here, we address effects of two such parameter values; the internal force
784factor, f ∫ ¿¿ , and the diffusion rates,
785we set f ∫ ¿=10000¿ and

λ=λ for =λback without the external force. As the default,

λ=200. Here, we repeated the same simulations with three other parame-

786ter choices and compared them with the default one (S3 Fig). (1) f ∫ ¿=10000 ¿ and
787fault set), (2) f ∫ ¿=1 ¿ and

λ=200 (the de-

λ=200 , (3) f ∫ ¿=10000 ¿ and λ=500 , and (4) f ∫ ¿=10000¿ and λ=1000 .

788We plot the results for run-lengths (S3A and S3B Fig) and velocities (S3C and S3D Fig) as
789functions of [ATP] (S3A and S3C Fig) and the external force (S3B and S3D Fig). The [ATP]

790dependence was tested with no external force. The external force dependence was investigated
791with [ATP] = 1 mM.
792

At first, the two major features were kept for all the cases. 1) The model dynein does not

793move uni-directionally without ATP. 2) The run-length decreased as [ATP] increased.
794

Looking into the effect of the diffusion rate λ , we find that all the results for the cases (1),

795(3), and (4) are rather similar each other, suggesting that the diffusion rate value does not affect
796the overall behavior significantly.
797

When we removed the effect of internal force f ∫ ¿¿ in (2)(green curves in S3 Fig), the run-

798length at higher [ATP] becomes longer, compared to the default set (1) that contains internal
799force (S3A Fig), while the velocity is significantly lower than the default case (S3C Fig). Thus,
800the system that lacks the internal force effect tends to bind more strongly to the MT, making the
801run-length longer and the velocity lower. The effect of the internal force, f ∫ ¿¿ , is to accelerate
802the dissociation of the lagging motor domain ( DM → D ), which facilitates the forward step of
803that domain increasing the velocity in one hand, and enhances the detachment of the entire
804dynein from MT thus decreasing the run length in the other hand.
805
806

Next, we examined the walking mechanisms in different f ∫ ¿¿ and λ setups (S3E Fig). It is

807clear that in the system without the internal force

f =1, the hand-over-hand moves become

808more prominent, while the inchworm moves are less probable, compared to the default case
809with the internal force. This is because the pathway; 1DMDM+
81026DMDM0, observed frequently in the default case

→ 21DMD+ → 46DMD0 →

f =10000 is less prominent for the case of

811 f =1, due to the deceleration of the first step in this pathway. In the transition 1DMDM+

→

81221DMD+, the dissociation of the lagging motor domain is facilitated by the presence of the in813ternal force. At the same time, when the lagging motor domain detaches from MT, it binds ATP
814leading to the hand-over-hand motions. Therefore, the internal force is important for the charac815teristic walking manner, inchworm motion.
816

Additionally, we also notice larger diffusion constant value shows slight increase in the

817inchworm motions. This is because the motor domain often moves diffusively twice within one
818ATP cycle in the case of large

λ value, and so the lagging motor domain tends to detach via in-

819ternal force and moves to the forward direction. When it then binds to MT, this pathway goes to
82026DMDM0, regarded as the inchworm motions.

823

As discussed, our kinetic model includes some parameters which are not derived from experi-

824ments or which are taken from experiments with mixed conditions such as different species or
825different ionic strengths. In particular, data on the effect of external force were missing for Dic826tyostelium dynein due to inherently weaker MT binding affinity of Dictyostelium dynein than
827those from yeast or human. However, since the time courses of movements have been mea828sured, we could infer these model parameters via Bayesian approaches, which is kept for future
829studies.
830

In addition, for simplicity, we limit ourselves the relative positions of the two motor do-

831mains being +8 nm, 0 nm, or -8 nm. It is straightforward to extend it to 16 nm or 24 nm to make
832it closer to experimental estimates. Limiting the relative position to discrete states is perhaps not
833an ideal setup. Extending it to continuous value would be desired. Moreover, it has been known
834that dynein occasionally make sidesteps to different protofilaments, which, for simplicity, we
835have not included in the model.
836
837
838Conclusion
839
840We proposed a kinetic model for bipedal motions of cytoplasmic dynein, simulated it via the
841Gillespie Monte Carlo method obtaining results consistent with many of previous motility ex842periments. The detailed pathway analysis provided new and versatile molecular mechanisms of
843bipedal motions of dynein, including the inchworm motions and the hand-over-hand motions.
844The kinetic model contains the 5 states of each motor domain based on the ATP-dependent
845structural changes in the linker and the MTBD, as well as 3 states for relative position of the
846two motor domain, resulting into 5 x 5 x 3 = 75 states together. The master equation in this 75
847states was solved by the Gillespie algorithm. As a result, with a single parameter set, we suc848cessfully reproduced many characteristic behavior of dynein found in previous experiments; the
849inchworm motions as the dominant mode, the hand-over-hand motions, backsteps, and stagna850tion. Our model suggests that, in the prominent inchworm movement, only the leading motor
851domain moves via the ATP-dependent linker power-stroke motions, while the lagging motor do852main is moved diffusively dragged by the leading domain. In addition, the hand-over-hand mo853tion in the model dynein is distinct from that of kinesin by the usage of the power-stroke.

859Supporting Figure Caption
860Fig S1: Effects of internal forces. The model takes into account the asymmetric detachment
861rates of the motor domain; when both domains are bound on MT, the lagging domain dissoci862ates more rapidly than the leading domain. In the master equation approach, the effect is real863ized by introducing a multyping/dividing factor, fint in the transition rates, which implies the
864changes in the free energy by ln (fint). Taking care of the detailed balance, we need to introduce
865the same factor in many transitions connected in the kinetic network. The introduced multyply866ing/dividing factors are defined in the figure.
