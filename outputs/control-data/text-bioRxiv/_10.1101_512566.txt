Abstract
The accurate determination of protein-protein interactions is an important goal of
molecular biology and much progress has been made with modern methods emerging in
the past decade. However, current methods have limitations, including scale and
restriction to high affinity interactions. This has limited our understanding of the large
subset of protein-motif interactions. Here we describe a modified bacterial-hybrid assay
that employs a combined selectable and scalable reporter system that allows the screen
of large protein-peptide libraries and their sort by relative strength. We have applied this
tool to characterize a set of human and E. coli PDZ domains. Our results are consistent
with prior characterization of these proteins and the improved sensitivity increases our
ability to predict known and novel in vivo binding partners. This approach allows for the
recovery of a wide range of affinities with a high throughput method that does not sacrifice
the scale of the screen.

Protein interactions are at the foundation of cellular processes yet our understanding of
how variation across the proteome may influence these interactions is cursory at best. In
fact, it is estimated that there are over 500,000 protein-protein interactions (PPIs)
predicted to occur in a human cell1 yet we only understand the mechanism behind a very
small fraction of these interactions. Understanding these mechanisms may help us to
predict the functional consequence of protein variations in these PPIs, a critical point to
comprehend as we now know from studies such as the 1000’s Genomes Project that
variation is prevalent from one human genome to the next2,3. These variations might alter
the coding sequence of interacting partners4 as well as influence expression levels
through modification of regulatory sequences. While we already know that common PPIs
play important roles in cellular programs5, and dysfunctional interactions are at the heart
of many diseases6, our limited understanding of the mechanisms behind most PPIs
severely restricts our ability to understand how protein variants might influence these
interactions.
Understanding the mechanism of any protein interaction can be difficult a priori. However,
some of the most common interactions are dictated by conserved domain families that
have evolved across Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota. Some of these protein domains
mediate interactions with short conserved peptide sequences commonly referred to as
short-linear motifs (SLiMs), typically comprised of <12 amino acids in disordered regions7.
Such interactions are of somewhat simpler nature than those of two globular protein
domains and are particularly common in signaling pathways. SLiM interaction domains
(SLiDs) are extremely common in metazoan proteomes with over 1000 human proteins
containing at least one of the top 5 most common (PDZ, SH3, SH2, WD40, and TPR).
While some SLiDs require post-translational modification of their target peptides8, many
do not. For example, the PDZ domain (named after the 3 proteins for which it was first
characterized PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) primarily specifies the unaltered C-terminal residues of
its binding partner though phosphorylation can block or modify this interaction 9. Unlike
eukaryotic proteomes, SLiDs appear far less common in bacteria with the minor exception
of the PDZ domain that is found in many prokaryotic species10. However, prokaryotes that
do express proteins with PDZ domains typically have a small number of these proteins or
none at all. Nevertheless, the sheer number of prokaryotic species leads to an extremely
large total number of prokaryotic PDZs11. In fact, there are more PDZ domains found in
96 common microbes of the human microbiome12 (368) than human PDZ domains
(26613). The prevalence of the PDZ domain in humans and its simplified interaction with
the C-terminus, has led to several focused studies14-17 but many of these works have
been biased by affinity, limited in scale, and largely overlook the prokaryotic PDZs.
Many high throughput screens have been employed to define PPIs18-24, however, genetic
screens and hybrid assays, in particular driven in a high-throughput manner, have had
relatively low sensitivity in detecting motif-mediated interactions. Likewise, affinitypurification mass spectrometry (AP/MS) is focused by design on high-affinity interaction
and detects few SLiD interactions. Other methods, are geared directly towards domainmotif interactions, but suffer from other shortcomings. For instance, peptide arrays23 are
limited by scale, as it’s still relatively expensive to synthesize the peptides on the array,
only a limited number of peptides can be measured. Similarly, the hold-up assay offers

quantitative affinity data, but is limited by the number of peptides measured 25. Peptide
phage display is another commonly employed method naturally suited to characterize
domain-motif interactions14,15,26. However, as a method based on enrichment over
multiple rounds, the results can be biased by affinity and specific amino-acid properties27
limiting their predictive power of lower affinity interactions that might be common in vivo.
In addition, as purifying each individual protein to screen can be laborious, any method
that requires protein expression/purification would be quite challenging to employ for an
exhaustive screen of PPIs and their variants. Moving forward, we will need a simple, fast
and accurate method to address protein-protein variation and provide a predictive model
of protein function.
Here we describe a simple, sensitive, multi-reporter bacterial 2-hybrid (MR-B2H) system
capable of capturing a dynamic range of protein interactions and enabling the accurate
prediction of known and novel in vivo protein partners. Using libraries that represent both
naturally occurring as well as purely random peptides, we characterize PDZ-peptide
interactions that represent all the C-termini a PDZ domain will encounter in a cell as well
as all mutant variants of those termini. We apply the MR-B2H system to characterize
several PDZ domains from human and E. coli proteins that have been investigated by
other common methods allowing for the benchmark of our results. We find the MR-B2H
results demonstrate an improved ability to predict known in vivo interacting partners. The
MR-B2H is a robust, rapid, and accurate method that could be adopted by almost any
lab. Some of the main benefits of the MR-B2H detailed here are (1) facile workflow
circumventing the need for protein purification and using only basic molecular biology
reagents (2) parallel and rapid characterization of protein domains, easily screening >15
domains in two-three days (3) accurate prediction of protein interactions (4) sensitive
fluorescent output captures a broad range of PPI affinities and allows an approximation
of relative activity. While we have applied this technique towards the PDZ domain it could
be easily modified to investigate other SLiDs as well as more complex protein
interactions.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Adapting the multi-reporter bacterial 1-hybrid (B1H) to a B2H. The omega (ω)-based
B1H is a well-established, robust, and rapid method for characterizing protein-DNA
interactions28-30. The strength of this system is that assays can be done in a matter of
days and multiple domains can be investigated in parallel. In addition, the system employs
the ω-subunit (rpoZ) of bacterial RNA-polymerase (RNAP) as the activation domain and
assays are conducted in an E. coli strain lacking the endogenous omega as this RNAP
subunit is non-essential. In this way recruitment of the polymerase takes place in the
absence of competition from the endogenous omega30 resulting in a highly sensitive
assay of the protein-DNA interaction. In order to adapt this system to characterize PPIs
and take advantage of the sensitivity of the omega recruitment we made the following
modifications. First, the PDZ domain of interest is expressed as a fusion to the omega
subunit from the low copy reporter plasmid (Figure 1a). Second, a 7-amino acid peptide
is expressed on the C-terminus of the Zif268 DNA-binding domain. The consensus Zif268
binding-site is placed 21 base pairs upstream of a weak minimal promoter that drives the

tandem HIS3 and GFP of the reporter plasmid. In this way, activation of the B2H system
and expression of the selectable markers HIS3 and GFP is dependent on the PDZ
interacting with the peptide: The DNA-binding domain interacts with its target and omega
will interact with the RNAP, but the two components will only be brought together on the
reporter plasmid through a positive PDZ-peptide interaction. Further, the strength of the
PPI required to survive selective pressure can be titrated by different concentrations of 3amino triazole (3AT) – a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product.
To test the functionality and demonstrate the sensitivity and dynamic range of the MRB2H, we tested nine previously characterized peptides paired with the PDZ domain of the
ERBIN protein for their combined ability to activate our GFP reporter. These peptides
were chosen from prior work as they had demonstrated a wide-range of IC50 values (3,300
fold)31 when bound to the ERBIN PDZ. Cells that expressed the omega-Erbin PDZ
domain and the zif268-peptide fusion were challenged for their ability to activate the GFP
reporter. Known lower-affinity interactions drove less GFP expression than high-affinity
interactions (Figure 1b), but were still distinguishable from negative controls. Importantly,
documented ERBIN PDZ-peptide interactions found in the mentha database32 clustered
in the lowest tier of GFP expression (Figure 1c). This data suggested that the MR-B2H
system captures a wide range of affinities, and that many relevant interactions would be
found in the lower GFP range.
Characterization of PDZ specificity
Having demonstrated the ability to capture a wide range of affinities, we next tested our
ability to select positive PDZ-peptide interactions from large libraries. We constructed a
purely random 7 amino acid library as well as a library comprised of ~50,000 naturally
occurring 7 amino acid C-termini found in humans (templated from prior work)15.
Combined, these libraries allow us to investigate peptides a PDZ would be exposed to in
nature in addition to all possible variations of these peptides. While the build of the random
library approached 1010 variants, the 109 transformation efficiency of E. coli limits the
practicality of sampling fractions of this library greater than 10 9 in a single experiment.
Therefore, all selections reported here are based on a sampling of roughly 10 9 members
of our random library. The natural library of only 50,000 members was easily oversampled
with a typical sampling 5x107 variants in each selection, representing a 1,000-fold over
sample.
To demonstrate the method’s ability to select positive interactions from our libraries and
generate results rapidly, we carried out MR-B2H selections as previously described for
B1H selections30,33 relying only on HIS3 activation. Selections were plated on a range of
3-amino triazole (3AT) concentrations, and individual colonies were screened for
surviving library members by colony PCR or pooled and barcoded for Illumina sequencing
(Figure 1d). As might be expected, the pools of library members recovered from lower
stringency selections were more diverse than those from higher stringency selections.
We initially performed selections against 4 PDZ domains from eukaryotic proteins, and 6
PDZ domains from 4 prokaryotic proteins. 3/4 eukaryotic PDZ domains yielded
specificities matching known binding preferences (with Scribble PDZ 3 having too few

colonies to obtain reliable information), and at least one PDZ worked for 3/4 prokaryotic
proteins (with the PRC PDZ domain failing selection) (Figure 1e, and Supplemental
Figure 1). Importantly, the motif from DegS PDZ alone matches closely to the motifs34
from the full-length protein (expressed as a catalytically active wild-type, or catalytically
impaired mutant35) indicating that a domain-based screening approach can be informative
of full-length protein binding as well. This entire workflow can be accomplished in as little
as 3 days (Figure 1f), highlighting this method as a rapid and facile approach for
characterizing SLiDs.
The B2H system captures a wide range of affinities
To expand on the multi-stringency selections, we took a complementary approach to
leverage GFP expression as a relative measure of interaction strength. Rather than
relying on 3AT stringency to select strength of interaction in a step-wise manner, we used
GFP fluorescence as a continuous measure of interaction strength. However, to clear
nonfunctional members from the library we first needed to perform a weak 3AT selection
on plates (typically 1mM 3AT). We then pooled surviving members and expanded in liquid
media under the same weak selective pressure until GFP fluorescence approached its
maximum. The GFP populations were sorted representing low, medium and high GFP
(Figure 2a). A negative GFP population was also recovered to provide a baseline control.
Consistent with the results from the plate selections, we found a more diverse set of
peptides in lower GFP populations, while a more restricted set of peptides were required
for maximal GFP activation (Figure 2b). In fact, we find that in general, motifs compiled
from lower GFP bins more closely resemble the diversity of interacting partners that are
found in vivo. For example, the low GFP results for the ERBIN PDZ domain more closely
resemble results from peptide array36 as well as confirmed in vivo binders curated from
mentha32 (Figure 2b bottom). On the other hand, motifs from the high-GFP expressing
populations lead more towards the high affinity consensus targets produced by phagedisplay. Further support of these trends relating affinity and GFP comes from the
distribution of peptides with documented affinities across GFP. Consistent with results
above, we find an enrichment of lower affinity interactions (>50uM) in low GFP pools, and
higher affinity interactions (<10uM) in the high GFP populations (Figure 2c). Utilizing the
GFP component of the MR-B2H enhances the data by providing a continuous separation
of PPI strengths but adds an additional 4-5 days to the workflow described in Figure 1f,
(Figure 2d).
This workflow was performed for 9 previously characterized PDZs from 6 eukaryotic
proteins, including the ERBIN PDZ, DLG4 PDZ3, SCRIB PDZ1 and PDZ3, MAGI1 PDZ2,
3, and 4, MPDZ PDZ10 and TIAM1 PDZ1. We successfully measured the specificities of
8/9 of these PDZs in good agreement with previous work, with the TIAM1 PDZ1 being the
only PDZ that failed in the B2H assay. Additionally, 3 PDZs which had been attempted in
phage display but failed to produce motifs were successfully characterized, including
DLG4 PDZ1 and PDZ2, and APBA1 PDZ1 (Supplemental Figure 2 and 3).

Predictions of known interactions are improved by models incorporating lower
affinity binders
One goal of this project is to produce a system that captures a more representative group
of peptides that interact with domains like PDZ’s in order to improve our capacity to predict
novel interactions. Utilizing published phage display results as a comparison15, we
interrogated the data from our selections of the Natural Library. After filtering selection
data to enrich for high confidence binders (see Methods), we plotted the distribution of
recovered known “annotated” binders across GFP populations (Figure 3a). Annotated
binders are found in all three GFP populations, however in most cases, the lower GFP
populations contain a greater proportion of these peptides, supporting the notion that
there is a wealth of lower-affinity interactions that may be overlooked by methods biased
towards the high affinity. Furthermore, the absolute recovery of known interactors by MRB2H selections is 4-10-fold higher than phage display (Figure 3b). To control for false
discovery rates and directly compare to phage display results, we then built position
weight matrices (PWMs) from MR-B2H-derived peptides found in either low or high GFP
populations, as well as phage display-derived peptides, and scored each C-terminus of
known partners. With a false-discovery rate set to 0.01, we found that in most cases, the
highest number of known binders passed the cutoff when compared to the PWM derived
from low-GFP B2H peptides (Figure 3c). Stated simply, PWMs derived from a broader
set of PPI affinities and characteristics recover a higher number of known binders than
PWMs based on more restrictive information. Phage-display-derived peptides are known
to be strong and hydrophobic binders27, but lack the affinity range captured by MR-B2H
selection, hence binding profiles (e.g., expressed as PWMs) derived from them often fail
to capture important interactions. In sum, these results demonstrate that incorporating a
richer spectrum of interaction affinities into our models significantly improves our ability
to predict known interactions.
The prediction of novel interaction partners underscores the utility of MR-B2H data
The agreement between our MR-B2H data and previous screens carried out by phage
display14,15 and protein microarrays16,36 validates the accuracy of our technique. In
addition, the improved prediction of known in vivo binding partners with MR-B2H data
(Figure 3) demonstrates the importance of the expanded affinity profile for detecting real
full-length protein interactions. However, many recovered peptides were not from known
interacting partners and we next set out to determine if these represent false positive or
novel true positive interactions. That said, it is important to note that the possibility of
interaction does not imply biological function or purpose but simply that if two proteins are
present in the same cell they have the potential to interact. Further, it is beyond the scope
of this work to thoroughly investigate the biological implications of each novel prediction
of PDZ and peptide pairings. Rather, we aim to demonstrate this tool is able to accurately
predict the possibility of in vivo interacting partners that others might follow up in future
works. With this goal in mind, we turned to another hybrid assay that would express a set
of full-length proteins in human cells to test for positive interactions.

interacting partners. A) Plotted counts of selected peptides matching C-termini of annotated in
vivo partners. Empty box indicates total annotated C-termini passing the reads-threshold after
round 1 selection. Green bars depict the number of annotated matches within each GFP level.
B) Comparison of the absolute number of matches to previously reported PDZ partners
recovered by either Phage Display or MR-B2H selection. C) Comparison of the number of Ctermini identified as binders using a PWM built using phage-display selected peptides (blue
line) and MR-B2H-selected peptides from the Random library for low and high GFP (light and
dark green lines, respectively). The C-termini of all previously described partners was scored.
The threshold for each PWM was set to ensure an FDR of 0.01 for phage display and MR-B2H
PWMs (dashed lines).

Since the PDZ domain is often found in proteins orchestrating scaffolding interactions at
the cell membrane37, we chose to focus our human cell validation on the PSD-95 (gene
name DLG4), a neuronal membrane protein containing 3 PDZ domains. We characterized
the target specificity of each PSD-95 PDZ domain (Supplemental Figures 2 and 3) and
not surprisingly found that many of the predicted partners map to intermembrane proteins.
To validate these predictions, we used the mammalian membrane 2-hybrid system
(MaMTH)38-40 to investigate a small set novel predicted partners (Figure 4a). This system
utilizes the reconstitution of a split ubiquitin molecule that only happens when two
interacting partners brings these halves in close proximity to one another. The
reconstitution leads to cleavage of a transcription factor and its subsequent transport to
the nucleus where it activates the reporter gene luciferase. In this way, luciferase
activation is a measure of the interacting partners at the membrane. Using this method,
we tested a set of five predicted partners (four novel: ACVR2B, LRNF4, ATP2B2, and

SLC2A1. One known: FZD7) with each of the PDZ domains alone as well as the fulllength protein (Supplemental Figure 4). Luciferase activity was significantly increased
over the controls for all of these interactions with the full-length protein (Figure 4b) and
for 4/5 interacting partners with the single PDZ domains (Supplemental Figure 4).
Interestingly, while still significantly above controls, the luciferase activity decreased for
4/5 of the interactions with the full-length protein in comparison to any of the individual
PDZ domains. In addition, the one exception, SLC2A1, significantly increases luciferase
output with the full-length but not a fragment that contains all 3 PDZ domains. These
results imply that the PDZ interaction may be very weak as luciferase activity is slightly
increased (though not significant) for each PDZ domain, but the more than doubling of
reporter output with the full-length protein is likely due to an additional interaction in the
protein. This secondary interaction may or may not require the weak PDZ interaction, but
determining this interplay would require detailed follow up investigations. Regardless,
these results demonstrate that the MR-B2H data was able to successfully predict 4/4
novel full-length interacting partners with PSD-95.

The MR-B2H provides insight into the specificities of bacterial PDZ domains
The specificities of prokaryotic PDZ domains have been largely ignored outside of a
handful of E. coli proteins. One potential complication for the prokaryotic domains is the
genes that code for them often contain a protease domain. Expressing a functional
protease in a hybrid assay could prove problematic. However, structures of the DegS
proteins reveal that the protease domain is in close proximity to the peptide bound to the

PDZ domain41 indicating that this
interaction may influence specificity.
Therefore, to test the ability of the
MR-B2H system to characterize
these prokaryotic domains we first
focused on the DegS protein. Using
the Random library we tested DegS
as the PDZ domain alone, as the fulllength protein including the protease
domain, and a mutant version of the
protein that reduces the catalytic
activity of the protease (Figure 5).
The DegS peptide preference is in
agreement with prior investigation of
this domain34. Further, we find only
subtle differences between the 3
versions of the proteins with the fulllength versions enriching for an
Arginine at the -1 position not found
with the PDZ domain alone.
Therefore, the PDZ domain alone
appears to provide at least an
approximation of the full-length
specificity. Also, our experiments
demonstrated no signs of toxicity
when we overexpress this E. coli
protease in our E. coli-based system
indicating that investigation of other
PDZ-proteases are not likely to be
problematic in our system. Next, we
screened the PDZ domains of 3
other E. coli proteins DegP, DegQ,
and PRC. Only PRC failed to enrich

this would make it difficult to
distinguish

was
responsible for binding the peptide. Regardless, for the PDZs successfully characterized,
their peptide preferences are in agreement with published work42,43 validating the MRB2H system’s ability to characterize prokaryotic domains in addition to their eukaryotic
counterparts.

Conclusions
Here we describe a rapid, sensitive, and accurate hybrid system enabling the parallel
characterization of PPIs in as little as three days. Relative activity of interactions can be
obtained in as little as four to five additional days. We showcase the MR-B2H using the
PDZ domain, one of the most prevalent SLiDs in human. We successfully apply this
method to 8/9 human PDZ domains previously characterized by peptide phage-display,
as well as 2 domains that had failed. Additionally, we identify a novel motif for the human
APBA PDZ domain. Finally, we characterize 3 PDZ domains from E. coli and demonstrate
the successful capture of protein-ligand interactions even when these PDZ domains are
expressed as full-length proteins and include a functional protease. In all cases the
specificities produced are in agreement with prior work (when available) demonstrating
the accuracy of the technique. As a result, the combined speed, throughput and accuracy
of this method should make it useful for future studies of PDZ domain proteins as well as
other common SliDs. In addition, the simplicity of the assay allows for its employment by
any lab skilled in basic molecular biology techniques.
The goal of any high throughput technique is to accurately capture the true activity of a
protein in vivo. Therefore, our goal was to create a tool that would improve our ability to
predict in vivo binding partners, first for PDZ domains, but with the potential to expand to
other protein domains. While prior methods to characterize these domains have sacrificed
throughput or sensitivity14-16,36, the MR-B2H system allows the screen of large libraries
without sacrificing the capture of a broad range of affinities. We believed that the capture
of a wide range of affinities without sacrificing scale would enable better prediction of in
vivo binding partners. We find this to be true as our MR-B2H data is better able to predict
known in vivo interacting partners than prior works and our MaMTH studies demonstrate
the accurate prediction of novel binding partners.
The application of this method could be beneficial in several ways. First, the simple
selection of interactions at high stringency from plates can provide a consensus binding
motif for a protein within 3 days. Second, application of low stringency selections, or low
GFP recovery, can provide a broader understanding of the domain-peptide interaction.
Scaled and applied to a large set of domains, the mechanistic fundamentals of the
domain’s function may be gleaned. As compared to phage display, the nature of our
method sidesteps the laborious and often difficult need to generate a functional purified
protein in vitro. This approach has been applied to many DNA-binding domains28-30,44,45
and the sensitivity of the MR-B2H system may enable a similar approach to understand
SLiD function. Finally, the simplicity and throughput of this technique allows the seamless
application of multiple libraries. The comparison of the natural library with a purely random
library allows us to investigate what peptides a protein might interact with in a given cell,
as well as how mutations in the peptide might alter the interaction. Therefore, this
comprehensive approach allows us to understand how variation in peptides alter protein
recognition. Further the GFP assay allows for a rough quantification of how slight variation
in the peptide may influence the relative strength of the interaction. As it has become
clear that variation across human genomes is prevalent2, understanding variation in PPIs,
especially those that can influence low affinity interactions, will be critical as we try to
decipher whether a variant is harmful or benign.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Library and plasmid construction
The Random and Natural libraries were generated as previously described46. Plasmids
were generated via routine restriction enzyme cloning, and will be made available at
Addgene. Additional details can be found in the Supplemental information.
Selections on plates
Selections in the B2H assay were performed as previously described for B1H
selections30,33,45 with cells plated on minimal media (NM) that lacked histidine but
supplemented with various levels of 3AT. Surviving colonies were sequenced.
Selections in liquid culture
To separate positive PDZ-peptide interactions by GFP expression 109 cells were plated
on NM media plates lacking histidine but containing 1mM 3AT and grown for 24 hours to
enrich for the somewhat rare positive interactions (typically <10 5 colonies survived out of
the 109 plated). Surviving colonies were scraped and DNA was extracted to yield ‘round
1’ libraries. 50ng of round 1 libraries, or the 5 alanine peptide negative control, were
retransformed with 1 g of the same PDZ plasmid. 106 cells were grown in selective NM
media supplemented with 1mM 3AT for up to 36 hours. Four GFP populations (negative,
low, medium, and high) were sorted and collected from a time-point when GFP
approached its maximum. Cells from these sorted pools were plated on rich media and
grown overnight. The surviving colonies where pooled, DNA barcoded, and deepsequenced.
Next-generation Sequencing
PCR primers that included the illumina adaptor sequences were used to amplify peptide
coding sequences from the plate selections as well as recovered GFP populations.
Reactions were gel purified and mixed in equimolar ratios before being run a
NextSeq4000 with 30% PhiX DNA to increase diversity. Results were de-multiplexed and
peptide counts were tallied.
MaMTH validation assays
MaMTH assays were carried out as previously described38. In short, bait and prey
plasmids were transfected into HEK293 MaMTH reporter cells, expression was induced
with tetracycline, and luciferase activity was measured 24 hours post induction.
Bioinformatics analysis
For each PDZ domain a PWM was generated from the peptides recovered from each
population considered, including all plate stringencies and GFP populations. For
comparison, PWMs were also produced from the previously published phage displayderived peptides. In addition, the interacting partners of each target protein were collected
from the protein-protein interaction database MENTHA32. The C-terminus of each protein
annotated as a partner was scored for each PWMs. After scoring, a threshold needed to
be set for separating positive and negative predictions. The simplest approach is to set a
common log-likelihood threshold for all motifs. Unfortunately, log-likelihood distributions

substantially vary across motifs, and the same threshold value may result in
underestimating occurrences for one motif and overestimating them for another.
Therefore, several score distribution-based approaches for threshold selection were
proposed47. We selected a method based on controlling the false positive rate, which has
proven to be the least biased by the information content of the motif and therefore the
most consistent between motifs. Consequently, we compared the performance of each
PWM in the dataset of known partners by applying a fixed FDR of 0.0148.
The accumulated hydrophobicity value was calculated as the sum of each amino acid
hydrophobicity weight, multiplied by each amino acid normalized frequency in the PWM
over each position15.
A more detailed version of each method can be found in the supplemental
information.
