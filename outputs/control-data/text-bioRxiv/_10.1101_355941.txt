HYPEROXIA ON BRAIN ACTIVITY

Abstract

Recreational use of concentrated oxygen has increased. Claims have been made that hyperoxic
breathing can help reduce fatigue, increase alertness, and improve attentional capacities;
however, few systematic studies of these potential benefits exist. Here we examined the effects
of short-term (15 minute) hyperoxia on resting-states in awake human subjects by measuring
spontaneous EEG activity between normoxic and hyperoxic situations, using a within-subjects
design for both eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions. We also measured respiration rate, heart
rate, and blood oxygen saturation levels to correlate basic physiological changes due to the
hyperoxic challenge with any brain activity changes. Our results show that breathing short term
100% oxygen led to increased blood-oxygen saturation levels, decreased heart rate, and a slight,
but non-significant, decrease in breathing rate. Changes of brain activity were apparent,
including decreases in low-alpha (7-10 Hz), high-alpha (10-14 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz), and gamma
(30-50 Hz) frequency ranges during eyes-opened hyperoxic conditions. During eyes-closed
hyperoxia, increases in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and theta (3.5-7 Hz) frequency range were apparent
together with decreases in the beta range. Hyperoxia appeared to accentuate the decrease of low
alpha and gamma ranges across the eyes-opened and closed conditions suggesting that it
modulated brain state itself. As decreased alpha during eyes-opened conditions has been
associated with increased attentional processing and selective attention, and increased delta and
theta during eyes-closed condition are typically associated with the initiation of sleep, our results
suggest a state-specific and perhaps opposing influence of short-term hyperoxia.

HYPEROXIA ON BRAIN ACTIVITY

Introduction

Over the past decade, recreational use of oxygen (O2) has increased, and oxygen
providers have suggested therapeutic benefits of using O2 to reduce stress, boost energy, and
increase alertness (Bren, 2002), yet, there is little evidence to validate these benefits (Walsh,
Thimmesch, D'Achiardi, & Pierce, 2011). Both hypoxic and hyperoxic states can be induced in
the body by respectively decreasing or increasing the fractional O2 concentration (normally 21%)
in inhaled gas. Intermittent exposure to hypoxia has been associated with global impairments in
executive functioning (Saunamäki, Himanen, Polo, & Jehkonen, 2009), sleep disturbances
(Hamrahi, Stephenson, Mahamed, Liao, & Horner, 2001), cardiovascular and metabolic
problems (Marin, Carrizo, Vicente, & Augusti, 2005; Levy et al., 2008) and the induction of
neuronal apoptosis (Xu et al., 2004). Given that hypoxia is associated with physiological and
brain function impairments, is the opposite true for hyperoxia? That is, are there neural and
cognitive benefits of inducing a short term hyperoxic state?
In view of the fact that the brain has high metabolic requirements, and since metabolic O2
consumption in the brain appears to correspond very well to the degree of neuronal/functional
activation on a moment to moment basis (Raichle & Mintun, 2006; Magistretti & Allaman,
2015), it stands to reason that providing additional oxidative substrate to the brain might well
produce measurable changes in its functional electrophysiological state. Previous work has
shown that hyperoxia induces changes in basic physiological parameters such as breathing and
heart rate and in turn, these changes may directly or indirectly affect brain state or function
(Berssenbrugge et al., 1983; Colrain et al., 1987; Desai et al., 2015; Pack et al., 1992; Tsanov et
al. 2014; Yackle et al., 2017). Indeed, hyperoxia is also known to induce changes in cerebral
blood flow (Bergo and Tyssebotn 1995; Bew et al., 1994; Busija et al., 1980; Floyd et al., 2003;

Kety and Schmidt, 1948; Lund et al., 1999; Watson et al., 2000), which might also be expected
to result in a functional change in the operation of the brain even given the fact that cerebral
blood flow and brain state can show independence from each other, despite their typical tight
correspondence (Bangash et al. 2008; Braun et al. 1997; Hajak et al. 1994; Hofle et al. 1997). In
terms of pathological influences, there are also deleterious consequences of hyperoxia due to the
production of reactive oxidative species (ROS), however, the exposure times necessary to
observe these effects are quite long (~ 6 hours in normobaric conditions).
We have previously observed that providing 100% oxygen to spontaneously breathing
urethane-anesthetized and naturally sleeping rats with implanted cortical and hippocampal
electrodes shifts forebrain states towards more deactivated slow-wave (≤1Hz) patterns (Whitten
et al., 2009; Hauer et al, 2018). This suggests that ongoing oscillatory EEG measures of brain
state may be an effective assay for the effects of hyperoxia and that (perhaps paradoxically)
excess oxygen may promote EEG rhythms that are typically associated with decreased levels of
arousal. Two human studies appear to indicate this as well. In the first, breathing 100% oxygen
appeared to increase coupling in the “default mode network” (Wu et al., 2014), a group of brain
regions that show more activation during baseline, sleeping and anesthetized conditions, as
compared to instances of alert processing (Raichle, 2015). In the second, increasing inhaled
oxygen content to 35% produced an increase in delta (1-4Hz) activity together with a decrease in
both beta and gamma power (Seo et al., 2007). In a further independent study, however, no
significant EEG changes were observed following a one-hour period of breathing 100% O2
(Kaskinoro et al., 2008). In another, Croal et al. (2015), reported decreases in occipital lobe alpha
and beta oscillations using MEG, but without any concomitant changes in cerebral blood flow. In
all these studies, however, behavioural state was not controlled and the influence of

physiological variables such as respiratory and heart rate changes were not taken into account. A
recent study, however, reported decreases in EEG alpha activity during sustained-attention and
task-evoked conditions, comparing 5-minute interleaved oxygen and control blocks (Sheng et al.,
2017). While this study did control behavioural state under alert, sustained attention conditions,
there has still been no systematic evaluation of the impact of hyperoxia on EEG oscillations in
resting-state conditions.
In the present study, we examined short term (15 minute) influence of breathing 100%
oxygen on resting-state EEG during wakefulness in two simple situations that produce prominent
state-dependent differences in the production of alpha activity: eyes-opened and eyes-closed
conditions. We ensured that oxygen saturation was maximised during the hyperoxic condition
and we also monitored both respiratory and cardiac rhythms during our manipulations. We show
that hyperoxia has a state-dependent and complex influence on brain activity that may indicate
enhanced attention during eyes-opened conditions while promoting the initiation of sleep when
the eyes are closed.
Method
Procedure
Figure 1 illustrates the experimental protocol used. The experiment consisted of 4 blocks
wherein either 100% oxygen or regular air was administered at a controlled flow rate for ~15
minutes each. The order of the gases provided was counterbalanced across subjects. Within each
block, participants completed an alternating eyes-opened/eyes-closed resting-state condition,
again in an ABAB design, for 3 minutes each. The eyes-closed condition was always the first
and third trial, and the eyes-opened task was always the second and fourth trial. There were ~3
minutes between each block to allow for blood oxygenation measurements. Participants were

blind both to the design of the study as well as their condition. We collected data from 26 right
handed participants (Mean age = 22.2, range = 18 – 38, 18 female), all of whom had normal or
corrected vision and were screened for relevant medical or neurological illnesses. All
participants gave informed consent and were compensated for their time. The Health Research
Ethics Board at the University of Alberta approved all experimental procedures.
EEG data recording and preprocessing
EEG data was recorded with a 32-channel BrainAmp DC system (Brain Products) inside
a radio-frequency attenuated chamber. Data were recorded from silver-silver chloride electrodes
affixed to an EEG cap. Electrical impedance between the skin and electrodes were reduced to
less than 10 kΩ. Data were recorded at 1000 Hz, with a bit depth of 0.1 μV, with hardware
bandpass filters between .015 Hz and 250 Hz. We additionally had two pairs of bipolar vertical
and horizontal EOG electrodes placed around the eyes (same amplifier settings), and a
respiration belt transducer and a finger pulse oximeter to measure respiration and heart rate
(Arbitrary Units, DC recording), all synchronized with the EEG data using a BrainAmp ExG
auxillary and bipolar amplifier (Brain Products). A second battery operated pulse-oximeter to
measure oxygen saturation levels in the blood (SpO2) was affixed to the finger and used at the
start of blocks to confirm oxygen levels. Room air or 100% oxygen was delivered through an
unsealed gas delivery mask, allowing 2 minutes before the start of each 15-minute block to allow
the oxygen to be taken up by the body. Blood oxygenation level was measured at the start and
end of this 2-minute period.
All data was processed in MATLAB using EEGLAB toolbox functions (Delorne &
Makeig, 2004). Raw traces were segmented into 180 second epochs locked to the onset of each
trial corresponding to the following conditions: normoxia eyes-opened, normoxia eyes-closed,

hyperoxia eyes-opened, and hyperoxia eyes-closed, resulting in four 3-minute epochs within
each condition, and 16 trials total per participant. An additional 9s was taken before and after
each trial to avoid edge artifacts. Eye movements were corrected with a regression-based
procedure (Gratton, Coles, & Donchin, 1983). No other form of artifact correction was used.
Time frequency Analysis
We transformed our 3-minute segments into time-frequency space by convolving the data
with a Morlet wavelet 6 cycles in length and for 100 logarithmically sampled frequencies from 1
– 50Hz. These raw power values were log-transformed and averaged within each segment,
resulting in four trial averages within each condition. These trial averages were then themselves
averaged, resulting in a measure of the average raw power at each frequency, for each of the 4
conditions, for each electrode, and for each participant.
In addition to the analysis of the oscillatory power, we used the BOSC (Better
OSCillation detection) method, introduced by Caplan et al. (2001) and recently revised by
Whitten, Hughes, Dickson, and Caplan (2011). The BOSC method is designed to detect
consistent oscillatory activity in EEG signals by modelling the functional form of the nonrhythmic background activity and employing two thresholding procedures to ensure the presence
of oscillatory activity, using one threshold for amplitude and one for duration. Our procedure
was as follows. The average wavelet power across the entire experimental session was used to
estimate the parameters of the spectral background function (a natural property of autocorrelated
time-series signals such as EEG (Schlesinger & West, 1988)) and was assumed to be described
by the equation Power(f) = Af-α. The session-averaged wavelet spectrum was log-transformed,
and a linear regression of these values on frequency in log-log space was computed, resulting in
an intercept, corresponding to log(A), and a slope, corresponding to -α. It is possible to consider

this fitted value (Power(f)) as the mean of the theoretical χ2(2) distribution for expected power
values, allowing us to create probability distribution functions for the background power at every
frequency. The power threshold, PT, is chosen such that observed power values exceeding the
95th percentile of this distribution were considered oscillatory. The duration threshold, DT, was
set such that the wavelet power must have exceeded the power threshold for at least 3 cycles of
the given frequency. The end result was a binary value of “detected” or “undetected” for every
point in time-frequency space, which is summarized by the “Pepisode”, the proportion of time
oscillations of a given frequency are detected in a given period. The four trials per condition
were averaged, resulted in one value of Pepisode for each frequency, condition, electrode, and
participant.
The raw power and Pepisode values were averaged across all participants and across all
electrodes to demonstrate the gross differences between the four conditions. Examining eyesclosed and eyes-opened trials separately, we performed a cluster-based statistical analysis of the
effect of hyperoxia across frequencies and electrodes (Bew, Field, Droste, & Razis, 1994; Desai,
Tailor, & Bhatt, 2015; Kety & Schmidt, 1948; Pack, Cola, Goldszmidt, Ogilvie, & Gottschalk,
1992; Tsanov, Chah, Reilly, & O’Mara, 2014). The effect of hyperoxia was assessed at every
electrode and every sampled frequency by a two-tailed uncorrected paired t-test with an alpha set
to 0.05. In order to minimize false alarms, only effects that consistently spanned across several
clustered electrodes were considered. We defined an electrode cluster as a spatial array of at least
three mutually adjacent electrodes showing significant differences in a common direction. Based
on this criterion, bands of frequencies were identified which indicated an effect of hyperoxia, and
the t-statistics for each electrode were averaged across the frequencies within the band and
plotted as a scalp topography. The electrode with the largest t-statistic was selected to represent

the locus of the statistical difference on the scalp, and a final uncorrected two-tailed paired tstatistic for the mean power or Pepisode difference within this frequency range and at this single
electrode was calculated and reported. The difference spectra, hyperoxia minus normoxia, was
also computed and plotted, to present at a single electrode the magnitude and variability of the
difference hyperoxia produces across the spectrum. The electrode with the largest t-statistic was
chosen to represent this difference, but in some cases was chosen to best reflect the most
theoretically interesting results for that condition.
In addition to examining the effect of hyperoxia on the eyes-opened and eyes-closed
trials separately, we were also interested in the effect of hyperoxia on the transition between one
eye-condition to the next. The average wavelet power was computed within each of the four
oxygen conditions (2 trials of hyperoxia, 2 trials of normoxia), instead of across the whole
session, to estimate separate PT thresholds within each oxygen condition and recompute the
Pepisode measure for each eye-condition. This analysis allowed the relative power and Pepisode to be
compared within oxygen blocks without being affected by the variability between the blocks. At
every electrode and frequency, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was performed, with an
alpha set to 0.05, and using the uncorrected F-statistic for the eye by oxygen interaction as our
indication of significance across electrodes. The same statistical analyses was performed as
described above using this F-statistic.
We performed two additional analyses with the aim of examining in more detail how the
patterns of oscillatory activity were changing between the gas conditions. The first consisted of a
restricted power analysis where time points not classified as “detected” within a given frequency
were excluded from the estimation oscillatory power. Oscillation power is often interpreted as
reflecting the amplitude of an oscillation, however, this is not necessarily true. As the proportion

of an EEG signal which is oscillatory (Pepisode) increases or decreases, the estimation of power
across that signal will also increase or decrease, although the amplitude of the oscillations are in
fact identical. We returned to the frequency bands which showed a significant effect of
hyperoxia on the Pepisode within an eye condition, and re-estimated the power in these ranges by
averaging across only detected oscillations within a trial, and then averaging this value across the
4 trials per condition as above to obtain one measure of the “detected raw power” within each
condition which is not affected by differences in the prevalence of oscillations between
conditions. This measure was calculated at frequencies and electrodes already shown in the
previous analyses so as to present the most comparable data to our more standard analyses. An
uncorrected two-tailed paired t-test was performed on the detected power within this range and
the means, standard deviations, and t-statistics for this test are reported.
We lastly examined whether the differences observed due to both factors could be
explained by changes in the length, measured in cycles, of the detected oscillatory epochs. The
number of cycles was defined as the duration that an individual oscillatory segment remained
over the power threshold PT, and excluding durations less than 3 cycles for failing to meet the
minimum duration threshold DT. This analysis was restricted to the alpha range represented in
Figure 3G because that is the only range which contains enough separate oscillatory epochs to
allow a stable estimation of the number of cycles. The number and duration of detected
oscillatory epochs were identified within the aforementioned frequency range, and at the
electrode with the largest test statistic for the interaction presented in Figure 3G. The oscillatory
epoch counts were pooled both across trials and across participants, due to the low numbers of
oscillatory epochs per subject (typically less than 30). Histograms of the number of cycles from
the eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions were plotted, overlaid so as to demonstrate the shift

in the alpha distribution that is caused by closing the eyes. The MATLAB function ecdf() –
which uses the Kaplan-Meier nonparametric method for empirically estimating the cdf of a
population from observed data – was used to estimate the cumulative distribution function (cdf)
for these four distributions. Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests were used to test if the
hyperoxia distribution would be shifted towards longer or shorter number of cycles than the
normoxia distribution in both the eyes-closed and eyes-opened conditions.
Results
Physiological measurements
Exposure to hyperoxia elevated pulse oxygen saturation levels significantly across
participants (Figure 2A), demonstrating that the oxygen delivery was effective in our participants
(t(25) = 9.75, p < 0.001). The experiment consisted of 4 blocks wherein either 100% oxygen or
regular air was administered at 3 l/min for ~15 minutes each. Consistent with the literature,
hyperoxia had a slight but non-significant slowing effect on breathing rate in eyes-opened (t(25)
= .968 , n.s.) and eyes-closed conditions (t(25) = .701, n.s.; Figure 2B), and significantly lowered
heart rate in both the eyes-opened (t(25) = 4.87, p < 0.001) and eyes-closed (t(25) = 3.06, p <
0.01) conditions (Figure 2C). We performed a homoscedastic two-sample uncorrected t-test on
the SpO2 difference, hyperoxia minus normoxia, between hyperoxia-first subjects and normoxia
subjects, resulting in a trend for a larger difference in normoxia-first subjects (2.9 %) than
hyperoxia-first subjects (2.2 %), but this was not significant (t(12) = 1.96, p = 0.073). We also
performed the same test on the difference in breathing rate and heart rate which showed that the
counterbalancing order did not alter the effect of hyperoxia on breathing rate (eyes-opened: t(12)
= 0.77, p = 0.46; eyes-closed: (t(12) = 1.00, p = 0.34), however counterbalancing order did
significantly alter the effect of hyperoxia on heart rate in the eyes-closed condition (t(12) = 2.82,

p = 0.016) and showed a trend in the eyes-open condition (t(12) = 2.02, p = 0.066), although due
to the presence of a significant outlier in one subject (See Figure 2C) these effects may not be
reliable. For every statistical test of observed spectral differences described below, a correlation
was made between the observed difference and the measures of breathing rate, heart rate, and
SpO2. No spectral differences were found to be correlated to the effect of hyperoxia on any of
these measures. All relevant interactions between observed spectral differences and the
counterbalancing order are described below.
Power Analyses
Across all electrodes, a large decrease in power was observed in the alpha band in the
eyes-opened condition compared to the eyes-closed condition (Figure 3A). In the eyes-opened
condition, hyperoxia was associated with decreases in power in the alpha (7.95 – 9.66 Hz) and
beta (17.38 – 21.98 Hz) frequency ranges, as shown in the electrode by frequency heatmap plot
in Figure 3B. Test statistics whose probability is below the 0.05 alpha level are emphasized in
darker colours. The decrease in alpha power was focused around fronto-central electrode sites
(electrode F3: Mhyp = 5.8215, Mnorm = 5.8542; Mdiff = 0.0328, SDdiff = 0.0748; t(25) = -2.23, p =
0.035). A two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA of alpha power with counterbalancing order
and gas condition as factors found a main effect of hyperoxia on alpha power (F(1,12) = 7.38, p
= 0.019), as well as an interaction between the effect of hyperoxia and the counterbalancing
order (F(1,12) = 13.84, p < 0.01) although there was no main effect of counterbalancing order
(F(1,12) = 0.099, n.s.). The decrease in beta power was focused around left-frontal sites.
(electrode F3: Mhyp = 5.1584, Mnorm = 5.1900; Mdiff = 0.0316, SDdiff = 0.0684; t(25) = -2.36, p =
0.027). A two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA of beta power with gas and counterbalancing
order as factors found a main effect of hyperoxia on beta power (F(1,12) = 5.39, p = 0.039), as

well as an interaction between the effect of hyperoxia and the counterbalancing order (F(1,12) =
8.59, p = 0.013) although there was no main effect of counterbalancing order (F(1,12) = 1.71,
n.s.). The difference spectra, hyperoxia – normoxia, shows the impact of hyperoxia on the
oscillations at electrode F3. The shaded lines represent the 95% CI for the difference.
Frequencies in the alpha and beta frequency ranges which reached significance at this level are
indicated in red on the x-axis (listed above; Figure 3D). In the eyes-closed condition, hyperoxia
was not associated with any reliable changes in power (Figure 3E).
Figure 3F shows the power in the eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions after the
average power within the entire oxygen block was subtracted out. It can be observed that within
the hyperoxia blocks, the difference in power between eyes-closed and eyes-opened was more
pronounced. We isolated the clusters of electrodes and frequencies which reliably showed this
interaction between the magnitude of the eyes-opened and eyes-closed difference and the oxygen
condition, revealing one band in the alpha range from 7.64 – 8.94 Hz, as shown in the electrode
by frequency heatmap in Figure 3G. This interaction was present in a large group of frontal
electrode sites. (electrode F3: MHypdiff = 0.2496, MNormdiff = 0.2032; SDhypdiff = 0.2305, SDnormdiff =
0.1983; F(1,25) = 6.1031, p = 0.021). A three-factor repeated-measures ANOVA of this alpha
activity with eye condition, gas condition, and counterbalancing order as factors found a main
effect of eye condition on alpha power (F(1,12) = 24.19, p < 0.001), as well as interactions
between the effect of hyperoxia and the counterbalancing order (F(1,12) = 9.95, p < 0.01) and
between hyperoxia, eye condition, and counterbalancing order (F(1,12) = 5.03, p = 0.044). The
interaction between hyperoxia and eye condition was trending in this case (F(1,12) = 3.91, p =
0.07). The two difference spectras, eyes-closed – eyes-opened, were plotted for both the
hyperoxia and normoxia conditions at electrode F3 (Figure 3I). Error bars represent the within-

subject SEM, removing the variance associated with differences between individuals (Loftus &
Mason, 1994). The frequencies in the alpha range for which the oxygen by eye interaction
reaches significance at the 0.05 alpha level are indicated in red on the x-axis (indicated above).
BOSC and Pepisode Analyses
Because spectral power reflects a smeared average across frequency bands and is not
necessarily a robust method for detecting oscillations per se (Caplan et al., 2001), we used the
Better OSCillation (BOSC) detection method which has been validated for state-dependent
alternations in alpha detections (Whitten et al, 2011). Across all electrodes, a large (~20%)
decrease in the number of detected alpha oscillations was observed in the eyes-opened condition
compared to the eyes-closed condition (Figure 4A), similar to the power results. We performed
the same statistical analysis to isolate clusters of frequencies and electrodes showing reliable
differences in Pepisode between the hyperoxia and normoxia conditions. In the eyes-opened
condition, hyperoxia was associated with decreases in Pepisode in the alpha (6.80 – 10.06 Hz), beta
(14.30 – 19.55 Hz), and gamma (21.14 – 35.16 Hz) frequency ranges, as shown in the electrode
by frequency heatmap plot in Figure 4B. Test statistics which are below the 0.05 alpha level are
emphasized in darker colours. The decrease in alpha power was again focused around frontal
electrode sites, and was significant in a larger number of sites than in the power analysis.
(electrode F3: Mhyp = 8.00, Mnorm = 9.62; Mdiff = 1.61, SDdiff = 2.78; t(25) = -2.74, p = 0.0067.
The decrease in beta power was focused around left-frontal sites. (electrode F3: Mhyp = 2.18,

gamma power was focused around a range of sites over the left-frontal, central, and posterior
regions (electrode Pz (Mhyp = 0.70, Mnorm = 1.00; Mdiff = 0.31, SDdiff = 0.60; t(25) = -2.60, p =

the alpha, beta, and gamma frequency ranges which reached significance at this level are
indicated in red on the x-axis (listed above; Figure 4D).
In the eyes-closed condition, hyperoxia was associated with increases in Pepisode in the
delta (1.73 – 2.10 Hz), and theta (4.25 – 4.60 Hz) frequency ranges, and with a decrease in the
beta (15.46 – 19.55 Hz) frequency ranges, in contrast to the lack of differences found in the
power analysis (Figure 4E). Test statistics whose probability were below the 0.05 alpha level are
emphasized in darker colours. The increase in detected delta oscillations was focused around
right-posterior electrode sites (electrode PO4: Mhyp = 0.76, Mnorm = 0.36; Mdiff = 0.40, SDdiff =
0.56; t(25) = 3.63, p = 0.0013). The increase in detected theta oscillations was focused around a

0.46; t(25) = 3.22, p = 0.0036). A two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA of these theta values

and gamma frequency ranges which reached significance at this level are indicated in red on the
x-axis (listed above; Figure 4G).
Figure 4H shows the Pepisode in the eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions when the
power threshold was estimated within an oxygen condition rather than across the whole
experimental session. In this case, the oscillation detection procedure does not seem to depend as
strongly as the power analysis on the choice of baseline. We isolated the clusters of electrodes
and frequencies which reliably showed an interaction between the magnitude of the eyes-opened
and eyes-closed difference and the oxygen condition, revealing one band in the alpha range (6.80
– 9.30 Hz), and one band in the gamma range (23.78 – 42.76 Hz), as shown Figure 4I. The
interaction in the alpha range was present across most of the scalp and especially in frontal and
central electrode sites (electrode F3: MHypdiff = 13.43, MNormdiff = 10.19; SDhypdiff = 12.83,
SDnormdiff = 11.33; F(1,25) = 10.58, p = 3.0ൈ10-5). A three-factor repeated-measures ANOVA of
the alpha values with factors of eye condition, gas condition, and counterbalancing order, found
a main effect of eye condition on alpha power (F(1,12) = 23.79, p < 0.001), as well as two
interactions between the eye condition and the effect of hyperoxia (F(1,12) = 6.24, p = 0.028),
and between the eye condition, effect of hyperoxia, and the counterbalancing order (F(1,12) =
7.78, p = 0.016). The interaction in the gamma range was present across a large group of
electrodes centered on left-central electrode sites (electrode FC1: MHypdiff = 0.026, MNormdiff = 0.42; SDhypdiff = 1.09, SDnormdiff = 1.47; F(1,25) = 5.50, p = 0.036). The two difference spectras,
eyes-closed – eyes-opened, were plotted for both the hyperoxia and normoxia conditions at

and gamma range for which the oxygen by eye interaction reaches significance at the 0.05 alpha
level are indicated in red on the x-axis.
Analyses of detected alpha epochs
For periods of detected oscillatory activity in our frequency bands of interest, we
computed the mean raw power to determine if there were any differences in the amplitude of the
signals as an effect of hyperoxia (Figure 5A). For five out of our six bands, although differences
had been observed in the number of detected oscillations, no change in detected power was
observed between hyperoxia and normoxia conditions. For the remaining band, however (21.14
– 35.16 Hz) in the eyes-opened condition, the decrease in detected oscillations was accompanied
by a decrease in detected power.
We also characterized the actual number of cycles in each detected alpha epoch to
determine if hyperoxia had any effect on epoch lengths. Figure 5B shows the histograms of the
pooled number of cycles from the alpha range frequencies shown in Figure 4I showing a
significant interaction between eye and oxygen condition. Only detected segments from
electrode F3 were included. For both hyperoxia and normoxia conditions, opening the eyes leads
to a larger proportion of short (3-6 cycle) oscillatory periods, while closing the eyes increases the
proportion of long (7-25 cycle) oscillatory periods. Figure 5C shows the empirical cumulative
distribution function (cdf) derived from the pooled number of cycles. This figure similarly shows
that closing the eyes leads to a cdf which is more shifted to the longer cycle lengths. This effect
is larger for hyperoxia than normoxia. The KS test revealed that the hyperoxia eyes-opened
condition was significantly “smaller” than the distribution for the normoxia condition (p =
3.08x10-7), whereas the hyperoxia eyes-closed condition was significantly “larger” than the
distribution for the hyperoxia eyes-opened condition (p = 1.17x10-7).

Discussion

Oxygen is used in many clinical settings and its popularity for recreational administration
is rising. Our aim was to evaluate possible attentional benefits of short term oxygen
administration through an eyes-closed and eyes-opened resting-state EEG task. Under short-term
hyperoxia, we observed changes in blood O2 saturation as well as in heart rate and, and no
reduction in breathing rate. In addition, in the brain, there were state-dependent decreases across
several high EEG frequency bands, including low alpha, high alpha, beta, and gamma, as well as
increases in low frequency bands including delta and theta. Finally, our results also demonstrate
interactions between the oxygen and eye-conditions, which suggests that the effects of oxygen on
cortical activity may be state-specific.
Our experiment measured SpO2, breathing rate, and heart rate. Breathing is often ignored
in studies that examine cognitive tasks under hyperoxia. Monitoring of breathing is useful to
elucidate whether changes in spontaneous brain activity are due to oxygen manipulations per se
or instead influenced by fluctuating CO2 levels, which can be affected by breathing.
Poikliocapnic hyperoxia results in an immediate decrease in minute ventilation in the first minute
of exposure followed by a sustained increased in minute ventilation above baseline breathing
(Marczak & Pokorski, 2004); this increase in minute ventilation results from an increase in both
breathing rate and tidal volume. Despite changes in minute ventilation, changes in alveolar CO2
across hyperoxia exposure do not differ when compared to the same duration of exposure to
room air. Since we observed increases in SpO2, but little change in breathing rate between the
oxygen conditions, the changes in brain activity observed is more likely due to oxygen
manipulation rather than change in central CO2. It should be noted, however, that we cannot rule
out an effect of central CO2 and/or changes in cerebral blood flow as contributors to our findings

although a recent MRI experiment found no evidence that short-term hyperoxia causes such
changes (Croal et al., 2015) and a variety of sleep studies using PET have shown evidence of
uncoupling of cerebral blood flow and EEG measures of brain state (Bangash et al. 2008; Braun
et al. 1997; Hajak et al. 1994; Hofle et al. 1997).. Our finding of decreased heart rate with
oxygen administration is consistent with the literature and suggests that oxygen influences the
parasympathetic nervous system (Shibata, Iwasaki, Ogawa, Kato, & Ogawa, 2005; Waring et al.,
2013). The reduction in parasympathetic activity is potentially mediated by a reduced input from
peripheral chemoreceptors to the medulla oblongata (Lahiri, Mokashi, Mulligan, & Nishino,
1981).
One last consideration on the physiological variables is the question of whether it can be
assumed that oxygenation of the blood as evidenced in the difference in SpO2 levels (Figure 2A)
translates to oxygenation of neural tissue. Croal et al., (2015) used an isocapnic hyperoxic
stimulus to measure the effect of hyperoxia on MEG activation, and found that hyperoxia
produced decreases in alpha and beta signalling similar to those reported in our study, but lesser
in extent that those produced with pure hypercarbia.. In order to fully elucidate what exactly in
the brain causes the reduction in high-frequency oscillations which we have reported here, it
would be necessary to not only measure end-tidal O2 and CO2 to monitor changes in alveolar gas
exchange, but also to have a measure of the relative oxygenation in the brain before and after
hyperoxia.
Based on the known associations of alpha with visual and visuo-spatial attention (Thut et
al., 2006; Klimesch, Sauseng, & Hansylmayr, 2007; Jensen & Mazaheri, 2010; Mathewson et al.,
2011; Kizuk & Mathewson, 2017), we would hypothesize that fewer alpha detections and lower
power during eyes-opened conditions with hyperoxia would produce a beneficial effect for these

processes. Similar to the functional role of alpha in visual and other sensory modalities, a
suppression of beta activity is often associated with the role of sensory gating in the
somatosensory system and anticipatory selective attention (Neuper, Wörtz, & Pfurtscheller,
2006; Pomper, 2015). Our finding of a robust difference in beta activity between normoxia and
hyperoxia when the eyes were open but less so when the eyes were closed could suggest that the
impact of oxygen affects beta during alert, attentional states, and has little effect with a
disengaged state with the eyes-closed. This decrease in alpha and beta activity under hyperoxia
during alert states lends credence to reports of noticeable attentional changes when using
recreational oxygen, given the growing literature on beta activity and cognitive functioning.
Engel and Fries (2010) propose that a functional role of beta activity is the maintenance of the
current cognitive state of the participant. Under this framework, the decreases in the observed
beta activity under hyperoxia could reflect increased cognitive control and attentional flexibility,
which users of recreational oxygen interpret as improving their attention. Perhaps paradoxically,
although supported by previous studies which likely recorded under eyes-closed conditions (Seo
et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2014), hyperoxia appeared to enhance delta and theta activities while
decreasing gamma, a result that would likely indicate promotion of the initial stages (i.e., N1) of
sleep (Borbély & Tobler, 2011; Greene & Frank, 2010).
The eyes-closed and eyes-opened resting-state EEG task allowed us to compare within
and across different attentional states. As expected, opening and closing the eyes produced clear
differences in both the power and the Pepisode (frequency of detection) of alpha oscillations. When
the eyes were open, the detections of alpha, beta, and gamma bandwidth oscillations decreased
when hyperoxia was administered, whereas when the eyes were closed, the detections of delta
and theta bandwidth oscillations increased with hyperoxia, along with a decrease in gamma

detections. Hyperoxia was associated with a more notable decrease in alpha power and both
alpha and gamma detections when the eyes were opened compared to when they were closed. In
addition, we observed that hyperoxia contributes to the magnitude of the transition between eyesopened (engaged) and eyes-closed (disengaged) oscillatory states. There was a significant
interaction between oxygen and eye effects such there was a significantly larger transition during
hyperoxia in both the power and detection of alpha oscillations across the eyes closed/opened
condition than during normoxia. Indeed, when we computed the average number of contiguous
cycles of alpha using BOSC, we observed that not only did closing the eyes produce longer
bursts of alpha activity, but that hyperoxia was associated with a more exaggerated transition
across the behavioural condition.
While different oscillatory states are associated with specific cognitive functions, our task
did not specifically test a cognitive function, rather it simply demonstrated that there are
oscillatory changes that occur under short-term hyperoxia in resting state conditions. Sheng et al.
(2017) recently demonstrated that hyperoxia was associated with reductions in alpha and beta
power during both a sustained attention task and a visual ERP task. Our results similarly showed
that hyperoxia was associated with decreases in alpha and beta power as well as proportion of
detections during a resting state task when the eyes were opened but extended this to the
comparison of eyes-closed condition in which this decrease was lessened.
That said, there are other factors which may have influenced our findings. In particular,
the fronto-temporal localization of the beta and gamma decrease under hyperoxia suggests that
decreased scalp and eye muscular activity could be contributing in whole or in part to our results.
This lays the foundation for future research to explore the potential of transient administration of
oxygen on attentional tasks, to see if these changes in oscillatory dynamics correlate with

behavioural performance. Such studies should be careful to measure muscular contributions to
oscillation measures using EMG. Another limitation of our study was that our SpO2
measurement was not continuously assessed during the trials, but rather at the beginning and
ends of each block. Thus, we were only able to examine differences in SpO2 across different
blocks. Lastly, we were unable to assess whether participant entered into light stages of sleep
during the eyes-closed condition, which may have contributed to the enhancements seen in delta
and theta bands.
Many researchers have also investigated the effects of the opposite hypoxic manipulation
on ongoing brain active as measured by oscillations in electrical activity. For instance, sleep
apnea is a common example in which oxygen supply to the brain is reduced periodically and
EEG oscillations have been shown to change (e.g. Svanbog & Guilleminault, 1996). Hypoxic
manipulations require difficult lab setups including hyperbaric chambers, or can be done at
altitude. These studies have also shown consistent changes in resting and active oscillatory states
including decreases in alpha activity and increased slow wave sleep (Kraaier, Van Huffelen, &
Wieneke, 1988; Van der Worp et al., 1991; Ozaki, Watanabe, & Suzuki, 1995; Papadelis et al.,
2007). Further work is needed to compare hyperoxic and hypoxic manipulations in the same
participants and settings.
Another popular use of oxygen manipulation is in elite athletes. Many athletes train in
hypoxic environments like altitudes and some sleep in hypoxic chambers (Wilber, 2007).
Further, athletes travelling to high altitude environments often supplement during performance
with additional oxygen (Morris, Kearney, & Burke, 2000). The effect of these additional
bidirectional uses of oxygen on brain activity and subsequent cognitive performance in this elite
population should be further considered.

Conclusion
Here we manipulated oxygen administration in eyes-opened and eyes-closed resting
states while monitoring for respiration and other physiological responses like heart rate and
SpO2. Modest EEG changes were seen in both resting state conditions during hyperoxia that may
be associated with increased alertness during eyes-opened conditions and paradoxically perhaps,
the initiation of sleep states during eyes-closed conditions. In addition, we found that oxygen
enhanced the changes typically seen when comparing eyes-opened to eyes-closed conditions,
especially in the alpha band. Our results demonstrate that in comparable conditions to that
provided by recreational oxygen providers, the administration of hyperoxic gas could potentially
have the attentional benefits specified during eyes-opened wakefulness and may also
differentially promote relaxation and sleep during eyes-closed conditions. Future studies are
needed to evaluate the precise impact that hyperoxia actually on neural oxygenation, and to
further evaluate the effects of oxygen on attentional processing, behavioural performance, and
behavioural state.

Figure 1. Experimental procedure. Participants completed four 3-minute trials, two eyes-opened
and two eyes-closed, within each gas block. Participants completed four gas blocks in total,
two hyperoxia and two normoxia conditions, interleaved. Block order was counterbalanced
across subjects.
Figure 2: Physiological measurements. A) SpO2 measurements for the baseline period and for
the average of the two measurements at the beginning and end of each gas block. B)
Breathing rate differences between hyperoxia and normoxia conditions. No significant
within-subjects difference was observed. Dark line is grand average; error bars are withinsubject SEM. C) Heart rate differences between hyperoxia and normoxia conditions. Heart
rate was significantly lower in the hyperoxia condition for both eyes-opened (p < 0.001)
and eyes-closed (p < 0.01) conditions.
Figure 3: Analysis of power changes across electrodes, frequencies, state, and oxygen
conditions. A) The raw power spectra of each condition averaged across all electrodes.
Shaded lines represent the within-subject SEM. B) The t-statistic for the difference due to
hyperoxia on eyes-opened power is plotted at each electrode and frequency. Comparisons
which were statistically significant at the 0.05 α level are emphasized. C) Topographical
distributions of the statistical effects, as well as the magnitude of power in each condition
is plotted at electrode F3 for each band. Error bars represent the within-subject SEM. D)
The difference spectrum of hyperoxia – normoxia power for the eyes-opened condition,
from electrode F3. The shaded line plots the 95% CI for the difference. E) The t-statistic
for the difference due to hyperoxia on eyes-closed power is plotted at every electrode and
frequency, showing no clusters of significant differences. F) Power spectra for each
condition after subtracting the overall average power across conditions, accentuating the

differences due to gas. G) The F statistic for the interaction between gas condition and eye
condition is plotted at every electrode and frequency. Comparisons which were statistically
significant at the 0.05 α level are emphasized. H) The topographical distribution of the

oxygen conditions. A) The Pepisode spectra across all electrodes, thresholded with the
average power spectrum across the whole experiment. Error bars represent the withinsubject SEM. B) The t-statistic for the difference due to hyperoxia on eyes-opened Pepisode
is plotted at each electrode and frequency. Comparisons which were statistically significant
at the 0.05 α level are emphasized. C) The topographical distributions of the statistical
effect, as well as the percentage of time oscillations were detected in each condition at
electrode F3 is plotted for each band. Error bars represent the within-subject SEM. D) The
difference spectrum of hyperoxia – normoxia Pepisode during the eyes-opened condition,
from electrode F3. The shaded error plot represents the 95% CI for the difference. E) The
t-statistic for the difference due to hyperoxia on eyes-closed Pepisode is plotted at each
electrode and frequency. Comparisons which were statistically significant at the 0.05 α
level are emphasized. F) The topographical distributions of the statistical effect, as well as

show the observed increase in the delta band. The error bar represents the 95% CI for the
difference. H) The Pepisode spectra thresholded with the averaged power within each gas
condition, rather than across all gas conditions showing that the choice of background
spectra did not influence the detection of oscillations of different frequencies. I) The F
statistic for the interaction between gas condition and eye condition is plotted at every
electrode and frequency. Comparisons which were statistically significant at the 0.05 α
level are emphasized. J) The topographical distribution of the statistical effect in this band
as well as the percentage of time oscillations were detected at electrode F3 are plotted for
each condition. Error bars represent the within-subject SEM. K) The difference spectra for
eyes-closed – eyes-opened Pepisode across the hyperoxia and normoxia conditions, for
electrode F3, showing a larger difference in the hyperoxia condition. Error bars represent
the within-subject SEM.
Figure 5: Analysis of detected alpha epoch lengths. A) Bar graphs showing the raw power values
within detected segments only (detected power) for the six frequency ranges which showed
main effects of gas on detected oscillations. Only the beta frequency range of 21.14 –
35.16 Hz in the eyes-opened condition shows a decrease in power within detected
segments. Error bars are within-subject SEM. B) Distributions for the number of cycles
detected from the range of 6.8 : 9.3 Hz. Closing the eyes results in longer number of
cycles, for both normoxia and hyperoxia conditions. C) Empirical cumulative distribution
function estimated from the pooled number of cycles distributions across subjects.
Hyperoxia cdfs were significantly more extreme than normoxia cdfs.
