ABSTRACT
7

An animal’s motion through the environment can induce large and frequent fluc-

8

tuations in light intensity on the retina. These fluctuations pose a major challenge

9

to neural circuits tasked with encoding visual information, as they can cause cells to

10

adapt and lose sensitivity. Here, we report that sensitization, a short-term plasticity

11

mechanism, solves this difficult computational problem by maintaining neuronal sen-

12

sitivity in the face of these fluctuations. The numerically dominant output pathway

13

in the macaque monkey retina, the midget (parvocellular-projecting) pathway, under-

14

goes sensitization under specific conditions, including simulated eye movements. Sen-

15

sitization is present in the excitatory synaptic inputs from midget bipolar cells and is

16

mediated by presynaptic disinhibition from wide-field amacrine cells. Direct physio-

17

logical recordings and a computational model indicate that sensitization in the midget

18

pathway supports accurate sensory encoding and prevents a loss of responsiveness

19

during dynamic visual processing.

INTRODUCTION
20

The fundamental constraints on sensory coding require that neural circuits adjust

21

their outputs based on the statistical properties of their recent inputs (Srinivasan et

22

al., 1982; Barlow, 1961; Laughlin, 1981). Neurons respond to dynamic inputs using

23

two distinct strategies—adaptation and sensitization. Adapting cells respond to strong

24

stimulation by decreasing their sensitivity and this decrease in responsiveness can

25

persist for several seconds after the stimulus intensity decreases (Baccus and Meister,

26

2002; Carandini and Ferster, 1997; Kim and Rieke, 2001; Laughlin, 1981; Manookin

27

and Demb, 2006; Smirnakis et al., 1997; Solomon et al., 2004). Thus, adapting cells are

28

relatively insensitive to weak stimuli occurring during these transition periods. Sensi-

29

tizing cells show the opposite pattern—increasing their responsiveness at these transi-

30

tions (Kastner and Baccus, 2011; Kastner and Baccus, 2013; Nikolaev et al., 2013). For

31

this reason, adaptation and sensitization are commonly thought to constitute opposing

32

and complementary forms of short-term neural plasticity (Kastner and Baccus, 2011;

33

Kastner and Baccus, 2013).

34

This hypothesis requires that a sensitizing cell type have an adapting counterpart that

35

encodes common information (Kastner and Baccus, 2011). However, this constraint

36

could potentially decrease the amount of information that can be encoded in an neu-

37

ral ensemble and increase the metabolic demands on a sensory tissue (Laughlin, 1981;

38

Balasubramanian et al., 2001). Alternatively, adaptation and sensitization could be sig-

39

natures of fundamentally distinct neural coding strategies (Młynarski and Hermund-

40

stad, 2018). Further, these alternative hypotheses are not mutually exclusive—adapting

41

and sensitizing cells could mirror each other in some species and neural pathways and

42

not in others, depending on the particular coding and metabolic constraints in those

43

systems (Laughlin, 1981; Barlow, 1961; Levy and Baxter, 1996; Balasubramanian et al.,

44

2001). However, given that neural sensitization was only recently discovered, relatively

45

little is known about its roles in neural information processing.

46

To address this issue, we recorded from five types of output neurons in the macaque

47

monkey retina—broad thorny, On and Off parasol (magnocellular-projecting), and

48

On and Off midget (parvocellular-projecting) ganglion cells. These cells have well de-

49

scribed roles in visual processing and no known functional counterparts. We studied

50

how these cells responded to global fluctuations in contrast and other stimulus statis-

51

tics. We report that whereas broad thorny and parasol cells strongly adapted, midget

52

cells sensitized—increasing their responsiveness to certain types of visual stimulation,

53

including high contrast and simulated eye movements. Synaptic current recordings re-

54

vealed that this increased sensitivity was present in the excitatory input from midget

55

bipolar cells and was mediated by presynaptic disinhibition. A computational model

56

based on synaptic input recordings further indicated that this increase in sensitivity

57

greatly enhanced the fidelity of encoding natural scenes. Moreover, the lack of an

58

adapting counterpart to midget cells indicates that sensitizing circuits perform a dis-

59

tinct role in primate retina relative to that observed in other vertebrate neural sys-

60

tems (Kastner and Baccus, 2011; Kastner and Baccus, 2013; Nikolaev et al., 2013; Cohen-

61

Kashi Malina et al., 2013).

RESULTS
62

The midget pathway of the primate retina is commonly believed to lack short-term

63

plasticity mechanisms such as contrast gain control. This belief is based on reports that

64

midget cells did not exhibit noticeable changes in responsiveness following transitions

65

from high to low contrast regimes (Solomon et al., 2004; Benardete et al., 1992). The

66

assay used to measure adaptation was a sinusoidally modulated drifting grating with

67

bar widths tuned to the size of the midget cell receptive field center, which is narrower

68

than many other retinal cell types. Thus, if plasticity in the midget pathway depended

69

on mechanisms with broader spatial tuning, this assay would not engage such mecha-

70

nisms.

71

To determine whether short-term plasticity in the midget pathway depended on

72

the spatial properties of the stimulus, we repeated this assay while varying the spa-

73

tial tuning of the gratings. At the offset of high contrast, midget cells did not exhibit

74

a notable change in firing relative to the period that preceded high-contrast stimula-

75

tion (Solomon et al., 2004; Benardete et al., 1992) (Figure 1C; spatial frequency, 3.5

76

cycles degree–1 ). To determine whether this lack of either adaptation or sensitiza-

77

tion persisted across a range of stimulus conditions, we varied the spatial frequency

78

content of the drifting gratings. Following the offset of low spatial frequency grat-

79

ings, most midget cells showed an increase in spiking relative to the period preced-

80

ing grating onset (Figure 1D; spatial frequency, 0.35 cycles degree–1 ). This increase

81

in spiking following high contrast is characteristic of the contrast sensitization ob-

82

served in other vertebrate retinas (Kastner and Baccus, 2011; Kastner and Baccus, 2013;

83

Nikolaev et al., 2013). The presence of sensitization at low spatial frequencies suggested

84

that sensitization depended on the ability to engage elements in the midget cell recep-

tive field with broad spatial tuning relative to the midget bipolar cell.
Parasol and broad thorny cells responded very differently than midgets. At the tran-

87

sition from high to low contrast, these cells showed a pronounced decrease in spiking

88

relative to the period before the grating turned on and several seconds were required

89

for the spike rate to recover (Figure 1A, B; high contrast, 1.0; low contrast, 0.0; spatial

90

frequency, 0.18-3.5 cycles degree–1 ; grating size, 730 µm × 730 µm). This behavior is

91

characteristic of contrast adaptation—during periods of high contrast, circuit mecha-

92

nisms reduce the gain to avoid saturation and the gain remains low for several seconds

93

following the transition to a low-contrast regime (Chander and Chichilnisky, 2001;

Benardete and Kaplan, 1999; Solomon et al., 2004).

95

Wide-ﬁeld stimulation evokes contrast sensitization in midget ganglion cells

96

Our next goal was to determine how this putative wide-field component of the midget

97

cell receptive field contributed to contrast coding. To accomplish this goal, we sought a

98

more spatially and temporally precise assay of sensitivity following wide-field adapta-

99

tion. Contrast tuning of parasol and midget cells was determined with spots centered

100

on the receptive field (duration, 0.1 s; parasol diameter, 80-200 µm; midget diameter,

101

40-80 µm). Contrast responses were measured in isolation (unadapted condition) or

102

50-100 ms following the offset of an adapting stimulus (adapted condition). The adapt-

103

ing stimulus was a large, high-contrast spot modulated at 20-30 Hz (diameter, 730 µm;

104

contrast, 0.5-1.0, duration, 1.25 s). Presentations of the adapted and unadapted stimuli

105

were interleaved to account for any potential variability in cellular responses over time.

106

Example spike responses to this stimulus paradigm are shown in Figure 2. Parasol

107

cells increased their spike rate at the onset of the adapting stimulus and the spike rate

108

quickly decreased to a steady-state rate by ~0.25 s. Test flashes presented after the offset

109

of the adapting stimulus evoked fewer spikes relative to the unadapted control (Figure

110

2A). Both of these patterns—a transient increase in spike rate following the transition to

111

high contrast and a decrease in spiking after the transition to low contrast—are char-

112

acteristic of cells undergoing contrast adaptation (Kim and Rieke, 2001; Baccus and

113

Meister, 2002; Brown and Masland, 2001).

114

We modeled the variation in the contrast-response function following the adapting

115

stimulus as a change in the slope (gain) and a horizontal shift relative to the control

116

condition (see Methods). Following the adapting stimulus, parasol cells showed a large

117

decrease in gain (–30.2 ± 4.5%; n = 5 cells; p = 1.3 × 10–3 ; Wilcoxon signed rank test,

118

here and below) and a small rightward horizontal shift (+3.6 ± 1.5% contrast; p = 3.0 ×

119

10–2 ) relative to the unadapted control (Figure 2C). This result confirms previous re-

120

ports that parasol cells readily adapt to contrast by continuously adjusting their sensi-

121

tivity to match the statistics of incoming visual inputs (Chander and Chichilnisky, 2001;

122

Solomon et al., 2004; Benardete et al., 1992).

123

Midget cells showed several striking differences relative to the pattern observed in

124

parasol cells. First, the decrease in gain was much smaller in midget cells (–5.4 ± 4.3%;

125

n = 14 cells; p = 0.12). Second, an increase in spike rate was observed at the offset

126

of the adapting stimulus relative to the unadapted control (Figure 2B). This increase

127

in spiking was evident at all contrasts tested including the zero-contrast condition in

128

which the spot intensity was equal to the average background intensity. The elevation

129

in spiking following the adapting stimulus produced a leftward shift in the contrast-

130

response curve relative to control (–16.2 ± 2.3% contrast; p = 5.2 × 10–6 ). A negative

131

horizontal shift value occurred when the adapted curve was shifted to the left of the

132

control curve and this indicated that a weaker stimulus was required to elicit the same

133

spike response from a midget cell following the adapting stimulus. This observation

134

was consistent with previous reports demonstrating that a decreased spike threshold,

135

increased baseline response, and slight decrease in gain are characteristic of contrast

136

sensitization (Kastner and Baccus, 2011; Kastner and Baccus, 2013).

137

Contrast sensitization is reduced for wide-ﬁeld stimulation

138

Midget cells show narrow receptive-field centers with strong input from the receptive-

139

field surround (Crook et al., 2011; De Monasterio and Gouras, 1975; Derrington et al.,

140

1984). Thus, the effect of sensitization may be diminished following the adapting stim-

141

ulus depending on the relative influences of the direct midget bipolar cell input and

142

wide-field mechanisms in contrast sensitization. To determine whether contrast sen-

143

sitization varied with the size of the test flash, we repeated the adaptation experiment

144

but used wide-field test flashes to measure the contrast tuning of midget cells (diam-

145

eter, 730 µm). The wide-field test flash evoked a slight leftward shift for the adapted

146

condition relative to control, but this shift was much smaller than was observed for the

147

small-diameter test flash in the same cell (compare Figure 2B, D). This trend held true

148

across midget cells—horizontal shifts were more negative for the small-diameter test

149

flash than for the wide-field test flash in the same cell and these shifts were not statis-

150

tically significant for the wide-field test flashes (x-shift, –2.4 ± 4.6% contrast; p = 0.30;

151

gain change, –5.8 ± 5.8%; n = 9 cells; p = 0.17; Figure 2E). These data indicated that the

152

relative activations of narrow-field and wide-field mechanisms during and following

153

the adapting stimulus were critical to contrast sensitization in midget ganglion cells.

154

Moreover, this result agrees well with previous findings that did not report contrast

155

sensitization to wide-field noise (Chander and Chichilnisky, 2001).

156

Time course for the onset and persistence of sensitization

157

We next sought to determine the amount of stimulation needed to evoke sensitiza-

ulation period needed to initiate sensitization, we varied the presentation time of the

160

adapting stimulus and measured the change in spike rate relative to the unadapted con-

161

trol (adaptation duration, 0.25-1.25 s; contrast, ±0.5; duration, 0.1 s). For each period

162

of adaptation, midget cells showed an elevation in spiking relative to unadapted con-

163

trols (Figure 3A). Thus, sensitization could be elicited even with fairly brief stimulus

164

presentations.

165

To determine the time course of sensitization in midget cells, we measured spot re-

166

sponses at different times following the offset of the adapting stimulus (delay, 0.025-1.6

167

sec; contrast, ±0.5; duration, 0.1 sec). Relative to the unadapted control, the adapting

168

stimulus elicited higher spike rates to the test flash in midget cells at delays of 0.025-

169

0.4 seconds (Figure 3B). This elevation in spiking, characteristic of sensitization, was

170

greatest 0.05-0.1 seconds after the offset of the adapting stimulus. Parasol cells, on the

171

other hand, showed a reduction in spiking to the same stimulus that persisted for ap-

172

proximately one second (Figure 3C). Together, these data indicated that sensitization

173

in midget cells could be elicited even with fairly brief stimulus presentations and that

it persisted for several hundred milliseconds.

wavelength cones (M cones) to the receptive-field center and surround (Crook et al.,

179

2011; De Monasterio and Gouras, 1975; Derrington et al., 1984). To determine whether

180

sensitization affected chromatic processing, we measured contrast responses in midget

181

cells with purely chromatic (isoluminant) test flashes following the adapting stimulus.

182

Isoluminant (equiluminant) stimuli are commonly employed to study color mecha-

183

nisms in isolation. These stimuli are created by modulating L and M cones in oppos-

184

ing phases to silence achromatic mechanisms that sum inputs from these cone types

185

(i.e., L+M). We measured contrast-responses to purely chromatic (isoluminant) flashes

186

(duration, 0.1 sec) in the presence or absence of an achromatic adapting stimulus, as

187

above. As with the achromatic stimuli, the adapting stimulus elicited a leftward shift

188

to chromatic test contrasts (Figure 4). This shift was reminiscent of that observed for

189

achromatic stimulation (–11.3 ± 4.1% contrast; n = 8 cells; p = 1.5 × 10–2 ). These data indi-

190

cated that contrast sensitization enhanced both achromatic and chromatic processing

191

in midget cells.

192

While chromatic processing was affected by sensitization, the observation that an

193

achromatic adapting stimulus was sufficient to evoke sensitization indicated that chro-

194

matic circuits were not necessary to elicit the phenomenon. These data did not, how-

195

ever, rule out contributions from purely chromatic mechanisms to contrast sensitiza-

196

tion.

197

Sensitization does not arise from a chromatic mechanism

198

To determine whether such a chromatic mechanism contributed to the observed

199

contrast sensitization, we presented a chromatic adapting stimulus. This stimulus was

200

specifically designed to modulate chromatic mechanisms that differentiate L- and M-

201

cone inputs (L–M; isoluminant) while silencing achromatic mechanisms that sum in-

202

puts from the L- and M-cone pathways (L+M; isochromatic). Following the adapting

203

stimulus, an isoluminant contrast series was used to measure the input-output rela-

204

tionship. In the same cell, we compared chromatic contrast-responses following a

205

chromatic (L–M) or achromatic (L+M) adapting stimulus.

206

The achromatic adapting stimulus produced a leftward shift in the chromatic contrast-

207

response relation. The chromatic adapting stimulus, however, produced no such shift

208

(x-shift, –1.1 ± 4.7% contrast; n = 8 cells; p = 0.41). We interpreted this result as evidence

209

that contrast sensitization arose from an achromatic mechanism in the midget cell

receptive-field. Moreover, given the role of horizontal cells in forming the L-versus-M

Sensitization is present in excitatory synaptic input from midget bipolar cells
The experiments above found contrast sensitization in the spike output of midget

215

ganglion cells. Our next goal was to understand the circuit mechanisms mediating sen-

216

sitization. To accomplish this goal, we measured the direct excitatory and inhibitory

217

synaptic inputs to midget ganglion cells with whole-cell, voltage-clamp recordings (see

218

Methods). Excitatory currents were isolated by holding a cell’s membrane voltage at

219

the reversal potential for inhibition (–70 mV), and likewise, inhibitory currents were

220

recorded at the excitatory reversal potential (0 mV). An increase in excitatory input to

221

a cell was indicated by a more negative (inward) current relative to the leak current. In-

222

deed, the adapting stimulus evoked larger inward excitatory currents relative to the un-

223

adapted control at all contrasts tested (Figure 5A). Plotting excitatory charge as a func-

224

tion of contrast revealed a similar pattern to that observed in the spike recordings—the

225

adapting stimulus evoked a leftward shift in the contrast-response curve relative to the

226

unadapted control (Figure 5B). On average, the adapting stimulus elicited a horizontal

227

shift of –11% contrast (–11.3 ± 4.2% contrast; n = 8 cells; p = 1.95 × 10–2 ). These results

228

indicated that contrast sensitization was present in the excitatory synaptic input from

229

midget bipolar cells to midget ganglion cells.

230

We also tested for the presence of sensitization in the inhibitory synaptic inputs

231

to midget cells. Unlike the pattern observed in spiking and excitatory currents, the

232

adapting stimulus did not consistently elicit leftward shifts in the inhibitory contrast-

233

response functions relative to control (+5.8 ± 4.3% contrast; n = 8 cells; p = 0.25; Figure

234

5C). These data indicated that contrast sensitization arose at or prior to the level of

235

glutamate release from midget bipolar cells. This finding was consistent with the cir-

236

cuit model for contrast sensitization in bipolar cells in the retinas of fish, salamander,

237

mice, and rabbits (Kastner and Baccus, 2013; Kastner and Baccus, 2011; Nikolaev et

238

al., 2013). This model posited a mechanism in which a strongly adapting amacrine

239

cell drove sensitization by a mechanism of presynaptic inhibition at the bipolar cell

240

terminal (Kastner and Baccus, 2013). During the adapting stimulus, the amacrine cell

241

adapted such that it decreased release of inhibitory neurotransmitter to the bipolar cell

242

synaptic terminal relative to the tonic level following stimulus offset. This presynap-

243

tic disinhibition, in turn, depolarized the bipolar cell synaptic terminal, allowing the

244

cell to utilize its full dynamic range in signaling via glutamate release to postsynaptic

245

ganglion cells.

246

Cleanly measuring the effects of presynaptic inhibition on circuit function has proven

247

exceedingly difficult as use of inhibitory receptor antagonists typically cause many off-

248

target effects that make data interpretation highly tenuous (Cook et al., 1998). Indeed,

249

adding inhibitory antagonists in primate retina evoked significant increases in tonic

250

glutamate release from bipolar cells and changed the contrast polarity of On parasol

251

cells (Manookin et al., 2018). Nonetheless, our spike and whole-cell recordings strongly

252

supported the proposed model in which contrast sensitization arose from disinhibi-

tion at the presynaptic bipolar cell terminal (Kastner and Baccus, 2013). First, the lack

254

of sensitization to a purely chromatic (isoluminant) adapting stimulus indicated that

255

sensitization did not arise in the outer retina at the level of horizontal cell feedback

256

(Figure 4). Second, the effect of presynaptic disinhibition was seen in our excitatory

current recordings (Figure 5D). In one of our stimulus conditions the test flash contrast

was zero such that the stimulus intensity returned to the average background intensity

260

trast following the adapting stimulus, we observed an increase in excitatory synaptic

261

input (Figure 5D). This response pattern was consistent with a decrease in presynap-

262

tic inhibition following the offset of the adapting stimulus, resulting in an increase in

263

glutamate release from midget bipolar cells. Thus, our recordings in midget pathway

264

of primate retina were consistent with the circuit motif proposed in other vertebrate

265

species (Figure 5E; (Kastner and Baccus, 2013)).

266

A contrast sensitization model reproduces midget cell responses

267

Having established the presence of contrast sensitization in midget bipolar cells, we

268

next sought to understand the relevance of this neural computation to visual process-

269

ing in primates. To accomplish this goal, we developed a computational model of the

270

proposed circuit in which bipolar cell glutamate release was modulated through presy-

271

naptic amacrine cell inhibition (Kastner and Baccus, 2013; Kastner and Baccus, 2011;

272

Nikolaev et al., 2013). Model parameters were determined by recording excitatory and

273

inhibitory synaptic current responses from midget ganglion cells to a Gaussian white

274

noise stimulus (see Methods).

275

We modeled the midget bipolar and presynaptic amacrine cell pathways using the

276

classical linear-nonlinear model with two modifications: 1) adaptation occurred at the

277

amacrine cell output and 2) the amacrine cell output was applied to the bipolar cell

278

model prior to the bipolar cell output nonlinearity (Figure 6A). The model parameters

279

controlling presynaptic sensitization were fit from direct excitatory current recordings.

280

In the same cell from which these parameters were determined, we measured excita-

281

tory current responses to the wide-field adapting stimulus (see Figure 5), and the model

282

qualitatively reproduced the increase in excitatory currents following the offset of this

283

adapting stimulus (Figure 6C).

284

We further tested the model using the drifting grating stimuli presented in Figure

285

1. The model produced distinct outputs for the high and low spatial frequency grat-

286

ings. The high frequency grating produced a relatively small response and, as a result,

287

little adaptation in the presynaptic amacrine cell (Figure 6D, middle row). This was

288

due to the broad receptive field center size of the amacrine cell relative to the bars of

289

the grating. Low frequency gratings, however, strongly modulated the amacrine cell

290

and produced significant adaptation; this adaptation, in turn, caused a removal of in-

291

hibition at the level of the bipolar cell following the offset of the grating, resulting in

292

sensitization (Figure 6D, bottom row). The model predictions were qualitatively simi-

298

We next sought to understand how these differing strategies of adaptation and sen-

sitization impacted encoding during naturalistic vision. This was done by testing the

300

ability of adapting and sensitizing models to accurately encode natural scenes. We

301

specifically wanted to determine how accurately downstream visual circuits could re-

construct naturalistic input stimuli based on the outputs of populations of model On

304

from the DOVES database—a dataset of eye movements in humans recorded while

305

observing natural images (Van Der Linde et al., 2009). Reconstruction accuracy was

306

determined by calculating the correlation between the stimulus and response of each

307

model (see Methods). Periods of fixation between ballistic eye movements are criti-

308

cally important to visual coding in primates; thus, model performance was separately

309

calculated for the complete movie or for periods of fixation only.

310

We considered two different decoding models for estimating the stimulus contrast

311

based on the outputs of On and Off midget ganglion cells. The first model utilized a

312

linear decoding scheme in which stimulus contrast was estimated by taking the scaled

313

difference between the On and Off cell outputs. We also tested a quadratic decoding

314

model that squared the On and Off outputs prior to differencing (see Methods). Us-

315

ing these decoders, we compared the performance of the sensitization model with a

316

model in which the midget bipolar underwent contrast adaptation. Regardless of the

317

decoding scheme used, the sensitizing model showed higher accuracy for reconstruct-

318

ing the entire stimulus trajectory than the adapting model (linear r 2 : sensitization, 0.81

319

± 0.05; adaptation, 0.23 ± 0.07; p = 2.7 × 10–54 ; quadratic r 2 : sensitization, 0.84 ± 0.05;

320

adaptation, 0.45 ± 0.09; p = 2.9 × 10–54 ; n = 161 movies; mean ± SD; Figure 7C). The sen-

321

sitizing model also outperformed the adapting model when the analysis was restricted

322

to periods of fixation (Figure 7D).

323

The sensitizing model showed increased encoding accuracy for periods of fixation

324

relative to periods of ballistic eye movements (movement r 2 , 0.63 ± 0.12; p = 2.9 × 10–35 ;

325

Figure 7E). This finding suggested that sensitization could play a particularly important

326

role in vision during periods of fixation following the offset of global motion. We, thus,

327

sought to determine whether background motion could evoke contrast sensitization

328

with direct recordings from midget ganglion cells.

329

Background motion evokes contrast sensitization in midget cells

330

To determine whether background motion elicited sensitization, we measured con-

331

trast responses in midget cells following the offset of a full-field moving texture (speed,

332

5-11 degrees s–1 ; duration, 1 s). The goal was to simulate, as closely as possible, the brief

333

periods of fixation following eye movements and to test sensitivity during these fix-

334

ation periods. We interleaved these recordings with measurements when the texture

335

was stationary throughout the trial. The moving textures elicited an increase in spiking

336

and a leftward shift in the contrast-response functions relative to the control condition

These data were consistent with our circuit model of contrast sensitization. The

341

amacrine cell providing presynaptic inhibition to the midget bipolar cell adapted dur-

342

ing background motion; at the offset of motion, the cell hyperpolarized and reduced

343

presynaptic inhibition to the bipolar terminal. Thus, similar to circuits described in

344

other vertebrates, the midget pathway could utilize presynaptic inhibition to account

345

for self-motion (Olveczky et al., 2003; Baccus et al., 2008; Kastner and Baccus, 2013).

DISCUSSION
346

Our results support a novel role for neural sensitization in primates relative to the

347

function proposed in other species. Sensitizing cells are commonly thought to coun-

348

teract the loss of responsiveness experienced by adapting cells during transitions from

349

high to low variance environments (Kastner and Baccus, 2011). This hypothesis re-

350

quires that sensitizing cells have an adapting counterpart that encodes similar infor-

351

mation about the environment. Midget (parvocellular-projecting) ganglion cells are

352

well known for their roles in both chromatic and achromatic vision (Crook et al., 2011;

353

De Monasterio and Gouras, 1975; Derrington et al., 1984). Functional parallelism in

354

the midget pathway is achieved by splitting signals between different classes of cone

355

photoreceptor (L versus M) or bipolar cell (On versus Off) inputs to the midget cell

356

receptive-field. Further, we found that both On- and Off-type midget cells exhibited

357

sensitization (Figure 1-4, 8), and the primate retina lacks an adapting functional coun-

358

terpart to midget cells with similar chromatic opponency or spatial acuity (Wässle,

359

2004); thus, sensitization does not counterbalance adaptation in another functionally

360

parallel pathway.

361

Instead, our findings indicate that sensitization maintains the responsiveness of the

362

midget pathway during dynamic visual processes, such as head or eye movements,

363

that cause rapid fluctuations in light intensity on the retina. We base this conclusion

364

on several key observations. First, sensitization was strongest following wide-field stim-

365

ulation (Figure 1-4) or background motion (Figure 8). Second, sensitization persisted

366

for >0.2 s (Figure 3), a period that roughly corresponds to the durations of fixations fol-

367

lowing eye movements in primates (reviewed in (Rayner, 1998)). Finally, sensitization

368

greatly improved the fidelity of encoding natural movies, particularly during periods

369

of fixation following ballistic eye motion (Figure 7). Thus, sensitization appears to play

370

a unique and crucial role in neural coding in primates.

371

A parallel study also found evidence supporting the link between the sensitization

372

mechanisms that we observed in midget ganglion cells and visual perception in hu-

373

mans (Naecker and Baccus, 2018). Subjects showed a significant enhancement in con-

374

trast sensitivity following the offset of wide-field motion; and this increase in sensitivity

375

was manifest as a leftward horizontal shift in the perceptual input-output relationship,

376

just as we observed in midget cells (compare Figure 2 in our study with Figure 5 of

377

(Naecker and Baccus, 2018)). Together, these findings provide a rare example of a be-

378

havior that can be directly tied to a specific neural circuit motif.

380

Distinct functions of adaptation and sensitization in primate retina
Our findings also speak to the roles of neural adaptation in the parasol and broad

381

thorny ganglion cell pathways. Previous work proposed that adapting cells could pro-

382

duce a nearly optimal faithful encoding of sensory inputs (Fairhall et al., 2001). Our

383

computational model, however, indicates that sensitizing circuits outperform adapt-

384

ing circuits in encoding natural movies (Figure 7). The improved reconstruction accu-

385

racy of the sensitizing model was consistent with a recent theoretical report indicating

386

that sensitizing cells are better for encoding faithful representations of sensory input

387

than adapting cells (Młynarski and Hermundstad, 2018). According to this paradigm,

388

sensitizing cells such as midget ganglion cells would be useful for directly encoding

389

information about the properties of the input (e.g., contrast, color). Adapting cells,

390

on the other hand, are optimized for performing inference tasks (Wark et al., 2009;

391

Młynarski and Hermundstad, 2018).

392

Adapting cells dynamically adjust their input-output properties to align with the re-

393

cent stimulus distribution (Baccus and Meister, 2002; Smirnakis et al., 1997). These

394

adjustments make the cells exquisitely sensitive to changes in stimulus statistics, allow-

395

ing them to infer when salient properties of the environment change. For example,

396

quickly detecting object motion is an ethologically relevant and phylogenetically an-

397

cient neural computation (Frost et al., 1990; Lettvin et al., 1959); by decreasing their

398

responsiveness during periods in which the background is either stationary or coher-

399

ently moving, adapting neural circuits would be poised to report when an object moves

400

relative to the background (Olveczky et al., 2003; Puller et al., 2015). Interestingly, both

401

adapting parasol and broad thorny ganglion cells have been implicated in motion pro-

402

cessing (Manookin et al., 2018; Puller et al., 2015) and project to retinorecipient brain re-

403

gions in the lateral geniculate body, superior colliculus, and inferior pulvinar that con-

404

tribute significantly to motion vision (Rodieck and Watanabe, 1993; Crook et al., 2008;

405

Kwan et al., 2018).

406

Relationship to psychophysical measurements in humans

407

It has long been recognized that eye movements play important computational roles

408

in visual processing (reviewed in (Martinez-Conde et al., 2004; Rucci and Victor, 2015)).

409

Periods in which an image is stabilized on the retina cause that image to fade from

410

perception (Troxler, 1804) and small fixational eye movements appear to counteract

411

this fading (Rucci et al., 2007; Schütz et al., 2008). These eye movements can, how19

412

ever, produce large temporal fluctuations in contrast, particularly when viewing high-

413

contrast objects. This would, in turn, produce fading phenomena in cells that strongly

414

adapt, such as parasol ganglion cells—a prediction that was confirmed with our com-

415

putational model (Figure 7).

416

Neural mechanisms such as sensitization may serve to counteract adaptation by main-

417

taining the sensitivity of certain visual pathways during eye movements. Indeed, our

418

computational model and direct measurements indicated that contrast sensitization in

419

the midget ganglion cell pathway was engaged well by background motion such as that

420

observed during eye movements (Figure 7, 8). Thus, contrast sensitization might act

421

to maintain sensitivity of image-forming visual pathways following eye movements

422

that are commonplace in primate vision. Indeed, psychophysical studies in humans

423

indicated that contrast sensitivity increases following both ballistic (saccade) and fixa-

424

tional eye movements (Rucci et al., 2007; Schütz et al., 2008). Moreover, this increase

425

in sensitivity was limited to chromatic stimuli and high-spatial-frequency achromatic

426

stimuli, mirroring our results in midget ganglion cells.

METHODS
427

Experiments were performed in an in vitro, pigment-epithelium attached prepara-

428

tion of the macaque monkey retina (Manookin et al., 2015). Eyes were dissected from

429

terminally anesthetized macaque monkeys of either sex (Macaca fascicularis, mulatta,

430

and nemestrina) obtained through the Tissue Distribution Program of the National Pri-

431

mate Research Center at the University of Washington. All procedures were approved

432

by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

433

Tissue Preparation and Electrophysiology

434

The retina was continuously superfused with warmed (32-35 ◦ C) Ames’ medium

435

(Sigma) at ~6-8 mL min–1 . Recordings were performed from macular, mid-peripheral,

436

or peripheral retina (2-8 mm, 10-30◦ foveal eccentricity), but special emphasis was

437

placed on recording from more centrally located cells. Physiological data were ac-

438

quired at 10 kHz using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), Bessel filtered

439

at 3 kHz (900 CT, Frequency Devices), digitized using an ITC-18 analog-digital board

440

(HEKA Instruments), and acquired using the Symphony acquisition software package

441

developed in Fred Rieke’s laboratory (http://symphony-das.github.io).

442

Recordings were performed using borosilicate glass pipettes containing Ames medium

443

for extracellular spike recording or, for whole-cell recording, a cesium-based internal

444

solution containing (in mM): 105 CsCH3 SO3 , 10 TEA-Cl, 20 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 2 QX-

445

314, 5 Mg-ATP, and 0.5 Tris-GTP, pH ~7.3 with CsOH, ~280 mOsm. Series resistance

446

(~3-9 MΩ) was compensated online by 50%. The membrane potential was corrected

447

offline for the approximately –11 mV liquid junction potential between the intracel-

448

lular solution and the extracellular medium. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic cur-

449

rents were isolated by holding midget ganglion cells at the reversal potentials for in-

450

hibitory/chloride (ECl , ~–70 mV) and excitatory currents (Ecation , 0 mV), respectively.

451

Visual Stimuli and Data Analysis

452

Visual stimuli were generated using the Stage software package developed in the

453

Rieke lab (http://stage-vss.github.io) and displayed on a digital light projector (Lightcrafter

454

4500; Texas Instruments) modified with custom LEDs with peak wavelengths of 405,

455

505 (or 475), and 640 nm. Stimuli were focused on the photoreceptor outer segments

456

through a 10X microscope objective. Mean light levels were in the low to medium

457

photopic regimes (~3 × 103 – 3.4 × 104 photoisomerizations [R*] cone–1 sec–1 ). Con-

458

trast values for contrast-response flashes are given in Weber contrast and for periodic

459

stimuli in Michaelson contrast. All responses were analyzed in MATLAB (R2018a+,

460

Mathworks).

461

For extracellular recordings, currents were wavelet filtered to remove slow drift and

462

amplify spikes relative to the noise (Wiltschko et al., 2008) and spikes were detected

463

using either a custom k-means clustering algorithm or by choosing a manual thresh-

464

old. Whole-cell recordings were leak subtracted and responses were measured relative

465

to the median membrane currents immediately preceding stimulus onset (0.25-0.5 s

466

window). Summary data are presented in terms of conductance (g), which is the ratio

467

of the current response (I) to the driving force:

g=

I
Vm − E

(1)

468

where V m is the holding potential (in mV) and E is the reversal potential (in mV). Re-

469

versal potentials of 0 mV and –70 mV were used for excitatory and inhibitory inputs,

470

respectively.

471

Sensitization and adaptation models

472

We modeled spatiotemporal integration in bipolar cells and amacrine cells as the

473

product of a Gaussian spatial filter and a biphasic temporal filter which was then passed

474

through an input-output nonlinearity. The output of this nonlinear stage of the amacrine

475

cell model was then passed through an adaptation stage; adaptation in the amacrine

476

cell provided inhibitory input to the bipolar cell model prior to the output nonlinearity

477

(Figure 6A). Following the subunit output, model midget ganglion cells and amacrine

478

cells pooled (summed) inputs from bipolar cell subunits and the weights of these inputs

479

were normalized by the subunit location relative to the receptive field center using a

480

Gaussian weighting.

481

To estimate the excitatory and inhibitory circuit components for the computational

482

model, we recorded excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents from midget ganglion

483

cells in response to a full-field Gaussian flicker stimulus. The contrast of each frame

484

was drawn randomly from a Gaussian distribution and that value was multiplied by

485

the average contrast. Average contrast was updated every 0.5 s and drawn from a uni-

486

form distribution (0.05-0.35 RMS contrast). The linear temporal filters (F) were calcu-

487

lated by cross-correlating the stimulus sequence (S) and the leak-subtracted response

488

(R) (Baccus and Meister, 2002).

F (t) =

where τ is the temporal lag. These filters were then modeled as a damped oscillator

with an S-shaped onset (Schnapf et al., 1990; Angueyra and Rieke, 2013):

where A is a scaling factor, τ rise is the rising-phase time constant, τ decay is the damping

time constant, τ period is the oscillator period, and φ is the phase (in degrees).

The input-output nonlinearity was calculated by convolving the temporal filter (F)
and stimulus (S) to generate the linear prediction (P).

499

The spatial component of the bipolar and amacrine cell receptive fields was modeled

500

as a Gaussian function with a 2-SD width of 18 µm and 90 µm, respectively. Each

501

midget ganglion cell was modeled as receiving input from a single bipolar cell, as is

502

typically the case in the central retina. Sensitization parameters were determined by

503

fitting linear-nonlinear model predictions relative to the excitatory currents recorded

504

to the Gaussian flicker stimulus.

505

The amacrine cell providing direct inhibition to the midget ganglion cells is likely

506

distinct from the cell providing presynaptic inhibition at the level of the midget bipo-

507

lar cell (see Figure 5). Thus, our inhibitory synaptic recordings likely did not grant us

508

direct access to the properties of the amacrine cell responsible for contrast sensitiza-

509

tion. These recordings do, however, provide an estimate of the time-course of signals

510

passing through the presynaptic amacrine cell to midget bipolar cells. Signals passing

511

through this amacrine cell proceed from cone photoreceptors to bipolar cells and then

512

to the amacrine cell in question before providing input to the midget bipolar cell. In

513

the same way, the amacrine cell providing direct inhibition to midget ganglion cells

514

must pass through an extra synapse. Thus, our recordings of direct synaptic inhibition

515

were useful in approximating the time course of presynaptic inhibition at the midget

516

bipolar terminal.

517

Evaluating model performance to naturalistic movies

518

We evaluated the performance of the adaptation and sensitization models in re-

519

constructing the naturalistic movie sequences using linear and quadratic decoding

520

paradigms. To estimate stimulus contrast, the linear decoder (f LINEAR ) summed the

521

scaled outputs of the model On and Off midget ganglion cells:

flinear (t) = aon ron (t) + aoff roff (t) + k

522

(6)

where aON and aOFF are scaling constants and k is an offset constant. The quadratic

model was similar in structure except that the response from each pathways was squared

(t) + aoff1 roff (t) + aoff2 roff

525

For each of the 161 movies in the database, the input stimulus was shifted to the

526

peak of the midget temporal filter (~35 ms) and then scaling and offset coefficients

527

were determined using least-squares curve fitting. The Pearson correlation was then

528

calculated between the temporal trajectories of the model and the movie.
