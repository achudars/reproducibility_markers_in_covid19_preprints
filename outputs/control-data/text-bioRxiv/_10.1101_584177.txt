The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to adapt to diverse stresses
in its host environment is crucial for pathogenesis. Two essential Mtb serine/threonine protein kinases, PknA and PknB, regulate cell growth in response to environmental stimuli, but little is known about their downstream effects. By combining RNA-Seq data, following treatment with either a PknA/PknB
inhibitor or an inactive control, with publicly available ChIP-Seq and protein-

protein interaction data, we show that the Mtb transcription factor (TF) regulatory network propagates the effects of kinase inhibition and leads to widespread
changes in regulatory programs involved in cell wall integrity, stress response,
and energy production, among others. We also observe that changes in TF regulatory activity correlate with kinase-specific phosphorylation of those TFs. In
addition to characterizing the downstream regulatory effects of PknA/PknB
inhibition, this demonstrates the need for regulatory network approaches that
can incorporate signal-driven transcription factor modifications.

Introduction
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains one of the world’s deadliest pathogens, with 10.4
million people falling ill with tuberculosis disease (TB) and over 1.6 million TB deaths in 2016
(1). The emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mtb strains threatens
to undermine global TB control efforts.
Much of Mtb’s success as a pathogen can be attributed to its ability to adapt to diverse environmental stresses encountered during the course of chronic infection (2). Protein kinases
anchored on the mycobacterial cytoplasmic membrane are critical for responding to environmental stimuli and transducing signals to various cellular processes (3). The essential Mtb
serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) PknA and PknB are excellent targets to characterize
in the context of future drug development, as they regulate several processes required for cell
growth and division, including the biosynthesis of essential components of the cell envelope
(peptidoglycan, mycolic acids, and other cell wall lipids and carbohydrates) (4). For example,
cells in which PknA or PknB gene expression was inhibited displayed an abnormal shape, indicating the two kinases are key regulators of cell division and cell shape in Mtb (5). However, our
understanding of the downstream transcriptional pathways by which PknA and PknB regulate

these and other cellular processes is limited, and the basis of their essentiality is unknown.
To measure the downstream effects of PknA/PknB signaling, we used a potent small molecule
inhibitor of both PknA and PknB along with an inactive negative control, then collected multiple omics data types as detailed in (6). To follow the propagation of this signaling perturbation,
we sought to identify differences in transcription factor (TF) regulation in the inhibitor- and
control-treated gene expression programs by reconstructing TF regulatory networks in the active (i.e. inhibitor) and control conditions. While condition-specific binding information for all
TFs was not available, we combined recently generated ChIP-seq data for 143 TFs (as defined
in (7)) in Mtb and protein-protein interaction data (8) with RNA-Seq data from inhibitor or control treated samples using the TF regulatory network reconstruction algorithm PANDA (9) (see
Figure 1).
By comparing network topologies of these inhibitor and control networks, we first identify
TFs that change their regulation in response to PknA/PknB inhibition as measured by change in
network outdegree (sum of outbound links). We also show that change in network outdegree is
predictive of change in phosphorylation status of the TF after PknA/PknB inhibition, suggesting
that our network approach is modeling the downstream effects of the kinase inhibition. Second,
we show that genes that are differentially regulated as measured by their change in indegree
(sum of inbound links) are enriched for multiple functions, including mycobactin synthesis,
with additional validation that mycobactin levels are indeed changed upon PknA/PknB inhibition (6). Third, we demonstrate that network “communities” (modules) in the inhibitor-treated
network show condition-specific functional enrichment, which are validated by follow-up experiments.

the signaling perturbation of PknA/PknB inhibition was detected in our networks, we used
phosphoproteomic data collected from samples treated with the PknA/PknB inhibitor or control
and calculated log2 fold change values to determine phosphorylation status of the TFs in our
networks. Peptides for 14 TFs were detected, 11 of which were differentially phosphorylated
at an adjusted P-value < 0.05. We then compared the change in outdegree (defined as the
sum of all out-going edge weights) between the inhibitor and control networks for each TF
to the change in phosphorylation (see Figure 2) and find that these are significantly correlated
(Spearman’s rho of 0.618, P = 0.0213). MtrA is one such TF. It has the 13th (out of 143)
largest change in outdegree between the inhibitor and control networks. MtrA is also ranked
third in differential phosphorylation among the 14 TFs measured (see Fig. 2). We also recently
demonstrated that phosphorylation of MtrA inhibits DNA binding to the FbpB promoter (6).
This discovery suggests that changes in transcriptional regulation in response to PknA/PknB
inhibition can be partly attributed to differential phosphorylation of TFs. In particular, CsoR,
the most positively differentially targeting TF, is significantly differentially phosphorylated with
a log2 fold change of -1.89. That the majority (8/11) of differentially phosphorylated TFs in
the network have decreased outdegree in the inhibitor versus control network likely reflects the
disruption of gene regulatory programs in response to PknA/PknB inhibition (i.e. genes in TF
regulons have less correlated expression).
Comparing networks uncovers PknA/PknB-specific targeting patterns of TFs. The
PknA/PknB-specific TFs (Table 1 and S1 Table) are involved in processes we expect to be
differentially regulated in the context of PknA/PknB inhibition. To assess this in the network
context, we define “differential targeting” to mean the change in a TF’s outdegree between
active control and kinase inhibitor networks. Rv0081, the most differentially targeting TF, is
a regulatory hub in the context of hypoxia, a condition which induces a stress response with
similarities to PknA/PknB inhibition (10). Other top differentially targeting TFs include the

response regulator TrcR, which activates its own coding gene expression and represses Rv1057,
a β-propeller protein gene whose expression is also mediated by SigE (11). Lsr2 is a global
transcriptional regulator that may be responsible for many cell wall functions and is required
for adaptation to changing oxygen levels (12, 13). CsoR, the TF with the greatest increase in
targeting in kinase inhibitor treated cells, is a copper sensing transcriptional regulator that may
promote Mtb survival by mediating a response to copper toxicity (14). KstR, a transcriptional
repressor, controls a number of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid catabolism (15).
Thus, each of the top 10 PknA/PknB-specific TFs with known function is involved in either
signal transduction, cell wall function, or lipid metabolism–processes which PknA and PknB
regulate. Given this, we propose Rv0678, Rv0324, Rv0465c, Rv1985c, and Rv0023, which
have unknown functions, to be candidate downstream regulators most affected by PknA/PknB
inhibition as determined by change in outdegree.
Among the genes that are “differentially targeted”, which we define as the difference in
gene indegree between control and inhibitor networks (Table 2 and S2 Table), we discovered many genes with interesting functions that may play important roles in responding to
PknA/PknB inhibition. VapB30 and VapB40 are antitoxins in the VapBC (Virulence associated protein) family of toxin-antitoxin systems that regulate translation in response to diverse
environmental stresses (16), and both VapB30 and VapB40 have increased gene expression and
increased indegree in kinase inhibitor treated cells. CysD is involved in sulfur metabolism,
which may be important in the virulence, antibiotic resistance, and antioxidant defense mechanisms of Mtb (17). ArgC, N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase, is involved in arginine biosynthesis, an essential metabolic function for cellular growth and a pathway that is
required for virulence (18, 19).
Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for difference in indegree, we identified PknA/PknBspecific functional categories (S3 Table). “Mycobactin biosynthesis,” “phosphopantetheine

binding,” and “ESX-1 LOCUS” show increased targeting in the inhibitor condition, and “Oxidative phosphorylation,” “quinone binding,” and “NADH dehydrogenase” show decreased targeting. Mycobactins are essential for iron acquisition within the host environment (20), and
in related work (Figure 4 of (6)), we found that mycobactin levels were increased 48 hours
after inhibition of PknA/PknB. “Phosphopantetheine binding” consists of 15 genes, including
polyketide synthases crucial for fatty acid synthesis (21) and enzymes involved in mycobactin
synthesis (22). The ESX-1 system is a specialized secretion system required for virulence (23).
Oxidative phosphorylation, quinone binding, and NADH dehydrogenase genes are less targeted
after PknA/PknB inhibition, supporting their role in mediating a compensatory biological response in the form of lowered energy expenditure and growth arrest.
Network clustering reveals condition-specific communities with different biological
functions. While differential targeting analysis gives insight at the whole-network level, we
aimed to understand biological organization at a more modular level. Because PANDA models
groups of TFs regulating groups of genes, we naturally partitioned the nodes from each network
into communities. To facilitate comparison of the network clusterings, we considered only the
set of edges with positive edge weights (z-score greater than 0) in both conditions. This resulted
in a Giant Connected Component (GCC) containing 67,740 edges between 143 TFs and 3971
genes. Genes that are also TFs were included as separate nodes in the network. As a network diagnostic, we plotted the distributions of edges per TF (outdegree) and edges per gene (indegree)
(S1 Fig).
Next, we used CONDOR (COmplex Network Description Of Regulators), an R package for
bipartite network analysis (24), to detect communities independently in each PANDA network.
CONDOR maximizes the modularity, a score that can be interpreted as an enrichment for links
within communities minus an expected enrichment given the network degree distribution.
This analysis identified 21 communities in the inhibitor network and 24 communities in

the control network, with similar modularities of 0.495 and 0.504, respectively, and similar
membership (S2 Fig). By testing each community as a whole for functional enrichment (see
Methods), we found 4 of the 21 communities in the inhibitor network and 3 of the 24 communities in the control network to be functionally enriched (F DR < 0.05; overlap> 4) in one
or more functional categories (S4 Table and S5 Table). This functional enrichment is robust
to the choice of edge-weight threshold (Fig. S3). The differences in the enrichment identified
between conditions are relevant in the context of PknA/PknB inhibition. For example, response
to stress is enriched in a community in the inhibitor but not the control network; 11 of 26 genes
in the functional category are assigned to community 2 in the inhibitor network, suggesting that
these genes are cooperatively regulated in response to PknA/PknB inhibition. In addition to the
activation of stress response, the results suggest that energy metabolism and ATP production
regulation change in response to PknA/PknB inhibition.
To validate the network finding that ATP metabolism is disrupted by inhibition of PknA/PknB,
we quantified the level of ATP in both the control and inhibitor treated cells at 12, 24, and 48
hours. After normalizing based on residual protein quantity (see Methods), we observed higher
levels of ATP at all time points in the inhibitor treated samples compared to the control treatment
(Fig. 4).
Conclusion. As multi-omic data acquisition becomes increasingly commonplace, researchers
interested in the drivers of complex phenotypes will face a new intellectual challenge: given a
wealth of omics data, how can one identify relevant regulatory relationships amidst an abundance of correlations and partial correlations within and across data types? One solution to
this challenge is to build regulatory networks that move beyond simple correlations by creating
models that are consistent with known mechanisms of gene regulation. Here we applied one
such algorithm, PANDA, to estimate the TF regulatory network response to an antimicrobial
compound that inhibits two key signaling molecules important for cell wall function and stress

response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, PknA and PknB.
By comparing the regulatory networks from samples treated with either the PknA/PknB
inhibitor or an inactive control compound, we identified treatment-specific network changes and
provide validation for multiple network-generated hypotheses. This includes the observation
that changes in TF outdegree correlated with changes in TF phosphorylation, suggesting that
the PANDA regulatory networks successfully captured the relevant downstream effects of the
perturbation. We identified “differentially targeting” PknA/PknB-specific TFs (based on change
in TF outdegree) that affect diverse biological functions associated with signal transduction,
cell wall function, and lipid metabolism. Additionally, we identified “differentially targeted”
PknA/PknB-specific genes (based on change in gene indegree) that our models predict have
a condition-specific pattern of regulation. In the case of mycobactin synthesis, these network
changes are corroborated by changes in mycobactin lipid levels.
Networks are known to exhibit complex substructure, and we found the inferred regulatory networks are organized into “communities” of TFs and genes collectively associated with
regulation of distinct biological processes. We used a bipartite community detection method
to explore the structure of the Mtb regulatory network and found communities of genes and
TFs that display condition-specific pathway enrichment. These include an inhibitor-specific
community over-represented for genes involved in ATP production; this result was validated
experimentally.
Taken together, these results demonstrate gene regulatory network inference using PANDA
can effectively integrate multi-omic data and infer regulatory networks that capture downstream
signaling effects. This, combined with advances in high-throughput methods for measuring
phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions (25), creates new opportunities for the
functional characterization of drug candidates in Mtb. Approaches such as those described here
will be essential for finding interventions in a disease that is already a substantial threat to

Reconstructing PANDA networks
PANDA requires three inputs: a regulatory network prior of known TF-gene binding interactions, a protein cooperativity network prior of known protein-protein interactions, and expression data. We ran PANDA twice with the default update parameter (α = 0.10) using the same
TF-gene and protein-protein interaction priors, but with gene expression data unique to samples treated with the active compound or control compound. Analyses were robust to different
choices of the update parameter, α. PANDA outputs a final regulatory network, a final proteincooperativity network, and a final co-expression network. All downstream analysis used only
the regulatory network, which is represented by a collection of inferred TF-gene regulatory
interactions.

PANDA regulatory network prior
We created the regulatory network prior using ChIP-seq data from the supplemental material
of (7). The regulatory network prior contains 6517 TF binding interactions between 143 TFs and
2501 genes, filtered by significance (P < 0.01) and located within the -150 to +70 nucleotide
promoter window. In reconstructing networks, we consider only these 143 TFs as defined in (7)
as potential regulators.
PANDA Protein-cooperativity network prior
Predicted interactions between TFs were obtained from STRING v10 (8). We filtered these
interactions to include only those between the 143 TFs in our regulatory network prior.
ATP quantification
Triplicate samples from three individual experiments were grown and harvested at serial time
points as previously described (6). Metabolic activity was rapidly quenched by placing the bacteria directly into 40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol, 20% water previously cooled on dry ice.
The cells were then mechanically disrupted with 0.1 mm Zirconia beads in a MagNA Lyser
instrument (Roche) by agitating the samples 4 times at 7000 rpm for 45 seconds with a cooling
step at -20◦ C for 5 minutes between each cycle. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation
(10000g, 10 min, 4◦ C) and filtered through a 0.22 µm filter (Costar R #8160). ATP quantification was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions of the ATP Colorimetric /
Fluorometric Assay kit (BioVision #K354-100) and normalized to the residual protein quantity,
determined by the Pierce

TM

BCA Protein Assay kit (ThermoFisher #23227).

(26). We removed duplications and functional categories matching the regular expression

Statistical significance of PknA/PknB-specific TFs and genes
We used permutation testing to calculate empirical P-values for the significance of differential
targeting for each TF and gene. To do this, we ran PANDA for each of 1000 randomized
gene expression matrices with permuted gene labels. For each TF/gene, we then calculated
significance by determining the proportion of the out/indegree differences for the 1000 runs
that were greater the observed out/indegree if positive, or less than the observed out/indegree if
negative.
Bipartite network community detection
We used the CONDOR R package (24) with project=FALSE and other parameters set to default
to detect communities in the inhibitor and control networks separately. These two networks
contained the same subset of edges, but had different edge weights based on the output from
running PANDA with data from the two conditions. Edges with weight < 0 in either network
were removed from both networks.
Functional enrichment analysis
To identify PknA/PknB-specific functional categories, we ran GSEA Preranked, which we
downloaded from www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/ as the Java version. We ranked TFs/genes by
their difference (inhibitor - control) in indegree/outdegree and ran GSEA using a minimum gene
set size of 10 and a maximum size of 250. We report significant results (F DR < 0.1), with
positive and negative enrichment scores representing enrichment in the inhibitor and control
treatments, respectively. We used the one-sided Fisher’s Exact Test to evaluate the significance
of each functional category for a given gene set. We required a minimum overlap of five genes

Figure 1: Summary of the experimental design and network comparisons. Using a message
passing framework (9) (see Methods) we integrated ChIP-seq and protein-protein interaction
(PPI) data with condition-specific gene expression data to build kinase-inhibitor and control
gene regulatory networks. Network edges connect TFs to genes and are weighted to reflect
the confidence (in z-score units) of a regulatory relationship based on the concordance between
omics data types. The TF node degree is defined as the sum of all weights for edges emanating
from the TF, and gene degree is the sum of all weights for edges terminating at the gene. The
inhibitor and control networks were clustered into groups containing both TFs and genes using
bipartite community detection (24, 27) as detailed in the Methods.

Figure 2: Change in transcription factor phosphorylation is correlated with change in
outdegree. (A) The outdegree difference (y-axis) and rank of outdegree difference (x-axis) are
shown for the 143 transcription factors included in the regulatory network model. Of those, 14
TFs had detected phosphopeptides and 11 were differentially phosphorylated (adj. P < 0.05,
shown in red). (B) The magnitude of change in TF outdegree between active and control kinase
inhibitor networks correlates with change in phosphorylation (Spearman correlation, ρs = 0.618
and P = 0.0213). The median log2 fold change was used when multiple phosphopeptides were
detected for the same protein.

Figure 3: The transcriptional response of the CsoR regulon to PknA/PknB inhibition mirrors that of copper exposure. Log2 fold changes in RNA for genes in the CsoR regulon after
treatment with the PknA/PknB inhibitor are shown in blue, changes in RNA after treatment with
copper are shown in red (copper data from (28)). The copper sensitive operon repressor (CsoR)
showed the greatest change in phosophorylation and increase in outdegree upon PknA/PknB
inhibition (see Fig. 2).

Figure 4: ATP production increases after inhibition of PknA/PknB. (A) ATP levels are
higher for inhibitor treated samples compared to controls at all time points and (B) across three
biological replicates (P = 3.213 × 10−10 for t-test comparing inhibitor vs control). Samples
were normalized to the amount of residual protein (see Methods for details).
