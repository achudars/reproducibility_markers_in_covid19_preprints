Abstract/Keywords
To determine if living microorganisms of phytosanitary concern are present in wood after

15

eradication treatment and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatments, the method of choice is to grow

16

microbes in petri dishes for subsequent identification. However, some plant pathogens are difficult or

17

impossible to grow in axenic cultures. A molecular methodology capable of detecting living fungi and

18

fungus-like organisms in situ can provide a solution. RNA represents the transcription of genes and can

19

therefore only be produced by living organisms, providing a proxy for viability. We designed and used

20

RNA-based molecular diagnostic assays targeting genes essential to vital processes and assessed their

21

presence in wood colonized by fungi and oomycetes through reverse transcription and real-time

22

polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A stability analysis was conducted by comparing the ratio of mRNA to

23

gDNA over time following heat treatment of wood infected with the Oomycete Phytophthora ramorum

24

and the fungus Grosmannia clavigera. The real-time PCR results indicated that the DNA remained stable

25

over a period of 10 days post treatment in heat-treated wood samples, whereas mRNA could not be

26

detected after 24 hours for P. ramorum or 96 hours for G. clavigera. Therefore, this method provides a

27

reliable way to evaluate the viability of these pathogens and test the effectiveness of existing and

Introduction

32

Wood and wood products can harbor microorganisms that can raise phytosanitary concerns in

33

countries importing or exporting these products [1–3] . Various treatments have been developed and

34

can be applied to eliminate organisms present in wood [3]. The two most widely used treatments are

35

heat and fumigation of timber and wood products performed according to international phytosanitary

36

standards ISPM 15 and ISPM 39 [4]. These methods are efficient for the elimination of insects but their

37

efficacy in eliminating microorganisms can vary and is not always well documented. To evaluate the

38

efficacy of these treatments the presence of microorganisms must be assessed following treatment of

39

the wood products, generally using approaches based on the isolation and cultures of the

40

microorganisms. However, culture-based methods have limitations as it is now estimated that only a

41

small fraction of the microorganisms present in natural environments can be grown on artificial media

42

[5,6]. In addition, some fungi grow slowly and rely on complex nutrient requirements. This is the case of

43

certain fungi that are outcompeted by fast-growing saprophytic species [7]. These short-comings could

44

generate false negatives, i.e. the failure to detect microorganisms that are still viable following a

45

treatment that is inefficient. An additional challenge is that the paucity and sometimes inadequacy of

46

distinguishing morphological traits complicates the identification of microorganisms [8,9].

47

The use of molecular methods, in particular DNA amplification of universal genes using the

48

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), followed by amplicon sequencing and DNA barcoding (matching the

49

unknown sequence by homology in public sequence databases to provide identity), have become the

50

standard in identification of fungi and oomycetes [10–12]. Real-time PCR , a method that uses

51

fluorescent dyes for detection of target genomic DNA (gDNA) during the amplification process has

52

increasingly replaced conventional PCR [10,13]. However, molecular detection methods are generally

53

based on the detection of pathogen gDNA and therefore aim at detecting the presence, but not the

54

viability, of the organism. Since DNA is stable and does not rapidly degrade following cell death, these

55

assays are not useful to assess the viability of the targeted organisms and thus cannot help in

56

determining the efficacy of a phytosanitary treatment. In contrast, messenger RNA (mRNA) degrades

57

more rapidly after cell death[14–16], and is only produced by metabolically active cells, making it

58

suitable to specifically detect living microorganisms [17].

59

To develop qPCR assays that can detect and quantify pathogen mRNA to assess its viability, it is

60

necessary to produce complementary DNA (cDNA), which is the double-stranded DNA synthesized from

61

a single stranded RNA (e.g., mRNA template in a reaction catalyzed by the reverse transcriptase

62

enzyme). Complementary DNA amplified by PCR can then be used to measure the expression of mRNA

63

and serve as a marker of cell viability. Because introns are spliced out in mature mRNA, transcripts can

64

be distinguished from gDNA. It is therefore possible to design assays utilizing a probe or primer that

65

spans the exon-exon junction so that it can anneal to mRNA but not gDNA. This allows detection and

66

quantification of mRNA without cross-amplification of the gDNA [18,19].

67

Herein, we are reporting the design and validation of assays that amplify and provide a relative

68

quantification of the mRNA over gDNA of two microorganisms that can colonize wood: the oomycete

69

Phytophthora ramorum, causal agent of sudden oak death and sudden larch death [20–22], and the blue

70

stain ascomycete fungus Grosmannia clavigera, an important symbiont of the mountain pine beetle

71

[23,24]. Since these two organisms belong to different kingdoms we are using them as a case-study for

72

the development of a method that will be used to assess the viability of infectious microorganisms

73

following wood treatments and evaluate the efficacy of such treatments.

Materials and Methods

75

Design of Assays

76

The program ‘‘PHYLORPH’’ (PHYLogenetic markers for ORPHans) was used to reconstruct the gene

77

alignments with intron/exons junctions for P. ramorum (Pr-102 [ATCC MYA-2949];[25]) and other closely

78

related species [26]. Conserved proteins for P. ramorum were identified by performing a BLAST (Basic

79

Local Alignment Search Tool) search with the CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach)

80

protein database [27] against the genome sequences of P. lateralis (GCA_000500205.2), P. hibernalis, P.

81

foliorum, P. syringuae and P. brassicae [28] (Brett Tyler, Oregon State University, Personal

82

communication). These genes are expected to be expressed under various conditions in living

83

organisms, an important criterion in developing assays to assess viability. A total of 43 candidate gene

84

alignments were obtained from which seven primer pairs targeting P. ramorum were designed, on two

85

adjacent exons separated by a short intron sequence (<95 bp in length.), using Geneious (v8.1.6). Primer

86

pairs were screened for specificity using PCR with electrophoresis on gDNA extracted from cultures of 10

87

Phytophthora species from clade 8 (P. lateralis, P. brassicae, P. cryptogea, P. drechsleri, P. foliorum, P.

88

hibernalis, P. porri, P. primulae and P. syringae ) which are closely related to P. ramorum [29].

89

The same procedure was performed on the G. clavigera genome (isolate kw1407;[30]) using the

90

FUNYBASE protein database [31] against the genomes of Leptographium longiclavatum, Neurospora

91

crassa (GCA_000182925), Ophiostoma montium, O. piceae (GCA_000410735), O. novo-ulmi

92

(GCA_000317715) and Sporothrix schenkii (GCA_000474925) [32–34]. The search returned 158

93

candidate alignments from which primer pairs targeting G. clavigera were designed and tested on gDNA

94

from cultures of the sister species L. longiclavatum, L. terebrantis, L. wingfieldi and O. montium.

95
96

For candidate alignments that successfully passed PCR specificity testing, two real-time TaqMan
PCR probes were designed as follows: a probe used for the detection of gDNA was designed within the

97

intron sequence located between the two primer pairs, whereas a probe targeting the cDNA was

98

designed to span the exon-exon junction (Fig. 1A and B). All assays were then optimized for use in

99

identifying mRNA stability. To determine the real-time PCR efficiency for each primer pair and probe a

100

five-point standard curve was developed over a range of 10-fold dilutions from 10ng/µl to 1pg/µl of

101

gDNA.

102

Wood Inoculation

103

Eight isolates of P. ramorum (two from each phylogenetic lineage i.e. EU1, EU2, NA1 and NA2,

104

[20]; Appendix 1) and one G. clavigera isolate were used for the wood inoculations. They were obtained

105

from long term storage, plated on carrot and malt extract (MEA) agar, and sub-cultured to fresh plates

106

10 days prior to inoculation. In order to simulate live infection on the host, living trees were freshly

107

felled and prepared for the artificial inoculation. Three tree species were used for the P. ramorum

108

inoculations: Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi) and Western hemlock

109

(Tsuga heterophylla). Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) was used for G. clavigera inoculation. Logs (~12cm

110

or greater in dbh) were brushed to get rid of excess debris, rinsed with water cut into 0.5 m long bolts

111

and inoculated with P. ramorum, G. clavigera or a blank agar plug used as a negative control as

112

described in [20]. Inoculated bolts were misted with water and placed in plastic bags for 28 days.

113

Heat treatment to determine mRNA stability

114

Pure cultures of P. ramorum and G. clavigera were subjected to two heat treatments: 1) a

115

simulated spruce-pine-fir (SPF) kiln-drying schedule (from 15oC to 70oC for 7 hours) used to treat wood

116

under the standards approved by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) [35]; and 2) , exposure of

117

the pathogens to 70oC for 1 hour. Phytophthora ramorum isolate PFC-5073 [lineage NA2] and G.

118

clavigera isolate KW1407 were grown on cellophane on V8 and MEA media (three replicates per time

119

point). For the SPF kiln-drying schedule, mycelium was transferred from petri plates into 0.1mL PCR strip

120

tubes and placed into a thermocycler. In parallel, one 1.5ml Eppendorf tube containing 30 mg of mycelia

121

was immediately frozen to serve as a no-heat treatment control. The thermocycler was used to conduct

122

a long heat treatment that simulated the kiln-drying schedule. The mycelium was sampled at 8 time

123

points: 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 168 and 240 hours after the treatment. At each time point two mycelial

124

samples were collected: one was transferred into a 1.5 ml microtube, submerged in liquid nitrogen and

125

stored at -80oC for subsequent DNA and RNA extractions; the other one was plated on three clarified V8

126

(P. ramorum) or MEA (G. clavigera) agar petri dishes and incubated in a dark growth chamber at room

127

temperature for 28 days. For the short heat treatment, a laboratory oven was preheated to 70oC to

128

incubate 24 replicate plates of the P. ramorum and G. clavigera isolates for 1 hour. After this treatment,

129

all plates were removed from the oven and set aside at room temperature before collection at the time-

130

points mentioned above. Mycelial samples were collected and stored as previously described for the SPF

131

kiln-drying schedule.

132
133

Chlamydospores Separation
Chlamydospore harvesting from P. ramorum was carried out according to Tsao [36] with the

134

following modifications. Non-blended fungal mats were transferred onto a 75µm falcon filter in a 50ml

135

falcon tube. Using sterile dH2O, these mats were rinsed while being patted with a rubber policeman until

136

the volume of water in the falcon tubes reached approximately 10-20 ml. This was repeated twice. The

137

tubes were then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 2 min, and the supernatant was removed. The

138

chlamydospore suspensions were then aliquoted into several 1.7 ml micro-tubes and centrifuged at

139

8000 x g for 5 min removing the supernatant. The pellets were then resuspended, combined and

140

centrifuged at 6,000 x g for 5 min and the supernatant discarded. Final concentration of the spores

141

should be approximately 1x105 chlamydospore/ml using a hemocytometer. The obtained spore

142

suspension was centrifuged at 6000 x g for 5 min, discarding the supernatant. The pellets were then

143

suspended to a minimum volume (approximately 50µl). The chlamydospore suspension was transferred

146

RNA and DNA extractions

147

Wood samples were collected, immediately dipped in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80oC. Fifty

148

to 80 mg of wood scrapings were collected at each inoculation point from 8 logs of 4 conifer species and

149

used for the simultaneous extractions of gDNA and RNA. Wood samples inoculated with G. clavigera

150

were placed in 15 ml vials with two 10 mm stainless steel balls and were submerged in liquid nitrogen to

151

keep the samples frozen. Vials were then placed in the Geno/Grinder (SPEX SamplePrep 2010,

152

Metuchen, New Jersey, USA) at 15,000 rpm for 30 seconds. Wood samples inoculated with P. ramorum

153

were hand-ground using a mortar and pestle. Mycelial samples of P. ramorum were placed in lysing

154

matrix C (MPBiomedicals, Santa Ana, CA). All samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground in a

155

FastPrep-24 homogenizer (MPBiomedicals) at 5.5 rpm for 30 seconds and re-submerged in liquid

156

nitrogen. For G. clavigera, samples were removed from the freezer and submerged in liquid nitrogen to

157

inhibit RNA degradation. Samples were individually placed in a mortar, immersed in liquid nitrogen then

158

ground up into fine powder.

159

Simultaneous extraction of gDNA and RNA was performed using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro kit

160

(QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) following manufacturer instructions. Genomic DNA concentration was

161

measured using the Qubit fluorometer and all culture samples were diluted down to 1ng/µl using dH20.

162

The concentration of RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer before

163

diluting down to 10ng/ul.

167

volume of RNase-free water for a total of 14 µl was used in the first step. Then 1 µl of Quantiscript

168

Reverse Transcriptase, 4 µl of Quantiscript RT Buffer (5x) and 1 µl of RT primer mix was added to the

169

gDNA eliminated solution.

170

Two TaqMan reactions per time point were performed for the measure of mRNA stability post

171

heat treatment. This allowed differentiation of either gDNA or cDNA with their corresponding probes.

172

Real-time PCR mix included 0.5X Quantifast Multiplex PCR MasterMix (QIAGEN), 400 mM of each

173

forward and reverse primer, 20 mM of TaqMan probe and 2.2 ng of template (gDNA or cDNA) for a final

174

volume of 10 µl. Thermal cycling parameters used were 5 minutes at 95oC for enzyme activation,

175

followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95oC for 30 seconds and 60 seconds of annealing/extensions at

176

60oC.

177

For the chlamydospore testing real-time PCR of gDNA (100 ng/µl) and cDNA (55ng/µl) were

178

carried out for two different P. ramorum isolates (5086 and 101329) in biological duplicates and sample

179

triplicates.

180

Statistical analysis

181

The proportion of viable pathogen was estimated by using the ratio of mRNA over gDNA

182

quantity i.e. cycle-threshold value (Ct) ratio of the real-time PCR probe targeting cDNA over Ct value of

183

the probe targeting gDNA. This ratio was the unit of measurement used to compare the efficacy of heat

184

treatment. Using statistical analysis software (SAS 9.4), the significance of the treatment values were

185

tested using a two-factor ANOVA split plot, where factor A is heat treatment and factor B is sampling

186

time points after treatments.

RESULTS

189

PCR assay design and performance

190

Five out of the six primer pairs targeting P. ramorum were eliminated because of the presence

191

of detectable amplification products on the agarose gel when tested with P. lateralis DNA. The primer

192

pair left (PH178) targets portions of a gene (Protein ID 74159; [25]) encoding for a predicted SNARE

193

associated Golgi protein (Fig. 1A) and yielded amplification products only with gDNA of P. ramorum. This

194

gene was highly expressed in two mRNA profiling experiments with mycelial colonies of P. ramorum

195

growing on agar media [37,38].

198

All 11 primer pairs designed to target G. clavigera crossed-reacted with at least one non-target

199

species. The primer pair targeting gene MS359 yielded a PCR product with all G. clavigera isolates tested

200

and its sister species L. longiclavatum (100% similarity with G. clavigera in the ribosomal internal

201

transcribed spacer and 97.5% similarity at the genome level). Since these sister species occupy a similar

202

niche (mountain pine beetle galleries) and have similar biology [39], we selected the assay targeting this

203

gene to develop the mRNA assay (Fig. 1B). MS359 (=G. clavigera GLEAN_5973; [30]) encodes for a

204

putative NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrafolate dehydrogenase that is involved in the glyoxylate

205

and dicarboxylate metabolism pathway and is known to be expressed in growing mycelium and non-

206

germinated spores and showed high expression levels in RNAseq experiments at 12 and 36 h post-

207

inoculation on media supplemented with host-defense metabolites and untreated control media

208

[30,40].

209

We verified the presence of an intron in the gDNA samples by comparing the size of the PCR

210

products obtained by amplification of the gDNA and cDNA reverse-transcribed from mRNA of the same

211

samples. A smaller amplification product was obtained in the PCR of the cDNA (84 bp) than the gDNA

212

(157 bp) of gene PH178, confirming the presence of the intron in the gDNA of P. ramorum (Fig. 1A).

213

Similarly, we observed a difference in amplicon product sizes between cDNA (149 bp) and gDNA (199

214

bp) in MS359 of G. clavigera (Fig. 1B).

215

TaqMan probes were added to the two selected primer pairs to design real-time PCR assays that

216

were tested for amplification efficiency on serial dilutions of gDNA. For the assay PH178 targeting P.

217

ramorum, the standard curve yielded a regression coefficient of 0.998 indicating low variability between

218

independent DNA isolations and an amplification efficiency of 92.3% (Fig. 2A). Efficiency of the MS359

219

assay targeting G. clavigera was higher (100.3%), and variability slightly lower with a regression

220

coefficient of 0.981 (Fig. 2B).

For each combination of isolate x tree species tested a necrotic lesion was observed around the

these inoculated wood samples was successfully detected by their respective real-time PCR assay with Ct

values ranging from 24.13 (G. clavigera inoculated on P. contorta) to 29.4 (P. ramorum inoculated on L.

higher, ranging from 27.4 (G. clavigera x P. contorta) to 33.4 (P. ramorum x L. kampferi) with an average

of 31.2 (±2.77), indicating later detections than for gDNA (Fig. 3).

gDNA and cDNA synthetized from mRNA extracted from 28 day post inoculation lesion was tested in

We tested the efficiency of the PH178 assay on nucleic-acids extracted from P. ramorum-resting

spores i.e. chlamydospores. The mean Ct for gDNA were within the range of those obtained for infected

241

wood samples (see above) with mean Ct values of 25.45 for gDNA (± 0.055) and 29.05 for cDNA (±0.038)

effect of the heat treatment (F= 72.4, P < 0.0001 and F= 25.2, P < 0.0001 for P. ramorum and G.

248

clavigera, respectively) and an interaction between treatment and time point at which the gDNA and

249

mRNA samples were collected (F= 4.2, P < 0.001 for P. ramorum and F= 2.7, P < 0.01 for G. clavigera)

250

(Table 1). This likely resulted from the difference in cDNA detection as for both species gDNA was

251

amplified after each treatment with Ct values similar or higher than those obtained with the no-

252

treatment control (e.g. Ct distribution ranging from 24.0 to 34.0 for the two heat treatments versus 24.0

253

for the controls; Fig. 4A, B, E and F). For both pathogens, no cDNA was detected at the end of SPF kiln-

254

drying schedule treatment (Ct value equal or above 40.0; Fig. 4D and H), suggesting that this treatment

255

killed efficiently the two pathogens. In contrast, the short heat treatment of 70oC for 1 hour seemed to

256

be less efficient, with clear evidence that the mRNA degraded at different rates for the two organisms

257

following treatment. For P. ramorum, cDNA of the targeted gene (PH178) was detected after up to 24

258

hours post-treatment (mean Ct = 35.8 ±4.82 for 0 to 24 hours post-treatment; Fig. 4C). Similarly, G.

259

clavigera cDNA of gene MS359 was still detected until 96 hours after the short heat treatment (mean Ct

260

= 34.2 ±3.75), suggesting incomplete degradation of mRNA and/or non-lethality of this treatment during

261

this time (Fig. 4G).

Samples were collected at eight time points (0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 168 and 240 hrs) following

Small samples of mycelia were collected at time point zero just after each heat treatment and

276

DISCUSSION

277

Real-time PCR is increasingly becoming the method of choice for molecular detection of

278

microorganisms. Conventional methods used for assessing the efficacy of treatment of wood products

279

typically involve culturing the microorganisms. These methods have the advantage of simultaneously

280

assessing the presence of microorganisms and their viability, but require days from initiation to result

281

and can produce a high rate of false negatives. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the

282

feasibility of developing a molecular method for assessing the presence and viability of wood-colonizing

283

pathogens. Using real-time PCR with TaqMan probes that overlap the exon-intron and exon-exon

284

junctions, it was possible to differentiate between the mRNA and the corresponding genomic gene copy

285

(gDNA). This allowed to compare the kinetics of degradation of both molecules following heat

286

treatments of wood and provided a measure of the presence and absence of microorganisms as well as

287

an assessment of their viability.

288

Being able to accurately detect invasive and regulated pathogen is a hallmark of efficient

289

prevention and integrated pest management programs [41,42]. In some instance assessing viability of

290

the pathogen may even be more crucial. This is particularly relevant in the context of plants, plant parts

291

and wood-material trade between countries [1–3]. RNA-based molecular assays have proven to be

292

successful in detecting a number of different pathogens and assess their viability. For example, early

293

studies have used levels of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) as a proxy of bacteria viability involved in

294

periprosthetic joint infections [43], human endophthalmitis [44] and clinical infectious diseases [45].

295

Although all these studies reported correlation between rRNA detection signal and cell death, rRNA half-

296

life and inconsistent retention after cell death makes it somewhat less accurate, particularly for short

297

term experimentation [45]. Because of its relatively short half-life, mRNA has been used successfully as a

298

viability indicator for a number of prokaryote [45–47] and eukaryote pathogens [48,49]. Another

299

drawback of rRNA for assessing cell viability is that it does not have spliced introns and therefore it

300

cannot be used to differentiate between RNA and gDNA templates, raising the possibility of false

301

positive amplification from accidental gDNA contamination. In this case, a complete elimination of DNA

302

is required prior to performing reverse transcription real-time PCR to ensure reliable use of rRNA as

303

proxy of cell death. As an alternative method to differentiate between RNA and gDNA templates,

304

Menzel et al. designed an end-primer which spans on the exon-exon junction in mRNA, so that efficient

305

primer-annealing and PCR-amplification is only possible after splicing the intron of the targeted gene

306

during the DNA-translation process [50]. Similarly, Leal et al. developed several reverse transcription

307

real time PCR assay to detect living pinewood nematode in wood by targeting the presence of mRNA

308

[18,51]. To comply with international regulations that prevent the movement of pinewood nematode to

309

other countries, these authors showed that their assay could be used in routine for testing commercially

310

manufactured wood-pellets for living pinewood nematode [52].

311

Phytophthora ramorum, the causative agent of the sudden oak death in North-America and

312

sudden larch death in UK, is a regulated pest in North America, Europe and Asia capable to infect over

313

100 different host species and spread into new areas through nursery stock exchange [53]. Accurate and

314

rapid detection methods are crucial for preventing new introductions of this pathogen and several

315

molecular assays have been developed to improve its detection and monitoring [29,54–56].

316

Phytophthora ramorum is also considered as a wood-colonizing pathogen as it can grow in xylem vessels

317

underlying phloem lesions on several woody-perennial species [57,58]. In this context, the ability to

318

assess its viability in plants, plant-parts and in wood-derived products following treatment may be

319

necessary. Chimento et al. developed real-time PCR primers targeting the cytochrome oxidase subunit I

320

(COX1) gene to investigate the viability of P. ramorum mycelial cultures after different treatments [9]. As

321

COX1 is a mitochondrial gene that does not contain introns in Phytophthora spp. [59], their real-time

322

PCR assay does not discriminate the genomic of the transcribed gene copies. In this study the specificity

323

of the assay to detect living P. ramorum was increased by amplifying exclusively cDNA, ruling out

324

potential false positives generated by gDNA contamination of the RNA sample.

325

Our aim was to use our gDNA and mRNA-targeted real-time PCR detection assays to assess the

326

viability of two wood-infecting microorganisms following lethal treatments to test their efficacy. The

327

underlying hypothesis tested was that viability is related to the expression of specific genes. Therefore,

328

monitoring specific P. ramorum and G. clavigera gene transcripts by real-time PCR was expected to

329

provide a simple proxy for viability of these two organisms. The choice of transcript was an important

330

consideration, not only for sensitivity but also for its expression under a variety of conditions. Genes

331

selected to assess viability should be constitutively expressed regardless of the environmental

332

conditions and the micro-organism life-stage as opposed to those induced following a specific

333

environment signal [60]. This ensures that the lack of expression of a constitutive gene is due to the

334

death of the organism instead of the gene being turned “off” by a specific environmental factor.

335

Therefore, in order to develop markers as indicators of cell viability, it was important to identify

336

transcripts that are present and expressed at different stage of the organism’s life cycle and under

337

different environmental conditions. The transcripts retained for this study were chosen based on their

338

putative function related to basic metabolic processes and their high expression levels in transcriptome

339

analyses [30,37,38,40]. In addition, we validated their expression in pure cultures and for mycelium

340

growing in wood-logs. For P. ramorum we successfully conducted the viability assay on chlamydospores,

341

the asexual reproductive structures that are generally involved in long-term survival under adverse

342

conditions, indicating that the targeted gene is still expressed during this life-stage. Although there are

343

no reports of chlamydospores surviving in wood, they could be present in other tissues such as the bark,

344

roots or soil associated with roots or leaves [61].

345

We demonstrated that mRNA Ct detection values (by comparison to gDNA) provide a reliable

346

measure of cell viability after lethal treatment. However, different viability assays may have different

347

abilities to report cell death, which is likely dependent on how the organism is killed and how cell death

348

is defined [47,62,63]. Several studies showed that the ISPM No. 15 guidelines for treatment of wood

349

packaging material [4] were not always lethal for wood-colonizing pathogens. For example, the protocol

350

consisting in exposing the core of the wood for 30 minutes at a temperature of 56 °C was lethal for P.

351

cinnamomi and some other species, but not all the wood colonizing species tested [64]. No mycelial

352

growth was observed for P. ramorum in tanoak disks and boards after a heat treatment of 60oC for at

353

least one hour [65]. However, Chimento et al. demonstrated that a 60°C treatment for one hour did not

354

kill the pathogen but instead delayed its growth [9]. Based on these discrepancies and since most kiln

355

and heat treatments on wood products generate core temperatures exceeding ISPM15 requirements

356

(e.g. for SPF products, drying temperatures are usually in the range of 70°C to 80°C; [66]), we selected a

357

treatment of 70oC applied for a minimum of one hour and the kiln-drying treatment going from 15 to

358

70°C for 7 hours approved as a standard to treat SPF approved by the CFIA [35]. Following these

359

treatments, we used two different methods to assess cell viability. As each of these methods is based on

360

criteria that reflect different levels of cellular integrity or functionality their outcome in declaring cells

361

alive or dead can be different [47,62]. A classical view is to consider that viable cells still have the

362

potential to multiply under suitable condition [47]. This was assessed in our study through a culture-

363

based method. Because of the technical difficulty of re-isolating microorganisms from infected material

17

364

such method comes with a high rate of false negatives [67,68]. In addition, several studies have

365

demonstrated that cells that have lost their “culturability” following a lethal-treatment may still retain

366

some of their physical integrity and functionality [62,69,70]. As a second method, we assumed that the

367

rapid degradation of mRNA might be a useful indicator of cell mortality [47]. However, because mRNA

368

was still detected by reverse transcriptase real-time PCR in P. ramorum and G. clavigera dead cells (as

369

indicated by the non-recovery of living cultures) several hours following a short heat treatment (70°C for

370

a minimum of one hour), we couldn’t conclude that mRNA provided an absolute indicator of viability

371

according to this assumption. Instead, we can consider that the kinetics of mRNA disappearance is

372

related to loss of cell viability: we observed that passed a certain time-point after the heat experiment

373

(i.e. 48 hours for P. ramorum and 168 hours for G. clavigera), mRNA was no longer detected. Non-

374

detection of mRNA just after the SPF kiln-drying schedule treatment supports this hypothesis. Possibly,

375

the longer time of exposure to lethal temperatures in this schedule (7 hours) contributed to achieve full

376

mRNA degradation for that treatment.

377

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) often revises the list of suggested treatments for

378

wood packaging material, emphasizing the importance of reducing the risk of quarantine pests

379

associated with wood exports [4]. The present research acts as a proof-of-concept to enhance future

380

molecular detection methods of invasive and native pathogens of phytosanitary concern. Our

381

mRNA/gDNA detection method differentiated between dead and alive pathogens using reverse

382

transcriptase and real-time PCR assays and was validated in pathogen-infected wood samples. These

383

assays provide a novel way to evaluate and compare the efficacy of wood treatments to eliminate

384

microorganisms that are difficult to detect. Further investigation of the timing and pattern of mRNA

385

degradation in wood and other plant tissues such as leaves and bark should be conducted using this

386

method.
