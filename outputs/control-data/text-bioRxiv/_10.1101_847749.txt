Brain predictors of adolescent substance use

Huntley et al.
Abstract

Neurodevelopmental explanations for adolescent substance use have focused on
heightened sensitivity of the brain’s reward system, centered around the ventral striatum
(VS). Recent evidence demonstrates increased functional connectivity between the VS
and hippocampus in adolescents relative to adults, suggesting that the adolescent brain
may learn from subsequent exposure to risks/rewards. However, a link between VShippocampal circuitry and adolescent substance use has yet to be established. Two
separate longitudinal studies were conducted to evaluate whether variation in VShippocampal resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) predicts subsequent
adolescent substance use. Study 1 consisted of 19 youth recruited from a high
sociodemographic risk population (N = 19; 14 female; 47% Black Non-Hispanic, 32%
White Non-Hispanic). To replicate results of Study 1, Study 2 utilized data from the
National Consortium on Adolescent Neurodevelopment and Alcohol, an ongoing multisite imaging study (N= 644; 339 female; 11% Black Non-Hispanic, 11% Hispanic/Latino,
66% White Non-Hispanic). Resting-state fMRI data were collected at a baseline time
point and lifetime and past year self-reported substance use was collected at a follow up
visit. Regression models tested whether baseline VS-hippocampal rs-FC predicted
substance use at follow up. Across both studies, higher VS-hippocampal rs-FC at
baseline predicted greater substance use at follow up. These data provide the first
evidence linking increased VS-hippocampal connectivity with greater adolescent
substance use. Results fit with the emerging idea that adolescent substance use is
driven by not only a heightened sensitivity to reward, but also a stronger link between
reinforcement learning and episodic memory for rewarding outcomes.

Brain predictors of adolescent substance use

Huntley et al.
Introduction

Experimentation with alcohol, marijuana, and other substances is common among
adolescents (1, 2). However, adolescent substance use is associated with increased risk of
substance use disorders in adulthood, which have a lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in
the US (3). Adolescent substance use has also been linked to later cognitive problems (e.g.,
learning, memory, attention), which may relate to changes in adolescent brain structure and
function (4, 5). Adolescent substance use tends to co-occur with engagement in other health
risk behaviors, including sexual activity, violent behavior, and reckless driving (6). Together, the
consequences of substance use for a substantial number of adolescents are severe, including
lifelong health problems and accidents and unintentional injuries, which represent the leading
cause of death among young people ages 10-24 in the US (7). The enormous public health
costs of adolescent substance use (8, 9) have motivated research into the underlying
neurobiological mechanisms, and to identifying early markers that predict subsequent
engagement.
A propensity for substance use and other risk-taking behavior during adolescence is
thought to arise from heightened sensitivity of the brain’s reward circuitry (10, 11). Prior
neuroimaging studies indicate that key areas of reward circuitry, particularly the ventral striatum
(VS), are more responsive to incentive-based stimuli (e.g., peer approval) in adolescents
relative to both adults and children (12, 13). The VS plays a central role in reward-seeking
behavior and learning, and is a key target of dopaminergic projections from midbrain regions
(14). Given that midbrain dopaminergic systems are involved in reward-seeking and incentive
motivation (15, 16), heightened VS reactivity during adolescence is thought to convey an
increased sensitivity to positive outcomes, even if the behavior is risky (17). In line with this
notion, higher VS reactivity has been shown to correspond with more risky decisions during risk
taking paradigms (18, 19), and with adolescent substance use (20).
Recent evidence suggests that it is not only a heightened neural sensitivity to rewarding

outcomes that drives risk-taking behavior during adolescence, but also an increased ability to
learn from positive reinforcement (21). Recent work by Davidow and colleagues (22)
demonstrated that, relative to adults, adolescents show better reinforcement learning and a
stronger link between reinforcement learning and episodic memory for rewarding outcomes.
This behavioral effect was associated with stronger functional connectivity (FC) between the
striatum and the hippocampus during reward learning, which may reflect greater integration of
reward-related information into long-term memory (22). Together, the VS, hippocampus, and
midbrain form a critical reward-memory loop that signals the motivational significance of events
and modulates episodic memory formation in the hippocampus (23, 24). Connections within VShippocampal circuitry are therefore critically involved in the strengthening of reward-guided
habits, actions, and episodic memory for motivational events, thereby allowing past experiences
to adaptively guide behavior (23, 24). In light of the recent findings of Davidow et al. (22), VShippocampal circuitry may be involved in the propensity for substance use during adolescence.
However, a direct link between VS-hippocampal circuitry and adolescent substance use has yet
to be established.
The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that increased FC between the
VS and hippocampus predicts greater subsequent substance use in adolescence. This
hypothesis is based on the notion that youth who show greater VS-hippocampal FC may be
sensitized to better learn from rewarding experiences and may therefore be more likely to
subsequently apply this learning and engage in substance use (21, 22). Thus, here we examine
the brain as a potential predictor of future behavior. We test this hypothesis first with a
longitudinal imaging study (Study 1) performed in a sample of youth at high sociodemographic
risk for substance use and associated negative outcomes (25) (Detroit, Michigan, USA). We
then performed an independent replication study in a large, publicly available dataset (National
Consortium on Adolescent Neurodevelopment and Alcohol, NCANDA), using longitudinal data
collected in n = 644 US adolescents and young adults (Study 2).

Materials and Methods
Two separate longitudinal studies were conducted (Studies 1 and 2) to examine brain patterns
predicting subsequent substance use during the high-risk period of adolescence. All included
participants had resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at time point
1 (T1) and returned for a subsequent substance use assessment during adolescence (time
point 2, T2).
Participants
Study 1: Nineteen youth, predominantly female (n = 14), participated in this study at Wayne
State University (WSU; see Table-I and Figure-1). The age range for T2 (15-17 years) was
selected to roughly coincide with a large-scale international study (>5,000 individuals) showing
that sensation-seeking increases during adolescence, peaks around age 19, and subsequently
declines into adulthood (26). Self-regulation also increases during adolescence, and reaches a
plateau between the ages of 23 and 26 (26). These observations are congruent with other age
gradients in risk-taking behavior, such as arrests for criminal behavior and substance use (1).
Participants were recruited through advertisements posted on the WSU website, Craigslist
(Detroit, Michigan), printed flyers, or through area behavioral medicine clinics. Exclusionary
criteria included lack of parental involvement, lack of English proficiency, history of brain injury,
neurological or movement disorders, or presence of MRI contraindication.
Consistent with the study location (Detroit, Michigan), the sample was racially and economically
diverse (Table1). Research shows that minority, lower-income populations are at increased risk
for engaging in health risk behaviors during adolescence, and are more likely to suffer from
associated negative consequences (e.g., substance use disorders (27-30)). The follow up visit
(T2) occurred 2-4 years after time point 1 (M = 3.26, SD = 0.75).
Study 2: Study 2 reports on data collected from 644 adolescents and young adults from
NCANDA, a large multi-site study that aims to examine the neurocognitive correlates of alcohol
use in a nationally representative (sex and racial/ethnic groups) sample of US adolescents (31).

Brain predictors of adolescent substance use

Huntley et al.

To replicate results of Study 1, we included participants with resting-state fMRI data collected at
T1 and who reported on substance use at the 1-year follow up visit (T2; see Figure-1C; 1 ± .12
years between visits). To identify predictors of future substance use risk, youth were recruited
for the NCANDA study for limited substance use at T1 but oversampled youth at high risk (e.g.,
family history of substance use disorder). NCANDA participants were recruited across five sites:
Duke University, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Oregon Health & Science University,
University of California, San Diego, and SRI International. Exclusionary criteria included lack of
parental involvement, lack of English proficiency, psychotropic medication use, early
developmental problems, psychiatric disorders, pervasive developmental disorder, or MRI
contraindications (see (31) for full list). Similar to Study 1, the Study 2 sample was racially and
economically diverse (Table 1).
Both studies: All participants provided written informed/parental informed consent and child or
adolescent assent prior to participation. Study procedures were approved by the local IRB and
have been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964
Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. For both studies, a Certificate of
Confidentiality issued by the US Department of Health and Human Services was obtained to
help further protect the privacy of participants in disclosing substance use.
Substance use
Adolescent self-report of lifetime and past year substance use was evaluated at T2 using a
summary score, by dichotomizing responses for engagement in various substance use
categories (alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, amphetamines, narcotics, sedatives, hallucinogens,
cocaine, inhalants, opiates, illicit use of prescription drugs). In particular, those who indicated “0
occasions” were coded as not using this substance and those who reported any occasions were
coded as using this substance. Of note, the number of substance use categories tried was
positively correlated with the number of episodes of alcohol or drug intoxication (r = .48, p <

.001). Neuroimaging results for number of episodes were consistent with reported results. See
Supplemental Material for further information.
Imaging acquisition and preprocessing
See Supplemental Material for details on collection of resting-state fMRI data and approaches to
reduce the potential impact of head motion on results. FC pre-processing and group-level
analyses were conducted using identical procedures across both studies. In brief, fMRI
preprocessing was conducted using SPM8 software (Statistical Parametric Mapping;
http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) and included slice-timing correction, realignment, spatial
normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, and smoothing using a 6mm Gaussian kernel.
VS seed-based resting-state functional connectivity analysis
Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) was measured using a seed-based approach. Left
and right VS seeds were defined as spherical regions of interest (ROIs; 4-mm radii; 33 voxels)
centered at x = ±10, y = 14, z = 0, following a previous rs-FC study in youth (32). Rs-FC of left
and right VS seeds with the rest of the brain was determined using Pearson bivariate correlation
with the CONN Toolbox (ver.12.p; www.nitrc.org/projects/conn). Resulting correlation values
were normalized using Fisher z-transformation.
Group-level VS rs-FC analysis
Study 1 and Study 2 were analyzed separately. First, to establish the basic network topology
and compare this to previous research, we evaluated rs-FC of left and right VS across each
sample, using one-sample t-tests in SPM8. A liberal threshold of p < .005, 10-voxel minimum
was used to visualize network topology, and areas surviving whole brain cluster-level correction
(Study 1: p < .001, 118-voxel minimum; Study 2: p < .001, 550-voxel minimum) are indicated in
Tables-S2 and S3. The whole brain threshold was determined by computing the spatial
autocorrelation of the data via AFNI’s 3dFWHMx and subsequently performing Monte Carlo
simulations (10,000 iterations) using 3dClustSim (compile date July 22, 2016; National Institute

of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD; https://afni.nimh.nih.gov). Our main analysis tested whether
VS-hippocampus connectivity at T1 predicted substance use reported at T2, using a regression
analysis in SPM8, with lifetime number of substances tried as the variable of interest and age at
T1 as a variable of no interest. Additionally, given the variability in length of time between visits
in Study 1, months between T1 and T2 were included as an additional variable of no interest in
Study 1 analyses. We performed follow-up analyses to test whether lifetime number of
substances tried at T1 also predicted VS-hippocampal connectivity at T1 (Study 2 only;
substance use data unavailable for T1 in Study 1). Results were considered significant within an
a priori hippocampus ROI, based on Davidow et al.(22) (x = -16, y = -8, z = -20, 12-mm radius
sphere), using small-volume familywise error correction, pFWE ≤ .05. A functional ROI was
created around peak effects from Study 1 for use in Study 2 (6-mm radius sphere). A
complementary whole brain analysis was performed, and effects were considered significant at
the whole brain corrected threshold (see above). All coordinates provided in this report are
given in MNI convention. Given evidence of positive skew in substance use scores, we
confirmed that results reported did not change when applying a square root transformation,
which resulted in a more normal distribution. Observed results remained significant when using
the transformed variable.
Results
Substance use across Study 1 and 2 samples
42% and 48% of participants in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively endorsed lifetime use of at
least one substance at T2, with alcohol, marijuana, and cigarettes being the most common (see
Table-II for summary of lifetime and past year use). Lifetime and past year substance use was
highly interrelated across both studies (rs >.9, ps < .001). Across both studies, older youth
reported more substance use than younger youth (Study 1: r = .5, p = .03; Study 2: r = .45, p <
.001; see Figure-1b and 1d, respectively). Overall, these patterns are consistent with previous
reports (1, 2)

VS rs-FC across Study 1 and 2 samples
Similar patterns of left and right VS rs-FC were observed across both samples (Figure 2 and
Tables S2-S3), with positive connectivity observed across regions of the orbitofrontal cortex,
medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus), medial frontal regions, insula, thalamus, and
basal ganglia. Overall, these patterns are similar to those observed in a previous study of VS rsFC in youth (32).
VS-hippocampal connectivity is associated with later substance use
Study 1: A priori ROI analyses showed that higher right VS rs-FC with the left hippocampus
(pFWE = .041, Z = 3.59, x = -20, y = -18, z = -24, 28 voxels) at T1 was associated with more
substance use at T2 (Figure 3). There were no significant effects of substance use with left VS
or right hippocampus. Analyses repeated with the addition of motion despiking were consistent
with these results (pFWE = .023, Z = 3.91, x = -20, y = -18, z = -24, 32 voxels).
Study 2: Consistent with results of Study 1, higher right VS rs-FC with the left hippocampus
(pFWE = .048, Z = 2.63, x = -22, y = -16, z = -20, 7 voxels) at T1 was associated with more
substance use at T2 (Figure 3). There were no significant effects of substance use with left VS
or right hippocampus. Analyses repeated with the addition of motion despiking were consistent
with these results (pFWE = .05, Z = 2.61, x = -22, y = -16, z = -1, 6 voxels). Importantly, there
was no association between lifetime substance use reported at T1 and VS-hippocampal rs-FC
at T1.
Whole brain results
Study 1: Whole brain analyses indicated one region spanning fusiform gyrus, cerebellum, and
inferior occipital lobe (x = 24, y = -66, z = -20, Z = 3.89, 135 voxels; Figure S1) showing lower
connectivity with left VS in youth who reported higher substance use. No other areas were
significant at the corrected whole brain threshold.
Study 2: No areas reached significance at the corrected whole brain threshold.

Discussion

Important recent work by Davidow and colleagues (22) demonstrated increased VShippocampal connectivity in adolescents relative to adults, which corresponded with stronger
integration of reward-related reinforcement learning into long-term memory. These results
provide new evidence that the increased propensity towards substance use in adolescence may
be driven not only by a heightened neural sensitivity to reward– the focus of much contemporary
research– but also an increased sensitivity to encode reward-based behavior or cues into longterm memory. However, a direct link between VS-hippocampal circuitry and engagement in
substance use was not tested in that study. The present study used two independent samples
to identify associations between VS-hippocampal connectivity and substance use during
adolescence. Across both studies, we found that increased rs-FC within VS-hippocampal
circuitry longitudinally predicted a greater number of substances that adolescents reported
using.
The VS, hippocampus, and also midbrain regions are key components of a
dopaminergic circuitry that signals motivationally important events and modulates the formation
of long-term memory for those events (33). These regions form a critical functional loop that
provides top-down signals of novelty (arising from the hippocampus) and contributes to the
bottom-up formation of long-term memory in the hippocampus. In particular, detection of novel
or motivationally salient stimuli (via hippocampus) leads to increased activation of the VS and
midbrain regions. Activation of these regions, in turn, causes a release of dopamine and serves
to enhance long-term potentiation in the hippocampus (24). Results of Studies 1 and 2 indicate
increased integration within VS-hippocampal circuitry in youth subsequently reporting more
substance use. These findings provide support for the notion that substance use during
adolescence may be driven by dopaminergic sensitivity to motivationally-relevant cues, and/or
how strongly these cues imprint into memory. Although this hypothesis should be tested in
future research, increased neural connectivity within this core dopaminergic circuitry may reflect

a sensitivity such that reward-based behavior or cues are more strongly encoded, and thus,
more likely to guide later choices. Higher VS-hippocampal rs-FC during the transition from
childhood and adolescence may serve as a marker for increased health risk behavior during
adolescence. Together with other critical risk factors (e.g., peers, family factors, genetic
background), a neural marker could be of great service for designing neurodevelopmentallyinformed early interventions.
Interestingly, VS-hippocampal rs-FC at T1 was associated with substance use reported
at T2 (but not T1). This suggests that strength of integration within VS-hippocampal circuitry
predicts a tendency to engage in future (but not current) substance use, or the association
between substance use and VS-hippocampal circuitry strengthens over time. Indeed, substance
experimentation tends to follow a developmental trajectory such that engagement in substance
use and other risk behaviors increases rapidly from early-to-mid adolescence, and peaks during
mid-to-late adolescence (1, 2, 34).
Across both studies, the included samples were both racially and economically diverse
and included a large number of minority adolescents residing in lower income households
(Table 1). Research shows urban, minority, and lower-socioeconomic populations are at
heightened risk for engaging in health risk behaviors during adolescence, and are more likely to
suffer from associated negative consequences (27-30). Understanding risk pathways is thus
especially important in high-risk populations, and requires inclusion of more understudied
populations in medical (35) and neuroscientific research (36).
Limitations
Based on prior work by Davidow et al. (22), we took a hypothesis-driven approach and
focused on VS-hippocampal circuitry. This approach reduces the potential for spurious findings
and limits our focus on dopaminergic circuitry that is known to be critical for reward-driven
behavior and memory integration. However, it does not preclude the potential role of other brain
regions and connections that may predict later substance use. While our complementary whole

brain analyses in Study 1 linked substance use to altered VS connectivity with a region
spanning the fusiform gyrus, cerebellum, and inferior occipital lobe, this result did not replicate
in Study 2. Future studies should evaluate other brain regions and larger-scale networks (e.g.,
salience network). Next, substance use was assessed using adolescent self-report. Although
the measure shows good reliability and construct validity (see Methods), future studies should
consider the additional evaluation of an objective measure of adolescent substance use (e.g.,
hair samples) or related health risk behaviors (e.g., risky driving fMRI task (37)). Furthermore,
we measured VS connectivity during resting-state, and therefore patterns observed here may
not be consistent with those observed during reward processing or a risk-taking task. However,
recent research suggests that patterns observed in the resting-state predict individual
differences during behavioral tasks (38). Nevertheless, it will be important to test whether VShippocampal connectivity is similarly increased during a risk-taking task as an additional test of
the hypothesis. Similarly, our interpretation of these rs-FC data assume a functional process
that is previously described in the extant literature (e.g., 24), and is a limitation of the current
work. We cannot confirm that the FC observed in these studies is directly related to risk/reward
behavior, and future work should incorporate cognitive tasks that engage risk/reward processes
to further evaluate our interpretations of VS-hippocampal rs-FC.
Conclusion
Many health risk behaviors are established during adolescence and frequently
maintained into adulthood, influencing lifelong health and wellbeing. Research into
neurobiological drivers or predictors of future engagement in substance use and other risk
behaviors during adolescence may help to reduce this health burden by informing intervention
strategies and governmental policies. Recent research into the neurobiological origins of
substance use during adolescence suggests that the adolescent brain is not only more sensitive
to reward, but also more sensitive to reinforcement than the adult brain, which may be reflected
in the observed increased connectivity between the VS and hippocampus (22). The present

subsequently greater substance use during adolescence. These findings prompt further
investigation into role of dopamine-rich VS-hippocampal circuitry in susceptibility to adolescent
substance use, and as potential markers for identifying at-risk youth.

Figure 1. Age at baseline (T1) and follow up (T2) visits, and substance use endorsed at
T2, by age, for Study 1 (top) and Study 2 (bottom). MRI scanning occurred at T1. The
substance use survey occurred at T2 (and also T1 for Study 2). Abbreviations: T1, Time 1; T2,
Time 2; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging. See also Tables 1 and 2.
Figure 2. Overall resting-state functional connectivity of left and right VS for Studies 1
(a,b) and 2 (c,d). Left and right VS seed regions of interest are defined based on Porter et al.
(32) Connectivity maps shown at the corrected whole-brain threshold (Study 1: p < .001, 118voxel minimum; Study 2: p < .001, 550-voxel minimum). Abbreviations: VS, ventral striatum.
Connectivity values are given as Fisher’s z-transformed Pearson’s correlations.
Figure 3. Higher VS functional connectivity with the hippocampus is subsequently
associated with a greater number of substances tried during adolescence. Results
significant at a small-volume familywise error-corrected threshold of pFWE < .05, displayed at p
< .005 masked in anatomical hippocampus (AAL atlas). Right: Rs-FC values (Fisher’s Ztransformed Pearson’s correlations) were extracted for each participant from group peaks in
hippocampus and plotted by substance use for display purposes only. Abbreviations: VS,
ventral striatum; rs-FC, resting-state functional connectivity.
