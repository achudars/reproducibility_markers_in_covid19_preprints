Summary
Cell size homeostasis is often achieved by coupling cell cycle progression to cell growth.
Studies of cell size homeostasis in single-celled bacteria and yeast have observed several
distinct phenomena. Growth can be coupled to division through a range of mechanisms,
including a ‘sizer’, wherein cells of varying birth size divide at similar final sizes [1-3], and an
‘adder’, wherein cells increase in size a fixed amount per cell cycle [4-6]. Importantly,
intermediate control mechanisms are observed, and even the same organism can exhibit
distinct control phenomena depending on growth conditions [2,7,8]. While studying unicellular
organisms in laboratory conditions may give insight into their growth control in the wild, this is
less apparent for studies of mammalian cells growing outside the organism. Sizer, adder, and
intermediate mechanisms have been observed in vitro [9-12], but it is unclear how these diverse
size homeostasis phenomena relate to mammalian cell proliferation in vivo. To address this gap,
we analyzed time-lapse images of the mouse epidermis taken over one week during normal
tissue turnover [13]. We quantified the 3D volume growth and cell cycle progression of single
cells within the mouse skin. In dividing epidermal stem cells, we found that cell growth is
coupled to division through a sizer mechanism operating largely in the G1 phase. Thus, while
the majority of tissue culture studies to-date identified adder mechanisms, our analysis
demonstrates that sizer mechanisms are important in vivo and highlights the need to determine
their underlying molecular origin.

Results
Measuring cell volume growth in epidermal stem cells during normal tissue turnover
To determine which cell size homeostasis mechanism operates in vivo, we examined epidermal
stem cells growing and dividing during normal tissue turnover. Mouse skin is an ideal system to
study in vivo cell size control because it has a high frequency of cell divisions in healthy adults
[14]. The epidermis is a multilayered epithelium with suprabasal layers of differentiated
keratinocytes residing above a basal layer of stem cells (Figure 1A). The basal layer epidermal
stem cells are the only source of new cells during normal tissue turnover [15]. As they
proliferate, epidermal stem cells can either self-renew and remain in the basal layer or
differentiate into the suprabasal layers, where they eventually shed.
To measure cell growth and division in vivo, we analyzed images previously acquired by Mesa,
Kawaguchi, and Cockburn, et al. (2018) [13]. Skin regions on the mouse hindpaw were microtattooed, which served as fiducial marks allowing re-visiting of the same regions over time
(Figure 1B). Cells in the same region were imaged with two-photon microscopy every 12 hours
for up to 7 days (Figure 1C). Since mice were not wounded during the experiment and were
allowed to return to normal activity between imaging, these movies capture stem cell growth
dynamics during unperturbed tissue turnover.
To quantify cell volume, we reconstructed 3D cell shapes by manually segmenting movies from
mice expressing Histone-2B-Cerulean (nuclear reporter), Actin-GFP (cortex reporter), and
FUCCI-G1 mKO2-hCdt1(30/120) (G1 reporter) (Figure 1D-E, Supplemental Figure S1). We
could track cells over an entire cell cycle and use the FUCCI-G1 reporter to distinguish G1 from
S/G2/M phases. We restricted our analysis to dividing stem cells within the basal layer. Similar
4D reconstruction strategies have been used to quantify in vivo epithelial cell volume and shape
change in Drosophila and Arabidopsis [16,17].
We measured cell volume growth over entire cell cycles for 197 cells from 3 independent tissue
regions in 2 different mice (Figure 2A, Supplemental Figure S2A-C; Movie S1-2). Cells on
average cycled every 71 ± 21h (std), with the majority of time spent in G1 phase (Figure 2B-D).
This estimate is consistent with independent estimates of hindpaw epidermis cell cycle
durations [18]. Notably, cell cycles in vivo are much longer than cell cycles in vitro, where cell
lines typically divide once a day. To assess the error in our 3D segmentation, we fitted our data
to smoothing splines, since cell volume is expected to increase gradually over time
(Supplemental Figure S3A-F). Over 90% of fitting residuals for our spline fits are smaller than
50µm3 in magnitude, and the average residual is <10% of the estimated volume signal
(Supplemental Figure S3G-H). We also tested the intra-user variability in 3D segmentation by
performing independent repeat measurements and found that the average intra-user error is
similar in magnitude (9.1± 8.6%, std) (Supplemental Figure S3I-J). Next, we compared the
volume growth curves with cross-sectional area growth curves, a common cell size proxy in
epithelial cells (Supplemental Figure S4A-B). Area growth curves, while correlated with
volume growth (Supplemental Figure S4C), are significantly noisier with larger relative
residuals when fit to smoothing splines (Supplemental Figure S4D). These analyses suggest
that our volume growth data have low error and better reflect cell size than cross-sectional cell
area measurements. To reduce error in subsequent analyses, we present spline-smoothed data
in the main text. Similar analyses on raw data yielded qualitatively similar conclusions and are
shown in the supplemental figures.

Nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio remains constant throughout the cell cycle
Nuclear volume has been shown to be proportional to cell volume (constant N:C ratio) in
different cell lines. While the N:C ratio may vary across cells of different types and/or species,
within the same cell type it is typically independent of cell size and cell cycle phase [19]. To test
if this remains true in vivo, we quantified nuclear volume by segmenting the nucleus using
labeled histone H2B-Cerulean (Supplemental Figure S5). We observed that nuclear volume
grows during cell growth, and that the N:C ratio remains relatively constant throughout both G1
and S/G2 phases (Figure 2E-G; Supplemental Figure S6A-B). In bivariate regression analysis
using cell volume or cell phase to predict nuclear volume, cell volume is a clearly significant
predictor (P < 10-10) while cell phase is not (P > 0.05). Thus, the N:C ratio remains relatively
constant throughout the cell cycle in vivo.
Cells grow faster than linearly in vivo
Next, we examined the volume growth dynamics of epidermal stem cells in vivo. Currently, there
is conflicting evidence for how mammalian cells grow. In vitro, cells have been reported to grow
linearly (accumulating a constant amount of volume per unit time), exponentially (accumulating
volume in proportion to their current volume), or with intermediate dynamics [10,12,20-22].
However, there is no comparable data in mammalian tissues in vivo, where single-cell growth
rates are especially difficult to measure. We quantified the absolute growth rate as a function of
cell volume by taking the difference in cell volume between one time-point and its previous timepoint, normalized by the framerate. Stem cells grow faster the larger they become, leading to
supra-linear growth (Figure 2H). Supporting this, volume growth curves better fit exponential
compared to linear models (Supplemental Figure S3G). This supra-linear relation is also
present in the raw data (Supplemental Figure S6C). Furthermore, there is little difference in
growth rates between G1 and S/G2/M cells of the same size. In bivariate regression analysis
where cell volume and cell cycle phase were used to predict growth rate, cell volume is a
significant predictor (P < 10-10), whereas cell cycle phase is not (P > 0.9). Similarly, if we break
G1 into early G1 (first 3 frames) and the rest of G1, cell volume significantly predicts growth rate
in G1 (P < 10-10) while early or late G1 phase does not (P > 0.9). Taken together, these results
suggest that size rather than cell cycle phase is the dominant factor determining cell growth
rate. In both G1 and S/G2/M phases, growth dynamics is faster than linear.
Estimating the final cell division size
Since cells grow faster when they are larger, we hypothesized that the 12h sampling rate may
lead to a significant underestimation of the final division size of the cell if we take the division
size at the final frame before daughter cells appear. We therefore estimated division size by
averaging the size at the last frame with the sum of the sizes of the daughter cells in the
subsequent frame (Supplemental Figure S7A-C). Stem cell divisions result in daughters of
high symmetry (Supplemental Figure S7D). We observed that the interpolated division size is
on average 35 ± 57 µm3 (std) larger than the sampled final size before division (Supplemental
Figure S7E-F). Importantly, the interpolated volume is likely a better estimate of the division
volume because it is closer to twice the average birth volume (1.9-fold vs 2.0-fold; P < 10-13,
one-sided paired T-test) (Figure 2I; Supplemental Figure S7G).
Evidence for swelling during mitosis
Recent studies showed that cells in vitro rapidly swell up to 20% in volume when entering
mitosis, and this swelling is quickly lost during anaphase [23,24]. This osmotically-driven
swelling allows cells to push away their neighbors and achieve a spherical geometry during
mitosis, which is thought to support spindle formation and accurate chromosome segregation

[25]. Interestingly, we have 11 growth curves where the final frame before division captured
cells in mitosis as evident in their spherical shape and loss of nuclear envelope (Supplemental
Figure S7H). Consistent with the mitotic swelling model, we found that the volume of mitotic
cells is larger than the sum of the two daughter volumes following division (Supplemental
Figure S7I).
G1 and S/G2/M durations adjust to birth size variation
To determine how cell size is controlled in epidermal stem cells, we first examined the
relationship between cell size and cell cycle phase durations. Cells born smaller are much more
likely to spend longer in G1, suggesting that the G1/S transition is important for cell size control
(Figure 3A; R = -0.54, P < 10-15). Cells born in the smallest size bin (233-291 µm3) on average
spend 70h ± 19 (std) in G1, whereas cells born in the largest bin (398-496 µm3) spend 40h ± 13
in G1. We note that cells exiting G1 with smaller volumes also spend on average longer in
S/G2/M (Figure 3B; R = -0.47, P < 10-10). Cells exiting G1 in the smallest size bin (290-432
µm3) spend 20h ± 12 in S/G2/M, while cells exiting G1 in the largest size bin (530-671 µm3)
spend 11h ± 4 in S/G2/M. However, there is poor sampling of the S/G2/M phases which only
last 1-2 movie frames (Figure 2C). This low sampling may introduce artifacts in the S/G2/M
correlations (see Discussion; Supplemental Figure S8). Notably, the coefficient of variation
(CV) of the G1 exit volume is smaller than the CV of cell size at birth or at cell division
(Supplementary Figure S9; P < 0.05, bootstrap test). Taken together, these data suggest that
there may be size control occurring at the G1/S transition.
Epidermal stem cells grow as sizers
That smaller cells spend more time in G1 phase suggested that they would be able to
compensate for their small initial size by growing more during their cell cycle. If the G1/S
transition were a ‘sizer’, the linear regression slope (m) between birth size and G1 exit size
would be m = 0. Conversely, if G1/S were an adder, then the slope would be m = 1 (Figure 3C).
We find that for epidermal stem cells, the slope of the linear regression between birth volume
and G1 exit volume is m = 0.21 ± 0.15 (95% confidence interval), indicating a near-sizer
mechanism coupling cell birth size to G1 exit (Figure 3D). During S/G2/M, the correlation
between G1 exit volume and growth during S/G2/M is intermediate between a sizer and adder
with m = 0.61 ± 0.18 (Figure 3E). Over the entire cell cycle, the slope between birth volume and
division volume is m = 0.06 ± 0.23, which corresponds to an almost perfect sizer (Figure 3F).
The same data can be replotted to view the inverse correlation between cell size and the
amount grown in a specific cell cycle phase or over the entire cell cycle (Figure 3G-I). Similar
trends can be seen in the unsmoothed and uninterpolated data (Supplemental Figure S10).
Cell size predicts timing of G1 exit
Since cell growth during G1 exhibits a near-sizer, we sought to quantify which factors most
affect the rate of G1/S progression. We performed multiple-logistic regression using cell size,
cell age, and growth rate as predictors of the timing of G1 exit. We found that both cell size (P <
10-10) and cell age (P < 10-5) were significant factors, while growth rate was not (P > 0.05).
Logistic regression with cell volume yields a sharp separation between G1 and S phase cells
(Figure 4A), while logistic regression with cell age yields a much shallower slope (Figure 4B).
We quantified the accuracy of using cell volume, cell age, or both to predict G1 exit, by
calculating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for all three sets of predictors
(Figure 4C). We found that ROC curves obtained from using cell volume or using both cell
volume and cell age were nearly identical, with the area under the ROC curve being 0.93 for
using cell volume alone and 0.94 when using both cell volume and age. This indicates that while

cell age is statistically significant, it is a small factor relative to cell volume in determining the
timing G1 exit.

Discussion
Keeping cell size homeostasis during proliferation is crucial for maintaining optimal cell
physiology, and may be important for proper tissue geometry and function [26-31]. One way that
cell size can be controlled is by coupling cell cycle progression to cell growth through a sizer, in
which growth over a single cycle compensates for variation in birth size. This way, all cells reach
a similar size at division. However, adders, where cells grow a constant amount over a single
cycle independent of birth size, more closely approximate the size control exhibited by a variety
of animal cell lines grown in vitro [9,10,27,32]. Here, in contrast to expectations from in vitro
studies, we show that mouse epidermal stem cells exhibit an overall sizer in vivo, and variation
in cell birth size is compensated for within one cell cycle. Most of this compensation takes place
in the G1 phase, but there may also be some compensation during the remainder of the cell
cycle (Figure 4D). To our knowledge, this work is the first study examining how cell size control
is operating in a mammalian tissue in vivo. Furthermore, our work highlights that cell birth size is
an important factor in determining the timing of stem cell division.
Our analysis of the growth and division of adult epithelial stem cells in vivo has several
implications for similar in vitro studies. First, the observation of a sizer in vivo implies that
researchers working on epithelial cells should focus on lines that exhibit a similar sizer
phenomenon rather than the wide range of cell lines that do not. Second, there is a dramatic
difference between the duration of cell cycle phases in vitro and in vivo. While the S/G2/M
phase of the cell cycle is similar in duration in vitro and in vivo at ~12 hours, the G1 phase
extends 5-fold from ~10 hours in vitro to ~50 hours in vivo. G1 also accounts for ~50% of total in
vivo growth (Supplemental Figure S11), while in vitro it is only about ~25% [10,12]. Thus, G1
growth and size control is more important in vivo than in vitro. The G1 sizer we observed may
be related to the small size of skin stem cells when they are born (~350 µm3 vs ~1500 µm3 for a
HeLa cell) [10]. Fission yeast born with average or smaller size exhibit a sizer, whereas largerborn fission yeast exhibit an adder [2]. Similarly, only small rat basophilic leukemia cells exhibit
a sizer [11]. The smallness of stem cells maybe why they exhibit such strong sizer behavior. An
alternative explanation for why we observe a sizer in vivo but an adder in vitro is that cells grow
more slowly in vivo, with average G1 growth rate being ~5 µm3 hr-1 in vivo compared to ~80 µm3
hr-1 for HeLa cells in vitro [10]. A 3-fold change in growth rate clearly impacts size control in E.
coli, which exhibit an adder when growing quickly but a sizer when growing more slowly [7,33].
Finally, we note that we have only analyzed skin stem cells and other cell types could have
different size control mechanisms in vivo.
While our work definitively identifies a G1 sizer in vivo, it gives us limited information about the
underlying regulatory network. Yeast cells employ the same G1 regulatory network to produce
sizers for small-born cells and adders for large-born cells [2,8,34]. This is similarly found in rat
leukemia cells [11]. We expect that either of the currently proposed G1 control mechanisms, Rb
dilution or p38 activation [35,36], could theoretically yield sizers or adders depending on
parameter values. In addition, an important experimental limitation is the 12h sampling
frequency. This low sampling frequency precludes a more careful analysis of growth during
S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle. To quantify the effect of poor temporal sampling, we analyzed

data produced by [12] of the cell size growth and cell cycle progression of human mammary
epithelial cells (HMECs) growing in vitro (Supplemental Figure S8A-B). While we saw that size
control correlations in G1 were largely unaffected by the low sampling rate, the same was not
true for the shorter S/G2/M phases (Supplemental Figure S8C-F). By down-sampling the
HMEC dataset to have successively poorer sampling of S/G2/M phases, we observed that a
spurious negative correlation between size at G1/S and S/G2/M duration emerges as a result of
low temporal sampling, suggesting uncertainty in our estimation of S/G2/M dynamics
(Supplemental Figure S8G). Additionally, the low sampling frequency prevents accurate
estimation of the growth function, i.e., how rapidly cells grow as a function of their size or cell
cycle position. At this point, we can conclude that cell growth is not linear, meaning that cells are
not increasing their size at a constant rate through the cell cycle. Rather, larger cells are
growing faster than smaller cells, and this relationship between size and growth rate is similar in
G1 and S/G2/M cells. However, higher temporal resolution is required to more precisely
determine the cell growth function and its relationship to exponential growth (where the cell
growth rate is directly proportional to cell size), which has implications for cell size control
[9,21,22,37].
We have here analyzed cell growth and division at the level of single cells and neglected
potential contributions related to tissue geography. In multicellular tissues, cells experience
complex chemical or mechanical feedback from neighboring cells and are regulated by
pathways controlling organ size. Certainly, regardless of these multicellular considerations, our
observation of a G1 sizer mechanism is inconsistent with a previous model, in which cell growth
proceeds linearly while division timing occurs at a constant frequency [20], because cell growth
in G1 is clearly coupled to the timing of the G1/S transition. This is also observed in a similar
single cell analysis of in vivo cell division in the Arabidopsis meristem, although the plant stem
cells exhibited control mechanism intermediate between sizer and adder [17].
An important open question is how cell autonomous size control is integrated in the context of a
multicellular organ. One attractive model is that total cellular growth within a tissue is
determined by organ size control mechanisms, and cell size control mechanisms operate at the
cell level to quantize that total growth into individual cells. Specifically for the epidermis, local
changes in cell density lead to stem cell growth as shown by [13], and this growth is then
coordinated with cell division by a size-dependent G1/S transition. This model is consistent with
the corpus of studies showing that mutations affecting G1/S control have generally little effect
on organ size, but impact cell size and number within the organ [38-40]. Certainly, we anticipate
it will be exciting to see if and how specific cell-autonomous size control mechanisms interact
with organ size control pathways.

Methods
Mice and in vivo imaging
All movies used in this study were previously published [13]. Briefly, cells from non-hairy plantar
skin were imaged with two-photon microscopy every 12h for 4 to 7 days. Regions were revisited in independent imaging sessions using micro-tattoo fiducial marks for orientation and
intrinsic idiosyncratic features of each skin region for alignment. In between imaging time-points,
mice were returned to normal activity. Three datasets used in this study were of mice
expressing CMV-mKO2-hCdt1(30/120) [41], K14-actin-GFP [42], and K14-H2B-Cerulean [13],

where K14 is the human K14 promoter expressed only within the keratinocyte lineage. Two
regions were used from Mouse 1, which was imaged for 7 days (168 h). A third region from
Mouse 2 was imaged for 4 days (96 h). Data acquired from both animals were similar
(Supplemental Figure S2), although the shorter movie duration in Mouse 2 limited our
sampling of longer cell cycles in Region 3.
Cell volume reconstruction and cell cycle annotation
All cell volumes were manually segmented in FIJI using PolygonRois [43]. Automatically tracked
lineages from Mesa, Kawaguchi, & Cockburn, et al. (2018) were filtered for cells that are born
and divide within the duration of the movie [13]. A custom FIJI applet was built to display
automatically tracked cell centroids on the movie to facilitate manual segmentation. Mistakes
made by the automatic tracking were fixed manually. Cell volume was calculated by summing
the cell area throughout all z-slices and multiplying by the z-step size. Custom Jpython scripts
were used to automate ROI measurement and export in FIJI. Repeated volume reconstructions
were made to quantify intra-user variation in segmentation. Repeat growth curves were
generated for 8 cells (N = 48 time-points) chosen at random and the agreement between the
original and the repeat measurements were quantified (Supplemental Figure 3I-J). Daughter
cell volumes were quantified in the same way as mother cell volumes. Cells whose daughter
volumes could not be estimated were excluded from the analysis involving interpolated division
volumes (N = 30). For comparison of cell volume to cross-sectional cell area, the z-position of
the cross-section was determined by [13] to be the z-position corresponding to the largest
projected nuclear area.
Cell cycle transitions were annotated manually based on the fluorescent FUCCI-G1 reporter
mKO2-hCdt1(30/120). Because the illumination was not constant throughout the movie, the total
intensity of the G1 reporter was not comparable across time-points. Therefore, the G1 exit
frame was annotated as the frame at which the G1 reporter within the cell nucleus became
indistinguishable from the local background (Supplemental Figure S1). The FUCCI-G1
reporter also had variable expression in the basal layer cells so that a subset of cells never had
visible expression throughout their cell cycle. These cells were excluded from the analysis.
Mitotic cells were manually identified by their rounded cell shapes and visible nuclear envelope
breakdown (Supplemental Figure S7H). The fidelity of the segmentation and tracking was
assessed by examining the 3D segmentation overlaid on the original movie images
(Supplemental Movie S1-2).
Volume growth analysis
Cell volume growth curves and cell cycle annotations were collated in Python using pandas [44].
We fitted cell volume growth curves to smoothing cubic splines using numpy and scipy [45,46].
A high smoothing factor (105) was used to ensure relatively stiff spline fits (Supplemental
Figure S3A-F). We used the smoothed data for analysis because we expect volume growth to
be both smooth and generally to be monotonically increasing through the cell cycle. Error in
individual time-points was estimated as the magnitude of residuals (absolute difference between
volume time-points and fitted curves) (Supplemental Figure S3H). Growth curves with fewer
than 4 points were kept as unsmoothed. Volume growth curves were also fitted to linear and
exponential models and fits were compared using their residuals. Growth rates were estimated
from the smoothed growth curves using backwards difference (window size = 1). Confidence
intervals for CVs and P-values for differences in CVs were calculated from bootstrap analyses.
Nuclear volume reconstruction

To quantify nuclear volume, the H2B-Cerulean channel was automatically segmented by
thresholding pixels that were above the 50th percentile in intensity within a 31-pixel local
neighborhood using the scikit-image module in Python (Supplemental Figure S5) [47]. Small
holes and small objects in the thresholded nuclear masks removed by binary erosion and
dilation. The nuclear volume was calculated as the number of above-threshold pixels within the
manual cell outline segmentation, multiplied by the pixel:µm conversion ratio and z-step size.
Nuclear volumes calculated for cells in mitosis were discarded because of nuclear envelope
breakdown.
Analysis of framerate limitations
We analyzed in vitro human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) growth data from [12], who
acquired time-lapse phase and fluorescence images of asynchronously growing and dividing
cells expressing fluorescent reporters of cell size and cell cycle phase marking the G1/S
transition. We examined the time-series from these data, which were taken at 10 minute time
intervals. HMECs in these conditions had a ~20 hour cell division cycle and exhibited substantial
size control at the G1/S transition, but not during S/G2/M phases. The data were down-sampled
to quantify how lowering temporal resolution can affect cell size control correlations. The data
decimation factor was determined by down-grading the time resolution in [12] until it had the
same average number of frames per cell cycle as we have analyzed here for epidermal stem
cells in vivo (Figure 2C; Supplemental Figure S8A-B). For each cell, we down-sampled its
time-series starting with a randomly selected time-point and the process was repeated 500
times. The resulting randomized distributions of correlations were compared to the correlations
in the original data (Supplemental Figure S8C-E). While the G1 size control correlations are
similar between original and down-sampled data, growth during S/G2 is systematically
underestimated and a larger error in the correlation between G1 exit size and growth during
S/G2 is introduced (Supplemental Figure S8F). To further examine the effect of low temporal
resolution on S/G2 dynamics, we used successively larger data decimation factors and
observed that a spurious negative correlation between size at G1/S and S/G2 duration could
result from poor temporal sampling (Supplemental Figure S8G).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were done in Python using numpy/scipy and statsmodels [48].
Multivariate regression analysis was done using OLS and Logit from statsmodels. All correlation
coefficients (R) reported in the text are Pearson's correlation. P-values reported for Pearson's
correlation are tested against the null-hypothesis of R = 0. All intervals are given in the text as
mean ± std, unless otherwise noted. All code used in the study is available at

Figure 3. Epidermal stem cells exhibit sizers.
A. Cell birth volume is plotted against the duration of G1 phase (N = 197). Small jitter was
added in the plot to avoid overlapping data so all points can be seen.
B. The volume at which cells exit G1 is plotted against with the total duration of S/G2/M phases
(N = 197).
C. Schematic of cell size control correlations. For the adder model, the linear regression slope
between birth and division volume is 1. For the sizer model, the slope is 0.
D. The cell birth volume is plotted against the G1 exit volume (N = 197).
E. The G1 exit volume is plotted against the volume at division (N = 167).
F. The birth volume is plotted against the volume at division (N = 167).
G-I. The amount of volume grown during the respective phases are plotted against the cell
volume at the beginning of the indicated phase (G, H) or the entire cell cycle (I).
Solid black lines show the binned mean ± SEM. For D-I, dotted black lines show the linear
regression. Linear regression slopes are reported above the plots with 95% confidence
intervals. R values are Pearson’s correlations, with P-values reported against the nullhypothesis of R = 0. See also Supplemental Figure S10.

Figure 4. Size-dependent G1/S transition model for in vivo cell size control.
A-B. The logistic regression predicting the exit from G1 into S phase using cell volume (A) or
cell age (B). Dots are individual time-points (N = 1,024). Solid blue line is the logistic model, with
95% confidence intervals in dotted red. Dashed blue line is the midpoint.
C. The ROC curve from logistic regression models predicting G1 exit using cell volume (blue),
cell age (green), or both (red). The dotted line is the null-model of a random predictor.
D. Model of skin cell size control in vivo. For epidermal stem cells, variation in birth volume are
compensated by the size-dependent transition from G1 to S-phase, such that cells born small
will spend longer in G1 and grow more in G1. While the control mechanism is insufficiently
resolved for S/G2/M, the overall size control is a sizer, where cells divide at a size uncorrelated
with their birth size.

Supplemental Figure S7. Estimating final cell division volume.
A. Schematic of interpolated division volume estimation. We took the average between the
sampled final volume and the sum of the volume of the two daughter cells.
B. The cell volume growth curves are shown for ten representative cells, where the interpolated
division volume is shown in red.
C. Schematic of cell volume estimations used in Figure 3. We fit the data to a smoothing spline
to estimate G1 exit volume. We use the interpolated division volume as defined in (A).
D. The ratio of the birth volume of the smaller daughter cell to its larger sister cell (N = 167).
Dotted line denotes the median.
E. The distribution of the difference between sampled and interpolated division volumes,
normalized by the sampled volume. Dotted line denotes the mean.
F. The distribution of the sampled final volume (green) and the interpolated division volume
(blue) are shown for cells whose last frame is not during mitosis. Dotted lines denote the means
for the distribution of corresponding color.
G. The distribution of the ratio between the sampled final volume to birth volume. Dotted line
denotes the mean.
H. Examples of mitotic cells. The histone reporter is shown in blue. The actin cortex is shown in
gray. Scalebar is 5µm.
I. The differences between the sampled final volume and the interpolated division volume are
shown for cells that are in mitosis in their last frame (N = 11). Black line denotes the mean. Cells
in mitosis are larger than the sum of the two daughter cell volumes. (**: one-tailed paired T-test,

Supplemental Figure S8. Estimating the effect of low temporal resolution on size control
correlations.
A. The distribution of cell cycle phase durations of HMECs growing in vitro from [12]. The
corresponding number of frames is shown.
B. The data in (A) were down-sampled 20-fold so that we had the same number of time points
as the in vivo data. Compare with Figure 2C.
C-E. Cell size control correlations are shown for HMECs comparing original and down-sampled
data. Original data are shown in red, while the ensemble of 500 randomly down-sampled data
are shown in black. The solid lines denote binned mean data for original (red) or down-sampled
(blue) data. Cell size is measured from the cell size reporter generated by [12]. Birth size is
plotted against G1 growth in (C). Cell size at G1/S is plotted against S/G2 growth in (D). Birth
size is plotted against total growth in (E).
F. The Pearson’s correlation (R) between the cell size at the indicated phase-entry and growth
during the indicated phase are shown for G1 (blue), S/G2 (orange), and the total cell cycle
(green). The distribution of R from randomly down-sampled data are shown in solid lines. Dotted
lines denote the value of R in the original data for their corresponding colors. R for S/G2 phase
in particular shows a broader distribution in the down-sampled data.
G. The Pearson's correlation (R) between G1 exit size and S/G2 duration for increasing downsampling factors. Dotted line indicates the R in the original data. As the temporal sampling
becomes poorer, the distribution of R shifts left, indicating a spurious negative correlation may
be introduced by poor temporal sampling.
Related to Figure 3.

Supplemental Figure S10. Cell size control correlations showing unsmoothed data from
individual regions.
A. Cell birth volume is plotted against the duration of the G1 phase. Cells from each individual
region are shown in different colors.
B. The volume at which cells exit G1 is plotted against the duration of S/G2/M phases.
C-D. Birth volume is plotted against the volume at G1 exit (C) or the amount of growth during
G1 (D).
E-F. The G1 exit volume is plotted against the volume at division (E) or the amount of growth
during S/G2/M (F).
G-H. The birth volume is plotted against the division volume (G) or the total amount of growth
(H).
All data are unsmoothed and contain no daughter volume interpolation. Black lines show binned
means ± SEM. Slopes reported correspond to the slope of the linear regression and 95%
confidence intervals. R values are Pearson’s correlations, with P-values reported against the
null-hypothesis of R = 0. We note that not using smoothed data leads to the same qualitative
conclusions as using smoothed data.
