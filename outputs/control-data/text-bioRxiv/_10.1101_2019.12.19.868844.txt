ABSTRACT
TP53 ​mutations are associated with poor clinical outcomes and treatment resistance in
myelodysplastic syndromes. However, the biological and clinical relevance of the underlying
mono- or bi-allelic state of the mutations is unclear. We analyzed 3,324 MDS patients for ​TP53
mutations and allelic imbalances of the ​TP53 locus and found that 1 in 3 ​TP53-​ mutated patients
had mono-allelic targeting of the gene whereas 2 in 3 had multiple hits consistent with bi-allelic
targeting. The established associations for ​TP53 with complex karyotype, high-risk presentation,
poor survival and rapid leukemic transformation were specific to patients with multi-hit state
only. ​TP53 multi-hit state predicted risk of death and leukemic transformation independently of
the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System, while mono-allelic patients did not differ
from ​TP53 wild-type patients. The separation by allelic state was retained in therapy-related
MDS. ​Findings were validated in a cohort of 1,120 patients. ​Ascertainment of ​TP53 allelic state is
critical for diagnosis, risk estimation and prognostication precision in MDS, and future
correlative studies of treatment response should consider ​TP53​ allelic state.

INTRODUCTION
TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer​1​,​2​. In patients with myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS), ​TP53 mutations have consistently been associated with high-risk disease
features such as complex karyotype​3​, elevated blasts and severe thrombocytopenia​4​.
TP53​-mutated patients have dismal outcomes​5​, rapid transformation​6 to acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and resistance to conventional therapies​7​. Recent studies suggest that ​TP53 mutations are
predictive of relapse following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)​8​,​9 and of disease
progression during lenalidomide treatment in the context of del(5q)​10​. Upon AML progression,
TP53 mutations demarcate an extremely adverse prognostic group associated with a
chemo-refractory disease and less than 2% 5-year survival​11​,​12​. Therapy-related MDS with ​TP53
mutations is similarly associated with dismal outcomes​8​,​13​. These observations illustrate a
central role of ​TP53 in the pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasms and highlight its relevance as a
prognostic and predictive biomarker. However, ​TP53 mutations are not yet considered in clinical
risk scores such as the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R)​14​ for MDS.
The majority of ​TP53 mutations are missense variants clustering within the DNA binding domain
(DBD). Consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor, bi-allelic targeting is mediated by loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) involving 17p13 locus, commonly caused by deletion​15​. However, patients
present with both mono- and bi-allelic mutations. Functional studies link specific ​TP53
mutations with gain of function (GOF) and dominant negative effect (DNE)​16​,​17​,​18​, which may
explain the diverse presentation of ​TP53 mutations. Beyond the profound negative effect of ​TP53
mutations, the clinical impact of bi-allelic vs. mono-allelic ​TP53 mutations on outcomes and
response to therapy has not been fully investigated.

We set out to study profiles of genome stability, clinical phenotypes and outcomes of MDS
patients with ​TP53 mutations in the context of the allelic state. In collaboration with the
International Working Group for Prognosis in MDS (IWG-PM) (Supplementary Table. 1), we
analyzed a cohort of 3,324 peri-diagnostic and treatment naive patients with MDS or closely
related myeloid neoplasms (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Patient samples
were representative of all MDS WHO subtypes and IPSS-R risk groups, and included 563 (17%)

MDS/MPN and 167 (5%) AML/AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) samples.
An additional 1,120 samples derived from the Japanese MDS consortium (Extended Data Table
2) were used as a validation cohort. We described a detailed catalogue of mutagenic processes
targeting the ​TP53 locus, encompassing acquired mutations, copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity
(cnLOH), focal and arm level deletions. We defined distinct ​TP53 allelic states and showed that
each state is associated with unique profiles of genome stability and clinical presentation. Our
findings are of immediate clinical relevance with implications for diagnostic assay development,
reporting guidelines and risk stratification of MDS patients.

RESULTS
Characterization of genome wide allelic imbalances in MDS
Genetic profiling included conventional G-banding analyses (CBA) and a custom capture next
generation sequencing (NGS) panel that covered ​TP53 and genome wide copy-number probes.
Allele specific copy-number profiles were generated from NGS data using CNACS​9​. CBA data were
available for 2,931 (88%) patients. Comparison of NGS-derived ploidy alterations to CBA-derived
ones showed highly concordant results between the two assays (Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3a-b),
which allowed us to complement the dataset with NGS findings for 393 cases with missing CBA
(Supplementary Fig. 3c). Our custom capture approach further enabled the detection of focal
(~3MB) gains or deletions and regions of cnLOH (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig.
1). Eleven percent of patients (n=360) had at least one cnLOH region, frequently targeting
chr17/17p, chr4q, chr7q, chr11q, chr1p and chr14q (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Collectively, 1,571
(47%) patients had one or more chromosomal aberration, of which 329 (10%) had a complex
karyotype​19​ and 177 (5%) had a monosomal karyotype​20​ (Supplementary Table 2).

spectrum of identified ​TP53 mutations followed patterns from systematic sequencing studies
(Supplementary Fig. 5). As expected, 71% of the mutations were missense variants clustered
within the DBD. The 4 most common hotspots (R273, R248, Y220 and R175) accounted for 21%
of all mutations.
Among the 378 patients with ​TP53 mutations, 274 (72.5%) had a single ​TP53 ​mutation, 100 had
two (26.5%) and 4 (1%) had three (Supplementary Fig. 6). ​We mapped deletions of the ​TP53
locus in 97 cases, of which 18 were focal events detected by NGS-based analysis only. We also
identified 80 cases with cnLOH which were not detected by CBA (​Supplementary Table 3).
Approximately half (54%, n=149) of the patients with one ​TP53 mutation had loss of the
wild-type allele by deletion or cnLOH. In contrast, only 13% (n=14) of patients with ≥2 ​TP53
mutations had a concomitant allelic imbalance at the ​TP53 locus (OR=8, p<10​-13 Fisher exact test)
(Fig. 1a). According to the number of mutations and the presence of deletion or cnLOH, we
defined 4 main ​TP53​-mutant subgroups (Fig. 1b): 1. Mono-allelic mutation (n=125, 33% of
TP53​-mutated patients); 2. Multiple mutations w
​ ithout deletion or cnLOH affecting the ​TP53
locus (n=90, 24%); 3. Mutation(s) and concomitant deletion (n=85, 22%); 4. Mutation(s) and
concomitant cnLOH (n=78, 21%). Additionally, in 24 patients, the ​TP53 locus was affected by
deletion (n=12), cnLOH (n=2) or isochromosome 17q rearrangement (n=10) without evidence of
TP53​ mutations (Fig. 1a).
VAF measurements confirmed that the majority of multi-hit cases were indeed bi-allelic. In
patients with ≥2 mutations, the VAFs of mutation pairs were strongly correlated (R​2​=0.77,
Extended Data Fig. 2a), indicative of bi-allelic state. In 67% (n=60) of those cases, the mutations
occurred with certainty in the same cells, with a cumulated VAF exceeding 50% (​the pigeonhole
​
principle29
​ ),
thus confirming bi-allelic state. In addition, mutations within sequencing read length

were systematically observed in trans, i.e., on different alleles (Extended Data Fig. 2b-c). In
patients with an allelic imbalance at ​TP53,​ VAF estimates were enriched for values greater than
50%, consistent with loss of the wild-type allele (Fig. 1c). Taken together, VAF measurements
supported bi-allelic targeting of ​TP53 on cases with multiple mutations or mutation(s) and allelic
imbalances (subgroups 2-4). However, VAF alone was not sufficient to determine allelic state.
For example, we identified 19 cnLOH-positive patients with ≤50% ​TP53 V
​ AF (median 29%, range

3-49%), suggesting that 24% of cnLOH patients would be misassigned as mono-allelic on the
basis of VAF. Therefore, accurate determination of ​TP53 allelic state cannot solely rely on ​TP53
mutation VAF and should consider LOH mapping, as can be achieved by NGS-based analysis of
targeted gene sequencing panels with copy number probes, that are increasingly routine in
clinical practice. In mono-allelic cases, VAF densities suggested that ​TP53 mutations were
enriched for subclonal presentation (median VAF: 13%, median sample purity: 86%) as
compared to ​TP53 mutations from patients with multiple mutations which were predominantly
clonal (median VAF: 32%, median sample purity: 85%) (Fig. 1c).
We organized the ​TP53​-mutant subgroups into two states: A. mono-allelic ​TP53 state
representing subgroup 1, and B. multi-hit ​TP53 state encompassing subgroups 2-4, with
evidence of at least two ​TP53 hits in each patient. While the multi-hit state most likely reflects
the presence of clones with bi-allelic targeting, we maintained both “bi-allelic” and “multi-hit”
terminology.
Overall, the ​TP53 allelic states had shared repertoire of mutations (Fig. 1d and Supplementary
Fig. 7). Of note, truncating mutations were enriched in the multi-hit state (28% vs. 14%, OR=2.3,
p=0.002 Fisher exact test) while hotspot mutations accounted for 25% of mutations in the
mono-allelic state and 20% in the multi-hit state (OR=1.38, p=0.2 Fisher exact test). The differing
fractions of hotspot and truncating mutations between states might reflect discrete functional
impacts of both mutation types, representing dominant negative vs. simple loss-of-function. In
addition, ​TP53 allelic state, and by extension whether a wild-type ​TP53 allele is retained, points
towards differential potential for clonal dominance, whereby the mono-allelic state was confined
to smaller sub-clones and the multi-hit state was most frequently clonal.

(which is linked to state definition), there was a significantly higher number of chromosomal

multiple hits compared to the mono-allelic state (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3). This
enrichment was most pronounced for deletions (median 4 in multi-hit vs. 1 in mono-allelic state,
p<10​-16 Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig. 2a). In particular, deletion of 5q was observed in 85% of
multi-hit patients as opposed to 34% of mono-allelic patients (OR=10, p<10​-16 Fisher exact test,
Supplementary Fig. 8). Taken together, we found a median of 6 unique chromosomal aberration
in the multi-hit state and 1 in the mono-allelic state (p<10​-16 Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig. 2b).
Our data suggest that residual wild-type ​TP53 is critical to maintenance of genome stability, and
that the association between ​TP53 and complex karyotype is specific to the multi-hit state (91%
vs. 13% complex karyotype patients within multi-hit or mono-allelic states, OR=70, p<10​-16
Fisher exact test, Fig. 2c).
TP53​ allelic state associates with distinct clinical phenotype and shapes patient outcomes
Without discriminating allelic states, previous studies uniformly reported adverse effects of
TP53 mutations on clinical phenotypes and outcome​3​,​4​. These were recapitulated in our study
(Supplementary Fig. 9 and 10). However, when analyzed separately, the two ​TP53 allelic states
associated with distinct clinical presentation and outcomes.
Mono-allelic ​TP53 patients were less cytopenic (Fig. 3a-c) and had lower percentages of bone
marrow blasts compared to multi-hit patients (median 4 vs. 9%, p<10​-10 Wilcoxon rank sum test,
Fig. 3d). There was a higher prevalence of lower risk MDS subtypes such as isolated del(5q) in
mono-allelic patients, while the multi-hit state was enriched for higher risk WHO subtypes
(Extended Data Fig. 4a). In IPSS-R, 46% of the mono-allelic ​TP53 cases classified as
good/very-good and 29% as poor/very-poor risk, whereas only 5.5% of multi-hit cases stratified
as good/very-good and 89% as poor/very-poor risk (Extended Data Fig. 4b). These observations
link ​TP53 a​ llelic state to disease presentation, WHO and IPSS-R risk classifications, whereby
multi-hit state was enriched in higher risk disease.

The two allelic states had very different effects on overall survival (OS) and AML transformation.
The median OS in mono-allelic ​TP53 state was 2.5 years (95% CI: 2.2-4.9 years) and 8.7 months
in the multi-hit state (95% CI: 7.7-10.3 months) (HR=3.7, 95% CI: 2.7-5.0, p<10​-16 ​Wald test). In
comparison, wild-type patients had a median OS of 3.5 years (95% CI: 3.4-3.9 years) (Fig. 4a).

The effect of mono-allelic ​TP53 ​on OS was independent and not confounded by del(5q)
(Supplementary Fig. 11). The 5-year cumulative incidence of AML transformation in mono-allelic
TP53 was 21% and 44% in the multi-hit state (HR=5.5, 95% CI: 3.1-9.6, p<10​-8 ​Wald test) (Fig.
4b). Of note, the different ​TP53
​ -subgroups defining the multi-hit state (multiple mutations,
mutation(s) and deletion or cnLOH) had equally dismal outcomes (Extended Data Fig. 5),
illustrating that the various mutagenic processes leading to bi-allelic targeting of ​TP53 ​equally
shape the clinical routes of MDS patients.
The OS separation of the two ​TP53 states transcended disease subtypes and was significant
across most WHO classes (Extended Data Fig. 6a). It was less pronounced in MDS with excess
blasts and AML/AML-MRC arguably because other dominant risk factors exist besides ​TP53
allelic state. Differences in outcomes between ​TP53 states were also independent of IPSS-R risk
groups (Extended Data Fig. 6b), and multi-hit ​TP53 state identified patients with poor survival
across IPSS-R strata. Notably, 10% of multi-hit patients were classified as IPSS-R good/very-good
or intermediate risk. The implication of this finding is that assessment of ​TP53 allelic state is
critical to identify higher risk patients. In fact, multivariable Cox proportional hazards models
that included ​TP53 state alongside age of diagnosis, cytogenetic risk score​19 and established
predictive features identified multi-hit ​TP53 as an independent predictor for the risk of death
and AML transformation (HR​OS​=2.04, 95% CI: 1.6-2.6, p<10​-7​; HR​AML​=2.9, 95% CI: 1.8-4.7, p<10​-5
Wald test), whereas mono-allelic ​TP53 ​state did not influence OS or AML transformation
compared to wild-type ​TP53 (Fig. 4c-d). The same conclusion resulted from multivariable models
that considered overall IPSS-R score (Supplementary Fig. 12).
Recent studies reported additive risk effects for ​TP53 mutations and complex karyotype​3​,​11​,​12​,
highlighting that each independently contribute to a patient risk. In multivariable analyses,
multi-hit ​TP53 state and complex karyotype, but not mono-allelic ​TP53,​ were independent
predictors of adverse outcome (Supplementary Fig. 13). Despite the strong correlation between
multi-hit ​TP53 and complex karyotype, the additive risk effects remained in this setting, whereby
patients with complex karyotype and multi-hit ​TP53 state did worse than patients with either
complex or multi-hit ​TP53 (Supplementary Fig. 13b-c). In the absence of complex karyotype,
mono-allelic ​TP53 patients had similar survival than wild type patients while multi-hit ​TP53

patients had an increased risk of death (Supplementary Fig. 13c). This emphasizes the
importance of mapping ​TP53​ state alongside complex karyotype for accurate risk estimation.
TP53 mutation VAF had been reported to be of prognostic significance in MDS​30​. This is likely
explained by the strong correlation between high VAF, especially for values exceeding 50%, and
bi-allelic targeting. However, we showed that VAF as a criterion cannot accurately capture the
entire spectrum of patients with bi-allelic targeting, which includes patients with more than one
TP53 mutations in the absence of allelic imbalance and patients with subclonal cnLOH at VAF
≤50% (Fig. 1b-c and Extended Data Fig. 2). Optimal cut-point analysis​31 identified that patients
with mono-allelic ​TP53 mutations and VAF>23% (n=34) had increased risk of death compared to
wild-type patients (HR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.5-3.2, p<10​-3 Wald test), whereas patients with
mono-allelic ​TP53 mutations and VAF≤23% (n=91) had similar OS than wild-type patients
(Supplementary Fig. 14). While we may have missed a second ​TP53 hit in the small subset of
mono-allelic cases with VAF>23%, this shows that patients with mono-allelic mutations and high
VAF should be closely monitored. Conversely, multi-hit patients had poor outcomes across all
ranges of VAF, whereby even the subset of patients with low VAF≤10% (n=20) had very dismal
outcome (Supplementary Fig. 14). This highlights that VAF alone is not sufficient to determine
TP53 allelic state, which requires assessment of both mutations and allelic imbalances, and that
multi-hit ​TP53 state identifies very high-risk patients independently of the VAF of ​TP53
mutations.
Effect of ​TP53​ mutation types in clinical outcomes
The emergence of data in support of DNE​18​,​32 and GOF​33​,​34​,​35 led us to test whether outcomes
differed based on the nature of the underlying lesion, i.e., missense, truncated or hotspot
mutations. In the multi-hit state, no differences were observed on genome instability levels
(Extended Data Fig. 7) and outcomes (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 15a-b) across
mutation types, showcasing that it is the loss of both wild-type copies of ​TP53 that drive the
dismal outcomes of ​TP53-​ mutated MDS patients rather than the underlying mutation types.
In the mono-allelic state, missense mutations in the DBD as a whole had no effect on patient
outcomes compared to wild-type ​TP53​. However, there was an increased risk of death of

mono-allelic ​TP53 patients with hotspot mutations (R175, R248) compared to wild-type patients
(HR=1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8, p=0.02 Wald test, Supplementary Fig. 15c-d). This is consistent with
either DNE or GOF of the hotspot mutant proteins with increased selection of these mutated
residues. But this observation was not uniform across all mono-allelic missense mutations,
suggesting that the putative DNE​18 may not be equivalent across DBD mutations. Definitive
conclusions on the possible non-equivalence of mono-allelic missense mutations warrant
evaluation in larger datasets and functional studies that extend beyond the mutation hotspots.
Consequences of ​TP53​ allelic state in therapy-related MDS
Our cohort included 229 cases with therapy-related MDS (t-MDS), which were enriched​8​,​13 for
TP53​-mutated patients relative to de-novo MDS (18% vs. 6%, OR=3.3, p<10​-11 Fisher exact test).
The ​TP53​-mutated t-MDS patients had a higher proportion of multiple hits compared to
TP53​-mutated de-novo patients (84% vs. 65%, OR=2.8, p=0.002 Fisher exact test). Comparison
of genome profiles (Supplementary Fig. 16) and clinical outcomes (Fig. 5a) between ​TP53 allelic
states reiterated observations in de-novo MDS. ​TP53​-mutant t-MDS is considered one of the most
lethal malignancies with limited treatment options​7​, yet mono-allelic ​TP53 had lower risk of
death compared to multi-hit ​TP53 even in the t-MDS setting (HR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.15-1.0, p=0.05
Wald test).
TP53​ allelic state and disease progression
We analyzed serial data from 12 MDS patients of an independent cohort collected from the
diagnostic service of St James’s University Hospital (Leeds, United Kingdom)​36,37 who progressed
to AML with a ​TP53 mutation in either disease phase (Supplementary Fig. 17). We found a
preponderance of two ​TP53 hits at the time of MDS diagnosis (7/12 cases, with a median of 4
months to AML progression) (Supplementary Fig. 17a-g). In 3 patients, bi-allelic targeting
occurred during disease progression with evidence of inter-clonal competition and attainment of
clonal dominance for the ​TP53 clone (Supplementary Fig. 17h-i). The remaining two cases that
progressed with a mono-allelic ​TP53 mutation had other high-risk mutations in ​RUNX1 and ​KRAS
or in ​CBL (​ Supplementary Fig. 17k-l). These data provided further evidence that bi-allelic

alteration of ​TP53 i​ s a potent driver of disease progression and underscored the importance of
assessing ​TP53​ allelic state at diagnosis and for disease surveillance.
Validation cohort
We tested our findings in 1,120 MDS patients with comparable molecular annotations. We
validated the representation of ​TP53 a​ llelic states (Supplementary Fig. S18), genome stability
profiles (Supplementary Fig. S19) and differences in clinical phenotypes (Supplementary Fig.
S20). Our validation cohort was enriched for higher risk disease subtypes compared to our study
cohort (Extended Data Table 1 and 2). Overall, multi-hit patients had significantly increased risk
of death than mono-allelic patients (Supplementary Fig. S20e). Within lower-risk disease
subgroups, OS of mono-allelic ​TP53 patients was similar to that of wild-type patients
(Supplementary Fig. S20f).
TP53​ allelic state on treatment response
Recent studies report poor responses to lenalidomide​10 and HSCT​8​,9​ for ​TP53​-mutated patients,
and marked but transient response to HMA​38​. We conducted an exploratory analysis of overall
survival per ​TP53 state of patients that received hypomethylating agent (HMA) (Fig. 5b),
lenalidomide on the subset with del(5q) (Fig. 5c) and following HSCT (Fig. 5d). On HMA and
lenalidomide, patients with mono-allelic ​TP53 mutations had evidence of longer survival
compared to multi-hit patients (Fig. 5b-c). The analysis of our HSCT cohort was limited due to its
size, yet we observed a trend for improved survival of mono-allelic patients compared to
multi-hit patients following HSCT (Fig. 5d). These observations highlight the importance of
mapping allelic state in future correlative studies of ​TP53​ response to therapy.

DISCUSSION
The increasing prevalence of molecular profiling in clinical practice calls for an improved
mapping of genotype features to clinical outcomes, in order to identify meaningful biomarkers
and institute precision medicine practices​39​. Beyond biomarker validation, the delivery of
precision medicine practices is increasingly reliant upon precision diagnostics. This study

unraveled the distinct effects of the allelic states of ​TP53​, the most frequently mutated gene in
cancer​1​,​2​, with clinical implications for diagnosis, disease surveillance and risk stratification.
We developed a novel framework for the ascertainment of ​TP53 mutations, focal deletions and
cnLOH from unmatched custom capture sequencing data. Our copy-number tools CNACS is
accessible

platform

(​https://github.com/papaemmelab/toil_cnacs​). Through integrative analyses of the mutagenic
processes targeting ​TP53,​ coupled with large sample size and robust clinical annotation, we were
able to accurately characterize ​TP53​ allelic states and evaluate their clinical implications in MDS.
TP53 is universally considered as an adverse prognostic biomarker associated with genome
instability, treatment resistance, disease progression and dismal outcomes​16​,​40​. We provided
strong and definitive evidence that the multi-hit ​TP53 state in MDS, not the bare presence of any
TP53 mutation, underlies these associations. It is therefore critical to accurately assess ​TP53
allelic state in the diagnostic workup of MDS patients. Combining information from the number
of ​TP53 mutations, CBA, VAF and LOH status derived from NGS-based copy-number analysis or
SNP arrays would allow clinical laboratories to discriminate between the vast majority of
bi-allelic and mono-allelic ​TP53 mutations. Fig. 6 suggests an easily implementable workflow for
the assessment of ​TP53 allelic state in routine clinical practice. We propose that bi-allelic ​TP53
state should be distinguished from mono-allelic ​TP53 mutations in future revisions of the IPSS-R
and correlative studies of treatment response. This is meaningful for clinical practice as one in
three ​TP53​-mutated patients is mono-allelic. In our cohort, mono-allelic patients did not differ
from ​TP53 wild-type patients with regards to genome stability, response to therapy, overall
survival and progression to AML. Although ​TP53 is the most scrutinized cancer gene, our study
materializes to our knowledge the first assessment of the impact of the allelic state of ​TP53 on
disease biology and clinical outcomes in large MDS patient cohorts. Given the importance of ​TP53
in cancer, these findings warrant further investigation across cancer indications.

METHODS
Patient samples
The IWG-PM cohort originated from 24 MDS centers (Supplementary Table 1) that contributed
peri-diagnosis MDS, MDS/MPN and AML/AML-MRC patient samples to the study. Upon quality
control (Supplementary Fig. 1), 3,324 samples were included in the study (Extended Data Table
1). The source for genomic DNA was bone marrow or peripheral blood. The median time from
diagnosis to sampling was 0 days (1st quartile: 0 days, 3rd quartile: 113 days). The validation
cohort consisted of 1,120 samples from the Japanese MDS consortium (Extended Data Table 2).
Samples were obtained with informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
and appropriate Ethics Committee approvals.
Clinical data
Diagnostic clinical variables were provided by the contributing centers and curated to ensure
uniformity of metrics across centers and countries. Clinical variables included i) Sex ii) Age at
diagnosis iii) WHO disease subtype iv) MDS type i.e., de-novo, secondary or therapy-related MDS
v) Differential blood counts to include hemoglobin, platelets, white blood cell, neutrophil and
monocyte vi) Percentage of bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts vii) Cytogenetic data and
viii) Risk score as per the IPSS-R​14​. Clinical outcomes included the time of death from any cause
or last follow-up from sample collection, and the time of AML transformation or last follow-up
from sample collection. Detailed cohort characteristics are provided in Extended Data Table 1
and 2.
Cytogenetic data
CBA data were available for 2,931 patients and karyotypes were described in accordance to the
International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature​41​. CBA data were risk stratified
according to the IPSS-R guidelines​19 using both algorithmic classification and manual
classification by an expert panel of cytogeneticists.

WHO subtypes
Contributing centers provided for the vast majority disease classification as per WHO 2008.
Pathology review was performed uniformly on the entire cohort, to ensure concordance between
disease classification and diagnostic variables, and to update the classification as per WHO 2016.
IPSS-R risk scores
IPSS-R risk scores were uniformly calculated based on the IPSS-R cytogenetic risk scores and on
the values for hemoglobin, platelets, absolute neutrophil count and percentage of bone marrow
blasts.
Targeted sequencing
Panel design
The panel used for targeted sequencing included 1,118 genome wide single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) probes for copy number analysis, with on average one SNP probe every
3Mb. Bait tiling was conducted at 2x. Baits were designed to span all exonic regions of ​TP53
across all transcripts, as described in RefSeq (NM_001276761, NM_001276695, NM_001126114,
NM_00112611), and included 20bp intronic flanking regions.
Library preparation and sequencing
For library construction, 11-800ng of genomic DNA was used using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit
(Kapa Biosystems KK8504) with 7-12 cycles of PCR. After sample barcoding, 10-1610ng of each
library were pooled and captured by hybridization. Captured pools were sequenced with
paired-end Illumina HiSeq at a median coverage of 730x per sample (range 127-2480x). Read
length was 100bp or 125bp.

We also sequenced 48 samples on the panel, with the same sequencing conditions as the tumor
samples, from young individuals who did not have hematological disease; to help further filtering
of sequencing artefacts and germline SNPs.

Sequencing was performed in an unmatched setting i.e., without a matched normal tissue control
per patient, so that variants had to be curated accordingly (see section “​TP53 variant annotation”
below).
Alignment
Raw sequence data were aligned to the human genome (NCBI build 37) using BWA​42 version
0.7.17.

Sample quality control
Quality control (QC) of the fastq data and bam data were performed with FastQC
(​http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/​) version 0.11.5 and Picard tools
respectively.

In addition, a number of downstream QC steps were performed, to include:
-

Fingerprinting, i.e., evaluation of the similarity between all pairs of samples based on the
respective genotype on 1,118 SNPs. Duplicate samples were excluded from the study.

-

Evaluation of concordance between the patient sex from the clinical data and the
coverage on the sex chromosomes. Discordant cases were discussed with the contributed
centers to rule out patients with Klinefelter syndrome and filter out erroneous samples
appropriately.

-

Evaluation of concordance between CBA data and NGS derived copy-number profiles (see
section “Copy number analysis” below). A typical discordant case is a case where CBA
reports a given deletion or gain in a high number of metaphases and NGS profile clearly
shows other abnormalities but not the one reported by CBA. All discordant cases were
reviewed by a panel of experts through the IWG cytogenetic committee.

Finally, samples that passed QC but were found not to be treatment naive i.e., the patients
received disease modifying treatment before sample collection were excluded from the study.
Supplementary Fig. 1 summarizes the QC workflow.
TP53​ variant calling
Variants in ​TP53 were called using a combination of variant callers. For single nucleotide
variants (SNVs), we used Caveman (​http://cancerit.github.io/CaVEMan/​) version 1.7.4, Mutect​43
version 4.0.1.2 and Strelka​44 version 2.9.1. For small insertions and deletions, we used Pindel​45
version 1.5.4, Mutect version 4.0.1.2 and Strelka version 2.9.1. VAFs were uniformly reported
across

all

called

variants

using

a

realignment

procedure

(​https://github.com/cancerit/vafCorrect​).

Likely artefact variants were filtered out based on:
-

The number of callers calling a given variant and the combination of filters from the triple
callers.

-

Variants with VAF<2%, less than 20 total reads or less than 5 mutant supporting reads
were excluded.

-

Recurrence and VAF distribution of the called variants on a panel of normals.

-

Off-target variants, i.e., variants called outside of the panel target regions were not
considered.

TP53​ variant annotation
All called variants were annotated with VAGrENT (​https://github.com/cancerit/VAGrENT​)
version 3.3.0 and Ensembl-VEP (​https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-vep​) with Ensembl
version 91 and VEP release 94.5.

After pre-filtering of artifactual variants, likely germline SNPs were filtered out by consideration
of:
-

VAF density of variants consistent with germline SNP.

-

Presence in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)​46​.

Recurrence in panel of normals.

All remaining likely somatic ​TP53 variants were manually inspected with the Integrative
Genomics Viewer (IGV)​47​ to rule out residual artefacts.
From the list of likely somatic ​TP53 variants, putative oncogenic variants were distinguished
from variants of unknown significance (VUS) based on:
-

The inferred consequence of a mutation; where nonsense and splice SNVs, and frameshift
insertions and deletions were considered oncogenic.

-

Recurrence in the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)​24​, in myeloid
disease samples registered in cBioPortal​24,48​ or in the study dataset.

Copy number analysis
We assessed chromosomal alterations based on NGS sequencing data using CNACS​9​. CNACS
enables the detection of arm level and focal copy-numbers changes as well as regions of cnLOH.
CNACS has been optimized to run in the unmatch setting and uses a panel of normals for
calibration.

Supplementary Fig. 2 provides examples of characterization of allelic imbalances (gains,

genome-wide characterization of allelic imbalances on 2,931 MDS patients and compares the
levels of detection from CBA and CNACS. Note that for genome-wide analysis, we restricted the
CNACS gain, deletion or cnLOH segments to be bigger than 3Mb. Supplementary Fig 4 provides
examples of characterization of allelic imbalances by CNACS and SNP arrays on 21 selected
samples, with extremely concordant findings between the two assays.

In addition to CNACS, we also run CNVkit​52 version 0.9.6 on the study cohort. CNVkit does not
infer allele specific copy-numbers, so that it does not allow to mark regions of cnLOH, but it
estimates copy-number changes. The integration of two copy-number tools allowed to increase
specificity and sensitivity of the calling.

On 2,931 patients with CBA data, we performed a detailed comparison of CBA and CNACS results
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Along the annotation of regions of cnLOH, we supplemented the
presence of copy-number changes on those patients when it was clear on the NGS results but
missed by CBA. For the 393 patients with missing CBA data, we used the NGS results to annotate
copy-number changes. As our NGS assay did not allow to detect translocations, inversions, whole
genome amplification and the presence of marker or ring chromosomes, those specific
alterations were statistically imputed from other molecular markers on the 393 patients with
missing CBA.
Complex Karyotype
From the 2,931 patients with CBA data, 310 had a complex karyotype according to the CBA
results, where complex karyotype was defined as 3 or more independent chromosomal
abnormalities. Within the 2,931 patients with CBA data, CNACS results helped to identify
complex karyotype in an additional 15 patients. Within the 393 cases with missing CBA data, 13
had a complex karyotype according to NGS copy-number profiles (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Overall, 329 patients had complex karyotype representing 10% of the study cohort.
Survival analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using the R statistical platform (R Core Team 2019)
(​https://www.r-project.org/​).

Overall survival
OS was measured from the time of sample collection to the time of death from any cause.
Patients alive at the last follow-up date were censored at that time. Survival probabilities over
time were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology, and comparisons of survival across
TP53​-mutant subgroups were conducted using the logrank test.
Multivariable models of OS were performed with Cox proportional hazards regressions. Hazard
ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported for the covariates along the p-values from the
Wald test. Covariates included in the multivariable model of OS shown in Fig. 3c were age,
hemoglobin, platelets, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic risk
group and ​TP53 allelic state. Hemoglobin, platelets, ANC and bone marrow blasts were treated as
continuous variables and were scaled by their sample mean. Age was treated as a continuous
variable and was scaled by a factor 10. Cytogenetic risk group was treated as a categorical
variable with the intermediate risk group as the reference group. ​TP53 allelic state was treated
as a categorical variable with the wild-type state as the reference group relative to the
mono-allelic and the multi-hit groups. Note that those covariates correspond to all covariates
included in the age-adjusted IPPS-R model in addition to ​TP53​ allelic state.
AML transformation
In univariate analysis of AML transformation (AMLt), time to AMLt was measured from the time
of sample collection to the time of transformation, with death without transformation treated as
a competing risk. Patients alive without AMLt at the last contact date were censored at that time.
Cumulative incidence functions were used to estimate the incidence of AMLt and comparisons of
cumulative incidence function across ​TP53​-mutant subgroups were conducted using the Gray’s
test.

Multivariable models of AMLt were performed using cause-specific Cox proportional hazards
regressions, where patients who did not transform but died were censored at the time of death.
Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported for the covariates along the p-values

Extended Data Figure 1 | Landscape of chromosomal aberrations in MDS. a. Landscape of
chromosomal arm-level aberrations across 3,324 patients. Aberrations include copy-neutral
loss-of-heterozygosity (cnloh), deletion (del) and gain. The x-axis indicates chromosome arms or entire
chromosomes affected by aberrations. Aberrations were assessed using the integration of conventional
G-banding analysis (CBA) data and NGS derived copy-number profiles. NGS aberrant segments were
restricted to segments larger than 3 megabases. ​b. Frequency distribution of chromosomal aberrations
across 3,324 patients ordered by type of aberrations. First top three plots represent arm-level
copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (cnloh), deletion (del) and gain. Fourth bottom plot represents other
types of aberrations to include the presence of marker chromosome (mar), rearrangements where r_i_j
denotes a rearrangement between chromosome i and j, isochromosome 17q (iso17q), whole genome
amplification (WGA) and presence of ring chromosome (ring). All aberrations observed in more than 2
patients are depicted. Of note, cnloh is detectable with NGS but not with CBA. On the opposite,
rearrangements, presence of marker or ring chromosome and WGA were only assessed from CBA data.
On the 393 cases with missing CBA data, those specific aberrations were imputed from other molecular
markers.

mutations. a. ​Scatter plot of the two maximum ​TP53 variant allele frequency (VAF) values from the cases
with multiple ​TP53 mutations and no copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity or deletion (N=90). Points are
annotated according to the level of information of the mutation pairs. If the sum of the two VAFs
exceeded 50%, the mutations were considered to be in the same cells, which happened in 67% (n=60) of
the cases (triangle and diamond points). In some specific cases where the genomic distance between two
mutations was smaller than the read length, it was possible to phase the mutations. In the 18 cases where
possible to assess, mutations were all observed to be unphased, i.e., in trans (square and diamond
points). Within those 18 pairs of unphased mutations, 10 pairs had a sum of VAFs above 50%, i.e.,
mutations were necessarily on different alleles and in the same cells, implying bi-allelic targeting
(diamond points). b. ​Table of pairs of ​TP53 mutations from the same patients that could be phased. All
pairs were in trans, i.e., mutations were supported by different alleles. ​c. Representative IGV example of
unphased mutations (patient p12 from table b.).

Extended Data Figure 3 | Heatmap of chromosomal aberrations per ​TP53 allelic state. Each column
represents a patient from the ​TP53 subgroups of single gene mutation (top orange band, 1mut), multiple
mutations (top light blue band, >1mut), mutation(s) and deletion (top blue band, mut+del) and
mutation(s) and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (top dark blue band, mut+cnloh). Aberrations
observed at a frequency higher than 2% in either mono-allelic or multi-hit ​TP53 state are depicted on the
y-axis. Aberrations include from top to bottom the annotation of complex karyotype (complex), the
presence of marker chromosome (mar), deletion (del), gain (plus), rearrangement (with r_i_j
rearrangement between chromosome i and j), copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnloh), whole genome
amplification (WGA) and the presence of ring chromosome (ring). Note that the deletions of 17p of two
cases from the 1mut ​TP53​ subgroup did not affect the ​TP53​ locus.

Extended Data Figure 4 | Representation of WHO subtypes and IPSS-R risk groups per ​TP53 allelic
state. a. Proportion of WHO subtypes per ​TP53 state of single gene mutation (1mut) and multiple hits
(multi). t-MDS: therapy-related MDS; SLD: single lineage dysplasia; RS: ring sideroblast; MLD: multiple
lineage dysplasia; EB: excess blasts; AML-MRC: AML with myelodysplasia-related changes; U:
unclassified. Compared to cases with single gene mutation (1mut), multi-hit ​TP53 was enriched for t-MDS
(21% vs. 8%, OR=2.9, p=0.002 Fisher exact test) and MDS-EB2 (31% vs. 13%, OR=3.1, p<10​-4​). Contrarily,
mono-allelic ​TP53 (1mut) was enriched for MDS-del5q (15% vs. 2%, OR=8.4, p<10​-5​). ​b. Proportion of
IPSS-R risk groups per ​TP53 state of single gene mutation (1mut) and multiple hits (multi). Multi-hit
TP53 was strongly enriched for the very-poor category compared to mono-allelic ​TP53 state (74% vs. 9%,
OR=27, p<10​-16​).

IPSS-R risk groups. a. Kaplan-Meier probability estimates of overall survival across main WHO subtypes
per ​TP53 state of wild-type ​TP53 (WT), single ​TP53 mutation (1mut) or multiple ​TP53 hits (multi). WHO
subtypes MDS-SLD and MDS-MLD are merged together as MDS-SLD/MLD and WHO subtypes MDS-EB1
and MDS-EB2 are merged together as MDS-EB1/EB2. ​b. Kaplan-Meier probability estimates of overall
survival across IPSS-R risk groups per ​TP53 state of wild-type ​TP53 (WT), single ​TP53 mutation (1mut)
and multiple ​TP53 hits (multi). IPSS-R very-good and good risk groups are merged together (leftmost

Extended Data Figure 7 | Maintained differences in genome instability levels and outcomes per
TP53 state across mutation types. a. ​Proportion of mutation types across ​TP53 subgroups. Truncated
mutations (pink) include frameshift indels, nonsense or nonstop mutations and splice-site variants.
Mutations annotated as hotspot (purple) are missense mutations at amino acid positions 273, 248, 220
and 175. Mutations annotated as other-missense (green) are additional missense mutations or inframe
indels. Odds ratio and Fisher’s test p-values for the proportion of truncated versus non-truncated
mutations between the multi-hit ​TP53 subgroups and the mono-allelic ​TP53 subgroup (1mut) are
indicated in the pink parts of the barplot. ​b. Distribution of the number per patient of unique
chromosomes other than 17 with aberrations per ​TP53 subgroup of single gene mutation (1mut),
mutation and deletion (mut+del) and mutation and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (mut+cnloh) and
across mutation types. Note that 5 patients with both several mutations and deletion or cnloh with
ambiguity between the mutation type categories have been excluded for this analysis. ****p<0.0001,
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, each compared to the same aberration within the 1mut group. ​c. ​Kaplan-Meier
probability estimates of overall survival per ​TP53 subgroup across mutation type. Annotated p-values are
