PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DATA HARMONISATION

Abstract
Harmonisation of data for pooled analysis relies on the principle of inferential equivalence
between variables from different sources. Ideally, this is achieved using models of the direct
relationship with gold standard criterion measures, but the necessary validation data are often
unavailable. This study examines an alternative method of harmonisation by indirect
validation. Starting methods were self-report or accelerometry, from which we derived
indirect models of relationships with doubly labelled water (DLW)-measured physical
activity energy expenditure (PAEE) using sets of two bridge equations via one of three
intermediate measures. Coefficients and performance of indirect models were compared to
corresponding direct validation models (linear regression of DLW-measured PAEE on
starting methods). Indirect model beta coefficients were attenuated compared to direct model
betas (10-63%), narrowing the range of PAEE values; attenuation was greater when bridge
equations were weak. Directly and indirectly harmonised models had similar error variance
but most indirectly derived values were biased at group-level. Correlations with DLWmeasured PAEE were identical after harmonisation using continuous linear but not
categorical models. Wrist acceleration harmonised to DLW-measured PAEE via combined
accelerometry and heart rate sensing had lowest error variance (24.5%) and non-significant
mean bias 0.9 (95%CI: -1.6; 3.4) kJ•day-1•kg-1. Associations between PAEE and BMI were
similar for directly and indirectly harmonised values, but most fell outside the confidence
interval of the criterion PAEE-to-BMI association. Indirect models can be used for
harmonisation. Performance depends on the measurement properties of original data,
variance explained by available bridge equations, and similarity of population characteristics.

Harmonisation of Physical Activity Variables by Indirect Validation: A Doubly Labelled
Water Study

Harmonisation of exposure and outcome variables is an essential step when integrating
different sources of data for the same analysis, such as in meta-analysis of published results,
pooled or federated meta-analysis of individual-level data, and global surveillance of risk
factors for disease. Analyses of this nature which use information from multiple sources are
often constrained by the quality and compatibility of the original data (Fortier et al., 2010).
Harmonisation aims to bring together various types and levels of data which represent the
same underlying construct (e.g. physical activity, energy intake, body fat percentage etc.) in
order to achieve compatibility when methods vary between studies or study phases (Granda
& Blasczyk, 2011). The process does not strictly require that precisely the same original
collection and processing methods are employed in each study (Fortier et al., 2010), but the
harmonised data should be “inferentially equivalent”, i.e. their format, function and meaning
are the same (Atkin et al., 2017). This inferential equivalence will depend upon the scientific
context and the type of analysis being undertaken.
A common harmonisation approach is conversion to the level of the least detailed
information, for example transformation of continuous data to a binary categorisation of low
vs. high physical activity level (Kilpelainen et al., 2011). However, this approach loses the
resolution of the more detailed data, and may therefore limit the power and scope of
subsequent analyses. It is also unclear how well variables harmonised in this way relate to the
underlying true latent value of the exposure. An alternative approach to harmonisation is to
restrict analyses to only those studies which have assessed and expressed the exposure and
outcome in the desired way. This maintains the detail of the contributing data, but – as
highlighted by Aune, Norat, Leitzmann, Tonstad, and Vatten (2015) – greatly reduces the

proportion of the available data that can be included in evidence synthesis. At best, this leads
to loss of power. At worst, this leads to bias if the studies that are included with optimal data
have specific characteristics.
Another approach to harmonisation is to use validation studies which report the direct
statistical (e.g., regression) models of relationships between values from the less precise
methods and the latent true level of exposure, as assessed by a construct-specific goldstandard criterion method. A direct validation model permits transformation of original data
to the desired harmonised format. The problem is that this mapping approach is often not
possible because the ideal validation study employing gold-standard criterion methods has
either not been conducted, does not report the statistical model of transformation, or is not
applicable to the population or setting in question. This limitation may be more common in
particular populations or settings, such as those in which the feasibility or cost of gold- (or
even silver-) standard methods is prohibitive. Consequently, some populations and settings
may be studied with unsatisfactorily harmonised data or excluded from analyses altogether.
When the ideal direct validation model is unavailable, a potential solution may be to
use indirect validation models, whereby estimates from the less precise but more feasible
field method are mapped to a gold standard criterion using two “bridge equations” which
form an indirect route to the criterion via a third intermediate method (Figure 1). This concept
is analogous to network meta-analysis in which multiple comparisons can be inferred despite
not being directly tested (Lu & Ades, 2004). Indirect harmonisation adopts similar principles
in that it utilises existing, ideally published, validity data to derive a new indirect validation
model which can be used to transform data without the requirement to conduct de novo
fieldwork. By utilising a combination of published bridge equations and existing datasets, this
study examines such an approach by comparing the inferential equivalence of data
harmonised to the gold standard format via both direct and indirect validation models.

Methods
Theoretical modelling framework
We present a hypothetical analysis task requiring harmonisation of, at-first-glance,
incompatible starting values from a Method A to the format of values arising from a target
criterion Method B. One could use direct validation between Method A and Method B to
complete this task (direct validation model AB) but as mentioned above often an alternative
approach is needed. Here, we use intermediary values from a third method, Method C, for
which separate links to values from Method A and Method B are available. The relationships
between values from Method A and Method C (“Bridge Equation AC”) and between values
from Method C and Method B (“Bridge Equation CB”) are used to derive the indirect
validation model AB as outlined in Figure 1. In order to assess the validity of this indirect
validation approach, the indirect model for the AB relationship is compared to the direct
model.
Specific harmonisation task
Here, we use the example of harmonising values from four variations on Method A
(the starting point method) to total daily physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE)
expressed in kJ•day-1•kg-1 as measured using the same gold standard criterion (Method B).
For simplicity, we will use linear models to describe the links between methods.
The four sets of starting data from Method A were: (1) duration (minutes per day) of
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) derived from the Recent Physical Activity
Questionnaire (RPAQ) (Besson, Brage, Jakes, Ekelund, & Wareham, 2010); (2) total daily
PAEE expressed in kJ•day-1•kg-1 derived from RPAQ; (3) the four-level categorical
Cambridge Index derived by combining occupational physical activity with time participating
in cycling and other physical exercise, giving categories of inactive, moderately inactive,

moderately active, and active (Golubic et al., 2014; Peters et al., 2012; Wareham et al., 2003);
and (4) the mean daily high-pass filter vector magnitude signal from non-dominant wrist
acceleration expressed in milli-g (ACCWRIST) (White et al., 2018; White, Westgate,
Wareham, & Brage, 2016).
The gold-standard (Method B) for assessing PAEE (kJ•day-1•kg-1) was the difference
between total and resting energy expenditure as measured by the DLW method and two labbased assessments of resting metabolic rate, coupled with allowance for the diet-induced
thermogenic effect.
To derive the indirect validation model between values from the starting point Method
A and the criterion Method B, values from one of three variations on the intermediate Method
C were used: (1) mean daily trunk acceleration in m•s -2 (ACCTRUNK) (Brage, Brage, Franks,
Ekelund, & Wareham, 2005); (2) total daily PAEE in kJ•day-1•kg-1 derived from the
individually calibrated flex heart rate method (HR) (Brage et al., 2007; Spurr et al., 1988); (3)
total daily PAEE in kJ•day-1•kg-1 from combined ACCTRUNK and HR (ACCHR) (Brage et al.,
2004, 2007).
Data sources for bridge equations
To examine different aspects of the performance of harmonisation using indirect
validation models, one of seven variations on Bridge Equation AC was combined with one of
three variations on Bridge Equation CB.
If available, we used published equations to derive indirect validation models for
harmonisation purposes. If relevant equations were unavailable but correlation coefficients
and basic (mean and SD) summary statistics were, we derived the equations through backtransformation of standardised coefficients using the corr2data STATA command. If this was
not possible, we used individual-level data from existing datasets to derive equations
(pretending these were published validation studies), and subsequently used them alongside

existing bridge equations sourced from published work. The following sections describe the
data sources of each of the bridge equations.
Bridge Equation AC. Five variations on Bridge Equation AC were derived from the
Fenland Study, a population-based cohort study of 12,435 adults born between 1950 and
1975 and registered with general practices in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom. We
randomly split this dataset into five subsamples to represent five different and independent
validation studies. Participants attended our research facility and completed RPAQ (Besson et
al., 2010) and underwent treadmill testing for individual calibration (Brage et al., 2007)
whilst fitted with a chest-worn combined heart rate and movement sensor (Actiheart,
CamNtech Ltd, Papworth, UK) (Brage et al., 2005). At the end of the clinical assessment,
they were instructed to wear this device continuously for six days and nights and carry on
with their normal behaviours. Data from RPAQ were used to derive duration (minutes per
day) of MVPA by summing duration reported participating in activities with intensity > 3.0
METs (Ainsworth et al., 2011), estimates of PAEE calculated as frequency * duration *
intensity (Besson et al., 2010), and the four-level Cambridge Index (Golubic et al., 2014;
Wareham et al., 2003). The ACCTRUNK signal from the combined heart and movement sensor
was used in the format of mean daily trunk acceleration in m•s-2, while the HR signal together
with treadmill test data was used to derive an individually calibrated estimate of PAEE as
previously described (Brage et al., 2007, 2015). The two signals were also combined
(ACCHR) to predict PAEE using branched equation modelling (Brage et al., 2004). The
Fenland Study was approved by the Health Research Authority National Research Ethics
Service Committee East of England-Cambridge Central, and participants provided written
informed consent. The five variations on Bridge Equation AC using self-report as the starting
point were derived from the linear regression of: 1) ACCTRUNK on RPAQ MVPA; (2) HR
PAEE on RPAQ MVPA; (3) ACCHR PAEE on RPAQ MVPA; (4) ACCHR PAEE on RPAQ

PAEE; (5a) ACCHR PAEE on RPAQ Cambridge Index. To examine whether indirect
harmonisation is robust to variations in measurement protocol and population (i.e. a non-ideal
Bridge Equation), we used an additional linear regression of (5b) ACCHR PAEE on RPAQ
Cambridge Index. This was derived from the similar short European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Study Physical Activity Questionnaire (short EPICPAQ) administered in the EPIC cohort across 10 European countries (Peters et al., 2012;
Wareham et al., 2003) denoted by ACCHREUROPE.
To contrast the harmonisation process of self-report measures as starting points with
that of an objective starting measure, two additional AC bridge equations derived from the
linear regression of: (6) ACCTRUNK on ACCWRIST; and (7) ACCHR PAEE on ACCWRIST,
which were obtained from published work (White et al., 2016).
Bridge Equation CB. Three bridge equations were obtained from published data
(Brage et al., 2015) using the linear regression of DLW method total daily PAEE expressed
in kJ•day-1•kg-1 on: (1) ACCTRUNK; (2) HR PAEE; and (3) ACCHR PAEE, in doing so
linking to the prediction output from a Bridge Equation AC described above.
Direct Validation Model AB.
The inferential equivalence of harmonised PAEE values was assessed using gold
standard DLW method PAEE values from the UK Biobank Validation Study (BBVS)
reported in detail elsewhere (White et al., 2018). Briefly, rate of carbon dioxide production
(rCO2) was measured using the ten day DLW method of Schoeller et al. (1986) and converted
to total energy expenditure (TEE) using the energy equivalents of CO2 of Elia and Livesey
(1988) in 100 participants. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured on two separate days
during clinic visits with a fifteen-minute rest test by respired gas analysis (OxyconPro,
Jaeger, Germany), and scaled by a factor of 0.94 to account for RMR measurements being
conducted in the afternoon rather than the morning (Haugen, Melanson, Tran, Kearney, &

Hill, 2003). The closest measurement value (visit 1, visit 2, or their mean) by proximity to
the within-person median of predictions of RMR using three equations (Henry, 2005; Nielsen
et al., 2000; Watson et al., 2014) was used in analysis. Total daily REE was calculated, with
an additional adjustment of sleeping metabolic rate being 5% lower than awake resting
metabolic rate (Goldberg, Prentice, Davies, & Murgatroyd, 1988). Diet-induced
thermogenesis was estimated using macronutrient intake assessed by food frequency
questionnaire as previously described (Brage et al., 2015; Jequier, 2002). The REE and dietinduced thermogenesis were subtracted from TEE and divided by body mass yielding an
estimate of total daily PAEE in kJ•day-1•kg-1.
The four variations on the starting data (3 self-report and 1 objective measure) in the
Fenland Study were replicated in BBVS so that four corresponding direct validation models
predicting DLW method PAEE could be derived. Participants completed RPAQ and the raw
data were used to derive duration of MVPA, PAEE, and the four-level Cambridge Index. In
addition, participants were fitted with a tri-axial accelerometer (AX3, Axivity, Newcastle,
UK) on the wrist for 9 days and nights whilst continuing with their usual activities. The
ACCWRIST signal was used to approximate acceleration as a result of human movement and
expressed in milli-g (van Hees et al., 2013). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from
Cambridge University Human Biology Research Ethics Committee (Ref: HBREC/2015.16).
All participants provided written informed consent.
Deriving Indirect Validation Model AB
Beta and alpha coefficients for each Indirect Validation Model AB were derived by
substituting Bridge Equation AC (eq1) into Bridge Equation CB (eq2) to give formula eq3:
(eq1) Method C values = BetaAC * Method A values + AlphaAC
(eq2) Method B values = BetaCB * Method C values + AlphaCB
(eq3) Method B values = BetaCB * (BetaAC * Method A values + AlphaAC) + AlphaCB

Formula 3 simplifies to give the following formulae for deriving the new alpha (eq3a)
and beta (eq3b) coefficients:
(eq3a) AlphaAB = AlphaAC * BetaCB + AlphaCB
(eq3b) BetaAB = BetaAC * BetaCB
These formulae provide parameter estimates for the Indirect Validation Model AB
coefficients but not their standard errors. To propagate the uncertainty in the parameter
estimates from Bridge Equation AC and Bridge Equation CB to the new Indirect Validation
Model AB, 10 000 values of each parameter were sampled from a normal distribution with
mean equal to the observed parameter estimate and standard deviation equal to the standard
error of that parameter estimate; the formulae above were then applied to the sampled values.
The means and standard deviations of the resulting distributions for BetaAB and AlphaAB were
used as the coefficient point estimates and standard errors, respectively.
For the indirect validation model using the categorical Cambridge Index derived from
RPAQ, the categorical data were replaced by one constant and three dummy variables to
represent four levels. The above steps were then applied in the same way, but repeated for
each of the four values of BetaAC.
We meta-analysed the newly derived beta and alpha coefficients from each of three
indirect validation models predicting PAEE from duration of MVPA, thus generating a fifth
indirect combined prediction equation using all available information; this represents the
scenario where harmonisation is performed using multiple validation studies of the same
instrument.
Analysis
The inferential equivalence of each permutation of Indirect Validation Model AB was
assessed alongside an equivalent Direct Validation Model AB derived from the linear
regression of individual-level Method B data on Method A data available for 100 participants

in the BBVS. Method B values (PAEE) were predicted from Method A values using each of
the direct and indirect validation models and compared with values from the observed
criterion PAEE (i.e. the “true” PAEE exposure using the DLW method) by calculating the
mean bias and 95% limits of agreement, root mean square error (RMSE), and Spearman
correlation to assess the similarity with which individuals were ranked. Note in this
evaluation scenario, the mean bias of directly mapped relationships is always zero. We
derived the theoretical combined explained variance as the product of the r2 values from the
two linear bridge equations for each Indirect Validation Model.
Finally, to demonstrate utility, we examined the associations between all PAEE
estimates and body mass index (BMI) using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age
and sex in a subset of 1695 participants in the Fenland Study. All data processing and
analyses were performed in STATA/SE 14.2 (StataCorp, TX, USA).
Results
The characteristics of participants from each of the sources of data are described in
Table 1. The participants in the Brage et al. (2015) study were younger and more active with
lower BMI than participants in BBVS and the Fenland Study, including the subset reported in
White et al. (2016). Participants in EPIC were less active than those in the Fenland Study.
The criterion value of PAEE from the DLW method in the BBVS had a mean (SD) of 49.7
(16.2) kJ•kg-1•day-1 and a range of 8.6 to 90.8 kJ•kg-1•day-1.
The combinations of Bridge Equation AC and Bridge Equation CB used to generate
the Indirect Validation Model AB are shown in Table 2 alongside their r2 values. The newly
derived indirect validation models are plotted alongside the direct validation models in Figure
2.

derived from RPAQ. The beta coefficients for indirect validation models were attenuated
compared with the direct validation model beta (also see Figure 2). The correlation between
the predicted and DLW method PAEE values was preserved irrespective of harmonisation
method; however at group-level the values from ACCHR and HR indirect validation models
were significantly biased. Each validation model was characterised by a narrowing of the
range of PAEE values, and this was particularly pronounced when using ACCTRUNK values as
the intermediate method, the indirect validation model with the smallest combined explained
variance, most attenuated beta coefficient, and widest limits of agreement. The HR indirect
validation model resulted in predictions with the largest RMSE while the ACCTRUNK and
ACCHR indirect validation model predictions were similarly precise. Coefficients generated
by meta-analysing the three indirect validation models had smaller standard errors and
performance was similar to that of harmonisation via ACCHR.
Table 4 reports the coefficients and performance of validation models predicting
DLW method PAEE (kJ•kg-1•day-1) from a continuous estimate of total daily PAEE (kJ•kg1

•day-1) derived from RPAQ. Compared with the raw values of RPAQ-derived PAEE, the

indirect and direct validation models reduced group-level mean bias and approximately
halved RMSE. As for MVPA estimates, the correlation between RPAQ PAEE values and
criterion PAEE was maintained regardless of whether values were raw, directly or indirectly
harmonised. The ranges of the indirectly and directly harmonised values were much reduced
compared with those from the raw RPAQ and those of the criterion PAEE.
Table 5 reports the coefficients and performance of validation models predicting
DLW method PAEE (kJ•kg-1•day-1) using the categorical Cambridge Index derived from

and indirect harmonisation. For the direct validation model, the value of PAEE assigned to
being “inactive” was greater than that assigned to being “moderately inactive” and

“moderately active”; the indirect validation model values of PAEE for each category were
ordered more intuitively (also see Figure 2). RMSEs for the indirectly and directly
harmonised values were similar, and also similar to RMSEs using continuous RPAQ data
described above, however the group-level values were again biased when using the Fenland
Study data for Bridge Equation AC. The indirect validation model derived using the nonideal Bridge Equation AC from a less active European population showed unbiased grouplevel estimates of PAEE.
Table 6 reports the coefficients and performance of validation models predicting
DLW method PAEE (kJ•kg-1•day-1) from ACCWRIST (milli-g). Compared with the RPAQderived models described above, models based on accelerometer data as starting point and
mapping via other objective methods resulted in stronger correlations of estimated PAEE
with DLW method PAEE. The RMSEs observed for both the indirect and direct validation
models were smaller than for any of the RPAQ validation models, and with higher combined
explained variance; the range of PAEE values was also better preserved as shown in Figure 2.
To demonstrate utility of the different harmonisation approaches, we examined the
associations of PAEE with BMI in the Fenland study (n=1695); Figure 3 shows the beta
(95% confidence intervals) of these linear associations by harmonisation method and starting
data format, alongside that from the silver-standard ACCHR PAEE. PAEE estimates
harmonised from ACCWRIST showed statistically significant inverse associations with BMI.
There was a striking difference between models for the Cambridge Index, with indirectly
harmonised PAEE showing statistically significant inverse associations with BMI and the
directly harmonised PAEE showing no relationship. Other associations of indirectly
harmonised PAEE values with BMI were similar but more uncertain when compared to the
direct equivalent. All associations using PAEE harmonised from continuous RPAQ data

were weak with 95% confidence intervals crossing zero. MVPA data indirectly harmonised
to PAEE via ACCTRUNK values resulted in the widest confidence intervals.
Conclusions
This study is the first to examine and evaluate an indirect validation technique for
harmonisation, an essential step in any study which combines data from different sources in
the same analysis. Our findings indicate that indirect validation models can be employed to
harmonise data to a compatible format in the absence of the ideal validation study, but that
the harmonised values may still be biased at group-level, have a narrower value range
compared to the criterion, and that gains in precision are dependent upon the variance
explained by the contributing bridge equations. These findings reinforce the necessity to
carefully consider the inferential equivalence of harmonised data and “the truth” according to
the scientific context and the purpose of the analyses being performed (Fortier et al., 2010).
For analyses such as exposure-disease associations which primarily rely on relative
validity, harmonisation using indirect validation models is beneficial in that it increases
precision while retaining the correlation between the original data and estimates of the latent
truth from the gold standard criterion (when all bridge equations are linear). Our results for
RPAQ-derived PAEE demonstrate that even when data pre-exist in a seemingly compatible
format, improvements in precision are possible following harmonisation. Furthermore, even
if no harmonisation need be conducted, the newly derived indirect validation model could be
used to perform measurement error correction by regression calibration (Keogh & White,
2014).
Using indirect validation models revealed some unexpected advantages. When
harmonising Cambridge Index categorical data to a continuous estimate of PAEE, the direct
validation model assigned a higher PAEE value to level 1 than both level 2 and 3, whereas
the indirectly validation model was more logically ordered by mean PAEE in kJ•kg-1•day-1

using the indirect relationships in the Fenland sample or the published EPIC data. The
illogical ordering likely contributed to the null PAEE-BMI association for directly
harmonised PAEE, whereas the two logically ordered indirectly harmonised PAEE estimates
both showed inverse relationships. Given that validation studies using comparisons with a
gold-standard criterion are often relatively small, mapping of categorical data from
questionnaires to continuous metrics may be unduly influenced by incorrectly classified
individuals with extreme values. In a larger study such as a prospective cohort like Fenland,
the influence of incorrectly classified individuals on category means is diminished resulting
in more logically ordered group means. Thus in certain scenarios and under some feasibility
constraints, it is possible that indirect validation models using bridge equations sourced from
larger studies with silver-standard assessment are actually preferable to harmonisation using a
direct validation model from a smaller study using the gold standard. Although indirect
harmonisation is a potential solution in the absence of direct validation models, these findings
also suggest investigators should make use of all available information – both direct and
indirect – to optimise harmonisation efforts.
We observed that beta coefficients of indirect validation models were attenuated
compared to those from direct models, and that the level of attenuation is related to the
variance explained by the bridge equations being combined. We calculated the theoretical
combined explained variance which summarises the r2 values of the two contributing bridge
equations derived in separate studies; indirect validation models with a higher value tended to
have less attenuated beta coefficients, greater precision and less narrowing of the range of
resulting values. Shrinking of the range of harmonised exposure values towards the mean
when compared to the original data and the criterion will have implications for dose-response
analyses which aim to assess the shape of any relationship across the full exposure range. It
was noticeable that the indirect validation model for harmonising MVPA to PAEE via

ACCTRUNK had the most attenuated beta coefficient resulting in a very narrow range of PAEE
values and the widest confidence intervals for the applied example of studying the PAEE
association with BMI. A key finding was that associations between PAEE and BMI were
similar for data harmonised using both direct and indirect models; the two techniques may
therefore be inferentially equivalent but depending upon the validity of the original method,
neither may result in data inferentially equivalent to the true level of exposure. The utility of
all harmonisation equations is influenced by the quality of the data being harmonised and the
error of the methods used in the bridge equations.
For analyses which depend upon absolute agreement between harmonised data and
the latent truth, even greater caution is required as most values from indirect harmonisation
were biased at group-level. The bias was typically <15% and did not appear to be related to
the combined explained variance. The biases observed may therefore reflect differences in
the populations from which the bridge equations and the data undergoing harmonisation are
sourced. Perhaps most strikingly, the criterion measures of PAEE in the BBVS and Brage et
al. (2015) differed on average by 22%. The Brage et al. (2015) participants were younger
and had lower BMI so these are likely to be true differences, even though some of the bias
observed may be due to minor differences in the criterion method used to estimate PAEE in
the two studies, e.g. different RMR protocols. We examined the effect of using alternative
Bridge Equations from potentially incompatible measurement tools and populations by
deriving two indirect models for harmonising the RPAQ Cambridge Index to PAEE. The
indirect model using a Bridge Equation AC derived from the Fenland Study resulted in biased
group-level estimates, whereas the ‘non-ideal’ Bridge Equation AC derived from published
data using the EPIC-PAQ in the less active European population did not. It is possible that
the lower PAEE in this population counteracted any bias resulting from the higher PAEE in
the second Bridge Equation from Brage et al. (2015). The contrast may also be partially

attributable to differences between RPAQ and EPIC-PAQ. Any incompatibility of the
populations and assessment methods from which the two Bridge Equations are derived must
therefore be considered alongside the data being harmonised.
Further work is necessary to examine the suitability of combining bridge equations
from different populations and the generalisability of the resulting indirect validation models,
but our findings suggest that harmonisation is sensitive to differences in the true level of
exposure between participants in the bridge equation studies and those in the dataset being
harmonised.
One potential solution to population differences could be the addition of covariates to
indirect validation models, or, if the sample is large enough, stratification of results by
covariates. However, this would require some existing published bridge equations to be rederived, and limit future harmonisation to datasets with compatible covariates. Moreover,
adding covariates to the prediction likely requires that these are always adjusted for in
subsequent association analyses, as these may otherwise be driven by the covariates, i.e.
confounded. In addition and on a more practical level, it is often the case that regression
equations are not published, and this limits harmonisation efforts despite some of the
necessary fieldwork having been conducted. We have added beta and alpha coefficients
alongside their standard errors of the bridge equations used in the present study to the online
repository called the Diet, Anthropometry, and Physical Activity Measurement Toolkit
(www.measurement-toolkit.org) which enables sharing of such results and which should
increase the discoverability and use of population-specific validation models.
A potential limitation of the current work is that only simple linear bridge equations
were combined and that the participants in the studies used were all from the same region of
the UK; the generalisability of the technique to other populations therefore remains unclear.
While it was a strength of this work that we conducted indirect harmonisation with several

different combinations of methods, there are many more methods in use and the viability of
this process with other combinations, particularly when both bridge equations have weak r2 is
difficult to judge. In this study we were able to assess the validity of indirect harmonisation
using the equivalent direct relationship from a study with gold-standard measures. This will
not be possible in most other scenarios as direct models would be unavailable – the exact
problem that indirect harmonisation tries to resolve. In these circumstances it is not possible
to assess the precision or mean bias of indirectly harmonised estimates; the variance
explained by the two bridge equations provides an indication, but additional research is
required to examine this formally.
In summary, indirect validation models can harmonise data to compatible format
when direct validation models are not available, and can therefore improve the inclusivity and
resolution of data in analyses integrating information from different sources. The process
preserves correlations for linearly mapped continuous variables and increases precision,
however the range of exposure values is narrowed, and each of these traits is reliant on the
quality of the original data and the variance explained by available bridge equations. Further
work is required to examine the sources of bias and address potential difficulties when
generalising population specific equations.

Figure 1. Indirect validation model of the relationship between values from starting point
Method A and target Method B via intermediate Method C (broken black arrow).
Intermediate methods (Method C) are characterised by already established (published)
relationships with both the target criterion method (Method B) and the starting point method
(Method A) as indicated by the solid black arrows. The new indirect validation model AB is
evaluated against the direct validation model AB (solid grey arrow).
