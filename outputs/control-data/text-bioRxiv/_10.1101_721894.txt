Abstract
Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease, for which current treatment presents numerous
issues. Leishmania amazonensis is the etiological agent of cutaneous and diffuse
cutaneous leishmaniasis. The roles of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on
lymphocytes and its ligand (PD-L1) on antigen-presenting cells have been well studied
in tumor and other infection models; but little is known about their roles in non-healing
cutaneous leishmaniasis. Our previous report of L. amazonensis-induced PD-L1
expression on dendritic cells, in combination with decreased IFN-ɤ production by CD4+
T cells in C57BL/6 mice, led to a hypothesis that the formation of the PD-1/PD-L1
complex contributes to down-modulation of immune responses, especially T cell
suppression, enabling parasite survival and persistence. In this study, we tested the
therapeutic potential of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs)
against a non-healing L. amazonensis infection in BALB/c mice. We observed that L.
amazonensis induced PD-1 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and that antiPD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatment significantly increased IFN-ɤ-producing CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells, respectively. Compared with infection controls, mice that received
treatment with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1, but not anti-PD-L2, displayed bigger lesions
with significantly lower parasite loads. Treatment did not affect anti-Leishmania
antibody or IL-10 production, but anti-PD-1 treatment reduced both IL-4 and TGF-β
production. Together, our results highlight the therapeutic potential of an anti-PD-1based treatment in promoting the reinvigoration of T cells for the control of parasite
burden.

INTRODUCTION
Leishmaniasis is a disease with global public health concerns, particularly in
poor communities. Conventional treatments arose in the 1940s; however, many
problems are associated with these medications, such as high toxicity, adverse side
effects, and the increased incidence of drug-resistant parasites. At present, there are
no vaccines available for human use, which makes the search for new molecular
targets highly necessary1. Leishmania amazonensis infection can cause a diverse
spectrum of the disease, including cutaneous (the most common), mucosal, and
visceral leishmaniasis, as well as diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis that is refractory to
the conventional treatment2.
The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a cell surface glycoprotein belonging
to the B7 family is expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as neutrophils,
macrophages, and dendritic cells. PD-L1 binds to the PD-1 receptor, which belongs to
the CD28 family and is expressed on T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells3-5. The PD1/PD-L1 interaction leads to the suppression of T cells by affecting the gradual loss of
cell activities including cytokine secretion (IFN-ɤ, IL-2, TNF-α), decreasing the
proliferative capacity, and finally, inducing T cell apoptosis.6,7 The PD-L1 receptor is
widely discussed in oncological studies, as it is selectively expressed in many
tumors4,8,9 and in cells within the tumor microenvironment in response to inflammatory
stimuli.10 PD-L1 is positively regulated in solid tumors, where it can inhibit cytokine
production and the cytolytic activity of PD-1-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.4,11,12
PD-1/PD-L1-based monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy is currently in phase III
clinical trials with promising results for treatment against bladder carcinoma13 and lung
cancer14. Programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) is also a cell surface glycoprotein in the
B7 family and plays a role similar to PD-L1, because it inhibits T cell function by binding
PD-1 to the controversy in different models. T cell suppression is also reversed when
the receptor is blocked by a specific antibody, for example, in inducing oral
tolerance.15-17
It has been shown that PD-1/PD-L1-mediated cellular exhaustion also occurs
during the progression of chronic infectious diseases caused by viruses or protozoan
parasites, such as AIDS, toxoplasmosis, and cutaneous leishmaniasis.

and colleagues have reported that L. mexicana-infected PD-L1-/- mice have increased
production of IFN-ɤ in T cells, reduced disease progression, and greater control of the
parasite load when compared with infected wild-type (WT) mice. In PD-L2-/- mice,

however, there was an increased lesion size and increased parasite load compared to
WT mice, which implies there are differing roles for PD-L1 and PD-L2 in regulating
IFN-ɤ production. These results also suggest the participation only of PD-L1 in the T
exhaustion process during L. mexicana infection.15
We have demonstrated that L. amazonensis infection of bone marrow-derived
dendritic cells (BMDCs) from C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice induced PD-L1 expression.
Furthermore, L. amazonensis infection of C57BL/6 mice induced suppression of the
immune response through impaired IFN-ɤ-producing CD4+ T cells, which was not
observed in PD-L1-/- mice.21 In C57BL/6 mice, the lesion reaches a peak of growth
during L. amazonensis infection, followed by a process of resolution of the disease,
which shows that this mouse strain has a higher resistance to the parasite. In contrast,
BALB/c mice develop a progressive lesion without healing, suggesting a greater
susceptibility of these animals. Thus, we hypothesize that the use of anti-PD-1 and
anti-PD-L1 MoAbs would have the potential to reverse the T cell suppression
phenotype observed in BALB/c mice. Therefore, here we investigate the expression
of PD-1 and PD-L1 upon L. amazonensis infection in BALB/c mice, and evaluate the
use of MoAbs against PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 as therapies for the severe form of
leishmaniasis caused by L. amazonensis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Animals
Female BALB/c mice, 6-8 weeks old, from the Núcleo de Animais de
Laboratório (Universidade Federal Fluminense, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), were housed
in Ventilife mini-isolators (Alesco, Brazil) and kept under controlled temperature and
light conditions. All of the animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with
the Brazilian animal protection law (Lei Arouca number 11.794/08) of the National
Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation (CONCEA, Brazil). The protocol
was approved by the Committee for Animal Use of the Universidade Federal do Rio
de Janeiro (Permit Number: 161/18).

Culture of Parasites
Infective promastigotes of L. amazonensis (MHOM/BR/75/Josefa) were
obtained from infected BALB/c mouse lesions and were used until the 5th culture

passage as promastigotes at 26°C in M-199 medium (Cultilab) supplemented with
20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Cultilab).

In vivo Infection and Treatment
BALB/c mice were infected subcutaneously in the right hind footpad with 2x106
stationary-phase promastigotes of L. amazonensis in 20 µl PBS. The following
antibodies were administered intraperitoneally at 100 µg in 100 µl PBS; anti-PD-L1
(BMS-936559, Bristol-Myers Squibb), anti-PD-L2 (B7-DC, clone TY25, catalog #
BE0112, Bioxcell), and anti-PD-1 (CD279, clone RMP1-14, catalog # BE0146,
Bioxcell). The first injection was given at 7 days post-infection. Two treatment
protocols were assessed: (i) inoculation once a week for 49 days with a total of 6
doses; and (ii) twice a week for 56 days with a total of 12 doses. Control animals
received 100 μl PBS intraperitoneally also at 7 days post-infection and in accordance
with the two treatment protocols. For both treatments, the last dose was administered
5 days prior to the euthanasia of the animals. Footpad thickness was measured weekly
by using a direct-reading Vernier caliper.

Parasite Load Quantification
After the mice were euthanized, the infected paws were removed, weighed,
macerated with a tissue mixer, the homogenate diluted into 96-well culture plates (Jet
Biofil, China) and incubated at 26°C for 7 and 15 days. Promastigote cultures were
examined via optical microscope (Olympus, Japan), and the last well containing
promastigotes in the limiting dilution assay was recorded to calculate the parasite load.

Cell Staining for Flow Cytometry
Lymph nodes were removed and macerated with a tissue mixer; cells
(1x106/well in a 24-well plate) were cultured for 4 h at 37°C with Ionomycin (10 ng/ml,
Sigma-Aldrich), Brefeldin (5 mg/ml, Biolegend) and PMA (phorbol 12- myristate 13acetate, 10 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). All centrifugation steps were performed at 4°C.
Cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 50 µl/well (Human FcX, BioLegend) for
15 min. After which, 50 µl/well of the staining antibody pool was added and incubated
for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were washed with buffer solution (PBS with 5% FBS) at 400
g for 5 min, then fixed and permeabilized (FoxP3 permeabilization/fixation kit;
eBiosicence) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were washed again with

buffer solution and resuspended in the same solution. For intracellular staining, the
following antibodies were added (all used at 0.1 μg/ml) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C in
the dark: CD3 (anti-CD3-APC-780; clone 145-2C11, Biolegend), CD4 (anti-CD4-PECy7; clone RM4-5, Biolegend), CD8 (anti-CD8-PerCP; clone 53-6.7, Biolegend), PD1 (anti-PD-1-FITC; clone J43, eBiosciences), CD25 (anti CD25-PE; clone P4A10,
eBioscience), and intracellular IFN-ɤ (anti-IFN-ɤ-APC; clone XMG1.2, eBiosciences)
and FoxP3 (clone FJK-16s; eBioscience). Cells were washed and resuspended in 150
μl buffer solution, and stored in the dark at 4°C until acquisition. Cells were analyzed
on a BD FACS CANTO II flow cytometer; data from 100,000 events were captured
from cells acquired on CD3+ and analyzed with FlowJo® software (BD-Becton,
Dickinson & Company).

Analysis of Cytokines
The supernatants of the paw maceration were assayed for IL-4, IL-10, and TGFβ cytokines by specific ELISAs using a standard protocol (BD OptEIA).

Dosage of Immunoglobulins
Soluble L. amazonensis antigen (LaAg) was obtained from stationary phase
promastigotes, which were washed 3 times in PBS, freeze-thawed for 3 cycles,
lyophilized, stored at -20°C and reconstituted with PBS just prior to use. The 96-well
plates were coated with LaAg (1 μg/well) overnight at 4°C, blocked with PBS/5%
milk/0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h, and washed 3 times with PBS/0.05%
Tween 20. The mouse serum samples (1:250 diluted in PBS/5% milk/0.05% Tween
20) were added. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and washed
with PBS/0.05% Tween 20. Anti-IgM or anti-IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech) were added
(1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the color was developed with a
TMB solution (Life Technologies) and stopped with 1 M HCl.

Data Analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SD with confidence level p ≤ 0.05. For lesion
development analysis, a two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post-test was used. For
multiple comparisons, a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey pairing was performed.
Paired t-test analysis was done as indicated in the figure legends. Data analysis was
performed using GraphPad Prism® 5.00 software.

RESULTS
L. amazonensis infection induces PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
Previous studies by our group have demonstrated that in footpads and lymph
nodes of L. amazonensis-infected C57BL/6 mice, there is increased expression of PD1 on CD4+ T cells in comparison to naïve uninfected mice.21 Given that the disease
profile of L. amazonensis infection in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice are different, in that
BALB/c mice develop more progressive disease than C57BL/6 mice, we decided to
evaluate the expression of PD-1 in lymph node cells of L. amazonensis-infected
BALB/c mice. The data showed an increase in the percentage (Fig. 1a, c) and absolute
number (Fig. 1b) of PD-1+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in infected compared to uninfected
BALB/c mice.

Anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 MoAb treatment reduces parasite loads without
affecting lesion growth in mice.
As we observed that PD-1 was upregulated during L. amazonensis infection,
we next assessed the effect of treatment with the anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-PDL2 blocking antibodies on the disease profile. First, L. amazonensis-infected BALB/c
mice were treated with the individual MoAbs (100 μg each/mice) once weekly,
beginning at 7 days post-infection, receiving a total of 6 doses. The footpad thickness
was measured weekly, and the parasite load was determined after 49 days of
treatment. We found that this therapy was not effective in modifying the lesion
development profile (Suppl. Fig. 1a) or the parasite load (Suppl. Fig. 1b) compared to
control mice injected with PBS.
In the second treatment protocol, mice were given individual MoAbs twice
weekly, beginning at 7 days post-infection and receiving a total of 12 doses during the
56 day observation period. We found that although the lesion sizes (Fig. 2a) were
increased during anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 treatment, the parasite loads were
significantly decreased after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment (Fig. 2b), Suppl. Fig.
2b). Anti-PD-L2 treatment did not show any significant effect (Suppl. Fig. 2). These
results suggest the possibility of using the anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 MoAb therapies
to decrease parasitic load.

Induction of IFN-ɤ from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after MoAb treatment.
Focusing on the twice a week treatment protocol, we then examined the
mechanism underlying parasite load reduction in anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1-treated mice
by measuring the IFN-ɤ production of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells from the draining lymph
nodes. It is documented in murine models of L. major infection that the expression of
cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-ɤ by Th1 contributes to host protection, whereas IL4, IL-5, and IL-10 expression by Th2 contributes to host susceptibility.22,23 In the
murine L. amazonensis infection model, we and others have shown that impaired IFNɤ production and insufficient macrophage activation favor parasite survival and
persistence.22-25 In our treatment studies, we found more CD3+CD8+ T cells in the L.
amazonensis-infected mice compared to uninfected mice (Fig. 1a), but there were no
significant difference in the percentage and absolute number of CD3+CD8+ T cells
between the MoAb-treated and the PBS-injected groups (Fig. 3a, b). However, both,
percentage and absolute number of IFN-ɤ-producing CD3+CD8+ T cells (IFN-ɤ+CD8+
T cells) were significantly increased in anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1-treated mice when
compared to the PBS-injected group (Fig. 3c, d, e).
As the percentage and number of PD-1+CD8+ T cells were increased in L.
amazonensis infection (Fig. 1), we next examined whether the IFN-ɤ production could
also be affected in the CD8+ T cells lacking PD-1 (PD-1-CD8+) during MoAb treatment.
Similar to the total CD3+CD8+ T cells, the PD-1-CD8+ T cells of both groups of MoAbtreated mice presented a higher percentage of IFN-ɤ expression, but there was not a
significantly higher number of IFN-ɤ+PD-1-CD8+ T cells compared to the PBS-injected
group (Fig. 4a, b, c).
Regarding PD-1+CD8+ T cells not expressing IFN-ɤ (IFN-ɤ -PD-1+CD8+), there
was a significant decrease in the percentage of these cells in anti-PD-L1-treated mice
compared to the PBS-injected group, without any effect on the absolute numbers
(Figure 4 d, e). We did observe an increase in the IFN-ɤ-expressing PD-1+CD8+ T
cells in both the percentage and absolute number of anti-PD-1-treated mice, but there
was no significant difference in anti-PD-L1-treated mice compared to the PBS-injected
group (Fig. 4f, g).
We also investigated the profile of CD4+ T cells and found no major differences
between the MoAb-treated and PBS-injected groups regarding the percentage and
number of CD3+CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5a, b). Like the CD3+CD8+ T cells, the percentage

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/721894; this version posted August 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

of CD4+ T cells producing IFN-ɤ was significantly increased after treatment with antiPD-1 and anti-PD-L1 (Fig. 5c, d), however, a significant increase in the number of IFNɤ+-producing CD4+ T cells was observed in the anti-PD-1 treatment (Fig. 5e).
Unlike the PD-1-CD8+ T cells, MoAb treatment had no effect on the IFN-ɤ
production by PD-1-CD4+ T cells (Fig. 6a, b, c). Again, opposite to what was observed
in the IFN-ɤ-PD-1+CD8+ T cells, there was a significantly higher percentage of IFN-ɤPD-1+CD4+ T cells in anti-PD-L1-treated mice, with no difference on the absolute
number of these cells (Fig. 6d, e). Additionally, a significant increase in the percentage
of IFN-ɤ-producing PD-1+CD4+ T cells (IFN-ɤ+PD-1+CD4+) was found for both MoAbtreated groups compared to the PBS-infected group, which was not observed in the
number of cells (Fig. 6f, g).
Altogether, our results suggest that anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 MoAb treatment
stimulated the production of IFN-ɤ in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which may be one
of the possible mechanisms for the control of parasite load.

Anti-PD-1 treatment reduces IL-4 and TGF-β.
As IFN-ɤ production was induced by the MoAb treatment, we tested the effect
of treatment on the modulation of the cytokines, IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β, at the site of
L. amazonensis infection. Only anti-PD-1 treatment significantly decreased IL-4 (Fig.
7a) and TGF-β (Fig. 7b) production in situ compared to the PBS-injected control group.
No alteration in the IL-10 levels was found after MoAb treatment (Fig. 7c). Finally, we
demonstrated that treatment with the MoAbs did not affect the production of antiLeishmania specific IgM or IgG antibodies as assessed in the blood sera (Suppl. Fig.
4a, b). Altogether, our results suggest that anti-PD-1 MoAb treatment modulates the
production of IFN-ɤ in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, but anti-PD-L1 only affects CD8+ T
cells.

DISCUSSION
The use of leukocyte receptor blockers in immunotherapy has been extensively
studied in oncology.26 One of the clinical trials concerning the systemic administration
of therapeutic antibodies to block PD-1 or PD-L1 has produced promising results for
the treatment of several tumors.27,28 However, the use of this therapy is still relatively
limited in non-healing leishmaniasis.

L. amazonensis infection in C57BL/6 mice induced expression of PD-1 on CD4+
T cells (de Matos Guedes et al, submitted); however, in BALB/c mice the expression
of PD-1 was induced on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells prompting a more severe
impairment of IFN-ɤ production. For L. major infection in arginase-deficient mice,
deficiency in T cell activation resulted in increased PD-1 expression, impairing the
immune response and inducing T cell exhaustion.29 In dogs injected with L. infantum
antigens, PD-L1/PD-1 blockade with specific antibodies recovered the proliferation of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in addition to the production of IFN-ɤ by CD4+ T cells.30 In
studies of L. donovani infection in BALB/c mice, the parasite induced the initial
expansion of IFN-ɤ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the acute phase of the
disease, the frequency of which was reduced after 21 days post-infection even with a
robust parasite presence. In this model, blocking PD-L1 resulted in the restoration of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, leading to a reduction in parasite load.31 In view of
these studies, our results presented herein show that L. amazonensis infection
interferes in the production of IFN-ɤ by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
Recently, the presence of PD-1 and PD-L1 was detected in a patient with
diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. amazonensis.32 Based on the induction
of PD-1 and PD-L1 by Leishmania infection, the blocking of these molecules may be
a new strategy to treat leishmaniasis.
The use of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in clinical cancer treatment
studies, such as in pancreatic tumor, were administered at doses between 10 and 200
μg every three days.33-35 In our study, we tested a lower therapeutic dose of 100 µg of
the anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 and anti-PD-1 antibodies once a week. However, our data
revealed that this was insufficient in reducing the lesion size or parasite load.
Therefore, the dosage of the treatment, in terms of the concentration and frequency
of administration are important considerations. Thus, we increased the administration
to twice a week, and observed that although the lesion size was increased, the parasite
load in the infected footpads, in the spleen and in the draining lymph nodes that
received therapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 were controlled.
In L. major infection, only treatment with 1 mg/dose of the anti-PD-1 antibody
weekly in infected arginase-deficient mice led to complete resolution of the chronic
skin lesion and resistance to infection.29 A similar result was found when using the
anti-PD-L1 antibody in mice challenged with L. donovani amastigotes, as these mice
showed a reduction of up to 87% of the parasite load in the spleen.36 The susceptibility

of the C57BL/10 and C57BL/6 mice to infection by L. amazonensis is related to the
absence of Th1 type cellular immune response and not controlled exclusively by Th2
cells.37,38 In BALB/c mice, this susceptibility is related to Th2 type cellular immune
response.39,40
In this study, we observed that the production of IFN-ɤ was higher in CD8+ T
lymphocytes, both in percentage and number of cells after treatment with the anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 MoAbs. We also detected an increase in the percentage of IFN-ɤproducing CD4+ T lymphocytes after both treatments. However, when looking at the
number of IFN-ɤ-producing CD4+ T cells only in mice treated with anti-PD-1 a
significant increase was observed. These results suggest that treatment with anti-PD1, acting directly on the lymphocytes, is more competent in invigorating CD4+ T
lymphocytes than the anti-PD-L1 therapy, the target of which is in the antigenpresenting cells. Our data indicate that the increase of IFN-ɤ is one of the possible
mechanisms of the therapeutic efficacy of these monoclonal antibody therapies,
mainly by CD8+ T and partially by CD4+ T lymphocytes.
The PD-1/PD-L1 ratio is very important in suppressing the CD8+ T cell response
during L. donovani infection.36 In a study of dogs with symptomatic visceral
leishmaniasis by L. infantum, these animals were shown to have a five-fold reduction
in the proliferative capacity of CD8+ T cells and a reduction of up to three-fold in the
ability of these cells to produce IFN-ɤ. After administration of specific monoclonal
antibody therapy, PD-1 blockade significantly increased the proliferative capacity of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations, and recovered IFN-ɤ production in the CD4+
population. In addition, T cell depletion during visceral leishmaniasis was associated
with elevated expression of PD-1, which could be identified before the onset of the
disease and is considered a determining factor for symptomatic onset.30 In another
study of canine visceral leishmaniasis, it was observed that as the disease progressed,
there was a decrease in CD4+ T cell proliferation and also a reduction of IFN-ɤ
production in response to L. infantum antigens.39
These findings are reinforced by studies in which anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1
therapy reverts the ability of CD8+ T lymphocytes to produce IFN-ɤ as in the treatment
of thyroid cancer,40 in chronic hepatitis B,41 and in HIV infection.42 Further studies
should be performed to confirm whether T cell exhaustion occurs in L. amazonensis
infection. However, other studies that have assessed how chronic infections can
induce exhaustion, in addition to our results reporting the increased capacity of IFN-ɤ

production after MoAbs therapy, this suggests that T cell exhaustion occurs in L.
amazonensis infection.
Interestingly, our results indicate the MoAb potential to modulate the cytokines
present at the lesion site in the mice, as the production of IL-4 and TGF-β were
reduced in the group treated with the anti-PD-1 MoAb. The group treated with antiPD-L1 MoAb showed a tendency in the reduction of TGF-β. It is already known that
patients who progress to the disease have an increase in the production of IL-4
directed by a Th2 response and suppressor responses by the increase of TGF-β (L.
chagasi) and IL-10 (L. donovani).43,44 In another study, TGF-β was able to upregulate
the PD-L1 expression in dendritic cells, leading to T-cell anergy and diminished antitumor response.45 In visceral leishmaniasis, it has been observed that patients who
had progression of the disease showed increased IL-10 production,39 which was not
seen in our results, since the concentration of IL-10 showed a slight reduction in the
MoAb-treated groups relative to the PBS control. Thus, our data support the
hypothesis that IFN-ɤ produced by CD4+ T cells inhibits the development of a Th2
response by diminishing IL-4 and reducing TGF-β production. Moreover, it is important
to point out that TGF-β is associated with increased parasite load46 and its reduction
is directly related to parasite control. Hence, in our results, parasitic control may also
be related to the decrease of TGF-β and PD-L1 expression.
We also evaluated if the humoral response was altered during MoAb treatment.
Kima et al. showed that antibodies play a critical role in the pathogenesis and in the
development of more significant lesions due to L. amazonensis infection, since the
maintenance of infection by these parasites was impaired by the absence of circulating
antibodies in the BALB/c model.47 Recently, we demonstrated that L. amazonensis
infection in XID mice displayed smaller lesions and a decrease in IL-10 and total
antibodies in comparison to WT mice suggesting the pathogenic role of B cells in L.
amazonensis infection.48 Here, we demonstrated that treatment with both MoAbs did
not affect the anti-Leishmania IgM and IgG antibodies levels.
In summary, our study suggests a potential use of monoclonal antibodies
against PD-1 and PD-L1 in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L.
amazonensis. Our model, which employed a low dose treatment of anti-PD-1 or antiPD-L1 showed therapeutic efficacy to control the parasite load in infected mice. We
have also shown that this control is related to CD8+ T lymphocytes and, partially, to
CD4+ T lymphocytes, producing IFN-ɤ. These findings could potentiate a combined

against leishmaniasis, which could be particularly important for diffuse cutaneous
leishmaniasis treatment, a disease that is refractory to conventional treatment.

We would like to thank Bristol-Myers Squibb for the donation of anti-PD-L1,
through the sharing of these technologies we can hopefully present a new cure for
leishmaniasis. This work was supported by Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo
