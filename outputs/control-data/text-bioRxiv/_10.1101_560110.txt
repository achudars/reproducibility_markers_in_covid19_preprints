proteolytic events leading to short tau fragments that are more prone to misfolding (1, 2). In

AD, tau pathology spreads throughout the brain in a stereotypical manner along synaptically

connected brain areas (3). However, the process of tau secretion and uptake also occurs

physiologically and can be regulated by neuronal activity (4, 5). Multiple pathways for tau

secretion have been described, including exosomal and non-conventional secretion of free

protein (6-8), while uptake is thought to occur mainly through endocytosis (4, 9, 10).

However, neuropathological studies have shown that the endosomal-lysosomal pathway is

dysfunctional in AD, and these disturbances might play a role for both amyloid and tau

processing (11). Among the lysosomal enzymes, asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) was shown

to cleave tau at N368, and the cleavage product was identified by immunostaining as well as

mass spectrometry in human brain (12). Cleavage was also shown in the P301S mouse model

of tauopathy and was blocked upon genetic ablation of AEP (12). AEP is a lysosomal enzyme

age and is also elevated in AD, leading to the cleavage of additional disease proteins such as

amyloid precursor protein (APP) or α-synuclein (12, 16). AEP has therefore been proposed as

a potential therapeutic target for multiple neurodegenerative diseases (17).

While tau processing, spreading and uptake is mostly studied in neurons, other cell types

present in the brain might contribute. In particular, microglia as the resident phagocytes in

the brain are a major player in the clearance of protein aggregates, dysfunctional neurons

and the pruning of synapses in neurodegeneration (18). Accordingly, microglia have been

shown to take up recombinant as well as human brain-derived tau aggregates in vitro and in

vivo in mouse models (19), as well as phagocytose whole neurons containing tau aggregates

(20). Microglia may furthermore contribute to the propagation of tau pathology via exosome

secretion

in

vivo,

since

the

in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment can occur.

In this study we used a mass spectrometry approach to determine tau cleavage sites in

human brain, using both control and AD samples. We identified a novel proteolytic event at

of AEP and related tau cleavage activity. While we confirm previous reports of increased AEP

Methods
Recombinant human tau purification

All tau variants (full length protein and fragment encoding amino acids 168-368 or amino

acids 256-368) were cloned into the pET19b vector (Novagen) in between the NcoI and

BamHI restriction sites. The pET19b-Tau plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)

cells (Novagen). Cells were grown in LB supplemented with ampicillin at 37°C until OD600

∼

0.6-0.8. The expression of the Tau proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG. The

cells were then grown for an additional 3 h at 37°C and harvested by centrifugation. The cell

pellet was resuspended in running buffer (50 mM Na-phosphate pH 7.0, 1 mM EGTA and 1

mM DTT) supplemented with cOmplete protease inhibitors (Roche), benzonase (Merck) and

10 µg/ml lysozyme (Sigma). The cells were lysed by 4 passages through an EmulsiFlex C3

(Avestin). After centrifugation and filtration, the cleared lysates were boiled for 20 min at

100°C. After another centrifugation and filtration step the lysate was then loaded onto a

combination of a HiTrap Q and a HiTrap SP column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with

running buffer. After loading the sample, the HiTrap Q column was removed. The HiTrap SP

column

was

containing 300 mM NaCl. The HiTrap SP elution fractions containing the Tau proteins were

concentrated using a 30 MWCO (for full length tau) or 3 MWCO (for tau fragments) Amicon

centrifugal filter unit (Merck) and loaded on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg size exclusion

chromatography column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with running buffer. After SDS-PAGE

Thioflavin T aggregation assay

10 µM recombinant tau protein were incubated at 37°C in a black 96 well plate in 20 mM

Tris pH 7.5 containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.03 mg/mL heparin sodium

salt (Sigma Aldrich) and 30 µM thioflavin T (Sigma Aldrich). Signals were measured every

(450Ex/520Em).

Tau168-368 seeds were prepared from a 25 µM aggregation reaction, which was stopped well

after reaching the signal plateau (24 to 30 h) by shock-freezing in liquid nitrogen; aggregates

were then stored at -80°C. To prepare smaller seeds, tau168-368 aggregates were sonicated for

10 sec in a Sonorex super RK 106 Ultrasonic bath (Bandelin) and 0.5 µM seeds were added to

aggregation reactions with tau1-441.

Biotinylation of recombinant tau

10 mM Biotin solution was prepared from EZ-Link Sulfo NHS-Biotin (Thermo Fisher). The

solution was added to a 20-fold molar excess to 72 µM recombinant tau1-441 and incubated

for

2 h

on

ice.

and centrifuged for 1 min at 1500x g. The biotinylated tau was added and centrifuged for 2

min at 1500x g. The flow through was collected and stored at -20°C until further use.

For experiments examining tau release and uptake in microglia, media from neurons was

collected on day 15 of the differentiation, centrifuged at 2000x g for 5 minutes at 4°C and

supernatants were stored at -80°C until further use.

Microglia culture

Immortalized mouse microglia were obtained from Merck Millipore (SCC134) and cultured

according to manufacturer’s instructions. To study tau uptake, 800 000 cells were seeded in

a 12 well plate and recombinant tau1-441 (0.5 µM) was added to the cell media for 6 or 24 h.

NH4Cl was added to a final concentration of 20 mM where indicated. Cells were harvested

Electrochemiluminescence ELISA

To measure the tau levels in neuronal and microglial media, the V-Plex Human Total Tau Kit (Meso
Scale Discovery, Cat. No: K151LAE) was used, following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 150

Tau fragmentation is an important part of the neuropathology observed in AD, and many tau

fragments of unknown etiology have been previously observed in Western blot and mass

spectrometry

experiments

(1,

2).

In

order

to

identify

fragments

that

occur early

in

the

disease process, we started our analysis of endogenous tau cleavage events with human

entorhinal cortex samples from donors classified as either Braak stage 0-I (no tau pathology,

hereafter referred to as control) or Braak III-IV, which corresponds to an early, often pre-

symptomatic disease stage during the progression of AD (24). We furthermore decided to

analyze

a

detergent-soluble

fraction

of

the

tissues,

since

we

were

most

interested

in

proteolytic events occurring before the formation of mature tau tangles. We first enriched a

Triton-X soluble brain extract for tau via immunoprecipitation with a combination of three

monoclonal tau antibodies (Tau 12, HT7, Tau 5), which each target different epitopes and

should thus enable us to target a broad range of fragmented tau and full-length tau species

(Suppl. Fig. 1). We then applied two enzymatic digests in parallel, one with trypsin and one

with

AspN,

as

we

found

that

these

proteases

yielded

highly

complementary

peptides,

leading to high sequence coverage when combined (overall coverage for all samples ranged

from 73-91%, Suppl. Fig. S1). In the mass spectrometry data, we next searched specifically

for tau peptides that contained either C- or N- termini that were not due to the proteolytic

cleavage by trypsin or AspN digest, respectively. Such peptides thus represent physiological

proteolytic

events

spectrometric analysis. With the requirements of a Mascot confidence score of ≥20 and the

prerequisite that the respective site needed to be present in at least three separate brain

samples, we identified a total of 19 cleavage sites. For more than half of these sites, we

identified at least two peptides (Suppl. Table S1). Five sites have been reported previously

(1, 12, 25, 26), while the remaining 14 represent potential new tau cleavage sites. For most

MMPs (Suppl. Table S1).

The most prominent proteolysis event at N167 was detected with a total of four different

peptides and was observed in nine out of ten brains when applying a cutoff ≥20 for the

Mascot score (Suppl. Table

S1 and Table 1). Two additional

highly prevalent proteolysis

events were P172 (9 brain samples, 3 peptides) and N368 (6 brain samples, 3 peptides)

(Suppl. Table S1). Tau cleavage at both of these sites has been reported previously (12, 25).

Interestingly, both aa167 and aa368 are asparagines, and N368 is a known cleavage site for

asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) which has been associated with tau pathology in AD (12).

We therefore decided to further investigate tau proteolysis at N167.

AEP cleaves tau at N167 and N368 in vitro

In order to verify that AEP is the enzyme responsible for tau cleavage at both N167 and

N368, we next expressed either wildtype or cleavage-resistant tau mutants in combination

Upon co-transfection with AEP, tauwt is cleaved to a major fragment of 25 kDa, with almost

mutation prevents all staining with the Tau N368 antibody, as expected, and leads to a

strong increase in a band of approx. 35 kDa that is detected with both Tau5 and DAKO-Tau

(Fig. 1A, x). This band is absent in the tauN167Q mutant and does not contain the HA tag at the

N-terminus, therefore it likely corresponds to the tau168-441 fragment. A number of small

As

commonly done for tau aggregation assays, we used heparin as an inducer and measured

timeframe of the experiment (Fig. 2A), the fluorescent signal for tau168-368 increased strongly

to form fibrils, even though the protein is normally much more conformationally stable and

remains soluble.

AEP activity, but not the tau 168-368 fragment is increased in AD patient brain samples

While our mass spectrometry study detected both N167 and N368 tau cleavage in brains

from controls and AD patients alike, the method was not quantitative and thus not suitable

to investigate potential disease-relevant differences in tau processing. Furthermore, mass

spectrometry did not allow us to assess whether the

tau168-368

fragment exists as such in

human brain or if only single cleavage events were observed in vivo. We therefore analyzed

our cohort of human brain tissues by Western blotting. As expected, Tau5 antibody staining

yielded many bands between 75-20 kDa in size, corresponding to different tau isoforms and

cleavage fragments (Fig. 3A). The Tau N368 antibody on the other hand stained a major

band at 25 kDa, corresponding in size with the recombinant tau168-368 fragment (Fig. 3A), as

well as a minor band at approx. 20 kDa. This band may correspond to the 3R isoform of the

tau168-368 fragment, which lacks the R2 domain (Fig. 1B). Both bands also overlap with Tau5

staining. Quantification of the tau168-368 4R fragment in a total of 9 control and 9 AD brain

samples showed no difference in band intensity, suggesting that the fragment is present at

equal levels in control and AD brains (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, Tau N368 did not stain any

bands at the height expected for the tau256-368 fragment (approx. 12 kDa, as observed for the

recombinant protein), in agreement with the fact that we did not detect the previously

reported N255 cleavage (12) site by mass spectrometry, even though the area of the protein

was well covered by peptides. We furthermore did not detect differences in the overall

levels of tau in our samples as determined by quantification of the Tau5 signal (Fig. 3C).

of the tau 168-368 fragment, it is possible that AEP-mediated tau cleavage is a physiological

event occurring in control as well as AD patient brains and may only be an intermediate step

in the proteolytic degradation of tau without any accumulation of tau168-368.

Full-length tau is cleaved upon uptake into AEP-expressing cells

AEP is a predominantly lysosomal enzyme and is active at an acidic pH (13). Since tau can be

secreted and taken up by cells, and the described mechanisms for tau uptake deliver their

cargo to endo/lysosomes, we were wondering if AEP-mediated cleavage of tau may occur

during this process. We started by adding recombinant, monomeric tau1-441 or the tau168-368

fragment to the medium of HEK-293 cells, which do not produce endogenous tau. When we

subsequently analyzed cell lysates for the presence of tau, we observed that both tau1-441

and the tau168-368 fragment were readily taken up; however, we did not observe any cleavage

(Fig. 4A). This may be due to non-detectable amounts of endogenous AEP in HEK-293 cells

(Fig. 4A). In contrast, when we transfected HEK-293 cells with AEP, tau1-441 was taken up and

cleaved to tau168-368, as observed by staining with the Tau5 and Tau N368 antibodies (Fig.

4A).

kDa, which was positive for Tau5 staining, but negative for Tau N368 (Fig. 4A), and we

therefore concluded that it likely corresponds to the tau168-441 processing intermediate (Fig.

1A). As observed previously (Fig. 1A), AEP transfection alone leads to a non-specific band at

approx. 25 kDa detected by Tau N368, which overlaps with the tau168-368 signal (Fig. 4A).

Microglia, but not neurons express sufficient AEP to cleave tau

Our results thus far show that the presence of active AEP is a prerequisite for tau cleavage at

and

N368,

and

previous

studies

suggest

that

AEP

is

highly

expressed

Neurons

derived

from

induced

pluripotent stem cells (iPS) on the other hand exhibited very low levels of AEP (Fig. 4B). We

then assessed which of these two cell types was able to cleave tau after uptake from the

culture medium. Since neurons express large amounts of tau protein endogenously, we used

recombinant, biotinylated tau 1-441 protein for this assay. Western blot analysis of neuronal

lysates using a streptavidin antibody demonstrated that exogenous tau was internalized, but

specific cleavage fragments sensitive to NH4Cl treatment were not detected (Suppl. Fig. S2).

Microglia, on the other hand, took up tau1-441 and digested it to a main fragment of approx.

35

kDa,

a

size

corresponding

to

tau168-441

(Fig.

Interestingly,

this

fragment

did

accumulate over time, while cleavage was prevented by NH4Cl treatment, confirming the

pH-dependent activity of the protease (Fig. 4C).

To investigate whether tau is completely removed by microglia, we next assessed microglia

medium 24 h after the addition of recombinant tau 1-441. While full-length tau was readily

detected in medium incubated in the absence of cells, the presence of microglia led to the

complete disappearance of tau protein during this time period (Fig. 5A). Tau removal was

not affected by the addition of NH4Cl, suggesting that tau uptake can occur even during

lysosomal

dysfunction.

since no re-released fragments were detected.

and robustly express tau protein starting at day 15 after differentiation (Suppl. Fig. S3), and

we also detected tau released into the culture medium at this timepoint using a sensitive

electrochemiluminescence ELISA method (Fig. 5B). To investigate the effect of microglia on

the secreted tau protein, we transplanted conditioned neuronal medium onto microglial

cells. After an incubation period of 24 h we found that the tau levels in the medium had

significantly decreased (Fig. 5B), similar to the effect previously observed for recombinant

tau (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the addition of NH4Cl during the last 6 h of incubation led to an

even stronger decrease of tau levels (Fig. 5B). This confirms that microglia can efficiently

take up tau even in the absence of functional lysosomal cleavage and degradation pathways,

and the increased tau uptake is furthermore in agreement with a previous report showing

that microglial endocytosis is facilitated by NH4Cl-mediated changes in intracellular pH (29).

Discussion

In this study, we used a mass spectrometry approach to identify tau cleavage events in

human brain tissue from AD patients and age-matched control subjects. We identified a

previously

unknown,

but

highly

prevalent

proteolytic

event

at

N167

of

tau,

which

was

detected with high confidence in nine out of ten brain samples analyzed. In vitro studies

revealed that this site is processed by AEP, a protease that has previously been linked to AD

and was shown to cleave tau at both N368 and N255 (12). While we confirmed processing at

the N368 site in our samples, we did not observe tau cleavage at N255 in human brain,

although our mass spectrometric approach revealed peptides mapping this region. However,

it is possible that N255 is only processed subsequent to other cleavage events, generating

fragments that would have migrated on the SDS-PAGE below the area we excised for their

mass spectrometric analysis. This is consistent with our in vitro findings, where the only

bands that were consistently generated by AEP from tauwt, tauN167Q and tauN368Q (and may

thus correspond to N255 cleavage) were small (10-15 kDa). Taken together this suggests that

the site can be processed downstream of other cleavage events, but fragments may not be

very abundant in vivo.

Previous studies have shown that AEP activity is increased both during aging and in AD brain

tissue (12, 16). We also found a significant increase in active AEP enzyme in tissues from AD

patients compared to controls, however this did not result in an increase in the tau168-368

fragment. In fact, the equal abundance of tau168-368 in control and AD patient brains suggests

that tau cleavage by AEP is a physiological event, and the lack of tau fragment accumulation

over time in vitro furthermore points towards tau168-368 being an intermediate product of a

degradation pathway.

AEP has been described as an important protease in inflammatory signaling, and one of its

unique substrates is TLR9 (15, 30). Accordingly, we also found that microglia, the resident

macrophage cells of the brain, express more AEP than neurons and mostly contain the active

form of the enzyme. While aberrant AEP activity in neurons has been reported under special

conditions (14, 31), we do not observe AEP-mediated tau cleavage in iPS-derived neurons.

NH4Cl.

In

tau

leads

to

the

complete

removal of all tau protein from the culture medium without an intracellular accumulation of

the

spreading of pathology in vivo, which may be promoted by microglial dysfunction in the

prone and, once misfolded, can seed the aggregation of full-length tau. Nevertheless, tau

processing in microglia can only have an effect on spreading and pathology if the protein is

not fully degraded after uptake, for example due to endolysosomal dysfunction (11), post-

translational modifications or misfolding events that prevent tau cleavage (34). Therapeutic

process may in fact be harmful, especially since AEP is also an important player in TLR-

The aggregation of recombinant tau168-368 was measured over time using the amyloid-

binding dye thioflavin T (ThT). Full-length tau1-441 did not form ThT positive aggregates under

the same conditions. Statistical significance was determined by two-way repeated measures

ANOVA (time p < 0.0001, sample type p < 0.0001). Tukey’s post hoc analysis was used to

determine that the tau168-368 sample is significantly different from both tau1-441 and buffer
