ABSTRACT (250 words)
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are a heterogeneous collection of neurodevelopmental
disorders with a strong genetic basis. Recent studies identified that a single hit of either a de
novo or transmitted gene-disrupting, or likely gene-disrupting, mutation in a subset of 65
strongly associated genes can be sufficient to generate an ASD phenotype. We took
advantage of consanguineous families with an ASD proband to evaluate this model. By a
genome-wide homozygosity mapping of ten families with eleven children displaying ASD, we
identified a linkage region of 133 kb in five families at the 3p14.2 locus that includes FEZF2
with a LOD score of 5.8 suggesting a founder effect. Sequencing FEZF2 revealed a common
deletion of four codons. However, the damaging FEZF2 mutation did not appear to be sufficient
to induce the disease as non-affected parents also carry the mutation and, similarly, Fezf2
knockout mouse embryos electroporated with the mutant human FEZF2 construct did not
display any obvious defects in the corticospinal tract, a pathway whose development depends
on FEZF2. We extended the genetic analysis of these five FEZF2-linked families versus five
FEZF2 non-linked families by studying de novo and transmitted copy number variation (CNV)
and performing Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). We identified damaging mutations in the
subset of 65 genes strongly associated with ASD whose co-expression analysis suggests an
impact on the prefrontal cortex during the mid-fetal periods. From these results, we propose
that both FEZF2 deletion and multiple hits in the repertoire of these 65 genes are necessary
to generate an ASD phenotype.

Significance Statement (120 words)
The human neocortex is a highly organized laminar structure with neuron positioning and
identity of deep-layer cortical neurons that depend on key transcription factors, such as FEZF2,
SATB2, TSHZ3 and TBR1. These genes have a specific spatio-temporal pattern of expression
in human midfetal deep cortical projection neurons and display mutations in patients with
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Here, we identified a linkage region involving FEZF2 gene
in five consanguineous families with an ASD proband. For these FEZF2-allele linked probands,
we identified a four-codon deletion in FEZF2 and damaging mutations in other high-risk ASD
genes, that exhibit regional and cell type–specific convergence in neocortical deep-layer
excitatory neurons, suggesting a multi-hit genomic architecture of ASD in these
consanguineous families.

Introduction
The genetics and genomics of neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) have made unprecedented
progress recently, in particular for unravelling the genetic architecture of Autism Spectrum
Disorders (ASDs) (1, 2). ASD is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous
neurodevelopmental condition that is characterized by deficits in reciprocal social interaction,
repetitive behavior patterns, and restricted interests (3), with a prevalence as high as 1 in 68
children (4). Both de novo and transmitted multiple definitive risk-carrying copy number
variations (CNVs), protein-altering mutations, and/or non-coding alleles have been identified
in ASD (5, 6). Recent studies leveraged the statistical power afforded by rare de novo
putatively damaging variants and have identified more than 65 strongly associated or highconfidence genes (5). The most deleterious variants that are likely gene-disrupting in the
highest confidence subset (False Discovery Rate, FDR ≤ 0.01) of these genes (n = 30) as a
group confer ∼20-fold increase in risk (5). To date, there is very little evidence for a multi-hit
hypothesis vis-á-vis these highly damaging de novo coding mutations (6). Willsey et al.
proposed a model with a single highly protein-disrupting mutation causing functional
haploinsufficiency and thus sufficient to confer these very large risks (6).
Our aim was to study consanguineous families with autism probands in order to test
whether the single hit model applies to these families with a possible founder effect, and
whether single hit high-risk genes are part of these 65 strongly associated genes.
Homozygosity mapping in pedigrees with shared ancestry has been a powerful methodology
to identify autosomal recessive disease genes in ASDs and to advance our understanding of
the genetic architecture of these complex diseases (7, 8, 9). Here, we identified ten simplex,
consanguineous families from Morocco and performed whole-genome linkage studies and
whole-exome sequencing (WES) in order to validate a genetic architecture based either on a
single hit model or on multiple hits.

Results
Homozygosity mapping implicates FEZF2-linked locus in ASD etiology
Figure 1

Supplementary Table S1
Supplementary Table S2
Supplementary Table S3

We used homozygosity mapping, CNV analysis followed by WES, and Sanger sequencing
strategies to identify disease-related mutations in ten trios (parents and affected child) from
consanguineous ASD families.
We first performed a genome-wide homozygosity mapping linkage analysis in ten trios in which
the parents are either first or second cousins. All patients were examined and diagnosed using
ADI-R (Supplementary Table S1). The M/F ratio of affected children in these consanguineous
families was 2.6:1 (8 males, 3 females), and this ratio is comparable to the ratio found in
consanguineous multiplex pedigrees from a previous study (8). The linkage analysis revealed
several genetic loci overlapping between pedigrees with strong support for linkage with
logarithm of odds (LOD) scores ranging from 3.6 to 5.8 (Supplementary Table S2). One
region of 133 kb that includes the FEZF2 gene at 3p14.2 was identified in five families (2, 5, 6,
18, 23) and had a higher LOD score of 5.8 (Figure 1A-B). The FEZF2 gene encodes the
transcription factor required for the specification of corticospinal motor neurons (10, 11, 12).
Altogether, these results suggest that a founder locus that includes FEZF2 is associated with
ASD in five families.
FEZF2 sequencing revealed heterozygous deletions of 12bp in exon 2 (Figure 2A). These
mutations, either transmitted by one parent (father) for patients 32, 318 and 418 or arising de
novo for patients 36 and 323, lead to an in-frame deletion of 4 amino acids (RLPA)
(Arg237_Ala240del) in the FEZF2 protein (Figure 2B). This core region showed mammalian
conservation (Figure 2B). Interestingly, haplotype analysis indicated that this FEZF2 deletion
was found in different haplotypes (Figure 2C). In our study, both transmitted and de novo
FEZF2 mutations (n=4) were found in haplotype SQ4 that is linked to ASD in this group of
families. In haplotype SQ1, which is the most frequent, we identified one individual from
Colombia with the same RPLA mutation out of 2,535 individuals from the 1,000 genome
database (http://www.internationalgenome.org/). A similar mutation was found in three patients
with intellectual disability out of 2,379 screened Saudis and was also found as homozygous in
one autistic behavior patient (13). Their haplotype is either haplotype SQ4, SQ18 or SQ20
(Supplementary Table S3). The SQ1 (68.7%), SQ2 (8.4%) and SQ4 (5.8%) haplotypes differ

by one, two and three mutational events, respectively. Multidimensional scaling (MDS)
analysis of these FEZF2 locus haplotypes from the 1,000 genomes data indicated that the
FEZF2 alleles from Moroccan families are related to the African FEZF2 allele (Figure 2D). As
for other mutations found in brain diseases (14), one can propose that the mutation arose
independently in each case.
Brain MRI with and without contrast injection was performed for the autistic twins, 318 and 418
of Family 18, and for patient 32 of Family 2 (see Supplementary Table S1). The MRI results
did not show any significant abnormalities, and no cerebral atrophy or significant cortical
dysplasia were detected. Interestingly, the corpus callosum did not display any significant
abnormalities.

Functional analysis of the mutant FEZF2 protein in vivo in the context of neocortical
neuronal projection during embryogenesis
Supplementary Table S4
Figure 3

The FEZF2 gene (also known as FEZL, ZF312 or ZNF312) regulates the molecular identity,
dendritic development and axon targeting of layer 5 corticospinal neurons in the cerebral cortex
(10, 11, 12). TBR1 directly binds to FEZF2 regulatory regions and represses its activity in Layer
6 cortico-thalamic projection neurons to restrict the origin of the corticospinal tract to layer 5
(15, 16, 17, 18). TBR1 is one of the 20 ASD high risk candidates that confer ∼20-fold increase
in risk (5). Furthermore, cis-regulatory regions controlling the expression of FEZF2 and its
targets, such as PLEX1, display evolutionarily conserved roles in the formation of direct
corticospinal connections in primates (19, 20).
Since the FEZF2 protein is conserved from mouse to human (Percent identity: 95.22% and
Percent similarity: 95.43%) and the FEZF2 mutation involved conserved amino acids (RLPA
amino acids), we tested the function of the mutated protein in a mouse conditional Fezf2
knockout background (Supplementary Table S4).. Electroporation of either the wild-type or
mutant human FEZF2 expression constructs resulted in normal corticospinal tract projections
emanating from layer 5 (Figure 3A) indicating that expression of the FEZF2 protein with the
RPLA deletion is not sufficient to impact the long-distance axonal projection that characterizes
FEZF2-expressing cortical neurons from Layers 5 (Figure 3B). Given that FEZF2 regulates
the fate choice of subcortical projection neurons in the developing cerebral cortex (15), we next
assessed the function of the mutant FEZF2 protein in corticospinal tract development. Using
the same model as outlined above, we evidenced GFP expression in pons of electroporated
embryos that expressed the mutant FEZF2 protein similar to that previously reported in control

animals (10). These results suggest that the mutant FEZF2 protein retains its normal function,
at least in the context of corticospinal tract development and dendrite maturation, which is
consistent with the observation that the RPLA FEZF2 mutation can be found in unaffected
parents (family 2 and family 18) and is therefore not sufficient to induce an ASD phenotype
(Figure 3C).

Identification of de novo Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and Single Nucleotide Variants
(SNVs)

Supplementary Table S5
Supplementary Table S6

We first analyzed de novo CNVs in siblings from both FEZF2-allele linked and unlinked families
(Supplementary Table S5). We found 56 and 21 de novo CNVs in FEZF2-allele unlinked and
linked families, respectively. This number of de novo CNVs in our cohort (found for 11 of 11
patients) is considerably higher than the previously reported number for non-consanguineous
families (21). We analyzed these de novo CNVs using Disease Association Protein-Protein
Link Evaluator (DAPPLE) to study the gene networks involved. DAPPLE looks for significant
physical connectivity among proteins encoded by genes in loci associated with disease
according to protein-protein interactions reported in the literature (22, 23). For de novo CNVs
from FEZF2-unlinked families (N= 56), the DAPPLE network is statistically significant for
indirect connections (Seed Indirect Degrees Mean, P = 7.99 x 10

-3

and Common Interactors

Degrees Mean P = 3.99 x 10-2) (Figure 4A). In contrast, for de novo CNVs from FEZF2-linked
families (N=21), no significant network was found using DAPPLE. Interestingly, for the
DAPPLE network of FEZF2 allele-unlinked families, nodes of the gene network involve genes
encoding presynaptic proteins, synaptic receptor subunits, and adhesion molecules: PTPRD,
NSF (24, 25), GRM7, GRIK2 (26), GABRG1 (27), ROBO2 (28), EPHA7, and ALCAM (29).
DUSP22, a gene that encodes a protein activating the Jnk signaling pathway, was already
found to be mutated in another ASD study (30). To complement the DAPPLE analysis, we
used Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) from WebGestalt suite (31). ORA identified a
network that includes GRM7 and GRIK2, genes that encode synaptic proteins, thus implicating
the involvement of a GO:0007215 glutamate receptor signaling pathway (Ontology:
biological_process) with p=2.22e-16 (Cellular Component: GO:0045211: postsynaptic
membrane; p <2.22e-16; Molecular Function: GO:0008066: glutamate receptor activity; p
<2.22e-16) (Figure 4B).
We next performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in ten trios and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing eleven de novo mutations (Supplementary Table S6). We found de novo single

nucleotide variants (SNVs) in ERN1, HADHB, DMKN, and STRIP2 in three FEZF2-allele linked
patients and variants in SH3TC2, CDCA4, APOA, PHCTR3, Elf4G1, GRK4, and TMEM11
were found in five patients from FEZF2 allele-unlinked families. All variants were novel and not
observed in the exome variant server (EVS, http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/). These
variants impact amino acids conserved in mammals. This ratio of 11 protein-coding de novo
variants in our study is rather similar to that described for intellectual disability cases with de
novo variants resulting in a total of 84 de novo mutations in the protein-coding regions for 50
patients (32 ).

Analysis of de novo and transmitted CNVs and SNVs in FEZF2 allele-linked and unlinked
families
Supplementary Figure 1
Supplementary Table S7
Supplementary Table S8

Each person inherits mutations from their parents (transmitted mutations), some of which may
predispose the person to certain diseases. Meanwhile, new mutations may occur
spontaneously during the reproductive process (de novo mutations) and, if disrupting key
genes, may similarly increase the risks of disease. It is therefore important to study the
combination of de novo and transmitted mutations.
We first performed this analysis for de novo and transmitted CNVs in these 10 consanguineous
families and we found 337 and 314 genes for CNVs of FEZF2 allele-unlinked and linked
families, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). We used GO to analyze the gene networks
involved. In FEZF2 allele-linked families, we identified enrichment in GO: 0007156 biological
process: homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules and GO:
0050911: detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception of smell classes with
P=2.54 E-06 and P=1.04 E-06, respectively. In FEZF2 allele-unlinked families, we similarly found
the involvement of GO biological process GO:0007156: homophilic cell adhesion via plasma
membrane adhesion molecules with P=9.25E-08. Furthermore, DAPPLE analysis identified
statistically significant networks in FEZF2 allele-linked families (Supplementary Figure 1A)
and FEZF2 allele-unlinked families (Supplementary Figure 1B). For the FEZF2 allele-linked
families, the DAPPLE network is significant for both direct and indirect nodes (Direct Edges
Count P = 1.99 x 10-2; Seed Direct Degrees Mean P = 3.99 x 10-3; CI Degrees Mean P = 5.99
x 10-3). For the FEZF2 allele-unlinked families, the DAPPLE network is also significant for both
direct and indirect nodes (Direct Edges Count P = 3.49 x 10-2 ; Seed Indirect Degrees Mean P
= 1.99 x 10-2 ; CI Degrees Mean P=1.99 x 10-3). Interestingly, mutations found in de novo CNVs

of FEZF2 allele-unlinked families underline the importance of synaptic networks as already
reported (5, 6, 33–35). In contrast, results from transmitted and de novo CNVs of FEZF2 allelelinked and unlinked families point to distinct gene classes with adhesion proteins involved in
hemophilic interactions, such as clustered protocadherins (36, 37), that are known to be
involved in the establishment of the diversity of neural circuit assemblies and olfaction
pathways. Links between olfaction and autism were recently found in ASD patients (38, 39).
From these CNV data (Supplementary Table S5), we also analyzed genes repeatedly found
mutated in different families. We identified 207 genes mutated in more than one family (from 2
to 10 families) (Supplementary Table S7). Interestingly, their analysis by Gene Ontology
found enrichment in genes of GO: 0007156~homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane
adhesion molecules (P=1.19E-7), GO: 0098742~cell-cell adhesion via plasma-membrane
adhesion molecules (P=2.52E-7) and GO: 0050911~ detection of chemical stimulus involved in
sensory perception of smell (P=1.53E-9).
We also investigated transmitted SNVs mutations and identified 974 and 931 mutated genes
in FEZF2 allele-linked and unlinked families, respectively, with the intersection of the two
groups containing 211 genes (Supplementary Table S8). Transmitted SNVs for FEZF2 allelelinked families (N=974) display enrichment in genes of GO biological process GO:0021795
cerebral cortex cell migration (P=2.04E-05) and GO:0021885 forebrain cell migration (P=1.54E05

). In contrast, transmitted SNVs for FEZF2 allele-unlinked families (N=931) display

enrichment in genes of GO biological process GO:0007155 cell adhesion (P=1.52E-06).

FEZF2 allele-linked and unlinked families

Figure 6.

Studies leveraging the statistical power afforded by rare de novo putatively damaging variants
have identiﬁed more than 65 genes strongly associated with ASD (5, 35). The most deleterious
variants in the highest conﬁdence subset of these genes (n = 30) as a group confer ~20-fold
increase in risk (5). In four FEZF2 allele-linked families, we identified transmitted SNV
mutations in eight genes strongly associated with ASD: KAT2B , DIP2A, NINL, MFRP, AKAP9,
ASH1L, SCN2A, and ZNF559 (Figure 5). In two FEZF2 allele-linked families (Family 6 and
23), the FEZF2 mutation is a de novo mutation. In five FEZF2 allele-unlinked families, we
identified transmitted SNVs and CNV in six genes strongly associated with ASD: APH1A,
PTK7, CTTNBP2, CHD8, SETD5, and KATNAL2 (Figure 6). For both FEZF2 allele-linked and
-unlinked families, we identified an enrichment of mutations in genes strongly associated with

).

Interestingly, from the 14 mutations identified in high-risk ASD genes, thirteen are found in
transmitted SNVs and only one in a transmitted CNV (CHD8).
As mutations in ASD strongly associated genes are present in one of the unaffected parents,
one can suggest that these mutations are not sufficient to generate an ASD phenotype.
Interestingly, for FEZF2 allele-linked mutations, 1 to 3 transmitted mutations in genes strongly
associated with ASD are seen to coincide with the FEZF2 mutation (Figure 5), indicating that
a multiple hit hypothesis can be favored over the hypothesis of a single hit in a gene strongly
associated with ASD and sufficient to cause disease.

Characterization of the spatio-temporal pattern of expression of genes found mutated in our
study can give important insights into disease mechanisms. Multiple studies demonstrated
convergence of the highest-confidence non-syndromic ASD risk genes in the frontal lobe (i.e.,
prefrontal and primary motor cortex) in deep-layer projection neurons from 10 to 24 postconception weeks (PCW), or approximately spanning the end of the early fetal period and the
entire mid-fetal period (40–42).
We took advantage of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding methods by applying
BrainScope (43) to explore high-dimensional data (dual t-SNE) across multiple brain regions
and developmental periods from the BrainSpan consortium (44). With this approach, we were
able to distinguish different clusters for the 65 ASD risk genes defined by Sanders et al 2015
suggesting that they display distinct spatiotemporal trajectories (Figure 7A-B). We identified a

first group of genes (red) that clusters around FEZF2 and a second group (black) that clusters
around KATNAL2. De novo SNVs found either in FEZF2 allele-linked and unlinked families
segregated in these two different clusters.
We focused our analysis on transmitted high-risk genes and de novo SNVs identified in FEZF2
allele linked-families. In the red cluster, we identified DIP2A (Family 2), NINL (Family 6),
AKAP9 (Family 18), and ZNF559 (Family 23).In the black cluster, we identified KAT2B (Family
2), MFRP (Family 18), ASH1L and SCN2A (for Family 23); (Figure 7C). De novo SNVs in
ERN1 (Family 2) and STRIP2 (Family 6) belong to the red and black ensembles, respectively
(Figure 7 C).
Heatmap analysis of the spatiotemporal trajectories of genes displaying de novo mutations in
the ‘red’ and ‘black’ clusters revealed contrasting patterns. The pattern for the red cluster is
similar to that of FEZF2 with spatiotemporal convergence in mid-fetal deep layer (Layer 5 and
Layer 6) glutamatergic cortical pyramidal neurons (36) (Supplementary Figure 2 A and C).
In contrast, the heatmap of the black ensemble is similar to that of KATNAL2 with high levels
of postnatal expression particularly in the striatum (Supplementary Figure 2 B and D).
Multiple sequence alignment for different proteins from phylogenetically distinct species
indicated that the amino acid affected by the single nucleotide mutation was conserved through
evolution, suggesting an important function for such amino acids (Supplementary Figures 312). Interestingly, ZNF559 (Red ensemble, Family 23) is a primate-specific gene belonging to
a cluster of KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFP) genes, involved in gene regulation and is not older
than 100 million years (45) (Supplementary Figure 13). Regarding SCN2A (black ensemble,
Family 23), mice with haploinsufficiency for the gene Scn2a displayed impaired spatial memory
(46). A missense mutation, D12N, in SNC2A in the same domain as our A34T mutation (N
terminal intra-cytoplasmic domain) appears to be able to generate an ASD phenotype in
humans with functional defects of sodium channels (47). Furthermore, the product of Scn2a,
NaV1.2 is critical for dendritic excitability and synaptic function in mature pyramidal neurons in
addition to regulating early developmental axonal excitability (48). From transmitted CNVs, we
identified a mutated CHD8 gene in FEZF2 allele-unlinked family 20. This mutation involves the
full deletion of a CHD8 exon that follows the helicase domain (Supplementary Figure 14). To
further test the multiple-hit hypothesis in FEZF2 allele-linked families 2, 6, 18 and 23, we
investigated whether in all FEZF2 allele-linked families at least one of those second hits was
also expressed in FEZF2-expressing cells. For this analysis, we took advantage of single-cell
and single-nuclei data from fetal and adult human frontal cortex (49, 50). In these datasets,
FEZF2 is expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPC) and excitatory neurons (L5 in adult). All
families carried mutations in at least one gene that is expressed in the same developmental
window as FEZF2 and are also co-expressed with FEZF2 in the same cell-type (Figure 8).

The layer distribution of these genes was further assessed using the 17 human cortex sections
microarrays from (51) (Figure 9). The analysis of the relative expression of FEZF2 across
cortical sections confirmed its enrichment in layer 5. AKAP9, ASH1L and SCN2A were
relatively more expressed in deeper sections of layer 5 but, contrary to FEZF2, none of them
can be considered as significant layer specific markers in humans (51). KAT2B and DIP2A
were enriched in L6 and described as L6 markers (51) despite differences in global RPKM
(Reads Per Kilobase Million) expression levels (Supplementary Figure 15). DIP2A displays
a higher number of reads in deep layer compared to upper layer cells in the adult frontal cortex
(Figure 8). The layer differences observed in KAT2B might be contributed by glial cells (Figure
8). Independently of the degree of single-cell level expression overlap between FEZF2 and
putative second hits, none of the genes displayed the exact same cortical layer distribution of
FEZF2.

Discussion
The genetic architecture of ASDs remains to be fully understood in spite of the identification
of contributing rare and common variants (1, 2, 5). Our approach is based on the analysis of
consanguineous families from Morocco whereas most other studies involve European and/or
North American populations. The 1000 genomes project does not involve genomic data from
Northern African countries. It is important to note the high level of CNVs in the Moroccan
families analyzed in this study as compared to non-consangineous populations (21). Similar
high level of CNVs have been reported in studies involving consanguineous families, such as
in Lebanon (52).
Our aim was to test the hypothesis that a single damaging mutation in a limited set of high-risk
genes, asproposed in previous studies (5, 6, 35), can be sufficient to cause ASD. Our data
reveal a clear multi-hit organisation involving a homozygous FEZF2 allele, a damaging FEFZ2
mutation, mutations in ASD high-risk genes, and other gene variants. Each of these variants
can contribute to the genesis of an ASD phenotype. The homozygous FEZF2 allele may
possibly impact on cis elements involving deregulation of the FEZF2 gene. Such cis-regulatory
structural variants associated with autism have been recently described (53). FEZF2 is also

(55,56). The identification of a FEFZ2 mutation reported here underscores the importance of
FEZF2 in ASD genetic architecture.

Considering our multi-hit model, further work will be needed to define the relative contribution
for each mutation: the FEZF2 mutation, one to three mutations in ASD high-risk genes, and
one (or no) de novo SNVs identified in FEZF2 allele-linked families (Figure 7C). For some
ASD high-risk genes, such as CDH8, SCN2A and SERD2, their haploinsufficiency in mice is
sufficient to induce autistic-like phenotypes as demonstrated for CHD8 (57, 58), SCN2A (46),
and SETD5 (59). In our case, novel mouse models that can integrate the mutations reported
here can be instrumental to dissect the contribution of each mutation to phenotypes relevant
of ASD. Interestingly, in each FEZF2 allele-linked family we identified a mutation in a gene that
is part of the FEZF2 ‘red ensemble’ and a mutation in a gene that is part of the KATNAL2 ‘black
ensemble’ (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 2). Genes of the FEZF2 ‘red ensemble’ that
are expressed at midgestation in deep layers of the cortex may be involved in social interaction
impairment as demonstrated for CDH8 (44). In contrast, genes of the KATNAL2 ‘black
ensemble’ that are highly expressed at postnatal stages in the striatum may be responsible for
stereotypies (60, 61). How the mutations identified in FEZF2 allele-linked families contribute
to layer organisation of the human cortex can be studied using induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
(iPSCs). These pluripotent stem cells show a remarkable ability to self-organize and
differentiate in vitro in three-dimensional aggregates, known as organoids or organ spheroids,
and to recapitulate aspects of human brain development and function (62, 63). Analysis of
deep layer organization enables one to define the involvement of mutated genes discovered
in patients of FEZF2 allele-linked families.
Altogether, our results highlight the genetic architecture of ASD involving a founder mutation
that can be combined with other variants to increase the risk of ASD. We propose FEZF2 as
a novel candidate to be sequenced in ASD, particularly in at-risk consanguineous families.

Materials and Methods

Patients and Assessments
Our data set consisted of 31 individuals from 10 consanguineous Moroccan ASD families
recruited from the Child Psychiatry Center at the Arrazi Hospital (Salé –Morocco). Core
inclusion criteria for ASD individuals were as follows: (1) clinical symptoms for more than 3
years, (2) a presumptive clinical diagnosis of ASD, (3) an expert clinical determination of ASD
diagnosis based on DSM-IV criteria supported by the Autism Diagnosis Interview (ADI-R). All
patients underwent clinical and molecular evaluation including fragile X testing and karyotype
with normal results. Written informed consent was obtained from parents. Interviews of all
participants were done using a protocol approved by the ethics committee at the Faculty of
Medicine and Pharmacy in Rabat.

Phenol/Chloroform extraction. Genotyping with Affymetrix Genome Wide Human SNP Array
6.0 was performed using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, a total of 2
x 250 ng of genomic DNA was used as starting material for each enzymatic digestion (Nsp and
Sty) followed by linker-ligation of a common adaptor sequence. Standard PCR amplifies a
predictable range of fragment sizes. The target was fragmented, hybridized to microarray,
stained, and scanned. Quality controls were carried out. Affymetrix software "Genotyping
Console version 4.1" was used for genotype calling, quality control, and CNV identification.
The genotyping analysis was performed using the Birdseed v2 algorithms. The samples were
simultaneously genotyped with 90 Caucasian samples from the set of 270 HapMap individuals.
Linkage analysis was performed using the Merlin software package.
Analysis of copy number and loss of heterozygosity were performed using the BRLMM-P-Plus
algorithms. Each sample was compared to a reference file provided by Affymetrix and created
from the 270 HapMap samples. CNV calls were generated via PennCNV.

Selecting SNVs from Polyphen2 analysis
We used PolyPhen-2 that is a new development of the PolyPhen tool for annotating coding
non synonymous SNPs ((Adzhubei et al., 2010).
http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2
Our criteria were (i) to have a possibly damaging in at least one of DIV and VAR parameters
(pval <01) and (ii) to be a rare variant (frequency <0.01 in dbsnp38).

PCR amplification and sequencing
PCR amplifications were performed with 50ng of genomic DNA using Platinum Taq DNA
Polymerase (Invitrogen) and 10µM of each human FEZF2 primer. PCR products were purified
and sequenced by GATC Biotech company.

Assaying the function of the mutant 12bp deletion (d12bp) FEZF2 protein in a mouse
model of corticospinal tract development
We made a construct with the 12bp deletion of FEZF2 able to generate a FEFZF2 protein with
the RLPA deletion (see Supplementary Table S4). Both the wildtype and mutated human
FEZF2 sequences were cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCAGEN. Generation of
Fezf2 Conditional Knockout Mice Fezf2fl/fl has been described earlier (10). Briefly, E13.5
Fezf2fl/fl mouse embryos were electroporated in utero with a combination of three expression
constructs; pCAG-Cre to excise the endogenous mouse Fezf2 gene, pCALNL-GFP to visualize
transfected cells, and either pCAG-FEZF2 to express the wildtype human FEZF2 protein or
pCAG-d12bp-FEZF2 to express the mutant FEZF2 protein carrying the 12bp deletion.
Electroporations were targeted to layer 5 of the cortex. The effect on corticospinal tract
development was assessed at P0 by analysis of GFP-labelled projections in coronal brain
sections (cortex and pons, respectively).

Whole exome sequencing
We performed exome-sequencing with Illumina HISEQ using the manufacturer’s protocol.
Quality control, alignment and calling were made with GATK suite. We used a Bayesian
approach for filtering out false-positive calls. We used microarray data and exome-sequencing
calls in order to establish two classes of calls: true positive (TP) and false-positive (FP). If the
call in the microarray is equal to the call in the exome-sequencing we class it TP, otherwise
we class it FP. We classed calls by the average coverage by site, i.e. we divide by 31 (the
number of individuals) the total number of reads for a site, we separate heterozygous calls
from homozygous calls. According to DP mean and states (heterozygous or homozygous), we
constructed empirical distributions for GATK parameters and for TP and FP. We estimated a
Bayes Factor (BF) for the call and we filtered out all calls with a log(BF)<3 and read depth<20.
We used Sanger sequencing to perform validation of variants.

Networks bioinformatics analyses
We used DAPPLE and WebGestalt suites. Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator
(DAPPLE) looks for significant physical connectivity among proteins encoded for by genes in
loci associated to disease according to protein-protein interactions reported in the literature

(22). Interactions are extracted from the database “InWeb” that combines data from a variety
of public PPI sources including MINT, BIND, IntAct and KEGG and defines high confidence
interactions as those seen in multiple independent experiments. Connections can be direct
(two proteins are physically linked to each other) and indirect (interaction is mediated by a
common interactor). The non-randomness of the network and the significance of the interaction
parameters are tested using a permutation method that compares the original network with
thousands of networks created by randomly re-assigning the protein names while keeping the
overall structure (size and number of interactions) of the original network. To complement the
DAPPLE analysis, we used Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) from WebGestalt suite (31).

t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding methods
We took advantage of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding methods by applying
BrainScope (43) to explore high-dimensional data (dual t-SNE) across multiple brain regions
and developmental periods from the BrainSpan consortium (44).

Gene co-expression analysis
Cell gene counts from fetal and adult human frontal cortex were obtained from Zhong et al.
2018 and Lake et al. 2017, respectively (49, 50). Counts were log-normalized using Seurat V3
(Stuart et al. 2019) and a scale factor of 10,000. In order to calculate the proportion of cells
expressing or not expressing a given gene, a gene was considered expressed in one cell if its
normalized value was greater than or equal to 1.

Cortical layer expression
RPKM from the 17 cortical sections were obtained from He et al. 2017 (51). To represent
relative expression across sections for each gene, we scaled RPKM values to be between 0
and 1 by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum minus the minimum.

Haplotype Network reconstruction
Network reconstruction of all carrier and non-carrier haplotypes was obtained using the
median-joining algorithm implemented in NETWORK v.4.5.1 (Bandelt et al., 1999).

(A) Heterozygous deletion of 12bp in FEZF2 exon 2. Top panel: mother, middle panel: father,
lower panel: autistic child. (B) The in-frame mutation results in deletion of 4 amino acids
(RLPA) (Arg237_Ala240del). Sequence alignments of the affected FEZF2 region showed
mammalian conservation. (C) Haplotype network of the FEZF2 RLPA core region in our multiethnic panel from the 1,000 genomes data showing Saudi Arabian patients and our Moroccan
FEZF2 allele-linked ASD families. Each circle represents a haplotype, the diameter of which is
proportional to the haplotype frequency in the sample. Each line connecting two haplotypes
represents a mutational event. The RLPA mutation was found in the SQ4 (Morocco patients),
SQ2 (Saudi Arabia patients) and SQ1 (Columbian person) haplotypes. These three haplotypes
differ by one to three mutational events, suggesting a possible unique founding origin of the
RLPA mutation in FEZF2. (D) Two-dimensional plot of multidimensional scaling (MDS)
analysis of FEZF2 locus haplotypes from the 1,000 genomes data. The FEZF2 alleles from
Moroccan families are related to the African FEZF2 allele. Similarly, one of the parents from
Saudi Arabia displayed a FEZF2 allele similar to African FEZF2 alleles.

Fezf2fl/fl mouse embryos were electroporated in utero with a combination of three expression
constructs; pCAG-Cre to excise the endogenous mouse Fezf2 gene, pCALNL-GFP to visualize
transfected cells, and either pCAG-FEZF2 to express the wildtype human FEZF2 protein or

Electroporations were targeted to layer 5 of the cortex (upper panels) and at P0, in both
groups, labelled axons were seen projecting to the pons indicating normal corticospinal tract
development. The in utero electroporations were done in the same liter, on different embryos,
targetting the left hemisphere with wildtype human FEZF2 and the right hemisphere (of a

Figure 7. FEZF2 allele-linked families have a second hit from the 65 ASD risk genes
defined by Sanders et al 2015 with spatio-temporal expression trajectories similar to
that of FEZF2
A dual t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method was used to analyze the
65 ASD high risk genes defined by Sanders et al., 2015, as well as the de novo and transmitted
SNVs identified in our study. We used BrainScope (Huisman SMH et al., 2017 PMID:
28132031) to explore high-dimensional data (dual t-SNE) across developmental stages from
the BrainSpan resource (Li et al., 2018 PMID: 30545854 and www.brainspan.org). (A) With
this approach, we were able to distinguish different clusters for the 65 ASD risk genes defined
by Sanders et al. 2015 suggesting that they display distinct spatiotemporal trajectories. (B) We
identified a first group of genes (black) that clusters around KATNAL2 and a second group
(red) that clusters around FEZF2. De novo SNVs found either in FEZF2 allele-linked and –
unlinked families segregated in the different clusters. (C) Subset of the 65 ASD high-risk genes
that were found to have mutations and de novo SNVs in the different FEZF2 allele-linked
families. Genes that cluster around FEZF2 (red ensemble) are indicated in red, those that
cluster around KATNAL2 (black ensemble) are indicated in black.
