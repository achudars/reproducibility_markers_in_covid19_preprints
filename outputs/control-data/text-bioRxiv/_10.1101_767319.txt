Abstract

24

Bacterial flagella are large extracellular protein organelles that drive bacteria motility

25

and taxis in response to environmental changes. Previous research has focused mostly

26

on describing the flagellar assembly, its rotation speed and power output. However,

27

whether flagella are permanent cell structures and, if not, the circumstances and timing

28

of their production and loss during the bacterial life cycle remain poorly understood.

29

Here we used the single polar flagellum of Vibrio alginolyticus as our model and, using

30

in vivo fluorescence imaging, revealed that the percentage of flagellated bacteria (PFB)

31

in a population varies substantially across different bacterial growth phases. In the

32

early-exponential phase, the PFB increases rapidly in respect to incubation time, mostly

33

through widespread flagella production. In the mid-exponential phase, the PFB peaks

34

at around 76% and the partitioning of flagella between the daughter cells is 1:1 and

35

strictly at the old poles. After entering the stationary phase, the PFB starts to decline,

36

mainly because daughter cells stop making new flagella after cell division. Interestingly,

37

we discovered that bacteria can actively abandon flagella after prolonged stationary

38

culturing, though cell division has long been suspended. Lack of glucose was found to

39

be a major factor promoting flagellar disassembly. We also revealed that the active loss

40

of flagella was initiated by breakage in the rod connecting the extracellular filament to

41

the basal body formed by MS- and C-rings. Our results highlight the dynamic

42

production and loss of flagellar filaments during the bacterial life cycle.

45

The flagellum of a flagellated bacterium is a remarkable structure consisting of a

46

reversible rotary motor, a short proximal hook, and a thin helical filament [1]. Since the

47

flagellar system was discovered, this delicate nanomachine has attracted much research

48

and, while some aspects of the flagellar system have been well studied, others have not

49

[2-6]. Meanwhile, flagella are not only critical for bacterial motility, their constituent

50

flagellins are also important antigens that can stimulate both the innate inflammatory

51

response and the development of adaptive immunity [7-9]. Two specialized receptors

52

on immune cells, cell surface Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) [10-12] and intracellular

53

receptor Ipaf [13, 14], are responsible for recognizing flagellins as a warning of a

54

pathogenic bacterial invasion. Knowing when and how bacteria produce and lose

55

flagella, especially under stressed conditions, is valuable for understanding the way

56

bacteria either trigger or evade host immunity surveillance, a central topic in pathogen-

57

host interactions.

58

Previous research has shown that bacterial flagella are hollow protein cylinders

59

with 20 nm outer and 2 nm inner diameters [15]. A flagellum is assembled from the

60

inside out, beginning with a basal body embedded in the cell membrane and completing

61

with the structural components of the rod, hook, and filament sequentially unfolded and

62

exported by a type III secretion system [1, 16, 17]. These subunits pass through the

63

flagellum’s nascent central channel and crystallize at its tip, extending the growing

64

flagellum, which ultimately reaches about 3-10 times the length of the cell body [15].

65

Harnessing the transmembrane electrochemical proton motive force (PMF), each

66

bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) [18, 19] quickly rotates its flagellum, subsequently

propelling the bacterial cell body at a speed of 15-100 µm/s [20]. Using cutting-edge

68

biophysical methods, the torque-speed relationship [21-25], stepping [26], and

69

switching [27, 28] of the BFM have been investigated. Very recently, the dynamic

70

assembly of flagellar filaments has been characterized in real time [29-31]. However,

71

questions still remain about whether flagella are permanent structures of the cell and, if

72

not, the timing of their production and loss during different phases of the bacterial life

73

cycle remain poorly understood.

74

As for the flagellar basal structure, it is composed of the ring structures, which are

75

C-ring, MS-ring, and LP-ring, and the rod which penetrates and connects the rings [32-

76

34]. MS-ring, which is composed of ca. 30 subunits of membrane protein FliF, is

77

assembled at first in the flagellar formation [35]. C-ring, which is composed of three

78

kind proteins, FliG, FliM and FliN, is assembled beneath MS-ring to interact N-

79

terminal domain of FliG and the C-terminal domain of FliF [36, 37]. The flagellar outer

80

membrane complexes, which seems to contain LP-ring, and many incomplete flagellar

81

subassemblies have been observed by cryo-electron tomography in various bacteria [32,

82

38, 39]. The polar flagellum of Vibrio alginolyticus has extra ring structures around LP-

83

ring, called T-ring and H-ring [33, 40].

84

Using the single polar flagellum of V. alginolyticus as the model, we systematically

85

surveyed the dynamic production and loss of flagella across different growth phases of

86

the bacterial life cycle. Implementing fast fluorescent labeling and imaging, we were

87

able to track the location and timing of flagellar growth with high spatial and temporal

88

resolutions. We showed that flagella are not permanent cellular structures. Instead, the

89

probability that a cell might possess a flagellum varies substantially across different

90

growth phases. Interestingly, we revealed that bacteria can actively abandon flagella

91

after prolonged stationary culturing, and depletion of their glucose was found to be the

92

factor triggering this disassembly of flagella. Our study illustrates a dynamic allotting

93

of resources and energy for flagellar construction during the bacterial life cycle and

94

describes a new flagellar disassembly process model.

Results

97

Percentage of flagellated V. alginolyticus varies in different growth phases

98

In our experiment, an overnight culture of V. alginolyticus was diluted 1:100 and

99

continued to grow in VC growth medium. Because V. alginolyticus flagella are each

100

covered by sheath which is believed to be an extension of the bacterial cell membrane,

101

we can readily label the flagella with a lipophilic fluorescent dye (FM 4-64) and

102

visualize whether a given cell has a polar flagellum (Figure 1A) [31].

103

After growing in VC medium, a 100 μL aliquot of bacterial culture was taken from

104

the flask at an indicated time point and examined under a fluorescence microscope.

105

This procedure continued for the other indicated time points. For each, we scanned the

106

imaging field and determined the percentage of flagellated bacteria (PFB), which was

107

defined as the number of cells with fluorescent flagella divided by the total number of

108

cells examined (Figure 1A and Materials and Methods).

109

At the population level, we saw that the PFB differed greatly across different

110

phases of bacterial growth (Figure 1B). After overnight culturing, most cells lost their

111

flagella, perhaps a result of nutrient depletion in the medium, resulting in a PFB of only

112

about 10%. But, when we reinoculated the bacteria into fresh VC growth medium and

113

the subsequent bacterial growth was in its early-exponential phase (0-3 hrs of

114

incubation), the PFB increased dramatically (Figure 1B), peaking at 76% in the mid-

115

exponential phase (3-3.67 hrs of incubation). As we continued to culture the bacteria,

116

the PFB started to decline after reaching the late-exponential phase (5 hrs of incubation).

117

Once the cells began the stationary phase, the PFB dropped sharply and finally returned

118

to about 10% (Figure 1B). We confirmed the flagella lost from cell in the late-

119

exponential phase to detect the filament proteins (Fig. S1).

120

To further understand the dynamics of flagellar production and loss, we plotted the

121

PFB versus cell concentration (Figure 1C) and calculated the flagellated cell

122

concentration (cell OD × PFB) with respect to the total cell concentration (cell OD), as

123

shown in Figure 1D. Our findings indicated that in the early-exponential phase, many

124

non-flagellated cells produced new flagella, resulting in a marked increase in both the

125

PFB and flagellated cell number. In the mid-exponential phase, the PFB peaked while

126

flagellated cell numbers kept increasing. In the late-exponential phase, the PFB

127

declined while flagellated cell numbers remained constant, indicating cell division

128

without creation of new flagella. When the culture entered its stationary phase, the PFB

129

dropped further and the cells actively abandoned flagella, which was seen in the sharp

130

decline in flagellated cell number (Figure 1C, D).

alginolyticus during different growth phases. (A) A schematic illustration of the
fluorescent labeling of V. alginolyticus’s polar flagella with lipophilic fluorescent dye

relationship between the PFB and incubation time suggested that bacterial flagella are
not permanent structures of the cell. At least 300 cells were counted for each time point.
(C) The relationship between the PFB and cell concentration implied that flagellar
production and loss followed 4 different periods: rapid production, stable construction,
dilution, and active loss. (D) The sharp decline in the relationship between absolute
flagellated cell number and cell concentration indicated that flagella are widely lost in
the stationary phase. OD, optical density.

144

In the early-exponential phase flagella are widely produced

145

Following our finding that the PFB increased rapidly in the early-exponential

146

phase of bacterial growth, we examined the mechanism underlying these dynamic PFB

147

changes at the single cell level.

148

To investigate the flagellar growth pattern in this phase, we again used FM 4-64

149

to stain the flagella and conducted time-lapse recording under a fluorescent microscope.

150

Overnight, wild-type V. alginolyticus strain VIO5 was transferred into fresh VC

151

medium (see Materials and Methods) at the ratio of 1:100 for regrowth. After 0-3 hours,

152

bacteria cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope and flagellar growth was

153

recorded in real-time for 180 minutes.

154

We also constructed a VIO5 derivative strain (NMB344) that expressed enhanced

155

green fluorescent protein-fused FliG (EGFP-FliG) (see Materials and Methods) [41,

156

42]. FliG is a component protein in the part of the C-ring structure which is responsible

157

for torque generation with stator units on the basal body of the bacterial flagellar motor,

158

where the C-ring noncovalently attaches to the MS-ring. According to previous studies,

159

the C-ring must form before the flagellum can assemble [1, 43]. Therefore, using this

160

strain we can validate the production of a new flagellum by identifying a localized

161

EGFP-FliG spot at the base of the flagellum.

162

Initial microscopic observations showed that most bacteria possessed no flagella,

163

a result consistent with the population measurement. Very soon though, we saw a

164

widespread production of flagellar stubs and the PFB increased rapidly. During this

165

process, many bacterial cells without flagella became flagellated, accompanied by

166

formation of localized EGFP-FliG spots at cell poles. The appearance of flagella mostly

167

followed 2 patterns: (I) A flagellum was made at one pole of the bacterium before cell

168

elongation and division (Figure 2A, I). (II) Following cell division, a flagellum was

169

made in one daughter cell (Figure 2A, II). Both mechanisms could account for the

170

increase in the PFB and the flagellated cell number that we observed in the population

171

measurements (Figure 1C, D). Representative time-lapse images showing the

phases of its growth. (A)(D) Cartoon schematics showing different scenarios for
flagellar production. (A) I. Flagellum was made directly from one pole of the bacterium

flagellum is produced after cell division. (B)(C) In the early-exponential phase, flagella
production was prolific. (E)(F) In the mid-exponential phase, new flagella were made
at 1:1 ratio and only at the old poles during cell division. Red images showing new
flagella are of FM 4-64 dyed cells and green images of strain NMB344 cells contain

187
188

In the mid-exponential phase new flagella are made at 1:1 ratio and strictly at the

189

old poles during cell division

190

In the mid-exponential phase (3.67 hrs), the PFB peaked at about 80%. During this

191

stage, bacteria grew and divided vigorously, and most cells possessed flagella. Many

192

flagellated bacteria generated daughter cells, all with polar flagella after cell division,

193

so the PFB stayed constant at about 80% (Figure 1B). Then we studied the localization

194

and timing of newly grown flagella among different cells.

195

During bacterial cell division, each daughter cell has an old pole and a new pole.

196

The old poles existed in the mother cell prior to cell division, while the new poles form

197

only after cell division is complete. Through real-time single-cell imaging, we found

198

that new flagella were uniformly made at the old poles during cell division (Figure 2D).

199

The appearance of flagella mostly followed 2 patterns: (I) A new flagellum was made

200

at the pole opposite that of the pre-existing flagellum, then cell division soon followed

201

(Figure 2D, I). (II) Cell division first generated a daughter cell without a flagellum, but

202

a new flagellum soon formed at the cell’s old pole (Figure 2D, II). These mechanisms

203

maintained the high PFB and increased flagellated cell numbers. Representative time10

lapse images showing the production of new flagella labelled by FM4-64 and the

205

emergence of EGFP-FliG spots at flagellar bases (not on the same cell) are shown in

206

Figure 2E, F.

207

In our investigation of the temporal sequence between the production of new

208

flagella and cell division, we defined cell division completion as the time point when

209

the septum splits revealing 2 separate cells. The time when flagella growth initiates was

210

defined as the time point when a new flagellum was identified. By staining both flagella

211

and cell body, we found that new flagella could grow either before (43%) or after (46%)

212

cell division was finished (Figure 2G). However, the temporal sequence between

213

EGFP-FliG cluster assembly and cell division differed in that FliG cluster assembly

214

could occur either before (78%) or after (17%) cell division was complete (Figure 2G).

215

This observed higher percentage of FliG cluster formation before cell division agrees

216

with the fact that FliG cluster formation is a prerequisite of flagellar growth.

231

When bacterial growth entered the late-exponential phase (5 hrs), cell growth and

232

division slowed and the PFB began to decline (Figure 1B). In this phase, bacteria were

233

still dividing but the daughter cells made no new flagella, resulting in a ‘diluted’ PFB.

234

This decline in the PFB followed 2 patterns: (I) Most flagellated bacteria divided into

235

2 daughter cells, with one retaining the flagellum and the other never making a new

236

flagellum (Figure 3A, I). (II) The bacteria without flagella continued to divide and the

237

resulting daughter cells had no flagella (Figure 3A, II). Both mechanisms served to

238

decrease the PFB, but the flagellated cell number remained constant. Representative

239

time-lapse images showing the cell division of both bacteria with and without pre-

240

existing flagella (labelled by FM4-64) are shown in Figure 3B, C.

241
242

In the stationary phase, V. alginolyticus actively abandon flagellar filaments

243

When bacterial growth entered the stationary phase (7+ hrs), the bacteria’s OD was

244

basically stable, indicating that bacterial cell numbers did not increase. However, the

245

PFB continued decreasing during this phase (Figure 1B), suggesting that cell division

246

was not the only mechanism through which bacteria lose flagella.

247

Under the microscope, we observed the bacteria that had been transferred to fresh

248

VC medium at 10 hrs after overnight culture and found that bacteria that shed their

249

flagella frequently also showed no signs of growth (Figure 3D). Representative time-

250

lapse images of cells labeled with FM4-64 showing flagella loss and the disappearance

251

of EGFP-FliG spots (not on the same cell) are shown in Figure 3E, F. These phenomena

252

explained the continued PFB and flagellated cell number declines after the bacteria

253

entered the stationary phase, in which cell division had ceased.

255

Lack of glucose promotes flagellar disassembly

256

We next sought to understand what factors triggered V. alginolyticus flagellar loss

257

in its stationary phase. In the stationary phase, depleted nutrients in the growth medium

258

and accumulated metabolites may have contributed to flagellar loss. To test the

259

hypothesis that nutrient depletion precipitated active flagella abandonment, we used

260

glucose-less TMN medium supplemented with glucose of varying concentrations to

261

treat bacteria and flagellated cells were counted under a microscope. As shown in

262

Figure 4A, the PFB in a medium with no glucose decreased rapidly to 5% in 5 hrs.

263

However, the addition of 5 mM glucose slowed down the PFB drop to 30% in 5 hrs and

264

15 mM glucose was enough to stop the loss of flagella. Therefore, our results suggest

265

that glucose is important for bacterial flagella retention.

266

Besides the depletion of glucose, the accumulation of inhibitory metabolites in the

267

stationary phase might also contribute to flagella loss. So, we prepared a ‘spent’ VC

268

medium by removing bacterial cells from an overnight culture and used this supernatant

269

to culture mid-exponential phase V. alginolyticus cells. As expected, the PFB showed

270

an obvious decrease in the spent VC medium (Figure 4B); however, for cells transferred

271

to the spent VC medium supplemented with 45 mM glucose, we found that the PFB

272

would remain stable for 5 hrs before beginning a gradual decline. This indicated that

273

glucose supplementation alone was sufficient to rescue flagellar loss in the spent VC

274

medium. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the lack of a carbon source, glucose,

275

is a primary factor driving active bacterial flagella abandonment.

Fast movement of FliG clusters on the inner membrane before flagellar loss

285

To investigate the mechanics of flagellar loss in the stationary phase, we used two-

286

color imaging to simultaneously record flagellar disassembly and FliG cluster

287

movements. At first, we took time-lapse images every 20 mins to investigate whether

288

the FliG cluster stayed with the bottom of the flagellum after flagellar disassembly.

289

Interestingly, of the 72 cases of active flagella shedding we observed, in 69 cases

290

(95.83%) the EGFP-FliG cluster was missing from the base of the flagellum before the

291

flagellum detached from the cell body, while in the remaining 3 cases (4.17%) the

292

EGFP-FliG cluster stayed in the cell bodies after the flagella detached (Figure 5A, B).

293

Based on these results, we speculated 2 scenarios that may underlie the flagellar

294

disassembly process: 1) The disassembly process starts with proteolysis of the basal

295

body (C-ring), followed by MS-ring deconstruction, then flagellum detachment from

296

the cell body. 2) The disassembly process starts from breakage somewhere in the rod

the C-ring to detach.

306

To differentiate these 2 possible mechanisms, we traced the movement of EGFP-

307

FliG clusters with time-lapse imaging at 10 secs intervals during flagellar loss.

308

Surprisingly, we saw that many polar, localized FliG clusters suddenly moved (Figure

309

6A). We described this movement using a custom computer program developed to track

310

FliG cluster trajectory (see Material and Methods). Interestingly, moving FliG clusters

311

were found to travel along the periphery, not the center, of bacterial cells (Figure 6B).

312

Next, we measured the distances between mobile FliG clusters and the edges of

313

bacterial cells. The distance distribution was found to be similar to that of localized

314

FliG clusters to the edges of bacterial cells, suggesting that these mobile FliG clusters

315

were moving on the cells’ inner membranes (Figure 6C). This finding also implied that

316

flagellar loss starts with detachment, rather than destruction, of the C-ring complex.

317

Next, we plotted the mean-squared displacement (MSD) versus time interval (Δt) of

318

the mobile FliG clusters. The slope of the MSD-Δt plot confirmed that EGFP-FliG

319

clusters were highly mobile with an average diffusion constant of 9.45×10-3 μm2/s

320

(Figure 6D). In a previous study, Fukuoka et al. [44] showed that GFP–FliG clusters

321

move on the inner membrane in Escherichia coli with an average diffusion constant of

322

4.9×10-3 μm2/s, thus supporting our premise that V. alginolyticus FliG clusters also

323

move on the inner membrane before flagellar disassembly.

324

FliG is located on the cytoplasmic side of the C-ring, which is also directly

325

associated with the MS-ring component, FliF [37]. The fast movements of FliG clusters

326

that we observed suggested that the MS-ring and C-ring motor components can move

327

freely on the inner membrane, after losing the anchoring forces of the rod, P-ring, and

328

L-ring [45-47]. We further confirmed the connection between FliG movement and

329

flagella loss using two-color time-lapse imaging (Figure 6E). The results clearly

330

demonstrated that the FliG cluster definitely moves freely on the inner membrane

331

before the flagellum detaches from the cell body. Altogether, our data suggest that

332

flagellar loss is not initiated by basal body deconstruction but rather by breakage in the

333

rod component somewhere between the flagellar filament and the C-ring (Figure 7).

suddenly moved away from the pole. (B) The focal plane is kept in the middle of cells
during the tracking. Two example traces are shown here. The trajectory of a moving
FliG demonstrated that FliG clusters traveled along the periphery of bacteria, implying
that flagellar loss starts with FliG cluster removal, not FliG cluster proteolysis. None
of observed FliG traces shows crossing event through cell center. Insets: Accumulated

distance between FliG clusters and the cell edge as we keep focus on the cell middle

the distributions of distances between the edges is the same of localized FliG clusters.

Discussion

361

Using the single polar flagella of V. alginolyticus as our model, we found that the

362

PFB in a population varies substantially across different growth phases and revealed

363

that bacterial cells can stop making flagella, or even actively abandon flagella, upon

364

nutrient depletion. To discover this, we used in vivo fluorescence imaging to

365

systematically survey the dynamic production and loss of flagellar filaments, critical

366

cellular structures for bacterial motility, during the bacterial life cycle.

367

Why bacterial cells choose to dynamically produce and lose flagellar filaments

368

remains a mystery, especially since the production of flagellar filaments consumes

369

substantial amounts of protein and energy. Instead, why don’t the bacteria produce the

370

flagellar filaments, keep them as permanent cellular structures, and control when it

371

should be used/powered? Several known mechanisms enable bacteria to stop flagellar

372

rotation. For instance, under nutrient depletion, activation of cyclic di-GMP signaling

373

triggers YcgR, a c-di-GMP binding protein, to interact with the flagellar switch-

374

complex proteins FliG and FliM, stopping flagellar rotation and acting as a 'molecular

375

brake' [48, 49]. In addition, decreasing the PMF has been shown to dissociate stator

376

units from the flagellar motor, thus stopping motor rotation in E. coli. Similar

377

observations have also been found in the sodium-driven motor in V. alginolyticus [50].

378

Given these existing mechanisms that enable bacteria to stop flagellar rotation

379

without losing flagella, we were intrigued that they would actively abandon their

380

flagella, as we observed during their prolonged stationary phase. Despite a

381

comprehensive understanding of the flagellar assembly, the process of flagellar

382

disassembly remains poorly understood. For Caulobacter crescentus, flagella ejection

383

occurred during its growth cycle and previous studies showed that ejection started from

384

the inside out [51], first with digestion of the MS protein, FliF. Recently, work using

385

electron micrograph revealed that the C. crescentus disassembly product does not

386

include the C-ring, MS-ring, and export apparatus [52]. However, Ferreira et al. [39]

387

showed the ejected flagella in 5 γ-proteobacteria would leave relic structures composed

388

of the P-, L-, H-, and T-rings and the basal disk in the outer membrane. All these

389

findings came from biochemical and electron microscopic studies but lacked dynamic

390

imaging of the disassembly process. In our work, we found that flagellar ejection in V.

391

alginolyticus starts with a broken connection somewhere between the flagella and the

392

MS-ring, leading to the fast movement of FliG clusters, which differs from the ‘inside

393

out’ model of disassembly. Recently, Kaplan et al. [38] observed an inner-membrane

394

sub-complex containing the C- and MS-rings near the P- and L-ring sub-complexes in

395

many Legionella pneumophila cells. Although they explained this with a cell membrane

396

breakage event, perhaps these disassembly products resulted from a ‘break in the rod’,

397

as we observed and according to our proposed model. Furthermore, we established that

398

flagellar loss is less affected by the newly produced substances in the stationary phase,

399

but is more dependent on glucose in the medium, thus agreeing with a previous result

400

[39]. In terms of pathogen-host interaction, whether the loss of flagella due to nutrient

401

depletion would intensify or attenuate host immune response warrants continued study.

Strains and culturing

406

The V. alginolyticus wild-type strain VIO5 was used in this paper for flagellar

407

visualization and the calculation of the PFB. The green fluorescent protein-FliG

408

(EGFP-FliG) expressing strain (NMB344) was constructed from the VIO5 strain by

409

using homologous recombination with the plasmid pTSK92, a derivative of the suicide

410

vector pSW7848 [53], as described previously [54]. V. alginolyticus was grown from

411

frozen stock in VC medium (0.5% Bacto-tryptone (w/v), 0.5% yeast extract (w/v), 0.4%

412

K2HPO4 (w/v), 3% NaCl (w/v), 0.2% glucose (w/v)) for 16 hours. The cells were then

413

re-grown in VC medium after 1:100 dilution. Two motility buffers, TMN (50 mM Tris-

414

HCl (pH = 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 300 mM NaCl) and TMK (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 7.5),

415

5 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl), with selected glucose concentrations were used as non21

growing media.

417

Sample preparation

418

To visualize V. alginolyticus flagella, or FliG clusters, we constructed a micro-

419

channel chamber by using double-sided tape to affix a coverslip to a microscope slide

420

that had both been cleaned with saturated KOH solution. To immobilize cells, poly-L-

421

lysine (Sigma, 0.1%) was run through the channel, which was then washed immediately

422

with TMK medium. Then, the cells were harvested and washed with TMK by centrifuge

423

with 5500 rpm for 2 mins. Next, we added the cell suspension into the channel, allowing

424

it to sit for 10 mins before washing it with TMK to remove non-attached cells.

425

Labeling flagella and measuring the PFB

426

At a selected time point, we labeled an aliquot (100 μL) of cells with 16 μM

427

fluorescent dye FM 4-64 (T3166, ThermoFisher) in TMN. The labeled cells were then

428

loaded into the micro-channel chamber and allowed to sit 30 min to ensure that all cells

429

were immobilized on surfaces. To measure the PFB we used a Nikon Ti-E Eclipse

430

inverted microscope equipped with a 1.45 NA 100x Plan Apo lambda oil objective, an

431

sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2 plus, Andor), an LED illumination light source (pE4000,

432

CoolLED), a 530nm/30x bandpass center wavelength excitation filter, a 550nm

433

longpass center wavelength emission filter, and the Nikon Perfect Focus system.

434

Typically, we counted total 300-500 immobilized cells on both sides of the observation

435

chamber of each time points.

436

For the glucose supplementation assay, cells were re-grown for 3.5 hrs then

437

harvested by centrifuge with 5000 rpm for 10 mins. Then, the culture was incubated at

30 oC in TMN/Spent VC medium containing various glucose concentrations. Next,

439

flagella are labeled and we counted the PFB using the above PFB measurement method.

440

Time-lapse fluorescent microscopy

441

We observed time-lapse fluorescence imaging of flagella/FliG dynamics through

442

an Olympus fluorescence microscope with a 1.46 NA 100x oil objective and using the

443

Z drift compensation system at room temperature. FM4-64 was excited by a 561 nm

444

laser (OBIS 561, Coherent) and observed through a 594 nm optical filter, while EGFP-

445

FliG was excited by a 488 nm laser and observed through a 530 nm filter. The poly-L-

446

lysine coating on the coverslips of the micro-channel chambers immobilized the cells

447

and their flagella on the glass surface, enabling several hours of observation. We

448

photographed time-lapse fluorescence images with an electron-multiplying charge-

449

coupled device camera (EM-CCD, Evolve Delta, Photometrics) at 5 min or 10 min

450

intervals depending on the bacteria’s growth rate.

Analysis of FliG movement

453

We observed FliG dynamics on a Nikon Ti-E Eclipse inverted microscope which

454

is equipped with a 1.45 NA 100x Plan Apo lambda oil objective, an EM-CCD camera

455

(iXon Ultra 888-Life, Andor), an LED illumination light source (pE4000, CoolLED), a

456

470nm/20x bandpass center wavelength excitation filter, a 530nm/30x bandpass center

457

wavelength emission filter, and the Perfect Focus system. To measure cell contours, we

458

first photographed a phase-contrast image and then captured fast dynamic images of

459

FliG clusters at 250 ms exposure time each for a 3 min duration using the Nikon NIS23

460

Elements platform. Optical focus was kept in the middle plane of cells and cell contours

461

were found using phase contrast images and the Otsu algorithm.

462

For FliG spots of interest, a custom-wrote MATLAB program was used to trace the

463

spots’ trajectories. First, we subtracted the constant cell fluorescent signal to remove

464

autofluorescence signals. Then, spots on the image were fitted by 2D Gaussian

465

functions to define a center and a full width at half maximum. Finally, traces with non-

466

focus spots were discarded.

467

Detection of the filament protein from the culture supernatant

468

Overnight culture of the VIO5 cells was diluted 1:100 to the fresh VC medium,

469

and cells were regrown at 30°C. At indicated time points, absorbance of 660 nm was

470

measured and then 1 ml of the culture was aliquoted. Cells were precipitated by

471

centrifugation (16,000 x g, 5 min), and the 900 µl of culture supernatant was

472

ultracentrifuged (154,000 x g, 30 min). The pellet was suspended to the normalized

473

volume (by OD660 of the culture) in the V buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mM

474

NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2]. The pellet suspensions and whole cell lysates were analyzed

475

by SDS-PAGE followed by the immunobloting as described previously [54]. The anti-

476

polar flagellin antibody (PF42) was used to detect flagellin [55].

Fig. S1. Detection of the filament protein in the culture supernatant. VIO5
cells were grown in VC medium and 1 ml culture was aliquoted at indicated time.
Cells were precipitated by centrifugation, and then culture supernatant were
ultracentrifuged. Both pellets (low speed spin for "whole cell lysate" and
ultracentrifugation for "culture supernatant") were suspended to the normalized
volume (equivalent to OD660 of 10) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by
immunoblotting. (A): analysis of whole cell lysate, (B): analysis of culture
supernatant. Left panels show anti-flagellin immunoblot, and right panels show
Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gel. Polar flagellin is indicated
by the arrow head.
