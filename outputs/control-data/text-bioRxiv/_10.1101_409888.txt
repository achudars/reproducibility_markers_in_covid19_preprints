Abstract:

16

The origins of multicellular physiology are tied to evolution of gene expression. Genes

17

can shift expression as organisms evolve, but how ancestral expression influences altered

18

descendant expression is not well understood. To examine this, we amalgamated 1,903

19

RNA-seq datasets from 182 research projects, including 6 organs in 21 vertebrate species.

20

Quality control eliminated project-specific biases, and expression shifts were

21

reconstructed using gene-family-wise phylogenetic Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models.

22

Expression shifts following gene duplication result in more drastic changes in expression

23

properties. The expression properties were tightly coupled with protein evolutionary rate,

24

depending on whether and how gene duplication occurred. Fluxes in expression patterns

25

among organs were nonrandom, forming modular connections which were reshaped by

26

gene duplication. Thus, if expression shifted, ancestral expression in some organs induces

27

a strong propensity for expression in particular organs in descendants. This supports a

28

major role for what might be termed “preadaptive” pathways of gene expression evolution.

Introduction:

31

Vertebrate organs organize physiological activities, and their identities and functions

32

are determined by the diverse expression patterns of thousands of genes. Because of this,

33

the evolution of gene expression patterns plays a central role in organismal evolution.

34

The degree of organ expression specificity correlates to how fast amino acids substitute

35

(Zhang and Li, 2004), how rapidly they change expression levels (Liao and Zhang, 2006),

36

and patterns of histone modifications (She et al., 2009). Major organ-altering

37

evolutionary events such as development of the hominoid brain are also associated with

38

gene expression shifts (Chen et al., 2013; Kaessmann, 2010; Zhang and Long, 2014;

39

Zhang et al., 2011). However, although gene duplication is well-known to play an

40

important role in expression pattern shifts (see e.g. the “ortholog conjecture” (Altenhoff

41

et al., 2012; Castillo-Davis et al., 2004; Chen and Zhang, 2012; Rogozin et al., 2014)),

42

the evolutionary dynamics of expression patterns with and without gene duplication

43

remain poorly understood. An important question is whether long-term expression in one

44

organ predisposes genes to be subsequently utilized in other organs.

45

A theoretical basis for such predisposition may be the idea that certain pre-existing

46

adapted states are more conducive to evolution of specific new traits than other pre-

47

existing states. This is known as preadaptation, and when a trait makes such a shift it is

48

referred to as exaptation (Gould and Vrba, 1982). Evidence for preadaptation was long

49

ago found in phenotypic traits (Budd, 2007), and recently in molecular traits such as

50

protein sequences during de novo gene birth (Wilson et al., 2017) or during functional

51

innovations (Starr et al., 2017). Protein sequence evolution generally involves highly

52

epistatic interactions and context-dependent changes (Podgornaia and Laub, 2015; Starr

53

et al., 2017) that affect preadaptation, but the modular nature of expression regulation

54

(de-Leon and Davidson, 2007) makes it unclear whether preexisting expression patterns

55

constrain evolutionary outcomes. By analyzing such influences on a genome-wide scale

56

in this study, we aim to contribute some evidence towards this question.

57

Evolution of gene expression has been studied at genome-wide scales mainly using

58

two distinct approaches: phylogenetic and pairwise analyses. Phylogenetic approaches

59

model gene expression dynamics and infer ancestral expression patterns in the context of

60

gene phylogenies. For example, Brownian motion models embody purely neutral

61

expression evolution (Bedford and Hartl, 2009), whereas Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models are

62

designed to detect purifying selection and adaptive evolution along with neutral

63

fluctuation (Brawand et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2019; Rohlfs et al., 2014). Although each

64

gene family has a distinct evolutionary history, a species phylogeny is often used for the

65

sake of simplicity. Because such approximations cannot be applied to gene families with

66

lineage-specific gene duplications and losses, its application has mostly been limited to

67

single-copy genes. In contrast, pairwise analysis compares gene expression between

68

paralogs in single species (Assis and Bachtrog, 2015; Lan and Pritchard, 2016) or

69

between orthologs or paralogs in pairs of species (Chen and Zhang, 2012; Guschanski et

70

al., 2017; Kryuchkova-Mostacci et al., 2016; Rogozin et al., 2014; Warnefors and

71

Kaessmann, 2013). Although pairwise approaches can evaluate the effect of gene

72

duplications, ancestral expression cannot be inferred.

73

To infer the adaptive evolution of gene expression in diverse gene families, we

74

applied Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models for complex gene family phylogenies containing

75

gene duplications and losses, without assuming species phylogeny. We also developed a

76

curation pipeline to amalgamate large amounts of transcriptome data from many studies

77

for a better phylogenetic resolution. Using these methods, we ask how expression changes

78

link to gene duplication and the rate of protein evolution, and whether previous patterns

79

of gene expression constrain later evolution, what we will call the “preadaptation

80

hypothesis”.

Results:

83
84

Duplication-permissive genome-wide analysis of gene families. To allow evolutionary

85

expression analysis on a broad set of genes, we used a phylogenetic approach that deals

86

with the complex history of gene family trees with duplications and losses, and applied it

87

to 21 tetrapod genomes (Fig. S1). A major challenge in using gene trees was divergence

88

time estimation, a prerequisite for applying phylogenetic comparative methods. We

89

overcame this problem by incorporating phylogeny reconciliation in estimating

90

divergence time of gene trees. Gene divergence nodes were constrained by the

91

corresponding divergence times in a known species tree, and duplication nodes were

92

constrained by ancestral and descendant speciation events (see Materials and Methods for

93

details). Because we estimated individual gene phylogenies rather than using a single

94

species phylogeny, we could analyze gene families that included many lineage-specific

95

gene duplications and losses, making our study less biased towards conserved genes with

96

slow gene turnovers (Guschanski et al., 2017). Use of gene family trees also allowed us

97

to include many organ-specific genes that are enriched in lineage-specific and young

98

duplications (Guschanski et al., 2017). There were only 1,377 single-copy orthologs for

99

which the species phylogeny was applicable, but we were able to include 15,475 genes

100

per species on average (including 20,873 human genes, merged into 15,280 gene families).

101

This approach eliminates problems with pairwise analyses that ignore phylogenetic tree

102

structure, and allowed us to infer expression at ancestral nodes in the tree.

103
104

Transcriptome amalgamation. To attain high resolution in our analyses, we

105

amalgamated 1,903 RNA-seq experiments from 182 research projects (i.e., 182

106

BioProject IDs in the NCBI SRA database) and generated a dataset covering 6 organs

107

from 21 vertebrate species without missing data (Tables S1–S2; Fig. S1). In comparison,

108

other recent comparative transcriptomic analyses of vertebrates (Barbosa-Morais et al.,

109

2012; Breschi et al., 2016; Carelli et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2019; Cortez et al., 2014;

110

Guschanski et al., 2017; Julien et al., 2012; Necsulea et al., 2014; Warnefors and

111

Kaessmann, 2013) often used the same dataset containing 131 RNA-seq experiments

112

from 6 organs and 10 species (Brawand et al., 2011), with some additional data in

113

different studies. RNA-seq reads were first mapped to corresponding reference genomes

114

and then the expression level was quantified by two metrics: transcripts per million

115

(TPM) and fragments per kilobase million normalized by trimmed mean of M-values

116

(Robinson and Oshlack, 2010) (TMM-FPKM). To reduce the among-species variation,

117

the TMM normalization was applied across all 1,903 samples using the 1,377 single-copy

118

orthologs.

119

To allow rapid integrated analysis of datasets, we employed automated multi-aspect

120

quality controls, including metadata curation (Table S3), sequence read filtering (Fig. S2),

121

and iterative removal of anomalous RNA-seq samples by monitoring correlations

122

between and within data categories (Fig. 1A; Fig. S3). The metadata curation enabled us

123

to select appropriate samples from the NCBI SRA database. Data that were not

124

compatible with those from other research projects (defined by BioProject ID) were

125

removed in the correlation analysis by implementing a majority rule (Table S3), resulting

126

in a cleaned dataset. This filtering step was designed to fulfill the assumption that any

127

samples from the same organ should correlate better than samples from different organs

128

within species. When anomalous data were detected, all samples belonging to the same

129

research projects (i.e., the same BioProject ID) were discarded.

130

Finally, we applied surrogate variable analysis (SVA) (Leek and Storey, 2007) to

131

detect and correct hidden biases likely originating from heterogeneous sampling

132

conditions and sequencing procedures among experiments in both log2-scaled TPM and

133

TMM-FPKM (SVA-log-TPM and SVA-log-TMM-FPKM, respectively; Fig. S4A–B).

134

This correction greatly improved the correlation of expression levels within organs from

135

the same species, even when data were derived from different research projects (Fig. 1B–

136

C; Fig. S4C–F). Among surrogate variables, BioProject IDs tend to show a high

137

predictive power, suggesting project-specific sources of bias (Fig. 1D; Fig. S4G–H).

138

Although the inclusion of many species from phylogenetically diverse lineages makes it

139

difficult to extract organ-wise characteristics from the limited number of single-copy

140

orthologs, a principal component analysis produced moderate organ-wise segregation in

141

the multispecies comparison (Fig. 1E; Fig. S4I–K), further indicating that the curated

142

dataset is sufficiently reliable for use in cross-species expression pattern analyses. The

143

previously-reported uniqueness of testis transcriptomes (Brawand et al., 2011) was partly

144

resolved as the third principal component (Fig. S4K).

145

In addition to the better phylogenetic coverage, greater accuracy of estimated

146

expression levels is another possible advantage of integrating many RNA-seq datasets.

147

This idea is supported by subsampling analysis on a housekeeping gene GAPDH

(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), where, as more data are used, estimated

149

expression levels tend to quickly converge to a final value (Fig. 1F; Fig. S4L).

150
151

Modeling expression evolution. We next used the amalgamated transcriptomes to

152

evaluate how expression evolved along 15,280 maximum-likelihood gene family

153

phylogenies (Table S4), employing multi-optima Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) models

154

(Hansen, 1997) to allow for possible adaptive shifts of optimal expression levels and

155

neutral fluctuations (Brawand et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2019; Rohlfs et al., 2014). This

156

modeling identified statistically supported expression ‘regime shifts’ (Hansen, 1997;

157

Khabbazian et al., 2016) on each gene tree (Fig. 2A), which were then analyzed in the

158

context of preceding duplication events. ‘Speciation’ events (S node; Fig. 2B) with no

159

duplication were considered the ‘baseline’ mode of expression evolution because

160

regulatory environments and expression patterns are more preserved among orthologous

161

genes in comparison with paralogous genes produced by gene duplication (Altenhoff et

162

al., 2012; Castillo-Davis et al., 2004; Chen and Zhang, 2012; Rogozin et al., 2014).

163

Because OU shift detection has been applied for gene expression by assuming species

164

tree phylogeny in single-copy genes, shifts in S branches are equivalent to those

165

characterized previously (Brawand et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2019) but also includes many

166

more speciation events in duplication-prone gene families. Gene tree nodes associated

167

with preceding duplication events were categorized as DNA-based duplication or

168

retrotransposition (D or R nodes, respectively) depending on intron losses (Fig. 2B).

169

Organ-wise means of the two expression values, SVA-log-TPM and SVA-log-

170

TMM-FPKM, were separately used to model expression evolution with OU processes.

171

The two analyses resulted in similar numbers and characteristics of expression regime

172

shifts (Fig. S5), but the shift locations were sometimes inconsistent. S branches were a

173

major source of apparently inconsistent regime shifts, whereas branches following

174

duplication (D and R) showed largely consistent detection between the two metrics (Fig.

175

2C). Although the inclusion of inconsistently detected branches did not change the results,

176

we retained only consistently detected regime shifts for all downstream analysis to draw

177

a more robust conclusion. While SVA-log-TMM-FPKM values were reported in the main

178

text unless otherwise mentioned, the comparisons with SVA-log-TPM-based analyses are

179

available as Supplementary Information.

180

As an example of this analysis, an orthogroup of phosphoglycerol kinases (PGKs),

181

containing all three categories of branching events followed by expression shifts (S, D,

182

and R), is shown in Fig. 2D. This protein catalyzes the first ATP-generating step in the

183

glycolytic pathway and is required for most cell types including sperms (Danshina et al.,

184

2010; Liu et al., 2015). PGK1, the original copy on the X chromosome, is known to have

185

duplicated independently in eutherians and marsupials to produce the autosomal

186

retrocopy PGK2 that compensates the protein activity during X-inactivation (Boer et al.,

187

1987; McCarrey and Thomas, 1987; Potrzebowski et al., 2008). Our automated analysis

188

correctly recovered both retrotranspositions as well as the subsequent gains of testis-

189

specific expression in eutherian and marsupial lineages. This illustrates that our

190

automated genome-wide analysis can recover evolutionary trajectories that are

191

compatible with focused single gene family analyses (see Supplementary Data for

192

individual gene trees).

193
194

Duplication-specific effects in expression evolution. Across gene trees, expression

195

regime shifts were relatively rare in S branches, for a probability of 2.2% per branch, and

196

an average rate of 5.1×10-4 shifts/MY (million years) (Fig. 3A–B). In agreement with

197

the idea that gene duplication tends to free genes up for functional divergence and

198

enhance long-term retention of duplicated copies (Assis and Bachtrog, 2015; Huerta-

199

Cepas et al., 2011), the frequency of regime shifts in D branches was four times as much

200

per branch (9.0% per branch, at a rate of 1.9×10-3 shifts/MY across all genes and all D

201

branches). Thus, although far fewer branches are preceded by DNA-based duplication

202

events (72,476 branches) than speciation events (556,240 branches), D branches account

203

for over 33% of all regime shifts consistently detected by the two expression measures.

204

We note that this result reinforces previous results on the “ortholog conjecture”, the idea

205

that duplicated gene copies (paralogs) are more prone to expression shifts than orthologs

206

(Altenhoff et al., 2012; Castillo-Davis et al., 2004; Chen and Zhang, 2012; Rogozin et al.,

207

2014). R branches were far more likely to result in expression regime shifts (37.3% per

208

branch, at a rate of 7.6×10-3 shifts/MY), but with only 2,985 R branches, this resulted in

209

only 1,107 shifts (5.6% of the total). Translocated genes are more likely to shift

210

expression than those that do not (Fig. S6), in line with previous observations from the

211

human genome (Lan and Pritchard, 2016). While the expression shift frequency in S and

212

D branches varies slightly across the phylogeny, R branches showed much stronger

213

among-lineage heterogeneity, and had a particularly high frequency in the mammalian

214

lineage (Fig. 3B). These retrotransposition-related expression changes may be related to

215

the variation in the retrotransposition rate itself, which is known to vary across lineages

216

(Marques et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2007). Among-species heterogeneity in gene prediction

217

quality may also be attributed to this pattern. In the absence of regime shifts, expression

218

levels varied most in ovary and testes, which had significantly higher average stationary

219

variances than the other four organs on the basis of tree-wise stationary variance (Fig.

220

3C). This supports previously observed high variation of gene expression in testes

221

(Brawand et al., 2011) and extends it to the reproductive organs of both sexes.

222

If expression regime shifts are due to functional divergence, it is highly relevant to

223

characterize how expression properties changed from ancestral to derived regimes. To do

224

this, we examined changes in organ expression specificity, maximum expression level,

225

and organ expression complementarity. The specificity measure τ ranges from 0 for

226

uniformly expressed genes to 1 for genes with highly specific expression (Yanai et al.,

227

2005). The distributions of regime shifts in D and R branches are shifted towards greater

228

organ specificity compared to shifts in S branches, with R branches creating the most

229

specific expression (Fig. 3D). To characterize the ‘on state’ transcriptional activity, we

230

analyzed the maximum fitted expression levels among the six organs (μmax). D and R

231

branches appear to be enriched for down-regulation compared to S branches (Fig. 3E).

232

Complementarity of organ expression patterns was measured to evaluate the

233

differentiation between a pair of sister branches. We used a metric on the fitted organ-

234

wise expression levels (μ) called ‘TEC’, which ranges from 0 for completely overlapping

235

expression to 1 for mutually exclusive patterns (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2011), Nearly all

236

branches with regime shifts (95%) had complementarity values greater than 0.5,

237

indicating that most regime shifts detected involve differentiation of expression patterns,

238

rather than overall up- or down-regulation. Regime shifts in D and R branches often had

239

more complementarity expression than those in S branches (Fig. 3F), further supporting

240

the role of gene duplication in functional differentiation. The more drastic effect in R

241

branches probably reflects the regular loss of regulatory elements in retrotranspositions,

242

whereas DNA-based duplication can more often retain regulatory regions (Babushok et

243

al., 2007). Jointly, these results indicate that, compared with the baseline from speciation-

244

associated shifts, gene duplication tend to produce more organ-specific, more often down-

245

regulated, and more differentiated expression patterns. Although the down regulation

246

may be explainable by a tendency to need less of the newly functional expression regime,

247

it may also be explained by either recent nonfunctionalization (Balakirev and Ayala,

248

2003; Mighell et al., 2000) or specialized expression in organs that were not part of this

249

analysis.

250
251

Context-dependent change in the rate of protein evolution. Change in gene expression

252

can be accompanied by accelerated or decelerated protein evolution, which may be

253

detected by change in the ratio of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitutions (dN/dS or

254

ω) along branches. In D and R branches, median ω values are more than double the

255

baseline seen in S branches (Fig. 4A; Fig. S7A), again supporting the ortholog conjecture

256

and the idea that gene duplication tends to free genes up for functional divergence (Assis

257

and Bachtrog, 2015; Huerta-Cepas et al., 2011). Within each of S, D, and R branch

258

categories, branches with expression regime shifts accompany an increased ω compared

259

to sister branches (Fig. 4A). The increased rate was quite small in S branches (median ω,

260

0.096 in branches with shifts versus 0.102 in sister branches), much bigger in D branches

261

(0.182 versus 0.244), and huge in R branches (0.036 versus 0.394). If the changes in

262

expression and the rate of protein evolution are due to functional changes, this may

263

indicate that functional divergence is sometimes effected by joint changes in expression

264

and accelerated protein evolution.

265

Although 52.3% of all branches with expression regime shifts had higher ω relative

266

to sister branches (ω ratio), 27.5% of sister branch pairs are relatively undifferentiated,

267

with differences in ω within ± 5%, and 42.5% had lower ω in the branches with

268

expression shifts. This finding led us to hypothesize that the direction of the rate changes

269

in protein evolution is linked to how, rather than whether, expression is changed.

270

Strikingly, we found a context-dependent association between protein and expression

271

evolution (Fig. 4B; Fig. S7B). Increased ω ratio was linked strongly to increased, rather

272

than decreased, organ expression specificity in S and D branches, potentially reflecting

273

adaptive evolution coupled with specialized expression. However, it was in turn highly

274

associated with decreased specificity in R branches, which may be explained by frequent

275

gene decay in unsuccessful retro-copies. The change in maximum expression level was

276

overall negatively correlated with ω ratio, but this link was stronger in down-regulation

277

compared with up-regulation, except for D branches where the ω ratio was smaller when

278

Δμmax was larger (Fig. 4B). It has been reported that high expression slows protein

279

evolution (Zhang and Li, 2004), and our results suggest that DNA-based duplication

280

creates such constraints when accompanied by up-regulation. The organ expression

281

complementarity between sister lineages was positively correlated with ω ratio (Fig. 4B),

282

and its association was strongest in R branches, suggesting that protein evolution

283

accelerates as gene expression patterns differentiate from their ancestral state.

284

Collectively, these results suggest that protein evolution rate is linked to changes in

285

expression properties through a complicated association, which masks their relationships

286

in a global, unstratified analysis, and potentially explain a previous report of no strong

287

relation (Warnefors and Kaessmann, 2013).

288
289

Organ-specific propensity in gene expression evolution. The preadaptation hypothesis

290

predicts that the ancestral organ expression prior to the shifts will affect which organs are

291

likely to become the target of newly specific expression. To assess this, we tested whether

292

expression shifts are random with respect to change in expression from one organ to

293

another, by characterizing the organ in which genes are most highly expressed (PEO,

294

primary-expressed organ).

295

Across vertebrates, switching from one PEO to another was detected in 6,886, 3,586,

296

and 746 regime shifts in S, D, and R branches, respectively. The gain/loss ratios are

297

heterogeneous among organs (Fig. 5A), suggesting that vertebrate organs serve as both

298

sources and sinks in expression evolution, but that their relative contributions are organ-

299

specific. Although S, D, and R branches shared a global trend of relatively abundant

300

testis-related PEO shifts, their distributions are largely different. D branches were

301

moderately similar to both S and R branches (Spearman’s ρ ~ 0.6), but S and R branches

302

were dissimilar (ρ = 0.28). This result suggests a role for gene duplication, including by

303

retrotranspositions, in remodeling the among-organ flow of expressed genes.

304

Controlling the total number of shifts from and to each PEO, some PEO shifts are

305

significantly different from the random expectation (Fig. 5B). There are clear patterns of

306

evolutionary transitions that are statistically supported by independent OU modeling of

307

the two expression metrics. In S branches, the pairs of brain–testis and testis–ovary

308

showed strong connections, indicating a solid exchange module. Kidney and liver also

309

donate genes to one another, forming a separate module from brain–testis–ovary. D and

310

R branches showed a pronounced acceleration of PEO shifts between testis and ovary.

311

PEO shifts in S and D branches were moderately symmetric in the flow between pairs of

312

organs (Fig. 5C), meaning two organs tend to donate comparable numbers of expressed

313

genes each other. In contrast, R branches were more asymmetric. The lower symmetry

314

may have perturbed the evolutionary dynamics of gene expression.

315

To check the robustness of our analysis, we analyzed high-confidence subsets of

316

expression regime shifts. The most drastic expression changes were characterized by

317

introducing a cutoff of organ expression specificity (τ > 0.5) to define organ-specific

318

genes. Although some previously significant trends were not recovered due to small

319

sample sizes, the result was largely consistent with the broader analysis (Fig. S8). Because

320

tree inference errors can bias the downstream analysis including OU modeling, we also

321

analyzed expression regime shifts found in clades which have a high support in tree

322

inference (>99% bootstrap support). Again, the results were largely consistent (Fig. S8).

323

Especially, the brain–testis–ovary and kidney–liver modules in S branches and the testis–

324

ovary connection in D and R branches were always reproduced in the analyses with above

325

thresholds in combinations with the two expression metrics (SVA-log-TMM-FPKM and

326

SVA-log-TPM; Fig. S8), demonstrating the robustness of our conclusion.

327

To obtain insight into the biological relevance of the among-organ modules, we

328

characterized human genes involved in PEO shifts from all branch categories using

329

the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis.

330

The genes descended from the testis–ovary PEO shifts enriched only one KEGG pathway

331

term “Cell cycle” (Table S5; adjusted P value < 0.05), likely reflecting their function in

332

meiosis. Although the adjusted P value was not statistically significant, it is noteworthy

333

that the top-ranked term for the brain–testis connection was “Endocrine and other factor-

334

regulated calcium reabsorption” annotated to four genes including GNAQ, which has

335

been implicated to tumor formation in neuronal tissues (Gessi et al., 2013; Van

336

Raamsdonk et al., 2009). In the kidney–liver module, 15 terms were significantly

337

enriched, many of which appear to be related to the functions and diseases in those organs,

338

for example, “Bile secretion”, “Phagosome”, “Lysosome”, “ABC transporters”,

339

“Sphingolipid metabolism”, and “Type I diabetes mellitus” (Table S5). These results

340

suggest that the among-organ modules in the PEO shifts played a role in supplying

341

functionally important genes.

342

Because ancestral expression was shown to orient new expression by the analysis of

343

PEO shifts, we concluded that there was prevalent organ-specific propensity, which

344

supports the presence of preadaptation in gene expression.

345
346

Discussion:

347

Our results suggest that the landscape of expression evolution is strongly shaped by

348

mechanisms of gene birth. Patterns of PEO shifts depend on ancestral states, suggesting

349

preadaptation in the evolution of vertebrate gene expression. However, the mechanisms

350

responsible for the propensity are unknown. Part of the propensity can be explained by

351

the “out of the testis” hypothesis, which explains the accelerated gains of testis expression

352

based on the permissive chromatin state, abundant transcriptional machinery, relatively

353

simple promoters required for the expression in spermatogenic cells and following gains

354

of new expression patterns (Kaessmann, 2010; Kleene, 2005). This theory fits to the

355

accelerated testis-related PEO shifts, but the other detected patterns (e.g., kidney–liver

356

module) require a different view.

357

One potential cause is a ‘regulatory’ mechanism whereby frequent gene-exchanging

358

organs use similar sets of regulatory elements. Altered expression between such organs

359

could occur with relatively few mutations in regulatory sequences. Cis-regulation is

360

indeed a major source of expression evolution, as it explains a certain fraction of

361

expression variability, for example, in budding yeast (30% in duplicates and 19% in

362

singletons) and undergoes a more rapid divergence than trans-regulation (Dong et al.,

363

2011). Another hypothetical ‘coding’ mechanism is that frequently interacting organs

364

may have similar environmental requirements for expressed proteins, such that few amino

365

acid substitutions tend to be required to adjust biochemical properties. Protein reusability

366

may be determined by cellular environments such as pH and temperature or by functional

367

categories of proteins. Our analysis indicates that the regime shifts that drastically

368

differentiate the expression tend to be coupled with accelerated protein evolution (Fig.

369

4B), and this result can be viewed as a support for the act of ‘coding’ mechanism. The

370

‘regulatory’ and ‘coding’ hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and both factors may

371

contribute to generate preadaptive patterns of gene expression.

372

In this study, we established a method to standardize RNA-seq data from disparate

373

research projects and developed a pathway for data amalgamation. By reconstructing

374

gene expression in tailored gene family phylogenies, our analysis revealed non12

375

randomness and directionality of expression evolution. This suggests prevalent

376

preadaptation in gene expression, that adaptation to expression in certain organs is more

377

conducive to future expression in other organs, and shows how gene duplication helped

378

to reshape the dynamics of expression evolution that contributed to the vertebrate

379

diversification.

381

Materials and Methods:

382
383

Species selection. A total of 105 species included in the Ensembl release 91 (Yates et al.,

384

2016) were searched for data availability in the NCBI SRA database (Leinonen et al.,

385

2011) (final search on May 1, 2018) and 22 species were found to have RNA-seq data for

386

6 organs: brain, heart, kidney, liver, ovary, and testis. Lepisosteus oculatus was excluded

387

due to an insufficient quality of available expression data, and therefore remaining 21

388

species were selected for further analysis.

389
390

Species tree. The dated species tree for the 21 species was retrieved from TimeTree

391

(Hedges et al., 2006) (downloaded on March 15, 2018; Supplementary Data). Some

392

species were unavailable in the database and therefore they were temporarily replaced by

393

closely related species to obtain the dated species tree.

394
395

Transcriptome metadata curation. We developed an automated python program for

396

SRA metadata curation (Table S3; Supplementary Data). RNA-seq data were selected

397

from the NCBI SRA database by keyword searches limited to the 21 species, the 6 organs,

398

and Illumina sequencing platforms. Orthographical variants of annotations were

399

standardized with keyword libraries created by manually checking the original

400

annotations. Prenatal or unhealthy samples and small-scale sequencing samples (<5

401

million reads) were excluded. Data for non-messenger RNA sequencings were also

402

removed. In treatment and control RNA-seq pairs, only control experiments were

403

included.

404
405

Transcriptome quantification. Fastq files were extracted from downloaded SRA files

406

using parallel-fastq-dump 0.6.2 (https://github.com/rvalieris/parallel-fastq-dump) with

407

the minimum read length of 25 bp and the quality filter (-E option) (Leinonen et al., 2011).

408

The fastq sequences were then subjected to a quality filtering by fastp 0.12.3 (Chen et al.,

409

2018). The filtered reads were mapped to genomic features annotated as non-messenger

410

RNAs in the Ensembl GTF files using bowtie2 2.3.4 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and

411

resultant unmapped reads were used for expression level quantification using kallisto

412

0.43.1 with the sequence-based bias correction (Bray et al., 2016). Samples were removed

413

if 20% or smaller percentages of reads were mappable (Fig. S2). Estimated mapped read

414

counts and transcript lengths were used to calculate TPM and FPKM values. For the latter,

415

the “trimmed mean of M-values (TMM)” normalization method was applied (Robinson

416

and Oshlack, 2010). Sample-wise TMM scaling factors were obtained across all RNA-

417

seq samples using the FPKM values of 1,377 single-copy orthologs. Because TMM and

418

TPM transformations are incompatible with each other, the TMM scaling was applied

419

only to FPKM values. TPM and TMM-FPKM values were subsequently transformed to

420

𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑁 + 1) values (log-TPM and log-TMM-FPKM, respectively). Paralogous genes that

421

haven’t diverged in their nucleotide sequences could not be distinguished well in the

422

quantification step. Although our scope is to characterize gene expression in the timescale

423

of vertebrate evolution, this difficulty likely leads to an underestimation of expression

424

regime shifts in young duplicates.

425
426

Iterative anomalous sample removal coupled with surrogate variable analysis.

427

Anomalous RNA-seq samples were iteratively removed by a correlation analysis coupled

428

with an expression bias correction. In each iteration, unwanted biases in expression level

429

were removed by surrogate variable analysis (SVA, ‘sva’ function in an R package ‘sva’)

430

(Leek and Storey, 2007). SVA analysis was applied at the beginning of each iteration so

431

that it is not influenced by anomalous samples removed in previous iterations.

432

Subsequently, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated for every RNA-seq data

433

against mean expression level in each organ generated by averaging all other data

434

excluding those from the same BioProject (Fig. S3). We assume that the sample’s

435

correlation coefficient against the same organ is higher than any of the values against the

436

other organs, and we removed all samples from the same BioProject when violations were

437

found. These steps were repeated until no violations were left and SVA-corrected

438

expression levels were finally reported (SVA-log-TMM-FPKM and SVA-log-TPM). The

439

curation steps were skipped if multiple samples were unavailable in the species and hence

440

SVA analysis was inapplicable. The final dataset was comprised of 1,903 RNA-seq

441

experiments from 182 BioProjects that cover 6 organs from 21 vertebrate species without

442

missing data (Tables S1–S2).

443
444

Orthogroup classification. Orthogroups, which contain all genes descended from one

445

gene in the common ancestor, were inferred from coding sequences of the 21 species

446

using OrthoFinder 2.1.2 (Emms and Kelly, 2015) guided by the species tree. In total,

447

17,896 orthogroups were generated. The largest orthogroup, which is comprised of 7,893

448

olfactory receptor genes, was removed from the analysis because of computational

449

burden. After sequence alignment processing (see “Multiple sequence alignment”), we

450

removed small orthogroups which retained less than four genes and orthogroups that

451

showed no parsimony informative sites, because phylogenetic relationships cannot be

452

inferred. As the result of filtering, 15,280 orthogroups were left for OU modeling, with

453

the largest one containing 3,796 zinc-finger proteins (Table S4).

454
455

Multiple sequence alignment. Multiple fasta files containing coding sequences were

456

generated for each orthogroup. Stops and ambiguous codons were masked as gaps (for

457

implementation, see https://github.com/kfuku52/cdskit). In-frame multiple codon

458

sequence alignments were generated using MAFFT 7.394 with the ‘auto’ option (Katoh

459

and Standley, 2013) and tranalign in EMBOSS 6.5.7.0 (Rice et al., 2000). Anomalous

460

genes were excluded by MaxAlign (Gouveia-Oliveira et al., 2007) which decreased the

461

largest orthogroup size from 3,796 to 2,382 genes. Spurious codons were removed in-

Gene tree reconstruction. Maximum-likelihood trees were reconstructed using IQ-

467

TREE 1.6.5 (Nguyen et al., 2015) with the best-fit nucleotide substitution models selected

468

by ModelFinder with the Bayesian Information Criterion (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017).

469

Larger orthogroups and longer genes tended to fit more complex substitution matrices

470

and larger numbers of categories of rate heterogeneity (Fig. S9A–B; Table S4). Ultrafast

471

bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates was performed to evaluate the credibility of tree

472

topology (Minh et al., 2013) with a further optimization of each bootstrapping tree (-bnni

option) (Hoang et al., 2018).

with the default parameters (duplication score = 1.5, loss score = 1.0) (Chen et al., 2000).

480

deviations (MAD) (Tria et al., 2017) were also considered as candidates. The final rooting

481

position was reported based on overlaps among those rooting positions (Figs. S9C,E;

482

Table S4).

483
484

Reconciliation-assisted divergence time estimation. To prepare dated gene trees, we

485

first matched species tree nodes with corresponding gene tree nodes using the

486

reconciliation mode of NOTUNG 2.9 (Chen et al., 2000) and created time constraints of

487

speciation nodes (Fig. S9F). Duplication nodes were constrained with the upper and lower

488

age limits derived from corresponding speciation nodes. If the root node is a duplication

489

node and is not covered by the range of the species tree, the upper age limit was set to

490

1,105 million years ago, which corresponds to the split of animals and fungi (Hedges et

491

al., 2006). Divergence time was then estimated by a penalized likelihood method

492

(Sanderson, 2002) implemented in an R package ‘ape’ (‘chronos’ function with ‘discrete’

493

model) (Popescu et al., 2012) with time constraints on speciation, duplication, and root

494

nodes. When reasonable initial parameters were not found after 1,000 trials, the above

495

constraints were partly relaxed (Fig. S9D; Table S4). The implementation is provided on

496

GitHub (https://github.com/kfuku52/RADTE).

497
498

Modeling and shift detection of expression evolution. Using the dated gene trees and

499

organ-wise mean values of SVA-log-TMM-FPKM and SVA-log-TPM, regime shifts in

500

gene expression were detected as shifts of optimal trait values in Ornstein–Uhlenbeck

501

(OU) models determined by a Lasso-based model selection with AICc in an R package

502

‘l1ou’ (Khabbazian et al., 2016). Because there is no available software to handle within-

503

species variation in phylogenetic OU shift detection, we used mean expression level as

504

the input. In the model, α and σ2 parameters were assumed unchanged in the tree

505

(Khabbazian et al., 2016), and therefore only the global, rather than branch- or clade-wise,

506

stationary variance (γ) were obtained. Expression levels in the six organs were treated as

507

multivariate traits where α and σ2 were estimated for each organ but regime shifts were

508

assumed to occur jointly in the same set of branches (Khabbazian et al., 2016). The

509

phylogenetic mean (expression level at the root node) was estimated with the

510

“OUfixedRoot” model. To handle gene trees recalcitrant to this analysis (especially those

511

with a large number of genes), we skimmed gene trees by collapsing clades with small

512

changes in expression level (Fig. S10). Specifically, we first calculated all-vs-all

513

Pearson’s correlation coefficients of gene expression level among all genes that belong

514

the clade. The clade was collapsed into a single tip if the expression patterns were almost

515

identical (minimum correlation coefficient between genes > 0.99). Phylogenetic means

516

of the collapsed clade were calculated by assuming the Brownian motion and were used

517

as expression level at the new tip. The upper limit of regime shifts was set as

518

max ,min(𝑁/2, 100), √𝑁 5, except for the largest tree with 2,382 genes where the upper

519

limit was decreased to 10 to cope with an unrealistically large number of branch

520

combinations to consider. The number of detected regime shifts was always smaller than

521

the upper limit in the SVA-log-TMM-FPKM analysis, whereas three out of 15,820 trees

522

reached the upper limit in the SVA-log-TPM analysis (Fig. S5A).

524

Analysis of expression patterns. We characterized expression patterns of extant and

525

ancestral genes by calculating different metrics from fitted values (μ) in the OU models.

526

Organ specificity was measured by τ (Yanai et al., 2005), which outperformed other

527

methods in a benchmark for tissue specificity (Kryuchkova-Mostacci and Robinson-

528

Rechavi, 2016). Expression complementarity between sister lineages was measured by

529

the metrics called ‘TEC’ (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2011). Because μ was estimated from log-

530

transformed expression levels, these expression metrics were calculated with unlog-

531

transformed μ values. PEOs were defined as the organ in which the highest expression

532

levels were observed among the six organs we analyzed.

543

values were calculated as the θ value at the root node. Using all those parameters, branch-

544

wise nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios were estimated by stochastic

545

substitution mapping (mapdNdS) (Guéguen and Duret, 2018) using bio++ library

546

(Guéguen et al., 2013). To examine the robustness of the mapdNdS-based ω estimation,

547

we compared the results with those obtained by maximum-likelihood ω estimation by

548

fitting MG94W9 models in HyPhy 2.3.11 (Pond et al., 2005). The two methods yielded

549

consistent results on the effect of branching events and expression shifts (Fig. 4A; Fig.

550

S7A), suggesting methodological robustness. We reported mapdNdS-based results in the

551

main text.

552
553

Analysis of gene structure and location. The number of introns and chromosomal

554

location were obtained for each gene from the Ensembl gene models (GFF3 files). The

555

intron numbers were subsequently converted to binary values that represent intronless

556

and intron-containing states. Chromosomal locations were categorized into autosome, X

557

chromosome, and Y chromosome. Genes from non-therian species were treated as

558

missing data because mechanisms of their sex determination are not homologous to the

559

mammalian XY system (Veyrunes et al., 2008). Genes from Chinchilla lanigera were

560

also treated as missing data because their sequenced genomes are not anchored to

561

chromosomes in the Ensembl release 91. The posterior probabilities of ancestral character

562

states were inferred by the stochastic character mapping of discrete traits (Bollback, 2006)

563

implemented in an R package ‘phytools’ (Revell, 2012). Because functional

564

retrotranspositions (Jun et al., 2009; Marques et al., 2005) and inter-chromosomal

565

duplications (Pace et al., 2009) are rare events relative to the timescale of the vertebrate

566

evolution on the per-gene basis, we set the transition rate parameters to a sufficiently

567

small value (1 × 10-3 per gene per million years). Since intron gain occurs few orders of

568

magnitude less frequently than its loss caused by retrotransposition and others (Roy and

569

Gilbert, 2005), the rate of intron gain is set to be lower (1 × 10-4 per gene per million

570

years).

571
572

Analysis of branching events. Speciation and duplication nodes (S and D/R nodes,

573

respectively) were classified by a species-overlap method (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2007) and

574

than 0.5 was classified as a retrotransposition event (R node). The branches that

577

correspond to the original copy of a retrotransposition event were not included in R

578

branches. Although our classification cannot detect retrotranspositions from originally

579

intronless genes, we expect such situations would be rare because most vertebrate genes

580

contain at least one intron (e.g., 20,160/21,242 human genes). Inter-chromosomal

581

translocation was detected by considering chromosomal locations with the highest

582

posterior probability as the ancestral states. Because of the difficulty in determining

583

rooting positions of deep phylogenies, gene tree nodes older than the root node of the

584

species tree were removed from the analysis.

The heatmaps show Pearson’s correlation coefficients among RNA-seq samples (B).

854

Each row and column correspond to one RNA-seq sample. The expression levels of all

855

genes were used to calculate the correlation coefficients. Note that anomalous samples

859

the correlation coefficients depending on whether a pair of samples are the same organ or

860

whether they are from the same research project (C). The numbers of comparisons are

861

provided in the plot. The correlation coefficients are largely improved in within-organ

862

comparisons when surrogate variables are removed, while within-project biases are

863

attenuated. In this species, nine surrogate variables were detected against 52 RNA-seq

864

data from eight projects (D). Analysis of those variables by linear regression highlights

865

the BioProject feature as the strongest source of removed biases. For full description of

866

phylogenetic simulation is shown. Colors show branches belonging to different regimes.

880

Regime shifts (change of color) appear as a substantial change in optimal trait values. (B)

881

Nodes and branches of gene family phylogeny were categorized into S, D, or R based on

882

the branching events, i.e., speciation, DNA-based duplication, or retrotransposition,

883

respectively. (C) Venn diagrams of expression regime shifts. Circles represent the sets of

886

shown as an example. This orthogroup shows ortholog-specific expression patterns as

887

well as regime shifts after speciation and lineage-specific gene duplication. Tips

888

correspond to genes. The colors of branches and tip labels indicate expression regimes.

889

Node colors match to the categorization in B. The heatmap shows expression levels and

among-organ expression patterns are shown as a pie chart for each regime. To the right,

891

the number of introns and located chromosomes (A, autosome; X, X chromosome; Y, Y

Figure 4. Context-dependent changes of protein evolution rate coupled with

908

expression regime shifts. (A) Distribution of ω values. A plus (+) indicates branches

909

with expression shifts, whereas minus (−) branches are sisters to the ‘plus’ branches.

910

Statistical differences between pairs of distributions were tested using a two-sided

911

Brunner–Munzel test . Non-log-transformed median values are shown above the boxplots.

912

For visualization purpose, extreme values exceeding ± 10 were clipped. (B)

913

Relationships between protein evolution rate and change in expression properties. Points

914

correspond to expression regime shifts. Dashed lines indicate no between-branch

915

difference in ω. Solid lines show a linear regression. Its slope and number of regime shifts

916

are provided in the plot. Regime shifts with negative and positive changes were separately

917

analyzed for organ expression specificity (upper) and maximum expression level

918

(middle).

shift detection. (A) The numbers of expression regime shifts. Each point corresponds to

1030

a gene tree. The solid red lines show the upper limits in the regime shift search. The

1031

numbers of shifts detected with SVA-log-TMM-FPKM (left) and SVA-log-TMM

1032

(center) are well correlated (right). The black line is a quantile regression, and the dashed

1033

red line shows a slope of 1. (B) Expression properties. Each point corresponds to an

1034

expression regime shift which is consistently detected by SVA-log-TMM-FPKM and

1035

SVA-log-TPM. (C–D) The branch-wise numbers of detected shifts in the species tree.

1036

The shifts were categorized by primary-expressed organs (PEOs) in ancestral and derived

1037

states. The order of the species tree branches (y axis) corresponds to the total number of

1038

corresponding gene tree branches in the dataset. See Fig. 3A for branch ids.

Fig. S6. The relationships between expression shifts and chromosomal location. The

1053

heatmap shows the frequency of expression shifts observed among the branches with or

without a change in the chromosomal category (non-diagonal or diagonal, respectively).

1055

Chromosomal locations were categorized into autosomes (A), X chromosome (X) and Y

1056

chromosome (Y), and the ancestral locations were inferred by stochastic character

1057

mapping.

Fig. S7. Alternative analysis supporting non-linear change in protein evolution rate

in correlation with expression regime shifts. (A) Distribution of ω values. While the

1062

results from stochastic character mapping (mapdNdS) are reported in the main text, results

1063

from maximum-likelihood estimation (HyPhy) are shown here. A plus (+) indicates

1064

branches with expression shifts, whereas minus (−) branches are sisters to the ‘plus’

1065

branches. Statistical differences between pairs of distributions were tested using a two-

1066

sided Brunner–Munzel test (Brunner and Munzel, 2000). Non-log-transformed median

1067

values are shown above the boxplots. For visualization purpose, extreme values

1068

in expression properties. While SVA-log-TMM-FPKM-based analysis is reported in the

1070

main text, results from SVA-lot-TPM-based analysis is shown here. Stochastic character

1071

mapping was used to obtain branch-wise ω values. Points correspond to expression

1072

regime shifts (log ω ratio = 0). Dashed lines indicate no between-branch difference in

1073

protein evolution rate. Solid lines show a linear regression. Its slope and number of regime

1074

shifts are also provided. Regime shifts with negative and positive changes were separately

1075

analyzed for organ specificity (upper) and expression level (middle).

Fig. S8. Evolutionary dynamics of gene expression analyzed with conservative

1078

datasets. Both SVA-log-TPM and SVA-log-TMM FPKM values were analyzed. Organ-

1079

specific genes were examined by selecting PEO shifts with high ancestral and derived

1080

organ expression specificity (τ > 0.5). To examine the effect of inference errors in gene

1081

tree reconstruction, branches with high support values (ultrafast bootstrap percentage >

1082

99) were analyzed. A and B correspond to Fig. 5B and C, respectively.

Reconciliation-assisted gene tree rooting. Rooting points were estimated with two

1097

different methods: the minimum ancestor deviation (MAD) method and midpoint rooting.

1098

If they were compatible with the event parsimony involving gene duplication and loss,

1099

the MAD- or midpoint-rooted tree was reported in sequence. If not, one of event

1100

parsimony trees was reported. (F) Reconciliation-assisted gene tree dating. Speciation

1101

nodes in the dated species tree were mapped onto the non-dated gene tree by phylogeny

1102

reconciliation. By using those nodes as calibration points, the other node ages were

1103

estimated using the penalized likelihood method.
