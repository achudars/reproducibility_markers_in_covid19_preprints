Abstract
In mathematical epidemiology, a well-known formula describes the impact of
heterogeneity on the basic reproductive number, R0 , for situations in which
transmission is separable and for which there is one source of variation in susceptibility and one source of variation in infectiousness. This formula is written
in terms of the magnitudes of the heterogeneities, as quantified by their coefficients of variation, and the correlation between them. A natural question to ask
is whether analogous results apply when there are multiple sources of variation
in susceptibility and/or infectiousness. In this paper we demonstrate that with
three or more coupled heterogeneities, R0 under separable transmission depends
on details of the distribution of the heterogeneities in a way that is not seen in
the well-known simpler situation. We provide explicit formulae for the cases of
multivariate normal and multivariate log-normal distributions, showing that R0
can again be expressed in terms of the magnitudes of the heterogeneities and
the pairwise correlations between them. The formulae, however, differ between
the two multivariate distributions, demonstrating that no formula of this type
applies generally when there are three or more coupled heterogeneities. We see

that the results of the formulae are approximately equal when heterogeneities
are relatively small and show that an earlier result in the literature (Koella,
1991) should be viewed in this light. We provide numerical illustrations of our
results and discuss a setting in which coupled heterogeneities are likely to have
a major impact on the value of R0 . We also describe a rather surprising result:
in a system with three heterogeneities, R0 can exhibit non-monotonic behavior
with increasing levels of heterogeneity, in marked contrast to the familiar two
heterogeneity setting in which R0 either increases or decreases with increasing
heterogeneity.

1. Introduction

2

The basic reproductive number, R0 , plays a crucial role in determining both

3

whether a pathogen is able to spread and the strength of control measures needed

4

to halt its spread. The simplest descriptions of R0 assume simple transmission

5

scenarios, such as perfect mixing of a population and homogeneity of the individ-

6

uals in the population, e.g. in terms of their susceptibility and infectiousness.

7

The inadequacies of such descriptions have long been realized and much at-

8

tention has been directed towards understanding the impact of heterogeneities

9

in transmission on the basic reproductive number. Early efforts included ac-

10

counting for differing activity levels amongst the population and various mixing

11

patterns of the population (e.g. proportionate/random mixing, assortative and

12

disassortative mixing). Much of this work was prompted by the heterogeneities

13

known to exist for the spread of sexually transmitted infections, notably gonor-

14

rhea and HIV (Nold (1980); Hethcote and Yorke (1984); Anderson et al. (1986);

15

May and Anderson (1987); Jacquez et al. (1988); Gupta et al. (1989)). In the

16

context of vector-borne diseases, it has long been realized that vectors’ bites

17

are not distributed uniformly across hosts; instead, there is a heterogeneity in

18

hosts’ attractiveness to vectors, with some individuals being disproportionately

19

favored to receive bites (Carnevale et al. (1978); Dye and Hasibeder (1986);

20

Woolhouse et al. (1997); De Benedicitis et al. (2003); Liebman et al. (2014);

22

Cooper et al. (2019)).
The simplest theoretical framework for exploring the impact of heterogeneities

23

is the multi-type model (Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000); Diekmann et al.

24

(2012)), in which a population is taken to consist of n types (i.e. epidemiolog-

25

ically relevant categories or groups) of individuals. A now standard argument

26

shows that the basic reproductive number for a multi-type transmission system

27

can be calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix

28

(Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000); Diekmann et al. (2012)). The entries kij

29

of this n by n non-negative matrix give the average number of secondary infec-

30

tions of type i caused by a type j individual in an otherwise entirely susceptible

31

population.

32

Much attention has been directed towards those special cases of hetero-

33

geneous transmission that lead to next generation matrices whose dominant

34

eigenvalue is analytically tractable and hence for which the basic reproductive

35

number can be calculated explicitly. In the context of spatial heterogeneity,

36

these include symmetric spatial configurations such as equally-sized patches

37

with all-to-all or nearest neighbor contacts (see, for example Lloyd and May

38

(1996)).

39

More generally, a commonly-studied situation involves separable transmis-

40

sion (Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000); Diekmann et al. (2012)), where the

41

entries of the next generation matrix have the form kij = p(i)a(i)b(j) Here, the

42

a(i) reflect the susceptibility of type i individuals, the b(j) the infectivity of type

43

44

j individuals and the p(i) give the probabilities that a randomly chosen individP
ual in the population will be of type i. The quantities p(i)a(i)/ k (p(k)a(k))

45

give the probabilities that an infection caused by a type j individual is of type

46

i. By definition for separable transmission, these quantities do not depend on

47

j. In this case, the next generation matrix is of rank one and has dominant

48

eigenvalue

tion leaves them as a component of the a(i). One reason for us doing this is

51

that it emphasizes that R0 does not increase simply as a consequence of there

52

being more groups: increasing the number of groups typically reduces the p(i)

53

accordingly.)

54

This expression for R0 is seen to be an average or expectation taken over

55

the different groups, accounting for the probabilities p(i), and can be written as
R0 = āb̄ + Cov(a, b).

(2)

56

Here, ā and b̄ denote the average values of a(i) and b(i), and Cov(a, b) their

57

covariance. Using the result
E(XY ) = E(X)E(Y ) + Cov(X, Y )

(3)

58

for the expectation of a product of random variables, eqn (1) can be rearranged

59

into the following well-known formula (Dietz, 1980; Dye and Hasibeder, 1986)

60

that sheds insight into the impact of heterogeneity on R0 in this separable

61

setting:
R0

= āb̄ (1 + rab CVa CVb )
= R0hom (1 + rab CVa CVb ) .

(4)

62

Here, rab denotes the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between

63

the a(i) and b(i),
Cov(a, b)
rab = p
,
Var(a)Var(b)

(5)

64

(i.e. the ratio of their covariance to the product of their standard deviations).

65

CVa and CVb denote the coefficients of variation (i.e. standard deviation di-

66

vided by the mean) of a(i) and b(i) and R0hom denotes the value of R0 that

67

would be predicted if the heterogeneity was ignored, i.e. the average values of

68

a(i) and b(i) were used. We emphasize that these results are exact, holding for

69

arbitrary distributions of the a(i), b(i) and p(i).

70

Heterogeneity can either inflate or deflate the value of R0 , depending on

71

whether there is positive or negative correlation between susceptibility and in-

72

fectivity across the groups (Dietz, 1980). In the special case where susceptibility

73

and infectivity are proportional, e.g. for a situation such as differing activity

74

levels or mosquito biting preferences where the heterogeneity impacts both sus-

75

ceptibility and infectiousness in the same way, the formula reduces to

76

This formula has appeared in the literature numerous times in a number of

77

different settings and guises (Dietz, 1980; Dye and Hasibeder, 1986; May and

78

Anderson, 1987).

79

Although discussion of the impact of heterogeneity on R0 is most commonly

80

framed in terms of the multi-type model, similar theory and results can be

81

developed for continuously-distributed heterogeneities (Diekmann et al., 1990;

82

Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000; Diekmann et al., 2012). The normal distri-

83

bution is often used as a first model to describe biological variation and so is a

84

natural description for epidemiological heterogeneity (Sartwell, 1950). However,

85

when variation is moderate or large, i.e. when the coefficient of variation is not

86

small compared to one, a normal distribution will have substantial weight at

87

negative values. For non-negative quantities, a log-normal distribution can be

88

a more natural choice (Sartwell, 1950; Lessler et al., 2009) that provides a more

89

satisfactory description when variation is not small. Another commonly-used

90

choice is the negative binomial distribution (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005), with its

91

overdispersion parameter, k, allowing it to describe a wide variety of levels of

92

variation from the Poisson through to highly overdispersed. Other descriptions

93

used in models include gamma (Cooper et al., 2019) and power-law distribu-

94

tions. As is usual in mathematical modeling, distributional choices reflect a

95

balance between biological plausibility and mathematical tractability. For the

96

purposes of this study, the continuous formulation is attractive from a mathe5

97

matical viewpoint because of analytic results that are available for distributions

98

such as the normal and lognormal.

99

Particularly with the increasing realization that many systems are subject

100

to multiple, often coupled, heterogeneities (Paull et al., 2012; Vazquez-Prokopec

101

et al., 2016), an important question is whether results such as eqns. (4) and

102

(6) generalize to situations in which there are more than two heterogeneities.

103

In this paper, we show that the answer to this question is no: the effect of

104

multiple interacting heterogeneities on the basic reproductive number depends

105

on the details of the distributions of the heterogeneities, in contrast to what oc-

106

curs in the two-heterogeneity setting. We provide results for both multivariate

107

normal (MVN) and multivariate log-normal (MVLN) distributions of hetero-

108

geneities and demonstrate that the two settings can give markedly different

109

results. Furthermore, we show that R0 can have a non-monotonic relationship

110

with the magnitude of a heterogeneity in a way that does not happen in the

111

two-heterogeneity setting.

112

2. The Model

113

2.1. Discrete Heterogeneities: Multi-type Model

114

We assume that there are n types of individuals, resulting from N differ-

115

ent heterogeneities, N1 of which impact susceptibility and N2 of which impact

116

infectiousness. We write the components of susceptibility as ax and those of

117

infectivity as by . An individual’s type can be specified either by their vector of

118

traits, (a1 , · · · , aN1 , b1 , · · · , bN2 ), in a N = N1 + N2 -dimensional trait space, or,

119

because we are in an n-type group setting, by the index i that specifies their

120

group (and hence locates their position within trait space).

121

We further assume that transmission is separable and that the various het-

122

erogeneities impact the susceptibility and infectivity of an individual in a multi-

123

plicative fashion. Thus, we assume that the susceptibility of a type i individual

124

can be written as the product a1 (i)a2 (i) · · · aN1 (i), taken over the heterogeneities

125

that impact susceptibility, that the infectivity of a type j individual can sim-

126

ilarly be written as b1 (j) · · · bN2 (j), and that the probability that a randomly

127

chosen individual from the population is of type i is p(i).

128

The entries of the next generation matrix will have the form
p(i)a1 (i)a2 (i) . . . aN1 (i)b1 (j) · · · bN2 (j).

129

This matrix is of rank one and has dominant eigenvalue given by
R0 =

n
X

p(i)a1 (i) · · · aN1 (i)b1 (i) · · · bN2 (i).

(7)

i=1
130

This formula for R0 can be again be viewed as an expected value, this time of

131

the N -way product of the various ax and by . Noting that we do not need to

132

distinguish whether a given heterogeneity arises from susceptibility or infectivity

133

when we calculate R0 , we choose to drop the notational distinction between

134

the ax and the by , instead referring to a common set xz , where z runs from

135

1 to N = N1 + N2 . This allows us to write common formulae that cover

136

cases where there are a given total number, N , of heterogeneities, rather than

137

separate formulae for different combinations of numbers of susceptibilities and

138

infectivities that sum to N .

139

2.2. Continuous Heterogeneities

140

As described above, an analogous model can be formulated for continuously-

141

distributed heterogeneities. A general model for continuous trait space settings

142

is described in (Diekmann et al., 1990; Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000; Diek-

143

mann et al., 2012). The central component of the model is the kernel function,

144

k(ξ, η), that gives the average number (per unit volume of trait space) of infec-

145

tions with trait ξ that are caused by one individual of trait η over their entire

146

period of infectiousness. A map from one generation to the next is given in

147

terms of a next generation operator, which involves integrals over trait space

148

weighted by the kernel. For separable transmission, the kernel can be decom-

149

posed as k(ξ, η) = p(ξ)a(ξ)b(η) and the basic reproductive number can be found

150

as the following integral
Z
R0 =

a(η)b(η)p(η) dη,
Ω

151

taken over the trait space, Ω. As observed by Diekmann et al., while there

152

are some technicalities, in essence—and for our purposes here—moving from

153

the multi-type model to the continuous trait space model involves replacing the

154

discrete sums described in the previous section by integrals.

155

An individual is specified by their vector of traits (a1 , · · · , aN1 , b1 , · · · , bN2 ) in

156

the N = N1 + N2 -dimensional trait space. In an analogous way to the discrete

157

model, we assume that transmission is separable and that heterogeneities impact

158

susceptibility and infectivity in a multiplicative fashion. This means that the

159

kernel k can be written as k(ξ, η) = p(ξ)a1 (ξ) · · · aN1 (ξ)b1 (η) · · · bN2 (η) and that

160

R0 is given by the integral
Z
R0 =
p(η)a1 (η) · · · aN1 (η)b1 (η) · · · bN2 (η) dη.

(9)

Ω
161

Again, the basic reproductive number can be viewed as the expected value of

162

the product a1 · · · aN1 b1 · · · bN2 . As before we can drop the distinction between

163

the ax and by when performing this calculation: the formula for R0 reduces to

164

computing the expectation of an N -way product of random variables.

165

3. Analysis

166

The well-known result (eqn 4), as explained above, arises from seeing the

167

formula for the basic reproductive number under separable transmission (eqn 1)

168

as an expectation of the product of a pair of random variables and the ability

169

to express this in terms of the pair’s two expectations and covariance (eqn 3),

170

and hence ultimately in terms of coefficients of variation and the correlation

171

coefficient (eqn 4).

172

Answering our main question—whether the result can be extended to the

173

case of three or more heterogeneities—requires corresponding manipulations

174

of expectations of products of three or more random variables—the so-called

175

product moments of the joint distribution. We remind ourselves that a crucial

176

part of the standard analysis in the two heterogeneity case was the generality of

177

the formula for the expected value of a product of a pair of random variables,

178

which held for arbitrary distributions.

179

3.1. Product Moments of Random Variables; Main Analytic Results

180

Closed-form formulae for product moments of multivariate distributions are

181

not generally available. As a result, our analytic results are limited to certain

182

distributions for which such formulae are available. These include the multivari-

183

ate normal (MVN) and multivariate log-normal (MVLN) distributions, both of

184

which are continuous distributions. To our knowledge, formulae for product

185

moments are not available for widely-used discrete multivariate distributions.

186

Hence, our analytic results focus on continuously-distributed heterogeneities.

187

In the case of a set of random variables whose joint distribution is multi-

188

variate normal, numerous authors have obtained results for product moments

189

(see, for example, Isserlis (1918), Bendat and Piersol (1966), Bär and Dittrich

190

(1971) and Song and Lee (2015)). The general formula for an N -dimensional

191

multivariate normal distribution is, however, unwieldy, so we do not present it

192

here. In the four dimensional case, with (X1 , X2 , X3 , X4 ) distributed accord-

193

ing to a 4-dimensional multivariate normal distribution, we have (Bendat and

194

Piersol (1966) and Bär and Dittrich (1971))
E(X1 X2 X3 X4 ) = E(X1 X2 )E(X3 X4 ) + E(X1 X3 )E(X2 X4 )+
E(X1 X4 )E(X2 X3 ) − 2E(X1 )E(X2 )E(X3 )E(X4 ).

195

Each expectation of a pairwise product in this equation can be rewritten in the

196

way described above (first using eqn (3) to write in terms of the product of a

197

pair of expectations and their covariance, and then using eqn (5) to rewrite the

198

covariance in terms of coefficients of variation and correlation coefficients) to

199

give
E(X1 X2 X3 X4 ) = E(X1 )E(X2 )E(X3 )E(X4 )×

(1 + rX1 ,X2 CVX1 CVX2 ) (1 + rX3 ,X4 CVX3 CVX4 ) +
(1 + rX1 ,X3 CVX1 CVX3 ) (1 + rX2 ,X4 CVX2 CVX4 ) +
(1 + rX1 ,X4 CVX1 CVX4 ) (1 + rX2 ,X3 CVX2 CVX3 ) −
2 .

The case of three random variables can be obtained by setting X4 = 1. In this

201

case, CVX4 is equal to zero, and so the three parenthetic terms (1 + rXi ,X4 CVXi CVX4 )

202

each equal one, leaving
E(X1 X2 X3 ) = E(X1 )E(X2 )E(X3 ){1 + rX1 ,X2 CVX1 CVX2 +
rX1 ,X3 CVX1 CVX3 + rX2 ,X3 CVX2 CVX3 }.

203

204

(11)

For a set of N multivariate lognormally distributed random variables, product moments are given by the formula (Kotz et al., 2000)

205

where ξ and V are the mean and variance of the corresponding multivariate

206

normal distribution. In the four dimensional case, some simple manipulation

207

leads to
E(X1 X2 X3 X4 ) = E(X1 )E(X2 )E(X3 )E(X4 )×
(1 + rX1 ,X2 CVX1 CVX2 ) (1 + rX1 ,X3 CVX1 CVX3 ) ×
(1 + rX1 ,X4 CVX1 CVX4 ) (1 + rX2 ,X3 CVX2 CVX3 ) ×
(1 + rX2 ,X4 CVX2 CVX4 ) (1 + rX3 ,X4 CVX3 CVX4 ) . (12)

208

For the case of three random variables, setting X4 = 1 gives
E(X1 X2 X3 ) = E(X1 )E(X2 )E(X3 ) (1 + rX1 ,X2 CVX1 CVX2 ) ×
(1 + rX1 ,X3 CVX1 CVX3 ) (1 + rX2 ,X3 CVX2 CVX3 ) . (13)

209

We see that different expressions are obtained for the expectation of a prod-

210

uct of four random variables between the multivariate normal (eqn 10) and

211

multivariate lognormal (eqn 12) distributions—for instance, terms in the former

212

involve products of at most two correlation coefficients, whereas the latter in-

213

cludes a term in which all six correlation coefficients are multiplied. Differences

214

are similarly seen for the expectation of a product of three random variables for

215

these two distributions (eqns (11) and (13)).

216

The observation that eqns (10) and (12) differ, and that their reduced forms

217

when X4 = 1 also differ, shows that that there is no general formula of this

heterogeneities. This answers the main question posed in this paper. We do

notice, however, that the two formulae give approximately equal results in the

limit of small coefficients of variation, i.e. when one can ignore terms involving

222

products of more than two pairs of coefficients of variation (these are terms that

involve products of two or more correlation coefficients). In this case, both eqns

For the case of three random variables, we see that the small coefficient of

226

variation approximation of the three-way MLVN formula (eqn 13) is precisely

227

the formula obtained from the MVN (eqn 11).

3.2. Comparison to Previous Results

229

The majority of papers in the literature that provide analytic results for

230

the basic reproductive number under heterogeneity focus on at most two cou-

231

pled heterogeneities. One notable exception is the work of Koella (1991), which

232

considers a vector-borne pathogen subject to heterogeneities in mosquito bit-

233

ing rate, a, human susceptibility, b2 , and duration of human infection, ρ. In

234

a homogeneous setting, the basic reproductive number (strictly speaking, the

235

type reproductive number (Heesterbeek and Roberts, 2007) that considers the

236

complete two-step transmission cycle of the infection) is given by
R0hom =

ma2 b1 b2 e−µT ρ
.
µ

(15)

237

Here, m is the ratio of adult female mosquitoes to humans, b1 is the per-bite

238

transmission probability from human to mosquito, b2 is the per-bite transmission

239

probability from mosquito to human, µ is the mosquito death rate (so that 1/µ

240

is the average lifespan of an adult female mosquito) and T is the duration of

241

the extrinsic incubation period (i.e. the latent period for the infection within

242

the mosquito). Note that the biting rate a appears as a squared term, reflecting

243

that the transmission cycle involves two bites by the vector.

244

Koella provides—without proof or qualification for its applicability—the fol-

245

lowing formula for the basic reproductive number when a, b2 and ρ exhibit

heterogeneity:

247

Note that the single biological heterogeneity in biting rate impacts both infec-

248

tiousness and susceptibility, resulting in it being treated as two perfectly corre-

249

lated heterogeneities. (The version of eqn (16) given in Koella (1991) appears

250

to have minor but important typographical errors, which are corrected here. In

251

each of the denominators of Koella’s eqn 3, an overbar appears over the entire

252

denominator, whereas overbars should appear separately over individual terms.)

253

In our notation, we write X1 = X2 = a, X3 = b2 and X4 = (mb1 e−µT /µ)ρ.

254

Here X1 and X3 impact susceptibility, while X2 and X4 impact infectiousness.

255

(We choose to write all of the constant factors within X4 purely for notational

256

convenience.) We note that eqn (16) has no terms that involve products of

257

pairs of covariances (or, in the language of the earlier formulae, correlation co-

258

efficients). Rewriting Koella’s formula in our notation, we see that it follows

259

the approximate formula eqn (14) and so should be seen as an approximation

260

that is likely most accurate when coefficients of variation are small (i.e. the

261

heterogeneities are relatively minor). We remark that the Koella formula does

262

agree with the exact result for the multivariate normal distribution, eqn (10),

263

if the coefficient of variation describing either human susceptibility or the du-

264

ration of human infection is equal to zero (i.e. in the case of three coupled

265

heterogeneities).

4. Results

267

4.1. Results from Analytic Formulae

268

We present numerical results obtained from the analytic formulae, allowing

269

us to explore the differences between predictions made using the formulae for the

270

two distributions and also using the formula in the small coefficient of variation

271

limit. For concreteness, we place these simulations within the vector-host setting

272

described above, based on Koella (1991), but for simplicity we hold one of

273

the factors constant. Specifically, mosquitoes differ in their biting rate, which

274

impacts both infectivity and susceptibility and thus is treated as two perfectly

275

correlated heterogeneities, X1 and X2 , and hosts differ in their duration of

276

infectiousness, X3 . Setting X4 = 1 and taking X2 = X1 , we obtain the following

277

two formulae:

R0 = E(X1 )2 E(X3 ) 1 + CV2X1 + 2rX1 ,X3 CVX1 CVX3

278

(17)

for multivariate normally (MVN) distributed heterogeneities, and


R0 = E(X1 )2 E(X3 ) 1 + CV2X1 1 + rX1 ,X3 CVX1 CVX3

2

(18)

279

for multivariate lognormally (MVLN) distributed heterogeneities. As discussed

280

above, in this reduced setting of X4 = 1, the MVN formula is the same as the

281

the small coefficient of variation limit of the MVLN formula and agrees with

282

the Koella formula. Furthermore, we see that when the correlation coefficient,

283

rX1 ,X3 , between the two heterogeneities is zero, the two formulae are identical.

284

Figure (1) compares the R0 values for heterogeneities distributed according

285

to MVN (solid line, from eqn 17) and MVLN (dashed line, from eqn 18) dis-

286

tributions, across varying levels of correlation between the heterogeneities. We

287

see that the two distributions do indeed lead to identical R0 values when the

288

correlation coefficient is zero. For positive values of the correlation coefficient,

289

the MVLN distribution leads to a larger value of R0 than the MVN, while the

290

opposite is true for negative values of the correlation coefficient.

291

Figure (2) depicts how R0 values for heterogeneities distributed according to

292

MVN (solid lines) and MVLN (dashed lines) distributions differ across varying

number is the same for both distributions when the correlation coefficient is equal to zero,
and that this is greater than the value R0hom obtained using the average values because of
heterogeneity in the biting rate.

293

levels of correlation between the heterogeneities, for three different levels of

294

heterogeneity in the human duration of infection, X3 . Heterogeneity in X3 is

295

smallest for the blue lines (Var(X3 ) = 1), greatest for the red lines (Var(X3 ) =

296

10), with an intermediate level for the black lines (Var(X3 ) = 4: note that

297

these black lines are identical to those in Figure 1). We see that larger levels

298

of heterogeneity lead both to larger deviations in R0 (increases or decreases,

299

respectively, for positive or negative values of the correlation coefficient rX1 ,X3 )

300

from the value seen when the two heterogeneities are uncorrelated, and larger

301

differences between the values of R0 that result from use of the two different

302

distributions.

303

Figure (3) depicts how R0 values for heterogeneities distributed according to

304

MVN (solid lines) and MVLN (dashed lines) distributions differ across varying

305

levels of the heterogeneity in biting rate, X1 , for two different levels of corre-

306

lation between the heterogeneities. Figure (3a) depicts results under a positive

307

correlation, rX1 ,X3 = 0.5, while Figure (3b) shows results for a negative cor-

308

relation, rX1 ,X3 = −0.4. For positive values of the correlation, we see that

309

increasing levels of heterogeneity in biting rate lead to larger values of R0 , with

310

larger values seen under the MVLN than the MVN, in agreement with obser-

311

vations made in earlier figures. Both distributions give the same value of R0

312

when there is no variation in biting rate; this equals R0hom obtained using the

313

average values. Note that R0 varies nonlinearly with the level of variation in

314

biting rate, reflecting the biting rate’s quadratic influence on R0 .

315

Figure (3b) provides a very surprising result: when the correlation coeffi-

316

cient is negative, the basic reproductive number can exhibit non-monotonicity

317

as the level of heterogeneity increases. This result, which does not occur in the

318

two heterogeneity setting, arises from R0 increasing in a quadratic manner on

319

the heterogeneous biting rate but decreasing in a linear fashion on the inter-

320

action between heterogeneities in biting rate and duration of infection. Non-

321

monotonicity will always occur as the magnitude of a heterogeneity is varied if

322

that heterogeneity impacts both susceptibility and infectivity and is also nega-

323

tively correlated with another heterogeneity.

blue lines have Var(X3 ) = 1, while red lines have Var(X3 ) = 10. As in Figure (1), X1 and X3
are taken to have means equal to 1 and 5, respectively, and Var(X1 ) = 0.2. The value of the

324

Figure (3c) shows that for the MVLN distribution, non-monotonicity can

325

be more severe than depicted in Figure (3b). For this distribution, R0 depends

326

in a quartic manner on the magnitude, CVX1 , of the heterogeneity X1 , and so

327

there can be multiple local minima. Looking over the larger range of values for

328

CVX1 shown in this panel (except for this, all other details are as in panel b),

329

one sees a local maximum in R0 when CVX1 ≈ 3.0 and a second local minimum

330

when CVX1 = −1/(CVX3 rX1 ,X3 ) = 6.25. This second local minimum, at which

331

R0 is equal to zero, arises when the term in braces that gets squared in eqn (18)

332

equals zero.

333

In the four heterogeneity formulae, setting X1 = X2 gives R0 as a quadratic

334

function of CVX1 in the MVN case and a sixth degree polynomial in the MVLN

335

case.

336

4.2. Multi-Type Model Results

337

We conclude with a numerical example in a multi-type setting, based on real-

338

world data from Cooper et al. (2019) on heterogeneity in mosquito biting rates

339

across groups in a study in Uganda. Cooper et al. fit gamma distributions to

340

the relative numbers of bites received by different groups (for them, households)

341

for a number of locations. The degree of heterogeneity was found to vary across

342

location and time; we use the gamma distribution fitted to relative bite count

343

data from Jinja District, for which the standard deviation was 0.985 and, by

344

definition, the mean was 1. Note that the coefficient of variation here is large

345

compared to values depicted in Figures (3a and b).

346

We employ a thousand group model, with an equal number of individu-

347

als (people) in each. We assume that groups differ in their attractiveness to

348

mosquitoes and in the average duration of human infection. By definition in

349

this multi-group model, all members of a group are taken to have identical at-

350

tributes. We write the relative attractiveness and duration of human infection

351

of group i as zi and ρi , respectively. As in the Cooper et al. study, we take

352

the zi to have mean one, so that the per-mosquito biting rate on group i, ai ,

353

is given by the product of the average biting rate and the relative attractive17

the susceptibility parameter was fixed at 1 for the entire population. The horizontal dashed
lines denote the value of R0 if there was no heterogeneity, i.e. obtained using the average

354

ness: ai = āzi . Finally, we assume some level of correlation, ra,ρ , between the

355

zi (or, equivalently, the ai ) and ρi . Because of the lack of data on multiple

356

coupled heterogeneities, we will explore the impact of different levels and signs

357

of correlation between the two variables.

358

We base our parameter values on those used by Chitnis et al. (2008) in a

359

modeling study of malaria transmission, using their high intensity transmission

360

scenario. We take the average mosquito biting rate, ā, to be 0.5 per day, the

361

ratio of vectors to hosts, m, to be 9.27, the per-bite transmission probabilities

362

b1 and b2 to equal 0.022 and 0.48, respectively, the average mosquito lifespan,

363

1/µ, to be 10 days, and the extrinsic incubation period, T , to be 11 days. We

364

assume the duration of human infection is lognormally distributed, with mean

365

290 days (corresponding to the 9.5 month average duration described by Chitnis

366

et al.) and coefficient of variation 0.4.

367

For each group, we draw the relative biting attractiveness, zi , and duration

368

of human infection, ρi , from a bivariate distribution with gamma and lognormal

369

marginals as described above. These numbers are obtained using the NORTA

370

algorithm (Cario and Nelson, 1997, 1998), as implemented by the NORTARA

371

package (Su, 2014) in R (R Core Team, 2019). This algorithm allows genera-

372

tion of random numbers from multivariate distributions with specified marginal

373

distributions and correlation structure.

374

375

The next generation matrix (considering the complete transmission cycle
from human to human, via mosquito) has entries ki j , where
ki j = mai aj b1 b2 ρj exp(−µT )/µ.

376

We see that this next generation matrix is separable and involves the product

377

of three group-dependent quantities (ai , aj and ρj ).

378

If there was no heterogeneity, the value of the basic reproductive number

379

would equal R0hom = mā2 b1 b2 ρ̄ exp(−µT )/µ, and take the value 23.63 given the

380

parameters employed here. If the only heterogeneity was in mosquito biting

381

preference, the basic reproductive number would be inflated by the factor 1 +

382

Var(zi ) = 1.97, giving an R0 of 46.58. (The attentive reader might notice that

383

our values of R0 appear quite different to those of Chitnis et al. (2008) even

384

in the homogeneous setting. The major difference arises because we calculate

385

values on a per transmission cycle basis rather than the per transmission event

386

basis employed by Chitnis et al. (2008): their R0 formula is essentially the

387

square root of the one used here. Beyond this, there are some minor differences

388

in model formulations, such as our use of a fixed duration of latency.)

389

For a given set of values of ai and ρj , the value of R0 for this model with

390

its coupled heterogeneities can be calculated exactly using eqn (7). We would

391

like to be able to relate this to the moments of the individual heterogeneities,

392

but we do not have a closed form expression for the product moments of the

393

multivariate distribution employed in this example. As we are in a three het-

394

erogeneity setting, we could use the formulae derived using the multivariate

395

normal (eqn 17) or multivariate lognormal (eqn 18) distribution. Both will be

396

approximations because they were derived using distributions different to the

397

one employed in this example. Recall that in this three heterogeneity setting,

398

the MVN formula is identical to the small coefficient of variation limit of the

399

MVLN formula and to the Koella formula. (It should be kept in mind, however,

400

that coefficients of variation are large in this numerical example, meaning that

401

we are not in the weak heterogeneity limit.) Finally, when using the MVN and

402

MVLN formulae, we can either use means and coefficients of variation calculated

403

based on the set of values of ai and ρj , or those of the underlying distribution

404

from which these values were drawn. Because we are using a sampled set of

405

values, moments calculated from the sample will generally differ from those of

406

the underlying distribution.

407

We remark that the relevant product moment of the continuous multivariate

408

gamma/lognormal distribution that underlies this example (i.e. the distribution

409

from which the groups’ attributes are sampled) could be obtained numerically

410

using Monte Carlo numerical integration. Indeed, we see that the value of R0

411

obtained from eqn (7) can be viewed in just this way as an (admittedly crude)

412

Monte Carlo estimate. One approach to obtain a better approximation would

413

be to repeat the group attribute sampling process, evaluating R0 each time, and

Table 1: R0 values for the multi-group host-vector transmission model. As described in the
text, the groups differ in terms of the mosquito biting rate (a) and the duration of human
infection (ρ), with different levels and directions of correlation between the two heterogeneities
(raρ ). The “Numerical (exact)” column gives (exact) numerical results obtained from a 1000
group model, with group attributes sampled from a bivariate distribution with relative biting
attractivenesses of the groups given by a gamma distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.985 (Cooper et al., 2019) and durations of human infection lognormally distributed
with mean 290 days and standard deviation 116 days. Other parameters are given in the text
and lead to a value of R0hom of 23.63. MVN and MVLN formulae refer to results obtained
using analytical formulae (eqns 17 and 18), either using means and coefficients of variation
obtained from the set of attributes in the 1000 group model, or by using the corresponding
quantities from the underlying continuous distribution from which group attributes are sampled. Monte Carlo refers to results obtained using numerically estimated product moments of
the underlying continuous distribution from which group attributes are sampled. Monte Carlo
estimates were obtained by averaging over 4000 sets of results for the 1000 group model. Both
the standard error (quoted as ± value) of this estimate and the standard deviation across the
4000 sets of results (value in parentheses) are given. The standard error, which describes the
uncertainty in the Monte Carlo estimate, is obtained by dividing the standard deviation by
√
4000. The standard deviation describes the dispersion of R0 values obtained from single
realizations of the 1000 group model about the underlying mean.

417

Results are shown in Table (1), and are as anticipated from the discussion

418

of the analytic results. As mentioned above, heterogeneity in biting alone in-

419

flates the value of R0 to 46.58, above the value of R0hom = 23.63 that would

be predicted if each group’s attributes were simply equal to the average of the

421

underlying distribution. Exact results obtained from the 1000 group model (the

422

column labeled “Numerical (Exact)”), show that positive correlation between

423

the biting attractiveness and duration of infectiousness further increases R0 ,

424

with a greater increase when the correlation is stronger. Negative correlation

425

decreases the value of R0 . Note that the exact value obtained when the cor-

426

relation is zero differs from the 46.58 stated above: sampling variation (when

427

drawing the 1000 sets of attributes) means that the averages of the ai and ρj

428

for the 1000 groups differ from those of the underlying distribution.

429

Values obtained from the single realization of the 1000 group model are

430

consistent with the Monte Carlo estimates of the basic reproductive number that

431

would pertain if the heterogeneity exactly followed the underlying continuous

432

multivariate distribution. Some variation from these values is observed: this is

433

a consequence of the attributes in the 1000 group model being a not so large

434

sample drawn from a distribution with marked variation and skewness. We

435

see that the MVLN formula provides a closer approximation to the exact value

436

of the reproductive number than does the MVN formula (which we recall is

437

identical to both the small heterogeneity and Koella’s formula). The MVLN

438

formula does tend to overestimate the impact of the coupled heterogeneity, in

439

each case moving it further away (either in a positive or negative direction,

440

depending on whether ra,ρ is positive or negative) from the value obtained with

441

zero correlation, compared to the Monte Carlo estimate.

442

To emphasize the difference between settings involving three or more hetero-

443

geneities and the more familiar two heterogeneity setting, we remind the reader

444

that equation (4) for R0 is exact in the two heterogeneity case, regardless of the

445

details of the distributions of the heterogeneities. Values in the three “Sample”

446

columns of a corresponding table in the two heterogeneity case would be equal,

447

as would be the values in the two MVN and MVLN “Underlying Distribution”

448

columns.

5. Discussion

450

In this paper we have shown that the well-known result for the impact of two

451

coupled heterogeneities on the basic reproductive number of an epidemiological

452

system under separable transmission does not have a general counterpart when

453

there are three or more coupled heterogeneities. In the more general setting,

454

the formula for the basic reproductive number depends on details of the joint

455

distribution of the heterogeneities in a way that is quite different than in the

456

setting with two heterogeneities. We were able to derive formulae that related

457

the basic reproductive number to the magnitudes of the heterogeneities and

458

their pairwise correlations for the special cases of multivariate normal and mul-

459

tivariate lognormal distributions of heterogeneities. Under particular limiting

460

cases (typically in the limit of low levels of heterogeneity), the two formulae give

461

similar predictions. We showed that an earlier result in the literature (Koella,

462

1991) should be viewed as an approximate result, although we noted that in ap-

463

propriate limiting cases, the result agrees with our formula for the multivariate

464

normal distribution.

465

The R0 formulae obtained here were derived for continuous multivariate

466

distributions and thus can only provide an approximation for discrete multi-

467

group settings such as our numerical example. (Furthermore, our numerical

468

example used an underlying distribution that differed from the ones for which

469

we derived our formulae.) This approximation would improve as the number of

470

groups increased and the multi-group model more closely approximated a setting

471

in which heterogeneities could be treated as being continuously distributed. This

472

again is in contrast to the two heterogeneity setting, in which the well-known

473

result is exact, applyng to all distributions.

474

It is only possible to obtain analytic formulae for the basic reproductive

475

number in multi-type models whose structure permits evaluation of the domi-

476

nant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix. Although separable transmission

477

provides one class of models for which this is the case, and has thus received

478

much attention in the theoretical literature, it should be realized that most

479

real-world transmission settings that involve structure do not fall in this class.

480

Spatial models will almost invariably lead to non-separable transmission: in-

481

teractions are more likely with nearby than distant individuals, so numbers of

482

encounters depend on the relative locations of both individuals, rather than sep-

483

arately on their two locations. Another example is provided by age structure,

484

commonly discussed in the context of childhood infections. Here, individuals

485

are more likely to interact with individuals of a similar age than those of a

486

different age. In models for the spread of sexually transmitted infections, it is

487

often the case that individuals are more likely to interact with ones who are

488

similar to themselves (e.g. highly sexually active people are more likely to have

489

such a partner). Each of these departures results from some form of assortative

490

mixing, a commonly-observed property in real-world social networks Newman

491

(2003). While separable transmission might not be reflective of all real-world

492

settings, that it allows us the ability to gain analytic insights into the impact

493

of heterogeneity means that it remains a useful situation to study, although the

494

limitations of its applicability must be borne in mind.

495

Although theoretical attention has typically focused on the two heterogene-

496

ity case, and this has provided much insight, heterogeneous transmission in the

497

real world typically involves more than two factors (Paull et al., 2012; Vazquez-

498

Prokopec et al., 2016). Vector borne diseases provide striking examples of sys-

499

tems impacted by multiple, coupled heterogeneities (Koella, 1991; Smith et al.,

500

2014; Vazquez-Prokopec et al., 2016; Irvine et al., 2018). Both host and vec-

501

tor populations themselves exhibit epidemiological heterogeneities, such as host

502

movement patterns (Stoddard et al., 2013), duration and severity of host infec-

503

tiousness (Nguyet et al., 2013) and vector density (LaCon et al., 2014), as well

504

as having significant heterogeneity in their interactions, for instance due to host

505

biting preference and spatial co-location between hosts and vectors (Liebman

506

et al., 2014; Cooper et al., 2019). As such, epidemiological systems such as

507

the human/Aedes aegypti /dengue virus or human/Anopheles/malaria systems

508

represent prime examples for the application of results such as those discussed

509

here. Our ability to apply these results at present is, however, hindered by

510

the lack of datasets in which multiple heterogeneities have been simultaneously

511

characterized.

512

When transmission is heterogeneous, control measures that account for the

513

heterogeneity are much more effective than ones that do not (Dye and Hasibeder,

514

1986; Anderson and May, 1991; Woolhouse et al., 1997; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005;

515

Cooper et al., 2019), an observation that has driven much of the research into

516

heterogeneity in transmission. The most striking result of this study is the ob-

517

servation that R0 can have a non-monotonic dependence on the magnitude of a

518

heterogeneity when there are three or more coupled heterogeneities—in marked

519

contrast to the behavior seen in the two heterogeneity case. Indeed, in the case

520

of a multivariate lognormal distribution, there is the potential for multiple local

521

minima and maxima in the basic reproductive to occur as the level of hetero-

522

geneity is changed. Non-monotonicity could have important implications for the

523

impact of targeted controls, which typically lead to a reduction in the degree

524

of heterogeneity across the population. In such cases, non-monotonicity could

525

conceivably and perversely lead to an increase in the reproductive number for

526

some levels of control. We comment that the example in which we demonstrated

527

non-monotonicity involved varying the level of heterogeneity while keeping the

528

mean transmission potential constant, while control would involve decreasing

529

both mean and variation. As such, the potential for this phenomenon to cause

530

perverse outcomes of targeted control is not immediate; we defer exploration of

531

this to a later study.

532

The results of this paper demonstrate the importance of gaining understand-

533

ing of how multiple coupled heterogeneities impact transmission. Even with the

534

addition of just one additional heterogeneity, our analysis reveals that surprising

535

behavior can be observed beyond what has previously been seen in the setting

536

of two heterogeneities. While providing a theoretical step in this direction, this

537

study highlights the limitations of general results that can be obtained in more

538

realistic settings. It aims to guide more detailed studies that involve numerical

539

exploration of specific situations, yielding further insights into the epidemio-

540

logical role of individual variability. We argue for the need to move beyond
