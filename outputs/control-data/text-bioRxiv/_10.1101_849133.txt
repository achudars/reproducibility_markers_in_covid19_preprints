ABSTRACT
Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disease caused by mutations in the FBN1
gene. Nevertheless, other genes influence the manifestations of the disease, characterized by
high clinical variability even within families. We mapped modifier loci for cardiovascular
and skeletal manifestations in the mg‚àÜloxPneo mouse model for MFS and the synthenic loci in
the human genome. Corroborating our findings, one of those loci was identified also as a
modifier locus in MFS patients. Here we investigate the HSPG2 gene, located in this region,
as a candidate modifier gene for MFS. We show a correlation between Fbn1 and Hspg2
expression in spinal column and aorta in non-isogenic mg‚àÜloxPneo mice. Moreover, we show
that mice with severe phenotypes present lower expression of Hspg2 than those mildly
affected. Thus, we propose that HSPG2 is a strong candidate modifier gene for MFS and its
role in modulating disease severity should be investigated in patients.

connective tissue with high clinical variability both between and within families (1). It is
caused by mutations in FBN1 gene encoding fibrilin-1, the major component of microfibrils
(2). Microfibrils are present in several tissues, which makes MFS a pleiotropic disease
affecting mostly the ocular, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems (3).
Previous works had suggested that variations on FBN1 expression caused by polymorphisms
in the gene could play a role as a modifier of disease severity (4,5). However, giving the poor
genotype-phenotype correlations and the large intrafamilial clinical variability of the disease,
recent works have been focusing on understanding how variants in other genes influence MFS
phenotypes (6‚Äì8).
The effect of genetic background on phenotypic variability in MFS was demonstrated in mice
for the first time by our group (9). We showed that mg‚àÜloxPneo mice in the 129/Sv (129)
isogenic background presented earlier age of onset of the disease when compared to those in
the C57BL/6 (B6) background. Subsequently, we identified loci modulating the phenotypic
variability in B6/129 mixed mg‚àÜloxPneo mice. One locus on chromosome 4 is associated with
variability of the cardiovascular phenotype, while another, on chromosome 3 is associated
with skeletal variability (8). Interestingly, these loci are synthenic with two contiguous
regions on human chromosome 1 (8).
One of the candidate genes we identified in this region was Hspg2, which encodes perlecan,
a heparan-sulfate proteoglycan. Mutations in Hspg2 are associated with Schwartz-Jampel
Syndrome (SJS) (SJS1; MIM# 255800), an autosomal recessive disease characterized by
skeletal manifestations. Knockout mice for

Hspg2 present severe kyphoscoliosis and

dwarfism (10). In addition, these mice die around birth due to severe heart arrest, showing
that Hspg2 plays a role in the formation of not only the skeletal but also the cardiac system

(10).
Biochemical studies show that perlecan is also involved in maintenance of vascular
homeostasis by its interaction with several extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including
fibrillin-1 (11,12). This interaction is essential for the positioning of fibrilin-1 multimeres in
the pericellular space and, consequently, the assembly of microfibrils (12‚Äì14).
Given these findings, we propose that Hspg2 is a strong candidate modifier gene for MFS.
Here we used the MFS mouse model mg‚àÜloxPneo on a mixed background (B6/129) to compare
Hspg2 expression between mild and severely affected mice. We show a correlation between
Fbn1 and Hspg2 expression, and an association between lower Hspg2 expression and more
severe vascular and skeletal phenotypes, corroborating our hypothesis of Hspg2 as a modifier
gene of MFS.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

B6/129 mg‚àÜloxPneo mice tissues collection and phenotyping
B6/129 mg‚àÜloxPneo mice were generated as previously described (8).

The project was

approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Institute of
Biosciences, University of S√£o Paulo.
Skeletal phenotype: Full body digital radiographic images of euthanatized animals were
obtained using In-Vivo Imaging System FX PRO (Bruker, Germany) for skeletal
phenotyping. Kyphosis index (KI) was measured as described (15). We selected 10 mice with

the lowest KI values as the severe group and the 10 mice with the highest KI values as the
mild group. Thoracic spinal column fragments were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen
for RNA extraction.
Vascular phenotype: Thoracic aorta and thoracic spinal column fragments were collected
from each mouse. One fragment was frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction, while
another was processed as described (16) for histological analysis. For each animal, three
transversal slices of the aorta were analyzed for elastic fibers fragmentation by optical
microscopy, where number of fragmentations (N) was counted (Supplemental Figure 1).

Elastic fibers integrity index (EFI) was calculated as following: ùê∏ùêπùêº = ùëÄùëíùëéùëõ (ùëÅ+1).
Thoracic aortic transversal sections were also screened for aneurysms. Mice with aneurysms
(n = 7) were considered as a separated group (mg‚àÜloxPneo_A). Mice presenting an EFI higher
than the third quartile of distribution were considered mild (n = 9) and mice presenting an
EFI lower than the first quartile of distribution were considered severe (n = 9).

RNA extraction and gene expression assay
Spinal column and thoracic aorta fragments were macerated in liquid nitrogen in Trizol¬Æ
reagent (ThermoFisher) and the RNA was isolated by RNeasy MiniSpin using RNeasy
MiniKit (Qiagen). Complementar DNA (cDNA) was obtained from 500ng of total RNA using
SuperScript‚Ñ¢ III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermofisher). For both Fbn1 and Hspg2
expression analysis we used TaqMan¬Æ Gene Expression Assay (Thermofisher Mm01334119_m1 and Mm01181173_g1, respectively). The gene Actb (TaqMan¬Æ Gene
Expression Assay - Mm00607939_s1) was used as endogenous control.

Statistical analysis
Wilcoxon non-parametric test was used for statistical analysis on comparative gene
expression. Pearson correlation test was also used for gene expression correlation analysis.
Tests which obtained p-value<0.05 were considered statistically significant and rejected null
hypothesis. All the computation was performed using R software (version 3.6.1).

RESULTS

Hspg2 expression and its association with phenotypes severity
Heterozygous mg‚àÜloxPneo (F2 B6/129) animals were phenotyped for skeletal and
cardiovascular systems and separated in groups according to severity (Supplemental Figure
1). Expression of Fbn1 and Hspg2 was quantified in aorta and spinal column fragments
(Figure 1). No difference of Fbn1 expression in the spinal column was observed between
severe and mild mice for skeletal phenotype (Figure 1A). In contrast, we observed lower
expression of Hspg2 in mice with more severe hyperkyphosis in comparison with the mild
group (p < 0.05) (Figure 1A).
Fbn1 expression in the aorta did not vary among the three groups of mg‚àÜloxPneo mice separated
according to vascular phenotype (mild, severe and with aneurysm) (Figure 1B). However,
expression of Hspg2 was lower in the severely affected group and the group with aneurysm

Correlation between Fbn1 and Hspg2 expression
Although we did not find any differences in Fbn1 expression between groups in the two
phenotypes analyzed, we tested for correlation between Fbn1 and Hspg2 expression which
could suggest co-function of the corresponding proteins in tissue maintenance. We observed
a significant positive correlation between Fbn1 and Hspg2 expression on both spinal column
and aortic fragments (p < 0.01 | r2 = 0.66 and p < 0.01 | r2 = 0.91, respectively) (Figure 2).

DISCUSSION
The development of the mg‚àÜloxPneo mouse model of the intrafamilial clinical variability of
MFS allowed us to identify the Awtq1 locus in mouse chromosome 4/human chromosome 1
as a modifier of the cardiovascular phenotype. Within that locus we highlighted Hspg2 as a
candidate modifier gene based on its involvement in skeletal and cardiovascular function, and
its direct interaction with fibrillin-1 (10,12,17).
More recently, a combination of genome-wide approaches in 1070 MFS patients led to the
identification of a smaller modifier locus for the cardiovascular phenotype named gMod-M1
which overlaps with Awtq1 (7). The authors reported that the only candidate gene within that
locus was ECE1, highly expressed in the aortic wall and putatively involved in regulation of
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (7). However, the region also contains the perlecan
enconding HSPG2 gene which, interestingly, has a 2.5-fold higher expression in aorta than
ECE1 (227.2 TPM vs. 93.88 TPM, n=432; GTEx Portal).
Our expression data from mg‚àÜloxPneo mice with varying aortic and skeletal phenotype severity
show a positive correlation between Hspg2 and Fbn1, strengthening the hypothesis of cofunction of the corresponding proteins in those systems (12‚Äì14,18). Moreover, although we
did not find any correlation between Fbn1 expression levels and phenotype severity, we
showed that lower expression of Hspg2 is associated with more severe hyperkyphosis and
with low integrity of elastic fibers and presence of aneurysms. Thus, our findings indicate
that expression of Hspg2 may influence the severity of both skeletal and vascular phenotypes
in MFS mice.
The identification of modifier genes of monogenic diseases not only gives clues about the

molecular mechanism of pathogenesis and novel therapeutic strategies, but also contributes
to the prediction of disease severity. Here we build a case for HSPG2 as a modifier gene for
MFS by reviewing the literature and presenting corroborating evidence in our mouse model
of MFS intrafamilial clinical variability. We propose that the role of HSPG2 in modulating
the severity of skeletal and cardiovascular manifestations should be investigated in large
cohorts of MFS patients.
