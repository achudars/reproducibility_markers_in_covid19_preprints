Heritability is an important statistic for evaluating genetic contribution to phenotypes.
Estimating heritability, however, requires a laborious recruitment of a large number of
relatives. Electronic health records (EHR) contain massive relative information in
emergency contact forms. Recently, we presented RIFTEHR, an algorithm for
extracting relationships from EHR. Here, we present an updated version and
reconstructed 4.2 million familial relationships from the latest New YorkPresbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) EHR system. The
number of updated relationships is 30 percent more than the last version. We present a
new implementation of RIFTEHR, which runs in linear time, thus largely improves the
speed of the algorithm. We also present a data encryption method, to protect patient
privacy in running the algorithm. These resources can be used for generalized use of
familial relationships from EHR in genetic studies.

Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variance due to genetic differences (Tenesa &
Haley, 2013). It is valuable in identifying disease risk factors, predicting disease risk
and preventing disease (Chatterjee, Shi, & Garc√≠a-Closas, 2016). The widely used
method for estimating heritability without genetic data is family-based studies,
especially twin studies. Family-based studies, however, require laborious recruitments
of a large number of relatives, and are often limited by their sample sizes. The probable
largest single study contains 203,691 twin individuals (Mucci et al., 2016), and the
meta-analysis using 2,748 studies from 1955 includes 14.5 million people (Polderman
et al., 2015).
Electronic health records (EHR) store massive patient relationships in their emergency
contact forms. This information has not been used for genetic studies until recently. In
previous work, we successfully reconstructed familial relationship networks of three
medical centers using emergency contact information in EHR (Polubriaginof et al.,
2018). This study involved in total 1.9 million subjects, which was much larger than

Datasets
The emergency contact and patient demographics dataset were collected from
Columbia University Irving Medical Center EHR system. 823,112 patients were
involved in the analysis.

Relationship inference from the electronic health record (RIFTEHR) algorithm is used
for extracting familial relationships from EHR (Polubriaginof et al., 2018). It maps
emergency contact person to patients in the hospital database, and infers relationship
networks and families. This algorithm can be used within a single medical center, or
scaled up to integrate data from multiple institutions. But the current implementation
of the mapping step runs in ùí™(ùëõ$ ) time, thus may not be suitable for process extremely
large-scale data. Also, the current algorithm can only be run by people with access to
the identifiable data. This limits the usage of the algorithm.
In this study, we applied RIFTEHR algorithm to the latest CUIMC EHR system, and
reconstructed 4.2 million familial relationships. To adapt the algorithm for large-scale
data processing, we came up with a linear time implementation of mapping. And to
protect patient privacy, we provided a data encryption method.

Software:
Python 2.7
Julia 0.4.7
MySQL 5.7.26
Extracting relationships from EHR
Enterprise Master Patient Index (EMPI), when available or the medical record number
(MRN) is used as patient identifiers. Relationships were extracted using the RIFTEHR
algorithm (Polubriaginof et al., 2018).
Mapping emergency contact to patients
The original Python implementation was described before (Polubriaginof et al., 2018).
The new implementation preprocesses data in Python, such as lower case converting
for names, and finds exact matches for first name, last name, phone number, zip code,
or their combinations using MySQL. The output of the new implementation is the same
with the original one, including patient identifier, relationship, emergency contact
identifier and the unique match combinations.
Execution time of mapping

demographics data from CUIMC EHR system were randomly selected as input datasets
of the algorithm. Each dataset was fed to both implementations. The processor
execution time of Python scripts was calculated using the time package. And the
processor execution time of each SQL query was returned automatically in MySQL.
Time for all scripts and queries were added up as the total execution time.

Data encryption for patient privacy
The algorithm takes in the identifiable data, and output the according encrypted patient
identifier, first name, last name, phone number and zip code data. A patient identifier
and its encryption mapping table is also generated by the algorithm, for analysis which
needs linkage to phenotypes in EHR. This encryption should be done before using
RIFTEHR.

Updated familial relationships
In the following context, we refer to results from (Polubriaginof et al., 2018) as the
original or version 1, and refer to results from this study as the updated or version 2.
We retrieved emergency contact data from the latest CUIMC EHR and mapped it to the
patient demographics database. In the updated database, 1,254,790 patients provided
1,643,011 emergency contact persons, and 5,873,115 patient demographics data are
recorded. It is approximately 20 percent more than the original, which contains
1,353,045 emergency contact persons and 4,788,982 patient demographics.
Among 1.6 million emergency contact persons, we successfully mapped 1,297,768 to
patients in the database as provided relationships. Of these, 589,152 are relatives.
Utilizing provided relationships, we inferred additional 3,698,274 familial relationships.
The total number of provided and inferred relationships is 4,287,426, which is 32
percent more than the original. (Table 1)
We then grouped patients into 265,835 families. (Table 1) The family size ranges from
2 to 231, which is much larger than the original. The maximum family size is 134 in
version 1.
We further examined the degree of relationships. We got more first-degree relatives,
but less second-, third- and fourth-degree relatives than version 1. (Table 2)
The new implementation of RIFTEHR
RIFTEHR algorithm extracted relationships by mapping emergency contact
information to patient demographics data. The original Python implementation of the
mapping uses brute-force search. Assuming the number of emergency contact entries
is in direct ratio with the number of patients in the database, the complexity of the
algorithm is ùí™(ùëõ$ ). Considering the potential of data increasement in EHR, it will take

a long time to execute. In this study, mapping 1.6 million emergency contact entries to
5.8 million patients takes approximately 2 days, if using 30 threads. To overcome the
speed limitation of the algorithm, we therefore utilize SQL for mapping.

Heritability is commonly estimated by family-based studies. Sample size is one of the
key issues of these estimations. Here, we again presented the value of EHR as a
comprehensive resource to overcome limitations in genetic studies. Leveraging the
updated data from CUIMC EHR system and the RIFTEHR algorithm, we built over 4.2
million familial relationships and 260,000 family pedigrees from a single institution ‚Äì
a 30 percent increase than our previously study (Polubriaginof et al., 2018).

To compare the performance of two implementations, the execution times of various
amount of data are calculated. Emergency contact and patient demographics data are
random selected at a fixed percentage (0.5, 1, 2 or 4) of the total data, and the same
dataset is mapped using both implementations. Compared to the original
implementation, the new one significantly reduces the execution time. (Figure 1) The
complexity of the new algorithm is ùí™(ùëõ).
Data encryption for patient privacy
For those do not have access to identifiable data in EHR, we provided a data encryption
method. The method is used before running RIFTEHR to encrypt patient identifier, first
name, last name, phone number and zip code. Thus, no identifiable data is needed when
extracting familial relationships from EHR using RIFTEHR. For studies need to link
patient with data other than first name, last name, phone number and zip code in EHR,
we also generated a patient identifier and its encryption mapping table during this data
encryption.

Besides twins and siblings, we also construct the extended family, including second-,
third- and fourth-degree relatives. The distributions of relative degrees from the updated
and original CUIMC EHR data show some differences. Version 2 has an increased
number of first-degree, none and unknown relatives, and decrease in twins, second-,
third- and fourth-degree relatives. Some decrease in number of twins is due to the
integration of identifier numbers of the same patient. Decrease in second-, third- and
fourth-degree relatives, and increase in none and unknown relatives, suggest we
probably filtered out many non-blood relatives, and the data is cleaner than the original.
The EHR is a valuable source of phenotype information for scientific and health
research. Family relationships already captured by the EHR can be extracted and used
to estimate important disease parameters, like sibling co-occurrence and heritability.
Here, we improve on the previously published extraction algorithm. We created a linear
time implementation of RIFTEHR algorithm which will better scale with the data as it
continues to grow. We also provided a demographic information encryption method, to
