ABSTRACT
The widespread use of antibiotics across clinical and agricultural settings results in
strong selection pressures and contributes to the fixation of antibiotic resistance
genes, the presence of which lowers the efficacy of proven treatments for infection.
Furthermore, plasmids are often key vectors that facilitate the rapid dispersal of
antibiotic resistance genes across bacterial strains via horizontal gene transfer. In
contrast to previous widespread correlations between plasmid acquisition and
resistance to antimicrobial compounds, we demonstrate that acquisition of the P.
syringae megaplasmid pMPPla107 sensitizes strains to a conserved, bacteriostatic
small molecule produced by many Pseudomonas spp. Moreover, we find the
acquisition of pMPPla107 reduces production of the inhibitory agent. Our results
provide insights and suggest new directions to investigate collateral sensitivity to
antimicrobials due to plasmid acquisition as well as highlight costs associated to
horizontal gene transfer in the form of sensitivity to antagonistic microbial
interactions.

INTRODUCTION
Bacteria exist in complex ecological networks where interactions between
community members range from mutualistic to antagonistic. Individual strains
have therefore developed a variety of methods to interact with and/or outcompete
surrounding bacterial cells including the production of secondary metabolites that
can inhibit or allow growth of various microorganisms, as well as bacteriocins that
kill target cells with high specificity(1-9). Secondary metabolites can also provide
neighboring microbes a previously missing metabolic resource allowing for
colonization of previously uninhabitable niches (10, 11). Such interactions play a
critical role in the development and maintenance of bacterial communities under
natural conditions, but the discovery and exploitation of antimicrobials underlying
these interactions has transformed the management of infection under both clinical
and agricultural settings.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) allows for the alteration of genotypes by the rapid
acquisition of genes via mobile genetic elements like plasmids and phage. Although
acquisition of plasmids is commonly associated with beneficial effects in recipient
strains, like the colonization of new niches through genes associated with symbiosis,
virulence, and antibiotic resistance, numerous costs of plasmid acquisition have also
been identified. Phenotypic costs are typically assumed to be driven by draining of
limiting resources within the cell by plasmid borne pathways (e.g. use of ATP and
nucleotides to promote plasmid replication) or through costly protein interactions
that disrupt cellular networks(12-14), which both manifest as lower overall fitness

under permissive conditions in cells containing plasmids compared to those that are
plasmid free. Along with intracellular costs of plasmids, creation of the type IV
secretion pilus enables killing of conjugating donor cells by phage and type VI
secretion systems(12, 15). These various costs highlight the fact that most plasmids
can be considered as selfish parasites of their host cells, regardless of the potential
benefits they may provide, and that the existence of these costs may prove to be an
Achilles heel that can be exploited for the development of novel treatments to limit
the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (or any other type of gene) that can be
disseminated through plasmid conjugation.

Pseudomonas is a diverse genus of Gram-negative bacteria that includes a variety of
potential pathogens like P. syringae and P. aeruginosa. P. syringae is a
phytopathogen that causes economic loss in a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and
ornamental plants across the globe(16-18). The second species, P. aeruginosa is an
opportunistic pathogen of humans with multiple drug resistances that is a main
driver in morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients, burn victims, and the
immunocompromised(19, 20). Therefore, identifying novel methods to limit
infection by these pathogens could have dramatic impacts on clinical and
agricultural settings. Previously we found that the Pseudomonas syringae
megaplasmid pMPPla107 leads to numerous phenotypic costs when acquired by
alternative hosts including: thermosensitivity, alterations in biofilm production and
motility, and collateral sensitivity to some antibiotics (21). Understanding how HGT
can create these costly effects may enable new methods for clinical and agricultural

treatments of pathogens as well as a better understanding of HGT dynamics among
plasmids in general.

In addition to these previously identified phenotypic costs, we have demonstrated
that acquisition of pMPPla107 sensitizes strains to growth inhibition by an
unknown compound found within the supernatant of P. aeruginosa PA14.
Here we follow up on our previous publication and characterize the inhibitory
phenotype associated with pMPPla107 and the supernatant of P. aeruginosa (21).
We optimize assays for both the timing of production of and sensitivity to this
inhibitory agent, identifying organisms that produce and/or are susceptible to this
inhibitory agent, and screen to demonstrate that no mutant present within the P.
aeruginosa PA14 transposon mutant library tested eliminates production of this
compound. Fluorescence microscopy experiments further reveal that cells were not
lysed when treated with the inhibitory agent, indicating the compound has
bacteriostatic properties. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS)
we identify a mass of interest with a fraction with growth inhibition properties. This
body of work demonstrates a unique system where a large mobile element
sensitizes cells to a common molecule produced by Pseudomonads and provides
further evidence of widespread phenotypic costs that accompany HGT.

METHODS
Collection of Supernatants

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/537589; this version posted January 31, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

All strains used in this report are listed in Table 1 (DOI:
doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7627334.v1). Pseudomonas strains and E. coli were
grown in various media types and used in this work for the collection of
supernatants (Table 1). Additionally, these Pseudomonas strains (Table 1) were
grown on bacterial overlays. Although these strains carry various antibiotic
resistance loci, antibiotics were not used in the bacterial overlay assays to reduce
unwanted inhibitory affects from antibiotics.

To collect supernatants single colonies were picked from agar plates containing the
strain’s preferred media type to 2mL of the organism’s preferred media type
overnight with shaking (200rpm) at either 27˚C or 37˚C dependent on the organism
(Table 1). Media types used were Salt Water-LB (SW-LB), Lysogeny broth (LB), or
King’s medium B (KB) and their recipes can be found at:
dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.xf3fjqn. Cells were then diluted 1:100 to fresh
media in the same media type previously used and allowed to grow for either 24 or
48 hours (Table 1) with shaking (200rpm) at preferred 27˚C or 37˚C (unless
specified) to reach saturation based off previous growth curves(22) and turbidity.
Saturated cells were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 minutes. Supernatants
were collected and were filter sterilized by passing samples through a 0.22µm filter
using a syringe. Samples were stored at 4˚C.

Bacteriocin Isolation

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/537589; this version posted January 31, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

aCC-BY-NC 4.0 International license.

Bacteriocin induction and isolation was carried out as per Hockett et al (7). P.
syringae B15 cultures were made in 3mL of KB with shaking (200rpm) at 27˚C for
24 h and were then diluted 1:100 to fresh KB media the next day. Cultures were
allowed to grow for approximately 4 h or until slight turbidity was visualized and at
which point mitomycin C was added to a final concentration of 0.5µg/mL. Cultures
were then allowed to grow over night and were filter sterilized with a 0.22µm filter
and stored at 4˚C.

Physical Characterization of the Inhibitory Agent
Filter sterilized supernatants containing the inhibitory agent or isolated
bacteriocins were treated with proteinase K (proK), autoclave, or precipitated with
PEG 8000 to determine the presence of proteins. For proK treatment, the inhibitory
agent or isolated bacteriocins were mixed with proK to a final concentration of
1.0mg/mL (Invitrogen) and mixtures were incubated at 37˚C for 2 h. ProK was then
heat inactivated by incubation of samples at 95˚C for 10 min. The inhibitory agent
and bacteriocins were heat treated by autoclaving samples at 121˚C for 15 min at 30
psia. Concentration of larger molecules within supernatants followed a
polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation protocol previously published by Hockett et
al(7). Briefly, samples are mixed with NaCl (to a 1M final concentration), incubated
on ice for 30min, mixed with PEG 8000 (10% final concentration) and left on ice for
1 h, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4˚C, and pellets are suspended in buffer
(0.01 Tris, 0.01 M MgSO4, pH 7) at 0.1 or 0.01 the original volume.

Bacterial Overlay
A single colony was picked from an agar plate containing the strain’s preferred
media type and allowed to grow overnight in 2mL of preferred media (SW-LB, KB,
LB) at 27˚C with shaking. The following day cells were diluted 1:100 (30µL
cells:2.97mL media) into fresh media and allowed to grow for 48 h at 27˚C with
shaking and 200rpm. After 48 h of cell growth, all cultures are diluted 1:100 (30µL
cells:2.97mL media) to fresh KB and allowed to grow for 4 h at 27˚C with shaking.
Cultures are then mixed 1:10 (300µL cells:2.7mL agar) with molten 0.4% agar and
poured onto a KB agar plate. Plates were allowed to solidify for 15 min, at which
time 10 µL spots of either the inhibitory agent or the bacteriocin were spotted onto
the agar. Spots were allowed to dry and plates were incubated at 27˚C for 16-24 h.

Bacterial Conjugations With pMPPla107
Biparental bacterial conjugations were performed using a P. syringae (DBL328)
pMPPla107 and a recipient strain, either DBL73 or DBL306, in a 1:1 ratio
(750µL:750µL). Cells were mixed and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 3min and
supernatants were removed by decanting without disturbing the pellet. Pellets
were washed and reconstituted in 1mL of 10mM MgCl2. Centrifugation and washing
steps were repeated. 10µL and 100µL samples of reconstituted sample were spread
to a KB plates containing selection for pMPPla107 and the recipient strain using
either Rif50µg/mL and Kan30µg/mL (DBL73) or Tet10µg/mL, Cm30µg/mL, and
Kan30µg/mL (DBL306) and grown for 24-48hr at 27˚C. Resistant colonies were

grown in liquid culture containing the same antibiotic combination and using
diagnostic primers(21) PCR was performed for the presence of pMPPla107.
Resistant cells that resulted in amplification were preserved at -80˚C in 40%
glycerol.

Liquid Chromatography
After 48hr of growth, Pseudomonas stutzeri 28a24 (DBL408)(21) supernatants
prepared as above were separated via Agilent Zorbax 300 SB-C18, 5um, 250 x
2.10mm column using Paradigm MS4B - multi-dimensional HPLC separations
module (Michrom BioResources, Inc., Auburn, Calif.) with UV detection @220nm via
WellChrom spectrophotometer K-2501 (Knauer; Berlin, Germany) inline with Gilson
FC 203B fraction collector (Gilson, Inc., Middleton, WI). The mobile phases
0.1%Formic acid (FA)/H2O (A) and 0.1% FA/ACN (B) were delivered at a flow rate
of 200 µl/min with the following gradient: 5%B (0-2.0 min), from 5 to 100% B (2.030.0 min), 100%B (30.0 – 35.0 min), from 100 to 5%B (35.0-35.2 min), 5%B (35.240 min).

6ul of sample/per injection were fractionated into 1.5min fractions, the fractions
were dried down in a vacuum centrifuge, reconstituted in 10µL of sterile H2O and
spotted onto overlay plates to test for the presence of inhibitory activity against
pMPPla107 (DBL408) as per above.

Low-resolution Mass Spectrometric (MS) Analysis

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/537589; this version posted January 31, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

MS analysis of supernatant fractions collected from liquid chromatography was
performed using Bruker Daltonics amaZon SL Ion Trap mass spectrometer (Bruker
Daltonics Inc, Billerica, MA) by direct infusion. The fractions were vacuum
centrifuged until dry and reconstituted in 10µL of H2O and tested for inhibitory
activity against pMPPla107 (DBL408) on an overlay plate as previously described.
LC-MS analysis of the analyte was performed via amaZon as well with the sample
introduction via the ThermoFisher Scientific UltiMate 3000 HPLC system using the
same column and the gradient as described in “Liquid chromatography” section.

Replication and screening of the P. aeruginosa PA14 Transposon Mutant
Library
P. aeruginosa PA14 transposon mutant library plates from the Ausubel Lab at
Harvard(23) were replicated using LB with the suggested antibiotic according to the
manual (http://pa14.mgh.harvard.edu/pa14/downloads/manual.pdf) was added to
three round-bottomed 96 well micro titer plates using a peristaltic pump. Plates
were inoculated and grown at 37˚C and 100% humidity with shaking to eliminate
evaporative loss. Humidity was measured using a hygrometer. After 24 hours of
growth 50µL of 80% glycerol was added to all daughter replicate plates. Replicate
plates were sealed with sterile aluminum covers and transferred to a Beckman
Coulter Biomek FX to mix glycerol by shaking of plates for 1 min. Replicate plates
were frozen at -80˚C.

Library plates were revived in 96 well micro titer plates with 175µL of LB with
gentamicin (15ng/µL) for the MAR2xT7 transposon, or kanamycin (30ng/µL) for the
PhoA transposon for 24 hours at 37˚C with shaking at 100% humidity. 75µL were
transferred to a 96 well polypropylene PCR plate (TempPlate, USA Scientific) and
sealed with a sterile aluminum seal (Aluma Seal II, Excel Scientific). Sealed plates
were sterilized by heating cells to 95˚C for 10min in a thermocycler. 5µL from each
well was spotted onto an overlay plate with cells containing pMPPla107 (DBL494).
Overlay plates followed a similar protocol as above, except that a larger petri dish
(150mm x 50mm) was used and requires 900µL of cells mixed with 8.1mL of molten
agar.

Fluorescence Microscopy
Following the overlay protocol above, cells grown for 4hr in KB were than mixed 1:1
with P. stutzeri supernatant or a negative control (KB) for 15min. Afterward 3µL of
the mixed LIVE/DEAD kit (L7012, Invitrogen) was added to the samples and mixed
thoroughly. Samples were placed on a CELLview TC treated, one compartment,
sterile culture dish (Greiner) and viewed under a Lecia DMI6000 inverted
microscope. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 and Lecia LAS-X
software.

Results
Sensitivity is Dependent on Media Type and Growth State

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/537589; this version posted January 31, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

To ensure reprocibility across numerous assays, we first sought to characterize and
optimize sensitivity to the previously identified inhibitory agent. Using strain
DBL408 as an indicator and strain DBL736 as a producer, we found that both media
type and time to plating are critical for successful overlays. Inhibitory activities of P.
aeruginosa supernatants appear more distinct and clear against strain DB408 when
plating overlays onto KB compared to LB agar (Figure 1) and we therefore decided
to use KB media for overlays of the target strains.

Because antibacterial sensitivity is increased during log phase we also tested
different growth times when plating target strains to an overlay to optimize efficacy
of the inhibitory agent(24, 25). After cells were grown with shaking to saturation,
they were diluted 1:100 (cells:media) and plated after 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours of growth
at 27˚C. Our results indicate that strains that lack pMPPla107 show no difference in
sensitivity to the supernatant between all time points in the absence of pMPPla107,
while strains containing the megaplasmid have distinct zones of inhibition at 4 and
5 hours of growth while hours 2 and 3 have weaker activity (Figure 2). However,
we further note that inhibitory activity could no longer be clearly visualized if cells
were grown for longer than 5 hours (Data not shown). Therefore, for the
remainder of assays reported here, strains were grown for 4 hours prior to overlay
plating unless specified.

Production of the Inhibitory Agent Correlates With P. stutzeri Growth

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/537589; this version posted January 31, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

aCC-BY-NC 4.0 International license.

To optimize collection of the inhibitory agent, we collected supernatants over a
range of time points during growth of the producer strain. Production of the
inhibitory agent occurs within log phase around hour 6(26). We found that
inhibitory activity increases at hours 12 and 16, but that inhibition from 16 hour old
cultures appears similar to that at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 3). Given these results
we collect filter-sterilized supernatants between hours 24-48 from this point on
unless otherwise specified.

Acquisition of pMPPla107 Sensitizes Strains Most Across the Pseudomonas Phylogeny
to the Inhibitory Agent
Previously the only strain tested for sensitivity to the P. aeruginosa supernatants
was DBL408 (DBL386+pMPPla107) and DBL386, yet there is also data suggesting
that pMPPla107 can conjugate to other Pseudomonas spp.(21, 26). Therefore, we
tested whether sensitization to the inhibitory agent by acquisition of pMPPla017
varied across the Pseudomonas phylogeny (Figure 4). According to these assays, we
found that sensitization is present if pMPPla107 is acquired by P. stutzeri, P.
syringae, and P. fluorescens. However, the sensitization phenotype appears to be
absent in P.putida.

The Inhibitory Agent is Not a Protein
Bacteria utilize various methods to inhibit the growth of neighboring
microorganisms that include both proteins and small molecules. To determine the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/537589; this version posted January 31, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

molecular nature of the inhibitory agent we pulled down P. aeruginosa supernatants
with PEG 8000, treated supernatants with proK, and autoclaved supernatants. As a
protein control for treatments with proK and heat we isolated bacteriocins from P.
syringae pv. B15 which has known killing activity of P. syringae pv.
morsprunorum(7). Treatment with proK and autoclaving eliminates activity of the
P. syringae bacteriocin, but the inhibitory agent that targets pMPPla107 remains
active (Figure 5). Furthermore, PEG 8000 is used to precipitate and concentrate
large molecules including proteins, but our results indicated that activity was
reduced after PEG precipitation (Supplemental Figure 1). Together these data
indicate that the inhibitory agent, which specifically targets pMPPla107, is not a
protein and is likely to be a relatively small molecule.

Identification of a 530.70 m/z With Inhibitory Activity Against pMPPla107
We fractionated raw supernatants to identify the molecule responsible for the
inhibitory activity using liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Although
UV chromatograms revealed that the samples were complex, 3 fractions
demonstrated inhibition of pMPPla107 (Figures 6A-B). MS analysis of fraction 1
revealed a distinct peak occurring at a mass of 530.72 in positive mode and 528.70
in negative mode indicating a potential mass of 530.70 for the inhibitory agent. We
were further able to determine a retention time of 15.5min using LCMS (Figure 6C
Supplemental Figures 2 and 3). This retention time allowed us to eliminate various
peaks from fraction 1 as LCMS analysis revealed peaks only present for masses of
513, 530, and 551 with retention times of 15.5min (Supplemental Figure 4).

However, due to low concentrations of the suspected molecule we were unable to
isolate enough sample for structural analysis with NMR.

No Mutants Tested from the PA14 Mutant Library Eliminate Production of the
Inhibitory Agent
To identify a potential genetic basis for production of the inhibitory agent we
replicated and developed a high throughput screening method of the entire P.
aeruginosa PA14 non-redundant transposon mutant library(23). After isolating
supernatants and screening 5,364/5,459 mutants against P. stutzeri with
pMPPla107 (DBL494), we found that none of the transposon mutants eliminated or
reduced activity against DBL494 (Table 2 DOI:
doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7390235.v1 and Supplemental Figure DOI:
10.6084/m9.figshare.7631585). 95 mutants were missing from the library, as these
were lost in the transfer and replication process.

Multiple Pseudomonas Species’ Supernatants Display Inhibitory Activity
Since the transposon screen suggests that production of the inhibitory agent is
potentially an essential gene in P. aeruginosa, we hypothesized that this gene or
pathway may be conserved across Pseudomonads. Therefore, we collected
supernatants from various isolates across the pseudomonas phylogeny and found
that production of the inhibitory agent is indeed conserved when tested against
DBL408 (Figure 7). However, we also observed variations in production capabilities
of different species. For instance, P. putida and P. fluorescens appear to produce the

inhibitory agent at higher concentrations or produce a secondary killing agent that
inhibits growth of non-megaplasmid strains (Figure 7). P. fluorescens supernatants
are still more effective against strains containing pMPPla107 than those lacking
pMPPla107 indicating that the megaplasmid still demonstrates sensitizing effects to
the stationary phase supernatants of Pseudomonads (Figure 7).

To determine if inhibitory agent is a common product produced by other bacteria,
we also tested the supernatant of E. coli against DBL386 and DBL408. Zones of
inhibition were not observed indicating that the supernatants of saturated E. coli do
not contain inhibitory properties against DBL386 or DBL408 (Figure 7).

Carriage of pMPPla107 Reduces Production of the Inhibitory Agent
We also hypothesized that if supernatants from various Pseudomonads inhibit the
growth of pMPPla107 carrying strains, then megaplasmid acquisition could reduce
production of the inhibitory agent. Our data indicate that the inhibitory agent
activity is reduced in all tested supernatants collected from strains with pMPPla107
when compared to the supernatants of identical strains without pMPPla107 (Figure
7). Furthermore, this is not a product of differences in growth as all strains have
reached saturation after 24 or 48hr of growth (Table 1). Although variation in the
efficacy of the inhibitory phenotype occurs, all strains produce a similar diffuse
inhibitory phenotype against strains carrying pMPPla107. Furthermore, acquisition
of pMPPla107 results in reduced production of the compound across all species
tested (Figure 7).

The Inhibitory Agent is Bacteriostatic
Preliminary data in the lab suggested that the inhibitory agent is not bactericidal. To
determine if the inhibitory agent has bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity we mixed
filter sterilized supernatants containing the inhibitory agent with cells grown for
four hours and stained the mixtures with SYTO9 and propidium iodide. SYTO9 is a
green-fluorescent nucleic acid stain and will penetrate living cells while propidium
iodide is a non-permeable nucleic acid stain that only stains cells with damaged
membranes red-fluorescent. When mixing cells containing pMPPla107 with the
inhibitory agent we found no observable cells with damaged membranes. These
data suggest that the inhibitory agent is a growth inhibitor and does not kill cells at
the naturally produced concentration.

DISCUSSION
In this body of work we find that acquisition of pMPPla107 confers sensitivity to a
non-proteinaceous small molecule compound that is resistant to both protease K
and heat treatments(21, 27, 28). Furthermore, this inhibitory agent is conserved
across Pseudomonads, is likely part of an essential or redundant pathway, and the
concentration of the compound is positively correlated with the amount of time
Pseudomonas spp. grow under laboratory conditions. These results suggest that the
inhibitory agent is a commonly produced molecule among Pseudomonas spp. that
may be a toxic secondary metabolite but that it is not produced by species like E.
coli.

Due to the unknown nature of the P. aeruginosa supernatants on pMPPla107
containing strains, we optimized preferred media types and growth times to allow
for clear and distinct overlays so that these methodologies can be used in future
analyses of this phenotype. P. fluorescens and P. putida strains produced the
inhibitory agent at higher levels when grown in KB media than in LB. Furthermore,
KB was also the preferred media among all strains tested for obtaining clearer zones
of inhibition when compared to LB. Therefore, nutrients found in KB medium may
affect the metabolism of Pseudomonads to increase flux to pathways responsible for
production of the inhibitory agent. Therefore, further analyses utilizing minimal
media for plating overlays and the production of the inhibitory agent may give
further insight into the metabolic pathways necessary for production and sensitivity
characteristics of pMPPla107 and the inhibitory agent.

The inhibitory agent produced by P. stutzeri increases at a similar rate as growth in
rich media, a characteristic shared by quorum sensing molecules. Quorum Sensing
molecules are also known to recognize inter and intraspecies interactions and can
induce several types of responses in bacteria including production of antibiotics(2,
29-33). All quorum sensing pathways are represented in the PA14 transposon
mutant library and screening of this library revealed no single knockout in quorum
sensing pathways that eliminated or reduced production of the inhibitory agent.
Furthermore, the screened library did not reveal a single knockout, which
eliminated production of the inhibitory agent. This can be explained by three

possibilities: 1) the inhibitory agent is the product of redundant pathways requiring
multiple knockouts, 2) one of the 335 genes without representation in the library
produces the inhibitory agent (See Table 5 in Liberati et al.)(23), thus a knockout is
not present in the library, or 3) the knockout mutation is present in one of the 95
mutants lost in testing. Therefore, the lack of inhibitory activity in E. coli
supernatants against pMPPla107 strains could be due to an essential gene unique to
Pseudomonas spp., which is not present in E. coli.

Although nutrient deprivation can elicit antagonistic stress responses in cells, this
response is not typically induced in clonal populations (such as a pure culture)
except in a case where population density and spread were shown to be regulated
by active self-lysis via secreted proteins in low-nutrient environments(2, 8, 34).
Here we report a set of different results that demonstrate an inhibitory agent
isolated from a clonal population with rich nutritional resources inhibits the growth
of nearly identical bacteria with the addition of pMPPla107, yet does not inhibit
itself. One possibility for this outcome is that pMPPla107 carries a gene sensitive to
the conserved inhibitory agent, which results in bacteriostatic growth inhibition.
The inhibitory agent could also share a similar role to a previously mentioned selflysing growth regulation system(34), where pMPPla107 is more susceptible to such
a signal due to the burden and fitness costs it imposes on the cell. In this case the
expectation would be that costs like decreased thermotolerances, decreased biofilm
production, and increased antibiotic sensitivities previously found(21) would be
correlated with sensitivity to the inhibitory agent. Cellular networks are complex

and heavily regulated to maintain fitness, and the introduction of a megaplasmid
carrying nearly a thousand genes could disrupt these pathways causing previously
benign compounds to result in toxicity through over accumulation of a specific
product or byproduct.

Addiction systems are small genetic elements that encode a stable toxin that can
several cellular processes (e.g. transcription, translation, and ATP synthesis) and a
less stable, but more abundant antitoxin(35). Plasmids commonly encode addiction
systems as a means of self-preservation, as host cells will commonly attempt to cure
plasmids without selective benefits. pMPPla107 carries multiple toxin/antitoxin
systems that could is likely used for maintenance of the megaplasmid in microbial
communities do to it’s low copy number(26, 36). Therefore, the inhibitory agent
may interact with one of these cellular processes in conjunction with the toxins
present on pMPPla107 resulting in additive negative effects on host cells causing
growth inhibition. Whether this is a self-governing system being disrupted or truly
antagonistic behaviors against pMPPla107 is still to be seen, but can be resolved by
our ongoing attempts to identify the active inhibitory molecule through LC-MS and
nuclear magnetic resonance analyses.

Acquisition of plasmids can contribute to several costs including protein
interactions that disrupt cellular networks resulting in cytotoxic effects due to
improper protein dosing, alteration to metabolic flux, or sequestration of RNA
polymerases(12, 13, 37-39). Sensitization to the inhibitory agent by pMPPla107

offers yet another insight into cost associated HGT by demonstrating a direct cost to
strains that have recently acquired pMPPla107 within a community. Given a
pseudomonas community of cells bearing pMPPla107 and those lacking it, this
inhibitory agent will be present within the community actively inhibiting growth of
cells containing pMPPla107 and is therefore interesting that pMPPla107 conjugates
efficiently within the lab and in nature(26, 36). However, we also demonstrate that
acquisition of pMPPla107 reduces production of the inhibitory agent suggesting that
perhaps this cost can be overcome with reduction of this compound coupled with
high conjugation efficiency and retention.

Utilizing an interdisciplinary set of methods, we build upon our previous publication
regarding a unique inhibitory phenotype(21) and find that pMPPla107 increases
sensitivity to a small molecular growth inhibitory compound, is conserved across
the pseudomonas phylogeny, and the gene responsible for its production is either
redundant or essential. This suggests a highly conserved toxic compound that is yet
another cost associated with pMPPla107 and a potential defense mechanism against
this megaplasmid. Furthermore, we demonstrate through fluorescence microscopy
that the molecule has bacteriostatic properties, indicating that at the naturally
produced concentrations the inhibitory agent is a growth inhibitor to pseudomonas
cells with pMPPla107. The data presented here provides foundational knowledge of
a system to pursue in depth analyses centered on how horizontally transferred
elements can alter microbial interactions, result in antibacterial costs, and
potentially be utilized as a mobile sensitivity system.
