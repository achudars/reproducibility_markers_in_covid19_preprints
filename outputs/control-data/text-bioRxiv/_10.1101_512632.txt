Abstract

As a first line of defence against the environment, the epidermis protect animals from infection and

physical damage. In C. elegans, wounding the epidermal epithelium triggers both an immune reaction and a
repair response. Exactly how these are controlled, and the degree to which they are inter-connected remains
unclear. To address these questions, we established a simple system for simultaneously inflicting precise
laser wounds and imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution. We show that in C. elegans, wounding
provokes a rapid sealing of the plasma membrane, involving reorganisation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate domains. This is followed by a radial recruitment at the wound site of EBP-2/EB1, a protein
that binds the plus ends of microtubules. EB1 recruitment is accompanied by a reorganisation of
microtubules, required for the subsequent recruitment of actin and wound closure. It is also required for the
directed trafficking towards the site of injury of the key signalling protein SNF-12. In the absence of SNF-12
recruitment, there is an abrogation of the immune response. Our results suggest that microtubule dynamics
coordinate the cytoskeletal changes required for wound repair and the concomitant activation of the innate
immune response.

Introduction
Inducible immune responses are ubiquitous features of animal defences against infection. In one wellstudied example, when the fungus Drechmeria coniospora infects Caenorhabditis elegans, by piercing the
cuticle and growing through the underlying epidermis, it triggers an innate immune response, characterized
by the induction of expression of a battery of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (Pujol et al., 2008b; Taffoni
and Pujol, 2015). These include the genes of the nlp-29 cluster (Pujol et al., 2012), which are principally
controlled in a cell autonomous manner (Lee et al., 2018). Sterile wounding also upregulates the expression
of the nlp-29 cluster (Pujol et al., 2008a). In both cases, these changes in gene expression result from the
activation of the GPCR DCAR-1 that acts upstream of a conserved p38 MAPK signalling cassette (Zugasti et
al., 2014). The p38 MAPK PMK-1 itself acts upstream of the STAT transcription factor-like protein STA-2.
Although the precise details are as yet unclear, activation of STA-2 is believed to require the SLC6 family
protein SNF-12 (Dierking et al., 2011).
Triggering the immune response upon wounding has a prophylactic role, and is a safeguard against
the potential entry of pathogenic microbes. To ensure longer term protection, a wounded tissue must also
be repaired to maintain organismal integrity. Thus in addition to AMP gene induction, skin wounding in C.
elegans also triggers a Ca2+-dependent signalling cascade that promotes wound repair through actin ring
closure (Xu and Chisholm, 2011). The nematode skin is mainly a syncytium, except at the head and tail, a
single multinucleate epidermal cell, hyp7, covers the whole animal (Altun and Hall, 2014). Its repair processes
exhibit some of the characteristics previously described for single cell wound repair in other organisms
(Sonnemann and Bement, 2011). On the other hand, actin ring closure in C. elegans does not rely on myosinII contractility and the “purse string” mechanism described in other organisms, but instead requires Arp2/3dependent actin polymerization.
A small number of reports have indicated that MTs cooperate with the actomyosin cytoskeleton
during wound closure. In a single-cell wound-healing model using Xenopus laevis oocytes, MTs were shown
to be required to restrict the assembly zone of actin and myosin around the wound edge (Bement et al.,
1999; Mandato and Bement, 2003). A study in which D. melanogaster embryos were used also revealed that
perturbation of MT dynamics, in a + end-binding protein 1 (EB1) mutant, resulted in a delay of actomyosin
assembly at the wound edge in multi-cellular wounds (Abreu-Blanco et al., 2012). The direct role of MTs in
the C. elegans wound response has not been previously addressed.
The tissue repair processes in C. elegans have been described to act in parallel to the innate immune
response that accompanies wounding (Xu and Chisholm, 2011). Several pieces of evidence suggest, however,
a coordination of the two responses. Earlier work had shown that loss of DAPK-1, homolog of deathassociated protein kinase, causes both undue tissue repair and an inappropriate activation of an immune

response (Tong et al., 2009). A more recent study showed that loss of dapk-1 function causes excessive
microtubule (MT) stabilization (Chuang et al., 2016). These results suggest that MT stability could directly
influence immune signalling.
Here, we develop the use of a 405 nm laser to wound the C. elegans epidermis and characterise the
subsequent subcellular events in vivo. We show for the first time a rapid membrane reorganisation of
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) domains, as well as a recruitment of EB1 and reorganisation of
MTs. We demonstrate that specific inactivation in the adult epidermis of several alpha and beta tubulin
isotypes leads to the abrogation of the immune response upon wounding or infection. Indeed, tubulin
inactivation leads not only to decreased recruitment of actin at the wound site, but also of the key signalling
protein SNF-12 and a block of the subsequent immune response. These results suggest that recruitment and
stabilisation of MTs to wounds coordinate the activation of the innate immune response and wound repair.

Results
The C. elegans epidermis can be wounded with a 405 nm laser
The adult epidermis in C. elegans is a single cell layer, covered on its apical surface by an impermeable
cuticle that serves as an exoskeleton. The epidermal syncytium hyp7 can be divided into two distinct regions,
one lateral, where the nuclei and most of the cytoplasm are, and the dorso-ventral part above the muscles
where the apical and basolateral plasma membranes of hyp7 are juxtaposed and crossed by
hemidesmosomes that anchor the muscles to the cuticle exoskeleton (Fig. 1A) (Altun and Hall, 2014). The
large size of hyp7 make it an attractive model for the study of cellular wound repair mechanisms (Pujol et
al., 2008a; Xu and Chisholm, 2011). Previous studies on Xenopus oocytes have demonstrated that the plasma
membrane can be perforated in an extremely targeted manner using standard 405 nm microscopy imaging
lasers (Burkel et al., 2012; Mandato and Bement, 2001). We found that we could efficiently wound the hyp7
lateral syncytial epidermis of C. elegans (Fig. 1A) with a short pulse (1-3 s) of 405 nm laser light in
Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) mode (22 mW). Coupled with spinning disc microscopy,
this provides a reproducible way to monitor in vivo the immediate consequences of a carefully controlled
injury and the subsequent steps in the wound healing process. Using this system, we first confirmed all the
previously described wound hallmarks (Pujol et al., 2008a; Xu and Chisholm, 2011), such as an immediate
autofluorescent scar (Fig. S1A), a Ca2+ burst (Fig. 1B), the formation of an actin ring (Fig. S1B) and later the
induction of AMP reporter gene expression (Fig. S1C).

Membrane is rapidly reorganised at the wound site
In Xenopus oocytes, a wound is rapidly patched through mobilisation and recruitment of membrane
from a local pool of vesicles. We could similarly observe rapid membrane recruitment at the wound site in
the epidermal syncytium using a strain expressing a prenylated form of GFP (dpy-7p::GFP::CAAX). Within 15
sec after wounding, large heterogeneous membrane domains regrouped and extended towards the wound
(Fig. 2A, Movie 1). PIP2 has been found segregated into distinct membrane pools in the plasma membrane in
other species, consistent with its wide range of cellular functions including regulating the adhesion between
the actin-based cortical cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane (Raucher et al., 2000). We found that the
plasma membrane of the hyp7 syncytium was also heterogeneously labelled using a strain in which PIP2 was
specifically labelled (wrt-2p::GFP::PH-PLC1δ (Wildwater et al., 2011)). Upon wounding, we observed a rapid
reorganization of these membrane domains around the wound (Fig. 2B, Movie 2). These processes are likely
to provide an immediate barrier to potential leakage of cellular components as previously proposed in other
systems (Davenport et al., 2016; Vaughan et al., 2014).

Actin and MTs reorganize at the wound site forming concentric rings
Wounding the C. elegans epidermis causes cytoskeleton rearrangements, with an actin ring forming at
the wound site (Xu and Chisholm, 2011). We wanted to monitor the dynamics of actin recruitment and so
constructed a strain in which the filamentous actin binding peptide Lifeact (Riedl et al., 2008), labelled with
mKate, was specifically expressed in the adult epidermis (col-62p::Lifeact::mKate) (Fig. 3A). Under resting
condition in the young adult, in the lateral epidermis, we observed a disorganised dot-like pattern, with only
occasional fine actin filaments (Fig. 3A, bw (before wound)). This is in contrast to the highly organised
circumferential bundles of actin found in the same hyp7 cell above the muscles, as previously described
(Costa et al., 1997; Lazetic et al., 2018). Upon wounding, while the pre-existing actin filaments appeared
stable, actin was recruited to the wound site within 2-4 minutes and formed a well-defined actin ring after 5
minutes. This subsequently constricted as the wound closed (Fig. 3A and Movie 3), in line with previous
observations (Chuang et al., 2016).
Microtubules (MTs) are another essential component of the cytoskeleton, but their role in wound
healing has not previously been addressed directly in C. elegans. To look at MT dynamics, we imaged worms
expressing a tagged form of EB1/EBP-2, a protein that binds to the + end of growing MTs (col-19p::EBP2::GFP; EB1::GFP for brevity). Under resting conditions EB1::GFP exhibited rapid, comet-like movement
throughout hyp7, with a speed (0.26 ± 0.10 µm/sec, Table 1) close to that determined in a recent study (0.3
µm/sec) (Chuang et al., 2016). Upon wounding, EB1::GFP comets accumulated within 2 min around the
wound site (Fig. 3B and Movie 4). This was concomitant with a reduction of their average speed in the vicinity
of the wound, to 0.16 ± 0.06 µm/sec (Table 1), indicative of a local stabilisation of MTs.

To confirm that EB1 dynamics reflected local MT reorganization at the wound site, we used 2
independent strains where one of the 16 C. elegans tubulin proteins, TBB-2, was labelled with GFP (Si [col19p::GFP::TBB-2] and KI [tbb-2p::TBB-2::GFP]; here termed TBB-2::GFP). We observed that MTs were
arranged essentially in a longitudinal but haphazard manner in the lateral epidermis, in marked contrast to
their parallel and circumferential organisation in the dorso-ventral epidermis, over the muscle quadrants (Fig.
3C), as previously described (Costa et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2015). The MTs in the lateral epidermis were
highly dynamic. Consistent with our observations using EB1::GFP, after wounding they locally regrew to
surround the site of injury (Fig. 3C and Movie 5). The dynamic recruitment at the wound site of EB1::GFP and
TBB-2::GFP was visualised with a temporal projection (Fig. 3D-E), confirming that EB1 massive recruitment is
linked to growth of MT around the wound. To visualise simultaneously actin and MTs dynamics, we generated
two strains, each containing two reporter transgenes, either EB1::GFP or TBB-2::GFP with Lifeact::mKate. We
observed that actin and MTs formed partially overlapping concentric rings and that the EB1::GFP ring was
circumscribed by actin (Fig. 3F-G and Movie 6 & 7). As assayed with EB1::GFP, MTs grew in front of the actin
ring as it closed (Fig. 3H). These results are consistent with MT reorganisation driving actin ring formation.

tba-2 or tbb-2 inactivation results in abrogation of EB1 dynamics in the epidermis
To test whether MT growth at the wound site does promote actin polymerization, we sought a way to
block MT dynamics prior wounding the epidermis. Due presumably to their impermeable cuticle, treatment
of adult worms with commonly used drugs, such as colchicine, was either ineffective or had irreproducible
effects in our hands. Although inactivating various genes that affect cuticle formation can increase
permeability and so render C. elegans more susceptible to drugs (Loer et al., 2015; Partridge et al., 2008),
this uniformly affects the epidermal innate immune response (Dodd et al., 2018; Zugasti et al., 2016). We
therefore used RNAi to interfere directly with tubulin gene expression. Since eliminating MTs provokes
developmental delay and lethality, worms were subjected to a relatively brief (24 h) RNAi treatment from
the L4 stage. Under these conditions, worms completed their development normally and exhibited no overt
morphological defects. We chose one tubulin alpha tba-2 and one tubulin beta tbb-2, as these genes have
been reported to be highly expressed in the epidermis (Cao et al., 2017; Hutter and Suh, 2016). In young
adult tba-2(RNAi) or tbb-2(RNAi) worms, EB1::GFP comets were no longer visible suggesting that MT
dynamics had been severely compromised (Fig. 4A and 4B and Fig. S2A). Interestingly, this effect was specific
to the epidermis (hyp7) since highly motile comets were still visible in the seam cells (Fig. 4B). Upon
wounding, EB1::GFP was not recruited to the wound site (Fig. 4A and 4C). This suggests that constant
expression of tba-2 and tbb-2 genes is required for the normal dynamic behaviour of the non-centrosomal
MTs in the epidermal syncytium as well as the redistribution of MTs caused by injury.

Abrogation of MT dynamics decreases actin recruitment at the wound site
To address the question whether MTs are required for the formation of the actin ring, we analysed
actin ring formation upon wounding in tbb-2(RNAi) worms. In resting conditions in young adult worms, short
abrogation of tbb-2 altered the MT network; it became less dense and less longitudinally structured in the
lateral epidermis (Fig. 4D). Upon wounding these worms, less actin was recruited around the wound (Fig. 4DE). Moreover, the actin ring did not constrict as quickly as in wild type worms, as measured by the area inside
the ring after 15 min (Fig. 4D & F). Interestingly, the relationship between MTs and actin was not reciprocal.
Thus reduction of the level of actin via inactivation of act-5 did not change the overall pattern of MTs nor EB1
dynamics (FigS2 A&B). This suggests that the dynamic reorganisation of MTs around the wound is indeed
important for actin ring closure and might helps driving it.

Microtubule dynamics is required for the immune response
We had previously demonstrated in a genome-wide RNAi screen that knocking down certain genes
associated with MT function, including tba-2 and tba-4, leads to an abrogation of the induction of the AMP
gene reporter nlp-29p::GFP usually caused by Drechmeria coniospora infection (Table S1, (Zugasti et al.,
2016)). We found more precisely that targeted and short inactivation just before the adult stage of these 2
tubulin α genes led to a block of AMP induction after infection in the adult (Fig. 5A). In addition, we showed
that tba-2 and tba-4 are also required for AMP reporter gene induction after wounding (Fig. 5A). MTs are
formed by dimers of tubulin, each consisting of two subunits, tubulin α and tubulin β. In the C. elegans
genome, there are 9 α (TBA) and 6 β (TBB) genes. Some have been shown to act in specific cells or tissue,
such as mec-7 (β) and mec-12 (α) in the mechanosensory cells (Savage et al., 1989), other are predicted to
be ubiquitously expressed, and several to be expressed in the epidermis (Harris et al., 2010). We extended
our investigation to all tubulin genes by assaying the effect of individually knocking down their expression by
RNAi specifically in the adult epidermis. In addition to tba-2 and tba-4, we found that inactivation of tubulin
β genes tbb-1 and tbb-2 was also associated with a block of AMP reporter gene induction upon infection (Fig.
5B-C). We found that this was not a consequence of reduced spore binding to the worm cuticle (Fig. S3).
Using the TBB-2::GFP strain, we also showed that inactivation of the genes that blocked the immune response
altered the pattern of MTs, confirming the expression and functional importance of these isoforms in the
adult epidermis (Fig. S2C).
On the other hand, a targeted short inactivation of tubulin-γ (TBG-1) expression did not affect AMP
reporter gene induction nor the overall MTs pattern (Fig. 5C and Fig S2C). Since tubulin-γ nucleates MTs at
their minus end (Quintin et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015), this suggests that unlike MT + ends, – ends are less
dynamic in the adult epidermis and are not required for the immune response upon wounding. Thus,
independent of their role in the maintenance of epidermal structure, and in addition to a function in

mediating wound closure upon wounding, MT + end dynamics appear to be required for the regulation of
the transcriptional response to injury and fungal infection in the epidermis.

SNF-12, RAB-5 and RAB-11 get locally recruited upon wounding
We hypothesised that microtubules could be required for controlling the subcellular localization of key
signalling molecules that are necessary for the induction of the epidermal immune response. The SLC6 family
member SNF-12 was a prime candidate, as we have previously shown that it is localized in clusters in the
apical surface of the hyp7 syncytium (Dierking et al., 2011). We therefore characterised further the
localization of SNF-12 and its behaviour following wounding. We performed colocalization analysis between
SNF-12::GFP and available vesicular and plasma membrane markers (early, late and recycling endosomes,
lysosomes, plasma membrane lipids). We did not, however, detect any colocalization (Fig. 6A-B, Fig. S4). On
the other hand, we observed that SNF-12 clusters were in the same focal plane as early, late and recycling
endosomes (Fig. 6A, Fig. S4 & S5) and PIP2 (Fig. 6B). This indicates that SNF-12 is in a yet-to-be defined apical
membrane compartment. Interestingly, in the dorso and ventral epidermis, SNF-12 was found in a banded
pattern, like the highly organised circumferential cytoskeleton (Fig. 6C, Movie 7). Compared to EB1 and RAB11, see below, the majority of SNF-12 clusters were static or just vibrating, with only very few moving longer
straight distances, presumably along MT tracks, with a low speed of 0.017 ± 0.005 µm/sec (Fig. 6D, Movie 8,
Table 1).
When we wounded worms carrying the SNF-12::GFP reporter, we observed a progressive recruitment
of SNF-12 to the wound site (Fig. 6E-F, Movie 9), with the majority of the clusters around the wound moving
in a directed manner at a low speed of 0.007 ± 0.004 µm/s (Table 1). A similar recruitment was also seen in
several other strains containing different tagged forms of SNF-12 (Fig. S6) suggesting that it reflects the
behaviour of the endogenous protein. When we disrupted MTs, via RNAi of tba-2, SNF-12 patterning and
recruitment were severely compromised (Fig. 6G-I). Similarly, both MT and SNF-12 patterning and dynamics
upon wounding were also affected when the MT severing protein SPAS-1 was overexpressed in the worm
epidermis (Fig. S7). Together, these results suggest that MTs play an important role in SNF-12 localization
and dynamics and thereby in the induction of AMP gene expression.
The behaviour of SNF-12 was unusual as in almost all cases when we wounded strains in which vesicles
markers were fluorescently tagged, there was no such recruitment (Fig. S5). Thus the movement of SNF-12
towards the wound site was not simply a reflection of cytoskeleton rearrangements or cytoplasmic flow. Two
exceptions were RAB-5, a marker of early endosomes, and RAB-11. RAB-5::GFP appeared localised in large
static donut-shaped structures (0.3-0.8 µm) arranged in a reticular pattern, exchanging with smaller vesicles
(0.2-0.4 µm), as described previously (Chuang et al., 2016) (Fig. 7A, Movie 10). Upon wounding these small
vesicles accumulated around the wound site within 10-15 min (Fig. 7A, Movie 11). RAB-11::GFP was found in
extremely motile (1.31 ± 0.33 µm/s) vesicles (0.2-0.4 µm) (Table 1). They moved long distances in one

direction, presumably on microtubule tracks (Fig. 6D, Movie 12). Upon wounding they started to accumulate
around the wound site within 10-15 min (Fig.7B, Movie 13) and reached a maximum density between 30 and
60 min post wounding. Notably, we previously demonstrated that both rab-5 and rab-11 are required nonredundantly for the epidermal innate immune response to infection (Dierking et al., 2011; Zugasti et al.,
2016). Together, these results suggest that the innate immune response requires coordinated recruitment
of both endosomal vesicles and the uncharacterised SNF-12-associated clusters, which is in turn dependent
upon MT reorganisation.

Discussion
Previous studies of wound healing in C. elegans used either imprecise and irreproducible mechanical
injury, with a needle, or sophisticated laser rigs not accessible to many laboratories. We demonstrated that
a simple FRAP laser can be used to induce wounds with high precision, and can be combined easily with fast
image acquisition. Using this system, we observed in the C. elegans epidermis the phenomenon of rapid
membrane reorganisation previously described in Xenopus (Davenport et al., 2016) suggesting that these
initial steps of plasma membrane repair, as well as subsequent steps in wound healing (Nakamura et al.,
2018), may be conserved throughout Metazoans.
In addition to the acute patching of the membrane, wounding was followed by reorganisation of PIP2
domains. PIP2 is known to influence the adhesion between the actin-based cortical cytoskeleton and the
plasma membrane (Raucher et al., 2000). Thus, its redistribution could be linked to the dramatic changes in
the actin cytoskeleton that occurred in the minutes after wounding. The C. elegans epidermis is bounded on
its apical side by a rigid collagen-rich cuticle that serves as an exoskeleton. As in plant cells, this is likely to
give the structural support that is provided by a highly organised cortical actin network in most animal cells
(Salbreux et al., 2012). This may explain why cortical actin is not organized in the adult lateral epidermis.
During moulting, however, when the cuticle is remodelled, a highly organized actin cytoskeleton comprised
of circumferential bundles forms transiently, disappearing when the new cuticle is formed. This parallels the
situation in the epidermis upon injury. Actin is rapidly assembled around the wound, and disassembled once
it is repaired. Thus changes in membrane tension, either linked to alterations of the cuticle during
development, or caused by a breach in its integrity are closely linked to cytoskeleton dynamics.
Wound repair has been previously suggested to involve a recapitulation of developmental programs
(Martin and Parkhurst, 2004; Razzell et al., 2014). Thus for example, in the syncytial Drosophila early embryo,
wound closure occurs through a myosin-II dependent purse-string mechanism, driven mainly by the
contractile force exerted by myosin (Bement et al., 1999,Abreu-Blanco, 2011 #4455). This parallels the tight

control exerted by myosin on the actin cytoskeleton during morphogenetic cell shape changes in Drosophila
embryogenesis (Lecuit and Lenne, 2007). In Xenopus oocytes, if myosin motor activity is inhibited, however,
wounds still close, even though at a much slower rate. The residual force driving wound closure is thought to
be given by the treadmilling of actin, with a preferential recruitment of Rho GTPase towards the wound
(Burkel et al., 2012).
Actin-dependent processes, including cell migration and cell protrusion, can be influenced by MT
dynamics. The mechanisms that underlie their functional crosstalk are still being characterised (Dogterom
and Koenderink, 2018). For example, a recent in vitro study showed that the MT + end-associated protein
CLIP-170, together with the formin mDia1, can accelerate the actin filament polymerization which occurs at
the tip of growing MTs (Henty-Ridilla et al., 2016). We showed here that in C. elegans the recruitment of MT
+ end binding protein EB1 to the wound precedes that of actin. We further demonstrated that perturbation
of MT dynamics in vivo slows actin ring closure in C. elegans epidermis. Together, this suggests that MTs
could facilitate actin ring closure. This MT-dependent mechanism, which is independent of myosin-based
contractility (Xu and Chisholm, 2011), could arise because the epidermis is bounded by a rigid apical
extracellular matrix, the tensile cuticle exoskeleton.
Injuring the epidermis not only leads to wound healing, but also provokes an innate immune response.
Previous results in C. elegans suggested that the pathways involved in these 2 processes were distinct. Thus,
although mutants for the p38 MAPK PMK-1 and for the SARM orthologue TIR-1, which acts upstream of the
p38 cascade, are defective for the induction of AMP gene expression after wounding (Pujol et al., 2008a),
they exhibit normal actin ring closure (Xu and Chisholm, 2011). If innate immune signal transduction pathway
components are not required for wound repair, our results suggest, on the other hand, that cytoskeleton
components can play a role in regulating AMP production. Indeed, several tubulin genes are required for
AMP expression upon infection and wounding, potentially through their effect on the localization and
dynamics of innate immune signalling proteins including SNF-12. The fact that overexpression in the
epidermis of the MT severing protein Spastin caused a similar effect on SNF-12 dynamics as knocking down
tubulin expression, supports a role for MT in positioning SNF-12-containing vesicles. Determining the precise
nature of these vesicles, their connection with MTs and the mode of SNF-12 activation remain challenges for
the future.
A further link between cytoskeleton reorganization and AMP production comes from the study of the
protein DAPK-1, a negative regulator of both wound closure and innate immune gene expression (Tong et
al., 2009). Interestingly, dapk-1 mutants have defects in the epidermis that were shown to result from the
hyperstabilization of MTs. DAPK-1 inhibits the function of PTRN-1, a MT - end binding protein, which acts as
a MT nucleator and promotes MT stabilization. Loss of ptrn-1 function suppresses the epidermal defects seen
in dapk-1 mutants as well as their constitutive AMP gene expression and accelerated wound closure. Loss of

dapk-1 function is associated with an increase in EB1 comets. This too is suppressed in a dapk-1;ptrn-1 double
mutant (Chuang et al., 2016). Taken together with our results, this suggests that the accelerated wound
healing seen in dapk-1 mutant worms may be due to an increased recruitment of EB1 protein thus speeding
up MT-dependent actin ring closure.
The cytoskeleton is an assembly of co-regulating components that function together in a precise and
dynamic way. Our results suggest that this co-regulation extends to the coordination of physical changes
required for membrane wound healing and immune signal transduction driving transcriptional responses to
injury.

frSi9 is a single copy insertion on chromosome II at the location of the Nemagenetag Mos1 insertion
(Vallin et al., 2012) ttTi5605 of pNP151 (col-62p::Lifeact::mKate_c-nmy3’utr). pNP151 was obtained by
insertion of the col-62 promoter fused to Lifeact::mKate (Reymann et al., 2016) into the MosSCI vector
pCFJ151 (Frokjaer-Jensen et al., 2008). It was injected into the EG6699 strain at 20 ng/µl together with pCFJ90
(myo-2p::mCherry) at 1.25 ng/µl, pCFJ104 (myo-3p::mCherry) at 5 ng/µl, pMA122 (hsp16.41p::PEEL-1) at 10
ng/µl, pCFJ601 (eft-3p::Mos1 transposase) at 20 ng/µl and pNP21 (unc-53pB::GFP) at 40 ng/µl. A strain
containing the insertion was obtained following standard selection and PCR confirmation (Frokjaer-Jensen et
al., 2008).
frSi13 is a single copy insertion on chromosome II (ttTi5605 location) of pNP159 (dpy-7p::GFP::RAB-11)
by CRISPR using a self-excising cassette (SEC) (Dickinson et al., 2015). pNP159 was obtained by insertion of
dpy-7p::GFP::RAB-11 (kindly provided by Grégoire Michaux) into the pNP154 vector. pNP154 was made from
a vector containing the SEC for single insertion on Chromosome II at the position of ttTi5605 (pAP087, kindly
provided by Ari Pani). pNP159 was injected in N2 at 10 ng/µl together with pDD122 (eft-3p::Cas9) at 40 ng/µl,
pCFJ90 (myo-2p::mCherry) at 2.5 ng/µl, pCFJ104 (myo-3p::mCherry) at 5 ng/µl, and #46168 (eef-1A.1p::CAS9SV40_NLS::3’tbb-2 (Friedland et al., 2013)) at 30 ng/µl. Non-fluorescent roller worms were selected then heat
shocked to remove the SEC by FloxP as described in (Dickinson et al., 2015). Plasmid and primers sequences
are available upon request.
Different transgenic strains containing several tagged version of SNF-12 were generated including
IG1784

frEx597[pSO16(col-12p::SNF-12::mKATE_3’unc-54),

pCFJ90(myo-2p::mCherry],

IG1270

frEx453[pMS8(col-12p::GFP::STA-2), pMS9(col-12p::mCherry::SNF-12)] and IG1663 frEx577[pNP158(snf12p::SNF-12::GFP_3'snf-12, pCFJ90(myo-2p::mCherry), pCFJ104(myo-3p::mCherry)]; all strains are given in
Table S2.

Infection and needle wound
Eggs prepared by the standard bleach method were allowed to hatch in 50 mM NaCl in the absence of
food at 25 °C. Synchronized L1 larvae were transferred to NGM agar plates spread with E. coli OP50 and
cultured at 25 °C until the L4 stage (40 hours) before being exposed to fungal spores on standard NGM plate
spread with OP50, as previously described (Pujol et al., 2001). To count the number of spores, young adult
worms were infected for 8 hours at 25 °C then observed on a slide under the microscope. Statistical
significance was determined using ANOVA Bonferoni’s test (Graphpad Prism). Needle wounding was
performed as previously described (Pujol et al., 2008a) with a standard microinjection needle under a
dissecting microscope by pricking the worm posterior body or tail on agar plates; worms were analysed after
6h.

Fluorescent reporter analyses
Analysis of nlp-29p::GFP expression was quantified with the COPAS Biosort (Union Biometrica;
Holliston, MA) as described in (Pujol et al., 2008a). In each case, the results are representative of at least 3
independent experiments with more than 70 worms analysed. The fluorescent ratio between GFP and size
(time of flight; TOF) is represented in arbitrary units. Statistical significance was determined using a nonparametric analysis of variance with a Dunn’s test (Graphpad Prism). Fluorescent images were taken of
transgenic worms mounted on a 2 % agarose pad on a glass slide anesthetized with 0.01 % levamisole, using
the Zeiss AxioCam HR digital colour camera and AxioVision Rel. 4.6 software (Carl Zeiss AG).

RNAi
The RNAi bacterial clones were obtained from the Ahringer library (Kamath et al., 2003) or Vidal library
(Rual et al., 2004) and sequenced to confirm their identity using CloneMapper (Thakur et al., 2014). RNAi
feeding experiments were performed at 25 °C and the RNAi clone sta-1 was used as a negative control. To
avoid developmental delay or lethality, RNAi experiments of tubulin or actin genes were either performed
from L4 stage or in IG1327 (rde-1(ne219) V; juIs346[col-19p::RDE-1, ttx-3p::GFP] III; frIs7[nlp-29p::GFP, col12p::dsRed] IV) worms (Zugasti et al., 2016) allowing gene silencing specifically in the epidermis from the L4
stage.

Image acquisition and laser wound
Since in preliminary experiments we observed that immobilization using latex beads impacted vesicle
and protein dynamics in the epidermis, young adult worms (containing less than 5 eggs) were immobilized
on a slide using 0.01 % levamisole. Time lapse and/or Z stack were acquired using two different spinning disk
microscopes: an inverted Visitron Systems GmbH spinning disc with a Nikon 40X oil, 1.3 NA objective and
1.5X lens, and a Roper inverted spinning disc with a Nikon 100X oil, 1.4 NA objective. The two systems acquire
images using Visitron and MetaMorph, respectively. Laser wounding was performed by using an imaging 405
nm laser (22 mW) operating in a FRAP mode, using either Visitron or iLas FRAP Systems, respectively. 1-3 sec
of laser pulses were applied on a circular region of interest (ROI) of 21 x 21 pixels with the Nikon (~1.68 µm
in diameter) or 8 x 8 pixels with the Visitron (~2.13 µm in diameter) on the apical plane of the lateral
epidermis either left or right of the seam cells. Each worm was wounded from 1 to 3 times, if possible
sequentially on opposite sides of the seam cells. Time lapse acquisitions were 15 to 20 min long. Each Z stack
was acquired every 15 sec and the Z size was 0.3 or 0.5 µm. High temporal resolution was obtained on one
single plane with a time interval of 0.2 to 0.5 ms. Laser wound was performed between the first and the
second Z stack. For colocalization analysis, we initially controlled that there was no signal cross talk using
single labelled strains. We then performed sequential acquisitions on the strains expressing 2 fluorescent
proteins. Experiments requiring comparative analysis were performed on the same day.

Image analysis
All image processing was done using Fiji software. A custom Image J macro was used to correct for
focus z-drift during the 20 min acquisitions. XY drift was corrected either with the “Image Stabilizer” plugin
from ImageJ or the online available macro “NMSchneider/FixTranslation”.
To analyse EB1 density before wounding, we manually counted fluorescent dots as described in
(Chuang et al., 2016), in a 300 µm2 ROI in the lateral hyp7 or in an 80 µm2 ROI in the seam cell in 5 worms per
RNAi condition. Similarly, we measured SNF-12 cluster density in the lateral hyp7, analysing 6 worms per
RNAi condition. Quantification of EB1 recruitment at the wound site was performed by measuring the
RawIntDen (sum of the pixel intensities) of a selected ROI of 256 µm2 for EB1 centred at the wound site. Since
EB1 brightness differed before wounding between worms, for each single wound, only pixels with values
above a defined brightness threshold were considered, the threshold being set to the [mean + 3 x standard
deviation] in the ROI before wounding. Quantification of SNF-12 recruitment was performed by measuring
the mean intensity of a selected ROI of 18 µm2 centred at the wound site at specific time points. Statistical
significance was determined using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (Graphpad Prism).
To visualise the speed and directionality of EB1, RAB-11 and SNF-12, a temporal projection was done
using a temporal-Color code (plugin from Kota Miura) on 120 frames over 2 min (1 frame per second) before
and on 32 frames over 10 min after wounding for SNF-12. To analyse the speed of recruitment of EB1 versus
actin, the radial profile (plugin from Paul Baggethun) was calculated, after determination of the centroid of
the wound for each time point by manually selecting the wound area. For each radial profile, we extracted
the radius corresponding to the maximum intensity and plotted this radius versus time.
To analyse particle motility before and after wounding, we used the macro KymographClear described
in (Mangeol et al., 2016). For EB1, RAB-11 and SNF-12, we acquired movies with time interval of 300 ms, 400
ms and 200 ms, respectively. Since SNF-12 was observed to move much slower than the other dynamic
proteins studied, a substack with a time interval of 20 s was generated. SNF-12 quantifications were done for
particles with a minimum displacement of 5 pixels within 120 sec for before wounding and within either 210
or 420 sec for after wounding.
To analyse actin ring closure, an ROI of 80 pixels2 located on the centre of the wound was selected 15
mn post wounding. The area inside the actin ring was detected using the Huang automatic threshold method
from Image J.

Figure legends

Fig. 1: Using a 405 nm laser to wound the worm epidermis.
(A) Schematic view of a section through an adult C. elegans worm near the mid-body. The main syncytial
epidermis, hyp7 (buff), with its adjacent cells (seam cells in pink, nerve cord in red and muscles in green)
can be divided into 2 main regions, the lateral epidermis (delimited by the dashed black line) and the thin
dorso-ventral epidermis where muscles are anchored to the cuticle. Microtubules (thin taupe lines) are
disordered on the apical surface of the lateral epidermis. The typical position of a wound is indicated by the
yellow circle. Figure adapted from one kindly provided by Christopher Crocker, WormAtlas (Altun and Hall,
2014). (B) Wounding the lateral epidermis with a 405 nm laser causes a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+,
measured using GCamp3. Representative green fluorescence images from a worm carrying a col19p::GCamp3 reporter transgene. Here and in subsequent images, the dashed circle is centred on the
wound site; bw, before wound (200 ms); pw, post-wound; sc, seam cells. Scale bar 10 µm.

Fig. 2: Membrane and lipid domain reorganization at the wound site.
Upon laser wounding, membrane and lipids are rapidly recruited to the wound site. The red arrows
highlight examples of vesicle fusion. Representative images of worms carrying dpy-7p::GFP::CAAX (A) and
wrt-2p::GFP::PH-PLC1δ transgenes (B). bw, before wound; time post-wound [min:sec]; sc, seam cells. Scale

Fig. 3: Cytoskeleton reorganization at the wound site in the lateral epidermis.
(A) In unwounded worms, in the lateral epidermis actin is sparsely structured. Laser wounding causes actin
recruitment (as early as 2.5 min) and actin ring formation (clearly visible by 5 min). These rings close with
time. Representative images of a strain carrying a col-62p::Lifeact::mKate reporter. Laser wounding also
causes EB1 recruitment and MT reorganization (highlighted with red arrows) at the wound site as visualized
in strains carrying col-19p::EBP-2::GFP (B) and TBB-2::GFP (C), respectively; d, dorsal epidermis. After
wounding, EB1 (D) and MT (E, highlighted with red arrow) reorganise around the wound as represented
with a colour coded temporal projection (0.2 s or 15 s frame interval, respectively). (F-G) MT congregation
precedes actin accumulation. Simultaneous visualization of MT (green) and actin (red) using strains carrying
EB1::GFP (F) or TBB-2::GFP (G) together with col-62p::Lifeact::mKate. The white arrows indicate
representative MT bundles. bw, before wound; time post-wound [min:sec]; scale bar 5 µm. (H) EB1 (green)
ring contraction precedes that of actin (red) during wound closure. Radial profile where the radius between
the maximum intensity is represented over time for EB1 in green and actin in red.

Fig. S1: Reproduction of known wound hallmarks following injury using a 405 nm laser.
Wounding C. elegans lateral epidermis with a 405 nm laser causes immediate formation of an
autofluorescent scar (A) and later an actin ring, revealed with the actin-binding protein GFP::moesin (B) at
the wound site. Representative images of wild-type (A) and col-19p::GFP::moesin (B) worms. The dashed
circle is centred on the wound site; bw, before wound; pw, post wound; sc, seam cells. Scale bar 10 µm
except in the inset 5 µm. (C) 3 hours after wounding, young adult worms exhibit an increased expression of
a nlp-29p::GFP reporter, a read out of the immune response (right), compared to unwounded worms (left).
The worms express dsRed constitutively in the epidermis. Red and green fluorescence are visualized here
simultaneously.

Fig. S2: Tubulin is required for non-centrosomal MT organisation and dynamics in the lateral
epidermis.
TBB-2 but not ACT-2 is required for the normal pattern of EB1 comets (A) and MTs (B). Representative
images of (A) EBP-2::GFP KI worms (white star point to mechanosensory axons), or (B) TBB-2::GFP (top) and
Lifeact::mKate (bottom) transgenes, after short temporal inactivation of control (sta-1; ctrl), tbb-2 and act-5
genes; scale bar 10 µm. (C) RNAi against tba-2, tba-4, tbb-1 and tbb-2, but not tbg-1 alters the pattern of
MTs in the adult epidermis. Representative images of worms expressing TBB-2::GFP after short temporal
inactivation of a ctrl, tba-2, tba-4, tbb-1, tbb-2 and tbg-1 genes; scale bar 10 µm.

Fig. S3: Worms are efficiently infected after knock-down of tubulin gene expression by RNAi.
(A) Representative white-field images of IG1327 worms after infection with D. coniospora for 18 h. Before
infection worms were fed with RNAi clones against different tubulin-α, β and γ isoforms. Each RNAi clone
was tested 4 times. Scale bar 100 µm. (B) Table summarising the mean value of the number of spores
adhering to the infected worms, after 18 h of D. coniospora infection.

Fig. S4: SNF-12 does not colocalize with RAB-11 or LAAT-1.
Colocalization analyses to compare SNF-12 localization with known vesicular markers. Recycling endosomes
(A) and lysosomes (B) are visualized as RAB-11 (A) and LAAT-1 (B) positive vesicles, respectively. SNF-12 did
not colocalize with these markers. SNF-12 was in the same focal plane as the most apical RAB-11 recycling
endosomes (A) and apical to LAAT-1 positive lysosomes (B). Z indicates the different focal planes.
Representative images of dpy-7p::GFP::RAB-11; col-12p::SNF-12::mKate (A) and col-12p::SNF-12::GFP; ced1p::LAAT-1::mCherry (B). Scale bar 5 µm.

Fig. S5: SNF-12 exhibits a specific dynamic behaviour upon wounding.
Unlike early endosomes (A-B) or late endosomes (C) visualized with SNX-1 (A), RME-8 (B) and RAB-7 (C)
reporter proteins, respectively, upon wounding, SNF-12 clusters are locally recruited to the wound site.

Representative figures of col-12p::SNF-12::GFP; snx-1p::mRFP::SNX-1 (A), col-12p::SNF-12::GFP; RME8::mRFP (B) and col-12p::SNF-12::GFP; ced-1p::mCherry::RAB-7 worms (C). The dashed circle is centred on
the wound site; time post wound [min:sec]; scale bar 5 µm.

Fig. S6: SNF-12 recruitment towards the wound site is observed using different chimeric reporter
proteins.
Representative images of worms carrying col-12p::SNF-12::mKate (IG1784; A), col‐12p::mCherry::SNF‐12
(IG1270; B), snf-12p::SNF-12::GFP (IG1663; C) transgenes. In (B), the large aggregates and filaments that are
observed in addition to the SNF-12-positive clusters are probably artefacts due to the known propensity of
mCherry to aggregate. The dashed circle is centred on the wound site; time post wound [min:sec]; scale bar
5 µm. (D) Recruitment of SNF-12 and RAB-11 at the wound results in clusters that do not greatly overlap.

Fig. S7: Spastin-1 overexpression drastically alters MT and SNF-12 dynamics before and after
wounding.
Overexpression of the severing protein Spastin (SPAS-1) in the epidermis under the control of the dpy-7
promoter (spas-1 O/E) affects both EB1 and SNF-12 patterning and recruitment towards wounds.
Representative images of worms carrying col-19p::EBP-2::GFP (A) and col-12p::SNF-12::GFP; col19p::GFP::TBB-2 (B) without and with the dpy-7p::SPAS-1 construct (upper and lower panels, respectively)
before and after wounding. The dashed circle is centred on the wound site; time post wound [min:sec]; scale
bar, 5 µm.
