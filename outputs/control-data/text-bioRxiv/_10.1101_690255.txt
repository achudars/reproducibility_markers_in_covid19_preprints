Abstract
Gap junctions are key mediators of the intercellular communication in cardiac tissue,
and their function is vital to sustain normal cardiac electrical activity. Conduction
through gap junctions strongly depends on the hemichannel arrangement and
transjunctional voltage, rendering the intercellular conductance highly non-Ohmic.
Despite this marked non-linear behavior, current tissue-level models of cardiac
conduction are rooted on the assumption that gap-junctions conductance is constant
(Ohmic), which results in inaccurate predictions of electrical propagation, particularly in
the low junctional-coupling regime observed under pathological conditions. In this work,
we present a novel non-Ohmic multiscale (NOM) model of cardiac conduction that is
suitable for tissue-level simulations. Using non-linear homogenization theory, we develop

a conductivity model that seamlessly upscales the voltage-dependent conductance of
gap junctions, without the need of explicitly modeling gap junctions. The NOM model
allows for the simulation of electrical propagation in tissue-level cardiac domains that
accurately resemble that of cell-based microscopic models for a wide range of junctional
coupling scenarios, recovering key conduction features at a fraction of the computational
complexity. A unique feature of the NOM model is the possibility of upscaling the
response of non-symmetric gap-junction conductance distributions, which result in
conduction velocities that strongly depend on the direction of propagation, thus
allowing to model the normal and retrograde conduction observed in certain regions of
the heart. We envision that the NOM model will enable organ-level simulations that are
informed by sub- and inter-cellular mechanisms, delivering an accurate and predictive
in-silico tool for understanding the heart function.

Author summary
The heart relies on the propagation of electrical impulses that are mediated gap
junctions, whose conduction properties vary depending on the transjunctional voltage.
Despite this non-linear feature, current mathematical models assume that cardiac tissue
behaves like an Ohmic (linear) material, thus delivering inaccurate results when
simulated in a computer. Here we present a novel mathematical multiscale model that
explicitly includes the non-Ohmic response of gap junctions in its predictions. Our
results show that the proposed model recovers important conduction features modulated
by gap junctions at a fraction of the computational complexity. This contribution
represents an important step towards constructing computer models of a whole heart
that can predict organ-level behavior in reasonable computing times.

Introduction

1

The conduction of electrical waves in cardiac tissue is key to human life, as the

2

synchronized contraction of the cardiac muscle is controlled by electrical impulses that

3

travel in a coordinated manner throughout the heart chambers. Under pathological

4

conditions cardiac conduction can be severely reduced, potentially leading to reentrant

arrhythmias and ultimately death if normal propagation is not restored properly [1]. At

6

a subcellular level, electrical communication in cardiac tissue occurs by means of a rapid

7

flow of ions moving through the cytoplasm of cardiac cells, and a slower intercellular

8

flow mediated by gap junctions embedded in the intercalated discs. Gap junctions are

9

intercellular channels composed by hemichannels of specialized proteins, known as

10

connexins, that control the passage of ions between neighboring cells [2]. The regulation

11

of ionic flow through gap junctions has been established for a variety of connexin types

12

and hexameric arrangements, which under dynamic conditions result in a markedly

13

non-linear relation between the electric conductance and the transjunctional voltage [3],

14

revealing a non-ohmic electrical behavior. Further, it has been shown that ionic flow

15

through cell junctions can take up to 50% of the total conduction time in cultured

16

strands of myocytes with normal coupling levels [4], and that conduction velocity is

17

predominantly controlled by the level of gap-junctional communication [5], which

18

highlights the key physiological relevance of gap-junction conductivity and coupling in

19

tissue electrical conduction.

20

Cardiac modeling and simulation has strongly motivated the development of

21

tissue-level mathematical models of electrophysiology, as they have the ability to

22

connect subcellular mechanisms to whole-organ behavior [6]. To date, the vast majority

23

of continuum models assume a linear conduction model of spatial communication, based

24

on the assumption that electrical current in cardiac tissue follows Ohm’s law, i.e, that

25

current is linearly proportional to gradients in the intracellular potential [7, 8]. From a

26

mathematical perspective, the assumption that conduction in cardiac tissue follows

27

Ohm’s law is conveniently represented by a linear diffusion term when stating the local

28

statement of current balance in a continuum, where gradients are modulated by a

29

conductivity tensor that is independent of the local electrical activity. Further, if the

30

conductivity tensor is assumed isotropic, a Laplacian operator acting on the

31

transmembrane potential arises, and the electrophysiology model takes the form of a set

32

of nonlinear reaction-diffusion partial differential equations, otherwise known as the

33

cable (monodomain) model of cardiac electrophysiology [9].

34

Using two-scale asymptotic homogenization techniques, analytic expressions have

June 28, 2019

35

been obtained for the effective conductivity tensor, which is then used to model the

36

electrical current in an average macroscopic sense [10–12]. To this end, periodicity at

the microstructural level of cardiac tissue is assumed, and a representative tissue unit is

38

partitioned in regions of high and low conductivity that represent the cytoplasm and

39

intercalated discs with gap junctions, respectively. While this approach allows for the

40

explicit consideration of regions with decreased conductivity, e.g. membranes where flow

41

is mediated by gap junctions, Ohm’s law is still assumed to hold throughout the

42

microstructural domain [13]. As a result, the non-Ohmic behavior of gap junctions and

43

their impact on tissue-level conduction continues to be neglected [14]. In particular, it

44

has been shown that continuum models that consider effective conductivity tensors

45

described above fail to capture the slow conduction of electrical impulses in cases of low

46

gap-junctional coupling [12, 15], limiting their applicability to the simulation of

47

pathological conditions in excitable tissue. Alternatively, non-linear diffusion models

48

that replace the laplacian term in the monodomain equations by either a fractional

49

laplacian [16, 17] or a porous-medium-like diffusive term [8, 18], which have shown to

50

modulate the shape of propagating waves and other restitution properties. However,

51

these models are largely based on phenomenological grounds, and are not able to

52

directly incorporate physical microscopic information, neither have been assessed for

53

cases of low junctional coupling.

54

In this work, we present a multiscale continuum model of cardiac conduction that

June 28, 2019

55

accounts for the nonlinear communication between adjacent cells. We argue that the

56

explicit consideration of the non-ohmic behavior of gap junctions can be seamlessly

57

embedded into continuum tissue-scale models of electrophysiology using an asymptotic

58

homogenization approach, which delivers nonlinear continuum equations for

59

characterizing the electrical conduction in excitable media.

Results

61

The effect of gap-junctional coupling (GJc) on conduction is studied by down-scaling

62

the maximal gap-junction conductance from 100% to 0.5%. The cardiac strand is

63

excited on one end with a current whose amplitudes that varied between 10 µA/mm2 to

64

35 µA/mm2 , which elicits a propagating pulse from left to right. Our results are

65

compared with those obtained from the cell-chain model of Kucera et al. [5], which we

66

consider as the baseline, an with the predictions from a linear homogenization model

(LHM), which considers a standard cable model where the effective conductivity results

68

from linear homogenization theory [12]. We note here that the cell-chain model results

69

in a dynamical system with 642 degrees of freedom, using cell segments of 10 µm,

70

whereas the LHM and the HOM models employ only 65 degrees of freedom, equivalent

71

to a spatial discretization of 100 µm.

72

Figure 1 shows the propagating wavefronts that result from the three conduction

73

models under different coupling levels. For GJc=100% we observe that the three models

74

predict a very similar wavefront and wave speed. When GJc was reduced to 10% the

75

LHM results in propagating waves that considerably drift ahead of the baseline, whereas

76

the NOM delivers a very good prediction of the wavefront when compared to the

77

baseline. For the case of very low coupling (GJc=1%), the NOM wavefronts display a

78

positive drift from the baseline, but still deliver a much better prediction than the LHM

79

model. The conduction velocity as a function of the reduction in GJc is reported in

80

Figure 2(a). Both the LHM and NOM capture a marked decrease in conduction as the

81

GJc is decreased, but the LHM consistently overestimates the conduction velocity,

82

resulting in larger relative errors when compared to the NOM, particularly for GJc <

83

50%, see Figure 2(b).

Waveform and conduction speed are recovered by both LHM and HOM models at high
levels of transjunctional coupling, but substantial differences can be observed at very
low levels of junctional coupling, with the NOM delivering a considerably better
estimate than the LHM.

Discussion

106

In this article, we study the gap-junction-mediated electrical conduction in excitable

107

cardiac tissue by means of a novel non-ohmic multiscale model. A unique feature of the

108

proposed model is that tissue-level spatial conduction is fully informed by sub-cellular

109

communication mechanisms, specifically by cytoplasmic and gap-junctional

110

conductances. While the upscaling of conduction properties in excitable media has been

111

the subject of some studies in the past using a linear homogenization theory

112

approach [10, 11], our work offers a rigorous mathematical framework that delivers an

113

effective non-linear model of conduction able to represent, at the tissue level, the

114

non-Ohmic conduction that takes place at the sub-cellular level. Despite the fact that

115

our focus has been on understanding gap-mediated communication between cardiac

116

myocytes, the present model of conduction can be extended to study the electrical

117

propagation phenomena in other areas of biology, such as the neurosciences, where

118

electrical synapsis occurring in the brain is highly regulated by neural gap junctions [19].

119

The propagating waves resulting from the NOM model resemble the wave forms and

120

wave speeds observed in simulations of cell-strand models [5] (Figure 1). In particular,

121

features that arise in propagating action potentials under decreasing levels of coupling

122

such as a steeper upstroke and a notch in the upstroke [20] are predicted by the NOM

123

model. Remarkably, this prediction is achieved at a fraction of the computational

124

complexity involved in cell-network models, as the number of degrees of freedom in the

125

NOM model are one order of magnitude smaller. An alternative approach is the use of

126

hybrid multiscale models [21], which adaptively partition the domain to solve

127

macroscopic cable equations in regions with low potential gradients and impose

128

microscopic equations of conduction in regions of high potential gradients. While hybrid

129

models can reduce the computational complexity of a simulation, they involve an

130

important increase of degrees of freedom when compared to standard homogenized

131

models. We believe that the NOM model offers the advantage of delivering accurate

132

predictions while maintaining the computational cost similar to that of standard

133

macroscopic continuum models. The balance between predictive power and

134

computational cost remains one of the main hurdles in the development of

135

patient-specific whole-heart simulations [22], which highlights the importance of

developing accurate yet efficient tissue-level models.

137

The accuracy of the NOM and LHM models is studied by determining the

138

conduction velocity for a wide range of gap-junctional coupling levels and comparing

139

these results with cell-chain simulations (Figure 2). Previous studies have confirmed

140

that the accuracy of LHM in predicting cardiac conduction consistently deteriorates as

141

the junctional conductance is decreased to low levels [12, 15]. Remarkably, the NOM

142

model is able to capture conduction under very low junctional-coupling scenarios with a

143

reasonable error (Figure 2). This feature takes particular relevance in the study of

144

cardiac disease, as the reduction of gap-junctional coupling has been correlated to a

145

marked decreased of conduction velocity [23], and slow conduction is considered one of

146

the main mechanisms of sustained reentrant arrhythmias [1, 24].

147

A unique feature of the NOM model is its ability to predict the tissue-level

148

conduction mediated by homotypic and heterotypic combinations of homomeric

149

connexons. In our simulations, action potentials resulting from gap-junction channels

150

composed by homotypic Cx43-Cx43 result in a higher conduction velocity when

151

compared to simulations considering homotypic Cx45-Cx45 channels (Figure 4(a)). This

152

result is consistent with observations from dual whole-cell patch clamp experiments,

153

where the conductance of Cx43-Cx43 channels can be twice as large as that of

154

Cx45-Cx45 channels [25]. It is important to note, however, that future developments

155

should focus in combining the gap-junction conductance distributions, as several

156

connexin types are typically co-expressed in cardiac tissue. Another interesting feature

157

of the NOM model is the possibility to upscale the effect of asymmetric distributions of

158

gap-junction conductance associated to heterotypic channels (Figure 3). Here we show

159

that such asymmetry results in propagating action potentials whose wave form and

160

wave speed strongly depend on the direction of propagation (Figure 4(b)). This

161

behavior, together with connexin coexpression, may partly explain the differences in

162

conduction velocity for normal and retrograde conduction that have been observed in

163

the sinoatrial node [26].

164

The work presented here can be extended in several directions. First, the theoretical

June 28, 2019

165

framework for the NOM model should be extended to consider the 3D case of cardiac

166

conduction. A heuristic derivation is included in Remark 2 of the S1 Appendix. Second,

167

intercellular communication mechanisms other than gap junctions should be integrated

to this theoretical framework. Sodium channels have been reported to co-localize with

169

gap junctions at the intercalated discs, creating an ephatic coupling effect that has been

170

associated to conduction during gap-junction blockage [24]. Further, the spatial

171

distribution of sodium channels around the cellular membrane and on the intercalated

172

discs has been studied using detailed cell-to-cell computational studies, to conclude that

173

channel spatial distribution strongly affect the cardiac conduction [27]. Since the

174

ephatic effect has been considered in homogenization schemes of cardiac conduction in

175

the past by including a cleft-to-ground resistance in the microscopic model of

176

conduction [12, 21], we forsee that future versions of the NOM could equally incorporate

177

this effect, potentially in 3D formulations with non-uniform distributions of channels.

178

Finally, the applicability of the NOM model should tested in the simulation of

179

conduction in the whole heart during diseased conditions [22].

right-hand side of (9) accounts for the amount of charge that leaves the intracellular

domain and enters the extracellular domain. Further, we will assume that the

214

transmembrane ionic current Iion is governed by v and by gating variables

215

w : Ω × (0, T ) → RM that modulate the conductance of ion channels, pumps and

216

exchangers, i.e., Iion = Iion (v, w), where the exact functional form of Iion will depend on

217

the choice of ionic model. The evolution of gating variables is determined by kinetic

equations of the form

equations (9) and (10) are supplemented with initial and boundary conditions for the

Conduction experiments in a cardiac strand

228

To validate the proposed NOM model we consider the cardiac conduction problem

229

described in [5], in which a strand of cardiac cells electrically connected by gap

230

junctions are represented using a circuit network. The effect of gap junctions on the

231

overall conduction is studied by varying the level of transjunctional coupling. In this

232

work, we model the propagation of electrical impulses based on (9) and (10) in a strand

233

with length L = 6.4 mm, and consider the Luo-Rudy I model of transmembrane ionic

234

current [30]. The cytoplasmic conductivity and the membrane capacitance are taken to

235

be σc = 0.667 µS and Cm = 1 µF/cm2 respectively [5]. The surface to volume ratio is

236

given by Am = 2RCG/a, where RCG = 2 is the ratio between capacitive and

237

geometrical areas and a = 11 µm is the fiber radius [5, 31]. The microscopic nonlinear

238

normalized conductance of gap junctions is assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution

239

that depends on the transjunctional voltage Vj , which takes the form [32]

where we set ε = 100 µm as the length of a cardiomyocyte, δ = 10−4 as the ratio

241

242

the cell. We let δσg =

where gjo is a representative conductance for the

245

product of the gap-junction normalized conductance gj,norm (Vj ) times an effective

conductance density and its respective plaque area, which reads

gj (Vj ) = gjmax Aj gj,norm (Vj ),

(12)

where gjmax is the maximum gap-junction conductance per unit area, and Aj is the

248

plaque area, i.e., the area where ions pass through gap junction channels. In our

249

simulations, we set gjmax = 0.3 µS/µm2 and Aj = 26 µm2 , both of which are within the

250

ranges reported in the literature and provide a good fit to data [33]. As a result, we get
