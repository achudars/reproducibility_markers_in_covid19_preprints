Abstract
The claustrum is an irregular and fine sheet of grey matter in the basolateral telencephalon
present in almost all mammals. The claustrum has been the object of several studies using animal
models and more recently in human beings using neuroimaging. It has been involved in cognition
and disease such as fear recognition, suppression of natural urges, multisensory integration,
conceptual integration, seizures, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson¬¥s disease. Nevertheless, the
function of the claustrum still remains unclear. We present a high resolution functional
connectivity study of the claustrum in order to identify its main networks. Resting state
functional and anatomical MRI data from 40 healthy subjects were analyzed; taken from the
Human Connectome Project (HCP, NIH Bleuprint: The Human Connectome Project), with
2x2x2 ùëöùëö" voxel resolution, equivalent to the high resolution tractography studies. Positive
functional connectivity was found (p<0.05, FDR corrected) between the claustrum and the insula,
anterior cingulate cortex, pre-central and postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and
subcortical areas. Our findings coincide with the results previously reported in both animal
models and studies with humans. Showing the claustrum as a profusely connected structure not
only structurally but also functionally. Evidencing the claustrum as a node participating in a
plethora neural networks.

Introduction
The claustrum is an irregular and fine sheet of grey matter in the basolateral telencephalon
present in almost all mammals. The claustrum is separated from the insular cortex by the extreme
capsule and medially from the lentiform nucleus by the external capsule (Edelstein and Denaro,
2004; Crick and Koch, 2005; Fern√°ndez-Miranda et al., 2008; Kapakin, 2011; Goll et al., 2015;
Milardi et al., 2015). Figure 1 shows in an axial view the anatomical location of the human
claustrum. Research in humans using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have revealed cortical
connections with the claustrum, which possesses projections to A) prefrontal cortex, BA 8, 9, 10,
11, 12 and 34; B) visual cortex, BA 17, 18, 19 and 39; C) sensoriomotor cortex, BA 7, 5, 1/2/3, 4,
6 and 8; and D) language areas BA 44, 45 and 31; as well as with orbitofrontal cortex, temporal
cortex, basal ganglia and amygdala (Fern√°ndez-Miranda et al., 2008; Milardi et al., 2015;
Torgerson and Van Horn, 2014). These results are consistent with the input-output of the
claustrum to cortical areas previously reported in animal model studies (Goll et al., 2015).
Based on its cellular composition and wide structural connectivity, the claustrum has been
described as a ‚Äúcornerstone of sensory integration‚Äù (Edelstein and Denaro, 2004). In a similar
way, Crick and Koch (2005) proposed the claustrum as a crucial component integrating motor
and sensory information coming from different modalities to assemble them in a single
experience; in an analogy used by Crick and Koch, the claustrum is as an orchestra conductor,
‚Äú[w]ithout the conductor, the players can still play but they fall increasingly out of synchrony
with each other.‚Äù (Crick and Koch, 2005); actually, this proposal has been one of the most
influent in the claustum literature. In addition, the claustrum has been proposed as a relevant
structure in the segregation of attention (Goll et al., 2015).
Claustrum have been involved in cognitive process such as fear recognition, suppression
of natural urges, multisensory integration and conceptual integration. The involvement of the

claustrum in such processes is the result of a different research question more than the question of
the function of claustrum by itself (Banati et al., 2000; Hadjikhani and Roland, 1998; Naghavi et
al., 2007; Lerner et al., 2009). Although it is rarely reported in the medical literature the selective
lesion of the claustrum; the claustrum has been involved in disease such as seizures, multiple
sclerosis, Parkinson¬¥s diseases and auditory hallucinations and delusions (Wada and Kudo, 1997;
Kalaitzakis et al., 2009; Cascella et al., 2011; Cascella & Sawa, 2014; Klaver et al., 2015; Patru
& Reser, 2015).
Resting-state functional connectivity has provided a useful tool to characterize the
functional network of the claustrum. Examining resting state functional connectivity allows us to
determine the correlation between the spontaneous activity of brain areas that are anatomically
separated, observing if there is ‚Äú(‚Ä¶) functional communication between brain regions (‚Ä¶)‚Äù (van
den Heuvel and Pol, 2010) which is important in cognitive processes. A Recent study in humans,
show the functional connectivity between the claustrum and anterior cingulate, prefrontal, visual
cortex and parietal cortices; suggesting the association of the claustrum with cognitive control.
This study also reported functional connectivity between the claustrum and posterior cingulate
cortex, precuneus, angular gyrus, cuneus, visual cortex, and sensorimotor cortex, as well as with
subcortical structures such as thalamus and nucleus accumbens among others (Krimmel et al.,
2019).
The claustrum literature ‚Äì including studies in animal model and in humans ‚Äì has
evidenced the vast anatomical connections between the claustrum and the entire cerebral cortex
as well as with the subcortical structures (Eldestein & Denaro, 2004; Fern√°ndez-Miranda et al.,
2008; Torgerson and Van Horn, 2014; Mathur 2014; Milardi et al., 2015; Goll et al., 2015; Qadir
et al., 2018); and more recently Krimmel et al., (2019) contributed to this goal, examining the
functional connectivity of the claustrum. Nevertheless, we do not have a clear or complete

understanding on the function of the claustrum beyond of the theoretical proposals (Eldestein &
Denaro, 2004; Crick & Koch, 2005; Goll et al., 2015).
One of the most challenging issues to study the human claustrum is its intricated
anatomical location and its irregular form. Technical constrains have limited the detailed study of
the claustrum. We propose overcome these challenge by assessing the whole brain resting state
functional connectivity of the claustrum using the high-resolution WU-Minn Human Connectome
Project (HCP) dataset, which, differs qualitatively from the standard neuroimgen data, due to its
higher spatial and temporal resolution and differing distortion. The functional datasets were
acquired with a spatial resolution of 2 mm isotropic and a temporal resolution of 0.7 s at 3T,
which in a non usual high spatial or temporal resolution for whole brain coverage. (HCP; Van
Essen et al., 2012; Van Essen et al., 2013; Glasser et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013)

Materials and methods
Subjects
The study included data from 40 healthy young adults (20 females) with ages between 22 and 35
years old. Subjects were selected from the public WU-Minn Human Connectome Project (HCP
NIH Blueprint: The Human Connectome Project) (Van Essen et al., 2012). HCP excluded
subjects having history of psychiatric, neurological or neurodevelopmental disorder or substance
abuse. A full and detailed description of the recruitment criteria is provided by Van Essen et al.,
(2013). Our selection was restricted to subjects with complete resting-state functional magnetic
resonance imaging (rfMRI) and anatomical MRI datasets. The full informed consent from all
participants was obtained by the WU-Minn HCP Consortium. The protocols of the data

acquisition and distribution of the dataset complied with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical
Association (Van Essen et al., 2013).

Image acquisitions and preprocessing
The HCP acquired anatomical and resting-state functional MRI data at Washington University
using a customized Siemens 3T ‚ÄúConnectome Skyra‚Äù with a standard 32-channel head coil.
Structural dataset acquisitions included high resolution T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted
(T2w) images with 0.7 mm isotropic resolution, FOV = 224x224 mm, matrix = 320, 256 sagittal
slices in a single slab TR = 2400 ms, TE = 2.14 ms, TI = 1000 ms, FA = 8¬∞. Resting-state fMRI
were acquired at 2 mm isotropic resolution, TR=720ms, TE = 33.1 ms, slice thickness of 2.0 mm,
72 slices. Uƒüurbil et al., (2013) and Glasser et al., (2013) provide a full and detailed description
of the HCP acquisition protocols. We include in our study the HCP dataset preprocessed by the
HCP which due its higher spatial and temporal resolutions and differing distortions must be
processed differently from standard neuroimaging data in order to achieve optimal results.
(Glasser et al., 2013; Ugurbil et al., 2013). Pipelines developed by HCP include spatial distortion
correction, motion correction, spatial registration and normalization to MNI coordinates,
highpass filtering (cutoff=2,000s) and denoising of rfMRI. In addition, we use as confound
regressors the motion outlier volumes during the analysis, and we spatially smoothed the rfMRI
data to 3 mm full width half max (FWHM = 3) using conn toolbox (V18b, Functional
connectivity toolbox, NITRC) (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Casta√±√≥n, 2012), and SPM 12
software (Friston et al., 1994).

Mask of claustrum and functional connectivity

The T1 anatomical volumes were used to manually delineate right and left claustrum masks for
each subject, in an axial plane, in a superior-to-inferior manner to identify the body of the
claustrum and edited in the coronal and sagittal plane for accuracy. We transformed them into the
rfMRI space, spatially averaged the claustrum masks and established the threshold the mask to
transform it into a binary mask. All these processes were carried on with FSL tools v5.0. The
claustrum mask constituted our seed to perform a seed-based functional connectivity analysis.
High resolution functional connectivity maps were estimated using the Conn toolbox
(V18b, Functional connectivity toolbox, NITRC), (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Casta√±√≥n,
2012). Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated within each subject in MNI space taking
the seed time course and the time course of all other voxels. The resultant correlation coefficient
maps were converted to normally distributed scores using Fisher transform to permit a secondlevel analysis, in which, a one-sample t-test was performed. The resultant connectivity maps were
corrected at map level p<0.05 using False Discovery Rate (FDR).

Results
The claustrum was delimited by our averaged mask whose dimensions are 31mm x 1 mm
x 17 mm. We closely coincide with the dimension described by Kapakin (2011); figure 2 shows
on an axial view the average mask used in the analysis.
We identified functional connectivity of the left claustrum (p<0.05 p-FDR corrected) with
precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, insular cortex, superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus,
opercular cortex, frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (Fig. 3). We found functional
connectivity between the right calustrum and precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, insular cortex,
temporal cortex supramarginal gyrus, opercular cortex, frontal cortex, cingulate gyrus and
occipital cortex (Fig. 4).

We performed a ROI-to-ROI (region of interest) analysis using as region of interest the
claustrum and the CONN atlas cortical ROIs (Harvard-Oxford and the CONN network cortical
ROIs (HCP-ICA). We obtained a positive correlation between the left claustrum and subcortical
areas such as caudate nucleus, putamen, accumbens, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and
brainstem. In same way when using the right claustrum as ROI we obtained positive functional
connectivity with caudate nuecleus, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and brainstem,
but not accumbens nucleus as in left claustrum. (p<0.05 p-FDR corrected) (Fig. 5).
Finally, functional connectivity was also found with network cortical ROIs. The claustra are
functionally connected with nodes of the default mode network such as medial prefrontal cortex,
lateral parietal cortex, salience network, including anterior insula, rostral prefrontal cortex,
anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus, language network whose areas are the inferior
frontal gyrus, posterior superior temporal gyrus, frontoparietal network including the lateral
prefrontal cortex, areas of the dorsal attention network, such frontal eye field, the intraparietal
sulcus. The superior and lateral areas pertaining to the sensoriomotor network, the cereberal
anterior area, and visual areas such as medial, lateral and occipital visual area (Fig. 6).

Discussion
The claustrum is located deep within the insular cortex, and investigating its function and
connections is difficult due to its size and shape. Despite the inherent difficulty, it has been
investigated using animal models (rodent, cat and non-human primate) and invasive techniques
such as retrograde neuronal tract tracer labeling (Mathur et al., 2009) and electrophysiological
studies (Remedios et al., 2014). In a recent review, Goll et al. (2015) presented the anatomical

connectivity of the claustrum in the rodent brain; the primary inputs and outputs to the claustrum
are from the cerebral cortex, ‚Äì which are reciprocal connections ‚Äì such as prefrontal cortex,
motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, auditory cortex and visual cortex. The claustrum also
maintains connections with the striatum, amygdala, cingulate area, prelimbic area and
hippocampus. The study of structural connections in human claustrum has advanced with the use
of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and the results are consistent with those in animal models, i.
e. frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital areas (Fern√°ndez-Miranda et al., 2008; Milardi et al.,
2015; Torgerson and Van Horn, 2014).
One of the most important hypotheses regarding the function of the claustrum was
proposed by Crick and Koch (2005), who proposed the claustrum as an important hub which
integrates stimuli from different sensory modalities. Hadjikhani et al., (1998) researching neural
bases of tactile‚Äìvisual cross-modal transfer of shape in humans using neuroimaging, found that
the claustrum has an important role in cross-modal matching. Their results suggest that the crossmodal adaptation is associated with multimodal converging brain areas such as anterior cingulate
cortex, inferior parietal lobe, superior and mid temporal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
insular cortex. Banati et al., (2000) also found activation by tactile-visual stimuli in anterior
cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, mid and superior temporal cortex and insula
cortex. These results are consistent with our findings that anterior cingulate cortex, superior,
temporal cortex and insular cortex are functionally connecting with the claustrum.
On the other hand, another important hypothesis about the function of the claustrum is
related to segregation of attention (Goll et al., 2015). The claustrum is considered as a hub for
attention, according to this model, the prefrontal cortex modules to the claustrum in a top down
process and the output of the claustrum modules the cortical representation of the sensory
modalities. The claustrum controls which cortical output will be attended amplifying the

preferred modality and reducing the other ones. This process would be modulated by additional
subcortical inputs related to the context and emotion hippocampus and amygdala respectively.
Our results are compatible with this model, since we found a positive correlation between the
claustrum and the prefrontal cortex, anterior cortex cingulate, pre y postcentral gyrus, amygdala
and hippocampus, which, according to the model of Goll et al. are implied in the segregation of
attention (Goll et al., 2015).
We found functional connectivity with specific nodes of the characterized networks such
as salience, default mode, dorsal attention, frontoparietal, language, sensoriomotor, visual an
cerebelar anterior, which imply that the claustrum is not only well connected structurally but also
functionally.

Our findings reveal that the claustrum maintains a functional connectivity with regions of the
salience network, this could be justified not only due to the anatomical closeness of the claustrum
with the insula, but also because they share ontogeny. Pirone et al., (2012) using
immunohistochemistry technique and samples of insular and temporal subunits of the human
claustrum, revelead that the claustrum share ontogeny with the insular cortex, but not with the
putamen. Additionally, Remedios et al., 2014, analized the neurons located in the auditory zone
of the primate claustrum and arrived to the conclusion that the clausturm detects the occurrence
of novel or salient stimulus.
On the other hand, we found functional connectivity between the claustrum and executive
networks brain, which evidence that the claustrum participate in cognition. Claustral activation is
reported in a fMRI study about the neuronal bases of the integration of auditory and visual
stimuli, which, were conceptually related (congruent). The author of this study concluded that the

contribution of the claustrum was related to the congruence of stimuli, not only to the matching
of these (Naghavi et al., 2007).

We are confident that our study contribute to the understanding of this thin but well
connected structure: the claustrum. The use of the high quality HCP dataset provide us of
advantages to our study, because of its high spatial and temporal resolution; and to the
standardized preprocessing accomplished by the HCP members. Additionally the age range
chosen (22-35 years-old) permit an unbiased analyses due to it represent healthy adults who are
not experimenting the major neurodevelopmental changes nor neurodegenerative changes (Essen
et al., 2012).

In conclusion, the claustrum is a highly connected brain structure, hardly to study due its
anatomical location and irregular form. Neuroimaging offers a powerful tool to explore its
function non invasively, despite its limited resolution. Making use of open access high resolution
datasets, we have characterized the functional connectivity of the human claustrum, which
mainly include positive relations with insular, frontal, temporal and cingulate cortex. These
findings evidence the close relationship of the claustrum with the salience network, strongly
supporting its proposed role to mediate the salience value of sensory stimuli.
