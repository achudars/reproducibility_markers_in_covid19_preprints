Running head: MDR colonization dynamics

40-word summary of the article’s main point
While 14 of 20 Europeans carried multidrug-resistant bacteria at the end of their 3-week visit
to Laos, whole-genome sequencing of daily stool samples revealed acquisition by all,
involving multiple transient acquisitions with a potential for longer MDR-GN colonization.

Abstract

Background
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is highly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.
International travel contributes substantially to the global spread of intestinal multidrugresistant gram-negative (MDR-GN) bacteria. Of the 100 million annual visitors to tropical
countries, 30–70% become colonized by MDR-GN bacteria. The phenomenon has been well
documented, but since sampling has only been conducted after travelers’ return home, data
on the actual colonization process are scarce.

Methods
A group of 20 European volunteers visiting Lao People’s Democratic Republic for three weeks
provided daily stool samples and filled in daily questionnaires. Acquisition of extendedspectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (ESBL-GN) was examined by
selective stool cultures followed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates.

Results
While colonization rates were 70% at the end of the study, daily sampling revealed that all
participants had acquired ESBL-GN at some time point during their overseas stay, the status
varying day by day. WGS analysis ascribed the transient pattern of colonization to sequential
acquisition of new strains, resulting in a loss of detectable colonization by the initial MDR-GN
strains. All but one participant acquired multiple strains (2–5). Of the total of 83 unique strains
identified (53 E. coli, 10 Klebsiella, 20 other ESBL-GN species), some were shared by as many
as four subjects.

This is the first study to characterize in real time the dynamics of acquiring MDR-GN during
travel. Our data show multiple transient colonization events indicative of constant microbial
competition.

Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a serious threat to human health worldwide [1]. The
rapid global spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) clones of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae raises an alarming public health concern [1].
Worldwide dissemination of successful clones such as E. coli ST131 has been the primary
driver in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli (ESBL-Ec) becoming
prevalent among clinical isolates [2,3]. Correspondingly, the global spread of carbapenemaseproducing clones of E. coli such as ST410 [4] and ST167 [5], and K. pneumoniae clones such as
CG258 and ST11 [6,7] largely accounts for the rapid emergence of carbapenem resistance in
clinical isolates of gram-negative pathogens worldwide.

The literature shows international travel to be strongly associated with acquisition of MDRGN strains, mostly ESBL-Ec [8–15]. The carriage rate of intestinal MDR-GN bacteria is highest
among inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, followed by Africa and
South America [16]. Not surprisingly, travelers visiting these high-risk regions are at
substantial risk of acquiring MDR-GN bacteria [15]. Colonization occurs even during short
visits [8–15] and without antimicrobial use [17] and can last for months or even over a year
[8,12,13] and lead to further spread after return home [8,13]. Genome-level analysis of MDR
strains colonizing travelers shows that newly acquired MDR strains tend to displace resident
intestinal commensal E. coli strains alongside new non-MDR strains, such that the pre-travel
population remains as a minority [18].

In previous studies of travelers’ intestinal colonization by MDR-GN bacteria, samples have
been taken immediately prior to travel and upon return to home country [8–14] . As such the

dynamics of this competitive colonization process are unknown. Here we present a
longitudinal study carried out with volunteers visiting the Lao People’s Democratic Republic
(Laos). Combining daily samples from these travelers during their stay and fine-scale genomic
analysis enabled us to demonstrate that colonization by MDR-GN bacteria is a highly dynamic
process. We detected constant switching between the circulating MDR-GN stains acquired by
individual hosts. Our finding of identical strains colonizing multiple individuals suggests
common sources of acquisition or transmission between travelers. We also show colonization
by strains with an alarming prevalence of mcr colistin resistance genes which belong to
lineages not previously reported as high-risk AMR clones.

Methods
Study design
We characterised the colonization process by ESBL-GN through sampling stools on arrival,
each day abroad, and at departure. The specimens were examined for presumptive ESBL-GN
by culture, and the isolates were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing. The study protocol
was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Helsinki University Hospital and the
Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz. All subjects provided written informed
consent.

Volunteers, samples, and travel destination
Volunteers were recruited prospectively among participants at a medical course held 19
September – 9 October, 2015 in Vientiane, Laos. We also invited the recruitees’ companions
to volunteer. While staying there, each volunteer was asked to provide daily stool samples.
Those collected within the first two days were considered as baseline samples and the final

stools as departure samples. Questionnaires assessing background information and travelrelated data were used at recruitment and before departure. During the stay, the volunteers
were asked to complete a health card to record gastrointestinal symptoms, food habits, and
medication use each day. Travelers’ diarrhea (TD) was defined as passage of ≥ 3 loose or liquid
stools per day. Any ESBL-GN not found in the baseline samples but detected in one or more
stool samples taken later were defined as travel-acquired ESBL-GN. Only volunteers providing
at least five daily samples were included in the final subject group (Figure 1).

Stool cultures and phenotypic susceptibility testing
The initial screening for presumptive ESBL-GN strains from stool samples was conducted in
Vientiane at the Microbiology Laboratory of Mahosot Hospital by culture on CHROMagarä
ESBL agar plates (CHROMagar, Paris France). Representative blue and pink colonies were
subcultured and stored at -80oC in ‘Protect ‘tubes (Technical Service Consultants Ltd,
Heywood, UK) along with the original swabs. The samples were then transported by plane on
dry ice first to the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel, and then to the
University of Helsinki (Finland) for analyses. In Finland, the bacteria were re-cultured on
ChromID ESBL agar plates (BioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) and a representative colony of
all morphotypes present on the ChromID plate was subcultured and cryopreserved in
Microbank beads. The isolates were shipped on dry ice to the University of Birmingham for
genome sequencing by the MicrobesNG facility (http://microbesng.uk). Libraries were
prepared using the Nextera XT kit, and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform over 250
cycles.

Illumina genome sequence reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (V 0.3) [19] with a sliding
window quality of Q15. De novo assembled genomes were produced using SPAdes (V 3.13.0)
[20]. Resulting assembled genomes were annotated using Prokka (V 1.11) [21]. Antibiotic

Results
Description of participants, travel, and symptoms during stay
A total of 23 volunteers were recruited, three of whom had to be later excluded for having
only provided two samples (of note, ESBL-GN was found in them all). The final study
population thus comprised 20 European volunteers (for demographics, see Table 1). Of the
volunteers, 50% were aged < 50 years, 55% were female, 19 of them MDs participating at a
medical course. The median age was 42.5 years (IQR 33.5−57.0), and the median duration of
stay in Laos was 20 (IQR 12−21) days. Five participants (25%) had used antimicrobial
medication during the previous year, three (15.0%) arrived directly from another tropical

region, one (5%) had visited the tropics within the past three months and seven (35%) within
the last year (Table 1). The group provided a total of 236 stool samples.

Over the sampling period, the volunteers stayed at three separate hotels, lunched and dined
at various restaurants either in small groups or all together, and participated in daily rounds
at local hospitals. On the first or second weekend, most volunteers visited the cities of Luang
Prabang or Vang Vieng. Four of the twenty contracted TD, and one took antibiotics.

All participants were colonized by ESBL-GN, dominated by E. coli
ESBL-GN strains were detected in the baseline samples of seven of the twenty volunteers,
including three who had arrived directly from another Asian destination. All volunteers
provided at least one stool sample positive for ESBL-GN in culture by day 10 of their visit (Fig
2). Of the 236 fecal samples collected, 174 (73.7%) contained detectable ESBL-GN, yielding a
total of 306 isolates. E. coli was the most abundant species isolated, accounting for 219 of the
306 isolates, followed by Citrobacter spp. (28 isolates), Klebsiella spp. (16), Acinetobacter spp.
(12), Enterobacter cloacae (11), and a number of other low-prevalence species including
Aeromonas spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Table S1). When allocating individual
isolates to the participants, colonization by any given ESBL-GN during the study period was
clearly transient in nature, with isolates detected in only one or a few samples obtained from
any given individual, sometimes with days between isolation.

Genomic analyses of isolates identified competition for colonization both at strain and
species level

The genomes of all 306 isolates were found to contain at least one antimicrobial resistance
gene. The most prevalent ESBL gene type was blaCTX-M, found in a total of 226 isolates (74%),
with CTX-M-55 (n=64), CTX-M-14 (n=58), CTX-M-159 (n=57), CTX-M-15 (n=30), and CTX-M102 (n=25) as the most common types (Table S2). Some isolates contained multiple CTX-M
types. Mobile colistin resistance genes (mcr) were found in 82 isolates (28%), all but two of
which were E. coli (one Aeromonas sp., the other K. pneumoniae). Superimposing MLST
designation (Figure 2, Figure S1) and bla/mcr gene type (Figure 3) onto each individual
traveler’s isolates provided further insight into the transient nature of gut colonization. Whilst
participant 11 was found to have contracted solely an ST2067 E. coli carrying blaCTX-M-15, the
others were colonized by multiple STs of E. coli and co-colonized by other ESBL-GN species.
For example, participant 34, who took azithromycin for TD on 21–23 September, was
transiently colonized by five different E. coli strains over the study period, each with different
bla gene repertoires. Participant 16 showed a regular flux between isolation of an ST38, ST93,
and ST101 strain, whilst participant 40 had initial colonization by an ST48 strain later displaced
by an ST38. All these strains have unique signatures of carriage of multiple bla genes,
indicating that travelers are exposed to a large number of MDR-GN bacteria and MDRconferring genes during the initial colonization process.

Uncommon population structure of ESBL-GN isolates
We analyzed the population of E. coli isolates at MLST designation level (Figure 4). The most
common E. coli sequence types identified were ST101, ST34, ST38, and ST195. These lineages
are very uncommon in surveys of ESBL and carbapenem-resistant E. coli, both in Europe [3]
and indeed in previous human isolates from Laos [22,23]. Superimposing the presence of
specific ESBL-Ec and mcr genes onto a phylogenetic tree of the E. coli isolates revealed blaCTX10

M

genes to be ubiquitous throughout the sampled population of isolates, with mcr genes also

widely distributed across the population (Figure S2). Analysis of the K. pneumoniae lineages
showed isolates belonging predominantly to ST2176 and ST37, none of which are well
characterized globally disseminated clones [6,24].

Fine-scale genomic analysis identified common strains infecting participants
When analyzing the population structure of the E. coli isolates, very little diversity was found
in strains within each of the different lineages. To investigate relationships between isolates
within the lineages, we carried out a high-resolution SNP analysis using the first isolated strain
as a reference. Our data showed a number of common strains colonizing participants, often
with zero SNPs’ difference between them (Figure 5). An identical ST515 strain colonized
participants 6, 17, 33, and 5, whilst an identical ST38 colonized participants 5, 40, and 13.
Participants 19 and 34 shared an identical ST34 strain, whilst participants 6 and 21 shared an
identical ST385 strain. Participant 11 was colonized on day 8 by an ST2067 also isolated from
a sample from the travel companion of this participant the following day. With only one
exception, those belonging to each of these clusters stayed at the same hotel and, according
to the researchers’ observations, tended to spend a lot of time together.

Discussion
The impact of travel on the global spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli is well documented. Of
travelers returning from the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, Africa or South Asia, 2080% are colonized by MDR-GN bacteria, most commonly ESBL-Ec [8–15]. This colonization can
extend over a period of months or even over a year [8,12,13]. Whilst the phenomenon is well
described, the dynamics of the colonization process and the competition involved have not

been thoroughly characterized. Thus far, traveler studies have analyzed pre- and post-travel
samples [8–14], whereas the actual travel period has not been accurately covered.

Here we monitored 20 European visitors to Laos on a daily basis over a three-week stay.
Combining their personal data with fine-scale genomic analysis of the strains isolated from
fecal samples, we demonstrated that establishing colonization by an ESBL-GN strain during
travel to endemic regions is an extremely dynamic process. We identified a constant influx of
newly acquired ESBL-GN strains in all but one of the twenty participants. Over the duration
of their visits, the volunteers were colonized by up to five different strains, and often acquired
multiple ESBL-GN species. Few traveler studies have employed genome-level analyses [18],
but several have reported isolating more than one new colonizing ESBL-GN strain from posttravel samples [10–14]. Our data reveal the true scale and complexity at which drug-resistant
bacteria colonize the intestinal tract during travel, demonstrating that it has been seriously
underestimated. In addition, our data clearly show that several of our participants lost some
of their travel-acquired ESBL-GN strains while still abroad. This indicates that previous studies
solely employing pre- and post-travel sampling have under-reported the actual extent to
which travelers are colonized by ESBL-GN. There is a potential caveat to our study in that the
apparent cyclic disappearance and re-appearance of strains may be related to the sensitivity
of the culture methods used, and colonizing strains may occasionally have been missed when
picking colonies for sequencing.

Our fine-scale genomic analysis enabled identification of a number of strains shared by our
volunteers. Some of the strains colonized up to four participants, often with zero SNPs’
difference across the entire genome, and with a maximum of five SNPs’ difference between

shared strains. Participants sharing strains stayed at the same hotels and spent time in each
other’s company. In one exceptional instance, two participants, X and Y (participant
designations; X an author of this paper) staying in separate accommodations were found to
share an identical strain (Figure 5). These two participants had a point of contact, X taking a
shower in Y’s bathroom. Whilst direct transmission cannot be confirmed, the clonality of the
isolates suggests that the two colonization events did not result from exposure to a common
environmental reservoir. Such reservoirs are generally colonized by bacteria for extended
periods of time, which leads to extensive diversity within the bacterial population [25,26].
Thus, direct transmission or acquisition through common exposure such as consumption of
food or water appears the most likely explanation.

The population of ESBL-Ec isolates in this study has an unexpected composition.
Epidemiological surveys of multidrug-resistant E. coli, especially those focusing on ESBL
strains, are dominated by E. coli ST131 [27]. Epidemiological investigations carried out on E.
coli in Laos have also shown ST131 to be the dominant drug-resistant lineage in the country
[22,23]. However, we isolated no ST131 strains, and ST38 was the only lineage in our study
that has been reported in studies previously conducted in Laos. They had investigated both
intestinal colonization isolates [23] and clinical blood stream isolates [22], suggesting that the
ESBL-Ec population in Laos may be particularly dynamic and prone to frequent fluctuation.
Interestingly, ST101, ST34, and ST195, and other lineages frequently isolated in our study
have never been reported as clinical ESBL-Ec isolates in countries such as the United Kingdom
where high-quality longitudinal data are available [3]. Some reports describe ESBL-Ec ST101
[28], but none report ST34 or ST195. E. coli ST38 has been extensively reported as an ESBLEc strain isolated both from humans and animals [29–31].

Most previous studies among travelers have only described acquisition of ESBL-E. coli. A few
have reported multiple findings of ESBL-DEC (diarrheagenic E. coli) [32] or single findings of
ESBL-Klebsiella [11,14] or carbapenemase-producing E. coli [12,13]. Our data show, in
addition to ESBL- E. coli (219 of 306 strains, 72%) a substantial number of ESBL-producing nonE. coli Gram-negative bacteria, such as Citrobacter (9%), Klebsiella (5%), Acinetobacter (4%),
and Enterobacter cloacae (4%) and even low numbers of Aeromonas spp. and
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This finding may be ascribed to an especially high rate of
exposure to a variety of MDR-GN bacteria, since 19 of our volunteers attended a course of
tropical medicine which included daily clinical rounds at local hospitals. High MDR-GN
colonization rates have been reported among travelers hospitalized in the tropics [33].
The complete absence of carbapenemase-producing E. coli in these samples is also
noteworthy. We screened for ESBL-producing strains, but carbapenemase producers would
also have grown on the selective plates used. However, WGS analysis showed a complete
absence of carbapenemase genes, a finding somewhat surprising in Southeast Asia where the
prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is increasing [34]. Such isolates have
only recently been reported in Laos [35], suggesting that carbapenem resistance has not yet
become a major problem in the country. Even more striking were the extremely high levels
of the mobile colistin resistance gene mcr in our E. coli isolates. The ST101 lineage which
dominated our isolate collection has been identified as a driving lineage in the emergence of
ESBL-Ec, and mcr positive E. coli in the region [36], but we observed the mcr gene across a
large number of lineages, a finding which may be of substantial importance. This confirms
earlier reports showing that travel exacerbates the global spread of not only ESBL genes but
also E. coli strains carrying mobile colistin resistance genes [37].

By combining real-time sampling of travelers with genome-level analyses, we have
demonstrated that colonization by ESBL-GN during travel is an extremely dynamic process
characterized by competition between resistant strains and an individual’s own microbiota.
We have also shown that prevalent strains can colonize multiple travelers via shared routes
such as transmission or acquisition from a common source. The challenge now lies in
unraveling the mechanisms that underlie this process and competition between the clones,
as well as finding tools to prevent colonization already at its initial stages.

Figure 1. Overview of sampling and analysis workflow with inclusion criteria.
This study recruited 23 participants who provided daily stool samples. These samples were
screened for gram-negative extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative
(ESBL-GN) bacteria. Participants who produced less than four stool samples (due to
constipation, for example) were excluded from the final study. Following selective culture,
isolates were whole-genome sequenced and analysed to determine sequence type,
resistance profiles, and genomic homology.

Figure 2. Colonization of participants by ESBL-producing gram-negative (ESBL-GN) over a 21day period in Lao PDR.
Patterns of colonization vary dramatically between participants. Some harbored a single
dominant strain, whilst more transient and frequent strains were detected in the stool
samples of others. Some participants appeared to have carried a considerably higher load of
ESBL bacteria (e.g. 21, 34), while others only had one or two samples with ESBL isolates
(e.g.18, 26). Solid lines represent uninterrupted and concurrent colonization by a single strain.
Dashed lines represent maintenance of a single strain over multiple days interrupted by
colonization by another strain of the same species or a period of no growth. Strains are shown
by participant, with a maximum of five differing strains identified from the samples of a single
individual. Due to the large number of constituent strains in the database, the color
designations do not represent the same strains across multiple volunteers.

Figure 3. Resistance determinants identified in ESBL-GN isolates over a 21-day period in Lao
PDR.
We detected a highly diverse and abundant set of resistance determinants with numerous
CTX-M variants, and a surprising abundance of MCR (28% carriage rate). We also found less
common ESBL types, such as CMY, VEB, and CFE. Frequent patterns of resistance genes cooccurred in the same patient, overlapping with instances where a single colonizing strain was
identified (detailed in Figure 2). Some of these also extended to other participants, (further
characterized in Figure 5). Beta-lactamase genes are encoded using symbols, MCR = square,
CMY = triangle, TEM = diamond, OXA = pentagon, SED = star, ACT = hexagon, VEB = inverted
triangle, CFE = kite. CTX-M enzymes are encoded in colored circles, with CTX-M subtype
encoded by different hues. CTX-M-14 = red, 15 = dark orange, 40 = pale orange, 55 = yellow,
65 = teal, and 102 = navy.

Figure 4. Abundance of unique sequence types amongst the traveler cohort over the 21-day
study period.
Isolates were examined using a high-resolution SNP analysis. Strains exhibiting genetic
heterogeneity were considered unique, and their sequence type was recorded. ST-101 was
the most abundant sequence type observed.

Figure 5. Linkage of isolates between participants.
High resolution SNP analysis identified several instances of a single strain colonizing multiple
participants. These strains differed by ≥5 SNPs, with the most prolifically shared strain (ST515) found in participants 06, 17 and 33. Solid lines represent isolates that were identical (i.e.
