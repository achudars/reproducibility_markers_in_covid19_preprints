Abstract
A synthetic lethal effect arises when a cancer-associated change introduces a
unique vulnerability to cancer cells that makes them unusually susceptible to a drug’s
inhibitory activity. The synthetic lethal approach is attractive because it enables
targeting of cancers harboring specific genomic alterations, the products of which may
have proven refractory to direct targeting. An example is cancer driven by
overexpression of MYC. Here, we conducted a high-content screen for compounds that
are synthetic lethal to elevated MYC using a small-molecule library to identify
compounds that are closely related to, or are themselves, regulatory-approved drugs.
The screen identified dimethylfasudil, a potent and reversible inhibitor of Rhoassociated kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2. Close analogs of dimethylfasudil are used
clinically to treat neurologic and cardiovascular disorders. The synthetic lethal
interaction was conserved in rodent and human cell lines and could be observed with
activation of either MYC or its paralog MYCN. The synthetic lethality seems specific to
MYC overexpressing cells as it could not be substituted by a variety of oncogenic
manipulations and synthetic lethality was diminished by RNAi-mediated depletion of
MYC in human cancer cell lines. Collectively, these data support investigation of the use
of dimethylfasudil as a drug that is synthetic lethal for malignancies that specifically
overexpress MYC.

Significance Statement
Synthetic lethal targeting of tumors overexpressing MYC holds promise for
attacking aggressive malignancies. Here we describe a synthetic lethal interaction

between dimethylfasudil and overexpression of MYC. Uniquely, this novel synthetic
lethal interaction points toward an opportunity for synthetic lethality with a molecule
likely to harbor favorable drug-like properties that enable systemic use.

Introduction
At least one of the proteins encoded by MYC, MYCN and L-MYC, paralogous
members of the MYC family, are deregulated in over 50% of human cancers. This can
be due to mutation, translocation, amplification, or alterations in upstream regulators [13]. Overexpression of MYC is directly transforming [4] and several studies have shown
that diminishing MYC in vivo can elicit tumor regression, suggesting that direct
therapeutic targeting of MYC will be a way to attack human malignancies [5-7].
Major challenges exist to developing a drug that directly inhibits MYC. As a
transcription factor, MYC functions in the nucleus. Any drug that inhibits MYC may have
to gain access to the nuclear compartment, something currently only feasible for small
molecule drugs. However, unlike kinases, MYC lacks a specific active site for such a
small molecule inhibitor to interact. In addition, tumor cell heterogeneity can contribute
to the emergence of clones that have acquired additional mutations that allow MYCindependent growth [8]. This means that not all cancer cells with abundant MYC will be
absolutely dependent on MYC for proliferation and survival.
One strategy that might overcome all these obstacles is to exploit cellular
dependencies uniquely induced by MYC in cancer cells. Such synthetic lethality
between overexpression of MYC and targeting of other cellular pathways and proteins
has been described with the activation of the DR5 death receptor pathway [9], depletion

of the non-essential amino acid glutamine [10], depletion of the core spliceosome
component, BUD31 [11], depletion of AMPK-related kinase 5 [12] and pharmacological
inhibition of CDK1 [13], PIM1 [14] and Aurora kinase B (AURKB) [15]. Unfortunately, the
clinical potential for AURKB inhibitors has been hampered by patient toxicity. This may
also limit other synthetic lethal approaches that have not yet advanced to the clinic.
To bypass this possibility, we conducted a phenotypical screen using a smallmolecule library of already clinically used drugs and their close analogs for the ability to
elicit cell-division defects specifically in MYC overexpressing cells. The high-content
screen positively identified a ROCK kinase inhibitor dimethylfasudil (diMF), but not its
analogs fasudil and ripasudil. These analogs are themselves ROCK inhibitors so
synthetic lethality is likely mediated by an as yet to be defined target unique to diMF.
We utilized both model cell lines and human cancer cell lines to confirm the MYC-diMF
synthetic lethal interaction. It was conserved in rodent and human cells and was, in all
cases, associated with induction of classical apoptotic features and accumulation of
polyploid cells.
Fasudil and ripasudil are both used clinically, with fasudil being used as a
systemic treatment. It is likely that diMF may also possess drug-like properties such as
a favorable pharmacokinetic and adverse event profile that would enable clinical use.
Our findings suggest a new avenue for developing a potent and non-toxic therapeutic
intervention for MYC overexpressing tumors using diMF.

Human cancer cell lines that were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) include Hela (ATCC® CCL-2™), NCI-H841 (ATCC® CRL-5845™),
DU-145 (ATCC® HTB-81™) and Calu-6 (ATCC® HTB-56™). Cells were grown for three
passages and frozen as cell stock. Prior to each experiment, a stock vial was thawed
and serially passaged for no more than five generations. As previously described [13],
RPE-NEO and RPE-MYC cells were generated by transfecting hTERT-immortalized
human primary retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE-hTERT) with a vector expressing
the Neomycin resistance gene (Neo) alone or alongside the MYC oncogene,
respectively, followed by selection with 800 µg/ml G418/Geneticin. RPE-MYC cells were
transfected with a construct harboring an H2B-GFP fusion gene and selected with 1
µg/ml of Puromycin to generate RPE-MYCH2B-GFP cells for high-content screening. The
mammalian H2B-GFP expression construct was a gift from Dr. Andrei Goga of
University of California, San Francisco. Construction of derivatives of Rat1A cells and
verification of ectopic expression of oncogenic proteins has been described [13, 16].
Briefly, Rat1A cells were infected with retrovirus expressing a variety of cancer genes.
Transduction efficiency was judged using GFP expression. Rat1A/MycNER, IMR90/MycER, HA1E/MycER, and HA1E/MycNER were generated by infection of parental
cells with viral particles produced using Phoenix packaging cells (ATCC® CRL-3213™)
followed by Puromycin selection (1 μg/ml) [10, 17]. All mammalian cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 5% CO2 in a
humidified incubator. To ensure that cell lines were free of mycoplasma contamination,
a Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit (ATCC® 30-1012K™) was used to assay for the
mycoplasma 16S rRNA-coding region after experimentation.

Cell viability assays
Cell viability was determined by the Trypan blue exclusion assay, as previously
described [15], or alternatively through immunofluorescent staining for various apoptotic
markers. Viability was expressed as the percentage of dead cells in the population at an
indicated time-point following initiation of drug treatment. For each assay, data is
presented from three independent experiments that were performed with sequentially
passaged cells, and each experiment was done in triplicate (n=9).

Small molecules
The FDA-approved drug panel of 2576 drugs (Cat. # L1300) was purchased from
Selleck Chemicals. An additional two hundred analogs of various FDA-approved drugs
were synthesized in-house and were included in our high-content screening panel. The
following small molecules were from commercial sources and used at the final
concentrations indicated in the figures or their legends: VX-680 (Cat. # S1048) was
purchased from Selleck Chemicals; paclitaxel (Cat. # P-9600), etoposide (Cat. # E4488), staurosporine (Cat. # S-9300), and doxorubicin (Cat. # D-4000) were obtained
from LC Laboratories; nocodazole (Cat. # M1404), cycloheximide (Cat. # C-7698),
cisplatin (Cat. # C2210000), and monastrol (Cat. # M8515) were from Sigma-Aldrich;
Zeocin (Cat. # R25001), G418/Geneticin (Cat. # 10131035), 0.4% trypan blue solution
(Cat. # 15250061), and puromycin dihydrochloride (Cat. # A1113802) were purchased
from Thermo-Fisher Scientific; Eg5 inhibitor II (Cat. # BP-30219) was obtained from
BroadPharm; diMF (Cat. # sc-203592) and dihydrocytochalasin B (DCB) (Cat. # sc202579) were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

High-content drug screening for MYC-synthetic lethal agents
RPE-MYCH2B-GFP cells were cultured in 150 mm petri dishes and were cryopreserved in large amounts before use. Cells with the same passage number were
thawed and seeded to batches of 96-well microtiter plates with 2,000 cells per well as
the starting cell number for high-content screening. Treatment with small molecules was
initiated 24 hours after seeding at a final concentration of 10 μM in 0.1% DMSO. Cells
were imaged 24 and 48 hours after initiation of drug treatment to monitor H2B-GFPlabelled DNA using an IN Cell Analyzer 2000 (GE). Compounds that triggered mitotic
arrest at 24 hours and polyploidy and apoptosis at 48 hours were scored as positive and
were subjected to further validation.

RNA interference
Cells were cultured in a 6-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight before
transfection with either a negative control siRNA, or MYC siRNA at a concentration of 50
nM using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The sequences for the MYC siRNA and control siRNA were previously described [18].
The transfection efficiency was more than 95% as judged by expression of a cotransfected pEGFP-N1 construct (Clontech).

Immunofluorescent microscopy
Immunofluorescent staining experiments were performed as previously described
[15]. Cells were cultured on coverslips in a 6-well plate, fixed with either 4%

paraformaldehyde or 4% paraformaldehyde followed with methanol treatment, and then
permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. Rabbit IgG antibodies for active caspase 3 (Cat.
# 9661S), active caspase 9 (Cat. # 20750S), and cleaved PARP (Cat.# 5625S) were
from Cell Signaling Technology and used at 1:100 dilution for each. Primary antibodies
were detected with Rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG
(H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat. # 711-025-152) at 1:500 dilution.

After

immunostaining, we mounted cells on microscope slides with 4’,6’-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI)-containing Vectashield mounting solution (Vector Laboratories,
Cat. # H1500). For determination of mitochondrial membrane potential, cells were
cultured on cover slips and exposed for 30 min. at 37 °C with 40 nM Mitotracker® Red

LSM510 confocal laser microscope with a 63X/1.4 N.A. oil objective or an EVOS FL
Auto microscope (Thermo Fisher).

Western blot analysis
Whole cell extracts were prepared by treating cells for 15 min. at 4 °C with a lysis
buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCL, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM DTT,
and 0.5 mM EGTA] supplemented with BD BaculoGold Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (BD
Biosciences, Cat. # 554779). The extracts were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min. to
clear insoluble material. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined

using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Cat. # 5000006). Lysates containing 50μg of
protein were resolved on NuPAGE (4–12%) Bis-Tris gels (Thermo Fisher, Cat. #
NP0322PK2) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Cat. # 1620150).
Equal transfer of protein in each lane was assessed by staining of total protein on the
membrane with solution containing 0.1% Ponceau S (w/v) and 5.0% Acetic Acid (w/v)
(Sigma, Cat. # P7170-1L). Membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS
buffer for 1 hour before incubating overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted
1:1,000 in blocking buffer. Rabbit antibodies against MYC (Cat. # ab32072) and Actin
(Cat. # ab179467) were from Abcam and used at 1:1000 dilution. Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. #
sc-2357) were used at 1:5000 dilution. Western blots were visualized with the
SuperSignal West Femto ECL detection kit (Thermo Fisher, Cat. # 34095).

Blinding of experimental screen and statistical analysis
To reduce observer’s bias, we blinded the screening experiments presented in
Figures 1, 5 and 6. Both the experimenter and statistician were blinded when possible.
We randomized the identity of inhibitors with the RANDBETWEEN function in Excel and
relabeled chemical inhibitors accordingly. Although, chemical identity was blinded, the
identity of cell lines was not always blinded to the experimental biologists, because they
can distinguish morphological differences among different cell lines. They completed the
experiment, and collected data which was statistically analyzed. The identity of cell lines
and inhibitors was revealed after completion of statistical analysis.

Statistical analyses were performed with R software. F statistics derived from
one-way ANOVA were computed using the aov function from the stats library. The F
statistics tested the null hypothesis that all group means were equal and were
performed at 5% significance level. When null hypothesis of the F test was rejected,
Dunnett’s tests were performed to identify the group means that were statistically
different from the control group. Dunnett’s two-sided tests were computed using the
DunnettTest function from the DescTools library and were used to compare multiple
treatment groups as in Figures 1C, 3 and 5. The two-tailed, unpaired t-tests in Figures
2C, 4 and 6 were computed using the t.test function from the stats library. Each data set
represents collective data points from three independent experiments, with three
replicates in each experiment (n=9 observations/data point). Error bars represent one
standard deviation from the mean. The number of experiments and sample sizes were
determined before the collection of any data. In all figures, * indicates significance at a
1% level. The F test and Dunnett Test assume normally distributed data. We tested
normality of the data with the Shapiro-Wilk’s test and failed to reject the null hypothesis
of normality in all cases.

Results
Selection of the ROCK inhibitor diMF in a screen for synthetic lethality with MYC
MYC is known to induce potent pro-apoptotic activity but only under specific
conditions of cellular stress [1, 19, 20]. We assayed more than 2700 compounds for
activity that recapitulated the cellular contexts under which cells could not survive with
high levels of the MYC oncogene. Previously, we generated a pair of isogenic cell lines,

RPE-NEO and RPE-MYC, by engineering human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells
to ectopically express a neomycin resistance gene and the MYC oncogene,
respectively. This pair of cell lines has been used to demonstrate synthetic lethal
interactions between overexpression of MYC and inhibition of both CDK1 [13] and
AURKB [15].
Previously, synthetic lethality with the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 has been
attributed to the ability of the compound to elicit a transient mitotic arrest and then block
cytokinesis [15]. This results initially in apoptosis, but also the eventual accumulation of
polyploid cells. Our screen aimed to identify chemicals that can elicit similar cell-division
defects. To facilitate screening, a histone H2B-GFP fusion gene was stably transfected
into cells. This enabled imaging of DNA in live cells. Events were considered positive for
synthetic lethality with MYC when cell death was present in RPE-MYC cells, but absent
in RPE-NEO cells.
One compound that elicited extensive mitotic arrest at 24 hours and polyploidy at
48 hours (Fig. 1A) was identified as dimethylfasudil (diMF), (S)-(+)-2-Methyl-1-[(4methyl-5-isoquinolinyl)sulfonyl]-hexahydro-1H-1,4-diazepine

dihydrochloride,

a

competitive inhibitor of ROCK kinases (Fig. 1B). With an IC50 of 12 nM for ROCKII
inhibition, diMF is considered a potent, selective and reversible ROCK inhibitor. It has
only been used in preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies [21], perhaps due to the
plethora of alternative ROCK inhibitors that have been developed [22]. In our
confirmatory assays, diMF killed 30% of RPE-MYC cells within an initial 3-day
treatment, whereas RPE-NEO did not succumb (Fig. 1C). The solvent for diMF (DMSO)
failed to elicit cell death in either RPE-NEO or RPE-MYC cells (Fig. 1C). An important

observation from our screen is that fasudil and ripasudil, both potent ROCK inhibitors,
did not elicit cell death or polyploidy. Thus, diMF alone among the ROCK inhibitors in
the screen, could selectively kill cells that overexpress MYC.

diMF-induced death in MYC overexpressing cells is mediated by a mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway
To investigate the nature of MYC-dependent death elicited by diMF, we
examined the features of diMF-induced cell death in RPE-MYC cells. At least a portion
of the cell death phenotype was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. At 72
hours after 6 μM diMF treatment,

z-VAD-fmk at 100 μM provided more than 50%

protection against cell death (Fig. 1C). Morphologically, we observed early classical
features of apoptosis after diMF treatment such as shrinkage of the cell and
condensation and fractionation of nuclear chromatin into sharply delineated regions
(Fig. 2A). Cleaved, or activated, forms of caspases 9 (Fig. 2B, C) and 3 (Fig. 2C) and
the downstream caspase target poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) were found
after diMF treatment (Fig. 2C). These features were likely due to activation of
mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, since we also could demonstrate diMF-dependent
dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, ΔΨm, in RPE-MYC cells (Fig. 2C).
These observations support the conclusion that at least some of the MYC-dependent,
diMF-induced cell death is through a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade.

Acute activation of MYCN also confers susceptibility to the cytotoxicity of diMF

Arguably, the model RPE cell lines used in our experiments have been
propagated extensively and it is possible that sustained expression of MYC selected for
genetic or epigenetic alterations that were responsible for the observed interaction with
diMF, not MYC itself. To dispel this possibility and also to determine if another MYC
paralog could substitute for MYC in the synthetic lethality, we examined sensitivity to
diMF in cells expressing MYCER and MYCNER fusion proteins, where MYC and MYCN
are fused with the estrogen receptor. In these cells, MYC activity is acutely activated by
the addition of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OH) which induces translocation of oncogenic
MYC fusion protein to the nucleus [4]. While both 4-OH and diMF themselves resulted
in low but statistically insignificant levels of cell death, the drugs acted synergistically to
elicit approximately 30% overall lethality (Fig. 3A-D). This was true with MYCER in both
HA1E (human kidney epithelial cells) and IMR90 (human lung fibroblast) cells. It was
also apparent in MYCNER expressing Rat1a (rat embryo fibroblast) and HA1E cells. We
conclude that overexpression of either MYC or MYCN is lethal in combination with
diMF, and that the synthetic lethal relationship is conserved in rodent and human cells
and both fibroblast and epithelial cell lineages.

Depletion of MYC negates sensitivity diMF
Human cancers frequently overexpress MYC, but simultaneously may harbor
additional mutations, copy number alterations and translocations. The products of these
additional genetic events may mask the synthetic lethality we observed with model
immortalized cell lines. We assayed if human cancer-derived cells with abundant MYC
were sensitive to diMF and whether overexpression of MYC was necessary for

sensitivity. The human cancer lines Hela (cervical), Calu-6 (lung adenocarcinoma), NCIH841 (small cell lung cancer) and DU-145 (prostate) are all known to express MYC
abundantly and treatment with diMF for four days killed 25-35% of cells with all four of
these cell lines (Fig. 4A). Next, to assay if MYC was absolutely required for diMF
sensitivity, we used RNAi to deplete MYC. MYC protein levels were markedly reduced
by MYC RNAi (estimated reduction to < 20% control) (Fig. 4B). Depletion of MYC alone
elicited no appreciable levels of toxicity in any of the cell lines (Fig. 4C). RNAi depletion
of MYC did elicit a more flattened morphology, a change previously reported [18], but
cells remained viable. However, depletion of MYC with RNAi did provide each cell line
with a 50-75% protection from diMF-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 4D). These findings
indicate that abundant MYC, although dispensable for survival in the absence of diMF,
was required for cells to undergo apoptosis in response to diMF.

Alternative oncogenic events do not substitute for MYC in diMF-induced lethality
Our observation with MYC knockdown prompted us to examine more closely if
other oncogenic proteins, especially those that influence the cell cycle, might substitute
for MYC and confer synthetic lethality with diMF. We assayed the possibility using a
panel of rat embryo fibroblasts (Rat1A) that have been engineered to ectopically
express a variety of cancer genes [13]. The oncogenic proteins expressed included
oncogenic HRASG12V, myristoylated AKT1 (MyrAKT), BCL-2, ID-1, E2F1, the
intracellular domain of NOTCH1 (N1ICD), CYCLIN D1, and BCR-ABL [13]. In a blinded
assay, only MYC and the N1ICD-expressing Rat1a cells demonstrated statistically
significant cell death with 72 hours of diMF treatment (Fig. 5). We concluded that diMF

elicited synthetic lethality in combination with MYC and, with the possible exception of
the N1ICD, its role could not be substituted by the other oncoproteins assayed.
However, N1ICD-diMF lethality was only a fraction of that seen with elevated MYC and
diMF treatment and NOTCH1 is a known activator of MYC transcription [23-25]. This
regulation may not be conserved in Rat1a cells [16], so whether or not the N1ICD-diMF
interaction is a recapitulation of MYC-diMF synthetic lethality has yet to be definitively
determined.
Our findings are similar to data obtained in RPE-MYC cells with the pan-Aurora
kinase inhibitor VX-680 or an AURKB-specific inhibitor AZD1152 [15]. We recapitulated
the findings with VX-680 in the Rat1a panel (Fig. 5). Ultimately, synthetic lethality with
VX-680 has been attributed to disabling the chromosomal passenger protein complex
(CPPC) [15]. Our findings suggest that like VX-680, diMF might somehow disable
mitotic spindle assembly, the CPPC or other complexes essential to mitosis, a role not
previously ascribed to diMF.

Overexpression of MYC sensitizes cells only to selective apoptotic stimuli
We next asked whether any drug-mediated disturbance of cell division could
selectively kill cells that overexpress MYC. We utilized chemical inhibitors to explore
four additional means to disturb cell division: (1) stabilizing mitotic spindle microtubules
from disassembly with paclitaxel, (2) interfering with the polymerization of microtubules
with nocodazole, (3) targeting the centrosomal motor protein Eg5 (also known as KIF11)
with monastrol [26], and (4) interfering with assembly of the cytokinesis contractile-ring
microfilaments with dihydrocytochalasin B (DCB).

Prevention of cytokinesis with DCB mimicked the selective killing of diMF and
VX-680 specifically in RPE-MYC cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, paclitaxel and nocodazole
killed both RPE-NEO and RPE-MYC. Likewise, inhibition of the centrosomal motor
protein Eg5 with either monastrol or Eg5 inhibitor II, both of which prevent separation of
centrosomes to form the bipolar mitotic spindle [26], killed cells without discrimination.
Both the spindle toxins and Eg5 inhibitors caused prolonged arrest in mitosis prior to
apoptotic cell death. In contrast, prolonged arrest in mitosis was not associated with
treatment with diMF, DCB and VX-680. It may be that apoptosis in RPE cells following a
prolonged arrest in mitosis is not primed by overexpression of MYC, but this is
speculative.
A variety of other apoptotic stimuli failed to sensitize RPE-MYC cells to
apoptosis. For example, the deoxyribonucleotide synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea,
protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, and serum deprivation all arrested cellular
proliferation but caused no cell death in both RPE-NEO and RPE-MYC. Overexpression
of MYC sensitized cells to doxorubicin, yet cisplatin and etoposide elicited proliferative
arrest, rather than cell death, in both cell lines. Zeocin effectively kills RPE-NEO cells,
but not RPE-MYC cells.
Collectively, these data imply that overexpression of MYC does not always prime
cells to apoptosis, even with drugs that directly target the mitotic spindle or
centrosomes. Doxorubicin which intercalates with DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II
during DNA replication was preferentially lethal in RPE-MYC cells, but polyploid cells
were not induced by this drug and they were induced with diMF (Fig. 1B). Overall, the

during cytokinesis.

Discussion
MYC contributes to the genesis of many cancers and although it has been a
focus of drug research, strategies to target or exploit MYC have yet to be clinically
successful. Direct targeting of MYC with small molecule inhibitors may, in fact, be
technically impractical. Alternatively, synthetic lethal approaches provide promise to
selectively kill tumor cells that overexpress MYC while sparing normal somatic cells
[27].
One limitation with current MYC synthetic lethal compounds is toxicity. To
circumvent this, we attempted to repurpose existing small-molecule drugs. We carried
out phenotypic screening of a small molecule library for MYC-synthetic lethal agents.
The well characterized MYC synthetic lethal phenotype elicited by Aurora kinase B
inhibitors [15, 16, 28, 29] served as a measure for our screen. MYC-VX-680 synthetic
lethality, for example, induces transient mitotic arrest and apoptosis, followed by
induction of polyploidy [15]. The screen uncovered similar activity with a Rho kinase
inhibitor, diMF. Our confirmatory experiments showed that this agent selectively elicits
lethality with MYC activity. A variety of oncogenic manipulations failed to substitute for
MYC in sensitizing cells to diMF. The MYC-diMF synthetic lethality is therefore not a
consequence of cellular transformation. In addition, a variety of apoptosis-inducing
agents did not preferentially kill MYC-expressing cells, so a general priming of apoptotic

signaling by diMF was not responsible for the synthetic lethality either. Instead, diMF
likely targets a unique vulnerability induced by MYC overexpression.
ROCK 1 and ROCK 2 belong to the AGC (PKA/PKG/PKC) family of serinethreonine kinases [22]. diMF has been extensively studied as a ROCK inhibitor and
characterized in pre-clinical models. It promotes generation of pancreatic beta-like cells
from human pluripotent stem cells [30], augments neurite extension [31], enhances
proliferation and migration of endothelial progenitor cells [32], and triggers cell-cycle
arrest and cellular senescence of mouse embryo fibroblasts [33]. However, ROCKindependent activity has also been ascribed to diMF. Degradation of polyglutamineexpanded ataxin-3 and 7, causative in spinocerebellar ataxias, is induced by diMF
independent of ROCK inhibition [34]. Others have reported non-canonical targets of
diMF include LRRK2 [35] and PKA [36]. The MYC synthetic lethality observed here also
appears to be ROCK-independent. Other ROCK kinase inhibitors in the screening
library, including fasudil and ripasudil, were not identified by our screening effort and
later were confirmed negative in eliciting apoptosis and polyploidy in RPE-MYC cells
(data not shown).
One report links diMF to mitotic defect and polyploidy. Polyploidy and apoptosis
of malignant megakaryocytes can be induced by diMF and this has been ascribed to the
inhibition of AURKA [37]. In RPE-MYC cells, MYC synthetic lethality is induced by the
AURKB-specific inhibitor AZD-1152 [15]. Therefore, diMF may target multiple AURK
members or unknown CPPC components. Nonetheless, we show here that diMF only
elicits apoptosis and polyploidy in cells that overexpress MYC. Elucidating diMF targets
definitively responsible for this synthetic lethality will require further research.

Fasudil and ripasudil are used clinically and have close structural similarity to
diMF. We believe this means diMF will also have drug-like properties; the favorable
activity, pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile required for clinical applications. Our
findings raise the possibility that diMF might be repurposed for the treatment of MYC
overexpressing tumors, which are generally aggressive and may currently lack a
targeted therapy option.

control siRNA (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or MYC siRNA (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Extracts were
prepared 3 days after siRNA transfection and Western analysis used to examine levels
of MYC and β-ACTIN protein. (C) Depletion of MYC alone fails to elicit cell death. The
indicated cancer cell lines were transfected with either control siRNA or MYC siRNA.
Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay 4 days after
transfection. (D) Suppression of diMF cytoxicity by RNAi-depletion of MYC. The
indicated cancer cell lines were transfected with either control siRNA or MYC siRNA
and then exposed to 6 μM diMF starting 24-hours after transfection. Cell viability was
determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay at day 4 after transfection. For data in A,
C, and D, each data point represents the average of 3 independent experiments with
data collected in triplicate (n=9). Error bars represent the standard deviation. The
pairwise comparisons were done using two tailed, unpaired t-tests. The symbol *
indicates p<0.01 compared to DMSO for A and compared to control RNAi groups in C
and D.

Figure 5: diMF is not synthetic lethal with a variety of other oncoproteins
Rat1A cells harboring either an empty vector or one of the indicated oncogenes, were
treated with either 0.1% DMSO (□), 6 μM diMF (■) or 300 nM VX-680 (■) for 3 days.
Cell viability, was assayed using the Trypan blue exclusion assay. Each data point is
the average of three independent experiments, with treatments done in triplicate (n=9).
Error bars denote standard deviation. For cells overexpressing MYC and the N1ICD,

viability of the diMF and VX-680 groups was statistically different from DMSO (one-way
ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test). The symbol * indicates p<0.01 for drug treated
compared to DMSO control.

Figure 6: MYC-diMF synthetic lethality is not due to a general priming of
apoptosis
Cells overexpressing (RPE-MYC) or not overexpressing (RPE-NEO) MYC were
treated for 72 hours with various chemical primers of apoptosis: DCB (2µg/ml), VX-680
(300 nM), Paclitaxel (5 µM), Nocodazole (1µg/ml), Eg5 inhibitor II (10µM), Monastrol (20
µM), Doxorubicin (200 nM), Cisplatin (200 µM), Etoposide (20 µM), Zeocin (50 µg/ml),
Cycloheximide (10 µg/ml), Staurosporine (10 µM), serum withdrawal and 0.1% DMSO
as a control group. Cell viability was assayed by Trypan blue exclusion assay. Each
column represents the average of three independent experiments, with three replicates
in each experiment (n=9). Error bars denote standard deviation. Viability differences
between RPE-NEO and RPE-MYC cells with each chemical were statistically compared
using two tailed, unpaired t-tests. The symbol * indicates p<0.01.
