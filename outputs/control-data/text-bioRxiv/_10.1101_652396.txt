Objective: To develop a highly polygenic risk score (PRS) for alcohol consumption and study whether
it predicts alcohol-related morbidity and all-cause mortality.
Design: Biobank-based prospective cohort study
Setting: FinnGen Study (Finland)
Participants: 96,499 genotyped participants from the nationwide prospective FinnGen study and
36,499 participants from prospective cohorts (Health 2000, FINRISK, Twin Cohort) with detailed
baseline data and up to 25 years of follow-up time.
Main outcome measures: Incident alcohol-related morbidity and alcohol-related or all-cause
mortality, based on hospitalizations, outpatient specialist care, drug purchases, and death reports.
Results: In 96,499 FinnGen participants there were in total 4,785 first-observed incident alcoholrelated health events. The PRS of alcohol consumption was associated with alcohol-related
morbidity and the risk estimate (hazard ratio, HR) between the highest and lowest quintiles of the
PRS was 1.67 [ 95 % confidence interval: 1.52-1.84], p=3.2*10-27). In 28,639 participants with
comprehensive baseline data from prospective Health 2000 and FINRISK cohorts, 911 incident first
alcohol-related events were observed. When adjusted for self-reported alcohol consumption,
education, marital status, and gamma-glutamyl transferase blood levels, the risk estimate between
the highest and lowest quintiles of the PRS was 1.58 (CI=[1.26-1.99], p=8.2*10-5). The PRS was also
associated with all-cause mortality with a risk estimate of 1.33 between the highest and lowest
quintiles (CI=[1.2-1.47], p=4.5e-08) in the adjusted model. In all 39,695 participants with selfreported alcohol consumption available, a 1 SD increase in the PRS was associated with 11.2 g (=0.93
drinks) higher weekly alcohol consumption (β=11.2 [9.85-12.58 g], p = 2.3*10-58).
Conclusions: The PRS for alcohol consumption associates for both alcohol-related morbidity and allcause mortality. These findings underline the importance of heritable factors in alcohol-related
behavior and the related health burden. The results highlight how measured genetic risk for an
important behavioral risk factor can be used to predict related health outcomes.

Introduction

62
63

Alcohol drinking is a major dose-dependent contributor to morbidity and mortality. Globally, 3

64

million annual deaths (5 % of all deaths) result from alcohol consumption, and is also linked to more

65

than 200 disease and injury outcomes.(1) As ethanol is a psychoactive substance with addictive

66

properties,(2) alcohol consumption can lead to the development of alcohol use disorders (AUDs),

67

globally prevalent mental disorders of pathological addictive or abusive drinking patterns, which are

68

linked to worse health outcomes, negative socioeconomic effects, and increased mortality.(3) There

69

is a strong connection between the health burden and the level of alcohol consumed, (4) and in

70

total alcohol has been estimated to be the most damaging of all substances of abuse, in terms of

71

harm caused to self and others.(5)

72
73

Alcohol-related behaviors are also affected by genetic factors and the estimated heritability of

74

alcohol consumption in twin studies has ranged between 35% and 65% (weighted average 37%) (6)

75

and its single nucleotide polymorphism -based heritability has been estimated to be 10%. (7) Recent

76

large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci associated with

77

alcohol consumption, underlining the importance of large study populations for unraveling the

78

genetic architecture underlying alcohol-related traits. (7, 8) Similarly, GWAS of alcohol dependence

79

and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores have shown the traits to be

80

genetically distinct but positively correlated.(9,10)

81
82

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) derived from GWAS summary statistics have showcased improved

83

performance in disease prediction. (11) PRSs for known risk factors have also been shown to

84

associate with the related disease (12) and recently associations between multiple risk factor PRSs

85

and related traits were confirmed and reported. (13, 14) However, the link between PRSs for

86

behavioral traits and associated health outcomes remains poorly understood.

87
88

The assessment of potential health risks related to alcohol has so far relied on traditional risk factors,

89

including family history, without explicit measurement of genetic risk. Here we developed a highly

90

polygenic risk score for alcohol consumption and studied whether alcohol-related polygenic burden

91

predicts alcohol-use disorders and other alcohol-related morbidity and mortality in Finnish biobank

92

cohorts (n=96,499) linked to electronic health records. Furthermore, we studied whether the PRS

93

for alcohol consumption predicts alcohol-related outcomes beyond self-reported alcohol

94

consumption and other related risk factors, thus providing more objective information independent

95

of individual reporting bias or temporal fluctuations.

Study sample and definition of alcohol-related morbidity

100

The data is comprised of 96,499 Finnish individuals from FinnGen Data Freeze 2, which includes

101

prospective epidemiological and disease-based cohorts as well as hospital biobank samples

102

(Supplementary Table 1). The data were linked by the unique national personal identification

103

numbers to national hospital discharge, death, and medication reimbursement registries. Additional

104

details and information on the genotyping and imputation are provided in the online-only

105

Supplementary Information.

106
107

Alcohol-related baseline measures were available for a subset of the FinnGen dataset consisting of

108

national population survey cohorts: FINRISK, collected in 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012 and

109

Health 2000, collected in 2000. The baseline data included self-reported information assessed by

110

questionnaires, anthropometric measures, and blood samples. More detailed descriptions of the

111

FINRISK and Health 2000 studies have been published previously.(15,16)

112
113

Additionally, three Finnish twin cohorts, FinnTwin12, NAG-FIN, and Old Twin were pooled and

114

analyzed as one dataset. For these datasets, cohort baseline data was available, but the cohorts

115

were not linked to electronical health records. For details regarding the twin datasets, see the online

116

descriptions ( https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/twineng/Twinstudy ). (17,18)

117
118

Using nationwide registries for deaths (1969-2016), hospital discharges (1969-2016), outpatient

119

specialist appointments (1998-2016) and drug purchases (1995-2016), we combined 21 somatic and

120

psychiatric alcohol-related diagnoses into a composite disease endpoint, harmonizing the

121

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) revisions 8, 9 and 10, and ATC-codes (Supplementary

122

Table 1). These registries spanning decades were electronically linked to the cohort baseline data

Genotyping and imputation

127
128

FinnGen, FINRISK, Health2000, and Finnish Twin Cohort samples were genotyped with Illumina and

129

Affymetrix genomewide SNP arrays. Individuals with non-European ancestry or uncertain sex were

130

excluded. The details about the genotype calling, quality controls and imputation are provided in

131

the Supplementary Information.

132
133

Polygenic risk scores

134
135

Summary statistics from the largest existing GWAS meta-analysis on alcohol consumption (8) were

136

used for constructing the PRS. To avoid overfitting, a separate ad hoc meta-analysis was performed

137

by GSCAN, excluding all Finnish and 23andMe samples (n=527,282 after exclusions). The LDpred-inf

138

method (19) was used to account for linkage disequilibrium (LD) among loci, with whole-genome

139

sequencing data on 2,690 Finns serving as the external LD reference panel. The final scores were

140

generated with PLINK2 (20) by calculating the weighted sum of risk allele dosages for each variant.

141

The number of variants in the final scores was 1.1*106.

142
143

Statistical analysis

144
145

The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate survival curves, hazard ratios (HRs) and

146

95 % confidence interval (95% CI) in the survival analyses where age was used as the time scale. R’s

147

cox.zph function was used to test whether the proportional assumption criteria applied in our

148

models. Linear regression in FINRISK and Health 2000 and linear mixed model in the Twin Cohort

149

was used for estimating the relationship between the PRS and alcohol consumption. Logistic

150

regression in the FINRISK and Health 2000 cohorts and linear mixed model in the Twin Cohort was

151

used to estimate the relationship between alcohol abstinence and the PRS.

152
153

Age, sex, genotyping array, and the first ten principal components of ancestry were used as core

154

covariates. Additionally, body mass was used as a covariate in the model estimating the PRS-alcohol

155

consumption relationship. Self-reported weekly average alcohol consumption from the past year

156

(when unavailable, the past week’s consumption) was used as the estimate for alcohol

157

consumption. In the fully adjusted survival model analyses, log(x+1) -transformed alcohol

158

consumption-estimate, current smoking status, binary higher education status, binary

159

marital/cohabitation status and GGT (Gamma Glutamyl Transferase) blood levels at baseline served

160

as covariates.

161
162

In the survival analyses, all prevalent cases and individuals with covariate missingness were

163

excluded. The PRS was normalized and included as a continuous variable in the models. In the

164

survival analysis the highest and lowest genetic risk for alcohol consumption were compared using

165

PRS quintiles.

166
167

In analyses using baseline consumption data, the analyses were performed separately in the Health

168

2000, FINRISK Study, and Twin Cohorts and then meta-analyzed using fixed effects model.

169
170

In risk prediction, FINRISK cohorts with at least 10 years of follow-up (from 1992 to 2002) were used

171

to train the model, and the predictive performance was tested in the Health 2000 cohort. The

172

maximal follow-up window was restricted to 10 years. The change in the predictive performance

173

was assessed by comparing models with and without the PRS using the correlated C-index approach

174

(21) along with calculating the continuous reclassification improvement (NRI) (22) and integrated

175

discrimination improvement (IDI).(23) The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used to test

176

model calibration.

178

Patient and public involvement

179
180

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they

181

involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation of the study. No patients

182

were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no plans to disseminate

183

the results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient community.

Our primary dataset (FinnGen) is comprised of 96,499 unrelated individuals (54,262 women) with a

190

total of 55,484,114 person-years of registry-based follow-up and 4,785 first-observed alcohol-

192

individuals from the prospective cohorts (FINRISK, Health 2000 and Twin Cohort). Two cohorts,

193

FINRISK and Health 2000, have full registry data and information on self-reported alcohol

194

consumption and related baseline data and consist of 28,639 individuals (94.5% of the participants

195

after excluding 964 prevalent alcohol-related morbidity cases), with 424,053 person-years of

196

registry-based follow-up and 988 first ever alcohol-related events. The interview-based DSM-IV

201

Alcohol consumption

202
203

In a meta-analysis of the three cohorts with alcohol consumption estimates available (n=39,888),

204

the PRS for alcohol consumption was strongly associated with self-reported alcohol consumption.

205

A one SD increase in the PRS was associated with an 11.2 g (= 0.93 drinks á 12g) increase in weekly

206

pure alcohol intake (beta=11.2 [9.85-12.6 g], p = 2.3*10-58) (Fig 1, cohort-specific figures in the

207

supplementary material). Adding the PRS to the model improved r2 by ~0.6 percentage points (from

208

9.17 % to 9.80 %). In addition, the PRS was negatively associated with alcohol abstinence (reported

209

alcohol consumption 0). In FINRISK and Health2000, a 1 SD increase in the PRS for alcohol

210

consumption was associated with a 13.7% reduced likelihood of being a nondrinker (OR=0.863

211

[0.833-0.895], p=6.1*10-16) while this was not case in the Twin Cohort where there were only 30

212

nondrinkers (OR=0.999[0.998-1.00] p=0.31). Cohort-specific figures for sex-specific alcohol

213

consumption are in the supplementary material.

Alcohol-related morbidity

221

The PRS for alcohol consumption was strongly associated with increased risk for lifelong major

222

alcohol-related events derived from electronic health-records in the FinnGen dataset (n=96,499,

223

cases = 4,785) (Figure 2). The difference in the risk for alcohol-related morbidity events between

224

the lowest and highest risk quintiles in the PRS was 67 % (HR=1.67 [1.52-1.84], p=3.2*10-27) and a 1

225

SD increase in the PRS was associated with a 21 % increase in risk (HR=1.21 [1.18-1.25], p =1.4*10-

226

40

227

(HR=1.22 [1.16-1-29], p=4.3^10-14).

). The association was similar in both males (HR=1.21 [1.17-1.26], p=1.8*10-28) and females

228
229

Figure 2. The FinnGen dataset was divided into three groups consisting of the lowest quintile, three

230

middle quintiles and the highest quintile of the alcohol consumption PRS. The cumulative disease

231

rate of alcohol-related morbidity is displayed as a function of age (n=96,499).

232

In the cohorts where alcohol consumption estimates and other related baseline data were available

233

at the cohort entry time, the PRS was associated with an increased risk of incident major alcohol-

234

related events and the association was maintained also in the fully adjusted model (n = 28,639,

235

cases = 911). In a meta-analysis of the two cohorts 1 PRS SD was associated with a 26% increased

236

risk of incident alcohol-related events when the consumption-estimate was not in the model

237

(HR=1.26 [1.18-1.34], p=1.1*10-12) and with a 15 % increase when alcohol consumption was in the

238

model (HR=1.15 [1.08-1.22], p=2.1*10-5). In a fully adjusted model, including marital status,

239

education, smoking status and GGT, the estimate were unchanged (HR=1.15 [1.08-1.22], p=2.0*10-

240

5

) (Table 2).

241
242

Mortality

243
244

We observed a similar increase in the risk of alcohol-related and all-cause mortality. In FinnGen with

245

7,249 deaths one SD increase in the PRS for alcohol consumption was associated with 7 % increase

246

in the risk of death (HR= 1.07 [1.05-1.10], p = 4.3*10-9). The risk estimate between the highest and

247

lowest 20 % in the PRS was 1.23 (HR = 1.23 [1.14-1.23], p = 1.22*10-8). In our prospective cohorts,

248

with cause-of-death information available, 4,125 deaths were recorded (Table 2). For all-cause

249

mortality there was 11 % increase in the risk of death per 1 PRS SD in the basic model (HR=1.11[1.07-

250

1.14], p =3.2*10-10) and 9 % in the fully adjusted model (HR = 1.09 [1.06-1.12], p=1.1*10-7). The risk

251

difference between the highest and lowest quintiles of the PRS was 33 % (HR=1.33 [1.2-1.47],

252

p=4.5e-08) in the fully adjusted model.

253
254

Of the 4,125 deaths 335 were known to be alcohol-related. Without alcohol consumption in the

255

model, the increase in alcohol-related mortality was 26 % per 1 PRS SD (HR=1.26 [1.13-1.4],

256

p=3.7*10-5). When alcohol consumption was included in the model, the increase was 13 % (HR=1.13

257

[1.01-1.26], p=0.027) and in a model with all co-variates, 11 % (HR=1.11 [0.996-1.24], p=0.058)

258

(Table 2). Similarly, the PRS was associated with a higher risk of death from other than alcohol-

259

related causes (n=3,790) when fully adjusted for all covariates (HR=1.08 [1.05-1.12], p=1.4*10-6).

Prediction

280

The predictive performance of the PRS was evaluated in the Health 2000 cohort (5,732 complete

281

cases, 110 events) with a follow-up-window of 10 years based on the Cox model trained in the

282

FINRISK cohort (18427 complete cases with ≥10 years of follow-up, 628 events). In a model not

283

including the alcohol consumption estimate, adding the PRS to the model increased the C-index by

284

0.020, from 0.69 to 0.71 (p = 0.017). Both IDI (0.00242 [0.00102-0.00383], p = 7.3*10-4) and NRI

285

(0.335 [0.146-0.523], p = 5.1*10-3) shifts were positive and statistically significant. When the log-

286

transformed alcohol consumption estimate was included, a modest improvement of prediction was

287

observed (C-index=0.0022 from 0.812 to 0.814, p-value=0.30; NRI=0.308 [0.119-0.497], p = 0.0014

288

and IDI=0.00173 [0.000726-0.00305], p = 0.017). Similarly, a modest gain was observed when adding

289

PRS to a model with all available covariates including also marital status, education status, smoking

290

status and GGT (C-index=0.00183 from 0.847 to 0.849, p=0.44; NRI=0.235 [0.0461-0.423], p=0.015;

291

IDI =0.00331[0.0000254-0.00659], p = 0.048).

293

Discussion

294

We developed a highly polygenic risk score for alcohol consumption by obtaining weights from a

295

recently published large-scale discovery sample and showed that the PRS was strongly associated

296

with alcohol consumption in independent biobank cohort samples. An increased polygenic burden

297

for alcohol consumption was associated with higher incidence of major alcohol-induced health

298

events. The associations remained significant when we accounted for self-reported alcohol

299

consumption and other relevant covariates; in a fully adjusted model the relative risk-estimate

300

between the highest and lowest quintiles of the polygenic risk score was 1.6. Furthermore, the PRS

301

was also associated with both alcohol-related, non-alcohol related and all-cause mortality.

302
303

Comparison with other studies

304
305

Our PRS shows the utility of genetic information for prediction of alcohol-related harm. The PRS,

306

developed from a genetic analysis of cross-sectional self-reported alcohol consumption, was

307

associated with future risk of major alcohol-related health events. While a large number of PRSs

308

have already been established for various traits and diseases (11), the development of PRSs for

309

behavioral traits, such as substance use, has until now been limited (24-27) and the studies have

310

not assessed their impact on future major health events.

311
312

Implications

313
314

Our results show that using a large sample size with long follow-up, we were able to build a PRS of

315

alcohol consumption that is associated not only with alcohol consumption in independent samples,

316

but also with future incident alcohol-related health events. In line with the knowledge that alcohol

317

consumption is a major contributor to the worldwide burden of death, especially among working-

318

age adults (1), we found the PRS to be associated also with all-cause mortality, further highlighting

319

the importance of alcohol drinking as a cause of premature death.

320
321

Our score provides a genetic basis for potentially identifying a subset of high-risk individuals even

322

early on in life, with potential for more targeted prevention of AUDs and other alcohol-related

323

morbidity. Prevention is a cost-effective and efficient strategy to reduce alcohol related harms (28)

324

and it is labeled one of the United Nations main health-related worldwide strategies of sustainable

325

development ( https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg3 ). A higher genetic predisposition for

326

alcohol-related harms was detected both in the presence and absence of alcohol consumption data,

327

as our PRS predicted alcohol-related harms beyond self-reported alcohol consumption. Health

328

services are encouraged to support initiatives for screening and brief interventions for harmful

329

drinking (29) as an effective strategy for tackling alcohol-related harm.(30) Thus, genetic

330

information could potentially be used to improve the arsenal of possible strategies to detect high-

331

risk individuals for targets of brief interventions. The fact that individuals in the highest PRS quintile

332

showed an elevated risk for alcohol-related health events even in fully adjusted models could justify

333

the use of genetic information even in clinical settings where a detailed history of alcohol

334

consumption estimates, AUDIT-scores, or similar information are attainable. Communicating the

335

information of higher risk for alcohol-related harm to patients could serve as a motivator for

336

reducing drinking or committing to abstinence. The effect of being aware of one’s negative

337

expectations could also be unwanted, as is thought to be the case in the stereotype threat

338

phenomenon. (31-34)

339
340

Self-reported alcohol consumption is known to be biased and problematic in terms of reliability and

341

validity for predicting alcohol-related risks (35,36). Some bias derives from true measurement error,

342

but another source is the lifelong temporal fluctuation of alcohol-drinking patterns not captured by

343

a measure at one single timepoint. Our PRS was associated with alcohol-related harms even when

344

adjusting for self-reported alcohol consumption estimate. One potential reason for this is that the

345

PRS contains information from the latent genetic predisposition for alcohol consumption, thus

346

overriding both the true measurement error and temporal fluctuations in alcohol drinking volume.

347
348

It has been hypothesized that alcohol consumption-based genetic discovery might inform more

349

about low-level drinking than about problematic drinking and AUDs.(37) However, we built a

350

polygenic risk score for alcohol consumption and successfully used it to predict alcohol-related

351

harms. Due to the robustness of a self-reported single timepoint alcohol consumption estimate and

352

the fact that different alcohol-related traits are to some degree genetically distinct,(9,10) it is

353

expected that a PRS developed directly for alcohol-related morbidity will outperform our PRS in

354

predicting alcohol-related health burden. Supporting this assumption, the general pattern is that

355

PRSs are more strongly associated with their respective diseases than with related phenotypes.

356

(13,14) Unfortunately, no high-quality summary statistics for alcohol-related harms including both

357

somatic and psychiatric outcomes yet exist; the performed GWAS have only covered alcohol

358

dependence (10) and been far smaller in size than our discovery sample of choice, thus making

359

future efforts for large-scale GWAS discovery based on alcohol-related harms more than necessary.

360
361

Strengths and limitations

362
363

Our polygenic risk score was derived using European ancestry discovery samples and tested in the

364

Finnish population. Its applicability in other populations therefore needs further evaluation as the

365

alcohol-related genetic mechanisms may vary between populations. However, it has to be noted

366

that the PRS derived from a non-Finnish sample performed well in the Finnish dataset, even though

367

Finns are somewhat genetically different from the rest of the Europeans (38).

368
369

Our design allowed us to study outcomes prospectively. Our registry-based follow-up captures

and deaths, thus covering major alcohol-related health events over several decades. Nonetheless,

372

some of the milder cases of alcohol-related health problems could have gone undetected.

373
374

Conclusions

375
376

In conclusion, a polygenic risk score for alcohol consumption was associated with elevated risk for

377

incident alcohol-related health events and all-cause mortality. These findings underline the

378

importance of heritable factors driving alcohol-related behavior. A successful attempt to predict

379

alcohol-related health outcomes with a polygenic risk score shows promise in possible future

380

utilization of genetic information in risk estimation and prediction of alcohol-related harms.
