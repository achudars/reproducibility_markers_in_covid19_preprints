Abstract

22

The primeval function of the mammalian hippocampus (HPC) remains uncertain.

23

Implicated in learning and memory, spatial navigation, and neuropsychological

24

disorders, evolutionary theory suggests that the HPC evolved from a primeval

25

chemosensory epithelium. Internal sensing deficits in patients with HPC lesions

26

argue that internal sensing may be conserved in higher vertebrates. We studied the

27

expression of 250 endocrine receptors in mouse brain. Key findings are (i) the

28

proportions and levels of endocrine receptor expression in the HPC are significantly

29

higher than in all other comparable brain regions. (ii) Surprisingly, the distribution of

30

endocrine receptor expression within mouse HPC was found to be highly structured:

31

receptors signaling 'challenge' are segregated in dentate gyrus (DG), whereas those

32

signaling 'sufficiency' are principally found in cornu ammonis (CA) regions. Selective

33

expression of endocrine receptors in the HPC argues that internal sensing remains a

34

core feature of hippocampal function. Further, we report that ligands of DG receptors

35

predominantly inhibit both synaptic potentiation and neurogenesis, whereas CA

36

receptor ligands conversely promote both synaptic potentiation and neurogenesis.

37

These findings suggest that the hippocampus acts as an integrator of body status,

38

extending its role in context-dependent memory encoding from 'where' and 'when' to

39

'how I feel'. Implications for anxiety and depression are discussed.

41

Introduction

42

Current thinking predominantly attributes to the hippocampus (HPC) a pivotal role in

43

learning and memory, in spatial navigation, and in anxiety, stress, and depression.

44

However, the central function of the HPC in both memory and neuropsychological

45

disorders may be consistent with an underlying role in internal sensing (interoception).

46

Previous studies have implicated cortical regions, limbic brain, and thalamus, as well

47

as the hypothalamus and brainstem regions, among others, in interoception [1]. The

48

HPC (and adjoining amygdala) is a prominent contender – in addition to his profound

49

learning and memory deficits following HPC surgery to alleviate severe recurrent

50

epilepsy [2], the famous patient H.M. was unable to sense internal states [3]. Similar

51

observations have been made in rodents with selective HPC lesions [4-6].

52

A role for the HPC in internal sensing is consistent with evolutionary theory

53

that the HPC (and olfactory system) arose from a chemosensory epithelium, but with

54

the closing of the brain ventricles during evolution the hippocampus retained the

55

capacity to sense the internal milieu of the body [7-9]. It is of note that the 'rostral

56

migratory stream' in neonatal mice directly connects the HPC and the chemosensing

57

olfactory system [10], consistent with a common developmental origin. In addition, a

58

key characteristic of traditional sensory epithelia such as the olfactory system and

59

retina in many vertebrate species is that neurogenesis continues into adulthood

60

[11,12], and neurogenesis is also prominent in adult hippocampus, principally

61

underlying the dentate gyrus (DG) (reviewed in [13].

62

Internal sensing is a key modulator of behavior. Hunger and thirst are induced

63

by deficiencies in nutrient and water, respectively, and elicit clear adaptive

64

motivations and behaviors. Other diverse internal states, ranging from salt deficiency

65

to hormonal status to inflammation/infection, exert powerful effects on multiple

66

aspects of brain function, centrally including adaptive behavior as well as learning

67

and memory, but the target brain region(s) and receptors remain poorly defined.

68

The anatomy of the mammalian HPC is consistent with an internal sensory

69

role. The hippocampal formation lies at the interface (limbus, 'fringe') between the

70

lower brain and the mass of the cerebral cortex. In terms of blood supply, the HPC is

71

perhaps the most highly irrigated of all brain regions, and is also flanked by the

72

central and lateral ventricles with the choroid plexus [14]. In cross-section, the

73

formation is divided into CA regions CA1 and CA3 (with a short intervening structure,

74

CA2), and the DG. There may be a further functionally distinct region, the dentate

75

hilus, but this is less secure. Gene expression surveys largely confirm this anatomy

76

[15,16]. Some have introduced additional subdivisions both within the DG–CA circuit

77

[17] and along the length of the hippocampus [18]. However, for simplicity we retain

78

the conventional subdivisions CA1–CA3 and DG.

79

To address the physiological role of the HPC we previously employed

80

differential hybridization [19], candidate gene screening [20], and gene-trapping [21]

81

to identify genes selectively expressed in HPC. This revealed that the mouse HPC

82

expresses several receptors and signaling molecules, potentially indicating a role of

83

the HPC in internal sensing of body physiology [9]. The aim of the present study was

84

therefore to test rigorously the hypothesis that the hippocampus is involved in

85

interoception through systematic analysis of the expression patterns of endocrine

86

receptors across mouse brain, including subregions of the HPC.

87

Specifically, we sought to answer two central questions. (i) Does the mouse

88

HPC express a greater diversity and/or level of endocrine receptors than other brain

89

regions such as the cortex and the cerebellum? (ii) If a greater level of expression is

90

found, are these receptors expressed uniformly across the HPC, or are different

91

receptors differently distributed in the different subdivisions of the HPC? – and can

92

the pattern of expression tell us anything about the function of the HPC? We report

93

that the HPC is the principal brain site of endocrine receptor expression and, perhaps

94

surprisingly, this analysis revealed a highly segregated distribution of receptor

95

expression in mouse hippocampus.

METHODS

100

Endocrine receptors

101

A list was assembled of receptor molecules in mice and humans that respond to

102

endocrine (blood-borne) ligands. We elected to study 250 receptors, a number

103

chosen to minimize the risk that a small number of atypical receptors or experimental

104

artifacts might bias the overall picture, weighed against the labor-intensive

105

constraints of manually analyzing a larger number of receptors. To assemble the list,

106

the GeneCards database (www.genecards.org) was searched at random for

107

genes/gene products containing 'receptor'. A preliminary list (>>250 receptor

108

candidates) was manually filtered to exclude (i) non-receptor entries (e.g., receptor

109

downstream kinase, etc.), (ii) evident receptors for neurotransmitter and non-

110

diffusible cell–cell interaction molecules, and (iii) receptors not listed in the primary

111

database consulted (Allan Brain Atlas) as well as receptors whose expression profiles

112

were classified as failing quality control. Although principally cell-surface molecules,

113

the final list includes intracellular receptors with an endocrine role (e.g., nuclear

114

receptors). This generated a list of 253 endocrine receptors (Table S1 in the

115

supplementary material online; the molecular functions of specific groups of receptors

116

are discussed in Box S1).

117
118

Quantification of mouse brain endocrine receptor expression data

119

Primary analysis relied on the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA; http://mouse.brain-map.org/), a

120

publicly available repository of in situ hybridization gene expression data across

121

mouse brain [22] made available by the Allen Institute for Brain Science established

122

by Paul G. Allen. To retrieve expression patterns we entered search terms (e.g.,

123

Gene1) into http://mouse.brain-map.org/search/show, sagittal sections were selected

124

in all cases when these were available. The 'expression' option and the target brain

125

region (typically mid-brain including the hippocampus) were selected, a screenshot

126

was taken; data for all 253 receptors were recorded at the same magnification and

127

intensity in a repository of image files. To quantitate expression levels ImageJ [23,24]

128

was employed. Using default settings, and a standard image size, representative

129

brain regions (HPC; cortex, CX; and cerebellum, CB) were selected using a cursor

130

box of constant size and analyzed using the 'measure' function of ImageJ (the

131

olfactory bulb could not be systematically analyzed because this structure can be lost

132

during dissection, and the small relative size of the mouse hypothalamus precludes

133

analysis at the resolution afforded by ABA). In each case the 'Mean' function was

134

used instead of the integrated density function 'IntDen' because, at constant image

135

size, the relative values are the same. The same technique was used for

136

hippocampal subregions, but the cursor box was manually fitted to the separate

137

regions (CA1, CA2, CA3, DG). The 'Mean' function in these cases represents relative

138

(total) expression of the target gene within the region measured. These analyses

139

generate a digital intensity reading on a scale of 0 to 255. The program

140

accommodates different colors as follows: black, 0.00; red, 85/255 (0.333); yellow,

141

170/255 (0.666); white, 255/255 (1.000), mirroring the output of the ABA. Because

142

region selection is to some extent subjective, subregion expression analysis was

143

performed by two independent researchers; in cases of disparity consensus was

144

reached following reanalysis of the primary data. Values were then normalized – a

145

biologically realistic data transformation because (i) the signal for each target

146

depends on the hybridization properties of the specific probe employed, (ii) the

147

biological effects of a given receptor will vary across a wide range depending on

148

ligand concentration, ligand affinity, and downstream signal transduction, and (iii) for

149

a given gene, the inter-regional pattern (ratio) of expression across the

150

brain/hippocampus (unlike absolute values) is likely to be independent of the specific

151

probe/hybridization parameters. For normalization, the highest expression value was

152

selected (100%) and expression in other regions was expressed as a percentage of

153

maximum. Inter-region expression ratios in whole brain were calculated from the un-

154

normalized expression data. Primary data for receptor gene expression across the

155

brain are given in supplementary Table S2, and for hippocampal subregions in

156

supplementary Table S3.

157
158

Heat mapping and statistical analysis

159

All analyses focused on genes that were expressed in at least one of the selected

160

brain regions (98 genes in Figure 1, and 86 genes in Figure 2), and were conducted

161

in the R programming environment, version 3.3.3 [25]. Heatmaps were generated

162

using heatmap.2 in the gplots library for R. Note that heatmap.2 provides

163

dendrograms to aid visualization of relationships among components of the heatmap

164

but provides no statistics to indicate support for the presented dendrograms versus

165

alternative, competing dendrograms. Therefore, we strongly caution against

166

overinterpretation of the dendrograms presented.

167

To test whether gene expression profiles differ across brain regions (HPC, CX,

168

and CB) we measured the correlation in gene expression among brain regions. To

169

this end, we analyzed normalized gene expression (see above) because variation in

170

probe affinity may generate spurious correlations. We calculated the correlation using

171

arcsine square root transformed values of normalized gene expression, and used

172

case-bootstrapping to generate 95% confidence intervals (R package ‘boot’ [26,27];

173

bootstrapped 10 000 replicates).

174

Wilcoxon signed rank tests and paired t tests were used to determine whether

175

non-normalized gene expression differed among brain regions (Wilcoxon tests to

176

compare HPC, CX and CB; paired t tests to compare CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG). We

177

used Chi-square goodness of fit tests to determine whether genes that are

178

exclusively (or alternatively, predominantly) expressed in HPC, CB, or CX are

179

distributed equally among these regions. We used a series of three binomial tests to

180

determine whether the numbers of genes expressed differed among HPC, CB and

181

CX. Pairwise correlation analysis is given in Table S4.

182
183

Informative genes

184

For the majority of receptor genes the biological function of the receptor and/or the

185

identity of the ligand(s) remains unknown. For further analysis we therefore selected

186

an 'informative' subset of 32 genes where information is available concerning the

187

biological role (or inferred role) of the ligand/receptor pair. This subset included

188

receptors

189

190

and growth factors (e.g., fibroblast growth factor). The list of informative genes is

employed for HippoSeq data (below).

Analysis of receptor function

239

PubMed was searched for the name of each individual receptor in conjunction with

240

'synaptic potentiation' OR 'synaptic plasticity' OR 'long-term potentiation' OR 'LTP'

241

OR 'neurogenesis'. Relevant publications were manually tabulated for ligand effects

242

on both parameters and are listed in Table S8. Intergroup pairwise comparisons of

243

effects (inhibition versus stimulation) of literature-recorded ligands on LTP and

244

neurogenesis employed both Student's unpaired t test and chi-square test.

246

RESULTS

247

A representative list of 253 endocrine receptors was compiled (neurotransmitter

248

receptors and cell–cell interaction molecules were excluded; supplementary Table

249

S1). In situ hybridization patterns were extracted from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas

250

(ABA); these were manually scanned and quantified (Methods). Where appropriate,

251

values were normalized and inter-region ratios calculated.

252
253

Brain distribution of endocrine receptor expression

254

We report that, of all endocrine receptors, 98/253 (38.7%) were detectably expressed

255

in brain. This argues that, in addition to regulating body physiology including growth,

256

development, reproduction, and homeostasis, etc., a major proportion of endocrine

257

receptors may directly regulate brain function and cognition.

258

We also report that endocrine receptor expression in mouse brain is limited to

259

specific brain regions. Only a small number of genes were expressed in major areas

260

such as the olfactory bulb (OLF), thalamus, pons/medulla, pallidum, or striatum

261

(4.3%; see below). This focused our attention on HPC, cortex (CX), and cerebellum

262

(CB). Hypothalamus could not be examined (Methods and Discussion).

263

Regarding our first question – the proportion of endocrine receptors expressed

264

in mouse HPC – we report that 86 of 253 (34.0%) endocrine receptors are expressed

265

in HPC, a higher number than in either CB (53) or CX (76). Importantly, the level of

266

expression in was highest in HPC. Of all receptors with detectable expression in

267

brain (n = 98), 61.3% were most prominently expressed in the principal neuronal

268

layers (pyramidal and granule cells) of the HPC (versus 9.1% in CB and 25.5% in

269

CX). Indeed, 17.3% of brain-expressed endocrine receptors were exclusively

270

expressed in HPC (compared to 4.1% and 7.1% that were exclusively expressed in

271

CB and CX, respectively). Fig. 1 presents heatmaps of the normalized and un-

272

normalized expression data for these three brain regions, and the inset gives

273

numerical values for exclusivity, most prominent, and detectable expression.

274

Non-normalized gene expression differed significantly in all pairwise

275

comparisons among HPC, CB, and CX. The HPC expressed these genes at

276

significantly higher levels than either CX or CB (Wilcoxon signed rank test; vs CX: V

277

= 3467, P = 3.266e−06; vs CB: V = 3527, P = 1.398e−08), and CX expressed genes

278

at higher levels then CB (V = 2208.5, P = 0.009944). All comparisons remained

279

significant after accounting for multiple comparisons. Overall, the probability of

280

detectable gene expression was significantly higher for HPC than CB (binomial test,

281

P = 0.0101), but did not differ for remaining comparisons (binomial tests; HPC and

282

CX: P = 0.58; CX and CB: P = 0.052); these results remain unchanged after

283

accounting for multiple comparisons.

284

Although we were unable to systematically screen for expression in OLF

285

(Methods), a very small number of genes from our selection were expressed in OLF

286

(Ednrb, Epor, Ccr3, Crhr1, Nrp1, and Nmbr) of which only Ccr3 and Nmbr appeared

287

to be specific for OLF. Remaining genes were expressed in striatum and/or pallidum

288

(Acvrl1, Nfgr, Rarb) or in pons/medulla (Adipor2, Esrrg). No other brain regions stood

289

out with other than trace expression in this survey (small foci of low-level expression,

290

not presented); in total, these represent 4.3% of all the endocrine receptors studied,

291

a far lower proportion than in either HPC, CB, or CX.

292

We conclude that, based on 253 receptors, there is significantly greater

293

endocrine receptor gene expression in HPC than in either CB or CX, or in any other

294

comparable brain region analyzed (noting that hypothalamus could not be studied;

295

Discussion).

297

Distribution across hippocampal subregions

298

With regard to our second question – the pattern of expression within the HPC – all

299

the receptors studied with detectable HPC expression (n = 86; Fig. 1) identified

300

mRNA within the cell bodies of the principal excitatory neurons (pyramidal cells, DG

301

neurons) of the HPC. However, the expression patterns of the assembled genes

were non-randomly distributed across subregions – although some were detectably

303

expressed in all subregions, many were expressed only in restricted regions of the

304

HPC. Fig. 2 presents the distribution (heatmap) of receptor expression across the

305

different regions of the mouse HPC. To address correlations between HPC

306

subregions, we performed pairwise correlation analysis (Table S4). Normalized gene

307

expression was significantly negatively correlated between DG and CA1, and

308

positively correlated between CA2 and CA3. All remaining combinations of CA1, CA2,

309

CA3, and DG provided no evidence of correlated gene expression (Table S4).

310

To validate the subregional distributions in mouse HPC, we compared ABA in

311

situ hybridization data against a second database, HippoSeq (Methods; this database

312

only addresses HPC expression). The HippoSeq database supported the overall

subregional expression patterns detected by in situ hybridization.

the ligand(s) has not been established. To illustrate, the first and last genes in our list,

320

Acvr1 and Vmnr234, respectively encode activin A receptor type 1 and a

321

vomeronasal-like receptor. Ligands for ACVR1 include both inhibins and activins, that

322

inhibit and activate diverse physiological processes and, moreover, have opposing

323

functions; the primary in vivo ligand for ACVR1 in the CNS remains unknown. For

324

VMNR234, the ligand is also unknown. Given this uncertainty we examined receptors

325

from an 'informative' list (n = 32) where the function of the ligand is known (or

326

inferred): these include angiotensins, cytokines, fibroblast growth factor (FGF),

327

interleukins/interferons, prostaglandins, retinoids, steroid hormones (androgens,

328

estrogens, glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids), tumor growth factor (TGF), and

329

tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Methods and Table 3). This revealed a gradient of

330

expression across the HPC, where some receptors were principally expressed in DG

331

regions, and others were principally expressed in CA regions (Fig. 3).

332

Receptor categorization by function. We sought a unifying principle that

333

might underpin and explain the gradient of receptor expression. It became apparent

334

that receptor function differed according to location within the HPC. Receptors

335

reflecting stress of various types (e.g., receptors for inflammatory cytokines and

336

glucocorticoids) provided a clue because their expression was clustered in DG.

337

Conversely, it was noted that receptors responding to growth-promoting ligands (e.g.,

338

growth factors and sex steroids) were principally localized in CA regions. On this

339

basis it was possible to classify each ligand/receptor pair into two groups.

340

Because one group of receptor ligands (designated 'group A') signal loss of

341

homeostasis and/or physiological stress of various types (these ligands include

342

angiotensins – blood pressure fall; glucocorticoids – stress hormones; cytokines,

343

interferons, and TNF – immune challenge), we describe these here as denoting

344

'challenge', whereas a second group of ligands ('group B') conversely includes

345

growth-promoting hormones and factors (e.g., androgens, estrogens, fibroblast

346

growth factor, retinoids), which we term here 'sufficiency' (more detailed listing and

347

discussion of receptor function is presented in Table S8 and Box S1). Although this

348

classification is fully open to debate and refinement, we believe that it provides a

349

potential interpretation of the observed gradient of expression.

350

As shown in Fig. 3, there was unexpected clustering of group A ('challenge')

351

receptor expression in DG, whereas group B ('sufficiency') receptors were

352

predominantly expressed in CA regions.

353

To address the statistical significance of the patterning of group A versus group

354

B observation we calculated the ratios between different hippocampal subregions

355

(mean of CA regions versus DG) by conversion to log10 values and subtraction

356

(Methods) and plotted the results for the two groups A and B (Fig. 4). The ratio of

357

gene expression in CA to DG differed significantly between group A and B genes

358

(Welch’s t-test, t = 4.22, df = 27.69, P = 0.00024). The same analysis was then

359

repeated for the HippoSeq data; this also achieved significance for CA regions

360

versus DG (P = 0.0016). Permutation tests confirmed these findings.

361

We conclude that the expression pattern is highly structured within mouse

362

HPC, and that group A receptors ('challenge') are preferentially expressed in DG, and

363

group B receptors ('sufficiency') are selectively expressed in CA regions (Fig. 3).

364
365

Further receptors confirm the generality of the axis

366

To test whether the axis extends to other endocrine receptors, we examined the

367

expression pattern (in both ABA and HippoSeq) of other informative receptors (that

368

were not on our original list) whose ligand is known and that are expressed in brain.

369

We identified five such receptors. All were expressed in mouse HPC (although

370

interleukin 6 receptor was only expressed at low levels, Table S7). Challenge

371

receptors (interleukin 6 receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor, opioid

372

growth factor receptor, and irisin receptor) were all expressed at higher levels in DG

373

than in CA regions, whereas sufficiency receptors were expressed at highest level in

374

CA regions (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor) or were expressed at similar levels in

375

CA and DG (leptin receptor) (Table S7), confirming (5/5) that the DG versus CA

376

differential ratio extends to other receptors, reinforcing the generality of our findings.

377
378

HPC receptors are functional: synaptic potentiation and neurogenesis

379

We addressed whether the informative receptors are functional in vivo and in vitro by

380

literature searching regarding two output measures: synaptic potentiation (long-term

381

potentiation, LTP) and neurogenesis. The evidence argues that these endocrine

382

receptors are fully functional and modulate both LTP and neurogenesis.

383

Synaptic potentiation. Although not all receptors have been studied in the

384

literature, there was evidence that DG ligands predominantly inhibit LTP, whereas CA

385

ligands promote LTP. For example, DG ligands IL-1, IL-2, IFN-α, IFN-γ, TGF-β, and

386

TNF-α all inhibit LTP in rodent hippocampus [29-36]. By contrast, CA1 ligands such

387

as cholecystokinin (CCK), different types of FGF, and somatostatin (SST) are

388

reported to enhance hippocampal LTP [37-40]. Thyroid hormone deficiency is

389

associated with pronounced deficits in synaptic plasticity (e.g., [41-43]). Caution is

390

urged, however, because some ligands may have distinct (even converse) effects on

391

CA1 versus DG LTP, perhaps pointing to functional differences in the receptors

392

expressed in different hippocampal regions. Nonetheless, based on the published

393

literature, a clear pattern emerges in which challenge ligands (DG) predominantly

394

impair LTP, whereas sufficiency ligands (CA) promote LTP (Figure 5 and Table S8).

395

Neurogenesis. The literature also records differential effects of DG and CA

396

ligands. Group A (DG/challenge) ligands such as glucocorticoids, interleukins,

397

interferons, and TNF-α are reported to inhibit neurogenesis (e.g., [44-50]) whereas

398

group B (CA/sufficiency) ligands such as estrogen, progesterone, and FGF stimulate

399

neurogenesis (e.g., [51-55]. There are some discordances, particularly when

400

comparing long- and short-term effects (for example for glucocorticoids, reviewed in

401

[47]). However, agents targeting DG predominantly suppress neurogenesis, whereas

402

those targeting CA regions increase neurogenesis (Figure 5 and Table S8).

403

Because of the small number of samples, differences between each group

404

(DG/CA)/parameter (LTP/neurogenesis) and a random distribution were not uniformly

405

significant (range P = 0.005–0.114 for four comparisons and two statistical tests). By

406

contrast, intergroup comparisons revealed that the differences between groups A and

407

B regarding LTP and neurogenesis were consistently highly significant (LTP, t test, P

408

= 0.0001; chi-square test, P = 0.0028; neurogenesis, t test, P = 0.0002; chi-square

409

test, P = 0.006) confirming that the patterns are indeed different.

410

In conclusion, ligand effects on both LTP and neurogenesis confirm that these

411

hippocampal

receptors

are

functional.

Moreover,

they

indicate

that

the

412

challenge/sufficiency axis extends to receptor function, wherein DG/challenge

receptors predominantly inhibit both neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, whereas

CA/sufficiency ligands principally promote both parameters.

416

DISCUSSION

417

This work confirms and extends prior suggestions that the HPC is involved in internal

418

sensing, as reflected here by greater expression of endocrine receptors than in any

419

other brain region, including CX and CB.

420

With regard to our first question (how many receptors), we report that 86 of

421

253 (34%) endocrine receptor genes are expressed in mouse HPC, and 17/98

422

(17.3%) are exclusively expressed in HPC, values markedly higher than for any other

423

brain region. This accords with our previous data, based on small sample size, that

424

37% (21–59%, 95% CI) of mouse genes are expressed in HPC, a selection that

425

predominantly encodes endocrine receptors and signaling molecules [21]. Aside from

426

CX and CB, only low-level expression of these receptors was observed in other

427

comparable brain regions (e.g., OLF, thalamus, pons/medulla, pallidum, or striatum;

428

hypothalamus was not studied); these represent ca 4% of all receptors studied.

429

Thus, of all major brain regions in mouse, endocrine receptor genes are most

430

prominently expressed in HPC, attesting that the present-day HPC is likely to play a

431

sensory role in sensing internal (endocrine) markers of body physiology, arguing that

432

the sensory function attributed to the primeval hippocampus [7-9] has been retained

433

to this day.

434

Our analysis has focused largely on hormonal ligands, and has not addressed

435

whether the HPC can directly sense levels of low molecular weight ligands (e.g.,

436

minerals, pH, CO2, etc.) because much less is known about their receptors. For

437

example, NHE4 (SLC9A4), that is activated by hypertonicity, is well expressed in

438

HPC (Allen Brain Atlas), but its exact function is unknown. It could mediate direct

439

sensing of metabolites, although this remains speculative. It is possible that, with

440

evolution, the mouse HPC now responds principally to peripheral hormones that act

441

as proxies for metabolite levels. For example, aldosterone, a salt regulatory hormone,

442

targets NR3C2 in the HPC.

443

Regarding our second question (patterning within the HPC), we report a highly

444

significant non-random distribution of receptor expression across different HPC

445

subregions of mouse HPC. Receptors whose biological function is known or may be

446

inferred ('informative' genes, n = 32) were expressed in a highly structured pattern

447

within the formation. Ligands signaling different aspects of challenge (termed here

448

group A: stress, infection, inflammation, blood pressure fall) were principally found to

449

target receptors expressed in DG, whereas ligands signaling aspects of sufficiency

450

(group B: androgens, endocrine FGF, estrogens, progestins, retinoic acid, thyroid

451

hormones) instead principally target the CA regions, with a mean 8.33-fold difference

452

in the DG versus CA expression ratio (P < 0.0001).

453

Although the validity of this distinction remains open to debate (see Results for

454

the underlying rationale), for the purposes of discussion we term this a

455

'challenge/sufficiency' axis. The highly ordered (DG vs CA) segregation of receptor

456

expression in mouse brain raises the question of the function of this segregation (see

457

below).

458

We also report that the challenge/sufficiency axis accurately mirrors the effects

459

of DG versus CA ligands. With few exceptions, DG/challenge receptors inhibit,

462

The contrasting effects on synaptic potentiation suggest that the hippocampus

463

might act as an integrator of positive and negative information: given the

464

paradigmatic hippocampal circuit: cortex

465

of the hippocampus is likely to represent the summation of ligand effects on DG and

466

CA regions. The recorded modulation of synaptic potentiation (and thus of overall

467

neurotransmission through the HPC) by endocrine receptor ligands leads us to

468

speculate that the ancestral function of LTP may have been to indicate relevant

469

physiological states worthy of encoding in memory traces, ranging from no LTP

470

(highly adverse context) to potent LTP (highly beneficial context).

473

(http://human.brain-map.org/) fully confirms selective endocrine receptor expression

474

in human HPC, consistent with internal sensing deficits in HPC-ablated patient H.M.

475

[3], but the human data (from elderly individuals) are not strictly comparable to the

476

analyzed data from young mice (and are therefore not presented). There are also

477

hints that DG/CA patterning may be less well conserved in human (not presented),

478

but we note that strict conservation of this patterning across vertebrates is unlikely

479

because, for example, birds and reptiles lack a morphological dentate gyrus (e.g.,

480

[56]). Indeed, there is no a priori reason why physical segregation of challenge

481

versus sufficiency signaling should be necessary. We suspect that mouse brain may

482

be a special (but informative) case – analysis of this species has pointed, for the first

483

time, to differential HPC receptor localization according to function, providing a new

484

and unexpected perspective on hippocampal function.

485

Although comprehensive in situ receptor expression data in human are so far

486

lacking, there is firm evidence that a functional challenge/sufficiency axis also

487

operates. The human HPC is at the heart of anxiety [57,58], as well as of stress

488

responses and depression. Extensive review would be out of place, but we note that

489

clinical administration of 'challenge' ligands (DG in mouse) such as IL-1α, IL-2, IFN-α,

490

IFN-β, and TNF-α produces malaise and sickness behavior [59-64], that has been

491

suggested to be akin to anxiety/depression, whereas 'sufficiency' ligands (CA regions

492

in mouse) such as androgens, IGF-1, and thyroid hormone have converse positive

493

effects (e.g., [65-67]), all of which target HPC receptors, indicating that the axis is

challenge/sufficiency ligands will be necessary to confirm this contention.

496

Nonetheless, we observe an accurate correlation between ligands targeting

497

CA regions and antidepressant/anxiolytic benefits, and the converse for DG ligands.

498

This parallels effects on neurogenesis, where CA ligands predominantly promote

499

neurogenesis in the HPC whereas DG ligands inhibit neurogenesis. This is of special

500

note given that stimulation of HPC neurogenesis has been directly linked to

501

antidepressant action and has been used for new antidepressant drug screening

502

(e.g., [68,69]); differential receptor localization may provide novel indicators for the

503

development of new antidepressants/anxiolytics.

504

In sum, the selective expression of endocrine receptors in mouse HPC, further

505

highlighted by challenge–sufficiency patterning of endocrine receptor expression,

506

argues that internal sensing remains a core function of the HPC. This accords with

507

evolutionary theory that the HPC arose from a chemosensory epithelium [7-9], and

508

argues that the present-day HPC in particular has retained the ability to monitor the

509

internal milieu of the body. Interoception mediated by the hippocampus may thus

510

provide a new dimension to context-dependent memory encoding, extending from

511

'where' and 'when' to 'how I feel'.

512

It will be vital to test these concepts in mice genetically engineered to express

513

designer receptors only in DG versus CA regions, and to study the effect of ligand

514

administration on physiology, behavior, and memory. It would also be very informative

515

to study cross-species conservation of expression in larger mammals (rabbit, sheep,

516

non-human primates) where the relative contribution of the hypothalamus (that was

517

too small to be analyzed) could be examined in detail. Moreover, in addition to

518

looking forwards (from mouse to primates), it would be highly illuminating (i) to

519

examine in detail the trajectories of endocrine receptor expression during early

520

development, and (ii) to address the expression profiles of homologs of these genes

521

in other representatives of the vertebrate lineage including birds, reptiles, and fish.

522

One promising line of investigation will be to dissect memory processes in the earliest

523

organisms that encode associations between different internal and external stimuli.

524

Addressing the earliest precedents, and the traces these have left in extant species,

525

will be a fertile territory for new insights into the operation of the human brain.

Fig. 5. Differential effects of receptor activation on long-term potentiation (LTP)

621

and neurogenesis. (A) Group A (DG/challenge). (B) Group B (CA/sufficiency).

622

Individual genes are ordered as in Figures 3 and 4. (C) Mean scores for the two

623

groups, demonstrating that group A receptors tend to suppress both LTP and

624

neurogenesis, whereas group B receptors tend to promote both parameters. The

625

differential patterns of stimulation/inhibition of LTP and neurogenesis were highly

626

significant between the two groups.
