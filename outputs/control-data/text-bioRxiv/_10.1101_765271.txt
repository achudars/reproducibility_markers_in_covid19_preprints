ABSTRACT
Biological associations are often premised upon metabolic cross-talk between the organisms,
with the N2-fixing endosymbiotic relationship between rhizobia and leguminous plants being
a prime example. Here, we report the in silico reconstruction of a metabolic network of a
Medicago truncatula plant nodulated by the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti. The nodule
tissue of the model contains five spatially distinct developmental zones and encompasses the
metabolism of both the plant and the bacterium. Flux balance analysis (FBA) suggested that
the majority of the metabolic costs associated with symbiotic nitrogen fixation are directly
related to supporting nitrogenase activity, while a minority is related to the formation and
maintenance of nodule and bacteroid tissue. Interestingly, FBA simulations suggested there
was a non-linear relationship between the rate of N2-fixation per gram of nodule and the rate
of plant growth; increasing the N2-fixation efficiency was associated with diminishing returns
in terms of plant growth. Evaluating the metabolic exchange between the symbiotic partners
provided support for: i) differentiating bacteroids having access to sugars (e.g., sucrose) as a
major carbon source, ii) ammonium being the major nitrogen export product of N2-fixing
bacteria, and iii) N2-fixation being dependent on the transfer of protons from the plant
cytoplasm to the bacteria through acidification of the peribacteroid space. Our simulations
further suggested that the use of C4-dicarboxylates by N2-fixing bacteroids may be, in part, a
consequence of the low concentration of free oxygen in the nodule limiting the activity of the
plant mitochondria. These results demonstrate the power of this integrated model to advance
our understanding of the functioning of legume nodules, and its potential for hypothesis
generation to guide experimental studies and engineering of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

INTRODUCTION
Macroorganisms are colonized by a staggering diversity of microorganisms, collectively
referred to as a ‘holobiont’ (1, 2). The intimate association between organisms is often driven
by metabolic exchanges: many insects obtain essential nutrients from obligate bacterial
symbionts (3), most plants can obtain phosphorus from arbuscular mycorrhiza in exchange for
carbon (4), and the gut microbiota is thought to contribute to animal nutrition (5, 6). Complex
global patterns often emerge during these intimate biological associations (7), especially when
nutritional inter-dependencies are involved (8-10). The communication between the two
metabolic networks of the interacting organisms may give rise to unpredicted phenotypic traits
and unexpected emergent properties. Metabolic relationships can span over a large taxonomic
range and have profound biological relevance (11-14). For example, the interactions between
bacteria and multicellular organisms have been suggested to be key drivers of evolutionary
transitions, leading to eukaryotic diversification and to the occupancy of novel niches (9, 15,
16). The study of the association of two biological entities is mainly challenged by the size of
the system and by the unpredictability of their metabolic interactions. Theoretical, systemslevel models are required to unravel the intimate functioning of metabolic associations and
eventually exploit their potential in biotechnological applications.
Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) is a paradigmatic example of the importance and the
complexity of natural biological associations. SNF is a mutualistic relationship between a
group of plant families, including the Fabaceae, and a polyphyletic group of alpha- and betaproteobacteria known as rhizobia, or a taxa of Actinobacteria (Frankia spp.), in which the
plants provide a niche and carbon to the bacteria in exchange for fixed nitrogen (17). SNF
involves constant metabolic cross-talk between the plant and the bacteria (18), and it is a
paradigmatic example of bacterial cellular differentiation (19) and sociomicrobiological
interactions (20). The rhizobia intra-cellularly colonize plant cells of a specialized organ known
as a root (or stem) nodule. The intra-cellular rhizobia (referred to as bacteroids) are surrounded
by a plant derived membrane, and the term symbiosome is used in reference to the structure
consisting of the bacteroid, the plant derived membrane (i.e., the peribacteroid membrane), and
the intervening space (i.e., the peribacteroid space). Nodules with an indeterminate structure,
such as those formed by the plant Medicago truncatula, are divided into spatially distinct
developmental zones (21) with a distal apical meristem and a proximal nitrogen fixation zone.
SNF plays a key role in the global nitrogen cycle and is central to sustainable agricultural
practices by reducing the usage of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers whose application results in a
multitude of adverse environmental consequences (22-24). Unfortunately, our ability to
maximize the benefit of SNF is limited since rhizobial inoculants are often poorly effective due
to low competitiveness (25, 26) and because rhizobium symbioses are specific to leguminous
plants. Manipulating the rhizobium – legume interaction for biotechnological purposes will
require an understanding of what we know and what we don’t know, as well as an ability to
predict the consequences of genetic changes and environmental perturbations.
From a metabolic perspective, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction (GENREs) and
constraint-based modelling has great potential to fulfill these roles. A GENRE also serves as a
comprehensive knowledgebase of an organism’s metabolism, containing hundreds to
thousands of metabolic and transport reactions, most of which are linked to the corresponding
gene(s) whose gene product(s) catalyzes the reaction (27, 28). With the aid of mathematical

approaches such as flux balance analysis (FBA), GENREs can be used to identify emergent
system-level properties, to predict active reactions, and to identify essential genes (29).
Compared to simple enrichment analyses that are typical in -omics studies, GENRE-based
methods allow for the interpretation of data in a connected manner based on network topology
and to infer the effects of changes in remote pathways on the overall cell physiology. When
considering interacting entities, for example, this approach can predict the consequence of
mutations in one organism on the metabolism of the other. However, multi-organism metabolic
reconstructions are still in their infancy, and very few examples of combined models exist
compared to single strain GENREs (8, 14, 30-32).
Despite the importance of metabolism to SNF (18), there has been limited use of
metabolic modelling in the study of rhizobia and SNF. To date, GENREs of varying quality
have been reported for only three rhizobia: Sinorhizobium meliloti (33-35), Rhizobium etli (3638), and Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens (39). Currently, M. truncatula (40) and Glycine max
(41) are the only legumes with published GENREs. With the exception of the G. max GENRE,
these GENREs have been used in preliminary analyses of SNF, providing results generally
consistent with expectations. However, all analyses to date suffer from two major limitations.
Simulations with the rhizobium models ignore plant metabolism, while simulations with the
M. truncatula GENRE involved a very limited draft S. meliloti metabolic reconstruction.
Furthermore, all simulations have focused on the final stage of SNF and have not considered
the different steps of the preceding developmental progression where metabolism remains
poorly understood (18).
Here, we report a holistic in silico representation of the integrated metabolism of the
holobiont consisting of a M. truncatula plant nodulated by S. meliloti, which we refer to as a
Virtual Nodule Environment (ViNE). Our combined, multi-compartment reconstruction
accounts for the metabolic activity of shoot and root tissues together with a nodule consisting
of five developmental zones. We report initial characterizations of ViNE using FBA, including
zone-specific metabolic properties, trade-offs between nitrogen-fixation and plant growth, and
the usage of dicarboxylates as a carbon source by bacteroids. Going forward, we expect ViNE
will provide a powerful platform for hypothesis generation aimed at understanding and
quantitatively evaluating SNF, as well as guiding attempts at engineering SNF for increased
symbiotic efficiency.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparing an improved S. meliloti metabolic reconstruction.
A new S. meliloti metabolic reconstruction was built using the existing core metabolic
reconstruction iGD726 (34) as a starting point. First, the biomass composition was updated as
summarized in Table S1. In particular, glycogen was reduced to 0.1% cell dry weight (CDW),
poly-hydroxybutyrate was reduced to 1% CDW, and high and low molecular weight
succinoglycan were reduced to 0.1% and 0.4% CDW, respectively (42). Additionally,
putrescine and spermidine were added to the biomass composition at trace concentrations (43).
The working reconstruction was manually expanded to contain accessory metabolic
pathways following our previously reported workflow (34). Briefly, the reconstruction was
expanded by the addition of one pathway at a time. For each pathway, all reactions were
individually added to the model, the gene associations and reaction equations checked against

literature sources, and where possible, each reaction was referenced (see File S2). Reactions
were predominately taken from the previously published S. meliloti genome-scale metabolic
reconstruction iGD1575 (33) when possible; otherwise, they were taken from the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (44), MetaCyc (45), ModelSEED (46), or MetaNetX (47)
databases.
An automated expansion of the metabolic network was then performed. Using the
‘tncore_expand’ function of the Tn-Core Toolbox, all reactions absent in the working
reconstruction but present in the S. meliloti genome-scale metabolic reconstruction iGD1575b
(34) were transferred to the working reconstruction. Then, i) all unnecessary ‘source’ reactions
were removed, ii) most metabolic reactions associated with an unknown gene were removed,
and iii) some newly added reactions likely to be incorrect based on published literature were
deleted. Reactions added during the automated expansion sharing a gene in common with an
existing reaction were then manually examined, and in most cases manually removed from the
reconstruction. Then, all reactions producing dead-end metabolites were iteratively removed,
The working reconstruction was next mass and charge balanced. Metabolite formulas
and charges were obtained from the MetaNetX database (47) when available; otherwise,
metabolite charges and formulas were manually prepared, using information from the
PubChem database (48) when available. The ‘checkMassChargeBalance’ function of the
COBRA Toolbox was used to identify mass or charge unbalanced reactions, and reaction
equations were manually balanced. Duplicate reactions were identified and removed.
An ATP hydrolysis reaction was added to account for non-growth associated
maintenance (NGAM) costs (49), using a NGAM cost of 8.39 mmol ATP h-1 (g dry weight)-1
as reported for Escherichia coli (50). A growth associated maintenance (GAM) reaction was
not added as the reconstruction includes transcription and translation reactions. The final
reconstruction, termed iGD1348, contains 1348 genes, 1407 reactions (1164 associated with at
least one gene), and 1160 metabolites (Table S2). The final reconstruction is available in File
S2 in SBML, XLS, and MATLAB COBRA format.
Updating the M. truncatula metabolic network reconstruction.
The published M. truncatula metabolic network reconstruction (40) was built based on the M.
truncatula genome version Mt3.5v5 (51). Here, the gene associations were updated to
correspond to the annotations of version 5.0, the most recent version of the M. truncatula
genome (52). A conversion table was prepared linking the Mt3.5v5 gene names with the
corresponding gene names from the Mt4.0v1 genome annotation (53), which were in turn
associated with the corresponding gene names from the version 5.0 annotation. This conversion
table was prepared based on the information present in i) the ‘Mt3.5Mt4.0v1_conversion_table.txt’ file available on medicagogenome.org (54), and ii) the
‘MtrunA17r5.0-ANR-EGN-r1.6.gene-repeat_region.vs. JCVI-Mt4.0-gene.kgb.synonymy.txt’
file available online at medicago.toulouse.inra.fr/ MtrunA17r5.0-ANR. Next, the published M.
truncatula SBML model was imported into MATLAB with the ‘importMedicago’ function of
Pfau et al. (40). After importing, for genes with a one-to-one match between genome versions,
the existing gene name was replaced with the gene name in the version 5.0 genome annotation.
When multiple genes were combined into a single gene in the version 5.0 annotation, all of the
genes were removed from the model and replaced with the single gene. Genes that were split

into multiple genes in the version 5.0 annotation were replaced with all of the new genes using
an ‘or’ association. Genes with no match in the Mt5.0 genome were removed from the model;
reactions constrained upon removing these genes were also deleted unless they were essential
for model growth (i.e., RXN-9944_H, RXN-7674_H, and PASTOQUINOL-PLASTOCYANIN-REDUCTASE-RXN_H), in which case the corresponding gene also was
not removed.
The majority of transport reactions in the original M. truncatula metabolic
reconstruction, both between the cell and the external environment and between organelles,
were simple diffusion reactions lacking an energy source such as ATP hydrolysis or proton
cotransport. To limit inappropriate transport between compartments, all single-metabolite
diffusion reactions were modified with the exception of metabolites such as water, gases, and
light. All bidirectional reactions were split into two unidirectional reactions, and each reaction
was modified to require the hydrolysis of 0.25 mol of ATP per mol of transported compound.
The modified reconstruction contains 2522 genes, 2920 reactions (1722 associated with at least
one gene), and 2742 metabolites.
The updated M. truncatula reconstruction was used to generate a tissue-specific M.
truncatula model containing shoot and root tissues using the ‘BuildTissueModel’ function of
Pfau et al. (40). Reactions to transfer metabolites between the root and shoot tissue were
modified to require the hydrolysis of 0.25 mol of root ATP and 0.25 mol of shoot ATP per mol
of transferred metabolite. The model was then modified to contain unique gene names for those
associated with the shoot tissue and for those associated with the root tissue, following which
all unused genes were removed from the model. Finally, root import reactions for the following
compounds were added in anticipation of integration with the S. meliloti model: Co2+, MoO43, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, K+, and Na+. The final model encompassed root metabolism and shoot
metabolism with appropriate cross-talk between the tissues (40), and all reactions, metabolites,
and genes associated with the shoot contain the prefix ‘Leave_’, while those associated with
the root contain the prefix ‘Root_’.
Reconstructing the metabolism of a nodulated M. truncatula plant.
The original full (i.e., non-tissue-specific) M. truncatula reconstruction (40) was imported to
MATLAB in COBRA format from SBML format using the ‘readCbModel’ function. The
model was updated to the version 5.0 genome annotations as described in the previously
section, and diffusion reactions were modified to require an energy source as described in the
previous section. The following reactions were then added in preparation for integration with
the S. meliloti model: a homocitrate synthase reaction, a biotin source reaction, a H2 export
reaction, and import reactions for each of N2, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, K+, and Na+. The gene
MtrunA17Chr1g0213481 was associated with the homocitrate synthase reaction based on
homology to the gene of Lotus japonicus (55). At the same time, the S. meliloti model was
modified such that fluxes were recorded in µmol hr-1 (g dry weight)-1, with one µmol of
biomass equalling one g of biomass. This was done to ensure consistency with the units in the
M. truncatula model. The S. meliloti model contained a single gene for all unknown GPRs (i.e.,
‘Unknown’) and a single gene for all spontaneous reactions (i.e., ‘Spontaneous’). In
preparation for constraining the nodule, the ‘Unknown’ and ‘Spontaneous’ genes were replaced
with a series of genes each associated with a single reaction.

The following strategy was adopted to build a multi-compartment metabolic model
accounting for the metabolic interactions of the two organisms. First, we mapped the two
reconstructions to the same name space using the MetaNetX version 3.1 source files (47). This
step was necessary as the S. meliloti model is based on the SEED database (56) and the M.
truncatula model on the MetaCyc database (45). To minimize the required adjustments, only
the metabolite identifiers of metabolites that were both i) a boundary metabolite in the S.
meliloti model and ii) a cytoplasmic compound in the M. truncatula model were changed to
the corresponding MetaNetX code; these represent the pool of metabolites that can be
exchanged between the organisms. A multi-compartment reconstruction was built that included
the M. truncatula model, the S. meliloti model, and transport reactions (without gene
associations) that convert the M. truncatula cytoplasmic compounds to extra-cellular S. meliloti
compounds (e.g., H2O_C => cpd00001[e]). These reactions represent the transport of
compounds across the peribacteroid membrane, between the M. truncatula cytoplasm and the
peribacteroid space of the symbiosome. For each metabolite, two unidirectional transport
reactions were added that each required the hydrolysis of 0.25 mol of plant ATP per mol of the
metabolite of interest. The exception was ammonia; in this case, the transport reaction into the
peribacteroid space was driven by the hydrolysis of 0.25 mol of ATP per mol of ammonia,
while the transport from the peribacteroid space was driven by proton symport (one proton per
one molecule of ammonia). Additionally, protons transferred to the peribacteroid space from
the M. truncatula cytoplasm were separated from protons exported by S. meliloti; no exchange
of protons between S. meliloti and M. truncatula was allowed at this stage.
Four copies of the integrated M. truncatula – S. meliloti model were prepared to
represent four distinct developmental zones of the nodule: zone II distal, zone II proximal,
interzone II-III, and the nitrogen-fixing zone III. Additionally, a version of the M. truncatula
model prior to integration with S. meliloti was included to represent zone I (apical meristem).
In each of the five models, prefixes were added to all reactions, metabolites, and genes to
specify to which zone and which organism the feature belongs (e.g., ‘NoduleIII_’ and
‘BacteroidIII_’). Next, all S. meliloti exchange reactions and all M. truncatula transport
reactions were deleted in each of the five models. The exception was for nodule zone III, where
the import of N2 and export of H2 by M. truncatula were not removed. Finally, a single model
was produced that joined the tissue-specific (root and shoot) M. truncatula model with the five
nodule zone models as a single COBRA formatted metabolic model. To this model, an
irreversible reaction converting protons in the peribacteroid space to S. meliloti periplasmic
protons was added specifically in nodule zone III, thereby allowing the transfer of protons from
M. truncatula to S. meliloti.
At this point, it was necessary to metabolically connect the nodule to the root and to the
external environment. First, for each compound that could be exported by the M. truncatula
root tissue, a reaction was added to each of the five nodule zones for the export of that
compound. Then, for all compounds that could be imported by the M. truncatula root tissue
(except ammonium and nitrate), a diffusion reaction (without an energy requirement) was
added for the import of the metabolite from the external environment to a general nodule
compound. Next, all compounds were identified that could be transferred between the root and
shoot tissues in either direction. For each of these compounds, a diffusion reaction (without an
energy requirement) was added to convert the compound in the root to a general nodule

compound. Then, for each of the general nodule compounds, five irreversible reactions were
added to transfer the general nodule metabolite to each of the nodule zones; each reaction
involved the hydrolysis of 0.25 mol of nodule zone ATP per mol of transported metabolite.
Finally, reactions were added to individually transfer asparagine and glutamine from the M.
truncatula plant cytoplasm of nodule zone III (the nitrogen-fixing zone) to the root tissue, with
each reaction requiring the hydrolysis of 0.25 mol of root ATP and 0.25 mol of nodule zone III
ATP per mol of metabolite.
A series of biomass reactions were added to the combined model. A zone-specific
biomass reaction was added to each of zone II distal, zone II proximal, and interzone II-III by
combining M. truncatula and S. meliloti biomasses at a 75 : 25 ratio. Biomass of zone I
consisted of only M. truncatula biomass. No biomass reaction was added to zone III as the
purpose of this zone was to fix nitrogen. Next, an overall nodule biomass reaction was prepared
by combining zone I, zone II distal, zone II proximal, and interzone IZ biomass at a 5 : 45 : 45
: 5 ratio. A plant biomass reaction was also prepared by combining shoot and root biomass at
a 66.7 : 33.3 ratio. Finally, an overall biomass reaction was prepared that combined plant
biomass with nodule biomass at a 98 : 2 ratio. The overall biomass reaction was set as the
objective function during all FBA simulations unless stated otherwise.
All reactions that produced dead-end metabolites were iteratively removed from the
model, followed by the addition of several constraints into the model (the list of the reactions
removed following this procedure are listed in Dataset S1). Maintenance costs, in the form of
ATP hydrolysis, were added to each tissue including the nitrogen-fixing zone III. The
maintenance cost value for the shoot and root tissues were set as described elsewhere (40).
Maintenance costs for plant nodule tissues were based on the shoot plus root maintenance costs
scaled by the percent of biomass that consisted of the given nodule zone. Similarly, the
maintenance costs of the bacteroid nodule tissues were based on a maximum of 50.4 µmol hr1
(g plant dry weight)-1, scaled according to the percent of biomass that consisted of the given
bacteroid zone (this value was chosen as it equals 30% the commonly used value for free-living
Escherichia coli). Import of ammonium and nitrate by the root and nodule tissues was turned
off, as was usage of starch as a carbon source in the shoot tissue. The uptake of light was set to
1000 µmol hr-1 (g plant dry weight)-1, which is within the range where there is a linear relation
between light and CO2 usage (not shown). The total rate of oxygen usage by the plant and
bacterial cells of nodule zone III was limited to 8.985 µmol hr-1 (g plant dry weight)-1. This
value was arrived at as follows: i) the total oxygen usage of the entire nodule was limited to
12.98 µmol hr-1 (g plant dry weight)-1 based on published experimental data (57), ii) plant
growth was optimized, iii) the O2 usage of zone III was limited to the O2 uptake rate in the
initial analysis, and iv) the constraint on whole nodule O2 usage was removed. To force the use
of C4-dicarboxylates by the bacteroids of zone III, reactions for the import of all other carbon
sources into the symbiosomes were deleted. No constraints were pre-set on the transfer of
nutrients from the plant cytosol to the bacteria of zone II distal, zone II proximal, or interzone
IZ. Finally, the upper and lower bounds of all reactions were multiplied by 1000, converting
the units to nmol hr-1 (g dry weight)-1. This step was necessary to avoid numerical issues when
running GIMME due to low fluxes through the bacteroid reactions.
The reaction space of each nodule zone was constrained based on the M. truncatula –
S. meliloti zone-specific RNA-seq data of Roux and coworkers (58), reanalyzed as described

below, to obtain transcript per million (TPM) values. The expression threshold for a gene to be
considered highly expressed was determined separately for each species, and it was equal to
1.1 times the average TPM value across all nodule zones of all genes that had at least one
mapped read in at least one zone. To limit artificial differences between zones due to the choice
to threshold, Kruskal-Wallis tests, followed by post-hoc comparisons, were performed for each
gene to determine statistically significant between-zone expression changes; this was
performed using the ‘agricolae’ package in R (59). If i) the difference between two zones was
not statistically significant, ii) only one of the two zone had an expression value above the
expression threshold, and iii) the value in the second zone was at least 80% of the expression
threshold, then the value of the second zone was modified to be above the expression threshold.
Moreover, as we wished to only constrain the reaction space of the nodule zones, all shoot and
root genes were given artificial values above the expression threshold in order to ensure they
were considered highly expressed.
The combined model was constrained using a custom multi-species adaptation of the
gene-centric TIGER (60) implementation of the GIMME algorithm (61), which is available in
the Tn-Core Toolbox (23). In short, GIMME was modified to take multiple gene lists (one list
per species), multiple TPM lists (one list per species), and multiple expression thresholds (one
per species). Genes above the respective expression threshold were considered expressed, and
those below the respective threshold were turned off. A score for each ‘off’ gene was calculated
by subtracting the expression value of each gene from the appropriate threshold. The scores for
the species were then normalized based on the ratio of the expression thresholds. The
normalized values of both species were combined as a single list, and the GIMME algorithm
continued as normal. The growth fraction threshold for GIMME was set to 0.99.
The GIMME output was used as the basis to build a constrained and functional
COBRA-formatted model. As the genes identified as ‘on’ following the GIMME analysis were
insufficient to rebuild a working COBRA model, the following pipeline was used. All reactions
active during the GIMME analysis with an absolute flux > 1 x 10-6 nmol hr-1 (g dry weight)-1
were identified. FASTCORE (epsilon of 1.01 x 10-6) was then run using these reactions as the
input core reaction set and the same model used as input for GIMME, but with the lower bound
of the biomass reaction set to 99% of the objective value. A list of protected reactions was
prepared by combining: i) the output reactions of FASTCORE, ii) all reactions that were not
constrained when the genes identified as ‘off’ in the GIMME analysis were deleted from the
input model, iii) all peribacteroid transport reactions, and iv) all reactions for the transfer of
metabolites between tissues. All nodule or bacteroid reactions that were not part of this
protected list were removed from the model, and all genes no longer associated with a reaction
were deleted. The genes associated with each reaction were then refined based on the GIMME
output. For any given reaction, no change was made if all the associated genes were classified
as ‘on’, or if all genes were linked with ‘and’ statements. Otherwise, for reactions with ‘or’
statements, but lacking ‘and’ statements, all genes classified as ‘off’ were removed from the
reaction; if no gene was classified as ‘on’, then all genes were deleted except for the gene with
the highest expression value. For reactions with both ‘or’ and ‘and’ statements, a complex loop
was prepared. Put briefly, a minimal set of genes required for the reaction to be functional was
left associated with the reaction, favouring the inclusion of ‘on’ genes followed by the inclusion
of highly expressed ‘off’ genes. All reactions producing dead-end metabolites were iteratively

Finally, all reaction and metabolite identifiers were updated to MetaNetX codes, where
possible, to maximize consistency throughout the model, and duplicate reactions were deleted.
We refer to this final version of the integrated model as ViNE (for Virtual Nodule
Environment), and it is provided in File S3 as MATLAB COBRA and SBML formatted files.
The unconstrained model of the nodulated plant is also provided in File S3.
Adding sucrose metabolism to zone III bacteroids in ViNE.
To perform simulations comparing the use of sucrose and C4-dicarboxylates as a carbon source
for zone III bacteroids, ViNE was modified as follows. The pipeline for construction of ViNE
as detailed above was rerun with a single change. Prior to running GIMME, reactions for the
import of all carbon sources, except sucrose, into the symbiosomes were deleted. This is in
contrast to the construction of the regular version of ViNE, when the reactions for the import
of all carbon sources, except C4-dicarboxlates, into the symbiosomes were deleted. The
resulting model was then combined with ViNE, producing in an enlarged version of ViNE
supplemented with the necessary reactions to allow sucrose to serve as a carbon source for zone
III bacteroids.
Analysis of the RNA-sequencing data.
The nodule zones in the integrated metabolic model were constrained based on previously
published RNA-seq data (58); however, the data were first re-analyzed using the M. truncatula
version 5 genome sequence and annotations. The raw sequencing reads (fastq format; SRA
accession SRP028599) were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive database
(62), and all files corresponding to the same replicate of the same zone were concatenated as a
single file, keeping separate files for each mate pair. The M. truncatula A17 genome (version
5.0) and the S. meliloti Rm2011 genome were downloaded and combined as a single file. The
combined genome was indexed using the bowtie2-build function with default settings (63).
Sequencing reads were mapped to the genome with bowtie2 version 2.2.3 (63), treating reads
as paired-ends and using 20 threads. Output SAM files were sorted by name with samtools sort
version 1.3.1-39-ga9054c7 (64) using 20 threads. Reads per gene were counted using HTseqcount version 0.6.1p1 (65), with the default alignment score threshold of 10. Each HTseq-count
output table was split into two tables: one for M. truncatula and one for S. meliloti. TPM values
were calculated for each species-specific output file using a custom Perl script, based on the
total gene length for the S. meliloti genes and the total exon length for the M. truncatula genes.
Finally, zone-specific average TPM values based the three biological replicates of each zone
were calculated. These values were used to constrain the reaction space of the nodule zones in
the integrated metabolic model.
Metabolic modelling procedures
Model integration, model manipulations, and FBA simulations were performed in MATLAB
R2016b (mathworks.com) using the SBMLToolbox version 4.1.0 (66), libSBML version
5.13.0 (67), and scripts from the COBRA Toolbox commit 9b10fa1 (68), the TIGER Toolbox
version 1.2.0-beta (60), FASTCORE version 1.0 (69), and the Tn-Core Toolbox version 2.2

simulations; the exception was for preparation of iGD1348, during which the Gurobi version
7.0.1 solver (gurobi.com) was used. The switch to CPLEX was prompted by numerical issues
that were solved by switching solver. All custom scripts used in this study are available through
a GitHub repository (github.com/diCenzo-GC/ViNE_Reconstruction).
Each gene found in multiple tissues or nodule zones was distinguished by a unique gene
name to facilitate tissue-specific gene deletion analysis. When performing global single or
double gene deletion analyses, all versions of the gene were simultaneously deleted followed
by the removal of all constrained reactions. In contrast, zone- or tissue-specific gene deletion
analyses involved deleting just the gene version specific to the zone or tissue of interest. Flux
variability was performed with the requirement that flux through the objective function was at
least 99% the optimal flux. The robustness analysis involved first identifying the approximate
flux range for each reaction in which the plant growth rate was non-zero. Then, for each
reaction, the flux rate of the reaction was set to various values within the previously identified
flux range, and the objective value was maximized. For simulations in which the rate of
nodulation could vary, nodule biomass was removed from the objective reaction and instead
forced through a nodule biomass sink reaction at the appropriate rate; maintenance costs and
oxygen availability were modified accordingly (see Text S1). For simulations comparing the
effect of providing zone III bacteroids sucrose versus C4-dicarboxylates as the carbon source,
a modified version of ViNE was prepared as described in the subsection “Adding sucrose
metabolism to zone III bacteroids in ViNE”.
RESULTS
Validation of iGD1348, an updated S. meliloti metabolic reconstruction.
Prior to constructing the integrated plant – bacterium metabolic model, an updated metabolic
reconstruction of S. meliloti Rm1021 was prepared as described in the Materials and Methods.
Briefly, the highly refined core metabolic network iGD726 (34) was combined with the
comprehensive accessory metabolism of the genome-scale metabolic network iGD1575 (33).
Most of the reactions were compared against the literature, referenced where possible, and
mass and charge balanced. The updated model consists of 1348 genes (Table S2), and
incorporates information from 240 literature sources (listed in the Excel file of File S1) that
include published transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq) data (34) and Phenotype MicroArray data
(33, 71, 72) for wild-type and mutant strains.
Several tests were performed to validate the quality of the newly prepared S. meliloti
reconstruction. Flux balance analysis (FBA) was used to simulate growth using glucose or
succinate as the sole source of carbon, with or without the inclusion of an NGAM reaction.
Inclusion of an NGAM reaction resulted in a specific growth rate reduction of ~ 0.043 h-1 and
0.030 h-1 for growth with glucose and succinate, respectively. This result confirmed the absence
of energy leaks in iGD1348 that would allow for spontaneous energy production.
Using FBA, the ability of S. meliloti to catabolize 163 carbon sources to support growth
was predicted with the iGD1348 and iGD1575 models (Dataset S2). As previously reported
(33), simulations with the iGD1575 model correctly predicted growth with 67 of the 85 (79%)
substrates experimentally shown to support growth of S. meliloti. Nicely, simulations with the
iGD1348 model correctly predicted growth with 76 of these 85 (89%) substrates, including all
67 that supported growth of the iGD1575 model. This result confirmed that iGD1348

incorporates the majority of the accessory metabolism of S. meliloti, and that it is a better
representation of total cellular S. meliloti metabolism than the previous genome-scale model.
Context-specific core metabolic models were extracted from the iGD1348 and
iGD1575 metabolic models through the integration of transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq) data
(34) using Tn-Core (29). The accuracy of the resulting core metabolic models was determined
through comparison with iGD726, a manually prepared core metabolic model of S. meliloti
(34). As summarized in Figure 1, the iGD1348 core model displayed greater overlap with the
iGD726 model than did the iGD1575 core model. In particular, of the essential genes in the
iGD726 model, 96% were essential in the iGD1348 core model, whereas only 62% were
essential in the iGD1575 core model (Figure 1B). This result confirmed that the newly prepared
iGD1348 reconstruction better represents the core metabolic network of S. meliloti than does
the iGD1575 reconstruction. Overall, these tests confirmed that iGD1348 is a high-quality
representation of S. meliloti metabolism, and that it better represents both the core and
accessory metabolic properties of S. meliloti strain Rm1021 than does the original iGD1575
model.

models of iGD1575 and iGD1348 were prepared using Tn-Core and published Tn-seq data(34).

Construction and validation of a metabolic model of a nodulated legume.
As a prerequisite to generating an in silico genome-scale metabolic network of an entire
nodulated legume (referred to as ViNE for Virtual Nodule Environment), it was necessary to
obtain high-quality reconstructions of M. truncatula and S. meliloti metabolism. In the case of
M. truncatula, we used a recently published reconstruction that was updated to match the most
recent version of the M. truncatula genome annotation (see Materials and Methods). For S.
meliloti, we made use of the newly updated model described in the previous section and the
Materials and Methods.

Integrating the S. meliloti and M. truncatula metabolic models resulted in a model
encompassing shoot, root, and nodule tissues as summarized in Figure 2 and Table 1. In total,
this model includes 746 unique S. meliloti genes and 1,327 unique M. truncatula genes. Several
simulations were performed to evaluate the reliability of the model. Using FBA, the maximal
rate of plant (shoot + root) growth of the nodulated system was predicted to be ~ 0.044 g day1
(g plant dry weight)-1, which is a reasonable prediction; Medicago sativa plants have an
experimentally determined growth rate of ~ 0.1 g day-1 (g plant dry weight)-1 (73).

Next, FBA was used to examine the effects of adding exogenous ammonium to the soil on
plant growth considering two situations: i) the rate of N2-fixation could vary while the rate of
nodulation was constant, and ii) the rate of nodulation could vary while the rate of N2-fixation
per gram of nodule was constant. As expected, increasing the availability of exogenous
ammonium increased the rate of plant growth, with the effect more pronounced when
nodulation was allowed to decrease with increasing ammonium since the plant no longer had
to invest in nodule maintenance (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Effect of exogenous ammonium on M. truncatula growth. The effects of
increasing the availability of soil ammonium on the growth rate of nodulated M. truncatula
was examined. Simulations were run allowing either the rate of N2-fixation to vary while
nodulation remained constant (blue) or allowing the rate of nodulation to vary while the rate of
N2-fixation per gram nodule remained constant (red). The dashed lines indicate the maximal
rate of plant growth with exogenous ammonium (upper) and the maximal rate of plant growth
when relying on N2-fixation (lower).

We then simulated the effects of individual bacteria gene deletion on plant biomass
production (Dataset S3) and compared the results to published experimental data. The model
was able to accurately predict the phenotypes of many S. meliloti mutants. For example, S.
meliloti genes such as nifH (nitrogenase), dctA (succinate transport), ilvI (branched chain amino
acid biosynthesis), aatA (aspartate transaminase), pgk (phosphoglycerate kinase), and nrdJ
(ribonucleotide reductase) were correctly predicted to be essential, while pyc (pyruvate
carboxylase), glnA (glutamine synthetase), pckA (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), and
leuB (leucine biosynthesis) were correctly predicted to be non-essential (74-81). Similarly, the
removal of plant-encoded nodule sucrose synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and
homocitrate synthase reactions abolished nitrogen fixation, as expected (55, 82, 83). However,
it is important to note that the predictions were not perfect. For example, deleting argG
(arginine biosynthesis) or carA (carbamoyl phosphate synthase) did not result in the expected
phenotypes, while the incorrect malic enzyme (tme instead of dme) was predicted to be
essential (84-86). Taken together, these analyses provide support for the general reliability of
ViNE as a representation of nodule metabolism.

Metabolic progression and nutrient exchange during nodule development
The presence of five nodule zones in ViNE provided an opportunity to examine the metabolic
changes associated with the development of an effective nodule. To accomplish this, FBA was
used to predict the flux distribution through the integrated metabolic networks of each nodule
zone, and to simulate the effects of individually deleting each gene, or removing each reaction,
specifically in a single nodule zone. Additionally, a robustness analysis was performed to
evaluate how perturbations in the flux of individual bacteroid reactions influence the predicted
rate of plant growth. The outputs of these analyses are provided as Datasets S4 and S5 and
summarized in Figures S1 and S2. For simplicity, here we focus on the reaction-level analyses,
and we split the nodule into only three sections: uninfected (zone I), differentiating (zones IId,
IIp, and IZ), and nitrogen-fixing (zone III) (Figure 4). Highlighting the overall similarity of
zones IId, IIp, and IZ, and thus supporting their grouping, the robustness analysis indicated that
roughly 90% of the bacteroid reactions that had to carry flux in one of these zones had to carry
flux in all three zones to maximize plant growth.

bacteroids may place additional energy demands on the plant cell, and that few additional
metabolic functions are required. In contrast, the transition from the differentiation zone to the
nitrogen fixing zone was associated with a marked decrease in the number of active reactions
in both the plant and bacterial cells, consistent with published transcriptomic and proteomic
datasets (58, 87-89). Highlighting this result, ~ 560 bacteroid reactions had to carry flux in the
differentiation zones to optimize plant growth, whereas only 167 bacteroid reactions had to
carry flux in the N2-fixation zone for maximal plant growth.
The lack of biomass production in the N2-fixation zone meant that most biomass
biosynthetic pathways were predicted to be inactive and non-essential. However, bacterial
pathways related to the production of cofactors for nitrogenase or energy production remained
essential; this included FMN, heme, cobalamin, pyridoxine phosphate, and glutathione
biosynthesis, as well as the pentose phosphate pathway. Similarly, the TCA cycle, oxidative
phosphorylation, and purine biosynthesis in bacteroids were predicted to be essential in the N2fixation zone, presumably to supply the massive amounts of energy required by nitrogenase.
Biosynthesis of methionine and SAM were also predicted to be essential. Few other notable
bacterial reactions were required in the N2-fixation zone (Dataset S4). In the plant
compartment, the majority of the active reactions were related to central carbon metabolism
for the production of energy and C4-dicarboxylates for use by the bacteroids, while other active
reactions were involved in the assimilation of ammonium through the formation of glutamine.
Consistent with experimental works [reviewed by (18, 90)], the FBA results indicated that the
plant nodule cells were provided sucrose as a carbon/energy source; in fact, ~ 30% of all carbon
fixed by the plant leaves was sent to nodule zone III. The sucrose was then hydrolyzed and
metabolized to phosphoenolpyruvate, of which ~ 80% was diverted to oxaloacetate through a
cytoplasmic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction for use in the production of C4dicarboxylates.
Next, nutrient exchange between the plant and bacterial partners was examined. While
the prevailing evidence suggests C4-dicarboxlyates (succinate, malate, fumarate) are the
primary carbon source for N2-fixing bacteroids (18, 91-93), the source of carbon for
differentiating bacteroids has not been established. The FBA results suggested that
differentiating bacteroids primarily use sugars, likely sucrose, as a carbon source. This is
consistent with micrographic evidence suggesting that bacterial mutants unable to use C4dicarboxylates can undergo at least partial differentiation (91, 92). Currently, it is commonly
accepted that nitrogen is primarily exported from bacteroids as ammonia (94, 95); however,
some studies have suggested that L-alanine could be a major nitrogen export product (96, 97).
Here, the FBA simulations were consistent with ammonia being the primary export product in
the S. meliloti – M. truncatula symbiosis. However, prior to constraining the nodule reaction
space, reducing the availability of oxygen to the bacteroids resulted in a shift in the nitrogen
export product from ammonia to L-alanine. Thus, the detection of L-alanine versus ammonia
as an export product could be due, in part, to differences in experimental set-up that may
influence oxygen availability to the bacteroid. Also, experimental data suggest that rhizobial
biosynthesis of some amino acids are essential for the symbiosis while the biosynthesis of
others are not, and that the phenotypes may be symbiosis-specific [reviewed by (98)].
Similarly, our FBA simulations suggested that rhizobial biosynthesis of approximately half of
the amino acids was essential for the symbiosis.

Sociobiology of symbiotic nitrogen fixation
By containing a representation of an entire nodule, ViNE allowed for an evaluation of the
metabolic costs associated with SNF. Using FBA, the maximal plant growth rate of the
nodulated system (without exogenous ammonium) was estimated to be ~ 72% of the maximal
growth rate of a nodule-free system supplied with non-limiting amounts of exogenous
ammonium (Figure 3, Table 2). The largest factor contributing to the difference in growth was
the direct energetic cost of supporting N2-fixation (~ 67% of the difference; Table 2). The
remaining third of the difference was explained by the cost of synthesizing (~ 11% of the
difference) and maintaining (~ 22% of the difference) the nodule and bacteroid tissue (Table
2).

We next evaluated the relationship between the rate of N2-fixation (without modifying
the plant to nodule ratio) and the rate of plant growth. When the rate of N2-fixation was below
the optimum, there was a linear relationship between N2-fixation and biomass production
(Figure 5A). However, excessive N2-fixation quickly resulted in impaired plant growth, with a
10% excess of N2-fixation collapsing the symbiosis (Figure 5A). We hypothesized that this
result was due to insufficient energy to support both the excess N2-fixation and the ATP
maintenance costs. Consistent with this hypothesis, removing the upper limit on the rate of
zone III oxygen uptake resulted in a gradual decrease in plant growth as the rate of N2-fixation
was increased above the optimal (Figure 5A). In this case, excessive N2-fixation was less
detrimental than insufficient N2-fixation; the effect of increasing the rate of N2-fixation by 1
µmol hr-1 (g plant dry weight)-1 increased or decreased the rate of plant growth by 14.7 or 3.4
mg day-1 (g plant dry weight)-1 when below or above the optimum, respectively. We next
examined the consequences of varying the rate of nodulation (i.e., the ratio between plant and
nodule biomass) while maintaining a constant rate of N2-fixation per gram of nodule. The
simulations demonstrated linear relationships between the rate of nodulation and plant growth
both above and below the optimum (Figure 5B), with increasing the percent nodulation
resulting in a 3-fold greater impact when below the optimum compared to above the optimum.
Overall, these simulations suggest that a slightly too efficient symbiosis is preferable (for plant
biomass production) over a slightly inefficient symbiosis, unless the required rate of O2 usage
exceeds the nodule oxygen diffusion limit.

frontiers showing the relationship between the rate of N2-fixation (with a constant ratio between

The effect of N2-fixation efficiency (rate of N2-fixation per gram nodule) on the rate of plant
growth, with the amount of nodule biomass optimized to maximize plant growth and without
a limit on zone III oxygen uptake (see Figure S3 for simulations with an oxygen uptake limit).
Nodule biomass was either uncapped (red) or limited to 10% (blue) or 5% (purple) of the
overall biomass.

The previous simulations represented simple scenarios where only a single variable
differed. In reality, a change in the efficiency of N2-fixation should be accompanied by a
change in the extent of nodulation as a result of legume autoregulation of nodulation (99). We
therefore ran simulations where the efficiency of N2-fixation (i.e., the rate of N2-fixation per
gram of nodule) was varied and the amount of nodule biomass was optimized to maximize
plant growth. Strikingly, the simulations suggested a pattern of diminishing returns associated
with increasing the efficiency of N2-fixation (Figures 5C and S3); decreasing N2-fixation
efficiency 50% from the maximum tested value resulted in a mere 10% decrease in plant
growth. The half maximal growth rate was achieved with a N2-fixation efficiency of just 10%

the maximal, although this required that the nodule accounted for almost 13% of the total
biomass. If we assume an upper limit of nodulation at 10% or 5% of the total biomass, the
benefits of low rates of N2-fixation are decreased although the pattern of diminishing returns
remains (Figures 5C and S3). In these cases, half maximal plant growth rate is achieved at 12%
or 21%, respectively, of the highest tested N2-fixation efficiency. Overall, these simulations
support that even a poor symbiosis is likely to provide a noticeable benefit to the plant.
Influence of protons and O2 on the carbon source provided to N2-fixing bacteroids
It is well-established that C4-dicarboxylates (malate, succinate, fumarate) are the primary
carbon source provided to nitrogen-fixing zone III bacteroids (18, 91-93); however, the reason
for this remains unclear. We therefore attempted to uncover a metabolic explanation using
ViNE. Surprisingly, preliminary FBA simulations with the ViNE precursor model (i.e., prior
to constraining the reaction space) suggested that the N2-fixing bacteroids of zone III use
sucrose, not C4-dicarboxylates, as the primary carbon source. Unexpectedly, forcing the use of
C4-dicarboxylates resulted in the model being unable to fix nitrogen or produce plant biomass.
During those simulations, protons of the plant cytosol could be transferred to the peribacteroid
space but were not allowed to be used by the N2-fixing bacteroids. However, this may not be
realistic since the peribacteroid space of N2-fixing bacteroids is acidic due to import of protons
from the plant cytosol (100-102). If the analysis was repeated and the zone III bacteroids were
provided access to the protons of the peribacteroid space, it became possible for C4dicarboxylates to serve as the primary carbon source and support N2-fixation and plant growth.
These results suggest that the plant-driven acidification of the peribacteroid space is essential
for the metabolic functioning of the bacteroid.
Although the transfer of protons to the periplasm allowed C4-dicarboxylates to support
N2-fixation, the rate of plant biomass production nevertheless remained higher when the N2fixing bacteroids were provided sucrose instead of C4-dicarboxylates. To further investigate
this difference, ViNE was modified to contain reactions for the transport and metabolism of
sucrose by N2-fixing bacteroids (see Materials and Methods). Consistent with results from the
precursor model, FBA simulations suggested the ability of bacteroids to use sucrose (plus C4dicarboxylates) increased plant growth rate by 6.4% relative to when bacteroids were supplied
only C4-dicarboxylates. ViNE contains a limit on the rate of oxygen uptake by zone III nodule
tissue, restricting nodule and bacteroid metabolism. We wondered whether the use of sucrose
versus C4-dicarboxylates may be modulated by the free oxygen concentration of the nodule.
The concentration of free oxygen in the N2-fixation zone has been experimentally demonstrated
to be < 50 nM (103). Notably, the Km values of the mitochondrial and bacterial terminal
oxidases towards oxygen are 50-100 nM (104, 105) and 7 nM (106), respectively. These
enzyme kinetics suggest that the metabolism of the plant fraction, but not the bacteroid fraction,
of the nodule is likely to be oxygen limited (107, 108), a conclusion that is supported by
measurements of nodule adenylate pools (109). Therefore, we ran a series of simulations in
which the upper limit of the mitochondrial terminal oxidase reaction of zone III was varied,
with no overall limit on the use of oxygen by the nodule. Gradually reducing the flux through
the mitochondrial terminal oxidase was associated with a gradual replacement of sucrose with
C4-dicarboxylates as the bacteroid carbon source (Figure 6). This result is consistent with the
hypothesis that the low free oxygen concentration of the N2-fixation zone could be a

contributing factor to why bacteroids are provided C4-dicarboxylates, and not sugars, as the
primary carbon source.
Assuming the nodule (consisting primarily of zone III tissue) accounts for 2% of total
plant biomass, and that bacteroid biomass accounts for 25% of nodule biomass, the maximal
rate of predicted C4-dicarboxylate import by N2-fixing bacteroids (1.3 mmol hr-1 [g bacteroid
dry weight]-1) was similar to experimentally determined uptake rates by S. meliloti bacteroids
(1.1 to 1.3 mmol hr-1 [g bacteroid dry weight]-1) (35, 110). Considered together, these
simulations provide evidence that C4-dicarboxylates can support optimal plant growth under
physiologically-relevant conditions.

DISCUSSION
Models of the integrated metabolism of various holobionts (consisting of a host and its
symbiotic microorganisms) would be valuable tools to understand the emergent properties of
these systems (111, 112). However, to date there are few examples of constraint-based
metabolic modelling being used to study metabolic interactions [e.g., (8, 31)], with this
approach most commonly used to study the human gut microbiome (113). Here, we developed
a broadly adaptable pipeline for modelling the metabolism of interacting organisms across
physiologically distinct tissue (sub)sections. Using metabolic network reconstruction and
constraint-based modelling, we studied the metabolism of a legume root nodule and SNF, a
well-established model of inter-organismal metabolic exchange and cellular differentiation.
Our model (ViNE) accounts for plant shoot, root, and nodule tissues, with the nodule
encompassing the metabolism of both the plant and bacterial partners and subdivided into five
developmental zones. This is an advance over previous attempts at modelling SNF (33, 35-40),
most of which focused solely on bacterial metabolism while treating the plant as a black box.
The increased complexity of ViNE allows for more accurate simulations of the nutrient
exchange, analysis of the metabolic differentiation associated with nodule development,
examination of unexpected emergent properties of the symbiosis resulting from inter-organism
interactions, and for the possibility to perturb the network at the single reactions level. Initial
simulations with ViNE supported that this model does a good job at capturing the metabolism
of a legume nodule. Nevertheless, as with all models, ViNE predictions were imperfect.
However, as we often compared simulated phenotypes for M. truncatula with experimental
data for M. sativa, and given that rhizobium mutant phenotypes are often plant specific [e.g.,
(114-116)], we cannot rule out that some of the inconsistencies are the result of plant-specific
phenotypes. Going forward, we intend to continue to manually refine and update ViNE to
maximize consistency with experimental observations.
FBA simulations with ViNE revealed a pattern of diminishing returns in terms of plant
growth (as a proxy for fitness) as the efficiency of the symbiosis (rate of N2-fixation per gram
of nodule) increased, assuming that the amount of nodule biomass per plant could vary (Figure
5C). This observation has potential implications for engineering SNF for biotechnological
applications. It suggests that when developing rhizobial inoculants, maximizing competition
for nodule occupancy may have a greater impact than maximizing the rate of N2-fixation. This
result also supports efforts aimed at engineering N2-fixing symbiosis with cereals (117) by
highlighting how even a low efficiency symbiosis has the potential to have a noticeable benefit
on crop yield.
At the same time, the pattern of diminishing returns is interesting from an evolutionary
perspective (118). In particular, the evolution of N2-fixation efficiency may be influenced by
the rhizobium community diversity, assuming that nodule infection increases the fitness of
rhizobia (119). In an environment dominated by a single rhizobium, kin selection may favour
the evolution of a poorly efficient symbiosis as it would increase nodule number and thus the
size of the niche for colonization by the rhizobia. On the other hand, in a highly diverse
environment, evolution of strains capable of entering into a highly efficient symbiosis may be
favoured, as this would lead to fewer nodules and thus less plant resources being allocated to
competing rhizobium strains, thereby limiting the spread of less mutualist (viz. cheater) strains
(20, 120).

Of particular interest to us was the metabolic exchange between the plant and rhizobia,
both during N2-fixation and during differentiation. The carbon source(s) of differentiating
rhizobia remain poorly understood. Results with ViNE suggested that sucrose may be a major
carbon source for the differentiating bacteroids. However, S. meliloti mutants unable to
transport sucrose are not impaired in nodule formation (121), suggesting that differentiating
bacteroids have access to at least one other carbon source. Interestingly, a S. meliloti pyc mutant
unable to grow with glycolytic carbon sources was not impaired in differentiation (80).
Similarly, S. meliloti pckA (78) and tpi (122) mutants unable to grow with gluconeogenic
carbon sources remained capable of differentiating. Thus, it seems likely that differentiating
bacteroids have access to a variety of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon substrate, with
sugars possibly serving as the main carbon source in wild type nodules. If so, the restriction of
carbon flow to N2-fixing bacteroids to just C4-dicarboxylates may be the result of active
remodelling of the peribacteroid membrane during differentiation.
In attempting to identify conditions favouring the use of C4-dicarboxylates as a carbon
source by N2-fixing bacteroids, ViNE also provided insights into the metabolic exchange in the
N2-fixation zone. The peribacteroid space of N2-fixing bacteroids is known to be acidic due to
the activity of H+-ATPases on the peribacteroid membrane (100-102). This acidification
contributes to the import of C4-dicarboxylates and the export of ammonium from/to the plant
cytosol and the peribacteroid space (123), and it may contribute to the lysis of non-functional
symbiosomes (124). Our FBA simulations suggest that the plant-derived protons of the
peribacteroid space may also be actively used by the bacteroid to support its metabolism.
Although it is generally accepted that nodules are low oxygen environments (103), the
site of O2-limitation has been debated. Based on the average concentration of free oxygen in
the nodule, enzyme kinetics data are consistent with the mitochondria being O2-limited and the
bacteroids being O2-sufficient (103-106). Measurements of the adenylate pools of the plant and
bacterial nodule fractions support this conclusion (109). However, others have argued that
nodule adenylate measurements suggest that bacteroids, not the plant, are O2-limited (125).
Similarly, it was suggested that mitochondria cluster near the periphery of the cell near air
pockets, resulting in elevated local O2 concentrations (126, 127). The FBA results presented
here predicted that C4-dicarboxylates are the optimal carbon source for N2-fixing bacteroids
only when the plant mitochondria are O2-limited while the bacteroids are O2-sufficient (Figure
6). This result supports the hypothesis that mitochondria, and not bacteroids, are O2-limited in
wild type nodules.
In sum, this work presented a complex metabolic model representing the full
metabolism of a rhizobium-nodulated legume, as well as a series of simulations demonstrating
the potential for this model to help address genetic, evolutionary, metabolic, and
sociobiological questions. Future work will be aimed at continuing to refine and improve the
quality of the model, and to using the model to generate hypotheses to guide experimental
studies and to assist in the interpretation of experimental datasets.
