Abstract

17

Understanding the origin of new species is a central goal in evolutionary biology. Diverging

18

lineages often evolve highly heterogeneous patterns of differentiation; however, the

19

underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We used an integrated approach to

20

investigate evolutionary processes governing genetic differentiation between the hybridizing

21

campions (Silene dioica (L.) Clairv. and S. latifolia Poiret). Demographic modeling indicated

22

that the two species diverged with continuous gene flow. The best-supported scenario with

23

heterogeneity in both migration rate and effective population size suggested that 5% of the

24

loci evolved without gene flow. Differentiation (FST) and sequence divergence (dXY) were

25

correlated and both tended to peak in the middle of most linkage groups, consistent with

26

reduced gene flow at highly differentiated loci. Highly differentiated loci further exhibited

27

signatures of selection and differentiation was significantly elevated around previously

28

identified QTLs associated with assortative mating. In between-species population pairs,

29

isolation by distance was stronger for genomic regions with low between-species

30

differentiation than for highly differentiated regions that may contain barrier loci. Moreover,

31

differentiation landscapes within and between species were only weakly correlated suggesting

32

that the interplay of background selection and conserved genomic features is not the dominant

33

determinant of genetic differentiation in these lineages. Instead, our results suggest that

Introduction

40

Understanding the origin of new species is a central goal in evolutionary biology. Genetic

41

differentiation between diverging lineages often is highly heterogeneous throughout the

42

genome; however, the underlying causes are much debated (Ravinet et al., 2017; Wolf &

43

Ellegren, 2017) and empirical studies are still scarce, particularly for intermediate stages of

44

speciation. One important determinant of the evolutionary processes at work is the

45

demographic history of lineage divergence (Ravinet et al., 2017). When geographic barriers

46

prevent gene flow, drift and adaptation can proceed independently in each lineage. Under this

47

scenario, high differentiation may commonly arise in regions of low recombination, through

48

the ubiquitous process of background selection (Burri, 2017; Burri et al., 2015; Nachman &

49

Payseur, 2012). Under a contrasting scenario, speciation occurs with ongoing gene flow.

50

Here, regions of high differentiation may arise because of reduced gene flow at barrier loci

51

whereas the remainder of the genome is homogenized by gene flow. Theoretical studies

52

indicate that divergence with gene flow is most likely when loci controlling reproductive

53

barriers are clustered in the genome or situated in regions of low recombination (Butlin &

54

Smadja, 2018; Yeaman, Aeschbacher, & Bürger, 2016). A third common scenario combines

55

divergence in allopatry with gene flow upon secondary contact. In this case, gene flow erodes

56

differentiation at loci unlinked to adaptive differentiation or reproductive isolation. This

57

situation may also prompt the evolution of further reproductive barriers (reinforcement) when

58

intermediate hybrids are selected against (Butlin & Smadja, 2018). More complex scenarios,

59

including effects of changes in population size and recurrent bouts of gene flow may be also

60

supported (Christe et al., 2017). Divergent selection, background selection and gene flow

61

leave distinct population genomic signatures (see below); however, it is clear that realistic

62

demographic scenarios are a pre-requisite to interpret the genomic landscape of

63

differentiation.

64

Despite the strong evidence for variation in gene flow throughout the genome and pervasive

65

effects of background selection and conserved genomic features, such as recombination rate

66

variation, mutation rate and gene density, on genetic differentiation (Ravinet et al., 2017;

67

Wolf & Ellegren, 2017), demographic models have only just begun to incorporate these

68

heterogeneities (Christe et al., 2017; Rougemont & Bernatchez, 2018; Roux et al., 2014;

69

Roux et al., 2016; Tine et al., 2014). Models based on diffusion approximation (Gutenkunst,

70

Hernandez, Williamson, & Bustamante, 2009) or on approximate Bayesian computation

71

(Roux et al., 2016) of the joint site frequency spectrum can explicitly include heterogeneous

72

migration rates. Heterogeneities in conserved genomic features and thus background

73

selection, on the other hand, can be modeled by allowing effective population size, Ne, to vary

74

among loci (Charlesworth, 2009; Roux et al., 2016). Including heterogeneity in migration rate

75

and Ne in demographic models often improves model fit and can affect inferences on the best-

76

supported model as well as demographic estimates, such as divergence time (Rougemont &

77

Bernatchez, 2018; Roux et al., 2016). Interestingly, support for heterogeneous migration rates

78

in demographic models was strongest in taxon pairs at intermediate stages of speciation,

79

species, in the so-called "grey zone" of speciation (Roux et al., 2016). This finding aligns with

80

empirical results on the genomic landscape of differentiation, reviewed in Ravinet et al.

81

(2017) and Wolf and Ellegren (2017). At later stages of speciation, gene flow may rapidly

82

cease leading to a genome-wide rise of differentiation (Flaxman, Wacholder, Feder, & Nosil,

83

2014). The evolution of heterogeneous genetic differentiation is key to understanding the

84

speciation process and it therefore is most promising to target taxa that have considerable

85

reproductive isolation but are still hybridizing.

86

Population genomic signals of gene flow, divergent selection, and background selection on

87

the genomic landscape of differentiation have been the subject of recent research (Burri,

88

2017; Cruickshank & Hahn, 2014; Ravinet et al., 2017; Wolf & Ellegren, 2017). Genetic

89

differentiation is commonly measured using Wright´s fixation index, FST, which is sensitive

90

not only to changes in gene flow, but also to alterations of genetic diversity within lineages

91

(Burri, 2017; Cruickshank & Hahn, 2014; Wolf & Ellegren, 2017). Sequence divergence,

92

often measured as dXY, in contrast, is expected to increase primarily due to reductions in gene

93

flow (barrier loci) or as a result of lineage sorting in ancestral populations (Nachman &

94

Payseur, 2012; Richards, Servedio, & Martin, 2019). Joint increases in dXY and FST are

95

therefore expected at barrier loci but not at loci with high differentiation due to background

96

selection (Cruickshank & Hahn, 2014; Nachman & Payseur, 2012). Several studies have

97

further inferred an important role of divergent selection in the generation of highly

98

differentiated loci by testing for reductions in sequence diversity and for an excess of rare

99

variants (Nielsen, 2005), for example, in three-spined sticklebacks (Feulner et al., 2015;

100

Marques et al., 2017; Samuk et al., 2017), cichlids (Malinsky et al., 2015; Meier, Marques,

101

Wagner, Excoffier, & Seehausen, 2018) and poplars (Wang, Street, Scofield, & Ingvarsson,

102

2016). Moreover, admixture analyses and analyses of multiple population pairs in different

103

geographic contexts have identified genomic regions with reduced gene flow, as in sea bass

104

(Duranton et al., 2018) and Darwin´s finches (Han et al., 2017). Thus, even though many of

105

these approaches remain challenging, the combined use of different population genomic

106

estimates and analyses helps to elucidate processes affecting genetic differentiation.

107

Ideally, speciation genomic studies relate to well-investigated reproductive barriers and the

108

genes controlling them. The nature, strength and genetic architecture of reproductive barriers

109

determine the course and completion of the speciation process (Flaxman et al., 2014). Some

110

speciation events appear to be based on few traits controlled be a small number of genomic

111

regions, for example in crows (Poelstra et al., 2014). In many other systems, in contrast,

112

speciation can proceed through multiple reproductive barriers, including adaptive

113

differentiation, assortative mating, and intrinsic barriers, which may be associated with a large

114

number of traits and/or complex genetic architectures (reviewed in Wolf & Ellegren, 2017).

115

In cases involving many loci of small effect, it may be difficult or impossible to identify the

116

genes underlying reproductive isolation. This is because the genetic architecture of

117

reproductive isolation may be transient and the effect of individual loci may be too small to

118

be detected (Rockman, 2012; Yeaman, 2015). Nonetheless, integrating the ecology and

119

genetic control of reproductive barriers with population genomic analyses is necessary to

120

understand the speciation process.

121

We investigated the closely related campions, Silene dioica (L.) Clairv. and S. latifolia Poiret

122

(Caryophyllaceae), a plant system with ongoing hybridization but near-complete reproductive

123

isolation (reproductive isolation index, RItotal > 0.98) (Karrenberg & Favre, 2008; Karrenberg

124

et al., 2019; Minder, Rothenbuehler, & Widmer, 2007). The two species have separates sexes

125

with XY sex determination and largely overlapping European distributions (Friedrich, 1979).

126

Reproductive isolation mainly results mainly from adaptation to different habitats and from

127

pollinator-mediated assortative mating (Favre, Widmer, & Karrenberg, 2017; Goulson &

128

Jerrim, 1997; Karrenberg et al., 2019). Pink-flowered S. dioica occurs in colder habitats,

129

whereas white-flowered S. latifolia is found in in warmer and more disturbed habitats

130

(Friedrich, 1979; Karrenberg & Favre, 2008). Intrinsic and post-zygotic barriers, such as

131

pollen competition and hybrid breakdown, are comparatively weak suggesting that ecological

132

divergence drives speciation (Favre et al., 2017; Karrenberg et al., 2019). The genetic

133

architecture of traits associated with various reproductive barriers involves a large number of

134

loci distributed over most of the genome, with evidence for clustering (Liu & Karrenberg,

135

2018). Hu and Filatov (2015) estimated net non-synonymous sequence divergence (Da)

136

between the species to 0.0027 for autosomal loci, similar to animal systems with incomplete

137

speciation (Roux et al., 2016). Demographic models further suggest that divergence with gene

138

flow is more likely than strict isolation (Guirao-Rico, Sánchez-Gracia, & Charlesworth, 2017;

139

Hu & Filatov, 2015; Muir, Dixon, Harper, & Filatov, 2012); however, secondary contact

140

scenarios have not been tested and heterogeneity in migration rates or effective population

141

size was not modeled thus far.

142

In this study, we investigated evolutionary processes driving genetic differentiation between

143

Silene dioica and S. latifolia and using range-wide population sampling and a reduced

144

representation sequencing technique (double-digest RAD sequencing; Peterson, Weber, Kay,

145

Fisher, & Hoekstra, 2012), together with previous results on QTL mapping for traits

146

associated with reproductive barriers (Liu & Karrenberg, 2018). We first explored the

147

demographic history of the two species taking into account heterogeneity in migration rate

148

and effective population size. As a second step, we described the genomic landscape of

149

differentiation using linkage maps (Liu & Karrenberg, 2018) and tested for signatures of

150

selection in highly differentiated regions. Moreover, we investigated whether regions with

151

elevated differentiation are associated with QTLs for reproductive barrier traits (Liu &

152

Karrenberg, 2018) and with reduced gene flow. This integrated approach allows us to

153

evaluate evidence for barrier loci and infer the evolutionary forces generating them.

Materials and methods

155

Sampling of species and populations

156

We sampled 11 populations of Silene dioica and 9 populations of S. latifolia throughout their

157

distribution ranges (Figure 1a). For each population, maternal seed families were collected

158

from individuals at least 5 m apart. Seeds of 8-12 maternal families per population, except for

159

the S. latifolia population from Russia (RUS1), which was sampled as a pooled seed lot

160

without family structure, were grown in the greenhouse at Evolutionary Biology Centre,

161

Uppsala University, Sweden (Table S1, Supporting Information). 189 individuals of S. dioica

162

and 162 of S. latifolia were sampled for DNA extraction and ddRADseq sequencing.

163

ddRAD sequencing and genotyping

164

Genomic DNA from silica-dried leaf tissues was extracted using Qiagen’s DNeasy Plant Mini

165

Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Fluorometer (Life

166

Technologies, Sweden). We prepared libraries for double-digest RAD sequencing (ddRAD-

167

seq) with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and TaqαI as described in Liu and Karrenberg (2018).

168

Briefly, enzymatically digested DNA was ligated with barcoded adaptors and size-selected to

169

approximately 550 bp (Peterson, Weber, Kay, Fisher, & Hoekstra, 2012). In total, nine 48-

170

plex libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 systems at the SNP&SEQ technology

171

platform of SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden using 125-bp paired-end chemistry with two

172

libraries combined to one lane.

173

ddRAD-seq data were processed following the dDocent pipeline v2.2 (Puritz, Hollenbeck, &

174

Gold, 2014). First, we de-multiplexed raw reads using the process_radtag function of Stacks

175

(Catchen, Hohenlohe, Bassham, Amores, & Cresko, 2013). We then pruned bases of low

176

quality and adapter sequences by Trimmomatic (Bolger, Lohse, & Usadel, 2014). We

177

implemented BWA-MEM v0.7.16 (Li, 2013) to align cleaned reads to reference contigs

178

previously assembled from eight deeply sequenced individuals from Switzerland (Liu &

179

Karrenberg, 2018), as there is no full genome sequence available for Silene thus far

180

(Krasovec, Chester, Ridout, & Filatov, 2018). We extended the reference with contigs built

181

from unmapped pairs of reads with occurrences of at least 4X within an individual and

182

present in at least 4 individuals using the de novo RAD assembler Rainbow (Chong, Ruan, &

183

Wu, 2012). We aligned reads to the new reference with BWA-MEM v0.7.16 allowing up to 3

184

mismatches and excluded highly clipped sequences (Li, 2013). We employed Freebayes

185

(Garrison & Marth, 2012) for variant calling on the basis of populations with a minimum

186

mapping quality score of 5 and a minimum base quality of 5.

187

Raw variants were filtered using VCFtools (Danecek et al., 2011) with the following criteria:

188

a minimum quality score of 30, a minimum coverage of 6X, and a minimum genotype call

189

rate of 70% across all samples excluding those were genotyped at < 6% of all sites. We later

190

decomposed complex variant calls into single SNPs using the vcfallelicprimatives command

191

from vcflib (Garrison, 2012). To filter spurious SNPs potentially due to paralogs, we

192

excluded SNPs at which allele balance (AB) for heterozygous genotypes was below 0.25 or

193

above 0.75, SNPs covered by both forward and reverse reads and SNPs with excessive

194

coverage (> 100X) (O'Leary, Puritz, Willis, Hollenbeck, & Portnoy, 2018). We included rare

195

variants, which potentially evolved recently, to avoid biased estimation of site frequency

196

spectra (no filter for minor allele frequency).

197

Population structure

198

We analyzed population structure using ADMIXTURE (Alexander, Novembre, & Lange,

199

2009).To prepare the input, SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium were removed using PLINK

200

(Purcell et al., 2007) with the recommended settings: a window size of 50 SNPs, a step size of

201

10 SNPs and threshold of R2 equal to 0.1. We examined the clustering of individuals in

202

ADMIXTURE with the number of groups (K), set to two, the number of species, and 20, the

203

number of populations. In addition to the ADMIXTURE analysis, we also assessed the

204

relationships between populations using a neighbor-joining tree based on genetic distance in

205

the R package hierfstat (Goudet, 2004).

206

Demographic modeling

207

To investigate the evolutionary history of lineage-split between Silene. dioica and S. latifolia,

208

we performed demographical modeling based on the folded joint site frequency spectrum

209

(SFS) using the software ∂a∂i, which implements an diffusion approximation-based approach

210

(Gutenkunst et al., 2009). We randomly selected one SNP per reference contig for subsequent

211

analysis in order to satisfy the condition of independence among SNPs for composite

212

likelihood ratio tests. To avoid close relatedness among individuals, we also randomly picked

213

two individuals of different families per population. The SFS was projected onto 20 haploid

214

samples, corresponding to 10 diploid individuals in each group to maximize the number of

215

segregating sites.

216

We first considered a standard set of demographic scenarios: strict isolation without gene

217

flow (SI), isolation with gene flow (IM), secondary contact (SC) and ancient migration (AM)

218

(Figure S2, Supporting Information). We added population expansion to each model ("exp"

219

models). In separate models, we added heterogeneity in migration rate, m, (for models with

220

gene flow, IM, SC, AM, "hm’" models). Here we considered two categories of loci: barrier

221

loci without migration (m = 0) and loci for which m is freely estimated (m > 0). We modeled

222

heterogeneity in effective population size in all four models ("hn" models) allowing for

223

evolution of two sets of loci with different effective population sizes (Ne1 and Ne2). We further

224

simulated scenarios including heterogeneity in both migration rate and population size

225

("hmhn" models) with four sets of loci: m = 0 and Ne1, m = 0 and Ne2, m > 0 and Ne1, and

226

m > 0 and Ne2. In total, we assessed 18 demographic models and optimized each with the

227

observed joint SFS using 20 replicate runs with perturbed parameters as starting points. We

228

excluded SC models that did not converge and had very short periods of unrealistically high

229

gene flow (2Nem > 30) (personal communication, Ryan Gutenkunst). Nested model

230

comparisons were performed using likelihood ratio tests; comparisons of non-nested models

231

were based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

232

We estimated the demographic parameters from the best-support model, including divergence

233

time, population sizes, migration rates, and proportions of the different types of loci (where

234

included), with 95% confidence intervals constructed using 500 rounds of re-sampling SNPs

235

from contigs. In ∂a∂i, divergence time is inferred in units of 2Nref generations. Nref constitutes

236

the ancestral effective population size and can be estimated based on θ = 4 Nref µ L, where θ

237

denotes the population mutation rate, µ the mutation rate per site per generation, and L the

238

effective sequence length involved. We estimated L as the total base number of the reference

239

contigs meeting filtering criteria. We used a generation time of one year and a mutation rate µ

240

of 7.92 × 10-9 (Krasovec et al., 2018).

241

Calculation of differentiation, sequence divergence and diversity statistics

242

We calculated differentiation between the two species as hierarchical F-statistics

243

("hierarchical FST") to account for population structure within species using AMOVA models

244

in the R package hierfstat (Goudet, 2004) for both SNPs and contigs. We also calculated

245

Nei´s estimate of FST between all population pairs (between species and within species). We

246

calculated sequence divergence, dXY, between the two species using a custom Perl script.

247

Within each species, we computed genetic diversity (π) using VCFtools (Danecek et al.,

248

2011) and estimated Tajima’s D using a custom Perl script. For contig-based calculations

249

dependent of sequence length (dXY, π and Tajima’s D), we determined contig length as

250

number of bases meeting SNP filtering criteria (read depth > 5 per individual; coverage:

251

>70% of the individuals).

252

Genome scans using linkage maps

253

We examined genome-wide patterns in differentiation, sequence divergence and diversity

254

statistics by mapping the contigs onto the two linkage maps constructed in a previous study

255

from two F2 crosses between S. dioica and S. latifolia: F2DL (1470 markers) and F2LD (1265

256

markers) (Liu & Karrenberg, 2018). The two linkage maps are treated separately here because

257

only 20% of the contigs with mapped markers are shared between the two maps (Liu &

258

Karrenberg, 2018). Uncertainty in marker order on a consensus map, particularly in marker-

259

dense regions, may lead to spurious patterns. We used the local polynomial regression

260

(LOESS) curve along each linkage group to represent patterns for each statistic (Cleveland,

261

1979).

262

Genomic landscapes and signatures of selection

263

As a first step, we analyzed correlations between contig-based FST and dXY using a

264

permutation test in the R package coin (Hothorn, Hornik, Wiel, & Zeileis, 2006). We further

265

identified genomic islands of elevated differentiation as contig sequences with hierarchical

266

FST exceeding the 95% quantile of the overall FST value distribution. To assess signatures of

267

selection in these highly differentiated regions, we compared dXY, π and Tajima’s D between

268

the differentiation islands and background regions using Mood’s median test via the R

269

package coin (Hothorn et al., 2006). The above analyses were performed both for mapped

270

contigs (data from both linkage maps combined) and for all contigs in our dataset.

271

Within vs. between species differentiation

272

Genetic differentiation landscapes within and between species are expected to correlate if they

273

are mainly governed by background selection and conserved genomic features (Burri, 2017;

274

Vijay et al., 2017). We assessed the role of background selection for the generation of the

275

differentiation landscape by comparing differentiation landscape between species

276

(hierarchical FST) to differentiation landscapes within species using the population pairs with

277

the highest FST within each species. We further evaluated correlations (across contigs) of

278

hierarchical FST and within-species FST for both mapped and all contigs using a permutation

279

test the R package coin (Hothorn et al., 2006).

280

Differentiation near QTLs for reproductive barrier traits

281

We first compared the location of highly differentiated regions to the previously identified

282

QTLs for traits associated with reproductive barriers between Silene dioica and S. latifolia

283

(Liu & Karrenberg, 2018): assortative mating (flower color, flower size, flower number, stem

284

height), habitat adaptation (first-year flowering, specific leaf area, leaf succulence, survival),

285

phenology (flowering time) and hybrid male fertility reduction (pollen number). As a second

286

step, we assessed whether genetic differentiation in regions associated with different

287

reproductive barriers (contigs within 1 cM of QTLs) had significantly higher medians of

288

hierarchical FST between species than or all mapped markers using a randomization test. We

289

obtained the distributions of medians under the null hypothesis (no difference) using of 10,

290

000 sets of randomly selected contigs of the same size as the number of contigs associated

291

each barrier type. We determined the percentile of the observed medians in the respective

distributions of medians from randomly selected datasets and expressed P-values as 1 minus

293

this percentile.

294

Patterns of isolation by distance within and between species

295

We examined the relationships between pair-wise FST between populations (within Silene

296

dioica, within S. latifolia and between species) and geographical distance for differentiation

297

islands and for regions of low differentiation (hierarchical FST below the 25% quantile of the

298

overall distribution). Correlation tests between FST and geographic distance were performed

299

using Mantel permutation tests implemented in the R package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2019).

Results

301

Sequencing output

302

We obtained on average 4,303,869 reads per individuals from ddRAD sequencing, which in

303

total yielded 1,799,882,123 reads. After filtering, we retained 87,006 SNPs for the

304

downstream analysis with an average read coverage of 21.2. These SNPs were located on

305

10,415 contigs with an average length of 251 bp. 1327 contigs could were present on linkage

306

maps (817 contigs on the F2DL map, 632 contigs on the F2LD map, 122 contigs on both maps).

307

Population structure and overall hierarchical F

308

We used a set of 36,413 SNPs after pruning for linkage disequilibrium to analyze population

309

structure. With K = 2, two groups are clearly separated as well, corresponding to S. dioica and

310

S. latifolia, with limited admixture in a few populations (Figure 1b), particularly especially,

311

the Swiss populations of both species (CH1 and CH3) and the Belgian population of

312

S. latifolia (BEL1). With K = 20, the number of natural populations included in the study, all

314

within species (Figure S3, supporting Information). A phylogenetic tree based on genetic

315

distance also showed two clusters, consisting of populations from each species (Figure 1c).

316

The overall hierarchical FST between S. dioica and S. latifolia was 0.28, as estimated from

317

AMOVA analysis (Table 1). Average pair-wise weighted FST was 0.357 (range: 0.261 –

318

0.424) for between species population pairs, 0.099 (range: 0.019 – 0.165) for population pairs

319

within S. dioica and 0.136 (range: 0.027 - 0.267) for population pairs within S. latifolia (Fig.

320

1d). This is in agreement with the phylogentic tree, where branch lengths of S. latifolia

321

populations were longer than those of S. dioica populations (Figure 1c).

322

Demographic history of lineage divergence

323

Models involving migration generally outperformed the strict isolation (SI) models

324

significantly, based on AIC (Figure 2, Figure S2, Table S2, Supporting Information). These

325

models, isolation with migration (IM), secondary contact (SC) and ancient migration (AM),

326

were slightly improved by adding population expansion ("exp" models) but substantially

327

improved by adding heterogeneity in migration rate ("hm" models), effective population size

328

("hn" models) or both migration rate and population size ("hmhn" models, Figure 2, Table S2,

329

Supporting Information). Under each scenario (IM, SC and AM), the model including

330

heterogeneity in both population size and migration rate ("hmhn" models) had the best fit, as

331

indicated by likelihood ratio tests (Table S2, Supporting Information). The overall best-

332

supported model in terms of AIC was the isolation with migration model with heterogeneous

333

population size and migration rate ("IMhmhn", Figure 2, Table S2, Supporting Information).

334

SC and AM models with heterogeneous population sizes and migration rates ("SChmhn",

335

"AMhmhn") fit the data nearly as well; however, in both scenarios, the estimated duration of

336

the phase without gene flow was close to zero, such that they converge to the IMhmhn model

337

(Tables S2 and S3, Supporting Information).

338

The best-supported IMhmhn model reflected the joint site frequency spectrum fairly well and

339

residuals were mainly in the range of -2 to 2 (Figure 3, Figure S3, Supporting Information).

340

Under this model, 39% of the loci had reduced effective population size and 5% of the loci

341

conformed to a scenario of divergence without gene flow (Table 2). Most of these potential

342

barrier loci had reduced Ne (4.4% of all loci with m = 0 and low Ne and m = 0; 0.4% of all loci

343

with m = 0 and high Ne). It is worth noting that adding heterogeneity in both m and Ne

344

strongly affected estimates of the proportion of loci without gene flow.

345

The estimated median population migration rate across the genome from the IMhmhn model

346

was 0.22 (95% CI: [0.14-1.43]) migrants per generation from S. latifolia to S. dioica and 0.33

347

(95% CI: [0.23-2.4]) from S. dioica to S. latifolia (Table 2). We obtained an effective

348

population size of 188,526 (95% CI: [157,506-342278]) for S. dioica and 278,607 (95% CI:

349

[217,667-594,702]) for S. latifolia. The divergence time between S. dioica and S. latifolia was

350

estimated to be 0.12 million years (95% CI: [0.087-0.23] myrs) assuming a generation time of

351

one year (Table 2).

352

Genomic landscape of differentiation, sequence divergence and diversity

353

Hierarchical FST on both SNP- and contig-based levels fluctuated widely across the genome

354

(Figure 4, Figure S4, Supporting Information). Both hierarchical FST and sequence

355

divergence, dXY, reached peaks around the middle of most linkage groups on both linkage

356

maps (Figure 4, Figure S4, Supporting Information), in spite of largely different SNP markers

357

(Liu & Karrenberg, 2018). FST and dXY were significantly correlated (mapped contigs:

358

r = 0.347, P < 0.001, all contigs: r = 0.464, P < 0.001, based on 9999 permutations). Highly

359

divergent regions in the middle of linkage groups often contained loci with reduced

360

nucleotide diversity (π) and more negative Tajima´s D in one or both species (Figure 4,

361

Figures S4, S5, S6, Supporting Information).

362

For mapped contigs, dXY was significantly elevated in genomic islands of differentiation as

363

compared to the genomic background, and both π and Tajima's D were significantly reduced

364

in both species (Figure 5, Table S4, Supporting Information). Results from all contigs were

365

very similar, except that π was not significantly reduced in differentiation islands within

366

S. latifolia (Figure S7, Supporting Information, Table S4, Supporting Information).

367

Within- vs. between-species differentiation

368

The genomic landscapes of differentiation between species generally did not coincide with

369

that of highly differentiated population pairs within S. latifolia (ESP1 vs. RUS1, overall

370

FST = 0.27) or within S. dioica (FO1 vs. POL1, overall FST = 0.16, Figure 4). Within species

371

comparisons had less pronounced FST peaks in the middle of several linkage groups as

372

compared to between species hierarchical FST, whereas the remaining linkage groups showed

373

no obvious differentiation peaks in within species comparisons (Figure 5, Figure S4,

374

Supporting Information). Correlations of within species FST and between species hierarchical

375

FST were weak (mapped contigs: r = 0.028, P = 0.319 for S. dioica and r = 0.11, P < 0.001 for

376

S. latifolia; all contigs: r = 0.071, P < 0.001 for S. dioica and r = 0.147, P < 0.001 for S.

Differentiation near QTLs for reproductive barrier traits

QTLs for traits associated with reproductive barriers often resided in genomic regions with

high FST and dXY were concentrated (Figure 4, Figure S4, Supporting Information). Contigs

381

mapping within 1 cM of QTLs associated with assortative mating had significantly elevated

382

median FST (0.249) as compared to the median FST of all mapped contigs (0.192, P = 0.039,

383

randomization test); but this was not true for contigs near QTLs associated with habitat

384

adaptation (median FST: 0.098, P = 0.992), phenology (median FST: 0.184, P = 0.564) or

385

hybrid male fertility reduction median FST: 0.275, P = 0.097, Figure 6).

386

Patterns of isolation by distance

387

Within S. dioica, pair-wise FST was only weakly associated with geographical distances

388

(Figure 7a, Figure S9a, Table S5, Supporting Information). Within S. latifolia, in contrast, we

389

generally detected significant associations of geographic distance with pairwise FST isolation

390

by distance patterns (Figure 7b, Figure S9b, Table S5, Supporting Information). In both

391

species, differentiation islands exhibited slightly elevated pair-wise FST and a tendency for a

392

weaker correlation between pair-wise FST and geographic distance as compared to loci with

393

low between-species differentiation (Figures 7, Figure S9, Table S5, Supporting Information).

394

In between-species population pairs, pair-wise FST correlated strongly and significantly with

395

geographical distance at loci with low between-species differentiation. At differentiation

396

islands, in contrast, no significant increase of pair-wise FST with geographical distance was

397

detected, suggesting that many of these loci constitute barrier loci (Figure 7c, Figure S9c,

398

Table S5, Supporting Information). For these latter analyses we excluded pair-wise

399

comparisons to one S. latifolia population (CH2) that showed strongly reduced pair-wise FST

400

for highly differentiated regions, and moderately reduced pair-wise FST for regions with low

401

differentiation (Figure 7, Figure S9). This population also exhibited signs of admixture

402

(Figure 1b).

403

Discussion

404

In this study, we investigated the evolutionary processes leading to divergence between two

405

closely related and hybridizing campion species, Silene dioica and S. latifolia. We sampled

406

populations throughout the distribution ranges of each species and generated reduced

407

representation sequencing data. We used an integrated approach and performed demographic

408

modeling combined with population genomic analyses. Together, our results support a model

409

where the two species diverged with continuous gene flow but have evolved barrier loci at

410

which gene flow is reduced. Our analyses further indicate that divergent selection contributed

411

to the evolution of putative barrier loci while background selection played a limited role.

412

Demographic history supports divergence with gene flow and barrier loci

413

Demographic analyses suggest that S. dioica and S. latifolia diverged with continuous gene

414

flow, in line with evidence for ongoing hybridization in natural populations of the two species

415

(Karrenberg & Favre, 2008; Minder et al., 2007). Similar scenarios of comparatively

416

advanced divergence (hierarchical FST = 0.28 in our study) combined with persistent gene

417

flow are only rarely reported, for example in Japanese sticklebacks (Ravinet et al., 2018) and

418

Heliconius butterflies (Martin et al., 2013). Demographic analyses in many other systems, in

419

contrast, point to divergence in para/allopatry with gene flow only during secondary or

420

intermittent contact (Christe et al., 2017; Duranton et al., 2018; Tine et al., 2014). In our

421

analysis, secondary contact (SC) and ancient migration (AM) models had only slightly less

422

support than the best-supported isolation with migration (IM) models (but with an AIC

423

difference exceeding 2). However, periods without gene flow in AM and SC models were

424

extremely short, such that they effectively converged to the best-supported IM model.

425

Nonetheless, we cannot exclude more complex demographic scenarios such as multiple short

426

periods of allopatry combined with population expansion (Christe et al., 2017). Large effects

427

of population expansion are unlikely though, based on simple IM models with population

428

expansion in this study, as well as in (Muir et al., 2012) and in Guirao-Rico et al. (2017). We

429

are therefore confident that our isolation with migration model captures the main aspects of

430

the two species' demographic history.

431

Our demographic models included and supported heterogeneity in both migration rate and

432

effective population size. This is in line with results from various animal systems where

433

heterogeneous migration rates were most common at intermediate stages of speciation,

434

whereas support for heterogeneity in effective population size varied across systems

435

irrespective of the speciation stage (Roux et al., 2016). We estimated that 5% of the loci

436

evolved without gene flow and thus potentially barrier loci. Our analyses further indicate that

437

these putative barrier loci were concentrated in regions with reduced effective population

438

sizes as predicted by models of speciation with gene flow (Ortiz-Barrientos & James, 2017;

439

Ravinet et al., 2017; Seehausen et al., 2014; Yeaman et al., 2016). However, effects of

440

heterogeneity in population size and migration on the joint site frequency spectrum can be

441

difficult to distinguish (Christe et al., 2017; Rougemont & Bernatchez, 2018; Roux et al.,

442

2016).

443

Our results generally agree with previous demographic analyses in the two species that used

444

more limited datasets and simpler models but also rejected strict isolation scenarios in favor

445

of divergence with gene flow (Guirao-Rico et al., 2017; Hu & Filatov, 2015; Muir et al.,

446

2012). We estimated divergence time to 0.12 million years before present, considerably

447

earlier than estimates of Muir et al. (2012), Hu and Filatov (2015) and Guirao-Rico et al.

448

(2017). This is likely a consequence of including heterogeneity in population size and

449

migration rate in demographic models in this study, as indicated by comparisons of estimates

450

under the best-supported model and under a model similar to those employed in previous

451

studies (Guirao-Rico et al., 2017; Hu & Filatov, 2015; Muir et al., 2012). Our divergence time

452

estimate places the lineage split close to the onset of the most recent glaciation in Europe with

453

rapid environmental changes (Hewitt, 2000). However, this estimate is contingent on a

454

generation time of one year observed for these species (Favre et al., 2017; Hu & Filatov,

455

2015; Muir et al., 2012) but generation time can also be two or three years in colder

456

environments (Favre et al., 2017). Average migration rate estimates (M = 2Nem) from our

457

best-supported model (0.22 [CI: 0.14 - 1.43] and 0.33 [0.23 - 2.4] from S. latifolia into

458

S. dioica and vice versa) were similar to those reported by Muir et al. (2012) but lower than

459

those reported by Hu and Filatov (2015). Estimates of migration rate were further consistent

460

with near-complete reproductive isolation, mostly through adaptation to the habitat and to

461

pollinators (Karrenberg et al., 2019). The proportion of the gene pool replaced by the other

462

species per generation m, was estimated to ca. 6 x 10-7 here, and can be compared for the

463

probability of F1 hybrid production, Phyb (Sambatti, Strasburg, Ortiz-Barrientos, Baack, &

464

Rieseberg, 2012). m was several orders of magnitude smaller than Phyb estimated from the

465

strength of reproductive isolation (Phyb = 1-RItotal: 0.010-0.036, depending on the direction),

466

suggesting that additional ecological or genetic reproductive barriers may exist (Karrenberg et

467

al., 2019). Overall, we thus establish realistic demographic estimates for a likely case of

468

speciation in the face of gene flow in plants.

473

chromosome centers has been described for diverse taxa and attributed to reduced

474

recombination rates in the middle of metacentric chromosomes (Berner & Roesti, 2017;

475

Nachman & Payseur, 2012). Chromosomes of S. latifolia are indeed metacentric or sub-

476

metacentric (Lengerova et al., 2004); however, direct recombination rate estimates are not

477

available for Silene to date. In our study, FST and dXY were positively correlated and highly

478

differentiated regions (genomic islands of differentiation) had an approximately two-fold

479

higher median dXY as compared to remaining genomic regions. Moreover, linkage group

480

centers often harbored previously identified QTLs for reproductive barriers traits (see also

481

below) with evidence of clustering (Liu & Karrenberg, 2018). In a divergence-with-gene flow

482

scenario, as in the species studied here, these results are suggestive of reductions in gene flow

483

and thus barrier loci co-localizing in low-recombination regions (Cruickshank & Hahn, 2014;

484

Nachman & Payseur, 2012; Rafajlović, Emanuelsson, Johannesson, Butlin, & Mehlig, 2016;

485

Ravinet et al., 2017; Seehausen et al., 2014; Yeaman et al., 2016); however, we cannot

486

exclude that lineage sorting in the ancestor also contributed to the pattern (Pease, Haak, Hahn,

487

& Moyle, 2016; Richards et al., 2019). Evidence for genomic islands with elevated FST and

488

dXY are comparatively rare and have been reported for Darwin´s finches (Han et al., 2017)

489

European sea bass (Duranton et al., 2018) and poplars (Wang et al., 2016). Our findings are in

490

stark contrast to many other systems where differentiation landscapes are mainly shaped by

491

background selection acting on a heterogeneous recombination landscapes: under this

492

scenario, dXY is not elevated or even reduced in regions of high differentiation and

493

differentiation landscapes across replicate species pairs are correlated (Burri, 2017; Nachman

494

& Payseur, 2012), as reported in sunflowers (Renaut et al., 2013) and different bird lineages

495

(Burri et al., 2015; Delmore et al., 2018; Vijay et al., 2017). In our study, we found only weak

496

correlations of FST between species with FST between highly divergent populations within

497

species, and FST between within-species population pairs was only slightly elevated at

498

between-species islands of differentiation. This may indicate limited effects of background

499

selection; however, loci diverging with gene flow may also repeatedly arise in the same

500

regions, for example, low-recombination regions (Berner & Roesti, 2017; Samuk et al., 2017;

501

Yeaman et al., 2016). Our results are thus consistent with and important role of barrier loci in

502

generating the differentiation landscape.

503

Signatures of selection at highly differentiated regions

504

Genomic islands of high differentiation show significant signatures of selection (Nielsen,

505

2005) within both species: reduced sequence diversity and an overrepresentation of rare

506

variants (reduced and negative Tajima's D). Together with our results on sequence

507

divergence, dXY, these findings suggest that highly differentiated regions, containing potential

508

barrier loci, arose through divergent selection. Reproductive isolation between the two species

509

is mainly associated with adaptation to the habitat and, presumably, to pollinators (Favre et

510

al., 2017; Goulson & Jerrim, 1997; Karrenberg et al., 2019). Signatures of selection in highly

511

divergent regions in other systems have been detected in ecotypes or early-stage ecological

512

speciation in three-spined sticklebacks (Feulner et al., 2015; Marques et al., 2017; Samuk et

513

al., 2017) and in cichlids (Malinsky et al., 2015; Meier et al., 2018), as well as in more

514

advanced stages of speciation in poplars (Wang et al., 2016). Our results thus provide

515

additional evidence for an important role of divergent selection in generating the genomic

516

landscape of differentiation.

Elevated differentiation near QTLs for reproductive isolation traits

We detected elevated differentiations in 1 cM regions surrounding previously identified QTLs

520

with other reproductive barriers (Karrenberg et al., 2019) such as habitat adaptation,

521

phenology or hybrid male fertility reduction. This could be due to a particularly important

522

role of assortative mating as a reproductive barrier (Coyne & Orr, 2004; Marques et al., 2017;

523

Martin et al., 2013; Riesch et al., 2017). Alternatively, this finding may result from a simpler

524

genetic architecture of floral traits as compared ecological divergence - adaptive divergence in

525

traits with complex genetic architectures may not lead to high differentiation at any of the

526

involved loci (Liu & Karrenberg, 2018; Rockman, 2012; Yeaman, 2015). However, these

527

patterns are very difficult to interpret, given the scarce genome coverage of the reduced

528

representation sequencing data used here and the large confidence intervals of some the QTL

529

location. Nonetheless, our results are consistent with our interpretation that adaptive

530

divergence and the ensuing reproductive barriers shaped the genomic landscape of

531

differentiation in this system.

532

Highly differentiated regions are barriers to gene flow between species

533

Within S. latifolia, we detected significant isolation by distance patterns consistent with post-

534

glacial range expansion, whereas an isolation by distance pattern was very weak S. dioica,

535

possibly because geographical distance does not reflect dispersal routes very well in

536

mountainous regions (Hathaway, Malm, & Prentice, 2009; Prentice, Malm, & Hathaway,

537

2008; Rautenberg, Hathaway, Oxelman, & Prentice, 2010). In between-species population

538

pairs, FST significantly increased with geographical distance at loci with low differentiation

539

between species, indicating that the two species are connected by gene flow. At highly

540

differentiated loci, in contrast, no significant FST increase with geographical distance was

541

detected, suggesting that many of these loci constitute barrier loci. This is in line with results

542

of heterogeneous gene flow from our demographic analysis. Between-species comparisons

543

involving one S. latifolia population from Switzerland, with comparatively high admixture,

544

had generally reduced between-species FST, particularly for highly differentiated loci. This is

545

likely due to recent hybridization and introgression in this population. Ongoing hybridization

546

has previously been documented for this area (Karrenberg & Favre, 2008; Minder et al.,

547

2007). Overall, these results suggest that highly differentiated regions correspond to between-

548

species barriers to gene flow.

549

Conclusion

550

Multiple lines of evidence support the evolution of barrier loci during speciation with gene

551

flow in the campions Silene dioica and S. latifolia: (1) demographic analyses indicate

552

divergence with continuous and heterogeneous gene flow, (2) differentiation (FST) and

553

sequence divergence (dXY) were positively correlated and elevated in the middle of most

554

linkage groups (3) highly differentiated regions exhibited signatures of selection, and

555

differentiation was elevated near QTLs for reproductive barrier traits, and (4) isolation by

556

distance patterns suggest that S. dioica and S. latifolia are connected by gene flow at regions

557

with low differentiation but not at islands of high differentiation. Strong cumulative

558

reproductive isolation in this system results mainly from adaptation to the habitat and to

559

pollinators (Karrenberg et al., 2019) with polygenic and clustered genetic architectures (Liu &

560

Karrenberg, 2018). The results of this study thus align well with theoretical predictions for

561

ecological speciation where divergence in the face of homogenizing gene flow is promoted by

562

linkage between allelic combinations at loci under selection (clustering, coupling),

563

particularly in genomic areas of low recombination (Butlin & Smadja, 2018; Ortiz-Barrientos

564

& James, 2017; Ravinet et al., 2017; Seehausen et al., 2014; Yeaman et al., 2016). Empirical

565

evidences for these predictions are, thus far, scarce and dominated by systems at early stages

566

of speciation (Feulner et al., 2015; Malinsky et al., 2015; Marques et al., 2017; Meier et al.,

567

2018; Samuk et al., 2017). Later-stage cases appear to be rare, presumably because gene flow

568

is expected to cease rapidly at later stages of speciation leading to rapid genome-wide

569

differentiation (Flaxman et al., 2014; Ravinet et al., 2018; Riesch et al., 2017). The Silene

570

system represents such a comparatively advanced stage of speciation with still highly

571

heterogeneous differentiation. The data presented here suggest that this heterogeneity in

572

differentiation is generated by divergent selection driving the evolution of barrier loci.

Model type

Figure 2. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) for demographic models of the lineage split
between the campions Silene dioica and S. latifolia in four scenarios: strict isolation (SI),
isolation with migration (IM), secondary contact (SC) and ancient migration (AM). Models
contained no further parameters ("basic"), allowed for populations expansion ("exp"), or
included heterogeneity in migration rate ("hm"), effective population size ("hn") or both
parameters ("hmhn"). "hm" and "hmhn" models were not calculated for the SI scenario which
does not include any migration.
