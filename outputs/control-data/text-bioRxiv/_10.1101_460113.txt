Abstract
CrAss-like phages are double-stranded DNA viruses that are prevalent in human gut
microbiomes. Here, we analyze gut metagenomic data from mother-infant pairs and patients
undergoing fecal microbiota transplantation to evaluate the patterns of acquisition, transmission
and strain diversity of crAss-like phages. We find that crAss-like phages are rarely detected at
birth but are increasingly prevalent in the infant microbiome after one month of life. We observe
nearly identical genomes in 50% of cases where the same crAss-like clade is detected in both
the mother and the infant, suggesting vertical transmission. In cases of putative transmission of
prototypical crAssphage (p-crAssphage), we find that a subset of strains present in the mother
are detected in the infant, and that strain diversity in infants increases with time. Strain diversity
in the p-crAssphage population in mothers is generally low, with a median of 50 variable sites in
the 97kb genome. Putative tail fiber proteins are enriched for nonsynonymous strain variation
compared to other genes, suggesting a potential evolutionary benefit to maintaining strain
diversity in specific genes. Finally, we show that p-crAssphage can be acquired through fecal
microbiota transplantation. These results enhance our understanding of the acquisition,
individual-level strain diversity, and transmission of crAss-like phages, which have emerged as
some of the most successful human-associated microbes.

Main text
Introduction
In addition to trillions of bacteria, the human gastrointestinal tract is densely populated
with bacteriophages. Bacteriophages can drive bacterial community composition and mediate
horizontal gene transfer1, and alterations in the human gut virome have been associated with
disease2,3. However, our knowledge of the contributions of specific bacteriophages to human
biology is limited, in part due to the paucity of viral sequences represented in reference
databases. High-throughput sequencing and advanced genomic tools have facilitated the in
silico discovery and characterization of previously unknown bacteriophages. The preeminent
example of such a discovery is crAssphage (cross-Assembly phage), initially identified from
human virome sequencing data4. A bacteriophage with a ~97 kilobase circular, double-stranded
DNA genome, crAssphage sequences are found almost exclusively in human fecal
metagenomes in diverse populations globally5–8, and can be highly abundant. Initial estimates
indicate that crAssphage is present in up to 73-77% of humans4,5. Given the near ubiquity of
crAssphage and its apparent specificity to the human gut, quantitative PCR assays have been
developed to use crAssphage genes as markers for tracking human fecal pollution in water and
environmental samples9,10 and in human stool11.
More recent investigations have shown that crAssphage is one member of a wide range
of crAss-like phages that exist in the human microbiome5,12. In this manuscript, we adopt the
taxonomic classification system for crAss-like phages by Guerin et al. 5, which proposed 4
subfamily (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) and 10 cluster (1-10) designations based on shared
protein coding genes. The crAssphage first described by Dutilh et al.4 belongs to the Alpha
subfamily, cluster 1 and is given the designation prototypical crAssphage (p-crAssphage); we
use p-crAssphage in all further designations to avoid ambiguity. The genomes classified as

crAss-like phages by Guerin et al. are diverse - members of the same cluster share at least 40%
of protein coding genes, while members of the same subfamily share only 20%-40% of protein
coding genes.
It is not known whether or how crAss-like phages influence host biology or disease 13,14.
To answer higher-order questions about the role of crAss-like phages in human biology, it is
necessary to establish basic principles of acquisition, persistence, and distribution. While pcrAssphage has been detected in infant gut metagenomes7,13, it is not yet known how crAss-like
phages are acquired in infancy. Infants acquire many of their first microbes, such as
Bacteroides species, from their mother during and after delivery15–18. By contrast, it has been
demonstrated that adult twins and their mothers have unique gut viromes 19. Given that
Bacteroides species are hypothesized to be the bacterial host(s) of p-crAssphage4,20, and the
apparent specificity of p-crAssphage to the human gut as opposed to other mammals or
environmental samples, we postulated that p-crAssphage is vertically transmitted from mother
to infant, similar to what is observed for many bacterial taxa and in contrast to what is reported
for other members of the human virome. To test this hypothesis, we examined publicly available
shotgun metagenomic data from two stool microbiome datasets15,16 consisting of samples from
mothers and their infants (n=143 mother-infant pairs).
In this study, we find that p-crAssphage and other crAss-like phages are rarely detected
in the microbiome at birth but become detectable during the first year of life. We observe
>99.5% identical genome sequences in about one quarter of cases where mothers and infants
have the same crAss-like phage, suggesting vertical transmission from mother to infant. Infants
acquire a reduced diversity population of p-crAssphage compared to their mother, but strain
diversity expands upon colonization. Finally, by examining shotgun metagenomic data from
patients undergoing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), we show that FMT recipients can
acquire p-crAssphage with a nearly identical genome sequence as the stool donor. These
results begin to uncover the principles of acquisition and transmission of p-crAssphage and

other crAss-like phages, which are the most prevalent human-associated phages described, to
date.

Results
We evaluated the presence and abundance of p-crAssphage in the microbiomes of
mothers and infants by classifying sequencing reads with Kraken221, using a database of all
bacterial, viral and fungal genomes in NCBI GenBank assembled to complete genome,
chromosome or scaffold quality as of February 2019 (see Methods). P-crAssphage is
represented by a 97kb genome (accession NC_024711.1). Assigning absolute presence or
absence of an organism in metagenomic sequencing data is difficult and confounded by
sequencing depth. Here, we consider samples with ≥1,000 reads classified as p-crAssphage to
be evidence for presence, as this corresponds to roughly 1x coverage of the genome (assuming
100bp reads and a ~100kb genome length). Samples from mothers and infants had an average
of 8.7M reads after preprocessing, and the 1,000 read coverage threshold thus corresponds to
an average relative abundance of 0.011%. Of note, this somewhat arbitrary threshold, while
fairly specific, renders our approach limited in sensitivity - that is, we do not report on pcrAssphage when it is present at lower relative abundance.
Although p-crAssphage is highly abundant in the adult gut microbiome5,14 and has been
detected in infant gut microbiomes, it is unclear when or how it is acquired. Consistent with
previous studies describing low relative abundance or absence of p-crAssphage in the infant gut
microbiome7,22, we found 0 out of 22 infants have ≥1,000 p-crAssphage reads in samples
collected within 24 hours of birth (Table S1). P-crAssphage increases in prevalence as infants
age: it is detected in 3/35 (9%) infants from Yassour et al.16 by three months and 16/100 (16%)
infants in Bäckhed et al.15 by 12 months. P-crAssphage is more prevalent in adult mothers,
where it is detected in at least one sample from 8/35 (23%) and 25/100 (25%) of mothers in

each study, respectively (Figure S1). P-crAssphage is detected in both the mother and her
infant in ten cases, while 23/33 p-crAssphage positive mothers have a p-crAssphage negative
infant, and 9/19 p-crAssphage positive infants have a p-crAssphage negative mother.
The infant gut microbiome is strongly impacted by delivery mode, and it has been shown
that infants born by Cesarean section initially lack Bacteroides species16,18,23–25. In line with the
described effects of Cesarean section delivery and a hypothesized Bacteroidetes host, we
found that all 19 p-crAssphage positive infants were delivered vaginally, while all 21 infants
delivered through Cesarean section remained p-crAssphage negative. Although not significant
when each study is tested individually, the association between delivery mode and pcrAssphage presence is significant when samples from the two studies are combined (p=0.043,
Fisher’s exact test). This result contrasts with the findings of McCann et al.7, where the authors
found no association between p-crAssphage relative abundance and delivery mode.
Vertical transmission of gut microbes from mother to infant is common and welldescribed among certain bacterial taxa15–17,26. To test the hypothesis that p-crAssphage can be
vertically transmitted from mother to infant, we investigated metagenome-assembled pcrAssphage genomes from ten p-crAssphage positive mother-infant pairs (see Methods). In six
cases, mother-infant pairs had nearly identical assembled sequences (families M0226, M0808,
M1098, 335, 343 and 345; >99.7% similarity). Two mother-infant pairs had assembled
sequences more similar than unrelated pairs (families 263 and 268; 98-99.2% similarity), and
two mother-infant pairs had assembled sequences that were no more similar than unrelated
pairs (families 184 and 272; ~96% similarity) (Figure 1). Overall, related mothers and infants
harbor more closely related p-crAssphage sequences than unrelated mothers and infants
(Figure S2a). When all samples with sufficient p-crAssphage coverage were included in the
assembly comparison, no pairs from unrelated individuals had > 98% similarity (Figure S3).
Assembled p-crAssphage genomes were high quality and contiguous: in the 29 samples from
families with p-crAssphage found in mothers and infants, the median contig N50 was 59.6kb

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/460113; this version posted October 18, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

(standard deviation, SD= 41.4kb), median number of contigs was 3 (SD=17) and median total
assembled length was 96.3kb (SD=24.2kb) (assembly statistics reported in Table S2). One-toone pairwise alignments between assembled sequences from mother-infant pairs had a median
length of 85.8kb (SD=27.8kb). 22 samples assembled a nearly complete (>95kb) p-crAssphage
genome in a single contig. The assembled genomes also share 91.2% - 97.6% nucleotide
identity with the p-crAssphage reference genome, adding confidence that they are truly
representative assemblies. Next, we used a variant calling approach to identify fixed SNPs
compared to the p-crAssphage reference (see Methods). Pairs of samples were compared at
genomic sites covered ≥10x and used to construct a heatmap of SNP similarity. The same six
mother-infant pairs (M0226, M0808, M1098, 335, 343 and 345) had >99.5% SNP similarity and
continued to cluster together (Figure S4). Mother-infant pairs had higher SNP identity than
unrelated pairs on average (Figure S2b).
Metagenomic assembly only represents the dominant allele at each position, and a fixed
SNP comparison only considers sites that are identical across all strains present in a sample.
To understand the differing p-crAssphage strains present in the microbiome, we would ideally
phase strain “haplotypes” with a technology like long-read sequencing. With only short reads
available, we examined genomic positions that had multiple single nucleotide variant alleles
called at high-quality (≥5 reads for each allele, multiallelic sites) as a proxy for strain diversity.
We report a normalized statistic (Fmulti) to compare multiallelic sites across samples with highly
variable coverage. At a given minor allele fraction(AF), Fmulti is the proportion of multiallelic sites
with a minor AF > x among those sites covered well enough to detect a minor AF of x.
We calculated Fmulti for minor allele fractions of 0.40, 0.30, 0.20, and 0.10 and compared
across samples at a given minor AF value. At every AF tested, infants as a group had a smaller
fraction of multiallelic sites when compared to mothers as a group. (Figure 2a). In the three
cases where we detected p-crAssphage in multiple samples from the same infant, we found
more multiallelic sites in later samples. We were typically powered enough to detect multiallelic

sites of the observed AF in earlier samples, but we cannot rule out the possibility that newly
observed variants are below our limit of detection in earlier samples. Multiallelic sites in infants
are often fixed sites in the p-crAssphage population of the mother (Figure 2d). In contrast to
infants, mothers from Yassour et al.16 showed no change in the proportion of multiallelic sites
over the 6 month sampling period (Figure 2b). We then looked at multiallelic sites in mothers
that are fixed in matched infant samples. In 2/3 cases where we observed putative pcrAssphage transmission and the mother had ≥10 multiallelic sites, major alleles are
disproportionately detected in the child (Figure 2c). Taken together, these results suggest a few
potential models: one is that infants acquire a single strain or limited diversity of p-crAssphage
strains. As the infant microbiome matures and diversifies with age, the p-crAssphage population
can evolve and acquire genetic diversity. Alternatively, a larger spectrum of p-crAssphage
strains than is detected may be harbored in a mother, with some strains below the limit of our
detection. These strains may experience less selective pressure in the infant than in the mother;
thus, these strains may be more numerous and easily detected in the infant than they are in the
mother.
We continued to use multiallelic sites to investigate p-crAssphage strain diversity within
an individual. Mothers generally have limited strain diversity, with a median of 0.41 (SD=7.5)
multiallelic sites per kb at AF > 0.1; variation in 0.04% of the genome. In a small number of
cases, we do observe samples with up to 100x more frequent multiallelic sites (Figure 3a). This
allelic variation could be the result of many closely related strains existing together or a smaller
number of more divergent strains. Phasing strain “haplotypes” is necessary to distinguish
between these possibilities. Limited strain diversity suggest an exclusion principle, which favors
mono- or oligo-colonization of a particular p-crAssphage strain or closely-related strains within
the gut of an individual, though notably, a minority of individuals may be simultaneously
colonized by multiple diverse strains. P-crAssphage has fewer multiallelic sites on average
compared to Lactococcus phages, which are the only other group of phages detected at ≥1x

coverage in at least ten samples. Using the reference genome of the most frequently detected
individual phage, Lactococcus phage 16802, 34 samples had at least 1x coverage; these
samples had a median of 58.8 (SD=14.7) multiallelic sites per kb at AF > 0.1 (Figure S9).
We next evaluated whether strain variation in the p-crAssphage population was the
result of synonymous or nonsynonymous genomic changes. Variant effects were predicted
using the p-crAssphage genome annotation from GenBank and SnpEff27 (see Methods). We
compared the proportion of observed variant effects to a null model of equal probability of
mutation at every base in the reference genome. In samples from mothers, multiallelic sites with
predicted nonsynonymous and nonsense effects were less likely than expected under the null
model, while synonymous sites were more likely than expected (p < 1e-5 for each category,
likelihood ratio test). (Figure 3b). An overrepresentation of synonymous variants suggests that
strain diversity in the p-crAssphage population of mothers is enriched for neutral genetic
variation, which may have been acquired over the relatively long time the phages could have
been present in the microbiome. In contrast to mothers, the predicted effects of multiallelic sites
in infants were indistinguishable from the null model (p > 0.05 for each effect category,
likelihood ratio test). This may suggest that multiallelic sites in infants arise randomly and the
forces acting to influence the distribution of predicted sites in mothers have not had time to act
on the infant’s p-crAssphage population yet. Alternatively, selective pressures acting on pcrAssphage alleles may be entirely different in the infant and mother microbiome. Comparing
mother and infant distributions showed that only the proportion of synonymous multiallelic sites
was significantly different between the two (p = 0.04, likelihood ratio test). We note that
synonymous variants may not be truly neutral, as noncoding variants have been shown to affect
translation efficiency in bacteriophages28.
In adults, we find wide variation in the number of multiallelic sites across the pcrAssphage genome, with enrichment in the number of sites and the ratio of nonsynonymous to
synonymous variants corresponding to certain predicted genes (Figure 4). Multiallelic sites were

detected in 80/88 predicted genes. When genes were ranked by the length-normalized number
of nonsynonymous variants, “putative Tail sheath protein” was the top annotated gene, and
other predicted tail proteins also had high ratios (Table S4). Phage tail proteins are responsible
for host tropism29–31; therefore maintaining multiple functionally different alleles in the population
may be beneficial to expand the host range of p-crAssphage. Increased variation in tail fiber
genes was also found in an analysis of p-crAssphage genomes from South Africa32. The genes
that were least likely to have nonsynonymous multiallelic sites appear to be those that are
critical for phage function, such as “putative portal protein”, “putative major capsid protein” and
putative RNA polymerase subunits. Interestingly, some of these genes correspond to peaks in
the number of multiallelic sites detected, even though the variants had mostly synonymous
predicted effects. Infant samples have fewer multiallelic sites than mothers, with sites detected
in 33/88 genes. “Putative ssb single stranded DNA-binding protein” was the most enriched gene
for nonsynonymous multiallelic sites. Five out of ten tail fiber proteins had at least one
nonsynonymous multiallelic variant in infant samples, and the most frequently mutated tail fiber
gene was “putative phage tail-collar fiber protein (DUF3751),” a top hit in the adult samples
(Table S4).
P-crAssphage is the first described member of an expanding group of crAss-like phages.
Guerin et al.5 assembled 249 complete or near-complete crAss-like phage genomes out of
metagenomic sequencing datasets, which were then classified into 4 subfamilies (Alpha, Beta,
Gamma, Delta) and 10 clusters (1-10) based on shared protein coding genes. P-crAssphage is
a member of cluster Alpha 01. Given the observed sharing of p-crAssphage genome sequences
by mother-infant pairs, we were interested to determine if similar putative transmission events
could also be observed for crAss-like phages. We added the crAss-like genomes from Guerin et
al.5 to the Kraken2 viral reference database in a hierarchy following the proposed subfamily and
cluster designations (see Methods). For classification and transmission analyses, we carried out

analyses at the level of crAss-like phage clusters. A threshold of 1,000 reads classified to the
same cluster (roughy 1x coverage) was treated as evidence for presence.
Broadly, crAss-like phages are more frequently detected in the microbiome of mothers
and infants than p-crAssphage alone. 7/36 (19%) infants from Yassour et al.16 and 49/100
(49%) infants from Bäckhed et al.15 have at least one crAss-like cluster detected in at least one
sample. At least one cluster was detected in 33/43 (77%) and 88/100 (88%) of mothers from
each study. Mothers are most likely to be colonized by a single crAss-like phage cluster,
although we observe samples with up to 8 clusters detected (Figure S5). We do not observe
any crAss-like phage cluster present in infant samples taken within 24 hours of birth. However,
two infants from Bäckhed et al.15 have a crAss-like phage meeting the presence threshold in
samples collected as soon as 3 days after birth (samples 385_B and 633_B). This may
represent the lower time limit for the crAss-like phage and its bacterial hosts(s) to reach the
detection threshold.
The putative hosts of crAss-like phages, members of the Bacteroidetes phylum, are
known to be vertically transmitted15–17,26. Thus, we hypothesized that crAss-like phages would
be more frequently transmitted to vaginally vs. C-section born infants. We observed that all 19
p-crAssphage positive infants were delivered vaginally, while all C-section born infants
remained p-crAssphage negative for the duration of sampling. Although low sample numbers
prevented this association from raising to the level of significance when each cohort was tested
individually, it was significant when samples from both cohorts were considered together
(Bäckhed p=0.12, Yassour p=1, combined p=0.043). We also tested for associations in cases
where at least 10 infants were positive for a given crAss-like phage cluster. Presence of cluster
Delta 07 (Bäckhed p=0.009, Yassour p=1, combined p=0.007) and any crAss-like phage cluster
(Bäckhed p=0.004, Yassour p=0.32, combined p=0.001) was significantly associated with
vaginal delivery (Table S1). P-values were calculated with Fisher’s exact test and are

uncorrected for multiple hypothesis testing. No significant associations between crAss-like
phage presence and breastfeeding status were found.
Although a crAss-like phage similar to cluster Beta 06 phages was recently cultured on a
Bacteroides intestinalis host20, the hosts of other crAss-like phages have yet to be identified. We
searched for bacterial taxa that were differentially abundant between crAss-like phage positive
and negative infants to make inferences about potential hosts. Samples from vaginally born
infants at three or four months of age were included to allow comparisons across the two
studies at a similar time point. Bacterial relative abundances were transformed to centered logratios, and differential abundance was calculated with the R package ALDEx233 (see Methods).
P-values were calculated with the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and corrected for multiple
hypothesis testing34. Due to limited sample numbers, we considered presence of any crAss-like
phage as a group.
At the genus level, Collinsella was the most enriched taxon in infants positive for any
crAss-like phage (corrected p=0.0167) (Figure S6, Table S6). Several members of the
Collinsella genus, including Collinsella aerofaciens (corrected p=0.0239) were also the most
enriched species in these infants. Certain species of the genus Bacteroides were also
significantly enriched to a lesser degree, such as Bacteroides massiliensis (corrected
p=0.0499). Collinsella is a member of Actinobaceria, an entirely different phylum than the
posited Bacteroidetes hosts4. Collinsella was previously identified as a signature of the
developing anaerobic infant microbiome15, but further work is necessary to determine if these
species have a direct or indirect influence on the acquisition of crAss-like phages.
Next, we searched for putative mother-infant transmission of crAss-like phages.
Depending on the cluster, 0-16 families (median 2.5, SD=5.1) have the same crAss-like phage
cluster detected in at least one mother and matched infant sample (Table S5). We extended the
metagenomic assembly analysis above, using a pangenome compiled from all crAss-like
genomes in each cluster in place of the p-crAssphage reference. We find cases where mothers

and infants share an assembled genome with >99.7% identity and at least 20kb of aligned
sequence in 7/10 clusters. As expected, candidate transmission events in cluster Alpha 01
matched p-crAssphage. Overall, we observe putative transmission in 21/42 (50%) cases where
mother and infant have the same crAss-like phage cluster (Table S5). In two families, we
observed putative transmission of two separate crAss-like phage clusters. 50% is likely an
underestimate of the true transmission rate, because many comparisons were limited by low
sequencing depth and poorly assembled draft genomes. Interestingly, a subset of infants have a
crAss-like phage but their mothers do not. This could be due to waxing/waning amounts of
crAss-like phages in mothers, as has been described in adults14. If this is the case, the crAsslike phage may have been present in the mother at a level lower than our limit of detection and
thus may have been transmitted to the baby. Alternatively, the baby may have acquired the
crAss-like phage from an altogether different source, such as another housemate or
environmental source.
Another example of a perturbation where the gut microbiome, typically stable in adults,
may acquire a large number of new microbes is when individuals experience infection with the
gut pathogen Clostridium difficile, are treated with antibiotics, and subsequently receive fecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT)35,36. Draper et al.37 found that p-crAssphage relative
abundance is decreased in individuals with recurrent C. difficile infection and that p-crAssphage
could be transplanted from donor to recipient. However, strain-level transmission of pcrAssphage has not been explored in this patient population. We examined metagenomic
sequencing data from Smillie et al.35 and viral metagenomic sequencing data from Draper et
al.37 using the classification, assembly and comparison methods described above.
In the data from Smillie et al.35, we detect p-crAssphage at ≥1x coverage in samples
from two donors, MGH06D and MGH03D (Table S1). 12 patients received stool preparations
from either of those two donors. After FMT, 8/11 (73%) patients who received material from
donor MGH03D were positive for p-crAssphage, while the individual who received material from

donor MGH06D remained negative (Figure 5a). Zero recipients who received FMT from a pcrAssphage-negative donor acquired p-crAssphage during the sampling period. We compared
assembled p-crAssphage genomes from donors and recipients and found > 99.8% identical
sequences in samples from MGH03D and recipients of this donor’s material, while samples
from donor MGH06D had a distinct p-crAssphage sequence (96.7% identity to MGH03D)
(Figure S7). Interestingly, individuals MGH11R and MGH12R experienced dynamic pcrAssphage presence, with the phage falling below and rising above the detection limit in
subsequent samples. The assembled genomes remained highly similar in each case,
suggesting a waxing/waning p-crAssphage population in individual MGH12R, who did not
receive an additional FMT. In pre-FMT samples from recipients from this study, p-crAssphage
was not detected, and only one sample was positive for a single crAss-like phage (Table S1).
This suggests the phages are substantially diminished in abundance when individuals are
treated with drugs such as metronidazole, which has high activity against Bacteroides species.
Draper et al.37 specifically sequenced the amplified viral content of the metagenome, so
we adjusted the detection threshold to 10,000 reads (10x coverage) to reduce the number of
false positives. P-crAssphage was detected in all 16 samples from donor D3 and 0/17 samples
from donors D1 and D2. No pre-FMT samples from C. difficile colitis affected patients were
positive for p-crAssphage or any crAss-like phage (Table S1). 7/7 patients who received FMT
from donor D3 material became p-crAssphage positive; most remained positive for the 12
month duration of sampling (Figure 5b). Assembled p-crAssphage genomes from donor D3 and
the seven recipients had >99.5% nucleotide identity, suggesting colonization with the specific
donor p-crAssphage strain (Figure S8). Patient P7 became p-crAssphage positive with a
genome ~92% identical to the other donor and patients. P7 received material from donor D1,
who was p-crAssphage negative, and therefore could have acquired the phage from a
population below the detection limit in the donor or another source following re-establishment of
host bacterial populations. Patient P13 had p-crAssphage present at ~40x in a single sample,

but the assembled genome only had a total length of 12kb and N50 of 2.8kb. Samples with
lower coverage assembled nearly complete p-crAssphage genomes with N50 >60kb. It is thus
possible that P13’s p-crAssphage detection is an artifact of PCR amplification that is often used
in the sequencing of virus-enriched samples. These data show that p-crAssphage is frequently
and efficiently transplanted via FMT and that p-crAssphage can stably engraft in FMT recipients
for up to one year.

Discussion
The in silico discovery of p-crAssphage and recent publication of hundreds of crAss-like
phage genomes has highlighted the diversity and global prevalence of these phages in human
gut microbiomes. CrAss-like phages have even been found in non-human primates14,
suggesting these phages have been evolving alongside humans for millions of years. However,
it is currently unknown when and how an individual typically acquires crAss-like phages, as well
as what level of strain diversity exists within the microbiome of an individual. The datasets
examined here15,16 contain mother-infant pairs sampled extensively during the first year of life
and represent a unique opportunity to answer these questions.
We first characterized p-crAssphage and found no samples collected from infants within
24h of birth met our 1x coverage threshold. P-crAssphage becomes increasingly prevalent as
infants age, but does not reach the levels found in mothers by one year of life. The host(s) of pcrAssphage may not be present or have reached sufficient abundance in some infants by the
end of sample collection. Infants acquire many of their gut bacteria through direct transmission
from their mother, while gut viromes have been shown to remain unique between family
members and twins38. In contrast to other members of the gut virome, we found nearly identical
assembled p-crAssphage genomes in 6/10 cases where mothers and infants both harbor the
phage, suggesting vertical transmission. However, we cannot rule out alternative possibilities,
such as transmission from a different family member or from a common environmental source.
We also observed cases where mothers and infants had unrelated p-crAssphage genomes and
cases where infants had p-crAssphage but it was undetectable in the mother, which argue that
the infants acquired p-crAssphage from an undetectable population in the mother or from
another source.
It is currently unknown if individuals are typically colonized by a single or multiple pcrAssphage strains, or how similar or different these strains may be. We characterized the strain

diversity of the p-crAssphage population in an individual by examining positions in the pcrAssphage genome where we detected multiple high-quality alleles. We found most mothers
have a limited number of variable sites, with a median frequency of 0.04% across the 97kb pcrAssphage genome, arguing that most mothers have a limited diversity of p-crAssphage
strains. We did observe one mother with 100x more frequent variable sites, however. Infants
generally have an order of magnitude fewer variable sites than mothers, suggesting a
population that is further reduced in strain diversity, which may be the result of a bottleneck
event upon acquisition or transmission. P-crAssphage is significantly less diverse than the
second most abundant phage in these samples, Lactococcus phages 16802, where variable
sites are detected with a median frequency of 5.9%. In cases where we observed putative
mother-infant transmission, major alleles in the mother are primarily found in the infant,
suggesting the mother’s dominant strain is primarily responsible for colonizing the infant. The pcrAssphage population in infants develops additional variable sites over time, often at positions
where only single alleles were detected in the mother. This could be due to the different
bacterial hosts, nutritional sources and selective pressures in the infant microbiome, or simply
due to random mutations.
In the most reductionist sense, two p-crAssphage genomes could differ at a single
position and be considered different strains. However, we are most interested in strain variation
that has functional consequences for the phage, its host or other members of the gut
microbiome. Strain diversity in the p-crAssphage population of mothers is enriched for variants
with predicted synonymous effects. However, we do observe enrichment for nonsynonymous
(i.e. functional) variants in key genes, including predicted tail fiber proteins. This suggests that
there may be a benefit to maintaining nonsynonymous allelic diversity in these genes, such as
the ability to infect a broader range of hosts. One isolated crAss-like phage20 was noted to have
a very specific host range, so variation in tail fiber genes may allow these phage to infect an
increased range of bacteria. Laboratory experiments are necessary to further investigate this

hypothesis, but could use exiting variation in the tail genes as a starting point to screen for
expanded host range. P-crAssphage in infants has variable sites that are enriched for
synonymous changes compared to mothers, but limited sample numbers made it difficult to
determine enrichment for specific genes.
P-crAssphage is the first described member of a diverse group of crAss-like phages5,
with four “family” level and ten “genus” level classifications. Similar to p-crAssphage, we
observe a trend of increasing prevalence with infant age for many clusters of crAss-like phages.
Some clusters, such as Alpha 03, are prevalent in mothers but rarely or never observed in
infants, suggesting the hosts of these phages have yet to reach sufficient abundance in the
infant microbiome. We first observe a crAss-like phage at 1x coverage in samples collected
three days after birth. In the case of family 633, the mother and three-day old infant have a
Delta 07 phage with 99.3% alignment identity. Since we did not observe such early potential
transmission events with p-crAssphage, this may represent the first detectable transmission of
any crAss-like phage from mother to infant, and a lower limit for the time for a crAss-like phage
to colonize the infant microbiome. Alternatively, crAss-like phages may not colonize the infant
microbiome at such an early time, rather, they may be acquired through routes other than actual
parturition. For example, the phages might be present in yet understudied niches, such as the
mother’s breast milk or the shared built environment of the baby and mother. Of note,
Bacteroides species, which are posited to be the natural host of p-crAssphage and are known to
be the host of a crAss-like phage20 have previously been detected in breast milk39. Overall, we
find nearly identical genomes in 50% of cases when we detect the same cluster crAss-like
phage in both mother and infant, suggesting a transmission rate similar to p-crAssphage.
Regardless of the crAssphage status of the mother, we found a strong association of pcrAssphage and crAss-like phage presence with vaginal delivery, in contrast to what has been
described previously7. One potential explanation is that vaginal birth is responsible for
transmitting the phage from mother to infant. However, this is less likely in cases where infants

harbor a phage undetected in the mother. Another possible explanation is that vaginal birth is
responsible for seeding bacteria necessary for later colonization by crAss-like phages. Previous
research found maternal seeding of bacteria from the class Bacteroidia was inhibited by Csection birth, supporting this hypothesis24,40. Future research with more balanced cohorts will
likely clarify whether or not birth mode affects crAss-like phage acquisition and transmission.
Unexpectedly, microbiomes of vaginally-born infants positive for crAss-like phages were
strongly enriched in Collinsella species. It is doubtful that this finding suggests new hosts for
crAss-like phages, rather, Collinsella may be a hallmark for a developing and increasingly
anaerobic infant microbiome that is capable of harboring these phages.
Finally, we observe that p-crAssphage is frequently transmitted via fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) and can engraft stably in FMT recipients for up to one year. Engraftment
of bacteria and phages has been well-studied in the case of FMT treatment for recurrent
Clostridium difficile infection, and transplantation of p-crAssphage has been identified
previously35–37. Our strain-level findings add new insight into the transmission of lytic
bacteriophages. We assembled nearly identical genomes from both donors and recipients,
highly suggestive of transmission of the specific p-crAssphage strain. Taken together, the
results from both populations suggest that infants and patients receiving FMT have relatively
unpopulated, naive microbiomes, providing an open niche for p-crAssphage to engraft into.
While this study suggests new principles about acquisition and transmission of crAss-like
phages in the gut microbiome, it does have several limitations. First, we examined publicly
available metagenomic data and were therefore limited to the available study cohort and sample
size. In the mother-infant studies, stool samples were not collected from family members other
than mothers, which could help determine other contributions to crAss-like phage acquisition in
infants. Also, many infant birth samples were limited by low sequencing depth. As such, the
estimates for acquisition and transmission presented here are likely underestimates. Sampling
time points, processing techniques and study populations were different between the two

studies, although both were conducted in Northern European individuals. Second, short-read
sequencing data limited our ability to phase strain variants in the p-crAssphage genome. If the
samples were resequenced with long-read sequencing approaches41, we could obtain single
reads spanning many variable sites. This would allow us to determine if the observed variants
are the result of a smaller number of more divergent strain populations, or a high number of
closely related strains. Finally, our group has become aware of false positive strain sharing
results due to “barcode swapping” in dual-indexed Illumina sequencing libraries generated in
our lab, which was first described in 201742. As the indexing strategy was not reported for the
public data we analyzed in this manuscript, we cannot be certain that the findings presented are
not the result of this artifact. However, we believe our results, where only matched mother-infant
pairs and matched FMT donor-recipient pairs share highly related crAss-like phage sequences,
are unlikely to be explained by barcode swapping alone. The detrimental effect of barcode
swapping also highlights the importance of reporting index sequences as a key part of making
data publicly available.
Future work expanding on our findings should be directed towards answering several
important questions. How stable are crAss-like phages transmitted from mother to infant over
time? Are they lifelong inhabitants that, barring heavy antibiotic use, can be transmitted for
generations? Are there exclusion principles that prevent the acquisition of a second, more
divergent p-crAssphage strain? Additionally, our strain diversity analysis focused on pcrAssphage, but a wealth of diversity is also present in crAss-like phages. Better genome
annotations and more concrete principles surrounding the identity and taxonomy of crAss-like
phages will enable this research, and isolating, culturing and characterizing new crAss-like
phages is a key next step. Finally, long-read metagenomic sequencing will enable better
analysis of the strain populations among crAss-like phages in the mixed community of the
microbiome. The ubiquity, distinct genome composition and ease of computational analysis with
crAss-like phages may render them useful models for querying microbial transmission more

broadly. Future work remains to determine precisely whether, and how, crAss-like phages
influence the gut ecosystem and ultimately human health.

Methods
Sequence read preprocessing
Raw sequencing reads from Bäckhed et al.15 and Yassour et al.16 were downloaded from SRA
from each sample and preprocessed in a consistent way: TrimGalore version 0.5.043 was used
to perform quality and adapter trimming with the flags ‘--clip_R1 15 --clip_R2 15 --length 60’.
SeqKit version 0.9.144 was used to remove duplicates with the command ‘seqkit rmdup --byseq’. Reads were mapped against the human genome using BWA version 0.7.17-r118845 and
only unmapped reads were retained. Many infant samples at birth had low read counts after
preprocessing, and samples with fewer than 10,000 reads were removed from all subsequent
analyses. This left 135 families with sufficient depth in at least one sample from mother and
infant.

Kraken2 classification
For classification of p-crAssphage, we built a Kraken221 database containing all bacteria, viral
and fungal genomes in NCBI GenBank assembled to complete genome, chromosome or
scaffold quality as of February 2019. Human and mouse reference genomes were also included
in the database. A Bracken46 database was also built with a read length of 150 and kmer length
of 35. P-crAssphage is represented by a 97kb genome (accession NC_024711.1). Multiple
crAss-like phages are present in GenBank and would cause reads mapping to multiple
genomes to be classified at the least common ancestor of “crAss-like viruses.” To prevent this
from happening, other crAss-like genomes were removed from the database.

For classification of crAss-like phages, we added to the viral database, replacing the original
“crAss-like viruses” clade with genomes in the proposed subfamily and cluster hierarchy

described in Guerin et al.5. Kraken2 was used with default classification parameters on pairedend reads.

For testing associations between crAss-like phage presence and other bacterial taxa, reads
were classified by using Kraken2 with default parameters on paired-end reads, and Bracken
was used for abundance estimation with the parameters ‘-r 150 -l S -t 10’

Assembling and comparing crAss-like phage genomes
Preprocessed sequencing reads were assembled with SPAdes version 3.13.147 using the ‘-meta’ flag. Contigs ≥500bp were aligned with BWA against either the p-crAsspahge reference
genome or composite genomes from all the crAss-like phages in a cluster from Guerin et al.5.
Resulting contigs were assessed for their N50 and total assembly length. Pairwise comparisons
were conducted with nucmer version 4.0.0beta248 and the average identity and total length of 11 aligned segments was reported. The heatmap in Figure 1 was clustered on the euclidean
distance between samples with the ward.d2 clustering method and plotted with the heatmap.2
function in the gplots package for R49.

SNPs and multiallelic sites
SNPs were called with Snippy50 with freebayes51 as the variant caller using the p-crAssphage
reference at sites covered ≥10x. Filtering, decomposition and normalization of variants was
necessary to compare between samples and was conducted with vt version 0.552 and bcftools
version 1.953. The output of snippy, snps.raw.vcf, was used in this command: “vt decompose -s
snps.raw.vcf | vt decompose_blocksub -a - | bcftools norm -f crassphage_reference.fasta -m any | bcftools view --include 'QUAL≥100 && FMT/DP≥10 && (FMT/AO)/(FMT/DP)≥0'”. We

calculated the transition/transversion ratio of detected variants using vcftools54 version 0.1.16.
Considering all detected variants agnostic of samples, the transition/transversion ratio is 2.91 for
all SNPs, 2.41 for fixed SNPs after variant decomposition and 2.42 for multiallelic SNPs at >0.1
AF after variant decomposition. Considering samples individually, the median Ts/Tv ratios are
3.40, 2.80 and 3.23 (SD=2.3, 1.5, 3.4), respectively. The median sample numbers are higher
because of samples with few detected transversions producing a comparatively high ratio.

To compare fixed SNPs between samples, we only consider sites covered ≥10x in both
samples. The reported SNP % identity is 1 - (the number of fixed SNPs different between
samples / number of sites covered ≥10x in both samples).

Multiallelic sites were called as sites with two alleles and ≥5 reads supporting each allele. We
report a normalized statistic (Fmulti) to compare multiallelic sites across samples with highly
variable coverage. At a given minor allele fraction(AF), Fmulti is the proportion of multiallelic sites
with a minor AF > x among those sites covered well enough to detect a minor AF of x. Effects of
multiallelic variants were predicted with SnpEff version 4.327 using the p-crAssphage genome
annotation available on GenBank and the flags `ann -noLog -noStats -no-downstream -noupstream -no-utr -t`. When mothers had multiple samples, we used the one with the highest pcrAssphage coverage for multiallelic site analysis.

CrAss-like phage correlation with bacterial abundance
We used the outputs of Bracken to test for differential abundances in taxa between groups.
Matrices of reads classified to each taxa in each sample were filtered to keep only taxa with an
abundance of at least 0.001 and nonzero values in at least 30% of samples. Zeros in the data
were replaced with the Geometric Bayesian multiplicative method in the zCompositions version

1.3.2-1 package for R55. Differential abundance between groups was calculated with the
ALDEx2 version 1.16.0 package for R33.

FMT data analysis
Data from the FMT studies35,37 were processed, assembled and compared in the same way as
mother/infant data. Sample MGH06R35 was excluded from the FMT cohort analysis as it could
not be definitively determined whether sample designated as pre-FMT was actually collected
prior to transplantation (personal communication with authors).

Data availability
All data analyzed in this study are publicly available. We have deposited the p-crAssphage and
crAss-like phage assembled genomes as a supplementary file along with this manuscript.

at least ten mother and infant samples. This best represented member of this group,
Lactococcus phage 16802, was detected in 34 samples and has more multiallelic sites than pcrAssphage on average, with a median of 58.8 multiallelic sites per kb.
