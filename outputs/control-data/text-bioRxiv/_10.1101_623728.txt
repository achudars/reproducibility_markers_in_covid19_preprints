ABSTRACT
Dietary intake, a major contributor to the global obesity epidemic1–5, is a
complex phenotype partially affected by innate physiological processes.6–11
However, previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have only
implicated a few loci in variability of dietary composition.12–14 Here, we present a
multi-trait genome-wide association meta-analysis of inter-individual variation in
dietary intake in 283,119 European-ancestry participants from UK Biobank and
CHARGE consortium, and identify 96 genome-wide significant loci. Dietary intake
signals map to different brain tissues and are enriched for genes expressed in b1tanycytes and serotonergic and GABAergic neurons. We also find enrichment of
biological pathways related to neurogenesis. Integration of cell-line and brainspecific epigenomic annotations identify 15 additional loci. Clustering of genomewide significant variants yields three main genetic clusters with distinct
associations with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Overall, these results
enhance biological understanding of dietary composition, highlight neural
mechanisms, and support functional follow-up experiments.

As dietary components are strongly correlated, we conducted a multi-trait genomewide association meta-analysis of overall variation in dietary intake among 283,119
European-ancestry participants from the UK Biobank15 and the Cohorts for Heart and
Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium14 (Methods;
Supplementary Table 1). First, we conducted single-trait GWAS for the proportion of
total energy intake from carbohydrate, fat, and protein in UK Biobank (n=192,005).
Next, single-trait GWAS from the UK Biobank and CHARGE Consortium (n=91,114)
were meta-analyzed and combined into a multi-trait genome-wide association metaanalysis (Methods). An analysis overview is presented in Supplementary Fig. 1.
We evaluated dietary intake using 24-hour web-based diet recall in the UK
Biobank16,17 and validated food frequency questionnaires, diet history and diet records
in the CHARGE Consortium.14 We observed strong genome-wide genetic correlations
for nutrient estimates between the UK Biobank and CHARGE datasets (rg >0.6 for all; P
<0.001; Supplementary Table 2). The quantile-quantile plots of single-trait and multi-trait
meta-analyses showed moderate inflation (lGC ranging from 1.12 to 1.17) with a linkage
disequilibrium (LD) score intercept18 of ~1 (standard error (s.e.) = 0.01), indicating that
most inflation could be explained by polygenic signal (Supplementary Fig. 2,
Supplementary Table 3). In single-trait meta-analyses, genome-wide SNP-based
heritability19 was estimated at 3.9% (s.e.=0.01), 2.8% (s.e.=0.01), and 3.0% (s.e.=0.01)
for carbohydrate, fat, and protein, respectively (Supplementary Table 3), in line with
previous GWAS findings12,14 and other behavioral phenotypes such as tobacco or
alcohol use.20

In the multi-trait meta-analysis, 156 lead variants in 96 distinct genomic loci reached
genome-wide significance (Methods, Fig. 1a, Supplementary Dataset, Supplementary
Tables 4,5). Single-trait meta-analyses of carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake identified
10, 8, and 9 genome-wide significant loci, respectively (Supplementary Tables 6-8). To
account for potential reverse causation effects, we investigated whether individuals at
extreme quartiles of genetic risk for body mass index (BMI), T2D, or coronary artery
disease (CAD) reported different dietary composition (Methods). We found no evidence
of such effects, except for individuals with higher number of BMI risk alleles that
reported higher protein intake (Supplementary Table 9). In BMI-adjusted multi-trait
meta-analysis, 88 out of 96 identified signals retained genome-wide significance
(Supplementary Table 10).
Functional annotation of all candidate variants in associated loci (n=12,675 variants;
Methods) identified 67 nonsynonymous variants among them (Fig. 1, Supplementary
Tables 5, 11), five of which were the lead variants at their respective locus (Table 1).
Several genes in Table 1 have been previously associated with dietary phenotypes,
neurological processes, and cardiometabolic risk factors (Supplementary Table 12). For
example, the nonsynonymous variant rs4975017 in KLB, which encodes the β-Klotho, a
primary ‘zip code’-like receptor for endocrine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)
signaling, may impair the affinity between β-Klotho and FGF2121. FGF21’s relevance
for eating behavior has enabled the development of a drug found to reduce sugar intake
and sweet taste preference when administered to monkeys and humans with
obesity.22,23 A common missense mutation in rs601338 results in a premature stop
codon in the exon 2 of the fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) gene. FUT2 regulates

expression of H group antigens on the surface of epithelial cells,24 but also affects
vitamin B12 and folate pathways,25 and is associated with multiple complex phenotypes
such as inflammation,26,27 cognitive decline,28 and lipids levels.29
We next tested dietary intake signals for enrichment of gene expression in 53 tissue
types obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project30 and in 10,651
predefined gene sets derived from MSigDB31 (Methods). Signals were significantly
enriched for genes predominantly expressed in several brain tissues including the
cerebellum (P=1.1×10-6), frontal cortex (P=2.9×10-5), anterior cingulate cortex
(P=1.3×10-4), nucleus accumbens (P=2.6×10-4), and hypothalamus (P=9.5×10-4) (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Table 13). These findings support the notion that dietary intake is, at
least, partially controlled by the central nervous system including areas that are known
to influence energy homeostasis and appetite control. Two gene sets were significantly
enriched for association with dietary intake including neurogenesis (P=2.6×10-7), and
nuclear translocation (P=2.3×10-6) (Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables 14-15).
To evaluate whether the genomic loci implicated in dietary intake map onto specific
brain cell types, we used two independent brain single-cell RNA sequencing datasets
(Methods).32,33 Cell-type-specific gene expression in 24 mouse-derived brain cell types
showed a significant enrichment for dietary intake genomic loci in genes expressed in
serotonergic (P=4.1×10-5) and embryonic GABAergic neurons (P=1.9×10-4) (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Table 16). Given that several subtypes of serotonergic and embryonic
GABAergic neurons have been recently identified in and around the adult mouse
hypothalamic arcuate-median eminence complex nucleus (Arc-ME),10,32 we used celltype-specific gene expression in 50 transcriptionally distinct cell populations in the Arc-

ME (Methods). We identified enrichment of dietary-linked gene expression in b1
tanycytes (P=2.9×10-3), but not in other neuronal subpopulations (Fig. 2d,
Supplementary Table 17). Tanycytes are a specialized type of ependymal cell lining the
wall of the third ventricle with a variety of functions including neurogenesis or controlling
the chemical exchange between brain parenchyma, cerebrospinal fluid, and
bloodstream.34–36 In addition to the dietary intake associated signals, b1 tanycytes were
enriched for the expression of genes previously associated with lipids (ABCG5, APOB)
and growth factor (FGF18) (Supplementary Table 17).
We next investigated whether the integration of genomic annotations from several
cell lines and brain tissues could identify additional relevant genetic associations
influencing dietary intake. We used fGWAS,37 a hierarchical modeling approach to reweight association estimates by using information from the most relevant functional
annotations (Methods). By combining separate statistically significant annotations and
applying model selection and cross-validation, we showed that the most relevant
annotations for dietary intake were DNase I hypersensitivity sites in fetal brain
(log2 enrichment of 1.22, 95%CI: 0.28 to 1.93), repressed chromatin in B cells (-0.71,
95%CI: -1.22 to -0.17), and weak enhancers in epithelial cells (2.50, 95%CI: 1.23 to
3.39) (Supplementary Tables 18-19). We then used parameters from this model as
priors to re-weight the multi-trait meta-analysis, and identified 15 additional genomic
regions with high-confidence associations (posterior probability of association [PPA] >
0.8) only when the model incorporated information from functional annotations (Fig. 3,
Supplementary Table 20). These additional signals comprised sub genome-wide
signals, and underscored genetic and functional links between dietary intake and neural

mechanisms. For example, the model identified a rare variant in rs76094283 (MAF =
0.0002 [imputation quality score =0.8]) as the most likely candidate to be the causal
variant in the GDNF family receptor alpha 2 (GFRA2) locus. The variant achieved a
PPA = 0.86 and showed suggestive evidence of association with increased fat intake
with concomitant reduced carbohydrate and protein intake (P=4.3×10-7). The identified
variant lies in the transcription start site of the GFRA2 gene, which encodes the
neurturin receptor implicated in neuron differentiation and survival.38,39 GFRalpha2knockout mice display significant impairments in the parasympathetic and enteric
nervous system, reduction in body weight, and memory of taste aversions, highlighting
the importance of this molecular complex for eating behavior and nervous system
development and function.40,41
To group the identified genome-wide significant loci into clusters with potential
clinical similarities, we implemented a Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization
(bNMF) clustering algorithm (Methods).42–44 We aligned variants by their alleles
associated with increased proportion of fat intake and their respective associations with
22 other dietary traits (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 21). The
defining features of each identified cluster were determined by the most highly
associated traits and variants after running 1,000 iterations. In 65% of the iterations, the
data converged onto three clusters denoting different dietary composition patterns. In
addition to increased proportion of fat intake in all clusters, cluster 1 was characterized
by increased energy intake (“hyper caloric”), cluster 2 was driven by reduced proportion
of protein and carbohydrate intake (“reduced carbohydrate and protein diet”), and
cluster 3 was determined by increased proportion of protein intake (“increased protein

diet”). Additional traits and defining loci for each cluster are described in Supplementary
Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 22-23. In exploratory analyses, when aligning dietary
intake variants for increased proportion of carbohydrate intake instead, clusters retained
similar overall patterns.
We used the set of strongest-weighted variants from each cluster to generate
partitioned polygenic scores (PPSs) (Methods). We first confirmed that PPSs were
significantly associated with traits defining each cluster (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 3,
Supplementary Table 24). We next assessed PPSs associations with BMI, T2D, and
CAD in the UK Biobank. In the UK Biobank, the PPSs for clusters 2 (“reduced
carbohydrate and protein diet”) and 3 (“increased protein diet”) were each associated
with lower BMI with adjusted estimated effect sizes of -0.03 kg/m2 (SE=0.01, P=6.9×108

) and -0.03 kg/m2 (SE=0.01, P=1.2×10-16) per allele increase in the PPS, respectively

(Fig. 4). The PPS for the “increased protein diet” was associated with lower T2D with an
adjusted estimated odds ratio of 0.97 (95%CI: 0.96 to 0.99; P=4.0×10-4) per allele
increase in the PPS. We detected no association with CAD. To replicate findings from
the UK Biobank, we further used data from the Partners Healthcare Biobank (n
=19,563), an independent hospital-based biobank (Methods).45 In the Partners
Healthcare Biobank, we noted a similar nominal association between the “reduced
carbohydrate and protein diet” cluster and obesity (0.97, 95%CI: 0.95 to 0.99; P=0.02)
and between the “increased protein diet” cluster and T2D (0.95, 95%CI: 0.91 to 0.99;
P=0.01). Overall, these findings suggest that dietary patterns characterized by
increased fat in combination with reduced carbohydrate intake may be associated with

lower BMI, and that the combination of increased fat and protein intake may associated
with lower T2D risk, but residual confounding may still exist.
In the present study, we have expanded the genetic landscape of dietary intake by
increasing the number of genome-wide significant loci from three to 96. Our findings
provide insights into biological mechanisms that influence dietary intake, highlighting the
relevance of brain-expressed genes, brain cell types, and central nervous system
processes. Our results align with findings from tissue expression and gene-set
enrichment analyses of BMI-associated loci that pinpoint the central nervous system as
a critical regulator of energy homeostasis and body weight.46,47 A novel finding from this
study is the enrichment of dietary intake associated signals for genes expressed in b1tanycytes. Morphological studies have mapped b1-tanycytes on the floor and ventral
parts of the third ventricle in the median eminence complex of the hypothalamus.32,48
Animal studies suggest that b1-tanycytes are nutrient and metabolite sensors that
impact upon the blood-hypothalamus barrier plasticity and neuronal function.34,49,50 In
this context, we also showed that b1-tanycytes are enriched for expression of genes
previously associated with lipid homeostasis and growth factor, thus providing a strong
cellular candidate for future studies. The multi-trait approach allowed us to leverage the
observed genetic correlations among nutrients to increase power for locus discovery, as
has been the case for other correlated traits.51–53 The bNMF clustering algorithm
enabled us to dissect dietary intake genetic heterogeneity and identify three main
domains of genetic variants that may have distinct impacts on obesity and T2D. Our
findings, in line with previous evidence,54 may suggest that increasing proportion of fat
intake in place of protein and carbohydrate associates with lower BMI. In addition, the

combination of increased proportion of fat and protein intake associates with lower BMI
and lower T2D risk. These findings are likely unaffected by the possibility that
individuals at high BMI, T2D, or CAD genetic risk may have made changes in their diet,
yet considering the complex network of biological and non-biological determinants of
dietary intake, caution must be exercised in drawing strong conclusions.
Because the present study was limited to self-reported dietary intake, more precise
measurements, including evaluating age and social, cultural, and economic factors as
mediators or effect modifiers of a dynamic phenotype such as dietary intake may help
refine our findings. In addition, expanding these analyses to non-European ancestries is
warranted to determine the generalizability of the identified signals. Nonetheless, the
present findings provide a starting point for understanding the biological variability of a
complex and disease-relevant behavior, and provide specific supportive evidence for
functional research that will aid in the discovery of mechanisms by which associated
genes may affect dietary intake and related cardiometabolic risk.

Samples
UK Biobank
The UK Biobank is a large population-based study established primarily to allow
detailed investigations of the genetic and lifestyle determinants of a wide range of
phenotypes.15 Data from >500,000 participants living in the United Kingdom who were
aged 40-69 and living <25 miles from a study center were invited to participate between
2006-2010. We used data released in July 2017, and filtering (described below) resulted
in a final sample size of 192,005 participants of European ancestry with dietary intake
data. The UK Biobank received ethical approval from the National Research Ethics
Service Committee North West Haydock (reference 11/NW/0382), and all study
procedures were performed in accordance with the World Medical Association for
medical research. The current study was conducted under UK Biobank application
27892.
CHARGE Consortium
The CHARGE Consortium was formed to facilitate GWAS among multiple large
cohort studies.55 We used summary statistics of dietary composition from the CHARGE
dietary composition GWAS (CHARGE; see URLs (to be added when available)) on 24
discovery cohorts which included up to 91,114 participants of European ancestry.14 All
included studies were approved by local ethic committees, and informed consent was
obtained from all the participants.

UK Biobank
In the UK Biobank, dietary data were collected from 211,036 participants using the
Oxford WebQ, a web-based 24-hr diet recall that asks participants to self-report on the
frequency of intake of about 200 commonly consumed foods and drinks from the
preceding 24 hours.16,17 The recall was administered at baseline visits in-person at

and later administered electronically by email on four separate occasions over a 16month period (Feb 2011 - April 2012) to ~320,000 participants with known email
addresses. Email invitations were sent on variable days of the week in order to capture
variability in daily dietary intake. Daily nutrient composition was estimated by multiplying
the quantity consumed of each food or drink by the known nutrient composition as
derived from the UK food composition database McCance and Widdowson’s The
Composition of Foods and its supplements.56 The following analysis was limited to total
energy (f.100002) and macronutrients intake (in grams per day; excluding supplements)
of carbohydrate (f.100005), total fat (f.100004), and protein (f.100003). Recalls with
improbable estimated total energy <500 or >4,000 kcal per day were excluded. For
~66% of the 211,036 participants who completed more than one recall, averages of
each macronutrient were calculated as suggested elsewhere.57

habitual nutrient consumption was estimated. Over-reporters and under-reporters were
excluded by standard cut-offs determined by each study cohort as part of quality
control.12
Genotyping and quality control
UK Biobank
We used genotype data released by the UK Biobank in July 2017. The genotype
data collection, quality control, and imputation procedures are described elsewhere.58 In
short, 489,212 participants were genotyped on two customized genetic arrays (the UK
BiLEVE Axiom array [n = 50,520] and the UK Biobank Axiom array [n = 438,692])
covering 812,428 unique genetic markers (95% overlap in variant content). Quality
control procedures were conducted by the UK Biobank. Samples were removed for high
missingness or heterozygosity (968 samples) and sex chromosome abnormalities (652
samples). Variants were tested for batch effects (197 variants/batch), plate effects (284
variants/batch), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (572 variants/batch), sex effects (45
variants/batch), array effects (5,417 genetic variants), and discordance across control
replicates (622 on UK BiLEVE Axiom array and 632 UK Biobank Axiom array) (P<10-12
or <95% for all tests). For each batch (106 batches total) markers that failed at least one
test were set to missing. Before imputation, 488,377 individuals and 805,426 SNPs
pass QC in at least one batch (>99% of the array content). Genotypes were phased and
imputed by the coordinating team to approximately 96 million genetic variants by using
a combined reference panel, including the Haplotype Reference Consortium and the
UK10K haplotype panel. Imputed and quality-controlled genotype data were available
for 487,422 individuals and 92,693,895 genetic variants. Population structure was

captured by principal component analysis on the samples using a subset of high quality
(missingness <1.5%), high frequency variants (>2.5%) (~100,000 genetic variants) and
identified the sub-sample of white British descent. We further clustered participants into
four ancestry clusters using K-means clustering on the principal components, identifying
453,964 participants of European ancestry included in the present analysis, of which
192,005 had available dietary intake data and thus remained in the final analysis.
CHARGE Consortium
Genotyping and quality control methods for the CHARGE Consortium dietary intake
GWAS has been detailed elsewhere.14 In brief, each participating cohort performed
quality control for genotyped variants based on minor allele frequency (MAF), call rate,
and departure from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Phased haplotypes from 1000G were
used to impute ~38 million autosomal variants using a Hidden Markov Model algorithm
implemented in MACH/minimac59,60 or SHAPEIT/IMPUTE.61,62 Variants with low minor
allele count (MAC<20) in the meta-analysis and low imputation quality (<0.4) were
removed. The number of autosomal genetic variants analyzed in this study was ~11.8
million.
Single-trait and multi-trait genome-wide association meta-analysis
In the UK Biobank, genetic association analyses were performed separately for
carbohydrate, fat, and protein as percentages of total energy in 192,005 participants
using BOLT-LMM linear mixed models and an additive genetic model adjusted for age,
sex, 10 principal components of ancestry, genotyping array and genetic correlation
matrix [jl2] with a maximum per SNP missingness of 10% and per sample missingness
of 40%.19 We used a minor allele frequency threshold of 0.001. In a second model, BMI

was added to the covariates to account for genetic effects mediated through body
composition.
To maximize the statistical power, we meta-analyzed the dietary intake GWAS in UK
Biobank and the CHARGE Consortium. Meta-analysis was performed using METAL by
weighting effect size estimates using the inverse of the corresponding standard errors
squared (version - released March 25 2011).63 The genetic signals correlated strongly
between the two samples supporting the meta-analysis genome-wide (rg>0.6 all P
<0.001; Supplementary Table 2). We assessed heterogeneity in genetic effects across
studies using the I2 heterogeneity index.64
Single-trait estimates for carbohydrate, fat, and protein from the meta-analyses were
combined in a multi-trait analysis using the cross-phenotype association software
(CPASSOC).65 In brief, CPASSOC uses summary-level data from single variant-trait
associations from GWAS to boost the statistical power for locus discovery by leveraging
the observed genetic correlation between traits. The joint analysis of multiple
phenotypes using CPASSOC provides two statistics, SHom and SHet. SHom is similar to
statistics generated by the fixed-effects meta-analysis method, but uses the sample size
for a trait as a weight instead of the variance and accounts for the correlation of
summary statistics among traits and studies induced by correlated traits, potential
overlapping or related samples. SHet is an extension of SHom that improves power when
the genetic effect sizes vary for different traits. The distribution of SHet values under the
null hypothesis of no association was obtained through an estimated beta distribution. In
a recent comparison of statistical power of 19 multivariate genome-wide association
methods, it was shown that SHet seems to benefit from the presence of opposite effect

estimates, which is relevant for dietary composition. In addition, Shet performed slightly
better when applied to highly correlated traits.66
Heritability and genetic correlation
Trait SNP-based heritability was calculated as the proportion of trait variance due to
additive genetic factors using BOLT-REML.19 Genomic control lambda (λGC) values
were calculated using GenABEL in R67 using post-quality control GWAS results. LD
Score regression was used to estimate the cross-cohort genetic correlations.18
Calculated linkage disequilibrium (LD) scores from 1000G European reference
population were obtained online (see URLs).
Genomic risk loci definition
Distinct associated loci from the meta- analysis were defined using the Functional
Mapping and Annotation FUMA platform68 (see URLs). We first defined distinct
significant genetic variants, which had a genome-wide significant P-value (P<5×10−8)
and were in low LD (r2<0.6). These variants were further represented by lead genetic
variants, which are a subset of the distinct significant variants that are in approximate
LD with each other at r2<0.1 (based on LD information from UK Biobank genotype data).
Subsequently, genomic risk loci were defined by merging lead variants that physically
overlapped or for which LD blocks were less than 250 kb apart. Borders of the
associated genomic loci were defined by identifying all variants in LD (r2≥0.6) with one
of the distinct significant variants in the locus, and a region containing all of these
candidate variants was considered to be a single distinct genomic locus.

To assess whether our findings were influenced by the possibility that individuals at
high metabolic risk had made changes to their diet (reverse causation), we investigated
the associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for BMI, T2D, and CAD with
macronutrient intake. Individual-level data from the UK Biobank were used to create
individual participant scores by summing the number of alleles at each genetic variant
weighted by the respective effect sizes on BMI, T2D, and CAD based on estimated
effect sizes from published meta-analyses of GWAS for BMI (n=339,224 individuals),46
T2D (n=74,124 T2D cases and 824,006 controls),69 and CAD (60,801 cases and
123,504 controls).70 We compared mean proportion of total energy intake from
carbohydrate, fat, and protein among quartiles of each PRS using analysis of variance.
Gene mapping and functional annotation
All genetic variants in the meta-analysis results that were in LD (r2>0.6) with one of
the distinct significant variant and that had P<5×10−8 and MAF > 0.0001 were mapped
to genes in FUMA using positional mapping, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)
mapping, and chromatin interaction mapping. Predicted functional consequences for
identified variants were obtained from databases containing known functional
annotations, including ANNOVAR categories,71 Combined Annotation Dependent
Depletion (CADD) scores,72 RegulomeDB scores,73 and chromatin states.74,75
ANNOVAR categories identify the variants’ genic position and associated function.
CADD scores predict how deleterious the effect of a variant is likely to be for protein
structure/function, with higher scores referring to higher deleteriousness. The
RegulomeDB score is a categorical score based on information from eQTLs and
chromatin marks, ranging from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating an increased

accessibility of genomic regions with 15 categorical states predicted by a hidden Markov
model based on 5 chromatin marks for 127 epigenomes in the Roadmap Epigenomics
Project.75 A lower state indicates higher accessibility, with states 1-7 referring to open
chromatin states.
Tissue and gene-set enrichment analyses
We used multi-trait meta-analysis P-values as input for an enrichment analysis in 53
tissue types obtained from the Gene-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx)30 and 10,651
predefined gene-sets derived from MSigDB31 in MAGMA.76 For tissue enrichment
analyses, gene expression values are log2 transformed average RPKM per tissue type
after winsorized at 50 based on GTEx RNA-seq data. MAGMA was performed using the
result of gene analysis (gene-based P-value) and tested for one side (greater) with
conditioning on average expression across all tissue types. For gene-set enrichment we
tested for association in types of predefined gene sets representing known biological
functions and metabolic pathways derived from MSigDB.
Brain single-cell-expression analyses
To connect genomic loci implicated in dietary composition with the specific brain cell
types defined by gene expression profiles, we used two independent brain single-cell
RNA sequencing datasets. We first used information from 24 level 1 brain cell types
(level 1 clusters were characterized based on expression of known marker genes) and
149 level 2 brain cell types (subtypes of a level 1 grouping (for example, medium spiny
neurons expressing Drd1 or Drd2) from Skene et al.33 In brief, brain-cell-type expression
data were drawn from single-cell RNA-seq data from mouse brains. For each gene, the

value for each cell type was calculated by dividing the mean unique molecular identifier
(UMI) counts for the given cell type by the summed mean UMI counts across all cell
types. Single-cell gene sets were derived by grouping genes into 40 equal bins by
specificity of expression. These gene sets were tested for association with gene-based
test statistics using MAGMA.76
Given the relevance of the hypothalamic Arc-ME in energy homeostasis and
appetite control,10,32 we used Drop-seq data from 50 transcriptionally distinct Arc-ME
cell populations described in Campbell et al.32 Drop-seq data of mouse Arc-ME
(GSE93374) were averaged using the Seurat Average Expression function. Two
different levels of clustering were used: a coarser clustering across all identified cell
types shown and a finer-grained clustering limited to neuronal cell types as described.32
To account for droplet-specific differences in mRNA captures rates, we log-normalized
the averaged counts using the default Seurat “logNormalize” method. This divides each
observed expression value by the sum for that gene, multiplies by a scaling factor (here
the default, 10000), adds 1, and takes the natural log. Genes were mapped from mouse
gene symbols to mouse Ensembl gene identifiers (using Ensembl version 83) and to the
human Ensembl gene identifiers (using Ensembl version 82). Mouse gene identifiers
mapping to several mouse Ensembl identifiers were discarded and the human gene
with the highest degree of mouse homology was retained in instances where a mouse
gene mapped to several human genes. Expression levels of mouse genes mapped to
the same human gene were averaged. A two-step z-score procedure was applied such
that the expression levels for each gene were transformed to standard normal
distributions and the expression levels for each cell cluster were transformed to

standard normal distributions. The resulting matrices were used to run DEPICT77
vs1.194 (https://github.com/perslab/depict/) to prioritize cell clusters on the basis of
summary statistics for multi-trait, carbohydrate, protein, fat intake (GWAS association Pvalue cutoff <10-5). DEPICT cell type enrichment P-values were adjusted for the number
of cell types tested for enrichment for each trait, but not for the overall number of traits
tested. Code to construct the average cell type expression and the DEPICT
configuration file can be found at https://github.com/perslab/dietpref_merino.
Joint analysis of functional genomic annotations
We used fGWAS,37 a hierarchical modeling approach that incorporates multiple
types of genetic annotations to re-weight association measures by using information
from the most relevant annotations. The main sources of genomic annotation were
elements of gene structures, outputs from genome segmentation of the six main
ENCODE cell lines, and 13 maps of DNase-I hypersensitivity from primary fetal brain
cell types and cell lines. Details of the generation of these annotations have been
described elsewhere.78
We first tested each of the genomic annotations individually and estimated the
degree of enrichment of each specific annotation with loci that influence dietary intake.
The annotation with the most significant enrichment was retained and tested jointly with
each remaining annotation. If the most significant two annotation model improved the
model likelihood, then the two annotations in the model were retained and the process
continued until the model likelihood cannot be improved. This process resulted in the
“best joint model”. By default, fGWAS partitions the genome into “blocks” of 5,000
genetic variants. We used a modified approach by delineating 1Mb windows comprising

all genetic variants within 500 kb of the index variant and partitioned the intervening
regions into ~1Mb windows. For non-genome-wide significance regions, we used the
default approach. These windows were given as input into fGWAS using the --bed
command and a separate fGWAS analysis was performed using only the set of
annotations remaining in the “best joint model”. The genome-wide enrichments were
used as priors in a Bayesian fine-mapping analysis implemented in fGWAS to calculate
posterior probabilities for each region and each genetic variant in the designated
windows.
Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization (bNMF) algorithm
We applied the bNMF clustering algorithm42–44 with the aim of grouping identified
dietary intake genetic loci into subgroups of variants based on potential similarities
across diverse dietary intake traits. The main input for the bNMF algorithm was the set
of the 96-dietary intake associated variants identified in this study. We restricted the
analysis to the 79 variants that showed at least nominal significant association with fat
intake. Given that C/G and A/T alleles are ambiguous and can lead to errors in aligning
alleles across GWAS, we avoided inclusion of ambiguous alleles, choosing proxies
instead. Next, publicly available summary association statistics for 22 dietary intake
traits from the UK Biobank79 were aggregated for each dietary intake variant
(Supplementary Table 21). For the 79-dietary intake associated variants, the fat intake–
increasing alleles were identified and all future analyses used the aligned fat intake–
increasing alleles. We aligned for fat intake as opposed to other macronutrients since
we had the highest confidence in determining allele association directionality. We
generated standardized effect sizes for variant trait associations from GWAS by dividing

the estimated regression coefficient by the standard error, using the UK Biobank
summary statistic results (variant-trait association matrix (96 by 22)). To enable an
inference for latent overlapping modules or clusters embedded in variant-trait
associations, we modified the existing bNMF algorithm to explicitly account for both
positive and negative associations as was done previously.43,44 The defining features of
each cluster were determined by the most highly associated traits, which is a natural
output of the bNMF approach. bNMF algorithm was performed in R for 1,000 iterations
with different initial conditions, and the maximum posterior solution at the most probable
number of clusters was selected for downstream analysis.
Polygenic risk scores for trait and outcome association with each cluster
The results of the bNMF algorithm provide cluster-specific weights for each variant
and trait. Variants and traits defining each cluster were based on a cut-off of weighting
of 1.09 which was determined by the optimal threshold to define the beginning of the
long-tail of the distribution of cluster’s weights across all clusters (top 5% were
considered to be significant). Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were created by summing
the number of alleles at each genetic variant weighted by the respective effect sizes on
cluster pertinence. To confirm that cluster-specific PRSs mirrored traits defining each
cluster, we tested for associations of PRS with each GWAS dietary trait using inversevariance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis. A conservative significance threshold
was set at 7.6×10−4 (0.05/66; 22 traits and 3 clusters).
Next, individual-level data from the UK Biobank were used to create individual
participant scores by summing the number of alleles at each genetic variant weighted
by the respective effect sizes on cluster pertinence. Scaling of the individual PRS was

performed to allow interpretation of the effects as a per-1 risk allele increase in the PRS
for each trait (division by twice the sum of the effect sizes and multiplication by twice the
square of the SNP count representing the maximum number of risk alleles). We tested
the association of each cluster-specific PRS with BMI (n=453,111), T2D (n=16,890
cases and 436,226 controls), and CAD (n=28,419 cases and 424,694 controls)
adjusting for age, sex, 10 principal components, genotyping array, and BMI (only in
analyses for CAD and T2D). We next used individual-level data from the Partners
Healthcare Biobank (n =19,596)45 to investigate the extent to which UK Biobank
associations replicated in an independent dataset. A detailed description of the Partners
Healthcare Biobank is provided below. Disease prevalence for obesity (n=5,039 cases
and 14,557 controls), T2D (n=1,497 cases and 18,099 controls), and CAD (n=2,673
cases and 16,293 controls) were determined from electronic medical records using both
structured and unstructured data. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age,
sex, 5 principal components, and obesity (only in analyses for CAD and T2D). PRS
associations with cardiometabolic phenotypes were considered significant at Bonferroni
corrected threshold of significance at P<5.6×10-3 (0.05/9; 3 cluster and 3 traits).

including two stages of genetic variant removal and an intermediate stage of sample
exclusion. The exclusion criteria for variants were: 1) missing call rate ≥0.05, 2) MAF
<0.001, and 3) deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 10-6). The exclusion
criteria for samples were: 1) sex discordances between the reported and genetically

estimated identity-by-descent ≥0.125, from which we removed the individual with the
highest proportion of missingness), and 4) population structure showing more than four

Fig 2 | Implicated tissue, pathways, and cell expression profiles for dietary intake in the multi-trait genome-wide
association meta-analysis of 283,119 individuals. a) MAGMA tissue expression enrichment analysis using gene
expression per tissue based on GTEx RNA-seq data for 53 specific tissue types for multiple-trait macronutrient intake.

Expression values (Reads Per Kilobase Million – RPKM) were log2 transformed with winsorization at 50 and averaged per
tissue (Methods). The dashed line indicates the threshold for significance (P<0.05/53). b) Gene set enrichment analysis in
10,651 curated gene sets representing known biological functions and metabolic pathways derived from MSigDB. Only
shown the top 10 findings. The dashed line indicates the threshold for significance (P<0.05/10,651 gene sets). c) Singlecell expression analysis of genes related to dietary intake in 24 cell types from mouse brain (Methods). The x axis shows
the –log10 transformed two-tailed P value of association of multi-trait genome-wide association meta-analysis statistics
with cell-specific gene-expression levels in a linear model. The dashed grey line indicates the Bonferroni-corrected
significance threshold (P<0.05/24 level 1 + 149 level 2 annotations). d) Single-cell expression analysis of genes related to
dietary intake using Drop-seq data from 20,921 individual cells in and around the adult mouse Arc-ME (Methods). The x
axis shows the –log10 transformed two-tailed P value of association of multi-trait genome-wide association meta-analysis
statistics with cell-specific gene-expression levels in a linear model. The dashed grey line denotes FDR=0.05 derived by
DEPICT.

Fig 3 | Joint analysis of functional genomic annotations and multi-trait genome-wide association meta-analysis.
Reweighted multi-trait genome-wide association meta-analysis for dietary intake using fGWAS. Single significant
annotations were combined using a hierarchical modeling approach based on penalized likelihood (Methods). The model
identified DNase I hypersensitivity sites in fetal brain, weak enhancers in HeLa cells, and repressed chromatin in B cell as
the most relevant annotations (Supplementary Table 14). Each point represents a region of the genome, and shown are
the posterior probabilities of association (PPAs) of the regions in the models with and without the annotations.

Fig 4 | Association of cluster-specific polygenic risk scores and cardiometabolic phenotypes. Cluster-specific
polygenic risk scores were defined by the top set of strongest-weighted variants for each cluster using a cutoff weighting
of 1.09 (Methods). Individual participant scores were created by summing the number of alleles at each genetic variant
weighted by the respective effect sizes on cluster pertinence. a). Individual-level data from the UK Biobank was used to
test the association of cluster specific polygenic risk scores with BMI n=453,111), T2D (n=16,890 cases and 436,226
controls), and CAD (n=28,419 cases and 424,694 controls) after adjusting for age, sex, principal components, genotyping
array, and BMI (only in analyses for CAD and T2D) (Methods). b) Individual-level data from the Partners Healthcare
Biobank was used to investigate the extent to which previous observed associations replicated in an independent dataset.
Sample size in Partners Healthcare Biobank was obesity (n=5,039 cases and 14,557 controls), T2D (n=1,497 cases and
18,099 controls), and CAD (n=2,673 cases and 16,293 controls) (Methods). Estimated effect sizes provided by one allele
increase in the PRS. PRS associations were considered significant at Bonferroni corrected threshold of significance
(0.05/12 (3 cluster and 3 outcomes) P<5.56×10-3). * P<0.05, ** P<0.01, ***P<<5.56×10-3

Note: The lead variants in approximately 5% of loci were non-synonymous. Shown here are all non-synonymous variants,
and selected non-synonymous variants in high LD with a lead variant for a given genomic loci (The complete list of 67
non-synonymous variants (38 reaching genome-wide significance) is detailed in Supplementary Table 6). a These variants
were not themselves lead variants, but were in high LD with a sentinel variant (r2>0.8 from the 1000 Genomes European
population). Pmulti-trait value derived from the multi-trait genome-wide association meta-analysis. Effect sizes (β and SE)
derived from single-trait GWAS meta-analysis for each respective macronutrient. CHO, carbohydrate; PROT, protein. *
P<5×10-05, ** P<5.00×10-8 in the single-trait genome-wide association meta-analysis. CHR, chromosome; BP, Base Pair
based on Hg 19; EA, Effect Allele; NEA, Non-Effect Allele; EAF, Effect Allele Frequency.
