The (p)ppGpp-mediated stringent response is a bacterial stress response implicated in virulence and
antibiotic tolerance. Both synthesis and degradation of the (p)ppGpp alarmone nucleotide are
mediated by RelA-SpoT Homolog (RSH) enzymes which can be broadly divided in two classes:
single-domain ‘short’ RSHs and multi-domain ‘long’ RSHs enzymes. The regulatory ACT
(Aspartokinase, Chorismate mutase and TyrA) / RRM (RNA Recognition Motif) domain is a nearuniversal C-terminal domain of long RSHs. Deletion of RRM in both monofunctional (synthesisonly) RelA as well as bifunctional (i.e. capable of both degrading and synthesising the alarmone) Rel
renders the long RSH cytotoxic due to overproduction of (p)ppGpp. To probe the molecular
mechanism underlying this effect we characterised Escherichia coli RelA and Bacillus subtilis Rel
RSHs lacking RRM. We demonstrate that, first, the cytotoxicity caused by the removal of RRM is
counteracted by secondary mutations that disrupt the interaction of the RSH with the starved
ribosomal complex – the ultimate inducer of (p)ppGpp production by RelA and Rel – and, second,
that the hydrolytic activity of Rel is not abrogated in the truncated mutant. Therefore, we conclude
that the overproduction of (p)ppGpp by RSHs lacking the RRM domain is not explained by lack of
auto-inhibition in the absence of RRM or/and a defect in (p)ppGpp hydrolysis. Instead, we argue that
it is driven by misregulation of the RSH activation by the ribosome.

Bacteria employ diverse mechanisms to sense and respond to stress. One such mechanism is the
stringent response – a near-universal stress response orchestrated by hyper-phosphorylated
derivatives of housekeeping nucleotides GDP and GTP: guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and
guanosine pentaphosphate (pppGpp), collectively referred to as (p)ppGpp (Hauryliuk et al., 2015;Liu
et al., 2015;Steinchen and Bange, 2016). Since the stringent response and (p)ppGpp-mediated
signalling are implicated in virulence, antibiotic resistance and tolerance (Dalebroux et al.,
2010;Dalebroux and Swanson, 2012;Hauryliuk et al., 2015), this stress signalling system has been
recently targeted for development of new anti-infective compounds (Kushwaha et al., 2019).

Both synthesis and degradation of (p)ppGpp is mediated by RelA/SpoT Homolog (RSH) enzymes.
RSHs can be broadly divided into two classes: ‘long’ multi-domain and ‘short’ single-domain factors
(Atkinson et al., 2011;Jimmy et al., 2019). In the majority of bacteria, including model Gram-positive
bacterial species Bacillus subtilis, the long multi-domain RSHs are represented by one bifunctional
enzyme, Rel (Mittenhuber, 2001;Atkinson et al., 2011). Beta- and gammaproteobacteria, such as
Escherichia coli, encode two long RSH factors – RelA and SpoT – which are the products of gene
duplication and diversification of the ancestral rel stringent factor (Mittenhuber, 2001;Atkinson et al.,
2011;Hauryliuk et al., 2015). E. coli RelA is the most well-studied long RSH. RelA is a dedicated
sensor of amino acid starvation with strong (p)ppGpp synthesis activity that is induced by ribosomal
complexes harbouring cognate deacylated tRNA in the A-site, so-called ‘starved’ ribosomal
complexes (Haseltine and Block, 1973). Unlike RelA, which lacks (p)ppGpp hydrolysis activity
(Shyp et al., 2012), Rel and SpoT can both synthesise and degrade (p)ppGpp (Xiao et al.,
1991;Avarbock et al., 2000). Similarly to RelA, (p)ppGpp synthesis by Rel is strongly activated by
starved ribosomes (Avarbock et al., 2000). In addition to long RSHs, bacteria often encode single
domain RSH enzymes: Small Alarmone Synthetases (SAS) and Small Alarmone Hydrolases (SAS)
(Atkinson et al., 2011;Jimmy et al., 2019), such as RelQ and RelP in the Firmicute bacterium B.
subtilis (Nanamiya et al., 2008).

Long RSHs are universally comprised of two functional regions: the catalytic N-terminal domains
(NTD) and the regulatory C-terminal domains (CTD) (Figure 1A) (Atkinson et al., 2011). The NTD
region comprises the (p)ppGpp hydrolase domain (HD; enzymatically inactive in RelA) and the
(p)ppGpp synthetase domain (SYNTH) linked by an α-helical region that regulates the allosteric
crosstalk between both domains (Tamman et al., 2019). The CTD encompasses four domains: the
Thr-tRNA synthetase, GTPase and SpoT domain (TGS), the Helical domain, the Zing Finger Domain
(ZFD) (equivalent to Ribosome-InterSubunit domain, RIS, as per (Loveland et al., 2016), or
Conserved Cysteine, CC, as per (Atkinson et al., 2011)), and, finally, the RNA Recognition Motif
domain (RRM) (equivalent to Aspartokinase, Chorismate mutase and TyrA, ACT, as per (Atkinson
et al., 2011)). When RelA/Rel is bound to a starved ribosomal complex, the TGS domain inspects the
deacylated tRNA in the A-site and the TGS domain interacts directly with the 3' CCA end of the Asite tRNA (Arenz et al., 2016;Brown et al., 2016;Loveland et al., 2016). The conserved histidine 432
residue of E. coli RelA mediating this interaction is crucial for activation of RelA’s enzymatic
activity by the 3' CCA (Winther et al., 2018). Both ZFD and RRM interact with the A-site finger
(ASF) of the 23S ribosomal RNA (Arenz et al., 2016;Brown et al., 2016;Loveland et al., 2016), and
in E. coli RelA this contact is crucial for efficient recruitment to and activation by starved ribosomal
complexes (Kudrin et al., 2018).

While the NTD is responsible for the enzymatic function of RSHs, the CTD senses the starved
ribosomal complex and transmits the signal to activate NTD-mediated (p)ppGpp synthesis by Rel /

RelA (Agirrezabala et al., 2013;Arenz et al., 2016;Brown et al., 2016;Loveland et al., 2016). Since
removal of the CTD increases the rate of (p)ppGpp production by Rel/RelA in the absence of
ribosomes or starved complexes, the CTD was proposed to mediate the auto-inhibition of the NTD
synthetase activity, thus precluding uncontrolled production of cytotoxic (p)ppGpp (Schreiber et al.,
1991;Gropp et al., 2001;Mechold et al., 2002;Avarbock et al., 2005;Jiang et al., 2007;Yang et al.,
2019).

The specific focus of this study is the C-terminal RRM / ACT domain of ribosome-associated RSH
RelA and Rel. The RRM is absent in RelA enzymes from Methylotenera mobilitas, Elusimicrobium
minutum, Francisella philomiraga and Francisella tularensis (Atkinson et al., 2011). The only
experimentally characterised representative amongst these is F. tularensis RelA (Wilkinson et al.,
2015). In a reconstituted biochemical system, the factor behaves similarly to E. coli RelA, i.e. it has
very low synthesis activity by itself – which suggests that the factor is capable of efficient autoinhibition mechanism – and is potently activated by the ribosome. Conversely, deletion of the RRM
domain in factors that naturally possess it leads to over-production of (p)ppGpp in the cell, as shown
for Caulobacter crescentus (Ronneau et al., 2018) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gratani et al., 2018)
Rel, as well as E. coli RelA (Turnbull et al., 2019). The exact molecular mechanism of misregulation
remains unclear, and as a possible explanation it was suggested that the DRRM factors overproduce
(p)ppGpp due to a lack of auto-inhibition or/and – in the case of C. crescentus Rel (Ronneau et al.,
2018) – reduced hydrolysis activity.

In this report, we inspected the possible role of the ribosome in hyper-activation of ΔRRM variants of
long RSHs in the cell. By characterising DRRM versions of E. coli RelA and B. subtilis Rel, we
demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of the mutant protein is strictly dependent on the interaction with
the ribosome and deacylated tRNA and, therefore, cannot be explained by a lack of autoinhibition
alone.

The entire coding region of the B. subtilis rel gene was amplified by PCR using the synthetic
oligonucleotide pQErelA_F and pQErelA_R containing a BamHI site and B. subtilis genomic DNA
as a template. The resulting PCR fragment was cut with BamHI and then inserted into the BamHI
sites of pQE60 (Qiagen), yielding plasmid pQErelA. pOErelA was transformed into E. coli M15
(pREP4) (Qiagen), fresh transformants were inoculated into LB liquid culture (1000 mL) with 100
µg/mL ampicillin and grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. At OD600 of 0.8 expression of Rel
induced with 1 mM IPTG (final concentration). After 3 hours of expression the cells were harvested
by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) supplemented
with 2 mM PMSF and lysed by sonication. Rel-His6 inclusion bodies were collected by
centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A supplemented with 8 M guanidine hydrochloride (= buffer B)
and loaded onto an Ni-NTA agarose column (QIAGEN) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The
column was washed with buffer B supplemented with 10 mM imidazole, and the protein was eluted
with a 100-400 mM imidazole gradient in buffer B. The fractions containing Rel-His6 was dialyzed
against buffer A at 4 °C overnight. Aggregated Rel-His6 protein was collected by centrifugation,
resuspended in buffer A supplemented with 6 M urea and used for rabbit immunization. Rabbit
serum was used as a polyclonal anti-Rel antibody.

B. subtilis strains were pre-grown on LB plates overnight at 30 °C. Fresh individual colonies were
used to inoculate 200 mL LB cultures that were grown at 37 °C. At OD600 of 0.2 amino acid
starvation was induced by addition of isoleucyl tRNA synthetase inhibitor mupirocin (dissolved in
DMSO, AppliChem) to final concentration of 700 nM for 20 minutes. As a mock control, a separate
culture was treated with the same amount of DMSO. After 20 minutes the cells were collected by
centrifugation (8,000 rpm, 5 minutes, JLA-16.25 Beckman Coulter rotor), dissolved in 0.5 mL of
HEPES:Polymix buffer (5 mM Mg(OAc)2) supplemented with 2 mM PMSF, lysed using FastPrep
homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) by four 20 seconds pulses at speed 6.0 mp/sec with chilling on ice
for 1 minutes between the cycles), and clarified by ultracentrifugation (14,800 rpm for 20 minutes,

For Western blotting 0.5 mL fractions were supplemented with 1.5 mL of 99.5% ethanol, precipitated
overnight at –20 °C. After centrifugation at 14,800 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 °C the supernatants were
discarded and the samples were dried. The pellets were resuspended in 40 µL of 2xSDS loading
buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% SDS (w/v) 0.02% Bromophenol blue, 20% glycerol (w/v) 4%
b-mercaptoethanol), resolved on the 12% SDS PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane
(Trans-Blot Turbo Midi Nitrocellulose Transfer Pack, Bio-Rad , 0.2 µm pore size) with the use of a
Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer Starter System (Bio-Rad) (10 minutes, 2.5A, 25V). Membrane blocking
was done for one hour in PBS-T (1xPBS 0.05% Tween-20) with 5% w/v nonfat dry milk at room
temperature. Rel was detected using either anti-Rel primary combined with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP
secondary antibodies or anti-L3 primary antibodies (a gift from Fujio Kawamura (Murina et al.,
2018b)) combined with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibodies, respectively. All antibodies
were used at 1:10,000 dilution. ECL detection was performed using WesternBrightTM Quantum (K12042-D10, Advansta) Western blotting substrate and an ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare)

Wild type and mutant variants of B. subtilis Rel were overexpressed in freshly transformed E. coli
BL21 DE3 Rosetta (Novagen). Fresh transformants were inoculated to final OD600 of 0.05 in the LB
medium (800 mL) supplemented with 100 µg/mL kanamycin. The cultures were grown at 37 °C until
an OD600 of 0.5, induced with 1 mM IPTG (final concentration) and grown for additional 1.5 hour at
30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (750 mM KCl, 5 mM

To prevent possible substitution of Zn2+ ions in Rel’s Zn-finger domain for Ni2+ during purification
on an Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography column (Block et al., 2009), a 5 mL HisTrap HP
column was stripped from Ni2+ in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations, washed with 5
column volumes (CV) of 100 mM Zn(OAc)2 pH 5.0 followed by 5 CV of deionized water. Clarified
cell lysate was filtered through a 0.2 µm syringe filter and loaded onto the Zn2+-charged HisTrap 5
mL HP column pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 5 CV of buffer A, and the
protein was eluted with a linear gradient (6 CV, 0-100% buffer B) of buffer B (750 mM KCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, 40 µM MnCl2, 40 µM Zn(OAc)2, 1 mM mellitic acid, 500 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 4
mM β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mM HEPES:KOH pH 8). Mellitic acid forms highly ordered molecular
networks when dissolved in water (Inabe, 2005) and it was shown to promote the stability of
Thermus thermophilus Rel (Van Nerom et al., 2019). Fractions most enriched in Rel (≈25-50% buffer
B) were pooled, totalling approximately 5 mL. The sample was loaded on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex
200 pg column pre-equilibrated with a high salt buffer (buffer C; 2 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10%
glycerol, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mM HEPES:KOH pH 8). The fractions containing Rel were
pooled and applied on HiPrep 10/26 desalting column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with storage
buffer (buffer D; 720 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM arginine, 50 mM glutamic acid, 10% glycerol,
4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mM HEPES:KOH pH 8). Arginine and glutamic acid were added to
improve protein solubility and long-term stability (Golovanov et al., 2004). The fractions containing
Rel were collected and concentrated in an Amicon Ultra (Millipore) centrifugal filter device (cut-off
50 kDa). To cleave off the His10-SUMO tag, 35 µg of His6-Ulp1 per 1 mg of Rel were added and the
reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After the His10-SUMO tag was
cleaved off, the protein was passed though 5 mL Zn2+-charged HisTrap HP pre-equilibrated with
buffer D. Fractions containing Rel in the flow-through were collected and concentrated on Amicon
Ultra (Millipore) centrifugal filter device with 50 kDa cut-off. The purity of protein preparations was
assessed by SDS-PAGE and spectrophotometrically (OD260/OD280 ratio below 0.8 corresponding to
less than 5% RNA contamination (Layne, 1957)). Protein preparations were aliquoted, frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Individual single-use aliquots were discarded after the
experiment. Chromatography profiles and the corresponding SDS-PAGE gels for wild type Rel
purification as well as gel filtration profiles for ΔRRM mutant Rel variant are presented on (Figure

charcoal was added and the slurry was stirred under the hood for 30 minutes. The slurry was filtered
through, first, Whatman paper and then through a 0.45 µm BA85 membrane. The final solution was
stored at 4 °C in a bottle wrapped in foil since putrescine is photosensitive. The preparation of 2 L of
10X Polymix buffer base used 141.66 g KCl, 5.35 g NH4Cl, 21.44 g Mg(OAc)2•4H2O, 1.47 g
CaCl2•2H2O, 5.092 g spermidine, and 160 ml of putrescine solution (described above). The salts
were dissolved in ddH2O (»1,500 mL), then the putrescine solution was added and mixed well.
Spermidine was dissolved in a small volume of ddH2O and added to the mixture. The pH was
adjusted to 7.5 with concentrated acetic acid or 5 M KOH, and after that the volume was adjusted by
adding ddH2O to 2 L. The buffer was filtered through 0.2 µm nitrocellulose filter (2-3 filters are
needed). The resulting 10X Polymix buffer base was aliquoted and stored at –20 °C. The final
working HEPES:Polymix buffer was made using the 10X Polymix buffer base, 1M DDT and 1 M
HEPES:KOH pH 7.5 and contains 20 mM HEPES:KOH pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM MgOAc2, 95

B. subtilis strain RIK2508 (trpC2 ∆hpf) strain (Akanuma et al., 2016;Brodiazhenko et al., 2018) was
pre-grown on LB plates overnight at 30 °C. Fresh individual colonies were used to inoculate LB
liquid cultures (25 × 400 mL) to OD600 of 0.05 and grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. At OD600
1.2 the cells were pelleted at 4 °C (TLA10.500 (Beckman), 15 min at 5,000-8,000 rcf), resuspended
with ice-cold PBS buffer, pelleted again in 50 mL Falcon tubes, frozen with liquid nitrogen and
stored at –80 °C. Approximately 20 g of frozen B. subtilis cells were resuspended in 50 mL of cell
opening buffer (100 mM NH4Cl, 15 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 3 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20
mM Tris:HCl pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mU Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.1 mM
PMSF and 35 µg/mL lysozyme, incubated on ice for one hour, and opened by three passages on a
high-pressure cell disrupter (Stansted Fluid Power) at 220 MPa. Lysed cells were clarified by
centrifugation for 40 min at 40,000 rpm (Ti 45 rotor, Beckman), NH4Cl concentration was adjusted
to 400 mM, and the mixture was filtered through 0.45 µm syringe filters. The filtrated lysate was
loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 80 mL CIMmultus QA-80 column (BIA Separations, quaternary
amine advanced composite column) at a flow rate of 20 mL/min, and the column washed with 5 CV
(CV = 80 mL) of low salt buffer (400 mM NH4Cl, 15 mM Mg(OAc)2, 3 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20
mM Tris:HCl pH 7.5). Ribosomes were then eluted in 45 mL fractions by a step gradient to 77% high
salt buffer (900 mM NH4Cl, 15 mM Mg(OAc)2, 3 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM Tris:HCl pH 7.5)
for 5 CV, followed by 100% high salt buffer for 1 CV. The fractions containing ribosomes were
pooled, the concentration of NH4Cl was adjusted to 100 mM, and the ribosomes were treated with
puromycin added to a final concentration of 10 µM. The resultant crude 70S preparation was
resolved on a 10-40% sucrose gradient in overlay buffer (60 mM NH4Cl, 15 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.25
mM EDTA, 3 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM Tris:HCl pH 7.5) in a zonal rotor (Ti 15, Beckman, 17
hours at 21,000 rpm). The peak containing pure 70S ribosomes was pelleted by centrifugation (20
hours at 35,000 rpm), and the final ribosomal preparation was dissolved in HEPES:Polymix buffer
(20 mM HEPES:KOH pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 95 mM KCl, 5 mM NH4Cl, 0.5 mM
CaCl2, 8 mM putrescine, 1 mM spermidine (Antoun et al., 2004)). 70S concentration was measured
spectrophotometrically (1 OD260 corresponds to 23 nM of 70S) and ribosomes were aliquoted (50100 µL per aliquot), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C.

Toxicity of E. coli ΔRRM RelA is countered by mutations compromising the interaction

307

To test whether the toxicity of RelAΔRRM in E. coli is dependent on the interaction with starved
complexes, we used our system for low-level ectopic expression of RelA from a low copy number
mini R1 plasmid (pNDM220, present in one to two copies per chromosome (Molin et al., 1979))
under the control of PA1/O4/O3 promoter (Turnbull et al., 2019). Guided by the recent cryo-EM
reconstructions of RelA (Arenz et al., 2016;Brown et al., 2016;Loveland et al., 2016), we designed a
set of mutations that will specifically disrupt RelA’s interaction with starved ribosomal complexes.

To disrupt the interaction between RelA and the tRNA, we adopted the H432E mutation in the TGS
domain that was earlier shown to specifically abrogate the recognition of the 3' CCA end of the A/R
tRNA (Winther et al., 2018). This conserved histidine residue stacks between the two cytosine bases
and hydrogen-bonds the phosphodiester backbone (Figure 1B). Replacing it with glutamic acid
introduces a charge repulsion effect as well as a steric clash. To disrupt the interaction with the
ribosome we used mutations in the ZFD: R629E as well as a double substitution C602A/C603A; both
mutants are expected to compromise the recognition of the 23S rRNA ASF element that is crucial for
RelA recruitment (Kudrin et al., 2018). The conserved double motif docks the ZFD α-helix into the
major groove of the ASF; replacement by alanine is expected to abrogate this interaction (Figure
1C). The conserved arginine 629 residue is in close proximity to A886-A887 and A885-A886
phosphodiester bonds (3.5Å and 5Å, respectively), and, therefore, the R629E substitution is expected
to cause electrostatic repulsion.

In good agreement with our previous results (Turnbull et al., 2019), low-level expression of fulllength RelA has a minor, but detectable growth inhibitory effect both when tested on solid Agar
media (Figure 3A) and in liquid LB cultures (growth rate decreases from 60 (vector) to 89 min)
(Figure 3B). Deletion of the RRM renders RelA significantly more toxic (growth rate decreases to
148 min). The effect is countered by TGS H432E, ZFD R629E and even more so by the
C612A/C613A mutations (Figure 3AB). We directly confirm the lack of activation by deacylated
tRNA in the case of H432E E. coli RelA using biochemical assays (Supplementary Figure 1).

327
328
329

Taken together, our results suggest that RelAΔRRM toxicity in E. coli could be dependent on the
interaction with starved ribosomes and is not due to a defect in auto-inhibition alone. To test the
generality of this hypothesis, we next characterised B. subtilis Rel lacking the RRM domain.

We expressed ΔRRM Rel under the control of an IPTG-inducible Phy-spank promotor (Britton et al.,
2002) in ppGpp0 (DrelDrelPDrelQ) (Nanamiya et al., 2008) or Drel B. subtilis strains (Figure 4A). In
the ppGpp0 background, inhibition of B. subtilis growth on LB plates is a marker of toxic (p)ppGpp
overproduction. In the Drel background (p)ppGpp is overproduced by a SAS in the absence of Rel’s
hydrolytic activity, causing a growth defect in B. subtilis (Nanamiya et al., 2008) and S. aureus
(Geiger et al., 2014). Therefore, this experiment tests the complementation of hydrolase function of
Rel that manifests in improved growth.

Unlike the full-length Rel, the RelDRRM truncation is toxic in the ppGpp0 and Drel backgrounds, both
when the growth is followed on plates (Figure 4A) and in liquid culture (Figure 4BC). To probe the
role of the interactions with starved ribosomes in RelDRRM toxicity, we used a set of substitutions in
B. subtilis RelA corresponding to those used to study E. coli RelA (Figures 1 and 3). The toxicity of

the RelDRRM mutant is efficiently countered by the H420E substitution in the TGS as well as the
R619E and C602A/C603A substitutions in the ZFD (Figure 4D). This strongly suggests that the
intact interaction with tRNA and starved ribosomes is essential for the toxicity of RelDRRM. For
comparison, we tested, full-length Rel, RelDRRMDZDF C-terminal truncation, as well as the NTD
domain region alone. The RelDRRMDZDF mutant is only slightly toxic in the ppGpp0 background and its
expression promotes growth in the Drel background (Figure 4A). NTD-alone construct displays no
toxicity in the ppGpp0 background and does not promote the growth in the Drel background,
suggesting weak – or absent – synthetase activity.

To separate the effects of (p)ppGpp production from the effects of (p)ppGpp degradation, we tested
synthesis-deficient SYNTH D264G mutants (Nanamiya et al., 2008) of C-terminally truncated Rel
variants (Figure 4A). The toxicity of the DRRM variant is abolished by the D264G mutation
demonstrating that it is, indeed, mediated by (p)ppGpp production and not, for example, through
inhibition of protein synthesis via competitive binding to ribosomal A-site (the latter non-enzymatic
mechanism of toxicity was shown for E. coli RelACTD (Turnbull et al., 2019)). Both DRRM D264G
and ΔZFDΔRRM D264G variants promote growth in the Drel strain suggesting that neither deletion
of DRRM alone – or both ΔZFD and ΔRRM – abrogates the hydrolysis activity of B. subtilis Rel
(Figure 4A, bottom panel). At the same time expression of the synthesis-inactive D264G RelNTD has
no effect, suggesting that the NTD does not efficiently hydrolyse (p)ppGpp. To test if further
truncations of the NTD-only Rel (Rel1-373) would induce hydrolytic activity, we tested several
additional constructs of B. subtilis Rel – Rel1-336, Rel1-196 and Rel155 – but neither of them could
rescue the growth effect of ∆rel B. subtilis (Supplementary Figure S2).

364
365

Taken together, our results demonstrate that i) RelΔRRM is toxic in B. subtilis, ii) the toxicity is
mediated by (p)ppGpp synthesis and iii) it is abrogated by mutations disrupting the interaction with
tRNA and starved ribosomes. This suggests that the misactivation of the RelΔRRM mutant by the
ribosome is the underlying cause of the toxicity.

To test the low-level, non-toxic, synthesis activity of Rel mutants and to validate the effects of point
mutations disrupting the interaction of Rel with starved ribosomal complexes, we took advantage of
the amino acid auxotrophy phenotype of the ppGpp0 B. subtilis (DrelDrelPDrelQ) (Nanamiya et al.,
2008)).

When ppGpp0 B. subtilis is grown on Spizizen minimum medium (Spizizen, 1958) in the absence of
casamino acids, neither of the D264G Rel mutants – either full-length or C-terminal truncations –
promote growth, both whether or not expression is induced by 1 mM IPTG (Figure 4E, right panels).
Full induction of NTD expression with 1 mM IPTG near-completely supressed the auxotrophy
phenotype (Figure 4E, top right panel), while the leaky expression in the absence of IPTG results in
weak, but detectable suppression (Figure 4E, bottom right panel). This demonstrates that B. subtilis
NTD has a weak net-synthesis activity. The RelDRRM is, as expected, highly toxic when expression is
induced by IPTG; conversely, low-level leakage expression efficiently supresses the amino acid
auxotrophy phenotype. Removal of both RRM and ZFD domains renders the protein non-toxic. It is
not trivial to reconcile this effect with the idea that removal of the RRM renders the protein toxic due
to lack of auto-inhibition: one would expect that the additional removal of the ZFD domain would
further compromise the CTD-mediated negative control in RelΔRRM.

We next used the auxotrophy assay to test the effects of the H420E TGS and C602A/C603A ZFD
substitutions on the activity of Rel expressed from the native genomic locus under the control of the
native promotor (Figure 4F). As a positive control we used a strain lacking the genomic copy of relC
encoding ribosomal protein L11. This ribosomal element is essential for E. coli RelA activation by
starved ribosomal complexes (Parker et al., 1976;Wendrich et al., 2002;Shyp et al., 2012) as well as
for cellular functionality of C. crescentus Rel (Boutte and Crosson, 2011). The ppGpp0 strain
expressing H420E Rel fails to growth on the minimum media, reinforcing the crucial role of that this
residue, while the C602A/C603A can sustain the growth, suggesting that this substitution does not
completely abrogate the activity.

Next, we probed the ribosomal association of DRRM and full-length Rel expressed in the ppGpp0
background using a centrifugation sucrose gradient followed by Western blotting using antiserum
against native, untagged B. subtilis Rel (Figure 5A). Since deacylated tRNA promotes ribosomal
recruitment of E. coli RelA (Agirrezabala et al., 2013;Kudrin et al., 2017), we probed the association
of wild type and mutant Rel variants with the ribosome both under exponential growth and upon
acute isoleucine starvation induced by the isoleucyl tRNA synthetase inhibitor antibiotic mupirocin
(pseudomonic acid) (Thomas et al., 2010). In good agreement with the cryo-EM structures detailing
multiple contacts between the RRM and the starved complex and therefore suggesting an importance
of this element in ribosomal recruitment (Arenz et al., 2016;Brown et al., 2016;Loveland et al.,
2016), we do not detect a stable association of DRRM Rel with the ribosome upon a mupirocin
challenge. This suggests that the interaction with the ribosome is significantly destabilised in RelDRRM
and the protein dissociates during centrifugation. It is noteworthy that, despite an unstable association
of RelΔRRM with starved ribosomes, the expression of this protein strongly induces the accumulation
of 100S ribosomal dimers, which is indicative of (p)ppGpp overproduction (Tagami et al., 2012).

Our microbiological experiments demonstrate that both the C602A and C603A double substitution
and the R619E point substitution render RelDRRM non-toxic, which we attribute to further
destabilisation of Rel’s interaction with starved ribosomal complexes (Figure 4D). To directly probe
the effects of these mutations, we used centrifugation experiments with full-length Rel carrying the
substitutions. As expected, both the C603A double mutant and R619E full-length variants are
compromised in recruitment to the ribosome upon a mupirocin challenge (Figure 5A).

Taken together, these results demonstrate that RelΔRRM is significantly more toxic (i.e. more active in
(p)ppGpp production in the cell) than the full-length protein and this toxicity is dependent on the
interaction with starved ribosomes, which is, in turn, destabilised in this truncation. As a next step,
we set out to test the effects of RRM deletion – either alone or in combination with mutations further
compromising the interactions with starved ribosomes – on Rel’s enzymatic activity in a
reconstituted B. subtilis biochemical system.

To purify untagged B. subtilis Rel we combined our protocols used for purification of E. coli RelA
(Turnbull et al., 2019) and T. thermophilus Rel (Van Nerom et al., 2019). (Figure 2). Importantly,
during all of the chromatography steps we followed both absorbance at 260 and 280 nm
complemented with SDS PAGE analysis of fractions. This is essential in order to identify and
specifically pool the fractions containing Rel free from RNA contamination. After the initial capture

using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) in high ionic strength conditions (750 mM
KCl) using HisTrap HP column charged with Zn2+ in order to avoid possible replacement of the Zn2+
in the ZFD domain by Ni2+ ions (Block et al., 2009), His10-SUMO-Rel was applied on size-exclusion
chromatography (SEC) on HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (Figure 2D). Both in the case of
the full length (Figure 2B) and DRRM Rel (Figure 2C), the RNA-free fractions constitute the
minority of the protein that elute considerably later than the bulk of the RNA-contaminated Rel
which elutes considerably. While the SEC step is essential for generating RNA-free Rel preparations,
the majority of the protein prep is lost at this stage. After the SEC step, the buffer was exchanged to
storage buffer containing arginine and glutamic acid that improve protein solubility and long-term
stability (Golovanov et al., 2004) (Figure 2D), His10-SUMO tag was cleaved off and removed by
passing the protein via second IMAC (Figure 2E). The quality of the final preparations was assessed
by SDS-PAGE (Figure 2F) as well as spectrophotometrically: OD260/OD280 ratio below 0.8
corresponding to less than 5% RNA contamination (Layne, 1957).

It was recently proposed that the RRM domain has a stimulatory effect on the hydrolysis activity of
C. crescentus Rel, and the loss of this regulatory mechanism explains the toxicity of the DRRM
mutant (Ronneau et al., 2018). This hypothesis does not explain the toxicity of the DRRM variant of
the synthesis-only RSH RelA (Turnbull et al., 2019) and our microbiological experiments showing
that the synthesis-defective DRRM D264G variant of B. subtilis Rel remains active as a (p)ppGpp
hydrolase (Figure 4A). Enzymatic assays following 3H-pppGpp degradation by full-length and
RelDRRM show that the latter is approximately twice less active (Figure 5B). While the defect is
detectable, it is in good agreement with our microbiological experiments, relatively mild.
Importantly, the enzyme characterised by Ronneau and colleagues (C. crescentus Rel∆668-719) was not
completely lacking the RRM, and it is possible that the remaining beta-strand alpha-helix turn
structural element was interfering with the hydrolysis activity of the construct (Ronneau et al., 2018).

We tested the 3H-pppGpp synthesis by full-length Rel as well as RelDRRM, either alone or activated by
the ribosomes or starved complexes in a reconstituted system (Figure 5C). When the protein is tested
by itself, the RelDRRM mutant is less active than the full-length, suggesting that deletion of the RRM
domain does not lead to the loss of auto-inhibition. While RelDRRM remains less active than the fulllength when activated by initiation complexes (about two-fold), in the presence of starved ribosomal
complexes the two proteins are equally active. This could be explained by tRNA stabilising Rel on
the ribosome and overriding the defect caused by the removal of the RRM domain.

The R619E mutation compromises activation of the full-length Rel by the initiation complexes (more
than four-fold), and the effect is less pronounced in the presence of deacylated tRNAVal (less than
two-fold decrease in activity). Just as in the case of the RRM deletion, a possible explanation is that
the deacylated tRNA strongly stimulates the binding of Rel to the ribosome and offsets the effect of
the mutation R619E. When the R619E substitution is introduced into DRRM Rel, the combination of
the two mutations destabilising Rel binding to the ribosome results in compromised activation both
by the initiation (five-fold) and starved (seven-fold) ribosomal complex. Despite several attempts we
failed to generate sufficiently pure and soluble C602/C603 RelDRRM, which precluded direct
biochemical characterisation of this mutant.

Taken together, our biochemical results demonstrate that while RRM is important in Rel recruitment
to the ribosome, this domain is not absolutely essential for the activation of its (p)ppGpp synthesis
activity by starved ribosomal complexes, which is consistent with the ribosome-dependent nature of
the RelDRRM toxicity in live cells.

Taken together, our results demonstrate that i) deletion of the RRM domain renders B. subtilis Rel
and E. coli RelA toxic due to (p)ppGpp overproduction in a ribosome and tRNA-dependent manner,
ii) RRM deletion does not abrogate the (p)ppGpp hydrolysis activity of B. subtilis Rel iii) RRM
deletion destabilises the interaction of B. subtilis Rel with starved ribosomal complexes, and iv) this
destabilisation renders the mutant enzyme more sensitive than the full length Rel to deactivation by
additional substitutions further compromising its association with starved ribosomes. Our
biochemical results do not explain why exactly DRRM Rel/RelA is toxic: if anything, the protein
behaves as a poorer binder (Figure 3D) and is less active (Figure 3E) as compared to the full-length
Rel. A dedicated follow-up study is necessary to clarify this question.

Our report expands the mutation toolbox for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of long RSH
enzymes. We confirm that, as was shown for H432E E. coli RelA mutant (Winther et al., 2018), the
corresponding H420E mutation in B. subtilis Rel is a useful tool for specifically abrogating activation
of Rel by starved ribosomal complexes. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of two novel
mutations in the ZFD domain: R619E (R629E in E. coli RelA) as well as a double C602A/C603A
substitution (C612A/C613A in E. coli RelA). While these mutations do not completely abrogate the
activation, acting in epistasis they can be employed to reveal weaker phenotypes / effects, as it was
shown in the current work when the mutations were combined with RRM / ACT deletion.

Finally, we would like to draw the attention of the research community working on long RSH
enzymes to technical aspects of protein purification. It is common to purify Rel/RelA for biochemical
experiments using a single-step Ni-NTA purification (for example (Gratani et al., 2018;Wood et al.,
2019)). However, both RelA (Turnbull et al., 2019) and Rel have a strong tendency for RNA
contamination and multiple additional steps are necessary to remove this contaminant. Therefore,
reporting the 260/280 absorbance ratio of the final preparations is essential. RNA-free protein
preparations typically have a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 0.57, but this parameter can vary
depending on the amino acid composition, specifically the abundance of tryptophan and
phenylalanine (Layne, 1957). Without extra steps to remove RNA contamination, single-step
preparations are likely to be heavily RNA-contaminated. This contamination can potentially explain
the surprising observation that Ni-NTA purified S. aureus Rel inhibits the DEAD-box RNA helicase
CshA (Wood et al., 2019): the RNA contamination may be acting as a competitor in the CshA
helicase assay. RNA contamination also interferes with the estimate of the oligomerisation state of
Rel: since the RNA-bound protein elutes much earlier than the RNA-free (Figure 2BC). For
example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rel elutes as several peaks from SEC (Avarbock et al., 2005),
with the ‘trimer’ (i.e. RNA-contaminated) fraction having lower enzymatic activity. This is likely
because the RNA interferes with ‘trimer’ Rel activation by starved ribosomal complexes.

Figure 2. Purification of RNA-free untagged B. subtilis Rel. N-terminally His10-SUMO tagged
RelA was overexpressed and purified as described in detail in Materials and Methods. (A) Cells were
lysed and subjected to immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Zn2+-charged
HisTrap 5 mL HP column. The fraction corresponding the Rel with the lowest contamination of
nucleic acids (highlighted in yellow) was carried forward. Size-exclusion chromatography on HiLoad
16/600 Superdex 200 pg was used to further separate the RNA-free Rel fractions (B: full-length wild
type Rel; C: DRRM Rel). Following the buffer exchange on HiPrep 10/26 desalting column (D), the
boxed-out fractions were pooled and the His10-SUMO tag was cleaved off by His6-Ulp1 protease. (E)
His6-Ulp1 and the His10-SUMO tag was then purified from native untagged Rel by the second round

Figure 3. Toxicity of ΔRRM E. coli RelA is mitigated by mutations compromising interactions
with tRNA and the ribosome. (A) E. coli BW25113 cells were transformed with low copy IPTG
inducible vector pNDM220 (vector) or pNDM220-based constructs expressing wild-type and mutant
versions of E. coli RelA as indicated on the figure. Ten-fold serial dilutions of overnight LB cultures
were made and spotted onto LB agar (LA) supplemented with 30 µg/mL ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG.
(B) Thousand-fold dilution of the same overnights were made in LB supplemented with 30 µg/mL
ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG, and growth was at 37 °C was monitored using Bioscreen C growth curve
analysis system. Doubling time (Td) was calculated from three independent measurements and the
error bars represent standard errors.

Figure 4. Deletion of the regulatory RRM domain leads to B. subtilis Rel toxicity due to
ribosome-dependent (p)ppGpp overproduction. (A) Full-length (VHB155 and VHB183) as well
as C-terminally truncated Rel variants [synthesis-competent ΔRRM (VHB159 and VHB184),
ΔRRMΔZFD (VHB160 and VHB185) and RelNTD (VHB161 and VHB186), and the corresponding
synthesis-inactive D264G mutants VHB162-164; VHB187-190] were expressed in either ppGpp0
(test for toxicity mediated by (p)ppGpp accumulation) or Drel (test for HD functionality) B. subtilis
growing on solid LB medium. Expression of RelDRRM causes growth defect in liquid culture. Either
wild-type rel (VHB183) (B) or rel∆RRM mutant (VHB184) (C) were expressed in ppGpp0 background
grown in liquid LB medium at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by IPTG added to final
concentration of 1 mM to exponentially growing bacterial cultures at OD600 0.2. Protein expression
was monitored by Western blotting using anti-Rel antibodies. (D) Toxicity of mutant versions of
RelDRRM tested in ppGpp0 B. subtilis growing on solid LB medium: wild type RelDRRM (VHB184),
H420E (VHB231) defective in recognition of tRNA’s 3' CCA end, and ZFD mutants C602AC603A
(VHB233) and R619E (VHB281) defective in 70S binding. LB plates were scored after 18 hour
incubation at 37 °C. (E) Synthesis activity of Rel mutants probed by amino acid auxotrophy assays.
B. subtilis strains were constructed using either relP+ relQ+ wild type 168 (upper row) or ∆relP ∆relP
(lower row) background. The strains either expressed indicated rel mutants (H420E (VHB68) and
C602A C603A (VHB148), upper row, and H420E (VHB60), C602A C603A (VHB62), lower row)
or contained additional ∆rplK gene disruption (VHB47, relP+ relQ+ and VHB49, ∆relP ∆relP). The
ppGpp0 mutant strain (∆relP ∆relP ∆rel, VHB63) was used as a control (highlighted with grey box).
The strains were grown on either solid Spizizen minimal medium (right panel) or solid minimal
medium supplemented with 0.025% casamino acids (left panel). (F) C-terminally truncated Rel
variants (either synthesis-competent (VHB155, VHB159-161) or synthesis-inactive D264G mutant

versions (VHB156, VHB162-164)) were expressed in ppGpp0 B. subtilis growing on either solid
minimal medium or solid minimal medium supplemented with 0.025% casamino acids. Plates were
scored after 36 hours incubation at 37 °C. Importantly, prior to experiment all strains were precultured on solid minimal medium supplemented with 0.025% casamino acids. This was done in
order avoid the effects caused by the decreased fitness of the inoculum.

Figure 5. Deletion of the regulatory RRM domain destabilises Rel binding to starved ribosomal
complexes and does not abrogate the hydrolysis activity. (A) Polysome profile and immunoblot
analyses of Rel variants expressed either ectopically under the control of IPTG-inducible Phy-spnak
promotor [DRRM Rel in ppGpp0 B. subtilis (VHB184), R619E Rel in Drel B. subtilis (VHB282)] or
from the native chromosomal locus [C602A C603A mutant (VHB144)]. Expression RelDRRM was
induced by 1 mM IPTG for 10 minutes followed by a 10 minute challenge with 700 nM mupirocin.
To drive the expression of RelR619E Rel the strain as grown in LB supplemented with 1 mM IPTG.
In the case of R619E and C602AC603A Rel the culture was treated with mupirocin for 20 minutes.
(B) Effect of the RRM deletion on Rel pppGpp-hydrolysis activity. (C) Effects of RRM deletion and
R619E mutation on Rel synthetic activity either alone or in the presence of either initiation and
starved ribosomal complexes. The error bars represent standard deviations of the turnover estimates
by linear regression.
