Abstract:

26

The benefits of group living mostly surpass the disadvantages like sharing of resources and competition over

27

food, space and mates, driving the evolution of social organization. Group living can be facilitated by social

28

tolerance and cooperation among the group members. Social canids (e.g. wolves) display cooperative breeding,

29

hunting, and prosocial activities in different contexts. Unlike cooperative pack-living wolves (Canis lupus

30

lupus), their descendants, domesticated dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), show varying levels of associations from

31

solitary to stable social groups. Free-ranging dogs are group-living but prefer to forage solitarily, hence

32

providing an excellent opportunity for investigating social tolerance and coordinated task performance among

33

the members in various situations. We tested 113 adult-only groups of free-ranging dogs in three different tasks

34

to investigate group responses and performance in problem-solving situations in the presence of an unfamiliar

35

human. Task 1 (unfamiliar, single food reward) and 2 (familiar, single food reward) examined group responses

36

and cooperation from the perspective of familiarity, while Task 3 (familiar, multiple food rewards) enabled us to

37

test whether increased food rewards promote social tolerance and food sharing among the group members.

38

Regardless of significantly higher performance in Task 2 compared to Task 1, cooperation and food sharing

39

were significantly lower in both. Task 3 revealed a strong positive correlation between food sharing and social

40

tolerance, but not between success and social tolerance, suggesting a tendency for cooperation. We conclude

41

that context-dependent cooperation and tolerance among group members facilitate group-living in free-ranging

42

dogs.

43

Significance statement: Group living is a common phenomenon in the animal world where the members of a

44

group show social tolerance and co-operative behaviours towards each other. This need for cooperative intents

45

increases manifolds while groups face different problem-solving situations in their day to day lives. Here, we

46

tested a large number of free-ranging dog groups to understand general cooperative intents such as social

47

tolerance and food sharing in different problem-solving conditions. We found shreds of evidence of context-

48

dependent cooperation and social tolerance among group members with minimal display of aggression. It is not

49

adaptive for the dogs to fight or display aggression over resources. Alternatively, use of subtle cues such as

50

display of dominance and subordination seem to be more plausible mechanisms for the development of efficient

51

scavenging strategies and maintaining hierarchy.

52

Keywords: Group living, free-ranging dogs, task familiarity, cooperation, social tolerance.

Introduction:

55

A wide range of species display differing levels of social organization, from loose groups like herds, to highly

56

organized societies like in the social insects. Group-living requires cooperation among individuals (Buss 1981;

57

McCallum et al. 1985) and simultaneous or co-ordinated actions over varied tasks like foraging (Clark and

58

Mangel 1986), hunting (Packer and Ruttan 1988; Stander 1992; Creel 1997), protection of nests (Lazaro-Perea

59

2001; Schradin 2004; Brown 2013), rearing of offspring (Stacey and Ligon 1991; Clutton-Brock 2002), etc.

60

Social behaviour has evolved as an evolutionarily stable strategy across taxa, through multiple selection events,

61

as the advantages of living in groups compensates for the obvious disadvantages involved in the process, like

62

the sharing of resources (Axelrod and Hamilton 1981; Kapheim et al. 2015). Sociality involves the emergence

63

of coordination among members and subsequent cooperation through resolution of conflict, and is thus a

64

dynamic process (Monnin and Ratnieks 1999; Connor 2000; Franz et al. 2013). Intragroup cooperation

65

sometime helps to enhance the fitness of the members through increased reproduction, while in some cases,

66

cooperation is imperative for survival in a harsh environment (Gittleman 1989; Ebensperger et al. 2012).

67

Cooperation has been suggested to correlate with high social tolerance and low aggression towards group

68

members (Werdenich and Huber 2002; Scott 2006). Thus, studying basic components of cooperation, like food

69

sharing, social tolerance, allo-parenting etc. can help to develop an understanding of the evolution of group

70

dynamics in species.

71

Canids display a wide diversity of social organization from large groups or packs found in species like wolves

72

(Fox 1971; Macdonald 1983), dholes (Macdonald 1983), etc. to species that live in small groups like foxes (Fox

73

1971; Lloyd 1981) and jackals (Macdonald 1983). Descendants of the gray wolves, the domestic dogs (Canis

74

lupus familiaris) are an interesting example of canids that can live as pets and also in social groups with

75

interesting social dynamics, as free-ranging populations (Sen Majumder et al., 2014; Paul and Bhadra 2018).

76

Though most of our current understanding of the behaviour, cognitive abilities and evolutionary history of dogs

77

is based on studies with pets, majority of the world’s dog population is actually free-ranging (Lord et al. 2013),

78

localized mostly in developing nations. They live without direct human supervision in human-dominated

79

habitats (Cafazzo, Valsecchi, Bonanni & Natoli, 2010; Hughes & Macdonald, 2013; Sen Majumder et al.,

80

2014a; Vanak & Gompper, 2009). Several studies have been carried out with individual free-ranging dogs to

81

understand their physical and social cognitive abilities, in contexts like food preference (Bhadra et al. 2016),

82

task-solving (Bhattacharjee, Dasgupta, et al., 2017; Brubaker, Dasgupta, Bhattacharjee, Bhadra, & Udell, 2017)

and interspecific association with humans (Bhattacharjee et al. 2017b, c), but similar studies have not been

84

conducted with groups of free-ranging dogs.

85

Free-ranging dogs live in social groups of varying sizes (2 - 15 individuals, from observations). As scavengers,

86

they forage solitarily most of the time, though this tendency can change during seasons like mating, pup-

87

emergence, etc., when group foraging increases (Sen Majumder et al., 2014). They are known to scavenge

88

together over large and open garbage dumps mostly without conflict and aggression (Bhadra et al., 2016; Sen

89

Majumder et al., 2014). In free-ranging dog groups, mothers provide extensive care to their pups, but also

90

display conflict over food sharing during the weaning period (Paul & Bhadra, 2017; Paul, Sen Majumder &

91

Bhadra, 2014b). Allo-parental care is often observed to be provided by both females and males within groups

92

(Paul, Sen Majumder, & Bhadra, 2014a). Thus, free-ranging dog groups show interesting cooperation-conflict

93

dynamics in contexts of parental care and foraging.

94

It has previously been shown that wolves better cooperate with their pack members in a string-pulling task

95

compared to similarly kept and raised dogs (Marshall-Pescini et al. 2017). Pack-living dogs have been shown to

96

share food with members based on rank positioning, suggesting a role of dominance hierarchy (Dale et al.

97

2017). Moreover, a steeper dominance hierarchy in such dogs compared to similarly raised wolves has also been

98

reported (Range et al. 2015). Unfortunately, studies are greatly lacking pertaining to free-ranging dogs’ group

99

performance and cooperation in problem-solving situations, which could give us insights into the maintenance

100

of group cohesiveness and social hierarchy. Individual free-ranging dogs have been shown to depend on humans

101

when faced with an unfamiliar task, exhibiting proximity-seeking and gazing behaviours (Bhattacharjee et al.

102

2017a). While it is essential to test their behaviours individually, it is also necessary to investigate the group

103

responses to check if the dogs seek help from group members in similar situations and if members of a group

104

help each other to solve a task and share food. We carried out field-based experiments with free-ranging dog

105

groups to test their responses in an unfamiliar (Task 1) and two familiar tasks (Task 2 and Task 3) with different

106

amounts of food rewards in the presence of an unfamiliar human experimenter. Tasks 1 and 2 provided an

107

option of a moderately large piece of raw chicken as a food reward, while Task 3 provided a considerably higher

108

amount of food reward in a familiar set-up. In Tasks 1 and 2, we checked how familiarity influences the

109

problem-solving ability of dogs when present in groups. Task 3 differed from the other two tasks as it did not

110

exclusively involve problem-solving but simulated a scavenging situation that involved searching for and

111

obtaining food rewards and allowed for higher options of food sharing. Task 3 further allowed us to investigate

social tolerance among group members. Our study was aimed to understand the social tolerance of free-ranging

113

dogs in their natural groups, group task performance and other associated factors like gazing at humans and

114

conspecifics in entirely different contexts. We expected that free-ranging dog groups would perform better in

115

the familiar tasks (Task 2 and 3) than the unfamiliar one (Task 1) and show tolerance among members by

116

sharing abundant resources (Task 3). Based on earlier observations, we also hypothesized that dogs would gaze

117

more towards the human experimenter in the unfamiliar task.

118

Materials and Methods:

119

A. Subjects and Study Sites:

120

The study was carried out in different parts of West Bengal, India. We tested a total of 113 groups of adult free-

121

ranging dogs (summing up to a total of 434 dogs) with group sizes ranging from 3 to 10 (3.65 ± 1.26).

122

Individuals (≥ 3) that were sighted either resting or moving together, with not more than 1 m distance in

123

between, were considered as a group. We used three different tasks for the study. Each group was tested only

124

once with a randomly assigned task. The study was carried out at random locations including residential areas,

125

market places, bus stops, and railway stations between 0900 hours and 1700 hours, during April – July 2016.

126

We carried out the trials in different locations to eliminate the possibility of re-testing a group. Besides, a large

127

area (~ 456 sq km) was covered to eliminate any re-sampling completely. We relied on the coat colour, scar

128

marks and specific colour patches on the body of the dogs as distinguishing characters for individuals, and the

129

territorial nature of the dogs as identities of the groups tested.

130

B. Experimental Procedure:

131

As mentioned above, three different tasks were used in the study, with each group being tested for only one task.

132

For each task, the experimenter (E) walked on random streets in a pre-selected locality in search of groups of

133

free-ranging dogs. On sighting a group, E tried to attract the attention of the individuals by calling out to them

134

prior to the commencement of the trial (see Bhattacharjee et al 2017). All the groups which responded and

135

approached E were used for the task subsequently. Tasks were recorded by a cameraperson from a distance to

136

avoid any interactions with the dogs.

137

Task 1: Free-ranging dogs are accustomed to scavenging from garbage bins, open garbage or closed plastic bags

138

carrying food and/or garbage. This task was designed to mimic a scavenging condition but from an unfamiliar

139

source. It required the dogs to obtain food from a transparent plastic container (0.11 m x 0.11 m x 0.06 m) that

140

had a hole pierced in one corner of the lid through which a nylon rope (length – 0.2 m) had been inserted and

141

attached such that pulling the rope could open the lid of the box. In an earlier experiment, individual free-

142

ranging dogs have been observed to attempt the task but failed to solve it on most occasions (Udell 2015;

143

Brubaker et al. 2017; Bhattacharjee et al. 2017a). Hence this task was considered to be suitable for testing if

144

group members would cooperate to solve the task. E allowed the dogs of the focal group to sniff a boneless raw

145

chicken piece (approximately 0.05 – 0.06 kg in weight) and placed it inside the box. E then placed the box on

146

the ground, approximately 1 m away from the focal group and approximately equidistant to the group members,

147

and moved back to a distance of 0.5 m. Thus, the initial distance between E and the dogs was approximately 1.5

148

m. E stood in a neutral posture and looked straight ahead without bending his/her head or making eye contact

149

with any of the focal group dogs. The response was recorded for 120 seconds or until the dogs ate the raw

150

chicken piece, whichever was earlier, following which the food was removed. Forty-four adult dog groups were

151

tested for this task.

152

Task 2: In this task, we provided dog groups with a piece of raw chicken as a reward, placed inside a transparent

153

plastic bag (0.19 m x 0.11 m). The experimenter allowed dogs of the focal group to sniff the chicken piece

154

before placing it inside the plastic bag and tying the mouth of the bag with a thread, allowing the dogs to watch

155

the process (Bhattacharjee et al. 2017a). All the other steps were as in Task 1 and the response was recorded for

156

120 seconds. 43 adult dog groups were tested for this task.

157

Task 3: In this condition, the dog groups were provided with one open plastic basket (0.30 m x 0.07 m x 0.14 m)

158

containing non-edible garbage (dry paper, plastic, leaves etc.) and food rewards, thus emulating a garbage bin

159

(Fig 1). The food reward consisted of five pieces of raw chicken and five pieces of bread (representing proteins

160

and carbohydrates respectively), which were mixed with the garbage, as is the case in most waste disposal sites

161

that are accessible to free-ranging dogs in India. Since the task, in this case, did not involve opening the basket

162

to reach the food, the time provided for the task was 60 seconds, instead of 120 seconds, starting after the basket

163

was placed on the ground. All other steps were the same as in the other two tasks. 26 adult dog groups were

164

tested for this task.

165

The nature of the three tasks differed in terms of their familiarity, quantity of rewards, and to some extent

166

difficulty. Task 1 had earlier been shown to be solved by individual free-ranging dogs, suggesting no physical

167

limitation on part of the dogs. However, a small success rate could be addressed by ‘task difficulty’ along with

168

unfamiliarity, also, Task 2 was highly familiar for these dogs from a scavenging perspective and solved at a

169

higher rate compared to Task 1 (Bhattacharjee et al. 2017a). In order to eliminate any anthropomorphic bias, we

170

have emphasized the familiarity of the tasks (Task 1 and 2), rather than their difficulty levels. Task 3

171

represented a condition which did not involve problem-solving but allowed us to understand co-feeding and

172

social tolerance. To be better able to understand the various projections of our study, we first compared Task 1

173

and 2 in order to check for an effect of familiarity and cooperation and later analysed Task 3 (compared a few

174

parameters with tasks 1 and 2) to address whether changes in the quantity of available food resources potentially

175

promotes sharing behaviour/ social tolerance in free-ranging dogs.

176

C. Data analysis and statistics:

177

All the videos of task performance and associated behaviours were coded by an individual, which were then

178

used for further analysis. Another individual, blind to the experiment, coded 20% of the data selected randomly.

179

Reliability for success, latency, persistence and gazing measures was found to be high (success: Cohen’s kappa

180

= 0.99; latency: kappa = 0.99; persistence: kappa = 0.96; gazing: kappa = 0.97). Shapiro-Wilk tests were

181

conducted to check for normality of the data. The data were not normally distributed. Thus we performed non-

182

parametric tests. Alpha level was 0.05 throughout the analysis. R Studio and StatistiXL version 1.11.0.0 were

183

used for the analyses.

184

Following is the list of behaviours/parameters that were quantified from the study –

185

(i) Success – Opening the container or plastic bag and obtaining the food reward was considered as a successful

186

event in tasks 1 and 2 respectively. The success rate in a trial of Task 3 was estimated on the basis of the number

187

of food pieces left after 60 seconds. For example, empty basket (all 5 pieces of bread and 5 pieces of chicken

188

eaten) after a trial corresponds to 100% success. We have analyzed success rates at two different ranges – less

189

than 50% and more than or equal to 50%, in order to get an idea of lower and higher success rates respectively.

190

(ii) Latency – The time between the presentation of the task before the dogs and the display of first response,

191

which involved approach within a distance of 0.05 – 0.1m of the task set-up was defined as latency. We used

192

markers (e.g. leaves, small stones) to get an idea of the distances. Latencies for all the dogs in a group were

193

recorded but only the latency of the first dog that approached a task was considered for the analysis.

194

(iii) Persistence – Persistence was defined as the duration of active engagement or involvement in the task. We

195

considered active engagement when dogs showed the following behaviours with the objects (box/bag/basket) -

196

‘touching’, ‘licking’, ‘pulling’, and ‘obtaining the food reward(s)’. Persistence was exclusive of the duration of

8
197

interruptions when dogs were not actively engaged in task solving. Calculation of persistence was cumulative.

198

We quantified (a) Persistence of individuals (persistence of each group member), (b) Group persistence (average

199

persistence of the members of a group) and (c) Persistence of the solving individual (persistence of a group

200

member that finally solved a task, Task 1 and 2 specific).

201

(iv) Cooperation (Task 1 and 2 specific) – Two or more individuals of a group acting together, without

202

aggressive interactions, to solve a task was considered as cooperation or simultaneous engagement at the task.

203

We calculated the number of individuals (at least 2) persisting on a task and the duration of overlap to define

204

cooperation.

205

(v) Social tolerance (Task 3 specific) – Social tolerance was defined as a tendency of the group members to

206

scavenge from the same resource side by side without aggression. In order to measure this, a ‘Tolerance Index’

207

(ToI) was constructed for each individual in a group. ToI intended to evaluate the extent to which the group

208

members performed the task together and was not meant to compute the evolutionary benefits being incurred by

209

the individuals due to such an action.

210

We used the following parameters while constructing ToI:

211

•

212
213

Number of individuals that a focal dog can interact with - for example, in a group of 4 individuals, a
focal dog would be able to interact with a maximum of 3 individuals.

•

Availability of time to solve a task - here we subtracted the latency from the total task duration. For

214

example, in a task of 120 seconds, a focal dog with a latency of 10 seconds would have 110 seconds of

215

time available for cooperation.

216

•

Overlap with other members - we calculated the number of individuals that were already engaged in

217

the task when a focal dog joined. Similarly, the duration of the overlap was also calculated. For

218

example, in a group of 4 individuals, a focal dog’s active engagement with a task overlapped with 2

219

other members of the group for 30 seconds and with another member for 10 seconds. While calculating

220

ToI, we first multiplied the proportion of individuals that the focal dog tolerated (2/3 and 1/3) with the

221

proportion of time available that it spent with each in the task (30/110 and 10/110, considering the

222

availability of task time as 110 sec), and then added the two values {(2/3*30/110) + (1/3*10/110)}.

223
224

•

Leaving – We used two parameters to assess the situation at the point when a focal dog left the task;
the time remaining for the task and the proportion of group members engaged in the task. For example,

9
225

if the above focal dog left the task at 90 seconds while two of the group members were actively

226

engaged with the task at that time, this factor was calculated as 2/3*20/110.

227

We used the following formula to calculate ToI -

[N = (Total group size – 1); i.e., the number of individuals in the group a focal dog can interact with; T = Total

229

duration of the experiment - latency of the focal animal; n1 = number of individuals engaged in the task when

230

the focal dog joins; tn = duration of overlap with xn number of individuals; tL = time remaining for the

231

experiment when the focal dog leaves the task; xL = number of individuals engaged in the task when the focal

232

dog leaves].

233

We calculated the ToI values for the individuals that approached in Task 3. Lesser ToI value of an individual

234

indicated a lower tendency to act together with its group members, i.e., a lower intention for food sharing and

235

cooperation. We also calculated the mean ToI values of the groups to check for any correlation with

236

corresponding success rates.

237

(vi) Food sharing – Sharing of food rewards without aggression among the group members (at least within 2

238

members) was considered as food sharing. For task 3, co-feeding was the proxy for food sharing. Co-feeding

239

was determined by calculating the percentage of group members feeding together in Task 3. For example, in a

240

group of 4 individuals, 100% sharing indicated that all the group members had fed/scavenged together, whereas,

241

75% sharing was recorded when 3 of them was observed to co-feed.

242

(vii) Gazing - The duration of gazing at the upper body of the human experimenter was recorded. Gazing

243

towards the conspecifics was also quantified.

244

(viii) Aggression – Aggressive behaviours were aimed towards the conspecifics and included threatening

245

responses. We quantified the following behaviours as aggressive during the tasks: snarling (aggressive vocal

246

response to a group member), threatening (growling/barking at another dog with alert posture having ears

247

pointed) and biting. Neutral and affiliative responses were treated as no aggression. Affiliative behaviours

248

included proximity seeking, contact seeking, social facilitation, tail wagging, and relaxed posture, while neutral

249

responses were restricted to resting, self-care (scratching, licking, grooming) and general disinterest.

250

(ix) First inspection, highest persistence and retrieval of food reward – Since free-ranging dogs are scavengers,

251

reward). For Task 3 it was difficult to gauge the actual amount of food obtained by an individual but we

254

assumed the time spent by an individual in feeding as a correlate of the amount of food eaten. Groups that failed

255

to obtain food rewards were not considered for this calculation.

Results

258

Task 1 vs Task 2:

259

(i) Success - The dog groups performed significantly better in Task 2 than in Task 1 (Fig. 2). Success rates for

260

Task 2 and 1 were 95% and 23% respectively (Chi-squared goodness of fit, χ2 = 45.547, dCohen = 2.096, N = 87,

261

df = 1, p < 0.0001).

262

(ii) Latency – Latencies varied significantly between Tasks 1 and 2 (Mann-Whitney U test, U = 1160.500, dCohen

263

= 0.45, N = 86, df1 = 43, df2 = 43, p = 0.04). Individuals from one group did not respond in Task 1 and hence

264

the total sample size reduced by 1 to 86. Dogs showed significantly faster response (1.16 ± 0.37 sec) in Task 2

265

as compared to Task 1 (1.60 ± 0.90 sec).

266

(iii) Persistence – (a) Persistence of individuals - members of a group that approached a task were considered for

267

the analyses (Sample size: Task 1 – 126, Task 2 – 92). We obtained no difference between Tasks 1 and 2

268

(Mann-Whitney U test, U = 6288.000, dCohen = 0.145, df1 = 126, df2 = 92, p = 0.286). (b) Group persistence –

269

Average persistence of the groups did not differ between Tasks 1 and 2 (Mann-Whitney U test, U = 997.000,

270

dCohen = 0.093, df1 = 44, df2 = 43, p = 0.670). (c) Persistence of the solving individuals - There was no

271

significant difference in persistence between the individuals that finally solved Tasks 1 and 2 (Mann-Whitney U

272

test, U = 218.000, d Cohen = 0.086, df1 = 10, df2 = 41, p = 0.770).

273

(iv) Cooperation – We found a difference in the duration of cooperation between the tasks (Mann-Whitney U

274

test, U = 1813, d Cohen = 0.793, df1= 54, df2 = 47, p < 0.0001). Groups in Task 1 engaged with the task together

275

longer (4.94 ± 6.37 sec) compared to Task 2 (1.08 ± 1.62). In both the tasks, ‘pairs’ from the groups were seen

276

as cooperating units more often than ‘triads’ and ‘tetrad or more’ (Task 1 - Kruskal-Wallis test, χ2 = 15.648,

277

dCohen = 1.209, df = 2, p < 0.0001, Task 2 - Kruskal-Wallis test, χ2 = 28.224, dCohen = 2.429, df = 2, p < 0.0001,

278

Fig 3, Supplementary Text 1).

279

(v) Food sharing – We found absolutely zero sharing of food in Tasks 1 and 2. None of the group members

280

shared the retrieved food rewards with their conspecifics.

11
281

(vi) Gazing – Dogs gazed at the human experimenter significantly more than the conspecifics in Task 1 (Mann-

282

Whitney U test, U = 29424.500, d Cohen = 2.639, df1 = 175, df2 = 175, p < 0.0001). However, in Task 2, there

283

was no such difference (Mann-Whitney U test, U = 13675.500, dCohen = 0.118, df1 = 160, df2 = 160, p < 0.291).

284

(vii) Aggression – Dogs displayed very less aggression towards their group members in both the tasks.

285

Approximately 7% and 14% of the dogs showed aggressive behaviours in Tasks 1 and 2 respectively; the level

286

of aggression was comparable between the two tasks (Chi-squared goodness of fit, χ2 = 2.333, dCohen = 0.332, N

287

= 87, df = 1, p = 0.12). Aggression was less compared to all the other (both affiliative and neutral together)

288

behaviours displayed during the tasks (Task 1: Goodness of fit, χ2 = 32.818, dCohen = 3.426, N = 44, df = 1, p <

289

0.0001; Task 2: Goodness of fit, χ2 = 22.349, dCohen = 2.080, N = 43, df = 1, p < 0.0001).

290

(viii) First inspection, highest persistence and retrieval of food reward – A total of 51 groups of dogs

291

successfully solved Tasks 1 and 2 (Task 1 –10, Task 2 – 41). We pooled data from both the tasks to estimate the

292

proportion of groups in which the first individual to respond to the task was also the one to have persisted the

293

longest and solved the task. In 37 out of 51 groups, the individual which inspected a task first showed highest

294

persistence and also retrieved the reward. We found a difference between the groups that showed a first

295

inspection – highest persistence – retrieval of food reward strategy and groups that did not (Goodness of fit, χ2 =

296

10.373, dCohen = 1.01, N = 51, df = 1, p = 0.001).

297

Task 3:

298

(i) Success - Out of 26 groups, only 3 groups showed 100% success and 2 groups showed zero success.

299

However, we found no difference between the two ranges of the success rates considered for Task 3 (lower (<

300

50%) and higher - (≥ 50%) success rates; Chi-squared goodness of fit, χ2 = 1.385, dCohen = 0.474, N = 26, df = 1,

301

p = 0.239), indicating a somewhat uniform distribution between 0% - 100% (Fig 4).

302

(ii) Latency – Dogs appeared to be quite hesitant in approaching Task 3 (6.84±7.26 sec). Latency of the dogs in

303

Task 3 differed from both Task 1 (Mann-Whitney U test, U = 881.000, dCohen = 1.094, df1 = 43, df2 = 26, p <

304

0.001) and 2 (Mann-Whitney U test, U = 972.000, dCohen = 1.563, df1 = 43, df2 = 26, p < 0.001).

305

(iii) Persistence – (a) Persistence of individuals – A total of 58 individuals, considering all the groups, persisted

306

in Task 3. Persistence of individuals was found to be higher in Task 3 compared to individuals in Task 1 (Mann-

307

Whitney U test, U = 5875.500, dCohen = 1.118, df1 = 126, df2 = 58, p < 0.001) and Task 2 (Mann-Whitney U

308

test, U = 4184.500, dCohen = 1.088, df1 = 92, df2 = 58, p < 0.001).

12
309

(b) Group persistence – We found the average group persistence between the three tasks to be significantly

310

different (Kruskal-Wallis test, χ2 = 27.053, dCohen = 1.086, df = 2, p < 0.0001). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons

311

revealed similar outcomes as found in individual persistence. In Task 3, groups showed higher persistence

312

compared to Task 1 (Mann-Whitney U test, U = 962.000, dCohen = 1.375, df1 = 44, df2 = 26, p < 0.0001) and

313

Task 2 (Mann-Whitney U test, U = 929.500, dCohen = 1.325, df1 = 43, df2 = 26, p < 0.0001).

314

(iv) Social tolerance – ToI values of the all the dogs ranged between 0 and 1 (0.22 ± 0.31). We found a strong

315

positive correlation between food sharing in the groups and their ToI values (Spearman rank correlation, rs =

316

0.816, df = 26, p < 0.001, Fig 5). However, there was no correlation between success rates (feeding) of the

317

groups and their ToI values (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.281, df = 26, p = 0.164).

318

(v) Gazing - Dogs displayed higher gazing at the conspecifics than the human experimenter in Task 3 (Mann-

319

Whitney U test, U = 6080.000, dCohen = 0.425, df1 = 99, df2 = 99, p = 0.003).

320

(vi) Aggression – Close to 11% of the dogs elicited aggressive responses towards their group members.

321

Aggression was significantly less compared to neutral and affiliative behaviours together (Goodness of fit, χ2 =

322

15.385, dCohen = 2.407, N = 26, df = 1, p < 0.0001).

323

(vii) First inspection, highest persistence and retrieval of food reward – We considered 22 groups that responded

324

and persisted in Task 3 for this calculation. Similar to Task 1 and 2, we found groups that showed the 1-1-1

325

condition higher in Task 3 (Goodness of fit, χ2 = 8.909, d Cohen = 1.649, N = 22, df = 1, p = 0.003).

326

Discussion:

327

Our study revealed that free-ranging dog groups performed better in the familiar task (Task 2) as compared to

328

the unfamiliar one (Task 1) when faced with tasks with single food rewards. This was consistent with the earlier

329

findings with individual free-ranging dogs and further substantiates dogs’ inferior abilities in physical cognitive

330

task solving situations like string pulling (Osthaus et al. 2005; Bhattacharjee et al. 2017a). Dogs also showed a

331

much faster reaction to Task 2 than Task 1, emphasizing the role of familiarity (Bhattacharjee et al. 2017a). In

332

case of Task 3, the uniform distribution of success rates across 0 – 100% did not help in providing any useful

333

insights into the free-ranging dogs’ scavenging abilities. In spite of its familiar nature, dogs took longer to

334

approach the set-up in Task 3 relative to the other tasks. Such outcomes could be attributed to fear or hesitation

335

due to the unusual way of food provisioning by an unknown human. Free-ranging dogs in India are generally

336

reluctant to approach garbage bins while humans are still around for disposal of garbage/leftover food as, in

337

such cases, dogs are, typically, shooed away, threatened or beaten by people. A very recent study quantifying

338

free-ranging dog’s scavenging efficiency reported similar results (Sarkar et al. 2019) Thus, we suspect the

339

reasons mentioned above to be the cause for longer approach time of dogs in Task 3.

340

Dogs displayed higher cooperation in Task 1 compared to Task 2, which could be attributed to an unfamiliar

341

nature and difficulty level of the task. However, success did not depend on cooperation in those tasks. We also

342

reckon two underlying factors that could have influenced the outcomes - (i) non-availability of a set-up where

343

group members of a large group can perform together, and (ii) presence of a moderately large single food

344

reward. It was also noted that members who inspected a task first, persisted more and obtained the food reward

345

and no food sharing was observed in any of the two tasks. This is suggestive of the presence of a feeding

346

hierarchy in free-ranging dog groups, as aggression over the reward was not observed. It is difficult to examine

347

and disentangle the factors mentioned above with the current experimental set-up and require further

348

experimentation. The shortcomings were overcome to some extent with the experimental design of Task 3. It

349

provided evidence of social tolerance, co-feeding and thereby general cooperation among the group members

350

when higher food rewards were available. The minimal display of aggressive behaviour towards each other also

351

corroborated the existence of some level of understanding of hierarchy within the group. Both the individual and

352

group average persistence were found to be higher in Task 3, which could be attributed to the lower effort

353

required to find food and the higher quantity of food available. In a nutshell, differing food levels affected the

354

group responses strikingly.

355

Gazing responses provided significant information relating to both intra and interspecific communication.

356

Gazing has been considered as a striking means of communication in canids (Miklósi et al. 2000; Hare and

357

Tomasello 2005). It has previously been shown that dogs gaze at human experimenters when faced with

358

unfamiliar or difficult tasks (Szetei et al. 2003; Udell 2015; Brubaker et al. 2017; Bhattacharjee et al. 2017a).

359

The higher rates of gazing at the human experimenter in Task 1 could be associated with information seeking.

360

This statement is further strengthened by the lack of gazing responses during Task 2, when the dogs faced a

361

familiar task that they could solve independently (Bhattacharjee et al. 2017a). However, this does not rule out

362

the chances of dogs being vigilant or alert when encountering an unfamiliar human at proximity. Relatively

363

higher gazing at the group members during Task 3 is likely to be used for figuring out other group members’

364

intentions to approach the task. Studies have concluded that being able to estimate the intentions of others is

365

vital across social contexts like maintenance of social cohesiveness (Cheney et al. 1986; Friedkin 2004),

366

availing sneaky mating opportunities (Alberts et al. 2003), territorial defence (Crockford et al. 2012),

367

challenging the higher ranking individuals to take over a group (Rowell 1974) etc. It might also help dogs to

368

maintain cohesion and structure within the group during scavenging.

369

Members of free-ranging dog groups seemed to lack the tendency to perform together in solving physical

370

cognitive tasks, but they do show tolerance towards each other, resulting in considerably higher food sharing.

371

Cooperation in the form of social tolerance and co-feeding is a primer for a higher level of cognitive complexity,

372

which requires coordination and communication between group members. The current set of experiments

373

demonstrate that free-ranging dog groups are capable of showing social tolerance towards group members

374

during scavenging and can also exhibit co-feeding, but further experimentation is required to investigate how

375

the groups are maintained and persist over time. From these experiments, we conclude that free-ranging dogs

376

can cooperate with their group members during scavenging, but choose to do so based on context, e.g. when

377

high rewards are available. This observation substantiates earlier observations that free-ranging dogs tend to

378

scavenge solitarily most of the time, possibly to avoid potential conflict, but forage in pairs or larger groups in

379

social contexts like mating and pup rearing (Sen Majumder et al., 2014). This study provides further testimony

380

to the flexible social organization in these dogs, which demonstrate interesting cooperation-conflict dynamics

381

within their social groups. Free-ranging dogs survive in a human-dominated environment, where aggression

382

between dogs is met with intolerance from humans. Hence, maintaining feeding hierarchies using aggression or

383

fighting over resources is not adaptive for the dogs. On the other hand, the use of subtle cues like display of

384

dominance and subordination through postures and vocalizations might be an effective mechanism for

385

maintaining hierarchies that help to develop efficient scavenging strategies. Long term observations of group-

386

level behaviour of the free-ranging dogs would help to provide deeper insights into how such hierarchies are

387

established and maintained.
