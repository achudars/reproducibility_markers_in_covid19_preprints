Abstract

Root growth relies on both cell division and elongation, which occur in the meristem and
elongation zones respectively. SCARECROW (SCR) is a GRAS family gene essential for root
growth and radial patterning in the Arabidopsis root. Previous studies showed that SCR promotes
root growth by suppressing cytokinin response in the meristem, but there is also evidence that
SCR expressed beyond the meristem is required as well for root growth. Here we report that
SCR promotes root growth by promoting cell elongation through suppression of oxidative stress
response and maintenance of redox homeostasis in the elongation zone. In the scr root, a higher
level of hydrogen peroxide was detected, which can be attributed to down-regulation of
peroxidase gene 3. When stress response was blocked or redox status was ameliorated by the
aba2 or upb1 mutation, the scr mutant produced a significantly longer root with longer cells and
a larger and mitotically more active meristem, even though the stem cell and radial patterning
defects still persisted. We showed that WRKY15, an oxidative responsive gene, was a direct
target of SCR down-regulated in the scr mutant, which suggests that SCR has an active role in
suppressing oxidative stress response. Since hydrogen peroxide and peroxidases are essential for
endodermal differentiation, these results suggest that SCR plays a central role in coordinating
cell elongation, endodermal differentiation, redox homeostasis, and oxidative stress response in
plant root.

Introduction

47
48

As the major organ for nutrient and water uptake, the root system must expand its surface

49

area continuously to meet the need of a growing plant. Continuous growth of the root relies on

50

the mitotic activity of the root apical meristem (RAM) and the maintenance of a functional

51

quiescent center (QC), which is the source of all cells in the root and is hence regarded as the

52

stem cells of the root. However, root length is determined by not only the number of cells but

53

also the final cell size.

54

An essential role for redox homeostasis in stem cell renewal in plants has been established

55

(Tang et al., 2017). While the QC and the RAM are associated with an oxidized environment

56

(Jiang et al., 2003; Takahashi et al., 2004), the elongation zone is more reduced (Tsukagoshi,

57

2015). When the redox potential is altered in the RAM, such as in the Arabidopsis rml1 or app1

58

mutant, the RAM is lost or severely reduced (Del Pozo, 2016; Vernoux et al., 2000). The redox

59

status in the elongation zone also affects root meristem activity, as the RAM becomes larger in

60

the upb1 mutant due to a more reduced redox status in the elongation zone (Tsukagoshi et al.,

61

2010). When the redox status in the elongation zone is more oxidized, cell elongation is

62

inhibited, resulting in a short root phenotype (Mabuchi et al., 2018; Tsukagoshi, 2015).

63

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide, oxygen superoxide, and free

64

oxygen radicals, are normally produced at a low level as a byproduct of the energy generating

65

process in mitochondria, the photosynthesis reaction in chloroplasts, and the photorespiration in

66

peroxisomes, but their levels can be elevated when growth conditions are suboptimal

67

(Choudhury et al., 2017). ROS can also be generated by active mechanisms in some cell types,

68

such as lateral root, root hair, and xylem, where they play a positive role in the cell

69

differentiation programs (Bagniewska-Zadworna et al., 2014; Gapper and Dolan, 2006; Mangano

70

et al., 2016; Orman-Ligeza et al., 2016). In the endodermis, for example, hydrogen peroxide is

71

required for the formation of the Casparian strip, a structure essential to this cell type’s function

72

in selective nutrient uptake and defense against pathogens (Dinneny, 2014; Robbins et al., 2014).

73

Accordingly, many genes involved in hydrogen peroxide formation and catabolism, such as

74

Reactive Oxygen Burst Homolog (ROBH) and peroxidase genes, are highly expressed in the

75

endodermis (Lee et al., 2013). Conceivably, if these genes are expressed abnormally, hydrogen

76

peroxide could accumulate, which in turn would affect root growth. How these antagonizing

77

processes are coordinated to ensure normal growth and development is currently unknown.

78

SCARECROW and SHORT-ROOT (SHR) are key regulators of root growth and

79

development in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the scr and shr mutants, the QC is lost, consequently

80

resulting in the loss of the RAM and cessation of root growth (Di Laurenzio et al., 1996;

81

Helariutta et al., 2000). The scr and shr mutants also have a radial patterning defect, which is

82

characterized by the loss of a cell layer due to the absence of an asymmetric cell division that

83

gives rises to the endodermis and cortex (Di Laurenzio et al., 1996; Helariutta et al., 2000). As

84

expected, SCR is expressed in the QC, the cortex/endodermis initial cell, and the endodermis (Di

85

Laurenzio et al., 1996). In contrast, SHR is expressed in the central stele (Helariutta et al., 2000).

86

However, the SHR protein is able to move into the neighboring cells, including the QC and

87

endodermis (Nakajima et al., 2001), where it forms a heterodimer with SCR (Cui et al., 2007).

88

The SHR-SCR complex in turn activates genes that are involved in cell-cycle and cell-fate

89

determination (Cui et al., 2007; Moreno-Risueno et al., 2015; Sozzani et al., 2010). The SHR-

90

SCR complex also enhances SCR expression through a positive feedback loop, leading to SCR

91

accumulation (Cui et al., 2007). The superfluous SCR protein not only blocks SHR movements

92

but also has an SHR-independent role in sugar response and radial patterning (Cui and Benfey,

93

2009a, b; Cui et al., 2012; Cui et al., 2007).

94

Previous studies have demonstrated a crucial role for QC-expressed SHR and SCR in stem

95

cell renewal and root growth (Sabatini et al., 2003). However, there is also evidence that SHR

96

and SCR expressed in the elongation zone also contribute significantly to root growth

97

(Moubayidin et al., 2016; Sabatini et al., 2003; Sebastian et al., 2015). To elucidate the

98

mechanism by which SCR regulates root growth and development, we have identified SHR and

99

SCR direct targets at the genome scale by ChIP-chip (Cui et al., 2011; Iyer-Pascuzzi et al., 2011;

100

Sozzani et al., 2010). Intriguingly, we found that many SHR and SCR target genes are associated

101

with abiotic stress. In further studies, we showed that the scr mutant is hypersensitive to ABA,

102

suggesting that SCR may play a role in abiotic stress response (Cui et al., 2012). In the present

103

study, we explored the role of SCR in abiotic stress and its relationship to root growth, which led

104

to the finding that SCR promotes root cell elongation by mitigating oxidative stress response as

105

well as maintaining a more reduced cellular redox status.

The root growth defects in scr and shr are alleviated by blockage of ABA signaling
Previously we have shown that the scr mutant is hypersensitive to ABA (Cui et al., 2012).

111

Since ABA is a hormone associated with abiotic stress, this finding raises the interesting

112

possibility that the root growth defect of the scr mutant is due, at least partially, to an abnormal

113

level of abiotic stress or stress response. If this is true, blocking ABA biosynthesis should

114

alleviate the short root phenotype in scr. To test this hypothesis, we generated a double mutant

115

with scr-1 and the ABA deficient mutant aba2-1/gin1-3. As expected, we indeed found that the

116

scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant had significantly longer roots than the scr-1 single mutant (Fig 1A

117

and B). Hence, we have uncovered a new role of SCR in promoting root growth through

118

suppression of abiotic stress response.

119

Since SHR and SCR act in the same pathway in root growth and development (Petricka et

120

al., 2012), we also generated the shr-2 aba2-1 double mutant and examined the effect of the

121

aba2 mutation on root growth of the shr mutant. Although the shr-2 aba2-1 root was also longer

122

than that of the shr-2 mutant (Fig S1A and B), the improvement was much less than for the scr-1

123

aba2-1 double mutant. This is not totally surprising, as previously we have shown that SHR and

124

SCR have distinct roles in radial patterning (Cui and Benfey, 2009b; Cui et al., 2011), cytokinin

125

homeostasis (Cui et al., 2011), and sugar signaling (Cui et al., 2012).

126
127

The aba2 mutant enhanced RAM activity, but does not rescue the radial patterning and

128

stem cell defect, in the scr and shr mutants

129

The longer root of the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant could result from a larger root meristem,

130

higher mitotic activity, rescued stem cells and/or radial patterning. To distinguish among these

131

possibilities, we first examined the RAM in the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant, the scr-1 single

132

mutants, and the wild type. As shown in Fig 1C, the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant clearly had a

133

larger meristem that the scr-1 single mutant. In line with this observation, the scr-1 aba2-1

134

double mutant also had a greater number of cortical cells in the meristem zone (Fig 1C). To

135

examine mitotic activity in the RAM, we introduced the CYCB1;1:GUS reporter gene into the

136

different mutant backgrounds. A relatively larger number of cells with GUS activity (Fig 1D)

137

were visible in the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant, indicating a mitotically more active meristem.

138

To determine whether the radial patterning and stem cell defects in the scr mutant were

139

rescued in the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant, we examined the cell organization by confocal

140

microscopy. Interestingly, the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant still had only a single layer of ground

141

tissue characteristic of the scr mutant (Fig 1E). The cells at the QC position in the scr-1 aba2-1

142

double mutant were still disorganized, suggesting that the stem cell defect was not rescued. To

143

further determine the properties of the cells at the QC position, next we examined the presence of

144

starch granules by iodine staining. In wild type and the aba-2 mutant, a starch-free cell layer

145

known as the columella stem cells lies beneath the QC (Fig 1F). In the scr-1 single mutant and

146

the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant, the cells at the corresponding position contain starch grains,

147

indicating the loss of stem-cell property (Fig 1F). Similar results were obtained with the shr-2

148

aba2-1 double mutants (Fig S1, C-E). These results suggest that the improved root growth of the

149

scr-1 aba2-1 and shr-2 aba2-1 mutants can be attributed to enhanced RAM activity.

150
151
152

The scr and shr mutants have an elevated level of reactive oxygen species
Because the scr mutant is hypersensitive to sugar (Cui et al., 2012), next we examined the

153

effects of sugar-signaling mutants on root growth of the scr mutant. Double mutants were

154

generated between scr-1 or scr-4 and the sugar-insensitive mutants gin2-1/hxk1-1, rgs1-2, or

155

abi4-104 (Rolland et al., 2006). Only the rgs1-2 mutation made the scr root grow longer, but to a

156

lesser extent than the aba2-1 mutant (Fig S2). The scr-1 hxk1-1 and scr-4 abi4-104 double

157

mutants even had shorter roots than the scr single mutants (Fig S2). These results suggest that

158

other processes are also altered in the scr mutant.

159
160

Since ROS accumulates under abiotic stress, we reasoned that redox homeostasis might be
compromised in the scr mutants. To test this hypothesis, we compared the level of hydrogen

161

peroxide, a major type of ROS, in the scr mutant and wild type roots using the DAB staining

162

method. As shown in Fig 2, the scr mutant root clearly had a higher level of hydrogen peroxide

163

in the elongation and maturation zones. The shr mutant root also had an elevated level of

164

hydrogen peroxide in the elongation and maturation zones, but to a lesser extent (Fig 2). These

165

results agree with the conclusion that SCR plays a major role in redox homeostasis.

166
167

The aba2 mutant improves root growth in the shr and scr mutants by promoting cell

168

elongation

169

Although ROS inhibit cell division and elongation, our finding that the change in ROS

170

level in the shr and scr mutants occurs in the elongation zone, not in the meristem, raises the

171

interesting possibility that their short-root phenotypes are also due to defect in cell elongation.

172

We therefore measured the length of fully differentiated epidermal cells in the maturation zone.

173

As expected, the result showed that the cells in the shr-2 and scr-1 mutants were dramatically

174

shorter than those in the wild type (Fig 3A). Notably, the cells in the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant

175

were significantly longer than those in the scr-1 single mutant (Fig 3B). The cell length was also

176

increased in the shr-2 aba2-1 double mutant, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig 3C). Based on these

177

results, we conclude that the aba2 mutant improves root growth in the shr and scr mutant

178

backgrounds not only by promoting mitotic activity but also by enhancing cell elongation.

179

Because of the more prominent effect of aba2 on the scr mutant, we have focused on SCR in the

180

rest of this study.

184

The aba2-1 mutant could promote root growth by eliminating ROS or blocking oxidative

185

stress response, or both. To distinguish among these possibilities, we first treated the scr-1 aba2-

186

1 double mutant, the scr-1 and aba2-1 single mutants, and wild type seedlings with 1mM

187

hydrogen peroxide, which inhibits root growth but does not cause cell death according to our

188

previous studies (Cui et al., 2014b). As shown in Fig 4A and C, relative to the scr-1 single

189

mutant, the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant had significantly longer roots, suggesting that the aba2-1

190

mutation confers tolerance to oxidative stress. Next, we examined root growth in medium

191

containing 4% glucose and found that the aba2-1 mutation also confers the scr mutant tolerance

192

to high sugar (Fig 4B and D).

193

Since the scr-1 rgs1-2 double mutant also showed improved root growth, it is possible that

194

the rgs1-2 mutation makes the scr mutant more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide and high sugar as

195

well. Although the scr-1 rgs1-2 double mutant was slightly more tolerant to 4% sugar, it was as

196

sensitive to 1mM hydrogen peroxide as the scr-1 single mutant (Fig S3). This result implies that

197

sugar stress is a minor factor affecting root growth in the scr mutant.

198

To determine whether the aba2-1 mutant blocks ROS formation, we performed DAB

199

staining for hydrogen peroxide in the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant, the scr-1 and aba2-1 single

200

mutants, and wild type. No difference in hydrogen peroxide content was observed between scr-1

201

aba2-1 double mutant and the scr-1 single mutant, and between the aba2-1 mutant and the wild

202

type (Fig 4E). Based on the results in this section, we propose that the aba2-1 mutant alleviates

203

the root growth defect in the scr mutant mainly by mitigating the deleterious effect of oxidative

204

stress.

The scr mutant root growth defect is partially rescued by the upb1 mutant

If the short root phenotype of scr-1 is caused by oxidative stress, ameliorating the cellular

208

redox status or mitigating oxidative stress response should alleviate the root growth phenotype of

209

the scr mutant. To test this idea, we introduced the upb1-1 mutation into the scr-1 mutant,

210

because this mutant has longer roots owing to a more reduced redox status in the root tip

211

(Tsukagoshi et al., 2010). Although the upb1-1 mutation had no apparent effect on root length in

212

our growth conditions, the scr-1 upb1-1 double mutant had significantly longer roots than the

213

scr-1 single mutant, a result that can be ascribed to a larger apical meristem and longer

214

differentiated epidermal cells (Fig 5). Like the scr-1 aba2-1 double mutant, however, the scr-1

215

upb1-1 double mutant still had the stem cell and radial patterning defects characteristic of scr.

216

This result lends further support to the notion that SCR promotes root growth by suppressing the

217

oxidative stress response.

218
219

Peroxidase genes are down-regulated in the scr mutant

220

Peroxidases are an important component of the cellular machinery regulating redox

221

homeostasis. Hence, alteration in their expression could cause ROS accumulation. In the

222

endodermis, several peroxidase (PER) genes are highly expressed, such as PER3, 9, 39, 64 and

223

72 (Lee et al., 2013), which are essential to Casparian strip formation in the endodermis. While

224

converting phenolic compounds into lignin, peroxidase consumes hydrogen peroxide that is

225

generated by NADPH oxidase (Lee et al., 2013), thus maintaining redox homeostasis. Since SCR

226

and SHR are master regulators of endodermal differentiation (Helariutta et al., 2000; Long et al.,

227

2015), it is likely that these peroxidase genes are down-regulated in scr and shr mutants, which

228

would explain the elevated level of hydrogen peroxide in these mutants. To examine this

229

possibility, we first determined the expression pattern of these peroxidase genes in the root tip of

230

wild-type seedlings using previously reported transgenic lines that express the GFP reporter gene

231

under the control of their promoter sequences (Lee et al., 2013). Based on the GFP fluorescence,

232

PER3 appears to be the only peroxidase gene expressed in the elongation zone (Fig 6 and Fig S4).

233

We therefore next compared its expression in the wild type, the scr mutant, and the shr mutant.

234

As expected, PER3 showed a dramatic reduction in its expression in both the shr and scr mutants

235

(Fig 6), suggesting that the elevated level of hydrogen peroxide in the shr and scr mutants is at

236

least partially attributable to down-regulation of PER3.

237
238
239

SCR directly suppresses genes involved in oxidative stress response
Our finding that the aba2-1 mutation was able to improve root growth of the scr mutant

240

without rescuing the redox defect suggests that SCR may play an active role in suppressing the

241

oxidative stress response. In agreement with this notion, among the genes directly repressed by

242

SCR (Cui et al., 2012; Iyer-Pascuzzi et al., 2011), we noticed that some are associated with

243

oxidative stress. One of these genes is WRKY15, which is well known to be an oxidative stress

244

responsive gene (Inze et al., 2012) and whose overexpression has been shown to cause

245

hypersensitivity of the plant to drought (Vanderauwera et al., 2012). According to the cell-type

246

specific RNA-seq dataset (Li et al., 2016), WRKY15 is preferentially expressed in the endodermis

247

(Fig S6), making it more likely a direct target of SCR. We therefore performed ChIP-PCR on the

248

WRKY15 promoter using transgenic plants that express a functional SCR-GFP fusion protein

249

under its endogenous promoter, as previously described (Cui et al., 2014a; Cui et al., 2007). As

250

shown in Fig 7A, SCR binds to a region proximal to the transcription start site of the WRKY15

251

promoter (Fig 7A).

Bars = 50 µm.

252

To determine whether WRKY15 is suppressed by SCR, next we checked WRKY15

253

transcript level in the roots of the shr-2 and scr-1 mutants, as well as the wild type, by RT-PCR.

254

Relative to the wild type, both mutants were found to have a large increase in the transcript level

255

of WRKY15 (Fig 7B). Notably, the change was much more pronounced in the scr mutant than in

256

the shr mutant. To confirm this observation, next we analyzed the expression pattern of WRKY15

257

using the WRKY15pro:GUS reporter construct, which would allow us to address the question of

258

whether the change in WRKY15 expression occurs in the RAM. Consistent with the RT-PCR

259

result, WRKY15 showed at a much higher level in the scr mutant (Fig 7B). Interestingly, the

260

change in WRKY15 expression was seen mainly in the elongation zone in both mutants (Fig 7B).

261

The greater prominence of SCR in regulating WRKY15 expression suggests that SCR’s role

262

in regulating WRKY15 expression may be SHR-independent (Fig 7A), similar to the case with

263

ABI4 (Cui et al., 2012). We therefore examined SHR binding to the WRKY15 promoter by ChIP-

264

PCR similarly as we did with SCR, but using the SHR-GFP fusion protein (Cui et al., 2011; Cui

265

et al., 2007). No apparent binding was detected, indicating that WRKY15 is not a direct target of

266

SHR (Fig 7A). The results described above together suggest that SCR promote root growth by

267

directly actively mitigating the deleterious effect of oxidative response.

SCR promotes root growth through multiple mechanisms
It has been over two decades since SCR was first identified as a key regulator of root

273

growth and development, but only recently have the underlying mechanisms begun to be

274

elucidated. In the scr mutant, Moubayidin et al. found that some cytokinin response genes are

elevated (Moubayidin et al., 2013). In further studies, Moubayidin et al. showed that the

276

meristem defect in the scr mutant could be rescued by mutations in some genes involved in

277

cytokinin signaling, which led them to conclude that SCR promotes root growth by suppressing

278

the cytokinin response (Moubayidin et al., 2013). The rescue is partial, however, suggesting the

279

existence of other mechanisms. Consistent with this, there is evidence that SCR expressed in the

280

elongation and maturation zones is also required for root growth (Moubayidin et al., 2016;

281

Sabatini et al., 2003). In the present study, we showed that this role of SCR can be attributed to

282

its function as a regulator of redox homeostasis and oxidative stress response. Supporting this

283

conclusion, we showed that the scr mutant had an elevated level of hydrogen peroxide in the

284

elongation region, but not in the meristem zone, and that the root growth defect could be partly

285

rescued when abiotic stress response was blocked using the ABA signaling mutant aba2-1 or

286

when cellular redox status was ameliorated using the redox regulator mutant upb1-1. Hence, it

287

seems that SCR promotes root growth at least through two distinct mechanisms: one by

288

repressing cytokinin response in the meristem, and the other by maintaining cellular redox

289

homeostasis and mitigating the oxidative stress response in the elongation zone.

290
291

SCR promote root growth by enhancing cell elongation and mitotic activity

292

It is generally accepted that SCR and SHR promote root growth by maintaining the QC.

293

However, this view has been challenged by recent findings that the root growth defect in the shr

294

and scr mutants can be largely rescued by mutants deficient in cytokinin biosynthesis or

295

signaling while the QC defect still persists (Moubayidin et al., 2013; Sebastian et al., 2015). In

296

the present study, we also found a QC-independent root growth phenomenon – although the scr

13

297

aba2 double mutant had a significantly longer root than the scr single mutant, it still had the QC

298

and radial patterning defects.

299

Cell elongation plays a role, equally significant, if not more, than cell division in plant

300

growth, but the mechanisms regulating root cell elongation have been unclear. In this study we

301

found that SHR and SCR have a previously unrecognized role in promoting cell elongation,

302

which can be attributed to their function in regulating redox homeostasis and oxidative stress

303

response. Using differentiated epidermal cells as a proxy, we first showed that cells in the shr

304

and scr mutant roots were dramatically shorter than those in the wild type. By DAB staining we

305

found that the level of hydrogen peroxide was significantly elevated in the shr and scr mutant

306

roots, and this change was seen in the elongation zone but not in the meristem zone. Consistent

307

with this observation, PER3, an enzyme that consumes hydrogen peroxide for the formation of

308

the Casparian strip, almost completely lost its expression in the elongation zone, whereas

309

WRKY15, an oxidative stress response gene, was up-regulated. Last but not least importantly, the

310

short cell defect in the scr root was largely rescued by the aba2-1 and upb1-1 mutants, which

311

block the abiotic stress response or ameliorate the redox status respectively.

312

Interestingly, the scr-1 aba2-1 and scr-1 upb1-1 double mutant roots also had larger and

313

mitotically more active apical meristems, suggesting that SCR may also promote meristem

314

activity through its role in redox homeostasis and oxidative stress response. Since there was no

315

apparent change in redox status in the meristem zone in the scr mutant, we think that this effect

316

is an indirect consequence of a prolonged phase of cell elongation resulting from an improved

317

growth microenvironment. Many hormones and environmental factors are known to affect the

318

meristem size by promoting cell differentiation (Del Pozo, 2016; Moubayidin et al., 2013). By

14

319

extending the duration of cell elongation, SCR could slow down the cell differentiation program,

320

thereby helping to maintain a larger meristem.

321
322

The role for SCR in redox homeostasis and oxidative stress response is independent of SHR

323

Although SCR acts downstream of SHR in stem cell renewal and radial patterning, our

324

results indicate that SCR plays a more prominent role in redox homeostasis and oxidative stress

325

response. First, relative to the shr mutant, the scr mutant appears to have more ROS. Second,

326

although the root growth defect of the shr mutant was partially rescued by the ABA signaling

327

mutant aba2-1, the effect is less pronounced. Notably, the root growth defect was even not

328

rescued by the upb1-1 mutation. Furthermore, ChIP-PCR assay showed that SCR but not SHR

329

binds to the promoter of WRKY15. This SHR-independent role of SCR is not unexpected, as

330

previously we have shown that ABI4 is also directly regulated by SCR, but not SHR (Cui and

331

Benfey, 2009a). On the other hand, SHR also has an SCR-independent role in cytokinin

332

homeostasis and radial patterning in the stele (Cui et al., 2011; Levesque et al., 2006). Consistent

333

with this, blocking cytokinin signaling in the shr mutant has been shown to be able to restore

334

root growth to the wild-type level, but this only partially rescues the root growth defect in the scr

335

mutant, even though the root growth phenotype is more severe in the shr mutant (Sebastian et al.,

336

2015). The different functions of SHR and SCR can be ascribed partly to their different

337

expression domains and partly to SCR proteins that are not bound by SHR resulting from a

338

feedback mechanism for SCR expression.

339
340

SCR is a key player coordinating cell elongation and endodermal differentiation

15

341

ROS are inhibitory to cell elongation and division and therefore must be removed to ensure

342

normal growth and development. The oxidative stress response must also be suppressed, as it is

343

mounted at the expense of developmental processes. ROS, however, are essential to endodermal

344

differentiation owing to their positive role in Casparian strip formation. SCR resolves this

345

conflict by the repressing oxidative stress response while activating peroxidase expression. This

346

study has thus revealed an important mechanism coordinating multiple processes in root growth

347

and development.

Materials and Methods

349
350
351

Plant materials and treatments
Double mutants were generated by crossing and confirmed by PCR-based genotyping. If

352

the two mutants had genetic backgrounds (Col, Ws or Ler), then mutants as well as wild type in

353

the F2 segregating population were distinguished based on their growth type and seeds in the

354

genetic background were used in the same comparisons. Seeds were surface-sterilized for 5-10

355

minutes using 20% bleach plus 0.1% Tween 20, then washed 4 times with sterile H2O. After

356

storage at 4°C for 1 week for vernalization, the seeds were sowed on growth medium containing

357

1X MS, 0.8% agar (RPI, Cat No. A20400) and 1% sucrose and allowed to germinate in a vertical

358

position in a Percival® growth chamber at 22°C with 16 h daily illumination. For sugar tolerance

359

assay, glucose was added to the standard MS medium to a final concentration of 4%, whereas for

360

hydrogen peroxide treatment 2ml of 1mM hydrogen peroxide solution was added to the surface

361

of the MS growth medium.

362
363

16

364
365

Histochemical staining
GUS staining was performed essentially as described in the Arabidopsis book (Weigel and

366

Glazebrook, 2002). Seedlings were incubated in GUS staining solution overnight at 37°C. For

367

hydrogen peroxide detection, the DAB staining protocol by (Daudi and O'Brien, 2012) was

368

followed. To visualize starch granules, the roots were incubated in Lugol solution (Sigma, L-

369

62650) for half an hour at room temperature (RT), followed by washing with distilled water.

370
371

Microscopy

372

For light microscopy, the roots were first cleared in a drop of chloral hydrate solution (7.5

373

g chloral hydrate dissolved in 3 ml 50% glycerol) on a glass slide for 1-5 minutes. Images were

374

captured using an Olympus BX61 compound microscope. For confocal microscopy, the

375

seedlings were stained in Propidium iodide (Sigma, P-4170) solution (5 µg/ml in ddH2O) for 1

376

minute at RT and imaged with a Zeiss Meta510 confocal microscope.

377

We define the root meristem as the region between the QC and the cells that are two times

378

longer than the meristem cells. To measure the meristem size, we first cleared the roots in chloral

379

hydrate solution, imaged them with an Olympus BX61 compound microscope, and then counted

380

the number of cortex cells in a single file. The epidermal cell length was measured similarly, but

381

with the use of the Image J software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).

382
383
384

Molecular biology assays
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)) was performed as we previously described (Cui et

385

al., 2007), using the GFP antibody (ab290, ABcam, MA) and transgenic plants expressing the

386

SCR-GFP and SHR-GFP fusion proteins under their endogenous promoters in the scr-1 or shr-2

17

387

mutant backgrounds. As a negative control, a mock ChIP was also conducted whereby BSA

388

serum was used instead of the antibody. Quantitative PCR was then performed on the WRKY15

389

promoter using an ABI 7000 real-time thermocycler, with the 18S rDNA as a loading control.

390

The primers used for these experiments are shown in Table S1.

391

For RT-PCR, 1 µg total RNA isolated with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) was first

392

converted into cDNA using the Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen).

393

Quantitative PCR analysis was then conducted using the ABI 7000 real-time thermocycler,

394

similar to the ChIP-PCR using gene-specific primers (Table S1). The 18S rRNA was used as a

395

control for the amount of RNA and reverse transcription.

396
397
398

The CTAB method was used for preparation of genomic DNA used in genotyping and the
primers used for this purpose are listed in Table S1.
