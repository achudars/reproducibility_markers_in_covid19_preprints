Abstract
Integral membrane proteins are regulated by specific interactions with lipids from the surrounding bilayer.
The structures of protein-lipid complexes can be determined through a combination of experimental and
computational approaches, but the energetic basis of these interactions is difficult to resolve. Molecular
dynamic simulations provide the primary computational technique to estimate the free energies of these
interactions. We demonstrate that the energetics of protein-lipid interactions may be reliably and
reproducibly calculated using three simulation-based approaches: potential of mean force calculations.
alchemical free energy perturbation, and well-tempered metadynamics. We employ these techniques within
the framework of a coarse-grained force field, and apply them to both bacterial and mammalian membrane
protein-lipid systems. We demonstrate good agreement between the different techniques, providing a robust
framework for their automated implementation within a pipeline for annotation of newly determined
membrane protein structures.

Introduction
Integral transmembrane proteins have diverse functions within cells, and as such are key targets for many
drugs, ranging from antibiotics to anticancer agents. Structurally, they are unified by the presence of a
hydrophobic span of residues that both anchors the protein within the core of a lipid bilayer membrane and
presents the flanking residues to the surrounding polar lipid head groups. The resulting protein-lipid
interactions are important for function, with many membrane proteins, including e.g. ion channels,
transporters and receptors, regulated by specific lipid interactions 1. Lipid-binding sites thus provide
potential druggable allosteric sites on many biologically-important membrane proteins.
Structural studies of membrane proteins often rely on their extraction from their native bilayer environment
through use of detergents. As a consequence of this, lipids which bind to the protein are often lost before
structural (X-ray diffraction or cryoelectron microscopy) data are gathered. Although there are cases where
X-ray or electron scattering density may be observed for lipids bound to membrane proteins (for examples,
see refs 2–4), the often modest resolution of such data presents challenges to the unambiguous assignment
of the molecular identity of the bound lipid species.
Molecular simulations provide near atomic resolution insights into the interactions of lipids with membrane
proteins. They can both predict the location of lipid binding sites in advance of structural studies

5–7

and

can extend structural observations on the lipid interactions of a given membrane protein to other members
of a protein family 8. In addition to identification of potential lipid interaction sites, for example from

estimates of lipid-protein ‘fingerprints’ 9, molecular simulations can provide estimates of the residence
times of lipids at binding sites on a membrane protein 10 and of free energies of interaction of specific lipids
11,12

.

Validation of computational predictions of specific lipid interactions can be achieved via a number of
biophysical approaches, including e.g. native mass spectrometry (nMS)

13

which can be employed in

tandem with molecular simulation 14. The relatively slow throughput of these techniques however, means
that only a tiny fraction of the possible interactions has so far been identified. Moreover, experimental
quantification of the strength and specificity of protein-lipid interactions remains more challenging, with
notable recent attempts using nMS 15 and surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based methods 16.
Molecular simulations can also be used to quantify the strength of protein-lipid interactions, via free energy
calculations (Figure 1A). Several free energy techniques have been developed for the calculation of binding
free energies between ligands and (water soluble) proteins 17, including online tools for ease of set-up, e.g.
pmx (http://pmx.mpibpc.mpg.de/webserver.html). Many, if not all, of these methods can be modified for
analysis of protein-lipid interactions. Membrane proteins and lipids pose particular challenges of sampling
and convergence for accurate free energy estimation

18

, arising from the relatively slow rates of lipid

diffusion and from the diversity of lipid species present in complex biological membranes 19. To date, most
studies 5,11,18,20,21 have combined umbrella sampling with a potential of mean force (PMF) calculation along
a one-dimensional reaction coordinate connecting the binding site with the surrounding membrane

18

(Figure 1B). Convergence of such calculations (i.e. the point at which additional sampling via additional
simulation does not substantially change the outcome) is often achieved through use of a coarse-grained
(CG) biomolecular force field, such as Martini

22,23

, which allows for efficient sampling of protein-lipid

interactions. Whilst a powerful technique, the difficulty in demonstrating convergence makes this approach
challenging to implement in a high throughout fashion. Furthermore, it is computationally demanding,
requiring ~50+ µs of simulation per protein-lipid interaction, currently equivalent to ~2 weeks on a typical
GPU-node. It is therefore important that we explore additional approaches in order to extend the reach and
to evaluate the robustness of PMF-based estimates of free energies of protein-lipid interactions.
Here, we present an analysis of the determination of protein-lipid binding interactions using PMFs
alongside two other powerful free energy approaches, adapted here for investigation of protein-lipid
interactions. These are free energy perturbation (FEP

24

) or absolute binding free energy (ABFE

25

)

calculations, whereby a molecule is partially or fully perturbed via non-natural (i.e. alchemical) chemical
space (Figure 1D), and well-tempered metadynamics (WTMetaD

26

), where a history-dependent bias is

added to a free energy surface (Figure 1E) to reduce simulation time spent sampling local energy minima.
We compare PMF, FEP/ABFE and WTMetaD in terms of ease of accuracy and computational cost. We

use all three methods on a panel of experimentally well-characterised proteins which are representative of
bacterial, mitochondrial and mammalian cell membranes. Through comparison of the methods applied here
we outline a mechanism for producing robust and reproducible estimates of protein-lipid interactions from
molecular simulations.

Methods
Equilibrium CG simulations
Simulations were run using the CG Martini v2 biomolecular force field 22,23. In this forcefield, molecules
are coarse grained through the representation of approximately 4 heavy atoms and associated hydrogens as
a single bead or particle. Whilst this simplification provides the force field with reduced resolution 27, it has
repeatedly been shown as highly proficient in the identification of specific interactions between proteins
and membrane lipids, including cardiolipin (CDL)
5,14,20

11,21,28,29

, phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PIP2)

, cholesterol 20,30 (Figure 1C) and others.

We follow the MemProtMD protocol for setting up CG simulations of integral membrane proteins in an
equilibrated bilayer 31,32. Briefly, the input proteins are aligned accordingly on the xy plane, and lipids (1palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine;

POPC

or

1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-

phosphoethanolamine; POPE) are placed randomly around the transmembrane region of protein, in a z
range of 8 nm. The starting protein coordinates were used as follows: chicken (Gallus gallus) Kir2.2 ion
channel, PDB code 3SPC

33

; bovine (Bos taurus) AAC transport protein, PDB code 1OKC 4; bacterial

(Aquifex aeolicus) LeuT transport protein, PDB code 2A65

34

(simulated here as a dimer); and human

(Homo sapiens) GPCR A2AR, PDB code 5IU4 35 with the bRIL subunit removed. In each case, non-protein
atoms were removed and any missing loops were added using MODELLER 36 or SWISS-MODEL 37 prior
to CG conversion. Phospholipids were modelled with palmitoyl (4-beads) and oleoyl (5-beads) tails.
Cholesterol was modelled using the virtual-site description 38. Full details of the simulations are given in
the Supporting Methods.
Potential of mean force calculations
PMF calculations were set up and run as described previously

18

. Calculations start from the complex

formed between the protein and target lipid, which is then inserted into a generic membrane (i.e. POPE or
POPC). The lipid is then removed from the protein through application of steered MD, in which a distancedependent pulling force is applied between the lipid head group and the protein. This trajectory then forms
the collective variable (CV) to be analysed. The specific CVs used here are outlined in the Supporting
Methods.

Corey et al.
Snapshots were taken of the system in which the lipid is at specific window along the CV (using a 0.05 nm
spacing for optimal histogram overlap, see e.g. Supporting Figure 1), with each snapshot used to seed an
independent simulation. For these, an umbrella potential with a force of 1000 kJ mol-1 was used to keep the
lipid in place along the reaction coordinate, with 100 kJ mol-1 nm-2 xy positional restraints on 3-4 protein
backbone beads to prevent the protein from rotating during the simulations – details provided in the
Supporting Methods.
Simulations were run for 1 µs to allow convergence (e.g. Supporting Figure 1). The first 200 ns were
removed from each simulation as equilibration, and the final 800 ns were combined into a 1D energy profile
using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) 39, as implemented in gmx wham 40, and employing
200 rounds of Bayesian bootstrapping to report on statistical accuracy. When plotting, the bulk region of
the membrane is considered to have a free energy of 0 kJ mol -1, and the binding energy well is set to 0 nm
on the x-axis.
Note that, as the lipid binding site will either be occupied by the target lipid or a generic bulk lipid, this
analysis will not provide us with Gbind of our target lipid to the site, but instead Gbind between the target
and a generic lipid. This is the biologically appropriate term, as protein-lipid binding will always occur in
competition with other lipids, and the effective affinity of the interaction will be dependent on the nature
of the other lipids present. Accordingly, if you carry out PMF calculations of e.g. POPC in a POPC
membrane, the value reported should be 0 kJ mol-1 (e.g. see ref 21).
Free energy perturbation
The bound PMF systems were used as the input for the FEP calculations. The target lipid was alchemically
transformed into the generic lipid, along a coordinate in chemical space, termed . Additional simulations
were run perturbing the target lipid in bulk membrane (‘free’), i.e. with no protein visible to the lipid.
Gbind can then be calculated as described in Figure 2. This value should be equivalent to that obtained
using PMF calculations.
Charges and Lennard Jones interactions were turned off separately, with a soft-core parameter (sigma=0.3)
used for the Lennard Jones interactions

41,42

. Bonded interactions were not perturbed, as these cancel out

between the bound and free states. For each system, we used a single topology method, where molecule A
is converted into molecule B in a single transformation. Details of the transformation are provided in the
Supporting Methods. In all cases, we used 10 windows to perturb the Columbic interactions, and either 10
(PIP2) or 20 (CDL) windows were used to perturb the Lennard-Jones interactions.

Corey et al.
Each  window was minimized using the steepest descent method, followed by 5 ns of NPT equilibrium.
Five independent production simulations of 250 ns were then run with randomized initial velocities, using
a leap-frog stochastic dynamics integrator.
The free energy pathway was then constructed from the individual  windows using the Alchemical
Analysis package

43

. Energy values were calculated on the final 225 ns of simulation data, with this

simulation length showing good conversion (e.g. Supporting Figure 2). Analysis was run using the MBAR
method

44

, although we observed good agreement between multiple analysis methods (e.g. Supporting

Figure 2). Data from 5 repeats were averaged, and the standard deviations calculated.
Absolute binding free energy calculations
A2AR-cholesterol simulations followed a similar setup as described above, but with the target lipid fully,
rather than partially, decoupled from the simulation box (Supporting Figure 3). To keep the cholesterol
molecule in the binding site and within the correct plane and orientation of the membrane at high values of
, we followed a cholesterol restraining scheme described previously

45

, and outlined in the Supporting

Methods. Gbind was calculated from the energy required to decouple the cholesterol molecule in the
bound and free state, in each case perturbing the Lennard-Jones interactions over 29  windows (with 0.05
spacing from 0 to 0.6, and 0.025 spacing from 0.6 to 1). The energetic input of the restraints accounted for
through two analytical terms (see Supporting Equations 1, 2 and 3), and additional restraint FEP in the gas
phase (see Supporting Figure 3). Simulations were run in Gromacs 2016 (www.gromacs.org) with restraints
imposed using the plumed v2.4 plugin 46,47.
Metadynamics
In classical MetaD, the evolution of the system along the CV is biased by a history dependant potential,
which is the sum of the Gaussians deposited along the relevant CV 48. After a defined period of time, the
biasing potential compensates the underlying Free Energy Surface (FES), allowing the real FES to be
estimated. Use of a fixed Gaussian height gives classical MetaD several limitations, particularly concerning
convergence, as the system can be pushed into regions of configurational space which are not physically or
physiologically relevant. Here we use Well-Tempered MetaDynamics (WTMetaD)

26,49

in which the

Gaussian height is rescaled based upon an adaptive bias (ΔT), which is dependent on the system simulated
26

.

The WTMetaD simulations were made using the protein coordinates built into a simple (POPC or POPE)
membrane as described above, with xyz positional restraints on select backbone particles – details provided
in the Supporting Methods. The WTMetaD simulations were run using 20 walkers placed randomly within

Corey et al.
2.5 nm of the protein. In the A2AR, AAC and Kir2.2 systems, the walkers were constrained from moving
greater than 3.5, 4 and 4.2 nm respectively from the geometric centre of the protein. For LeuT the walkers
were constrained using a minimum distance of 4 nm between the lipid and the geometric centre of each
monomer. To prevent the cholesterol from flip-flopping between leaflets, two additional flat-bottomed
restraints were applied: an angle restraint of one radian was applied between the ROH, C2 beads and the zaxis and a wall parallel to the midpoint of the membrane offset towards the extracellular leaflet by 1 nm
was applied to the ROH bead to prevent the cholesterol from moving vertically between leaflets. In all
simulations the flat bottom restraints were applied using the Plumed UPPERWALLS of 1,000 kJ mol-1 nm2

.

The bias was added along the CV for each system, as defined in the Supporting Methods. The bias-factor
was tuned to each lipid with cholesterol, CDL and PIP2 being 6, 8, and 20 respectively. The following
WTMetaD parameters were applied to all systems: Gaussian width of 0.01 nm, height of 1 kJ mol-1 and a
1 ps deposition rate. All WTMetaD simulations were performed at 310 K using Gromacs 2016 with the
Plumed v2.4 plugin. When plotting, the bulk region of the membrane is considered to have an energy of 0
kJ mol-1.
The bulk Gaussian height of 5 % of the maximum value was used as a metric for the WTMetaD reaching a
steady state (e.g. Supporting Figure 4), at which we see multiple association/disassociation events to the
binding sites. The FES was sampled every 250 ps, whereupon the final 2D FES depicted in the text was
recovered by averaging over the steady state.

Results
We selected a panel of four experimentally well-characterised membrane proteins to represent bacterial,
mitochondrial, and mammalian cell membranes. These were chosen to include examples for which
experimental structural data for protein-lipid interactions are available, for which nMS studies have been
used to demonstrate lipid interactions, and which have been the subject of previous computational studies.
They also represent three species of lipid (Figure 1C) which frequently form interactions with membrane
proteins, namely: PIP2, a negatively charged phospholipid which interacts with many ion channels and
receptors in mammalian cell membranes; CDL, also negatively charged, which is present in mitochondrial
and bacterial inner membranes, and cholesterol, which has been observed to bind to many G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. Thus, we probe the following interactions: of PIP2 with the
mammalian inward rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.2; of CDL with the mitochondrial inner membrane
ADP/ATP carrier protein, AAC

21

and with the bacterial inner membrane leucine transporter, LeuT

34,50

;

and of cholesterol with a GPCR, the adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR).

Corey et al.
Kir2.2-PIP2 binding interactions
Kir2.2 is a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel family, found in neuronal cell membranes,
which play a key role in the regulation of plasticity and neuronal excitation 51. As with other members of
this family, opening of Kir2.2 channels can be activated through interaction with PIP2 52. Structural (X-ray)
studies show PIP2 binds at the interface between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Figure 3A)
to bring about channel opening 33.
Simulations were run to probe the free energy of Kir2.2-PIP2 interactions in a simple phospholipid (POPC)
membrane. Binding sites have previously been identified both structurally 33 and computationally 5,18. We,
therefore, carried out PMF and FEP simulations based on the crystallographic binding pose of PIP2 in order
to estimate the binding free energy. We note that these PMFs provide an interaction free energy for Kir2.2
with PIP2 relative to that with POPC, i.e. the well depth in the PMF can be equated as ΔGbind-PIP2 - ΔGbindPOPC,

or ΔΔGbind(PIP2-POPC), which we shorten to Gbind. Similarly, the FEP analysis provides us with Gbind

(see Figure 2).
The PMF and FEP data agree well, giving similar estimates for Kir2.2-PIP2 interactions (Figure 3B-C; 45±2 kJ mol-1 for PMF and -48±2 kJ mol-1 for FEP). The PMF data reveal the presence of a second binding
site, ~0.5 nm from the main site, with a free energy of interaction of -36±2 kJ mol-1. This alternative pose
of the lipid involves interactions between PIP2 and residue Lys 220, and corresponds to a secondary binding
mode proposed for the closely related Kir2.1 channel 53.
Next, we carried out WTMetaD simulations to explore the multiple PIP2 binding sites on the tetrameric
channel structure. As before, the WTMetaD data allows us to calculate Gbind of PIP2 in relation to POPC.
The data identified the primary binding modes for three of the channel subunits, with interaction free
energies of -55±7 kJ mol-1, -49±4 kJ mol-1 and -45±6 kJ mol-1 (Figure 3D). The latter of these values
corresponds to the site probed using PMF and FEP, revealing excellent agreement between the techniques.
For the fourth subunit, the secondary binding mode was recovered (-36±7 kJ mol-1), which again
corresponds well with value from the PMF analysis.
We note that in the WTMetaD simulations of Kir2.2, where the protein is necessarily xyz restrained (see
Supporting Methods), the channel is tilted (by ca. 5o) relative to the bilayer normal. We expect that this
small tilt relative to the bilayer induces the shift of PIP2 from the primary to the secondary binding site for
the fourth channel subunit, with the primary binding mode only accessible to three of the four binding sites
due to the orientation of the channel.

Corey et al.
CDL interactions with two transport proteins
The ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), also known as the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), is present in the
inner mitochondrial membrane where it accounts for 10% of the total protein content 54. It functions as a
regulator of mitochondrial adenine nucleotide concentration, allowing flux of ATP/ADP across the
mitochondrial membrane 55. CDL is known to bind to AAC 4,56 (Figure 4A), where it results in activation
of the transporter

57,58

. The protein has an approximate three-fold symmetry with three homologous, but

potentially non-identical, binding sites for CDL.
We probed the energetics of CDL-AAC interaction at all three of these sites with the protein embedded in
a POPC membrane using PMF and FEP calculations (Figure 4A). PMF analyses yielded free energies of 7±2, -8±4 and -5±2 kJ mol-1 for CDL binding at these sites (Figure 4B). FEP produces good agreement with
the PMF data, giving -9±3, -11±3 and -8±2 kJ mol-1 (Figure 4C), with each technique ranking the sites the
same in terms of CDL binding energies.
Next, we explored the system using WTMetaD, which revealed clear energy wells at all three binding sites
(Figure 4D). The interaction free energies for sites 1, 2 and 3 were -14±3 kJ mol-1, -13±3 kJ mol-1, and 11±6 kJ mol-1 respectively, showing reasonable agreement with the PMF and, to a greater degree, FEP
estimates. Reassuringly, the sites are again similarly ranked, with the site 3 lower in energy than sites 1 or
2.

Corey et al.
We also explored CDL interactions with the leucine transporter (LeuT), which is a bacterial homologue of
the solute carrier family 6 (SLC6) class of proteins, which includes the human serotonin transporter

59

.

LeuT catalyses sodium-driven small hydrophobic amino acid transport across the bacterial inner membrane
60

, and has been shown to bind to CDL (Figure 5A), which stabilizes the dimeric form of the transporter 50.

We probed the energetics of the CDL-LeuT interaction in a POPE membrane using both PMF and FEP
calculations. The initial CDL pose was based on a previously-identified likely binding site at the dimer
interface (see ref

50

for more details). PMF analysis yielded a value of -6±3 kJ mol-1 for CDL at this site

(Figure 5B), in agreement with the FEP value of -9±2 kJ mol-1 (Figure 5C). WTMetaD not only identifies
the dimer interface binding site (with a binding free energy of -7±3 kJ mol-1 and -10±6 kJ mol-1 for the
equivalent and opposing sites respectively), but also additional sites around the complex (Figure 5D). For
example, sites 2 and 4 appear to bind CDL with a lower energy than the dimer-interface site (-3±2 kJ mol1

for each site). Non-specific of CDL with a low free energy of ca. -3 kJ mol-1 is also seen over a 3 nm area

of each monomers (Figure 5D; dotted lines).
Cholesterol interactions with a GPCR
The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) class of proteins constitute the largest family of membrane proteins
and account for 35% of all drug targets 61. Many members are thought to be functionally modulated by
cholesterol binding

62

, including the highly studied adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) . This provides an

example of protein-lipid interactions with an uncharged and relatively rigid lipid molecule.
Cholesterol binding to A2AR has been previously identified structurally

63

and explored using molecular

dynamics 7,20,64. To probe the energetics of this process, we applied WTMetaD to human A2AR in a POPC
membrane to produce a full 2D map of cholesterol binding on the extracellular leaflet around the receptor.
We identified three binding sites between TM 1-2, 1-7 and 6-7 (Figure 6A-B), with binding free energies

of -8±3, -9±3 and -5±2 kJ mol-1. Of these only the TM 6-7 cholesterol binding site has been captured in
structural data for A2AR

35,65,66

, although the other two binding sites correspond to electron density

identified as acyl tails in several A2AR structures

35,65,66

.

We then probed these site using ABFE, using restraints and a thermodynamic cycle outlined in a recent
study by Salari et al 45 (see Supporting Methods and Supporting Figure 3). We obtained values of -5±2 kJ
mol-1, -8±1 kJ mol-1 and -2±1 kJ mol-1 for the three sites (Figure 6C), in reasonable agreement with the
WTMetaD data. Importantly, we get an identical ranking of the sites between the techniques, with site 2
the highest energy and site 3 the lowest. Note that we were unable to probe these sites using PMF
calculations, as the energies become swamped by background thermal fluctuations.

Corey et al.
We can compare our estimates of the strength of A2AR cholesterol interactions with those from other
simulation studies of GPCRs. Genheden et al 67 estimated free energies of interaction with b2AR and A2AR
of the order of -10 to -15 kJ mol-1 from CG simulations. Lee and Lyman 7 estimated free energies for the
A2aR of -3 to -5 kJ mol-1 from atomistic MD simulations. Thus, our estimates are in broad agreement with
those from previous studies of the A2AR, both of which estimated free energies directly from cholesterol
occupancies following extended (but possibly under sampled) equilibrium MD simulations.

Discussion
Integral membrane proteins are strongly affected by the lipid environment in which they reside (for a recent
review, see ref 1). Information on the structural basis of these interactions can be determined by X-ray
crystallography, cryoelectron microscopy, and NMR. In contrast, determining the free energies of these
interactions remains very challenging either experimentally 15,16,29, or computationally 5,11,18,20,21.
One of the main challenges facing computational estimation of free energies of protein-lipid interactions is
presented by the slow timescale of relaxation of lipid molecules in a bilayer. This means that for free energy
calculations, we need to be confident that we have adequately sampled those interactions, i.e. that the
simulations have converged. The agreement between all three techniques for lipid binding energetics gives
us confidence that this is indeed the case (Table 1 and Figure 7). To our surprise, the analyses here provide
lower energies for CDL binding to AAC

21

and other proteins

11,18,68

than previously reported; this

discrepancy most likely reflects a different handling of long range electrostatic interactions. Nonetheless,
when comparing like-for-like systems, as here, it is evident that all three techniques converge to a common
value and provide a similar degree of accuracy.
In addition to accuracy, it is of interest to compare the computational efficiency of the three methods,
especially if they are to be employed in an automated pipeline (see e.g. 31) to characterise and compare
protein-lipid interactions across a wide range of membrane protein structures. As can be seen from Table
2, the least computationally demanding technique is FEP/ABFE. This is because each alchemical pathway
can be adequately described in 21 (PIP2), 29 (cholesterol) or 31 (CDL) windows, and 250 ns of simulation
time per window is sufficient for good convergence (see Supporting Figures 2, 6 and 9). Running 5
independent repeats (resulting in ~25-40 µs simulation time in total) permits statistical analysis of the data.
In fact, the data suggest that this cost could be further reduced to 150 ns per window with only 3 repeats
(~9.5 µs in total; achievable in about 1 day with a mid to high range GPU), as this agrees well with the
more extensively sampled data (e.g. -48  2 kJ mol-1 vs -51  1 kJ mol-1; Supporting Figure 13A). Note that
these estimates do not account for the initial set of simulations that is required for the perturbation of each
lipid species in bulk membrane, as this benchmark may be used for subsequent calculations.

Corey et al.
PMFs are generally less cost-efficient than FEP, taking at least 50 µs to converge. This is largely because
equilibration of a lipid as it diffuses within a bilayer is relatively slow, meaning that each window needs to
be simulated for 1 µs (see Supporting Figures 1, 5 and 8). In addition, a 0.05 nm window spacing from the
bound state to bulk membrane usually requires 60 or more windows to get from the bound state to bulk. It
should be noted, however, that a less frequent spatial sampling of 0.1 nm intervals, whilst resulting in a
lower statistical certainty across the PMF, produces a similar estimation of Gbind (for instance -45±2 kJ
mol-1 vs -48±2 kJ mol-1; Supporting Figure 13B). In contrast to FEPs, however, PMFs offer a reaction
coordinate in 1D space, which may be useful in certain cases. An example of this is for Kir2.2, where the
PMF was able to detect the second, previously identified 53, binding site (Figure 3B).
Generally, WTMetaD is the most expensive technique, taking >100 µs to converge (see Supporting Figures
4, 7, 10 and 12), which is compounded by the requirement to read/write the Gaussian depositions to file,
together taking ~3x longer to sample the same timescales as a standard MD simulation. However, in
instances where a binding site is known, the simulations could be scaled back to focus upon the single
binding site, saving considerable resources in the process. In addition, WTMetaD allows the mapping of
the full 2D energy landscape around the target protein. This proved to be especially powerful for the A2AR
and LeuT systems, where multiple asymmetric binding sites were revealed. For the Kir2.2-PIP2 system, the
2D landscapes were additionally compared to the PMF data through extraction of 1D coordinates from the
data (see the Supporting Methods for details, and Supporting Figure 4F-G for data).
At present, we have compared these methods for estimation of lipid interaction free energies using the
Martini 22,23 force field. We are aware that the free energies estimated are therefore an approximation due
to smoothing of the free energy landscape, an inevitable consequence of coarse-graining. In the future,
comparison of these data with corresponding atomistic simulations will be necessary, although achieving
convergence of equivalent atomistic simulations is currently extremely challenging for systems of the size
and complexity described here.
Finally, comparison of these methods to experimental analyses will be of particular importance. Currently,
there have been only a few examples of experimentally-determined protein-lipid binding affinities: these
include using nMS 15, SPR 16 and FRET 29. The majority of these approaches, however, involve both the
protein and lipid being solubilised beforehand in detergent micelles. This will likely provide an inaccurate
picture of the true energetics of lipid binding/unbinding in a lipid membrane, as the acyl tails will likely
contribute substantially to the binding energies. Our work therefore highlights a pressing need for accurate
measurement of lipid binding affinities to be applied to a number of well characterised membrane protein
systems.

Corey et al.
In summary, we have shown that three distinct methods for coarse-grained free energy calculations are able
to provide robust estimates of the strength and specificity of lipid binding sites on membrane proteins. We
envisage that these simulations can be readily performed, taking protein-lipid binding sites identified from
structures, long equilibrium simulations (‘fingerprinting’)

99,69

or WTMetaD, and providing energies for

specific lipid association in a semi-automated manner. The characterisation of lipid binding sites on integral
membrane proteins offers the prospect of discovery of potential druggable allosteric sites on a wide range
of membrane proteins, including those within the current membrane protein structural proteome of ca.
4,000 structures 32.

Figure 1. Introduction to free energy calculations
A) Overview of free energy calculations. A membrane protein, as viewed from above the membrane, is
shown in cyan cartoon, and a lipid in yellow, orange and red spheres. Two states are modelled: the left state
is the protein bound to the target lipid, the right is the protein bound to a generic lipid (not shown), with the
target lipid unbound. Free energy calculations aim to compute the difference in free energy between these
states (Gbind).
B) Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations create a reaction coordinate in physical space by pulling the
lipid away from or towards the binding site. This coordinate can then be sampled, e.g. with umbrella
sampling, to provide a 1D energetic landscape, allowing calculation of Gbind between the target and a
generic lipid.
C) Chemical structures of PIP2, cardiolipin (CDL) and cholesterol.
D) Free energy perturbation (FEP) and absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations build alchemical
pathways which either change the bound lipid into a different species, in this study to that of the bulk
membrane, or fully remove the lipid from the simulation box. This provides the binding free energy
difference between the target lipid and a generic lipid, Gbind.
E) Well-tempered metadynamics (WTMetaD) biases the diffusion of a target lipid around the protein
through addition of a time-dependent Gaussian of energy to the collective variable (CV). These Gaussians
can then be reconstructed into a full 2D energy landscape, with comparison of binding regions and the bulk
membrane giving Gbind.

Figure 2. Thermodynamic cycle for FEP
Shown is a representative thermodynamic cycle used for the FEP calculations in this study. The protein
receptor (here Kir2.2) is shown as white surface, with the membrane as white sticks. The target lipid is
shown as coloured spheres: on the left the native PIP2 molecule has lipid tails in yellow, glycerol beads in
purple, phosphate beads in orange and sugar beads in cyan. On the right, the perturbed POPC lipid is
coloured as PIP2, but with a blue choline bead, and transparent beads for the beads which have now been
decoupled from the system. The horizontal vertices represent the two FEP calculations, where the target
lipid is alchemically perturbed into the bulk lipid either free in membrane (GPIP2-POPC(free)) or bound to the
receptor (GPIP2-POPC(bound)). These reactions are represented by a  coordinate from 0 to 1. Gbind can be
calculated as GPIP2-POPC(free) - GPIP2-POPC(bound), which will represent the same value as calculated in the
PMF calculations (Figure 1). Note that the right vertical vertex (GPOPC-bind) is the free energy required for
the bulk lipid binding the receptor – in this special case of protein-lipid binding, where the ligand and the
solvent are the same molecule, this value should be 0 kJ mol -1.

Figure 3. Calculating Kir2.2-PIP2 binding energetics
A) View of Kir2.2 in cyan cartoon, with a bound PIP2 molecule in yellow, orange and red spheres, as
sampled with CG MD. PIP2 interactions map to residues Arg 78, Arg 80, Lys 183, Arg 186, Lys 188, Lys
189 (Gallus gallus numbering). The approximate position of the membrane is shown with black lines. On
the left is a view from the side, and on the right is a cytoplasmic view of the transmembrane region alone,
with the intracellular domain removed for clarity. Note that only one PIP2 binding pose is shown, but four
are present around the homotetrameric Kir2.2.

B) PMF data for Kir2.2-PIP2 binding. The y-axis is set to 0 for the bulk membrane, and the difference
between this and the energy well (set to 0 nm on the x-axis) is Gbind, here -45±2, with errors from 200
rounds of bootstrap analysis.
C) FEP data for Kir2.2-PIP2 binding, showing the energy cost for perturbing PIP2 to POPC whilst bound
to Kir2.2 (red) and whilst free in a POPC membrane (blue). Gbind can be calculated from the free data
minus the bound (see Figure 2), giving a value of -48±2, with the error the standard deviation from five
repeats.
D) 2D energy landscape for Kir2.2 and PIP2 as computed using WTMetaD. The protein is shown as surface
behind the data, with the large intracellular domain removed for clarity. The energetic landscape for a PIP2
molecule around the protein has been computed and is shown as a red-blue contour map. Four binding
regions in red can be seen around the protein, with reported Gbind values as follow: S1=-55±7, S2i=49±4, S2ii=-45±5, S3=-45±6 and S4=-36±7 kJ mol-1.
