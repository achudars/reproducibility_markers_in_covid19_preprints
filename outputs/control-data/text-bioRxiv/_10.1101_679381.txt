ABSTRACT
ABL tyrosine kinase activity controls several aspects of development including axon patterning.
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is linked to Alzheimer’s disease and previous work established
that ABL is a downstream effector in an Appl, the Drosophila App ortholog, signaling pathway
which modulates axon outgrowth in the mushroom bodies (MBs), the fly memory center. Here
we

show

that Abl is

required

for

the

MB

neuron

axonal

growth.

Importantly,

both Abl overexpression and lack of expression produce a similar phenotype in the MBs indicating
the necessity of tightly regulating ABL activity. We find that the fly huntingtin protein (HTT), the
homolog of the protein involved in Huntington’s disease, behaves genetically as a repressor of
ABL activity. Supporting this, FRET-based measurements of in vivo ABL activity in the
MBs reveal a clear increase in its activity when HTT levels are reduced. Thus, in addition to its
many other reported roles, HTT acts as a negative regulator of ABL activity, at least in the MBs,
to maintain its appropriate physiological levels necessary for axon growth.

KEY WORDS: HTT, ABL, FRET, axonal growth, Appl signaling, mushroom body
INTRODUCTION
Tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration may be two sides of the same coin. Indeed, defining the
overlap of molecular pathways implicated in cancer and neurodegeneration may open the door to
novel therapeutic approaches for both groups of disorders (Staropoli, 2008). Interestingly, it has
been proposed that, in the non-pathologic physiological situation, the neurodegenerative Amyloid
precursor protein (APP) recruits the oncogenic Abelson (Abl) kinase in order to promote axonal
outgrowth (Soldano et al., 2013). Correlative studies have highlighted a decreased cancer
incidence in the neurodegenerative disorder Huntington’s disease (HD) population and both wildtype and mutant huntingtin (HTT) have been implicated in tumor progression (Thion and Humbert,
2018). It is, therefore, tempting to propose that different neurodegenerative diseases (ND) may
share components and mechanisms and that Abl may also have a role in ND.
The Abl-family of non-receptor tyrosine kinase includes human ABL1 and ABL2 as well
as the Drosophila Abl, all of which share a conserved domain structure along much of the protein.
Each ABL protein contains an SH3-SH2-TK (Src homology 3-Src homology 2-tyrosine kinase)
domain cassette which confers autoregulated kinase activity. Particularly, in these three proteins a
carboxy-terminal F (F-actin-binding) domain is identifiable which ties ABL-dependent
phosphoregulation to actin filament reorganization (Colicelli, 2010). ABL1 has been implicated to
function in a range of cellular processes including actin dynamics and cell migration. ABL was
discovered as a cellular proto-oncogene co-opted by the Abelson Murine Leukemia Virus, as well
as part of the Breakpoint Cluster Region (BCR)-ABL oncoprotein which is constitutively active
in human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (Wang,
2014). Alterations of ABL1 by chromosomal rearrangement or viral transduction can lead to
malignant transformation. Activity of the ABL1 protein is negatively regulated by its SH3 domain,
the deletion of which turns ABL1 into an oncogene (Barila and Superti-Furga, 1998).
Unphosphorylated and inactive murine Abl can be bound by an inhibitor, such as Pag/Msp23, that
contacts both the SH3 and the TK domains (Wen and Van Etten, 1997). After removal of the
inhibitor, Abl acquires substantial catalytic activity that is further enhanced by primary and
secondary (auto)phosphorylation (Brasher and Van Etten, 2000). The ABL kinases have also been

secondary (auto)phosphorylation (Brasher and Van Etten, 2000). The ABL kinases have also been
shown to play a crucial role in the development of the nervous system. Overexpression of active
Abl in adult mouse neurons results in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation and activation of
ABL has been shown to occur in human neurodegenerative disease (Schlatterer et al., 2011).
Drosophila Abl has a role in axonogenesis and growth cone motility and, of particular relevance
here, Abl has been implicated in axonal arborization and growth in the Drosophila brain (Leyssen
et al., 2005).
The adult central brain of Drosophila is largely composed of the central complex and the
mushroom bodies (MBs). MBs are bilateral and symmetrical structures that are required for
learning and memory (Heisenberg, 2003; Busto et al., 2010). Each MB is made of 2000 neurons
that arise from 4 neuroblasts whose larval development is known through use of specific markers.
Three types of neurons appear sequentially during development: the embryonic/early larval γ, the
larval α'β' and the late larval/pupal αβ. Each αβ neuron projects an axon that branches to send an
α branch dorsally, which contributes to the formation of the α lobe, and a β branch medially, which
contributes to the formation of the β lobe (Lee et al., 1999).
APPs have been intensely investigated because of their link to Alzheimer's disease and
neurodegeneration, although the normal in vivo function of APPs in the brain remains unclear and
controversial. Drosophila possesses a single APP homologue, called APPL, expressed in all
neurons throughout development. It has been shown that Appl is a conserved neuronal modulator
of a Wnt planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) pathway involved in MB axonal outgrowth (Soldano et
al., 2013). It has been proposed that APPL is part of the membrane complex formed by the core
PCP receptors. In turn, APPL recruits ABL kinase to the complex and positively modulates DSH
phosphorylation (Singh et al., 2010). DSH is an adaptor cytoplasmic protein apparently involved
in all known Wnt pathways and, as such, is also a core intracellular component of the Wnt/PCP
pathway. It was showed that a 50% reduction of Abl leads to a clear enhancement of the Appld
mutant phenotype. Conversely, wild-type Abl+ overexpression (UAS-Abl) but not UAS-Abl-KD
(the kinase dead version) within the αβ MB neurons led to a strong rescue of the Appld mutant
phenotype. Finally, these results, in addition to accompanying biochemical experiments, suggested
that APPL regulates the phosphorylation of DSH by ABL kinase and that this mechanism is
conserved in mammals (Soldano et al., 2013). Thus, ABL is the key downstream effector of APPL
required for MB axon outgrowth.

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a progressive autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative
disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract at the N-terminus of a large
cytoplasmic protein (3144 a.a.), huntingtin (HTT) (Saudou and Humbert, 2016). Several studies
indicate that an alteration of wild-type HTT function might also contribute to disease progression
(Cattaneo et al., 2005). The fly huntingtin protein (HTT, 3583 a.a.) is similar to the human HTT
protein, with four regions of high sequence homology clustered similarly all along the protein in
the N-, central- and C-terminal regions. Despite htt being highly conserved across all Drosophila
species, indicating an essential role for biological fitness, null htt mutants show no obvious
developmental defects (Zhang et al., 2009).
Although ABL is the key downstream effector of APPL required for MB axon outgrowth,
its precise role in MB development is poorly documented. Here we show, using analysis of Abl
loss-of function (LOF) alleles in single-cell MARCM clones that Abl is essentially required for
axonal growth in the developing αβ neurons of the MBs and that it is expressed in these neurons.
Importantly, the overexpression of Abl in these neurons leads to similar axonal growth defects to
those observed with the LOF allelic combinations, indicating the probable existence of cellular
proteins that negatively control neuronal ABL activity. We identify HTT as a potential cellular
inhibitor of ABL activity. These results indicate that Appl and htt, whose human homologs are
central players in neurodegeneration, regulate ABL activity in opposite directions to maintain it in
the narrow range necessary for normal axon outgrowth.
RESULTS
Loss-of-function and gain-of-function of Abl induce similar MB αβ neuron phenotype
Abl is a component of an APPL Wnt-PCP signaling pathway required for axon growth in MBs
(Soldano et al., 2013). Nevertheless, the precise role of Abl in MB neurons is poorly described.
We have used three Abl alleles (Abl1, Abl2 and Abl4) in order to characterize the requirement of
Abl function in MB development (Fig. S1A). Each of three double heterozygous combinations
(1/2, 2/4 and 1/4) are adult lethal but are viable at 48 hr after puparium formation (APF) enabling
their effects to be investigated at that stage when the αβ neurons are present and can be easily
visualized using the anti-Fasciclin II (FASII) antibody (Lee et al., 1999; Reynaud et al., 2015).
Interestingly, the three combinations gave similar MB phenotypes with a mixture of wild-type
(WT), absence of β lobe, absence of α lobe and absence of α and β lobes (Fig. 1A-D). Control MBs

showed less than 0.5% of absence of β lobe ( n=402 with 99.5% of the MBs being WT, data not
shown). These Abl mutant phenotypes, including lethality, were strongly rescued in the presence
of an Abl-GFP genomic construct (from 20%, n=115 to more than 80%, n=48 of WT MBs p < 105

; Fig. 1D). Abl is known to be deleterious when expressed in an unregulated fashion (Schlatterer

et al., 2011; Wang, 2014). We overexpressed Abl specifically in the MBs using the GAL4/UAS
system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993). WT Abl overexpression in the MBs under the control of the
OK107-GAL4 line, produced similar phenotypes to those obtained in Abl LOF alleles (Fig. 1E; Fig
S1B-E). The penetrance of the gain-of-function (GOF) mutant phenotype was even higher than
the one obtained with LOF alleles since WT MBs were never detected. Importantly, when a kinase
dead version of the Abl gene was expressed in the same conditions, no MB mutant phenotype was
apparent. This indicates that over-activity of the kinase function of ABL is causing the phenotype.
Taken together, these data strongly show that Abl expression must be tightly controlled in the MBs
in order to ensure normal MB axon development.
Abl function is required for MB axon outgrowth and is expressed in MB αβ neurons
The absence of MB lobes can result from either growth or guidance defects (Soldano et al., 2013;
Reynaud et al., 2015). In order to definitively establish which of these two cellular phenomena is
affected by loss of Abl we produced visualization MARCM clones. Ablmut two-cell/single cell
visualization MARCM clones showed growth defects (87% n = 15) as well as guidance defects
(20%) (Table 1 and Fig. 1F-I’). Therefore, we conclude that Abl, as Appl, is required for MB axon
outgrowth. To visualize the localization of ABL protein we employed a genomic Abl-GFP
construct, which rescues Abl mutant lethality and the mutant MB phenotypes (see above) and
therefore is likely a bona fide endogenous marker of ABL. Abl-GFP is expressed broadly and
homogenously in the brain with elevated levels in the MB αβ axons of 48 hours APF brains (Fig.
1J-J”). Taken together, these data show that Abl is expressed in the MBs and that Abl function is
required for MB axon outgrowth.
The lack of htt rescues MB axon outgrowth phenotypes
Since LOF and GOF of Abl produce similar MB phenotypes, its expression must be tightly
controlled during normal development. We were therefore interested in isolating potential cellular
inhibitors that negatively regulate Abl activity in the Drosophila MBs. Due to the recessive nature

of the Abl mutant phenotype and the autosomal location of the gene, we considered looking directly
for suppressors to be too laborious. We therefore took advantage of the previous observation that
ABL kinase acts downstream of APPL in MB axon growth (Soldano et al., 2013). Flies which are
null for Appl (Appld) are viable, fertile and show no gross structural defects in the brain (Luo et
al., 1992). The loss of one copy of Abl combined with Appld (in Appld w*/Y; Abl4/+ males)
increases the MB lobe loss phenotype compared to Appld alone, while overexpression of Abl in
MB neurons rescues the Appld phenotype (Soldano et al., 2013). We reasoned that a suppressor of
Abl activity could also be a suppressor of other components of the Wnt-PCP pathway required for
MB axon outgrowth, such as Appl and dsh for which hemizygous viable mutations are available
(Appld and dsh1).Therefore, the MB phenotype can be directly assayed in Appld males. Fly HTT is
a cytoplasmic ubiquitous protein expressed at low levels (Zhang et al., 2009). We identified htt as
a clear suppressor of the MB Appld mutant phenotype. The Appld MB phenotype was rescued by
reducing htt expression using three different genetic manipulations: 1) htt heterozygosity using
two mutant alleles of htt (htt-ko or httint), 2) heterozygosity for a 55 kb chromosomal deficiency
uncovering the htt locus and most of the adjacent CG9990, or 3) htt RNAi knock down in the αβ
MB neurons (Fig. 2A-E). We noted that loss of one or even two copies of htt did not result in any
significant MB developmental defects (Fig. S2A). However, we found that reducing one copy of
htt suppressed also the dsh1 MB phenotype (Fig. 2F-G and J). Hemizygosity for both Appl and dsh
(using a double mutant Appld w dsh1 chromosome) resulted in a strong MB axon outgrowth
phenotype (up to 60% absence of β lobe, n=129 compared to 21%, n=101 p < 10-5 in dsh1 and to
16%, n=141 p < 10-5 in Appld). We found that reducing htt was also a strong suppressor of the
Appld w dsh1 phenotype (12% of absence of β lobe, n=68 p < 10-5; Fig. 2 H-I and J). Taken
together, these data strongly suggest that HTT is a negative regulator of the Wnt-PCP signaling
pathway acting during MB axon outgrowth.
htt interacts with Abl mutant phenotype in MB axon outgrowth
We found that both the Appld and dsh1 MB phenotypes can be rescued by Abl expression (Fig. S2B
and C). Taken together with the finding that htt suppresses both Appl and dsh MB phenotypes, we
hypothesized that Abl might be the target of htt action. To test this hypothesis we conducted three
sets of experiments. First, the increased severity of the MB mutant phenotype in Appld; Abl2/+
individuals (31% of absence of β lobe, n=102) compared to Appld individuals (14% of absence of

β lobe, n=100 p=0.0041), was completely abolished when one copy of htt was also removed in
Appld; Abl2 httint/+ individuals (14% absence of β lobe, n=83 with p=0.0089 when compared to
Appld; Abl2/+ individuals and p=1 when compared to Appld individuals; Fig. 3A). Second, a modest
but significant increase in the proportion of WT MBs in Abl2/Abl1 individuals was observed when
one dose of htt was also removed (from 20%, n=222 to 32%, n=215 p=0.0086; Fig. 3B; Fig. S3
see discussion). Third, a clear increase of the Abl GOF mutant phenotype, measured by the absence
of both α and β lobes, was seen when one dose of htt was removed (from 21%, n=87 to 75%, n=79
p < 10-5; Fig. 3C upper and middle panel). Conversely, a clear rescue of this phenotype was
observed when htt was also overexpressed using UAS-htt-fl-CTAP, a UAS-C-terminally TAPtagged full length htt (from 21%, n=87 to 5%, n=77 p=0.005; Fig. 3C upper and lower panel).
Furthermore, the presence of wild-type MBs in these individuals is a strong indication of an
interaction between htt and Abl (from 0%, n=87 compared to 9%, n=77 p=0.0043; Fig. 3C last
panel). As expected from these results, expressing UAS-htt-fl-CTAP was able to abolish the
rescuing effect of httint/+ on Appld males (16% of absence of β lobe in Appld; UAS-htt-fl-CTAP/+;
httint/+ males , n=120 with p=0.0003 when compared to 2% of absence of β lobe in Appld; +/+;
httint/+ males, n=107 and p=0.8672 when compared to 17% of absence of β lobe in Appld males,
n=138) showing its functionality (Fig. 4A). Also, UAS-htt-fl-CTAP was properly expressed in the
MBs (Fig. 4B). The ability of htt/+ to suppress the Abl LOF phenotype or to enhance the Abl GOF
phenotype as well as the ability of htt overexpression to suppress the Abl GOF phenotype seem to
correlate with the amount of kinase-competent residual protein in the various mutant settings (see
discussion). Taken together, these data strongly further indicates that HTT is a repressor of ABL
function during MB axon outgrowth.
Reduction of htt increases ABL kinase activity in the developing MBs
One hypothesis to explain the suppressor effect of the lack of one dose of htt on the Abl MB mutant
phenotype is that HTT may have an inhibitory role on ABL kinase activity. A fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor probe that allows ABL kinase activity to be assayed
in living cells was recently introduced and validated in Drosophila (Kannan et al., 2017). Using
this tool, we first showed that the ABL kinase activity is detectable in the MBs by comparing the
FRET activity of the UAS-Abl-FRET versus the FRET activity of a mutant that lacks its
phosphorylatable tyrosine UAS-YàF Abl-FRET (Fig. 5A-C and E; Fig. S4). We then tested the

FRET efficiency in the developing MBs of control (+/+) versus httint/+ larvae and detected a clear
increase of the FRET efficiency when one dose of htt was removed (Fig. 5D and F). Quantitative
PCR analysis of control versus httint/+ third instar larval brains showed no difference in Abl
mRNA expression (Fig. 5G). Also, the htt/+ heterozygous background does not seem to result in
any apparent differences in either the quantity or the localization of ABL protein in the MBs (Fig.
6). Finally, reduced HTT expression does not affect the total levels of neuronal ABL in Drosophila
heads (Fig. S5). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that HTT is a repressor of ABL kinase
activity in the developing MB axons.
DISCUSSION
Abl is a key component of the Appl signaling pathway required for axonal arborization and growth
in the fly brain and the functional relationship between these two proteins is likely conserved in
mammals (Leyssen et al., 2005; Soldano et al., 2013). While the role of APP-mediated signaling
has been most clearly shown in Drosophila, a number of lines of evidence suggest that mammalian
APP also fulfills a signaling role (Beckett et al., 2012). Importantly, and in line with its protooncogenic role, Abl tyrosine kinase activity is tightly regulated by intramolecular inhibition (Barila
and Superti-Furga, 1998). Although Abl is clearly required as a downstream effector of Appl in the
MB axon growth, its precise role and regulation in the MBs has not been described.
We show here that Abl is required in axonal growth in the MBs, a brain structure that is
involved in memory. Furthermore, we show that both Abl overexpression and lack of expression
in the MBs produce similar phenotypes, indicating the need for tight regulation of ABL activity
during MB axon outgrowth. This raises the question of how ABL activity is normally negatively
regulated during MB axon outgrowth. We confirmed the previous observation that forced
expression of Abl rescues the Appld MB phenotypes (Soldano et al., 2013). Furthermore, we found
that Abl overexpression also rescues the dsh1 MB phenotype. These two results support the model
that APPL activates ABL, which in turn phosphorylates DSH (Fig. S2B and C). At the genetic
level, we expected an increase of ABL activity in an individual bearing LOF allele(s) of a putative
Abl repressor. We therefore hypothesized that reducing the levels of an Abl repressor would result
in suppression of the Appl and dsh mutant MB phenotype. We found that HTT is such a potential
inhibitor of ABL activity in the MBs. The loss of one dose of htt increased the activity of the wildtype ABL still present in Abl2/+ individuals and therefore prevented the enhancement of the MB

mutant phenotype (Fig. 3A). While a number of studies have concluded that HTT deficiency
results in significant alterations to kinase signaling pathways, to our knowledge this study is the
first to implicate the crucial phosphotyrosine kinase, ABL (Bowles and Jones, 2014).
The three Abl alleles used in this study are all have been shown to result in truncated
proteins (Smith and Liebl, 2005). While Abl1 retains the SH3, SH2 and TK domain of the ABL,
Abl2 is mutated within the TK domain and retains the SH3 and SH2 domains and Abl4, which is
mutated in the SH2 domain, retains the SH3 domain but completely lacks the TK domain (Fig.
S1A). It, therefore, seems likely that very little or no wild type Abl function remains in Abl2/Abl4
and Abl4/Abl1 individuals and can possibly explain why no rescue was observed when one dose of
htt was removed in these genetic backgrounds (Fig. S3). Conversely, since Abl1/Abl2 animals
express truncated ABL proteins, this allelic combination is likely less severe than the other two
genotypes. Indeed, while significant amounts of truncated Abl1 and Abl2 mutant proteins are
detectable, only faint protein bands are observed in Abl4 pupae (Bennett and Hoffmann, 1992).
Therefore, some significant kinase activity could remain in Abl2/Abl1 individuals and the loss of
one dose of htt might increase the activity of the remaining kinase activity (Fig. 3B). Finally,
removing one dose of htt in animals overexpressing ABL (Fig. 3C middle panel) would release
even more ABL activity, which in turn would exacerbate the mutant phenotype. In the opposite
way, over-expressing HTT, as in the double UAS-Abl, UAS-htt overexpressed individuals (Fig. 3C
lower panel), would inhibit ABL function when compared to the UAS-Abl overexpression alone
which thus might explain the observed rescue.
There are three different levels at which HTT might act to modulate Abl activity. First,
HTT could either directly or indirectly effect Abl mRNA levels. Although fly HTT has been
described as a cytoplasmic protein (Zhang et al., 2009), htt has been shown to be a suppressor of
position-effect variegation, suggesting a role in chromatin organization (Dietz et al., 2015). This
hypothesis is unlikely for the MB phenotype described here since qRT-PCR analysis of third instar
brains did not reveal a significant difference in Abl mRNA levels between httint/+ and control
individuals (Fig. 5G). Second, HTT could play a role in the quantity/stability or the localization of
the ABL protein in the MBs. We also consider this unlikely since the quantity of the endogenous
protein and the increased localization at the tip of the α lobes observed when UAS-Abl is driven by
c739-GAL4 are not different in httint/+ versus control individuals (Fig. 6). Third, HTT could have
an effect on the kinase activity of ABL itself. A FRET biosensor that allowed us to assay ABL

kinase activity directly in the MBs showed a clear increase in httint/+ versus control individuals
(Fig. 5). Therefore, we favor the model that HTT acts as an inhibitor of ABL kinase activity during
normal development.
The HEAT repeat domains of HTT may function as a solenoid-like structure that acts as a
scaffold and mediates inter- and intra-molecular interactions. Other arguments in favor of HTT
being a molecular scaffold are its large size and its stability (Saudou and Humbert, 2016). It is
tempting to propose that the scaffolding role of HTT in necessary for ABL kinase activity
repression. At least in the MBs, a balance between the activity of ABL, positively regulated by the
membrane complex formed by the core PCP proteins and APPL, and the repression of ABL
activity, which includes HTT might exist. On one hand, if APPL is absent, ABL is not optimally
activated leading to defects in MB axon growth. Conversely, when only 50% of HTT is present
this leads to de-repression of Abl kinase activity, which in turn compensates for its sub-optimal
level of activation in the absence of Appl. This unexpected apparent balance of activation and
inhibition of Abl by Appl and htt, whose orthologs are central players in human disease, may define
a conserved functional interaction to maintain ABL activity in the relatively narrow window to
appropriately effect axon outgrowth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drosophila Stocks
All crosses were maintained on standard culture medium at 25oC. Except where otherwise stated,
all alleles and transgenes have been described previously (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/). The
following alleles were used: Abl1, Abl2, Abl4, Appld, dsh1, httint (Dietz et al., 2015), htt-ko and Dfhtt (Zhang et al., 2009). The following transgenes were used: UAS-Abl (#28993), UAS-Abl.K417N
(from #8566) named here UAS-AblKD for kinase dead, UAS-RNAi-htt (Gunawardena et al., 2003),
UAS-RNAi-httv29351 and UAS-RNAi-httv29532 (VDRC), UAS-mCD8GFP, UAS-mito-GFP, UASFRT-y+-FRT and the genomic construct Abl-GFP (Fox and Peifer, 2007). UAS-htt-fl-CTAP was
produced for this study (see Constructs). We used three GAL4 lines: c739-GAL4 expressed in αβ
MB neurons, OK107-GAL4 expressed in all MB neurons (Aso et al., 2009) and the pan-neuronal
driver elavc155-GAL4. Recombinant chromosomes were obtained by standard genetic procedures
and were molecularly checked when required.

Adult and Pupal Brain Dissection and Immunostaining
Adult brains were dissected in PBS after fly heads and thoraxes had been fixed for 1hr in 3.7%
formaldehyde in PBS. They were then treated for immunostaining as previously described (Lee
and Luo, 1999; Boulanger et al., 2011). Pupal brains were dissected in PBS and fixed for 20min
in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at 4 oC with gentle rocking. After washing twice in PBS with 0.5%
Triton X-100 (PBT) for 15 min at room temperature, they hey were incubated in PBT and 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) (blocking solution) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by
overnight incubation at 4 oC with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution. Brains were then
washed three times in PBS for 20 min, followed by 30 min in the blocking solution, and then
addition of the secondary antibody with incubation for 3 hr at 4 oC. Brains were then washed three
times in PBS for 20 min and were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Antibody
combinations used: anti-Fasciclin II (mAb 1D4 from DSHB) at 1:50 dilution followed by antimouse Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:300; rabbit anti-MYC (Cell Signaling) at 1:1000
followed by anti-rabbit Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:300; mouse anti-TAP (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) at 1:300 followed by anti-mouse Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:300.
MARCM Clonal Analysis
To generate clones in the MB, we used the MARCM technique (Lee and Luo, 1999). For single
and two-cell clones, late L3 larvae were heat-shocked at 37oC for 15 min. Brains were dissected
at 48 hr APF and then stained. We use the term “visualization MARCM clones” since homozygous
mutant clones were examined in a homozygous mutant background.
Microscopy and Image Processing
Images were acquired at room temperature using a Zeiss LSM 780 laser scanning confocal
microscope (MRI Platform, Institute of Human Genetics, Montpellier, France) equipped with a
40x PLAN apochromatic 1,3 oil-immersion differential interference contrast objective lens. The
immersion oil used was Immersol 518F. The acquisition software used was Zen 2011. Contrast
and relative intensities of the green (GFP), red (Cy3) and blue (Cy5) channels were processed with
Fiji Software. Quantitation was performed using ImageJ software.

Constructs
pUAS-htt-fl-CTAP: A full length htt “mini-gene” bearing a dual C-terminal Tandem Affinity
Purification tag (Protein G and a streptavidin binding peptide: GS-TAP tag) was constructed. PCR
was performed using the dhtt “mini-gene” comprising the dhtt cDNA with intron 10 (as described
in Dietz et al., 2015) and the following primers:
HTT-TAP-FOR: ggtaccATGGACAAATCCAGGTCCAG (KpnI site added) and HTT-TAPREV: tctagaCAGGCACTGCAACATCCGG (XbaI site added). The resulting PCR product was
digested with KpnI/XbaI and sublconed into the pUAST-CTAP(SG) vector (Kyriakakis et al.,
2008). To avoid rearrangements due to dhtt instability, culturing conditions were used as
previously described (Dietz et al., 2015). pUAS-htt-fl-CTAP transgenic flies were generated and
balanced using standard procedures and expression of dhtt-SG was assessed using western blots.
FRET Imaging
Fly brains were dissected in 1X PBS at room temperature and collected in ice-cold PBS before
being fixed in 3.6% formaldehyde for 20 min. Brains were rinsed twice in PBST 0.5X for 20 min
before being mounted in Vectashield® (Vector Laboratories). MBs were imaged using a LSM780
confocal microscope (Zeiss) at x40 with oil immersion and on adjacent 0.5 µm confocal planes
along the anterior-posterior axis. Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) was excited at 405 nm and
emission recorded between 454 and 500 nm. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was excited at 514
nm and emission recorded between 516 and 571 nm. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) was generated at 405 nm. To avoid CFP emission, FRET was recorded out of CFP
emission range, between 587 and 624 nm.
FRET image analysis
Brains were oriented anterior-posteriorly using the peduncle as an anatomical landmark and
aligned according to the first confocal plane where a signal was visible. We ensured that the same
number of planes were obtained for each group (c739>Abl-FRET: 48 ± 4 planes and c739>(YàF)
Abl-FRET: 46 ± 1.5 planes, Student t-test: p=0,7. c739>Abl-FRET: 79,3 ± 2,3 planes and c739;
httint>Abl-FRET: 75,4 ± 3,7 planes; Student t-test: p=0,4) indicating that there were no differences

due to mounting. Average YFP and FRET signals were computed using the measurement of ‘Mean
Grey Value’ and the ‘Plot Z-axis Profile’ functions of ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012) into a region
of interest (ROI) corresponding to the contour of the MB and for each confocal plane. Background
was corrected using the ‘Rolling Ball Background Subtraction’ function (50 px radius). For each
plane and within the same ROI, FRET signal was expressed relative to YFP to account for
variability in Abl-FRET biosensor expression level or differences between preparations. Only
groups (i.e. Abl-FRET vs (YàF) Abl-FRET and Abl-FRET vs httint;Abl-FRET) crossed, collected,
dissected and imaged on the same day were compared. For any given confocal plane, FRET ratio
was averaged on left and right MBs and multiple animals.
qRT-PCR
To quantify Abl expression, RNA was extracted from the brains of L3 males. Brains (~20/sample)
were dissected in PBS 1X (Sigma) and kept on ice before homogenized in TRIzol® reagent
(Ambion). Total RNA was treated with DNAse to eliminate genomic DNA (TURBO DNasefreeTM, Applied Biosystems). RNA was purified using phenol-chloroform extraction and first
strand cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScriptTM III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).
Primers for Abl RNA amplification were designed on each side of intron 4-5 within exon 4 and 5
respectively. These exons are present in all Abl transcripts. Abl primers were designed using
Primer3Plus online software and using the qPCR settings (Untergasser et al., 2012). Abl forward
primer sequence is 5’-GCGGCCATCATGAAGGAAATG-3’ and reverse primer sequence is 5’TTGCCGTGCGACATAAACTC-3’. Abl RNAs were real-time quantified using incorporation of
SYBRGreen (Roche) and Light Cycler (Roche). Primers efficacy was first evaluated using a range
of cDNA concentrations to ensure linearity of the amplification (E=1,944). Only one melting
temperature (Tm=81,6°C) was obtained corresponding to a single PCR product (Abl amplicon).
The amplicon was run on a gel to ensure the size was the one expected for Abl after splicing (107
bp). A control without reverse transcription was done to ensure that Abl amplicon was not obtained
(Tm≠81.6°C). For each sample, a technical triplicate was performed and averaged. Independent
biological replicates were prepared for each condition and the fold change averaged (see
Statistics). The biological replicates correspond to independent dissections, extractions, reverse
transcriptions and quantifications. In the experimental condition (y w67c23/Y; ; httint/+), Abl

expression was expressed relative to control flies (y w67c23/Y) after normalization with internal
controls, Rpl9 and Rpl32, and using the ∆∆CT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).
Western blotting and immunoprecipitations
Lysates of adult Drosophila heads were prepared using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease
inhibitors (Sigma #11836170001). Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were: anti-GFP
(mouse, HTZ 19C8 and 19F7, Memorial-Sloan Kettering Monoclonal Antibody Facility; (Heiman
et al., 2014)), anti-dAbl (rabbit, 1:500; (Song et al., 2010)). Antibodies used for immunoblotting
with dilutions were: anti-dhtt (3526, rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000; (Dietz et al., 2015)), anti-dAbl (as
above, 1:1,000), anti-GFP (rabbit, Invitrogen #A-11122, 1:1,000), anti-b-Tubulin (mouse, DSHB
E7, 1:10,000), anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IRDye secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences,
1:10,000). Immunoprecipitations were performed in RIPA buffer incubated with 1µg of anti-GFP
or 2µg of anti-dAbl. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with either Protein A and Protein G
Sepharose beads (anti-GFP), or Protein A Sepharose beads (anti-dAbl) for 1h at 4°C before
washing three times with RIPA buffer. Protein A and Protein G Sepharose beads were from
Amersham Biosciences. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved on NuPAGE 3-8%
gradient Tris-Acetate gels with Tris-Acetate running buffer. After transfer to nitrocellulose
membranes, blots were processed according to the Odyssey CLx protocol.
Statistics
Comparison between two groups expressing a qualitative variable was analyzed for statistical
significance using the Fisher exact test (https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/fisher/Default2.
aspx). Comparison of two groups expressing a quantitative variable was analyzed using the twotailed Mann-Whitney U test (https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/mannwhitney/Default2.aspx).
For FRET quantitation, statistical analyses were done using Prism 8.0 (GrapPad). For each
confocal plane of each group, normality of FRET ratio was assessed using D'Agostino & Pearson
normality test. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare groups at each confocal
plane. For the RT-qPCR, the averaged fold change of Abl expression was compared to the
theoretical value of 1 that would correspond to no change in Abl expression and non-parametric
Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-Normally distributed data or small samples was used. Values
of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant.

Fig. 3. htt interacts with Abl mutant phenotype. (A) The Appld mutant phenotype is enhanced
in an Abl2 heterozygote mutant background. However, the Appld mutant phenotype is not modified
in an Abl2 httint double heterozygote mutant background. Note that these two experiments were
done independently, but for both of them the Appld mutant phenotype was 14% of β lobe absence.
(B) The Abl2/Abl1 mutant phenotype is partially rescued by the loss of one copy of htt as inferred
by the increase of the wild-type (WT) MBs. (C) The absence of α and β lobe phenotype observed
in UAS-Abl driven by OK107-GAL4 is strongly increased by the loss of one copy of htt. However,
this phenotype is rescued by the overexpression of full-length htt. The presence of WT MBs in this

Fig. 5. Reducing htt expression increases Abl-FRET biosensor phosphorylation state during
MB development. (A) Schematic representation of an imaged MB in the brain. (B) The Abl-FRET
biosensor is based on mammalian CRK protein scaffold with two additional fluorescent proteins
(CFP and YFP). ABL kinase activity induces phosphorylation of UAS-Abl-FRET biosensor
leading to its spatial rearrangement and increased FRET efficiency (Ting et al., 2001).
Representative maximal projection of the YFP and FRET signals recorded in the MB lobes of
adult flies using confocal microscopy. Scale bar: 10µm. (C) FRET and YFP signals are recorded
on adjacent 0.5 µm confocal planes along all the anterior-posterior axis of the α and β MB lobes
in adult flies. Either wild-type UAS-Abl-FRET biosensor or a mutated form (UAS-YàF AblFRET) are expressed in the αβ MB neurons using the c739-GAL4 driver. In the UAS-YàF AblFRET biosensor, the tyrosine (Y) located in ABL target site (PYAQP) was replaced by a
phenylalanine (F) impairing phosphorylation (Kannan et al., 2017). FRET efficiency is
significantly reduced for UAS-YàF Abl-FRET relative to UAS-Abl-FRET biosensor for all
confocal planes considered except for the nine most anterior and six most posterior planes. Twotailed Mann-Whitney tests on non-Normally distributed data. Results are mean ± SEM with n ≥ 7
MB for each confocal plane. (D) Reducing htt expression increases FRET efficiency of UAS-AblFRET biosensor in third instar larval MB lobes. The UAS-Abl-FRET biosensor is expressed in MB
neurons using the c739-GAL4 driver in control (+/+) and httint/+ flies. FRET efficiency is
significantly increased in httint/+ flies for all confocal planes along the anterior-posterior axis
except for the three located 3 to 4 µm from the initial confocal plane. Two-tailed Mann-Whitney
tests on non-Normally distributed data. Results are mean ± SEM with n ≥ 13 MB for each confocal
plane. (E) FRET efficiency is globally reduced in UAS-YàF Abl-FRET mutant versus UAS-AblFRET. FRET efficiency is averaged for all confocal planes and all along the anterior-posterior

Fig. S1, related to Fig. 1. Structure and overexpression of the ABL protein.
(A) Molecular scheme of the ABL protein. ABL protein is composed of conserved domains: Src
Homology 3 (SH3) domain (blue), Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain (orange), Kinase Domain (red),
Poly-Proline PP domain (purple) and F-Actin Binding Domain (FABD) (green). The protein
produced by Abl1 mutant allele is truncated between PP and Kinase domains. The protein produced
by Abl2 mutant allele is truncated within the Kinase domain. The protein produced by Abl4 mutant
allele is truncated within the SH2 domain (Smith and Liebl, 2005). (B-E) Anti-FASII staining

intensity projection of vertical and medial MB lobes in stage 3 larvae. The Abl-FRET biosensor is
expressed in the MBs using c739-GAL4 and imaged. Maximum intensity projection of confocal
stacks corresponding to YFP and FRET signal are shown. Scale bar: 10µm.
Fig. S5, related to Fig.6. Reduced HTT expression does not affect the total levels of neuronal
ABL in Drosophila. ABL protein levels are unaffected in either htt mutants or with htt RNAi
knockdown. (A) Whole cell extracts were made from adult heads from the following
genotypes: +/+, httint/httint and httint/+. Lysates from adult heads were either subjected to western
blotting to assess HTT, β-tubulin and ABL levels, or immunoprecipitated using anti-ABL and
subjected to western blotting to examine ABL levels. A low molecular weight nonspecific (N.S.)
precipitated protein is shown for the IPs. (B) Quantification of ABL protein levels in the indicated
genotypes was made from western blots relative to β-tubulin (for cell lysates) or the N.S. band (for
anti-ABL IPs) and plotted as fold change in expression relative to the +/+ control. (C) HTT was
knocked down using two RNAi lines (UAS-htt RNAiv29532 and UAS-htt RNAiv29531) driven by
elav c155-Gal4 in flies expressing GFP-ABL. Lysates from adult heads were either subjected to
western blotting to assess HTT, β-tubulin and GFP-ABL (using anti-GFP) levels, or
immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP and subjected to western blotting to examine GFP-ABL
levels. (D) Quantification of GFP-ABL was assessed relative to β -tubulin (for cell lysates) or
N.S.(for anti-ABL IPs) and plotted as fold change in expression relative to the Abl-GFP control.
