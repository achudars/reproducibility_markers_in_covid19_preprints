Abstract

33

Nuclear envelope herniations (blebs) containing FG-nucleoporins and ubiquitin are the

34

phenotypic hallmark of Torsin ATPase manipulation. Both the dynamics of blebbing and the

35

connection to nuclear pore biogenesis remain poorly understood. We employ a proteomics-based

36

approach to identify MLF2 as a luminal component of the bleb. Using an MLF2-based live cell

37

imaging platform, we demonstrate that NE blebbing occurs rapidly and synchronously

38

immediately after nuclear envelope reformation during mitosis. Bleb formation is independent of

39

ubiquitin conjugation within the bleb, but strictly dependent on POM121, a transmembrane

40

nucleoporin essential for interphase nuclear pore biogenesis. Nup358, a late marker for

41

interphase nuclear pore complex (NPC) biogenesis, is underrepresented relative to FG

42

nucleoporins in nuclear envelopes of Torsin-deficient cells. The kinetics of bleb formation, its

43

dependence on POM121, and a reduction of mature NPCs in Torsin deficient cells lead us to

44

conclude that the hallmark phenotype of Torsin manipulation represents the accumulation of

45

stalled NPC assembly intermediates.

Introduction

64

Torsin ATPases (Torsins) are widely conserved proteins in metazoans and have essential, yet

65

poorly understood roles. While Torsins are phylogenetically related to the well-characterized

66

Clp/HSP100 proteins (Rose et al., 2015), they deviate from these ATPases in several

67

fundamental aspects. Torsins are the sole members of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily to reside

68

in both the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the nuclear envelope (NE)

69

(Laudermilch et al., 2016). Another unusual feature is that Torsins are inactive in isolation and

70

require one of two membrane-spanning cofactors, LAP1 or LULL1, for ATPase activity (Zhao et

71

al., 2013). This activation relies on a classical active site complementation mechanism, in which

72

the luminal domain of LAP1 or LULL1 contribute an arginine finger that is notably absent from

73

Torsin ATPases (Brown et al., 2014; Sosa et al., 2014). Apart from activating Torsins, these

74

cofactors also modulate the oligomeric state of the Torsin assembly (Chase et al., 2017b). A

75

steadily increasing number of mutations affecting this delicate assembly have been identified as

76

causal factors in human pathologies. Some of these mutations destabilize essential intersubunit

77

interactions at the Torsin-cofactor interface. Notably, this is the case for the highly debilitating

78

movement disorder DYT1 dystonia (Brown et al., 2014; Demircioglu et al., 2016) where

79

TorsinA was originally identified through a positional cloning approach (Ozelius et al., 1997).

80

More recently, a LAP1 mutation was identified that severely limits the lifespan of affected

81

individuals who suffer from diverse symptoms including dystonia and myopathy (Fichtman et

82

al., 2019).

83

While the diverse set of Torsins exhibit tissue-specific expression (Jungwirth et al., 2010)

84

and differential abilities to be stimulated by their distinctively localizing cofactors (Zhao et al.,

85

2013), the shared hallmark phenotype that is observed upon their genetic manipulation from

86

nematodes (VanGompel et al., 2015) to Drosophila melanogaster (Jokhi et al., 2013), mouse

87

models (Goodchild et al., 2005; Liang et al., 2014; Tanabe et al., 2016), and tissue culture cells

88

(Laudermilch et al., 2016; Naismith et al., 2004; Rose et al., 2014) is NE blebbing (Laudermilch

89

and Schlieker, 2016). Major obstacles towards understanding Torsin function in this phenotypic

90

context are the genetic redundancy between Torsin homologs in human tissue culture cells and

91

mouse models (Kim et al., 2010; Laudermilch et al., 2016) and the essential nature of Torsins

92

(Goodchild et al., 2005).

93

We previously presented a system that resolves both of these limitations by generating a

94

quadruple Torsin deletion HeLa cell line (designated 4TorKO) in which all four Torsin genes

95

(TorsinA, TorsinB, Torsin 2A and Torsin3A) have been deleted using CRISPR/Cas9 genome

96

engineering. This 4TorKO cell line abundantly exhibits the hallmark cellular phenotype of NE

97

blebbing in which the inner nuclear membrane (INM) bulges into the perinuclear space (PNS) to

98

form an omega-shaped herniation. Ubiquitin (Ub) conjugates of the K48 linkage type are

99

enriched in the lumen of the bleb in 4TorKO cells and in mouse models of Torsin dysfunction

100

(Pappas et al., 2018). At the base of a bleb there is electron density with a uniform diameter and

101

dimensions similar to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). This density can be decorated via

102

immunogold labeling using Mab414 antibodies, which recognize several FG-rich NPC

103

components termed FG nucleoporins (FG-Nups) (Laudermilch et al., 2016).

104

Whether a causal relationship exists between these NPC markers and bleb formation is

105

largely unknown. However, the finding that nuclear transport is perturbed in Caenorhabditis

106

elegans upon mutation of the TorsinA homolog OOC-5 (VanGompel et al., 2015) as well as the

107

observation of altered in situ distribution of nuclear transport machinery in brain tissue of mouse

108

models of dystonia (Pappas et al., 2018) further support a functional connection between Torsins

109

and the NPC. Clearly, more insight into the molecular composition of these Nup-containing

110

densities and their provenance is required to distinguish whether they are mature NPCs, products

111

of stalled NPC biogenesis, or a result of NPC instability. One hurdle in testing kinetically

112

resolved roles for Torsins in NPC biogenesis or homeostasis is the absence of bleb-specific live

113

cell imaging markers. A better functional assignment for Torsins is additionally confounded by a

114

lack of quantitative information about NPC number and assembly state in relation to bleb

115

formation.

116

In this study, we quantify NPCs and observe a considerable reduction of mature NPCs

117

with a concomitant increase of Nup-containing blebs in 4TorKO cells relative to wild type (WT)

118

cells. These structures form in a strictly cell cycle-dependent fashion. We find that the protein

119

Myeloid Leukemia Factor 2 (MLF2) is highly enriched in the lumen of newly forming blebs,

120

allowing us to develop MLF2 derivatives as bleb-specific probes with broad utility for live cell

121

imaging and functional characterization. Notably, bleb formation occurs rapidly and

122

synchronously immediately following NE reformation after mitosis, a timing that is reminiscent

123

of interphase NPC biogenesis. This dynamic buildup can be selectively perturbed by depletion of

124

POM121, a Nup that is essential for interphase NPC biogenesis. These observations, as well as

125

the diagnostic underrepresentation of the late NPC biogenesis marker Nup358 from Nup-

126

containing blebs, establish a role for Torsins during interphase NPC biogenesis.

Results

129

Torsin-deficient cells exhibit reduced numbers of mature nuclear pores

130

To further explore a functional relationship between Torsin and NPCs, we first asked

131

whether Torsin deletion leads to a reduction in the number of nuclear pores in asynchronously

132

growing cells. To this end, we exploited our previously reported HeLa-based 4TorKO cell line

133

and processed cells for standard transmission electron microscopy (EM) along with isogenic WT

134

cells. As expected, WT cells featured an evenly spaced INM and ONM, with an average of 15.2

135

nuclear pores per 30 µM of NE (Fig. 1A, lower panel and Fig. 1B). As reported previously

136

(Laudermilch et al., 2016), the blebbing phenotype was highly penetrant in 4TorKO cells (Fig.

137

1A, upper panel). The number of mature nuclear pores was significantly decreased relative to

138

WT cells with an average of 11.2 nuclear pores per 30 µm of NE (Fig. 1B). This was

139

accompanied by a corresponding increase of fuzzy electron density at the base of many blebs

140

(Fig. 1B) that we have shown to represent FG-Nup containing assemblies (Laudermilch et al.,

141

2016). Thus, the observed reduction of the number of nuclear pores with a concomitant increase

142

of FG-Nup assemblies at the bases of blebs represents a highly robust phenotype.

143
144

Nuclear envelope herniations form in interphase

145

A second important criterion supporting a connection to NPC assembly would be a

146

possible cell cycle dependency of bleb formation. The latter assertion is based on prior work that

147

cumulatively suggests that there are likely two biochemically (Doucet et al., 2010) and

148

morphologically distinct mechanisms of NPC assembly, one occurring during post-mitotic NE

149

reformation and the other during interphase (Otsuka and Ellenberg, 2018)(Fig. S1). In the latter

150

case, there is an emerging consensus that NPC assembly begins from the inside of the nucleus on

151

the INM (Doucet et al., 2010) likely through an inside-out evagination of the INM, which

152

ultimately leads to fusion with the ONM (Otsuka et al., 2016). Interphase assembly might be

153

under the control of cell cycle (Talamas and Hetzer, 2011) and other (McCloskey et al., 2018)

154

regulators with a potential burst of this assembly mechanism in early G1 (Doucet et al., 2010;

155

Otsuka et al., 2016; Weberruss and Antonin, 2016). If the Torsin knockout phenotype does

156

indeed represent a stalling in NPC biogenesis, we would expect to observe the first signs of bleb

157

formation early in G1. To investigate this possibility, we synchronized 4TorKO cells in early S-

158

phase using the double thymidine block method (Bostock et al., 1971) and processed the cells for

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/821835; this version posted October 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

159

immunofluorescence at various times after release from the thymidine block (Fig. 1C, D). Anti-

160

K48-Ub antibodies were used to score for bleb formation since K48-linked Ub is strongly

161

enriched in the bleb lumen both in 4TorKO cells (Laudermilch et al., 2016) and in mouse models

162

of DYT1 dystonia (Pappas et al., 2018). While the majority of asynchronously growing 4TorKO

163

cells exhibited K48-Ub foci diagnostic of NE blebs (Fig. 1E), a striking cell cycle dependency

164

was observed in synchronized cells. At the G1/S boundary (T = 0 h upon release of block),

165

nearly all cells contain K48-Ub foci (Fig. 1D, E). Additionally, we observed essentially the same

166

abundance for subsequent time points during S phase and early G2. Following mitosis, however,

167

this number drops substantially (Fig. 1D, E). It should be noted that in our experience, the entire

168

HeLa cell population is not sharply synchronized under conditions of the double thymidine

169

synchronization. Some deviation from complete synchrony certainly exists (we estimate that

170

about 85% of the population is well-synchronized). However, midbodies (that are also labeled

171

with anti-K48-Ub, see middle panel in Fig. 1D) can be used as convenient diagnostic markers to

172

assign cells to the time of late cytokinesis. Notably, K48-Ub NE foci are completely absent from

173

the nascent NE of these dividing or recently divided cells. As cells proceed through G1, the

174

number of K48-Ub foci steadily increases again and reaches a maximum at approximately 20 h

175

post-release from the thymidine block (Fig. 1E), which is about one complete cell cycle. To

176

directly confirm that the reduction of K48-Ub NE foci coincides with a loss of blebs, we also

177

performed an analogous double thymidine block experiment and processed synchronized

178

4TorKO cells for EM at T = 2 h and T = 12 h post-release. These correspond to the time points

179

of highest and lowest abundance of K48 foci, respectively. We observed that the number of blebs

180

per cross section for each time point is in good agreement with the numbers derived from

181

immunofluorescence (cf. Fig. 1E and F). We therefore conclude that the formation of blebs is a

182

cell cycle-dependent process and that the majority of blebs are formed during G1.

183
184

MLF2 is highly enriched in nuclear envelopes of 4TorKO cells

185

While the observed timing of bleb formation is consistent with a possible role for Torsins

186

in NPC biogenesis (D'Angelo et al., 2006; Dultz and Ellenberg, 2010; Otsuka et al., 2016), a live

187

cell imaging readout for bleb formation would enable higher temporal resolution. Moreover, live

188

cell observations on a single cell level allow for a direct visualization of mitotic events and

189

should resolve the issue of incomplete synchronization that limited the accuracy of our former

190

measurements (cf. Fig. 1).

191

We therefore set out to identify a suitable marker that is specific to NE blebs. To this end,

192

we utilized a comparative proteomics approach in which we compared the respective NE

193

proteomes of 4TorKO verse WT cells. Briefly, we gently homogenized 4TorKO and WT cells

194

and isolated NEs by a series of consecutive centrifugation steps (see Materials and Methods)(Fig.

195

2A). Since at least a subset of bleb luminal components appear to be conjugated to K48-Ub

196

(Laudermilch et al., 2016), we solubilized NEs with mild detergent and immunoprecipitated the

197

obtained extracts with K48-Ub-specific antibodies. Note that both the bleb structure and their

198

reactivity to K48-Ub antibodies are preserved under these gentle NE isolation procedures (Fig

199

2A, inset) prior to addition of detergent. The resulting immunoprecipitates (IPs) were then

200

resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS).

201

One protein that stood out immediately was Myeloid Leukemia Factor 2 (MLF2) as it

202

was identified with 36% sequence coverage in the 4TorKO sample compared to only 12% in the

203

WT control sample (Table S1, Fig. 2B, identified peptides are highlighted in red). To confirm

204

this enrichment, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering and installed a C-terminal

205

tandem HA tag on MLF2 at the endogenous locus in both WT and 4TorKO genetic backgrounds.

206

Clonal cell lines were isolated from WT and 4TorKO backgrounds with equivalent MLF2-HA

207

expression levels (cf. whole cell lysates, WCL, Fig. 2C). Using these cell lines, we conducted

208

subcellular fractionations to analyze the relative amount of MLF2 in nuclear, NE, and

209

nucleoplasmic fractions. After fractionation, the corresponding samples were solubilized in SDS

210

and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. While MLF2-HA levels were approximately

211

the same in whole cell lysates, we observed slightly more MLF2 in the nuclear fraction of

212

4TorKO cells (Fig. 2C). A further deconvolution of nuclei into NEs and nucleoplasm revealed a

213

major enrichment of MLF2 in the NEs of 4TorKO cells relative to WT cells, while the levels

214

were comparable in the nucleoplasmic fraction (Fig. 2C). The INM protein Sun2 was

215

additionally monitored via immunoblotting to confirm successful fractionation (Tsai et al.,

216

2019). Finally, we subjected detergent extracts of both NE fractions to immunoprecipitation with

217

anti-K48-Ub antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. In line with our original

218

MS-based experiment, we detected MLF2 in the IPs from 4TorKO NEs but not from WT NEs

219

(Fig. 2D). These results led us to explore the potential use of MLF2 as a live cell imaging tool to

220

investigate the potential role of Torsin ATPases in NPC biogenesis.

221
222

Establishing MLF2 as a bleb-specific marker

223

To begin, we engineered an MLF2-GFP fusion protein, and asked whether MLF2

224

localizes to blebs. 4TorKO cells were transfected with MLF2-GFP and we then monitored the

225

localization of the fusion protein relative to blebs (direct fluorescence versus anti-K48-Ub signal)

226

by immunofluorescence. We observed a punctate pattern for MLF2-GFP at the nuclear periphery

227

combined with a diffuse nucleoplasmic staining (Fig. 3A). These observations are in excellent

228

agreement with our biochemical fractionation (Fig. 2C). More importantly, we observed a

229

correlation in 4TorKO cells displaying both K48-Ub and MLF2 foci (Fig. S2A-C), and a

230

considerable, though not complete, degree of colocalization between K48-Ub staining and

231

MLF2-GFP, which is also apparent in a line scan analysis (Fig. S3A).

232

The question arises whether the observed MLF2-GFP localization is indeed a specific

233

indicator of NE bleb formation or if the perinuclear foci formation merely results from perturbed

234

nuclear export. We therefore asked if GFP variants with a nuclear export signal (NES-GFP) or

235

nuclear import signal (NLS-GFP) give rise to a similar or distinct localization pattern. Both

236

NES-GFP and NLS-GFP variants showed the expected extranuclear and nucleoplasmic

237

localization, respectively (Fig. 3B, upper panel, and Fig. 3C). To validate the functionality of

238

NES-GFP and explore the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport competency of 4TorKO cells, we treated

239

cells with Leptomycin B (LMB), a CRM1-dependant nuclear export inhibitor (Kudo et al.,

240

1998). As expected, we observed a strong nucleoplasmic GFP signal upon inhibition of nucleo-

241

cytoplasmic trafficking (Fig. 3B, lower panel), excluding the formal possibility that NES-GFP

242

never enters the nucleus. Additionally, we did not observe an enrichment of HA-tagged Ran

243

(Fig. 3D), a major player in nuclear transport (Adam et al., 1992; Lui and Huang, 2009). Thus,

244

MLF2 is a highly specific marker for NE aberrations in 4TorKO cells.

245

We next asked whether MLF2-GFP distinctively localizes to NE blebs, a question that is

246

best addressed via EM, which also provides information about membrane topology. We

247

processed MLF2-GFP-expressing 4TorKO cells for EM via high pressure freezing and subjected

248

sections to immunogold labeling with anti-GFP antibodies. 4TorKO cells displayed the typical

249

accumulation of NE blebs (Laudermilch et al., 2016). We observed a striking enrichment of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/821835; this version posted October 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

250

immunogold labeling of MLF2-GFP in these blebs and can clearly assign this accumulation to

251

the bleb lumen that is enclosed by the INM (Fig. 4A). At a low frequency, we additionally

252

observe cases in which gold particles concentrate in direct juxtaposition of a deformed INM (Fig.

253

4B, C). These could represent early bleb intermediates in which evaginations of the INM begin

254

to form. The early addition of MLF2 to bleb intermediates would imply that MLF2 might be

255

added before K48-Ub conjugation occurs. Supporting this idea, we observe more 4TorKO cells

256

with MLF2 foci earlier than K48-Ub in G1 phase (Fig. 4D). We therefore conclude that MLF2

257

has the potential to be an effective tool in elucidating the dynamics of bleb formation.

258
259

Live cell imaging with MLF2-GFP reveals rapid and synchronous formation of nuclear envelope

260

blebs

261

Resolving the dynamics of bleb formation relative to NE reformation during mitosis

262

requires a non-invasive, robust live cell imaging platform. To this end, we generated a 4TorKO

263

cell line stably expressing MLF2-GFP and mScarlet-Sec61β through retroviral transduction. To

264

mitigate the potential occurrence of any artificial morphological effects on cells resulting from

265

the constitutive activation of either gene, we employed a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible promoter

266

system to control the expression levels of both genes. Furthermore, we utilized lattice light sheet

267

microscopy (LLSM) as it provides rapid three-dimensional image acquisition with reduced

268

photobleaching thus allowing the acquisition of longer time series data. Since we crudely

269

assigned

270

prometaphase/metaphase mitotic cells based on their round appearance and visible metaphase

271

plates (Fig. 5A) and followed MLF2-GFP and mScarlet-Sec61β into early G1 (Supplemental

272

Video 1). For standardization, the onset of anaphase was arbitrarily defined as T = 0 s. In

273

agreement with previous observations, NE reformation after open mitosis occurred between 400-

274

500 s after anaphase onset (Fig. 5A) (Dechat et al., 2004). At about 700 s, the first small MLF2-

275

GFP foci appear in the nuclear periphery, while larger ones are observed at later times (Fig. 5A).

276

Additionally, a small number of foci appear to form at some distance to the nuclear periphery in

277

the nucleoplasm (Fig. 5A and Supplemental Video 1). Since we observed this trend repeatedly,

278

we scrutinized this process further in an independent experiment to obtain a deconvoluted image

279

series. We observed that the vast majority of these seemingly nucleoplasmic “outliers” are in fact

280

closely associated with evaginations or wrinkles of the NE as judged by their colocalization with

281

mScarlet-Sec61β (Fig. 5B, Supplemental Video 2).

282

Since LLSM is superior to conventional fluorescence microscopy in terms of

283

photobleaching, we were able to closely resolve the growth of individual foci over time.

284

Focusing on the formation and maturation of a subset of MLF2-GFP foci in an individual

285

daughter cell, we observed an initial steep growth phase that reached a maximum fluorescence

286

intensity around 1200 s after anaphase onset (Fig. 5C-E). After this rapid growth phase, the foci

287

appear to be static (Fig. 5D). Thus, the formation of the blebs is far more rapid than previously

288

inferred from utilizing K48-Ub as a readout in fixed cells (cf. Fig. 1E). Another unexpected

289

observation is the synchrony with which the bleb formation occurs (Fig. 5A, D, E, and

290

Supplemental Video 1). Based on our time-resolved recordings, we estimate that the vast

291

majority of initiation events can be narrowed down to a ~100 s time window starting at ~700 s

292

after anaphase onset, which is in agreement with the appearance of NPC intermediates and

293

subsequent formation of nascent NPCs from previous reports utilizing diverse microscopic

294

methodologies (D'Angelo et al., 2006; Otsuka et al., 2016; Otsuka et al., 2018a).

295
296

Ubiquitin conjugation is dispensable for bleb formation

297

Ubiquitin was the first-characterized marker to label NE blebs in a TorsinA-deficient

298

mouse model (Liang et al., 2014). However, it has been unclear if a functional relationship

299

between ubiquitylation and bleb formation exists. To test for a possible requirement, we asked

300

whether we could engineer MLF2 to recruit Ub-modifying enzymatic activities to the bleb

301

lumen. To this end, we engineered a construct consisting of a N-terminal MLF2 moiety fused to

302

a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) domain derived from M48, the largest tegument protein of

303

murine cytomegalovirus (Schlieker et al., 2005), followed by a C-terminal FLAG tag to create

304

MLF2-M48WT (Fig. 6A, B). This DUB domain potently deconjugates K48-linked Ub chains

305

(Schlieker et al., 2007), the linkage type that is present in blebs (Laudermilch et al., 2016; Pappas

306

et al., 2018) (Fig. 1D). As a control, we engineered a catalytically inactive variant in which the

307

active site cysteine is mutated to an alanine, MLF2-M48C23A.

308

4TorKO cells were transfected with either variant and processed for immunofluorescence

309

with anti-FLAG and anti-K48-Ub antibodies 24 h post transfection. With a transfection

310

efficiency of about 50%, non-transfected cells serve as a convenient control. While non-

311

transfected cells display the expected K48-Ub foci phenotype, K48-Ub foci are virtually absent

312

from cells expressing MLF2-M48WT (Fig. 6C). However, MLF2-M48WT is still found in

313

perinuclear foci in a manner identical to canonical MLF2 staining (cf. Fig 6C and Fig. 3A or Fig.

314

S2A), indicating that blebs form independently of K48-Ub enrichment. In the case of

315

catalytically inactive MLF2-M48C23A, the signals of K48-Ub and MLF2-M48C23A show the

316

expected degree of colocalization, indicating that it is indeed the DUB activity that is responsible

317

for the lack of K48-Ub signal in MLF2-M48WT-transfected cells.

318
319

These data argue against a critical role for K48-Ub conjugation in bleb formation, while
establishing MLF2 as a useful tool to recruit specific enzymatic activities to NE blebs.

320
321

Diagnostic absence of late NPC assembly markers relative to FG nucleoporins

322

Nup358 is a cytosolic-facing Nup that is recruited to a nascent NPC after the assembly of

323

the bulk of the FG-Nups and the fusion of the INM and ONM (Otsuka et al., 2016). Therefore, as

324

we previously proposed, the absence of Nup358 from FG-Nup containing blebs may provide a

325

useful tool to assess whether these blebs are formed at sites of stalled NPC biogenesis (Chase et

326

al., 2017a). We therefore imaged WT and 4TorKO cells via three-dimensional structured

327

illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and compared the localization of Nup358 and other FG-Nups

328

using anti-Nup358 antibodies and the pan anti-FXFG antibody, Mab414, respectively. While we

329

recognize that Mab414 is capable, in principal, of labeling Nup358 (Wu et al., 1995), it was the

330

only antibody tested that provided the necessary specificity and signal-to-noise ratio to

331

confidently assign NPCs using SIM. Moreover, it is established that Mab414 favors labeling

332

Nup62 (Davis and Blobel, 1986) because it has more FXFG repeats and is found at higher copy

333

numbers in the NPC (when fully formed) compared to Nup358 (Ori et al., 2013). Thus, the

334

contribution of any Mab414-specific Nup358 labeling would likely be negligible.

335

Consistent with the idea that we can detect fully formed NPCs by SIM, we observe a

336

near-complete colocalization of the Mab414 and Nup358 signals in WT cells in focal planes that

337

illuminate the nuclear surface (Fig. 7A). Moreover, in mid-planes where NPCs are viewed by

338

cross section, it is apparent that the Nup358 signal is spatially separated from the Mab414 signal,

339

with the latter being more proximal and Nup358 being more distal relative to the nuclear interior.

340

This is in agreement with our current understanding of NPC structure (Lin and Hoelz, 2019;

341

Rout et al., 2000; Schwartz, 2016; von Appen et al., 2015). In this view, it is also clear that the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/821835; this version posted October 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

342

Mab414 does not detectably label Nup358, confirming our prior assumption with respect to the

343

specificity of Mab414. In contrast, in 4TorKO cells we observed irregularly shaped focal areas

344

with a diameter of up to 5 µm in which we saw robust staining with Mab414 at a density that is

345

comparable to WT cells, but with a notable absence of the anti-Nup358 label (Fig. 7A). This

346

suggests that these areas may represent the accumulation of stalled intermediates during NPC

347

assembly.

348

Finally, we quantified the total number of Mab414-foci based on seven nuclei each (from

349

three independent experiments) from WT and 4TorKO cells, which we interpret as the sum of

350

mature and immature NPCs. We observe a modest, albeit insignificant, reduction in the density

351

of Mab414 foci in 4TorKO cells suggesting that there is not a major reduction in NPCs or NPC

352

biogenesis sites in the absence of Torsins (Fig. 7B). However, when we compared the fraction of

353

colocalizing Nup358 and Mab414 foci as a measure for mature NPCs with the number of

354

Mab414 sites arbitrarily expressed as 100%, we observed a ~40% reduction in mature NPCs in

355

4TorKO cells relative to WT cells (Fig. 7C). This result is in good agreement with the observed

356

reduction of NPCs and the concomitant increase of bleb-localized, FG Nup-containing densities

357

in 4TorKO cells in electron micrographs (cf. Fig 7C and Fig. 1B).

358

In conclusion, the observed underrepresentation of Nup358 from sites containing FG

359

Nups is consistent with the interpretation that a large proportion of FG Nup-containing Nup

360

assemblies are devoid of cytoplasmic fibrils likely because NPC biogenesis is stalled at a step

361

prior to INM/ONM fusion.

362
363

POM121 is essential for bleb formation

364

Having shown that NE blebs in 4 TorKO cells feature NPC-like structures at their bases,

365

a key question that remains is whether a causal relationship of NPC components for NE blebbing

366

exists. An essential requirement of an NPC component for bleb biogenesis would lend significant

367

credence to the idea that NE blebs represent “frozen intermediates” during NPC formation

368

(Chase et al., 2017a; Laudermilch and Schlieker, 2016). Previous work established that the

369

mitotic insertion of NPCs during open mitosis requires ELYS, while insertion of NPCs after

370

reformation of the NE is independent of ELYS but highly sensitive to the depletion of the

371

transmembrane Nup POM121 (Doucet et al., 2010; Franz et al., 2007). Having shown that NE

372

blebs form after NE reformation (Fig. 5A), and given that these are topologically identical and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/821835; this version posted October 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

373

morphologically similar to NPC biogenesis intermediates (Laudermilch et al., 2016; Otsuka et

374

al., 2016), we reasoned that this selective dependency could be exploited by directly testing

375

whether ELYS and POM121 are implicated in bleb formation.

376

As a first step, we depleted either ELYS or POM121 in 4TorKO cells via siRNA-

377

mediated silencing and scored cells for any effects on K48-Ub foci formation. While both siRNA

378

treatments potently reduced the RNA levels of their targets, only POM121 led to a stark

379

reduction of K48-Ub focus formation, while silencing of ELYS had no significant effect (Fig.

380

8A-C). Since K48-Ub foci form relatively late during bleb formation (cf. Fig. 4D), we

381

additionally monitored bleb formation via EM to directly visualize membrane deformation

382

during bleb biogenesis under knockdown conditions (Fig. 8D and E). These results mirrored our

383

observations using K48-Ub as readout. Bleb formation was essentially unperturbed in ELYS-

384

silenced 4TorKO cells, whereas depletion of POM121 resulted in a stark, statistically significant

385

decrease in the number of blebs per NE length (Fig. 8D). Together, these data establish an

386

epistatic relationship between Torsins and the NPC component POM121. Considering that our

387

knockdown approach did not completely eliminate POM121 on the transcript level (Fig. 8B) but

388

nevertheless leads to a material reduction in bleb formation (Fig. 8D, E), it seems reasonable to

389

deduce that POM121 is strictly required for bleb formation.

391

Discussion

392

Nuclear envelope blebbing has been observed in developmentally regulated processes or

393

upon genetic perturbation of Nups in numerous model organisms (Thaller and Lusk, 2018).

394

Genetic ablation or mutation of specific Nups fall into the latter category, with NUP116

395

deletions being examples of NE blebs with morphological similarities relative to the ones seen in

396

4TorKO cells (Onischenko et al., 2017; Wente and Blobel, 1993). The identification of a subset

397

of FG-Nups at the electron-dense base of NE blebs in Torsin-deficient cells, as well as the

398

finding that the diameter of this density is similar to mature NPCs (Laudermilch et al., 2016),

399

previously suggested that Torsins could be implicated in NPC biogenesis (Chase et al., 2017a;

400

Laudermilch and Schlieker, 2016). The recent discovery an inside-out evagination in the context

401

of interphase NPC biogenesis (Otsuka et al., 2016) additionally revealed a phenomenon similar

402

to the effects seen upon Torsin manipulation (Fig. 1A) (Chase et al., 2017a; Otsuka et al., 2018b;

403

Weberruss and Antonin, 2016). Thus, several similarities exist between the two phenomena that

404

relate Torsins to NPC biogenesis.

405

In this study, we asked whether a causal relationship can be established between Torsins

406

and NPC biogenesis. We observed that the number of mature NPCs is strongly reduced in

407

4TorKO cells, with 23% of NPC-like structures being located at the base of NE blebs (Fig. 1A,

408

B). Using Ub as a marker for blebs in the context of fixed cells, the timing of bleb formation falls

409

mostly within the early G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 1C-F), a window of when a burst of

410

interphase NPC biogenesis has been observed (Dultz and Ellenberg, 2010). The observed

411

penetrance of this Torsin knockout phenotype (Fig. 1A, B) is remarkable if one considers the

412

estimate that about 50% of all NPCs are installed through interphase insertion (Doucet et al.,

413

2010).

414

Based on our identification of MLF2 as a bleb-specific marker (Fig. 2), we developed a

415

live cell imaging platform to show that bleb formation occurs synchronously within a narrow

416

window of time immediately after NE reformation following open mitosis (Fig. 5A,

417

Supplemental Video 1). Both the speed and synchrony of blebbing were entirely unexpected

418

since we assumed a much broader, “stochastic” emergence of blebs based on experiments with

419

fixed cells (Fig. 1D-F). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that a high degree of specificity exists for

420

the luminal content. Model substrates of nuclear transport and ribosomes (some of the major

421

nuclear export cargo) do not accumulate in these blebs (Fig. 3) (Laudermilch et al., 2016). This

422

argues against the formal possibility that blebs merely occur upon the packaging of “random”

423

nuclear export cargo. The question arises, however, as to whether K48-Ub or MLF2 play a role

424

in NPC biogenesis or whether they are merely sequestered in blebs. We did not observe a major

425

role for K48-Ub conjugation (Fig. 6C), and our preliminary MLF2 silencing approach did not

426

suggest a critical role for MLF2 in bleb formation (Fig. S2D and E). Whether this is due to a

427

possible genetic redundancy with the MLF2 homolog MLF1 remains to be seen. An alternative

428

possibility is that the sequestration of MLF2 into blebs detrimentally affects the normal function

429

of this protein, which is presently poorly understood (Banerjee et al., 2017; Kuefer et al., 1996).

430

Most importantly, our study firmly link Torsins to the process of interphase nuclear pore

431

biogenesis. Apart from the aforementioned kinetics of bleb formation, this functional assignment

432

is supported by the following observations: (i) a reduction in the number of mature pores (Fig.

433

1B), (ii) an underrepresentation of the late NPC assembly marker Nup358 from NEs of 4TorKO

434

cells (Fig. 7) and (iii) the strict requirement of POM121–a transmembrane Nup essential for

435

interphase assembly–for bleb formation (Fig. 8). In our model, NE blebbing during interphase

436

NPC biogenesis serves to bring the INM within a fusogenic distance of the ONM (Fig. 9B). In

437

this context, it might be useful to directly compare EM tomograms representing NE blebs in

438

4TorKO cells with those observed during interphase NPC biogenesis in unperturbed cells. The

439

latter are somewhat flatter and dome shaped (Otsuka et al., 2016) while larger membrane

440

herniations of about 200-250 nm are seen in 4TorKO cells (Laudermilch et al., 2016) (for a

441

diagrammatic comparison, see Fig. 9A and B).

442

How can we interpret this difference? We propose that in Torsin-deficient cells, the

443

otherwise dynamically linked processes of INM deformation and INM/ONM fusion during NPC

444

biogenesis is stalled before or at the step of INM/ONM fusion. As a first possibility, a specific

445

NPC component might require Torsin for folding or trafficking, and the observed effects are

446

indirect and result from a stalling since a specific required component is absent or misfolded.

447

Based on our observation that POM121 is required for bleb formation (Fig. 8), we deduce that

448

this component would likely have to be recruited downstream of POM121 in the assembly

449

pathway. This interpretation would be consistent with previous observations of Ub conjugation

450

in blebs. If we assume that one or several critical components important for NPC formation are

451

misfolded due to the absence of Torsins and consequently ubiquitylated, its mere

452

deubiquitylation would not be expected to restore protein function. As speculated before (Chase

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/821835; this version posted October 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

453

et al., 2017a; King and Lusk, 2016; Otsuka and Ellenberg, 2018), a second possibility is that

454

Torsins might act on fusogenic components responsible for INM/ONM fusion. Since the

455

fusogenic machinery remains to be identified, it is currently impossible to test this directly.

456

Finally, Torsins have recently been linked to lipid metabolism (Grillet et al., 2016; Shin et al.,

457

2019). We did not observe major changes in the lipid profile in 4TorKO cells vs. WT cells

458

(Laudermilch et al., 2016), but we cannot exclude that local, NE-specific changes in lipid

459

composition exist which might affect the fusogenic properties of NE membranes. It might be

460

interesting to employ lipid-specific probes to scrutinize lipid composition of NEs and its possible

461

perturbation in Torsin-deficient cells in the future.

462

Regarding the broader physiological implications of NE blebbing, it would be interesting

463

to compare naturally occurring instances where blebbing phenotypes closely mirroring our

464

observations have been documented (Thaller and Lusk, 2018). These include NE blebs during

465

the neuromuscular junction in D. melanogaster (Jokhi et al., 2013; Speese et al., 2012), as well

466

as NE blebbing that appears to be an evolutionary conserved process in zygotes and early

467

embryos. In the latter case, blebs with necks of dimensions similar to NPCs were observed,

468

although they have not been linked to NPC biogenesis (Szollosi and Szollosi, 1988). It will be

469

interesting to test whether these can be decorated with Mab414 antibodies, and if these structures

470

contain MLF2. It is tempting to speculate that several of these observations can in fact be

471

connected to NPC biogenesis.

472

Regardless of these questions, we interpret our results to firmly link Torsin ATPases to

473

the process of interphase NPC biogenesis. Our findings have distinct implications for our

474

understanding of movement disorders caused by Torsin dysfunction in neurons. Neuronal cells

475

display a low mitotic index and are thus expected to be particularly vulnerable since these are

476

more dependent on the interphase assembly pathway than dividing cells, which can utilize the

477

alternate post-mitotic insertion pathway. Additionally, neurons are heavily reliant on TorsinA

478

due to a window in neurogenesis during which TorsinA is the dominantly expressed Torsin

479

relative to its homologs (Kim et al., 2010; Tanabe et al., 2016).Thus, our results, along with these

480

data, suggest that defects in NPC biogenesis add to DYT1 dystonia’s disease etiology.

Materials and Methods

483

Tissue culture

484

Torsin-deficient HeLa cells and their parental WT cell line were cultured as previously

485

described (Laudermilch et al., 2016). Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s

486

Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and 100

487

units mL-1 of penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Cells were routinely checked

488

for mycoplasma and determined to be free of contamination through the absence of extranuclear

489

Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) staining.

490
491

Plasmids constructs

492

The sequence encoding MLF2 was amplified by standard PCR procedures from cDNA

493

(Dharmacon; Accession # BC000898) and subcloned into either a pcDNA3.1+ vector (MLF2-

494

HA and MLF2-Flag) or a pEGFP-N1 vector (MLF2-GFP). MLF2-M48 fusion variants were

495

constructed through standard Gibson assembly procedures. Plasmids containing the WT and

496

catalytic mutant variant of M48 were a gift from Hidde L. Ploegh (Whitehead Institute for

497

Biomedical Research) (Schlieker et al., 2007). The plasmid containing Sec61β was gifted from

498

Shirin Bahmanyar (Yale University). Sec61β was subcloned into a modified pEGFP-C1 vector in

499

which EGFP was replaced with mScarlet (pmScarlet-C1). Both MLF2-GFP and mScarlet-

500

Sec61β were subcloned into the pRetroX-Tight-Pur-GOI vector (Takara Bio). NES-GFP was

501

custom synthesized as a 789 bp gBlock gene fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies) with an

502

N-terminal nuclear export sequence (Cardarelli et al., 2012). NLS-GFP was gifted from Anton

503

Bennett (Yale School of Medicine). WT RAN was derived from pmCherry-C1-RanQ69L

504

(Addgene: 30309) by reverting the point mutation through site directed mutagenesis. WT RAN

505

was subcloned with an N-terminal HA tag into pcDNA3.1+.

506
507

Generation of HeLa stable cell lines

508

To generate a 4TorKO cell line stably expressing MLF2-GFP and mScarlet-Sec61β, we

509

employed the Retro-X Tet-On advanced inducible expression system (Takara Bio) following the

510

manufacturer’s protocol. For the production of retrovirus, low-passage 293T cells were

511

transfected with 2 µg MMLV gag/pol, 1 µg viral envelope protein VSV-G, and 6 µg of either

512

pRetroX-Tight-Pur-MLF2-GFP, pRetroX-Tight-Pur-mScarlet-Sec61β, or pRetroX-Tet-On using

513

X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche).

514

Supernatants containing retroviruses were collected 72 h post-transfection, filtered via a

515

0.45-μm filter unit, and stored at -80oC. 4TorKO cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24 hrs prior

516

to transduction. The next day, media was replaced with complete growth media supplemented

517

with 4 μg mL-1 polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 µL of the respective retroviruses were added

518

dropwise to the wells. Media was replaced 24-hours post transfection to fresh complete media

519

containing 1 µg mL-1 puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 800 μg mL-1 Geneticin (Thermo Fisher

520

Scientific). Antibiotic selection was performed for 7 days. Cells positive for both GFP and

521

mScarlet signal under the Dox-inducible promoter were isolated through fluorescence activated

522

cell sorting (FACS). FACS was performed at the Yale University Flow Cytometry Facility using

523

aFACS Aria III sorter (BD Biosciences).

524

To establish WT and 4TorKO cells stably expressing MLF2 with an endogenous C-

525

terminal 3xHA tag, we utilized a CRISPR/Cas12a system for PCR tagging genes (Fueller et al.,

526

2018). Oligo sequences targeting MLF2 at its endogenous locus were generated from an open

527

access tool (www.pcr-tagging.com). Sequences for the PCR tagging oligo primers are

Following selection, cells derived from individual colonies were screened for MLF2-3xHA

Cell synchronization

544

Cells were synchronized with a double thymidine block (Bostock et al., 1971). Cells were

545

incubated in complete growth media supplemented with 2.5 mM thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for

546

18 h. Cells were released from the thymidine block by washing with Dulbecco's phosphate-

547

buffered saline (DPBS) (Thermo Fischer Scientific), and replacing the media with fresh

548

complete growth media. Cells were incubated for 9 h at which point a second round of 2.5 mM

549

thymidine treatment was administered. Following a 16-hour incubation, cells were again washed

550

and incubated in complete growth media without thymidine. This final media replacement was

551

designated as T = 0, and time points were then collected afterwards as indicated in the text.

siRNA knockdown was done using Lipofectamine RNAimax (Life Technologies). The

555

Lipofectamine reagent was diluted in Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (Thermo Fischer

556

Scientific) for 15 min, followed by the addition of the appropriate concentration of siRNA and

557

incubated further for 15 min. This solution was then added dropwise to cells and allowed to

558

incubate overnight. Media was then replaced with fresh antibiotic-free media. Cells were

559

harvested for qPCR or immunofluorescence (IF) 48 h (siNT, siELYS, and siMLF2) or 72 h

CAGUGGCAGUGGACAAUUCA[dT][dT]-3’

562

UCGUGGAAAGUUUGCUGCAGGGAAA[dT][dT]-3’ (Sigma) (Doucet et al., 2010) were used

563

for POM121 and ELYS, respectively, while SMARTpool siRNA was utilized to target MLF2

564

(Dharmacon). Following treatment, cells were either fixed for IF analysis or total RNA was

565

extracted for qPCR following previously described methods (Tsai et al., 2016). In short, 100 ng

566

of RNA was transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher

567

Scientific) with random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). qPCR was performed using iQ SYBR

568

Green mix and executed on a CFX Real-Time PCR 639 Detection System (Bio-Rad). The ΔΔCt

569

values for each sample were calculated from the subtraction of an internal control value

570

(GAPDH) and results were normalized to the siNT control. Primer sequences (5’-3’) utilized for

571

qPCR were as follows: GAPDH (Forward: CGACCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCG; Reverse:

Nuclear envelope isolation and K48 ubiquitin immunoprecipitation

579

The isolation of NE membranes was modified from previously described methods (Emig

580

et al., 1995; Tsai et al., 2019). Briefly, WT and 4TorKO cells were collected from 5 15-cm plates

581

and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes at 4oC. Cells were resuspended in cold PBS and 100 µL

582

of cells were set aside for WCL input controls. Cells were again centrifuged and resuspended in

583

5 mL of cold Buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 2 mM MgCl2) supplemented

584

with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and incubate on ice for 10 min. Cells were

585

then homogenized by passing through a 25G needle 5 times. Homogenates were transferred to

586

the top of 10mL STM 0.9 buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.9 M sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2) and

587

sedimented at 1,000 x g for 10 min. Pellets containing crude nuclear fractions were resuspend in

588

5 mL STM 1.6 buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1.6 M sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2,1 mM PMSF).

589

Suspensions were underlayed with 1 mL STM 2.1 buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2.1 M sucrose, 5

590

mM MgCl2) and 4 mL STM 0.8 buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.8 M sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2) was

591

added as the top layer. Pure nuclear fractions were sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 28,500

592

rpm (rotor SW41) for 65 min. Nuclear pellets were washed once in 1 mL TP buffer (10 mM Tris,

593

pH 8.0, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 5 mM MgCl2) and sedimented at 1000 x g for 10 min at 4oC. Nuclear

594

pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL TP buffer supplemented with heparin (7.2 mg / 24 ml

595

buffer), 1 µL benzonase, and 2 mM NEM and rocked at 4oC for 2 h. Samples were centrifuged at

596

15,000 x g for 10 min at 4oC. Supernatants containing NP fractions were saved and pellets

597

containing NE fractions were solubilize in 1 mL solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5

598

mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl and 2% digitonin, 1mM PMSF, 2mM NEM) on ice for 30 min.

599

Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4oC and the supernatant was transferred to

600

a clean microcentrifuge tube. A 15µL aliquot was set aside to assess the quality of the

607

Eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a Mini-PROTEAN precast gel (Bio-Rad).

608

Immunoblotting was performed to assess the quality of the fractionation protocol with anti-

609

SUN2 antibody (AB_1977547, Millipore), and anti-HA antibody (AB_390919, Roche) at a

610

1:5000 and a 1:4000 dilution, respectively. Gels for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis were

611

stained with SimplyBlue Safe Stain (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and gel samples were sent to the

612

Yale NHLBI Proteomics Center for LC-MS/MS. MS proteomic data was analyzed with Scaffold

613

(Proteome Software Inc., Portland, Oregon).

615

Transmission electron microscopy

616

Electron microscopy was performed at the Center for Cellular and Molecular Imaging,

617

Yale School of Medicine with a previously described workflow (Laudermilch et al., 2016).

618

Briefly, cells were fixed for 1 h in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH

619

7.4. Following a brief rinse, cells were scrapped in 1% gelatin and centrifuged in a 2% agar

620

solution. Chilled cell blocks were processed with osmium and thiocarbohydrazide-osmium

621

liganding as previously described (West et al., 2010), and samples were embedded in Durcupan

622

ACM resin (Electron Microscopy Science). Polymerization was performed by incubating

623

samples at 60°C overnight. These blocks were cut into 60 nm sections with a Leica UltraCut

624

UC7, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate on Formvar/carbon-coated grids.

625

Samples for immunoelectron microscopy were processed as described above with some

626

modifications. Samples were fixed through high-pressure freezing (Leica EM HPM100) and

627

freeze substitution (Leica AFS) at 2000 PSI. Freeze substitution was performed by incubating

628

samples in 0.1% uranyl acetate/acetone solution for 50 h at -90oC. Following treatment, samples

629

were washed in acetone, infiltrated in Lowicryl HM20 resin (Electron Microscopy Science) for

630

10 h at -45oC, transferred to gelatin capsules, and hardened via ultraviolet light exposure at -

631

45oC. Blocks were subsequently sectioned and placed on Formvar/carbon-coated nickel grids for

632

immunolabeling. Untreated aldehyde groups were quenched by incubating grids in 0.1 M

633

ammonium chloride prior to immunolabeling procedure. Samples were subsequently blocked in

634

1% fish-skin gelatin in PBS and grids were incubated in a 1:50 dilution of anti-GFP antibody

635

(AB_390913, Roche) and labeled with 10 nm Protein A-gold particles (Utrecht Medical Center).

636

Grids were fixed using 1% glutaraldehyde, washed with PBS, dried, and stained using 2% uranyl

637

acetate and lead citrate.

638

Both conventional EM and immunogold labeled samples were visualized with an FEI

639

Tecnai Biotwin TEM at 80Kv and pictures were taken with Morada CCD and iTEM (Olympus)

640

software.

641
642

Immunofluorescence for wide field fluorescence and confocal microscopy

643

IF staining was done as previously described (Laudermilch et al., 2016; Rose et al., 2014;

644

Tsai et al., 2016). Briefly, cells were cultured on coverslips (VWR), fixed with 4%

645

paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, and permeabilized for 10 mins with 0.1% Triton-X 100

646

(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Cells were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-

647

Aldrich) in PBS for 10 mins and incubated with the appropriate antibodies for 45 mins. The

648

following antibodies were used at a 1:500 concentration: anti-K48 ubiquitin (AB_11213655,

649

Millipore), anti-HA (AB_390919, Roche), and anti-Flag (AB_259529, Sigma-Aldrich). After

650

five washes, cells were blocked with 4% BSA and incubated with secondary antibodies

651

conjugated to Alexa-Fluor™ 488 (Life Technologies) or Alexa-Fluor™ 568 (Life Technologies)

652

for 45 mins. Cells were washed with PBS, incubated in Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) for 5

653

mins, and washed in PBS wash before being mounted onto slides using Fluoromount-G

654

(Southern Biotech).

655

Standard wide field images were obtained with a Zeiss Axio Observer D1 microscope

656

using a 63x oil immersion objective. Confocal images were taken with an LSM 880 laser

657

scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a C Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27

658

objective.

Immunofluorescence for 3D-SIM

661

Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 mins and washed with PBS.

662

Blocking and antibody dilutions were carried out in 3% BSA in PBS with 0.1% Triton-X 100.

663

After 1 h blocking, cells were incubated with an anti-Nup358 antibody (kind gift of Gunter

664

Blobel/Elias Coutavas) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Cells were washed with three times

665

with PBS for 5 min each and incubated with Alexa-Fluor™ 568 goat anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher

666

Scientific) for 1 h at RT. Cells were washed as described above and then incubated with the

667

Mab414 antibody (1:500, Abcam) for 1 h. Cells were washed as described above and then

668

incubated with Alexa-Fluor™ 488 goat anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at RT.

3D-SIM

673

3D-SIM imaging was performed on a DeltaVision OMX V3 system (GE Healthcare Life

674

Sciences) equipped with a U-PLANAPO 60X/1.42 PSF oil immersion objective lens (Olympus,

675

Center Valley, PA), CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera with a pixel size of 0.080 µm (Photometrics)

676

and 488 nm, 561 nm, and 642 nm solid-state lasers (Coherent and MPB communications). Image

677

stacks were acquired in 0.125 µm increments in the z-axis in sequential imaging mode. Samples

678

were illuminated by a coherent scrambled laser light source first passed through a diffraction

679

grating to generate the structured illumination by interference of light orders in the image plane

680

to create a 3D sinusoidal pattern, with lateral stripes approximately 0.270 µm apart. The pattern

681

was shifted laterally through five phases and through three angular rotations of 60º for each Z-

682

section, separated by 0.125 µm. Exposure times were typically between 25 and 150 ms, and the

683

power of each laser was adjusted to achieve optimal fluorescence intensities between 2,000 and

684

4,000 in a raw image of 16-bit dynamic range, at the lowest possible laser power to minimize

685

photo bleaching. Color channels were carefully aligned using alignment parameters from control

686

measurements with 0.5 µm diameter multi-spectral fluorescent beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

687

The 3D-SIM images were subjected to SIM reconstruction and image processing using

688

the SoftWoRx 3.7 imaging software package (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The channels were

689

then aligned in x, y, and rotationally using predetermined shifts as measured using a target lens

690

and the SoftWoRx alignment tool (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).

698

10% FBS equilibrated to 37oC. MLF2-GFP and mScarlet-Sec61β were excited using a 488-nm

699

laser and a 560-nm laser, respectively, with inner and outer numeric apertures of 0.325 and 0.4,

700

respectively, and 5 ms exposure times. Imaging data was acquired with a sCMOS camera

701

(Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 v3). Metaphase cells were identified, and three-dimensional data

702

sets were recorded with 20 s intervals between time points. All LLSM data was deconvolved

703

with the Janelia open source software cudaDeconv (Janelia).

704
705

Image processing and data analysis

706

All indirect IF, confocal, and 3D SIM images were processed for figures and analyzed with FIJI

707

software (Schindelin et al., 2012). In addition to FIJI software, LLSM images were also

708

processed with FluoRender 2.19 (Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, Salt Lake City,

709

UT).

710

Quantifications of blebs were performed as previously described (Rose et al., 2014).

711

Briefly, cells were randomly selected using the Hoechst channel and were imaged for K48

712

ubiquitin staining. Nuclei were outlined manually, and the number of foci per nucleus was

713

determined by the “Find Maxima” function in FIJI with a noise tolerance of 10. A threshold was

714

set by comparison to wild type nuclei, and cells above the threshold were determined to contain

715

K48-Ub foci. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism.

716

Line scan analyses were performed in FIJI. The nuclear periphery of a given region was

717

traced with the segmented line selection tool and the same trace was superimposed on

718

subsequent channels for consistency through the “Restore Selection” function. A plot of the

719

intensity profile for the selected region was generated through the “Plot Profile” function and all

720

data was exported and graphed using GraphPad Prism.

721

Quantifications for the increase in fluorescence intensities of MLF2-GFP foci were

722

performed in FIJI. Individual foci were traced with the freehand selection tool and the average

723

pixel intensities per foci area were determined through the measure function. Average

724

fluorescence intensities are represented as relative intensities units (RIU) and the RIU values of

725

each foci for a given time point are normalized by subtracting the background intensity of the

726

same area of a respective focus. Data was exported and graphed using GraphPad Prism

822

cells treated with 100 nM non-targeting (NT) siRNA, ELYS siRNA or POM121 siRNA. Cells

823

were stained with an anti-K48-Ub antibody. Representative scale bar is 10 µm. (B) The relative

824

amount of ELYS and POM121 mRNA transcripts following 50 nM or 100 nM siRNA treatments

825

were analyzed by RT-qPCR with the indicated primers. Relative mRNA levels were normalized

826

to the siNT control. The values are means of three independent replicates (n = 3) and error bars

827

indicate ± SD. (C) Graph of the percent of cells with K48-Ub foci after treatment with 100 nM of

828

the indicated siRNAs. Each result is the average of three independent experiments with at least

829

75 cells each. (D) Graph of the number of blebs observed per EM cross section upon treatment

830

with 100 nM of the indicated siRNA. Each point shows the number of blebs per 30 µM of NE in

831

an individual cross section. The average blebs per 30 µM of NE is shown by the bar graph and

832

the standard error of the mean is shown in the error bars. At least 30 cells from each sample were

833

counted. (E) EM images of 4TorKO control cells or cells treated with 100 nM siRNA targeting

Figure 9: Models of normal interphase NPC assembly and defective NPC biogenesis resulting

838

from Torsin manipulation. (A) Following mitosis, NPC assembly occurs via an inside-out

839

evagination of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) in a process that requires the recruitment of

840

POM121. Nuclear ring components and NPC subcomplexes are shuttled through mature pores

841

previously assembled through a post-mitotic insertion mechanism. As pore intermediates mature,

842

Nups that presumably deform the membrane evagination are added in a process that drives the

843

growth of the complex both laterally and towards the outer nuclear membrane (ONM)

844

(Intermediate I). Following a membrane fusion event, late stage and cytoplasmic Nups like

845

Nup358 are added (Intermediate II) and the pore experiences significant architectural

846

rearrangements ultimately giving rise to a complete NPC (III). (B) The formation of NE

847

aberrations resulting from defective interphase assembly of NPCs upon Torsin manipulation or

848

depletion. Interphase assembly begins in a POM121-dependent manner and pore intermediates

849

mature to a stage that precedes membrane fusion (intermediate I). MLF2 is recruited early in the

850

biogenesis of NE herniations, likely during the recruitment of early stage Nups, and is enriched

851

in the lumen of the mature herniation. The INM proximal to the ONM expands to give rise to an

852

omega-shaped herniation of the NE (Intermediate II). Specific protein components of the

853

herniations including MLF2 are then labeled with K48 ubiquitin chains (Intermediate III). These

854

structures are static through interphase and are turned over at the onset of mitosis.

Supplemental Figure 1: Distinct stages of the NPC lifecycle. Graphical depiction of various

857

stages of the NPC lifecycle. During mitosis, NPCs are disassembled and the nuclear envelope

858

retreats to the ER (top panel). NPCs can then assemble as cells exit mitosis via the post-mitotic

859

pathway (right panel) or during interphase (bottom panel). Pores formed by both pathways are

860

likely stable until mitosis (left panel).
