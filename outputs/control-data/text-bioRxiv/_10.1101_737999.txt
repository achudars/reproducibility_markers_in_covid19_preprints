Results

Overall performance exhibited signatures predicted by computational models of decision-making
and metacognition.

Thirty-seven human observers performed a two-alternative forced choice (2-

AFC) orientation discrimination task (Fig. 1A and Methods). Participants judged whether a briefly

presented Gabor patch was tilted leftward or rightward of the vertical plane, and reported the level

of confidence they felt in their decision (on a scale of 1 – ‘Not confident at all’ to 4 – ‘Highly

confident’). The true orientation (and hence task difficulty) was manipulated from trial-to-trial. This

design allowed us to test predictions arising from a recently proposed computational model of

perceptual decision-making and metacognition based on Bayesian statistical confidence and signal

detection theory (SDT), as defined in Figure 1B (and Methods). Briefly, human decisions have been

modelled as the comparison of an internal decision variable (DV), representing the evidence in

favour of one or other choice in 2-AFC tasks, against a decision criterion (C). Under this model,

confidence in the decision is given by the distance of the DV from C

4,5,16,33-35

. When a discrete

confidence rating scale is employed, the level of confidence is defined by where the DV falls with

respect to the so-called type-2 criteria (

c1, c2,

…

cN−1)

), where N indexes the number of possible

ratings. A confidence rating of k will follow if the DV falls in the interval (

ck−1, ck).

This model gives rise to several predictions regarding the relationships between stimulus evidence,

accuracy and decision confidence

16,34,36-38

: (1) Accuracy should scale with evidence strength (Fig. 1C);

(2) Conditioning type-1 performance on high or low confidence ratings should change the slope of

the relationship between stimulus evidence and accuracy, with a steeper slope for high relative to

low confidence trials (Fig. 1C); (3) Confidence should increase with evidence strength for correct

trials, but decrease with evidence strength for incorrect trials (Fig. 1D); (4) Even when there is no

veridical evidence in favour of one response or other, confidence should be above 0 (Fig. 1D). These

predictions were all confirmed in our data. Accuracy increased as a function of evidence strength but

participants reliably reported some level of confidence in decisions even when the Gabor patch was

vertically aligned and hence there was no informative evidence (Fig. 1G).

Choice history bias occurs in both perceptual and metacognitive decisions, but is stronger in
metacognition.

Next, we investigated the degree to which choice history biases both perceptual and

metacognitive responses. Across all trials, no systematic group-level bias in favour of either choice

was apparent (t-test of psychometric function (PF) thresholds versus 0°: t(36) = .1497, p = .8818,

(t(36) = 1.775, p = .084, BF 10 = 0.731) nor 6° (t(36) = 1.972, p = .056, BF 10 = 1). In sum, perceptual

choices influenced decision criteria for both perceptual and metacognitive subsequent choices.

To investigate the influence of the previous metacognitive choice, we performed the same analysis

but this time for ‘post-high’ and ‘post-low’ confidence trials (two bins split as evenly as possible

within each participant: see Methods). Previous confidence did not influence perceptual sensitivity

(Fig. 4A:

effect increasing as a function of orientation (Fig. 4B-C). For metacognitive sensitivity, follow-up t-

tests showed that the effect was significant for orientations of 3°, 9°, 12°, 15°, 18° (t-values ≥2.413,

p-values ≤.021, BF10 ≥ 2.239) but not for 6° (t(36) = .457, p = .65, BF10 = 0.195). For metacognitive

efficiency, the effect was significant for 9°, 12°, 15°, 18° (t-values ≥3.368, p-values ≤.002, BF10 ≥

18.449) but not for 3° (t(36) = 1.737, p = .091, BF 10 = 0.689) nor 6° (t(36) = .18, p = .858, BF10 = 0.179).

effect decreasing as a function of orientation (Fig. 4F: linear contrast F(1,36) = 6.771, p = .013).
Follow-up t-tests showed that the effect was significant for orientations of 3°, 6°, 9°, 12°, 15° (tvalues ≥ 2.739, p-values ≤ .01, BF10 ≥ 4.37) but not for 18° (t(36) = 1.066, p = .203, BF10 = 0.299).
Hence, metacognitive choice history influenced all aspects of metacognitive performance
(sensitivity, efficiency and bias), but did not influence perceptual sensitivity nor bias.

Choice alternation is associated with increased perceptual sensitivity but reduced metacognitive
insight. Next, we investigated directly whether repeating (versus alternating) the previous choice
was associated with changes in either perceptual and/or metacognitive performance. Figure 5 plots
metacognitive history bias effects separately for ‘repetition’ (Fig. 5A) and ‘alternation’ trials (Fig. 5B).
For both, confidence increased as a function of orientation but also tended to be shifted towards
previous ratings. Confidence was positively predicted by previous ratings for both repetition (t(36) =
11.88, p < .001, BF10 = 1.4145e+11) and alternation trials (t(36) = 6.6953, p < .001, BF10 =
1.7697e+05). However, the effect was significantly stronger for repetition trials (t(36) = 5.0343, p <
.001, BF10 = 1.5439e+03). Intriguingly, computational modelling revealed a novel dissociation of
perceptual and metacognitive sensitivity induced by disengagement from choice hysteresis. When
participants alternated from their previous choice, they were more likely to be correct than when
they repeated (Fig. 5C: d’ main effect: F(1,36) = 68.841, p < .001; interaction: F(5,180) = 2.763, p =
.02). The effect was significant at all orientations (t-values ≥ 2.709, p-values ≤ .01, BF10 ≥ 4.1) but
increased as a function of orientation (linear contrast: F(1,36) = 13.284, p = .001). However, this
improvement in perceptual sensitivity for alternation trials was not reflected in metacognitive
sensitivity (Fig. 5D: meta-d’ (main effect: F(1,36) = 1.311, p = .26; interaction: F(5,180) = .932, p =
.462)). Hence, objective accuracy increased for alternation relative to repetition trials whereas
metacognitive efficiency decreased (Fig. 5E: meta-d’–d’ main effect: F(1,36) = 27.262, p < .001;
interaction: F(5,180) = 2.321, p = .045). The meta-d’–d’ effect was significant at orientations of 6°, 9°,
12°, 15°, 18° (t-values ≤ -2.2, p-values ≤ .033, BF10 ≥ 1.552), but not 3° (t(36) = -1.303, p = .201, BF10 =
0.385), and increased as a function of orientation (F(1,36) = 9.899, p = .003).

Choice hysteresis did not influence either perceptual or metacognitive decision criteria (Fig. 5F-H: Fvalues ≤ 1.685, p-values ≥ .14). Overall, participants lacked full metacognitive insight into the
increased likelihood of being correct when they alternated from their previous perceptual response.

Choice history biases are associated with reduced perceptual and metacognitive sensitivity, but
not reduced metacognitive insight, across participants. Finally, we investigated the correlation
between perceptual and metacognitive history biases (Fig. 6A), and whether they contribute to
suboptimal perceptual and metacognitive sensitivity, across participants. The strength of perceptual
bias did not predict the strength of metacognitive bias (Pearson’s r = 0.1072, p = .5278, BF10 = 0.156).
Metacognitive history bias was stronger in most participants (MI(Conf-1;Conf)>MI(Resp-1;Resp),

History biases have previously been linked to reduced perceptual19 and metacognitive sensitivity31,
and we replicated these findings here. The perceptual bias was inversely related to perceptual
sensitivity (d’) (Fig. 6B: r = -0.5877, p < .001, BF10 = 179.836) and the metacognitive bias was
inversely related to metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d’) (Fig. 6C: r = -0.4315, p = .0077, BF10 = 4.353).
Perceptual history bias was not significantly associated with metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d’) and
metacognitive history bias was not significantly associated with perceptual sensitivity (d’)
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
Previously, a negative correlation was found between metacognitive history bias and metacognitive
sensitivity (as quantified by the area under the Type-2 receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
(Type-2 AUC))31. However, neither type-2 AUC nor meta-d’ account for type-1 performance, and
hence do not represent pure measures of metacognitive insight/efficiency5,42. Therefore, to establish
the relationships between perceptual and metacognitive history biases and metacognitive insight,
we correlated both with metacognitive efficiency (meta-d’–d’). A weak positive correlation was
found between perceptual history bias and metacognitive efficiency (Fig. 6D: r = 0.3437, p = .0373,
BF10 = 1.101). The BF10 did not provide strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis therefore we
do not interpret this further. However, a one-tailed analysis to test for a negative relationship
revealed strong evidence for the null hypothesis (BF10 = 0.07). A non-significant negative relationship
was observed between metacognitive history bias and metacognitive efficiency (Fig. 6E: r = -0.1852,
p = .2726, BF10 = 0.233). Hence, when the contribution of type-1 performance to absolute
metacognitive sensitivity was factored out, history biases were not significantly associated with
reduced metacognitive insight across participants. Note that similar results were found using a ratio
measure of metacognitive efficiency/insight (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Using MI to quantify history biases eliminates information about the bias direction (i.e. ‘Repeater’
versus ‘Alternator’). For the sake of completeness, the same correlation analyses using metrics
which retain the bias direction are reported in Supplementary Figure 5.

Discussion
Human decisions are often influenced by sources other than the relevant information1,2,44,45.
Understanding sub-optimal decision-making represents a fundamental enterprise in modern
psychology and neuroscience46. In line with previous studies, we show that choice history represents
a source of task-irrelevant choice variability, both for perceptual decisions16-21,27 and confidence
reports31. Most participants displayed positive history biases: they were more likely to repeat
perceptual decisions and confidence ratings even though stimuli were presented in a random order
and hence previous choices were of no relevance. Crucially, we quantified both perceptual and
metacognitive history biases on a common effect size scale (using MI) and estimated single-subject
significance and population prevalence of the respective effects. Additionally, by employing
computational modelling of perceptual decisions and confidence ratings, we were able to uncover
latent parameters which are influenced by choice history at different levels of the decision-making
hierarchy. Across participants, perceptual and metacognitive history biases did not correlate with
each other, but were independently associated with reduced perceptual and metacognitive
sensitivity, whereas neither bias predicted metacognitive insight. We show for the first time that the
perceptual and metacognitive biases influence distinct type-1 (perceptual) and type-2
(metacognitive) aspects of decision-making, and the metacognitive bias is stronger and likely to be
more prevalent in the general population. These observations are of fundamental relevance for
contemporary models of decision-making and confidence, suggesting that recent confidence
represents a mental shortcut (heuristic) which informs self-reflection when more relevant
information is unavailable.

A normative model posits that confidence computations reflect the probability of being correct in a
statistically optimal manner33,34,36,47, in line with suggestions that the computation of confidence
arises from the same neural processes as the decision itself48-51. The normative model relates
confidence to the available evidence through a conditional Bayesian posterior probability17,36,44 and
several of the model predictions were met in the current dataset using explicit confidence ratings of
visual discrimination performance (see Fig 1B-H). This suggests that subjective confidence is to some
extent consistent with normative statistical principles, though it should be noted that a first-order
normative model is not the only model which gives rise to such predictions38. However, the influence
of choice history on confidence ratings (see Fig 2C-G) shows that the normative model alone cannot
fully account for subjective confidence. Rather, the normative computation may be one of several
determinants of confidence34, and differential weighting of these determinants may explain
individual differences in the degree of metacognitive history bias and overall metacognitive
sensitivity. Other factors which have been suggested to influence confidence judgements include
context52, social pressure12,53, attention54,55 and fatigue56. Our approach allowed us to quantify and
compare the degree to which confidence judgements were driven by objective evidence versus
preceding confidence ratings. Surprisingly, we found a relatively even split of participants for whom
the objective evidence most strongly influenced confidence versus participants for whom previous
ratings were a stronger influence (Fig. 2G). In contrast, all but one participant showed a stronger
influence of objective evidence on perceptual choices than the influence of previous choices (Fig.
2F). Metacognitive judgements are thus more susceptible to bias from extraneous factors than
perceptual decisions, an observation which may be of practical relevance in terms of learning, error
monitoring and psychological well-being9-13. Further research may investigate whether primarily
‘history’ versus ‘evidence’ based metacognitive styles meaningfully predict differences in influential
traits such as cognitive flexibility, personality and/or psychiatric symptomology.
The current results align with models positing that confidence judgements arise from processes
which are to some degree dissociable from the decision process itself5,38,57, with distinct neural

implementations and independent influences. Evidence supporting such a dissociation has come
from neuroimaging7,8,35,58-64, psychophysics32,65,66, brain stimulation67,68 and clinical14,69,70 studies.
Several aspects of our findings accord with a ‘second-order’ computation of confidence. First,
participants were generally unable to make use of all of the information available for their
perceptual decisions when rating confidence, which indicates ‘noise’ in the metacognitive system
and sub-optimal insight71,72. Second, perceptual and metacognitive history biases were uncorrelated
across participants (Fig. 6A) and impacted on distinct latent decision-making parameters (Figs. 3+4).
For instance, type-2 (metacognitive) decision criteria were modulated as a function of prior
confidence ratings independently of the type-1 (perceptual) criteria (Fig. 4D-F), and alternating from
choice hysteresis was associated with increased perceptual sensitivity but reduced metacognitive
insight (Fig 5A-C). This dissociation when disengaging from choice hysteresis, reported here for the
first time, adds to previous reports suggesting that accuracy and confidence can be un-coupled even
in healthy participants55,68,71. Thus, confidence computations must operate, at least partly, on an axis
which is dissociable from type-1 decisions43. We did find evidence for some level of interaction
between perceptual and metacognitive history biases. The metacognitive bias was strongest for
trials in which the perceptual choice was repeated, though it remained significant also for
alternation trials (Fig. 5A-B). This suggests that some level of ‘shared’ hysteresis occurs across both
systems. However, in contrast to previous findings16,17,32, preceding confidence had no influence on
the likelihood of the perceptual choice being repeated. Subtle but important differences in
experimental designs may explain this discrepancy (see Supplementary Figure 1).
Why might perceptual and metacognitive decision processes be dissociable? One possibility is that
the nature of everyday decision-making renders the utilisation of all type-1 information for
metacognitive reflection either impossible or unnecessary71. As is known for decision-making,
metacognitive judgements might rely partly on heuristics and simplifications which result in
systematic biases under particular conditions, including lab-based tasks with high levels of
uncertainty8,71,73-75. In natural settings, it may generally be advantageous to assume statistical

regularity of environmental stimuli and to default to this model/heuristic under conditions of high
uncertainty27,28. If the metacognitive system has less access to objective evidence than the
perceptual system, then stronger history biases of confidence ratings are likely to occur. Indeed,
here confidence ratings were less sensitive to the objective evidence than perceptual choices and
were also more strongly biased by previous ratings.
The mechanisms underlying history biases remain unclear, though neural signatures encoding
previous perceptual choices have been identified across various sensory, associative and motor brain
regions26,76-78. Recent studies have investigated perceptual history bias within the context of
computational models of decision-making. The drift-diffusion model (DDM)79 represents an
extension of classic SDT incorporating single-trial dynamics of evidence accumulation. Under this
model, biasing of the type-1 criterion by previous choices (Fig 3D) could occur due to asymmetry in
either the starting point or drift rate of the evidence accumulation process. Urai et al.,20 show
compelling evidence across six tasks that drift rate bias provides the best account, in line with
persistence of decisional weights over time/trials18,27, an interpretation which is fully in line with our
results. An intriguing avenue for further research would be to model the temporal dynamics of both
type-1 and type-2 decisions57 in order to ascertain the mechanism(s) of history induced type-2
criterion shifts (Fig 4E-F). Additionally, by combining such an approach with functional
neuroimaging35,49, neural correlates of model parameters may reveal the neural implementations
underlying both perceptual and metacognitive choices themselves, along with history biases.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report estimates of the population prevalence of both
perceptual and metacognitive choice history biases. We employed information theoretic statistics to
quantify aspects of decision-making within individual participants on a common effect size scale.
These measures also enable computationally efficient non-parametric within-participant inference.
This novel approach could be widely applied to different questions in studies of decision-making. We
found that metacognitive history bias was significant in almost all of our sample (34/37), allowing us

to infer an estimate of the population prevalence of 91.5% [80.1 100] (maximum likelihood with 95%
bootstrap confidence interval). That is, we can expect that at least 80% of the general population
would have an effect detectable with our experimental design (i.e. statistically significant at p=0.05
from 416 trials). The perceptual history bias was significant at the group-level, but was only
significant in 13/37 of our sample, yielding a population prevalence estimate of 31.7% [14.6 48.8].
Statistical inference in psychology traditionally focusses on population mean effects, but we argue
that it is crucial to determine the degree to which the effects can be reliably observed within
individuals, and the prevalence of these effects in the population.
The extent to which these biases negatively influence everyday decisions remains unclear, though
repeating previous choices in situations of uncertainty may serve to preserve neural resources
associated with choice alternation and to maintain self-consistency8. Indeed, activation of a specific
cortical network involving inferior frontal cortex and the subthalamic nucleus during the decision
process is associated with disengagement from choice hysteresis80. This suggests that switching
choices under conditions of uncertainty comes at a computational cost. It is interesting to speculate
that engagement of this network might improve performance but not subjective confidence in the
choice, thereby explaining the lack of metacognitive insight our participants displayed, despite
increased perceptual sensitivity, when alternating from their previous choice (Fig. 5A-C).
Furthermore, the drive for hysteresis/self-consistency may induce uncertainty when choices are
switched and hence distort metacognitive judgements.
It is possible that such biases could have negative implications in circumstances where significant
decisions must be made under conditions of high uncertainty (i.e. security scanning, medical
imaging81). Furthermore, miscalibrated metacognitive judgement (systematic under- or overconfidence) is likely to impact on learning, adaptive decision-making and mental health9-15, and may
be compounded by history and confirmation biases. The development of behavioural and/or

pharmacological techniques to reduce such biases can help to optimise accurate decision-making
and self-reflection.

Method
Participants
Forty-three healthy human observers participated in the study. All reported normal or corrected-tonormal vision. Due to poor psychophysical performance (explained in the

Data Exclusion section), 6

participants were excluded from the analysis, leaving a total number of 37 participants (26
female/11 male aged from 18 to 38 years (M = 25.23,

SD = 3.95)). The study was approved by the

Ethics Committee of the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Glasgow and all
participants gave their informed consent. No monetary reward was given to participants for taking
part, though undergraduate students could receive course credits for their participation.

Stimuli and task
The stimuli were Gabor patches (windowed sine wave gratings: 96 x 96 pixels (2.54 x 2.45 cm))
presented at the centre of the screen. The Gabor patches had a peak contrast of 100% Michelson, a
spatial frequency of 3.7 cycles per degree and a 0.3° standard deviation Gaussian contrast envelope.
At a viewing distance of 57 cm (fixed using a chinrest), Gabor patches subtended 2.55° of visual
angle. On each trial, the stimulus would appear at a random angle that ranged from -18° to +18°
relative to vertical at intervals of 3° (including 0°). The monitor used to present the stimuli had a
display refresh rate of 60Hz and screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The software used to
implement the task was E-prime 2.0 and participants made responses using a QWERTY keyboard.
Each trial began with a fixation point displayed at the centre of the screen for 1000ms (see Fig. 1A).
Following this, a Gabor patch appeared at a random orientation in the centre of the screen for a
duration of 16ms. After the stimulus disappeared, the participant viewed the fixation point for
400ms, before being instructed to indicate whether they perceived the top of the Gabor patch to be

tilted in a “leftward” or “rightward” direction relative to vertical (2-alternative forced choice), by
responding with the left and right arrow keys respectively. Participants were not informed as to the
accuracy of their choice and no time limit was enforced. Immediately after responding, participants
were presented with a second decision regarding their confidence about the perceptual choice they
had just made. Participants were asked to rate their confidence on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1
represented “not confident at all” and 4 represented “highly confident”, using the corresponding
digit keys on the keyboard. Immediately after making this response the central fixation point
reappeared

trial.

A short practice block (12 trials), including only the most extreme angles (-18°, +18°) and with
accuracy feedback on each trial, was performed in order to familiarise participants with the task. In
the full experiment, each of the 13 orientations was presented 32 times in a randomised order,
amounting to 416 trials in total. The experimental session lasted approximately 30 minutes.

Quantifying the psychometric function
To model Gabor orientation discrimination performance, cumulative logistic psychometric functions
(PFs) were fit to the data using a Maximum Likelihood criterion82. The dependent measure was the
proportion of trials on which the participant indicated that the Gabor appeared to be oriented
‘rightward’ and the independent measure was the true orientation of the Gabor. The logistic
function is described by the following:

The PF threshold and slope parameters were used to formally detect outliers in the dataset. Any
participant who met any one of the following two criteria for the overall PF fit to their entire dataset
was excluded from further analysis: 1) a threshold value over 3 median absolute deviations from the
overall group median and/or 2) a slope value over 3 median absolute deviations from the overall
group median. This led to a total of 6 participants being excluded and hence 37 participants were
entered into the final inferential analyses.

Quantifying perceptual choice history bias
In order to measure perceptual choice history bias, the data within each participant were split into
two bins: one containing trials that followed a leftward orientation response on the previous trial
(‘post left response’) and the other containing trials that followed a rightward orientation response
on the previous trial (‘post right response’). The PF was fit separately to data from these subsets of
trials (Fig. 2A). From the resulting fits, the threshold and slope were retrieved. This was done
separately for trial lags of +1, +2 and +3. The difference in PF threshold between ‘post left’ and ‘post
right’ responses indexes the strength and direction of perceptual choice history bias (Fig. 2B). If
positive choice history bias (i.e. tendency to repeat previous choices16-20) heavily influences the
orientation judgements then the group-averaged psychometric curves conditioned separately on
‘post left response’ and ‘post right response’ trials will be shifted horizontally on the



-axis in

relation to one another. To formally test this, a repeated-measures  -test was performed to
compare the PF thresholds between ‘post left response’ trials and ‘post right response’ trials. This
analysis was also performed separately for ‘post high confidence’ and ‘post low confidence’ trials
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1: see

SDT parameter analyses

section below for division of

confidence bins).

Quantifying metacognitive choice history bias
Measuring history bias of metacognitive decisions required a different analytical approach. If
positive metacognitive choice history bias occurs31 then confidence ratings will be more likely to be

high following a high confidence rating and low following a low confidence rating, regardless of the
level of external evidence (i.e. absolute Gabor orientation) (see Fig. 2C). To statistically test this,
linear regression was performed between absolute Gabor orientation and mean confidence ratings
separately for post 1, 2, 3 and 4 rating trials in each participant. Subsequently, linear regression was
then performed between the previous confidence rating (1, 2, 3, 4) and the intercepts of the
orientation-confidence regressions, and the resulting within-participant regression slope
represented our measure of history bias. At the group level, a one sample  -test (versus 0) was
performed on the resulting regression slopes to examine whether they were statistically different
from zero (i.e. whether they showed a systematic directionality across participants). This was done
separately for trial lags of +1, +2 and +3 (Fig. 2D). This analysis was also performed separately for
trials in which the previous perceptual choice (i.e. ‘left’ or ‘right’) was ‘repeated’ versus trials in
which the perceptual choice was ‘alternated’ (Fig 5A-B). A paired-samples t-test was used to
compare the regression slopes between ‘repetition’ and ‘alternation’ trials.

Quantifying choice history biases and estimating population prevalence using mutual
information (MI)
Mutual Information (MI)39 is a measure of statistical dependence between two random variables
that places no assumption on the form of the dependence. For two discrete variables

X and Y that

are distributed according to a joint probability distribution P(X,Y) the MI is defined as:

;  

  ,  log 

, 



,

When the probability distributions are estimated from observed data the resulting MI estimate
suffers from a limited sampling bias which causes the expectation of the estimate to be
systematically larger than the true value. We correct this by subtracting the Miller-Madow bias
estimate83, which is given by

| | | |

, where | |, | | are respectively the number of discrete

values taken by the variables X and Y, and

!trl

is the number of trials used for the calculation.

Statistical inference was performed via permutation testing. The relationship between X and Y was
shuffled and the resulting MI values stored. This was repeated 1000 times (separately for the each
participant). The 95th percentile of the resulting permutation value was used as the threshold for
inference on the MI value obtained from the unshuffled data.

We calculate the following MI values (Figure 2E): I(Orient; Resp), I(Resp-1; Resp), I(Orient; Conf),
I(Conf-1;Conf). In these calculations, the number of bins for the orientation is reduced by considering
neighbouring levels of evidence together (e.g. 7 discrete bins corresponding to the following
presented angles: [-18 -15] [-12 -9] [-6 -3] [0] [3 6] [9 12] [15 18]). Perceptual response is always
represented with two discrete values (left or right). Confidence was represented with 3 or 4 discrete
values (some participants never used one of the four confidence response values). For the choice
history calculations, the variable Resp-1/Conf-1 is given by all trials excluding the last, the variable
Resp/Conf is formed from all trials excluding the first.

Modelling perceptual and metacognitive sensitivity and bias
Computational models of perceptual decision-making and confidence judgements, grounded largely
in statistical decision theory and SDT, have successfully accounted for a range of confidence related
empirical data33,34,47,57. Here, we modelled perceptual decisions and confidence ratings within an
extended signal detection theory (SDT) framework5. This model assumes that, during yes/no
detection or 2-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) discrimination tasks, binary decisions are made by
the comparison of internal evidence (indexed by a noisy decision variable (dv)) with a decision
criterion (c). Across trials, evidence generated by each stimulus class (i.e. noise/signal, choice
A/choice B) is sampled from a stimulus-specific normal distribution. The relative separation between
the distributions (in standard deviation units) indexes the overall level of evidence available for the

decisions (d’), and hence how well the observer can discriminate between noise and signal, or
between choice A and choice B. On a given trial, the probability that the choice is correct is indexed
by the absolute distance between dv and c (in an unbiased observer), and hence statistically optimal
confidence judgements should reflect this computation34,47. When a discrete confidence rating scale
is employed, the rating on a given trial is defined by where the dv falls with respect to the so-called
‘type-2’ criteria (c2). The c2 are response conditional, with separate criteria for the 2 possible
choices (i.e. noise/signal, choice A/choice B). Overall, there are (k-1) x 2 c2, where k equals the
number of confidence ratings available. Figure 1B presents the model schematically for 3 differing
levels of decision evidence: no evidence (left panel), weak evidence (middle panel) and strong
evidence (right panel). The distributions and predicted effects in Figures 1B-E were produced using
code developed by Urai et al.,16 (https://github.com/anne-urai/pupilUncertainty). The x-axis ranges
from [-15:15] in these examples, d’ was set to 0.1 (no evidence), 1.58 (weak evidence) and 3.17
(strong evidence) whereas c was always set to 0 (unbiased observer). The flanking c2 were set at ±3
(conservative) and ±6 (liberal) for each. To formalise the predicted relationships between evidence
strength, accuracy and confidence (Fig. 1-E), we simulated a normal distribution of dv for one
response (i.e. μ>0) at each level of evidence strength. All samples from the simulated distribution
were split into correct and error ‘choices’ based on their position relative to c. For each combination
of evidence strength and choice, the level of confidence is

of decision confidence (with response times increasing as a function of decreasing confidence)16,34
the response time prediction (Fig. 1E) represents an inversion of the confidence prediction (Fig. 1D).
In order to quantify both type-1 and type-2 performance parameters (i.e. sensitivity and bias) across
different levels of evidence strength (absolute Gabor orientations) in the real data, we adopted the
meta-d’ approach (see

5,42,43

for extended description and discussion) as implemented using single-

subject Bayesian model fits within the ‘HMeta-d’ toolbox42 (https://github.com/metacoglab/HMetad). Meta-d’ characterises type-2 sensitivity as the value of d’ that a metacognitively optimal
observer, with the same type-1 response bias (c), would have required to produce the observed
type-2 (confidence) data5. If an observer has perfect metacognitive insight (i.e. they are always high
in confidence when correct and low in confidence when incorrect) then d’ will be equal to meta-d’.
Importantly, because meta-d’ is expressed in the same units as d’, the two can be compared directly
to quantify the level of metacognitive efficiency/insight. If the metacognitive efficiency score (meta-

d’-d’) ≠ 0, then the type-2 responses (confidence ratings) are either more (positive value) or less
(negative value) sensitive to the task-related evidence than the type-1 perceptual responses. We
note that (meta-d’/d’) is often used to quantify metacognitive efficiency as a ratio of type-1
performance58 and so we replicated our correlation analyses involving (meta-d’-d’) using (meta-

d’/d’) (see Supplementary Figure 4). The same pattern of results was found. The metacognitive
criteria (meta-c) represent type-2 bias (c2) calculated within the meta-d’ framework: the tendency
to give high or low confidence ratings regardless of evidence strength. We calculated the absolute
distance between meta-c and type-1 c (|meta-c - c|) in order to isolate the metacognitive response
bias from the perceptual response bias43. Lower values of |meta-c - c| indicate an overall response
bias in favour of higher confidence ratings. As mentioned, meta-c (c2) values are calculated
separately for each of the possible perceptual responses (i.e. ‘left’ or ‘right’ orientation judgements
in the current study) and for each of N-1 confidence ratings available to choose from (4 in the
current experiment). In order to streamline the analysis, we averaged over the 3 |meta-c - c| values

for each response (‘left’ or ‘right’) separately to gain a single estimate of overall metacognitive
response bias.

Statistical analyses on SDT parameters
We compared overall perceptual sensitivity (d’) to metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d’) across all
levels of evidence strength using a 2 (sensitivity measure: d’, meta-d’) x 6 (absolute Gabor
orientation: 3°,6°,9°,12°,15°,18°) repeated measures ANOVA. To assess the extent to which the type1 and type-2 SDT performance parameters were influenced by both perceptual and metacognitive
choice history, trials were binned in three different ways (1. ‘post left’/’post right’ choice trials (Fig.
3); 2. ‘post high’/’post low’ confidence trials (Fig. 4); 3. ‘repetition’/’alternation’ trials (Fig. 5)) and
the parameters (d’, meta-d’, meta-d’ – d’, c, |meta-c - c|:‘left’ responses, |meta-c - c|:’right’

responses) were calculated for both bins separately at each of the 6 levels of evidence strength.
Repeated measures ANOVAs (2 (choice history bin) x 6 (absolute Gabor orientation:
3°,6°,9°,12°,15°,18°)) were then performed separately for each parameter. Significant interaction
terms were followed up using paired samples t-tests of the difference between the choice history
bins separately at each level of evidence strength. To split the trials into relatively equal ‘post high’
and ‘post low’ confidence bins within each participant, the number of trials immediately following
each of the 4 confidence ratings (i.e. post ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’ ratings) was calculated and bins were
assigned that minimized the difference in trial number between the high and low bins (median
difference between bins = 69 trials (min = 7, max = 251)). This led to 10 participants having ‘low’ bin
= ‘1’, ‘2’ and ‘3’ ratings, ‘high’ bin = ‘4’ ratings, 14 participants (‘low’ bin = ‘1’ and ‘2’ ratings, ‘high’
bin = ‘3’ and ‘4’ ratings) and 13 participants (‘low’ bin = ‘1’ ratings, ‘high’ bin = ‘2’, ‘3’ and ‘4’ ratings).
Note that 4 participants were excluded from the analysis of the influence of previous confidence
level on perceptual choice history bias (Supplementary Fig. 1) because they had PF slope values over
3 median absolute deviations from the overall group median in at least one of the conditions here.

This was due to biased perceptual and/or confidence decisions leading to a small number of trials
being available for PF fitting after binning for these participants.
For all t-tests and correlations (see below), we calculated the Bayes Factor (BF10) obtained from
paired-samples Bayesian t-tests85 or correlation hypothesis tests86, with a prior following a Cauchy
distribution and a scale factor of 0.707. BF10 quantifies the evidence in favour of the null or
alternative hypotheses, where BF10 below 1/3 indicates evidence for the null hypothesis, above 3
indicates evidence for the alternative hypothesis and between 1/3 and 3 indicates that the evidence
is inconclusive (potentially due to a lack of statistical power)85.

Between-subject correlations
Both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for each of the betweensubject correlations of interest. Only Pearson’s r are shown in the corresponding figures.
