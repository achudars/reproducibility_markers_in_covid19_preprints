Abstract
The movements of cytoplasmic dynein on microtubule (MT) tracks is achieved by two-way

communication between the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) and the ATPase domain of

dynein via an a-helical coiled-coil stalk, but the structural basis of this communication remains

elusive. Here, we regulated MTBD either in high-affinity or low-affinity states by introducing a

disulfide bond between the coiled-coils and analyzed the resulting structures by NMRand cryo-EM.

In the MT-unbound state, the affinity changes of MTBD were achieved by sliding of the N-terminal
α-helix by one half-turn, which suggests that structural changes propagate from the ATPase-domain
to MTBD. In addition, cryo-EM analysis showed that MT binding induced further sliding of the
N-terminal α-helix even without the disulfide bond, which suggests the MT-induced conformational
changes propagate toward the ATPase domain. Based on differences in the MT-binding surface

between the high- and low-affinity states, we propose a potential mechanism for the directional bias

of dynein movement on MT tracks.

Introduction
Cytoplasmic dynein is a motor protein that utilizes the energy of ATP to move along microtubules
(MTs) toward minus ends1,2. Cytoplasmic dynein is involved in many cellular processes, including

spindle formation in mitosis and the intracellular transportation of various cargo molecules. As a
result, mutations that affect dynein function have been implicated in various neurological diseases3.
Within the 1.4-MDa complex that constitutes the dynein machinery4, the heavy chain plays a central

role in dynein motility. The heavy chain forms a dimer through its N-terminal tail region, which also

mediates attachment to various cargo molecules. The C-terminal two-thirds of the heavy chain is

called the motor domain, based on the observation that the artificially dimerized motor domain is
sufficient for processive movement along MTs5. The motor domain has three structural elements: (1)

the ATPase domain, composed of the six conserved AAA+ modules (ATPase associated with diverse

cellular activities: AAA1 to AAA6) that form an asymmetric ring-shaped ATPase domain; (2) the

linker domain, which transmits the powerstroke movement to the N-terminal tail region; and (3) the

stalk region, a 15-nm-long anti-parallel coiled-coil structure that extends from the AAA4 module and

contains the microtubule binding domain (MTBD) at the tip of the stalk. In addition, another
coiled-coil structure, called the strut6 or buttress7, extends from the AAA5 module and forms a

Y-shaped structure together with the stalk coiled-coil (Fig. 1a).
Based on the crystal structures8–10 and EM images11,12 of the motor domain in different

nucleotide-binding states, the mechanochemical cycle of the dynein motor is explained as

follows13,14. (1) In the absence of the nucleotide, the motor domain is tightly bound to the MT. (2)

ATP binding to the motor domain induces rapid dissociation from the MT, followed by the

remodeling of the linker domain from straight to bent conformation (recovery stroke). (3) The motor

domain searches for a new binding site on the MT, via a weak interaction mode in either the ATP or

ADP/Pi state. (4) The phosphate release induces strong binding to the MT, and the linker

conformation reverts from bent to straight form in the MT-bound state to transmit the powerstroke.

(5) Finally, the motor domain returns to the initial state by the release of ADP from the AAA1

module.

Since the proposed model is based primarily on “snapshots” of the motor domain in the

different nucleotide states in the absence of MTs, the temporal sequence of conformational changes

within the large motor domain remains speculative. In particular, it is unclear how the events in the

ATPase domain (ATP hydrolysis, Pi release, and power stroke) are coupled with MT binding by

MTBD. The nucleotide-binding state in AAA1, especially ATP hydrolysis and the release of Pi, is
critical for regulating MTBD from a low-affinity state to a high-affinity state15,16. On the other hand,
it is known that MT binding accelerates the ATPase activity of the AAA1 site17. Therefore, it is

unclear whether ATP hydrolysis/Pi release in the ATPase domain precedes or follows MT binding by

MTBD.

Furthermore, the structural mechanism of the two-way communication between the

ATPase domain and MTBD remains elusive. It has been proposed that the switching of the MT

affinity of MTBD is achieved by changes in the association mode of the coiled-coil, referred to as

“registry”. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the sliding of CC1 with respect to CC2 by
one-turn of an α−helix results in a distinctive change in the affinity for MTs18,19. Comparison of the
crystal structures of the motor domain in the ADP/Vi-20 and ADP8-bound states have indicated that

the change in the registry is caused by an altered interaction between the stalk and strut/buttress.

However, the atomic detail of the affinity switching, especially regarding how the helix sliding near

the ATPase domain is transmitted to MTBD, remains elusive. Currently available crystal or NMR
structures that include MTBD moiety20–23 mostly represent the low-affinity conformation, even for

the full-length motor domain of Dictyostelium discoideum cytoplasmic dynein in the ADP-bound
state8, which would reflect the high-affinity state for MTs based on the biochemical observation. The
cryo-EM-based atomic model of MT-bound MTBD in the high-affinity binding state24,25 was used to

infer that the conformational changes of the N-terminal H1 helix are essential for high-affinity

binding. However, the detailed structure of the high-affinity state remains poorly defined due to the

low resolution of the cryo-EM map.

Additionally, it is unknown why the movement of the dynein motor along MTs is biased

toward the minus-end direction. In contrast to kinesin and myosin motors, the two motor domains of

cytoplasmic dynein are less coordinated; one motor domain is allowed to move either forward or

backward with various step sizes, but the overall movement of dynein is stochastically biased in the
forward direction5. To understand the directional preference in dynein movement, it is necessary to

elucidate the binding mode of MTBD when dynein searches for a new binding site with the

low-affinity state, as well as when dynein forms a final complex with the high-affinity state.

In the present study, we exploited disulfide cross-linking to regulate MTBD either in the

high- or low-affinity state. We determined the NMR structures of MTBD in the low- and

high-affinity states, and obtained high-resolution cryo-EM structures of MT-bound MTBD with or

without pre-stabilization in the high-affinity state by introduction of a disulfide bond. Furthermore,

the difference in the MT interaction sites between MTBD in the low- and high-affinity states was

revealed by NMR. Those data clarified the structural changes of MTBD, explaining the affinity

regulation and the two-way communication mechanism of cytoplasmic dynein, and suggested a

structural mechanism for the directional preference of dynein on MT tracks.

Results
Construct design of MTBDs stabilized in the low-affinity and high-affinity states
We generated a construct encoding a 137-residue fragment of the yeast cytoplasmic dynein; the

corresponding protein contains the entire microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) and the part of the
coiled-coil (Fig. 1a), as shown in a previous NMR study of mouse cytoplasmic dynein22,26. The

protein (termed MTBD-WT) encoded by this construct was expressed in E. coli and purified to

homogeneity.

To stabilize the conformation of MTBD in the specific MT-binding state, we introduced a

disulfide bond between CC1 and CC2 to lock the registries. To stabilize MTBD in the low-affinity

state, the construct was mutated such that the codons encoding S3097 in CC1 and V3222 in CC2

were mutated to instead encode cysteines. The corresponding protein residues are in close proximity

(distance between Cβ atoms: 5.7 Å) according to the crystal structure of mouse MTBD in the
low-affinity state21 (Fig. 1a and 1b). To stabilize MTBD in the high-affinity state, the codon for

I3101 (instead of S3097) was mutated to instead encode cysteine, in combination with the V3222C
mutation in CC2. The targeting of I1301, which is located one α-helical turn downstream of S3097,
was based on previous biochemical studies17 (Fig. 1a and b). The intramolecular disulfide bond

formation in each of the two mutant proteins was confirmed by mobility shifts of the proteins when

separated by SDS-PAGE analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and by the appearance of a single set of

peaks in the HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence) spectra (Fig. 1f).

Nishida et al.

To examine whether those mutant proteins indeed are stabilized in low- and high-affinity

states, we performed co-sedimentation assays. While the dissociation constant (Kd) of MTBD-WT
was estimated to be 6.7 μM (Fig. 1c), MTBD (S3097C/V3222C) exhibited significantly lower MT
affinity (Kd > 200 μM) (Fig. 1d), indicating that the disulfide bond formation stabilized MTBD
conformation in a low-affinity state. On the other hand, the Kd of MTBD (I3101C/V3222C) was 4.8
μM (Fig. 1e), a value that was much smaller than that of the S3097C/V322C mutant and slightly
smaller than that of MTBD-WT. This result indicated that the I3101C/V3222C disulfide bond locked

MTBD in a stronger-binding state. Hereafter, we refer to MTBD(S3097C/V3222C) and

MTBD(I3101C/V3222C) mutants as MTBD-Low and MTBD-High, respectively.

Structural differences of MTBD in the low- and high-affinity states
To gain structural insights into the affinity switching mechanism of MTBD, we derived the solution

structures of MTBD-High and MTBD-Low using the standard NMR-derived distance restraints
(Supplementary Fig. 1b and c). Both MTBD-High and MTBD-Low were composed of six α-helices
(H1 to H6) and an anti-parallel coiled-coil (CC1 and CC2, Fig. 2). The coiled-coil registry of
CC1-CC2 in MTBD-Low was similar to the registry of mouse MTBD in the low-affinity states21,

corresponding to the +β-registry (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, MTBD-High showed a distinctive
slide of the CC1 helix with respect to CC2 by an α-helical half-turn, accompanied by the downward

Nishida et al.

shift of H1 with respect to H3 (Fig. 2b). We refer to the registry of MTBD-High as “semi-α”, since
the sliding of CC1 places that helix in an intermediate position between the +β- and α-registries. We
compared the overall structures of MTBD-High and MTBD-Low with the existing MTBD atomic
models in the low-affinity states8,10,21,23. Although the construct design and the source species of

dynein were different, all previous structures showed H1 and CC1 in positions similar to those seen

in MTBD-Low (Supplementary Fig. 1e), indicating that the conformational changes of H1 and CC1

from MTBD-Low to MTBD-High are related to the increase in MT affinity. In addition, the HSQC

spectrum of MTBD-WT indicated that signals originating from the residues in CC1 and CC2 were

located between MTBD-High and MTBD-Low (Fig. 1f), implying that MTBD without the disulfide

bond is in an equilibrium between the +β and semi-α registries, and suggesting that the population

shift toward the semi-α registry correlates with the increase in MT-binding affinity.

Cryo-EM structure and modeling of the MTBD-MT complex
To elucidate the structural basis of the MT binding of MTBD, we performed cryo-EM single-particle

reconstruction of MTBD-High in complex with MTs (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 2). We

also analyzed the complex in the presence of DTT (dithiothreitol) to examine whether the disulfide

bond formation in the coiled-coil affected the MTBD structure in the MT-bound state. Without

imposing pseudo-helical symmetry on MT, the structures (including the seam) were well resolved,

with a density corresponding to MTBD seen at the intradimer boundary of αβ-tubulin (Fig. 3b-g).
Using a cut-off of 0.143 for the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSCtrue, see Methods for detail), the overall
resolution for each map was estimated to be 3.94 Å and 3.66 Å in the absence (-) and presence (+) of

DTT (hereafter referred as +/- DTT), respectively (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 2).

Since the local resolution of the cryo-EM density of MTBD is ~4-5 Å (Fig. 3f and g),

which is not sufficient for constructing the de novo atomic model, we built an atomic model

structure of the MTBD-High-MT complexes by a flexible-fitting method. The atomic models of

tubulin dimer (PDB code: 1JFF) and NMR-derived MTBD-High were fit into the map, and
subjected to flexible fitting using MDFF and energy minimization27 (Supplementary Fig. 3a and b).

In both the +/- DTT complex structures, all helices of MTBD were well accommodated within the

maps (Supplementary Fig. 3c and d). Three trials of the flexible docking resulted in similar MTBD

atomic models; we selected the model with the highest cross-correlation coefficient. Although the

density corresponding to the CC1 region was relatively weak, the CC1 helix was well fit into the

map for both DTT conditions (Fig. 2e and f, Supplementary Fig. 3c and d). Interestingly, we found

that the DTT(-) and DTT(+) structures were very similar to each other (Fig. 2c), suggesting that MT

binding, not the disulfide bond, determines the MT-bound MTBD-High structure. In addition, the

good agreement of cryo-EM density corresponding to the hydrophobic interactions between CC1

and CC2 (Fig. 2e and f, asterisks) in both conditions suggests the similarity of the two structures and

Nishida et al.

the validity of fitting. Therefore, in the following, we mainly used the atomic model of the

MTBD-High in complex with MT in the presence of DTT, which we refer to as MTBD-Bound.

To examine the structural changes of MTBD caused by MT binding, we compared the

structures of the MTBD-High, MTBD-Low, and the MTBD-Bound models (Fig. 2d). The

MTBD-Bound model exhibited prominent conformational changes at CC1 and H1 region, compared

to MTBD-Low and MTBD-High. Notably, CC1 of MTBD-Bound was positioned further toward the

N-terminus compared to MTBD-High (corresponding to semi-α-registry), resulting in a one-turn
α-helical shift in registry from MTBD-Low (corresponding to +β-registry), i.e. converting the
structure into an α-registry (Fig. 2d). Therefore, MTBD in the α-registry is likely stabilized upon
MT binding, presumably by an induced-fit mechanism.

Residues involved in interactions between MTs and MTBD
Next, we investigated the residues involved in high-affinity binding in the MTBD-MT complex.

Overall, the MT-binding surface of MTBD is rich in positively charged residues, while the

MTBD-binding surface of MTs is occupied predominantly by negatively charged residues. MTBD
binds to α- and β-tubulin via the H1, H3, and H6 helices (Fig. 4a), forming six pairs of salt bridges,
as summarized in Table 1. On the α-tubulin side, R402(α) forms a salt bridge with H1’s E3122, the
sole negatively charged residue of the MT-binding surface on MTBD (Fig. 4b). E415(α), which

Nishida et al.

forms an intramolecular salt bridge with R402(α) in the original tubulin dimer structure, engages in

an intermolecular salt bridge with R3201 on H6, together with E420(α) (Fig. 4b). These
charge-flipped interactions also were observed in the cryo-EM model of MTBD of Dictyostelium
dynein.25 On the β-tubulin side, D427(β) and E199(β) form a salt bridge with K3117 and R3124 on
H1, respectively (Fig. 3c). In addition, E159(β) and D163(β) form a salt bridge with R3159 and
R3152 on H3, respectively (Fig. 3d). Therefore, our results suggested that the high-affinity state of

MTBD-High is achieved by formation of multiple salt bridges between MTBD and MTs on the

complementarily shaped surface.

To validate our high-affinity model, we performed mutational analysis of the positively

residues hypothesized to be involved in the salt bridge in the complex to non-charged residues

(either Ala or Met). [Indeed, mutation of each of these residues resulted in greater than 2-fold

decrease in MT affinity (Supplementary Fig. 4). Notably, mutation of K3116 or of K3204, both of

which are located near the MT-binding site but are not thought to be directly involved in the

interactions, yielded MTBD-High proteins with MT affinities similar to that of the original

MTBD-High protein.

Structural basis of affinity switching
Next, we explored the affinity switching mechanism between MTBD in the low-affinity and

high-affinity states using NMR. Since cryo-EM analysis of MTBD-Low in complex with MTs was

Nishida et al.

unsuccessful (presumably due to MTBD-Low’s weak affinity for MTs), we investigated the

difference in the MT-binding surface of MTBD-Low and MTBD-High using the transferred
cross-saturation (TCS) method28. The TCS method allowed us to identify the MT-contacting surface

of MTBD by observing the saturation transfer from MT to MTBD as intensity reductions in the

NMR signals. In TCS experiments using MTBD-High, the residues in H1, H3, and the loop near H6

exhibited greater signal intensity reductions compared to other residues (Fig. 5a and c). Note that all

three of these helices also were located at the interface between MTBD and MT in our

cryo-EM-based models (Fig. 5d). On the other hand, the TCS experiments with MTBD-Low showed

greater intensity reduction for only one residue in H3, while the signals from the similar residues in

H1 and the loop near H6 were reduced (Fig. 5b and e). These results indicated that H3 makes a

greater contribution in the affinity switching of MTBD.

Discussion
Three major structural states of dynein MTBD
In the present study, we used a combination of structural methods to demonstrate that dynein MTBD
can assume three major states, namely the +β, semi-α, and α-registries (Fig. 6a and Supplementary
Video 1), which may explain the affinity switching mechanism of MTBD. In MTBD-Low, MTBD

adopts a +β-registry, with the H1 and H6 regions forming a weak-binding surface for MTs (Fig. 6a,

left); in MTBD-High, MTBD adopts a semi-α-registry with sliding of CC1 by a half-turn of the

Nishida et al.

α-helix, with the H1, H3, and H6 regions forming a strong-binding surface (Fig. 6a, middle). In the
MT-bound state, MTBD undergoes a further conformational change to assume the α-registry by
sliding of one-turn of an α-helix in total (Fig. 6a, right).

Comparison with existing MTBD-MT complex structures
To see whether the structural changes of the MTBD-MT complex are shared among species, we
compared our model with those proposed in previous reports (Supplementary Fig. 5a-c)24,25,29.
Among the existing studies, a recent report by Lacey et al.29 showed MTBD structures of mouse

cytoplasmic dynein and human axonemal dynein resolved to resolutions (4.1 and 4.5 Å,

respectively) similar to ours. These two structures showed better agreement with our model than
with other models proposed by Uchimura et al.25 and Redwine et al.24 (Supplementary Fig. 5e).

Therefore, we compare our structures primarily with those proposed by Lacey et al.

In addition, the two structures of Lacey et al., as similar to the present study, exhibited

significant displacement of H1 and sliding of the CC1 helix, corresponding to a one-turn slide of the
CC1 α-helix with respect to CC2 (Supplementary Fig. 5d), a point that was not clearly mentioned in
Lacey et al. due to the lower resolution of the MTBD moiety (5-7 Å) in their work compared to our

structure (4-5 Å). Although their MTBD structure is pre-stabilized in the high-affinity state using an

SRS (Seryl-tRNA synthetase)-chimera construct, our results demonstrated that the conformations of

Nishida et al.

MTBD in complex with MT are similar regardless of high-affinity restraints (i.e., with or without

DTT treatment), indicating that MT binding induces the sliding of CC1. As revealed by our TCS

experiments, H3 plays a significant role in the high-affinity binding, contributing to the formation of

two salt bridges (between R3152 and E159(β), and between R3159 and D163(β) (Fig. 5c). In the
Lacey model, two conserved positively charged residues, R3334 (equivalent to R3152) and R3342

(equivalent to R3159), are positioned close enough to form salt bridges with negatively charged
residues of β-tubulin (Supplementary Fig. 6a and b). On the other hand, these positively charged H3
residues are not conserved in MTBD of the Dictyostelium dynein (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Instead,

K3424 and R3423, which are positioned in the middle of the H3 helix, could serve as alternative salt

bridge partners. Indeed, K3424 formed a salt bridge with E159(β) (Supplementary Fig. 6c), and
reorienting of the side chain of R3423 enables formation of a salt bridge with

D163(β) (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Therefore, it appears that the two salt bridges formed on H3 are
also universally conserved, participating in high-affinity binding by dynein molecules of multiple

species.

A model of the mechanochemical cycle of dynein
Based on the modeled conformational changes of MTBD in the absence and presence of MTs in the

present study, we propose that the mechanochemical cycle of dynein proceeds via two distinctive

Nishida et al.

pathways, namely an “ATPase-driven pathway” and a “MT-binding-induced pathway”. In the

ATP-bound states, the stalk coiled-coil adopts the +β registry across the entire region, and MTBD is
stabilized in the low-affinity state (Fig. 6b (3)). In the ATPase-driven pathway (Fig. 6b; shown in

light green), ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 6b (4-1) and subsequent release of Pi induces conformational

changes of the ATPase domain, which alters the interaction mode between the stalk and strut
coiled-coils to induce the release of the stalk coiled-coil association mode from the +β-registry 8,30.
The perturbation of coiled-coil packing induces conformational equilibrium between low-affinity

(+β) and high-affinity (semi-α) states, thereby increasing the MT-binding affinity of MTBD as
MTBD searches for a new MT binding site (Fig. 6b (4-2)). The complex formation with MTs
stabilizes the conformation of MTBD in the α-registry, a change that is propagated through the
entire coiled-coil helix toward the ATPase domain (Fig. 6b (4-3)). Consequently, further

conformational rearrangements in the ATPase domain induce the powerstroke of the linker (Fig. 6b

(5)) and the release of ADP (Fig. 6b (1)). In the MT-binding-induced pathway, the conformational
changes of MTBD are directly induced from +β to α-registry by MT binding (Fig. 6b (4’)). As a
result, the conformational changes are transmitted toward the ATPase domain to facilitate ATP

hydrolysis, release of Pi, and the powerstroke of the linker, all as a consequence of MT binding (Fig.

6b; highlighted in pink). This alternative pathway explains why ATPase activity is enhanced in the

presence of MTs. Therefore, we propose that the three conformational states of MTBD mediate the

Nishida et al.

two-way communication between MTBD and the ATPase domain via either

ATP-hydrolysis-dependent or MT-binding-driven pathways.

A model of biased movement of dynein
Our result also may provide a clue to the mechanism of the biased movement of dynein

along MTs. It is known that the movement of the dynein motor along MTs is biased in the forward
(i.e., minus-end) direction5, and dyneins on MTs exhibit stronger resistance to backward (i.e.,
plus-end) force than to forward force31. We propose that the force-direction-dependent binding of

dynein can be explained as follows: MTBD in the weak-binding state provides initial attachment to

MTs via H1 and H6, while the interaction mediated by H3 has not formed yet (Fig. 7a). When force

is applied in the backward direction, the stalk would tilt backward, thereby pushing H3 toward
β-tubulin (Fig. 7b), which would be preferable for high-affinity binding (Fig. 7c). In two-headed
motor domain stepping, the leading head of dimeric dynein in the ATP-bound (low-affinity) state

searches for a new binding site, while the lagging head in the ADP or apo (high-affinity) state

remains attached to the MT. The angle between the stalk of the leading head and the MT would

become smaller when the leading head steps forward, than when that head steps backward.

Therefore, for the same reason as when the backward force is applied, the forward movement would

be favored over the backward. EM studies indicate that the dynein stalk in the MT-bound state tilts

backward, with an angle of ~42º32. A recent study showed that the reverse kink mutant, which moves

in the opposite direction, still possesses resistance to the minus-end force (i.e., as with the regular
dynein motor) 33, further supporting the binding mode of low-affinity MTBD and confirming that its

interface geometry with respect to MTs is crucial for generating the directional preference of dynein

motility.

Methods
Protein preparation and characterization
The MTBD construct encoding residues K3096-E3232 of the cytoplasmic dynein of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae was expressed and the resulting protein purified as described previously34.

Co-sedimentation assay
Porcine tubulin was polymerized in PEMG buffer (100 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM GTP) supplemented with 5% DMSO for 30 min at 37 oC, and stabilized by addition of

10 μM paclitaxel. Purified MTBDs (1-32 μM) were mixed with 5 μM porcine microtubules (MTs) in
the binding buffer (100 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA), and
centrifuged at 210,000 x g, 25 ºC, 10 min, using an Optima MAX equipped with an MLA80 rotor
(Beckman Coulter). The pellet was rinsed once with 50 μL of the binding buffer, and then subjected
to SDS-PAGE. The bands were analyzed by ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) for

densitometric analysis. The dissociation constants (Kd) were obtained by one-site curve-fitting

analysis using Origin 5.0 (Microcal Software).

NMR analysis and structure determination
All NMR experiments were performed using an AVANCE 800 or AVANCE 500 spectrometer

equipped with TCI cryogenic probe (Bruker Biospin) at 25 ºC. The backbone and side-chain
assignments of MTBD-High and MTBD-Low were performed as described previously34.
Inter-proton distance information was obtained from the 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC and 15N-edited

NOESY-HSQC spectra. The mixing time was 100 ms for all NOESY experiments. A series of
1

H-15N HSQC spectra was acquired on a sample freshly dissolved in D2O, to obtain a backbone

hydrogen-bonding amide group. In addition, dihedral angle constraints based on HNHA35 and
TALOS+36 were used. The 1H-15N residual dipolar coupling constants were collected using
15

N-labeled MTBD in the presence of 8 mg/mL of pf1 phage and 4.2% C12E5/n-hexanol bicelle

(0.96:0.04) using IPAP (in-phase anti-phase) HSQC experiments37. The structure calculation was
initially performed by Cyana2.1 using the above distance constraints without RDC information38.
The final structure ensemble was calculated by Xplor-NIH39, including the RDC constraints and

Cyana-assisted NOE assignments; the distance constraints are summarized in Table I. The 10 lowest

energy structures were selected as a final ensemble.

Transferred cross-saturation (TCS) experiments
2

H-, 15N-labeled MTBD was mixed with polymerized MT at a 10:1 ratio in the NMR buffer (10 mM

NaPi, pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, 80% D2O). The TCS experiments were performed using an AVANCE
800 NMR spectrometer equipped with cryogenic TCI probe, employing the pulse program as
described previously28. A pair of HSQC spectra was collected with and without radio frequency

irradiation at 1.00 ppm for 0.5 sec at the end of the recycling delay period (total duration, 4.0 sec)

using the I-BURP2 pulse scheme (maximum B1 amplitude 0.5 kHz). The intensity ratios of each

peak in the two HSQC spectra were analyzed by SPARKY software (UCSF).

Cryo-EM sample preparation of MTBD-High-MT complex
For cryo-EM observation, GMPCPP-MT was polymerized by mixing 0.18 mg/ml of

GMPCPP-tubulin in PEM/NP40 buffer (80 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.01%
NP40) and incubating for 30 minutes at 37 °C. For MTBD-High-MT complex, 3 μL of the

Nishida et al.

GMPCPP-MT solution was applied to a glow-discharged, carbon-coated grid (Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3)

inside a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 30 seconds at 22 °C and 100%
humidity. The grid was washed once with 3 μL of MTBD solution and once with 3 μL of PEM/NP40
buffer (30-second incubation each), followed by blotting and vitrifying in liquid ethane. To observe

the reduced form of MTBD in complex with MTs, 0.4 mg/ml GMPCPP-tubulin and 0.8 mg/ml

MTBD-High were mixed in PEM/NP40 buffer supplemented with DTT to a final concentration of 1

mM. The mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C to co-polymerize reduced MTBD with
GMPCPP-tubulin. An aliquot of 2 μL of the specimen was applied to a glow-discharged,
carbon-coated grid (Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3) inside a Vitrobot set at 6 °C and 100% humidity and

incubated for 10 seconds before blotting and vitrifying in liquid ethane.

Cryo-EM data collection for MTBD-High-MT complex
A large cryo-EM dataset of the MTBD-High-decorated GMPCPP-MT in the absence (-) or presence

(+) of DTT was collected on a 200-KeV Talos Arctica electron microscope (Thermo Fisher

Scientific). A Gatan Image Filter (GIF) was used for data collection, with a slit width of 30 eV.
Defocus ranging from -1.0 to -2.5 μm was used. A total of 1820 and 621 movie stacks for the DTT(-)
and DTT(+) conditions, respectively, were recorded on a post-GIF K2 Summit camera (Gatan) in

counting mode with a calibrated pixel size of 1.32 Å per physical pixel and a dose-rate of ~10

electrons/pixel/s. Each exposure was 10 seconds long and recorded as a movie of 40 frames,
corresponding to a dose of 1.35 e/Å 2 for each frame, and a cumulative dose of 54.0 e/Å2 on the
specimen. The data were collected semi-automatically using SerialEM40.

Image processing
For the collected data, drift correction was performed using MotionCor241. The contrast transfer
function parameters were estimated from the motion-corrected micrographs using Gctf42. In the next

step, we used PyFilamentPicker (manuscript in preparation) to semi-automatically select 14-PF MTs

and to cut each MT into overlapping boxes with an 82-Å non-overlapping region along the MT axis
between adjacent boxes (Supplementary Table 1). We used a “super-particle”-based approach43 to

determine the correct seam location for each particle. The seam-finding process was repeated several

times to ensure accurate seam determination (Supplementary Fig. 2). During the iteration, “bad”

MTs (that is, those whose seam location was not determined consistently) were removed

(Supplementary Table 1). After several cycles, we calculated C1 reconstruction and confirmed

whether the seam could be clearly seen, meaning seam locations for the majority of particles were

correctly determined (Fig. 3d and e). We used relion_postprocess in RELION-3 package1 for

estimating final resolution and B-factor for map sharpening. The resolution was estimated by

calculating the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSCt) of one “good” protofilament segment containing

three central adjacent tubulins from two half-maps reconstructed from randomly separated particles
using FREALIGN (Symmetry: HP)44 (Supplementary Table 2). As a last step, we calculated FSCtrue
by additionally calculating FSCn, FSC for the high-resolution noise (< 10 Å) -substituted stack (Fig.
3a, Supplementary Table 2)45. FSCtrue was evaluated as follows (Eq. 1).

The final resolution for the reconstructed maps was determined using an FSC 0.143 criterion for

FSCtrue. There were no significant gaps in resolution between the resolutions evaluated using FSCt
and FSCtrue. The local resolution was calculated and the estimated B-factor was applied for
visualization using relion_postprocess (Fig. 3f and g).

Molecular dynamic by flexible fitting
The density map containing a single unit of tubulin dimer/MTBD complex was extracted from the

original map using the e2proc3d.py program in EMAN2. The atomic structure of the tubulin dimer

(PDB code: 1JFF) was fitted into the segmented map using UCSF chimera 1.10, and the NMR

structure of MTBD-High was placed manually in the initial model. The molecular dynamics flexible

fitting (MDFF) was performed following the tutorial provided by the developer using the explicit

solvent mode. Briefly, the initial atomic model was solvated and ionized by VMD software for

MDFF simulation in the explicit solvent. The MDFF simulation was performed using the software

NAMD 2.1, for 100,000 steps using a force-scaling factor (ξ) of 1.0 kcal/mol for both +/- DTT
cryo-EM maps, in the presence of secondary structure restraints and restraints to prevent cis/trans

peptide transitions and chirality errors. Following the MDFF simulation, a simple energy
minimization was performed, for 10,000 steps using a force-scaling factor (ξ) of 10.0 kcal for both
maps. It should be noted that the side-chain orientations of R402(α) and E415(β), which form an
intramolecular salt bridge in the original tubulin dimer coordinates (1JFF), was manipulated by

PyMOL so that the side-chains are exposed to the solvent to enable the formation of intermolecular

salt bridges. The trajectory of the MDFF simulation was analyzed by VMD, to calculate the

cross-correlation coefficient (CCC) between the target density map and each frame of the MDFF

simulation. The CCC was improved from 0.60 to 0.67 for the DTT(-) structure and from 0.58 to 0.67

for the DTT(+) structure, at which point the CCC reached a plateau.

(a) The three conformational states of MTBD revealed in this study. In the MT-unbound state,

MTBD undergoes conformational equilibrium between MTBD-Low (left, +β registry) and

MTBD-High (middle, semi-α registry). MT binding induces conformational changes of MTBD with

sliding of CC1 (α registry). (b) Mechanochemical cycles of dynein. In the ATPase-driven pathway
(green), the hydrolysis of ATP (3 to 4-1) and subsequent release of Pi (4-1 to 4-2) shift the
equilibrium of MTBD toward semi-α state (4-2) to increase the MT-binding affinity. After MT
binding, the stabilized α-registry transmits the conformational changes to ATPase domain, thereby
facilitating the powerstroke movements of the linker (4-3 to 5). In the MT-binding-induced pathway

(pink), the ATP-bound dynein searches for a new binding site in the low-affinity state. Upon MT
binding, the stabilization of the α-registry transmits the conformational changes to the ATPase
domain, which facilitates ATP hydrolysis, Pi release, and the powerstroke all at once.
