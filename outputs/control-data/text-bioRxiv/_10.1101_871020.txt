ABSTRACT

34

In the Baltic Sea, the dinoflagellates Apocalathium malmogiense, Biecheleria baltica, and

35

Gymnodinium corollarium are important contributors to the spring bloom. However, their relative

36

contribution to the bloom community cannot be unambiguously determined by conventional light

37

microscopy due to lack of resolution of distinctive morphological features of the three species.

38

Here, we describe a molecular approach based on a quantitative real-time polymerase chain

39

reaction (qPCR) primer and probe system, targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions of the rRNA gene

40

for all three species and enabling their quantification. The specificity of the method was

41

demonstrated using monocultures of A. malmogiense, B. baltica, G. corollarium as well as three

42

other dinoflagellate species co-occurring in the Baltic Sea during spring and validated using field-

43

collected phytoplankton samples.

INTRODUCTION

47

Dinoflagellates are arguably the largest group of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton aside from

48

diatoms, and one of the most important primary producers in the marine ecosystem. Cold-water

49

dinoflagellates are an important component of the algal spring bloom in the Baltic Sea (Lignell et

50

al. 1993; Tallberg and Heiskanen 1998). During the last four decades, their proportion has

51

increased significantly in some regions, and dinoflagellates now frequently dominate the spring

52

bloom in the central and northern basins of the Baltic Sea (Klais et al. 2011; Spilling et al. 2018).

53

Recent morphological and molecular analyses revealed that in addition to the chain-forming arctic

54

Peridiniella catenata, at least three other species are associated with the spring dinoflagellate

55

blooms in the Baltic (Larsen et al. 1995; Kremp et al. 2005; Sundström et al. 2009). The re-

56

described Biecheleria baltica Moestrup, Lindberg et Daugbjerg, formerly known as Woloszynskia

57

halophila (sensu Kremp et al., 2005) is common in the Gulf of Finland, co-occurring with

58

Apocalathium malmogiense (G. Sjöstedt) Craveiro, Daugbjerg, Moestrup & Calado, formerly

59

known as Scrippsiella hangoei (sensu Larsen et al., 1995) (Craveiro et al. 2017). The third species,

60

Gymnodinium corollarium Sundström, Kremp et Daugbjerg (Sundström et al. 2009), occurs

61

throughout the Baltic Sea and is particularly abundant in the open Baltic proper (Sundström et al.

62

2009).

63

Due to similar morphology, these species cannot be unambiguously distinguished from one another

64

by light microscopy with or without staining, particularly in samples preserved with Lugol iodine

65

solution (Kremp et al. 2005; Sundström et al. 2009). Unlike B. baltica and G. corollarium, A.

66

malmogiense is armored; therefore, staining with CalcoFluor White could be applied to visualize

67

the thecal plate patterns (Fritz and Triemer 1985). However, the thecal plates in this species are

68

delicate and stain poorly, thus hampering the identification (Larsen et al. 1995). Cell surface

69

features specific for unarmored B. baltica or G. corollarium can only be observed using scanning

70

electron microscopy (SEM), a method not applicable for quantitative enumeration of algae in field

71

plankton samples.

72

The difficulties with species identification are hampering our ability to study population dynamics

73

of the individual dinoflagellate species and, thus, understand the seasonal succession of these

74

ecologically important Baltic phytoplankton species. To understand whether phenology and bloom

75

magnitude are driven by life-history traits and environmental factors involved in the life cycle

76

regulation in A. malmogiense, B. baltica, and G. corollarium (Kremp et al. 2005), we need to

77

distinguish these species during the analysis. Furthermore, variations in the relative contribution of

78

these species to the spring bloom may affect their grazers. For example, interspecific differences

79

in allocation of fatty acids (Leblond et al. 2006) may lead to higher egg production in copepods fed

80

G. corollarium (Vehmaa et al. 2012) with consequences for energy transfer efficiency in the food

81

web. Finally, species-specific encystment strategies might influence biogeochemical processes in

82

the sediment once the bloom has settled out from the water column (Spilling and Lindström 2008);

83

to study all these ecological processes, we need reliable methods for population analysis of these

84

cold-water dinoflagellates co-occurring in the Baltic Sea.

85

In recent years, various molecular assays have been developed for the detection of several

86

phytoplankton species, improving the detection capacity and reducing sample processing time.

87

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays targeting ribosomal RNA (rRNA) encoding

88

gene (rRNA operon) have become a popular tool for species identification and quantification in

89

environmental samples of dinoflagellates (Bowers et al. 2000; Galluzzi et al. 2004; Dyhrman et al.

90

2006), particularly toxin-producing species with high capacity to outbreaks (Toebe et al. 2013;

91

Smith et al. 2014; Kon et al. 2015; Hernández-Becerril et al. 2018; Engesmo et al. 2018; Ruvindy

92

et al. 2018). In addition to high taxonomic resolution, these assays also have a sensitivity surpassing

93

that of the microscopy-based techniques. For example, an assay developed for Gymnodinium

94

catenatum estimated cell densities in environmental samples being as low as 0.07 cells per PCR

95

reaction or three cells per liter and detected the presence of cells below the limit of detection for

96

light microscopy (Toebe et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2014). Several types of real-time PCR assays with

97

differing levels of specificity have been developed, and positive reactions are detected either with

98

a fluorescent reporter probe (e.g., hydrolysis probes, molecular beacons, locked-nucleic acid bases

99

[LNA]) or a double-stranded DNA-binding dye (e.g., SYBR green). As a target region for

100

distinguishing dinoflagellate species, Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS1 and ITS2) of the rRNA

101

operon has been recommended as a high-resolution marker (Stern et al. 2012).

102

The aim of this study was to develop TaqMan qPCR assays applicable for identification and

103

enumeration of A. malmogiense, B. baltica, and G. corollarium in the Baltic Sea plankton, with

104

particular focus on the applicability of these assays in regular monitoring surveys. To ensure the

105

assay specificity, each primer-probe set was tested not only with monocultures of A. malmogiense,

106

B. baltica, G. corollarium, but also with three other dinoflagellate species co-occurring in the Baltic

108

and was validated using field-collected samples (Figure 1).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

111
112

Test strains and environmental samples

113

Cultures. For the assay development, we used cultures of A. malmogiense, B. baltica, G.

114

corollarium, and other dinoflagellate species that might be present in the plankton samples

115

originated from the study area (Table 1, Figure 1). Except for Protodinium simplex, which was

116

ordered from SCCAP (Denmark) and preserved with Lugol iodine solution upon arrival, all

117

cultures used in this study (Table 1) were grown in temperature-regulated incubators at 50 μmol

118

photons m–2 s–1 and a 14:10 h light:dark cycle. As a growth media, F/2-Si enrichment (Guillard and

119

Ryther 1962) and salinity of 6.5 was used; throughout this paper, the salinity values are given in

120

practical salinity units [PSU]. All cultures were grown at 4°C, except for Heterocapsa triquetra,

121

which was maintained at 17°C. Subsamples of the cultures in the exponential growth phase were

122

taken, preserved with Lugol iodine solution, and stored chilled in the dark until they were used for

123

microscopy analysis and DNA extraction.

124

Field samples. In addition to the monocultures, field samples were collected in a coastal area

125

(Himmerfjärden Bay, 58°.59’N, 17°.43’E; bottom depth 32 m) and used for the assay validation

126

(Figure 1). Two time periods were selected for the sample collection to ensure (1) presence of

127

abundant and diverse dinoflagellate communities (March 15–June 8, 2010), when all target species

128

are present ubiquitously in the water column; and (2) absence of any of the target species in the

129

plankton samples (September 28, 2010); by this time all of them should have undergone complete

130

encystment and disappear from the pelagial (Kremp et al. 2009). All samples were collected during

131

the daytime from the photic zone (0–14 m) using a plastic hose (inner diameter of 25 mm), and the

132

entire sample volume was transferred to a bucket. After thorough mixing, two subsamples of the

133

collected plankton were drawn from each sample and designated for: (1) microscopy analysis of

134

the Apocalathium/Biecheleria/Gymnodinium complex; these samples (200 mL) were immediately

135

preserved with 0.8 mL acetic Lugol iodine solution, and (2) qPCR assay; these samples (1 L) were

136

preserved with 4 mL Lugol iodine solution. All samples were stored chilled in darkness until

137

analyses.

Microscopy analysis

140

Subsamples (25 mL) of the phytoplankton samples designated for microscopy-based identification

141

and enumeration of dinoflagellates were settled for 20–40 h in Utermöhl chambers following the

142

guidelines for phytoplankton analysis in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM 2017). Dinoflagellates were

143

counted on the half-bottom or entire bottom of the sedimentation chamber under an inverted light

144

microscope (Leitz DM-II) at 200× or 400× magnification. All counts were conducted in triplicate.

145

Cell concentrations were calculated from obtained counts (cell mL-1) and used for the preparation

146

of dilution series in qPCR assays, in the calculations of rRNA gene copy number per cell, and as

147

an independent estimate of cell abundance.

148
149

Design and verification of specific primers and probes

150

The qPCR approach. For each species, we designed primers and a hydrolysis probe (minor groove

151

binder, MGB), which carries a fluorophore at the 5’-end and a quencher at the 3’-end. The

152

hybridized probe is cleaved by the 5’ exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase resulting in

153

fluorescence increase. The species-specific primers and those probe sequences characterized by the

154

highest number of mismatches to non-target sequences were tested in silico for their specificity by

155

a BLAST sequence similarity search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) against the GenBank

156

nucleotide collection. Due to the additional specificity provided by the presence of the TaqMan

157

probe, this approach was selected because it is less subject to false positives than the intercalating

158

dye method (Kutyavin et al. 2000), which is crucial for mixed plankton samples.

159

Sequence information. The target for designing primers and probes was the rDNA ITS, regions

160

ITS1 and ITS2. Sequencing of B. baltica (strain WHTV-C1) and G. corollarium (strain GCTV-

161

B4) were performed in collaboration with the Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of

162

Urbino, Italy. The 5.8S rRNA gene and flanking ITS regions were amplified and sequenced using

163

the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Cheshire, UK) and an ABI

164

PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer instrument. The sequences have been deposited into the GenBank

165

database (accession numbers MN525428 and MN525429 for G. corollarium GCTV-B4, and B.

166

baltica WHTV-C1, respectively). For B. baltica, WHTV-C1 sequence and GenBank sequence

167

DQ167868 were used to generate a consensus sequence. For A. malmogiense, a consensus sequence

was created based on the GenBank sequences for the following strains: SHTV-2 (AY970655),

169

SHTV-5 (AY970656), SHTV-6 (AY970657), SHTV-1 (AY499515), and 702 (EF205037).

170

qPCR primer and probe design. The primer-probe systems (Table 2) were first tested in silico

171

for specificity. For each target species, alignments were made using the software BioEdit Sequence

172

Alignment Editor version 7.0.9.0 (Hall 1999). Non-target species were included based on

173

taxonomic relatedness to the target species, strong sequence match, and occurrence of the species

174

in the Baltic Sea spring phytoplankton community. The alignments were searched manually to

175

determine unique sequences within the ITS regions relevant for primer and probe design, which

176

was then performed using Primer3 (Whitehead Institute and Howard Hughes Medical Institute,

177

Maryland). A database similarity search was made using BLAST to ensure in silico specificity of

178

primers and probes. Primers were synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB (Stockholm, Sweden)

179

and probes by Applied Biosystems (Cheshire, UK). The probes were dual-labeled with the

180

fluorophore 6FAM and the quencher MGBNFQ at the 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively.

181
182

DNA extraction and quantification

183

DNA extraction. The DNA was obtained by Chelex extraction (Giraffa et al. 2000) using Lugol-

184

preserved samples of dinoflagellates and wild plankton. For all extractions, the appropriate

185

culture/sample volume was filtered onto a 5.0 µm Millipore TMTP Isopore polycarbonate

186

membrane filter (Ø 25 mm) (Millipore, MA, USA) using a 15 mL Millipore filtration tower (Ø 16

187

mm) fitted to a vacuum filtration manifold. The filter was placed in a petri dish and cut diagonally

188

with a scalpel into eight pieces which were all placed in a 2-mL tube. Nuclease-free water (200 µL;

189

Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was added, and samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min and

190

then frozen at -80°C. After thawing, each sample received approximately 100 mg of acid-washed

191

glass beads (≤ 106 μm; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and was homogenized for 2 × 20 s in a

192

FastPrep®-24 Instrument (MP Biomedicals, CA, USA). Then, 200 µL Chelex® 100, 10% w/v

193

(Bio-Rad, CA, USA) were added followed by heating at 50°C for 30 min and then at 105°C for 8

194

min. The sample was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant (100 µL) containing the

195

DNA was transferred into a 1.5-mL tube and stored at 8°C overnight before processing.

196

DNA yield and purity assessment. Quantity and quality of the extracted DNA were evaluated by

197

reading the whole absorption spectrum (220–750 nm) with a NanophotometerTM (Implen), and the

198

DNA quality assessed using absorbance ratio at both 260/280 and 230/260 nm. Both ratios were

199

good in most of the samples (1.8–2.0 and 2.0-2.2, respectively). In addition to the concentrations

200

measured spectrophotometrically, the DNA concentration in each sample was also quantified

201

fluorometrically by staining with Hoechst dye 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich) to avoid an overestimation

202

of the DNA concentration measured by Nanophotometer (Bhat et al. 2010). The fluorometry-based

203

DNA concentrations were applied to estimate template concentration in the TaqMan real-time PCR

204

reaction.

205
206

DNA standards and qPCR standard curves

207

Synthetic standards for qPCR. For all three species, gene-based standard curves were constructed

208

to determine the efficiency of the assay, using a synthetic gene fragment approach (Vermeulen et

209

al. 2009). A synthetic DNA oligonucleotide (Invitrogen Ltd.) comprising the target sequences

210

(Table 3) and cloned into a plasmid was used as a standard (Figure 2). For each target species, the

211

synthetic gene was assembled and cloned into pMA-T plasmid using Sfil and Sfil cloning sites. The

212

plasmid DNA was purified from transformed bacteria (E. coli, K-12), and concentration was

213

determined by UV spectroscopy. The final construct was verified by sequencing, and the

214

congruence within the restriction site was 100%. For curves based on synthetic gene fragments, a

215

10-fold serial dilution ranging 75 to 75×105 copies per reaction for all species of the plasmid

216

construct containing the target sequence, were generated and used as a template. Each reaction was

217

performed in duplicate.

218

Cell-based standard curves and determination of gene copy number per cell. One strain of

219

each species, A. malmogiense (SHTV-5), B. baltica (WHTV-S1), and G. corollarium (GCTV-B4),

220

were used to extract genomic DNA and construct cell-based standard curves. These extractions

221

were serially diluted and used to generate target DNA representing a known cell number per

222

reaction versus Ct data. The cell-based standard curves were constructed using 10-fold dilutions of

223

the DNA extract using known cell concentrations ranging 1 to 8×103 cells mL-1 for A. malmogiense,

224

1 to 7×103 cells mL-1 for B. baltica, and 1 to 9×103 cells mL-1 for G. corollarium. Each reaction

225

was performed in triplicate.

226

Determination of gene copy number per cell. To determine the mean number of the rRNA gene

227

copies per cell, the dilution series with a known cell count and gene-based Ct values were used as

228

input for calculation. The slope of the linear regression between the rRNA gene copies and cell

numbers in the reaction was used to determine the copy number per cell. This analysis was

230

conducted for three strains per target species (Table 1).

232

Assay performance

233

Primer performance. Candidate primers for A. malmogiense, B. baltica, and G. corollarium were

234

tested using conventional PCR and DNA extracts from the monocultures of SHTV-5, WHTV-S1,

235

and GCTV-B4, respectively. Each PCR reaction contained 2 µL of extracted DNA, 5 µL of

236

Standard Taq Reaction Buffer (Final concentration 2.5×, 3.75 mM MgCl2, New England BioLabs,

237

MA, USA), 1 µL of dNTPs (final concentration 0.5 mM, New England BioLabs), 0.5 µL of Taq

238

polymerase (corresponding to 2.5 units, New England BioLabs), 2 µL of each primer (final

239

concentrations 1 µM), and 7.5 µL of nuclease-free water (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) resulting in a

240

total reaction volume of 20 µL. For the non-template controls (NTC), nuclease-free water was used

241

instead of DNA. Samples were amplified using MJ Research MiniCycler for 2 min at 94°C

242

followed by 30 cycles of 15 s at 94°C, 15 s at 60°C and 45 s at 72°C with a final extension step for

243

7 min at 72°C. PCR products were mixed with 6× loading dye solution and ran on a 1.5 % agarose

244

gel. GeneRuler 100 bp DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) was used as a marker. The gel

245

was stained with ethidium bromide (0.2 µg/L) for 20 min, rinsed in distilled water for 7 min and

246

visualized under UV light. All gels were examined to ensure that the PCR products had the

247

expected size (bp) and no amplification occurred in NTC. Two main criteria for primer selection

248

for qPCR were used: (1) efficient amplification as indicated by clear and sharp bands in the gels,

249

and (2) the product size, with shorter amplicon size being favored as more suitable for qPCR (Penna

250

and Galluzzi 2013).

251

Primer-probe performance. To ensure proper binding to the target species, functional primers

252

with the corresponding probes were tested by qPCR using a StepOne Real-Time PCR instrument

253

(Applied Biosystems). The following reagents were added for a 20 µL reaction mixture: 10 µL of

254

TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 1.5 µL of each primer (0.75 µM),

255

0.5 µL of the probe (0.25 µM), 2 µL of the DNA extracted from a target species, and 4.5 µL of

256

nuclease-free water. For the NTC, nuclease-free water was used instead of DNA. The thermal

257

cycling conditions consisted of 2 min at 50°C and 10 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at

258

95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Fluorescence data were collected at the end of each cycle, and the cycle

259

threshold was determined automatically by the instrument software. Extracted DNA from the

260

cultures SHVT-5, WHTV-S1 and GCTV-B4 was used in six-step tenfold serial dilutions (1×–105×)

261

and primer-probe sets were evaluated based on the qPCR efficiency and correlation coefficients

262

(R2). All samples, standards, and NTC were analyzed in triplicates.

263

Reproducibility of the standard curve assays. The method's reproducibility (inter-assay

264

variation) was assayed by calculating the CVCt (coefficient of variation for cycle threshold) of

265

gene- and cell-based standards in independent experiments run on different days using different

266

sets of dilutions; five assays were used for gene-based standard curves and four assays were used

267

for cell-based standard curves. The replicate standard curves were produced with the final set of

primers and probes using a serial dilution series over the six-step tenfold serial dilutions (1×–105×).

269

The inter-run variation was calculated for Ct values as described by Rutledge and Côté (Rutledge

270

and Côté 2003). For each primer-probe set the pooled slope and intercept was calculated and used

271

for downstream applications of the gene-based standard curve.

272

Specificity testing. The specificity of each assay was confirmed by using DNA from the non-

273

target species as a template. More specifically, cross-reactivity between primers and probe for A.

274

malmogiense were tested with DNA extracted from the other two species, and the same was done

275

for the assays developed for B. baltica and G. corollarium. The specificity of each primer-probe

276

set was further tested by screening against non-target species Heterocapsa triquetra, Peridiniella

277

catenata and Protodinium simplex (Table 1) that are phylogenetically close to the target species

278

(Saldarriaga et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2007). All primer-probe sets were also tested with DNA from

279

a field sample collected in spring 2010—a time when all target species were expected to be present

280

in the water column. The qPCR-products were sequenced (KIGene, Karolinska University

281

Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden) to confirm the specificity of the assays. Furthermore, a field sample

282

collected in the fall, not containing the target species, was also used in the qPCR assay. As positive

283

controls, samples with the target species DNA were included in all assays.

284
285

Statistical analysis

286

Statistics were performed with the GraphPad software, version 7 (GraphPad Software Inc.). The

287

degree of linear relationship between data (R2 coefficient) was determined as the Pearson

288

correlation coefficient and F-test was used to determine the overall significance of the regression.

289

The regressions were compared with no assumption of the homogeneity of variances (Smithson

290

2012).

RESULTS

292
293

Optimization of primer-probe performance with conventional PCR and qPCR assays

294

Apocalathium malmogiense. Out of seven primer pairs (Table 2), one pair (S416F/S494R)

295

produced an unspecific product in the NTC. All other pairs amplified the desired DNA region with

296

no amplification in the NTC. However, the pair S366F/S542R was eliminated from further testing

297

because of the relatively large amplicon, which was considered as suboptimal for qPCR. The

298

remaining five pairs were combined with probes and tested in the qPCR assays. Among those, the

299

best reaction efficiency (94.8) and R2 (~1.00) were observed in the qPCR assay with primers

300

S459F/S542R in combination with the probe S484.

301

Biecheleria baltica. Out of six primer pairs (Table 2), two pairs (B86F/B211R and B504F/B601R)

302

produced unspecific products in the NTC and were eliminated from further testing. The remaining

303

four pairs amplified the target region with no product in the NTC. Two of these, B51F/B211R and

304

B134F/B211R were chosen for downstream qPCR testing, in combination with compatible probes

305

(B169 in both cases). In the qPCR tests, the superior efficiency and R2 values, 93.3 and ~1.00,

306

respectively, were obtained for the primers B51F/B211R.

307

Gymnodinium corollarium. All four primer pairs (Table 2) amplified the desired target region

308

with no amplification in the NTC. In the qPCR assay, the primer set G458F/G602R with G535

309

probe produced standard curves with the highest efficiency (96.9) and R2 = 0.99 (mean values for

310

both parameters). In no case, a positive amplification was observed in the NTC of qPCR.

311
312

Overall performance and reproducibility of the standard curve assays

313

For both gene- and cell-based assays, the standard curves were highly reproducible with high linear

314

range (Figure 3), efficiency >90% (with a very few exceptions; Table 4 and Table 5), and low

315

inter-assay variation assayed by CVCt (Table 6 and Table 7).

316

Gene-based standard curves. The gene-based standard curves covered linear detection over six

317

orders of magnitude, with a mean qPCR efficiency of 96%, 94% and 91% for G. corollarium, A.

318

malmogiense, and B. baltica, respectively (Table 4 and Figure 3A). The detection limit tested was

319

75 gene copy numbers in all assays. The Ct for the lowest gene copy number tested varied from

320

33.6 in GCTV to 34.7 in WHTV, so it is not likely that the sensitivity lower than 75 gene copy

321

numbers can be achieved. The inter-assay variation was low, with CVCt mean values of the standard

322

curves being 1.3%, 0.8% and 0.7% for B. baltica, A. malmogiense, and G. corollarium, respectively

323

(Table 6 and Figure 4A). The CVCt was not related to the copy number in the reaction in all assays.

324

The pooled slope and intercept, calculated for the respective target species standard curve, are

325

provided in table 4.

326
327

Cell-based standard curves. The cell-based standard curves covered linear detection over six

328

orders of magnitude, with a mean qPCR efficiency of 94% for A. malmogiense and B. baltica and

329

92% for G. corollarium (Table 5 and Figure 3B). For all three species, the detection limit tested

330

was less than one cell in the reaction. The CVCt mean values of the standard curves for the target

331

species were 1.7%, 1.1% and 1.0% for B. baltica, A. malmogiense and G. corollarium, respectively,

332

and remained at ≤1.0% for all species in the low cell abundance range (1 to 102 cells mL-1). In B.

333

baltica, the CVCt was significantly positively related to the cell abundance, whereas the relationship

334

for A. malmogiense was nearly significant (Figure 4). In G. corollarium, the CVCt was the lowest

335

among the three species (Table 7) and unrelated to the cell abundance (Figure 4).

336
337

Evaluation of primer-probe specificity

338

No cross-reactivity for any of the laboratory strains of A. malmogiense, B. baltica and G.

339

corollarium was observed (Table 8). Similarly, no amplification was observed for DNA extracted

340

from the cultures of Heterocapsa triquetra, Peridiniella catenata, and Protodinium simplex, except

341

for a few cases where non-specific product was observed after more than 35 cycles (the dynamic

342

range of the assays; Figure 3A). Sequencing of the qPCR-products from the spring bloom field

343

sample DNA confirmed the presence of all three target species and the specificity of the assays.

344

Moreover, when the environmental DNA extracted from the field sample collected in September

345

2010 was used as a template, no specific amplification was observed with any of the primer-probe

346

sets selected for the species-specific qPCR assays for A. malmogiense, B. baltica and G.

347

corollarium, which was consistent with the absence of the species from the phytoplankton

348

community at the time. However, for the B. baltica and G. corollarium primer-probe sets, some

349

unspecific amplification occurred at Ct > 34, corresponding to the end of the standard curve and

350

outside of the standard curve, respectively.

353

Correspondence between microscopy- and qPCR-based estimates of cell abundance

354

There was very strong (R2 > 0.98 in all cases) correlation between the cell abundance estimates

355

based on qPCR and the Utermöhl counts (Table 9). However, the qPCR assays consistently

356

overestimated the number of cells in the culture samples used in the laboratory testing (Figure 6).

357

Moreover, neither the slopes or the intercepts of the regression lines for the test strains were

358

significantly different (slopes: F2,12 = 2.597, p > 0.12; the pooled slope equals 5.12; intercepts: F2,14

359

= 0.059, p > 0.94; the pooled intercept equals -217).

360
361

Screening environmental samples for target species

362

To evaluate the adequacy of the developed qPCR assays for environmental screening, they were

363

applied to environmental community DNA extracts from plankton collected in a coastal area of the

364

Northern Baltic Proper during spring bloom 2010 (Figure 1). For consistency, the pooled slope

365

and intercept for the plasmid standard curve for each species (Table 4) were used when estimating

366

cell abundances in the field samples. To convert the Ct values to the cell abundance estimates, we

367

applied the average rRNA gene copy number observed for each species (Figure 5). Variable cell

371

on all sampling occasions, whereas A. malmogiense was detected only twice and at low

372

abundances. At moderate numbers, B. baltica was detected on all sampling occasions. The

373

regression for the qPCR vs. microscopy was highly significant, although the qPCR-based estimates

374

in most cases exceeded those based on the light microscopy (2.4-fold on average; Figure 8). Within

375

the observed range of the dinoflagellate abundance (4 to 4×105 cells L-1), there was a significant

positive relationship for the fold-difference (between the qPCR and microscopy counts) and the

DISCUSSION

385

In order to understand the dynamics of ecologically important algal blooms and to mitigate their

386

impact on environmental and human health, it is important to optimize their monitoring in terms

387

of frequency, sensitivity, and rapidity. Towards this goal, we need reliable and fast molecular

388

methods with high sample throughput and low quantification thresholds. The identification of

389

Baltic dinoflagellates in natural samples is currently based on light microscopy, but because of the

390

low optical resolution that cannot visualize morphological differences among Apocalathium

391

malmogiense, Biecheleria baltica, and Gymnodinium corollarium, species-level distinction is not

392

possible. Moreover, even for experts, the identification is difficult, labor-intensive, and prone to

393

errors, especially when several small-sized species co-occur in natural samples. To confirm the

394

identification based on light microscopy, sophisticated equipment, such as SEM can be used, but

395

it is not suitable for routine analysis of monitoring samples.

396

In the last decades, various molecular assays (e.g., real-time PCR, fluorescent hybridization assay,

397

high resolution melting [HRM], sandwich hybridization assay, etc.) were shown to be instrumental

398

for identification and enumeration of dinoflagellates. Earlier, a molecular identification method

399

based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay has been developed for B. baltica

400

(Sundström et al. 2010). The method was successfully applied to study the seasonal succession of

401

this dinoflagellate at the SW coast of Finland. However, the labeling efficiency was affected by

402

physiological changes in the algae during the bloom due to nutrient limitation, growth phase, and

403

life cycle transitions; therefore, the quantification was prone to uncertainties (Sundström et al.

404

2010). Given the high specificity of the assays developed for many dinoflagellate species, a way

405

forward for identification and quantification of the Apocalathium/Biecheleria/Gymnodinium

406

complex would be applying the taxa-specific qPCR assays. Moreover, it is desirable that such

407

assays would be applicable for regular plankton samples collected during monitoring and other

408

surveys and preserved according to the existing monitoring practices (HELCOM 2017).

409

Here, we developed qPCR assays that can be used to rapidly detect co-occurring and

410

morphologically similar dinoflagellates in plankton samples collected in the Baltic Sea. Species-

411

specific qPCR primers and probes with high specificity and sensitivity were developed for three

412

species, A. malmogiense, B. baltica, and G. corollarium. We also established that these primer-

413

probe sets were effective in measuring the abundance of all three species in a coastal area of the

414

Northern Baltic Proper. The cross-reactivity of the primers designed in this study showed high

15
415

specificity for each target species while not amplifying when tested against other dinoflagellates

416

reported from the study area. The species tested for cross-reactivity were chosen because they

417

represented species that are genetically most similar to each target species for the ITS region;

418

therefore, it is likely that the most likely candidates for false identification were included in the

419

testing. Notably, the forward primer for Apocalathium malmogiense, S459F, also matches the ITS

420

sequence of A. aciculiferum (Lemmermann) Craveiro, Daugbjerg, Moestrup & Calado (Craveiro

421

et al. 2017). The reason is that A. malmogiense and A. aciculiferum have identical rDNA sequences

422

and are believed to have diverged very recently (Logares et al. 2007). Therefore, it is likely that a

423

positive amplification for A. aciculiferum can be obtained using the primer-probe system developed

424

for A. malmogiense, but we have not tested it. However, besides having different morphological

425

features compared to A. malmogiense, A. aciculiferum is a freshwater species inhabiting lakes, and

426

it has not been reported in the marine environments, including the Baltic Sea. Therefore, we believe

427

that for application in the Baltic, the selected system would be specific for A. malmogiense.

428

The mean amplification efficiencies for the developed gene- and cell-based assays targeting G.

429

corollarium, A. malmogiense and B. baltica were >90%, with a 6-log linear dynamic range of

430

quantification (Table 4 and Table 5). The assays were sensitive as indicated by the fact that less

431

than a single cell or 75 gene copies per reaction were sufficient to obtain a positive amplification.

432

The quantification limit, below a single cell for all species (Table 6 and Table 7), reflects the high

433

rRNA gene copy number per cell. Indeed, as in other dinoflagellates, the rDNA operon is tandemly

434

repeated up to thousands of copies (Saito et al. 2002; Galluzzi et al. 2004), which is supported by

435

the observed variability in the rRNA gene copy numbers within and across the species (Figure 5).

436

It is also possible that within-strain variability is also substantial depending on the life cycle and

437

growth conditions as reported for several Alexandrium species in the Mediterranean Sea (Galluzzi

438

et al. 2010).

439

Absolute quantification is usually determined by comparison to standard curves from target DNA

440

using cell-based assays. However, the use of cell-based assays for quantification is complicated by

441

the fact that dinoflagellates contain multiple copies of the rRNA gene (Guo et al. 2016). As we had

442

no prior knowledge on the copy number variability between the target species and between

443

different isolates of the same species, we used the synthetic gene standard and the developed qPCR

444

assays to determine the relative difference in rDNA copy numbers between our target species and

445

test strains (Figure 5). These data showed that there are indeed differences between the copy

16
446

numbers both between species and between isolates within a single species, with the highest copy

447

number observed in A. malmogiense and the lowest in G. corollarium. Moreover, the copy numbers

448

varied by 8-, 11- and 2-fold, between different isolates of B. baltica, G. corollarium, and A.

449

malmogiense, respectively. The rRNA cell copy number determined in this study were within the

450

range of values reported for other dinoflagellates (Galluzzi et al. 2004, 2010; Penna and Galluzzi

451

2013).

452

Although we did not compare all dinoflagellate species listed in Table 1, the variability observed

453

for the tested species and strains suggest that including more cultures in the cell copy number

454

comparisons would increase the span of the observed values. Clearly, the use of cell-based standard

455

curve would require more understanding of the ecological and evolutionary drivers of the rDNA

456

operon variability for the species in question. To address these challenges, the synthetic gene

457

approach is very instrumental and can be used for screening of field samples and determination of

458

the absolute abundance of the target rRNA gene as well as the determination of cell copy number

459

in specific strains and isolates. Given the observed cell copy numbers (Figure 5) and the dynamic

460

range of the assays (Table 6. and Table 7), the sensitivity of the gene-based assays allows the

461

analysis of less than a single cell in a qPCR reaction.

462

Accuracy of the absolute quantification approach relies on the quality of standard curve

463

construction by controlling the precision and reproducibility (Rutledge and Côté 2003). A standard

464

curve is generally considered to be of high quality if the correlation found between the log-copy

465

numbers and the Ct values shows a coefficient superior to 0.99. Here, for all three species, the

466

linearity was excellent (R2 > 0.99). However, the regression coefficient is a poor indicator of the

467

precision or accuracy achieved (Rutledge and Côté 2003). In the comparison of Ct values among

468

five independent runs of the cell-based assays, we found an average CVCt variation of <2% for all

469

species (Table 7 and Figure 4B), which appeared to indicate a good reproducibly between runs.

470

Moreover, in the low range of the target cells, the CVCt values were below 1% (Table 4), indicating

471

that at the environmentally relevant concentrations of the dinoflagellates, the assays are highly

472

reproducible. As expected, the inter-assay variation for the gene-based assays was even lower

473

(CVCt <1%; Table 6 and Figure 4A), emphasizing usefulness of the synthetic standard for internal

474

quality control of the assay reproducibility (Vermeulen et al. 2009; Conte et al. 2018).

475

A correspondence was found between the results obtained with microscopy and those found with

476

each of the qPCR assays applied to the single-species cultures (Figure 6). This high correlation

477

was also evident when the abundance of the entire Apocalathium/Biecheleria/Gymnodinium

478

complex was estimated during the bloom event in a coastal area of the Northern Baltic Proper

479

(Figure 7 and Figure 8). However, the qPCR assays consistently overestimated the cell abundance,

480

both in the laboratory tests with monocultures (5-fold; Figure 6) and in the mixed field-sampled

481

plankton (2-fold; Figure 8). A difference of this magnitude would lead to considerably different

482

abundance estimates of the target species. Moreover, the discrepancy between the qPCR-based

483

estimates and the microscopy counts increased significantly with increasing cell abundance,

484

indicating that during the peak bloom, the uncertainty would be the highest. The mounting evidence

485

of intra-strain variability in detectable rDNA copy numbers and growth rate could have severe

486

implications for qPCR-based cell enumeration of dinoflagellates, but also other groups, such as

487

diatoms (Guo et al. 2016), and requires further investigation.

488

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the usefulness of real-time PCR as a sensitive and rapid

489

molecular technique for the detection and quantification of A. malmogiense, B. baltica, and G.

490

corollarium from environmental samples. For each species, the inter-assay variation of the cell-

491

based assays was low, with CVCt <1% in the ecologically relevant range of population abundance,

492

which facilitates their applicability in the analysis of the monitoring or other samples that are

493

collected and analyzed continuously. The assays developed are highly specific and sensitive in the

494

unambiguous detection of all three species, and thus are valuable for routine plankton,

495

biogeographic and phylogenetic investigations. Future studies should address ecological and

496

phylogenetic aspects of rRNA copy number variability and improve its assessment in the

497

monitoring and field studies of A. malmogiense, B. baltica, and G. corollarium.
