Abstract

22

Brain endothelium possesses several organ-specific features collectively known as the blood-

23

brain barrier (BBB). In addition, trafficking of immune cells in the healthy central nervous

24

system (CNS) is tightly regulated by CNS vasculature. In CNS autoimmune diseases such as

25

multiple sclerosis (MS), these homeostatic mechanisms are overcome by autoreactive

lymphocyte entry into the CNS causing inflammatory demyelinating immunopathology.

27

Previous studies have shown that pericytes regulate the development of organ-specific

28

characteristics of brain vasculature such as the BBB and astrocytic end-feet. Whether pericytes

29

are involved in the control of leukocyte trafficking remains elusive. Using adult, pericyte-

30

deficient mice (Pdgfbret/ret), we show here that brain vasculature devoid of pericytes shows

31

increased expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which is accompanied by increased leukocyte

32

infiltration of dendritic cells, monocytes and T cells into the brain, but not spinal cord

33

parenchyma. Regional differences enabling leukocyte trafficking into the brain as opposed to

34

the spinal cord inversely correlate with the pericyte coverage of blood vessels. Upon induction

35

of experimental autoimmune encephalitomyelitis (EAE), pericyte-deficient mice succumb to

36

severe neurological impairment. Treatment with first line MS therapy - fingolimod significantly

37

reverses EAE, indicating that the observed phenotype is due to the massive influx of immune

38

cells into the brain. Furthermore, pericyte-deficiency in mice that express myelin

39

oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG35-55) specific T cell receptor (Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2Tg)

40

leads to the development of spontaneous neurological symptoms paralleled by massive influx

41

of leukocytes into the brain, suggesting altered brain vascular immune quiescence as a prime

42

cause of exaggerated neuroinflammation. Thus, we show that pericytes indirectly restrict

43

immune cell transmigration into the CNS under homeostatic conditions and during

44

autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation by inducing immune quiescence of brain endothelial

45

cells.

Introduction

48

CNS vasculature possesses specific features collectively referred to as the BBB, which localizes

49

to endothelial cells. The BBB ensures the delivery of essential nutrients, while preventing the

50

entry of xenobiotics into the brain. In addition, brain endothelial cells restrict the invasion of

leukocytes into brain parenchyma, thus contributing to immune privilege of the CNS. BBB

52

function is induced by neural tissue and established by all cell types constituting the

53

neurovascular unit (NVU). Pericytes and mural cells residing on the abluminal side of

54

capillaries and post-capillary venules, regulate several features of the BBB 1, 2. Studies on Pdgfb

55

and Pdgfrb mouse mutants, which exhibit variable pericyte loss, have demonstrated that

56

pericytes negatively regulate endothelial transcytosis which, if not suppressed, leads to

57

increased BBB permeability to plasma proteins 1, 2. In addition, pericyte-deficient vessels show

58

abnormal astrocyte end-feet polarization 1. Thus, pericytes regulate several characteristics of

75

pathological changes at the NVU, which may facilitate entry of autoimmune T-cells as well as

76

the anatomical localization of lesions.

77

In this study, we investigate how pericytes regulate immune cell trafficking into the CNS

78

during homeostasis and neuroinflammation. We show, using a pericyte deficient mouse line

79

(Pdgfbret/ret), that pericytes maintain an anti-inflammatory vascular phenotype and thus prevent

80

leukocyte extravasation into the brain parenchyma. When neuroinflammation is induced,

81

pericyte deficiency promotes an exaggerated phenotype accompanied by massive immune cell

82

infiltration preferentially into the brain, as opposed to the spinal cord. The MS drug fingolimod

83

rescues the exaggerated phenotype indicating that the severe phenotype in Pdgfbret/ret mice is

84

caused by immune cell infiltration into the brain. In addition, pericyte-deficient mice harboring

85

naive MOG peptide-specific T-cells (Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2Tg) develop cerebellar ataxia and massive

86

infiltration of leukocytes into the brain. We show that regional differences in the permissiveness

87

to leukocyte trafficking into the brain as opposed to the spinal cord inversely correlates with

88

the vessel pericyte-coverage suggesting vasculature of the CNS directing the spatial distribution

89

of neuroinflammation.

Results

92

Pericytes control expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules in the brain vasculature

93

To address the question of whether pericytes regulate immune cell trafficking into the CNS, we

94

used a pericyte-deficient mouse line - Pdgfbret/ret, which shows 89% reduction in brain pericyte

95

numbers and 75% reduction in pericyte vessel coverage in adult animals 1. Earlier studies have

96

shown that pericyte-deficiency in embryos leads to increased mRNA levels of leukocyte

97

adhesion molecules (LAMs) on endothelial cells1, 2. We analyzed published microarray data of

98

adult Pdgfbret/ret brain microvasculature and detected a deregulation of several LAMs, including

99

vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (log2=0.43, p=0.007), in adult brain

100

microvasculature abated in pericyte numbers (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To corroborate these

101

findings, we investigated whether strongly reduced pericyte coverage in adult mice leads to

102

changes of LAMs at the protein level. We focused on the expression of VCAM-1 and

103

intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which play a major role in the cascade of immune

104

cell transmigration into tissues 12. We detected a zonated endothelial expression of both LAMs

105

in control mice (Fig. 1a, b), similar to a published study 13. In brains of Pdgfbret/ret mice, the

106

zonated expression pattern was lost and paralleled by a conspicuously stronger staining of

107

VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 (Fig. 1a, b). Quantification of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 vessel surface

108

coverage in the cerebral cortex and in the striatum showed a significant increase of VCAM-1

109

and ICAM-1 expression in Pdgfbret/ret mice compared to controls (Fig. 1c). Thus, pericyte-

110

deficiency results in an increased expression of LAMs on the brain vasculature also in adult

111

mice.

112
113

Pericytes control leukocyte extravasation into the brain

114

We next asked whether increased expression of LAMs on the brain endothelium of pericyte-

115

deficient mice is accompanied by leukocyte infiltration into brain parenchyma. We first

116

analyzed the presence of CD45hi leukocytes in different anatomical regions of the brain by

117

immunofluorescent staining and confocal imaging. Adult Pdgfbret/ret mice showed numerous

118

CD45hi leukocyte infiltrates in the brain parenchyma (Fig. 2a). High magnification images

119

revealed that CD45hi cells were found in the vessel lumen, in the brain parenchyma and

120

clustered around blood vessels in the brains of Pdgfbret/ret mice, whereas in control mice CD45hi

121

cells were detected but they resided in the lumen of blood vessels (Fig. 2b). Although all

122

cerebral regions in Pdgfbret/ret mice showed altered vascular expression of LAMs and immune

123

cell infiltrates, quantification of extravasated leukocytes in different brain regions showed that

124

corpus callosum contained more transmigrated CD45hi cells compared to the striatum and

126

Pdgfbret/ret mice showed the absence of immune cell infiltrates in the spinal cord parenchyma

127

(Supplementary Fig. 1b).

128

Having established that brain parenchyma of Pdgfbret/ret mice contains CD45hi cells, we

129

used flow cytometry to identify immune cell populations. To give an overview of all immune

130

cell populations in the CNS, leukocytes were isolated from the CNS, analyzed by flow

134

of pericyte-deficient mice. The majority of cells increased in Pdgfbret/ret mice were

135

CD45hiCD11b+ myeloid cells (mainly composed of monocytes and CD11c+ dendritic cells

136

(DCs)), and T cells (Fig. 2d). Quantification of the absolute cell numbers of manually gated

137

immune cells subsets showed a significant increase in the number of CD45hiCD11b+ myeloid

138

cells, DCs (3.5% of the CD45hiCD11b+ population), and CD4+ T cell populations compared to

139

controls (Fig. 2e). In addition, we observed an increased number of Ly6ChiMHC-II+ monocyte

140

derived cells (MdCs) and the CD8+ T cell population in the CNS of pericyte-deficient animals

141

compared to controls (Fig. 2e). Subsequent flow cytometry analysis of brain and spinal cord

142

separately confirmed the presence of CD45hi cells (DCs, MdCs, T cells) in brain and the absence

of CD45hi cells in the spinal cord of Pdgfbret/ret mice (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d).

(Supplementary Fig. 2a). Subsequent analysis of leukocyte populations did not show a skewing

151

between Pdgfbret/ret and control mice in blood, lymph nodes and spleen (Supplementary Fig. 2b,

152

c, d). However, the spleens of Pdgfbret/ret mice showed slightly elevated numbers of CD8+ T

153

cells compared to controls (Supplementary Fig. 2c). There was no difference in the total

154

leukocyte or in the neutrophil count in blood (Supplementary Fig. 1b), indicating the absence

155

of systemic inflammation in Pdgfbret/ret mice. Histological examination of lymphoid organs did

156

not show any differences in the spatial organization of T and B cells (Supplementary Fig. 2f-h)

157

between Pdgfbret/ret and control mice. Thus, the increased number of infiltrated leukocyte

158

subsets in the brain of pericyte-deficient mice is not due to increased numbers in the blood or

159

lymphoid organs.

160

Taken together, our data show that in the absence of pericytes, the adult brain vasculature

161

becomes permissive for leukocyte entry and that the infiltrated leukocyte population consists

162

mostly of dendritic cells, MdCs and T cells.

163
164

Spatial differences in pericyte coverage in the CNS of Pdgfbret/ret mice

165

Previous studies have shown a negative correlation between pericyte coverage and BBB

166

permeability in the brain

167

into the brain in Pdgfbret/ret (Supplementary Fig. 1b-d) mice can be explained by differences in

168

capillary pericyte coverage in the brain and spinal cord. Immunofluorescent staining of

169

vasculature and pericytes revealed a reduced pericyte coverage on blood vessels in the spinal

170

cord of Pdgfbret/ret mice compared to controls. However, capillary pericyte coverage in the

171

spinal cord in Pdgfbret/ret mice was more complete when compared to different brain regions

172

(cortex and striatum) (Fig. 3a). In sharp contrast to the brain vasculature, the pattern and

173

morphology of spinal cord vasculature appeared similar to control mice (Fig. 3a).

174

Quantification of vessel surface pericyte coverage in the spinal cord showed that Pdgfbret/ret

175

mice have a significantly reduced capillary pericyte coverage compared to control animals (Fig.

176

3b). However, the observed ~26% reduction of pericyte coverage in spinal cord vasculature of

177

Pdgfbret/ret mice is notably less than the previously reported reduction of pericyte coverage in

178

the cortex or deep brain regions (~75 %)7, 1, 14. Finally, we investigated whether higher capillary

179

pericyte coverage in the spinal cord of Pdgfbret/ret mice parallels normalized expression of

180

VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Indeed, the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on spinal cord

181

vasculature showed a similar zonal expression pattern in control and Pdgfbret/ret mice (Fig. 3c,

182

d). Based on these data, we conclude that regional differences in the degree of capillary pericyte

183

coverage in the CNS determine the extent to which brain vasculature expresses LAMs and

184

thereby leukocyte entry into the CNS.

185
186

Loss of pericytes does not alter myelin integrity

187

We next asked whether increased BBB permeability to plasma proteins 1, 2 and leukocytes leads

188

to subclinical demyelination in the brains of pericyte-deficient mice. Myelin was visualized

189

luxol fast blue – periodic acid Schiff (LFB-PAS) histochemical stains as well as

190

immunofluorescent labelling with anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) antibody (Supplementary

191

Fig. 3a, c). Quantification of LFB-PAS and anti-MBP staining intensity in the region of high

192

myelin content, the corpus callosum, did not differ between control and Pdgfbret/ret mice

193

(Supplementary Fig. 3b, d). A few brain sections of Pdgfbret/ret mice stained with LFB-PAS had

200

Pericyte-deficient mice present with an aggravated, atypical EAE phenotype

201

We next investigated whether leukocyte permissive vasculature modifies the course of

202

autoimmune neuroinflammation. In order to address this question, we induced EAE, an animal

203

model of MS 17 in control and Pdgfbret/ret mice. After active induction of EAE, which replicates

204

both the induction and effector phase of the disease, Pdgfbret/ret mice presented with a severe,

205

early onset (4-5 day p.i.) atypical phenotype as well as reduced survival (Fig. 4a, b). We

206

confirmed that control animals in the study (Pdgfbwt/ret) did not differ from wild-type littermates

207

in the clinical course of EAE (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Therefore, Pdgfbwt/ret mice continued

208

to be used as controls. All control mice presented typical spinal cord EAE signs with ascending

209

paralysis starting at the distal tail. All Pdgfbret/ret mice invariably developed the atypical

210

phenotype, which consisted of prominent cerebellar ataxia and spasticity, without ascending

211

paralysis. To score the clinical severity of EAE in Pdgfbret/ret mice (Fig. 4b), we adopted an

212

ataxia scoring protocol described by Guyenet et al. 18. We noticed that Pdgfbret/ret mice presented

213

with a basal ataxia score of 2 already at day 0, which consisted of kyphosis (score 1) and

214

hindlimb clasping (score 1) (Fig. 4b, see “Material and Methods” for the scoring protocol).

215

Adoptive transfer (passive) EAE resulted in the same aggravated atypical EAE in Pdgfbret/ret

216

mice as seen in active EAE (Fig. 4c), indicating that the severe phenotype is not due to a

217

pathologically enhanced induction phase in pericyte-deficient mice. Immunization with a non-

218

CNS antigen (ovalbumin peptide), using the same adjuvant, did not result in clinical deficits

219

neither in control nor in Pdgfbret/ret mice (data not shown).

220

We next investigated the spatial distribution of infiltrating cells in the CNS after induction

221

of EAE using immunohistochemistry. This analysis showed an increased leukocyte infiltration

222

into the brain parenchyma (cerebral cortex, striatum, corpus callosum, cerebellum, brain stem)

223

of Pdgfbret/ret animals, whereas immune cell infiltrates were mostly found in the spinal cord in

224

control animals (Fig. 4d, e; Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). The spinal cords of pericyte-deficient

225

animals were devoid of T-cell infiltrates consistent with the atypical clinical phenotype (Fig.

226

4e) and with relatively complete vessel pericyte coverage (Fig. 3). Assessment of myelin

227

damage after the induction of EAE showed pronounced demyelination in the brains of pericyte-

228

deficient mice compared to control animals (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f).

229

We next analyzed which immune cells infiltrate the CNS after active immunization in

230

control and Pdgfbret/ret mice. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the immunohistochemistry

231

results showing an increased number of CD45hi leukocytes in the brains in Pdgfbret/ret mice

232

compared to controls (Fig. 4f, g). The majority of these infiltrates (approx. 60 % of live singlets)

233

in Pdgfbret/ret mice were CD45hiCD11b+ myeloid cells (Fig. 4f). Within this population, we

234

detected a significant increase of MdC and Ly6ChiMHC-II- subpopulations in the brains of

235

Pdgfbret/ret mice compared to controls (Fig. 4g). In addition, there was a trend towards an

236

increased number of CD4+ T cells in the brains of Pdgfbret/ret mice (Fig. 4g), but no difference

237

in total numbers of neutrophils or B cells (Supplementary Fig. 3g). In agreement with the

238

clinical deficits and immunohistochemistry, the spinal cord of Pdgfbret/ret mice was essentially

239

devoid of leukocytes compared to controls (Fig. 4h, i; Supplementary Fig. 3h).

240

Thus, Pdgfbret/ret mice develop a severe, atypical EAE phenotype and show spatially

241

restricted infiltration of inflammatory cells predominantly into brain, consisting mostly of MdC

242

and Ly6ChiMHC-II- myeloid cell populations.

243
244

MS drug fingolimod (FTY-720) ameliorates the severe atypical EAE phenotype of

246

We next addressed whether the aggravated phenotype of Pdgfbret/ret mice after induction of EAE

247

is caused by the massive influx of peripheral immune cells into the CNS. Mice were treated

248

daily, starting on day 4 post-immunization, with FTY-720 (Fingolimod), a functional antagonist

249

of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1), which causes leukopenia by blocking the egress

250

of lymphocytes from lymph nodes 19. All vehicle-treated Pdgfbret/ret mice reached termination

251

criteria (ataxia score 8.5-10) after EAE induction whereas FTY-720 treated Pdgfbret/ret mice did

252

not develop symptoms of EAE during the course of the experiment (25 days) (Fig. 5a, b). Of

253

note, the ataxia score 2 observed in all Pdgfbret/ret mice before FTY-720 administration was not

254

alleviated by FTY-720 treatment. As expected, the EAE score of vehicle-treated control animals

255

improved by day 25 postimmunization. In addition, FTY-720 treated control mice did not

256

develop EAE (Fig. 5b). Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood on day 12 post-

257

immunization with MOG peptide confirmed the FTY-720 treatment-induced leukopenia in

258

control and Pdgfbret/ret mice (Supplementary Fig. 5a-c). The brains and spinal cords of vehicle

259

treated mice were analyzed with FTY-720 treated mice on the same day for the presence of

260

immune cells when they reached termination criteria (ataxia score 8.5-10) using flow

261

cytometry. In parallel, the brain and spinal cords of control mice (EAE score 3-3.5) were

262

analyzed together with FTY-720 treated controls on the same day. As expected, FTY-720

263

treated animals had significantly lower numbers of CD45hi immune cells in the CNS both in

264

control and Pdgfbret/ret mice (Fig. 5c-f). In addition to reduced number of CD4+ and CD8+ T

265

cells, we also observed a reduction of myeloid cells (MdC and Ly6ChiMHC-II- cells) after FTY-

266

720 treatment in brains of Pdgfbret/ret mice (Fig. 5c-e). FTY-720 treatment after the induction

of EAE has been shown to reduce the number of circulating monocytes in addition to T-cells

Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the reduced infiltration of leukocytes into the brain

that the severe clinical phenotype of pericyte-deficient mice after induction of EAE is caused

Spontaneous neuroinflammation in Pdgfbret/ret mice expressing myelin specific T cell

276

receptor

277

Little is known about what triggers spontaneous activation and entry of self-reactive T cells

278

into the CNS. We asked whether the leukocyte permissive NVU in pericyte-deficient animals

279

leads to spontaneous neuroinflammation when there is an overabundance of self-reactive T-

280

cells towards a myelin antigen. To answer this question, we crossed Pdgfbret/ret mice with 2D2

281

mice, which express a MOG35-55 peptide specific T cell receptor (TCR) 21. Previous studies have

282

reported that approximately 5 % of 2D2 mice develop spontaneous EAE with classical

283

symptoms

284

weaning for signs of cerebellar ataxia and classical EAE. Similarly to previous observations

285

(Fig. 4b, 5b), all animals carrying two alleles of mutated Pdgfb (Pdgfbret/ret) presented with an

286

ataxia score 2, consisting of hindlimb clasping (score 1) and kyphosis (score 1) already at

287

weaning, which remained stable (Fig. 6a). However, Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2tg mice showed increasing

288

cerebellar ataxia scores compared to Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2neg mice (Fig. 6a). Other control mice

289

(Pdgfbwt/ret; 2D2neg, Pdgfbwt/ret; 2D2tg) occasionally received score 1, which was based on single

290

balance loss on the ledge test. Of note, the ataxia score of individual Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2tg mice

291

fluctuated over the monitored time-period. None of the mice developed signs of classical EAE.

292

Immunofluorescent staining of the brains of 3 months old Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2tg animals showed an

293

increased number of CD45hi positive cells in the brains compared to Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2neg mice

294

(Fig. 6b). Flow cytometry of the immune cells confirmed that the brains of Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2tg

295

mice contain a significantly higher number of CD45hi cells compared to Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2neg (Fig.

296

6c, d). Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2tg animals and all control animals were sacrificed for flow cytometry

297

when Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2tg animals had reached the ataxia score of 6-9. Interestingly, immune cell

298

infiltrates of Pdgfbret/ret and Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2tg consisted of MdCs, Ly6ChiMHC-II-, CD4+ and

299

CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2e and 6d). In the brains of Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2tg mice, in addition to the

aforementioned populations, neutrophils and B cells were detected (Fig. 6d). Spinal cords of

301

Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2tg mice did not show immune cell infiltrates (Supplementary Fig. 5) consistent

302

with the Pdgfbret/ret (Supplementary Fig. 1) or Pdgfbret/ret mice during EAE (Fig. 4e, h). Thus,

303

these experiments demonstrate that the leukocyte-permissive NVU caused by reduced pericyte

304

coverage promotes the development of a neuroinflammatory disorder associated with increased

305

myelin-reactive T cells in the circulation.

Discussion

308

Pericytes have been shown to regulate BBB integrity at the level of endothelial transcytosis 1,

309

2

310

control over other characteristics of the brain vasculature is less explored. In this study, we

311

investigated the role of pericytes in regulating leukocyte trafficking into adult CNS. In addition,

312

we show that in the absence of pericytes, the NVU becomes permissive to leukocyte entry,

313

leading to aggravated neuroinflammation in a setting of autoimmunity.

. Pericytes also induce polarization of astrocyte end-feet 1; however, the extent of pericyte

314

A previous study on pericyte-deficient Pdgfb-/- embryos showed that several LAMs, (e.g.

315

Icam1, Alcam, Lgals3) were significantly upregulated on brain vasculature 2. In addition, a

316

modest increase in Ly-6G/Ly-6C positive leukocytes was observed in the brains of juvenile

317

PdgfbF7/F7 mice that display a 50% reduction in pericyte coverage compared to controls 2. Our

318

observation that several LAMs, including VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, are upregulated in the adult

319

vasculature of Pdgfbret/ret mice (Fig. 1), which is accompanied by increased leukocyte entry into

320

the brain parenchyma (Fig. 2), corroborates and extends these findings. Of note, endothelial

321

cell-cell junctions in pericyte-deficient are closed to plasma proteins1, 2 indicating that increased

322

leukocyte entry into the brain in pericyte-deficient mice is not due to relaxed cell-cell junctions.

323

However, the molecular composition endothelial cell-cell contacts might be altered, which

324

might facilitate leukocyte transmigration.

325

Similar persistent inflammation in the absence of pericytes as in the brain vasculature in

326

Pdgfbret/ret mice has been described in the retina 22-25. Whether an acute drop-out of pericytes in

327

the adult organism leads to altered BBB permeability and alters the permissiveness of

328

vasculature to leukocyte trafficking needs further studies. Pericyte ablation in adult mice using

329

the Pdgfrb-Cre-ErT2; DTA mice was reported not to cause immediate BBB permeability

330

changes in the retina and brain

331

unpublished data show that using the Pdgfrb-Cre-ErT2; DTA approach is not effective to deplete

332

adult brain pericytes. In fact, only partial (up to 50 %) pericyte depletion could be achieved in

333

the hippocampus. In adult vasculature, which has established structural (e.g. basement

334

membrane) and cellular structures (e.g. astrocyte-end feet), pathological changes in the

335

vasculature upon pericyte loss develop gradually over a few weeks. Thus, extensive loss of

336

pericyte coverage during the formation of CNS vasculature results in sustained alterations at

337

the NVU as well as at the level of vessel permeability and permissiveness to leukocyte

338

trafficking, which cannot be corrected by other cellular constituents of the NVU. However,

339

CNS vasculature compensates to a certain extent for pericyte-loss and reduced pericyte

340

coverage. Upon a pericyte loss in the brain, the area covered by a single pericyte can be

341

compensated by spatial rearrangement of nearby pericytes

342

intravenous tracers in juvenile PdgfbF7/F7 and PdgfbF7/- mice that have a 50-60% reduction in

343

pericyte coverage is absent in adult animals 2. The loss of pericytes may be compensated by

344

other cells of the NVU such as astrocytes, which have been shown to promote BBB integrity

345

and CNS immune quiescence 27, 28. Previous studies have shown an inverse correlation between

346

pericyte coverage and BBB permeability in the brain 1, 2, 14. Based on previous data on pericyte-

347

deficient mice, up to 50 % reduction in pericyte vessel coverage does not lead to overt BBB

348

permeability changes (Fig. 7a). Notably, an increased infiltration of leukocytes into brain

349

parenchyma has been reported in mouse pups that express one allele of constitutively active

24

; however, pericyte loss in the brain was not assessed. Our

Increased infiltration of immune cells into the brain parenchyma in adult Pdgfbret/ret is not

accompanied by demyelination. This finding indicates that the permissive state of brain

355

vasculature to immune cell entry is not sufficient to trigger demyelinating CNS pathology.

356

Normal oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination of adult Pdgfbret/ret mice has also been

357

investigated 31. The findings of this study contradict a previous report of white matter changes

358

and loss of myelin in another mouse model of pericyte-deficiency – PdgfrbF7/F7 mice

359

However, several other studies have not found evidence that adult Pdgfrb mutants demonstrate

360

pericyte loss during aging or present altered BBB permeability

361

pericyte-like cells have been shown to proliferate and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation

362

during remyelination after acute CNS injury

Pdgfrb mutants could contribute to the reported white matter changes during aging (i.e.

Interestingly, we observed an increased number of CD11c+ DCs in the brain parenchyma

of adult Pdgfbret/ret mice. The presentation of CNS antigens by DCs leads to activation of

368

cells to initiate neuroinflammation

MOG35-55 specific TCR (Fig. 6 and Supplementary fig. 6, Fig. 7b).

376

Brain-restricted neuroinflammation in pericyte-deficient mice is dominated by myeloid

377

cells (CD11b+Ly6Chi) – approx. 87 % and 17 % of the parent population (CD45hiCD11b+Ly6G-

378

) in Pdgfbret/ret mice during EAE and in Pdgfbret/ret;2D2tg mice, respectively (Fig. 4f, g and Fig.

379

6c, d). Increasing evidence points to the key role of myeloid cell subsets in mediating tissue

380

damage in EAE and MS (reviewed in

381

signs and worsens the severity of EAE 40-42 43.

The localization of demyelinating lesions in MS patients shows a variable pattern. Typical

384

affected areas are cerebral white matter (e.g. periventricular, corpus callosum), brain stem and

385

cerebellum 44 as well as optic nerve and spinal cord. In the case of neuromyelitis optica spectrum

386

disorders, another type of autoimmune demyelinating disease, the optic nerve and spinal cord

387

are preferentially damaged. 45. In EAE, a “classical” spinal cord phenotype (ascending flaccid

388

paralysis) can be distinguished from “atypical“ EAE with inflammation localized to the

389

cerebrum, cerebellum and brain stem. The underlying mechanisms leading to regional

390

differences in leukocyte extravasation are not well understood. It has been suggested that brain

391

and spinal cord are distinct microenvironments with a distinct inflammatory cell repertoire,

including different T cell types and different cytokines

(Fig. 6a), milder than after the induction of EAE. Histological and flow cytometry analyses of

396

infiltrated immune cells, which showed neuroinflammation localized to the brain in pericyte-

404

BBB breakdown, one of the pathological hallmarks of MS 47, 48, is an early event in the

405

formation of the inflammatory lesions and has been suggested to precede parenchymal

406

inflammation 49. Interestingly, one of the early changes after induction of EAE, at the capillary

407

level, increased transcytosis of brain endothelial cells causing increased vessel permeability 50.

408

Pericyte damage (e.g. lipofuscin accumulation, membrane protrusions) in chronic-progressive

409

has been described in MS lesions51. It has been suggested that the BBB becomes disrupted by

early inflammatory microlesions via IL-1β

411

induction 53. However, the nature of changes at the NVU that precede immune cell entry and

412

cause failure of vascular the immune regulatory function in MS is not known. Our study shows

413

that intrinsic changes in brain vasculature facilitate the neuroinflammatory cascade and can

414

influence the localization of the neuroinflammatory lesions. In the future, it would be interesting

415

to investigate whether intrinsic changes in brain vasculature such as alterations in pericyte-

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that pericytes contribute to CNS immune

quiescence by limiting leukocyte infiltration into the CNS during homeostasis and autoreactive

neuroinflammation. In addition, immune cells preferentially home into CNS regions in which

421

vessels show a proinflammatory profile due to the dramatically reduced pericyte coverage. The

462

days overnight at 4˚C, afterwards with secondary antibody mix for 1 day overnight at 4˚C and

463

finally with DAPI (1:10000, Sigma-Aldrich) for 8 min at room temperature. Stained sections

464

were mounted with Mount Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen). The following

Images of immunofluorescently labeled sections were acquired by Leica SP5 confocal laser

485

scanning microscope (Leica microsystems, 20X objective, NA=0.7) equipped with HyD.

486

Pericyte coverage was calculated using the area measurement tool in Fiji. The area of CD13

487

and collagen-IV signal was measured on binary images in 6 ROIs, 150 x 150 µm each, in

488

coronal spinal cord sections. Coverage was calculated as the percentage of CD13 positive area

489

over the collagen-IV positive area. The collagen-IV area was taken arbitrarily as 100% and the

490

CD13 positive area was expressed as a percentage normalized to the collagen-IV area. VCAM-

491

1 and ICAM-1 vessel coverage was calculated using the area measurement tool in Fiji. The area

492

of VCAM-1 or ICAM-1 and the GLUT-1 signal (on VCAM-1 stained sections) or collagen-IV

493

signal (on ICAM-1 stained sections) was measured on binary images in 6 ROIs, 200 x 200 µm

494

each, in coronal brain sections. Coverage was calculated as the percentage of VCAM-1 or

495

ICAM-1 positive area over the GLUT-1 or collagen-IV positive area, respectively. The GLUT-

19 sections in the striatum and in 15 sections in the corpus callosum on horizontal brain sections.

504

A surface mask was added to the collagen-IV signal and the CD45 signal was marked using the

505

“spots” function in each ROI using Imaris x64 software. The total number of spots (CD45hi

506

cells) and number of spots not overlapping with the collagen-IV surface mask (extravasated

CD45hi cells) was calculated using the built-in statistics tool of Imaris x64 software. The

508

percentage of spots not overlapping with the collagen-IV surface mask to the total number of

Scoring of demyelination on LFB-PAS stained sections

527

Three LFB-PAS stained sections per animal were assessed for myelination. The scoring system

528

to assess demyelination was adopted from Kim et al.

529

corpus callosum were subjectively evaluated as follows: 0 - fully myelinated; 1 - mild

530

demyelination (≤1/3 affected) in the center; 2 - moderate demyelination (≤2/3 affected) in the

531

center; 3 - no myelin in the center; 4 - demyelination extending to the arch of the medial corpus

532

callosum. Demyelination scores for lateral projections of the corpus callosum were scored as

533

follows: a range from 0 to 3 was used, where 0 equals to normal myelination and 3 indicates no

601

The scoring of atypical EAE (cerebellar ataxia) symptoms was adopted from Guyenet et

602

al. 18. Following four individual parameters were scored - ledge test, hind limb clasping, gait

603

and kyphosis. Each individual measure was scored on a scale from 0 to 3 and recorded at the

604

end of the measurement as a combined score from 0 to 12. The scale for ledge test was assessed

605

as follows: 0 - the mouse is able to walk along the ledge without losing its balance and lands

606

on its paws when lowering itself back to the cage; 1 - the mouse is not able to walk along the

607

ledge without losing its footing, but otherwise walks coordinated; 2 - the mouse is not able to

608

effectively use its hind limbs while walking along the ledge and lands rather on its head then

609

its paws; 3 -: the mouse is completely unable to walk along the ledge or falls off. The scale for

610

the hind limb clasping was assessed as follows: 0 -upon lifting the mouse by its tail both of its

611

hind limbs are persistently pointing away from the abdomen; 1 - if one hind limb is pulled back

612

towards the abdomen for more than 50% of the time suspended; 2 - both hind limbs are partially

613

pulled back towards the abdomen for more than 50% of the time suspended; 3 - hind limbs are

614

entirely retracted and touching the abdomen for more than 50% of the time. The scale for gait

615

was assessment is as follows: 0 - the mouse walks coordinated, all four limbs support the body

616

weight evenly and its abdomen is not touching the ground; 1 - the mouse limps while walking

617

or tremor can be observed; 2 - the mouse has severe tremor or severe limp or lowered pelvis

618

and the feet are pointing away from the body (“duck feet”); 3 - the mouse has severe difficulties

619

to walk and the abdomen is completely touching the ground or it refuses to walk at all. The

620

scale for kyphosis was assessed as follows: 0 - the mouse can freely straighten its spine while

621

walking, no visible kyphosis; 1 - the mouse has a mild kyphosis but is able to straighten its

Pdgfbret/ret and control mice brain microvascular transcriptome data have been published

627

previously (GSE15892) 1. Normalized intensity values and meta data were obtained from Gene

628

Expression Omnibus, using the "GEOquery" package from Bioconductor 61. Probe annotation

629

data were obtained using the "mouse4302.db" package, also from Bioconductor 62. Probe-level

630

intensity values were summarized at the gene-level using the collapseRows functionality within

631

the WGCNA R package 63. If a gene symbol was associated with more than one probe id, the

632

probe id showing maximum variation was kept for downstream analyses. Differential

633

expression summary statistics were computed using the empirical Bayes approach implemented

634

with the "limma" package from Bioconductor 64. Heatmap visualizing the expression pattern of

coverage less than 10-15% during development results in premature death. (b) Pericytes

772

regulate organ specific characteristics of the CNS vasculature. Previous studies have shown that

773

pericytes regulate the BBB permeability on the level of endothelial transcytosis

774

polarization of astrocyte end-feet 1. Of note, pericytes do not regulate expression of ABC

775

transporters 1. Accordingly, increased BBB permeability to plasma proteins is not paralleled by

776

increased transport of small-molecular drugs 67. Our study corroborates pervious data showing

777

an increased expression of LAMs upon the absence of pericytes 2. Poor pericyte coverage in

778

adult mice results in the loss of zonated expression and upregulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1

779

on blood vessels which licences entry of dendritic cells (DC), monocyte-derived cells (MdC)

780

and T cells into the CNS, which upon the induction of neuroinflammation aggravates the

781

disease and determines the anatomical location of immune cell infiltrates.
