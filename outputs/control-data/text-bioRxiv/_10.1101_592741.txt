damage repair. Aberrations in 3D chromatin conformation have been implicated in

36

developmental abnormalities and cancer. Despite the importance of 3D chromatin conformation

37

to cellular function and human health, little is known about how 3D chromatin conformation

38

varies in the human population, or whether DNA sequence variation between individuals

39

influences 3D chromatin conformation. To address these questions, we performed Hi-C on

40

Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) from 20 individuals. We identified thousands of regions

41

across the genome where 3D chromatin conformation varies between individuals and found that

42

this conformational variation is often accompanied by variation in gene expression, histone

43

modifications, and transcription factor (TF) binding. Moreover, we found that DNA sequence

44

variation influences several features of 3D chromatin conformation including loop strength,

45

contact insulation, contact directionality and density of local cis contacts. We mapped hundreds

46

of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with 3D chromatin features and found evidence that

47

some of these same variants are associated at modest levels with other molecular phenotypes

48

as well as complex disease risk. Our results demonstrate that common DNA sequence variants

49

can influence 3D chromatin conformation, pointing to a more pervasive role for 3D chromatin

50

conformation in human phenotypic variation than previously recognized.

INTRODUCTION

53
54

3-dimensional (3D) organization of chromatin is essential for proper regulation of gene

55

expression1-3, and plays an important role in other nuclear processes including DNA

56

replication4,5, X chromosome inactivation6-9, and DNA repair10,11. Many recent insights about 3D

57

chromatin conformation have been enabled by a suite of technologies based on Chromatin

58

Conformation Capture (3C)12. A high-throughput version of 3C called “Hi-C” enables the

59

mapping of 3D chromatin conformation at genome-wide scale13, and has revealed several key

60

features of 3D chromatin conformation including: 1) compartments (often referred to as “A/B

61

compartments”), which refer to the tendency of loci with similar transcriptional activity to

62

physically segregate in 3D space13-15, 2) chromatin domains (often referred to as Topologically

63

Associating Domains, or TADs) demarcated by sharp boundaries across which contacts are

64

relatively infrequent16-18, 3) chromatin loops, which describe point-to-point interactions that occur

65

more frequently than would be expected based on the linear distance between interacting loci,

66

and often anchored by convergent CTCF motif pairs14, and 4) Frequently Interacting Regions

67

(FIREs), which are regions of increased local interaction frequency enriched for tissue-specific

68

genes and enhancers19,20.

69

Previous studies have used Hi-C to profile 3D chromatin conformation across different

70

cell types14,16,21, different primary tissues19, different cell states22, and in response to different

71

genetic and molecular perturbations23-27, producing a wealth of knowledge about key features of

72

3D chromatin conformation. However, to our knowledge no study to date has measured

73

variation in 3D chromatin conformation across more than a handful of unrelated individuals.

74

Several observations demonstrate that at least in some cases DNA sequence variation between

75

individuals can alter 3D chromatin organization with pathological consequences28. Pioneering

76

work by Mundlos and colleagues described several cases in which rearrangements of TAD

77

structure lead to gene dysregulation and consequent developmental malformations29,30. In

78

cancer, somatic mutations and aberrant DNA methylation can disrupt TAD boundaries leading

79

to dysregulation of proto-oncogenes31,32. Moreover, many genetic variants associated with

80

human traits by GWAS occur in distal regulatory elements that loop to putative target gene

81

promoters in 3D, and in some cases, the strength of these looping interactions has been shown

82

to vary between alleles of the associated SNP33,34. Although these studies demonstrate that that

83

both large effects as well as more subtle aberrations of 3D chromatin conformation are potential

84

mechanisms of disease, population-level variation in 3D chromatin conformation more broadly

85

has remained unexplored.

86

In the present study, we set out to characterize inter-individual variation in 3D chromatin

87

conformation by performing Hi-C on Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) derived from individuals

88

whose genetic variation has been cataloged by the HapMap or 1000 Genomes Consortia35.

89

LCLs have been used as a model system to study variation in several other molecular

90

phenotypes including gene expression, histone modifications, transcription factor (TF) binding,

91

and chromatin accessibility36-42. These previous efforts provide a rich context to explore variation

92

in 3D chromatin conformation identified in this model system. Through integrative analyses, we

93

found that inter-individual variation in 3D chromatin conformation occurs on many levels

94

including compartments, TAD boundary strengths, FIREs, and looping interaction strengths.

95

Moreover, we found that variation in 3D chromatin conformation coincides with variation in

96

activity of the underlying genome sequence as evidenced by transcription, histone

97

modifications, and TF binding. Although our sample size is small, we observe reproducible

98

effects of DNA sequence variation on 3D chromatin conformation and identify hundreds of

99

Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with multiple features of 3D chromatin conformation.

100

Our results demonstrate that variation in 3D chromatin conformation is readily detectable from

101

Hi-C data, often overlaps with regions of transcriptomic and epigenomic variability, and is

102

influenced in part by genetic variation that may contribute to disease risk.

RESULTS

105
106

Mapping 3D chromatin conformation across individuals

107
108

To generate maps of 3D chromatin conformation suitable for comparison across

109

individuals, we performed “dilution” Hi-C on LCLs derived from 13 Yoruban individuals (including

110

one trio), one Puerto Rican trio, and one Han Chinese trio (19 individuals total; Supplemental

111

Table 1). We also include published Hi-C data from one European LCL (GM12878) generated

112

previously by our group using the same protocol43, for a total of 20 individuals from four different

113

populations. Many of these same LCLs have been used in previous genomic studies38,40,42,

114

allowing us to leverage multiple transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets in our analysis below

115

(Supplemental Table 2). Importantly, 18 of these individuals have had their genetic variation

116

cataloged by the 1000 Genomes Consortium35,44 (Supplemental Table 1), which allowed us to

117

examine the influence of genetic variation on 3D chromatin conformation. Two replicates of Hi-C

118

were performed on each LCL, with each replicate performed on cells grown independently in

119

culture for at least two passages (Supplemental Table 3).

120

All Hi-C data were processed using a uniform pipeline that incorporates the WASP

121

approach40,45 to eliminate allelic mapping biases (see methods section 2a). For each sample,

122

we mapped a series of well-established Hi-C-derived features including 40Kb resolution contact

123

matrices, Directionality Index (DI)16, Insulation score (INS)7, and compartmentalization13 (Figure

124

1a; Supplemental Figure 1a-c). Compartmentalization is measured by the first Principal

125

Component (PC1) of Hi-C contact matrices, and thus we use the acronym “PC1” below to refer

126

to this measure of compartmentalization. We also identified regions known as Frequently

127

Interacting Regions (FIREs)19 and their corresponding “FIRE scores”, which measure how

128

frequently a given region interacts with its neighboring regions (15~200kb). The concept of FIRE

129

is based on the observation that the frequency of contacts at this distance is not evenly

130

distributed across the genome, but rather, tends to peak in regions showing epigenomic

131

signatures of transcriptional and regulatory activity (Supplemental Figure 2). As we have shown

132

previously19,20, FIRE regions often overlap putative enhancer elements (Supplemental Figure

133

1d-e). We did not call “chromatin loops” in this study because our data was not of sufficient

134

resolution, but we use a set of loops called previously in the LCL GM1287814 to examine

135

variation in loop strength among the LCLs in our study. Aggregate analysis shows that these

136

published LCL loops are generally reproduced in our data (Supplemental Figure 3).

137
138

3D chromatin conformation variations between individuals

139
140

After uniformly processing all Hi-C data (see methods section 2), we compared

141

chromatin conformation across LCLs at the level of contact matrices and multiple derived

142

features (PC1, DI, INS, and FIRE). From a genome-wide perspective, each of these 3D

143

chromatin features shows a signature consistent with reproducible inter-individual variation

144

whereby replicates from the same individual (i.e. same LCL) are more highly correlated than

145

datasets from different individuals (PC1 p=2.4e-7, INS p=1.6e-7, DI p=3.3e-7, FIRE p=0.0157

146

by Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 1b-d, Supplemental Figure 4a-f). The Hi-C data also cluster

147

by population (Supplemental Figure 4f-g) consistent with an influence from genetic background,

148

but we note that this population-level clustering can be caused by other factors such as batch of

149

sample acquisition46.

150

Despite generally high correlations of Hi-C data across individuals, we frequently

151

observed regions where 3D chromatin conformation varies reproducibly between individuals

152

(example shown in Figure 2a, Supplemental Figure 5a). To more systematically identify regions

153

of variable 3D chromatin conformation, we used the “limma” package47 to identify regions where

154

variation between individuals was more significant than variation between two replicates from

155

the same individual. We applied this approach to DI, INS, FIRE, and PC1. For each metric, we

156

first defined a set of testable 40kb bins across the genome by filtering out bins with low levels of

157

signal across all individuals or near structural variants that can appear as aberrations in Hi-C

158

maps48 (see methods section 4a). We then applied a False Discovery Rate (FDR) threshold of

159

0.1 and merged neighboring variable bins, resulting in the identification of 2,318 variable DI

160

regions, 2,485 variable INS regions, 1,996 variable FIRE regions, and 7,732 variable PC1

161

regions (Figure 2b, Supplemental Table 4, Supplemental Figure 5b). We note that there is

162

strong overlap between the variable DI, INS, FIRE, and PC1 regions detected across all 20

163

LCLs and those detected using only the 11 unrelated YRI LCLs, which suggests that potential

164

confounding effects of variation between different populations are not driving the identification of

165

these variable regions (Supplemental Figure 5c). Although each metric has a unique set of

166

testable bins, we found significant enrichment for bins that are variable in more than one metric

167

(Figure 2c, Supplemental Figure 5d-e), indicating that the same regions often vary across

168

multiple features of 3D chromatin conformation.

169

We next used Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) to examine whether variable

170

regions detected by Hi-C are consistent with distance measurements from imaging data (Figure
5

171

2d-e). Focusing on a variable DI region on chromosome 15 (chr15:96720000-96920000; hg19),

172

we performed FISH in LCLs from four individuals with different levels of DI at the variable region

173

being evaluated (YRI-3, YRI-4, YRI-5, YRI-8).

174

respectively to the variable DI region (“center”, probe covers chr15:96715965-96898793), a

175

region approximately 668Kb upstream (“upstream”, probe covers chr15:95897555-96047720),

176

or a region approximately 590Kb downstream (“downstream”, probe covers chr15:97488414-

177

97648104). We found that distances between the center probe and these flanking probes vary

178

significantly between individuals with strong upstream contact bias as measured by DI (YRI-4,

179

YRI-8) and individuals without this upstream contact bias (YRI-3, YRI-5)(Figure 2d-e, center-

180

upstream distance p=0.017, center-downstream distance p=1.7e-5 by Wilcoxon rank sum test).

181

Moreover, we found that the center probe is closer to the upstream than the downstream probe

182

in the two individuals with strong upstream DI signal at the central variable DI region (p=3.2e-3

183

for YRI-3, p=1.5e-4 for YRI-5 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). However, this trend is reversed in

184

individuals without upstream DI signal where the center probe is now closer to the downstream

185

probe (p=0.021 for YRI-4, p=0.1 for YRI-8 by Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Supplemental Figure

186

6a).

We used three BAC probes that hybridize

187

We also sought to identify variable entries in the Hi-C contact matrix itself (“matrix cells”).

188

To facilitate this search, we used a method called Bandwise Normalization and Batch Correction

189

(BNBC) that we recently developed to normalize Hi-C data across individuals (Fletez-Brant et al.

190

Pre-print: https://doi.org/10.1101/214361). BNBC takes contact distance into account as a co-

191

variate because batch effects in Hi-C data can be distance-dependent. To identify variable

192

matrix cells, we performed a variance decomposition on Hi-C contact matrix cells which

193

exhibited statistically-significant variability between individuals, resulting in a measure of

194

biological variability for each bin in the contact matrix (see example in Figure 2a and

195

Supplemental Figure 5a). To identify matrix cells with significant levels of biological variability,

196

we estimated FDR using the IHW framework49 to include the distance between anchor bins as

197

an informative covariate. At an FDR threshold of 0.1, we identified 115,817 matrix cells showing

198

significant variability between samples (Supplemental Table 5). These variable bins are heavily

199

skewed toward shorter contact distances (Figure 2f, Supplemental Figure 6b), likely due in part

200

to higher read counts and thus increased power at these distances. We observed that the

201

anchor regions of variable matrix cells overlap with variable regions of DI, INS, FIRE, and PC1

202

more often than would be expected by chance (Figure 2g; Supplemental Figure 6c). We also

203

observed that variable matrix cells tend to occur in groups (Figures 2a, 3a), suggesting that

204

variation in 3D chromatin conformation often affects more than one adjacent genomic window.

205
206

Coordinated variation of the 3D genome, epigenome, and transcriptome

207
208

To investigate the relationship between variation in 3D chromatin conformation and gene

209

regulation, we analyzed multiple published datasets including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and DNase-

210

seq data generated from some of the same LCLs in our study (Supplemental Table 2).

211

Strikingly, for all external datasets examined here, we see an enrichment for regions at which

212

3D chromatin conformation across individuals is correlated with measures of genome activity in

213

the same 40Kb bin (see example in Figure 3a and Supplemental Figure 7a). To assign a level of

214

statistical significance to these observations, we approximated the null distribution by randomly

215

permuting the sample labels of external datasets, thus disrupting the link between Hi-C and

216

ChIP/RNA/DNase-seq data from the same individual, but not changing the underlying data

217

structure (see schematic in Supplemental Figure 7b). We used these permutations to calculate

218

the bootstrap p-values in Figure 3b. Among variable PC1 regions, we observed a significant

219

enrichment for regions at which PC1 values across individuals are positively correlated with

220

histone modifications indicative of transcriptional activity including H3K27ac (bootstrap

221

P<0.001), H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 (but notably less so with H3K27me3, which is marker of

222

transcriptional repression) (bootstrap P<0.001 for all histone modifications, Figure 3b). The

223

correlations between PC1 and marks of transcriptional activity occur in the expected direction --

224

i.e. higher PC1 values are associated with higher gene expression and more active histone

225

modifications. Similar correlations were apparent in two distinct sets of ChIP-seq data generated

226

by different groups40,42, and observed whether we use variable regions identified across all 20

227

LCLs or only across the 11 unrelated YRI LCLs (Supplemental Figure 7c).

228

The relationship between variation in 3D chromatin conformation and underlying

229

genome activity extends beyond A/B compartmentalization. At variable FIRE regions, we found

230

an abundance of regions where FIRE score is positively correlated with marks of cis-regulatory

231

activity including H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (Bootstrap P<0.001; Figure 3b, Supplemental Figure

232

9a), consistent with the previously reported relationship between FIREs and cis-regulatory

233

activity19,20. DI and INS values at variable regions tend to be correlated histone modification

234

levels as well as CTCF and Cohesin subunit SA1 binding (Bootstrap P<0.001; Figure 3b,

235

Supplemental Figure 8a-b), which are known to influence these 3D chromatin features16,50,51.

236

For INS, the relationship is directional such that higher CTCF/Cohesin binding corresponds to

237

more contact insulation (i.e. lower INS score). However, at variable DI regions the correlations

238

are not as clearly directional, reflecting current understanding that the direction of DI (i.e.
7

239

upstream vs downstream contact bias) is arbitrary relative to strength of CTCF/Cohesin binding.

240

We performed similar analysis on variable cells in the contact matrix, and found that the

241

interaction frequency in these matrix cells across individuals tends to be correlated with

242

epigenetic or transcriptional properties of one or both corresponding “anchor” bins (Bootstrap

243

P<0.001; Figure 3b, Supplemental Figure 9b). Importantly, for all types of variable regions

244

examined here we found correlation with RNA-seq signal, indicating that at least at some

245

regions, variation in 3D chromatin features accompanies variation in gene expression.

246

We examined further whether 3D chromatin conformation at a given variable region

247

tends to be correlated with only one epigenomic property, or with several properties

248

simultaneously. We found that PC1, FIRE, INS, and DI values across individuals are often

249

correlated with multiple features of active regions (e.g. H3K27ac, H3K4me1, RNA), and anti-

250

correlated with the repressive H3K27me3 histone modification (Figure 3c,d). For DI, where

251

direction is not as clearly linked to magnitude of gene regulatory activity, we note a larger set of

252

regions with anti-correlation to features of active regions (e.g. H3K27ac, H3K4me1, RNA) and

253

positive correlation with H3K27me3 (Figure 3e,f). These results demonstrate that variation in 3D

254

chromatin conformation is often accompanied by variation in transcriptional and regulatory

255

activity of the same region. Moreover, the correlations between multiple molecular phenotypes

256

at the same region suggest that shared mechanism(s) underlie variation in these phenotypes

257

across individuals.

258
259

Genetic loci influencing 3D chromatin conformation

260
261

To examine genetic influence on 3D chromatin conformation we first considered genetic

262

variants overlapping CTCF motifs at chromatin loop anchors14, because disruption of these

263

CTCF motifs by genome engineering has been shown to alter chromatin looping23. Focusing on

264

SNPs at variation-intolerant positions in anchor CTCF motifs (“anchor disrupting SNPs”, at

265

sequence weight matrix positions where a single base has a probability of >0.75, Figure 4a), we

266

observed a significant linear relationship between SNP genotype and the strength of

267

corresponding loops (p=7.6e-5 by linear regression; Figure 4b,c). We also examined whether

268

individuals heterozygous for anchor disrupting SNPs showed allelic imbalance in loop strength.

269

To facilitate this analysis, we used the HaploSeq43 method to generate chromosome-span

270

haplotype blocks for each LCL (Supplemental Table 6). Although few Hi-C read pairs overlap a

271

SNP allowing haplotype assignment (mean 7.89% of usable reads per LCL), we do observe that

272

the haplotype bearing the stronger motif allele tends to show more reads connecting the

273

corresponding loop anchors (p=5.9e-4 by one-sided t-test of mean > 0.5; Figure 4d). Our

274

observation that CTCF motif SNPs can modulate 3D chromatin conformation is consistent with

275

similar findings reported from ChIA-PET data52, and a recent report of haplotype-associate

276

chromatin loop published while this manuscript was in preparation27.

277

Motivated by these preliminary observations of genetic effects on 3D chromatin

278

conformation, we next searched directly for QTLs associated with Hi-C derived features of 3D

279

chromatin conformation. Power calculations indicated that, despite limited sample size, we were

280

moderately powered to find QTLs with strong effect sizes using a linear mixed effect model

281

(LMM) approach that takes advantage of the Hi-C replicates for each LCL (Supplemental Table

282

7). Thus, we conducted a targeted search for QTLs associated with variation in FIRE, DI, INS,

283

and contact frequency. We did not include PC1 in the QTL search because we reasoned that

284

individual genetic variants would be more likely to have detectable effects on local chromatin

285

conformation rather than large-scale features like compartmentalization. For this same reason,

286

we used modified versions of DI and INS scores for the QTL search calculated with a window

287

size of 200Kb upstream and downstream of the target bin, rather than the standard 2Mb window

288

size for DI16 or 480Kb for INS47. We also limited our QTL searches to the 11 unrelated YRI

289

individuals in our study (referred to below as the “discovery set”) to mitigate potential

290

confounding differences between populations.

291

For each 3D genome phenotype under study we identified a list of testable bins that

292

showed appreciable levels of signal in at least one individual in our discovery set (see methods

293

section 7 for full description of test bin and SNP selection). We also identified a set of test SNPs

294

that includes at most one tag SNP among those in perfect LD in each 40Kb bin. Response

295

variables (i.e. 3D chromatin phenotype values) were quantile normalized across the discovery

296

set. For each testable bin, we measured the association of the given 3D chromatin phenotype

297

with all test SNPs in that bin. In cases where multiple SNPs in the same bin were significantly

298

associated with the phenotype we selected only the most significantly associated SNP per bin

299

for our final QTL list. Ultimately, at an FDR of 0.2, we identified 387 FIRE-QTLs (i.e. testable

300

bins in which FIRE score is associated with at least one SNPs in that bin; comprising 6.6% of

301

tested bins), 545 DI-QTLs (4.2% of tested bins), and 911 INS-QTLs (12.0% of tested

302

bins)(Figure 4e, Supplemental Figure 10a, Supplemental Table 8). For analysis of DI-QTLs, we

303

separated the testable bins into those with upstream bias and those with downstream bias (see

304

methods section 7d), because we observed a Simpson's paradox when we analyzed the

305

genotype trend at all DI-QTL regions together (Supplemental figure 10b).

306

We also searched for QTLs associated directly with interaction frequency in individual

307

contact matrix cells using an LMM approach like that described above for FIRE, DI, and INS.

308

The large number of cells in a Hi-C contact matrix, together with limited sample size, made a

309

true genome-wide QTL search unfeasible. However, power calculations indicated that if we

310

limited our QTL search to a subset of cells in the matrix we could have moderate power to

311

detect strong genetic signals (Supplemental Table 7). Thus, we limited our QTL search for

312

contact matrix QTLs (“C-QTLs”) to matrix cells that showed significant biological variability in our

313

samples, as described above. We tested for association in our discovery set between the

314

BNBC-normalized interaction frequency in these variable matrix cells and the genotype of test

315

SNPs in either of the two anchor bins. We selected at most one QTL SNP per matrix cell, using

316

association p-value to prioritize, finally yielding 345 C-QTL SNPs associated with 463 matrix

317

cells at an IHW-FDR threshold of 0.2 (Figure 4f, Supplemental Table 8).

318

To evaluate the reproducibility of each of these QTLs sets (FIRE-QTLs, DI-QTLs, INS-

319

QTLs, and C-QTLs), we examined Hi-C data from 6 individuals who were not included in our

320

discovery set (we refer to these 6 individuals our “validation set”; Supplemental Table 1). These

321

individuals represent four different populations (CEU, PUR, CHS, YRI), and they include a child

322

of two individuals in the discovery set (YRI-13/NA19240 is child of YRI-11/NA19238 and YRI-

323

12/NA19239). In each case, we find a significant linear relationship in the validation set between

324

QTL genotype and the corresponding 3D chromatin phenotype (p=1.8e-14 for FIRE-QTLs,

325

p=2.5e-7 for DI-QTLs at positive DI bins, p=0.008 for DI-QTLs at negative DI bins, p=3e-4 for

326

INS-QTLs, p=4.1e-9 for C-QTLs; Figure 4g). To provide an additional and more stringent

327

estimate of the significance of these observations, we performed permutations by randomly

328

selecting sets of test SNPs and measuring the linear relationship between genotype and

329

phenotype in the validation set. In all cases, the observed relationship was also significant by

330

this more conservative bootstrap approach (p<0.001 for FIRE-QTLs, p<0.001 for DI-QTLs at

331

positive DI bins, p=0.041 for DI-QTLs at negative DI bins, p=0.005 for INS-QTLs, p=0.006 for C-

332

QTLs; Figure 4h).

333

There is little direct overlap between our different QTL sets (Supplemental figure 10c),

334

likely due to limited power and the fact that the testable bins were different for each metric.

335

However, we observed genotype-dependent INS score at FIRE-QTLs and C-QTLs, and

336

genotype-dependent FIRE score at INS-QTLs and DI-QTLs (Supplemental Figure 10d), which

337

suggested that overlapping signal between different types of 3D chromatin QTLs in present

338

below the level of test-wide significance. To more rigorously assess overlapping signal between

339

our QTL sets we examined shared association below the threshold of multiple test correction,

340

inspired by similar approaches reported elsewhere53. Our underlying hypothesis is that genetic

341

association studies of two different phenotypes “X” and “Y” with overlapping (or partially

342

overlapping) genetic architecture may have few direct overlaps between significant hits due to

343

limited power or differing study designs, but the shared signal should become apparent when

344

the full range of association results are considered. To quantify this, we calculated the fraction

345

of QTLs for a given phenotype X that exceed a nominal level of significance (p < 0.05) when

346

tested for association with a different phenotype Y. We refer to this value as the “nominal

347

fraction” below and in figure 4i. To test whether the nominal fraction of X-QTLs was significantly

348

higher than would be expected by chance, we approximated the null distribution by calculating

349

nominal fractions for 10,000 sets of SNPs selected randomly from among all X test SNPs. In

350

almost all pairwise comparisons between 3D chromatin QTL types examined here, we find that

351

the observed nominal fractions are significantly higher than would be expected in the absence

352

of shared genetic architecture (Figure 4i,j).

353
354

Contribution of 3D chromatin QTLs to molecular phenotypes and disease risk

355
356

Given the correlation observed between 3D chromatin variation and epigenome

357

variation, we next investigated whether 3D chromatin QTLs could modulate both the epigenome

358

and 3D genome. Here, we made use of published ChIP-seq data for histone modifications

359

(H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac) in a large set of 65 YRI LCLs39, DNase-seq data from 59 YRI

360

LCLs38, and CTCF ChIP-seq data from 15 CEU LCLs54. Notably, most individuals in these

361

datasets were not included in our QTL discovery or validation sets (54/65 for histone

362

modification ChIP-seq, 48/59 for DNase-seq, 15/15 for CTCF ChIP-seq). In many cases, we

363

found a significant linear relationship between 3D chromatin QTL genotypes and these different

364

epigenetic phenotypes (Figure 5a, Supplemental figure 11a). For example, at FIRE-QTLs, the

365

high-FIRE allele is also associated with higher levels of active histone modifications and

366

chromatin accessibility (Figure 5a). We note that although these associations are all significant

367

by linear regression, only H3K27ac and H3K4me1 passed more conservative permutation

368

testing in which the null distribution is approximated by selecting random SNPs from the full set

369

of tested SNPs (Figure 5b). At C-QTLs, the high-contact alleles show higher levels of the

370

enhancer-associated mark H3K4me1 in the two anchor bins that connect the corresponding

371

matrix cell. Moreover, the nominal fraction of C-QTLs (i.e. fraction of c-QTLs with p<0.05) in a

372

published set of H3K4me1-QTLs is significantly higher than expected in the absence of shared

373

genetic association (p=6.9e-6 by chi square test, bootstrap p=0.028; Supplemental Figure

374

11b,d). At INS-QTLs, the slope of these genotype-phenotype relationships is inverted such that

375

higher levels of histone modifications and chromatin accessibility are associated with the low

376

INS score allele (i.e. more contact insulation), although only the association with chromatin

377

accessibility is significant by both linear regression and permutation test (p=1.6e-40 by linear

378

regression, bootstrap p=0.023; Supplemental Figure 11b,d). The genotype-phenotype

379

relationships observed at DI-QTLs are not as clear as for other metrics (Figure 5b,

380

Supplemental figure 11a), but this is expected because increased histone modifications or

381

chromatin accessibility can influence DI in either direction, potentially confounding this type of

382

aggregate analysis. Anecdotally, we do observe examples of individual DI-QTLs where

383

genotype appears to correlate with epigenomic phenotype (Figure 5c).

384

Finally, we sought to examine whether 3D chromatin QTLs might contribute risk for

385

complex diseases. There are 44 direct overlaps between our 3D chromatin QTLs (or SNPs in

386

perfect LD in the same 40Kb bin) and NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog55 (Supplemental Table 9).

387

However, the significance of these direct overlaps is hard to assess given the differences

388

between the populations and study designs in question. Thus, here again we examined

389

overlaps below the level of genome-wide significance by looking at nominal fractions to assess

390

shared signal between association studies. We compiled full summary statistics for large GWAS

391

(>50,000 individuals) of the related immune-relevant phenotypes Crohn’s Disease (CD),

392

Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)56, as well as studies of the non-

393

immune phenotypes height57 and Body Mass Index (BMI)58. We observed striking enrichments

394

for INS-QTLs among variants with nominal associations to UC and IBD risk (1.67- and 1.65-fold,

395

respectively), and these enrichments are significant by both chi square and permutation tests

396

(INS-QTL with UC chi square p=2.5e-16 and bootstrap p=0.024; INS-QTL with IBD chi square

397

p=5.5e-17 and bootstrap p=0.018; Figure 5d,e). We also note a trend in which FIRE-QTLs show

398

nominal association with UC and IBD (1.36- and 1.58-fold enrichment, respectively), although

399

these observations fall just below the threshold of significance by the more stringent

400

permutation test (FIRE-QTL with UC chi square p= 7.6e-6 and bootstrap p=0.090; FIRE-QTL

401

with IBD chi square p= 4.2e-8 and bootstrap p=0.056; Figure 5d,f).

DISCUSSION

404
405

Our results provide the first systematic characterization of how chromatin conformation

406

varies between unrelated individuals at the population level, and as a consequence of genetic

407

variation. The most important finding of our study is that genetic variation influences multiple

408

features of 3D chromatin conformation, and does so to an extent that is detectable even with

409

limited sample size and Hi-C resolution. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first

410

report of QTLs directly associated with 3D chromatin conformation. However, there are

411

limitations to our QTL search that are important to note here. First, the small sample size means

412

that our power to detect QTLs is limited, and in order to identify QTL sets that could be analyzed

413

in aggregate we tolerated elevated type I error by using an FDR threshold of 0.2 (as done

414

previously for molecular QTL studies with limited power40). Second, the limited resolution of our

415

Hi-C data (40Kb) and extensive LD in our study population prevented us from identifying

416

specific causal variant(s) for validation through genetic perturbation experiments. Nonetheless,

417

we were able to validate the 3D chromatin QTL sets through aggregate analysis of Hi-C data

418

from a small set of individuals who were not included in the QTL search, and with independently

419

generated ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data from a larger set of individuals. Taken together, our

420

results show that genetic variation influences several features of 3D chromatin conformation,

421

which is an important step forward to evaluate the role of 3D chromatin conformation in

422

mediating disease risk.

423

Another key finding of our study is that regions which vary in 3D chromatin conformation

424

across individuals also tend to vary in measures of transcriptional and regulatory activity. This

425

supports the existence of shared mechanisms that underlie variation in 3D chromatin

426

conformation, transcription, and epigenomic properties. We suspect that no single mechanism

427

or causal hierarchy applies to all regions of the genome with variation in one or more of these

428

properties. However, in at least some cases, this shared mechanism is likely genetic. This

429

raises the question of whether 3D chromatin QTLs are fundamentally the same as QTLs

430

previously described for other molecular phenotypes (e.g. eQTLs, dsQTLs, histoneQTLs;

431

collectively referred to below as “molQTLs”), or represent a separate set of QTLs not detectable

432

with other methods. This question is difficult to answer in the present study for two main

433

reasons: 1) Our power is limited and thus we cannot say with confidence that a given SNP is not

434

a 3D chromatin QTL. Many molQTL studies also have limited power and are thus prone to type

435

II error. 2) Our QTL searches, like most molQTL studies, are not truly genome-wide because

436

subsets of testable regions and testable SNPs are preselected to focus the search space.

437

These selection criteria can differ widely between studies, making direct QTL-to-QTL

438

comparisons challenging. The observation of genotype dependent epigenetic signal at 3D

439

chromatin QTLs suggest that at least some 3D chromatin QTLs could also be detected as other

440

types of molQTLs if those studies had sufficient statistical power. However, the limited overlap

441

between 3D chromatin QTLs and published molQTLs (even when considering SNPs with only a

442

nominal level of significance) points to a lack of power in current studies, and suggests further

443

that the QTLs with largest effects on 3D chromatin conformation are not necessarily the same

444

as those with large effects on other molecular phenotypes, and vice versa. Therefore, it is likely

445

that QTL studies directed toward different types of molecular phenotypes (including 3D

446

chromatin features) are likely to be complimentary rather than redundant.

447

Future studies with higher resolution Hi-C data and larger sample sizes will be important

448

to identify functional variants modulating 3D chromatin conformation, and to further dissect the

449

mechanistic relationships between genetics, 3D chromatin conformation, and other molecular

450

phenotypes. We anticipate that these studies will continue to reveal cases in which perturbation

451

of 3D chromatin conformation is a molecular mechanism through which disease-associated

452

genetic variants confer disease risk. The present study provides initial discoveries of genetic

453

influence on 3D chromatin conformation and an analytical framework and that we believe will

454

facilitate future efforts to unravel the molecular basis of genetic disease risk.

signal in the 40Kb QTL bin from individuals with the low signal genotype, medium signal

562

genotype, and high signal genotype, respectively. (h) Results of permutation test to evaluate the

563

statistical significance of results in (g). The solid vertical lines show the estimated linear

571

indicate the median and middle 95% range, respectively, of 10,000 permutations in which SNPs

572

were selected from the “foreground, tested” set. The number to the right of each line indicates

METHODS

762
763

1. Hi-C data generation. Hi-C was performed as previously described13. We note that all Hi-C

764

experiments were performed using a “dilution” HindIII protocol, rather than the newer “in situ”

765

version of the protocol, for consistency because data generation began before the invention of

766

in situ Hi-C. In addition, the resolution of 40kb used here for most analysis was determined

767

primarily by sequencing depth rather than choice of a restriction enzyme. Thus, even if a 4-

768

cutter like MboI had been used, the prohibitive cost of sequencing would have prevented us

769

taking advantage of the additional possible resolution.

770
771

2. Hi-C data processing.

772

2.a. Alignment with WASP. Read ends were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using

773

BWA-MEM63 v0.7.8 as single-end reads with the following parameters: -L 13,13. We used the

774

WASP pipeline40,45 to control for potential allelic mapping biases, which some modifications to

775

account for unique aspects of Hi-C data. BWA-MEM can produce split alignments where

776

different parts of a read are aligned to different parts of the genome. This is critical for Hi-C data,

777

because a read can span a Hi-C ligation junction between two interacting fragments. In the case

778

of a split alignment, BWA-MEM will mark the higher-scoring alignment as the primary alignment.
23

aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

779

For Hi-C data this is not ideal – we want the five-prime-most alignment (before the ligation

780

junction) to be the primary alignment. To account for this, we further processed the alignments

781

from BWA-MEM to select the five-prime-most alignment in cases where one read was split.

782

Reads without an alignment to the five-prime end of the read were filtered out, as were

783

alignments with low mapping quality (<10). The WASP pipeline was then used to generate

784

alternative reads by flipping the allele in reads overlapping SNPs, and these reads were then

785

realigned using the same pipeline. As input to WASP, we included all SNPs and indels present

786

in the PUR individuals in our set (HG00731, 732, 733), CHS individuals in 1000 genomes (we

787

included all CHS to account for the fact that no 1000 genomes genotype calls were available for

788

HG00514), YRI individuals in 1000 genomes (we included all YRI individuals to account for the

789

fact that no 1000 genomes genotype calls were available for GM19193), and the H1 cell line21

790

(to facilitate uniform processing and comparisons between LCLs and H1-derived datasets).

791

After alignment of the alternative reads, alignment of the original reads and alternative reads

792

were compared by WASP, and only the original reads for which all alternative reads aligned at

793

the same location with same CIGAR string were kept. Reads overlapping indels were removed.

794

Reads were then re-paired, and only pairs in which both reads survived this filtering were kept.

795

PCR duplicates were removed using Picard tool (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) with

796

default parameters. To ensure that our adapted WASP pipeline removed allelic mapping biases

797

effectively, we simulated all possible 100bp single end reads spanning SNPs in our LCLs and

798

aligned them back to the genome using our adapted WASP pipeline. We found no SNPs which

799

depart from 50/50 mapping ration between reference and alternative allele in these simulations.

800

We also took steps to remove any potential artifacts due to HindIII polymorphisms. Hi-C

801

data was obtained by cutting the genome with HindIII, so we reasoned that SNPs or indels that

802

disrupt existing HindIII sites or create novel HindIII sites could lead to differential cutting of two

803

alleles and thus the appearance of differential contact frequency. To mitigate these potential

804

artifacts, we identified all HindIII sites that would be disrupted or created by genetic variants

805

present in our samples, and removed all reads within 1Kb of these polymorphisms in all

806

individuals.

807

2.b. Contact Matrix Calculations. Matrices were generated and normalized as previously

808

described21,64. Briefly, intra-chromosomal read pairs were divided into 40Kb bin pairs based on

809

five prime positions. The number of read pairs connecting each pair of 40Kb bins were tallied to

810

produce contact matrices for each chromosome. Raw counts in the contact matrices were then

811

normalized using HiCNorm64 to correct for known sources of bias in Hi-C contact matrices (GC

812

content, mappability, fragment length). Bins that are unmappable (effective fragment length, GC

814

quantile normalized across samples to account for differing read depths and mitigate potential

815

batch effects. One such quantile normalized matrix was generated for each chromosome in

816

each replicate, as well as in each sample (replicates pooled together). We eliminated

817

chromosomes X and Y from all downstream analyses due to the gender differences between

818

our samples.

819

2.c. PC1 Score. PC1 scores were computed using methods defined previously13. Briefly,

820

quantile normalized matrices for each chromosome were transformed to Observed/Expected

821

(O/E) matrices by dividing each entry in the matrix by the expected contact frequency between

822

regions in that matrix at a given genomic distance. For a given matrix, the expected contact

823

frequencies were computed by averaging contact frequencies at the same distance in that each

824

matrix. The O/E matrices were further transformed to Pearson correlation matrices by the “cor”

825

function in R and eigen vectors (principal components) were computed using the “cov” function

826

in R. Generally, the first eigenvector (“PC1”) reflects A/B compartmentalization. However, for

827

some chromosomes we have seen that the second eigenvector sometimes reflects

828

compartmentalization, while the first eigenvector reflects other features like the two

829

chromosome arms. To systematically account for this effect, we examined the first three

830

eigenvectors for each chromosome in each replicate by correlating them with the gene density

831

(compartmentalization is correlated with gene density, while other properties like chromosome

832

arms generally are not). We required that PC1 show the highest correlation with gene density

833

among the first three eigenvectors in every replicate. If this was not the case for a given

834

chromosome, we eliminated that chromosome from all downstream analyses in all individuals to

835

be conservative. Six chromosomes were eliminated in this way: chr1, chr9, chr14, chr19, chr21

836

and chr22. For the chromosomes that passed this filter, the sign of the first eigenvector (which is

837

arbitrary) was adjusted such that the correlation between PC1 and gene density is positive, and

838

this positive PC1 values correspond to compartment A. Finally, PC1 tracks were manually

839

inspected to ensure that they are consistent with expected checkerboard patterns of

840

compartmentalization.

841

2.d. Directionality Index. Directionality Index was computed as previously described16. Briefly,

842

upstream and downstream contacts within 2Mb window for each 40Kb bin were counted, and

843

chi-square statistics were calculated under equal assumption. The sign of the chi-square

844

statistics was adjusted such that positive values represent upstream biases. For some bins,

845

there are more than five NA bins within 2Mb window and DI for those bins are not calculated. As

846

noted in the main text, we made a slight variation of these DI scores for the QTL searches in

847

which DI was recalculated using a window size of 200Kb to capture more local features.

848

2.e. Insulation Score. Insulation scores were computed as previously described16with some

849

adjustments. Briefly, contacts linking upstream and downstream 400Kb windows for each 40Kb

850

bin were calculated in the O/E matrices instead of raw matrices. We further divided the contact

851

frequency by the average of upstream and downstream 400Kb windows, to account for

852

differences in contact density across the chromosome. The Insulation Scores were then ranged

853

from 0 to 1, representing absolute insulation and no insulation respectively. Insulation scores for

854

bins, for which more than 50% cells in the 400Kb window as NA values, were not computed. For

855

the QTL search, we also calculated insulation scores using 200Kb window.

856

2.f. TADs Calling. TADs were called using the same approach as described previously16. DI

857

values for each 40Kb bins were used to build a Hidden Markov Model and predict the probability

858

being upstream bias, no bias, and downstream bias. Regions switching from upstream bias to

859

downstream bias were called as boundaries.

860

2.g. FIRE. We first calculated FIRE score for each of 20 individuals, as described in our

861

previous study19. Specifically, we mapped the raw reads to the reference genome hg19 as

862

described above. Next, we removed all intra-chromosomal reads within 15Kb, and created 40Kb

863

raw Hi-C contact matrix for each individual for each autosome. For each 40Kb bin, we

864

calculated the total number of intra-chromosomal reads in the distance range of 15-200Kb. We

865

then filtered bins as follows, starting from 72,036 autosomal 40Kb bins: First, we removed 40Kb

866

bins with zero effective fragment size, zero GC content, or zero mappability score64. Next, we

867

filtered out 40Kb bins within 200Kb of the bins removed in the previous step. We further filtered

868

out 40Kb bins overlapping with the chr6 MHC region (chr6:28,477,797-33,448,354; hg19), which

869

has extremely high SNP density that can make it difficult to correct for allelic mapping artifacts.

870

This left 64,222 40Kb bins for downstream analysis. Next, we applied HiCNormCis19 to remove

871

systematic biases from local genomic features, including effective fragment size, GC content

872

and mappability. The normalized total number of cis intra-chromosomal reads is defined as

873

FIRE score. We further performed quantile normalization across multiple individuals using R

874

package “preprocessCore”. The final FIRE score is log transformation log2(FIRE score + 1) and

875

converted into a Z-score to create a mean of 0 and standard deviation of one. To identify

876

significant FIRE bins in each individual, we used one-sided P-value < 0.05. Ultimately, merging

877

across all individuals, we identified 6,980 40Kb bins which are FIRE bin in at least one of 12 YRI

878

individuals. Consistent with our previous findings19, we observed significant enrichment of

879

GM12878 typical enhancers and super enhancers among these 6,980 40Kb FIRE bins

880

(Supplemental Figure 1d). GREAT analysis60 further showed immune-related biological

881

pathways and disease ontologies are enriched in these 6,980 40Kb FIRE bins (Supplemental

882

Figure 1e).

883
884

3. Comparison of intra-individual vs inter-individual variation. To estimate variability

885

between replicates, we computed Pearson correlation coefficient for all pairs of biological

886

replicates for each score (DI, INS, FIRE and PC1). The pairs then can be divided into two

887

groups based on whether they are from the same individuals as illustrated in Supplemental

888

Figure 4c. We then tested if the distribution of Pearson correlation coefficients were different

889

comparing two groups. Similar analysis was performed for contact matrices. For contact

890

matrices, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficient for each distance and each chromosome

891

separately as shown in Figure 1c.

892
893

4. Variable regions.

894

4.a. limma test for variable bins. To test regions that are variable across genomes, we applied

895

limma47 with default parameters. First, values for each 40Kb bin in hg19 reference genome were

896

calculated for each metrics tested (DI, FIRE, INS, PC1) as described above. DI, PC1, and INS

897

scores were calculated based on contact matrices quantile normalized across 40 replicates.

898

FIRE scores were calculated based on raw counts using HiCNormCis19 and then quantile

899

normalized across 40 replicates. Second, we filtered out bins that are not testable. Specifically,

900

FIRE scores were only tested for bins that are FIRE regions (p-value < 0.05) in any of 40

901

replicates. DI scores were only tested for bins where strong biases are observed (abs(DI) >

902

10.82757, which correspond to Chi-squared test p-value 0.001) in any of 40 replicates. INS

903

scores were only tested for bins where strong insulation is observed (z-score transformed INS

904

score < -1) in any of 40 replicates. No filterers were performed for PC1 scores. Third, we filtered

905

out any bins that overlapping large SVs (> 10,000 bp) to avoid effect caused by SVs.

906

Specifically, for FIRE, INS, and DI scores, bins that are within 200Kb, 400Kb, and 2Mb

907

respectively upstream or downstream of large SVs were removed. For PC1 scores, bins

908

overlapping large SVs were removed. Lastly, we applied limma standard model with individual

909

as a fixed factor and eBayes correction. To estimate empirical false positive rate (FDR), we

910

bootstrapped replicates to calculate the number of false positives in random background.

911

Briefly, we random selected 40 or 22 replicates with replacement for LCL20 and YRI11

912

respectively, and identified variable regions as mentioned above. We performed 1,000

913

permutations and calculated empirical FDR as the average positive hits in 1,000 permutations

914

divided by number of hits in real data.

915

4.b. Normalizing Hi-C contact matrices using BNBC normalization. To directly compare

916

individual Hi-C contact matrix cells across samples, we sought to remove unwanted per-cell

917

variation owing to date of processing or other unknown ‘batch’ effects. To this end we

918

developed Bandwise Normalization and Batch effect Correction (BNBC), described and

919

evaluated

920

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/214361v1). A brief description follows. For each

921

chromosome and for each strata of distance between loci (a matrix “band”, hence the term

922

“bandwise”), we correct for unwanted variation by taking the log counts-per-million-transformed

923

values of all samples and generating a matrix whose entries are the observations for that

924

chromosome’s matrix band across all samples (columns indexes samples and rows indexes

925

contact matrix cells with anchor bins separated by a fixed distance). We then quantile normalize

926

this matrix and regress out the impact of known batches (here, date of processing) using

927

ComBat65 (specifically we correct both mean and variance). This procedure essentially

928

conditions on genomic distance. We correct the majority of each contact matrix for each

929

chromosome for each sample: we correct all but the 8 most distal matrix bands, for which we

930

set all values to 0. The choice of the last 8 bands is empirical and reflects the small number of

931

observations in each band matrix. The procedure is implemented in the bnbc package available

932

through Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/bnbc). Correction of contact

933

matrices was performed on replicate-level data using the following LCLs: GM18486 (YRI-1),

934

GM18505 (YRI-2), GM18507 (YRI-3), GM18508 (YRI-4), GM18516 (YRI-5), GM18522 (YRI-6),

935

GM19099 (YRI-7), GM19141 (YRI-8), GM19204 (YRI-10), GM19238 (YRI-11), GM19239 (YRI-

936

12), GM19240 (YRI-13), HG00731 (PUR-1), HG00732 (PUR-2), HG00512 (CHS-1), HG00513

937

(CHS-2). We note that NA19239 (YRI-12) replicate 1 and NA19240 (YRI-13) replicate 2 were

938

excluded because the BNBC algorithm requires multiple samples from a given experimental

939

batch to estimate batch effect parameters.

940

4.c. Identifying biological variability in Hi-C contact matrices. To identify contacts with

941

significant levels of between-individual variability we employed the following procedure, which

942

mimics the analysis for INS, DI, FIRE and PC1, on contact matrices normalized by BNBC (see

943

section 4b). For each contact matrix cell (representing loci separated by less than 28 Mb, this is

944

a subset of the matrix cells normalized by BNBC) we used a linear model with individual

945

modeled as a fixed factor, note we have 2 growth replicates for almost every individual. We

946

used a parametric likelihood ratio test (equivalent to an F-test) to test whether there was

947

significant between-individual variation. We used the IHW framework49 with the distance

948

between anchor bins as informative covariate, to increase power and estimate false discovery

949

rate. We used a FDR of 10% as significance threshold, resulting in 115,817 contact matrix cells

950

with significant biological variability across the autosomes. To estimate effect size (depicted in

951

Figures 2a, 3a and Supplementary Figure S5) we used a linear mixed effect model with

952

individual as random effect, to decompose the variance into between-individual variability

953

(biological) and within-individual variability (technical). As the measure of biological variability in

954

these figures, we used the estimated biological variance. For this analysis, all 16 samples we

955

normalized using BNBC were used.

956

4.d. Correlation with other datasets. To examine correlation between 3D genome

957

organization and other genome features, we reidentified variable regions with the same pipeline

958

mentioned above using only individuals of which data is available for other gnome features, and

959

then computed Spearman correlation coefficient between 3D genome metrics (DI, INS, PC1,

960

and FIRE) and other genome features (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and DNase-seq) for each 40Kb bin

961

that is variable. Signals for each 40Kb bins were calculated by averaging signals for the bin.

962

Specifically, signals for ChIP-seq were the average signal of all peaks with in the bin, signals for

963

RNA-seq were the average FPKM of all genes in the bin, and DNase signals were simply

964

average signal for each base pair in the bin. In some cases, serval consecutive bins were

965

identified as variable. We only kept the bin with strongest signal for other genome features

966

among consecutive bins. To generate random backgrounds, we permutated individual labels for

967

the same set of bins and recomputed Spearman correlation coefficient. 10,000 such

968

permutations were used to calculate the statistical significance of departure from the null

969

hypothesis in which the median value of true correlation values and permutated correlation

970

values are equal. Similar analysis was performed for variable matrix cells with the following

971

modifications. First, we used the variable matrix cells in the preceding section 4c. Second, to

972

correlate matrix-cell-level contacts with bin-level DNase and ChIP-seq signals, anchor bins of

973

variable matrix cells were used. Since each anchor bin may belong to more than one matrix

974

cells, we only used each bin once and selected the one with the highest Spearman correlation

975

coefficient. Exactly same approach was performed during permutation to ensure a fair

976

comparison.

5. Phasing variants. Phasing of variants was performed based on HaploSeq pipeline43. Briefly,

979

1) Variants were filtered to keep only bi-allelic SNPs heterozygous in a given individual; 2)

980

Aligned Hi-C bam files were realigned and recalibrated using GATK 3.4.066 based on SNPs in

981

the individual; 3) Filtered SNPs and realigned bam files were then used as input to run

982

HAPCUT67; 4) Results from HAPCUT were further filtered to keep only the largest haplotype

983

block and combined with homozygous alt SNPs as input for imputation using Beagle 4.068 using

984

1000 Genome Phase 3 data excluding individual to phase as reference panel; 5) Results from

985

Beagle were then combined with results of HAPCUT by removing conflicting phased SNPs. For

986

all auto chromosomes except 1 and 9 in 18 out 20 individuals, we were able to obtain a single

987

haplotype block. For chromosome 1 and 9, two arms were phased separately because of large

988

heterochromatin region surrounding centromere. X chromosome was only phased for female

989

individuals. We excluded NA19193 and HG00514 from phasing because of the lack of available

990

high quality of genotypes. We evaluated accuracy of phasing in three probands in trios

991

(NA19240, NA12878, HG00733) and found phasing results are of very high accuracy

992

(~97.71%). Specifically, we calculated accuracy as percentage of correctly phased variants

993

among total phased variants. Only variants whose transmission from parents can be

994

ambiguously identified were used in calculation of accuracy where at least on parent is

995

homozygous. Detailed statistics for phasing are listed in Supplemental Table 6.

996

6. CTCF motif variation and looping strength. GM12878 loops and motif positions were

997

obtained

998

(GSE63525_GM12878_primary+replicate_HiCCUPS_looplist_with_motifs.txt.gz;

999

HiCCUPS loops). We limited our analysis to autosomal cis loops in which a CTCF motif in one

1000

of the anchor regions overlaps a SNP (N=572). To evaluate the impact of motif disruption, we

1001

first identified eight “key” positions in the CTCF PWM (Jaspar MA0139.1)69 in which a single

1002

base has higher than 0.75 probability. We refer to SNPs at these positions in motif occurrences

1003

with one allele matching the high-probability base as “motif disrupting SNPs”. We refer to alleles

1004

matching the consensus base in the motif as strong motif alleles (S), and alleles matching any

1005

other base as weak motif alleles (W). There are N=142 loops with a motif disrupting SNP in a

1006

convergently-oriented CTCF motif, which refer to below as testable loops. For each testable

1007

loop, we extracted the Hi-C interaction frequency in the loop bin from each LCL, and classified

1008

as either “WW”, “SW”, or “SS” depending on the individual’s genotype at the corresponding

1009

motif disrupting SNP. To enable aggregation of data across different SNPs, we set the mean

1010

“SW” interaction frequency for each SNP to 1 and normalized all values for that SNP

1011

accordingly. These values are plotted in Figure 4b. In addition, for each testable loop we

1012

extracted a submatrix including the loop bin as well as 15 bins upstream and 15 bins

1013

downstream. Submatrices with missing values were discarded. For each SNP, we calculated

1014

the mean submatrix for each genotype, and then subtracted submatrices to calculate the

1015

difference in each matrix cell per “W” allele (i.e. SS-SW and SW-WW). These differences were

1016

then averaged across all SNPs and plotted in Figure 4c. Submatrices with missing values were

1017

discarded. For the allelic analysis in S/W heterozygous individuals, we used chromosome-span

1018

phasing results (see methods section 4) to split the Hi-C reads from each chromosome in each

1019

LCL into two separate haplotypes. Specifically, we required at least one base pair overlap with

1020

phased heterozygous SNPs with high base calling score (>13) and high mapping quality (>20).

1021

Reads overlapping indels or containing SNPs from both haplotypes were not used.

1022

Approximately 7.89% of Hi-C reads covered a heterozygous variant and could thus be assigned

1023

to one of the two haplotypes. The accuracy of haplotype assignment was evaluated by fraction

1024

of homologous-trans (h-trans) read, which contain SNPs from both haplotypes. On average

1025

~1% reads were h-trans, suggesting high quality of the assignment. For each testable loop, we

1026

defined 40Kb windows around the center of each loop anchor region and calculated the number

1027

of reads connecting these two anchor windows (“loop reads”) on each haplotype. For each

1028

heterozygous LCL, we then calculated the percentage of loop reads that occur on the haplotype

1029

containing the S allele at the motif disrupting SNPs anchor. We required that at least 10 total

1030

loop reads were present for a given loop in a given heterozygous LCL, leading to a total of 218

1031

data points from 105 different loops for inclusion in Figure 4d.

1033

7. Identification of QTLs.

1034

7.a. Testable bins. To identify testable bins for FIRE-QTL, DI-QTL, INS-QTL and C-QTL

1035

searches, we began with 72,036 autosomal 40Kb bins based on reference genome hg19. We

1036

eliminated “unreliable” bins with effective length, GC content, or mappability equal to zero70,

1037

resulting in 66,597 bins remaining. We further removed any 40Kb bins within 200Kb of an

1038

unreliable bin, resulting in 64,337 40Kb bins. We also removed bins covering the chr6 MHC

1039

locus (hg19: chr6:28,477,797-33,448,354, which is extremely polymorphic and may lead to

1040

complex mapping artifacts that are difficult to correct. To eliminate false signals in Hi-C data that

1041

could arise from large structural variations (SVs), we obtained SVs from the 1000 Genomes

1042

consortium35

1043

trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/phase3/integrated_sv_map/ALL.wgs.integrated_sv_map_v

1044

2.20130502.svs.genotypes.vcf.gz) and removed bins which overlap one or more structural

1045

variants previously annotated in these individuals (N=123,015 SVs), or within 200Kb of large

1046

structural variations (>10Kb, N=1,253 SVs). These filtering steps yielded a set of 51,511

1047

testable bins, which represent a common starting point for FIRE-QTL, DI-QTL, INS-QTL and C-

1048

QTL searches as described below.

1049

7.b. Testable SNPs. We began with a list of 15,765,667 variants among all 20 LCL individuals

1050

(Supplemental Table 3). We kept 14,177,284 variants among 11 unrelated YRI individuals,

1051

removed all indels, HindIII site polymorphisms, multi-allelic SNPs, and SNPs with minor allele

1052

frequency (MAF) < 5%. We also required that remaining SNPs were within the 51,511 testable

1053

bins described above, and that both alleles were present in at least 2 individuals in the

1054

discovery set individuals. (N=4,132,791 SNPs remaining). Finally, where multiple SNPs in the

1055

same bin were in perfect LD among 11 unrelated YRI individuals, we selected one with the

1056

smallest genomic position (to avoid the introduction of a random selection that would not be

1057

perfectly reproducible), ultimately yielding 1,304,404 potentially testable SNPs that served as a

1058

common input set to all QTL searches.

1059

7.c. Power Calculations. To explore the power of our approach and data, we performed a

1060

Monte Carlo-based power calculation. Specifically, we varied four variables: (1) the minor allele

1061

frequency of a variant; (2) the effect size of genotype (a fixed effect); (3) the variability between

1062

subjects (a random effect); (4) the variability of the residuals. For contact QTLs, we also varied

1063

the mean of the Hi-C contact frequency in question. For analyses reported, we fixed the number

1064

of replicates-per-subject to be 2 (consistent with our study design). We explored a variety of

1065

settings for these parameters to assess power as each variable changes (see Supplemental

1066

Table 7). Each setting tested was chosen to reflect the distribution of observed values in our

1067

real Hi-C data. For each configuration of parameters, we performed the following simulation: We

1068

simulated genotypes by randomly sampling a set of alleles (one allele per subject) from a

1069

binomial distribution parameterized by the number of subjects and the MAF; we repeated this

1070

process twice and create per-subject genotypes by adding the results of the sampling of alleles.

1071

We simulated per-subject random effects, and per-sample residuals. To obtain a given sample's

1072

simulated Hi-C contact matrix value, we added the mean Hi-C contact matrix value to that

1073

sample's simulated genotype (multiplied by the pre-specified effect size), the specific subject's

1074

random intercept and the sample's random residual. After performing this for all samples, we

1075

then fitted the same LMM model used in our QTL search. We repeated this simulation and

1076

model fitting process 1,000 times and computed power as the fraction of times the null

1077

hypothesis that the effect of genotype is equal to 0 is rejected at a nominal p-value of 0.05.

7.d. FIRE, DI, and INS QTL searches. 7.d.i. FIRE tested bins and SNPs. We limited our FIRE

1079

QTL search to the subset of testable bins that were called as FIRE in at least one YRI LCL

1080

(N=5,822 FIRE test bins), and the subset of testable SNPs therein (N=128,137 FIRE test

1081

SNPs). 7.d.ii. INS tested bins and SNPs. For the INS-QTL search, we examined 328,530 test

1082

SNPs with 12,976 variable INS bins (see methods section 4a). 7.d.iii. DI tested bins and

1083

SNPs. For the DI-QTL search, we examined 181,950 test SNPs with 7,590 variable DI bins

1084

((see methods section 4a). For the DI-QTL search, we further classified each DI bin based on

1085

which whether it showed stronger upstream or downstream bias, because we saw a Simpson’s

1086

paradox when we considered them together (see discussion above, Supplemental Figure 10b).

1087

This was done as follows: for each bin we evaluated the DI score in each of 11 unrelated YRIs

1088

and identified the DI score among these individuals with the largest absolute value. We defined

1089

a bin as “upstream DI bias” if the DI score with the highest absolute value was positive, or

1090

“downstream DI bias”, if the DI score with the highest absolute value was negative. Only

1091

37/7,590 bins (0.4%) had individuals with both positive and negative DI. 7.d.iv. LMM QTL

1092

searches. For each test SNP, we identified the 40Kb bin it belongs to, and fitted a linear mixed

1093

effect model, using FIRE, DI (200Kb window; see section 2d), or INS score (200Kb window; see

1094

section 2e) in each biological replicate as the response variable and genotype of that testable

1095

SNP as the explanatory variable. Since two biological replicates from the same individuals are

1096

correlated included an individual-specific random effect to account for within-individual

1097

correlation. We used the R package “nlme” and R function “gls” to fit the linear mixed effect

1098

model. The quantile-quantile plots (QQplot) showed only minor genomic inflation (median p-

1099

value = 0.4821, lambda = 1.0864 for FIRE-QTLs; median p-value = 0.4864, lambda = 1.0649 for

1100

upstream-biased DI-QTLs; median p-value = 0.4828, lambda = 1.0826 for downstream-biased

1101

DI-QTLs; median p-value = 0.4865, lambda = 1.0646 for INS-QTLs). The linear mixed effect

1102

model identified 476, 315, 315, and 1,092 SNPs with false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.20

1103

for FIRE, upstream-biased DI, downstream-biased DI and INS, respectively. When more than

1104

one SNP in the same bin was identified, we selected the SNP with lowest p-value among them

1105

to be included in the final QTL sets. After this filtering, we ended up with 387 candidate FIRE-

1106

QTLs, 268 candidate upstream-biased DI-QTLs, 277 downstream-biased DI-QTLs, and 911

1107

candidate INS-QTLs. As a control for each of these QTL searches, we randomly shuffled the

1108

score in question (i.e. FIRE, DI, or INS) among all 11 YRI individuals and performed QTL

1109

searches on this permuted data. In each of these tests, we found no SNPs associated with the

1110

permuted scores at FDR < 0.20.

1111

7.e. C-QTL search. To find QTLs affecting Hi-C contact strength we first identified 115,187 Hi-C

1112

contact matrix cells exhibiting substantial biological variability as described in section 4b, and

1113

constrained our QTL search to these cells. We then intersected these contact cells with

1114

1,304,404 testable SNPs by requiring a SNP to sit in one anchor bin of one of these variable

1115

matrix cells. We also filtered out matrix cells to ensure both anchor bins of the matric cell are

1116

among 51,511 testable bins. In total, we obtained 3,109,039 tests involving 687,655 SNPs and

1117

54,880 matrix cells on all 22 autosomes. For each test, we used the BNBC normalized data

1118

described in section 4, but used only the 11 unrelated YRI individuals with genotypes available

1119

and fit a linear mixed effect model in which genotype is a fixed effect and subject is a random

1120

intercept. We then used “lmerTest” package in R to estimate p-values for the fixed effect of

1121

genotype71. We used the IHW framework49 to estimate FDR, with the distance between anchor

1122

bins as an informative covariate, and call any matrix cell with FDR < 0.2 as significant. We

1123

further filtered significant tests by selecting the most significant SNPs per matrix cell and kept

1124

the leftmost SNPs among SNPs in perfect LD in two anchor bins of the matrix cell. After filtering,

1125

we ended up with 463 tests involving 345 SNPs and 463 matrix cells. To make the aggregate

1126

contact plots in Figure 4g, we recoded the genotypes based on the direction of effect such that

1127

0, 1, 2 refer to the genotypes containing 0, 1 or 2 alleles associated with the increased

1128

phenotype, respectively. Next, to avoid aggregating the same submatrix multiple times, we

1129

filtered by 1) selecting only the most significant matrix cell associated with each QTL, 2)

1130

selecting only the most significant QTL associated with each anchor bin (in some cases the

1131

same bin anchors multiple matrix cells associated with different QTL SNPs). This filtering left

1132

165 unique matrix cell QTL interactions for plotting. For each matrix cell, we then extracted a

1133

submatrix including 25 bins upstream and 25 bins downstream. Submatrices with missing

1134

values were discarded. For each QTL, we then calculated the mean submatrix values for each

1135

genotype, and then subtracted submatrices to calculate the difference in interaction frequency

1136

between the 1 and 0 genotypes, and between the 1 and 2 genotypes. These differences were

1137

then averaged across QTLs and plotted in Figure 4g

1138

7.f. Validation of QTLs in additional individuals. Our validation set included six unrelated

1139

individuals not included in the discovery set: NA12878, NA19240, HG00512, HG00513,

1140

HG00731 and HG00732. For each QTL, we collected the genotype among six additional

1141

individuals, and the corresponding FIRE, DI, or INS scores. Note that a small fraction of QTLs

1142

have missing genotypes in these six individuals (coded as “-1”), and these missing data points

1143

were eliminated from validation analysis. We examined the distributions of scores for each

1144

genotype. For each QTL type (i.e. FIRE, DI, or INS), we found that the same direction of effect

1145

observed in the discovery set is observed on average in the validation set. To assess the

1146

significance of this observation, we approximated the null expectation as follows. For FIRE-

1147

QTLs, for example, we started from all 128,137 FIRE test SNPs and 5,822 FIRE test bins. Note

1148

that in our discovery set, we identified 387 FIRE-QTLs, each in a different 40Kb bin. To create a

1149

random control SNP group, we first randomly selected 387 40Kb bins from all 5,822 FIRE test

1150

bins. Next, within each select bin, we randomly selected one SNP, and combined all these 387

1151

selected SNPs into a control SNP group. We then tested their SNP effect on the six additional

1152

individuals. We repeated such sampling with replacement 1,000 times, to create a null

1153

distribution of positive and negative SNP effect, respectively. We performed the same type of

1154

permutations for DI, INS. Similar analysis was performed for C-QTLs with a few modifications.

1155

First, we only used replicates from NA19420, HG00512, HG00513, HG00731 and HG00732 as

1156

explained in methods section 4. Second, 1,000 random permutations were performed by

1157

sampling matrix cells instead of bins. Third, we used values of biological replicates separately

1158

instead of as merged data because the BNBC normalization is performed at the level of

1159

replicates.

1160

7.g. Examining epigenetic variation at FIRE, DI, INS, and C-QTLs. To examine epigenetic

1161

variation at 3D genome QTLs, we re-analyzed DNase-seq data from 59 LCLs38, histone

1162

modification ChIP-Seq data (H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3) for 65 LCLs39, and CTCF

1163

ChIP-seq data from 11 LCLs54. These data were re-mapped using the WASP pipeline to control

1164

for allelic mapping artifacts and calculating the signal in 40kb bins as described above in section

1165

3.b. We examined the effect of genotype at FIRE, DI, INS or C-QTLs on DNase-seq and ChIP-

1166

seq signal by linear regression. As a control, we randomly selected the matched number of

1167

SNPs with the same approach described in section 7.f and re-did such validation analysis. We

1168

repeated such random sample 1,000 times to create the empirical null distribution of no genetic

1169

effect. For C-QTLs, we used the sum of epigenetic features in two anchor bins to calculate

1170

correlation with contact frequency.

1171
1172

8. Nominal fraction analyses.

1173

8.a. Comparing between 3D chromatin QTL types. To compare between different 3D

1174

chromatin QTLs, we took the raw test results for each QTL set and projected other 3D QTLs

1175

into the test results. For example, in Figure 4j we selected subset of SNPs that are DI-QTLs and

1176

plotted them (dark green dots) using p-values from FIRE-QTLs along with all tested in the FIRE-

1177

QTL search (black dots). We also used all tested SNPs in the DI-QTL search (light green dots)

1178

as a control set. To assign significance to the overlap, we compared the fraction of SNPs with

1179

nominal significance (p-value<0.05) in each set: 1) DI-QTL tested SNPs that were not significant

1180

QTLs, and 2) DI-QTLs. We calculated p-values for this comparison by Chi-square test. To rule

1181

out the effect of sampling bias when selecting a small number of SNPs, we also performed

1182

permutation. In each permutation, we randomly selected the same number of SNPs as the real

1183

QTL set (from the full set of tested SNPs) and calculated the fraction with nominal significance.

1184

We then computed bootstrap p-values using 10,000 such permutations under the null

1185

hypothesis that the fraction of nominal significance is the same between QTLs and random

1186

selected SNPs. For C-QTLs, one SNP may be tested against multiple matrix cells, so we only

1187

keep the most significant p-value for each SNP to avoid biases towards SNPs with multiple

1188

tests.

1189

8.b. Comparing 3D chromatin QTLs to other molQTLs. Similar approaches were used to

1190

assess overlap between 3D chromatin QTLs and other molQTLs. We obtained full test results

1191

(all tested SNPs with the p-values) from previous molQTL studies and projected 3D chromatin

1192

QTLs into those test results. We the calculated fraction of nominal significance and used chi-

1193

square test to evaluate significance between 3D-QTLs and non-3D-QTLs. Similarly, we

1194

performed bootstrap to estimate significance empirically. One modification is that we extended

1195

our QTL sets by incorporating all SNPs in perfect LD with the same 40Kb bin because we may

1196

not use the same tagging SNP in our study as used in other studies. To ensure a fair

1197

comparison, we performed the same extension for the control sets of all tested SNPs.

1198

8.c. Comparing 3D chromatin QTLs to GWAS. Comparison with the GWAS results was

1199

performed in the same manner as described above in 8.b. for other molQTLs. Instead of test

1200

results for other molQTLs, we used summary statistics from previous GWAS.

1202

9. FISH.

1203

9.a. Cell preparation for FISH. Approximately 100,000 cells were adhered to center of PDL-

1204

coated coverslips (Neuvitro, GG-22-15-PDL) by placing 100 uL of cells at 1 x 106 cells/mL. Cells

1205

on coverslips were incubated for an hour at 37°C, carefully washed with PBS, and fixed with 4%

1206

paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS for 10 mins. PFA was quenched with 0.1 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 for 10

1207

mins, washed with PBS, and stored in 1X PBS at 4°C for up to 1 month.

1208

9.b. BAC probe labeling and preparation. All BAC clones were ordered from the BACPAC

1209

Resource Center at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute: “U” probe is RP11-

1210

74P5, “C” probe is RP11-337N12, and “D” probe is RP11-248M23. BAC DNAs were labeled

1211

with either Chromatide Alexa Fluor 488-5 dUTP (Invitrogen, C-11397) or Alexa Fluor 647-aha-

1212

dUTP (Invitrogen, A32764) using nick-translation kit (Roche, 10976776001), and incubated in

1213

15°C for 4 hours. The nick-translation reaction was deactivated using 1 uL of 0.5 M EDTA, pH

1214

8.0 and heated for 10 mins at 65°C. The probes were then purified using illustra ProbeQuant G-

1215

50 Micro Columns (GE Healthcare, 28903408) and eluted to a concentration of 20 ng/uL.

1216

Probes were mixed with Human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, 15279011) and salmon sperm

1217

(Invitrogen, 15632011), and precipitated with 1/10th volume of 3M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 and

1218

2.5 volume of absolute ethanol for at least 2 hours at -20°C. Probes were then spun down,

washed with cold 70% ethanol, resuspended in formamide and 40% dextran sulfate in 8X SSC,

1220

and incubated at 55°C.

1221

9.c. Hybridization. Cells on coverslips were blocked with 5% BSA and 0.1% triton-X 100 in

1222

PBS for 30 mins at 37°C, and washed twice with 0.1% triton-X 100 in PBS for 10 mins each with

1223

gentle agitation at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin and 0.1%

1224

triton-X 100 in PBS for 10 mins at room temperature. Next, they were incubated in 20% glycerol

1225

in PBS for 20 mins, freeze-thawed three times with liquid nitrogen, and incubated in 0.1M

1226

hydrogen chloride at room temperature for 30 mins. Cells were further blocked for 1 hour at

1227

37°C in 3% BSA and 100 ug/mL RNase A in PBS. Cells were permeabilized again with 0.5%

1228

saponin and 0.5% triton-X 100 in PBS for 30 mins at room temperature. Lastly, they were rinsed

1229

with 1X PBS and washed with 2X SSC for 5 mins. For hybridization of probes, the prepared

1230

probes were denatured at 73°C for 5 mins in water bath. Cells were denatured in a two-step

1231

process in a 73°C water bath: 2.5 mins in 70% formamide in 2X SSC and 1 min in 50%

1232

formamide in 2X SSC. Denatured probes were transferred onto microscope slides, and

1233

coverslips were placed on top with cell-side facing down. The coverslips were sealed with

1234

rubber cement and incubated overnight at 37°C in a dark, humid chamber. Next day, coverslips

1235

were carefully removed and transferred onto a 6-well plate. Cells were washed at 37°C with

1236

gentle agitation, twice with 50% formamide in 2X SSC for 15 mins and three times with 2X SSC

1237

for 5 mins. The cells were then stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306), mounted on microscope

1238

slides with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, P36930), sealed with nail polish, and

1239

imaged.

1240

9.d. Microscope and analysis. Images were acquired with DeltaVision RT Deconvolution

1241

Microscope at UC San Diego’s department of neuroscience (acquired with award NS047101).

1242

Captured images were processed using the TANGO72 plugin in ImageJ for quantitative analysis.

1243

Each FISH experiment contained two probes labeled with different color dyes (either U-C or C-

1244

D). We limited our analysis to nuclei containing 2 labeled foci for each color (4 total foci),

1245

allowing us to more confidently distinguish foci in cis from those in trans. Distances were

1246

measured from the center of one color focus to the center of the closest focus of the other color.

10. Re-analysis of public datasets

1249

10.a. Analysis of ChIP-seq data from Kasowski et al and McVicker et al. Raw fastq files

1250

were downloaded from SRA database for each experiment (SRP030041 and SRP026077,

1251

respectively). Reads were aligned to hg19 reference genome using BWA MEM (Kasowski) or

1252

BWA ALN63 v0.7.8 (McVicker) with WASP pipeline45 to eliminate allelic mapping bias. Only

1253

reads with high mapping quality (>10) were kept. PCR duplicates were removed using Picard

1254

tools v1.131 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). MACS273 v2.2.1 was then used to call peaks

1255

using corresponding input files. For CTCF and SA1, default parameters were used for MACS2.

1256

For H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3, peak calling was done using “--nomodel” parameter

1257

because we do not expect sharp peaks for histone modifications. For H3K27me3 and

1258

H3K36me3, peak calling was done using “--nomodel --broad” parameter. Bigwig files were

1259

generated by MACS2 using fold enrichment for viewing in genome browser. All Kasowski data

1260

were processed in pair-end mode and both replicates were merged for analysis. All McVicker

1261

data were processed in single-end mode, and the pooled input data were used for all samples

1262

because there are no individual input files. To compute signals in peaks, we used a set of

1263

merged peaks across all individuals for each mark.

1264

10.b. Analysis of RNA-seq data from Kasowski et al. Raw fastq files were downloaded from

1265

SRA database (SRP030041). Reads were aligned to hg19 reference genome using STAR74

1266

v2.4.2a with the WASP pipeline in pair-end mode to eliminate allelic mapping bias. Gencode75

1267

v24 annotation was used to construct STAR index and computing FPKM. Only uniquely mapped

1268

reads were kept. Cufflinks76 v2.2.1 was applied to compute FPKM values. Both replicates were

1269

merged for analysis.

1270

10.c. Analysis of DNase-seq data from Degner et al. Raw fastq files were downloaded from

1271

SRA database for each experiment (SRP007821). Reads were aligned to hg19 reference

1272

genome using BWA ALN with the WASP pipeline in single-end mode to eliminate allelic

1273

mapping bias. Only reads with high mapping quality (>10) were kept. PCR duplicates were

1274

removed using Picard tools. Bigwig files were generated using makeUCSCfile commands in

1275

homer tools77 v4.9.1.

1276

10.d. Analysis of ChIP-seq data from Ding et al. Raw fastq files were downloaded from SRA

1277

database for each experiment (SRP004714). Reads were aligned to hg19 reference genome

1278

using BWA MEM v0.7.8 with the WASP pipeline to eliminate allelic mapping bias. Only reads

1279

with high mapping quality (>10) were kept. PCR duplicates were removed using Picard tools.

1280

We performed quality control for CTCF ChIP-seq data by FRIP (Fraction of Reads In Peaks)

1281

and used datasets with FRIP > 10. Bigwig files were generated using bamCoverage commands

1282

in deepTools78 v2.3.3. To compute signals in peaks, we used the merged CTCF peaks from

1283

Kasowski data.

1284

10.e. Analysis of ChIP-seq data from Grubert et al. Bigwig files and peaks for H3K27ac,

1285

H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 were downloaded from GEO database (GSE62742). Peaks for each

1286

mark were merged and then used to compute the averaged signal.
