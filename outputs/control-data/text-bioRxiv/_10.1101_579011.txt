Abstract
A growing body of evidence indicates that miRNAs may either drive or suppress oncogenesis.
However, little is known about somatic mutations in miRNA genes. To determine the
frequency and potential consequences of miRNA gene mutations, we analyzed whole exome
sequencing datasets of ~500 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and ~500 lung squamous cell
carcinoma (LUSC) samples generated in the TCGA. Altogether, we identified >1000 mutations
affecting ~500 different miRNA genes and showed that half of all cancers had at least one such
mutation. Mutations occurred in most crucial parts of miRNA precursors, including mature
miRNA and seed sequences. We showed that seed mutations strongly affected miRNA:target
interactions, drastically changing the pool of predicted targets. Mutations may also affect
miRNA biogenesis by changing the structure of miRNA precursors, DROSHA and DICER
cleavage sites, and regulatory sequence/structure motifs. We identified 10 significantly
overmutated hotspot miRNA genes, including the miR-379 gene in LUAD enriched in
mutations in the mature miRNA and regulatory sequences. The occurrence of mutations in
the hotspot miRNA genes was also shown experimentally. We present a comprehensive
analysis of somatic mutations in miRNA genes and show that some of these genes are
mutational hotspots, suggesting their potential role in cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide
(1) and is defined as a group of distinct diseases with high genetic and cellular heterogeneity
(2). Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer subtype and can
be further divided into lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC),
and large cell carcinoma (LCC). Genetic profiles of these cancers have been revealed by several
whole genome and whole exome next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects that led to the
identification of thousands of somatic mutations within individual cancer genomes (3-6).
Analysis of these mutations allowed the elucidation of several important protein-coding driver
genes, including KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, MET, RIT1, ALK, and NF1 in LUAD and PIK3CA, FGFR1, and
PTEN in LUSC (7-9). Therapeutic strategies specifically targeting some of these drivers have
been developed and successfully trialed, and they are now the most prominent examples of
successful personalized/targeted therapies (10). However, key drivers are not yet recognized
for substantial fractions of LUAD and LUSC cases (7-11).
Other functional genetic elements coded by non-protein-coding sections of the
genome include short non-coding single-stranded RNA particles called microRNAs (miRNAs).
It is estimated that miRNAs regulate the expression of most protein-coding genes (12,13). At
present, nearly 2000 human miRNAs have been described, but the biological functions of most
miRNAs remain unknown (14). miRNA-coding sequences are not randomly distributed over
the genome and are overrepresented in certain positions associated with fragile sites involved
in cancer (15). miRNAs may be encoded in independent transcriptional units or protein-coding
genes in either the sense or antisense orientation and are mostly expressed as long 5’-capped
and 3’-polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Mature miRNAs are generated in cells
in a multistage process of miRNA biogenesis (16-18). In the nucleus, pri-miRNAs are processed
by the RNase DROSHA and DGCR8 within the Microprocessor complex to release hairpin
miRNA precursors (~80 nt, pre-miRNAs). After pre-miRNA export to the cytoplasm, the RNase
DICER removes the apical loop to release a 19-25-bp miRNA duplex containing 2-nt 3’
overhangs on both ends. The miRNA duplex is then incorporated into the miRNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC), where it is unwound; one strand (passenger strand) is released, and
the other strand (guide strand or mature miRNA) is selected to target complementary
transcripts. Generally, miRNAs function as cytoplasmic regulators via base-pairing with
complementary (or nearly complementary) sequences within mRNA (mostly in the 3’UTR).

This posttranscriptional silencing of gene expression occurs through transcript deadenylation
and/or degradation or translation inhibition. Canonical miRNA:target interactions occur via
complementarity of the 7-nt seed region defined by nucleotides 2-8 of mature miRNA.
Additional mechanisms that regulate the level and fidelity of miRNA maturation and function
exist at each step of miRNA biogenesis (16,19). For example, specific structural features and
primary sequence motifs (basal UG, CNNC, and loop UGUG motifs) present in miRNA
precursors were shown to facilitate miRNA processing (20,21).
The important role of miRNA in the regulation of physiological processes such as
growth, development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (22,23) prompted
extensive studies in cancer. For example, dozens of miRNA expression profiling studies in lung
cancer have been performed, and many consistently overexpressed (e.g., miR-21, miR-210,
miR-182, miR-31, miR-200b, and miR-205) and underexpressed miRNAs (e.g., miR-126, miR30a, miR-30d, miR-486, miR-451a, and miR-143) have been identified (for summary, see
previous meta-analyses (24,25)). It has been determined that the upregulation or
downregulation of certain miRNAs may contribute to carcinogenesis, and therefore, such
miRNAs may be classified as either oncogenes (oncomiRs) or tumor suppressors
(suppressormiRs) (26,27). Among the most intensively studied oncomiRs in lung cancer and
other types of cancer are miR-21, miR-155, the miR-17-92 cluster and miR-205. Similarly, a
group of suppressormiRs, such as those in the let-7 and miR-200 families and miR-143, has
been identified. miRNAs have been shown to play an important role in many oncogenic
processes, including proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), migration,
angiogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis, and response to cancer treatment. Thus, miRNAs have
been implicated as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and cancer therapeutic targets
(reviewed in (28-31)). Additionally, miRNA genes are often either amplified or deleted in
cancer in a similar fashion as protein coding oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and
somatic copy number variation may be an important mechanism underlying aberrant miRNA
expression in cancer (15,32,33)
In contrast to the excitement about the role of miRNA in cancer, very little is known
about somatic mutations in miRNA genes (defined here as sequences encoding pre-miRNAs
and their directly adjacent flanks; note that actual miRNA genes are much larger, encoding
entire transcription units) in cancer. Important exceptions are (i) a recently published study
reporting a tool (ADmiRE) for the annotation and prioritization of different genetic variants,

including somatic mutations in miRNAs (34), (ii) a database of somatic mutations affecting the
interactions of miRNAs with competing endogenous RNAs (SomamiR), including somatic
mutations in miRNAs (35), and (iii) recent reports of somatic mutations in pre-miR-142 (the
only example of recurrently mutated miRNA gene in cancer), shown to contribute to the
development of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and acute myeloid
leukemia (36-38).
The importance of miRNA gene sequences is reflected by their high conservation and
low genetic variability (39-41). Previous studies by our group and others have shown that the
density of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is significantly lower in miRNA genes than
in their flanking sequences or in the whole genome (42-45). We have also shown that miRNA
genes less frequently overlap with common copy number variations (CNVs) (43). On the other
hand, SNPs located in miRNA genes may affect miRNA biogenesis and the specificity of miRNA
target recognition. For example, the G>C substitution (SNP rs138166791) in the penultimate
position of pre-miR-890, significantly lowers the cleavage efficiency by DROSHA and,
consequently, decreases the levels of mature miR-890-5p and miR-890-3p (46). There is also
evidence that some SNPs within miRNA genes may correlate with different diseases, including
cancer (47-53). Finally, there are a few examples of Mendelian diseases caused by germline
mutations in miRNA genes (54-57).
To determine the frequency and potential consequences of mutations in miRNA genes,
as well as to identify potential overmutated hotspot miRNA genes, we searched for somatic
mutations in >1600 miRNA genes using whole exome sequencing (WES) datasets of >1000
samples of the two most common types of lung cancer, i.e., LUAD and LUSC. As a result, we
identified over 1000 mutations in more than 500 different miRNA genes and showed that a
substantial fraction of the mutated miRNA genes overlap in the two types of lung cancer. We
characterized all the mutations in terms of localization (in subregions of miRNA precursors),
type, and potential functional consequences. Among the identified mutations were mutations
in well-known oncomiRs and suppressormiRs, including let-7, miR-21, and miR-205. A
substantial fraction of the mutations were localized in sequences of mature miRNAs, including
in seed sequences and DROSHA and DICER cleavage sites. We performed an analysis with a
set of computational tools and showed that somatic mutations in miRNA genes may affect (i)
target recognition, (ii) the structure of miRNA precursors, and (iii) structural/sequence motifs
that play a role in RNA:protein interactions important for miRNA biogenesis. Finally, we

identified and characterized several significantly overmutated hotspot miRNA genes that may
be potential driver oncomiRs or suppressormiRs.

RESULTS
General characteristics of the identified somatic mutations
To identify somatic mutations in miRNA genes, we took advantage of WES datasets of 569
LUAD and 479 LUSC samples generated within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We
focused our analysis on miRNA genes encoding the most crucial and well-defined sequences
of primary miRNA precursors, i.e., pre-miRNA-coding sequences and flanking sequences
extending 25 nt upstream and downstream. The sequencing datasets covered 80% of known
human miRNA genes (1642 of nearly 2000) (Supplementary Table S1).
In the set of selected miRNA genes, we identified 545 and 546 somatic mutations in
350 and 353 miRNA genes in LUAD and LUSC, respectively (Figure 1A and Supplementary Table
S2). More than half of the mutated miRNA genes are annotated as high confidence in miRBase.
As shown in Figure 1B, the sets of mutated miRNA genes strongly overlapped between the
two types of cancer, and the number of miRNA genes mutated in these two cancers
significantly exceeded the number expected by chance (hypergeometric probability with
normal approximation test: fold enrichment=2.3; p<1 × 10-45 ). The distribution of mutation
types was similar between the two cancers, with substitutions, indels, and complex mutations
accounting for ~91%, 4%, and 5%, respectively. At least one mutation was found in ~50% and
~60% of LUAD and LUSC samples, respectively (Supplementary Figure S1). Over 75% of the
mutated samples had either one (~49%) or two (28%) mutations, and less than 3% had more
than 5 mutations. To verify the reliability of our data processing method (passing variant
thresholds), in the similar way, we performed a mutation analysis in the well-known LUAD
protein-coding cancer drivers. The mutation frequencies in the particular drivers were
consistent with that determined before (r2=0.92; p=0.0002) (9).
As shown in Figure 1C, the distribution of mutations across chromosomes only roughly
correlated with the number of miRNA genes located on a particular chromosome (LUAD:
r2=0.465, p=0.0003; LUSC: r2=0.443, p=0.0005). Exceptions were overmutation of
chromosomes 19 (in both cancer types) and 14 (in LUSC) and undermutation of chromosomes
1 and 2 (in LUSC and LUAD, respectively). Overall, the most abundantly mutated chromosomes

were 14, 19, and X, encompassing 20% of the analyzed miRNA genes, but cumulatively
accounting for 40% of the mutations (Figure 1D).
Somatic mutations are not equally distributed along miRNA precursors
To look closer at the localization of mutations in subregions of miRNA precursors, we
superimposed the identified mutations (substitutions only) on the consensus miRNA
precursor structure (Figure 2A) and categorized them according to localization in the miRNA
gene subregions (Table 1, Supplementary Table S2). As shown in Figure 2 in both LUAD and
LUSC samples, mutations were more or less evenly distributed along the miRNA precursor
sequence, with slight enrichment in miRNA duplex vs. non-miRNA duplex sequences (5.9 vs.
4.5 mutations/Mbp [mut/Mbp], p=0.0012, and 6.9 vs. 5.5 mut/Mbp, p=0.0078, in LUAD and
LUSC, respectively (binomial distribution)). A similar mutation distribution was observed when
precursors of predominantly 5’- and 3’-miRNAs were analyzed separately (Figure 2B and C,
lower panels) and when the analysis was narrowed to the precursors of high-confidence
miRNAs defined by either miRBase or MiRGeneDB (14,58) (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore,
the division of the mutations into the functional subregions of miRNA gene revealed the
further differences in mutation distribution, with the highest mutation density in the mature
miRNA sequence (including seed) and the lowest mutation density in the 5’flanking sequence,
consistently in LUAD and LUSC (Table 1).
Mutations in miRNA seed regions alter mRNA target recognition
It may be expected that the effect of an miRNA gene mutation will strongly depend on its
localization. The most unequivocal effect is caused by mutations in the miRNA seed region
responsible for miRNA:target interactions. Any change in this region may significantly alter the
spectrum of regulated transcripts. To obtain deeper insight into the scale of changes in target
recognition caused by seed mutations, we employed TargetScan to identify potential targets
of corresponding wild-type and mutated miRNAs (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S3). The
analysis was performed for 48 and 56 seed mutations in LUAD and LUSC, respectively. As
expected, the target overlap between wild-type and mutated miRNAs was generally low and
usually did not exceed a few percents. The highest overlap of targets was observed for
mutations in the last (7th) position of the seed sequence. Additionally, mutations may cause
either a decrease or an increase in a number of predicted targets. As shown for miR-518d-3p,
two mutations located in adjacent positions of the seed sequence have completely different

effects on the number of predicted targets (Figure 3). The extreme examples are the
mutations at the 2nd position of the miR-1306-3p seed (167x increase in the number of
predicted targets, 5 vs. 836) and at the 2nd position of the miR-922-3p seed (48x decrease, 387
vs. 8) (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S3).
Somatic mutations may alter interactions of miRNA precursors with regulatory proteins
An increasing number of proteins regulating miRNA biogenesis have been recently recognized
(19). Disruption of structural or sequence motifs recognized by these proteins may affect the
interaction of miRNA precursors with proteins and, consequently, miRNA biogenesis.
Therefore, we employed recently developed by one of us (M.O.U.T) miRNAmotif software (59)
to investigate whether the identified mutations disrupt or create known sequence motifs
recognized by the following regulatory proteins: hnRNPA1, HuR, KSRP, Lin28, MBNL1, MCPIP1,
DGCR8, MATR3, ZC3H7, YBX1, TRIM71, PTBP1/3, DDX17, RBFOX, SMAD, CELF1/2, and ZC3H10.
The analysis led to the identification of 84 mutations disrupting 55 motifs and creating 54
motifs (some mutations affected more than one motif) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3).
In our study, the most frequently affected sequence motifs were UGU and VCAUCH recognized
by the DGCR8 and DDX17 regulatory proteins, respectively.
Identification of hotspot miRNA genes
Analysis of the mutation distribution over the analyzed regions showed that 8 (miR-890, miR664b, miR-1297, miR-379, miR-1324, miR-892a, miR-887, and miR-509-3) and 2 (miR-527 and
miR-592) hotspot miRNA genes were significantly overmutated in LUAD and LUSC,
respectively (Table 3). To further evaluate the reliability of the identified hotspot miRNA
genes, we re-calculated mutation enrichment significance, weighting the mutation
occurrences by the following factors: 2x, mutations in seeds; 1.5x, mutations in miRNAs
(guide-strand only); 1.5x, mutations affecting the functional motifs or DROSHA/DICER
cleavage sites; 1x, other mutations. As shown in Table 3 the p-value calculated based on the
weighted-mutation values further decreased for 8 hotspot-miRNA-genes, including the miR509-3, miR-1324 and miR-379 genes with an excess of mutations affecting the mature miRNA
and functional motif sequences. Eight of the 10 hotspot miRNA genes were defined as high
confidence in either miRBase or miRGeneDB. As shown in Figure 4, there were no specific
hotspot mutations but rather randomly distributed mutations over the sequences of hotspot
miRNA genes. An exception may be the miR-890 and miR-887 gene, in which most mutations

clustered within the DROSHA cleavage site and basal stem junction in the 5’ flanking region,
respectively. Analysis of the expression of particular miRNAs showed that miR-887 levels in all
mutated samples were below the median of this miRNA in LUAD (Supplementary Figure S4).
A similar observation was made for mutations in the miR-664b gene, whereas mutations in
other hotspot miRNA genes showed a more or less random distribution over the range of
miRNA expression levels.
The co-mutation plot shown in Figure 5A presents the basic clinical and
epidemiological characteristics of cancers with mutations in miRNA genes (emphasizing
mutations in hotspot miRNA genes). The formal analysis (Supplementary Table S4), although
of low statistical power, showed an association of miR-890 gene mutations with earlier tumor
stage (LUAD: stage I-II vs. III-IV, p=0.019), more frequent mutations in the miR-887 gene in
males (p=0.045), and a borderline significant correlation of miR-664b gene mutations with
lower cigarette-per-day-smoking in LUAD. However, due to the low number of mutations in
particular hotspot miRNA genes, the abovementioned associations must be interpreted
cautiously and cannot be generalized without further validation.
As shown in Figure 5B, although mutations in hotspot miRNA genes and known driver
genes are not mutually exclusive, a substantial fraction of mutations in hotspot miRNA genes
occurred in samples with no driver gene mutations.
Somatic mutations may affect miRNA precursor structure
Another consequence of mutations in miRNA genes are structural changes that can be caused
by mutations in any subregion of the miRNA precursor. Using mutations in the hotspot miRNA
genes as examples, we compared the secondary and spatial structures of wild-type and
mutant miRNA precursors. The structure prediction was performed with the use of the mfold
(60) and RNAComposer (61) software. This analysis showed that most mutations
(substitutions) induced subtle, local changes, but some caused more severe deformations of
the structure (Figure 6). An example of a mutation that induced serious structural aberrations
in the hairpin structure of miRNA precursor is n.57C>A in the 3’ arm of pre-miR-664b (Figure
6A). Such mutations very likely affect miRNA biogenesis (processing by cellular RNases).
Mutations that introduced enlarged internal loops, e.g., n.20G>T and n.58T>A in the miR-664b
precursor and n.66G>T and n.21G>A in the miR-890 precursor although do not affect
substantially the secondary structure of the precursors, may increase the flexibility of the helix
axis, manifested by changes in the geometry of 3D structure. Changes in the predicted

secondary structure, which affect pre-miRNA stability, are not always manifested in spatial
geometry, as shown for the n.60T>C mutation in the miR-890 precursor, which caused the loss
of two nucleotide internal loops and increased the rigidity of the precursor stem but did not
affect the 3D structure of the precursor.
Experimental identification of mutations in hotspot miRNA genes
In the next step, we used Sanger sequencing to screen a small group of ~60 NSCLC samples
for mutations in three of the identified hotspot miRNA genes, i.e., the most frequently
mutated miR-890, and the most frequently annotated with cancer related functions miR-379
and miR-1297 genes (Table 3). In total, we detected 5 sequence variants (Supplementary
Figure S5 and Supplementary Table S5). Among the identified sequence variants was n.66G>C
in the miR-890 gene, identified in the hemizygous state in 3 independent cancer samples
(Supplementary Figure S5A). The mutation is located in the 3’ arm of the precursor, next to
the predicted DROSHA cleavage site, at the same position as a mutation identified in the TCGA
cohort (n.66G>T). Additionally, mutations (n.1-18A>G) in the 5’ flanking region of the miR-890
gene were detected in two other samples. Besides that a single mutation (n.77+26C>T) in 3’
flanking region, 36 nucleotides upstream of the predicted pre-miRNA sequence was detected.
Mutations were also found in the miR-379 gene, one (n.13C>A) in the seed region
(Supplementary Figure S3A and Supplementary Figure S5B) and the other (n.1-37C>T) in the
5’ flanking region, 42 nucleotides upstream of the predicted pre-miRNA sequence. As we do
not have access to corresponding normal DNA samples, we cannot unambiguously confirm
the somatic status of the identified changes.

DISCUSSION
Cancer development is associated with the accumulation of numerous genetic aberrations,
including point mutations, CNVs, and copy number-neutral genomic rearrangements. Most of
these alterations are neutral (passenger) changes occurring randomly throughout the
genome, but others may be cancer-driving mutations. The accumulation of such mutations in
a particular gene or the recurrent occurrence of a particular mutation may indicate its
importance in cancer development. To date, many driver genes/mutations have been
identified, some of which are utilized as biomarkers in personalized cancer therapy (62).
Prominent examples include EGFR mutations in lung cancer and JAK2 mutations in

myeloproliferative disorders (63,64). So far, most of the attention has been on the analysis of
protein-coding genes; therefore, the majority of experimental approaches and bioinformatics
algorithms used for somatic mutation detection and identification of potential driver signals
are not well suited for non-protein-coding parts of the genome. The limitations of tools
dedicated to the analysis of genetic variation in non-coding sections of the genome (~99%)
and thus the limited number of studies focusing on these regions were recently described and
discussed (34,65). It should also be noted that a recent increase in interest in non-coding
genomic variation, most likely inspired by the identification of highly recurrent mutations in
the promoter of the TERT gene in melanoma and other cancers (66), is focused mostly on
regions playing a role in DNA:protein interactions (e.g., promoters and enhancers) (65).
Considering the role of miRNAs in regulating gene expression, it can be presumed that
somatic mutations may affect numerous cellular processes through changes in miRNA
functionality. Somatic mutations in miRNA genes may manifest as aberrations in miRNA:target
interactions induced predominantly by mutations in the miRNA guide strand sequence,
especially but not exclusively in the seed region (67), or as aberrations in miRNA biogenesis
caused either by mutations in essential regulatory motifs or mutations affecting miRNA
precursor structure. Somatic mutations in miRNA genes may, therefore, cripple or enhance
their silencing properties or create new miRNAs, i.e., miRNAs recognizing new targets. Thus,
the accumulation of somatically acquired gain- or loss-of-function mutations in a specific
miRNA gene may benefit cancer development and progression.
In this study, we detected 1091 mutations in 521 miRNA genes (Figure 1A) and showed
that approximately 50% of the analyzed cancers had at least one mutation in at least one
miRNA gene. Our results show that such mutations are generally spread throughout the
genome, even though some chromosomes were overmutated (Chr14 and Chr19) or
undermutated (Chr1 and Chr2). To better understand the potential function of the identified
mutations, we characterized them with respect to localization in different subregions of
miRNA precursors, influence on miRNA precursor secondary and tertiary structures, impact
on sequence motifs bound by different proteins that participate in miRNA maturation and
changes in mature miRNA:target interactions.
Our analysis identified well-recognized suppressormiRs or oncomiRs among the miRNA
genes with somatic mutations. Examples of the mutated suppressormiR genes may be the Let7a-2, let-7c, and let-7e genes belonging to the let-7 family, known to have tumor suppressor

function by repressing cell proliferation and regulating the cell cycle (68) and the miR-205
gene, which inhibits cancer progression by suppressing EMT and accelerates cancer
development by facilitating tumor initiation and proliferation (69,70). The same n.35C>T
mutation in the miR-205 seed sequence was observed in two samples in our studies (Figure 3
and Supplementary Figure S3B). Mutations were also found in genes encoding known
oncomiRs, such as the miR-21, miR-155 genes and in the genes (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-20a,
R19b-1, and miR-92a-1) belonging to the miR-17-92 cluster, also known as OncomiR-1 (71)
(Supplementary Table S2). Finally, mutations were also detected in the miR-143 gene, which
encodes the most abundantly expressed miRNA (accounting for ~30% of all expressed
miRNAs) and, next to miR-21, contribute to the greatest changes (decreases) in miRNA levels
in most cancer types (72).
Among the mutated miRNA genes, we identified a group of ten hotspot miRNA genes
that were significantly overmutated in either LUAD or LUSC samples. The fact that 80% of
hotspot miRNA genes (64% of all mutated miRNA genes) but only 45% of all analyzed miRNA
genes were assigned as high confidence according to miRBase and/or miRGeneDB supports
the reliability of our findings. The dispersed distribution of mutations over the hotspot miRNA
genes (without specific hotspot mutations) is consistent with the pattern of loss-of-function
mutations typically observed in suppressor genes (73). This finding coincides with previous
results (summarized in Table 3) suggesting that most hotspot miRNAs act as suppressormiRs.
An example is miR-379, which downregulates MDM2, thus preventing the ubiquitination and
degradation of p53 (74); PDK1, which is the convergence point of cancer signaling pathways
such as the PI3K/Akt, Ras/MAPK and Myc pathways (75); and COX-2, which inhibits the
transition from acute to chronic inflammation and thereby prevents cancer initiation and
progression (76). An exceptional mutation distribution pattern was the accumulation of
mutations in a basal region of the miR-887 gene and the introduction of a basal UG motif,
which may be associated with the oncogene-like pattern of mutations resulting in accelerated
pre-miRNA processing and thus an elevated level of this miRNA in cells. Increased levels of
miR-887 were previously reported in endometrial and rectal cancer (77,78). In contrast, other
authors have demonstrated that miR-887 may act as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer,
breast cancer and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (79-81). We have shown that mutations in
miRNA genes and known cancer driver genes are not mutually exclusive, but a substantial
number of miRNA gene mutations were identified in samples without mutations in known

protein-coding drivers. We also showed that mutations in some hotspot miRNA genes
correlated with different epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cancer and that miR887 and miR-664b gene mutations were associated with lower expression of these specific
miRNAs. Nevertheless, the statistical power of these analyses was low (low number of
mutations in a particular gene), and therefore, the determination of whether the identified
hotspot miRNA genes have cancer-driver potential requires further statistical and
experimental validation. On the other hand, even if the detected mutations are not primary
drivers, they may still play a role in cancer. It was recently shown that passenger mutations
may both prevent further cancer progression (82) and cooperate in driving cancer
development and drug resistance (83,84).
Somatic mutations in the miRNA duplex lead to altered miRNA:target interactions
(Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S6) and also may affect miRNA maturation by changing
the precursor structure (Figure 6). For example, the n.66G>T mutation in the 3’ arm of the
miR-890 precursor destabilizes the duplex structure and enlarges the internal loop at the
predicted DROSHA cleavage site. This mutation may affect DROSHA cleavage or change its
specificity. It was shown before that the G>C substitution (SNP rs138166791) located at the
same position significantly decreases the effectiveness of pre-miRNA processing and the level
of mature miRNA (46). Additionally, as we have previously shown, such nucleotide
substitutions may alter DROSHA cleavage specificity and may change the pool of generated
isomiRs (85-87). Interestingly, although the minor allele of this SNP is very rare (<1% in the
GnomAD, TOPMED, ExAC, and 1000G databases), we detected this allele as a hemizygous
variant in 3 of ~60 lung cancer samples in our experimental analysis.
We have also shown that somatic mutations in miRNA genes may affect (destroy or
create) sequence motifs recognized by proteins playing a role in miRNA maturation. The most
frequently gained sequence motifs were the VCAUCH and UGU motifs recognized by DDX17
and DGCR8, respectively. Both motifs are important for proper pri-miRNA recognition and
processing by DROSHA. Another frequently created motif was the UGC motif that is bound by
MCPIP1, which antagonizes DICER and terminates miRNA biosynthesis via cleavage of the premiRNA terminal loop and via further precursor degradation (88). The DGCR8-binding motif
was also the most frequently lost due to somatic mutation, followed by the CAGAC motif,
which is recognized by SMAD and enhances pri-miRNA processing by the microprocessor
complex. Additionally, TGF-β-stimulated SMAD may enhance the transcription of miRNA13

coding genes by binding to their promoters (89,90). As shown in Figure 4, mutations may also
affect the SRSF3-binding CNNC motif involved in pri-miRNA processing (91).
In contrast to the numerous approaches/algorithms for identifying driver
genes/mutations in protein-coding genes (e.g., MutSig2CV, HotSpot 3D, CLUMPS, PARADIGM,
HotNet2, e-Driver and 20/20+) (92,93)), which take advantage of predictable consequences of
mutations in affected proteins, the identification of drivers in non-protein-coding regions is
limited to the analysis of mutation frequency/distribution in a region of interest. The challenge
in identifying driver mutations in non-coding regions stems mostly from the lack of a simple
code (such as the protein code) that would allow one to predict the function of mutations and
to distinguish deleterious from benign or neutral mutations. Approaches such as MutSigNC
and LARVA, which utilize analysis of background mutation distribution, were recently modified
for the identification of non-coding drivers, but they remain mostly limited to regions such as
promoters, enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites (65). To the best of our
knowledge, there is currently no tool dedicated to the automated and statistically supported
identification of driver mutations in miRNA genes. Therefore, our results, as well as the
recently published tool ADmiRE (34), may help to prioritize potentially functional mutations
and to develop a better algorithm for the identification of driver mutations in regions coding
for non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs. For example, an analysis of mutations in hotspot
miRNA genes detected in this study showed that excess mutations in the miR-509-3 gene
occur in the mature miRNA sequences and that those in the miR-887 gene affect regulatory
sequence motifs.
In summary, in this study involving WES data from human lung tumors, we revealed a
plethora of somatic mutations within miRNA genes and addressed their potential functional
consequences. Although our results must be further evaluated and experimentally validated,
they provide a good starting point for discussion and further research on the development of
miRNA gene-dedicated computational approaches, which may help elucidate the role of
somatic miRNA gene mutations in cancer in the future. Our findings may be helpful in cracking
the code of so-called non-coding DNA and may contribute to fully understanding the role of
miRNAs in cancer development and to examining many yet unexplored parts of the genome.

METHODS
Data resources
We used molecular and clinical data (Level 2) for LUAD and LUSC generated and deposited in
the TCGA repository (http://cancergenome.nih.gov). These data included results of somatic
mutation calls in WES datasets of 569 LUAD and 479 LUSC (and matched normal) samples
preprocessed through the standard TCGA pipeline. We analyzed annotated somatic mutations
with corresponding clinical information and miRNA expression data.
Data processing
We analyzed somatic mutations in 1642 miRNA gene regions (Supplementary Table S1)
including 1600 regions covered by the probes used for exome enrichment (SureSelect, Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) and 42 regions co-captured during library enrichment but not directly
covered by the SureSelect probes. The miRNA genes cover extended pre-miRNA-coding
sequences, including 25 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the pre-miRNA-coding
sequence. Pre-miRNA-coding sequences were reconstructed based on 5’ and 3’ mature
miRNA coordinates annotated in miRBase v.21 (in cases when only one miRNA strand was
indicated in miRBase, the other pre-miRNA end was predicted assuming the pre-miRNA
hairpin structure with a 2-nt 3’ overhang). According to the number of reads generated from
the particular pre-miRNA arm (miRBase), the analyzed precursors were classified into one of
3 categories: (i) pre-miRNAs generating mature miRNA predominantly from the 5’ arm (≥90%
of reads from the 5’ arm); (ii) pre-miRNAs generating mature miRNA predominantly from the
3’ arm (≥90% of reads from the 3’ arm); and balanced pre-miRNAs (>10% of reads from each
arm). To validate the accuracy of the identified miRNA gene mutations (assumed
threshold/filters), we also analyzed the occurrence of somatic point mutations in selected
hotspot exons of well-known NSCLC driver genes (9), i.e., KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, HRAS, NRAS,
MAP2K1, MET, ERBB2, RIT1, and NF1 (Supplementary Table S1).
Some analyses (indicated in the text) were performed on a narrowed list of highconfidence miRNA genes defined either in miRBase v.22 (n=616) or MiRGeneDB (n=521). The
precursors deposited in MiRGeneDB are defined based on criteria that include careful
annotation of the mature versus passenger miRNA strands and evaluation of evolutionary
hierarchy; therefore, they are much more conservative than those in miRBase (58).

From the WES data generated with the use of four different algorithms (MuSE,
MuTect2, VarScan2, and SomaticSniper), we extracted somatic mutation calls with PASS
annotation. The extraction was performed with a set of in-house Python scripts
(https://github.com/martynaut/mirnaome_somatic_mutations).

To

avoid

duplicating

mutations detected in multiple datasets associated with the same patient, we combined files
summing reads associated with particular mutations. The lists of mutations detected by
different algorithms were merged such that mutations detected by more than one algorithm
were not multiplicated. To further increase the reliability of the identified mutations (and
avoid the identification of uncertain mutations), we removed mutations that did not fulfill the
following criteria: (i) at least two mutation-supporting reads in a tumor sample (if no
mutation-supporting read was detected in the corresponding normal sample); (ii) at least 5x
higher frequency of mutation-supporting reads in the tumor sample than in the corresponding
normal sample; (iii) somatic score parameter (SSC) > 30 (for VarScan2 and SomaticSniper); and
(iv) base quality (BQ) parameter for mutation-supporting reads in the tumor sample > 20 (for
MuSE and MuTect2). These additional criteria resulted in the exclusion of 193 mutations in
miRNA genes and 93 mutations in cancer driver genes. Finally, the average sequencing depth
of the identified mutations in miRNA genes was ~290 for LUAD and ~313 for LUSC. In 15 LUAD
and 10 LUSC samples, two somatic mutations were detected within one miRNA gene.
Although we could not distinguish whether such mutations occurred on one or two different
alleles, for simplicity, we treated each of these pairs of mutations as one complex mutation.
All mutations were designated according to HGVS nomenclature in reference to coordinates
of corresponding miRNA precursors specified in miRBase v.21.
Statistics
Unless stated otherwise, all statistical analyses were performed with statistical functions in
the Python module scipy.stats. Particular statistical tests are indicated in the text, and p<0.05
was considered significant. If necessary, p-values were corrected for multiple tests with the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (http://biostathandbook.com/multiplecomparisons.html).
Hotspot miRNA genes were identified based on the probability of occurrence of the observed
number of mutations, which was calculated with the use of 2-tailed binomial distribution
(VassarStats: web site for statistical computation http://vassarstats.net/), assuming a
background random occurrence of identified mutations in all analyzed miRNA genes and
considering the miRNA gene length.

Target, structure, and miRNA motif predictions
Target predictions were performed with the TargetScan Custom (release 5.2) on-line tool (94),
and the results are presented as area-proportional Venn diagrams (95).
The secondary structures of miRNA precursors were predicted using mfold software with
default parameters. Three-dimensional structural predictions of pre-miRNA stem-loop
structures were generated using RNAComposer software with default parameters (61) and
visualized in PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC).
To identify mutations affecting sequence motifs recognized by pre-miRNA-interacting
proteins, we modified miRNAmotif software (https://github.com/martynaut/mirnamotif,
(59)), which is dedicated to the identification of sequence motifs in wild-type pre-miRNA
sequences. As miRNAmotif utilizes coordinates of pre-miRNA sequences deposited in
miRBase, we did not analyze the effect of mutations in sequence outside the coordinates, and
we analyzed only substitutions. For proteins known to interact with loop structures of premiRNAs, we performed a search in the loop sequence only (in miRNAmotif this sequence is
referred to as the linking sequence). The motif search was performed in the 5’-3’ direction.
Lung sample screening
For the experimental identification of mutations in the miR-890, miR-379, and miR-1297
genes, we analyzed DNA from 84 tumor samples (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) with
histopathologically confirmed NSCLC diagnosed at the Franciszek Lukaszczyk Oncology Center
in Bydgoszcz (central Poland). The study was approved by the Committee of Ethics of Scientific
Research of Collegium Medicum of Nicolaus Copernicus University, Poland (KB 42/2018). The
data were analyzed anonymously. The appropriate genomic fragments were amplified by PCR
using the following primers: miR-890 gene: F-5’GAACAAGCTCGTTTTCTGTTCTT3’, R5’CAGTGGGCTGGAAATTCTCT3’ (444 bp product, annealing temperature 60°C); miR-379 gene
F-5’CAAATCCAGCCTCAGAAAGC3’, R-5’TGGAGCAGTGCTGAAGCTAA3’ (246 bp, 60°C); and miR1297 gene F-5’TCAAGGGTGATAAGAAAGAGGA3’, R-5’GATTTTCATAGGACAACATCTTCA3’ (250
bp, 58°C). PCR was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (GoTaq DNA
polymerase protocol, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). All PCR products were purified using the
EPPIC Fast kit (A&A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland) and sequenced directly using the BigDye
v3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and an ABI PRISM 3130xl genetic analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). High-quality PCR products of the miR-890, miR-

Figure 2. Distribution of somatic mutations within miRNA precursors. A) An overview of a
primary miRNA transcript with indicated subregions considered in the study. The miRNA
duplex is indicated in blue, and sequence consensus motifs recognized as enhancers of miRNA
biogenesis are represented by green circles. B) and C) The distribution of substitutions in the
subregions of miRNA precursors for LUAD and LUSC samples, respectively. miRNA duplex
positions are indicated in blue, seed regions in navy blue, and flanking regions and terminal
positions of the apical loop in gray. The numbers in the lower-right corner represent the
number of plotted substitutions (upper) and the number of mutated miRNA genes (lower).
Analyses were also performed in narrowed groups of miRNAs that preferentially release the
guide miRNA strand from the 5’ or 3’ arm (below). If present, mutations localized beyond
position 22 in miRNA are shown cumulatively at position 22. As the size and structure of loops
differ substantially among miRNA precursors, the mutation density maps do not show
mutations located inside the loops.
