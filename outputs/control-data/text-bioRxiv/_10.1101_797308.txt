Short Title: PMK-3 and ESCRT proteins control life extension following ETC stress

ABSTRACT
The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) PMK-3 controls a life-extending retrograde response
in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that is activated following mitochondrial electron transport
chain (ETC) disruption and is distinct from known longevity-promoting pathways. Here we show that
the long isoform of PMK-3 expressed exclusively in the gut, rather than neurons, is sufficient to fully
extend the life of animals exposed to mild ETC dysfunction. Surprisingly, constitutive activation of
PMK-3 using a gain-of-function MAP3K/DLK-1 mutant does not extend the life of wild-type worms
due to dampening of the DLK-1/PMK-3 signaling axis with age. We further show that core components
of the ESCRT-III machinery, including ISTR-1, CHMP2B (CC01A4.2) and RAB-11.1, are required for
life extension following ETC disruption. ESCRT proteins are needed for extracellular vesicle (EV)
formation, lysosomal traffic and other functions requiring membrane encapsulation away from the
cytoplasm. Together, our findings underscore PMK-3 as a pivotal factor controlling life extension in

INTRODUCTION
Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated to some degree in the etiology of most of the major agerelated diseases of the Western World, including cancer, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
diseases, osteoporosis and obstructive lung disease (reviewed in (1)). Even in the absence of disease,
mitochondrial function declines with age (2). The pronounced role of mitochondria in the pathogenesis
of multiple diseases is a consequence of their function in an extensive list of essential cellular processes.
For example, the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) alone generates up to 90% of cellular
ATP (3). Other important functions of mitochondria include calcium sequestration (4), Fe-S cluster
formation (5) and nucleotide biosynthesis (6). Due to the central importance of mitochondria, their
functional status is closely monitored within cells (7). In this regard, signals called “retrograde
responses” originate from compromised mitochondria and act within the nucleus to coordinate adaptive

gene expression changes to resolve or reduce mitochondrial stress. Higher eucaryotes have evolved
different kinds of retrograde responses that are triggered by a variety of stressors, including protein
aggregation (8), changes in ETC activity (9), oxidative stress (10) and loss of iron (11). One innovative
approach to countering age-related decline of mitochondrial function is to exploit retrograde responses
to prophylactically protect, or even rejuvenate, the mitochondrial network. Retrograde responses might
therefore represent an untapped means by which to potentially ameliorate multiple age-related diseases
simultaneously.
Responses that counteract mitochondrial ETC disruption have been most extensively studied in
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (9, 12-16). Several years ago, we showed that the response of C.
elegans to mitochondrial ETC dysfunction is threshold-dependent. That is, low levels of stress produce
no phenotype, moderate levels increase lifespan, while severe disruption, as in humans, leads to overt
pathology and shortened lifespan (13). Recently, we described a novel retrograde response in C. elegans
that extended life and did not overlap with known longevity-promoting pathways (17). This retrograde
response operates independently of the well-characterized ATFS-1-dependent mitochondrial unfolded
protein response (18), the NRF2/SKN-1-dependent anti-oxidant response (19), as well as a variety of
other tested pathways. The core of this signaling pathway consists of a new mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) cascade composed of DLK-1 (MAP3K), SEK-3 (MAP2K), and PMK-3 (p38 MAPK).
Each of these are needed for life extension following exposure to mild ETC disruption. Little or nothing
is known regarding in which tissues these molecules promote longevity, or the mechanisms by which
they operate other than that an unconventional β-tubulin, TBB-6, becomes 70-fold overexpressed when
the pathway responds to mitochondrial ETC disruption (17). In this study, we leveraged this sensitive
physiological indicator to define the tissues and molecular mechanisms by which this novel MAPK
signaling cascade functions and identify a new role for the membrane remodeling ESCRT-III machinery
in promoting ETC stress-induced longevity.

PMK-3(L) was generated under contract by Life Technologies Corporation (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Antibody production details, as well as sensitivity- and specificity testing, are described in S1 Text.
Homology Modeling. A model of PMK-3(L) was built via the CPHmodels-3.3(beta) homology
modeling server. Human p38α (PDB structure 1R3C) served as the model-building template. Only
amino acids 110-459 of PMK-3(L) were included in the final model. Full details are provided in S1

qRT-PCR Analysis of Endocytosis Gene Set. cDNA was prepared from one-day old adult
worms cultured on relevant RNAi plates from the L1 larval stage onward. qPCR was performed using
SYBR Green and a StepOnePlus Real Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Changes in mRNA
expression of endocytosis-related genes was calculated using the ΔΔCt method and pmp-3 as
housekeeping gene control. Statistical significance was assessed using a one-tailed Student’s t-test. Full
details of our qRT-PCR procedure, including all primer sequences, is provided in S1 Text.

RESULTS
As PMK-3 is the most distal kinase of the new MAPK cascade controlling ETC dysfunctioninduced longevity in C. elegans, we sought to understand its role in greater detail. The pmk-3 gene is
predicted to encode four mRNA splice variants generating two protein isoforms, 300 and 474 amino
acids (αα) in length (http://www.wormbase.org, WS272, Sep. 2019, Fig. 1A). Hereafter, we refer to
these two protein isoforms as PMK-3 short (S) and PMK-3 long (L), respectively. The evidence which
supports existence of transcripts encoding PMK-3(S) is weak and is derived from a single expressed
sequence tag (www.wormbase.org, yk1033d01) that was computationally extended upstream to the most
proximal 5’ ATG.
To test which isoform is required for mediating retrograde response signaling, we began by
generating recombinant clones of each isoform under the control of the ubiquitous eft-3 promoter and
microinjected them into PMK-3 deficient pmk-3(tm745) worms. Previous studies have reported pmk-3 is
ubiquitously expressed (28); the eft-3 promoter thus provides a control for the maximum degree of
rescue mediated via expression from a transgenic array. As a PMK-3 antibody is not commercially
available, we generated antisera to PMK-3 for testing expression of each transgene (S1 Text, see also
Figs. S1-S3). Western analysis of whole-worm extracts revealed that while the long isoform of PMK-3
was robustly expressed, the short isoform could not be reliably detected (Figs. 1B, S4A and S4B).

Structural modeling suggests PMK-3(S) is likely a computational artifact
To further explore why PMK-3(S) remained undetectable even when overexpressed using a
constitutive promoter, we turned to structural modeling. p38 MAPKs are comprised of two domains: an
N-terminal domain composed largely of β-sheet (~ 135 residues) and a C-terminal domain that is mostly
helical (~225 residues). The catalytic site is formed by the juncture of the two domains (29). Homology
modeling of PMK-3(L) using the crystal structure of human p38α showed that the PMK-3(S) truncation

removed half of the N-terminal core domain, including residues critical for ATP chelation (Fig. 1C).
Such a severe truncation is unlikely to result in a catalytically functional protein and, given our inability
to detect this protein, we believe PMK-3(S) is most likely a computationally inaccurate prediction of
Wormbase. We therefore used the long isoform for all further experiments.
Structural modeling of PMK-3(L) also revealed a striking additional feature of this protein that is
not immediately apparent from its primary sequence: non-conservative amino acid substitutions that
distinguish PMK-3 from both PMK-1 and PMK-2 (Fig. S5) decorate half its surface (red, Fig. 1D). In
other words, while the internal kinase core of PMK-3(L) remains almost identical to that of its two
paralogs, PMK-3’s surface has evolved new textures that presumably correspond to binding interfaces
for unique binding partners, such as upstream kinases and factors that control its subcellular localization.
This finding underscores the uniqueness of PMK-3 and is presumably the reason why PMK-3 alone, and
not any other MAPK in worms (17), controls the novel longevity-promoting retrograde response that we
are currently studying.

Tissue-specific expression of PMK-3 results in retrograde response activation in gut cells
To investigate which tissue the DLK-1/SEK-3/PMK-3 signaling cascade acts in, we expressed
PMK-3(L) under the control of either a ubiquitous (eft-3), gut-specific (vha-6), or neuron-specific (rgef1) promoter. We have previously reported that GFP coupled to the promoter of tbb-6 (Ptbb-6::GFP)
functions as a robust surrogate marker of PMK-3-dependent retrograde response activation following
disruption of the mitochondrial ETC. This reporter is strongly induced in gut cells, while weaker
expression is also observed in several unidentified head neurons (17). The tissue-specific PMK-3
constructs were therefore injected into pmk-3(tm745);Ptbb-6::GFP worms to evaluate their capacity to
activate GFP expression. All constructs contained a downstream SL2 trans-spliced mCherry reporter for
validation of transgene expression. Transgenes were maintained as extrachromosomal arrays and

siblings that lost the array served as negative controls. Relevant strain names used throughout this study
and their full genotypic information is provided in Table S1.
All constructs induced robust mCherry expression in the appropriate tissue in accord with its
respective promoter (Fig. 2A-C). After verifying transgene expression in worms by western blot (Fig.
S4A,B), the ability of each transgene to allow retrograde signaling in response to mitochondrial stress
was evaluated. ETC stress was imposed through bacterial feeding RNAi targeting complex III (isp-1)
(13, 16, 17). Expression of PMK-3 under all three promoters permitted robust Ptbb-6::GFP induction
(Fig. 2A-C).
Surprisingly, GFP was expressed solely in the gut in each case, despite bright neuronal mCherry
expression with both the ubiquitous eft-3 promoter (Fig. 2A) and the neuron-specific rgef-1 promoter
(Fig. 2C). Initially the result with the rgef-1 promoter seemed to imply cell non-autonomous signaling
traveling from the neurons to the gut. However, closer inspection of this line revealed that the rgef-1
promoter was leaking expression in gut tissue (Fig. 2D, Fig. S6A). When we re-engineered our
construct to contain a small decoy open reading frame (ORF) 5’ of the PMK-3 start site in an effort to
reduce potential bleed through transcription (S1 Text, Fig. S6B), we still observed mis-expression of
mCherry in gut cells. Finally, use of the rab-3 promoter, another widely used neuron-specific promoter,
and also re-engineered to contain a small decoy ORF to combat potential bleed through transcription,
again resulted in translation of mCherry in gut tissue. We therefore conclude that these models of
neuron-specific gene expression are unreliable. Nonetheless, they clearly show that despite expression of
PMK-3 in the neurons, retrograde signaling is not activated in this tissue.
Since we have previously reported a constitutively active form of DLK-1 is fully capable of
functioning in neurons to cell-autonomously activate Ptbb-6::GFP expression (17), our findings suggest
neurons are recalcitrant to feeding RNAi, consistent with other studies. In summary, we conclude that
PMK-3(L) restricted to the gut is sufficient to mediate mitochondrial stress-induced retrograde response
signaling. We also find no evidence that neurons are required to signal cell non-autonomously to

activate the PMK-3 retrograde response in gut cells; rather, all evidence points to intestinal cells
autonomously activating this pathway. Further accentuating the role of intestinal PMK-3 in responding
to ETC stress, worms that express PMK-3 either ubiquitously or just in the gut, indistinguishably exhibit
Ptbb-6::GFP reporter gene induction only in gut cells when exposed to atp-3 feeding RNAi targeting
mitochondrial complex V (compare Fig. 2E and 2F).

Life extension following isp-1 feeding RNAi is fully restored by gut-specific PMK-3(L) expression
Since we observed PMK-3 retrograde response signaling was restricted to the gut following mild
mitochondrial ETC dysfunction induced by isp-1 feeding RNAi, we next investigated whether activation
of this pathway in this tissue was sufficient to extend life. We measured the survival of worms with and
without various PMK-3 arrays following exposure to two different doses of isp-1 RNAi (1/10 and 1/2
strength). Both concentrations of isp-1 RNAi are sufficient to lengthen the life of wild-type worms in a
dose-dependent manner, a response that is severely blunted in pmk-3(tm745) mutants, as previously
reported (Fig. 3A).
Strikingly, PMK-3(L) expressed just in the gut permitted both doses of isp-1 RNAi to extend the
life of pmk-3(tm745) mutants to the same extent as ubiquitously-expressed PMK-3(L) (Fig. 3B, C). This
result was replicated using an independently-generated Pvha-6::PMK-3(L)-containing strain (Fig. S7A).
This limited need for only gut-specific PMK-3(L) became further apparent when the same set of strains
were exposed to bacterial feeding RNAi targeting atp-3. In wild-type worms, severe knockdown of atp3 results in pathological shortening of life, in contrast to mild atp-3 knockdown which extends life (13).
In pmk-3(tm745) mutants, exposure to full strength atp-3 RNAi results in L3 larval arrest and premature
death (Fig. S7B). Re-expression of PMK-3(L) in the gut of these animals, however, leads to larval arrest
by-pass in half of the animals, doubling population survival time relative to non-array containing worms.
The degree of recovery mediated by gut-specific PMK-3(L) is again indistinguishable from the rescue
conferred by ubiquitously re-expressed PMK-3(L) under the eft-3 promoter (compare Fig. S7C and Fig.

S7D). These results further underscore the notion that the gut appears to be the primary tissue mediating
longevity signaling in worms exposed to ETC disruption.

Constitutive activation of DLK-1 in the intestine is sufficient to drive activation of stress signaling
As mentioned previously, we have shown neuronally-expressed, constitutively active DLK-1
drives Ptbb-6::GFP expression in the neurons (17). As our studies now suggest the intestine is the
primary site of longevity signaling, we asked whether constitutive DLK-1 activation in the gut could
drive retrograde signaling in the absence of ETC disruption. To do this, we coupled DLK-1b(EE), the
constitutively active form of DLK-1, to the gut-specific vha-6 promoter along with an mCherry
transcriptional reporter and injected it into Ptbb-6::GFP worms. Constitutively active, gut-specific DLK1b(EE) successfully induced Ptbb-6::GFP reporter expression in the absence of overt ETC disruption
(Fig. 4A, B). GFP fluorescence was limited to the gut, consistent with cell autonomous activation by
DLK-1b(EE).

DLK-1b(EE) overexpression did not alter endogenous PMK-3 levels beyond the

background signal detectable in worms that had lost the array (Fig. S4A, B).
We next sought to determine whether constitutive activation of PMK-3 is also sufficient to drive
life extension in the absence of mitochondrial stress. p38 MAPKs are activated by MAP2K
phosphorylation of a TGY motif (30). PMK-3 differs from most other p38 MAPKs in that its activation
loop contains a predicted TQY motif instead of the canonical TGY motif. We generated two different
double point mutations in PMK-3: AQA and EQE. These mutations are predicted to result in permanent
inactivation and activation, respectively. These mutated proteins were expressed under the eft-3
promoter. Interestingly, presence of the EQE phosphomimetic mutation in PMK-3(L) induced a
conformational alteration in the structure of the protein that caused the recombinant protein to migrate
slower by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S4A, B), much as phosphorylation often does for other MAPKs. Unlike
constitutively active DLK-1, PMK-3(L) containing the EQE phosphomimetic mutation failed to activate
Ptbb-6::GFP reporter induction under basal conditions (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly PMK-3(L) EQE also

failed to mediate Ptbb-6::GFP induction in worms exposed to isp-1 RNAi (Fig. 4A). These findings
suggest that the EQE mutation did not function as planned to induce clearance of the activation loop
from the catalytic-binding site. Instead, the sequence change appears to function as a dominant negative
and blocks natural activation of PMK-3 enzymatic activity.

The lifespan of wild-type worms is not extended when DLK-1 is constitutively activated in the
intestine in the absence of ETC stress
We next evaluated whether the activation of retrograde signaling in worms expressing
constitutively active, gut-specific DLK-1 in the absence of ETC stress corresponded to an increase in
lifespan. Unlike DLK-1b(EE) expressed in neurons where worms became sterile and died (17), we
observed no detrimental effect of overexpressing DLK-1b(EE) in the gut. However, DLK-1b(EE) was
not sufficient to drive life extension (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the presence of activated DLK-1b(EE) in the
gut did not prevent or further enhance the extension of life that is induced when animals are cultured on
isp-1 RNAi (Fig. 4C). We conclude that while DLK-1/PMK-3 signaling in intestinal cells is necessary
to extend life following mild mitochondrial ETC disruption, constitutive activation of this pathway by
DLK-1b(EE) overexpression in the gut of wild type worms is alone insufficient.

Age-dependent dampening of the DLK-1/PMK-3 signaling axis in wild type worms
One explanation for why DLK-1b(EE) overexpression is unable to extend the life of wild-type
worms is because, in the absence of mitochondrial dysfunction, this signaling pathway might become
dampened over time. In support of this possibility, we observed that activation of Ptbb-6::GFP in DLK1b(EE) overexpressing worms was robust in 3 day-old adults but markedly attenuated in 13 day-old
adults, despite strong expression of the mCherry reporter gene at both time points (Fig. 5A-C).
Strikingly, this age-dependent decrease in Ptbb-6::GFP fluorescence did not occur in animals exposed to
isp-1 RNAi (Fig. 5B, C). To test the possibility that endogenous PMK-3 becomes transcriptionally

repressed with age, we co-expressed DLK-1b(EE) and PMK-3(L) under the constitutive vha-6 promoter.
Again, despite strong mCherry signal indicating transcription for these genes is not dampened, Ptbb6::GFP fluorescence was greatly diminished with age (Fig. 5D) and lifespan was not extended (Fig.
5E). We conclude that loss of DLK-1/PMK-3 signaling with age is not due to decreased transcription of
these genes, but a yet unknown mechanism which is overcome by mild mitochondrial ETC disruption.

Post-translational regulation of PMK-3(L) following mitochondrial ETC disruption
Based on the functioning of other MAP3K-MAP2K-MAPK signaling cascades, we hypothesized
that PMK-3 is activated by phosphorylation of its TQY motif by SEK-3 following ETC stress. In
support of these predictions, we observe that gut-specific re-expression of a myc-tagged DLK-1b(EE) in
dlk-1(tm4024) knockout mutants is sufficient to permit Ptbb-6::GFP induction following ETC
disruption (Fig. S8A, B). This finding places both the start (DLK-1) and end (PMK-3) of this MAPK
signaling cascade in the same tissue. The observation that a double point mutation converting the TQY
motif to either AQA or EQE blocked the ability of PMK-3(L) to induce Ptbb-6::GFP reporter gene
expression in worms exposed to atp-3 or isp-1 knockdown also underscores the importance of these two
residues (Fig. 4A).
While we were unable to generate a phospho-PMK-3-specific antibody to directly detect PMK-3
phosphorylation following ETC stress, considerable evidence points to phosphorylation as the
mechanism of PMK-3 activation. MAPKs are inactivated by a family of enzymes called dual-specificity
phosphatases (DSPs), each of which contains a specific MAPK-interaction motif and a C-terminal
phosphatase domain that acts on both the threonine and tyrosine residues contained within the activation
loop of its target MAPK (30). vhp-1 is orthologous to the human DSP8 subfamily of DSPs which are
specific for JNK and p38 MAPKs. We have previously reported that isp-1(qm150) mutants cultured on
vhp-1 RNAi arrest as L3 larvae and that this arrest can be overcome by removal of PMK-3 (17). This
finding is consistent with PMK-3 being activated by phosphorylation on its activation loop while VHP-1

inactivates it through dephosphorylation. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of the
TQY motif of PMK-3 has been detected in a prior high-throughput analysis of the C. elegans
phosphoproteome where worms were cultured to high density in liquid media (31). This kind of growth
environment is known to be limiting for oxygen tension, mimicking the effects of ETC disruption (32).
In addition to these observations, we now also report that when pmk-3(tm745) mutants
containing the Pvha-6::PMK-3(L) transgene are cultured on bacterial feeding RNAi targeting atp-3 or
isp-1, and then whole-worm extracts assessed for changes in PMK-3(L) abundance or molecular weight,
we observe no differences relative to vector-treated worms (Fig. S4C, D). These findings argue against
ETC disruption causing acute changes in either PMK-3 translation, covalent multimerization, or protein
cleavage that might otherwise result in activation. Finally, worms containing an extrachromosomal array
encoding GFP fused in-frame to the N-terminal portion of PMK-3 and driven by its non-operonic
promoter exhibit no change in GFP fluorescence intensity or localization following isp-1 knockdown
(Fig. S9). This finding argues against PMK-3(L) being activated by means of either increased
transcription or regulated re-distribution of the protein. Substantial evidence therefore points toward
phospho-regulation of one or both residues within the TQY motif of PMK-3 as the mode by which this
kinase is activated by SEK-3 following ETC stress.

Computational identification of PMK-3-regulated targets
In order to gain insight into the PMK-3-dependent processes that mediate life extension
following ETC disruption, we used a computational approach to identify candidate downstream targets
of PMK-3 signaling. We have previously reported that the promoter of tbb-6 contains two identical
copies of a motif that is most similar in sequence to the DNA binding motif of human CCAAT/enhancer
binding protein β (C/EBPβ) (17). We showed that both copies of this motif are essential for
transcriptional induction of tbb-6 following PMK-3 activation by ETC stress. These and other studies
led us to define a consensus C/EBPβ-like motif (Fig. 6A, top), hereafter referred to as “Motif 2” in

accord with (17). For the present study, we make the working assumption that PMK-3 controls binding
of an unidentified transcription factor that recognizes Motif 2. We hypothesize, then, that Motif 2
promoter elements which remain strictly conserved across evolutionary time and which are localized to
genes encoding components of the same biochemical pathway, define mechanisms that are required for
PMK-3-mediated survival in response to ETC stress.

The cisRED database contains a collection of 158,017 novel conserved promoter motifs that
reside upstream of 3,847 conserved C. elegans transcripts, spanning some 600 million years of
nematode evolution (22). We screened this library for matches to Motif 2 and identified 206 conserved
promoter sites spread over 188 genes. Among the protein products encoded by these genes, we
discovered that components of the endocytic pathway were significantly over-represented (BenjaminiHochberg q-value 0.0025). Nine genes were associated with this biochemical pathway (Fig. 6B), all of
which have human orthologs (shown in brackets): alx-1 (ALIX), C01A2.4 (CHMP2B), istr-1 (IST1),
rab-11.1 (Rab11), rfip-1 (FIP3), rme-1 (EHD3), ups-50 (UBPY), vps-2 (CHMP2A) and vps-32.1
(CHMP4C). Intriguingly, five of the nine genes encode subunits of the endosomal sorting complexes
required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) complex, which plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of
multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and, in association with RAB-11, exosome and ectosome formation (33).
Both of these latter structures are used for communication between cells (34). The consensus promoter
sequence for each of the nine genes that match Motif 2 is shown in Fig. 6A (upper panel). Orthologous
genes present in the cisRED database that contributed to each consensus sequence are shown in Fig. 6C
(upper panel), along with the evolutionary relationship between the nematode species from which these
orthologs are derived (lower panel). We conclude that a signaling pathway utilizing Motif 2 has been
conserved for at least 100 million years of nematode evolution to control endosomal trafficking (Fig.
6B).

Experimental validation of PMK-3-regulated targets
To determine the biological relevance of our findings, we tested if the expression of each of the
nine endocytic pathway genes identified above was enhanced by mitochondrial ETC disruption. We also
tested if, like tbb-6, these newly identified genes exhibited transcriptional independence from ATFS-1.
To do this we utilized a published microarray dataset (S1 Text), with many of the genes we tested being
represented by multiple primer sequences. We confirmed that seven of the nine genes exhibited
significant upregulation following mitochondrial disruption induced by spg-7 feeding RNAi, in a
manner that was independent of atfs-1 (Fig. 6D).
We next focused on four of the most strongly responsive genes: alx-1, C01A2.4 (CHMP2B),
istr-1 and rab-11.1. We tested whether their removal in wild-type worms blocked the life extension that
is normally observed when these animals are placed on isp-1 feeding RNAi. Remarkably, we observed
that knockdown of istr-1 completely abolished life extension under these circumstances (Fig. 7A), an
effect that was not due to reduced RNAi efficacy (Fig. S10 and S1 Text). Likewise, knockdown of rab11.1 also completely abolished life extension following ETC disruption by isp-1 feeding RNAi.
However, rab-11.1 knockdown caused worms to die much earlier in the absence of ETC stress (Fig.
7A). Knockdown of C01A2.4 induced a small but significant reduction in life extension following
exposure to ETC disruption, and had no effect in the absence of ETC stress (Fig. 7A). Finally, we
observed no effect of alx-1 knockdown on isp-1 RNAi-induced life extension, though lifespan was
shortened under basal conditions (Fig. 7A).
To formally test whether PMK-3 mediates the downstream activation of the nine endocytic
pathway genes identified from the cisRED database in response to mitochondrial ETC disruption, we
measured mRNA expression of these genes in worms either containing or lacking a functional pmk-3
locus and following growth on isp-1 feeding RNAi. Strong isp-1 knockdown resulted in a significant
increase in the abundance of six endocytic genes (C01A2.4 (CHMP2B), istr-1, rab-11.1, ups-50, vps-2
and vps-32.1) in a pmk-3 dependent manner (Fig. 7B). To assess whether these changes in mRNA

populations were functionally relevant at the protein level, we generated translational reporter genes
corresponding to alx-1, C01A2.4(CHMP2B), and istr-1 fused to GFP and then expressed them as “third
alleles” (S1 Text). We observed only a significant increase in ISTR-1::GFP fluorescence when worms
were exposed worms to isp-1 feeding RNAi (Fig. 7C). Combined with the lifespan data, this points to
ISTR-1 as a key downstream mediator of PMK-3-dependent retrograde response signaling which
functions to promote longevity in worms.

DISCUSSION
In recent years it has become increasingly clear that multiple retrograde responses function to
extend life in C. elegans following mild mitochondrial ETC disruption (12). The specific mode of ETC
disruption (genetic mutation, RNAi knockdown or chemical inhibition), as well as the mitochondrial
complex targeted by that disruption, together determine the nature of the cell response and the
subsequent life-extending mechanisms that are activated. Several recent studies have shed light on some
of these life-extending processes such as activation of HIF-1 following the aberrant accumulation of
mitochondrial-derived α-ketoacids (16), changes in global gene expression following epigenetic
reprogramming of histones (35, 36), autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria (37), activation of
the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (38), stimulation of DNA damage response proteins (39), and activation
of the UBL-5 sub-branch of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (36). Several proteins with less
clear functions, including ceh-23 and taf-4 have also been implicated in longevity signaling (9, 40). The
PMK-3-dependent pathway examined in this study acts independently of all well-known life-extending
pathways in C. elegans (17) and, to our knowledge, represents a novel survival mechanism.
In the current work, we expanded our understanding of the molecular and physiological details
behind the PMK-3 retrograde response. We showed that the full-length isoform of PMK-3 is specifically
required for life extension following ETC disruption, and that restriction of this isoform to the worm
intestine is sufficient to confer complete life extension under these conditions. Our data also show that

neurons do not activate the PMK-3 retrograde response cell autonomously following feeding RNAi
targeting atp-3 or isp-1, even though these cells are fully capable of activating this pathway (17). Our
data also reveal a technical flaw in use of the rgef-1 and rab-3 neuronal promoters when expressed from
an extrachromosomal array. While both reporters clearly induce strong neuronal expression, they
nonetheless also result in mis-expression in the gut. The strong quantum yield of mCherry, as opposed to
that of GFP, made it possible for us to capture this mis-expression, and also to avoid making the
wrongful conclusion that intestinal retrograde response signaling is activated cell non-autonomously via
neuronal PMK-3 signaling. Our findings underscore the worm intestine as the most important site for
PMK-3 to activate life-promoting signals in response to ETC disruption.
Previous studies using C. elegans have implicated both intestinal and neuronal tissue in longevity
signaling following mitochondrial ETC disruption (41, 42). Notwithstanding the potential confound of
neuronal promoters leaking on in gut tissue, a model was developed whereby mitochondrial stress in
neurons causes the release of a “mitokine” that relays a signal to the intestine to upregulate the
mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and promote longevity. Although a role for the UPRmt
in longevity specification is contentious (41, 43), support for the dual tissue component of this model
was provided by two studies from the same group. Mild mitochondrial ETC disruption was shown to
induce distinct epigenetic alteration of histones in neuronal and intestinal cells, both of which were
required for life extension. The neuronal pathway utilized the histone demethylases JMJD-1.2 and
JMJD-3.1 (36), while the intestinal pathway required DVE-1, LIN-65, MET-2 and UBL-5 (35). It is
possible that the PMK-3 retrograde response examined in the current study intersects with the DVE1/LIN-65/MET-2/UBL-5 retrograde response to control longevity, since both pathways localize to the
intestine. One possibility is they act linearly. However, we find that knockdown of DVE-1 does not
prevent Ptbb-6::GFP expression, which is under the control of PMK-3. Moreover, we have previously
reported that ATFS-1, which functions downstream of DVE-1/LIN-65/MET-2/UBL-5 to turn on the
UPRmt, does not require PMK-3 (17). Another possibility is that both retrograde responses converge to

control longevity. This might explain why overexpression of a constitutively active form of DLK-1 in
the gut was unable to extend life in the absence of ETC disruption – either other factors controlled by
the DVE-1/LIN-65/MET-2/UBL-5 retrograde response needed to be present or the necessary epigenetic
reprograming of gut cells by this system was not in place. Finally, it is also possible that the PMK-3 and
DVE-1/LIN-65/MET-2/UBL-5 retrograde responses function independently of each other.
One surprising finding that arose from our current study is the apparent decline in DLK-1/PMK3 signaling capacity with age. Loss of DLK-1 signaling capacity seems to be the simplest reason why
life was not extended when constitutively active DLK-1 was overexpressed in wild type worms in the
absence of ETC dysfunction. We have excluded transcriptional downregulation as the mechanism by
which signaling is inactivated, but many potential factors remain to be tested such as increased DLK-1
turnover. Likewise, what factors or signals from dysfunctional mitochondria establish conditions that are
permissive to the continued expression of the DLK-1/PMK-3 pathway as animals age is also unclear. As
mentioned previously, epigenetic reprograming by the DVE-1/LIN-65/MET-2/UBL-5 retrograde
response is one possibility. Other possibilities relate to mitokine signaling, or downregulation of vhp-1.
Alternatively, Jeong and colleagues (44) recently identified a novel mechanism by which the p38
MAPK PMK-1 is activated in C. elegans. Studying the innate immune response of worms exposed to
pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14), they found that a cytosolically-localized form of the
mitochondrial chaperone HSP-60 physically bound to and stabilized the MAP2K SEK-1. This, in turn,
up-regulated PMK-1 activity and increased PA14 resistance. Whether a related mechanism acts to
stabilize DLK-1 or SEK-3 following mild mitochondrial ETC disruption remains to be determined.
We have additionally shown there may be a role for the endosomal trafficking pathway in
mediating ETC stress-induced life extension downstream of PMK-3. In particular, we identified the
ESCRT-III-associated proteins ISTR-1 and C01A2.4 (CHMP2B), as well as RAB-11.1 as necessary for
this longevity (45-47). The ESCRT-III machinery plays important roles in extracellular vesicle (EV)
formation. EVs can be categorized into two broad types depending on their mode of formation.

Exosomes originate late in the endocytic pathway and are formed when multivesicular bodies (MVBs)
are re-routed for fusion with the plasma membrane instead of the lysosome. Ectosomes bud directly
from the plasma membrane. In both instances, ESCRT-III proteins play a pivotal role in vesicle
formation and release, directing the final membrane scission event (48).
Recent studies have implicated extracellular vesicles in an array of functions, including the
control of mouse aging by hypothalamic stem cells (49), cardiac rejuvenation (50), and cancer
metastasis (51). Such findings raise the provocative possibility that C. elegans might use EVs to
broadcast the metabolic status of its intestinal cells to the rest of the body to control longevity. On the
other hand, these proteins might simply play a role in increased lysosomal turnover. Consistent with this
possibility, it has been reported that mitophagy is increased in worms following disruption of various
ETC targets (52, 53), and there is a well-established requirement for autophagy in promoting the
longevity of mitochondrial ETC mutants (37, 54). Furthermore, genetic screens have linked DLK-1 and
PMK-3 signaling with elevated endocytosis in neurons (28, 55), as well as increased RAB-11.1 levels
and lysosomal trafficking in muscle cells (56). Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether increased
endolysosomal trafficking or reduced extracellular vesicle formation was responsible for the phenotypes
observed in each of these prior studies.
We predict that EVs emitted from the baso-lateral surface of intestinal cells into the coelomic
cavity in response to PMK-3 activation will mediate signaling to the rest of the body to control
longevity. However, formal testing of the role of EVs in PMK-3 retrograde response signaling is
currently hampered by technical limitations which prevent isolation of EVs from specific tissues (26).
Current, state-of-the-art isolation of EVs from C. elegans is restricted to extracorporeal populations from
starved worms (26). When non-stressed worms were treated with these EV populations from worms
with activated PMK-3 signaling to see if they might mediate a broader retrograde signal, we find not
unexpectedly that they do not (Fig. S11). Biological and technical advances which permit EV signaling

their role in the PMK-3 retrograde response and other pathways.

Figure 1. Only the long isoform of PMK-3 encodes a stable protein.
(A) Schematic of pmk-3 genetic locus. mRNA splice variants are shown. Size of encoded protein
products listed on right (αα - amino acids). Genomic DNA deleted in pmk-3(tm745) shown with red bar.
Location of amino acids altered by point mutation in this study are colored red. Exons encoding relevant
protein domains are boxed. Position of the GFP fusion junction in the PMK-3 translational reporters of
strains DA1750 and GJ3080 are marked (long arrows).
(B) Western analysis of pmk-3(tm745) worms containing the long (L) or short (S) recombinant PMK-3
isoforms under control of the ubiquitously-expressed eft-3 promoter. All lanes contain equal amounts of
whole-worm lysate (1% SDS). Arrow marks PMK-3(L). Parent blot shown in Fig. S4.
(C) (Left panel) Homology model of PMK-3 (αα 110-459) (white) based on crystal structure of human
p38α (PDB: 1R3C) (cyan). TQY of the PMK-3 activation loop is shown (magenta), along with the
predicted position of SB220025 inhibitor binding (red) marking the ATP-binding pocket. A structurebased alignment of both proteins is provided in Fig. S5. (Right panel) PMK-3(S) lacks the first 174 αα
of PMK-3(L) (residues highlighted in orange), constituting half of the C-terminal core domain and
including key ATP-stabilizing residues such as LYS150 (green) conserved in other MAPKs. TQY of the
PMK-activation loop is shown (magenta), along with the location of the C-terminal peptide epitope used
for production of PMK-3 antisera (dotted surface). Disruption of the predicted ATP binding site of
PMK-3(L), marked by SB220025 (red), is evident. Image rotated 90° relative to left panel.
(D) Space-filling model of PMK-3(L) showing asymmetry of non-conserved residues (red) relative to
both PMK-1 and PMK-2. (Additional coloring: white: Cα carbon; cyan: identical residue, green:
conservative alteration: yellow: SB220025 , magenta: TQY).

Figure 2. Effect of transgenic PMK-3(L) overexpression on retrograde response activation.
(A-C) Intestinal expression of Ptbb-6::GFP following mitochondrial ETC disruption by atp-3 or isp-1
feeding RNAi is restored in pmk-3(tm745) mutants expressing ubiquitous (eft-3 promoter), gut-specific
(vha-6 promoter) or neuronal (rgef-1 promoter) PMK-3(L), as marked by mCherry expression. No
transgenic construct activates Ptbb-6::GFP in the absence of ETC disruption (vector-only treatment,
Vec.). Worms that have lost their respective transgenic array [right columns in (A) and (B), and worms
marked with an asterisk in (C)] are included for comparison. Scale bars in (A) and (B): 200 μm, and in
(C) 250 μm. Arrow in (C) marks worm that is magnified (4X) in panel (D).
(D) Higher resolution imaging reveals activation of Ptbb-6::GFP in the gut of worms expressing PMK3(L) under the rgef-1 promoter is due to reporter mis-expression and not cell non-autonomous signaling
from neurons to gut cells (arrow). Additional worm images are provided in Fig. S6.
(E, F) Higher magnification images of transgene-containing worms in (A) and (B) cultured on1/10th
strength atp-3 or isp-1 RNAi.
For each listed strain, only relevant genotype information is provided (see Table S1 for full details). In
all images, mCherry expression indicates presence of the relevant extrachromosomal array and
production of transgenic PMK-3.

Figure 3. Life extension induced by isp-1 feeding RNAi is fully restored by intestinal PMK-3 reexpression in pmk-3(tm745) mutants. Two different doses of isp-1 bacterial feeding RNAi were tested
- 1/10th strength (left panels) and ½ strength (right panels). Survival statistics for all panels is provided
in Table S2.
(A) Wild type worms (strain SLR115) exhibit a dose dependent increase in life span when fed RNAi
targeting isp-1. This response is abolished in pmk-3(tm745) knock-out mutants.

(B) Ubiquitous re-expression of PMK-3(L) in pmk-3(tm745) null mutants restores the longevity
response invoked by isp-1 feeding RNAi (strain SLR0155).
(C) Full life extension is also restored to pmk-3(tm745) mutants when PMK-3(L) re-expression is
restricted to the gut (strain SLR0153).
In B and C worms that have lost the array (-) serve as controls for potential strain background effects.
Full genotype information for each strain is provided in Table S1.

Figure 4. Constitutive activation of DLK-1 in the intestine is sufficient to drive activation of stress
signaling.
(A) Schematic showing dlk-1 and mutant pmk-3 transgene generation. Constructs are comprised of a
two-gene operon assembled as follows: (left to right) promoter (Pvha-6 or Peft-3), dlk-1 or pmk-3
cDNA, splice leader sequence (SL2), mCherry reporter, unc-54 3’UTR. Strain names of worms carrying
the relevant transgene are indicated, along with a summary of the effect of each transgene on Ptbb6::GFP reporter expression under the listed conditions (see main text for details).
(B) Wild type worms expressing DLK-1b(EE) exhibit constitutive activation of the PMK-3 dependent
reporter gene, Ptbb-6::GFP, independent of mitochondrial ETC disruption (compare animals cultured on
bacteria containing vector control (vec.) and atp-3 or isp-1 feeding RNAi. Worms that have lost their
array (-) are included for comparison. Scale bar: 200 μm.
(C) Expression of DLK-1b(EE), a constitutively active form of DLK-1, in the gut of wild type worms is
by itself insufficient to extend life. Moreover, exposure of these animals to isp-1 feeding RNAi (1/10th
strength (upper panel) and ½ strength (lower panel), does not extend life beyond that observed for wild
type animals exposed to the same conditions (compare to Figs. 3A left and right panels, respectively).

(A-C) By two weeks of age, constitutive Ptbb-6::GFP reporter expression is lost in wild type worms
containing the DLK-1b(EE) transgenic array (strain SLR0152), even though the promoter driving DLK1 is still transcribed [compare mCherry signal to GFP signal in (A) and (B)]. By contrast, in SLR0152
worms that have been exposed to isp-1 feeding RNAi (1/10th strength) throughout their life, Ptbb-6::GFP
reporter expression remains robustly activated at two weeks of age. An enlargement of the fluorescent
images in (B) is shown in panel C [specific areas are marked in the left two DIC images of panel B
(dotted boxes)]. Worms that have lost their array (-) in (A) and (B) are included for comparison. All
scale bars: 500 μm.
(D, E) SLR0164 worms contain two independent arrays expressing DLK-1b(EE) and PMK-3(L),
respectively. Both transgenes are controlled by the gut-specific vha-6 promoter. In (D), upper left panel
illustrates SLR0164 worms that have lost both arrays (#1), worms with both arrays (#2, 4), and worms
with only the DLK-1b(EE) array (#3). Even though PMK-3(L) is constitutively expressed by the vha-6
promoter, and activated by DLK-1b(EE) early in life in worms containing both arrays, as marked by
Ptbb-6::GFP expression, the reporter gene is gradually dampened with age until it is off completely by
day 16. Accordingly, SLR0164 worms exhibit no life extension (E). Survival data for two independent
lines is shown. Siblings lacking both extrachromosomal arrays are included as controls. Survival
statistics are provided in Table S2. Scale bar in (D): 200 μm.

(D) Affymetrix mRNA expression analysis of wild type (WT) worms and atfs-1(tm4525) mutants
exposed to spg-7 feeding RNAi (58). Bars illustrate mean (+/- SD) of three independent biological
replicates for each tested condition. All data was normalized to wild type worms on vector control for
each listed gene. (Student’s t-test, * q-value <0.05, # q-value <0.07).

Figure 7. ESCRT Proteins Play an Essential Role in the PMK-3 Retrograde Response.
(A) Survival analyses of wild type worms (SLR115) exposed to dual feeding RNAi targeting isp-1
(1/10th strength) and the listed ESCRT gene (9/10th strength). Data was pooled from two independent
experiments (N = 95 - 180 worms per tested condition). (istr-1+isp-1 vs. vector) and (rab-11.1+isp-1 vs.
vector), Bonferroni corrected p-values 0.0; (C01A2.4+isp-1 vs. isp-1), Bonferroni corrected p-value
<0.04.
(B) qRT-PCR analysis of ESCRT genes in wild type worms (SLR115) and pmk-3(tm745) knockout
mutants (SLR0150) following growth on 1/10th strength- or undiluted isp-1 feeding RNAi from the time
of hatching until the first day of adulthood. pmk-3 and tbb-6 genes were included as controls. Bars
illustrate mean (+/- SEM) from seven independent biological replicates. Data was normalized to the wild
type vector control for each listed gene. (Student’s one-tailed t-test, * p-value <0.05, ** p-value <0.01.)
(C) ‘Third allele’ versions of ALX-1, CO1A2.4 and ISTR-1 encoding C-terminal GFP fusion proteins
were generated in HT1593 [unc-119(ed3)] worms by microinjection. Extrachromosomal arrays also
contained a rescuing UNC-119 marker gene. Each strain was cultured on isp-1 feeding RNAi and GFP
fluorescence recorded at the first day of adulthood. Data is presented relative to control (vector-only)
treated animals. (N = 18-24 worms per condition; mean +/- SEM).
