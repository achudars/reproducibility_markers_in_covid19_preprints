Abstract

19

Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) is the causative agent of pertussis (whooping cough).

20

Since the 1990s, pertussis has re-emerged in the United States despite an estimated

21

95% vaccine coverage. Our goal was to characterize neutrophil responses and gene

22

expression profiles of murine lungs in the context of vaccination and B. pertussis

23

challenge. We utilized a bioluminescent neutrophil mouse model (NECre luc) to track

24

neutrophil recruitment. NECre luc mice were immunized with whole cell vaccine (WCV),

25

acellular vaccine (ACV), or a truncated adenylate cyclase toxoid (RTX) vaccine.

26

Neutrophil recruitment was measured in live mice across time and corroborated by flow

27

cytometry and other data. WCV immunized mice showed signs of neutrophilia in response

28

to B. pertussis challenge. Mice immunized with either ACV or WCV cleared the challenge

29

infection; however immunization with RTX alone was not protective. RNA sequencing

30

revealed distinctive gene expression profiles for each immunization group. We observed

31

an increase in expression of genes associated with responses to infection, and changes

32

in expression of distinct genes in each vaccine group, providing a complex view of the

33

immune response to B. pertussis infection in mice. This study suggests that combination

34

of immunological analysis with transcriptomic profiling can facilitate discovery of pre-

35

clinical correlates of protection for vaccine development.

Introduction

42

Pertussis is a human disease primarily caused by a respiratory infection of the Gram-

43

negative pathogen Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis). The hallmark of pertussis is a distinctive

44

whooping cough. What is surprising about pertussis is that the cause of the cough has never been

45

elucidated, which highlights the fact that there are many under-researched aspects of this

46

disease.

47

epithelial cells through bacterial adhesins such as filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), fimbriae and

48

pertactin1. After colonization B. pertussis express multiple toxins including pertussis toxin (PT)

49

and adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT). B. pertussis releases PT, which dysregulates the immune

50

response through ADP-ribosylation of the G-protein α-subunit of cytokine receptors present on a

51

range of leukocytes2–5 . The secretion of PT has long range effects, ACT is thought to act locally

52

on host cells by converting ATP into supraphysiological levels of cAMP, further dysregulating the

53

host immune response6.

54

In the 1940s, an effective whole cell vaccine (WCV) was developed and as a result, basic research

55

efforts on B. pertussis decreased. The WCVs were highly reactogenic and caused prolonged and

56

unusual crying after administration, hyporesponsivness, and febrile convulsions 7–9. These issues

57

led to the development of acellular vaccines (ACV), known today as DTaP/Tdap (hereafter

58

referred to as ACV). The ACVs utilize an alum adjuvant and induce a Th2 response to several

59

key virulence factors such as PT, FHA, fimbriae, and pertactin depending on vaccine formulations.

60

Whereas the ACV induces a Th2 response in human and mice, WCV immunization and B.

61

pertussis infection promote a Th1/Th17-type response10–14. Since the replacement of the WCV

62

with the ACVs there has been a remarkable increase in the number of cases in the US, with the

63

number of reported cases in 2012 equaling that of 1954. Multiple factors potentially played a role

64

in the return of pertussis in the US. It has been documented that the Th2 response induced by

65

ACV immunization may be inferior to the Th1/Th17 response directed by the WCV15. Additionally,

Aerosolized B. pertussis bacterium are inhaled and adhere to airway respiratory

66

ACV protection wanes significantly as early as one year after vaccination, and by 4 years after

67

vaccination vaccine effectiveness is only 9%16. Furthermore, in a non-human primate model it has

68

been shown that ACV immunized baboons challenged with B. pertussis are capable of carrying

69

the infection and transmitting aerosolized B. pertussis to naïve baboons17. Additionally, the

70

findings of an epidemiological study suggest that asymptomatic transmission of pertussis is

71

indeed occurring in the human population, and has a role in the increase of pertussis incidents18.

72

These recent findings demonstrate the shortcomings of the ACV. Utilizing new technologies that

73

were not available during the developments of the WCV or ACVs we can further investigate

74

differences between WCV and ACV protection. Adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) is an essential

75

virulence factor of B. pertussis and a known protective antigen19–21. ACT contains two main

76

domains: adenylate cyclase and the Repeats-in-Toxin (RTX). In the absence of the AC domain,

77

the protein is non-toxic and referred to simply as RTX22. In a previous study, sera from mice

78

immunized with RTX contained antibodies capable of neutralizing ACT. ACT antigens are not

79

included in any commercial formulations of ACVs and many have proposed that its inclusion could

80

improve protection6.

81

Neutrophils play a role in both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.

82

Following B. pertussis infection of a naïve mouse, neutrophils reach peak recruitment between 5

83

and 7 days after challenge23,24. This occurs after the bacterial burden has begun to decrease.

84

Subsequent studies have determined that neutrophil depletion prior to B. pertussis infection in

85

naïve mice does not increase bacterial burden. However, when immunized mice are challenged

86

with B. pertussis following depletion of neutrophils the B. pertussis bacterial burden increase,

87

demonstrating a protective role of neutrophils in immunized mice25. As previously mentioned, B.

88

pertussis toxins PT and ACT both affect neutrophils and their recruitment6,26–28. These toxins

89

contribute to a significant rise in the number of circulating white blood cells and in severe cases

90

leukocytosis is linked to fatality1. Leukocytosis was first described in pertussis patients as early

91

as the 1890s29,30. In the 1960’s, Stephen Morse observed leukocytosis following WCV

92

immunization31, which he hypothesized was caused by PT, then known as leukocytosis-inducing

93

factor32. Therefore, it can be conceived that the toxin associated effects on neutrophils would be

94

neutralized following ideal B. pertussis immunization, and this raises the question of where and

95

when neutrophils are recruited in an ACV or WCV protected mouse?

96

In this study, we utilized in vivo imaging systems (IVIS) to characterize the neutrophil

97

responses to B. pertussis challenge in mice vaccinated with ACV or WCV. We implemented

98

NECre luc mice, a luminescent neutrophil reporter mouse strain, previously used in a Bacillus

99

anthracis infection model to track neutrophil recruitment following B. pertussis challenge33. To do

100

so, we: 1) validated the NECre luc mouse as a model for tracking neutrophil recruitment in

101

response to B. pertussis infection, 2) tracked the spatiotemporal localization of neutrophils in

102

response to B. pertussis challenge in ACV and WCV vaccinated mice, and 3) and characterized

103

vaccine-associated gene expression profiles of the infected lungs from each group using RNA

104

sequencing. The NeCRE luc mouse33 was used to measure the presence and relative quantities

105

of neutrophils in live mice during B. pertussis challenge. We then corroborated our findings with

106

flow cytometry analysis to quantify neutrophils in the blood and airway of naïve and immunized

107

mice. WCV immunization resulted in robust neutrophil recruitment and clearance of B. pertussis,

108

but also resulted in morbidity of the NeCre luc mice. RNAseq analysis was performed on the

109

lungs of naïve or immunized mice at both early and late time-points after challenge with B.

110

pertussis. We observed specific gene signatures for each vaccine, and we also identified gene

111

expression profiles that had not been associated with B. pertussis or immunization. Neutrophil

112

specific gene expression corroborated our cellular analysis of the respiratory tract demonstrating

113

increased expression of neutrophil specific genes in WCV immunized mice. Furthermore, we

114

determined the T-helper cell gene expression profiles of lung transcriptomes and corroborated

115

the activation of Th1 specific gene expression to increased levels of Th1-associated cytokine

116

production in the lungs of WCV immunized mice. Utilizing the depth of data generated through

117

RNAseq, we could classify specific B cell clonotypes present in the lung of each immunization

group. This technique allowed for analysis of the diversity and frequency of the immunoglobulin

119

repertoire of immunized groups. We hypothesize that these approaches can continue to be

120

applied to other pathogen to host interactions to characterize the underpinnings to disease

121

progression and immunological responses.

122

Results

123

ACV and WCV immunization of NECre luc mice results in clearance of B. pertussis,

124

however WCV immunized mice experience increased morbidity and mortality.

125

To characterize the effects of vaccination on neutrophil recruitment, NECre luc mice were

126

immunized with the vaccines as indicated in Supplementary Table S1, and then boosted with the

127

same vaccine 21 days later by intraperitoneal injection. We then compared the neutrophil

128

recruitment in naïve, ACV, WCV, and RTX-only vaccinated NECre luc mice during B. pertussis

129

challenge. At day 35 post initial immunization, NECre luc mic were challenged with virulent B.

131

pertussis does not typically cause morbidity in immunocompetent mice such as CD-1 or C57B6/J

132

(data not shown). We originally planned to euthanize 4 mice per group on each experimental day

133

(1, 2, 4, and 9). However, 2 of 13 naïve challenged NECre luc mice were euthanized at day 2 due

134

to morbidity (Fig. 2). At day 6, we observed additional unexpectedly morbidity in the WCV group,

135

which required euthanasia of all remaining WCV immunized NECre luc mice (Fig. 2). Conversely,

136

no morbidity was observed in the ACV and RTX immunized mice 9 days post B. pertussis

137

challenge (Fig. 2). We were surprised to observe morbidity in the WCV immunized mice. Upon

138

determining viable bacterial burden from lung, trachea, and nasal lavage, we observed clearance

139

of B. pertussis to our limits of detection in both ACV and WCV immunized mice compared to naïve

140

infection (Fig. 3abc). Taken together, these data suggested that morbidity of the WCV immunized

141

mice was not fully attributed to bacterial burden. Additionally, we determined that vaccination with

142

RTX resulted in 100 percent survival out to 9 days post-challenge (pc), while bacterial burden

143

were similar to naïve infected mice, suggesting that RTX immunization did not improve bacterial

144

clearance (Fig. 3abc).

145

Analysis of serological responses of immunized mice.

146

As expected, the ACV immunized mice were protected against challenge as they rapidly

147

cleared the B. pertussis challenge dose (Fig. 3abc). WCV immunized mice cleared B. pertussis,

148

but this response was delayed compared to the ACV mice. To determine the efficacy of

149

immunization on antibody production, we performed serology analysis. PT is a common antigen

150

of both the ACV and WCV and we observed a significantly higher concentration of anti-PT in the

151

ACV mice compared to the WCV (Fig. 3d). Immunization of NECre mice with RTX with alum

152

adjuvant resulted in high anti-RTX antibody titers (Fig. 3e) despite the fact that we did not see

153

increased clearance due to RTX immunization. In another study, we immunized CD1 mice with

154

RTX and alum adjuvant and we also saw no clearance of B. pertussis compared to non-

155

vaccinated mice (data not shown). Our data suggest that, while immunization with RTX induces

156

antibody production, it is not sufficient to protect mice from B. pertussis infection as a single,

157

antigen vaccine.

158

Spatiotemporal IVIS imaging of neutrophils in naïve and vaccinated NECre luc mice.

159

Neutrophil accumulation in NECre luc mice were visualized on days 1, 2, 4, 6 and 9 post-

160

challenge. Mice were IP injected with the high sensitivity luciferin CycLuc133 before imaging. A

161

Lumina II IVIS (Xenogen) was used to capture luciferase-driven neutrophil luminescence at

162

indicated time-points (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Luminescent signal of the whole body

163

(Fig. 4d) or nasal cavity (Fig. 4e) of vaccinated mice was then compared to signal from naïve,

164

non-infected mice and calculated as fold change. At day 1 post-challenge, we detected

165

significantly higher luminescence in naïve challenged mice compared to naïve non-challenged

166

mice, suggesting that there is a higher neutrophil accumulation in challenged mice. Furthermore,

167

whole body luminescence in WCV immunized and challenged mice was significantly higher than

168

the whole body luminescence of naïve, ACV and RTX B. pertussis challenged mice at day 1 (Fig.

169

4d). In general, luminescence signals of all groups decreased across days 2 and 4. However, in

170

the WCV group at day 6, we detected an increase in signal in the nasal cavity (71-fold) and the

171

whole body (47-fold) compared to naïve not challenged mice (Fig. 4de). Due to variability between

172

animals, this increase was not significant compared to other groups. At this point WCV immunized

173

mice were morbid and required euthanasia. Taken together this data suggests that WCV

174

immunization prior to challenge resulted in increased neutrophil accumulation compared to other

175

vaccination groups. We next aimed to corroborate our IVIS luminescence data with flow cytometry

176

analysis of respiratory tissues.

177

Validation of neutrophil infiltration in respiratory tissue by flow cytometry

178

Luminescent signal of luciferase-expressing cells correlates with the localization of

179

neutrophils in NECre luc mice33. To confirm this, we measured the relative number of neutrophils

180

by performing flow cytometry analysis on respiratory tissue following IVIS imaging. Single cell

181

suspensions from lung tissue or nasal lavage were labelled with antibodies recognizing cell

182

surface markers. We defined neutrophils as CD11b+GR-1+ live cells (Supplementary Fig. 2).

183

Similar to the IVIS data, all B. pertussis challenged groups had significantly higher neutrophil

184

percentages in nasal lavage compared to naïve non-challenged mice (Fig. 4f). At day 1 post B.

185

pertussis challenge, WCV immunized mice had a significantly higher percentage of neutrophils

186

than ACV immunized mice in nasal lavage. The percentages of neutrophils decreased from day

187

1 to day 2 in all vaccinated groups, as well as the naïve group. At day 4, WCV immunized mice

188

exhibited higher levels of neutrophils than those observed at day 2 (Fig. 4g). Correlating with the

189

nasal lavage, WCV mice exhibited significantly higher percentages of neutrophils in the lungs

190

than ACV mice. Lung neutrophils at day 4 were not statistically significant between any of the

191

groups. However, by day 6 there was a 53% increase in lung neutrophils compared to day 4 in

the WCV group, which directly correlates with the increased luminescence signals measured by

193

IVIS imaging (Fig. 4g).

194

WCV immunized NECre luc mice induce a more robust Th1 immune response compared

195

to ACV immunized mice.

196

It has been previously documented that upon B. pertussis challenge, WCV immunized

197

mice elicit a Th1/Th17 immune response, similar to a naïve infection while ACV immunized mice

198

generate primarily a Th2 response10–12,34. We hypothesized that similar responses are triggered

199

by WCV and ACV in the NECre luc model. To test this hypothesis, we determined the cytokine

200

profiles in lungs of immunized and challenged mice using electrochemiluminescent sandwich

201

immunoassays. The Th1 response was determined by increased levels of IFN-γ, IL-12p70, IL-1β

202

and TNF-α (Fig. 5ab), while the Th17 response was qualified by increased IL-17A and IL-6 (Fig.

203

5cde). Th2 responses were associated to increased levels in IL-4 and IL-5.

204

As expected, we observed an increased Th1 response in the WCV vaccinated NECre luc

205

mice compared to the ACV group. We also observed an increase in the Th1 response in naive

206

challenged mice compared to non-challenged mice or the ACV group. Interestingly, the highest

207

levels of IL-17 were observed in WCV NECre luc mice (Fig. 5c). The levels of Th2-associated

208

cytokines, IL-4 and IL5 were similar between the WCV and ACV groups. (Supplementary Fig. 3).

209

The lung cytokine profile from NECre luc mice immunized with RTX resembled a profile of naïve

210

B. pertussis challenged mice with the exception of IL-6, which was lower in the RTX group. Taken

211

together these data from the NECre luc mouse model corroborates previous findings by displaying

212

a strong Th1/Th17 response in response to B. pertussis in WCV vaccinated mice.

215

Current and past B. pertussis immune response studies have focused on a limited set of

216

known immunological responses to B. pertussis challenge such as: bacterial burden, antibody

217

response, recruitment of phagocytes, cytokine profiles, and others

218

toxin-mediated disease, due mainly to the activity of pertussis and adenylate cyclase toxins.

219

These toxins are released and affect a wide array of host cells4,25. It is therefore conceivable that

220

B. pertussis infection would have a broader effect on the respiratory tissue beyond the induction

221

of predictable immune response factors. To address this, we employed RNA sequencing

222

(RNAseq) to observe the effect of B. pertussis challenge on the lungs of immunized and naïve

223

NECre luc mice at a transcriptomic level. This allowed us to characterize the transcriptome

224

response to infection and vaccine-induced responses. We hypothesized that regardless of the

225

vaccine administered, we would identify a set of genes differentially regulated in all challenged

226

mice. Additionally, we sought to discern the unique gene expression profiles in response to

227

challenge in each immunized group.

228

To perform RNAseq analysis, lungs from NECre luc mice were harvested at an early time-

229

point (day 1) following B. pertussis challenge and at a late time-point (day 6 or 9). RNA from the

230

lungs of the mice was isolated. Libraries were prepared and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq

231

1500 platform. To characterize transcriptional responses to B. pertussis challenge in naïve or

232

vaccine mice (ACV, WCV, RTX), we compared the challenged samples to control mice that were

233

not immunized nor challenged. Based on this, we expected to determine both the immunological

234

(innate and adaptive) and the non-immunological responses to B. pertussis challenge. We

235

determined the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for both early (day 1) and late (day 6 or 9

236

depending on group) time-points. The total numbers of differentially regulated genes are shown

237

in Fig. 6ac. Overall, there were more differentially genes at the later time-point than early after

238

challenge (Fig. 6ac). At day 1 post-challenge, the WCV group had the most genes activated (Fig.

239

6a, Supplementary Fig. 5). Of the genes that were upregulated at day 1 in the WCV, 29.7% were

240

not found upregulated in the other groups (464 of 1,560). At the late time-points, there were more

241

common upregulated genes and only 14.1% of the genes were unique to the WCV. We found

242

that 12.6% of unique upregulated genes (196) were common to all groups either challenged with

243

B. pertussis following immunization or naïve challenge, suggesting that these genes were

244

common to infection (Fig. 6b). At the later time-point, 19.8% of unique upregulated genes (867 of

245

6,595) were shared by the WCV, ACV, RTX groups, while this number was much lower at the

246

early time point (8.5% of DEGs, 133 of 1,560) (Fig. 6bd). Cumulatively, this data suggests that:

247

1) WCV vaccination induces a more diverse early response to B. pertussis challenge due to the

248

higher number of unique genes compared to other groups, and 2) at the later time-point all

249

vaccinated groups have a more similar lung transcriptome.

250

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was performed to determine enrichment analyses of

251

gene expression signatures in the context of each immunization. Using IPA Knowledge-based

252

enrichment analysis, statistically significant genes were grouped into disease and function

253

categories. A system of genes was considered enriched based on Fisher’s exact test on the ratio

254

of represented genes. At the early time-point we, observed that the largest changes were

255

associated with genes involved in immune cell trafficking of the WCV group (Fig 7a). Genes with

256

the highest fold changes within this system were associated with activation and migration of

257

leukocytes (Fig. 7b). Additionally, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with

258

the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (Fig. 7b). Pertussis toxin affects multiple

259

aspects of the cardiovascular system such as blood pressure, leukocyte migration, etc7,37,38. In

both naïve and immunized mice, we observed gene expression signatures related to

cardiovascular diseases (Fig. 7ab).

mice, suggesting positive effects of anti-PT antibodies on neutralization of toxin activity. At the

RTX groups; however, the expression of these genes was still high in the WCV group. As

266

expected, immune-related gene signatures dominated the responses to B. pertussis infection.

267

However, thousands of genes significantly dysregulated due to infection at both time-points were

268

not related to immune response or were not sufficiently characterized to be assigned a function.

269

Analysis of the lung transcriptomes corroborated the findings of flow cytometry and cytokine

270

profile analyses, further supporting that there is an increase in leukocyte activity in the respiratory

271

tissue of WCV immunized mice compared to ACV or RTX immunized mice following B. pertussis

272

challenge.

273

Analysis of neutrophil-specific gene signatures

274

Since we observed that neutrophils accumulate in the lung of WCV immunized NECre luc

275

mice, we chose to delve further into the changes in expression of genes associated with neutrophil

276

activity. To compare the neutrophil response between the groups, we selected genes with GO

277

terms associated with neutrophil migration and activation and plotted the relative fold changes for

278

this subset of genes for each immunization group (Fig. 8). The expression levels of these genes

279

from either the naïve challenged, or immunized and challenged groups was compared to naïve,

280

not infected control mice (Fig. 8).

281

Cxcl2 is a chemokine produced by monocytes and neutrophils at sites of infection39.

282

Previously it has been shown that convalescent mice previously challenged with B. pertussis

283

express lower amounts of cxcl2 when re-challenged with B. pertussis than naïve mice40. This

284

suggests that the adaptive responses in these mice negate the need for the innate production of

285

Cxcl2. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed the highest expression levels of Cxcl2 in naïve

286

and RTX immunized mice, which had similar bacterial burdens (Fig. 7bd and Fig. 8be). The

287

induction of Cxcl2 expression was lower in ACV vaccinated mice than naïve mice (Fig. 8ac). The

288

expression of Cxcl2 also increased in the WCV mice, but remained high at the late time-point

289

(Fig. 8b). Our serological analysis indicated that WCV immunization only induced minimal anti-

290

PT production, whereas ACV induced high amounts of anti-PT (Fig. 3d). PT has been shown to

291

induce production of Cxcl2 in TY10 cerebral endothelial cells which further suggests a causal

292

relationship between non-neutralized PT and Cxcl2 production41.

293

All of the groups showed increases in a number of other C-X-C and C-C family chemokines

294

(cxcl3, cxcl1, ccl3, ccl4, ccl6, and ccl17). Cxcl1 gene expression was increased at day 1 in all

295

groups compared to the non-infected control (Fig. 8). We also observed an increase in IL-23

296

expression in the WCV group (Fig. 7b), which might be associated with the IL-17 cytokine

297

response measured in the WCV lung tissue. Tumor necrosis factor (tnf) gene expression was

298

increased in WCV, RTX, and ACV mice compared to non-infected mice. However, Tnf expression

299

levels decreased in ACV mice and were lower than those observed in uninfected mice at day 9

300

(Supplementary Fig. 4). Ross et al. demonstrated that IL-17A promotes production of CXCL1

301

during B. pertussis challenge10. In our cytokine analysis, only the WCV mice had sufficient IL-17

302

to be detected in the lung homogenates (Fig. 5c). Taken together these data suggest that although

303

we did not observe high IL-17A gene expression in the transcriptome or in the IL-17 cytokine

304

analysis, there could still be sufficient IL-17A in the Naïve, ACV, and RTX challenged mice that

305

could account for the increased Cxcl1 gene expression.

306

We observed that S100a9 and S100a8 were highly upregulated in WCV and RTX groups

307

(Fig. 7 and Fig. 8b). S100a9 is a major calcium-binding protein of neutrophils, which forms a

308

heterodimer with S100a8, and promotes polymerization of microtubules. Interestingly, S100a8/a9

309

is produced mainly by neutrophils and high plasma levels of S100a8/a9 correlate with higher

310

blood neutrophil blood levels in heathy human adults42. S100a8/a9 promotes transendothial

311

phagocyte migration by promoting tubulin polymerization43. Additionally, monocytes isolated from

312

human patients with cardiac injury have been found to be particularly responsive to S100a8/a9

313

and secrete increased amounts of TNF- and IL-644.

S100a8/a9 can induce neutrophil

314

chemotaxis and adherence, but PT can block this function of S100a8/a945. These data suggest

315

that PT induction of leukocytosis may be related to the role of S100a8/a9 in leukocyte recruitment.

316

S100a8/a9 expression was lowest in the ACV mice which had the highest amount of serum anti-

317

PT.

318

Overall the WCV mice had higher expression of more neutrophil genes than any of the

319

other groups (Fig. 7). Expression of these neutrophil signatures did not return to uninfected levels.

320

These observations corroborates IVIS (Fig. 4de) and flow cytometry analyses (Fig. 4fg).

321

Neutrophil gene expression in ACV mice was dynamic and returned to levels lower than

322

uninfected mice by day 9. ACV mice did not have detectable B. pertussis in their lungs at day 9,

323

indicating that the initial challenge does had been cleared (Fig. 3). ACV and WCV signatures

324

were the most dissimilar, while the RTX and naïve mice transcriptome profiles were the most

325

similar (Fig. 7). This correlates with the fact that RTX mice still have detectable B. pertussis in

326

their nares, trachea and lungs at day 9 at levels similar to those observed in non-vaccinated mice.

327

These data confirm our neutrophil observations but also enhance our analysis of the neutrophil

328

dynamic in the context of vaccination status and B. pertussis challenge.

329

B cell gene expression signatures in relation to immunization status.

330

It has been established that B cells are required for the clearance of B. pertussis in mice

331

and that ACV immunization protects through neutralizing antibodies46,47. To further investigate

332

antibody production between WCV and ACV immunized mice, we aimed to determine the

333

diversity of B cell clone expansion between vaccinated and non-vaccinated challenged mice.

334

Using MiXCR software, the same illumina sequenced reads mentioned above were analyzed

335

specifically for immunoglobulin profiling48. Individual B cell clones were identified by B cell

336

receptor sequence and clonal expansion was accessed by immunoglobulin diversity and

337

frequency between the vaccinated and challenged, naïve challenged, and non-challenged control

338

groups. At the early time-point day 1 post-challenge, immunoglobulin diversity and frequency of

339

B cells depicted a close relation between the ACV and RTX vaccination groups, as also did WCV

340

and naïve challenged mice (Supplementary Fig. 6a). This response shifted by the late time-point

341

(days 6 or 9), when we observed that WCV and ACV groups were more similar. Using this

342

approach, we were able to determine the individual variable and joining segments abundance,

343

and the frequency of which a particular was found. Not surprisingly, we observed the highest

344

degree of diversity at the late time-point. WCV and ACV were the most similar due to a higher

345

number and abundance of clonotypes (Supplementary Fig. 6b). We focused our analysis on the

346

diversity of the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) of the heavy Ig chain, because

347

this region has been shown to be necessary for antigen specificity49. The highest abundant CDR3

348

region sequence, NQHLFW, was present only in the WCV immunized mice, while the other 10

349

highest CDR3 regions were shared across vaccine groups at the early and late time-points

350

(Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Table 7). Together this data suggests that clones

351

generated from acellular based vaccines (ACT and RTX) are more closely related because they

352

are generated to a limited number of antigens. However, by the late time-point, proliferation of

353

specific B cell clones generated from WCV has created the same diversity seen in the ACV

354

clones. The B cell clonotype analysis suggests that we can aim to further understand these

355

populations in the future but we will need to increase our sequencing depth by directly isolating

356

the cell populations from the immunized mice instead of analyzing the full lung tissue. It may also

357

be interesting to probe the T cell receptor clonotypes using the same method.

358

Discussion

359

In this study, we compared the innate and adaptive immune responses of immunized

360

NECre luc mice vaccinated with ACV or WCV vaccines, to mice immunized with a truncated ACT

361

toxin absorbed to alum (RTX), or non-vaccinated naïve mice following challenge with B. pertussis.

362

ACV and WCV immunized mice cleared B. pertussis challenge but distinctive immune responses

363

were observed. We also determined that the RTX antigen alone was not protective as a single

364

antigen vaccine with alum adjuvant in NeCre luc mice. We utilized IVIS imaging to track the

365

recruitment of neutrophils to the respiratory tract of challenged mice from days 1 to 9 post-

366

challenge. The data obtained illustrated a dramatic increase in the amount of neutrophils recruited

367

to the lungs and nasal cavity of WCV immunized mice compared to ACV immunized mice when

368

followed by B. pertussis challenge. These data were also supported by flow cytometry and

369

cytokine analysis. Furthermore, by performing RNA sequencing on the lung transcriptome during

370

infection in vaccinated or naïve mice, we described unique gene expression profiles depending

371

on the vaccination status of the mice. We also used RNA sequencing to begin to describe the

372

immunoglobulin diversity induced by each vaccine.

373

Upon initial B. pertussis challenge, we observed activation of neutrophil associated genes in all

374

groups, however it was only in the WCV immunized mice that we saw increased neutrophil genes

375

expression still elevated at the late time-point. Neutrophilia and elevated neutrophil related genes

376

expression at the late time-point, when bacterial numbers in the airways are greatly reduced,

377

indicates either over activation of neutrophil “chemokine storm,” or possibly a lack of neutralization

378

of bacterial toxins. Multiple studies suggest that PT is responsible for neutrophilia and

379

leukocytosis following B. pertussis infection13,32,50,51. Immunization with the ACV induced 1,146-

380

fold more anti-PT antibody production than WCV immunization at day 2 (Fig. 3d). It is possible

381

that the low levels of anti-PT production in WCV mice resulted in insufficient neutralization of PT,

382

resulting in exacerbated neutrophilia. Surprisingly, the highest neutrophil accumulation was

383

determined at day 6 post-challenge when bacterial levels were similar to those of ACV protected

384

mice (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that while WCV immunization is protective at clearing

385

infection in NECre luc mice, it also induced severe neutrophilia. Interestingly, the neutrophil

386

response in WCV mice decreased at days 2 and 4 but highly increased at day 6 (Fig. 4). At day

387

2, we observed a significant increase in IL-17 in the lungs of WCV mice (Fig. 5c) that could result

388

from the increased IL-17 expression in these mice.

Stephen Morse observed dose-dependent

389

leukocytosis in mice following vaccination with killed B. pertussis31. In this study, NECre luc mice

390

were immunized with 1/5th the human dose of WCV. We now realize that this dose is likely well

391

above the proportional weight of a mouse compared to a human. It is possible that this high

392

vaccine dose induced the hyper leukocytosis, similar to the dose-dependent increase that Morse

393

observed. It is known that hyperleukocytosis is associated with death in infant cases, and that PT

394

is responsible for inducing leukocytosis1,7,52. Furthermore, mice and baboons infected with B.

395

pertussis and then treated with anti-PT antibodies had lower levels of leukocytosis compared to

396

non-infected controls50. An epidemiological study found that in unvaccinated individuals with

397

pertussis, 72% of patients experienced leukocytosis53. In this study, we observed that WCV

398

immunized NECre luc mice experienced neutrophilia and morbidity, which highlights the potential

399

issues of using WCVs. It would be interesting to determine the relationship of neutrophilia and

400

WCV immunization in epidemiological past studies but we have not been successful in identifying

401

a study that specifically looked at neutrophilia because studies most note general leukocytosis.

402

In NECre luc mice, the ACV was clearly more protective and less detrimental to the mice

403

than the WCV. Truncated and full-length ACT purified from B. pertussis culture has been shown

404

to be a protective antigen21. Wang et al. described the RTX region of ACT as highly immunogenic

405

and easily purified as a recombinant protein22. We have observed that immunization of CD1 mice

406

with RTX and alum adjuvant results in high anti-RTX titers (data not shown). Here, we immunized

407

NECreluc mice with RTX and alum, but no protection was observed (Fig. 3abc). The previous

408

studies were performed with strain 18323 and the antigen was directly isolated from B.

409

pertussis21,54. It is now known that strain 18323, is an outlier compared to most other global B.

410

pertussis strains and Guiso et a21l. noted that strain 18323 produces less PT than the Tohama I

411

type strain. From our work, we know that UT25 produces more PT and ACT than Tohama I (data

412

not shown). It is possible that due to the increased PT levels produced by UT25, vaccination with

413

RTX was not sufficient to block colonization and proliferation in vivo. Although RTX immunization

414

did not result in clearance of B. pertussis from NECre luc mice, we did observe a reduction in the

415

pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the RTX group compared to not vaccinated and WCV

416

vaccinated and challenged mice (Fig. 5e). PT and ACT have both been shown to induce the

417

production of IL-6 in human cell lines55,56. The anti-ACT antibodies generated by RTX vaccination

418

may play a role in reducing the levels of IL-6 due to reducing the activity of ACT. We hypothesize

419

that it is necessary to neutralize both PT and ACT to provide optimal protection and in future

420

studies, we will test RTX as an antigen in a multivalent ACV containing PT antigen.

421

Using standard immunological analyses, we observed typical Th2 and Th1/17 responses

422

in ACV and WCV immunized mice respectively. B. pertussis utilizes PT and ACT to facilitate

423

survival in the host and most studies about the PT/ACT specific effects have been perform on cell

424

cultures in vitro. Microarray analysis has been used to profile the lung transcriptome of mice

425

challenged with B. pertussis40,57. Here, we sought to use RNAseq to investigate the overall gene

426

expression profiles of the murine lung in response to B. pertussis challenge. Analysis of the lung

427

transcriptome 1 day after B. pertussis challenged exhibited a distinct profile in mice vaccinated

428

with WCV compared to ACV, RTX, or naïve infected mice. This response was consistent with our

429

WCV cytokine profile demonstrating a strong pro-inflammatory response. Similarly, transcriptome

430

data from others during early B. pertussis infection noted an increase in chemokines such as

431

Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Cxcl3, Ccl3, Cxcl1, and Ccl457,58. In Raeven et al, convalescent mice previously

432

infected with B. pertussis exhibited higher expression of these chemokines compared to naïve

433

mice, similar to our whole cell transcriptome where these chemokines are consistently higher than

434

the naïve mice (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). We observed the highest expression of these chemokines in

435

the naïve and RTX mice groups, where these groups had a similar gene profile of genes belonging

436

to the immune cell trafficking and cardiovascular disease annotations (Fig. 7). These findings,

437

along with higher bacterial burden (Fig. 3) suggest that RTX-alum immunization does not provide

438

sufficient protection.

439

Our overall transcriptomic profiling revealed thousands of significant gene expression

440

changes (Fig. 6). After analyzing the neutrophil (Fig. 8), and innate gene changes (Supplementary

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/674408; this version posted June 18, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

441

Fig. 4), we then sought to specifically characterize B cell clone diversity. The RNAseq reads were

442

re-processed with the MiXCR algorithm and we analyzed the abundance and diversity of VDJ

443

clonotypes (Supplementary Fig 5). Besides the T cell response differences of the ACV and WCV

444

(Th2 v. Th1/Th17) another significant difference between these two vaccines is the number of

445

antigens. ACVs have 3-5 antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, FIM2/3) but the WCV hypothetically has

446

~3,000 antigens. In light of this, it would be logical to hypothesize that the WCV would induce a

447

vast antibody repertoire as measured by many VDJ clonotypes. However, we observed a greater

448

diversity and abundance in the ACV group compared to the WCV at both early and late time-

449

points (Supplementary Fig. S6). It is important to point out that this analysis was performed on

450

total lung RNA. If we were to isolate B cells and sequence deeper we would expect to more

451

thoroughly characterize the repertoire. These data are interesting but we do not know which clone

452

types result in functional antibodies that protect against B. pertussis. Further analysis is required

453

to bridge the gap between clonotypes and functional/protective antibodies.

454

Using NeCRE luc mice, we performed tracking neutrophil recruitment during a B. pertussis

455

respiratory infection. These data demonstrate how analysis of cellular responses through in vivo

456

imaging can be used to provide a quantitative parameter throughout a study. This model can be

457

applied to other bacterial infection models or cancer tumor progression models where following

458

the same mouse throughout a study would be beneficial. In this study, we also added next

459

generation sequencing technology to expand upon the immunological findings. RNAseq analysis

460

can be further employed to understand key cell populations and how they are impacted by both

461

immunization and B. pertussis challenge. Our current goal is to continue to refine the murine

462

challenge models with new technological approaches in order to facilitate formulation of new

463

pertussis vaccines. The findings of this study suggest that by integrating RNAseq analysis with

464

classic immunological techniques, it is possible to illuminate novel intricacies of vaccine induced

465

immunity to B. pertussis.

466

Methods

467

Bacteria and culture conditions

468

B. pertussis strain UT25 (UT25Sm1) were cultured on Bordet-Gengou (BG) agar (1906)

469

supplemented with 15% defibrinated sheep blood (Hemostat Laboratories) for 48 h at 36°C59. B.

470

pertussis was then transferred from BG plates to three flasks of 12 ml of modified Stainer-Scholte

471

liquid medium (SSM)60. SSM cultures were not supplemented with cyclodextrin (Heptakis(2,6-di-

472

O-methyl)-β-cyclodextrin). SSM cultures were grown for ~22 h at 36°C with shaking at 180 rpm

473

until the OD600 reached 0.5 on a 1 cm path width spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter DU 530).

474

The cultures were then diluted to 1 x 109/ ml with SSM.

475

Mouse Strains

476

All mouse strains used were bred in a specific pathogen-free experimental conditions within the

477

Office of Laboratory Animal Resources vivarium at West Virginia University. Mice were aged 8 –

478

12 weeks, male and female sex mice were equally assigned to all vaccination groups. 129-

479

Elanetm1(cre)Roes/H mice (Medical Research Council, London, UK) were crossed with

480

FVB.129S6(B6)-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(luc)kael/J mice (Jackson labs; 0051225) resulting in NECre

481

luc progeny. NECre luc mice were injected with CycLuc 1 lucferin (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt,

482

Germany) and confirmed to be luminescent using Xenogen Lumina II61. Upon intraperitoneal

483

injection of a luciferase substrate (luciferin), neutrophils emit luminescence that is detectable

484

using a high sensitivity live animal imaging system (Xenogen IVIS Lumina II).

485

Vaccines used in study and administration

486

All vaccines were formulated into 200 µl doses with the antigen content described below. 100 µl

487

of INFANRIX (GSK) human vaccine (DTaP) which is 1/5 human dose of the vaccine, was mixed

488

in 100 µl of PBS. The NIBSC WHO standard Bordetella pertussis whole-cell vaccine (NIBSC code

489

94/532) was received lyphophilzed and reconstituted in 1ml of PBS. At this concentration one

490

human dose is 100 µl therefore, 20 µl was mixed with 180 µl of PBS, which is 1/5 of the human

491

dose (66 µg of total protein). A truncated ACT protein (RTX) was purified as previously described

492

22

493

to 1 mg of aluminum hydroxide. All immunizations occurred by intraperitoneal injection.

494

Unvaccinated mice received 200 µl of sterile PBS.

495

Vaccination and Challenge with Bordetella pertussis

496

NECre luc mice were bred to ages ranging from (8-12 weeks). Mice were vaccinated at day 0,

497

and then boosted 21 days later. Thirty-five days post initial vaccination, B. pertussis UT25 was

498

grown as described above, and provided as a challenge dose at 2 x 107 CFU in 20 µl. Mice were

499

anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 200 µl of ketamine (6.7 mg/ml) and xylazine (1.3

500

mg/ml) in 0.9% saline. Two 10 µl doses of bacteria were administered through nasal inhalation

501

into each nostril of the mouse. Mice from each of the groups were challenged WCV (8), ACV (8),

502

RTX (6), and naïve control (PBS injection) (5).

503

Collection of murine samples and determination of bacterial burden

504

On days 1,2,4,6, and 9 pc, mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital and

505

dissected in a biosafety cabinet under BSL-2 conditions. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture,

506

serum was separated by centrifugation through a BD Microtainer SST blood collector (BD), or

507

blood for complete blood cell counts were collected in BD Microtainer Tubes with K2EDTA (BD).

508

Trachea and lungs were removed, placed in 1 ml PBS, and then homogenized. Trachea tissue

509

was homogenized by a Brinkman Homogenizer (Polytron), while lung tissue was dissociated

510

using a Dounce homogenizer (Kimble Chase). To determine viable B. pertussis in the nares, 1 ml

511

of PBS was flushed through the nares and collected. In order to determine bacterial burden 100

512

µl of homogenate or nasal lavage was serial diluted in sterile PBS. Four 10 µl aliquots of each

513

serial dilutions were plated on BG containing streptomycin (100 µg/ml) to ensure only UT25 B.

5.6 ug of RTX was combined with 100 µl alum adjuvant (Alhydrogel®, InvivoGen) corresponding

514

pertussis grew on the plates. After 72 h at 36°C colony forming units (CFUs) were counted and

515

the bacterial burden per tissue was calculated. Due to the serial dilutions plated our limit of

516

detection was 103 CFUs per ml or organ. CFUs from experimental groups at each time-point were

517

compared to the naive (PBS injected) and challenged group by a two-tailed unpaired t test using

518

the software package Prism 7 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). All experiments were performed in

519

accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory

520

Animals. All murine infection experiments were performed per protocols approved by the West

521

Virginia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number Damron 14-

522

IVIS imaging

524

NECre luc mice received 83 mg/kg of CycLuc1 luciferin by IP injection (100 µl). Five minutes after

525

injection mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane, mixed with oxygen from the XGI-8 gas

526

anesthesia system supplied with a Xenogen IVIS Lumina II. Luminescent signals were acquired

527

during a five-minute exposure. Acquisition was performed using Living Image 2.5 software

528

(Xenogen). Images were acquired with a binning of 4. Following imaging, mice were either

529

euthanized for dissection and extraction of tissue samples or returned to the vivarium.

530

Luminescence was determined by quantification of photons emitted per second generated in each

531

region of interest (ROI): whole mouse image or nasal cavity. The background of each image was

532

subtracted from the ROI, background photons were defined by the average of two ROIs away

533

from the mouse, for the same image. Data was expressed as relative fold change between target

534

ROIs from experimental groups to an average of ROIs from control mice that were not vaccinated

535

or challenged. Group comparisons were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)

536

followed by a Tukey’s multiple-comparison test using Prism 7.

538

Blood, lung, and cells isolated from nasal lavage were analyzed by flow cytometry. A 100 µl

539

sample was removed from lung homogenate of all samples and filtered through a 70 µm cell

540

strainer, then centrifuged at 1000 x g for 5 mins to pellet cells. Supernatant was removed, and

541

RBC lysis buffer (BD Pharm lysis) added incubated at 37ᵒC for 2 min, then pelleted using the

542

same centrifugation conditions. Cells were resuspended in 500 µl of PBS + 1% FBS, 100µl was

543

aliquoted for antibody staining. After cardiac puncture blood was placed in EDTA containing tube

544

(BD Bioscience), RBC were lysed using Pharmlyse (BD Biosciences) with a 15 min room

545

temperature incubation and then prepared in a similar manner to other tissues. All cell suspension

546

samples were incubated on ice in PBS and 1% FBS for blocking. Antibodies against specific cell

547

surface markers: PE-conjugated GR-1 (BD, 553128) Alexa Fluor 700-conjugated CD11b

548

(Biolegend, 101222) were added to cell suspensions and incubated in the dark for 1 h at 4ᵒC.

549

Lung, blood, and nasal wash suspensions were pelleted, and resuspended in PBS prior to

550

analysis. Samples were read using LSR Fortessa (BD), and analyzed using FlowJo v10 (FlowJo,

551

LLC). PMNs were classified as CD11b+Gr-1+ single, live cells.

552

Cytokine Quantification

553

Lung homogenates were pelleted by centrifugation and then supernatant was collected and

554

stored at -80ᵒC until analysis. Concentration of cytokines in the lungs of vaccinated and

555

challenged mice were determined by quantitative sandwich immunoassays, Meso Scale

556

Discovery (Rockville, MD) V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel (K15048G-1) and Mouse IL-17 Ultra-

557

Sensitive kits (K152ATC-1), following manufacturer’s instructions. Data was analyzed by one-way

558

ANOVA, with a Tukey’s multiple-comparison test for each time-point.

559

Serology

560

Vaccinated and challenged mouse serological responses to RTX, and PT were determined by

561

qualitative ELISA. High-binding 96-well ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4ᵒC with 50 µl of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/674408; this version posted June 18, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

562

purified RTX or Pt in PBS at a concentration of 1 µg/mL. Purified B. pertussis antigens, were

563

obtained from Dr. Jennifer Maynard. Serum samples from NVNC, PBS, ACV, and WCV serum

564

titers were analyzed for PT, as the RTX group had no PT in vaccine. Samples from NVNC, PBS,

565

WCV, and RTX were analyzed for serum antibody titers to RTX, as ACV would not be expected

566

to have RTX titers because no RTX was included in vaccine. Plates were then washed with PBS

567

+ 1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), then blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T for 1 hour at room temperature.

568

Sera were diluted to a concentration in the linear dose range for each antigen. Plates were

569

incubated for 2 h at 37⁰C with serial diluted serum samples from vaccinated groups. Following 3

570

PBS-T washes, 1:4000 goat anti-mouse IgG-AP (Southern Biotech), secondary antibody was

571

added and incubated 1 h at 37⁰C. Plates were washed, then developed for 30 min with 100 µl p-

572

nitrophenyl phosphate. Colorimetric signal was measured using Spectramax i3 (Molecular

573

Devices) at 450nm. An average of blanks was subtracted from all absorbances and used as a

574

baseline detection limit. The minimum detection limit above the baseline was analyzed by one-

575

way ANOVA, with a Tukey’s multiple-comparison test for each time-point using Prism 7.

576

Isolation of Lung RNA, illumina library preparation, and sequencing

577

Lung RNA was prepared similar to previously reported62 with the following modifications. The

578

freshly isolated NECre luc mice lungs were homogenized and RNA was prepared immediately

579

using RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen). Each lung was placed in 1 ml of sterile PBS and then 2 ml

580

of TE lysozyme (1mg/ml) was added and allowed to incubate for 10 min on ice. 2 ml of RLT buffer

581

was added and incubated for another 10 min on ice. The homogenate was then pushed through

582

a syringe needle. The homogenates were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,800g (max speed

583

microfuge) for 10 min. The supernatant was extracted and then 2.8ml of 100% EtOH was added

584

to each tube. This supernatant of each mouse sample was then disturbed to four RNeasy tubes

585

for RNA isolation. The RNA was eluted and pooled into one sample per mouse. The resulting

586

RNA was quantified on a Qubit 3.0 (ThermoFisher) with the high intensity assay kit. Next, the

587

RNA integrity was assessed using Agilent BioAnalyzer RNA Pico chip. All samples were then

588

submitted Ribo-zero rRNA depletion (illumina) and reassessed for RNA integrity. rRNA depleted

589

mRNA samples were then fragmented and prepared into libraries using illumina ScriptSeq

590

Complete Gold (Epidemiology). Libraries were checked for quality control with KAPA qPCR QC

591

assay (KAPA Biosystems). The libraries (33 total) were then sequenced on an illumina HiSeq at

592

the Marshall University Genomics Core facility on 2 lanes of 2x50B. pertussis. Sequencing data

593

were deposited to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and are available under the reference

594

number SRA587785, BioProject number PPJNA394758.

595

RNAseq bioinformatics analyses

596

The reads were analyzed using the software CLC Genomics workbench 9.5. Mus musculus

597

genome was downloaded from NCBI (version GRCm38.78). Reads were mapped against the

598

genome using the following settings for mapping: mismatch cost = 2, insertion cost = 3, deletion

599

cost = 3, length fraction = 0.8, similarity fraction = 0.8. RPKM values were generated using default

600

parameters for CLC Genomics. On average ~20 million reads were obtained for each sample and

601

with stringent parameters ~73% mapped to the murine genome with our mapping parameters.

602

Fold changes in gene expression and statistical analyses were performed using an Extraction of

603

Differential Gene Expression (EDGE) test p value. Expression data for each gene was considered

604

significant if the p value was less than 0.05. Venn diagrams were generated using Venny 2.163.

605

Fold-change of gene expression data was plotted relative to non-challenged control groups at

606

each time-point.

607

worksheets and statistical analyses. Gene list were created using GO terms acquired though

608

AmiGO 2 database including neutrophil (CL:000075), neutrophil activation (GO:0042119),

609

neutrophil migration (GO:1990266), innate immune response (GO: 0045087), T-helper 1 type

610

immune response (GO:0042088), type 2 immune response (GO:0042092), and T-helper 17 type

611

612

Pathway Enrichment Analysis

613

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen) was utilized to map lung transcriptomes to biological and

614

disease functions. Lung transcriptomes were loaded to IPA, and comparative analyses were

615

performed at early and late time-points. Gene expression fold-changes were mapped to higher-

616

order disease and function defined by the IPA knowledge base, and a gene enrichment analysis

617

was performed on early and late time-points. A Fisher Exact T-test was used to determine

618

statistically significant (p < 0.05) p-values of the functions that made up the higher-order disease

619

category and represented as a range of p-values. The relative fold-change of these identified

620

genes was determined, and the 10 highest fold-changes were represented as heat maps.

621
622

Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor profiling

623

B cell clones were identified using MiXCR software (MiLabratory), capable of generating

624

quantitated clonotypes of immunoglobulins48. The same paired-end Illumina sequenced reads

625

mentioned above were merged using concatenation, then imported into MiXCR software. Merged

626

reads were aligned to each other to generate clonotypes of based on VDJ segment regions of

627

unique immunoglobins specific to each sample. Clone data for each sample was grouped based

628

on vaccine received, and time-point. Clonotypes from each sample were then separated into T

629

and B cells, based on T-cell receptor or B-cell receptor specific sequences. Prepared data files

630

were then imported into VDJtools (MiLabratory), for data representation according to established

631

protocol65. Briefly, data was represented to show V-J diversity, and quantify unique clonotypes

632

using dendrograms and chord diagrams.
