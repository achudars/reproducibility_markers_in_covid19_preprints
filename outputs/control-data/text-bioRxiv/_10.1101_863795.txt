ABSTRACT

17

The ecological impacts of extreme climatic events on population dynamics and/or community composition

18

are profound and predominantly negative. Here, using extensive data of an ecological model system, we test

19

whether predictions from ecological models remain robust when environmental conditions are outside the

20

bounds of observation. First, we report a 10-fold demographic decline of the Glanville fritillary butterfly

21

metapopulation on the Åland islands (Finland). Next, using climatic and satellite data we show that the

22

summer of 2018 was an anomaly in terms of water balance and vegetation productivity indices across the

23

habitats of the butterfly, and demonstrate that population growth rates are strongly associated with spatio-

24

temporal variation in climatic water balance. Finally, we demonstrate that covariates that have previously

25

been identified to impact the extinction probability of local populations in this system are less informative

26

when populations are exposed to (severe) drought during the summer months. Our results highlight the

27

unpredictable responses of natural populations to extreme climatic events.

1. INTRODUCTION

29

One of the major challenges in conservation biology is to identify the species and populations that are most

30

vulnerable to extinction. Long-term monitoring of ecological model systems, both at local and global scales,

31

have facilitated conservation objectives by identifying the factors affecting population declines and

32

extinctions (Hanski et al. 1995; Pimm et al. 2014; Dornelas et al. 2019). In addition, ecological models

33

aiming to improve our understanding of population dynamics in temporally varying environments have been

34

employed to shed light on which regions should receive priority for conservation and to predict which

35

species and/or populations are most vulnerable (e.g. Franklin et al. 2014; Oliver et al. 2015). In temporally

36

autocorrelated environments, where conditions tend to change gradually, these predictions may be reliable

37

over short timescales, and can therefore be used to make conservation efforts more effective.

38

When populations are exposed to conditions that are beyond the normal range, such as in the case of extreme

39

climatic events (ECEs), the factors underlying population dynamics may be less relevant and consequently

40

predictions relying on these factors less reliable. ECEs have increased in recent decades, not only in

41

frequency but also in intensity and duration (Jentsch et al. 2007; Coumou & Rahmstorf 2012; Ummenhofer

42

& Meehl 2017). Recent studies have demonstrated that even a single ECE, such as a flood or a drought, can

43

have profound impacts on natural populations (Bailey & van de Pol 2016; Altwegg et al. 2017; Grant et al.

44

2017), and can even cause the collapse of an entire ecosystem (Anderson et al. 2017; Harris et al. 2018). For

45

example, a pan-tropical episode of coral bleaching, triggered by a marine heatwave in 2016, eradicated over

46

60% of the coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef (Hughes et al. 2017).

47

Studies assessing impacts of ECEs are generally conducted by performing perturbation experiments (e.g.

48

Bokhorst et al. 2008; Pansch et al. 2018) or by opportunistically taking advantage of a rare event (e.g. Smith

49

2011; Grant et al. 2017). The latter often concentrate on a single population and relatively small spatial

50

scales, or lack long-term ecological monitoring of the system prior to the ECE (but see Thibault & Brown

51

2008; Campbell-Staton et al. 2017). Here, we report a dramatic demographic decline of the Glanville

52

fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) metapopulation on the Åland archipelago in south-west Finland due to a

53

severe drought in the summer of 2018. This iconic butterfly metapopulation has become an important

54

ecological model system for studying the factors affecting local population dynamics and extinction risks in

55

fragmented landscapes (Hanski 1998; Ovaskainen & Saastamoinen 2018). Due to (ongoing) systematic

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/863795; this version posted December 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

56

monitoring, the system provides a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of how large spatially-

57

structured natural populations respond to extreme climatic conditions, and to study how ECEs affect the

58

value of predictive models.

59

Since 1993, the occupancy and abundance of local populations of the butterflies, across a network of about

60

4400 dry meadows, has been systematically monitored. Estimates of local population sizes are acquired

61

during autumn when all potential habitat patches are surveyed for the presence of the winter nests (for details

62

see; Ojanen et al. 2013). Despite increasing year-to-year fluctuations (Hanski & Meyke 2005; Tack et al.

63

2015), the overall size of the metapopulation has remained relatively stable, with about 20% of the available

64

habitat patches being occupied each year. Survey data have been used to demonstrate that the long-term

65

persistence and population dynamics (local extinctions and re-colonizations) of the metapopulation largely

66

depends on the number of available habitat patches, their area, and their spatial configuration (i.e.

67

connectivity; Hanski & Ovaskainen 2000; Dallas et al. 2019). Other key factors impacting local extinctions

68

and population dynamics are the habitat quality (e.g. amount of host plants; Harrison et al. 2011; Schulz et al.

69

2019) and genetic characteristics of the individuals (Saccheri et al. 1998; Niitepõld & Saastamoinen 2017).

70

We recently demonstrated that variation in population growth rates is strongly associated with variation in

71

temperature and precipitation across the habitat patch network (Kahilainen et al. 2018). Spatial variability in

72

these climatic conditions contributes to the overall stability of the metapopulation by ensuring that local

73

extinctions are compensated by stable or increased population sizes and colonization rates in other areas of

74

the metapopulation. As the climatic conditions have become more homogeneous across Åland in the last

75

decade, the Glanville fritillary metapopulation has now become more spatially synchronous in its

76

demographic dynamics (Kahilainen et al. 2018), potentially making it more vulnerable to large-scale

77

environmental perturbations (Hanski & Woiwod 1993).

78

Here, we identify the key anomalies that occurred in the summer of 2018 on the Åland islands and

79

demonstrate that exposure to these extremes was sufficient to drive the regional population declines of the

80

butterfly observed across the metapopulation. Secondly, we explore how the ECE impacts the performance

81

of ecological models by testing whether the covariates that have previously been identified to affect local

82

extinctions in this system remain informative under extreme climatic conditions.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS

84

2.1 Long-term data survey

85

On the Åland islands, the Glanville fritillary inhabits dry meadows and pastures with at least one of the two

86

larval host plant species, the ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata) or the spiked speedwell (Veronica

87

spicata) present. The entire study region (50 × 70 km) has been mapped for potential habitat patches, with a

88

total of 4,415 patches (September 2015). The population occupancy (presence of a larval nest within a

89

habitat patch) and abundance (total number of larval nests within a habitat patch) is assessed annually when

90

the larvae have entered the overwintering stage within their conspicuous larval nests. All the habitat patches

91

on the archipelago are inspected with the help of approximately 50 field assistants. In the field, the locations

92

of the larval nests are marked and data are stored into the EarthCape database (Ojanen et al. 2013). The

93

occupancy and abundance data comprise raw counts, which is a function of both population size but also of

94

detection probability. Estimates from control surveys conducted before 2018 suggest that the presence of the

95

butterfly may be missed in up to 15% of the occupied patches, with non-detection mainly occurring in very

96

small populations (Hanski et al. 2017).

97

2.2 Climatic and vegetation index data

98

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values were

99

derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS, resolution 250 m; Guay et al. 2014).

100

Both NDVI and EVI data are available on a 16-day basis for a 19-year period between 2000 and 2018. Data

101

are derived from bands 1 and 2 of the MODIS on board NASA's Terra satellite. A time-series of NDVI and

102

EVI observations can be used to examine the dynamics of the growing season, ecosystem health or monitor

103

phenomena such as droughts. EVI is an 'optimized' vegetation index designed to enhance the vegetation

104

signal with improved sensitivity in high biomass regions and improved vegetation monitoring through a

105

decoupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in atmosphere influences. NDVI and EVI

106

values were calculated for each of the 4,415 habitat patches from April to August. Monthly temperature and

107

precipitation values and water balance (precipitation - potential evaporation) are derived from Jomala

108

weather station (60.18° N, 19,99° E, 11 m a.s.l.) database. Climatic water balance was quantified by

109

precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (PET). PET is the amount of evaporation and transpiration

110

that would occur if a sufficient water source were available. PET was calculated using the Penman-Monteith

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/863795; this version posted December 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

111

equation (Guo et al. 2016). Based on the climatic water balance values a time-series of the Standardized

112

Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was calculated (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2009). An important

113

advantage of the SPEI is that it can be computed at different time scales. This way it is possible to

114

incorporate the influence of the past values of the variable in the computation, and the magnitude of these

115

values is by parameter scale. For example, a value of three would imply that data from the current month and

116

of the past two months will be used for computing the SPEI or SPI value for a given month.

117

2.3 Population growth rate model

118

Following an analysis pipeline developed for the Glanville fritillary metapopulation (Kahilainen et al. 2018),

119

we fitted a Bayesian linear mixed effects model to study the association between weather conditions and

120

population growth rate at the regional scale. Instead of using monthly temperature and precipitation values,

121

we used monthly water balance indices, which are more explicitly associated with drought conditions. We

122

first divided individual habitat patches into groups of spatially clustered semi-independent habitat patch

123

networks (SIN; see Hanski et al. 2017) and derived yearly population growth rates (r) as:

,

124
125

where NSIN,t is the number of overwintering larval nest found in a SIN in the fall of year t. We then extracted

126

water balance data for each SIN (see previous section) and fitted a linear mixed model for population growth

127

rate using the water balance values across different life-history stages of the butterfly as covariates. In the

128

model we included a random intercept and a first order autocorrelation term for each SIN. We implemented

129

the model in Stan statistical modelling platform (Carpenter et al. 2017), using R packages brms (version

130

2.7.0; Bürkner 2017) and RStan (2.17.3; Stan Development Team 2018) as its interface. For further details

131

regarding the analysis pipeline and implementation of the model, see Kahilainen et al. 2018. From the model

132

we then obtained fitted annual growth rates for each of the 33 SINs included in the data and compared these

133

with the observed growth rate values (Fig. 3).

134

2.4 Extinction probability model

135

We fitted a linear mixed effect model (logit link function) to binary patch extinction data calculated for each

136

year of the survey between 1999 and 2018 to examine whether the high extinction rates in 2018 could be

137

attributable to covariates previously recognized to impact the extinction probability of local populations

138

(Hanski et al. 1995; Saccheri et al. 1998). Year was included as a random effect. Environmental variables

139

included as fixed effects were the natural logarithm of patch area, the amount of the dominant host plant in

140

each patch estimated on a scale of 1-3, the percent of host plants that were dried out, and the percent of the

141

patch that was grazed (see Ojanen et al. 2013 for more details). Historical contingency was accounted for by

142

considering the natural logarithm of the number of larval nests in each focal patch in the previous year, and

143

the number of larval nests in the neighbourhood of each focal patch in the previous year, defined as:

144
145

where, d is the distance between focal patch i and j, and Nj is the number of nests in patch j in the previous

146

year. We trained the model using 80% of the data, and subsequently assessed model performance –

147

quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) – on the remaining 20% of the

148

data. This procedure was repeated 10 times in order to assess the sensitivity of model performance to the

149

train/test split.

150

3. RESULTS

151

3.1 Demographic declines across the butterfly metapopulation in 2018

152

Despite systematic surveying efforts, an all-time low of only 91 larval nests were recorded during the autumn

153

survey in 2018 (the average number of nests recorded each year is 2750; figure 1). The number of occupied

154

habitat patches was also an order of magnitude lower than in any average year (N=54; figure 1A), and only a

155

single colonization event was recorded. The number of larval nests recorded within the occupied habitat

156

patches was approximately 65% below the average (table S1).

157

3.2 Large deviations from past climatic conditions

158

Like many regions in Northern Europe, the habitat patches on the Åland islands received remarkably low

159

levels of precipitation in the summer of 2018. The effect of this shortage was intensified by record-breaking

160

temperatures (figure S1), resulting in the lowest climatic water balance values on record at the Jomala

161

weather station in Åland (1960-2018; figure 2A). Consequently, the summer of 2018 was anomalous also in

162

terms of primary productivity. Satellite-derived vegetation indices [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index

163

(NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)], available since 2000, demonstrate low levels of vegetation

164

productivity within the pastures and dry meadows inhabited by the butterfly in 2018 (figure 2B). The latter

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/863795; this version posted December 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

165

likely reflects also reduced host plant quality and availability during the periods when the post- and pre-

166

diapause butterfly larvae are feeding (see figure 1B).

167

3.3 Drought drives regional population declines

168

We examined whether the extreme climatic conditions experienced by the butterfly in 2018 were sufficient to

169

drive population declines at the scale of the semi-independent patch networks (SINs; Hanski et al. 2017).

170

Overall, monthly water balance indices – especially the water deficits during May and July – were highly

171

associated with population declines at the SIN level (figure 3; table S2). With few exceptions, the model

172

residuals for 2018 were negative, indicating that the observed declines in most SINs were more severe than

173

suggested by the model fit (figure 3). Indeed, SIN level population declines in 2018 were among the most

174

dramatic ones observed since the start of the annual survey, with nearly 80% of the growth rate values falling

175

within the lowest 5 percentile (figure 3; table S1).

176

3.4 Summer drought decreases the predictability of local extinctions

177

We first confirmed the previously identified factors affecting extinction probability of local populations in

178

this system. In short, the probability of extinction is lower in habitat patches that are large and well-

179

connected. Patches with low population densities in the previous year, reduced host plant availability, or

180

those used for livestock grazing, have higher extinction probabilities (table S3). Secondly, we estimated the

181

predictive accuracy of our environmental extinction model. The mean AUC score across the 20 years was

182

0.76, implying that model covariates predict the extinction of a local population reasonably well (figure 4a;

183

AUC scores above 0.80 reflect good discrimination (Swets 1988). The AUC scores varied significantly

184

across years with the lowest values observed in years that are characterized by water deficits during summer

185

(figure 4b). Model covariates were more likely to predict the extinction probability correctly in the years

186

prior to the ECE of 2018.

4. DISCUSSION

189

The ongoing climate crisis is expected to result in a rapid increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of

190

extreme climatic events (e.g. Sun et al. 2014; Fischer & Knutti 2015). Owing to the profound impacts these

191

extreme events can have on ecological functioning, the vulnerability of natural populations to the impacts of

192

climate change may be severely underestimated (Anderson et al. 2017; Ummenhofer & Meehl 2017).

193

The Åland islands, like many other regions across the northern-hemisphere, sustained severe drought in the

194

summer of 2018. Using extensive long-term data of the spatially-structured natural population of the

195

Glanville fritillary butterfly, we demonstrate that both the climatic conditions during the summer and

196

biological response of the metapopulation exceeded the 5% threshold values typically used to define ECEs

197

(van de Pol et al. 2017). The majority of studies investigating the impacts of ECEs have focussed on the

198

ability of organisms to cope with the direct effects of the extreme environmental conditions (Hoffmann &

199

Sgrò 2018). While an organisms' critical physiological limits are likely to be important risk factors,

200

extinctions of local populations could also be triggered indirectly (Maron et al. 2015). Our estimates of the

201

occupancy and abundance of local populations across the archipelago are collected in the autumn, and hence

202

only represent populations that survived the potentially harsh summer conditions. Therefore, we cannot infer

203

whether the population declines and local extinctions were triggered directly by the arid conditions, or

204

indirectly through for example climate-induced restrictions in resource availability (Maron et al. 2015).

205

Nonetheless, using satellite-derived vegetation indices we demonstrate here that productivity was

206

substantially reduced within the habitat patches of the butterflies in 2018. These data suggest that the severe

207

drought negatively impacted the quality and availability of the host plants of these herbivorous insects,

208

making resources scarce when demands were high. These results are in line with detailed observations made

209

in 12 focal patches in 2018, where despite observing large numbers of clutches in early summer only two

210

larval nests were found in autumn (Salgado et al. under review).

211

We explored whether the strong deviations from usually experienced conditions influenced our ability to

212

forecast the short-term biological response of the metapopulation, both at a regional and local scale. First, we

213

demonstrate that the population growth rates at regional scales (i.e. the level of SINs; Hanski et al. 2017) are

214

positively associated with climatic water balance during summer months (table S2). In other words,

215

population sizes of this drought-sensitive butterfly species declined in years that were characterized by water

216

deficits during summer (see also Oliver et al. 2015; Kahilainen et al. 2018). This result strongly points

217

towards climatic conditions as the key driver of the dramatic decline of the metapopulation in 2018. In

218

addition, we find that the relationship between the climatic variables and the biological response of the

219

metapopulation is largely linear (i.e. model residuals of 2018 are negative, but generally do not exceed model

220

confidence limits; figure 3; van de Pol et al. 2017). These results highlight that our detailed understanding of

221

the population dynamics of this ecological system allowed us to – at least in part – forecast the observed

222

population declines in response to the described extreme event.

223

While we were able to capture climate-induced changes in dynamics at regional scales, we were less

224

successful in predicting the extinction probabilities of local populations in 2018 (figure 4a). In general, the

225

model covariates, such as habitat size and connectivity, were likely to predict the extinction probability

226

correctly in years when water availability was reduced during summer. In 2018, even populations inhabiting

227

large and well-connected patches with high abundance in the previous year went extinct. This suggests that

228

summer droughts, and in particular the extreme climatic conditions of 2018, may force the population over a

229

threshold in which local extinctions are driven by factors other than those highlighted in previous studies

230

with the system (reviewed in Ovaskainen & Saastamoinen 2018). Hence, uncharacterised ecological

231

variables, such as the water holding capacity of the patch and/or the microhabitat heterogeneity within each

232

meadow or pasture, may potentially be important determinants of population persistence under arid

233

environmental conditions. In addition, stochastic processes may become more important in dry years.

234

As a potential caveat we note that, despite using a systematic and methodical protocol, our probability to

235

detect the presence of the butterfly is known to be reduced in very small populations (Hanski et al. 2017).

236

Hence, strong climate-induced declines in population sizes may therefore contribute to decreased detection

237

rates (and, consequently, an overestimation of the biological response). Other variables, such as reduced nest

238

sizes or shifts in habitat choice, may potentially also negatively affect detectability under climatic extremes.

239

However, our surveying protocol dictates that when a patch is judged to be unoccupied, it should

240

immediately be re‐surveyed with the same effort (Ojanen et al. 2013). Owing to this safeguard mechanism

241

the majority of the patches were surveyed twice in 2018, reducing the potential influence of the ECE on nest

242

detectability.

243

The documentation of the demographic crash of the Glanville fritillary metapopulation highlights the

244

vulnerability of natural populations and underscores the importance of long-term monitoring programs to

245

effectively document the consequences of ECEs on species, population and community dynamics. Our

246

results further demonstrate that ECEs can impede conservation efforts by reducing the value of predictive

247

models. For example, even within this extensively understood study system any effort to potentially mitigate

248

the impacts of the ECE on local populations would likely have failed, since we would not have been able to

249

predict which local populations were most vulnerable. The long-term implications of the ECE of 2018 are

250

yet to be realized and continuation of the metapopulation survey during the following years will demonstrate

251

whether the disruption from the normal extinction-colonization dynamics has driven this iconic

252

metapopulation close to its tipping point (Dai et al. 2013) or whether the remaining populations will recover

253

from this rare perturbation event. In the case of the latter, this will provide a unique and exciting opportunity

254

to study the long-term ecological and evolutionary impacts of an ECE in a spatially-structured population.

Patches: the number of habitat patches included in the survey (survey extended between 1997-1999; peripheral islands
not included in 2018); Populations: the number of patches that were occupied by the butterfly; Abundance: the mean
number of nests per population; GR SIN (N) the number of viable SINs (33) for which a population growth rate could be
estimated; % in lower 5%: percentage of population growth rates that fall within the 5% most negative values recorded in
the Åland islands (see figure 2 in the main text).

then separately for each month corresponding to the different life stages of the butterfly. The meteorological
data in 1958-2018 are derived from the Jomala climate station database in Åland. The vegetation index data
were derived from bands 1 and 2 of the MODIS on board NASA's Terra satellite and calculated for the 4,415
habitat patches of the Glanville fritillary butterfly in the Åland islands. Illustrations courtesy of Luisa
