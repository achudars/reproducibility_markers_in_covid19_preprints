Abstract

14

Drug combinations are becoming a standard treatment of many complex diseases due to their

15

capability to overcome resistance to monotherapy. Currently, in the preclinical drug combination

16

screening, the top hits for further study are often selected based on synergy alone, without considering

17

the combination efficacy and toxicity effects, even though these are critical determinants for the

18

clinical success of a therapy. To promote the prioritization of drug combinations based on integrated

19

analysis of synergy, efficacy and toxicity profiles, we implemented a web-based open-source tool,

20

SynToxProfiler (Synergy-Toxicity-Profiler). When applied to 20 anti-cancer drug combinations tested

21

both in healthy control and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) patient cells, as well as to 77 anti-

22

viral drug pairs tested on Huh7 liver cell line with and without Ebola virus infection, SynToxProfiler

23

was shown to prioritize synergistic drug pairs with higher selective efficacy (difference between

24

efficacy and toxicity level) as top hits, which offers improved likelihood for clinical success.

Introduction

27

High throughput screening (HTS) of approved and investigational agents in preclinical model systems

28

has been established as an efficient technique to identify candidate drug combinations to be further

29

developed as safe and effective treatment options for many diseases, such as HIV, tuberculosis and

30

various types of cancers [1, 2]. Currently, the selection of top combinations for further development

31

often relies merely on the observed synergy between drugs, while neglecting their actual efficacy and

32

potential toxic effects, that are the other key determinants for the therapeutic success of drugs in the

33

clinics [3]. Notably, around 20% of drugs fail in the early development phase because of safety

34

concerns (non-tolerated toxicity), and over 50% fail due to lack of sufficient efficacy [4]. Further, a

35

recent study argued that many clinically-used anticancer combination therapies confer benefit simply

36

due to patient-to-patient variability, not because of drug additivity or synergy [3], indicating that even

37

non-synergistic combinations may be beneficial for therapeutic purposes if they have a high enough

38

efficacy and low enough toxicity profiles. To make a better use of these various components of drug

39

combination performance already in preclinical HTS experiments, we implemented, to the best of our

40

knowledge, the first web-tool, SynToxProfiler, which enables users to profile synergy, toxicity and

41

efficacy of drug combinations simultaneously for the top hit prioritization and is also extendible for

42

multi-drug (3 or more drugs) combination screening.

Methods

45

SynToxProfiler workflow

46

The SynToxProfiler web-application is freely available at https://syntoxprofiler.fimm.fi, together with

47

example drug combination data, video tutorial and user instructions. SynToxProfiler enables ranking of

48

drug combinations based on integrated efficacy, synergy and toxicity profiles (Fig.1). Therefore, for

49

each drug combination, SynToxProfiler first calculates a normalized volume under dose-response

50

surface to quantify combination efficacy based on doseâ€“response measurements on diseased cells, e.g.

51

patient derived primary cells (see Suppl. Fig. 1). Then, the combination synergy between each drug

52

pair is estimated using one of the synergy scoring models: Highest Single-Agent [5], Bliss

53

independence [6], Loewe additivity [7], or Zero Interaction Potency [8], as implemented in the

54

SynergyFinder R-package [9]. Normalized volume under the dose-synergy surface is utilized to

55

quantify final combination synergy score (Suppl. Fig. 1A). Next, using the measurements on control

56

cells, if available, the normalized volume under doseâ€“response matrix is calculated to estimate

57

combination toxicity (Suppl. Fig. 1). Finally, SynToxProfiler ranks the drug combinations based on

58

integrated combination synergy, efficacy and toxicity (STE) score. Alternatively, if measurement on

59

control cells are not available, then the ranking of drug pairs can also be done based merely on

60

combination synergy and efficacy. As a result of the interactive analysis, SynToxProfiler provides a

61

web-based exportable report, which allows users to interactively explore their results (Fig. 1 and

62

Suppl.

63

https://syntoxprofiler.fimm.fi/example. A more detailed description of the calculations and workflow is

provided in the technical documentation, https://syntoxprofiler.fimm.fi/howto.

Fig. 1. A schematic overview of SynToxProfiler. The dose-response data from drug combination

68

screening, measured in both diseased (e.g. patient-derived cells) and healthy control cells (e.g.

69

PBMCs), is provided as input to SynToxProfiler (left panel). Then, SynToxProfiler quantifies drug

70

combination efficacy and synergy (using combination responses in diseased cells) as well as toxicity

71

(using combination responses in control cells) for each drug pair (middle panel), and summarizes them

72

into integrated synergy, toxicity and efficacy (STE) score. The STE score is further used to rank and

73

visualize the drug pairs in 2D or 3D interactive plots (right panel).

Calculation of normalized volume

76

The normalized volume under the dose-response surface is calculated while quantifying combination

77

efficacy and toxicity based on measurements on diseased and control cells, respectively (Suppl. Fig. 1).

78

Synergy score was calculated based on measurements on diseased cells as normalized volume under

79

synergy matrix (excess matrix of combination responses over expected responses determined by one of

80

the synergy models, such as Bliss). For each combination AB of drugs, A and B, the normalized

81

volume under the dose-response surface VAB is calculated as:

approach for volume-based scoring normalizes for the different dose-ranges measured in different drug

87

combinations, as commonly occurring in HTS settings. The extension of formulation for volume -

88

based scoring of synergy, efficacy and toxicity profiles for multi-drug combinations (3 or more drugs)

89

is given in the supplementary file.

91

Ranking of drug combinations

92

SynToxProfiler ranks the drug combinations based on an integrative analysis of synergy, toxicity and

93

efficacy, quantified as STE score. First, the difference in efficacy (EAB) and toxicity volume scores

94

(TAB) is calculated for each drug combination to quantify a selective response in diseased cells, relative

95

to that of control cells. We defined this difference as a selective efficacy score (sEAB) of a drug

96

combination. This theoretical concept for selective efficacy has been adopted from the single drug

97

dose-response assays, where the difference in normalized areas under the curve (AUC) between

98

diseased and healthy cells is often used to calculate the patient-specific drug efficacies [10, 11]. The

99

final STE score is given by averaging two different ranks of (i) combination synergy score (SAB) (the

100

higher is the synergy, the higher is the rank), and (ii) selective combination efficacy (sEAB) (the higher

101

is selective efficacy, the higher is the rank):

where SAB and sEAB are the synergy and selective efficacy scores, respectively, for a combination of

103

drug A and B, calculated using the normalized volume under the dose-response surface; and N is the

104

total number of drug combinations being tested. However, since calculation of STE score using the

105

whole dose-response matrix may miss some of the top hit drug combinations with a narrow synergistic

106

dose window, SynToxProfiler also offers the users a possibility to rank combinations based on the

107

selective efficacy and synergy scores calculated only at the most synergistic area of the drug

108

combination matrix (defined as the 3x3 concentration window with the highest synergy in the dose-

109

response matrix), instead of the default full matrix calculation.

111

Data submission and reporting

112

The default input of SynToxProfiler is a text or xlsx file that comprises annotations of each drug

113

combination doseâ€“response matrix, including drug names, concentrations, cell types (e.g. sample or

114

control), and phenotypic responses (e.g. relative inhibition). The number of drug combinations

115

provided in the input file is unrestricted. More information on the input file format is given in the

116

website documentation (https://syntoxprofiler.fimm.fi/howto/). As the result, SynToxProfiler provides

117

an interactive visualization of STE scores using bar charts, as well as 2- and 3-dimensional scatter

122

Drug combination assay

123

The in-house drug combination testing was carried out at Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland

124

(FIMM), in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a patient with T-cell prolymphocytic

125

leukemia (T-PLL) and a healthy volunteer were used in accordance with the regulations of Finnish

126

Hematological Registry and biobank (FHRB). The written informed consents were obtained from both

127

participants and the study was carried in accordance with the principles of Helsinki declarations.

128

Twenty combinations of drugs with different mechanisms of actions (see Supplementary Table S1)

129

were tested on the PBMCs in 8x8 dose-response matrix assay as described previously [12, 13]. Briefly,

130

20 microliters of cell suspension along with compounds (in 8 different concentrations including zero

131

dose) and their combinations were plated on clear bottom 384-well plates (Corning #3712), using an

132

Echo 550 Liquid Handler (Labcyte). The concentration ranges were selected for each compound

133

separately to investigate the full dynamic range of dose-response relationships. After 72 hours

134

incubation at 37Â°C and 5% CO2, cell viability of each well was measured using the CellTiter-Glo

135

luminescent assay (Promega) and a Pherastar FS (BMG Labtech) plate reader. As positive (total

136

killing) and negative (non-effective) controls, we used 100 Î¼M benzethonium chloride and 0.1 %

137

dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively, for calculating the relative efficacy (% inhibition).

138

The published dataset of 78 antiviral drug combinations was tested at the Integrated Research

139

Facility, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in the Huh7 liver cells

140

infected with Makona isolate, Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/GIN/14/WPG-C05, as described in the original

141

study [14] (data available at https://matrix.ncats.nih.gov/matrix-client/rest/matrix/blocks/6323/table

142

and https://matrix.ncats.nih.gov/matrix-client/rest/matrix/blocks/6324/table). Briefly, drugs in 50-ÂµL of

143

Dulbeccoâ€™s modified Eagleâ€™s medium were transferred to the Huh7 cells seeded in black, clear-

144

bottomed, 96-well plates 1 hour prior to inoculation with EBOV/Mak. After 48 hours of viral

145

inoculation, drug combination efficacy was measured in triplicates with a 6 Ã— 6 dose-response matrix

146

design using CellTiter-Glo assays (Promega). The EBOV/Mak virus was detected using mouse

147

antiEBOV VP40 antibody. For the toxicity measurements, the same CellTiter-Glo assay was

148

performed on nonâ€“virus-infected Huh7 cells with 3 replicates for each drug concentration, and the

149

assay was repeated at least twice for confirmation. We utilized 77 out of the 78 combinations for the

150

present analysis, as colchicine-colchicine pair was removed because the inhibition levels were 100%

151

for all the tested concentrations for the drug combination.

Results

153

SynToxProfiler prioritizes clinically useful drug combination as top hits for T-PLL cancer patient and

154

Ebola virus infection

155

To demonstrate the performance of SynToxProfiler in prioritizing therapeutically-relevant synergistic

156

combinations, we applied it to in-house drug screening data involving 20 drug combinations tested in

157

one control and one T-PLL patient-derived cells. The T-PLL case study revealed that ranking of

158

combinations based on the STE score successfully prioritizes both effective and safe drug pairs. For

159

example, Cytarabine-Daunorubicin pair was identified as the top hit out of the tested combinations

160

(Table 1, Additional File 1); this combination is widely used as approved induction therapy for acute

161

myeloid leukemia treatment [15,16]. Ibrutinib-Navitoclax was ranked as the third-best combination for

162

further study; this combination has shown promising results in phase II clinic trail (NCT02756897) for

163

chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and recently suggested as first-line treatment for CLL [17].

167

Synergy scores were calculated using ZIP [8] model (default option in SynToxProfiler).

168
169

To further illustrate the wide applicability of SynToxProfiler also in non-cancer combinatorial screens,

170

we used a published dataset of 77 drug combinations tested as anti-viral agents where the drug

171

combinationsâ€™ efficacy and toxicity were tested in Ebola-infected and nonâ€“virus-infected Huh7 liver

172

cells, respectively. SynToxProfiler ranked established combinations (e.g. clomifene-sertraline and

173

sertraline-toremifene) that inhibit EBOV fusion to cell surface as top hits for further study (Additional

174

File 2). All the three drugs (clomifene, sertraline and toremifene) showed survival benefit in in-vivo

175

murine Ebola virus infection model [18], indicating that SynToxProfiler prioritizes drug pairs with a

176

strong potential to be rapidly advanced towards clinical settings and used as therapeutic interventions.

177
178

Top hits selected by SynToxProfiler based on integrated scoring are synergistic drug pairs with higher

179

selective efficacy

180

We compared the synergy and selective efficacy level of the top hits prioritized based on the STE

181

score, synergy score and selective efficacy scores, using the 77 combinations in the Ebola dataset. The

182

top combinations identified by STE scores had a notably higher selective efficacy as well as higher

183

synergy (shown by arrow in Fig. 2A), indicating that STE score represents a proper balance between

184

high selective efficacy and synergy. Additionally, we observed a marked overlap (65%) between the

185

top-10% of analyzed combinations prioritized based on STE score and synergy score, as well as based

186

on the STE score and selective efficacy score (50% overlap), as shown in Fig. 2B. In contrast, there

187

was a smaller overlap (41%) between the top-10% hits selected based on selective efficacy and

188

synergy scores. Further, a low Pearson correlation (r=0.22) between selective efficacy and synergy was

189

observed. These results indicate that synergy and selective efficacy are independent drug combination

190

components, which cannot be used alone to prioritize potent and less toxic synergistic drug

191

combinations.

200

denotes the overlap between the top 10% combinations selected based on any of the three scores).

201
202

A more detailed analysis revealed that SynToxProfiler ranks lower the toxic drug pairs despite their

203

higher synergy (e.g. clomifene-colchicine and toremifene citrate-apilimod). For example,

204

SyntoxProfiler ranked clomiphene citrate and sertraline HCl combination (STE=0.96) as the top hit

205

(Fig.3), despite its lower synergy as compared to more synergistic toremifene citrate and apilimod pair

206

(STE=0.86). This is due to a higher toxicity (13.30 vs 24.60) of latter, although both of the drug

207

combinations have similar efficacy scores (70.88 vs 68.20). The lower ranking of combinations

208

involving cilchicine and apilimod is in accordance with their observed extreme toxicity in the clinic

209

[19,20]. This case study indicates that SynToxProfiler can identify safe top hits with high selective

210

efficacy and synergy that have increased potential for clinical success, as compared to hits selected

211

based on synergy alone.

and apilimod, lower panel). The synergy was calculated using the ZIP model implemented in

218

SynergyFinder. The square with dotted line denotes the 3x3 concentration range with the most

219

synergistic area in the dose-response matrix.

220
221

Discussion and conclusions

222

The primary motivation for the use of synergistic drug combinations in the clinic is to achieve higher

223

efficacy (by means of drug interaction) with reduced toxicity (by decreasing the drug doses).

224

Therefore, the HTS screening aims to discover drug pairs that are more effective than the individual

225

single drugs, and, at the same time, show less toxicity for the patients. Hence, the assessment of

226

synergistic efficacy along with toxicity is critical for the selection of candidate drug pairs for further

227

study, as there exists a fundamental trade-off between clinical efficacy and tolerable toxicity.

228
229

To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no methods to provide the global view in terms of

230

synergy, efficacy and toxicity of drug pairs in an HTS setting. In this respect, SynToxProfiler offers an

231

important advancement into the current practice for drug combination selection, as it provides an easy-

232

to-use platform for in-vitro or ex-vivo assessment of the three critical aspects of drug combinations

233

that are necessary for success in the clinics. Furthermore, SynToxProfiler facilitates the identification

of therapeutic window range at which the drugs show highest synergy, high efficacy and lowest

235

toxicity by visualization of the dose-response surfaces. Since, SynToxProfiler uses the normalized

236

volume-based scoring for synergy, efficacy and toxicity levels (see methods and supplementary file),

237

the SynToxProfiler framework can be easily utilized to prioritize synergistic drug combinations with

238

high selective efficacy for multi-component (3 or more drugs) drug combination screening. Since

239

limited number of tools and methodology are available to analyze and interpret either synergy, efficacy

240

or toxicity of multi-component drug combinations, SynToxProfiler will be valuable resource for

241

screening of such combinations.

242
243

In this work, we showed how SynToxProviler prioritized cytarabine-daunorubicin as the top drug pair

244

out of 20 anticancer combinations for T-PLL case study (Table 1), and clomifene-sertraline for anti-

245

viral case study (Additional file 2). The identification of clinically established drug pairs as top hit

246

suggests that ranking based on all the three parameters can help to identify combinations that have

247

more chance to success in the clinic. These effective and safe combinations would have been otherwise

248

missed if combinations were selected merely based on their synergy scores.

249
250

In conclusion, we have developed SynToxProfiler, an interactive tool for top hit prioritization that

251

ranks drug pairs based on their combined synergy, efficacy and toxicity profile, and which can be

252

applied to any HTS drug combination screening project. We showed how this tool enable identification

253

of clinically established drug pairs as top hits and many more drug pairs with a translational potential.

254

We foresee SynToxProfiler will allow for more unbiased and systematic means to evaluate the pre-

255
256
257

clinical potency of drug combinations toward safe and effective therapeutic applications.

258

AI and AKG developed and tested the integrated scoring. AI implemented the platform and AKG

259

helped in designing and testing of the platform. ST performed the in-house drug combination screening

260

in T-PLL case study. AI prepared figures for manuscript and finalized with AKG. TA helped in

261

designing of the project and writing of the manuscript. AKG, TA, AI and AK conceptualized the study

262

and wrote the manuscript. All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.
