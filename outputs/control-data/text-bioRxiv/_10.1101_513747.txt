demonstration of an anti-tumour role of endogenous AMPs is lacking. Using a

28

Drosophila model of tumourigenesis, we demonstrate a role for the AMP

29

Defensin in the control of tumour progression. Our results reveal that Tumour

30

Necrosis Factor mediates exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), which makes

31

tumour cells selectively sensitive to the action of Defensin remotely secreted

32

from tracheal and fat tissues. Defensin binds tumour cells in PS-enriched

33

areas, provoking cell death and tumour regression. Altogether, our results

34

provide the first in vivo demonstration for a role of an endogenous AMP as an

35

anti-cancer agent, as well as a mechanism that explains tumour cell sensitivity

36

to the action of AMPs.

Introduction

40

Vast amount of evidence demonstrates the key role of systemic

41

immunity in tumour progression and patient outcome. Efforts to manipulate

42

the immune response to tumours are at the core of basic and translational

43

cancer research. In mammals and flies, tumourigenesis triggers inflammation

44

and activation of the immune system, leading to tumour cell death (Cordero et

45

al., 2010; Parameswaran and Patial, 2010; Parisi et al., 2014; Teng et al.,

46

2008). Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) is an important player in these

47

tumour/immune interactions and has pleiotropic effects on tumours, including

48

induction of cell death (Ham et al., 2016; Parameswaran and Patial, 2010).

49

This function is conserved in Drosophila, where the single TNF homolog Eiger

50

(Egr), produced by tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), has been shown

51

to drive cell death of neoplastic tumours, generated in larval imaginal discs by

52

the loss of apico-basal complex components such as Disc large 1, Scribble or

53

Lethal giant larvae (Cordero et al., 2010; Parisi et al., 2014; Parvy et al.,

54

2018). Moreover, using disc large 1 Drosophila mutant larvae (dlg40.2 hereafter

55

referred to as dlg), we recently reported that tumour-derived Egr, acts on

56

haemocytes to activate Toll pathway in the Drosophila fat body, which was

57

necessary to mediate TNF-dependent tumour cell death (Parisi et al., 2014).

58

However, the mechanisms by which Toll signalling activation in immune

59

tissues executes tumour cell death remain unknown (Figure 1A).

60

In Drosophila as in mammals, Toll pathway is well known to play a

61

central role in the innate immune response to infection (Lemaitre et al., 1996).

62

Downstream effectors of the Toll pathway include antimicrobial peptides

63

(AMPs), which possess microbicidal activities against various pathogens.

64

They display potent antimicrobial activity in vitro by disrupting negatively-

65

charged microbial membranes. While intracellular activities have been

66

reported, many AMPs kill pathogens by inserting into the lipid bilayer and

67

disrupting the membrane integrity (Brogden, 2005). Host cells are instead

68

protected from AMP as they are positively charged and contain cholesterol

69

(Brender et al., 2012). In vitro studies have revealed AMPs capacity to kill

70

cancer cells (Deslouches and Di, 2017). However, whether this cancer-killing

71

activity is a natural function of AMPs is unknown, as there are no reports on

72

an in vivo paradigm addressing such question. Since the Toll pathway is

73

activated in dlg mutant tumour bearing larvae and is required for optimal TNF-

74

induced tumour cell death (Parisi et al., 2014), we hypothesised that AMPs

75

may be involved in this process.

76

Here we show that Drosophila defensin is induced in the fat body and

77

tracheal system of dlg mutant tumour bearing larvae. We find Defensin

78

consistently associated to dying tumour cells. Critically, systemic and tissue

79

specific knockdown of Defensin demonstrates a non-redundant role of the

80

AMP in controlling tumour growth through the induction of tumour cell death.

81

Anti-tumoural Defensin production relies on TNF-dependent activation of both

82

Toll and Imd pathway. Our results demonstrate that dlg mutant tumours

83

expose PS in response to haemocyte-derived TNF and that Defensin is

84

present in PS enriched area on the tumour surface. Finally, we find that lack

85

of TNF prevents PS exposure in tumours and makes them insensitive to the

86

action of Defensin. Collectively, our results reveal an anti-tumoural role for

87

Defensin in vivo and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms, which

88

make tumours sensitive to the killing action of an endogenous AMP.

Results

91

dlg tumour bearing larvae express the AMP Defensin

92

In order to assess expression of several AMPs we performed RT-

93

qPCR analysis on fat bodies dissected from wild type controls (w1118) or dlg

94

mutant larvae (Figure 1B). Results showed consistent and statistically

95

significant upregulation of defensin in fat bodies of dlg larvae compared to

96

wild-type ones (Figure 1B). Other Toll-dependent AMPs display a trend to be

97

increased (drosomycin and attacin A), even though data was highly variable

98

amongst biological replicates, while other AMPs were not transcriptionally

99

regulated (drosocyn, cecropin A1) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, human β-

100

Defensin 1 displays anticancer activity in vitro (Bullard et al., 2008; Sun et al.,

101

2006), and deletion of human def appears prevalent in some cancer types (Ye

102

et al., 2018). This prompted us to explore the role of Drosophila Defensin in

103

dlg mutant tumours. Using dlg larvae reared on antibiotics, we confirmed that

104

defensin upregulation was independent of the presence of microbes (Figure

105

1C). Moreover, larvae bearing dlg imaginal discs tumours induced by RNAi

106

(en>UAS-dcr2; UAS-dlg-IR) also displayed increased defensin expression,

107

confirming AMP gene induction as a consequence of dlg-driven epithelial

108

transformation rather than whole body gene loss (Figure 1D). We conclude

109

that Defensin, an AMP known for its activity against microbes, is induced, in a

110

sterile environment, by the presence of tumours.

111
112

Defensin restrains dlg tumour growth and promotes tumour cell death.

113

We next hypothesized that Defensin may be an important mediator of

114

anti-tumour immunity in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we generated null

115

mutant alleles for the defensin (def) gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system

116

(defsk3 and defsk4) (Figure 1E) (Hanson et al., 2018). Survival analysis of defsk3

117

flies confirmed that this AMP contribute to resist systemic infection to certain

118

Gram-positive bacteria (Figure supplement 1) (Levashina et al., 1995). To

119

evaluate the effect of Defensin on tumour development, we combined def and

120

dlg loss of function alleles. Compared to dlg mutant animals, dlg;def double

121

mutants displayed a significant increase in tumour size (Figure 2A). Tumour

122

growth is limited by apoptotic tumour cell death as revealed by Dcp1 staining

123

(Parisi et al., 2014). Interestingly, tumours from dlg;def double mutants display

124

a very strong decrease in apoptosis (Figure 2B-E’), suggesting that increased

125

tumour size in absence of Defensin is due to a decrease in tumour cell death.

126

This was further supported by the similar proliferation rates measured in dlg

127

and dlg,def mutant tumours as per quantification of anti-phophoHistone H3

128

staining (Figure supplement 2A-E’). Importantly, the effect of Def on tumour

129

size and cell death were still observed when dlg and dlg,def larvae were

130

reared in sterile conditions (Figure supplement 2F-J’) and further confirmed

131

upon ubiquitous knock down of def using RNA interference (IR) (Figure 2F-J’).

132

Furthermore, fat body overexpression of def significantly rescued tumour

133

volume and tumour cell death of dlg;defsk3 double mutant animals (Figure 2K

134

and L). Additionally, larval injection of a synthetic Defensin peptide increased

135

tumour cell death of dlg or dlg;defsk3 imaginal discs (Figure 2M), while it had

136

no effect on tissues from wild-type larvae, indicating that Defensin can

137

selectively promote cell death of tumour cells. Altogether, these results

demonstrate

142

Having shown that Defensin restrict tumour growth, we sought to

determine the tissues that produced endogenous Defensin in the context of

144

tumour bearing. Previous studies have shown that Defensin is not produced

145

by imaginal discs or tumours (Bunker et al., 2015; Kulshammer et al., 2015).

146

In the context of infection, Defensin can be produced by the fat body as well

147

the tracheal and gut epithelium (Tzou et al., 2000). We monitored defensin

148

expression by RT-qPCR in various immune tissues of tumour bearing

149

animals. We observed that the fat body, homologue to the mammalian liver

150

and adipose tissue, and the trachea, a network of tubes transporting oxygen

151

to cells that resembles the mammalian vasculature, were the main sources of

152

defensin in these animals (Figure 3A). This was also supported by Defensin

153

immunostaining, (Figure 3B and C). Transcript assessment upon targeted IR

154

knock down of defensin in the respective tissues further confirmed the

155

domains of endogenous gene expression (Figure 3D and I). Importantly,

156

knocking down defensin expression specifically in the fat body or the trachea

157

of dlg animals, resulted in increased tumour size and decreased tumour cell

158

death (Figure 3E-H’ and J-M’) confirming the non-redundant functional

159

requirement of defensin in both tissues to efficiently promote tumour cell

160

death.

161

To investigate the possibility that Defensin produced by the fat body

162

and the trachea can specifically target tumour cells, we made use of an

163

inducible haemagglutinin (HA) tagged form of Defensin (UAS-def-HA). We

164

noticed leaky HA protein expression in the tracheal system (Figure 4A) but not

165

in the fat body (Figure 4B) of animals carrying the UAS-def-HA construct only.

166

Therefore, we overexpressed UAS-def-HA in the fat body using a Gal4

167

specific driver (lpp>def-HA), which resulted in significant upregulation of

168

Defensin in the fat body (Figure 4D) when compared to control conditions

169

(Figure 4B), but also maintained the leaky expression of the transgene in the

170

trachea (Figure 4C). Strikingly, overexpression of UAS-def-HA in the fat body

171

resulted in Defensin-HA immunostaining in transformed imaginal discs from

172

dlg mutant animals (Figure 4E and E’) but not in normal tissues from dlg

173

heterozygous animals (Figure 4F and F’).

174

Consistently, using anti-Defensin antibody, we observed endogenous

175

Defensin staining on dlg mutant tumour (Figure 4G-H’’) but not in the wild-type

176

discs (Figure 4I). Interestingly, we predominantly observed Defensin bound to

177

tumour areas enriched with apoptotic cells (Figure 4H-H’’). High-resolution

178

imaging showed Defensin enrichment at the membrane of these dying cells

179

(Figure 4J-J’’).
Altogether, these results show that Defensin produced by immune

180
181

tissues selectively binds tumour cells to target them for apoptosis.

182
183

Toll and Imd pathway contribute to Defensin expression in dlg mutant

184

larvae

185

defensin expression upon systemic infection relies on both Toll and

186

Imd pathways (Lemaitre et al., 1996; Leulier et al., 2000). While we previously

187

showed that Toll pathway activation in dlg mutant larvae is required to achieve

188

maximal tumour cell death (Parisi et al., 2014), the involvement of the Imd

189

pathway in tumour bearing animals was still elusive. To assess the

190

contribution of the Imd pathway to both defensin expression and tumour

191

burden, we analysed these two phenotypes in larvae deficient for the Imd-

192

pathway. We observed a 55-60% decrease in defensin expression in dlg

193

mutants carrying a loss of function allele affecting imd (dlg;imd1) (Figure 5A)

194

or the gene encoding the downstream transcription factor Relish (dlg;relE20)

195

(Figure 5F). Consistently, analysis of tumour phenotypes revealed increased

196

tumour volume and decreased tumour cell death in dlg;imd1 and dlg;relE20

197

animals when compared with dlg counterparts (Figure 5B-E’ and G-J’).

198

Altogether, these data demonstrate that the Imd pathway is required for

199

defensin upregulation, impairment of tumour growth and induction of tumour

200

cell death in dlg mutant larvae.

201

Upon infection, AMP expression in the trachea exclusively relies on the

202

Imd pathway (Tzou et al., 2000). We therefore looked at defensin expression

203

and tumour phenotype in dlg mutant larvae where imd expression had been

204

knocked down specifically within tracheal cells (dlg;btl>imd-IR). In this setting,

205

defensin expression was significantly reduced in the whole larvae (Figure 6A).

206

Consistently, tumour volume was increased while tumour cell death was

207

decreased (Figure 6B-E’) showing the requirement of Imd pathway in the

208

tracheal system to control tumour burden.

209

In the fat body, both Imd and Toll patways contribute to AMPs

210

expression during infection (Tzou et al., 2002). To evaluate the contribution of

211

Toll and Imd pathways in fat body in tumour bearing larvae, we monitored

212

defensin expression and tumour phenotype in dlg animals in which Toll or Imd

213

pathways have been selectively knocked down in the fat body. Knocking

214

down myd88, which encodes a common adaptor to Toll receptors (Imler and

215

Zheng, 2004), or imd in the fat body resulted in a significant decrease in

216

defensin expression (Figure 6F) and, consistently, increased tumour volume

217

and decreased tumour cell death (Figure 6G-K’). Moreover, concomitant

218

overexpression of defensin and Myd88-IR or Imd-IR in the fat body of dlg

219

larvae was sufficient to significantly rescue the tumour volume and tumour cell

220

death phenotypes resulting from fat body knockdown of Myd88 or Imd in dlg

221

animals (Figure 6L-O).

222

We conclude that, in dlg mutant animals, Toll and Imd pathways have

223

non-redundant roles in restricting tumour growth and promoting tumour cell

224

death through the control of defensin expression. Importantly, forced Defensin

225

expression in an otherwise immune-compromised animal is sufficient to

226

reduce tumour growth and to promote tumour cell death.

227
228

Defensin is enriched in tumour areas exposing phosphatidylserine

229

AMPs targeting of pathogens, involves the recognition of negatively

230

charged molecules exposed on the cell surface (Yeaman and Yount, 2003). A

231

key question raised by our study is how Defensin can selectively bind and kill

232

tumour cells (Figure 4 and Figure 2M). Selective action of cationic AMP is

233

attributed to their ability to interact with negative charged membrane such as

234

those found in bacteria. We hypothesized that the membrane of tumour cells

235

from dlg mutant larvae might change their electrostatic properties, making

236

them sensitive to the action of Defensin. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a

237

negatively charged phospholipid, normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the

238

cell membrane. However, PS can be exposed on the outer leaflet for example

239

in apoptotic cells, which tags these cells for phagocytosis (Birge et al., 2016;

240

Shklyar et al., 2013; Tung et al., 2013). Moreover, PS exposure has been

241

shown to occur independently of apoptosis in many cancer cell types (Riedl et

242

al., 2011). Therefore, we investigated whether PS externalisation could be a

243

factor allowing specific targeting of tumour cells by Defensin. Our data

244

revealed that dlg but not wild-type tissues, displayed high levels of Annexin V

245

staining (Figure 7A and B), indicating increased exposure of PS by dlg

246

tumours. We next looked at the ability of Defensin to specifically associate

247

with tumour cells exposing PS and found that Defensin localized in PS-

248

enriched areas on dlg tumours (Figure 7A-A’’). Thus, Defensin produced by

10

249

immune responsive tissues binds specifically to tumour cells and this ability

250

correlated with the exposure of PS.

251
252

The TNF homolog Eiger is required for PS exposure and Defensin anti-

253

tumoural activity.

254

Previous studies have shown that circulating macrophage-like cells in

255

Drosophila, called haemocytes, bind to dlg mutant tumours and contribute to

256

cell death (Parisi et al., 2014). This process is mediated by the release of

257

Eiger from haemocytes (Cordero et al., 2010; Parisi et al., 2014), which then

258

activates the JNK pathway in target cells to promote apoptosis (Igaki et al.,

259

2009). Moreover, Toll pathway activation in tumour bearing animals also

260

requires Eiger (Parisi et al., 2014). Accordingly, we found that defensin

261

upregulation observed in dlg animals was lost in dlg;egr3 double mutants

262

(Figure 7C). We next tested whether PS exposure in tumours was dependent

263

on Eiger, and observed an almost complete loss of cell-surface PS in dlg;egr3

264

tumours (Figure 7A, D and E). Therefore, Eiger is required for PS exposure in

265

these tumours. We then analysed PS exposure in dlg mutant tumours, upon

266

specific eiger knockdown in haemocytes (dlg;hml>egr-IR), and observed a

267

strong decrease in cell surface-exposed PS compared to control tumours

268

(dlg;hml>ctrl-IR) (Figure 7F-H). This indicates that PS exposure in tumour

269

cells is likely triggered by the release of Eiger from haemocytes.

270

Importantly, Egr-dependent signalling and PS exposure were intact in dlg;def

271

and dlg;imd mutants (Figure 7I-L and Figure supplement 3). This indicates

272

that Eiger signalling and PS exposure precedes the action of Defensin in dlg

273

tumours. To further assess whether Eiger was required for Defensin-induced

274

tumour cell death, we injected synthetic Defensin peptide into control, dlg or

275

dlg;egr3 mutant larvae. As expected, Defensin injection was able to robustly

276

promote tumour cell death in dlg mutant tumours (Figure 7M). However,

277

Defensin was unable to affect tumours derived from Eiger -deficient animals,

278

demonstrating the requirement of Eiger for tumour cell death induced by

279

Defensin (Figure 7M).

280
281

Discussion

282

While the role of antimicrobial peptides in innate immune defense has been

283

well-recognized for decades (Bahar and Ren, 2013), recent reports revealed

284

potential additional physiological functions of AMPs, including aging and

285

neurodegeneration (Cao et al., 2014; Kounatidis et al., 2017; Lezi et al.,

286

2018), wound-healing (Chung et al., 2017; Tokumaru et al., 2005), resistance

287

to oxidative stress (Mergaert et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2011), immune signaling

288

(Tjabringa et al., 2003; van Wetering et al., 2002) and anti-cancer activity

289

(Deslouches and Di, 2017). However, due to the absence of AMP mutants,

290

most of these studies have relied on the use of exogenous sources of AMPs

291

or genetic modification of upstream regulators of AMP expression. Recently,

292

the use of loss of function alleles of Drosophila Diptericin (DptB), allowed to

293

establish a role for the AMP in long-term memory (Barajas-Azpeleta et al.,

294

2018). Pioneer work reporting systematic deletion of multiple AMPs in

295

Drosophila, opens the door for in-depth analysis of the endogenous functions

296

of these molecules (Hanson et al., 2018). Using such tools and a genetically

297

defined in vivo tumour model, our study demonstrates a role for Defensin in

298

the control of tumours and deciphers the molecular mechanism allowing

299

specific tumour cell targeting by the AMP. Collectively, our results suggest a

300

model of tumour control in two steps: Firstly, the cellular immune response to

301

tumours involves the binding of haemocytes to tumour cells and activation of

302

TNF pathway leading to PS exposure (Figure 7N). This is followed by a

303

humoral response achieved by the action of antimicrobial peptides remotely

304

produced by the fat body and the trachea (Figure 7N). Thus, the two branches

305

of Drosophila innate immunity contribute to tumour elimination.

306
307

A role for a Drosophila AMP in tumour control

308

Using mutants as well as ubiquitous or targeted knockdowns, our study

309

reveals that Defensin is non-redundantly required to drive tumour cell death

310

and restrict tumour growth in neoplastic tumours generated by loss the apico-

311

basal determinant Dlg. This was reinforced by detection of Defensin on dying

312

tumour cells as well as genetic rescue and injection experiments showing that

313

Defensin can actively drive tumour cell death. Several in vitro studies in

314

mammals have pointed to AMPs anti-tumoural potential (Deslouches and Di,

315

2017). Amongst these suggested anticancer peptides, Human β-Defensin 1

316

(hBD1) appears downregulated in 82% of prostate cancer and 90% of renal

317

clear cell carcinomas (Donald et al., 2003). Furthermore, expression of hBD1

318

induces cell death in prostate and renal cancer cells in vitro (Bullard et al.,

319

2008; Sun et al., 2006). Moreover, a recent report shows prevalent deletion of

320

Human defensin gene cluster in some tumour types including prostate, lung

321

and colorectal cancers, as well as a decrease overall survival in patients

322

carrying these deletions (Ye et al., 2018). However, since the classification of

323

a molecule as AMP is based on structural protein features, it is important to

324

mention that Human Defensins are not homologous of, but rather have

325

structural resemblances, to Drosophila AMPs due to convergent evolution

326

(Shafee et al., 2017). Further studies are required to determine if anticancer

327

activity displayed by Defensins from different species is linked to their

328

structural properties.

329

As upon infection (Tzou et al., 2000), we show that the fat body and the

330

trachea are the main sources of Defensin in tumours bearing larvae.

331

Moreover, our results indicated that Defensin’s maximal expression, and anti-

332

tumour properties rely on Imd and Toll pathways activation. As expected from

333

previous studies on anti-pathogenic immunity, Imd appears to play a critical

334

role in the tracheal system, while both Imd and Toll drive Defensin expression

335

in the fat body (Hoffmann and Reichhart, 2002; Tzou et al., 2002).

336

Consistently, overexpressing Defensin partially rescued the effect of Imd or

337

Toll knockdown on dlg tumours. However, Toll and Imd pathways are major

338

regulators of multiple AMPs in the Drosophila fat body. Then, it is conceivable

339

that AMPs other than Defensin may possess similar anti-tumoural activity. In

340

fact, a recent study in Drosophila shows that ectopic expression of several

341

antimicrobial peptides, including the Defensin, can increase cell death in a

342

haematopoietic tumour model (Araki et al., 2018). Authors of that study also

343

reported activation of Toll and Imd pathways together with increased

344

expression of several AMPs in those tumour bearing animals. Together with

345

our study, this suggests potentially general anti-tumoural properties of

346

Drosophila AMPs.

348

Defensin specifically targets tumour cells

349

Importantly, we show that Defensin targets tumour cells for apoptosis

350

while sparing normal cells. As their human counterparts, we show that

351

Drosophila tumours can expose PS independently of cell death (Riedl et al.,

352

2011). Interestingly, an in vitro study showed selective anticancer activity of

353

some synthetic peptides derived from beetle Defensin, against cancer cells

354

exposing PS (Iwasaki et al., 2009). A similar targeting mechanism has also

355

been proposed to explain temporin-1CEa or L-K6 anticancer activities towards

356

melanoma cells and breast cancer cells respectively (Wang et al., 2016;

357

Wang et al., 2017). PS is a mark of apoptotic cells, which is used as an “eat

358

me” signal by phagocytes (Shklyar et al., 2013; Tung et al., 2013). In

359

Drosophila, the phagocytic receptor Simu together with Draper contribute to

360

the elimination of apoptotic to the recognition of PS (Shklyar et al., 2013; Tung

361

et al., 2013). It would be interesting to test the role of these receptors in the

362

control of dlg tumour progression.

363

Our results indicate that PS exposure precedes Defensin action and is

364

not just an “eat-me” signal but likely contributes to changing the membrane of

365

tumour cells making them sensitive to the action of AMPs. It is tempting to

366

speculate that deleterious effect of AMPs observed upon aging or

367

neurodegeneration may involve a similar targeting mechanism of ‘foreign-

368

looking’ or unfit cells (Cao et al., 2013; Kounatidis et al., 2017; Lezi et al.,

369

2018).

370

Noteworthy, other negatively charged molecules enriched on tumour

371

surface such as heparan sulfates and O-glycosylated mucins may also

372

contribute to the targeting by AMPs (Hollingsworth and Swanson, 2004;

373

Knelson et al., 2014).

374
375

Defensin action requires TNF

376

TNF is a major player in the tumour microenvironment by exerting

377

pleiotropic effects on both the tumour and its surroundings (Ham et al., 2016;

378

Parameswaran and Patial, 2010). In our dlg mutant model, we observed that

379

defensin induction requires TNF, supporting previous observations that

380

induction of innate immune response in tumour bearing animal relied on Eiger

381

produced by the tumour (Parisi et al., 2014). Indeed, Toll activation in the fat

382

body has been proposed to be a consequence of tumour-derived TNF, which

383

drives haemocyte proliferation leading to an increase in Toll ligand Spatzle

384

(Parisi et al., 2014). Whether Imd pathway is also indirectly activated by the

385

changes in immune cell activity in response to tumour or by alternative

386

mechanisms remains an open question.

387

Our results show that haemocyte-derived TNF is required for PS

388

exposure by the tumour, a key process for tumour targeting by Defensin.

389

Consistently, haemocyte-derived TNF is shown to drive cell death in dlg

390

mutant tumours (Parisi et al., 2014). The precise molecular mechanisms

391

driving PS exposure downstream of TNF remain unknown. However,

392

haemocyte-derived TNF, activates JNK pathway, which triggers many

393

changes in tumour cells including apoptosis (Igaki et al., 2002; Moreno et al.,

394

2002), ROS production (Fogarty et al., 2016; Santabarbara-Ruiz et al., 2015),

395

loss of cell polarity (Zhu et al., 2010), modification of extracellular matrix

396

(Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006), proliferation and cell migration (Beaucher et

397

al., 2007; Igaki et al., 2006; Pastor-Pareja et al., 2004; Srivastava et al.,

398

2007). Thus, TNF might also sensitize cells through activation of the JNK

16

399

pathway (Cordero et al., 2010) providing, in addition to PS exposure, a

400

secondary sensitization mechanism of tumour cells to the action of the AMP.

401

Further studies are needed to explore a potential link between JNK activation

402

and PS exposure since pleiotropic effects of JNK may drive PS exposure

403

downstream of TNF.

404

Another consequence of TNF-dependent JNK activation in tumours is

405

the increased expression of matrix metalloproteases (Mmps) by tumour cells

406

(Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006). Importantly, we show that Mmp-1 induction

407

and then JNK pathway activation are still present in tumour from larvae

408

devoided of Defensin. This demonstrates that TNF signalling acts upstream of

409

Defensin. Mmps degrade the basal membrane facilitating metastasis of

410

primary tumour cells (Beaucher et al., 2007; Pastor-Pareja et al., 2004;

411

Srivastava et al., 2007). Interestingly, a study reported that human Mmp-7 can

412

cleave immature Defensins, promoting their activation (Wilson et al., 1999;

413

Wilson et al., 2009). Indeed, the pro-domain present in AMPs is thought to

414

keep their in vivo activity silent, allowing local activation of AMP upon

415

cleavage. While the mechanisms of Drosophila Defensin pro-domain

416

cleavage remain unknown, it would be interesting to explore whether the

417

changes in the tumour microenvironment could also affect Defensin

418

activation.

419
420

In conclusion, our study provides the first direct in vivo demonstration of the

421

role of an endogenous AMP as an anti-cancer agent in Drosophila. Our data

422

points to a conserved mechanism of tumour control by AMPs, a potent arm of

423

the innate immune system. Importantly, we identify cellular features within

424

tumours, which may be predictive of their sensitivity to be targeted by AMPs.

425

This study provides a new paradigm to decipher the molecular mechanisms

426

influencing anti-tumoural functions of an AMP, which may extend to other

427

non-canonical roles of AMPs, such as in ageing, long-term memory and

428

wound healing. Moreover, together with the new genetic tools allowing

429

targeting of all Drosophila AMPs (Hanson et al., 2018), our study establishes

430

new bases to explore in vivo a potential important natural mechanism of

431

defence against tumours.

Material and Methods

434

Drosophila housekeeping and rearing

435

Flies were reared at 25°C under 12h/12h light/dark cycles on standard

436

oatmeal and molasses medium (Fernandez-Ayala et al., 2009). Details on fly

437

strains used in this study are presented in Table supplement 1 and detailed

438

genotypes are included in corresponding figure legends.

439

For assessment of tumour volume and tumour cell death, flies were

440

transferred to medium embryo collection cages and allowed to lay eggs for 8h

441

at room temperature (RT) on agar/grape juice plates (2.1% agar, 25% grape

442

juice, 1.25% sucrose, 0.2% methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) supplemented with

443

yeast paste. Plates were kept at 25°C until hatching. 200 larvae hatched

444

within a 4h time window were collected and transferred to rearing bottles

445

containing 45mL of fly food to avoid any developmental delay and/or

446

starvation effects due to overcrowding conditions. The tumour phenotype was

447

analysed close to the normal developmental time, i.e. 7 days after hatching.

448

Tumours were dissected and stained for further analysis (see below).

450

Generation of defensin mutants

451

defsk3 and defsk4 mutants were generated using CRISPR/cas9

452

technology (Hanson et al., 2018). Mutants were isogenized through

453

backcrosses with a w1118 iso line as previously described in Ferreiera-Teixeira

454

et al, 2014.

455
456

Survival assays

457

Survival of defSK3 animals was compared to wild type controls

458

(isogenised background, iso). Male flies (5-7 days old) were pricked in the

459

thorax with a needle dipped in a concentrated pellet of fresh overnight

460

bacterial culture. Infected flies were kept at 29°C. Listeria innocua was

461

cultured in Brain heart infusion medium at 37°C and used at optical density of

462

200nm (OD600). Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15 was cultured in Luria-

463

Bertani broth at 29°C and used at OD600 200. Experiments were repeated

464

three times independently and one representative experiment is shown.

Immunohistochemistry

468

Tissues were dissected in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) and fixed for

469

20min in 4% formaldehyde. Fat body samples were fixed for 30min using the

470

same protocol. Tissues were washed three times in PBS containing 1% of

471

Triton-X100 (PBT) and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies.

472

Tissues were washed 5 times in PBT and incubated for 2h at RT with

Sterile rearing conditions

505

To rule out any effect of infection on the tumour phenotypes,

506

Drosophila larvae were reared on standard food supplemented with penicillin

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The same amount of total RNA (1µg for whole

517

larvae and fat body or 100ng for trachea) was used to perform the three

518

independent reverse-transcriptions using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse

525

was used to normalize expression levels of target genes. Data was analysed

526

using the Ct method (2-∆∆ct). All qPCR experiments were carried out on three

to seven independent biological replicates (see figure legends for details) and,

528

larvae were sampled from the same bottle used to analyse the tumour

phenotype. GraphPad Prism7 software was used for graphical representation

530

and statistical analysis. Primer targets and sequences are presented in Table

PCR amplification of genomic DNA

534

To verify the sequence of defsk3 and defsk4 mutants, genomic DNA was

535

extracted from single flies by grinding whole animals with a 200µL pipette tip

536

containing 50µL of squishing buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 1mM EDTA,

537

25mM NaCl, 200µg proteinase K) followed by incubation at 37°C for 30min.

538

Proteinase K was heat-inactivated at 95°C for 2min. 1µL of genomic DNA was

20min. Immunostaining, mounting and imaging were then carried out as

549

described above.

550

We used Fiji 2.0.0 software to quantify Annexin V staining at the

551

tumour surface. Maximal Z-projection of whole tumours were generated and

552

the Colour Threshold tool was then used to detect the red pixels that

553

represented Annexin V staining at the surface of tumours. The hue slider was

554

set to include only the red signal, and the brightness slider was adjusted to

555

exclude any background signal. This area was then selected and measured in
