Abstract

34

Earthworms (Annelida: Crassiclitellata), are widely distributed around the world due to

35

their great adaptability. However, lack of a high-quality genome sequence prevents

36

gaining the many insights into physiology, phylogeny, and genome evolution that could

37

come from a good earthworm genome. Herein, we report a complete genome assembly

38

of the earthworm Amynthas corticis of about 1.2 Gb, based on a strategy combining

39

third-generation long-read sequencing and Hi-C mapping. A total of 29,256 protein-

40

coding genes are annotated in this genome. Analysis of resequencing data indicates that

41

this earthworm is a triploid species. Furthermore, gene family evolution analysis shows

42

that comprehensive expansion of gene families in the earthworm genome has produced

43

more defensive functions compared with other species in Annelida. Quantitative

44

proteomic iTRAQ analysis shows 97 immune related proteins and 16S rDNA

45

sequences shows 88 microbes with significantly response to pathogenic Escherichia

46

coli O157:H7. Our genome assembly provides abundant and valuable resources for the

47

earthworm research community, serving as a first step toward uncovering the mysteries

48

of this species, may explain its powerful defensive functions adapt to complex

49

environment and invasion from molecular level.

Introduction

52

The earthworm belongs to oligochaete annelid distributed all over the world. Recently,

53

a research focus on diversity of earthworm at the global scale showed that this

54

underground species has more local richness and abundance in temperate zone, but

55

more dissimilarity across different locations in tropical zone1. More interestingly, it also

56

showed that climate is the key factor affecting distribution of earthworm, in spite of the

57

soil property and habitat cover through modeling based on integrated big data1. Soil

58

properties and habitat covers represent diverse environments, which means different

59

threats and dangers to species, especially for underground ones. Thus, it could be

60

proposed that there must be unique and robust molecular mechanisms in individual

61

earthworm helping it face to and live in adverse and complex environments.

62
63

Earthworm has been recognized as the species with profound ecological and economic

64

impacts on soil2,3 and considered as the “soil engineer”. On the other hand, earthworm

65

is also an invasive species with not ignorable affections on soil ecosystem4-6, including

66

local diversity of native species7. Behind the invasive characteristic, a close association

67

between polyploidy and parthenogenetic reproduction has been identified in earthworm

68

species of Lumbricidae family8-11. Polyploidy of earthworm provides more genomic

69

materials for evolving novel phenotypes, while parthenogenetic reproduction ensures

70

the fixation of them, which is benefit for its rapid adaptation to a new environment.

71
72

Amynthas corticis, an earthworm species of Megascolecidae family, which is a wild

73

species with global distribution. Particularly, A. corticis is also a cosmopolitan invasive

74

species originating from Asian. There was a study suggested that the invasive ability of

75

A. corticis is due to its greater mobility and polyploidy or parthenogenetic

76

reproduction12. To reveal the whole picture of molecular mechanisms behind the

77

strongly adaptive ability of A. corticis, we sequenced its genome and generated a

78

complete assembly with a length of 1.29 Gb in total, including 42 chromosome-level

79

scaffolds with N50 length of 31 Mb (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition to

80

the genome, we also detected protein mass spectrum for the body of earthworm and

81

sequenced 16S rDNA for the intestinal tract of earthworm under the treatment of a

82

pathogenic Escherichia coli stress O157:H713, which mimics the severely adverse

83

environmental factor, to profile how earthworm genome functions when facing to

84

stresses.

85
86

Results

87

A. corticis is triploid

88

Based on the data resequenced from two individual earthworms of A. corticis, we called

89

genome wide SNPs and constructed the coverage distribution of heterozygous k-mers.

90

Following that, we evaluated the ploidy of the genome of A. corticis. First of all, the

91

frequency distribution of SNPs at biallelic loci showed that there were two peaks near
3

92

the frequency of 1/3 and 2/3 appeared (Fig. 1d), suggesting most of biallelic loci have

93

three copies in the genome of A. corticis. In addition, the result of statistical analysis

94

based on the frequency distribution of genome wide SNPs showed the feature of

95

triploidy possesses the lowest delta log-likelihood (Fig. 1c), suggesting the genome of

96

A. corticis is triploid with the largest probability. Furthermore, the coverage distribution

97

related to 88% of heterozygous k-mers concentrated at 3n for the total coverage of k-

98

mer pairs and 1/3 for the normalized coverage of minor k-mers (Fig. 1e), implying the

99

triploid feature of the genome of A. corticis. Lastly, karyotype analysis of four

100

earthworms showed that chromosome number of each individual was larger than 120

101

(Fig. 1a-b). In combination with that we have assembled 42 chromosome-level

102

scaffolds, the large number of chromosomes also implied the triploid feature of A.

103

cortices genome. Thus, multiple independent proofs supported the genome of A.

104

corticis is triploid.

105
106

Abundant gene contents related to defensive

107

Compared with other two annelids, Capitella teleta and Helobdella robusta14, the

108

genome size of earthworm A. corticis is significantly larger than them with 3.87 and

109

5.49 folds, respectively. This phenomenon suggests that there should be comprehensive

110

expansion of gene families happened in earthworm genome. To make it clear, we

111

constructed orthologous groups for genes in earthworm and other invertebrate lineages,

112

including annelids, mollusc, flatworms, roundworms and vertebrates based on TreeFam

113

database15,16.

114
115

To reveal the evolutionary relationship of earthworm and other species, we construct

116

the phylogenetic tree covering all of species mentioned above based on single-copy

117

orthologous groups. As is shown in Figure 2a, the constructed tree revealed

118

evolutionary relationship of all species consistent with the common sense. However,

119

when focusing on orthologous groups with significantly evolutionary rate, the

120

Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient matrix of group size of different species shows

121

earthworm was away from its phylogenetic tree neighbor of annelids and mollusc, but

122

close to flatworms, roundworms and two snakes in vertebrates (Fig. 2b). These

123

contradictory phenomena imply that environmental or other factors had affected the

124

evolutionary path of earthworm away from other annelids, resulting in a unique annelid

125

genome.

126
127

Detailed analysis of orthologous groups with significantly rapid evolutionary rate

128

showed that more than 70% of them in earthworm are expanded compared with the

129

most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of annelids, which is consistent with its large

130

genome size. Furthermore, the principle component analysis (PCA) using group size of

131

different species also showed that earthworm is away from other annelids along the first

132

principle component (Fig. 2c). What is more interesting, earthworm diverged away

133

from other annelids with a stepwise manner. At each step, species of flatworms,

134

roundworms or vertebrates appeared. For convenience, we defined five steps along the

135

divergence, which are represented by Echinococcus multilocularis, Ascaris

136

lumbricoides, Ophiophagus Hannah, Schmidtea mediterranea and itself. Then we

137

extracted orthologous groups with the size in earthworm, which is larger than it in

138

annelids and mollusc while smaller than or equal to it in representative species of each

139

step, as expanded gene families of earthworm at this step. The result of functional

140

enrichment analysis17,18 showed that there were the most enriched expanded functions

141

at the last step. Besides fundamental functions such as anatomical structure

142

development, signal transduction, cell differentiation and transport, many functions

143

related to immune system process, response to stress and homeostatic process expanded

144

(Fig. 2d). It could be suggested that the evolutionary process at the last step ensures

145

abundant gene contents related to defensive in the genome of A. corticis and thus equips

146

earthworm with large number of molecular arms and effective strategies to live in

147

hostile environments. Furthermore, we reconstructed the evolutionary path of functions

148

related to immune system process, response to stress and homeostatic process through

149

plotting odds ratio at each step for significantly enriched ones (Supplementary Fig. 2-

150

4).

152

Defensive to pathogenic E. coli O157:H7

153

We fed earthworm with pathogenic E. coli O157:H713, which mimics the severely

154

adverse environmental factor, and then detected protein mass spectrum for the body of

155

earthworm and sequenced 16S rDNA for the intestinal tract of earthworm. To profile

156

the dynamic pattern of expression and intestinal microorganism constitution, we

157

selected samples at several time points after treatment of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7

158

to detect protein mass spectrum while sequence 16S rDNA. Following normalization

159

of expression level and 16S rDNA abundance, we conducted analysis of variance

160

(ANOVA) for both of them.

161
162

In terms of protein mass spectrum, we found 23 genes expressed with significant

163

variation among samples (Fig. 3). First of all, none of these 23 genes expressed in

164

control samples, indicating their specific roles in response to stresses. Furthermore,

165

these genes could be classified as two categories according to whether expressed on the

166

immediate 3rd day after feed of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7. Genes expressed on the

167

7th day or both of the 7th and 28th days but not in the 3rd day were classified as the first

168

category, while genes expressed on the 3rd day were classified as the second category.

169

There are 6 genes belonging to the first category, representing the pattern of later

170

regulation to resist pathogenic bacteria. Two of these genes contained abhydrolase

171

domain or F-BAR domain, while others were novel ones appeared in earthworm

172

without any reliable functional counterparts in otherwise species. The left 17 genes

173

belong to the second category, representing a pattern that immediate activation followed

174

by subtle regulation. Genes classified as the second category include heat shock 70kDa

175

proteins, M1 metallopeptidases, and SRCAP complex, which expressed not only on the

176

3rd day but on either the 7th or 28th day.

177
178

For 16S rDNA, we found the abundance of 9 kinds of microorganisms varied

179

significantly among samples (Fig. 4). The dynamic changing patterns of abundance of

180

these 9 kinds of microorganisms could be classified as 2 categories, including down-up

181

trend and novel appearance on the 28th day. The pattern of down-up trend revealed the

182

reconstruction process of native microorganisms in the intestinal track of earthworm,

183

which could be considered as an indicator representing defensive effects to the

184

pathogenic bacteria. In particular, soil microorganisms belong to class Acidobacteria-

185

619 or order Ellin606720 reached the highest abundance on the 28th day compared with

186

others, revealing the active uptake of earthworm to resist biotic stresses.

187

Microorganisms with novel appearance on the 28th day, including drilosphere

188

microorganisms belong to family AKIW87421, also revealed the active uptake of

189

earthworm helping to survive under stresses.

190
191

Profile of defensive genes in earthworm genome

192

Great adaptation and strong vitality of earthworm have always attracted attentions of

193

biologists and ecologists to make it clear. Thus, several well determined defensive

194

genes were cloned and studied in detail22-37. However, due to the absence of a complete

195

genome, it is failed to construct an overview on defensive systems of earthworm. Here,

196

we systematically profiled copies of defensive genes with reliable evidence in

197

earthworm from the assembled complete genome. Predicted genes were considered as

198

orthologs of well determined defensive genes if there were reciprocally best hits

199

between them, which were listed in Supplementary Table 1. Then, we analyzed

200

genomic location and expression pattern for orthologous group members of defensive

201

genes (Fig. 5).

202
203

Discussion

204

Profiling of molecule mechanisms behind defensive of earthworm help to better

205

understand the global distribution of this species and the origin of sophisticated

206

immunity in vertebrates. In addition, it can also facilitate the usage of earthworm as an

207

animal model in comparative immunology studies and ecotoxicology. Except for its

208

value in research communities, earthworm is useful in monitoring environmental

209

pollutions, and furthermore, is considered as an abundant source of biological active

210

compounds with potential usage in industrial or medical fields.
