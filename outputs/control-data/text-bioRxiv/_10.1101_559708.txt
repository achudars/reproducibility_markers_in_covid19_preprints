Abstract
Accurate anatomical localisation of specific white matter tracts and the quantification of their tract-specific microstructural damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) can contribute to a better understanding of symptomatology, disease
progression and intervention effects. Diffusion MRI-based tractography is being used increasingly to segment white
matter tracts as regions-of-interest for subsequent quantitative analysis. Since MS lesions can interrupt the tractography algorithms tract reconstruction, clinical studies frequently resort to atlas-based approaches, which are convenient
but ignorant to individual variability in tract size and shape. Here, we revisit the problem of individual tractography
in MS, comparing tractography algorithms using: (i) The diffusion tensor framework; (ii) constrained spherical deconvoution (CSD); and (iii) damped Richardson-Lucy (dRL) deconvolution. Firstly, using simulated and in vivo data
from 29 MS patients and 19 healthy controls, we show that the three tracking algorithms respond differentially to MS
pathology. While the tensor-based approach is unable to deal with crossing fibres, CSD produces spurious streamlines, in particular in tissue with high fibre loss and low diffusion anisotropy. With dRL, streamlines are increasingly
interrupted in pathological tissue. Secondly, we demonstrate that despite the effects of lesion on the fibre orientation
reconstruction algorithms, fibre tracking algorithms are still able to segment tracts that pass areas with high prevalence of lesions. Combining dRL-based tractography with an automated tract segmentation tool on data from 131 MS
patients, the cortico-spinal tracts and arcuate fasciculi were successfully reconstructed in more than 90% of individuals. Comparing tract-specific microstructural parameters (fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity and magnetisation
transfer ratio) in individually segmented tracts to those from a tract probability map, we showed that there is no systematic disease-related bias in the individually reconstructed tracts, suggesting that lesions and otherwise damaged
parts are not systematically omitted during tractography. Thirdly, we demonstrate modest anatomical correspondence
between the individual and tract probability-based approach, with a spatial overlap between 35 and 55%. Correlations
between tract-averaged microstructural parameters in individually segmented tracts and the probability-map approach
ranged between r = .52 (p < .001) for radial diffusivity in the right cortico-spinal tract and r = .97 (p < .001)
for magnetization transfer ratio in the arcuate fasciculi. Our results show that MS white matter lesions impact fibre
orientation reconstructions but this does not appear to hinder the ability to anatomically localise white matter tracts in
MS. Individual tract segmentation in MS is feasible on a large scale and could prove a powerful tool for investigating
diagnostic and prognostic markers.

1. Introduction

as a criterion for streamline termination. As FA is significantly decreased in white matter lesions in MS (Filippi
et al., 2001), applying tractography to data from MS patient has been recognized as being problematic (Ciccarelli
et al., 2008; Inglese and Bester, 2010). In the absence of
a strategy to the problem of streamline termination (such
as employed by Lagana et al. (2011), Tench et al. (2002)
and Wang et al. (2018)), the reconstructed tracts may lack
anatomical accuracy, e.g. by premature termination of
tracking (Ozturk et al., 2010). For this reason few studies apply tractography in patients (other examples are Lin
et al. (2005); Reich et al. (2007, 2010)).
More recent advances in tractography algorithms do
not rely on the estimated fibre orientation from the diffusion tensor (which yields one fibre orientation estimate
per voxel), but employ deconvolution approaches that
yield multiple fibre orientations per voxel (e.g. Tournier
et al. (2004)). This advanced approach could permit the
reconstruction of streamlines through MS lesions, given
that enough fibres are present to generate a peak in the
estimated fibre orientation distribution (FOD). However,
it is possible that due to the fibre loss in lesions, the peak
amplitudes may fall below the threshold normally used
for termination of tracking. On the other hand, lowering the FOD amplitude threshold could lead to the tract
reconstruction following spurious peaks, such as those
arising from noise, since lesions are characterised by an
increased component of water with isotropic diffusion,
which can compromise orientation estimates (Dell’Acqua
et al., 2010). To our knowledge, tractography results obtained with spherical deconvolution approaches in MS patients have not been systematically assessed.
Due to the challenges related to tractography in pathological tissue, an alternative approach for obtaining tractspecific measures in MS was suggested (Pagani et al.,
2005; Hua et al., 2008). First, tracts are reconstructed in
the native space of brains of healthy volunteers and then
normalised to a common reference space, where a tractprobability map is created. Then, the data from patients
are aligned with the same common reference space. To
get a tract-specific measure of damage, the probabilistic
atlas is used to calculate a weighted average for the microstructural metric of interest.
While the probability-map based method has the advantage that individual tracts are only reconstructed in
healthy brains, there are also considerable short-comings.

Accurate quantification of white matter damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) is important for characterising disease
pathophysiology (Barkhof et al., 2009). While the hallmark of pathology in MS is focal demyelinating lesions,
correlations between the total volume of lesional tissue
and disability are low, presenting the so-called clinicalradiological paradox (Barkhof, 1999, 2002). Disability
and prognosis may be better explained by the anatomical
location of lesions and of diffuse microstructural damage
outside of lesions (Charil et al., 2003; Kolind et al., 2012).
Accurate assignment of damage to specific anatomical
white matter tracts can provide a more accurate picture
of the disease (Lin et al., 2005), and is important for longitudinal studies that explore the effect of rehabilitation
and experimental interventions on white matter in relevant tracts (Bonzano et al., 2014).
Anatomical localisation of white matter tracts in vivo
currently relies on diffusion-weighted MRI and fibre
tracking (Catani et al., 2002; Jeurissen and Leemans,
2017). The reconstruction of individual tracts is based
on combining prior anatomical knowledge of the tract location with diffusion MRI-based evidence about fibre orientations in the imaging voxels. Early tractography work
was performed by producing streamlines that follow the
principal eigenvector of the diffusion tensor (e.g. Basser
et al. (2000); Mori et al. (1999)), while more recent work
relies on the estimation of the fibre orientation distribution function (e.g. Tournier et al. (2004)). Tractography can be combined with an extraction of tract-specific
microstructural metrics (Jones et al., 2005, 2006) to be
used for investigating individual differences or longitudinal changes in tract-specific microstructure (e.g. Lin et al.
(2005); Metzler-Baddeley et al. (2011)).
Focal brain pathology, such as is present in MS, can
affect tractography. MS lesions are characterised by fibre loss and consequent increase in extracellular water associated with tissue destruction, which is reflected in the
diffusion profile (Filippi et al., 2001). During tractography, at each step of streamline reconstruction, angle and
amplitude criteria are in place to avoid spurious tracking.
Early tractography studies used fractional anisotropy (FA)

The approach relies on inter-subject co-registration of
the images by normalising them to a common reference
space. This normalisation is generally performed based
on structural images, e.g. T1-weighted images, on which
white matter appears homogeneous (Hua et al., 2008; Pagani et al., 2005; Reich et al., 2010). The approach therefore implicitly assumes that white matter tract anatomy is
consistent across individuals and in states of health and
disease. However, this assumption is unlikely to hold.
Tract location and shape vary even between healthy individuals (Wassermann et al., 2012), and in MS white matter atrophy is well described (Ge et al., 2001) and could
affect some tracts more than others (Kezele et al., 2008).
Applying a probability mask may yield measures of microstructural damage that are likely to include information
from other tracts in the vicinity and may therefore not be
anatomically precise. This imprecision could be the explanation for the low correlations between individual tractography and probability-based measures that have previously been reported for some tracts (Reich et al., 2010).
Another explanation could be that the individual tractography omits damaged parts of the tract, leading to notrepresentative and biased estimates.
In this work, we reassess the feasibility of performing
individual tractography in patients. Using simulations as
well as in vivo data sets from patients, we compared the
effect of MS pathology on the performance of three tractography algorithms: (i) DTI based tracking; (ii) Constrained spherical harmonic deconvolution (CSD)-based
tracking and (iii) damped Richardson-Lucy-based tracking. Then, we reconstruct cortico-spinal tracts (CST)
and arcuate fasciculi (Arc) in a large number of patients
to evaluate the practical implications of tracking through
white matter regions with a high prevalence of lesions.

for a number of tissue substrates, all characterised by impermeable parallel cylinders with mean radius of 1 µm
and standard deviation of 0.7 µm. To assess the effect of
fibre loss and increased extracellular volume fraction, as
seen in lesion pathology, we simulated substrates that differed in their intracellular volume fractions, by varying
the number of cylinders placed in the substrate. We simulated substrates with a single fibre population and substrates with two fibre populations crossing at 90 degrees.
Details on the implementation of the simulations are reported in Supplementary Section 1.1.1.
2.1.2. Participants
In total, data from 135 right-handed MS patients, who
took part in a large-scale imaging project (Lipp et al.,
2017), contributed to this study. Diffusion data were available for 131 patients. A subset (29 patients) of the large
cohort had been age- and gender- matched to 19 healthy
controls, who underwent the same scanning protocol. For
all analyses, for which pathological tissue was compared
to healthy control tissue, only data from the two matched
groups were considered. For analyses regarding in vivo
tract segmentation, data from all 131 patients were considered. Data from the healthy controls were used for creating the tract probability maps as well as a shape model
that was used for automatic tract segmentation for the
larger cohort of patients, as described below.
The clinical and demographic characteristics of patients and controls are presented in Table 1.
2.1.3. MRI acquisition
In vivo MRI data were acquired on a 3T General Electric HDx MRI system (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee,
WI) using an eight channel receive-only head RF coil (GE
Medical Devices). We acquired the following sequences:
a T2/proton-density weighted and a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence for lesion identification
and segmentation, a T1-weighted sequence for identification of T1-hypointense MS lesions and for registration,
and a twice-refocussed diffusion-weighted sequence (40
uniformly distributed directions (Jones et al., 1999), b =
1200 s/mm2 ), and a 3D MT sequence. Latter was used
to calculate an additional microstructural parameter independent of the diffusion-weighted images. The acquisition parameters of all scan sequences are reported in Supplementary Table 2.

2.2. Data analysis

2.2.3. In vivo lesion mapping and segmentation
Damage was quantified in three tissue-states, which
were expected to vary in their underlying microstructural
damage: normal appearing white matter, T2-weighted
white matter hyperintense lesional tissue without T1weighted hypointensity, and T1-weighted white matter hypointense lesional tissue with corresponding T2weighted hyperintensity, as reported elsewhere (Lipp
et al., submitted). Briefly, normal appearing white matter was defined as FSL FAST (Zhang et al., 2001) segmented (80% thresholded) white matter at least 5 mm
away from lesions. We classified lesional voxels as T1weighted white matter hypointense if their signal intensity lay at least 1.5 interquartile ranges below the lower
quartile of the distribution in normal appearing white
matter. All other lesional voxels were classified as T2weighted white matter hyperintense lesional tissue without T1-weighted hypointensity. Further, we restricted
all three tissue classes to lesion-susceptible white matter
(white matter with > 5% lesion probability, as defined by
a lesion probability map derived from our data).

2.2.1. Algorithms for resolving fibre orientation
We compared three algorithms for recovering fibre orientational information. Firstly, as done in previous MS
work (Hua et al., 2008; Reich et al., 2010), fibre orientation was estimated using the first eigenvector of the
diffusion tensor. Additionally, we employed two fibre
orientation distribution (FOD) deconvolution algorithms,
which have been developed to overcome some of the limitations related to tensor-based tracking: a constrained
spherical deconvolution (CSD, Tournier et al. (2007)),
and a modified damped Richardson-Lucy algorithm (dRL,
Dell’Acqua et al. (2010)). Deconvolution methods work
by characterising a response function for a single fibre
orientation. This response function is then deconvolved
from the observed signal. The reason for considering both
CSD and dRL is that previous work (Parker et al., 2013b)
showed that while CSD performs better than dRL when
resolving crossing fibres in voxels with low FA, it also
more frequently produces spurious peaks and is more sensitive to mis-calibrations of the FOD. Details on the implementation of the two deconvolution algorithms are re2.2.4. MT processing

in each hemisphere from the manually segmented tracts.
The resulting models were then used to automatically extract the tracts of interest across all datasets (patients and
controls). All automatically segmented tracts were visually inspected and spurious streamlines were removed if
necessary. To validate the automated protocol, for each
of the 29 patients and 19 controls with both manually dissected and automatically dissected tracts, we calculated
the spatial agreement between the two tract masks.

2.2.6. Tractography algorithm
Whole brain tractography was performed in native
space (for the subsample of 29 patients with all three algorithms, and for the entire sample of 131 patients using dRL), using an adaptation of CSD-based streamline
tractography (Jeurissen et al., 2011; Tournier et al., 2004,
2007, 2008). Seed points were evenly distributed across
vertices of a 2mm isotropic grid and propagated in 1mm
steps with streamline length constraints of 20 - 500mm.
The diffusion tensor / fODF peaks were resolved at each
new location (Jeurissen et al., 2011). In the case of
CSD/dRL-based tracking, tracking was terminated if the
fODF threshold fell below the defined threshold or the
direction of streamline changed through an angle greater
than 45◦ between successive steps. In the case of tensorbased tracking, instead of an FOD amplitude threshold,
an FA threshold of .2 was used. The same procedure was
then repeated by tracking in the opposite direction from
the initial seed-points.

2.2.8. Tract probability maps
For both patients and controls tract probability maps
were computed, which indicate each voxel’s likelihood of
being part of an individual’s tract. Each tract was first
converted to a binary voxel-wise mask, indicating which
voxels a tract intersected. To exclude voxels with only
minimal streamlines, the 25% of voxels with lowest number of streamlines were ignored during this process. The
exported tracts of each participant were registered to MNI
space. This was done by first registering each participant’s structural high-resolution T1-weighted image to
MNI space, using ANTs SyN (Avants et al., 2008) and
then applying the warp to the tract NIfTI file (which had
already been registered to the high resolution structural
scan as part of the pre-processing pipeline). From the binary tract masks in MNI space, we computed probability
maps for each tract and hemisphere. The probability maps
for controls were then used to employ the probability-map
based approach for obtaining tract-specific microstructural measures.

2.2.7. Individual tract segmentation
For the purpose of this paper, the CST and arcuate fasciculi were segmented. The CST originates from motor
and premotor cortices and runs to midbrain and medulla,
passing the corona radiata and internal capsule (Al Masri,
2011), whose periventricular spaces are common spots for
lesions (Kincses, 2010). The arcuate fasciculi connect the
perisylvian cortex of the frontal, parietal, and temporal
lobes (Catani and Thiebaut de Schotten, 2008).
Three-dimensional tractograms for specific white matter tracts were extracted from the whole-brain tractograms
by applying multiple way-point of interest gates (Catani
et al., 2002), drawn on color-coded fibre orientation maps
(Pajevic and Pierpaoli, 1999). We applied tract reconstruction protocols to the data from the matched 29 patients and 19 healthy controls. All tract segmentations
for a given tract were performed by the same operator
(CST: EP, Arcuate fasciculus: SG). The protocol followed
for segmentation is described in Supplementary Section
1.1.4. To assess inter-operator spatial agreement, another
operator (SP) dissected all tracts in the data from the first
five healthy controls, and spatial overlap Dice coefficient
scores were calculated (see also Dice (1945); Zijdenbos
et al. (1994); for details see Supplementary Section 1.1.5).
In the healthy control data, the approach of Parker et al.
(2013a) was used to construct a shape model for each tract

2.2.9. Extraction of microstructural damage within tracts
For individual tracts, we computed the microstructural
parameters (FA, RD, MTR) at each point along the individual streamlines (Jones et al., 2005) by trilinear interpolation of the surrounding voxels. We then computed
probability-weighted averages (Reich et al., 2010) of the
tracts, after normalising the parameter maps to MNI space
(which was done by applying the warp obtained for the
T1-weighted image to the parameter maps). The two approaches are comparable in that voxels with higher tract
probability will contribute more strongly to the computed
average.

Crossing fibres. In simulated substrates with two fibre
populations crossing at 90 degrees, by definition, the
tensor-based approach only ever reconstructed one of the
two peaks. For both dRL and CSD, a minimum total intracellular volume fraction of 40% was needed to consistently detect both true peaks (Figure 1), corresponding to
a minimum of 20% per fibre population, which is consistent with what we found in the single fibre population
scenario. In substrates with low fibre content, CSD again
produced false positives in up to 25% of the voxels, while
the false positive rate in the tensor or dRL implementation was negligible. In substrates with intracellular volume fraction above 10%, the dispersion for the truly detected peaks again lay below .15, with the exception of
the tensor-based approach in the crossing fibre condition,
where the tensor could not reliably represent either of the
true fibre orientations.

2.2.10. Comparison between individual tracts and probability map-based approach
Firstly, we investigated the anatomical correspondence
between the two approaches. We calculated weighted
Dice coefficients between individual tract masks (in MNI
space) and tract probability maps as done in Hua et al.
(2008).
Secondly, we checked whether individually dissected
tracts are biased, by omitting damaged parts of the
tract. This was done by comparing tract-averaged microstructure of individually dissected tracts to averaged
microstructure from the group probability maps. If there
was a bias towards the healthy part, the individual measures should indicate less damage than the probabilitybased measures.
3. Results

3.1.2. In vivo results
For each algorithm investigated, we explored its performance within various tissue types: healthy control tissue, normal appearing white matter, white matter lesions
that only appear T2-hyperintense, and white matter lesions that also appear T1-hypointense.
The FA and FOD amplitude of continued streamlines in
T1-hypointense lesional tissue were slightly lower when
comparing to streamlines in lesional tissue without T1weighted hypointensity. However, overall there were no
strong and systematic differences between tissue types
(Table 2). On the other hand, with an increasing level of
pathology, an increasing number of premature streamline
terminations was observed due to the amplitude threshold
not being met. This was only the case for the tensor-based
approach and dRL (Table 2). In contrast, using CSD, with
an increase in pathology, more streamlines were terminated due to the angle criterion. This indicates that while
CSD is equally likely to find peaks passing the amplitude threshold in pathological tissue, these peaks are most
likely to be spurious.
Counterintuitively, all algorithms produced more
streamlines in lesions than in normal appearing white
matter, with no significant differences between the two
lesional tissue types. This result could be due to an increase of spurious streamlines within lesions, but also due
to the preferential localisation of lesions in fibre-rich areas. To check whether the latter might be an explana-

3.1. Comparison of the fibre orientation reconstruction
algorithms
3.1.1. Simulation results
Single fibre population. All three algorithms could successfully reconstruct the peak of the simulated fibre orientation in almost 100% of substrates with an intracellular volume fraction of at least 20%, which corresponded
to an FA value of around .5. The dispersion of successfully reconstructed true peaks consistently lay below .15
(Figure 1). In substrates with intracellular volume fraction below 10%, all algorithms failed to resolve the peak
orientation reliably. Here, CSD-based peak detection resulted in a significant number of false positive peaks (up
to 25%). On the other hand, the tensor-based approach
produced a maximum of 2% false positives. dRL produced less than 0.01% false positives, with the exception of substrates with a single fibre population and the
highest simulated fibre content (80% intracellular volume
fraction). Inspection of the discrete FOD suggests that
this is a truncation artifact of the harmonics that occurred
due to the lack of orientation dispersion in the closely
packed simulated cylinders. This is something that would
only occur in the simulation scenario, as the substrates

a simplification of the axonal arrangement in vivo, where
orientation dispersion occurs even in the most systematically packed regions (Mollink et al., 2017).

Figure 1: Comparison of the three fibre orientation reconstruction algorithms in simulated data. Simulated substrates varied in their intracellular volume fraction (ICFV). The parallel cylinders in each substrate were aligned with the z-axis (single fibre population), or with the z- as well
as the y-axis (crossing fibre populations). A: For each approach (tensor-based, dRL and CSD), we calculated the percentage of all voxels within
each substrate type for which the ’true’ underlying fibre configuration peak(s) could be detected. As a control, we also calculated this percentage
for ’false’ peaks (orthogonal to the true peak(s)). In each case, the left-most plot shows the FA for each substrate type. B: Dispersion across all
detected peaks of a substrate type was calculated. Dispersion was high across wrongly detected peaks, while for substrates with higher intracellular
volume fraction, the true detected peaks by dRL and CSD consistently showed dispersion of < .15.

tion for our results, we registered the voxel-wise ’numberof-streamline’ maps from healthy controls to MNI space,
and performed voxel-wise correlations between the average number of streamlines and the lesion probability observed in the patients. (This was done for voxels with at
least 5% lesion probability, which is the criterion we used
to restrict the normal appearing white matter ROI). There
were small, but significant correlations, indicating that areas with higher lesion probability in patients also have
higher streamline probability in controls (dRL: r = .10,
p < .0001, CSD: r = .26, p < .0001, tensor: r = .18,
p < .0001).

Overlaying the tract probability map in patients with
the lesion probability map (Figure 2 top) confirms that
despite the high lesion probability in that region, the individually segmented tracts run through these areas. In all
controls and more than 90% of the patients (123/131 for
the left and 130/131 for the right), both CSTs could be
reconstructed.

Table 2: Comparison of the three fibre orientation reconstruction algorithms in vivo. For each algorithm (tensor, dRL, CSD) and each tissue
type (Ctrl, NAWM, T2L, T1l), we calculated voxel-wise averages of the following parameters: the number of streamlines found in a voxel, the
average FA / FOD amplitude across all streamlines found in a voxel, the number streamline terminations due to the amplitude threshold in a voxel,
and the number streamline terminations due to the angle threshold in a voxel. The mean ± std of these measures across healthy controls (Ctrl;

data, as simulations are often simplified, e.g. in our case
the fibres in the simulated substrates lacked orientation
dispersion. Systematic and thorough parameter tuning in
pathological in vivo data could potentially help to optimise the use of CSD in MS lesions, but was out of scope
of this study.
Choosing the algorithm for tract segmentation in vivo,
we considered two things. Firstly, dRL seems to be the
more conservative algorithm, which leads to streamline
termination in lesions with high fibre loss, potentially producing tract reconstructions that at least partially omit lesions. CSD produces more streamlines in lesions, but
a considerable number of them may be spurious, which
also hinders the correct reconstruction of tracts that pass
through lesions. The second consideration was theoretical. In contrast to dRL, CSD requires the response function used for the deconvolution to be calibrated from voxels with single underlying fibre populations, which are
generally identified through their high FA. In MS, high
FA voxels are likely voxels with preserved white matter integrity. However, the single fibre response function
is then applied to the lesional tissue, which could lead
to problems with FOD reconstruction and tracking in lesional tissue. Estimating a separate ’pathological’ single

fibre response function from the average response in lesioned voxels is unlikely a sensible alternative, as lesional
tissue is highly heterogeneous. In comparison to CSD,
dRL is more robust to mis-calibrations of the single fibre
response function (Parker et al., 2013b). For this reason,
for the purpose of this paper, we performed the in vivo
whole-brain tractography in MS using dRL.
4.2. Fibre tracking in MS allows to reconstruct tracts that
go through areas with high lesion probability
Even though the CSTs and arcuate fasciculi pass
through white matter regions that are frequently affected
by lesions, we successfully segmented these tracts in individual brains from a large cohort of MS patients. A previously introduced automated tract extraction algorithm
made this a feasible endeavour (Parker et al., 2013a). Unlike the automated approach using tract probability maps
(Reich et al., 2010), this method learns the shape and approximate location of a tract from training data and uses
the resulting model to identify and segment tracts from
whole-brain tractograms, obtained with the same tractography pipeline as in the training data. We found that
the automated approach produces tracts that are realistic with regard to their shapes and anatomical location

and that show high spatial overlap with manually segmented tracts. In all our spatial agreement analyses, for
some individuals the spatial overlap between tracts obtained through different methods was low. This suggests
that even when standard manual segmentation protocols
are robust, the process is not completely objective and
there is still room for error when drawing anatomicallydefined waypoints. Our automatic segmentation method
provides a feasible tool for individual tract segmentation
in a large number of patients.
An obvious reason to be careful about individual tract
segmentation in MS, even when done in an automated
manner, is that if lesions or otherwise damaged parts
of the tract are left out by the tracking algorithm, then
there would be a systematic bias in tract-averaged microstructural parameters towards values from healthier
tissue. We found that individually segmented tracts show
higher FA, lower RD and higher MTR than when employing probability-based tract masks, suggesting the opposite, so more intact microstructure in individually segmented tracts. This is not a surprising result, as the tractography algorithm will preferentially produce streamlines in voxels with high white matter and fibre density. In
contrast, the probability-map approach considers all voxels in the probability map, independent on the underlying white matter in an individual patient. However, importantly, the reported systematic difference between individual and probability-map based tracts we found was
comparable between patients and controls. This finding
suggests that there is no additional disease-related bias in
the individual tract segmentations. While the simulation
and tissue comparison results suggest that the fibre orientation reconstruction algorithms could further be optimised for tracking through lesions, our tract segmentation
results suggest that dRL may be a promising method for
tractography in MS.
4.2.1. The anatomical correspondence of individual and
probability-based approach is modest
Previous studies have suggested using a probabilitybased approach of investigating microstructure in specific
white matter tracts in MS. Here, we showed that the spatial overlap between tract probability maps obtained from
healthy controls, and individually segmented tracts of individuals is modest, with averages ranging from 35% for
the right arcuate fasciculus to 60% for the right CST, with

similar results for patients and controls. The stronger
agreement for the CST suggests that there may be more
individual variability in tract shape and localisation in the
arcuate fasciculus. In both cases, the variability in individual tracts is likely to be partially also a result of the normalisation of individual brains to MNI space, which does
not necessarily align tracts within the homogeneously appearing white matter.
Other methodological factors are likely to play a
role as well. Even though the anatomical correspondence between individual and probability-based approach
was lower than the correspondence between manual
and automatic segmentations and the correspondence between manual segmentations of different operators, latter methodological differences also affected the tract
anatomy. Without ground truth data available, it is difficult to conclude which methods give the most accurate
tract segmentations (Schilling et al., 2019).
4.2.2. The correlation of tract-specific microstructure in
individually segmented vs probability-based tracts
is high
Despite the difference in spatial location and systematic
difference in average microstructural parameters, the correlation of the microstructural information between the individual and probability-map based approaches was high,
particularly for the arcuate fasciculus. Correlations between microstructural parameters from individually segmented tracts vs atlas-based estimations have previously
been reported to be tract-dependent (Reich et al., 2010).
Some of our correlations were also lower, e.g. only 25%
between the two approaches were shared in RD measures
of the right CST. Low correlations for tensor-based measures, such as RD, could be influenced by their sensitivity
to the macroscopic tract shape and individual differences
in tract morphometry (De Santis et al., 2014). This hypothesis is corroborated by the result that the correlation
between individual and probability-based approach in the
CST was highest for MTR, a microstructural metric that
does not show this sensitivity to tract morphometry.
Individual tract segmentation may not bring large benefits compared to the probability-based approach, when
average microstructural parameters of a tract as a whole
are of interest. This can be the case for studies looking
at global effects within specific tracts (e.g. Bonzano et al.
(2014)). Here, averaging microstructural measures should

be less noisy and provide more statistical power and spatial accuracy than voxel-based approaches. However, the
advantage of individual tract segmentation is that it does
not limit the analysis to tract-specific average measures.
Other features of the tract can also be studied, such as tract
shape, tract-specific atrophy (Wang et al., 2018) or the
spatial variation along a tract (Jones et al., 2005; Yeatman
et al., 2012). Very precise anatomical - rather than probabilistic assignment - of lesions to specific white matter
specific tracts could also open doors for clinical questions,
for example on how the appearance or disappearance of
lesions in specific tracts is associated with the presence
or resolution of specific symptoms or with potential secondary damage, such as pathology in the cortical regions
that are directly connected by a tract.
4.2.3. Limitations and future directions
Under the conditions of this study, CSD produced more
spurious peaks than the other algorithms. However, this
is not to say that the algorithm does not have benefits
which could aid tractography in MS patients. For example, CSD has previously been shown to outperform dRL
when resolving crossing fibres under low FA conditions
(Parker et al., 2013b). We only assessed the performance
of the algorithms in the context of tractography, where not
all FOD peaks are reconstructed and considered simultaneously. Instead, at each point along the streamlining
process, the closest detected peak to the current streamline direction is followed, assuming that the tangent to
the streamline minimally subtends the best estimate of
fibre orientation. To mimic the tractography process in
our simulation, the 45 degree angle threshold employed
during streamlining was also employed when assessing
the proportion of successfully detected peaks. This is a
comparatively lenient threshold for assessing peak detection accuracy, with an additional measure of dispersion
confirming orientational agreement between the detected
peaks. While under these specific conditions, CSD produced a large number of false positives, at this point we
are not in a position to comment of the suitability of CSD
for other types of analyses, such as fixel-based analysis
(Raffelt et al., 2015).
We employed standard tractography protocols that have
been optimized in healthy tissue, and that are compatible
with clinically feasible diffusion MRI acquisitions. It is
likely that optimising tractography for MS could benefit

from fine-tuning of some of the parameters for pathological tissue, and also from data with higher angular resolution and multiple diffusion weightings. For example,
the sensitivity of CSD to the increase in isotropic diffusion in lesions may be partly counteracted using multishell - CSD, which considers several tissue compartments
(Jeurissen et al., 2014). Transitioning to multi-shell acquisitions could allow the benefits of such advanced deconvolution methods to be explored.
Simulations produced a simplified version of pathology, and other factors such as permeability, could also
be considered to make the scenario more realistic (e.g.
Nedjati-Gilani et al. (2017)). Ideally, also fibre orientation dispersion is introduced, which is currently not possible with the Camino software package used in the current
study.
The probability-based approach depends on intersubject co-registration of the images by normalising them
to a common reference space. To do this, we chose T1weighted based co-registration, as this is most successful
for aligning pathological brains (Avants et al., 2008), and
to make our results comparable to previous studies (Reich
et al., 2010). However, in future studies, this normalisation step could be further improved, e.g. in the form
of multi-modal registration by white matter parameteric
maps, such as FA maps.
4.2.4. Conclusions
Accurate anatomical assignment of damage to specific
white matter tracts is of clinical interest. In MS research,
tractography-based anatomical segmentation in individual
patients is rarely performed, with probability-based approaches often being the method of choice to avoid potential effects of MS lesions on tractography algorithms. We
show that MS pathology indeed affects the fibre orientation reconstruction that is done during tractography, with
different algorithms being affected differently - lesions led
to an increase in streamline interruptions with dRL, and
an increased number of spurious streamlines with CSD.
Nevertheless, fiber tracking through MS lesions is possible, and can be used to even reconstruct tracts that go
through areas with high lesion probability. The resulting tracts do not seem to systematically omit lesional tissue. A problem with tractography in general is that the
anatomical localisation of the tract does depend on the
specific method used to segment individual tracts. The

1.1.3. Supplementary methods: Fibre orientation algorithm implementation
The diffusion tensor was derived by robust non-linear
least squares fitting (Chang et al., 2005), using ExploreDTI v.4.8.3.
The constrained spherical convolution (CSD) Tournier
et al. (2007) was implemented using in-house scripts. The
single fibre response function was calculated from voxels
with an FA > .8, as done in previous work (Tournier et al.,
2004). For the simulated data, the CSD response function
was estimated from voxels with FA > .8 in the single fibre
population data set. Spherical harmonics were resolved
up to the 6th order. During the tractography process, we
employed an FOD amplitude threshold of > 0.1 that has
been previously optimised (Jeurissen et al., 2013).

1.1.5. Calculation of spatial agreement / Dice coefficient
We calculated spatial overlap Dice coefficient scores
(see also Zijdenbos et al. (1994)) as follows: First the
tracts were exported to binary NIfTI files, then the number of voxels for each operator’s tract and the number of
voxels overlapping in both operators’ tracts were counted
using the AFNI function 3DOverlap (Cox, 1996). Finally,
Dice coefficients were calculated using the equation:
2 × overlapping voxels
, and converted to
voxels in tract 1 + voxels in tract 2

Table 3: Comparison of FOD threshold for CSD in vivo. As done before, for both CSD FOD thresholds (0.1 and 0.3) and each tissue type (Ctrl,
NAWM, T2L, T1l), we calculated voxel-wise averages of the following parameters: the number of streamlines found in a voxel, the average FA /
FOD amplitude across all streamlines found in a voxel, the number of streamlining processes stopped due to the amplitude threshold in a voxel, and
the number of streamlining processes stopped due to the angle threshold in a voxel. The mean ± std of these measures across healthy controls (Ctrl;
N = 19) and patients (NAWM, T2L, T1L; N = 29) are reported. The values across different tissues types were statistically compared (unpaired
t-test between Ctrl and NAWM tissue; paired t-tests for T2OL vs NAWM, and T1L vs T2OL).

Figure 2: Comparison of the three fibre orientation reconstruction algorithms in simulated data with b = 2000 s/mm2 . Simulated substrates
varied in their intracellular volume fraction (ICFV). The true fibre orientation of the parallel cylinders in each substrate was along the z-axis (single
fibre population), or along the z- as well as the y-axis (crossing fibre populations). A: For each approach (tensor-based, dRL and CSD), we
calculated the percentage of all voxels within each substrate type for which the ’true’ underlying fibre configuration peak(s) could be detected. As a
control, we also calculated this percentage for ’false’ peaks (orthogonal to the true peak(s)). In each case, the left-most plot shows the FA for each
substrate type. B: Dispersion across all detected peaks of a substrate type was calculated.

Table 4: Correlations between tract-specific average microstructural metrics for automated vs manual tract dissection. For each metric and
tract and each group separately, the sample size (N) and the Pearson correlation coefficient and the corresponding p-values are reported. From Figure
5 it is evident that some low correlations may be caused by outliers. For these correlations, bivariate outliers were excluded (based on (Rousselet
and Pernet, 2012)) and outlier-robust correlations and corresponding p-values are also reported. Note that correlations were not systematically
lower in patients, even though the tracts from the healthy controls were used to create the model for automated tractography. Acronyms: l: left, r:
