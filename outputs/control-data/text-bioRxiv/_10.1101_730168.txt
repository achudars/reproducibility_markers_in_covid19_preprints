Abstract
Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) but
there is uncertainty about what dose and form of vitamin D could improve the clinical
course of MS. The mechanisms underlying the effects of vitamin D in MS are not
clear. Vitamin D3 increases the rate of differentiation of primary oligodendrocyte
precursor cells (OPCs), suggesting that it might help remyelination in addition to
modulating the immune response. Here we analyzed the transcriptome of
differentiating rat CG4 OPCs treated with vitamin D2 or with D3 at 24 h and 72 h
following onset of differentiation. Differentiation alone changed the expression of
about 10% of the genes at 72 h compared to 24 h. Vitamin D2 and D3 exerted
different effects on gene expression, with D3 influencing 1,272 genes and D2 574 at
24 h. The expression of the vast majority of these genes was either not changed in
differentiating cells not exposed to vitamin D or followed the same trajectory as the
latter. D3-repressed genes were enriched for gene ontology categories including
transcription factors and the Notch pathway, while D3-induced genes were enriched
for the Ras pathway. These findings should help to identify mechanisms mediating
D3 action in MS.

Introduction
There is evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of
developing multiple sclerosis (MS) and with an increased rate of disease
progression1,2. However, the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in MS
patients is still an open question, and interventional trials have reported inconclusive
results3.

Vitamin D is produced in the skin by the action of ultraviolet light. After two
successive hydroxylations, the 1,25(OH)D active form binds to the intracellular
vitamin D receptor (VDR) and, in complex with the retinoid X receptor (RXR),
regulates hundreds of genes through the vitamin D response element (VDRE)1,4.
Vitamin D can also be assimilated from the diet or as a supplement. Both the
plant/fungus-derived vitamin D2, ergocalciferol, and the animal-derived D3 form,
cholecalciferol, are available as nutritional supplements; both can be hydroxylated
into their active forms and bind VDR with similar affinity5, but there are differences in
their catabolism and in their binding affinity to vitamin D binding protein (DBP), the
major vitamin D transport protein in blood, with vitamin D2 binding DBP with lower
affinity and being catabolised more quickly1,4.
Studies comparing vitamin D2 and D3 for their ability to raise and maintain
circulating levels of 25(OH)D, the serum marker of systemic vitamin D levels, have
shown that vitamin D2 is less effective than D3 when given as single bolus6;
however, results following daily administration of D2 or D3 are controversial, with
clinical trials showing higher efficacy of D37,8 or equal efficacy9. In a recent metaanalysis, vitamin D2 and D3 were found equally effective in raising vitamin D levels
in infants10. It has been suggested that vitamin D2 supplementation reduces
circulating vitamin D3 levels; however, a recent randomized controlled trial showed
that the reciprocal is also true11. The general consensus is that vitamin D3 is the
preferred form to be administered3, but few studies have compared D2 and D3 in
terms of their direct cellular effects under controlled conditions.
The mechanisms mediating the protective action of vitamin D in MS are not fully
characterized. In addition to regulating calcium homeostasis, vitamin D is
immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory1,2,12. In the last twenty years, many studies

have reported effects on the brain; vitamin D inhibits neuro-inflammation, is
neuroprotective and neurotrophic1,13-15. VDR is present in neurons and glial cells16,17.
Vitamin D acts directly on brain cells by promoting the differentiation of neural stem
cells (NSCs) into neurons and oligodendrocytes (OLs), and inducing the expression
of growth factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), in neurons and OLs16,18.
The regenerative and neurotrophic effects of vitamin D, together with the presence of
VDR in OLs, suggest that it might have a myelinating action, which might contribute
to its protective effects in MS. In this respect, de la Fuente et al. found that vitamin D
increased the differentiation and maturation of primary oligodendrocyte progenitor
cells (OPCs)19.
Rat central glia-4 (CG4) OPCs are considered a good model of myelination in vitro;
the cells are maintained at the precursor stage by culture with growth factors (GFs),
and can be differentiated into OLs by withdrawal of GFs and culture in differentiation
medium (DM)20-22. Interestingly, Baas et al. found that CG4 cells express VDR, as
primary OPCs, and respond to vitamin D by increasing expression of VDR and of
NGF; however, an effect on myelin proteins was not found, leading to the conclusion
that vitamin D does not positively affect the differentiation of these cells16.
To better understand the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D acts on OLs, we
analyzed the gene expression profile of rat CG4 OPCs in response to vitamin D,
and compared vitamin D2 with D3.

Results
Set up and experimental treatment. We first established the appropriate
experimental conditions for studying the effect of vitamin D on the gene expression
profile of differentiating CG4 cells. In a previous study, Baas et al. found that VDR is

present in CG4 OL precursors and its levels are increased 2-fold after culture for two
days in differentiating conditions16; we therefore hypothesized that a pre-incubation
in differentiation medium (DM) for two days before treatment with vitamin D might
increase the basal levels of VDR and the response to vitamin D. Since VDR is
induced by vitamin D316, we monitored basal and vitamin D3-induced VDR levels in
different culture conditions. The dose of 100 nM vitamin D was chosen based on
previous studies16,19.

pre-incubation in DM for 48 h (Fig. 1b). VDR mRNA was measured after 24 h or 72 h
of incubation with vitamin D3 in both conditions. A 48-h pre-incubation in DM
increased basal levels of VDR and vitamin D3-induced VDR levels at 24 h and 72 h
(Fig. 1). Of note, VDR expression was induced by vitamin D3 at 24 h only after cells
were pre-differentiated for 48 h.
Therefore, the experimental design in Fig. 1b was used for the transcriptome
analysis. After 48 h of pre-differentiation in DM, cells were treated with either vitamin
D2 or D3; RNA was isolated following incubation for a further 24 h and 72 h and
analyzed using whole genome DNA microarrays. The DNA microarray design uses
unique oligonucleotide probes to quantify the abundance of gene transcripts
containing the complementary sequences, and can include more than one probe per
gene. In the presentation of the results below we make the distinction between
probes and genes when necessary, and occasionally use the term “probes-genes”
when no distinction is required.
Effect of vitamin D2 and D3 on gene expression profile. Overall, addition of
either vitamin D2 or D3 to differentiating cells significantly affected gene expression,
an effect that was more marked at 72 h (Fig. 2). Out of 15,247 probes,
corresponding to 12,261 genes (ArrayExpress Accession number E-MTAB-8098)
about 30% were affected by either vitamin D2 or D3 at 72 h, and 10% at 24 h (Fig.
2a).
The numbers of probes-genes affected by vitamin D2 and D3 were broadly similar at
72 h, with most differentially expressed genes regulated by both D2 and D3 (Fig. 2a,
b). However, the shorter-term response at 24 h showed a more pronounced
response to vitamin D3, with notably larger numbers of probes-genes downregulated compared with vitamin D2 (721 versus 147 probes, corresponding to 664

versus 139 genes respectively; Fig. 2a). At 24 h, most genes regulated by D2 were
also regulated by D3, with some other genes regulated by D3 only (Fig. 2b).
To visualize the global effect of vitamin D2 and D3 in relation to untreated cells, we
performed a hierarchical cluster analysis of the 5,565 probes differentially regulated
when comparing vitamin D2 or D3 with their respective controls at both time points,
as well as untreated controls at 72 h versus 24 h. The results are shown as a
heatmap in Fig. 2c.
By comparing untreated control cells (Ctrl) at 72 h with Ctrl at 24 h, we can see that
differentiation alone noticeably affects gene expression. The actual number of
probes-genes regulated in Ctrl 72 h versus Ctrl 24 h is reported in Fig. 2a. Figure 2c
also shows that a number of genes with low expression in control cells are upregulated by both vitamin D2 and D3 at 24 h, an effect even more marked than that
of differentiation at 72 h (e.g. cluster 5 in Fig. 2c). Likewise, some of the genes that
have a high expression in 24 h Ctrl cells seem to be down-regulated by vitamin D2
and D3 at 24 h, an effect similar to differentiation alone (e.g. cluster 9 in Fig. 2c).
This trend is confirmed at 72 h, where vitamin D2 and D3 have a more marked effect
than at 24 h.
Effect of differentiation. To analyze the effect of vitamin D in relation to the effect of
differentiation, we focused on the genes changed by culture in DM alone. As
reported in Fig. 2a, 837 probes (767 genes) were down-regulated and 827 (763
genes) were up-regulated in untreated cells (Ctrl) at 72 h compared to Ctrl at 24h.
The functional enrichment analysis of the 767 down-regulated and of the 763 upregulated genes in the 72 h versus 24 h control cells is reported in Fig. 3a. This
reveals that most of the down-regulated genes were associated with the cell cycle

and the up-regulated genes were significantly (p.adjust £ 0.05) enriched for Gene

7.77E-03), “axon ensheathment” (p.adjust 2.28E-03), “myelination” (p.adjust 6.75E03); this is consistent with the fact that CG4 cells in DM differentiate over time22,23.

more marked. Functional enrichment analysis of the down-regulated clusters 6 and 7
in Fig. 3c identified GO-BP categories associated with cell cycle, whereas “axon
regeneration” (p.adjust 3.73E-02) was one of the GO-BP terms significantly enriched
among the clusters increased by differentiation and by vitamin D2 and D3 (cluster 3,
Fig. 3c).
Analysis of vitamin D-regulated genes in relation to differentiation. A more
specific analysis of the effects of vitamin D on gene expression in relation to the
change in the gene expression profile induced by differentiation alone (Ctrl 72 h
versus Ctrl 24 h) is shown in Fig. 4.
More than half of the genes up-regulated (in orange in the figure) at 24 h by vitamin
D2 (a) or D3 (b) were also induced by differentiation, with the remaining genes (in
grey in the figure) not affected by differentiation alone. Only one gene (spondin 1,
Supplementary File S1) induced by vitamin D2 or D3 at 24 h was changed in the
opposite direction by differentiation.
Of the genes that were down-regulated at 24 h (in blue in Fig. 4) by vitamin D2 (a) or
D3 (b), most genes were down-regulated (in blue in the bottom pie charts of the two
panels) or unaffected (in grey in the bottom pie charts of the panels) by
differentiation. Only few vitamin D-down-regulated probes (six for D2 and eleven for
D3) were changed in the opposite direction by differentiation. In summary, a 24 h
exposure to vitamin D has either a unique effect for specific genes or an effect on
gene expression similar to that of differentiation.

A similar analysis was performed at 72 h (Fig. 4c and d). At this time point, the
overlap between vitamin D- and differentiation-regulated genes is smaller, and most
of the effect on the gene expression profile is unique to vitamin D.

Genes uniquely regulated by vitamin D3 and not by D2. Because vitamin D3 had
a more marked effect on gene expression at 24 h than D2 (Fig. 2a, Fig. 4a and b),
we analyzed the genes uniquely regulated by D3 (but not by D2) at 24 h and their
behavior in relation to differentiation. As shown in Fig. 5, all the genes uniquely
regulated by vitamin D3 were either not changed by differentiation in absence of
vitamin D, or followed the same trajectory as differentiation, with only five probes
down-regulated by D3 but up-regulated by differentiation.

Functional enrichment analysis of the genes corresponding to the probes
significantly decreasing in abundance after 24 h in response to either vitamin D2
(n=147, Fig. 2a and 4a) or D3 (n=721, Fig. 2a and 4b) and of those uniquely downregulated by D3 (n=605; Fig. 5) indicated that the two forms of vitamin D produce
notably different early effects on oligodendrocyte cells (Supplementary Fig. S1,
Supplementary File S3). Interestingly, the 605 genes uniquely down-regulated by D3
at 24 h were significantly enriched for GO terms associated with transcription factor
complex activity (“transcription factor complex”, p.adjust 3.59E-03; “transcription
factor activity”, p.adjust 8.29E-04) suggesting that the two forms of vitamin D might
exert different effects on transcriptional regulation by these complexes. Other
functions similarly and potentially more adversely affected by D3 compared to D2 at
24 h include “RNA splicing” (p.adjust 3.07E-02), “axonogenesis” (p.adjust 7.73E-03),
Toll-like receptor (TLR) cascade pathways (e.g. “TLR3 cascade”, p.adjust 4.01E-03),

Discussion
The main finding of this study is that vitamin D2 and D3 exert markedly different
effects on gene expression in differentiating OPCs. Although there is some overlap
in the genes they regulate, D3 affects a larger repertoire of genes. In particular, we
identified some genes that are specifically influenced by D2 only (31 at 24 h and 66
at 72 h) or D3 only (605 at 24 h and 240 at 72 h), showing that, in this experimental
model, D2 and D3 (or their respective derivatives) might behave as distinct
molecular entities with different biological activities.
In vivo, studies where D2 and D3 are compared are likely to mainly reflect
differences in their pharmacokinetics. This should not be an issue in an in vitro
model that should reflect the direct effect of the molecule tested, and our results are
likely to relate to differences in the biological activity of the two forms of vitamin D.
Although, reportedly, vitamin D2 and D3 have similar affinities for VDR4,5, they may
have different affinity for other vitamin D binding proteins. In fact, the action of
vitamin D is mediated by other receptors and binding proteins such as the retinoidrelated orphan receptors (RORs) and Erp57, a membrane steroid-binding protein
related to protein disulfide isomerase24-26. These additional receptors may have
important biological roles in the central nervous system, and the protective effect of
D3 on axonal growth has been linked to activation of membrane-associated rapid
response steroid-binding receptor (MARRS)/Erp5727.
Vitamin D3 and D2 both up-regulated VDR expression, which was also up-regulated
during OPC differentiation, in agreement with a previous report16. Both vitamins
regulated the expression of many genes that were either not changed in
differentiating cells not exposed to vitamin D or followed the same trajectory as the
latter; only very few genes followed the opposite expression trajectory, suggesting

that in this system, as in primary OLs19, vitamin D promotes rather than antagonizing
differentiation.
Although at 72 h both vitamin D2 and D3 had similar effects on gene expression, at
24 h vitamin D3 was more potent, changing the expression of a substantially higher
number of genes. The preferential action of D3 versus D2 was particularly evident
when considering the down-regulated genes; only about one fourth of the genes
down-regulated by D3 were also down-regulated by D2 at 24 h, whereas most of the
genes down-regulated by D2 were also down-regulated by D3, as shown in Fig. 2.
The higher efficacy of vitamin D3 compared to D2 in increasing myelination had
been previously reported in a rat model of peripheral nerve injury28, but no studies
had directly compared vitamin D2 and D3 in vitro on OL differentiation. It should be
noted, however, that we did not observe any direct effect of vitamin D on the
expression of myelin genes, in agreement with previous studies16, highlighting a
limitation of this experimental model.
Functional enrichment analysis of the genes uniquely down-regulated by D3
(unchanged by D2) at 24 h highlighted an over-representation of transcription
factors; among these, SRY-related HMG-Box Gene 4 (Sox4) and transcription factor
EB (Tfeb), whose high expression has been previously associated with inhibition of
myelination29,30. In addition, the KEGG MAPK signaling pathway was
overrepresented; of note, we previously reported that in this model inhibition of
ERK1/2 MAPK increases OL differentiation22. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2
(Fgfr2) and platelet derived growth factor A (Pdgfa) were included in this pathway
(Supplementary File S3); since both Fgf and Pdgf are needed to maintain CG4
OPCs in the undifferentiated state20,22, inhibition of Fgfr and Pdgf would promote
differentiation.

Considering all the genes down-regulated by D3 at 24 h (and therefore possibly also
by D2), enrichment of the Notch signaling pathway was identified. Activation of the
Notch pathway inhibits OPC differentiation during development and is involved in the
limited remyelination that characterizes MS31,32. Notch is a transmembrane receptor
that is activated upon binding to several ligands, including members of the Jagged
and Delta-like families; these ligands induce sequential cleavage of Notch, with an
essential cleavage performed by a gamma-secretase, which contains presenilin33.
The ligands Jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta-like canonical Notch ligand 3 (Dll3) were
inhibited by both vitamin D2 and D3; in addition, presenilin 1 (Psen1) was inhibited
only by vitamin D3. The inhibitory effect of vitamin D3 on gamma-secretase activity
had been previously reported in the context of Alzheimer’s disease34; in this respect,
gamma-secretase, in addition to Notch, also cleaves the amyloid precursor protein
(APP) to produce amyloid-beta. Inhibition of Notch ligands and of Psn1, and of other
genes belonging to the Notch pathway (Supplementary File S3), suggests a
differentiating effect of vitamin D on these cells. In addition, preferential inhibition of
Psn1 by vitamin D3 and not D2 indicates again that D3 is more efficacious than D2.
Interestingly, inhibition of Notch-signalling molecules, which play a role in cancer
stem cell maintenance, is one of the mechanisms that mediate the anticancer
properties of vitamin D35,36.
Functional enrichment analysis of all the genes up-regulated by D3 revealed
overrepresentation of the GO-BP Ras protein signal transduction (Supplementary
Fig. S2, Supplementary File S3). GTPases of the Ras family affect cell survival,
proliferation and differentiation37, and among these Rras2 was recently found to be
essential for OL differentiation38. Included in this pathway are also nerve growth
factor (Ngf) and transforming growth factor beta 2 (Tgfb2), both reported to activate

Ras-dependent signalling pathways and to promote OPC differentiation39-43. Vitamin
D3-induced upregulation of Ngf in these cells was previously reported16. Of note,
Rras2 and Ngf were also induced by D2, whereas Tgfb2 was uniquely induced by D3
(Supplementary File S3). Also included in this pathway were several Rab genes,
such as Rab36, Rab9d, Rab6a, and Rab3d. Rab proteins, involved in vesicular
transport, are up-regulated during OL differentiation, in particular when OL start
synthesizing myelin44; interestingly Rab6a and Rab3d were uniquely up-regulated by
D3 (GO Molecular Function (GO-MF) “GTP binding”, Supplementary Fig. S2;
Supplementary File S3). In addition, vitamin D3-induced transcription factors (GO
Cellular Component (GO-CC) “nuclear transcription factor complex”, Supplementary
Fig. S2) included Sox2, whose role in OL differentiation was recently reported45,46
and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (Cebpb), a VDR-responsive gene that
controls the differentiation of myeloid leukaemia cells47.
Our identification of specific vitamin D3-regulated genes in OPCs could provide
important insights to understand the mechanisms mediating the activity of vitamin D
in demyelinating disease and point to mechanisms additional to those associated
with immune regulation, the latter being a major research focus for the action of
vitamin D in the context of MS1.

Methods
Cell culture. The rat CG4 OL precursor cell line (OPC), originally obtained from
primary cultures of bipotential oligodendrocyte-type-2-astrocytes (O-2A)20, was
cultured as previously reported 22,23. CG4 cells are maintained at the precursor stage
by culture in growth medium (GM), consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium

(DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with biotin (10 ng/ml), bFGF (5 ng/ml), PDGF
(1 ng/ml), N1 supplement (all from Sigma-Aldrich) and 30% B104-conditioned
medium, obtained as previously reported23. The cells can be differentiated into
mature OLs by withdrawal of growth factors (bFGF and PDGF) and of B104conditioned medium and culture in differentiation medium (DM), consisting of
DMEM-F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with progesterone (3 ng/ml), putrescine (5
µg/ml), sodium selenite (4 ng/ml), insulin (12.5 µg/ml), transferrin (50 µg/ml), biotin
(10 ng/ml), thyroxine (0.4 µg/ml) and glucose (3 g/l) (all from Sigma-Aldrich).
Cells were plated in poly-L-ornithine-coated 12-well plates (100,000 cells in 2 ml GM
per well). After overnight culture, the cells were induced to differentiate by switching
to DM. Cells were cultured for the indicated times; half of the medium was changed
every other day. For vitamin D treatment, vitamin D2 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2;
Cayman Chemical) or vitamin D3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; Sigma-Aldrich) were
dissolved in ethanol (96%; Sigma-Aldrich) at 100 µM and then diluted in medium at
the final concentration (100 nM). Vehicle (ethanol 0.1%) was added to untreated
cells.
RNA extraction. Each sample was lysed with 1 ml of QIAzol (QIAGEN). Total RNA
was extracted using the miRNeasy system and protocol (QIAGEN). RNA
concentration, purity and integrity were determined using a NanoDrop 1C (NanoDrop
Technologies) spectrophotometer and an Agilent 4200 TapeStation (Agilent
Technologies). All samples had a A260/A280 ratio > 1.8 and RNA Integrity Number >
8.2.
RT-qPCR. Reverse transcription (RT) and real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) were
carried out as reported22, using TaqManÒ gene expression assays (Applied
Biosystems/Thermo Fisher Scientific). Results were normalized to HPRT1

expression (reference gene) and expressed as fold change (FC) versus one of the
control samples (as indicated), chosen as the calibrator.
Microarrays. Biological quadruplicate samples were analyzed for each treatment
group. In total, 24 arrays were analyzed: 4 untreated, 4 vitamin D2 and 4 vitamin D3
at each time point (following, respectively, 24 h and 72 h of treatment). Total RNA
(200 ng) was amplified by in vitro transcription using the Low Input Quick Amp One
color kit, incorporating Cy3-labelled CTP (Agilent Technologies), and hybridized onto
SurePrint G3 Rat GE 8 x 60K Microarrays v2 (AMADID 074036; Agilent
Technologies) for 16-20 h at 65°C in an Agilent oven with rotisserie. Following
hybridization, the arrays were washed and scanned to derive the array images, using
an Agilent microarray scanner G2505C. Feature Extraction Software (v11.5; Agilent)
was used to generate the array data from the images, using Agilent grid
074036_D_F_20181024.
Microarray Data Analysis. Data analysis was performed in R48 using the LIMMA
package49. Grid annotation for the AMADID 074036 microarray was downloaded
from Agilent eArray, and gene annotations were obtained from the Rattus.norvegicus
R package based on the M5 genome build50. Microarray data were background
corrected using the “normexp” method (with an offset of 50) and quantile normalized,
producing normalized expression values in the log base 2 scale. Data were then
filtered to remove all control probes, and non-control probes exhibiting low signals
across the array sets. Keeping only those non-control probes that were at least 10%
brighter than negative control probe signals on at least four arrays (based on the
existence of four replicates per condition) left 31,691 out of 62,976 probes. Data from
identical replicate probes within the same array were then averaged to produce
expression values at the unique probe level, obtaining 20,326 unique probes, of

which 15,247 are assigned to genome features with an Entrez gene identifier (Entrez
ID).
Testing for differential expression between the experimental conditions was
performed in LIMMA using linear modelling. Significance p-values were corrected for
multiplicity using the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) method, obtaining adjusted pvalues (adj.P.Val). All the 20,326 unique probes were subjected to differential
expression analysis but only the data for the significantly differentially expressed
probes mapping to an Entrez ID (5,565) are reported in Supplementary File S1 and
were considered in the downstream analyses.
Hierarchical clustering was performed by complete linkage clustering and using the
Pearson correlation for the distance metric. Abundance values for each probe were
transformed to z-scores for clustering. Functional enrichment analysis was
performed using the R package clusterProfiler (version 3.8.1)51. The software
produces adjusted p-values (p.adjust) using the BH correction method.
Data Availability. Raw data in standard format from the microarray experiments
have been deposited in ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) with Accession
number E-MTAB-8098.

(Vit D3). Cells were plated and cultured overnight before switching to differentiation
medium (DM). Vit D3 (100 nM) or vehicle (Ctr) was added simultaneously with DM
(a) or after 48 h (b). VDR gene expression was measured by qPCR 24 h or 72 h
after vitamin D3 or vehicle addition. Data are expressed as fold change (FC) versus
ctr1 and are the mean ± SD of four replicates. *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001 by
Student’s t-test. QPCR analysis was not conducted on D2-treated cultures.
Figure 2. Probes-genes regulated by vitamin D2, vitamin D3 or differentiation alone
at 24 and 72 h. (a) Values represent numbers of probes detecting differentially
expressed genes compared with their respective control (adj.P.Val £ 0.05, testing
significance relative to a 10%-fold change in expression using LIMMA TREAT52).
The Venn diagrams (b) show the number of probes specifically down-regulated (left)
or up-regulated (right) by each vitamin or both. The Ctrl 72 h vs Ctrl 24 h data is not
represented in the Venn diagrams. (c) Hierarchical cluster analysis and heatmap of
all the probes significantly different in any of the comparisons listed in panel a (5,565
probes). All the probes-genes are listed in Supplementary File S1, where information
about the respective clusters is included.
Figure 3. Functional enrichment analysis of the genes regulated during
differentiation alone and effect of vitamin D2 and D3 on these genes. (a) The
enriched Gene Ontology Biological Processes (GO-BPs) among the 767 downregulated (left) and 763 up-regulated (right) genes, shown in Fig. 2A as “Ctrl 72 vs
Ctrl 24”, are listed. The size of the dots is proportional to the number of genes and
the color represents the corrected p-value (p.adjust), as indicated in the legend. (b)

to the genes in (a) (837 down-regulated and 827 up-regulated by differentiation
alone, Fig. 2a); the expression signal at 24 h and 72 h in untreated cells and at 24 h
in D2- and D3-treated cells is shown, to visualize the effect of D2 and D3 versus their
control at 24 h and the effect of differentiation alone at 72 h versus 24 h. (c)
Enriched GO-BP terms corresponding to some of the clusters. All the probes-genes
included in the clusters and in the GO-BPs are listed in Supplementary File S2.
Figure 4. Genes regulated by D2 and D3 at 24 h and 72 h and relative effect of
differentiation alone. The numbers of significant probes are indicated in each pie
chart. The top pie charts in all panels indicate the number of probes that are up- or
down-regulated by vitamin D2 (a and c) or D3 (b and d) compared to the control at
the same time point (a and b, 24 h; c and d, 72 h). The bottom pie charts of all
panels describe how these genes are regulated by differentiation (defined by
comparing Ctrl 72h vs Ctrl 24h). Differentially regulated genes were obtained
according to the same criteria described in the legend to Fig. 2A. All the probesgenes are included in Supplementary File S1, where the membership of the pie chart
groups is reported.
Figure 5. Genes uniquely regulated by vitamin D3 at 24 h and relative effect of
differentiation alone. Numbers in the top pie charts refer to probes up-regulated
(orange) or down-regulated (blue) by D3 versus control but not by D2 versus control.
The list of the probes-genes is reported in Supplementary File S1.
