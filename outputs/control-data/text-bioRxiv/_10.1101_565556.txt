Abstract
Antibiotics induce large and highly variable changes in the intestinal microbiome even at sublethal concentrations, through mechanisms that remain elusive. Using gnotobiotic zebrafish,
which allow high-resolution examination of microbial dynamics, we found that sublethal
doses of the common antibiotic ciprofloxacin cause severe drops in bacterial abundance.
Contrary to conventional views of antimicrobial tolerance, disruption was more pronounced
for slow-growing, aggregated bacteria than for fast-growing, planktonic species. Live imaging
revealed that antibiotic treatment promoted bacterial aggregation and increased susceptibility to intestinal expulsion. Intestinal mechanics therefore amplify the effects of antibiotics
on resident bacteria. Microbial dynamics are captured by a biophysical model that connects antibiotic-induced collapses to gelation phase transitions in soft materials, providing a
framework for predicting the impact of antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome.

Antibiotic drugs induce large, long-lasting, and disease-associated alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota [1, 2, 3]. Even at concentrations well below the minimum
inhibitory levels of many bacteria, antibiotics can lead to major and highly variable changes
in the gut microbiome through mechanisms that remain mysterious [2, 3, 4]. Sublethal
antibiotics can also significantly alter animal physiology; the intentional growth enhancement of livestock is a well-known example that may involve microbiome-mediated pathways
[2]. Low concentrations of antibiotics are often present in the environment as byproducts
of unchecked agricultural and biomedical use, generating public health concerns associated
with the emergence of drug resistance [5] as well as more direct impacts on human health [6].
It is therefore crucial to uncover mechanisms by which sublethal antibiotics reshape resident
gut microbial communities. Understanding why particular bacterial strains are resilient or
susceptible to antibiotic perturbations may allow us to predict the consequences of environmental contamination and may enable tailoring of antibiotic treatments as a therapeutic tool
for manipulating the intestinal microbiome.
Conventional wisdom regarding bacterial responses to antibiotic drugs, derived largely from
in vitro assays, holds that drug tolerance is facilitated by low growth rates and biofilm
formation [7, 8]. Recent work suggests that microbes in the vertebrate gastrointestinal tract
adopt a variety of growth and aggregation phenotypes [9, 10, 11, 12], raising the question
of whether antibiotic susceptibility in the gut bears the same relationship to kinetics and
physical structure as in less dynamic environments, or whether the strong mechanical activity
and large fluid flows present in the intestine [13] lead to fundamentally different rules.
To investigate the in vivo response of gut bacteria to low-dose antibiotic exposure, especially
the relationship between susceptibility and bacterial behavior, we conducted live imagingbased studies of larval zebrafish (Fig. 1A, 1B), spanning the entire intestinal volume with
spatial and temporal resolutions not attainable in humans or other model vertebrates. We
focused our study on two native zebrafish bacterial isolates, both frequently found in the
intestine [14], that we identified as representing extremes of growth and aggregation phenotypes [10]. The first, Vibrio cholerae ZWU0020, hereafter referred to as Vibrio, exists in
the larval zebrafish intestine primarily as dense populations of highly motile and planktonic
individuals (Fig. 1C, Supplemental Movie 1). Vibrio grows rapidly, with an in vivo doubling
time of approximately 1 hour (exponential growth rate of 0.8 ± 0.3 1/hr) [15]. The second, Enterobacter cloacae ZOR0014, hereafter referred to as Enterobacter , primarily forms
large, dense bacterial aggregates with small sub-populations of non-motile planktonic cells
(Fig. 1D, Supplemental Movie 2) [16] and has an in vivo doubling time of approximately 2.5
hours (exponential growth rate of 0.27 ± 0.05 1/hr) (Fig. S1). To delineate and quantify
antibiotic responses independent of inter-bacterial competition, we studied Vibrio and Enterobacter separately in hosts that were initially raised germ-free (Materials and Methods).
We assessed response dynamics of each bacterial population after treatment with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, a broad spectrum fluoroquinolone that interferes with DNA replication by
inhibiting DNA gyrase. Ciprofloxacin is widely administered therapeutically and has been

used as a model antibiotic in studies of human microbiome disruption [17]. Furthermore,
ciprofloxacin is often detected in environmental samples at ng/ml concentrations that are
sublethal but capable of perturbing bacterial physiology [18, 19].

56

As detailed below, we discovered that sublethal levels of ciprofloxacin lead to major reductions in intestinal abundance of both Vibrio and Enterobacter that could not be predicted
from in vitro responses alone. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the slow-growing and
highly aggregated Enterobacter was impacted far more severely than the fast-growing, planktonic Vibrio. Changes in bacterial abundances were driven primarily by clearance from the
intestine by peristaltic-like fluid flow, which impacts aggregated bacteria more severely than
planktonic cells. Exposure to sublethal levels of ciprofloxacin shifted both species to a more
aggregated state, but for Enterobacter this state was unsustainable and led to population
collapse and extinction. Quantitative image-derived population data motivate and are well
fit by physical models originally used to describe colloidal growth and polymer gelation,
implying an antibiotic-induced phase transition in bacterial community physical structure
and revealing a general framework for understanding and predicting intestinal antibiotic
perturbations.

Low-dose ciprofloxacin increases bacterial aggregation and intestinal expulsion
For both Vibrio and Enterobacter, we empirically determined a ciprofloxacin dosage that
induced clear changes in bacterial physiology and behavior in vitro, but that was below the
apparent minimum inhibitory concentration. We first describe results of antibiotic exposure,
in vitro and in vivo, for the Vibrio species.
From an initial survey of dose-response in rich media, we identified 10 ng/mL ciprofloxacin
as an appropriate exposure for Vibrio populations. Growth of Vibrio in lysogeny broth in
the presence of 1 ng/ml ciprofloxacin closely resembles that of the untreated control, while a
concentration of 100 ng/ml is largely inhibitory (Fig. S2A). An intermediate concentration
of 10 ng/ml leads to a stable, intermediate optical density. Viability staining (Materials and
Methods) after 6 hours of incubation with 10 ng/ml ciprofloxacin identifies 30-80% of cells as
alive (Fig. S3A and S3B), again consistent with this antibiotic concentration being sufficient
to perturb the bacterial population without overwhelming lethality. Growth in the presence
of 10 ng/ml ciprofloxacin induces marked changes in cell morphology and motility: treated
cells exhibit filamentation, making them considerably longer (mean ± std. dev. 5.3 ± 3.1
µm) than untreated Vibrio (2.9 ± 0.9 µm) (Fig. S2B). Swimming speed was also reduced
compared to untreated cells (mean ± std. dev. 11.4 ± 7.2 µm/s, untreated 16.9 ± 11.1
µm/s) (Fig. S2C, Supplemental Movies 3 and 4). We note also that 10 ng/ml ciprofloxacin
is comparable to levels commonly measured in environmental samples [18].

While useful for illuminating the appropriate sub-lethal concentration to further examine,
experiments in rich media conditions are not an optimal assay for comparison of in vitro
and in vivo antibiotic treatments, as the chemical environments are likely very dissimilar.
We therefore assessed effects of ciprofloxacin on bacterial populations in the aqueous environments of the flasks housing the larval zebrafish in comparison to populations in the
intestines. In the flask water, as in the intestine, the only nutrients are fish-derived. Oxygen
levels are comparable to those in the larval gut, due to fast diffusion and the animals’ small
size. Bacteria in flask water therefore constitute a useful baseline against which to compare
antibiotic impacts on intestinal populations.
Vibrio was associated with germ-free zebrafish at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) by inoculation of the aqueous environment at a density of 106 cells/ml (Materials and Methods) and
allowed to colonize for 24 hours, which based on previous studies provides ample time for
the bacterial population to reach its carrying capacity of approximately 105 cells/gut [15].
Animals and their resident Vibrio populations were then immersed in 10 ng/ml ciprofloxacin
for 24 or 48 hours, or left untreated (Fig. 2A and 2B). Vibrio abundances in the gut were assayed by gut dissection and plating to measure colony forming units (CFUs) (Materials and
Methods). Abundances in the flask water were similarly assayed by plating. We quantified
the effect of the antibiotic treatment by computing the ratio of bacterial abundances in the
treated and untreated cases, resulting in a normalized abundance (Fig. 2C). After a 24 hour
treatment, log10 -transformed abundances in the flask water dropped by 0.98 ± 0.4 (mean ±
std. dev.) compared to untreated controls, or one order of magnitude on average. In contrast, log10 -transformed intestinal abundances showed a more severe reduction of 1.75 ± 0.88
(Fig. 2C), or a factor of approximately 60 on average, suggesting that the intestinal environment amplifies the severity of ciprofloxacin treatment. For the 48 hour treatment, the
declines in flask water and intestinal abundances were similarly severe (Fig. 2C). In terms
of absolute abundances, pooled data from 24 and 48 hour treatments gives a mean ± std.
dev. of the log10 -transformed Vibrio population of 3.1 ± 0.9 (n = 40), compared to 4.9 ±
0.5 (n = 42) for untreated specimens (Fig. 2D). Unpooled data are similar (Fig. S3E, S3F).
To assess the possibility that the intestine makes Vibrio more susceptible to ciprofloxacininduced cell death, we embedded larval zebrafish in a 0.5% agarose gel, which allowed collection of expelled bacteria. After staining expelled bacterial cells with the viability dyes
SYTO9 and propidium iodide, we imaged ejected material. We found no detectable difference between ciprofloxacin-treated and untreated populations (Fig. 2F, insets). Similarly
sizeable fractions of viable and non-viable cells are evident in both ciprofloxacin-treated and
untreated populations; however, co-staining of zebrafish host cells hindered exact quantification (Fig. S4). This result suggests that the ciprofloxacin-induced population decline
observed in vivo occurs independent of overt cell death and is a consequence of the response
of living bacteria to the intestinal environment. We further note that the dose-response of the
intestinal Vibrio abundance (Fig. S5) mirrors the dose-response of the in vitro growth rate,
implying that the larval gut does not significantly alter or concentrate ciprofloxacin. This
is also consistent with the widespread use of zebrafish larvae as a pharmacological screening
platform, as water soluble chemicals readily enter and leave the animal [20, 21].

To investigate the causes of ciprofloxacin’s disproportionately large impact on in vivo bacterial abundance, we used light sheet fluorescence microscopy to directly monitor Vibrio
populations within the intestine over several hours as they responded to antibiotic exposure.
Three-dimensional time-lapse imaging revealed that within hours of ciprofloxacin treatment,
large numbers of bacteria became depleted from the anterior-localized planktonic and motile
population (Supplemental Movies 5 and 10). Cells were instead found in the mid and distal
regions of the gut, where they appeared to be condensed into large multicellular aggregates
prior to being expelled from the gut altogether (Supplemental Movies 5 and 11). After
10 hours of exposure, Vibrio populations in ciprofloxacin-treated hosts contained large, 3D
aggregates localized to the posterior of the intestine, a feature not observed in untreated
controls (Fig. 2E and 2F) nor in all previous characterizations of this strain [15, 10]. We
note also that in vitro, antibiotic-treated Vibrio does not form large aggregates (Fig. S3 and
S6, Supplemental Movie 4)
To determine whether the bacterial aggregation observed in vivo stems from a fundamentally
different response to antibiotics at the single-cell level or different large-scale consequences of
similar cell-level response, we generated in Vibrio a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter
of the SOS pathway (Fig. S7, Materials and Methods), a DNA damage repair pathway
induced by genotoxic agents such as ciprofloxacin [22, 23]. Genes in the SOS regulon halt
replication and enable DNA repair, and also affect motility and biofilm formation [24, 19].
In vitro, we found that treatment with 10 ng/ml ciprofloxacin strongly induced recN -based
SOS reporter activity, with a heterogeneous response across individual cells (Fig. S3C and
S3D). Within the intestine, SOS reporter activity was also heterogeneous, appearing in both
planktonic and aggregated cells. Planktonic cells that were SOS-positive appeared more
filamented and less motile compared to SOS-negative cells within the same host (Supplemental Movie 6). The activation of the SOS reporter in vitro and in vivo by ciprofloxacin
(Supplemental Movie 6 and Fig S3C and S3D) suggests that in both cases a canonical SOS
response is involved in the perturbation of Vibrio physiology.
Together, these data begin to reveal a mechanism by which the intestine amplifies the effect of low-dose ciprofloxacin. Individual Vibrio cells first undergo an SOS response that
is associated with changes in cellular morphology and behavior. In the context of the mechanical activity of the intestine, these molecular and cellular-level changes then give rise to
population-level aggregation and spatial reorganization throughout the entire length of the
intestine, with the population shifting its center of mass posteriorly (Fig. 2G, n = 4 per
case). This process culminates in the expulsion of large bacterial aggregates from the host,
causing a precipitous decline in total bacterial abundance (Fig. 2H).

Low-dose ciprofloxacin suppresses small cluster reservoirs associated with intestinal persistence
In contrast to Vibrio, Enterobacter is slower growing, non-motile, and naturally forms dense
aggregates within the zebrafish intestine. Enterobacter populations have an in vivo growth

rate of 0.27 ± 0.05 h−1 (mean ± std. dev, Fig. S1), compared to 0.8 ± 0.3 h−1 for Vibrio [15].
Based on conventional notions of antibiotic tolerance, we hypothesized that Enterobacter
would be less affected by ciprofloxacin treatment than the fast growing, planktonic Vibrio.
However, as detailed below, we found this prediction to be incorrect; Enterobacter exhibits
an even greater response to low-dose ciprofloxacin.
We first established in vitro that 25 ng/ml ciprofloxacin produces similar effects on Enterobacter growth as did 10 ng/ml exposure on Vibrio. With the identical inoculation procedure
used for Vibrio, log10 -transformed Enterobacter abundance in the flask water dropped by 1.2
± 0.4 (mean ± std. dev.) compared to untreated controls after 24 hours, and dropped by
1.8 ± 0.2 after 48 hours (Fig. 3A). These values match well the values for Vibrio: 0.98 ± 0.37
for 24 hours, 1.81 ± 0.5 for 48 hours. Assays in rich media show a similarly reduced density
between the two species (Fig. S8) and an even lesser degree of cell death and damage in vitro
for Enterobacter as compared to Vibrio, with a viable fraction of approximately 95% (Fig.
S9A and S9B). As with Vibrio, in vitro growth measurements and viability staining both
imply that low-dose ciprofloxacin treatment of Enterobacter induces growth arrest rather
than widespread lethality.
Strikingly, low-dose ciprofloxacin treatment of fish colonized with Enterobacter (Materials
and Methods) resulted in even greater reductions in abundance than in the case of Vibrio,
with the majority of populations becoming nearly or completely extinct during the assay
period (Fig. 3A and 3B). Inoculation, treatment, dissection, and plating were performed
as for Vibrio (Materials and Methods). Compared to untreated controls, log10 -transformed
intestinal abundances were reduced by 2.3 ± 1.1 after 24 hours, and by 3.2 ± 1.0 after 48
hours (Fig. 3A). These reductions in intestinal abundances greatly exceeded the reductions
of bacterial abundances in the flask water (Fig 3A). In terms of absolute abundances, pooled
data from 24 and 48 hour treatments gives a mean ± std. dev. of the log10 -transformed
Enterobacter population of 1.5 ± 1.0 (n = 40), compared to 4.0 ± 1.0 (n = 39) for untreated
specimens (Fig. 3B); unpooled data are similar (Fig. S9C and S9D).

198

Live imaging of intestinal populations at single time points revealed approximately 40% of
treated hosts to be devoid or nearly devoid of Enterobacter, consistent with the platingbased measurements. In hosts that contained appreciable bacterial populations we observed
a clear difference between treated and untreated specimens: Enterobacter populations in
ciprofloxacin-treated hosts contained fewer small bacterial clusters and fewer individual
planktonic cells than untreated controls (Fig. 3C and 3D). We quantified this distinction using computational image analysis to identify each cluster (Materials and Methods), defining
a single cell as a cluster of size one. Bacterial populations in ciprofloxacin-treated animals
contained ∼80x fewer clusters than untreated animals (Fig. 3C). Viability staining showed
that there were no obvious differences in the viable fractions of bacteria expelled from the
intestines of untreated and treated hosts (Fig. 3D, insets, Fig. S10). As with Vibrio,
these observations suggested that the reduction in Enterobacter ’s intestinal abundance was
independent of cell death.

bacterial aggregates are highly susceptible to expulsion from the gut [15, 25]. To establish
whether this is also the case for Enterobacter in the absence of low-dose ciprofloxacin treatment, we performed time-lapse 3D imaging (Materials and Methods). Indeed, in 2 out of 5
hosts imaged for 3.5 hours each, we observed events in which the largest bacterial aggregate
was abruptly expelled from the intestine (Fig. 4A and Supplemental Movie 7). These timelapse movies also showed clear examples of cluster aggregation (Supplemental Movie 8), in
which single cells and small aggregates appear to come together and fuse, a process that is
likely due to the rhythmic intestinal contractions that occur between frames. Importantly,
smaller aggregates and planktonic cells that preferentially localize to the intestinal bulb are
relatively undisturbed during these expulsion events, save for a few clusters that become
incorporated into the large mass during its transit (Supplemental Movie 7).

233

Our observations suggest an explanation of how low-dose ciprofloxacin can lead to dramatic
drops in Enterobacter abundance that moreover illuminates the more general question of how
naturally aggregating bacterial species can persist in the vertebrate gut in spite of transportdriven expulsion. We provide both a qualitative and a quantitative description of the relevant
dynamics, beginning with the following conceptual model: single cells of Enterobacter replicate to form small clusters, which then aggregate to form larger clusters under the influence
of intestinal flow. Large clusters are transported by the rhythmic contractions of the gut
[15, 25, 26] and are stochastically expelled from the host [15, 25]. The individual bacteria
and small clusters that remain within the intestine serve as a reservoir that reseeds the next
population, and the process of replication, aggregation, and expulsion repeats. Therefore,
persistence within the intestine requires processes that generate single cells or small clusters,
otherwise transport will eventually lead to extinction. This reseeding could take the form
of (i) immigration of new cells from the environment, (ii) passive fragmentation of clusters,
or (iii) active fragmentation in which single cells break away from a cluster surface during
cell division. Immigration from the environment likely occurs even in established populations, but measurements in larval zebrafish suggest very low rates of immigration [27]. We
therefore suspected that more robust mechanisms must promote persistence. Supporting
the active fragmentation mechanism, we found in untreated hosts examples of Enterobacter
populations that contain an abundance of single cells, a single large aggregate, and a lack
of mid-sized aggregates (Fig. S9E). Following low-dose ciprofloxacin treatment, the planktonic cell reservoir associated with resilience to intestinal transport is depleted (Fig. 3C),
most likely due to stalled Enterobacter division (Fig. S8), leading to collapse of the resident
bacterial population (Fig. 3A and 3B).

To solidify and test our conceptual picture, we developed a predictive mathematical model
of bacterial cluster dynamics. We describe the framework of the model, its validation, and
general insights it provides into perturbations and population stability. Drawing on ideas
from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and soft matter physics, we constructed a general kinetic model that describes the time evolution of a collection of bacterial clusters with

varying sizes, illustrated schematically in Fig. 4B. We posit that four processes govern cluster dynamics: aggregation, fragmentation, growth, and expulsion. Each is described by a
kernel that specifies its rate and size dependence: (1) aggregation of a cluster of size n and
a cluster of size m occurs with rate Anm ; (2) fragmentation of a cluster of size n + m into
clusters of size n and m occurs with rate Fnm ; (3) growth (due to cell division) of a cluster
of size n occurs with rate Gn ; (4) expulsion (removal by intestinal transport) of a cluster of
size n occurs with rate En . Note that condensation of the population into a single massive
cluster poises the system for extinction, for any nonzero En . The model is non-spatial and is
inspired by well established frameworks for nucleation and growth phenomena such as polymer gelation and colloidal aggregation [28]. For example, sol-gel models describe a transition
between dispersed individual units (“sol”) and a system-spanning connected network (“gel”)
in materials capable of polymerization. In the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size,
the model can be studied using standard analytic techniques [28]. However, unlike polymer
solutions and other bulk systems for which the possible number of clusters is effectively unbounded, our intestinal populations are constrained to have at most a few hundred clusters
(Fig. 3C), necessitating the use of stochastic simulations (Materials and Methods).
In its general form, the model encompasses a wide range of behaviors that can be encoded
in the various functional forms possible for the rate kernels Anm Fnm , Gn , and En . Based
on our observations and theoretical considerations elaborated in the Materials and Methods
section, we made the following assumptions: (1) the rate of aggregation between two clusters
is independent of their size, Anm = α; (2) fragmentation occurs only by separation of single
cells and with a rate that is independent of cluster size, Fnm = β for m = 1 and Fnm = 0
otherwise; (3) growth is logistic with a global carrying capacity, Gn = rn(1 − N/K) with
N the total number of cells, r the per capita growth rate, and K, the carrying capacity;
(4) expulsion is independent of cluster size, En = λ. This model contains as special cases
various simple models of linear polymers [29] and also resembles recent work modelling
chains of Salmonella typhimurium cells in the mouse gut [30]. As discussed in the Materials
and Methods section, these choices constitute the minimal model consistent with theoretical
constraints and experimental phenomenology. More complex models are of course possible,
but the requisite increase in the number of adjustable parameters would result in a trivial
but meaningless ability to fit the observed data.
Even with the assumptions described above, the model needs 5 parameters: rates of aggregation, fragmentation, growth, and dispersal, and a global carrying capacity. However, all
of these parameters can be set by experimentally derived values unrelated to cluster size
distributions. We measured Enterobacter ’s per capita growth rate by performing time-lapse
imaging of initially germ-free hosts that had been exposed to Enterobacter for only 8 hours,
capturing the exponential increase of a small founding population (Fig. S1, Supplemental
Movie 9), yielding r = 0.27 ± 0.05 hr−1 (mean ± std. dev across n = 3 hosts). We identified
expulsion events as abrupt collapses in Enterobacter abundance from time-lapse images (Fig.
3C, Supplemental Movie 7) and set the expulsion rate equal to the measured collapse rate,
λ = 0.11 ± 0.08 hr−1 (mean ± standard error, assuming an underlying Poisson process (Materials and Methods)). The model can be simulated to provide the mean and variance of the
log10 -transformed abundance distribution at a given time for a given set of parameters. Using

this approach, we fit static bacterial abundance measurements from dissection and plating at
72 hours post-inoculation (Materials and Methods) to determine the carrying capacity, K,
and the ratio of fragmentation and aggregation rates, β/α. As discussed in the Materials and
Methods section, the cluster dynamics should depend primarily on the ratio of β/α rather
than either rate separately. This yielded log10 K = 5.0 ± 0.5 and log10 β/α = 2.5 ± 0.4.

298

The model therefore allows a parameter-free prediction of the size distribution of Enterobacter aggregates, plotted in Fig. 5A together with the measured distribution derived from
three-dimensional images, averaged across 12 untreated hosts. The two are in remarkable
agreement. We also plot, equivalently, the cumulative distribution function P (size > n),
the probability that a cluster will contain greater than n cells, again illustrating the close
correspondence between the data and the prediction and validating the model. We emphasize that no information about the cluster size distribution was used to estimate any of the
model parameters. We further note that the cluster size distribution is a stringent test of
the model’s validity. Other cluster models predict different forms, typically with steep tails
[29, 30]. The linear chain model of [30], for example, leads to an exponential distribution of
cluster sizes that does not match the shallower, roughly power-law form of our data.

Our kinetic model provides insights into the consequences of low-dose antibiotic perturbations on gut bacterial populations. We consider a general phase diagram of possible growth,
fragmentation, aggregation, and expulsion rates, and then situate Enterobacter in this space.
For simplicity of illustration, we consider a two-dimensional representation with one axis being the ratio of the fragmentation and aggregation rates, β/α, and the other being the ratio
of the growth and expulsion rates, r/λ (Fig. 5B). As noted above and in the Materials and
Methods section, the model in the regime studied should depend on the ratio β/α rather
than on β or α independently. However, the roles of r and λ are not simply captured by their
ratio. The expulsion rate nonetheless provides a scale to which to compare the growth rate,
r, and we plot Fig. 5B using r/λ calculated for fixed λ = 0.11 hr−1 , the measured value.
For completeness, we show a three-dimensional r, λ, β/α phase diagram as Figure S11E and
S11F. We numerically calculated the steady state phase diagram of the model (Materials
and Methods) and show in Figure 5B the mean log-transformed abundance, hlog10 (N + 1)i.
The regime of extinction (N = 0) is evident (dark purple, with dashed white boundary ).
The data-derived parameter values place untreated intestinal Enterobacter fairly close to
the extinction transition (Fig. 5B). An antibiotic-induced growth rate reduction of approximately 5x is sufficient to cross the boundary to the N = 0 regime (i.e. to extinction),
moving downward in Fig. 5B. This growth rate reduction, or an equivalent increase in death
rate, reflects the conventional view of antibiotic effects. An approximately 300x reduction in
the balance between fragmentation and aggregation spurs an alternative path to extinction,
moving leftward in Fig. 5B, reflecting a distinct mechanism resulting solely from changes
in physical structure. The extinction transition in this direction corresponds to the conden-

sation of the population into a single cluster, reminiscent of gelation phase transitions in
polymer systems. As described above, low-dose ciprofloxacin causes a strong reduction in
the number of small bacterial clusters, lowering β and possibly also r if fragmentation and
individual cell division are linked. Conservatively assuming an equal effect along both axes,
and fitting simulations to the 24 hour treatment abundances (Materials and Methods), we
find that the antibiotic reduces r and β/α by ∼10x. This drives the bacterial system through
the phase boundary and well into the extinction regime (Fig. 5B, orange circle), consistent
with our observations.

339

In contrast to Enterobacter, treatment of Vibrio with ciprofloxacin does not lead to widespread
extinction after 48 hours, suggesting that treated populations either lie safely at a new steady
state away from the extinction boundary, or are close enough to the transition so that dynamics are slow. To estimate model parameters for ciprofloxacin-treated Vibrio, we performed a
two parameter fit of (β/α, r) to the 24 hour treatment abundances. Because of Vibrio’s large
population size (∼ 105 clusters), we modified the stochastic simulation procedure using a tauleaping algorithm (Materials and Methods, Fig. S12). We indeed find ciprofloxacin-treated
Vibrio is located close to but safely inside the extinction boundary (Fig. 5B). Untreated
Vibrio populations show no appreciable multicellular aggregation and are located off-scale
far to the upper-right side of the phase diagram (Fig. 5B, arrow).

We have discovered that sublethal levels of a commonly used antibiotic can reduce the
intestinal abundance of bacterial populations much more severely than would be predicted
from in vitro responses, and that this amplification is a consequence of drug-induced changes
to the bacterial groups’ spatial architecture. Contrary to conventional notions of antibiotic
tolerance, largely derived from in vitro studies, reductions in bacterial abundances were
greater for the slow-growing, aggregated Enterobacter species than for the fast-growing,
planktonic Vibrio. Live imaging revealed drug-induced increases in bacterial cohesion that,
coupled to gut mechanical activity, lead to the expulsion of viable bacterial cells. The
microscopic details of this cohesion, likely involving cell wall characteristics, mechanical
compression by the gut wall and fluid flows, and perhaps intestinal mucus rheology, remain
to be explored.
Notably, the underlying processes of bacterial aggregation and host intestinal transport are
found throughout the animal kingdom, suggesting a general relevance beyond zebrafish that
may explain, for example, data on weak antibiotics having strong effects on mammalian microbiomes [2, 3]. Of course, chemical perturbations in more anatomically complex animals
or non-gnotobiotic animals that house hundreds of resident bacterial species will undoubtedly involve additional processes beyond those uncovered here. We note, however, that
responses to intestinal flow will influence bacterial population dynamics regardless of ecological complexity, and that our choice of model bacterial species spans the extremes of highly
planktonic and highly cohesive strains, further implying generality. In the larval zebrafish,

enhanced bacterial susceptibility to transport leads to expulsion from the gut. In larger or
more complex intestines this may take the form of displacement from one region to a more
distal region, with a corresponding shift in local nutrients or competitors, in addition to
expulsion from the gut altogether.
The concentrations of ciprofloxacin examined here are commonly found in environmental
samples, indicating a potentially widespread perturbation of animal gut microbiota due to
antibiotic contaminants. In addition, the expulsion of live, antibiotic-exposed bacteria from
animal intestines through the aggregation-based processes described here suggests a potential
mechanism for enhanced spread of antibiotic resistance. This possibility is bolstered by our
observation that in addition to aggregation, ciprofloxacin-treated cells undergo an active
SOS response, which has been shown to promote mutation and horizontal gene transfer
[31, 32, 33]. Together, these observations underscore recent concerns about the public health
risk posed by antibiotic contaminants in the environment [6].
Our biophysical model of aggregation, fragmentation, growth, and expulsion describes our
data well and provides testable predictions. It is remarkable, given the chemical and morphological complexity of even the larval zebrafish gut, that such a minimal model can accurately
predict emergent properties such as the size distribution of bacterial aggregates. That this
works is an indication of the power of theories of soft condensed matter physics, whose
generality may prove useful in understanding the gut microbiome. Furthermore, our model
supplies a framework for a quantitative understanding of gut microbial homeostasis in general. Like recent work modelling antibody-mediated enchaining of Salmonella cells in the
mouse gut [30], our model implies that the physical processes of bacterial cluster formation and fragmentation play central roles in large-scale microbiota stability. We suggest
that our cluster-dynamics model, validated by quantitative agreement between predictions
and in vivo data (Fig. 5A), may prove useful in less tractable host species such as mice
and humans. Without live imaging or non-invasive sampling, it is challenging to estimate
kinetic properties of microbial populations, such as aggregation rates. However, advances
in histological sample preparation [34] can preserve bacterial aggregates and yield cluster
size distributions; inverting our model, such distributions can reveal the underlying in vivo
bacterial kinetics.
Regarding antibiotics, the main prediction of our model is that naturally aggregated, slow
growing bacteria will be impacted more severely than fast growing, planktonic species by
equivalent low-dose antibiotic perturbations. This is contrary to conventional wisdom that
links bacterial tolerance to reduced growth and increased aggregation [7, 8], which stems
from studies of antibiotic exposure in static or well-mixed environments. We find that in
the intestine, where bacteria can be removed through fluid flow, there exist critical values
of aggregation, fragmentation, growth, and expulsion rates, beyond which sustainable colonization becomes impossible (Fig. 5B). Naturally aggregated and slow-growing species are
situated closer to this extinction phase boundary and are therefore more easily driven to population collapse by low-dose antibiotic perturbations. Intriguingly, new meta-omics methods
[9] can be used to estimate in vivo growth rates of mammalian gut microbes, which would
be interesting to correlate with antibiotic responses. We note in addition that inter-bacterial

competition in the gut can be influenced by clustering and susceptibility to intestinal transport [15, 25], suggesting that competition outcomes could be altered by antibiotic treatment
if changes in aggregation properties are different for different species. A final prediction
of our model is that intestinal transport, which has been linked to microbiota composition
[13], will influence the effects of low-dose antibiotic perturbations on microbial community
composition. Combining pharmacological manipulations of intestinal transport with antibiotic treatments may therefore lead to novel strategies for precision engineering of the gut
microbiome.

Vibrio cholerae ZWU0020 and Enterobacter cloacae ZOR0014 were originally isolated from
the zebrafish intestine [14]. Fluorescently marked derivatives of each strain were previously generated by Tn7 -mediated insertion of a single constitutively expressed gene encoding dTomato [16]. We note that all plating- and imaging-based experiments performed in
this study were done using fluorescently marked strains, which carry a gentamicin resistance
cassette, with the exception of experiments in which fluorescent dyes were used to assess viability of cells. Archived stocks of bacteria were maintained in 25% glycerol at -80◦ C. Prior
to experiments, bacteria were directly inoculated from frozen stocks into 5 ml LB media (10
g/L NaCl, 5 g/L yeast extract, 12 g/L tryptone, 1 g/L glucose) and grown for ∼16 hours

To identify a suitable promoter within the Vibrio ZWU0020 genome (https://img.jgi.
doe.gov/m/, IMG genome ID: 2522572152) for creation of a genetically encoded fluorescent
DNA-damage ‘SOS’ reporter, we scanned the upstream regions of each gene for consensus
gammaproteobacterial ‘SOS boxes’ (CTGTN8 ACAG) that serve as binding sites for the repressor LexA (Fig. S7A and S7B) [22]. Of the genes identified, the promoter of the gene recN
(IMG gene ID: 2705597027) was an ideal candidate for three main reasons: 1) it contains
multiple SOS boxes (2 consensus and 2 with 2 mismatches), which is an arrangement that
is potentially associated with tight/graded regulation [23]; 2) the recN promoter is highly
conserved among closely related V. cholerae strains as well as other non-Vibrio gammaproteobacterial lineages, suggesting that recN is a bona fide representative of the SOS response;
and 3) recN is one of the most highly expressed genes in response to DNA damaging agents in
both E. coli and V. cholerae [37, 38], likely due to its multiple near-consensus -10 promoter
sequences.

were then used to insert the construct into a variant of the Tn7 delivery vector pTn7 xKS,
which also harbors a constitutively expressed dTomato gene for tracking all bacterial cells
(Fig. S7D) [16]. The resulting dual-reporter construct was then inserted into the ZWU0020
genome as previously described [16]. To verify reporter activity, disk diffusion assays were
performed on agar plates with the genotoxic agent mitomycin C and, as a control, the cell
wall-targeting beta-lactam antibiotic ampicillin (Fig. S7E). Mitomycin C induced robust
expression of sfGFP whereas ampicillin did not.

Growth kinetics: Growth kinetics of bacterial strains in vitro were measured using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader. Prior to growth measurements, bacteria were grown overnight
in 5 ml LB media at 30◦ C with shaking. The next day, cultures were diluted 1:100 into
fresh LB media with or without the indicated antibiotic and dispensed in quadruplicate (200
µl/well) into a sterile 96-well clear flat-bottom tissue culture-treated microplate. Absorbance
at 600 nm was then recorded every 30 min for ∼16 hours at 30◦ C with shaking. Growth
rates were estimated by fitting a logistic growth curve to OD values, starting at manually
defined points marking the end of lag phase.
Viability: Cultures of Vibrio ZWU0020 or Enterobacter ZOR0014 were grown overnight
in LB at 30◦ C with shaking. The next day, 1:100 dilutions were made in fresh LB media
containing either ciprofloxacin (Vibrio: 10 ng/ml, Enterobacter : 25 ng/ml) or no drug.
Cultures were incubated at 30◦ C with shaking for 6 hours prior to being stained using
a LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Culture/stain mixtures were diluted 1:10 in 0.7% saline and imaged using a Leica MZ10
F fluorescence stereomicroscope equipped with a 2.0X objective and a Leica DFC365 FX
camera. Images were captured using standard Leica Application Suite software. Bacteria
were identified in images with intensity-based region finding following difference of gaussians
filtering. Cells stained in both SYTO9 and propidium iodide were identified as overlapping
regions in the two color channels. Analysis code was written in MATLAB.

Cell length and swimming speed : Dense overnight cultures of Vibrio ZWU0020 were diluted
1:100 in fresh LB media alone or with 10 ng/ml ciprofloxacin and incubated at 30◦ C with
shaking for 4 h. Bacteria were then imaged on a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescence microscope between a slide and a coverslip using a 60X oil immersion objective and a Hamamatsu
ORCA CCD camera (Hamamatsu City, Japan). Movies were taken within 60 seconds of
mounting at an exposure time of 30 ms, resulting in a frame rate of 15 frames/sec, and
had a duration of approximately 7 seconds. Bacteria in the resulting movies were identified with intensity-based region finding and tracked using nearest-neighbor linking. Analysis
code was written in MATLAB. Five movies were taken per treatment case. For untreated
length analysis, n = 2291 bacteria were quantified; for ciprofloxacin-treated length analysis,
n = 963. For untreated speed analysis, n = 833 bacteria; for ciprofloxacin-treated speed
analysis, n = 531.

Vibrio SOS reporter activity: Vibrio ZWU0020 carrying the fluorescent SOS reporter was
grown overnight in LB at 30◦ C with shaking. The next day, 1:100 dilutions were made
in fresh LB media containing either 10 ng/ml ciprofloxacin, 400 ng/ml mitomycin C, 10
µg/ml ampicillin, or no drug. Cultures were then grown overnight (∼16 h) at 30◦ C with
shaking. The next day, cultures were diluted 1:43 in 80% glycerol (as an immobilizing agent)
and imaged with a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope equipped with an Andor iXon3 888
camera using a 40x objective and 1.5x zoom. Bacteria were identified in images with gradientbased region finding, using a Sobel filter, following difference of gaussians filtering. Analysis
code was written in MATLAB. As expected, the two DNA targeting drugs, ciprofloxcain
and mitomycin C, induced the SOS response in subpopulations of cells, while the cell-wall
targeting drug ampicillin did not. In computing SOS-positive fractions, filamented cells were
counted as single cells.

Dissection of larval guts was done as described previously [42]. Dissected guts were harvested
and placed in a 1.6 ml tube containing 500 µl sterile 0.7% saline and ∼100 µl 0.5 mm zirconium oxide beads. Guts were then homogenized using a bullet blender tissue homogenizer
for ∼25 seconds on power 4. Lysates were serially plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) and
incubated overnight at 30◦ C prior to enumeration of CFU and determination of bacterial
load. Typically an overnight incubation is sufficient to recover all viable cells; however, we
note that ciprofloxacin treatment results in delayed colony growth on agar plates (likely
due to growth arrest induced by DNA-damage). We empirically determined that, in the
case of ciprofloxacin treatment, an incubation period 72 hours was required for complete
resuscitation of viable cells on agar plates. For all culture-based quantification of bacterial
populations in this study, the estimated limit of detection is 5 bacteria/gut and the limit of
quantification is 100 bacteria/gut. Plating data plotted are pooled from a minimum of two
independent experiments. Samples with zero countable colonies on the lowest dilution were
set to the limit of detection prior to plotting and statistical analysis. Enumeration of flask
water abundances by plating was performed identically to gut abundances, including the 72

Comparing antibiotic treatments between intestinal populations and flask water populations:
To compare the effect of ciprofloxacin on populations in the intestine and in the flask water,
we normalized treated abundances by the corresponding untreated median abundance (Fig.
2C and 3A). To control for variation in untreated bacterial dynamics between weekly batches
of fish, we performed the normalization within each batch. Unnormalized data is available
in the Supplemental Data File.

Imaging intestinal bacteria: Live imaging of larval zebrafish was performed using a custombuilt light sheet fluorescence microscope previously described in detail [43]. Larvae are
anesthetized with MS-222 (Tricane) and mounted into small glass capillaries containing
0.5% agarose gel by means of a metal plunger. Larvae are then suspended vertically in an
imaging chamber filled with embryo media and anesthetic and extruded out of the capillary
such that the set agar plug sits in front of the imaging objective. The full intestine volume
(∼1200 × 300 × 150 microns) is imaged in four subregions that are registered in software
after imaging. The imaging of a full intestine volume sampled at 1-micron steps between
z-planes is imaged in ∼45 seconds. Excitation lasers at 488 and 561 nm wavelengths were
tuned to a power of 5 mW prior to entering the imaging chamber. A 30 ms exposure time
was used for all 3D scans and 2D movies. Time lapse imaging was performed overnight,
except for the 3.5 hour imaging of Enterobacter (Fig. 3C), which occurred during the day.

Viability staining of expelled aggregates: Germ-free larval zebrafish were colonized with wild
type Vibrio or Enterobacter (without fluorescent markers) for 24 hours and then mounted
into agarose plugs using small glass capillaries identically to the imaging procedure (above).
Individual capillaries were suspended into isolated wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate filled
with embryo media containing anesthetic or anesthetic + ciprofloxacin (10 ng/ml for Vibrio,
25 ng/ml for Enterobacter ) and the larvae were extruded from the capillaries. Fish remained
mounted for 24 hours, during which expelled bacteria remained caught in the agarose plug.
After treatment, fish were pulled back into the capillaries and transferred to smaller wells
of a 96 well plate containing embryo media, anesthetic, and the LIVE/DEAD BacLight
Bacterial Viability stains SYTO9 and propridium iodide. Fish were stained according to kit
instructions, with the exception of the incubation period being extended from 15 to 30 min
to account for potential issues with the aggregate nature of the cells [44]. Following staining,
fish were pulled again into the capillaries and transferred to the light sheet microscope for
imaging. As shown in Figures S4 and S10, zebrafish cells stain in addition to bacterial cells,
precluding accurate quantification of viable fractions.

Image analysis

596

Bacteria were identified in three-dimensional light sheet fluorescence microscopy images using
a custom MATLAB analysis pipeline previously described [43, 10], with minor changes.
In brief, small objects (single cells and small aggregates) are identified using difference of
Gaussians filtering. False positives are rejected with a combination of intensity thresholding
(mostly noise) and manual removal (mostly host cells). Large aggregates are identified with
a graph cut algorithm [45] that is seeded with either an intensity-based mask or a gradientbased mask. The average intensity of a single cell is estimated as the mean intensity of small
objects, which is then used to estimate the number of cells contained in larger clusters by
normalizing the total fluorescence intensity of each cluster. Spatial distributions along the
length of the gut are computed using a manually drawn line drawn that defines the gut’s
center axis.

Choosing rate kernels: Our approach to choosing the size dependence of the rate parameters
was to pick the simplest kernels consistent with key experimental observations. The first key
observation, made in past work [43, 15], was that in between the expulsion of large aggregates
population growth is well-described by a deterministic logistic function. Therefore, we chose
a logistic growth kernel. The second key observation was that we occasionally encountered
populations consisting of just a single, large aggregate and many single cells (Fig. S9E),
which suggests that active fragmentation of single cells, most likely during growth phases,
is the dominant fragmentation process. This notion is supported by time-lapse images of
initial growth (Supplemental Movie 9) that depicts the creation of single cells during growth,
in addition to the growth of three dimensional aggregates. Based on these observations,
we made the assumption that single cell fragmentation is the sole fragmentation process,
leading to what is known in other contexts as a “chipping” kernel [28]. Beyond the chipping
assumption, we had little evidence that informed how single cell fragmentation depends on
the size of the aggregate, so we opted for the simplest choice of a constant, size-independent
rate. Similarly for aggregation and expulsion, the size dependence of the rates is likely
determined by complicated and uncharacterized fluid mechanical interactions of bacterial
clusters in peristaltic-like flow, which we parsimoniously replace with a simple constant kernel
for both processes. In aggregated populations, since it is only the loss of the largest clusters
(of size O(K)) that significantly impacts the system, we expect that it is the expulsion rate
for these largest clusters that matters, rather than how the expulsion rate scales with cluster
size. To test this notion, we ran simulations in which the expulsion rate scaled as a power
of the cluster size, n, according to λ(n) = λ(n/K)ν , and varied the exponent ν. This ansatz
keeps the expulsion rate of clusters of size K fixed for all values of ν. The result is that
the cluster size distribution does not change within uncertainty values (Fig. S13), indicating
that this approximation is valid.

623

For reference, we note that with these choices the model can be summarized by the following

The four rate parameters are α (aggregation), β (fragmentation), r (growth), and λ (expulsion), and K is the carrying capacity. In the last term of the first line, δn,1 is the Kronecker
delta with second argument equal to 1. Of note, the first line of equation (1), containing just
aggregation and fragmentation terms, was previously studied as a model of polymer chains
and was shown to exhibit interesting non-equilibrium steady states and scaling behaviors
that are due to the breaking of detailed balance by the chipping kernel [29]. In our system
detailed balance is also broken, but for a different reason: our “monomers”—single cells—are
alive and self-replicating.
Simulations: As each zebrafish intestine contains at most a few hundred bacterial clusters,
finite size effects and stochasticity impact cluster statistics, so we implemented the model
as a hybrid deterministic-stochastic simulation that follows the time evolution of individual
clusters. Gillespie’s direct method [46] was used to simulate stochastic aggregation, fragmentation, and expulsion events. Growth was treated as deterministic. Once the time until next
stochastic reaction, τ , was determined according to the Gillespie algorithm, integration was
performed with the Euler method from time t to t + τ using a time step ∆t = min(τ, 0.1 hr).
To simulate Vibrio populations, direct stochastic simulation becomes intractable due to the
large number of clusters (∼ 105 single cells). We therefore implemented a modified tauleaping algorithm [47] that facilitates large simulations. We opted for a straightforward
fixed τ method and empirically determined that a value of τ = 0.001 h produced no observable differences in cluster size and abundance distributions compared to direct stochastic
simulation (Supp Fix X A,B).

The kinetic model presented in the main text has 5 parameters: rates of growth, expulsion,
aggregation, and fragmentation, along with an overall carrying capacity. As discussed in the
main text, we directly measured Enterobacter ’s growth rate and expulsion rate through timelapse imaging. The uncertainty of the expulsion rate was estimated by the standard error,

For the remaining parameters, we developed a method to infer them from the distribution
of abundances obtained from dissection and plating assays. In a regime where aggregation
and fragmentation are fast compared to expulsion, we expect the system to locally reach a
quasi-steady state in between expulsions of the largest aggregates. As such, we expect cluster
statistics to depend primarily on the ratio of fragmentation to aggregation, β/α, rather than
on each rate independently. This confirmed in simulations (Fig. S11A and S11B). Therefore,
the number of parameters to be estimated is reduced to two: β/α and K.
Untreated Enterobacter : We fixed α = 0.1 hr−1 and performed a grid search in β and K on a
logarithmic grid, simulating the model multiple trials for each pair of (β, K). The number of
trials decreased with increasing β, from 1000 to 10. Each simulation started from 10 single
cells and ran for a simulated time of 64 hours, modeling our 72 hour colonization data with
an 8 hour colonization window. To model static host-host variation, we drew each carrying
capacity from a log-normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.5 decades. This is
the standard deviation of the untreated Vibrio abundance distribution (Fig. S3F), which is
an appropriate measure of static host-host variation because untreated Vibrio does not form
large aggregates and therefore does not experience large, stochastic population collapses due
to aggregate expulsion. We then compared the mean (µ) and variance (σ) of the simulated,
log-transformed abundances log10 (N + 1) with the values for our plating data (µ̂ and σ̂,
respectively), quantifying error using
χ2 = (µ − µ̂)2 + (σ − σ̂)2 .

A heat map of χ2 shows well-defined edges for the minimum values of the fit parameters (Fig.
S11C). However, the inference is poorly constrained for carrying capacities larger than 105
and for log10 β/α greater than 2.5. This poor constraint is due primarily to the insensitivity
of the abundance distribution to increasing values of these parameters. For example, moving
to the far right side of the abundance phase diagram in Fig. 5B, the contours become flat
in β/α.
To further constrain our estimates, we place upper bounds on these parameters with simple
estimates of physical limits. To bound the carrying capacity, we note that a larval zebrafish
intestine have a volume of roughly 1 nl, or 106 µm3 . Taking the volume of a bacterium to be
roughly 1 µm3 , we estimate a maximum bacterial load of 106 cells, consistent with the largest
Vibrio abundances (Fig. S3F). As we find no Enterobacter populations above 105.5 , and in
our simulations we draw carrying capacities from a log-normal distribution with a standard
deviation of half a decade, we constrained our best fit estimate to log10 K = 5.0. To bound

the fragmentation rate, β, we considered the time-lapse movie that showcases the greatest
degree of cluster fragmentation observed (Supplemental Movie 9). This movie depicts the
initial growth phase, in which both the size of aggregates and the number of single cells
increase. Because the aggregates visibly grow in size, we know that the fragmentation rate
must be bounded by the absolute growth rate of the population, β < rN ; if the fragmentation
rate were larger, cells would break off of the aggregate faster than they would be produced
by cell division, and the aggregates would shrink in size. Taking, roughly, r ∼ 10−1 and
N ∼ 103 (Fig. 4D), we estimate that β < 102 , or, with α = 10−1 , β/α < 103 . With this
bound, we constrain our best fit estimate to log10 β/α = 2.5. We took the uncertainties of
the best fit estimates, σlog10 K and σlog10 β/α , to be the inverse of the local curvatures of χ2 at
the best fit values: σθ = 1/|∂θ2 χ2 |, for θ = log10 K, log10 β/α, resulting in σlog10 K = 0.5 and
σlog10 K = 0.4.
Ciprofloxacin-treated Enterobacter : To estimate the change in Enterobacter ’s parameters
upon antibiotic treatment, we conservatively assumed equal effects on growth and fragmentation/aggregation and modeled treatment parameters as r0 = r and β 0 = β. We then
performed a single parameter grid search of  values, ranging from 10−1.75 to 10−0.5 . We
modeled the antibiotic treatment as a parameter quench with a 6 hour buffer time, in which
the antibiotics entered the intestine and began to take action on the bacteria. The value of
6 hours was chosen based on the Vibrio time series data. Each simulation was initialized
with a cluster configuration drawn randomly from the imaging-derived dataset of actual untreated Enterobacter populations. The parameters r, λ, and K were set to their best fit or
measured values, α was again fixed at 0.1 hr−1 , and r and β were both scaled by the same
factors of . We then ran simulations for a modified simulation time 24 − 6 = 18 hours and
fit the mean and standard deviation of shifted log-transformed abundances measured in the
24 hour treatment plating assays. A plot of χ2 vs  shows a clear minimum at  = 10−1 (Fig.
S11D).
Untreated Vibrio: Untreated Vibrio populations are comprised of almost entirely single cells
and therefore represent an extreme limit of the kinetic model. In this regime, fragmentation
is so thorough that even dividing cells immediately separate and there is no appreciable
aggregation. Because multicellular clusters are extremely rare, our data are insufficient to
extract numerical estimates of model parameters. However, one can estimate a lower bound
for the fragmentation rate, β, by equating it to the total growth rate, rN , where N is the
total population size; i.e. clusters do not grow without fragmenting. This estimate yields
β & 105 . For the expulsion rate, if we assume the same rate as Enterobacter (positing
unchanged intestinal mechanics), we obtain r/λ ∼ 7 These values place untreated Vibrio
off-scale in the phase diagram of Fig. 5B.
Ciprofloxacin-treated Vibrio: We performed a two-parameter fit to (β/α, r), using the measured expulsion rate for Enterobacter (λ = 0.11 h−1 and the typical untreated Vibrio abundance for a carrying capacity of K ∼ 105 . We observed that in approaching the extinction
transition from above, simulated abundance distributions transition from unimodal to bimodal in shape, with a peak emerging near N = 0 representing populations that suffered
large, abrupt collapses. As such, fitting just the mean and variance as was done for Enter26

obacter produced inaccurate estimates. Therefore, we implemented full maximum likelihood
estimation using 100 simulated replicates to estimate the likelihood. While the fit to treated
Vibrio resulted in less-constrained parameter estimates in the r−β plane compared to the Enterobacter fit, it did yield a clear maximum (Fig. S12C) and a best-fit abundance distribution
that matched experimental data within uncertainties (Fig. S12D). Like with Enterobacter,
we can attempt to assess the validity of this model by comparing the now-parameter-free
prediction of the cluster size distribution with the image-derived data. Due to the rarity of
large clusters and to limited data, the experimental distribution is severely undersampled.
It shows, however, qualitative agreement with the model prediction (Fig. S12E). Finally, to
confirm that our choice of the simulation timestep τ did not affect our parameter estimation,
we decreased τ by a factor of 2 from 0.001 h to 0.0005 h and found no change in the best-fit
cluster size distribution within sampling uncertainties (Fig. S12F). Because our parameter
grid used in the fit was coarse, we estimate the uncertainty of our best-fit parameters as the
grid spacing. Our uncertainty values are therefore likely overestimated.

Alignment of 100bp recN promoter region plus start codon of the V. cholerae consensus
recN promoter, Aeromonas veronii (zebrafish isolate, IMG gene ID: 2526373590, locus tag:
L972 03073), and E. coli HS (human commensal isolate IMG gene ID: 640921890, locus tag:
EcHS A2774). For panels A and B, SOS boxes are shaded based on their conservation to the
consensus gammaproteobacterial sequence (CTGTN8 ACAG); ‘ATG’ start codons are bolded;
putative ribosome binding sites are boxed; and putative, near-consensus -10 promoter sequences (TATAAT) are bolded and underlined. C: Schematic of recN -based fluorescent SOS
reporter. Promoter comprises the consensus V. cholerae recN promoter region (PrecN ),
which was derived from the sequence alignment in panel A. The synthetic 5’ untranslated
region (UTR) contains an epsilon enhancer and consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The
open reading frame (ORF) encodes superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). And the 3’
UTR contains the synthetic transcriptional terminator L3S2P21. D: Schematic of assembled
SOS reporter in the context of the Tn7 tagging construct. Tn7 L and Tn7 R inverted repeats
flank the Tn7 transposon. The SOS reporter was inserted upstream of a dTomato gene that
is constitutively expressed from a synthetic Ptac promoter. A gene encoding gentamicin
resistance (gentR) was used to facilitate genetic manipulation. E: Disk diffusion assays verifying SOS reporter activity. Vibrio ZWU0020 carrying the SOS reporter was spread onto
agar plates using glass beads at a density that would give rise to a lawn of growth. Circular
disks of Whatman filter paper (amber dashed lines) loaded with either the genotoxic agent
mitomycin C or the cell wall-targeting beta-lactam antibiotic ampicillin were then placed in
the center of the agar plates. After overnight incubation at 30◦ C, plates were imaged using
a fluorescence stereomicroscope. In the presence of mitomycin C, cells adjacent to the zone
of inhibition (i.e., the area where there is no bacterial growth) robustly expressed sfGFP
whereas in the presence of ampicillin they did not.

of 3D images stacks. The field of view is around the vent region, as shown in the fish
schematic at the top of the figure. The approximate boundary of the fish is indicated by
the dashed orange line. Zebrafish cells also stain and constitute the bulk of the fluorescence
in the images. Examples of zebrafish cells are indicated by white arrow heads. Examples of

Additional model details A-B: Simulated heatmap of mean (A) and standard deviation
(B) of log10 (abundance + 1) for varying values of aggregation and fragmentation rates. Both
mean and standard deviation depend primarily on the ratio of fragmentation to aggregation
rates, rather than on each rate independently. Dashed magenta line in (A) represents α =
β. Parameters: r = 0.27 hr−1 , λ = 0.11 hr−1 , K = 105 , simulation time = 64 hours,
number of trials decreased logarithmically with β from 1000 to 10. Units of α and β are
hr−1 . C: Heatmap of χ2 for untreated Enterobacter fit to 7 dpf abundances (Materials
and Methods). Parameters: r = 0.27 hr−1 , λ = 0.11 hr−1 , α = 0.1 hr−1 , simulation time
= 64 hours, number of trials decreased logarithmically with β from 1000 to 10. D: χ2
for fit to 6 dpf ciprofloxacin-treated Enterobacter abundances as a function of the scaling
parameter , which scales the growth and fragmentation rates simultaneously according to
r → r and β → β. A clear minimum is seen at  = 0.1. Parameters: r = 0.27 hr−1 ,
λ = 0.11 hr−1 , α = 0.1 hr−1 , β = 101.5 hr−1 , simulation time = 64 hours, number of trials
decreased logarithmically with β from 1000 to 10. E: 3D phase diagram of log10 (abundance+
1) with axes fragmentation/aggregation (β/α), growth rate (r), and expulsion rate (λ).
Blue isosurface represents log10 (abundance + 1) = 0.5 ± 0.5, yellow isosurface represents
log10 (abundance + 1) = 5.5 ± 0.5. Parameters: α = 0.1 hr−1 , simulation time = 64 hours,
number of trials decreased logarithmically with β from 1000 to 10. Units of α and β are
hr−1 . F: Slices through the 3D phase diagram in (E) for different values of λ.

Tau leaping simulations and Vibrio parameter inference. A-B: Comparison of direct
stochastic simulation (“ssa”, gray circles) and our fixed-tau leaping (“tau”, purple diamonds)
algorithm with τ = 0.001 h. Simulations using both methods were run with the best-fit
parameters for untreated Enterobacter and 100 replicates. Both the cluster size distribution
(A) and abundance histogram (B) show excellent agreement between the two methods. CE: Details of model fit to ciprofloxacin-treated Vibrio 24 h abundances. C: Heat map of
log-likelihood. A manual grid search was performed over growth rate (r) and fragmentation
rate (β). D: Comparison of the best-fit abundance distribution (purple line) to experimental
data (blue circles). E: Comparison of the predicted cluster size distribution (purple line) to
experimental data (blue circles). Here, all model parameters were fixed at their previously
determined, best-fit values; there were no additional free parameters. The experimental
data distribution is severely undersampled, estimated from just 4 fish. F: Confirmation
that the best-fit solution is independent of our choice of τ , indicating that simulations were
performed with sufficient resolution. Simulations were run with the best-fit parameters but
with τ decreased by a factor of 2, from τ = 0.001 h (purple circles) to τ = 0.0005 h (green
diamonds). Distributions agree with one another within sampling uncertainties.

Model cluster size distributions are independent of how expulsion rate scales
with cluster size. Simulations were run with the expulsion rate depending on cluster size
according to En = λ(n/K)ν , with K the carrying capacity, and the exponent ν was varied.
This ansatz keeps the expulsion rate of clusters of size K constant. The resulting cluster size
distributions agree with one another within sampling uncertainties, which are smaller than
the marker size. This result justifies our use of the simple constant form of the expulsion
kernel, En = λ.

Light sheet fluorescence microscopy movie of untreated Vibrio swimming in a 6 dpf zebrafish
gut. The density of cells is highest on the left (anterior), where single cells cannot be resolved
and the population appears as a single bright region (see also Figure 1C). On the right
(posterior), single cells are more easily resolved and are seen swimming in and out of the
intestinal folds. Each frame is from the same optical plane. Scale bar = 50 µm.
