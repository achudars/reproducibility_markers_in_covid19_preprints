ABSTRACT

31

Live-cell imaging of mitochondrial function and dynamics can provide vital insights into both

32

physiology and pathophysiology, including of metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes. However,

33

without super-resolution microscopy and commercial analysis software it is challenging to

34

accurately extract features from dense multi-layered mitochondrial networks, such as those in

35

insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells. Motivated by this, we developed a comprehensive pipeline,

36

and associated ImageJ plugin, that enables 2D/3D quantification of mitochondrial network

37

morphology and dynamics in mouse β-cells, and by extension other similarly challenging cell-

38

types. The approach is based on standard confocal microscopy and shareware, making it widely

39

accessible. The pipeline was validated using mitochondrial photo-labelling and unsupervised

40

cluster analysis, and is capable of morphological and functional analyses on a per-organelle basis,

41

including in 4D (xyzt). Overall, this tool offers a powerful framework for multiplexed analysis of

42

mitochondrial state/function, and provides a valuable resource to accelerate mitochondrial research

43

in health and disease.

INTRODUCTION

46

Mitochondria are the main energy producing organelle of eukaryotic cells and are essential for a

47

diverse range of cellular functions, including ATP synthesis, Ca2+ homeostasis, ROS signaling,

48

and the control of apoptotic cell death (1, 2). Microscopy has been instrumental in unraveling

49

intricacies of mitochondrial biology and their diverse roles in cellular physiology and

50

pathophysiology. Electron microscopy has provided fundamental insights into mitochondrial

51

ultrastructure and cellular distribution in health and disease but requires cell fixation and only

52

provides a static snapshot. In contrast, fluorescence microscopy of live cells, labeled with

53

mitochondria-targeted fluorescent proteins or dyes, has revealed that mitochondria are highly

54

dynamic and motile organelles that undergo frequent fusion and fission events (3-5).

55

Mitochondrial dynamics and network morphology vary in different cellular states, and are

56

important for the function and quality control of the organelle, as well as overall cell health and

57

adaptation to stress (1). Healthy mitochondria are generally mobile, tubular in shape and exist in

58

complex networks, whereas cells undergoing profound stress or entering apoptosis often display

59

swollen and fragmented mitochondria, marked by concurrent disruption of metabolism, membrane

60

potential, ROS levels, and Ca2+ signalling (6-8). Quantitative imaging-based assessment of

61

mitochondrial morphology and dynamics can therefore provide valuable insights into cellular

62

physiology and pathophysiology.

63

In pancreatic β-cells, mitochondria play an essential role in insulin secretion, which relies

64

on ATP and other mitochondria-derived metabolites to both trigger and amplify insulin granule

65

exocytosis in response to glucose and other nutrient stimuli (9). Dysfunction of β-cell mitochondria

66

therefore results in loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (10). Perturbations to mitochondria

67

are also a common feature in insulin target tissues with impaired insulin signaling (11, 12).

68

Mitochondria thus take center stage in both β-cell failure and insulin resistance and are an area of

69

significant focus in efforts to understand the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (13-15).

70

Mitochondria also exist as dynamic networks in β-cells. Fusion within the network may help

71

protect β-cells from nutrient stress-induced apoptosis (6), and mitochondrial fragmentation,

72

swelling and dysfunction are seen in β-cells from patients with type 2 diabetes and rodent models

73

of diabetes (15-18). Normal insulin secretion may also be influenced by β-cell mitochondrial

74

dynamics (19-21), but exactly how networking of the organelle relates to its metabolic capacity in

75

healthy β-cells or during conditions of moderate nutrient excess remains unclear and warrants

76

further investigation.

77

Most types of microscopy can detect the prominent morphological differences between

78

healthy and severely stressed mitochondria with relative ease. It is, however, much more

79

challenging to accurately quantify subtle changes in mitochondrial dynamics, or perform 3D

80

analysis of the full mitochondrial network. This is particularly difficult in cells with a dense

81

mitochondrial network that spans several layers, such as β-cells (6, 18). Although methods have

82

been published that integrate 3D confocal imaging and analysis of mitochondria, these generally

83

use commercial software packages and/or are optimized for relatively flat cell types (22, 23). This

84

is likely one reason why there are only few quantitative analyses of β-cell mitochondrial dynamics,

85

and why full 3D investigations of β-cell mitochondria are limited to a small number of examples

86

using super-resolution approaches, such as 4π-microscopy (18, 24).

87

To facilitate progress in the important area of mitochondrial biology and dynamics we

88

present here a pipeline for quantitative multidimensional analysis of mitochondria that is based on

89

standard confocal fluorescence microscopy and the open source image analysis platform

90

ImageJ/Fiji (25, 26). In this, we identify a superior method for accurate identification of individual

91

mitochondria within dense networks, and we outline a framework for quantitative description of

92

mitochondrial morphology and network characteristics. Applying this pipeline to clonal MIN6 β-

93

cells and primary mouse β-cells, we quantitatively distinguish mitochondrial morphologies,

94

including the functional and morphological changes to physiological and pathophysiological

95

stimuli. Additionally, we discuss the pros and cons of 2D and 3D imaging approaches, identify

96

image processing steps required for accurate mitochondrial analysis in 3D, and apply these to

97

quantitate distinct 3D β-cell network morphologies. Finally, we extend our analysis to 4D by

98

including time-lapse data, and we demonstrate the feasibility of using the pipeline to quantitate the

99

dynamics of the entire three-dimensional mitochondrial network in live cells.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

102

Overall workflow & general considerations

103

Fluorescence confocal analysis of mitochondria in live cells involves several general steps, each

104

of which is important for high-quality results (Figure 1). As a starting point, the cells must be

105

cultured on glass coverslips, or other vessels, that are appropriate for confocal microscopy. The

106

mitochondria should then be labelled using carefully chosen mitochondria-targeted fluorescent

107

proteins or organic dyes (27), and the image acquisition should be optimized and carried out in a

108

manner that provides sufficiently high resolution and image quality for accurate analysis. Because

109

these factors and general steps can vary between specific experiments and microscope systems, an

110

extensive discussion falls beyond the scope of this paper. The imaging parameters and conditions

111

we have used are detailed in Materials and Methods. Our focus in the following will be on the

112

post-acquisition steps that are critical for accurate morphological analysis of mitochondria in the

113

confocal images.

114

Image acquisition and analysis can be done in 2D or 3D, and by further extending this to

115

include time-lapse capture, important information can be extracted about mitochondrial dynamics.

116

The choice between these imaging modes may be influenced by several considerations, including

117

the type and thickness of the cell, the specific parameters to be quantified, and the biological

118

questions being asked. For instance, we will discuss later how some 2D analyses of relatively thick

119

cells, such as pancreatic β-cells, can be associated with inaccuracies that may be mitigated by a

120

full 3D analysis of the mitochondrial network. In all cases, accurate quantification of mitochondrial

121

features involves image processing steps and identification of the mitochondrial objects in the

122

image. Morphological features can then be extracted using appropriate 2D or 3D shape descriptors,

123

while mitochondrial networking can be assessed through skeletonization analysis. In this latter

124

process, the binarized mitochondria are converted into topological skeletons (the thinnest form

125

that is equidistant to its edges) and the branches of the skeleton are analyzed. In the following, we

126

describe each of these post-acquisition steps and identify a number of “best approaches”, to build

127

a pipeline for accurate multidimensional analysis of mitochondria that we also implement and

128

make available in a comprehensive Mitochondria Analyzer plugin for ImageJ/Fiji (28).

129
130

Image thresholding and identification of mitochondria

131

Before accurate morphological analysis of fluorescently–labeled mitochondria can be done, it is

132

essential that: i) the mitochondrial population is correctly identified in the images, and ii) the

133

individual mitochondrial units can be distinguished within the dense mitochondrial network. For

134

this critical step, a thresholding process based on analysis of the intensity histogram is used to

135

distinguish pixels with “true” fluorescent signal from background signal. This process also groups

136

any identified positive pixels that are connected into discrete objects (i.e. mitochondria) that can

137

be analyzed further. Thresholding approaches can be broadly categorized as either ‘Global’ or

138

‘Local’, which identify positive pixels based on the histogram of the entire image or on dynamic

139

analyses of image sub-regions, respectively (22, 29). Global thresholding tends to be the most

140

commonly used approach, but this may reflect its relative ease of use rather than accuracy.

141

To identify the most suitable thresholding strategy for mitochondrial identification, we

142

compared the performance of the Global and Local threshold methods available for ImageJ/Fiji on

143

images of primary islet cells stained with MitoTracker dye. This was judged on the ability to

144

preserve mitochondrial structural detail while minimizing capture of background signal. For

145

optimal results, all images were pre- and post-processed to reduce noise (see Materials &

146

Methods). Among the Global-based algorithms in the ImageJ/Fiji “Auto Threshold” command,

147

we qualitatively estimated that the Default method performs similar to, or in several cases better

148

than, the other Global algorithms (Figure S1).

149

The Local thresholding methods we tested included the Mean, Median, and Mid-grey

150

algorithms (part of the “Auto Local Threshold” command), as well as the Weighted Mean method

151

(also called Adaptive threshold), which is available through a separate plugin (30) (Figure S2).

152

These Local methods compute a threshold for each pixel in the image and require the definition of

153

two parameters: a block size and a C-value. The block size specifies the size of the region around

154

each pixel for which the histogram is analyzed and should be chosen based on the size of the

155

objects of interest for the best results (30). The C-value provides an offset to the threshold and

156

helps strike a balance between minimizing noise detection and incorrectly splitting objects into

157

smaller pieces (30, 31). Using the Adaptive threshold method for optimization, we found that the

158

ideal C-value depended on the image’s signal-to-noise contrast and needed to be empirically

159

determined. For each set of images that has been acquired and processed in a similar manner, we

160

therefore recommend that various combinations of block size and C-values should be tested on a

161

representative image to determine the best combination. The optimized parameters can then be

162

used to threshold all images in the group similarly (Figure S2, Supplemental Methods for details).

163

Among the Local threshold approaches, our assessment was that the Mean and Adaptive threshold

164

methods best captured mitochondrial structure, and that the Adaptive threshold further tended to

165

identify less noise (Figure S2B).

166

A side-by-side comparison indicated that Local (Adaptive) thresholding resolves

167

mitochondria better than Global thresholding, which appears to capture more out-of-focus signal

168

and/or noise, and therefore erroneously merges adjacent objects (Figures 2A & B). For a more

169

stringent and quantitative evaluation, we used mitochondria-targeted photoactivatable GFP (mito-

170

PAGFP) to selectively photo-label single mitochondria and identify truly contiguous organelles

171

within dense regions of the network (4, 5). As exemplified in Figure 2B, and quantified in Figure

172

2C (see also Figure S3), Adaptive thresholding was indeed better at delineating photo-labeled

173

mitochondria, and distinguishing closely adjacent parts of the network that are physically separate.

174

In contrast, the Global threshold algorithm consistently overestimated the mitochondrial size.

175

Taken together, these comparisons established that using Adaptive thresholding, with empirically

176

optimized parameter values, is a superior approach for accurate identification of fluorescently

177

labeled β-cell mitochondria.

178
179

Two-dimensional analysis of mitochondrial morphology and network connectivity

180

After careful image thresholding, the next step is to quantify the morphological features of the

181

identified mitochondrial objects. We therefore identified a comprehensive set of parameters to

182

capture and mathematically describe key aspects of the mitochondrial morphology. For 2D

183

analysis, we characterize mitochondrial size by area and perimeter, while mitochondrial shape is

184

defined by form factor (FF) and aspect ratio (AR). We evaluate the overall connectivity and

185

morphological complexity of the mitochondrial network based on the skeletonized network, and

186

quantify this by the number of branches, the number of branch junctions, as well as total

187

(accumulated) length of branches in the skeleton. Figure 3 summarizes the various parameters and

188

indicate how they change with various morphologies.

189

To evaluate the ability of this approach to measure and distinguish mitochondrial

190

morphologies, we transfected MIN6 cells with mito-YFP and generated an image-set consisting

191

of 2D slices from 84 cells. We then divided the cells into three different categories based on visual

192

inspection of their mitochondria: 1) a “fragmented” group, characterized by small round

193

mitochondria and little branching; 2) a “filamentous” group, with highly connected networks of

194

long/filamentous mitochondria; and 3) an “intermediate” group of cells, containing a mixture of

195

punctate and longer tubular mitochondria. As shown in Figure 4, analysis of the 2D images resulted

196

in quantitative morphological and networking parameters that differed significantly between the

197

three groups. Of note, a more in-depth comparison of the two shape descriptors revealed that FF

198

required smaller sample sizes than AR to detect differences between the three morphological sub7

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/687749; this version posted July 11, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

199

types, and seemed particularly well-suited for distinguishing between cells with filamentous and

200

intermediate mitochondrial morphologies (Figure S4). Likely, this is because AR only measures

201

elongation, whereas FF incorporates the perimeter and therefore is more sensitive to curvature and

202

the irregular shapes of filamentous mitochondria (Figure S4B). Collectively, these results

203

demonstrate that our combined approach for image processing, thresholding, and analysis enables

204

quantitative identification and comparison of mitochondrial morphological sub-types.

205
206

Validation of morphometric quantifications and classifications by unsupervised clustering

207

Next, we further tested our pipeline by using Spanning-tree Progression Analysis of Density-

208

normalized Events (SPADE) (32, 33) to obtain an unbiased classification of our test images. The

209

morphological parameters that had been calculated from our image set of 84 mito-YFP-expressing

210

MIN6 cells (shown in Figure 4) were loaded into SPADE, which used these to generate a

211

population tree in which each node represents a cell (Figure 5A). This SPADE tree was then

212

subdivided into 3 cell populations based on automatic classification of their mitochondrial features

213

(Figure 5A; see Materials and Methods for details). When images from each of the three SPADE-

214

identified groups were subsequently examined, the mitochondria in each group were noticeably

215

dissimilar in appearance (Figure 5B), and comparative analysis revealed that there were significant

216

differences in all the morphological descriptors (Figure 5C & D). The morphometric data indicated

217

that SPADE Subgroups 1, 2, and 3 corresponded to cells with filamentous, intermediate, and

218

fragmented mitochondria, respectively. This was confirmed by an 88% match between the

219

unsupervised SPADE clustering and our manual grouping of the cells. Together, these results

220

provide an unbiased validation of the applicability and robustness of our 2D pipeline for analysis

221

of mitochondrial network structure and complexity.

222
223

Limitations of 2D mitochondrial analysis

224

Our 2D analyses reliably measure mitochondrial morphology in an optical cross-section and can

225

provide valuable information regarding the state of the organelle. However, when cells are

226

relatively thick and tend to have a mitochondrial network that spans several layers, this approach

227

has its challenges and limitations. It is difficult to know if a given plane in a cell is truly

228

representative, and as illustrated by the green objects in Figure 6A the 2D appearance of a

229

mitochondrion will also depend on its orientation relative to the optical cross-section. Moreover,
8

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/687749; this version posted July 11, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not
certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. It is made available under
aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

230

a 2D image is unlikely to reveal the actual interconnectedness of the mitochondrial network. When

231

a mitochondrion spans multiple planes and intersects the focal cross-section at several points, it

232

can result in a notable misrepresentation of the morphology, as illustrated by the blue schematic

233

object in Figure 6A. That this also occurs in situ is demonstrated in the side-by-side 2D and 3D

234

visualization of a photo-labeled mitochondrion in Figure 6B & C. When viewed in 2D, the

235

localized photo-activation of mito-PAGFP seemed to label four small and distinct mitochondria

236

(Figure 6B; shown in green), but a full 3D reconstruction revealed that it was in fact one continuous

237

organelle (Figure 6C), consistent with diffusion-mediated distribution of GFP within the lumen.

238

Another inherent limitation of 2D analysis is that it does not allow direct quantitation of

239

the total mitochondrial mass. Cross-sectional area has been used to estimate mass in relatively flat

240

cells like neurons and fibroblasts where mitochondria are confined to a limited number of planes

241

(22, 34). However, this approximation is less appropriate for thicker cells, including β-cells. A

242

common alternative, intended to capture as much of the mitochondrial network as possible,

243

involves acquiring a stack of z-slices and projecting these into a single plane for faster and simpler

244

analysis (6, 23). Such projections contain information from the whole network, but in voluminous

245

cells this will erroneously merge overlapping mitochondria and produce indiscriminate clusters in

246

the resulting image.

247

As the importance of mitochondrial dynamics and its implication for cellular health and

248

disease has become more apparent, there is also an increasing need for more comprehensive

249

characterization of the organelle. Accordingly, there will inevitably be instances where the caveats

250

of 2D analysis we discussed above become restricting. To enable more precise quantification of

251

mitochondrial volume and network structure we therefore expanded our pipeline to include a

252

complete 3D representation and analysis.

253
254

Three-dimensional imaging and analysis of mitochondria

255

Full 3D reconstruction of mitochondria can be accomplished by taking a stack of serial slices

256

throughout the volume of the cell and integrating them with software such as ImageJ/Fiji.

257

However, there are technical challenges and constraints specifically associated with 3D imaging.

258

Foremost of these is that the maximum axial resolution (z-axis) of confocal microscopes is

259

approximately 500-800 nm, which is almost three times worse than the lateral (xy-plane) (35, 36).

260

As mitochondria are often less than 1 micron in diameter they approach this limit (18). This can
9

261

lead to a distorted appearance of imaged mitochondria, particularly in the z-axis where it causes

262

artificial stretching and blending of signal from objects in close vertical proximity to each other.

263

In the following section we discuss steps that can be taken to mitigate some of these caveats and

264

improve 3D results.

265
266

Image acquisition and processing requirements for accurate 3D analysis

267

An important first consideration when acquiring a stack of images for 3D analysis is the z-distance

268

between adjacent imaging planes. If the spacing is too large the final reconstruction will be

269

inaccurate. On the other hand, over-sampling will take unnecessary time, increase photo-toxicity,

270

and require additional resources for image storage and analysis. The distance between serial

271

sections should therefore be set according to the optimal Nyquist sampling rate, which provides

272

the ideal density of information to permit accurate digital reconstruction of an object (37). The

273

Nyquist distance can be calculated using online resources (38).

274

Even under optimal conditions, a confocal image will be affected by inherent diffraction-

275

induced distortion of the imaged object. This distortion can be represented by a point-spread

276

function (PSF) and then computationally corrected by using deconvolution algorithms. By

277

removing the effects of the PSF, the deconvolution process provides a more correct representation

278

of the underlying object and also helps eliminate out-of-focus light and/or noise in the image (36).

279

In Figure 7 we illustrate this and use the free DeconvolutionLab2 module for ImageJ/Fiji and the

280

commercial deconvolution software, Huygens Professional (SVI), to test the effect of

281

deconvolution on 3D-stacks of mitochondria (see Materials and Methods for details). As seen in

282

Figure 7A, mitochondria in the raw image stack have approximately 2-3x greater diameter in the

283

xz-view than in the xy-view, which illustrates the z-stretching. The deconvolution algorithms help

284

reduce this distortion, remove noise, and improve the contrast and separation of adjacent objects

285

(Figure 7A and Figure S5). In general, we found that the Huygens deconvolution package reduced

286

axial stretching more effectively than the ImageJ DeconvolutionLab2 module. By and large,

287

however, both deconvolution algorithms significantly increased the quality of 3D mitochondrial

288

network reconstructions compared to the raw confocal images (Figure 7B). Deconvolution also

289

affected subsequent 3D quantifications of mitochondrial number, shape, and size in a way that

290

indicated superior separation of individual mitochondria within the full population (Supplemental

291

Table 1; see discussion of the 3D analysis parameters below). In summary, these results

292

demonstrate that deconvolution of the raw confocal image stacks helps mitigate limitations of 3D

293

imaging and is a necessary step for accurate reconstruction and quantification of the full

294

mitochondrial network.

295
296

Three-dimensional quantification of mitochondrial morphology and network connectivity

297

When a high-quality representation of the full mitochondrial network has been generated,

298

ImageJ/Fiji can be used to extract information about the 3D morphology and connectivity by the

299

same general principles previously discussed for 2D. Mitochondrial size in 3D is represented by

300

volume and surface area, while shape is characterized by the sphericity of the mitochondrial object.

301

The complexity of the 3D network is quantified by the same branch parameters used for 2D (see

302

Figure 3 for a summary). Analogous to our 2D analyses, we evaluated our 3D approach by

303

generating a set of image stacks from mito-YFP-expressing MIN6 cells, and grouping these as

304

fragmented, filamentous, or intermediate based on the visual appearance of the reconstructured

305

mitochondrial networks (Figure 8A). Quantification using ImageJ/Fiji (See Figure 9 and Materials

306

& Methods for details) showed that the number of mitochondria per cell and their average

307

sphericity progressively increased, while the average mitochondrial volume decreased, as we move

308

from filamentous to intermediate to fragmented morphologies (Figure 8B). In contrast, the total

309

mitochondrial volume of each cell remained constant, highlighting that significant morphological

310

heterogeneity can occur independent of changes to mitochondrial mass (Figure 8B). In the

311

skeletonized network the number of branches and branch junctions progressively decreased,

312

illustrating that mitochondrial fragmentation, not surprisingly, is associated with a reduction in

313

overall network complexity (Figure 8C & D). Together, the above results and discussions

314

demonstrate how standard confocal imaging can be combined with ImageJ/Fiji-based processing

315

and analysis, to quantify volume, morphology, and connectivity of the entire mitochondrial

316

network in pancreatic β-cells. To our knowledge, full 3D characterization of live β-cell

317

mitochondria has previously only been done at this level using specialized super-resolution

318

imaging techniques (18, 24).

Pipeline Summary

321

Figure 9 illustrates the overall pipeline for 2D and 3D mitochondrial analysis. In summary, 2D

322

image slices or 3D image stacks are first acquired, and the latter deconvolved prior to analysis. In

323

ImageJ/Fiji, deconvolution of 3D stacks is done using the DeconvolutionLab2 module (39) and if

324

desired, the 3D stack can be visualized using the “3D Viewer” or “Volume Viewer” functions.

325

Alternatively, 3D deconvolution and visualization can be done using commercial software, such

326

as Huygens, if available to the user (Figure 7). For analysis, all images are then pre-processed

327

using the commands: “Subtract Background”, “Sigma Filter Plus”, “Enhance Local Contrast”, and

328

“Gamma Correction”. We then empirically test a range of block sizes and C-values for the

329

“Adaptive Threshold” command to establish the optimal values and use these as input when

330

applying the threshold algorithm. The resulting binarized images are post-processed using the

331

“Despeckle”, “Remove Outliers”, and “Fill 3D Holes” commands. At this stage, we recommend

332

comparing the final thresholded image to the original images as a quality control check of the

333

object identification and segmentation. The identified mitochondrial objects are then analyzed in

334

2D using “Analyze Particles”, which provides mitochondrial count, area, perimeter, form factor

335

(FF), and aspect ratio (AR). For 3D analysis, we use the “3D Object Counter” and “3D Particle

336

Analyzer” (from the MorphoLibJ package) commands to quantify count, volume, surface area,

337

and sphericity. The thresholded objects are then converted into skeletons using “Skeletonize

338

(2D/3D)”, and we apply the “Analyze Skeleton” command to obtain the number of skeletons,

339

number of branches, length of branches, and number of branch junctions in the 2D or 3D network.

340

Additional details and parameter values can be found in Materials and Methods.

341
342

Quantifying physiological and pathophysiological changes to mitochondrial morphology and

343

networking

344

Having established and validated the mitochondrial analysis pipeline, we next used it to

345

characterize mitochondrial changes under relevant physiological and pathophysiological

346

conditions. As a test of acute functional responses, primary mouse β-cells were cultured in either

347

basal (3 mM) or stimulatory (17 mM) glucose for 1 hour and co-stained with MitoTracker green

348

(MTG) and the mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye TMRE (Figure 10A). The MTG

349

fluorescence is insensitive to changes in mitochondrial polarization and served as the signal for

350

mitochondrial detection and morphological characterization (40). The TMRE intensity provided a

351

simultaneous readout of the activity of the individual mitochondrial units, and as expected

352

stimulatory glucose increases the TMRE/MTG intensity ratio (Figure 10B). By visual inspection

353

there were no obvious differences in mitochondrial morphology between the cells in low and high

354

glucose (Figure 10A), but quantitative analysis revealed a number of significant effects (Figure

355

10C & D). Despite no change to total mitochondrial area, glucose stimulation increased the number

356

of mitochondria, reduced their average size (area and perimeter) and made them more round

357

(decreased form factor); all of which suggests increased mitochondrial fission (Figure 10C). This

358

was further supported by skeletonization analysis, which showed that stimulatory glucose caused

359

an overall reduction in mitochondrial network connectivity (decreased branch parameters) (Figure

360

10D). This experiment agrees with previous reports linking drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission

361

to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (19, 20), and demonstrates that our analysis pipeline is

362

sensitive enough to allow quantitative detection of subtle physiological changes to mitochondrial

363

morphology and networking.

364

As an example of a full 3D application, we quantified the mitochondrial changes in

365

palmitate-treated MIN6 cells; an in vitro model of the β-cell lipotoxicity associated with obesity

366

and type 2 diabetes. As expected from previous 2D analyses (6) we observed a fragmentation of

367

the mitochondrial network following treatment with a high concentration of palmitate (Figure S6).

368

This pathophysiological stress response did not affect total mitochondrial volume but was clearly

369

reflected in all parameters describing the 3D shape and size of individual mitochondrial units

370

(Figure S6). Comparing the 2D morphological changes associated with 1 hour of glucose

371

stimulation and 6 hours of palmitate exposure, it is interesting to note that palmitate treatment

372

reduced AR by 26% and FF by 29%, while glucose stimulation only decreased AR and FF by 4%

373

and 12%, respectively. This suggests that physiological fission generates daughter mitochondria

374

that largely retain their shape, in contrast to the more pronounced stress-induced fragmentation,

375

which also causes a striking rounding of the smaller organelles.

376
377

Four-dimensional analysis of mitochondrial dynamics

378

At any given time, the overall structure of a mitochondrial network reflects the net balance of

379

fusion and fission between individual mitochondria. These are dynamic, energy-dependent,

380

processes that involve mitochondrial movement, and coordinated actions of proteins that mediate

381

fusion of the outer and inner membranes, or constriction and splitting of the organelle (2). Based

382

on static image analysis alone it can be difficult to know the reason for a change in morphometry.

383

For instance, a more connected and elongated network can be the result of an increase in fusion

384

events, a decrease in fission activity, or a combination of both. To further understand the
13

385

underlying changes, it can therefore be valuable to monitor mitochondrial movement,

386

morphological changes, and organelle interactions in real-time. In practical terms, this requires

387

that image acquisition can be repeated at sufficiently frequent intervals, and that the analysis is

388

extended to the time-domain. Previous studies have applied these principles to 2D images to

389

provide important insights regarding mitochondrial dynamics and turnover in pancreatic β-cells

390

(3, 6).

391

Here, we tested the feasibility of recording and quantifying the time-dependent dynamics

392

of the full 3D mitochondrial network (i.e. an extension to 4D analysis). For this, we expressed

393

mito-YFP in MIN6 cells and imaged these in a stage-top incubator on the confocal microscope.

394

3D time-lapse data were generated by acquiring z-stacks of the cells at regular time-intervals

395

(every 45 s) for a period of 30 minutes. At the 13-minute mark, we added a high concentration of

396

the mitochondrial uncoupling agent, FCCP, with the purpose of inducing a relatively rapid change

397

in mitochondrial dynamics and architecture. As seen in Figure 11 and Supplemental Video 1, the

398

FCCP triggered a rapid, and dramatic, loss of mitochondrial connectivity along with an increase

399

in the number of organelles. Interestingly, there was also a transient decrease in both average and

400

total mitochondrial volume, which indicates an initial contraction and shrinking of the

401

mitochondrial fragments followed by significant swelling; a known response to stress and osmotic

402

shock (41). The abrupt and severe deterioration of the mitochondrial network likely reflects the

403

induction of apoptosis due to profound damage from high levels of FCCP.

404

With this proof-of-principle experiment we have established the feasibility of analyzing

405

the temporal dynamics of a full mitochondrial network using standard confocal microscopy. A

406

powerful next step could be to combine this 4D approach with other tools such as photo-labeling

407

and tracking of individual organelles, to generate even more complete and in-depth knowledge of

408

the events that shape the mitochondrial network in health and disease.

409
410

CONCLUSION & PERSPECTIVES

411

Most aspects of cellular function and survival are linked to mitochondrial physiology or signals

412

originating from the organelle, and in these contexts the importance of mitochondrial morphology

413

and dynamics has become evident (1, 2). The integrity of the organelle itself, and by extension the

414

metabolic health of the cell, depends on the capacity for mitochondrial adaptation to stress and on

415

selective turnover of damaged parts of the network by mitophagy (3). These processes rely on

416

mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics, which require sensitive live-cell imaging approaches

417

to study (42). Our current understanding of mitochondrial dynamics in pancreatic β-cells has also

418

been based largely on such imaging approaches (3, 6). However, it is challenging to accurately

419

quantify β-cell mitochondrial morphometry and dynamics by fluorescence microscopy, and many

420

important questions remain unanswered.

421

In the previous sections, we established a comprehensive set of methods for quantitative

422

image analysis and ‘morphofunctional’ characterization of mitochondria based on standard

423

confocal microscopy and the ImageJ/Fiji shareware. The robustness of these approaches was

424

validated in several ways, including by unsupervised data clustering. We demonstrated the

425

applicability of the resulting pipeline for cells with dense multi-layered mitochondria by

426

conducting detailed 2D and 3D morphometric analyses of β-cells, and further extended these to

427

4D time-lapse imaging with the accuracy needed for quantitative assessment of network dynamics.

428

To help researchers implement these methods, we have also built our analysis pipeline into a plugin

429

for ImageJ/Fiji called Mitochondria Analyzer. The plugin is publicly available (28) and includes

430

a graphical user interface to facilitate pre-processing, parameter optimization, image thresholding

431

and automated morphofunctional analysis of mitochondrial images or image stacks, according to

432

the work-flow we have presented (Figure 9).

433

When testing the pipeline, we demonstrated the capability for multi-parameter

434

characterization by performing 2D analyses of β-cells co-stained with MTG and TMRE for

435

simultaneous recordings of changes to mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential.

436

However, the pipeline can in principle be applied to any number of mitochondrial parameters,

437

provided they can be jointly imaged and then quantified using shape- and intensity-based

438

descriptors. We therefore predict that the same type of analysis using a stable mitochondrial label

439

combined with one or more spectrally distinct fluorescent biosensors, e.g. for mitochondrial redox

440

state, matrix Ca2+ or pH, could provide valuable insights into physiological and pathophysiological

441

structure-function relationships in mitochondria. Importantly, the analysis pipeline treats all

442

identified objects separately, and can therefore extract the morphological and functional

443

descriptors on a per-mitochondria basis. In the previous sections we presented our results based

444

on the cellular averages, but the same data-sets contain the descriptors associated with thousands

445

of individual mitochondria and can be mined for a wealth of information about morphometry-

446

physiology correlations and heterogeneity at the organelle level (43, 44). It should also be

447

emphasized that the practical considerations and best-practices we have discussed, and

448

incorporated into our pipeline, are not restricted to β-cell analyses, but can also be applied to other

449

cell types.

450

Finally, the pipeline can in principle also be used to investigate fluorescently labelled

451

organelles other than mitochondria, provided that appropriate thresholding/analysis parameter

452

adjustments can be made. The importance of inter-organelle contacts for cellular function and

453

health are becoming clear, as is the highly complex and dynamic nature of the “organelle

454

interactome” (45-47). Within the technical boundaries associated with standard confocal

455

microscopy, the analysis approaches we have described here can help most research laboratories

456

achieve the level of accuracy needed to explore internal mitochondrial network interactions, and

457

likely also the mitochondrial relationship with other organelles, as we work to clarify the sub-

458

cellular basis of diabetes and other diseases.

Pixel size (x, y) and z-spacing were adjusted as per the calculated optimal Nyquist sampling

508

parameters (38), and pinhole size was reduced to 0.75 AU. The z-step size generally varied

509

between 170-220 nm. Bi-directional scanning was enabled, and all images were acquired using at

510

least three frame averages. Laser power, detector filtering/gating, and gain were adjusted to

511

maximize signal without saturation, while also minimizing background signal, cross-fluorescence,

512

and photobleaching.

514

Time-Lapse 3D Imaging

515

Time-lapse 3D (xyzt) imaging was performed on MIN6 cells transfected with mito-YFP plasmid.

516

Acquisition settings were established as above, and z-stacks were acquired every 45 s for 30 min.

The acquisition time for each stack was approximately 30 s. At the 13 min-mark, FCCP was added

described above. Mito-dsRed was visualized using a 561 nm excitation laser with emission

523

detected between 585 nm to 650 nm. Individual mitochondria were marked for photo-labeling

524

using the “Bleach Point” function in the Leica LasX software, and the PAGFP was activated using

525

a 405 nm laser pulse of 150 ms duration. The activated PAGFP was then imaged using a 488 nm

using the CMLE (Classic Maximum Likelihood Estimation) algorithm with a Signal-to-Noise

532

Ratio of 7.0, maximum iterations of 40, and quality threshold of 0.001. For deconvolution in

533

ImageJ/Fiji, the “PSF Generator” plugin (51) was used to generate a theoretical PSF based on our

534

microscope parameters, and deconvolution was performed with the “DeconvolutionLab2” module

535

utilizing the Richardson-Lucy TV algorithm with regularization set to 0.0001 and maximum

536

iterations of 30 (39, 52).

540

Image Processing and Thresholding

541

The workflow and procedures for image processing and thresholding are summarized in Figure 9.

542

Using ImageJ/Fiji, 2D images or deconvolved 3D image stacks (operating on each slice in the

543

stack) were pre-processed using the following commands: 1) “Subtract Background” (radius =

544

1μm) to remove background noise; 2) “Sigma Filter Plus” (radius = 0.1 μm, 2.0 sigma) to reduce

545

noise and smooth object signal while preserving edges; 3) “Enhance Local Contrast” (block size

546

= 64, slope = 2.0 for 2D and 1.25 for 3D stacks) to enhance dim areas while minimizing noise

547

amplification; and 4) “Gamma Correction” (value = 0.80 for 2D and 0.90 for 3D) (29) to correct

548

any remaining dim areas. To identify mitochondria in the images, we evaluated multiple global

549

and local thresholding algorithms (Figure 2 and Figures S1-S3). Based on our comparisons, we

550

elected to use the “Adaptive Threshold” method (30). In the “Adaptive Threshold” plugin, block

551

size was set to an equivalent of 1.25 μm and the optimal C-value was empirically determined for

552

each image set (See Figure S2 for additional details). The thresholded images were then post-

553

processed using “Despeckle” and then “Remove Outliers” (radius = 0.15 μm2) to remove residual

554

noise. For 3D stacks we additionally applied the “Fill 3D Holes” command from the “3D ROI

555

Manager” plugin (53).

556
557

2D Analysis of Mitochondrial Function, Morphology, and Network Characteristics

558

The approach for quantification of mitochondrial characteristics is summarized in Figure 9. For

559

2D analysis, the image was first processed and thresholded (see above) and the resulting binary

560

image was used as the input for the “Analyze Particles” command (Size = 0.06 μm2-Infinity,

561

Circularity = 0.00-1.00), measuring for “Area”, “Perimeter”, and “Shape Descriptors”. Form

562

Factor (FF) was derived as the inverse of the “Circularity” output value. For network connectivity

563

analysis, the “Skeletonize 2D/3D” command was applied to the thresholded image to produce a

564

skeleton map, and the “Analyze Skeleton” command was used to calculate the number of branches,

565

branch lengths, and branch junctions in the skeletonized network.

566

To simultaneously measure mitochondrial polarisation and morphology, islet cells were

567

co-stained with MTG and TMRE. Our threshold method was first applied to the MTG channel and

568

morphological analysis was done on the identified objects. Additionally, the “Analyze Particles”

569

command (“Add to Manager” option enabled) was used to convert the identified objects

570

(mitochondria) into regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs were then superimposed onto the raw

571

images of the MTG and TMRE channels, and the MTG and TMRE intensities of each individual

572

mitochondrion were measured as the “Mean gray value” obtained via the “Analyze Particles”

573

command. The degree of mitochondrion polarisation was then expressed as the ratio of TMRE to

574

MTG intensity and correlated with mitochondrial morphology on a per-organelle basis.

575
576

3D Analysis of Mitochondrial Morphology and Network Characteristics

577

For 3D analysis, the image stacks were first deconvolved, pre-processed, and thresholded as

578

described above and summarized in Figure 9. Next, the “3D Object Counter” command (Size =

579

0.6 μm3-Infinity) was used to calculate the number of mitochondrial objects and produce a labelled

580

object map. The object map was subsequently used as an input for the “Particle Analyzer 3D”

581

command (part of the MorphoLibJ package) (54) to calculate the volume, sphericity (weighted by

582

volume of the object), and corrected surface area (“Crofton 13 directions” method) of each

583

mitochondrial object. Network connectivity analysis was performed on the skeletonized 3D

584

Unsupervised Categorization of Mitochondrial Morphology using SPADE

588

Spanning-tree Progression Analysis of Density-normalized Events (SPADE v3.0) (32, 33) was

589

used to automatically classify 2D mitochondrial images into 3 different categories based

590

exclusively on their calculated morphological and network parameters. Briefly, mitochondrial

591

parameter data was transformed into a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file using FlowJo V10 and

592

loaded into SPADE. A SPADE tree was created using default settings, without application of

593

arcsinh transformation or removal of outliers. The number of desired clusters was set equal to the

594

total number of images in the data set. The “Auto Suggest Annotation” function was then used to

595

partition the SPADE tree into 2 subgroups and the larger of these was subsequently auto-

596

partitioned again, resulting in a total of 3 subgroups. The data in these SPADE-identified groups

597

were then exported as CSV formatted files for statistical comparison.

598
599

Statistical analysis

600

All data were represented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data were analyzed in

601

GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (La Jolla, California) using Student’s t-test or One-way ANOVA,

Figure 2: Comparison of mitochondrial identification using Global vs Adaptive thresholding methods. (A) Two
representative examples of object identification using Global thresholding (‘Default’ method) vs Adaptive thresholding
(radius = 1.25 μm, C = 11) on images of MIN6-cell mitochondria labelled with Mito-YFP. The number of identified objects
(mitochondria) and their total area are indicated below the images. Scale bar = 1 μm. (B) Part of the mitochondrial network
in a MIN6 cell co-transfected with mito-dsRed and mito-PAGFP. Top - All mitochondria imaged in the mito-dsRed channel.
Bottom left - A single mitochondrion (green) was labeled by laser-based mito-PAGFP activation at the point indicated by
the arrow. Bottom right - Object identification using Global vs Adaptive threshold algorithms applied to the dsRed channel;
in each image, the object that is identified as contiguous with the PAGFP-labelled mitochondrion is shown in green.
Comparison with the original image shows that the Adaptive method more accurately distinguished the photo-labeled
mitochondrion, whereas Global thresholding artificially merged it with adjacent mitochondria. Scale bar = 1 μm. (C)
Quantitative comparison of the degree to which Global and Adaptive thresholding under- or over-estimated the PAGFPlabeled mitochondrion in 5 test images. The corresponding images and details of the estimation algorithm are shown in

at several locations, it will erroneously be identified as separate objects. (B) MIN6 cells were co-transfected with MitodsRed and Mito-PAGFP and photoactivation induced at the point indicated by an arrowhead. Scale bars = 3 µm. Top row

of the raw and deconvolved image stacks. The reduction in axial stretching of objects can be seen in the deconvolved stacks,
with the best improvement achieved using the Huygens algorithm (see additional details in Figure S5 and Supplemental
Table S1). (B) 3D renderings of the z-stack before and after deconvolution with ImageJ or Huygens Professional. All 3D
visualizations were generated using the Huygens 3D object renderer, with a unique colour assigned to separate objects.

Chaudhry et al. – Figure 9

Figure 9: Summary of pipeline for 2D and 3D mitochondrial analysis in ImageJ/Fiji. For illustration, an image stack
was acquired from a MIN6 cell expressing Mito-YFP; a representative slice is shown as the 2D input, and the entire stack
(after deconvolution) as the 3D input. 3D Stacks are represented as maximum projections here. Scale bars = 5 μm. See
main text and Materials & Methods for additional details and parameter values.

Chaudhry et al. – Figure 10

Figure 10: Two-dimensional analysis shows that glucose stimulation is associated with mitochondrial fission in
pancreatic islet cells. Dispersed mouse islet cells were treated in either 3mM glucose (3G) or 17mM glucose (17G) for 60
minutes and then labeled with Hoescht 33342, MitoTracker Green FM (MTG), and TMRE before 2D imaging. (A)
Representative images of a MTG and TMRE stained islet cell in 3G and 17G. (B) TMRE/MTG ratio (normalized to average
3G), indicating the degree of mitochondrial hyperpolarisation. Mitochondrial morphology and polarization were quantified
using our 2D analysis pipeline in Fiji/ImageJ (see Materials and Methods). Comparison of mitochondrial morphometry (C),
and mitochondrial network connectivity (D) demonstrates significant differences between cells acutely treated with low and
stimulatory glucose. All data are represented by mean ± SEM. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001 as determined by
Student’s t-test; n=49 cells in each glucose treatment from 4 mice.
