Abstract

People do not only feel guilty for transgressions of social norms/expectations that
they are causally responsible for, but they also feel guilty for transgressions
committed by those they identify as in-group (i.e., collective or group-based guilt).
However, the neurocognitive basis of group-based guilt and its relation to personal
guilt are unknown. To address these questions, we combined functional MRI with an
interaction-based minimal group paradigm in which participants either directly caused
harm to victims (i.e., personal guilt), or observed in-group members cause harm to the
victims (i.e., group-based guilt). In three experiments (N = 90), we demonstrated that
perceived shared responsibility with in-group members in the transgression predicted
behavioral and neural manifestations of group-based guilt. Multivariate pattern
analysis of the functional MRI data showed that group-based guilt recruited a similar
brain representation in anterior middle cingulate cortex as personal guilt. These results
have broaden our understanding of how group membership is integrated into social
emotions.

Introduction

3

Guilt is viewed as “the emotion most essential to the development of conscience and

4

moral behavior” in psychology (Izard, 1991) and as the “internalized voice of moral

5

authority” in philosophy (Griswold, 2007). Human beings feel guilty for

6

transgressions they are causally responsible for, i.e., when they realize that they are

7

responsible for an action or omission that violates certain moral norms or that they

8

fail to live up to others’ expectations (i.e., personal guilt) (Baumeister, Stillwell, and

9

Heatherton,1994; Chang and Smith, 2011; Izard, 1991). Moreover, guilt can also be

10

encountered in inter-group interactions (Vollberg and Cikara, 2018): individuals may

11

feel guilty for transgressions committed by members of social groups they identify as

12

in-group, even when he/she is not directly responsible for these transgressions.

13

However, the psychological and neural basis of group-based (collective) guilt and its

14

relation to personal guilt are poorly understood.

15
16

As individuals rarely engage in social interactions without social identity or

17

association (Mesquita, Boiger, and De Leersnyder, 2016; Tajfel and Turner, 1986),

18

social emotions arising from such interactions are often tainted by group identity and

19

inter-group appraisals (Mackie, Smith, and Ray, 2008; Smith and Mackie, 2015).

20

Well-known cases of group-based or collective social emotions have been widely

21

debated and reflected upon theoretically (Tollefsen, 2003; Smiley, 2017), and have

22

received considerable empirical investigation in the past decades (Branscombe,

23

Slugoski, and Kappen, 2004; Doosje, Branscombe, Spears, and Manstead, 1998;

24

Ferguson and Branscombe, 2014; Wohl, Branscombe, and Klar, 2006). In this line of

25

research, the most frequently used method for inducing group-based guilt is scenario-

26

based imagination or recall of historical events involving intergroup conflict (Brown,

27

González, Zagefka, Manzi, and Čehajić, 2008; Doosje et al., 1998; McGarty et al.,

28

2005). These studies demonstrated that group-based guilt could facilitate inter-group

29

reconciliation (Doosje, Branscombe, Spears, and Manstead, 2004; Lickel, Steele, and

30

Schmader, 2011), reduce prejudice towards out-group (Amodio, Devine, Harmon-

31

Jones, 2007; Powell, Branscombe, and Schmitt, 2005), and the acceptance of in-group

32

responsibility for transgressions is a critical antecedent of group-based guilt (Castano

33

and Giner-Sorolla, 2006; Čehajić-Clancy, Effron, Halperin, Liberman, and Ross,

34

2011).

35
36

Although the scenarios-based approach has consistently shown that self-reported guilt

37

is elicited and group-based responsibility is perceived when participants are reminded

38

of in-group misdeeds (Brown et al., 2008; Doosje et al., 1998; McGarty et al., 2005),

39

the psychological nature of this pattern remains elusive: (1) Does the self-reported

40

guilt reflect genuine feelings or merely reflect what the participants find morally

41

appropriate for them to express? That is, do the participants express guilt-like

42

sentiments in the absence of genuine feelings of guilt, only to meet social

43

expectations dictating the expression thereof? (2) How does the brain encode group-

44

based guilt? Specifically, does group-based guilt share common neurocognitive

45

processes with personal guilt?

46
47

According to Intergroup Emotion Theory (IET; Mackie et al., 2008; Smith and

48

Mackie, 2015), which posits that group-based emotions are similar to individual-level

49

emotions in most respects (Rydell et al., 2008), we should observe shared cognitive

50

processes (e.g., responsibility acceptance) and brain responses underlying personal

51

and group-based guilt. In contrast, according to Display Rules Hypothesis

52

(Diefendorff and Richard, 2003; Matsumoto, 1993), expressing certain emotions are

53

socially desirable or even morally required for individuals in specific contexts. Even

54

when an individual does not genuinely experience the emotion, he/she will

55

nevertheless display it in order to be socially accepted or avoid sanctions. The Display

56

Rules Hypothesis predicts that the cognitive-emotional processes associated with

57

personal guilt are disparate from those associated with group-based guilt. Thus, if this

58

hypothesis is true, we should not observe similar brain activation patterns for personal

59

guilt and group-based guilt. Instead, we would expect higher activations in brain

60

structures related to social norms and self-control, such as lateral prefrontal cortex

61

(LPFC) (Buckholtz, 2015; Crockett, Siegel, Kurth-Nelson, Dayan, and Dolan, 2017),

62

for group-based guilt because people would force themselves to display an emotion

63

they are not experiencing.

64
65

To test these hypotheses, we developed a paradigm that combines an interpersonal

66

transgression task that induces guilt (Koban, Corradi-Dell'Acqua, and Vuilleumier,

67

2013; Yu, Hu, Hu, and Zhou, 2014) with a minimal group manipulation that induces

68

group identity (Dunham, 2018; Otten, 2016). In this paradigm, we manipulated

69

participants’ relationship with transgressors (i.e., in-group/out-group) and the

70

objective responsibility of the participants for the transgression (i.e., commit

71

(responsible)/observe (not responsible)) in a situation where harm is committed.

72

Specifically, participants either observed two in-group (In-group_ Observe) or two

73

out-group (Out-group_ Observe) members cause harm to an anonymous victim group,

74

or they themselves together with either an in-group (In-group_ Commit) or an out-

75

group (Out-group_ Commit) member directly caused harm to the victims. Then they

76

rated their level of guilt (Experiment 1) or divided 20 yuan (~3 USD) between

77

themselves and the victim group (Experiment 2). The monetary allocation decision,

78

which the participants believed was unknown to the victim group, was included as a

79

measure of reparative motivation and has been shown to be a reliable readout of

80

guilty feeling (Ketelaar and Au, 2003; Yu et al., 2014). We predicted that group-based

81

guilt would manifest as participants feeling guiltier, allocating more money, and

82

having stronger brain activations when in-group members, rather than out-group

83

members, caused harm to the victims. In addition, because shared responsibility plays

84

a crucial role in experiencing group-based guilt, we predicted that shared

85

responsibility may mediate compensatory behaviors through group-based guilt.

86

Additionally, by combining neuroscience measures with this novel paradigm that

87

simultaneously elicits personal and group-based guilt, we adopted conjunction

88

analysis to compare the neurocognitive processes underlying personal guilt and

89

group-based guilt to tease apart the Intergroup Emotion Theory and the Display Rules

Group-based guilt elicited by an interaction-based minimal group paradigm

94

In Experiment 1, six participants were recruited for each experiment session. In

95

Experiment 2, one participant was scanned each time, who would meet five

96

confederates upon arrival at the laboratory. Then they were randomly assigned to a

97

yellow group and a blue group, each consisting of three members. After the group

98

manipulation, the participants played multiple rounds of a dot-estimation game either

99

with two in-group partners or two out-group partners (Fig. 1). They were informed

100

that another group of participants (i.e., victims), whom they would not meet, might

101

have to receive electric shocks depending on the performance of the participants and

102

their two partners (Fig. 2). Post-task manipulation checks revealed that after the

103

minimal group manipulation, the participants identified significantly more with their

104

own group than the other group in all of our experiments (see Supplementary Results

105

for Experiments 1 and 2), indicating successful in-group/out-group manipulation.

recruited each time and were assigned Role A. They were told that another 6
participants (confederates) in another room were assigned Role B. (2) Then the 6 Role
A participants were randomly divided into a ‘Yellow Group’ or ‘Blue Group’ to build
the in-group/out-group context. They were also told that the participants in Role B
were also divided into two 3-member groups. (3) To increase the feeling of affiliation
to the new-built mini-group, each group solved a ‘winter survival problem’ within 6
minutes. (4) After mini-group manipulation, the participants (represented by the leftmost figure of the three stick-figures) played a dot-estimation task with two in-group
(e.g., the two yellow members in the example) or two outgroup partners (e.g., the two
blue members in the example), and one group from Role B (the victims) would
receive a painful shock if Role A (the transgressors) failed.

Fig. 2. Experimental design and procedure. (A) Each trial began by informing the
participant (the left individual) the in-group/outgroup partners he/she was paired with
on the current round. Then a number of dots distributed randomly on the screen were
presented. The participant needed to quickly estimate the number of the dots and
compare the estimation with a specific number which appeared on the next screen.
Then, two out of the three estimations were randomly chosen by two red rectangles
and their correctness would be presented on next screen. If one or two of the chosen
estimations were incorrect, a '×' signal (indicating the failure of the current round)
would be presented, and one group from Role B was randomly chosen to receive pain
stimulation. After pain delivery, the participant rated feelings of guilt on a discrete 0-6
scale (Experiment 1) or allocated a portion of 20 yuan to victims (Experiment 2). The
key screen for FMRI data analysis was the dot-outcome screen (red rectangle). (B)
Different experimental conditions and the corresponding stick-figures presented in the
procedure. In-group_ Observe: the estimations of the two in-group partners were
selected, the estimation of the participant was not selected; Out-group_ Observe: the
estimations of the two out-group partners were selected, and the estimation of the
participant was not selected; In-group_ Commit: the estimation of one in-group
partner was selected, as well as the estimation of the participant; Out-group_ Commit:
the estimation of one out-group partner was selected, and also the estimation of the
participant.

We used linear mixed effects models to examine how group membership (In-group

148

v.s. Out-group) and objective responsibility (Commit v.s. Observe) modulated self-

149

reported guilt (Experiment 1) and compensation behavior (Experiments 2). For both

150

experiments, we found a significant interaction of group membership and objective

151

responsibility on self-reported guilt (Experiment 1, Fig. 3A) and compensation

152

behavior (i.e., monetary allocation; Experiment 2, Fig. 3B). Specifically, participants

153

felt guiltier and allocated more to the victims in the In-group_ Observe condition than

154

the Out-group_ Observe condition (Experiment 1: t = 5.10, p < 0.001; Experiment 2: t

155

= 4.96, p < 0.001, see Table 1 and Supplementary Results for Experiments 1and 2 for

156

more details). This replicated previous findings from scenario-based studies on group-

157

based guilt, namely, people report feeling more guilt for transgressions committed by

158

members of their own group. The behavioral pattern was replicated in a direct

159

replication of Experiment 2 (see Supplementary Results for Experiments 3).

Shared responsibility explains group-based guilt and compensation

186

To investigate the cognitive processes underlying group-based guilt, we examined the

187

role of shared responsibility in group-based guilt. Not surprisingly, participants

188

perceived higher responsibility in the Commit conditions than the Observe conditions,

189

F (1, 23) = 151.17, p < 0.001, η2p = 0.87 for Experiment 1 and F (1, 30) = 65.01, p <

0.001, η2p = 0.68 for Experiment 2. Importantly, and supporting our hypothesis, this

191

effect was modulated by partners’ group membership: the interaction between group

192

membership (In-group v.s. Out-group) and objective responsibility (Commit v.s.

193

Observe) was significant for both experiments (Experiment 1, F (1, 23) = 7.55, p =

194

0.011, η2p = 0.25; Experiment 2, F (1, 30) = 5.41, p = 0.03, η2p = 0.15; see Table 1 for

195

details). Specifically, pairwise comparisons showed that the participants felt more

196

responsible in the In-group_ Observe condition than in the Out-group_ Observe

197

condition, F (1, 23) = 11.38, p = .003, η2p = 0.33 for Experiment 1 and F (1, 30) =

198

11.47, p < 0.001, η2p = 0.28 for Experiment 2. That they had no objective

199

responsibility in either case suggests that the participants ‘inherited’ moral

200

responsibility for transgressions committed by in-group members. Moreover, the

201

difference in perceived responsibility between observing in-group versus out-group

202

transgression was positively correlated both with the difference in self-reported guilt

203

rating (Experiment1, r = 0.45, p = 0.03) and with the difference in monetary

204

allocation (Experiment 2, r = 0.54, p = 0.002) between these two conditions. This

205

indicated that the perceived moral responsibility was associated with the experience

206

of group-based guilt. No significant effect was found for fear and angry emotion. The

207

relationship between perceived moral responsibility in self-reported guilt was

208

replicated in Experiment 3 (see Supplementary Results for Experiments 3).

209
210

Research on personal guilt has suggested that guilt functions as an intermediate state

211

between acknowledging responsibility of transgression and reparative behavior (e.g.,

212

Yu et al., 2014). Here we provided more concrete evidence for this conjecture by a

213

mediation analyses (Preacher and Hayes, 2008). We found a significant indirect path

214

from perceived responsibility via self-reported guilt to monetary allocation (mediating

215

effect estimate = 0.19, SE = 0.09, 95% confidence interval was [0.009, 0.357], see

216

Supplementary Results for Experiments 1 and 2 for detail). Importantly, for group-

217

based guilt, we found a similar indirect pathway via guilt (the mediating effect

218

estimate = 0.18, SE = 0.08, 95% confidence interval [0.003, 0.331] (Fig. 3D), see

219

Supplementary Results for Experiments 1 and 2 for detail). This finding lends support

220

to the Intergroup Emotion Theory, according to which group-based guilt should

221

function in a similar way as personal guilt in mediating the relationship between

222

perceived responsibility and compensation behaviors.

223
224

Brain activations associated with personal and group-based guilt

225

Here we presented the brain activation patterns revealed by the contrasts hypothesized

226

to reflect group-based and personal guilt, respectively. The activation patterns

227

corresponding to the main effects of Objective responsibility and Group can be found

228

in Supplementary Neuroimaging Results.

229
230

To identify brain regions associated with group-based guilt, we focused on brain

231

responses associated with the outcome feedback of dot estimation. We defined the

232

critical contrast “In-group_ Observe > Out-group_ Observe”, which corresponds to

233

the effect of group-based guilt. This contrast revealed activations in anterior middle

and right AI have been consistently implicated in imagining and experiencing

237

personal guilt (Chang et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2014) and negative self-evaluation in

238

social contexts (Immordino-Yang, McColl, Damasio, Damasio., 2009; Kédia et al.,

241

extracted the regional parameter estimates from 27 voxels around the peak

242

coordinates at aMCC and right AI. The parameter estimates extracted from aMCC

243

(Fig. 4B) and right AI (Fig. 4C) exhibited a pattern similar to the pattern of monetary

244

allocation. Moreover, aMCC activation difference (In-group_ Observe > Out-group_

245

Observe) positively correlated with the post-scan guilt rating difference between these

246

two conditions (r = 0.45, p = 0.011), indicating that the aMCC was involved in the

247

processing of group-based guilt.

258

We next examined whether group-based guilt shared a similar neurocognitive process

259

with personal guilt. In the current study, ‘personal guilt’ was defined by the contrast

260

‘Out-group_ Commit > Out-group_ Observe’. This contrast, while keeping the impact

261

of group membership to its minimal, captured the difference in the participants’ causal

262

contribution to the transgression, thereby reflecting neural processing of personal

263

guilt. Replicating previous neuroimaging findings about personal guilt (Koban et al.,

264

2013; Yu et al., 2014), this contrast (Out-group_ Commit > Out-group_ Observe)

265

revealed the activations in aMCC (MNI coordinates = [12, 17, 40]; k= 153 voxels)

266

and supplementary motor area (SMA) (MNI coordinates = [15, 5, 67]; k= 62 voxels)

280

We extracted the regional parameter estimates from 27 voxels around the peak

281

coordinates of aMCC (Fig. 5B) and further demonstrated that the aMCC activation

282

difference (Out-group_ Commit > Out-group_ Observe) was positively correlated

283

with the difference in self-reported guilt between these two conditions (r = 0.45, p =

284

0.012). The right AI has been implicated in representing personal guilt (Kédia et al.,

285

2008; Koban et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014). We extracted the regional parameter

286

estimates from 27 voxels around the peak coordinates of an indepdendetly defined

287

right AI region of interest ([36, 30,-8], coordinates reported in Yu et al., 2014). The

288

activations within this ROI (Fig. 5C) showed a similar pattern with that of the aMCC.

289

Statistical analysis further confirmed that for this ROI, the activation in the Out-

290

group_ Commit condition is stronger than in the Out-group_ Observe condition, t =

291

2.75, p = 0.01.

contrast (In-group_ Observe > Out-group_ Observe) and for the personal guilt

296

contrast (Out-group_ Commit > Out-group_ Observe). This suggested the possibility

297

of a shared neuropsychological processes underlying these two forms of guilt. To

298

examine this in a more principled way, we first performed a conjunction analysis

299

between the aforementioned contrasts. The overlapping region identified from the

300

conjunction analysis confirmed that the overlapped aMCC ((MNI coordinates = [6,

301

302

guilt. Moreover, we performed a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) as a

303

supplementary analysis in the overlapped aMCC region to further test whether the

304

neural representations of group-based guilt was similar to those of personal guilt. We

305

demonstrated that the classifier trained on the personal guilt conditions within the

306

overlapped aMCC region can distinguish different levels of personal guilt in a leave-

307

one-subject-out cross-validation test (accuracy = 68% ±6%, p < 0.001; Fig. 6B).

308

More importantly, the classifier can also discriminate the two group-based guilt

309

conditions (Out-group_ Commit v.s. Out-group_ Observe) with an accuracy of 71% ±

310

8%, p = 0.01 (Fig. 6B), demonstrating that the neural representations of personal guilt

could discriminate those of group-based guilt.

Discussion

323

In this study, we revealed neurocognitive profiles of group-based guilt and

324

demonstrated its similarity with personal guilt. Specifically, shared responsibility for

325

in-group transgressions is a crucial cognitive antecedent of group-based guilt just as

326

personal, objective responsibility is crucial for personal guilt (Baumeister et al., 1994;

327

Hoffman, 2001; Zahn-Waxler and Kochanska, 1990). Moreover, analysis of fMRI

328

data suggested shared neuropsychological processes underlying these two forms of

329

guilt. Our findings thus provide evidence for the Intergroup Emotion Theory account

330

of group-based emotion (Mackie et al., 2008; Smith and Mackie, 2015), which posits

331

that the neurocognitive machinery for individual-level emotions are co-opted in the

332

group context.

333
334

Previous research on personal guilt has demonstrated that the sense of responsibility

335

in causing suffering is closely related to the experience of guilt (Hoffman, 2001;

336

Zahn-Waxler and Kochanska, 1990). Similarly, the perceived moral responsibility is

337

also an important antecedent of group-based guilt (Čehajić-Clancy et al., 2011; Iyer et

338

al., 2004). As demonstrated in the present study, although the participants had no

339

personal contribution to transgressions in the Observe conditions, they shared greater

340

moral responsibility for transgressions committed by in-group partners than out-group

341

partners, and this vicarious responsibility was positively associated with the guilt

342

rating (In-group_ Observe > Out-group_ Observe). These results are consistent with

343

the shared responsibility account of group-based guilt (Smiley, 2017; Tollefsen,
19

344

2006): that individuals who identify themselves with a group acting badly would feel

345

jointly responsible for the bad behaviors of the group. According to social identity

346

theory (Tajfel and Turner, 1986), when people categorize themselves as a member of a

347

group, and internalize the group component into self-concept, the actions of other in-

348

group members will have a direct influence on self-perception. Thus, this ‘vicarious’

349

moral responsibility for in-group transgressions may result from the shared group

350

membership with the harm-doers (Tajfel and Turner, 1986; Wohl et al., 2006). In a

351

broader sense, these results suggested that responsibility, inasmuch as it is relevant for

352

appraisals of social emotions, need be construed more broadly to include the sense of

353

responsibility an individual inherited from their group identities. More importantly,

354

our study, perhaps for the first time, demonstrates that similarities between group-

355

based and personal guilt goes beyond self-reported emotional experience; the

356

similarity is rooted in the neurobiology of emotional appraisal, lending support to the

357

Intergroup Emotion Theory (Smith, 1993; Smith and Mackie, 2015). According to this

358

theory, group members feel emotions in response to events affecting other in-group

359

members as if those events were happening to themselves. An implication of this

360

theory is that group-based emotions and personal emotions may share common

361

neurocognitive substrates (Rydell et al., 2008). Our findings provide direct neural

362

evidence for this hypothesis: aMCC responses to an in-group partners’ transgressions

363

(relative to an out-group’s transgression) was positively associated with increased

364

ratings of guilt, suggesting that aMCC is involved in experiencing group-based guilt.

366

Our findings shed new light on the role of aMCC in social-affective processing,

367

extending its functional significance to inter-group processes (Lamm, Decety, and

368

Singer, 2011; Shackman, Salomons, Slagter, Fox, Winter and Davidson, 2011). Thus,

369

the aMCC activations here for transgressions made by an in-group partner may reflect

370

the vicarious ‘personal guilt’ elicited by the perceived moral responsibility for

371

transgressions, and raising the possibility of a shared neuropsychological process

372

underlying these two forms of guilt (Woo et al., 2014). This possibility was further

373

corroborated by our multivariate analyses (Chang et al., 2015; Wager et al., 2013)

374

examining the similarity of neural representations of personal guilt and group-based

375

guilt: our classifier trained on the personal guilt conditions could dissociate the group-

376

based guilt conditions, suggesting that the group-based guilt could be developed on

377

the basis of personal guilt.

378
379

Scenario-based imagination or recall of historical events involving intergroup conflict

380

have been widely used to induce group-based guilt in previous studies (Branscombe

381

et al., 2004; Brown et al., 2008; Doosje et al., 1998; McGarty et al., 2005), which laid

382

a foundation for further research on group-based guilt. However, this approach’s

383

strength of high ecological validity often comes at the cost of a well-controlled

384

experimental manipulation, for example, by confounding group-based guilt with the

385

level of harm inflicted on the victims (because the critical comparison in those studies

386

is typically between a scenario depicting inter-group harm and a scenario depicting no

387

harm). Thus, emotion measures obtained in these studies may be moderated by

388

different levels of empathy or compassion for the victims (Branscombe et al., 2004;

389

Brown et al., 2008; Doosje et al., 1998; McGarty et al., 2005). To address these

390

pitfalls, in the current study, we assessed group-based guilt by comparing

391

transgressions committed by in-group partners with identical transgressions

392

committed by out-group partners (In-group_ Observe > Out-group_ Observe).

393

Because the nature and extent of transgression is matched, any differential effect can

394

thus be attributed to group membership (i.e., in-group/out-group).

395
396

Besides, the historical scenario-based method used in previous research limits the

397

investigation of group-based guilt to the populations with a history of intergroup

398

conflict (e.g., the intergroup conflicts between Israeli and Palestinians), which hinders

399

the generalizability of the empirical evidence for conceptualizing group-based guilt as

400

a universal psychological capacity. A strength of the interaction-based minimal group

401

paradigm is that it extends the investigation of group-based guilt into populations

402

without historical intergroup conflict. More importantly, the use of a minimal group

403

paradigm provides a flexible experimental tool that could induce the intergroup

404

emotion in a live and dynamic laboratory setting, thereby enabling a well-controlled

405

laboratory study on group-based guilt to be conducted in natural circumstances. The

406

investigation of the neuroscience of intergroup emotion is a relatively recent

407

development within social psychology, but one that reflects a rapidly expanding

408

interest in the interface between emotions and intergroup relations (Vollberg and

409

Cikara, 2018). Following this trend, our interaction-based mini-group paradigm

provides a flexible experimental tool to investigate the neural basis of group-based

411

guilt.

412
413

Conclusion

414

By combining fMRI with an interactive collective game, we provide behavioral and

415

neural evidence demonstrating that group-based (collective) guilt and personal guilt

416

share similar neurocognitive mechanisms. These findings provide neural evidence for

417

the hypotheses that members of a group feel emotions in response to events affecting

418

other in-group members as if those events affected them personally (Smith, 1993;

419

Smith and Mackie, 2015). We highlight the crucial role of perceived responsibility in

420

group-based guilt, which may help design interventions aimed at reducing

421

unnecessary and excessive guilt inherited from past generations or other group

422

members. Our findings shed light on the brain processes through which group

423

membership is integrated into emotion appraisal, bridging gaps between research on

424

emotion and inter-group relationship.

Participants

428

For Experiment 1 (behavioral experiment), we recruited 24 participants (12 females,

429

mean age 19.3 ± 0.8 years). For Experiment 2 (fMRI experiment), thirty-five right-

430

handed participants completed the experiment, four of which were excluded due to

431

excessive head motion (>3 mm), leaving 31 participants (19 females, mean age 21.3 ±

432

1.1 years) in data analysis. None of the participants reported any history of neurological

433

or psychological disorders. Written informed consent was obtained from every

434

participant before the experiments. This study was carried out in accordance with the

Overview. In the current experiment, six participants of the same sex were recruited on

446

each experimental session (none of them had known one another before the session).

447

Upon arrival, participants were told that all six of them were predetermined to be

448

assigned to group A (Transgressor-group) and six further co-players (confederates of

449

the experimenter) in another room were assigned to group B (Victim-group). The task

450

consisted of two phases. In the first, minimal group manipulation phase, the six

451

participants of group A were randomly divided into two sub-groups of three members

452

each to build in-group/out-group context; in the second phase, the participants played

453

multiple rounds of a dot-estimation game either with two in-group partners or two out-

454

group partners. The victims would receive electric shocks depending on the

455

performance of the participant and /or his/her partners (Fig. 1). The participants were

456

explicitly told that the victims could not reciprocate the electric shocks.

457
458

Minimal group manipulation. In the first phase, the six participants of group A were

459

randomly divided into two sub-groups of three members each (a “Yellow Group” and

460

a “Blue Group"). They were asked to wear a yellow or a blue T-shirt corresponding to

461

their group membership. Each sub-group was required to work together to solve a

462

"winter survival problem"(Johnson and Johnson, 1991) to enhance group identity. The

463

background of the winter survival problem is that the plane the participants took had

464

crash-landed in the woods of a northeastern region in mid-January, and they were

465

required to rank-order 10 items salvaged from the broken plane (a lighter, a chocolate

466

bar, a gun, newspaper, etc.) according to their importance for survival. The 3 individuals

467

needed to discuss the problem together and reach a single consensus ranking within 6

468

min. As a manipulation check, we asked the participants to complete a scale of

psychological distance to their group (a modified version of Inclusion of Others; Aron,

470

Aron , and Smollan, 1992) and a 6-item questionnaire of group identity (example items

471

include “How much do you identify with the Yellow group?” and “To what extent do

472

you feel strong ties with the Yellow group?”; Falk, Heine, and Takemura, 2014)

473

immediately after the mini-group manipulation. Player As were explicitly told that

474

player Bs were also divided into two 3-member groups.

476

Pain calibration. After the group manipulation, participants were told that the victims

477

(i.e., the confederates) would receive pain stimulation if the participants failed in their

478

dot-estimation task (see below). To familiarize participants with the pain stimulation,

479

all the participants underwent a pain calibration procedure. An intra-epidermal needle

480

electrode was attached to the left wrist of participants for cutaneous electrical

481

stimulation (Inui et al., 2002). Pain calibration begun with 8 repeated pulses (with each

482

pulse having 0.2 mA and lasted for 5 ms with a 10 ms inter-pulse interval). Then we

483

gradually increased the intensity of each pulse until participants reported 7 on a scale

484

from 1 (‘not painful’) to 8 (‘intolerable’). All participants reported that the pain

485

stimulation rated as 7 was really painful. They were told that the victims underwent the

486

same pain calibration procedure and that the victims would receive the pain stimulation

487

they rated as 7 if the transgressors failed in the dot-estimation task.

492

middle and right of the three stick-figures in the screens of Fig. 2A) were from the

493

“Yellow Group” or the “Blue Group”. Each of the three players was required to estimate

494

the number of dots presented on the screen, press a corresponding button to indicate

495

whether their estimate was 'More' or 'Less' than a reference number presented on the

496

screen (randomly chosen from 19, 20, 21, and 22), and then press a button to confirm

497

their choice. If the participant failed to confirm his/her choice within 2 seconds, the

498

current trial would start again with a different dots map presented. The participants

499

were explicitly told that the average accuracy for the dot-estimation task is 75%, to

500

make them believe that they could estimate correctly. Two out of the three responses in

501

the current round were randomly selected, as indicated by two red rectangles, and the

502

outcome (success or failure) was presented on the next screen (see below for details on

503

the different combinations of response selections). If the chosen estimates were both

504

correct (i.e., filler trials), an 'O' sign would appear on the screen indicating that the

505

current trial was successful and no painful stimulation would be delivered. The current

506

trial terminated there. If one or both of the selected estimations were incorrect (i.e.,

507

experimental trials, Fig. 2B), a '×' sign indicating failure of the current round was

508

presented and one victim group of group B would be randomly selected to receive pain

509

stimulation, as indicated by a shock sign appearing on the screen. Then, the participant

510

was asked to rate his/her level of guilt on a 0-6 scale (in increments of 1) by pressing a

511

key to increase or decrease the rating before pressing the space bar to confirm his/her

512

choice.

The experimental trials (i.e., failure trials) consisted of the four combinations of the two

515

experimental factors, namely, Group membership (In-group v.s. Out-group) and

516

Objective responsibility (Commit v.s. Observe), forming a 2× 2 within-participant

517

design. 'Group membership' refers to the group membership of the two partners and

518

'Objective responsibility' refers to whether the participant’s performance was selected

519

and therefore directly involved in causing harm to the victims. Hence there were four

520

experimental conditions: 1) the estimations of the two in-group partners were selected,

521

and the estimation of the participant was not selected (In-group_ Observe); 2) the

522

estimations of the two out-group partners were selected, and the estimation of the

523

participant was not selected (Out-group_ Observe); 3) the estimation of one in-group

524

partner was selected as well as the estimation of the participant (In-group_ Commit);

525

and 4) the estimation of one out-group partner was selected as well as the estimation of

526

the participant (Out-group_ Commit). Similarly, there were 4 possible combinations for

527

success trials corresponding to the four experimental conditions and they were the filler

528

trials. Unknown to the participants, the outcome of each trial was predetermined by a

529

computer program, ensuring that all the conditions had the same number of trials.

530
531

The experiment consisted of 84 trials (16 for each experimental condition, and 5 for

532

each filler combination). Trials were presented in a pseudorandom order to each

533

participant with the constraint that no more than three consecutive trials were from the

534

same condition. After the experiment, each participant rated on a 9-point Likert scale

535

(1 = ‘not at all’, 9 = ‘very strong’), indicating his/her responsibility, fear, and anger in

536

the four experimental conditions. After the experiment, each participant received 50

537

yuan (~7.7 USD) for participation.

538
539

Procedures of Experiment 2 (fMRI)

540

Procedures of Experiment 2 were identical to those of Experiment 1, except that 1) one

541

participant was recruited each time for scanning, and the participant met five

542

confederates (2 male, 3 female, 23.6 ± 1.3 years) upon arrival at the laboratory; 2) at

543

the end of each estimation-failure round, instead of rating feelings of guilt, the

544

participant was asked to divide 20 yuan (~3 USD) between him/herself and the 3 player

545

Bs who received the pain stimulation, with the knowledge that the player Bs were

546

unaware of the existence of this money distribution. The monetary allocation decision

547

was included as a measure of reparative motivation and has been shown to be a reliable

548

readout of guilty feeling (Ketelaar and Au, 2003; Yu et al., 2014). Thus, the amount

549

allocated to the player Bs was interpreted as a measure of compensation for electric

550

shocks. After scanning, participants rated their responsibility, fear, anger, and guilt on

551

a 9-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 9 = very strong) for each of the four experimental

552

conditions. At end of Experiment 2, one trial was randomly selected and actualized as

553

an extra payment. Thus, the participants’ final payoff was the baseline payoff (100 yuan,

554

approximately 15 USD) and the amount of allocation the participants left for

555

themselves.

Direct replication of the behavioral findings of Experiment 2

558

To confirm the stability of the behavioral patterns observed in the fMRI experiment,

559

we performed a behavioral experiment (Experiment 3) with the same procedures as the

560

fMRI experiment in an independent sample of 36 participants, but with 6 same-sex

561

participants recruited each time as in Experiment 1. One participant was excluded due

562

to a technical error, leaving 35 (23 female, mean age 21.7±0.9 years) for data analysis.

563
564

Behavioral data analysis

565

The behavioral data were analyzed using linear mixed effects models implemented in

566

the R software environment with the Imer4 package (Baayen, Davidson, and Bates,

567

2008; Bates, Mächler, Bolker, and Walker, 2014). To check how the Group (In-group

568

v.s. Out-group) and the Objective responsibility (Commit v.s. Observe) modulated the

569

guilt rating (Experiment 1) or compensation behavior (Experiments 2 and 3), the

570

current LMM included two fixed-effect variables (Group and Objective responsibility)

571

and their possible interactions, and one random factor (participants).To control for any

572

potential confounding effects, we added all fixed factors (Group, Objective

573

responsibility, and Group × Objective responsibility) into random slopes to better

574

generalize the LMM analysis (Barr et al., 2013).

575
576

For all the mediation analyses in our study, we bootstrapped the mediating effect 20,000

577

times using the SPSS version of the INDIRECT macro (http://www.afhayes.com/)

Imaging Data acquisition

582

Imaging data were acquired using a Siemens 3.0 Tesla Prisma scanner at the Beijing

583

MRI Centre for Brain Research at Peking University (China). T2*-weighted echo-

584

planar images (EPI) with blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were

585

collected in 33 axial slices parallel to the anterior-posterior commissure line to ensure

586

coverage of the whole cerebrum (matrix 64 × 64, in planar resolution). Images were

587

acquired in an interleaved order with no inter-slice gap (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms,

588

voxel size = 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm ×3.5 mm, field of view = 224 mm ×224 mm, flip angle

589

= 90°). A high-resolution, whole-brain structural scan (1×1×1 mm3 isotropic voxel

590

MPRAGE) was acquired before functional imaging.

591
592

Imaging Data preprocessing

593

The fMRI images were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software

594

SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK). The first five volumes

595

of each run were discarded to allow for stabilization of magnetization. The remaining

596

images were slice-time corrected, motion-corrected, re-sampled to 3×3×3 mm3

597

isotropic voxels, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space,

598

spatially smoothed using an 8-mm full width at half maximum Gaussian filter, and

599

temporally filtered using a high-pass filter with 1/128 Hz cutoff frequency.

Whole-brain General Linear Model Analyses.

602

Whole-brain exploratory analysis based on the general linear model was conducted first

603

at the participant level, and then at the group level. To examine the neural responses to

604

transgression outcomes, the data analysis focused on the brain responses associated

605

with the presentation of the dot estimation outcomes. At the participant-level statistical

606

analysis, failed dots-estimation outcomes corresponding to the four experimental

607

conditions and 18 other regressors were separately modeled in a General Linear Model

608

(GLM). Separate regressors in GLM were specified for fMRI responses to:

609



R1: Combined regressor of no interest (duration = 4.3 s), which consisted of the

610

presentation of the in-group/outgroup partners whom the participant paired with

611

(“paired partners” screen), the dot map, and participants’ dot-estimation responses

612

(“dot estimations” screens);

613



R2-R5: Cue for involvement screen (duration = 2 s), which was indicated by a

614

red rectangle around 2 of the 3 silhouettes. Each of the four experimental

615

conditions was modeled in a separate regressor;

616



four experimental conditions;

617
618

R6-R9: Failed dot-estimation outcomes (2 s), separately modeled for each of the



R10-R13: Successful dot-estimation outcomes (2 s), separately modeled for each
of the four filler conditions;

619
620



R14: The presentation of pain shock cue (1.5 s);

621



R15: Allocation screen, which required the participant to allocate 20 yuan

622

between him/herself and the victims (5 s);

623



R16: Missed trials (4.3 s);

624



R17-R22: Six head motion parameters, which were modeled separately in the
GLM to account for artifacts in the scanner signal.

625
626
627

All regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. At

628

the group-level, the four beta maps corresponding to the four experimental conditions

629

of each transgressor were fed into a flexible factorial design matrix.

630

At the group-level, we defined the following contrasts:

631



group-based guilt: In-group_ Observe > Out-group_ Observe;

632



personal guilt: Out-group_ Commit > Out-group_ Observe ;

633



main effect of objective responsibility: (In-group_ Commit + Out-group_
Commit) > (In-group_ Observe + Out-group_ Observe);

634
635
636



main effect of group membership: (In-group_ Commit + In-group_ Observe) >
(Out-group_ Commit + Out-group_ Observe);

637

We focused on the group-based guilt contrast (In-group_ Observe > Out-group_

638

Observe) and the personal guilt contrast (Out-group_ Commit > Out-group_ Observe)

639

as they were the main concern of our study. We took the simple effect contrast ‘In-

640

group_ Observe > Out-group_ Observe’ as the defining contrast for group-based guilt

641

because the victim’s harm as well as participants’ causal contribution to the harm were

642

identical in these two conditions; the only difference was participants’ relationship with

643

the transgressor. In the current study, ‘personal guilt’ was defined by the contrast ‘Out-

644

group_ Commit > Out-group_ Observe’. This contrast, while keeping the impact of

645

group membership to its minimal, captured the difference in the participants’ causal

646

contribution to the transgression thereby reflected neural processing of personal guilt.

647

Conjunction analyses

648

To identify brain areas that are shared by personal guilt and group-based guilt, we

649

performed a conjunction analysis (Price and Friston, 1997) over the personal guilt

650

contrast (Out-group_ Commit > Out-group_ Observe) and the group-based guilt

651

contrast (In-group_ Observe > Out-group_ Observe). Conjunction analysis allowed us

652

to combine these two comparisons to look for areas shared by personal guilt and group-

653

based guilt while simultaneously eliminating areas activated in only one of the

654

comparisons. Thus, this approach both increases statistical power (relative to only

655

looking at, for example, the personal guilt contrast or the group-based guilt contrast),

656

while also eliminating comparison specific activations which may reflect idiosyncratic

657

influences of one of these two contrasts (Price and Friston, 1997). This conjunction was

658

formulated as conjunction null hypothesis (Friston et al., 2005; Nichols et al., 2005)

659

and should therefore only yield activations that are significantly present in both original

660

contrasts of the conjunction. The null hypothesis for “conjunction null hypothesis” is

661

that “not all contrasts activated this voxel.” If the conjunction results are significant,

662

the null hypothesis is rejected and the conclusion is that “all contrasts activated this

663

voxel.” That is, conjunctions represent a logical ‘and’, requiring both contrasts to be

664

separately significant for the conjunction to be significant.

Multivariate pattern analysis of imaging data

667

Compared to the univariate analysis, the Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) could

668

increase the amount of information that can be decoded from brain activity (i.e. spatial

669

pattern). Thus, a supplementary MVPA analysis was carried out in the conjunction

670

region to check whether the spatial pattern of group-based guilt similar to those of

671

personal guilt. We used linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Friedman et al., 2001;

672

Wager et al., 2013) to train a multivariate pattern classifier on personal guilt trials and

673

apply the classifier to discriminate group-based guilt. With a leave-one-out cross-

674

validation method, we calculated the accuracy of the SVM classifiers using the forced-

675

choice test (Chang et al., 2015; Wager et al., 2013; Woo et al., 2014). We also calculated

676

the accuracy for In-group_ Observe v.s. Out-group_ Observe. To be noted that, in case

677

the SVM effects were driven solely by the effects of response amplitude already

678

observed in the GLM analysis, the mean univariate response magnitude in the

679

overlapped region was subtracted (Coutanche, 2013; Smith, Kosillo, and Williams,

680

2011)

Experimental Design
To explore the neurocognitive mechanism of group-based guilt and its relationship
with personal guilt, we developed a minimal group-based interpersonal game to
induce and simultaneously measure group-based guilt and personal guilt. In this
paradigm, the participants are either involved in harm to the victims, or merely
observe in-group or out-group members cause harm to the victims (i.e., group-based
guilt), forming a 2 Group (In-group v.s. Out-group) ×2 Objective responsibility
(Commit v.s. Observe) within-participant design. For group-based guilt, by observing
guilt rating and money allocation following harm caused by in-group/out-group
members, we could trace how group membership shapes individuals’ emotion and
social decision making. Moreover, by combining the game paradigm with functional
MRI, we explore the neural substrates of group-based guilt, and examine whether
there are common neurocognitive processes underlying group-based guilt and
personal guilt.

Supplementary Results for Experiments 1 and 2
Minimal group manipulation check. As a manipulation check, we first examined
whether the participants felt closer to the in-group than to the out-group. In Experiment
1, paired sample t-test showed that the participants indeed felt closer to and had stronger
identity with the in-group partners than the out-group partners: closeness, 4.7 ±0.2 v.s.
2.7 ± 0.2, t (23) = 10.0, p < 0.001, d = 2.08; identity, 5.4 ± 0.2 v.s. 3.5 ± 0.2, t (23) =
9.8, p < 0.001, d = 1.99. This was also true for Experiment 2. The participants felt closer
to and identified more with the in-group partners than the out-group partners: closeness,

4.4 ±0.3 v.s. 2.7 ±0.2, t (30) = 7.8, p < 0.001, d = 1.41; identity, 4.0 ±0.2 v.s. 3.1 ±0.2,
t (30) = 4.3, p < 0.001, d = 0.77. These results confirmed the success of in-group/outgroup manipulation.

Group-based guilt elicited by an interaction-based mini-group paradigm. We
examined the patterns of online guilt rating (Experiment 1) and monetary allocation
(Experiment 2) using linear mixed effects. We found that in Experiment 1,
participants felt more guilty when harm was caused by in-group partners than by outgroup partners, β = 0.29, SE = 0.06, t = 4.90, p < 0.001, and when they committed in
the harm than when they just observed the harm, β = 0.68, SE = 0.08, t = 8.50, p <
0.001, (Table 1; Fig. 3A). The Group × Objective responsibility interaction (β = 0.08,
SE = 0.04, t = 2.26, p = 0.03) showed that the participants felt more guilty in the Ingroup_ Observe condition than the Out-group_ Observe condition, β = 0.37, SE =
0.07, t = 5.10, p < 0.001; the participants also felt more guilty in the In-group_
Commit condition than the Out-group_ Commit condition, β = 0.21, SE = 0.06, t =
3.22, p < 0.001. The guilt difference in Observe conditions (In-group_ Observe >
Out-group_ Observe, 0.74) was bigger than Commit conditions (In-group_ Commit >
Out-group_ Commit, 0.42), demonstrating that the group membership exerted a larger
modulation on guilt rating when the participants were not causally involved in harm
than when they were.

The pattern of monetary allocation (compensation behavior) in Experiment 2 was
similar to the pattern of guilt rating in Experiment 1(Fig. 3B). Participants
compensated more when the harm was caused by in-group partners than out-group
partners, β = 0.38, SE = 0.11, t = 3.53, p < 0.001, and when they themselves
committed the harm than when they just observe the harm, β = 0.73, SE = 0.09, t =
7.44, p < 0.001. The Group × Objective responsibility interaction (β = 0.16, SE =
0.08, t = 2.14, p = 0.04) showed that the participants allocated more in the In-group_
Observe condition than in the Out-group_ observe condition, β = 0.63, SE = 0.13, t =
4.96, p < 0.001; the allocation difference between In-group_ Commit condition and
Out-group_ Commit condition was not significant, β = 0.22, SE = 0.13, t = 1.71, p >
0.05. Moreover, the allocation difference in Observe conditions (In-group_ Observe >
Out-group_ Observe) was positively associated with the corresponding post-scan guilt
rating difference, r = 0.40, p = 0.02 (Fig. 3C). The higher the guilt rating, the more
allocation to the victims, suggesting that the monetary allocation was motivated by
prosocial emotion (i.e., group-based guilt), further confirming that our online measure
(i.e., monetary allocation) captured the affective responses elicited by the interactive
task. All of the above patterns were replicated in the replication Experiment 3 (see
Supplementary Results of Experiment 3).

Shared responsibility explains group-based guilt and reparation. Research on
personal guilt and reparative behavior has provided hints that guilt functions as an
intermediate state between acknowledging responsibility of transgression and

reparative behavior (Koban et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014). We conceptually replicated
this pattern for personal guilt by a mediation analyses (Preacher and Hayes, 2008).
For Experiments 2 and3, the correlation between the perceived responsibility and
monetary allocation was not significant (r = 0.26, p = 0.11) in Experiment 2, and was
significant (r = 0.37, p = 0.04) in Experiment 3. Thus, to confirm whether the
perceived responsibility correlated with monetary allocation, we combined
Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 together to increase sample size. The results showed
that the perceived responsibility was positively correlated with monetary allocation r
= 0.28, p = 0.009, and the guilt rating was both related to the perceived responsibility
(r = 0.56, p < 0.001) and monetary allocation (r = 0.39, p = 0.001). We then
conducted mediation analyses to examine whether the effects of the perceived
responsibility on monetary allocation was mediated by guilt rating. Results revealed a
significant mediation effect of guilt rating on the relationship between the perceived
responsibility and monetary allocation: the mediating effect estimate = 0.19, SE =
0.09, 95% bias corrected confidence interval was [0.009, 0.357]. According to IET,
group-based guilt should function in a similar way as personal guilt in mediating the
relationship between perceived responsibility and reparation. The same mediation
analyses was thus then performed for group-based guilt. Consistent with this
hypothesis, after combining the Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 together, we found an
intermediate role of guilt between acknowledging responsibility of transgression and
reparative behavior: the mediating effect estimate = 0.18, SE = 0.08, 95% bias
corrected confidence interval [0.003, 0.331], Fig. 3D. ).

Supplementary Results of Experiment 3

Behavioral validation experiment (Experiment 3). The Experiment 3 was conducted
with exactly the same procedures and parameters as Experiment 2 to confirm the
stability of the behavioral patterns observed in the fMRI experiment. The manipulation
checks (i.e., the IOS scale and group identity questionnaire) showed that the participants
felt closer to and had stronger identity with the in-group partners than the out-group
partners: closeness, 4.7 ± 0.2 v.s. 2.8 ± 0.2, t (34) = 10.0, p < 0.001, d = 1.66; identity,
5.4 ±0.2 v.s. 3.5 ±0.1, t (34) = 14.9, p < 0.001, d = 1.67. These results were consistent
with Experiments 1 and 2, suggesting that the creation of the in-group/out-group
context was successful in Experiment 3.

To confirm the stability of the behavioral patterns observed in Experiment 2, we
examined the online monetary allocation in Experiment 3, and found that its patterns
was the same as the pattern in the fMRI experiment. Specifically, the participants
compensated more when the harm was caused by in-group partners than out-group

partners, β = 0.52, SE = 0.11, t = 4.68, p < 0.001 and when they themselves committed
the harm than when they were not, β = 0.79, SE = 0.14, t = 5.63, p < 0.001 (see Fig.
S1). The Group × Objective responsibility was significant, β = 0.11, SE = 0.05, t =
2.28, p = 0.02. Further tests showed that the participants allocated more in the In-group_
Observe condition than in the Out-group_ Observe condition, β = 0.63, SE = 0.13, t =
4.96, p < 0.001; the participants also allocated more in the In-group_ Commit condition
than in the Out-group_ Commit condition, β = 0.41, SE = 0.11, t = 3.56, p < 0.001. The
allocation difference in the Observe conditions (In-group_ Observe > Out-group_
Observe, 1.31) was bigger than the Commit conditions (In-group_ Commit > Outgroup_ Commit, 0.84), suggesting that the group membership exerted a larger
modulation on monetary allocation when in the Observe conditions than in the Commit
conditions. Moreover, consistent with the fMRI experiment, the allocation difference
in Observe conditions was positively associated with the corresponding post-scan guilt
rating difference, r = 0.48, p = 0.003.

We also examined the role of the perceived responsibility sharing in experiencing
group-based guilt in Experiment 3. Specifically, Consistent with Experiment 2, the
Group membership by Objective responsibility two-way ANOVA analysis on the sense
of responsibility was significant, F (1, 34) = 4.35, P = 0.04 (Table S1). Planned t tests
showed that participants sensed a higher level of responsibility in the In-group_
Observe condition than in the Out-group_ Observe condition, t (34) = 28.75, p < 0.001,
and the difference of the perceived shared responsibility between these two conditions
